0,Introduction,"Hydrogen does not contribute to the greenhouse effect and it has a high energy yield (142 kJ/g) which is 2.75 times more than that of any hydrocarbon [1]. Biological hydrogen production is potentially regarded as one of the most promising alternatives for sustainable green energy production despite the feasibility of hydrogen production through water electrolysis and chemical cracking of hydrocarbons. Among different biological processes for hydrogen production dark fermentation is the most attractive one because of its potential of direct use of wastewater streams and organic wastes and its higher rate of hydrogen production in comparison with photo-fermentative processes [2,3]. However, this process has not been commercialized yet mainly due to long term instability attributed to changes in microbial communities and metabolic shifts [4]. One of the major obstacles for the production of hydrogen from mixed microflora is the coexistence of hydrogen consuming bacteria including methanogens, acetogens, and sulfate reducing bacteria which can obtain energy by utilizing molecular hydrogen [5]. Heat treatment [6,7], acid treatment [8], alkaline treatment [1,8] and utilization of chemical inhibitors [9,10] are some of the enrichment methods that have been used for the suppression of hydrogen consuming bacteria such as methanogens. Although short detention times have been reported to increase the productivity, in a conventional bioreactor, the biomass is easily washed out and the efficiency of substrate utilization plummets at short detention times [11]. Proliferation of other non-spore forming bacteria such as propionate bacteria and lactic acid bacteria, concomitant with high organic loading [12] retards hydrogen production due to competition for carbohydrates, as well as excretion of bacteriocins which inhibit hydrogen producers [13]. The maximum specific growth rate (μmax) for mixed culture of 0.333 h−1 [14] corresponds to the minimum solids retention time (SRTmin) of 3.0 h and thus CSTRs operated for hydrogen production are characterized by HRTs of 3–8 h. However, high dilution rates result in a marked decrease in biomass content in the reactor due to severe cell washout and system failure [15]. Although, fill and draw (fed-batch) reactors have been used for hydrogen production, they invariably suffered from inconsistent hydrogen production [16] and methane production [17]. The hydrogen yield in a sequencing batch reactor utilizing sucrose at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 82 g/L-d at 35 °C and pH 7 was 1.3 mol H2/mol hexose [18] compared to 1.15 mol H2/mol hexose observed in a CSTR at a similar OLR [19]. In order to overcome biomass washout in hydrogen reactors, decoupling of SRT from HRT in hydrogen bioreactors has been achieved primarily by using biofilms on several media including synthetic plastic media and treated anaerobic granular sludge [20], activated carbon, expanded clay and loofah sponge [6], glass beads [21] and membranes [22]. Kim et al. [23] using poly-vinyl alcohol as solid support medium for non-heat-treated sewage sludge seed, for the treatment of 20 g/L glucose at a pH 5.0 and HRT of 20 h found variable H2 production in a 30 day experiment, with approximately 4 g/L of biomass retained in the reactor. Biofilms reactors seeded with acid-shocked sewage sludge developed on activated carbon and treating 17.8 g/L sucrose at 0.5–5 h HRT, 35 °C, pH 6.7 yielded 7.4 L H2/L-h at 0.5 h HRT [24] and 1.32 L H2/L-h at 1 h HRT [6]. At higher substrate concentrations the performance declined due to competition from non-hydrogen producers but thermal treatment restored H2 production rates, suggesting spore-formers were part of the attached biofilm [4]. Problems with the development of methanogenic biofilms on the carrier media adversely impact process stability, which is critical for sustained hydrogen production. Oh et al. [25] coupled a cross-flow membrane to a CSTR operated at HRTs of 3.3 and 5 h and an SRT of 3.3–48 h on 10 g/L glucose at pH 5.5 and 26 °C, and found an optimum volumetric hydrogen production of 0.37 L H2/L-h at a 12 h SRT with the yield decreasing at an SRT of 48 h. Moreover, membranes have not shown many advantages in terms of volumetric hydrogen yield and are also prone to fouling in such a reductive environment. The up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) has been used for biological hydrogen production with varying degrees of success. Fang et al. [26] achieved a hydrogen yield of 2.2 mol/mol hexose in a 90 day test of a USAB at an OLR of 49 g/L-d of sucrose at 6 h HRT and 26 °C. The long start-up time for UASB reactors and problems with particle granulation are problematic for hydrogen production in this type of bioreactors. As depicted in Table 1 , there is no clear relationship between the hydrogen yield and the organic loading rate. In some cases higher OLRs decreased the hydrogen yield [27] whereas in some others higher OLRs increased the hydrogen yield [28]. For waste activated sludge as a seed material, it appears that increasing the OLR within 40–160 gCOD/L-d increased hydrogen yield to an optimum of 1.67 mol H2/mol glucose at an ORT of 120 gCOD/L-d [29], whereas the hydrogen yield decreased with increasing OLR for both anaerobically digested sludge [19] and soil microorganisms [27]. Hydrogen yield with digester sludge at an OLR of 45 gCOD/L-d was 1.3 mol H2/mol glucose [19] as compared with 0.92 mol H2/mol glucose with waste activated sludge [29]. Moreover, comparing the biomass concentration in the two CSTRs utilizing agricultural soil as the seed and glucose as a substrate under approximately the same OLRs, Van Ginkel and Logan [27] achieved a much higher hydrogen yield (2.2 mol/mol) at a biomass concentration of 8 g/L compared to Zhang et al. [28] who reported 0.72 mol H2/mol hexose with 0.9 g/L biomass. Oh et al. [25] achieved a hydrogen yield of 0.4 mol/mol at a biomass concentration of 2.2 g/L in a CSTR and Wu et al. [29] using a CSTR seeded with silicone-immobilized sludge realized a hydrogen yield of 1.58 mol/mol at 3.5 g/L of biomass compared to a hydrogen yield of 2.06 mol/mol achieved by Zhang et al. [28] at a similar OLR with a higher biomass concentration (4.6 g/L). It is thus clear that the higher biomass concentration in the reactors improved the hydrogen yield, which in essence shows that one of the key factors affecting the stability of hydrogen producing systems is maintaining higher biomass concentrations in the system. In addition, the low hydrogen yield and system failure were attributed to low concentrations of biomass due to washout [27]. Literature review has highlighted the importance of organic loading and maintaining active biomass in the reactor for biohydrogen production. This paper has two objectives; the first objective focuses primarily on the assessment of decoupling of SRT from HRT using a simple conventional clarification that is widely used in the anaerobic contact and activated sludge processes for wastewater treatment, while the other objective of this paper is to assess the impact of organic loading on four systems, utilizing anaerobic and waste activated sludges, as seed sludges. Additionally, this paper will compare the impact of seed sludges on hydrogen yield and microbial communities. The paper will include detailed COD mass balances and microbial characterization using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). While there is significant literature on individual systems optimization, there are few side by side comparisons that offer the opportunity for assessment of long term performance and sustainability, a widely reported concern with biohydrogen production [4]. This is particularly important in light of the various metabolic pathways and microbial shifts involved in biological hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Systems set up and operations,"2.1 Systems set up and operations Four lab-scale systems were operated at 37 °C for 65 days (Fig. 1 ). Two integrated biohydrogen reactor clarifier systems (1 and 2) [30], denoted henceforth as IBRCS-1 and IBRCS-2, comprised a continuously stirred reactor (CSTR) for biological hydrogen production (5 L working volume), followed by an uncovered gravity settler (volume 8 L) i.e. open to the atmosphere, while CSTR-1 and 2 consisted of a CSTR only with working volumes of 5 L and 2 L, respectively. Details of the operational conditions for the four systems are listed in Table 2 . In order to enrich hydrogen producing bacteria, the sludges were heat-treated at 70 °C for 30 min. The systems were monitored for total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble COD, volatile fatty acids (VFA), ethanol, lactate, glucose, volatile suspended solids (VSS), total suspended solids (TSS) and biogas composition including hydrogen, methane and nitrogen. The quantity of produced biogas was recorded daily using a wet-tip gas meter (Rebel Wet-Tip Gas Meter Company, Nashville, TN, USA)."
3,Inocula and media compositions,"2.2 Inocula and media compositions For the IBRCSs and CSTR-1, anaerobically digested sludge from the St. Marys wastewater treatment plant (St. Marys, Ontario, Canada) was used as the seed. These three systems (IBRCS-1, IBRCS-2 and CSTR-1) were seeded with 5 L of sludge and started up in a continuous mode with the feed containing glucose at different concentrations as highlighted in Table 2. It must be emphasized that there was no sludge wastage from the clarifier for systems IBRCS-1 and IBRCS-2 throughout the operation, and the values of SRTs presented in Table 2 represent the average ± standard deviation (SD) during steady state operation. It is noteworthy that the reactors operation was consistent over time and accordingly the average SRT with SD of less than 10% of the mean SRT is representative of the overall SRT during the run. As expected the clarifier effluent VSS was substantially lower than the reactor VSS and remained unchanged during the steady state operation. The feed contained sufficient inorganics (mg/L): NaHCO3, 2000–4000; CaCl2, 140; MgCl2·6H2O, 160; NH4HCO3, 600; MgSO4·7H2O, 160; urea, 500; Na2CO3, 124; KHCO3, 156; K2HPO4, 15; trace mineral solution, 500; H3PO4, 250. For CSTR-2, waste activated sludge from the Adelaide Pollution Control Plant in London, Ontario was used as the inoculum for hydrogen production. The medium contained 20 g/L glucose as the carbon source and the following inorganic salts (mg/L): NH4Cl, 2600; K2HPO4, 250; MgCl2·6H2O, 125; FeSO4·7H2O, 5.0; CoCl2·6H2O, 2.5; MnCl2·4H2O, 2.5; KI, 2.5; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.5; H3BO4, 0.5; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5;ZnCl2, 0.5. The sludge was added to achieve an initial biomass concentration of 4.2 g/L in the reactor containing the growth medium. The reactor was first operated in batch mode for 15 h, after which the reactor was shifted to the continuous mode with an HRT of 12 h. As apparent from Table 2, in order to evaluate the impact of seed sludge on hydrogen yield, the two CSTRs were operated, albeit at different OLRs. The rationale for using different OLRs is that at the same OLR of 40–45 gCOD/L-d the anaerobically digested sludge showed approximately 50% higher hydrogen yield [19] than the waste activated sludge [29], and the general trend discussed elaborately before indicated that hydrogen yield for anaerobically digested sludge as a seed decreased with OLR, and vice versa with waste activated sludge. Hence increasing the OLR in the waste activated sludge (CSTR-2) was anticipated to cause an increase in hydrogen yield to a comparable level with the waste activated sludge; minimizing the influence of OLR in the seed assessment."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The biogas composition including hydrogen, methane and nitrogen was determined by a gas chromatograph (model 310, SRI Instruments, Torrance, CA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve column (Molesieve 5A, mesh 80/100, 6 ft × 1/8 in). Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The temperatures of the column and the TCD detector were 90 and 105 °C, respectively. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Varian 8500, Varian Inc., Toronto, Canada) with a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a fused silica column (30 m × 0.32 mm). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. The temperatures of the column and detector were 110 and 250 °C, respectively. Lactic acid concentrations were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (1200 series, Agilent Technologies) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (300 mm × 7.8 mm I.D.; Bio-Rad), and a UV-detector at 210 nm. The column temperature was adjusted to 30 °C. The same instrument with a refractive index detector (RID) was used to measure the concentrations of glucose. The temperature of the RID detector was set to 35 °C. The amount of volatile suspended solids (VSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured according to standard methods [31]."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis In all four reactors, after 50 days the total genomic community DNA was extracted using the UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and after PCR amplification were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The primer set of 357FGC (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 518R (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) at the annealing temperature of 53 °C was used for PCR amplification of the variable V3 region of 16S rDNA from the purified genomic DNA. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR products was performed with a DCode universal mutation system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR products were applied directly to 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with 15–55% denaturant gradients. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 130 V at 58 °C for 5 h. The DNA templates of the bands of interest were re-amplified and the PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Sciences, MD, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The sequences of the re-amplified DNA fragments were determined by dideoxy chain termination (Sequencing Facility, John P. Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario) and compared with available sequences in the GenBank database using the BLAST program [32]."
6,Results and discussions,"Fig. 2 (a and b) shows the hydrogen production rate and yield profiles, respectively, for the four reactors throughout the 65 days of operations. All the reactors showed stable hydrogen production during the 2 months of operation. However, the coefficient of variation (calculated as standard deviation divided by the average) for the hydrogen production rate in CSTR-2 was 20% in comparison with approximately 10% variation in the other reactors. IBRCS-2 showed a drastically higher hydrogen production rate than the other systems. Comparing IBRCS-2 and CSTR-1, which were operated at the same OLR, the hydrogen production rate in IBRCS-2 gradually increased during the first 10 days of operation from 5.5 L/L-d to 11 L/L-d; while in CSTR-1 hydrogen production decreased during the first 10 days of operation and stabilized at 1.8 L/L-d. However, in the CSTR with higher organic loading rate (CSTR-2) the hydrogen production rate dropped to approximately 0.6 L/L-d after 7 days. Comparing IBRCS-1 and IBRCS-2 (see Table 3 ) under two different OLRs (6.5 and 25.7 g COD/L-d), respectively, the hydrogen yield was the same in both systems during steady state operation. The average hydrogen production rate in IBRCS-1 was 2.4 L/L-d. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , in IBRCS-1, the biomass concentration in the reactor was maintained at 1.5 g/L, while in IBRCS-2 the concentration of VSS decreased from 5.2 g/L at start-up to approximately 4.0 g/L after the 5th day and remained constant thereafter with an average value of 4.2 g/L. In CSTR-1 which was working at the same OLR of IBRCS-2 (OLR = 25.7 g COD/L-d) VSS concentration decreased to approximately 0.75 g/L after 7 days and remained stable for the rest of the study. These results substantiated the effectiveness of the gravity settler in maintaining the biomass in the system. Comparison of CSTR-1 and 2 which worked at different OLRs showed that the system with the higher organic loading rate (CSTR-2) could sustain more biomass; this result is in agreement with other researchers' findings [27]. The drop in biomass concentrations during the first days of operations observed in both CSTRs was attributed to biomass washout. Fig. 2b shows that following the initial start-up period of 7 days, the yields ranged from 2.6 to 3.1, 2.2–2.5, 1.4–2.3, 0.5–0.75 mol H2/mol glucose in IBRCS-1, IBRCS-2, CSTR-1 and CSTR-2, respectively. The steady state data as summarized in Table 3 show that the IBRCSs achieved a hydrogen yield of 2.8 mol/mol, much higher than a hydrogen yield of 1.0 and 0.5 mol/mol for CSTR-1 and CSTR-2, respectively. While the glucose conversion was complete in the IBRCSs, it was only 50% and 29% in CSTR-1 and CSTR-2, respectively. Comparison of hydrogen yields in CSTR-1 and CSTR-2 (Fig. 2b) showed that hydrogen yields in these reactors reached the maximum values of 2.3 and 0.75 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively, after approximately 3 days. However, in both CSTRs the hydrogen yield dropped afterward and stabilized at average values of 1.0 ± 0.1 and 0.5 ± 0.1 mol H2/mol glucose for CSTR-1 and CSTR-2, respectively, after 10 days of continuous operation. It is notable that the steady state hydrogen yield with waste activated sludge was half of that with anaerobically digested sludge, thus suggesting that waste activated sludge diversity did not enhance biohydrogen production. The COD mass balance for the four systems is shown in Table 4 , computed considering the measured influent and effluent CODs, and the equivalent CODs for both gas and biomass. The closure of COD balances at 97–109% validates the reliability of the data. Using the stoichiometric yield of 4 and 2 mol H2/mol glucose from Eqs. (1 and 2), and according to the measured concentrations of acetate and butyrate, the contribution of the two pathways was estimated. (1) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 (2) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 In IBRCS-1, 65% and 35% of the hydrogen produced were through the acetate and butyrate pathways, respectively. The main liquid products in IBRCS-2 were acetate and butyrate at concentrations of 2494 mg/L and 1594 mg/L respectively, with approximately 68% and 32% of the hydrogen yield through the acetate and butyrate pathways, respectively. In CSTR-1, the acetate and butyrate concentrations were 650 mg/L and 1366 mg/L, respectively, and both acetate and butyrate pathways equally contributed to hydrogen production at 50% each. Furthermore, in CSTR-2 lactate was detected at an average concentration of 460 mg/L, while acetate and butyrate concentrations were much lower than the other systems The hydrogen yield followed the same pattern of CSTR-1 with 50/50% through the acetate/butyrate pathways. Fig. 4 shows the biomass yields for the four systems, calculated as the slope of the cumulative biomass produced versus the cumulative glucose converted. It should be noted that biomass production incorporated both the temporal changes in bioreactor mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and the solids leaving the clarifier liquid effluent for IBRCS-1 and IBRCS-2, and solids leaving the bioreactor in CSTR-1 and 2. The observed biomass yields in IBRCS-1 and IBRCS-2 of 0.12 and 0.09 g VSS/g glucose were substantially lower than the CSTRs of 0.19–0.29 g VSS/g glucose. Although the observed yield is impacted by SRTs, the statistically significant differences between the IBRCSs and CSTRs at the 95% confidence level cannot be rationalized only on the basis of SRT. Fig. 5 shows the inverse relationship between the biomass and hydrogen yields which emphatically demonstrates that the higher biomass yield is attributed to different microorganisms other than hydrogen producers. The IBRCS as a new configuration proved to be selectively enriching the hydrogen producers and minimizing the growth of other competitors that decrease the hydrogen yield. Using Eq. (3) and the biomass yield reported in the literature for hydrogen producers of 0.1 g VSS/g glucose [11], it was estimated that the non-hydrogen producing bacteria constituted 12.5%, 0%, 40%, and 60% of the measured bioreactor VSS in IBRCS-1, IBRCS-2, CSTR-1, and CSTR-2, respectively. (3) X v = X a + X i = X HP + X nHP + X i = θ c Y tHP OLR η + X nHP + X i where X v is the total biomass, X a is the active microbial population in the reactor which in this case consisted of the biomass of hydrogen producers (X HP) and biomass of non-hydrogen producers (X nHP), X i is the inert remains of microorganisms in the reactor, θc is the solid retention time, Y tHP is the true yield of hydrogen producers, OLR is the organic loading rate and η is the substrate conversion efficiency. The higher content of non-hydrogen producing bacteria in CSTR-2 with waste activated sludge as the seed, relative to CSTR-1 (anaerobically digested sludge as the seed), rationalizes both the higher biomass yield and the lower hydrogen yield for the waste activated sludge. The DGGE profiles of the 16S rDNA gene fragments in the four continuous reactors are illustrated in Fig. 6 . Table 5 shows the results of the sequence affiliation. The number of bands detected in IBRCS-2 which was operating at an OLR of 25.7 gCOD/L-d was more than those detected in IBRCS-1 at an OLR of 6.5 gCOD/L-d. The increase in the number of bands in CSTR-2 in comparison with CSTR-1 indicated the more diverse microflora in CSTR-2. The comparison of DGGE profile of IBRCS-2 and CSTR-1 operated at the same organic loading rates shows different microbial community structures in these reactors. Considering the higher yield of hydrogen production in IBRCS-2 and the different microbial community, it appears that the gravity settler in the IBRCSs allowed for selective enrichment of high-hydrogen producing species. Klebsiella pneumonia (bands 1, 2 and 10) which has been observed in all of the reactors is a facultative anaerobic bacterium that is frequently used for hydrogen production as a pure culture [33,34] or detected as one of the active microorganisms in mixed cultures of hydrogen production systems [35]. Band 3 in CSTR-2 is also a Klebsiella sp. This band has not been observed in the other reactors. The presence of more facultative anaerobes in CSTR-2 may be due to using activated sludge as the microbial seed in this reactor. Clostridium pasteurianum (band 6) which is a hydrogen producer with a yield of 1.5 mol glucose/mol hydrogen [36] was detected in IBRCS-2 and CSTR-1. Clostridium acetobutyricum (band 7) was observed only in IBRCS-2. This bacterium is one of the frequently reported species in hydrogen producing reactors [37,38]. Clostridium mesophilum (band 8) was observed only in CSTR-2. Although most of the Clostridium species have the ability of hydrogen production there is no specific report of hydrogen production by C. mesophilum. CSTR-2 which exhibited the lowest hydrogen yield among other reactors showed the most diverse DGGE profile. Lactobacillus fermentum (bands 4 and 9) and Pseudomonas veronii (band 5) are two non-hydrogen producers which were present only in CSTR-2 and could potentially use glucose for the production of other metabolites rather than hydrogen and decrease the hydrogen yield in this reactor. The lactic acid production in CSTR-2 (Table 4) can be attributed to the presence of lactic acid bacteria L. fermentum. This finding is in agreement with Oh et al. [12] who reported that the concentration and/or the activities of lactate forming bacteria increase as organic loading increases. However, these researchers did not analyze the microbial culture. Comparing CSTR-1 and CSTR-2, it is apparent that the waste activated sludge, though more microbially diverse than anaerobically digested sludge, is not advantageous for biohydrogen production due to the presence of non-hydrogen producers such as Lactobacillus species. It has been reported that lactic acid bacteria reduce hydrogen production through the inhibition of hydrogen producers [13]. Resistance of pre-existing lactic acid bacteria after heat treatment at 65 °C and their appearance after the third consecutive batch in a repeated batch experiment using waste activated sludge have been reported in our previous work [39]."
7,Conclusion,"The decoupling of SRT from HRT in biohydrogen production systems, evaluated in this work, validated the promise of using a gravity settler after a CSTR to maintain high biomass retention in the system and decrease biomass washout, thus improving hydrogen yield and long term sustainability of hydrogen production. Using a gravity settler after a CSTR drastically increased the hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield from 1.8 to 9.6 L/L/d and from 1 to 2.8 mol/mol glucose, respectively. The diversity of waste activated sludge does not provide any advantage to biohydrogen production relative to anaerobically digested sludge as reflected by 50% lower hydrogen yield and 50% higher biomass yield. In addition, the IBRCSs were capable of producing hydrogen at the same yield with approximately full conversion of glucose at two different OLRs in the range of 6.5–25.7 gCOD/L-d. Although further work is needed to optimize the IBRCS, and evaluate the impact of higher OLRs on the performance of the system, the inverse relationship between hydrogen and biomass yields observed in this study shows that the higher biomass yield is attributed to the presence of non-hydrogen producing biomass, and the widely reported failure of biohydrogen reactors due to biomass washout corroborates the need for decoupling of SRT from HRT in order to maximize biohydrogen production."
