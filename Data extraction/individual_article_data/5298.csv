0,Introduction,"Boron compounds (reagents) have become an important part of today's fine chemical industry for the preparation of highly complex functionalized molecules. Commercially available boron compounds are widely utilized in pharmaceutical polymer and electronics manufacturing [1]. Boron complexes are versatile compounds that are commonly used as regio-, chemo-, and stereoselective reducing agents of a variety of group functionalities such as aldehydes, ketones, amides, and olefins [2]. Over the past decades, environmentally friendly tri and tetracoordinate boron compounds have attracted considerable attention because of their low cytotoxicity, electronic structure, easy preparation, low cost, and air-stable properties [3]. Furthermore, boron and related compounds have important applications in many fields such as catalysis; pharmacology; toxicology; agriculture; and textile, glass, ceramic, cosmetic, energy, and construction industries, as well as in communication tool manufacturing and detergent production [4]. In contrast to tetracoordinate boron compounds, tricoordinate dioxaborinanes formed from the catechol-type ligands and boronic acid interactions have an empty p-orbital, which makes them strong electrophiles and Lewis acids, and the two covalent BO bonds make the structure stable in air. Because of their unique features, tricoordinate dioxaborinanes are one of the most widely studied groups [5–7]. Two types of hydrogenation methods, namely the transfer hydrogenation and direct hydrogenation, have been widely used. Because of the absence of molecular hydrogen, the transfer hydrogenation method, in which formic acid and its salts or secondary alcohols have been used as hydrogen sources, is more attractive and safer than direct the hydrogenation method [8–10]. Nowadays, several transition metals such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh and Ru are often used as catalysts in transfer hydrogenation with high activity [11–13]. However, these metals are usually not preferred for the transfer hydrogenation, because they are expensive and cause environmental pollution. Instead of them, the development of an effective and cheaper catalytst for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones is one of the main targets for the scientists [1,2]. Boron in its tricoordinate dioxaborinane molecules is mainly interesting because it is considerably more effective and stable than tetracoordinate boron complexes for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones as catalysts [1,2]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the use of tricoordinate dioxaborinane derivatives in the transfer hydrogenation. In view of the promising results, tricoordinate dioxaborinane derivatives were shown to be efficient homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts toward various substrates, and these catalysts would be a valuable material for the transfer hydrogenation. In this study, various techniques such as NMR (1H, 13C, and 11B), FT-IR, UV–vis, LC-MS spectroscopy, and melting point and elemental analyses were used to characterize these compounds."
1,Experimental,The information about the chemicals and devices used in this study is given in the supplementary information. The synthesis and spectroscopic results are also given as supplementary information for the new catechol-type ligands (L 1 -L 5 ) and their tricoordinate dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] compounds.
2,Results and discussion,"The dark brown catechol-type ligands (L 1 -L 5 ) were prepared in EtOH with a yield in the range 83–78%, as shown in Scheme 1 . The dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] compounds were obtained in toluene and DMF at reflux temperature over 8 h with a yield up to 78% (Scheme 2 )."
3,Characterization of the catechol-type ligands and their dioxaborinane derivatives,"3.1 Characterization of the catechol-type ligands and their dioxaborinane derivatives The bands in the range 3553–2329 cm−1 were due to the stretching vibrations of intermolecular H-bond υ(OH…OH) in 1,2-dihydroxy groups of catechol-type ligands, which disappeared in the FT-IR spectra of dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] complexes (Fig. S1–S3), as expected. These results show the deprotonation of the 1,2-dihydroxy moiety owing to the coordination and confirm the formation of the dioxaborinane derivatives (Fig. S1–S3). In addition, the bands at 1650–1641 cm−1 for catechol-type ligands and at 1659–1644 cm−1 for dioxaborinane derivatives were due to the stretching vibrations of azomethine groups (HCN) [14]. Furthermore, compared to the catechol-type ligands, the stretching peak of azomethine groups υ(HCN) of dioxaborinanes, [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )], exhibited a higher frequency shift, the supporting formation of the tricoordinate dioxaborinanes. New characteristics peaks appeared at 1194–1189 cm−1 υ(BO), 893–890 cm−1 υ(BC), and 484–480 cm−1 υ(FeC) for [B 1 (L 1–5 )] complexes and at 1164–1161 cm−1 υ(BO) and 899–896 cm−1 υ(BC) for [B 2 (L 1–5 )] complexes [15,16]. The NMR spectra of the ligands and their dioxaborinane derivatives are given in the Supporting Information (Fig. S4–S18). The resonances of azomethine (CHN) region were observed in the range 8.41–8.29 ppm [17] as singlet, and this region showed little variation between catechol-type ligands. The azomethine (CHN) signals of [B 1 (L 1–5 )] complexes were shifted to lower frequencies (in the range δ = 8.23–7.95 ppm) with respect to the ligands, whereas the proton signals of the azomethine groups in [B 2 (L 1–5 )] complexes (in the range δ = 8.73–8.42 ppm) significantly shifted to the high field compared to the ligands because of the nature of ferrocene or 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl moiety. The peaks of 1, 2-dihydroxy proton (OH) region of ligands (L 1 –L 5 ) were observed in the range 8.04–7.96 ppm as singlet or doublets, and the disappearance of the OH signals in the dioxaborinane compounds indicates the binding of the boron atoms to the two oxygen atoms. The ferrocene region could show from three to four signals (around δ = 4.45–4.08 ppm) that correspond to the non-substituted cyclopentadiene of [B 1 (L 1–5 )] complexes [18], as expected. When the 13C NMR was examined (Fig. S4–S18), the chemical shifts observed in the range δ = 168.23–162.18 ppm were assigned to azomethine (HCN) carbons and those in the range δ = 162.43–105.58 ppm were assigned to aromatic (ArCH) carbons. In addition, the ferrocene unit carbon signals were observed in the range 73.35–67.68 ppm [18], which confirms that the two cyclopentadiene rings containing ferrocene unit is connected to the boron center in the ferrocene-based [B 1 (L 1–5 )] compounds. In the 13C NMR spectra of all compounds, other characteristic resonances appeared in the range 66.18–17.47 ppm, which provides another evidence for the formation of all compounds. In the 11B NMR spectra of dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] derivatives, the boron resonances observed in the range δ = 14.12–14.78 ppm for the [B 1 (L 1–5 )] complexes and in the range δ = 9.02–10.04 ppm for the [B 2 (L 1–5 )] complexes due to the same chemical environment for the boron atoms of each compound (Fig. S19-S22), which confirms the formation of tricoordinate dioxaborinane compounds. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the ligands (L 1 –L 5 ) and their dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] derivatives were evaluated in dilute C2H5OH and DMF (2.10−5–2.10−7 M) at room temperature (Fig. S23–S26). In the absorption spectra of the ligands (L 1 –L 5 ) and their dioxaborinane derivatives [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )], similar absorbance wavelengths were observed because of the π → π* or n → π* electronic transitions arising from the donor atoms and aromatic rings [19]. These obvious absorption bands were observed in the range 218–506 and 264–501 nm in C2H5OH and DMF, respectively. Further confirmation of the formation of the catechol-type ligands (L 1 -L 5 ) and their dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] compounds was also provided by LC-MS spectroscopy (Fig. S27–S32). Their LC-MS calculated and obtained spectral results showed the expected molecular and fragmentation ions, with appropriate isotope distribution (Fig. S23–S28)."
4,Catalytic properties,"3.2 Catalytic properties We preferred to examine the transfer hydrogenation of simple ketones by using a 2-propanol/base system in the presence of the tricoordinate dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] or [B 2 (L 1–5 )] molecules as catalysts. In a preliminary study, the ferrocene-based [B 1 (L 1–5 )] or 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-based [B 2 (L 1–5 )] dioxaborinane compounds were tested as precursors for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone and the results are summarized in Table 1 . A typical procedure using acetophenone as substrate was performed as follows. First, 0.01 mmol of dioxaborinane catalysts and 1.0 mmol of acetophenone were added to a solution of KOH in 2-propanol (0.05 mmol of KOH in 10 mL 2-propanol) and refluxed at 82 °C, the reaction being monitored by GC spectroscopy. At room temperature, the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone occurred very slowly, with low conversion (up to 10%, 96 h) in the reactions. Additionally, as can be inferred from the catalytic tests, the presence of base is necessary to observe appreciable conversions. The base facilitateds the formation of boron alkoxide by extracting the proton of the alcohol, and subsequently, the alkoxide undergoes β-elimination to give boron hydride, which is an active species in this reaction. In our study, the use of the base alone and the absence of tricoordinate dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] or [B 2 (L 1–5 )] catalysts was not effective for the transfer hydrogenation reaction, and the conversions are very low (>3%), which conrims the boron catalysts play a key role in catalyzing this reaction. In addition, the choice of base, such as KOH or NaOH, had a remarkable influence on the conversion, and with a catalyst/KOH ratio of 1/5, the dioxaborinane compounds were very active leading to a quantitative transformation of the acetophenone (Table 1, entries 11–14,[d]). Reduction of acetophenone into 1-phenylethanol could be achieved in high yields by increasing the temperature up to 82 °C (Table 1, entries 1–10). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the reactivities of catalytic systems the dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] catalysts were different. These results indicate that the structure difference of the dioxaborinane compounds is a crucial factor for the acceleration of the reaction. Therefore, from the results, the dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] were effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of acetophenone, producing products with up to 99% conversion. In general, the ferrocene-based [B 1 (L 1–5 )] catalysts showed a much higher activity than other tricoordinate dioxaborinane catalysts (Table 1). The higher catalytic activities (electron-rich ferrocene moiety) could be explained by the nature of the ligands, which can generate an open coordination site at boron more easily. It thus appears that the nature of the ligands could also play a crucial role in the transfer hydrogenation reactions. These results obviously indicate that the catalysts have ferrocene moiety that can possibly stabilize a catalytic transition state when compared with other catalysts. Furthermore, the observation that the electron-rich ferrocene ligands leading to a more active catalyst is indeed interesting because one would expect that an electron-withdrawing ligand would increase the Lewis acidity of the boron center. Furthermore, it was also observed that the catalytic activities in the studied hydrogen transfer reactions were generally much higher for the catalysts having pyridine moiety, [B 1 (L 4 )] and [B 2 (L 4 )] than for the dioxaborinane catalysts. In particular, the ferrocene-based and pyridine-containing [B 1 (L 4 )] compound acted as a good catalyst giving a good conversion of the corresponding alcohols up to 99% (TOF ≤ 396 h−1). These results also show that the conversion rate of the substrate can also be affected by the electronic factors and the steric factors of the substituents on the ligand-attached dioxaborinane derivatives. Moreover, the conversions gradually decreased with the increase in mole ratios of [acetophenone]/[Cat] from 250/1 to 500/1 or 1000/1, and also the reaction time was increase (Table 2 , entries 1–6). Attributable to their efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone, dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 4 )] and [B 2 (L 4 )] catalysts were further investigated in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives to be converted into the corresponding secondary alcohols under the optimal conditions as shown in Table 1S. Because the catalytic activities in the studied hydrogen transfer reactions were generally much higher for the dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 4 )] and [B 2 (L 4 )] catalysts than those for the other compounds, only these two catalysts were extensively investigated with acetophenone derivatives. The verification of the results indicates clearly that among all the tested dioxaborinane compounds, the best yield was achieved in the reduction of acetophenone derivatives when dioxaborinane compound that has not only ferrocene moiety but also pyridine group, [B 1 (L 4 )], was used as the catalyst precursor. The results showed that a range of acetophenone derivatives can be hydrogenated with high conversions. As already stated, the electronic properties (the nature and position) of the substituents on the phenyl ring of the ketone affected the changes in the reduction rate. As shown in Table 1S, the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents to the ortho-, meta-, or para positions of the aryl ring of the ketone decreased the electron density of the CO bond so that the activity was improved giving rise to easier hydrogenation [20,21]. Thus, the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents such as F- or NO2- resulted in an improved activity with a good yield (Table 1S, entries 1–8). On the contrary, the introduction of an electron-donating group such as methoxy group decelerated the reaction regardless of the position of substitution (Table 1S, entries 9–17). Overall, the catalytic efficiency attained a very high level in the reduction of aromatic ketones and compared with the recently discovered similar catalyst systems [22,23]. We carried out further experiments to study the influence of bulkiness of the alkyl groups on the catalytic activity and selectivity (Table 2S, entries 1–8), and the results are presented in Table 2S. A variety of simple aryl alkyl ketones were transformed to their corresponding secondary alcohols. It was observed that the activity was significantly dependent on the steric hindrance of the alkyl group [24–28]. The reactivity gradually reduced with the increase in the bulkiness of the alkyl groups [29,30]. For example, the hydrogenations of isopropyl phenyl ketone could be achieved approximately in 2 and 5 h by dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 4 )] and [B 2 (L 4 )] catalysts, respectively. Consequently, one can easily conclude that the catalytic activity of dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 4 )] complex was generally much higher in the studied hydrogen transfer reactions than that of dioxaborinane [B 2 (L 4 )] compound. Because of their efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives, complexes [B 1 (L 4 )] and [B 2 (L 4 )] were further investigated in the transfer hydrogenation of a variety of ketones to be converted to the corresponding alcohols under the optimization conditions. Table 3S shows several examples for the asymmetric reductions performed using this method. The reaction of methyl/alkyl and methyl/aryl ketones gave an acceptable chemical yield of their corresponding products. Thus, a variety of simple alkyl/alkyl and aryl/alkyl ketones were transformed to their corresponding secondary alcohols and it was found that the activities were highly dependent on the structure of the alkyl or alkyl group. Reaction of ketones possessing a bulky alkyl substituent proceeded rather sluggish and decreased the conversion rate. When the size of the alkyl group increased, the activity decreased. In addition, as shown in Table 3S, the highest activity was observed with 1-naphtyl methyl ketone (up to 99% conversion, TOF: 392). Furthermore, the hydrogenation of the ketones having the cyclohexyl group was very slow (Table 3S, entries 1–16)."
5,Conclusion,"In summary, the catechol-type ligands and their dioxaborinane derivatives obtained in this work were characterized by NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C and 11B), FT-IR spectroscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, LC-MS spectroscopy, and melting point and elemental analyses. Then, the dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 1–5 )] and [B 2 (L 1–5 )] compounds were evaluated for the transfer hydrogenation of the reduction of ketones as catalysts. The catalytic activities in the studied hydrogen transfer reactions were generally much higher for the dioxaborinane [B 1 (L 4 )] and [B 2 (L 4 )] catalysts than those for the other compounds. However, the catalytic results indicate that among all the tested dioxaborinane compounds, the best yield was achieved in the reduction of acetophenone derivatives when [B 1 (L 4 )] was used as the catalyst precursor, which has not only ferrocene moiety but also pyridine group. Furthermore, the simplicity and efficiency clearly make it an excellent choice of catalyst for the practical preparation of high-value alcohols by the catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones."
