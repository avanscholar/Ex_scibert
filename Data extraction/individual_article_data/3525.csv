0,Introduction,"Visible light-driven photocatalysts that could produce hydrogen from water splitting under solar light have been actively sought [1–5]. CdS has an ideal band gap energy (2.4eV) and band positions that can drive both oxidation and reduction of water under visible light irradiation. Yet, pure CdS is usually not very active in hydrogen production, and subject to photo-corrosion [6]. In attempt to improve the photo-activity and photo-stability, CdS has been combined with other materials such as ZnO, TiO2 and LaMnO3 or intercalated into layered compounds [7–10]. We have found that the fabrication method of these composite photocatalysts is critical for their performance. Usually, nanosized CdS and TiO2 particles are combined to obtain the composite in order to maximize the surface areas. Here, we report a new method of fabricating a highly efficient composite photocatalyst, i.e., CdS/TiO2 nano-bulk composite (NBC) photocatalyst consisting of bulky CdS with a high crystallinity decorated with nanosized TiO2 particles. This configuration of the composite photocatalyst exhibited an unprecedented high rate of hydrogen production under visible light (λ ⩾420nm) from water containing sulfide and sulfite as sacrificial reagents. As a practical application of this highly active catalyst, the simultaneous hydrogen production and decomposition of H2S was performed. Our CdS/TiO2 NBC photocatalyst showed high rates of hydrogen production from H2S dissolved in alkaline water. In both cases of hydrogen production from water and decomposition of H2S, the catalyst was much more active than other configurations of the composite, i.e., nano-CdS/bulk-TiO2 or nano-CdS/nano-TiO2 coprecipitates [11,12]."
1,Experimental,"To prepare CdS photocatalyst, a stoichiometric amount of Na2S aqueous solution was added drop-by-drop to Cd(NO3)2 dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. Precipitated powder was filtered, dried, and then calcined at 1073K for 1h under He flow to increase the crystallinity of CdS. To fabricate CdS(bulk)/TiO2 NBC photocatalyst, the bulky CdS catalyst was stirred in isopropyl alcohol and titanium isopropoxide (in a mole ratio of Ti to CdS of 4) and H2O were added drop-by-drop. The prepared composite powder was filtered, dried, and calcined at 673K for 2h under air flow to increase the crystallinity of TiO2. For comparison, the opposite configuration of nano-CdS decorating bulk TiO2 was also prepared. Thus, on bulk TiO2 calcined at 873K, CdS was precipitated from Na2S and Cd(NO3)2 and calcined at 673K for 2h under air flow. The crystalline phases of the products were determined by X-ray diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF). The optical properties were analyzed by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). Morphologies of photocatalysts were investigated by transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010F, Field Emission Electron Microscope). The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature under normal pressure in a closed circulation system using a Hg-arc lamp (500W) equipped with UV cut off filter (λ ⩾420nm). Before reaction, 1wt% of Pt was deposited on photocatalysts by photodeposition method under visible light (λ ⩾420nm). TEM examination after Pt deposition showed that Pt particles were deposited randomly on both CdS and TiO2. The reaction was performed with 0.1g of photocatalyst in 100mL aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3. Hydrogen production from H2S solutions was investigated under the same conditions, but without the sacrificial reagents. The reaction solutions were prepared by dissolving H2S up to saturation in NaOH solution (0, 0.1, and 1M). The evolved amounts of H2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier)."
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples. The crystallinity of CdS in CdS(bulk)/TiO2 NBC photocatalyst was as good as the single phase CdS calcined at 1073K, considering its concentration (30wt%) in the composite. The pure CdS showed well-developed hexagonal phase. The TiO2 phase was anatase both in single and NBC photocatalysts. In the configuration of CdS/TiO2(bulk), the bulky TiO2 was well-developed anatase, but CdS was in pure cubic phase. The morphology of CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts was observed by TEM as shown in Fig. 1. In CdS(bulk)/TiO2, CdS particles of ca. 1–2μm was decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles of ca. 10–20nm. In CdS/TiO2(bulk), the morphology is similar, but now 50–100nm TiO2 was decorated with 20nm CdS. The diffuse reflection spectra for these catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The bulky CdS photocatalyst showed a sharp edge at 570nm, while that of TiO2 was observed at 390nm. The spectra of both CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts showed a combination of these two spectra, although CdS in composite photocatalysts showed a blue-shift of the main absorbance edge to 550nm. This is in agreement with the previous report by Kisch et al. that the band gap of CdS employed in composite photocatalyst is shifted by an electronic semiconductor-support interaction (SEMSI) [13,14]. The rate of hydrogen production was measured from an aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (λ ⩾420nm). The time courses of hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 3 . As previously reported [15], there was an apparent induction period of 1–2h before the steady state hydrogen evolution rates of bulky CdS and CdS/TiO2(bulk) photocatalysts were established. Yet, CdS(bulk)/TiO2 photocatalyst did not show such an induction period, and showed the highest rate of hydrogen production. The surface sulfur species was analyzed by XPS before photoreaction (not shown here). The S2p peaks indicated that CdS calcined at 1073K contained SO 4 2 - as an impurity, whereas CdS(bulk)/TiO2 contained only sulfide (S2−) species. This surface oxidation may be responsible for the induction period for the single-component CdS photocatalysts. In CdS(bulk)/TiO2 catalyst, the surface oxidation of CdS appears to be suppressed due to protection by TiO2 nanoparticles decorating the bulk CdS surface. The average rates of hydrogen evolution during the first 5h are compared in Table 1 together with other physical properties. The pure CdS calcined at 1073K showed much higher activity than CdS calcined at 673K, despite of its much reduced surface area. High temperature treatment induces the formation of the hexagonal wurtzite phase (Fig. 1), which is known to be the more active phase than the low-temperature, cubic zinc blend phase [16]. In addition, heat treatment could heal surface defects in the crystallites, which are responsible for the energy-wasteful photoelectron-hole recombination. Now, the CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst shows even higher photocatalytic activity (by a factor of ca. 4.4) than that of active single phase CdS photocatalyst having similar crystallinity. The composite catalyst also showed the highest surface area although its correlation with photocatalytic activity is not apparent as in the case of two CdS samples. As inferred in other composite photocatalysts [17,18], the superior activity of the composite photocatalyst is considered to be due to faster charge separation compared to CdS alone upon initial light absorption, caused by fast diffusion of photoelectrons generated in bulky CdS toward surrounding TiO2 nanoparticles as schematically represented in Fig. 4 . However, the configuration containing highly-crystalline, hexagonal-phase CdS is essential for high photocatalytic activity since the reverse configuration of CdS/TiO2(bulk) containing nanosized CdS particles of the cubic phase are far less active (by a factor of 325!). It is also much more active than nano-CdS/nano-TiO2 coprecipitates reported in the literature [19,20]. It is remarkable that the fabrication method of the composite has such a dramatic effect despite the composition was almost the same. To the best of our knowledge, the rate of hydrogen evolution over CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst represents one of the highest values ever reported under similar reaction conditions for any visible light active photocatalysts. The activity for CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst for hydrogen production is at least an-order-of-magnitude higher than other CdS-containing composite systems made mostly of CdS nanoparticles [21–25]. Only complicated solid solution of ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 showed the higher activity [26]. Hydrogen production from water in the presence of sacrificial reagents is the standard method of evaluating the activity of metal sulfide photocatalysts, yet the method itself has a limited practical value because the sacrificial reagents are irreversibly consumed. However, the high hydrogen production activity over our CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst could be exploited for the practical process of simultaneous hydrogen production and H2S removal, e.g., the treatment of Claus plant tail-gas stream or vents of hydrodesulfurization plants [27–30]. In H2S scrubbers used in such industry, alkaline water is commonly employed for effective H2S scrubbing by an acid–base reaction (1) showed below. Note that the soluble alkali metal sulfides are common sacrificial reagents for hydrogen production with metal sulfide photocatalysts and are also employed to improve the activity and stability of the sulfide photocatalysts. They are formed in situ here when H2S is scrubbed by alkaline water. The following reactions are known to occur during photocatalytic H2S cleavage: (1) H 2 S + 2 OH - → S 2 - + 2 H 2 O (2) 2 e - + 2 H 2 O → H 2 + 2 OH - (3) S 2 - → S 0 + 2 e - The net reaction is H2S cleavage to H2 and S0, but water also contributes to the hydrogen production through the reaction (2). Thus, we dissolved H2S in pure water and NaOH solution. Shown in Fig. 5 are the results of photocatalytic hydrogen production from various electrolyte solutions over CdS(bulk)/TiO2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation (λ ⩾420nm for all catalysts). High rates of hydrogen evolution were observed from H2S electrolyte dissolved in NaOH. It should be noted that the initial rates of hydrogen production from H2S/0.1M NaOH/H2O and H2O/0.1M Na2S/0.02M Na2SO3 are very similar. The latter is the typical condition of water splitting experiments over sulfide photocatalysts with Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents. As mentioned, sulfide ion is formed stoichiometrically in situ by reaction between H2S and NaOH. In contrast, H2S dissolved in pure water showed an extremely low photoactivity. When H2S is bubbled into pure water, simple dissolution of H2S takes place instead of the chemical reaction observed when an alkali is present. The solubility in water is as high as ca. 0.1M (at 298K), roughly equal to titrated alkaline solution. But the dissociation of H2S is severely limited as indicated by the pK value of 11.96 at 291K for the reaction of HS− ⇆H+ +S2−. Thus, the low photocatalytic activity of H2S dissolved in pure water may originate from the limited availability of sulfide ions."
3,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we report that the fabrication of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 NBC photocatalyst based on crystalline CdS decorated with TiO2 nano-particles is a successful strategy to develop a highly active photocatalyst for hydrogen production from water under visible light irradiation. This NBC structure results in an efficient charge separation, caused by fast diffusion of photoelectrons generated from bulky CdS toward surrounding TiO2 nanoparticles, leading to high photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production. This active composite photocatalyst could be applied for practical processes of simultaneous hydrogen production and H2S removal in the treatment of Claus plant tail gas streams or vents of hydrodesulfurization plants."
