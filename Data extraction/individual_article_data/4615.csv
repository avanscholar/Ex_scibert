0,Introduction,"With the increasing energy demand and continuous consumption of fossil energy, the development of sustainable energy has attracted tremendous attention in the energy storage and conversion [1]. It is imperative for us to find renewable energy substitutes for traditional fossil energy to solve the coming energy crisis. Among the renewable energies, hydrogen energy as a secondary energy has many advantages like high energy density, high combustion efficiency and zero emission [2–6], which makes it stand out from the other energy sources. Particularly, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as the half reaction of water splitting offers a simple and direct method to produce hydrogen energy [7,8]. Noble metal based materials are regarded as ideal electrocatalysts for HER due to low overpotential and excellent stability in the process of water splitting [9]. However, such expensive catalysts greatly limit the development and scale-up application of new energy sources in industry. Therefore, seeking cheap and efficient non-noble metal based electrocatalysts for HER become the core issue of industrial hydrogen production. Over the past few years, noble metal-free catalysts have been widely studied, including metal phosphates [10], metal sulfides [11,12], metal selenides [13], metal nitrides [14], carbides [15,16] and so on [17]. In recent years, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) attract a lot of attention due to high-efficiency and excellent stability in HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [18–20]. The strong electronegativity of P atom in TMPs attracts electrons from the metal atoms. The negative charged P atom can capture protons during the process of HER, which optimizes the binding energy between metal and active H atoms and improve the HER performance [21–23]. Theoretically, the amount of H2 produced by HER is twice that of O2 produced by OER in water splitting [24], thus, high requirements of the mechanical stability and gas diffusion rate for the HER working electrode. Self-supporting electrode materials on conductive substrate not only avoid the use of binder, but also reduce the loss caused by poor interface contact, which provide a reliable electrode structure. Prussian blue analogues (PBA), as a kind of classic coordination polymers, have been extensively studied in many fields such as magnetics [25], electronics [26] and catalysis [27] for its abundant catalytic sites, easy preparation and cheap precursors. Particularly, their derived materials have been widely used in many fields of electrocatalysis, such as OER, HER, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and so on [28–31]. However, powder electrocatalysts usually need drop-casting onto the current collector (e.g. glassy carbon electrode) with the assistance of polymeric binder, which greatly decreases the activity of catalytic sites and limits the electrocatalytic performance. As thin film catalysts expose more active sites and reduce the resistance of charge transfer compare to the powder materials, recently the PBA derived thin films have been studied to improve the electrochemical performance. Particularly, the fabrication method of high quality porous coordination polymers (or metal organic frameworks, MOFs) thin films by liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) layer-by-layer (LBL) method (surface coordinated MOF thin films, SURMOF) has attracted extensive attention of researchers in electrocatalytic applications [32–35]. In this method, the functionalized substrate is alternately immersed in the solution of metal ions (or metal clusters) and organic bridging ligands. After each immersion cycle, uncoordinated precursor is removed with the solvent and the thickness of the film controlled by the growth cycles. Finally, uniform and homogeneous SURMOF is obtained on modified substrate. Based on the advantages above, PBA analogues thin film prepared by LPE LBL method has a promising application in the fields of photo/electric devices and electrocatalysis. In this work, NiFe-PBA film is assembled on the modified nickel foam (NF) substrate by LPE LBL method [36]. After phosphatizing with PH3 produced by sodium hypophosphite, the NiFe-PBA film is in-situ transformed to well-aligned bimetallic phosphide NiFeP film [37] (Fig. 1 ). The electrocatalytic performance imply that the overpotential of NiFeP film is only 99 ​mV at the current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2 and it can maintain the performance for over 30 ​h at 100 ​mA ​cm−2, which shows the excellent HER performance and durable stability of NiFeP film."

3,Pre-treatment and modification of nickel foam (NF),"2.2 Pre-treatment and modification of nickel foam (NF) After the NF cleaned ultrasonically with ethanol, acetone, dilute hydrochloric acid and distilled water alternately to remove impurities thoroughly, the surface of NF was dried by N2 purging, then modified in the alkaline piranha solution at 80 ​°C in a constant temperature water bath for 40 ​min, which could modify with a layer of hydroxyl groups which is convenient for coordination. The piranha solution was composed of 2 ​mM KOH and 30% hydrogen peroxide (3:1, v/v). Afterwards, the sample was washed with distilled water for several times and dried with N2."
4,Preparation of NiFe-PBA film,"2.3 Preparation of NiFe-PBA film First, the NiFe-PBA film was synthesized on the NF substrate by mechanical immersion layer by layer method. As the soaking steps were controlled by mechanical program, which ensured the uniformity and the repeatability of the film. The immersion solutions were 2 ​mM nickel acetate and 2 ​mM potassium ferricyanide aqueous solution. The immersion was carried out at 60 ​°C constant temperature water bath and the specific procedures were as follows: (a) Immerse the modified NF substrate in 2 ​mM nickel acetate solution for 30 ​min. (b) Took out the sample and washed with distilled water for 1 ​min. (c) Immersed the sample in 2 ​mM potassium ferricyanide solution for 30 ​min. (d) Took out the sample and washed with distilled water for 1 ​min. (e) Repeated the steps above for 10 times."
5,Preparation of NiFeP film,"2.4 Preparation of NiFeP film After immersing, took out the substrate and washed with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol for several times, then dry in 80 ​°C oven for 6 ​h. The prepared NiFe-PBA film and 200 ​mg NaH2PO2 was put into crucible separately and phosphating in the tube furnace protected by nitrogen atmosphere. As the temperature rised to 350 ​°C with the rate of 2 ​°C min−1, sodium hypophosphite would decompose to produce PH3, 2NaH2PO2 ​= ​Na2HPO4+PH3↑ and the NiFe-PBA film reacted with PH3 for 2 ​h, then cool to room temperature naturally. After cleaning with dilute hydrochloric acid and drying in the vacuum, self-supporting NiFeP film was obtained. The loading capacity of catalyst (about 1.5 ​mg ​cm−2) was calculated by the weight change of the NF. The NiFe-PBA film also was directly oxidized to NiFe2O4 film (loading capacity about 1.5 ​mg ​cm−2) in the air as a comparative test."
6,Preparation of commercial Pt/C working electrode,"2.5 Preparation of commercial Pt/C working electrode As reported in the literature, 2 ​mg commercial 20% platinum carbon (Pt/C), 500 ​μL ethanol and 25 ​μL Nafion solution were mixed together and ultrasonic for 30 ​min, and then dripped on NF (3 ​μL, loaded about 1.5 ​mg ​cm−2) with pipette, dried at room temperature to obtain a commercial platinum (Pt/C) carbon supported NF working electrode."
7,Results and discussion,"The NiFe-PBA film was prepared by LPE LBL method grown on NF which was immersed in the aqueous solution of Ni(OAc)2 and K3[Fe(CN)6] sequentially (Fig. 1). After 10 LPE growth cycles, homogeneous NiFe-PBA film was well-prepared on the NF. In order to prepare metal phosphide [30], sodium hypophosphite (Na2HPO2) was selected as the phosphorus source. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the NiFe-PBA film and sodium hypophosphite were put into crucible separately and phosphating intube furnace protected by inert gases. As the temperature rised to 350 ​°C, the sodium hypophosphite would produce PH3 which had strong reducibility, the bimetallic phosphide NiFeP film was obtained by the reaction between NiFe-PBA film and PH3. The picture contrast of the thin film before and after phosphating treatment were shown in the bottom of Fig. 2 (a). For comparison, the NiFe-PBA film was also directly oxidized to NiFe2O4 film in the air(Fig. S2)."
8,Chemical phase analysis,"3.1 Chemical phase analysis The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NiFe-PBA film in Fig. 2 (b) at 18.1°, 25.6°, 36.2° and 40.5° are exactly corresponds to the (200), (220), (400) and (420) peaks of KNi[Fe(CN)6] (JCPDS No. 51–1897), which indicates the NiFe-PBA film has been successfully prepared by LPE LBL method. The diffraction peaks of NiFeP film at 40.7°, 47.4°, 54.3° and 74.9° are corresponds to (111), (210), (300) and (400) peaks of Ni2P (JCPDS No.03–0953). The diffraction peaks of the NiFe-PBA film are disappeared after phosphating treatment and NF is not fully phosphated due to the protection of NiFe-PBA film. No diffraction peaks of Fe phosphide is detected in the XRD patterns, means that Fe atoms may be doped into the lattice site of Ni2P [38], which can improve the activity of metal sites and increase the catalytic efficiency. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 3 a show the 3D porous NF has round and smooth pores average size about 200–300 ​μm. NF is regard as an ideal electrode material due tolarge surface area and excellent electrical conductivity. The high-resolution SEM images in Fig. 3 (b) show the NiFe-PBA film is formed by interleaving cubic crystals (the average size is about 200–300 ​nm),which is homogeneous distributed, closely connected and interleaved with each other. The morphology of NiFeP film obtained by phosphating treatment and the high-resolution SEM image in Fig. 3 (c) shows that the NiFeP film is composed of irregular nanosheets about 40 ​nm thick, which will expose more active sites in the catalytic process and improve its electrocatalytic performance. The lattice fringes with 0.22 ​nm observed in the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image Fig. 3 (d) are assigned to the (111) planes of Ni2P. It is coincident with the XRD analysis above, further illustrating the successful preparation of bimetal phosphide. The chemical compositions of NiFeP film are further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ni 2p XPS peaks at 852.1eV and 869.3 ​eV in Fig. 4 (a) are assigned to the binding energy (BE) of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 respectively. The peaks at 873.0 ​eV and 855.4 ​eV are assigned to the BE of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of Ni2+ and the peaks at 879.7 ​eV and 861.3 ​eV are the satellite peaks of Ni2+ [39,40]. The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum in Fig. 4 (b) can be split into two characteristic peaks at 707.40 and 712.6 ​eV, which is consistent with the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Fe2+ [41]. It is noteworthy that no peaks of Fe phosphide is detected, indicates that Fe atom is doped into the lattice of Ni2P rather than a mixture of two phases [42]. The XPS spectrum of P 2p in Fig. 4 (c) shows that the peaks at 128.4 and 129.3 ​eV are assigned to the BE of P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 in Ni2P and the strong peak at 132.7 ​eV belong to oxide due to long-term exposure to the air [43]. The XPS of O1s in Fig. 4 (d), the peaks at 530.4 ​eV and 532.0 ​eV are attribute to the ferronickel oxide and water molecule respectively [44]. As a summary, XPS analysis indicate that the NiFeP film is composed of Fe atom doped Ni2P."
9,Electrochemical testing,"3.2 Electrochemical testing A standard three-electrode system was used to test the catalytic performance of NiFeP film (loading capacity about 1.5 ​mg ​cm−2). The catalytic performance of blank NF, NiFe2O4 film and commercial platinum carbon (Pt/C) also were measured for comparison. All tests were carried out in 1 ​M KOH solution and all data were corrected by IR-compensation. To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of different electrode materials, the overpotential when the current density reaches 10 ​mA ​cm−2 is always used for comparison. The LSV curves of different electrode materials in Fig. 5 a show that the prepared NiFeP film exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance at an overpotential of 98 ​mV which is pretty close to the commercial Pt/C. The overpotential of NiFe2O4 film and NF are about 300 ​mV with inferior performance. To gain further insight into the different electrode materials, the corresponding Tafel plots were tested in Fig. 5 (b). Typical Volmer Heyrovsky reaction takes place on the electrode surface and the ion reaction is the speed determining step [45], that means low Tafel plots slope process smaller reaction resistance and faster catalytic reaction rates, vice versa. The commercial Pt/C process the lowest Tafel plots slope about 42 ​mV dec−1, followed by the NiFeP film (with 99 ​mV dec−1), the blank NF (with 158 ​mV ​dec−1) and NiFe2O4 film (with 122 ​mV dec−1). The overpotential and Tafel plots slope of the electrode materials at 10 ​mA ​cm−2 are summarized in Fig. 5 (c). The overpotentials of commercial Pt/C, NiFeP film, NiFe2O4 film and blank NF at 10 ​mA ​cm−2 are 30, 98, 306 and 316 ​mV respectively. The performance compared with other electrocatalytic materials in Fig. 5 (d) indicates that the HER performance of NiFeP film is better than most electrocatalytic materials reported in the literature [42,46–52]. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of NiFe2O4 and NiFeP film is used for detecting the electrode kinetics in HER process in Fig. 5 (e). The semicircle in high frequency range on the Nyquist plot attributes to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), which is related to the electrocatalytic kinetic. The lower value means lower reaction resistance and faster reaction rate. The Rct of NiFeP film is much smaller than NiFe2O4 film, which means that the conductivity of NiFeP film has been significantly improved after phosphating treatment. The electron transport path and gas diffusion model during the HER process of NiFeP film are illustrated in Fig. 5 (f). Owing to the 3D porous structure and excellent electrical conductivity of NF substrate, rapid electrons transported rates and fast gas released rate are achieved in the framework. All of these evidences suggest that the electrocatalytic efficiency and reaction rate of NiFeP films are greatly improved after phosphating treatment. Stability is another key parameter to assess the properties of electrocatalytic materials. The durability of the presented NiFeP film was tested under a static current density of 10 ​mA ​cm−2. As shown in Figs. S4–S6, the NiFeP film exhibits excellent stability with negligible current density attenuation of less than 4% over 30 ​h. After the stability test, the SEM morphology and XPS spectrum of the sample are maintained and the XRD peaks still fit well. All the above results show that the NiFeP film has excellent HER activity along with high stability."
10,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the NiFe-PBA film was prepared successfully on the NF substrate surface by LPE LBL method. Then, self-supporting, uniform and intact NiFeP film was obtained by in-situ phosphating treatment at relative low temperature. The XRD and XPS analysis proved that the NiFeP film was composed of Fe atom doped Ni2P. The SEM images showed the NiFeP film had nanoflake structure, which would expose more active sites, prevent catalyst agglomeration and improve the electron transfer efficiency. The LSV curve indicated the NiFeP film only requires overpotential of 99 ​mV at 10 ​mA ​cm−2 and ran stable for 30 ​h without obvious performance degradation even at 100 ​mA ​cm−2. It implied that the NiFeP film had excellent HER catalytic performance and cycle durability. This in-situ phosphating preparation of NiFeP thin film avoided the use of binder, improved the structural strength and cycle stability, and it’s of great significance in industrial alkaline electrolyzer hydrogen production."
