0,Introduction,"Due to environmental problems and resource depletion, more and more attention has been paid to wood and other renewable materials (Dávila et al., 2017). Wood is the main source of cellulose fibers for pulping and paper making. It consists of four main components: cellulose (35–50%), hemicellulose (20–35%), lignin (10–25%) and extractives (2–8%). In the typical chemical pulping process, 80% lignin and 50% hemicellulose are removed. The degraded hemicellulose in the waste liquor is burned together with lignin in the process of chemical recovery. However, the heat value of hemicellulose is about 13.6 MJ/kg, only about half of that of lignin (Amidon and Liu, 2009). Therefore, the more economical use of hemicellulose is to extract them before pulping, and then convert them into high value-added products, such as xylitol, alcohol, adhesives and other chemicals (Gírio et al., 2010; Zhuang et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010). Hemicellulose, as the second major carbohydrate in plant fiber materials besides cellulose, can be extracted by a variety of methods. Compared with other technologies such as alkali, dilute acid and organic solvent treatment, auto-hydrolysis has some advantages in environmental friendliness and economy, and has been extensively studied by many researchers (Mendes et al., 2009; Mao et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018). In auto-hydrolysis pretreatment, hydronium ions could react with acetyl groups on the side chain of hardwood xylose, and the acetic acid obtained could be used as a catalyst to further promote the removal of acetyl groups and the hydrolysis and dissolution of hemicellulose (Gütsch et al., 2012; Li et al.,2014; Fang et al.,2019), so the content of hemicellulose in wood chips will be significantly reduced. There are many researches have been done on this topic. The removal of hemicellulose in auto-hydrolysis pretreatment could break the acetyl group on hemicellulose and the hydrogen bond on adjacent cellulose, expose more free hydroxyl groups on cellulose, open the fiber structure and form more voids between fibers, resulting in the emergence of new voids, the increase of void volume and specific surface area (Santos et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2016), and the air in the voids of wood chips was replaced by steam (Malkov et al., 2001b), which improved the accessibility and chemical penetration efficiency of lignocellular cell walls. In the subsequent alkali impregnation process, alkali solution was easier to penetrate into the cell wall of fibers, thus enhancing the effect of wood alkali impregnation (Yoon and van Heiningen, 2008). In Jiang’s study (Jiang et al., 2016), the effect of hemicellulose content change in pre-hydrolyzed poplar wood on alkali impregnation in subsequent chemical mechanical pulping was discussed under the condition of combined hydrolysis factor (CHF) of 0–100. The results showed that hemicellulose removal increased the porosity of poplar fiber cell walls, thereby improving the alkali impregnation effect of poplar, which verified this view. Duarte (Duarte et al., 2011) studied the effect of auto-hydrolysis on the mechanical properties of kraft pulp fibers. It was found that after hemicellulose removal during hot water pretreatment, the fiber length did not change, but the content of fine fibers decreased, the tensile strength and breaking strength of handmade papers also decreased, but the pulp viscosity increased. In the process of auto-hydrolysis, besides hemicellulose dissolution, wood chips also exhibited other behaviors. Lignin, as one of the key factors affecting the diffusion of soluble substances, would undergo complex physical changes and chemical reactions in the pretreatment process. Under acidic conditions, the main chemical reactions were the breaking of the β-O-4 bond with free hydroxyl groups and other degradation reactions (Hou et al., 2014), resulting in the increase of phenolic hydroxyl group content, while lignin became small molecular lignin fragments and partially dissolved into the hydrolysate; After hydrolysis, the aliphatic hydroxyl groups in the residual lignin decreased, and these groups represented the reaction sites of lignin sulfonation reaction. Therefore, deactivation of sulfonation during subsequent acid sulfite cooking resulted in damage to delignification (Yu et al., 2015; Anita et al., 2019; Fasching et al., 2005). As lignin melted and migrated through cell walls, lignin, due to its hydrophobicity, polymerized with itself or carbohydrate degradation products to formed droplets attached to the surface of wood chips (Leschinsky et al., 2008b). Studies have also shown that hemicellulose produced acid-insoluble substances in the process of treating holocellulose with dilute acid, which was called pseudo-lignin (Sannigrahi et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012), similar to the chemical structure of lignin, could coalesce into spheres attached to the surface of fibers. At the end of the reaction, with the decrease of temperature, some lignin suspended or dissolved in solution is prone to acid-catalyzed condensation because of its high reactivity, which resulted in the formation of high-molecular-weight viscous precipitates and gradually cooled pseudo-lignin and lignin-carbohydrate condensates, which adhered to or deposit in the surface of wood chips or in the voids of wood chips. It hindered the degradation and dissolution of hemicellulose. These complex behaviors might dissolve lignin in some solvents. Ma et al. found that phenyl ethanol mixture could remove partially degraded lignin, resulting in a decrease in lignin content (Ma et al., 2014). The possibility of solvent extraction affecting lignin had also been studied. For example, most lignin could be extracted from pre-hydrolyzed wood with organic solvents (Shi et al., 2016); lignin could be extracted from bioethanol residues at 50 °C (Alaine et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2011). The results showed that the lignin could be extracted from phenyl ethanol mixture to a certain extent under certain conditions. However, this phenomenon had not been studied in detail, such as the effect on the performance of subsequent chemical pulping and final pulp. At present, little research had been done on the effects of sediments produced during auto-hydrolysis on the physical morphology, chemical composition, absorbability and pulping properties of wood chips. Therefore, the potential effects of the surface sediments of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips on the subsequent chemical pulping and the final pulp properties were discussed through the analysis of the surface morphology, benzene-alcohol extractive, wettability, absorbability and kraft pulping of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips."
1,Experimental materials and methods,
2,Experimental materials,"2.1 Experimental materials Acacia wood chips were provided by Asia Symbol (Shang dong) Pulp and Paper Co., China. After dust removal and impurity removal, the wood chips balance the moisture for two weeks. The moisture content was determined for experiment. The specifications of wood chips were 1–2 cm in length, 0.8–1.2 cm in width and 1–2 mm in thickness."
3,Auto-hydrolysis process conditions and calculation of P- factor,"2.2 Auto-hydrolysis process conditions and calculation of P- factor The auto-hydrolysis experiment was carried out in an electric cooking pot (ZQS1-E, Xian yang, Tong da Light Industry Equipment Co., Ltd.). The liquid/solid ratio was 4:1, the absolute dried capacity of the wood chips was 400 g. The heating phase started at 40 °C and bleed briefly at 105 °C for 5 min, then continued to heat until the highest temperature was 170 °C and then hold for 0–90 min. After the auto-hydrolysis, the reaction tank was taken out and cooled in cold water, and then the unwashed auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips (WX) were collected after filtration by Brinell funnel (stand for about 20 min until there was no more hydrolysate flowing out from Brinell funnel). A part of the WX were washed to neutral with deionized water and collected as washed the auto-hydrolyzed acacia chips (YX). The YX and a small amount of WX were air-dried under natural conditions (moisture control at 6–8%) for subsequent chemical component analysis and absorption properties testing, while the remaining auto-hydrolyzed wood chips filtered through the Brinell funnel were used for subsequent kraft pulping. In order to further compare the obtained data, the P-factor was used to determine the combined effect of temperature and time (i.e., severity or intensity) during the auto-hydrolysis, and the P-factor corresponding to each auto-hydrolysis condition was calculated by Simpson expansion (Sixta, 2006) (see Table 1 ). At the same time, the P-factor of the original wood chips as the control group was 0:"
4,Kraft pulping,"2.3 Kraft pulping The original wood chips and the unwashed auto-hydrolyzed wood chips were subjected to kraft pulping in a ZQS1-E cooking pot. The conditions of the kraft pulping process were as follows: a liquid/solid ratio of 4:1, 15% alkali, 30%sulfidity, cooking temperature of 165 °C and the holding time of 150 min."
5,Surface morphology and chemical composition detection of auto-hydrolyzed acacia chips,"2.4 Surface morphology and chemical composition detection of auto-hydrolyzed acacia chips Scanning electron microscopy (SEM): The surface morphology of the original wood chips and the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips were observed by scanning electron microscopy (s-3400n, Hitachi, Japan). Chemical composition analysis: the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips and raw material grinding powder, and 40–60 mesh wood powder was taken for component analysis. The moisture and ash were determined according to GB/T 2677.2-1993 and GB/T 2677.3-1993. The content of holocellulose, benzene-alcohol extractive and pentosan were determined according to GB/T 2677.10-1995, GB/T 2677.6-1994 and GB/T 2677.9-1994. Detection of benzene-alcohol extractive: the lignin content of benzene-alcohol extractive was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Cary300, VARIAN Co., Ltd.) at 205 nm, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the benzene-alcohol extractive was recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (One-B, PE Co., Ltd.) in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. A KBr disk containing 1% finely ground benzene-alcohol extractives was used for determination."
6,Determination of absorption properties of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips,"2.5 Determination of absorption properties of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips Alkali or water impregnation of wood chips: after auto-hydrolysis and air-dried, 30 g (o.d.) of the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips were put into plastic sealed bags, and then 300 mL 0.5 mol/L NaOH solution or deionized water was added into the sealed bags of each group, and the air in the bags was discharged as far as possible and the sealing bags were sealed. After the wood chips and the NaOH solution or deionized water were sufficiently and completely contacted at 25 °C, the sealed bags containing the wood chips were placed in a constant temperature water bath pot at 25 °C, and the bags were moved once every 5 min for an immersion time of 60 min. Alkali impregnation measurement: After the impregnation was completed, the wood chips were taken out and the impregnation liquid was collected. The residual alkali amount of the impregnating liquid was measured and the alkali consumption per gram of dried wood chips was calculated in mg/g. Water impregnation measurement: After the impregnation, all groups of wood chips were taken out and the excess liquid on the surface of water-impregnated wood chips were removed carefully with quantitative filter paper. The quality of wood chips after water-impregnation was measure by electronic balance, and the water absorption per gram of the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips in each group was calculated in g/g. Measurement of surface contact angle: five pieces of original wood chips, WX or YX with relatively flat surface and similar shapes, sizes and other aspects were selected to measure the static contact angle of wood chips by pedestal drop method (Theta, Sweden Baolin Technology Co., Ltd.). Measurement of specific surface area: the specific surface area of original wood chips and auto-hydrolyzed wood chips was measured by a surface area and a pore size analyzer. The test sample was first vacuum dried at 100 °C for 4 h, after which the dried wood chips were cut into strips (1–2 cm in length, 1–2 mm in width and 1–2 mm in thickness) with scissors and analyzed by BET nitrogen adsorption isotherm (Tian et al., 2014)."
7,Detection of pulping properties of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips,"2.6 Detection of pulping properties of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips After cooking, all the pulp in the cooking pot was poured into the pulp bag and washed clean to get the unscreened pulp. The unscreened pulp was screened by the sieve machine (the sieve gap size was 0.15 mm) to obtain the screened pulp. After the water was equilibrated, the yield of screened pulp was determined. The Kappa number and viscosity of pulp were measured according to GB/T 1546-1989 and GB/T 1548-1989. The contents of benzene-alcohol extractive, pentosan and lignin in the pulps were determined according to the Section 2.4. Handsheets of each screened pulp were prepared by manual handsheet-making machine (ASM-32N2F, China). The basis weight of each handsheet was 60 g/m2. The tensile index of handsheets was determined according to GB/T 453-1989, and tear index was determined according to GB/T 455.1-1989."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Surface morphology and chemical composition of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips,"3.1 Surface morphology and chemical composition of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips 3.1.1 Surface morphology of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips The surface morphology of the auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips were observed by SEM. The results showed that the surface of the control sample was smooth, while the surface of the unwashed wood chips after auto-hydrolysis contained a large number of spherical deposition substances, which increased with the increasing auto-hydrolysis intensity. By comparing the WX and YX, it could be found that the spherical sediments adsorbed on the surface of wood chips cannot be completely removed by deionized water washing. 3.1.2 Main chemical components of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips The moisture content of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips with different auto-hydrolysis strengths was determined after washing with deionized water and air-dried, and the yield of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips was calculated. After grinding, 40–60 mesh wood powder was used to determine the main chemical composition of wood chips, and the content of each chemical component measured was the relative to the percentage of the original wood chips, as shown in Table 2 . From Table 2, the yield of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips rapidly decreased to 86.79% in the early stage of hydrolysis (P-factor < 188), and then slowly to 77.85% as the degree of auto-hydrolysis deepened. It was well known that hemicellulose was the most easily dissolved part of lignocellulose structure by auto-hydrolysis. When P-factor was 404, the content of pentosan rapidly decreased to 10.87%. After that, as P-factor continued to increase to 995, the content of pentosan slowly decreased to 6.84%. Generally, it was considered that the complex cellulose or carbohydrate in wood fiber includes cellulose and hemicellulose, which was closely related to the performance of chemical pulping process. It could be seen from Table 2 that in the early stage of auto-hydrolysis, the content of holocellulose in hydrolyzed wood chips rapidly decreased from 73.58% in the control group to 52.45% in the P-factor of 306, and slowly decreased to 49.75% when the P-factor increased to 995. By calculation, it was found that about 20% cellulose in the original wood chips was dissolved after hydrolysis. These findings were consistent with previously reported results that the structure of polyxylose and polyglucose in wood consists of two parts (Borrega et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 1999): the soluble part and the more difficult extracted part. In addition, polyglucose was more stable than xylose when the chips were hydrolyzed. In addition to holocellulose, the content of klason lignin also showed a trend of gradual decrease with the increase of P-factor, and the kalson lignin content decreased by 14% when the P-factor was 995. 3.1.3 Benzene-alcohol extractive from auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips Generally, the content (in wt%) of organic solvent extractives in the lignocellulosic material for papermaking is quite few. Although the content of these compounds was not much, it would have a certain impact on the pulping and papermaking properties of fiber raw materials. The presence of extractives could increase the consumption of medicine during cooking, delay the cooking process and affect the color of pulp. It could be seen from Table 2 that the content of benzene-alcohol extractive in wood chips after auto-hydrolysis increased from 1.36% in raw materials to 9.42% in the P-factor of 808, which was consistent with the change rule of surface sediments of the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips. The benzene-alcohol extractives from auto-hydrolyzed wood chips were further determined by FT-IR. 3371 cm−1 was the stretching vibration of OH, 2933, 2848 cm−1 was the stretching vibration of CH2, 1721 cm−1 was the stretching vibration of CO, 1607, 1521 cm−1 was the skeleton vibration of the aromatic ring, 1423 cm−1 was the deformation vibration of CH3 or CH2, 1324 cm−1 was the deformation vibration of OH, and 1047 cm−1 was the CO deformation vibration of methoxy groups. In addition, according to Liu, Villaverde et al., it was pointed out that the lignin structure fractured in the process of auto-hydrolysis was prone to condensation reaction, and then deposited and adsorbed on the surface of wood (Liu et al., 2008; Villaverde et al., 2009). Therefore, the benzene-alcohol extractives were detected by UV spectroscopy. It could be found that there was an absorption peak at 205 nm of the ultraviolet spectrum, the absorption peak value increased with the intensifying of auto-hydrolysis. By calculation, the lignin content in the benzene-alcohol extractive increased from 16.42% in the control group to 47.68% when the P-factor was 808. For that, it was believed that the benzene-alcohol extractive from auto-hydrolyzed wood chips contained some lignin substances, which were derived from the surface sediments of wood chips, which gave rise to an increase of benzene-alcohol extractive."
10,Absorption properties of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips,"3.2 Absorption properties of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips 3.2.1 Surface contact angle of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips The change of surface contact angle was mainly caused by the interaction of water and wood surface, which was affected by surface free energy and surface chemical functional groups (Bao et al., 2004). Thus, the contact angles of YX and WX were measured respectively. From Fig. 1 (a), it could be found that the contact angle of the YX and the volume of water droplets decreased with increasing auto-hydrolysis intensity. The decrease of contact angle indicated that the surface free energy of auto-hydrolysis wood chips decreased, which improved the wettability of wood chips. The volume reduction of water droplets on the wood surface was mainly due to the water infiltrating into the porous structure of wood chips during the wetting process (Alain et al., 2016). However, the contact angle of WX decreased rapidly at first and then increased with the increase of P-factor. The reason for the difference from the phenomenon of washing wood chips might be that the hydroxyl-containing substances adsorbed on the surface of the wood chips during the hydrolysis process, resulting in an increase in the surface wettability of the wood chips at the auto-hydrolysis early stage; as the degree of auto-hydrolysis deepened, a large number of sediments on the surface of wood chips blocked the pores of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips, causing the increase of contact angle. 3.2.2 Effect of auto-hydrolysis strengths on absorption properties of acacia wood chips Water impregnation and alkali impregnation experiments were respectively carried out on the air-dried original acacia wood chips, WX and YX, and then the water absorption and alkali consumption were measured. The results were shown in Fig. 1(b). It could be seen from the figure that in the water immersion experiment, the water absorption amount of WX and YX were significantly increased compared with the control groups. This was because hydronium ions could react with the acetyl groups on the side chain of the hardwood xylan during the auto-hydrolysis treatment, and the resulting acetic acid acted as a catalyst to further promote the removal of hemicellulose (Li et al., 2014). The degradation of hemicellulose and the dissolution of a small amount of acid-soluble lignin in wood fibers increased the volume porosity of wood cells, thus improving the fluid capillary effect and improving the water absorption capacity of wood chips (Xu et al., 2016). From the figure, it could be also seen that the water absorption of wood chips increased rapidly in the early stage of auto-hydrolysis (P- factor < 306), but tended to be stable with the further deepening of auto-hydrolysis. This might be due to the fact that after P-factor > 306, the sediments on the surface of auto-hydrolysis wood chips partially hindered the water penetration, resulting in little change in water absorption properties. One of the potential disadvantages of auto-hydrolysis kraft pulping was the reduced subsequent cooking efficiency (Hamaguchi et al., 2013). Considering this problem, in order to explore the influence of auto-hydrolysis on the absorption of cooking liquid, alkali immersion experiments were carried out on auto-hydrolyzed wood chips with different auto-hydrolysis strengths. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the alkali consumption of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips increased gradually as the degree of auto-hydrolysis deepened. This indicated that auto-hydrolysis could promote the impregnation of acacia chips in NaOH solution. From this point of view, the use of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips as raw materials was conducive to chemical pulping. During the auto-hydrolysis process, more free hydroxyl groups was exposed on cellulose due to the removal of acetyl groups by hydronium ions. At the same time, a large amount of hemicellulose was degraded and dissolved in the form of oligomers, which increased the pore volume (Xu et al., 2016). All of these could improve the accessibility of the lignocellulosic cell walls. In the case of alkali solution, this would cause more alkaline solution to permeate into the fiber cell wall. However, the alkali consumption of WX was substantially higher than that of YX, which was due to the fact that WX contain more residual acid and consume more alkali. When the P-factor was greater than 306, the alkali consumption of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips basically did not change. The reason for this phenomenon might be that the sediments formed during auto-hydrolysis were adsorbed on the surface of wood chips, blocking part of the pores, resulting in lower accessibility and hindering the penetration of alkali solution. 3.2.3 Specific surface area of auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips In this experiment, the specific surface area of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips with the P-factor of 0, 188, 601, 995 was measured. It could be seen from the Fig. 1(c) that whether the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips were washed or not had a great influence on the specific surface area of the wood chips. In the early stage of auto-hydrolysis (P-factor < 188), the specific surface area of YX increased relative to the raw material, which was due to the removal of hemicellulose by auto-hydrolysis, the opening of fiber structure and the formation of more pores between fibers, resulting in the increase of specific surface area. At the later stage of auto-hydrolysis (P-factor > 601), a large amount of sediments were adsorbed on the surface of the wood chips, resulting in the decrease of porosity and specific surface area. The specific surface area of WX was smaller than that of the control group, and gradually decreased with the increase of the auto-hydrolysis strengths. By comparing the specific surface area of YX and WX, it could be concluded that the sediments deposited on the surface of the wood chips during auto-hydrolysis process had an important impact on the specific surface area of the wood chips, and the specific surface area would affect the penetration of subsequent pulping cooking liquid."
11,Pulping properties of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips,"3.3 Pulping properties of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips 3.3.1 Pulping yield of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips In order to explore the effect of auto-hydrolysis on pulping properties of subsequent acacia wood chips, kraft pulping was carried out on the unwashed auto-hydrolyzed wood chips. Fig. 2 (a) showed that the unscreened pulp yield and screened pulp yield of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips kraft pulping decreased with increasing auto-hydrolysis intensity. It was noteworthy that in the early stage of auto-hydrolysis (P-factor < 306), the yield of unscreened pulp and screened pulp decreased rapidly from 49.52% and 46.62% to 39.01% and 35.59%, respectively. It can also be seen from Fig. 2 (b) that when the P factor < 306, the content of pentosan in the pulp decreased rapidly from 14.43% to 2.99%. When P-factor was 995, the yield of unscreened pulp decreased slowly to 36.13%, and the yield of screened pulp still decreased rapidly to 28.41%.This was mainly due to the rapid dissolution of chemical components in wood chips at lower auto-hydrolysis strengths, resulting in a rapid decline in the unscreened pulp yield. When the strength of auto-hydrolysis was further strengthened, the chemical components in wood chips and the yield of wood chips changed slowly, and the yield of unscreened pulp decreased slowly. After P-factor > 306, the reason why the yield of screened pulp still decreased rapidly may be that more residual acid in the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips would consume more cooking liquid, resulting in the decrease of the actual amount of alkali used for cooking. At the same time, as shown in Fig. 1(a), a large amount of sediments were deposited on the surface of wood chips, resulting in difficult infiltration of cooking liquid, incomplete lignin removal, more pulp residue, more benzene-alcohol extractive in pulp and lower yield of screened pulp. From the numerical point of view, when the P-factor reached 995, the screened pulp yield decreased to 28.41%, which was about 39% lower than the maximum value of 46.62%, so the pulp yield lost a lot. Therefore, in order to add hemicellulose extraction process before the production of acacia kraft pulp, it was necessary to consider the surface sediments of wood chips, the extraction rate of hemicellulose and the impact on subsequent pulping. 3.3.2 Kappa value and viscosity of pulp As can be seen from Fig. 2(c), the Kappa number of pulp made from auto-hydrolyzed acacia wood chips increased gradually with increasing auto-hydrolysis intensity, from 13.9 in the control group to 31.3 in the P-factor of 995, which indicated that auto-hydrolysis had adverse effects on the delignification process of subsequent kraft pulping. There were several reasons for this disadvantageous effect: (1) the process of auto-hydrolysis was mainly the degradation and dissolution of holocellulose and pentosan components. Therefore, under the same cooking conditions, the relative amount of delignification required in the pulping process of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips increases, resulted in the difficulty of delignification in the cooking process increased with the increase of the degree of auto-hydrolysis, which ultimately resulted in the increase of lignin content in pulping; (2) due to the water-retaining structure of wood, the moisture content of wood chips after auto-hydrolysis reaches 60%-70%, and the hydrolysate of this part of wood contains organic acids, and the main reaction system of kraft pulping was alkaline. Therefore, the residual organic acids in this part of wood would consume the effective alkali in the cooking system, and the reduction of alkali content in the medicinal liquor would also make the lignin removal difficult during the cooking process; (3) the adsorption of sediments on the surface of wood chips had an adverse effect on the permeation of the cooking liquid (Li et al., 2007). At the same time, when the P-factor < 188, the pulp viscosity increased from 841 mPa·s to 959 mPa·s; and when P-factor > 188, the viscosity decreased from 959 mPa·s to 597 mPa·s. This was because after the auto-hydrolysis, most of the short-chain hemicellulose was dissolved in the hydrolyzate, and the proportion of long-chain cellulose in the pulp increased, which led to an increase in viscosity. Under the condition of P-factor < 188, the more hemicellulose lost, the higher the viscosity was. In contrast, when P-factor > 188, the cellulose would be degraded more seriously, the ratio of carbohydrate to short-chain would increase, and the viscosity would begin to decrease (Lu et al., 2012). 3.3.3 Physical strength of handsheets At the same time, the tensile index, tear index and other physical strength measurements were carried out on hand-made paper pretreated with different auto-hydrolysis strength (P-factor), as shown in Fig. 2(d). Without beating treatment, the tensile index of the handsheets decreased rapidly from 51.3 in the control group to 31.9 in the P-factor of 808, a decrease of about 38%. The decrease in tensile index was due to the higher Kappa number (Fig. 2(c)), which reduced fiber flexibility. Furthermore, as reported in the literature, the loss of tensile strength might also be caused by pre-extraction of hemicellulose, which reduced the connection between the fibers in the handsheets. At the same time, the tear index changed significantly when P-factor < 808."
12,Conclusion,"With intensifying the severity of auto-hydrolysis, the sedimentary substances on the surface of hydrolyzed wood chips gradually increased. The benzene-alcohol extractives of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips increased from 1.36% in the control sample to 9.42% in the case of P-factor at 808. At the early stage of auto-hydrolysis (P-factor < 306), the absorbability of the auto-hydrolyzed wood chips improved and after that gradually decreased. Sediments on the surface of auto-hydrolyzed wood chips had negative effect on the subsequent kraft pulping, the yield of screened pulp decreased, the Kappa number of the pulp increased, and the tensile strength of handsheets decreased."
