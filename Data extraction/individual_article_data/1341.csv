0,Introduction,"Sugarcane is the major commercially grown agriculture crop in India. It is cultivated on more than 4.91 mha of area with a productivity of 69.5 tonnes/ha in both tropical and sub-tropical regions of the country [1]. Processing of sugarcane for sugar generates sugarcane bagasse (SCB), which is a lignocellulosic residue accounting for about 100 million tonnes annually in India [2]. SCB is generally composed of cellulose (40–42%), hemicellulose (28–30%), lignin (18–20%), other polysaccharides (4–5%), saccharose (3%) and 2.4% of ash (w/w) [3,4]. The current use of SCB is limited to cogeneration (steam and power) [2,3], however cogeneration is not a sustainable valorization route considering the potential of SCB. Many SCB valorization routes have been reported for the production of biofuels [5–7] and bioproducts like paper, food additives, xylitol (sugar alcohol) and cellulosic derivatives [3]. SCB can be used as feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production (2G ethanol). However, prior to ethanol production several steps including biomass conditioning and pretreatment are required [8]. Pretreatment is one of the major steps for the separation of cellulose from lignin and hemicellulose [3]. Dilute acid pretreatment with sulfuric acid (1–5%) at a temperature ranging from 120 to 180 °C and pressure up to 1.01 MPa is the most effectual strategy for hemicellulose removal, mainly releasing ∼ 90% of xylose [9–11]. In 2G ethanol production process the cellulosic fraction is enzymatically hydrolyzed into glucose and fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae with high yield (upto 0.40–0.51 g/g) [12]. However, the xylose rich stream derived from the acid pretreatment step cannot be utilized by wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, requiring genetically engineered yeast strain or other xylose utilizing organisms [8]. This makes the hemicellulosic fraction least attractive for this purpose. Therefore, value addition to this stream is required in order to mine fullest potential of the feedstock within biorefinery concept. Sugars derived from hemicellulosic fraction have the potential to be used as feedstock for bio-H2 production through dark fermentation process [13]. Bioconversion of xylose to bio-H2 is an effective route to recover additional resource from the feedstock, which is otherwise wasted [12]. In recent years green H2 is gaining more attention as it is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels and does not generate any toxic by-products upon combustion [14–18]. Bio-H2 production can be performed either by employing pure or mixed cultures. However, using mixed culture has several advantages over pure culture which includes no requirement for sterilization, co-fermentation of mixed substrate and enhanced adaptation potential of the biocatalyst [17–19]. Theoretically, bio-H2 production results in yield of 3.33 mol H2/mol xylose when the soluble metabolites of fermentation are acetate and 1.67 mol H2/mol xylose when the soluble metabolites are butyrate [11]. During bio-H2 production one-third of the carbon present in substrate is converted to H2 and CO2, while the remaining two-third is converted to short chain fatty acids (SCFA)/volatile fatty acids (VFA) namely acetic, butyric and propionic acid, which have several industrial applications [17,20]. As acidogenic effluent (AE) from bio-H2 production process is a complex mixture of unutilized substrate and by-products, purification of the desired product is complicated and expensive. Thus, an alternative route for sustainable utilization of AE is required. Value addition to AE containing VFAs may give an additional revenue source to commercial bio-H2 production. VFAs are reported to have the ability to solubilize soil bound phosphate by lowering the pH of soil [21,22]. Therefore, regular supplementation of VFA rich AE in soil has been postulated to have similar impact on phosphate solubilization for agricultural use. The aim of the study is simultaneous production of renewable bio-H2 and bioethanol from different hydrolysate streams of SCB with integration of organic farming. The study is designed in three phases, where in phase I viability of bio-H2 production from pure xylose was evaluated by optimizing operational parameters viz., pH, organic load and nature of inoculum. Further to validate the obtained results, segregated hydrolysate streams of SCB were utilized. SCB was initially hydrolysed with acid and the xylose rich hydrolysate was subjected to dark fermentation for bio-H2 and VFA production. The unhydrolysed biomass rich in cellulose recovered after acid hydrolysis step was subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for bioethanol production. Finally to close the loop in biorefinery framework, VFA rich AE from bio-H2 production process was evaluated as phosphate solubilizing organic fertilizer (PSOF) in a real field condition. Methodology was designed to mine fullest potential of the feedstock with an integrated and zero waste discharge approach."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biocatalyst,"2.1 Biocatalyst 2.1.1 Biohydrogen production The anaerobic mixed culture/inoculum was procured from the final sedimentation tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Hyderabad. The seed sludge was screened through 0.15 mm stainless steel sieve to eliminate coarse materials and was kept under anaerobic condition for several days before being used. The parent inoculum was enriched in designed synthetic wastewater (DSW; NH4Cl-0.5 g/L, KH2PO4-0.25 g/L, K2HPO4-0.25 g/L, MgCl2-0.3 g/L, CoCl2-25 mg/L, ZnCl2-11.5 mg/L, CuCl2-10.5 mg/L, CaCl2-5 mg/L, MnCl2-15 mg/L, NiSO4-16 mg/L, FeCl3-25 mg/L, xylose-5 g/L) under anaerobic condition at pH 6.0 for 48 h. The enriched culture was used either in pretreated or untreated form in the experiments. To selectively enrich bio-H2 producing bacteria, the anaerobic mixed culture was heat-pretreated at 100 °C for 2 h. Heat-pretreatment at (100 °C, 2 h) suppresses nonspore forming bacteria and helps to harvest spore-forming bacteria [23,24]. 2.1.2 Bioethanol production The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCIM 3594 was obtained from NCIM, National Chemical Laboratories, Pune, India. The active culture of yeast strain was prepared on yeast extract peptone dextrose broth (YPD media) (composed of glucose: 20 g/L, peptone: 20 g/L and yeast extract: 10 g/L) at 28 °C and 180 rpm."
3,Experimental details,"2.2 Experimental details 2.2.1 Biohydrogen production The experiments were composed of three phases. In phase I, experiments were carried out to optimize process variables viz., pH, organic load and nature of inoculum/biocatalyst to assess bio-H2 production from xylose through dark-fermentation (Table 1 ). Experiments were performed in continuous stirred bioreactor with a working volume of 500 mL and gas holding capacity of 100 mL (head space) to determine the biogas productivity by anaerobic mixed inoculum (AMPTS II- Bioprocess Control, Sweden). The gas outlets of the bioreactors were connected to biogas flow meter through silicon pipes for continuous online measurement of biogas produced. The measuring resolution of the gas flow meter cells were 2 mL of biogas per channel. All the bioreactors were kept in a temperature controlled water bath at 37 °C and unidirectional agitation was adjusted at 60 rpm. Eight parallel experiments were performed in phase I with different combination of selected factors viz., untreated inoculum (UT) and heat-pretreated inoculum (T) with feeding pH of pH 5.0, pH 6.0, pH 7.0 and pH 8.0. T-5 to T-8 and UT-5 to UT-8 represents operation at varied pH, ranging from pH 5.0 to pH 8.0. The pH adjustment was conducted with 0.1 N HCl and NaOH. The methodology was initially evaluated with DSW (composition mentioned above) with organic load of 10 g xylose/L (ORL I) as substrate. Total 6 cycles were evaluated for bio-H2 and VFA production with HRT of 72 h. Average of all cycles has been represented for total biogas (TBG), gas composition, substrate utilization and VFA composition. The output from initial experiments yielded an optimized condition for two parameters viz., nature of inoculum (biocatalyst) and feeding pH. Based on the optimized conditions further optimization of organic load was established. Experiments were carried out at three ORLs (ORL I- 10 g xylose/L, ORL II- 20 g xylose/L and ORL III- 40 g xylose/L). All experiments were evaluated at similar conditions in duplicates. In phase II, validation of designed methodology was evaluated with real field substrate i.e, SCB from Gayatri Sugars Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad. Initial characteristics of SCB like carbohydrate, lignin and ash content were analyzed as per NREL protocol [25]. Particle size of SCB in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 mm was used in the experiments. For pretreatment, SCB at a solid loading of 10% (w/v) was mixed with dilute H2SO4 (2%, v/v) and autoclaved at 121 °C for 60 min. After pretreatment the liquid hydrolysate rich in xylose was used for bio-H2 production after neutralization followed by filtration. Real field study for bio-H2 production was performed with heat-pretreated inoculum at pH 5.0, pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 based on the results from phase I. SCB-T represents operating conditions for bio-H2 production with real field feedstock. Further, the unhydrolysed solid residue obtained from acid pretreatment step was collected and washed under tapwater till neutral pH was attained and then it was utilized for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for bioethanol production. In phase III, AE from bio-H2 production process was utilized as PSOF. The designed methodology depicts complete utilization of SCB in a closed loop biorefinery approach with an aim of establishing zero waste discharge process (Fig. 1 ). 2.2.2 Bioethanol production Unhydrolyzed SCB from acid pretreatment step was subjected to SSF for bioethanol production. SSF was carried out in 500 mL reactor vessel with working volume of 331 mL. The solid fractions of SCB obtained after pretreatment was subjected to 0.05 M citrate buffer at solid loading of 20% (w/v). Cellulase from Aspergillus niger (Sigma), was used for saccharification of cellulose rich acid treated SCB. The enzyme load per gram of treated SCB was maintained at 10 U cellulase/g treated SCB. 10% (v/v) yeast culture was inoculated in the same reactor vessel for bioethanol production. SSF experiment was conducted under nonsterilized condition at pH 5.0 for 48 h at 37 °C. Ethanol and glucose concentration was analyzed regularly at fixed interval. Process and biochemical yield of bioethanol were calculated as per Eqs.1 and 2, respectively [26].

The initial VFA and pH observed after mixing AE from all the reactors were 4920 mg/L (acetic acid: 1409.4 mg/L; butyric acid: 3510.6 mg/L) and pH 4.5. The real field experiments were conducted in plastic pots of dimension 22 × 25 × 24 cm and capacity of 2 kg at CSIR-IICT, Hyderabad. The soil was red sandy and the chemical composition was as mentioned: organic matter 1.01%, non-soluble material 90.47%, iron 3.61%, magnesium 0.70%, aluminum 2.92%, lime 0.56%, potash 0.24%, soda 0.12%, nitrogen 0.08% and phosphorus 0.03% [21]. Cicer arietinum (Chick pea) was selected as test plant. Chick pea seeds were procured from local nursery and 20 seeds were sown in each pot by making small pits of about half inch. Watering was done at regular intervals to maintain water holding capacity in the soil. On every 5th day, 200 mL of AE was added to test pots (accounting to 10%, v/w). The concentration of VFA was measured by taking soil from the rhizospheric region of the plants (nutrient rich region of the soil immediately surrounded by the plant root) after 24 h of addition of AE on 5th, 20th, 35th and 45th day. Available phosphorus in soil was measured after 24 h of adding AE on 20th, 35th, and 45th day whereas, phosphorus content in shoot and root was analyzed at the end of the experiment on 65th day. Total phosphorus concentration was analyzed as per Bray and Kurtz (1945) method [27]. Plant growth based on shoot length was measured regularly whereas root length was measured at the end of the experiment. Total number of fruits and flowers grown during the study was recorded manually on regular basis. Tests were performed in duplicates."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The performance of experimental sets were evaluated by monitoring TBG, gas composition, total VFA production, VFA composition, substrate utilization, dehydrogenase enzyme activity and pH at regular pre-defined time intervals. pH and total VFA were estimated according to the standard APHA (1998) method [28]. Dehydrogenase (DH) enzyme activity was estimated by colorimetric method based on the reduction of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) [29]. Results presented and discussed are average of duplicate experimental outputs. Sampling of both liquid and gas was done at different time interval for analysis. Concentration of sugars, ethanol, and VFA composition were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu LC20A, Japan), employing a RID detector (wavelength 210 nm) and Rezex monosaccharide H+ (dia: 300 × 7.8 mm; particle size: 5 μm, flow rate: 0.5 mL/h). The mobile phase was milliQ water. For the analysis, 1 mL of sample was diluted with 99 mL of milliQ water. The diluted sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to remove any solid particles. Again the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter and 20 μL samples were injected for analysis. Biogas composition was analysed using gas chromatography (GC; Agilent 7890) using thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with Heysep Q 80/100 SS-packed column (1/8″ × 2.0 mm) employing Argon as carrier gas (10 mL/min). The injector and detector were maintained at 80 °C each and the oven was operated at 100 °C isothermally. The volumetric yield of bio-H2 was calculated based on xylose consumption. Xylose to VFA conversion efficiency was calculated as per Eqs. (3).

5,Results and discussion,
6,Dark fermentation of xylose - phase I,"3.1 Dark fermentation of xylose - phase I 3.1.1 Biohydrogen First phase of the experiment was initially performed with pure xylose at ORL I to establish optimum feeding pH and inoculum type for bio-H2 production. Theoretically, H2 production results in the yield of 3.33 mol H2/mol xylose when the soluble metabolites of the fermentation are acetate (Eq. (4)) and 1.67 mol H2/mol xylose when the soluble metabolites are butyrate (Eq. (5)), respectively [11].

All the bioreactors were operated for 6 cycles to assess the capability of xylose towards bio-H2 production. Average of all cycles has been represented for TBG and bio-H2 production. TBG produced by untreated inoculum at the end of operation was in the following range UT-6 (508.7 mL), UT-7 (448.1 mL), UT-8 (377.4 mL) and UT-5 (328.2 mL). TBG produced by heat-pretreated inoculum was observed to be highest in T-7 (622.3 mL) followed by T-6 (588.9 mL), T-8 (440.8 mL) and T-5 (213.8 mL) (Fig. 2a). Gas composition of the different bioreactors showed distinct variations (Fig. 2b). Biogas composition analysis showed higher bio-H2 production with heat-pretreated inoculum compared to untreated inoculum with all the operating pH conditions which is due to the selective enrichment of specific bio-H2 producing bacteria. For heat-pretreated inoculum maximum bio-H2 production was observed at 48 h (32–44%). T-7 noted maximum bio-H2 production (44% of TBG i.e, 257 mL) (221.5 mL H2/g xylose) followed by T-6 (43% of TBG i.e, 242.1 mL) (153.7 mL H2/g xylose), T-8 (38% of TBG i.e, 148.1 mL) (132.8 mL H2/g xylose) and T-5 (32% of TBG i.e, 65.2 mL) (45.75 mL H2/g xylose). Further decrement in bio-H2 production was observed till 72 h. No methane (CH4) production was observed in heat-pretreated systems (T-5, T-6 and T-7) till 48 h. In T-8, CH4 production was observed from 48 h onwards while minute CH4 production was observed in T-5, T-6 and T-7 from 60 h onwards. At 72 h CH4 production was observed in the order as mentioned T-7 (1.34% of TBG i.e, 8.3 mL) > T-8 (1.09% of TBG i.e, 4.8 mL) and T-5 (1.09% of TBG i.e, 2.3 mL) > T-6 (1.05% of TBG i.e, 6.1 mL). A consistently lower CH4 concentration in heat-pretreated systems indicates the suppression of methanogens. Methanogens are the end consumers in anaerobic decomposition of carbon that produce CH4 as a final product. Pretreatment of the parent inoculum suppresses the methanogenic activity and results in enhanced bio-H2 production in the system. In the present study heat-pretreated inoculum at pH 7.0 and temperature 37 °C yielded highest bio-H2 from xylose. Similar observation has also been reported by other research groups [8,30,31]. In the case of untreated systems at 48 h the volumetric bio-H2 yield was as mentioned: UT-6 (37.5 mL H2/g xylose) followed by UT-7 (31.6 mL H2/g xylose), UT-8 (26.02 mL H2/g xylose) and UT-5 (23.28 mL H2/g xylose). UT-7 noted maximum bio-H2 production at 60 h (24% of TBG i.e, 107.5 mL) followed by UT-8 (22% of TBG i.e, 83 mL), UT-6 (21% of TBG i.e, 106.8 mL) and UT-5 (20% of TBG i.e, 65.6 mL). CH4 production was observed from 24 h onwards and showed maximum yield at 72 h in the following order UT-7 (12% of TBG i.e, 53.7 mL), UT-8 (11% of TBG i.e, 41.5 mL), UT-6 (9.5% of TBG i.e, 48.3 mL) and UT-5 (8% of TBG i.e, 26.2 mL). In untreated systems decrement of bio-H2 with an increase in CH4 after 60 h is attributed to methanogenic activity as methanogens convert H2 and CO2 to CH4. Methanogenesis is subsequent step of acetogenesis where methane producing bacteria convert weak organic acids (acetic acid) and H2/CO2 into CH4 at low partial pressure [18]. However, heat-pretreatment of inoculum at (100 °C for 2 h) successfully suppresses non-spore forming bacteria (mostly methanogens) and helps to harvest spore-forming acidogenic bacteria [23,24]. Similar trend in suppression of CH4 formation by heat-pretreated inoculum was observed in the present study. Methanogenic bacteria (MB) are non-sporulating while acidogenic bacteria (AB) can form protective spores under extreme environment and can grow over a broad pH range [18]. Also, with every pH condition heat-pretreated inoculum showed higher process efficiency. 251 mL H2/g xylose from granular reactor and 221 mL H2/g xylose from biofilm reactor operated by pretreated inoculum at 60 g/L xylose has been reported which is similar to this study [13]. Several studies on xylose based bio-H2 production using mixed anaerobic culture have been also reported [30–36]. Considerable influence of pH was observed during the operation where pH 7.0 showed more efficiency towards bio-H2 production compared to other pH conditions. This is because xylose utilizing microbes are more active at neutral pH conditions due to the stability of enzymes [8]. Acidic pH showed decrement in process efficiency. 3.1.2 Xylose utilization In all the experimental conditions, gradual increment in xylose utilization was observed with time (Fig. 3 ). In the case of untreated inoculum, UT-6 showed higher xylose utilization (86.1%) followed by UT-7 (84.3%), UT-8 (83.5%) and UT-5 (80.4%) at 72 h. In the case of heat-pretreated inoculum, T-7 showed maximum xylose utilization (88.65%) followed by T-6 (85.25%), T-8 (84%) and T-5 (82.8%) at 72 h. Xylose utilizing microbes are reported to be more active at neutral pH due to the stability of enzymes [8], which is also observed in the present study. 3.1.3 Volatile fatty acids Initial pH of the respective systems was adjusted between pH 5.0 to pH 8.0 to check its effect on bio-H2 and VFA production. It is reported that acidic condition supports higher bio-H2 production by suppressing the growth of methanogens [18]. Similar trend is also noted in the present study where gradual decrement in pH due to VFA production was observed that supported higher bio-H2 yield. VFA production increased gradually with time which was well synchronized with the decrement in pH (Fig. 4 a). Inhibitory effect of VFA accumulation on bacterial growth and bio-H2 production is reported [37], however in the current study no inhibitory effect was observed. T-7 and UT-7 showed maximum VFA production of 3698 mg/L and 3581 mg/L during the end of the operation. VFA production by untreated inoculum ranged from 2983 mg/L to 3581 mg/L in the order as mentioned UT-7 (3581 mg/L) followed by UT-8 (3574 mg/L), UT-6 (3538 mg/L) and UT-5 (2983 mg/L) at the end of the operation. Neutral pH showed higher VFA production. Heat-pretreated inoculum represented relatively higher VFA yield compared to untreated inoculum. Pretreatment of inoculum in association with feeding pH showed significant influence on process with maximum VFA production by T-7 (3698 mg/L) followed by T-6 (3603 mg/L), T-8 (3596 mg/L) and T-5 (3353 mg/L). VFA production was in the order as mentioned (T-7 > T-6 > T-8 > T-5). The overall VFA production efficiency of heat-pretreated and untreated inoculum at different pH was in the following order T-7 > T-6 > T-8 > UT-7 > UT-8 > UT-6 > T-5 > UT-5. 3.1.4 VFA profile VFA profiling of heat-pretreated and untreated inoculum is depicted in Fig. 4b. VFA production increased gradually with time which was well correlated with pH drop. UT-7 showed maximum production of butyric acid (1576 mg/L) followed by acetic acid (1317 mg/L) and very less concentration of propionic acid (181 mg/L). UT-6 and UT-8 also showed butyric acid dominance (1521 mg/L and 1513 mg/L) followed by acetic acid (1514.25 mg/L and 1425 mg/L). UT-8 showed the presence of propionic acid (192 mg/L) and valeric acid (48 mg/L). Propionic and valeric acid production was possibly due to the enrichment of propionic and valeric acid producing bacteria in the untreated mixed culture at neutral and above neutral pH conditions. UT-5 showed higher acetic acid production (1289 mg/L) than butyric acid (911 mg/L). Heat-pretreated inoculum showed comparatively higher VFA yield than untreated inoculum. T-7 showed butyric acid production of 1683 mg/L followed by 1113 mg/L of acetic acid. T-6 showed 1631 mg/L of butyric acid followed by 1250 mg/L acetic acid and 370 mg/L propionic acid. Presence of propionic acid was perhaps due to the enrichment of propionic acid producing bacteria at favorable pH condition. Production of propionic acid from hemicellulose hydrolysate of corncob molasses at pH 6.0 has been reported [38]. T-8 produced 1546 mg/L and 1295 mg/L of butyric acid and acetic acid whereas T-5 produced higher acetic acid (1635 mg/L) followed by butyric acid (1520.3 mg/L). Systems operated at pH 6.0, pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 produced butyrate as the major liquid metabolite, followed by acetate which confirmed the dominance of butyrate-type metabolic pathway for bio-H2 production. Predominance of butyric acid production during acidogenic fermentation of xylose by mixed culture at mesophilic and thermophilic temperature and by hot spring culture in continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at 45 °C has been reported [33,37]. 3.1.5 Xylose to VFA conversion efficiency The amount of substrate bio-converted to VFA (acetic, butyric and propionic acid) was calculated using Eqs. (3). Xylose to VFA conversion efficiency was calculated in terms of individual acetic, butyric and propionic acid concentrations and also with the mixture of three fatty acids (Fig. 4c). As valeric acid was produced in very low concentration, it was not included in the calculation. The conversion efficiency was ranged in between 25 and 35 % in all the conditions at the end of the operation. In case of untreated inoculum the conversion efficiency was higher with UT-7 operation (30.97%) followed by UT-8 (30.9%), UT-6 (30.54%) and UT-5 (24.99%). Heat-pretreated inoculum showed higher conversion efficiency compared to untreated inoculum based operations. T-7 showed highest conversion efficiency of 33.33% followed by T-6 (32.38%), T-8 (32.31%) and T-5 (29.88%). When conversion efficiency was calculated based on individual fatty acids, butyric acid showed highest value with T-7 (16.33%) followed by T-6 (15.81%), T-8 (14.96%) and T-5 (14.70%). In the case of acetic acid, T-5 (15.85%) showed highest conversion efficiency followed by T-8 (12.45%), T-6 (12%) and T-7 (10.63%). Conversion of propionic acid was less compared to acetic and butyric acid and highest conversion was recorded with T-6 (3.2%). 3.1.6 Change in pH pH drop correlated well with bio-H2 and VFA production. Acidic condition promotes higher bio-H2 production by suppressing the growth of methanogens [18], similar results were also observed in the present study. Fig. 4d depicts the trend in pH variation. In batch culture, a change in system pH and substrate concentration might affect the process efficiency especially through the accumulation and distribution of liquid metabolites which are mainly VFAs [34]. During initial phase of operation pH dropped to pH 4.69 from initial pH 8.0 (UT-8). UT-7 dropped to pH 4.73 followed by UT-6 (pH 4.42) and UT-5 (pH 4.71) at 72 h during initial cycle. During the final cycle maximum pH drop was up to pH 4.19 in system with initial pH 5.0 (UT-5) followed by UT-6 (pH 4.42), UT-7 (pH 5.08) and UT-8 (pH 5.26). In case of heat-pretreated inoculum T-5 showed maximum drop upto pH 3.99 during initial cycle followed by T-6 (pH 5.02), T-8 (pH 5.21) and T-7 (pH 5.22) at the end of the operation. Gradual drop in pH was observed in every operating cycle. 3.1.7 Dehydrogenase activity Heat-pretreated inoculum showed higher DH enzyme activity over untreated inoculum and synchronized well with bio-H2 production and substrate degradation. Redox reactions for the inter-conversion of metabolites and transferring protons (H+) between metabolic intermediates are catalyzed by the DH enzyme using several mediators (NAD+, FAD+, etc.) and facilitates the H+ availability in the cell through redox reactions to make H2 [29]. These redox mediators are capable of carrying H+ and electrons (e-) and are known as energy carriers because they are involved in biological energy generation (ATP) [29]. Initially gradual increment in DH activity was observed with each operative cycle and reached a maximum value of 5.29 μg/mL of Toluene by T-7 at the end of operation followed by T-6 (4.36 μg/mL of Toluene), T-8 (4.27 μg/mL of Toluene), T-5 (4.09 μg/mL of Toluene), UT-7 (2.839 μg/mL of Toluene), UT-8 (2.48 μg/mL of Toluene), UT-6 (2.4 μg/mL of Toluene) and UT-5 (2.28 μg/mL of Toluene) (Fig. 4e). Untreated inoculum represented non-consistent increment in DH activity in the range (1.04 to 2.83 μg/mL of Toluene) throughout the operation. Whereas, the DH activity showed gradual increment for heat-pretreated inoculum which demonstrates the adaptation affinity of the biocatalyst towards bio-H2 production [29]. DH activity was observed in the order as mentioned T-7 > T-6 > T-8 > T-5 > UT-7 > UT-8 > UT-6 > UT-5. DH activity of heat-pretreated inoculum got stabilized towards increased proton shuttling between metabolic intermediates which leads to higher bio-H2 production [29]. 3.1.8 Optimizing organic load Initial experiments confirmed the effectiveness of heat-pretreated inoculum at pH 7.0 for maximum bio-H2 production. Based on the resultant optimum conditions, further experiments were performed at higher organic load [ORL-II (20 g xylose/L) and ORL- III (40 g xylose/L)]. At ORL II (heat-pretreated inoculum; pH-7.0), maximum bio-H2 production was observed at 36 h (42.5% of TBG i.e, 622.75 mL) (245.17 mL H2/g xylose) and TBG was 1465.3 mL. At 72 h TBG and VFA were observed to be 1655.6 mL and 6029.1 mg/L, respectively. VFA profiling showed dominance of butyric acid (2656.89 mg/L) followed by acetic acid (2213.35 mg/L). The increase in substrate concentration resulted in higher VFA accumulation, especially acetate and butyrate which resulted in decrement of the final pH to pH 3.56. Substrate utilization was observed to be 82.1% at the end of the operation. At ORL III maximum bio-H2 production was also observed at 36 h (40% of TBG i.e, 902 mL) (170.18 mL H2/g xylose) and TBG was 2255 mL. At 72 h TBG and VFA was noted to be 2456.9 mL and 6124.6 mg/L respectively. pH of the system dropped to pH 3.6 which was well correlated with VFA production. VFA composition depicted the predominance of butyric acid (2672.46 mg/L) followed by acetic acid (2148.43 mg/L). Substrate utilization was observed to be 83.56% at the end of the operation. Maximum 42.5% of bio-H2 with volumetric yield of 245.17 mL H2/g xylose was observed by ORL II and ORL III represented maximum of 40% bio-H2 at 36 h. Decrement in bio-H2 production might be due to the impact of higher organic load on biocatalyst, similar observation has been reported [18]. In our study, bio-H2 production showed decrement with increase in organic load but TBG production showed increment with increased organic load. Experimental results depicted that heat-pretreated inoculum yielded notably higher bio-H2 than untreated inoculum with butyrate and acetate as the major fermentative metabolites."
7,Fermentation of segregated streams of SCB (Real field application)- phase II,"3.2 Fermentation of segregated streams of SCB (Real field application)- phase II In order to further validate the results, SCB was evaluated as feedstock. Segregated hydrolysate streams of SCB were utilized for bio-H2 and bioethanol production. Initially SCB was pretreated with dilute H2SO4 (2%, v/v). The liquid hydrolysate was used for bio-H2 production while the unhydrolysed solid residues were subjected to SSF for bioethanol production. 3.2.1 Composition of SCB The total carbohydrate content in untreated SCB sample was observed to be 66.86% (w/w) on dry weight basis. Cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions were observed to be 38.86 ± 2% and 28 ± 2% (w/w) while total lignin and ash content were measured to be 22 ± 1% and 3.7 ± 0.5% (w/w), respectively. Cellulose is composed of glucose subunits linked with β-1,4 glycosidic linkage and the theoretical yield of glucose from cellulosic polymer was calculated to be 431.7 mg/g SCB using anhydro correction of 0.90 (or 162/180) [25]. Hemicellulose is chiefly composed of xylose and the theoretical yield of xylose was calculated to be 318.18 mg/g SCB using anhydro correction of 0.88 (or 132/150) [25]. The moisture content of SCB was observed to be 10.32% (w/w). Similar composition of sugarcane bagasse has been reported [42 ± 1% of cellulose, 30 ± 2% of hemicellulose, 20 ± 2% of lignin (w/w)] [3]. 3.2.2 Acid catalyzed treatment of SCB The acid hydrolysis of SCB majorly released pentose sugar. Xylose was the main pentose sugar in SCB hydrolysate which was derived from the hemicellulosic fraction of SCB when subjected to hydrolysis with 2% H2SO4 (v/v) at 121 °C for 60 min. Maximum concentration of xylose obtained after hydrolysis was 21.8 g/100 g SCB. Glucose and arabinose was found as minor sugars in hydrolysate and the maximum concentration obtained after primary acid hydrolysis was 1.87 g glucose/100 g SCB and 2.7 g arabinose/100 g SCB. Xylose is the most dominant monomeric sugar present in hemicellulose, while arabinose is present in arabinoxylans part of hemicellulose [32]. Xylose and arabinose yield with respect to initial hemicellulose present in biomass was observed to be 77.85% and 9.6% (w/w). Maximum of 84.2% and 12% (w/w) xylose and arabinose yield from SCB with 2% (v/v) H2SO4 pretreatment and 80.13 mmol xylose/L from acid hydrolyzed SCB with 1.6% H2SO4 (v/v) at 1:4 solid ratio (w/v) has been reported [8]. Maximum of 23.91 g/L xylose and 3.51 g/L glucose from sugarcane leaf waste, hydrolyzed with 2.75% H2SO4 (v/v) at 30% (w/v) solid loading is also reported [39]. Glucose is derived from cellulose or from some heteropolymers of hemicellulosic fraction of SCB. Glucose is most important source of carbon for microorganisms. However in this study, during acid hydrolysis glucose is produced in very less quantity which signifies that cellulosic fraction has not been depolymerised properly and thus further hydrolysis is required to recover glucose from cellulose. After primary hydrolysis, 66.2% biomass was recovered with 56.54% (w/w) of cellulose. Recovered biomass was subjected to SSF for the utilization of remaining sugars. In this study, acetic acid concentration of 1.2 g/100 g SCB was also detected during acid hydrolysis. Acetic acid is released from acetyl groups of hemicellulosic fraction and it may have inhibitory effect on microbial growth when present in higher concentrations. However in this study no inhibitory effect is observed as concentration of acetic acid in the hydrolysate was very low. 3.2.3 Dark-fermentation of hemicellulosic fraction of SCB In order to validate obtained results, SCB was evaluated as substrate for bio-H2 production. Acid pretreated SCB hydrolysate which was majorly composed of xylose was used for bio-H2 production. Initial xylose load was fixed to 20 g/L (ORL II) based on the results obtained from phase I. Highest bio-H2 production was noted at 36 h. Fig. 5 a depicts TBG and bio-H2 production of varied pH conditions (pH 5.0, pH 6.0 and pH 7.0) at 36 h. TBG produced at 36 h was in the following range SCBT-7 (1495 mL), SCB-T-5 (1310 mL) and SCB-T-6 (1376 mL). SCB-T-7 represented highest bio-H2 production (34.2% of TBG i.e, 511.29 mL) (204.5 mL H2/g xylose) followed by SCB-T-6 (32.5% of TBG i.e, 447.2 mL) (162.6 mL H2/g xylose) and SCB-T-5 (30% of TBG i.e, 393 mL) (174.6 mL H2/g xylose) at 36 h. TBG produced at 72 h by heat-pretreated inoculum was in the following order SCB-T-7 (1606.6 mL) > SCB-T-5 (1550.1 mL) > SCB-T-6 (1427.9 mL). Production of 265 and 177 mL H2/g carbohydrate (xylose and xylooligosaccharide) from acid and hydrothermally pretreated SCB has been reported [8]. Higher bio-H2 yield at neutral pH has been reported by many researchers which were also observed in the present study [8]. Bio-H2 production is mediated by hydrogenase enzyme, using electrons from reduced ferredoxin (Fdred) to reduce protons. Oxidized ferredoxin (Fdox) also obtains electrons from the oxidation of NADH, by NADH:Fd oxidoreductase (NFOR), and then reduced ferredoxin (Fdred) is oxidized with proton release for bio-H2 production. In these pathways, acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA are first converted to acetyl phosphate and butyryl phosphate by enzyme phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and phosphotransbutyrylase (PTB), respectively. These acyl phosphates are then converted to acetate and butyrate by acetate kinase (AK) and butyrate kinase (BK), respectively [12]. All the operating conditions showed gradual drop in pH with due time, which was well correlated with increase in VFA concentration (mainly acetate and butyrate). The total VFA production and profiling at the end of the operation was in the following order SCB-T-7 [total VFA: 5200.6 mg/L (butyric acid: 3450.5 mg/L; acetic acid: 1750.1 mg/L)] > SCB-T-5 [total VFA: 4716.3 mg/L (butyric acid: 2814.2 mg/L; acetic acid: 1902.1 mg/L) > SCB-T-6 [total VFA: 4223.5 mg/L (butyric acid: 2747.2 mg/L; acetic acid: 1476.3 mg/L) (Fig. 5b). Substrate utilization at the end of the operation was observed as mentioned, SCB-T-7 (85.1%) > SCB-T-5 (81.2%) > SCB-T-6 (79.2%). These results demonstrated great potential for bio-H2 production via dark fermentation through the use of hemicellulosic fractions derived from biomass pretreatment (Tables 2 and 3 ). 3.2.4 Bioethanol production from cellulose rich biomass Unhydrolysed biomass from acid catalysed treatment was collected and washed under tap water to neutralize the pH. The recovered biomass was composed of 56.54% cellulose (w/w), theoretical yield of glucose from cellulosic polymer was calculated to be 628.2 mg/g pretreated SCB. Recovered SCB was subjected to SSF with cellulases enzyme at a loading rate of 10 U/g biomass. SSF was carried out with 20% loading of biomass for 48 h, where 86.56% of cellulose was depolymerised into glucose and converted into ethanol by yeast fermentation. At 48 h maximum of 241.25 mg ethanol/g treated SCB was produced with productivity of 86.63% (Fig. 6 ). The unutilized substrate from bioethanol production process can be further used as carbon source for bio-H2 production. Acidogenic bacteria are capable to feed on wide variety of carbon sources. Therefore, this strategy would help to develop a net zero waste discharge process with high energy yield. Fig. 7 represents overall bio-H2 and bioethanol production process from SCB, integrated with organic farming."
8,VFA rich acidogenic effluent as phosphate solubilizing agent-Closing the loop - phase III,"3.3 VFA rich acidogenic effluent as phosphate solubilizing agent-Closing the loop - phase III Agricultural soil contains 0.03–0.05% of phosphorus out of that only 0.1% is available for plants [40,41]. Phosphorus is essential for metabolisms like biosynthesis of macromolecules, signal transduction, energy transfer, photosynthesis and respiration [42,43] and its deficiency can be identified by stunted plant growth and root development, early flowering and ripening [44]. Majorly in soil insoluble form of phosphorus is present [CaHPO4, FePO4, Ca3(PO4)2 and AlPO4] [21] which plants cannot utilize as they can uptake only orthophosphate ions (HPO4 -2 or H2PO4 -) [21,22,45]. Commercially available phosphate solubilizing biofertilizers (PSBs) are living microorganisms with less shelf life, capable of synthesizing organic acid which solubilize phosphate ions either by lowering the pH of soil or by chelating the cations of insoluble phosphate. Similarly, regular supplementation of VFA rich AE in soil has been postulated to have similar beneficial impact on phosphate solubilization. Fig. 8 a depicts the effect of regular addition of AE on soil pH. Decrement in soil pH helps in solubilization of phosphate mainly in the form of hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4 2-), dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4 -), and phosphate ion (PO4 3-) [21]. VFA as carbon source also supports the growth of phosphate solubilizing rhizobacteria (PSRB) which are involved in the mineralization of insoluble phosphate into available form [45]. VFA concentration in the rhizospheric region was measured after 24 h of addition of AE on 5th, 20th, 35th and 45th day. VFA consumption was observed as mentioned; 6th day (acetic acid: 81%; butyric acid: 52%), 21st day (acetic acid: 78%; butyric acid: 42%), 36th day (acetic acid: 73%; butyric acid: 48%) and 46th day (acetic acid: 75%; butyric acid: 34%) (Fig. 8b). Decrement in the concentration of VFA is well correlated with solubilization of soil-bound phosphate and growth and vigor of chickpea plants. Available form of phosphorus present in soil was measured after 24 h of adding AE on 20th, 35th, and 45th day. Initial concentration of available phosphorus in soil was less (6.4 mg/kg) whereas, regular supplementation of AE showed increment in available phosphorus concentration in soil on 46th day (50.3 mg/kg) (Fig. 8c). Total phosphorus content in shoot and root was analyzed at the end of the experiment (65th day) (Table 4 ). Phosphorus concentration in shoot and root was observed to be 0.008 mg/g and 0.015 mg/g in test plants and 0.005 mg/g and 0.007 mg/g in control plants. The growth of chick pea was assessed by measuring the number of fruits/flowers and length of root and shoot. The plant started to grow after 4th day of sowing seeds. Flowers were observed from 30th day onwards, where the test and control plants produced an average of 25 and 12 flowers. From 35th day onwards test plants produced an average of 28 fruits while the control plants produced an average of only 8 fruits (Fig. 9 ). The average length of the root and shoot for test and control plants were measured to be 24.5 cm and 21.1 cm. From 48th day onwards plants started drying and showed no fruiting and flowering and by 65th day all plants completely died."
9,Conclusion,"This study depicted an integrated strategy for complete utilization of feedstock for the production of bio-H2 and bioethanol along with organic farming by closing the loop. 2% H2SO4 (v/v) pretreatment of SCB released 21.8 g xylose/100 g SCB which was subjected to dark fermentation using heat-pretreated mixed inoculum for bio-H2 production. Maximum 34.2% (v/v) of bio-H2 with corresponding volumetric yield of 204.5 mL H2/g xylose and 5200 mg/L VFA was observed by heat-pretreated inoculum at pH 7.0 with initial ORL of 20 g/L. Unhydrolysed biomass recovered after acid pretreatment of SCB was composed of 56.54% cellulose (w/w). Recovered biomass was subjected to simultaneous saccharification with cellulase enzyme and fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 86.56% of cellulose was depolymerised into glucose and 241.25 mg ethanol/g treated SCB was produced at 48 h. Finally, to close the loop of this integrated process, VFA rich AE from bio-H2 production process was utilized as phosphate solubilizing agent in soil for the cultivation of Cicer arietinum (Chick pea). Regular addition of AE in soil increased the phosphorus availability. These results demonstrated great potential for integration of bioprocesses for recovering maximum resources from agri-biomass feedstock with net zero waste discharge in a biorefinery framework."
