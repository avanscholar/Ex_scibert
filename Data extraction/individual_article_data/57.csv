0,Introduction,"The selective hydrogenation of α-β-unsaturated aldehydes to get the corresponding alcohol is key demand in industries as it is used as intermediates in various synthetic procedures. It is naturally found in barks of Cinnamomum cassia [1] . The CAL molecule is rich in terms of its functional groups and conjugation among CC, CO bonds and aromatic ring [2]. The possible hydrogenation products are cinnamyl alcohol (COL) obtained by hydrogenation of CO, while CC hydrogenation produces hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) and deep hydrogenation (both CC and CO) results in hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL) [3,4]. Similarly, the hydrogenation of aromatic ring of CAL is peculiar due to vigorous reaction conditions. Cinnamyl alcohol is widely used in perfume industry, cinnamyl esters production, insect attractants and food flavoring due to its flowery smell and fragrance nature. Moreover, it is used in animal repellents, photosensitive polymers and multicolor ink devising. The total annual use of cinnamyl alcohol as fragrance is reported to be up to 1000 metric tons throughout the world. It is also widely used in cosmetics and detergents [5]. The future projected investment up to 2026 is hot issue of trade community. The scientific community needs intensive, innovative and novel research to fill up the demand and supply gap for the production of COL. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop processes that are green and sustainable without any limitations which is not possible without heterogeneous catalysis. The hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde has been extensively studied and literature survey shows that either these synthetic methods use vigorous reaction conditions such as high temperature and high pressure of H2 or expensive noble metals, with long reaction time [6,7]. For example, Pt/K-10 catalyst was used for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and CO was selectively reduced up to 97% after 17 h at 0.4053 MPa hydrogen partial pressure and 25 ºC [8]. Similarly, Ru supported CNT catalyst was used for hydrogenation of CAL, showing high conversion (80%) and selectivity (72%) of CAL to hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCMA) after 8 h at 3 MPa H2 pressure and 80 ºC [9]. Thus, the long reaction time and low selectivity to desire products are detrimental aspect of the reported method. Similarly, 12 wt% Pt/SiO2 coated tube reactor has been used for selective hydrogenation of CAL to COL with conversion ≈ 98.8% and selectivity ≈ 90% at 90 ºC, 1.5 MPa (H2) in 6 h [10]. On the other hand, palladium nanoparticles synthesized under microwave irradiation were used for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde and 97% of hydrocinnamaldehyde was obtained upon complete conversion in 7 h [11] at reaction conditions; 2.50 mg catalyst, 2 MPa H2 pressure and 100 ºC. Similarly, the effect of noble metal promotion has also been reported over supported Ni catalyst and higher conversion rate towards hydrocinnamyl alcohol was reported which was correlated to higher dispersion of Ni by promotion with Pd and Pt [12]. Breen et al. [13] correlated the selectivity of cinnamaldehyde conversion to cinnamyl alcohol with the steric effect. They observed that CC hydrogenation decreases as concentration of cinnamyl alcohol increases which cause steric hindrance to the hydrogenation of CC to absorb at the surface of catalyst. Microwave irradiation as a source of energy for chemical reactions is considered more environment friendly and fast as compared to conventional processes [14,15]. The MW has been used for reactions in organic chemistry, synthesis of nanoparticles and reactions which require high temperature and time [15–17]. Microwave irradiation has also drawn the attention of scientist in heterogeneous catalysis [18]. The rate of reaction in microwave system is found to be dependent on temperature, as high temperature is provided to the reacting substances very rapidly as compared to conventional systems. Thermal effect of microwave is due to the absorbed energy by the dielectric material in the form of heat energy and thus a hotspot is generated [19]. The hotspot generation under the microwave irradiation in heterogeneous catalysis is main cause of enhancement of rate of catalytic reaction [20]. The microwave assisted conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol has been reported using copper-based catalyst in cyclopentyl methyl ether solvent system. The use of microwave irradiation enhanced the conversion by 3–4 times and increased the selectivity as compared to conventional autoclave reactors [21] which motivates us to investigate the role of microwave irradiation in the synthesis of catalysts and hydrogenation of aldehydes. To the best of our knowledge, the microwave assisted synthesis of catalyst and its utilization in hydrogenation of CAL under the same protocol is not reported. In this work, we have tried to achieve a costless, environment friendly and quick procedure for the hydrogenation of CAL to COL with molecular hydrogen using t-ZrO2, Pd/t-ZrO2 and Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation. Our findings suggest that Pd/t-ZrO2 may be an effective catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of CAL to COL under microwave irradiation with high yield in less time and may be extended to industrial level for large scale production."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The chemicals and reagents used in this study were purchased from Merck, Sigma Aldrich and Alfa Aesar and used without any further treatment. The gases were supplied by British Oxygen Company (BOC) Pakistan Limited and used by passing through proper filters (Gas line filter-N930–1178 and N930–1193)."
3,Preparation of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of catalyst Solution of octahydrated zirconyl oxychloride (0.1 M/50 mL) was mixed with (0.05 M) urea, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS; 0.1 g), and 50 mL (0.05 M) NH4OH, and agitated/ sonicated for 30 min at 5 °C. The mixture was loaded to a modified narrow necked microwave reactor and irradiated for 30 min at low intensity (2450 MHz, 100 W) with continuous stirring (1000 rpm) as reported in previous work [22]. The homogeneous mixture was aged for overnight at 30 °C. The precipitate was separated through centrifugation and washed with 0.1 N HCl followed by continues washing in Soxhelt apparatus until pH = 7. The precipitate was dried (110 °C), calcined at 450 °C (1 °C min−1), retained for 4 h at same temperature under inert atmosphere (N2) and further treated in U-shaped reactor at 280 °C in H2/N2 (1: 3) gases mixture. PdCl2 (0.1 g) was dispersed in ethanol-water (1:1) system and agitated/sonicated for 30 min at 30 °C than added desired amount of ZrO2 and homogenize by sonication and stirring. The well dispersed mixture was loaded to narrow necked microwave reactor for irradiation (30 min). The suspension was centrifuged, washed, dried and calcined in same way. The procedure was repeated for the preparation of Ni-Pd/ZrO2 (detail: Supplementary Information, section 1.1)."
4,Blank & catalytic test,"2.3 Blank & catalytic test Blank test was conducted for confirming the suitability of solvent (DMF) under microwave irradiation and/or conventional thermal reaction (details: Supplementary Information, section 1.4). Similarly, substrate solution (0.001 M) without catalyst was fed to reactor under both microwave and thermal conditions with standard set of parameters to confirm autocatalysis (details: Supplementary Information, section 1.4). While catalysts screening was performed under; i. conventional heating: Parr reactor; 4590 series- 25 mL was loaded with 5 mL of substrate solution (0.001 M; cinnamaldehyde in DMF) and catalyst (0.025 g). The closed vessel was purged with N2 (3 times), heated to desired temperature (120 °C) and pressurized with H2 (1.034 MPa). The reaction was performed under continuous stirring (1000 rpm) to insured kinetic control regime, for desire duration (10–120 min). The reaction was reproduced multiple time under the same set of parameters. ii. microwave protocol: CEM Discover microwave reactor (model: 908010, USA) equipped with gas addition kit containing an in-situ fiber optic temperature controller, was loaded with 10 mL of substrate solution (0.001 M; cinnamaldehyde in DMF) and catalyst (0.05 g). The capped vessel was purged three time with N2, feed with H2 (1.034 MPa) and heated (120 °C) according to reported procedure [23] under microwave irradiation (2455 MHz, 300 W) as shown in Fig. S4b. The stirring was adjusted to maximum available range (high ~ 800 rpm) to exclude mass transfer effect for up to 40 min. The major products of reaction were identified and quantified by FTIR (Spectrum Two UATR two, PerkinElmer, Inc. USA) and Gas chromatograph (Clarus 580, PerkinElmer, Inc. USA), RTx column (Catalog # 12338: ID 0.25 µm, film thickness 0.5 µm and length 30 m) with FID and internal standard n-nonane respectively. The stability of solvent (DMF) was further confirmed by FTIR studies and no changes were observed under microwave irradiation as predicted from the spectra in Fig. S4a."
5,Characterization of catalysts,"2.4 Characterization of catalysts The morphology and weight percent composition of the samples were studied by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM: Model JEM-1010), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM: Model Hitachi S-4800) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyzer (EDX) (model: JSM5910-JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). For the analysis of phase and crystallinity, X-ray diffractometer (model: JDX-3532, Operational specification (20–40 kV, 2.5–30 mA, 2θ: 0–160° and CuKa λ = 1.5418 Å) JEOL, Japan) was used. Surface area analyzer (2200e-Quantachrome, NOVA, Inc. USA) was used for surface area and pore size analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis performed by TGA-50 DTA Shimadzu, Japan. Surface acid-site were explored by pyridine adsorption and NH3-TPD (details: Supplementary Information, Sections 1.5 and 1.6, Figs. S6 and S7)."
6,Computational calculations,"2.5 Computational calculations The first-principles calculations were carried out using the DMol3 [24,25] module in Materials Studio 8.0. The main calculations were conducted with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) [26] exchange-correlation function. Spin unrestricted geometry optimization were performed as shown in Fig. 1. (details: Supplementary Information, Section 1.2, Figs. S1 and S2)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Microwave synthesis and DFT study,"3.1 Microwave synthesis and DFT study The procedure to synthesized catalyst (t-ZrO2) under microwave protocol is obviously advantageous in comparison to conventional heating due to controlled size and shape (Fig. 3), while in supported catalysts (Pd/t-ZrO2) the dispersion and strong interaction of active metals with support [27,28]. Furthermore, theoretical calculation revealed that the rearrangement of support enhances Pd-Zr interaction and transfer of electron from Pd to ZrO2 (101) localized on Zr atom which reduces the Zr positive charge as shown in Fig. 2. Jung et al. [29] have calculated electron exchange and active metal interaction with cubic ZrO2 (111) surface and predicted that Pt has more interaction than Pd with ZrO2 (111) surface which is contradictory to our observation. Here, we calculated the interaction of Pd with t- ZrO2 surface (101), and predicted that the surface relaxation counted for monolayer adsorption of Pd on (101) surface of tetragonal zirconia. The rearrangement of support produces competition between the atop and 3-fold oxygen sites for Pd supported on the (101) surface between the most stable site atop and the 3-fold site which also enhances mobility for the Pd- layer on the interfaces (101) [30]. The most favorable adsorption site for Pd-layer on the (101) surface is the O-Zr-O terraces. This indicates that Pd accepts a higher coordination number when adsorbed on the oxide interface. In our case the effect of support relaxation on the adsorption energy, support rearrangement, electron exchange provides a clue that Pd-Zr has a strong interaction and energetically more stable on ZrO2 (101) surface just like Pt-ZrO2 (111) reported widely [29,31]."
9,Characterization,"SEM micrographs of t-ZrO2, Pd/t-ZrO2 and Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2 are shown in Fig. 3(a−c). The t-ZrO2 shows smooth morphology and flake like structures. Pd nanoparticles (Fig. 3.b) are well dispersed on the surface of t-ZrO2, while the nickel nanoparticles (Ni-Pd/ t-ZrO2) are also homogeneously dispersed thorough out on the surface as presented in Fig. 3.c. TEM images (Fig. 3(d−f)) confirms the tetragonal geometry of zirconia as the lattice fringes having d-spacing value of 0.29 nm (Fig. S3), widely reported in literature [32] with 83 nm crystallite size. The dispersion of Pd (9 nm) and Ni (5.2 nm) over zirconia surface clearly noted from TEM images, showing small particles size and uniform dispersion. The Fig. 3(g-i) presents EDX analysis of t-ZrO2, Pd/ t-ZrO2 and Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2, which revealed Pd and Ni particles are present on the surface of zirconia in about stoichiometric ratio (as synthesized) without any impurity. The XRD patterns (Fig. S3) reveal the peaks for t-ZrO2 at 29.9° (1 0 1), 34.4° (1 1 0), 50.1° (1 1 2), 59° (2 0 0) (JCPDS card no. 17–0923) [33]. The peaks at 38° (1 1 1), 45° (2 0 0) and 67° (2 2 0) correspond to face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of Pd (JCPDS card No.: 05–0681) [34], while the peaks at 40° (1 1 1) and 47° (2 0 0) show the presence of Ni (JCPDS card No. 04–0850) [12,35]. BET surface area studies revealed a nonsignificant decrease in surface area of t-ZrO2 with the incorporation of Pd nanoparticles. Further, small alteration in surface area was also observed with Ni loading, which might be due to the blocking of micropores of t-ZrO2 by metal particles. The surface area (m2/g) was found 35.1, 32.5 and 31.6 for t-ZrO2, Pd/t-ZrO2 and Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2 respectively. Park et al. [36] have attributed small decrease in the BET surface area of zirconia, after palladium deposition to pore blockage. However, catalytic activity was found to be independent of surface area under microwave irradiation. The thermal stability was investigated through thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and weight loss was observed as described in Fig. S5. Initially, the weight loss is attributed to surface H2O while beyond 180 °C, the changes are due to bulk oxygen. The active sites over the catalyst were investigated using pyridine adsorption method. The pyridine adsorption was observed for each catalyst and was found to be proportional to the number of active sites. Both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites were observed by having characteristics peaks at 1442 and 1538 cm−1 as shown in Fig. S6 [22,37]. The acidic properties of catalysts were evaluated by NH3-TPD. The Fig. S7 shows two types of desorption peaks corresponding to weak and strong acidic sites [38]. The peak at 500–540 K corresponds to weak acidic sites while peak at > 760 K corresponds to strong acidic sites [39,40]. NH3 desorption (μmole/m2) was observed 2.17, 2.29 and 2.31 for t-ZrO2, Pd/t-ZrO2 and Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2 respectively. Zhao et al. [41] have correlated Zr+4 density to surface acid-site while investigating the comparison of surface acid-site on monoclinic and tetragonal phase zirconia through pyridine adsorption and NH3-TPD techniques. The results obtained for Zr+4 density in (111) and (101) planes of t-ZrO2 are comparable with ours."
10,Catalytic activity,"4.1 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of the catalyst was screened for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in microwave and conventional systems under different reaction conditions. The reaction conditions were optimized as; MW: substrate solution (0.001 M, 10 mL) of CAL in DMF, catalyst (0.05 g), H2 (1.034 MPa), CEM microwave reactor, temperature (120 °C), time (40 min) / CH: substrate solution (0.001 M, 5 mL) of CAL in DMF, catalyst (0.025 g), stirring (~800 rpm) and H2 (1.034 MPa), Parr reactor, temperature (120 °C), time (40 min) and stirring speed (1000 rpm). Fig. 4 provides a comparison of thermal and microwave assisted hydrogenation at optimized reaction conditions. The %conversion in microwave irradiation is much higher as compared to conventional heating system. The conversion for both the systems increases linearly with time and the maximum conversion noted for MW and CH was 73.5% and 27%, respectively. MW system thus has a 46% improved performance over the conventional heating system. This enhancing effect is due the generation of hotspot by microwave irradiation in the bulk of t-ZrO2, [23,42], which enhances the formation of Zr+4 sites. The activated and highly heated t-ZrO2 results in enhanced metal support interaction along with transfer of heat to active metal. The metal support interaction favors not only the mobility of electrons but also alter the thermal conductivity of the bulk of catalyst, so that Pd redox activity is enhanced [43,44]. For comparison of catalysts (t-ZrO2, Pd/t-ZrO2 and Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2) productivity units (mmolg−1hr−1) rather than turn over frequency (TOF) were used in order to consider catalyst in bulk instead of active metal content. The order of productivity; Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2>Pd/t-ZrO2>t-ZrO2 was observed in both microwave and conventional heating system as shown in Fig. 5. The activity of t-ZrO2 is attributed to hot spots production in the bulk of zirconia which in turn increases Zr+4 density on the surface of catalyst. Furthermore, the Zr+4 density is directly related to surface acid site which is mainly responsible for the enhance productivity. While Pd incorporation increases the productivity due to redistribution of charges on Pd/t-ZrO2 interface [30]. Similarly, the Ni synergistic effect also plays a vital role in enhancing productivity towards upper end. The hydrogenation of CAL is shown in Fig. S8 in terms of reaction progress versus time. Initially the most common reaction is the conversion of CAL to COL. At the maximum conversion, secondary reaction of COL to HCOL occurs, thus decreasing the selectivity of the desire product. It is clear from the graph (Fig. S8) that the time of irradiation has a direct effect on conversion and selectivity. Behind optimal time (40 min), conversion rates of COL and HCOL are approximately equal (70 min), showing in equilibrium point between COL and HCOL while on further proceeding the selectivity purely switches to HCOL. The comparison of catalytic activity in terms of conversion and selectivity is described in Fig. 6. The least activity is reported for t-ZrO2. By the incorporation of Pd over zirconia, 13% enhancing effect was observed, while promoter (Ni) also alters catalytic activity by 24%. The enhancing effect in case of Pd is due to the metal support interaction between the Pd and ZrO2, as Pd+2 is converted to Pd+3 and Pd+4 under microwave energy transferring from t-ZrO2 to Pd metal as result of thermal excitation and metal support interaction as predicted from theoretical calculation. The synergistic effect of Ni further enhances the catalytic activity, is perhaps due to thermal conductivity and electron mobility. Similarly, the catalytic activity for CAL hydrogenation was also tuned for exploring the effect of local heating of precious metal (Pd) under microwave protocol as shown in Figs. S9 and S10. The high reactivity in MW can be hypothesized as (i) localized heating of the palladium, (ii) high mobility of electron on Pd and ZrO2 interface, (iii) stronger adsorbate interaction on Pd than on Pt surfaces and (iv) thermal conductivity. Precious metal supported catalyst (Pt/Al2O3, Pt/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3) widely used for organic transformation reactions and the activity was found dependent of thermal conductivity of support material [27]. Here, we observed that t-ZrO2 stands with support materials (alumina, ceria, silica etc) having good compatibility for microwave irradiation induced organic transformation reactions [45,46]. Valentine and co-worker [47] have investigated the behavior of metal nanopraticle and their compounds under microwave irradiation and catgorized in four different groups on the basis of interaction with microwave; (i) very weak MW-absorption, (ii) weak MW-absorption, (iii) moderate MW-absortion and (iv) intense MW-absorption. ZrO2 occupied position in the type i materials and can be heated up to 200 °C under microwave irradiation and therefore, can be tunned its characteristics by incorporation of other active metals. The development of microwave friendly catalysts for hydrogenation of aldehyde, optimization of catalyst and reaction parameters were widely studied and reported in literature as tabulated in the Table 1. The recent results achieved with palladium supported zirconia show good agreements with tabulated values for variety of supported noble metals and their nickel promoted versions. However, the target of the recent study was set as the hydrogenation of CO functional group under microwave irradiation with high conversion and selectivity while entry 1 and 2 in the Table 1 targets the CC bond hydrogenation which is thermodynamically more accessible than CO functional group. The furfural microwave assisted hydrogenation (entry 4, Table 1) was performed with Cu/TiO2 using 125 °C for 3 h while in the current investigation (entry 5, Table 1) the same results were achieved with Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2 at 120 °C in 40 min."
11,Stability of catalyst,"The reaction was performed at the optimized set of conditions in the absence of catalyst for the systems (microwave assisted and conventional heating) for the verification of autocatalysis. GC analysis confirmed the absence of autocatalysis. Similarly, the reaction mixture (reactants and catalyst) were loaded to MW-reactor and mixed by stirring in the absence of irradiation. The catalyst was separated from reaction mixture by centrifugation, the supernatant was again fed to reactor and exposed to irradiation under standard set of reaction parameters. The absence of any product confirmed both the easy and complete separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture as well the heterogeneity of the catalysts. The recovered catalysts were used further for 5 times and no loss in activity was observed. For Pd/t-ZrO2, the conversion and selectivity both were found to be almost constant upto five cycles, whereas in case of Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2, the conversion is slightly decreased as shown in Fig. S11. After five cycles the activity was found to decrease but the selectivity remained the same. The decreased catalytic activity was regained by washing with 0.1 N HCl and DDW, drying at 120 °C and calcination in N2 atmosphare for 4 h, and then further used for 5 cycles."
12,Conclusions,"Control shaped and size t-ZrO2 was synthesized under modified microwave irradiation method and utilized as a support for palladium and nickel promoted palladium catalysts. Well characterized catalysts were successfully used for the hydrogenation of CAL to COL under optimized set of parameters without using any base. The productivity was found in order of Ni-Pd/t-ZrO2 > Pd/t-ZrO2 > t-ZrO2 which revealed that Ni has synergistic effect with active metal (Pd) to promote the rate of hydrogenation. The DFT calculation revealed that Pd/t-ZrO2 is energetically stable due to high interaction of Pd with the t-ZrO2(101) surface and can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst in variety of organic transformation reactions. The activity of both microwave and conventional heating systems were compared and aforementioned system was found to be more efficient. The experimental results unveiled the advantageous aspect of microwave irradiated system in synthesis reaction. Here, we found the activity difference of both system (MW/CH) by a factor of 46% and suggested further research for exploring proper mechanism."
