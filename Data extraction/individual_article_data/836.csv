0,Introduction,"Environmental pollution and energy shortage are common problems in economic and social development [1–3] and, in order to solve them, all countries are committed to developing clean and renewable new energy sources [4]. Among them, hydrogen gas is widely used for clean energy, has great potential and so has been widely studied and developed [5–9]. The current various hydrogen production methods, such as methane steam reforming and coal vaporization, use non-renewable fossil fuels as raw materials, which cannot meet the requirement of sustainable development [10]. Semiconductor photocatalysis technology, being simple, economical and environmentally friendly, has become an important development direction for future hydrogen energy [11–14]. Among various oxide semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 is considered the most suitable for photocatalytic hydrogen production because of low cost, no secondary pollution, strong redox resistance, optical and chemical corrosion resistance and stability [15]. However, photocatalytic performance of pure TiO2 is poor, for two main reasons: (1) the wide band gap (3.2 eV) results in only absorption of ca. 5% ultraviolet light in sunlight, and almost no visible light absorption; and (2) the quantum efficiency is low, and photogenerated electron–hole pairs are easily recombined [16]. Therefore, in order to improve photocatalytic performance of TiO2, efforts are focused on two aspects: on one hand, extending its response range to visible light, such as metal doping [17,18] and non-metal ion doping [19,20]; and, on the other hand, improving the carrier separation efficiency and inhibiting electron–hole pair recombination, such as semiconductor heterojunction [21,22] and noble metal deposition [23,24]. In recent years, pyrochlore structure oxides (A2B2O7) have attracted the attention of researchers as semiconductor photocatalysts [25,26], in which tin-based pyrochlore is more important because it shows high catalytic activity in some important oxidation processes, including oxidation of hydrocarbons and partial oxidation of isobutylene [27]. For example, Tian et al. [28] synthesized Bi2Sn2O7 photocatalyst and observed high photocatalytic activity for As(III) removal under visible light. Phu et al. [29] synthesized Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles and observed photocatalytic decomposition of RhB dye under visible light. Wu et al. [30] prepared nanocrystalline Bi2Sn2O7 and found that it displayed much higher performance than Bi2O3 and bulk sample, benefiting from the high mobility of photoinduced charges resulting from the large band dispersion. Xing et al. [31] prepared Bi2Sn2O7–TiO2 nanocomposites and showed that the as-prepared composite had a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance. In spite of the enhanced photocatalytic activity over Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2, the degree of activity enhancement is expected to be further improved by more precise structural design due to the unsatisfied low catalytic activity under visible light. Compared to single heterojunction, double heterojunction has recently attracted increasing attention for boosting photocatalytic activity. In the family of pyrochlore structure oxides, Pr2Sn2O7 is of very similar structure to that of Bi2Sn2O7 [32], which facilitates the assembly of double heterojunction on the basis of Pr2Sn2O7, Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2. In this paper, construction of a double heterojunction composite photocatalyst is envisaged using Pr2Sn2O7, Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2. Electrospun TiO2 nanofibers are employed as substrate due to their porosity and better transport of charge carriers [33,34]. Moreover, the electrospun nanofiber mat can be an ideal platform to grow secondary or even tertiary structures [35–37]. Through the assembly of double heterojunction, broad solar absorption, effective charge separation and strong redox ability for photocatalytic hydrogen production are anticipated."
1,Experiment,
2,Preparation of composites based on TiO2 nanofibers,"2.1 Preparation of composites based on TiO2 nanofibers We first prepared Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 binary composite photocatalyst by hydrothermal method. Then, we prepared Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 ternary composite photocatalysts with different amounts of Pr2Sn2O7. The specific experimental procedure follows: 2 mmol SnCl4 was dissolved in 10 mL of NaOH (1 mol L−1), 1 mmol Bi(NO3)3 was dissolved in 5 mL of ethylene glycol., and different amounts (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mmol) of Pr(NO3)3 were dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water and magnetically stirred for 30 min until completely dissolved. After mixing all solutions and stirring for 2 h, 0.3 g of EDTA was added and pH was adjusted to 11 using NaOH. Then 10 mg of TiO2 nanofibers was added to the alkaline solution and transferred to a 50-mL autoclave to react at 180 °C for 24 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The as-obtained products were washed with ethanol and deionized water several times, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composites with different amounts of Pr2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composite were obtained. For simplicity, the Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composites are denoted as B/T. The Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composites prepared by addition of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mmol of Pr(NO3)3 reactant are denoted 1P-B/T, 2P-B/T, 3P-B/T and 4P-B/T, respectively. Details of preparation of TiO2 nanofibers and characterization techniques are shown in supporting information."
3,Photocatalytic production of hydrogen,"2.2 Photocatalytic production of hydrogen The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalyst was evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen production. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in a 100-mL side-illuminated quartz flask with a 350-W xenon lamp and an illumination intensity of 4.0 mW cm−2. Of photocatalyst, 0.1 g was added to an aqueous solution containing 10 mL of CH3OH at a reaction temperature of 30 °C. The apparatus was sealed by bubbling nitrogen for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen in the air and the solution in the bottle. The reactor was placed at a distance of 15 cm from a xenon lamp light source, and continuous magnetic stirring was required throughout the photocatalytic reaction to ensure the suspension state of the sample particles. After reaction for 1 h, 0.4 mL of gas was passed through a gas chromatograph (GC-14C, TCD, N2 carrier gas, 0.5-nm molecular sieve; Shimadzu, Japan). Dark reaction experiments and blank experiments, performed before each experiment, showed that neither produced hydrogen. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was tested under the same photocatalytic conditions described above, replacing only the light source with a xenon lamp with two monochromatic LED sources (3 W, 365 nm, Shenzhen Lamplic Science Co. Ltd.). Two LED sources were placed at a distance of 1 cm from the reactor so that the spot size on the wall of the bottle was about 1 cm2 and the light intensity was about 80 mW cm−2. A Bruker EMXnano spectrometer (298 K, 9.63 GHz) was used to detect radicals and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was added as a trapping agent."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Composition analysis,"3.1 Composition analysis The XRD patterns of TiO2 and composite samples show that TiO2 has seven distinct diffraction peaks at 25.5°, 37.9°, 48.2°, 54.1°, 55.0°, 62.5° and 75.1° (Fig. 1 ). These peaks are respectively assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (215) crystal faces of anatase TiO2, consistent with the standard card JCPDS 21-1272. Accordingly, the prepared TiO2 nanofibers are of anatase phase and have a good degree of crystallization. After hydrothermal reaction, the diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 in all samples are all well preserved, and only the intensities of the diffraction peak decrease, indicating that the structure and composition of TiO2 does not change during the hydrothermal reaction. The decrease of intensity of diffraction peaks results from the formation of additional components on the surface of the nanofibers. Sample B/T exhibits several new diffraction peaks at 28.8°, 33.4°, 47.9°, 56.8°, 59.6°, 70.0° and 77.4°. These diffraction peaks can be attributed to the crystal faces of (222), (400), (440), (622), (444), (800) and (662) of the cubic system Bi2Sn2O7, respectively, and are in agreement with the standard card JCPDS 88-496. The coexistence of Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2 in the XRD pattern indicates formation of binary Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composite nanofibers. After adding different amounts of Pr(NO3)3 to the hydrothermal reaction system, the characteristic XRD diffraction peaks of the original TiO2 and Bi2Sn2O7 are preserved. Additionally, there are a number of characteristic diffraction peaks with 2θ located at 29.2°, 33.8°, 48.6°, 57.6°, 60.5°, 71.2° and 78.7°, which are ascribed to cubic Pr2Sn2O7 [32]. Moreover, with the increase of addition of Pr(NO3)3, the peak shape of Pr2Sn2O7 gradually becomes obvious. This confirms that the Pr2Sn2O7 is also well constructed on the surface of TiO2 fibers, indicating that prepared samples 1P-B/T, 2P-B/T, 3P-B/T and 4P-B/T are ternary Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composites."
6,Morphology analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.2 Morphology analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The SEM images of TiO2 and composite samples are shown in Fig. 2 . First, the anatase TiO2 is fibrous with uniform thickness, large aspect ratio, good dispersibility and smooth surface and is free from other species (Fig. 2a). The average diameter of the fibers is 250 nm. When the hydrothermal reaction system is performed with no addition of Pr(NO3)3, a B/T heterojunction sample is obtained. The shape of the original TiO2 nanofiber is well preserved, but the surface is no longer smooth (Fig. 2b). A large number of Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles are constructed. The detail of the nanoparticles constructed on the surface of the fiber shows a similar “tetragonal pyramid” shape, with particles evenly distributed and of similar sizes of about 50 nm (Fig. 2b). When different amounts of Pr(NO3)3 are added to the hydrothermal reaction system, in addition to the Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles, Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheets are formed on the surface of the fiber. Moreover, with the increase in the amount of Pr(NO3)3, the nanosheets gradually increase in density, thickness and size. For 0.1 mmol Pr(NO3)3 added, the morphology of prepared sample 1P-B/T is displayed in Fig. 2c. There are a few nanosheets on the surface of the fiber. The size of the nanosheets varies, and the morphology differs. The maximum width is no more than 50 nm and the average thickness is about 10 nm. When the amount of Pr(NO3)3 added is 0.2 mmol, the density of nanosheets on the surface of fibers increases (Fig. 2d). The nanosheets are of similar size and blade-shaped, with an average width of 100 nm and thickness of about 18 nm. When the amount of Pr(NO3)3 added increases to 0.3 mmol, the morphology of sample 3P-B/T is the most regular, and the Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheets grow into a perfect fan-like shape of similar size, uniform distribution and arrangement (Fig. 2e). The nanosheet has a width of about 180 nm and thickness of about 25 nm. When addition of Pr(NO3)3 further increases to 0.4 mmol, the fiber morphology is destroyed and the Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheet begins to deform, accumulate and independently nucleate (Fig. 2f). The fibers are crosslinked and fused together. A partial scan of the sample 3P-B/T region by EDS mapping shows that it consists of five elements (Ti, O, Sn, Bi and Pr), has a uniform distribution and no other impurities (Fig. 3 ). This is consistent with the XRD test results, further confirming that the product consists of Pr2Sn2O7, Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2 nanofiber."
7,Morphology and composition by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM),"3.3 Morphology and composition by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) The TEM images of binary composite sample B/T and ternary composite sample 3P-B/T are shown in Fig. 4 a and b, respectively. The morphology of TiO2 nanofibers is intact, and the tetragonal pyramidal Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles and the fan-shaped Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheets are clearly visible, which is highly consistent with the SEM results. In the HRTEM images, we further analyze the microstructure of the above two samples. Two different lattice spacings can be seen in the B/T sample (Fig. 4c). One group of lattice spacing is 0.35 nm and the other is 0.31 nm, which correspond to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 and the (222) crystal plane of cubic crystal Bi2Sn2O7, respectively. Sample 1P-B/T contains three sets of lattice spacers with different spacing (Fig. 4d): the spacing of 0.35 nm is ascribed to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2; the 0.31 nm corresponds to the (222) crystal plane of the cubic system Bi2Sn2O7; and the 0.30 nm refers to the (222) crystal plane of Pr2Sn2O7. The intimate contact between Pr2Sn2O7, Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2 confirms that the Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 double heterojunction is successfully produced. This structural feature will facilitate transport of electrons and holes between different components and thereby promote separation of electron–hole pairs."
8,Mechanism of formation of double heterojunction,"3.4 Mechanism of formation of double heterojunction On the basis of above characterization results and related literature [38], it is speculated that the sample formation process is as follows [39]: (1) Sn4+ + 4OH− → H2SnO3 + H2O (2) 2Bi3+ + 6OH− + 2H2SnO3 = Bi2Sn2O7↓ +5H2O (3) 2Pr3+ + 6OH− + 2H2SnO3 = Pr2Sn2O7↓ +5H2O A schematic formation of a binary composite sample B/T and a ternary composite sample 3P-B/T are shown in Fig. 5 . At the beginning of the reaction, the hydroxyl group (–OH) [40,41] on the surface of the TiO2 nanofibers tends to bind the carboxyl group (–COO–) at the end of the EDTA molecular chain, which is similar to the esterification reaction between an alcohol and an acid. The EDTA is well known as a good chelating agent. When a certain amount of Bi(NO3)3 is added to the reaction solution, the carboxyl group at the other end of the EDTA molecular chain may chelate with Bi3+ [42,43]. The binding, chelation and dissociation Bi3+ on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers are dynamic. It is also possible that EDTA is first chelated with Bi3+ and then bonds to the surface of TiO2 nanofibers. In the alkaline environment of SnCl4, Sn4+ reacts with OH− to form H2SnO3 (Eq. (1)), and the concentration of H2SnO3 increases with the reaction. When the H2SnO3 concentration reaches a critical point, it reacts with Bi3+ ions accumulated around the TiO2 nanofibers and produces Bi2Sn2O7 nuclei (Eq. (2)). According to the characteristics of the pyrochlore structure, Sn forms an octahedron in the form of SnO6, and four octahedrons share the vertices and are stacked into a tetrahedron. The Bi occupies the center of the formed tetrahedron in the form of Bi2O. According to the Ostwald ripening mechanism [44], the crystal nucleus continues to grow, eventually forming a stable pyramid growing on the surface of the TiO2 nanofiber. When Pr(NO3)3 is simultaneously added to the reaction solution, Pr3+ and Bi3+ are aggregated around the TiO2 nanofibers by EDTA. Since the complexing ability of the rare earth ions (Pr3+) is stronger than that of the main group ions (Bi3+), the concentration of Pr3+ nearby the TiO2 nanofibers is much lower than that of Bi3+. Therefore, after adding Pr(NO3)3 to the system, Bi2Sn2O7 is still preferentially nucleated and grows continuously. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of Bi3+ ions decreases gradually and when this is reduced to a certain amount, Pr3+ begins to react with H2SnO3 in the solution to form a Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheet growing on the TiO2 nanofiber (Eq. (3)). Therefore, the amount of Pr(NO3)3 added has little effect on the formation of Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles, but has a significant effect on formation of Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheets. When the amount of Pr(NO3)3 is low, the nanosheets formed on the surface of the fibers are small in size. With an increasing amount of Pr(NO3)3 added, the number of nanosheets increases and they become larger. Finally, deformation, accumulation and independent nucleation occur on the TiO2 surface and a ternary composite is produced."
9,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis,"3.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis The XPS was used to characterize the surface element composition and chemical state of the sample. A full spectrum of XPS of the 3P-B/T sample shows elements such as Ti, Bi, O, Sn, Pr and C (Fig. 6 a). The element C is mainly due to the contamination of C from the detection instrument. A high-resolution XPS map of Ti shows peaks located at 464.2 and 458.6 eV, which are attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 6b), indicating that Ti is mainly in the form of Ti4+ [45]. Two asymmetric peaks of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 appear at 159.0 and 164.4 eV (Fig. 6c), indicating that Bi mainly exists in the form of Bi3+. After deconvolution, another two peaks appear at 159.7 and 165.0 eV and can be attributed to Bi5+, indicating that the Bi in the sample is present in both Bi3+ and Bi5+ states. The principle of electrical neutrality infers that oxygen vacancies exist in the sample [46], which will contribute to the improvement of its photocatalytic activity. The two photoelectron peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV coincide with Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 (Fig. 6d), which indicates that Sn is present as Sn4+ [47]. In high-resolution spectra of O1s (Fig. 6e), the peak at a high binding energy of 531.7 eV is attributed to surface chemisorbed oxygen (Oα), and the peak at a lower binding energy of 529.7 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen (Oβ) [48,49]. Among them, surface chemical adsorption of oxygen is the most active oxygen and plays an important role in the redox reaction. A high-resolution XPS spectrum of Pr3d is shown in Fig. 6f. After peak deconvolution, two symmetry peaks of Pr 3d5/2 and Pr 3d3/2 appear at the binding energies of 933.1 and 953.4 eV, respectively, indicating that Pr mainly exists as Pr3+ in the sample [50]."
10,Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) analysis,"3.6 Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) analysis The UV–vis DRS spectra of TiO2 and composite samples show that the absorption edge of the TiO2 nanofiber sample is at 387.5 nm (Fig. 7 ), which corresponds to the intrinsic absorption wavelength of anatase TiO2. This indicates that the TiO2 nanofiber can only be excited by UV light of wavelength less than 387.5 nm. For the binary composite, the absorption band edge of sample B/T can be extended to 468 nm, indicating that the incorporation of narrow band gap Bi2Sn2O7 significantly improves the light absorption of TiO2 nanofibers. For the ternary composites Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2, the positions of the absorption band edges slightly differ from each other. Sample 1P-B/T has relatively little influence on the light absorption range due to the relatively small amount of Pr2Sn2O7. The absorption band edge is around 460 nm, which is close to the B/T absorption band edge position. When the growth amount of Pr2Sn2O7 further increases, the absorption range narrows relative to the binary composite sample and the absorption band edge is blue-shifted to 420–430 nm. The reported wide band gap of Pr2Sn2O7 has a certain influence on absorption of TiO2/Bi2Sn2O7 composites. It is worth noting that the ternary composite sample exhibits several specific strong absorption peaks over a wider range of visible light absorption – these strong absorption peaks respectively appear at 443, 470, 483 and 582 nm (Fig. 7, inset). The absorption peaks of sample 3P-B/T are the most and the absorption intensity is the largest. Reports indicate that these special absorption peaks in ternary composite samples are mainly caused by the 4f–4f transition of Pr3+ in Pr2Sn2O7 crystal [51]. Therefore, with the increase of the loading of Pr2Sn2O7 in the system, the number of absorption peaks increases continuously."
11,Photoluminescence (PL) analysis,"3.7 Photoluminescence (PL) analysis The fluorescence intensity can directly reflect the recombination probability of electron–hole pairs [52,53]. Fluorescence emission spectra of TiO2 and composite photocatalysts (Fig. 8 ) show that the TiO2 nanofibers exhibit strong fluorescence, indicating that the photogenerated electrons and the holes generated under light irradiation are easily recombined. In comparison with TiO2 nanofibers, the fluorescence intensity of sample B/T is significantly reduced, indicating that Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 heterojunction better separates the photogenerated electrons in space and prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated electrons. On close comparison, the ternary composites show a trend of initial decrease followed by increases with the increasing amount of Pr2Sn2O7. The fluorescence intensity of sample 3P-B/T is the lowest, indicating its better photocatalytic ability."
12,Transient photocurrent analysis,"3.8 Transient photocurrent analysis The magnitude of photocurrent can directly reflect the degree of charge transfer of the sample, with the larger the photocurrent, the faster the charge transfer and the higher the photocatalytic activity. The transient photocurrent response curves for each sample (Fig. 9 ) show that the operation of turning on or cutting off the light source is performed once every 50 s. The tested electrodes have obvious photocurrent signals, indicating that the sample can be excited to photogenerate charges under illumination of the xenon lamp. The charge can be transferred to the electrode to produce a photocurrent. In theory, the photocurrent response intensity is usually positively correlated with the rate of hydrogen production. The transient photocurrent of the ternary composite sample is higher than that of the binary composite sample as well as of the TiO2 nanofiber (Fig. 9). The transient photocurrent intensity of the ternary composite sample initially increases and then decreases with the increase in Pr2Sn2O7 amount. The photocurrent intensity of sample 3P-B/T is the largest, in good agreement with the above PL analysis."
13,Photocatalytic production of hydrogen,"3.9 Photocatalytic production of hydrogen The photocatalytic decomposition of water under UV–vis light (λ ≥ 365 nm) and visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation is investigated over different samples. With CH3OH as a sacrificial agent, the average photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is shown in Fig. 10 a and b. The pure TiO2 nanofiber has low photocatalytic activity under UV–vis light and the average hydrogen production rate is only 82.6 μmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 10a). The results of fluorescence spectrum analysis and transient photocurrent tests show that the photogenerated electrons in TiO2 are extremely easy to recombine. Thus, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution is low. The Bi2Sn2O7 and Pr2Sn2O7 have significant effects on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanofibers. When TiO2 nanofibers are constructed with a certain amount of Bi2Sn2O7, the hydrogen production rate of sample B/T is 215.8 μmol h−1 g−1, about 2.6 times higher than that of TiO2. When Pr2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7 are simultaneously grown on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate is increased further. With the increase of Pr2Sn2O7 amount, the hydrogen production rate of the ternary composite photocatalyst sample initially increases and then decreases. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of sample 3P-B/T is the highest, with 587.1 μmol h−1 g−1, which is comparable to the reported value (see Table S1). The activity of 3P-B/T is 2.7 times that of binary composite sample B/T and 7.1 times that of TiO2. The AQE at 365 nm is approximately 26.45%. A comparison of photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation is shown in Fig. 10b. The TiO2 nanofibers show no hydrogen generation under visible light, consistent with the basic properties that wide bandgap semiconductors cannot be excited by visible light. The B/T, 1P-B/T, 2P-B/T, 3P-B/T and 4P-B/T composite samples show good photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under visible light. Once again, the variation of photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite is consistent with that under UV–vis light. The hydrogen production rate of sample 3P-B/T is still the highest, reaching 126.6 μmol h−1 g−1. The results of photocatalytic hydrogen production indicate that Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 single heterojunction can effectively enhance the activity of TiO2 for photocatalytic production of hydrogen. More importantly, by constructing a ternary composite of Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of TiO2 can be further improved. A five-cycle test of the TiO2, B/T and 3P-B/T was performed to verify stability of the photocatalyst (Fig. 11 ). With the increase in cycle numbers, the hydrogen production rates of the samples show different degrees of decrease. The activity loss of 3P-B/T and B/T is slightly higher than that of TiO2 nanofibers. This may be due to photocorrosion of Pr2Sn2O7 and Bi2Sn2O7 induced by light irradiation over a long time. To further explore the exact reason for the enhanced photocatalytic performance over P-B/T double heterojunction, experiments of radical trapping are performed under visible light and B/T employed for comparison. The radicals of O2 − and OH∙ are trapped by adding DMPO into the suspension of B/T or P-B/T powder. The B/T heterojunction can produce both O2 − and OH∙ under visible light irradiation (Fig. 12 a). Moreover, O2 − and OH∙ radicals are of the same intensity, indicating the comparable amount of these two kinds of radicals. The radicals can be solely produced by excitation of Bi2Sn2O7, because TiO2 is not active under visible light (Fig. 12b). In contrast, for the 3P-B/T sample, a stronger O2 − signal is observed and OH∙ can hardly be detected. This indicates that incorporation of Pr2Sn2O7 into Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 heterojunction can effectively promote formation of O2 − and inhibit formation of OH∙. It is believed that the selective production of O2 − over 3P-B/T results from the sacrifice of holes by photogenerated electrons over Pr2Sn2O7 and across TiO2 nanofibers. The photogenerated electrons over Pr2Sn2O7 are contributed by 4f–4f transitions from Pr3+. Accordingly, the band alignment of Pr2Sn2O7, Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2 can be deduced and is illustrated in Fig. 12c. On the basis of structural analysis and the structure-induced photocatalytic properties, the hydrogen production mechanism of the composite photocatalyst is tentatively proposed in Fig. 13 . Upon illumination, Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2 are excited by visible and UV light, respectively. The electrons in valence bands of Bi2Sn2O7 and TiO2 are transitioned to the conduction band to photogenerate electrons and holes. The photogenerated electrons on the side of TiO2 tend to recombine with the holes on the side of Bi2Sn2O7 via Z-scheme transfer. Moreover, construction of Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 heterojunction induces extension of TiO2 absorption to the visible light region and enhances the redox ability of electrons and holes, thus effectively overcoming the self-deficiency of low solar light utilization and poor photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Under visible light, Pr3+ in Pr2Sn2O7 can produce electrons via 4f–4f transition. When Pr2Sn2O7 is incorporated into Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2, the Z-scheme transfer of electrons is boosted. The one-dimensional structure of TiO2 nanofibers provides an ideal path for electron transfer from Pr2Sn2O7 to Bi2Sn2O7. Therefore, the double heterojunction exhibits higher activity toward hydrogen evolution than single heterojunction. When photocatalytic decomposition of water is performed using CH3OH as a sacrificial agent, the electrons aggregated in the conduction band of TiO2 can reduce H+ to H2. The photogenerated holes interact with water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the composite to form H+ and hydroxyl radicals (∙OH). The photogenerated holes and ∙OH react with CH3OH molecules to form HCHO, and further HCOOH. The HCOOH ionizes to form HCOO− and H+ in the system, wherein HCOO− is oxidized by holes to CO2 and H2O: (4) PBT + hν → H+ + e− (5) H2O + 2H+ → ∙OH + H+ (6) CH3OH + H+ → CH2OH∙ + H+ (7) CH2OH∙ + ∙OH → CH2(OH)2 (8) CH2(OH)2 → HCHO + H2O (9) HCHO + H2O + 2H+ → HCOOH + 2H+ (10) HCOOH → HCOO− + H+ (11) HCOO− + H+ → ∙CO2 − + H+ (12) CO2 − + H+ → CO2 (13) 2H+ + 2e− → H2"
14,Conclusions,"In this work, electrospun TiO2 nanofibers are employed as matrix and EDTA is used as adsorbent and chelating agent to prepare the double heterojunction Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 composite nanofiber. The Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 heterojunction extends the absorption of TiO2 to the visible region and promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The Pr2Sn2O7 nanosheets have a strong absorption in the visible region at 443, 470, 483 and 582 nm through 4f–4f transition of Pr3+ and generate excited electrons on the conduction band of Pr2Sn2O7. In the double heterojunction of Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2, TiO2 nanofibers facilitate transport of photogenerated electrons through the heterojunction interface between Pr2Sn2O7 and TiO2, and further transfer to Bi2Sn2O7 via the Z-scheme pathway. A significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution is observed due to the multiple advantages of double heterojunction, including extended visible absorption, promoted charge separation and enhanced redox ability of photogenerated charge-carriers. This study demonstrates that double heterojunction of Pr2Sn2O7@Bi2Sn2O7/TiO2 can effectively improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TiO2, which inspires activation of TiO2 via assembly of double heterojunction for enhanced visible-light-induced photocatalysis."
