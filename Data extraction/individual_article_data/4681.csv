0,Introduction,"After nearly a decade of development, the wind power installed capacity has made considerable progress in China. Since the problem of wind power integration has not been solved, a large number of wind power has not been effectively utilized. In terms of photovoltaic power generation, there is also the same problem as wind power, and the phenomenon of abandoning power is very serious. In 2015, over 60 billion kWh renewable electric energy was abandoned including 33.9 billion kWh accumulative wind power[1]. If it is used in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, the electric energy that can't be connected to the power grid can be converted into chemical energy. In addition, the content of CO2 in the atmosphere can be reduced, the greenhouse effect can be attenuated, and the liquid chemical fuel can be obtained. Although the prospect of electrochemical reduction of CO2 is attractive and has made some progress within the past decades, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 technology still faces many problems, such as low selectivity & activity, side reactions & low energy conversion efficiency, difficult separation of products and so on [2]. The products of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) through electrolysis had a direct relationship with the electrode materials. In the mid-1980s, Frese and Leach [3] found that Ru electrode could catalyze the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH, but the reduction current density was less than 1 mA/cm2. Subsequently, Hori et al. [4] found that CO2 can be reduced to CH4, C2H4, and alcohols in aqueous electrolytes at Cu electrode with high current density. So far, most of the metals towards CO2RR have been studied by various researchers. Hori [5] once divided bulk metals into four types according to the main reduction products: the first type produces HCOO−, such as Pb, Hg, Sn [6], Bi, In [7]; the second type produces CO, such as Au, Ag, Zn; the third type produces considerable hydrocarbons, only Cu; the fourth type produces only H2, such as Ni, Fe, Pt, Ti. According to the above four classifications, the hydrogen evolution potential of the first type of metals is high (that is, H2 needs to be generated at a more negative potential), but CO2 adsorption is weak, so CO2 tends to leave the electrode surface after combining with protons to generate HCOO−. The second type of metals has medium hydrogen evolution potential, but CO binding is weak, and once COads is generated, it tends to leave the electrode surface directly rather than continue hydrogenation. The third metal Cu is similar to the second metal, but its CO binding energy is higher, which is conducive to the hydrogenation of COads to produce hydrocarbons or organic compounds. The fourth type of metals has low hydrogen evolution potential and strong CO adsorption. After CO2 is reduced to CO, it is strongly adsorbed on the electrode surface, resulting in catalyst poisoning, so hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) dominates the electrolytic process [8]. Among all the existing catalysts, polycrystalline Cu is recognized as the only metal catalyst that can efficiently electrocatalyze CO2 to produce hydrocarbons. Kuhl et al. [9] found that the products are up to 16 types through polycrystalline Cu catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous phase. In addition to CO, HCOOH, CH4 and C2H4, there are also many alcohols, aldehydes, acids and so on. However, the lack of selectivity and stability hindered the practical application of Cu catalyst. In addition, due to the complexity of CO2 reduction process and the variety of products, the reaction mechanism and path are not clear, which also increases the blindness of catalyst design [10,11]. Therefore, further research on the mechanism of electrochemical reduction of CO2 on the surface of Cu based catalysts will help to design better catalysts, so as to promote the industrialization of electrochemical reduction of CO2 process [12]. Besides single metallic electrode, various composite catalysts were developed to promote the selectivity of certain products of electrocatalytic CO2RR. For example, a maximum Faraday's efficiency (FE) of 68% towards the generation of formate was observed with nitrogen doped porous carbon [13]. Moreover, top/bottom heterostructured SnO2/Sn could reach a FE value of 94% for formate and current density of 113.6 mA/cm2 at −1.18 V [14]. Besides formate, research efforts on novel carbonized copper metal organic framework derived electrodes demonstrated a FE value of over 72% for isopropanol [15]. In another case, high FEs of 69±5 and 77±2 % for C2H4 production can be achieved with ternary Cu-Au/Ag nanoframes in an H-cell and a flow cell, respectively [16]. On the contrary, Ag@Cu2O nanocells promoted the generation of CH4 with a FE of 74±2 % in the flow cell [17]. Furthermore, an ethanol's FE of 52 ± 1% was reported via suppression of deoxygenation by using NC/Cu catalyst [18]. Among all the possible products, CO is considered as one of the most promising candidates due to its high technological and economic feasibility [19]. Thus, one of the purposes of this research is to increase the selectivity of CO for the electrocatalytic CO2RR. The solubility of carbon dioxide in water is low, and thus the efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2RR is affected. In recent years, some researchers use pressurized method to increase the solubility of carbon dioxide in water, but the energy consumption of this method is relatively high [20]. For example, current densities as high as 163–700 mA/cm2 were observed at a pressure of 30 atm on various electrodes in an aqueous KHCO3 solution [21]. Alcohol amine is a colorless viscous liquid with hygroscopicity and ammonia odor. It is mainly used as absorbent for acidic gases (CO2, H2S and SO2). It has good adsorption and desorption for carbon dioxide. Different types of alcohol amine solutions have different adsorption and desorption capacities for carbon dioxide. The mixed alcohol amine solution of primary amine and tertiary amine can improve the circulation capacity and adsorption desorption rate of alcohol amine. In view of the low solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous solution, another research hypothesis of this study is to use alcohol amine solution to absorb CO2, improve its solubility in the electrolyte, and then improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2RR. At the same time, a new type of metal (Au or Cu) intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDHs) was developed as the electrode materials. The interlayer distance of LDHs is limited and thus may be beneficial for the formation of nano scale Au or Cu clusters. Moreover, LDHs has a good capacity for the adsorption of HCO3 −/CO3 2− or CO2, and thus might promote the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. In addition, physicochemical and electrochemical characterization was performed to reveal the characteristics of the as-prepared catalysts as well as the mechanism of CO2RR."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials Nafion solution D520 (5%) and acetylene black were bought from Fuel Cell Materials Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and KEJING Star Technology Co. Ltd. (Shenzhen, China), respectively. Potassium chloraurate (KAuCl4, 98%) was purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3), copper sulfate (CuSO4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA), ethanolamine (MEA), diethanol amine (DEA), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) of analytical grade were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). All of the chemicals were used as received without further purification, and distilled water from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was used as the solvent for all solutions."
3,LDHs synthesis and preparation of working electrode,"2.2 LDHs synthesis and preparation of working electrode LDHs were synthesized through a co-precipitation method similar to our previous research [22]. As shown in Fig. S1, MgAl-EDTA-LDH was prepared by using a co-precipitation method with salt solution A containing 0.75 mol/L MgSO4•7H2O & 0.125 mol/L Al2 (SO4)3•18H2O and alkaline solution B containing 1.6 mol/L NaOH and 0.5 mol/L [EDTA]2−. Both A and B were drop wisely added into 200 mL distilled water with a pH range of 8–11 at 80 °C while stirring violently during the whole procedure. After that, the suspension was slowly mixed and aged at 80 °C for 1 h, followed by filtration, subsequently washed with distilled water until neutral, and finally dried at 60 °C. Cu/MgAl-LDH was synthesized by adding 1.0 g MgAl-EDTA-LDH into 10 mL 0.01 mol/L CuSO4 solution, mixed at 80 °C for 2 h, washed with distilled water followed by filtration, and then dried at 60 °C for 10 h Before the synthesis of Au/MgAl-LDH, pristine MgAl-LDH was prepared through a similar co-precipitation method with 1.6 mol/L NaOH & 0.5 mol/L Na2CO3, and thus the interlayer anions were mainly CO3 2− instead of [EDTA]2−. [AuCl4]− was incorporated into MgAl-LDH through ion exchange process by mixing 10 mL 0.01 mol/L KAuCl4 solution with 0.5 g MgAl-LDH for 5 h at 80 °C, washed with distilled water, filtered and then dried at 60 °C for 10 h Subsequently, the working electrode was prepared according to a modified method described elsewhere [23]. To be brief, the ink mixture was prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of 5 mg Cu/MgAl-LDH (or Au/MgAl-LDH) and 3 mg acetylene black with 100 μL Nafion solution in 1 mL ethanol for 1.0 h Then 300 μL ink was loaded on the glassy carbon electrode followed by drying at 25 °C for 5 times, resulting in a catalyst content of 0.8 mg/cm2. The as-prepared working electrode was activated by potentiostatic electrolysis at −1.6 V (vs. SCE) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution for 2000s."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline structure of as-prepared catalysts was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Karlsruher, Germany) by using a Cu-Kα (λ=1.5418 Å) radiation at an operation voltage of 40 kV and an emission current of 40 mA from 5° to 80 ° with a scan rate of 2°/min. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss Sigma 500, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) was operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a working distance of 3.0 mm to characterize the morphological features of Au/MgAl-LDH and Cu/MgAl-LDH. The spectra of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR, PE Frontier, PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) was acquired in the reflection mode with a range of 4000–400 cm−1 for the measurement of functional groups. The distribution of Cu or Au in the catalyst was visualized by transmission electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (TEM-EDS, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption was performed with an automatic rapid specific surface area and mesoporous/microporous analyzer (ASAP 2460, Micrometrics, Atlanta, USA) at 77 K after degassing at 150 °C for 6 h The surface area and pore size distribution were calculated by using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, respectively. The percentage of target metals in catalysts was quantitatively determined through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Nexlon 300X, PerkinElmer, USA) after dissolving in mixed acid of 1:1 HCl and HNO3."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical tests were performed at room temperature of 25 ± 3 °C by using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai, China) and a three electrode system equipped with platinum, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and layered double hydroxides loaded on glassy carbon (LDHs/GC) as the counter, reference and working electrode, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in the 1.0 mmol/L K2Fe(CN)6 solution with various scan rates to calculate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Except CV tests, the other electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.5 M KHCO3 or 1.0 M alcohol amine [n(ethanolamine): n (diethanol amine) =2:3] solutions. Additional 0.5 M Na2SO4 was added to ensure the conductivity of the electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with 95% iR compensations at a scan rate of 50 mV/s to investigate the electrochemical activity of the as-prepared catalyst in Ar or CO2 saturated electrolyte, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured within the frequency range of 105–0.1 Hz with a 5.0 mV amplitude for Cu/MgAl-LDH & Au/MgAl-LDH, respectively. For the analysis of possible products and their corresponding Faraday's efficiencies, constant potential analysis were performed in H-type electrolytic reactor separated by anion exchange membrane (Nafion 117, Dupont, Wilmington, USA) with continuous CO2 purging at a flow rate of 10 mL/min."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis Gaseous products were analyzed through gas chromatograph (GC2008, Guangzheng Analytical Instrument Co. Ltd., Shenyang, China) equipped with a capillary column (GS-Gaspro, 60 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The GC-TCD program was set as following: 1 mL sample was injected in splitless mode with an oven temperature of 120 °C. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Liquid phase products were analyzed by a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker AVANCEIII 600 MHz system, Germany) after electrolysis. To make a sample, 60.0 μL D2O, 500.0 μL liquid phase products and 40.0 μL dimethyl sulfoxide (450 ppm aqueous solution) as internal standard were tested to quantify the products. The 1H spectrum was measured with water suppression."
7,Calculations,"2.6 Calculations The measured potential (vs. SCE) was converted to potential vs. reversible hydrogen potential (RHE) according to the Eq. (1). The Faraday's Efficiency (FEi) for the ith product (CO, CH4, HCOOH etc.) was calculated using Eq. (2), in which e, ni, F and Q referred to the number of electron required for the generation of 1 molecule of the ith product, total amount of ith product in moles, Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol) and the total passed charge (C) recorded by the electrochemical workstation, respectively. The total FE was calculated by adding all FEi for various products measured in both gaseous and aqueous phase. The ECSA was calculated through Randles-Sevick's method as shown in Eq. (3). (1) E RHE = E SCE + 0.0591 pH + E SCE Θ = E SCE + 0.0591 pH + 0.2415 V (2) F E i = e × n i × F / Q × 100 % (3) I p = 2 . 69 × 10 5 n 3 / 2 D 1 / 2 A v 1 / 2 C"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the as-prepared catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the as-prepared catalysts Copper (Cu2+) was incorporated into layered double hydroxides through chelation with MgAl-EDTA-LDH, while gold was interposed in the form of [AuCl4]− through ion exchange with the interlayered anions (such as CO3 2−, OH−) of MgAl-LDH. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the typical diffraction planes (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110) and (113) of MgAl-LDHs or Au/MgAl-LDHs can be observed at 2θs of 11.3°, 23.0°, 34.7°, 39.1°, 46.4°, 60.5° and 61.8°, respectively, which shifted about 0.6° from the standard quintinite-3T with a formula of Mg4Al2(OH)12CO3⋅3H2O (PDF card #51–1525). Those sharp peaks in the XRD patterns indicated ordered layered structure with high crystallinity of LDHs. The corresponding basal distance for (003) plane was 0.78 nm (d003 ) by using Bragg's equation, and no significant change was observed after the intercalation of gold. For MgAl-EDTA-LDH, the peaks shifted significantly towards low angles, which indicated the increasing the d spacing of the (003) reflection to 1.44 nm [24]. This trend was intensified for the sample of Cu/MgAl-LDH, which suggested the incorporation of [Cu(EDTA)]2− into the interlayer region of MgAl-LDH. In addition, the interlayer distance due to the intercalation of [Cu(EDTA)]2− could be calculated to be 0.98 nm by subtracting the average hydrotalcite-layer distance of 0.48 nm[25]. Moreover, the intensity of diffraction peaks became weaker, which can be attributed to the poor crystallinity of EDTA-LDHs. To identify the possible functional groups of the as-prepared catalysts, the FT-IR spectra of MgAl-LDHs, Au/MgAl-LDHs, MgAl-EDTA-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs were plotted as shown in Fig. 1(b), respectively. For all LDHs, the band at 3450–3480 cm−1, 1640–1655 cm−1, 1380–1400 cm−1 and 630–680 cm−1 can be attributed to the OH stretching vibration, bending vibration of H2O molecule, stretching & bending mode of CO3 2− group, and M-O stretching (M: Mg or Al), respectively [26]. The unique band near 1120 cm−1 for MgAl-EDTA-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs can be assigned to the CN vibration, which demonstrated the successful intercalation of EDTA2− anions [27]. Fig. S2 shows the representative SEM images of the as-prepared catalysts. The homogenous laminar structure of LDHs could be observed in Fig. S2 (a-d), and the intercalation didn't destroy the main LDHs’ framework, which was consistent with the previous XRD results. All the synthesized LDHs plates with ultrathin thicknesses were of high quality in terms of size and uniformity. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of Au/MgAl-LDH (a-b) and Cu/MgAl-LDH (e-f), respectively. Ultra thin laminar structure with a thickness less than 10 nm was observed for both samples, which was similar with the results of La/Ce doped CoFe layered double hydroxides [28]. Uneven dots were observed in Fig. 2(b), which might be caused by the accumulation of gold within the range of 5–20 nm. However, for the intercalation of copper, no such phenomenon was observed, which might be caused by the special synthetic method. EDTA2− was incorporated as the interlayer anion during the synthesis of MgAl-EDTA-LDH, and copper was introduced by chelation with EDTA2−, which typically attracted only one Cu2+ by the formation of coordination bond. HRTEM images (Fig. 2d and h) revealed a lattice stripe around 0.21 nm in the selected region electron diffraction (SAED), which corresponded to the (012) facets of LDHs. This results was consistent with the XRD patterns (2θ = 34.7°) and further proved the successful formation of LDHs [29]. Based on the EDS mapping results as shown in Fig. 3 , the molar ratio of Mg: Al was approximately 2:1 for the original MgAl-LDHs (a) and Au/MgAl-LDHs (b), which fell into the typical range of 2:1–4:1 for MgAl-LDH and was consistent with the XRD results. However, this ratio reduced to 1.3:1 and 1.7:1 for MgAl-EDTA-LDH (c) and Cu/MgAl-LDH (d), respectively, which might be ascribed to the coverage of EDTA on the surface. It was also interesting to note that the content of Cu was as high as 36.6% (mass%), which was 3.6 times higher than Au with a value of 10.5%. However, by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), it can be found that the mass content of Cu (21.3%) was similar to that of Au (15.6%). This phenomenon could be ascribed to the chelation of Cu with EDTA, which led to a higher coverage on the surface of the as-prepared catalyst. EDS mapping typical figured out the distribution of certain element near the surface rather than total percentage as shown in the results of ICP-MS. In addition, Cu (Fig. S3 d6) was much more evenly distributed on the surface of LDHs than that of Au (Fig. S3 b6), which was consistent with the results of TEM images as shown in Fig. 2 (b and f). Chelation with EDTA-LDH might be a better strategy than direct intercalation with metal coordination compounds such as [AuCl4]−. As shown in Table S1, the BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size were 43.1 m2/g, 0.4 cm3/g and 23.5 nm for the MgAl-LDHs, which kept almost unchanged after the intercalation of [AuCl4]−. However, significantly reductions of BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size to 3.8, 0.005 cm3/g and 5.5 nm were observed after the incorporation of EDTA. This might be explained by the fact that EDTA covered most of the surface and blocked the porous structure of LDHs. ECSA was frequently reported to have a more important impact on electrochemical activity than BET surface area. Thus Randles-Sevick's equation was adopted here by plotting Ip with the root of scan rates (ν1/2) as shown in Eq. (3), in which Ip, n, D, A, C and v were the anodic peak current, electron transfer number, diffusion coefficient, ECSA, concentration of K2Fe(CN)6 and scan rate, respectively [30]. In this case, n and D were 1 and 7.6 × 10−6 cm/s. As shown in Fig. S4, the ECSAs of Au/MgAl-LDH and Cu/MgAl-LDH were calculated to be 2.8 and 3.6 cm2, respectively, which were 1.6 and 2.0 times higher than geometric area of 1.8 cm2. As illustrated in Table 1 , no significant relationship was observed between ECSA and BET surface area in this study."
10,Electrochemical reduction of CO2 in KHCO3 solution,"3.2 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 in KHCO3 solution The performance of both Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 were analyzed by LSV measurements in the 0.5 M KHCO3 solution. As illustrated in Fig. 4 (a), both electrodes had a higher current response in CO2 than Ar saturated solution with onset potentials (defined at a current density of 1 mA/cm2) around −0.74 & −0.45 V (vs. RHE), respectively, which indicated a significant electrochemical activity towards CO2 reduction. To minimize the effect of different electrode areas, all the current responses were normalized to current densities by dividing specific ECSA by Randless-Sevick's method as shown in Fig. S4. The observed currents included both the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus the difference of current densities between the CO2 and Ar saturated solution at a specific potential (D-value) might indicate the activity of CO2 reduction reaction to some extent. It was obviously that Cu/MgAl-LDH owed a bigger D-value than Au/MgAl-LDH, which could be explained by higher content & activity of intercalated copper. In addition, the even distribution of copper in Cu/MgAl-LDHs might result in more active sites for the adsorption and reduction of CO2 than gold clusters in Au/MgAl-LDHs. EIS technique was also employed to investigate the charge transfer properties of various catalysts. Fig. 4(b) shows the representative Nyquists plots of MgAl-LDHs, MgAl-EDTA-LDHs, Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs in the 0.5 M KHCO3 solutions, respectively. According to the equivalent circuit with a solution resistance (R1) followed by a phase element (CPE1) and charge transfer resistance (R2) in parallel, the EIS results were modelled with a computer software package. Depressed circles were observed at high frequency, which implied that charge transfer process controlled the impedance. The results showed that the raw MgAl-LDHs had a very high charge transfer resistance (R2) of 8352 Ω/cm2, and the intercalation of EDTA can reduce this value to 6491 Ω/cm2. Moreover, R2 values of Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs were significantly reduced to 56 and 48 Ω/cm2, respectively, which might indicate the successful intercalation and reduction of gold or copper. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), the chronoamperometry test showed that both Cu/MgAl-LDH and Au/MgAl-LDH showed a stable catalytic ability towards CO2RR within the experimental conditions. The slight decrease of current densities with time might be ascribled to the termination of double layer charging and the blocking of the active sites by the intermediates. To verify the products for CO2 reduction, constant-potential electrolysis was performed with continuous CO2 purging at a flow rate of 10 mL/min in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution with Au/MgAl-LDH and Cu/MgAl-LDH, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(e), CO and H2 were the main products by using Au/MgAl-LDHs. The generation of liquid products were negligible from the NMR analysis shown in Fig. S5. The FE(H2) increased remarkably when the applied potential shifted towards the negative position, while FE(CO) first increased and then decreased due to the competition of hydrogen evolution reaction. As for Cu/MgAl-LDHs in Fig. 4(f), CH4, CO and H2 were detected in the gaseous phase accompanied with HCOOH from NMR results of Fig. S6. Both FE(H2) and FE(CO) increased with the applied potential while FE(HCOOH) showed a reverse trend within the range of −0.30 V ∼ −0.50 V (vs. RHE). Volcanic relationship was observed between FE(CH4) and the applied potential. Total FE of all products was less than 100%, which might be explained by the generation of black elemental carbon on the electrode surface."
11,Electrochemical reduction of CO2 in alcohol amine solution,"3.3 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 in alcohol amine solution Electrolytic reduction of CO2 was usually limited due to its low solubility as well as slow mass transfer efficiency in water. Pressurized electrolysis was adopted in some research which can significantly enhanced the CO2 reduction with high energy consumption [31]. Therefore, a new strategy of electrolysis in alcohol amine solution was employed in this research to strengthen absorption of CO2 so as to intensify CO2RR without increasing energy consumption. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the onset potentials of Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs were around −0.36 & −0.25 V (vs. RHE) for CO2RR in 1.0 M alcohol amine solution, which shifted towards positive direction compared with KHCO3 solution and indicated an enhanced electrochemical activity towards CO2 reduction. This result was similar to the reduction of CO2 on the surface of nanowires, nanosheets or nanoflowers of copper with an onset potential around −0.3 V, which was significant superior than copper foam with a more negative onset potential of −0.65 V [32]. Alcohol amine solution had a higher absorption capacity for CO2 than KHCO3 solution, and thus was beneficial for CO2RR [33]. As shown in Fig. 5(b), EIS was performed to determine the electron transfer capacity of various electrode materials in the range of 0.1–100 kHz with a 5.0 mV amplitude. Similar to the results in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution, MgAl-LDHs had a very high charge transfer resistance (R2) of 8458 Ω/cm2, and the intercalation of EDTA can reduce this value to 7678 Ω/cm2. After intercalation of gold or copper, R2 values of Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs were significantly reduced to 64 and 55 Ω/cm2, respectively, which led to an excellent catalytic efficiency. Fig. 5(c) & (d) shows the i-t curves of CO2RR under −0.25 ∼ −0.55 V (vs. RHE) with Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs in 1.0 M alcohol amine solution, respectively. All the currents decreased quickly at the beginning and reached steady state after 2.0 h, which was significantly prolonged when compared with KHCO3 solution. This phenomenon might be explained by the absorption of large amount of CO2 in alcohol amine solution, which was reduced during electrolysis. Moreover, all the currents at steady-state increased significantly with the applied potential, which can be explained with the fact that the activation of CO2 needs a large activation energy and thus a big overpotential. In addition, the HER process was enhanced as well when the applied potential moved towards the negative direction. However, HER was preferred on the surface of Cu/MgAl-LDH under negative potential than Au/MgAl-LDH since FE(H2) increased more significantly as shown in Fig. 5(f). Similarly, the products for CO2 reduction by Au/MgAl-LDH and Cu/MgAl-LDH in 1.0 M alcohol amine solution were verified through constant potential electrolysis as shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f), the Faraday's Efficiencies (FE) for gaseous products were almost 100%, and no liquid products were detected by using NMR of Figs. S7 and S8. For Au/MgAl-LDHs, both FE(H2) & FE(CO) change slowly when the applied potential was set within the range of −0.35 ∼ −0.60 V (vs. RHE). This phenomenon might be explained by the low catalytic efficiency towards HER of Au/MgAl-LDHs. However, FE(CO) decreased more quickly and FE(H2) increased as a result on the surface of Cu/MgAl-LDHs when the potential went towards the negative direction. In addition, the FE(H2) in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution was 1–2 times higher than alcohol amine solution under similar conditions due to the depression of HER by high pH of 10. Moreover, high pH impeded the further hydrogenation of COads and thus reduced the generation of other products."
12,Discussion,"3.4 Discussion Direct electrochemical reactions usually take place on the surface of various electrodes, and thus the adsorption of CO2 is critical for the electrochemical reduction process. Based on the previous research, both computational and experimental studies proved that pristine or modified ZnAl-LDH, MgAl-LDH, CaAl-LDH and MgAl-LDH all had excellent ability to capture CO2 from surrounding environment [34–36]. Moreover, the adsorption energy of CO2 on Au8/mono LDHs was calculated to be −2.31 eV based on density functional theory (DFT), which was 10 times than that of mono LDHs [34]. Thus LDH based materials was an excellent catalyst for CO2RR process. In previous research, CO2 and H2O were both observed to participate in CO2RR through in situ attenuated-total-reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy [37]. Thus electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a complex process involving multi-step electron transfer, which involves the reduction of H2O to [H] and thus generally competes with HER. As shown in Fig. 6 , CO2∙− was generated through a faster pre-equilibrium process involving one electron transfer followed by a slower rate-determining reaction to from ∙CO2H [38]. Further hydrogenation generally leads to the generation of formic acid (HCOOH), and in the opposite carbon monoxide (CO) is formed if one molecule water (H2O) is dehydrated at the same time. The standard redox potential is −0.53 V (vs. SHE) theoretically for electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO [15]. Deng et al. confirmed CO production from HCO3 − on both Au and Cu electrode through in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy [39]. The other product with 2 electrons transfer is HCOOH, which has a lower standard reaction potential of −0.43 V (vs. SHE). Methane (CH4) is produced after successive addition of [H], which needs 8 electrons with a standard reaction potential of −0.25 V (vs. SHE). During electrolysis, gold can form coordination bond with CO by using outer 6 s or 6p orbital, and thus the binding energy is commonly recognized as very low. The generated COads prefers to leave the electrode surface immediately after formation. On the contrary, copper usually forms coordination bond with CO by using 4 s or 4p orbital, and the binding energy is higher than gold. Thus COads cannot leave the active sites easily and further hydrogenation was observed in KHCO3 solution with multi electrons transfer, leading to the generation of a variety of final products such as HCOOH and CH4 besides CO. Moreover, MgAl-LDHs might serve as the carrier for nano scale gold or copper as well as the adsorbent of CO3 2−/CO2/HCO3 −, which enhanced the mass transfer and provides active sites for electrocatalytic CO2RR. It was also worth to note that one previous research showed that the synergetic effect between the exposed Cu facets and carbon substrate could lead to high activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2RR [40]. Compared with KHCO3 solution, alcohol amine solution is an excellent absorbent for CO2 and thus gives high reduction rate without adding high pressure as shown in Eqs. (4) and (5), which was verified by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy [41]. It was also interesting to note that Shu et al. once pointed out Cu had a poor ability to produce CO through operando surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopic analysis [42]. This research provided an alternative way to enhance the production of CO by adding alcohol amine. (4) 2 RN H 2 + C O 2 → RNHCO O − + RN H 3 + (5) RNHCO O − + 2 H + 2 e − → RN H 2 + CO + O H −"
13,Conclusion,"Electrochemical reduction of CO2 was successfully observed on the surface of as-prepared Au/MgAl-LDHs and Cu/MgAl-LDHs. Due to the incorporation of EDTA, copper (21.3%) was found to be distributed more evenly than gold (15.6%). Larger ECSA and smaller BET surface area was found for Cu/MgAl-LDHs over Au/MgAl-LDHs though they had a similar geometric area. By using LSV measurements, both catalysts were found to be effective for electrochemical reduction of CO2 in the KHCO3 and alcohol amine solutions. For Au/MgAl-LDHs, the main products were measured to be CO and H2, and H2 was preferred at more negative potentials. For Cu/MgAl-LDHs, higher current response and similar products were observed in alcohol amine solution. In KHCO3 solutions, CH4 and HCOOH were found to be the additional products besides CO and H2, which might be explained by the fact that KHCO3 solutions with a pH value of 8 could provide more protons for the further reduction of CO2."
