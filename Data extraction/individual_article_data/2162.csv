0,Introduction,"Due to the combustion of fossil fuels that generates environmental pollution and results in climate change, humankind faces the challenge of implementing efficient alternative energy sources, which would underpin the establishment of a sustainable and cleaner energy system. Biomass is one of the most abundant renewable energy sources on earth and can provide energy carriers called biofuels. Currently bioethanol and biodiesel are commercially available for the transportation sector in Brazil, USA, China, India, and EU, displacing fossil fuels in these markets. However, these first generation biofuels compete with food production, generate pollution and reduced biodiversity from pesticide use, and increase CO2 emissions due to use-of-land changes (Fargione et al., 2008). Biofuel production from residual biomass is more sustainable. Mexico has vast cultivation of Agave tequilana Weber Var. Azul for tequila production (Hernández-Salas et al., 2009). In 2015 the consumption of agave for this industry was estimated at 859,000 tons (Tequila Regulatory Council, 2015), approximately 40% of it is discarded as residual bagasse during tequila production (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2016), generating environmental problems. This bagasse comprises 43% cellulose, 19% hemicellulose and 15% lignin (Hernández-Salas et al., 2009) and has great potential for biofuels production because of its high content of fermentable sugars, 21.3% of xylan and 40.5% of glucan (Perez-Pimienta et al., 2016), which can be released through a depolymerization process called hydrolysis. Acid hydrolysis is the most widely used and efficient method to release the sugars, however acid hydrolysis can produce toxic compounds such as hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2016). In the case of agave bagasse, which indirectly undergoes a pretreatment (cooking 100 °C for 24 h and grinding) during tequila production process, an enzymatic hydrolysis can be applied directly to bagasse as reported by Arreola-Vargas et al. (2016) and Contreras-Dávila et al. (2017); the advantage is that no toxic compounds are formed. Lignocellulose hydrolysates contain glucose, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, lignin fragments, among others (Haroun et al., 2016; Baêta et al., 2016). This complex mixture can be metabolized by microbial consortiums involved in dark fermentation for hydrogen production. Dark fermentation has faster metabolic rates and lower operational requirements, but has low H2 yields due to the incomplete degradation of wastes and to the accumulation of acids, limiting the yield to less than 20% of the theoretical value (Kim and Kim, 2013). To overcome these drawbacks, a two-stage fermentation process has been proposed: acidogenesis (dark fermentation) + methanogenesis (Nualsri et al., 2016a). In the acidogenesis phase, organic compounds are converted to hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFAs); in the methanogenesis phase the VFAs are converted to methane, improving both energy recovery and COD removal. In the case of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, there are few studies and most of them have been carried out in batch conditions (Kumari and Das, 2015; Baêta et al., 2016; Arreola-Vargas et al., 2016). Studies on continuous two-stage process energy production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates are still scarce and most of them have used long HRT, possibly due to the complexity of the lignocellulosic residues (Haroun et al., 2016), obtaining low volumetric production rates (Kongjan et al., 2011; Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2015). The VHPR and VMPR can be significantly enhanced by an appropriate selection of operational conditions such as HRT and OLR in continuous processes. However, little is known about the effect of these conditions on the hydrogen and methane production from lignocellulosic residues. Reports on the use of agave bagasse for hydrogen and methane production are very recent. Arreola-Vargas et al. (2015) used for the first time an acid agave bagasse hydrolyzate for methane production in batch, obtaining a yield of 70% and low VMPR (0.3 L CH4/L-d). Subsequently they carried out in batch two-stage anaerobic digestion of an enzymatic Agave tequilana bagasse hydrolysate, for the first-stage they obtained 2.4 L H2/L-d and for the second-stage 0.96 L CH4/L-d. Regarding continuous processes, only Contreras-Dávila et al. (2017) have used an enzymatic agave bagasse hydrolyzate for hydrogen production in a CSTR obtaining a VHPR of 2.53 L H2/L-d. To the best of our knowledge, agave bagasse hydrolysates have not been tested in continuous two-stage process. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the continuous production of hydrogen and methane from agave bagasse enzymatic hydrolysate in a two-stage anaerobic digestion process (acidogenesis + methanogenesis); the influence of the OLR and stirring speed on the hydrogen production in a CSTR, and OLR and HTR on methane production in UASB reactor, were evaluated to improve production rates and energy recovery."
1,Material and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum Anaerobic granular sludge from a full-scale UASB reactor treating tequila vinasses from Casa Herradura (Amatitan, Jalisco, México) was used as inoculum. To favor hydrogen producing spore-forming microorganisms, the inoculum was thermally treated at 104 °C during 24 h, ground in a mortar and sieved with a mesh of 850 μm as reported by Buitrón and Carvajal (2010). The powder obtained was used as inoculum in the CSTR. For the methanogenesis, the inoculum was used without any treatment such as it was collected from the UASB reactor."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate 2.2.1 Agave bagasse hydrolysate The Agave tequilana bagasse was obtained from Casa Herradura (Amatitan, Jalisco, México). The dry bagasse was ground to obtain fibers with lengths between 0.5 and 4 cm and then it was subjected to three washes with water for 1 h under mechanical stirring to remove residual sugars and soluble substances from the tequila production process. Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out by dispersing 3.5% (w/v) of the dry bagasse in 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 5.5, then Celluclast® 1.5 L (Novozymes, Denmark) was added at a load corresponding to 18 filter paper units (FPU)/g bagasse or 0.7 mg protein/g bagasse, as reported by Lopez-Gutierrez (2015), the mixture was incubated at 40 °C and 100 rpm for 12 h. The hydrolysates were filtered through absorbent gauze cloth and the supernatants were preserved at 4 °C before use. Several enzymatic hydrolysis batches were prepared and used within 24 h. Cellulase activity was determined as FPU per milliliter, as recommended by Adney and Baker (2008). Enzyme activity for Celluclast® 1.5 L was 36.3 FPU/mL. The contribution of each component to the CODtotal of agave hydrolyzate was calculated. The COD of the citrate buffer and the COD of Celluclast® 1.5 L were determined experimentally and separately; in the hydrolyzate the total carbohydrates concentration was measured and this was expressed as COD. Finally the COD of other components (solids, oligomers and lignin fragments) was calculated by subtracting the sum of the COD from the buffer, enzyme and carbohydrates to the CODtotal."
4,Continuous hydrogen production in a CSTR,"2.3 Continuous hydrogen production in a CSTR Hydrogen production was carried out in an Applikon stirred tank reactor (model Z310210011), with a working volume of 1 L, equipped with a thermal jacket and pH, temperature, oxidation-reduction potential sensors. The reactor was initially stirred at a rate of 150 rpm, the temperature was kept at 35 °C and the pH was automatically controlled at 5.5 with NaOH 4 M. The reactor was inoculated with 4.5 g volatile solids (VS)/L of heat-treated anaerobic granular sludge powder. To attain an anaerobic environment, the reactor was flushed with CO2/N2 mixture gas for 10 min before the start-up. The reactor was initially operated for 16 h in batch mode; afterwards the system was switched to continuous mode. The influent was the bagasse hydrolysate described in Section 2.2 supplemented with mineral salts according to Contreras-Dávila et al. (2017). Different OLR between 40 and 52 g COD/L-d, as specified in Table 1 , were achieved in this study by varying hydrolysate concentration. Different stirring speeds were also evaluated: 150, 180, 200, 250, and 300 rpm. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) was maintained at 6 h. The process was considered to be in steady state when the variation of gas production was less than 10% for 3 days. The H2 content in the biogas, VHPR, VFAs production, COD removal, total sugar removal and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured during the reactor operation. The effluent was collected, decanted and preserved at 0 °C for later use in the methanogenesis phase."
5,Continuous methane production in a UASB reactor,"2.4 Continuous methane production in a UASB reactor The UASB reactor used for methane production had a working volume of 1.25 L (total volume of 1.5 L). This reactor was inoculated with 20 g VS/L of the methanogenic granular sludge; the acetoclastic methanogenic activity of the anaerobic granular sludge was 0.36 g COD-CH4/g VSS-d. The acidogenic effluent generated during hydrogen fermentation of bagasse hydrolysate in the CSTR, which contained in average 5.4 ± 0.5 g VFAs/L, 10.2 ± 0.9 g CODtotal/L, 0.9 ± 0.2 g TSS/L, 0.32 ± 0.03 g carbohydrates/L and pH 5.5, was used as substrate of the UASB reactor. The acidogenic effluent was diluted and supplemented with mineral salts before being fed to the UASB reactor. Each liter of influent fed to the UASB reactor contained (in g/L): K2HPO4, 0.250; NH4Cl, 0.280; MgCl2·6H2O, 0.83; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.010; yeast extract, 0.1, and trace element solution, 1 mL. Trace element solution contained (in g/L): EDTA, 1.0; FeCl2·4H2O, 2.0; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5; H3BO3, 0.05; ZnCl2, 0.05; NaMoO4·2H2O, 0.036; AlCl3·6H2O, 0.09; NiCl3·6H2O, 0.93; CoCl2·6H2O, 2; CuCl2·2H2O, 0.09; NaSeO3·10H2O, 0.227; HCl, 1.19. NaHCO3 was added to the acidogenic effluent to maintain the pH at 7 during the first 30 days of operation. For the start-up, the reactor was fed with 1 g COD of effluent collected from the CSTR and operated in batch mode for 24 h. Afterwards, the UASB reactor was operated in continuous mode at an HRT of 21 h and room temperature (23–25 °C). The operating temperature was selected based on the work of Cota-Navarro et al. (2011). To evaluate the effect of the OLR on the VMPR, the OLR was gradually augmented by increasing the COD concentration of the influent and then by decreasing the HRT up to 14 h (Table 3 ). The reactor was operated during 80 days, in nine different periods to achieve OLR between 1.35 and 24 g COD/L-d. The process was considered to be in steady state when the VMPR variation was less than 5% during 5 days. The performance of the UASB was assessed by measurement of biogas composition, VMPR, methane yield (MY), inlet and outlet pH, alkalinity, COD and VFAs removal."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The concentration of methane and hydrogen was determined by TCD gas chromatography (GC, 6890N Network GC System, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) with a Hayesep D (Alltech, Illinois, USA) column, 10′ × 1.8″ × 0.085″. Nitrogen was the carrier gas, the temperature of the injection port, furnace and detector were 250 °C, 60 °C and 250 °C, respectively. Gas production, in both reactors, was measured by a liquid displacement device (SEV. Puebla, México); all gas data are reported at 273.15 K and 1 atm. COD, total suspended solids (TSS), VSS and alkalinity were determined by standard methods (APHA-AWWA-WPCF, 1992). Total sugars were determined by the phenol–sulfuric method (Dubois et al., 1956). VFAs concentration was determined using capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 1600A, Waldbronn, Germany) with a basic anion buffer (Agilent pH 12.1) and a silica capillary column (Agilent, id = 50 mm, L = 80.5 cm, length effective = 72 cm). The temperature and voltage were 25 °C and −30 kV, respectively. The samples were injected at a pressure of 300 mbar for 6 s. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were determined with a Shimadzu TOC-V analyzer."
7,Calculations,"2.6 Calculations The theoretical expected hydrogen production and the acetic acid produced from homoacetogenesis were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) as previously proposed by Luo et al. (2011a): (1) H 2 − theoretical = 2 [ Butyric acid ] + 2 [ Acetic acid ] − [ Propionic acid ] (2) Acetic homoacetogenesis = ( 2 [ Butyric acid ] + 2 [ Acetic acid ] − [ Propionic acid ] − [ H 2 ] ) / 6 where [Butyric acid], [Acetic acid], [Propionic acid] and [H2] are the measured butyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and hydrogen concentrations in mM, respectively. The COD balance expressed as CODrecovery of the hydrogen process was calculated as follows: (3) COD recovery % = ( CODt final / CODt initial ) ∗ 100 where CODt initial is the COD of agave bagasse hydrolysate fed and CODt final is the sum of the mass, expressed as g COD, of every component of the acidogenic effluent and of the hydrogen produced in each period. The methane yield of the methanogenic process, with respect to the theoretical one if all the COD was transformed to methane, was calculated as follows: (4) CH 4 yield % = ( ( L biogas produced ) ( % methane in biogas ) / ( g COD feed ) ( 0.35 L CH 4 / g COD ) ) ∗ 100 The COD removal efficiency in the UASB reactor was calculated from the soluble COD in the effluent and the total COD in the acidogenic effluent used to feed the methanogenic reactor. The energy recovery was estimated in terms of hydrogen and methane energy equivalents, (12.8 and 35.8 kJ/L, respectively) and the calorific value of the agave bagasse of 16.35 kJ/g bagasse reported by Liñan-Montes et al. (2014)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Enzymatic hydrolysate from agave bagasse,"3.1 Enzymatic hydrolysate from agave bagasse The agave bagasse hydrolysate used as substrate for hydrogen production had on average 27.2 ± 1.5 and 25 ± 0.9 g/L of CODtotal and CODsoluble, respectively; 5.3 ± 0.8 g/L of total sugars and a C/N ratio of 39. The total sugars contained in the hydrolysate contributed to 20% of the CODtotal, citrate buffer with 26%, Celluclast with 38% and other not determined components 16%. Similar sugar proportions in terms of the hydrolysates COD has been previously reported for enzymatic hydrolysates of oat straw (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2015) and agave bagasse (Contreras-Dávila et al., 2017) obtained with Celluclast® 1.5 L."
10,Biohydrogen production in the CSTR,"3.2 Biohydrogen production in the CSTR The CSTR was operated during 84 days in fifteen periods, under the conditions showed in Table 1. The performance of the CSTR is shown in Fig. 1 . In the first days of operation the reactor had an unstable behavior as can be seen by the VHPR and the fluctuation of the H2 percentage in the gas. After day 7, VHPR values keep around 4 L H2/L-d and a H2 content of 55%. The OLR was then increased to 44 and 48 g COD/L-d (periods 2 and 3), resulting in the increment of the VHPR. However, a further increment in the OLR to 52 g COD/L-d provoked a fast reduction of both the gas production and the H2 content in the gas. The first option to recover the H2 production was decreasing the OLR, however, it can be observed in Fig. 1A (days 28–34) that there was no positive effect. In these days, the measured hydrogen was only 22% of the theoretical H2 production (Table 1), a low H2 concentration in the gas was observed and the VFAs analysis revealed an increase in the concentration of acetic acid (Fig. 1B). This last effect was probably due to a homoacetogenesis process involving H2 and CO2 consumption. Acetate in the hydrogen fermentation systems can be produced by acidogenesis (Eq. (5)) and homoacetogenesis (Eq. (6)), besides acetogenesis might occur in microbial carbohydrates degradation (Eq. (7)), competing with hydrogen production (Arooj et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2011a,b). (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 (6) 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O (7) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 CH 3 COOH From Eq. (5) is known that two mol of hydrogen are produced together with 1 mol of acetate; therefore, once the moles of hydrogen produced experimentally are determined, it is possible to know the moles of acetic acid produced from acidogenesis. By determining acetic acid concentration in the reactor, it was found an excess of it with respect to what it should have been produced according to the stoichiometry of Eq. (5). This excess acetic acid together with the decrease of the hydrogen concentration in the gas and the low hydrogen production (Fig. 1) are strong evidences that acetic acid was being produced by homoacetogenesis. The acetic acid produced from homoacetogenesis was calculated using Eq. (2) (Luo et al., 2011a) and the results are shown in Table 2. The amount of acetic acid from homoacetogenesis coincided for above 90% with the excess acetic acid, the rest (less than 10%) could come from Eq. (7) as reported by Kim et al. (2006). Hydrogen consumption could also be due to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but methane was not detected in this period. Within the reactions that are carried out in anaerobic digestion the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is thermodynamically more favorable than homoacetogenesis, however when methanogenesis is inhibited the homoacetogenesis takes place (Luo et al., 2011a; Xu et al., 2010). In this study the homoacetogenesis was favored, because the low pH (5.5) and HRT of 6 h were enough to inhibit methanogenesis (no methane was detected during the whole reactor operation). The major soluble metabolites were acetic and butyric acid, whereas propionic acid was not detected. COD mass balances including hydrogen gas, VFAs, biomass and residual sugars were in the range of 88–105% (Table 1), which showed that most of the COD was recovered in the various fermentation metabolites that were quantified. However, the CODrecovery in periods 4 and 14, where the OLR was 52 g COD/L-d, were slightly lower (85 and 88%, respectively) than in the other periods, which could be due to the production of metabolites that were not quantified. It has been reported that when the level of acetate increases, which was the case for these two periods, alcohols like ethanol and butanol can be produced (Clark et al., 2012). Hydrogen accumulation is another factor that favors homoacetogenesis (Xu et al., 2010). When the dissolved hydrogen reaches a critical concentration (partial pressure of 60 Pa), bacterial metabolism shifts from the production of maximum H2 yields to other metabolic pathways that can affect hydrogen production. Hydrogen may accumulate in the liquid medium by the unfavorable mixing state of the culture, precluding gas transfer from the liquid to the gas phase (Beckers et al., 2015). Therefore, during our experiment, the increase in the agitation speed maintaining a constant OLR of 44 g COD/L-d was implemented as a strategy to release the hydrogen gas from the liquid phase and avoid its consumption by homoacetogens (periods 6–10). In Fig. 1A and B it can be observed that the strategy of increasing the stirring speed (from 150 to 300 rpm) favored both the VHPR and H2 content in the gas phase; for example from 3 L H2/L-d in period 6 at 150 rpm to 6 L H2/L-d in period 10 at 300 rpm. The hydrogen content in the gas was 43% in period 6 and 55% in period 10, indicating that the increase of the stirring speed improved the transfer of dissolved H2 from the liquid to the reactor gas phase. Table 2 shows the COD balances for periods 6–10. In period 6, the COD drive to acetic acid production was 34%, whereas in period 10, the increase in stirring speed reduced the COD drive to acetic acid up to 26% and increased the COD drive to hydrogen production from 5 to 9%. Regarding acetic acid, 38% of the acetic acid was produced from homoacetogenesis in period 6, whereas this percentage was reduced to 29% in period 10. The reduction of the homoacetogenesis, achieved by the depletion of hydrogen in the liquid phase, helped to increase the H2 yield from 22% in period 6, to 45% in period 10 (see Table 1). In other periods the acetic acid from homoacetogenesis remained between 29 and 30%, which indicates that homoacetogenesis was always present and that the increase in agitation helped to control it, but not to eradicate it. Thermophilic conditions may be used to eliminate homoacetogenesis (Luo et al., 2011a). Once the VHPR was recovered, the OLR was increased to 48 g COD/L-d (period 11) but the hydrogen production decreased due to a failure in the reactor causing cell wash-out. The reactor was reestablished at an OLR of 44 g COD/L-d during period 12. In period 14 the OLR was increased again to 52 g COD/L-d but the VHPR decreased again, indicating that the reactor reached its OLR limit. Finally, the VHPR was quickly reestablished during period 15, when the OLR was lowered to 44 g COD/L-d. These observations are in agreement with those reported by Contreras-Dávila et al. (2017), who also used an enzymatic hydrolysate of agave bagasse as substrate, reporting that hydrogen production decreased drastically at OLR above 52 g COD/L-d. In the period 6 at the same OLR, but with 150 rpm, the fall in VHPR was very pronounced since the first day, however in period 14 with 300 rpm the VHPR started to descend after 3 days but, when the OLR was lowered to 44 g COD/L-d, the VHPR was quickly reestablished during period 15. Apparently an improvement in mass transfer by high stirring speed avoided the hydrogen consumption allowing the reestablishment of the VHPR when the OLR was reduced. The VHPR of 6 L H2/L-d obtained in this study during the CSTR operation at an OLR of 44 g COD/L-d and stirring speed of 300 rpm was 2.4 times greater (2.23 L H2/L-d) than the one reported by Contreras-Dávila et al. (2017), using the same OLR in a CSTR. The lower hydrogen production that they obtained can be attributed to both the presence of lactate and propionate, which are hydrogen sinks, and low hydrogen concentration in the gas phase (35%). The cause of this last one could be mass transfer limitations of the system, since they used agitation by recirculation at a flow rate of 8 L/min."
11,Methane production,"3.3 Methane production The UASB reactor for methane production was fed with the acidogenic effluent collected from the CSTR and operated during 80 days in nine periods under different OLR and HRT. The OLR was gradually augmented by increasing the concentration of the influent and then by decreasing the HRT (Table 3). The performance of the UASB reactor is shown in Fig. 2 and the operational details are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that methane production increased gradually with the increase of the OLR, as shown in Fig. 2A. During periods 1–6 the operation and performance of the reactor was as expected, with the gradual increase of the COD removal efficiency from 62 to 90% (in periods 1 and 6, respectively) and the increase in methane yields from 60% to 90%. When the OLR was increased up to 20 g COD/L-d with the decrease of the HRT to 14 h (period 7), a VMPR of 6.4 L CH4/L-d and methane yield of 90% were obtained. A further increase of the OLR to 24 g COD/L-d (period 8) with a decrease of the HRT to 10 h, produced a 10% reduction of the methane yield, therefore, in order to maintain the yields around 90%, the OLR of 20 g COD/L-d was reestablished, with the increase in the HRT to 14 h, in period 9 (Fig. 2A and B). Fig. 2B shows that for each OLR increase there was a slight drop in methane yield, probably due to the time taken for the microorganisms present to adapt to the new substrate concentration. Only methane and carbon dioxide were detected in the biogas, the methane content remained between 70 and 76% (Table 3). From period 3 onwards, the COD removal efficiencies were above 90% (Fig. 2B). The VFAs removal was higher than 95%, revealing an effective conversion of VFAs to methane (data not shown). The desirable pH range for methanogenesis in a two-step anaerobic digestion process is between 7 and 8 (Kongjan et al., 2011). In this study, the influent of the UASB reactor was supplemented initially with bicarbonate to neutralize the pH to 7. After 30 days of operation, no more bicarbonate was added because pH was 7.5 ± 0.3 without pH control; the alkalinity gradually increased from 3.0 to 4.8 g CaCO3/L (Fig. 2C). Both results were due to the VFAs consumption, which is also indicative of the stability of the methanogenic process. The methane production rates obtained in periods 7 and 9 (6.4 L CH4/L-d) were higher compared to values reported in literature. Nualsri et al. (2016a) and Jung et al. (2012) used a hydrogenogenic effluent from a CSTR to feed an UASB reactor for methane production obtaining 2.25 and 2.06 L CH4/L-d, respectively, which are nearly three times lower than this work. A result probably due to the low OLR (<5 g COD/L-d) and the long HTR (72–48 h) employed by these authors."
12,Energy recovery and performance of two-stage system,"3.4 Energy recovery and performance of two-stage system Based on the amount of bagasse (dry weight) that was used in the two-stage anaerobic digestion process, a hydrogen yield of 105 mL H2/g bagasse was achieved from the CSTR and 225 mL CH4/g bagasse from the UASB reactor. Therefore, the total equivalent energy recovery was 9.2 kJ/g bagasse, which is 56% of the bagasse potential energy of 16.35 kJ/g bagasse. The total equivalent energy recovered in our experiment is higher than the 4.8 kJ/g bagasse reported by Baêta et al. (2016) and the 7.98 kJ/g bagasse reported by Kumari and Das (2015) and is similar to the value of 8.2 kJ/g bagasse previously reported by Arreola-Vargas et al. (2016). The advantages of the two-stage fermentation process are high-energy recovery and process stability (Nualsri et al., 2016a). The first advantage could be explained by both the hydrogen recovery in the acidogenesis phase and the enhancement of the methane production during methanogenesis, due to the optimized pre-fermentation in the first stage. Arreola-Vargas et al. (2016) reported that the overall energy recovery from agave bagasse (50%) in the two-stage process outperformed the single-stage process for methane production by 3.3 times. Schievano et al. (2014) obtained 42% more energy in a two-stage process compared to one-stage where the fruit/vegetable/swine manure mixture was directly subjected to methane production. Methane production by one-stage fermentation is a process inherently limited by the low substrate to biomass ratio that should be used to keep growing conditions. High OLR can result in the accumulation of high concentrations of VFAs, causing the drop in pH to inadequate values for the growth of methanogens (Nualsri et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2011b). Indeed, a two-stage process for hydrogen and methane production allows the use of high OLR in the methanogenic phase, as it has been demonstrated by other works and uphold by this study, removes the need for strict pH control, because in this case the VFAs consumption auto-regulates the pH between 7 and 8. An additional advantage of the two-stage process is increased COD removal efficiency compared to the one-step methane process (Reungsang et al., 2016). Table 4 presents a comparison of some studies that have used lignocellulosic biomass as substrate for the anaerobic digestion process in two stages, under a continuous operating regime. It can be noted that the total HRT (6 h for the first stage + 14 h for the second stage) employed in this work was shorter than those reported by these other authors. The shorter HRT, in combination with the higher OLR applied in both reactors, resulted in this superior two-stage system performance. In addition, in the case of a direct integration of the CSTR-UASB system, the results of this work led to the reduction of the ratio of the working volumes of both reactors, since the UASB reactor volume would have to be approximately twice the volume of the CSTR (ratio 1 L:2 L); this is a great improvement with respect to that employed by Nualsri et al. (2016a) where the CSTR and UASB volumes were adjusted to a ratio of 1 L:24 L. This advantage is substantially desirable for full-scale applications, mainly because a reduction of the HRT allows reducing the volume of the reactors and therefore their cost (Chandra et al., 2012)."
13,Conclusions,"Through the continuous two-stage process for hydrogen and methane production, 56% (9.2 kJ/g bagasse) of the energy contained in the agave bagasse was recovered. In the first stage, the increase of the stirring speed improved the hydrogen transfer from the liquid to the gas phase decreasing the H2 consumption by homoacetogenesis. In the second stage, high OLR and short HRT were an effective combination to increase the VMPR and obtain both methane yields and COD removal above 90%. This study provides suitable operational conditions for industrial application of continuous two-stage sequential process to maximize energy recovery from Agave bagasse hydrolysates."
