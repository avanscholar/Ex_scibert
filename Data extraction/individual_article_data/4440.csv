0,Introduction,"Owing to the rapid development of electronic products, the energy storage system with high energy-density is needed urgently [1–3]. In this regard, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with superior advantages, such as high theoretical energy density (2600 Wh/kg), low cost, and environmental friendliness, have received tremendous attention [4–7]. However, the further application of Li-S battery in practice has been hindered by the following problems: (1) the poor conductivity of sulfur, leading to the low sulfur utilization; (2) the severe diffusion of polysulfide intermediates, causing the obvious capacity loss after long cycles; (3) the low active material loading in the cathode, resulting in the inferior energy density in practical application [8–11]. Therefore, the fabrication of high loading sulfur cathode with good electrochemical performance is urgent and necessary for Li-S batteries. As an essential ingredient of sulfur electrode, polymer binder plays a crucial role to realize the ideal high-loading electrode. Nevertheless, limited by the relatively weak adhesion and poor restriction to polysulfides, traditional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder is not suitable for sulfur cathode, especially at high sulfur loading [12,13]. Aiming to address the negative impact of PVDF, various polymers with polar functional groups have been used as the sulfur cathode binders and exhibit promising potentiality owing to the strong adhesion and polysulfides adsorption [14]. For example, Bhattacharya et al. investigated the commercial polyamidoamine dendrimers as a functional binder and the sulfur cathode delivered 2.8 mA h/cm2 at 0.2 C [15]. Yan et al. reported the sulfur cathode with a cross-linked epoxy resin binder could exhibit 2.1 mA h/cm2 (0.5 C) at the sulfur loading of 1.9 mg/cm2 [16]. Chen et al. reported a hyperbranched binder with the crosslinking of poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether and polyethylenimine and a high discharge capacity of 763 mA h/g could be observed after 100 cycles (0.5 C) [12]. However, with sulfur loading increasing, thicker cathode is inescapable which make a great challenge to achieve successful lithium ion (Li+) transport in cathode [9]. As we know, the conductions of electron and Li+ are equally important during electrochemical process. To realize the superior electrochemical performance of high loading sulfur cathode, the Li+ conductivity should also be considered for the electrode binder [13,17,18]. Therefore, developing the multi-functional binder polymers with superior adhesion, polysulfides adsorption, and Li+ conductivity is extremely critical for advanced sulfur cathodes. According to the mentioned considerations, we design the lithium polyacrylate (LiPAA)/ polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) complex binder through hydrogen bonding crosslinking in this work. Benefiting from the good Li+ conductivity of LiPAA, strong mechanical strength of crosslinking network and anchoring lithium polysulfides with oxygen-containing groups, the LiPAA/PVA binder based sulfur cathode with superior electrochemical performance can show a higher discharge capacity of 654.2 mA h/g (0.5 C) comparing to the cathode with PVDF and LiPAA binder after 200 cycles. Moreover, the discharge capacity of this electrode also achieves nearly 800 mA h/g (0.25 C) at a high-loading of sulfur (4.0 mg/cm2). These results indicate the LiPAA/PVA binder has a great potential to fabricate the high-areal loading sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries."
1,Experimental section,
2,Fabrication of sulfur cathode with different binders,"2.1 Fabrication of sulfur cathode with different binders Sulfur/carbon composite was prepared via a dissolution-recrystallization strategy in our previous report [19]. The 0.2 g commercial activated carbon YP80 (Kuraray) and 0.6 g elemental sulfur (Aladdin) were dispersed into 30 mL ethyl alcohol with the aid of ultrasound until the visible sulfur particles disappearing. After complete evaporation of ethyl alcohol, the YP80/S composite with 75 wt% sulfur content was obtained and used as the active material. To fabricate the cathodes, PVDF, LiPAA, and LiPAA/PVA were used respectively as binders. The LiPAA was synthesized through the reaction between LiOH (Aladdin) and PAA (Mv∼450000, Aladdin) with an equimolar amount. The LiPAA/PVA binder was prepared by mixing LiPAA and PVA (1799, Aladdin) at the weight ratio of 2:1. To prepare LiPAA/PVA based sulfur cathodes, the active material YP80/S, conductive black carbon, and LiPAA/PVA were mixed uniformly with a mass ratio of 80:12:8 in water. Then, the derived slurry was coated on the aluminum (Al) foil and dried in vacuum overnight (60 °C). The sulfur cathodes with LiPAA and PVDF were fabricated with the same process. Noticeably, the N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and water were used to dissolve PVDF and LiPAA, respectively. All of the cathodes show the average sulfur loading of 1.2 mgsulfur/cm2."
3,Materials characterization,2.2 Materials characterization The detailed structures of sulfur cathodes with different binders were characterized by a Philips XL-30 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) was measured with Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700. The adhesion strength of binders to Al current collectors was investigated in the same way reported in previous literature [8]. Pairs of Al strips were washed with alcohol and acetone. The binder solution was coated on the clean Al strip with a coating area of 1 cm × 1 cm. Two Al strips were bonded together through overlapping the coating areas and dried at 60 °C. The adhesion strength was tested by a Hounsfield THE 10K-S with a stretching rate of 10 mm/min.
4,Electrochemical experiments,"2.3 Electrochemical experiments The sulfur cathodes with different binders were cut into 12 mm-diameter rounds to assemble Li-S coin cell. The polypropylene membrane (celgard 2400) and lithium metal foil were used as the separator and anode, respectively. The Li-S battery electrolyte was 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, 1:1, v/v) with 2 wt% LiNO3. The ratio of electrolyte to sulfur was controlled at 20 μL/mgsulfur. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was investigated by CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured using an Autolab PGSTAT100 N electrochemical workstation with an amplitude of 5 mV. The rate and cycle performance were conducted with a Land battery test system (CT2001A, Wuhan Land Electronic Co., China) between 1.7 and 2.8 V."
5,Result and discussion,"Owing to the crucial role of binder in sulfur cathode for Li-S battery, a multi-functional composite binder containing LiPAA and PVA with robust mechanical strength, substantial lithium polysulfides restriction, and rapid Li+ transfer was proposed in this work. As shown in Fig. 1 a, we design a robust 3D cross-linking polymer network through the hydrogen bonding between LiPAA and PVA macromolecular chains. Benefiting from the crosslinked structure, LiPAA/PVA binder would ensure the tight contact between sulfur composite and conductive addition during charge-discharge process and maintain sulfur cathode integrity even at high sulfur loading [13,20]. Furthermore, the abundant oxygen-containing polar groups of LiPAA/PVA complex binder could adsorb lithium polysulfides strongly and restrict its irreversible dissolution [21,22]. Also, LiPAA with the high theoretical Li+ capacity could act as an extra Li + reservoir to support Li+ transport in cathode at high current density [23–25]. Based on the above merits, the LiPAA/PVA complex binder shows a great potential to fabricate high-performance sulfur cathode. To confirm the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between LiPAA and PVA, FTIR was performed in Fig. 1b and c. Comparing with the OH stretching band of pure PVA (3423 cm−1), the corresponding peak of LiPAA/PVA shifts to 3401 cm−1, indicating the existence of hydrogen bonding between −OH in PVA and −COO- in LiPAA which could form the crosslinked three-dimensional LiPAA/PVA polymer network [13,26,27]. Benefiting from the above crosslinked polymer network and strong interaction between the carboxylate ions of LiPAA and the aluminum oxide (Al2O3) passivation layer on Al current collector surface [28,29], the binder of LiPAA/PVA composite exhibits higher adhesion forces of 3.48 N comparing with LiPAA (2.83 N) and PVDF (0.44 N) in Fig. 1d. To prove the strong cohesive force among sulfur composite, conductive additives, and Al collector with LiPAA/PVA binder, a visual peeling test was measured as follows. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the sulfur composite and conductive addition with PVDF binder can be detached from the collector easily. In contrast, the sulfur composite and conductive addition can attach on the Al collector tightly with the binder of LiPAA (Fig. 2b) and LiPAA/PVA (Fig. 2c) owing to the significant chemical interaction between the carboxylate ions of LiPAA and the Al2O3 passivation layer on Al collector surface [28]. Comparing with LiPAA based sulfur cathode, less sulfur composite and conductive addition can be detached in LiPAA/PVA based sulfur cathode indicating the LiPAA/PVA binder with crosslinked network could enhance the connection between sulfur composite and conductive addition [20,26]. Moreover, the micro-structures of sulfur cathodes with PVDF, LiPAA, and LiPAA/PVA binders are exhibited in Fig. 2d-f, respectively. The uniform and complete surface can be observed in the LiPAA/PVA based sulfur cathode ensuring the intimate connection between sulfur composite and conductive additive [30,31]. Attributing to the intimate connections among sulfur composite, conductive addition and Al collector, a continuous conductive network could be formed in the sulfur cathode with LiPAA/PVA binder, which could support the electron transport successfully during electrochemical process [13]. The similar result also could be achieved in Fig. S1. To testify the strong adhesion of LiPAA/PVA binder further, morphologies of sulfur cathode at folding state were shown in Fig. 3 . At the crease area, we can observe obvious Al collector leakage on the surface of PVDF based cathode at the folding area (Fig. 3a-b). As a comparison, the sulfur composite and conductive addition still adhere to Al collector surface with the action of LiPAA/PVA. This result is consistent with the above conclusion and visually demonstrates the strong mechanical properties of LiPAA/PVA which could maintain a stable conductive network. The CV curves of as-prepared sulfur cathodes were tested at 0.1 mV/s. In Fig. 4 a, there are two typical cathodic peaks at nearly 2.3 V and 2.0 V, indicating the formation of soluble long-chain polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 ≤ x ≤ 8) and insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. The overlap anodic peaks around 2.4 V means the transformation from Li2S2/Li2S to S8 [32–34]. As we know, the differences between anodic and cathodic peak potentials could evaluate the kinetic characteristics of the redox reactions during charge-discharge process [35]. Therefore, LiPAA/PVA based cathode exhibits faster reaction kinetic than LiPAA and PVDF based cathodes due to the smaller peak potential difference. Attributing to the faster reaction kinetic, the cathode with LiPAA/PVA binder shows the superior discharge capacity as follows. In Fig. 4b, the LiPAA/PVA based cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 947.1 mA h/g at 0.2 C, which is higher than the capacities of cathodes with LiPAA (703.0 mA h/g) and PVDF (678.9 mA h/g). Even at the high current of 2.0 C, the cathode with LiPAA/PVA binder also exhibit the highest capacity of 508.4 mA h/g contributing to the effective lithium polysulfides adsorption and successful conduction of electron /Li+. Moreover, the three-dimensional LiPAA/PVA crosslinked network could tolerate the volume change from S8 to Li2S2/Li2S and the oxygen-containing functional groups in LiPAA/PVA binder could bind lithium polysulfides within the cathode to restrain its migration [13,18,21]. Therefore, the cathode with LiPAA/PVA binder shows a higher discharge capacity than others after long cycles. It could deliver a discharge capacity of 654.2 mA h/g at 0.5 C after 200 cycles with no obvious capacity fading (in Fig. 4c), which is comparable with the previously literature (Table 1 ). Furthermore, the smooth cathode surface and light color of separator after cycling also prove the robust electrode structure and effective polysulfides restriction of LiPAA/PVA based cathode (in Fig. S4). Generally, the areal capacity of electrode determines the energy density of batteries. To realize the high-energy-density Li-S battery, the cathode with high sulfur areal loading is necessary. When the sulfur loading of LiPAA/PVA based cathode increase to 4.0 mg/cm2 (in Fig. 4d), the highest discharge capacity could achieve 758.4 mA h/g at 0.25 C, corresponding to an areal capacity of 3.03 mA h/cm2 which could match the requirement for high energy density of Li-S battery (2−3 mAh/cm2) [14,36]. Furthermore, the cathode also delivers a capacity retention of 85.3 % after 100 cycles. Combined with its low cost and environmental benignity (water-soluble), the LiPAA/PVA binder could be generalized for the large-scale application of lithium sulfur battery. To gain further explanation for the superb reaction kinetic of cathode with LiPAA/PVA binder, the EIS was measured at open-circuit voltage at frequency from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz. In Fig. 5 a, the diameter of the semicircle at high-frequency region can be attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Comparing to the cathodes with PVDF and LiPAA binders, the LiPAA/PVA based cathode maintains the lowest Rct indicating its fastest charge transfer in the interface between sulfur composite and conductive agents/liquid electrolyte during electrochemical process [43,44]. In low frequency region, the Warburg impedance of sloping line is related the diffusion of Li+ into electrode structure and the Li+ diffusion coefficient (DLi+) can be calculated as following [44,45]: (1) D L i + = R 2 T 2 2 A 2 n 4 F 4 C 2 σ 2 Where T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant, A is the geometric area of sulfur cathode surface, n is the number of electrons during the redox process, F is the Faraday constant, C is the molar concentration of Li+ and σ is the Warburg impedance constant. The value of σ could be obtained from the Eq. 2: (2) Z ' = R c t + R e + σ ω - 0.5 In Eq. 2, ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf, f is the frequency) and the corresponding relationships between Z’ and ω−0.5 are shown in Fig. 5b. Basing on the Eqs. 1 and 2, the DLi+ could be calculated and exhibited in the inset of Fig. 5b. Comparing with the PVDF binder based cathode, the sulfur cathodes with LiPAA and LiPAA/PVA deliver higher DLi+ indicating the faster Li+ diffusion in the electrode structure due to the good Li+ conductivity of LiPAA [24,25]. The fast charge transfer and Li+ diffusion could facilitate the reaction kinetic leading to a superior rate property, which is consistent with the above results of electrochemical measurements. These results confirm that by designing the crosslinked LiPAA/PVA complex binder with strong adhesion, polysulfides adsorption, and Li+ conductivity, the derived sulfur cathode could enhance the electrochemical properties significantly comparing to the commercialized PVDF binder. For glimpsing the potential application of sulfur cathode with LiPAA/PVA binder in practice, Li-S pouch cell was fabricated and tested in Fig. 6 . Comparing to the traditional PVDF based cathode, the pouch cell with LiPAA/PVA based cathode maintained a stable open circuit voltage after folded and refolded several times. This result manifests the sulfur cathode also exhibits a firm structure with the aid of LiPAA/PVA binder under external compressive load. Furthermore, the stable open circuit voltage of LiPAA/PVA based cathode demonstrates its low self-discharge after a long time (in Fig. S5). Hence, the LiPAA/PVA binder is a desirable substitute for conventional PVDF in the practical fabrication of sulfur cathode."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, we designed the cross-linked LiPAA/PVA blending to substitute PVDF as a multi-functional binder for sulfur cathode. Owing to the strong interaction among LiPAA, PVA, and Al collector, LiPAA/PVA binder has robust adhesion that could combine conductive carbon material to form the stable conductive network and endure the volume change of active material. Furthermore, the LiPAA also promote Li+ conductivity. Ascribing the successful conduction of electron and Li+, the LiPAA/PVA based cathode could exhibit 508.4 mA h/g at 2.0 C, remarkably higher than the sulfur cathode with PVDF (339.5 mA h/g). Additionally, the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and stable 3D crosslinked network of LiPAA/PVA can confine the migration of soluble polysulfides and relieve the volume change of active materials. Even after 200 cycles, the LiPAA/PVA derived cathode also deliver no obvious capacity fading. The remarkable electrochemical properties of LiPAA/PVA based cathode are comparable with the previously reported sulfur cathodes and the its fabrication could be achieved through a low-cost and environmentally friendly process. These results confirm the applicability of LiPAA/PVA binder for high energy density Li-S battery in large-scale production."
