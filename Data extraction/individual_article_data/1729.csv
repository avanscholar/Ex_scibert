0,Introduction,"Ultrasound is defined as a sound wave at a frequency above human hearing and has been widely applied to various research fields, such as welding, degassing of solutions, detection of defects, medical diagnosis and treatments [1]. During ultrasonication, an acoustic wave propagates in aqueous media, and then, microbubbles (cavitation bubbles) are generated in the rarefaction region. These cavitation bubbles get bigger in successive cycles, reach an unstable diameter, and then finally collapse [2]. As a result of cavitation ruptures, the hydro-mechanical shear stress localizes, the temperature increases up to 5000 K and highly reactive OH− radicals are generated [3]. Additionally, an increase in mixing and mass transfer, namely acoustic streaming, is also, reportedly, created in an aqueous solution or suspension [1]. To exploit these useful effects, ultrasound has also been applied to various biologically driven environmental fields, but its application is completely different regarding its intended purpose and main mechanism. The application of ultrasonication on biological processes can be classified as high-strength (HS) and low-strength (LS), based on where ultrasonication is irradiated [4]. HS-ultrasonication is referred to when ultrasonication is irradiated to a feedstock as a pretreatment, whereas LS-ultrasonication is irradiated to the reactor itself to target microorganisms involved in the biological process. Various mechanisms are suggested to explain the performance enhancement between LS- and HS-ultrasonication. While the former is attributed to an increase of substrate availability by solubilizing inert and slowly biodegradable sections, the enhanced performance by LS-ultrasonication is attributed to increased microbial activity through the stimulation of biological enzymes [5]. Given that LS-ultrasonication has economic advantages over HS-ultrasonication, LS-ultrasonication has been receiving increasing attention over the last decade [6]. Many research results have demonstrated the positive effects of LS-ultrasonication on aerobic, anaerobic and nutrient removal processes. Aerobic processes with LS-ultrasonication showed increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate (up to 6% with 10 min ultrasonication every 8 h at 0.3 W/cm2 of ultrasonic density), reduced sludge production (by 91.1% with 15 min ultrasonication at 120 kW/kg dried solids of ultrasonic intensity) and/or accelerated aerobic digestion (shortened from 17 days to 3–7 days at 0.53 W/cm2 of ultrasonic density) compared to the control [7,8]. Furthermore, enhanced nitrogen (up to 16% with 10 min ultrasonication every 5 h at 0.2 W/cm2 of ultrasonic density) and phosphorus (up to 50% with 10 min ultrasonication at 0.2 W/cm2 of ultrasonic density) removal rates were achieved from a biological nutrient removal process [9,10]. LS-ultrasonication has also been successfully applied to anaerobic procedures, such as the anaerobic digestion system [4] and the anaerobic hydrogen (H2) fermentation process [11]. To the best of our knowledge, only two research groups have reported the effects of LS-ultrasonication on anaerobic methane (CH4) [4,12] and/or H2 production [11]. In the former studies, which were the first reports of the application of LS-ultrasonication on CH4 production, 40% higher (2 s ultrasonication every 30 s at 0.0025 W/mL of ultrasonic intensity) and 43% higher (1 s ultrasonication every 1 min at 0.05 W/mL of ultrasonic intensity) CH4 yields were achieved from dry anaerobic and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASBR), respectively, than the control reactors [4,12]. The latter group [11] applied 1 s ultrasonication every 1 min at 0.25 W/mL of ultrasonic intensity to a continuous stirred tank reactor; H2 production rate was enhanced from 2.8 to 5.6 L/L/d while H2 yield increased from 1.0 to 1.9 mol H2/mol glucose. H2 is considered as one of the most promising alternative renewable energies due to many advantages, such as its clean nature (no CO2 emission during the combustion process) and high energy content of 122 kJ/g [13]. Biohydrogen-producing granules have been known to be advantageous, based on their ability to treat a high organic loading rate at high productivity [14]. However, no further study has been attempted on the biohydrogen process using a granular process, such as an upflow anaerobic stage reactor. Therefore, the present work investigated the effects of LS-ultrasonication on H2 production using UASBr, by dark fermentative process, for the first time. Furthermore, the influences of effluent recirculation with/without ultrasonication on H2 yield were also analyzed. The start-up performance was monitored, and the microbial community structure was thoroughly characterized in the presence/absence of ultrasonication, using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The energy balance of the LS-ultrasonication system was evaluated and future research directions were suggested."
1,Material and methods,
2,System setup and operation conditions,"2.1 System setup and operation conditions Seed sludge was taken from a pilot scale anaerobic digester treating foodwaste leachate located in D city, Korea. The pH, alkalinity, total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of sludge were 7.8, 3.1 g CaCO3/L, 33.9 g/L, 18.3 g/L and 12.4 g/L, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 , UASBr had the lower part of 810 mm height × 76 mm inside diameter (ID) and the upper part of 165 mm height × 110 mm ID with 3.8 L of effective volume. To investigate the both effects of ultrasonication and recirculation on dark fermentative H2 production (DFHP), two UASBr were installed with four vibrators (50 W, 20 kHz, customized device) while the effluent of two UASBr was recirculated with 2.5 m/h of upflow velocity from bottom to top. Thus, four reactors in total were used for this study: C (Control, without ultrasonication and recirculation), CR (Control with Recirculation, without ultrasonication but with recirculation), U (Ultrasonication, with ultrasonication but without recirculation), UR (Ultrasonication with Recirculation, with both ultrasonication and recirculation). After inoculation without any pretreatment, each reactor was purged with N2 gas for 10 min to provide anaerobic conditions. During continuous mesophilic (38 °C) operation, LS-ultrasonication was applied with following conditions: 200 W of ultrasonication strength, 0.1 W/L of ultrasonication strength (i.e., 2 L effective volume for ultrasonication), 1 s of ultrasonication time per every 1 min, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) was kept at 8 h corresponding of 45 g COD/L/day of organic loading rate (OLR). Glucose was used as a substrate at 15 g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L or 14.06 g glucose/L concentration. For the macro nutrients, NH4Cl, KH2PO4, and FeCl2·4H2O were added to yield a COD:N:P:Fe ratio of 100:5:1:0.33. The substrate solution also contained trace nutrients and 5 g of NaHCO3 to provide the buffer capacity as described previously [15]. The DFHP performance showed a steady state after day 5, and the reactors were operated continuously until day 25."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The concentrations of TS, VS, VSS and alkalinity were measured according to standard methods [16]. Glucose was measured by colorimetric method [17] and COD was measured using a commercial kit (Cat. #01013-01, Humas, Korea). The biogas was collected using gas-tight bags and sampled with a 1-mL gas-tight syringe to analyze H2 content. Measured biogas production was adjusted to standard temperature (0 °C) and pressure (760 mm Hg) (STP). The liquid samples were pretreated with a 0.20 μm membrane filter before injection to HPLC. Organic acids were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (LC-10A model, SHIMADZU Co.) with an ultraviolet (215 nm) detector (UV1000, SHIMADZU) and a 100 mm × 7.8 mm Fast Acid Analysis column (HPX-87H, Bio-Rad Lab.) using 0.005 M H2SO4 as a mobile phase. Flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, column was maintained at 35 °C. H2 gas content was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Gow Mac Series 580) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2 m × 2 mm stainless-steel column packed with a Porapak Q mesh (80/100) with nitrogen as carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50 °C, respectively."
4,Sampling and microbial analysis,"2.3 Sampling and microbial analysis To analyze the structure of microbial community, H2 producing granules was taken from each UASBr at day 25, when the reactors were terminated after steady state operation. The bottom port of each UASBr was open to release all the granules inside the reactor, and then 0.5 g of granule sample was taken for analysis. Total genomic DNA was extracted by using an automated nucleic acid extractor (Magtration System 12GC, PSS, Chiba, Japan). Before the extraction of genomic DNA, 200 μL of sample was centrifuged at 16,000g for 5 min, and the supernatant was decanted. Then the pellet was washed twice in three steps: (1) the pellet was added with deionized distilled water (DDW) to reach 200 μL and resuspended; (2) the suspension was centrifuged; (3) the supernatant was decanted. Finally, the pellet was gently resuspended and applied to the automated nucleic acid extractor (Magtration System 12GC). The DNA was eluted with 100 μL of Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. For each DNA sample, the hypervariable region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primer pairs used for amplification was F515 and R806 [18] with an additional degeneracy on the forward primer for improved detection of Archaea (base-N substituted for base-C in the third position of F515 forward primer) [19]. The PCR mixture (50 μL) was consisted of 5.0 μL of 10× Taq buffer (Solgent, Korea), 1.0 μL of dNTP (Solgent), 2.0 μL each of forward and reverse primers (final concentration 400 nM), 0.25 μL of Taq polymerase (Solgent), 5 μL of template DNA, and DDW to make 50 μL. The PCR reaction was conducted as following procedures: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 1 min. High-throughput sequencing of the amplicons was conducted using the Ion PGM™ System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Barcoded sequencing library was prepared using the Ion Plus fragment library kit (Life Technologies). For clonal amplification of the library, emulsion PCR was performed using the Ion PGM™ Hi-Q™ template kit (Life Technologies) and the OneTouch™ 2 instrument (Life Technologies). The template-positive ISPs (Ion Sphere Particles) enriched by the Ion OneTouch™ ES (Life Technologies) were loaded on the 316™ chip using the Ion PGM™ Hi-Q™ sequencing kit, and sequenced in the Ion PGM™ sequencer (Life Technologies) operated by the Torrent Suite™ software (version 5.0.4). Low-quality and short (<200 bp) reads were removed using Ion Reporter version 5.2. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were derived from high-quality reads with 97% sequence similarity threshold using UPARSE (v8.1.1861) [20]. Singletons were not considered while defining OTUs. The taxonomy of the OTUs were assigned using the Classifier (above the confidence threshold of 50%) from the Ribosomal Database Project [21]. Phylogenic tree was constructed with maximum likelihood method using MEGA 6 software [22] and annotated with a heatmap for log transformed relative abundance of OTUs using Evolview v2 [23]. Pearson’s chi-squared test and Duncan’s multiple range test were performed using software package R with libraries ‘reshape2’ and ‘agricolae’."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Process performance,"3.1 Process performance To investigate the effects of LS-ultrasonication on dark fermentative hydrogen production (DFHP), the performance of the start-up period (25 days) was monitored and is summarized in Table 1 . Without additional pH control, the pH was properly maintained in the acidic region, over the range pH 4.80–4.91 and complete glucose removal (over 99%, data not shown) was observed at all reactors. The highest H2 production rate (HPR) and H2 yield (HY) were achieved from U (4.68 L/L/d, 0.89 mol H2/mol hexose), followed by UR (3.77 L/L/d, 0.72 mol H2/mol hexose), CR (3.05 L/L/d, 0.58 mol H2/mol hexose) and C (2.83 L/L/d, 0.54 mol H2/mol hexose). These values were significantly different between the two groups with (U, UR) or without (C, CR) LS-ultrasonication (Table 1). The enhanced HY under LS-ultrasonication is consistent with previous results [11], which documented up to 65% higher HY with LS- compared to HS-ultrasonication. Previous studies have suggested different explanations for the enhanced performance of various biological processes using LS-ultrasonication. The proposed mechanisms can be categorized into five: (1) enhancement of mass transfer via increased permeability and/or specific surface area [5] and reduced thickness of the cell wall and/or membrane [24]; (2) decreased dissolved gas concentration (degassing effect) [11]; (3) increased microbial growth rate [25]; (4) activation of enzyme excretion due to acoustic streaming [26] or consequences of self-defense mechanism [27]; and (5) selective enrichment and/or structural shift of the microbial community [11,28]. Among these, the degassing effect seems to be one of the major reasons for our results (up to 65% increase of HY). The degassing impact, reportedly induced by cavitation bubbles, commonly coincides with the decrease of dissolved gas (e.g., CO2, H2) concentrations in the liquid [29]. In this study, the H2 concentrations in the liquid seemed to have decreased in the ultrasound-attached reactors and resulted in the increased H2 content in the headspace, by up to 20%, compared to the controls, as similarly evident in a previous study [11]. The dissolved H2 concentration has been considered as one of the most important factors affecting H2 fermentation because DFHP relies on re-oxidation of reduced ferredoxin and H2-carrying coenzymes [30]. However, these reactions are known to be less favorable under increasing H2 concentrations in the liquid, due to thermodynamic reasons [31]. Interestingly, the effects of recirculation on H2 production performance differed with or without ultrasonication (Table 1). Without ultrasonication, recirculation (CR) led to 7.4% enhanced HY than the control (C). This tendency could be attributed to an improved mass transfer inside the UASBR, where the mass transfer between the granules and substrate is often limited, due to the lack of mechanical mixing [32]. In contrast, under ultrasonication, recirculation adversely affected the HY (decreased by 19% for UR than U), and it could be explained by two reasons. First, the cumulative shear stress on H2-producing microorganisms caused by both recirculation and ultrasonication could be excessive and detrimental to the granular biomass, as similarly evident elsewhere [4]. Second, the expansion of the granular bed could have reduced the amount of H2-producing granules being irradiated because the ultrasonic vibrators were located at the lower part of the reactor (Fig. 1). The amount of granules above the vibrator zone could not be directly measured due to the invisibility of the granules inside the UASBr’s. Considering the upflow velocity of 2.5 m/h in CR and UR, which is lower than the typical upflow velocity (4–10 m/h) of an expanded granular sludge bed [33], the fraction of granules above the vibrator zone must have been limited in CR and UR. As summarized in Table 2 , the predominant volatile fatty acids (VFAs) detected in this study were lactic acid (HLc), butyric acid (HBu), acetic acid (HAc) and propionic acid (HPr). DFHP is accompanied by the production of VFAs and alcohols. HBu and HAc are often the main VFAs during an active DFHP, with the theoretical maximum yield of 2 and 4 mol H2/mole glucose, respectively [34]. Conversely, the formation of HLc and HPr are reported as unfavorable reactions, adversely affecting H2 production performance [35]. Therefore, the relative fractions of the VFAs in the fermentate are often considered as useful indicators to monitor the DFHP performance. For example, the HBu-to-HPr (B/P) ratio has been suggested as a positive indicator of H2 production [36,37]. Similarly, the B/P ratio in this study showed a perfect (ρ = 1.0) positive rank correlation with HY (Tables 1 and 2). Another example is the HBu-to-HAc (B/A) ratio. However, the relationship between the B/A ratio and the DFHP performance is controversial; while a positive correlation between the two parameters was reported in some studies [36,38], no clear relationship has been claimed in others [37,39]. In this study, the B/A ratio did not show a clear correlation with H2 production. In previous studies involving a continuous stirred tank reactor and anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, the B/A and B/P ratios correlated significantly with the DFHP performance, respectively [37,40]. Thus, the reactor configuration seems to be one of the governing factors for H2 fermentation because different reactor configurations can lead to variations in flow regime, mass transfer and microbial community development, which, in turn, may result in uneven employment of metabolic pathways [14]. The COD equivalents of the effluent and the produced H2 gas were compared with the influent COD, to calculate the COD recovery ratio (Table 2). The granular biomass was negligible in the effluent (data not shown). The COD recovery ratio reached 85.5–99.6%, with a higher recovery ratio achieved under ultrasonication conditions. The remaining COD fractions (0.4–14.5%) were assumed to be used for cell maintenance and synthesis; these fractions were very low for U (0.4%) and UR (6.7%). Similarly, an earlier study mentioned an up to 32% lower biomass yield under ultrasonication than the control in an H2 production system [11]. Another study estimated 0.1 g VSS/g glucose of biomass yield, corresponding to 13% of the CODinput, for H2 producers using a kinetic model [41]. The abnormally low biomass yield under LS-ultrasonication, in this study, could be partly explained by the concept of endogenous respiration and death-regeneration (decay-cryptic growth) proposed in an activated sludge process [42], but further experiments are necessary to clarify this point."
7,Microbial community analysis,"3.2 Microbial community analysis A total of 84,128 high-quality sequence reads were obtained and were assigned to a total of 241 OTUs belonging to the seed inoculum (194), C (47), CR (46), U (42) and UR (49) (Table 3 ). A significant reduction of the apparent richness and Shannon index was observed in the reactor samples (C, CR, U and UR) compared to the seed inoculum. The decreased diversity is the result of selective enrichment of fermenters and H2 producers from mixed functioning microbes in the anaerobic seed sludge, which had been treating food waste leachate, a high-strength organic wastewater consisting of different organics [43]. In contrast to the decreased diversity, increased evenness was observed at all reactors after successive acclimation. Except for UR, the diversity and evenness indices of the other three reactors were comparable. This trend was consistent with our previous research [28] for CH4 production using LS-ultrasonication but was inconsistent with another study [11] for H2 production using LS-ultrasonication. The lowest diversity and evenness indices in the UR suggest that excessive stress might have adversely affected the balance of the microbial community. A significant shift of the microbial community was observed in the bioreactors (chi-squared for the genus level, p < 10−15) (Fig. 2 ). In the seed sludge, Thermotogae (36.6% of the total reads) was the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes (25.0%), Firmicutes (23.1%) and Proteobacteria (6.0%) (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the majority (>99.0%) of the sequences in the acclimated reactors were classified into one of the four phyla, Firmicutes (C: 67.9%, CR: 47.9%, U: 50.4%, UR: 38.4%), Proteobacteria (C: 21.6%, CR: 26.0%, U: 41.3%, UR: 53.2%), Bacteroidetes (C: 9.6%, CR: 16.8%, U: 6.8%, UR: 1.3%), or Actinobacteria (C: 0.9%, CR: 9.3%, U: 1.4%, UR: 7.1%). This change was further identified as the replacement of Defluviitoga (36.7%), Thiopseudomonas (5.9%) and others in the seed inoculum, by Clostridium (24.8–39.8%), Enterobacter (17.6–34.2%), Prevotella (1.3–16.8%), Aeromonas (2.7–16.0%), Sporolactobacillus (1.0–18.3%), Lactobacillus (2.5–9.0%) and Ethanoligenes (0.4–7.3%) genera in the H2-producing bioreactors (Fig. 2b). In the seed sludge, 45.6% sequences were unclassified at the genus level; however, 97.8–99.2% sequences were identified at the genus level for the reactor samples. These results are consistent with previous studies, whereby the methanogenic anaerobic digesters treating food waste leachate showed highly diverse microbial communities with largely uncharacterized members, whereas the H2-producing bioreactors had relatively well-characterized microbial communities [44,45]. Clostridium spp. are often recognized as the most predominant H2 producers under various operating conditions [46]. Likewise, this genus was one of the most abundant microbial genera in the H2-producing bioreactors in this study (Fig. 2b). Although Clostridium spp. were collectively the most (C, CR, and U) or the second most (UR) abundant genera, the relative abundance of the individual OTUs identified as its members diverged among the samples (Fig. 3 ; Table 4 ). For example, OTU 2, which is most closely related (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 100%) to Clostridium butyricum, was the top abundant OTU in C (24.5%) and CR (22.7%) but occupied 15.1% at UR and only 3.0% at U (Table 4). Similarly, other OTUs affiliated as Clostridium spp. were also under-represented in the ultrasonicated bioreactors (U and UR) than in the controls (C and CR): OTU 10 (C. tyrobutyricum), OTU 14 (C. akagii), and OTU 23 (Clostridium sp. strain S6). In contrast, some Clostridium-related OTUs such as OTU 11 (C. pasteurianum), OTU 19 (C. acidisoli), and OTU 15 (C. pasteurianum) were over-represented in sample U. These results suggest that there might have been competitions among Clostridium spp. and the use of ultrasonication and/or recirculation would have affected the outcome. Interestingly, C. pasteurianum has been claimed as the key H2 producer in H2-producing granules in a recent study [47]. In another study [48], C. pasteurianum was the dominant species responsible for high H2 production efficiency, while C. butyricum and C. tyrobutyricum were considered as competitors for the substrate (sucrose). These results imply that the preferred enrichment of C. pasteurianum (23.3%) over C. butyricum and C. tyrobutyricum (3.8%) in bioreactor U (Table 4) would have been partly responsible for the highest H2 yield from this bioreactor (Table 1). Enterobacter was also one of the dominant genera found in the bioreactors (Fig. 2b). OTU 6, with 99% sequence identity to E. cloacae, was the dominant Enterobacter in this study (Fig. 3; Table 4). E. cloacae has been documented as an efficient H2 producer, utilizing various substrates including glucose, suggesting its role in H2 production in this study [49]. The relative abundance of OTU 6 was higher in the ultrasonicated samples (U and UR; 27.3–34.2%) than in the controls (C and CR; 17.6–22.0%), indicating that this organism could have favored the LS-ultrasonication environment. Unlike OTUs 11 and 15 (C. pasteurianum), however, the relative abundance of OTU 6 peaked at sample UR with both LS-ultrasonication and recirculation (Table 4), possibly due to its resistance against shear stress [50,51]. A similar trend was observed for OTU 12, which was closely (99%) related to Aeromonas hydrophila (Fig. 3; Table 4). This OTU occupied 12.6–16.0% of the population in ultrasonicated bioreactors but only 2.7–2.8% in the controls (Table 4). A. hydrophila has been found to be particularly prevalent during the rapid acidogenic fermentation of glucose to acids and ethanol with H2 production, in a completely mixed anaerobic tank reactor [52]. Therefore, it could be inferred that this bacterium might have contributed to glucose fermentation under LS-ultrasonication conditions with shear stress. Bifidobacterium (0.9–9.3%), Prevotella (1.3–16.8%), Sporolactobacillus (1.0–18.3%), Lactobacillus (2.5–9.0%) and Ethanoligenes (2.7–16.0%) were also identified in the bioreactors (Fig. 2b). These genera were previously recognized as members of engineered H2-producing systems [46]. Although their roles in H2 production have not yet been fully understood, some evidence was provided for their positive (Bifidobacterium, Ethanoligenes), negative (Prevotella, Lactobacillus) and controversial (Sporolactobacillus) interactions with H2 production [46]. The relative abundance of these bacteria in the four bioreactors (Fig. 2b) did not simply follow the H2 yield pattern (Table 1), implying that their roles and interactions in this study were complex. Interestingly, Bifidobacterium was over-represented in the recirculation bioreactors (CR and UR; Fig. 2b). This finding might be because the B. dentium-like organism (OTU 20; Fig. 3; Table 4) favored the higher upflow velocity conditions caused by recirculation and contributed to lactate fermentation [21]; however, the precise effects of this bacterium could be determined in a future study. In this study, significant shifts of the microbial communities were noticed between the seed inoculum and the four bioreactors, supporting the successful enrichment of H2 producers (Fig. 2). Overall, the four bioreactors showed similar microbial community structures, with Clostridium and Enterobacter as the major genera (Fig. 2b); these two genera are often recognized as the critical players in anaerobic mixed-culture fermentative H2 production [46]. In detail, multiple Clostridium spp. were identified in this study (Fig. 3; Table 4), inferring a potential relationship with the overall H2 yield (Table 1). Also, the enrichment of different bacteria other than Clostridium and Enterobacter was also identified (Fig. 2). Given that a successful biohydrogen production is dependent on the overall performance of the mixed community production [46], the roles of these bacteria could be considered significant in this study. The results of microbial community analysis using NGS indicated that LS-ultrasonication seems to have affected both the microbial community structures and the physiological states of the anaerobic consortia [26]."
8,Energy balance and future perspectives,"3.3 Energy balance and future perspectives In this study, four ultrasound vibrators (50 W each) were used to enhance the DFHP performance in the UASBr. The energy required to run ultrasound vibrators was estimated as 200 W × (1 s/min operation) × 24 h/d × 3.6 kJ/Wh = 288 kJ/d. The extra H2 gas produced for U compared to C was (4.68 − 2.83) L/L/d [HPR; Table 1] × 3.8 L [effective volume] = 7.03 L/d. Assuming the energy value of 13 kJ/L for H2 gas at STP, the extra energy value gained using LS-ultrasonication from the UASBr was 7.03 L/d × 13 kJ/L = 91.4 kJ/d. This value is only 32% to the energy used to run LS-ultrasonication, indicating a negative net energy balance. Thus, the LS-ultrasonication system used in this study was not energy positive in the current format. Nevertheless, this study provided a successful proof-of-concept to estimate the applicability of LS-ultrasonication on DFHP process, fulfilling the objective of this study. It should be noted that DFHP can be used to treat different organic wastes and to produce bioenergy [53,54], suggesting that higher treatment efficiency potentially induced by applying LS-ultrasonication may be valuable itself. In addition, given that H2 content is directly related to the cost of biogas purification (mostly CO2 removal) for commercial plants [51], enhanced H2 content using LS-ultrasonication (Table 1) can be an economic merit of this system. To improve the energy balance of LS-ultrasonication, future studies can be designed to test (1) shorter ultrasound application time, (2) longer ultrasound application interval, and (3) lower ultrasound intensity. Finally, another approach could be tested that LS-ultrasonication is temporarily installed and operated during the start-up period to promote initial microbial community shift, and then the microbial community is maintained while the reactor is operated without ultrasound. To summarize, various research directions could be suggested to supplement the results of this study."
9,Conclusions,"The effects of LS-ultrasonication on both start-up performance and microbial structure of biohydrogen production process were investigated for the first time in the biological granules system (the UASBr). Up to 65% increased HY demonstrated the positive effects of LS-ultrasonication, and it appears to be related to a decrease in the dissolved H2 concentration via a degassing effect. Furthermore, the presence/absence of LS-ultrasonication/recirculation seems to significantly affect the competitions of H2 producers, resulting in dramatic community shifts. Among various H2 producers, Ethanoligenes cloacae and Aeromonas hydrophila were identified as key bacteria under the LS-ultrasonic condition."
