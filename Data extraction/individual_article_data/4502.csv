0,Introduction,"The role in improving the performance of the chemical industry in the health, safety and environmental sectors is global, through responsible behavior that goes beyond the level of compliance. Research teams of many world companies have recently been working on the development of polymeric materials based on renewable raw materials from nature. Environmental considerations such as biosphere and atmosphere pollution, greenhouse effect and ozone holes can be taken as the main reasons for the research, as well as the limitation of the basic resource for obtaining the highest number of polymeric materials, ie oil. In addition, the emission of chemicals can endanger the health and become an environmental problem, and research is directed toward the development of new types of materials, fuel, and alternative raw materials. Urea-formaldehyde resins (UF) are produced by polycondensation of urea-(NH2)2CO and formaldehyde-HCOH. They are used for electrical insulation, which does not require high working temperature, for impregnation of wood (with a small percentage of formaldehyde), for the manufacture of varnishes, resins, etc. The general characteristics of the UF resin are low cost, the possibility of making complex parts in only one operation, full dyeing through the mass, excellent properties of electrical and thermal insulation, a wide range of toughness, elasticity, and resistance to chemicals and solvents [1]. UF resin is a thermosetting adhesive system in the production of wood-based wood panels, such as chipboards designed for furniture, interior elements, and interior construction elements. The popularity of this type of adhesive is reflected in the fact that around 95% of the total consumption of UF adhesives is used in this branch of industry, in the countries of the European Union with Norway, which amounts to more than 5 mils. tons a year ie. 11 mil. tons throughout the world [2–5]. Therefore, the use of UF adhesives ensures the production of products of required performance at a competitive market price. On the other hand, its deficiency is reflected in the hydrolytic degradation of amino-methylene bonds, which makes it low moisture resistance, and also affects a significant level of degradation in conditions of elevated temperature and humidity; therefore, limiting its application to the production of exclusively interior products. The second defect of UF adhesives refers to the release of HCOH, which can lead to certain restrictions on the use of plates even in interior conditions, bearing in mind strict regulations on the maximum allowed concentration of HCOH in the air. However, over the past three decades, and as a result of intensive research, development, and application of new types of UF adhesives, this problem has been significantly reduced [6]. In order to improve the already known characteristics of the UF resin, experiments were performed to obtain newly modified resins. By adding different components, the goal was to obtain resins that would have better properties, while meeting the requirements for preserving the natural environment. The substances that are added in order to obtain a higher quality resin can be inorganic substances (silicon (IV) oxide, titanium (IV) oxide, montmorillonite), organic compounds (various coumarins, thiosemicarbazide, melamine, hexamethyltetramine) and compounds of biological origin (wood flour, starch, cellulose, etc.), Each of these substances improve certain properties of the resin [7–10]. Due to the release of HCOH from glued wood products, and it is known that UF resins, among others, are used for impregnating wood or wooden panels used in the interior of residential and other facilities, it is desirable that the percentage of free HCOH in the resin is small, as it is known that HCOH has a detrimental effect on humans or the entire living world. Formaldehyde vapor strongly irritates the respiratory tract. Concentrations of 10–20 ppm make breathing difficult and concentrations of 650 ppm can cause death in just a few minutes. Often, inhalation of low concentrations can cause chronic respiratory diseases. Symptoms and limits are individual and occur within wide exposure limits. Some people may experience symptoms such as eye and throat irritation, tiredness, headache, and nausea, due to exposure to low formaldehyde concentrations (0.1–1 ppm) [11]. In addition to the free formaldehyde in the resin itself, which is spontaneously emitted, due to its low moisture resistance, hydrolysis of the UF resin can occur, which involves the breakage of the bonds in the resin (methylene ether bridges) and the additional emission of formaldehyde into the environment Formaldehyde also has a carcinogenic effect. Having all this in mind, the HCOH concentration limits in polymeric materials are set, and intense efforts are made to create modified forms of composite materials with a potentially reduced formaldehyde emission [6]. Many materials such as SiO2, TiO2, carbon nanotubes and dendrimer are designed to degrade or absorb contaminants from water, soil and polymer materials such as UF resin. The application of these materials is determined by the properties of nanomaterials such as surface properties, crystalline structure, and morphology [12]. Reduction of HCOH emissions from UF resin products can be achieved in several ways, one of which is to reduce the ratio of formaldehyde to urea in synthesis, and the other is that during the synthesis, compounds known as free HCOH scavengers in the resin, such as titanium (IV) oxide, silicon (IV) oxide, and wood flour, are added to the reaction mixture. Titanium dioxide is used as a filler to improve mechanical properties and absorption of free HCOH in the resin itself. In recent years, due to the over-dependence of global needs from fossil resources to supply energy and other miscellaneous product, sustainable production has become a problem because its development depends on the change from petrochemical sources to renewable materials [13]. Furfural is a bio-based furan aldehyde obtained through acid hydrolysis followed by acid dehydration of polymeric pentoses from renewable sources like agricultural/industrial wastes (corn cob, rice husk and oat meal) [14]. Furfuryl alcohol is manufactured industrially by hydrogenation of furfural, which is itself typically produced from waste biomass such as corncobs or sugar cane bagasse. As such furfuryl alcohol may be considered a green chemical [15]. Furfuryl alcohol is the most important chemical derived from furfural, having a broad spectrum of application in the chemical industry. Of the total production of furfural aldehyde, 65% is used to produce furfuryl alcohol. High-energy radiation is a well-known technique for modification of polymers. At the same time, two processes are carried out during the radiation of the polymer: crosslinking and chain scission. The balance of these reactions in polyolefin chains, exposed to high energy processes that produce free radicals, can result in obtaining improved properties and new applications of modified polymers. Radiation resistance is the ability of the polymers to maintain the initial physical and chemical properties, macro- and microstructure, in spite of radiation, that is, that there is no networking or degradation of the polymer. It depends on temperature, pressure, various defects in the polymeric material. This ability is of great importance for polymers that are applied in nuclear plants. Polymers with conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings due to the resonant effect have higher radiative resistance. Full protection against ionizing radiation is not possible [16]. However, little work concerning the effects of γ-irradiation on the thermal properties of modified UF resins has been done. The goal of this work was to determine the radiation stability of the synthesized TiO2-based urea–formaldehyde (UF) composite materials based on their thermal behavior. The thermal behavior of two types of TiO2-based UF resin (unirradiated and irradiated) was investigated using non-isothermal TGA, DTG and DTA supported FTIR spectra."
1,Experimental,"The materials that were used in the study are stated here: Urea (Alkaloid-Skopje, FYR of Macedonia); 35% formaldehyde (Unis-Goražde, Bosnia, and Herzegovina); furfuryl alcohol and nano-TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The average diameter, density and specific surface of the nano-TiO2 were 25 nm, 3.9 g cm−3 and 45–55 m2g−1, respectively. All other reagents and solutions used in analytical methods were of analytical purity."
2,Synthesis modified UF composites,2.1 Synthesis modified UF composites Two samples of modified UF composite materials with formaldehyde to urea (F/U) ratio (0.8) with TiO2 and FA were synthesized using the same procedure [17].
3,Determination of free formaldehyde,"2.2 Determination of free formaldehyde The percentage of free HCOH was determined by the sulfite method [18,19]. The percentage of free formaldehyde content was calculated from the equation given in our previous work [19]."
4,FTIR spectroscopy analysis,"2.3 FTIR spectroscopy analysis The FTIR spectroscopy in transmittance mode was used for the characterization of the functional group of the resin. FTIR spectra of samples were recorded at room temperature in the wave number range of 4000–500 cm−1 on a Nicolet spectrophotometer (Model 380, Thermo Nicolet Corporation, Madison, USA), with 64 scans for each spectrum and spectral resolution of 4 cm−1."
5,γ-Irradiation,"2.4 γ-Irradiation Irradiations of prepared samples were performed in air in the Co-60 radiation sterilization unit at the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences. The Radiation Unit of the Vinca Institute has been described in more detail elsewhere [20], the facility core is Co-60 gamma irradiator with wet storage working in batch mode (CEA, France). The samples were irradiated by gamma rays at room temperature with the dose rate of 10 kGyh−1 and total absorbed dose of 50 kGy."
6,Thermal analysis,"2.5 Thermal analysis The thermal stability was investigated by nonisothermal thermogravimetry (TG, DTA) using a Setaram Setsys Evolution 1750 instrument (France). The samples were heated from 30 to 600оC in a 20 cm3/min flow of argon atmosphere with a heating rate of 10оC/min. The temperatures at maximum decomposition rate were determined from the peak maxima of the DTG curves."
7,Results and discussion,"The conditions of the synthesis affect the types of bonds that occur during urea and its derivatives reactions: lower temperatures and slightly acidic solutions favor the formation of ether bonds (CH2 OCH2 ), while higher temperatures and lower pH values lead to the formation of a substantially more stable methylene links (CH2 ). Formation of methylene bonds is also achieved by decomposition of ethane bonds with the separation of HCOH. This phenomenon is of paramount importance in view of the increasingly stringent regulations regarding HCOH emissions. All of these reactions occur with the separation of water as a by-product of condensation. The polymer is formed during acid condensation [21]. Since UF products are commonly used for internal application, under moisture influence, in a warm environment, hydrolytic degradation occurs. Hydrolysis is followed by the release of formaldehyde, which is a potential health risk. Formaldehyde is produced by the breakdown of ether bonds and terminal methylol groups. The amount of free HCOH in the resin proportionally contributes to the amount of emitted formaldehyde from the chipboard and after pressing the plates at high temperatures [22]. Fig. 1 shows the content of free formaldehyde in modified UF resins, depending on the radiation dose. Prior to radiation, the sample modified by TiO2 has the largest percentage of free formaldehyde (0.15%). This high level of formaldehyde in UF/TiO2 is probably due to the agglomeration of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The agglomeration between nano-particles can have a significant impact both on the reactivity of nanomaterials and on their effectiveness in capturing contaminants, such as HCOH in UF resin. In the case of UF/TiO2/FA resin, the percentage of free HCOH is 0.1%, possibly due to the presence of FA, which additionally lowers HCOH content. During the exposure of the resin to radiation, constant generation of free radicals trapped in the crystalline region of the macromolecules is slowly migrated to the crystalline or amorphous contact surface, where they react with oxygen and create the available peroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals and initiate degradation, near the contact surface. When enough of these radicals are created, there is a breakdown of the chains whose length decreases dramatically. In this way, the degradation of the macromolecules occurs due to the effect of radiation, which leads to the release of formaldehyde, which is then consumed in the subsequent crosslinking of the resins in the irradiated samples. As a consequence, there is a decrease in the free HCOH value in the irradiated samples compared (0.04 and 0.03%) to the non-irradiated samples."
8,FTIR spectroscopy,"3.1 FTIR spectroscopy FTIR spectra and characteristic bands of investigated samples are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 . The spectra of both modified UF resins are almost identical. The shape of the bands in the FTIR spectra of the modified UF resin depends on the pH value. When the pH value of the reaction is small then the absorption bands of the modified UF resins become sharper and move towards the lower wave number values. Characteristic bands modified UF resins before and after radiation and their assignment are given in Table 1. The spectra of both modified UF resin (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) show medium-intensity absorption band in the region of about 3342–3348 cm−1 that is derived from NH valence vibrations in secondary amines but can also be attributed to hydrogen-bonded OH and NH groups. The sharpness of these bands was indicated a reduction in the extent of hydrogen-bonded interaction which is expected as the structure becomes more cross-linked due to methylenization reaction [23]. This band is sharp and typical of NH and OH hydrogen-bonded groups and if the band is fairly wide, it can be attributed to monomers such as water and formaldehyde, whose OH group can form hydrogen bonds with reactive functional groups such as CH2OH, NH2, and NH. Another medium-intensity absorption band is located in the region of 2963–2960 cm−1 in both modified UF resins and is attributed to the symmetric CH vibration of the CH2 group in CH2 OCH2 , CH2OH and NCH2 groups, before and after γ−irradiation, respectively. The intensity of the peak at 1635 cm−1 belongs to CC– bond that was relatively higher in modified UF resin with TiO2 compared to a resin which, in addition to TiO2, also contains FA (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) before irradiation. Strong absorption band which is about 1556 cm−1 derived from the deformation vibration of the NH in the 2° amine (amide II). The bonding of two methylol groups lead to the formation of ether bond (CH2 OCH2 ) so that the NH group may be bound to both sides. A weak absorption band at 1456 cm−1 is observed due to the CH2 bending mode of the CH2 N group. This assignment is in agreement with the reported results in the literature [24]. A weak band at 1386 cm−1 in both modified UF resins is attributed to the deformation vibrations of the CH group in CH2/CH2OH/NCH2 N. The peak at 1386 cm−1 was assigned to CH2OH, and this illustrates the typical reaction between urea and formaldehyde. The other observed peaks of 1138 and 1132 cm−1 and 1040 and 1036 cm−1 for both modified UF resin, were assigned to CO aliphatic ether and methylene bridge (NCH2N–), respectively [25–27]. The medium intensity band in the region of about 1150–1130 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric vibrations of the NCH2 N group, then the symmetric vibrations of the (COC) ethers. These peaks (NCH2 N and COC) show the cross-linking in the resin via N atoms [28,29]. It was concluded that the band at 1100–1200 cm−1 in modified UF polymers was assigned to the amide linkage [30]. The most intense bands are those typical of vibrations of the TiOTi bond at 620 and 560 cm−1, and 617 and 556 cm−1 for unirradiated and 620 and 559 cm−1 and 621 and 528 cm−1 for irradiated modified UF resin, respectively. It is consistent with the results of the Murashkevich and coauthors and Hamadanian and coauthors [31,32]. The absence of band at 883 cm−1 derived from the active hydrogen in the furan ring and band on the 599 cm−1, which derives from the deformation vibration of the furan ring means that there is a dehydration polycondensation and opening of the furan ring, which is then, as such, included in the polymerization reaction during the crosslinking process [33]. After radiation, the intensities of all the peaks decreased for modified UF resin containing FA, whereas for a sample containing only TiO2 they increase (Fig. 2(c) and (d)) but the values for most bands are almost identical before and after irradiation. Fig. 2(b) and (d) show that the intensity of the carboxyl group at 1627 cm−1 decrease with increasing the irradiation dose in both modified UF resin. The aliphatic stretch band about 2960 cm−1 and CO band at 1100 cm−1 decrease as the irradiation dose increases due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface, also [17]."
9,Thermal analysis,"3.2 Thermal analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is the most commonly used method for estimating the thermal stability of the polymer, which implies the continuous measurement of the change in the sample mass in function of time or temperature [34]. The thermal stability of a material is defined as the specific temperature or temperature–time limit in which the material can be used without excessive mass loss [35]. Thermal stability of synthesized UF resins was investigated by non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). In Fig. 3 there are TG, DTG and DTA curves of synthesized UF resins. Mass loss percentages, as well as DTG and DTA peaks, are found in Table 2 . From Fig. 3(b) it can be seen that the thermal behavior of unirradiated and irradiated UF resins samples occurs in three and four main stages. In each of these stages, there is a chemical reaction within the polymer, which leads to the partial evaporation of easily volatile substances by building a more stable structure. Up to 200 °C, the water leaves the polymer and all CH2 OCH2 bonds are converted into methylene bonds. The mass loss up to 100 °C generally refers to the removal of residual water and the evaporation of unreacted formaldehyde in the polymer. From Fig. 3(b) it can be seen that the second and third as well as third and fourth degradation regions overlap for the UF/TiO2 and UF/TiO2/FA resins, respectively. This means that the two degradation processes occurred simultaneously with a total weight loss of 22.8% and 32.9% for UF/TiO2 and UF/TiO2/FA resin, respectively, and indicate degradation of the polymer in both samples. At this stage, there are two peaks of the DTG curve (Fig. 3(b)): the maximum mass loss was 232.5 and 237.3 °C, while the temperature at the secondary tip 263.4 and 311.9 °C for the modified UF/TiO2 and UF/TiO2/FA resin, respectively. Jiang et al. reported that the major compounds emitted at this temperature were identified as carbon dioxide (CO2), isocyanic acid (HNCO), ammonia (NH3), hydrocyanic acid (HCN) and carbon monoxide (CO) [36]. Based on Fig. 3(c) and Table 2, it can be seen that the endothermic peak at 81.8, 85.2 °C for both modified UF resin before irradiation and 75.1 °C for irradiation UF/TiO2/FA resin, as well as the peak at 162.8 °C in irradiation UF/TiO2, derives from the loss of initial water as well as loss of water during condensation reaction, respectively. Endothermic peak with a minimum of 245.4 and 250.8 °C, in both modified UF resin, many authors attributed to the degradation of methylene ether bonds and the formation of methylene bonds, resulting in branching of chains and crosslinking reactions in the polymer. Each of these processes was followed by an appropriate loss of mass of the polymer, which can be seen from Table 2. The degradation of the crosslinked resin begins with the separation of formaldehyde from dimethylene ether groups [37]. This type of degradation can be considered as a subsequent crosslinking of the resin, and the separated formaldehyde is involved in further reactions giving more stable methylene groups. Endothermic peak with a minimum of 276.3, 273.0 and 256.9 °C for unirradiated and γ−irradiated modified UF resins, is due to the decomposition of stable units in the UF resin, i.e. methylenediurea. Table 2 shows the temperature values for the selected weight loss, such as T10, T30, and T50%. UF/TiO2/FA resin showed higher thermal stability at high temperature (213.8, 252.7 and 275.6 °C) than UF/TiO2 resin (191.4, 242.6 and 266 °C). DTG peaks for both modified UF resins are almost identical. Based on the T10% value, it can be said that the more thermally stable modified UF resin sample is the one modified with FA. In other words, degradation of the UF/TiO2/FA resin begins later. After radiation, the temperature values for the selected weight losses for UF/TiO2/FA are almost identical. Based on this, it can be concluded that UF/TiO2/FA is more thermally and radiation stable than UF/TiO2. Less mass loss shows UF/TiO2/FA both for the non-irradiated and the γ−irradiated (51.0 and 52.7%) compared to UF/TiO2 resin (51.7 and 55.1%)."
10,Conclusion,1. The free HCOH percentage for TiO2-based UF resin modified with FA is less than for UF/TiO2 resin. The free HCOH percentage is significantly reduced after γ-irradiation in both modified UF resin. 2. The total mass loss for TiO2-based UF resin modified with FA is less than that of the UF/TiO2 resin. 3. The shift of temperature values for selected mass losses (T10%) to higher temperature indicates the increase in thermal stability of samples based on modified UF/TiO2 resin with FA. 4. The radiation stability of UF/TiO2 resin with FA is greater than that of the UF/TiO2 resin.
