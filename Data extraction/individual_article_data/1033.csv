0,Introduction,"Currently, issues of global resource scarcity and environmental pollution are becoming increasingly serious worldwide. As a promising energy carrier, hydrogen is attracting ever-increasing attention due to its clean nature, economy, and high calorific value. Therefore, it may be extensively used to ameliorate the global energy crisis in the future [1,2]. Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda, who demonstrated the splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 over Pt and TiO2 electrodes under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation in 1972, photocatalytic hydrogen production has been extensively studied by researchers [3]. To this end, single-component semiconductor photocatalysts have commonly been applied [4,5]. However, such catalysts still have their limitations, such as only responding to the UV portion of solar light and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. Thus, the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductor photocatalysts is still unsatisfactory for practical applications. In this regard, it is of great significance and urgency to develop a broad-spectrum photocatalyst with high charge-separation efficiency to achieve large-scale photocatalytic hydrogen production. It has been widely demonstrated that Z-scheme photocatalytic systems are advantageous for practical applications [6–8]. In general, a Z-scheme photocatalytic system consists of two semiconductors with appropriate band gaps, denoted as photo-systems I and II (PS I and II). Photo-induced electrons in the conduction band (CB) of PS I easily transfer to the valence band (VB) of PS II due to their similar potentials, combining with holes. Photo-induced electrons with strong reducing ability in the CB of PS I and holes with strong oxidizing ability in the VB of PS II are preserved. Such a Z-scheme photocatalytic system has both strong oxidation potential and strong reduction potential. The light response range can be significantly broadened by adjusting the respective band gaps of the two semiconductor photocatalysts. In addition, due to the “Z” scheme of electron transmission, the recombination of electron–hole pairs of the individual semiconductor photocatalysts can be effectively inhibited. Among the various available photocatalysts, the wide-band-gap ZnTiO3 (ECB = −0.10 eV, EVB = +2.94 eV, ΔEbg = +3.04 eV) has relatively positive VB potential, and so can be used for photocatalytic degradation [9,10]. Narrow-band-gap CdS (ECB = −0.46 eV, EVB = +1.88 eV, ΔEbg = +2.34 eV) is commonly used in photocatalytic hydrogen production, because its conduction potential is more negative than the standard H+/H2 potential [11]. By combining ZnTiO3 with CdS, an ideal Z-scheme ZnTiO3/CdS photocatalytic system may be realized. At the same time, in order to obtain more efficient photocatalytic activity, it is necessary to introduce a conductive channel to accelerate electron transfer in Z-scheme photocatalytic systems. In recent years, the influence of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on photocatalysis has attracted the attention of many researchers [12–15]. The SPR effect of some metal (e.g., Au) nanoparticles as a conductive channel may provide a new means of enhancing photocatalytic efficiency [16–19]. Indeed, due to the SPR effect of Au, high-energy “hot electron–hole pairs” may be generated under visible light irradiation. By introducing Au nanoparticles into the Z-scheme ZnTiO3/CdS photocatalytic system, “hot electrons” can transfer to the VB of CdS and recombine with holes. Meanwhile, electrons from the CB of ZnTiO3 can transfer to the surface of Au and recombine with “hot holes” (with positive charges). Thus, it can be considered that the recombination of photo-generated carriers is efficiently restrained. To date, a plethora of visible-light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts have been studied and employed in environmental remediation. However, the utilization of near-infrared (NIR) light, which accounts for 44% of sunlight, has rarely been studied in the photocatalytic domain [20]. As a wide-band-gap semiconductor, ZnTiO3 only absorbs UV light to carry out photocatalytic reactions, so its utilization of solar light is severely limited. In recent years, up-conversion luminescent materials, which can absorb low-energy infrared light and convert it into high-energy visible or UV light, have attracted great interest from researchers. Among such up-converters, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ is considered as being highly efficient. The emitted high-energy visible or UV light can activate ZnTiO3 and Au nanoparticles to carry out visible-light-induced photocatalytic reactions [21]. CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ absorbs NIR light of wavelength 980 nm and emits at 410, 524, 541, and 545 nm. The wide-band-gap ZnTiO3 can fully absorb the UV light at 410 nm. At the same time, the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles is elicited in the visible region, especially when they are excited by light of wavelength 550 nm [22]. In addition, in order to increase photocatalytic hydrogen production, it is necessary to use an appropriate sacrificial agent to consume photo-generated holes [23]. Commonly used sacrificial agents include organic substances such as methanol and oxalic acid. However, due to their relatively high cost, they cannot be used on a large scale in practical applications. In fact, some organic pollutants with reducibility in wastewater can be used as sacrificial agents to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production. Norfloxacin (NOR) is one of the most widely used antibiotics around the world [24–26]. However, the production of NOR generates large amounts of effluent [27,28]. A great deal of NOR and incompletely metabolized residues are discharged into the environment, which pose a serious threat to human health [29–32]. It is feasible to carry out photocatalytic hydrogen production by utilizing wastewater containing pollutants instead of a sacrificial agent. In order to obtain a photocatalyst with rapid charge transfer and efficient light utilization for enhanced NOR degradation with simultaneous hydrogen evolution, the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst was successfully constructed by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and high-temperature calcination methods. Its photocatalytic activity was evaluated through the degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production under solar light irradiation. Various influencing factors, such as illumination time, sacrificial agent concentration, and number of reuse cycles, on the performance of the prepared system have been studied. Experimental results have shown that the prepared Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst exhibits outstanding performance in the degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production. This can mainly be attributed to the excellent light conversion performance of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ and the SPR effect of Au, which serve to effectively broaden the light response range and enhance the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs. Moreover, Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst shows excellent stability over five cycles. Furthermore, a comprehensive photocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production promoted by the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst is proposed. This work may provide new insight for the design and construction of highly efficient Z-scheme photocatalytic systems."

2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Zinc(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2 ·6H2O) and tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti) were used to synthesize ZnTiO3. Cadmium(II) chloride hemi-pentahydrate (CdCl2 ·2.5H2O) and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) were used to prepare cadmium sulfide (CdS). Calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2 ·4H2O, 99.0%), erbium oxide (Er2O3), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), and nitric acid (HNO3) were used to synthesize CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4 ·4H2O, 97%) was used to prepare Au nanoparticles to be loaded on ZnTiO3. Norfloxacin (NOR; 98% purity) was used as a target pollutant. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to adjust the pH of solutions. All chemicals were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co. and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., and were used directly without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments."
3,"Preparation of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ powder","2.2 Preparation of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ powder CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles were prepared by a hydrothermal method [33]. First, Ca(NO3)2 ∙4H2O (0.938 g, 3.97 mmol), Yb2O3 (0.2007 g, 0.51 mmol), and Er2O3 (0.0195 g, 0.05 mmol) were taken up in hot dilute aqueous HNO3 (ca. 60 °C) to obtain a clear solution. This solution was concentrated to dryness, and then deionized water (20 mL) was added to the residue. The resulting solution was adjusted to pH 1 by the addition of concentrated HNO3 and stirred for 30 min NH4F (0.5652 g, 11.30 mmol) was then slowly added, and the reaction mixture and was thoroughly stirred for 30 min. It was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After the autoclave had cooled to room temperature, the recovered material was washed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol. The obtained powder was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 500 °C for 4.0 h (attained at a heating rate of 5 °C/min)."
4,"Preparation of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 powder","2.3 Preparation of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 powder CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol–gel method [34]. Zn(NO3)2 ∙6H2O (7.12 g, 23.93 mmol) and Ti(OBu)4 (8.0 mL, 23.51 mmol) were separately dissolved in portions of anhydrous ethanol (35 mL), and then the respective solutions were mixed. After magnetic stirring at 80 °C, a yellow transparent sol was gradually formed. According to the requisite mass ratio of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ to ZnTiO3 (1.00:5.00), CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ powder (0.7718 g) was added to the sol. Upon heating, the sol gradually turned into a gel, which was dried and ground to a uniform powder. This powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 3.0 h and further heated at 800 °C for 3.0 h to afford CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 powder."

CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 (1.0 g) was immersed in HAuCl4 ·4H2O (2.1 mL) and dispersed with the aid of ultrasound for 1.0 h. The suspension was irradiated with a 64 W low-pressure mercury lamp (≤254 nm) and heated at 50 °C for 1.0 h in order to adsorb Au3+ and reduce it to Au. After repeated centrifugation, the residue was washed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C for 12 h to afford CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au powder."
6,Preparation of CdS powder,"2.5 Preparation of CdS powder CdS nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method [36]. Cd(NO3)2 (6.196 g, 6.0 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (70 mL), Na2S (4.8 g, 6.0 mmol) was added, and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min. The resulting solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL) and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and then centrifuged. Finally, the obtained CdS powder was washed several times with ethanol and deionized water, dried at 80 °C for 24 h, and ground prior to use."
7,"Preparation of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS powder","2.6 Preparation of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS powder CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS nanoparticles were prepared by isoelectric point and high-temperature calcining methods. The isoelectric point values of ZnTiO3 and CdS are pH 7.31 and pH 5.40, respectively [34,37]. CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au (0.50 g) and CdS (0.4479 g) were first dispersed in deionized water (50 mL) in a 100 mL beaker. The mixture was adjusted to pH 6.3 by the addition of acetic acid. The CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au suitably combined with CdS, and the mixture was thoroughly dispersed for 30 min to obtain a uniform suspension. The obtained CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS powder was then washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, the powder was dried at 60 °C for 12 h, then calcined at 500 °C for 2.0 h in a muffle furnace, and ground prior to use."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Crystal structures and phase compositions were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on a Bruker D-8 diffractometer (Bruker-AXS, Germany) using Ni-filtered Cu-K α radiation in the 2θ range 10–70°. Morphologies were inspected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM2100, Hitachi Corporation, Japan). Valence band structures were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an Escalab 250XI spectrometer (Thermo, USA). Surface areas were measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method on a 3H-2000PM2 apparatus (Shimadzu, Japan). Optical properties were assessed by UV/Vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) on a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs was analyzed by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy on an RF-5301PC instrument (Shimadzu, Japan). To acquire PL spectra, the powder sample was first placed in the sample tank. The appropriate filter was added and two excitation wavelengths were chosen as 203 and 395 nm, respectively. The appropriate slit size was selected to obtain the fluorescence spectrum. The transient photocurrent response (TPR) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) were measured by an electrochemical system (TPR, Xianquan 5080; EIS, Shanghai Chenhua 760E electrochemical workstation, China). The TPR was obtained under simulated sunlight by deploying the prepared sample as the working electrode, using a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was phosphate-buffered saline. The illuminated area of the photoanode surface was 2.50 × 5.00 cm2. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (LX-300, Deruifeng Hardware Electrical Appliance Businesses, China). Each TPR spectrum was measured at a bias of 0.62 V with on/off light cycles of duration 30 s. Each EIS was measured in a standard three-electrode system, with a photocatalyst-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) plate as the working electrode, a Pt plate as counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. The electrolyte consisted of potassium ferrocyanide (1 mmol/L), potassium ferricyanide (1 mmol/L), and KCl (0.1 mmol/L). A photochemical reaction apparatus was used for the experiments. The degree of degradation of NOR in aqueous solution was determined by UV/Vis spectrophotometry."
9,Photocatalytic degradation with simultaneous hydrogen evolution,"2.8 Photocatalytic degradation with simultaneous hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic activity of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS composite was assessed through the degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production under simulated solar light irradiation. A 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter served as the light source. In each degradation experiment, photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of solution and the mixture was placed in the dark with constant stirring for 30 min to attain adsorption/desorption equilibrium. During the subsequent irradiation, aliquots (4 mL) were withdrawn from the suspension at intervals of 30 min. The concentration of NOR was measured by UV/Vis spectrophotometry. After the absorbance test, the solution was poured back into the original solution in the dark. The degradation efficiency (%) was calculated according to the formula: Ct/C0 = At/A0, where A0 is the absorbance of the original NOR solution and At represents the absorbance of the NOR solution after a certain irradiation time (t). Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were conducted in a 500 mL Pyrex three-necked flask reactor at 25 °C under atmospheric pressure. The head space of the reactor was connected to an inverted burette that was filled with distilled water, thus allowing the measurement of hydrogen production. Specifically, photocatalyst (0.50 g) was dispersed in 50 mg/L NOR solution (500 mL) under magnetic stirring. Prior to irradiation, N2 was bubbled through the system for 3 min to remove dissolved O2 and maintain an anaerobic environment. Subsequently, the system was irradiated for 5.0 h. The hydrogen produced was periodically analyzed with a gas chromatograph."
10,Results and discussion,
11,XRD analyses,"3.1 XRD analyses Crystal structures and phase compositions of samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As displayed in Fig. 1 (a), the main diffraction peaks of the prepared ZnTiO3 were seen at 2θ = 21.09°, 23.84°, 32.70°, 35.22°, 40.40°, 48.87°, 52.91°, 56.74°, 61.71°, 63.35°, and 68.65°, corresponding to its (101), (102), (104), (110), (113), (204), (205), (108), (214), (300), and (208) facets, respectively (JCPDS #14–0033) [37]. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), the diffraction peaks of the prepared CdS appeared at 2θ = 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 36.62°, 43.68°, 47.84°, 51.82°, and 66.77°, in good agreement with the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (203) facets, respectively, of its hexagonal phase (JCPDS #41–1049) [38]. In Fig. 1 (c), the characteristic diffraction peaks can be seen at 2θ = 28.27°, 32.76°, 47.00°, 55.76°, and 68.67°, attributable to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (400) facets of CaF2, respectively (JCPDS #35–0816) [39]. No impurity peaks could be discerned in the aforementioned three patterns, implying that the prepared samples were pure. As can be seen in Fig. 1 (e), the characteristic diffraction peaks of both CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ and ZnTiO3 were clearly resolved, indicating that coated CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 had been successfully prepared. As depicted in Fig. 1 (f), besides the characteristic diffraction peaks of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ and ZnTiO3, two pronounced peaks due to Au at 2θ = 38.18° and 44.39° could also be seen, matching those in Fig. 1 (d) (JCPDS #04–0784), consistent with the loading of Au nanoparticles on the surface of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3. In Fig. 1 (g), the characteristic diffraction peaks of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, ZnTiO3, and Au can all be seen. Besides, diffraction peaks due to CdS can also be discerned. The above results confirmed successful preparation of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst."
12,SEM analyses,"3.2 SEM analyses The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were investigated by SEM. In Fig. 2 (a), it can be seen that the CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles of diameters 30–50 nm exhibited near-spherical morphology. In general, the solubility of trivalent rare-earth ions in a fluorite phase is known to be about 40%. Therefore, Yb3+ and Er3+ ions can be considered as being maximally incorporated into the fluoride crystal lattice [40]. As displayed in Fig. 2 (b), the ZnTiO3 sample consisted of irregularly shaped particles with smooth surfaces and sizes in the range 100–200 nm, allowing them to be coated with CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles. In Fig. 2 (c), it can intuitively be seen that the nano-sized CdS particles were irregular spheres with diameters in the range 25–35 nm. An SEM image of coated CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 is presented in Fig. 2 (d), which shows a remarkable increase in particle size after introducing CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+. In addition, the size distribution of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 is shown in Figs. 2 (d-1). It can be seen that the particle sizes of ZnTiO3 were mainly distributed in the range 173.97 ± 48.93 nm. After coating with CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, the particle sizes became much larger. Furthermore, spherical CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ particles can no longer be distinctly discerned in Fig. 2 (d), implying that the vast majority of them had been coated on ZnTiO3. Fig. 2 (e) shows a similar situation, but with some granular nanoparticles with smaller diameters of 10–18 nm attached to the surface of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3, which are believed to be Au nanoparticles. Indeed, the surface of the ZnTiO3 is no longer smooth due to the deposition of these Au nanoparticles. Fig. 2 (f) shows a similar situation as in Fig. 2 (d, e), but with some small-sized CdS particles adhered to CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au, forming the CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS composite."
13,EDX analyses,"3.3 EDX analyses The elemental composition and content ratio of the final product were analyzed by EDX spectroscopy. As displayed in Fig. 3 , the characteristic peaks of Cd and S can be prominently discerned, confirming the presence of CdS. Moreover, the weight % and atom % are approximately consistent with those of CdS. Peaks due to Zn, Ti, and O can be detected, as befits ZnTiO3. Furthermore, peaks due to Ca, F, Yb, and Er can also be observed, corresponding to the composition of the up-conversion luminescence agent (CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+). Most notably, peaks due to Au can be seen in the EDX pattern, corroborating the presence of Au atoms with SPR effect that can provide conductive channels. These observations are consistent with the XRD and SEM results. The atom proportions are in line with the theoretical molar ratio in CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS, indicating successful preparation of the predicted Z-scheme photocatalyst."
14,TEM analyses,"3.4 TEM analyses The microstructures of the prepared samples were investigated by TEM. It can be observed from Fig. 4 (a) that four substantially different particles were clustered together, with a coated structure apparent in the center of the image. The darker region is assigned as CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ and the lighter region is assigned as ZnTiO3. Therefore, it can be concluded that a coated structure of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 was indeed prepared. In the upper-left region of the CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 particle, a light-gray spherical particle can be discerned, which is presumed to be an Au nanoparticle. It can also be seen that this Au nanoparticle is connected to a darker particle. Combined with the SEM analysis, we surmise that this is a CdS particle. Furthermore, in Fig. 4 (b), the detailed microstructure and specific connection mode of the as-prepared sample is demonstrated by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The lattice fringe of 0.384 nm is in accordance with the (102) crystal plane of hexagonal ZnTiO3. In addition, an area within the ZnTiO3 contains a fringe of 0.270 nm, which may be attributed to the up-conversion fluorescent agent CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+. At the top-right of the image, a lattice fringe of 0.299 nm can be seen, which is consistent with the (101) crystal plane of CdS. A lattice fringe of 0.240 nm is also seen between CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 and CdS, which can be ascribed to an Au nanoparticle. Fig. 4 (c) clearly shows the relationship of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ and ZnTiO3 in the coated CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3. The above analyses further corroborated successful preparation of the predicted Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst. Fig. 4 (d) shows the TEM-EDS elemental mappings of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS. As marked by green boxes in Figs. 4 (d-0), CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ in the upper-right of the image is coated on ZnTiO3. CdS, composed of Cd and S, appears at the bottom left. Between ZnTiO3 and CdS, Au nanoparticles are seen to be loaded. Moreover, the images of the individual elements in Figs. 4 (d-1)–(d-10) confirm that they were uniformly distributed in the prepared sample. These results further corroborate successful formation of the proposed Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst."
15,XPS analyses,"3.5 XPS analyses The prepared CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst was fully characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine its elemental composition and chemical states. The full survey in Fig. 5 (a) clearly indicates the presence of Zn, Ti, Cd, S, Au, Ca, F, Yb, Er, and O. As shown in Fig. 5 (b), two peaks at 1021.89 and 1044.75 eV correspond to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, and are characteristic of Zn2+ in ZnTiO3 [34]. As displayed in Fig. 5 (c), two peaks at 451.20 and 458.67 eV can be attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, of ZnTiO3 [34]. Fig. 5 (d) shows the XPS pattern of Cd in the sample. The peaks centered at 405.42 and 412.22 eV correspond to the inner electrons of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively, illustrating that Cd in the sample existed in the form of Cd2+ [41]. Fig. 5 (e) features two peaks at 168.45 and 169.75 eV corresponding to the characteristic signals of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, in good accordance with S2− [42]. As displayed in Fig. 5 (f), peaks located at 347.89 and 350.82 eV can be ascribed to Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2 of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, respectively. In Fig. 5 (g), the peak located at 684.40 eV can be ascribed to the signal of F 1s, and demonstrates that the valence state of F was −1 [43]. In Fig. 5 (h), the peak at 187.10 eV can be assigned to Yb [33]. Fig. 5 (i) shows the XPS pattern of Er. The peaks at binding energies of 168.90 and 170.10 eV correspond to 4d7/2 and 4d5/2, respectively, of Er [44]. In Fig. 5 (j), two peaks can be observed at 87.20 and 89.75 eV, attributable to Au7/2 and Au5/2, respectively. Compared with standard Au, there is a slight shift in the direction of higher energy, indicating that it can be an electron medium [45]. In Fig. 5 (k), three peaks can be seen at 529.16, 529.87, and 531.18 eV, attributable to lattice oxygen atoms in ZnTiO3, surface hydroxyl groups, and adsorbed water molecules, respectively [46]. The above analyses further infer that the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst had been successfully prepared."
16,BET analyses,"3.6 BET analyses N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/CdS, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3, CdS, and ZnTiO3 are illustrated in Fig. 6 . Obviously, all of these samples displayed increased N2 adsorption with the increase of relative pressure (P/P0). It can be seen that the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst showed a hysteresis loop with type IV isotherms, proving the formation of a mesoporous structure, and this sample also showed the highest BET surface area (33.705 m2/g). In comparison, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/CdS, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au, and CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 exhibited somewhat inferior adsorption properties, reflecting their lower BET surface areas of 29.899, 26.311, and 18.116 m2/g, respectively. This reveals that construction of the Z-scheme photocatalyst generates a large surface area. Compared to the composites, CdS and ZnTiO3 have much lower surface areas of 7.571 and 4.380 m2/g, respectively. In summary, the above analysis results prove that the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst has a large surface area and excellent adsorption properties."
17,DRS analyses,"3.7 DRS analyses The optical properties of the as-prepared samples were examined by UV/Vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and the results are displayed in Fig. 7 (a). As can be seen, the prepared ZnTiO3 particles exhibited an absorption edge at 410 nm, indicating that they absorb in the UV region. CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 showed an absorption edge at 414 nm. This slight red shift illustrates that CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ has a certain influence on the absorption edge of ZnTiO3. The prepared CdS showed an absorption edge at 560 nm, demonstrating that it absorbs both UV and visible light. Notably, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au and CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS displayed absorption in the visible light range, which can be attributed to the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles under excitation with visible light (the green ellipse). Moreover, compared with CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS absorbed over a wide portion of the visible range of sunlight. This can mainly be attributed to the combination of CdS and CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au forming a Z-scheme photocatalytic system, significantly broadening the light response range. The band gaps of the prepared samples were calculated by the Kubelka–Munk function [47]: αhν = A(hν–Ebg)1/2, where α, h, ν, Ebg, and A denote the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, light frequency, band-gap energy, and a constant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 (b-1) and (b-2), Ebg values for the prepared ZnTiO3 and CdS were calculated as 3.04 and 2.34 eV, respectively, similar to those reported in the literature [21,32]. To verify the CB and VB potentials of ZnTiO3 and CdS, their flat-band potentials (Efb) were measured, and the Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Fig. 7 (c-1) and (c-2), respectively. The Efb of ZnTiO3 and CdS were estimated as −0.34 eV and −0.70 eV vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, by the extrapolation of plots (1/C2 = 0), proving that they are both n-type semiconductors. The Efb were then converted into normal H2 electrode (NHE) potentials by using the following equation: Efb (vs. NHE) = Efb (pH = 0, vs. Ag/AgCl) + EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH, where EAgCl = 0.197 V at 25 °C and the electrolyte is of pH 5.8. Thus, the calculated Efb of ZnTiO3 and CdS are approximately 0.20 eV and −0.16 eV vs. NHE, respectively. As the Efb (vs. NHE) is usually 0.3 eV more positive than the CB minimum (CBM) for an n-type semiconductor, ECB of ZnTiO3 and CdS are about −0.10 eV and −0.46 eV, respectively. According to the Ebg and ECB of ZnTiO3 and CdS, their EVB values were calculated as about +2.94 eV and +1.88 eV, respectively."
18,PL analyses,"3.8 PL analyses Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was employed to study the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst during the photocatalytic reaction process. For comparison, the PL emission spectra of ZnTiO3 and CdS were also determined, as shown in Fig. 8 . The recombination of electrons and holes generates the PL emission signal. In general, a lower PL intensity is indicative of a lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. ZnTiO3, CdS, and CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS all show PL spectra in the wavelength range 300–700 nm. It can be clearly seen that ZnTiO3 and CdS gave high PL intensities, reflecting high recombination rates. In comparison, the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst exhibited the lowest PL intensity, reflecting much more efficient separation of photo-generated carriers. The enhanced separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs can be ascribed to construction of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system and the Au SPR effect. Due to the SPR effect, Au nanoparticles act as a highly efficient electron sink between CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3 and CdS, and can quickly transfer electrons from the CB of ZnTiO3 to the VB of CdS, inhibiting the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs."
19,TPR analyses,"3.9 TPR analyses The transient photo-current response (TPR) was measured to further evaluate the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Fig. 9 (a) shows the photocurrent–time traces of ZnTiO3, CdS, and the CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation over five periodic on/off cycles. The Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst clearly exhibited a much stronger photocurrent intensity than the individual components (ZnTiO3 and CdS). In addition, it is worth noting that the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst exhibited a steady photocurrent intensity when illuminated. These results corroborate that a strong separation ability of photo-generated carriers can be obtained in the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst."
20,EIS analyses,"3.10 EIS analyses Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to further explore the transfer efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Generally speaking, a smaller arc radius represents a higher separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. As displayed in Fig. 9 (b), the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst showed a much smaller arc radius than those of ZnTiO3 and CdS, indicating that it can more efficiently facilitate transfer of photo-generated electrons. In particular, through the SPR effect, similar to an electron injector, Au nanoparticles between ZnTiO3 and CdS can effectively accelerate electron transfer from the CB of ZnTiO3 to the VB of CdS. In this way, the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst shows superior performance in the photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production."
21,Photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples,"3.11 Photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated through the photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production under simulated solar light irradiation, and the results are presented in Figs. 10 and 11 . As shown in Fig. 10, prior to solar light irradiation, each suspension was placed in the dark for 30 min under constant stirring to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium. From the experiments conducted in the dark, it can be seen that, with all five systems, the NOR concentration decreased slightly within 30 min, illustrating that all of the prepared photocatalysts have a certain adsorption capacity for NOR. Meanwhile, it was found that, under solar light irradiation, the amount of NOR showed only a slight decrease without any photocatalyst, illustrating a negligible photobleaching effect on NOR. As shown in Fig. 10 (a), when the mixed solutions were irradiated with solar light, the concentrations of NOR gradually decreased with increasing irradiation time. The Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst clearly displayed the highest degree of degradation. Indeed, the degree of degradation of NOR reached 92.05% after solar light irradiation for 180 min. In comparison, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/CdS, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3, ZnTiO3, and CdS exhibited relatively low photocatalytic activities. Under the same conditions, the degrees of degradation of NOR were 80.66%, 74.00%, 63.20%, 34.80%, and 30.10%, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 10 (b), the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of NOR at different concentrations were investigated. Under visible light irradiation for 180 min, the degrees of degradation of NOR were 90.23%, 84.80%, 72.00%, 68.72%, and 60.03%, for 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/L concentrations of NOR, respectively. It can be observed that the optimum NOR concentration was 10 mg/L. This may have been because excessive NOR molecules in solution result in their inter-shielding, reducing the efficiency of their degradation. Fig. 11 (a) shows the effect of irradiation time on photocatalytic hydrogen production for CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/CdS, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3, CdS, and ZnTiO3. The hydrogen production amounts are all seen to increase with increasing solar light irradiation time. CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS showed the highest hydrogen production, amounting to 513.39 μmol/g after 5.0 h under the specified conditions. This photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen also proceeded without any sacrificial agent, although the amount of hydrogen produced was quite low, only reaching 101.93 μmol/g after 5.0 h. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sacrificial agent plays an important role in photocatalytic hydrogen production. It continually consumes photo-generated holes to effectively increase hydrogen production. As displayed in Fig. 11 (b), after simulated solar irradiation of a 50 mg/L NOR solution for 5.0 h, the highest hydrogen production (511.99 μmol/g) was obtained. This is significantly higher than the hydrogen productions of 430.01 μmol/g from 30 mg/L NOR solution and 212.03 μmol/g from 10 mg/L NOR solution. It can be concluded that 50 mg/L NOR was more favorable for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the following aspects. Firstly, construction of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalytic system provides a relatively positive VB potential and a relatively negative CB potential. Thereby, strong oxidation and reduction capabilities are obtained. Secondly, the introduction of Au nanoparticles with SPR effect connecting ZnTiO3 and CdS as a conductive channel accelerates the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the CB of ZnTiO3 to the VB of CdS, effectively suppressing the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Finally, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, as an up-converting luminescent agent, serves to intensify the excitation of ZnTiO3 in the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst by providing high-energy UV light. Moreover, the visible light emitted by CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ excites Au nanoparticles to generate the SPR effect. Besides photocatalytic efficiency, the stability of a photocatalyst is also an important factor for next-step practical application. Therefore, the stability of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS was studied over five successive cycles. As shown in Fig. 12 (a), only a small decrease from 91.10% to 88.70% in the degree of degradation of NOR was incurred after five cycles, illustrating good stability of the photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 12 (b), hydrogen production decreased only slightly from 188.24 to 184.89 μmol/g over the five cycles, further corroborating the high stability. Based on the experimental results, it can be concluded that CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS is a stable Z-scheme photocatalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production. Fig. 12 (c) displays the characteristic XRD peak positions of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst before and after use. It can be seen that these XRD peak positions remained essentially unchanged. However, there were some slight decreases in peak intensities, which may be attributed to some destruction of the photocatalyst. Nevertheless, repeated experiments demonstrated that the photocatalyst maintained high stability for the photocatalytic reaction. Comparing the SEM image in Fig. 12 (d) with that in Fig. 2 (f), it can be seen that the morphology was essentially unchanged before and after use. Therefore, after long-term tests, there were no noticeable changes in the morphology or composition of the used photocatalyst. The XPS pattern of the used catalyst is presented in Fig. 12 (e). It can be observed that the peak positions of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst before and after use were basically the same. Thus, the XPS results showed the photocatalyst to be highly stable, such that it may be reused multiple times. In addition, for a more rigorous comparison, the XPS patterns of each of the elements present, Zn 2p, Ti 2p, Cd 3d, S 2p, Ca 2p, F 1s, Yb 4d, Er 4d, Au 4f, and O 1s, of the photocatalyst before and after use are shown in Fig. S12. These XPS patterns further confirmed the stability of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst."
22,"Analysis of the up-conversion luminescence spectrum and schematic energy level diagram of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+","3.12 Analysis of the up-conversion luminescence spectrum and schematic energy level diagram of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ Up-conversion luminescent materials convert long-wavelength light into short-wavelength light. That is, through processes of energy conversion and electron transition, they can absorb low-energy light and emit high-energy light, such as visible or UV light [48]. In general, up-conversion luminescent materials are composed of some rare-earth elements and a matrix material. The rare-earth elements, such as Yb and Er, are generally selected as activator and sensitizer, respectively. These rare-earth elements have abundant energy levels and long luminescence lifetimes. Fluorides show excellent characteristics of large transmittance range, low phonon energy (ca. 350 cm−1), and good chemical stability [21], and so are often used as matrix materials for up-conversion luminescent materials. In this work, in order to maintain high stability in the photocatalytic reaction process, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ as an up-conversion luminescent material was applied to ZnTiO3. The up-conversion emission spectrum of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ excited by a 980 nm diode laser and the corresponding energy-transfer mechanism in the up-conversion process are presented in Fig. 13 (a, b). In Fig. 13 (a), a UV emission peak is seen at 410 nm, corresponding to the transition 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 in Fig. 13 (b). Thus, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ emits UV light upon excitation with light of wavelength 980 nm. A relatively weak green emission peak can be seen at 524 nm, corresponding to the transition 2H11/2 → 4I15/2. Two strong green emission peaks are seen at 541 and 545 nm, corresponding to the transitions 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H9/2 → 4I13/2, respectively. Apparently, ZnTiO3 (λex ≤ 410 nm) and Au (λex = 500–580 nm) can take full advantage of the light emitted by CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ to perform the photocatalytic reaction and generate the SPR effect, respectively. The light response range of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst is thereby obviously widened. To sum up, the presence of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ helps the Z-scheme ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst to effectively perform the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics with simultaneous hydrogen production."
23,Possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production,"3.13 Possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production Trapping experiments of the generated active species were performed by adding different trapping agents to explore the photocatalytic reaction mechanism, and the results are displayed in Fig. 14 (a). Ammonium oxalate (AO), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) were used as trapping agents for holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and superoxide radicals (•O2 −) [49], respectively. Under simulated solar light irradiation without any trapping agents, the degree of degradation of NOR was 89.95%. However, after adding AO and IPA to the aqueous NOR solution under otherwise identical conditions, the degrees of degradation were drastically reduced to 55.56% and 38.99%, respectively. In comparison, the degree of degradation was reduced to 75.62% in the presence of BQ, indicating a relatively small change. It can be concluded that the degree of photocatalytic degradation of NOR is suppressed by addition of the trapping agents AO, IPA, and BQ. Their influences are in the order AO > IPA > BQ. These results implicate h+ and •OH as the predominant active species in the degradation of NOR. In order to prove the mineralization of NOR induced by the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst under solar light irradiation, the variation in total organic carbon (TOC) over 120 min was tested, and the results are displayed in Fig. 14 (b). It can be seen that the amount of organic carbon in the suspension showed a much more marked downward trend compared with that without catalyst. Consequently, the prepared Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst can effectively mineralize NOR under solar light irradiation over an extended period. These results confirm that the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst can effectively remove organic pollutants from aqueous solution. To further probe the photocatalytic reaction mechanism of the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst, electron spin resonance (ESR) was determined to analyze the active species after 10 min of illumination and under dark conditions. As displayed in Fig. 15 (a), three intense ESR signals (1:1:1) were observed under dark conditions, attributable to the spin-trapping agent TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl). After 10 min under visible light illumination, the response signals were significantly attenuated due to TEMPO combining with h+ to form the spin adduct [50]. This implies that abundant h+ are produced during the photocatalytic reaction. As a trapping agent of free radicals, DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) can trap •OH (hydroxyl radical) and •O2 − (superoxide radical) to produce response signals [51]. In Fig. 15 (b, c), no response signals were elicited under dark conditions, implying that no •OH or •O2 − were generated without irradiation. However, ESR signals of both •OH (1:2:2:1) and •O2 − (1:1:1:1) were clearly detected after visible light irradiation for 10 min. Based on the above analysis, it can be surmised that h+, •OH, and •O2 − may play dominant roles in the photocatalytic degradation process. Based on the above discussions, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production under simulated solar light irradiation may be proposed, which is illustrated schematically in Fig. 16 . For photocatalytic degradation with simultaneous hydrogen production, a single semiconductor photocatalyst generally displays a high recombination rate of electron–hole pairs and a low utilization level of light in practical application. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a semiconductor photocatalyst with a more negative CB potential to couple with another semiconductor photocatalyst with a more positive VB potential, forming a new photocatalytic system with both strong reducing and strong oxidizing capabilities. We selected ZnTiO3 (ECB = −0.10 eV, EVB = +2.94 eV, ΔEbg = +3.04 eV) with a wide band gap and CdS (ECB = −0.46 eV, EVB = +1.88 eV, ΔEbg = +2.34 eV) with a narrow band gap to form a new ideal Z-scheme photocatalytic system. The direction of electron transfer is from the CB of ZnTiO3 to the VB of CdS due to their well-matched band structures. The VB with more positive potential for ZnTiO3 and the CB with more negative potential for CdS can be simultaneously preserved. In this way, the desired strong reducing and strong oxidizing capabilities are obtained. As a broad band-gap semiconductor photocatalyst, ZnTiO3 can only absorb UV light to effectively carry out photocatalytic reactions. CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, as an up-converting luminescent agent, absorbs NIR light (λ = 980 nm) from the solar spectrum and converts it into UV (400–420 nm) and visible (500–580 nm) light. In this work, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ was coated on ZnTiO3. On the one hand, the UV light emitted from CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ is effectively absorbed by ZnTiO3 to generate electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, the visible light emitted from CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ induces the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles. Due to this SPR effect, Au nanoparticles provide conductive channels and generate “hot electrons” with higher energy states, accelerating electron transfer from the CB of ZnTiO3 to the VB of CdS. Therefore, under solar light irradiation, the dual effects of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ boost the photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 16, under simulated solar light irradiation in the presence of CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, ZnTiO3 and CdS can both be excited to generate electron–hole pairs. At the same time, the generated “hot electrons” around Au nanoparticles are injected into the VB of CdS and combine with holes. Electrons in the CB of ZnTiO3 immediately transfer to the surface of Au nanoparticles to neutralize positive charges. Apparently, because of the SPR effect, Au nanoparticles can serve as both electron donors and electron acceptors. Therefore, formation of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system with SPR effect confers both strong oxidizing potential and strong reducing potential in redox reactions. In the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst, the accumulated photo-generated holes in the VB of ZnTiO3 are capable of directly degrading NOR to CO2, H2O, and some inorganic ions, and of oxidizing H2O/OH− (E(•OH/H2O) = +2.38 eV vs. NHE) to •OH, because the VB potential (+2.94 eV vs. NHE) of ZnTiO3 is sufficiently positive [52–54]. Meanwhile, the accumulated photo-generated electrons in the CB (ECB = −0.46 eV vs. NHE) of CdS combine with H+ to form H2 (E(H+/H2) = 0.000 eV vs. NHE). Overall, based on the above specific transfer path of photo-generated electrons in the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst, the reducing ability of photo-generated electrons and the oxidizing capability of photo-generated holes are both obviously strengthened. The constant consumption of h+ in the VB of ZnTiO3 promotes the continuous generation of e− in the CB of CdS. Conversely, the constant consumption of e− in the CB of CdS promotes the generation of h+ in the VB of ZnTiO3. The photocatalytic degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production is thus doubly promoted in the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalytic system. The overall mechanism can be summarized as follows: CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS + near-infrared light (in solar light) → [CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+]*@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS [CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+]*@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS → hν (λ = 400–420 nm) + hν (λ = 500–580 nm) CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS + hν (λ = 400–420 nm) → CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@[ZnTiO3]*/Au/CdS CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@[ZnTiO3]*/Au/CdS → h+/VB/ZnTiO3 + e–/CB/ZnTiO3 CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS + visible light (in solar light) → CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/[CdS]* CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/[CdS]* → h+/VB/CdS + e–/CB/CdS CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS + hν (λ = 500–580 nm) → CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/[Au]*(SPR)/CdS CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/[Au]*(SPR)/CdS → e–/Au + h+/Au e–/Au + h+/VB/CdS → hν or heat h+/Au + e–/CB/ZnTiO3 → hν or heat H+ + e–/CB/CdS → 1/2H2 Organic pollutants + h+/VB/ZnTiO3 → D+ → → D++ → → → CO2 + H2O + inorganic ions H2O + h+/VB/ZnTiO3 → •OH + H+ Organic pollutants + •OH → D+ → → D++ → → → CO2 + H2O + inorganic ions"
24,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst has been successfully prepared by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and high-temperature calcination methods. It exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in the degradation of NOR with simultaneous hydrogen production. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, construction of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system maintains a relatively positive VB potential and a relatively negative CB potential. Secondly, due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, Au nanoparticles provide conductive channels, accelerating the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the CB of ZnTiO3 to the VB of CdS. Thirdly, CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+, as an up-converting luminescent agent, converts low-energy NIR light into high-energy UV and visible light, intensifying the excitation of ZnTiO3 and the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles. As a result, a high degree of photocatalytic degradation (92.05%) of NOR and high hydrogen production (513.39 μmol/g) were obtained after solar light irradiation for 5.0 h. Besides, the Z-scheme CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+@ZnTiO3/Au/CdS photocatalyst also displays outstanding recyclability and stability for repeated photocatalytic reactions."
