0,Introduction,"Trichloroethylene (TCE), as one of the most frequently used chlorinated organic solvent, has been released into environment for decades (Jia et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2018). Due to the strong migration capability, TCE with a trace concentration is widely detected in soils and groundwater (Huang et al., 2014; Moran et al., 2007). TCE brings potential damages to the nervous system and reproductive system of human (Watson et al., 2006; Zenick et al., 1984). Reductive dechlorination of TCE to non-chlorinated products is an efficient way to detoxify TCE. Since the pH of groundwater is usually neutral, dechlorinating TCE at neutral pH is desired for the remediation of TCE-contaminated groundwater. Some natural-occurring minerals show dechlorination activity towards TCE in soil and aquatic environment (Jeong and Hayes 2007; Kim et al., 2008). However, these minerals are limited by their weak reductive capability for TCE, which lead to the formation of toxic incomplete dechlorination products such as dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) (Drake et al., 2006; Han et al., 2012). The formation of complete dechlorination products is favored in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H•) which is a highly reactive reductant (E0 = –2.1 V vs RHE) for dechlorination (Liu et al., 2018). Lots of transition metals, such as Cu, Ni, Pd, Ag etc., are reported to catalyze the formation of H• (Parshetti and Doong 2009; Ran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2008; Wu and Feng 2016). These transition metals show high electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination performance by generating H•, avoiding the production of toxic incomplete dechlorination products (Lee et al., 2013; Lou et al., 2019). However, the fabrication of electrocatalytic cathode is complex and the electrochemical process needs additional electricity input, which restricts their practical applications (Skadberg and Geoly-Horn 1999; Yao et al., 2019). The bimetallic nanoparticles consisting of nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) and a second catalytic metal also catalyze the generation of H• in water, which is promising for groundwater remediation (Fang et al., 2018; He et al., 2018). However, nanoparticles such as nZVI is relatively expensive (Yang et al., 2020). Also, a passive metal oxide layer readily forms on the surface of nanoparticles in water, which inhibit the electron transfer and reduce the yield of H• (Doong and Lai 2005; Shen et al., 2018). Therefore, finding an efficient, stable and easy-to-operate technique for H• generation is urgent for TCE removal. Ni atoms in synthesized Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDH) can provide H• adsorption sites to enhance the dissociation of water (Gong et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019), which are widely used as an electro-catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (He et al., 2019; Ishizaki et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). For HER, electron was donated by cathode and transferred by Ni-Fe hydroxides framework. Inspired by this Ni-Fe LDH catalyzed HER process, we speculated that electrons might also be donated by Fe2+, which lead to the generation of H• by Ni-Fe hydroxides with Fe2+ and Ni2+ in the metal framework. The cooccurrence of Ni2+and Fe2+in anoxic groundwater has been reported (Larsen and Postma 1997; Lee et al., 2007). Although the cooccurrence of Ni2+and Fe2+ is not common and the concentration of Fe2+is usually higher than that of Ni2+ if they cooccur due to the abundance of iron minerals in subsurface environment (Wang et al., 2021), the hydroxylation of Fe2+ and Ni2+ causing the formation of Ni-Fe hydroxides in natural environment at near-neutral pH cannot be ignored. Natural-occurring iron-based LDH mostly have Fe3+ in the metal framework, because Fe2+ is readily oxidized in an ambient environment due to its strong reducibility (Fang et al., 2019b; Huang et al., 2018). The generation of H• during the electron release process from Ni-Fe hydroxides is rarely investigated. It has been reported that TCE usually coexists with heavy metals such as Fe and Ni in groundwater (Jeong and Hayes 2007). However, the natural attenuation of TCE in the presence of Ni2+ and Fe2+ under neutral conditions has been scarcely studied. In this work, H•-involved dechlorination of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides at neutral pH was reported for the first time. The generation of H• was confirmed by electrochemical analysis and quenching experiments. The utilization and selectivity efficiency of electrons were calculated, and the morphological change of Ni-Fe hydroxides after the hydrodechlorination was studied. The mechanism of H•-involved hydrodechlorination is revealed by various crystallographic, microscopic, and surface chemistry methods."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals FeCl2, NiCl2•6H2O, NaOH, HCl, tert‑butyl alcohol (TBA), 1,10-phenanthroline and TCE were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The dechlorination intermediates of TCE were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were analytical reagents. Aqueous reagents were prepared using oxygen-free ultrapure water (electrical conductivity = 18.25 MΩ/cm) and stored in an anoxic glovebox filled with Ar gas with a purity of 99.9%. Gaseous acetylene (C2H2), ethene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6) and argon were provided by Wuhan Zhongxinruiyuan gases Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China)."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Firstly, Ni-Fe hydroxides were synthesized in anoxic glovebox. The synthesis method of Ni-Fe hydroxides was detailed in Text S1. Ni-Fe hydroxides suspension (1.0 mL) was moved into 10 mL glass vials and 4.0 mL oxygen-free ultrapure water was added into glass vials. The pH value of solution in glass vials was adjusted using 10 mM NaOH. Twenty-five µL saturated aqueous solution of TCE (8.37 mM) was injected into the 5.0 mL Ni-Fe hydroxides suspensions to obtain a TCE concentration of 42 µM, which was then immediately capped with Teflon-lined lids. All the experiments were conducted in an anoxic glovebox. The reaction vials were shaken in a rotary agitator at 40 rpm. The transformation from C2H4 to C2H6 was observed in a 50 mL glass vials with 25 mL Ni-Fe hydroxides suspension and 25 mL headspace. The injection port was sealed with a flexible Teflon gasket. Samples were collected at different time intervals and were immediately analyzed."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods A headspace autosampler Triplus300HS coupled to a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector and flame ionization detector (GC-ECD/FID, Shimadzu, GC2010, Japan) was used to determine the concentration of TCE and corresponding dechlorination intermediates and products. The temperature of the Triplus300HS headspace sampler system was set at 30 °C for incubating oven before headspace sampling process. The chromatographic conditions were set as following: front inlet at 85 °C with split flow at 60 mL/min (equivalent to a split ratio of 20), constant flow mode used for front inlet with the flow rate at 1.2 mL/min, ECD detector at 250 °C with makeup (N2) gas flow at 15.0 mL/min, FID detector at 300 °C with airflow at 350 mL/min, H2 flow at 40 mL/min and makeup gas flow at 39.0 mL/min. The oven temperature was set at 250 °C. H2 was detected using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD). The content of Fe2+ and Fe3+ were determined using 1,10-phenanthroline. The conformations of Ni-Fe hydroxides with different Ni/Fe ratios were optimized using density functional theory (DFT). The computation details of DFT were shown in Text S2."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The information about collection and preservation of the formed Ni-Fe hydroxides were described in Text S3. The crystal structure of Ni-Fe hydroxides after reaction was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, PANalytical, Netherlands). The chemical composition of Ni-Fe hydroxides was characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo VG Scientific, USA). The microscopic morphology of Ni-Fe hydroxides was analyzed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) equipping with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Electrochemical analyses, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 600E, CH Instruments, USA) equipping a rotating disk electrode (RRDE, Taizhou Keruite Analytical Instrument, China). The operation of electrochemical characterization was detailed in Text S4. After reaction, the supernatant in glass vial was obtained by filtrating and the concentration of dissolved metals in solution was investigated by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES730, Agilent, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fast dechlorination of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides at neutral pH,"3.1 Fast dechlorination of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides at neutral pH The removal of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides at neutral pH was fast with the removal efficiency reached 80.9% after 110 min of reaction (Fig. 1 a). The mass-normalized pseudo first-order rate constants (kM ) was 1.4 ± 0.1 L•h − 1•g − 1 which was higher than most of the reported iron-based reductants (supplementary Table S1). During TCE reduction, trace concentrations of intermediates such as cis-DCE and 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE) were detected (supplementary Fig. S1). Ethylene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6) as the complete dechlorination products of TCE were identified (supplementary Fig. S2), whose contents were 29.3% and 35.8% after 110 min of reaction, respectively. The hydroxylation of Fe2+ or Ni2+ at neutral pH leads to the formation of Fe(OH)2 or Ni(OH)2. TCE removal was negligible in the presence of Fe(OH)2, Ni(OH)2 or the physical mixture of Fe(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 after 24 h (supplementary Fig. S3), demonstrating Fe(OH)2 or Ni(OH)2 alone cannot reduce TCE effectively. In contrast, the efficient transformation from TCE to C2H4 and C2H6 demonstrated the extremely strong reducing activity of Ni-Fe hydroxides. The precipitated particles formed after reaction were collected for characterization. TEM image of the particles shows a typical hexagonal morphology of layered double hydroxide (LDH) with a lateral size of ∼600 nm (Fig. 1b) (Fang et al., 2019c; Yin et al., 2018). The EDX spectra confirmed the Ni/Fe ratio of the as-formed Ni-Fe hydroxide is 3.0 (Fig. 1c, supplementary Table S2). XRD patterns (Fig. 1d) shows the diffraction peaks at 11.1°, 21.8°, 30.6° and 43.7° corresponding to (003), (006), (012) and (018) reflections of Ni-Fe LDH interlayered with Cl– anions (JCPDS No.40–0216) (Duo et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2019a). In addition, the two diffraction peaks at 13.5° and 26.9° can be assigned to Fe(OH)3 (JCPDS No.38–0032). High-resolution Ni 2p XPS (Fig. 1e) shows the peaks at 855.7 and 861.8 eV belonging to Ni2+(Shen et al., 2018). High-resolution Fe 2p XPS (Fig. 1f) indicates Fe2+ (710.6 and 723.9 eV) and Fe3+ (712.5 and 725.9 eV) existed in the particles after reaction (Gan et al., 2020). These results demonstrate that Fe2+ is the only electron donor during the hydrodechlorination of TCE. After electrons transferring from Ni-Fe hydroxides to TCE, Ni-Fe hydroxides were transformed to Ni-Fe LDH and Fe(OH)3 was also formed as confirmed by XRD data (Fig. 1d). It should be noted that the Ni2+ and Fe2+ cations at neutral pH may undergo very fast transformation from hydroxylated polycations, Ni-Fe hydroxide to Ni-Fe LDH. One can see the immediate color change and formation of precipitations during the aging process of Ni2+ and Fe2+ cations at neutral pH (supplementary Fig. S4). Although the characterization of the materials before reaction was done as fast as possible, only Ni-Fe LDH as the final transformed product was observed (supplementary Fig. S5). Thus, ex-situ solid-state characterization could not capture the structural information of these ultrafast involved materials before reaction, and sophisticated in-situ characterization techquies are required."
8,Effect of metal dosage and pH,"3.2 Effect of metal dosage and pH Hydrodechlorination of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides with various metal dosages was investigated (supplementary Fig. S6). TCE removal efficiency increased greatly with increasing the metal dosage. The pseudo first-order kinetics reaction rate constants (k’) with different metal dosages were 0.006 min–1 (Ni = 3 mM, Fe = 1 mM), 0.017 min–1 (Ni = 6 mM, Fe = 2 mM), 0.047 min–1 (Ni = 12 mM, Fe = 3 mM) and 0.127 min–1 (Ni = 18 mM, Fe = 6 mM). The k’ values increase linearly with the metal dosage (Fig. 2 a), demonstrating high concentration of Ni-Fe hydroxides enhance the removal of TCE. The concentration of DCE was extremely low indicating the half-life of chlorinated intermediates were short during the TCE hydrodechlorination process (Fig. 2b). Also, the peak of DCE concentration moved forward with increasing metal dosage, which was attribute to the accelerated hydrodechlorination rates for the reduction of TCE to DCE. The yield of C2H6 increased significantly with increasing metal dosage from 4, 8, 16 to 24 mM, which were 9.3%, 35.8%, 70.5% and 84.5% after 110 min, respectively (Fig. 2c). The production of C2H4 increased with reaction time when metal dosages were 4 and 8 mM (Fig. 2d). However, the concentration of C2H4 increased firstly and then decreased when the metal dosage was 16 and 24 mM. Therefore, H• may be involved during the TCE reduction, leading to the hydrogenation of C2H4 to form C2H6 (Eq. (1)). Furthermore, pure C2H4 gas was injected into the reaction vials to verify the hydrogenation of C2H4. As shown in supplementary Fig. S7, C2H4 was continuously converted to C2H6, confirming the generation of H• by Ni-Fe hydroxides at neutral pH. (1) C2H4 + 2H• → C2H6 The H• can be produced via the catalytic reduction of H +, whose concentration is greatly influenced by the pH value. Therefore, the effect of pH on TCE reduction by Ni-Fe hydroxides was investigated. TCE removal efficiency decreased significantly under acidic condition (supplementary Fig. S8), because acidic environment inhibits the formation of metal hydroxides. Thus, the transformation from free metal cations to metal hydroxides precipitates is vital for the electron transfer from Fe2+ to H + and the subsequent H• generation. Under the neutral and alkaline condition, TCE removal efficiency decreased with increasing pH value (Fig. 3 a). Also, the generation of complete dechlorination products including C2H4 and C2H6 was inhibited at alkaline conditions (Fig. 3c-d). The highest concentration of DCE during TCE reduction increased from pH 7.0 to pH 9.5 due to the accumulation of DCE intermediate, which resulted from the weakened dechlorination activity at alkaline conditions (Fig. 3b). When the pH value increased from 9.5 to 11.5, the reduction of TCE to DCE was inhibited significantly. Although the dominant OH– accelerate the formation of Ni-Fe hydroxides, H• generated from the reduction of H + may play a more critical role in the hydrodechlorination process of TCE. H + obtained electron to form H• according to Eq. (2). As an electron carrier, H• transfer electrons from Fe2+ to TCE for hydrodechlorination. (2) H + + e – → H• It should be noted that the pH value did not change before and after reaction. It is hypothesized that H + is reduced to H•/H2 and OH– could coordinate with the produced Fe3+ to form Fe(OH)3 as shown by the XRD data (Fig. 1d). As a result, the pH is relatively constant along the reaction course."
9,Identification of H•,"3.3 Identification of H• Methanol and TBA can effectively react with H• to form H2 which were widely used as a H• quencher Eqs. (3)–(4) (Chuang et al., 1999; Ran et al., 2019). As shown in supplementary Fig. S9, the dechlorination of TCE was inhibited significantly in the presence of 600 mM TBA and methanol. The carbon balance is ∼100% along the reaction course indicating the solvent effect may have little influence on the reaction. Since C2H4 and C2H6 are the dechlorination products and H• is the only possible reductant that can reduce C2H4 to C2H6 in the system, the C2H4-to-C2H6 conversion was used as a probe reaction to further confirm the H• quenching effect by methanol. Supplementary Fig. S10 shows the C2H4-to-C2H6 conversion was greatly inhibited in the presence of 600 mM methanol, and the conversion efficiency from C2H4 to C2H6 decreased 49.9% after 110 min of reaction. Thus, the inhibited TCE reduction in the presence of methanol is due to the quenching effect of methanol rather than the solvent effect. Due to the stronger H• quenching effect of methanol than that of TBA, methanol with various concentrations was added into the reaction system to study the role of H•. TCE removal efficiency decreased gradually with the increase of methanol concentration (Fig. 4 a), which demonstrated the scavenging of H• by methanol. In addition, the production of C2H4 and C2H6 was also greatly inhibited by methanol demonstrating that H• contribute to the hydrodechlorination of TCE (Fig. 4b). The concentration of DCE increased with the increase of methanol concentration, proving that the insufficient amount of H• results in the accumulation of incomplete dechlorination products. Therefore, H• contribute to the hydrodechlorination of TCE. (3) CH3OH + H• → H2 + CH3OH• (4) C4H10O + H• → H2 + C4H9O• Electrochemical analysis was conducted to further identify the H• species (Jiang et al., 2017). Cyclic voltammogram (CV) showed a prominent peak at −0.40 to −0.20 V (Fig. 5 a, Text S5) corresponding to the oxidation peak of absorbed H• (Bastide et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2016). The oxidation peak of absorbed H• disappeared once TCE was added (Fig. 5b), demonstrating absorbed H• can react with TCE. Also, H2 was detected during the coprecipitation of Ni2+ and Fe2+ at neutral pH (supplementary Fig. S11), which can be attributed to the combination of H• (Eq. (5)). Thus, the precipitated Ni-Fe hydroxides can donate electrons to H +in an aqueous solution, which lead to the generation of H• to hydrodechlorinate TCE. (5) H• + H• → H2"
10,Mechanism of H• generation,"3.4 Mechanism of H• generation Fe2+ acts as an electron donor for TCE reduction, and the role of Ni2+ for TCE hydrodechlorination needs further investigation. Thus, TCE dechlorination by Ni-Fe hydroxides at neutral pH with different Ni2+dosages and a fixed Fe2+ dosage (2 mM) was investigated (supplementary Fig. S12). Ni-Fe LDH and Fe(OH)3 was formed as the oxidation products of Ni-Fe hydroxides after reaction (supplementary Fig. S13). The intensity of the XRD peaks for Ni-Fe LDH increased with Ni/Fe ratio due to the increased Ni dosage, but that for Fe(OH)3 remains constant since the Fe dosage is constant (supplementary Fig. S13). XPS spectra show the presence of Ni2+ (supplementary Fig. S14) and the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ after reaction (supplementary Fig. S15). Thus, Ni2+ act as a catalyst rather than an electron donor during TCE reduction. Hydrodechlorination of one carbon-chlorine bond needs two electrons (Ai et al., 2019). Thus, effective electrons for H•-involved TCE hydrodechlorination was calculated based on the amount of hydrodechlorination intermediates and products. The generation of DCE needs two electrons, and the formation of ethylene need six electrons. The presence of ethane was attributed to the hydrogenation of ethylene, the formation of which from TCE reduction need eight electrons. Thus, the effective electrons can be calculated according to Eq. (6): (6) e E = 2 × C ( DCE ) + 6 × C ( ethylene ) + 8 × C ( ethane ) C represents the concentration, eE represents effective electrons. The calculated eE value increased with time, demonstrating the continuous hydrodechlorination of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides (Fig. 6 a). The utilized electrons (eU ) are designated as the fraction of Fe2+ consumed after the reaction (supplementary Fig. S16). Thus, the electron selectivity (ES) can be calculated according to eE and eU values (Eq. (7)), which is used to assess the efficiency of consumed electrons for TCE hydrodechlorination. (7) E S ( % ) = e E / e U As shown in Fig. 6b, dechlorination by Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4 showed an extremely low ES. The ES value increased greatly with the Ni/Fe ratio increased from 0.4 to 2.0. In the initial reaction stage, ES with the Ni/Fe ratio of 2.0 was high which quickly decreased with time. For the Ni/Fe ratio of 3.0 and 4.0, ES was relatively low initially but increased with time. Notably, the number of utilized electrons with different Ni/Fe ratios are close (supplementary Fig. S16). Thus, the difference in ES value is most likely attributed to the different active species resulted from various Ni/Fe ratios. CVs of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4 showed a prominent peak at −0.20 to 0 V corresponding to the oxidation of adsorbed H• (Fig. 7 a) (Bastide et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2016). The intensity of adsorbed H• peak was higher than absorbed H• peak indicating adsorbed H• was dominant during the structure evolution of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4 in water. Although the adsorbed H• may be more active for hydrodechlorination reaction (Jiang et al., 2017), the adsorbed H• are readily combined to form H2. Because the total metal concentration of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4 was low, the average sizes of particles were relatively small compared with the other Ni-Fe hydroxides (supplementary Fig. S17). Although Ni-Fe hydroxides with small particles size tent to collide more frequently, a low dosage contrarily means a low collide frequency. The net effect favored the combination of adsorbed H• to form H2, which is in line with the low ES of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4. Thus, the electron efficiency for TCE reduction was relatively low with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4, which lead to the low ES value. With the Ni/Fe ratio increased from 0.4 to 2.0, the oxidation peak of adsorbed H• was weakened gradually (Fig. 7b–c). Although the production of adsorbed H• decreased, it is speculated that HER was also weakened because the particle size of Ni-Fe hydroxides was increased (supplementary Fig. S17). More active adsorbed H• can effectively act on the hydrodechlorination of TCE. Therefore, the ES value was high in the initial stage of reaction with the Ni/Fe ratio of 2.0. However, the oxidation of Fe2+ in Ni-Fe hydroxides accelerated the formation of Ni-Fe LDH with a layer structure, thereby reducing the surface area for the generation of adsorbed H•. As shown in supplementary Fig. S18, the arc radius in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Ni-Fe hydroxides increased gradually with aging time, demonstrating that the interfacial electron transfer rate slowed down along with the formation of Ni-Fe LDH (Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, the ES value decreased rapidly over time with the Ni/Fe ratio of 2.0. As shown in Figs. 5a and 7d, only absorbed H• oxidation peak was detected with the Ni/Fe ratios of 3.0 and 4.0. For the Ni/Fe ratio of 3.0, the Nyquist plot diameters of the Ni-Fe hydroxides formed at 5 min, 30 min and 80 min were similar, demonstrating the interfacial electron transfer rate remained relatively constant (supplementary Fig. S19). The formation of LDH structure leads to a decreased amount of active surface for the generation of adsorbed H•. However, the absorbed H• in Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 3.0 was more efficient for TCE dechlorination in the late stage of the reaction comparing with that with the Ni/Fe ratio of 2.0. In order to fully reveal the atomic-scale mechanism for the H• generation on the Ni-Fe hydroxides’ surface, theoretical calculations were performed via DFT. The conformations of Ni-Fe hydroxides with Ni/Fe ratios of 1/3, 2/2 and 3/1 (each unit cell contains four metal atoms) were optimized (supplementary Fig. S20). When the Ni/Fe ratio was 1/3, the length of Fe-O bonds (∼2.1 Å) and Ni-O bonds (∼2.4 Å) were similar. When the Ni/Fe ratio was 2/2, a part of Fe-O bonds were stretched to ∼3.1 Å and a part of Fe-O bonds were compressed to ∼1.8 Å while the length of Ni-O bonds was ∼2.1 Å. When the Ni/Fe ratio was 3/1, the Fe-O bonds (∼2.0 Å) and Ni-O bonds (∼2.4 Å) were evenly distributed. Subsequently, one H atom was added to the optimized configurations of Ni-Fe hydroxides followed by re-optimization. As shown in Fig. 8 , the conformation of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 3/1 was relatively stable after adding H atom comparing with Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratios of 1/3 and 2/2. The added H atom was located nearby Ni atoms with a distance of ∼1.5 Å when the Ni/Fe ratio were 1/3 and 2/2. Interestingly, when the Ni/Fe ratio was 3/1, the added H atom combined with the O atom of Fe-O bond to form a new HO bond. According to previous publications, the absorbed H• located in the crystal lattice was inert for hydrodechlorination (Jiang et al., 2017). However, the added H atom in Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 3/1 was further away from the central metal atoms because the charge between Ni2+ and Fe2+ was redistributed. The electrons were transferred from Fe2+ to the HO bond and form absorbed H•. Subsequently, the absorbed H• continuously contribute to the hydrodechlorination of TCE along with the formation of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 3/1. When the Ni/Fe ratio reaches 4.0, the excessive Ni atoms may disperse the electrons of Fe atoms, inhibiting the electron transfer from Fe2+ to the HO bond. Thus, the ES of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 4/1 was lower than that of 3/1. Fig. 9 a summarized the structure evolution of Ni2+ and Fe2+ cation at neutral aqueous solution during the hydrodechlorination process. Dissolved Fe2+ and Ni2+ cations cannot lead to the generation of H• because the free cations cannot transfer electrons to H +. At neutral or alkaline conditions, Ni(OH)2 and Fe(OH)2 molecule is formed due to the effect of hydroxylation in aqueous solution (Christiansen et al., 2009; Jolivet et al., 2004). The relatively weak reduction potentials of Ni(OH)2 and Fe(OH)2 did not result in any dechlorination process of TCE. Then, Ni(OH)2 and Fe(OH)2 combine to form Ni-Fe hydroxides via olation. During the olation process, the electron could jump from Fe2+ to Ni2+ within the Ni-Fe hydroxides due to galvanic effect, which activate Ni-Fe hydroxides for the catalytic reduction of H + to form H•. Because Ni-Fe hydroxides with various Ni/Fe ratios have different intrinsic properties, the types of catalytically formed H• are different. For the low Ni/Fe ratios of 0.4 and 1, adsorbed H• on the surface of Ni-Fe hydroxides is dominant which enhances HER while inhibiting the hydrodechlorination process. With the Ni/Fe ratio increase to 2.0, the relatively weakened adsorbed H• favor the TCE dechlorination process. When a part of Fe2+ is transformed to Fe3+after reductive hydrodechlorination, the Ni-Fe hydroxides layer become positive. Thus, charge compensating anions were inserted between the Ni-Fe hydroxides layers forming Ni-Fe LDH. The formation of LDH reduces the surface area for the generation of adsorbed H•, which is unfavorable for the hydrodechlorination of TCE. When the Ni/Fe ratio is lower than 2.0, the generated absorbed H• is inert for hydrodechlorination. In contrast, absorbed H• is activated in Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 3.0 due to the unique conformation of H• on Ni-Fe hydroxides (Fig. 9b). Although the amount of adsorbed H• is relatively small in Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 3.0, absorbed H• results in a highly efficient hydrodechlorination of TCE."
11,Application,"3.5 Application The secondary Ni pollution could be of great concern in future application. Thus, the concentration of the dissolved Ni after reaction was determined. After TCE reduction, a fraction of Ni (10.65 ± 0.01 mg L–1) and Fe (5.10 ± 0.10 mg L–1) were released into the reaction solution due to the possible dissolution of Ni-Fe hydroxides. Although relatively high concentration was observed in the studied experimental conditions, the concentration of the dissolved Ni was only 1.5% of the total Ni dosage. Nevertheless, low Ni dosage is recommended in practical application to avoid secondary Ni pollution, which could lead to a longer remediation time than that reported in this work. Dioxygen may be introduced into the subsurface environment due to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. As a common environmental oxidant, dissolved oxygen may exert great influence on the reductive dechlorination of TCE by Ni-Fe hydroxides. When ultrapure water with 10.53 mg L–1 of dissolved oxygen was used, the TCE removal efficiency reached 97.5% and the C2H4 generation reached 47.3% after 200 min of reaction (supplementary Fig. S21a). Although the presence of dissolved oxygen inhibited the TCE reduction due to the scavenger of H•, the remaining H• can still completely dechlorinate TCE after 200 min of reaction. To further evaluate the applicability of Ni-Fe hydroxides in groundwater remediation, the dechlorination reaction was carried out in real groundwater. The parameters of the real groundwater were listed in supplementary Table S3. As shown in supplementary Fig. S21b, 55.5% of TCE was dechlorinated by Ni-Fe hydroxides in the real groundwater matrix. The presence of NO3 – in real groundwater can react with H• to form NH4 + (Chen et al., 2020), which may inhibits the TCE reduction by Ni-Fe hydroxides. The oxygenation of groundwater further inhibits the TCE reduction (supplementary Fig. S21c). Still, 26.3% of TCE was dechlorinated demonstrating the high selectivity of the produced H• towards TCE reduction in the presence of environmental oxidants (i.e., dissolved oxygen and NO3 –). Nevertheless, the absence of environmental oxidants is strongly desired since their presence significantly inhibit the TCE reduction by Ni-Fe hydroxides. Lower concentrations of Ni and Fe ions were observed in the groundwater than ultrapure water, which could be attributed to the sorption of metal cations by dissolved organic matters that exist in the groundwater (supplementary Table S4)."
12,Conclusions,"In this work, we found that H• can be efficiently generated during the transformation of Ni2+ and Fe2+ to Ni-Fe hydroxides in water at neutral pH. The as-formed H• contribute to the hydrodechlorination of TCE in aqueous solution. Nontoxic ethane and ethylene were the dechlorination products due to the high reductive activity of H•. For Ni-Fe hydroxides with the Ni/Fe ratio of 0.4, the presence of dominant adsorbed H• enhances HER causing a low efficiency for hydrodechlorination. When the Ni/Fe ratio was 2.0, the weakly adsorbed H• results in efficient hydrodechlorination of TCE in the initial stage of reaction. Notably, the active absorbed H• is generated in the crystal lattice of Ni-Fe hydroxides with the 3.0 Ni/Fe ratio causing continuous and efficient hydrodechlorination of TCE. Fe2+ and Ni2+ may exist together in anoxic subsurface environment. Thus, Ni-Fe hydroxides can be formed in some area of groundwater under neutral and alkaline condition. This work provides new evidence for the fate and transformation of TCE in subsurface environment. Also, injection of Fe2+ and Ni2+ into polluted plume could be a promising strategy for the remediation of TCE-contaminated groundwater."
