0,Introduction,"Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has a 10.8 wt% theoretical hydrogen storage capacity and is accepted as a solid-state medium for hydrogen storage in view of portable applications [1]. H2 can be produced from NaBH4 by two methodologies: hydrolysis (Eq. (1)) and alcoholysis (Eq. (2)) reactions in the presence of a suitable catalyst, as per the following equations [2,3]: (1) NaBH 4 + 4 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + NaB OH 4 (2) NaBH 4 + CH 3 OH → 4 H 2 + NaB OCH 3 4 Alcohols are a good alternative to water and show some advantages at low temperatures, even for subzero applications. Due to their low freezing points. Under optimum reaction conditions, a faster hydrogen generation rate is achieved in the presence of a proper catalyst. In addition to this, the by-product with the structure of NaB(OR)4, formed after the hydrogen release, does not block the reactor or the equipment, which results in an easy operation [4–6]. Recently the use of methanol, ethanol and glycol for hydrogen production have been investigated with the bath regime and methanolysis reaction mechanisms are reported [7,8]. Methanol and ethanol are preferred instead of other bulky alcohols due to their higher activity [6,9,10]. Several heterogeneous catalysts, including noble and non-noble metals, are widely used for hydrogen generation and their activity was tested with a batch type regime. Among them, Co catalysts are of great interest because other high-cost systems prevent commercialization and easy accessibility [11].Co-based catalysts in the form of salts, metallic nanoparticles, borides, alloys and composites are the most reported for hydrogen evaluation from sodium borohydride (NaBH4, SBH) because of their high activity by providing many active sites for reactions due to the electronic state at the surface [12,13]. The results indicate that cobalt shows high catalytic performances, higher than those of Ru catalysts for the methanolysis of NaBH4 [14]. The methanolysis reaction can be effectively accelerated using a Co/Al2O3 catalyst at a temperature of 0 °C. Thus it can be used for low environmental temperature applications. The results also indicate that methanol can be easily recovered after the methanolysis reaction [15]. Activities of supported Ni2P catalysts, synthesized by different methods, for NaBH4 methanolysis were investigated and the Ni2P-TOP catalyst shows a unique high activity. This is explained by the easier transfer of H species from the nickel sites to the support and fewer Lewis acid sites on the catalyst [16]. SO4 2−/MxOy (M = Cu, Co, Fe) catalysts were prepared and activity tests were applied for hydrogen production from the methanolysis of NaBH4. The results indicated that SO4 2−/CuO exhibits a higher catalytic activity and the order was found as SO4 2−/CuO > SO4 2−/CoO > SO4 2−/Fe2O3 [17]. Researchers have been also focused on investigating the loss of activity over consecutive cycles [18]. The semi-continuous regime was first carried out for continuous and stable H2 production. The feasibility of hydrogen production was explored for the semi-continuous processes of NaBH4 methanolytic dehydrogenation catalyzed with cobalt oxide and cobalt borate catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Co-O and Co-O-B particles for use as catalysts for hydrogen production were synthesized by a conventional sol–gel procedure, as detailed in the literature [19]. The nitrate salt of cobalt (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Merck), citric acid (C6H8O7, Carlo Erba) and boric acid (H3BO3, ETI Maden) were used as the metal precursor, oligomer and boron source, respectively. For the preparation of the Co-O catalyst, an aqueous C6H8O7 solution (0.25 M) was prepared at 80 °C and then the cobalt nitrate salt (0.5 M) was added and the mixture was heated until a gel was obtained. The resulting gel was dried overnight at 110 °C under vacuum to eliminate the remaining water molecules and then it was subjected to a calcination procedure at 450 °C for 4 h under an O2 atmosphere to remove organic components. For the preparation of the Co-O-B catalyst, the same procedure was followed. A sol–gel solution was prepared by dissolving H3BO3 (7.42 g) in 200 ml distilled water and mixing it with an aqueous solution of C6H8O7 including the cobalt nitrate salt (0.5 M). The prepared catalysts were structurally characterized using XRD, N2 Sorption, ICP-OES, SEM/EDS, TEM and XPS techniques. The crystal phases, morphologies, elemental content and surface properties of the catalysts were investigated using XRD (Philips Panalytical X’Pert-Pro). Phase identification of the catalysts was performed using the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD). Pattern matching was performed using the database available, proposed by the PANalytical X'Pert HighScore Plus (PDF‐42018 RDB) software), SEM (ZEISS EVO LS10), N2 sorption (Micrometerics Co, USA) and XPS (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, using an Aluminum anode, Al Kα = 1468.3 eV). The binding energy scale was calibrated by assigning the C 1 s signal at 284.5 eV, TEM (Hitachi HighTech HT7700), SEM/EDS (Zeiss EVO® LS 10) and ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer Optima 2100 DV). In addition to this, Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS, Agilent 7700) techniques were used to analyze the elemental content of the spent solution (Co)."
3,Batch regime for hydrogen production,"2.2 Batch regime for hydrogen production For the batch regime experiments, the hydrogen production was performed based on methanolysis dehydrogenation of NaBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) according to Eq.3. (3) NaBH 4 + 4 CH 3 OH → catalyst NaB OCH 3 4 + 4 H 2 The batch regime methanolysis (10 ml CH3OH, Analytical Grade, Sigma-Aldrich) experiments were carried out in the presence of a catalyst (5 mg) with a 0.12 M initial NaBH4 concentration. Two reactors were operated in parallel under identical conditions: one was fed with the Co-O catalyst and the other with the Co-O-B catalyst. A double-walled semi-batch type reactor equipped with a regulated water bath for maintaining the desired temperature was used. Mixing was done by magnetic stirring (1000 rpm). The generated hydrogen volume (GHV, ml) was measured against time using a water displacement method. H2 evaluation curves were plotted for calculating the hydrogen generation rate (HGR) Besides this, batch regime experiments were conducted at different temperatures of 20, 30 and 40 °C for calculating the activation energy (Ea, kJ/mol) using the Arrhenius equitation."
4,Semi-continuous regime for hydrogen production,"2.3 Semi-continuous regime for hydrogen production The semi-continuous regime experiments were performed under the same conditions as the batch regime at 40 °C temperature. Production was started after loading NaBH4 into the reactor included methanol and the catalyst. The hydrogen volume was noted against time; when the NaBH4 was degraded, a new dosage of NaBH4 was fed into the reactor to continue the production. For the semi-continuous regime, 20 doses were carried out and the total H2 production time reached about 3 h. According to the batch regime observation, it was recorded that NaBH4 was degraded to hydrogen; ~60 ml gas volume was collected in the storage burette for a single set. A new dose of NaBH4 was fed into the reactor when the NaBH4 was degraded in the current set."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The structural properties of the catalysts were characterized using a wide range of techniques: (i) XRD: Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Co-O and Co-O-B particles. The pattern of Co-O comprises peaks from cubic cobalt oxide (Co3O4, JCPDS no: 03-065-310). In addition to this, cobalt borate (BCo3O5, JCPDS no: 01-085-1715 and B2CoO4, 00-018-0887) phases were detected in the Co-O-B particles. XRD analyses proved the successful loading of boron into the Co-O phase [19–21]. The size of the crystalline Co3O4 nanoparticles was calculated from the Scherrer equation and was found to be 14.10 ± 0.71 nm. The Scherrer equation indicated that the crystalline sizes of the BCo3O5 and B2CoO4 particles were 13.23 ± 0.24 and 19.91 ± 7.56 nm in the Co-O-B coded catalyst. As noted by the TEM images in Fig. 2 , however, the Co-O catalyst shows significant particle overlapping, which causes an overestimation of the particle size due to particle aggregation, resulting from the drying of the suspensions on the TEM grid under vacuum [22]. (ii) TEM: Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of the Co-O and Co-O-B particles. By TEM, was shown that the Co-O and Co-O-B catalysts have different morphologies and different particles sizes. The particle size determination was done based on the direct observation of the particles by TEM photographs at randomly selected regions for each sample. It was estimated that the particle size of the Co-O-B homogenous particles was nanoscale with a grain size less than 15 nm. Furthermore, it was seen that the nanoscale Co-O particles had a broad size distribution, with nearly uniform particle sizes of about 15–50 nm. The Co-O-B nanoparticles were smaller than those in the Co-O sample. (iii) N2 sorption: Fig. 3 shows the adsorption and desorption isotherms of the catalysts with their related data. Although the surface areas are closed, the pore sizes are different from each other. The pore diameter of the Co-O-B particle was calculated as 6.65 nm using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of the Co-O and Co-O-B catalysts were fitted with the Type IV-H3 and Type VH1 isotherms, respectively, according to the UIPAC classification related to the mesoporous characteristics. The H1 hysteresis loop implies that the Co-O-B catalyst consists of cylindrical mesoporous pore channels available for filling and emptying [23]. (iv) XPS: Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Co-O and Co-O-B particles. The XPS measurements were carried out to determine the surface properties. The XPS analysis showed that all the elements of the Co-based catalysts were in the oxide states. From the XPS spectrum of the Co-O catalyst, BE 783.0 eV for Co 2p3/2 with cobalt oxide (Co3O4 or Co2O3) on the surface was observed. Also, BE 532.0 eV of O 1s related to oxygen on the surface means that the metals atoms are bonded with oxygen on the surface [24,25]. The XPS results indicated that the surface composition of the fresh Co-O catalyst was 75.16 at.% (O) and 24.83 at.% (Co), leading to a Co/O atomic ratio of 0.33. The BE values of 191.0, 531.0 and 780.0 eV in the XPS spectrum of the Co-O-B catalyst are attributed to B 1s, O 1s and Co 2p3/2 on the surface, respectively. The 780.0 eV value proves the Co0 oxidation state of the nanoparticles, such as CoO, Co2O3, and Co3O4. BE for B 1s were measured in different ranges by several researchers and the results suggested the presence of BO− 2 or B2O3. For the corresponding Co-O-B catalyst, 191.0 eV may be assigned to B2O3 [25].In addition to this, 62.15 at % (O), 21.53 at.% (Co) and 16.30 at.% (B) lead to an Co/B atomic ratio of 1.3 and Co/O of 0.3 for the fresh Co-O-B catalyst surface. (v) ICP-OES: The content of the catalyst was determined by the ICP-OES technique as 85.1% ± 4.6 Co in Co-O and 71.5% ± 3.9 Co and 23.2% ± 0.7B in Co-O-B particles."
7,Batch process regime for hydrogen production,"3.2 Batch process regime for hydrogen production Fig. 5 shows the self methanolysis of NaBH4 at 20, 30 and 40 °C, measured under the same conditions as the in bath and semi-continuous methods without any catalyst. Hydrogen was generated with 0.8, 1.6 and 2.4 ml/min rates at 20, 30 and 40 °C temperature, respectively. A decline in the volume of produced hydrogen was also detected. Fig. 6 shows the batch process regime profiles of methanolytic dehydrogenation of NaBH4. The hydrogen generation with the catalysts as a function of the time at 20, 30 and 40 °C is indicated in Fig. 6a and b. A 60 ml hydrogen gas volume was collected in 29.75, 16.63 and 6.45 min at 20, 30 and 40 °C, respectively. When Co-O-B was used instead of the Co-O catalyst, it was seen that the reaction time at 40 °C was decreased to 6.11 min. The catalytic performance of Co-O-B is higher than that of Co-O for the batch process regime. At 20 °C, the reaction was completed in 30 min for Co-O and the Co-O-B catalyzed reaction is 25% faster. Moreover, the time required for finalizing the H2 production is decreased with an increase in temperature for both catalysts. As can be seen from both profiles, the temperature has a significant effect on the hydrogen generation. On increasing the reaction temperature from 20 °C, 30 ml H2 generation (for 50% NaBH4 conversion) were completed within 4.77 (30 °C), and 2.21 (40 °C) min for the Co-O catalyzed reaction. Thus the temperature rise of the reaction medium has led to an increased H2 generation rate and a reduced reaction time (Fig. 6c). Considering these results, faster hydrogen generation was achieved at 40 °C temperature for both catalysts. The HGR changed from 0.76 to 2.57 ml H2/min mg cat in the Co-O-B catalyzed methanolysis of NaBH4 by rising the temperature from 20 to 40 °C. As can be seen, the H2 production activity of the Co-O-B particles was higher than for Co-O, even at lower temperatures. For screening of the temperature effect on the reaction rate and to calculate the activation energy, additional hydrogen generation experiments were performed at different temperatures while keeping the other conditions the same. The kinetics of the methanolysis reaction of NaBH4 catalyzed by a Co-based catalyst was investigated using the power law kinetic approach. Firstly, the volume of hydrogen generated by the methanolysis reaction at various temperatures (20, 30 and 40 °C) and was converted into a concentration and plotted against time. The order of the methanolysis reactions for both catalysts was calculated as zero by using an integrated method. Based on the zero kinetic model assumption, the methanolysis reactions catalyzed with the corresponding catalysts were taking place on a catalytic surface and the NaBH4 concentration does not have an impact. Moreover, Arrhenius plots (see Fig. 6d) were used to determine the Ea value. The Ea values were found to be 44.47 and 56.79 kJ/mol for the Co-O-B and Co-O catalyzed reactions. It is seen that the Co-O-B catalyst provides a better catalytic activity in terms of the Ea value as compared with Co-O. The Ea values for H2 generation by methanolysis dehydrogenation are comparable with the reported results in the literature: 51.00 kJmol−1 for Ru/Al2O3 [26], 21.9 kJmol−1 for Co/Al2O3 [15] and 36 kJmol−1 for RA-TiO2 −PEI+ [27]."
8,Semi-continuous regime for hydrogen production,"3.3 Semi-continuous regime for hydrogen production Semi-continuous reactors were operated as follows: for the first operation, powder NaBH4 was loaded into the reactor containing methanol and the Co-O/Co-O-B catalysts to start the H2 generation. The dosage time of the semi-continuous method was determined from the batch regime observation. It was found that a 60 ml volume of H2 was produced when NaBH4 was dehydrogenated and a second feeding was made after the H2 volume reached 60 ml. Fig. 7 shows the semi-continuous regime profiles for hydrogen production catalyzed with the Co-O and Co-O-B catalysts. The reactor was dosed 20 times to operate the semi-continuous H2 production and this was completed in 2.5 h (Co-O) and 2.6 h (Co-O-B). At the end of the 20 consequent sets, the total hydrogen volume reached to 1.26 ± 0.01 L, which was equal to 20 batch regime experiments (Fig. 6a). The hydrogen generation rates were calculated at the beginning, during and the end of the experiments (Fig. 6b). For Co-O and Co-O-B, the H2 production rates at the beginning were 0.92 and 0.94 L h−1, and these increased over 24 min to reach 0.50 and 0.46 L h−1. The H2 generation rates reached a relatively steady state within approximately 25 min and this steady stage was continued to the end of the reaction. Lastly, the ICP-MS technique was used to analyze the Co element present in the spent fuel obtained after the semi-continuous production from the two reactors containing the different catalysts. No trace of Co was found in the exhaust solution (<% 0.001), showing that leaching of cobalt from both catalysts into the exhaust solution was not observed under our reaction conditions."
9,The figure-of-merit (FOM),"3.4 The figure-of-merit (FOM) The selection of active catalysts for hydrogen production is very important in the context of the cost and sustainability of the process. A figure-of-merit (FOM) used to evaluate the efficiency of the catalysts. In this study, it takes into account five metrics: (i) hydrogen generation rate (H, ml H2/min mg cat), (ii) specific surface area (S, m2 g−1), (iii) pore volume (V, cm3 g−1), (iv) pore size (S, nm) and reusability (R, expressed in cycles). The parameters were numbered from 1 (low) to 2 (high) according to their values for each catalyst and the factor of merit shows the efficiency order of the catalyst. The results of the FOM analysis are presented in Table 1 - It stands out that the Co-O-B nanoparticles are an effective catalyst for the methanolytic dehydrogenation of NaBH4, with a higher factor. It is thus recommended to use Co-O-B as a catalyst for continuous hydrogen production, without any activity decrease."
10,Conclusions,"In the present work, the semi-continuous regime for continuous and stable hydrogen production catalyzed with Co-O and Co-O-B catalysts was examined. From the figure-of-merit (FOM) analysis, it was found that cobalt borate was more active compared with the cobalt oxide catalyst. This work reports the first semi-continuous hydrogen production by methanolytic dehydrogenation. The results conclude that the semi-continuous method provides H2 production with stable rates for up to ~3 h without any catalyst deactivation. In further studies, based on semi-continue production results, it is focused on design of hydrogen production system operated at continuous regime by automatically feeding of NaBH4 to reactor."
