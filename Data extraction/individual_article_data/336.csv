0,Introduction,"Energy is the driving force of productivity in modern society. However, humanity's excessive consumption on energy from fossil fuels has aggravated global warming, leading the United Nations to promote the Sustainable Development Goals and encourage the use of clean energy by 2030 [1]. Hydrogen, as an efficient and clean secondary energy source, is expected to eventually replace fossil fuels. At present, the use of biomass to produce hydrogen is seen as one of the promising technologies which can effectively solve the problems of high energy costs and environmental pollution. At the same time, as a rich source of biomass, the effective utilization of sludge from urban sewage treatment plants has always been a key focus of the energy industry. Sludge as a by-product, with the increase disposal rate of wastewater, its output is rising [2]. At present, traditional means of sludge disposal [3] include land use, sanitary landfills, composting, utilization as building materials and drying or incineration [4–6]. However, the large amounts of organic pollutants [7], pathogenic bacteria [8] and heavy metals [9] present in sludge, can cause pollution of the soil, air and groundwater, thereby limiting its practical applications and long-term development [10–12]. On the other hand, sludge also contains a lot of nutrients and combustible organic components. The decomposition of organic matter can store energy for recycling [13], which has a high utilization value. At present, using sludge for biomass gasification can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% [14] compared to incineration; hence, sludge gasification is considered as a potential clean energy conversion technology. Sludge gasification mainly decomposes sludge through pyrolysis, oxidation and reduction reactions to obtain syngas rich in H2, CO, CH4 and other CxHy. Gasification technology can be used to rapidly treat sludge. Following gasification, the volume of sludge is reduced, harmful components and toxic pollutants are eliminated [15], and the obtained syngas can be used as an alternative to natural gas [16]. The syngas obtained from sludge gasification not only can be recycled, but also avoid secondary pollution [17]. The focus of sludge gasification research is to optimize process parameters and catalyst ratio, further improve gas production quality and obtain hydrogen rich gas. In the gasification research, catalysts are often used to improve the performance of reforming reactions [18]. The many kinds of catalysts used for tar removal in biomass gasification include alkali catalysts (NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3 and K2CO3) [19–21], activated carbon catalysts [22], metal catalysts (Rh, La, K) [23–25] and metal oxides catalysts (CaO) [26]. Of these, Ni-based catalysts are widely used in hydrogen production from sludge gasification due to advantages such as low cost, ease of regeneration, strong dehydrogenation ability and high reactivity [27,28]. However, when using metal catalysts, the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke deposition on the catalyst surface is inevitable [29]. Consequently, many researchers have inhibited the carbon deposition reaction by adding coke to increase the concentration of product carbon in the system. Biochar has also been used in the study of catalysts or carbon-supported catalysts due to its catalytic effects and it can be consumed directly in the reaction to reduce the amount of gasification residue. Moreover, a previous study [30] showed that the coke resulting from sludge pyrolysis has a relatively rich specific surface area and high porosity, and also has a catalytic effect on the gasification process, providing a clear motivation for the synthesis of Ni-based sludge coke catalysts. In the catalyst synthesis process, most studies use the impregnation method for mixing the catalyst and biomass to ensure uniform loading [31]. However, the operation of this process is complex and the active components are easy to be lost. Mechanical ball-milling is a technology for preparing ultrafine powders by mechanical energy processing, and fine milling is conducive to accelerating carbon conversion under conditions of diffusion control [32]. Through mechanical ball-milling, the specific surface area of the material can be continuously increased [33], thereby increasing the contact area between the reactant and the carbon powder and reducing the activation energy of the reaction. Studies have shown that increasing the catalyst grinding time increases the rate of generation of hydrogen in the catalytic gasification of sludge [34], thus speeding up the gasification reaction. Therefore, mechanical ball-milling technology may be introduced into the synthesis of Ni-based sludge coke catalyst to effectively improve the quality of gas production. Against this backdrop, the present study proposes a mechanical ball-milling method to prepare a Ni-based supported sludge coke catalyst for sludge steam gasification. For the purposes of improving the quality of syngas, the effects of different factors, such as ball milling time, gasification temperature, steam flow rate and NiO loading rate on the gasification characteristics of the Ni-based sludge coke were investigated. The effects of gas production under different conditions were analyzed and the gas production parameters were optimized to obtain high quality syngas and improve the sludge recycling efficiency."
1,Experimental section,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials The sludge selected for this study was dewatered sludge obtained from the Xi'an No. 4 Sewage Treatment Plant (Shaanxi Province, China), with a moisture content of (78%–80%). After receiving the sample, it was naturally dried, and a small amount was kept aside for industrial and elemental analysis, while the remainder was used as the raw material for the experiments. The properties of the sludge are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Material preparation,"2.2 Material preparation Preparation of sludge coke: using a fixed bed reactor, the dehydrated sludge was placed in a ceramic tank outside the heating zone and heated to 500 °C. Prior to this, the furnace reaction zone was purged with N2 (150 mL min−1, 12 min) to remove air. The ceramic pot was then placed in the heating zone for 1.0 h to pyrolyze, after which it was taken out and left to cool to room temperature (25 °C). Preparation of Ni-based sludge coke catalyst: 3.0 g of sludge coke was mixed with 0.6 g of NiO, then loaded into a planetary ball-mill with the following operating parameters: grinding speed of 425 r·min−1, ball-to-material ratio of 18:1, grinding ball diameter of 6.0 mm and ball-milling time of 10 min [32]. Sludge gasification: 5.0 g of dry sludge (DS) and 1.2 g of Ni-based sludge coke catalyst (The selection basis is shown in Fig. S1.) were evenly mixed, poured into the quartz reaction tank and placed outside the heating zone of the reactor. The furnace temperature of the sludge pyrolysis unit was raised to the final temperature, and N2 (150 mL min−1, 12 min) was purged to the reaction zone of the furnace to remove air. At the same time, the temperature of the steam reactor was raised to 250 °C, and superheated steam was injected into the furnace at a certain flow rate. The quartz tank containing the sample was then pushed to the heating area, and the residence time of the solid-phase reaction, which coincided with the time of steam entry, was 20 min [35]. The tar and remaining steam produced by gasification were removed in the condenser, and the gas was filtered and condensed before being gathered in the collection bag. The quality of the gas-phase component was measured via gas chromatography (GC). The design of process parameters for the gasification of catalytic sludge with Ni-based sludge coke is shown in Table 2 ."
4,Syngas analysis,"2.3 Syngas analysis The evaluation indexes of gasification syngas include gas yield, low calorific value of the unit mass sludge (Q L ), H2 yield, and carbon conversion rate. The formulas used for calculating these indexes are as follows: (1) Gas yield: the volume of gas fuel obtained from gasification of 1 kg of sludge under standard conditions, (1) Y = V m where Y is the gas yield (m3·kg−1), V is the volume of the obtained gas in standard state (m3), m is the mass of the sludge (kg). (2) Q L is the chemical energy contained in unit hydrogen rich body. This index can be calculated by formula, (2) Q L = Y × ( 107.98 ϕ H 2 + 126.36 ϕ C O + 358.18 ϕ C H 4 + 629.09 ϕ C 2 H m ) where Q L is energy of yield (KJ·kg−1), and ϕ H 2 , ϕ C O , ϕ C H 4 , and ϕ C 2 H m are the volume fractions of H2, CO, CH4 and C2Hm in the gasification gas (%), respectively. (3) H2 yield: the amount of H2 obtained from gasification of unit mass of sludge, (3) Y H 2 = 1000 Y 22.4 × ϕ H 2 (4) Carbon conversion rate: the ratio of carbon mass in gas fuel to that in biomass raw material, (4) X C ( % ) = 12 × （ ϕ CO 2 + ϕ CO + ϕ CH 4 + 2.5 ϕ C 2 H m ） × Y 22.4 × ( 298 273 ) × ϕ C where ϕ C is the percentage of carbon content in the raw material. The following analysis methods were used: (1) Gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., 6890GC) was used to determine the composition of gaseous products. (2) The elemental composition analysis of sludge was conducted using a VarioMacro cube element analyzer. (3) The functional groups of sludge and coke were characterized using Thermal Fisher Nicolet IS-50 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) within the range of 4000-400 cm−1. The resolution was 4 cm−1, and the number of scans were 16 times. (4) The structure of catalysts and coke were analyzed using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The 2θ patterns of diffraction were gathered in the range of 10°–80° with a 8°·min−1 scanning speed."
5,Results and discussion,"The main components of sludge gasification products are H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. Sludge gasification is mainly divided into two stages:(1) pyrolysis stage, in which biomass is decomposed into coke, volatiles and gases; (2) reforming stage, in which under the conditions of steam and catalyst, the volatile/gas reforming to produce gases such as CO and H2. The main reactions are as follows [16]: (R1) CxHyOZ → Char + aCO2 +bCO + cH2 + dCH4 +eCmHn+ …… (R2) CxHy + 2xH2O→ xCO2 + (2x + y/2) H2 (R3) C + H2O → CO + H2 +130 kJ·mol-1 Char steam gasification (R4) C + CO2 → 2CO +170 kJ·mol-1 Boudouard (R5) CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2 +206 kJ·mol-1 Reforming methane (R6) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 −41 kJ·mol-1 Water-gas shift reaction"
6,Influence of process parameters on sludge gasification characteristics,"3.1 Influence of process parameters on sludge gasification characteristics Choosing appropriate values of the sludge gasification temperature and catalyst ball-milling time [36,37] can improve the H2 yield. Therefore, these two parameters were selected for process optimization and their effects on gas production properties and syngas quality were evaluated. 3.1.1 Effect of temperature on sludge steam gasification According to the literature, temperatures above 1000 °C are not suitable for gasification [38]; hence, the effect of Ni-based sludge coke on sludge steam catalytic gasification was investigated in the range of 500°C~900 °C. The results of three-phase yield at different temperatures are shown in Table S1 and TG-DTG curves and analysis are shown in Fig. S2. According to TG-DTG curve, the whole sludge gasification process can be divided into three stages. The results of sludge gasification at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 1 . Compared with 500 °C, the mass fraction of gas phase increased by 23.8 times at 900 °C, and the mass fraction of liquid phase and solid phase decreased with the increase of sludge gasification temperature. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show that when the temperature is higher than 600 °C, the yield of H2 begins to rise, which is consistent with the TG-DTG analysis in Fig. S2. When the temperature is higher than 550 °C, the organic matter with high stability continues to decompose to produce H2, forming a reducing atmosphere, which promotes the reduction of NiO to Ni and makes the gas yield rise continuously. The gas yield and QL increased from 0.02 m3 kg−1 and 144.01 kJ kg−1 at 500 °C to 0.76 m3 kg−1 and 8646.72 kJ kg−1 at 900 °C, i.e., increases of 37 and 59 times, respectively. Simultaneously, the carbon conversion also increased significantly, reaching a maximum value of 64.74% at 900 °C. The results show that temperature has a significant effect on the decomposition of organic matter and the tar cracking of sludge, and the higher the temperature, the greater the efficiency of sludge gasification. The TG curves (Fig. S2) also shows that the higher the temperature, the more thorough the decomposition. Fig. 1(c) shows that as the temperature increased, the indicators of gasification syngas basically showed an upward trend. When the temperature was <500 °C, the organic matter was not fully pyrolyzed and the gas yield was low. As the temperature increased, the gas yield continued to increase and biomass decomposition and volatile reforming reactions (Eq.(R1) (R2)) occurred. At higher temperature, coke gasification was promoted (Eq.(R3) (R4)) to produce light gases such as H2, CO, CO2 and CH4, and the CO volume fraction reached its maximum at 900 °C. The CH4 volume fraction showed a maximum value at 600 °C which was mainly due to the increase of CH4 concentration from (Eq.(R1)). When the gasification temperature reached 700 °C, however, the conditions were beneficial to CH4 consumption (Eq.(R5)), resulting in the decrease of the CH4 volume fraction. The volume fraction of CnHm in the gas also decreased with increasing temperature (Fig. 1(d)) by a factor of 5.9, from 12.64% at 500 °C to 1.83% at 900 °C, as a result of Le Chatelier's principle which states that an increase in temperature is conducive to the reaction balance moving towards the direction of endothermic reaction. At high temperatures, more CnHm macromolecules undergo secondary pyrolysis, and the reaction between gasification products generates H2, CH4 and other small-molecule gases. On the other hand, hydrogen was increased by the presence of steam as the gasifying agent and was also favored by the increase in temperature. At 900 °C, mainly due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction [39] (Eq.(R6)) at high temperature, the volume fraction of H2 decreased slightly compared with that at 800 °C, but the gas yield and the QL both reached maxima at 900 °C. For this reason, the subsequent experiments were carried out at 900 °C. The comparison of hydrogen production and concentration between the catalyst in this study and other catalysts is shown in Table 3 . It can be found that the volume fraction of hydrogen can reach 52.22% under the catalytic action of Ni-based catalyst, which is higher than other experimental results and realizes the purpose of preparing high quality hydrogen rich gas. 3.1.2 Effect of catalyst ball-milling time on steam gasification of catalytic sludge The results of three-phase yield under different milling time are shown in Table S2. The mass fraction of gas phase decreased with the increase of milling time, and the mass fraction of liquid phase reached the lowest value when the milling time was 10 min. As the ball-milling time was increased, the gas production effect showed a maximum at a ball-milling time of 10 min (Fig. 2 (a) and (b)). As the ball-milling time was increased from 5 min to 10 min, the gas yield, H2 yield, and QL all reached their peak values of 0.76 m3 kg−1, 0.34 m3 kg−1 and 8646.7 kJ kg−1, respectively. However, as the ball-milling time was increased further, the subsequent decrease in the gas production index may be due to the NiO having been fully loaded on the surface of the sludge coke. Due to material changes caused by mechanical forces over a long period of time, ultrafine grinding may also lead to structural changes of biochar (The results were confirmed by SEM (Fig. S3) and XRD (Fig. 6(a)) at different milling time). Fig. 2(c) shows that the volume of each component of syngas does not change very much as the ball-milling time increases. The volume fractions of H2, CO and CH4 all increased slightly as the ball-milling time was increased from 5 min to 10 min, and remained stable thereafter. The ratio of H2/CO reached its maximum value at 10 min, and the maximum value of the combustible gas volume fraction was 78.14% at 10 min. Therefore, a ball-milling time of 10 min was used to carry out the subsequent experiments."
7,Effect of material ratio on sludge steam gasification characteristics,"3.2 Effect of material ratio on sludge steam gasification characteristics To determine the optimal process parameters for sludge gasification under Ni-based sludge coke catalysis, the material mixing ratio (NiO loading rate) and steam flow rate were varied, providing a theoretical basis for subsequent experiments. 3.2.1 Effect of Ni-based loading rate on sludge steam gasification The results of three-phase yield under different NiO loading rates are shown in Table S3. With the increase of NiO loading rate, the mass fraction of liquid phase decreases and the mass fraction of gasification gas increases by 9%–27%. Fig. 3 (a) shows that as the NiO loading rate was increased, the gas yield, H2 yield and QL showed maximum values of 0.76 m3 kg−1, 0.34 m3 kg−1 and 8646.7 kJ kg−1, respectively, at NiO loading rate of 20%, representing increases of 15%, 17% and 16%, respectively, compared to the system with no NiO added. Analyzing Fig. 3(b) reveals that the addition of metal oxide NiO leads to in-situ carbon reduction, and that C reacts with NiO to form elemental Ni and CO, while gas reduction also takes place. CO also reacted with NiO to form elemental Ni and CO2, the latter of which is consumed in the Boudouard reaction (Eq.(R4)) to form CO. Therefore, the concentration of CO2 remained basically unchanged, while that of CO showed a slow increase with increased NiO loading. Simultaneously, with the addition of Ni-based catalyst, the volume fraction of CH4 in gasification syngas basically decreased, which is mainly due to the CH4 reforming reaction with steam (Eq.(R5)), where in CH4 and water produced by the decomposition of the organic matter in sludge react to produce CO and H2. Due to the presence of metal oxides, CO and H2 participate in the reduction of NiO, and Eq.(R5) is pushed to the right to promote the consumption and conversion of CH4 and reduce its volume fraction in the syngas. Ni-based sludge coke with different loading rates catalyzed the sludge steam gasification reaction, improving various gas production indexes, and the volume fraction of combustible gas (i.e., the sum of H2, CO, CH4) also reached its highest value of 78.14%. However, when the NiO loading rate exceeded 20%, both the concentration of H2 in syngas and the quality decreased, as the presence of excessive NiO reduces the available surface area and occupies some of the active sites on the semi-coke, and may also block the pore channels, thus affecting the performance of the Ni-based catalyst. BET analysis results confirm this point, as shown in Table S4 and Fig. S4. The results show that the specific surface area, pore size and pore volume decrease with the increase of nickel loading; The decrease of specific surface area caused by the increase of nickel loading is related to the collapse of mesoporous support structure or the partial blockage of nickel clusters [45]. Moreover, the H2/CO ratio reached its highest value of 1.98 when the loading rate was 20% (Table 4 ). Abedi et al. [46] also found that an appropriate amount of Ni loading can have a positive effect and reduce the generation of tar in the gasification of oat shell particles. 3.2.2 Effect of steam flow rate on sludge vaporization The results of three-phase yield under different steam flow rates are shown in Table S5. The mass fraction of gasified gas reaches the maximum when the steam flow rate is 2.0 g min−1, which is 58.3% higher than that at 0.5 g min−1. With the increase of water vapor flow rate, the mass fraction of liquid phase and solid phase decreases. Fig. 4 (a) shows that the introduction of steam has a positive influence on the quality of the product gas, which is basically consistent with the results of Hernandez et al.’s study [47]. It is evident that increasing the steam content led to the conversion of combustibles (CO, H2, CH4, and C2H6). The addition of steam causes CH4 produced by the decomposition of organic matter in sludge to undergo the CH4 reforming reaction with steam (Eq.(R5)). Simultaneously, the C from the sludge coke and the decomposition of the sludge itself were converted into water gas (Eq.(R3)). However, after steam flow rate 1 g min−1, its growth rate gradually became flat, as the reaction was complete. Further, the presence of excess steam causes a large amount of energy to be input to the system. With the increase of steam flow, the H2 volume fraction reached a maximum of 45.14% at 1 g min−1 (Fig. 4(b)), and the H2/CO ratio reached a maximum of 1.98 (Fig. 4(c)), which was 3.5 times the maximum H2/CO ratio seen in the co-gasification of sludge and palm kernel shell [48]. When the flow rate of water vapor exceeds 1 g min−1, more steam and C in the mixture have carbon in situ reduction reaction, the metal oxide catalyzed to reduce the metal element and generate CO at the same time, so that the conversion rate of CO and carbon increased while the tendency of H2 decreased (Fig. 4(b)). Excessive steam may also condense [49], which consumes the heat in the system and leads to a decrease in temperature, thus affecting the quality of gas production. Therefore, considering the gas quality and economy of the process, Water vapor flow rate of 1 g min−1 is the best point for syngas quality. At this flow rate, the volume fraction of H2 in the synthetic gas was the highest, and the H2/CO ratio was close to 2, meaning that this syngas can be used for processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or synthetic alcohol ether fuel [50]."
8,Mechanism analysis of sludge gasification catalyzed by Ni-based sludge coke,"3.3 Mechanism analysis of sludge gasification catalyzed by Ni-based sludge coke 3.3.1 FTIR analysis The FTIR results for Ni-based sludge coke and its catalytic sludge gasification coke at different ball-milling times are shown in Fig. 5 . The absorption peaks at 3315 cm−1, 1595 cm−1 and 1446 cm−1 are attributed to the hydroxyl O–H, aromatic CC stretching vibrations and the aliphatic C–H bending vibration, respectively (Fig. 5(a)). As the ball-milling time was increased, the absorption peaks of each functional group were strengthened, which may be due to the increase in O–H caused by the micro degradation of some organic substances due to the long impact time. The sedimentation of grease substances caused an increase in the aromatic and aliphatic compounds, and both of these caused the loss of sludge coke. Therefore, longer ball-milling times are not conducive to the improvement of gas production. The vibration peak disappeared after gasification (Fig. 5(b)), indicating that the gasification process was relatively complete. The wide stretching vibration peaks (1350~700 cm−1) seen in Fig. 5(a) and (b) centered around 1000 cm−1 may be related to the carbon chain skeleton, aromatic substances and Si in the sludge. With increased ball-milling time, SiO2 in the sludge coke caused stretching of the Si–O bond due to the impact fracture and gasification process [51,52]. This also indicates that long ball-milling times may lead to structural changes in the biochar and the collapse of the SiO2 skeleton, which affects the nickel load and is therefore not conducive to sludge gasification and gas production. The changes in the FTIR spectra of raw sludge and Ni-based sludge coke after catalytic sludge gasification at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 5(c). The –OH stretching vibration absorption peak near 3280 cm−1 and the aliphatic C–H absorption peak near 2910 cm−1 disappear after gasification. The results indicate that at higher temperatures, most of the organic compounds in the sludge, such as aldehyde, keto and carboxylic acid, were decomposed when the gasification temperature reached 900 °C [53], and small molecular gases such as CO and H2 were precipitated in the volatiles through gasification. The absorption peak at 1587 cm−1 was speculated to be caused by the incomplete decomposition of carbonyl groups (CO) in the band 1650 cm−1 and the functional group CC in the band 1530 cm−1 of the raw sludge. However, as the temperature increased, this peak gradually decreased, disappearing completely at 900 °C. In Fig. 5(a), (b) and (c), the aromatic C–H plane bending vibration was observed near 900~650 cm−1 [54,55], which reflects the degree of condensation of aromatic structures to a certain extent. It is speculated that CO2 and H2O in the volatile matter were adsorbed on the surface of the coke, and aliphatic compounds were generated via aromatic ring and CO2 cracking and H2O gasification reactions at high temperature. As the temperature increased, the sludge gasification was more thorough. In general, these results indicate that as the ball-milling time increases to >30 min, aromatic CC and aliphatic C–H functional groups on the Ni-based sludge coke increased, which may be attributed to the precipitation of lipid substances and may cause losses of the sludge coke material. The crystal structure of SiO2 was also destroyed, which was not conducive to the enhancement of sludge gasification. Increasing the temperature promoted the decomposition of organic matter in the sludge through pathways such as deacidification and dehydrogenation, resulting in complete decomposition of the refractory organic matter, which improved the gas production effect. 3.3.2 XRD analysis The XRD patterns for Ni-based coke and gasified char under different ball-milling times are shown in Fig. 6(a) (b). The diffraction peaks of SiO2 are mainly at 21° and 26.5°, while those of NiO are mainly at 37.2°, 43.2° and 62.8°. It can be seen that the XRD diffraction peaks of sludge coke are similar under different milling time. The sharp diffraction peaks and complete crystal morphology of NiO indicate that the Ni-based materials are successfully loaded after mechanical ball milling. However, with the increase of milling time, the diffraction peaks of SiO2 and NiO are relatively stable in the early stage, and almost unchanged. However, with the increase of ball milling time, due to the longer impact time and more times between the ball and the sludge coke, the intensity of diffraction peaks of SiO2 and NiO decreased, and the signs of peak broadening and dispersion were observed, indicating that some crystal structures were destroyed, distorted and the grain size decreased [56]. After catalytic sludge gasification, the XRD patterns of the char mainly consisted of the diffraction peaks of SiO2, NiO, Ni and small peaks of other inorganic compounds (Fig. 6(b)). The high and low diffraction peaks of SiO2 are mainly due to the complexity of the sludge sample composition. In addition, the gasification of sludge produced H2, which created a reducing atmosphere in which NiO was reduced to Ni metal, forming Ni particles which were dispersed evenly throughout the sample and in turn were able to catalyze the production of H2. The results show that the diffraction peak of Ni is sharper and hence its crystalline form was better at 10 min, whereupon the volume fraction of H2 reached 45.14%, and the H2 yield reached 0.34 m3 kg−1. Simultaneously, NiO was reduced to Ni to a greater extent, which promoted sludge decomposition and tar secondary cracking, increased the gas production rate and H2 production rate and improved the quality of gas production. The XRD of the char samples after gasification at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6(c). In the catalytic sludge gasification of NiO-supported sludge coke, NiO loaded on calcined sludge coke was reduced to Ni after high temperature calcination, with no other substances formed (Fig. 6(c)). In the process of gasification, H2 was generated at 450 °C. When the temperature was <500 °C, the conditions were not conducive to the reduction of NiO. As temperature increased, however, the diffraction peak of Ni gradually increased and became sharper, indicating both a better crystalline structure and that all the NiO present was basically reduced to Ni. As the gasification reaction of tar continued, the volume fractions of H2 and CO increased, and the volume fraction of CO reached its maximum value at 800 °C, which may be due to the high reforming activity of Ni at 750 °C [57]. At 900 °C, the impurity peak decreased, and the gasification decomposition of sludge was more thorough, resulting in the gas yield, H2 yield, carbon conversion rate, and calorific value increasing significantly compared to those at 800 °C. Overall, these results indicate that increasing the ball-milling time (in the range of 5~30 min) was conducive to the even dispersion of NiO throughout the biochar, thereby boosting its catalytic performance. However, the loss of biochar material at ball-milling times >30 min was not conducive to gasification. Further, increasing the temperature was conducive to the release of combustible gases such as CO and H2, and to the increase in concentration of reducing gas, which promoted the reduction of almost all the NiO to Ni while simultaneously providing oxygen atoms for gasification, thereby promoting the generation of CO and catalyzing the decomposition of sludge and tar cracking to produce gas."
9,Conclusions,"This study realized the utilization of sludge resources. A new Ni-based sludge coke catalyst was prepared by mechanical ball milling to catalyze sludge gasification, and high-quality hydrogen rich syngas gas was obtained. The highest volume fraction of H2 could reach 52.22% at different temperatures. The gas yield and H2 yield at 900 °C were 38 times and 85 times higher than those at 500 °C. Appropriate ball milling time makes NiO loading effect the best, which is conducive to sludge gasification. When the milling time was 10 min and the loading was 20%, the volume fraction of combustible gas reached the maximum of 78.14%. The introduction of steam also made the H2/CO ratio reach 1.98, which improved the quality of syngas. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of biochar-based catalysts and sludge gasification and provides a more extensive means for solid waste conversion into clean energy."
