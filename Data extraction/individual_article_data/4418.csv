0,Introduction,"The second-generation bio-oil is a promising energy resource which is gaining prominence and importance not only because of its energy potential and renewable properties but also because of its compatibility with food supply, biodiversity and environment [1–4]. This bio-oil is derived from biomass comprising mainly of residual and non-food portions of agricultural produce and the conversion process is usually via a thermochemical route such as pyrolysis which is normally operated at temperatures of 300–600 °C in the absence of oxygen [5]. Liquid bio-oil, combustible gas and solid biochar constitute the main products of pyrolysis [6–8] with bio-oil yield normally accounting for 50–75 wt% dry basis of the feedstock [2,7]. Raw bio-oil, with its high moisture content and hydrophilic properties, requires additional processing to make it compatible with existing engine designs [7,9]. Several technologies are available to improve the properties of bio-oil and make it a viable fuel alternative. One of which is esterification which transforms bio-oil to commercial biodiesel with the aid of a catalyst. Since the properties of the ensuing biodiesel may still fall short of diesel standards, only a small fraction of biodiesel is combined with diesel fuel, a non-polar liquid hydrocarbon, to produce biodiesel-diesel blends. The process of esterification makes the raw bio-oil more miscible with diesel [10]. Other bio-oil upgrading strategies include catalytic cracking, catalytic hydro-deoxidation, and catalytic steam reforming [10]. All of these techniques use materials and substances such as catalysts, strong acids, enzymes, and other additional chemicals that are generally expensive, toxic and detrimental to the environment. These methods, when employed, can become incompatible with bio-oil's selling point as a carbon neutral, renewable and clean energy resource [11]. A simple yet effective and inexpensive way to convert raw bio-oil to a more useful form is by emulsification [1]. Emulsification disperses polar bio-oil in non-polar diesel through the aid of surfactants or emulsifying agents to form a stable and homogeneous emulsion. The main role of the surfactant is to encapsulate and isolate the bio-oil from diesel [12]. Several studies have been conducted on bio-oil dispersions in another liquid (i.e., bio-oil emulsions). For example, Hsieh et al. [13] blended bio-oil and diesel (bio-oil at 40 vol%) by means of a homogenizer (16,700 rpm) for 10 min using two emulsifiers, Tween 80 and Span 80. The resulting emulsion lasted for only 5 days and phase separation took place thereafter. Ghannam and Selim [14] emulsified bio-oil using Triton X-100 emulsifier in a high-speed mixer (15,000 rpm) for 2 min. The ensuing emulsion remained homogenous and stable for 4 weeks. Guo et al. [15] used 10 wt% bio-oil and the resulting emulsion remained stable for only 31 days [15]. The study of Ikura et al. [16], showed bio-oil emulsions with longer stability of 42 days at bio-oil content ranging from 10 to 30 wt%, but the bio-oil feedstock used was an upgraded and centrifuged lighter phase bio-oil instead of crude bio-oil. Another important aspect in bio-oil emulsification studies is the mixing strategy employed. Various mixing apparatus have been used such as ultrasonic emulsifier [17–19], homogenizer [20,21], mechanical mixer [16,22], and vortex mixer [6,13]. The ultrasonic emulsifier provides vibrational and high-speed mixing, but is relatively costly and expensive [15,17,18], whereas the mechanical mixer with a high-speed rotating shaft and impellers gives lower operational cost. The vortex mixer, on the other hand, provides a no-contact mixing where the tube vessel vibrates and creates a vortex in the solution for mixing or emulsification [6]. The mechanical mixer uses radially installed impellers while the homogenizer employs vertically installed impellers that are parallel to the stator. Increasing the bio-oil content in fuel emulsions without sacrificing fuel quality has been a goal for many researchers. Other studies focused their investigation on the determination of the most appropriate emulsifier and increasing its relative amount to accommodate higher amounts of bio-oil in the emulsion. Non-ionic surfactants: Span 80 and Tween 80 have been widely used in bio-oil emulsification studies with varying success and failure in emulsification performance and emulsion stability. Nevertheless, Lin et al. [6] showed that Atlox 4914 exceeded the performance of Span 80 and Tween 80. Atlox 4914 is a non-ionic emulsifying chemical compound consisting of a polar and hydrophilic polyethylene oxide head and a non-polar lyophilic poly 12-hydroxystearic acid (pHSA) or alkyd resin tail [6]. Lin et al. [6] established a correlation between the higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil and the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of emulsifier. HLB value is a good measure of the hydrophilic and lipophilic functional groups present in the emulsifier, and is related to the strength of the polarity and hydrogen bonding properties of the surfactant head and tail. The HLB of Atlox 4914 was around 6.0 and appropriate for water-in-oil (W/O) emulsification. The work of Sherman [23] had shown that when the amount of emulsifier was increased continuously for the purpose of raising bio-oil content or extending the emulsion's shelf-life or stability, emulsion viscosity increased and emulsion stability worsened. Thus, improvement on emulsion bio-oil content or emulsion stability using emulsifiers is limited to an optimal ratio and amount. Alcohols have the capacity to reduce the viscosity of bio-oil emulsions [24], are surface-active compounds that can lower surface tension and therefore can be suitable co-surfactants [25]. Furthermore, the addition of alcohol to diesel can abate the drawbacks of burning diesel fuel such as soot formation as well as CO and NOx emissions, thus making diesel a cleaner fuel [26]. To date, no study has been done which investigated bio-oil in diesel emulsions with bio-oil content higher than 30 wt% that remained stable until 60 days. It is desirable to utilize the energy potential of bio-oil in a much higher capacity, and to take advantage of its clean and renewable energy properties [27]. The present study aims to investigate the effect of alcohols as co-surfactants to accommodate the increasing amounts of pyrolysis bio-oil in diesel on emulsion homogeneity and stability. In addition, an inexpensive, off-the-shelf blender is used for the emulsification of pyrolysis bio-oil in diesel and the results are compared to emulsions that used a vortex mixer."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Bio-oil, diesel, emulsifier and co-surfactants","2.1 Bio-oil, diesel, emulsifier and co-surfactants The bio-oil used in this study was sourced from China Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in Taiwan. The bio-oil was produced from the fast pyrolysis of rubber wood sawdust, which pertain to a lignocellulosic material, in a fluidized bed reactor and an oxygen free environment at a temperature range of 450–550 °C. The diesel fuel used was commercially available and sourced from CPC petrol station. In this work, the diesel fuel made up the bulk of the emulsion system (i.e., the continuous phase) and the bio-oil was dispersed into the diesel. The emulsifier used in the experiments was Atlox 4914 from Croda International Plc. Three different alcohols namely methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol with purity higher than 99 vol% were used as co-surfactants."
3,Minimum emulsifier usage and co-surfactant test,"2.2 Minimum emulsifier usage and co-surfactant test The emulsifier limit was determined by devising several emulsification experiments having 2 g of bio-oil and varying amounts of emulsifier where the weight of the mixture of bio-oil, diesel, and emulsifier was fixed at 20 g. Specifically, several tubes with different bio-oil-to-emulsifier weight ratios (B/E ratios) were prepared where the ratios of 1.0–3.2 (with an increment of 0.2) were taken into account to test the limit. The emulsifier and diesel were first loaded into a centrifuge tube, followed by premixing using a vortex mixer (Digisystem Laboratory Instruments Inc., Model: VM-2000) for 1 min. Thereafter, the bio-oil was dropped into the mixture which was then mixed by the vortex mixer for 2 min. Fig. 1 shows the simple diagram illustrating the emulsification process. Subsequently, the resulting emulsions were observed after 2 h to check if phase separation occurred. The emulsion samples, labeled and arranged in a tube rack, were stored in the laboratory under room temperature condition ranging from 25 to 30 °C. The aforementioned procedure was also performed for the cases of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 g bio-oil content emulsions to determine the limit or minimum emulsifier ratio for each bio-oil conditions. The minimum emulsifier ratios determined in the aforementioned procedure were used in subsequent experiments. The presence of phase separation stood for the failure of emulsification and the instability of emulsion, and an interface or phase boundary would be visible in the tube. On top of this interface was the lighter or top phase (e.g. diesel), whereas below it was the heavier or bottom phase (i.e., bio-oil). In order to quantify the extent of phase separation, a parameter called normalized interface volume (NIV) was defined as shown in Eq. (1). (1) NIV ( v / v ) = Bottom phase volume Total emulsion volume Accordingly, the appearance of the emulsion is uniform if the NIV is unity, and the smaller the NIV value, the greater the extent of phase separation. Once the minimum emulsifier usage was determined, different amounts of co-surfactants via controlling the co-surfactant-to-emulsifier weight ratio (C/E ratio) were added into the emulsions to examine their influence on the stability of the emulsions. In this study, three different amounts of pyrolysis bio-oil (i.e. 5, 6, and 7 g) were tested, and the C/E ratios were between 0.2 and 1.2 with an increment of 0.1. When the co-surfactants were added into the emulsions, the mixtures were mixed using the vortex mixer for 2 min for subsequent observation."
4,Mixing apparatus,"2.3 Mixing apparatus The vortex mixer provided mixing at a vibrating speed of 3000 rpm while an off-the-shelf blender having two mixing speeds of 13,000 rpm and 17,000 rpm was also employed as an alternative mixing method. The performances of the different mixing strategies were compared in terms of mixing mechanism and mixing speed."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The properties of pyrolysis bio-oil, diesel, emulsifier, and co-surfactants such as viscosity, higher heating value (HHV), pH value, and element percent were analyzed. The viscosities and HHVs were measured using an Ostwald viscometer and a bomb calorimeter (IKA C5000), respectively. A pH meter (SUNTEX SP-2300) was used to measure the pH of the bio-oil. The weight percentages of C, H, O, and N in the pyrolysis bio-oil were analyzed by an elemental analyzer (PerkinElmer 2400 Series II) where the weight percentage of O was computed by difference, that is, O (wt%) = 100–C–H–N. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, PerkinElmer Spectrum 100) was used to examine the stability and homogeneity of emulsions through the identification of the functional groups present in these liquid mixtures. FTIR measured the infrared (IR) spectra of emulsions and provided information on the chemical bonds and functional groups present in the samples. The FTIR spectra of three regions in the emulsions were analyzed, namely, the top, middle and bottom liquid levels of the sample emulsion tube [6]. A homogenous emulsion would show overlapping or coinciding FTIR spectra results for the three regions. Whereas, differing FTIR spectra results validate the occurrence of phase separation in the emulsion since in some cases phase separation was not readily perceived from visual observation."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Minimum emulsifier usage,"3.1 Minimum emulsifier usage The pyrolysis bio-oil has a chemical composition as follows: C (38.46%), H (6.81%), N (3.02%), O (37.16%), water content (14.56%). Its HHV and optimal HLB are 17.38 MJ kg−1 and 6.0, respectively. Other bio-oil properties and those of diesel, Atlox 4914 and alcohol co-surfactants such as density, viscosity, HHV, and pH value are summarized in Table 1 . The determination of minimum consumption of emulsifier is directly related to operating cost inasmuch as the price of emulsifier is by far higher than those of bio-oil and diesel. The profiles of the minimum emulsifier amount and B/E ratio versus bio-oil content yielding homogenous emulsions (2-h duration) are shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2a, the region below the curve represents unstable or phase separation region, whereas the region above the curve stands for the stable region where the mixture is fully emulsified and uniform for the given observation time. It is not surprising that the emulsifier requirement for successful emulsification increased with higher bio-oil content (Fig. 2a). However, it was observed that the minimum emulsifier amount decreased when the bio-oil content increased from 6 to 7 g. The dosage of 7 g bio-oil corresponds to 35 wt% of bio-oil used in the bio-oil and diesel mixture. In a water-in-oil (W/O) system, Chen and Tao [28] observed that there existed a surfactant concentration window, beyond this concentration range the stability quickly deteriorated. The stability of emulsion improved when the surfactant concentration was increased. However, once the surfactant concentration was increased beyond a certain value, emulsion stability decreased. They explained that the emulsion was not stable at low surfactant concentrations due to agglomeration of the oil droplets, whereas the emulsion destabilization occurred at high surfactant concentrations, as a result of rapid coalescence [28]. This may be the reason corresponding to the lower surfactant amount employed at 7 g of bio-oil when compared to that at 6 g of bio-oil. In Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the curve of B/E ratio monotonically increases with increasing bio-oil content. As described earlier, the emulsifier limit is determined by devising several emulsification experiments having 2 g of bio-oil and varying amounts of emulsifier where the weight of the mixture of bio-oil, diesel, and emulsifier is fixed at 20 g. The emulsifier (B/E) ratio increases with the increase of bio-oil content is due to that the increased extent in the bio-oil was higher than that in the emulsifier. Nevertheless, it should be underlined that the required emulsifier for successful emulsification is higher at higher bio-oil content, as shown in Fig. 2a. In other words, the relative amount of Atlox 4914 for the bio-oil emulsification can be reduced."
8,Effect of co-surfactant,"3.2 Effect of co-surfactant In general, the emulsifier amount must be increased to increase bio-oil usage in the emulsion. However, when the emulsifier amount increases, the viscosity of emulsion increases significantly and phase separation occurs. Alcohols are surface-active compounds that can lower the surface tension of bio-oil or dispersed phase, making them suitable as co-surfactants [25]. Weerachanchai [26] utilized ethanol and n-butanol, two straight-chain alcohols, as co-solvents to reduce the viscosity and improve the miscibility of fuel blend. Chiaramonti [29] reported that a higher emulsifier content had higher viscosity and stability of emulsion. However, too much emulsifier added into an emulsion made it more viscous so that they suggested using n-octanol to reduce the viscosity of emulsions with emulsifier levels higher than 2 wt%. For this reason, three different straight-chain alcohols, consisting of n-butanol, ethanol, and methanol, are used in the present study to facilitate emulsification, with emphasis on increasing bio-oil content in emulsion and reducing emulsifier consumption [24]. 3.2.1 n-butanol Fig. 3 shows the NIV profiles (2-h duration) of the emulsions with minimum surfactant dosages where the co-surfactant-to-emulsifier weight ratio (C/E ratio) varies from 0.2 to 1.2. As shown, the curves at 2, 3, and 4 g bio-oil are always lower than unity, denoting that successful emulsification is impossible. In contrast, for the higher bio-oil contents such as 5, 6, and 7 g, the addition of the co-surfactant is significant and conducive in improving emulsification as verified by two-factor analysis of variance where the resulting p-value of 0.0201 is below α (0.05). Similar observations were also reported in other studies [9]. Specifically, the higher the bio-oil amount, the smaller the critical C/E ratio for successful emulsification. This implies, in turn, that relatively less amount of co-surfactant is consumed to produce homogeneous emulsion at higher bio-oil amounts. Furthermore, the short-term (duration ≤ 2 h) and long-term (duration ≤ 60 days) NIV profiles at 5, 6, and 7 g bio-oil are displayed in Fig. 4 to examine the stability of the emulsions. For the case of 5 g bio-oil (Fig. 4a), the phase separation becomes pronounced with increasing time. Only at the condition of C/E = 1.2 that the emulsion can remain for 60 days without phase separation. With 6 g bio-oil (Fig. 4b), the emulsion stability was substantially improved. Specifically, stable emulsions at the end of 60 days were still obtained when emulsification runs were conducted at C/E ≥ 0.8. In other words, the operation of emulsification with 6 g bio-oil was more flexible than that with 5 g bio-oil. As for emulsions containing 7 g bio-oil (Fig. 4c), the critical C/E ratio can be further lowered to 0.7 for successful emulsification, implying that less amount of co-surfactant is needed to produce stable emulsion. Considering emulsions without phase separation for 60 days, they can be stored longer for further consumption, say, combustion. Statistical error analysis also validated the findings where a two-way analysis of variance showed that co-surfactant addition provided significant improvement in emulsification and stability, p-value 0.0091 < 0.05 (α). Accordingly, Fig. 4 has provided a useful insight into the practical applications of emulsification of pyrolysis bio-oil and diesel using the surfactant and the co-surfactant (viz. n-butanol). On account of lower viscosity and density of the co-surfactant, the viscosity and density of the emulsion is lessened when n-butanol is added [9]. Moreover, with the aid of the n-butanol co-surfactant, the emulsion stability is improved, even the bio-oil content increases (Fig. 4). This phenomenon can be explained by OH and CO functional groups present in the bio-oil, diesel, surfactant, and co-surfactant where their FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. 5 [6]. The significant presence of OH and CO functional groups in the bio-oil (Fig. 5a) suggests that it can be considered as the water-like compound in this water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. These functional groups induce hydrogen bonding because of the highly electronegative oxygen atom [30–32]. The electronegativities of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen are 3.44 [31,32], 2.5 [32], and 2.1 [33], respectively. Therefore, oxygen exerts very strong pull into the electrons shared in the OH bond and creates a polarity in the covalent bond between O and H. The same phenomenon is also exhibited for the functional group CO [32]. These functional groups enhance the emulsification mechanism (Fig. 6 a) through alcohol forming hydrogen bonding with the bio-oil. Alcohol co-surfactants insert into the gaps and seams of the emulsion micelle formed by the emulsifier Atlox 4914 (Fig. 6b). This phenomenon secures the emulsion from agglomeration with other bio-oil and coalescence with other emulsion micelle through improved steric repulsion forces (Fig. 6a). 3.2.2 Ethanol and methanol The short-term and long-term NIV profiles at 5, 6, and 7 g bio-oil using ethanol and methanol as co-surfactants are displayed in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. For the cases of 6 g and 7 g bio-oil, the NIV value in the short-term observations is always unity (Fig. 7a and b). For the long-term observations, the NIV values is no less than 0.9. Moreover, the results of NIV = 1 cover wider regions of C/E ratio, in contrast to the results in Fig. 4. These characteristics clearly demonstrate better emulsification performance and emulsion stability when using ethanol as the co-surfactant rather than using n-butanol. As for methanol that was adopted as the co-surfactant, Fig. 8 depicts that all emulsions remained homogenous for 60 days, except for the case of 5 g bio-oil with C/E = 0.2. It follows that using methanol as co-surfactant further enhances the emulsification performance and emulsion stability of the bio-oil emulsion. The FTIR spectra at three regions (i.e., top, middle, and bottom liquid levels in the tube) in the emulsion under 7 g bio-oil in diesel at C/E = 0.9 for 1 and 60 days are displayed in Fig. 9 . The FTIR curves are shown to have almost overlap and coincide together, confirming homogeneity and successful emulsification [6]. Further analysis of the sample group using single factor analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) validated that there was no significant difference among the three regions of both 1 day and 60 days FTIR curves where p values 0.1324 (1 day) and 0.3054 (60 days) were greater than α-value 0.05."
9,Mechanism of adding co-surfactant,"3.3 Mechanism of adding co-surfactant The profiles of NIV value based on 5 g bio-oil in diesel emulsion using the three different co-surfactants for four different durations of 1, 20, 30, and 60 days are displayed in Fig. 10 . Apparently, the performance of the three co-surfactants is ranked by methanol > ethanol > n-butanol, with methanol yielding very stable emulsions. Alternatively, n-butanol exhibits poor performance where only one sample remains stable after 60 days. These characteristics can be explained by two factors: (1) the molecular structure and size of the alcohol molecules, and (2) density difference and viscosity. 3.3.1 Molecular structure Typically, the emulsifier surrounds the molecule of the dispersed phase by attaching the hydrophilic head into the polar bio-oil molecule of the dispersed phase (Fig. 6). On the other end of the emulsifier, the non-polar lipophilic tail covers the micelle on the outer side and freely interacts with the non-polar diesel molecules. In addition, alcohol co-surfactant OH head is significantly smaller than that of the emulsifier head [25] which enables the alcohol co-surfactant to fit into the seams and gaps of the emulsion micelle that encapsulates the bio-oil and provide further steric repulsion and dispersion (Fig. 6). Therefore, the addition of alcohol co-surfactants really exerts significant improvement on the emulsification with smaller and more dispersed emulsion micelles. Furthermore, emulsion micelle sizes were observed to be reduced in size upon the addition of alcohol co-surfactants [25]. In alcohols, the carbon connecting hydroxyl functional group (OH) is known as the primary carbon (CH2 OH) [30,31]. Methanol, a single carbon alcohol, is essentially a smaller molecule when compared to the two-carbon and four-carbon alcohols, namely, ethanol and n-butanol. The role played by hydroxyl group (OH) for hydrogen bonding in n-butanol is weaker than in ethanol and methanol because of the dissipation of the electronegativity and bond strength. Consequently, methanol has the highest polarity and better hydrogen bonding properties which enable the emulsion to bond together much better and enhance the overall stability of the emulsion. Based on hydrogen bonding, polarity and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), methanol has higher HLB (Table 2 ) and thus better solubility in polar fluids, making methanol co-surfactant mixing into the bio-oil very well. On the other hand, among the three alcohol co-surfactants used in this research, n-butanol molecule with longest and biggest molecule puts a negative effect in the formation of the emulsion micelle. n-butanol, being the larger and longer co-surfactant alcohol molecule, cramps up and destabilizes the emulsion micelle, thus leading to its breakdown or physically observed as the phase separation of the emulsion. Furthermore, the solubility of alcohols in water depends on the OH functional group of the alcohol and its ability to form hydrogen bonding with polar or water-like molecules [25]. As such, when the chain length of the co-surfactant increases, the ratio of the hydrophilic head of the emulsifier to the lipophilic alkyl tail or HLB decreases, which directly results into lower hydrogen bonding and thus, decrease in solubility. 3.3.2 Density difference and viscosity Abismail et al. [17] explained that the density difference between the continuous and dispersed phases was a major factor in emulsion stability; the continuous phase viscosity and the droplet size were also crucial factors determining the emulsion stability. Consequently, the success of alcohol co-surfactants in this experiment could also be explained by its effect on density and viscosity properties of the disperse phase, continuous phase and emulsion micelle. From Table 2, the density of pyrolysis bio-oil and diesel are 1020 kg m−3 and 832 kg m−3, respectively and this density difference partially explains immiscibility of the two fluids [6]. Emulsification overcomes immiscibility of fluids by isolating the bio-oil molecule by being encapsulated by the emulsifier and co-surfactant molecules forming an emulsion micelle. The densities of Atlox 4914 and methanol are 970 kg m−3 and 792 kg m−3, respectively as shown in Table 2. The effect of the bio-oil density is reduced inasmuch as the overall density of the emulsion micelle is closer to that of diesel, making the emulsion more stable. In terms of viscosity, alcohols have the capacity to reduce the viscosity of bio-oil [9,24,34] and, in turn, improves the stability of emulsion [17]."
10,Effect of mixing method,"3.4 Effect of mixing method The NIV profiles at three different bio-oil contents within 2 h are examined in Fig. 11 where three different mixing mechanisms, the vortex mixer with 3000 rpm and the blender with 13,000 and 17,000 rpm, were considered. The emulsions prepared in this section were based the minimum C/E ratio shown in Fig. 3 (i.e., 5 g bio-oil at C/E ratio = 1, 6 g at C/E = 0.6, and 7 g at C/E = 0.5). Overall, the NIV profiles show that the vortex mixer provides the better performance. Meanwhile, the emulsification using the blender at 17,000 rpm yields better performance compared to that at 13,000 rpm, as a consequence of slower phase separation. The emulsions produced by the vortex mixer pertains to a non-contact mixing method in nature, and the mechanism emulsifying the mixture is due to the vibration among bio-oil, diesel, and surfactant. This provides a more uniform energy distribution while emulsifying. In contrast, the mixture in the blender is emulsified through mechanical agitation where the blades in the blender remain in contact with the emulsion. The study of Abismail et al. [17] reported that an optimum amount of energy is required to produce a good quality emulsion. Energy in excess of the optimum amount was dispersed as heat. Thus, putting more energy into the emulsion might lead to the degradation of the emulsifier. This explains the better performance of the vortex mixer. Nevertheless, the NIV profiles in Fig. 12 (60-day observation) confirm that the emulsions produced using the vortex mixer became the least stable and showed faster phase separation. In addition, when the bio-oil content increased from 5 g to 7 g, the NIV curves pertaining to the vortex mixer dropped rapidly. These results show that using the vortex mixer as a mixing method is not effective in the long-term stability of emulsion. It was mentioned that prolonging the mixing of the sample for emulsification beyond the optimum time did not improve the stability and homogeneity of the emulsion [28]. It is also true with the mixing speed effect on emulsification where a certain mixing range enables better mixing and emulsification but beyond this range phase separation and emulsion deterioration occurs. In this study for the blender speed between 13,000 and 17,000 rpm, the high mixing speed offers a better mixing, elucidating its more efficient energy usage for emulsification."
11,Comparison with other studies,"3.5 Comparison with other studies A summary of various emulsification studies on bio-oil in diesel blends is presented in Table 3 . As shown, the use of low mixing speeds (up to 3000 rpm) for low bio-oil content (up to 10%) results in emulsion stabilities from <3 to 42 days. At higher bio-oil content (20–30 wt%), however, the subsequent emulsions have lower stabilities (<5–17 days) while increasing the mixing speed to greater than 5000 rpm, further reduces emulsion stabilities to 5 days. In contrast, the results of the present study show that at low mixing speed of 3000 rpm, pyrolysis bio-oil in diesel blends remains stable up to 60 days even when the amount of bio-oil is raised to 35 wt%. These findings affirm the potential of utilizing much higher amounts of renewable and cleaner bio-oil in diesel emulsions to be used as fuel in industrial generators, furnace units and diesel engines."
12,Conclusions,"The emulsification of pyrolysis bio-oil and diesel with the aid of a commercial emulsifier (Atlox 4914) and three different alcohol co-surfactants (i.e., n-butanol, ethanol, and methanol) have been explored. The results of the study show that higher amounts of bio-oil can be blended in diesel with lower amounts of the chemical emulsifier while simultaneously extending the stability and improving the viscosity of the ensuing emulsions. The co-surfactants help improve the stability of the emulsions by effectively producing emulsion micelles, reducing the density difference between the continuous phase and droplet phase, and lowering the viscosity of the fuel product. Short-chain alcohols induce stronger hydrogen bonding and have higher polarity and HLB. As a consequence, the performance of the co-surfactants is characterized by the order: methanol > ethanol > n-butanol. The influence of three mixing modes (i.e., a vortex mixer with 3000 rpm and a blender with 13,000 and 17,000 rpm) on emulsion stability with n-butanol is also evaluated. The emulsification using the vortex mixer provides a better short-term performance due to more uniform energy distribution in the emulsions. Nevertheless, the higher speed blender results in better emulsion stability which shows that an off-the-shelf blender may be adopted as an inexpensive and simple way to homogenize bio-oil and diesel mixtures. Lastly, the study shows the potential of using diesel emulsions with up to 35% bio-oil content compared to biodiesel-blended diesel fuel which still at 2%–5% in most countries."
