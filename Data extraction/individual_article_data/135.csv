0,Introduction,"The continuous rise of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been causing notable greenhouse effects, drawing researchers’ attention to reducing the consumption of fossil energy and to keeping the balance of carbon in the environment [1]. The strategies for reducing CO2 emission mainly include the capture and storage and the utilization of CO2 [2]. The hydrogenation of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels is a promising route, providing products such as CO [3], methanol [4], hydrocarbons [5], and higher alcohols [6]. Among these, the synthesis of higher alcohols from CO2 hydrogenation is a challenging task. On one hand, the hydrogenation of CO2 is relatively difficult, because CO2 is a fully oxidized, thermodynamically stable, and chemically inert molecule. On the other hand, a high hydrogen/carbon ratio on a catalyst surface favors the fast hydrogenation of surface intermediates, tending to form short-chain products, such as CO, methanol, and methane [7]. The term “higher alcohols” (HAs) refers to a mixture of C2–C4 alcohols with high energy density and good blending flexibility. These properties make HAs a promising alternative fuel for vehicles [8]. It has generally been accepted that the transformation of CO2 into HAs proceeds in two steps. First, CO is produced by the hydrogenation of CO2 through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Second, CO is further hydrogenated to HAs [9]. Based on this speculation, some multiple catalysts such as K/Cu–Zn–Fe catalysts [10] and Mo–Co–K sulfide catalysts [11] have been studied in fixed-bed reactors. Cobalt catalysts have been widely used industrially in the transformation of syngas into liquid fuel. However, cobalt catalysts show very low WGS activity and act primarily as methanation catalysts when CO2 is used instead of CO [12]. Davis studied a 1%Na20%Co/SiO2 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation in a fixed-bed reaction and found that CoO and Co2C phases were formed after CO activation, and that the alcohol selectivity increased significantly [13]. In our earlier research, a Pt/Co3O4 catalyst with a different morphology of Co3O4 (nanorods and nanoplates) was prepared and showed a high HA yield of 0.56 mmol gcat −1 h−1 at 200 °C and 2 MPa. It was found that Co3O4 nanorods were partially reduced to metallic Co and CoO after 200 °C reduction under H2. When the reduction temperature was increased further to 250 °C, more Co3O4 was reduced to metallic Co, while the alcohol selectivity decreased and the methane selectivity increased. From these facts, we concluded that partly reduced Co3O4 nanorods together with Pt and Co nanoparticles, Pt–Co/Co3O4- x , were the active site for CTHA reactions [14]. Mesoporous metal oxides with high thermal stability, high surface area, and crystalline frameworks have been designed for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction [15]. Li et al. discovered a highly active and selective CO2 hydrogenation catalyst for methanol synthesis comprising MnO x nanoparticles supported on mesoporous cobalt oxide. The active phase of the catalyst was determined as MnO x nanoparticles dispersed over grains of cobalt comprising CoO surfaces with metallic Co cores [16]. In this paper, a mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst was prepared and applied in the hydrogenation of CO2 into HAs. For comparison, Co3O4 nanoparticles and Pt supported on mesoporous Co3O4 were also prepared and studied in this transformation. The physical structure and chemical properties were studied using BET, TEM, in situ reduction XRD, and H2 TPR. The results showed that Co3O4 catalysts with ordered mesoporous structure (denoted as Co3O4-m hereafter) could promote the growth of carbon chains for higher hydrocarbon and alcohol production. For the Pt/Co3O4-m catalyst, the CO2 conversion and selectivity of CH4 decreased further, while the selectivity for CO and alcohols increased, owing to the RWGS ability of Pt. However, the total yield of HAs from Pt/Co3O4-m (1.5 mmol gcat −1 h−1) was slightly lower than that from Co3O4-m (1.6 mmol gcat −1 h−1) under the same reaction conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of mesoporous silica Mesoporous silica (KIT-6) particles were synthesized according to the literature [17]. In a typical synthesis, 4.0 g of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123, PEO20-PPO70- PEO20, Aldrich) was dissolved in a mixture of 144 g of deionized water and 7.9 g of HCl (36–38 wt%), and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. Then 4.0 g of n-butanol was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 1 h. TEOS (8.6 g) was then added. The mixture was left under stirring for 24 h at 35 °C and subsequently hydrothermally heated for 24 h at 100 °C under static conditions in a closed polypropylene bottle. The solid product was filtered and washed with ethanol and deionized water, dried at 80 °C overnight, and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. 2.1.2 Preparation of mesoporous Co3O4 KIT-6 (6.0 g) was added into 3.0 ml of 4.6 mol/L Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution and subsequently heated for 12 h at 60 °C in a closed polypropylene bottle. The crystallization temperature in the closed vessel was then increased to 200 °C for another 6 h. The composites were dried and calcined at 500 °C for 6 h to decompose the nitrate precursor into oxides. The silica templates were removed by 2 mol/L NaOH and washing with distilled water. A black powder, mesoporous Co3O4-m particles, was obtained by centrifugation and dried at 100 °C. 2.1.3 Preparation of Co3O4 nanoparticles Co3O4 nanoparticles (abbreviated as Co3O4-np) were prepared with a precipitation method from a basic solution of Co(NO3)2. The pH was adjusted to 8–9 with a 30% solution of NH3OH. The precipitated Co(OH)2 was filtered out and washed with distilled water until pH 7. The product was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined in air at 450 °C for 4 h. 2.1.4 Preparation of Pt/Co3O4-m H2PtCl6 (0.027 g) in 5 ml of deionized water was added into 1 g of mesoporous Co3O4. The product was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined in air at 300 °C for 2 h. The obtained catalyst was denoted as Pt/Co3O4-m. The weight content of Pt was ∼1% in theory."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were obtained with an FEI Tecnai G20 instrument. The samples were prepared by directly suspending the catalyst in ethanol with ultrasonic treatment. A copper microscope grid covered with perforated carbon was dipped into the solution and then dried. The BET surface area of the prepared materials was determined by physisorption of N2 at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-C-MS instrument. About 200 mg samples were degassed under vacuum at 350 °C for 3 h prior to the measurements to remove the prep-adsorbed components. The specific surface area was determined from the linear portion of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) plot. The total pore volumes and the average pore sizes were calculated from the desorption branch of the adsorption isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) formula. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were measured in the range 10–80° on a Bruker-D8 diffractometer with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA and collected with a Vantec-1 detector. The small-angle XRD patterns of KIT-6 and mesoporous Co3O4 were measured in the range 0–5°. The in situ reduction XRD of Co3O4-m, Co3O4-np, and Pt/Co3O4-m was also measured. The samples were first introduced under H2 at room temperature and then the temperature was increased to 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 °C at 2 °C/min. The samples were kept at 250 and 300 °C for 2 h and the initial and final data were collected. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 TPR) experiments were carried out using AMI-200 from Zeton Altamira Company. The samples (50 mg) were purged with 30 ml/min Ar in a quartz reactor while being heated at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min to 150 °C, and that temperature was maintained for 1 h to remove traces of water. After cooling to 50 °C, the samples were reduced in a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar (30 ml/min) while being heated from 50 to 600 °C at 10 °C/min."
4,Typical procedure for CO2 hydrogenation,"2.3 Typical procedure for CO2 hydrogenation All catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed stainless steel minireactor (length 53 cm and inside diameter 8 mm) at a total pressure at 2 MPa. The reactor system was equipped with a programmable temperature controller. Typically, the catalyst (0.2 g) was mixed with silica (0.2 g) and then reduced with H2 (1 atm) at 250 or 300 °C for 2 h. Then the catalysts were cooled to room temperature under H2. Mixed gases (22% CO2, 66% H2, and 12% N2) were introduced into the system, while the pressure was increased slowly to 2 MPa and the bed temperature was increased to 160 and 200 °C (2 °C/min). For abbreviation, Co3O4-m-300/200 represents the mesoporous Co3O4 reduced at 300 °C and tested at 200 °C, etc. The GHSV was 6 L h−1 gcat −1. The gas products were analyzed on line with an Agilent 3000 gas chromatograph (thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors). The liquid product was collected in a cold trap and analyzed off line with a 4890 gas chromatograph (flame ionization detectors). The reaction parameters of CO2 conversion, selectivity, and space time yield (STY) are defined as follows (where ROH refers to total alcohols): X CO2 = n CO2,in - n CO2,out n CO2,in , selectivity = n product,out × carbon number n CO2,in - n CO2,out ST Y ROH = F CO2,in × X CO2 × 60 × S ROH 22.4 × m cat ( mmol · g cat - 1 · h - 1 ) ST Y HAs = F CO2,in × X CO2 × 60 × S HAs 22.4 × m cat ( mmol · g cat - 1 · h - 1 ) . After 50 h of reaction, CO2 conversion and gas products selectivity became stable and were recorded, while the liquid products selectivity was calculated as the average value."

6,Characterization of Co3O4 catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of Co3O4 catalysts The structure of KIT-6 was confirmed by small-angle XRD and BET results, as shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Material. The surface area of KIT-6 was determined to be 728.2 m2/g, and the total pore volume and pore diameter were 0.87 ml/g and 6.6 nm, respectively. Fig. 1 shows typical TEM images of KIT-6, Co3O4-m, and Co3O4-np. From the images, it was observed that the mesoporous structure of Co3O4-m crystals was kept during the crystallization process. The Co3O4-m sample actually accumulated uniform small particles with a size of about 5 nm. The (3 1 1) and (2 2 0) planes of Co3O4 were found in the HRTEM profiles of Co3O4-m. Co3O4-np had a uniform particle size of about 30 nm. Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2018.07.019. The structure of KIT-6 was confirmed by small-angle XRD and BET results, as shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Material . The surface area of KIT-6 was determined to be 728.2 m2/g, and the total pore volume and pore diameter were 0.87 ml/g and 6.6 nm, respectively. Fig. 1 shows typical TEM images of KIT-6, Co3O4-m, and Co3O4-np. From the images, it was observed that the mesoporous structure of Co3O4-m crystals was kept during the crystallization process. The Co3O4-m sample actually accumulated uniform small particles with a size of about 5 nm. The (3 1 1) and (2 2 0) planes of Co3O4 were found in the HRTEM profiles of Co3O4-m. Co3O4-np had a uniform particle size of about 30 nm. The crystal structures of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np were characterized by XRD patterns. The face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of Co3O4 was identified (JCPDS 42-1467). The small-angle XRD of Co3O4-m is shown in Fig. S1. The peak from the (2 1 1) plane of la–3d mesostructural symmetry was observed at about 1.0° and the position was the same as that of the original KIT-6 [17]. The crystal sizes of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np were calculated through the Debye-Scherrer equation with the main peak at 36.8° and determined as 15 and 22 nm, respectively (see Fig. 2 ). The crystal structures of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np were characterized by XRD patterns. The face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of Co3O4 was identified (JCPDS 42-1467). The small-angle XRD of Co3O4-m is shown in Fig. S1. The peak from the (2 1 1) plane of la–3d mesostructural symmetry was observed at about 1.0° and the position was the same as that of the original KIT-6 [17]. The crystal sizes of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np were calculated through the Debye-Scherrer equation with the main peak at 36.8° and determined as 15 and 22 nm, respectively (see Fig. 2 ). H2 TPR profiles of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np are shown in Fig. 3 . Co3O4-m shows two distinct reduction peaks at 298 and 371 °C, corresponding to the reduction from Co3O4 to CoO and the subsequent reduction of CoO to metallic Co, respectively [18]. The shoulder peak at 334 °C between the two main peaks at 298 and 371 °C was ascribed to the two particle sizes of Co3O4-m. The second reduction peak became much sharper and shifted to lower temperature (357 °C) for Co3O4-np, indicating that Co3O4-np was reduced more easily than Co3O4-m. The physical structure of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np is shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1 . Both samples show a typical IV isotherm curve with an H3 hysteresis loop, indicating a mesoporous structure in both. The surface areas were 87 and 21 m2/g, and the total pore volumes were 0.25 and 0.19 ml/g for Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np, respectively. For Co3O4-m, the pore size distribution centered at 4–9 nm and the average pore size was 8.9 nm. For Co3O4-np, there were two sizes of pores due to the accumulation of particles, 3 and 35 nm, respectively, and the average pore diameter was 34 nm. The in situ reduction XRD of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np is shown in Fig. 5 . The Co3O4 phase remained below 200 °C after H2 reduction both for Co3O4-m and for Co3O4-np. The Co3O4 phase totally disappeared both for Co3O4-m and for Co3O4-np when the reduction temperature increased to 250 °C. The peaks belonging to CoO and FCC metallic Co were noted for Co3O4-m, while three types of cobalt species were observed for Co3O4-np at 250 °C: CoO, FCC metallic Co, and HCP (hexagonal close-packed) metallic Co. The peak intensity of FCC Co, which indicated the amount of FCC Co, further increased after 2 h at 250 °C at the expense of the CoO phase. After the reduction temperature was increased to 300 °C, the CoO phase almost disappeared, and the HCP Co also appeared for Co3O4-m. When the in situ reduction XRD profiles of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np are compared, it can be found that Co3O4-np was much more easily reduced than Co3O4-m, as the CoO phase almost disappeared after reduction at 250 °C for 2 h. The reduction temperature of metallic Co in situ XRD results was lower than the H2 TPR results for both Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np, because 10% H2/Ar was used in the H2 TPR experiment, but pure H2 was used in the in situ XRD experiment. However, the conclusion that Co3O4-np was more easily reduced than Co3O4-m was consistent in both H2 TPR and in situ XRD experiments."
7,Catalytic activity of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np,"3.2 Catalytic activity of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np The catalytic performance of Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np was evaluated by the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at 160 and 200 °C, successively. CO2 conversion and products selectivity are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively, while the STY of ROH and HAs is shown in Fig. 8 . It was noted that Co3O4-m-300/200 had the highest STY of HAs. Co3O4-m-300/200 and Co3O4-np-300/200 led to almost the same CO2 conversion (Fig. 6). However, the selectivity of HAs of Co3O4-m-300/200 was significantly higher than that of Co3O4-np-300/200. CO2 conversion is directly related to the content of available sites of metallic Co, which was generated by the partial reduction of Co3O4 at a reducing temperature of above 250 °C, due to its supply of dissociative hydrogen on the surface [19,20]. Since the content of metallic Co in both Co3O4-m and Co3O4-np, as shown in Fig. 5, increased with the reducing temperature, higher CO2 conversion was obtained on both Co3O4-m-300 and Co3O4-np-300 catalysts. Although metallic Co led to good CO2 conversion, it predominantly produced methane in the process of CO2 hydrogenation [21]. In contrast, partially reduced Co3O4, which formed oxygen vacancies on the surface, improved the dissociation of CO2 and tended to produce desired HAs [22]. Furthermore, as the reaction temperature increased from 160 to 200 °C, CO2 conversion increased notably, while the selectivity for total alcohols decreased. Since the CO2 hydrogenation reaction was exothermic, low temperatures should be thermodynamically favorable in the conversion of CO2. However, the actual CO2 conversion was much lower than the theoretical equilibrium value. Thus, CO2 conversion was mainly affected by dynamic factors. The yield of HAs also increased with an increase in the reaction temperature. As shown in Fig. 8A, the STY of HAs was 1.3 and 1.6 mmol gcat −1 h−1 at 160 and 200 °C, respectively. This was because the HAs reaction was more thermodynamically favorable than that of methanol [9]. Combining both effects, the reaction temperature of 200 °C could be chosen to obtain an optimal STY of HAs in this test. The FCC metallic Co became the main species, while CoO and HCP metallic Co both were present for the Co3O4-m reduction at 300 °C. The Co3O4-np sample had a similar phase constitution at reduction temperature 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 5A and 5B. Therefore, we have compared the results of the hydrogenation of CO2 at 200 °C over two kinds of catalysts (Co3O4-np-300 and Co3O4-m-200), which have a similar phase of metallic Co. As shown in Fig. 8, the STY of ROH for Co3O4-m-300/200 was about 5 times that of Co3O4-np-250/200 (3.4 and 0.7 mmol gcat −1 h−1), but the STY of HAs for Co3O4-m-300/200 was 40 times that of Co3O4-np-250/200 (1.6 and 0.04 mmol gcat −1 h−1). As the Co3O4-m-300 and Co3O4-np-250 catalysts have similar content of metallic Co, the excellent catalytic performance of the Co3O4-m-300 catalyst in comparison with the Co3O4-np-250 should be related to the mesoporous structure of the catalysts. First of all, the confinement effect in mesoporous structure was beneficial for the growth of carbon chains. During the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, CO2 was hydrogenated first to CH x species (x = 2 or 3), which tend to contact one another in the mesoporous channels to form C2–4 chains, decreasing the possibility for CH x to further hydrogenate to CH4 directly (this situation might prevail on the surface of Co3O4-np). Thus, Co3O4-m would give a higher production of higher hydrocarbons (C2+H) and HAs [23]. Second, the catalytic performance of Co3O4-m remained stable during the 50 h reaction, yet that of Co3O4-np kept decreasing with reaction time. Its mesoporous structure, as well as its high surface area, should play a key role. All in all, Co3O4-m-300/200 was chosen as the optimal condition for the CO2 hydrogenation test. To further lower methane selectivity and produce CO, which could also be hydrogenated to produce alcohols, the noble metal Pt was introduced into the Co3O4-m catalyst. XRD and H2 TPR characterization of Pt/Co3O4-m are shown in Figs. S3 and S4. No diffraction peak for Pt was detected due to the high dispersion. The reduction peak of Co3O4 to CoO was shifted from 298 to 161 °C, thanks to the H2 spillover effect of Pt [19]. XRD and H2 TPR characterization of Pt/Co3O4-m are shown in Figs. S3 and S4. No diffraction peak for Pt was detected due to the high dispersion. The reduction peak of Co3O4 to CoO was shifted from 298 to 161 °C, thanks to the H2 spillover effect of Pt [19]. The in situ reduction XRD of Pt/Co3O4-m is shown in Fig. 9 . At as low as 150 °C, the diffraction peaks belonging to Co3O4 totally disappeared and the diffraction peaks belonging to CoO and FCC metallic Co appeared. At 200 °C, FCC metallic Co became the chief Co species, and HCP metallic Co was also detected. At 250°CC, the CoO phase totally disappeared, while FCC and HCP metallic Co showed up. Given the similar situation of Co3O4-m reduction at 300 °C, in which FCC metallic Co became the chief species while CoO and HCP metallic Co were both present, the reduction temperature of Pt/Co3O4-m was set as 200 °C. The catalyst activity of CO2 hydrogenation after 200 °C H2 reduction is shown in Fig. 10 . Compared with Co3O4-m-300/200, the methane selectivity of Pt/Co3O4-m-200/200 dropped sharply from 53.6 to 14.9%, while the selectivity of CO increased from zero to 28.3%, and the ROH selectivity increased from 19.2 to 47.2%. Meanwhile, CO2 conversion also decreased significantly, from 28.9 to 10.7%. The STY of ROH and HAs for Pt/Co3O4-m-200/200 was 3.0 and 1.5 mmol gcat −1 h−1, respectively, a little lower than that of Co3O4-m-300/200 (3.4 and 1.6 mmol gcat −1 h−1). In the research of Jones et al., it was found that CO2 conversion would decrease for Co-based catalyst after the addition of noble metals, such as Pd, Pt, or Ru [21]. Noble metals might have excellent RWGS activity but poor CO2 or CO hydrogenation activity. How to combine the advantages of both cobalt and noble metals to prepare more optimized catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation in the synthesis of HAs is a promising issue in this field."
8,Conclusions,"Ordered mesoporous Co3O4 was prepared by the use of KIT-6 as a hard template. For comparison, nanoparticle Co3O4 was also prepared. The two partially reduced Co3O4 samples with different pore structures were tested in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Characterizations and reaction results showed that the ordered mesoporous structure of Co3O4-m catalysts could promote the growth of carbon chains during CO2 hydrogenation, reducing the selectivity for CH4 and giving a higher production of HAs. The highest yield of HAs was obtained in 1.6 mmol g−1 h−1 over the Co3O4-m-300/200 catalyst. To reduce the byproduct selectivity of CH4, the noble metal Pt was introduced onto the Co3O4-m catalysts with the best catalytic performance. For Pt/Co3O4-m-200/200, owing to the RWGS ability of Pt, the selectivity for CH4 did decrease as expected, and the selectivity for CO and alcohols increased. However, the conversion of CO2 obviously decreased at the same time, leading to a lower yield (1.5 mmol gcat −1 h−1) of HAs than of Co3O4-m catalysts under the same conditions. Further and more detailed work could be carried out on this, by which a better balance of the two factors, selectivity and conversion, could be achieved."
