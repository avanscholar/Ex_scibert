0,Introduction,"Anthropogenic activities have significantly changed the planet and resulted in many environmental issues in recent centuries, such as global climate change, biodiversity loss, water and land pollution, and food and energy crises. Therefore, a sustainable and circular bioeconomy that can recycle nutrients and carbon for food production is eagerly needed to address these challenges (Stahel, 2016). Microbial protein (MP), or single cell protein (SCP), the protein-rich biomass and a sustainable substitution of traditional plant/animal-based protein (Matassa et al., 2016), is expected to be one of the potential solutions to feed the increasing population on the earth. Various microorganisms can produce microbial protein, including yeast, algae, fungi, and bacteria (Matassa et al., 2016). Among different candidates, hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB) is a special group of bacteria that can assimilate CO2 as biomass using H2 as an electron donor and O2 as an electron acceptor through the Calvin cycle or reverse-Kerbs cycle (Mishra et al., 2020). To feed the HOB, H2 and O2 can be generated through water splitting using renewable electric power; CO2 can be derived from industrial off-gas or raw biogas; and the nitrogen can be recovered from wastewater (Mishra et al., 2020). Therefore, MP production by HOB can be driven by electricity (namely Power-to-Protein) and is regarded as an essential part of the circular economy since it could close the loop of carbon and nitrogen. Currently, a pilot-scale MP production system has been established at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the Netherlands (Oesterholt et al., 2017). The system consists of i) water electrolysis unit (H2 and O2 source); ii) carbon dioxide capture unit (CO2 source); iii) ammonia recovery unit (nitrogen source); and finally, iv) HOB fermenter. Similarly, a laboratory electrochemical cell was set up to produce MP using ammonia recovered from source-separated urine (Christiaens et al., 2017). In the system, the hydrolyzed urine was firstly filled in the cathode chamber of the electrochemical cell. Ammonium was then separated in a stripping column and subsequently dissolved in sulfate acid solution in an adsorption column. Eventually, the HOB was cultivated in another bubble column using the recovered nitrogen. The complex processes which consisted of at least three separated units may increase land occupancy, labor intensity, and the total cost of MP production. To simplify the process, a single chamber water electrolyzer was developed and intensively investigated nowadays (Givirovskiy et al., 2019b, 2019a; Nyyssölä et al., 2021; Ruuskanen et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). In such a water electrolyzer, HOB can be in-situ cultivated using the hydrogen and oxygen generated from water splitting. However, the nitrogen source still needs to be externally provided from commercial sources (e. g., pure ammonium sulfate). In this context, microbial electrochemical technology (MET) is attractive because of its sustainability and versatility in energy and resources recovery, waste/wastewater treatment, and production of various value-added products (e.g., H2, CH4, H2O2, acids, alcohols, metals, biopolymers, and nutrients) (Kong et al., 2020; Sahoo et al., 2020). Especially, METs have shown promising potential as a sustainable approach for ammonia recovery from wastewater (Kelly and He, 2014; Sengupta et al., 2015). In METs such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), energy stored in organic matter can be converted to electricity by the electroactive microorganisms in the anode through bio-oxidation (Eq. 1). CH3COO– + 4 H2O → 2 HCO3 – + 9H+ + 8 e- (Eq. 1) The generated potential difference between anodic and cathodic electrodes can drive positively charged protons and ammonium ions to migrate from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber. Thus, MFC can recover ammonium without an external power supply. Another typical MET, microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), can also recover ammonium with an external power supply (Haddadi et al., 2013; Zhang and Angelidaki, 2015). With the contribution of the exoelectrogens, MFC could produce net energy than intensive energy consumption by the conventional air stripping (Kuntke et al., 2011). So far, the recovered ammonium through METs were usually extracted by precipitation or air stripping (Cusick et al., 2014; Kuntke et al., 2014), the in-situ assimilation and upcycling in cathode has barely been considered. Besides ammonium recovery, the METs also showed potential for electrosynthesis from CO2 (Bian et al., 2020; Majumdar et al., 2017; Torella et al., 2015). However, the nitrogen sources for microbial growth during electrosynthesis are always commercial chemicals that are directly dosed into medium. In this study, a novel hybrid biological-inorganic (HBI) system, which integrated microbial electrochemical ammonia recovery with the Power-to-Protein process, was developed and investigated for simultaneous residual ammonium recovery and in-situ upcycling for MP production. The HBI system was developed by merging water electrolysis and HOB cultivation into a typical two-chambered MFC cathode. In this system, ammonium transportation from the anode to the cathode chamber (for recovery) was driven by the energy harvested from wastewater by exoelectrogens. After that, the ammonium recovered in the cathode chamber was in-situ utilized by HOB (Eq. 2, (Yu and Lu, 2019)) using hydrogen and oxygen generated from water electrolysis (Eq. 3 and 4). The proof-of-concept tests using synthetic municipal wastewater were first conducted. Moreover, the effect of carbon dioxide amount on the system performance was investigated. Afterward, the HBI system was further tested at different operation modes (MFC and MEC). Finally, real municipal wastewater was employed to verify the feasibility of recovering and upcycling wasted nitrogen from wastewater to MP by the system. CO2 + 5.06 H2 + 1.51 O2 + 0.24 NH3 → CH1.68O0.46N0.24 + 4.56 H2O (Eq. 2) 4 H2O + 4 e- → 4 OH– + 2 H2 (Eq. 3) 2 H2O → 4H+ + 4 e- + O2 (Eq. 4)"
1,Material and methods,
2,HBI system setup and operation,"2.1 HBI system setup and operation A typical two-chambered MET unit was first set up. Two rectangular polymethyl methacrylate frames, silicone pads, and a cation exchange membrane (CEM) (CMI 7001, Membrane International, NJ, USA) were in turn arranged and tightly assembled using steel screws, bolts, and nuts. The working volumes of the two chambers were 170 and 270 mL, for the anode and cathode chamber, respectively. A pretreated carbon brush (Mill-Rose, USA) (Zhang and Angelidaki, 2015) was used as the anode electrode. Synthetic wastewater which contains 1 g/L of CH3COONa, 0.19 g/L of NH4Cl (50 mg N-NH4 +/L), 2.77 g/L of NaH2PO4·2H2O, 4.58 g/L of Na2HOP4, 0.13 g/L of KCl, 0.19 g/L of MgSO4, 0.1 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 2.5 mL/L mineral elements solution and 12.5 mL/L of vitamin solution was used as anolyte. The recipe of mineral elements solution and vitamin solution was prepared as previously reported (Lovley and Phillips, 1988). The synthetic wastewater had a conductivity of 7.5 mS/cm. A titanium mesh (4 × 4 cm) was used as cathode electrode. During the exoelectrogens enrichment period, 50 mM sodium sulfate solution was used as catholyte. A resistor of 1 kΩ was connected to the two electrodes therefore the MET unit was operated as an MFC. The potential across the resistor was recorded by a digital multimeter (Model 2700, Keithley Instruments, Inc., USA) every thirty minutes. Influent from municipal WWTP (see supplementary material) was firstly filled in the anode chamber as an inoculum. Afterward, the deoxidized synthetic anolyte was used to support the growth of exoelectrogens. The MFC was operated at batch mode, therefore, the anolyte and catholyte were refreshed regularly. After the recorded potential could repeatably reach 0.2 V or higher, the MFC was then changed to the HBI rector (Fig. 1 ). The catholyte was then changed to a medium modified from a typical HOB medium by replacing the chlorine salts (CaCl2 and MnCl2) with corresponding sulfate salts (Yang et al., 2022), increasing the conductivity to 7.5 mS/cm by adding 2.5 g/L of Na2SO4, and excluding the ammonium salt. An alloy mesh (4 × 4 cm) coated with IrO2 and a titanium mesh (4 × 4 cm) were used respectively as the anode and cathode for water electrolysis. An external power supply was used to drive water splitting. A gas recycling bag was connected to the cathode chamber to balance the atmospheric pressure. The gas inside was continuously pumped (5 mL/min) into the catholyte through an aerator (5 μm, Brewferm, Belgium)."
3,Microbial protein production,"2.2 Microbial protein production The purchased strain Cupriavidus necator 335 (DSMZ, Germany) was chosen to produce MP. The strain was autotrophically cultivated in a sealed serum bottle using CO2, O2, H2, and ammonium chloride (0.26 g N-NH4 +/L) as substrates (Yang et al., 2021a). For MP production, an adequate amount of culture from the exponential phase was inoculated in the cathode chamber to reach an initial optical density at a wavelength of 660 nm (OD660) of 0.1 every time. After inoculation, a constant voltage of 3 V was supplied to the HBI by the external power supply to drive water electrolysis. Thus, O2 and H2 generated could be in-situ utilized by C. necator 335. 250 mL of CO2 was initially added to the recycling bag as a carbon source. The OD660 was recorded by a spectrophotometer every 12 h. After cultivation, the catholyte was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min. The precipitates were washed with deionized water three times and then dried in an oven at 110 ℃ overnight. The weight of the dried biomass was defined as cell dry weight (CDW)."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure Proof-of-concept and control experiments were first conducted. In the proof-of-concept experiment, 3 V was applied to the pair of electrodes immersed in the cathode chamber to drive water electrolysis and C. necator 335 was inoculated. CO2 (250 mL) was injected into the gas recycling bag, and the gases were recycled. In the Control_1 experiment, - aiming to elucidate the ammonia mitigation - the system was operated as a conventional MFC except that the cathode chamber was closed and disconnected from the gas recycling bag. A nitrogen-free medium was used as catholyte. Moreover, C. necator 335 was not inoculated to the medium in the cathode chamber. Therefore, the performance of the HBI system at MFC mode, including the ammonium migration from the anode chamber to cathode chamber, was investigated. In the Control_2 experiment, - aiming to investigate water electrolysis − 3 V was applied to the pair of electrodes immersed in the cathode chamber to drive water electrolysis. C. necator 335 was not inoculated. External CO2 was not supplied, but the generated gases in the cathode chamber were recycled in the medium through a pump and the gas recycling bag. In the Control_3 experiment, - aiming to elucidate the MFC efficiency - the system was still conducted as an MFC without an external power supply. The gas recycling bag was disconnected, and the air was flushed into the cathode chamber through a peristaltic pump. C. necator 335 was not inoculated. Subsequently, different initial amounts of CO2 (250 mL, 1 L, and 2 L) were supplied in the gas recycling bag to investigate their potential impact on the system performance. Afterward, 2 L CO2 was added to the recycling bag to ensure a sufficient carbon source supply. The system was operated at different modes (MFC and MEC) for this test. Finally, the applicability of the proposed HBI system was validated with an actual waste stream, i.e., influent from municipal WWTP (see supplementary material)."
5,Chemical analysis and calculations,"2.4 Chemical analysis and calculations Gas components (CO2, H2, and O2) were quantified by gas chromatography (Trace 1310, Thermo Scientific, USA) using the methods described before (Li et al., 2020). Ammonium concentration was determined by a commercial kit (Ammonium Test Kit 100683, Merck, Germany). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the municipal wastewater before and after treatment was determined by kit (COD cuvette test, LCI 500, Hach, USA). The total nitrogen (TN) in the catholyte after cultivation was quantified by kit (Total Nitrogen cuvette test, APC 238, Hach, USA). The crude protein amount was calculated by multiplying the TN by the factor of 5.6 (Mariotti et al., 2008). The protein content was obtained by dividing the CDW by crude protein amount."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Proof of concept,"3.1 Proof of concept In the present study, the proposed HBI system aimed to realize ammonium recovery without external power supply but using wastewater to sustain the nitrogen recovery process which can be used for SCP production. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the growth of C. necator 335 was observed in the cathode chamber (Fig. 2 A). The OD660 went up to 0.46 after 24 h. After a short stationary phase (12 h), the OD decreased sharply. The pH of catholyte quickly declined due to the dissolution of CO2 (Fig. 2B). The ammonium removal rate from the anode chamber was 76.71 mg N/(m2·h) (Fig. 2C). In catholyte, the ammonium concentration first decreased to 0 at 24 h and then began to increase. The result was consistent with the growth of C. necator 335. In the first 24 h, the bacterium grew fast, and thus, the migrated ammonium was quickly uptaken by the bacterium. Afterward, the ammonium concentration began to increase because bacterial growth ceased. Moreover, the high nitrogen accumulation rate in 36 ∼ 48 h in the cathode chamber could be due to the release of ammonium from cells. It was assumed that about 0.9 mg N was consumed by microbes in the anode while 4.35 mg N (51.4% of the initial N input) was assimilated by C. necator 335 in the cathode chamber. In Control_1, the system was only operated for 24 h because the current was relatively low (lower than 10 μA after 16 h, see supplementary material). The low current was probably due to the scarcity of electron acceptors in catholyte. In Control_2, since oxygen can be generated through water electrolysis and can be served as an electron acceptor, the current increased to around 70 μA quickly and then decreased slowly (see supplementary material). In Control_3, the electron acceptor was supplied by air flushing (5 mL/min) rather than water splitting. The current showed a similar trend with the Control_2 experiment (see supplementary material). The results indicated that a sufficient supply of oxygen (derived from the air or water electrolysis) was necessary for the current generation in MFC mode. During the operation period at all conditions, the pH of the anolyte and catholyte was relatively stable (Fig. 2B). In all the control experiments, ammonium migration from anolyte to catholyte was observed (Fig. 2C and D). The ammonium removal rates in anolyte were around 30.79 mg N/(m2·h) and the ammonium accumulation rates in catholyte were 18.07 ∼ 22.15 mg N/(m2·h). The difference was attributed to the consumption by microorganisms in the anode chamber. In Control_2, about 1.49 mg N was consumed by microorganisms in the anode chamber. In Control_3, this value increased to 2.27 mg N. The results indicated that the system operated in MFC mode could provide the necessary nitrogen for SCP synthesis."
8,Effect of CO2 amount on the system performances,"3.2 Effect of CO2 amount on the system performances The HBI system was then supplied with different amounts of CO2 in the gas recycling bag, and a linear OD increase was observed (Fig. 3 A). With more CO2 supply (0.25 ∼ 2 L), C. necator 335 could grow for a longer time (increased from 24 h to 60 h). The highest OD660 was 0.48 ± 0.002, 0.66 ± 0.01, and 0.97 ± 0.01 when the supplied CO2 was 0.25, 1 and 2 L, respectively (Fig. 3A). The bacterial growth rate was very close among the different conditions. Ammonium ions could continuously migrate from anolyte to catholyte (Fig. 3B). 63.3 ∼ 76% of nitrogen was removed from the anode chamber. The ammonium removal rates were in the range of 55.26 ∼ 76.72 mg N/(m2·h). In the cathode chamber, still, the ammonium started to accumulate after the bacterium stopped growing. During cultivation, the pH of anolyte remained at around 7.3 while the pH of catholyte firstly declined and then increased at different rates (Fig. 3C). With more amount of CO2 supply, the pH of catholyte decreased to a lower level (6.27 ∼ 6.3), and the subsequent increase rate was slower. The current density of the MFC fluctuated in a relatively broad range (31 ∼ 94 mA/m2) while the current in the water electrolysis process at different conditions was relatively stable (25 ∼ 40 mA) (Fig. 3D). In the present study, the bacterium grew in cathode chamber in a linear fashion and the growth rate was not changed despite the increase of CO2 amount supplied. It was shown that the CO2 flow rate could significantly alter the proliferation of microbes in MET unit (Rojas et al., 2021). The different results obtained here indicated that the gas–liquid transfer of CO2 might not be enhanced only by increasing the initial CO2 amount. Linear growth of HOB had been found in single-chamber water electrolyzer previously (Givirovskiy et al., 2019b). Since the HOB was cultivated with sufficient carbon and nitrogen supply, the growth of HOB was expected to be limited by hydrogen evolution rate. Consequently, the linear production of hydrogen during water electrolysis led to the linear growth of bacteria. Actually, the hydrogen generation rate was affected by changing CO2 amounts (see supplementary material). This might be due to the fact that the more CO2 was supplied, the more CO2 were dissolved in catholyte. In consequence, the conductivity of catholyte was elevated and the water electrolysis was a bit promoted. However, the enhanced hydrogen evolution did not result in faster growth rates. Hence, the main limiting factor of growth may be the slow transfer rate of ammonium ions. It has been reported that in a single chamber water electrolyzer, the hydrogen generation rate was 5.3 × 10-7 kg/h, i. e., 6.5 mL/h, and the specific growth rate was estimated to be 0.14 h−1 (Givirovskiy et al., 2019a). In this study, the determined hydrogen evolution rate was 2.17 mL/h in the control test (without bacteria inoculation) (see supplementary material), and the maximal specific growth rate was 0.098 ± 0.008 h−1. The growth rate was comparable to the reported specific growth rates (0.094 ∼ 0.12 h−1) achieved in autotrophic cultivation of C. necator in a pressured bioreactor under different conditions (Yu and Munasinghe, 2018). Unpleasantly, the water electrolysis efficiency in the current HBI system in 72 h was only 5.23% which is much lower than that obtained by industrial water electrolysis (∼70%) (Msc and de Wilt, 2015). Multiple parameters such as electrode materials, space between electrodes, electrode size and alignment, and electrolyte quality and conductivity could significantly affect the efficiency of water electrolysis (Mazloomi and Sulaiman, 2012). The reported single chamber water electrolyzer employed stainless steel as cathode and titanium coated with iridium oxide as anode. The conductivity of the electrolyte was as high as 12 mS/cm by supplementing 5.5 g/L of sodium sulfate. Therefore, the water electrolyzer had a relatively low overpotential and could be driven with an external power supply of 2.31 V (Givirovskiy et al., 2019b). In the current HBI system, the lower conductivity of electrolyte (7.5 mS/cm) may lead to a higher overpotential. Besides, some side reactions might take place, and thus, lower the efficiency of water splitting. For instance, reactive oxygen species (ROS) (such as H2O2, superoxide, or hydroxyl radical) could be generated in cathode because of its higher thermodynamical favorableness than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at pH neutral environment (Ruuskanen et al., 2021). With the presence of ferric in catholyte, strong oxidant hydroxyl radicals might be generated from H2O2 through electro-Fenton reaction (Yang et al., 2021b). In addition, the continuous decrease of CO2 and H2 even after the bacterial growth stopped (see supplementary material) indicated the possible occurrence of unknown reactions. The sharp decrease of OD (after 36, 48, or 60 h) suggested cell lysis (van Niel et al., 2003). Thus, cells might be damaged by ROS or other unknown compounds generated and release ammonium ions to the catholyte. To alleviate the suppression of bacterial growth, adding ROS quenchers or decomposition enzymes and the adoption of biocompatible cathodic catalysts (e.g., ROS-resistant cobalt-phosphorus alloy cathode) in the system are expected (Liu et al., 2016; Torella et al., 2015). In brief, the water-splitting efficiency must be further improved in the proposed HBI to save energy consumption. The ammonium removal efficiency and rates were lower than the values previously reported from MFCs (Gildemyn et al., 2015; Haddadi et al., 2013; Kuntke et al., 2011). For instance, the ammonium could be concentrated by 6 ∼ 7 times in the cathode chamber in an MFC with a resistor of 1 kΩ in 5 days (Kuntke et al., 2011). Furthermore, current density was proven to impact ammonium recovery significantly (Kuntke et al., 2011). In the previous study, the ammonium concentration in the anode chamber was 4 g N-NH4 +/L, and the current density was as high as 0.3 ∼ 0.9 A/m2. Comparatively, in the current HBI system, the initial ammonium concentration in the anode chamber was only 0.05 g N-NH4 +/L, and the low current density (31 ∼ 94 mA/m2) resulted in a low ammonium recovery performance. Besides, abundant cations (e. g., sodium ions) in anolyte could also compete for the charge with ammonium ions. It should be noted that the proposed HBI system also showed some advantages. For instance, the pH in both chambers could be maintained at a steady level. Thus, no external acids or bases are needed for pH control in the HBI system during operation."
9,The effect of operational modes on the system performances,"3.3 The effect of operational modes on the system performances The system was further investigated at different operating conditions. At first, the MET reactor in the HBI system was operated at MFC mode connecting with different external resistors (1 kΩ and 10 Ω). Furthermore, the MET reactor was changed to MEC mode powered by voltages of 0.2 and 0.5 V. Amongst, C. necator 335 grew slowest when the system was operated at MFC mode connected with 10 Ω resistor. However, the highest OD660 (0.82 ± 0.005) with 10 Ω resistor was close to the highest OD660 obtained with 1kΩ resistor (0.86 ± 0.01) and the one obtained at MEC mode with 0.2 V power supply (0.89 ± 0.01). When the MET was set as MEC mode, and 0.5 V was supplied, the highest OD660 was 0.96 ± 0.01. The stationary phase was not observed, and the OD660 began to decrease rapidly after the OD660 reached the highest level (Fig. 4 A). Compared to MFC mode, the decrease of OD660 was slower at MEC mode and the slowest with a higher power supply (0.5 V). The pH of the anolyte could remain stable at around 7.2 at all conditions, and the pH of cathole shared a similar trend (Fig. 4B). At MEC mode, the pH of catholyte was higher. Ammonium ions moved from anolyte to catholyte at all conditions at close migration rates in the range of 55 ∼ 60 mg N/(m2·h) (Fig. 4C). In catholyte, ammonium accumulated significantly after 60 h at MFC mode indicated ammonium release from bacterial cells, and the cell lysis was severer than that at MEC mode. The current in the MFC mode fluctuated in the range of 40 ∼ 90 μA with a resistance of 1 kΩ (Fig. 4D). Once the resistance was lowered to 10 Ω, the current increased to 80 ∼ 130 μA (Fig. 4D). The current was significantly enhanced at the beginning of the batch run at MEC mode, but the high current could not be kept for an extended period and declined keenly in the first 12 ∼ 18 h. The current fluctuated in the range of 100 ∼ 150 μA and 100 ∼ 200 μA at MEC mode with 0.2 and 0.5 V power supply, respectively. The current in the water electrolysis circuit was not affected much (Fig. 4D). The different operation modes could affect the current density in the MET unit, and the current density might affect the ammonium migration. The current density in an MFC was promoted by 0.9 and 1.8 times when the resistance was lowered from 1 kΩ to 500 Ω and 250 Ω, respectively (Kuntke et al., 2011). The higher current density led to a higher ammonium migration rate while treating wastewater with 4 g N-NH4 +/L (Kuntke et al., 2011). In the present study, the current density in the MET unit was doubled when the resistance was lowered from 1 kΩ to 10 Ω. By changing the MET unit from MFC mode to MEC mode, the current density was further enhanced. However, the current density could not be maintained at high level for a long time (Fig. 4D). Consequently, the ammonium removal rate in the anode chamber was not changed much (Fig. 4C). This may be because the current density in the MET unit was still low (25 ∼ 125 mA/m2) compared with the reported values (313 ∼ 917 mA/m2) (Kuntke et al., 2011). Therefore, to promote the ammonium transportation from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber, the current density has to be further improved by lowering the internal resistance of the MET unit, enriching robust exoelectrogens, and employing advanced electrodes. Besides, the decrease of OD660 seemed to be a bit alleviated at MEC mode with a higher external voltage. The results implied that the generation of toxic factors (e.g. ROS) was slightly mitigated at higher current density in the MET unit. The generation of H2O2 has been found more prevalent at lower potentials at neutral pH, which could support the suspicion (Torella et al., 2015). Nonetheless, the limiting factors for bacterial growth in the cathode and the corresponding strategies need to be clarified in future studies."
10,Test with actual municipal wastewater,"3.4 Test with actual municipal wastewater The influent from a municipal WWTP was fed to the HBI system. The strain C. necator 335 showed a similar growth curve obtained from synthetic wastewater (Fig. 5 A). The highest specific growth rate (μmax) was 0.08 h−1. The highest OD660 observed was 0.97 ± 0.01, and the corresponding CDW production was 0.381 ± 0.009 g/L. The biomass contained 64.79 ± 4.93% of crude protein. The COD of the wastewater in the anode chamber decreased from 275.06 ± 7.5 g/L to 42.35 ± 0.5 g/L after 72 h. The pH of the wastewater declined more (from 8.17 to 7.38) than that observed with synthetic wastewater while the pH of the catholyte showed a similar trend as before (Fig. 5B). The municipal wastewater contained 43.09 ± 0.19 mg N/L, and after 72 h, the total nitrogen concentration was reduced to 10 ± 0.02 mg/L. 76.8% of the nitrogen was removed from the wastewater and then assimilated as MP in the cathode chamber (Fig. 5C). During operation, the current in the MFC unit was in the range of 25 ∼ 55 μA (Fig. 5D), which was lower than the current achieved with synthetic wastewater. In the water electrolysis unit in the cathode, the current was 30 ∼ 40 mA (Fig. 5D) and comparable to the current obtained before. MP could be synthesized in the HBI system while treating actual wastewater; however, the bacterial-specific growth rate was slightly lower than the value achieved with synthetic wastewater. This was due to the lowered production rate of the gaseous substrates from water electrolysis since a lower water splitting efficiency was observed in the cathode chamber. The lower efficiency might be due to erosion of the working electrodes which then did not conduct electron transfer. The ammonium removal rate in the anode chamber was 48.78 mg N/(m2·h) and lower than that from synthetic wastewater. In the MET unit, the transfer of ammonium ions across the membrane was driven by diffusion and charge production (Kuntke et al., 2011). The relatively low current density indicated fewer electrons were produced from actual wastewater and thus affected the ammonium removal rate. Though the MET unit exhibited a high COD removal (84.6%), the actual wastewater contained fewer COD (275 mg/L) compared with synthetic wastewater (theoretically 780 mg COD/L supplied by acetate) and might present in complicated forms. Hence, fewer substrates were available to exoelectrogens in the real wastewater, resulting in a lower current density. Moreover, the conductivity of the real wastewater (1.17 ± 0.01 mS/cm) was much lower than the artificial wastewater, which might further increase the internal resistance of the MET unit and lower the current density."
11,Implication,"3.5 Implication Nitrogen in wastewater may lead to adverse impacts on ecosystems (e. g., acidification and eutrophication) if they are discharged without treatment to natural water bodies (Camargo and Alonso, 2006). Conventionally, wastewater is treated by WWTPs before discharge and during which reactive nitrogen is removed from the liquid phase through nitrification and denitrification processes (Cruz et al., 2019). However, the nitrogen removal process is energy-intensive, and after treatment, the reactive nitrogen is converted to an inactive form (N2). It was estimated that the energy loss on ammonium removal during denitrification could reach ∼ 11 kWh/kg N (Cruz et al., 2019). Besides the energy loss, N2O with a 200-fold stronger greenhouse effect per molecule than CO2 is commonly emitted from the nitrogen treatment process in WWTPs (Daelman et al., 2015; Kimochi et al., 1998). Since the reactive nitrogen is removed from wastewater other than recovered, in turn, to produce reactive nitrogen for agriculture and industry, 9.1 ∼ 14.2 kWh/kg N-NH4 + is required by the Haber-Bosch process (Zhang et al., 2013). According to a life cycle assessment, recovery of reactive nitrogen (e.g., N-NH4 +) from wastewater would lead to a lower environmental impact than nitrogen removal via the conventional activated sludge process or partial nitritation-anammox process (Cruz et al., 2019). In the pilot-scale power-to-protein system set up in a WWTP in the Netherlands (Oesterholt et al., 2017), MP was produced using the nitrogen recovered from wastewater through air stripping. To heighten the ammonium recovery rate, electricity consumption may be considerable for heating and gas stripping, especially when the ammonium concentration is low. Oesterholt et al. estimated that the cost of striping accounted for 16.8% to 30.8% of the total cost and was decisive to the economic feasibility of the whole process. Different from stripping, ammonium recovery is powered by the electrons harvested from wastewater by exoelectrogens and free diffusion in the proposed HBI system. Therefore, no external energy is needed for driving ammonium recovery. After that, the recovered nitrogen is in-situ upgraded to MP in the cathode chamber. Corrosive chemicals (alkalies and acids) are also demanded in the stripping process for the conversion of dissolved ammonium ions to volatile ammonia and the subsequent absorption. The storage, transportation, and operation of strongly corrosive chemicals are dangerous, costly, and undesired. Comparatively, ammonium recovery through METs could significantly reduce the consumption of acids/bases. In the two-chamber MFC, the pH in the anode chamber tends to decrease because of the generation of protons from organics oxidization, while the pH in the cathode chamber tends to increase because of the consumption of protons. However, the inconsistency could be partially mitigated by migrating cations (e.g. protons and ammonium ions) from anode to cathode through CEM. In the current study, the pH in the anode chamber decreased from 8.2 to 7.4 in 72 h, which was still suitable for the growth of exoelectrogens (Sun et al., 2014). Besides, the decrease of pH could be mitigated by refreshing the anolyte in continuous flow mode with a proper hydraulic retention time (HRT). In the cathode chamber, the pH firstly decreased as the fast dissolution of CO2 and then increased slowly. Therefore, the increase of catholyte pH in the MET unit can be controlled by the flushing rate of CO2. In addition, the assimilation of ammonium by HOB can also decrease the solution pH (Yang et al., 2021a). In total, acids/bases consumption for pH adjustment which is generally required by conventional air stripping process for ammonium recovery could be minimized or even avoided in the proposed HBI system. The simultaneous removal of ammonium and COD from wastewater could significantly decrease wastewater treatment costs and prevent greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions. For MP biosynthesis, the carbon source (CO2) can be derived from raw biogas and industrial off-gas, H2 and O2 produced via water electrolysis can be driven by green electricity (e. g., wind or solar power). The process thus has an extremely low environmental footprint. Though promising, the system also showed some deficiencies which need to be addressed in future research. For instance, the MET unit exhibited a relatively low energy efficiency and affected ammonium removal. Some waste streams (e. g., potato juice wastewater and high-ammonia–nitrogen wastewater) (Dou et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2021) contain more ammonium and carbon substrates (e. g., sugars, and short-chain fatty acids). The biodegradable substrates could be mixed with municipal wastewater to enhance ammonium migration and promote energy efficiency via increasing ammonium concentration gradient, the conductivity of the anolyte, and the activity of exoelectrogens. Hydrogen evolution efficiency is another limiting factor of MP synthesis. Electrode materials, structure, distance, and surface catalysis could significantly affect the efficiency of water electrolysis and energy cost (Liu et al., 2019). Gas mass transfer in the cathode chamber can affect the growth of HOB, and the electrode over-potential (Liu et al., 2019) therefore needs to be enhanced. Moreover, some ROS may be produced in the cathode chamber and lead to bacterial cells damage. Therefore, biocompatible ROS-resistant electrodes, e. g., cobalt-phosphorous (CoP) alloy cathode, can be used in the HBI system to alleviate the ROS generation and promote H2 evolution (Liu et al., 2016). Besides, the durability of electrodes is worthy of note because the electrodes are prone to corrosion since the catholyte contains complex components and high dissolved oxygen (Ruuskanen et al., 2021). ROS-resistant HOB strains are possibly isolated or acclimatized since some strains may have a higher antioxidant activity (Nyyssölä et al., 2021)."
12,Conclusion,"For the first time, this study realized self-sustained ammonium recovery and in-situ upcycling for MP production in an integrated HBI system. Linear accumulation of biomass was obtained and the growth rate was not significantly affected by the fluctuation of CO2 supply or the different operation modes (MFC/MEC). Though MP was successfully synthesized in the system using the recovered ammonium from wastewater, the limiting factors for bacterial growth in the system need to be further clarified. Because of the low environmental footprint during MP production, further optimization and scaling-up investigation are expected in the future study."
