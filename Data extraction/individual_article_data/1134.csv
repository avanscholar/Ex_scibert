0,Introduction,"The energy demand is expected to increase significantly worldwide by 2030 due to the accelerated population growth. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop clean energy systems to meet the increasing world energy consumption and simultaneously reduce the fossil fuels dependence and the negative environmental impact of their use [1,2]. Renewable hydrogen as an energy vector has been regarded as a sound alternative to the use of fossil fuel due to its environmental friendliness and high energy content [3]. Nowadays, H2 is mainly produced by steam reforming of natural gas, coal or crude oil. Other technologies for producing hydrogen include electrolysis, reforming of biofuels and photocatalysis. Among them, photocatalytic hydrogen production from water, using solar radiation as energy source, is one of the most promising technologies. A large number of photocatalytic materials have been studied for water splitting since the seminal work of Fujishima and Honda [4], showing great potential for solar energy conversion, including the production of hydrogen. The irradiation of a suspension of a semiconductor oxide presents attracting features but also stringent requirements regarding materials properties, which include tailoring of the electronic structure: band gap - essential for the absorption of solar energy, and flat band potential - higher than the redox potential of the couple H+/H2. Furthermore, efficient charge transport is necessary, as well as effective charge separation and prevention of electron-hole pair recombination, before the redox reactions can proceed at the semiconductor surface [1,2,5]. It is emphasized that the mentioned reaction steps have very different time scales: femtoseconds for the generation of an electron-hole couple, while their recombination occurs in 10–100 ns. In a comparative time scale are the oxidation reactions which also take about 100 ns. The reduction reactions need times of the order of ms [6]. One of the used strategies is the trapping of generated electrons by depositing an adequate work function metal on the semiconductor. In this way, the created Schottky barrier [7] at the metal/semiconductor interface can operate as an efficient electron trap and so increase the efficiency of the process. Another strategy includes making holes react with a suitable hole scavenger [8,9]. TiO2 is the most widely used photocatalyst because of its strong oxidation power, chemical inertness, non-toxicity and low-cost [10]. However, despite these advantages, bare TiO2 has low efficiency as a photocatalyst for H2 production. This is mainly because photogenerated electrons and holes undergo fast charge recombination which leads to low rates of the desired redox chemical transformations [11]. In the past decade, various strategies such as heterostructuring, crystal/textural modifications and band gap engineering, have been applied to enhance the photocatalytic activity of titania for organic pollutants degradation, heavy metal cations reduction and energy conversion. Recent developments include metal and non-metal modified TiO2, semiconductors coupling and ternary TiO2 photocatalysts [9,12–20]. Regarding metal nanoparticle deposition, platinum is generally employed as co-catalyst due to the high value of its work function, allowing the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons [21]. As stated, photocatalytic H2 evolution can also be optimized using sacrificial agents which may act as hole scavengers, removing selectively photoexcited holes and improving the charge separation efficiency. Recent studies promote the use of residual waters containing short chain alcohols as sacrificial agents, integrating hydrogen production with valorization of waste. Alcohols are generally the sacrificial agents chosen to use with TiO2 based photocatalysts [22] and among them, methanol has been the most widely employed in photocatalytic hydrogen production studies since it is considered the best electron donor, has a simple structure and shows high hydrogen production rates [1]. Ethanol is also widely investigated with the advantage of being less toxic than methanol and present in a large number of industrial waste waters. Glycerol-rich wastes are suggested to be used in photocatalytic hydrogen production as a potential solution to deal with the large amounts of glycerol generated as a by-product of biodiesel production [23,24]. Some recent studies report the importance of the role of the sacrificial agents on the water splitting process, suggesting that hydrogen production can be maximized by the right choice of catalyst and sacrificial agents [25,26]. It has also been shown that the composites of TiO2 with carbon materials exhibit better photocatalyst performance than TiO2 itself. Among carbon materials, graphene oxide (GO) has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years as a promising material for the design of efficient photocatalysts [27–31]. This is due to its ability to avoid the electron hole recombination. The incorporation of GO as co-catalyst in TiO2/Pt photocatalysts also aims at reducing the platinum loading and the total cost of the catalyst, while enhancing the photocatalyst properties. In this work, a series of ternary TiO2-rGO-Pt photocatalysts were used to produce hydrogen from solutions containing ethanol as sacrificial agent. The effect of several key operating parameters including concentration of sacrificial agent, catalyst loading, wt% of GO, wt% of Pt and pH were evaluated. With the most efficient photocatalyst, TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8%, and optimized operating parameters, the obtained initial hydrogen generation rates are within the highest in the literature. Moreover, results of implemented tests in the gas phase, thought to contribute to better understand the reaction mechanism, are also discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade, being used without further purification. Graphene oxide (GO) was supplied by Nanoinnova. TiO2 P25 was obtained from Evonik Industries and hexachloroplatinic acid from Panreac."
3,Synthesis of photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts Reduced graphene oxide TiO2 nanocomposites (TiO2-rGO(x), x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wt%) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure GO (30–150 mg) was dispersed by ultrasonication in a solution of ethanol/water (90/30 mL) for 1 h. Then TiO2 P25 (3 g) was added, and the mixture was subjected to cycles of stirring and ultrasonication for 2 h, 30 min for each step. This mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-sealed stainless steel Parr reactor (300 mL) and stirred at 125 °C for 4 h to simultaneously reduce GO and deposit TiO2 on the carbon substrate [32]. The product was recovered by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol and dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight (Scheme 1 ). Photocatalysts TiO2-rGO(x)-Pt(y) (x = 0−5 wt%; y = 1.5, 2.5, 3.8 wt%) were obtained by platinum decoration of the TiO2-rGO(x) nanocomposites using a photodeposition method [33]. First, the TiO2-rGO(x) nanocomposite (2 g) was dispersed in 750 mL of a 10% (v/v) methanol aqueous solution by ultrasonication. Then, the suspension was transferred to a 1 L photochemical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a double quartz immersion well and the appropriate amount of hexachloroplatinic acid (80, 133, 200 mg) added. The mixture was purged with N2 for 15 min and then subjected to UV irradiation, for 3 h, using a 450 W mercury-vapor lamp, at room temperature (Scheme 1). The photocatalysts were isolated by the procedure already described above for TiO2-rGO composites. For comparison the photocatalysts without reduced graphene oxide were also prepared, by the same procedure using TiO2 P25 as base material."
4,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.3 Photocatalyst characterization Materials surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Philips XL30 FEG-SEM. Semi-quantitative elemental composition was obtained with an associated EDS system equipped with a Si(Li) detector with a 3 mm super ultra-thin window (SUTW). A Hitachi H8100 LaB6 gun 200 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used for observation of the nanocomposite. The specimens were prepared by dispersing the catalyst powder in ethanol by ultrasonication for 15 min. A droplet of the suspension was deposited on a 300 mesh copper grid which was left to dry at room temperature. Particle size was estimated from TEM images using the ImageJ processing software. X-ray diffraction of the samples was conducted using a Philips diffractometer and Cu-Kα radiation. The catalyst crystallite size was estimated from the (220) platinum peak width (Scherrer's equation). XPS spectra were recorded using a SPECS NAP-XPS system incorporating the DeviSim NAP reaction cell. The spectrometer is equipped with an Al Kα monochromated source (hν = 1486.6 eV), composed of a SPECS XR50 MF x-ray gun and a μ-FOCUS 600 monochromator, and PHOIBOS 150 NAP 1D-DLD analyzer. X-ray gun power was set to 25 W (1.68 mA emission current and 15 kV) with a 300 μm2 x-ray spot. The survey scans were acquired using 30 eV pass energy, 1 eV step size and 10 s (500 ms x 20 scans) dwell times. All high resolution spectra were acquired using 10 eV pass energy, 0.1 eV step size and 75 s (1 s x 75 scans) dwell times. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra were collected on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer using PerkinElmer UV WinLab 4 software in the spectral range of 250–800 nm. ICP-OES analysis were performed on a Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 DV at CACTI, Vigo University. The electrochemical characterization of the photocatalyst was performed by cyclic voltammetry using a PAR potentiostat model 273. A cell with a three electrode configuration was used with two platinum rods, at an equidistance of the working electrode, as auxiliary electrode and a commercial Ag/AgClsat electrode as reference. The working electrodes were prepared by depositing 20 μL of a catalyst ink on glassy carbon rods, with an exposed area of 0.4 cm2, and drying at 50 °C for 1 h. The typical procedure to prepare the ink consisted of dispersing, by sonication for 30 min, 5 mg of the catalyst powder in a mixture containing 5 μL of a 5 wt% Nafion ethanol solution and 250 μL of isopropanol. Before the experiments performed to determine any electrochemical parameter, the catalysts were always activated by repeated potential cycling, for 30 cycles, from -0.2 to 1.4 VAg/AgClsat, at 0.050 V s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, saturated with N2. The reactivity of the catalyst regarding the ethanol oxidation reaction was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in a solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M ethanol, saturated with nitrogen, for 900 cycles at 0.050 V s−1. Reactivity of the catalyst regarding acetaldehyde was done in similar conditions."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in liquid phase,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in liquid phase The photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in liquid phase were performed in a 250 mL photochemical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a double quartz immersion well using as light source the 450 W mercury-vapor lamp, with an irradiance of 24 mW cm−2. In a typical experiment 125 mg of the photocatalyst was suspended in 250 mL of an ethanol aqueous solution (2.5, 5 or 10 M) and the pH adjusted with HCl 0.1 M or NaOH 0.1 M to a specific value (4, 7, 11). Then, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 15 min, transferred to the reactor and heated to 40 °C. Prior to irradiation the system was purged with N2 for 15 min. The hydrogen produced was collected and measured using an inverted burette system. At the end of the experiment the solution pH value was measured, and the produced gas was analysed by GC chromatography using a Micro GC 3000 from Agilent, equipped with a TCD detector. A molecular Sieve 5A, 10 m x0.32 mm column with a Plot U 3 m x0.32 mm pre-column was used for analysis of H2, CO and CH4 with argon as carrier gas. A Plot U 8 m x0.32 mm column with Plot Q 1 m x0.32 mm as pre-column that can quantify CO2 and other hydrocarbons was employed with helium as carrier gas. An aliquot of the reactional mixture at the end of the experiment was centrifuged and the supernatant analysed by gas chromatography using a GC Hewlett Packard 5890 equipped with a VARIAN CARBOPACK B 60–80 mesh - 4% CARBOWAX 20 M column."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in gas phase,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in gas phase Gas-phase H2 photo-production experiments were conducted in continuous-flow mode. ca. 5 mg of the powdered catalysts were deposited on glass microfiber filters that were placed in a stainless steel reactor of 10.8 cm3 volume, provided with a borosilicate glass window for external irradiation by 2 fluorescent UV lamps (Philips Actinic, λmax=365 nm) of 6 W each, with an irradiance of 3.6 mW cm−2 (λ < 400 nm). The reactor was fed by an Ar flow (20 cm3 min-1) that was passed through a bubbler containing an aqueous ethanol 10 vol.% solution kept at 60 °C. The reactor was maintained at the same temperature throughout the experiment. Hydrogen evolution was monitored by in-line mass spectrometry. The experimental set-up for these photoactivity measurements is represented in Scheme 2 . All photocatalytic tests were carried out along three cycles of 30 min of irradiation time."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization The TiO2-rGO(x)-Pt(y) photocatalysts (x = 0−5 wt%; y = 1.5, 2.5, 3.8 wt%) were prepared by a simple two-step process as depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis procedures are described in detail in section 2. Characterization of the new photocatalysts was made by X-Ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, UV–vis diffuse reflectance, XPS and ICP-OES analysis. XRD patterns for TiO2, GO, TiO2-rGO3%, TiO2-Pt3.8% and TiO2-/rGO3%-Pt3.8% catalysts were obtained. Figure S1 (supplementary information) shows X-Ray diffraction data indicating, as expected, the presence of anatase and rutile phases for the binary and ternary photocatalysts as well as for TiO2. Diffraction peaks corresponding to standard patterns for Pt (JCPDS 65-2868) were observed for the TiO2-Pt3.8% and TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% samples, confirming the photodeposition of platinum. The percentage of anatase and rutile was estimated using Eq. (1), taking into account the area of the main peaks for anatase (A) and rutile (R) phases at 2Ө 25.3° and 27.5°, respectively. Results indicated the usual ∼80% anatase percentage of TiO2 P25 [34]. (1) % R u t i l e = 1 ⌊ ( A R ) × 0.884 + 1 ⌋ × 100 Line broadening analysis was applied in order to obtain the particle size (L) of the powders using Scherrer Eq. (2), where λ is the wavelength of incident X-ray and Ө is the diffraction angle corresponding to the most intense peak. K is the shape factor, a value of 0.94 was taken in this case. Results indicated ∼22 nm crystallite size for anatase TiO2, as expected [34]. (2) L = K λ B c o s θ Micrographs of SEM and elemental analysis by EDS data for the series TiO2-rGO3%, TiO2-Pt3.8%, TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% are presented in Figure S2 (supplementary information). In all cases a globular morphology is observed due to TiO2 with aggregates of the order of 30 nm. The average Pt contents were found compliant with the nominal wt% introduced in the synthesis procedure. The platinum loadings of photocatalyst were also determined by ICP-OES analysis and obtained values are presented in Table 1 . Values are in good agreement with nominal ones and also those indicated by EDS. In Fig. 1 the TEM image for TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8 and TiO2-Pt3.8% clearly shows the deposition of homogeneously distributed Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 which particle size is in agreement with X-Ray data. Pt nanoparticles exhibited an average size of ca. 3.5 nm in both samples according to the histograms included in Fig. 1. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was employed to estimate the band gap of the photocatalysts. Fig. 2 shows the Tauc plots ([(F(R)hν)]2 versus hν) for TiO2-P25 and TiO2-rGO3%, where the value of the exponent in the Tauc equation denotes the nature of the electronic transition in indirect semiconductors. The optical band gap values were obtained by extrapolating the linear region of the Tauc plot and the low-energy baseline and determining the intersection point [35]. Values indicate no modification of the semiconductor band gap beyond the inherent calculation error with the introduction of rGO, once the increased absorption in the visible range due to the graphene component is corrected by the baseline as could be expected from the soft synthesis method [36]. Further modification with platinum (not shown) causes an even larger increase of the low-energy baseline, rendering the Tauc calculation difficult, though again no electronic modifications should be expected from photodeposition of Pt nanoparticles [37]. XPS spectra were recorded to gain insight into the surface chemistry of the catalysts. The Ti 2p regions of the different samples (not shown) do not show any difference upon RGO and Pt incorporation. The top panel of Fig. 3 shows the XPS of samples TiO2-Pt3.8% and TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% in the Pt 4f region. Spectra of both samples can be fitted with a single pair of components centered at 71.2 eV and 74.6 eV (accounting for Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4fd3/2) with strong asymmetry, characteristic of Pt 4f in metallic Pt [38]. We also took the XPS in the valence band region of each sample (see Fig. 4 ). Strong metallic states can be seen in the valence band region of the spectra of samples containing Pt, i. e. large spectral intensity at the Fermi level which corresponds to valence electronic states form Pt: Pt 5d and Pt 6 s. In line with the UV–vis observations, the in-gap electronic states associated with the incorporation of graphene cannot be observed in the spectra in the valence band region. This can be also related to the relatively low cross-section for C valence states (C 2 s and C 2p) [39]. Chemical analysis form the photoemission spectra of Pt-loaded sample indicate that Pt:Ti surface ratio in TiO2-Pt3.8% and TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% is the same within the error, around 3:100, which indicates that the procedure for Pt deposition is reproducible. Spectra of these Pt-loaded samples in the O 1s region have also a similar prolife, featuring a strong component due to lattice oxygen in TiO2 beside high BE components associated with hydroxyl groups (blue curve in the fit) and oxidised C (red curve in the fit). Quantitative chemical analyses also indicate that both Pt-loaded samples have a similar proportion of adsorbed hydroxyl and carbonate. Based on the surface chemistry analysis, we can assume that the difference in the photocatalytic behavior described later in the paper, is not due to differences in Pt loading nor water/CO2 chemisorption capacities. Fig. 3 also shows the C 1s region for all samples, which is dominated by adventitious carbon. However, there is a small component centred at 284.5 eV in samples TiO2-rGO3% and TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8%, well within the range associated with graphitic C sp2 [40]. We therefore assigned this contribution to the presence of graphene on the surface of these two samples."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in liquid phase,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in liquid phase The activity of the new photocatalysts was evaluated for hydrogen production from ethanol/water solutions, using UV irradiation. Different sets of experiments were performed in order to study the effect of ethanol and catalyst concentrations, solution pH, and rGO and platinum photocatalyst content on the photocatalytic production of hydrogen. The effect of temperature is not significant and as mentioned in section 2.4 experiments were conducted at 40 °C. Experiments in the absence of light did not generate hydrogen. In fact, on ongoing experiments gas production stops immediately after the UV lamp is switched OFF. The first assays aimed at establishing the ethanol concentration to be used in this work. In this way, experiments were performed using the photocatalyst TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% and an ethanol concentration that varied between 2.5 and 10 M, with solution pH adjusted to a value of 7. Typical obtained results presented as evolved gas volume vs UV irradiation time, at 40 °C, are shown in Fig. 5 . The data show that, at the end of 6 h irradiation time, the total volume of gas produced is the same for all cases, indicating the same average hydrogen production rate for all concentrations of the sacrificial agent used. So, it is considered that in the range of used concentrations, the sacrificial agent is always in excess. Furthermore, the plot exhibits two slopes (Zone I and II), indicating a change in the gas production rate, which can be ascribed to a possible catalyst poisoning effect due to adsorbed intermediates of ethanol oxidation. A concentration of 5 M ethanol was chosen for further studies since it presented the highest initial rate. The effect of the photocatalyst concentration (Fig. 6 ) in the reaction mixture was also studied. After 6 h irradiation, the maximum gas production was obtained with the highest catalyst concentration used, 1 gL−1. This result is in accordance with the indication that the poisoning of the catalyst is a key factor in the process efficiency. It is evident in Fig. 6 that the first slope value and its extension increase with increasing concentration of the catalyst, maintaining higher gas production rates for longer times. The second slope is observed to be much slower having roughly the same value, irrespective of concentration, appearing as a parallel line for all catalyst concentrations used. Fig. 6 inset shows the normalized rates of gas production (mmol h−1 g−1) for various catalyst concentrations, indicating higher initial rates for the smaller catalyst concentrations. For catalyst concentrations lower than 0.25 gL−1 (not shown), gas production normalized rates are even higher, initially (first slope), following the indicated tendency, but decayed to low values of the order of those of the second slope. A loading of 0.5 gL−1 was chosen for further experiments, since it represents a medium range concentration within those used in this work producing high enough rates and which also corresponds to the on-set of the plateau observed in the gas production rates of the second slope in Fig. 6, and taken, for the set-up used in this work, as the optimal catalyst concentration. The effect of the rGO content in the photocatalyst on hydrogen production from water using ethanol as sacrificial agent was evaluated. Photocatalysts with rGO ranging from 0 to 5% and a fixed amount of Pt of 3.8%, at pH 7 were used. The evolved gas volume vs UV irradiation time curves (Fig. 7 ) follow the same trend for all percentages of rGO in the photocatalysts, exhibiting two slopes, as observed before, which indicates that the poisoning of the photocatalyts occurs in every case and does not depend on the quantity of rGO incorporated. On the other hand, the rGO content clearly influences the gas production rate values, particularly in Zone I (first slope), see inset Fig. 7. Deactivation of the catalyst occurs leading to a considerable loss of activity since second slope rates in most cases amount only to little more than 10% of the values observed in the zone of the first slope. The results obtained for gas production related to the first slope show an increase from 348 mmol h−1 g-1 to a maximum value of 567 mmol h−1 g-1, when rGO amount increases from 0 to 3%. A decrease in the rate is observed for higher rGO content. The gas production rate corresponding to the second slope of the curves follows the same trend as the first slope, with much lower values, but the effect is less pronounced. The incorporation of rGO improves the hydrogen generation probably due to its electron acceptor and transferring capability and inhibition of the recombination of photo-excited electrons and holes. The rate decrease observed for contents higher than 3% can be attributed to a higher absorption of radiation by rGO and consequently a lesser absorption by TiO2 [31]. This seems to be in agreement with the literature where in many cases the hydrogen production rates obtained with several rGO-TiO2-metal in different water splitting systems increase with the increase of the rGO loading in the photocatalyst reaching the highest values for 2–5% rGO [41,42]. The effect of solution pH was studied for the most efficient photocatalyst, TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% and the best results were obtained for pH 7 (Fig. 8 ). This could be related to the surface activity of GO which seems to vary with different solution pH values according to the degree of protonation of oxygen groups attached to graphene and consequent variations in hydrophilicity [43,44]. The variation of pH with time during the gas production with photocatalyst TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% was also evaluated. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 7 before addition to the reactor (Fig. 9 ). It was observed that the pH decreases rapidly to a value around 3.5 and then stabilizes which is in accordance with the possible photocatalytic reactions occurring: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O ⟶ Ti O 2 2C O 2 + 6 H 2 (2) e−(Me) + H+ sol → Hads (3) H2ads → H2 gas (4) 2h + C2H5OH → 2H+ + CH3CHO (5) 2h + CH3CHO + H2O → 2H+ + CH3COOH where Me - Metal (Pt); h - hole In order to evaluate if the decrease of the gas production rate is directly related with the decrease of pH, another assay was performed in which the pH was maintained above 6 by regular additions of a NaOH solution. The curve gas volume vs UV irradiation time obtained was similar to the one showed in Fig. 8, which indicates that the pH lowering is not the main cause for the hydrogen rate decrease. This rate decrease is probably due to the poisoning of the photocatalysts by the reactions products, namely, acetaldehyde (see below). When using methanol as sacrificial agent the photocatalysts was reported to be deactivated by the formation of formic acid as oxidation product [45]. The effect of platinum loading on the activity of the photocatalyts was also tested with three TiO2-rGO3% photocatalysts having platinum contents of 1.5, 2.5 and 3.8%. The rate values obtained for slope 1 were 361, 356, 567 mmol h−1 g−1 and for the second slope, 24, 34, 66 mmol h−1 g−1 with TiO2-rGO3%-Pt1.5%, TiO2-rGO3%-Pt2.5%, TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8%, respectively. After 6 h of UV irradiation the volume of gas produced with TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% was approximately three times higher than the volume obtained with TiO2-rGO3%-Pt1.5%. Thus, it is clear that the production of gas increases with the platinum loading. Nevertheless, and since the high cost of platinum and its increasing scarcity worldwide are the major drawbacks for the practical application of these photocatalysts, the reduction of the platinum loadings, or its replacement with non-precious metals, will be one of our main objective in future studies. Regarding rates, Table S1 (supplementary information) compares photocatalytic gas production rates in the open literature with values obtained in this work. The gas produced at the end of each assay was analyzed by gas chromatography to determine its composition. The results showed that the main product, when analyzing the gas phase, is hydrogen. Its content is above 95% and the remaining gas components are CH4, CO, CO2, C2H6 and C2H4. Since the rates for hydrogen production vary significantly in the zone of the first slope (Zone I) and second slope (Zone II), different experiments were conducted in order to collect gases in those zones and also in an intermediate zone (Zone I/II). Results are presented in Fig. 10 indicating increasing amounts of CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 in Zone II. At the end of each experiment the liquid phase was also analyzed by gas chromatography. Besides ethanol, only acetaldehyde was detected. According to the obtained data no complete photoreforming reaction takes place with the photocatalyst in the liquid phase. The reaction is characterized by having very little CO2 formation and acetaldehyde as the product of ethanol dehydrogenation. The overall photoreforming process, instead, allows the production of 6 molecules of H2 and 2 of CO2 per one of ethanol. Experiments in the liquid phase replacing ethanol for acetaldehyde in a concentration of 5 M and in the same experimental conditions as for ethanol were conducted. Results indicate that after about one hour of exposure only ∼50 mLh-1 of hydrogen have been produced at a rate of ∼16 mmol h−1 g−1, representing less than 3% of the gas initially produced when using ethanol. Moreover, after one hour of exposure to irradiation the gas production stopped completely, as evident in Fig. 11 . The catalyst poisoning effect of reaction intermediaries and activity loss with cycling is evidenced by the voltammetry profile of TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% conducted in acid ethanol solutions. Fig. 12 shows current densities in the potential domain of ethanol oxidation where it is possible to observe the gradual poisoning of the catalyst by the reduction of current density of peaks at 0.68 V and 1.06 V. As shown 900 cycles were conducted at the end of which both oxidation peaks disappeared. Voltammetry in an acetaldehyde solution was run in similar experimental conditions did not display any redox peaks and current densities were lower than those obtained with ethanol at 900 cycles. To assess the photocatalyst stability, the same sample was tested upon irradiation 3 times in 3 different cycles of 6 h each. Repetitive cycles were conducted after recovering the catalyst from the solution by centrifugation and drying at 60 °C. Results regarding the produced gas volume over time are presented in Fig. 13 a). A drastic decrease in the rate of gas production was observed from cycle to cycle that could indicate catalyst deactivation due to poisoning of Pt from adsorbed intermediaries from the oxidation of ethanol. Additionally, TEM analysis of the spent photocatalyst, Fig. 13b), shows agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles also suggesting a reduction of catalyst surface area. Fig. 13a) includes also, produced gas volume for catalyst after heat treatment of the reused sample after cycle 1, to eliminate adsorbed intermediaries. A TEM picture of the powder after heat treatment is also shown in Fig. 13c). The main gas-phase product of the photocatalytic reforming in 5 M ethanol solutions in liquid for catalyst TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% is H2, but CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, were also accounted for in very small amounts. Acetaldehyde is identified as intermediate product in the liquid phase (reaction 4). In this work the very high H2/COx ratios obtained in Zone I and Zone II, according to data in Figs. 5–8, exceed by far the stoichiometric value of H2/CO2 = 3 given in reaction (1), indicating incomplete photoreforming of ethanol. Full dehydrogenation of ethanol to CO2 is not favored probably due to the poor adsorption of acetaldehyde. The presence of partially oxidized intermediates seems to be related to the decrease in the H2 production rate over the reaction time which was observed during during activity tests using ethanol (loss of activity with cycling (Figs. 12,13) and acetaldehyde (Fig. 11). Moreover, authors account for CH4 and CO as a result of the decomposition of acetaldehyde(aq) along with some ethanol reduction reactions yielding traces of CH4, C2H4, C2H6, confirmed by mechanistic studies [47]."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in gas phase,"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in gas phase Photocatalytic hydrogen production studies in gas phase were performed with the TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8%, TiO2-Pt3.8% and TiO2-rGO3% photocatalysts. The experimental set-up for these photoactivity measurements is represented in Scheme 2. Fig. 14 shows the hydrogen evolution rates obtained in the gas-phase H2O + ethanol reaction along 3 light-on – light-off cycles. Pristine P25 did not lead to the formation of hydrogen. In the presence of rGO, the activity of TiO2 is promoted and does not decline during and between cycles, revealing the absence of deactivation and/or degradation of the rGO in these reaction conditions. The inclusion of platinum nanoparticles improves the activity of TiO2 by a factor of ca. 15 with respect to the inclusion of graphene, as could be expected considering the good hydrogen evolution catalytic properties of Pt, but, as in the case of the liquid phase reaction, some deactivation takes place and the activity of the catalyst decreases ca. 15%. However, the ternary system TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% gives rise to a considerable increase (> 1.5 times) of hydrogen production even with respect to the TiO2-Pt3.8% system, revealing an interesting synergistic effect between Pt and rGO with TiO2. Furthermore, as already suggested by the trend of activity with time of the TiO2-rGO3% system, the concourse of graphene reduces notably the deactivation with respect to the TiO2-Pt3.8% catalyst, with an activity decline of only 8% in the ternary system. Table S2 (supplementary information) compares photocatalytic gas production rates in the open literature with values obtained in this work. The effect of temperature is not very significant. A blank test without light and with an increase in temperature from room to the reaction temperature (60 °C) reveals that temperature exerts an effect equivalent to less than 5% of the hydrogen evolution rate obtained under irradiation. Fig. 15 shows the CO2 evolution rates with the three catalysts, followed by means of the signal at m/z = 44. It has to be noted though that this signal would also correspond to acetaldehyde, a common ethanol oxidation product [46], that is therefore not distinguishable from CO2. Indeed, a mechanism in which ethanol is sequentially oxidized into acetaldehyde, acetic acid, CO and CO2 has been proposed on the basis of in-situ DRIFT experiments during gas-phase photoreforming reactions [46], although evolution of methane presumably coming from acetaldehyde decomposition was also detected [47]. In our case, the relative order of production rates of CO2/CH3CHO is the same as that of hydrogen, suggesting that ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde is the first reaction step for all assayed catalysts. The H2/CO2 (CH3CHO) molar ratio is shown in Fig. 16 . Upon starting irradiation, this ratio quickly rises and then tends to a stable value, as can be expected from the higher diffusivity of hydrogen compared to ethanol oxidation products. Some differences arise here among the different catalysts: while the steady value of the TiO2-rGO3% catalyst is close to 1, which would agree with a partial oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, the ones got with TiO2-Pt3.8% and TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8%, close to 3, suggest a total oxidation of ethanol according to a photo-reforming stoichiometry. rGO would therefore increase the activity of TiO2-Pt3.8% without changing the reaction mechanism, which would agree with the graphene component acting as an electron mediator between the TiO2 photocatalyst and the Pt co-catalyst."
11,Conclusions,"• A series of TiO2-reduced graphene oxide-Pt photocatalysts were synthesized by a simple two-step procedure. • TiO2-rGO3%-Pt3.8% is shown to be an active photocatalyst for the production of hydrogen, using ethanol as sacrificial agent, exhibiting very high initial rates both in gas and liquid phase reactions, clearly one of the highest rates in recent literature data. • Variations in the gas production rates in the liquid phase are associated to adsorption of intermediates that cause catalyst poisoning, reducing the hydrogen production rate. • pH variations during hydrogen production measured in the liquid phase studies were striking, this is thought to be due to the formation of acetaldehyde during the reaction, accounting for the lower concentration of CO2 and CH4 found by gas chromatography. Catalysts with rGO exhibit best behaviour. • Partial oxidation of ethanol took place in liquid, with the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and Pt poisoning, while complete photoreforming is indicated to be favoured in the gas phase, with a molar ratio H2/CO2 of 3. rGO reinforces the effect of Pt as a suppressor of charge recombination. • Reuse of the catalyst showed a significant loss of activity from cycle to cycle, in the liquid phase tests. • Preliminary results of the application of thermal or chemical treatments applied to the photocatalyst in order to eliminate adsorbed intermediates with poisoning effect are promising, making possible the catalyst reutilization. Further work is under way, for the optimization of catalyst/experimental conditions, to better understand the reaction kinetics and mechanisms and to identify low-cost metal loading materials with acceptable enhancement for hydrogen production, as well as modified catalysts that allow effective utilization of visible light."
