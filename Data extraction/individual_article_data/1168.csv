0,Introduction,"Biogas generated from the anaerobiosis of various organic wastes can be used as a clean energy source, since it can reduce carbon emissions and be used in the place of carbon fuels to sustain homes, commercial and industrial activities [1]. The biogases generated by anaerobic digestion that are suitable as biofuels are methane and hydrogen. The latter, which has only water as combustion product and an energy yield of 141 kJ.g−1, has the potential to be a sustainable energy resource. Different wastewaters have been used as substrate for hydrogen production [2–4]. However, some substrates can present undesirable features for biological anaerobiosis, such as high organic loads and concentration of volatile acids, toxicity and seasonality. But the addition a co-substrate with complementary characteristics, in a process called anaerobic co-digestion, may solve or at least mitigate these problems [5]. Several researchers have used whey, which is the dairy industry effluent, for biohydrogen production, but due to its high biodegradability, low alkalinity content and high organic load [6–8] it may be hard to stabilize biogas production, since peaks of volatile acids are easily formed and may inhibit the process [9–13]. Hence, using a co-substrate with buffering capacity may be an interesting approach to overcome process instability. Glycerol, which is the effluent from biodiesel industry, may be a good co-substrate for cheese whey digestion. It has a pH suitable for anaerobic processes, buffering capacity and its high C content (36g-C/92g-glycerin) increases the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in the mixture [14]. The co-digestion between whey and glycerin (proportion of 75:25, respectively, on a COD basis) has been successfully used in studies aiming for H2 production [15,16]. Anaerobic processes, as well as other biological systems, are strongly influenced by temperature. There is a consensus of the optimal temperature range for methane production, but there is considerable disagreement about the ideal temperature or even an ideal range for biological hydrogen production temperature. According to Zhang and Shen [17], the best process efficiencies occur in the range between 25 °C and 40 °C, particularly under conditions near the ideal (35 °C) for the function of the biochemical catalysts. Several studies have been conducted and have shown that there is a certain temperature range between 25 °C and 60 °C in which the high capacity of hydrogen producing bacteria to produce this gas through fermentation can be noted. Other studies converge to temperatures between 30 °C and 37 °C as the optimum temperature for anaerobic fermentation systems producing hydrogen [18,19]. In the mesophilic range, hydrogen producing microorganisms are usually dominated by Clostridium species [17–19]. However, there are reported cases of microflora dominated by Ethanoligenens and Megasphaera [15]. Despite the importance of temperature, few studies address the influence of this operating parameter in the production of hydrogen, especially in sequencing batch reactors [9,16,20–23]. Sequencing batch reactors have the advantages of good operational control, flexibility in the feeding mode due to the different periods of interrupted production, and suitability to the different volumes of wastewater available. It is used for biogas generation from relatively small production units when compared to continuous operation, which is more commonly employed. Continuous biogas operation, however, is characterized by higher sludge retention time, high efficiency and volumetric capacity process treatment but have long periods of start-up and are unsuitable for wastewaters with low organic load [12,24–26]. Thus, the experimental protocol of this paper was designed to study the temperature effect in the mesophilic range (20, 25, 30 and 35 °C) on hydrogen production in an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor with recirculation of the liquid phase (AnSBBR) that co-digested cheese whey (dairy effluent) and glycerin (biodiesel production effluent). The influence of temperature, micronutrient solution added to the influent and heat shock pretreatment of the inoculum on reactor operating stability, organic matter removal efficiency, conversion factor (between removed organic matter and produced hydrogen), biogas composition and hydrogen productivity were assessed. Also, a kinetic model was evaluated to better understand the biotechnological viability of this system and the activation energies of the acidogenesis reactions, through Arrhenius’ model, were estimated."
1,Material and methods,
2,Biological reactor,"2.1 Biological reactor Fig. 1 presents a diagram of the biological system. The system consisted of a reactor (2.0 L) and a recirculation unit (1.5 L) which comprised a side reservoir and a diaphragm pump (interstitial recirculation velocity was 0.2 cm.s−1, which is approximately 10 L.h−1). The details of the system are given in Lovato et al. [15]. The inert support used for the immobilization of the biomass was low-density polyethylene, which formed a bed porosity of 43%. The inoculum came from an UASB (Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) reactor treating wastewater from a poultry slaughterhouse (total volatile solids and total solids concentrations: 51 and 62 g.L−1, respectively). A heat shock pretreatment was performed to select acidogenic bacteria: 90 °C for 10 min and cooling down in an ice bath to 25 °C [28], except in Assay 2. Inoculum composition is described in Penteado et al. [29]. After the imposed conditions to the system, the dominant microorganisms were phylogenetic affiliated to Ethanoligenens and Megasphaera genera [15]."
3,Wastewater,"2.2 Wastewater The wastewaters (substrates) used for the co-digestion were industrial glycerin (concentration of 1.12 kgCOD.kgGlycerin−1) and whey (concentration of 1.05 kgCOD.kgWhey−1). Glycerin was supplied by a glycerin distillation industry, which purifies the biodiesel coproduct, located in the city of Brotas, São Paulo, Brazil. The dry whey used as a carbon source was composed by carbohydrates (73.1%), proteins (11.2%), total fat (2.0%), calcium (0.4%), sodium (0.7%), other minerals (7.6%) and humidity (5.0%). It was from an industry that dries whey from dairy located in the city of São Lourenço do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The composition of the influent was 75% whey and 25% glycerin. Tap water was used to make the influent with the desired concentration. The wastewater was supplemented with a ratio of 0.02 gNaHCO3.gCOD−1 and this ratio was increased if the effluent pH dropped below 4.5 [30]. The micronutrients solution added in the medium, except in Assay 3, was the same as in Lovato et al. [30]."
4,Physical-chemical analyses,"2.3 Physical-chemical analyses Physical-chemical analyses were performed according to APHA/AWWA/WEF [31], Ripley et al. [32], Dubois et al. Dubois et al. [33] and Bondioli and Bella [34]. All methods are described in Lovato et al. [27]. To restrict biomass growth, and therefore allow hydrogen production stability, the biomass inside the reactor was quantified and “washed” weekly, according to Lima et al. [9] procedure."
5,Stability and performance indicators,"2.4 Stability and performance indicators All of the stability and performance indicators of the system are described in Lima et al. [9]: the organic matter, carbohydrates and glycerin removal efficiencies for the soluble (εF) samples; applied organic loading rate (OLRA), removed organic loading rate (OLRR), molar productivity (MPr), specific molar productivity (SMPr); molar hydrogen yield per applied load (YCOD) and molar hydrogen yield per applied substrate (YS)."
6,Experimental procedure,"2.5 Experimental procedure The experimental protocol was performed by verifying the influence of micronutrients supplementation addition in the influent (adding or not adding micronutrient solution), inoculum heat shock pretreatment (performing this procedure or not) and temperature in the mesophilic range (20, 25, 30 and 35 °C). The organic loading rate was 24 kgCOD.m−3.d-1 in all Assays (influent concentration of approximately 7 gCOD.L-1, cycle length of 3 h and feeding time of 1.5 h, which characterizes the process as sequential fed-batches). Table 1 summarizes the assays performed. The fed-batch reactor used was operated for 108 days (each assay was operated on average for 18 days; so, the reactor performed an average of 144 cycles per assay, which guarantees the stability and reproducibility of the assay). Reactor operation is described in Lovato et al. [15]. At the conclusion of each assay, the complete system was washed along with the inert support by sterilization via autoclave (121 °C for 15 min). This cleaning was performed before the beginning of each new assay, which started with the addition of new inoculum (about 100 mL) to the reactor. This procedure aimed to eliminate the interference of the different conditions imposed to the system."
7,Kinetic model of metabolic pathways,"2.6 Kinetic model of metabolic pathways The kinetic model of metabolic pathways was proposed by Lovato et al. [15] and its thoroughly explained in their paper. Below there is a summary of the model to facilitate the readers’ understanding. Substrate (S, which is considered the combination of glycerin and lactose – the main carbohydrate in whey) is converted to acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), butyric acid (HBu), valeric acid (HVa) and ethanol (EtOH) (Eqs. (1)–(5)). In the next three in series steps (Eqs. (6)–(8)), there is the consumption of the propionic, butyric and valeric acids to form smaller chain acids and hydrogen (H). In the next two independent steps (Eqs. (9) and (10)), there are the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic routes to produce methane (M) if methanogenesis is not completely inhibited. The last step (Eq. (11)) is the usage of acetate (cell growth) that was adapted considering the study of Hino et al. [35]. It is important to highlight that the proposed model aims to understand the macro metabolic pathways of the system, and not to predict experimental data and scale-up assessment, such as ADM1.

(12)–(19) present the first order reaction rate equations. The apparent kinetic parameter “k” is related to the reaction rate, indicating a relation to the time that is necessary for the concentration (S, HAc, HPr, HBu, HVal, EtOH, H or M) to reach a residual value in accordance with the hypothesis of the kinetic model. Subscripts “1–11” are related to the reactions. Subscripts “S, HAc, HPr, HBu, HVal, EtOH, H and M” are related to the experimental values used to calculate the parameters. Eqs. (12)–(19) were latter added to molar balances of a sequential batch reactor to calculate compound concentration over time.

8,Arrhenius’ model and activation energy estimation,"2.7 Arrhenius’ model and activation energy estimation In many cases, the observed rate of a chemical reaction increases with increasing temperature, but the extent of this increase varies greatly from reaction to reaction [36]. In terms of the velocity equation, the cause of reaction rate variation by temperature is that the velocity constant k varies when temperature is changed. The relation between these two variables, known as the Arrhenius equation, is shown in Eq. (20) [36]. (20) k = A · e - E a R T Where A is called the frequency factor, Ea is the activation energy of the reaction, R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The Arrhenius equation is useful because it expresses the quantitative relationship between temperature, activation energy and velocity constant [36]. Thus, the Arrhenius equation was adjusted to calculated k parameters of the four main biochemical equations of hydrogen production and consumption of the acidogenesis phase (Eqs. (1)–(4)) to estimate their activation energies."
9,Results and discussion,"Figs. 2 and 3 show the experimental data for Assays 1 to 6 regarding organic matter concentration (COM – Fig. 2A), carbohydrates concentration (CC – Fig. 2B), glycerin concentration (CG – Fig. 2C), pH (Fig. 2D), volatile total acids (TVA – Fig. 2E), gas and hydrogen flows (VG and VH2 – Fig. 3A) and gas concentration (CG – Fig. 3B). The data is displayed continuously so the reader can observe the changes from one assay to the other. But it is important to point out that all assays are independent from each other. The reactor, although a discontinuous one, was operated in a continuous mode (characterizing sequential batches). Table 2 summarizes the main results, including performance and stability indicators. Regarding organic matter removal in form of COD (εOMF), all assays achieved a low organic matter removal (18–23%) without statistically significant difference among each other at a 5% level (one-way ANOVA). However, this is an appropriate result for an acidogenic reactor, as there is the consumption of substrates and formation of acids (Table 2) that are not consumed by the process. These results can also be seen comparing the applied volumetric organic load (OLRA), which ranged between 23.6 and 24.4 kgCOD. m−3.d-1 with the removed volumetric organic load parameter (OLRR), which varied between 4.2 and 5.5 kgCOD. m−3.d-1. Therefore, comparisons about COD will no longer be performed. With regard to the pH, it is possible to note a stable pattern in all assays. Influent had a pH value around 7.8 for all assays. The effluent had a minimum pH value of 4.3 in Assay 1 and a maximum value of 4.8 in Assay 5, which represents a small variation. An average pH effluent value of 4.5 showed no potential to inhibit biogas production. However, in Assay 1 the initial pH was 4.2 with a continuous drop until 3.8 and it was observed that in a pH range between 3.8 and 4.2 there was a significant reduction in hydrogen production [15]."
10,Influence of heat shock pretreatment (assays 1 and 2),"3.1 Influence of heat shock pretreatment (assays 1 and 2) Concerning carbohydrates (whey) removal (εCF and Fig. 2B), Assay 1 (where the inoculum received HST) achieved a slightly higher removal efficiency (98%) than Assay 2 (untreated inoculum – 93%). Regarding glycerin removal efficiency (εGF and Fig. 2C), both assays achieved 97%. Nonetheless, removal efficiencies for carbohydrates and glycerin are not significantly different at a 5% level considering Assays 1 and 2 (one-way ANOVA). Total alkalinity (TA) in the influent was 522 mgCaCO3.L−1 in Assay 1 and 908 mgCaCO3.L−1 in Assay 2; this difference is explained by the higher supplemented alkalinity that was performed in Assay 2 in order to prevent the pH drop that occurred in Assay 1. Total alkalinity was consumed throughout the process in both assays (effluent: 196–374 mgCaCO3.L−1), and total volatile acids were generated in the process (influent: 137–214 mgHAc.L−1 and effluent: 1461–2809 mgHAc.L−1). It is possible to observe that the use of untreated inoculum caused a higher formation of acids in comparison to the pretreated inoculum. Regarding the intermediate compounds, production of acids and alcohols varied along both assays. The highest concentration of acetic acid (12.9–34.7 mmol.L−1) occurred in Assay 2, which theoretically is the best route for hydrogen production [37]. However, this Assay did not achieve the best hydrogen productivity. Assay 2 also presented the highest production of propionic acid (5.7–17.7 mmol.L−1) which is detrimental for hydrogen production. The reactor performance regarding biogas production is shown in Fig. 3A–B and Table 2, where it can be seen that significantly higher values for productivities and yields were achieved in Assay 1: 129.0 molH2. m−3.d-1; 55.0 molH2.kgSVT-1.d-1; 5.4 molH2.kgCOD-1 and 1.4 molH2.kgCOD-1. This represents an improvement of at least 100% in all parameters in comparison with Assay 2. Lovato et al. [30], Bravo et al. [38] and Albanez et al. [39] found that inoculum pretreatment does not have an influence on hydrogen production at a 5% level of significance, but they noted a slight improvement in biogas productivity when performing the pretreatment (on average, a 10% higher productivity). A possible explanation for the divergence between Lovato et al. [30], Bravo et al. [38] and Albanez et al. [39] results and this study results is the lower OLRA used by them (17.8 kgCOD. m−3.d-1, 12.9 kgCOD. m−3.d-1, 7.8 kgCOD. m−3.d-1, respectively) which could decreased the impact of this variable. Cisneros-Pérez et al. [40] studied the influence of two inoculum pretreatments (heat shock and cell wash-out) during the operation of EGSB reactors (100 days of operation, the influent was glucose based and the HRT varied from 10 to 4 h). In their study, they concluded that the inoculum pretreatment has a strong initial effect during early stages of fermentation, after which the operating conditions have a greater impact on reactor performance. Luo et al. [41] observed the same behavior in their study. It is important to emphasize that both studies were done in continuous reactors."
11,Influence of micronutrient solution (assays 1 and 3),"3.2 Influence of micronutrient solution (assays 1 and 3) Stable biohydrogen production is notoriously more difficult to achieve than methane production by anaerobic digestion, since, among other things, it requires certain essential micronutrients for bacterial growth and activity. The exploitation of nutrient formulations, i.e. micronutrient solution added to the medium, for mixed microflora is expected to optimize anaerobic hydrogen production from organic wastewater [42]. The influence of the micronutrient solution added to the medium was studied in Assays 1 and 3, also shown in Table 2. Regarding substrates removal, Assay 3 (where no micronutrient solution was added to the medium) achieved worse results than Assay 1: 95 and 89% of whey and glycerin removal efficiencies, respectively. In comparison, Assay 1 achieved 98 and 97% of whey and glycerin removal efficiencies. Nevertheless, samples are not statically different at a 5% significance level. Total alkalinity and total volatile acids in the influent were similar for both assays: 463–522 mgCaCO3.L−1 and 137–147 mgHAc.L−1. Total alkalinity was consumed throughout the process similarly in both assays (effluent: 88–196 mgCaCO3.L−1); but Assay 3 generated an effluent with higher acidification, reaching 2251 mgHAc.L−1. The use of a medium without micronutrient solution, as the use of untreated inoculum, caused a higher formation of acids and a higher concentration of acetic acid (30.4–43.3%) but this did not lead to a higher biohydrogen production. The reactor performance concerning biogas production is shown in Fig. 3A–B and Table 2, where it can be seen once more that significantly higher values for productivities and yields were achieved in Assay 1 (129.0 molH2. m−3.d-1; 55.0 molH2.kgSVT-1.d-1; 5.4 molH2.kgCOD-1 and 1.4 molH2.kgCOD-1) in comparison with Assay 3 (35.3 molH2. m−3.d-1; 12.5 molH2.kgSVT-1.d-1; 1.5 molH2.kgCOD-1 and 0.4 molH2.kgCOD-1). It is also possible to note biomass adaptation to the imposed condition to the system in Assay 1, since hydrogen productivity increased as the reactor performed more cycles. Lin and Lay [42] found that nutrients significantly affect the hydrogen stability of the anaerobic microflora in sewage sludge with magnesium, sodium, zinc and iron being important supplements, which is in agreement with the results of this work. Albanez et al. [39], however, found that the variation in micronutrient supplementation did not significantly alter biogas production and not adding any micronutrient formula resulted in an increase of hydrogen concentration. Their results can be explained by the use of vinasse as substrate for hydrogen production, which already contains a lot of trace elements that influence the anaerobic process."
12,"Influence of temperature (assays 1, 4–6)","3.3 Influence of temperature (assays 1, 4–6) The influence of temperature on the anaerobic process of hydrogen production was studied in Assays 4 (20 °C), 5 (25 °C), 1 (30 °C) and 6 (35 °C), as shown in Table 2. Regarding carbohydrates and glycerin removal, samples are not statistically different at a 5% significance level (one-way ANOVA), meaning that temperature did not influence these process variables. However, the Assay operated at 20 °C achieved the worse efficiencies, which can be attributed to a lower metabolic activity due to the reduced temperature [43]. Total alkalinity and total volatile acids in the influent were around 550 mgCaCO3.L−1 e 150 mgHAc.L−1, respectively. These same parameters for the effluent varied with the temperature, but there was not a defined trend. The order of magnitude of these variables for the effluent was 250 mgCaCO3.L-1 for total alkalinity and 2100 mgHAc.L-1. Note that in the Assays operated at the lowest temperatures (20–25 °C), there was a predominance of acetic acid in the volatile intermediate acids (20.8 and 29.4 mmol.L−1, respectively) and in the Assays operated at higher temperatures (30–35 °C) both acetic acid and ethanol were predominant (Assay 30 °C: 12.9 and 16.4 mmol.L−1, Assay 35 °C: 19.9 and 15.8 mmol.L−1, respectively). These changes in volatile intermediate acids distribution with temperature alteration can be attributed to the metabolic shift induced by different bacteria that were dominant at each temperature [44]. Reactor performance regarding biogas production was considerably better in the Assay operated at 30 °C, in which 2034 mLbiogas.cycle−1 and 1267 mLH2.cycle−1, with 61% of hydrogen, were produced, achieving a productivity of 129.0 molH2. m-3.d−1 (Fig. 4 ). Analyzing Fig. 3 and Table 2, it is possible to see that the Assay operated at 35 °C had the potential to achieve a very high hydrogen production, but the exacerbated amount of biomass that was produced in the reactor (MTVS) during this condition caused a rapid decrease in hydrogen production, with consequent impossibility of recovery (even with the periodic washing performed in the reactor). By analyzing the yields with respect to the applied load in terms of COD and substrate, the Assay operated at 30 °C also achieved the best results: 5.4 molH2.kgCOD−1 and 1.4 molH2.molSubstrate−1, respectively (Fig. 4). Lin [19] also found that hydrogen production increases at a temperature range between 30–34 °C in comparison with temperatures ranging from 28 to 32 °C. In a continuous anaerobic reactor fed with glucose (a simple substrate easy to assimilate by microorganisms), they found an increase from 290 to 359 molH2. m−3.d-1 when temperature range increased. Wang and Wan [44], on the other hand, conducted batch tests for anaerobic biohydrogen production from glucose and found that the increase in process temperature is beneficial to hydrogen production reaching an optimum point at 40 °C. Nevertheless, their study also showed that biomass production increased with temperature, but that did not cause process instability (probably due to the fact that their batch tests only had a volume of 150 mL); which was the main cause for the process failure at 35 °C of this study."
13,Kinetic model of metabolic pathways,"3.4 Kinetic model of metabolic pathways Table 3 shows the values of the adjusted kinetic parameters for the model and Fig. 5 shows the values obtained experimentally (markers) and the values obtained by the adjusted kinetic model (lines) for Assays 4, 5, 1 and 6, both along the cycle for the main variables that are monitored and that are related to the understanding of the acidogenic metabolism. The model was effective in fitting the experimental data, validating the behavior interpretation of the kinetic parameters in all experimental conditions. Hydrogen production comes similarly from acetic, butyric and valeric routes (20 °C: k1H = 0.2 h−1, k3H = 0.2 h−1, k4H = 0.3 h−1; 25 °C: k1H = 0.6 h−1, k3H = 0.6 h−1, k4H = 0.6 h−1; 30 °C: k1H = 1.4 h−1, k3H = 1.4 h−1, k4H = 1.4 h−1; 35 °C: k1H = 0.4 h−1, k3H = 0.5 h−1, k4H = 0.6 h−1). This is a tendency found in assays operated in fed-batch mode [16]. However, in the Assay operated at 30 °C, the kinetic parameters are higher, which is in accordance with the experimental data. Analyzing the damaging reactions for hydrogen production (Eqs. (2) and (5)), it can be inferred that the increase in temperature increases the consumption of hydrogen by propionic acid production (20 °C to 35 °C: k2H = 0.0 h−1, k2H = 0.0 h−1, k2H = 0.1 h−1, k2H = 0.2 h−1) and ethanol production (k5ETOH = 0.6 h−1, k5ETOH = 1.1 h−1, k5ETOH = 1.8 h−1, k5ETOH = 3.0 h−1), although the increase in temperature also increases hydrogen production from acidogenesis. Acetogenesis (Eqs. (6)–(8)) had little influence on the production of hydrogen compared to acidogenesis, which is in agreement with the theory of anaerobic digestion, as can be seen by the parameters k6H, k7H, k8H from all assays. The absence of methane in the biogas cancelled methanogesis, i.e., it was inhibited in all assays, justifying the values of k9HAc, k9M, k10H, k10M equal to 0 h−1 in all conditions. Finally, regarding acetic acid consumption (for growth of microorganisms such as Megasphaera), it is possible to observe that it had a greater importance in Assay 3 (k11HAc = 8.5 h-1). Considering the system and assays proposed, it is worth to mention that the experimental- measurement of specific microorganisms’ growth kinetics was not performed, since its growth variation is minimal in 3 h, which is the cycle length."
14,Arrhenius’ model and activation energy estimation,"3.5 Arrhenius’ model and activation energy estimation Since the Assay performed at 35 °C was greatly influence by biomass growth, its kinetic constants were excluded from the fitting. The kinetic constants used for the adjustment are presented in Table 4 . Fig. 6 shows the fitting to the Arrhenius Equation. From Fig. 6 and from the adjustment, it was possible to estimate the following activation energies for Eq. (1)–(4): 135 kJ.mol−1 (acetic acid production), 221 kJ.mol−1 (propionic acid production), 146 kJ.mol−1 (butyric acid production) and 109 kJ.mol−1 (valeric acid production), respectively. Based on the intermediate volatile acids measured in Assays 4, 5, 1 and 5, it is possible to see that indeed it is easier to produce acetic acid than propionic acid, which is in accordance with the activation energies found. But even smaller concentrations of butyric acid and valeric acid were measured, which means that there are maybe other impairments to these acids production or that the experimental data was too low to make a proper adjustment. There are very few studies in the published literature about the estimation of activation energies of the anaerobic digestion biochemical reactions. Veeken and Hamelers [47] found an activation energy for hydrolysis of biowastes of 64 kJ.mol−1 at mesophilic temperatures and Ge et al. [48] found that the hydrolysis of cellulose has an activation energy of 31 kJ.mol−1 in a thermophilic temperature, which is in agreement with the order of magnitude of the energies found in this paper."
15,Conclusions,"The effect of micronutrients solution added to the medium, heat shock pretreatment performed in the inoculum and temperature of operation in the mesophilic range (20, 25, 30 and 35 °C) on hydrogen production in an AnSBBR that co-digested dairy industry effluent (cheese whey) and biodiesel production effluent (glycerin) were studied. Both micronutrient solution and inoculum pretreatment were proven necessary for a better hydrogen productivity. The best condition for hydrogen production was at the temperature of 30 °C, in which it was achieved a productivity of 129.0 molH2. m−3.d-1 and a yield of 5.4 molH2.kgCOD-1 with 97% of substrate removal. A kinetic model was fitted to the process; it was observed that the majority of hydrogen production comes from the acidogenesis phase and similarly from acetic, butyric and valeric routes. The kinetic constants were used to estimate the activation energy of each reaction of the acidogenesis phase by using the Arrhenius model, which led to activation energies in the order of magnitude of 110–220 kJ.mol-1."
