0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen production has been regarded as one of the most feasible strategy for alternative energy generation. And graphene-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was proved to be a promising candidate for visible-light-responsive photocatalytic applications in recent years, because of its suitable bandgap and abundant raw materials. Many articles on the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of carbon nitride have been reported since 2008 [1]. However, g-C3N4 is still limited by its large surface reaction energy barrier, small specific surface area and weak separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers [2]. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop effect strategies to solve these questions of g-C3N4, such as doping [3,4], heterojunction fabrication [5–8], nanostructure design [9–11] and surface modification [12–14] etc. Single atoms of select transition metals supported on carbon substrates have emerged as a unique system for photocatalysis because of the maximal atom utilization (≈100 %) and the higher efficiency [15]. The carrier matrix, such as g-C3N4, not only provides an anchor site for a single metal atom, but also changes the charge density of the metal atoms due to the strong interfacial interaction between the metal atoms and the adjacent carbon and nitrogen atoms on graphite skeleton. When the size of the nanoparticles is reduced to single atomic level, the metal-substrate interaction will be maximized, resulting in the creation of new catalytically active sites and new reaction pathways of the photocatalyst. Lei et al. [16] prepared a novel Fe-N4 sites modified carbon nanofiber, and the highly active of Fe-N species could boost the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance through reducing the potential barriers and optimizing the reaction pathways. Li et al. [17] prepared an isolated single Pt atom anchored g-C3N4 by a simple liquid-phase reaction at low temperature to modulate the electronic structure of g-C3N4 and promote the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2 generation performance. Ohn et al. [18] developed molecularly dispersed Ni-based species on g-C3N4 by thermal treatment. The Ni-containing molecular species in the hybrids exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for the OER because of the well-dispersed Ni-based species. Meanwhile, rhodium phosphide exhibits outstanding co-catalytic capacity in the field of catalysis. Song et al. [19] fabricated a rhodium phosphide cocatalyst modified CdS photocatalyst for the photocatalytic H2 production under visible light. Strong electron transfer capability of RhP improved the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. Pu et al. [20] developed Rh2P nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon core-shell structure with robust and durable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance over a wide-range pH condition, which was attributed to the lower hydrogen evolution overpotential. Kim et al. [21] prepared Rh-P catalysts on a carbon paper substrate via simple electrodeposition, and the obtained catalyst showed high activity for hydrogen evolution. However, up to now, there is few research on fabricating single-site phosphides modified photocatalyst and their co-catalytic capacities. Therefore, on one hand, it is necessary to further study the preparation method for single-site Rh-phosphide and the corresponding unique properties. On the other hand, the fixed-site and chemical structure of the single-site phosphide on the carbon-nitride-based substrate should also be revealed. Herein, porous g-C3N4 with large specific surface area was prepared. The large specific surface area of g-C3N4 could provide more anchor sites for single-site Rh atoms fixation by strong interfacial interaction. Then, the Rh atoms would transform to single-site Rh-P by further in situ phosphorization to form a novel Rh-P single-sites modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst. Lastly, the chemical bonding state, single-site anchor structure and corresponding improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance were researched."

2,Fabrication of g-C3N4 photocatalysts,"2.1 Fabrication of g-C3N4 photocatalysts All reagents used in this study were purchased from Aladdin Corporation with analytical grade. In general, the conventional g-C3N4 was prepared through traditional thermal method. 10 g melamine was put into a crucible with a covered aluminum foil, then heated up to 550 °C in a muffle furnace with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min for 4 h."
3,Fabrication of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Fabrication of the photocatalysts For porous g-C3N4 photocatalysts fabrication, 3 g melamine and 4.8 g urea were dispersed into 80 mL deionized water. After continuous stirring for 0.5 h, the homogeneous solution was poured into a 100 mL autoclave with Teflon liner and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the mixture was filtered and dried under 60 °C for 24 h. And then the obtained mixture powder was calcined through the same steps as fabrication of g-C3N4. The prepared sample was denoted as CN(H). For Rh/CN(H) photocatalysts fabrication, 0.2 g prepared porous CN(H) was dispersed into 50 mL deionized water, and then 50 μL 0.5 wt% Rh(NO3)3 solution was added into the mixed solution with continuous stirring, and then stirred at 60 °C until drying. The obtained mixture was put in the tube furnace and annealed at 400 °C in Ar atmosphere for 2 h. The calcined powder was labeled as Rh/CN(H). The Rh-P/CN(H) was synthesized using sodium hypophosphite as the P precursor. In brief, 0.02 g sodium hypophosphite and 0.1 g Rh/CN(H) was placed in the two ends of porcelain boat, and the boat was placed in the tube furnace with sodium hypophosphite in the direction of the upper airflow with Ar atmosphere as the protective atmosphere. The calcined temperature was kept at 300 °C for 2 h. As a comparison, PCN(H) was prepared in the same way except that the Rh/CN(H) precursor was replaced by CN(H). And the conventional NiP on the as-prepared CN(H) was prepared in the same way except that the Rh(NO3)3 was replaced by Ni(NO3)2."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline structures of the samples were identified through X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-2500/PC, Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). The micro-morphologies of the samples were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6700 F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). High-angle-annular-dark-field (HAADF) imaging and mappings were executed using a JEOL ARM200 F (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV with a thermal filed-emission gun and a probe Cs corrector (CEOS GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The elementary compositions and bonding information of the samples were analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra, Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, England, UK). The optical absorptions of the solid-state samples were tested by a UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (UV–vis DRS, U-41000, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan)."
5,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.4 Photocatalytic reaction The photocatalytic activities of the samples were tested by photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light. In the photocatalytic hydrogen production test, 20 mg catalyst powder was dispersed in 100 mL aqueous solution which contained 10 vol % triethanolamine as sacrificial electron donor and 1 wt % H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aladdin Co., Shanghai, China) photo-assisted deposition as co-catalyst, and the mixture was kept continuous stirring. Before the test, the photoreaction system was vacuumed until the pressure gage was stable. Externally illuminating of 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Changtuo Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used as light source, and a 400 nm cut-off filter was added to achieve visible light with the light intensity of 250 mW/cm2. The illuminated area of the photocatalytic reaction is 28.3 cm2 (light spot diameter is 6 cm). The entire reaction system was kept at a constant 6 °C with condensed water. And the evolved hydrogen was measured through a gas chromatograph (GC-9790 II) with high-purity Ar as carrier gas. The test time interval was 0.5 h, and the reaction time was 4 h. The column oven, injection port and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) temperatures were 60 °C,100 °C and 130 °C."
6,Photoelectrodes preparation and photoelectrochemical performance,"2.5 Photoelectrodes preparation and photoelectrochemical performance The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 5 mg sample was dispersed in a mixture with 4 u L Nafion solution, 20 u L isopropyl alcohol and 276 u L deionized water. And after ultrasound dispersed evenly, 20 u L slurry was injected onto a 1 cm × 1 cm cleaned FTO conduction glass, and then annealed at 350 °C for 0.5 h to improve adhesion. Three-electrode system was used to measure the photoelectrochemical performance. The prepared electrodes, a large piece of platinum sheet and Ag/AgCl electrode filled with saturated KCl solution were used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 10 vol % triethanolamine solution was used as the electrolyte. All photoelectrochemical performance was carried out via a Zahner electrochemical system (Zahner Elektrik, Germany). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was performed at a bias of 0 V (vs. OCP) over a frequency range of 105∼10−1 HZ with an AC voltage magnitude of 5 mV under light illumination and dark. The current-time (i–t) curve was tested at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under light illumination. And linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves was measured from 0 V to -1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a scan rate of 0.02 V/s under light illumination. The above light with the intensity of 100 mW/cm2 (AM 1.5) was obtained from a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-FX300HU, Beijing Changtuo Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) via a standard solar simulator."
7,Theoretical calculation,"2.6 Theoretical calculation The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) module in Materials Studio (MS). The electron exchange and correlation energies were calculated by using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof form of the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE). The kinetic energy cutoff was set to 450 eV among all calculations and the Monkhorst-Pack grid was 1 × 2×1 k-point, the electronic minimization parameter of the total energy/atom convergence tolerance was 1.0 × 10−5 eV."
8,Results and discussion,"Firstly, the corresponding surface morphology of the series samples are shown in Fig. 1 A–E. It can be obviously observed that pure C3N4 exhibits layered structure and CN(H) shows both layered structure and fibrous structure, and the porous structure can also be observed in the TEM image of CN(H) (Fig. S1). Fig. S2 shows the XRD results of the series samples. All samples exhibit the characteristic peaks at 27.3° corresponding to the interlayer-stacking peak, indicating that the layered structure of the series samples was maintained even after different modification. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) was fitted from the XRD results, which could infer the layer spacing of carbon nitride by Scherrer formula. The FWHM corresponding to the series samples are presented in Table S1, and the larger half-peak width represents the smaller interlayer spacing at the same diffraction angle. It is obvious that the FWHM of CN(H) is bigger than that of pure C3N4. While, after the second thermal treatment such as Rh anchoring and phosphating, the FWHM decrease. Even though, the FWHM of the samples after modification were bigger than that of pure C3N4. The above FWHM results verify the existence of the fibrous and porous structure which could decrease the interlayer spacing of pure C3N4. The formation of fibrous and porous structures is mainly due to the erosion of layered structures by NH3 and CO2 produced by urea decomposition during the hydrothermal processes. After different modification methods treatment, such as phosphating and Rh anchoring, as shown in Fig. 1C–E, both structures were maintained on the materials. The TEM images of Rh-P/CN(H) shown in Fig. 1F–G further indicate that the layered structure and fibrous structure are both existed. Interestingly, the porous structure can be observed clearly in Fig. 1H, which is also induced by the NH3 and CO2 erosion. However, under this resolution, Rh cluster can’t be observed in the TEM image, even after Rh anchoring. Aberration-corrected STEM allow the image at the atomic level attributed to its high resolution and sensitivity to chemical composition, especially for heavy metal atoms under HAADF (high-angle-annular-dark-field) [15]. Therefore, in order to determine the anchoring state of Rh-P, HAADF-STEM measurement was employed. The result was shown in Fig. 1I, the bright dots observed in the image which are circled in red areas indicate that the anchored Rh-P were dispersed on the framework of C3N4 by single site state. These single site state Rh-P dots might provide more active reactive sites and reduce the redox energy barrier of the C3N4 photocatalyst for boosting the photocatalytic performance. From Fig. 1I, the Rh-P dots with single-site state can be observed clearly, however, the information of distribution uniformity can’t be obtained. So, the distribution of elements for Rh-P/CN(H) were detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the STEM, the corresponding results shown in Fig. 2 . From which, we can get the information that C, N, O, P and Rh elements are distributed homogeneously on the surface of the C3N4 nanosheets, indicating that Rh-P single-site dots are anchored uniformly on the surface of C3N4 nanosheets. Fig. 3 A presents the XPS results of the series samples. The survey spectra of Rh-P/CN(H) exhibit Rh and P characteristic peaks besides C, N and O peaks, indicating that Rh and P elements are successful introduced into CN framework, and this phenomenon is consistent with the above EDS mapping results. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Rh 3d are presented in Fig. 3B, in which Rh-P/CN(H) shows two peaks at 309.2 eV and 313.9 eV attributed to Rh 3d 5/2 region and Rh 3d 3/2 region, respectively (with well-separated spin-orbit components, Δmetal =4.7 eV) [22]. However, Rh/CN(H) shows peak at 308.9 eV attributed to Rh 3d 5/2 region, which is well matched with the value for Rh3+ in Rh2O3 (308.8 eV), and the slight shift for Rh-P/CN(H) is caused by the partial surface oxidation during phosphating process [23]. The similar results can also be observed in the high-resolution XPS spectra of P 2p (Fig. 3C) and O 1s (Fig. 3D). The P 2p peak was fitted into three peaks. The peak located at 134.9 eV can be assigned to P-Rh [24], and the peak located at 133.4 eV corresponding to the characteristic peak of PN coordination [25]. While, the last peak located at 134.2 eV is assigned to the phosphate species which caused by the formation of HPO4 2− during the heat treatment process with the presence of sodium hypophosphite [23]. The peak appeared at 532.4 eV in the O 1s spectra assigned to PO group is caused by the surface oxidation. And the high-resolution spectra of C 1s and N 1s are presented in Fig. S3A-B. The peaks at 288.4 eV and 284.9 eV are corresponded to CNC and CC for C 1s spectra [26], and peaks at 398.8 eV, 399.4 eV, 401 eV are corresponded to CNC, N(C) 3 and CNHx for N 1s spectra [27], respectively. These all peaks match well with those of C3N4, indicating that the framework of carbon nitride keep well after the different modification process. UV–vis absorption spectra of the series samples shown in Fig. S4 reveal a slight blue shift in the absorption threshold of CN(H) compared to that of C3N4, which might be attributed to the quantum confinement effect resulted from the reduction in layer spacing. And the absorption threshold for other samples are slightly broadened after phosphating and Rh doping. However, the shifts in the absorption threshold of the samples are so small that they will not obviously influence the photocatalytic performance. To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the series samples, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water under visible light was measured. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the as-prepared C3N4 produce 5.06 umol hydrogen in 4 h, and the hydrogen evolution rate of CN(H) increases to 22.38 umol, which is 4 times larger than that of the former. The increasement might be attributed to the layer reduction and the formation of porous structure which can provide more active reaction sites. After calcination with the presence of sodium hypophosphite, the hydrogen evolution rate of the obtained PCN(H) shows a slight increase, indicating that there is no favor for increasing the hydrogen evolution activity of the C3N4 by surface change during phosphating. Meanwhile, the activity of the single-site Rh anchored C3N4 photocatalyst increases to 37.57 μmol in 4 h. After further phosphating process, the prepared Rh-P/CN(H) shows a superior activity, and the hydrogen evolution rate increases rapidly to 166.28 μmol within 4 h, which is almost 33 times that of pure C3N4. To demonstrate the superiority of Rh-P/CN(H), the conventional NiP on the as-prepared CN(H) labeled as Ni-P/CN(H) was fabricated also in the same way. A comparison of the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of the two catalysts are shown in Fig. S5, the Ni-P/CN(H) can produce 92.05 μmol hydrogen within 4 h, which is 55 % of the Rh-P/CN(H) under the same conditions. In order to check the stability of the most outstanding photocatalyst among the series samples, the stability of Rh-P/CN(H) was tested further. As shown in Fig. 4B, after 4 cycle’s reaction, there is nearly no hydrogen evolution rate decline, suggesting that Rh-P/CN(H) maintain well stability to against photocorrosion. And the structure stability of Rh-P/CN(H) after photocatalytic reaction was also tested through XPS, the corresponding results are presented in Fig. S6. It can be found that there is no obvious chemical structure change, indicating that the catalyst has excellent reproducibility and stability. Photoelectrochemical test was measured to explain the different photocatalytic performance of the series samples. In order to simulate the actual photocatalytic environment and explore the HER activity in the presence of sacrificial agent, we first employed 10 vol% triethanolamine solution as electrolyte rather than the conventional Na2SO4 solution. LSV curves were used to investigate the hydrogen evolution performance under light illumination. As shown in Fig. 4C, the onset potential of Rh-P/CN(H) is more positive than that of C3N4. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density of Rh-P/CN(H) is higher than that of C3N4, indicating that Rh-P single-site can greatly reduce the surface energy barrier of C3N4 to improve the photogenerated hole consumption ratio and then to increase the density of free photogenerated electron for hydrogen evolution at a lower potential. I-t curves of the pure C3N4 and Rh-P/CN(H) were shown in Fig. 4D, the photocurrent density of Rh-P/CN(H) is significantly larger than that of the pure C3N4, indicating a higher density of free photogenerated electron and the faster electronic transfer capability. The electron migration capacity of C3N4 and Rh-P/CN(H) can be characterized by EIS result. As shown in Fig. 4E, the impedance arc radius of Rh-P/CN(H) is much smaller than that of pure C3N4 whether in light or dark conditions, indicating that the charge transfer capacity in the bulk or solid-electrolyte interface of Rh-P/CN(H) is much higher than that of pure C3N4. In order to further investigate the change in the electronic property of C3N4 after Rh or Rh-P single-sites modification, DFT calculations were performed. Because of the bigger atomic radius, the Rh atom is difficult to substitute C and N atoms in the carbon nitride structure. Thus, the single site Rh atom is more inclined to anchor on the C-N framework. As shown in Fig. 5 A, there are three different models of Rh atom sites anchoring in pristine C3N4 framework. The total energy of the Rh-anchored C3N4 at different sites were calculated, and the value keep the same at -21945.51 eV, indicating that Rh atom is anchored in the middle of the tri-s-triazine units. As the total energy is lower than that of pristine C3N4 (E=−18917.34 eV), the Rh-anchored C3N4 model is more stable after modification. After further phosphating process, there are three different anchoring sites for Rh-P/CN(H). The different structure and the total energy with different sites for Rh-P/CN(H) are shown in Fig. S7, and the corresponding energy for different anchoring models are calculated to be -21776.32 eV, -22603.54 eV and -22605.13 eV, respectively. So, the optimal anchoring site for Rh-P/CN(H) is obtained by site 3 because of its lower total energy, and the corresponding optimization model for Rh-P/CN(H) is presented in Fig. 5B. The differences in spatial charge distributions through DFT calculation are shown in Fig. 5C and D, in which the yellow region denotes charge accumulation while blue denotes charge depletion. It’s obvious that the anchored single-site Rh-P on carbon nitride framework can accumulate electrons. Therefore, the transport speed of the photogenerated electrons from the bulk of C3N4 to Rh-P single-sites will be enhanced. With accelerating arriving of electrons at the single-site of Rh-P, the electrons will be fast transferred to the solid-liquid interface to increase the HER activity. To further compare the HER activity of the pristine C3N4 and Rh-P/CN(H). The standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the HER of the series samples were calculated. The corresponding details of the DFT calculations are exhibited in supporting information [28], and the results of the series samples are shown in Fig. 5E. For C3N4 and Rh-P/CN(H), ΔG was determined to be 2.3183 eV and 0.6499 eV, respectively. The lower free energy of Rh-P/CN(H) is more favorable for its hydrogen ion adsorption and produced hydrogen desorption. Therefore, the DFT calculation results provide the positive support information and possible mechanism for the improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution property on Rh-P single-site modified C3N4 photocatalyst. And in order to explore the role played by phosphating in improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, the DFT calculation for the HER of Rh/CN(H), Rh-P/CN(H) and single atom Rh anchored in CN skeleton were also calculated, the results are presented in Fig. S8. ΔG for the HER of Rh/CN(H) was determined to be -1.3035 eV, the absolute value is bigger than that value of Rh-P/CN(H), this calculation result is consistent with the above photocatalytic hydrogen production performance (Fig. 4A), and the absolute value of Rh/CN(H) is also bigger than that value of single atom Rh anchored in CN skeleton, which caused by the formation of Rh-O in Rh/CN(H) (Fig. 3B). And the absolute value of Rh-P/CN(H) was decreased after phosphating, indicating that phosphating treatment can play an important role in reducing Rh-O and improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. Fig. 6 presents the schematic illustration of the possible functions of the Rh-P single-site anchored on C3N4 photocatalyst. The single-site Rh-P exhibit excellent capacity for accumulating photo-generated electrons just like that “whirl” in the water under visible light illumination, and the single-site Rh-P become reactive sites for hydrogen evolution at the presence of TEOA which serve as hole sacrificial agent. Thus, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was improved."
9,Conclusions,"In this article, we fabricated single-site Rh-P modified carbon nitride photocatalyst via heat treatment and phosphating process. The Rh-P modified carbon nitride exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, which is 33 times that of pure C3N4. The nanostructure analysis and DFT results indicate that Rh-P are atomically dispersed on the framework of carbon nitride, and the anchored single-site Rh-P can accumulate photogenerated electrons by changing the electronic structure of g-C3N4. In addition, the photoelectrochemical results revealed that single site Rh-P can accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 to electrolyte for water reduction and reduce the hydrogen evolution barrier simultaneously, thus improving its photocatalytic performance."
