0,Introduction,"Since the fossil fuels are threatened by depletion, the full utilization of renewable energy is very essential for the sustainable development of society. Biodiesel, a kind of renewable energy, is formed by the transesterification of triglycerides in biomass. The utilization of green catalytic technology to convert bio-renewable raw materials into commercial chemicals and clean fuels have attracted widespread attention [1]. With the substantial increase in the annual output of biodiesel, the main by-product glycerol has become more and more abundant [2] and has been reported as one of the top 12 cornerstone chemical platform compounds in renewable biomass products [3]. Therefore, products of glycerol hydrogenolysis have become a research hotspot in recent years. Especially the 1,2(3)-propanediol (1,2(3)-PDO) is the basic raw stock, severs as significant production of cosmetics, antifreeze, pharmaceuticals, paints, polyester resins, and food additives [4]. 1,3-PDO is a kind of chemical substance and one of the six new petrochemical products with great utilization value. Its polycondensation monomer can be used in plastics production, typically as poly terephthalate, polyurethane, methyl ester polyester, monomer ring compound, and polyether, etc [1-4]. At present, how to develop efficient hydrogenation catalysts with outstanding catalytic activity (Include: high selectivity and stability) has become the key to promote the production and application of the glycerol hydrogenolysis technique. Meanwhile, the proportion of C-C / C-O in glycerol molecules, which requires a thorough and complete understanding of bonding and bond cleavage mechanisms in biodiesel derivatives."
