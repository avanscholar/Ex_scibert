0,Introduction,"In the process of C2H4 production by pyrolyzing petroleum hydrocarbons, trace C2H2 can be generated, which not only reduces the property of ethylene polymer, but also leads to the catalyst deactivation of C2H4 polymerization due to green oil formation, so trace C2H2 must be removed from the rich-feedstock C2H4 [1,2]. Commonly, C2H2 selective hydrogenation to C2H4 is an effective method [3,4]. Nowadays, Pd-based catalysts have been industrially used to catalyze the hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 [5,6], however, the formation of the hydrides and carbide species for Pd-based catalysts are easy to deactivate the catalyst [7,8]. In recent years, Cu-based catalysts have attracted extensive interests due to high C2H4 selectivity [9,10]; however, they have low catalytic activity and favored the CC polymerization to form green oil leading to catalyst deactivation [9,11]. Thus, developing the catalysts with high activity, high selectivity and high stability have attracted increasing interest [12–18]. Among them, the single-atom catalysts show excellent catalytic performance in C2H2 selective hydrogenation due to high activity and atomic utilization [15–18], however, the decreased stability of the single-atom catalysts and the easy occurrence of agglomeration also deactivate the catalyst [19]. Within the last ten decades, the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) have attracted extensive attention in catalytic hydrogenation due to their ordered atomic arrangement, unique electronic and structural characteristics, and excellent stability [20,21]. This type of catalyst can effectively separate active centers, and present unique catalytic performance [22–28]. For example, Wang et al. [24] experimentally showed CuxZn(x = 1,3) IMCs have better activity, selectivity, and higher stability for butadiene selective hydrogenation compared to Cu, which was ascribed to carbon deposit reduction. 4-aminophenylacetylene selectivity in 4-nitrophenylacetylene selective hydrogenation on PtZn IMCs is superior to that on the single-atom Pt and Pt nanoparticles, which is attributed to the easier adsorption of nitro groups by Zn atoms [25]. The experimentally prepared NixMy(M = Ga, Sn) IMCs with uniform size by Liu et al. [26] showed better C2H4 selectivity and the stability compared to Pd-based catalysts. Liu et al. [22] experimentally found an enhanced catalytic performance of CuNi IMCs for C2H2 selective hydrogenation due to the presence of isolated metal active center and the alloying effect of Ni and Cu. Zhou et al. [20] experimentally showed that Pd-Zn-Pd ensembles of PdZn IMCs promote H2 dissociation and C2H4 desorption, which enhance C2H4 selectivity. Feng et al. [6] experimentally and theoretically showed that PdIn(110) surface with the Pd single-atom as active centers has the elevated C2H4 selectivity. As mentioned above, the intermetallic compounds have presented excellent catalytic performance toward selective hydrogenation reactions; moreover, some studies found the excellent catalytic performance of Cu or Pd intermetallic compounds toward C2H2 selective hydrogenation. However, to date, few studies have been carried out to examine the influences of the partner metal type and its ratio in the Cu or Pd intermetallic compounds on the catalytic performance of C2H2 hydrogenation, which still remain elusive; the surface structure characteristics of intermetallic compounds with excellent catalytic performance are also unclear. Further, the most suitable Cu or Pd intermetallic compounds remain unknown. In order to solve above issues, this study is designed to perform a systematical study about C2H2 selective hydrogenation on a series of Cu and Pd intermetallic compounds with different partner metal types and ratios, which include the CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) and PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) IMCs corresponding to different Cu/M and Pd/N ratios of 1/1, 3/1 and 1/3. The results are expected to obtain the most suitable partner metal type and ratio among CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs catalysts with superior performance in C2H2 selective hydrogenation, and provide a guideline to design and screen out promising intermetallic compound catalysts for selective hydrogenation of alkynes."
1,Computational details,
2,Computational method,"2.1 Computational method The present DFT calculations were implemented by the Dmol3 code [29,30] in Materials Studio 8.0 for CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt, Pd, Au and Ag) and PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) IMCs catalysts. The GGA and PBE [31,32] were applied to treat the exchange-correlation potential. The effective core potential (ECP) basis set was performed for IMCs, and the all-electron basis was applied to other species. The valence wave functions were expanded by the double-numeric polarized (DNP) basis set [33,34]. The k-points of (3 × 3 × 1) was used to handle surface models. A smearing width of 0.005 Ha was used. The transition states of C2H2 selective hydrogenation was obtained by the complete LST/QST technique [35,36]. TS confirmation and frequency analysis were implemented to confirm the structure of transition state."
3,Surface model,"2.2 Surface model For the Cu IMCs, the CuxMy(M = Pd, Pt, Au) with Cu/M ratio of 3/1, 1/3 and 1/1 [37–39] are considered, while for the CuxMy(M = Zn, Ni), only the widely reported Cu/M ratios of 1/1 and 3/1 [24,40–44] are examined; the widely reported CuxAgy corresponds to Cu/Ag ratio of 3/1 [41]. For the Pd IMCs, PdxNy(N=Cu, Au and Ag) with Pd/N ratio of 3/1, 1/3 and 1/1 are considered [37], while PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga) only considers the widely reported Pd/N ratio of 1/1 [27,45], PdxIny corresponds to Pd/In ratio of 1/1 and 3/1 [6,46], Pd x Sn y corresponds to the ratio of 3/1 [47]. Further, in order to evaluate the catalytic performance of Cu IMCs and Pd IMCs catalysts in this study, Pd catalyst is selected as a reference. The optimized lattice parameters of Pd, Cu IMCs and Pd IMCs are summarized in Table S1, the calculated lattice parameters are close to the experimental values [27,37,39–41,43,46,47]. For the surface model, based on the low surface energy and dominantly exposed surface [6,27,43], the p(3 × 3) (110) surface is selected for the Cu1Zn1, the p(3 × 3) (111) surface is selected for the Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Pt1, Cu1Pt3, Cu1Ni1, Cu3Ni1, Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1, Cu1Pd3, Cu1Au1, Cu3Au1, Cu1Au3, Cu3Ag1, Pd1Zn1, Pd3In1, Pd3Sn1, Pd1Ag1, Pd3Ag1, Pd1Ag3, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1, Pd1Au3 and Pd; the p(3 × 2) (110) and p(4 × 2) (110) surfaces are selected for Pd1Ga1 and Pd1In1 IMCs, respectively. All catalysts contain four atomic layers except for PdGa(110) with seven atomic layers. The bottom two layers for all surfaces are fixed except for PdGa(110) surface with the bottom four layers fixed. A vacuum region of 15 Å is set to separate the periodic slabs. Fig. 1 shows the optimized model surfaces of Cu IMCs, Pd IMCs and Pd."
4,Results and discussion,
5,The possible routes of C2H2 selective hydrogenation,"3.1 The possible routes of C2H2 selective hydrogenation As shown in Fig. 2 , C2H2 selective hydrogenation includes the processes of the hydrogenation and polymerization. For the hydrogenation process, three possible routes exist, the first is C2H4 desorption route that C2H2(ad) is firstly hydrogenated via C2H3(ad) intermediate to generate C2H4(ad), followed by its desorption from the catalyst surface; the second is C2H4 hydrogenation route that C2H2(ad) is excessively hydrogenated to C2H5(ad) through C2H4 intermediate; the third is CHCH3 hydrogenation route that C2H2(ad) is excessively hydrogenated to C2H5(ad) through CHCH3 intermediate. The route of C2H4 desorption is the desired route to realize the removal of trace C2H2 in rich-C2H4 stream. Based on above analysis, the first is to determine the preference between C2H4 hydrogenation and its desorption by comparing the activation free energy between C2H4 hydrogenation and its desorption. Then, when C2H4 desorption route is favored, starting from the common intermediate C2H3 in three routes, the preference between C2H4 formation and CHCH3 formation is examined. Finally, the catalysts that can produce gaseous C2H4 are screened out. For the polymerization process, green oil is formed to block active centers and deactivate the catalysts. Most studies have shown that the precursor for the production of green oil is 1,3-butadiene [1,2,48], thus, three possible routes of 1,3-butadiene formation are investigated, the first is the coupling of adsorbed C2H2 to C4H4, followed by its hydrogenation to C4H6; the second is the coupling of adsorbed C2H2 and C2H3 to C4H5, followed by its hydrogenation to C4H6; the third is the coupling of adsorbed C2H3 to C4H6."
6,C2H2 selective hydrogenation on the Cu IMCs catalysts,"3.2 C2H2 selective hydrogenation on the Cu IMCs catalysts 3.2.1 The adsorption of C2H2 and C2H4 Since the amount of C2H2 in the C2H4-rich stream is very small, C2H2 must be strongly adsorbed on the catalyst than C2H4 to ensure the subsequent hydrogenation of C2H2. The most stable configurations of C2H2 and C2H4 on the Cu x M y (M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) IMCs are shown in Fig. S2. As shown in Fig. 3 a, on the Cu1Au1 and Cu1Au3 IMCs, the adsorption strength of C2H2 (37.2 and 16.1 kJ·mol−1) and C2H4 (1.1 and 1.9 kJ·mol−1) is very weak physisorption, namely, both Cu1Au1 and Cu1Au3 cannot validly adsorb trace C2H2 in rich-C2H4 stream, and therefore C2H2 selective hydrogenation cannot be performed. However, C2H2 has much higher adsorption energy at 425 K than C2H4 on other twelve types of Cu IMCs catalysts, including Cu1Zn1, Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Pt1, Cu1Pt3, Cu1Ni1, Cu3Ni1, Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1, Cu1Pd3, Cu3Au1 and Cu3Ag1, indicating that these twelve types of Cu IMCs catalysts favor C2H2 selective hydrogenation. Further, the adsorption energies and the stable configurations at 425 K of H, C2H3, CHCH3 and C2H5 species on twelve types of Cu IMCs are presented in Table S2 and Fig. S3. 3.2.2 The preference between C2H4 desorption and its hydrogenation Based on above analysis, the preference between C2H4 hydrogenation and C2H4 desorption is further examined on above twelve types of Cu IMCs catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4 . Among them, only on Cu1Pt3, C2H4 desorption is competitive with its hydrogenation (80.2 vs. 87.4 kJ·mol−1, Fig. 4e); whereas C2H4 prefers to desorb rather than its hydrogenation to C2H5 on other eleven types of Cu IMCs catalysts, including Cu1Zn1, Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Pt1, Cu1Ni1, Cu3Ni1, Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1, Cu1Pd3, Cu3Au1 and Cu3Ag1. Further, previous studies by Xu et al. [37] also showed that C2H4 desorption prefers to occur rather than its hydrogenation over the three-layers p(4 × 4) (111) surfaces of Cu1Pt1 and Cu3Pt1 IMCs at 473 K; the same results are also obtained by Wang et al. [49] on the three-layer p(3 × 3) (111) surfaces of Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1 and Cu1Pd3 IMCs at 400 K. Liu et al. [22] experimently showed that the homogeneous CuNi alloy is in favor of gaseous C2H4 formation. 3.2.3 The preference between C2H4 formation and CHCH3 formation As mentioned above, except for Cu1Pt3 IMCs, other eleven types of Cu IMCs are conducive to C2H4 desorption rather than being hydrogenated. Thus, starting from the common intermediate C2H3 in three routes, we further determine whether C2H4 is more easily formed than CHCH3 in C2H3 hydrogenation (see Figs. S4~S8). For the CuxZny IMCs, C2H3 hydrogenation to C2H4 is kinetically more favorable than its hydrogenation to CHCH3 on the Cu1Zn1 (40.8 vs. 180.6 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S4a) and Cu3Zn1 (65.6 vs. 204.7 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S4b). The same thing also occurs on the Cu1Pt1, Cu3Pt1, Cu1Ni1, Cu3Ni1, Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1, Cu3Au1 and Cu3Ag1, as presented in Figs. S5~S8. However, it is opposite on Cu1Pd3 (109.4 vs. 94.4 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S7c), while CHCH3 hydrogenation to C2H5 is more difficult compared to C2H4 formation and desorption (170.4 vs. 109.4 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S7c), thus, CHCH3 hydrogenation route is unfavorable on Cu1Pd3, which agree with the previous work by Wang et al. [49] on the three-layer p(3 × 3) (111) surfaces of Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1 and Cu1Pd3 IMCs at 400 K. Above results show that eleven types of Cu IMCs, including Cu1Zn1, Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Pt1, Cu1Ni1, Cu3Ni1, Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1, Cu3Au1, Cu3Ag1 and Cu1Pd3, preferentially favor C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4 and its subsequent desorption. Namely, C2H4 desorption route to produce gaseous C2H4 is dominant. 3.2.4 C2H4 formation activity and selectivity Since eleven types of CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) IMCs favor the production of gaseous C2H4, C2H4 formation activity and selectivity over these catalysts are calculated to evaluate the catalytic performance [37,50,51]. In this study, the descriptor, the energy difference between C2H4 hydrogenation and its desorption, is used to evaluate C2H4 selectivity, this descriptor as the simplest way can well quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate C2H4 selectivity in C2H2 selective hydrogenation, which has been widely used in the previous studies by Hu et al. [8,51–54], Mavrikakis et al. [37], Celik et al. [55], Hafner et al. [56], Kang et al. [18], Wang et al. [57,58] and Gong et al. [1], the obtained results can well present C2H4 selectivity over the reported catalysts and agrees with the experimental results. Meanwhile, C2H4 formation rate is calculated to evaluate C2H4 formation activity [59,60], which is calculated according to a two-step model [8,61] under the typically experimental conditions (T = 425 K, P = 1 atm; the partial pressure of C2H2, H2 and C2H4 correspond to 0.01, 0.1 and 0.89 atm, respectively) (the details are presented in the Supplementary Material). As listed in Table 1 , eleven types of Cu IMCs catalysts correspond to C2H4 selectivity of 130.3, 93.2, 24.0, 50.1, 30.0, 34.0, 49.6, 122.3, 45.1, 104.4 and 133.1 kJ·mol−1; correspondingly, C2H4 formation activity of 1.21 × 10−4, 5.27 × 10−1, 8.85 × 101, 8.08 × 10−4, 8.87 × 10−2, 1.33 × 101, 2.30 × 10−3, 4.77 × 106 , 3.17 × 10−1, 4.45 × 10−4 and 5.68 × 100 s−1∙site−1 on the Cu1Zn1, Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Pt1, Cu1Ni1, Cu3Ni1, Cu1Pd1, Cu3Pd1, Cu1Pd3, Cu3Au1 and Cu3Ag1, respectively. Above results show that Cu3Pd1 with the isolated single-atom Pd as active center exhibits outstanding C2H4 selectivity and activity (122.3 kJ·mol−1 and 4.77 × 106 s−1∙site−1). Hence, Cu3Pd1 can better promote C2H4 formation. 3.2.5 The influences of partner metal ratio and metal type on C2H4 formation Based on above results, among CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) IMCs, the CuxPdy, CuxAgy, CuxAuy and CuxNiy IMCs corresponding to Cu/Pd, Cu/Ag, Cu/Au and Cu/Ni ratio of 3/1 have better C2H4 formation activity and selectivity than the other Cu/M(M = Pd, Ag, Au and Ni) ratios; however, the CuxZny with the Cu/Zn ratio of 3/1 and CuxPty with the Cu/Pt ratio of 1/1 have high activity of C2H4 formation, whereas the CuxZny with the Cu/Zn ratio of 1/1 and CuxPty with the Cu/Pt ratio of 3/1 have high C2H4 selectivity. Thus, the partner metal ratio of CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) IMCs has a significant influence on C2H4 formation activity and selectivity. In addition, NiGa IMCs has better activity and selectivity than Ni and Ni3Ga IMCs for C2H2 selective hydrogenation to C2H4 [23]. PdIn presented better selectivity than Pd3In and Pd for HCOOH oxidation [62]. Ni3Sn2 displays the best furfuryl alcohol selectivity and its formation activity for furfural selective hydrogenation on the Ni3Sn1, Ni3Sn2 and Ni3Sn4 IMCs [63]. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, the partner metal type M (M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) in the CuxMy IMCs catalysts affects C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, among them, Cu3Pd1 catalyst displays remarkably high C2H4 formation activity and selectivity compared to other CuxMy IMCs catalysts, suggesting that Cu3Pd1 IMCs doped the partner metal Pd into Cu is the best choice for C2H2 selective hydrogenation among CuxMy IMCs. In addition, CuNi(111) is more favorable for carbon elimination than FeNi(111) and Ni(111) [40]. Wang et al. [49] found that PdCu3 displays the highest C2H4 formation activity and selectivity among PdCu, PdAg and PdAu IMCs."
7,C2H2 selective hydrogenation on the Pd IMCs catalysts,"3.3 C2H2 selective hydrogenation on the Pd IMCs catalysts 3.3.1 The adsorption of C2H2 and C2H4 Similar to Cu IMCs, the adsorptions of C2H2 and C2H4 on the PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) IMCs and Pd catalysts are examined (see details in Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 3b, the adsorption free energy of C2H2 and C2H4 on the Pd1Ag3 (52.6 and 43.0 kJ·mol−1) and Pd1Au3 (50.5 and 42.5 kJ·mol−1) is very close, which is not in favor of the effective adsorption of the trace C2H2 in a large amount of C2H4. However, C2H2 has much larger adsorption energy than C2H4 on the Pd1Zn1, Pd1Ga1, Pd1In1, Pd3In1, Pd3Sn1, Pd1Cu1, Pd3Cu1, Pd1Cu3, Pd1Ag1, Pd3Ag1, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1 and Pd at 425 K. Namely, C2H2 is more strongly adsorbed than C2H4 on above twelve types of Pd IMCs and Pd catalysts. Correspondingly, the adsorption energies and stable adsorption configurations at 425 K of H, C2H3, CHCH3 and C2H5 species on twelve types of Pd IMCs and Pd catalysts are presented in Table S2 and Fig. S3. 3.3.2 The preference between C2H4 desorption and its hydrogenation As mentioned above, the preference between C2H4 hydrogenation and its desorption is further examined on twelve types of Pd IMCs and Pd. As presented in Fig. 5 , C2H4 desorption occurs more easily compared to its hydrogenation on the Pd1Zn1, Pd1Ga1, Pd1In1, Pd3In1, Pd3Sn1, Pd1Ag1, Pd3Ag1, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1 and Pd. The same thing also occurs on the Pd1Cu1 (Fig. 4h), Pd1Cu3 (Fig. 4i) and Pd3Cu1 (Fig. 4j). Thus, the desorption of C2H4 is more favorable on these twelve types of Pd IMCs and Pd catalyst. Previous studies also showed that C2H4 desorption (48.0 kJ∙mol−1) is easier than its hydrogenation (84.0 kJ∙mol−1) on PdZn(100) IMCs at 0 K [20]; the same results also occur on the three-layer p(3 × 3) (111) surfaces of Pd1Ag1, Pd3Ag1, Pd1Au1 and Pd3Au1 IMCs at 400 K [49]. 3.3.3 The preference between C2H4 formation and CHCH3 formation For the PdxNy IMCs (see Figs. S9~S14), C2H3 is preferentially hydrogenated to generate C2H4 rather than CHCH3 on the Pd1Zn1 (Fig. S9a), Pd1Ga1 (Fig. S9b), Pd1In1 (Fig. S10a), Pd3In1 (Fig. S10b), Pd3Sn1 (Fig. S11), Pd1Ag1 (Fig S12a) and Pd1Au1 (Fig. S13a); the same thing also occurs on the Pd1Cu1 (Fig. S7a) and Pd1Cu3 (Fig. S7b). On the other hand, it is opposite on the Pd3Cu1 (Fig. S7c), Pd3Ag1 (Fig S12b), Pd3Au1 (Fig. S13b) and Pd (Fig. S14), however, CHCH3 hydrogenation to C2H5 is more difficult than C2H4 formation and desorption on the Pd3Cu1 (170.4 vs. 109.4 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S7c), Pd3Ag1 (173.7 vs. 131.6 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S12b), Pd3Au1 (89.7 vs. 83.3 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S13b) and Pd (126.9 vs. 109.0 kJ·mol−1, Fig. S14), thus, CHCH3 hydrogenation route is not easy to occur. Above results show that C2H3 hydrogenation to C2H4 and C2H4 desorption are favored on above twelve types of Pd IMCs and Pd catalysts, namely, C2H4 desorption route to form gaseous C2H4 is dominant among three hydrogenation routes. 3.3.4 C2H4 formation activity and selectivity As illustrated in Table 1, on twelve types of PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) IMCs and Pd catalysts, C2H4 selectivity is 83.6, 162.7, 217.0, 115.0, 125.6, 49.6, 45.1, 122.3, 44.1, 60.1, 36.0, 29.5 and 18.9 kJ·mol−1 on the Pd1Zn1, Pd1Ga1, Pd1In1, Pd3In1, Pd3Sn1, Pd1Cu1, Pd3Cu1, Pd1Cu3, Pd1Ag1, Pd3Ag1, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1 and Pd catalysts. Correspondingly, C2H4 formation activity is 2.57 × 100, 1.20 × 10−3, 2.05 × 100, 1.23 × 10−5, 9.38 × 10−2, 2.30 × 10−3, 3.17 × 10−1, 4.77 × 106 , 4.41 × 100, 5.92 × 10−4, 3.01 × 104, 5.12 × 102 and 3.55 × 10−1 s−1∙site−1, respectively. Thus, among the PdxNy IMCs, Pd1Cu3 IMCs with the surface single-atom Pd as active center presents outstanding selectivity and activity (122.3 kJ·mol−1 and 4.77 × 106 ∙s−1∙site−1) for gaseous C2H4 formation. 3.3.5 The influences of partner metal ratio and metal type on C2H4 formation Similarly, the influences of partner metal ratio and type in the PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) IMCs on C2H4 formation activity and selectivity are also obvious. Among them, the PdxIny, PdxAgy and PdxAuy IMCs corresponding to Pd/In, Pd/Ag and Pd/Au ratio of 1/1 have superior C2H4 formation activity and selectivity than other Pd/N(N = In, Ag and Au) ratios. Similarly, the PdxZny and PdxGay IMCs also correspond to the Pd/Zn or Pd/Ga ratio of 1/1. However, PdxSny IMCs correspond to the Pd/Sn ratio of 3/1, and it is Pd/Cu ratio of 1/3 for PdxCuy IMCs. Thus, the Pd1Zn1, Pd1Ga1, Pd1In1, Pd1Ag1, Pd1Au1, Pd3Sn1 and Pd1Cu3 IMCs favor the formation of gaseous C2H4. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6 , the partner metal type N(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) in PdxNy IMCs affects C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, among them, Pd1Cu3 IMCs displays the highest activity and superior selectivity for C2H4 formation compared to other six types of PdxNy IMCs catalysts, namely, Pd1Cu3 IMCs becomes the best choice for C2H2 selective hydrogenation among PdxNy IMCs."
8,General discussions,"3.4 General discussions 3.4.1 The influences of partner metal ratio and type on C2H4 formation activity and selectivity Noble-metal Pd has been industrially used to remove trace C2H2 from a large amount of C2H4 due to its high hydrogenation activity [8,64], aiming at obtaining the influences of partner metal ratio and type in the CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs on C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, the comparisons of the activity and selectivity between CuxMy/PdxNy IMCs and Pd catalysts are carried out. For the CuxMy IMCs, all considered catalysts exhibit better C2H4 selectivity (kJ·mol−1) compared to Pd catalyst, following the order of Cu3Ag1(133.1)> Cu1Zn1(130.3)>Cu3Pd1(122.3)>Cu3Au1(104.4)>Cu3Zn1(93.2)>Cu3Pt1(50.1)>Cu1Pd1(49.6)>Cu1Pd3(45.1)>Cu3Ni1(34.0)>Cu1Ni1(30.0)>Cu1Pt1(24.0)>Pd(18.9). The activity (s−1∙site−1) of C2H4 formation on the Cu3Pd1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Ni1, Cu3Ag1 and Cu3Zn1 (4.77 × 106, 8.85 × 101, 1.33 × 101, 5.68 × 100 and 5.27 × 10−1) is superior to that on Pd catalyst (3.55 × 10−1). Thus, C2H4 formation activity and selectivity on five types of Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Ni1, Cu3Pd1 and Cu3Ag1 IMCs have a greater improvement compared to that on Pd catalyst. Among them, Cu3Pd1 that has the surface single-atom Pd as active center displays outstanding C2H4 formation activity and selectivity. For the PdxNy IMCs, C2H4 selectivity (kJ·mol−1) follows the order of Pd1In1(217.0)>Pd1Ga1(162.7)>Pd3Sn1(125.6)>Pd1Cu3(122.3)>Pd3In1(115.0)>Pd1Zn1 (83.6)>Pd3Ag1(60.1)>Pd1Cu1(49.6)>Pd3Cu1(45.1)>Pd1Ag1(44.1)>Pd1Au1(36.0)>Pd3Au1(29.5)>Pd(18.9). The activity (s−1∙site−1) of C2H4 formation on the Pd1Cu3, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1, Pd1Ag1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 (4.77 × 106, 3.01 × 104, 5.12 × 102, 4.41 × 100, 2.57 × 100 and 2.05 × 100) is superior to that on Pd catalyst (3.55 × 10−1). Namely, C2H4 formation activity and selectivity on six types of Pd1Cu3, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1, Pd1Ag1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs have been greatly improved in comparison with that on Pd catalyst, among them, Pd1Cu3 IMCs corresponding to the isolated surface single-atom Pd active center exhibits excellent C2H4 formation activity and selectivity. In general, as presented in Fig. 6, among all considered CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs in this study, PdxCuy IMCs that has the Pd/Cu ratio of 1: 3 becomes the best choice for C2H2 hydrogenation to produce gaseous C2H4 with excellent activity and selectivity (4.77 × 106 s−1∙site−1 and 122.3 kJ·mol−1) in comparison with other CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs and Pd catalysts. Further, previous studies found that Cu exhibited low activity for alkyne hydrogenation [65,66]. The selectivity (13.0 kJ∙mol−1) and activity (1.00 × 10−2 s−1∙site−1) of C2H4 formation on Cu catalyst at 425 K are much lower than those on Pd1Cu3 IMCs [67]. Moreover, PdCu(111) alloy surface doped by the single-atom Pd displays C2H4 selectivity of 39.8 kJ∙mol−1, which is still much lower than that on Pd1Cu3 IMCs [30]; meanwhile, PdCu(211) alloy surface doped by the single-atom Pd shows C2H4 formation activity of 1.58 × 104 s−1∙site−1 and its selectivity of 36.4 kJ∙mol−1 in C2H2 selective hydrogenation [60], however, both are still much lower than those on Pd1Cu3 IMCs catalyst in this study. Further, Wang et al. [68] studied C2H2 selective hydrogenation over the anatase and rutile supported Pd4 cluster and found that the anatase one has higher C2H4 selectivity than the rutile one due to the easier C2H4 desorption and higher activation barriers of C2H4 hydrogenation. Guan et al. [69] investigated C2H2 selective hydrogenation over the supported Pd and Cu cluster with different supports, suggesting that the oxygen-vacancy anatase supported Pd19 cluster is the most favorable for gaseous C2H4 formation, but the activity (6.19 × 105 s−1∙site−1) is still much lower than that of Pd1Cu3 IMCs in our study. Meng et al. [57] reported C2H2 selective hydrogenation over the oxygen defective anatase supported Pd4 and PdaAgb(a + b = 4) clusters, indicating that the supported Pd3Ag cluster displays the highest C2H4 selectivity (103.2 kJ∙mol−1), which is still lower than that of Pd1Cu3 IMCs in our study. Therefore, Pd1Cu3 IMCs in this study is more favorable for C2H4 formation to remove traces C2H2 in comparison with the single Pd, Cu, the single-atom Pd-doped Cu alloy and the supported catalysts, which is attributed to well-defined surface atomic arrangement. 3.4.2 The influences of partner metal ratio and type on green oil production Since the production of green oil can block active centers and deactivate the catalyst in C2H2 selective hydrogenation, we further analyze the production of green oil over the CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs screened out based on better activity and selectivity toward C2H4 formation in comparison with Pd catalyst. For the CuxMy IMCs, the production of green oil on five types of Cu3Zn1, Cu1Pt1, Cu3Ni1, Cu3Pd1 and Cu3Ag1 catalysts is investigated (see Fig. S15). On Cu3Zn1, see Fig. S15a, compared to the routes of C2H2+C2H2 (212.9 kJ·mol−1) and C2H2+C2H3 (238.9 kJ·mol−1), the route of C2H3+C2H3 to produce 1,3-butadiene is the most advantageous in kinetics (141.7 kJ·mol−1). The same thing also occurs on the Cu3Pd1, Cu3Ag1, Cu1Pt1 and Cu3Ni1 (see Figs. S15b~S15e). Further, as presented in Fig. 7 , the route of C2H3+C2H3 to 1,3-butadiene is much easier in kinetics than C2H4 desorption route on the Cu1Pt1 (74.2 vs. 76.7 kJ·mol−1) and Cu3Ni1 (23.9 vs. 32.8 kJ·mol−1), respectively. However, C2H4 desorption route is much easier in kinetics than the route of C2H3+C2H3 to 1,3-butadiene on the Cu3Zn1 (98.5 vs. 174.6 kJ·mol−1), Cu3Pd1 (46.2 vs. 61.9 kJ·mol−1) and Cu3Ag1 (102.7 vs. 162.2 kJ·mol−1). Thus, green oil is easily produced on the Cu1Pt1 and Cu3Ni1, whereas Cu3Zn1, Cu3Pd1 and Cu3Ag1 can validly suppress green oil production. For the PdxNy IMCs, six types of Pd1Cu3, Pd1Au1, Pd3Au1, Pd1Ag1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs catalysts can greatly improve C2H4 formation activity and selectivity in comparison with that on Pd catalyst, since C2H4 formation activity and selectivity on Pd1Au1 is better than Pd3Au1, only Pd1Au1 is considered. The results on five types of Pd1Zn1, Pd1In1, Pd1Ag1, Pd1Cu3 and Pd1Au1 catalysts (see Fig. S16) indicate that the route of C2H3+C2H3 to produce 1,3-butadiene is the most advantageous on the Pd1Zn1, Pd1Cu3, Pd1Ag1 and Pd1Au1, while the route of C2H2+C2H3 is the most favorable on Pd1In1. Further, as shown in Fig. 7, the route of C2H3+C2H3 to 1,3-butadiene is difficult in kinetics compared to C2H4 desorption route on the Pd1Zn1 (176.4 vs. 56.3 kJ·mol−1), Pd1In1 (148.6 vs. 59.5 kJ·mol−1) and Pd1Cu3 (61.9 vs. 46.2 kJ·mol−1); however, it is opposite on the Pd1Ag1 (45.0 vs. 67.6 kJ·mol−1) and Pd1Au1 (39.0 vs. 59.8 kJ·mol−1). Hence, green oil production can be inhibited on the Pd1Zn1, Pd1In1 and Pd1Cu3 IMCs catalysts. Based on above results for CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs, it is obtained that compared to Pd catalyst, five types of Cu3Zn1, Cu3Pd1, Cu3Ag1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs catalysts not only possess better C2H4 formation selectivity and activity, but also hinder green oil formation among the considered CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs catalysts. 3.4.3 The influences of partner metal ratio and type on H2 dissociation Since H2 dissociation is the key step of C2H2 selective hydrogenation, the adsorption and dissociation of H2 on above five types of CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs including Cu3Zn1, Cu3Pd1, Cu3Ag1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs were further investigated (see Figs. S17 and S18), which have better C2H4 formation activity and selectivity and the suppression ability toward the production of green oil compared to Pd catalyst. The results show that H2 dissociative adsorption proceeds spontaneously on Cu3Pd1 IMCs catalyst (see Fig. S17). However, H2 molecular adsorption occurs on the Cu3Zn1, Cu3Ag1, Pd1In1 and Pd1Zn1 IMCs, correspondingly, H2 dissociation barriers are 95.6, 113.5, 60.2 and 24.3 kJ∙mol−1, see Fig. S18, namely, the dissociation of H2 into H atom also easily occurs on the latter two IMCs. Therefore, three types of Cu3Pd1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs catalysts can provide abundant hydrogen source to participate into C2H2 hydrogenation, especially, Cu3Pd1. In addition, H2 dissociation is easy on the three-layer p(3 × 3) (111) surface of Cu3Pd1 IMCs [49]. Zhou et al. [20] experimentally and theoretically showed that PdZn IMCs promote H2 dissociation. 3.4.4 The influences of partner metal ratio and type on surface structure Taking C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, the suppression of green oil and H2 dissociation activity on the CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs into consideration, the surface structures for three types of Cu3Pd1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs with better performance are analyzed. As shown in Fig. 8 , it is obtained that only three types of Pd1Zn1, Pd1In1 and Cu3Pd1 IMCs with the surface isolated single-atom Pd active centers can facilitate the reaction of C2H2+2H→C2H4. Meanwhile, the Pd1Ag3, Pd1Au3 and Pd1Ga1 IMCs also have the surface isolated single-atom Pd active centers, however, the close adsorption energies between C2H2 and C2H4 on the Pd1Ag3 and Pd1Au3 leads to poor catalytic performance, the low C2H4 formation activity limits C2H4 production on Pd1Ga1. Thus, different partner metal ratios and types alter surface structure of catalysts, and affect catalytic performance toward the reaction of C2H2+2H→C2H4. In addition, theoretical studies showed that PdCu3 IMCs with three-layer model enables high C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, and limits green oil production at 400 K [49]. Zhou et al. [20] experimentally and theoretically showed that PdZn IMCs is highly selective and active for C2H4 formation, however, the green oil production is not considered. Feng et al. [6] experimentally and theoretically indicated that Pd1In1 IMCs with the single-atom Pd active centers displays superior C2H4 selectivity without considering green oil production. Therefore, among all considered CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs catalysts in this study, Cu3Pd1 IMCs with the surface isolated single-atom Pd active centers, namely, Pd1Cu3 IMCs catalyst, is the best choice for C2H2 selective hydrogenation, which not only exhibits high C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, but also inhibits green oil production and provides abundant hydrogen source for C2H2 selective hydrogenation. More importantly, Pd1Cu3 IMCs reduces the use of precious metal Pd compared to the widely used Pd-based catalysts. In addition, the defective nanodiamond-graphene catalyst supported the single-atom Pd presents high C2H4 selectivity [17]. Wei et al. [16] showed that the single-atom Pd fixed on the defects of nitrogen-doped carbon enables better C2H4 formation activity and selectivity. 3.4.5 The analysis of electronic properties Aiming at further clarifying the roles of partner metal ratio and type in the CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs, the projected density of states for the d-orbitals of the outermost atoms of CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs facilitating C2H4 formation are analyzed. For the CuxMy IMCs, CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt and Ni) is considered, as presented in Fig. 9 a, the distance between the d-band center and Femi level follows the order: Cu3Zn1 (-3.71 eV)<Cu1Zn1 (-4.90 eV), Cu1Pt1 (-2.12 eV)<Cu3Pt1 (-2.15 eV)< Cu1Pt3 (-2.30 eV) and Cu3Ni1 (-1.09 eV)<Cu1Ni1 (-1.99 eV), suggesting that Cu3Zn1 catalyst with d-band center closer to Fermi level has superior activity than Cu1Zn1, the same things also occur on the CuxPty and CuxNiy IMCs. For the PdxNy IMCs, as presented in Fig. 9b, PdxNy(N = Ag, In, Cu and Au) is considered, the d-band center deviates the farthest from the Fermi level on the Pd1Ag3 and Pd1Au3 (-3.15 and -2.79 eV) catalysts without C2H4 production. For PdxIny, Pd1In1 catalyst with d-band center far away from the Fermi level has superior catalytic activity than Pd3In1 (-2.51 and -2.00 eV). The same things also occur on the PdxCuy with the order of Pd1Cu3 (-2.11 eV)>Pd1Cu1 (-1.89 eV)>Pd3Cu1 (-1.88 eV), PdxAgy with the order of Pd1Ag1 (-2.53 eV)>Pd3Ag1 (-2.15 eV) and PdxAuy with the order of Pd1Au1 (-2.39 eV)>Pd3Au1 (-2.09 eV), suggesting that PdxNy(N = Ag, In, Cu and Au) with the d-band center far away from the Fermi level have better catalytic activity for C2H2 selective hydrogenation. Zhao et al. [61] showed that Cu catalyst displays better C2H4 formation activity with the d-band center far away from the Fermi level. Above results show that the different partner metal ratios of CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt and Ni) and PdxNy(N = Ag, In, Cu and Au) IMCs can alter the location of d-band center, and further influence C2H4 formation activity. On the other hand, as presented in Section 3.4.4, taking C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, the suppression of green oil and H2 dissociation activity over the CuxMy or PdxNy into consideration, among them, three types of Cu3Pd1, Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1 IMCs are the best choice for C2H2 selective hydrogenation to C2H4, especially, Cu3Pd1; Further, Cu3Pd1 IMCs with the d-band center closer to the Fermi level possesses the highest C2H4 formation activity. Thus, different partner metal types of CuxMy or PdxNy IMCs can also change the location of d-band center, and further influence C2H4 formation activity. 3.4.6 Catalytic performance comparisons between Cu3Pd1 IMCs and the previously reported catalysts In order to further explain outstanding selectivity and activity of Cu3Pd1 IMCs with surface Pd single-atom, the comparisons about C2H4 formation activity and selectivity between Cu3Pd1 IMCs and previously reported catalysts were performed. As presented in Fig. 10 a, our results showed that on Cu3Pd1, C2H4 selectivity is 122.3 kJ·mol−1, and the activation barriers of C2H2+H→C2H3 and C2H3+H→C2H4 are 51.0 and 46.2 kJ·mol−1, respectively; the overall barrier of C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4 is 51.0 kJ·mol−1. Pd1Zn1 has C2H4 selectivity (83.6 kJ∙mol−1), and the activation barriers of C2H2+H→C2H3 and C2H3+H→C2H4 are 102.0 and 56.3 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Pd1In1 corresponding to the surface single-atom Pd as the active centers displays high C2H4 selectivity (217.0 kJ·mol−1), and the activation barriers of C2H2+H→C2H3 and C2H3+H→C2H4 are 102.8 and 59.5 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Thus, in this study, compared to Pd1Zn1 and Pd1In1, the Cu3Pd1 has higher C2H4 formation activity and potential C2H4 selectivity. As presented in Fig. 10b, for the surface alloys doped by Pd single-atom, Zhang et al. [59,60] found that C2H4 selectivity is 42.6 and 36.4 kJˑmol−1 on the PdCu(111) and PdCu(211) doped by Pd single-atom, respectively; the overall barriers of C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4 are 47.5 and 78.8 kJˑmol−1, respectively. However, ethane formation is easy on Pd-doped Cu2O(111). In addition, ethane is easily formed on the single-atom Pd-doped Cu13, Cu38 or Cu55 clusters in C2H2 selective hydrogenation [70]. C2H4 is easily over-hydrogenated to generate ethane on the PdAg(111) doped by Pd single-atom [71] and Pd1M@Pd(111)(M = Cu, Au and Ag) [8]. Hence, the alloy surfaces doped by Pd single-atom as reported above still present lower C2H4 formation activity and selectivity compared to Cu3Pd1 in this study. As presented in Fig. 10c, C2H4 selectivity over the stable catalyst with Pd single-atom fixed on the defects of nitrogen-doped carbon is 91.0 kJ·mol−1, and the overall barrier of C2H2+2H→C2H4 is 94.0 kJ·mol−1 [16]. The catalyst with Pd single-atom dispersed onto the defective nanodiamond-graphene has C2H4 selectivity of 51.0 kJ·mol−1, and the overall barriers of C2H2+2H→C2H4 is 110.0 kJ·mol−1 [17]. The catalyst with the atom-dispersed Pd onto nitrogen-doped graphene has C2H4 selectivity of 88.0 kJ·mol−1 [72]. Pd1/SVG catalyst with Pd single-atom supported by a single vacancy graphene facilitates ethane formation [73]. Interestingly, Pd1/GDY catalyst with Pd single-atom supported on the graphdiyne presents significantly high C2H4 selectivity (261.4 kJ·mol−1) with the overall barriers of 38.4 kJ·mol−1 for C2H4 formation [73]. As a result, except for Pd1/GDY catalyst, the other supported single-atom Pd catalysts mentioned above still exhibit lower activity and selectivity toward C2H4 formation compared to Cu3Pd1 IMCs in this study. Moreover, although Pd1/GDY catalyst presents better C2H4 selectivity and formation activity than Cu3Pd1 IMCs, Cu3Pd1 IMCs with ordered atomic arrangement and structural characteristics presents stronger thermal stability than the single-atom Pd1/GDY catalyst. Thus, the Cu3Pd1 or Pd1Cu3 may become a promising catalyst in C2H2 selective hydrogenation, which not only presents the industrially practical C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, but also possesses outstanding thermal stability."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, aiming at reveal the most suitable partner metal type and ratio among the CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs and further screen out the most suitable IMCs with excellent catalytic performance for C2H2 selective hydrogenation, density functional theory calculations were performed to systematically investigate the underlying mechanism of C2H2 selective hydrogenation on the different types of CuxMy(M = Zn, Pt, Ni, Pd, Au and Ag) or PdxNy(N = Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Cu, Ag and Au) IMCs catalyst. This study examined the influences of the partner metal ratio and type in the CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs on the four key factors of C2H2 selective hydrogenation, including C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, green oil production and H2 dissociation activity. Taking above four factors into account, the results reveal that either Cu3Pd1 or Pd1Cu3 IMCs with the surface isolated single-atom Pd anchored into IMCs bulk performed as active centers should be the most suitable intermetallic compound among the CuxMy and PdxNy IMCs, which presents the industrially practical performance for C2H4 formation in comparison with the previously reported single-atom Pd catalysts in experimental and theoretical studies. The excellent performance of Cu3Pd1 IMCs catalyst for C2H4 formation is attributed to the unique surface structures and electronic properties. Meanwhile, compared to the widely used Pd-based catalysts, the Cu3Pd1 or Pd1Cu3 IMCs with the surface isolated single-atom Pd catalyst not only reduces the cost of catalysts with the non-noble metal Cu as the main body, but also maximizes the utilization of noble metal Pd. This study provides valuable information for the design and screening out of intermetallic compound catalysts in selective hydrogenation of alkynes."
