0,Introduction,"CO2 emissions are increasing with the development of industrialization, leading to global warming, sea-level rise, and other serious hazards. The “Global Carbon Budget” reported that global CO2 emissions had increased yearly. The global CO2 emissions are expected to exceed 40 billion tons in 2030. Therefore, the full and effective use of CO2 resources has always been an urgent problem. The use of CO2 resources to produce fuels, precious chemicals, or materials can reduce CO2 emissions and decrease the dependence on fossil resources. At present, the application of CO2 is mainly focused on cycloaddition to produce cyclic carbonate [1-6] and hydrogenation to produce formic acid (FA) [7-16], alcohol [17-19], and other hydrocarbons [20,21]. Among these chemicals, FA is widely used in rubber, medicine, dyes, and leather industries. Thus, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to produce FA is an atomic-economic reaction, which is worthy of further studying [22-24]. Due to the high chemical stability of CO2, how to realize the rapid activation of CO2 is the key to realize its low energy consumption utilization, and the design of catalyst is the core to the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. The design of high-efficiency catalysts is mainly considered from the perspective of high active centers and suitable supports. Commonly used high-activity centers mainly include precious metals (i.e., Ir [22], Ru [25], Ag [15], and Pd [26]), while carriers usually include oxides (i.e., TiO2 [10], ZrO2 [27], and CeO2 [28]), carbides (i.e., amine-functionalized carbon [29], g-C3N4 [30]), and polymers (i.e., amino polymers/polyamines [31], poly(ionic liquid)s [32] (PILs)). Many hydrogenation catalysts can be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Recovering and recycling homogeneous catalysts are difficult despite their extensive application in the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. Heterogeneous catalysts with advantages in product separation and catalyst recovery have attracted extensive attention from researchers [31]. Among these catalysts, palladium-based (Pd-based) catalysts have been widely used as the active centers of heterogeneous catalysts due to their unique capability to adsorb and dissociate hydrogen. Yan et al. [27] prepared a series of Pd-based catalysts with Pd nanoparticles supported on ZrO2 −M, ZrO2 −M&T, and ZrO2-T, which showed the unique catalytic performance during the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. The 2%Pd/ZrO2-T catalyst afforded the highest activity with turnover frequency (TOF) approximately 0.83 s −1 under conditions of 2 MPa CO2 and 2 MPa H2 at 100 °C. Gift Mehlana et al. [33] reported using activated MOFs to synthesize two kinds of catalysts, namely Pd@Mg:JMS-2a and Pd@Mn:JMS-2a, which were utilized in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. Their results revealed that the turn-over-numbers (TONs) of FA using Pd@Mg:JMS-2a and Pd@Mn:JMS-2a were respectively as high as 2.02 and 2.72 s −1 under the optimal conditions. PILs with a polymeric backbone formed from ionic liquids (ILs) species have been recently widely used as supports and stabilizers for NPs in catalytic reactions [34-36]. Moreover, PILs polymerized by the ionic thermal synthesis method are an effective carrier for the heterogeneous catalyst [37]. The resulting PILs are characterized as follows: many kinds of precursors, easy synthesis, good pore performance structure, modifiability, large specific surface area, adjustable pore size distribution, small specific gravity, and good thermal and chemical stability. Thus, PILs have a considerable application prospect in actual industrial production. Meanwhile, PILs can improve their catalytic activity by changing the electronic state of Pd NPs. For instance, Zhang et al. [38] reported the experiment of CO2 hydrogenation on Pd/C in an alkali-free IL [Bmim][OAc] under mild conditions to generate free FA, and the concentration of free FA in the system could obtain as high as 5.20 mmol/L. Dupont et al. [39] reported the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to FA combining an ionic liquid and the precursor [Ru3(CO)12], and the concentration of obtained FA solution could reach up to 1.2 M. However, the currently reported heterogeneous catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 still have problems, such as relatively low activity and limited chemical design. Therefore, developing a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to FA is still necessary. Given previous research, a series of novel dicationic PILs are designed as follows. First, [Bmim]Br as a solvent and the functional ILs containing vinyl groups as monomers were synthesized. Subsequently, dicationic PILs were prepared via ionic thermal polymerization. Then, PILs with hydrophobic anion ([Tf2N−]) were obtained by ion exchange. Finally, the Pd-based catalysts with Pd supported on the PILs were received, and their catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation in sodium borohydride aqueous solution was studied. The results manifested that 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N showed the best catalytic performance in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction under the same conditions and obtained 2.19 mmol FA and TOF as high as 13.32 s − 1 under the conditions of 80 °C, 1 h, 2 MPa pressure of CO2, and 0.88 M sodium borohydride aqueous solution."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 1-vinylimidazole (99%), 1-methylimidazole (99%), 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (99%), 4,4′-bis(bromomethyl)biphenyl (99%), n-butane bromide (98%), azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 98%), lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTf2N) (98%), and palladium chloride (PdCl2) were purchased from Aladdin Internet Reagent Database Inc. (Shanghai, China). Other reagents, such as sodium borohydride, hydrochloric acid, acetonitrile, ether, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The synthesis of 1‑butyl‑3-methylimidazole bromide ([Bmim]Br) was described in supporting information (Fig. S1)."
3,Synthesis of bis-vinylimidazolium salt,"2.2 Synthesis of bis-vinylimidazolium salt 1-vinylimidazole (0.49 g, 5.31 mmol) and 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (0.69 g, 2.65 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL DMSO. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the reaction, the product was precipitated by adding ether to the reaction solution. The powder was collected and washed with ethyl acetate until the unreacted substrate was removed. Then, it was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain a white powder product IL-1. The obtained product was named [Bbvim]Br2. [Bbvim]Br2 yield: 95%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO, TMS) δ (ppm) = 9.74 (s, 1H), 8.25 (s, 1H), 7.96 (s, 1H), 7.56 (s, 2H), 7.35 (q, J = 6.9 Hz, 1H), 6.00 (dd, J = 12.5, 1.7 Hz, 1H), 5.51 (s, 2H), 5.46 (dd, J = 7.0, 1.6 Hz, 1H). (Fig. S2) By the same method, only 4,4′-bis(bromomethyl)biphenyl was used instead of 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene to obtain IL-2, which named [Bpvim]Br2. [Bpvim]Br2 yield: 96%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO, TMS) δ (ppm) = 10.03 (s, 1H), 8.33 (s, 1H), 8.08 (s, 1H), 7.75 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 2H), 7.63 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (q, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 6.05 (dd, J = 12.6, 1.8 Hz, 1H), 5.59 (s, 2H), 5.43 (dd, J = 7.0, 1.8 Hz, 1H). (Fig. S3)"
4,Synthesis of hydrophobic anionic poly(ionic liquid) materials,"2.3 Synthesis of hydrophobic anionic poly(ionic liquid) materials The synthesis method of PIL was polymerized according to the ionic thermal synthesis method reported in the literature [37]. Typically, [Bmim]Br (6 g), H2O (0.75 g), AIBN (0.03 g, 10 wt%, based on the amount of IL) were placed in a round bottom flask, then added [Bbvim]Br2 (0.3 g). The above mixture was magnetically stirred at room temperature until homogeneous and transparent solution was achieved. Then the polymerization reacted in an oil bath under atmospheric pressure at 100 °C for 24 h, and finally washed with deionized water and under vacuum dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The obtained product was denoted as PIL-1-Br. PIL-2-Br was obtained by the same method. PIL-1-Br (0.3 g) or (PIL-2-Br) was weighed and placed in a round bottom flask, then a certain amount of LiTf2N (0.32 g) was added according to the ion site, and deionized water (10 mL) was added, stirred at room temperature for 12 h. After the exchange, the filtrate was removed by centrifuge, and the product was dried under vacuum at 80 °C, namely PIL-1-Tf2N (or PIL-2-Tf2N)."
5,Preparation of supported Pd NPs catalyst,"2.4 Preparation of supported Pd NPs catalyst First, an aqueous solution (0.04 M) of H2PdCl4 was prepared from PdCl2 and HCl (36 wt%). Then, in a round-bottom bottle, PIL-1-Tf2N (0.5 g) was weighed. Then acetonitrile (10 mL) was added into the bottle, and added prepared H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (1.17 mL). The mixture was subjected to an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for a few minutes, followed by magnetic stirring for 24 h. The Pd/PIL-1-Tf2N catalyst was prepared by centrifugation and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, it was reduced with NaBH4 aqueous solution (25 mL). The obtained catalyst could be denoted as 1%Pd/PIL-1-Tf2N catalyst. The same method was used to prepare 0.5%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, 2%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, and 1% Pd/PIL-2-Br. Table 1 listed the ICP-OES results for various Pd contents."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations Scanning electron microscope (SEM) of Hitachi S4800 was used to scan the surface of the sample to observe the surface morphology of the sample. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) model JEOL JEM-2100F was observed the pore structure of the sample and the size of the nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the Quantum 2000 scanning ESCA microprobe (physical electron) using Al Kα radiation (1846.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The C 1 s peak at 284.5 eV was used as a reference for binding energy. A Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer was applied to record Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. At room temperature, using DMSO as the deuterium reagent, the 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the samples were tested using a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz instrument. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed using SDT Q600 instrument in dry air at a rate of 10 °C•min−1. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using ASAP 2020 vol adsorption analyzer with N2 purity of 99.998%. Before the adsorption measurement, the sample was degassed at 120 °C for 10 h. The metal content in the catalyst was determined by iCAP 6000 series inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The catalyst was digested in aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 = 3:1) at room temperature for 4 h, and then diluted with deionized water to a certain volume before analysis. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) formula was employed to calculate the specific surface area in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05 to 0.2. The pore size distribution curve was obtained by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. The CO pulse experiment was operated on AutoChem II 2920 device to determine the dispersion of metals on the support."
7,Hydrogenation of CO2 to FA,"2.6 Hydrogenation of CO2 to FA The reaction was carried out in a high-pressure stainless steel autoclave. In a typical operation, catalyst (20 mg) was added to the batch reactor. NaBH4 (100 mg) was added as hydrogen donor and deionized water (3 mL) was added as solvent, and pressurized to the required pressure with CO2. Subsequently, the reactor was moved to an oil bath at the set temperature (80 °C) and magnetically stirred for 1 h. After the reaction was completed, the reactor was cooled to room temperature with water, and then the excess pressure was released to the environment. The liquid reaction solution was quantitatively analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy with acetone as the internal standard. To check the reusability of the catalyst, the recovered catalyst was washed several times with distilled water, dried under vacuum, and then subjected to multiple catalytic cycles."

9,Results and discussions,
10,Synthesis and characterization of the Pd/PIL catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the Pd/PIL catalysts The synthesis of the PIL depends on the free radical self-polymerization of the bis-vinylimidazolium salt monomer and uses [Bmim]Br as a solvent, that is, ionothermal synthesis. The advantage of this synthesis method is that it does not require the addition of additional templates and volatile organic solvents and its synthesis under environmental pressure. Furthermore, the IL solvent can be recycled [37]. PILs with double cations and halogen anions are successfully prepared in the current study by ionothermal synthesis, and MPILs with hydrophobic anions are prepared by ion exchange. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis steps. The bis-vinylimidazolium salt monomer and AIBN are dissolved in an IL solvent and self-polymerized at 100 °C for 24 h. Moreover, a small amount of water can be added as a co-solvent if necessary. Herein, two bis-vinylimidazolium salt monomers are designed and investigated, as shown in Scheme 2 A and B. The result reveals that the bis-vinylimidazolium salt has been successfully polymerized by FT-IR. Finally, palladium based catalysts are obtained by loading palladium on the prepared polymers. The further characterization and catalytic experiment results show that the nitrogen element in the ionic liquid polymer can play an anchoring, good dispersion and stabilization effect on palladium nanoparticles. Fig. 1 shows the infrared spectra of monomers and PILs. The monomer at 3069 cm−1 attributable to the unsaturated CH stretching vibration on the vinyl has a sharp peak. However, this peak is absent in the infrared spectrum of the polymer, which indicates the occurrence of the polymerization reaction. Besides, the bands observed around 920 cm−1 on the spectra are ascribed to the unsaturated CH vibrations of vinyl groups. However, these bands disappeared on the spectrum of the PIL, which suggests the occurrence of polymerization. The bands at 1647 and 1568 cm−1 are due to the stretching vibration of the imidazole ring skeleton [35]. In addition, a sharp broad peak between 1200 and 1500 cm−1 can be observed in the spectrum of the polymer, which can be attributed to the peak of the anion [Tf2N−] [40], indicating a successful ion exchange. FT-IR spectra of IL-1 and PIL-1-Br and FT-IR spectra of IL-2 and PIL-2-Br are shown in Fig. S4 and Fig. S5, respectively. The porous characteristics of the sample obtained at 77 K were analyzed by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the N2 adsorption isotherm represents a slow absorption under low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.3) and a continuous increase in absorption under high relative pressure (0.3 < P/P0 < 0.9). This isotherm is a type IV reflecting the mesoporous structure [41]. This finding is further indicated by the pore size distribution curve in Fig. 2B. The sample shows abundant mesoporous structures with a porous diameter of approximately 10–20 nm. The SEM images of the samples at different sizes are shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3A shows that the whole morphology of the prepared catalyst is blocky, the edges are not smooth, and the layered structure is not obvious, indicating that the catalyst may have a spatial network structure. The element distribution images of the sample under the SEM (Fig. 3C–H) show the uniform dispersion of six elements of C, F, N, O, Pd, and S in the entire framework. As shown in Fig. 3G, we can see that the Pd element is dispersed on the whole area. The probable reason is that the samples are ultrasonically dispersed in the ethanol solvent before the test, forming a distribution of small particles. TG is used to study the thermal stability of the synthesized polymer and the catalyst loaded with Pd. Fig. S6 shows that the support and supported Pd catalyst have high thermal stability. The initial decomposition temperature is higher than 290 °C, which is far larger than the maximum temperature of 120 °C used in the catalytic experiment. Fig. 4 shows the TEM image of the 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N catalyst and the particle size distribution graph at a size of 20 nm. Fig. 4A–B show the even distribution of small Pd nanoparticles on the polymers. The average particle size distribution of Pd is 3.6 ± 0.9 nm (Fig. 4D). Their corresponding TEM images (Fig. 4C) show the 2.20 Å lattice fringes of these particles, which are in good agreement with the spacing of the Pd{111} crystal planes, indicating the existence of Pd as a metal [28]. The chemical state of the elements in the entire material is evaluated by XPS analysis. Fig. 5 shows that the XPS spectra of N 1 s and Pd 3d for Pd supported on polymers are corrected at 284.5 eV based on C 1 s. Literature reports indicate that if Pd transfers electrons to the carrier, then the binding energy (BE) of Pd is transferred to high energy; conversely, the binding energy of Pd is transferred to low energy [42]. The Pd 3d XPS spectrum in Fig. 5 concludes the presence of metallic (335 eV) and oxidized Pd (337 eV) in the Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N catalysts [43], indicating that the well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles on the support were obtained due to the existence of support-induced modification. The binding energies of Pd° for 0.5%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, and 2%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N are 335.19, 335.27, and 335.02 eV, respectively. Compared with the experimental results, the TOF of catalytic reaction will increase based on the binding energy of Pd0, and 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N has the highest binding energy. This result indicates that the Pd nanoparticles of 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N comprise an electron-deficient property. Reports indicate that the catalytic effect in the hydrogenation process is improved with the increase in Pd0 positive electricity [44], which is consistent with the experimental results. Meanwhile, among the three catalysts, the peak area ratio of Pd0 is 69:100:51, which is also consistent with the catalytic results obtained in this study (corresponding TOF values are 1.03, 13.32, and 8.30 s − 1). The results show that the catalytic effect is improved with the increase in Pd° content. However, the peak area ratio of Pd2+ is 51:100:51, which is inconsistent with the experimental results, indicating that Pd0 plays a leading role in the catalytic process. The N spectrum is also analyzed in XPS to further demonstrate the interaction between the metal and the carrier. The spectrum of N 1 s binding energy shows that the binding energy at 399.7 eV belongs to the C = N peak, while that at 401.5 eV belongs to the CN peak [45]. Considering the carrier polymer CN peak binding energy at 401.75 eV, 0.5%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, and 2%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N CN peak binding energies are 401.57, 401.28, and 401.41 eV, respectively. The change in nitrogen binding energy indicates that the binding energy of N 1 s decreases with the increase in Pd loading, while the binding energy of zero-valent Pd increases. This finding further proves that Pd transfers electrons to N when binding with support. Although 2%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N with a high loading capacity gains additional electrons, the XPS analysis of Pd 3d shows the worst electron deficiency of Pd compared to 0.5%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N and 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N. The possible reason is that the electron deficiency of Pd decreases on average for each Pd with the increase in Pd content despite the transfer of additional electrons by Pd to N as a whole. Moreover, the reduction in catalytic effect indicates that the electron deficiency of Pd plays an important role in the catalytic reaction."
11,Catalytic performance tests of the Pd/PIL catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance tests of the Pd/PIL catalysts According to literature reports, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to FA in an aqueous solution has a small negative free energy change (CO2 (aq) + H2 (aq) → HCOOH (aq), ΔG0 298 = −4 kJ/mol). Directly hydrogenating CO2 to FA in the gas phase (CO2 (g) + H2 (g) → HCOOH (g), ΔG0 298 = + 32.9 kJ/mol) is disadvantages considering the aforementioned thermodynamics. However, the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA (CO2 (aq) + H2 (aq) + B → HCO2 − (aq) + BH+ (B: base), ΔG0 298 = - 35.4 kJ/mol) easily proceeds under alkaline conditions (such as KOH, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3) mainly because of the decrease in activation energy in the reaction [46]. Therefore, various Pd catalysts are used in this study for CO2 hydrogenation in NaBH4 aqueous solution (pH = 10). Notably, the sodium borohydride solution in this study is used as a source of hydrogen donor in addition to being an alkaline additive. Studies have found that the use of effective catalysts can enhance the hydrogen supply capacity of borohydrides to CO2, which can substantially reduce the dosage and cost of borohydrides. The catalytic performance of the resultant Pd/PIL catalysts and other control samples was investigated in the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA in an aqueous solution. The results of the experiment are shown in Table 2 and Fig. S7. The effect of catalysts on CO2 hydrogenation reaction at different temperatures (Table 2, entries 3–6) was also compared. The TOF value first increased and then decreased with the increase in temperature when using sodium borohydride as an alkaline additive and hydrogen source and 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N as a catalyst at 80 °C and 2 MPa CO2 with a concentration of 0.88 M NaBH4 aqueous solution. A total of 2.19 mmol FA could be produced with the largest TOF (13.32 s − 1) at 80 °C. The amount of produced FA gradually decreased as the reaction temperature increased, indicating that high temperature was not conducive to the progress of CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, the migration of hydrogen on the carrier could be enhanced through the proton transfer in the form of hydronic ions or through the dissociation mechanism of H2O in the presence of water in the reaction system [47]. Subsequently, the effect of reaction time on catalysis was investigated. The result indicated that the amount of FA produced gradually increased with the extension of the reaction time, and 2.51 mmol FA could be produced within 2 h (Table 2, entries 7–9). Subsequently, the influence between the concentration of sodium borohydride aqueous solution and CO2 pressure was also studied. The result showed that the TOF value significantly increased with the sodium borohydride solution concentration (Table 2, entries 10–11) and slightly decreased with the increase in CO2 pressure (Table 2, entries 12–13). This finding indicated that a high concentration of sodium borohydride solution could produce additional hydrogen, and an increase in the partial pressure of hydrogen led to an increased FA. Meanwhile, the metal loading also affected the catalytic reaction. The catalytic performance of three different loadings of Pd catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA was compared (Table 2, entries 14–15). Notably, 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N catalyst could generate the most FA (2.19 mmol) and the highest TOF (13.32 s −1). This result showed that the activity of the catalyst would decrease when the content of Pd loading was considerably low. The content of Pd was substantially low, resulting in few catalytic active sites on the 0.5%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N sample, and the catalytic effect worsened. Synthetic 1%Pd/PIL-2-Br, where PIL-2-Br was a polymer with hydrophilic anions [Br−], was used for the comparative experiment to prove that the hydrophobic properties of [Tf2N−] inhibited the ion exchange between the formed formate and [Tf2N−], thus promoting the generation of additional free FA (Table 2, entry 16) [48,49]. The comparison showed that when using 1%Pd/PIL-2-Br catalyst to catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA, the amount of FA generated under the same reaction conditions was 1.42 mmol and the TOF was 7.07 s −1, which was lower than the catalytic effect of 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N catalyst (Table 2, entry 4). The important reason for the increase in the TOF of 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N might be that the hydrophobic anions on the catalyst surface accelerated the entry of bicarbonate and the removal of the formed formate from the catalyst surface. That is, the bicarbonate in the hydrogenation reaction could be enriched in 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N, thereby enhancing the activity. To be more specific, water was used as the solvent in this reaction system, and the obtained formate was free in the aqueous phase. The ion exchange could be occurred between bromide ion and formate because of their hydrophilicity. Some formate ions in the water phase will be taken away by the catalyst during the catalyst recovery process, causing the measured formate concentration to be lower than the actual concentration. On the contrary, Tf2N anions inhibited the ion exchange with formate due to its hydrophobicity. Once the formate was formed, it would be removed with the water so it could not take away more formate in the process of recovery of catalyst. Thus, the mass transfer rate was increased, leading to the increase of the reaction rate. And it couldn't take away formate in the process of recovery of catalyst. Therefore, 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N promoted the formation of more formate in the aqueous phase. A set of 1%Pd/PIL-1-Tf2N catalytic hydrogenation experiments were also conducted (Table 2, entry 17), and the result showed that the catalytic effect (the amount of formate was 1.76 mmol, the TOF was 3.37 s −1) was lower than that of 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N. The possible reason was the introduction of rigid structures to the polymer by the biphenyl in PIL, which could effectively hold up the pore to allow the active site to have increased contact with the substrate. A set of controlled experiment was conducted to prove the difference between direct hydrogenation of CO2 and hydrogenation of CO2 with a hydrogen donor (Table 2, entry 18). The amount of FA generated by direct CO2 hydrogenation was 1.81 mmol under the same catalytic conditions, and the TOF was 11.02 s −1, which was lower than the catalytic result of CO2 hydrogenation with a hydrogen donor. The possible reason was that the hydrogen was cleaved and activated on Pd by hemolysis in the process of direct CO2 hydrogenation [50], and its activation effect was lower than that of hydrogen on Pd and nitrogen by heterolysis [51]. In addition, the reaction time was extended to 8 h under other reaction conditions (Table 2, entry 19), and the amount of FA produced by the theoretical and actual reaction was compared. The result showed that the amount of FA produced by the actual reaction was 7.92 mmol, which was lower than that produced by the theoretical reaction (9.68 mmol). However, the FA content could reach 82% of the theoretical value. A 10%Pd/C catalyst was used to conduct two sets of control experiments under the same reaction conditions to highlight the advantages of using PIL as the carrier. Thus, the 10%Pd/C catalyst was under the reaction conditions of 80 °C and 100 °C, the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to FA produced 1.41 and 1.17 mmol, respectively, and the TOF values were 1.73 and 1.43 s −1, respectively (Table 2, entries 1–2), which was far lower than the catalytic effect of this experiment. The 10%Pd/C catalyst used in this paper was a commercial catalyst rather than a synthetic catalyst. Whether it's 10% loading or 1% loading, we used the same amount of palladium for the catalytic reaction. It was obvious that the amount of formic acid obtained by using 10% Pd/C was much lower than that of 1%Pd/PIL-2-TF2N. The TOF value obtained by us according to the calculation formula was also obvious that the TOF of 10% Pd/C was much lower than that of 1%Pd/PIL-2-TF2N, which indicated that the catalyst prepared by us was far better than the commercial catalyst. Finally, two blank controls were conducted. The results found that although the formation of FA could be detected when sodium borohydride was used as a hydrogen source (Table 2, entry 20), which was consistent with the previous report [52], the product was significantly increased after the addition of the catalyst. No FA was produced after the reaction with hydrogen as the hydrogen source in the absence of the catalyst (Table 2, entry 21). Table S1 listed the dispersions and TOFs of different catalysts under same conditions. A comparison table was also presented with the reported heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 to FA (Table S2). These results indicated that IL units comprising dications and hydrophobic anions [Tf2N−] in the PIL could uniformly disperse palladium nanoparticles and enhance the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to FA. As shown in Fig. 6 , the activity of the catalyst was almost unchanged when the 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N catalyst was recycled five times at 80 °C, 1 h, and with a concentration of 0.88 M NaBH4 aqueous solution. This result proved that the 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N had stable reusability. According to the ICP-OES calculation in Table 1, the Pd load of the catalyst before recycling (0.21%Pd) and the Pd loss in the filtrate after recycling (0.03%Pd) showed that almost no metal was leached from the catalyst after recycling. Simultaneously, the FT-IR (Fig. 7 ) and XPS (Fig. 8 ) spectra of the used catalyst are similar to those of the fresh catalyst, which indirectly indicate the stability of the catalyst in the cycle experiments."
12,The possible reaction mechanism,"3.3 The possible reaction mechanism The results and analysis of XPS revealed that the electrons transferred from Pd to N in 1%Pd/PIL-2-Tf2N when Pd NPs is loaded on the polymer surface. Electron transfer is the basis of the synergy between active ingredients. Pdδ+ with low electron cloud density and N − with high electron cloud density are formed due to this electron transfer. Combined with the experimental results, a possible hydrogen splitting mechanism is proposed in Scheme 3 . Based on some reports [53], Pd and N exist in the form of Pdδ+−N − at the connection point. The introduction of CO2 generates bicarbonate ions under alkaline conditions of sodium borohydride aqueous solution. Sodium borohydride was used as the hydrogen source in this experiment. Therefore, H − may be derived from hydride ions produced in aqueous sodium borohydride in the process of catalyzing the hydrogenation of bicarbonate, except for H2 activation at the binding site and decomposition into H + bound to N − and H − bound to Pdδ+. H − can be fixed on Pdδ+ by the opposite charge attraction because of the strong electronegativity O − in bicarbonate. H − then attacks the carbon atom attached to the bicarbonate, and H + attacks the O at the carbonyl position to form a glycol. The two hydroxyl groups will be dehydrated and condensed to form a carbonyl group owing to the unsteadiness of the double-chain diol. Thus, the bicarbonate becomes the formate. Finally, the catalyst is recovered from the substrate and transferred to the next cycle."
13,Conclusions,"Overall, dication PILs supported Pd NPs were designed as catalysts to hydrogenate CO2 into FA efficiently under mild conditions. The results suggest that the IL units obtained by combining dications and Tf2N anions have a highly dispersed effect on Pd-NPs, thereby improving the catalytic performance. Compared with other Pd-based catalysts reported, the designed catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity in alkaline media. At 80 °C and 2 MPa pressure of CO2 with a concentration of 0.88 M NaBH4 aqueous solution, the TOF values of 1 and 8 h are 13.32 and 6.03 s −1, respectively, and the highest FA amount can reach 82% of the theoretical value. In addition, recovering and reusing the catalyst in multiple cycles are easy, and no significant losses are observed while maintaining structural stability. The proposed mechanism further shows that the excellent catalyst performance is related to the strong metal-support interactions in the catalyst of PIL-supported Pd NPs. This finding provides a promising new catalyst for the formation of FA."
