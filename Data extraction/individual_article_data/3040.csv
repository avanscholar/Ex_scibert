0,Introduction,"Cobalt-based catalysts are the most used in Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS), due to their high activity and selectivity for long-chain hydrocarbon. Co-catalysts also present low activity in the Water-Gas Shift reaction (WGSR) [1]. Also, the structure and chemical configuration of the supports affect directly the catalytic properties [2]. Carbon nanomaterials, such as activated carbon [3], carbon spheres [4], carbon nanofibers [5], and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [6] have been investigated as supports for metal NPs, showing promising results towards CO hydrogenation. Recently, graphene has also been studied because of its remarkable properties and tunability in supporting a variety of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) in heterogeneous catalysts [2]. Ideally, graphene is a single-layer material, but graphene samples with two to ten layers have also been investigated [7]. Graphene possesses notable electronic, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Besides, its large specific surface area, low toxicity, and high adsorption capacity make graphene and its derivatives suitable as valuable substrates to interact with various species [8,9]. Catalytic properties of graphene nanocomposites supporting metal NPs are particularly of great interest due to the sp2 hybridization of carbon bonds in graphene and its electronic interaction with transition metals [10]. Apart from enhancing the properties of NPs, graphene also acts as a stabilizer for metal particles, preventing their agglomeration and sintering [8]. There are few works regarding Co/graphene catalyst for CO hydrogenation. Karimi and coworkers [1,11] investigated cobalt supported on graphene for low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The 15.0%Co/graphene catalyst presented high CO conversion and selectivity towards C5+ hydrocarbons, even though their graphene XRD results presented a high crystalline carbonic structure, suggesting the occurrence of graphite or multi-layered graphene. Even though the authors attributed the catalyst activity its good activity to the supposed electron donation of graphene to cobalt nanoparticles, that would promote the dissociative adsorption of CO molecules [11]. Other authors [12,13] also investigated Co/graphene catalysts for FTS, obtaining less expressive CO conversions than in the Karimi and coworkers' studies. The graphene or chemical produced graphene - also known as reduced Graphene Oxide, rGO - used in all cited works presented the same high crystalline profile. However, graphene's excellent electronic properties are only related to monolayered or few-layered graphene [14] and the XRD characterization results for cited studies presented multi-layered materials [7]. Thus, investigating the few-layered graphene role in supporting Co nanoparticles is needed for understanding its electronic effects during CO hydrogenation reactions. In this work, we prepared few-layered graphene or reduced graphene oxide (rGO), impregnated with cobalt nanoparticles, and studied the support influence on CO hydrogenation. Reduced graphene oxide was synthesized by the Improved Hummers (Tour’s) method [15] with important modifications. The precipitation-deposition method in alcoholic solution was used to anchor Co NPs while preventing rGO sheets restacking. The Co/rGO catalyst was characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, and TEM to study its morphology and the interaction of Co NPs with the support. Therefore, we used in situ spectroscopic analyses and post-reaction characterization techniques, investigating the impacts of metal-support electronic interaction in the proposed reaction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Natural graphite flake (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and H2SO4 (97.0%) (Vetec), H3PO4 (85% (Vetec); KMnO4 (99.3%) (Synth); NH4OH (25%), precursors, and H2O2 (35%) (Synth) HCl (36.5%), (Vetec), C2H5OH (PA) (Sigma-Aldrich) reactants were purchased. All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without any further purification."
3,Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) and Co/rGO composite,"2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) and Co/rGO composite Reduced graphene oxide was prepared by a three-step procedure: graphite oxidation, expansion and reduction. Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized by a methodology based on Hummer’s – Tour’s method [15]. Graphite flakes (3 g, Sigma-Aldrich) were oxidized with H2SO4 (360 mL), H3PO4 (40 mL) and KMnO4 (18 g), with reactants proportion of graphite: KMnO4 of 1:3 (w/w) and H2SO4: H3PO4 of 9:1 (v/v). The mixture was heated to 40 °C and stirred for 8 h. After reaction and 12 h overnight, the system was cooled to 10 °C and 30% H2O2 (3 mL, Synth) was added. Afterwards the suspension was centrifuged and washed fourfold with 250 mL of the following solvents: DI water, 30% HCl solution and ethanol (twice). Then, the solid was frozen at −80 °C and dried using a vacuum freeze dryer (Labconco FreeZone 4.5 Liter) for 24 h and grinded. GO powder was thermally reduced using a two-step procedure [16]. First, GO was expanded in a furnace at 300 °C in air and then reduced at 800° under Ar flux for 3 h to obtain the reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The catalyst was prepared with a 15.0% Co load (wt/wt) by a modified precipitation-deposition method at high pH value [17] using an alcoholic solution of Co(NO3).6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich). rGO was dispersed in a basic solution composed by ethanol and ammonium hydroxide (pH = 11). The precursor solution was slowly dripped in the basic suspension containing the support under stirring. Later the suspension was heated and stirred at 70 °C and the liquid media was evaporated. Then, the catalyst was dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h in Ar flux. The as synthesized catalyst was labeled 15Co/rGO."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku Miniflex X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a Cu tube (λ = 1.541 Å). Data were collected at 40 kV, 30 mA, in the range 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 90° with a step size of 0.05° and a count time of 2 s per step. The size of ordered crystalline domain (Lhkl) and inter-layer distance (dhkl) were calculated by Scherrer’s and Bragg equations, respectively. L hkl = 0.89 λ β cos θ d hkl = λ 2 sen θ where λ is the wave length of X-ray (0.154 nm) and β is the peak width at half height (radians). The number of layers (N) was also calculated based on the former equations, following a stablished method [18]: N = L hkl d hkl + 1 The Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were carried out at −196 °C, using a Quantacrome (Model NOVAwin 1200) equipment. The surface area was determined, according to the standard Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) and Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) methods. Volume and pore radius were determined by numerical integration of BJH method. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Fluorescence Spectroscopy was performed in a Shimadzu EDX-8000 spectrometer to evaluate the catalyst cobalt load. The measurement was taken using a 10 mm collimator and polypropylene sample cup. A TGA Q500 equipment was used to measure the weight changes of the sample by heating under N2 flow from 30 to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The reduction temperature of supported cobalt nanoparticles and their reduction degree were determined by Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis. 80 mg of the 15Co/rGO catalyst was placed in a U type reactor and the reduction procedure was made in two steps. First, the solid was dried at 100 °C for 30 min in He flux, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Then, the sample was cooled at room temperature and heated to 1000 °C (10 °C/min heating rate) under 30 mL/min H2/Ar flux. The outlet gases were analyzed using a Balzers-Pfeiffer mass spectrometer, especially the hydrogen (m/z = 2) and water (m/z = 18) signals. Raman spectroscopy analysis was carried out in a Renishaw InVia Reflex spectrometer, with CCD detector, 50X objective lens and laser length of 532 nm. The surface morphology was analyzed by High Resolution Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). The samples were dispersed in ethanol by sonication. The suspensions were dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The HRTEM images were taken by a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope, with maximum magnification of 1,500,000 times. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out for identifying the oxidation state of the cobalt nanoparticles on graphene sheets by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Model K-alpha + equipment. Temperature-Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) analysis was carried out in order to determine compounds distribution with increasing temperature, using a homemade unit coupled to a mass spectrometer (Balzers-Pfeiffer). The Co/rGO catalyst (0.050 g) was placed in a U type reactor and first reduced with H2 flux (30 mL/min) at 450 °C for 24 h. Afterward, switched to a reactant mixture flow of H2 and CO (2:1, 60 mL/min) and heated up to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and atmospheric pressure. FTIR analysis was performed in a Shimadzu IR-Prestige-21 spectrometer. Spectra data were collected between 400 and 4000 cm−1 with 1 cm−1 resolution. The sample (10.0 mg) was previously diluted in KBr. DRIFTS (Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) spectra were recorded on a spectrometer (Nicolet, model Nexus 470) equipped with a DRIFTS cell (Praynig Mantis, Harrick) for high temperature treatment and a zinc selenide (ZnSe) mirror assembly. The CO adsorption and CO + H2 in situ reaction spectra were obtained at different temperatures. These experiments were carried out after in situ reduction of the catalyst with 10%H2/Ar flow of 30 mL.min−1 up to 450 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to the reaction temperature. The CO adsorption process was performed using a 5.0% CO/Ar flux (40 mL.min−1) in a temperature range between 25 and 250 °C. After the procedure, the DRIFTS cell was cleaned for 30 min using Ar flux (30 mL.min−1). Then, syngas (32% CO, 64% H2, 4% Ar) was introduced at 60 mL/min in the cell. All spectra were obtained after an average of 64 scans from 650 to 4000 cm−1, with resolution of 40 cm−1 in presence of the gas-phase species at different temperatures. The outlet flow of CO + H2 in situ reaction was also analyzed using a mass spectrometer (Balzers-Pfeiffer). Reactants and products were monitored by tracking their mass fragments. Then, the relative selectivity of each product (i) was calculated by determining the relative area of the desired compound, dividing the compound area by the total area of the products or: Selectivity ( i ) % = Area ( i ) ∑ A r e a o f a l l p r o d u c t s × 100 %"
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test The catalytic test was performed in an automatized catalytic unit Microactivity-Efficient model MAE16110 (PID Eng&Tech Micromeritics®). The catalyst (0.150 g) was placed in a stainless steel fixed-bed tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 9 mm, at 1.8 MPa and 250 °C. The catalyst was previously reduced in situ with H2 flux (30 mL.min−1) at 450 °C for 15 h. The reactor was then cooled and pressurized to 1.8 MPa under syngas flow (molar ratio of H2: CO = 2:1) and mass space velocity of WHSV = 9600 cm3.gcat −1.h−1 and heated up to 250 °C. The gas flow was regulated by mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst). The outlet gas was analyzed by online gas chromatography equipped with two columns (Shimadzu GC-2010). The outlet sample injections were obtained every 2 h and the reaction was carried out during 48 h. The CO conversion (XCO) was calculated using following equation: X CO % = F C O i n l e t - F C O o u t l e t F C O i n l e t × 100 % Here, FCO(inlet) is the inlet CO molar flux and FCO(outlet) is the outlet CO molar flux."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology XRD patterns of synthesized materials are shown in Fig. 1 . The native graphite peak was found at 27°, corresponding to the reflection of its hexagonal structure. Its intensity is usually associated with the graphitization degree of carbon nanomaterials [19]. The GO peak, for (002) plane, was shifted to 2θ = 10° due to structural changes that occurred during the oxidation process [20]. The interlayer d-spacing (Table 1 ) expanded from 0.334 (graphite) to 0.876 nm (GO). This expansion was caused by oxygenated functions insertion in interlayer space and weakened the graphitic structure, enabling GO sheets exfoliation [16]. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) showed its diffraction peak at 2θ = 26° for the (002) plane, and it was less intense if compared to the GO sample. This less crystalline profile was expected after exfoliation and reduction processes [16,21], without any graphite residues. The calculated rGO d-spacing was 0.333 nm, similar to what was previously obtained for few-layered pristine graphene [22]. Furthermore, after exfoliation and reduction procedures, the rGO sample presented an average of two layers (N = 2) (see Table 2 ). The cobalt phase peaks of 15Co/rGO catalyst were found at 2θ at 36.3, 42.4, and 61.3°, and were assigned to the cubic structure of CoO (ICDD 48–1719). Noteworthy, the rGO peak was still present at 26°, confirming its stability even after cobalt oxide deposition. Importantly, we observed no graphene aggregates. The average CoO crystallite size was estimated by Scherrer’s equation and was 13 nm. However, the calculated average crystallite size of cubic CoO (Lhkl = 56 nm) is noticeable larger than that of 15Co/rGO (Table 1), which indicated that the deposition–precipitation method allowed obtaining small and well-dispersed nanoparticles. The textural and EDX results were presented in Table 3 . EDX analysis of the 15Co/rGO revealed that its metal content was different from the nominal load. This difference was attributed to the carbon mass loss during the calcination procedure. Graphite BET surface area was very low (6 m2.g−1), whereas the surface area of the oxide (GO) and the reduced oxide (rGO) were 59 and 494 m2.g−1, respectively. he increase in rGO surface area after GO reduction was related to the successful thermal exfoliation of graphene sheets [16,23,24]. 15Co/rGO sample surface area decreased to 294 m2/g, which indicated that the deposition of cobalt oxide nanoparticles covered the rGO surface area and blocked the pore volumes, according to previous works [1,11]. However, the 15Co/rGO catalyst presented a higher surface area than the reported values described in the literature for similar materials [1,13]. Likewise, the micropores in the synthesized material promoted a remarkable difference between BJH and BET surface measurements, as presented in Table 3, in agreement with the literature [25,26]. TGA analysis was performed to investigate the stability of graphene. Fig. 2 showed the mass loss profile of graphene and 15Co/rGO catalyst with increasing temperature during the heating process. There was a small mass loss event around 30 °C due to water removal and no significant carbon decomposition occurred up to 500 °C for both samples. Above 500 °C, the mass loss of rGO increased abruptly and continuously up to 900 °C. However less than 30% of the initial mass was degraded at 1000 °C. The mass loss between 200 and 400 °C is usually attributed to nitrate decomposition [27], and it was not observed for 15Co/rGO catalyst. Thus, the calcination process at 450 °C was efficient to remove the precursor residues. The phase transition from Co3O4 to Co° was confirmed by DTG peaks at 735 and 900°. These peaks could also be related to carbon thermal degradation [27,28]. These results were important for determining the oxide reduction temperature and for preventing the simultaneous decomposition of carbon. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was performed with pure H2 for the 15Co/rGO catalyst in the TPR unit, coupled to a mass spectrometer (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3 showed H2 consumption and H2O formation profiles with increasing temperature. The oxide reduction started at around 200 °C and exhibited two peaks for H2 and H2O profiles. Noticeably, no other peaks were observed up to 450 °C, such as CO and CO2 from graphene degradation. The shoulder at around 445 °C indicated a small decomposition of graphene, according to previous TGA results. The first peak occurred at 277 °C, assigned to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. The second broader peak at 350 °C was attributed to the second reduction step, i.e., the reduction of CoO to metallic Co°. The calculated reduction degree was 85.2%, and the main cobalt crystalline phase was CoO [29]. Previous studies of Co/graphene composites [1,11] reported higher reduction temperatures, at 370 and 525 °C, respectively, which coincide with the graphene degradation temperatures. In opposite, our results evidence that in this temperature range only the reduction of the cobalt oxide phases occurs, according to TGA results. Raman spectroscopy results are shown in Fig. 4 . D and G bands were identified at 1350 and 1585 cm−1, respectively. The D band indicates defects of the graphene sheets and staging disorder, while the G band is associated with the graphitic sp2 hybridization of hexagon-pinch mode [7,21,22]. The D/G intensity ratio changes are usually correlated to structural transformations on carbon materials. Hence, the increase of D band intensity after graphite oxidation was related to the insertion of oxygenated functions between graphite layers [30]. The calculated D/G intensity ratios were 0.80 for GO, 0.95 for rGO, and 0.87 for 15Co/rGO catalyst. The slight increase of D/G after cobalt deposition may be linked to graphene sheets restacking. The 15Co/rGO Raman spectrum peak assigned by (*) was associated with Co3O4 species [31]. Noteworthy, the deposition of cobalt nanoparticles has not decreased the D/G ratio, in opposition with earlier reported values in the literature [1,11,32]. This can be attributed to defects in thermally reduced graphene. These defects act as nucleation sites for cobalt NPs anchoring. We observed the presence of symmetric 2D at 2720 cm−1 and S3 bands at 2900 cm−1. According to Verma et al. (2016) [33], the 2D band is originated from the boundary of the bright zone phonon, while the S3 band is assigned to lattice disorders. The 2D band intensity decreased after the reduction of graphene oxide (GO), confirming the graphitic number of layers decrease [33,34]. The high-resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 5 ) showed the cobalt oxide nanoparticles deposited over the reduced graphene oxide surface. Furthermore, it showed the carbon phase and thin carbon layers on the rGO sample (Fig. 5A). The clear side indicates monolayered carbon planes and the dark regions contain two or more overlapping layers [21]. These results were in agreement with the XRD results previously presented in Table 1. Therefore, cobalt NPs deposition did not impact on graphene layered structure. Cobalt nanoparticles were well dispersed over the support surface (Fig. 5B). The interplanar distances of cobalt nanoparticles (Fig. 5C) were also calculated. Their values were correlated to the cubic CoO species, confirming XRD results. We concluded that the cobalt nanoparticles were well dispersed and linked to the rGO surface. The average diameter of the cobalt oxide nanoparticles, obtained by the particle size distribution, was 13 nm (Fig. 5D). No longer aggregates were observed. XPS screening survey spectrum (Fig. 6 A) revealed the elements at the catalyst surface. The carbon species of the reduced graphene oxide were also identified. The cobalt oxide phase was not reduced before the analysis. The profile was similar to previously reported ones [1,35]. Three main signals were shown in the XPS spectrum of the 15Co/rGO (Fig. 6A) sample after calcination: C1s, O1s, and Co2p. Nitrogen signal was also detected due to graphene functionalization by nitrate. These regions were analyzed and adjusted for identifying the bindings and metallic oxide species in the sample. Fig. 6B showed the region corresponding to C1s. The total region adjustment results were presented in Table 4 . The peaks corresponding to 285.07 and 284.83 eV were attributed to the C-O group (hydroxyl), while 286.07 eV and 286.26 eV peaks were related to the CO group (carbonyl). The peaks at 289.55 and 289.42 eV were related to π–π bond, which is typical of structures composed of aromatic carbons [22,36,37]. Fig. 6C presented the oxygen signal O1s and its deconvolutions. The binding energy values of the hydroxyl group (CO) were 531.52 and 531.38 eV. The binding energies of 533.39 and 533.19 eV were related to carbonyl groups (CO). The O2− component, at 530.0 eV, may be associated with carboxyl (CO) occurrence [37,38]. The spectrum of Co2p region (Fig. 6D) presented two photoemission maxima at binding energies centered at 780.38 eV for CoO2p3/2 and 796.3 eV for CoO2p1/2, corresponding to Co2+ specie. The satellite structures at 787 eV for Co2p3/2 and at 805 eV and for 2p1/2 were assigned to the shake-up lines. It is noticeable the presence of Co3+ species at the surface, centered at bands 782.7 for 2p3/2 and 801.2 eV for 2p1/2. Co2p line shape suggested the presence of two different Co species, evidenced by its large width and apparent doublet structure in the Co 2p1/2 outline. The broadening in the Co2p3/2 line is not so obvious. The reason is the energy separation between Co2p3/2 peak and Co2p1/2 peak is 15.8 eV, close to the pure CoO gap (15.5 eV), but the Co3O4 separation energy of 18.5 eV is substantially larger than pure Co3O4 (15.0 eV). The broadening of Co2p line suggested a superposition of Co3O4 and Co2+ oxide features [39]. The superficial Co concentration (Table 4) was calculated by the ratio of integrated peak areas. The Co3+ peak corresponded to the total area. The calculated ratio was Co2+/Co3+ = 1.98, indicating that Co2+ concentration is two times higher than Co3+. In fact, the higher concentration of Co2+ in CoO/rGO catalyst is possibly due to the charge transfer through graphene interface to the cobalt oxide nanoparticles [33,40]"
8,Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR),"3.2 Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) TPSR profile of the CO hydrogenation for the 15Co/rGO catalyst was recorded up to 400 °C. This technique coupled to MS is very sensitive and allows a primary investigation of the catalyst activity. The mass spectrum presented 4 different regions (Fig. 7 ). The first region began at 210 °C, where we observed only H2 formation alongside H2O up to 230 °C. No signs of CO, CO2, or CH4 were detected. It suggested solely an activation process of Co oxide surface, in agreement with TPR results. The CO and H2O reaction occurred between 275 and 306 °C, while CO2 and CH4 were produced, at a maximum temperature of 306 °C, without any H2 consumption. The reaction ended at around 350 °C. CO hydrogenation took place from 230 °C to 306 °C consuming and producing water. Meanwhile, CO2 and CH4 were formed, suggesting methanation, hydrogenation and, water–gas shift reaction occurrence, as given by the following equations: (1) CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O (2) nCO + 2nH2 → CnH2n + nH2O (3) 4CO + 2H2O → CH4 + 3CO2 (4) CO + H2O ⇌ H2 + CO2 The CO consumption increased with increasing temperature and reached its maximum at 375 °C. Besides, there were H2O, CH4 and, CO2 formation up to 400 °C n isothermal conditions, the methane signal increased alongside H2O and CO2 production. A decrease in activity with H2O production raise occurred at 400 °C. The decreasing activity may be correlated to coke formation that cannot be discarded However, H2O signal declined after reaching the maximum temperature, suggesting that graphene have reacted with water, producing CO and H2, according to Eq. (5). (5) C + H2O → CO + H2"
9,DRIFTS analysis results,"3.3 DRIFTS analysis results 3.3.1 CO adsorption study DRIFTS spectra of 15Co/rGO catalyst were obtained at different temperatures (Fig. 8 A) after 15 min of 5.0% CO/Ar flux. Two few intense bands at 2175 cm−1 and 2117 cm−1 were observed and both were related to CO weakly adsorbed. The band 2175 cm−1 was associated to CO adsorption on Co2+ or cationic cobalt species (Coδ+) [41–43] whereas the band 2117 cm−1 was assigned to linear CO bonding on metallic Co0 [44]. However, no other CO complex bands were found. Zhang et al. [43] and Cai et al. [41] found free and weakly bonded CO bands close to 2000 cm−1. Besides, intense bands between 1980 and 1950 cm−1 were expected, since they are associated to bridge-bonded CO on cobalt sites. The occurrence of bridge-bounded CO is an important step in CO dissociation and it is essencial for FTS mechanism [45]. After 5 min cleaning with Argon flux, the spectra (Fig. 8B) showed that all CO bands disappeared, confirming that CO adsorption was weakly bonded to metallic cobalt sites. Once Co sites were free and reduced, the electronic interaction between graphene and cobalt NPs may have affected the electron transfer of Co to carbon monoxide molecules. The complex formation between CO and cobalt is based on the electron backdonation from cobalt to CO, which weakens the carbon–oxygen bond, resulting in the CO dissociation. If the electron backdonation had occurred, the vibration frequency of CO would be shifted to lower wavenumbers and more complex bands should arise [46]. Since the expected complexes between CO and cobalt NPs were not formed, we can conclude that the charge transfer of cobalt d orbitals to graphene π orbitals and the backdonation event from metal NPs to the support, predicted only by simulation studies [47,48], may have interfered on the cobalt-CO electron backdonation. Notably, these results disagreed with those reported and stated before for Co/graphene-based catalysts [11]. This variance is due to the distinct electronic conductivity and electron mobility of the few-layered reduced graphene oxide (rGO), presented in this work, in contrast to high crystalline graphene-based materials investigated in previous studies [1,11-13]. 3.3.2 Syngas in situ reaction The in-situ reaction was also performed in sequence by DRIFTS. The CO/H2/Ar mixture flow was introduced at a ratio of H2/CO = 2, for 15 min different temperatures. The reference spectrum was the reduced catalyst one prior to gas admission. DRIFTS spectra at 200 °C and 250 °C under syngas flow are in Fig. 9 . Fig. 10 presented DRIFTS spectrum after cleaning process made at 250 °C for 15 min under vacuum and Ar flux. The CO bands, previously identified by adsorption, were observed at 2170 cm−1 and 2100 cm−1 [41,42]. These CO bands were shifted to lower wavenumbers, which suggests the effect of increasing the electron density by the H2 adsorption on these sites [49]. The adsorption band at 2355 cm−1 was related to CO2, which is more intense at 200 °C and decreased significantly at 250 °C and may be influenced by the water–gas shift reaction occurrence [42]. The highlighted figure on Fig. 9 showed the presence of new bands appearing at 1585 cm−1, which were assigned to C–H fragments. The bands at 1455 cm−1, (C–H)δas and a small doublet band at 1375 cm−1, assigned to νs (CH3)δs. 1390 cm−1 (δ C–H), and 1257 cm−1 bands are related to formate species or (CO) species. Also the band around 3015–3500 cm−1 was assigned to (OH), and (CH2)x from CH4, from CHx formation, as shown in Table 5 [50,51]. Heating the system at 250 °C in the closed cell and after 30 min (Fig. 10), and after cleaning with Ar flux, the spectra were obtained after 5′, 10′ and 15′. The CO2 band disappeared with increasing time, however, the COgas and CO adsorption bands remained unchanged. More intense bands around 1371, 1591, and 3250 cm−1, and a small band at 2350 cm−1 were observed, the last one was related to the CO2 formation. (νC-H) and at (δC–H) bands were also observed. Moreover, the small band at around 1650 cm−1 was assigned to the formation of CC species, suggesting olefins production. These bands indicate the formation of CH fragments, the formation of CC and the presence of formate species. Even though hydrocarbon related bands were detected, they were less intense and less complex than the ones reported for Co-based catalysts DRIFTS studies [41,42]. These results endorse that cobalt electronic interaction with few-layered graphene inhibited hydrocarbon formation, and CO adsorption study results as well. 3.3.3 Selectivity A mass spectrometer was coupled on the CO hydrogenation study using DRIFTS. We monitored the consumption of reactants and product formation at 200 and 250 °C. Several products, such as hydrocarbons, CO2, water, and alcohols were detected by tracking their mass fragments lines (Supplementary Information). The calculated relative selectivity of primary and secondary products is in Fig. 11 . Results based on the total area calculations revealed that methane and water formation was predominant, as expected from DRIFTS and TPSR analyses. CO2 is also a major product, and it was related to WGSR occurrence. The secondary products were light paraffin products (alkanes), olefins (alkenes) and/or branched hydrocarbons, and alcohols. Although these products were detected, their relative selectivity was small. Since a low conversion state was necessary for the DRIFTS study, we concluded that this condition favored the formation of light hydrocarbons and hydroxyl groups, as observed during DRIFTS experiments. Therefore, considering all in-situ analyses, the absence of bridge-bonded CO undermined CO hydrogenation reaction, probably due to graphene electronic interaction. 3.3.4 Catalytic test and post characterization The CO hydrogenation reaction was conducted in a fixed bed down flow reactor and the CO conversion results are presented in Fig. 12 . CO conversion remained stable, at about 2.5%, during 48 h. No products were significantly detected, in opposite to previous reports [1,11,12]. The same result was obtained after a scanning test of 15Co/rGO catalyst at different temperatures (Supplementary Information). After the catalytic test, we investigated the spent catalyst structure integrity in order to evaluate if it was deteriorated by reaction conditions. Then, we analyzed the spent catalyst by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 13 ) and infrared FTIR techniques (Fig. 14 ). It turned out that the most important graphene bands, D and G, were still present, i.e., the rGO structure was preserved. Also, D/G ratios were found to be 0.82 for the spent catalyst and 0.87 for the fresh one. The slight decrease in D/G may be related to the partial oxidation of the catalyst surface during the reaction. Moreover, the band corresponding to the Co species was still present and remained in the same position, but more intense than in the fresh catalyst, as a result of the partial reduction during the running. Therefore, graphene was not decomposed during the reaction and Co3O4 is still present as oxide species. The spent catalyst spectrum in FTIR analysis (Fig. 14) showed two strong bands at 2840 and 2920 cm−1, which were related to formate (δCH2 + υOCOass) and aliphatic (ν as CH3) functions adsorbed on catalyst surface [41,42]. Other bands were also identified: water (OH in 3300 cm−1 and COH in 1100 cm−1), CC (1650 cm−1), and CH2 (1450 cm−1) [42]. These intermediates could be associated to the adsorbed species formed during the reaction [42]. Probably, the products of CO hydrogenation were re-adsorbed on graphene structure. 3.3.5 Final comments After the catalytic test and post-characterization analyses, we concluded that the catalyst remained preserved and its metallic sites and support structure were still functional. Also, we found formate (HCOO−) species vibration adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Formate is known as a Water-Gas Shift intermediate and its presence is commonly related to WGSR occurrence [42,52]. As evidenced by DRIFTS results, CO molecules were weakly bonded to cobalt metallic sites and did not dissociate, since their IR bands were found at wavenumbers higher than 2100 cm−1. CO dissociation is a primordial step in the FTS mechanism, and it occurs due to the electron backdonation from cobalt to CO. Once CO is bonded to cobalt sites, the last unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CO overlaps with d orbitals of cobalt and the backdonation from metal to carbon monoxide molecule takes place (Fig. 15 ). Thus, the charge density transfer between LUMO and HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) weakens the carbon–oxygen bond, promoting CO dissociation and shifting its vibration frequency to lower IR wavenumbers [46]. Hereby, the absence of electron backdonation from metal NPs to CO molecules prevented carbon monoxide dissociation and undermined the catalyst activity during CO hydrogenation in situ experiments and FTS reaction. On the other hand, this fact favored WGSR, as observed from TPSR and DRIFTS results, since its mechanism does not depend on CO dissociation [52]. The backdonation from cobalt to few-layered graphene, without crystalline carbon phases, favors the opposite mobility of electrons, unlike what occurs for multi-layered carbon materials with a crystalline structure. Hence, Co-graphene interaction was not observed in previous catalytic studies [1,11–13], since the electronic properties of multi-layered graphenes diverge from few-layered ones [14]. Finally, we conclude that the electronic effects are significant for few-layered reduced graphene oxide as catalytic support and they disfavored hydrocarbon formation through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis."
10,Conclusions,"The following conclusions are: We successfully prepared few-layered graphene by chemical oxidation of graphite. Cobalt NPs were introduced by the precipitation-deposition method using an alcoholic solution. Structure and surface properties were evaluated. The catalytic performance was analyzed by in situ TPSR, DRIFTS, and catalytic test. The number of layers of GO, calculated by XRD, was about 12 and diminished to 2 layers for the rGO sample. This result confirmed the efficiency of the exfoliation and reduction methods of GO to rGO. The graphene D/G ratio, calculated by Raman spectroscopy, showed a significant increase in the disorder degree and defect sites on rGO support. XPS results showed that the ratio Co2+/Co3+ = 1.98, indicating a higher concentration of Co2+ species at the surface and electrostatic interaction with graphene surface. CO adsorption study by DRIFTS results suggested that carbon monoxide was weakly bonded to cobalt sites, not dissociating over the catalyst surface. The opposite electron transfer from Co nanoparticles to the synthesized few-layered graphene took place, impacting cobalt-CO electron backdonation."
