0,Introduction,"Approximately 1200million dry tons of cattle manure are produced annually in the world from about 964million head of cattle (USDA Economic Research Service, 2015). Cattle manure can lead to environmental pollutions if not handled properly (De Vries et al., 2012; Larney et al., 2014). Cattle manure contains abundant cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which has great potential for the production of value-added products, such as biogas, hydrogen rich gas, and bioethanol (Yue et al., 2011). Thermochemical conversion technology is considered as one of the most promising waste treatment practices, in which both energy recovery and pollution control can be achieved (Fernandez-Lopez et al., 2015; Parthasarathy and Narayanan, 2014; Cao et al., 2016). There are two major thermochemical reaction pathways: pyrolysis and gasification. Pyrolysis process is the thermal decomposition in the absence of oxygen with a relatively low temperature (450–600°C). The main products of pyrolysis are biochar, liquid biofuels, and gaseous fuel (Díaz-Rey et al., 2015). Gasification is a well-known thermochemical technology that can convert carbonaceous material into syngas by adding a gasifying agent. It is classified depending on the gasifying agent into air, steam, and air-steam, etc. (Lv et al., 2004). Compared with biomass air gasification, the steam-gasification process can produce high heating value hydrogen rich gas with high H2 content (30–60vol.%) Parthasarathy and Narayanan, 2014; Udomsirichakorn and Salam, 2014; Acar and Dincer, 2014. For the conventional steam gasification process, all biomass materials need to undergo a drying process before gasification. The high moisture biomass, such as cattle manure, would require a high-energy consumption. Thus, some researchers studied the in-situ gasification of wet biomass for hydrogen production (Guoxin and Hao, 2009; Peng et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). However, during in-situ gasification process, it is difficult to control and optimize different steps in one-gasifier due to overlapping of drying, pyrolysis, and gasification. Moreover, the volatile-char interactions had an inhibitory effect on the gasification of biochar (Kajitani et al., 2013). Therefore, to develop sustainable energy treatment of high moisture feedstocks, an important challenge is to regulate the reaction mechanism during gasification. In light of the above considerations, two-step gasification, including pyrolysis-carbonization and gasification steps, is here proposed to process cattle manure (Fig. 1 ). After drying, cattle manure is pyrolyzed/carbonized into biochar and volatile products (condensable and non-condensable gases). Then, the biochar is gasified for hydrogen rich gas production by introducing steam, produced in the drying process. Moreover, the pyrolysis-carbonization process can produce bio-oil and combustible gas. The bio-oil and gas can be used as feedstock to produce hydrogen rich gas by gasification. Moreover, the bio-oil can be used as a liquid fuel or chemical feedstock in various applications. In addition, the flue gas recycle route in the whole process can make full use of the energy of flue gas. At present, some studies have reported the gasification properties of biochar from different biomass materials. Sattar et al. (2014) studied the steam gasification of biochar derived from rapeseed, wood, sewage sludge and miscanthus, and obtained high-quality syngas. Salleh et al. (2010) investigated the air gasification characteristics of biochar from empty fruit bunches, optimized the hydrogen rich gas production, and observed that biochar of empty fruit bunches has a great potential to replace coal as a gasification agent in power plants. However, the effect of manure biochar derived from different carbonization temperatures on hydrogen rich gas production during biochar gasification process has not been reported. This study aims to enhance the hydrogen rich gas production of cattle manure biochar derived from different pyrolysis-carbonization temperatures through a two-step gasification process. The products distribution and biochar properties from different pyrolysis-carbonization temperatures were studied in the pyrolysis-carbonization process. Furthermore, the effect of biochar preparation temperatures and gasification temperature on hydrogen production was investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Cattle manure,"2.1 Cattle manure Cattle manure used in this study was collected from the Dongzheng feedlot located in Jiangxia District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, PR China. The moisture content of fresh cattle manure was 85.12±1.5wt%. The cattle manure samples were dried, crushed and screened to 60 mesh (0.250mm) size particles. The cattle manure sample was stored in air-tight containers."
3,Biochars preparation,"2.2 Biochars preparation Cattle manure (dry basis) was pyrolyzed/carbonized at temperatures of 300, 350, 400, 500 and 600°C, holding time of 30, 60, 90 and 120min. Pyrolysis-carbonization was carried out in a laboratory-scale fixed bed reaction system, which was from SHENGLI Test Instruments Co. Ltd (SLG1200-100, Shanghai, China). The fixed bed system consisted of an electric furnace heater and a quartz tube reactor (1000mm length and 90mm inner diameter). Prior to starting the reaction system, the gas phase in the quartz tube reactor was flushed with 99.99% nitrogen for 0.5h to ensure that the reactor has inert atmosphere. The reactor was then heated to the desired temperature. For each run, 10.00g sample (dried basis) was loaded onto a porcelain boat and placed in the reactor at desired temperature. When the run was completed, the reactor was flushed with nitrogen to maintain anoxic conditions. After being cooled to room temperature, the produced biochar was taken out and weighed to calculate the biochar yield. Finally, the biochar was ground to pass through a 100 mesh sieve and stored in air-tight containers for further use."
4,Steam gasification of biochar,"2.3 Steam gasification of biochar The biochar derived from different carbonization temperatures (300, 350, 400, 500 and 600°C) with a holding time of 30min was used as feedstock for steam gasification. The biochar samples from 300 to 600°C were named BC-300, BC-350, BC-400, BC-500, and BC-600, respectively. Steam gasification experiments were also carried out in the fixed bed reactor described in Section 2.2. For each run, 5.00g of biochar was gasified at the desired temperatures (750°C, 850°C) for 30min. Steam used in gasification was produced by a steam generator (Suzhou Richtreatment Environment Technologies, Inc.), and introduced into the reactor with a flow rate of 1.66g/min. The produced syngas was condensed using a ball condenser, washed, and analyzed by gas chromatography. To minimize the effect of random errors, each run was duplicated and the average data was reported."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The elemental compositions (C, H, N and O) of samples were determined by an elemental analyzer (V Vario Micro cube CHNS Analyzer, Germany). The O content was calculated by difference. The volatiles content of samples was determined in thermal analyzer (SDT Q600). Ash content was measured using the Laboratory Analytical Procedure (LAP) developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Sluiter et al., 2008. The fixed carbon (FC) content of the test samples was calculated by difference. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the samples was performed by a simultaneous thermal analyzer (TA SDT Q600) under atmospheric pressure. Samples were heated in the TA apparatus from ambient temperature to 1000°C with a constant heating rate (10°C/min). The carrier gas was ultrahigh pure nitrogen (99.99%), which was supplied with a constant flow rate of 100ml/min, to maintain an inert atmosphere and purge the volatiles generated from sample pyrolysis. The surface morphology of the biochar was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390LV, NTC, Japan). The functional group analyses of the biochar were achieved using a FT-IR spectrometer (VERTEX70, Germany) in the range of 600–4000cm−1 wavenumbers. The syngas component was detected by gas chromatography, GC9790II (FULI, Zhejiang, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a 1.5m stainless steel packed column with 5A molecular sieve, and a Hayesep Q packed column (ATEO, Lanzhou, China). The temperatures of the injector, detector and oven were maintained at 55°C, 100°C and 50°C, respectively. Standard gas mixtures (SGMs) were used for quantitative calibration, and two SGMs were prepared based on volume percentages, which includes SGMs 1 (75.1% H2 and 24.9% N2), SGMs 2 (40.0% CO, 25.0% CH4 and 35.0% CO2). Argon was used as the carrier gas. The weight loss of feedstocks in carbonization and gasification process was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) Weight loss rate ( % ) = W 0 - W end W 0 × 100 % where W 0 is the mass of feedstocks for carbonization or gasification, dry basis; Wend is the mass of residues after carbonization or gasification, dry basis. Carbon conversion efficiency (xc ) is the fraction of carbon in cattle manure that was converted to gas products (CO, CO2, and CH4). The xc was calculated as follows: (2) x c ( % ) = 12 Y ( % C - CO 2 + % C - CO + % C - CH 4 ) 22.4 × % C - feedstock × 100 % where Y is the product gas yield (m3/kg); %C-CO2, %C-CO and %C-CH4 are the molar percentages of carbon in components of product gas (CO2, CO and CH4), respectively; %C-feedstock is the mass percentage of carbon in ultimate analysis of feedstock (cattle manure or biochar). The lower heating value (LHV) of syngas was calculated by the Eq. (3): (3) LHV ( MJ / m 3 ) = ( % CO × 126.36 + % H 2 × 107.98 + % CH 4 × 358.18 ) 1000 where %H2, %CO, and %CH4 are the molar percentages of the components of the product gas (H2, CO and CH4), respectively; and the coefficient multiplying each components represents the corresponding LHV of each gas, KJ/m3."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pyrolysis-carbonization process,"3.1 Pyrolysis-carbonization process The pyrolysis-carbonization process of cattle manure was the first and significant stage in two-step gasification. The operating conditions of pyrolysis-carbonization would influence the product distribution and its properties. Furthermore, the hydrogen rich gas production and carbon conversion efficiency of biochar were affected by biochar’s properties. 3.1.1 Effect of pyrolysis-carbonization temperature and holding time on product distribution The distribution of pyrolysis-carbonization products was sensitive to the pyrolysis-carbonization conditions, especially to temperature. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of solid, liquid and gaseous products at the temperatures ranging from 300 to 600°C and holding times of 30–120min. With increasing temperature, the gas yield increased steadily, while the biochar yield declined dramatically by about 25% when the temperature increased from 300°C to 600°C. This trend was consistent with the previous reports (Angın, 2013; Hossain et al., 2011), which can be attributed to primary decomposition and secondary decomposition of char residues (Park et al., 2010). The liquid yield first increased and then decreased at 600°C, particularly, due to cracking of liquid products to generate gas at high temperatures (Akhtar and Saidina Amin, 2012). The holding time had a significant effect on biochar yield at a relatively low temperature (Fig. 2), which became weaker with increasing pyrolysis-carbonization temperature. For example, when pyrolysis-carbonization temperature was 300°C, the biochar yield was 65.6% at 30min, and it decreased to 61.45% at 120min. However, at 600°C, the biochar yields at 30min and 120min had no obvious differences. Moreover, with the increase of holding time, the gas yield was increased and liquid yield was decreased. This was due to the second cracking reaction of a fraction of heavy hydrocarbon with the extension of holding time, especially under high temperature. Therefore, the temperature and holding time have a synergistic effect on pyrolysis-carbonization products and mechanism. The product distribution including solid, gas, and liquid yields, affected the distribution of chemical energy derived from biomass (Mašek et al., 2013). If the gases and liquids are recycled for steam gasification or for providing heat, the energy conversion efficiency will be significantly improved. The gasification behaviors of biochar were mainly attributed to different biochar properties. Moreover, the temperature played a leading role compared with the holding time. Thus, the biochar properties derived from different temperatures were studied as follows. 3.1.2 Elemental composition and proximate analysis of biochar In Table 1 , the weight loss during carbonization is given. As the pyrolysis-carbonization temperature increased from 300°C to 600°C, the weight loss was increased from 34.40% to 61.90%. This indicated that more and more cattle manure were converted into volatiles (gas and liquid). The trend of weight loss was also consistent with the biochar yield trend mentioned in product distribution. The elemental composition of biochar obtained from different pyrolysis-carbonization temperatures for 30min is also shown in Table 1. As the temperature varied from 300 to 600°C, the C content increased by 30.68%, and the H and O contents decreased by 14.72% and 60.31%, respectively. This trend was consistent with the wood and bamboo biochars reported in earlier study (Sun et al., 2014). The N content in biochar had a decline trend with increasing temperature, due to release of nitrogen containing compounds at high temperatures (Ro et al., 2010). The H/C and O/C analysis showed that the biochar from high temperature had high aromatic functional groups and less polarity. The proximate analysis of cattle manure and biochar samples showed that the volatile matter (VM) content of biochar was reduced from 48.64% to 13.58% with increasing temperature (Table 1). This resulted from the decomposition of lignocelluloses in feedstock (Ahmad et al., 2012), and most of volatiles were produced during pyrolysis-carbonization process. Moreover, the decreased of VM can be proved by the fact that an increase of weight loss was observed with increasing temperatures. The fixed carbon (FC) and ash contents in biochar gradually increased by 59.87% and 77.50%, respectively, as the temperature increased from 300 to 600°C. This was caused by the excess loss of volatile matter. These results were similar to the previous reports by Enders et al. (2012). In addition, compared with other biomass, the ash content in cattle manure was high, which resulted in high ash content in cattle manure biochar (Xu and Chen, 2013). 3.1.3 TG and DTG analysis of biochar Thermal gravimetric (TG) and derivative thermal gravimetric (DTG) analysis of cattle manure and biochar samples derived from different pyrolysis-carbonization temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the weight loss followed the order of cattle manure >BC-300>BC-350>BC-400>BC-500>BC-600. The weight of final residues was 28.84% for cattle manure, while it varied from 49.87% in BC-300 to 82.45% in BC-600. The biochar from high temperature had low weight loss, indicating well thermal stability of biochar under 500–600°C of pyrolysis-carbonization temperatures. As for the DTG curves of all samples, there were some non-degraded cellulose and lignin in BC-300 (Kim et al., 2012). Similarly, BC-350 and BC-400 had some non-degraded lignin. The peak between 600°C and 700°C was the volatilization of metallic minerals (Liu et al., 2014). The peaks of metallic minerals from BC-500 and BC-600 were stronger than those from other samples, which indicated high metallic minerals in BC-500 and BC-600. Moreover, weights of final residues of BC-500 and BC-600 were higher than those of other biochars, and volatile matter content of BC-500 and BC-600 were less than other biochars. Therefore, the main reaction in the steam gasification of BC-500 and BC-600 was the steam reforming of biochar. 3.1.4 SEM and FT-IR analysis of biochar SEM images of cattle manure and biochars are compared in Fig. 4 . The SEM image shows that the cattle manure had a relatively smooth and flat structure. After pyrolysis-carbonization, the surface of BC-300 had some abnormal pore structures because of the degradation of organic component in cattle manure. As the carbonization temperature increased, the surface of BC-350 and BC-400 exhibited several cracks and holes due to the evolution of volatile matter during pyrolysis-carbonization process (Özçimen and Ersoy-Meriçboyu, 2010). The image of BC-500 displayed a large block structure and knaggy surface. The SEM image of BC-600 showed the knaggy surface and some pore structure, which may be due to further decomposition of char. The infrared spectra of cattle manure and biochar is shown in Fig. 4. All biochar samples had similar chemical groups with all biochars showing three significant bands at (1) wavenumber at 3430cm−1, which was attributed to OH stretching, (2) wavenumber near 1625cm−1, which contributed to aromatic CC ring stretching, (3) wavenumber near 1069cm−1, which was aliphatic ether CO and alcohol CO stretching. Compared with biochar, the cattle manure had a strong absorbance near 3430cm−1, 1650cm−1, and 1069cm−1. With the increase in carbonization temperature, the absorbance became weak. Cattle manure was rich in aromatic (1563cm−1 and 1633cm−1) and aliphatic functional groups (1023cm−1, 1373cm−1). The aromatic structure of biochar samples was altered in comparison with the cattle manure sample. The peak at 877cm−1 of BC-600 indicated 1 adjacent H deformation."
8,Hydrogen rich gas production in biochar gasification,"3.2 Hydrogen rich gas production in biochar gasification The gasification performance of biochar depended on the biochar properties including the volatile matter, element contents, SEM as well as thermal properties, which can be influenced by pyrolysis-carbonization temperature. The gasification temperature can also affect the gasification performance. Therefore, the effect of biochar with different properties on syngas yield and compositions, and the effect of gasification temperature on hydrogen concentration and hydrogen yield were investigated in the biochar steam gasification process. 3.2.1 Effect of biochar produced at different temperatures on steam gasification performance of biochar The main compositions of produced gas (N2 free and dry basis) under various feedstocks (cattle manure and biochar samples) and a temperature of 850°C are shown in Fig. 5 . The H2 concentration of biochar samples varied from 53.63% to 58.01%, obviously higher than that of cattle manure (47.03%). This was because the carbon content of biochar was high, and the steam reforming reaction of biochar and hydrocarbons was promoted to obtain a high hydrogen concentration. However, the CH4 concentration of biochar was low (1.60–5.54%) compared with the cattle manure (9.75%). This may be because cattle manure produced more volatiles (e.g. CH4, CO, CO2, etc.) during gasification process, which inhibited the gasification of biochar and resulted in a high CH4 concentration. As the biochar preparation temperature increased from 300 to 600°C, the H2 concentration was increased slightly, and the CH4 concentration showed an opposite trend. For instance, the H2 concentration from BC-350 was 53.87%, the H2 concentration from BC-600 was 58.01%, which was 7.69% higher than that of BC-350. This was because the biochar produced at high temperature had high carbon content and low volatile matter content (Table 1, Fig. 3), which improved the steam reforming of biochar. The CH4 concentration was 1.60% for BC-600, which was significantly less than that for the cattle manure (9.75%). The reduction of CH4 concentration was due to the conversion of non-degraded components in biochar to non-condensable gas (such as CH4) and condensable gas during the gasification process. The CO and CO2 concentrations fluctuated by 2%. The syngas yield and weight loss varied with the feedstocks at 850°C (Table 2 ). The syngas yield from BC-500 (1.61m3/kg) and BC-600 (1.59m3/kg) were the maximum, which were higher than those from cattle manure (1.04m3/kg) and BC-300 (1.48m3/kg). This indicated that the biochar preparation temperature played an important role on the biochar gasification performance. The syngas yield from biochar was higher than that from manure, which may be due to the rich porous structure and C content in biochar (Fig. 4, Table 1). The weight loss of BC-500 (49.90%) and BC-600 (43.70%) was significantly less than the cattle manure (83.70%) and BC-300 (62.60%). These findings indicate that the high temperature biochar can yield high syngas and low bio-oil due to low volatile matter content and high carbon content in high temperature biochar (Table 1), which would be beneficial for reaction between steam and cha (Li, 2013). The bio-oil vapor condenses to tar at low temperature, which can cause the blocking and fouling problems in downstream equipment, and environmental concerns (Chen et al., 2011). Therefore, two-step gasification of biomass is a suitable way to reduce tar production in syngas products and biochar generated at high temperatures is an ideal feedstock to increase hydrogen concentration in the gasification process. The C-conversion rate of feedstocks at 850°C was similar, and the C content in biochar was higher than the cattle manure, which indicated that the C mass in biochar syngas was higher than the C mass in cattle manure. This was also consistent with the gas yield trend of feedstocks. The LHV of syngas from cattle manure was higher than those from biochars, and it decreased with the increase in biochar generated temperature. This was because that the CH4 concentration from cattle manure was higher than that from biochar, and the LHV of CH4 was higher than that of H2. 3.2.2 Effect of gasification temperature on hydrogen production The hydrogen concentration and yield of cattle manure and biochar at the gasification temperature of 750°C and 850°C are shown in Fig. 6 . The H2 concentration for cattle manure and BC-300 at 850°C were slightly higher than those at 750°C. The H2 concentrations for BC-350, BC-400, BC-500, and BC-600 at 750°C and 850°C did not have obvious differences. However, the hydrogen yield at 850°C was significantly higher than the yield at 750°C. For example, the hydrogen yield of BC-500 at 850°C was 0.93m3/kg, which was 1.79 times higher than that at 750°C. This is because the steam reforming of biochar is an endothermic reaction, and high temperature favors this reaction. Furthermore, the steam reforming of hydrocarbon also contributes to the hydrogen yield at high temperature. Many studies have also reported that high gasification temperature can enhance the hydrogen yield (Berrueco et al., 2014; Erkiaga et al., 2014). However, the temperature over 900°C would lead to a high-energy consumption. Therefore, 750°C and 850°C of gasification temperatures were selected as optimal temperatures and hence compared. The hydrogen yield of feedstocks had a similar trend at gasification temperatures of 750°C and 850°C. The hydrogen yields from BC-600, BC-500, BC-400, BC-350, BC-300 and cattle manure were 0.92m3/kg, 0.93m3/kg, 0.84m3/kg, 0.84m3/kg, 0.79m3/kg and 0.49m3/kg, respectively. No significant differences of hydrogen yields between BC-500 and BC-600, and between BC-350 and BC-400, respectively, were observed. These may be because the C content, volatile matter, SEM, and FT-IR of BC-500 and BC-600 were similar. There were also similar between the BC-400 and BC-300. The result of feedstocks order for syngas yield can indicate that the biochar produced at high temperature is suitable for hydrogen production. For BC-500 and BC-600, the C content was high compared with other biochars, which was conducive to steam reforming reaction (C+H2O↔CO+H2 +131kJ/mol). Moreover, the volatile matter content in BC-600 and BC-500 was the least among all feedstocks, which reduced the negative effect of volatile matter on char gasification (Kajitani et al., 2013). In addition, temperature can also affect the C-conversion and weight loss of feedstocks in the gasification process (Table 2). The C-conversion of feedstocks at 850°C was higher than that at 750°C. The weight loss of manure and biochars (BC-300 to BC-600) at 850°C was 1.07, 1.19, 1.32, 1.36, 1.94 and 1.78 times higher than those at 750°C, respectively. This was because most steam reforming reactions were endothermic reactions, and hence high temperature favored the reaction between steam and carbon. Due to equivalent gas concentrations at two gasification temperatures, the corresponding gas LHV for feedstocks at 850°C and 750°C was also similar. Increasing biochar production temperature can enhance the hydrogen yield and reduce bio-oil yield at high gasification temperature. Therefore, high temperature biochar gasification for producing hydrogen rich gas is a promising method to provide a sustainable pathway toward a waste-to-hydrogen energy solution, especially for biomass with high moisture content."
9,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated that the two-step gasification of cattle manure can enhance the hydrogen rich gas production. The biochar from a pyrolysis-carbonization temperature of 500°C had high carbon content and low volatiles content, which was suitable for hydrogen production. The steam gasification of BC-500 at gasification temperature of 850°C can obtain the highest syngas production (1.61m3/kg). The corresponding hydrogen concentration and yield were 57.58 % and 0.93m3/kg, respectively. This study shows that the two-step gasification is an efficient waste-to-hydrogen energy process, which can also facilitate an effective utilization of cattle manure."
