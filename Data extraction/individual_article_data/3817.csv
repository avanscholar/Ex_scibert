0,Introduction,"The steadily increasing market price and foreseeable shortage of oil and gas are the movers for the use of biomass as a renewable feedstock in the energy sector besides solar and wind power uses. Therefore, the alternative production of energy, fuels and a wide variety of chemicals and polymers from biomass has attracted immense attention in recent years (e.g. [1–5]). It is absolutely true that “biomass is the only practical source of renewable liquid fuel” [6] but it is also very clear that biomass cannot cover the demand, neither today nor in the future. Therefore, our future energy, fuel and chemicals pool will be much more diverse than today. Lignocellulosic biomass has a complex nature and it consists of 40–50% cellulose, 20–35% hemicellulose and 20–40% lignin depending on the origin. This composition and lignocellulosic stability make a selective conversion toward specific products or product classes quite difficult because different bond types have to be cleaved and it necessitates more drastic conditions such as high temperature and pressure in addition to specific separation technologies [7]. Combustion (for the production of heat), gasification (for the production of syngas, i.e. CO/H2), pyrolysis and liquefaction (for the production of liquid bio-oil or bio-crude) are the most commonly used methods applied for converting biomass into energy or fuels. The bio-oil production methods seem to be privileged due to its higher energy density output, and it is easier to transport and store than bulky solid biomass itself or gaseous products. The hydrothermal liquefaction using hot compressed water (HCW) in particular is a cost-effective method and has been focused for long time due to its relatively mild conditions and potential for producing bio-oil in high yields [8,9]. The main advantage of hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass is that the feedstock needs not to be dry or pre-treated in other ways, making it an economical process, probably. Under hydrothermal conditions, water and its mixtures with other fluids attain properties suitable for biomass liquefaction such as still high density to increase solvent power, good heat and mass transfer capabilities like in gases, fast decomposition of organics due to solvent reactivity, and utilization of variable solubility for extraction/separation effects. Due to the large number of reaction types and mechanisms involved, the process of biomass liquefaction is very complex: biomass materials are depolymerized into fragments, first by hydrolysis, and then degraded to smaller compounds by dehydration, deoxygenation, and hydrodeoxygenation (e.g. [9,10]). Moreover, HCW has been found to be very effective for promoting ionic, polar non-ionic, and free-radical reactions (depending on pressure and temperature), which make it a promising reaction medium for biomass conversion reactions [11]. Similarly, alcohols (e.g. EtOH) are interesting reaction media since their supercritical conditions can be attained at significant lower temperature and pressure than that of water [12]. Recently, Yu and co-workers have summarized the advances in hydrolysis of biomass in hot compressed water in comparison to acid or base hydrolysis as well as enzymatic hydrolysis [13]. Liquefaction of wood and other lignocellulosic materials in the presence of phenol under acidic (sulfuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, and oxalic acids) or alkaline conditions (NaOH, Cu(OH)2, NaHCO3) and by using metal salts (AlCl3, CuSO4, FeSO4, and NaH2PO4) is widely investigated (e.g. [14,15]). However, disadvantages of such processes using strong acids include partial carbonization of biomass during liquefaction and corrosion of the equipment. Various research is also known using sub- and supercritical media such as phenol [16], but the use of expensive phenol as the liquefaction solvent coupled with the difficulties in its recycling and environmental concerns make these processes unattractive. Alternatively, other organic solvents, such as alcohols and cyclic carbonates, were tested for low-temperature liquefaction of biomass (e.g. [10,17–19]). Yuan et al. [20] and Xu et al. [21] obtained a high bio-oil yield of 39.7% (from rice straw) and 65% (from pine sawdust), respectively, when alcohol was used as co-solvent along with water. These solvents could be recycled by evaporation after liquefaction and are much cheaper than phenol. A nice overview on basics of biomass conversion processes is given by Küçük and Demirbaş summarizing the literature up to the mid-1990s [22]. Möller et al. [23] reported in a very recent review on the state-of-art on hydrothermal biomass conversion. Further results were reported in a review from Toor et al. [24] on hydrothermal liquefaction under subcritical conditions. In addition, it looks that catalysts play an increasing role in biomass conversion into fuels [25]. Appell et al. already reported some decades ago that a woody biomass could be converted into liquid products in the presence of syngas or CO with aqueous sodium carbonate as a catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressures [26], other studies reported on the use of metallic catalysts [27]. Recently, we have reported on first trials of liquefaction of lignin under sub- and supercritical conditions of water and water–ethanol mixtures, respectively [28]. These tests were mainly carried out in batch mode. In continuation of this work, we were engaged in hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass into bio-oils in a semi-continuous apparatus. Wheat straw was used as model biomass and several experiments were carried out in HCW medium and further a detailed study was done using water–ethanol mixtures. The effect of the different reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, alcohol proportion, addition of a heterogeneous catalyst, and reaction environment (phase behavior) on the straw conversion and yield of the bio-oil as well as on the higher heating value (HHV) of the product oils was monitored."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Wheat straw chaff used in this study was received from a local agricultural supplier used as it is without any pretreatment. Ethanol (99.8%) and isopropanol (99.7%) were procured from Across Organics. Pressurized gases such as nitrogen or hydrogen used for the reactions were taken from commercially available cylinders (Air Liquide). For catalyzed runs, a 5wt% Ru/H-Beta catalyst was prepared by impregnation method using ruthenium(III) chloride (Strem Chemicals) and H-Beta zeolite (Zeochem AG, BET=669.9m2/g) as support. Ruthenium(III) chloride was dissolved in water and the calculated amount of H-Beta was added to this solution and stirred at room temperature for 2h followed by evaporation of residual liquid under further stirring at moderate temperature (70°C). Thus obtained catalyst was dried in an oven at 110°C over night (15h) and calcined using synthetic air (Air Liquide) and reduced under hydrogen (Air Liquide) at 400°C for 5h."
3,Instrumental setup,"2.2 Instrumental setup The setup used for the liquefaction runs consisted of a stainless steel tubular reactor that was placed in a heating box (up to 200°C) to avoid undesired condensation of vapors (Fig. 1 ). The reactor (i.d.=10mm, l=400mm, V (reaction zone)=10ml) was heated by an electric heating coil. Reactor heater temperature was controlled by using a thermocouple installed in the heating coil; in addition, a movable thermocouple was placed in a guiding tube inside the straw package to measure the temperature inside the reactor. In general, the biomass was loaded between two stainless steel frits in the vertical mid of the reactor, placed on a tubular spacer. For some catalyzed runs, a catalyst bed was additionally positioned at the reactor outlet side between the lower end of the biomass and the lower frit. Liquids (water, ethanol, water–ethanol or water–isopropanol mixtures) were pumped by a HPLC pump (Shimadzu). Inert gas for dilution and use as internal standard or hydrogen to support deoxygenation was fed from commercial gas cylinders as already mentioned. Downstream of reactor outlet a countercurrent water cooler was installed. A two-stage backpressure regulation released the reaction pressure to ambient; the gaseous phase was separated from the liquid one and both the phases were analyzed by means of gas chromatography and other methods."
4,Liquefaction experiments,"2.3 Liquefaction experiments The liquefaction experiments were carried out in the above described semi-continuously operating setup (see Fig. 1); the biomass (3–5g) was placed in the reactor between the frits. The catalyst (5wt% Ru/H-Beta, 0.5–1g of solid, i.e. 0.5–1ml) was placed in some runs just below the wheat straw assuming the gaseous biomass cracking products come in contact with the catalyst and facilitates the oxygen removal in presence of hydrogen. The feed solution composed of water, ethanol or water–ethanol (water–isopropanol) mixture was passed over the biomass using the high pressure pump with a liquid flow of 0.5–1ml/min. In case of a catalyst present, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) related to the used catalyst volume totalled to 60h−1. The reactor was operated at temperatures up to 350°C and pressures up to 200bar. The workup techniques for the various product streams from the reactor are depicted schematically in Fig. 2 . Gaseous products were analyzed online by GC (Hewlett Packard 5890, column 1=Poraplot Q, l=25m, i.d.=0.53mm, f.t.=0.20μm; column 2=HP PLOT molesieve, l=25m, i.d.=0.53mm) equipped with FID (CO, CH4, CO2 via methanizer) and TCD (N2, H2, CH4, CO) detectors using Ar as carrier gas. The solid and liquid products were separated by filtration prior to analysis. The solid proportion was dried and weighed and included in calculation of wheat straw conversion. The liquid products were extracted using dichloromethane (2ml×25ml) and two different types (phases) of oils, one with high heating value (high-caloric oil – HCO, dichloromethane soluble) and the other with low heating value (low-caloric oil – LCO, water soluble), were obtained after evaporation of the solvent. The HCO and LCO yields were calculated on a weight basis calculated on wheat straw placed in reactor. As an additional characteristic number, the “Higher Heating Value” (HHV) [29] of the bio-oils was calculated by using Dulong's formula (Eq. (1)) [30]. The formula considers the main biomass components such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with their percentage obtained from elemental analysis and the heating value of the pure substances, i.e. carbon and hydrogen. The last term in the bracket considers the heat loss due to the formation of water. (1) HHV ( MJ / KG ) = 338.2 × % C + 1442.8 × % H − % O 8 × 0.001 Two different methods were used for the determination of wheat straw conversion for the reactions in HCW and ethanol and ethanol (isopropanol)–water mixtures, respectively. In case of the reactions carried out in HCW, the conversion (X, Eq. (2)) was directly obtained from total organic carbon (TOC) analysis of aqueous samples received after reaction using a Shimadzu analyzer (TOC-VCPN) vs. biomass proportion originally loaded. Conversion databased on carbon proportion in feed and products including carbon proportion of gas share. The TOC analyzer always displays data for total carbon (TC) and for inorganic carbon (IC) separately. These two carbon types were calibrated using potassium hydrogenphthalate for TC and a mixture of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 for IC, according to standard procedures recommended by Shimadzu. Thus, TOC concentration was determined by subtracting IC from TC. In general, TOC analysis gave reliable data with respect to C-balance of the reaction. (2) X Biomass ( % ) = TOC of the product solution TOC of the parent biomass × 100 The determination of the carbon content in the second set of runs using alcohols (ethanol, isopropanol) as reaction medium makes it difficult to measure TOC. Therefore, the amount of the solid remaining after the reaction was used for determination of the biomass conversion. In this case, conversion is mostly given based on recovered solid residue after the reaction (X, Eq. (3)), which was further analyzed by CHN element analysis. The catalyst weight was subtracted from the dry solid residue for those tests running in the presence of a catalyst. (3) X Biomass % = Weight of the residue − Weight of the catalyst Weight of the parent biomass × 100 The detailed liquid product analysis was carried out mainly by GC or GC–MS; summary analyses were carried out using the TOC (total organic carbon) method or CHN analysis. Silylation of raw product for GC or GC–MS analysis was carried out using a standard procedure by adding hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 70°C for 2h."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Liquefaction of wheat straw in HCW,"3.1 Liquefaction of wheat straw in HCW Fig. 3 shows the temperature effect on conversion, product yield and distribution of HCO vs. LCO in hydrothermal liquefaction of wheat straw at 100bar and 6h on-stream. It can be clearly seen that with increase in temperature the conversion rises, as expected, but in addition, the product composition changes significantly. The proportion of HCO steadily increases whereas the amount of LCO (including gases) drops. This suggests a more effective deoxygenation at higher reaction temperature being mirrored by an increased HHV value of the examined product oil. The obtained HHV value respectably increases from 9.5MJ/kg at 250°C to 25.5MJ/kg at 350°C. Thus, the reaction temperature is a crucial parameter in effective conversion of biomass toward liquid products as well as in the deoxygenation of the intermediately formed depolymerized components from the lignocellulosic biomass. Otherwise, no significant effect on the biomass conversion and HCO yield was observed when the same tests were carried out at 200bar reaction pressure (Fig. 4 ). Similar wheat straw conversions were reached and HCO yields were in the same range from 10 to 20wt%. But interestingly, the HHV values of the HCO proportion were much higher even at low reaction temperature, e.g. 24.5MJ/kg at 250°C compared to the 100bar run (9.5MJ/kg), indicating that the higher pressure strongly supports the oxygen removal. This could be explained by the capability of HCW to promote an effective deoxygenation as claimed for aqueous phase reforming (APR) reaction for valorization of various types of renewable feedstock (e.g. [13,31,32])."
7,Liquefaction of wheat straw in water–ethanol mixtures,"3.2 Liquefaction of wheat straw in water–ethanol mixtures Fig. 5 depicts the effect of modification of the reaction medium from water (i.e. HCW) to ethanol and some water–ethanol mixtures. These runs were carried out at 300°C and 100bar reaction pressure. Obviously, pure ethanol (which attains supercritical state) was quite powerful reaction medium showing a wheat straw conversion of ca. 80% after 2h on-stream resulting in a yield of 23.7wt% for the HCO portion with a HHV of 28.2MJ/kg. Biomass conversion rose to 90% by using 25vol% aqueous ethanol. The conversion could be further increased to >95% using a 50:50 (v/v) mixture. This run also revealed highest HCO proportion (ca. 30wt%) with a HHV of 28MJ/kg after 2h on-stream. In contrast, the best data (X <90%, HCO portion=10wt%, HHV<23MJ/kg) reported above for treatment in HCW were received after 6h on-stream for comparison. Further increase in ethanol amount led to somewhat lower conversion and slightly decreased HCO proportion, but HHV is still high. Obviously, pure ethanol and aqueous mixtures could reduce the surface tension of the liquefied products and, hence, improve the diffusion of solvent to the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin matrix. Ethanol is also expected to readily dissolve relatively high-molecular-weight liquid products/intermediates derived from the polymeric units because of its lower dielectric constant compared to that of water. The synergy between water and alcohol has also been proved previously in organosolv delignification of woody biomass at temperatures between 160 and 200°C, where hot pressurized ethanol or water–ethanol solutions were found to be very effective solvents for wood decomposition [33,34]. In addition, own studies have shown that ethanol in sub- and supercritical state can be a powerful reaction medium in depolymerization of lignin [28,35]. Further increase in reaction temperature to 350°C using a 50:50 (v/v) water–ethanol mixture at 100bar showed complete conversion (Fig. 6 , 2nd bar) and HHV was in the same range (28MJ/kg) as seen at 300°C (cf. Fig. 5). Anyway, the HCO amount was significantly reduced to less than 20wt% and LCO (plus gases) portion increased mainly due to deeper cracking. Conversion at 250°C in 50:50 (v/v) water–ethanol mixture was less, i.e. close to 70% as expected (Fig. 6, 1st bar). Further increase in reaction pressure from 100 (Fig. 5, 3rd bar) up to 200bar did not show any improvement compared to the test at 100bar (Fig. 6, 3rd bar). A similar result was obtained using water–isopropanol (50:50 (v/v)) mixture at 300°C and 100bar (Fig. 6, 4th bar), but conversion was less compared to the test in water–ethanol (50:50 (v/v), cf. Fig. 5, 3rd bar). In a final experiment, the 5wt% Ru/H-Beta catalyst (1g) was placed below the wheat straw package and the run was carried out using water–ethanol mixture (50:50 (v/v)) at 300°C and 80bar but using hydrogen instead of inert nitrogen. Conversion and HCO amount were a little bit less compared to the 100bar test without catalyst (cf. Fig. 5, 3rd bar), but this was due to the reduced reaction pressure as also other runs at reduced pressures proved. The most beneficial use of the catalyst and the introduction of hydrogen was the significantly increased HHV of the HCO charge, a value of ca. 31MJ/kg was reached compared to 28MJ/kg from the reference experiment. The TOC and CHN analyses showed that the obtained HCO fraction has much higher heating values compared to crude wheat straw (14.2MJ/kg, Table 1 ). This value can be nearly doubled by conversion in sc-EtOH. Wheat straw conversion reached values >80% and a high-caloric bio-oil (HCO) is formed with a yield of ca. 25wt% related to carbon. Products obtained with water–ethanol mixtures as solvent revealed similar HHV properties, but HCO yield can be increased. The use of a catalyst led to an improved deoxygenation efficiency but only in the presence of additionally fed hydrogen."
8,Product analysis,"3.3 Product analysis The detailed product analyses were carried out in some cases by GC–MS. Fig. 7 depicts a typical chromatogram from HCO analysis (run with HCW, 300°C, 100bar) showing several oxygenates (mainly carboxylic acids and phenol derivatives stemming from lignin destruction) besides some O- and N-heterocycles. The chemical composition (based on area%) of the HCO and LCO bio-oils obtained from those analyses (Table 2 ) showed the presence of mainly furan derivatives and phenol-based products in HCO and carboxylic acids and carbohydrate-based products in LCO."
9,Conclusions,"The investigations showed that lignocellulosic biomass, i.e. wheat straw, could be effectively converted into liquid products (bio-oil) under hydrothermal conditions. A water–ethanol mixture (50:50 (v/v)) was found to be most effective at 300°C and 100bar as compared to neat water in terms of higher bio-oil yield (30.4%) and HHV (27.8MJ/kg). A heterogeneous Ru/H-Beta catalyst used for deeper deoxygenation in the presence of hydrogen revealed increased HHV values above 30MJ/kg. The received high caloric oils may have potential for further refinery operations and can be applied as additives or blending components in petroleum based fuels for transport application. Otherwise, useful chemical products such as furan derivatives and phenol-based compounds can be isolated from bio-oils. In particular, the HCO share of the oils may have future economic potential as petrochemical substitution options for a variety of products, e.g. monomers for sustainable bio-plastics, pharmaceuticals or fragrances. However, further upgrading of such bio-oils is necessary for their direct application. In addition, the use of heterogeneous catalysts showed potential to access value-added products but further research is needed in particular on repeated use, deactivation issues and long-term properties. The applied reactor concept showed reliable processing for larger units with feeding biomass-water–ethanol slurries."
