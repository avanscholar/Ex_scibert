0,Introduction,"Red wine consumption has been an indispensable part of the etiquette culture at dinner table in some countries like China, due to the occurring of the abundant bioactive compounds of wine, such as phenols, tanins and flavoniods. And the compounds usually originate from three ways, i.e. from the transferring of the compounds occurring in grapes, the yeast metabolism of the substrates like alcohols and higher alcohols (HA), and the re-generations among the compounds during wine ageing [1]. Regarding the volatile fraction of wine, it contains not only the alcohol, but also the metabolites of alcoholic fermentation, such as higher alcohols and their acetates, diacetyl and acetaldehyde [2]. Although not all of them contribute to wine aroma, yet the variety of chemical families gives wine of a tremendous aromatic complexity [3]. Taking the fusel alcohol acetates as an example, it is known to be essential for the wine fruitiness [2,4,5]. HA are also known as fusel alcohols, and the word of fusel refers to a fraction smelling very strong and bad, which is obtained from the distillation of the fermented products [6]. During the fermentation process, the HA like the 2-methylpropan-1-ol, 2-methylbutan-1-ol, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, 2-phenylethan-1-ol and propan-1-ol, are usually metabolized by yeast either from the grape amino acids via the Ehrlich pathway or directly from sugars. To be specific, 65% of HA derived from amino acids and 35% from sugars under the enological conditions [7]. In addition, the formation of HA can also be influenced by several factors like yeast strain, fermentation temperature, pH of must, aeration, and the variety and maturity of grape berries [8]. HA are present in total concentrations ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 g/L in white wines and between 0.4 and 1.4 g/L in red wines [9]. Compared with the claims that at the total concentrations below 300 mg/L, higher alcohols could positively contribute to the wine aromatic profile, like increasing the fruity and flowery notes, and the aroma complexity, while at levels above 400 mg/L a negative effect of the apparition of pungent and unpleasant notes would be noted [4,9,10], so it can be concluded that the HA in wines probably contribute a negative effect on the aroma profile, since most of the HA are present at concentrations above their olfactory thresholds, i.e. the content of HA should be reduced to make them positively contribute to the aromatic profile of wines. At present, there are two solutions available for decreasing the content of HA, the first is to regulate the factors influencing the formation of HA during the fermentation so as to control the formation to a lower level [1,11–14], and the second is to remove or degrade the HA occurring in wines by means of physical or chemical techniques. As a relatively low-cost, eco-friendly and non-thermal processing novel technology [15], ultrasound has been regarded as the most promising technique for accelerating the process of wine aging, due to the fact that some chemical reactions could be effectively triggered and accelerated by the acoustic cavitation, which resembles the occurrence in natural wine aging process [16–21]. In addition, studies conducted in our group have also revealed that ultrasound irradiation could significantly influence some of the physicochemical properties of wine, such as the changing of phenolic compounds and wine color, and the organoleptic properties like astringency and bitterness [22–27], while the studies were mainly focused on the flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins and organic acids. To the best of our knowledge, no literature was available about the effect of ultrasound irradiation on the higher alcohols, since they are also crucial for the organoleptic property of wine. In this study, the main purpose was therefore to investigate the effects of ultrasound irradiation on the changes of higher alcohols by employing the response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the three ultrasound parameters including ultrasonic time, power and temperature. In addition, a model wine system was constructed so as to explore the changing mechanism of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound. All the studies may help to understand the effects of ultrasound irradiation on improving the wine sensory properties."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals The sample of a Cabernet Sauvignon red wine was supplied by the Sanxian Winery (Shaanxi Province, China) and used throughout this research. All the chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade. N-propyl alcohol, isobutanol, isopentanol, n-pentanol, and anhydrous ethanol were all chromatographic purity (Tianjin Komeo Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China). The double-distilled water was used throughout the experiment."
3,Ultrasound equipment and treatment conditions,"2.2 Ultrasound equipment and treatment conditions Ultrasonic treatments were conducted in an ultrasound bath (SB-500DTY, Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China), with the frequencies of 25, 28, 40 and 59 kHz within the variable powers of 500 W. For each experiment set, 20 mL of red wine sample was placed in a 100 mL bottle sealed by parafilm, and then the bottle was fixed in a designated position of the ultrasound bath for treatment. The ultrasonic effects on the higher alcohols concentration were firstly investigated with the following variables by using the one factor experiment design. To be specific, for the variable of ultrasound power (150, 200, 300, 400, and 450 W), the other conditions were fixed at the frequency of 40 kHz, 30 min of exposure time, 30 °C of temperature; for the variations of ultrasound frequency (25, 40 and 59 kHz), the other parameters were fixed at 300 W, 30 min and 30 °C; regarding the temperature variation (20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 °C), the conditions of 40 kHz, 300 W and 30 min were fixed; and when the time changed from 10 to 50 min, the fixed conditions were as 40 kHz, 300 W and 30 °C."
4,Experimental design and analysis,"2.3 Experimental design and analysis Based on the results obtained from the one factor experiments, three independent variables were selected including ultrasound temperature (°C, A), power (W, B) and exposure time (min, C), and each variable was set at the three levels, with the frequency fixed at 40 kHz. Finally, a three-variable, three-level Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to optimize the ultrasound conditions so as to obtain the lowest concentration of higher alcohols (the response, Y). A total of 17 experiments were listed in Table 3, and each experiment was performed in triplicate."
5,GC analysis of higher alcohols,"2.4 GC analysis of higher alcohols Gas chromatography analysis was conducted with the instrument of GC-2010PLUS (Japan SHIMADZU Co., Ltd.), and separated using a column of HP-INNO-WAX (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm, Japan SHIMADZU Co., Ltd.). The temperature of the gasification chamber and detector were all set at 210 °C. The oven temperature was firstly maintained at 30 °C for 1 min, and increased to 60 °C at a increase rate of 5 °C/min and held for 1 min, then continuously increased to 100 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and held for 1 min. Helium was used as the carrier, and its flow rate was of 40 mL/min. 1 μL aliquot wine sample was injected and the split ratio was of 28:1."
6,Preparation of model wine,"2.5 Preparation of model wine All the glass and plastic items were soaked in 10% (v/v) the nitric acid solution for at least 12 h and then rinsed with double-distilled water. 500 mL of ferrous stock solution was prepared by dissolving 2.502 g ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and adjusted with 2 mL of 0.5% (v/v) sulfuric acid. 500 mL of cupric stock solution was prepared with containing 3.20 g of anhydrous cupric sulfate. In addition, 12% (v/v) ethanol solution, 4 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution and 0.5% (v/v) sulfuric acid were prepared, respectively [25,28]. 2.5.1 Effect of tartaric acid on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine In order to investigate the effect of tartaric acid on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine, different weights of tartaric acid (0, 2.70 and 27 g) were respectively added to 1 L of the 12% ethanol solution (v/v), which contained 1 mL of n-propyl alcohol, 1 mL of isobutanol, 1 mL of isopentanol, 1 mL of n-pentanol, 5 mL of ferrous ion solution and 5 mL of copper ion solution, respectively. 2.5.2 Effect of ethanol concentration on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine The mixture solution containing 1 mL of n-propyl alcohol, 1 of mL isobutanol, 1 mL of isopentanol, 1 mL of n-pentanol, 2.70 g of tartaric acid and 5 mL of copper ion solution and 5 mL of ferrous ion solution, were added to 1 L of the aqueous solution, 6% ethanol solution and 12% ethanol solution, respectively. Then the effect of ethanol concentration on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine was investigated. 2.5.3 Effect of iron ions on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine 2.70 g of tartaric acid, 1 mL n-propyl alcohol, 1 mL isobutanol, 1 mL isopentanol, 1 mL n-pentanol and 5 mL copper ion liquor were added to the solution without ferrous ion, containing 5 mL ferrous ion liquor and 50 mL ferrous ion liquor, respectively. Thereafter, the above mixed solutions were respectively put into the 12% ethanol aqueous solution (v/v) and the total volume was 1L for each experiment set. 2.5.4 Effect of cupric ions on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine The effects of cupric ions on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols were conducted by adding o mL copper ion, 5 mL and 50 mL of copper ion solution into the model solution, respectively. And the model solution comprised the 12% ethanol solution, 1 mL of n-propyl alcohol, 1 mL isobutanol, 1 mL isopentanol, 1 mL n-pentanol, 2.70 g tartaric acid and 5 mL ferrous ion solution, and the total volume was 1 L. 2.5.5 Effect of free radicals on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine Generally, mannitol is regarded as a good scavenger for free radicals, so the different mannitols (0, 1, 2 and 3 g) were added into the 1L of 12% model ethanol solution, which contained 2.70 g of tartaric acid, 5 mL ferrous ion, 5 mL copper ion, 1 mL n-propyl alcohol, 1 mL isobutanol, 1 mL isopentanol, and 1 mL n-pentanol, so as to investigate the effect of free radicals generated from the ultrasound cavitation on the changes of higher alcohols in a model wine. In addition, for all the model solutions, the value of pH was adjusted to 3.4 ± 0.1 with 5% (v/v) sodium hydroxide or sulphuric acid to make them resembled those of red wines. The above-optimized working parameters of ultrasound were employed to treat all the model solutions."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis The results were statistically analyzed by calculating the mean and standard deviation, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using the SPSS statistics software. Microsoft Office Excel and Origin 9 pro were used to process the related data and draw graphs."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Standard curves and correlation coefficients of four standards of higher alcohols determined by GC,"3.1 Standard curves and correlation coefficients of four standards of higher alcohols determined by GC The higher alcohols of wines were determined by the GC instrument, and one typical chromatogram was shown in Fig. 1 , which demonstrates that four peaks could be identified as the compounds of n-propyl alcohol, isobutanol, isopentanol and n-pentanol by comparing the retention time with the correspondingly injected standard, respectively. The contents of all the identified compounds were calculated according to the curves constructed with the concentrations of the standards against their corresponding peak areas. As shown in Table 1 , the contents of standard higher alcohols highly correlate with the peak areas and all the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.999, indicating that it is feasible to determine the changes of higher alcohol according to constructed curve in the following studies, so as to investigate the effects of ultrasound irradiation on the higher alcohols of wines."
10,Effects of independent ultrasound variables on the total contents of higher alcohols in the red wine,"3.2 Effects of independent ultrasound variables on the total contents of higher alcohols in the red wine Ultrasonic powers of 150, 200, 300, 400, and 450 W were carried out to study their effects on the concentration of higher alcohols in red wines, while the other conditions were fixed at 40 kHz of frequency, 30 min of exposure time and 30 °C of temperature. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the total concentrations of higher alcohols decreased greatly in comparison with the untreated wine samples, which demonstrates a degradation effect on the higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound irradiation. To be specific, the degradation rates were 25.72%, 25.46%, 39.07%, 30.22% and 27.93% with the power variations from 150 to 450 W, respectively. Furthermore, the power of 300 W exerted the maximum degradation rate among all the powers employed. In general, the degradation of higher alcohols might be attributed to the ultrasound cavitation, which consequently results in a greater sonochemical effect on the stability of higher alcohols [29]. In addition, higher power would not only strengthen the cavitation energy, but also reduce the threshold, causing a higher degradation rate. In the meantime, not the highest power can produce the highest cavitation, since it could be influenced by many factors, which can be proved by the degradation rate at 450 W. In order to further explore the optimal power to reduce the concentrations of higher alcohols, the power variables of 150, 300 and 450 W were chosen as the three design levels in the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the degradation rates induced by ultrasound were 24.44%, 32.84% and 28.49%, when the employed three frequencies were fixed at 25, 40 and 59 kHz, respectively. The results indicate that ultrasound frequency had a definite effect on the degradation of higher alcohols, and 40 kHz performed the great influence. Generally, the effect of frequency on the degradation depends on the amounts of free radicals generated by the collapsing bubbles of ultrasonic cavitation. Considering the practical operation, the frequency was not chosen as a variation in the experiments of response surface optimization. Based on the experimental results in Fig. 2(c), a definite conclusion could be deduced that the higher alcohols could be degraded, and the degradation rates were of 18.49%, 23.85%, 28.15%, 29.41% and 16.33% with the corresponding time of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 min, respectively. A decreasing trend was demonstrated with the increase of time from 10 to 40 min about the total concentrations of higher alcohols in wine, followed by an increase at the 50 min. So the three design levels selected for the time variable were 10, 30 and 50 min. Fig. 2(d) illustrated that the concentrations of the total higher alcohols were significantly affected by the ultrasound temperature, and the degradation rates were of 23.98%, 32.77%, 28.15%, 15.07%, 17.13% and 15.29% at the corresponding temperatures of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the temperature of 25 °C had the maximum effect on the decrease of the total higher alcohols. Generally, the higher the temperature, the larger the vapor pressure of the solutes, which allows the solutes easily diffuse into the bubbles and causes a reduction of the collapse temperature and degradation rate, contributing to explain the decreased degradation rate with the temperature increase from 25 to 45 °C. So the temperature of 20, 25 and 30 °C were selected as the variations in the response surface optimization experiments. In a word, all the results indicate that the total concentrations of higher alcohols of wines could be definitely influenced by the ultrasound parameters like power, frequency, time and temperature. Compared to the total contents (about 640 mg/L) of the four higher alcohols in the untreated wine samples, the total contents were significantly lowered in the ultrasonically treated wine samples. Considering the effects of excessive higher alcohols on the quality of wine, the decrease might suggest that the sensory properties of wine could be improved, i.e. the ultrasound could modify the organoleptic characters of wine by lowering the contents of higher alcohols. In the meantime, the parameters affecting the ultrasound efficiency should be optimized so as to obtain a maximum lowering degree of higher alcohols in wines."
11,Response surface optimization of the ultrasound conditions,"3.3 Response surface optimization of the ultrasound conditions As shown in Table 2 , there are 17 runs in the optimization design, and the multivariate regression analysis of the results was carried out by using the Design-Expert V 8.0.6 software. A quadratic regression model was established for the coded level of ultrasound temperature (A), power (B) and time (C) with the total concentrations of higher alcohols in red wines as the response (Y). The results were as follows: Y = 341.04 - 29.05A + 9.83B - 10.63C + 41.26AB + 44.88AC - 43.28BC - 8.14A 2 + 44.09 B 2 + 40.75 C 2 Table 3 is the ANOVA analysis results of the response surface optimized experiments. The model of P < 0.0001 indicates that the model difference is extremely significant, while the missing item of P is 0.6711 (>0.05), indicating that the difference is not significant, i.e. the regression model could fit with the actual situation and explain the relationship between the response values and various factors. Therefore, the regression model was used to analyze the experimental results. Fig. 3 (a) demonstrates the effects of ultrasonic temperature (A) and power (B) on the total contents of higher alcohols with the ultrasonic time fixed at 30 min. At a designated ultrasonic temperature, the total contents of the four higher alcohols increased slightly with the increase of ultrasound power. And for a fixed power, the contents reduced with the increases of temperature, and the minimal content was obtained at the conditions of 30 °C, 150 W and 30 min. The interaction between the ultrasonic temperature (A) and time (C) is shown in Fig. 3(b) with the power kept at 300 W. For a designated ultrasound time, the contents reduced with the increase of temperature. When the temperature was designated at a fixed value, the time showed a quadratic effect on the responses, and the minimum contents was obtained at conditions of 10 min, 30 °C and 300 W, and all the results were in accordance with those in Table 3 . Fig. 3(c) shows the effects of ultrasonic power (B) and time (C) on the total contents of the four higher alcohols at the temperature of 25 °C. The results indicate that power and time displayed a quadratic effect on the response, which is also consistent with the results in Table 3, and the minimal content could be obtained at 30 min, 300 W and 25 °C. The optimal conditions obtained with the response surface methodology (RSM) were as follows according the above regressed formula: ultrasound time of 30 min, power of 150 W and temperature of 30 °C. To compare the predicted result (296.84 mg/L) with the practical value, the verification experiment was performed according to the deduced optimum conditions. The mean value (mg/L) of 306.75 ± 0.42 (n = 3), obtained from actual experiments, demonstrated the validity of the RSM model, since there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference between 296.84 and 306.75. The strong correlation between the actual and the predicted results confirmed that the optimized model could be used to deduce the expected optimization."
12,Exploration of factors influencing the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound in a model wine,"3.4 Exploration of factors influencing the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound in a model wine In a whole, the results obtained in the above sections indicate that the total contents of higher alcohols of wines could be greatly reduced by ultrasound irradiation, while the decreasing mechanism of the higher alcohols remains unclear by now. Moreover, due to the complexity of the wine compositions, it is very difficult to understand all the influencing factors in this complex solution, so the model wine solutions were constructed with the addition of tartaric acid, ethanol, Fe2+, Cu2+ and mannitol, which are the main components of wine or very crucial to the chemical reactions in wine, so as to investigate their effects on the ultrasonic degradation of higher alcohols in the following experiments. 3.4.1 Effect of tartaric acid addition on the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound in a model wine As shown in Fig. 4 , the control is defined as the model wine solution without containing tartaric acid, and the contents of the four higher alcohols in the control all decreased greatly after ultrasound irradiation, suggesting the ultrasonic degradation on the higher alcohols, which might be attributed to the cavitation bubbles produced by ultrasound, the rapid alternation of rarefaction cycle and the compression cycle, consequently resulting in a large amount of cavitation bubbles to burst and send out energy [29]. During this process, the simultaneously local higher temperature (>5000 °C) and pressure (>1000 atm) would be generated in and around the interior of acoustic cavities, subsequently releasing various free radicals like hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals, and triggering the chains of chemical reactions [30,31]. Apart from the role of free radicals, the mechanical effect of ultrasound could also increase the collision among the molecules and the diffusion coefficients, thus accelerating the degradation of the higher alcohols. However, when the model wine solution was added with the tartaric acid, the contents of higher alcohols also decreased, but the reduced amounts were relatively lower than those of the control group, which might indicate that the tartaric acid rarely contributed to the degradation of higher alcohols. On the contrary, it might inhibit the degradation of higher alcohols to a certain extent. Furthermore, the degradation of the higher alcohols by ultrasound was a little smaller, when the added concentration of tartaric acid was 2.7 g/L. In comparison with other higher alcohols, the degradation of n-propyl alcohol was not greatly influenced by the addition of tartaric acid in the model wine. Generally, the possible reason that the tartaric acid would influence the ultrasound’s degradation on the higher alcohols might be attributed to its direct reaction with the alcohols, or the oxidized products from tartaric acid like glyoxylic acid due to the ultrasound cavitation, consequently restricting the degradation of higher alcohols [30]. 3.4.2 Effect of ethanol on the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound irradiation in a model solution Ethanol is the primary component of red wine with a concentration of about 12% (v/v), so it is very necessary to study its effect on the ultrasonic degradation of higher alcohols. As shown in Fig. 5 , the control group was constructed as the model wine solution without addition of ethanol, when the ethanol concentration was at 12% in the model solution, and the degradation rates were 33.88%, 25.10%, 25.37% and 27.65% for the higher alcohols of isobutanol, isopentanol, n-propyl alcohol and n-pentanol, respectively. Compared with the results of the model solution only treated by ultrasound but without addition of ethanol, a further decreasing trend could be observed for the contents of the four kinds of higher alcohols with the addition of ethanol, suggesting that the ethanol did greatly promote the degradation of higher alcohols by ultrasound irradiation, although the degradation rates of isopentanol and n-pentanol accelerated by ethanol were significantly lower than those of isobutanol and n-propyl alcohol. The reasons that the ethanol could accelerate the ultrasonic degradation on higher alcohols might be attributed to the amounts of free radicals mediated by acoustic cavitation, and the initiated chain reactions by the free radicals. Generally, when the volatile solvents exist in the ultrasound solution, their volatility would directly affect the concentration of the cavitation bubbles and the free radicals. With the increase of ethanol addition, a large number of ethanol molecules would firstly surround the interface of the bubbles, and then react with the generated free radicals due to the nonlinear oscillating of the bubbles. Thereafter, the adducts like the 1-hydroxyethyl radicals would further attack the near other compounds like higher alcohols, causing the decrease of the higher alcohols [32]. 3.4.3 Effect of ferrous cation on the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound in a model wine Iron plays an important role in the process of wine oxidation, and previous studies revealed that the oxidation of polyphenols in wine depends on the iron’s involvement [22,33,34], i.e. electrons were transferred from polyphenols to the oxygen through the intermediate redox cycle of iron (III)/iron (II) couple, while the effect of ferrous on the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound remains unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the role of iron ions in the ultrasonic degradation of higher alcohols. As shown in Fig. 6 , the control group was the model wine without the addition of Fe2+, and the higher alcohols in control group were similarly degraded by the ultrasound irradiation. When the concentration of the added iron ions was 0.09 mmol/L, which is a normal content for many red wines, the concentrations of the four higher alcohols were further reduced in comparison with the results of model wine with ultrasound treatment and without the addition of Fe2+. And the maximum degradation rate of isobutanol was 33.88%, and the decreases of isopentanol, n-propyl alcohol and n-pentanol were 25.10%, 25.37% and 27.65%, respectively. These results confirmed that the ultrasound effects on the degradation of higher alcohols could definitely be reinforced by adding a suitable content of iron ions in the model wine, since excessive concentrations of iron ions would limit the degradation of higher alcohols. All these results might be attributed to the Fenton reaction induced by iron ions or the formation of iron (III)/iron (II) carboxylate complex, which could be changed into the corresponding carboxylate radicals, subsequently reacting with higher alcohols and resulting in a decrease of their concentrations [25,34]. However, its specific mechanism should be further studied. 3.4.4 Effect of copper (II) on the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound in a model wine As can be seen from Fig. 7 , the copper (II) in the model wine had a significant effect on the ultrasonic degradation of the higher alcohols, such as the n-propyl alcohol and n-pentanol, especially when the content of Cu2+ was 0.02 mmol/L. In a whole, under the ultrasound conditions, the contents of higher alcohols decreased at first and then increased with the increasing of cupric ions concentration, which is similar to those of iron ions. Generally, the metal ions are regarded to accelerate the autoxidation reactions by increasing the reaction rates between molecular oxygen and the compounds like phenols. For the oxygen, it has a triplet ground state, while the chemical compounds have the single ground states, so the direct reactions between them were prohibited from spinning. Therefore, the triple oxygen must be activated before its reaction, and it can be achieved through the transition metal ions like iron and copper by donating a single electron in wine solution, resulting in the production of oxygen radical intermediates, which may be further reduced to hydrogen peroxide in the form of metal complexes [35]. And the hydrogen peroxide itself can be reduced by iron (II) or copper (I) in the Fenton reaction [36]. All these results might be used to explain the reason why metal ions had the accelerating impact on the ultrasonic degradation of higher alcohols in wines. 3.4.5 Effect of mannitol on the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound in a model wine Mannitol is an effective scavenger of free radicals [32], so it can be used to tentatively study the role of free radicals triggered by ultrasound cavitation in the degradation of higher alcohols. As shown in Fig. 8 , the concentrations of higher alcohols in the model wine were significantly reduced after the treatment of ultrasound, especially for the isobutanol and n-propyl alcohol, and their degradation rates were 22.97% and 20.49%, respectively. In contrast, the changes of higher alcohols were not significant, when the model wines including with the mannitol were ultrasonically treated, suggesting that the mannitol terminated the degradation of higher alcohols mediated by ultrasound. The reason why the mannitol can restrict the further degradation of higher alcohols caused by ultrasound might be that the free radicals induced by ultrasound irradiation were scavenged by the mannitols, only a little number of free radicals were formed, and could further oxidize the higher alcohols, resulting in the decrease of contents. That is to say, the mannitol in wines could inhibit the degradation of higher alcohols by scavenging the free radicals generated from the ultrasound irradiation. In other words, free radicals produced from the ultrasound played an important role in the degradation of higher alcohols of wines."
13,"Analysis of the effects of tartaric acid, ethanol, iron, copper and mannitol on the ultrasonic degradation of higher alcohols by heat map in a model wine","3.5 Analysis of the effects of tartaric acid, ethanol, iron, copper and mannitol on the ultrasonic degradation of higher alcohols by heat map in a model wine According to the color distribution in the heat map, the effects of the tartaric acid, ethanol, iron, copper and mannitols on the ultrasonic decreasing of higher alcohols in a model wine could be clearly observed. As shown in Fig. 9 , the concentration of higher alcohols in the model liquor was reduced to a great extent after being ultrasonically treated. Generally, the transition metal ions (such as iron and copper) play an important role for wine ageing and modification of sensory properties of wine. It can be found from the Fig. 9 that the degradation rate of higher alcohols in the model wine without metal ions is lower, especially for the isobutanol and isopentanol, and in the model solution containing only one kind of metal ion, the degradation rate of higher alcohols is generally lower, especially for the isobutanol and n-pentanol. On the contrary, in the model liquor with the appropriate concentration of metal ions, the degradation rate of higher alcohols is higher. The degradation of higher alcohols in the model liquor with the tartaric acid is significant, especially for the isobutanol. Generally speaking, tartaric acid could be degraded into glyoxylic acid, consequently reacted with the higher alcohols and resulted in the decrease of higher alcohols. Ethanol in wines might be oxidized to the 1-hydroxyethyl radicals by the hydroxyl radicals from the ultrasound irradiation, and then further being oxidized to the acetaldehyde, consequently reacting with the higher alcohols or their degradation products. So the degradation of higher alcohols is significant in the model liquor containing the 12% ethanol. Regarding the experimental results containing mannitol, the degradation rate of higher alcohols is not significant after the free radicals being scavenged by the mannitol, i.e. the free radicals produced from ultrasound play an important role in the degradation of higher alcohols in wines. And all the results are in accordance with those in Section 3.4."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, it can be concluded that the total concentrations of higher alcohols of wines can be reduced by the ultrasound irradiation, and the maximum decreasing amount could be achieved by optimizing the ultrasound working parameters like power, time and temperature. Considering the negative effects of excessive higher alcohols on the sensory properties of wine, the decrease might suggest that the wine quality, especially the organoleptic character, could be modified by employing a suitable ultrasound irradiation. Regarding the ultrasound’s influencing mechanism on decreasing the higher alcohols, the results obtained from the model wine indicate that the decrease could be definitely affected by the main factors like tartaric acid, ethanol concentration, ferrous, cupric ions and mannitols in red wines, which might be attributed to the free radicals generated from ultrasound cavitation and its subsequently initiated chain reactions. In a word, all these results may help to understand the effects of ultrasound irradiation on improving the wine sensory properties, thus playing a positive role in the production of high quality wines. However, the specific mechanism should be further investigated about the different changes of the individual higher alcohol under the treatment of ultrasound."
