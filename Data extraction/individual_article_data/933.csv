0,Introduction,"Currently, the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds into the corresponding amines is widely used in the organic and petrochemical synthesis. Aromatic amines, namely, aniline and its derivatives, are widely used in production of paints as well as in chemical industry as organic intermediates, in manufacturing of analgetics, antihistamine agents, tranquilizers, etc., in pharmaceutical industry [1,2]. Thus, 4-aminophenol (4-AP), the product of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction, is included into the composition of analgesic and antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol, acetanilide, phenacetin, etc [2]. The 4-AP is also used as a corrosion inhibitor in paints, as a dye for fur and feathers, anti-corrosion lubricant in fuels for two-stroke engines. Moreover, the conversion of highly toxic 4-NP into 4-AP characterized by low toxicity is a topical environmental challenge [3,4]. The nitro compound hydrogenation to amines is usually carried out in gas or liquid phase with hydrogen on Ni-based catalysts at 50–200 °C and 5–100 bar [5–7]. The noble metals Pd, Pt, Rh, and Cu are also used as catalysts [2,5–7]. The conditions employed are rather severe and do not allow the hydrogenation of polynitro compounds due to their instability and high heat effect of the reaction. In the hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds, the use of platinum-, palladium- or nickel-based catalysts can lead to the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring [2,8,9]. In general, the search for optimal reaction parameters and inexpensive efficient catalysts that allow the process to occur under milder conditions is topical. At present, much attention is paid to the catalytic reduction of nitro compounds, in particular 4-NP, with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) representing an effective and environmentally friendly method [4]. Over the past few years, various nanocatalysts based on noble (Pt, Ag, Au, Pd) and transition (Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, Cu) metals [10–17] have been investigated in 4-NP reduction to 4-AP under mild conditions. Among the latter group, copper has attracted considerable attention. The Cu-containing catalysts potentially can be rather cheap and selective [16,18–20]. Besides, the catalytic characteristics of Cu and Cu2O NPs in the 4-NP hydrogenation are comparable to those of nanocatalysts based on noble metals [16]. Today, most catalysts are produced by chemical methods that require complex synthesis processes, high temperature conditions, expensive equipment, organic reducing agents, surfactants and/or closures [21–24]. The obtained NPs usually form aggregates and require stabilization with various surfactants resulting in a decrease in their catalytic activity. A suitable alternative to synthesize the nanocatalysts, especially for the laboratory studies, is the method of pulsed laser ablation in liquid (LAL) that has been effectively developing in recent decades [25–28]. The LAL is a convenient, economical and easily controlled method to obtain the high-purity and ultrafine nanomaterials [27,28]. Thus, catalysts prepared by the LAL were used in the photocatalytic decomposition of phenol [29], oxidation of CO and ammonia [26,30], propylene glycol oxidation [31], and the NaBH4- or HCOOH-assisted reduction of assorted environmental pollutants in an aqueous medium [32–36] including nigrosine, potassium ferricyanide(III), hexavalent chromium, congo red, and methylene blue and 4-NP reduction. Previously we have shown that the LAL is a promising method for the controlled production of CuOx NPs. The solvent used in the synthesis was found an important factor to control their composition, morphology and stability, both of the particles themselves and of the resulting suspensions [37]. Copper-containing colloids obtained by the LA in distilled water are the most attractive in terms of simplicity of production and environmental friendliness but are unstable. They tend to form large secondary Cu2O particles that are further oxidized to CuO. At the same time, the colloids obtained in ethanol showed relatively high stability and invariability of the size and structure of the NPs during the storage [37]. However, the use of Cu-containing colloids obtained by LA in ethanol as a catalyst may be limited by the low synthesis productivity of the LA in ethanol. In addition, hydrogenation catalysts are characterized by lower catalytic activity in non-aqueous solvents [2,38]. In this regard, the use of mixed aqueous-alcoholic solutions as a medium for the LAL can be of interest in terms of both preparation of stable colloids and their application in catalysis. The aim of the present work was to obtain the stable Cu-containing colloids by LA in water-alcohol mixtures and to study their catalytic properties in 4-NP hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Colloid preparation method,"2.1 Colloid preparation method The dispersions were synthesized according to the procedure and using the unit described in Ref. [37]. A pulsed neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used as a radiation source generating radiation with a wavelength of 1064 nm, a nanosecond pulse duration of 7 ns, a repetition rate of 20 Hz, and a pulse energy of 150 mJ. A plate of high-purity metallic copper (99.98 % pure) with linear dimensions of 30 × 10 × 5 mm was used as the target material placed in a beaker with a liquid of 20 ml or 50 ml. The thickness of the liquid layer between the target and the glass did not exceed 5 mm; such conditions minimized the effects of a possible secondary interaction of the NPs with the laser radiation. Prior to the ablation process, the target surface was treated with an abrasive to remove the oxide layer, then the mass of the Cu metal target was measured, and the volume of the solvent where the ablation target was placed into was recorded. Distilled water and 96 % ethanol with the density of 0.807 kg cm−3 were used as solvents. The water–alcohol mixtures were prepared by mixing, and the required mass content of the alcohol was controlled by measuring the density of the obtained solutions. The solvent volume was 20 ml, and the ablation time was 30 min. The colloids of CuOx NPs with the concentration of 50–100 mg L−1 were obtained depending on the used solvent. Both fresh colloids and those aged for 3 and 50 days were considered. Aging of the colloids was carried out in the dark in 15 mL glass vials closed with polyethylene lids."
3,Characterization methods,"2.2 Characterization methods The obtained colloids were studied by the optical spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy at different time intervals depending on the color change of the colloid and the precipitate formation. To study the phase composition by the XRD method, the colloids were dried on a glass surface at room temperature. The absorption of the colloids in the UV–vis region of the spectrum was studied using the Cary 100 Scan spectrophotometer (Australia) in quartz cuvettes in the range of 190−900 nm. The stability of the colloids was also controlled by the changes in the absorption spectra. An aliquot of the sample (as-prepared or aged for 50 days) was carefully taken from the top before and after the dispergating. The ultrasound (US) was applied when measuring the dispersion before taking the spectrum for the aged colloids. When studying the optical properties of the colloids after the interaction with NaBH4, 500 μL of the suspension of CuOx NPs were diluted with 1.7 mL of water, then 300 μL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution with a concentration of 0.05 mol L−1 was added. The measurements were carried out in a cuvette with an optical path length of 1 cm before and after the NaBH4 addition. The reduction conditions were as close as possible to those used in the study of the catalytic activity. To characterize the morphology, composition, and structure of the nanomaterials, the method of transmission electron microscopy was used. The imaging was carried out using the CM 12 microscope, Philips (Netherlands). The obtained colloids were supported on Cu grids with amorphous carbon coating and then dried. The particle size was estimated using the ImageJ software (LOCI, University of Wisconsin, USA). The crystal structure of the particles was studied by the XRD analysis for the powders obtained after the suspension drying. The XRD patterns were recorded on the XRD-6000 diffractometer, Shimadzu (Japan). The phase composition was identified using the PDF4 database. The quantitative content of crystalline phases and the determination of the average crystallite sizes in the samples were carried out using the PowderCell 2.4 software package."
4,Method to study catalytic properties,"2.3 Method to study catalytic properties The catalytic properties of the colloids aged for 3 and 50 days were studied by the spectrophotometric method using the CM 2203 Solar spectrophotometer (Belarus) in the ""Kinetics"" mode. In this mode, one can carry out the kinetic measurements of changes in optical density (absorption) at the given wavelengths. Two wavelengths of 400 nm and 298 nm were found to be responsible for the reagent consumption, i.e., 4-nitrophenolate ion (4-NP− ion), and the product formation, i.e., 4-AP, respectively. The experiment was carried out in a quartz cell with an optical path length of 10 mm. Distilled water (1.7 mL) was placed into the cuvette and thermostated using the built-in temperature controller. Stirring was carried out with the built-in magnetic mini-stirrer. After the temperature setting, the optical density was recorded at the basic points. Then the CuOx catalyst in the form of the suspension (15 mg L-1, 200 μL) and the as-prepared NaBH4 solution (0.05 mol L-1, 300 μL) were introduced into the cuvette. The resulting system was stirred for 2 min. Then the 4-NP solution with a given concentration (2.57 × 10-4 mol L-1, 300 μL) was added with a simultaneous recording of the absorption kinetics. In the presence of NaBH4, the 4-NP was converted into 4-NP− ion, and the solution turned from light yellow to bright yellow color. As a result of the catalytic reaction, the 4-NP− ion converted into the colorless 4-AP. The experiment duration was up to 40 min, the frequency of the optical density control was 5 s, the experiment temperature was 19 °C, the stirring rate was 300 rpm. For the system under study, the experiment temperature, the number of rotations and the concentration of the reagents were preselected taking into account the literature data and optimized experimentally to study the catalytic activity in the kinetic region (for details see Supplementary material)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Composition, structure, morphology and optical properties of CuOx NPs","3.1 Composition, structure, morphology and optical properties of CuOx NPs Colloids with different structures and morphologies of CuOx NPs were obtained using the method of pulsed laser ablation of the copper target in water-alcohol mixtures. For the obtained NPs in fresh colloids and in those aged for 3 and 50 days, the morphology, phase composition, and optical properties were studied. Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra and photographs of the suspensions. Fig. 2 presents the morphology, structure, and particle size distribution histograms for the as-prepared samples. For the samples prepared in the presence of ethanol (30–96 %), no significant change in the particle morphology was observed upon aging for 50 days (Fig. 3 ). Table S1 in the Supplementary material also shows the XRD data. 3.1.1 Colloids obtained in distilled water and alcohol According to the results of the study of the optical properties, for the colloid of CuOx NPs obtained by LA in distilled water, a change in color from green to brown is observed during the aging for 3 days and is accompanied by a corresponding change in the absorption spectra (Fig. 1). The resulting colloid coagulates rather quickly (during the first 3 days) with the formation of the precipitate that is easily redispersed when shaked. Earlier we have shown that the change in the color of the colloids obtained in distilled water upon aging is caused by the Cu2O transition to CuO [37], which is clearly seen from the optical spectroscopy data. Thus, the absorption spectrum of the fresh colloid (Fig. 1a) with the particle composition corresponding to 95 wt.% Cu2O and 5 wt.% Cu (Table S1) features a weak peak in the long-wavelength region of the spectrum at a wavelength of 630 nm that can be assigned to the peak absorption of the surface plasmon resonance of Cu (SPR Cu) NPs coated with copper oxide Cu2O formed as a result of the metal oxidation during the LAL. In the short-wavelength region of the spectrum, there are intense absorption bands at 270 and 340 nm belonging to the interband transitions of copper (I) oxide. When the colloid ages for 3 days, the absorption spectrum features the disappearance of the peak in the long-wavelength region and appearance of a broad band in the UV region of the spectrum with a wavelength of 370 nm associated with the formation of the copper (II) oxide phase [37]. The colloid obtained in water is sedimentation unstable. After the oxidation of NPs during the aging for 50 days, the precipitate is formed, and a decrease in the intensity of the absorption bands is observed in the absorption spectrum (Figure S1, before the US dispersion). According to the TEM data (Fig. 2a), in the fresh colloid with the concentration of 100 mg L−1 prepared in distilled water, the CuOx NPs are mainly characterized by the particle diameter of 10–40 nm and have a quasi-spherical and/or multi-facet shape [39–40,41], the particles form aggregates up to 100 nm. The SAED is characterized by the reflections attributed to the cubic Cu2O phase that is consistent with the XRD data indicating the presence of a predominantly crystalline Cu2O phase in the sample (Table S1). It is noteworthy that for Cu2O NPs, cubic and octahedral shapes are more typical, since they possess lower surface energy [41]. In the case of colloids with a concentration of 100 mg L−1, the formation of quasi-spherical particles (Figure S2a) is apparently a result of oxidation of Cu clusters formed upon the removal of the substance from the target surface by the laser pulse by water and oxygen dissolved under the hydrothermal conditions in the cavitation bubble. Similar pseudomorphic oxidation of spherical Cu NPs to Cu2O was observed earlier [42] and was associated with the similarity of their cubic crystal structures. For the freshly prepared aqueous colloids with a concentration above 200 mg L−1, the cubic Cu2O NPs are formed (Figure S2c) due to the aggregation and recrystallization of the primary quasi-spherical and polyhedral particles [43,44], including those resulting from the secondary interaction with the laser radiation due to a longer synthesis of the concentrated suspensions. The Cu2O NPs in the aqueous colloid rapidly agglomerate forming the Cu2O supercrystals that are further oxidized into CuO with the participation of oxygen dissolved in water, with the Cu+ oxidation to Cu2+ on the surface of the Cu2O NPs starting already during the first day according to the XPS data (for details see Supplementary material). Within 3 days, the anisotropic particles (100−500 nm long and 100−400 nm wide) with the nanoribbons at the ends are observed, and the lenticular-like particles with sizes of 150–550 nm are formed during the longer aging (Fig. 3a) that was shown in details in Ref. [37]. The resulting anisotropic and lenticular-like particles form large aggregates up to 1000 nm in size. Interestingly, the particles in the aged colloid at its natural pH = 6–6.5 are characterized by a rather high zeta potential (∼30 mV) [37]. Thus, the aggregative instability of the colloid of CuOx NPs obtained by LA in distilled water, caused by the agglomeration and subsequent oxidation of small primary Cu2O particles to large secondary CuO particles to form large aggregates, is apparently the main reason for its sedimentation instability. The CuOx colloid obtained by the LA in 96 % ethanol is characterized by a black maroon color that does not change for 50 days (Fig. 1b) indirectly indicating the absence of the phase transformations in the system. Thus, the resulting colloid is more stable in contrast to the one obtained in distilled water, but upon aging, as in the case of the aqueous colloid, the precipitate is formed. Within 50 days, the complete precipitation of the colloid particles occurs that is confirmed by an intensity drop in the absorption spectrum (Figure S1) restoring after the US treatment. According to the XRD data, the phase composition of the particles in the colloid corresponds to 35 wt% Cu2O and 65 wt% Cu (Table S1). The absorption spectrum of the colloid freshly prepared in 96 % ethanol contains the SPR Cu peak with a maximum at a wavelength of 588 nm that does not shift to longer wavelengths in the spectrum of the colloid aged for 50 days (Fig. 1a). In the UV region of the spectra, the absorption due to the scattering is accompanied by the weak bands at 250 nm and 350 nm attributed to Cu2O transitions. The HR TEM data show that the SPR peak in the spectra for colloids obtained in ethanol is attributed to the Cu NPs with the peroxide layer or Cu2O submonolayer (isolated seeds of copper oxide distributed on the NP surface) in the ethanol medium, while the UV absorption was due to the Cu2O NPs presenting in the sample [37]. The position of the SPR peak in our case (concentration of 50 mg L−1, irradiation time of 30 min) indicates the formation of Cu NPs with the Cu2O submonolayer. With a longer irradiation time during the synthesis of more concentrated suspensions, the Cu NPs with the preoxide layer are formed including due to the surface interaction of the particles with the dissolved oxygen and water molecules during the secondary irradiation [37]. For the aged colloid, an increase in the absorption intensity in the UV region of the spectrum is observed and is caused by the scattering from the Cu2O layer further formed on the Cu NPs surface [45]. However, the amount of Cu2O on the Cu NPs surface in the aged suspensions remains below the peroxide layer as evidenced by the unchanged position of the SPR peak maximum. According to the TEM data (Fig. 2f), in the fresh colloid of CuOx NPs obtained by LA of Cu in 96 % ethanol, the predominantly spherical particles with a size in the range of 10–100 nm forming aggregates up to 400 nm are generated that is characteristic of Cu NPs. The SAED images show reflections of Cu2O (111) and (200), and Cu (111), which is consistent with the XRD data (Table S1). During the aging for 50 days, the morphology of the particles and their size distribution do not practically change (Fig. 3). The SAED data also indicate the presence of both cubic Cu2O and Cu phases. In general, in contrast to the colloids of CuOx NPs obtained in distilled water, those in ethanol, on the one hand, are characterized by larger particles at the initial moment, but, on the other hand, show rather high resistance to particle oxidation and the formation of large secondary particles during the aging. The formation of larger particles in the initial colloid is apparently associated with the peculiarities of the growth process of metal particles obtained during the plasma cooling at the initial stages of the LAL. The high resistance of the formed Cu particles towards deep oxidation during the suspension aging was shown to be caused by the competitive adsorption mechanism including the ethanol sorption on the particle surface preventing the rapid dissociative oxygen adsorption or interaction of Cu+ ions with the surface hydroxyl groups [37]. Thus, the main reason for the sedimentation instability of the colloids obtained in ethanol is apparently the weak electrostatic stabilization of the relatively large particles in the non-aqueous solvent with lower dielectric permeability. 3.1.2 Colloids obtained in water-alcohol solutions For all colloids obtained in water-alcohol solutions, no change in the color of the solution is observed during the aging for 50 days (Fig. 1b) indirectly indicating the absence of phase transformations in the system, while the water/alcohol ratio in the solution determines the sedimentation stability of the colloids (Figure S1). The data of optical spectroscopy (Fig. 1a) and TEM (Fig. 2) for the samples obtained in water-alcohol solutions confirm the resistance of the particles to deep phase transitions and morphological changes. Specifically, the sedimentation stable colloids were obtained in water-alcohol solutions with alcohol concentrations of 30 % and 50 %, which is confirmed by the absence of the precipitate in the colloids aged for 50 days, and the identity of their absorption spectra before and after the US treatment (Figure S1). The resulting colloids had a brownish-green and emerald color, respectively, for the solutions with alcohol concentrations of 30 % and 50 % that did not change over a long period of time (50 days). The TEM results for CuOx NPs in the freshly prepared colloid in the water-alcohol solution with the 30 % alcohol concentration (Fig. 2b) indicate the formation of pseudospherical NPs with the diameter predominantly in the range of 10−90 nm forming large aggregates up to 210 nm in size. In the freshly prepared colloid in the water-alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 50 % (Fig. 2c), the CuOx NPs also have a pseudospherical shape, but are characterized by the finer size and the narrow particle size distribution (the particle diameter is predominantly in the range of 10−40 nm). Small particles also form large aggregates up to 160 nm in size. Large (>50 nm) NPs have a pronounced jagged surface (inset in Fig. 2c) indicating that they are the secondary particles formed by the agglomeration of the small primary particles. This is also clearly visible in the SEM images of the large particles (see Supplementary material, Figure S3). The reflections of Cu2O(111) and (211) as well as those of Cu(111) and (200) are found in the SAED particle images for both freshly prepared samples. The XRD data (Table S1) also indicate the presence of both cubic Cu2O and Cu phases in the samples, with a predominant content of the former phase (72 wt% and 89 wt%, respectively, for colloids with the alcohol concentration of 30 % and 50 %). No changes in the NP morphology and the appearance of new reflections in the SAED images are observed during the long-term storage (Figure S1b). The particle size in both cases increases slightly that can be seen from the presented histograms of the particle size distribution for the aged colloids (Figs. 2b, c and 3b, c, the maximum of the distribution is shifted towards larger sizes). According to the optical spectroscopy data, in the spectra for the fresh colloids obtained in water-alcohol solutions with the alcohol concentrations of 30 % and 50 % (Fig. 1a) there is an intense SPR Cu peak with the maxima at 592 nm and 615 nm, respectively, and the bands at 270 nm and 340 nm in the UV region corresponding to the Cu2O phase transitions. High intensity of the SPR Cu peaks in the spectra for water-alcohol colloids in comparison with the colloid in ethanol is associated with the difference in the properties of the dispersion medium [45]. The difference in the position of the maximum of the SPR Cu peak for the samples is associated with the particle size and the dielectric coefficient of the surrounding medium that can be both water-ethanol solution and/or Cu2O [37,45–48]. As a result of the aging of the colloids for 50 days, the spectra exhibit a slight shift of the SPR Cu peak towards longer wavelengths by 4–7 nm (up to 596 nm and 622 nm) due to a slight increase in the Cu2O layer thickness on their Cu surface as a result of oxidation [46–48]. The relative intensity of the bands in the UV region remains practically unchanged, and the bands caused by the CuO do not appear indicating slight oxidation of the particles during the aging for a long period. An increase in the amount of alcohol in the water-alcohol solution to up to 70–90 % leads to the formation of the sedimentation unstable colloids. Thus, when using the water-alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 70 %, a dark green colloid is obtained, for which almost complete precipitation of particles is observed already within the first days after the colloid preparation, while the color of the suspension (after dispersion) does not change even after 50 days (Figure S1). According to the XRD data, the phase composition of the particles in the colloid obtained by the LA in 70 % water-ethanol solution is similar to the one in colloids obtained in solutions with lower alcohol content, and is characterized by the presence of Cu2O and Cu in the sample, with the predominant (90 wt%) content of the former phase (Table S1). According to the TEM data (Fig. 2d), the freshly prepared colloid contains rather large secondary particles of the pseudospherical shape with a pronounced surface roughness due to their polycrystallinity (Figure S3). Particle size varies mainly in the range of 10–140 nm, the particles form large aggregates up to 420 nm (Fig. 2d). With the aging of the colloid, the morphology and particle size do not change much, but the number of large aggregates increases. Electron microdiffraction images show reflections of Cu2O (110), (111), and (211) as well as those of Cu (111) and (200) that is consistent with the XRD data (Table S1). The absorption spectrum for the freshly prepared water-ethanol colloid with the alcohol concentration of 70 % is characterized by the presence of the broad SPR Cu band with the maximum at 650 nm caused by the Cu NPs covered with the Cu2O layer [45,49,50] as well as weak bands at 270 nm and 340 nm corresponding to the Cu2O phase transitions. During the aging of the colloid for 50 days, the SPR Cu band slightly shifts to the long-wavelength region of the spectrum (up to 655 nm) that may be due to the change in the structure of the Cu2O film (the appearance of the excitons providing the absorption band at ∼730 nm). Thus, the results show that the colloids of Cu NPs synthesized by the LA in water-alcohol solutions, on the one hand, are characterized by the predominant formation of the Cu2O particles (70–90 wt%) similar to the colloids obtained in distilled water. On the other hand, similar to the colloid obtained in ethanol, a sufficiently high resistance to deep oxidation of the particles and the formation of large secondary particles during the aging is observed. The predominant formation of the Cu2O phase in the course of LA in the water-ethanol mixtures is apparently due to the composition of the environment, namely, the presence of water vapor in the cavitation bubble during the formation of the primary CuOx particles in the course of the LAL of the Cu target. The high resistance of the formed Cu2O or Cu@Cu2O particles towards deep oxidation during the suspension aging is caused by the sorption of the ethanol molecules on the particle surface preventing the Cu+ interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups, which is required for the Cu2O oxidation to CuO in the suspension [37]. Thus, the composition of the water-ethanol solution in the studied range of alcohol concentration from 30 % to 70 % does not significantly affect the phase composition of the particles obtained during the LAL and the change in their phase composition and morphology during the colloid aging. At the same time, the change in the water/alcohol ratio in the solution affects the size of the resulting particles as well as the sedimentation stability of the colloids. The use of water-ethanol solutions with the alcohol concentration below 70 % increases the sedimentation stability of the resulting colloids regardless of the size of particles formed during the LAL. The observed effect is obviously related to the structure of the solvation shells of particles and the double electric layer formed in such systems. An increase in the alcohol concentration to up to 70 % and higher apparently leads to a strong decrease in the surface charge and/or the thickness of the solvation shells of the particles resulting in the aggregative instability of the colloids. The size of the particles formed during the LAL passes through a minimum with an increase in the alcohol concentration in the studied concentration range, with the smallest size corresponding to the alcohol concentration of 50 %. The observed extreme character is apparently due to the dependence of the processes of particle agglomeration and their oxidation in the cavitation bubble on the environment composition. It can be assumed that for the solutions with the low alcohol content, the formation of Cu2O particles firstly occurs followed by their agglomeration, while in the case of solutions with the high alcohol content, the secondary Cu particles are firstly formed and then oxidized. For the solution with the alcohol concentration of 50 %, the agglomeration of particles in the cavitation bubble does not occur."
7,"Catalytic properties of CuOx NPs obtained by LA of Cu in water, alcohol, and water-alcohol solutions","3.2 Catalytic properties of CuOx NPs obtained by LA of Cu in water, alcohol, and water-alcohol solutions 3.2.1 The NaBH4 effect on the state of CuOx NPs in suspensions Prior to studying the catalytic properties of the obtained samples, the effect of the reducing agent NaBH4 on the state of CuOx NPs was studied under conditions close to those in the catalytic experiments. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra for the samples before (black line) and after (red line) addition of the NaBH4 aqueous solution exemplified by the colloids aged for 50 days. The figure also shows the spectra for the fresh colloid in water that is reduced differently as compared to the corresponding aged colloids. For colloids aged for 3 days as well as for the freshly prepared colloids (except for the colloid in water) similar results are obtained. For the samples obtained in 96 % ethanol, the absorption bands of Cu2O disappear after the addition of the reducing agent, and the SPR Cu peak shifts to the short-wavelength region indicating the reduction of the NPs to metallic copper. Similar picture is observed for the freshly prepared colloid in distilled water (fresh catalyst). In the case of the colloid obtained in the aqueous alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 70 %, after the reduction the SPR Cu band is sufficiently wide with the maximum at 607 nm due to the formation of large particles. In the case of CuOx NPs obtained in water characterized by the presence of large CuO NPs, the addition of the reducing agent leads to the disappearance of the broad absorption band caused by the CuO in the UV region of the spectrum and the appearance of the broad band in the long wavelength region of the spectrum at 655–900 nm caused by the formation of the large agglomerates of Cu particles during the reduction of large CuO particles. The additional TEM and SAED studies of the morphology and composition of the NPs in the colloids after the addition of NaBH4 aqueous solution show the formation of spherical Cu particles or their agglomerates in all cases (Figure S4). In the aged colloids obtained in water, the reduction of CuOx particles with the formation of large dense agglomerates of Cu particles accompanied by the presence of Cu2O reflections in the SAED data is shown. Thus, the NaBH4 introduction naturally leads to the reduction of the CuOx particles that should be taken into account when carrying out the catalytic studies. Additional studies of the influence of the loading order of the mixture components on the kinetic dependences of the 4-NP reduction (Figure S5) show that the order of the component introduction indeed affects the results obtained that is associated with the formation of the active catalyst surface during the reduction. Therefore, in all studies, the loading was used that included the preliminary reduction of CuOx NPs by NaBH4. 3.2.2 Catalytic properties of colloids of CuOx NPs Fig. 5 and Table 1 present the catalytic properties of the colloids of CuOx NPs aged for 3 days (for details see Supplementary material). In the absence of the catalyst, the 4-NP reduction does not occur (Figure S6). The kinetic curves for all samples are characterized by the presence of the induction period followed by the starting of the 4-NP reduction for all samples. The first-order rate law (Fig. 5b) can describe the kinetic dependence observed for the reaction. Table 1 presents the values of the apparent (kapp) and specific (ks) reaction rate constants calculated from the slope of the linear correlation ln(А/А0)=-kt as well as the values of the induction period t0. The A0 and A are the optical density values at a wavelength of 400 nm corresponding to the initial (t0) and current (t) reaction times, respectively. Generally, the values of the induction period and the rate constants of the 4-NP reduction depend on the alcohol amount in the used colloid and, as a consequence, in the reaction medium: with an increase in the ethanol concentration, the induction period increases and the rate constant decreases. In particular, the sample obtained by the LA of Cu in the water-alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 30 % shows the highest catalytic activity (the effective reaction rate constant is 4.47 × 10−3 s-1) compared to the samples obtained in solutions with other water/alcohol ratios. The sample obtained in distilled water is also characterized by a rather high activity (the effective reaction rate constant is 4.36 × 10−3 s-1). Both samples are characterized by a relatively short induction period (1.9–2.7 min). The lower activity of the sample obtained in water in comparison with the sample in the aqueous alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 30 % is apparently due to the aggregative instability of the aqueous colloid accompanied by the formation of large secondary CuO/Cu2O particles. This leads to the formation of large agglomerates of Cu particles in the course of their reduction. The activity of the colloids freshly prepared in water characterized by the presence of small particles is significantly higher than that of the aged colloids (Figure S6), which confirms this assumption. For the sample prepared by LA of Cu in the water-alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 50 %, a noticeable increase in the induction period to up to 5 min and a decrease in the effective reaction rate constant to up to 2.88 × 10−3 s-1 are observed. For the sample obtained in 96 % ethanol, the induction period increases to up to 6.8 min, and the reaction rate constant is 2.96 × 10−3 s-1, which is close to the constant obtained for the sample in the water-alcohol mixture with an alcohol concentration of 50 %. Among the samples studied, the sample obtained in the water-alcohol mixture with an alcohol concentration of 70 % is characterized by the largest induction period (9.7 min) and the lowest apparent rate constant (1.62 × 10−3 s-1). The low activity of the sample in the water-alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 70 % is due to the larger Cu particles obtained during the reduction of the large initial CuOx particles in colloid (Section 2.2.1) as well as the low sedimentation stability of the colloid (complete sedimentation occurs within an hour) and, as a consequence, lower actual content of the catalyst in the portion of the colloid added to the reaction medium. Fig. 6 and Table 2 show the catalytic activity of CuOx samples aged for 50 days. In general, the samples show the same trend in catalytic properties as those after 3 days of aging. The absolute values of the induction period and effective rate constants change, which is mostly observed for the samples in water, alcohol, and the water-alcohol solution with the ethanol concentration of 70 %. In general, the catalytic properties of CuOx NPs in colloids obtained by the LAL indicate their high activity in the 4-NP reduction that is comparable to or exceeding the one of CuOx catalysts obtained by other methods as well as other investigated catalysts based on oxides and noble metals (Table 3 ) making them attractive for practical use. For the sample obtained in distilled water, there is a noticeable decrease in the apparent rate constant to up to 3.5 × 10−3 s-1 associated with the further increase in the size and the change in the morphology of particles during the colloid aging. For the samples in the water-alcohol solution with the alcohol concentration of 70 % and in ethanol, on the contrary, an increase in the apparent rate constant is observed to up to 2.27 × 10−3 s-1 and 3.53 × 10−3 s-1, respectively. In the case of alcohol this is also accompanied by the significant (1.4 times) reduction of the induction period to up to 4.9 min. The observed changes are associated with the concentrating of these colloids (∼1.5–1.7 times according to the spectroscopic data) as a result of the gradual alcohol evaporation during the storage under the experimental conditions (glass bulb with a polyethylene lid). This is also confirmed by the study of the catalytic properties of the colloid obtained in ethanol, aged for 50 days, and diluted 1.5 times with the distilled water (for more details, see supplementary materials, Figure S7). The kinetic dependence and the corresponding apparent rate constant for the diluted colloid are close to those observed for the colloid aged for 3 days."
8,The effect of alcohol on catalytic properties of CuOx colloids,"3.3 The effect of alcohol on catalytic properties of CuOx colloids As a rule, the kinetic dependence of the 4-NP reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts and under conditions of the large excess of the reducing agent after the induction period is well described by a pseudo first order rate law [38,55,58–60] (1) w = k a p p C N P In general, the kinetics of the 4-NP reduction with sodium borohydride is well described within the framework of the classical Langmuir-Hinshelwood model [58,59]. This model includes the stages of adsorption of the reducing agent (borohydride ions to yield surface hydrogen species) and 4-NP on the catalyst surface, their interaction from the adsorbed state with the formation of the adsorbed product and its subsequent desorption. All stages of adsorption and desorption are fast and reversible and can be described by the Langmuir isotherm. The surface reaction between the adsorbed reducing agent and 4-NP is the slowest stage that determines the rate of the entire process, and, according to the law of acting surfaces, can be described by the following kinetic equation: (2) w = k θ B H 4 m θ N P n = k ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m ( K N P C N P ) n ( 1 + ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m + ( K N P C N P ) n + ( K P C P ) z ) 2 where θBH4 and θNP are the degree of surface coverage by the respective reactants; k is the rate constant; KBH4, KNP and KP are the adsorption constant of borohydride, 4-NP, and product formed, respectively; CBH4, CNP and CP are the concentrations of borohydride, 4-NP and product formed, respectively. As a rule, the product adsorption is negligible, and the term (KPCP)z is not included into the equation [58,59]: (3) w = k θ B H 4 m θ N P n = k ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m ( K N P C N P ) n ( 1 + ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m + ( K N P C N P ) n ) 2 Under the conditions of the large excess of the reducing agent, small degrees of surface coverage, and low 4-NP concentration, the term (KNPCNP)n in the denominator can be neglected, and the equation becomes pseudo first order Eq. (1), where the apparent rate constant can be expressed as follows: (4) k a p p = k ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m ( K N P ) n ( 1 + ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m ) 2 The induction period is attributed to the time required for the 4-NP adsorption on the catalyst surface before the beginning of the reaction, and is also associated with the substrate-induced restructuring of the surface of the NPs required to render the metal NPs as the active catalyst [59–61]. The results obtained show that the presence of ethanol in the reaction medium has a significant effect on the 4-NP reduction kinetics for primarily reduced CuOx NPs. In general, an increase in the alcohol concentration in the reaction medium leads to an increase in the induction period and a decrease in the apparent reaction rate constant. The deviations from this dependence observed for the samples obtained in water (for aged colloids) and water-ethanol solution with the alcohol concentration of 70 % are due to the additional factors affecting the reaction kinetics, mainly, a decrease in the active catalyst surface in the system due to the formation of the large dense agglomerates of Cu NPs or a decrease in the actual content of the catalyst due to the sedimentation instability of the colloid. In the case of the samples obtained in water, the results observed for freshly prepared colloids are consistent with this assumption. A decrease in the activity of Cu-based catalysts in the 4-NP hydrogenation with sodium borohydride in alcohols and a number of other solvents compared with water was mentioned earlier [38], but the reasons for this effect were not discussed. It is noteworthy that the effect observed for primarily reduced CuOx NPs is not associated with the features of the morphology or phase composition of the particles caused by the conditions (composition of the solution) used to obtain them by the LAL method, but is determined by the state of the surface and the specific surface area of the reduced particles. It is rather difficult to study the surface chemistry of the NPs in colloids (see XPS data in Supplementary material), but we believe that the NPs remain reduced, and only Cu° is present on the surface of the colloids in the excess of NaBH4 used (for details see Supplementary material). This is confirmed by the results of experiments on the effect of alcohol addition to the reaction medium in the case of CuOx catalyst prepared by the LA in water (Figure S8). The addition of 0.0005 mol of ethanol to the reaction medium before or after the CuOx NPs reduction with NaBH4 leads to the decrease in the effective rate constant. The change in the behavior of the kinetic curve at the initial stage upon the ethanol introduction before or after the reduction may be associated with the peculiarities of the establishment of equilibrium at the interface between the catalyst surface and the solution. For clarity, the catalytic activity of the samples prepared by LA in water-ethanol solutions with ethanol concentrations of 10, 20 and 60 % was additionally studied (Figure S9, Table S2). A detailed analysis of the kinetic data obtained for the equal amounts of the catalyst in a series of samples characterized by the formation of Cu NPs similar in morphology and size during the reduction with sodium borohydride (see details in Section 2.2.1) shows that with the increasing of the alcohol concentration in the reaction medium, the specific rate constant does not increase linearly, but only up to the certain limit (Fig. 7 ). This result indicates that the alcohol effect on the kinetics of 4-NP reduction may be due to the alcohol adsorption on the catalyst surface. The adsorption efficiency of the samples during the catalytic experiments should be the same independently on the state of their surface in the initial colloid (before the reduction). The limit observed for high ethanol concentrations is due to the reaching of the sorption capacity under the experimental conditions with respect to the alcohol adsorption. The limit for low ethanol concentrations is because the ethanol adsorbed does not prevent the surface reaction between the adsorbed reducing agent and 4-NP. Thus, the alcohol presenting in the reaction medium imposes an inhibitory effect by sorbing on the same sites of the catalyst surface as the reagents (in particular, 4-NP). Taking into account the competitive sorption of ethanol, the kinetic equation in this case should be represented as follows: (5) w = k θ B H 4 m θ N P n = k ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m ( K N P C N P ) n ( 1 + ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m + ( K N P C N P ) n + ( K E t O H C E t O H ) q ) 2 where KEtOH and CBH4 are the adsorption constant and concentrations of ethanol, respectively. Under conditions corresponding to the pseudo first order of the reaction with respect to 4-NP, the apparent rate constant can be expressed as follows: (6) k a p p = k ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m ( 1 + ( K B H 4 C B H 4 ) m + ( K E t O H C E t O H ) q ) 2 Thus, it will nonlinearly decrease with the increasing of the alcohol concentration. The alcohol effect on the induction period is apparently caused by its sorption on the catalyst surface that prevents the establishment of the adsorption-desorption equilibrium in the system with respect to 4-NP, which is required both for substrate-induced restructuring of the surface of the NPs required to render the metal NPs as an active catalyst and for the direct catalytic conversion [52,55,56]."
9,Conclusions,"In the presented work, a facile and effective method of pulsed laser ablation in liquid was used to obtain the stable colloids of CuOx NPs demonstrating high catalytic activity in the 4-NP hydrogenation reaction. The effect of the use of mixed aqueous ethanol solutions as the LAL medium on the composition, structure, and morphology of CuOx NPs in the resulting colloids as well as the stability of the colloids were studied. The composition of the used water-ethanol solution in the studied range of alcohol concentration from 30 % to 70 % was shown to affect the size of the resulting particles and the sedimentation stability of the obtained colloids, but does not significantly affect the phase composition of the particles obtained during the LAL, and changing of their phase composition and morphology during the colloid aging. For such colloids, similar to the one in distilled water, the predominant formation of the Cu2O phase during the LA in water-ethanol mixtures is characteristic due to the presence of water vapor in the cavitation bubble during the formation of the primary CuOx NPs in the LAL of Cu target. At the same time, in contrast to the colloid of the CuOx NPs obtained in distilled water, the colloids in the water-ethanol medium and in ethanol are characterized by high resistance to deep oxidation of the particles and the formation of large secondary particles during the aging caused by the sorption of ethanol molecules on the particle surface. The sedimentation stability of the colloids in aqueous ethanol solutions is determined by the structure of the solvation shells of the particles and double electric layers in the mixed solvent. The use of water-ethanol solutions with an alcohol concentration below 70 % increases the sedimentation stability of the resulting colloids regardless of the size of particles formed during the LAL. The results of the catalytic studies of CuOx NPs in colloids obtained by LAL indicated their high activity in the 4-nitrophenol reduction comparable to or higher than the one of CuOx catalysts obtained by other methods as well as other investigated catalysts based on oxides and noble metals. The presence of ethanol in the reaction medium has a significant effect on the kinetics of 4-nitrophenol reduction, with the results obtained contributing to the understanding of the lower catalytic activity of the studied CuOx catalyst in ethanol and other nonaqueous solvents. This effect is well described within the framework of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model and indicates that the alcohol present in the reaction medium shows an inhibitory effect on the process of substrate reduction due to the alcohol sorption on the same sites of the catalyst surface along with the reagents."
