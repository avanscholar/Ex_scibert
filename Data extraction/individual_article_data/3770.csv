0,Introduction,"Combinations of two or more functional phases are one of the most promising approaches to develop novel materials and to improve their functions. These synergy effects are indispensable to enhancing the properties of catalysts. It is known that the immobilization of nanosized noble metal on TiO2 enhances its photocatalytic activities. Bowker et al. reported the preparation of Au [1] and Pd [2] nanoparticle-supported TiO2 photocatalysts by the conventional impregnation method. Generally, the impregnation method consists of several steps, i.e., removal of solvents, drying, calcinations and reduction of metal ions by hydrogen. Some post treatments including high temperature induce sintering of supported metals, so that it is difficult to disperse fine particles on the surface of the support in the conventional impregnation method. On the other hand, some of the authors reported the preparations of nanomaterials by the sonochemical reduction method [3–7]. In this method, in situ formation of reducing species via acoustic cavitation, and effective stirring due to shock waves enables one to prepare nanoparticles [8]. This sonochemical method possesses merits for the catalyst preparation because it does not require post treatment and enables us to immobilize metal nanoparticles on supports via a single step from the corresponding metal ions. We also reported sonochemical immobilizations of metal nanoparticles onto the surface of supports, e.g., Pd on Al2O3 [9] and Au on γ-Fe2O3 [10,11] composite nanoparticles. The objective of this paper is to describe syntheses of noble metal nanoparticles TiO2 composite photocatalysts by the sonochemical reduction method. Since Honda and Fujishima found the decomposition of water on the surface of TiO2 electrode [12], photocatalysts have been applied to various fields such as environmental protection, sanitary and so on. Researches on the energy conversion by photocatalysts are also done actively [13]. The effective use of solar energy is important for the achievement of sustainable society. Among various approaches, the photocatalytic reformings of alcohols are noticeable for H2 production. For the practical use of fuel cells, a stable supply of hydrogen is important. In the uses of H2, hazardous substances inducing environmental pollutions are not released. Presently, however, feedstocks for H2 production are fossil fuels, such as natural gas, petroleum and coal [14]. Alcohols can be synthesized from biomass, e.g., fermentations or hydrolyses of celluloses, and this is not so in the case of other fossil fuels. The overall reaction mechanism for the production of H2 from aqueous ethanol can be summarized as two competing reactions as follows [15]: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → (photocatalyst) → 2 H 2 + CH 4 + CO 2 (2) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → (photocatalyst) → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 In the present study, we present the novel synthesis of noble metal (Au, Pd, Pt) nanoparticle-supported TiO2 photocatalysts with the assistance of high power ultrasound. Their photocatalytic activities were also evaluated for hydrogen production from ethanol aqueous solutions at room temperature."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6 ·6H2O), tetrachloroauric acid tetrahydrate (HAuCl4 ·4H2O), sodium tetrachloropalladate trihydrate (PdCl2 ·2NaCl·3H2O), tin(II) chloride dihydrate and ethanol were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. Polyethyleneglycol monostearate (PEG-MS, HO (CH2CH2O)40OCC17H35) and TiO2 powder (P-25) were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo and Degussa, respectively. All reagents were used without further purification. Ultrapure water was used in all experiments. Ar (99% purity) was purchased from Japan Air Gases."
3,Preparation of noble metal nanoparticles supported TiO2 photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of noble metal nanoparticles supported TiO2 photocatalysts A typical procedure is shown below. An aqueous solution containing 1.0mM of H2PtCl6 ·6H2O and 0.4mM of PEG-MS was prepared. It was then followed by 30min of Ar purge and sonication. The sonication times were 60min for Pt, and 15min for Au and Pd in consideration of the reduction rates of corresponding noble metal ions [4,5,16]. A multiwave ultrasonic generator (Kaijo type 4021) and a PZT oscillator of a 65mm diameter were used for the sonication and were operated at 200kHz with an input power of 200W (6W/cm2). After sonication, TiO2 powder was added to the sample solution and prolonged sonication was carried out for 5–60min under an air atmosphere. The apparatus for sonication is shown in our previous paper [3]. The grayish powder thus formed was separated from the sample solution by filtration, washed with water and dried in the constant temperature-oven (50°) for 12h. The catalysts prepared in this manner were referred as Pt/TiO2. The amounts of Pt supported on the surface of TiO2 were determined by colorimetric method using tin(II) chloride [17]. Reduced Pt was dissolved by aqua regia prior to determination. Pd nanoparticles supported TiO2 (Pd/TiO2) and Au nanoparticle-supported TiO2 (Au/TiO2) were also synthesized by similar procedures. PdCl2 ·2NaCl·3H2O and HAuCl4 ·4H2O were used as Pd and Au sources, respectively. The absorption spectra were measured by a spectrophotometer (Simadzu UV-2100). Loaded Pd [16] and Au [5] were also determined by an improved colorimetric method. The nanostructures of obtained photocatalysts were observed by a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010-UHR) operated at 200kV. The specimens for TEM observation were prepared by dropping the sample dispersion onto the collodion-film-covered copper grid."
4,Evaluation of photocatalytic activities for the production of H2,2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activities for the production of H2 Photocatalytic activities of the obtained catalysts were evaluated in the dark room. Noble metal nanoparticles-supported TiO2 (15mg) were mixed with pure water in the reaction vessel. The vessel consists of quartz with two septums for purging and sampling gases. The photocatalysts were dispersed by putting the vessel in an ultrasonic cleaning bath for 30min. Ethanol was added to the sample dispersion and 5M of ethanol aqueous solution (total volume: 30mL) was obtained [18]. The sample was purged with Ar gas bubbling for 30min in order to remove dissolved gases. The reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and light from an Xe lamp (radiation intensity: 56.93W/cm2). Light was irradiated at the room temperature. Samples of 0.1mL were taken periodically (every 1h) from the gas phase. The samples were analyzed for hydrogen contents using a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and active carbon packed column.
5,Results and discussion,"When a reaction mixture containing H2PtCl6 and PEG-MS was sonicated, the color of the solution was turned from pale yellow into dark brown. The change in color shows the formation of Pt nanoparticles via the reduction of Pt(IV) ions. The TEM image and the corresponding size distribution of formed Pt nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1 . Mixing with TiO2 powder, prolonged sonication was carried out. With the progress of the sonication, white TiO2 powder became a homogeneously grayish color. The obtained colored powder was repeatedly washed with pure water, but the gray color did not fade. Fig. 2 shows the TEM image of the products. It was found that smaller Pt nanoparticles with their average diameter of 2.1nm were immobilized on the surface of larger TiO2 particles. The size distribution of supported Pt particles is also displayed in Fig. 2. Both in Figs. 1 and 2, size distributions are found to be very similar. This fact clearly shows that sonochemically formed Pt nanoparticles are immobilized on TiO2 without any aggregation. Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method is also displayed in the figure. The average diameters of the supported Pt nanoparticles are almost the same in both the methods, but the Pt size distribution of the conventional ones is slightly wider. The number of supported Pt nanoparticles by the conventional method is much smaller than by the sonochemical method. In addition, the surface of TiO2 looks smoother than that of the sonochemical products. The roughness of the sonicated surface is probably due to the effect of the ultrasound. Some of the authors already reported the preparation of Pt nanoparticles by the sonochemical reduction of Pt(IV) ions [4]. It was reported that the sonochemical reduction of Pt(IV) ions proceeded stepwise via divalent ionic species. The reduction rates in the primary step, where Pt(IV) ions are reduced to Pt(II) ions, significantly depended on the concentration of PEG-MS and reached a maximum rate at 0.4mM of concentration. On the other hand, the secondary step where Pt(II) ions turned into Pt(0) was independent of the concentration of PEG-MS, except for very a low concentration. The difference in the reduction rates in the two process is reported to stem from different kinds of reducing species participating in the respective reductions of Pt(IV) and Pt(II) ions. We have reported previously that three kinds of reducing species are generated in the cavitational event that occurred in the aqueous solution containing organic compounds such as PEG-MS [4]. 1. Hydrogen atoms generated from the sonolysis of water molecules, 2. Rpy: radicals formed from the direct thermal decomposition of surfactants in the vicinity of the collapsing cavities, and 3. Rab: secondary radicals formed via reactions of the surfactants with primary radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms originated from the sonolysis of water molecules. In comparison with the comparative experiments using gamma radiolysis, we concluded that both Rab and Rpy contribute to the primary reduction step, and that mainly Rabs reduce Pt(II) ions. It has been reported that the solutes are thermally decomposed to form various kinds of products in the sonolysis of aqueous solutions containing organic solutes [19]. Among them, C including compounds, CO and CH4 are suitable indicators of the degree of the sonolysis of the organic solutes. We also reported the correlation between the sonochemical reduction rates of Pt ions and the sonochemical decomposition rates of surfactants [4]. This correlation clearly shows the contribution of the sonochemically formed reducing species toward the sonochemical reduction of Pt ions. The immobilization of the formed Pt nanoparticles is thought to come from the shock wave generated during the collapse of cavitation bubbles. Suslick and Doktycz reported that the shock waves induce the interparticles collisions with a high velocity [20]. The amount of loaded Pt depends upon the prolonged sonication time. The amount increased with the longer prolonged sonication and reached a maximum load at 30min of sonication. These results suggest that sonochemical Pt loading can be controlled by the prolonged sonication time. In the cases of Au/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2, photocatalysts were also successfully prepared by the similar protocols. The TEM images and size distributions of supported noble metal nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 3 . It was reported that the sonochemical reductions of Au(III) ions [5] and Pd(II) ions [21] were induced by the sonochemically formed reducing species, mainly Rpys. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of H2 formation rates upon the Pt loading in hydrogen production from ethanol aqueous solutions. The figure also includes the results of the Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation method. In the case of TiO2 only, the H2 formation rate was very low. This is due to the ready recombination between electrons and holes formed by light. Pt loaded catalysts by ultrasound showed higher activities than those by impregnation. This might come from the effects of sonication which could clean the surface of TiO2 and improve the dispersity of Pt/TiO2. H2 formation was not observed in the control experiment without light irradiation. This fact indicates that the generation of H2 results from the photocatalytic activities of TiO2, not from loaded Pt nanoparticles. We also conducted photocatalytic decomposition of pure water over sonochemically prepared Pt/TiO2 and confirmed that no H2 generation was observed. Therefore, the possibilities that H2 derived from water molecules or residual PEG-MS can be excluded. The photocatalytic activities of Pt/TiO2, Pd/TiO2, Au/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5 . Noble metal loadings were adjusted to 1% w/w in all cases. As can be seen in the figure, Pt/TiO2 catalysts have a higher activity than do others. When noble metals contact with n-type semiconductor TiO2, the excited electrons of TiO2 move into noble metals. These systems cause Schotkky diode behaviors in noble metal contacts on TiO2 [22]. Under these conditions, Pt nanoparticles shows more effective electron-acceptor properties because of the larger work function of Pt (Pt; 5.65eV, Pd; 5.12eV, 5.10eV) [23]. As a result of this, Pt nanoparticles can effectively restrict the recombination of electrons and holes and Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts show a highest activity. Pd/TiO2 shows higher activities than Au/TiO2 although Pd and Au have almost the same work function. This disparity can be interrupted from the sizes of supported nanoparticles. From TEM observations, the average diameters of supported Pd and Au nanoparticles were 3.6 and 14.3nm, respectively. Due to their smaller diameters, the number of supported Pd nanoparticles is larger than that of Au at the same loading. In other words, the wider surface area of TiO2 is covered by Pd nanoparticles than by Au nanoparticles. It is feared that the properties of photocatalysts are spoilt due to the shadowing effect when a lot of nanoparticles are supported on TiO2. On the other hand, if smaller particles are loaded, they can effectively be in contact with TiO2 so that more electrons are trapped and the catalytic activity is enhanced. By these contradicting effects, it is observed that Pd/TiO2 has a higher activity than Au/TiO2. In conclusion, the sonochemical method enables us to prepare noble metal nanoparticle-supported TiO2 photocatalysts. Their activities depend upon the sizes of supported nanoparticles and the work functions of the supported noble metal."
