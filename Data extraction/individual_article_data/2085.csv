0,Introduction,"Research into the utilization of biomass as a sustainable resource for fuels and chemicals now has global breadth and can be described as essential for environmental protection, particularly in the amelioration of damage caused by the use of fossil carbon. The pursuit of bio-based chemicals is also inspired, in part, by the increased revenue that will be directed toward the agricultural sector by the successful adoption of the sustainable biomass-based economy. It can be envisioned that agricultural residues and dedicated crops will be delivered to a biorefinery that will be flexible in its ability to handle biomass and its ability to turn out an assortment of products. This flexibility would allow for the production of both fuel ethanol, which is vulnerable to commodity pricing and low profit margins, and specialty chemicals that would command higher prices and serve to level the cash flow of the biorefinery. One path a refiner could take would be to hydrolyze the pentose sugars from hemicellulose and dehydrate these to furfural. The United States Department of Energy has selected furfural as one of the top 30 biobased building blocks with existing markets for several furan derivatives [1]. One of these derivatives is furfuryl alcohol which is widely used in the manufacture of synthetic polymers [2], and thermoset resins [3], in the stabilization of wood [4], as a component in gel casting of ceramics [5], and as an intermediate in the synthesis of fine chemicals [6]. Furfuryl alcohol is produced industrially over copper chromite catalysts in either stirred or flow reactors [7]. These catalysts exploit copper’s hydrogenation selectivity toward the carbonyl group. Although conversion of furfural is high and furfuryl alcohol selectivity very high with these catalysts, they suffer from loss of activity due to sintering of copper and coke deposition [8]. The search for nontoxic supports to replace chromium also motivates some researchers. This has led to reports of copper supported on CeO2 [9], MgO [10], ZnO [11], NiFeO4-SiO2 [12], Hisil SiO2 [13], mesoporous SBA-15 silica [6], and activated C [14]. Copper has also been used in bimetallic catalysts such as Pd-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst [15] and Cu-Co/MOF [16]. Other active metals on various supports have also been reported including Ni-Mg-O and Ni-Co-O [17], Fe/Ni-B [18], PdRe/Al2O3 [19], and Ni-hydrotalcite [20]. The reaction network for the hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) is shown in Fig. 1 . Once furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is formed, its continued chemistry leads to the collection of possible side products from nonselective catalysis. Ring hydrogenation of FOL leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL) which can ring-open to 1,2- or 1,5-pentanediol depending on which of the ether CO bonds breaks under the hydrogenolysis conditions [21,22]. FOL can also undergo hydrogenolysis of the CO bond (hydrodeoxygenation) yielding 2-methylfuran (2-MF) especially at temperatures above 200°C [13,14,23]. 2-MF can then be further hydrogenated at the double bonds to give 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. As in the case of THFOL, ring-opening leads to 1- and 2-pentanol. Decarbonylation of FOL can also occur, leading to furan and tetrahydrofuran. FOL can also dimerize through an etherification reaction to give difurfuryl ether. Investigations into the mechanism of the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl group indicate that ring orientation on the metal surface plays a key role [13]. Metals such as Pt and Ni strongly adsorb furfural in a flat orientation exposing both the carbonyl group and the carbon–carbon double bonds to hydrogenation, and thus, low selectivity [24]. The addition of oxophilic metals such as Sn or Ti to the catalyst serves to orient unsaturated aldehydes to adsorb at the carbonyl group only, sparing the carbon–carbon double bonds from hydrogenation [25]. Likewise, Cu has a very weak affinity for the double bond and will bind furfural in the η1 (O-aldehyde) orientation exposing this bond to activated hydrogen and leading to high selectivity to furfuryl alcohol from this metal [13]. A strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been shown to increase the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation over Pt/TiO2 [26]. For this catalyst, the interaction between the metal and support served to enhance hydrogen spillover. This in turn, led to hydrogenation of a furfuryl-oxy intermediate that was bound to the support at oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies are the key trait of CuOCeO2 catalysts, and these O vacancies are most often cited as the active site. The CuOCeO2 mixed oxide catalysts are known to catalyze several reactions including the water gas shift reaction [27], oxidation of CO in the presence of H2 [28], methanol synthesis from CO2 [29], selective chemical reduction of NO by CO [30,31], N2O decomposition [32], and the conversion of amines to imines [33]. Despite the apparent broad range of activity, each of these conversions takes advantage of the unique interaction between copper and cerium at the catalytic center. The synergism displayed by the combination of the two metals in the crystal lattice produces a center with broad redox state flexibility between Ce3+/Ce4+ and the Cu+/Cu2+ oxidation states resulting in oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice. While attempting to prepare catalysts for the upgrading of pyrolysis oil, we happened onto the selective hydrogenation of furfural by the CuOCeO2 mixed oxide. Furfural is a large component of the aqueous portion of pyrolysis oil, along with acetic acid and several other small oxygenated compounds. It is also a strong catalyst poison through coke formation. One upgrading route aimed at the small acids in pyrolysis oil is the ketonization of the acids, for example, the coupling of two acetic acid molecules to form acetone [34,35]. We designed our catalysts to have ceria centers for the ketonization reaction and copper centers for the hydrogenation of furfural. However, the high temperature requirement of the former reaction made furfural an even more potent coke former. When the reaction was run at lower temperatures, no acetone was formed, since the ketonization manifold was not available, but the furfural was reduced to furfuryl alcohol owing to the facility of the Cu sites for this reaction. We proceeded to refine the catalyst so as to improve the hydrogenation reaction. The results of these efforts are reported here."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·xH2O, furfuryl alcohol, and basic alumina were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Cu2Cr2O5 (Cu 1950P) was from BASF. Furfural was from Alfa-Aesar (Ward Hill, MA) and stored cold to limit polymerization."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The CuOCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared in a sequential loading of Ce and Cu onto the alumina support. Wet impregnations were performed by stirring nitrate salt solutions into the alumina support until a thick paste formed. Cerium loadings of 20wt% Ce on Al2O3 were achieved in a single wet impregnation step; heavier loadings were done using successive steps. The resulting powder was air dried then calcined in air at 500°C for 2h giving a uniformly yellow powder. Copper was then loaded by wet impregnation using aqueous solutions of Cu(NO3)2·xH2O in the same manner to a nominal 20wt% Cu and the resulting powder was calcined at 800°C for 2h. This powder was then stripped of excess CuO by stirring in concentrated HNO3 for about 1h at room temperature. The final catalysts were collected by filtration and washed with water and methanol before being dried under vacuum. The resulting powders were 10–100μm in diameter. Catalysts are designated at CuOXCeO2/Al2O3, where X is the nominal loading of Ce onto the alumina support. 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 was prepared by wet impregnation of Cu(NO3)2 onto basic alumina and calcined at 500°C for 2h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Surface textures were determined using a Quantachrome ASiQ (Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL, USA) gas sorption analyzer. Samples were outgassed at 210°C for 10h prior to analysis. Analyses were performed at 77K using N2 as the adsorptive. Surface areas were determined using the BET equation within range 0.05<P/Po <0.30. Pore sizes were determined using the BJH method on the adsorption branch of the isotherms. Temperature programmed reductions (H2-TPR) were performed using 10% H2 in Ar. Nitrous oxide pulse titrations were used to measure Cu00 surface areas. Reduction of N2O was determined by following its loss and concomitant N2 formation using a Pfeiffer Prisma Plus residual gas analyzer attached to the ASiQ analyzer. Catalysts were outgassed at 90°C under vacuum then under flowing He. The samples were then heated to 325°C under 10% H2 in Ar for 30min. The gas flow was then switched back to He and the sample held at 90°C for the Cu titration. A copper surface-atom density of 1.46×1019 m−2 was used for the surface area calculation which gives 0.271mlN2Om−2 Cu00 assuming complete surface coverage by oxygen [36]. Ammonia-TPD measurements were performed as follows: Approximately 150mg sample was pretreated to remove volatile contaminants. The sample was then cooled to ambient temperature and treated with pure NH3. The NH3 was removed under vacuum and then the TPD measurement was started. The TPD was recorded from 70°C to 550°C at a ramp of 10°C/min. Experimental details are given in the Supporting Information. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were made on a JOEL JSM-6010LA SEM with an integrated EDS attachment operating at 10 keV. X-ray diffractograms were recorded on a Bruker D2 Phaser (Bruker AXS Inc., Billerica, MA) using θ/θ geometry and Cu Kα radiation generated at a current of 10mA and 30kV. Scans were run over a 2θ range of 10–90° with a step size of 0.02° and a time per step of 0.2s. The sample stage was rotated at 10rpm during the scan. Initial divergence slit size was 0.6mm and a 1mm air scatter screen was used above the sample. A Lynxeye™ detector was used in conjunction with a 2.5° Soller slit and a Ni-Kα filter. XPS measurements were made using a Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Inc., Manchester, UK) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). High-resolution spectra were collected with a pass energy of 40eV from a 0.7mm x 0.3 area using the hybrid (electrostatic and magnetic immersion) lens mode. The powder samples were loaded for analysis onto double-sided copper tape. The binding energy scale was referenced to the adventitious C 1s signal at 285.0eV."
5,Furfural hydrogenations,"2.4 Furfural hydrogenations The reactions were performed in a fixed-bed reactor (Parr Instruments, Moline, IL, USA) operating in a downward flow mode. The reactor tube was 50cm long with a 9.5mm inside diameter. Two grams of undiluted catalyst were loaded into the reactor producing a bed that was 17mm long. The bed was in the center zone such that the controlling/recording thermocouple rested in the top few millimeters of the catalyst bed. The length of the tube was heated with a three-zone split-tube furnace. The bottom section of the tube was filled with a 5mm diameter glass tube that supported the catalyst bed on a pad of glass wool. This section was maintained at 65°C. The top zone was empty and maintained at the same temperature as the catalyst bed. For the reactions run at 175°C, the center heater ran at 162°C with the heat of the reaction supplying the remainder. Furfural was delivered to the catalyst by a syringe pump (Teledyne-Isco, Inc., Lincoln, NE) at 35–46μl/min. H2 flow through the reactor was controlled by a Sierra Instruments mass flow controller to be 150ml/min and pressure of the system was maintained by the back pressure regulator included with the reactor. The furfural entered the H2 stream at a T junction outside of the heated zone and was swept into the reactor. Under these conditions of flow, the substrate stream is in laminar flow and has a Reynolds number of 3, indicating that there is sufficient volume for mixing in the empty upper portion of the reactor and the gas is at equilibrium when it reaches the catalyst bed. Products were collected in a gas/liquid separator."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods GCFID and GCMS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu QP2010 SE GC/mass spectrometer/FID. Separations were accomplished using a Supelco Petrocol DH 50.2 (50m×0.2mm×0.5μm) column. The oven program was as follows: Initial temperature 50°C for 3min, ramp at 20°C/min to 275°C with a final hold time of 2min. Methyl octanoate was used as internal standard. The mass spectrometer was operated in the EI mode at 70eV."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Surface texture The surface features of the CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts are given in Table 1 . The data show that the addition of CeO2 reduces the surface area and pore volume of the alumina support in direct correlation with the amount of CeO2 added (For a detailed discussion of the surface texture and effects of adding ceria to the alumina see the Supporting Information starting with Figs. S1–S4). The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the catalysts also shows the higher Ce loading forms a surface layer that obscures the alumina base (Supporting Information Figs. S5-S7). Column 5 in Table 1 lists the mass ratios of Cu and Al normalized to Ce where it can be seen that the Ce:Al ratio increases with increased Ce loading. Since the EDS analysis penetrates ∼2μm, these results reflect the top-heavy loading of the Ce onto the alumina. For example, the CuO40CeAlOx catalyst was prepared to be nominally 40wt% Ce but the EDS analysis has the Ce loaded as 56.2wt%, indicating the Ce is not evenly distributed in the bulk of the alumina. Likewise, the PXRD results indicate that the CeO2 crystallites on the alumina surface were larger with the higher CeO2 loading (Supporting Information Figs. S8-S10). The crystallites were also subject to sintering as higher calcination temperatures led to size increases from 7.8nm to 13.9nm in the 20wt% CeO2/Al2O3 when this support was calcined at 500°C and 800°C, respectively. The Cu was initially loaded to 20wt% onto 20, 30, and 40wt% Ce/Al2O3 catalyst precursors. Following the nitric acid wash, the Cu loading fell to 3.7, 3.3, and 3.0wt% (by ICP-OES), respectively. The addition of Cu also caused surface area and pore volume to decrease while pore diameters got larger indicating the catalysts have pores that are much shallower than the supporting alumina. The PXRD diffractograms of the catalysts, collected after removal of excess CuO, are that of CeO2 in the fluorite structure, while the CuO structure is absent, indicating that either the CuO is incorporated in the CeO2 lattice as a solid solution or is so well dispersed that it cannot be detected by this method. However, since the catalysts were treated with concentrated HNO3 to effectively remove surface CuO, the latter explanation would seem unlikely. Also, these catalysts are all shades of khaki, the same color as the nanoparticulate copper/ceria catalysts described by Elias et al. [37]. 3.1.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra in the Cu 2p and Ce 3d regions for the CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 in the as-prepared, oxidized form and in the catalytic reduced form. The Cu region shows the presence of CuO in the oxidized catalyst with binding energy peaks at 952eV (Cu 2p1/2) and 932.5eV (Cu 2p3/2) along with strong satellite peaks at 945eV and 965eV. In the reduced form, the satellite peaks are absent indicating the Cu is either Cu2O or Cu0 as neither of these has strong satellite peaks. Accordingly, we appeal to the Auger emission spectra to differentiate the two lower oxidation states of Cu. The emission spectrum in Fig. 3 shows that the Cu LMM Auger line has kinetic energy peaks at 916.7eV and 918.3eV indicating a mixture of Cu2O and Cu0 at the surface. These AES results are in general agreement with the N2O titrations, discussed below, that show the Cu in the reduced catalysts is divided between Cu2O and Cu0, albeit with small surface areas. However, the mix of oxidation states at the surface could be the consequence of two possibilities not related to surface reduction. Although XPS is known to have shallow penetration into the surface layers, it could be reaching a layer of Cu2O just below the Cu0 surface. This would produce the Cu2O peak [34]. Cu0 is also sensitive to air oxidation forming Cu2O. Our first effort to collect the AES data using a sample that was not carefully protected from exposure to air resulted in finding a surface consisting of only Cu2O. In the Ce region, the difference in the XPS spectra of the reduced and oxidized species is limited to a slight change in line shape and resolution change in the 898eV and 901eV binding energy peaks. This difference may be related more to the amount of Cu remaining in the ceria lattice rather than the oxidation state of the Ce [38]. There is no indication of the formation of Ce3+, which may be expected since the catalyst was reduced at 325°C, well below the temperature at which CeO2 is reduced [39,40], and with the Cu migrating to the surface and being readily reduced, as indicated by the data in Table 2 . The results of EDS and XPS analyses of two of the copper-ceria catalysts in the as-prepared, reduced, and used conditions are shown in Table 2. It is apparent from either analysis that the surface of the catalysts is fluid. The deeper penetration of the EDS measurement shows the Cu:Ce ratio changes when the catalysts are on stream, although the ratio increased for the CuO20CeO2/Al2O3 and decreased for the CuO40CeO2/Al2O3. The XPS analyses that better characterize the surface of the catalysts, show that the copper migrates from the mixed oxide to the surface. This occurs both when the catalysts were used in the hydrogenation of furfural and when they were simply pre-reduced under hydrogen at 325°C. However, the migration occurs to a greater extent when the catalyst was used for the hydrogenation likely due to the time on stream of about 25h. The two catalysts both showed that the surface Cu concentration was highest in the used and reduced form. The CuO20CeO2/Al2O3 sample even shows that the surface Cu exceeds the Ce concentration, both when fresh and reduced or used, but especially so when used, as the Cu:Ce ratio reached 1.5 in this sample. This migration likely explains the changes in the temperature programmed hydrogenation profiles, described below, as well. 3.1.2 Temperature programmed reduction Temperature programmed reduction has been reported in the literature as a means to characterize the Cu environment in CuOCeO2 mixed metal oxide catalysts [43–45]. These studies and others revealed the remarkable, high reduction potential of small Cu particles in close contact with ceria as made evident by peaks in the H2-TPR spectrum having temperatures as low as 144°C. The temperature programmed reduction results from the fresh and used CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts alongside the Cu/Al2O3 and Cu2Cr2O5 are shown in Fig. 4 . The used catalysts were recalcined at 500°C under air to remove any coke prior to the H2-TPR measurement. This calcining in air operation was completed to remove coke from redox sites so as to make these sites available, and to preclude the possibility of some hydrogen reacting with the coke and thus, causing hydrogen use beyond that at the redox sites. All three of the fresh catalysts show a sharper reduction peak occurring near 300°C, whereas the used and still active catalysts show broader peaks at temperatures >100°C lower than the fresh catalysts. These peaks are also more complex with the CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 in particular showing several fairly well-defined, temperature maxima. Table 2 summarizes these results for the CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts. In addition, the peak data for 5wt% Cu/Al2O3, is shown (Table 3 ). The data in this table are arranged by giving the peak temperatures in columns under headings defined by Greek letters. These column headings were used to distinguish the Cu environments discussed in the literature [43–45] and we use these same Greek letters to describe the H2-TPR data we recorded here. Consider first the control sample, 5wt% Cu/Al2O3, where the peak temperature, 210°C, is the same as the literature value. This β peak describes a reduction temperature for the environment of bulk CuO crystallites in contact with a non-reducible surface where the Cu content is less than 7.5wt% [45]. Since the overall Cu loading in this sample was <7.5%, we did not see the γ peak. The fresh CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 samples all show peaks above 240°C (γ' peaks) which can be attributed to large CuO crystallites in hard to reduce environments. Each of the used samples showed peak temperatures that can be attributed to the α1, α2, β', & γ' peaks. This change in the Cu morphology and environment is likely due to a migration of Cu to the surface of the ceria that results from the reduction of the CuOCe lattice. The XPS data, mentioned above, confirms the migration of copper to the ceria surface. The fresh CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts show a trend of increased H2 consumption with increased Ce loading despite decreased Cu content, consistent with previous reports [46]. Table 4 shows the H2/Cu ratios of the fresh and used catalysts. The results indicate that there is hydrogen spillover onto the CeO2 support. This effect is greater in the used catalysts in which Cu has migrated to the surface where there would be greater contact with the CeO2. In the used catalysts, all three consumed more H2 than is required for complete reduction of the Cu, thereby creating a hydrogen storage capacity for the furfural reduction [47]. It is not clear what form this stored hydrogen takes, but it does not reduce Ce+4 to Ce+3 as the latter is absent from the XPS spectra. Zimmer, et. al [43] have investigated the H2-TPR behavior of CuO/CeO2 and noted that the H2-TPR behavior of the mixed oxide was not reproducible in reduction-oxidation cycles, unlike that reported for Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 nanoparticles [44]. We observed the same irreversible behavior with the supported CuOCe. When the fresh CuO30CeO2/Al2O3 was treated to a H2-TPR measurement and reoxidized under 5% O2/Ar at 175°C, the second H2-TPR run results in a complex peak occurring around 206°C. When the sample was reoxidized at 500°C, the peak of reduction occurred at 167°C. (See Supporting Information Fig. S12). This, along with the XPS data, indicates that the reduction of the Cu2+, and not necessarily the reaction with furfural, causes the irreversible migration of the Cu. 3.1.3 N2O titrations The titration of the copper centers with nitrous oxide was used to evaluate the copper surface area of the catalysts. As described in the experimental section, N2O reacts with Cu0 producing Cu+. The copper chromite catalyst had a Cu0 surface area of 5.5m2/g which is in line with the results of Deutsch and Shanks [48]. The CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts, with Cu0 surface areas less than 3m2/g, have surface areas lower than either the copper chromite or 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 catalysts. These data reinforce the previously described findings of low Cu dispersion, vide supra. The methods we used to examine the Cu centers, EDS, XPS, H2-TPR, and N2O titrations, create an image of a catalytic center in which the Cu is initially in the ceria lattice and a small portion of this segregates to form the active Cu0 surface. 3.1.4 Surface acidity The surface acidity as measured by NH3-TPD indicates that the loading of CeO2 onto Al2O3 lowers the number and strength of the acid sites. (Supporting Information, Fig. S11.) The addition of CuO to the CeO2 further reduces the acidity, as does reduction of the catalysts. The CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst had only 0.03mmol H+/g compared to the starting Al2O3 that had 0.43mmol H+/g. This change in surface acidity is relevant to the reaction pathways opened or closed for the further reaction of furfuryl alcohol. That is, reactions such as the dehydration of FOL to its ether dimer and the ring-opening reactions are catalyzed by surface acidity. The selective elimination of this surface acidity may be related to the higher selectivity of the CuOCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts. (See Supporting Information for a more thorough discussion of the ammonia TPD data)."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity The hydrogenation of furfural was performed under conditions of high conversion in order to assess the catalysts for practical use. In particular, it is important to compare these catalysts to that used commercially for this reaction. However, the conditions for highest conversion were not the same for the three catalysts we considered in this work. The 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 and CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts gave the highest yields of FOL and had longer productive time on stream at 175°C but copper chromite gave higher yields and lost activity more slowly at 165°C. Each of the catalysts performed better under moderately higher hydrogen pressure. Therefore, the reactions conditions chosen were 175°C and 5bar H2 pressure. Generally, catalytic performance is also influenced by 1) accumulation of coke on the catalytic surfaces, 2) oxidation state(s) for those catalysts experiencing oxidation/reduction during the reaction mechanism, 3) loading of catalytic metal, and catalytic metal particle sizes, and 4) the reducibility of the metal oxide support. Each of these may be a factor in the performance of the CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts. 3.2.1 Effect of H2 pressure on the performance of CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 As we worked to establish optimal mass/flow conditions for the hydrogenation of FAL over CuO20CeO2/Al2O3, it became apparent that increased hydrogen pressure improved catalyst performance, both in terms of FOL yield and productive time on stream, that is, it delayed coke formation. When the reaction was performed under one atmosphere H2 pressure, FOL production was low at 30% yield and a 66% loss of activity resulted after only 170min on stream. Whereas, under 5bar hydrogen pressure, FOL yield was 60% and the catalyst remained active for 5.5h. 3.2.2 Performance of CuOXCeO/Al2O3 compared to benchmark catalysts Fig. 5 shows the product distribution with time from the conversion of FAL over 5wt% Cu/Al2O3, Cu2Cr2O5, and CuO40CeO/Al2O3. From these plots the selectivity, defined as the amount of FOL produced as a fraction of FAL reacted, can be discerned. The high selectivity of Cu2Cr2O5 toward FOL can be seen in Fig. 5A where the only byproduct is 2-methylfuran (2-MF). The yield of FOL, defined as the selectivity toward FOL multiplied by the percent conversion of FAL, is 87%. By comparison, 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 gave a lower yield of FOL at 78% and produced both 2-MF (4.45) and difurfuryl ether (6.1%) as byproducts. This is shown in Fig. 5B. The 2-MF could be the result of hydrogenolysis (i.e., hydrocracking) of FOL. Hydrocracking can occur when hydrogenation and strong acid functions are combined in one catalyst. The difurfuryl ether can be attributed to the separate activity of acid sites for the etherification of FOL and thus responsible for the relatively lower yield of the alcohol [49]. Carbon balances, as defined by the compounds quantified by gas chromatographic analysis, were between 90% and 94% for each catalyst. The missing carbon is mostly coke that was visibly deposited on the catalysts and reactor wall. Coke formation is discussed in detail below. Other compounds detected but not quantified include THFA, 1,2-pentanediol, and ɣ-valerolactone. These were produced only by 5wt% Cu/Al2O3. Fig. 5C shows the time course for the conversion of furfural over CuO40CeO2/Al2O3. This catalyst was initially more selective toward FOL than was copper chromite. However, the FOL does dimerize to form difurfuryl ether at a level that keeps the FOL yield below that reached when copper chromite was used to catalyze the reaction. As mentioned for the 5% Cu/Al2O3, we assume this is the result of the slight acidity on the catalyst. The dehydration of primary alcohols to form ethers is an acid-catalyzed reaction and despite using a basic alumina as support and coating this with ceria, there remains about 0.03mmol H+/g catalyst. To further examine the dimerization reaction, we passed FOL over a bed of CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 at a W/F=60 (gcat/molFOL)h to show that 20 mol% of the FOL underwent dimerization before activity declined. Coke formation occurred when either FAL or FOL were used as feed. Despite the familiar polymerization of FAL leading to coke, this is not the only source. We speculate that coke is also formed from polymerization of olefins formed from the acid-catalyzed, dehydration of FOL. 3.1.4 Effect of space-time upon formation of coke For the FAL hydrogenations, activity loss was delayed somewhat by running the reaction at lower FAL flow rates. Fig. 5D shows the time course over CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 at W/F=80 (gcat/molFAL)h. When the data in Fig. 5C and D are replotted in terms of FAL rate vs mass FAL passed over the catalyst, it can be seen that activity loss is substantially delayed by lower FAL flows, not just in time but also in terms of FAL passed over the catalyst, Fig. 6 . The data at each value of the space-velocity, show the combined effects of selective conversion to FOL and the non-selective formation of coke. If we assume that the data at large-values of gFAL/gcat reflect the formation of coke only, and we know that coke is autocatalytic, then we may estimate the relative formation rates of coke as a function of space-velocity. From the linear portion of each plot, the rate losses were found to be 0.004mmol FAL/(gFAL/gcat) at W/F=80 (gcat/molFAL)h and 0.024mmol FAL/(gFAL/gcat) at W/F=60 (gcat/molFAL)h. Others have reported this relationship between FAL feed rate and coke yields [6]. This result suggests a competition exists between hydrogenation and coke formation. The data of rate versus (gFAL/gcat) may be corrected for coke formation by subtracting the coke formation rates at each space-time from the rate of conversion data in Fig. 6 (solid lines) to produce the coke-free, conversion rate data (dashed lines). These corrected data show transients in rates vs. (gFAL/gcat) as the catalysts “break-in” followed by constant values in the conversion rate at each value of the space-time. We speculate that Cu oxidation state(s) are adjusting during the “break in” period. If reaction kinetics govern the system, one might expect the conversion rates to be defined only by space-velocity and temperature/pressure as was observed here. The activity of deactivated catalysts was recovered after combustion of the coke deposits at 375°C in flowing air and subsequent reduction of the Cu centers. 3.2.4 Copper dispersion, furfural turnover frequency, and H2-TPR kinetics The data from the EDS analyses and N2O titrations can be used to calculate the dispersion (%D) of Cu defined as the number of surface Cu mol/number of bulk Cu mol. These are given in Table 5 . For the three CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts and the 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, the ICP-OES and EDS data for the fresh catalysts were employed to estimate the amount of total Cu in these samples and the N2O titration data were used to estimate the amount of reducible surface Cu in the samples. The CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts showed 0.049-0.064mmol surface Cu/gcat, whereas the two benchmark samples, 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 and Cu2Cr2O5, showed 0.074 and 0.132mmol surface Cu/gcat, respectively The percent Cu dispersion was determined by the ratio of the amount of reduced surface Cu (mmol/gcat) by the amount of total bulk Cu (mmol/gcat). We show values of 10.8%, 11.7%, 10.2% dispersion for the CuOXCeO2 catalysts for X=20, 30, and 40, respectively; whereas, the 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 showed a dispersion of 9.4% and the Cu2Cr2O5 shows a Cu dispersion of 2.1%. These values can be compared to literature values. Patel, et al. [50]. reported the dispersion for CuO/Al2O3 when the samples had been treated at 550, 900 and 1200°C. The corresponding Cu dispersions in these catalysts were 50%, 32% and 8.2% for Cu loadings of 4.5-4.6wt%. These copper loadings were similar to what we used and their alumina showed a surface area of 250m2/g with a pore volume of 0.32cm3/g. For the same pretreatment as our catalyst (500–550°C) we see a much lower value of the dispersion: 9.4% vs. 50%. Lopez, et al.[51] reported a Cu dispersion of 52% for a sample of CuO/Al2O3 (4.6wt% Cu) which is much higher than what we report here. On the other hand, we reported a Cu dispersion for the copper chromite that was similar to one literature value, 1.22%, which was reported for Cu2Cr2O5: CuCrO4/CuO/Cu/BaCrO4/Al2O3 (45:1:13:11:30% b.w.), obtained from BASF Cu-1234-1/16-3F [52]. One way to compare catalyst reactivity data is to convert the absolute reaction rates (mol converted/time) into turnover frequency (TOF=mol substrate converted/number of active sites-time). Data of average reaction rate [FAL conversion times space velocity, (g FAL fed/min-g cat)] were changed to mmol FAL converted/min-gcat. The ratio of FAL conversion rate to the mmol surface Cu/gcat gives the turnover frequency (TOF), mmol FAL converted/(mmol surface Cu-min). These numbers should be compared with some caution as they were necessarily collected under conditions of high conversion due to rapid coke formation at low furfural conversion. As a result, these reactions may not have been free from transport limitations. Despite this, it is suitable to examine TOFs as a means of comparing the new and commercial catalysts after adjustments were made for Cu-dispersion and Cu-loadings. We have made the assumptions for this calculation that Cu0 is the active site for the hydrogenation and the Cu0 surface area is proportional to the number of active sites. Therefore, we define the TOF=mol substrate converted/mol surface Cu0-min. This TOF can be interpreted to be the average rate that a catalytic site is used and this information is useful in designing catalysts with the fastest intrinsic kinetics, free from transport limitations. Using the TOF data in Table 3 to rank the data, we observe that the CuO40CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst shows the highest TOF at 3.47min−1; whereas, the two common catalysts, 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 and Cu2Cr2O5, show lower values of the TOF: 2.40 and 1.34min−1, respectively. It is helpful to explain these differences in TOFs between the catalysts in terms of physical characterizations. By converting the reaction rates to TOFs, we have a direct measure of the intrinsic activities of the catalysts. From an inspection of catalyst characterizations, we find the H2-TPR data show significant differences in the reduction kinetics as revealed by the peak temperatures. In Table 2 we can see the effect the CeO2 loading has on the reduction kinetics of the Cu centers. The used CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 samples each show reductions occurring below 200°C (α1 & α2 peaks). These reduction kinetics are relevant to the reaction kinetics because the Cu surface must be regenerated between reaction events; that is, the Cu oxidation state(s) must be maintained at, or adjusted to, the needed state and the Cu sites must be freely accessible to the substrate. These low temperature peaks are characteristic of facile reduction kinetics that can be accessed when the reaction temperature is 175°C, as it was in our reactions. 5wt% Cu/Al2O3 shows only one peak at 210°C that was assigned to a β peak and only a portion of this peak is inside the 175°C reaction temperature, thus, only a fraction of the Cu sites have the proper reduction kinetics to accommodate the reaction. The higher temperature peaks suggest slower reduction kinetics than the catalysts demonstrating lower temperature reduction peaks. To explain the FAL hydrogenation kinetics over the CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts, we can examine the reduction parameters from the H2-TPR experiments shown in Fig. 4. With increased CeO2 loading in the catalysts, the rate of reduction increases and the “average” temperature of the reduction decreases. These results have been observed by others in CuO/CeO2 catalysts [32]. To interpret these kinetics results, we look to “static” data of hydrogen use in these samples as a function of ceria loading. Examination of the H2-TPR traces reveals that the percentage of the total hydrogen consumed during the H2-TPR that is under the α1 and α2 sites increases from 7 to almost 10% upon increasing the CeO2 content from 20 to 40wt%. These data in Fig. 2 demonstrate the phenomenon of interfacial reactivity, i.e., the unique activity which gives rise at the metal–support interface [53]. As the loading of ceria increases from 20 to 40wt%, the hydrogen consumption increases at the α1 and α2 Cu sites. The practical implication of these results is the role of CeO2 in these catalysts is to lower the reaction temperature to 170°C and to facilitate this selective reduction at this temperature by increasing the amount hydrogen furnished at this lower temperature."
10,Conclusions,"The CuOCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts described herein can be viewed as a solid solution of CuO in the CeO2 lattice supported on alumina. Reduction of the catalysts causes the Cu to migrate to the surface of the CeO2 lattice forming the active surface of Cu0. The catalysts prepared using different loadings of CeO2 onto Al2O3 were selective for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Under moderately high hydrogen pressure of 5bar, selectivity and time on stream are improved over the performance of 5wt% Cu/Al2O3, although coke formation does cause activity to fall after a few hours. Catalyst poisoning by coke is delayed when the hydrogenation is performed at higher values of W/F. The main byproduct that reduces furfuryl alcohol yield is difurfuryl ether, likely due to acid sites on the catalysts causing dehydration of the alcohol. Examination of the TOF data shows that the CuOXCeO2/Al2O3 catalysts have moderately higher values of the intrinsic reactivity than the two control catalysts: Cu/Al2O3 and copper chromite. We observed an inverse relationship between the temperature of the H2-TPR peak and the TOFs of the furfural hydrogenation catalysts. These data are consistent with the redox nature of Cu and CeO2."
