0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been considered as a potential clean and environmental friendly energy carrier for a sustainable growth of an increasingly energy dependent society. However, currently, hydrogen is mostly produced from fossil fuels (96%), which clearly are not sustainable and CO2 neutral routes. Among them, steam reforming (SR) of natural gas represents the most employed process (48%). It is crucial to develop new technologies to produce hydrogen from renewable sources, such as biomass, at high energy efficiency, in an environmental friendly and cost attractive manner. Crude glycerol (CGLY), a by-product of biodiesel production (10–12 wt% of the total product) [1] has been increasingly produced in recent years as a consequence of the rapid growth in biodiesel production. Increasing availability and renewability of glycerol make it attractive to utilize glycerol as feedstock, e.g., for H2 production [2–5]. To convert crude glycerol to hydrogen, different routes such as pyrolysis [6], gasification [7–9], aqueous phase reforming [10,11] and catalytic steam reforming [12–17] have been investigated in recent years. The integration of the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction and the CO2 removal to the steam reforming (SR) reaction in a single reactor by incorporating a CaO-based sorbent in the catalyst bed has been shown as a promising approach to enhance the efficiency in the hydrogen production from biomass-derived products, such as pure [18] and crude glycerol [19]. We have previously reported that the hydrogen production with both purity and yield of approximately 99% was achieved by sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of pure glycerol, at atmospheric pressure, 575 °C and steam/C ratio of 3 [18]. Dou et al. have recently illustrated that integration of SR of crude glycerol with in-situ CO2 removal can produce hydrogen at about 90 vol% purity, with methane and CO in balance [19]. However, purification processes such as steam reforming of hydrocarbons, WGS reaction and CO2 separation are still required for production of pure hydrogen, which limits its advantages and applications. Direct production of pure hydrogen is highly desired to simplify the processes, thus reduces the cost of hydrogen production. However, it is still a great challenge to produce almost pure hydrogen directly from crude glycerol due to its composition complexity. In addition, the H2 yield from the SESR of crude glycerol has not been addressed so far. Dou et al. have presented another challenge in the conversion of crude glycerol, namely the very high coking potential due to presence of heavy compounds such as C17–C19 acid methyl esters [19]. The carbon or coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation and low hydrogen yield, since the hydrogen yield is very sensitive to coke formation. From the ultimate analysis of crude glycerol (see Experimental part) the stoichiometry of the SESR reaction, after combining SR, WGS and carbonation reactions, would perform according to the following exothermic reaction: (1) C 3 H 8.95 O 3.4 + 2.6 H 2 O + 3 CaO → 7.08 H 2 + 3 CaC O 3 Δ H r 0 = − 591 kJ k g CGLY − 1 Thus, the stoichiometric hydrogen yield, which represents the theoretical maximum by the combined SR and WGS reactions of the CGLY, would be 7.08 mol of hydrogen per mol of CGLY (or 143.5 g H2 kgCGLY −1). We treated the crude glycerol mixture as a lumped compound, and the stoichiometric hydrogen yield was obtained by the C, H and O mass balances based on the C, H and O stoichiometric number of the mixture, thus regardless of the detailed composition of the crude glycerol mixture. The alternative reaction pathway to hydrogen from CGLY is the catalytic/thermal decomposition, which leads to only 4.47 mol of hydrogen per mol of CGLY. In addition, the pyrolysis of the crude glycerol mixture could form hydrocarbons (C n H m ), mainly CH4, in the product gas, and solid coke [20], which lower the hydrogen yield and should be suppressed. Catalysts with high activity and selectivity are then crucial for obtaining high yield of hydrogen from SESR processes [4]. For the selective hydrogen production from C2–C6 oxygenated compounds, the formation of H2 and CO through the C–C and C–H bonds cleavage, followed by the WGS reaction is the preferred pathway [21]. Hydrotalcite derived Co–Ni catalysts have been developed in our laboratory, which has been shown high C–C bond cleavage activity in SESR of different oxygenated compounds such as ethanol [22,23], and pure glycerol [18] as well as biosyngas [24]. In this work we extend the single-stage SESR reaction to a much more complex and more realistic feedstock of crude glycerol, obtained directly from an industrial biodiesel plant as a by-product, in a fixed-bed reactor containing a mixture of Ni–Co catalyst derived from hydrotalcite-like material (HT) and calcined dolomite as CO2 sorbent. The effects of operating parameters such as, temperature and spatial time, as well as the catalyst–sorbent cyclic stability, were experimentally evaluated, aiming at optimizing conditions toward higher hydrogen purity and yield. The SESR reaction integrated steam reforming of oxygenates and hydrocarbons, water gas shift reactions and carbonation reactions into one stage. The limiting reaction step to the high hydrogen yield is identified by a reaction pathway analysis based on the changes in hydrogen yield and selectivity with spatial time of CGLY in the reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Crude glycerol (CGLY),"2.1 Crude glycerol (CGLY) The crude glycerol (CGLY) used in the present work mainly consists of 70–90 wt% glycerol, with water and methanol contents lower than 15 wt%, inorganic salts lower than 5 wt% and polyglycerol impurities up to 5 wt%, based on the data sheet from Directive 2001/58/EC provided by the manufacturer [19]. The water and methanol in the crude glycerol favors the production of hydrogen, so its removal step, which is often used for upgrading crude glycerol value, is avoided by using the reforming or our sorption enhanced reforming process. The content of C, H, N, S and O in the CGLY consisted of 36.2, 9.1, 0.1, 0.0 and 54.6 wt%, respectively [19]. From this analysis, the calculated average elemental molar formula, based on C, H and O, was therefore C3±0.2H8.9±0.4O3.4±0.2. The liquid density of the CGLY was measured as 1386 kg m−3 at 20 °C compared to 1261 kg m−3 for pure glycerol [19]. In addition, the lower heating value (LHV) of the CGLY was 17.64 MJ kg−1, slightly higher than that of the pure glycerol, 16.01 MJ kg−1 [19]. The composition of the crude glycerol usually varies and depends on the crop or animal oils used as feedstock in the biodiesel synthesis. The higher density and heating value of the CGLY could be due to the presence of the following components in the sample: linoleic (C19H34O2), palmitic (C17H34O2), oleic (C19H36O2), and stearic (C19H38O2) acid methyl esters, revealed by a GC–MS spectrum of the CGLY [19]. The complexity of crude glycerol steam reforming is reflected by the many possible products that can be obtained: hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, methanol, acrolein, ethanol, allyl alcohol, formaldehyde, water and coke [7,25]. The solid residue of biomass was measured by a temperature programmed oxidation in air (50 Nml min−1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 815 °C in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, Netzsch–STA 449). A small amount of CGLY (20 mg) was placed in an alumina crucible and oxidized. A solid residue of 3.5 wt% was obtained, which is possibly the inorganic salts content of the crude glycerol (CGLY)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The hydrotalcite-like material (HT) used as catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation of Co(NO3)3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Mg(NO3)3·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O. The stoichiometric ratio of cations was chosen to yield 40% total metal loading of Co and Ni, giving a material with the nominal composition 20%Ni–20%Co HT. The obtained precipitate was then filtered, dried and calcined to yield Co–Ni catalyst. After the calcination, the hydrotalcite structure was transferred into a mixed oxide [22]. A detailed description on preparation and characterization of the multifunctional catalyst used in the present work has previously been reported elsewhere [22]. The calcinated catalyst has a BET surface area of 94 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 6 nm. The formation of Co–Ni alloy was confirmed by TPR and SEM–EDX mapping [22] and the surface area of Co–Ni alloy is 23.3 m2 g−1 measured by hydrogen chemisorption, corresponding to a dispersion of 8.7%."
4,CO2 sorbent,"2.3 CO2 sorbent Arctic dolomite, used as precursor of Ca for CO2 capture was supplied by Franefoss Miljøkalk A/S, Norway. It is documented to have a purity of approximately 98.5 wt% CaMg(CO3)2 and no sulfur according to X-ray fluorescence analysis. The dolomite sample was calcined in a muffle oven in air flow at 900 °C for 4 h prior to its application as CO2 sorbent. The initial maximum capacity for CO2 capture was estimated at ca. 46% (mass of CO2 captured/100 g of calcined sorbent)."
5,Process tests,"2.4 Process tests The experimental setup used in the SESR experiments of the crude glycerol is shown, as a schematic diagram, in Fig. 1 . It consists of a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 9 mm), which was loaded with a 12 g mixture of CO2 sorbent (calcined dolomite) and Ni–Co/HT catalyst, at a sorbent/catalyst = 5 g/g. The reactant mixture was prepared with water to CGLY at a molar ratio of 9 (38 wt% CGLY, steam/C of 3). Lower water to CGLY ratios are limited by high viscosity, and also would cause carbon build up on the catalyst surface [26,27]. The mixture were kept in a liquid storage and feed tank. Gas and liquid flows were controlled by Bronkhorst® mass flow controllers. There is a high potential of coke formation due to the presence of non-volatile high molecular biodiesel (C17–C19 oxygenates) as well as highly oxygenated glycerol in the vaporizer, which easily blocks the tubes and vaporizer. The cold mixture of crude glycerol and water is then directly injected to the top of reactor and directly vaporized at the top of the catalyst and sorbent bed. A typical operation procedure is described as the following. Prior to the reforming reactions, the Ni–Co/HT catalyst was activated by reducing metal oxides under a flowing gas mixture of 50 vol% H2–N2 with a total flow rate of 200 Nml min−1 at 670 °C for 10 h. After catalyst reduction, the reactor was purged with N2 and cooled down to the desired reaction temperature (525–600 °C). The reaction temperature was measured by a thermocouple inserted in the catalyst/sorbent bed. All the experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure. The liquid reactant mixture, at a flow of 5–10 g h−1, was swept by 75–150 Nml min−1 N2 flow to keep the N2/C ratio constant, which also was employed as internal standard, directly to the liquid injector on the top of the reactor. The SESR of CGLY occurred until the calcined dolomite, as CO2 sorbent, was saturated and lost its capacity for CO2 removal. Afterward, the conventional SR and WGS reactions took place, which were allowed to reach the steady state to compare with SESR. The catalyst and sorbent were regenerated at 770 °C in air flow (200 Nml min−1), until CO2 levels dropped less than 1 vol%. A lower temperature for the regeneration is always highly desired to achieve higher energy efficiency. The temperature of 770 °C was selected by preliminary experiments by taking into account the kinetic of the decarbonation of dolomites [23]. The effluent gas from the reactor was cooled down through a cooling tank, followed by a moisture separation through a membrane drier. The exiting gas was analyzed with an on-line Agilent® 3000 dual channel Micro GC, equipped with a Molsieve and Plot U columns and a TCD detector. The calculation of the product distribution was based on the dry composition in the gas effluent. The species detected were H2, CH4, CO and CO2. The flow rates of these species were estimated based on the N2 flow rate as the inert standard. In this work, H2 yield, H2 purity and the catalyst selectivity to hydrogen were defined according to Eqs. (2)–(4), respectively. (2) H 2 yield = 100 · [ F H 2 7.08 · F CGLY ] (3) H 2 purity = 100 · [ y H 2 ∑ i y i ] (4) H 2 selectivity = 100 · [ y H 2 · 2 y H 2 · 2 + y C H 4 · 4 ] where F H 2 is the molar flow rate of H2 (mol min−1), F CGLY is the molar flow rate of CGLY (mol min−1), and y i is the molar content (N2 free and dry basis) of each specie i (H2, CH4, CO and CO2). The F CGLY was obtained by the 0.965 weight of crude glycerol divided by the molecular weight of C3H8.95O3.4, where the inorganic salts (approximately 3.5 wt%) were subtracted by a factor of 0.965. The spatial time (τ) is defined as the ratio of the weight of catalyst bed to CGLY fed per hour (gcatalyst gCGLY −1 h)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,High purity hydrogen from SESR of CGLY,"3.1 High purity hydrogen from SESR of CGLY Fig. 2 shows a typical profile of the evolution of the product gas composition in a N2 free and dry basis during a SESR experiment of CGLY over a mixture of the Ni–Co/HT catalyst and calcined dolomite as CO2 sorbent. In this case, the experiment was carried out at 550 °C and 1 atm, with a steam/C = 3, at a liquid flow rate of 5 g h−1 (τ = 1.09 h). Because of its nature, the SESR reaction has a very strong dependence on the CO2 removal. It is well-known that the CaO–CO2 reaction has a fast reaction regime, followed by a fairly slow reaction regime controlled by CO2 diffusion through the layer of solid CaCO3 product formed on the CaO [28,29]. Fig. 2, shows three regimes of the reaction with time on stream, namely pre-breakthrough, breakthrough and post-breakthrough. In the pre-breakthrough regime, the most of CO2 generated by steam reforming and water–gas shift reactions was removed by the fast carbonation reaction with CaO, and led to a significant sorption enhancement to hydrogen production. The breakthrough period reflects the transition of the CaO carbonation from the first fast reaction to the second diffusion controlled and relatively slow regime. When the CaO became saturated, the sorption enhancement disappeared in the post-breakthrough regime, and products are dominated by SR as well as the WGS reaction. In the pre-breakthrough period, very low CO and CO2 concentrations were observed as a result of shifted WGS equilibrium toward H2 production by in-situ CO2 removal. The methane concentration was also much lower during the pre-breakthrough period than during the post-breakthrough, where the conventional SR reaction takes place. It can be a result of enhanced reforming of CH4, or/and suppressed CO methanation by lowering CO concentration caused by in-situ CO2 removal, which could not be distinguished in the present work. No oxygenates were detected in both the gas phase and the condensed water, suggesting 100% conversion of the mixed oxygenates. In contrast to work of Valliyappan et al. [7], no large hydrocarbons (C1 +) were detected at both the SESR and SR conditions in the present work. These results reflect a high C–C bond cleavage ability of the Ni–Co catalyst, and thus the high activity of large oxygenates and heavy hydrocarbon reforming reactions. As a consequence, a high H2 purity (99.7 vol%) was achieved with a very low concentration of methane."
8,Effects of temperature on hydrogen purity and yield,"3.2 Effects of temperature on hydrogen purity and yield Table 1 summarizes the experimental results obtained during the SESR process of CGLY at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 525 and 600 °C. Very high selectivity of the catalyst to H2 production (>99%) was obtained, with a relatively weak dependence on the temperature. CO concentration decreased concurrently with decreasing temperature, which might be a consequence of favorable thermodynamics of WGS reaction at lower temperatures. The minimum CO2 concentration was achieved at 550 °C as a result of a balance between the fast carbonation kinetics at relatively high temperatures and favorable thermodynamics at low temperatures. The exothermic carbonation reaction is unfavorable at high temperatures, where the carbonation kinetics could be also lowered by lower driving forces between the CO2 pressures in the gas phase and CO2 equilibrium pressure. This led to a weaker sorption enhancement at 600 °C, reflecting a higher concentration of CO2 and CH4 and lower H2 purity. On the other hand, it further confirms the synergistic effect between the catalytic SR and CO2 carbonation reactions in the sorbent/catalyst bed, being the clear advantages of the sorption enhanced reaction leading to an enhanced H2 production by shifting the equilibrium of water–gas shift reaction. The highest H2 purity (99.7 vol%) was achieved at both 550 and 575 °C, but 550 °C is a preferable operating temperature in terms of the lower CO concentration (1.2 × 10−2 vol% in Table 1), although the methane concentration is lower at 575 °C. The higher H2 purity (99.7 vol% at 575 °C and steam/C = 3) was obtained comparing to the results obtained for SESR of pure glycerol [18] at the same experimental conditions (approximately 99 vol%). It could be ascribed to the presence of oxygenates with high carbon numbers, such as C17–C19 esters [21]. Thermodynamic analysis has indicated that the sorption enhancement on H2 production is more pronounced for the large oxygenates [21]. In addition, the presence of methanol in crude glycerol could also contribute to the obtained high H2 purity, due to its higher reactivity comparing to the C2 + oxygenated hydrocarbons. Methanol reforming does not require C–C bond cleavage and has low tendency to methane formation [30]. The spatial time (τ) used in the present work (1.09 h) for the study of the temperature effect is similar to the one used in the aqueous reforming of sorbitol, glycerol and ethylene glycol on Ni [31] and Pt based catalysts [32]. SESR of CGLY is superior to the aqueous reforming in terms of H2 purity and yield [31,32]. However, a comparison of the energy efficiency between the two processes is not straightforward, which needs to be further investigated."
9,Effects of spatial time,"3.3 Effects of spatial time The effect of the spatial time was studied by adjusting the flow rates of the liquid reactant mixture (CGLY and water) and N2 on the same amount of catalysts and sorbents for all the experiments. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the spatial time (τ) on the H2 yield (%) and purity (vol%) during the SESR of CGLY at 550 °C and atmospheric pressure. The H2 purity remained nearly constant (99.5–99.7 vol%), whilst the H2 yield decreased drastically from 88.1 to 45.3%, when τ was decreased from 1.09 to 0.54 h. The methane and CO contents are only slightly increased with increasing the spatial time. The SESR reaction integrated steam reforming of oxygenates and hydrocarbons, water gas shift reaction and carbonation reaction into one stage. The results (Fig. 3) indicate the reaction rate of water–gas shift and methane reforming are high enough making reactions close to equilibrium at the conditions studied [18]. However, the yield of H2 decreased almost linearly with decreasing spatial time, suggesting a much lower reaction rate of CGLY reforming than ones of methane reforming and water–gas shift reactions. It reveals that the CGLY reforming with the C–C bond cleavage is the limiting step for the hydrogen production. The activity of the reforming catalysts for the oxygenate reforming, in particular the C–C bond cleavage activity, should be further improved."
10,Coke formation and materials stability,"3.4 Coke formation and materials stability The hydrogen yield in this work is limited to between 85 and 88% at τ of 1.09 h, which is lower comparing to the ca. 99% of hydrogen yield obtained from SESR of pure glycerol at the same steam/C ratio of 3 [18]. It is most likely a result of carbonaceous materials formation from CGLY, such as coke. The poor stability of heavy components in CGLY (for instance, fatty acid methyl esters) as impurities in crude glycerol could lead to the pyrolysis reactions in the gas phase front the catalytic bed, promoting the coke formation. This behavior is in agreement with those observed by Dou and co-workers who reported by TGA pyrolysis experiments [33] and SESR experiments [19] that crude glycerol yielded larger carbonaceous residues than pure glycerol. Fig. 4 shows a typical distribution of carbon formed along the catalysts bed, indicated by the changes in the color of the sample collected from the top to the bottom of the reactor bed (from left to right in the figure). The most of the carbonaceous materials were formed on the top of the catalyst/acceptor bed as well as the wall at the reactor inlet. The poorly stable heavier reactants could form oxygenated intermediates by pyrolysis at the inlet of the reactor, which could convert to either gases or coke. When the spatial time was decreased, coke formed also in a relatively deep bed in the reactor. In the sample close to the bottom of the reactor, the black particles are the Ni–Co catalyst. The more detailed characterization of coke will be discussed below. However, it should be noted that the hydrogen yield and purity, instead of composition only, should be studied in the steam reforming or sorption enhanced reforming, which is often ignored in the literature. Carbonaceous deposits at the top of the material bed were collected after the SESR of CGLY at 550 °C and spatial times of 1.09 and 0.73 h, and passed to SEM–EDX and Raman spectroscopic study to gain the insight of the nature of the carbonaceous material formed in the reaction. Fig. 5 a shows a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image and the Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis of the formed coke on top of the catalyst–sorbent bed. Coke was mainly composed by C (>59 wt%), which was deposited at the top of the bed, and also on the surface of the catalyst particles, represented by the presence of Al, Ni and Co (≈2–3 wt%) in the collected coke. It should be pointed that a high Na presence (17 wt%) in the coke, which obviously comes from the inorganic salts (NaOH) in the crude glycerol. The NaOH is often used as the catalyst in biodiesel production. Fig. 5b exhibits the UV Raman spectra of the coke formed after the SESR of CGLY at τ of 1.09 h (b-1) and 0.73 h (b-2), respectively, in which the two first-order more representative bands of carbonaceous materials appear. The first, at around 1400 cm−1 is caused by defects and disorder in the graphene-like structure and is denoted as D band. The G band at 1600 cm−1 is associated with graphite sheets. The intensity ratio of the bands, I D/I G, gives a measure of the degree of crystallinity of the graphite layers. The low I D/I G ratio (≈0.52) for carbonaceous deposits formed at high spatial time (1.09 h) observed in the first spectrum (b-1), would correspond to a high-graphitic coke with only few structural defects. Microelemental analysis was also carried out in order to find out the hydrogen content in the coke. The amount of C, H and O consisted of 39.9, 0.5 and 59.6 wt%, respectively, which gives a C/H molar ratio of 7.13, which is in line with the highly graphitic structure revealed by Raman. However, in the case of the carbonaceous deposits formed at lower spatial time the I D/I G ratio increases up to 0.77 (Fig. 5 b-2), revealing a more disordered structure. In this case, C, H and O contents in the coke were 53.8, 4.4 and 41.8 wt%, respectively, with a C/H molar ratio of 1.03, pointing out a less graphitized coke with higher H content. Based on the above results and discussions, we summarize the main challenges in the SESR of crude glycerol, namely carbon formation due to the presence of non-volatile heavy compounds, such as C17–C19 acid methyl esters, and accumulation of alkaline due to the presence of NaOH Therefore, the cycle stability of the catalyst and the CO2 sorbents could be a challenge in the SESR of CGLY due to the complexity of the feedstock. Three cycles of SESR of CGLY were performed, 550 °C SESR reaction and 770 °C regeneration in air, to test the stability of the catalyst and CO2 sorbent. There are two reasons to use air in the regeneration. The first is air being much cheaper comparing to other inert gases or steam, which dilutes the CO2 released thus lower the decarbonation temperature of the dolomites. The second is that oxygen in the air could burn off the coke deposits at the top of the bed and on the catalyst surface, which regenerates the catalysts, and partially provides heat for the decarbonation of the dolomites. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the H2 and CO2 concentrations in a N2 free and dry basis, where CO and CH4 concentrations were not plotted, because they followed a similar trend to CO2. During the pre-breakthrough, the H2 (99.7 vol%) and CO2 (1.0–1.6 × 10−2 vol%) concentrations kept on the same levels after 3 cycles, indicating no significant deactivation of the catalyst, although a relatively high content of Na was detected in the carbonaceous deposits. A slight decrease in the breakthrough time of CO2 (Fig. 6) and rather similar slopes of the breakthrough curves in these three cycles are observed, suggesting a mild change in the kinetics and CO2 capture capacity, which is similar to that observed in SESR of methane [34,35], and ethanol [23]. The CO2 breakthrough time decreases slightly with increasing cycle number as a result of a loss of the CO2 capacity of the sorbents [23,34,35]. The amount of CO2 captured was calculated as the difference of the flow rate of CO2 (g min−1) between the SR and SESR regimes, multiplied by the breakthrough time (min). The capture capacities, defined as the mass of CO2 captured per 100 g of calcined dolomite, observed in this work were 43.3, 37.4 and 34.5% for cycles 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Although the deactivation of carbonation was observed, the deactivation rate was found to be much slower comparing to one in the SESR of ethanol, where almost 50% loss of the CaO activity was found after the first cycle [23]. This might suggest that not only no significant deactivation of the Ni–Co catalysts after 3 reaction–regeneration cycles was caused by the inorganic salts in the crude glycerol but also that the presence of these salts could have some positive effect on the stability of the dolomite in the carbonation–decarbonation cycles. However, the effects of inorganic salts on the long term stability of both catalysts and CO2 sorbents need to be investigated in a more detail in future studies."
11,Conclusions,"High purity (99.7 vol%) and high yield (88%) H2 can be produced directly from crude glycerol in a single-step SESR process on Ni–Co catalysts, where in-situ removal of CO2 by dolomite greatly enhanced reforming reactions and water–gas shift reactions. The reaction rates of methane reforming and water–gas shift reactions are much higher than the steam reforming of crude glycerol on Ni–Co catalysts. Take advantages of high activity of water–gas shift reaction at the conditions with in-situ CO2 removal, the high purity of hydrogen can be obtained at relatively low spatial time, or at low crude glycerol conversions. The results also reveal that future research needs to improve the catalyst activity for steam reforming of crude glycerol. In addition, although the CO level (about 100 ppm) in the H2 stream obtained from the SESR of the crude glycerol is still slightly high for its application in low temperature fuel cells, many other fuel cell technologies, such as high temperature fuel cells and acid fuel cells, can benefit from such high purity of hydrogen [36]. However, it will be of great interests to optimize the materials, operating conditions and reactor design to further reduce the coke formation and the CO concentration for the application in low temperature fuel cells. More importantly, the SESR of crude glycerol with a complex composition can be considered as a model system, which has demonstrated that could have great potential to upgrade other biomass derived complex mixtures such as bio-oils to high purity hydrogen. It is believed that SESR will play an important role in future biomass conversion to clean energy."
