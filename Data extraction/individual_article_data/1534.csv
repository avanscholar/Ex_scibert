0,Introduction,"Since fossil fuels have a long process of regeneration, their availability is gradually decreasing [1–3]. The acceleration in fossil fuel demand increases researchers' attention to discover new, renewable, and clean energy sources. The main objective of the first applications is to reduce dependence on petroleum, to increase fuel economy and efficiency. By the time reduction of emissions is added to these targets. Applications such as electric vehicles and hydrogen technology include long-term transformations. For short-term and result-oriented solutions, available applications are needed for existing systems. Diesel engines are used all over the world because of their durability and high fuel efficiency. The conventional diesel fuel obtained from the distillation of crude oil is used as fuel for the operation of these engines. It is known that oil resources in the world are decreasing gradually, and diesel fuel production becomes more expensive by the time [4]. Vehicles using diesel engines are preferred in transportation, agriculture, and energy production sectors due to their high-power output, high fuel conversion efficiency, and higher torque capacities than gasoline engines [5]. It has been determined that there is an increase in the industrial production and transportation needs of the two elements that have a significant impact on global warming and climate change. Emissions from diesel engines are harmful to human health and the environment and should be kept within specified limits [6]. As a result, the goal is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and emission output, while also improving efficiency through research in the field of engines. Biodiesel is known as a fatty acid alkyl esters compound obtained by chemical reactions of animal and vegetable oils with alcohol [7–9]. It is produced by the reaction of biodiesel raw material (oil) with alcohol (ethanol-methanol) and catalyst (Potassium Hydroxide-Sodium Hydroxide). The resulting product is called biodiesel or Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME). Transesterification, microemulsion, pyrolysis, and dilution are common methods used in the production of biodiesel [10]. Biodiesel fuels have a higher density and lower compressibility compared to conventional diesel fuels due to their high molecular weights. The amount of fuel sent to the engine is affected by density and viscosity. Atomization quality and droplet size are significant problems, especially at high loads [11,12]. Biodiesel can be used purely or as a mixture in diesel cycle engines. It is preferred as an alternative fuel due to high cetane number and thermal value and decrease exhaust emission values and to be used as engine fuel without modification. It is mostly obtained from vegetable oils and waste oils. It is an economical fuel that can be used instead of diesel fuel and less harmful to the environment. It is also a useful fuel in terms of getting rid of the environmental damage caused by waste oils [13]. Biodiesel is an essential alternative to diesel fuel. It is possible to use directly and in the form of a mixture, without any modification in the motor. The most critical problem encountered is due to high density. Problems in using pure or highly biodiesel mixtures can be solved by mixing a secondary fuel due to its low viscosity, density, and better fluidity [14,15]. Researchers are, therefore, focused on alternative fuels. In applications, the use of alcohol as a fuel additive and as a mixture has an important place. In order to use biodiesel as an alternative fuel to diesel fuel, it is necessary to eliminate viscosity related problems [16,17]. For the use of two alternative fuels, such as vegetable oil and alcohol, a mixture by microemulsion can be created. The rate of biofuel use in diesel engines can be increased in this way. Low-carbon alcohols (such as methanol and ethanol) have restrictions for direct use due to poor lubricity, low cetane number, heating values, and low-temperature separation properties [18–20]. Alcohols are clean fuels due to their molecular structure hydroxyl (OH) and can be mixed with diesel and biodiesel fuels. Low viscosity and alcohol density make it possible to use vegetable oils in diesel engines. When a mixture of biodiesel and alcohols is used, the engine's braking power and brake specific fuel consumption improved compared to biodiesel use [21,22]. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions decreased while nitric oxide and carbon dioxide increased [23]. Emissions from the use of diesel engines adversely affect human health and the environment. Developed countries aim to find new economical and environmentally friendly alternative energy sources to reduce CO2 emissions in the long term. As new alternatives will help reduce dependence on petroleum-based fuels, countries are now working harder to increase the usage of biofuels. If renewable fuels are easily accessible, they could be part of the solution. Biodiesel and bio-alcohols are promising fuels that can be used in diesel engines [24–26]. It is known from the literature studies that alcohol can be used as an additive or single fuel in internal combustion engines. Its usage has been limited in the past due to its higher cost compared to petroleum-based fuels. Today, this problem is overcome with industrial developments. Developed countries are making legal regulations to encourage the use of alcohol in internal combustion engines [15]. Literature studies on the use of alcohol in diesel engines are mostly methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), propanol (C3H7OH), pentanol (C5H11OH), and butanol (C4H9OH) has been used [27–29]. High alcohols are better than lower alcohols on calorific value, diesel fuel mixing stability, density, viscosity, lubrication, and cetane number properties. For this reason, it is more suitable to use with diesel fuels [30]. Researchers are examining the use of high-alcohol alcohols closer to diesel, in particular, rather than low-chain alcohols as diesel fuel mixtures. They described high alcohols as long-chain alcohol with higher molecular weight and containing more than three carbon atoms (butanol (C4H9OH), pentanol (C5H11OH), octanol (C8H17OH)). It can be stated that higher alcohols have more suitable potential (higher energy content, blend stability) for diesel engine applications than low alcohols [31]. Compared to lower alcohols, it is a good alternative fuel for diesel engines due to higher alcohols, higher calorific values, better mixture stability with diesel fuel, higher density, higher viscosity, and higher cetane number [27]. Different biodiesel-alcohol mixtures were tested in a diesel engine. NOx emission was reduced while brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, ignition delay, heat dissipation rate, PM, and smoke emissions increased [32]. To reduce the disadvantages of the single-use of biodiesel and alcohol, mixing low and high alcohol into the biodiesel can improve the properties of the fuel. Low viscosity and high volatility properties of alcohols can be increased by adding biodiesel. With this approach, since the oxygen content of the mixed fuel increases, it can improve the combustion process. The ignition delay is prolonged due to high latent evaporation heat and low cetane number. Higher heat release and lower in-cylinder pressure are observed compared to diesel fuel. Spray properties improve due to the low density and viscosity of alcohol. With the effect of the oxygen content in alcohol fuels, a more complete combustion occurs. With this effect, an increase in thermal efficiency, a decrease in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and particulate matter (PM) emissions are observed [33]. Propanol is a three-carbon saturated aliphatic alcohol. It is very similar to ethyl alcohol with its chemistry and properties. It is colorless, fluid, poisonous, and formulated as C3H8O. During the production of methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the by-product is formed as propanol. N propanol is used in industry as an important organic material, solvent, and antifreeze. The propanol is contained three carbons and belongs to the saturated aliphatic alcohol group. Its chemical properties are very similar to ethanol. Propanol is derived from carbon monoxide and hydrogen as a by-product during the Fischer-Tropsch reaction (oxidation of propane and butane). Butanol is four-carbon alcohol, and its chemical formula is C4H9OH. It is used as solvent and fuel. Generally used for perfume making and detergent manufacturing in the cosmetic industry. It mixes with alcohol and ethers in every ratio. An important feature of butanol is that it mixes with gasoline at high rates. Butanol, produced only by some Clostridium species biologically, is one of the most important fuels that can be an alternative to fossil fuels. Butanol has more energy content than ethanol. Butanol is more toxic than other alcohols. It can be produced from the fermentation of agricultural products or crude oil. Energy content is high, and the vapor pressure is low, it contains about 20% oxygen, it affects the combustion efficiency positively in the mixtures. It has been reported that with the addition of n-butanol to diesel, the maximum pressure increase rate and BSFC increased, NOx and soot emissions decreased [21]. Octanol is a fatty alcohol and formulated as C8H18O. A colorless, slightly viscous liquid, floats on water, its vapor heavier than air, and generally used as a solvent. Octanol is produced from petroleum-based processes. Cetane number, low vapor pressure, calorific values are better than other high alcohols. It has higher calorific value, better self-ignition quality, and phase stability than octanol low alcohols, providing significant benefits with the use of pure or mixed [34]. Octanol can be used in diesel engines at different engine loads due to its high cetane number. Pentanol is an alcohol derivative which is a colorless, slightly fragrant, flammable, poisonous, and harmful to the skin and eye. The chemical formula is C5H12O. Pentanol contains five carbons, compounds of different structures are available has the same chemical formula. Steam is separated by the production of acetylene, ethylene, propylene, and other compounds. Sodium amalgam is used to reduce the mixture of trimethyl acetic acid, and trimethylacetyl chloride and tertiary butyl carbinol are obtained. Biodiesel and diesel blends have been successfully tested in CI engines, showing slightly different results depending on the different biomass type of biodiesel. Emissions and efficiency can differ due to properties such as viscosity, specific density and flash point [29]. Biodiesel has a higher viscosity and density that exceed the limit values for standard diesel fuel. Alcohols are one of the alternative fuels that have been investigated. They have high evaporation heat, flame speed and octane rating. Researchers has focused on investigation of the alcohol and biodiesel blend. By adding alcohol to biodiesel, the density of biodiesel is reduced and fuel atomization improves. At the same time, it increases the combustion efficiency and decreases the CO2, CO and HC emissions [32]. In the present investigation, the effect of heavy alcohols, namely, propanol, butanol, pethanol, and octanol, on the usability of safflower oils biodiesel, has been experimentally investigated by blending 20% of these alcohols with the biodiesel. The experimental test results of the diesel engine with the specified mixture fuels were compared with each other as well as with ULSD and pure biodiesel. The effects of addition of the heavy alcohols to biodiesel on combustion, performance, and emissions of the diesel engine were comparatively found as a novel. The originality of this study has been highlighted to be the combined use of two alternative fuels namely safflower oil biodiesel and higher alcohols to diesel fuel. Higher alcohols were used to improve the usability of biodiesel, known as the main alternative fuel. Mixing ratio is limited to 20%, especially considering eliminate the further viscosity based solubility problems. Although there are similar studies in the literature, partial investigations have been made and the effects of alcohol with ternary fuel applications have not been clearly expressed. In this application, the effects of adding different higher alcohols to pure biodiesel were deeply investigated."
1,Material and method,"The experiments were carried out in the internal combustion engine laboratory in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Batman University Faculty of Engineering. A schematic picture of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . Experiments were carried out using a four-cylinder, four strokes, direct injection, and water-cooled NWK22 diesel engine. The technical characteristics of the engine are shown in Table 1 . A diesel engine power generator was used in the study. Equivalent electrical resistances were used for engine loading. In order to increase the accuracy of fuel comparisons, the constant engine load and 1500 rpm constant engine speed were studied. The test parameters were determined based on the averages of five testing data values. The effects of the use of safflower biodiesel and alcohol mix on the diesel generator were analyzed experimentally. Safflower oil and transesterification were chosen as raw material and method for biodiesel production, and literature data were taken into consideration [35]. The alcohols were mixed with 20% by mass to the pure safflower biodiesel. Data were collected using PR20, PE20, BU20, and OC20, respectively, and the performance, combustion, and emission data were compared with pure biodiesel (B100) and diesel fuel (ULSD). Table 2 gives the basic properties of test fuels. Propanol, pentanol, butanol and octanol heavy fuels were chosen as additional fuel and mixed into the biodiesel at a 20% ratio. Comparisons were made between diesel, biodiesel, and biodiesel-alcohol blends. Fuel consumption values were determined by measuring the fuel mass with the help of precision scales. CAPALEC CAP 3200 emission analyzing device was used to determine the exhaust emissions. The analyzer is equipped with a NOx sensor. The exhaust gas temperatures were determined using a non-contact digital thermometer. Technical properties of the gas analyzing device are given in Table 3 . The tests were carried out at certain loads corresponding to idle 25%, 50%, and 75% of the full load of the engine. FEBRIS combustion analysis software with a pressure sensor was integrated into the engine for combustion analysis. Cylinder pressure, mass fraction burned (MFB), heat release rate (HRR), and average gas temperature (MGT) change data were collected according to the crank angle change, with this software. The values were determined by taking an average of 100 cycles for each CAD. Necessary calculations were made based on the first law of thermodynamics."
2,Calculated parameters,"Combustion data were collected and analyzed by FEBRIS software. The cylinder volume, cylinder pressure, piston speed, and piston acceleration can be determined by the program based on the crank angle. Cylinder pressure, HRR, MGT, and MFB was calculated by the program based on these data. The heat release rate is calculated by the following equation [39,40], (1) dQ d θ = γ γ - 1 p dV d θ + 1 γ - 1 V dp d θ (2) V = V c + A . r { 1 - c o s π A 180 + 1 λ 1 - 1 - λ 2 sin 2 π θ 180 (3) λ = l r A = π D 2 4 where θ is the crank angle, γ is the ratio of specific heats which has been taken as 1.32, P is cylinder gas pressure, and V is cylinder volume, r is crank radius H/2, l is connecting rod length, D is cylinder diameter, A is piston top area, and Vc is stroke volume. Due to the heat transfer between the gas and cylinder walls, there are partial losses in the heat generated during the combustion. This situation is expressed as follows; (4) d Q w d θ = h A ( T - T w ) Heat transfer coefficient was examined as follows; (5) h c = C 1 V - 0.06 P 0.8 T - 0.4 [ C m + C 2 ] 0.8 hc (heat transfer coefficient), V (instant cylinder volume), P(instant cylinder pressure), T (gas temperature), Cm (piston speed), C1, and C2 constants are determined to be 130 and 1.4 experimentally [41]. The mean gas temperature is determined from the local average of the gas temperature in the combustion chamber. Since the combustion chamber is considered an ideal mixed volume, the average gas temperature can be determined from the ideal gas state equation [39]. Constant local temperatures are generally used for piston and cylinder temperatures. The development of the expansion stroke is considered polytropic, and the average gas temperature is calculated by the following equation. (6) T i = P i V i T ref P ref V ref Here Ti expresses the mean gas temperature, Pi and Vi express simultaneous pressure, and cylinder volume, Tref, Pref, and Vref represent the reference parameters at any point of the polytrophic expansion curve. With the help of the following equation known as the Wiebe function, the mass fraction burned was calculated [42]. The Wiebe function is often used to characterize the burning process and is an S-shaped curve. Its profile develops from zero to one; zero indicates the beginning of combustion, and one indicates the end of combustion. As the duration of combustion, space between zero and one position is accepted. (7) x θ = b 1 - e - a θ - θ 0 Δ θ 0 m + 1 The efficiency parameter of the Wiebe function is symbolized by a. The amplitude correction factor b, form factor m, crank angle θ, burning time Δθ, burning start of the Wiebe function are indicated by 0. Here, a is 5, and m is 2, and b is 1. Performance parameters were calculated from the following equations. Mass fuel consumption was calculated by the following Eq. (8). (8) B = m y t ∗ 60 1000 ( k g / h ) my: amount of fuel measured (gr) t: time (min) B: Fuel consumption (kg/h) By considering the amount of fuel consumed and the power drawn from the engine, the specific fuel consumption is calculated with the formula of Eq. (9). (9) BSFC = m y P e ( g / k W h ) where my is mass fuel consumption value of the fuel (kg/h), Pe is the brake power (kWh). Effective efficiency was calculated with the formula in Eq. (10). (10) η e = 3.6 ∗ 10 6 b e ∗ H u where Hu is lower heating value of the fuel (kJ/kg), be is the brake specific fuel consumption (kg/kWh). The lower heating values of the blend fuels were calculated by the following formula in Eq. (11). (11) H u = ( m y ) 1 ∗ ( H u ) 1 + ⋯ + ( m y ) n ∗ ( H u ) n m y 1 + ⋯ + m y n Using Eq. (12), brake specific energy consumption of test fuels was calculated. (12) BSEC ( k J / k W h ) = m y x H u P e"
3,Results and discussions,
4,Performance evaluations,"4.1 Performance evaluations The change of the experimental parameters related to determining engine performance is given in this section. Variation of mass fuel consumption values depending on the load is given in Fig. 2 . Fuel consumption is converted to the heat energy released by combustion. As can be seen from the graphic, the lowest MFC values were realized in ULSD fuel. Values increased in the order of OC20, PE20, BU20, B100, and PR20, respectively obeying with the lower heating values of the blend fuels. The difference between alcohol blends tends to close after medium loads. OC20 and Fuel consumption increased values were increased with the increase in load and the values of octanol based OC20 seem to be very close to those of ULSD values. As expected, the addition of alcohol causes an increase in fuel consumption due to the decrease in lower heat values. The increase in B100 fuel is thought to be due to high viscosity and lower heating value, as well. The lowest value in alcohol mixtures was for OC20 with 1.05–3.4 kg/h. The change in ULSD under the same conditions is in the range of 1.03–3.28 kg/h. There is a 3.5% increase on OC20 compared to diesel. There is a maximum increase of 4.7% in other alcohols compared to OC20. The variation of BSFC values depending on the load are given in Fig. 3 . BSFC is an important parameter used in the performance evaluation of internal combustion engines. It is explained as the amount of fuel consumed for per unit power output. BSFC values were higher in the order of PR20, B100, BU20, PE20, OC20, and ULSD. With the increased load, the values of BSFC were decreased, and the difference between fuels decreases after the middle loads. BSFC values at 75% load were 0.30 kg/kWh in diesel and 0.314 kg/kWh in OC20. An increase of 9.6% was determined compared to ULSD. The values of other fuels were very close to each other. Compared to the OC20, there was a maximum of 4.7% increase for the other alcohol blends. The reason for the lowered BSCF values for OC20 is considered to be the higher calorific value of octanol in comparison to the other alcohols. The BSEC values of the test engine running with alcohol blended biodiesel fuels of OC20, PE20, BU20 and PR20 when comparing with fuels of B100 and ULSD at partials are presented in Fig. 4 . As shown in the figure that BSEC values for all test fuels were decreased with the increment of the engine operation load absolutely due to the improved combustion environment thanks to the increase of in-cylinder combustion temperature. When the effects of the test fuels are taken into consideration, it can be seen that the lowest energy consumption values were ever obtained for propanol based blend fuel PR20. It can be attributed to the improved evaporation and mixing properties alcohols of which in-cylinder air–fuel mixture is the more homogeneous charge and leading to accelerated combustion and, consequently, more efficient combustion. The same conditions were also observed for all alcohol blend fuels at medium and higher loads of the engine operations. Therefore, the usage of heavy alcohols by blending with biodiesel in diesel engines at certain amounts considerably improves engine efficiency. Fig. 5 shows the change in brake thermal efficiency values depending on the load. Brake thermal efficiency is determined from the engine brake power and with the fuel energy supplied as the fuel. It can be considered as the most critical parameter for the engine in energy analysis. The highest brake thermal efficiency values were obtained in the order of OC20, ULSD, PE20, BU20, B100 and PR20 test fuels under low load conditions. Contrary to the low load conditions, the brake thermal efficiency of the alcohol blended biodiesel fuels were higher than those of ULSD under medium and higher load conditions that can be attributed to the improved combustion environment and accelerated combustion characteristics of the alcohols due to their better evaporation and mixing properties in comparison to diesel fuel. Besides, it can be stated that the oxygen content of alcohols aided in the diffusion combustion phase and increased BTE. The change in thermal efficiency for OC20 was between 18.8% and 28.9% under low to higher loads, while for ULSD, it was in the range of 17.3 to 27%. Thermal values of OC20 were averagely increased by about 7% when compared to diesel fuel. For the other alcohols, the values of thermal efficiency are very close, and the differences do not exceed 1% [43–45]. Fig. 6 shows the change in CO emission values depending on the load. The higher CO values were obtained in the order of B100, ULSD, BU20, PR20, PE20, OC20. The lowest CO values were ever obtained for OC20. OC20 values were in the range of 0.075–0.06%, while ULSD has CO levels between 0.08 and 0.07 %. Compared to diesel, about 14% improvement was observed in CO emissions. Other alcohol data is very close to OC20. It can no doubt be related to the oxygen contents of alcohols and biodiesel. The higher CO emissions that formed in usage of B100 fuel can be explained by a higher adiabatic flame temperature of biodiesel. Diesel engines often operate in the poor fuel–air mixing zone. For this reason, since do not exceed the limits, the CO emission is not a very important emission for the diesel engine. Low combustion temperature and low oxygen concentration are effective in increasing CO emissions. As expected, the values decreased until the engine load reached 50% and reached to the minimum level, then increased due to the increased fuel amounts in the air–fuel mixture. It is reported that the CO emissions are reduced with temperature rise at high loads. Oxidation of carbon monoxide can be attributed to the high oxygen content of the mixtures [46]. Fig. 7 shows the change in HC emission values depending on the load. The higher level of HC values was obtained for test fuels in the order of B100, PR20, BU20, PE20, ULSD, OC20. The lowest HC emission values have been obtained in the order of OC20, ULSD, PE20, BU20, PR20, B100. The lowest values were ever obtained for OC20, while the highest values were ever obtained for B100. For OC20, HC values were in the range of 24–40 ppm, while for ULSD, they were realized as between 25 and 44 ppm. Compared to diesel, a 9% reduction was observed for OC20. Other alcohol data was very close to OC20, and the difference was around 12%. If the air–fuel mixture becomes poor, the HC concentration decreases. However, after exceeding a certain point, the HC concentration begins to increase again. The excessive impoverishment of the mixture prolongs the combustion time of the fuel. It is stated that if the amount of fuel in the air fuel mixture decreases, the fuel consumption will decrease. Excessive air in the combustion environment will lead to and decreased flame and thus in-cylinder temperature and eventually to an incomplete combustion so thus the formation of HC emissions. It leads to the formation of HC due to incomplete combustion. Higher latent heat of vaporization of alcohols causes a poor fuel–air mixture that increases HC emissions [37]. Therefore, HC emissions were obtained higher for alcohol blended biodiesel fuels except OC20. In the use of mixtures with high oxygen content, unburned hydrocarbons oxidation increases at relatively high cylinder temperatures, and HC emissions are reduced [46–48]. Fig. 8 shows the change in NOx emission values depending on the load. The highest NOx values were observed for B100, and it was followed by ULSD. The difference between other fuels is negligible. The lowest NOx emission values were obtained for the test fuel in order of PR20, BU20, PE20, OC20, ULSD, and B100. The NOx values of PR20 were in the range of 35–370 ppm’s, while they found for as 135–846 ppm’s for ULSD. Compared to diesel fuel, about 56% improvement was observed with PR20. For the other alcohols, data of NOx emissions are close to PR20. Spray properties (evaporation, penetration, and interaction of fuel, the momentum of fuel particles, and the size of particles) depend on properties of the fuel, such as viscosity and boiling temperature. All these physical factors affect the spray advance, ignition delay, premixed combustion, and flame spread, resulting in NOx formation. Nitrogen oxides are the most critical gas in vehicle emissions. The main reason for the release of NOx formation in diesel engines is the combustion temperature. As soon as the temperature inside the cylinder rises above 1800 °K, the NOx concentration begins to increase. In NOx formation, the temperature inside the cylinder, oxygen concentration, and the residence time of the gases in the cylinder is sufficient [49]. NOx emissions are generally reduced with the usage of alcohol as a mixture. That is because of the low adiabatic flame temperature and the higher latent heat of evaporation of alcohol based blend fuels, causing a cooling effect that leads to less NOx formation [48,50,51]. The variation of CO2 emission values depending on the load is given in Fig. 9 . Values are decreased in the order of OC20, ULSD, PE20, BU20, B100, PR20. B100 values tend to increase at medium loads. Emission values increased with the load increase that can be attributed to the improved combustion environment. Generally, CO2 emission values increased in B100, PR20, BU20, PE20, and OC20 alcohol blended fuels were lower in comparison to ULSD. While PR20 values were in the range o%1.88–7%, those of ULSD were 2.2–7.9%. Compared to diesel, a 4.4% improvement was observed. Other alcohol data is close to PR20. It is suitable to link the CO2 decrease for alcohol-based fuels to the excess oxygen content of alcohols and biodiesel and relatively low carbon in their chemical chains. Better combustion is seen, causing an increase in CO2 emissions and, accordingly, more CO's converted to CO2. It has been reported that high oxygen content increase the combustion quality, CO2 emission increases, and CO2 emissions can be inconsistent [52]. The variation of O2 emission values depending on the engine load is presented in Fig. 10 . O2 emission values increased in alcohol fuels of PR20, BU20, PE20, OC20 were higher in comparison to ULSD, which can be referred to as the higher oxygen concentration of the alcohols. O2 values of PR20 were in the range of 18.8–12.4%, while for ULSD, they were 17.7–10.9%. Compared to diesel, a 13.7% increase was observed for PR20. Other alcohol data was close at an average of 3% to PR20. It was observed that the combustion is improved in fuels with high oxygen content. Alcohol-containing mixture values are close to each other as well as B100, and ULSD values are close to each other. O2 emission values were decreased with a load increase for all test fuels."
5,Combustion evaluations,"4.2 Combustion evaluations The change of the most important and enlightening combustion parameters, namely the in-cylinder pressure, the HRR, MFB, and the MGT for the test fuels, are given in this section. The amount of fuel involved in combustion in the premixed combustion stage is important in the formation of cylinder pressure. High peak pressure corresponds to the proportion of fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase [53,54]. The alcohol blending decreased the peak pressure values. Although there is a partial decrease in OC20, it is close to ULSD. The highest cylinder pressure values were observed for ULSD and OC20 fuels, while the lowest pressure values were obtained with the PE20 and B100. The cylinder pressure curves of BU20 and PR20 were found to be in the between them. Peak values were positioned between 368 and 370 CAD at 75% load as 80.55 bars in diesel and 79.45 bars in OC20. There is only a 1.3% drop for OC20 when compared to ULSD. The highest decrease was observed in PR20 with 8% following diesel fuel. Pressure values in other fuels are analogously similar to each other. In alcohol use, the peak pressure points partially shifted to the expansion stroke. The decrease in the amount of fuel with low reactivity and the lower cetane number for alcohols delays the ignition except for OC20. The combustion seems to be delayed for B100, considering to be not because of the diesel index but the negative effect of high density and viscosity of B100 on combustion. Two important properties for the combustion and performance of the engine are viscosity and density. These parameters affect the droplet size, the formation of the spray, the development of the spray and the combustion properties. The addition of alcohol to biodiesel reduces its density and viscosity. When blended with biodiesel, the cetane number of the blends reduces, which causes deterioration of the self-ignition properties and a longer ignition delay [46] (see Fig. 11 ). In the combustion, initially, the evaporation and fuel–air mixture interaction are observed. It is followed by energy release at the main stage of uncontrolled combustion and then mixing controlled combustion occurs. Due to the decrease in fuel reactivity in the mixtures, the decrease in the mass of fuel-burning during the uncontrolled combustion phase decreases the heat release peaks. In the late combustion phase, heat release remained low. The high evaporation latent heat in alcohol decreased the values in the premixed combustion, and the peak points were moved away from the TDC. HRR values of ULSD and OC20 were quite similar. Pure biodiesel B100 resulted in the delayed heat release. PR20, BU20, and PE20 alcohol biodiesel blends have similar but slightly lower HRR curves. At 75% load, peak values of HRR for all test fuels were realized at around 366 CAD. The peak of the HRR value of diesel fuel was 69.15 J/o, and that of OC20 was 68 J/o. There is only a 1.6% drop in HRR of OC20 when compared to ULSD. The highest decrease was observed in PR20 with 14%. Due to the oxygen content of alcohol fuels, the combustion process has improved. Gas temperature is lower due to the lower heat release rate and higher latent evaporation heat. In the use of propanol, low cetane number and high evaporation heat increased the ignition delay [33,55,56,57]. Continuation of afterburning is observed in the mentioned part. This second peak is due to the continued heat release of after burning along with the ended fuel injection to the combustion chamber with that the heat absorption due to the evaporation of the fuel droplet is not occurred. However, minor fluctuations are considered likely to occur (Fig. 12 ). The change of MGT for fuel samples tested at different engine loads is given in Fig. 13 . MGT values for ULSD, OC20, and PE20 were almost identical. The value of the mean gas temperature for PR20 and BU20 was found lower. For the test fuels, peak values of mean gas temperature at 75% load were found at 382 CAD. For diesel fuel, the peak of MGT was 2545 K OC20, while it was 2500 K for OC20 alcohol-based fuels. There is only about 2% decrease in MGT of OC20 when compared to ULSD. The highest decrease was observed in BU20 with 14.6%. MGT can provide descriptive information about the development of combustion in the engine. MGT depends on the properties of the fuel (such as viscosity, density, cetane number, calorific value) and to the set values of operating conditions of the engine (injection pressure, injection timing, compression ratio [31]. When all alternative fuels are compared to diesel, slight decreases were detected in MGT. The reason for this decrease is that the burning temperature decreases due to the low heating value of alcohol and biodiesel and high latent evaporation heat [38]. It has been observed in many studies that the addition of alcohol causes a decrease in MGT [23,27]. The mass fraction burned in an engine is an essential indicator of the burning process. When determining the burning time from the MBF, it can be taken between 1 and 99%, considering the ignition delay (1.5–5%) [57]. The burning time was taken as 3–97% due to the sensitivity at the endpoints. The MBF of all the test fuels is quite similar. Ignition points tend to decrease in alcohol mixtures. Facilitating the ignition and increasing the speed of the flame developing in the cylinder are effective in the tendency to decrease (see Fig. 14 )."
6,Conclusions,"The effects of heavy alcohols, the propanol, butanol, pethanol, and octanol on the usability of safflower oil biodiesel have been experimentally investigated by blending 20% of these alcohols with the biodiesel. The performance, combustion and emission data derived from the alcohol blends were compared with pure biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel. The following conclusions were collected based on the results obtained from the experiments: • The addition of alcohol causes an increase in fuel consumption due to a decrease in lower thermal performance. The OC20 and ULSD values are very close. • Like MFC values, the change is valid within BSFC values. The difference between fuels decreased after average loads. Compared to OC20, there was a 4.7% increase for other alcohol mixtures. • The lowest energy values have ever been obtained for fuel PR20. The use of heavy alcohols in diesel engine in specific quantities by mixing with biodiesel significantly increases engine efficiency. • The lowest CO values have ever been obtained for OC20, compared to diesel, with an approximately 14% improvement in CO emissions. Other alcohol data are very close to OC20. • The lowest HC values have ever been obtained for OC20, while the highest values have ever been obtained for B100. Other alcohol data were very close to OC20, and the difference was about 12%. • NOx emissions are usually reduced when using alcohol as a mixture due to the low adiabatic flame temperature and higher latent heat of vaporization. • A reduction in CO2 for alcohol-based fuels results in excess oxygen content in alcohols and biodiesel and relatively low carbon content in their chemical chains. • Addition of alcohol reduced peak pressure values. Although the OC20 is partially reduced, it is close to ULSD. The high latent heat of vaporization in alcohol decreased the values in the pre-mixed combustion, and the peak points were removed from the TDC. • The HRR values for ULSD and OC20 were pretty similar. • Higher pre-evaporation temperatures and low-temperature combustion of alcohols led to lower MGT values. • The MBF values of all test fuels are quite similar."
