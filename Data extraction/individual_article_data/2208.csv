0,Introduction,"The urgent need to reduce the current energy dependence on fossil fuels has promoted a large number of studies that focus on the development of existing and new processes that use biomass based materials as feedstock. Biomass derived fuels and chemicals can play a major role in reducing CO2 emissions as well as become a strategic source in order to guarantee energy competitiveness and sustainability [1]. However, the establishment of a sustainable energy system should be based on biomass exploitation policies that take into account land usage in order to avoid competition with human and animal food and soil exhaustion [2]. Accordingly, lignocellulosic biomass wastes and crops are regarded as the most suitable alternative feedstocks [3]. Lignocellulosic biomass can be treated using several thermochemical or biochemical processes in order to produce energy, bio-fuels and bio-chemicals [4]. Thermochemical processes, such as gasification and pyrolysis, are characterized by their scalability to industrial units, where the syngas and bio-oil produced as intermediate products can be subsequently converted into valuable fuels and chemicals [5]. These processes have the advantage of being similar to the ones already implemented in oil refineries, although need further development in order to be cost effective compared to fossil fuels [6]. Fig. 1 displays the main processes involved in a lignocellulosic thermochemical bio-refinery for the production of valuable products such as automotive fuels, light olefins and H2. The global hydrogen production accounts for approximately 7.7 EJ/year, which may rise to 10 EJ/year by 2050 [7]. The main applications are related to ammonia production (51%), oil refining (31%), methanol production (10%), and other uses (8%) [7] (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, H2 market is expected to increase in the near future in a 5–10% per year, basically due to its consumption in refineries for treating heavy oil fractions and because of the projected demand in the transportation sector or as energy vector [8]. The 96% of the H2 production technologies are based on non-renewable sources, with the most used processes being natural gas (48%) and oil (30%) reforming, followed by coal gasification (18%) [9]. Only 4% of the H2 produced is obtained by means of water electrolysis [9] (Fig. 3 ). Consequently, in order to meet the fossil fuel consumption and CO2 release reduction targets, new sustainable processes derived from renewable sources must be developed, such as the thermochemical ones that use biomass as feedstock shown in Fig. 1. Although each biomass conversion method has its own advantages and disadvantages, it has been reported that the H2 production cost for gasification and pyrolysis is similar, around $1.2–2.4/kg (slightly higher for the former), which is actually between two and three times higher than the cost for CH4 steam reforming [10]. Therefore, the choice of the most adequate one needs a thorough assessment of the economic aspects in the area where it has to be implemented, as well as the availability of biomass resources, and the existence of large catalytic conversion units that can treat the intermediate products. These aspects allow making the choice between centralized processes, in which the final product is produced at the same unit where the biomass is primarily converted, or decentralized processes, in which the intermediate product (such as the bio-oil derived from flash pyrolysis) can be easily transported to catalytic conversion units. The mostly studied and developed technologies for H2 production are steam gasification [11–18] and the reforming of the bio-oil produced in biomass flash pyrolysis [19–25]; however, the biomass fast pyrolysis and in-line reforming of the volatiles has recently gained attention, with several studies published in the literature over the last years [26–31]. In this scenario, this one aims at reviewing the pyrolysis and in-line reforming strategy and comparing this technology with the main thermochemical biomass conversion processes for H2 production."
1,Biomass steam gasification,"Biomass gasification has been widely studied during last decades, which is due to the fact the gaseous product can be directly used as fuel or as an intermediate product for the large scale production of fuels and chemicals [32–36]. The process characteristics entail establishing gasification plants in the regions where biomass is available, because the costs for the transportation of the raw material or the formed gaseous products would be excessive [37]. Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of the steam gasification process. Biomass gasification typically takes place at temperatures between 700 and 1200 °C, using air, oxygen, steam or their mixtures as gasifying agent, which leads to a gaseous product mainly formed by H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons. The use of steam enhances H2 formation and produces a high heating value gas with no nitrogen. Although the highly endothermic nature of steam gasification increases energy costs compared to air gasification, it avoids the need for a costly oxygen separation process [10]. The main steps involved in biomass steam gasification are drying, pyrolysis, heterogeneous char gasification and homogeneous reactions undergone by pyrolysis volatiles, i.e., reforming, cracking and Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactions. These gasification steps have been summarized in Fig. 5 . In the drying process, the evaporation of the moisture contained in the biomass takes place, which is usually a fast step and occurs at low temperatures, with its influence on the overall gasification process being limited. In the pyrolysis process, biomass is thermally degraded to yield gases, condensable products and char. The liquid product or primary tar formed in biomass pyrolysis is a complex mixture of oxygenates made up of alcohols, furans, ketones, saccharides, acids, phenols and so on [38–40]. However, these compounds are in general of marked unstable nature, and under gasification conditions are rapidly cracked or reformed, or evolve towards more stable aromatic structures, such as secondary and tertiary tars [41,42]. The tar contained in the syngas is a serious problem for its valorisation, given that it is polymerized or condensed below 300 °C, and so may cause fouling, corrosion and blocking of pipes, heat exchangers and particle filters [15,43]. Therefore, the improvement of tar cracking performance is one of the greatest challenges in the gasifier design [44], with the increase in residence time being an objective usually pursued. However, total elimination of the most stable tertiary tars requires temperatures of around 1250 °C and residence times above 0.5 s [42]. The char formed in the pyrolysis step is gasified by steam gasification and Boudouard reactions. However, the rate of both reactions is low, even at typical gasification temperatures. Thus, char gasification represents the limiting step in biomass gasification and an adequate reactor design requires a suitable residence time in order to attain high char conversion efficiency [45–47]. Therefore, biomass steam gasification products are as follows: a gaseous fraction typically composed of 30–50 vol% of H2, 25–40 vol% of CO, 8–20 vol% of CO2 and 6–15 vol% of CH4; a heavier fraction (tar), which consists of a complex mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons; and a solid fraction derived from the biomass that has not been totally gasified. The yields and properties of these products are influenced by a number of factors, with the most important ones being reactor configuration (which determines the contact mode, and therefore mass and heat transfer rates), biomass initial characteristics, operating conditions (such as temperature and steam to biomass ratio), and the use of catalysts [10,36,48]. Table 1 shows a summary of several biomass steam gasification research papers, in which the effect of the aforementioned variables is studied. For the sake of clarity, studies using only steam as gasifying agent have been analyzed. The discussion of the results reported is detailed below."
2,Reactor configurations,"2.1 Reactor configurations Biomass gasification is an extensively studied process, with a relatively high technological development [76]. Therefore, a wide range of reactor configurations have been used, such as fixed bed (updraft and downdraft), fluidized bed, entrained flow, spouted beds, rotary kiln or plasma reactors [34–36,77–79]. The assessment of the effect of reactor configuration on the results shown is not straightforward, due to different scale, uneven biomass composition, operating conditions and gas and tar analysis procedures used. However, analyzing the non-catalytic gasification experiments carried out in updraft fixed bed [11], entrained flow [12,13], rotary kiln [14], plasma [54], free fall [55], fluidized bed [59,70] and spouted bed [57,80,81] reactors, and although all reactor configurations lead to H2 productions between 1.3 and 8.5 wt% (with the average value being 4.6 wt%), with tar concentrations in the 4–140 g/Nm3 range, it can be concluded that fluidized bed reactors are suitable for the biomass steam gasification process because high H2 productions (6.9 wt%), gas yields (around 1–1.4 Nm3/kgbiomass), H2 concentrations (>50 vol%) and low tar ones (20–80 g/Nm3) are obtained [59,70]. Furthermore, the scale up of this technology has been satisfactorily accomplished, solving the heat supply problems by means of the dual fluidized bed (DFB) configuration, which is a combination of two bubbling and/or circulating fluidized beds, with one of them acting as gasifier and the other as char combustor [82]. The gasifier is blown with steam, obtaining a syngas with high H2 content, whereas the char is burnt in the combustor in order to provide heat to the system [18,75,83,84]. However, it has been reported that the heat provided by char combustion may not be enough, and therefore additional fuel must be used in order to meet heat specifications [85]. The pioneering DFB biomass gasifier was developed by Dr. Kunni, in order to gasify municipal solid wastes [85]. Currently, the vast majority of the biomass steam gasification demonstration or commercial scale plants are based on this technology [86]. Thus, among the DFB gasification technologies reviewed by Göransson et al. [83], the ones that must be remarked due to their capacity are SilvaGas™ plant in USA (40 MWth), which consists of two circulating fluidized beds, 32 MWth GoBiGas plant in Sweden, 15 MWth Blue Tower plant in Germany, Güssing FICFB plant in Austria (8 MWth) and Charlmers plant in Sweden (2 MWth), the four based on a bubbling fluidized bed as gasifier and a circulating fluidized bed as combustor."
3,Effect of biomass characteristics,"2.2 Effect of biomass characteristics The main biomass characteristics affecting gasification performance are biomass type, moisture content and particle size [10]. Regarding biomass type, special attention has to be paid to the ash content as, on the one hand, high ash content biomasses lead to high char yields and, on the other, ash leaves the gasifier in the form of micron size particulate matter, which has to be removed downstream by means of gas cleaning processes [87]. Wei et al. [55] compared legume straw and pine sawdust gasification performance in a free fall reactor, with the former having a higher ash content. Although legume straw lead to a lower gas yield and higher char and tar ones than pinewood, the H2 content in the gas was higher, being 50 vol% for legume straw and 44 vol% for pinewood at 850 °C, which correspond to a H2 production of 5.2 and 4.5 wt%, respectively. Gasifiers can handle biomasses having moisture contents below 35 wt%, although most of them are designed for a 10–15 wt%. The main drawback of raw materials with high moisture contents lies in the loss of gasification efficiency due to the reduction of operation temperature [86]. Pfeifer et al. [69] observed for a moisture content in the original biomass between 6 and 40 wt% that H2 concentration in the gas increased as the moisture content was higher, although the differences were not considerable (from 34 vol% for a moisture content of 6 wt%, to 38 vol% for 40 wt%). The biomass particle size has a great influence on the gasification performance. Thus, smaller particles provide larger surface areas per unit mass, which increases heat and mass transfer, and therefore gasification rates, leading to high gas yields with high H2 concentrations and low tar contents [10,86]. However, reducing biomass particle size below 1 mm increases exponentially energy consumption [86]. Therefore, it is essential to develop a versatile gasification technology that may handle large biomass particles without compromising heat and mass transfer phenomena. Thus, particle size hardly affects gasification when the studies are carried out using reactor configurations with high heat transfer rates, such as the one performed by Michel et al. [60] in a bubbling fluidized bed by feeding wood pellets with a size between 6 and 8 mm and Erkiaga et al. [57] in a conical spouted bed with particles in the 0.75–4 mm size range. The latter configuration has been proven to be especially suitable for handling different types of residues without operational problems, such as plastics [88,89] and biomass/plastic mixtures [90]."
4,Operating conditions,"2.3 Operating conditions Gasifier temperature and steam to biomass (S/B) ratio are the parameters that need to be carefully selected and controlled for improving gasification performance [10,86]. Temperature has a great impact on gas and H2 yields, due to the endothermicity of the reactions involved (pyrolysis, steam reforming, Boudouard and char steam gasification reactions). Furthermore, an increase in temperature hinders the WGS reaction equilibrium. Overall, at higher temperatures a gaseous product with higher H2 and lower CO and CH4 concentrations is obtained, as well as a reduced tar content and char yield. 2.3.1 Temperature Most of the authors that studied the influence of temperature on product yields and compositions agreed that a more severe operation led to an improved gasification performance, minimizing the tar content, as shown in Fig. 6 . Thus, in the non-catalytic study performed by Wei et al. [55], the maximum H2 productions of 5.2 and 4.5 wt% were obtained at the highest temperature of 850 °C for legume straw and pinewood, respectively. At this temperature, tar content was minimized, with a reduction from 62.8 to 3.7 g/Nm3 for legume straw and from 45.6 to 6 g/Nm3 for pinewood, in the 750–850 °C temperature range. Erkiaga et al. [57] operating in a conical spouted bed reactor, concluded that gas yield and H2 concentration increased from 0.73 Nm3/kgbiomass and 28 vol% at 800 °C to 0.96 and 38 at 900 °C, respectively (which corresponds to an increase in the H2 production from 1.8 to 3.3 wt%). Similarly, the utilization of a catalyst in the gasification bed resulted in an analogous effect of temperature on gasification operation. Luo et al. [51] using dolomite as in bed catalyst in a fixed bed observed the maximum H2 production of 11.2 wt% at the highest temperature studied (900 °C), and no tar was detected under those conditions. Olivine also leads to a similar trend with temperature, with the best results being observed at the highest temperatures studied. Thus, Rapagná et al. [61] and Michel et al. [16], gasifying almond shells and miscanthus in a fluidized bed, attained the maximum gas yields of 1.9 and 1.2 Nm3/kgbiomass and H2 productions of 9.4 and 4.9 wt%, at 820 and 880 °C, respectively. Tar contents were also found to be minimum at the highest temperature with a value of 0.6 g/Nm3 for the study with almond shells [61]. Therefore, gasification temperature will be limited by the economics of the process because higher temperatures lead to higher H2 productions and a gas with lower tar content. 2.3.2 Steam to biomass ratio Steam to biomass ratio (S/B) also plays a crucial role in gas and H2 yields. As S/B is increased, the WGS reaction and steam reforming ones are favoured, thus leading to a higher gaseous yield, i.e., H2 and CO2 formation is promoted and the one of CO and hydrocarbons is reduced [53]. In addition, tar formation and char yield are hindered due to the enhancement of reforming and gasification reactions. However, the S/B ratio has to be optimized for each process because an excess of steam, on the one hand, does not entail an improvement in the quality of the product gas and, on the other hand, it considerably increases the energy consumption of the process [86]. Fig. 7 shows some of the studies in which the effect of steam to biomass ratio on H2 production has been studied. Umeki et al. [11], operating in an updraft fixed bed gasifier with a feed rate of 1.2 t/day, observed that H2 production passed through a maximum value of 6.4 wt% at S/B = 2.15. However, tar content increased from 50 g/Nm3 at S/B = 1.4 to 100 g/Nm3 at S/B = 2.7. In the experiments carried out by Iovane et al. [14] in a rotary gasifier with S/B ratios in the 0.6–1 range, it was concluded that gas yield was hardly affected by this parameter (remaining at a value of around 0.8 Nm3/kgbiomass), while the H2 produced increased from 2.9 to 3.7 wt% for S/B = 1. Gil et al. [59] and Göransson et al. [70], operating in a fluidized and dual fluidized bed, respectively, observed that the S/B ratio had a positive effect in both H2 concentration and tar content, with the optimum value being the highest one studied (1.1 for the former and 0.9 for the latter). Thus, the H2 concentration and tar contents at the selected operating conditions were 55 vol% and 38 g/Nm3 [59] and 51 vol% and 10 g/Nm3 [70]. In the studies where dolomite and olivine were used as in-bed catalyst, S/B ratio also had a positive effect on gasification performance. Thus, Luo et al. [51], operating in a free fall reactor at 900 °C, observed that even with the lowest S/B ratio of 0.73, tar was totally cracked and that the highest H2 production was obtained with a S/B ratio of 2.1 (11.2 wt%)."
5,Catalysts,"2.4 Catalysts The syngas that leaves the gasification reactor requires several complex and costly purification steps in order to meet specifications for the downstream catalytic conversion processes, which are designed for removing the particulate matter (micron size char and ash), the N, S and Cl containing gaseous compounds (such as NH3, HCN, H2S and HCl) and specially the tar components present in the gas [42,43,97–101]. Many strategies have been developed in order to obtain a tar free (or low tar content) syngas, and they can be classified into primary processes, which hinder tar formation in the gasifier, or secondary processes, which imply a cleaning of the produced syngas. Amongst the primary methods for tar elimination the design of the gasifier is usually the first measure adopted. This is the case of fluidized bed gasifiers whose flexible design allows for several modifications aimed at improving tar cracking efficiency, which are as follows: increase in residence time in the freeboard region [59], location of the feeding zone [102,103] or secondary air injections in the case of air gasification [104]. Catalytic gas cleaning methods for tar removal have the advantage of an additional increase in gas and H2 yields, due to the enhancement of tar cracking and steam reforming reactions. The most widely used catalysts in steam gasification studies are natural minerals, such as dolomite or olivine, and Ni based catalysts [105–108]. The former have the advantage of their availability and low cost, whereas Ni based catalysts have a high activity for tar cracking and reforming [109]. They can be used as primary catalysts, directly in the gasifier, or as secondary catalysts in downstream catalytic processes. Fig. 8 shows the tar contents obtained with different catalysts by several authors. 2.4.1 Primary catalysts Dolomite has been widely used as primary catalyst due to its performance and availability [41]. Thus, Wei et al. [55], tested in a free fall reactor the performance of different naturally occurring catalysts, such as limestone, olivine and dolomite, finding that dolomite was the one that led to the lowest tar yield, accounting for a tar content in the gas of 11.2 g/Nm3 for legume straw and 9.4 g/Nm3 for pinewood at 800 °C. However, dolomite undergoes a severe attrition, especially in fluidized beds, which has boosted the utilization of other catalysts with higher mechanical resistance. Olivine has gained attention as primary catalyst in fluidized or high solid circulation beds due to its high mechanical strength, together with its good tar cracking activity, as mentioned previously. Koppatz et al. [18] tested the performance of olivine as primary catalyst in a 20 kg/h dual fluidized bed reactor, observing that H2 production and gas yield were increased from 3.1 to 4.2 wt% and 0.99 to 1.13 Nm3/kgbiomass, respectively, when olivine was used instead of silica sand and that the tar content in the gas was reduced from 18.9 to 11 g/Nm3. Erkiaga et al. [15] compared the influence of olivine and γ-alumina addition in a conical spouted bed reactor, and observed that both catalysts were active for tar cracking, i.e., tar was reduced from 142 with sand to 30.1 and 22.4 g/Nm3 with olivine and γ-alumina, respectively. In order to improve the tar cracking activity of olivine, Rapagná et al. studied the effect of Fe [62] and Ni [60] addition in a fluidized bed. An addition of a 10 wt% of Fe increased H2 production from 3.5 to 6.6 wt% and gas yield from 1 to 1.4 Nm3/kgbiomass and reduced tar content from 3.6 to 1.4 g/Nm3, compared to olivine. Furthermore, these authors did not observed any coke deposition during the runs [62]. The addition of 3.9 wt% Ni to the olivine catalyst improved gas production, from 1 to 1.7 Nm3/kgbiomass and also H2 production, from 3.4 to 7.8 wt% at 800 °C, with olivine and Ni/olivine, respectively. Tar production was also reduced by three times, leading to a content of 5.9 g/Nm3 with the Ni/olivine catalyst [60]. 2.4.2 Secondary catalysts Regarding secondary gas treatments, Delgado et al. [65] corroborated that Ni based catalysts are more active for tar elimination than natural minerals. Thus, in the experiments performed in a fluidized bed gasifier followed by a fixed bed downstream reactor, although both the dolomite and the commercial Ni catalyst used reduced tar content from 9 g/Nm3 to less than 0.5 g/Nm3, the Ni based catalyst required a lower operation temperature (740 vs. 800 °C), and lead to a higher gas yield (2.3 vs. 1.8 Nm3/kgbiomass) and H2/CO ratio (2.55 vs. 2.2) than dolomite. Rapagná et al. [66] also compared dolomite and Ni based catalyst for tar removal in a similar reactor configuration, concluding that the latter was more active because it lead to an increase in gas yield from 1 to 1.98 Nm3/kgbiomass and reduction in tar content from 100 to 0.2 g/Nm3, obtaining a H2 production of 11 wt% at 830 °C. However, a slight deactivation caused by coke deposition was observed after 2 h of operation. Accordingly, efforts are being directed to the development of active and coke resistant Ni based catalysts. As observed in Table 1, most of the secondary catalysts are based on Ni as active phase, Al2O3 as support and a promoter such as Mg, Ca, K or La. Pfeifer and Hofbauer [75] operated in a dual fluidized bed and secondary downstream fixed bed reactor using 16–40 wt% NiO/Al2O3 monolithic catalysts, doped with MgO or K2O. Tar content decreased from 8.5 to 0.02 g/Nm3 with the highest Ni loading in the catalyst, and a gas with a H2 content of 45 vol% was produced at 900 °C. Regarding catalyst deactivation, a temperature increase from 850 to 900 °C reduced coke content by 25%. The catalytic tar elimination performance of these catalysts can be further enhanced by the utilization of a primary catalyst in the gasifier bed. For example, Di Carlo et al. [17] gasified hazelnut shell in a fluidized bed of olivine particles and reformed the produced gas in a fixed bed made of a Ni-mayenite (Ca12Al14O33) catalyst. The gas leaving the gasifier had an approximate tar content of 26 g/Nm3, and the secondary treatment reduced this content in an 84% at 800 °C, increasing H2 concentration in the gas from 48 vol% to 55 vol%. The authors observed no catalyst deactivation under these conditions for 12 h operation. Finally, although the majority of the secondary catalytic treatment processes have been carried out in a fixed bed reactor, Bain et al. [67] and Yung et al. [68] studied the secondary tar cracking and reforming step in a fluidized bed, which was placed downstream a fluidized bed gasifier, followed by a thermal cracking tubular reactor. Operation in a fluidized bed reactor implies developing fluidizable Ni based catalysts, with high attrition resistance. Yung et al. [68] used olivine as primary catalyst in the gasifier and developed a fluidizable 6.6%NiO/3.4%MgO/4.0%K2O/Al2O3 reforming catalyst for the reforming step. H2 concentration in the gas increased from 32.8 vol% for gasification to 53.7 vol% including the reforming step, whereas the tar, whose content was 13.5 g/Nm3 without the reforming step, practically disappeared. The authors performed 10 reaction-regeneration cycles, in which H2 concentration was reduced to 52.4 vol%, and although the catalyst was still active for tar reforming, CH4 concentration increased from 0.17 to 2.7 vol%, which was attributed to H2S deactivation."
6,Supercritical water gasification,"Supercritical water gasification has been proposed as alternative to steam gasification for high moisture content biomass (typically >30 wt%), such as food derivatives [111], algae [112] or sewage sludge, as no drying pretreatment is required [113]. The process takes place at temperatures higher than 374 °C and pressures above 22.1 MPa [114,115], with H2 production being enhanced at temperatures above 600 °C (lower ones have been reported to increase CH4 concentration). However, the process presents serious drawbacks for large scale feasibility. Pumping of the feedstock is a technological challenge, as biomass needs to be converted into a pumpable slurry or solution, which limits the dry biomass content in the slurry to 20 wt%, depending on the biomass type. In addition, plugging by char, tar or alkaline catalysts may occur in long time runs and the severe operating conditions may lead to material corrosion problems [116]. The high energy consumption of the process is one of the most important factors, as water has to be maintained at supercritical conditions. These drawbacks have hindered the scalability of the process, and therefore laboratory scale reactors have been used for biomass supercritical gasification studies, with most of the runs being carried out in batch reactors [117–125] and, to a lesser extent, in continuous flow tubular [126,127] or fluidized bed reactors [128]. The largest supercritical water gasification facility implemented is the VERENA pilot plant at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (100 kg/h), which has been designed for 700 °C, 35 MPa and a maximum solids content of 20 wt%, and includes a down-flow reactor and a biomass and water preheating step with the reactor outlet stream [113,129]. In order to reduce the operating temperature and increase H2 selectivity, several catalysts have been developed, which can be classified into alkali based (such as Na2CO3, K2CO3 or NaOH), transition metal based (Ni and Ru) and activated carbon catalysts. Although all of them have proven to be suitable for enhancing gasification and improving H2 yield, alkali catalysts lead to corrosion and plugging problems, whereas transition metal and activated carbon based catalysts undergo a severe deactivation [115,130]. Several studies have been carried out analyzing the supercritical gasification of food and agricultural residues, in which the H2 productions reported vary in a wide range, between 0.1 and 11 wt% (defined as gH2/100 gbiomass) which depend on the biomass type and loading, operating conditions and catalysts used. Thus, in the non-catalytic supercritical gasification studies carried out in batch reactors in which the influence of biomass type was analyzed, Safari et al. [117] observed that biomasses with a high cellulose content and low lignin one lead to higher H2 productions, with the maximum value of 1.5 wt% being obtained for wheat straw at 440 °C and 25 MPa, with a biomass loading of 1 wt% in a batch micro reactor system. However, Yanik et al. [118] concluded that other organic materials apart from cellulose and lignin are responsible for the differences in gasification yields. The H2 production values reported by these authors in a batch autoclave at 500 °C ranged between 0.4 and 0.9 wt%. Regarding the influence of catalyst on gasification performance, the studies performed reveal that although alkali, transition metal and activated carbon based catalysts improve H2 production, there is no consensus regarding which type of catalyst is the most adequate one. Ding et al. [122] compared the performance of Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, KOH and calcined dolomite, and concluded that KOH had the best activity in pinewood supercritical gasification, with H2 production being increased from 0.2 to 1.1 wt% at 550 °C. Contrarily, Jin et al. [123] compared the catalytic behaviour of Ca(OH)2, Na2CO3, K2CO3, NaOH, KOH, LiOH, and ZnCl2, three kinds of Raney-Ni, dolomite, and olivine, in peanut shell gasification at 400 °C and 24 MPa, observing that the Raney-Ni catalyst with the highest Fe content was the most active one, obtaining a H2 production of 2.1 wt%. Furthermore, Ru based catalysts have also proven to have a high activity, as confirmed by Elif and Nezihe [124], who improved H2 production from 3.2 to 11 wt% in the gasification of pulp fruit at 600 °C, using a Ru/C catalyst, and by Osada et al. [125], who also found that H2 production was enhanced, from 0.1 to 1 wt%, when a Ru/TiO2 catalyst was used in sugarcane bagasse gasification at 400 °C."
7,Bio-oil reforming,"Bio-oil is the liquid fraction obtained from biomass pyrolysis, which is the thermal decomposition of biomass in absence of oxygen, and one of the most energetically efficient and low cost process to obtain liquid fuels from a renewable source [131–133]. Thus, under fast pyrolysis conditions (high heating rates and short residence times), bio-oil yields between 60 and 75 wt% are achieved [38,134–137], which can be valorised by the catalytic steam reforming process to produce H2 as main product. Although bio-oil properties change depending on pyrolysis conditions, reactor configuration and the feedstock used, its direct application involves several drawbacks related to its high viscosity, low heating value, high oxygen and water content and high corrosiveness, which make it chemically unstable and cause ageing problems in its storage [136]. In spite of the disadvantages of the bio-oil compared to a conventional fuel, it is a good alternative for H2 production from a renewable source [106,138–140]. Thus, the aforementioned problems lead to consider different alternatives for its upgrading, such as mix it with other fuels or physical, thermal and catalytic treatments (catalytic cracking, esterification, hydrodeoxygenation, steam reforming, etc.) [136,138,140]. The catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil (Fig. 9 ) is one of these routes that has been considerably researched, using different reactor configurations, catalysts and operating conditions. The high water content of the bio-oil is not a problem for this valorisation route. The aforementioned difficulties related to bio-oil properties and its feeding problems boosted the use of bio-oil model compounds as feed, which helps understanding the mechanisms of reforming reactions [141], with acetic acid [142–158], acetone [159–166] and ethanol [167–170] being among others the most studied ones. Nevertheless, although some works have been published concerning reforming of phenols [150,151,165,166,171–173], and especially m-cresol [174–179], furans [176,177,180], saccharides [162,174] and aromatic compounds, such as toluene [181–183] or m-xylene [162], cyclic oxygenated compounds (phenols, saccharides and furans) are less investigated, but they are supposed to be responsible for the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition [180]. Consequently, this strategy focuses on the valorisation of the bio-oil aqueous fraction and, especially, raw bio-oil, which has recently gained increasing attention. Therefore, Tables 2 and 3 summarize some of these studies, in which reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction (Table 2) and raw bio-oil (Table 3) have been performed. Although different reactors and operating conditions have been used, a discussion of the main results has been detailed below. In this section, the values of H2 production are generally given as g of H2 per 100 g of organic compounds in the feed, and otherwise it will be specified in each case. Moreover, H2 yield is based on the maximum allowable by stoichiometry."
8,Reactor configurations,"4.1 Reactor configurations Many studies on the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction are found in the literature, which have been carried out mainly in fixed [23,24,184,186,188–191,196,210] and fluidized bed [21,185,187] reactors. Similarly to the reforming of the bio-oil aqueous fraction, the reforming of raw bio-oil has also been performed mainly in fixed bed [25,161,198,200,203–207,210] and fluidized bed [197,202,208] reactors. Higher conversion and H2 yield were obtained by Remón et al. [209] in a fixed bed reactor compared to fluidized bed reactor. Nevertheless, Lan et al. [201] reported lower carbon deposition in the fluidized bed reactor than in the fixed bed reactor, obtaining carbon contents of around 2.3 wt% and 0.3 wt%, respectively, at 650 °C in 60 min on stream. Moreover, some authors used a two-stage system for bio-oil reforming. The steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction [192,194,213], raw bio-oil [22,211,212] and bio-oil/bio-ethanol mixtures [214,215] was investigated by Remiro et al. and Valle et al. using a two-stage thermal-catalytic process, in which the pyrolytic lignin was deposited by repolymerization of certain bio-oil components in the first stage and the treated bio-oil together with the gases formed in the first step were in-line reformed in a fluidized bed reactor. Yao et al. [195] used a two-stage fixed bed reactor, where firstly the bio-oil aqueous fraction was volatilized at 400 °C and subsequently the reforming step was carried out on modified Ni-Al catalysts. Nevertheless, although different reactors have been used for bio-oil reforming, the main issue to be solved is related to raw bio-oil feeding, which causes several problems in the reforming reactions. Basagiannis et al. [186] reported coke deposition on the reactor wall due to the polymerization of unstable compounds in the bio-oil. Although the feeding system was cooled, Kechagiopoulos et al. [20] reported plugging of the injection nozzle, due to the thermal instability of the aqueous fraction of the bio-oil used for the process, which required a new injection-cooling system to feed adequately the bio-oil fraction. Moreover, some authors reported aging problems of the bio-oil, which have been solved by adding different alcohols such as methanol [197] or ethanol [215] in order to stabilize the bio-oil and reduce its viscosity."
9,Operating variables,"4.2 Operating variables In spite of the fact that a detailed comparison of results is difficult, the most relevant ones on the effect operating conditions have on product yields and, especially, on H2 production, have been summarized in this section. 4.2.1 Temperature Temperature is one of the key variables that should be taken into account in the reforming processes. On the one hand, higher temperatures enhance reforming kinetics of oxygenated compounds of the bio-oil and, therefore, higher H2 yield and production are obtained. On the other hand, using high temperatures the coke deposition can be reduced given that its in situ gasification is promoted [192,199,201,216]. Fig. 10 displays the effect of temperature on H2 yield in several bio-oil reforming processes studied in the literature. The effect of this variable on conversion and product distribution and, especially, on H2 production has been extensively studied in the literature in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction. Thus, Czernik et al. [185] reported that coke gasification was enhanced at 850 °C, obtaining a maximum conversion and H2 yield of 95% and 89%, respectively, with 1000 h−1 and S/C of 7, which corresponds to a H2 production of 16.8 wt%. Yan et al. [188] reported a very low H2 yield at 450 °C (9.4%), whereas a maximum H2 yield of 69.7% was attained at the highest temperature studied (800 °C), with water to bio-oil ratio being 4.9 and with Ni and Ce contents 12 and 7.5%, respectively. The effect of temperature in the 600–800 °C range was also studied by Bimbela et al. [190], obtaining higher conversion and H2 yield and production as temperature was increased, with the maximum values being 82.62%, 77% and 13.8 wt%, respectively. Nevertheless, the highest H2 concentration was obtained at 650 °C (65.48 vol%), which decreased to 56.87 vol% at 800 °C. Yao et al. [195] studied the influence of temperature in the 600–900 °C range, with conversion and H2 yield being increased from 8.11 to 90.40% and from 5.64 to 57.21%, respectively (maximum H2 production of 10.4 wt%). Therefore, most studies reveal that high temperatures are needed to achieve full conversion of bio-oil aqueous fraction. Nevertheless, Remiro et al. [192] reported full conversion above 550 °C, although catalyst deactivation was lower as temperature was increased in the 500–650 °C range. Concerning raw bio-oil reforming, similar effect of temperature on conversion and product distribution has been reported in the literature, with both increasing at higher reforming temperatures [203,204,207]. Thus, Wang et al. [198] reported higher carbon conversion and H2 yield as temperature was increased in the 250–750 °C range, obtaining a maximum conversion, H2 yield and H2 production of 96%, 80% and 20.1 wt%, respectively, at 750 °C and S/C ratio of 9 when C12A7-O−/18% Mg catalyst was used. As temperature was increased in the 400–550 °C range by Hou et al. [200], higher conversion and H2 yield and production were achieved, obtaining maximum values of 94.9%, 92.5% and 17.5 wt%, respectively, at 550 °C with the highest S/C ratio studied on a 15% Ni-CNT catalyst. Valle et al. [211] obtained a H2 yield of around 88% above 650 °C, 0.10 gcatalyst h gbio-oil −1 and S/C ratio of 6. 4.2.2 Space time Space time is an important variable whose effect has been studied by several authors in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction. Most studies reported that higher space times enhance reforming and WGS reactions, and therefore higher H2 yields are obtained. Thus, Medrano et al. [21] studied two different space time values (4.11 and 8.97 gcat min gorganics −1) in the steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction at 650 °C on a Mg modified Ni-Al catalyst, obtaining a significant increase in conversion and H2 concentration from 81.01% to 83.26% and from 63.13 vol% to 67.37 vol%, respectively, and achieving a maximum H2 production of 13.3 wt%. Liu et al. [191] studied the effect of space velocity at 750 °C and S/C ratio of 16, obtaining the highest values of conversion (98%) and H2 yield (62.5%) below 1.8 h−1. Similar results were obtained in the literature when raw bio-oil reforming was carried out, obtaining higher H2 yields as space velocity is decreased [22,25,204,207,208]. Wu et al. [199] reported that lower GHSV values lead to higher CH4 conversion and H2 yield, obtaining full conversion and a H2 yield of 81.1% at 800 °C and with a GHSV value lower than 3600 h−1. Remiro et al. [22] reported higher conversion and H2 yield when space velocity was decreased, obtaining full conversion and H2 yield of 95% at a S/C ratio of 9 and for GC1HSV lower than 65,000 h−1. Moreover, as space velocity was decreased lower coke content on the catalyst was observed, which decreases from 1.14 to 0.1 wt% in the 156,000–8000 h−1 range. Nevertheless, when low space velocity values are used, higher performance of the WGS reaction is observed, given that CO concentration decreases and CO2 concentration increases, at the same time as secondary products such as CH4 and light hydrocarbons produced from mainly cracking reactions disappear [21,186,190]. 4.2.3 Steam/C ratio The most important effect of S/C ratio is the enhancement of the WGS reaction, which favours the formation of H2 and CO2 as main products. Thus, most studies reported that CO, CH4 and light hydrocarbon yields are decreased as S/C ratio is increased [22,187,188,198,208]. Fig. 11 shows the effect of steam to C ratio on H2 yield in several bio-oil reforming studies. When S/C ratio was increased from 2 to 5 by Li et al. [187] in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction, H2 yield was significantly affected, although above this value the influence of S/C ratio was less pronounced. Ortiz-Toral et al. [189] reported that for S/C > 8 the effect of this variable on H2 production was negligible. Liu et al. [191] reported that for S/C ratios above 12, the yields become constant, obtaining a H2 yield of 61% with the highest S/C ratio, at 750 °C and 1.8 h−1. Similarly, studies related to raw bio-oil reforming also report higher H2 yields and carbon conversions when higher S/C ratios were used [202]. Thus, Wang et al. [198] observed the enhancement of the WGS reaction as S/C ratio was increased in the 1.5–9 range, especially between 1.5 and 4, with the increase being smaller in the 4–9 range. Lan et al. [201] reported the enhancement of reforming and WGS reactions at high S/C values in both fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors, although the steam needed in the fluidized bed reactor was higher because it acted also as a fluidizing agent. Remiro et al. [22] reported higher H2 yields as S/C ratio was increased in the 1–15 range, although above S/C of 5 the increase was less significant, obtaining a maximum H2 yield of 95% at the highest S/C ratio studied. Moreover, at high S/C ratios water adsorption on the catalyst surface is enhanced, favouring the gasification of coke, and therefore improving the overall reforming process [184,198,207]. Thus, when S/C ratio was increased by Li et al. [187], lower coke yield was obtained, with the decrease being more pronounced from 2 to 5."
10,Catalysts,"4.3 Catalysts Different catalysts have been studied in the literature in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction and raw bio-oil, although Ni based are the most used ones [106,139,216,217]. Czernik et al. [197] compared a commercial (C11-NK) and laboratory prepared catalysts in the reforming of raw bio-oil and reported higher stability of the commercial catalyst due to the higher Ni content and surface area of that catalyst. Furthermore, it has high initial conversion (95%) and H2 production (12.9 wt% by mass unit of bio-oil). Nevertheless, some authors also used noble metals, which are very active for reforming reactions, although its high cost is a drawback for its industrial implementation. Thus, Rioche et al. [161] studied Rh and Pt catalysts supported on Al2O3 and CeZrO2 in the reforming of raw bio-oil, obtaining a maximum H2 yield of 75% using 1% Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst, with these values being noticeably higher compared to Al2O3 supported catalysts. Furthermore, different promoters have also been studied in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction in order to improve catalyst activity and stability, with Ce, La, Mg and Ca being the most studied ones. The effect of La2O3 addition to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was studied by Valle et al. [194] and a good performance was reported, which was explained by its capacity for water adsorption, and therefore for enhancing the WGS reaction. Moreover, higher stability of the catalyst was also observed when La2O3 was added, maintaining almost full conversion for up to 20 h on stream, whereas it decreased subsequent to 7 h when the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was used. Different Ni-Al catalysts modified with Ca, Ce, Mg, Mn and Zn were used by Yao et al. [195] in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction at 800 °C and a S/C ratio of 3.54. The highest H2 yield of 56.46% was obtained when Ni-Mg-Al catalyst was used, followed by Ni-Ce-Al (55.30%) and Ni-Zn-Al (52.01%) catalysts. Similarly, the addition of promoters has also been investigated in bio-oil reforming. Salehi et al. [203] compared Ru-Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with different Ni contents, obtaining a maximum H2 yield of 85% at 950 °C when Ru-Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was used with a Ni content higher than 10.7%. The effect of metal content on the catalyst has also been analyzed in the literature for the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction. Yan et al. [188] studied different Ni (between 5 and 12 wt%) and Ce (between 5 and 10 wt%) loadings in Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts and they did not observe high differences between the different loadings, although a little increase in H2 yield was achieved at the highest Ni loading studied. Bimbela et al. [190] investigated the effect of Ni content in the 23–33% range on product distribution and the highest conversion (63.35%) and H2 concentration (65.48 vol%) were obtained with the 28% Ni catalyst at 650 °C and 1.67 gcatalyst min gorganic −1. Concerning raw bio-oil reforming, the influence of Ni content on a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was studied by Seyedeyn-Azad et al. [204], obtaining the highest conversion (79%) and H2 yield (73%) when a Ni content of 14.1% was used. The same authors reported the effect of the support by comparing Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, achieving higher H2 yields when the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst with 14% Ni was used [206]. Nevertheless, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was much higher when the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst was used than when the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was used. The effect of Ni and Co content on a NiCo/Ce-Zr-O catalyst was studied by Zhang et al. [205] in the 2–10% range for both metals, obtaining the best results in terms of H2 yield (72.15%), H2 production (13.2 wt%) and coke deposition with 3Ni9Co/Ce-Zr-O catalyst. Moreover, increasing attention is being paid to the use of CO2 adsorbents in reforming processes, given that the thermodynamic equilibrium of bio-oil reforming reaction is shifted, and therefore higher H2 yields are obtained [22,165,213,218,219]. Thus, Remiro et al. [213] used dolomite as CO2 adsorbent in the catalytic steam reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction, obtaining full conversion of the bio-oil and H2 yields around 99%. Nevertheless, further studies dealing with reaction/regeneration cycles are required in order to study the loss of activity of the adsorbents."
11,Catalyst deactivation,"4.4 Catalyst deactivation Some authors reported high deactivation of the catalyst due to coke deposition on its surface. Catalyst deactivation leads to secondary reactions, such as thermal decomposition of bio-oil and Boudouard reactions. Although it has not been extensively studied in the literature, some authors reported that H2 and CO2 yields decrease and CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons yields increase with time on stream due to the attenuation of oxygenated compound reforming and the enhancement of secondary reactions in the reforming of bio-oil aqueous fraction [21,185,191,192]. Moreover, coke deposition may also be attributed to the dehydration and polymerization of the aromatic compounds in the bio-oil [220]. This trend on product yields was observed by Garcia et al. [184], obtaining by-products, such as CH4, methanol, benzene, toluene and naphthalene as the catalyst was deactivating. Czernik et al. [185] reported a conversion of around 100% of the bio-oil aqueous fraction and an initial H2 yield of 85%, although it decreased to 77% after 12 h on stream due to coke deposition. Bimbela et al. [190] reported a decreasing trend of conversion with time on stream due to the low activity of the catalyst for WGS reaction, at the same time as H2 production decreases and those of CO, CH4 and C2 increase. Nevertheless, at the highest space time studied, H2 yield was maintained constant for up to 120 min on stream. Moreover, Valle et al. [194] reported higher stability (conversion constant for up to 5 h on stream) and lower coke deposition with Ni-La2O3/αAl2O3 catalyst than with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, obtaining a coke content of 1.40 and 2.50 wt% at 600 °C and 0 and 0.10 wt% at 800 °C, respectively. The same trend was observed when raw bio-oil was valorised by catalytic steam reforming [22,198]. Thus, Rioche et al. [161] performed a long experiment with 1% Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst, obtaining a slow deactivation of the catalyst after 9 h on stream, with H2 yield being between 50 and 60%. Hou et al. [200] studied the stability of a 15% Ni-CNT catalyst at 500 °C, GHSV of 12,000 h−1 and S/C ratio of 6.1, registering a slow decrease on carbon conversion and H2 yield for the first 8 h on stream, whereas above that time H2 yield decreased considerably (50% lower) until 15 h on stream. Zhang et al. [205] studied the stability of 3Ni9Co/Ce-Zr-O catalyst, obtaining a decrease of 12% in H2 yield in 360 min on stream and a value of around 64% when the catalyst was deactivated. Fu et al. [207] reported slow deactivation of the Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst up to 6 h on stream at 850 °C, S/C ratio of 6 and WBHSV of 12 h−1, whereas the deactivation was faster subsequent to 6 h until a low H2 yield was obtained in 10 h on stream."
12,Bio-oil steam gasification,"Bio-oil gasification has been proposed as an alternative to biomass gasification for syngas production, with the aim of reducing the expensive biomass transport costs [221]. Therefore, as in the case of bio-oil reforming, several decentralized pyrolysis plants coupled with a centralized bio-oil gasification facility would be required in order to take advantage of the economies of scale [222]. In addition, the pyrolysis char may also be upgraded together with the bio-oil, by feeding it as bio-slurry, thus taking advantage of the potential of biomass pyrolysis char to produce H2 [223,224]. In this way, the biomass that has an energy density of about 2 GJ/m3 is upgraded to a bio-slurry with a density of 25 GJ/m3, thereby considerably reducing the transport costs [36]. It has been reported that bio-oil gasification becomes more attractive economically than biomass gasification for large scale plants, low energy density biomass and very long transport distances. However, improvements in biomass pyrolysis efficiency and gasification plants’ capital costs would make bio-oil gasification cost-competitive also in smaller distances [225]. The differences between bio-oil gasification and reforming are vague and sometimes are not well distinguished in the literature. In this paper, gasification has been considered as the process that takes place at higher temperatures than bio-oil reforming (around 800–1400 °C), and is carried out non-catalytically or in the presence of primary mineral catalysts, as in biomass gasification. Therefore, bio-oil gasification produces a syngas with a similar composition than the one obtained in biomass gasification, whereas bio-oil reforming yields a gas with higher H2 content. The lower H2 yield and energy efficiency and higher costs of bio-oil gasification are responsible for the lower technological development of this thermochemical route [226]. The H2 productions (defined in this section as gH2/100 gbio-oil) obtained by several authors in the literature vary in a wide range, as a result of differences in the bio-oils used, reactor configurations and operating conditions. In the non-catalytic studies analyzed, the average H2 production can be established at around 4 wt%, although values between 1.4 and 12.6 wt% have been reported. Thus, Panigrahi et al. [227], operating in a fixed bed micro-reactor at 800 °C, obtained the maximum H2 production of 4.4 wt% with a steam/carbon ratio of 2. A similar value of 4 wt% was attained by Kan et al. [228], also in a fixed bed at 800 °C and a S/C of 10.6. Furthermore, Latifi et al. [229], operating in a Jiggle bed reactor at 800 °C, without adding additional steam to the bio-oil, observed a H2 production of 3.5 wt%. Van Rossum et al. [230] obtained a lower H2 production of 1.4 wt% in a fluidized bed at 790 °C and S/C of 1.9. Finally, Chhiti et al. [231] reached the highest H2 production of 12.6 wt% at 1400 °C and S/C = 8.3 in a laboratory scale high temperature entrained flow reactor."
13,Pyrolysis and in-line steam reforming,"Among the different thermochemical routes aforementioned for H2 production from biomass, the two-stage pyrolysis-reforming strategy has been gaining increasing attention recently, given that it has several advantages in relation to the gasification process due to the separation of pyrolysis and reforming steps in different zones. Thus, this process allows for independent temperature optimization in the pyrolysis and reforming steps [232]. Moreover, compared to catalytic gasification process, the direct contact between the feedstock and its impurities with the reforming catalyst is avoided [233]. In addition, the reforming step is carried out at lower temperature in comparison to catalytic gasification, and therefore catalyst deactivation by sintering can be avoided [234,235], especially when Ni is used as active phase, which is the most widely used catalyst in reforming of oxygenated compounds and hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the gasification process does not focus on H2 production, but syngas is the main product. The quality and concentration of the syngas depends on the gasifying agent used, and therefore subsequent catalytic processes are needed to enhance H2 production. Moreover, highly active steam reforming catalysts allow for attaining complete conversion of biomass derived volatiles, with the gas product being free of tars, which is a remarkable advantage over conventional gasification [31]. Regarding bio-oil reforming, volatiles from biomass are valorised in-line, and therefore condensation and volatilization of the intermediate compounds from biomass pyrolysis are not required, which avoids the difficult handling of these products in addition to possible mass loss and re-polymerization during the raw bio-oil volatilization step. Moreover, the main advantage of the pyrolysis-reforming process lies in its ease scaling up with continuous feed. Fig. 12 shows a schematic representation of the two-step pyrolysis-reforming process. Although the routes described in previous sections such as direct gasification or bio-oil reforming have been extensively studied in the literature, the operating problems reported by some authors in these processes [201,236] have made the two-step process an interesting alternative for H2 production from biomass. Therefore, the following section focuses on an in-depth review on this process, in which the most relevant factors affecting product distribution will be discussed. Among others, the type of the reactor for both pyrolysis and reforming steps and their configuration plays an essential role for the process. Therefore, a comparison of the most relevant results in the literature using different feeds, catalyst and operating conditions for the two-stage pyrolysis-reforming process is summarized in Table 4 . The results have been arranged according to the reactor configuration used in each study."
14,Reactor configurations,"6.1 Reactor configurations The main reactors used in the literature for biomass pyrolysis are bubbling fluid beds, circulating fluid beds and transporter beds, rotating cone, ablative reactor, vacuum reactor, screw kiln reactor and spouted bed reactor [134]. The kind of pyrolysis reactor and its features are relevant factors for this process, given that they condition the distribution of pyrolysis products and their yields. Thus, bubbling fluidized bed reactors are the most developed technology, using sand as fluidizing solid because it allows an excellent gas-solid contact, and therefore improves heat transfer [134]. Moreover, it should be taken into account that the product stream of the pyrolysis step is the feed of the subsequent reforming step, which is usually carried out in fixed or fluidized bed reactors. Although the use of fixed bed reactors is more extended, fluidized bed reactors avoid operational problems related to bed blockage by coke deposition in the reforming step [201,236]. Thus, Fig. 13 shows the different reactor configurations studied in the literature for this two-step process. The group headed by Prof. Williams carries out the process in discontinuous mode, using a two stage fixed bed reactor (Fig. 13a), in which the biomass is pyrolyzed in the first stage and the volatiles from the pyrolysis circulate through the catalytic reforming step, with wood sawdust and pellets being the feedstock used for most of the studies [26,27,239,240], although other materials, such as cellulose [241], rice husk, sugar cane bagasse and wheat straw [242] or biomass/plastic mixtures [251,252] have also been investigated. This two-stage fixed bed reactor strategy has also been used by other authors for the pyrolysis-reforming of different materials, such as pine wood chip, pig manure compost, sewage sludge [28,243], cedar wood [253], bagasse [254] and corncob [246–248]. The process developed by the research group headed by Prof. Yoshikawa consists also in a two-step pyrolysis-reforming reactor, in which pyrolysis and reforming zones are also separate [244,245,255]. Although most studies in the literature are carried out in laboratory-scale batch reactors, Xiao et al. [249] worked in a two stage fluidized-fixed bed configuration with continuous biomass in the feed, with the pyrolysis step being carried out in a fluidized bed reactor of silica sand and the reforming step in a fixed bed reactor on a commercial Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/BCC (brown coal char) bed (Fig. 13b). Wang et al. [256] used a similar configuration, in which continuous pyrolysis of cellulose was carried out at the lower section of the reactor (fluidized bed) and the upper section is the reactor for the catalytic reforming step (fixed bed). Koike et al. [29] and Li et al. [257,258] studied the pyrolysis-reforming process in a continuous feed laboratory scale dual-bed reactor, which includes a primary bed for biomass pyrolysis and a secondary catalyst bed for the reforming of pyrolysis products. A different reactor configuration was used by Efika et al. [250], which was provided by a screw-kiln reactor for the continuous biomass pyrolysis and a fixed bed reactor for the reforming of pyrolysis vapours (Fig. 13c). Ma et al. [30] improved this two step process introducing another stage between the pyrolysis and reforming reactors for gas-solid simultaneous gasification (Fig. 13d). A different reactor configuration has been used by Arregi et al. [31,259] for the pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming of biomass, in which a spouted bed reactor was used for the pyrolysis step and the volatile stream leaving this reactor was introduced in a fluidized bed reforming reactor (Fig. 13e). The use of this configuration has been successfully applied to the valorisation of plastics [234,236,260,261] and biomass/plastic mixtures [262]. Moreover, this technology has many possibilities for industrial implementation due to the suitability of the spouted bed for the pyrolysis step [263–269]. In fact, this reactor has been satisfactorily scaled up for continuous pyrolysis of 25 kg h−1 of biomass [270,271]. The advantages of the conical spouted bed reactor in relation to other pyrolysis technologies has been discussed elsewhere [272]. Thus, some of the technologies currently used for the pyrolysis-reforming process have some issues to resolve due to the discontinuous mode of the process. Nevertheless, as described above, great progress has been made recently, especially for the implementation of continuous biomass feed integrated into different kinds of reactors and configurations, with all these improvements contributing to the successful scaling up of the process."
15,Operating variables,"6.2 Operating variables The operating conditions play a vital role in pyrolysis and in-line reforming of biomass. In this section, the effect of the most significant operating variables on H2 production (defined as g of H2 per 100 g of biomass) will be discussed, i.e., reforming temperature, reforming space time and steam/carbon (S/C) ratio. 6.2.1 Reforming temperature The product yields obtained in the reforming step depend especially on the reforming temperature, given that steam reforming of the oxygenated compounds and hydrocarbons (CH4 and light hydrocarbons) produced from biomass pyrolysis are endothermic reactions, and they are therefore favoured at high temperatures. Nevertheless, the WGS reaction is an exothermic reaction which is enhanced at low temperatures, and therefore the optimum reforming temperature to enhance H2 production should be found. Consequently, most studies reveal that high reforming temperatures enhance steam reforming reactions and lead to high conversion or gas yield and low tar yields [249,258], at the same time as H2 production is also enhanced (Fig. 14 ). Xiao et al. [28] obtained lower tar yields above 600 °C, with the minimum tar content observing at 700 °C, although the highest H2 production of 10.0 wt% was achieved at 650 °C. Higher activity of the catalyst was also reported by Koike et al. [29] when temperature was increased from 550 to 650 °C, with a considerable reduction in the amount of coke deposited, which is the main deactivation cause of the catalyst in the pyrolysis-reforming of biomass [219,242,250] and bio-oil reforming processes [192,195,201,273,274]. Shen et al. [245] also reported a slight increase in tar conversion efficiency from 92.3 to 100 wt% using RHC Ni catalyst when temperature was increased in the 500–900 °C range. Concerning H2 production, Waheed and Williams [242] used a high reforming temperature (950 °C) for the pyrolysis-reforming of rice husk, sugar cane bagasse and wheat straw, obtaining a maximum H2 production of 5.1 wt% when rice husk and wheat straw were fed, whereas 4.9 wt% was obtained with sugar cane bagasse on 10 wt% Ni/dolomite catalyst, with these values being higher than those obtained with only dolomite. When pine wood was valorised by Arregi et al. [31] by pyrolysis-reforming strategy, an increase in H2 yield was reported when reforming temperature was increased from 550 to 600 °C, whereas in the 600–700 °C range H2 production kept at around 11.0 wt%. In the same way, by increasing the reforming temperature, the concentrations of H2 and CO in the gaseous stream increase, which is explained by the endothermic nature of the reforming reactions (for both oxygenated compounds and CH4). Cao et al. [243] obtained a H2 concentration of 66.6 vol% at 500 °C on a commercial Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, with the maximum value being 70.0 vol% when a temperature of 550 °C was used, although the maximum H2 production (11.6 wt%) was obtained at a temperature of 650 °C. The importance of the exothermic WGS reaction should be noted, given that it plays an essential role in this process and is favoured at relatively low temperatures, producing H2 and CO2 as main products. Thus, Arregi et al. [31] reported similar H2 concentration (of around 66 vol%) in the 550–700 °C range, although a slight decrease in CO2 and, especially, an increase in CO concentration was observed. 6.2.2 Space time The reforming space time is another important factor in order to ensure a tar-free gas product to be used for different applications. When space time is increased, steam reforming and WGS reactions are enhanced, favouring the formation of H2 and CO2 and hindering that of CO. This conclusion was reported by Xiao et al. [249], who observed a slight increase in H2 production from 6.2 to 7.3 wt% and in CO2 from 70.0 to 87.1 wt% when space velocity was reduced from 11,000 to 9,200 h−1, whereas CO and CH4 decrease from 23.0 to 19.9 wt% and from 9.1 to 2.9 wt%, respectively. Cao et al. [243] also observed that higher total gas yield and H2 production were obtained and lower coke was deposited on the catalyst when space time was increased. Higher tar reforming efficiency was reported by Shen et al. [245], which increased from 50.1 to 99.8% when catalyst mass was increased from 3 to 10 g, using a RHC Ni catalyst and a reforming temperature of 700 °C. Moreover, this catalyst is highly stable, as evidenced by the almost constant tar reforming efficiency (99.6%) after 5 reforming cycles. The influence of space time between 2.5 and 30 gcatalyst min gvolatiles −1 using a commercial Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was studied by Arregi et al. [31], who reported a high H2 production of 11.7 wt% by displacing the WGS reaction and at the same time reforming CH4 and light hydrocarbons. 6.2.3 Steam to C ratio Amongst the different reforming agents, steam is one of the most used in the literature and the S/C ratio is a relevant factor in reforming processes. Efika et al. [250] studied the reforming process without and with steam, and the enhancement of gas yield with steam addition was reported, increasing from 40.5 to 45.3 wt% without catalyst and to 54.0 wt% when NiO/SiO2 catalyst was used. Moreover, H2 concentration increased from 14.0 (sand without steam) to 18.2 vol% (sand with steam) and to 44.4 vol% when NiO/Al2O3 catalyst was used. Cao et al. [243] also studied the effect of steam partial pressure (SPP) between 30 and 53 kPa, obtaining a higher H2 yield and lower carbon deposition at high steam partial pressure values. Moreover, higher H2 and CO2 and lower CO and CH4 yields are obtained by increasing S/C ratio due especially to the displacement of the WGS reaction equilibrium. A significant effect was reported by Arregi et al. [31] when they increased S/C ratio between 3.9 and 9.7, i.e., H2 yield increased from 89.2 to 94.2% and CO2 yield from 84.0 to 90.1%, whereas CO decreased from 14.4 to 8.9% in the same S/C ratio range. Zou et al. [241] studied the influence of steam addition between 0 and 0.2 g min−1, obtaining a maximum H2 production of 5.9 wt% between 0.05 and 0.1 g min−1 of steam addition, without any improvement above this value. Thus, when steam to C ratio is increased, higher H2 production in the gaseous fraction and lower tar content (non-converted product) are obtained, given that steam enhances both reforming and WGS reactions, although higher S/C ratio requires higher external heat supply [249]. Therefore, the optimization of this factor is necessary in order to obtain an economically viable process."
16,Catalysts,"6.3 Catalysts Although different catalysts can be used for reforming of oxygenated compounds, the most used ones are those based on Ni and Co due mainly to its low cost in relation to noble metals, such as, Pt, Pd, Ru or Rh. Efika et al. [250] investigated three different catalysts: NiO/Al2O3, NiO/CeO2/Al2O3 and NiO/SiO2 (prepared by an incipient wetness method and by a sol-gel method). The sol-gel NiO/SiO2 catalyst produced the highest gas yield, whereas NiO/CeO2/Al2O3 was the catalyst with the lowest gas production. Nevertheless, NiO/Al2O3 was the catalyst giving the highest H2 concentration of 44.4 vol%. Koike et al. [29] compared three different catalysts and the lower coke formation was observed for Ni + MnOx/Al2O3 followed by Ni + CeO2/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Li et al. [258] investigated Ni-Cu/Mg/Al bimetallic catalysts with different Cu/Ni ratios, obtaining higher activity and lower deactivation by coke when Cu/Ni ratio was 0.25, with the results being better compared to monometallic Ni/Mg/Al and Cu/Mg/Al catalysts. Chen et al. [237] studied Fe-Zn/Al2O3 nanocatalysts with different Zn/Al ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4), and a maximum H2 concentration and production of 40 vol% and 1.9 wt%, respectively, were obtained when 1:1 ratio was used. They have also investigated Ni/CaAlOx catalysts with different Ca/Al molar ratios (1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) [27] and H2 concentration and production of 45 vol% and 3.1 wt%, respectively, were obtained when a Ca/Al molar ratio of 1:2 was used. Dong et al. [238] synthesized NiZnAlOx catalysts with different Ni molar fractions (5, 10, 15, 25 and 35%), obtaining the maximum H2 production (4.0 wt%) when 35% Ni was used. Concerning catalyst supports, although Al2O3 is commonly used, different kinds of supports can be found in the literature. Li et al. [257] reported a higher activity for Co catalyst when they are supported on BaAl12O19 than on other supports, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, MgO and TiO2 due to its high dispersion. Moreover, Waheed et al. [275] used a 10 wt% Ni-dolomite catalyst, obtaining a maximum H2 production of 6.1 wt% when rice husk was fed. Ye et al. [276] studied size-confined Ni catalysts on acidic MCM-41 supports and obtained a maximum H2 production of 4.3 wt%. Jin et al. [239] studied the effect calcium addition has on Ni-Mg-AlOx catalyst and observed that H2 production increased from 2.1 to 3.6 wt%. Santamaria et al. [277] compared five different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, TiO2 and ZrO2) and Al2O3, MgO and ZrO2 were those leading to the most encouraging results. Furthermore, the use of char is gaining increasing attention recently and several studies using it as support have been published. Thus, Xiao et al. [249] compared a commercial Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and Ni/BCC (brown coal char), and higher H2, CO and CH4 yields, lower tar content and higher resistance to coke deposition were observed when Ni/BCC catalyst was used. Yao et al. [278] used biochar as a catalyst in the pyrolysis-reforming of wheat straw, obtaining a maximum H2 concentration and production of 64.02 vol% and 9.21 wt%, respectively. The group headed by Prof. Yoshikawa also studied Ni-Fe catalysts [244] and Ni catalysts [245,255] supported on rice husk char (RHC). They reported higher tar removal efficiency with RHC Ni and RHC Ni-B catalysts, 96.9 and 98.6%, respectively, compared to Ni-Fe char catalyst, for which a maximum efficiency of 92.3% was achieved. It should be pointed out that the recovery of the char from the pyrolysis step is of great interest for the viability of the process."
17,Main remarks and conclusions,"Table 5 compares different routes for H2 production from biomass and bio-oil by thermochemical processes. Considering the different reactor configurations, plant size, operating conditions and catalysts used in the processes studied in the literature, it is difficult to compare the H2 production obtained by the different routes. In addition, it should be pointed out that the values of H2 production mentioned in the previous sections have been calculated based using different feeds (based on 100 g of biomass, bio-oil or organics). Consequently, an average H2 production (wt%) based on 100 g of biomass has been calculated for all the processes using the results obtained in the literature. In the processes in which bio-oil is in the feed, H2 production has been calculated considering a bio-oil yield of 75 wt% in the pyrolysis step [134]; that is, the bio-oil lost in the condensation and vaporization processes not been considered in the calculation, which would decrease the production of H2 in these processes. Moreover, biomass heterogeneity is a fact to be taken into account. Thus, biomass type, particle size, moisture content and ash composition are different in each study and so the values showed in Table 5 are average values calculated from the literature. As observed in Table 5, supercritical water gasification and bio-oil gasification are the routes in which the lowest H2 production have been obtained, 4 g and 3 g of H2 per 100 g of biomass, respectively. It should be pointed out that these routes have been scarcely studied in the literature, and therefore their technology is less developed than those of the other routes. Although supercritical water gasification can treat biomass with high moisture content, this process has several drawbacks involving biomass feeding and high energy costs, which makes it unfeasible at large scale. In the case of bio-oil gasification, the higher energy density of the bio-slurry compared to bio-oil is an interesting advantage, although bio-oil feeding problems, low energy efficiency and high energy costs explain the low technological development of this process. Biomass steam gasification is one of the main thermochemical routes studied in the literature, achieving an average H2 production of 4 g (without catalyst) and 7 g (with catalyst) per 100 g of biomass. The need of a secondary catalyst in the gasification process is noteworthy, as evidenced by the low H2 production obtained with a primary catalyst, which complicates the gasification process and increases energy costs due to the high temperatures needed in both steps. The major challenge of biomass gasification is tar reduction, given that tar causes serious problems for syngas further use in synthesis, even when secondary catalysts are used. Therefore, optimization of the catalyst is imperative in order to improve its stability and regeneration. Concerning raw bio-oil steam reforming, which has also been extensively studied in the literature, an average H2 production of 10 g per 100 g of biomass has been achieved. The higher energy density of the bio-oil compared to biomass and the lower temperatures needed for its reforming compared to biomass gasification make it an interesting strategy for bio-oil valorisation, although the scaling up of the process is its major challenge nowadays. Moreover, as mentioned above, bio-oil feeding still involves drawbacks because part of the bio-oil is lost in the condensation and volatilization steps. Comparing both strategies, biomass gasification is carried out in large centralized plants located in the regions where biomass is available, whereas in the bio-oil reforming strategy, biomass pyrolysis is carried out in decentralized small pyrolysis plants and the bio-oil is transported to centralized bio-oil reforming plants, thereby reducing the transportation costs due to the higher energy density of the bio-oil compared to biomass. Nevertheless, the technology for biomass gasification is more developed than that for bio-oil reforming, which is still in a preliminary phase. Furthermore, the results obtained in the two-step pyrolysis-reforming of biomass are encouraging as an alternative way of biomass gasification and bio-oil reforming for H2 production, achieving an average H2 production of 10 g per 100 g of biomass. This route allows optimizing both pyrolysis and reforming steps and avoids the problems related to raw bio-oil feeding. The main advantage of this process is that a free-tar product is obtained, which is the biggest challenge of biomass gasification. Moreover, it is a good strategy in the areas in which biomass is available, although there are still issues to be resolved. The deactivation of the catalyst and, especially, its stability are essential in order to scale up this process, although few studies in the literature deal with the deactivation of the catalyst and its influence on product distribution. Moreover, although different kinds of metal phases, supports and promoters have been used, there are no studies in which their regeneration by coke combustion or steam gasification has been carried out, with these aspects being highly relevant for future studies. Therefore, the two-step process is a different route for H2 production, which may be a good alternative for gasification and bio-oil reforming processes. Moreover, easy scaling up is the main advantage of the pyrolysis and in-line reforming process, which in turn avoids transportation of the bio-oil needed in the bio-oil reforming process. Nevertheless, the use of one or another strategy depends on the area in which it will be installed, their technological development and the measures taken in order to resolve the problems mentioned above."
