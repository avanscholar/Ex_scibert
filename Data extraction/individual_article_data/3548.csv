0,Introduction,"With the rapid increase of the world biodiesel production in recent years, a glut of glycerol is produced as a byproduct of the biodiesel industry, and nearly 1 ton of glycerol was produced for 9 tons of biodiesel. A large surplus leads to inexpensive glycerol, which was listed in top 10 potential candidates by U.S.DOE [1] for producing bio-based chemical products. Many researchers focused on using this cheap glycerol as a raw material to produce high value-added chemicals like 1,3-propanediol [2], acrolein [3] and hydroxyl acetone [4]. In particular, using glycerol to produce hydrogen has also received much attention. Hydrogen has attracted extensive attention as a clean fuel. However, at present, 96% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels [5]. Bio-based or other renewable hydrogen is expected for future sustainable utilization and environmental advantages. The biodiesel glycerol produced from biomass was considered to be renewable and carbon neutral, which can provide the opportunity for producing renewable hydrogen. Many methods have been applied to convert glycerol to hydrogen, including fermentation [6,7], steam reforming [8–10], autothermal reforming [11], aqueous-phase reforming [12] and supercritical water gasification (SCWG) [13,14]. All these methods were reviewed by Adhikari et al. [15]. Among these methods, SCWG of hydrocarbons and biomass are supposed to be a promising method for hydrogen production [16–18]. Supercritical water (SCW) is defined as the water beyond the critical point (374 °C, 22.1 MPa) and has many unique properties, such as low viscosity, high diffusivity and low dielectric constant. These properties make SCW a good solvent for both organics and gases, providing a homogenous condition for gasification with short residence time and high-efficiency [19,20]. In recent decades, much research into SCWG has been done and a large variety of feedstocks and model compounds were gasified in SCW, such as wood [21], sludge [22], coal [23], glucose [24], cellulose [25], phenol [26] and C-1 compounds [27]. However, for glycerol gasification in SCW, very few studies have been reported(less than 10), especially with respect to hydrogen production. Antal et al. [28] first studied the glycerol decomposition in SCW at 500 °C and 34.5 MPa, they found the gaseous products contained H2, CO2, CO, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6. Kersten et al. [21] reported that only dilute glycerol solution can be completely converted to gas phase without catalysts. Byrd et al. [13] reported that near-theoretical hydrogen yield of 7 mol/mol glycerol was achieved by reforming 5 wt% glycerol solution in SCW over Ru/Al2O3 as a catalyst at 800 °C. May et al. [29] used Ru/ZrO2 to catalyze glycerol gasification in SCW, but the hydrogen yield was very low, which was less than 0.6 mol/mol glycerol at 550 °C and 35 MPa. Chakinala et al. [14] gasified glycerol as a model compound of microalgae in SCW and studied the influence of additives (l-alanine, glycine, l-proline and K2CO3) on gasification, they found the addition of amino acid caused coke formation, while the addition of K2CO3 enhanced the gasification. Onwudili et al. [30] studied biodiesel plant waste (20.8 wt% methanol, 42.3 wt% glycerol and 33.1 wt% fatty acid methyl esters) reforming under subcritical and supercritical water conditions, a gaseous effluent containing up to 90% by molar fraction of hydrogen was obtained during alkaline gasification. To date, the number of experimental runs on SCWG of glycerol is still limited. In addition, most of the previous works were done with low glycerol concentration and in miniature scale (both batch and continuous flow reactors). In order to obtain more information about the hydrogen production behavior of the glycerol gasification in SCW and further determine the feasibility of SCWG of glycerol, in this work, high glycerol concentration (10–50 wt%) was gasified in a bench-scale continuous flow tubular reactor at a temperature range of 445∼600 °C and 25 MPa, with a short residence time of 3.9∼9.0 s. The effects of reaction temperature, residence time and glycerol concentration on gasification were systematically studied. Considering the fact that the crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel industry always contains alkalis [31,32], the influences of four types of alkali catalysts (NaOH, Na2CO3, KOH and K2CO3) on gasification were investigated. Based on the pseudo first-order kinetics assumption, the overall reaction rate of glycerol carbon gasification was analyzed. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor were also obtained for chemical reaction engineering to design and scale up the SCWG reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials The glycerol(>99.0 wt%) used in this study was produced by Tianjin Fu Chen Chemical Reagent Factory. The KOH and NaOH were obtained from Tianjin HonYan Chemical Reagent Factory. Anhydrous K2CO3 and Na2CO3 were provided by Tianjin TianLi Chemical Reagents Ltd. All these reagents were analytical pure.
3,Reactor system and experimental procedures,"2.2 Reactor system and experimental procedures The experiments were done in a continuous SCWG system developed in our laboratory. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of this system [23]. The maximum throughput capacity of the system is 16 kg/h. The reactor was fabricated from Hastelloy-C276 tubing with 17.15 mm o.d. × 10.85 mm i.d. × 1.24 m length. The design temperature and pressure were 800 °C and 30 MPa, respectively. During the experiments, the feedstock (glycerol solution) was first mixed with preheated water to realize fast heating for avoiding side reactions [33]. The flow ratio of feedstock and preheated water was 1:4 in all experiments. Then, the mixture flow entered the reactor which was located in an oven and heated by electric stove wires. A PID controller was used to maintain the reactor at the desired temperature. The reaction temperature mentioned in this paper was measured by a K type thermocouple inserted in the reactor. The pressure of the system was controlled by a back pressure regulator. The products flow after the reaction were cooled down in the cooler, and a gas-liquid separator after the back pressure regulator was used to separate the products. The flow rate of gaseous product was measured by a wet type gas meter. The liquid was collected for further analysis. More detailed information about this system can be found in our previous work [23,34]. The uncertainty of experimental measurements was analyzed. The uncertainty of temperature and pressure are less than 2.06% and 2.00% respectively; the uncertainty of gas yield is less than 2.17%."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The composition of the gaseous products was measured by Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph(GC), which was equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and capillary column C-2000 purchased from LanZhou Institute of Chemical Physics in China. High purity helium with a flow rate of 30 ml/min was used as the carrier gas. The liquid effluent was pretreated by solid phase extraction (SPE), using Agilent SampliQ C8 SPE columns. Then, the organic extract sample was injected into the GC(Agilent 6890) with HP-INNOWax capillary column. A mass selective detector (MSD5973) was used to identify the organics in the sample."
5,Data interpretation,"2.4 Data interpretation The residence time is defined as the reactor volume (V) divided by volumetric flow rate of reaction flow (Vo ) at reaction temperature and pressure: (1) τ = V V o = L A ρ Q Where L is the length of reactor (m), A is the inner cross-section area (m2), ρ is the density of the reaction flow which was assumed to be the pure water at the reaction condition (kg/m3), Q is the mass flow rate of reaction flow (kg/s). The gasification efficiency (GE), carbon gasification efficiency (CE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HE) were defined as the following equations: (2) GE = (the total mass of the product gas)/(the total mass of the feedstock) (3) CE = (the total carbon in the product gas)/(the total carbon in the feedstock) (4) HE = (total hydrogen in the product gas)/(the total hydrogen in the feedstock)"
6,Result and discussion,
7,Effect of temperature,"3.1 Effect of temperature Reaction temperature is the most important parameter that influences the SCWG [19]. Higher temperatures promote the free–radical reactions [35] which lead to higher gas yield. Fig. 2 shows results of 10 wt% glycerol gasification in SCW in the temperature range of 445∼600 °C at 25 MPa and a flow rate of 5 kg/h. The main gaseous products were H2, CO, CO2 and CH4, with a small amount of C2H4 and C2H6. As shown in Fig. 2, when the temperature was 445 °C, the gasification efficiency was only 4.3%, indicating that at 445 °C or below, the C–C bond of glycerol may not be broken, and little glycerol was gasified. However, even in this low temperature, no tar or char was observed. As the temperature increased from 487 to 600 °C, the gasification efficiency was greatly promoted, increasing from 38% to 102%, carbon gasification efficiency increased from 31% to 89%, and hydrogen gasification efficiency increased from 35% to 105%, meaning that the SCW also contributed some hydrogen in product gas. The hydrogen yield of 3.47 mol/mol was obtained at 600 °C, which was half of theoretical limit of equation (5). At different temperatures, the yields of CO and CO2 were about the same value. The methane yield slightly increased with increasing temperature, while it was still low and only 0.24 mol/mol at 600 °C. The gas composition was almost unchanged when the temperature increased, the molar faction of H2, CO/CO2, CH4 and C2H x were about 57%, 18%∼20%, 3%∼4% and <1%, respectively. The fast-type water-gas shift reaction [24] was not observed in this work, perhaps because our experiments did not reach the needed temperature for that reaction, which must exceed 660 °C according to Lee’s work [24]. (5) C3H8O3 + 3H2O → 3CO2 + 7H2 It is believed that the gases and organics can dissolve in SCW, making the mixture a single-phase [20], but when the effluent flow was cooled to ambient temperature, since the smaller solubility at ambient temperature than that in SCW, the gaseous products like hydrogen and carbon monoxide would escape from the water. So, the gradually cooled effluent would change from a single-phase flow to a gas-liquid two-phase flow. Moreover, when the total gas yield reached a certain value, for instance, 2.33L/min (at 600 °C,10 wt%,5 kg/h), which meant that the volume fraction of total gas yield was as high as 12% in the whole effluent flow at 25 MPa. We observed that the liquid and the gas passed through the back pressure regulator alternately, causing slight intermittent impact on the back pressure regulator and pipeline system due to the quite different compressibility factors between liquid effluent and gas. This impact phenomenon was similar to the impact which occurred in slug flow and might cause damages to the experimental system [36]. So, this phenomenon should be considered and avoided in the further SCWG system developments, especially for scaling-up."
8,Effect of residence time,"3.2 Effect of residence time The effect of residence time on the gasification of 10 wt% glycerol in SCW was investigated at 487 °C and 567 °C, respectively. The different residence times were obtained by changing the flow rate. As shown in Fig. 3 , at 487 °C, the increase of residence time can significantly enhance glycerol gasification. When the residence time increased from 5.2 to 9.0 s, the gasification efficiency increased from 8% to 42% and the hydrogen yield increased from 0.35 to 1.35 mol/mol, nearly a 4-fold increase. However, the increasing trend of gasification efficiency decreased with increasing residence time, indicating that further extending the residence time cannot significantly increase gasification efficiency if the temperature remained at 487 °C. While at a higher temperature of 567 °C, as shown in Fig. 4 , the gasification efficiency, carbon gasification efficiency and hydrogen gasification efficiency only showed a slightly increasing tendency with increasing residence time. When the residence time increased from 4.2 to 7.3 s, the gasification efficiency increased from 84% to 94% and the hydrogen yield only increased from 3.13 to 3.37 mol/mol, such results indicated it was not necessary to take longer residence time at higher temperatures. A shorter residence time of 7.0 s was sufficient to obtain relatively high gasification efficiency and could increase the treating capacity of the system."
9,Effect of concentration,"3.3 Effect of concentration Fig. 5 shows the effect of glycerol concentration on gasification at 567 °C, 25 MPa. As the glycerol concentration increased from 10 to 25 wt%, the gasification efficiency, hydrogen gasification efficiency and carbon gasification efficiency decreased from 88%, 93% and 75% to 72%, 72% and 69%, respectively. The hydrogen gasification efficiency decreased more quickly than carbon gasification efficiency. The molar fractions of H2 and CO2 decreased from 59.3% and 18.3% to 53.6% and 10.7%, respectively. The molar fraction of CO increased greatly from 17.9% to 29.7%. The molar fractions of CH4 and C2H x changed little with increasing concentration. However, further increase in concentration did not affect the gas yield and gas composition too much, the gasification efficiency and the molar fractions of different gases remained stable when the concentration increased from 25 to 50 wt%. In addition, it is worth noting that even the glycerol concentration was as high as 50 wt%, the gasification efficiency and hydrogen gasification efficiency still maintained a relatively high level (were about 70%), and the hydrogen molar fraction reached 52%, no tar or char was observed. To explain the tendency shown in Fig. 5, we inferred that the gases were mainly from two types of reactions, one was the pyrolysis of glycerol and intermediate products, and the other was steam reforming of glycerol and intermediate products. The steam reforming Reaction (6) may be very sensitive to water concentration, because water is a reactant and higher glycerol concentration may lead water to become the limiting reactant. While the pyrolysis Reaction (7) may be insensitive to water concentration. When the glycerol concentration initially increased from 10 to 25 wt%, the yields of H2 and CO2 from the steam reforming Reaction (6) decreased sharply because of the decreased water concentration, so the gasification efficiency and hydrogen gasification efficiency decreased, and the molar fractions of H2 and CO2 also decreased. Further increase in glycerol concentration, the gas yield from the steam reforming reaction became very low, while the pyrolysis reaction which was insensitive to water concentration became the main source of gas yield, resulting in that the gas yield and gas composition remained stable with increasing glycerol concentration. So, the increase of glycerol concentration may have an unfavorable effect on the steam reforming reaction, while it has little effect on pyrolysis reaction.

10,Effect of alkali catalysts addition,"3.4 Effect of alkali catalysts addition 3.4.1 The effect of different alkali catalysts The crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel industry always contains some alkalis due to base catalytic transesterification process [31,32]. Many smaller biodiesel plants simply discard the glycerol byproduct as a waste, because it was expensive to remove soluble alkalis in crude glycerol [37]. While in SCWG process, it is reported [38–40] that alkali catalysts like KOH, NaOH, K2CO3 and Na2CO3 can significantly enhance the water-gas shift Reaction (8). We can take advantage of alkalis in crude glycerol in SCWG. In this study, the effect of various alkali catalysts (K2CO3, KOH, NaOH and Na2CO3) on 10 wt% glycerol gasification was investigated at the lower temperature of 526 °C, 6.5 s residence time. The amount of catalysts addition was 0.5 wt%. As shown in Fig. 6 , the addition of alkali catalysts significantly increased the H2 and CO2 yields and decreased CO yield. When 0.5 wt% NaOH was used, the H2 gas yield was up to 4.55 mol/mol, the CO gas yield was only 0.09 mol/mol, while these values without catalyst were 2.57 mol/mol and 0.86 mol/mol, respectively. The hydrogen gasification efficiency was up to 118.2%, which confirmed that the water-gas shift reaction was greatly enhanced, and some extra gaseous hydrogen was from water. Moreover, although we try to control the reaction temperature at 526 °C using the same thermal boundary conditions in all experiments, we found the reaction temperatures with alkali catalysts were about 10 °C higher than those without alkali catalysts, indicating that the exothermic reaction which was supposed to be water-gas shift Reaction (8) occurred intensely. Fig. 6 also showed that the activity of catalysts with respect to the hydrogen yields decreased in the order of NaOH > Na2CO3> KOH > K2CO3. The different catalytic effects may be the integrated result of different solubility, different dissociation constants, different charge density and different molecular weights among these four alkali catalysts in SCW. Xu et al. [41] reported that Na2CO3 had a negative effect on glycerol gasification, which was in contrast to our results. This may be because in his experiments, the side reactions like polyglycerine formation occurred in preheater(the author observed some black intermediates in preheat process at 200 °C), the Na2CO3 may promoted these side reactions in subcritical condition. While in our experiments, the glycerol was quickly heated to higher temperature, so the side reactions may be avoided. Although the hydrogen gasification efficiency was largely increased after adding alkali catalysts, It can be seen from Table 1 that the improvement of carbon gasification efficiency was not obvious, which was similar to the results of Kersten et al. [21]. (8) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 Meanwhile, the composition of gas products before and after adding catalysts also changed significantly. Table 2 displays the molar fractions of gases with and without various catalysts. The theoretical values of molar fractions of gases at the thermodynamic equilibrium state were also given by using the method from Lu and Yan [42,43]. From Table 2, it can be seen that the addition of alkali catalysts made the molar fractions of gases draw close to the thermodynamic equilibrium values. The molar fractions of hydrogen and CO2 without catalysts were 57.5% and 19.3%, respectively, while these values were increased to 68.9% and 28.4% with 0.5 wt% NaOH, which were very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium value 69.3% and 30.1%, respectively. The molar fraction of CO decreased from 19.2% to 1.4% before and after adding 0.5 wt% NaOH. 3.4.2 The effect of catalysts amount The effect of the amount of alkali catalysts on glycerol gasification was investigated by adding different amount of (0.05, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 wt%) NaOH into 10 wt% glycerol solution at 526 °C. As shown in Fig. 7 , the gasification efficiency, carbon gasification efficiency and hydrogen gasification efficiency firstly increased with increasing amount of NaOH, the maximum of hydrogen yield of 4.93 mol/mol was obtained when the amount of NaOH was 0.1 wt%, the hydrogen gasification efficiency was up to 128%. As the amount of NaOH increased further, the hydrogen yield and gasification efficiency slightly decreased. We assumed the solubility limitation may be one of the reasons causing the tendency shown in Fig. 7. That is, the catalytic effect increased with increasing concentration of NaOH below the solubility value. However, when the concentration of NaOH exceeded the solubility value, further increase in NaOH addition may not improve the gasification because the surplus NaOH could not be dissolved. Therefore, it did not mean that the more amount of catalyst the better glycerol gasification result in SCW. Moreover, it is reported that the alkalis were always precipitated in the reactor system due to their low solubility [34], and too much alkali salts may accelerate the plugging process. So, on the premise of guaranteeing the catalytic effect for gasification, the amount of alkali catalysts used should be as small as possible."
11,Kinetics,"The liquid collected in our experiments was analyzed by GC–MS and the liquid products, such as acrolein, allyl alcohol, hydroxyl acetone, acetaldehyde and propionic acid were identified. Moreover, small molecular products like methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid were also detected in near- and SCWG of glycerol by other researchers [29,35]. According to these liquid products and the discussion of 3.3, we inferred that when the glycerol mixed with hot preheated water, the dehydration of glycerol first occurred, forming acrolein and hydroxyl acetone. As the temperature increased and reached a certain value, the pyrolysis of glycerol happened and the C–C bond of glycerol was broken, resulting in the formation of C-1 and C-2 compounds like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde [28]. Meanwhile, some CO, CO2, H2 and a small amount of CH4 may be also released in the pyrolysis process [13]. The intermediate products produced from the reactions mentioned above were subsequently converted to CO, CO2 and H2 by steam reforming and further pyrolysis. In order to obtain the basic kinetics information of glycerol gasification in SCW, we did a series of experiments at 25 MPa, using 10%wt glycerol solution, with various temperatures and residence times. Generally, the overall reaction rate of glycerol carbon gasification r may be expressed as follows: (9) r = − d [ C g c ] d τ = k ′ [ C g c ] a [ C H 2 O ] b Where Cgc, C H 2 O are the molar fraction of total carbon (mol/L) and the molar fraction of water (mol/L) in glycerol solution respectively; τ is residence time (s); a, b are the empirical orders of reaction and k’ is the “true” reaction rate constant. Considering that the initial glycerol concentration was fixed and the molar fraction of water was much larger than that of glycerol, we assumed [ C H 2 O ] b was a constant. Meanwhile, we supposed a = 1, so, the equation (9) can be expressed as: (10) r = − d [ C g c ] d τ = k [ C g c ] where k = k ′ [ C H 2 O ] b , represents an apparent reaction rate constant for glycerol carbon gasification. In fact, the equation (10) is a pseudo first-order kinetics for glycerol carbon gasification in SCW. For pseudo first-order kinetics, the relationship between − ln(1− X) and τ can be shown as below by integration of equation (10) [19]: (11) − ln ( 1 − X ) = k τ where X is the carbon gasification efficiency (CE). Fig. 8 shows the plots of − ln(1− X) versus τ at different reaction temperatures. According to equation (11), k value at each reaction temperature can be determined by the slope of the straight line in Fig. 8. The k values were in the range of 0.042∼0.379 s−1 at the temperature of 487∼600 °C. Although the non-Arrhenius behavior of the overall degradation of glycerol was founded by Buhler et al. [35], the non-Arrhenius behavior mainly occurred at sub- and near-critical conditions, considered to be the overlay of ionic and free–radical reactions [35]. While in this work, the temperature range was 487∼600 °C and the low temperature range was avoided. Therefore, in our experiments, the ionic pathway which was supposed to be dominated at sub- and near-critical temperature could be neglected compared to the free-radical pathway which prefers higher temperatures. Fig. 9 shows the Arrhenius plot of the k values obtained in the range of 487∼600 °C. The apparent activation energy Ea and apparent pre-exponential factor A in Arrhenius equation (12) were obtained through linear least-squares regression, which were 104.5 ± 20.3 kJ/mol and 105.90±1.30 s−1 respectively (The ± indicates 95% confidence interval). Chakinala et al. [14] reported the apparent activation energy of carbon gasification of 10 wt% glycerol was 110 kJ/mol, which was quite close to our result. Byrd et al. [13] reported the activation energy Ea of glycerol gasification was 55.9 kJ/mol, which was smaller than our result, because in their work, they used Ru/Al2O3 as a catalyst, resulting in a reduction in the activation energy. (12) k = A exp ( − E a R T ) It is worth noting that the kinetics obtained above is not a universal equation which could predict all experimental results due to the assumptions made above. For example, it may not be suitable for SCWG of other concentration glycerol solutions which largely deviate from 10 wt%, because k = k ′ [ C H 2 O ] b may be greatly changed due to various molar fractions of water. Nevertheless, the main purpose of giving our simplified pseudo first-order kinetics was to provide a basic information of glycerol gasification in SCW for those who are using similar reactor systems and experimental conditions, and give them an initial concept of the magnitude about reaction rate constants and Arrhenius parameters of SCWG of glycerol."
12,Conclusions,"Glycerol was successfully gasified in SCW and hydrogen-rich gas products (hydrogen molar fraction was 52.0–68.9%) were obtained. No char or tar was observed in all experiments. The experimental results showed that using biodiesel glycerol as a renewable source to produce hydrogen by SCWG had good prospects. The glycerol gasification efficiency and the hydrogen yield increased sharply with increasing temperature above 487 °C, 102% and 3.47 mol/mol was achieved at 600 °C, respectively. While at the temperature below 445 °C, the glycerol was little gasified. The increasing of residence time can significantly enhance glycerol gasification at 487 °C. While at a higher temperature of 567 °C, a short residence time of 7.0 s was sufficient to obtain relatively high gasification efficiency, and further extending of residence time was not necessary. When the glycerol concentration increased from 10 to 50 wt%, the gasification efficiency and hydrogen yield decreased rapidly at first and then remained steady. Due to the gas-water two-phase flow of cooled reactor effluent, the intermittent impact on the back pressure regulator and pipeline system was observed when the gas yield was high. The alkali catalysts can greatly increase the gasification efficiency and hydrogen yield by promoting water-gas shift reaction. The hydrogen yield with respect to catalysts was in the following order: NaOH > Na2CO3>KOH > K2CO3. The hydrogen yield of 4.93 mol/mol was achieved at 526 °C with 0.1 wt% NaOH. A simple kinetics study was done by assuming pseudo first-order kinetics. The overall rate constant of glycerol carbon gasification in SCW was in the range of 0.042∼0.379 s−1 at a temperature of 487∼600 °C. The apparent activation energy and apparent pre-exponential factor for glycerol carbon gasification were 104.5 kJ/mol and 105.90 s−1, respectively."
