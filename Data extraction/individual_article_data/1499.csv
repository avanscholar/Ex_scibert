0,Introduction,"Primary amines are important chemicals for manufacturing dyes, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, biologically active compounds, and surfactants [1–16]. Conventionally, primary amines are synthesized from alkyl halides, nitro complexes, and/or nitriles, during which harmful by-products and waste are generated [6,17–20]. It is desirable to develop improved protocols to synthesize primary amines from inexpensive and environmentally more benign reagents. The direct amination of alcohols with ammonia has been regarded as an alternative for amine production [1,2,21–34]. Since a number of alcohols can be obtained from renewable carbon resources and water is the sole by-product of the reaction, the amination of biomass-derived alcohols to corresponding amines is envisioned as a promising route for transforming amine synthesis into a more sustainable manner [23,28,35–40]. Along with the identification of a number of heterogeneous catalysts for alcohol amination [39], the fundamental understanding of these catalysts has attracted intensive research efforts [1,26,27,29,41–43]. It has reached a consensus among the community that the mechanism of alcohol amination generally comprises three sequential steps: [27] 1) dehydrogenation of alcohol to aldehyde/ketone, 2) CN coupling between aldehyde/ketone and ammonia to form imines, and 3) hydrogenation of imines to amines. Many studies have shown that the initial dehydrogenation step is the rate-determining one along the amination process [27,32,42,44–46]. Previous reports have also proved that the electronic properties of metal sites and the metal-support interactions greatly affect the catalytic performance [26,27,47–51]. For instance, the correlation between N adsorption energy on the catalysts and the selectivity for primary amines was illustrated based on first-principle calculations as well as experimental results [27]. Similarly, the amination of octanol into octylamine on unsupported Ru catalysts was found to be a structure-sensitive reaction, in which the product selectivity strongly depended on the size of the Ru nanoparticles [26]. On the other hand, the understanding of co-adsorbed reagents on the catalyst surface during amination, especially NH3-derived species, was very limited [52]. While the promotional effect of small molecules, such as water [46], ammonia [52,53], and nitrogen [54], is not uncommon in a range of reactions, to our best knowledge, there was only one recent report from C. Michel and co-workers that predicted the beneficial role of ammonia on Ni-based catalysts in amination based on theoretical calculations [52]. Considering these facts, we decide to carry out a systematic study to understand the possible roles of ammonia in amination reaction, which would be helpful to provide a more complete understanding of the reaction mechanism. The investigation focused on supported Ru catalysts since Ru has been extensively used for the direct amination of alcohol [22,24–26,45,55,56] often in batch reactors [21–23]. In this study, we conducted direct amination of iso-propanol with ammonia in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. On the basis of the kinetic study and in situ DRIFTS analysis of the (de)sorption of surface species, it is found that dissociated NH x species on Ru nanoparticles play a key role in promoting the kinetically relevant dehydrogenation step. Further experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the co-adsorbed NH x species on the surface facilitate the OH bond cleavage via the formation of the NH bond. Meanwhile, the moderately strong N-atom adsorption energy for Ru sites effectively suppresses the possibility of further reaction of amine to generate undesired secondary amines, which accounts for the high selectivity towards the desired primary amines on Ru-based catalysts."
1,Experimental section:,
2,Catalyst Preparation.,"2.1 Catalyst Preparation. At room temperature, 500 mg of TiO2 powder (P25, 21 nm, Sigma) was dispersed into 50 mL deionized (DI) water and then sonicated for another 0.5 h. An aqueous solution of metal precursor (RuCl3·xH2O or PdCl2·H2O, Sigma, 2 mL and 2.5 mg/mL) was added into this solution with a metal loading of 1 wt%. After vigorous stirring for 0.5 h, a rapid injection of 0.5 mL of fresh 1 mol/L NaBH4 (Sigma) aqueous solution at room temperature led to the formation of a dark-grey suspension, in concomitance with the release of H2. After another 0.5 h, the sample was collected and washed with deionized water by centrifugation for 4 times. The resultant 1Ru/TiO2 and 1Pd/TiO2 catalysts were further dried at 70 °C overnight in an oven."
3,Catalyst Characterization.,"2.2 Catalyst Characterization. 2.2.1 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The morphology of solid catalysts was performed on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope with an operating voltage of 200 kV (JEM 2100F, JEOL, Japan). The spent samples were collected after direct amination of iso-propanol at 200 °C for 5 h. 2.2.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of fresh and spent catalysts were performed on a high-performance electron spectrometer, coupling with monochromatized Al K α (hν = 1486.7 eV) as the excitation source (ESCALAB 250). Since the samples may contain carbonaceous species [57], the XPS spectra were calibrated by pre-setting the position of the Ti 2p XPS peak to 458.5 eV. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of fresh and spent catalysts were acquired on a Philips X’Pert PROS diffractometer by using a nickel-filtered Cu Kα (wavelength: 0.15418 nm) radiation source. The operating voltage is 40 kV, and the operation current is 50 mA correspondingly. 2.2.4 In situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transformed spectra (In situ DRIFTS). All the in situ DRIFTS experiments were performed on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer, which is equipped with a high-temperature DRIFTS reaction cell (Harrick Scientific Products, INC). 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1 were used to collect spectra for all the experiments with the MCT/A detector in the series mode. The intensities of adsorption peak were evaluated with Kubelka–Munk units, which were proved to be linearly proportional to the surface coverage of adsorbed species [58]. Before the tests, each catalyst (1Ru/TiO2, 1Pd/TiO2 , and bare TiO2, ~ 20 mg) was in situ pretreated in the reaction cell at 300 °C in pure hydrogen (99.997%, 40 mL/min) for 0.5 h, similar to that used for the catalytic test with the fixed-bed reactor. The DRIFTS spectra were collected during two modes as follows. Mode I: Firstly, the catalysts were pre-adsorbed with gaseous NH3 (8 mL/min) at 200 °C for 10 min, and were then purged by pure H2 for 20 min to remove the weak-adsorbed species. After that, 1 μL of acetone or iso-propanol was rapidly injected into the reaction chamber by a micro-injector. Mode II: CO adsorption was studied at 200 °C after pre-treating by purified H2 for 30 min. The catalysts were purged with purified nitrogen gas for 30 min and the background was collected at 200 °C. Then the catalysts were exposed to 5% CO/N2 mixture for the spectra collection. Half an hour later, the gas was switched back to purified nitrogen to flush CO molecules."
4,Catalytic test and kinetic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic test and kinetic measurements 2.3.1 Catalytic performance Measurements of catalytic activities were conducted on a fixed-bed reactor using a stainless-tube with 10 mm inner diameter. Moderate quartz wool was used here to hold the catalyst in the same position with a thermocouple. The temperature of the fixed-bed reactor was modulated by using a temperature controller (YuDian 980P) with a K-type thermocouple. All the gas pipes between the reactor and gas chromatography (GC) were insulated with a heating belt (150 °C) to avoid product condensation. Prior to reaction, all the catalysts were pre-treated at 300 °C under pure H2 flow (50 mL/min) for 0.5 h. In a typical experiment, by using a syringe pump (Harvard PHD 2000 Infusion), liquid iso-propanol or acetone was controllably introduced into a stream mixture of He, H2, and NH3. The set ratio of PH2/Piso-propanol is above 30, which is consistent with the reported reaction conditions for amination in the flow reactor [1,41]. The effluent gas was online analyzed by GC (Agilent 6890A) equipped with a Cyclodex-B capillary column, which contains a flame ionization detector (FID). To calculate the amination rates here, di-propylamine and tri-propylamine were assumed to be formed by the amination of 2 and 3 equivalents of iso-propanol, respectively. 2.3.2 Calculation of forward dehydrogenation rate (rf) The approach to equilibrium factor (η)[59] for iso-propanol dehydrogenation to form acetone and H2 is defined as (1) C H 3 2 C H O H g ↔ K 1 C H 3 2 C O g + H 2 O ( g ) (2) η = P CH 3 2 C O ∙ P H 2 P CH 3 2 C H O H ∙ 1 K 1 where the K 1 is the equilibrium constant. Forward dehydrogenation rates (rf ) are related to the measured rates (rn ) by (3) r n = r f 1 - η The summarized equilibrium constant (K) and equilibrium factor (η) were illustrated in Table S1. 2.3.3 Measurement of apparent activation energy (Ea) and kinetic orders Sieved catalysts diluted with SiO2 powder were used in the kinetic experiments. The SiO2 particles and the catalyst samples were sieved separately and then physically mixed together in a vial before transferring into the reactor tube. Mixing SiO2 with the catalyst brings little effect on the catalytic performance as shown in Figure S1. The temperature and the gas flow rate were correspondingly adjusted to control the conversion below 15%, which result in a negligible change in the concentration of reactants. The product concentration only has a minor effect on the reaction rate in the measured regime both in the presence and absence of ammonia (Table S2). To determine reaction orders over ammonia and iso-propanol, the partial pressure of NH3 was tuned from 2 kPa to 16 kPa, while the concentration of iso-propanol was changed from 1 kPa to 8 kPa during measurements. On account of the reversible hydrogenation reaction, E a was calculated on the basis of forward rates (rf ) as descripted above. The effect of heat/mass transfer during kinetic measurements was carefully excluded according to the reported criterion [60,61], which was discussed in the supporting information."
5,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations,"2.4 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations All DFT calculations were performed by applying plane-wave-based DFT complied in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [62–65]. The electron exchange and correlation energy were solved within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [66] and van der Waals correction by Grimme’s D3BJ method [67]. The plane wave basis was set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The k-points sampling for all structural models was generated following the Monkhorst-Pack procedure with a 4 × 3 × 1 mesh [68]. The transition state (TS) structures were calculated using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [69,70] and the dimer method [71]. Optimization of the atomic positions was achieved by using a quasi-Newton algorithm, which the forces finally were optimized to be less than 0.05 eV Å−1 for all atoms. The Ru(0001) surface was modeled by a supercell containing four Ru layers and 3 × 2 unit cells with the structural data of metallic Ru (a = b = 2.74 Å, c = 4.29 Å) obtained from the website of the Materials Project [72]. These slabs were separated by a vacuum space of 15 Å, and the atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed during geometry optimization."
6,Results and Discussion:,
7,Structural characterization of 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst,"3.1 Structural characterization of 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst Ru species were controllably deposited on the surface of TiO2 and reduced by sodium borohydride. The resultant 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst possessed a narrow size distribution of Ru nanoparticles (2.7 ± 0.8 nm, TEM images shown in Figure S2 of the supporting information) after the catalytic test of iso-propanol amination. The correspondingly exposed fraction (n) of the surface Ru atoms is determined to be 0.45 following a method described in the literature [73]. XRD patterns of the spent 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst (Figure S3) exhibited diffraction peaks exclusively attributable to the TiO2 matrix, consistent with the high dispersions of Ru nanoparticles. As the binding energies of Ru 3p and 3d were strongly overlapped with those for Ti 1 s and C 1 s, no reliable result concerning Ru valent state could be obtained from XPS profiles. Therefore, in situ CO adsorption was further conducted for the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst after H2 pretreatment at 200 °C. As illustrated in Figure S4, several CO adsorption bands on the Ru sites of 1Ru/TiO2 were observed. The predominant band at 2060 cm−1 appears to be derived from di-carbonyl CO adsorption on metallic Ru sites (CO)2-Ru0) [74], while the weakly adsorbed CO signal in the range of 2000–1900 cm−1 could be assigned to bridged CO species on metallic Ru surface [75]."
8,Direct amination of iso-propanol with NH3 over the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst,"3.2 Direct amination of iso-propanol with NH3 over the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst Conversion of iso-propanol over the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst was evaluated in the temperature range of 50–200 °C both with and without NH3. In the absence of NH3, the dominant product was acetone formed from iso-propanol dehydrogenation. Co-feeding NH3 with iso-propanol led to a subsequent conversion of acetone to iso-propylamine via reductive amination. The selectivity of iso-propylamine reached the highest value at 150 °C (89%) and slightly decreased to 78% at 200 °C as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Interestingly, the rate of iso-propanol conversion was significantly enhanced from 0.13 to 0.21 mol/molRu/s when NH3 was added at 200 °C (Table 1 ). To eliminate the influence of thermodynamic limitation (reversed reaction), the promoting effect of NH3 on the forward reaction rate of iso-propanol dehydrogenation (rf , calculation details provided in the experimental section) over 1Ru/TiO2 was evaluated by supplying NH3 at regular intervals within the kinetic regime at 200 °C (Fig. 1B). The forward rate of iso-propanol dehydrogenation repeatedly increased from ~ 0.16 to ~ 0.27 mol/molRu/s (by a factor of ~70%) as the NH3 flow (PNH3 = 13.5 kPa) was switched on. It is noteworthy that alcohol dehydrogenation to carbonyl compound is generally acknowledged as the first step and also the rate-determining step in amination [27,29,45], consistent with the calculated equilibrium factors (η) for iso-propanol dehydrogenation that are smaller than the corresponding equilibrium constants (K 1) as shown in Table S1, especially under relatively high temperature. In addition, the apparent reaction order of iso-propanol (0.84) was relatively high (as shown in Fig. 2 A), and the rate (r) of the acetone conversion with ammonia was faster than that of iso-propanol (0.28 vs. 0.21 mol/molRu/s, Table 1). When H2 is replaced by D2 during iso-propanol amination for 1Ru/TiO2, the measured isotopic effect (KIE) of H/D is only 1.07 (Figure S5), indicating hydrogen is excluded in the rate-determining step. The above evidences are in well agreement with the argument that the dehydrogenation step is rate-limiting for direct amination over Ru-based catalysts."
9,The role of NH3 in the dehydrogenation step on Ru nanoparticles,"3.3 The role of NH3 in the dehydrogenation step on Ru nanoparticles The absence of mass/heat transfer during kinetic tests were confirmed by Madon-Boudart test as shown in Figure S6 and Table S3. It is also confirmed that the partial pressure of H2 has an insignificant thermodynamic influence on the dehydrogenation rate of iso-propanol as shown in Figure S7. It should be emphasized that the equilibrium factor (η) is determined to be 0.05–0.24 within the temperature range of 180–200 °C, indicating the reaction rate (r) is only slightly influenced by the reversed acetone hydrogenation reaction (Table S1) [76]. To identify the origin of the activity enhancement after ammonia introduction, we evaluated the catalytic performance of 1Ru/TiO2 under various NH3 partial pressures. As shown in Fig. 2B, the reaction rate (r) gradually increased with increasing NH3 partial pressure within 0–8 kPa before reaching a plateau as the NH3 partial pressure reached 15 kPa and above. The trend indicates that the promoting effect of NH3 on iso-propanol dehydrogenation over 1Ru/TiO2 positively correlates with the coverage of NH3-related species on the Ru surface, such as adsorbed NH3 molecules and dissociated NH x (x ≤ 2) species. A decrease of the apparent reaction order of iso-propanol from 0.88 to 0.46 by co-feeding NH3 during iso-propanol conversion was observed (Fig. 2A), indicating the enhanced adsorption of iso-propanol on the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst in the presence of NH2* as suggested by DFT calculation (Figure S8). The values of apparent activation energy (E a) for iso-propanol conversion on 1Ru/TiO2 were further determined under various ammonia partial pressures. As shown in Fig. 2C and 2D, the measured E a gradually decreased with increasing NH3 partial pressure, reaching a relatively stable stage after the NH3 partial pressure was larger than 9.1 kPa. These kinetic analyses reveal that NH3-derived surface species intrinsically promote the dehydrogenation step of iso-propanol during the amination reaction on 1Ru/TiO2. Ru-based catalysts are well-known for their high activity in NH3 dissociation [77], and the adsorbed NH x species (x = 1 or 2, denoted as NH x *) may present on the surface of Ru nanoparticles under the reaction condition. In order to discern the NH x species participating in the iso-propanol dehydrogenation step, we investigated the dissociation behavior of NH3 on 1Ru/TiO2 via spectroscopic measurements. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in situ DRIFTS spectra were collected during NH3 adsorption and desorption processes at 200 °C—the same temperature as the amination reaction conducted in this study. The adsorption IR peaks at 3330 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 are assigned to stretching and deformation vibrations of the NH bond in gaseous or physically adsorbed NH3 molecules [77], respectively, which diminished immediately during the purging process (light green line). In comparison, the stretching mode of the NH bond for adsorbed NH3 molecules or NH x species at 3255 cm−1 (dark green line) decreased slowly during the desorption process. One reversed peak at 1890 cm−1 ascribing to Ru-H species was clearly observed when NH3 molecules were introduced onto the surface of the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst [77,78]. This fact indicates the residual Ru-H species after pretreatment (Figure S9) can be easily replaced by adsorbed NH x species, consistent with previous findings that a considerable coverage of NH x species was preserved in the presence of high pressure of H2 [79]. It should be noted that these chemically adsorbed species are mostly located on the Ru nanoparticles since the intensity of the N–H stretching at 3255 cm−1 was very weak on the bare TiO2 support (Figure S10). Consistent with the emergence of surface NH x * species, deformation vibrations for the dissociated NH2* (1592 cm−1) and NH* (1540 cm−1) moieties and corresponding HRu vibrations (1810 cm−1 for the linear mode; 1430 cm−1 for the bridged mode)[77] were observed in the adsorption and desorption processes (Fig. 3A). These in situ DRIFTS results confirm the presence of at least two NH x * species (i.e. NH2* and NH*) on the surface of Ru nanoparticles under the reaction temperature, which are formed from the sequential dissociation of NH3 as illustrated in Fig. 3B. To further differentiate the kinetic behavior of dehydrogenation and reductive amination steps, the surface of the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst was firstly pre-treated with NH3 at 200 °C, and then the physically adsorbed NH3 molecules were removed under a continuous H2 flow. The presence of the dissociated NH2* under the H2 atmosphere was confirmed by the detectable signal at 1592 cm−1, as well as the reversed Ru-H signal induced by the replacement with the NH x species (Figure S11). Subsequently, in situ DRIFTS spectra were collected after the injection of 1 μL iso-propanol or acetone into the reaction chamber. The evolution of adsorption bands centered at 2970 and 1575 cm−1 was monitored as a function of time (Figure S12), which represented the surface concentrations of iso-propanol and generated iso-propylamine/di-isopropylamine products (Table S4) owing to the linear correlation between the KubelkaMunk intensity and the coverage of surface species [58]. For a fair comparison, the intensity of the NH vibration was normalized by the corresponding highest values for the CH adsorption on 1Ru/TiO2. As shown in Fig. 4 A, two inflection points at about t1 = 300 s and t2 = 460 s were observed, which appears to correspond to the C-H stretching from iso-propanol and acetone, respectively. The time delay (Δt, Δt = t (N-H) t iso-propanol) between reaching the peak of C-H stretching for iso-propanol (t1 = 300 s) and the N-H adsorption bands (t 3 = 570 s) was long (270 s). In sharp contrast, the evolutions for the intensity of the two examined adsorption bands on the same catalyst demonstrated a much smaller Δt value of 30 s when acetone was injected (Fig. 4B), indicative of fast reactions between acetone and the adsorbed NH3 molecules. The time delay difference indicates that the dehydrogenation of iso-propanol in the presence of NH3 is the key step in the amination process on 1Ru/TiO2, consistent with kinetic results measured from the fixed-bed reactor. Next, we examined the potential roles of the interaction between NH3-derived surface species and iso-propanol in the dehydrogenation reaction on Ru nanoparticles by in situ DRIFTS. After introducing 1 μL iso-propanol onto the surface of 1Ru/TiO2 pretreated in pulsed NH3 flow at 200 °C, an apparent redshift from 3254 to 3237 cm−1 was observed in the initial stage for the NH stretching vibration of the adsorbed NH3 and its derived species (Fig. 5 A). Subsequently, this IR band returned to its original position, demonstrating reversible interaction between iso-propanol and the adsorbed NH3-derived surface species. The signal intensity of these dissociated NH x * species was integrated and contrasted with the degree of activity enhancement (α) for iso-propanol dehydrogenation on 1Ru/TiO2, which is defined as (4) α = r w N H 3 - r w / o N H 3 r w / o N H 3 × 100 % where r w N H 3 and r w / o N H 3 are the measured reaction rates of iso-propanol dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of NH3, respectively (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the intensity of NH2 Ru IR absorption at 1592 cm−1 gradually increased as the temperature increased from 30 to 200 °C, reflecting the dissociation of NH3 species on Ru surface was favorable at high temperature. This temperature-dependence of the IR band intensity for the NH2* species is in good agreement with the recorded activity enhancement in iso-propanol dehydrogenation. These observations suggest that NH3 plausibly promotes the Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenation step in the form of dissociated species (NH x , x ≤ 2), rather than in the molecular form. The correlation between the size of Ru nanoparticles and the promoting effect of ammonia was further investigated over several catalysts bearing Ru nanoparticles with different diameters. The average sizes of Ru particles after the amination reaction are determined by the statistical results from the TEM images (Figure S2, S13 and S14). As shown in Fig. 6 a, the initial conversions for iso-propanol dehydrogenation without ammonia were controlled within a comparable range (10–20%) via tuning the space velocity. When the reaction rates are normalized by the number of surface Ru sites (Figure S15), the dehydrogenation rates remain nearly unchanged with increasing Ru particle size, indicating that all surface Ru may contribute to the dehydrogenation reaction. When ammonia was supplied, the three Ru/TiO2 catalysts with different Ru particle sizes showed a similar enhanced extent (67–75%) for activity."
10,Theoretical assessment on the role of surface NHx species for alcohol Dehydrogenation.,"3.4 Theoretical assessment on the role of surface NHx species for alcohol Dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations were applied to elucidate the role of dissociated NH x species in promoting the dehydrogenation step on 1Ru/TiO2. Alcohol dehydrogenation to carbonyl compound can undergo via two possible pathways depending on the cleavage sequence of the α-C–H and O–H bonds. Specifically, the alkyl pathway involves the α-C–H bond activation as the first step that yields a hydroxyl-substituted alkyl intermediate, whereas the alkoxy pathway involes the initial activation of the OH bond that leads to the formation of an alkoxy intermediate. DFT calculation for iso-propanol dehydrogenation on a Ru(0001) model surface indicates that both pathways were kinetically limited by the cleavage of the OH bond, which exhibits the highest activation barrier along the reaction path (Figure S16). Moreover, the OH cleavage transition state involved in the alkoxy pathway is energetically more stable than that in the alkyl pathway (52.3 vs. 64.6 kJ/mol, Figure S16), implying that the alkoxy pathway prevails over the latter for Ru-catalyzed iso-propanol dehydrogenation. Consistent with this finding, a recent theoretical study showed that the rate-determining step for CH3OH amination on Ru surface was the OH bond cleavage in the alcohol reactant [27]. From above, Ru atoms on the (0001) facet are intrinsically not highly active for alcohol conversion due to its high barrier in OH cleavage, in full agreement with literature findings on several other catalytic systems. For instance, Bell and coworkers found that atoms at the perimeter of the metal-support interface in the Ni/HAP catalysts were the main active sites for propanol dehydrogenation [41], reflecting the crucial role of the interface for activating alcohols. In another study, Shimizu et al. showed that the edge/corner sites of Ni particles were much more active for cyclodecancol dehydrogenation than those located on flat surfaces [2]. As revealed from the in-situ DRIFTS spectroscopy (Fig. 3A), NH2* is the predominant form of the dissociated NH x species bound to the surface of the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst. DFT calculations showed that while the hydrogen in OH group is abstracted by the Ru sites on the bare Ru(0001) surface (Fig. 7 A and 7B,), the activation of the OH bond in iso-propanol is promoted by the presence of co-adsorbed NH2* species on Ru, in which the barrier for the formation of NH2* from NH3 is 113 kJ/mol (Figure S17). The nucleophilic NH2* species acts as an active site to abstract the electrophilic H atom of the OH group (Fig. 7C). In contrast, the co-adsorbed NH x species cannot assist the CH scission based on our DFT results (Figure S18), consistent with previous findings [52]. This new route of the OH bond cleavage brought forth by the co-adsorbed NH2* surface species significantly lowered the corresponding activation barrier compared to the case of a bare Ru surface (8.0 vs. 26.7 kJ/mol), providing a rationale for the promoting effect of ammonia on the dehydrogenation ability of 1Ru/TiO2 observed experimentally (Fig. 2D)."
11,Comparison of catalytic performance between 1Ru/TiO2 and 1Pd/TiO2 for alcohol amination.,"3.5 Comparison of catalytic performance between 1Ru/TiO2 and 1Pd/TiO2 for alcohol amination. In general, metallic Pd has high dehydrogenation activity [80], and Pd-based catalysts have also been applied for direct amination of alcohol in batch reactors [21–23,81,82]. 1Pd/TiO2 was thus chosen as a reference catalyst to unveil whether the observed promoting effect of NH3 is unique to Ru. 1Pd/TiO2 was prepared following the same method as 1Ru/TiO2. The Pd nanoparticles possess comparable size distribution with Ru nanoparticles (2.9 ± 0.6 nm for 1Pd/TiO2 vs. 2.7 ± 0.8 nm for 1Ru/TiO2, Figure S19), and the Pd species are confirmed to stay in the metallic state (Figure S20 and S21). The exposed fraction (n) of surface Pd atoms is determined to be 0.43 according to the equation: n = 0.90d −0.7 [73], where d is the averaged size of Pd nanoparticles. Similar to 1Ru/TiO2, 1Pd/TiO2 showed high efficiency for iso-propanol dehydrogenation in the absence of ammonia (Figure S22 and Table 2 ). However, the reaction rate (r) of iso-propanol on 1Pd/TiO2 substantially decreased from 0.11 to 0.08 mol/molPd/s once ammonia was switched on, which is in line with the previous finding [45,52]. No detectable NH x species are observed during the adsorption and desorption process on the surface of 1Pd/TiO2 catalyst (Figure S23), in agreement with the findings that the NHx species are the origin of the observed activity enhancement over the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst. The negative influence of ammonia on the catalytic activity of 1Pd/TiO2 indicates that the role of ammonia during alcohol dehydrogenation is metal-sensitive. It is also notable that the selectivity of the targeted iso-propylamine product over the 1Ru/TiO2 catalyst outperformed that over the 1Pd/TiO2 catalyst (85% vs. 56%, Table 1 and 2), leading to iso-propylamine yield obtained on the former almost four times larger than that on 1Pd/TiO2 (60% vs. 13%, Table 1). A similar trend for the two catalysts was also observed over acetone amination with ammonia as shown in Figure S24. The adsorption behavior of relevant species on the surface of reference 1Pd/TiO2 was then studied by in situ DRIFTS technique (Figure S25). Distinct from that of 1Ru/TiO2, the appearance of the signal for iso-propylamine/di-isopropylamine (1575 cm−1) was much slower than that for iso-propanol (2965 cm−1, Δt: 500 s on 1Pd/TiO2 vs 120 s on 1Ru/TiO2), indicating that the conversion efficiency from the pulsed iso-propanol to amines is faster on 1Ru/TiO2 than 1Pd/TiO2, consistent with their activity difference measured from the fixed-bed reactor. It also implies that the desorption of amines from the Pd surface is slower than that from Ru, likely due to its significant selectivity for the heavier di-isopropylamine product that is more difficult to desorb (Table 2). As expected, the difference in Δt after injecting pulsed acetone between the 1Ru/TiO2 and 1Pd/TiO2 catalysts is insignificant (30 vs. 60 s, Fig. 8 A and 8B), in line with the fact that the dehydrogenation step is kinetically more relevant in iso-propanol amination on both catalysts. Our in-situ DRIFTS results highlight that the reduced activity of 1Pd/TiO2 in the presence of ammonia is probably due to severe inhibition of the Pd surface by the slow desorption rate of generated di-isopropylamine species (Table 1 and 2). The superiority of the adsorption ability for the Ru-based catalyst was supported by the DFT calculations, which shows the adsorption energy for iso-propylamine via the N-coordination to the Ru and Pd surface are −154 and −125 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure S26). Previous work on amination revealed a positive correlation between the adsorption energy of the N-atom on the catalyst surface and the selectivity towards the primary amine product [27]. In our work, the moderately stronger N adsorption energy on the Ru surface hints at a high barrier for breaking the N-surface bond to form an additional CN bond (e.g., form di-isopropylamine). In contrast, the relatively lower N adsorption energy for 1Pd/TiO2 leads to the significant formation of di-isopropylamine as a side product (Tables 1 and 2)."
12,Conclusion:,"Although previous studies have highlighted the synergistic effect between metal and the support for alcohol dehydrogenation, few studies have paid attention to the effects of dissociated NH x species on the surface of the metal catalyst during alcohol amination. In this work, the promotional effect of ammonia on the rate-controlling dehydrogenation step has been identified over 1Ru/TiO2 for the gas-phase amination of iso-propanol. On basis of the kinetic and in situ DRIFTS results, the superior catalytic performance of 1Ru/TiO2 in alcohol amination, as compared with the referenced 1Pd/TiO2 catalyst, lies in two aspects. First, Ru has the ability to dissociate ammonia into NH x (x = 1, 2) species, which synergistically promote alcohol activation on the Ru surface via providing a more efficient pathway to cleave the OH bond of the alcohol reactant for dehydrogenation. Second, the moderately strong amine adsorption energy via N-coordination on Ru sites inhibits the excessive CN coupling towards the production of undesired diamines, without compromising the desorption kinetics of the primary amine. This work deepens the understanding of the renowned advantages of Ru-based catalysts in alcohol amination reaction and also sheds light on the potential promoting/inhibiting effects of ammonia in heterogeneous catalysis when used as a reagent."
