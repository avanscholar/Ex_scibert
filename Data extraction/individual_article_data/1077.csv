0,Introduction,"The demand for bioplastics has been recently increasing as an alternative to conventional plastics, due to their renewability, non-toxicity, degradability, and biocompatibility, with comparable mechanical properties to their fossil-based counterparts [1]. Bioplastics are derived from renewable resources, such as cellulose, lignin, starch, sugar, and other carbohydrate sources [2]. A sharp increase in their consumption rates, however, has led to the agglomeration of post-consumer wastes, as their degradability can be achieved only in specific conditions [3]. Additionally, the production of these plastics consumes higher energy than that of recycling their wastes. Recycling of these post-consumer products is therefore considered a more effective and sustainable way to handle the products at their end-of-life stage, especially by converting them to value-added starting materials for other processes [4,5]. Among these, bio-based polyols are promising products, which can be obtained from the conversion of various bioplastic wastes, such as polylactide (PLA), polyurethanes, polyglycolide, and polycaprolactone. PLA is an aliphatic polyester derived from its lactic acid monomer or lactide dimer [6]. The polymer has been used in many applications, such as food and non-food packaging, drug-controlled release, agriculture, and accessories of automotive and electronic devices. PLA is also used in biomedical applications, such as orthopedic implants and sutures for bond fixation. Lactic acid, the monomer of PLA, is synthesized from carbohydrate sources through fermentation processes in the presence of specific microorganisms or bacteria [7,8]. Low molecular weight PLA can be prepared by the direct polycondensation (DP) of lactic acid. In contrast, high molecular weight PLA is produced via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of its lactide dimer in the presence of a catalyst [9–11]. The molecular weight has strong effects on the properties of PLA, leading to different applications. For example in medical devices, medium or small-sized PLA is commonly used for drug loading, drug delivery, and drug nanoparticle encapsulation to achieve high compatibility with human cells and tunable degradation behavior [12,13]. In contrast, high molecular weight PLA is typically employed as degradable packaging, 3D-printing filaments, mulch films, implants, and sutures with good mechanical properties. Bio-based polyols are widely used as starting materials for various biopolymers, especially polyurethanes (PU), by reacting with diisocyanate precursors [14,15]. Bio-based polyols can be prepared either by polymerization of small molecules or chemical recycling of biopolymer wastes through hydrolysis or alcoholysis reactions. Biodegradable PLA-based polyols with different structures and molecular weights have been derived from renewable agricultural sources [16]. Direct polycondensation (DP) and ring-opening polymerization (ROP) are employed for preparing PLA-based polyols by adding di-, tri-, or poly-hydroxyl alcohols as core structures or terminating agents [17,18]. Several alcohols, e.g., ethylene glycol [19], 1,4-butanediol [20,21], 1,8-octanediol [17], pentaerythritol [22,23], diethylene glycol (DEG) [24], poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [18,25], poly(tetramethylene glycol) [26], have been employed for preparing low molecular weight prepolymers of PLA-based polyols. Chemical recycling of PLA post-consumer wastes through alcoholysis is a facile depolymerization method to generate PLA-based polyols [27]. Several alcohols have been employed in the alcoholysis reaction, such as ethanol, butanol [28], ethylene glycol (EG) [29,30], 1,3-propanediol (PDO), 1,4-butandiol (BDO) [31], glycerol, and dipentaerythritol [32]. In this process, temperatures, pressures, and catalyst loading are important parameters to control the efficiency of the depolymerization reaction. The alcoholysis of PLA is typically conducted at its melting temperature in non-catalyst systems, or at temperatures higher than 100 °C in the presence of a catalyst, to achieve high conversion yields [33]. Several heating techniques can be employed, such as an oil bath, autoclave, or microwave reactor. A microwave reactor can be effectively employed for step-growth polymerization of PLA [34,35] and in the depolymerization reaction [28]. The major benefits of this heating source are the enhancement of the reaction efficiency and sensitivity, with precise control of the temperature and pressure. Additionally, a catalyst plays a key role in promoting the depolymerization of PLA with alcohols, by increasing the reaction rate and efficiency of ester-bond cleavage. The alcoholysis or transesterification of PLA with various alcohols, i.e., ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, glycerol, erythritol, poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) [36], and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) [37], were conducted by using tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBT) as a catalyst. In our previous work, a process for alcoholysis of PLA by various linear diols, which possess only primary hydroxyl groups, but different numbers of methylene groups in the molecule, was developed [38]. The reaction was conducted in a presence of a TBT catalyst using a microwave reactor. Effect of the methylene length of the diols on the reaction efficiency and properties of the products was examined. The resulting alcoholyzed PLA products with tunable sizes and structures were characterized and used as macromolecular diols in the preparation of value-added polyurethanes (PUs). In this work, the effects of the nature of hydroxyls, i.e., primary and secondary OH, branched/linear structures, and the number of hydroxyl groups in the alcohol molecules on the efficiency of the chemical recycling process of PLA and properties of the resulting products are investigated. The alcoholysis process for PLA is developed by utilizing different alcohols consisting of three carbons, i.e., propylene glycol (PG), 1,3-propanediol (PDO), and glycerol. The effects of alcohol types and PLA/alcohol feed ratios on the structures and yields of the products are examined by varying the feed ratio at a fixed TBT catalyst amount. Most importantly, standard techniques for characterization and quantitative analysis of the resulting PLA alcoholyzed products are developed by 2D-NMR (HMQC and HMBC), 1H NMR, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Important parameters, in terms of product compositions, chemical structural fractions, and conversion yields, can be obtained from the techniques, leading to insights into the reaction mechanisms. Potential applications of the alcoholyzed PLA products as polyols starting materials in the production of degradable PUs, which possess self-healing properties, are assessed and compared with those from the use of linear diols in our previous study. The self-healing mechanism at different temperatures is examined under microscope, and the mechanical properties before and after the heat treatments are investigated."
1,Experimental,

Propylene glycol (PG) (99.5%) and 1,3-propanediol (PDO) (98%) were supplied by Carlo Erba and Acros Organics, respectively. Glycerol (Gly) (99.5%) was purchased from Quality Reagent Chemical (QRëC®). 1,4-butanediol (BDO) (>99%) and 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI) (>99%) were supplied by Acros Organics. Tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBT) (97%) catalyst was supplied by Fluka. Stannous octoate (SnOct2) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. The toluene solvent (>99.8%) was purchased from Carlo Erba. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Alcoholysis of PLA,"2.2 Alcoholysis of PLA The alcoholysis of PLA was conducted by using a microwave reactor (Discover SP series, CEM Matthews NC, USA). The reactor utilizes irradiation of 2.455 GHz with 200 W of power. The reactor was equipped with an 80 mL vessel tube, a pressure monitoring system, and a fiber-optic temperature probe. The effects of alcohol types and their feeding contents on the chemical structures and properties of the alcoholyzed products were examined. Alcohols with three carbons in the molecule but different structures and numbers of hydroxyl groups (PG, PDO, and Gly) were used. The PLA/alcohol feed ratios were varied from 1:1 to 9:1 and 20:1 wt/wt, at a fixed TBT catalyst content of 2 wt% of PLA. The alcoholysis reaction was conducted at 240 °C, under a pressure of lower than 250 PSI for 10 min. The overall experimental conditions are summarized in Supplemental Table S1."
4,Preparation of PLA-based polyurethanes (PU),"2.3 Preparation of PLA-based polyurethanes (PU) The alcoholyzed product from a PLA/PG ratio of 6:1 wt/wt (coded as LPGT61) was selected as a suitable polyol to react with HDI, catalyzed by SnOct2, in the production of PLA-based PUs. The PU preparation was performed according to the procedures, as previously reported [38]. The alcoholyzed product (12 g) and SnOct2 catalyst (60 mg or 0.5 wt%) were dissolved in toluene (80 mL) and stirred at 90 °C. HDI (0.0309 mol) was then added to the mixture. After 30 min of reaction, a pre-calculated amount (0.0062 mol) of the BDO chain extender was added, and the mixture was continuously stirred for 5 h to complete the reaction. Different PU products prepared with and without the chain extender were obtained, as coded by PUT5/1 and PUT5, respectively."
5,Characterization of alcoholyzed PLA and PU products,"2.4 Characterization of alcoholyzed PLA and PU products The alcoholyzed PLA products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode on a Nicolet iS5 spectrometer. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker 500 Ultrashield Plus) was employed for quantitative analysis of the product compositions and yields. Two-dimensional NMR (2D-NMR), based on heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bond coherence (HMBC) techniques, were employed for structural elucidations and signal assignments. The experiments were conducted on an Ascend TM 600 Bruker spectrometer. The alcoholyzed PLA products were analyzed by employing Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (GC Agilent 7890A and MS Agilent 5975C). The GC conditions were optimized by using headspace parameter (Agilent 7697A), DB-5HT column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.1 μm), fused silica transfer line, and an average velocity of 36.3 cm/sec. The GC column temperature was initially fixed at 50 °C for 5 min, which was subsequently increased to 190 °C at 5 °C/min, and 280 °C at 20 °C/min. The injection temperature was set at 280 °C, with a split mode (a split ratio 50:1 and a 50 mL/min flow rate) and a helium gas carrier (1 mL/min) under a pressure of 7 psi. The MS measurement was conducted at 230 °C by observing the m/z range of 35–750. The resulting PU products were prepared in a sheet form by a CT compression molding machine (PR2D-W300L300 HD-WCL, hydraulic system). The samples were preheated at 120 °C for 10 min, and then compressed at 120 °C, with a pressure of 2000 PSI for 5 min. The films were then cut to 75 × 10 mm2 for tensile tests by employing a Tinius Olsen H5KT tensile machine. The measurements were conducted at a fixed crosshead speed of 20 mm/min. At least 5 specimens were measured for each PU sample, and the average values of tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at break were reported. Owing to its optimum properties, PUT5 was chosen as a candidate for examining of self-healing property. The PUT5 sheets were prepared into a specimen size of 60 × 5 mm2. The specimen was then knife cut at the middle with a diameter of 2 mm, at room temperature. The healing behavior was examined by heating the specimens at 40 and 60 °C in a hot-air oven, whose surface was observed by a microscope at 1, 2, and 5 h. The tensile properties of the samples before and after the healing experiment was also investigated by employing a Tinius Olsen H5KT tensile machine, at a fixed crosshead speed of 20 mm/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,ATR-FTIR spectroscopy,"3.1 ATR-FTIR spectroscopy Various alcohols that have three carbon sequences, i.e., PG, PDO, and Gly, are applied in the depolymerization of PLA. FTIR spectroscopy is employed in the characterization of the alcoholyzed products, in comparison with their respective starting alcohols. Depending on the degree of depolymerization, a mixture of hydroxyl-capped lactate sequences with different lengths is obtained as alcoholyzed PLA products, as summarized in Scheme 1 . These are classified as mono-lactate, dilactate, and poly-lactate, corresponding to x values of 1, 2, and more than 2, respectively. To compare the lactide-cleaving efficiency of each alcohols and the reactivity of different OH groups, i.e., primary and secondary hydroxyls, the compositions of the products with different structures were examined. When only one primary hydroxyl is reacted, structure (A) is obtained for all systems, whereas structure (A1) is generated when the other secondary hydroxyl is reacted in LPGTxx. When all OH groups (two or three) are reacted, structure (C) is generated. In addition, structure (B) is observed in LGlyTxx, when both primary hydroxyls are reacted. The spectra of the original alcohols are compared in Fig. 1 . The hydroxyl (O-H) stretching mode of PG is observed at 3313 cm−1. The C-H vibrational modes are located at 2970–2876 cm−1. The bands of ras(CH3), νas(CCO), νs(CCO), and ν(C-C) are observed at 1135, 1076, 1037, and 922 cm−1, respectively. The bands of δ(OH) at 1331 and 990 cm−1, and ν(CCO) (or referred to as C-OH) at 837 cm−1 are used to indicate the hydroxyl contents and confirm the equivalence point of the reaction between PG and the ester bonds of PLA. For PDO, a broad band of ν(OH) is at 3293 cm−1. The bands of νas(CCO), νs(CCO), δ(OH), and ν(C-OH) are observed at 1055, 1034, 983, and 920 cm−1, respectively. The corresponding ν(OH) band of glycerol (Gly) is at 3279 cm−1. The νas(CCO), νs(CCO), and ν(C-C) bands are located at 1108, 1029, and 922 cm−1, respectively. The bands of δ(OH) at 1326 and 993 cm−1 and ν(CCO) at 850 cm−1 are also used to confirm the equivalence point of the reaction between Gly and the ester bonds of PLA. The alcoholyzed PLA products obtained from the reactions with PG, PDO, and Gly at different feed ratios are coded as LPGTxx, LPDOTxx, and LGlyTxx, respectively, and the ATR-FTIR spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2 . All products show the characteristic bands of C-H vibrational modes at similar regions to those of the original alcohols, with an addition of the νas(CH3) band of PLA at 2977–2989 cm−1. For the LPGTxx system, the bands of δas(CH3) at 1452 cm−1, δs(CH3) at 1381 cm−1, δ(CH) at 1266 cm−1, ras(CH3) at 1124 cm−1, ν(C-CH3) at 1042 cm−1, ν(COO) at 864 cm−1, and δ(CO) at 754 cm−1 are observed. FTIR spectra of LPGTxx products obtained from PLA/PG ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 wt/wt are compared in Fig. 2(a). The OH stretching band is observed at 3387–3468 cm−1, which is higher than that of pure PG. The band further shifts to a higher frequency when the PLA/PG ratio was increased, indicating the formation of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding between free OH groups of unreacted PG, and OH terminals and carbonyl (CO) of the lactate products. At a PLA/PG feed ratio of 4:1, the product has high molecular weight and viscosity, but a low content of OH groups. As a result, the OH band is observed at a higher frequency (lower degree of hydrogen bonding) than those from the ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. This hydrogen bonding formation also leads to a shift to lower frequency of the CO stretching band to 1734–1741 cm−1, than that of neat PLA. FTIR spectra of LPDOTxx, as shown in Fig. 2(b), indicate that similar changes are observed for the ν(OH) and ν(CO) modes. LPDOT11 shows the ν(OH) and ν(CO) bands at 3356 and 1731 cm−1, whereas those of LPDOT41 are at a higher frequency of 3477 and 1736 cm−1, respectively. Similar changes of the ν(OH) and ν(CO) bands are also observed for LGlyTxx, as shown in Fig. 2(c). LGlyT11 has the bands of ν(OH) and ν(CO) at 3353 and 1734 cm−1, while those of LGlyT41 are observed at 3447 and 1740 cm−1, respectively. ATR-FTIR spectra are also used for quantitative analysis and examining the reaction mechanisms by comparing the intensities of the δ(OH) and ν(CCO) bands of free hydroxyls of PG, PDO, and Gly. These bands disappear when the PLA/alcohol reaction reaches its equivalence point. LPGT11 shows that unreacted PG remains in the product mixture, reflected by the existence of the bands of δ(OH) at 1328 cm−1, νas(CCO) at 1076 cm−1, δ(OH) at 995 cm−1, and ν(CCO) at 836 cm−1. These bands, however, tend to disappear when a PLA/PG ratio of 4:1 is employed. For LPDOT11, unreacted PDO is reflected by the bands of νas(CCO) at 1070 cm−1, δ(OH) at 977 cm−1, and ν(CCO) at 920 cm−1. These bands are eliminated when the PLA/PDO ratio is increased to 4:1, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The spectrum of LGlyT11, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c), shows bands of unreacted Gly: δ(OH) at 1330 cm−1, δ(OH) at 988 cm−1, and ν(CCO) at 850 cm−1. These bands disappeared in the spectrum of LGlyT41. FTIR spectra of all products are compared, as a function of alcohol types and the PLA/alcohol feed ratios, in Fig. 3 . Additional information is obtained from changes in the intensity of ester bands. The intensities of the νas(COO) at 1186 cm−1, νs(COO) at 1086 cm−1, and ν(COO) at 864 cm−1 bands increase with an increase in the ratio from 1:1 to 20:1 wt/wt, indicating a higher degree of ester bond formation/remaining in the products."
8,FTIR quantitative analysis,"3.2 FTIR quantitative analysis Apart from the transesterification products by the three alcohols, the presence of lactide is also observed in the product mixtures, reflected by its characteristic ester band at 935 cm−1 [39], as shown in Fig. 3(i). The band intensity increases with an increase in the PLA/alcohol ratio for all alcoholysis systems, indicating an increase in the lactide contents. To obtain insights into this lactide formation mechanism, a standard FTIR technique for quantitative analysis of the content has been used, as shown in Fig. 3(ii). A curve-fitting procedure was applied to determine the lactide band area, which was then normalized against that of the reference band at 1451 cm−1 for comparison across samples. A standard curve was constructed from the values obtained from the spectra of standard samples, prepared by mixing exact amounts of lactide with PLA matrix in chloroform solvent at 0 to 16.3 wt%. The mixtures were then cast on a glass slide, followed by drying to obtain film products for FTIR measurements. The results of the lactide contents as a function of the type of alcohol and the PLA/alcohol feed ratios are summarized in Fig. 3(iii). An increase in the lactide content with an increase in the feed ratio is observed. Lactide dimer is commonly generated from the back-biting reaction of lactate oligomers on the hydroxyl terminal side. The effectiveness of the reaction is dependent on the depolymerization temperature, and type and content of catalyst, and chain length of the lactate oligomers [40–44]. At high PLA/alcohol feed ratios, a lower amount of alcohol ensures higher contents of products with lactate’s hydroxyl terminals and moderate chain lengths. This leads to a higher degree of the back-biting reaction and lactide formation. The degree of lactide formation is also dependent on the chemical structures of the alcohol reagents. At the same PLA/alcohol ratio, the order of lactide contents is as follows: LPDOTxx > LPGTxx > LGlyTxx. This indicates that the linear alcohol, i.e., PDO, has higher efficiency in the depolymerization of PLA to generate optimum-sized lactate oligomers for lactide formation, compared to those of the secondary hydroxyls of PG and Gly. Insights into chemical structures and interactions of the alcoholyzed products can be obtained from FTIR band frequencies and their changes. The degree of band shift in the characteristic O-H and CO stretching modes are examined, as shown in Supplemental Figure S1 and summarized in Fig. 4 (i)-(ii). The bands shifted from low to a higher frequency, when the PLA/alcohol ratios were increased from 1:1 to 20:1 wt/wt. The products from the feed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 show the OH band with high intensity but located at low frequency, indicating the presence of high contents of hydroxyls, which leads to a high degree of hydrogen bonding. In contrast, the hydrogen bonding is weakened with an increase in the PLA/alcohol ratio, reflected by the lower intensity of the band and the shift to a higher frequency (closer to that of the free OH stretching mode). Additionally, the CO stretching band shifted to a lower frequency at higher OH contents, indicating stronger hydrogen bonding between CO and OH groups. At PLA/alcohol ratios of 1:1 and 2:1, the high OH contents of the products are reflected by a lower intensity of the CO band. This leads to a higher probability of hydrogen bonding with hydroxyls and stronger interactions, reflected by a shift of the band to lower frequencies. The reverse trend was observed in the product obtained at a ratio of 20:1. FTIR spectroscopy is employed for examining the reaction mechanisms and quantitatively determining the equivalence PLA/alcohol ratio, where the alcohols are completely reacted with PLA. The areas of the ester (COO) and the unreacted alcohols (CCO) bands were determined by a curve-fitting technique, as shown in Supplemental Figure S2. The resulting values were also normalized to that of the reference δas(CH3) band at 1451 cm−1 for quantitative comparison across samples. The normalized values for all products are plotted as a function of the PLA/alcohol ratio, as shown in Fig. 4(iii)-(iv). In the LPGTxx system, the value of the unreacted PG band at 1073 cm−1 became 0 at a ratio of 4:1 wt/wt, indicating the equivalence point. The corresponding equivalence point of LPDOTxx and LGlyTxx systems was observed at 3:1 and 2:1 wt/wt, respectively. In addition, the normalized values of the two modes observed at different feed ratios indicate the content of ester bond formation as a result of the transesterification of PLA by each alcohol and the remaining unreacted alcohols in this system. The technique can also be applied to monitor the content of free alcohols and the extent of the transesterification reaction as a function of reaction time in a specific system, to elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of the reaction."
9,2D-NMR spectroscopy,"3.3 2D-NMR spectroscopy As the alcoholysis reaction of PLA yields a mixture of products with different chemical structures, compositions, and molecular weights, comprehensive assignments of their NMR signals are essential in the elucidation of their structures and compositions. 2D-NMR spectroscopy is employed, in which the heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) spectra provide details on the direct-attachment 1H–13C coupling. The heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) detects long-range correlation of two- and three-bond couplings. The HMQC and HMBC maps of LPGT31 products are shown in Fig. 5 , and the overall signal assignments are summarized in Supplemental Table S2. The products consist of three possible chemical structures of (A), (C), and (A1). Different numbers and types of hydroxyls of PG undergo the transesterification reaction and connect with lactate sequences. For each structure, the number of lactate repeating units also varies, i.e., mono-lactate, dilactate (or called lactyllactate), and poly-lactate. In addition, a side reaction between butoxide groups of the TBT catalyst and lactate sequences of PLA (called LA-Cat) was also observed, reflected by the signals of Cat-CH3 and Cat-CH2. Chemical structures of the products are therefore examined by using key signals, (h1, g1, e1), (h, g, e), and (h2, g2, e2), assigned to those of structures (A), (C), and (A1), respectively. The corresponding HMQC and HMBC plots of LPDOT31 products are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S3, while the signal assignments are summarized and discussed in Supplemental Table S3. LPDOT31 is composed of two possible products, i.e., structures (A) and (C), according to the number of reacted hydroxyls of PDO with lactate sequences of PLA, as shown in Fig. 6 (i). In contrast, LGlyT31 consists of products with three possible chemical structures, i.e., structures (A), (B), and (C), as illustrated in Fig. 6(ii). The signals assignment are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S4 and summarized in Supplemental Table S4."
10,Reaction mechanisms by 1H NMR quantitative analysis,"3.4 Reaction mechanisms by 1H NMR quantitative analysis The comprehensive signal assignments obtained from 2D-NMR spectroscopy are employed in the quantitative analysis of the samples using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The spectra of LPGTxx, LPDOTxx, and LGlyTxx samples at PLA/alcohol ratios of 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S5–7. The compositions of these products were calculated by using the integrals of the methyl signals of lactate units by the following equations: % mono - lactate = b 2 × 100 / b 1 + b 2 + b % dilactate = b 1 × 100 / b 1 + b 2 + b % poly - lactate = b × 100 / b 1 + b 2 + b The results on average lactate lengths and the structural compositions of the mixed products as a function of the alcohol type and PLA/alcohol feed ratios are summarized in Fig. 7 and Supplemental Table S5. The weight ratios were converted to molar feed ratios, to compare the results across different alcohol systems. At the same feed composition, the mono-lactate contents of LPDOTxx was higher than that of LPGTxx. Similar results were observed for the lactyllactate or dilactate content, while the reverse trend was obtained for the poly-lactate content. PDO consists of only primary hydroxyls on both ends while PG contains one primary and one secondary hydroxyl. This indicates that the primary hydroxyl possesses higher reactivity towards the transesterification, which leads to higher efficiency in converting PLA chains to small-sized lactate products. This is also confirmed by the structural yield results, in which the contents of structure (A) of LPGTxx is higher than that of structure (A1). The content of structure (C) of LPDOTxx, generated when both hydroxyls undergo the alcoholysis reaction and form ester bonds with lactate sequences, is higher than those of LPGTxx at all feed compositions. This indicates the higher reactivity of the primary hydroxyl. The smallest mono-lactate is a major product for all systems, indicating that the process being developed (using a microwave reactor) has high efficiency in the cleaving of ester bonds in long PLA chains (also at short reaction times). The yield of this mono-lactate can be varied by changing the types of alcohols and the PLA/alcohol feed ratios, to achieve products with desired lengths. The mono-lactate content decreases when the feed ratios were changed from 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt, while those of dilactate and poly-lactate increase. Similarly, structure (A) is a major product at high alcohol feed contents, as there is an excess number of hydroxyls in the system. When the alcohol feed content is decreased, however, the deficit ratio forces all free hydroxyls to react with ester bonds and generate more structure (C) products. At the same PLA/alcohol ratios, the conversion yields of mono-lactate, dilactate, and poly-lactate produced from different alcohols varied, due to their differences in reactivity (nucleophilicity) and functionality. PDO, a linear diol (functionality of two, both primary OH groups), possesses high nucleophilicity and the highest reactivity, leading to the highest PDO-lactate and structure (C) contents. PG has similar functionality (two) to PDO, but low nucleophilicity, as one of the hydroxyls is on a secondary carbon. As a result, PG shows lower reactivity. Gly has two primary and one secondary hydroxyl (functionality > 2), but lower nucleophilicity than those of PDO and PG. Also, Gly is bulkier than PG and PDO, especially after some of its hydroxyls have reacted with ester bonds. This impedes further reactions for breaking the lactate sequences into smaller-sized structures. The insights into these reaction mechanisms, especially the effects of alcohol types and the PLA/alcohol feed contents, are essential in determining the reaction conditions for effectively designing a process to obtain the alcoholyzed products with specific structures and properties for further use in specific applications."
11,GC–MS analysis,"3.5 GC–MS analysis The chromatograms of the alcoholyzed PLA products obtained from a feed ratio of 4:1 are compared in Supplemental Figure S8. As the products consist of different lactate segments connected to the alcohols, these are eluted at different retention times. The signals of mono-lactate, dilactate, trilactate, tetralactate, and pentalactate are classified by their corresponding mass spectra (MS), as illustrated in Supplemental Figure S10, with the proposed fragmentation ions in Supplemental Figure S9. In LPGT41 system, the values of m/z from 43, 45, 59, and 61 are observed for non-reacted and reacted PG. A presence of lactide is indicated by the fragment-ions (m/z) at 43, 45, and 56. The lactate segments are ionized into m/z of 43, 45, 56, 73, 89, 100, 128, 145, 161, and 217 [45–48]. The lactate sequences with longer than 2 units are reflected by the m/z values of 145, 161, and 217. When PG, PDO, or glycerol are bonded with various lactate sequences, the fragment-ions are observed at the m/z of 118, 130, 135, 163, 173, 189, and 202. It is noted that a signal of lactic acid was observed in all samples, likely because of partial depolymerization and hydrolysis of the products in the capillary column of GC at high temperature (280 °C). The results on compositions of the alcoholyzed products, as summarized in Table 1 , are in good agreement with those observed from FTIR and NMR measurements, with additional information on the classification of trilactate, tetralactate and pentalactate. However, the information on structures A, B, or C cannot be derived from GC–MS measurements."
12,Reparation of PLA-based polyurethanes,"3.6 Reparation of PLA-based polyurethanes The potential use of the resulting alcoholyzed PLA products as value-added starting materials (polyols) for the preparation of PLA-based PUs is demonstrated. LPGT61 was selected as a suitable polyol to react with HDI for the synthesis of highly-elastic PUs. FTIR spectra of the starting LPGT61 polyol and the resulting PU films prepared with and without BDO chain extender, coded as PUT5/1 and PUT5, are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The reaction between hydroxyl (OH) and isocyanate (NCO) groups formed urethane groups (NHCOO). The N-H stretching mode of amine was observed at 3398 and 3330 cm−1 [38,49]. The carbonyl (CO) vibration modes are located at 1749 cm−1 (lactate sequences) and 1708 cm−1 (urethane groups). The bending characteristic bands of (NH) (referred to as (CNH)) and the (CN) stretching modes of non-cyclic urethane groups were observed at 1526 cm−1 [38]. The mechanical properties of the compressed PU films were examined by employing tensile tests, as illustrated in Supplemental Figure S11 and summarized in Table 2 . Interestingly, the materials show a modulus of lower than 10 MPa, which is much lower than neat PLA. This indicates the rubbery nature of the material. Remarkable improvement in the toughness was achieved, as indicated by the high value of elongation at break (624%) for PUT5. A further increase in the value to 893% was observed when the BDO chain extender was introduced (PUT5/1). Given their excellent toughness and ester constituents, the PLA-based PUs are promising candidates for use as toughening additives for other degradable polyesters, especially PLA. In addition, the resulting PUs show unique shape-memory and self-healing properties, enabling their use as functional materials in various specific applications."
13,Self-healing property,"3.7 Self-healing property Shelf-healing properties of PUT5 at different temperatures, i.e., 40 and 60 °C were investigated by varying the healing time from 1, 2, and 5 h, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . The healing rate of the lactide-based PU films at 60 °C are faster than that at 40 °C, due to higher mobility of chain segmental rearrangement. The healing efficiency of this PUT5 increases when the healing time was extended from 1 to 5 h or longer. The mechanical property of PUT5 films before and after healing test was examined, as summarized in Table 3 and Supplemental Figure S12. The original PUT5 has high flexibility with 0.54 MPa tensile strength, 3.39 MPa modulus, and high elongation at break (1120%). Significantly, the tensile strength and modulus are improved, while the elongation at break was decreased when the samples were healed at temperature of 40 °C and 60 °C. Interestingly, these tensile strength and modulus increased along with increasing in healing time of 1 h, 2 h, and 5 h. In contrast, the elongation at break of those samples decreased as a function of time. Among of 40 °C and 60 °C, the healing mechanism at temperature of 60 °C is faster than 40 °C. In addition, the mechanical property of healing samples at 60 °C is enhanced better than those of samples at 40 °C, except elongation at break. This is because of this temperature is not only affected on H-bonding formation, but also improved on polymer chain rearrangement, crystallization, and hardness."
14,Conclusions,"A microwave-assisted alcoholysis process for chemical recycling of PLA by using different alcohols with three C atoms in the structures, i.e., propylene glycol (PG), 1,3-propanediol (PDO), and glycerol (Gly), has been successfully developed. This process can be used for converting PLA wastes into small value-added hydroxyl-capped products. Standard techniques for quantitative analysis of the product’s chemical structures and compositions have been developed to gain insights into the reaction mechanisms by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The PLA/alcohol equivalence point of LPGTxx, LPDOTxx, and LGlyTxx systems are observed at 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 wt/wt, respectively. 2D-NMR results indicated that all alcoholyzed PLA products consist of mono-lactate, dilactate, and poly-lactate, as the main components. The quantitative analysis results from 1H NMR and GC–MS indicate that mono-lactate contents decreased with an increase in the PLA/alcohol ratios from 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt. In contrast, the contents of dilactate and poly-lactate increased when the feed ratios were increased. Insights into the reaction mechanisms, in terms of the reactivity of different hydroxyls, were derived from the results on compositions of the products with different structures, i.e., (A), (B), and (C). Additionally, lactide was also obtained from the reaction, and the lactide content was also strongly dependent on the feed ratios. A potential use of the resulting alcoholyzed PLA products as value-added starting materials (polyols) was demonstrated in the preparation of PLA-based PUs. The PU products show unique properties for use as toughening agents for other polyesters or as functional polymeric materials. This PU products have excellent self-healing property, especially by heat treating at 60 °C. Additionally, further enhancements in the tensile strength and modulus are observed after the heat-treatment process. Although PLA is degradable and can be derived from renewable resources, the chemical recycling process offers additional advantages in reducing the need for new raw materials and help in management of its post-consumer wastes. This aligns well with the concept of circular economy for sustainable development."
