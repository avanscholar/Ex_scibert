0,Introduction,"Several biological methods can produce H2 with minimal energy requirements [1]. During the last two decades, mixed culture dark anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates to produce H2 has been studied extensively and has been shown to be economical, immediately potential and industrially feasible [2]. It could combine waste reduction with high H2 production rate and use the same hardware of the industrial methane (CH4) fermentation [3,4]. Almost all of the studies reported on H2 production via the dark fermentation focused on characterizing and optimizing substrates, reactor designs, culture pre-treatments, and operational parameters. However, most of these studies used short-term and fast laboratory operations. A missing evaluation criterion was the inevitable H2 consumption occurring during dark fermentation which persistently resulted in low H2 yields. Generally, the H2 yields varied between 0.57 and 2.8 mol H2 mol−1 hexose [2,5] out of 4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose (i.e., the maximum biologically possible yield during mixed culture dark fermentation). It is plausible to argue that even if 4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose is produced during fermentation, the H2 consuming reactions will determine the final yield of H2. In anaerobic digestion, reduced organic substrates are degraded and converted into CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) by a series of biochemical reactions through the metabolic interactions of physiologically unique groups of anaerobic microorganisms (Fig. 1 ). The major stages of degradation are hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis; they occur synergistically in a successive fashion such that a product of one reaction becomes a substrate for the next reaction. These stages are performed by four trophically-distinct groups of microorganisms working in a balanced symbiotic relationship [8] to share the energy derived from the reduced organic substrate [9]. The major groups of microorganisms and their metabolic roles are [10]: 1) Hydrolytic and fermentative (acidogenic) bacteria hydrolyze and ferment organic substrates to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) with production or consumption of H2, 2) Acetogenic bacteria convert the VFAs into acetate and H2, 3) Methanogenic archaea (both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic convert acetate and H2/CO2 into CH4, respectively), and 4) Homoacetogenic bacteria convert H2/CO2 into acetate. Acetogenesis must be distinguished from homoacetogenesis. Acetogenesis is acetate production by heterotrophic microorganisms through oxidation of organic acids such as propionic, butyric, valeric acids and alcohols [11]. Homoacetogenesis, on the other hand, is acetate formation by autotrophic acetogenic microorganisms (homoacetogens) through CO2 reduction with H2. Although both acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis produce acetate, the former produces H2 and CO2 as well while the latter consumes H2 and CO2 [12]. Homoacetogens are acetogens which shift their metabolism, under stress conditions or after depletion of the reduced organic substrate, to autotrophic growth on H2/CO2. However, it must be noticed that not all acetogens are homoacetogens. The difference between acetogens and homoacetogens is a trophic or metabolic condition rather than phylogenetic. Acetogens grow slowly in a syntrophic relationship with methanogens to maintain a low hydrogen partial pressure P H 2 (<10 Pa). Homoacetogens share with acetogens their ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions [13,14]. However, homoacetogens grow on H2/CO2 faster than acetogens on organic substrate. Moreover, homoacetogens do not depend on the activity of methanogens because they are not inhibited by high P H 2 . These characteristics give homoacetogens advantages over acetogens under stress conditions. The fact that not all acetogens are homoacetogens should focus the research towards finding potential methods which control the latter while enhancing the former during H2 fermentation. Homoacetogenesis has been reported in mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic dark fermentative H2 production [15–18]. However, its quantification, extent, trigger, and control have not been investigated sufficiently. Homoacetogenic and acetogenic bacteria have received less attention [19,20] than acidogens and methanogens, especially in H2 production studies [15]. Not many studies have focused on the metabolism of homoacetogens during H2 fermentation [21]. Almost all of the published studies focused on diverting the electron flux from CH4 towards H2; now the research goal should be preventing homoactogens from consuming the pool of H2. Results reported in the literature suggest that homoacetogenesis is underestimated though it might occur all the time during H2 dark fermentation. This review focuses on the homoacetogenic H2 consumption during H2 production through dark fermentation in non-methanogenic mixed cultures."
1,Mixed cultures dark fermentation,"Mixed culture dark fermentation is a natural process evolved to maximize the cell growth but not the H2 yield [22]. The by-products (H2, VFAs and alcohols) are ultimately converted into CH4. In balanced mixed culture fermentation, H2 is produced through hydrogenases activity as an intermediate by-product accompanying acetate and butyrate formation (Fig. 2 ) [22]. Interspecies H2 transfer in mixed anaerobic culture follows many pathways as long as the reactions are thermodynamically favorable [23]. Unless inhibited, hydrogenotrophic methanogens consume H2 to produce CH4 and maintain low P H 2 . Theoretically, when H2 consuming microorganisms are completely inhibited, H2 would accumulate to a maximum of 4 or 2 mol mol−1 glucose if acetate or butyrate (Table 1 ; Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively) is the only final reduced product, respectively. Acetate formation is preferred because it regenerates the reducing equivalents and allows the microorganism to synthesize ATP [23]; however, under elevated P H 2 (>60 Pa) butyrate is produced to avoid the accumulation of inhibitory reducing equivalents [7]. Reactions producing reduced by-products, biomass synthesis, and extracellular electron transfer (molecular H2 consumption by homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens) compete for electron equivalents released during pyruvate oxidation [24]. Therefore, the formation of reduced by-products decreases H2 yield (Fig. 2). By-products distribution depends on the environmental conditions, such as pH, P H 2 , microorganisms species, and substrate concentration [25–27]."
2,Hydrogen consuming reactions and microorganisms during mixed culture H2 dark fermentation,"Anaerobic consortia from open environmental sources contain H2 consuming microorganisms. Methanogens, sulfate-, nitrate- and iron-reducing bacteria, and propionate-, lactate-, butyrate- valerate- and caproate- (Table 1; Eqs. (3), (4), (7)–(11)) and alcohols-producing bacteria consume H2 as electron donor and decrease its yields during mixed culture dark fermentation [7,28,29]. Hydrogen could be consumed in two forms: as reducing equivalents (NADH2; potential H2) and as molecular hydrogen (H2). Consumption of NADH2 prevents formation of Fdred and formate which both lead to H2 formation [24]. Bioreactions producing VFAs such as lactate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and caproate (Eqs. (3), (4), (7)–(11); Table 1) and alcohols (ethanol and propanol) consume NADH2 as electron donor (Fig. 2) [29,30]. Lactate is the preferred substrate for propionate-forming bacteria [31] and these two reactions are thermodynamically favorable (negative Δ G 0 ′ ) (Eq. (24) and Eq. (25)). Hence, they consume NADH2 and prevent formation of Fdred and formate which both lead to H2 formation [24]. (24) Pyruvate + NADH → Lactate + NAD + Δ G 0 ′ = − 200.0 kJ mol − 1 (25) Lactate + NADH → Propionate + NA D + Δ G 0 ′ = 13.8 kJ mol On the other hand, acetate and CH4 formation by homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, respectively, consumes molecular H2 (Table 1, Eqs. (16) and (17)) [7]. Valeric and caproic acids formation reactions (Eqs. (8) and (11)) from propionate and butyrate, respectively, consume 6 mol of H2 each; these two reactions are thermodynamically favorable at pH < 4.0 [32]. Hydrogen could also be consumed during the conversion of ethanol to acetic acid (Table 1; Eq. (15)) [33] which is thermodynamically favorable at high P H 2 . Obviously, except acetate formation from pyruvate most of the acidogenic reactions are exclusively or partially H2 consuming. Notice that 7 out of the 11 of the acidogenic reactions in Table 1 consume H2. For example, the reactions Eqs. (3), (4), (8)–(11) in Table 1 are exclusively H2 consuming acidogenic reactions. To increase the H2 yield, H2 consuming microorganisms and reactions must be eliminated or reliably inhibited [34]. Usually, the fermentation medium is designed to eliminate electron acceptors (sulfate, nitrate, and iron) which use H2 as an electron donor [28]. However, headspace CO2 cannot be eliminated; thus homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens reduce it with H2 (electron donor) to acetate and CH4, respectively, (Table 1, Eqs. (16) and (17)). Based on the theoretical trophic model of anaerobic digestion suggested by McInerney and Bryant [10], inhibition of methanogenesis activates homoacetogenesis or solventogenesis. Inhibitors affect specific or several groups of the anaerobic consortium and cause unbalanced kinetic condition between acidogens, acetogens, and methanogens. Therefore, inhibitors alter the electron flux exchanged amongst these microorganisms. The inhibition of acetogens causes accumulation of VFAs while the inhibition of methanogens causes the accumulation of acetate and H2. Acidogens usually respond to VFAs accumulation by shifting their metabolism from acetate to more reduced by-products such as propionate, butyrate, or lactate, or from VFAs to alcohols production. The accumulation of reduced by-products (lactate, isopropyl alcohol, and butyl alcohol) was reported to associate with low H2 yield [24]. Many reports concluded that 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA) inhibits methanogens, does not affect acetogens, and enhances homoacetogens [35,36]. The major H2-consuming microorganism other than hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens are reviewed in the following sections."
3,Lactic acid bacteria,"3.1 Lactic acid bacteria Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are common in H2 dark fermentation. Species such as Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus ferintoshensis and Enterococcus durans secret bacteriocins which inhibit H2 production in batch [37,38] and continuous reactors [39]. The H2 yield was reduced by 31% when lactic acid increased from 2.3 to 4.4 g l−1 [40]. Temperatures above 50 °C were proposed to prevent the effects of LAB [38]; thus they cannot be limited in mesophilic cultures [40]. LAB such as Bacillus racemilacticus and Bacillus myxolacticus were reported in heat-treated culture [40]. Moreover, LAB were reported to dominate during high organic loading [41]."
4,Propionic and butyric acid bacteria,"3.2 Propionic and butyric acid bacteria Clostridia species such as Clostridium propionicum produce mainly propionate. Similar to LAB, propionate producing bacteria were reported to dominate during stress condition such as high organic loading [41]."
5,Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB),"3.3 Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) Some SRB, such as Desulfomicrobium, Desulfobulbus and Desulfobotulus perform fermentative and proton-reducing acetogenic reactions in addition to sulfate reduction [42]. In the absence of sulfate, SRB grow through an interspecies H2 transfer by substrate-level phosphorylation [43] with the Desulfococcus, Desulfosarcina, and Desulfobotulus groups being very competitive for H2 [42]. Desulfovibrio-like bacterium dominates even in the absence of sulfate from the growth medium [44]. Zhang and Noike [43] measured high levels of SRB in an anaerobic continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) under sulfate-limiting condition. This is likely because many SRB grow on a variety of fermentative by-products as electron donors while using the low concentration of sulfate as an electron acceptor. Desulfotomaculum geothermicum, a spore forming H2 consuming SRB, was detected in a thermophilic acidogenic culture, whereas Thermotogales strain was detected in a mesophilic acidogenic culture [45]. Short HRT as low as 2 h does not inhibit SRB, but pH values lower than 6 significantly inhibit their activity [46,47]."
6,Homoacetogenic microorganisms,"3.4 Homoacetogenic microorganisms Homoacetogens are strict anaerobes, fast growing with some being spore-forming microorganisms [20] which are phylogenetically diverse and trophically very versatile [33,48]. Homoacetogenic bacteria belonging to Acetobacterium, Butyribacterium, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Sporomusa were widely reported [49]. Table 2 lists some of the homoacetogenic bacteria reported in anaerobic digestion. High levels of homoacetogens were reported in anaerobic digesters [43,59]. They are facultatively hydrogenotrophic [60]; grow autotrophically on H2/CO2 or carbon monoxide (CO) and/or heterotrophically on organic compounds such as sugars, alcohols, methoxylated aromatic compounds, methanol, formate, fumaerate, and 2, 3-butanediol as sources of energy and carbon [49,61]. They produce acetate [12,19], lactose, succinate [49], and ethanol [62]. However, they dominate when H2 is available [61]. Their phylogenetic diversity, metabolic versatility [48] and multitrophy (ability to switch between various substrates or to use them simultaneously) enable them to persist and compete for H2 in any anaerobic environments such as anaerobic digesters, landfills, sediments, soil, termite hindgut, and human gut [36,48,61,63,64]. Homoacetogens may oxidize or synthesize acetate depending on the external H2 concentration [64]. They compete with hydrogeotrophic methanogens for H2 at low pH [48,65]. At high P H 2 (>500 Pa), homoacetogenesis is favored [66]. Clostridium and Acetobacterium sp. are the most common autotrophic and heterotrophic homoacetogenic genera [67]. Clostridium aceticum and Acetobacterium woodii are the two mesophilic homoacetogenic bacteria isolated from sewage sludge [13]. Clostridium scatologenes, homoacetogenic bacteria, was detected in mesophilic reactor at initial pH of 7 and 5.5 [52,54]. Clostridium thermoaceticum grows on H2/CO2 or 100% CO with doubling times of 16 and 18 h at 55 °C, respectively [68]. A. woodii and other members of the genus Acetobacteriium produce and utilize ethanol [61]. Homoacetogenesis was observed and homoacetogenic bacteria were isolated from a wide array of natural environments such as lakes, oceans, the GI tract of human, animals and termites, rice paddy soils, hypersaline waters, surface soils, and deep subsurface sediments [18]. In these environments, homoacetogens compete with hydrogeotrophic methanogens, but interact syntropically with acetoclastic methanogens. Homoacetogenesis is preferred over methanogenesis in termites and animals because acetate is beneficial to the host as energy source while CH4 is a waste product. However, the extent of acetate production varied from system to system. For example, homoacetogenesis was found to produce 10% of the acetate in paddy soil slurries [69], and increased to 40% when acetoclastic methanogenesis was inhibited [70]. Bernalier et al. [36] showed that inhibiting methanogens using BESA activated human gut homoacetogenic bacteria to increase total acetate production by 34% compared to control. Although the role of homoacetogens in H2 dark fermentation is important it is still not clear [67]. Voolapalli and Stuckey [71] showed that during a nutrient deficient shock homoacetogenic bacteria dominated, and severely decreased the H2 yield. Research on acetogenic/homoacetogenic bacteria has been facing some challenges. First, syntrophs are relatively fastidious microorganisms and require the presence of methanogens during their cultivation and maintenance. Second, the oxygen-sensitivity of the enzymes involved in acetogenic and homoacetogenic metabolic pathways requires strict anaerobic conditions. Moreover, acetate formed during the oxidative pathway cannot be differentiated from that formed during the reductive pathway unless radioactive labeled substrates and mass spectrophotometry are used."
7,Biochemistry of homoacetogenesis,"Homoacetogens can convert hexose exclusively to 3 mol of acetate. However, 2 mol of acetate are produced through the oxidative pathway (oxidation of pyruvate to acetate; Box B in Fig. 3 ) with the production of 8 mol of reducing equivalents and 2 mol of CO2. The third mol of acetate is produced through the reductive pathway (i.e., the acetyl-CoA or Wood-Ljungdahl pathway where CO2 is reduced with H2; Box C in Fig. 3) [33,72,73]. The oxidative pathway begins with the oxidation of hexose to pyruvate which, in turn, is oxidized by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxacetyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, reduced ferredoxin, and CO2. The oxidative pathway is usually preferred because it yields 4 mol of ATP (Fig. 3; Box A and B). The 8 reducing equivalents generated via glycolysis (Box A in Fig. 3) and pyruvate:ferredoxin-oxidoreductase (Box B in Fig. 3) are oxidized by reducing 2 mol of CO2 to form the third mol of acetate through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (Fig. 3; Box C). The oxidative pathway maintains the redox balance and allows the synthesis of 1 or 2 mol of ATP thus supports the growth of microorganisms [33,72,73]. The Wood-Ljungdahl (acetyl-CoA or carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH)) pathway is composed of two linear branches; the methyl branch which forms the methyl group of acetate and the carbonyl branch which forms the carboxyl group [33,63,72]. The methyl branch starts by consuming 2 mol of reducing equivalents to reduce CO2 to formate by formate dehydrogenase. The methyl group is synthesized through a series of reactions, which use formate and reduced C1 intermediates, catalyzed by several enzymes. The synthesis of the methyl group consumes 6 mol of reducing equivalents [55,73]. The carbonyl branch starts with the reduction of 1 mol of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) by the action of CODH; this step consumes 2 mol of reducing equivalents [73]. The methyl group and the CO are converted into Acetyl-CoA which is ultimately either converted into acetate with ATP synthesis (energy conservation) during catabolism or to cell carbon during anabolism [20,40,63]. Acetogenic bacteria can synthesis acetate during heterotrophic growth on variety of substrates. Stoichiometrically, synotrophic acetogens form 1 mol of acetate during their growth on 1 mol of propionate, lactate or ethanol (Table 1; Eqs. (12), (14) and (15)); while 1 mol of butyrate yields 2 mol of acetate (Table 1;). These reactions produce H2 as well; 2 mol of H2 are produced per mol of butyrate, lactate or ethanol (Table 1; Eqs. (13), (14) and (15)) while propionate yields 3 mol of H2. However, except the acetogenesis from lactate, the other reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable (positive ΔG) particularly under the high P H 2 and accumulation of VFAs during H2 fermentation; notice that the homoacetogenic reaction (Table 1; Eq. (16)) is thermodynamically favorable under these conditions."
8,Kinetics of homoacetogenic bacteria,"A wide variation of the maximum specific activity of H2 consuming microorganisms in mixed anaerobic cultures has been reported (Table 3 ); it ranged from 1.9 to 90 g COD g−1 VSS d−1 [74]. Homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens are kinetically comparable, therefore; when the latter are inhibited, the former can replace them as H2 consumers. For example, mesophilic homoacetogens growing on H2/CO2 have a specific growth rate of 0.4–1.9 day−1; a growth yield of 0.35–0.85 g dry weight g−1 H2; and specific substrate utilization rate of 1.4 mg H2 g−1 min−1 [19]. Notice the Gibb's free energy changes for hydrogenotrophic methanogenic and homoacetogenic reactions are comparable (Table 1; Eqs. (17) and (16), respectively). A maximum homoacetogenic H2 consumption rate of 28.5 ± 1.7 kg COD kg−1 COD day−1 with a H2 uptake affinity constant of 3.7 × 10−5 ± 3.1 × 10−6 kg COD m−3 were reported [76]. The homoacetogenic H2 consumption rate was around 11% of the overall H2 consumption rate in anaerobic mixed culture [81]. Dinamarca et al. [82] reported that the rate of homoacetogenic H2 consumption in heat treated batch anaerobic cultures ranged between 4 and 62 mmol H2 l−1 sludge d−1 and was influenced by acetate concentration, headspace P H 2 , history of inoculum, and mass transfer rates. The H2 consumption rate has been measured using externally injected H2 which has to dissolve before being available to microorganisms. In comparison, H2 produced within the culture during fermentation is already dissolved in the liquid pool and is accessible to microorganisms. It appears that H2 supplied through the headspace is more slowly consumed than that produced in the reactor [82]. Therefore, the maximum H2 consumption rate could be much greater than the measured rate because of mass transfer limitations [82]. More accurate methods are required to determine H2 consumption rates by autotrophic bacteria during H2 fermentation. Because no standard laboratory test is agreed upon for measuring the activity of the biomass, each laboratory adopts its own procedure [75,83–86] and this might have contributed to the large variation in the reported values. Kinetically, homoacetogens have the potential to compete with other microorganisms (sugar-, butyrate-, and propionate-degrading organisms) in H2 dark fermentation [76]. For example, homoacetogens grow faster than butyrate- and propionate-degrading acetogens because their affinity to H2 is higher when compared to the affinity of acetogens to propionate and butyrate [76]. Although homoacetogens growing on H2 have the same biomass yield as that of acidogens and acetogens (0.07 kg COD kg−1 COD) their decay rate (0.015 day−1) is slower than that of acidogens and acetogens (0.02 day−1) [76]. Thus, they might have an advantage over acidogens and acetogens in systems with long solids retention time (SRT). Lack of competition between homoacetogens and methanogens or SRB in H2 producing dark fermentation, high concentrations of H2, and the rapid growth of homoacetogens (doubling times of 1.75–29 h under favorable conditions) enable them to dominate in late stages of H2 production in batch [43,84,87] and continuous cultures with long HTR."
9,Hydrogen consumption by homoacetogens during H2 dark fermentation,"Contradictory conclusions have been drawn regarding the existence, extent, dynamics, and prevention of homoacetogenic H2 consumption during H2 dark fermentation. For example, Kraemer and Bagley [83] reported that homoacetogenesis accounts for 2–11% of the decrease in H2 yield and concluded that its effect is minor in continuous fermentative H2 producing bioreactors. Similarly, Ryan et al. [67] stated that homoacetogenesis is not important in H2 fermentation because they observed lag-phases of 60–100 h in homoacetogenic H2 consumption during batch test. Conversely, Oh et al. [84] observed a lag phase of 70 h in homoacetogenic H2 consumption in the first batch test and did not consider homoacetogenesis as unimportant. The different conclusions are likely due to differences in the operational and experimental conditions. Generally, several reports showed that homoacetogenesis decreased the H2 yield significantly in batch and continuous H2 producing reactors with inhibited methanogenesis [73,75–77,80–82,84,87–95]. Luo et al. [54] reported that neither methanogenesis nor homoacetogenesis were observed at thermophilic conditions with initial pH 5.5. Although short-term effects of the pre-treatment were reported to inhibit methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis and increase H2 yields [96] several reports showed that after repeated pre-treatments the mixed cultures consume H2 and its yield decreases [54]. For example, Saady et al. [97] reported H2 yield of 3.1 mol mol−1 glucose during 4 days' incubation of batch mixed anaerobic culture inhibited by 2 g l−1 linoleic acid, however, the yield dropped to 2.2 mol mol−1 glucose when several cycles of fermentation were repeated with homoacetogenesis being active H2 sink [98]. The H2 formed and peaked after 16–30 h in batch reactors was consumed later within 200 h despite pre-treating the culture by heat shock, acid, chemical inhibitors, and freezing and thawing [53,84,99]. Sung et al. [100] demonstrated, in batch mixed cultures which were repeatedly treated by heat, that homoacetogens lowered H2 pressure and produced acetate in the absence of glucose. Oh et al. [84] reported that H2 produced by heat-treated batch anaerobic mixed culture was consumed after 30 h with no CH4 production. When the previous batch reactors were re-spiked with H2 acetate was produced immediately (no lag phase) and accounted for 108% of the theoretical homoacetogenic stoichiometric yield. Similar observation was reported by Nie et al. [86]. These researchers reported that the H2 yield dropped from 2.53 to 1.86 mol mol−1 sucrose mainly due to homoacetogenesis in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) operating at 16 h HRT and pH of 4.9 [85]. Hydrogen from butyrate degradation reacted immediately with CO2 to form acetate, via homoacetogenesis, in a CSTR operated at 55 °C and 6 days HRT [21]. Similar findings were also reported by Dinamarca [89]. Collectively, the previous studies confirm the inevitable development of homoacetogens and demonstrate their adaptation and persistence in H2 dark fermentation. Quantitatively, homoacetogens consume a significant amount of H2 (Table 4 ). Dinamarca and Bakke [85] observed H2 consumption rates of up to 2 mmol H2 g−1 VSS day−1 in H2 producing batch cultures at 35 °C. Nie et al. [86] reported increasing rates of H2 consumption reaching a maximum of 30 ml h−1 at day 7 of incubation in batch reactors. These researchers also observed that the H2 consumption rate exceeded the H2 production rate after 3 days of incubation. H2 is expected to accumulate only when its production is greater than its consumption. Dinamarca et al. [82] measured a homoacetogenic H2 consumption of 4.4 ± 0.5 mmol H2 l−1 sludge d−1 followed by acetoclastic CH4 production after 550 h of operation in a CSTR. They concluded that simultaneous H2 production and consumption occurred in non-methanogenic fermentation [82]. Homoacetogenic H2 consumption in continuous flow mixed culture reactors has not been consistently confirmed because of difficulties in measurement techniques [104]. Therefore, it was inferred from single or repeated fast batch H2 consumption studies. Homoacetogenesis was observed in mixed cultures from digested dairy manure [21], activated sludge [102], etc. in batch reactors [86] and continuous reactors: CSTR [21,82,85,105,106], UASB [85,107], ASBR [108] and expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB) reactor [15] operating at mesophilic [85,101] and thermophilic conditions [21]. Kargi and Pamukoglu [109] reported homoacetogenesis in heat-treated acidogenic anaerobic culture (boiled for 5 h); H2 was consumed after it peaked during the incubation. Xiao and Liu [110] reported H2 consumption in acid-, alkaline-, thermal- and ultrasond-pre-treated cultures. Therefore, homoactogenesis is independent of the culture source, type of reactor, type of culture pre-treatment, and temperature of operation."
10,Simultaneous H2 production and consumption,"Coexistence of H2 producers and consumers in a continuous flow non-methanogenic mixed culture was suggested by Hassy et al. [91]. Distinguishing simultaneous H2 production from H2 consumption in mixed cultures is experimentally not possible without using radioactive label tracking techniques; therefore separate experiments are usually carried out to establish the H2 consumption quantities and rates [84]. Alternatively, acetate yield was used to infer the occurrence of homoacetogenesis. However, it is still not known whether the homoacetogenic H2 consumption exists during the entire fermentation or only when some microorganisms switch to homoacetogenesis after the substrate is depleted [84]. For example, reported results indicated that homoacetogenesis was triggered only after glucose is depleted [86] and dominated in mixed culture during a nutrient deficient shock [71]. In a well balanced anaerobic digestion process homoacetogenic bacteria favor the heterotrophic growth because it is more energetic and faster than the autotrophic growth [89]. However, during stress conditions due to, for example, chemical inhibitors or the unbalanced metabolic activity of the mixed culture, VFAs accumulate and impose product inhibition on H2 producing bacteria; some of which are homoacetogenic and would shift their metabolism from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth to relieve the effect of inhibition [86,89,107]. A H2 consumption of around 0.4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose (22% of the H2 produced) was reported with evidence of simultaneous H2 production and consumption in a CSTR [89,104]. Dinamarca et al. [83] concluded that simultaneous H2 production and consumption occur in non-methanogenic fermentation; however, it has not been thoroughly investigated, quantified, or modeled in continuous flow mixed culture reactors."
11,Modeling hydrogen consumption in an anaerobic dark fermentation,"The earliest attempt to model H2 consumption during H2 production through the anaerobic dark fermentation was reported by Dinamarca and Bakke [101]. They presented a conceptual modification to an existing model by including H2 consumption mechanisms to predict the H2 yield; however, they did not implement the modified model to experimental data. The mass balance of electrons or metabolic by-products flux including VFAs, alcohols, biomass, and biogas produced and consumed in a metabolic network of common reactions can identify hidden H2 sinks [85] Biohydrogen fermentation has been modeled so far using fixed stoichiometries [25,101,111–114]. Such models are snap shots of instantaneous conditions. Fixed stoichiometries models are not suitable because H2 production depends on dynamic parameters such as pH, P H 2 , and thermodynamic which governs the interspecies H2 transfer. Variable stoichiometry with P H 2 and pH to control the thermodynamic feasibility of biochemical reactions were used to model product formation during fermentation [26,27,115]. These researchers assumed the mixed culture as a single virtual microorganism with a diverse metabolic ability to catalyze the common fermentative pathways with optimum energy exploitation. Chaganti et al. [25] modeled the metabolic flux during H2 fermentation based on fixed stoichiometries and used Rodriguez's universal virtual microorganism. Although the model included H2 consumption by homoacetogenesis, solventogenesis, and methanogenesis it ignored the thermodynamic feasibility. The model did not account for the growth of various trophic groups during fermentation which could affect the thermodynamic favorability of bioreactions. The relative populations (biomass concentrations), the growth kinetic parameters, substrate utilization rates, decay rates, and responses to inhibition have not been accounted for. Homoactogenesis in batch reactors is a non-steady state condition which arises due to inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effects are also dynamic; for example, accumulations of VFAs impose synergistic effects with that of the chemical inhibitors. Even in continuous reactors, homoacetogenesis implies that some of the metabolic abilities of the mixed culture (or the universal single microorganism as assumed by the models) are outcompeted, inhibited, or shifted. For example, at H2 consumers to H2 producers population ratio of 1:5 around 30% of H2 production was consumed by homoacetogens while at a ratio of 4:5 complete loss of net H2 production was observed [82]. Hence, the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the homoacetogenic microorganisms need to be accounted for when modeling H2 producing fermentation. The Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) is a structured model which includes hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis as linked individual steps in anaerobic biodegradation [9]. Recently, Antonopoulou et al. [116] included homoacetogenic H2 consumption in ADM1 and applied it to a continuous H2 fermentation to predict the H2 yields from sweet sorghum extract in a CSTR. They included the concentration of H2 consuming microorganisms and modeled H2 uptake rate by Monod kinetics. Antonopoulou et al. [106] estimated a H2 degradation rate of 3.182 kg COD kg COD−1 d−1."
12,Role of pH in hydrogen production and consumption,"The pH is an important operational and stress factor during fermentative H2 production. It impacts H2-producing and H2-consuming microorganisms. The relative amounts of the main VFAs depend strongly on pH; a pH 4.0 to 5.0 favors propionate production (H2 sink reaction) while pH 6.0 to 7.0 promotes acetate, butyrate, and i-butyrate formation with a transition zone between pH 5.0 and 6.0 [116,117]. Clostridia, for example, produce acid at medium pH and switch to solvent production (H2 sink reactions) at low pH [118]. Generally, optimum H2 yield were reported during operation at low pH. Growth rates of the various trophic groups in anaerobic cultures change with pH. In addition, the pH range for optimal growth is different for each trophic group. For example, acidogens grow optimally at pH 5.9 [119] whereas acetogens, hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens grow optimally at an approximate pH of 7.0 [120]. The changes in pH may cause drastic shifts in the relative numbers and activities of different species in a heterogeneous population [119]. Low pH (<4.0) can inhibit activity of microorganisms in a H2 producing culture [121], for example, no H2 was produced from sucrose at pH 4.0 [122]. During H2 production from glucose by mesophilic batch mixed cultures, Saady and Lalman [103] showed that lowering the pH from 7.6 to 5.0 decreased H2 consumption rate by 33% (from 46 ± 17 to 31 ± 4.8 μmol H2 mg−1 VSS day−1). Low pH can limit H2 consumption by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and SRB [122,123] but not by homoacetogens [54]. Goodwin et al. [124] reported that the H2 turnover rate (k a) and the maximum H2 uptake velocity in mixed cultures were functions of pH. Therefore, operating at low pH levels was considered to inhibit methanogenic activity and produce an inoculum rich in H2-producers. The main limitations of this method are acclimatization and the eventual presence of acidophilic homoacetogenic and methanogenic H2-consuming microorganisms. An increasing number of reports provided evidences on occurrence of methanogenesis under low pH conditions [125,126]. Acidophilic or acidotolerant methanogens were reported [127–130] and methanogenesis was shown to proceed at low pH in continuous H2 fermentation [121,129,131]. For example, Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium can grow and produce CH4 at pH values as low as 4.68 [132,133]. Kotsyurbenko et al. [134] have also reported strong H2-dependent methanogenesis at pH 3.8. The previous evidences collectively preclude pH as a successful means to sustain CH4-free and high H2 yield in long-term operation. Gottschalk [135] concluded that pH variation can affect morphology and cell structure, and consequently flocculation and adhesion phenomena which are important mechanisms in H2 consumption by concentrated mixed cultures. Dense biomass in granules and biofilms allows methanogenesis at low pH [31,133] due to the existence of micro-environments which are different than the bulk liquid phase [85]. Hydrogen yield decreased from 2.0 to 0.4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose within 30 days in a hybrid anaerobic continuous reactor due to increasing homoacetogenesis activity at pH 4–5.5 [85]. Similar findings were reported also by Drake et al. [72]. Vijayaraghavan et al. [136] reported that the accumulation of VFAs and pH < 5.8 shifted the metabolism towards H2 consuming pathways. At low pH homoacetogenic bacteria out-competed hydrogenotrophic methanogens for H2 [61]. Hydrogen consumption and its rate increase with the drop in pH and maturity of cultures in non-methanogenic consortium [54]. Therefore, instantaneous homoacetogenesis is inevitable during H2 production since the optimal pH range for H2 production in continuous fermentation (4.0–5.7) overlaps with that suitable for homoacetogenesis [41,104,136,137]."
13,Methods of decreasing H2 consumption,"Almost all of the studies reported so far focused on inhibiting or eliminating methanogens. Very few reports have focused on homoacetogens. Therefore, little is known about the role of homoacetogenesis during H2 dark fermentation [138,139]. Methods which were applied to minimize H2 consumption and increase the H2 yield included heat [140], acid and alkaline [141], ultrasonic [110], and aeration [141] pre-treatments, as well as the addition of chemical inhibitors such as BESA, chloroform [23], acetylene [142], and long chain fatty acids [97,98,143], maintaining low pH [84], sparging with inert gas [144], increased stirring [145], decreasing the headspace pressure in the reactor [90], removing dissolved gases by immersed membrane [146], reducing the CO2 partial pressure by a chemical CO2 scavenger [90], organic loading rate shock or optimization [147,148], and operating at short HRT [149]."
14,Heat treatment,"10.1 Heat treatment Heat-treatment, applied by means of wet and dry heat, desiccation, boiling, and oven-drying at various temperatures (75–121 °C) for different time periods (15 min–5 h) [109,150], effectively selects spore-forming bacteria and eliminates non-spore forming microorganisms such as methanogens. However, many H2 consuming bacteria are spore formers and survive the heat treatment; In addition to the spore-forming homoacetogenic bacteria (Table 2), acidogenic species such as Propionibacerium (propionate producer) [151], Sporolactobacillus (lactate producer) [152], and Desulfotomaculum (sulfate-reducers) [153] are also spore-formers and consume H2. Moreover, some of the non-spore forming bacteria which could consume H2 or lower its production such as Baceroides and Lactobacillus were detected in heat treated cultures during H2 fermentation [147,154,155]. According to Duangmanee et al. [156], repeated heat-treatments were necessary when the H2 yield declined after one month of continuous operation. Heat treatment does not remove spore-forming homoacetogens and sulfate reducers which survived and consumed H2 [84]. Inhibition of acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria due to elevated P H 2 during the substrate acidification induced homoacetogenesis and increased acetate yield by 300% in heat-treated activated sludge culture compared to the control (no heat treatment) [157]. Oh et al. [41] concluded that heat-treatment was unable to prevent homoacetogenic H2 consumption. Generally, heat pre-treatment alone was either not sufficient or inconsistent in developing a suitable H2-producing microbial consortium [158] because it does not exclusively select H2 producers or eliminate H2 consumers [159]. Furthermore, heat pre-treatment does not remove methanogens completely and they resume their growth when the conditions are favorable [32,84]. Moreover, the full-scale application of heat treatment is technically complicated and questionable [34,160]."
15,Acid and alkaline shocking,"10.2 Acid and alkaline shocking Shocking the inoculum with acid or alkaline for certain time to enhance spore formation has been investigated. Conflicting conclusions have been reported on the effect of acid or base treatment on the long-term operation of H2 fermentation. Kim and Shin [161] reported a maximum yield of 0.87 mol H2 mol−1 hexoseadded during 90 days of continuous flow reactor using base-pre-treated culture. Although the pre-treatment selected for spore-forming Clostridium spp. possible bacterial contamination decreased the H2 yield by performing non-H2-producing acidogenic reactions. Kim and Shin [161] reported that acid-pretreatment had no positive effect on H2 yield. On the contrary, Goud and Mohan [162] concluded that H2 yield during long-term operation of acid-pretreated culture (15.8 mol kg−1 CODconsumed) was higher than that obtained from base-treated culture (9.8 mol kg−1 CODconsumed). Given that the reported substrate degradation rates were 53 and 60% for acid- and alkaline-pre-treated cultures, respectively, then the maximum yields obtained would be equivalent to 1.6 and 1.1 mol H2 mol−1 glucose. Goud and Mohan [162] indicated that the H2 yields dropped after relatively long time of operation (around 140–200 days) due to the establishment of methanogenic activity in the suspended sequence batch reactor; therefore, repeating the acid treatment was required. Moreno-Davila et al. [163] reported 2.11 mmol H2 g−1 CODconsumed (equivalent to 0.41 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) using thermally and acidic-pretreated mixed culture in continuous fixed-bed reactor operated at HRT of 0.4 h. Notice that this is quite low yield since it is reported per the consumed rather than the fed COD. Moreno-Davila et al. [163] concluded that increasing the HRT to 0.8 h decreased the H2 yield to 1.31 mmol H2 g−1 CODconsumed because methanogenic activity was not completely inhibited in the biofilms system. Obviously, the long-term operation studies discussed earlier indicated the inevitable challenge of deteriorating culture stability after the pre-treatment, requirements of repeated treatment to eliminate methanogens which re-establish their activity after long time of operation because of non-steril substrates, and ultimately low yields (around 1.0–2.0 mol H2 mole hexose). No quantitative data have been provided by these studies on the H2 consuming routes and reactions. Acid-treatment of inoculum has only short-term inhibitory effects on homoacetogenesis by temporarily ceasing their microbial growth and activities due to changes in environmental conditions. However, some homoacetogens, particularly the spore formers, readjust to the new conditions and re-establish their activities [54]. Hydrogen consumption and its rate increase with the drop in pH and maturity of cultures in non-methanogenic consortium [54]. Xiao and Liu [110] reported H2 consumption in acid-, alkaline-, thermal- and ultrasound-pretreated cultures."
16,Aeration,"10.3 Aeration Repeated-aeration of anaerobic mixed cultures was used to remove H2 consuming methanogens [164]. However, anaerobic H2 consuming microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and homoacetogens were shown to tolerate transit exposure to O2 in various environments; furthermore, they reduce it to re-establish favorable growth conditions [164,165]. Homoacetogenic bacteria such as S. termitida, Acetonema longum, and Sporomusa sp. strain TmAO3, and A. woodii reduce O2 using H2 [165]."
17,Gas sparging and reduction of headspace pressure,"10.4 Gas sparging and reduction of headspace pressure Sparging with an inert gas (N2, CO2, or Argon), CH4, H2/CO2, and steam was used to increase the yield of H2 [91,144,147,166,167]. Reducing CO2 concentration in the headspace by chemical scavenger (KOH) [90], inert gas sparging, the application of a vacuum, or using a large headspace to decrease H2 and CO2 partial pressure in continuous reactors [83,166–168], providing an organic substrate instead of H2/CO2 in continuous reactors to change thermodynamic favorability [67], and the removal of dissolved gases [91] were claimed to inhibit homoacetogenesis during H2 dark fermentation and slightly increase H2 yield. However, conflicting experimental observations and conclusions regarding the effects of these methods on homoacetogenesis were reported. For example, nitrogen sparging decreased homoacetogenic H2 consumption, increased the yield from 1.3 to 1.9 mol H2 mol−1 glucose, and reduced acetate concentration by 50% compared to the control (without sparging) [91]. Siriwongrungson et al. [21] showed that gas sparging (CO2 20%–N2 80%) reduced the P H 2 and allowed H2 production from butyrate degradation under inhibited methanogenesis in thermophilic continuously fed-tank reactors by making the reaction thermodynamically possible. However, isotope experiments confirmed that H2 produced during butyrate degradation was immediately consumed by homoacetogens to produce acetate [21]. These researchers concluded that homoacetogenesis is a challenge facing H2 production even at lowered P H 2 . In Section 4, it has been described that each of the methyl and carbonyl branches in the reductive pathway starts with 1 mol of CO2. Hence, CO2 scavenging would be the simplest and most cost-effective method. However, scavenging CO2 completely from the headspace during high rate H2 production is not possible and using a chemical CO2-scavenger in continuous reactor is not easy [90]. Moreover, no clear experimental evidence has been published on CO2 scavenging techniques in batch and continuous reactors operating for a long time. Furthermore, limiting CO2 concentration enhanced lactate and succinate production by acetogenic species while supplementing CO2 stopped lactate formation immediately [169]. Further research is required to investigate the change in the metabolic pathways under CO2 scavenging conditions. More research is needed to elucidate the extent and mechanisms involved in H2 consumption by homoacetogens in continuous flow mixed cultures acidogenic reactors [85]."
18,Effects of temperature,"10.5 Effects of temperature H2 yield decreased successively during mesophilic and thermophilic long-term batch fermentation (initial pH 7 and 5.5) using heat, acid, and organic loading shocked mixed culture [54]. These pre-treatments did not inhibit homoacetogenesis permanently; however, Luo et al. [54] claimed that lactate production and homoacetogenic activity were inhibited in thermophilic batch mixed culture with initial pH 5.5. Abreu et al. [15] reported H2 consumption with increased acetate formation and no CH4 during mesophilic (37 °C) but not during thermophilic (55 °C) and hyper-thermophilic (70 °C) H2 production in an EGSB reactor. Conversely, several studies reported that homoacetogens tolerating temperature changes within certain limits, adapt to an optimum temperature, and consume H2 at temperature from 4 to 80 °C [16–18,59]. Kotsopoulos et al. [105] reported homoacetogenic H2 consumption during steady-state condition of H2 production in a CSTR operating at 70 °C. Although temperature higher than 70 °C improved the H2 yields [170,171] heating the reactor to maintain thermophilic and hyper-thermophilic conditions is an energy drain which may limit sustainable H2 applications [82]. At normal conditions of low H2 concentrations in mesophilic methanogenic mixed culture, homoacetogens do not compete hydrogenotrophic methanogens because the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis yields more energy ( Δ G 0 ′ = −135.0 kJ) than homoacetogenesis ( Δ G 0 ′ = −104.0 kJ). However, homoacetogens were reported to outcompete hydrogenotrophic methanogens for H2 at temperatures < 20 °C [14,70] because the latter are less active at such temperatures [172–174]. Fey and Conrad [175] concluded that the portion of the carbon and electron flux passing through homoacetogenesis increases with the decrease of temperature. At temperatures < 10 °C, the total electron flow has passed through homoacetogenesis [176]. Thermodynamic calculations show that at 5 °C with P H 2 < 10 Pa and 10 mM acetate homoacetogenesis yields the same energy as that yielded by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at 35 °C [48]. Psychrophilic and psychrotolerant homoacetogenic bacteria were isolated from many environments [18,174,176,177]. In conclusion, operating H2 fermentation at psychrophilic conditions seems not advisable."
19,Hydraulic and solids retention times (HRT and SRT),"10.6 Hydraulic and solids retention times (HRT and SRT) Short HRT and solids retention time (SRT) in a CSTR were suggested as prerequisites to avoid homoacetogenesis in continuous high rate H2 production [82]. However, short SRT precludes immobilization and concentrated biomass applications which are required for high substrate organic loading rate and increased H2 production per reactor's unit volume. Saady et al. [98] found that LCFAs-inhibited granular cultures consumed more H2 than flocculated/suspended dilute cultures; after 5 days no H2 remained in the batch granular culture compared to an average of 2.2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in the flocculent culture. Oh et al. [41] observed decreasing H2 production with increasing SRT in membrane bioreactor operating at short HRT (3 h). Wu et al. [178] attributed a low H2 yield at long HRT to the activity of homoacetogens. Oh et al. [84] reported H2 loss via homoacetogenesis after 1 day in a batch study. Heyndrickx et al. [181] speculated that long HRTs may enhance homoacetogens to dominate. Homoacetogenic population density decreased when HRT was shortened from 12 to 1.5 h in an anaerobic CSTR, but they were not washed out from the reactor [43]. Generally, the HRT which is optimum for H2 yield (8–20 h) [179–182] overlaps with the doubling time of homoacetogens (1.75–29 h) [43,68,87]. In conclusion, it is difficult to avoid homoacetogenesis by HRT only [21]. Dinamarca and Bakke [85] concluded that significant homoacetogenic H2 consumption increased with biomass density and sludge age (establishment of granules, dense flocs, or biofilms) in the bioreactor. Generally, long retention time promoted faster H2 consumption. Saady et al. [97] reported that the H2 yield in granular cultures was lower than that obtained in flocculated culture. Significant continuous homoacetogenesis decreased the H2 yield from 1.5 to 0.02 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in mature immobilized mixed cultures (granules and biofilms) (HRT 6–40 h; temperature 25–55 °C) [85,89,101]. Apparent H2 consumption was faster with increasing HRT. The H2 yield dropped in a CSTR to less than 0.25 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in 57, 24 and 18 days at HRT of 8, 12 and 17 h, respectively [85]. Dinamarca [89] hypothesized that a syntrophic association of an interspecies electron transfer may exist between H2 producers and non-methanogenic H2 consumers depending on juxtaposition of cells [78,183]. Such juxtapositional structure of cell-to-cell contact establishes micro-environments which induce autotrophic growth because homoacetogens are exposed to higher H2 concentration than in the bulk phase while they are without access to organic feed [85,89]. However, such syntrophic association needs to be verified experimentally and modeled. Homoacetogenesis did not occur in fresh pretreated inocula; however, it increased successively after long-term cultivation of repeatedly pretreated inocula [54]. These researchers reported that H2 consumption in mesophilic mixed anaerobic culture repeatedly pretreated with acid and incubated (5 successive times) was zero, 0.222, 0.556, 0.556, and 0.728 ml H2 g−1 glucose h−1 during the cycles 1 to 5, respectively. Simultaneously, the H2 yield (ml H2 g−1 glucose) decreased from 200 (cycles 1 and 2) to 171 (cycle 3) and then to 156.3 (cycles 4 and 5) [54]. Homoacetogenesis accounted for 5% (cycle 1) and 43% (cycle 5) of the theoretically calculated H2 yield [54]. Similarly, an increasing rate of homoacetogenic H2 consumption (mmol h−1) of 0.33 (cycle 1), 0.56 (cycle 2), and 0.61 (cycle 3) was reported in batch mixed cultures at 25 °C [83]. Although load-shocking have been shown to increase the H2 yield (1.6 mol mol−1 glucose) compared to control (0.4 mol mol−1 glucose) in long-term operation methanogens re-established their activity in an anaerobic sequence batch reactor after around 100 days because of the non-sterile substrate [184]. A repeated shock-load treatment was required to inhibit methongens and increase the yield."
20,Chemical inhibition,"10.7 Chemical inhibition Chemical inhibitors such as BESA, chloroform (CHCl3), and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) were used to inhibit H2 consumption and increase its yield in batch and continuous reactors [23,97,98,143]. Inhibiting methanogens by BESA stimulated homoacetogenesis during short-term (24 h) incubations [36,185,186]. The addition of a homoacetogenic species, Peptostreptococcus productus ATCC 35244, alone did not affect CH4 and VFAs production, but the addition of the same strain with BESA stimulated homoacetogenic H2 consumption [185]. Similarly, homoacetogens produced at least 20–30% of the acetate when the culture in an anaerobic CSTR was inhibited by CHC13 [87]. Under BESA inhibition, a lag phase of 60–100 h was observed before homoacetogenesis [59]. Species of Clostridiales, Actinomycetes, and uncultured Chloroflexi tolerated CHCl3 while Geobacter hydrogenophilus and homoacetogenic Moorella sp. dominated under BESA inhibition which enhanced H2 oxidation [21,23]. Evidence of strong syntrophy between acidogenic and acetogenic H2-producers and homoacetogens when methanogens were inhibited by BESA and CHCl3 was provided by Xu et al. [23]. Inhibiting methanogens by BESA stimulated homoacetogenesis, reduced the P H 2 in headspace, and partially relieved the thermodynamic inhibition of propionate and butyrate-degraders [21,23]. Although long-term exposure to BESA or CHCl3 was reported to inhibit Gram-negative bacteria and SRB [187] no long-term studies were reported on the effect of these inhibitors on H2 production and consumption in mixed cultures [23]. Toxic chemicals may inhibit H2 producers as well; for example, BESA and CHCl3 strongly suppressed Bacteroidetes [23]. Similar finding was reported recently by Saady et al. [143] for lauric acid which inhibited methanogens and most of H2 producing acidogens and diverted the electron flux towards alcohols formation."
21,Summary of the methods investigated to reduce H2 consumption,"10.8 Summary of the methods investigated to reduce H2 consumption The results of studies which compared effects of the methods discussed in Section 10.1–10.7 are presented in Table 5 . Many studies reported that no CH4 was detected in the first batch after various pre-treatment methods (heat, acid, organic load shocking, etc.) [54,99,139]. However, the pretreated culture produced CH4 after long-term cultivation under mesophilic and thermophilic condition irrespective of pre-treatment types [16,21,139,156,162,184]. Heat, acid, and organic loading shock transitionally inhibited but did not kill methanogens (non-spore formers) [140,147,154,156]. Moreover, the re-establishment of methanogenic activity after operating acid-, alkaline-, and shock load pretreated cultures for long time has been reported [162,184]. Under inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, H2 accumulates and induces homoacetogenesis [23] during mesophilic and thermophilic conditions at an initial pH 5.5–7 [139]. These researchers concluded that methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis depended on the fermentation conditions, and not on the pre-treatments used [140,195]. These H2 consuming reactions will dominate even with repeated treatments as the cultures mature. The homoacetogens are more challenging than methanogens since they have more diverse metabolic capabilities and can switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism depending on the availability of substrates [82]. Obviously, none of the pre-treatments eliminated the H2 consumption in long-term batch and continuous operations; this is evident from the H2 yield reported (varied around 2.0 mol mol−1 hexose). In addition, the reported results and conclusions are controversial as to which pre-treatment is the best to maximize H2 yields. Most of the results reported were from a single batch, or a continuous reactor for a short time. Only several studies have been reported on long-term operation of heat-, acid-, base-, and load-shock treated cultures [161–163,184] with conflicting results regarding the effects of acid and base treatment on H2 yield [161,162]. Long-term effects and the evolution of mixed cultures in continuous reactors after pre-treatments are crucial to the development of industrial processes and require more research. Correlating results of batch H2 consumption to continuous reactors is problematic. Reports usually claim enriching H2 producers rather than H2 consumers. It should be noticed that culture pre-treatments (heat, acid, alkali, freezing-thawing, etc) impose stress conditions which select spore forming microorganisms. However, not all spore forming microorganisms are H2 producers nor are all H2 consumers non-spore formers. Therefore, a more accurate term would be “enriching spore formers”. Homoacetogenesis as well as H2 consuming acidogenic reactions (lactate, propionate, valerate, and caproate formation) were observed in cultures enriched with spore-forming microorganisms. With all reports of enriching H2 producers and eliminating H2 consumers (methanogens and homoacetogens) the H2 yield is still around 2 mol mol−1 glucose [2,5]."
22,Thermodynamic control,"Many of the catabolic reactions (Table 1) in energy limited anaerobic systems are thermodynamically controlled [196]. For example, the thermodynamic favorability of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis is a function of H2 concentration. Under low H2 concentrations maintained by methanogens and sulfate reducing bacteria the free-energy change of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis ( Δ G 0 ′ = −135 kJ) is larger than that of homoacetogenesis ( Δ G 0 ′ = −104.0 kJ) [197]. Under the conditions of inhibited methanogenesis, acetate and H2 accumulate and impose product inhibition on acetogenic reactions (Table 1, Eqs. (12)–(16)) which become thermodynamically unfavorable. To relieve the stress condition due to product inhibition, microorganisms switch their metabolism to reactions which are thermodynamically favorable as long as the microorganism poses the required enzymes to catalyze them. Examining Table 1 reveals that H2 consuming acidogenic reactions yield more energy to the microorganism than acetogenic reactions under elevated H2 concentration. Notice that the free energy changes (kJ) for producing propionate (−279.4), lactate (−225.4), ethanol (−164.8), valerate (−143.3), and caproate (−143.3) are thermodynamically more favorable than any of the acetogenic reactions from propionate (+76.2), butyrate (+48.4), lactate (−4.2), ethanol (+9.6). Interestingly, homoacetogenesis is still thermodynamically favorable (−104.0). Thermodynamic favorability appears to be the trigger of homoacetogenesis, hence, thermodynamic could be used to control the operation of H2 fermentation so that homoacetogenesis is avoided. More research is required on the thermodynamic control of homoacetogenesis during H2 production. Particularly, more modeling which incorporates thermodynamic constraints is required to elucidate the dynamic of homoacetogenesis."
23,Future research and potential strategies to reduce the effect of homoacetogenesis,"Assessing the extent and mechanisms involved in homoacetogenic H2 consumption in continuous flow acidogenic reactors producing H2 is required. Radioactive labeling technique could be used to elucidate the homoacetogenesis and the metabolic pathways of H2 consumption during dark fermentative H2 production. Controlling liquid and gas phase CO2 concentration appears to be a promising strategy to control homoacetogenesis during H2 production. However, developing, characterizing, and optimizing simple and cost-effective techniques to reduce CO2 concentrations in batch and continuous reactors need to be investigated. Effects of chemical inhibitors other than BESA and chloroform on homoacetogenic bacteria require further investigation. Regulation of homoacetogenesis at the genetic level, during batch and continuous H2 fermentative dark fermentation, requires further investigation through genetic methods. Inactivation of uptake hydrogenases and blocking of pathways which compete for and consume H2 as well as enhancing of H2 evolving pathways are the strategies for genetic and metabolic engineering research."
24,Conclusions,"The role and activity of the various microorganisms responsible for H2 consumption during dark fermentative H2 production are still not well defined or controlled. Until now there is no adequate means to eliminate H2 consumption in anaerobic mixed culture dark fermentation with homoacetogenic bacteria being more persistent and challenging than methanogens because they are phylogenetically diverse and trophically very versatile. Homoacetogenesis during H2 dark fermentation does not depend on the source of cultures, pre-treatment, inhibition, substrate, or operation conditions. The efficacy of any pre-treatment to eliminate H2 consuming microorganisms in mixed cultures is questionable as the culture mature during long-term operation. Homoacetogenesis consumed from 11% to 43% of the H2 yield in single and repeated batch fermentations, respectively. However, its quantification and extent during continuous fermentation are still not well understood. Models incorporating thermodynamic and kinetic controls are required to provide insight into the dynamic of homoacetogenesis during H2 dark fermentation. Homoacetogenesis occurs through syntrophic interspecies H2 transfer amongst acidogens, acetogens, and homoacetogens; more research is required to investigate this syntrophy in non-methanogenic conditions. Homoacetogenesis is a challenge since it prevails in high biomass densities which are used to increase the H2 yields and production rate. Persistence of homoacetogenic and acidogenic spore-forming H2 consuming microorganisms may eventually exclude anaerobic mixed culture dark fermentation as a stand-alone route for sustainable continuous H2 production from renewable biomass. Controlling CO2 concentration during dark fermentation needs further investigation as a potential strategy towards controlling homoacetogenesis. Incorporating radioactive labeling technique in H2 fermentation research could provide information on simultaneous production and consumption of H2 by homoacetogens."
