0,Introduction,"The interest of developing bio-based films was intensified due to concerns of the limited natural resources, such as fossil fuels, and to reduce the impact of plastics on the environment (Sanches-Silva et al., 2014). In recent years, it is increasingly important to use biopolymers for the fabrication of active packaging films as an alternative to traditional plastic as consumers become more aware and increasingly prefer environmentally friendly packaging films (Atarés & Chiralt, 2016; Cerqueira, Souza, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2012). In this context, various researchers studied the development and application of biopolymer films, based on a variety of agricultural products and/or food waste (Aguirre, Borneo, & León, 2013; Leceta, Guerrero, Cabezudo, & de la Caba, 2013; SA, 2010; Sansone et al., 2014). Bio-based films have an intrinsic property to maintain quality and extend food shelf-life (Aguirre et al., 2013; Elsabee & Abdou, 2013). Several biopolymers such as starch (Fama, Rojas, Goyanes, & Gerschenson, 2005; Malhotra, Keshwani, & Kharkwal, 2015), cellulose derivatives (Dias, Müller, Larotonda, & Laurindo, 2011; El Halal et al., 2015), chitosan (Dash, Chiellini, Ottenbrite, & Chiellini, 2011; Huang, Huang, Huang, & Chen, 2007; Shahid & Mohammad, 2013), gums (Rao, Kanatt, Chawla, & Sharma, 2010; Tripathi & Katiyar, 2016), etc. have been used for various applications. Among these, CS based composite films are useful as bio-packaging material in the form of bioactive films for food preservation (Tharanathan, 2003). Furthermore, the bioactive CS films potentially serve as a vehicle to incorporate and enhance the food value along with other additives such as flavoring, coloring, antioxidant and antimicrobial agents (Fernandes, Freire, Silvestre, Pascoal Neto, & Gandini, 2011). CS, the linear and partly acetylated (1–4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucan, is the main derivative of the natural polymer chitin, the second most abundant natural polysaccharide on the Earth, after cellulose. It exhibits unique properties, such as biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, and biodegradability. Due to its remarkable film-forming ability, associated with its antimicrobial properties, chitosan has wide range of applications, namely in the field of food packaging (Fernandes et al., 2008, 2011), agriculture, drug delivery, wound healing, and pharmaceuticals (Dash et al., 2011). However, poor mechanical properties and high permeability to water vapor limit their industrial use especially in food packaging applications. Physical and barrier properties of chitosan films; important characteristics for food packaging applications (Cerqueira, Souza, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2012; Fernández-Saiz, Sánchez, Soler, Lagaron, & Ocio, 2013; Kurek, Galus, & Debeaufort, 2014) have been improved by blending with PVA. PVA is a water soluble, a synthetic biodegradable polymer with excellent mechanical properties and film forming ability. Blending of CS with PVA has been reported (Chen & Huang, 2016; El-Hefian, Nasef, & Yahaya, 2011; Morariu, Bercea, & Brunchi, 2015; Reddy et al., 2016; Vimala et al., 2011) to improve the mechanical strength and thermal stability, maintaining the intrinsic properties of the CS films (Hajji et al., 2016). Furthermore, the active packaging functional properties of CS/PVA matrix were achieved by adding EV. EV (3-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde) is a synthetic food additive soluble in ethanol. It is widely used as a flavoring agent (Jay & Rivers, 1984; Morris, Khettry, & Seitz, 1979) in foods, beverages and perfumes. This synthetic flavor has more intensive flavoring power compared to vanillin (3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde). As EV is much cheaper, it is used as a substitute for natural vanilla flavor. Since it acts as an antioxidant agent (Tai, Sawano, & Yazama, 2011) it keeps better in storage and transport (Lević et al., 2014; Tomadoni, Ponce, Pereda, & Ansorena, 2019). The incorporation of the active component, EV into the CS/PVA matrix would be an attractive method to prepare films with a good ability to preserve food by extracting the advantages of each component. Several studies on CS/PVA blend films have been reported in the literature (Badgujar, Dhake, & Bhanage, 2013; Chen & Huang, 2016; Hu, Xin, Hu, Chan, & He, 2013; Kumari, Basha, & Sudha, 2012; Liang, Liu, Huang, & Yam, 2009; Merlusca et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Very few studies have been reported in the literature on ethyl vanillin and vanillin. Recently, Lević et al. (2014) investigated the effect of immobilized EV on thermal, morphological and mechanical properties of PVA nanofibrous films. They applied the electrospinning technique for the production of nanofibrous films. Levic et al. (2013) applied electrostatic extrusion to the encapsulation of ethyl vanillin in calcium alginate and calcium alginate/poly(vinyl alcohol) beads and investigated the entrapment of aroma in beads by FTIR and TGA/DTG. CS/vanillin composite films were studied by Zhang, Han, Zeng, Xiong, and Liu (2015), to investigate the effect cross linking agent of vanillin on physicochemical and mechanical properties of CS films. Authors, Kasai, Chougale, Masti, and Narasgoudar (2018) have also studied the influence of equal weight percent of PVA and vanillin on the thermal stability of the CS films. These approaches showed the significant potential of ethyl vanillin and vanillin as a bio-based cross linking agent due to their special structure. EV and vanillin have been successfully incorporated into polymers to form new composite materials with improved physicochemical properties, thermal stability and prolonged shelf life for wide practical applications (Kayaci & Uyar, 2012; Stanzione III, Sadler, La Scala, Reno, & Wool, 2012). Hence, we have selected EV as a cross linking agent to develop CS/PVA/EV active films. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on CS/PVA/EV blend films so far. The objectives of the present work were to develop EV incorporated CS/PVA active films and evaluate the influence of cross linking agent, EV on various ratios of CS/PVA matrix. Mechanical, structural, food compatibility and antibacterial activities of prepared blend films were investigated to assess their applicability in active food packaging."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan with low molecular weight was procured from the Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI Tokyo Japan, the degree of deacetylation 75%–85%, Viscosity 5–20 mPa). PVA with an Mw ≈ 125,000 was purchased from Thomas Baker Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai and acetic acid from Merck Life Science Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai. EV and microbiological media were received from Loba Chemie, Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai. E. coli (ATCC8739) and S. aureus (ATCC 6538) were obtained from SDM College of Medical Science and Hospital, Dharwad. Ethyl alcohol (LR grade) was distilled and used. Double distilled water was used to prepare the polymer blend films."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Film preparation EV incorporated CS/PVA (CPEV) blend films were prepared by a solvent casting method. 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 % of CS and PVA solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2 g of CS and PVA separately in 100 ml of 1 % aqueous acetic acid solution (w/v) and 100 mL of distilled water, respectively. CS solutions were kept for stirring about 12 h and then filtered using cheesecloth. PVA solutions were kept for stirring for 10 h at 60 ℃ . 2 % of EV solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of EV in 10 mL ethyl alcohol. CS and PVA solutions were mixed at three different ratios (1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) and stirred for 4−5 h at 60 ℃ until the binary blend solution became clear and homogeneous. To the resulting CS/PVA blend solution 10 mL of 2 % EV solution was added and blended by continuous stirring until the solution becomes homogeneous (4−5 h) and degassed. The film forming solution was poured onto a petri dish placed on the uniform surface and allowed to dry at room temperature for about one week. After drying, the film was peeled off from the petri dish, sealed in a zip bag and stored in a desiccator for further use. Composition of different film forming solutions is shown in Table S1. 2.2.2 Film thickness measurement Film thickness was measured using a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo high accuracy micrometer-S700, Japan) with a 0.001 mm resolution. Measurements were taken at five different locations of each film sample and the average film thickness was calculated. 2.2.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at break) were measured by using Dak System INC, Universal Testing Machine (Series 7200-1 KN) according to ASTM-D882 standard test (ASTM, 1992). The films were cut into strips of 25 mm wide and 100 mm long. Initial grip separation and crosshead speed were set at 50 mm and 1 mm/min respectively. The entire tests were carried at room temperature in air. 2.2.4 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy The interaction among blend components was determined by attenuated total reflection (ATR) method using the IR spectrometer (FT-IR-ATR, Prestage 21, Shimadzu, Japan). Before the analysis, the prepared polymer samples were kept in a desiccator containing silica gel for 7 days at room temperature. The measurements were recorded in the wavenumber of 400 and 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 at room temperature. The spectra were recorded by mounting the film directly in the sample holder. 2.2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface morphology of film samples was studied using JEOL JSM-6360 scanning electron microscopy. The tests were carried out at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The specimens were sputter-coated with gold layer to avoid charging under a high electron beam and mounted on metal stub using double-sided sticky tape. 2.2.6 Water contact angle (WCA) measurement The static contact angle of water on the polymeric film surface was recorded at 25 ± 2 ℃ using contact angle analyzer (Model DMs-401, Kyowa Interface Science Co. Ltd., Tokyo). The size of the liquid drop with a volume of approximately 1 μ L was taken for all the measurements. Three samples with the same formulation and five measurements in each sample were recorded and averaged. Double distilled water was used for the study. 2.2.7 Light transparency and opacity measurements UV-Vis absorption spectra of film samples were recorded in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Model UV-1601). Each film sample was cut into a rectangular piece (1 × 4 cm) and placed directly in a test cell and measurements were performed using air as the reference. The results have been expressed as percentage transmittance. The measurements were done in triplicate and the average was calculated. The transparency at 600 nm ( T 600 ) was obtained using the following equation (Han & Floros, 1997). (1) T 600 = - l o g % T b where % T is percentage transmittance and b is the film thickness in mm. The opacity of the films was calculated by the following equation according to the method described by (Gontard & Guilbert, 1994). (2) O p a c i t y = A 500 b where A 500 absorbance at 500 nm and b is the film thickness in nm 2.2.8 Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (OTR) The water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) of the pure CS, PVA and CPEV blend films were calculated by using Mocon Permatran, according to the ASTM F1249-90 standard. Under the condition of 100 % RH, the tests were carried out at ambient conditions, and they were repeated three times, and the average values were calculated. Results were expressed in g/(m2⸳d) (Tock, 1983). The OTR of the pure CS, PVA and CPEV blend films was calculated by oxygen permeability tester (Noselab ATS, Italia) at 25 ℃ and 54 % RH in accordance with ASTM D-3985. All specimens were conditioned at ambient conditions. The OTRs of each film sample were averaged from three separate tests and results were expressed in cc/(m2⸳d) (Jagadish, Raj, & Asha, 2009; Kanatt, Rao, Chawla, & Sharma, 2012). 2.2.9 Food compatibility The ingredients in the plastic packaging materials may cause toxicity as a result of their migration to the foodstuff in which the food is packed (Bureau of Indian Standards (IS:, 1981). The overall migration of additives of blend films into different food stimulants is evaluated as per IS:9845-1998 specifications. Blend films were exposed to food simulants like distilled water, 3 % acetic acid and 50 % ethanol (representing aqueous foods, acidic foods and alcoholic beverages, respectively) at 40 ℃ for 10 d simulating filling and storing condition at room temperature. Overall migration of additives was determined by exposing the film sample to food stimulant under stipulated conditions of time and temperature. Extracted simulant was evaporated and migrated material was estimated gravimetrically. The results were expressed as microgram per square decimeter. 2.2.10 Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activities of CPEV blend films were performed against E. coli (Gram negative) and S. aureus (Gram positive) bacteria using agar-well diffusion method (Tepe, Daferera, Sokmen, Sokmen, & Polissiou, 2005). In this method, weighed films were dissolved in phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.0–7.2) 10 mg/mL, followed by sterilization using a 0.45 μm isopore membrane filter. Each microorganism was suspended in sterile saline and diluted at 106 colony forming units (CFU) per mL. They were ‘flood-inoculated’ onto the surface of nutrient agar media. The wells (8 mm in diameter) were cut from the agar and 0.5 mL of film solution was delivered into them. After incubation for 24 h at 37 ℃ , all plates were examined for any zones of growth inhibition. All tests were performed in duplicate. The antimicrobial activities of the prepared polymer films were also observed by the colony forming unit (CFU) method (Haque et al., 2017). The study was conducted against two bacterial strains E. coli and S. aureus. Bacterial samples and film samples were diluted to 1:10. 0.1 mL of diluted (1:10) solution was inoculated onto the sterile agar plates. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 h, after incubation the plates were observed for colonies and were counted under the colony counter chamber. The CFU values of all the samples were calculated by using the following equation: (3) C F U / m l = N u m b e r o f c o l o n i e s × D i l u t i o n f a c t o r V o l u m e p l a t e d ( m l ) The obtained CFU values were expressed in log (CFU/mL). 2.2.11 Statistical analysis All experiments were carried out in triplicate and data were presented as mean value with their standard error indicated (mean ± SE). Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 17.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, II, U. S. A.). A statistical difference at p < 0.05 was considered to be significant."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Appearance and film thickness,"3.1 Appearance and film thickness EV incorporated CS/PVA blend films (CPEV) that had golden yellow color. The blend films were visually homogeneous (Fig. S1) and miscible in all proportion indicated strong intermolecular interactions between blend components. The Mechanical properties of the blend films depend on the thickness of the film. The average film thickness of 0.06 – 0.09 mm was used for the analysis of mechanical properties. Only 2 % of EV was used in the present study, therefore EV had no major effect on film thickness."
6,Mechanical properties,"3.2 Mechanical properties It is necessary for packaging materials to have good mechanical strength to maintain packaging integrity during handling and storage (Wihodo & Moraru, 2013). The mechanical properties such as tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) of studied films are presented in Fig. 1 . TS of pure CS and PVA showed similar values as reported by Huei and Hwa (1996) and Bonilla, Fortunati, Atarés, Chiralt, and Kenny (2014); Costa-Júnior, Barbosa-Stancioli, Mansur, Vasconcelos, and Mansur (2009), respectively. CS/PVA film exhibited improved TS compared to pure CS and PVA. When EV was added into CS/PVA matrix with increasing CS content, TS of CPEV blend films increased by 39, 45 and 86 % for CPEV-1, CPEV-2 and CPEV-3, respectively. This improvement in TS of CPEV active films could be due to the addition of cross linking agent, EV that strengthen CS/PVA matrix by formation of Schiff base (CN) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The aldehyde group (−CHO) of EV react with the amino group (–NH2) of CS to generate Schiff base (CN), and the hydroxyl group (−OH) of EV and PVA react with the amino and hydroxyl groups of CS to form hydrogen bond (Li, Miao, Wu, Chen, & Zhang, 2014), as evident from FTIR spectra and as shown in Scheme 1 . The similar observation is reported by Tomadoni et al. (2019). It was observed from Fig. 1 that CS/PVA had %EB of 2.6 ± 0.1 . Incorporation of EV into 1:3 CS:PVA matrix showed increased %EB for CPEV-1. Further increasing CS content in CPEV-2 and CPEV-3 blend films showed decreased %EB as compared with CPEV-1 (Table S3). Increased stiffness of CPEV blend films could be due to cross linking of EV with CS/PVA in the polymer matrix. This clearly indicates that properties of blend films were influenced by the presence of EV. In the present study almost 2–3 fold increase in the TS and % EB was observed for EV incorporated CS/PVA blend films (CPEV) compared to the existing reported CS/PVA films incorporated with pomegranate peel/mint extract (Kanatt et al., 2012)."
7,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool used to investigate the interaction between components in the blend films. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of blend films could be explained by FTIR analysis. The FTIR spectra of neat CS, PVA, CS/PVA and CPEV blend films are shown in Fig. 2 . The observed bands of pure CS, PVA and EV are presented in Table S2. The FTIR spectrum of pure CS showed characteristic bands at 3395, 2932, 2880, 1634, 1545 cm−1 assigned to the −OH and –NH stretching, CH symmetric, CO stretching (amide I), asymmetric stretching –NH bending (amide II), respectively (Kaur, Jindal, Maiti, & Mahajan, 2019; Wu, Ying, Liu, Zhang, & Huang, 2018). The characteristic bands appeared at 899 and 1064 cm−1 mainly due to the saccharide group (Jin, Wang, & Bai, 2009), and band at 1150 cm−1 can be attributed to asymmetric stretching of COC of bridge (Fernandes Queiroz, Melo, Sabry, Sassaki, & Rocha, 2015). The bands occurred at 1064 and 1020 cm−1 correspond to CO stretching (Tomadoni et al., 2019). In the spectrum of pure PVA, the broad band observed at ca. 3340 cm−1 was ascribed to the OH stretching vibration from the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The asymmetric stretching vibration was found at 2935 cm−1, indicating the presence of methylene group (CH2). The band at 1718 cm−1 was assigned to stretching vibrations of CO groups of the remaining vinyl acetate units in the PVA backbone (Abdelghany, Menazea, & Ismail, 2019; Ghaderi, Hosseini, Keyvani, & Gómez-Guillén, 2019). The weak stretching vibration observed at 1326 cm−1 is due to the COH bending vibration. The strong bands at 1249 and 840 cm−1 are assigned to the CC stretching and CH rocking of PVA. The band at 1083 cm−1 corresponds to the CO stretching vibrations (Lević et al., 2014). FTIR spectrum of EV exhibited the absorption band at 3366 cm−1 which corresponds to the phenolic OH stretching vibration. The bands ca. 2900–2800 cm−1 were attributed to aromatic CH stretching and aliphatic CH stretching (Pavia, Lampman, Kriz, & Vyvyan, 2008). The strong band at 1678 cm−1 was characteristic for the benzaldehyde CO stretching vibration (González-Baró, Parajón-Costa, Franca, & Pis-Diez, 2008). An intense peak at 1579 cm−1 corresponds to aromatic CC stretching vibration superimposed on the CH in-plane deformation (Vieira, Cestari, de Santos, & Rezende, 2006). An intense peak at 1513 cm−1 corresponds to the CH stretching vibration in the −CHO group coupled with the in-plane deformations of the aromatic ring (Levic et al., 2013). The bands at 1439 cm−1 and 1398 cm−1 assigned to the CH deformation in the CH3 of a methoxyl group (Ibrahim, Sipaut, & Yusof, 2009). The band at 1380 cm−1 attributed to an in-plane deformation of phenolic −OH (González-Baró et al., 2008). The stretching vibration at 1277 cm−1 assigned to COC stretching vibration. An intense peak at 1169 cm−1 corresponds to the CO group. The band at 1096 cm − 1 is attributed to the aromatic CH in plane deformation. The absorption related to the ether CO symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations (=C–O–C = ring) appears at 970 cm−1. The stretching bands observed in the range of 784–835 cm−1 were responsible for CH out-of-plane deformations in all positions of H units (Levic et al., 2013). The spectrum of CS/PVA blend film shows that the peaks related CC stretching and carbonyl group of PVA shifted to higher wavenumber from 1249 to 1257 cm−1 and 1718 to 1728 cm−1, respectively and intensity of peaks observed at 1718, 1543 and 1425 cm−1 decreased suggested intermolecular interactions between CS and PVA molecules. According to Wu et al. (2018), the lack of new peaks in the CS/PVA blend film compared with that of the pure films, indicated that CS was compatible with PVA. Similar results were reported by Ghaderi et al. (2019) and Tomadoni et al. (2019). When EV was incorporated to the CS/PVA matrix, the absorption peak of OH shifted to a lower wavenumber (Fig. 2) in CPEV films, indicating an increase in hydrogen bonds which enhanced the tensile properties of CPEV films with increasing CS content (Wu et al., 2018). Meanwhile, the band at ca. 1718 cm−1 shifted to a higher wavenumber (1738 cm−1) and/or disappeared in the spectrum of CPEV blend films (Fig. 2); this was attributed to the formation of inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between NH and OH groups (Ghaderi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) of CS, PVA and EV. Furthermore, intensity of strong band observed at 1579 cm−1 in pure EV decreased and shifted to lower wavenumber in CPEV blend films confirmed the interaction between EV and CS/PVA. A band in the range 1641−1653 cm−1 was observed in CPEV blend films due to the formation of (CN) Schiff base (aldehyde group of EV with amine group of CS) which enhanced the tensile properties of CPEV blend films (Costa-Júnior et al., 2009). It was also observed that peak (1641−1653 cm−1) intensity increased with increasing CS content indicated tensile properties of blend films also increased with increasing CS from CPEV-1 to CPEV-3. These results were in accordance with results presented by Zhang et al. (2015)."
8,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The SEM micrographs of pure CS, pure PVA, CS/PVA, CPEV-1, CPEV-2, CPEV-3 blend films are shown in Fig. 3 (a–f), respectively. The surface morphology of CS film was smooth, homogeneous with some straps, while no straps were observed in PVA film. However, some pores were observed on the top surface of CS/PVA blend films (Fig. 3c), although these holes seem to be closed pores. This indicated low compatibility between CS and PVA. These observations were similar to those reported by Abdelghany et al. (2019). Addition of cross linking agent EV, into CS/PVA matrix (CPEV) results in a more dense and compact homogeneous surface. This indicated complete miscibility of the blend components due to formation of Schiff base and hydrogen bond between the functional groups of the blended components (−OH and –NH2 groups of CS and −OH groups of PVA and EV) (Merlusca et al., 2018), as evident from the FTIR spectra. These results were in good agreement with previous finding of Zhang et al. (2015), who reported smooth and a compact structure of CS films with lower concentration (0.5–10 %) of vanilline."
9,Water contact angle (WCA) measurement,"3.5 Water contact angle (WCA) measurement Water contact angle measurement is another important structural analysis for the characterization of packaging material (Calderón-Aguirre et al., 2015). Fig. 4 shows a photo image of water drops on the surface of pure CS, PVA, CS/PVA and CPEV blend films, respectively. It is a general concept that the material having contact angle with lower value ( θ < 90 ° ) indicates the hydrophilic nature and higher value ( θ > 90 ° ) indicates hydrophobic nature (Kasai et al., 2019). As it is observed in Fig. 4, pure CS film showed a contact angle of θ = 111 ° , exhibiting the hydrophobic nature. The high contact angle value of CS film showed hydrophobic surface (Almeida, Frollini, Castellan, & Coma, 2010; Kasai et al., 2019; Peesan, Rujiravanit, & Supaphol, 2003) whereas PVA, CS/PVA, CPEV blend films exhibited hydrophilic surface. CPEV-3 film showed significant increase in the surface hydrophobicity compared to CPEV-1 and CPEV-2 films, which was mainly associated with increased hydrophobic CS content and addition of EV in the blend films. Incorporation of cross linking agent EV, into CS/PVA matrix leads to the formation of Schiff base and hydrogen bonds between the reactive groups of CS, PVA and EV (as shown in Scheme 1). This interaction results in more dense and compact homogeneous top surface as confirmed by the SEM analysis; also contributed to increased hydrophobicity of CPEV-3. Similar observations were reported in the literature by Chuang, Young, Yao, and Chiu (1999) and Faibish, Yoshida, and Cohen (2002)."
10,Light transparency and opacity measurements,"3.6 Light transparency and opacity measurements One of the desired characteristics of packaging material is that it should protect food from the effects of light, especially UV radiation (Kanatt et al., 2012). Oxidation alter the flavor and decrease the nutritional quality of food (Khoirunnisa, Joni, Panatarani, Rochima, & Praseptiangga, 2018). The transmission of UV and visible light at a selected wavelength (200−800 nm) of CS, PVA, CS/PVA and CPEV films are shown in Fig. 5 a. It can be depicted from Fig. 6 a that negligible UV light transmission (200−400 nm) was observed for CPEV blend films, compared to CS, PVA and CS/PVA films indicating higher UV screening ability. These observations were in line with researcher Bonilla et al. (2014). Negligible UV light transmission of CPEV blend films may be attributed to the presence of aromatic −OH group in EV, which enhanced the n - π * absorbance in the range 200−400 nm (Li et al., 2014; Piñeros-Hernandez, Medina-Jaramillo, López-Córdoba, & Goyanes, 2017). These observations suggest that CPEV blend films act as an excellent UV barrier. It was observed from Fig. 5c that incorporation of EV resulted in higher opacity, i.e. less transparency (Fig. 5b), in the resultant CPEV blend films compared to pure CS, PVA and CS/PVA films. The increase in opacity may have been the result of contraction of the film matrix in which the polymer inter-chain spacing was decreased, permitting less light to pass through the film (Ghaderi et al., 2019)."
11,Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (OTR),"3.7 Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (OTR) The investigation of the barrier properties of a polymer is an important parameter to predict the shelf life and applicability of the packaged product. A proper barrier to moisture and oxygen in food systems can increase the quality of the product and extend the product shelf life. The presence of water in foods may facilitate various chemical and enzymatic reactions during storage, impairing food functional characteristics (e.g. crunchiness). For this reason, water vapor permeability is an important parameter, controlling water transport between the food and its external environment (Yang & Paulson, 2000). The results of WVTR analyses of films are presented in Fig. 6a. Results showed that addition of cross linking agent EV, had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the WVTR of CPEV blend films. The WVTR of CPEV blend films decreased with increasing the CS content in the film. This may be attributed to the formation of Schiff base (CN) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, as previously discussed in FTIR section. The availability of the free hydrophilic groups decreased with increasing intermolecular interactions within the CPEV active films which results in lower WVTR of active films. The similar results have been reported by Kanatt et al. (2012), Pelissari, Grossmann, Yamashita, and Pineda (2009), Tomadoni et al. (2019) and Li, Peng, Yie, and Xie (2006). The oxygen permeability is one of the most important parameter in a packaging material. Barrier to oxygen in a packaging system can increase food product shelf life and also improve the food quality (Brody, Bugusu, Han, Sand, & Mchugh, 2008). The OTR values presented in Fig. 6b indicated that the OTR of CPEV blend films decreased significantly (p < 0.05) when compared to pure CS. This may due to the fact that CS could form Schiff base (CN) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds with PVA and EV, which limit the inter-molecular chain mobility, contributing to the decrease of OTR (Kanatt et al., 2012). The decreased permeability to water vapor and oxygen was also due to the presence of more dense and compact homogeneous surface of CPEV blend films, as confirmed by the SEM analysis."
12,Food compatibility,"3.8 Food compatibility Packaging material in contact with food should be as inert as possible, having least possible interaction with food. Packaging material shall not transfer any additives into the food in unacceptable quantities (Jagadish et al., 2009). Hence to assess the suitability of blend films for food packaging application, its migration characteristics into food simulants was determined. The results showed that migration values of each film in all the three simulants (such as distilled water, 3% acetic acid and 50 % ethyl alcohol), were well below the legal overall migration limits of 10 mg/dm2 (Table 1 ). Incorporation of EV into CS/PVA matrix significantly lowered (p < 0.05) the migration values of CPEV blend films. CPEV-1 showed the lowest migration values in all three simulants compared to CPEV-2 and CPEV-3. This phenomenon may occur due to cross linking reaction of EV with CS/PVA matrix to form a more compact structure through formation of Schiff base (CN) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between functional groups of CS, PVA and EV (Scheme 1). It can be seen from Table 1 that overall migration values of CPEV blend films in all three simulants were 103 times lower than acceptable limits of 10 mg/dm2 (IS:, 1981), indicating its compatibility for food packaging applications."
13,Antibacterial activity,"3.9 Antibacterial activity The incorporation of antimicrobial agent into packaging materials prolongs food shelf life by inhibiting the microorganisms. The images of antibacterial activity of CPEV blend films against the selected microorganisms such as E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive) bacteria were presented in Table 2 and Fig. 7 . CS exhibits inherent antimicrobial properties but the exact mechanism for the antimicrobial activity of CS is not known. Moreira, Pereda, Marcovich, and Roura (2011) reported that the antibacterial activity of CS could be due to the polycationic nature of the molecule, which permits interaction and forms polyelectrolyte complexes with polymers that produce at the bacteria cell surface. Pure PVA did not show inhibition zone, indicating that PVA had no antibacterial activity (Hu & Wang, 2016). Similarly, Jay and Rivers (1984) and Morris et al. (1979) have reported the antimicrobial activity of food flavoring compounds. Obtained values of inhibition zone for EV (18 & 12 for E. coli and S. aureu, respectively) were in good agreement with earlier reported by Morris et al. (1979). Incorporation of EV had significant effect on the antibacterial activity of CS/PVA films. As seen in the Fig. 7 CPEV blend films inhibited the growth of E. coli more efficiently compared to S. aureus bacteria. Furthermore, the increased inhibitory zone and reduction in CFU counts of CPEV blend films was observed by increasing the CS content (Fig. 6c). The reasons may be attributed to the different structure of the cell membrane. (Ahmed, Hiremath, & Jacob, 2017; Valodkar, Modi, Pal, & Thakore, 2011) reported that the microbial inactivation was attributed to the differences in cell wall structures of the microorganisms. This enhanced antibacterial activity of CPEV blend films could be explained on the basis of inherent antibacterial activity of CS and EV. These observations were in good agreement with those reported by Kanatt et al. (2012), they reported enhanced antibacterial activity of CS/PVA films by the addition of pomegranate peel extract and mint extract. In accordance with our findings Bonilla et al. (2014) reported that in CS/PVA blend films reduction of CFU count was observed with increasing CS content. (Liu, Wang, & Lan, 2018) observed increased antimicrobial activity with increasing CS content in CS/PVA films prepared via electrospray technique."
14,Conclusions,"EV incorporated CS/PVA blend films (CPEV) with different ratios (1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) of CS and PVA were prepared by a solvent casting method. The effect of cross linking agent EV, on mechanical, structural, barrier, optical, food compatibility and antibacterial properties of CPEV blend films were investigated. The addition of EV showed a significant increase in the tensile strength, surface hydrophobicity, miscibility and significant reduction in WVTRs and OTRs of CPEV blend films. This could be due to the formation of Schiff base (CN) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between functional groups of CS, PVA and EV, as evident from FTIR spectral analysis. Results of UV studies and antibacterial activity showed that CPEV blend films act as an excellent barrier to UV light and efficiently inhibit E.coli bacteria compared to S.aureus bacteria. The overall migration values of CPEV blend films were 103 times lower than acceptable limits of 10 mg/dm2. CPEV blend films satisfy the desirable requirements of food packaging material. Hence, CPEV blend films could be used as UV defensive active packaging material in the food industry."
