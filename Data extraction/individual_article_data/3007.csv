0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation has been accepted as an important pathway to extensively produce valuable chemicals in the field of petrochemical, coal chemical, and fine chemical industries [1]. About 25% of chemical transformations comprise in least one hydrogenation step. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenation is one of the most in-depth research topics in catalysis [2]. However, it remains a known challenge to selectively hydrogenate a single group for a compound with multiple unsaturated groups like CC, CO, NO2, CC, CN, and COOH(R) [3–6]. Hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), as an essential chemical, has been widely applied in drug synthesis, cosmetics, and food additives [7,8]. Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CAL) using molecular hydrogen (H2) is a clean and efficient process with atom economy for HCAL production among various methods [9]. From the thermodynamics point of view, the carbon–carbon double bond (CC) is more prone to be hydrogenated than the carbonyl group (CO) in a CAL molecule [10]. However, the conjunction effect of the benzene ring, CC, and CO, inevitably leads to a reduction in selectivity, which would produce a mixture of HCAL, cinnamyl alcohol (COH), and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOH) [11]. Thus, to individually and effectively generate HCAL remains a challenge. Over the past few decades, although a variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for promoting selective hydrogenation of CAL to HCAL, such as Pd/Al2O3 [12], CoPt/Fe3O4 [13], Pd@C [14], Ni/AC [15], Pd/NRGO [16], Pt/ZnFe-LDH [17,18], Pd⊂MIL-101(Fe) [19], Pd/LaMO3 [20], Pd/La2O2CO3 [21], Pd/NiCo2O4-x [22], and Pt/NixFe1-xAl2O4+δ [23], most of them run under an elevated temperature and high pressure. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop a selective hydrogenation process under a mild condition. Semiconductor photocatalysis provides an ideal approach for synthesizing high value-added and metastable chemicals under mild conditions [24–33]. Among of the reported catalysts, ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanosheets, including BiOCl [34,35], Bi2MoO6 [36,37], HxTiyO4 [38–40], ZnTi-LDH [41], Co(OH)2 [42], and TiO2 [43], show better performance for organic synthesis because of their large specific surface areas, exposed specific crystal facet, abundant active sites, and superior separation ability of photogenerated carrier [44–46]. In particular, 2D nanosheets with several atoms thickness may afford suitable active sites for selective chemical adsorption of the reactants/intermediates on the catalyst surface via coordination with the specific functional groups, and further minimize the travel distance for transferring the photogenerated electrons and holes to reactants [47–50]. Moreover, the surface characters on the nanosheets can also act as excellent supports for the loading of a cocatalyst with high dispersion via strong interfacial interaction [51,52]. Niobate nanosheets have been extensively studied for photocatalysis applications [53,54]. SnNb2O6 is a promising niobium-based photocatalyst with a visible light response, consisting of a corner-sharing octahedral NbO6 sheet and an edge-sharing SnⅡO8 square antiprism flat [55]. Meanwhile, SnNb2O6 ultrathin nanosheets (SN) would be acquired by a simple hydrothermal method [56]. Moreover, SN has been applied to photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, degradation of pollutants, and selective reduction of CO2 [57–59]. SN could offer abundant exposed Nb5+ on the surface, which may serve as Lewis acid sites that may efficiently chemisorb and activate the specific functional group such as CC. More importantly, such nanosheets may have potential advantages for constructing efficient composite photocatalysts for the selective synthesis of HCAL. Another critical issue for high efficiently producing HCAL is to achieve hydrogen dissociation and activation. Pd as a star catalyst has attracted wide attention benefiting from the outstanding dissociation and activation ability for hydrogen [60]. Supporting Pd on a catalyst surface is an effective and common strategy for hydrogenating unsaturated compounds [61]. When H2 is dissociated on Pd, activated H atoms (H·) and hydrides (Pd-H) would be concurrently generated [62–64]. The formation of hydrides (Pd-H) results in over hydrogenation of the target product into byproducts [65–68]. Therefore, inhibiting the generation of Pd-H while enhancing the H· may improve the target product yield. An effective strategy is adopted to solve the issue by introducing a second metal (Au, Ag, Cu) in Pd, including alloys, core-shell, and segregated phases [69–72], which is beneficial to a synergism that the electronic and geometric effects [73–75]. However, the alloys and core-shell would promote the desired product selectivity, while the activity is inhibited due to the diminution of Pd utilization efficiency [76,77]. It was reported that segregated Pd and Au NPs supported on a catalyst might simultaneously enhance photocatalytic activity and selectivity by suppressing the generation of Pd-H species and maximizing the efficiency for metal utilization. In addition, Au-Pd NPs would act as an electron acceptor to gather the photogenerated electron, which facilitates generating the H· [78]. Therefore, it is feasible to design an ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet with segregated Pd and Au NPs as a photocatalyst for the selective hydrogenation of CAL to HCAL. Herein, SnNb2O6 ultrathin nanosheets (SN) with different Au-Pd ratios are developed as composite photocatalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CAL at room temperature. Particularly, Au6-Pd1/SN exhibits high CAL conversion (99.8%) and high HCAL selectivity (91.0%). The structure and surface properties of the prepared samples are revealed by SEM, TEM, BET, TPD, XPS, and EPR. The adsorption behaviors of relevant molecules on the catalysts are investigated via in situ FTIR spectra. Controlled experiments are conducted to elucidate the roles of Au, Pd NPs and SN in activity and selectivity. The results indicate that the selective hydrogenation process is cooperatively achieved by SN, Au, and Pd NPs in composite photocatalysts under visible light irradiation. Finally, a possible synergistic catalytic mechanism is proposed for the highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogenation of CAL to HCAL."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagent and chemicals,"2.1 Reagent and chemicals Nb2O5, SnO, SnCl2, HAuCl4·4H2O, and PdCl2 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Cinnamaldehyde (99%) and cinnamyl alcohol (98%) were supplied from J&K Scientific. Hydrocinnamaldehyde (95%), hydrocinnamyl alcohol (99%), and cyclohexane (99.5%) were obtained from Macklin. All chemicals were used without any further purification. Deionized and ultrapure water used in the synthesis were from local sources."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheets (SN) were prepared according to the previously reported method [58]. Under the protection of nitrogen, 0.63 g of Nb2O5·nH2O and 0.37 g of SnCl2 were added in 70 mL of ultrapure water. The suspension solution was vigorously stirred for 30 min and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-line stainless steel autoclave. Subsequently, the sealed autoclave was heated in an oven at 200 °C for 48 h. Finally, the solid product was centrifuged, washed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum oven. For comparison, layered SnNb2O6 (LSN) was prepared by a traditional solid-state reaction [60]. 1.35 g of SnO and 2.66 g of Nb2O5 were evenly mixed by grinding under an inert atmosphere. The prepared mixture was transferred into a porcelain boat and heated inside a tube furnace under argon flow at 600 °C for 10 h. A series of Au-Pd/SN nanocomposite catalysts were prepared via a photodeposition method. The weight percentage of the supported metal is 1% in all catalysts. The representative sample Au6-Pd1/SN, with a molar ratio of Au/Pd of 6:1, was synthesized as follows: Firstly, 100 mg of SnNb2O6 nanosheets was dispersed into 60 mL of 25 vol% methanol aqueous solution under vigorous stirring. 194 μL of HAuCl4·4H2O solution (10 mg/mL) was dripped into the suspension of SnNb2O6. The mixture was illuminated with a xenon lamp for 3 h under N2 atmosphere. After stirring for 30 min, 14 μL of H2PdCl4 solution (10 mg/mL) was added to the above suspension. The mixture was irradiated for another 3 h. In the end, the product was washed by deionized and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The final sample was denoted as Au6-Pd1/SN. Similarly, the Aux-Pdy/SnNb2O6 (molar ratio x:y = 0:1, 1:8, 1:6, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 and 1:0, respectively) were prepared by the same procedure, which were labeled as Pd/SN, Au1-Pd8/SN, Au1-Pd6/SN, Au1-Pd4/SN, Au1-Pd2/SN, Au1-Pd1/SN, Au2-Pd1/SN, Au4-Pd1/SN, Au8-Pd1/SN, and Au/SN, respectively. For comparison, Au6-Pd1/LSN was prepared with the same metal loading following the same procedures as those for Au6-Pd1/SN. The actual contents of Au, Pd in the Au-Pd/SN were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Table S1), which are quantitatively consistent with the calculated value."
4,Sample characterization,"2.3 Sample characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of these prepared samples were collected by using an X-Pert-MPD diffractometer with a Cu Kα line (λ = 1.54051 Å). Field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi New Generation SU8010 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and higher-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL model JEM2010 EX microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope Multimode IIIa, Veeco Instruments) with Si-tip cantilever was used to evaluate the morphology of the obtained nanosheets on the silicon substrate. The quantitative analysis of the amount of metal on the samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using PerkinElmer (Avio 200). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system using Al as the excitation source. The binding energies were corrected using the position of the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. UV–Vis diffuse reflect spectra (UV–vis DRS) of samples were obtained on Varian Cary500 with barium sulfate as reflectance standard. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was measured on an Autosorb-1C-TCD physical adsorption instrument (American Quantech-Rome) using a Micrometric ASAP 2020 system. Electrochemical measurement was determined on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) with a standard three-electrode quartz cell·NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3–TPD) was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Electron spin resonance (EPR) spectra was recorded by a Bruker A300 spectrometer."
5,In situ FTIR measurement,"2.4 In situ FTIR measurement In situ FTIR spectra of hydrocinnamaldehyde, hydrocinnamyl alcohol, and pyridine absorbed on prepared samples were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (NICOLET IS50) at 4 cm−1 resolution using 64 scans per spectrum. Every sample was pressed into transparent sheets and then put into the sample holder, which could be moved vertically along the cell tube. Before measurements, sheets were treated to dynamic vacuum (6 × 10-2 hPa) at 180 °C for 3 h to remove surface residues and cool to room temperature. FTIR spectrum of a sample was collected. Subsequently, 15 μL of an organic compound was injected into the sample sheet by a syringe. After adsorption saturation for 30 min, a FTIR spectrum was collected to characterize the physical and chemical adsorption of the organic compound in a sample. The physisorbed organic compound was extracted via a further evacuation at 150 °C for 15 min at 6 × 10-2 hPa. Finally, a FTIR spectrum was recorded for showing chemical adsorption information of organic compounds on the sample."
6,EPR measurements,"2.5 EPR measurements 15 mg of the sample, 0.3 mmol of N-benzylidene-tert-butylamine N-oxide (PBN), and 4 mL of ethanol were mixed well in a quartz reactor. A stream of H2 (99.99%, 20 mL/min) was passed through the solution for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the filtrate was collected and transferred to an EPR tube. The EPR spectra of the samples were recorded."
7,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"2.6 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The liquid phase hydrogenations of cinnamaldehyde were carried out as follows. 16 mg of catalyst was suspended in a 20 mL of Schlenk tube, which contained a mixture of cinnamaldehyde (0.1 mmol, 12.7 μL) and cyclohexane (2.0 mL) saturated with H2. The reaction system was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLX-SXE300 D, Perfect Light) equipped with a 400 nm cut-off filter. Reaction temperatures were controlled by circulating condensate water. After the reaction, 2 mL of aliquots were collected, centrifuged, and further filtered through a Millipore filter (0.22 µm) to remove the catalyst particles. The final products were determined by a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (GC-2014C equipped with a SH-RTX-5, 30 m × 0.25 μm × 0.32 mm column). The carrier gas is Helium with a purity of 99.999% at the rate of 20 mL min−1. The temperatures of the injector and detector were maintained at 220 and 280 °C, respectively. The pressure of the injection was set at 57.8 kPa. The column temperature program was programmed from 120 to 220 °C at 10 °C/min. The conversion of cinnamaldehyde and the selectivity of hydrocinnamaldehyde were defined as follows: Conversion (%) = [(C0 − Ccinnamaldehyde)/C0] × 100, Selectivity (%) = [Chydrocinnamaldehyde/(C0 − Ccinnamaldehyde)] × 100. C0 represents the initial concentration of cinnamaldehyde before illumination. Ccinnamaldehyde, and Chydrocinnamaldehyde are the concentrations of the substrate cinnamaldehyde and the corresponding hydrocinnamaldehyde in solution during the photocatalytic reaction, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of structures and morphologies,"3.1 Characterization of structures and morphologies As shown in Fig. 1 a, the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples are well indexed to the standard monoclinic phase of SnNb2O6 (JCPDS#84–1810; Monoclinic phase; Space group: C2/c; a = 17.093 Å, b = 4.877 Å, c = 5.558 Å), suggesting that the SnNb2O6 materials were successfully synthesized. Compared with LSN, the peak intensity and half peak width of SN are weakened and extended, respectively, showing the characteristics of nanostructure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are performed to investigate the morphology and surface microstructure of SN. The SEM image (Fig. 1 b) clearly shows that the product consists of a sheet-like structure with a transverse size up to 500 nm. A typical TEM image, shown in Fig. 1c, exhibits that SN is nearly transparent nanosheets. As can be seen from the HRTEM image in Fig. 1d, the interplanar spacing of d = 0.24 nm and d = 0.37 nm match well with that of the (020) and (310) crystallographic plane of the monoclinic SnNb2O6, respectively. Phase images (Fig. S1) and AFM images (Fig. 1e and f) show that SN possesses a wrinkled surface with an average thickness of 4 nm, which corresponds to 5-unit cells of the SnNb2O6. All the results suggest the successful synthesis of ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheets. The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts with different Au/Pd molar ratios are shown in Fig. S2. No significant change is observed in the diffraction pattern for the Au-Pd/SN compared to SN, presenting that the Au-Pd loading does not lead towards a noticeable change in the crystal structure of the composites. Notably, no significant Au, Pd signal is observed in all composites, which may be attributed to the particle size lower than the detection limit of XRD or its evenly distribution. The existence of AuPd bimetals in the composites can be easily verified by TEM and XPS, which are discussed later. TEM was conducted to verify the existence of AuPd bimetals in the composites. As shown in Fig. 2 a, black particles represent the metal NPs. The regular planar spacing of 0.234, 0.204, and 0.224 nm in Fig. 2b,c is consistent with the (111), (200) crystalline plane of Au, and (111) crystalline plane of Pd, respectively. It gives us information that Au and Pd NPs are separated rather than alloyed. The average size of the Au-Pd bimetallic NPs is calculated to be 6.8 ± 0.2 nm. The elemental mappings are performed on a sample (Fig. 2d) to reveal the spatial distribution of several elements in the nanostructure. As displayed in Fig. 2e-f, the mapping results show a homogeneous distribution of Sn, Nb, O, Au, and Pd elements throughout the whole Au-Pd/SN. In addition, Au and Pd signals are in different positions, revealing that the segregated bimetallic NPs are well distributed over the nanosheets, and the size of Au NPs is significantly larger than that of Pd NPs. The visual representation of EDS is illustrated in Fig. S3, which further confirms the loading of Au and Pd on SN. Fig. S4A shows the XPS spectra of SN, Au/SN, Pd/SN, and Au6-Pd1/SN. As displayed in Fig. S4A (d), the survey spectrum of Au-Pd/SN indicates that the element signals of Sn, O, and Nb are prominent, while Au or Pd signals are extremely weak due to low loading. The spin–orbit splitting value of Nb 3d is 2.8 eV, and two prominent peaks of Nb 3d at around 209.3 and 206.5 eV are characteristic of Nb5+ species (Fig. S4B). The O 1 s spectra of all samples can be split into three peaks, namely lattice oxygen (Olattice), coordination of O in hydroxy (OOH), and adsorbed oxygen species (Oabsor) (Fig. S4C). As shown in Fig S4D (a), the two Sn 3d binding energy (BE) of 3d3/2 (494.6 eV) and 3d5/2 (486.1 eV) indicate that Sn is in the Sn2+ chemical state [79,80]. A smaller portion of Sn4+ is detected in metal-SN (Fig. S4B), illustrating that bits of Sn2+ in metal-SnNb2O6 are oxidized, which might be ascribed to two reasons. First, the surface of the nanosheets is highly reactive. When a noble metal acid salt solution is added into the suspension of SN, part of Sn2+ on the surface of the nanosheets is dissolved. Since different redox potential between Sn2+ and noble metal ions (Fig. S5), Au3+ and Pd2+ are reduced to zero valence, while the Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+. Second, photogenerated holes can directly oxidize surface-Sn2+ into Sn4+ during the photodeposition. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks in Au6-Pd1/SN are located at 87.6 and 84.0 eV, respectively, which exhibits slight upshift as compared to that of Au/SN (87.2 and 83.6 eV for Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2, respectively), indicating a decrease in the electron cloud density of Au species in Au6-Pd1/SN. In the meantime, the Pd 3d3/2 peak at 340.7 eV and Pd 3d5/2 peak at 335.4 eV in Au6-Pd1/SN shift to lower binding energy as compared with those observed in Pd/SN (341.4 and 336.1 eV for Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2, respectively), suggesting the increase of electron density of Pd species in Au6-Pd1/SN. These results reveal that electron transfer at the Pd/SN and Au/SN interfaces may result from the Mott-Schottky contact [81,82]. The photoabsorption property and specific surface area of the semiconductor catalysts can affect the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. S6a, LSN and SN display absorption bands lower than 550 nm, leading to low visible light utilization efficiency. After the deposition of the metal NPs, the absorption intensity of the samples is increased in the range of 500–800 nm, in comparison to pure SN, indicating that metal/SN adsorb more visible light based on the surface plasma resonance from Au NPs and interband electron transition of Pd NPs. The prepared samples strongly absorb light with spectra from 400 to 780 nm, ensuring the high efficiency of light utilization in the visible light range. The specific surface areas of the LSN, SN, Au/SN, Pd/SN, and Au6-Pd1/SN are 2.2, 42.3, 53.9, 54.9, and 65.7 m2/g, respectively (Fig. S6b). The specific surface area of SN is 19 times higher than that of LSN because SN has overcome the steric inhibition of the adjacent layers. Moreover, the SBET of the samples with the introduction of Au or Pd NPs progressively increased. The higher specific surface area provides more active sites for easier transport of the reactants and promotes the photocatalytic activity. The acid sites on the SnNb2O6 samples are characterized by the in-situ FTIR spectra of pyridine (Py) adsorption, as deduced from the crystal structure of SnNb2O6. Fig. 4 represents the adsorption profiles of SN and LSN. These bands at 1640 and 1540 cm−1 are assigned to the in-plane ring-breathing vibration ν(CCN) of pyridine adsorbed on the Brønsted acid (B) sites (PyH+), and bands at 1450 and 1610 cm−1 are attributed to the ν(C-H) deformation vibration and ν(C-C) vibration as pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid (L) sites, respectively. The band at 1490 cm−1 is attributed to pyridine jointly adsorbed on the Brønsted and Lewis acid (B + L) sites [83]. After heating under vacuum conditions, the preservation of these bands indicates the chemisorption of pyridine and strong acidity on the surface of SN. In contrast, reduced and much weaker bands reflect the lower Lewis and Brønsted acid sites exposed on the surface of LSN than SN. These results validate the existence of acid sites in the SnNb2O6 sample, which is remarkably strengthened when the SnNb2O6 sample is made into an ultrathin structure. The acidity of SN and LSN is further investigated with the NH3-TPD (Fig. S7). The thermostability of NH4 + in the Brønsted acid sites is lower than that of NH3 assigned to the Lewis acid sites. It can be deduced that desorption peaks below 200 °C belong to Brønsted acid sites, and these desorption peaks at higher temperatures (above 200 °C) belong to Lewis acid sites [84]. Besides, the peak of Lewis acid sites is broader than that of Brønsted acid sites. The TCD signal peak of NH3 at about 146 and 162 °C may be attributed to NH4 + ions from Brønsted acid sites on SN and LSN, respectively. The prominent peaks from the coordinated NH3 appear at 328 and 341 °C on SN and LSN, which belong to the Lewis acid site. The NH3 adsorption amounts on the SN and LSN are 0.601 and 0.093 mmol/g, respectively. Furthermore, the larger area illustrated in the NH3-TPD curve of SN than that of LSN at a high temperature suggests that there are abundant acid sites on the surface of SN. The higher temperature peaks correspond to the Lewis acid sites account for ~ 90% of the total acid sites, indicating that SN possesses abundant Lewis acid sites. Photocatalytic performance is largely determined upon the behavior of the charge carriers, i.e., charge separation and migration. The effectiveness of these physical phenomena of a photocatalyst are well characterized via photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis [85,86]. As illustrated in Fig. 5 a, the photocurrent of nanosheets is higher than that of layered counterparts because the nanosheets could facilitate the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The photocurrent is further enhanced upon Au-Pd loading on the SN, suggesting that the interfacial contact between Au-Pd NPs and nanosheets can abate the photogenerated carrier recombination in Au6-Pd1/SN. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the catalysts was also carried out to explore the interfacial charge transfer process under darkness and light irradiation (Fig. 5b). A smaller arc radius implies low electron-hole recombination and faster charge transfer. The resistances of the samples follow the order of LSN < SN < Au6-Pd1/SN for both darkness and light irradiation. In addition, for all samples, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) under illumination is smaller than that in the darkness, suggesting that photogenerated electrons are engaged in the electron transfer over photoelectrode/ solution interface due to internal charge transfer at the interface between SN and Au-Pd under the illumination of visible light. Au-Pd in the nanocomposites can serve as a good electron acceptor, and therefore Au-Pd/SN composites show enhanced catalytic performance for selective hydrogenation under visible light. The synergistic effect of bimetallic Au-Pd NPs as intimate interfacial interaction between Au-Pd NPs and SN contributes to better photoelectrochemical performance and photocatalytic property."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogenation,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogenation The CAL hydrogenation is carried out to evaluate the photocatalytic performances of the prepared catalysts at ambient temperature. No product is detected in the absence of a catalyst or SN alone under light irradiation (Table 1 , entries 1–2). Pd/SN catalyst gives a CAL conversion of 99.8% with poor selectivity. The products include 34.8% of HCAL, 53.6% of HCOH, and 11.6% of styrene (ST), respectively (Table 1, entry 3). Au/SN catalyst shows inferior photocatalytic activity under the same conditions with a conversion of 1.5%, and ST is the only product via CAL hydrodeformylation (Table 1, entry 13). The selectivity of HCAL increases gradually with the increasing Au content in the Pd/SN catalyst, while conversions keep almost unchanged. The Au-Pd catalyst with optimum Au/Pd molar ratio of 6:1 exhibits both the excellent conversion of CAL (99.8%) and selectivity of HCAL (91.0%) (Table 1, entries 4–11). For further increase of Au amount, both conversion and selectivity are reduced (Table 1, entry 12). These results suggest that Au is responsible for regulating the selectivity of the desired product. Moreover, compared with Au6-Pd1/SN, Au6-Pd1/LSN shows disappointing catalytic performance (Table 1, entry 14). The difference in activities between Au6-Pd1/SN and Au6-Pd1/LSN may be ascribed to the weak coordination of CAL and low metal dispersion on the layered SnNb2O6. This result presents that the SnNb2O6 nanosheets with unique surface structure and electronic properties play a key role in improving photocatalytic performances. Furthermore, Au6-Pd1/SN shows only 23.4% of CAL conversion and 52.5% of HCAL selectivity in the dark (Table 1, entry 15). The above results confirm that Pd can dissociate H2 at room temperature, but the selective hydrogenation performance is greatly enhanced with the aid of light. From UV-DRS spectra, it is clear that the SN are excited by a wavelength of less than 489 nm. Au generally can be excited only by a wavelength of 520–540 nm [87]. Two type of band pass filters are used to clarify the contribution in wavelength dependence of photocatalytic activity. In Fig. S8a, the irradiance spectra are given for 300 W xenon lamp with different filters. The irradiance spectra of illuminated light and corresponding activity are presented in Fig. S8b. The optimum conversion of CAL (99.8%) and selectivity of HCAL (91.0%) are achieved over Au6-Pd1/SN under light illumination (λ ≥ 400 nm). We use band pass filters at a wavelength of 440 ± 20 nm to excite the SN semiconductor but exclude the excitation of the Au. It is clearly observed that HCAL selectivity is almost unchanged and CAL conversion is slightly reduced due to the decrease in the number of incident photon flux. In contrast, when band pass filter at a wavelength of 520 ± 20 nm is used to excite the Au rather SN semiconductor, the activity is close to that under dark for Au6-Pd1/SN. The SPR effect is thus negligible during CAL photocatalytic hydrogenation. Considering the thermal effect, the catalytic hydrogenation of CAL over Au6-Pd1/SN is performed at different temperatures without light irradiation. As illustrated in Fig. S9, both CAL conversion and HCAL selectivity over Au6-Pd1/SN are gradually promoted with increasing temperature. However, the highest thermal catalytic activity for the catalysts at 80 °C is still lower than that of photocatalytic reaction at room temperature, indicating that photocatalysis has a dominating effect in the catalytic process. Selective hydrogenation of a series of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes over Au6-Pd1/SN is used as a model reaction to test its’ universal applicability in Table 2 . When the substituents in the α and β position of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde are H atom, the steric hindrance of acrolein is minimal, and complete conversion can be achieved in 0.5 h. Moreover, the introduction of the benzene ring in the β position of acrolein, the CAL can also be efficiently converted to HCAL for an extended time. Besides, the H atom in the α position of CAL is replaced by a methyl group, the conversion of α-methylcinnamaldehyde is significantly reduced, and the corresponding saturated aldehyde selectivity becomes poor. The benzene ring further substitutes the H in the β-position of CAL as β-phenylcinnamaldehyde, which is inactive for hydrogenation reaction. As a result, the substituents at the α position of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes are methyl or H atom, the adsorption of the substrate is available, and hydrogenation reaction can be done easily. The stability of the catalyst is vital in the application. After five-run cycling experiments, the catalytic activity of Au6-Pd1/SN keeps stable, as shown in Fig. S10. Besides, XRD and XPS results demonstrate that the crystal structure and surface chemical composition of Au6-Pd1/SN are preserved after the five-run cycling experiments (Fig. S11 and S12). These results indicate that the Au6-Pd1/SN catalyst has high stability during the photocatalytic process. However, the valence states of Sn in Au6-Pd1/SN are changing during the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S13). Table S2 shows the proportion of tin different valence on the catalyst surface, Sn2+ makes up 75.7% for the fresh Au6-Pd1/SN. When the catalyst is irradiated for 1.5 h (half time reaction) and 3 h (completed reaction) during the hydrogenation process, the ratio of Sn2+ decreases to 52.5% and then increases to 100%. After the reaction, the final filtrate is tested by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Au, Pd, and Sn are not detected, further confirming the stability of Au6-Pd1/SN."
11,Photocatalytic mechanisms.,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanisms. Catalysis is a multistep process involving the adsorption of reactants, the transformation of intermediate, and the desorption of products on the catalyst, where the intermediate adducts of the substrate are formed on the active sites to reduce activation energy. The adsorption behaviors of CAL on SN and LSN surface are studied by in situ FTIR. As is depicted in Fig. 6 , evident characteristic bands of CAL are discovered after the adsorption of CAL. Three prominent bands at 1576, 1627, and 1677 cm−1 are attributed to C-C stretching vibration, conjugated CC bond stretching vibration, and CO bond asymmetric stretching vibration of the CAL, respectively, which can be observed on SN after evacuation for 15 min. The band at 1627 cm−1 (νc=c) shifts to a higher wavenumber (1637 cm−1) compared to free CAL molecules, while other characteristic bands remain unchanged. However, these bands disappear on LSN after evacuation, suggesting that the interface reaction between CAL and SN is stronger than that of LSN. Adsorption experiments of CAL on Au/SN, Pd/SN, and Au6-Pd1/SN are further performed as control experiments. As shown in Fig. S14, the shift of the characteristic band of CAL on Au/SN, Pd/SN, and Au6-Pd1/SN is similar to that of SN, indicating that adsorption of CAL can efficiently coordinate with SN via the CC group and is independent of the loaded Au or Pd. Considering the presence of Nb and Sn in SN, CAL may be absorbed on the surface of SN by forming Nb···CC or Sn···CC coordination, which is clarified by revealing changes in the binding energy of SN after absorption of CAL molecules with XPS (Fig. 7 ). There is a lower binding energy shift (0.3 eV) of Nb 3d and a nearly unchanged binding energy shift of Sn 3d, showing the electron migration from CAL to surface Nb and the formation of surface coordination species between CC and Nb atoms. The unoccupied d orbitals of Nb as Lewis acid sites favor the adsorption of electron-donor for CC to form σ-bond through d-π donation. Therefore, the coordination bond is strengthened, making CAL easier to react. Besides, the in-situ FTIR for HCAL absorption (Fig. 8 ) is also implemented to exhibit the interaction between SN and HCAL. The desorption of the formed product is a critical issue for suppressing the over hydrogenation of HCAL. These characteristic bands of HCAL are disappeared after the further evacuation, indicating that the HCAL could easily be desorbed from SN, which is beneficial to the cycle absorption of CAL and high selectivity of HCAL in SN. Influences of coordination species formed by SN and CAL molecules are further investigated with UV-DRS. Fig. S15 shows that the light absorption of SN exhibits an evident redshift after the absorption of CAL, suggesting that interface electron transfer occurs between the nanosheets and CAL. The formed surface coordination of CC···Nb species is highly conducive to the activation of the CC group through interface charge redistribution, and the coordinated and activated CAL can be converted more facilely. A series of control experiments indicate that the conversion of CAL depends considerably on the Pd NPs, which are predominately active sites for the dissociation of H2 to H·. The hydro-oxygen titration for SN, Au/SN, Pd/SN, and Au6-Pd1/SN are implemented to further clarify the ability for H2 dissociation. As shown in Fig. S16a, no clear signals for hydrogen dissociation in SN and Au/SN indicate that SN and Au NPs cannot dissociate and activate H2. These concave peaks are at about 300 °C over Pd/SN and Au6 -Pd1/SN, attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the catalyst [88]. The H2 adsorption capacity is reduced with the abatement of Pd content in Au6-Pd1/SN. The lower desorption area of Au6-Pd1/SN indicates a much weaker interaction between Pd and H2 after loading Au and thereby against hydride formation. H2 chemisorption and interaction between atomic hydrogen with the catalyst surface are also performed with linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV, Fig. S15b). The larger oxidation area of Pd/SN means more absorbed H2, in consistent with the hydro-oxygen titration result. The oxidative potential of Au6-Pd1/SN is 0.27 V lower than that of Pd/SN, showing that Au6-Pd1/SN has weaker interaction to bond hydrogen atoms. These results are mainly attributed to the electron-donating effect of Au. The decrease of H2 adsorption and weakened Pd-H bond contributes to inhibiting the occurrence of over hydrogenation. Thus, the selectivity of HCAL can be improved, and selective hydrogenation activity can be well-tuned. The dissociation of H2 on catalysts is studied using the spin trap N-benzylidene-tret-butylamine N-oxide (PBN) to efficiently gather any loosely bound chemisorbed hydrogen atoms (H·) [89]. Fig. 9 shows the EPR spectra of SN, Au/SN, Pd/SN, and Au6-Pd1/SN. No EPR transitions are detected over SN and Au/SN. These results show that molecular hydrogen is the source of the hydrogen atoms added to the spin trap and that SN and Au/SN are incapable of producing hydrogen atoms under mild conditions. Both Pd/SN and Au6-Pd1/SN give EPR signal with different intensity. With the irradiation of visible light, the concentration of H· significantly enhance. The rich electron density of the Pd NPs injected by the photogenerated electrons is beneficial for the hydrogenation reaction because the dissociation of H2 requires the denotation of d-electrons of Pd to H2. Therefore, the formation of H· will be significantly enhanced, while the formation of Pd-H is highly suppressed. A possible photocatalytic mechanism for selective hydrogenation of CAL to HCAL under visible light irradiation is proposed Scheme 1 . CAL molecules are activated and coordinated on the surface of the nanosheet via forming surface coordination species CC···Nb at the initial stage. Meanwhile, H2 would be dissociated and activated on Pd NPs to produce hydride (Pd-H) and activated H atoms (H·). The H· as active species would reduce CAL molecules to HCAL (Step 1 a). HCAL can be further hydrogenated into undesired products for HCOH by Pd-H species, resulting in low selectivity of HCAL in the dark (Step 1b). Under visible light irradiation (Step 2), electrons in the valance band (VB) are excited to the conduction band (CB) in SN, occurring the simultaneous generation of the hole in the VB. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of SN can be transferred to Au-Pd NPs, and the photogenerated holes remain in the VB. On the one hand, Pd NPs with enriched electrons can efficiently adsorb and dissociate H2 to form H· and Au NPs reduce the over hydrogenation of HCAL by inhibiting the formation of Pd-H species. The H· generated at Pd migrate to the CC group of CAL bounded SN for selective hydrogenation. On the other hand, Sn4+ is oxidized from a portion of Sn2+ in SN by the photogenerated holes, which is useful for inhibiting the styrene formation. The Sn4+ is subsequently reduced to Sn2+ by photogenerated electrons with the aid of active H, which will further improve the separation ability of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Finally, the HCAL can be released from the surface of the catalyst. Since the charge transfer takes place among Au, Pd NPs and the nanosheets, the generating rate of activated H atoms is effectively regulated to avoid excessive hydrogenation. Therefore, synergetic effects between the metal NPs and nanosheets jointly control the conversion of CAL to HCAL with high selectivity."
12,Conclusion,"A multifunctional Au-Pd/SN photocatalyst with several active sites is successfully developed for efficiently selective hydrogenation of CAL to HCAL under visible light. The results suggested that SN provides surface Lewis acid sites to selectively chemisorb the CC bond via forming the CC···Nb coordination. The formation of surface coordination species would activate the CC bond because of interfacial electron redistribution. H2 would be dissociated to H· on Pd NPs with the assistance of photogenerated electrons and Au NPs inhibits over hydrogenation of HCAL. The variation of the valence state of Sn reduces the generation of byproduct styrene. Meanwhile, the H· could directly be transferred to the adsorbed CAL for the formation of HCAL. This study provides a method of designing ultrathin 2D nanosheets and multifunctional photocatalysts using metal NPs, which can help understand how the structure of the catalysts influences performance at the molecular level."
