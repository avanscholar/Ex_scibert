0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is a promising clean energy for our sustainable development [1–3]. Currently, 90% of global H2 gas is produced by steam reforming, however, the process consumes considerable thermal energy and hydrocarbon fuels. Electrocatalytic water splitting is a clean and renewable technology to produce hydrogen but it still requires the smart management of the electrical energy system and the development of low-cost and efficient catalysts instead of noble metals [4,5]. Based on the abundant solar energy, photocatalytic water splitting with a mild reaction condition shows great potential for future low-cost and scalable H2 production [6,7]. Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [8], a burst of interest in photocatalytic H2 evolution has been aroused [9–11]. However, due to the fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole charges, limited visible-light utilization, and sluggish reaction kinetics on general semiconductor photocatalysts, the current state-of-the-art efficiency of photocatalytic H2 production from water is still far from the demand for industrial application (a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 10%). To boost the reaction, a great number of efforts have been made by researchers in this area, including constructing advanced photocatalytic structures [12–14], introducing cocatalysts [15,16], employing electrical bias [17–19], and exploring novel energy hybrid processes [20–22]. Among the various strategies, loading H2 evolution cocatalysts is a facile approach to effectively improve the activity of semiconductors for photocatalytic H2 production from water [23,24]. Till now, a myriad of H2 evolution cocatalysts have been studied [15]. Transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) are the most effective cocatalysts for H2 photocatalytic production. With Fermi energy levels lower than those of most semiconductor photocatalysts, transition metal NPs, especially noble transition metal NPs, can serve as electron traps to dramatically reduce the recombination rate of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs [15]. Besides, some noble metals, particularly Pt, require an extremely low overpotential for H2 evolution and thus can significantly promote the reaction process [25,26]. Moreover, a portion of the transition metal NPs, including Au, Ag, and Cu, exhibit evident surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon, which enables them to have a strong absorption in the visible light region and thus could substantially enhance the utilization of visible light for H2 production [27–30]. Nevertheless, the performance of the mono-metal cocatalysts is still rather limited, and the high cost and inadequate reserve of the noble metals have restricted their widespread application [31]. Alloying two metal species allows the formation of unique microstructures, optimized work functions and exceptional synergetic effects for enhanced catalytic performance [32]. Bimetallic and multi-metallic catalysts have demonstrated great potential in achieving chemical transformations that could be hardly realized by monometallic catalysts [33–35]. Besides, it has been found that the activity, selectivity and resistance to poisoning of a metal catalyst can be strongly affected after it is alloyed with another metal component [36]. Furthermore, the combination of noble metal with non-noble metal species and the development of non-noble bimetallic cocatalysts with comparable or even super performance to that of noble metals could effectively reduce the cost in manufacturing highly efficient photocatalysts. With their distinctive merits, bimetallic alloy NPs have attracted increasing attention as cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production from water in recent years [37–41]. It has been revealed that the structure, size, loading amount and dispersity of a bimetallic cocatalyst all have considerable influence on the photocatalytic activity. To develop advanced H2 production systems using solar energy, it is essential to get a comprehensive understanding of the properties and performance of the currently developed bimetallic cocatalysts. However, up to now, no related review article has been published yet. To master the progress in designing bimetal cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production and promote the development of cocatalyst systems distinct from the conventional monometallic NPs, herein, a concise review on the currently developed bimetallic H2-evolution cocatalysts is constructed. We begin with a brief introduction of the basic principle of the photocatalytic process reaction. Then, the typical structures and general synthesis approaches of bimetallic alloy NPs are delineated, followed by a specific discussion on the screening criteria of bimetallic cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production. In the main section, the bimetallic cocatalysts, including the bi-noble-metal, noble-non-noble bimetal and bi-non-noble-metal systems, for photocatalytic water reduction to H2 are elaborately presented, with an emphasis on their synergetic effects and the factors that affect the properties and activities of the bimetal cocatalysts. Finally, remained challenges and future directions for the development of bimetal alloy cocatalysts are provided."
1,Fundamental of photocatalytic H2 production from water,"A semiconductor possesses separate energy bands. The highest energy band with electron distribution is regarded as the valence band (VB), and the lowest energy level without electron occupation is called the conduction band (CB). The energy gap between VB and CB is deemed as the bandgap (Eg ) of the semiconductor [42]. The main steps of photocatalytic water splitting on a semiconductor photocatalyst are as demonstrated in Fig. 1 [43]. When the energy of incident light equals to or is larger than that of Eg , electrons (e−) in the VB will be excited by the photons and transfer to the CB, leaving holes (h+) in the VB. With the CB location being more negative than the reduction potential of H+ to H2 (0 V vs. RHE), the CB e−, after it migrates to the surface reaction sites, can reduce the adsorbed water molecules or protons to H2. On the other hand, the VB h+ that migrates to the surface will participate in the oxidation of water molecules (with the VB location more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2, i.e., 1.23 V vs. RHE) or the sacrificial agent(s), if present [44]. Nevertheless, considerable overpotentials are generally required to allow the photon-induced charges to transfer fluently to the reactants and trigger the reactions [45]. Besides, the photo-generated charges could recombine easily in the material bulk or on the surface, contributing to low photocatalytic activity and poor quantum efficiency (QE). Moreover, the energy conversion efficiency of a semiconductor photocatalyst is also restricted by the fast backward reactions and the limited utilization of visible light. Cocatalysts deposition is one effective strategy to improve the performance of a photocatalyst for water splitting. Valid reduction or oxidation cocatalysts on the semiconductor photocatalysts are supposed to inhibit the recombination of the photo-excited electron-hole pairs, reduce the overpotential for the redox reactions, enhance the visible light absorption, limit the reverse reactions and thus improve the overall photocatalytic efficiency [12,15]. Cocatalysts are also expected to improve the stability of some vulnerable semiconductors such as metal (oxy)sulfides and (oxy)nitrides [46,47]. Furthermore, for a H2 evolution cocatalyst, a suitable hydrogen adsorption energy and a high selectivity to the reduction reaction are demanded to maximize the H2 evolution reaction rate [4,48]. For semiconductor photocatalysts loaded with cocatalysts, the cocatalysts generally function as the main active sites for the redox reactions. Representative inorganic water oxidation cocatalysts include RuO2, CoO x , Co3(PO4)2, IrO x , and metal-free boron oxynitride cluster etc [15]. On the other hand, nanoparticles of transition metals with high work functions, such as Ni and Pt, are normally selected as H2 evolution cocatalysts. They can serve effectively as both electron traps and proton reduction sites. Besides, some metal oxides (e.g. Rh2−xCrxO3) [12], metal sulfides (e.g. MoS2 [23,49,50] and NiSx [51,52]), metal hydroxide (e.g. Ni(OH)2 [53]), metal carbides (e.g. Ni3C [54]), metal phosphide (e.g. Co1.4Ni0.6P [55] and Cu3P [56]) and biomimetic hydrogenase [15] have been proven efficient H2 evolution cocatalysts. In recent years, bimetallic cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution from water have been attracting increasing attention."
2,Basics of bimetal cocatalysts,"Understanding the basic structures and synthesis protocols of bimetal alloy NPs is the first step for conducting an investigation on bimetallic cocatalysts/catalysts for various applications. In this section, the typical patterns of bimetallic nanoalloys, the general methods for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs loaded catalysts, and the screening criteria for bimetallic H2-evolution photo-cocatalysts are demonstrated"
3,Typical patterns of bimetallic nanoalloys,"3.1 Typical patterns of bimetallic nanoalloys The ordering of the two metals (A and B) in their nanoalloy (AmBn) depends on the synthesis methods, experimental conditions, and the balance of diverse factors, including (1) the relative strengths of A-A, B-B, and A-B bonds, (2) the surface energies of bulk A and B, (3) the relative atomic sizes, (4) the electronegativities of A and B, (5) the bindings of A and B to the support, and (6) specific electronic/magnetic effects [32,57]. There are four representative mixing patterns of bimetallic nanoalloys, as presented in Fig. 2 [57]. The first one pattern is homogeneously mixed alloy, the two metals in which can be either randomly or ordered intermixed (Fig. 2a). This type of structure is likely to form when the bond between the two metal species (i.e. A-B) is stronger or equals to the bonds within each metal (i.e. A-A and B-B) under the synthesis condition [58]. The second is the core–shell structure (Fig. 2b), where one metal particle is covered by the shell of the other metal. Sub-cluster segregated nanoalloys with pseudo-planar interfaces constitute the third category of bimetallic nanoalloy (Fig. 2c). These forms could be obtained when a two-step deposition process is applied, the A-A and B-B bonds are stronger than A-B bonds, or the two metal species are with distinctive sizes [59,60]. The last is the multi-shell nanoalloy (Fig. 2d). This can occur when there is more than one concentric shell covering the core metal to form an “onion-like” structure. In addition, in some cases, two metal cocatalysts are separately located on a photocatalyst but could generate some synergetic effects as well [61]. They are also considered as a type of bimetal cocatalyst system. With the same composition, bimetallic nanoalloys with different mixing patterns could show distinct cocatalytic activities for photocatalytic H2 evolution from water. The optimal mixing pattern may vary as the composition changes. The influence of the mixing pattern for some specific bimetal cocatalyst systems is discussed in Section 4."
4,Approaches for bimetal cocatalyst deposition,"3.2 Approaches for bimetal cocatalyst deposition The synthesis method plays an important role in determining the structure and other properties of a bimetallic cocatalyst. The two elements of a bimetallic NPs can be successively or simultaneously deposited onto the substrate via an in-situ or ex-situ approach. In-situ deposition refers to the processes where the reduction/formation of the metals takes place concurrently with the deposition of the metal species, or where oxides or salts of the metal elements are loaded on the substrate first and then reduced to their metallic forms in a second step. For ex-situ deposition, the metal NPs are pre-obtained via chemical or physical routes and then immobilized onto the supporting material. In-situ deposition is supposed to be able to introduce more intimate contacts between the bimetal cocatalyst and the substrate material, while the ex-situ methods allow an easier control of the properties of the bimetallic crystals. Although the presence of a second metal component increases the complexity of preparation, most of the methods for bimetallic cocatalyst loading are based on the same principle for loading the monometallic cocatalysts. As monometallic NPs, the bimetallic nanoalloys can be independently synthesized or in-situ loaded onto supports from their oxidized or ionized species via some typical reduction processes. Also, they can be acquired physically from their bulk precursors, followed by ex-situ deposition onto selected substrates. 3.2.1 Chemical reduction Because of its convenient operation, chemical reduction is one of the most prevalent methods to obtain metal particles from their corresponding ionic or organic precursors. General chemical reduction processes include reducing the metal-contained species (1) in solution by soluble or liquid chemical reducing agents, such as NaBH4 [39,58,62,63], ethylene glycol [64] and hydrazine hydrate [65], (2) as solid at an elevated temperature (300–450 °C) with a reducing atmosphere (e.g. hydrogen) [66–68], or (3) at an even higher temperature (~700 °C) with carbon as the reducing agent [40]. For the process in solution, a certain time for the adsorption of the metal-contained species (ions or organic compounds) on the substrate surfaces is required if an in-situ deposition is organized [58,69]. If metal/bimetal NPs with small sizes without aggregation in solution are desired, surfactants can be added during the reduction process to regulate the particle size and avoid their agglomeration [60,62]. When using hydrogen for the reduction, the metal species precursors are normally deposited on the semiconductor surface first by solid-state or wet impregnation. 3.2.2 Ultrasound-assisted reduction Ultrasound-assisted reduction, also called sonochemical reduction, utilizes high power ultrasound waves to reduce metal ions simultaneously in a certain solvent to produce metal NPs [70]. When two metal species are concurrently reduced, their nanoalloys could be attained [71]. During the process, the tiny hot spots formed under the irradiation of high-power ultrasound would cause the organic compounds such as alcohols, surfactants, or water-soluble polymers to thermally decompose into radicals, part of which could reduce the metal ions in the solution into the corresponding metal NPs nanoparticles. To maximize the sonochemical reduction effect, the oxygen in the solution should be eliminated. The obtained metal/bimetal NPs can then be deposited onto photocatalysts and serve as cocatalysts in a second step. Or, in-situ bimetal alloy NPs deposition by this method can be carried out by dispersing the substrate materials in the solution before the introduction of the ultrasound irradiation [70]. 3.2.3 Photo-assisted reduction Photoreduction has been long used as an important way to in-situ place metal particles on supports [35,72]. It allows the preparation of bimetallic catalysts in either one step [59,73] or a step-wise routine [37,41,59]. Similar to the sonochemical process, before photoreduction, the oxygen in the system has to be removed as much as possible by inert gases. Both UV and visible irradiation can be used for the reduction, depending on the reducibility of the metal precursors [41]. Besides, photon energy can be employed to generate oxygen vacancies on a semiconductor. Subsequently, the oxygen vacancy-rich semiconductor can reduce the target metal ions (once they contact with each other) and immobilize the reduced metal NPs intimately on its surface [74]. Compared to one-pot photoreduction, this method avoids the formation of un-attached metal NPs and ensures firm contact between the cocatalyst and the photocatalyst. 3.2.4 Radiolysis-induced reduction Radiolysis is an effective approach for preparing metal/bimetal NPs with tunable size, distribution and structure in solutions, heterogeneous media or on supports [75,76]. Upon the irradiation of γ-rays (emitted from 60Co panoramic γ-source), solvated electrons and alcohol radicals are generated to reduce the metal ions to metal clusters/NPs [76]. The as-synthesized NPs are in the form of colloidal particles, which possess huge surface-to-volume ratio and high specific surface area and are ready for ex-situ deposition as cocatalysts [77]. Definitely, by dispersing photocatalyst supports in the precursor solution, in-situ deposition of bimetal cocatalysts could be carried out using radiolysis as well [76]. 3.2.5 Hydro/solvo-thermal reduction Hydro/solvo-thermal reduction is to reduce the metal salt precursors under a reduction atmosphere created by water [78] or an organic solvent (such as dimethylformamide) [38] at a relatively high pressure (sealed in autoclave) and a medium temperature (160–180 °C). Sometimes, to regulate the particle size and exposed facets, surfactants like polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are additionally introduced in the precursor solution [79]. If the metals are reduced with the presence of a photocatalyst, in-situ deposition of the bimetal cocatalyst is realized [38]. Otherwise, the hydro/solvothermally obtained bimetal particles can be ex-situ deposited onto the target materials. Moreover, interestingly, bimetal cocatalyst decorated semiconductors, for example, Cu/Ni-codoped Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoplates, have been well constructed in a one-pot hydrothermal process just with the salts of the metal species (Cu, Ni, Cd and Zn) as well as Na2S in the precursor [80]. Furthermore, other energies, such as microwave irradiation, can be combined with the hydro/solvo-thermal and other processes to enhance the homogeneity and efficiency of the material synthesis [81,82]. 3.2.6 Physical ejection of bimetal alloy NPs Laser ablation [48,83] and plasma sputtering (followed by annealing) [84] are two effective physical approaches to obtain metal/bimetal NPs from their bulk materials. By laser ablation on a target consisting of the objective metals with a certain depth of liquid (which can be pure water or mixtures of isopropanol and water) on top of the target, metal or bimetallic alloy NPs can be ejected [48,83]. The composition of the two metal elements in their alloy NPs could be tuned by varying the target composition or by changing the ratio of isopropanol and water in the liquid. Because the oxidation atmosphere provided by water could inhibit the ejection of some metal species (e.g. Ni) in the plasma plume [48]. Via plasma sputtering, bimetal layers or NPs could be generated on the supports, while further annealing would allow the bimetal layers to split into bimetal NPs [84]."
5,Screening bimetallic cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production,"3.3 Screening bimetallic cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production According to the basic mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production from water, bimetallic cocatalysts are supposed to effectively improve the separation and transfer of photo-generated charges and provide sufficient active sites for water activation and H2 evolution. If randomly picking two metals in the periodic table, there will be hundreds of bimetallic compositions. But only a portion of them will demonstrate exceptional synergistic behaviors and achieve excellent co-catalyzing performance. There will even be less ones with both a high activity and a low cost, which are the most desired. Compared to experimental trials, calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) provide an efficient strategy for large-volume screening bimetallic cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production [85]. First, structural and chemical stability is required for a bimetallic nanoalloy to be a reliable cocatalyst. Before calculation, stable models for the combination of two metals should be established. Theoretically, analyzing the stability of a bimetallic structure also allows the researchers to predict if such as structure can be obtained experimentally [57]. However, due to the complexity of practical situations, some structures that were theoretically unstable may be fabricated in a specific condition or with additional stabilizing forces. To facilitate the transfer of photo-generated charges from the semiconductor photocatalyst to the cocatalysts, the formation of a properly high Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor interface is essential. This requires the bimetallic nanoalloys to possess a suitable work function. The work functions of the various bimetals and monometals can be acquired via DFT calculations. So that, the electron trapping ability of the various bimetallic nanoparticles and that of their corresponding monometallic systems can be compared [37]. In electrocatalysis, the active site with a hydrogen binding Gibbs energy (ΔGH*) closest to zero shows the best H2 evolution performance, which is known as the Sabatier principle [86]. Bernhard and coworkers calculated the hydrogen binding energies of a series of bimetallic nanoalloys and found that the electrocatalytic Sabatier principle was applicable to the photocatalytic H2 production as well [87]. Thus, the hydrogen binding energy of each potential bimetallic cocatalyst can be calculated and used as an important factor to predict their cocatalytic performance for photocatalytic H2 production from water."
6,Bimetallic cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production from water,"With the increasing interest on bimetal cocatalysts in various catalytic processes, bi-noble-metal, noble-non-noble bimetal and bi-non-noble-metal alloy cocatalysts for photocatalytic reduction of water to H2 have been developed. Table 1 lists the representative bimetal cocatalysts and their performance for photocatalytic H2 production from water after decorated on photocatalysts."
7,Bi-noble-metal cocatalysts,"4.1 Bi-noble-metal cocatalysts Due to their low Fermi levels, noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag, are frequently applied as efficient cocatalysts to trap the photo-generated electrons with the formation of Schottky barrier at the metal/semiconductor interface, thus inhibiting the fast recombination of photo-generated charge carrier and dramatically enhancing the photocatalytic performance [88]. Besides, some noble metals like Au and Ag exhibit significant surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) effect, which could enhance the light absorption especially in the visible light range and generate intense electric fields near the metal surface [83,89]. The alloying of two noble metals could result in a synergetic effect, which allows the metal alloy to overperform each of the monometals. 4.1.1 Plasmonic bi-noble-metal cocatalysts As mentioned above, plasmonic noble metals (Au and Ag, etc.), when serving as cocatalysts, could enhance the visible light utilization of the semiconductor photocatalyst via their strong SPR effect. Bi-noble-metal alloys based on these plasmonic metals possess not only the synergistic effect of the two metal species but also the plasmonic effect v. The alloys of Au and Ag constitute double-plasmonic-metal cocatalysts with both synergistic catalytic and synergistic plasmonic effects. The absorption band can be tuned by plasmon hybridization through regulating the proportion of Ag and Au in Agx-Au1-x NPs [37]. Meanwhile, the Schottky barrier height at the interface of Agx-Au1−x NPs and the semiconductor could be adjusted by adapting the Ag-Au metal alloy composition. Thus, the overall metal loading amount and the atomic ratio of Au and Ag in the alloy shed a big influence on the photocatalytic performance of Au-Ag bimetallic cocatalysts. Chiarello et al. [62] indicated that 1.0 wt% Au–1.0 wt% Ag modified TiO2-based photocatalyst showed a decreased photocatalytic activity compared to merely Au NPs loaded TiO2. However, for Au-Ag alloy NPs decorated ZnIn2S4 with a lower total loading amount (1 wt%) of Au and Ag, the performance of the alloy involved catalysts (Ag0.8Au0.2, Ag0.6Au0.4, Ag0.4Au0.6 and Ag0.2Au0.8) all exceeded that of solely Au or Ag deposited one (Fig. 3 ) [37]. The optimal photocurrent density and the catalytic activity were attained when the ratio of Ag/Au reached 0.6/0.4. The primary synergetic contributions of the Au-Ag alloy NPs include (1) trapping the electrons and retarding them transferring back to ZIS through the formation of properly high Schottky barrier, (2) facilitating the electron transfer with the difference between the work functions of Au and Ag, and (3) enhancing the visible-light utilization via the synergetic SPR effect [37,90]. Pt shows a low over voltage for water splitting with favorable kinetics but it does not show SPR effect in the visible light. When alloying Pt with Au, the strong SPR adsorption of Au NPs peaked at 516 nm reduces gradually with the increasing amount of Pt and even disappears after the amount of Pt exceeds 50% (Fig. 4 a) [83]. The impaired light absorption could reduce the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. The case is the same when Pd is alloyed with Au or Ag [71]. However, the introduction of the non-plasmonic noble metals (Pt, Pd, etc.) into the photocatalyst system with Au/Ag could help improve hydrogen evolution and induce the synergetic effects between Pt/Pd and Au/Ag. The synergetic effects could lie in various aspects, which have not been fully understood. One indication of the synergetic effect is the realignment of the work function when the two metals are alloyed. An efficient separation of the electron-hole charges relies on a high Schottky barrier, whereas the electron transfer from TiO2 to the metal could be inhibited if the Schottky barrier is too high. A proper work function of the metal cocatalyst, which defines the optimal height of Schottky barrier at the metal–semiconductor interface, is critically important for prolonging the lifetime of the photo-generated charges. As shown in Fig. 4b-c, the Schottky barrier height at the Pt@TiO2 junction is as high as 1.7 eV according to the work function (Φ) of Pt (5.7 eV) and the electron affinity (χ) of TiO2 CB (3.8 eV), while that of Ag@TiO2 (0.2 eV) is much lower due to the smaller work function of Ag (4.26 eV). When TiO2 is loaded with Ag/Pt alloy NPs, a more favorable height of Schottky barrier is obtained, which optimizes the efficiency of charge transfer and separation and maximizes the photocatalytic activity [74]. Such contradicting roles of the second metal in this type of plasmonic bi-noble-metal cocatalysts render interesting phenomena when they are used for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under different conditions. Typically, Montes et al. found that under 532 nm monochromatic visible light, the introduction of Pt to Au/TiO2 resulted in a significant decrease of the photocatalytic activity in pure water (Fig. 5 a) but no obvious influence on the activity with the presence of methanol as a sacrificial agent (Fig. 5b) [66]. When UV-light irradiation was applied, photocatalysts with a higher Pt proportion turned out to be more efficient (Fig. 5c). Under the irradiation of a solar simulator, the catalyst with an appropriate proportion (21.8 wt%) of Pt in the Au–Pt nanoalloy appeared to be most efficient (Fig. 5d). It could be explained that when UV light is used for excitation, photons are mainly absorbed by TiO2 and the presence of a large percentage of Pt in the nanoalloy is beneficial because it accelerates hydrogen evolution. More comprehensively, Wang et al. [63] revealed that the promoted photocatalytic activity on fine Au-Pt alloyed metal nanoparticles (compared to the single metals) under UV light is ascribed to the stronger metal–support interaction between the alloyed structures and the TiO2 substrate, the higher amount of electrons, and the significantly improved charge separation. Besides, it was found that deposition of the metal NPs only promoted the reaction rate without changing the reaction pathways. In contrast, under the irradiation of visible light, photons are absorbed by Au NPs [66]. In this case, when hydrogen evolution is not the controlling step (i.e. in pure water system), the presence of Pt would deteriorate the light adsorption and reduce the activity. When the promoted hydrogen evolution rate by Pt NPs could compensate for the efficiency loss due to reduced light adsorption in the water-methanol system, the activity would not vary much with the addition of Pt. As for the situation with the illumination of simulated sunlight, the balance between the visible light absorption disfavored by Pt and the hydrogen evolution promoted by Pt led to an optimal Pt NPs loading in the nanoalloy [66]. Gopinath and coworkers also demonstrated that under simulated AM1.5G sunlight, Pt0.5-Au1/TiO2 with ~30% Pt in the Pt-Au alloy exhibited the maximal H2 yield of ~1.3 mmol h−1 g−1 and apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 6.4% in a water splitting system with methanol as a sacrificial agent [91]. Besides, the catalyst was highly stable and showed an AQY of 0.8% for overall photocatalytic water splitting. In-depth investigation uncovered that Au interacted predominantly with oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surfaces, while Pt helped with the effective electron-hole pair separation at the Pt-Au interfaces, the electron storage in the metal particles and the suppression of the undesirable oxygen reduction reaction. Nevertheless, the rule changes when a visible-light responsive semiconductor becomes the photocatalyst base [73,83]. For example, Ding et al. [73] synthesized 0.5 wt% Au-Pt/CaIn2S4 composites and found under visible light, the Au-Pt alloy NPs loaded catalyst attained a H2 yield 4 times higher than that of solely Au or Pt loaded one. Xu et al. reported that the photocatalytic performance of Pt/C3N4 surpassed that of Au/C3N4, and the Pt-Au alloys loaded C3N4 showed even better activities under visible light irradiation, as exhibited in Fig. 5e [83]. Similarly, the Pt-Au/g-C3N4 hybrid material synthesized by Bhunia et al. via a facile solvothermal method delivered the optimal H2 production of 1.009 mmol g−1h−1 (10 times that of the pristine g-C3N4) when the ratio of Pt: Au reached 1:1 [38]. Also, the SPR role of Ag and electron trapping function of Pd worked harmoniously in 1 wt% Pd0.7Ag0.3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst, leading to a H2 generation rate (1.25 mmol h−1 g−1) 1.5 and 5.7 times higher than those of the Pd/g-C3N4 and Ag/g-C3N4, respectively, under direct solar light irradiation [69]. However, the underlying reason for the different rules in the photocatalytic performance of the different types of metal-alloy-deposited semiconductors, which could be the intrinsic difference of the semiconductors and their interactions with the metal cocatalysts, remains to be explored. Furthermore, the performance of the bimetal cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution could be altered by changing the deposition sequence, the synthesis method, and the property of the semiconductor base. Baia, Pap and coworkers elaborately studied the properties and performance of AuPt loaded TiO2 catalysts synthesized by in-situ or impregnation method in different orders (Au/Pt, Pt/Au, or Au–Pt simultaneously) on three types of TiO2, i.e. Evonik Aeroxide P25 (P25), Aldrich anatase (AA) and Aldrich rutile (AR) [92]. The H2 evolution performances were shown in Fig. 6 . P25 with Pt/Au deposited in sequence by impregnation method exhibited the highest H2 production of 1567 μmol of H2 in 2 h with 1 g L−1 oxalic acid solution as the sacrificial agent under UV light. Apart from the best one, the samples with simultaneous deposition of Pt and Au generally showed advanced performance on most of the TiO2 bases, which was also suggested in Melvin et al.’s work [91]. In addition, Pt-Au/TiO2 fabricated by photoreduction showed better photocatalytic performance than that obtained by hydrogen reduction, probably due to the more intimate contact between the semiconductor and the metallic alloys in the photo-reduced sample [73]. These differences could stem of the composites from their different homogeneities, crystal sizes, geometrical structures and optical properties, etc. The size and structure of the bimetal alloys are vital in determining their performance as cocatalysts. Small particle size is always more desirable for a cocatalyst to maximize the number of active sites and the utilization of the metals. To uniformly deposite fine AgPt bimetallic cocatalyst on TiO2, Jiang et al. [74] engineered the TiO2 base into single-crystalline anatase hollow nano-hemispheres with rich active sites. Resultantly, bimetallic Ag/Pt NPs with size less than 5 nm were uniformly loaded on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the nano-hemispheres and played an important role in improving visible-light-harvesting, inhibiting the electron-hole recombination, and thus promoting the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. In terms of the structural effect, core–shell Au@Pd NPs loaded TiO2 was found to exhibit a higher performance under visible light than TiO2 with random Au-Pt alloy NPs or a physical mixture of Au and Pd NPs. However, under the irradiation of UV light, the random alloy NPs decorated sample showed the best performance [71]. Additionally, since the plasmonic bimetal cocatalysts are both catalytic and plasmonic in the visible range, it is important to distinguish the contributions of the alloy synergetic effect and the plasmonic effect. Based on investigations on nanocomposites consisting of Pt, Au and C3N4, Xu et al. indicated that the contribution from the synergistic effect was at least 3.5 times that from the plasmonic effect in Pt50Au50/C3N4 which exhibited the best performance with a TOF > 1.6 mmol h−1 g−1 at room temperature and a high stability under visible light irradiation [83]. Specifically, for Pt50Au50/C3N4 and the physical mixture of Pt50/C3N4 and Au50/C3N4, the absorption of the former was estimated to be about 0.9 times weaker than the later under the irradiation of 420–1200 nm light, but the H2 evolution rate on Pt50Au50/C3N4 was twice that of the later one. 4.1.2 Non-plasmonic bi-noble-metal cocatalysts Both Pt and Pd are non-plasmonic. The combination of the two noble metals results in non-plasmonic bi-noble metal cocatalysts with particular synergetic interactions, which make their co-catalytic performance surpass that of either mono-Pt or mono-Pd cocatalyst [93]. Li et al. [60] prepared Pt-Pd bimetal NPs by two-step chemical reduction in 2016, and used them as cocatalysts for CdS in hydrogen generation from water-splitting under visible light. They found a significant improvement of H2 evolution rate, owing to the higher surface energy provided by the bimetallic structure. The so-obtained Pt-Pd hybrid NPs showed a twin structure with sizes of 5–8 nm and are composed of mainly metallic Pt0 and Pd0. The lifetime of photo-excited charges on CdS was also prolonged after the combination of Pt and Pd NPs. Generally, both Pt and Pd nano-crystals could play an important role in trapping the photo-generated electrons for proton reduction. But in this case, since the interface of Pt-Pd hybrid NPs was of higher energy, the photo-generated electrons were more likely to transfer to the interfaces of Pt-Pd NPs with increased separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, thus significantly promoting the hydrogen generation rate of CdS photocatalyst (Fig. 7 a). Caudillo-Flores, U. et al. [39] studied the performance of Pt-Pd bimetal NPs (1.4–1.7 nm) on Nb-doped TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 production from water with methanol as the sacrificial agent. During the reaction, Pd was partially oxidized and the surfaces of Pt-Pd alloy particles became Pt-rich. The alloy Nps with a Pt:Pd atomic ratio of 1 provided the best activity both under UV and visible light illumination (Fig. 7 b-c). Notably, the visible-light activity of 1:1Pt-Pd alloy NPs far surpassed those of monometallic Pt or Pd samples (by factors of 11.5 and 267, respectively), indicating the exceptional synergetic effect between Pt and Pd under visible light irradiation. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to elucidate the mechanism of the strong visible-light synergetic effect."
8,Noble-non-noble bimetal cocatalysts,"4.2 Noble-non-noble bimetal cocatalysts Due to the limited reserves and high price of noble metals, extensive efforts have been devoted to maintaining the catalytic performance with less amount of noble metals. One of the effective strategies is to alloy the noble metals with low-cost and abundant non-noble transition metals, such as Ni [76], Co [64], Cu [58,59] and Sn [79]. Impressively, many of the noble-non-noble bimetal alloy NPs have functioned as efficient cocatalysts outperforming the noble metals in photocatalytic H2 evolution from water. PtCo alloy cocatalyst has been investigated to effectively promote the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers in g-C3N4 [64]. With the formation of 3–5 nm crystalline PtCo NPs on g-C3N4 by the ethylene glycol reduction method (Fig. 8 a), the binding energy of Pt 4f in the sample shifted to higher values (Fig. 8b). The different structures and electronic density of states of the binary alloy NPs from those of the single metal NPs increased the number of surface defects, changed the Fermi energy level and thus enhanced the electron transfer driving force from g-C3N4 to the metal cocatalyst (Fig. 8c). On the other side, the introduction of Co into Pt decreased the number of Pt active sites that are more favorable for H2 evolution. Thereby, an optimal ratio of Pt to Co (1:1) and an optimum overall metal loading amount (1 wt%) were obtained. Accordingly, the 1.0 wt%PtCo/g-C3N4 presented the maximal H2 evolution rate of 960 mmol h−1g−1, which was 2.9 times that of pristine Pt/g-C3N4 (Fig. 8d). Yuan et al. synthesized Pt-Ni bimetal cocatalysts to effectively improve the photo-generated charge separation and proton reduction on conjugated polymer nanostructures (CPNs), polypyrrole (PPy) [76]. As shown in Fig. 8e and f, Pt-Ni-PPy demonstrated significantly higher H2 production than its monometallic counterparts, and the loading amount was critically important for the high performance. The advantage of the bimetal alloy lay in the synergy between the promoted electron trapping and proton formation by Pt and the facilitated H2 generation by Ni (Fig. 8g). The combinations of Sn and Pt or Pd have also been found appealing for co-catalyzing photocatalytic H2 production from water. Yao and coworkers successfully engineered (110) facet exposed Pt3Sn nano-cube cocatalysts on CdS, which exhibited an outstanding activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution and a record-high quantum efficiency of 86% at 420 nm [79]. The photocatalytic activity of the bimetal alloy cocatalysts was closely related to the exposed facets of the alloy NPs. Generally, high-energy crystal facets are favorable for the reduced activation energy. Among the low-index crystalline facets of Pt3Sn nano-cube, the (110) facet showed higher catalytic performance than (111) and (100) facets. Very recently, Bernhard and coworkers uncovered the great potential of Pd/Sn bimetallic cocatalysts, which exhibited the best synergistic behavior and H2 evolution among the investigated bimetallic systems (Pd/Sn, Pd/Mo, Pd/Ru, Pd/Pb, Pd/Ni, Ni/Sn, Mo/Sn, and Pt/Sn) [87]. Computational study indicated that the best sample was with ΔGH* of −0.036 eV, confirming its high activity of H2 evolution. In addition, exceptional performance could be acquired when Au or Ag is alloyed with Cu [58,59]. The structure of the bimetal alloy NPs could shed significant influence on the activity. Typically, AuCu mixed alloy NPs showed advanced light absorption, charge separation and H2 production compared to AuCu core–shell structures [59]. CaIn2S4 (CIS) deposited with the former type for AuCu alloy NPs with an Au:Cu ratio of 4:1 demonstrated a notable hydrogen production rate of 452.8 μmol h−1, which was 2.2, 10.0, 63.8 and 76.7 times higher than that of core–shell Cu1/Au4/CIS, Au5/CIS, Cu5/CIS and the pristine CaIn2S4, respectively. The SPR effect of Au played an important role in promoting the photocatalytic reaction and thus the photocatalytic performance of AuCu/CaIn2S4 composites was wavelength-dependent. Also, remarkable synergetic effect was observed on the highly stable mixed alloy NPs of Ag and Cu [58]. The Ag–Cu/C3N4 nanotube catalysts showed sufficient visible light absorption and significantly suppressed electron–hole recombination, leading to a H2 photocatalytic evolution activity considerably higher than that of Pt/C3N4 nanotubes."
9,Bi-non-noble-metal cocatalysts,"4.3 Bi-non-noble-metal cocatalysts To obtain cheap, efficient and durable cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution, low-cost non-noble transition metals like Ni, Cu, Co and Mo, etc. have received much attention. However, the performance of single non-noble transition metal cocatalysts is rather limited and they show poor long-term stability due to their easy oxidation. Proper combination of the metals allows the optimization of the metal properties and could lead to a durable performance exceeding that of noble metals. Ni is an efficient cocatalyst for H2 production in photocatalysis [94]. The work function and H atom adsorption energy of Ni are 5.15 eV and 2.29 eV, respectively, indicating its advantages in trapping the photo-generated electrons and adsorbing protons. However, H2 desorption is not very efficient on Ni with a H2 adsorption energy of 0.102 eV. Cu, though less favorable for H adsorption and photoelectron trapping than Ni, can release H2 molecules easily with a H2 molecule adsorption energy as low as 0.001. By using laser ablation in liquid (LAL), Yang and coworker designed CuNi alloy NPs with a more desirable work function as well as hydrogen adsorption energies for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution (Fig. 9 a-b) [48]. The Cu63Ni37 alloy NPs deposited sample attained the best H2 yield, which even exceeded that of the Pt loaded catalyst (Fig. 9c-d). Moreover, Cu63Ni37 NPs showed substantially higher durability than Cu and Ni NPs. The activity of TiO2/Cu63Ni37 showed only a little variation after four 5-h reaction cycles probably due to the mass loss during re-collection at the cycling interval. Analogously, Cu/Ni@Ni core–shell structures were deposited on TiO2 (P25) via a facile hydrothermal approach and outperformed the corresponding single metals both in activity and stability for photocatalytic H2 production in water-methanol solution [78]. With the optimum conditions (Cu/Ni ratio of 1:1, overall metal loading of 1%, hydrothermal temperature of 150 °C and time of 3 h, 37.5% methanol solution with a pH of 7.7), the H2 production rate on Cu and Ni co-modified TiO2 reached up to 13.5 mmol h−1 g−1 in the first 5-h cycle, maintained in the second cycles, and remained at 4.62 mmol h−1 g−1 in the 8th cycle. The appreciable performance was ascribed to the enhanced charge transfer and the highly active sites, which were realized by the synergy of Cu and Ni in the CuNi bimetallic alloy. Besides, the interface between Cu/Ni alloy and Ni shell was found especially important for promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution process. Spanu et al. deposited NiCu bimetal NPs onto TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) by plasma sputtering NiCu bilayer, followed by thermal treatment, which drove the metal bilayer splitting into bimetal alloy NPs [84]. Via this approach, the particle size, distribution and composition of cocatalyst can be well manipulated to achieve the optimal activity. As shown in Fig. 9e, the highest photocatalytic activity was reached by TiO2 NTs decorated by 5 nm Ni–5 nm Cu bilayer (“5Ni5Cu-TiO2”), which was ~14 and ~4 times higher than that of “10Ni” (0.44 μLh−1 cm−2) and “10Cu”(1.62 μLh−1 cm−2), respectively. Also, the sputter deposition sequence of Ni and Cu metal films slightly affected the activity, according to the different performances of 5Ni5Cu and 5Cu5Ni. Meanwhile, the annealing temperature was essential in determining the structure and distribution of the NiCu alloy NPs (Fig. 9f). After treated in Ar at 400 °C, the composite of Ni and Cu remained in layered structure and exhibited a relatively low H2 generation rate. Upon annealing–dewetting at 450 °C, not only TiO2 surface was exposed for light adsorption and ethanol oxidation, but also Ni-Cu bimetal NPs with large surface areas were formed for electron trapping and hydrogen evolution. However, annealing at a higher temperature (500 °C) resulted in a reduced activity, which could be due to the formation of an excessive amount of rutile TiO2. Cu and Ni have also been simultaneously and uniformly deposited on TiO2 by Nadeem and coworkers using Cu- and Ni-based cyanide-bridged coordination polymer as the precursor, followed by calcination and H2 reduction [67]. With the combined contributions of Ni and Cu, 1.0 wt% Cu–Ni/TiO2-470 (470 was the calcination temperature) photocatalyst exhibited the maximum H2 evolution rate of 8.5 mmol h−1 g−1 in 20 vol% glycerol/water mixture. Nevertheless, after more than 3 cycles, a slight rate decrease was observed, which was suggested to be casued by the gradual clinging of catalyst particles on the reactor walls. Other Ni based bi-non-noble metal cocatalyst systems have also been explored, including Ni-Co [95,96], Ni-Cd [97], and Ni-Mo [68]. Via the synergy between Ni and Co, Ni0.8Co0.2 bimetal NPs decorated Zn0.75Cd0.25S (ZCS) showed a much higher activity than Pt/ZCS (1%), achieving 0.21 mol h−1 g−1 H2 under simulated solar light irradiation [95]. The pronounced synergetic effect between the two non-noble-metals (Ni and Co) boosted the transfer and separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of NixCo1-x/ZCS kept stable in the test of 3 h, indicating its high stability. Similarly, with CoNi accelerating the charge migration and inhibiting the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers, an efficient and highly stable photocatalytic H2 production (3.3 mmol·h−1) was achieved on 1 wt% Co3Ni2-ZIS, while the 0.6 wt% Co-ZIS and 0.4 wt% Ni-ZIS samples displayed H2 evolution rates of 0.93 and 1.63 mmol·h−1, respectively [96]. Also, Ni-Cd bimetallic cocatalysts have been reported to efficiently inhibit the recombination of the photo-induced electron-hole pairs and promote the interfacial charge transfer, resulting in a significant improvement in the photocatalytic H2 production performance [97]. Ni-Cd/CdS NRs exhibited an excellent and stable photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 11.57 mmol·h−1·g−1 under visible light irradiation, which was about 64.8, 17.2 and 2.3 times those of pristine CdS NRs, Cd/CdS and Ni/CdS, respectively. Moreover, with a high electronic conductivity and a low overpotential, Ni-Mo alloy NPs showed an electrocatalytic H2 evolution performance similar to that of Pt and therefore could serve as an efficient cocatalyst for the corresponding photocatalytic process [68]. The Ni0.4Mo0.6 NPs/g-C3N4 with an optimized metal content of 10% attained a visible-light H2 generation (1.79 mmol g−1h−1) ~37 times that of pure g-C3N4 and comparable to that of Pt/g-C3N4. Additionally, almost no decrease in H2 production was observed after 5 reaction cycles under the irradiation of either simulated sunlight or visible light. In addition, some bi-non-noble metal alloy cocatalysts with Fe have demonstrated their promise as well. The synergistic effect between Fe and Cu in FeCu alloy NPs was reported by Zhang and coworkers [40]. Graphitied carbon-coated bimetallic FeCu NPs (FeCu@C) on g-C3N4 showed significantly improved visible-light photocatalytic H2 evolution (0.72 mmol h−1g−1) compared to the pristine g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 decorated with Fe@C (0.25 mmol h−1g−1) and Cu@C (0.54 mmol h−1 g−1) NPs. In this catalytic system, while the FeCu alloy acted as the catalytically active center to capture photogenerated carriers, the coating of the graphitied carbon layer effectively enhanced the stability of FeCu alloy NPs and accelerated electron transfer. FeNi [98] and FeCo [99] combined with N-doped graphitized carbon (NGC) demonstrated as photocatalytic cocatalysts. For visible-light photocatalytic H2 production from water with triethanolamine as sacrificial agent, the optimal FeNi@NGC loaded g-C3N4 (FNC15) photocatalyst exhibited a H2 evolution rate of 2.696 mmol g−1 h−1 (with 10 mg catalyst), which was >283 times that of pristine g-C3N4 and surpassed than that of 1.0 wt% Pt/g-C3N4 [98]. g-C3N4 with FeCo@NGC cocatalysts showed a visible light driven photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (42.2 μmol h−1) exceeding that of 1.0 wt% Pt modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst as well [99]. The excellent performances of both cocatalysts were attributed to the fast charge transfer facilitated by the FeCo or FeNi alloy nanoparticles and the favorable H adsorption energy adjusted by the external NGC thin layer. Besides, the external NGC layer effectively enhanced the thermal and chemical stability of the Fe-contained alloys, leading to their stable and high activities."
10,Conclusion and perspective,"Compared to the conventional mono-metal cocatalyst systems, bimetal alloy nanoparticles have demonstrated great potential as superbly efficient cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution from water. The most encouraging is the observation of the superior cocatalytic ability of the bi-non-noble-metal cocatalysts (Ni in combination with Cu, Fe, Co, Mn, Sn, and Mo, etc.) to that of noble metal-involved cocatalysts. Nevertheless, challenges remain in understanding the synergetic mechanism and for future practical applications. Several stimulating directions based on the bi/multi-metal systems can be explored in the future to drive the prosperous development of photocatalytic technology for sustainable H2 production. Particularly, although a series of bimetal cocatalysts have been explored, the underlying mechanisms for the synergetic effects and the rules that how the preparation methods, the ratio of the two metals, and the overall loading amount affect the photocatalytic activity have not been fully elucidated. A few researchers suggested Cu based plasmonic bimetal NPs could function as non-semiconductor photocatalysts for advanced H2 photoproduction [100–102]. Further understanding of the working principles could help reveal the exact roles of bimetal cocatalysts and construct more advanced bimetal cocatalysts. Besides, more efforts can be paid in revealing the potential of the remaining bimetallic combinations in the periodic table via smart cooperation of theoretical and experimental approaches. Also, cocatalysts constituted by three or more metal species could demonstrate more interesting features but have not been applied for photocatalytic water splitting yet. Furthermore, the activity and durability of bimetal, especially bi-non-noble-metal, cocatalyst loaded photocatalysts can be further improved by coupling with other modification strategies. For instance, supporting materials with well-organized 3D structures [103] or unique features [104] can be further introduced into the cocatalyst-photocatalyst system to tune their dispersion and optimize the catalytic performance. Heterojunctions, especially z-scheme structures, with bimetallic cocatalysts can be widely explored. While considerable progress has been made in these directions, further attention should be drawn on hybrid systems with exceptional synergistic effects. In addition, single atom catalysts have received enormous attention in recent years for their advanced activity and maximized utilization of the metal atoms [105,106]. Some single atom cocatalysts (SACs), such as Pt SACs [25,107,108], Pd SACs [109] and Ni SACs [110] have been successfully loaded on semiconductor photocatalysts and exhibited excellent capabilities in promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions. In this light, single atom alloys [111] loaded on water splitting photocatalysts, which have not yet been investigated, may open up another new avenue toward highly efficient photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production. Last but not the least, compared to mono-metal cocatalysts, it will be more difficult to scale up the synthesis and utilization of bimetallic cocatalysts due to the more sophisticated compositions and structures. Green and sustainable bimetal-loading methods with a high controllability and a low cost are critical for the future widespread application of the bimetallic cocatalysts. Novel and efficient methods, such as joule heating [112,113] and molten-salt-assisted reduction [114,115], can be specifically explored to enhance the potential of the bimetallic H2-evolution cocatalysts for industrial application."
