0,Introduction,"The growth of the global energy consumption together with the depletion of the crude reserves and more stringent environmental regulations has led to an increasing interest in the need to find alternatives to fossil fuels. In the last decade, non-fossil carbon resources have emerged as renewable energy sources to obtain fuels and chemicals using more available feedstock and generating lower greenhouse emissions [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant and economical non-fossil carbon resource. In addition, lignocellulose is not competitive with the food chain; thus, it is considered to be the most carbon-sustainable source [2,3]. Lignocellulosic biomass is formed by cellulose (40–50%), lignin (15–25%) and hemicellulose (20–35%). The hemicellulose is mainly composed of pentosans and xylans, which after an initial hydrolysis step are dehydrated to furfural [1,4,5]. Furfural is the main chemical, aside from bioethanol, obtained from the lignocellulosic biomass. Currently, its annual production is approximately 280,000 Tm, being the only commercial building block from lignocellulose due to its high versatility for the synthesis of a variety of chemicals [6,7], such as linear alkanes, furoic acid, maleic acid, furan, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and mainly furfuryl alcohol. In addition, furfural itself is used in resin production, as an extracting agent of aromatic compounds of lubricants, as well as a fungicide, nematocide and an adhesive [3,8]. The catalytic hydrogenation of furfural, using metal-based catalysts, is a strategic and optimal industrial source for the production of a wide range of high value-added derivatives. Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is the most common product obtained in the hydrogenation of furfural. FOL is an important chemical with an application in the manufacture of foundry resins with excellent chemical, thermal and mechanical properties. FOL is also used in the manufacture of furan fibre-reinforced plastics for the use as synthetic fibres or rubbers-resins and of farm chemicals or chemical intermediates in the manufacture of lysine, vitamin C and dispersing agents [9,10]. In addition, many other compounds derived from secondary reactions, such as hydrogenolysis of the C–O bond, decarbonylation, hydrogenation and furan ring opening, may appear. Some of these secondary products find interesting applications, e.g., tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) is considered to be a green solvent in agricultural applications, printing inks, industrial and electronic cleaners [10], and 2-methylfuran is a promising biofuel component mixed with gasoline, as well as a solvent for the production of antimalarial drugs, methylfurfural, and nitrogen and sulphur heterocycles [1,10,11]. The synthesis of these high value-added products can be obtained under liquid and gas phase conditions. The hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid phase has been widely tested, using transition metals or amorphous alloys of Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Pd, Pt or Ru as the active phase [12–22]. However, the hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid phase is not environmentally friendly owing to the involvement of additional solvents and also toxic wastes coming from the ring opening of furfural. In addition, the hydrogenation in the liquid phase requires a high hydrogen pressure, which raises the cost of the process. The use of gas phase in the hydrogenation of furfural can overcome drawbacks associated with the high operating costs of using batch reactors in the liquid phase, the expensive equipment required for working at high H2 pressure, and the elapsing time between successive reaction cycles. Traditionally, the furan industry has used copper chromite as the catalyst for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol [23]. The high toxicity of the chromium species has led to the development of new Cr-free catalytic systems using Cu, Ni, Co, Pd or Pt [24–32] as an alternative to the traditional copper chromite. The main drawbacks in the hydrogenation of furfural in the gas phase are related to the selection of an adequate catalyst. That is, a catalyst with a high hydrogenating activity, such as Pt, Pd or even Ni, can open the furanic ring [28,29,31]. However, a catalyst with a lower hydrogenating character such as Cu maintains the furanic structure leading to furan derivative products, such as mostly furfuryl alcohol and also 2-methylfuran. Another limitation of this catalytic process is the deactivation of the catalyst resulting from several factors, such as coke formation, change in the oxidation state, and sintering of metal particles during the reaction process [33]. Thus, the dispersion of metal species seems to be a key factor for resisting deactivation and allowing these catalysts to become alternatives to the traditional copper chromite. The aim of this research was to examine the use of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural in the gas phase. This catalytic system is more environmentally friendly than the traditional copper chromite. The use of an amphoteric oxide such as ZnO can modify the electronic density and the dispersion of metallic copper, which could improve the catalytic activity and resistance to deactivation [34]. This work evaluates the influence of several factors, such as the Cu/Zn atomic ratio, dispersion of the active phase, reaction temperature and contact time."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of Cu/ZnO catalysts was prepared by the coprecipitation method [35] with different copper:zinc molar ratios. It is well known that by applying this methodology, it is possible to obtain a good mixture of both metallic oxides after thermal decomposition [36]. Coprecipitation was performed at 323K by simultaneous mixing aqueous solutions of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Fluka, 98–100%) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Fluka, ⩾ 99%) (0.3M of the total metal concentration, with variable Cu/Zn molar ratios), with 0.5M sodium carbonate (Fluka, ⩾ 99%) under conditions of low oversaturation at a constant pH (pH=7). The addition rate of the precipitant agent (Na2CO3) was controlled by a pHStato (Mettler Toledo DL50) instrument to adjust the desired pH in the mother liquor. After complete addition of the solutions, the resulting precipitates were aged under continuous stirring in the mother liquor at 323K for 4h. After cooling, the precipitates were aged at room temperature for 12h. The suspensions were purged out of the glass reactor followed by separation of the precipitates by vacuum filtration. Then, the solids were washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove traces of sodium until the conductivity of the washed water was similar to that of distilled water (ca. 2μScm−1). Afterwards, the obtained precipitates were dried for 12h at 363K and calcined at 673K (100mLmin−1, O2/Ar 20% v/v) for 1h with a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. Samples were labelled as CuZnO-x, where x is the Cu/Zn molar ratio, as determined by TXRF."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were obtained in a PAN analytical X́Pert Pro automated diffractometer. Powder patterns were recorded in the Bragg–Brentano reflection configuration using a Ge (111) primary monochromator (Cu Kα1) and an X’Celerator detector with a step size of 0.017° (2θ), between 10° and 70° in 2θ with an equivalent counting time of 712 s/step. The crystallite size (D) was calculated using the Williamson–Hall equation, B cos θ =(Kλ/D)+(2 ε sin θ), where θ is the Bragg angle, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks, K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray and ε is the lattice strain [37]. Evolved gas analysis by mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) was performed by loading a sample (ca. 0.1g) in a U-shaped quartz reactor connected to a Balzer PrismaTM quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS 200). The analysis was conducted while flowing an O2/Ar mixture (50mLmin−1, 20vol.% O2) from room temperature to 1000K at a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. The fragments m/z =18 (H2O) and 44 (CO2) were continuously monitored with the mass spectrometer. Gas lines from the reactor outlet to the MS inlet were heated to 393K to avoid H2O condensation phenomena. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were also performed with the U-shaped reactor connected to the mass spectrometer. A H2/Ar mixture (5vol.% H2/Ar) was contacted with the sample while heating from room temperature to 1000K at a rate of 5Kmin−1. N2O titration was employed to evaluate the amount of metallic copper species exposed on the surface of the catalyst, according to Chinchen et al. [38]. N2O measurements were carried out by placing 0.050g of the catalyst precursor in a U-tube reactor where it was first reduced in situ from RT to 573K with a H2/Ar (5% v/v) flow of 50mLmin−1 and a rate of 5K⋅min−1. The catalyst was purged with a N2 flow (50mLmin−1) at the reduction temperature for 15min and cooled down to 333K to remove the physisorbed H2. Later, the catalysts were partially oxidized at 333K with a N2O/N2 (0.1% v/v) flow of 50mLmin−1. Chemisorbed N2O was monitored in a Balzer PrismaTM quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS 200) using Ar (0.1% v/v) as the reference. The delay in the registration of the N2O signal is attributed to the decomposition of the N2O on the surface of the metallic copper species located on the surface of the catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectra were performed using a Physical Electronics PHI 5700 spectrometer with non-monochromatic Al Kα radiation (300W, 15kV, 1486.6eV) with a multi-channel detector. Spectra of samples were recorded in the constant pass energy mode at 29.35eV, using a 720μm diameter analysis area. Charge referencing was measured against adventitious carbon (C 1s at 284.8eV). A PHI ACCESS ESCA-V6.0 F software package was used for acquisition and data analysis. A Shirley-type background was subtracted from the signals. All recorded spectra were always fitted using Gaussian–Lorentzian curves to more accurately determine the binding energy of the different element core levels. Both fresh and spent catalysts were stored in sealed vials with an inert solvent. The sample preparation was conducted in a dry box under N2 flow, where the solvent was evaporated prior to its introduction into the analysis chamber, and directly analysed without previous treatment. Fresh and used solid catalysts were analysed by TXRF, performed on a Seifert EXTRA-II spectrometer (Rich Seifert & Co., Ahrensburg, Germany) equipped with two X-ray fine focus lines, Mo and W anodes, and a Si (Li) detector with an active area of 80mm2 and a resolution of 157eV at 5.9keV (Mn Kα). The sample (10mg) was ground to a powder of particle sizes less than 30μm in an agate mortar. Then, 2mL of high-purity water was added, and the sample was homogenized for 10min by ultrasonic treatment to disperse the possible agglomerated particles. Two microlitres of the suspension was placed on a flat plastic carrier, and the water was evaporated off under vacuum. The textural parameters were evaluated from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K, as determined by an automatic ASAP 2020 system from Micromeritics. Prior to nitrogen adsorption, samples were evacuated overnight at 423K. Pore volume and pore size distribution were determined with the BJH method."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The vapour-phase hydrogenation of furfural was performed in a tubular quartz reactor with a diameter of 6.35mm (¼″) by putting the pelletized catalyst (325–400μm) at the centre of the reactor tube between two layers of glass beads and quartz wool and controlled by a thermocouple in direct contact with the catalyst bed. Mass transfer limitations could be excluded because smaller particle sizes gave similar catalytic results. Prior to the catalytic test, catalysts were reduced in situ under a H2 flow (60mLmin−1, Air Liquide, 99.99%) for 1h at 573K. After reduction, the catalysts were cooled down to the selected reaction temperature under H2 flow (10mLmin−1). When this temperature was reached, a flow of 3.87mLh−1 of a furfural (Sigma–Aldrich) solution in cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) (Sigma–Aldrich) (5vol.%) was continuously injected using a HPLC pump. CPME is an environmentally friendly solvent that has been used in different organic reactions, thus is a green co-solvent for the selective dehydration of lignocellulosic pentose to furfural [39]. The reaction products were analysed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector and a CP-Wax 52 CB capillary column. The furfural conversion and selectivity were calculated and are defined as follows: Conversion ( % ) = mol of furfural converted mol of furfural fed × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = mol of the product mol of furfural converted × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The Cu/Zn atomic ratios determined by TXRF analysis in the precursor materials are similar to the theoretical ones, thus confirming that co-precipitation is a suitable method for the synthesis of metal oxide mixtures with the desired metal composition (Table 1 ). The diffractograms of the samples, before calcination, without or with low and moderate copper contents, ZnO, CuZnO-0.2, CuZnO-0.4 and CuZnO-1.0, show the existence of zinc-based phases, such as hydrozincite (Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6, ICDD 72-1100) and hydrated zinc hydroxycarbonate (Zn4(CO3)(OH)6·H2O, ICDD 03-0787) (Fig. S1, Supplementary Information). In the CuZnO-x samples with Cu:Zn molar ratios between 0.2 and 2.5, aurichalcite (Cu2Zn3(CO3)2(OH)6, ICDD 09-0492) and hydrozincite partially replaced with copper ((Cu,Zn)5(CO3)2(OH)5, ICDD 38-0152) are also observed. However, for the CuZnO-2.5 sample, as well as for CuZnO-6.0 and Cu, reflections of copper carbonate are identified. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of CuZnO-2.5 are less intense and broader than those of the rest of the precursors suggesting a low crystallinity, probably due to a smaller crystal size. After calcination at 673K for 1h, solids with low copper contents (CuZnO-0.2 and CuZnO-0.4) exhibit diffraction peaks at 2θ =31.8°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.6°, 56.7° and 63.0°, which can be assigned to an unique crystalline phase, i.e., hexagonal zinc oxide (1, ICDD 36-1451) (Fig.1 A). When the copper content is increased, diffractograms also reveal the presence of signals at 32.6°, 35.7°, 38.9°, 48.8°, 53.6°, 58.2° and 61.6°, associated with CuO (2, ICDD 80-0076), and these are the only diffraction peaks detected in the CuZnO-6.0 sample with the highest copper content (68.2wt% of copper). The reducibility of precursors was evaluated by H2-TPR to elucidate the required temperature to obtain a complete reduction of the copper species. Fig. 2 exhibits the TPR profiles of the CuZnO-x precursors, where H2 consumption (m/z =2) and evolved H2O (m/z =18) were monitored. The peaks are associated uniquely with the reduction of copper species because ZnO reduction takes place at a very high temperature, i.e., 1200K [40]. Pure CuO shows peaks centred at approximately 490K corresponding to H2 consumption and evolved water. In the case of CuZnO-x catalysts, all peaks are shifted to lower temperatures when the copper content is decreased, which suggests that the presence of Zn species favours the reducibility of Cu species, pointing out a close contact between Cu and Zn oxides, according to data reported in the literature [41]. Considering the H2-TPR data, a temperature of 573K was selected for the reduction of precursors to obtain the corresponding catalysts. The diffractograms of reduced CuZnO-x materials (Fig.1B) exhibit diffraction peaks associated with metallic copper (3, JCPDS 85-1326), giving reflections at 2θ =43.3° and 50.4°. The intensity of these signals increased with the copper content as expected; in fact, these diffraction peaks are difficult to discern for the catalyst with the lowest copper content (CuZnO-0.2). Considering that the X-ray signal broadening can simultaneously be attributed to strain and size effects, the Williamson–Hall equation [37], where these two effects are separated, was applied to the main copper reflection (2θ =43.3°). Thus, this (111) crystallographic plane was used to calculate the average metallic copper crystal size (Table 1). The Cu0 particle size increases for the CuZnO-x catalysts with copper content (6.4–43.2nm), but these values are always lower than the corresponding pure metallic copper (69.0nm), prepared by following the same precipitation method. These particle sizes were smaller than those reported by Nagaraja et al. for Cu/MgO catalysts synthesized using the co-precipitation method [9], in which the Cu particle sizes varied between 22 and 120nm for Cu loadings ranging between 10 and 80wt%. Therefore, it can be inferred that the presence of amphoteric ZnO, in close contact with Cu species, favours the formation of smaller Cu0 crystallites, despite the higher reduction temperature used in the present work (573K instead of 523K) [41]. On the other hand, ZnO reflections (2, JCPDS 79-2205) are also present in the CuZnO-x catalysts and are more intense for the materials with less copper content. Signals corresponding to the CuO phase were not detected, which indicates the full reduction of the copper species. The XPS technique gives insights into the oxidation state of copper species on the surface of the catalysts from its characteristic binding energies and modified Auger parameters (α). The Cu 2p photoelectron spectra of CuZnO-x catalysts are shown in Fig.3 A. The presence of Cu2+ is associated with a peak centred at 934.0eV, but the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the reduced catalysts only show a peak at 932.0eV. This observation, together with the absence of a typical shake-up satellite at 940–945eV for the Cu2+ species related to the unoccupied 3d states, shows the existence of reduced copper species in the form of Cu0 and/or Cu+ [42,43]. However, the distinction between Cu0 and Cu+ is not straightforward on the basis of the photoelectronic peak alone. Thus, the Auger CuLMM signal can be used to distinguish between Cu0 and Cu+ species [44,45]. The broad peak with a maximum kinetic energy at 919.0eV indicates the presence of Cu0. In addition, it can be noticed that the presence of a small shoulder at approximately 916eV indicates the presence of a small proportion of Cu+ species in the CuZnO-2.5 and CuZnO-6.0 catalysts, possibly due to a partial reduction of copper(II) species (Fig. 4 ) [46]. The BE values of the Cu 2p3/2, O 1s and Zn 2p3/2 core levels for the CuZnO-x catalysts are compiled in Table 1. The two signals obtained for O 1s, at approximately 530.0 and 532.0eV correspond to the lattice O2− ion and hydroxyl or carbonate species, respectively, and the peak at approximately 1021.5eV is associated with Zn2+ species [47]. The surface Cu/Zn atomic ratios obtained from XPS increase, as expected, with copper content, although these are significantly lower than the corresponding bulk values, especially for catalysts with higher copper contents. This trend corroborates the observed increase of the copper particle sizes deduced from XRD. It must be taken into account that the XPS technique only gives information about the first atomic layers (2–3nm) of the studied materials. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K of reduced CuZnO-x catalysts are of type IV according to the IUPAC classification, which indicates the presence of a mesoporous structure. Moreover, the H3 type of hysteresis loops demonstrates the existence of slit pores originating from layered aggregates. BET surface area values increase with copper content, reaching a value of 71.6m2 g−1 for the CuZnO-1.0 catalyst (Table 2 ). However, the surface area decreases to 46.6 and 38.8m2 g−1 for CuZnO-2.5 and CuZnO-6.0 catalysts, respectively. Table 2 also shows the values of average pore diameter and pore volume, which vary between 30–40nm and 0.13–0.44cm3 g−1, respectively, for the CuZnO-x catalysts. The determination of Cu0 exposed on the catalyst surface was carried out using N2O chemisorption. The data compiled in Table 2 reveal the low metallic surface for bulk copper, whereas values ranging between 13.6 and 18.6mCu 2 g−1 are obtained for the CuZnO-x catalysts, except for the catalyst with the highest copper content which showed the lowest value of 5.9m2 Cu g−1. These data are in agreement with those deduced by the application of the Williamson–Hall equation to the XRD data. It is found that low copper loadings lead to smaller and more reducible copper particles interacting with the ZnO matrix. The similar metal surface areas of CuZnO-0.2 and CuZnO-2.5 could be explained by considering the crystalline phases present in the samples before calcination (see above). These different features observed in the XRD patterns of the CuZn-0.2 and CuZnO-2.5 samples before calcination could justify the unusual evolution of the metal surface area as a function of the Cu:Zn molar ratio (Table 2). Nevertheless, it could be very useful to compare the effect of metal particle sizes, which are very different (6.4 and 23.6nm for CuZnO-0.2 and CuZnO-2.5, respectively) but maintain an analogous metal surface area, on the catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of furfural."
7,Catalytic study,"3.2 Catalytic study The family of CuZnO-x catalysts was evaluated in the gas phase hydrogenation of furfural (FUR) at atmospheric pressure by using a solution of FUR in cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), which displays favourable properties such as a low boiling point (379K), relative stability under acid and basic conditions, low formation of peroxides and low solubility in water in comparison with other ethereal solvents such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran [48]. First, the stability of CPME was tested under similar experimental conditions at 463K. The uniquely identified chemical after 5h of time-on-stream (TOS) was the solvent, and therefore the CPME solvent did not undergo any decomposition reactions under those reaction conditions. Hydrogenation of FUR can lead to different products, including furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 2-methylfuran (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 2-tetramethylfuran and other ring-opening products, depending on catalyst and experimental conditions [8]. Regarding the catalytic activities of the CuZnO-x catalysts, the unique products detected were FOL and MF. In any case, ring opening products were identified under such experimental conditions. Concerning the influence of different experimental variables, the reaction temperature was first varied in the range of 443–503K. The catalytic results for two different copper loadings (CuZnO-0.2 and CuZnO-2.5) demonstrated that both high FUR conversion and FOL yield values were attained for intermediate temperatures (463–483K). Moreover, a moderate deactivation is observed mainly at high reaction temperatures and for the highest copper content (Fig. 5 ). However, the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst maintains a FUR conversion higher than 90% with a FOL yield close to 80% at 463K after 5h of TOS. Therefore, the reaction temperature of 463K was selected to evaluate the influence of the rest of the experimental parameters on catalytic activity. The volcano shape of the variation of the activity with temperature was observed by Liu et al. using copper chromite as the catalyst [49]. These authors found the highest catalytic performance at 473K, and they explained the low reaction rate at higher temperatures by the polymerization of both furfural and furfuryl alcohol and their adsorption on the catalyst surface as carbonaceous deposits, thus covering a fraction of copper active sites. The reduction temperature was varied to assess its influence on the catalytic activity. Here, an optimum value of 573K is found because an incomplete reduction is observed at lower temperatures, whereas higher values lead to larger metal copper particles, resulting in a low available metal surface and leading to a lower activity in FUR hydrogenation. After reduction at 623K, FUR conversion and FOL yield values are 70 and 52mol%, respectively, after 5h of TOS at 463K for the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst (Fig. S2, Supplementary Information). The study of FUR conversion as a function of time-on-stream (Fig. 6 ) reveals that an increase of the Cu:Zn molar ratio leads to worse catalytic activity; indeed, the deactivation was more pronounced. Thus, while the FUR conversion of the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst barely varies within 5h of TOS maintaining a value higher than 90mol%, catalysts with higher copper contents achieve conversion values lower than 60mol% after 5h of TOS. This behaviour can be correlated with the smallest metal particle sizes obtained for low copper loadings (Table 2), leading to higher metal surface areas. It can be argued that metallic copper is stabilized in catalysts with a high proportion of ZnO because the average metal particle size observed in the used catalysts (for Cu:Zn molar ratios between 0.2 and 1.0) is very close to that of the fresh catalysts. These catalysts also possess metal surface areas between 13.6 and 18.0m2 g−1. However, the CuZnO-2.5 catalyst with an even larger metal surface area (18.6m2 g−1) than that of the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst, in which the initial FUR conversion can be extrapolated to 100%, suffers a stronger deactivation. This could be attributed to the sintering of metal particles, similar to the catalyst with the highest copper loading (CuZnO-6.0) and pure copper, because the average sizes of metal crystallites are higher than 50nm. In all cases, hydrogenation products were mainly FOL and also MF, reaching a FOL yield close to 80% after 5h TOS for the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst. This catalyst maintains its catalytic activity even after 24h of TOS (Fig. 7 ). This graph reveals how the catalyst suffers a progressive deactivation during the catalytic test, which can be attributed to the loss of active centres related to the formation of MF, while the active sites related to the formation of FOL are more stable and barely suffer deactivation, obtaining approximately 0.0015mol of FOL h−1 g−1 along the TOS. This kinetic study demonstrates the stability of the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst, in contrast with the strong deactivation of copper chromite previously reported in the literature [49]. This drawback, together with the presence of chromium in its composition, has prompted the search for other catalytic systems. To confirm the existence of metal sites with different hydrogenating capacities responsible for the formation of FOL and MF, a feed composed of FOL in CPME was fed (Fig. 8 ). The results reveal that a conversion of 35mol% is attained after 1h of TOS with full selectivity towards MF, but in 5h the activity decays until complete deactivation of the catalyst. This finding reveals that the hydrogenating capacity of sites from FOL to MF, initially selective towards the formation of MF, is somehow completely reduced. Thus, the selectivity towards FOL is favoured with time-on-stream due to these sites, which are responsible for FOL selectivity and are more stable by their lower hydrogenating capacities. Therefore, it seems that furfural is first converted into FOL at both high and low hydrogenating capacity sites, and then subsequent deoxygenation leads to MF on such highly active sites, which are rapidly deactivated and therefore leaving only the mild hydrogenating sites to conduct the reaction. This reaction pathway was previously proposed by Sitthisa et al. [30] (Scheme 1 ). On the other hand, Nagaraja et al. already reported the advantage of the coprecipitation method in preparing Cu/MgO catalysts, which gave rise to high dispersion of copper species favoured by the interaction with oxygen vacancies of MgO [26]. A similar mechanism for stabilizing copper species in the ZnO support can be proposed to explain the excellent dispersion attained. Different Cr-free copper based catalysts have been reported as promising metal catalysts for furfural hydrogenation to FOL [9,12,50,51]. Concerning the active phase of the copper catalysts in FUR hydrogenation, Nagaraja et al. have noted that the selective formation of FOL is related to the existence of Cu0 [51], although a simple bimolecular surface reaction with a rate-determining step involving both Cu+ and Cu0 species has also been proposed for optimum performance [9,52]. DFT calculations have demonstrated a strong repulsion between the surface Cu (111) and the furan ring by overlapping the 3d band of Cu atoms and the anti-bonding orbital of the aromatic furan ring, which facilitates the preferential interaction with the carbonyl group, rather than the furanic ring [30,53]. From XPS results (Fig.4B), the coexistence of both types of copper sites, i.e., Cu+ (45–61%) and Cu0 (39–55%), can be inferred, although no trend is observed which could be correlated with the catalytic performance. In any case, this confirms the formation of Cu+ species during the catalytic process, although these species are not detected by XRD, suggesting that this process takes place only on the surface of the catalyst. The deactivation process observed in different copper-based catalytic systems used in FUR hydrogenation has been explained by the coverage of copper active sites by coke or adsorbed reactants/products, which can be inferred from the high carbon percentages found in the spent catalysts, or copper metal particle sintering or loss of the active Cu+ species by reduction. In the present work, the carbon content of spent catalysts, as determined by CHN analysis, is lower than 1.5wt% in all cases. However, XPS study reveals carbon percentages as high as 30–40wt% on the surface of spent catalysts, indicating that the most accessible metal sites are covered by carbonaceous deposits during the course of the hydrogenation process, which could explain the slight deactivation observed in this family of CuZnO-x catalysts. Their high catalytic activity could favour the formation of high carbon contents on the catalyst surface, as inferred from XPS spectra, although higher percentages were detected for copper supported on mesoporous SBA-15 silica catalysts (6.3wt%) evaluated under similar experimental conditions [32]. Thus, catalyst deactivation can be partially attributed to the carbonaceous deposits. However, XRD diffraction studies of spent catalysts have revealed that sintering of copper particles takes place in higher copper loading catalysts. A similar evolution of the catalytic activity as a function of the Cu loading in the FUR hydrogenation reaction has been observed by using Cu–MgO catalysts [9]. The strong deactivation observed in the case of copper chromite has been mainly attributed to the coverage of copper sites by CuCrO2 formed from Cr2O3 and Cu [49], besides the existence of carbonaceous deposits. In the present work, the presence of carbonaceous deposits and the increase of copper particle sizes (lower metal surface) give rise to a decrease of the amount of copper active sites for the adsorption of FUR, thus making a thorough kinetic study of FUR hydrogenation very difficult [52]. The plot of FOL selectivity versus FUR conversion (Fig. S3) reveals that the selectivity is relatively unaffected by the variation of conversion associated with different contact times, except for the CuZnO-0.2 catalyst after 1h of TOS for a contact time of 1.9s, where a high percentage of MF is obtained. Nevertheless, the selectivity value follows a similar trend after 5h of TOS, thus confirming the loss of the hydrogenating capacity of active sites responsible for the formation of MF. Therefore, CuZnO-x catalysts are active in FUR hydrogenation, and stability and selectivity towards the formation of FOL are favoured for catalysts with small copper metal particles and higher metal surface areas. The strong interaction of copper particles with the amphoteric ZnO protects the particles from sintering, which is a cause of deactivation in many metal catalysts. Thereby, it can be concluded that the deactivation process is attributed to the formation of carbonaceous deposits together with the sintering of copper species, depending on the copper metal loading."
8,Conclusions,"Catalysts with different Cu:Zn metal ratios ranging from 0.2 to 6.0 and prepared by coprecipitation have been evaluated in the gas-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All catalysts exhibit high stability with furfural conversion values higher than 55mol% after 5h of time-on-stream at 463K. The best catalytic performance is found for the catalyst with the lowest copper loading, which maintains a conversion higher than 60mol% after 24h of TOS and selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol close to 98mol%. The strong metal-support interaction explains the higher stability, whereas copper sintering has been observed for catalysts with high copper loading. The feeding of FOL instead of FUR has proved the existence of two types of hydrogenation sites; those favouring the formation of MF are quickly deactivated by carbonaceous deposits, thus improving the FOL yield. Concerning the nature of active sites, the existence of Cu+ and Cu0 in spent catalysts, as demonstrated by XPS, would indicate their participation in the catalytic process."
