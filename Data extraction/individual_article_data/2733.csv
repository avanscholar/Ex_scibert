0,Introduction,"The world’s declining fossil fuel reserves require the development of alternative clean and renewable resources of energy, and the production of photobiological hydrogen is considered to be promising in this respect [1,2]. Hydrogen has several desirable characteristics. It is a high-energy carrier, does not pollute, and yields only water after combustion. These characteristics make hydrogen a suitable fuel for the future [3–5]. A selected group of photosynthetic organisms has evolved the ability to harness light energy to drive H2 gas production from water. Among these, the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under anaerobic conditions is capable of H2 photoproduction [1,6]. The process is sustained by both the photosystem II (PSII)-driven water splitting, and the fermentation of stored carbohydrates which provide H+ and e− to hydrogenase (H2ase), the synthesis and functioning of which is very sensitive to the presence of oxygen [7,8]. Anaerobiosis is attained by down-regulating the activity of PSII by means of sulfur starvation, until the rate of photosynthesis crosses that of respiration [6]. In order to optimize the bio-hydrogen production process in C. reinhardtii, different strategies have been suggested, such as an optimization of the light, pH regime, medium composition [9–12] and addition of sulphate to the medium during hydrogen production [13–15]. Moreover, the utilization of mutant strains with reduced light harvesting antenna complexes and an increased electron and proton supply have been studied [16,17]. It has been reported a relevant increase in the rate and duration of hydrogen production under sulfur starvation in a C. reinhardtii mutant capable of a high starch accumulation and blocked in state 1 condition [17]. Recently, a consistent increase in hydrogen production was obtained with D1 protein C. reinhardtii mutants [18,19]. The possibility of improving the biomass and output rates of hydrogen production has been reported in C. reinhardtii, by introducing an alternative route to supply H+ and e− to the hydrogenase enzyme utilizing an alternative source [20]. In particular, the authors reported an increased H2 production in a C. reinhardtii mutant by facilitating access to glucose. It has also been reported that C. reinhardtii cells were capable of accumulating large amounts of starch following nitrogen starvation, particularly when they were grown under mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions [21]. The versatility in utilizing organic substrates as a carbon source makes C. reinhardtii and other microalgae suitable for testing their growth in wastewater which are usually characterized by high organic matter content [22]. Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is the by-product of the production of olive oil. It has a dark brownish color and a strong odor, and is considered to be one of the most greatly pollutant agricultural wastes. The fresh organic matter content in OMW causes agricultural and environmental concerns in olive oil-producing countries because of its effects on soil microflora, status and fertility and groundwater contamination [23]. The toxicity of OMW is also due to its high content of phenolic compounds in a wide range of molecular weights (MW), from low-MW substituted phenols to complex high-MW phenolic compounds [24–27]. During the production of olive oil, large quantities of phenols are released along with the wastewater, depending on their partition coefficient. Previous studies have reported the utilization of olive mill wastewaters for the growth of the microalgae [28–31], and for photobiological hydrogen production [32] since these wastewaters are enriched with large amounts of organic constituents, such as sugars, volatile acids, polyalcohols and fats. We have devised and patented a new system of OMW depuration, which consists of the biofiltration of crude OMW using two vegetable matrices, the first one of which is made with the biomass of the Azolla caroliniana fern and the other one, with activated carbon (Patent n. FI2006A000155). By using this system, it is possible to remove almost totally the phenolic compounds thus obtaining clean water which still contains the main short-chain organic acids and monosaccharide sugars that can sustain the growth of microalgae. In this paper we have investigated the possibility of utilizing diluted pretreated OMW as a substrate for growing C. reinhardtii. Cell-grown in OMW has been found to be rich in carbohydrate content, which constituted a source for hydrogen production under conditions of sulfur starvation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Pretreatment of olive mill wastewaters,"2.1 Pretreatment of olive mill wastewaters The OMW was centrifuged and subjected to filtrations using two differently packed vegetable matrices (A. caroliniana and granular activated carbon), which removed most of the pollutant substances, particularly polyphenols, by means of absorption [33]. The chemical composition of OMW before and after the treatment is shown in Table 1 . In order to standardize the composition of the OMW used in the experiments, the treated OMW was diluted to a concentration of organic compound (COD) of 5000mgkg−1. For this purpose, the treated OMW was usually diluted by about 50%. Furthermore, such a dilution ratio made it possible to further reduce both the color of the wastewater, and the initial COD between 11.000 and 12000."
3,Olive mill wastewater analysis,"2.2 Olive mill wastewater analysis Table 2 shows the chemical composition of the treated OMW used in this study. The treated OMW showed the presence of a considerable amount of sugars, such as glucose and fructose, which were detected at concentrations of 340mgl−1 and 130mgl−1, respectively. Among the organic acids, citric, acetic and malic acids were predominant. In addition, appreciable amounts of lactic acid and succinic acid could also be detected. Among the alcoholic compounds, mannitol was the most abundant. The total nitrogen was very low 7.01mgl−1, while phosphorus contents reached 42.94mgl−1. The presence of polyphenol was reduced to 10.41mgl−1. Among heavy metals the highest value was found for Ni (65.81μgl−1), while the amounts of Pb, Cr, Hg, and Cu, was in the order of few μgl−1. However, OMW was characterized by a high concentration of COD, in particular sugars (glucose and fructose) and acetic acid, which could be used profitably for the photomixotrophic growth of Chlamydomonas."
4,Strain and culture conditions,"2.3 Strain and culture conditions The CC124 strain, which was kindly provided by Dr. Seibert of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Golden, Colorado, USA), was used in this study. The C. reinhardtii CC124cells were grown axenically in a complete tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium [34], and were then transferred to 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The cells were subsequently acclimated for 3 weeks in a thermostat (28°C, 70μmol photonsm−2 s−1) in different culture media that consisted of a mixture of different volume fractions of TAP and OMW, namely: (1) TAP (0%) -treated OMW (100%); (2) TAP (25%) -treated OMW (75%), and (3) TAP (50%) -treated OMW (50%). The pH of the culture media was adjusted to 7.2. The dilution of pretreated OMW with TAP was effected in order to increase the nitrogen level so as to attain a sufficient biomass growth to be used for the hydrogen production experiments. Fresh inoculum of cells growing in different media were maintained by diluting the cultures twice a week with their respective culture medium. Cultures were then grown in 0.5l glass columns, (5-cm i.d), at a temperature of 28°C and at a light intensity of 70μmol photonsm−2 s−1, supplied on both sides. Culture mixing was provided by bubbling a mixture of air enriched with CO2 (3% volume fraction). Control cultures of CC124 C. reinhardtii strain were grown photomixotrophically in a TAP medium, under the conditions previously described. In order to test the effect of the TAP dilution of the nutrients on biomass composition and growth of C. reinhardtii cells, an additional trial using TAP 50% diluted with distillated water was performed."
5,Hydrogen production,"2.4 Hydrogen production For the H2 production experiments, cells in the exponential phase grown were harvested by means of centrifugation, washed 5 times with a sulfur-depleted medium, and re-suspended in a sulfur-depleted medium (TAP-S) at a chlorophyll concentration of 12mgl−1. The sulfur-depleted cultures were placed in a flat glass photobioreactor (PBR) (5cm light path, 1100ml culture volume) described elsewhere [35]. The algal cells were exposed to a light intensity of 70μmol photonsm−2 s−1, supplied on both sides of the reactor (Daylight, Dulux L, Osram). Experiments were carried out at 28°C. The main port at the top of the PBR (2.5cm i.d.) was sealed with a stopper equipped with tygon tubes that connected the PBR headspace to the gas-to-liquid conversion bottle. The stopper was also fitted with a three-way valve to permit culture-cell sampling. Hydrogen produced by the cultures was measured using a system consisting of five elements: a PBR equipped with four probes for the continuous monitoring of cultures parameters: temperature, pH, redox potential (a platinum/gold electrode), dissolved oxygen concentration O2 (pO2) (Hamilton Oxysense, Bonaduz, Switzerland), a gas-to-liquid conversion bottle, a liquid accumulation bottle, a digital balance a lap-top computer for continuous data recording. The digital balance, monitoring the changes in the weight of the liquid accumulating bottle (Acculab, ALC models, Sartorius Group, Goettingen, Germany), was connected to the lap-top computer via a RS232 to RS485/422 converter (Intelligent DA&C module ND 6520 UDAM, Chemitec, Florence, Italy). A software for automatic culture control and data acquisition was developed by Chemitec (Florence, Italy). Raw data recorded during the experiments were then processed using a Linuxbased software written by us. Data of O2 and H2 gas measurements were stored at 1-min intervals, and represented the average of values recorded during a 3-s interval. Biogas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph (model Clarus 500, Perkin Elmer), using a packed column (model Carbosieve SII Spherical Carbon, Supelco)."
6,Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements,"2.5 Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements In order to evaluate the performance of the cultures during the hydrogen production experiments, in situ chlorophyll fluorescence was carried out using a portable PAM-2100 fluorometer (H. Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The optical fiber of the fluorometer was pointed directly onto the lateral face of the PBR, that is, perpendicularly to the main direction of the light."
7,Analytical procedures,"2.6 Analytical procedures Chlorophyll (Chl a-b) was determined spectrophotometrically in 90% acetone [36]. The dry weight was determined on duplicate samples by filtering 10-ml culture through pre-weighted glass fiber membranes, and then drying it at 105°C for 3-hours. Carbohydrate and protein contents were recorded on 5ml culture samples aseptically taken from the PBR at both the beginning and end of the hydrogen production phase. The total carbohydrate content was determined using the phenol-sulfuric acid method according to [37], using D+ glucose as a standard. The total protein content was evaluated as N ×6.25. The elemental analysis was performed using a CHNSO Analyzer, Flash EA, 1112 Series, Thermo Electron Corporation. The HPLC analysis of treated OMWW for a determination of the organic compounds was performed using a C18 analytical column, 250mm×4.6mm (I.D), (Beckman ODS). The column temperature was 25°C. The mobile phase was a solution of water+0.1% H3PO4, and the flow rate was 1.0mlmin−1. The analysis of the other OMW components were performed as reported in [38]. The concentrations of individual carotenoids were assessed using a reversed-phase Beckman System Gold HPLC (module 125 solvent) equipped with a diode array detector, model 168 Nouveau, according to Gilmore and Yamamoto [39]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Growth of C. reinhardtii on TAP medium and TAP–OMW mixture,"3.1 Growth of C. reinhardtii on TAP medium and TAP–OMW mixture Growing cells on treated OMW without any dilution with TAP did not result in a satisfactory growth of C. reinhardtii, even after several days of cultivation, and this was due to the lack of a sufficient amount of nitrogen (see Table 1). Consequently, it was impossible to carry out hydrogen production experiments with these cultures. On the other hand, culture grown on a medium consisting of 75% OMW and diluted with 25% TAP resulted in a 80% lower biomass accumulation than that achieved with 100% TAP medium (results not shown). Hydrogen production experiments carried out with the biomass produced by these cultures yielded only 17.6ml H2 l−1, that is, 20% of what was recorded with full TAP. As these high ratios of dilution between OMW and TAP did not result in any positive improvement either in the growth of the culture or in the H2 production, no further investigations were made. The best ratio between TAP and OMW to be used to obtain a satisfactory growth of the cultures, as well as an increased hydrogen production as compared to the TAP cultures, was a 50% dilution ratio. With this ratio, the amount of nitrogen in the medium increased to 56.5mgl−1, mainly because of the contribution of the TAP. This dilution ratio was then used throughout the experiments. In Fig. 1 the growth is shown, in terms of both chlorophyll and dry weight increases, in cultures grown on TAP 50% diluted with OMW and on a standard TAP medium, which was used as a control (hereafter referred to as TAP–OMW cultures and TAP cultures, respectively). The TAP medium promoted a significantly higher chlorophyll accumulation, reaching 50mgl−1 at stationary phase, while cultures grown on a TAP–OMW medium reached a chlorophyll content that was 50% lower than the control value (Fig. 1a). The performance of the two cultures differed also when growth was evaluated through an increase in dry weight (Fig. 1b). In this case, however, the difference in the maximum dry weight reached by the cultures was found to be less relevant than the one observed in terms of chlorophyll. The chlorophyll-to-dry weight ratio remained almost constant in both the cultures during the exponential growth phase; it decreased strongly in the TAP–OMW cultures thereafter (Fig. 1c). Biochemical composition of the biomass grown on a TAP–OMW medium showed a higher carbohydrate content than the ones of the control (2-fold higher, expressed as percentage on the dry weight), while the protein content was lower than in the TAP cultures (Table 3 ). These findings were clearly reflected by a higher C/N ratio in the TAP–OMW cultures, resulting from a lower nitrogen content of the biomass. This fact evidenced that the metabolism of cells grown on TAP–OMW was substantially addressed to a synthesis of carbohydrates, rather than to cell multiplication, as occurred in TAP. It has been reported that mixotrophically grown Chlamydomonas cells under nitrogen starvation accumulated a much higher amount of starch compared to nutrient replete cultures [21]. Under nitrogen deprivation the cell growth is restricted and carbohydrates (starch) act as a sink to store reducing power produced by photosynthetic activity [40]. In our culture grown in a mixture of TAP–OMW, a nitrogen limitation may have occurred as the total concentration of this nutrient was about 50% lower than in TAP. In order to find out whether the lower growth rate and particularly the higher carbohydrate content attained with the cultures grown with the mixture of TAP–OMW, was due to the sole nitrogen limitation, we grew Chlamydomonas cells in a TAP medium 50% diluted with distilled water. As expected the biomass accumulation was lower (by 23%, not shown) than that attained with full TAP but the carbohydrate fraction did not increase much with respect to full strength TAP (Table 2). This experiment demonstrated that the mere limitation of nitrogen is not sufficient to significantly enhance the carbohydrate content in the biomass. To achieve this goal it is required to simultaneously increase the amount of organic fraction present in the medium as it was already shown by [21]. This condition was attained with 50% dilution of OMW with TAP medium. The chemical analysis of the medium composition, performed at the start and at the end of the exponential phase of growth of the cultures grown on TAP–OMW, enabled us to find out which compounds were utilized during cell growth, and may have a further insight into their influence on the composition of C. reinhardtii cells. For cells grown on TAP, the acetic acid, which is the sole source of organic compounds, was completely consumed within 1 day. Analysis of the composition of the TAP–OMW medium utilized for growing Chlamydomonas cells revealed an almost total consumption of the acetic acid. The citric acid, malic acid and mannitol decreased by 60–80mgl−1, while the succinic acid, lactic acid, glycerin and ethanol declined to a lesser extent (Table 4 ). Interestingly, a reduction in the amount of the glucose and fructose contents could be detected, with a decline by 80mgl−1 and 50mgl−1, respectively. Photoheterotrophic growth of C. reinhardtii is well documented on acetate, however, this microalga can also utilize pentose and hexose, as well as acetate, in the presence of light [21]. Organic carbon sources, such as succinate, 2-oxoglutarate and glucose, have been utilized for growing C. reinhardtii in studies on the influence of carbon sources on glutamate dehydrogenase activity for mixotrophic growth [41]. Doebbe et al. [20] were able to select a transformant of a Stm6 of C. reinhardtii cell line [17], which expressed the active Chlorella HUP1 (hexose uptake protein) hexose transporter. This mutant was able to grow heterotrophically on a medium supplemented with glucose. Under these conditions, the maximum growth rate reached was 0.04h−1. Interestingly, the growth rate reached by this mutant was similar to that achieved by C. reinhardtii cells grown in the dark in a medium supplemented with acetate (0.038h−1) [42]. Moreover, the authors reported a hydrogen production increased by 45–50% when glucose was added to the sulfur-deprived medium, because the cells were found to be enriched in carbohydrates, which were used as a substrate for the hydrogen production [20]. These results support our findings, that is, organic compounds present in the TAP–OMW, may have contributed to an increment in the biomass, and in particular to an increase in the accumulation of carbohydrates. However, with respect to heterotrophic conditions [42], the growth of C. reinhardtii attained under mixotrophic conditions in a medium made with a 50% volume mixture of pretreated OMW and TAP resulted in a significantly higher growth rate, which reached 0.0652h−1 and was only 25% lower than the one measured in TAP medium (0.0765h−1). Productivity of the cultures in the linear phase of growth were 33.2mgl−1 h−1 in TAP medium and 22.2mgl−1 h−1 TAP–OMW medium. The latter was somewhat lower than what was achieved with C. reinhardtii cultures grown on municipal wastewater generated in a sludge centrifuge, which had a higher nitrogen content [22]."
10,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production For the hydrogen production experiments with C. reinhardtii cultures grown on TAP and TAP–OMW medium, all the experiments were normalized for a Chl content of 12mgl−1. Since the TAP–OMW cultures showed a Chl/DW ratio lower than the TAP cultures, as a result a bit higher biomass amount was utilized for the hydrogen production process (342.4mgl−1), with respect to the control (307.7mgl−1). In C. reinhardtii cells grown on TAP, sulfur starvation induced the production of a H2 gas of about 100mll−1 (Fig. 2 , Table 5 ), while in the one grown on TAP–OMW, the hydrogen production was significantly higher, 150mll−1. In considering the hydrogen production on dry weight basis, it was interesting to observe that it was 37% higher in the TAP–OMW cultures compared to the TAP cultures. This result pointed out how the TAP–OMW culture biomass was more efficient in terms of H2 production. Indeed, the biomass content in the these cultures was only 11% higher than in the TAP cultures, and it was evident that the highest H2 production rate expressed as a percentage on dry weight was to be ascribed more to the higher carbohydrate content found in the cells grown on the mixture of TAP–OMW. This observation was further confirmed by the fact that cells grown on half strength TAP, which exhibited only a bit higher carbohydrate content than those grown in full TAP, showed a hydrogen output similar to that of the full TAP grown cells (99.3ml H2 l−1, not shown). Due to the effect of the sulfur starvation, a strong inhibition of the PSII activity was observed in all the cultures, and particularly in the one grown in TAP–OMW, as revealed by the decrease in the effective PSII quantum yield (Table 5). In correspondence of the establishing of anaerobic conditions and of the induction of the hydrogen production, a strong reduction in the effective PSII quantum yield was observed. The value of Δ F / F m ′ was found to be slightly lower (by 16%) in the TAP–OMW cultures. It was noted that the time needed to reach anaerobic conditions (aerobic phase) was shorter in the TAP–OMW cultures, indeed anaerobiosis in these cultures was established within 12h, while in the control cultures the anaerobic conditions took place after 21h of sulfur starvation (Table 5). The lag phase, i.e., the additional time needed for the induction of H2 production under anaerobiosis, was similar in both cultures (Table 5), consequently, the H2 production in the TAP–OMW cultures began earlier than in TAP cultures. The results related well to the presence, in these cultures, of a higher carbohydrate content, which represented a respiratory substrate that favored the elimination of O2 and promoted the faster transition to anaerobiosis [43]. Relevant differences could be observed in the length of the hydrogen production process. Indeed, this phase was found to be 21% longer in the TAP–OMW cultures than in the control ones (Table 5). The mean hydrogen production rate, as measured throughout the production time, was 25% higher in the TAP–OMW cultures than in the control cultures (Table 5). Fig. 3 shows the rates of hydrogen production over the process. It was interesting to observe that the TAP–OMW cultures exhibited the higher rate of production during all phases of the process. Differences could already be observed in the 10th–20th hour time intervals. In the TAP–OMW culture, the H2 production rate had already reached 0.70ml H2 h−1, while the process had not yet been induced in the control culture. During the following period under sulfur starvation, which corresponded to the 40th–80th hours, the differences further increased, with a H2 production rate that was 0.70–1.05ml H2 h−1 higher in the TAP–OMW culture than in the control ones. This high productivity was the result of both the faster induction of the process and the higher initial efficiency of the H2 production in TAP–OMW cultures, compared to the control ones, as revealed also by the higher initial slope of the curve of the H2 production (Fig. 2). Differences in the hydrogen production rates between the two cultures remained appreciable all over the process. After 100h of sulfur starvation, however, hydrogen production could be appreciated only in the TAP–OMW cultures (Fig. 3). The highest rates of hydrogen production were related to the highest total volume of biogas produced. These results were in accordance with previous findings, which had shown that the highest initial H2 production rates corresponded to the highest H2 output in photomixotrophic cultures, which accumulated a higher amount of starch during the aerobic phase, compared to photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic cultures [44]. It is well known that, under sulfur starvation, C. reinhardtii cells accumulate starch in the presence of acetate during the aerobic phase [45,46]. In our experiment, acetate was present in both cultures; however, the TAP–OMW cultures also had the highest amount of carbohydrates, which had been involved in the sustained hydrogen production by the endogenous catabolism of starch, thus contributing to the highest H2 output [47]. In monitoring the physiological, biophysical, and electrochemical parameters during the induction of hydrogen production in a sulfur-deprived medium, it was observed that C. reinhardtii cells were subjected to considerable changes in dissolved oxygen (pO2), redox potential (Eh), and pH (Fig. 4 ). In the TAP–OMW cultures, it could be observed that the dissolved oxygen concentration was already very low at the start of the sulfur starvation, whereas in the control ones an appreciable oxygen evolution could be detected during the aerobic phase (Fig. 4). These results well justify the earlier transition to anaerobiosis in the TAP–OMW cultures. In the TAP–OMW cultures, the redox potential was found to be very low at the beginning of the sulfur deprivation, due to the very low oxygen content, whereas in the full strength TAP cultures it remained at an almost constant value of 100mV during the aerobic phase. However, as soon as the dissolved oxygen concentration reached zero, the redox potential rapidly decreased, a behavior commonly observed in experiments of hydrogen production with CC124 grown in TAP [19,48]. During the process, in TAP culture, the redox potential remained at a less negative value, −300mV, during the exponential phase of the H2 production (30h), whereas in the TAP–OMW cultures it decreased to a more negative value, −400mV. It continued to decrease, down to a lower value of approximately −520mV, which was reached by both the cultures at the end of the production process (Fig. 4). Since the redox potential depends on the interplay between the rate of photosynthesis, chlororespiration, respiration rate, and H2 production [49], a possible explanation for the lower redox potential pattern observed in TAP–OMW cultures during the hydrogen production, could be the result of an enhanced contribution of carbohydrates to the indirect pathway for the H2 production, which maintained the level of PQ pool reduction higher. Measurements of the pH in the culture medium showed an increase in both TAP and TAP–OMW cultures prior to the establishment of anaerobiosis, due to the consumption of acetate (Fig. 4, insert). At the start of the H2 production, the pH was found to have increased from 7.30 to 7.83 in the TAP–OMW cultures, while instead it had increased from 7.2 to 8.2 in the full TAP. The consumption of acetate which occurred during the aerobic phase was higher in the TAP–OMW, which caused a higher increase in the pH level, thereafter the pH decreased in both the cultures as result of CO2 release by metabolism of carbohydrates. At the end of the H2 production process, the highest pH decrease was detected in the TAP–OMW cultures, where it reached a pH value of 6.8, whereas it decreased to a value of 7.3 in the full TAP cultures. The lower pH value recorded in the TAP–OMW cultures at the end of the H2 production process could be explained by the higher consumption of carbohydrates, which caused a greater release of CO2."
11,Changes in the biomass composition of C. reinhardtii under the sulfur starvation,"3.3 Changes in the biomass composition of C. reinhardtii under the sulfur starvation The total carbohydrate content in the TAP–OMW grown cultures, at the start of the sulfur starvation phase, was almost 2-fold higher than in the TAP grown cultures (Table 6 ). During the following aerobic phase, the carbohydrate content increased further by about 85% in the TAP cultures, and by 56% in TAP–OMW ones. However, in the latter cultures, at the end of aerobic phase the carbohydrate content was found to be 1.6-fold higher than in TAP cultures. During the following hydrogen production phase the amount of carbohydrates consumed by the TAP–OMW cultures was higher than in the TAP–ones. HPLC analysis performed on the sulfur-deprived medium of both the cultures, at the end of the hydrogen production phase, showed the absence of fermentation products such as ethanol and formate, and could indicate that carbohydrates consumed during the hydrogen production process were mainly utilized for hydrogen production. It is also worthwhile pointing out that a mass balance of the amounts of protein between the start and the end of sulfur starvation, performed in both cultures, showed that their consumption was comparable (101.59mgl−1 and 94.28mgl−1, in TAP and TAP–OMW cultures, respectively) (Table 6). This finding also supported the fact that the differences found in the hydrogen productions between the two cultures were mostly the result of their differences in the consumption of carbohydrates. Another indication of the different contributions of the carbohydrates to the hydrogen output between the two cultures came from the changes in the C/N ratio of the biomass at the start and at the end of the sulfur starvation. At the start, due to the different amount of carbohydrates stored in the biomass, the C/N ratio was significantly higher in the TAP–OMW culture (6.06), compared to that of the control (4.81) (Table 2), while at the end, because of a greater consumption of carbohydrates in the TAP–OMW cultures, the C/N ratios turned out to be comparable with each other (8.02 and 8.61 in TAP and TAP–OMW cultures, respectively) (Table 7 ). Basing their conclusions on the observation that starchless C. reinhardtii mutants sta6 and sta7 were greatly affected in their ability to produce hydrogen, Posewitz et al. [47] suggested that starch metabolism may play a central role in C. reinhardtii H2 production. In fact, two different pathways can supply reductants (i.e., reduced ferredoxin) to H2ase for the production of hydrogen in the light: a direct pathway through PSII, and an indirect PSII-independent pathway that relies on a non-photochemical reduction of the PQ pool [41,50]. It was hypothesised that starch catabolism plays a role in both pathways [50] by: (1) sustaining mitochondrial respiration and permitting the maintenance of anaerobic conditions for the PSII-dependent direct pathway, and (2) supplying electrons to the chlororespiratory pathway and to the hydrogenase through a PSI-dependent process along the indirect pathway [41,50,51]. Moreover, it has been proposed that the degradation of starch in C. reinhardtii is necessary to maintain hydrogenase transcription [47]. It is possible that that the degradation of starch affects intracellular levels of NAD(P)H and/or the oxidation state of the PQ pool, both of which have been demonstrated to regulate gene transcription either directly or through signal transduction [52,53]."
12,Changes in the xanthophyll-cycle pigments during the hydrogen process,"3.4 Changes in the xanthophyll-cycle pigments during the hydrogen process Changes in the xanthophyll-cycle pigments were also examined during the hydrogen production process. The xanthophyll cycle is considered to be a rapid stimulation mechanism, a response to an excess of energy that is activated within several minutes by low lumen pH. It represents a rapid defense strategy for protecting the PSII against the effects of excess light. This defense strategy consists of the formation of zeaxanthin through the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin via antheraxanthin when plants and algae are exposed to an excess of light [54–56]. During the hydrogen production process, we observed a strong induction of the xanthophylls-cycle pigments in both cultures (Table 8 ). In particular, a sizable amount of zeaxanthin, which was undetectable at the beginning of the sulfur starvation, was observed at the end of the hydrogen production process, particularly in the cultures previously grown in TAP–OMW. Indeed, the zeaxanthin content in the TAP–OMW cultures was 35% higher than that of the TAP ones, thus indicating a greater necessity for the photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus. This trend was also revealed by the 48% increase in the xanthophylls pool, which indicated a de novo synthesis of these photoprotective pigments, whereas the xanthophylls pool did not change significantly in the TAP cultures. The induction of the xanthophyll-cycle reflected the necessity for activating defensive strategies in response to sulfur starvation, due to an impairment in the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus, which is related to photoinhibition and to the degradation of the D1 protein [19,54,57]. We can suppose that the larger content of the zeaxanthin, and xanthophylls pool found in the TAP–OMW cells was necessary in order to make possible a prolonged photoprotection of PSII from photoinhibition. A considerable increase of the xanthophyll lutein was also observed in the cells of both cultures between the start and end of the sulfur starvation (Table 7). However, the presence of lutein was found to be higher in the TAP–OMW cells, both at the start and at the end of the sulfur starvation, which may indicate the necessity for an additional protection of the PSII in TAP–OMW cultures during the H2 production process. An enhanced lutein synthesis has been reported in the Chlorella protothecoides and Nannochloropsis gaditana microalgae in conditions of nitrogen limitation [58,59]. In particular, it is well known that the nitrogen metabolism in the algal cells decreases in conditions of nitrogen limitation, and that the synthesis of carotenoids and other non-nitrogen compounds increases due to the necessity for photoprotection. The TAP–OMW used in this study contained a limiting amount of nitrogen (total nitrogen value of 56.5mgl−1), and had a high C/N ratio (about 20), due to the presence of organic matter. This, too, was in accordance with the lesser chlorophyll accumulation and with the higher carbohydrate content in the cultures grown on the TAP–OMW medium."
13,Conclusions,"The cultivation of C. reinhardtii cells in a mixture of treated OMW and TAP (50% dilution) caused considerable changes in both the growth rate and the biochemical composition of the biomass. Because of the nitrogen limitation and the high organic compounds content, the growth of cells on OMW–TAP was mainly directed towards carbohydrate synthesis. A large amount of carbohydrates in the cells is desirable, since they contribute both to hydrogen production and to reach anaerobiosis in the culture faster. The cells grown on the TAP–OMW medium exhibited better hydrogen production performance, compared to the TAP grown cultures, in terms of both the total volume and the production rate. In addition, growth on mixtures of TAP–OMW induced the synthesis of an amount of lutein that was greater than in the TAP medium, making these treated-OMW a promising source also for the production of high value biomass. Olive mill wastes are produced by the olive oil production industry particularly in Mediterranean countries, where it is a very important economic activity that has led to widespread concern for the environment. There is, as yet, no accepted treatment method for all the wastes generated during the production of oil [24]. This lack is mainly due to technical and economical limitations, but also to the scattered nature of olive mills throughout the Mediterranean basin. Furthermore, the production of olive oil is expanding worldwide, and this will lead to even larger amounts of olive mill waste unless new treatment and utilization technologies are introduced. Our findings open up another of the possible prospects for an exploitation of the use of OMW for the production of hydrogen and biomass using the microalga C. reinhardtii."
