0,Introduction,"Value aggregation to the glycerol generated in large surplus by the Biodiesel industry can contribute to a more economically viable production (Nda-Umar et al., 2019; Beatrice et al., 2013; Monteiro et al., 2018). Glycerol is a highly functionalized platform molecule, which has been converted to different chemicals of industrial interest, such as 1,2 or 1,3-propanediol, acrolein, polyglycerol, dihydroxyacetone, among others (Liu et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2017; Anitha et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016). Glycerol carbonate and solketal are also examples of glycerol-derivatives useful as potential fuel bio-additives, motivating the development of several production processes (Appaturi et al., 2020; da Silva et al., 2015). Triacetin is another bioadditive useful that enhances the properties of the fossil fuels and can be itself used as biofuel (da Silva et al., 2016; Mota et al., 2010). Etherification of glycerol has been performed with alcohols (i.e., tert-butyl alcohol, TBA) or olefins (i.e., isobutylene) as alkylating agents (Srinivas et al., 2016; Celdeira et al., 2014; González et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014). Although in the synthesis routes with isobutylene, the products can be easily separated from reaction medium, it has a fossil origin and undergoes oligomerization during the process, resulting in a high substrate consumption and problems to be formulated with fuels (Cannilla et al., 2014). This process has still problems such as mass transfer limitation, low solubility in glycerol feed; besides that, it generally requires greater pressures and high temperatures (Liu et al., 2013; Bozkurt et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016). Conversely, TBA can be obtained from renewable sources (i.e., such as starch and lignocellulose), or from propylene oxide (Frusteri et al., 2009). However, due to the formation of an azeotropic mixture, the separation of the products is more complicated than that performed with isobutylene. This obstacle can be overcome by using a membrane reactor, which involves more complicated conditions. Nonetheless, the etherification of glycerol with TBA can be carried out at a lower or autogenous pressure, reducing the costs of the process. Since this route avoids the usage of organic solvents, benefits the mass transfer, helps to solubilize the glycerol, improves the ethers yield, and is performed at milder reaction conditions, it can be considered as the most sustainable approach to manufacture glycerol ethers (Manjunathan et al., 2016; Estevez et al., 2016). The reaction selectivity gives frequently mono-(i.e., MTBG), di-(i.e., DTBG), and tri-(i.e., TTBG) tert-butyl glycerol ethers as main products (Di Serio et al., 2010). While MTBG has been used as a surfactant, the most functionalized products h-GTBE (i.e., DTBG and TTBG) are potentially blendable bioadditives to the liquid fuels, replacing the traditional oxygenate additives such as MTBE (i.e., methyl tert-butyl ether) (Vlad et al., 2012). Particularly, h-GTBE bioadditives increase the cetane number, reduce the emission of particulate matter and the emission of greenhouse effect gases (Huang and Kim, 2015). Several metal catalysts have been used in etherification reactions of glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol: zeolites (Gonzalez et al., 2013; Veiga et al., 2017), sulfonic acid ion exchange resins (Pico et al., 2013), sulfonated niobia and pillared clay (Celdeira et al., 2014), sulfonic acid functionalized mesoporous polymers (Manjunathan et al., 2016), sulfonated hybrid silicas (Estevez et al., 2016), amorphous organosilica-aluminum phosphates (Estevez et al., 2017) are only some examples. In addition, several solid supported catalysts have also been used in these reactions (Cannilla et al., 2014; Sutter et al., 2015; Beatrice et al., 2013). Notwithstanding, the main challenge to be overcome by the solid-supported catalysts is resisting the leaching and the deactivation triggered by the highly polar reaction medium. Keggin heteropolyacids (HPAs) are metal oxygen clusters that have arisen as an attractive option to the solid-supported catalysts (Da Silva and Liberto, 2016). Although heteropolyacids are soluble in polar solvents, they can be supported on solid matrixes or converted to insoluble solid salts by the straightforward exchange of their protons by cations with large radium (da Silva and de Oliveira, 2018; Chopda and Dave, 2020; Voicu et al., 2012). For these reasons, HPAs catalysts have been used either in homo- or heterogeneous phases in glycerol etherification reactions (Cannilla et al., 2014; Iwase et al., 2014; Srinivas et al., 2016). Indeed, the proton exchanges of HPAs by metal cations is an attractive approach to circumvent the leaching of solid-supported catalysts. In this sense, the cesium-exchanged HPAs salts are the most widely used either in acid-catalyzed or oxidation reactions (da Silva et al., 2020; Batalha et al., 2020). The conversion of Keggin HPAs to insoluble salts become still more desirable if the metal cation that replaces the protons is also a potential Lewis acid catalyst, such as the Sn(II) cations (Gonçalves et al., 2011; Da Silva et al., 2015). In this sense, we have exploited the synergism between these cations and Keggin HPAs catalysts, in acid-catalyzed reactions where different biomass derivatives were converted to more value-added products or biofuels (Chaves et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2017; Pinheiro et al., 2019). Sn(II) phosphotungstate demonstrated to be efficient acid catalysts when were used in glycerol etherification reactions. However, in that study, only some aspects were exploited (Da Silva et al., 2019). Sn(II)-dopped salts of different HPAs were also evaluated in that work, but, the salt of phosphomolybdic acid had the worst performance. Although it has been an embracing work, some questions were not solved, such as the main of them, how the Lewis and Brønsted acidity strength of catalysts impact their activity. In that work, only totally exchanged Sn(II) HPA salts were investigated as catalysts. In this work, we have synthesized salts of three Keggin heteropolyacids (i.e., H3PW12O40, H3PMo12O40 and H4SiW12O40), dopped with different loads of Sn(II) cations, and evaluating their catalytic performance in glycerol tert-butylation reactions with TBA. We selected the phosphomolybdate salts because their activity was more significantly impacted by the Sn(II) load, and analyzed more deeply their acidity properties. To do this, analyses of adsorbed pyridine FT-IR spectroscopy were used to determine the nature of acidic sites, and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption analyses were performed to measure the strength and amount of acid sites, besides the potentiometric titration with n-butylamine. All the catalysts were characterized by adsorption-desorption isotherms of N2, FT-IR, MEV-EDS, XRD and thermal analyses. The effects of the main reaction parameters were evaluated. Additionally, simulation of a developed flowsheet for the process and analysis of economic viability were also performed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All the reagents and solvent were used without previous treatment. Glycerol (99.5 wt%), tert-butyl alcohol (99.8 wt%), H4SiW12O40∙14 H2O, H3PW12O40∙6·H2O, H3PMo12O40·6H2O, SnCl2 (99.0 wt%) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Dodecane (99 wt%) was Vetec."
3,Synthesis and characterization of Sn(II) heteropoly salt catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis and characterization of Sn(II) heteropoly salt catalysts All the catalyst salts were synthesized in according to procedure adapted from literature (da Silva et al., 2020; Chaves et al., 2019). Typically, a solution of ethyl alcohol (ca. 5 mL) containing SnCl2 at stoichiometric amount, was slowly dropped to an aqueous solution (ca. 20 mL) containing the solved HPA (i.e., H3PW12O40, H3PMo12O40, or H4SiW12O40). The level of doping of Sn(II) was controlled using SnCl2 at an adequate stoichiometry. The resulting suspension was magnetically stirred and heated at 333 K/3 h. Afterward, the solvent was evaporated at 383 K and the salt obtained was dried in an oven 423 K/5 h and posteriorly calcined at 573 K/5h. Powder XRD-patterns of the catalysts were recorded in a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer, using Cu-Ka radiation and Ni filter, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The diffractograms were obtained in the 2θ range of 5–80°, 1 min−1. To calculate the crystallite size, the Scherrer Equation was applied to the most intense diffraction peak. The K and λ values were 0.89 and 1.5418 Å, respectively. (1) L = 0.9 λ/βcos θ Infrared spectra were recorded in a Varian 660-IR model Fourier Transformed Infrared coupled to the attenuated total reflectance accessory (FT-IR/ATR). Thermal analyses were carried out in a Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer (STA) 6000 Perkin Elmer equipment. Usually, the solid sample (ca. 10–15 mg) were heated at 10 K min−1 rate under nitrogen flux, with temperatures ranging from 303 to 973 K. Distribution and pore size were measured by the adsorption/desorption isotherms of N2 at 77 K in a NOVA 1200 Quantachrome equipment. Surface area was determined from BET equation applied to the isotherms with P/P0 varying from 0.05 a 0.32. Size and pore distribution were calculated through DFT method. Prior analyses, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 383 K/5 h. Initially, the acidity strength of catalyst salts was measured by potentiometric titration with n-butylamine in a potentiometer Bel, model W3B, as describe by Pizzio et al. (Sathicq et al., 2020). Typically; an adequate amount of solid HPA was suspended in CH3CN and stirred by 24 h. The amount of acid sites was determined by titration with n-butylamine solution in acetonitrile (ca. 0.025 molL-1). The nature of acidic sites of the catalysts was determined by the pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectroscopy. Normally, 10 mg of catalyst was weighed in a small cup and placed into a quartz tube inside a tubular oven. Afterward, the temperature of the oven was kept at 393 K and the sample was degassed for 2 h under a continuous flow of N2. After that, the temperature was lowered to 323 K under a continuous flow of pyridine for 2 h for the chemisorption step. Once completed the adsorption process, the oven temperature was adjusted to 393 K under the flow of N2 for 1 h for the removal from an eventual physiosorbed pyridine amount. FT-IR spectra were recorded in a Spectrum Perkin Elmer FT-IR RXI equipment in the range of 1700–1400 cm−1 (resolution of 2 cm−1 and 64 scans) and the discs were previously prepared by mixing 10 mg of the materials with 80 mg of KBr and pressing under vacuum for 3 min. The Ammonia Temperature-Programmed Desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed on CHEMBET-3000 TPR/TPD chemisorption analyzer (Quantachrome instrument). Typically, 0.2 g of solid was inserted in a U-shaped quartz tube and degassed for 1 h at 393 K under a He gas flux (ca. 80 mL/min). After the pretreatment, the sample was cooled to 323 K and kept in contact with the NH3 gas flux of 40 mL/min for 10 min. aiming to complete the saturation of the acidic sites. Then He was fluxed (ca. 40 L/min) for 10 min., without heating, to remove the physiosorbed NH3. Immediately after that, the material was heated up at a rate of 10 K/min to 1173 K. The morphology of the Sn(II)-dopped phosphomolybdate salts was characterized by scanning electron microscopy images (SEM), recorded in a JEOL JSM-6010/LA microscope. This equipment was fitted with an energy dispersive spectrometry system (EDS), to analyze the chemical composition of catalysts. All the SEM images and EDS spectra were recorded using 10 mm working distance and 20 KV acceleration voltage."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests All the catalytic runs were carried out in a sealed tube reactor, immerse in an oil bath with magnetic stirrer. Typically, glycerol (8.4 mmol), tert-butyl alcohol (33.7 mmol), and dodecane as internal stander (0.10 mL) were added to the reactor, and then 5 min stirred and heated to 363 K. Afterward, an exact amount of catalyst (ca. 0.0092 mmol, 0.2 mol % Sn(II) ions) was added to the reaction, and monitored by 240 min. At the end of the catalytic run, the reactor was cooled, and the aliquot was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC Shimadzu 2010 chromatographer, FID, RTX® WAX 20M capillary column ((30 m × 0,25 mm × 0,25 μm)). The temperature program was as follows: 80 °C/1 min, 10 °C/min up to 210 °C, hold time of 13 min. Temperatures of injector and detector were 250 °C. Previously, samples were diluted to 1:2 with ethyl alcohol. To calculate the reaction conversions, we compared the chromatographic peak area of product with the corresponding calibration curve. The main products were identified by GC-MS analysis (GC-MS 2010 ultra mass, operating at 70 eV), co-injection in GC equipment with authentic samples and by comparison with data previously reported in the literature (Chaves et al., 2019)."
5,Process simulation,2.4 Process simulation The process was developed and simulated using CHEMCAD 7.1 software. The material and energy balances are listed in supplementary material. UNIFAC thermodynamic model was used for the simulation of this process. The process main equipment design parameters are listed in the supplementary material.
6,Catalyst recovery,"2.5 Catalyst recovery Catalysts were easily recovered by liquid-liquid extraction method (water/ethyl acetate). The catalyst extracted to aqueous phase was obtained after solvent vaporization. After it to be dried 393 K in an oven, it was reused in another catalytic run."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Thermal analyses curves of the Sn(II) doped heteropoly salt and pristine HPA were performed (Fig. 1 ; Figs. 1SM, 2SM, supplementary material). The TG curve of H3PMo12O40 had a strong weight loss in the interval of 303–390 K, followed by a continuous decrease until 900 K (Fig. 1). In the TG curves of Sn(II) doped salts the first loss was less pronounced, and the process of weight loss occurred gradually with an increase in the temperature. These phenomena resulted in two intense peaks below the 450 K in the curves of DTG. It was assigned to loss of adsorbed (ca. < 393 K) or coordinated (ca. 390–550 K) water molecules (Mickek-Llnicka, 2009). At temperatures higher than 550 K, the Keggin anions of HPAs and their salts to metal oxides started to collapse giving their metal oxides (de Mattos et al., 2017). DSC curves of the acid and their salts showed endothermic peaks close to 800 K, which were ascribed to the conversion of anion constituent to oxides (i.e., SiO2, WO3, MoO3, and SnO2) (Fig. 1, Figs. 1SM, 2SM) (Sharma et al., 2013). This behavior was also observed in the TG-DTG curves of phosphotungstic and silicotungstic catalysts (Figs. 1SM, 2SM). However, different of phosphomolybdic acid, the TG curve of the phosphotungstic and silicotungstic acids had a profile like that of their salts. The thermal stability of the phosphotungstic catalysts was less impacted by Sn(II) doping, as demonstrated the DSC curves (Fig. SM1). The same was verified for the silicotungstic catalysts, nonetheless, the decomposition of Keggin anion was much more visible for these catalysts, which generated strong peak in the TG curves and an endothermic peak at 810 K, regardless the content of Sn(II) ions (Fig. 2SM). From TG/DSC curves we quantified the hydration water present in the thermally treated salts. Table 1 shows the data for Sn(II) doped HPAs salts and pristine acids. It was verified that the thermally treated precursor HPAs (ca. 573 K) had 16, 11, and 11 mol H2O/mol of catalyst, for phosphomolybdic, phosphotungstic, and silicotungstic acids (Table 1), respectively. Remarkably, even after the synthesis of the Sn(II) salts, which is followed by thermal treatment at 573 K, the coordination water molecules are still kept in Keggin anion (Table 1). It may affect either crystallinity or catalytic activity of these salts. The thermal stability of HPAs obeys the trend H3PW12O40 > H4SiW12O40 > H3PMo12O40 (Xian-e et al., 1997). Figs. 1; 1 SM, and 2SM confirm this sequence. Nonetheless, the doping with Sn(II) had a negative impact on the stability of tungsten catalysts (Fig. 2 ). A higher load of Sn(II) resulted in a lower decomposition temperature, as noticed in DSC curves (Figs. 1SM and 2SM). Conversely, this effect was different in phosphomolybdate catalysts; after the first proton exchange, no alteration was observed in the temperature of decomposition. However, the DSC curves of other Sn(II) doped molybdate presented no visible endothermal peak. The hydration level can affect the crystallinity of solid catalysts. In general, crystalline structures of heteropolyacids are classified as cubic, triclinic, or tetragonal (Mickek-Llnicka, 2009). Powder XRD patterns of heteropoly salt were compared to the acid precursor (Fig. 3 ). Comparing the three sets of diffractograms, the phosphotungstate catalysts presented a higher crystallinity than other HPAs. It was evidenced by a smaller background and better-defined peaks. Moreover, the doping of Sn(II) ions had little impacts on the profile of diffractograms obtained from phosphotungstate catalysts (Kumar et al., 2011). Conversely, silicotungstic and phosphomolybdic acids and their salts had a loss of crystallinity when a higher load of Sn(II) was incorporated into the Keggin anion. Only in the diffractogram of Sn1.5PW12O40 presented some new peaks (ca. 2θ 7.9°, 9.2°, 18.4°, 28.2°, and 31.7°; Fig. 3SM), however, the typical diffraction peaks of Keggin anion were kept constant. According to the literature, the total exchange of protons by metal cations (i.e., Cs+, Sm3+, Hf4+, Zr4+ e Zn2+) may shift some peaks toward a lower 2θ angle due to expansion of unity cell, and or result in new diffraction lines (Sandesh et al., 2015; Srinivas et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2012; Jagadeeswaraiah et al., 2014; Corma et al., 1996; Kumar et al., 2014; Pasha et al., 2019). It is consequence of greater radium of these ions if compared to the proton likewise Sn2+ ions (i.e., H+ = 0,35 Å and Sn2+ = 1,18 Å) (Sandesh et al., 2015). Comparatively to the diffraction patterns of phosphotungstate salts, the diffractogram of phosphomolybdic salts underwent enlargement and loss of intensity triggered by an increase in Sn(II) load (Fig. 4SM). It is suggestive that the size of crystallite is being reduced when a higher load of Sn(II) was present. Despite that, the main peaks remained visible, assuring the Keggin anion was intact. The same effect was previously verified when copper phosphomolybdate salts were synthesized (Viswanadham et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2018). The diffractograms of Sn(II) silicotungstate salts also revealed that the same effect happened when a higher load of Sn(II) was introduced on the silicotungstic anion (Fig. 5SM); while the typical diffraction lines remained present (ca., 2θ 7.9°, 9.4°, 16.0°, 26.4°, 28.4° e 33.0°), they were slightly shifted towards lower angles if compared to the phosphomolybdic acid diffraction peaks (Cai et al., 2018). We have not observed any diffraction peaks associated with stannous chloride (i.e., monoclinic pattern, ICSD 31762), used as dopant. The new peaks observed indicate that the Sn(II) load induces the formation of a new crystalline phase and the infrared analyses, shown in Fig. 4 , confirm that the Keggin anion (i.e., primary structure) remained intact. The particle sizes of HPA catalysts and their Sn(II) doped saltsH4SiW12O40 were calculated using the Scherrer Equation (1) (see Section 2.2.), applied to the most intense diffraction peak of the XRD pattern (Fig. 3), where λ corresponds to the Cu Kα radiation, and β is the full width at half-maximum for a reflection maximum located at 2θ. The main results are summarized in Table 2 . Regardless of the Keggin anion, an increase in Sn(II) load reduced the crystallite size. This effect was more pronounced in the phosphomolybdate salts. Infrared spectra of Sn(II) doped salts were recorded and compared to the pristine acids to verify if the primary structure of catalyst (i.e., heteropolyanion) remained unaltered after the proton exchanges by Sn2+ cations (Figs. 4–6 ). The fingerprint region shows the main absorption bands of Keggin anion (ca. 1200–400 cm−1 wavenumbers), which are assigned to the stretching of W (or Mo)O bonds, as well as the P (or Si)O bond vibrations. However, these spectra were shown until 1800 cm−1, to visualize the bands corresponding the typical vibrations of water molecules or protonated species (i.e., H3O+, H2O5 + ions), which generally give a broad absorption band at 1600–1700 cm−1. Although this band has a lower intensity in the infrared spectra of salts, it remains present due to the hydrolysis of Sn(II) ions, which produce those hydronium ions (Da Silva et al., 2017; Pinheiro et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2019). To do easier the attribution of bands in the fingerprint region, Oxygen atoms are distinguished in according to the place occupied in the Keggin anion; Ot are terminal Oxygen atoms, Ov are vertex Oxygen atoms, and Oa are edge Oxygen atoms (Coronel and da Silva, 2018; Popa et al., 2016). The main absorption bands of H3PW12O40 (Fig. 4) were seen at 1073, 972, 898 e 759 cm−1 wavenumbers, which were assigned to the vibrations of νas P-O, νas W = Ot, νas W-Ov-W, and νas W-Oa-W, respectively. When we analyzed the infrared spectra of Sn(II) doped salts, it was possible to verify a shift of band that was ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of νas W = Ot and νas W-Ov-W bonds, which were initially noticed at 972 and 898 cm−1, and were shifted to 962 and 880, respectively. It can be assigned to the presence of Sn(II) ions as counter ions between the Keggin ions (Chaves et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2011). The infrared spectra of phosphomolybdic catalysts are presented in Fig. 5. The main vibrations present in the spectrum of H3PMo12O40 acid and were seen at 1015, 977, 910 and 760 cm−1 wavenumbers, which attributed to the vibrations of νas P-O, νas Mo = O, νas Mo-Ov-Mo, and νas Mo-Oa-Mo respectively (Chaves et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2019). Likewise observed in the infrared spectrum of Sn(II) phosphotungstate salts, there was a shift of absorption bands noticed at 977 and 910 cm−1 toward lower wavenumbers (i.e., 966 and 905 cm−1, respectively). It suggests that the presence of Sn(II) ions weakens the MoO and MoOv Mo bonds. The infrared spectra obtained from the silicotungstate catalysts showed bands of SiO or WO bond vibrations, which were observed at 1015, 977, 910 e 750 cm−1 wavenumbers (Fig. 6). These bands were attributed to the following asymmetric stretching: νas Si-O, νas W = O, νas W-Ov-W e νas W-Oa-W, respectively. The same shift triggered by the introduction of Sn(II) cations in the phosphotungstic or phosphomolybdic acids was also verified in a band present in the infrared of Sn(II) silicotungstate: the band assigned to vibration of W = Ot was shifted to lower wavenumber (ca. 977 to 966 cm−1). A shoulder was noticed in the band at 876 cm−1, which was attributed to the overlapped of two bands, one assigned to the SiO bond stretching and the other to the W-Ov-W (Ov = vertex oxygen) (Alizadeh et al., 2008). Despites these effects, the infrared spectra of Sn(II) doped salts demonstrated that Keggin anions remained intact after the synthesis. The proton exchanges reduced the intensity of the absorption band attributed to the hydronium ions (i.e., 1700–1600 cm−1). This behavior was proportional to the level of Sn(II) doping. It is important to note that this band was not totally suppressed in the infrared spectra of Sn2SiW12O40 because the Sn(II) cations can be partially hydrolyzed, producing then the hydronium ions (Da Silva et al., 2017; Pinheiro et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2019). Surface area, size, and pores distribution of HPA catalysts were determined by BET and DFT methods, respectively (Table 3 ), through the isotherms of adsorption/desorption of N2 at 77 K (Figs. 6SM-8SM). The surface area can be evaluated by different methods, being the Multipoint BET the most used. For a long time, the literature has reported different surface areas for the commercial heteropolyacids, with values ranging from 2 to 14 m2/g (Hayashi and Moffat, 1982). Herein, it was also observed (Table 1). Conversely, for the Sn(II) doped salts, an increase in tin load resulted in a greater surface area. Nonetheless, the values were still close to those of pristine acids. The same happened to the porosimetry properties of Sn(II) salts, which were lower than those of precursor acids. This size of pore diameter suggests that they are mesoporous solid catalysts, which present pores with a diameter varying from 2 to 50 nm (Sing et al., 1985). According to IUPAC rules, the isotherms were classified as being intermediate between Type III and V. A slight hysteresis (i.e., type H3) was observed in isotherms of three pristine acids at relative pressure 0.4p/p0 (Figs. 6SM-8SM). It was more pronounced in the isotherms of phosphomolybdate salt (i.e., HSnPMo12O40). It was ascribed to the capillarity condensation in mesopores of solid catalysts, a consequence of adsorption on aggregates of platy particles (Thommes et al., 2015). In general, the other isotherms of adsorption/desorption were relatively narrow (Figs. 6SM-8SM). Although Keggin HPAs have been recognized as strong Bronsted acids, the partial or total replacement of their protons by Sn(II) cations can be the pivotal aspect that will be useful to rationalize their catalytic activity. Initially, n-butylamine potentiometric titrations were used to evaluate the strength and quantify the acid sites (Fig. 7 ). The measurements of initial electrode potential (Ei) provide a comparison of strength of the acid sites as follows; very strong (Ei > 100 mV); strong (0 < Ei < 100 mV), weak (−100 < Ei < 0 mV) and very weak (Ei < −100 mV) (Pizzio et al., 2003). The doping of the HPA catalysts by Sn(II) cations had a remarkable effect on the acidity strength of the heteropoly catalysts. While the potentiometric titration curves of pristine acids indicated the presence of the strongest acid sites (i.e., the highest Ei values), the titration of totally exchanged salts revealed that these sites were removed and or weakened. This is evidenced by the displacement of the titrimetric curves to lower potential values and to lower values of (mEq/g of solid) when increasing the degree of replacement of the protons by Sn(II) cations. It was possible from the equivalence point to quantify the acid sites. This value refers to Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. It is important to know that, similar to H3O+ ions, Sn(II) cations are also able to react with n-butylamine (Chaves et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2019). Pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to distinguish Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The absorption band between 1530 and 1540 cm−1 and 1630–1640 cm−1 are attributed to the vibrational mode of the pyridinium (Py-H+) and is related to the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) (Padovan et al., 2017). On the other hand, around 1610–1618 cm−1 (see Fig. 9SM in the supplementary information) are the bands ascribed to the vibrational mode of the pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites, (LAS, (Py-L)) (Bassan et al., 2013). Absorption bands at 1490 cm−1 wavenumber are simultaneously attributed to vibration mode of both protonated and coordinated pyridine, or Brønsted (BAS) and Lewis (LAS), respectively (Possato et al., 2020). The BAS and LAS quotient (B/L) was estimated by the ratio of intensities of absorption bands at (1545/1604) cm−1 wavenumbers, and the values found are 0.86, 1.17, 1.16, 1.13, and 1.27 for SnCl2, H2Sn0.5PMo12O40, HSnPMo12O40, Sn1.5PMo12O40, and H3PMo12O40, respectively (Fig. 8 ) (Da Silva et al., 2020). An expansion of Fig. 8 was shown in the supplementary material (Fig. 9SM). Brønsted acidity of H3PMo12O40 is well known due to the presence of protons. Conversely, Lewis acidity arises when the protons of H3PMo12O40 are exchanged by Sn(II) cations, and this acidity is associated with the coordinately unsaturated Sn2+ species in the catalyst. However, a part of Brønsted acidity is regenerated when Sn2+ ions undergo hydrolysis reacting with water molecules that remained in the catalyst, generating protons, with presented Brønsted sites as well (Da Silva et al., 2020). The B/L values indicate a gradual increase of the Lewis site as it is added Sn(II) to the H3PMo12O40 structure. These attributions agree with the literature (Kumar et al., 2011; Ahmed et al., 2013). Fig. 9 shows the TPD profiles of phosphomolybdate catalysts. The literature describes the Keggin heteropolyacids such as H3PMo12O40 possess only strong acidity of Brønsted type (Sasca et al., 2016). Comparatively to SnCl2, the Sn(II) doped catalysts showed significant ammonia desorption. Only an almost undetectable event above 973 K was noticed in the TDP curve of SnCl2. If the of acidity is stronger, higher is the temperature at which the ammonia is desorbed. Therefore, the desorption of ammonia occurs at temperature ranges of 423–573 K (i.e., weak strength sites), 573–773 K (i.e., medium strength sites), and temperatures higher than 773 K (i.e., strong strength sites) (Sasca et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018). Fig. 9 shows that the phosphomolybdate catalysts have most acid sites with medium and strong strength. To quantify these sites, the area of TCD signal was integrated and the man results are displayed n Table 4 . The HSnPMo12O40 catalyst presented the highest amount of strong acid sites, while the acid sites of other salts had a medium acidity strength. It could be expected that catalysts with a higher load of Sn(II) ions had Brønsted acid sites with a lower strength and in a lower amount. Nonetheless, the hydrolysis underwent by Sn(II) cations generate protonate species, as demonstrated by the infrared spectra of these salts, which have an absorption band at 1600 cm−1 (Figs. 4–6). Fig. 10 shows a comparison of adsorbed pyridine FT-IR spectra of phosphotungstic acid and their Sn(II) doped heteropoly salt after adsorption of pyridine. Similarly to the observed in the spectra of molybdic acid and their Sn(II) doped salt, there was a significant decrease in intensity of absorption band assigned to the hydrogen adsorbed pyridine at 1588 cm-1, as well as a remarkable increase of band typical of LA acid sites at 1609 cm−1 after the Sn(II) doping. The elemental composition of Sn(II) doped phosphomolybdate catalysts were determined from EDS analyses (Table 1SM). There was an acceptable concordance between theoretical and experimental results. MEV images (insets in Fig. 11 ) show that grains of different sharpness and sizes were noticed, depending on the Sn(II) load. EDS spectra and MEV images were also recorded of totally substituted phosphotungstate and silicotungstate catalysts as well as their elemental composition (Table 2SM). The results confirm that all the catalysts were successfully synthesized."
9,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests 3.2.1 Effect of Sn(II) load on the activity of phosphotungstic, silicotungstic, phosphomolybdate catalysts in etherification reactions of glycerol with TBA Previously, we had assessed the glycerol etherification over phosphotungstate and silicotungstate catalysts (Da Silva et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2020). However, the effect of Sn(II) load was not measured. In this work, we have investigated this effect in the glycerol etherification using tert-butyl alcohol and following the reaction conditions reported in the literature (Fig. 12 ). Without a catalyst, only a poor conversion of glycerol was observed. It was preferentially converted to oligomers, the undesirable products herein, probably due to the reaction temperature, which was enough to promote the condensation of glycerol molecules. They are highly oxygenated products, undetectable by GC analyses but determined through reaction mass balance. To understand this phenomenon, an internal standard was used, besides the calibration curves built with the purified products; hence, it was possibly to verify if all the consumed glycerol was converted to detectable products by GC analyses (Martin and Richter, 2011). Conversely, although the reaction conditions have not been optimized to reach high conversion and selectivity, the addition of heteropoly catalysts (i.e., acid or salts) strongly impacted both the conversion and selectivity of the processes. It is important to highlight that regardless of the Keggin anion, all the acids were totally soluble, while the salts were only partially soluble. Comparing the performance of HPAs and their salts, we noticed that the reactions in the presence of silicotungstic or phosphotungstic acids achieved a conversion close to those accomplished by their salts (Fig. 12a and 12b; Table 3SM); on the other hand, phosphomolybdic acid-catalyzed reaction achieved a poor conversion if compared to the totally exchanged Sn(II) salt (Fig. 12c). The selectivity toward ethers glycerol and the reaction conversions are seemly connected; reactions in the presence of H4SiW12O40 or H3PW12O40 achieved higher conversions and ethers selectivity than that reached in the H3PW12O40-catalyzed reactions (Table 3SM). Scheme 1 shows the main glycerol ethers produced in the reactions; the steric hindrance led to the formation of terminal mono-ether (1-MTGB) and di-ether (1,3-DTBG). Therefore, we will consider only these two products and the TTBG in the next results. Silicotungstate and phosphotungstate catalysts had a similar catalytic performance; an increase in Sn(II) load had only a slight increase in conversion of glycerol. Contrariwise, when the same happened in phosphomolybdate-catalyzed reactions, there was a remarkable effect; as higher the Sn(II) load, greater was the glycerol conversion and ethers selectivity. It is noteworthy that although omitted in Fig. 12, SnCl2-catalyzed reactions achieved a poor conversion, likewise the blank reactions. The effect of Sn(II) ions doping on the phosphomolybdate becomes clearer by looking at Fig. 13 a and b, and in Table 4SM. An almost linear relation between the Sn(II) load and the conversion was observed. Analyses of infrared spectroscopy showed that the primary structure (i.e., Keggin anion) of Sn(II) doped salts was preserved after the synthesis (Figs. 4–6). Equally, the isotherms of adsorption/desorption of N2 suggested that the porosimetry of HPAs and their salts were similar. Nonetheless, powder XRD patterns evidenced that some changes occurred in the secondary structure of HPAs catalysts after the Sn(II) doping (Fig. 2). Particularly, the phosphomolybdate salts had a loss of crystallinity and diminishment of the size of crystallite when the Sn(II) load was being gradually increased (Table 2). Possibly, this last modification affects the active sites of these catalysts. It is possible the acidic sites were present in the amorphous phase. We conclude that the nature and the strength of acidic sites play an essential role in the efficiency of phosphomolybdate catalysts. The catalyst with the highest Lewis acidity was the most efficient (i.e., Sn1.5PMo12O40), while that with the greatest Brønsted acidity was the worst (i.e., H3PMo12O40) (Fig. 12c, Fig. 9SM). The NH3-TPD profile of phosphomolybdate catalysts shows that contrarily to the phosphomolybdic acid, which have preferentially strong acidic sites (Estevez et al., 2017), the Sn1.5PMo12O40 salt has acid sites with medium and strong strength in an almost equal proportion. It seems to be a key aspect for the success of this catalyst. 3.2.2 Effect of Sn1.5PMo12O40 catalyst load in glycerol etherification reaction with TBA Aiming to verify this effect, we carried out the catalytic runs keeping constant the other reaction parameters. The catalyst load in relation to the glycerol was varied from 0.1 to 0.4 mol% (Fig. 14 , Table 5SM). With an equal load or higher than 0.2 mol%, no significant change was noticed in the conversion or reaction selectivity. So, the catalyst load was not increased above this level. 3.2.3 Effect of molar proportion of reactants in Sn1.5PMo12O40-catalyzed glycerol etherification reactions with TBA The glycerol etherification is a reversible reaction and therefore it is sensitive to an increase in reactants concentration. It is recognized that higher conversions of glycerol with different selectivities could be reached by using different molar proportions of glycerol to TBA. The catalyst-free reactions reached poor conversions, regardless of the excess of TBA (Fig. 15 ; Table 6SM). In addition, under these conditions, glycerol oligomers were the main products. The oligomers are probably formed through glycerol condensation reactions since that formation of isobutylene oligomers generated by dehydration of TBA is less favorable in acidic catalyst-free conditions. Conversely, when 0.2 mol % of catalyst was used, high conversion (ca. 80%) was achieved with a beneficial gain of selectivity; only mono and di glycerol ethers were obtained, without the formation of undesirable glycerol oligomers. In Fig. 12SM, after GC-MS analyses, we showed that amount of isobutylene formed when the Sn(II) heteropoly salt is present. Although the formation of isobutylene lead to the releasing of water, it had only a minimum impact on the reaction yield. 3.2.4 Impacts of temperature on the Sn1.5PMo12O40-catalyzed glycerol etherification reaction with TBA The reaction temperature has great importance in the etherification reactions of glycerol because it determines which conditions may provide the lower energy barrier for the reactant molecules can be efficiently converted toward glycerol ethers. To assess this effect, reactions were carried at temperatures of 353–383 K (Fig. 16 , Table 7SM). We have found that an increase in the temperature in the range of 353–363 K favored the increase of glycerol conversion. However, at temperatures higher than 373 K there was a significant decrease in the conversion, although the selectivity to DTBG has been improved. The same effect occurred in a previous study, in which we performed a simulation using Aspen Plus v.10 software to see the behavior of the reagents at a range of studied temperatures (Sun et al., 2018). The phase diagram obtained through simulation in that work showed that at temperatures higher than 363 K, the TBA is preferentially in the gas phase, therefore, since the reaction occurs in the liquid phase the conversion is compromised, due to the lower feasibility of molecules to react, as already shown in the literature (Yuan et al., 2014). Another effect is the formation of oligomers (Fig. 16), which are favored at higher temperatures. Esteves et al., who investigated the glycerol etherification over aluminum organosilicon-phosphates attributed the decrease in conversion to the dehydration of TBA, which also promotes the TBA oligomerization (Estevez et al., 2017). 3.2.5 Monitoring the conversion and selectivity of Sn1.5PMo12O40-catalyzed glycerol etherification reactions with TBA The reaction kinetics as well as the products selectivity were monitored, and the main results are shown in Fig. 17 . We realize that using the optimized conditions (i.e., 0.2 mol % of Sn1.5PMo12O40 catalyst, 363 K, and 1:8 glycerol: TBA proportion) the reactions reached the highest conversion after 4 h reaction. The consecutive character of reactions was also confirmed; the MTBG selectivity was being gradually diminished during the reaction, resulting in a higher DTBG selectivity (Table 8SM). The formation of the most substituted ethers was not significant; after 4 h of run, a minimum amount of TTBG was detected after this time. aReaction conditions: Glycerol (4.6 mmol), tert-butyl alcohol (36.8 mmol), Sn1.5PMo12O40 (0.2 mol %), temperature (363 K), internal standard (dodecane, 0.100 mL), reaction volume (4 mL). It is essential to note that the stabilization of reaction conversion happened when the autogenous pressure of the system was reached (ca. 3.8 bar). When the reaction is started, the pressure gradually increases until 3.8 bar, during a time of 4 h. It is an indicative that the reaction mechanism per pass by the formation of isobutylene, as previously described by us (Da Silva et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2020). Additionally, if the reaction could be carried out by longer periods, the DTBG and TTBG formation should be enhanced. It is important to highlight that we consider the reaction conditions (i.e., reactant molar ratio, Sn(II) load), the catalytic performance of Sn1.5PMo12O40 was most efficient higher than other Sn(II) heteropoly salts (i.e., Sn2SiW12O40, Sn1.5PW12O40), as well as others Brønsted acids (Table 8SM) (Da Silva et al., 2019; Da Silva et al., 2020)."
10,Process simulation,"3.3 Process simulation A developed process flow diagram (PFD) to produce MTBG & DTBG is shown in Fig. 18 . The process simulation was based on the glycerol tert-butylation catalytic experiments that described before. The process was developed and simulated using CHEMCAD 7.1 software. The conversion of glycerol was selected at 54% with 92% selectivity of MTBG and 8% of DTBG. As in the experimental work, the feed ratio of TBA/glycerol is maintained around 8 at the reactor entrance. At these operating conditions, no oligomers were formed in the product stream. The thermodynamic model used for the process simulation was UNIFAC. In this plant, glycerol feed is mixed with the recycled unreacted glycerol and sent to a pump (P-101) to increase the pressure. In the same manner, TBA feed and recycled unreacted TBA are pumped using P-102 before mixing with the glycerol stream. The mixture of glycerol and TBA is sent to a packed-bed isothermal reactor (R-101) which is operated at 363 K and 3.8 bar. The reaction occurs in the liquid phase and is endothermic. A low-pressure steam jacket is used to maintain the temperature at around 363 K. The reactor effluent which consists of products, byproduct (wastewater), glycerol and TBA is cooled in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger (E-101) and then entered a distillation column (T-101). The products and unreacted glycerol are separated in the bottoms (stream No. 13). The unreacted TBA and byproduct (water) are separated as the top product (stream No. 11). MTBG, DTBG and glycerol are sent to a second distillation column (T-102) where glycerol is separated in the bottoms while products are separated as the top of the column and cooled in E-108 to about 303 K before sending this stream to a storage vessel. The TBA-water mixture forms an azeotrope at certain compositions (see Fig. 10SM). To break the TBA-water azeotrope, we have used glycerol as an entrainer (solvent) for the extractive distillation. The residue curve map of the TBA-Water-glycerol mixture is shown in Fig. 11SM. This azeotropic TBA/water stream is sent to an extractive distillation column (T-103) which is operated above the atmospheric pressure (1.2–1.4 bar). The solvent (glycerol) is fed at the top (rectifying section) of the extractive column which consists of 24 theoretical stages. The azeotropic TBA/water is fed at the stripping section at stage 20. In this process, water is added to the TBA-water feed, to shift the azeotropic point and makes the separation possible with minimal entrainer (glycerol). The TBA lost in the bottoms is decreased to about 0.49 kmol/h. In addition, this technique lowers the temperature of the column reboiler where a medium-pressure steam (mps) is used instead of high-pressure steam (hps). The glycerol and water are separated as the bottom product and sent to a solvent recovery column (T-104). Glycerol is recovered at the column bottoms and used to generate medium pressure steam which is used for the reboiler of the first distillation column. The entrainer is further cooled and recycled back to the extractive distillation column. On the other hand, TBA is separated at the top of the extractive column (T-103) at high purity and recycled back to the reaction section. The wastewater is separated at the top of the recovery column (T-104) and then cooled before sending to a water treatment unit. Table 5 shows the overall process material balance along with the consumption factors of the feed materials per ton of the product. The consumption factors of glycerol and TBA per ton of product (MTBG & DTBG) are 0.6125 and 0.5356, respectively. The compositions of MTBG and DTBG are 92 mol% and 8 mol%, respectively. The detailed material and energy balances of the process are shown in Supplementary Table 9SM."
11,Economic analysis,"3.4 Economic analysis An economic analysis of the glycerol etherification process is necessary for determining the plant profitability. All equipment of the plant were sized and used to determine the purchase costs. The purchased equipment costs were determined using the CHEMCAD costing package where the chemical engineering plant index (CEPI) of year 2019 was used. Fig. 19 shows the process equipment installed costs distribution. Note that the condensers and reboilers of the distillation columns are included with the heat exchangers. A summary of equipment design parameters and purchased costs are listed in Supplementary Table 10SM. The plant is assumed to operate for 8016 hr/y (334 days) as a contentious process for an annual capacity of 30,000 metric tons. The main raw materials used for the manufacturing of glyceryl tert-butyl ethers are glycerol and TBA. The prices of raw materials, utilities and product are listed in Table 6 . The distribution of utilities costs used for the process is shown in Fig. 19. The high-pressure steam (hps) represents 44% of the total utilities costs, followed by the medium pressure steam (mps) which represents 31% of the total utilities’ costs. The process is energy intensive in the purification section. The high-pressure steam is needed for the reboilers of T-102 and T-104 since glycerol has a high boiling point. Production costs are related to the fixed capital investment costs as well as operating costs (Fig. 20 ). The production costs include three distinct cost elements: direct costs, indirect costs, and general expenses (Bozkurt et al., 2019). The total production costs of the plant are about US $32 million. The raw materials represent about 63% of the total operating costs. Details of the items of total production costs are listed in Supplementary Table 11SM. Fig. 21 shows the cost distribution of the total production costs. The return on investment (ROI) is used as the measure of profitability. ROI is defined as the yearly profit divided by the total fixed capital investment. The profit is defined as the difference between income sales (revenue) and all expenses (Samoilov et al., 2020). A return on investment of at least 25 percent based on pre-tax earnings is usually expected. Table 7 shows some economic and profitability indicators, which are useful for evaluating the feasibility of the process."
12,Sensitivity analysis,"3.5 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of price change of product on the profitability of the plant. The product is a specialty chemical which has fluctuated prices. Fig. 22 shows that profitability is sensitive to the product price. When the product price decreases to US $ 1350/ton, the ROI also decreases to 5.56% which makes the process not feasible. On the other hand, if the product price increases to US $1650/ton, the ROI becomes 43.09% which is attractive economic indicator. The process profitability is also sensitive to the glycerol feed price, as it was very volatile during the last decades. The ROI could dramatically decrease to 9.78% if the price of glycerol escalates to $700/ton."
13,Conclusions,"The phosphomolybdic acid salts were successfully synthesized with different Sn(II) loads, and evaluated in reactions of glycerol etherification with TBA at different conditions. FT-IR, BET, EDS, XRD, TG-DSC analyses were used to characterize all the catalysts. The effect of Sn(II) doping was evaluated in silicotungstic, phosphotungstic, and phosphomolybdic acids. The Sn1.5PMO12O40 demonstrated to be the most efficient and selective catalyst. The impacts of the main reaction parameters were investigated. The glycerol: TBA molar ratio 1:4, a catalyst load (0.2 mol %), 363 K temperature, and 4 h of the reaction were the more adequate reaction conditions. The efficiency of catalysts was discussed in terms of Brønsted and Lewis acidity·NH3-TPD and pyridine FT-IR analyses demonstrated that Lewis acidity sites and Brønsted acid sites with medium strength plays an essential role in catalyst activity. Experimental observations indicated that the reaction pathway involves the formation of isobutylene, likewise other HPAs reported in literature. A process to produce mono and di glyceryl-tert-butyl-ethers was developed and designed for an annual plant capacity of 30,000 metric tons. An economic analysis was performed which shows that the process is very attractive with a ROI of about 30.7%."
