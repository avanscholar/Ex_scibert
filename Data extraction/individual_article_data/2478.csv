0,Introduction,"As is well-known, many traditional organic transformations and synthesis are generally carried out under high temperature and high pressure accompanied by energy consumption and environmental pollution. Therefore, it is imperative to find a clean and efficient organic synthesis method instead of traditional industrial synthesis. Photocatalysis as a promising technique based on the semiconductor has aroused wide interest because of its potential applications in clean energy and environmental remediation [1–4]. Up to now, photocatalytic selective transformations and synthesis of organics have attracted extensive attention due to its green process and feasible application in industry [5–11]. Among them, the photocatalytic selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes under oxygen condition, and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline under nitrogen atmosphere have been considerably investigated. It is known that the aromatic aldehydes are widely utilized as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, and aniline is also an important chemical intermediate used for the synthesis of dyes, resins, pharmaceuticals and thiofide [12–14]. However, traditional oxidation methods for aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes need stoichiometric oxidants, such as permanganate and dichromate, etc. These reaction processes generate a mass of heavy-metal waste by-products. Aniline is synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. The catalysts (such as transition and noble metals) used in the reaction process are expensive, and it also generates an amount of heavy-metal pollutant [15–18]. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to develop an environmentally friendly method for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. The use of solar energy to drive organic reactions under mild conditions by semiconductor materials provides a sustainable pathway for green synthesis [19–23]. Unfortunately, their conversion and selectivity are poor. One of the prime reasons may be that the photocatalytic selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols needs oxygen to eliminate the photoexcited electrons, and photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene requires organics (such as methanol) to remove the photogenerated holes. Thus, the actual utilization ratio of photoexcited electron-hole pairs is low. The designed photocatalysts used in the reactions have not reached what we expected. Recently, simultaneously photocatalytic selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aromatic aldehydes by photogenerated holes and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline by photogenerated electrons in a coupled system has been realized by our group [24–26]. Moreover, we also know that aromatic aldehydes and aniline in a reaction system can further interact to generate Schiff base compounds. The Schiff bases are covalent RCN linkage compounds produced by condensation polymerization of amine and active carbonyl compounds, which can be widely used in various fields, such as medical science and chemical industry [27,28]. If Schiff base compounds can be produced by photocatalytically technology, a green synthesis method in the field of organic synthesis is established. The challenge for achieving the goal is to develop photocatalysts that can selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline effectively. Very recently, metalchalcogenide as photocatalysts for hydrogen production from H2O, reduction of CO2 and selective oxidation of organics have been investigated extensively because of its appropriate band gap, positions of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) [29–31]. The solid solution CdXZn1−XS semiconductor catalyst is also widely studied because of its excellent photocatalytic performance and chemical stability [32–36]. More importantly, the appropriate band edges and band gap of CdXZn1−XS provide a possibility for photocatalytically producing Schiff base in the coupled system of aromatic alcohols and nitrobenzene. In this paper, CdXZn1−XS photocatalysts were successfully fabricated by a simple wet chemistry process at room temperature. The as-synthesized CdXZn1−XS samples exhibit outstanding photocatalytic performance for the photocatalytic selective synthesis of Schiff bases in a coupled system of aromatic alcohols and nitrobenzene using N2 and visible light. When Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample is used as a photocatalyst, the highest yield of Schiff base reaches up to 55.2% under visible light irradiation for 4 h. The changes of intermediate products (aromatic aldehydes and aniline) produced in the reaction process are also investigated. To the best of our knowledge, one-pot synthesis of Schiff base compounds in the coupled system of aromatic alcohols and nitrobenzene instead of aldehydes and aniline by photocatalysis method has not been reported."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate [Cd(NO3)2·4H2O], zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O], sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O), benzotrifluoride (BTF), methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), ethylene glycol (EG) and other chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments."
3,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts A series of CdXZn1−XS (X = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0) samples were synthesized via a simple wet-chemical method using Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Na2S·9H2O as Cd, Zn and S sources, respectively. In a typical procedure, 5× mmol Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 5(1 − X) mmol Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water by constantly stirring to form a homogeneous solution. After that, 20 mL of 0.25 M Na2S·9H2O aqueous solution was added dropwise into the above solution with vigorous stirring for about 30 min. Then the reaction was further stirred for 2 h under ambient conditions. The resulted yellow slurry was centrifuged, washed several times with water, and then dried in an oven under 80 °C for 24 h. The as-prepared CdXZn1−XS powders were ground in the mortar before further use."
4,Characterization of samples,"2.3 Characterization of samples The crystallographic structures of CdXZn1−XS samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm), and a scanning speed of 3°/min. The crystallite size of the samples can be calculated by X-ray line broadening analysis according to the Scherrer formula. The elemental analysis was carried out on an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer, ELAN9000). The UV–Vis absorption spectra of synthesized samples were obtained on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Lambda850). Microcrystalline structure and surface characteristics of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (S4800/FEI-quanta-200F). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were performed with a FEI-G2 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) was used to determine the specific surface and pore size distribution of the as-prepared samples by ASAP2020 instrument.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab250 spectrometer, which consists of monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source, a hemispheric analyzer, and a sample stage with multiaxial adjustability to obtain the surface composition of the sample. The (photo)electrochemical experiments were conducted in a three-electrode system (CHI-660D, Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China), and a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300E7, Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd) with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as a photo source in the experiments."
5,Photocatalytic tests,"2.4 Photocatalytic tests The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples was evaluated by selective photocatalytic synthesis of Schiff base compounds in an autoclave fitted with a top Pyrex window. The detail procedure was implemented as follows: 0.1 g catalyst was dispersed in 15 mL benzotrifluoride (BTF) containing aromatic alcohol (0.0255 M) and nitrobenzene (0.0085 M), and then the mixture was transferred into a closed 100 mL autoclave, which was filled with a 0.1 MPa pressure of nitrogen. Before the visible light irradiation, the autoclave was placed on magnetic stirrer and was stirred for 30 min to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the reactants. The suspension reaction solution was irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (CEL-HXF300E7, Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd) with cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm). The temperature of the reactant solution was maintained at 50 °C by a flow of cooling water during the reaction. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rmp for 10 min to completely remove the catalyst particles. The obtained reaction solutions were analyzed qualitatively by gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Agilent 5975C-7890A) and were determined quantitatively with a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014C, Japan) equipped with an SE-30 capillary column. Conversion, yield and selectivity for Schiff base product, selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols to target products (aldehydes) and reduction of nitrobenzene to target product (aniline) were defined as follows: (1) Conversion ( % ) = [ ( C 0 - C r ) / C 0 ] × 100 (2) Yield ( % ) = C t / C 0 × 100 (3) Selectivity ( % ) = [ C t / ( C 0 - C r ) ] × 100 where C0 is the initial concentration of reactant; Cr and Ct are the remaining concentrations of reactant and target product at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction, respectively. It is worth noting that the yield of the Schiff base is based on the initial concentration of nitrobenzene. The theoretical yield of benzaldehyde should include one third of the amount of Schiff base compound, and the theoretical yield of aniline should contain equalamount of Schiff base compound."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of photocatalysts 3.1.1 XRD analysis The structure properties and phase compositions of the CdXZn1−XS samples (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1 , all CdXZn1−XS samples exhibit similar XRD patterns. The peaks located at about 28.6°, 47.5° and 56.4° could be indexed as (1 1 1), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) facets, respectively. It indicates that all of the CdXZn1−XS samples were zinc blende phase (JCPDS No. 65-0309). And the broad diffraction peaks may be attributed to its small crystallite size. By the calculation using the Scherrer formula, the average crystallite sizes of CdXZn1−XS samples (X = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0) are about 3.21, 3.12, 3.07, 2.99, 3.29, 3.46 and 5.88 nm, respectively. Furthermore, no impurity peaks were detected on all the CdXZn1−XS samples, suggesting a high purity of the as-synthesized products. This result is also supplemented by ICP-MS measurements. The values are 0, 0.21, 0.41, 0.61, 0.78, 0.89 and 1.0, respectively, which are in accordance with the initial theoretical values. 3.1.2 XPS analysis The surface chemical composition and electronic state of the as-synthesized Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum of Cd0.78Zn0.22S and high resolution core spectra for Cd 3d, Zn 2p, S 2p are displayed in Fig. 2 . It indicates that no peaks of other elements except Cd, Zn, S, C and O were observed. The peaks of C and O are originated from the graphite conductive adhesive and the absorbed gaseous molecules, respectively. From Fig. 2b, it is clear that the Cd 3d core splits into Cd 3d5/2 (405.0 eV) and Cd 3d3/2 (412.2 eV) peaks, which are consistent with the values for Cd2+. Zn 2p core shows two peaks at 1022.0 eV (Zn 2p3/2) and 1045.2 eV (Zn 2p1/2) (See Fig. 2c), corresponding to Zn2+. The S 2p peaks of CdXZn1−XS sample at 161.3 and 162.5 eV belong to S2−, which is ascribed to S coordinated to Zn and Cd in the resulted sample (Fig. 2d). This result matches well with the as-prepared samples and the previous report [33]. Hence, it is concluded that the CdXZn1−XS samples are successfully synthesized by wet-chemical process at room temperature. 3.1.3 UV–vis absorption spectra Fig. 3 displays the UV–vis absorption spectra of the CdXZn1−XS (0 ≤ X ≤ 1) samples. It can be seen that with the increase of Cd amount in the samples, the spectra of the resulted samples show a remarkable redshift, and the colors of the corresponding samples change from white to reddish orange gradually (See the inset of Fig. 3a). It is known that the band gap energy of semiconductors can be calculated by the following formula: (4) ah υ = A ( h υ - E g ) n / 2 where a, h, υ, A, Eg and n correspond to constant, the Planck constant, optical frequency, function coefficient, band gap energy and absorption coefficient, respectively, and n is determined by the type of semiconductors (direct transition n = 1; indirect transition n = 4). According to the previous report, we know that the CdXZn1−XS (0 ≤ X ≤ 1) samples are indirect transition semiconductors [37]. Therefore, Eg values of CdXZn1−XS (0 ≤ X ≤ 1) samples are estimated from the plot of (hν) versus (ahν)1/2 in Fig. 3b. It reveals that the Eg values of the CdXZn1−XS samples are range from 1.90 to 3.00 eV, and with the increase of Cd amount, Eg values of CdXZn1−XS become smaller. Meanwhile, it indicates that the photoabsorptions of CdXZn1−XS samples except ZnS are in the visible light region (≤2.2 eV). The VB and CB values of the samples can be calculated by Eqs. (5) and (6). (5) E CB = X - 0.5 E g - 4.5 (6) E VB = X + 0.5 E g - 4.5 where ECB, EVB, X and Eg are the potential energy of the CB bottom, the potential energy of the VB top, the Mulliken electronegativity of the constituent atoms, and the band-gap energy, respectively. Based on the above calculation, the band gap, VB and CB values of ZnS, CdS and CdXZn1−XS samples are summarized in Table S1. For example, the band-gap energy of Cd0.78Zn0.22S is 2.1 eV, and the VB and CB values are 1.11 and −0.99 eV, respectively. 3.1.4 SEM and TEM analyses SEM and TEM analysis were performed to investigate the morphology and microstructures of the samples. As shown in Fig. 4 a and b, it can be seen that the CdXZn1−XS samples was consisted of small nanoparticles with the particle size of about 5–20 nm, and the result is in accordance with that of XRD. Meanwhile, some nanoparticles get agglomerated. It can be observed from Fig. 4c that the Cd0.78Zn0.22S samples comprised of block-based flakiness with irregular shape, and the black part is caused by a part of the particle aggregation. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample is presented in Fig. 4d. Various lattice fringes with different orientations reveal that these nanoparticles have characteristic of poly-crystalline in nature and exhibit random orientations [33]. The result suggests that the interplanar spacing of 0.312 nm is consistent with the (1 1 1) crystal plane of zinc blende phase for Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample. Furthermore, the element mapping images show the same profile as shown in the rectangle area, and the Cd, Zn and S elements were uniformly distributed in the sample (Fig. 4e–h). 3.1.5 BET analysis The specific surface area and pore-size distribution of the samples were estimated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The adsorption-desorption isotherm curves of the as-prepared samples are displayed in Fig. 5 . We can find that the Cd0.78Zn0.22S, Cd0.89Zn0.11S and CdS samples all exhibit IV type adsorption isotherms according to IUPAC classification, implying that the samples have mesoporous structures. In order to obtain the nature of the mesoporous structures, the TEM images were further investigated. It can be found that Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample doesn’t have porous structure itself (Fig. S1). The reason for the mesopores detected by BET may be derived from the accumulated gaps between the nanoparticles. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Cd0.78Zn0.22S and Cd0.89Zn0.11S have similar pore size distribution (1–20 nm). The average pore diameter of Cd0.78Zn0.22S and Cd0.89Zn0.11S are approximately 6.117 and 6.774 nm, respectively. Whereas CdS sample shows a pore size of 1–30 nm and the average pore diameter is about 9.705 nm. Meanwhile, the special surface areas of Cd0.78Zn0.22S, Cd0.89Zn0.11S are higher than that of CdS sample. The surface area of Cd0.78Zn0.22S, Cd0.89Zn0.11S and CdS are 148.25, 147.23 and 89.40 m2·g−1, respectively. And the pore volumes of Cd0.78Zn0.22S, Cd0.89Zn0.11S and CdS are about 0.0227, 0.0226 and 0.0104 cm3·g−1, respectively."
8,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activities of the CdXZn1−XS samples were evaluated by photocatalytic selective synthesis of Schiff base in a coupled system of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The results are shown in Fig. 6 . It is clear that for the ZnS sample, there is no photocatalytic activity for the production of Schiff base. It is because that the band gap of ZnS is about 3.0 eV, and it cannot be excited in the visible light range. From Fig. 6c, it is obvious that when the illumination time is 2 h, the yields of Schiff base in the reaction system are 15.8, 16.1, 17.1, 36.8, 33.0 and 29.4% for CdXZn1−XS samples (X = 0.21, 0.41, 0.61, 0.78, 0.89 and 1), respectively. The yield of Schiff base increases with the increase of Cd content up to X = 0.78, and when the amount of Cd exceed 0.78, the yield of Schiff base decrease gradually. Meanwhile, it can be found from Fig. 6 a-b that the trends of the yield and selectivity of benzaldehyde and aniline are similar to the result of Schiff base. In other words, the yield and selectivity of benzaldehyde and aniline increase with the increase of Cd amount up to X = 0.78. As shown in Fig. 6a, when X = 0.21, 0.41, 0.61, 0.78, 0.89 and 1, the yield of selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde are 60.3, 62.3, 65.4, 86.6, 82.3 and 57.4%, respectively (Purple bar chart). In view of consumed benzaldehyde amount in the Schiff base reaction, the actual yields of benzaldehyde are 65.6, 67.7, 71.1, 98.9, 93.3 and 67.2%, respectively (Purple and yellow bar graph). Similarly, the yields of aniline are 10.4, 15.6, 13.8, 35.0, 14.8 and 15.8% for different samples, respectively. And the actual yields of aniline (Purple bar plus yellow bar) produced in the reaction system are 26.2, 31.7, 30.9, 71.8, 47.8 and 45.2%, respectively. By comparison, it is concluded that the Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample exhibits the best photocatalytic performance. For convenience, the Cd0.78Zn0.22S is chosen as a representative to further study the reaction of Schiff base and the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. Meanwhile, the reduction reaction/oxidation reaction ratios for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline and oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in the reaction system were calculated. The result is shown in Table S2. It can be seen that the reduction reaction/oxidation reaction ratios for the CdXZn1−XS samples are close to 1/3, which is in accordance with the photocatalytic reaction process. Namely, the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is a 2-hole oxidation reaction, and the photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline is a 6-electron reduction reaction. The photocatalytic activities of the Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample in the different solvents (acetonitrile and toluene) were also carried out under visible light illumination for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. The result is shown in Fig. S2. It is clear that when benzotrifluoride was used as a reaction solvent, the yields of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base are higher than those of acetonitrile and toluene used as the solvents. The effect of initial molar ratio of benzyl alcohol/nitrobenzene on the reaction was also investigated. From Fig. S3, it can be seen that the different molar ratios of benzyl alcohol/nitrobenzene have an obvious effect on the yields of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base. When the initial molar ratios of benzyl alcohol/nitrobenzene are close to 3 (such as 2:1 and 4:1), the yields of Schiff base are relative high. However, when the initial ratios of benzyl alcohol/nitrobenzene deviate from 3 (such as 1:2 and 1:3), the yields of Schiff base are low. According to the above results, it is clear that when the initial molar ratio of benzyl alcohol/nitrobenzene is close to 3, which is favorable for the reaction of Schiff base. To effect of reaction temperature on the reaction is shown in Fig. 7 , it is obvious that the yield of Schiff base increases with the increase of temperature gradually. For example, when the temperature is 30 °C, the yields of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base are 74.3%, 28.7% and 23.4%, respectively; and when the temperature is 80 °C, the yields of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base are 84.4%, 42% and 38.8%, respectively. It means that the reaction temperature has obvious influence on the reaction in the conditions. Fig. 8 shows the time-dependent photocatalytic performance of Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample. The yields of Schiff base are 36.8, 55.2, 51.7 and 42.9% under light illumination for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h, respectively. It is clear that the yield of Schiff base reaches maximum after illumination for 4 h. Meanwhile, the yields of benzaldehyde are 86.6, 78.2, 72.6 and 82.3%, and the yields of aniline are 35.0, 12.7, 13.7 and 19.5% under illumination for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h, respectively. Itisprobablybecause the Schiff base reaction is a dynamic equilibrium between benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base. Based on the above results, it is clear that CdXZn1−XS samples exhibit excellent photocatalytic performance for the production of Schiff base in the coupled system of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene. In order to study the commonality of the CdXZn1−XS samples, the Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample was chosen to evaluate the photocatalytic activities for Schiff bases in the system of different aromatic alcohols and nitrobenzene. Herein, p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol and p-chlorobenzyl alcohol were selected to investigate the photocatalytic performance of Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample. As listed in Table 1 , it is obvious that under irradiation for 2 h, the yields of Schiff base produced in the aromatic alcohol system of different substituents are 31.7, 36.8 and 12.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the yields of aromatic aldehydes are 86.6, 86.2 and 56.3%, and the yields of aniline are 35.0, 32.2 and 24.1%, respectively (Table 1, entries 1–3). Itisnoteworthy that when the substituent groups are OCH3 and -H, the yields of Schiff bases and aromatic aldehydes produced in the system are general the same. However, when the substituent group is -Cl, the yields of Schiff base and aldehyde are poor. In our previous reports, it was found that the yields of aromatic aldehydes with substituent groups of electron-donating (OCH3, CH3) was high than those of the electron-withdrawing group (Cl, F), which also explained the above results [24,38–41]. At the same time, the para-, meta-, and ortho-chloro-substituted benzyl alcohol as substrates were also investigated. The result reveals that the yields of Schiff bases are 12.3, 22.2 and 32.5%, respectively, which gradually increase as following: para- < meta- < ortho-. Thus it can be seen that the ortho-chlorobenzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene as substrates may be favorable for the formation of Schiff base (Table 1, entries 3–5). According to the reaction equations, we know that the theoretical yield of benzaldehyde should include one third of the amount of Schiff base compound, and the theoretical yield of aniline should contain equal amount of Schiff base compound. Thus, the theoretical yields of aromatic aldehydes produced in the system are 60.4 (56.3 + 12.3/3), 67.5 (60.1 + 22.2/3) and 67.3 (56.5 + 32.5/3)%, respectively. In addition, we also find that the benzaldehyde yields of ortho-, meta- and para-chloro-substituted benzyl alcohol follows the order: para- < ortho- < meta-. The yields of the aniline produced in the reaction system are 24.1, 23.2 and 3.5%, respectively. And the theoretical yields of aniline are 36.4, 45.4 and 36.0%, respectively. Hence, it is concluded that the yields of Schiff base produced in the reaction system are difference with different substitution positions, which may be attributed to the effect of steric hindrance and natural of the substrates. As is well known, the stability of a catalyst plays an important role in its assessment and industrial applications. Thus, in order to investigate the stability of Cd0.78Zn0.22S samples, the cyclic experiments were implemented by prolonging the irradiation time under the same reaction conditions. After each experiment, the solid photocatalyst was collected from the reaction solution by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, washed by absolute ethyl alcohol for 4 times, and then dried at 80 °C for 4 h. The results are shown in Fig. S4. It is noted that the yields of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base are not obvious changed for the first and second times. However, for the third time, the yields of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base exhibit a slight deactivation. It may be due to the loss of a small amount of photocatalyst during the recycling process. Compared with the third time experiment, the catalyst has no apparent deactivation in the fourth and fifth experiments. Based on the results, it is demonstrated that the Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample has high photo-stability in the reaction system. Moreover, the structural properties of the photocatalyst before and after five cycles investigated by XRD show no noticeable change (Fig. S5). Fig. 9 presents the wavelength dependence of the quantum efficiency (QE) on the formation of aniline, which is used to reflect the photocatalytic performance of the CdXZn1−XS samples. The quantum efficiencies of the catalyst with different wavelengths are determined according to the previous report [42]. Herein, we describe the QE determination at λ = 450 nm for Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample. The detail procedure is presented as following: The catalyst (0.1 g) solution was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp with a λ = 450 ± 10 nm band-pass filter for 2 h. The irradiation area is 10.2 cm2 and the average light intensity is ca. 5.56 mW cm−2 by a CEL-NP2000 spectroradiometer (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd). The photon number (N) of incident light is about N = 0.83 × 1021 (Eq. (1)). Aniline produced from nitrobenzene in the reaction for 2 h is 40.8 × 10−6 mol. Because the photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline is a 6-electron reduction reaction, the calculated QE of the sample with λ = 450 ± 10 nm is 15.8% (Eq. (2)). The other QE with different wavelengths are measured and presented in Fig. 9. It is clear that the QE gradually decreases with the increase the incident wavelength, and the QE of aniline yield over Cd0.78Zn0.22S matches well with the UV/vis absorption spectrum, suggesting the reaction indeed proceeds via photoabsorption by the catalyst. (7) N = E λ hc = 5.56 × 10 - 3 × 10.20 × 3600 × 2 × 450 × 10 - 9 6.626 × 10 - 34 × 3 × 10 8 = 0.83 × 10 21 (8) QE = 6 × number of electrons involved in the reaction number of incident photons = 6 × 6.02 × 10 23 × 40.8 × 10 - 6 0.83 × 10 21 = 15.8 %"
9,(Photo)electrochemicalanalysis,"3.3 (Photo)electrochemicalanalysis The above results indicate that CdXZn1−XS (0 ≤ X≤1) samples have the different photocatalytic performance. In order to further understand and explore the reason, a series of (photo)electrochemical experiments were performed. Fig. 10 a shows the results of the transient photocurrent response of CdXZn1−XS samples under visible light irradiation. It can be seen that Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample exhibits the largest photocurrent density among the all samples. As we know, the photocurrent intensity is closely related to the number of photogenerated electrons. In general, the holes are captured by the holes acceptor in the electrolyte, and the photogenerated electrons are collected to form photocurrent. Therefore, it can be concluded that Cd0.78Zn0.22S produces more photoinduced electron-hole pairs, and the lifetime of the photogenerated electron is longer than those of other samples. This result is also supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments. As shown in Fig. 10b, Nyquist plots of the CdXZn1−XS electrode materials were conducted in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution containing 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]-K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1). It can be found that the EIS spectra are displayed by the radii of different arcs at high frequencies. It is known that a smaller radius of the arc in the EIS Nyquist plots corresponds to a smaller resistance value of the electrodes, which can facilitate the separation and transfer of the photogenerated carriers. Because Cd0.78Zn0.22S exhibits a smaller EIS spectral arc, the sample has a higher photocatalytic activity. In order to further determine the VB and CB positions of the samples, the flat band potentials of the as-synthesized samples are measured by Mott-Schottky experiments, as displayed in Fig. S6. These Mott-Schottky plots have a unique feature that they are all positive slope, which is in agreement with the characteristics of n-type semiconductors. The flat band potential position is calculated according to the X intercepts of the linear region. The Vfb of CdXZn1−XS (X = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1) samples are −0.58, −0.80, −0.82, −0.85, −0.89, −0.91 and −0.93 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted that the bottom of the CB is more negative by ∼−0.1 V than the flat band potential for many n-type semiconductors, and the converted potential of Ag/AgCl vs. NHE is 0.20 V. So the CB values of the samples are −0.48, −0.70, −0.72, −0.75, −0.79, −0.81 and −0.83 V vs. NHE, respectively. From Fig. 3b, it indicates that the band gaps of CdXZn1−XS are 3.0, 2.2, 2.18, 2.15, 2.10, 1.97 and 1.95 eV, respectively. Therefore, the values of VB are 2.52, 1.5, 1.46, 1.4, 1.31, 1.16 and 1.12 eV, respectively. It is noteworthy that the VB values obtained from the experiments are different from those obtained from the theoretical calculation, which is mainly caused by different methods. From our previous reports [25,26], we know that the oxidation potential for benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is ca. +0.68 V (vs. NHE), and the reduction potential of nitrobenzene to aniline is −0.49 V (vs. NHE). Thus, it can be observed from Table 2 that the CdXZn1−XS samples are capable of realizing the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline except ZnS, which is accordance with the above experimental results."
10,Reaction mechanism,"3.4 Reaction mechanism Itisknownthat photoexcited electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are the major active species in the experimental conditions (N2 atmosphere) [24–26]. In order to verify the effects of photogenerated holes (h+) and electrons (e−) on the selective photocatalytic synthesis of Schiff base in the coupled system of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene, the control experiments were carried out. In this study, triethanolamine (TEA) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) are introduced as quenchers of photogenerated h+ and e−, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11 , it can be observed that when 5 μL TEA is added into the reaction system, the yield of benzaldehyde, aniline and Schiff base are reduced obviously from 86.6% to 37.3%, 14.8% to 4.4% and 36.8% to 3.0%, respectively. When CCl4 is added into the reaction system, the yields of Schiff bass and aniline were evidently reduced from 36.8% to 18.1% and 14.8% to 5.8%, respectively. However, the yield of benzaldehyde has a little increase from 86.6% to 90.0%. Therefore, it is concluded that photogenerated h+ and e− play significant roles in the formation of Schiff base, and the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to generate benzaldehyde is prior to the photocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. Based on the aforementioned results, it is confirmed that the photogenerated electrons and holes are primary active species for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline in the reaction system. Photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is a 2-hole oxidation reaction, and the photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline is a 6-electron reduction reaction. Subsequently, 1 mol Schiff base is produced by a condensation reaction of 1 mol aromatic aldehyde and 1 mol aniline. The detail reaction mechanism for the production of Schiff base by CdXZn1−XS under visible light is proposed in Scheme 1 . Firstly, CdXZn1−XS photocatalyst is excited under visible light irradiation and produce plenty of photogenerated carriers. The photoinduced electrons transfer from the VB to the CB, leaving holes in the VB of CdXZn1−XS. Secondly, the photogenerated holes with a moderate oxidation potential, can oxidize the adsorbed benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde and release H+. Subsequently, nitrobenzene is reduced by the photogenerated electrons to generate aniline in the presence of H+. Finally, benzaldehyde further reacts with aniline to synthesize Schiff base compound, releasing water. In order to determine the transfer process of hydrogen, an isotopic tracing experiment with benzyl-α, α-d2 alcohol (Ph-CD2OH) and nitrobenzene as substrates is carried out (Fig. S7). The results suggest that the products are PhCDO and PhNCDPh, respectively. Further research on the intermediate products reveals that the hydrogen source of aniline is derived from the hydroxyl hydrogen rather than the α-H of benzyl alcohol. It indicates that the released hydrogens for the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde are α-H and hydroxyl hydrogen of benzyl alcohol, respectively, and the hydrogen of Schiff base (N-benzylideneaniline) is originated from benzaldehyde. Thus, it is clarified that the obtained imine compound, i.e., PhNCHPh, is indeed synthesized from benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene in the reaction system."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, a series of CdXZn1−XS photocatalysts were prepared by a wet-chemical method at room temperature. The prepared Cd0.78Zn0.22S sample exhibits the best photocatalytic performance and stability for the selective photocatalytic synthesis of Schiff bases in a coupled system of aromatic alcohol and nitrobenzene under N2 and visible light irradiation. Photoexcited electrons and holes are the main active species in the reaction system. Aromatic alcohols were photocatalytically dehydrogenated (deprotonation) into aromatic aldehydes by photogenerated holes, and aniline can be produced from nitrobenzene by hydrogenation (hydrogenolysis) with the photogenerated electrons. This work achieves one-pot synthesis of Schiff base compounds by a photocatalytic reaction in a coupled system of aromatic alcohols and nitrobenzene over CdXZn1−XS under visible light illumination. We hope that our work can provide an effective pathway for the synthesis and transformation of organics by photocatalysis."
