0,Introduction,"The conversion of biomass resources is significantly important for human society considering the sustainable supplies of energy and materials [1–3]. Catalytic conversion is a common route for obtaining useful chemicals from biomass with the advantages of relatively mild reaction conditions and high product selectivity [4–6]. The biomass raw materials can be converted into various chemicals, including furfural, alcohols, short chain hydrocarbons, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid and its esters, etc [7–10]. The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl or aldehyde groups into respective alcohol compounds is a common step during the reaction chain from biomass to target products [11–14]. Various metal catalysts have been reported to be highly effective for the selective hydrogenation of carbonyl or aldehyde groups (CO, CHO) into alcohols (C-OH) while maintaining the carbon-carbon double bonds (CC) not reduced, such as Zn- [13], Fe- [14,15], Co [16], bimetallic Ni-Cu- [17], and Zr-based catalysts [12], etc. Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction is commonly used for the conversion of carbonyl compounds via selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bonds, leaving the CC double bonds intact [11,12]. Zr-based catalysts were commonly used due to the high efficiency for the MPV reaction, such as ZrO2 [18,19], Zr-containing zeolites [20], Zr alkoxides [21], Zr(OH)4 [22], and zirconium phosphates [23,24], etc. In order to further improve the activity of the Zr-based catalysts, decrease the usage of the Zr elements, and/or make the reaction conditions milder, different organic or inorganic ligands were cooperated with Zr species to construct composite catalysts. Some chemicals with functional groups were applied in the synthesis of novel and composite catalysts, such as phosphate [23], 4-hydroxybenzoic acid dipotassium salt [25], cyanuric acid [26], benzenetricarboxylic acid and its analogue [27], etc. In our recent work, a more abundant and cheap material, natural phytic acid containing six phosphate acid groups, was reported to be efficient in constructing Zr-based catalyst [12]. For the composite catalysts, the costs of the catalysts generally depend on the active metals (Zr in this case), the functional ligands, and the preparing process of catalysts. From viewpoint of cutting the catalyst costs, exploring more available and low-cost raw materials and simplifying the preparing processes are undoubtedly meaningful for promoting the applications of Zr-based catalysts in the field of biomass conversion. Coal is the important fossil sources, providing human energy, chemicals and materials [28]. Due to the limited reserves of coals and, especially, the fast depletion of the high rank coal, efficient utilization of the low rank coal is drawing more and more attentions around the world [29,30]. Lignite is an important and typical representative among the low rank coal family [31]. Due to the drawbacks of high contents of water and oxygen-containing components, low caloric value, and instability in chemical properties, etc, lignite is not suitable for direct use as energy sources [29,31,32]. Therefore, exploring novel and value-added approaches of using lignite becomes an inevitable choice for the utilization and conversion of lignite and other low rank coals. Typical and traditional processes have been proposed and studied extensively to improve the utilization efficiency of lignite. Drying and pyrolysis process can remove the water and volatile components in lignite, and improve the quality of the obtained chars [33–35]. Through water or CO2 gasification processes, valuable gaseous products, including H2, CO and/or CH4, etc., can be produced from lignite [36–39]. Liquefaction is also used to degrade the low rank coals and obtain useful chemicals [40]. Due to the main component of lignite is the carbon element, lignite can be converted into stable carbon-based materials via treatment under high temperatures. Therefore, preparing carbon supported metal catalysts using lignite as raw materials through high temperature treatment is another approach for lignite utilization [41–43]. Compared with direct combustion, these approaches can improve the added values of the lignite derived products in some extent. However, it is worth considering that these approaches are often fulfilled under extreme conditions (especially high temperatures), which destroys the natural composition of lignite and/or leads to the waste of carbon in volatile components. Therefore, how to utilize lignite especially based on its specific composition and structure properties is a critical issue for exploring value-added utilization approach of lignite. In order to improve the added values during the utilization of lignite, some new utilizing routes were proposed. For example, the recently emerging researches on obtaining valuable chemicals (especially carboxylic acids and polycyclic aromatic compounds) from lignite via degradation under mild conditions are attractive and promising approaches for lignite utilization, which sheds light on the value-added utilization of the low rank coals [29,31,44–46]. Undeniably, this route faces the tough issue of product separation and purification from the degraded mixtures. Very recently, we reported that humic acids extracted from lignite could be used for the preparation of Zr-based catalysts, which gave high efficiency for the conversion of various carbonyl compounds [47,48]. Furthermore, we identified that both the humic acid components extracted from lignite and the corresponding solid residues after extraction were applicable in constructing Zr-based catalysts [49]. It is well-known that lignite contains abundant acidic functional groups and specific natural pore structures, which might be potentially applied in the construction of metal catalysts based on the interaction of acidic groups with metal ions. However, as far as we know, there have been few attempts concerning the topic of using lignite directly under mild conditions to construct metal catalysts. In this work, we designed a novel and facile route of directly using raw lignite as robust organic ligands to construct Zr-based catalysts aiming to utilize the abundant oxygen-containing acidic functional groups in lignite without harsh pretreatment and huge destruction of natural structures of lignite. The selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived carbonyl compounds into alcohols was used as the model reaction to evaluate the performances of the catalysts (Scheme 1 ). The structures of the catalysts were characterized in detail, and both the preparation conditions of the catalysts and the reaction parameters were systematically investigated. After these, different coals with various coal ranks were attempted to check the universality of the proposed route, and various carbonyl substrates with different structures were investigated to see the substrate applicability. The results verified that the proposed route was feasible for different low rank coals (lignite, long flame coal, and coking coal), and the constructed catalyst using lignite as raw materials were efficient for the conversion of carbonyl and aldehyde compounds with different structures. The novel route proposed in this work may be promising in applications with the advantages of high efficiency of the catalysts, low cost of raw materials, and simple preparing process."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural (98%), hexanaldehyde (>95%), 2-hexanone (98%), cyclohexanone (99%), ethyl levulinate (98%), isopropanol (AR), and ZrOCl2·8H2O (AR) were provided by J&K Scientific Ltd. Ethanol (AR), NaOH (AR), decane (AR) and other chemicals were obtained from Beijing Institute of Chemical Reagent. The raw lignite sample was collected from Shengli coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China, and was denoted as raw Shengli lignite (RSL). Coking coal was collected from Ovoot Tolgoi Coalfield, Mongolia. Long flame coal and Taixi coal were collected from Xinjiang Chuomaohu Coalfield and Ningxia Taixi Coalfield, China, respectively. The as-received coal sample was crushed and ground to fine powder with average sizes ca. 38–75 μm, followed by drying at 105 °C in air for 12 h."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts The detailed preparing procedures of the catalyst were similar as our previous reports [47,48]. As seen in Scheme 1, two different routes were attempted to investigate the effects of the inherent minerals, one using raw lignite and the other using HCl demineralized lignite as raw materials. The preparing procedures were similar, and typically described as followings. For route 1, the raw Shengli lignite (RSL) powder (1 g) was treated and well dispersed in 50 mL diluted NaOH solution (0.1 mol/L), and the slurry was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h. After cooling down, the pH value of the solution was tuned by chloride acid solution to pH ≈ 2–3, and the mixture was maintained under this condition for 1 h. The obtained slurry was mixed with 50 mL Zr precursor solution containing 1.00 g ZrOCl2·8H2O, and the system was allowed to react under stirring at 80 °C for 5 h. Finally, the suspended solution was separated by filtering under vacuum to give black precipitate. The catalysts were obtained after the precipitate was thoroughly washed for at least 5 times with distilled water and then ethanol until no Cl- was detected by AgNO3 solution, dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h, and crowded into powders for use (denoted as Zr-RSL). For route 2, raw Shengli lignite (RSL) was replaced by demineralized Shengli lignite (DSL), and other procedures were similar. The demineralization processes were described in detail in our earlier report [36]. The obtained catalysts for route 2 were denoted as Zr-DSL. Different dosages of Zr precursor were attempted for both the catalysts with different mass ratios of Zr precursor (ZrOCl2·8H2O) to RSL or DSL from 0.05:1 to 11:1, and the activities and Zr contents of the obtained catalysts were detected. The catalysts using other coal samples as raw materials were prepared similar as route 2."
4,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of the catalysts Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement was performed on a Hitachi S-3400 N scanning electron microscope operated at 20 kV with Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) apparatus. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a XD8 Advance-Bruker AXS X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 532 nm) and Ni filter scanning at 2° per minute ranging 5°–80°. The tube voltage was 40 kV and the current was 40 mA. The Zr contents were detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS, Jena ZEEnit® 700P, German). Fourier transform-infrared spectra (FTIR) were obtained using a PerkinElmer Spectrum. Raman spectrum was collected on a Renishaw® inVia microscope in the range of 200 cm−1 to 2500 cm−1 on 5 different points with 532 nm laser for excitation with power of 1.5 mW, 50× objective, data acquisition time 1 s, and scanning 50 cycles for each spectrum. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of Zr-RSL was performed on a thermogravimetric analysis system (Diamond TG/DTA6300, PerkinElmer Instruments) under Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1."
5,Reaction,"2.4 Reaction The catalytic conversion of furfural into furfuryl alcohol (FAL) was performed in a 10 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Typically, furfural (1 mmol), isopropanol (5 mL), and a certain amount of the catalyst were introduced into the reactor. After sealing, the reaction mixture was stirred and allowed to react at suitable temperatures for a desired period. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down in cold water to quench the reaction and the reaction solution was transferred and diluted by isopropanol. The samples were analyzed quantitatively by gas chromatography (TECHCOMP GC7900) with a flame ionization detector using decane as the internal standard. Identification of the products and the reactants was done using a GC-MS (SHIMADZU-QP 2010) as well as by comparing the retention times with respective standards in GC traces. The reusability and heterogeneity of catalysts were detected as follows. After the first use, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation, washed with fresh isopropanol for three times, and then directly reused for the next run. The heterogeneity of the catalyst was detected by removing the solid catalyst from the reaction mixture, and the supernatant was maintained under the same reaction conditions to see if the conversion and yield could further increase without the presence of the solid catalyst."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Studies of the preparation conditions of catalysts,"3.1 Studies of the preparation conditions of catalysts The research was started with the comparison of the two different preparation routes and effects of the Zr precursor dosages, and the structure parameters and performances of the catalysts were shown in Table 1 . For route 1 (Table 1, Entries 1–6), RSL was directly used as raw materials to prepare Zr-based catalysts, and the Zr contents in the catalysts generally increased with the increasing of the precursor ratios from 0.05:1 to 2:1. Further increasing the precursor dosage made the Zr content decrease slightly (Table 1, Entries 6), which might be due to that the interaction of Zr4+ with the acidic groups in RSL was inhibited by the increasingly strong acidic environment under high Zr precursor dosage. The specific area of the catalysts showed an increasing trend with the increasing of the precursor dosage. Similar trend could also be observed for the conversion, yield, and TON values. Among the Zr-RSL catalysts studied, Zr-RSL(1:1) gave the best performance with the highest conversion, yield, and TON value. To compare with route 1, raw lignite was firstly treated by HCl demineralization to and then used as raw materials to prepare Zr-DSL catalysts (route 2, Entries 7–10). Under identical Zr precursor dosages (Table 1, Entries 3, 4, 7, and 8), the Zr content in Zr-DSL catalysts were much higher than that in Zr-RSL, probably due to that the inherent minerals occupied the acidic groups in RSL and made the effective interaction sites decreased. While for DSL, inherent minerals were removed and more acidic groups were exposed to interact with Zr4+, leading to high Zr content in the obtained catalysts. Similar with Zr-RSL, the Zr content in Zr-DSL decreased under higher Zr precursor dosage. Zr-DSL(1:1) performed better than other Zr-DSL catalysts in view of conversion, yield, and TON value. Through the comparison of route 1 and route 2, it can be seen that both catalysts prepared by the two routes were efficient for the conversion of furfural, and Zr-RSL catalyst generally gave higher conversion, yield, and TON value. On the other hand, the process of HCl demineralization was avoided in route 1, which could be helpful for simplifying the preparation processes of the catalysts and decreasing the production of acidic wastewater. Therefore, Zr-RSL(1:1) was chosen as a target catalyst for further studies."
8,Structure characterizations of the catalyst,"3.2 Structure characterizations of the catalyst The morphology of RSL and the corresponding catalyst prepared at the RSL:Zr precursor mass ratio of 1:1 was characterized by SEM (Fig. 1 a, b). The microstructures of both RSL and the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst were composed of irregular particles with varied sizes. After the NaOH treatment during the catalyst preparation, the surface structures of the particles had a slight change, with the appearance of some small particles (inserted figures in Fig. 1a, b). This might be caused by the partial degradation effect of NaOH treatment on the RSL, resulting in the sizes of the raw coal becoming smaller and producing some molecules with smaller molecular weights. These small molecules interacted with Zr4+ via the acidic oxygen-containing functional groups, and formed the smaller particles. EDS characterization showed that there was no Zr in the composition of RSL, while the strong Zr signal was observed in Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst (Fig. 1c, d). These results showed that Zr element was successfully introduced into the catalyst. The Zr content in Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst was estimated to be approximately 6.7 wt% by the EDS mapping and AAS analysis. Powder XRD was conducted to characterize the crystal structures of RSL and the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst. From Fig. 2 , it was found that RSL had obvious diffraction peaks at around 21° and 27°, corresponding to SiO2 in raw lignite [36]. The SiO2 peaks became much weaker in Zr-RSL(1:1), which was caused by the NaOH pretreatment during the catalyst preparation process. Both RSL and Zr-RSL showed broad diffraction band within the 2θ region of 20—30° and high background intensity, indicating that these samples had some graphite-like structures (crystalline carbon) and a large proportion of highly disordered materials in the form of amorphous carbon [50,51]. Compared with RSL, the main structures of Zr-RSL(1:1) had no obvious change after the introduction of Zr4+. The FTIR and Raman spectra of RSL and the corresponding Zr-RSL catalyst were shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3(a), the FTIR spectrum of RSL displayed the characteristic asymmetric (1698 cm−1, 1585 cm−1) and symmetric vibrations (1431 cm−1, 1373 cm−1) of carboxylate anions coordinated with the inherent mineral ions [25]. For the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst, the characteristic peaks of carboxylate groups became more obvious, and the peak positions had slight changes, i.e., asymmetric vibrations (1695 cm−1, 1639 cm−1) and symmetric vibrations (1455 cm−1, 1395 cm−1) as indicated in Fig. 3a. The wavenumber difference of asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of carboxylate anions was broadened from 212 cm−1 for RSL to 244 cm−1 for Zr-RSL(1:1). These results showed that the inherent metal ions in RSL were partially removed by the NaOH pretreatment and partial carboxylate groups existed in the form of carboxylate acid groups in Zr-RSL(1:1) due to the acidic environment resulted from the Zr precursor solution [25,52]. New peaks appeared at 1547 and 1518 cm−1 in the spectrum of Zr-RSL(1:1), indicating that Zr4+ was introduced via interacting with the carboxylate anions groups [47,48]. The peak at around 1040 cm−1 corresponding to Si-O bonds became weaker from RSL to Zr-RSL(1:1), indicating that the silicate minerals were partially removed during the catalyst preparation process [53]. The carbon skeleton structures of raw lignite and Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst were characterized by Raman spectra (Fig. 3b). Two typical peaks at approximately 1366 cm−1 and 1587 cm−1 were observed, which could be attributed to the disordered carbon band (D band) and the graphite band (G band) in samples, respectively [36]. The relative intensity of D band to G band (ID/IG) of raw lignite and Zr-RSL(1:1) were 0.73 and 0.69, respectively. The slight decreasing in ID/IG for Zr-RSL(1:1) may be resulted from the solvent washing during the preparation of the catalyst, leading to the content of some relatively small molecules with disordered carbon structures decreasing and giving weaker D band intensity. Overall, the introduction of Zr species had no significant effects on the carbon structures of raw lignite. The thermal stability of RSL and the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst were compared via TG characterization (Fig. 4 ). Under the temperature range below 180 °C, the weight losses were 4% and 6% for Zr-RSL(1:1) and RSL, respectively, which could be assigned to the desorption of water and ethanol adsorbed on the catalyst during the preparation processes [52]. The weight loss stage from ca. 200 °C to ca. 400 °C could be resulted from the decomposition of side chains and the small molecules in RSL and Zr-RSL, while the weight loss stage after 400 °C could be due to the pyrolysis of the carbon skeleton structures [47]. Throughout the whole heating process, the mass loss of Zr-RSL(1:1) under the same temperature was slightly less than that of RSL, and the final mass losses of RSL and Zr-RSL were 43% and 38%, respectively. These results indicated that the as-prepared catalyst had a good tolerability to high temperatures and was stable enough under the reaction temperatures (below 200 °C)."
9,Effect of the catalyst dosage,"3.3 Effect of the catalyst dosage The effects of different experimental factors on the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst were investigated. Fig. 5 showed that the effect of catalyst dosage on the conversion of furfural into FAL. Under the low catalyst dosage range, both the conversion and the yield increased obviously with the increasing of the catalyst dosage. When the catalyst dosage exceeded 0.2 g under the studied conditions, the increasing of the conversion and the yield became not significant. Furthermore, high catalyst dosage made the reaction slurry thick, which was not conducive to reaction process and post-treatment after reaction. Therefore, 0.2 g was chosen as a suitable dosage under the present conditions, and the conversion, product yield, and selectivity were 86.1%, 68.4%, and 79.5%, respectively, at this dosage level."
10,Influence of the reaction temperature,"3.4 Influence of the reaction temperature The effect of reaction temperature on the performance of Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst was studied (Fig. 6 ). The conversion and yield increased significantly with the increasing of the reaction temperature before 90 °C. The conversion, yield, and selectivity came to 93.4%, 80.9%, and 86.7%, respectively, at the temperature of 90 °C. The increasing rate of the conversion, yield, and selectivity became slower with further enhancing the reaction temperature. Considering both the energy input during the reaction and the reaction rate, 90 °C was chosen as the suitable reaction temperature for the catalyst under the studied conditions."
11,Influence of the reaction time,"3.5 Influence of the reaction time The reaction result profiles of the Zr-RSL catalyst with the reaction time were given in Fig. 7 . The results showed that the product yield increased obviously with the prolonging of the reaction time. The conversion, yield, and selectivity came to 93.4%, 80.9%, and 86.7% at the reaction time of 6 h under the present reaction conditions. Further prolonging the reaction could fulfill the nearly total conversion of the substrate, while the product yield decreased slightly. Several weak and unknown peaks appeared in the GC profiles, and the reaction solution was analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS results showed that no obvious byproducts were detected, which may be due to that the concentration of the soluble byproducts was extremely low, and most of the byproducts were insoluble due to polymerization reaction of the furfural or FAL molecules in the solvents. As shown in the later Fig. 9f, TG comparison analysis of the fresh and recycled catalysts showed that the weight loss of the recycled catalysts (30.6%) around 600 °C was slightly larger than that of the fresh catalyst (29.4%), indicating that the insoluble byproducts may be formed and absorbed on the catalyst."
12,Reusability and heterogeneity of the catalyst,"3.6 Reusability and heterogeneity of the catalyst The reusability of the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst was investigated via controlling the conversion around 50% level (Fig. 8 ). The results showed that the catalyst could be reused, but the conversion and yield decreased gradually with the increasing of the recycling times. The conversion and yield decreased from 56.3% and 48.3% in the first use to 31.5% and 21.6% in the 5th use, respectively. In the experiment, it was found that the loss of the catalyst occurred during recycling via centrifugation, which could cause the decreasing in the performance (Fig. 8a). Thus after the 5th use, fresh catalyst was added to compensate for the loss of the catalyst (6th use in Fig. 8a). Indeed, both the conversion and yield returned to 45.2% and 35.3%, respectively, nearly the same level to the 2nd use, which proved that catalyst loss was an important reason causing the decreasing in catalyst performance. It also should be noted that the conversion and yield were still 11.1% and 13.0%, respectively, lower than those of the first use even after the addition of fresh catalyst, indicating that there might be other factors influencing the reusability. Heterogeneity experiment was conducted to see if it is the active species leaching to cause the decreasing in activity (Fig. 8b). The results showed that the yield had no further increasing after the removing of the solid catalyst, indicating that the active species did not dissolve into the solvent. The results also confirmed that it was the heterogeneous catalyst to catalyze the reaction. Furthermore, the fresh and recycled catalysts were characterized by EDS mapping and AAS mapping, and the results showed that the Zr contents in the two samples were both around 6.4 wt%, indicating that no significant leaching of Zr element occurred. Therefore, the structures of the fresh and recycled Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst were also characterized and compared to see if there were any significant change in structures after repeated uses (Fig. 9 ). From SEM characterization (Fig. 9a, b), both of the fresh and recycled catalysts were composed of irregular particles, and no obvious morphology changes were observed except that the particle sizes seemed to become larger. From XRD and FTIR results (Fig. 9c, d), the main structures of the catalyst had no considerable changes after use. The fresh and recycled catalysts showed similar Raman spectra, indicating that the carbon skeleton structure of the catalyst had no obvious change (Fig. 9e). TG comparison analysis of the fresh and recycled catalysts showed that the weight loss of the recycled catalysts (30.6%) around 600 °C was slightly larger than that of the fresh catalyst (29.4%) (Fig. 9f). This result might indicate that some byproducts were absorbed on the catalyst, which could also cause the decreasing of the performance. To improve the stability of the microstructures of the catalyst, fresh Zr-RSL(1:1) was attempted to be pretreated under 400 °C and N2 atomosphere for 3 h to strengthen the interaction of Zr species with lignite, and the reusability was shown in Fig. 8c. After pretreatment, the activity of the catalysts decreased, needing a longer time (5 h) to fulfil similar catalytic results as Zr-RSL(1:1) without pretreatment (2 h). But the stability of the catalyst was indeed improved in some extent, with conversion and yield decreased from 63.1% and 52.5% to 40.1% and 26.5%, respectively, which was slightly better than those of Zr-RSL(1:1) without pretreatment. The conversion almost maintained the same level after the first use. These results indicated that the stability of the microstructures had also influences on the reusability. Due to the raw lignite was used during the preparation of Zr-RSL(1:1), and thus it was postulated that if it was the inherent minerals influencing the reusability. Therefore, the reusability of Zr-DSL(1:1) with HCl demineralized lignite as raw materials during preparation was studied (Fig. 8d). Interestingly, the reusability of Zr-DSL(1:1) was excellent with no decreasing in performance. The above results proved that the catalyst loss during recycling mainly contributed to the decreasing in performance of Zr-RSL(1:1), and the stability of the microstructures and the inherent minerals had also effects on the reusability. The reusability of Zr-RSL(1:1) was satisfied when the catalyst loss could be avoided as much as possible during potential applications. It was worth noting that although no critical and thermal pretreatment of lignite was conducted before catalyst preparation, no obvious impurities from lignite were detected during GC analysis and the satisfied reusability was obtained. The reason for this may be that washing processes with different solvents were conducted after the catalyst was formed and the small molecules without combining with Zr4+ in coal could be removed. Another possible reason for the stability was that the addition of Zr4+ combining the macromolecules in coal together and formed stable network structures. After the above optimization, the performance of the prepared catalyst was compared with those of the typical catalysts in literatures, including noble and transition metal-based catalysts (Table 2 ). For the chemoselective conversion of furfural to FAL, two routes are usually reported, including catalytic transfer hydrogenation using secondary alcohol or formic acid as hydrogen source and direct hydrogenation using H2 as hydrogen source. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts (typically Zr-based catalysts) and other noble or transition metal catalysts were often applied in the two routes, respectively. Therefore, the performance of the catalysts was compared with the two kinds of catalysts. From Table 2, the prepared Zr-RSL(1:1) catalysts showed nearly similar level conversion and product selectivity under comparable reaction conditions but with a higher TOF value among the typical Zr-catalysts (Table 2, Entries 1–6). For other catalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts (such as Fe, Ni, Mg, Entries 7–10), higher temperatures were often needed to achieve similar conversion and yield. Different from the catalytic transfer hydrogenation route, the hydrogenation using H2 as hydrogen source was often operated under higher gas pressure, among which noble metal catalysts generally showed higher efficiency with higher TOF values than transition metal catalysts under milder reaction conditions (Entries 11–18). Compared with the transition metal catalysts using H2 as hydrogen, the reaction conditions of the prepared Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst were milder but with similar reaction results. From the viewpoint of the reaction conditions, the cost of raw materials, and the convenience of the preparation process, the Zr-RSL catalysts constructed in this work had obvious advantages as compared to the noble and other transition metal catalysts."
13,Attempts in other coals with different ranks,"3.7 Attempts in other coals with different ranks Encouraged by the satisfied performance of the Zr-RSL and Zr-DSL catalysts constructed using lignite as raw materials, we explored the possibility of applying the same route in other coals with different ranks. Some typical coals, including lignite (Shengli lignite), subbituminous coal (long flame coal), bitumite (coking coal), and anthracite (Taixi coal), were compared as shown in Table 3 . Due to the complexity of the coal structures, many factors could affect the performances of the obtained catalysts, such as the surface area and the oxygen-containing groups, which could finally influence the Zr contents in the catalysts. We analyzed the BET of the catalysts prepared by different coals and the Zr contents in the catalysts (Table 3). The results showed that both the Zr contents and surface area of the catalysts prepared through identical route and conditions decreased sharply with the increasing of the coal ranks from lignite to bitumite and anthracite. The contents of humic components containing acidic oxygen-containing groups in the coals decreased with the increasing of the coal ranks, leading to the interaction sites with Zr4+ decreased and thus the Zr contents decreased. For lignite, both Zr-RSL and Zr-DSL were efficient for the conversion of furfural, and Zr-DSL even performed better under a lower temperature (70 °C) than that under a higher temperature (90 °C) via prolonging the reaction time (Entries 1–3). Long flame coal performed as well as lignite, with similar level of conversion, yield, selectivity, and TON value. For coals with higher ranks (coking coal and Taixi coal), the performances of the catalysts were not as efficient as the low rank coals, with much lower conversion and selectivity, which may be due to the lower Zr contents and specific area. Improving the dosage of Zr-DCC and Zr-DTC catalysts during the reaction could make the reaction system thick under the present reaction conditions, which had negative effect in mass transfer. Therefore, the performances of the catalysts prepared by different coals were affected by both surface area and Zr contents of the catalysts. The proposed route is more suitable for constructing Zr-based catalysts using the low rank coals as raw materials compared with the high rank coals."
14,Conversion of different carbonyl compounds,"3.8 Conversion of different carbonyl compounds Besides the conversion of furfural into FAL, we also applied the designed catalyst into the conversion of other carbonyl compounds, including aldehyde and ketone compounds (Table 4 ). The results showed that the Zr-RSL(1:1) catalyst was also effective for the examined substrates. Comparatively, the aldehyde compounds (furfural and hexanaldehyde in this case, Table 4, entries 1–2) could be converted under lower temperatures with higher conversions and product yields, while the ketone compounds often needed higher temperatures (Entries 3–6). Among the ketone compounds studied, cyclohexanone could be converted under the mildest conditions, and other ketones, especially with long aliphatic chains, needed relatively harsh conditions to achieve similar reaction results with aldehydes (Table 4, entries 3–6). These results might be caused by the steric hindrance due to the larger structures of the substrates [12]. The mediate activity of the Zr-RSL catalyst for the diketone compounds (2,5-hexanedione in this case, Entry 6) was also observed with the conversion of 93.3% and total product yield of 58.0% (2,5-hexanediol, 35.6%; 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 22.4%) under not optimized conditions. These results showed that the designed Zr-RSL catalyst in this work was efficient for the conversion of carbonyl compounds with different structures."
15,Mechanism analysis,"3.9 Mechanism analysis According to the catalyst characterization results and previous reports [12,47,48], the possible mechanism of Zr-RSL catalytic conversion of carbonyl compounds was analyzed (Scheme 2 ). In Zr-RSL catalyst, Zr4+ and O2− (in carboxylate and/or phenate groups in lignite) acted as the Lewis acidic and basic sites essential for the MPV reaction, respectively [19,63,64]. Firstly, the substrate and isopropanol molecules were adsorbed onto the catalyst and interacted with the adjacent acid-base sites (Zr4+ O2−) in Zr-RSL, which led to the activation of carbonyl groups in substrates and the hydroxyl groups in isopropanol, respectively. After this, the hydrogen transfer happened between the activated substrate molecules and the dissociated alcohol via a concerted process involving a six-link intermediate to form the corresponding products. The carboxyl groups were converted into hydroxyl groups while isopropanol converted into acetone after the loss of two hydrogen atoms."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel route using the raw lignite to construct Zr-containing catalyst for the conversion of biomass-derived furfural and other carbonyl compounds was attempted and verified to be feasible. The mass ratio of the raw lignite to Zr precursor had important influences on the activities of the obtained catalyst, and the results showed that 1:1 was an optimal ratio. The performances of the catalyst were jointly influenced by both Zr contents and surface area of the catalyst. The furfural conversion, FAL yield, and the selectivity could reach 93.4%, 80.9%, and 86.7% under optimized conditions. The proposed route was identified to be applicable for different low rank coals, such as lignite, long flame coal, and coking coal, with high conversion and yield. The catalyst prepared using lignite was robustly effective for the conversion of various carbonyl compounds with different structures, indicating the broad universality for different substrates. This new strategy of constructing Zr-based catalysts may have potential applications in the value-added utilization of both low rank coal and the biomass resources, with the advantages of high efficiency of the catalysts, low cost of raw materials, and simple preparing process."
