0,Introduction,"Increasing sustainability demands are now placed on chemical production to improve catalytic selectivity and minimise by-product formation, circumvent separation/purification operations and avoid costly clean-up and disposal. This requires a fundamental understanding of reaction mechanisms and catalyst structure/performance relationships. Benzoic acid, the focus of this study, is an inexpensive feedstock [1] that can be hydrogenated to benzaldehyde [2] or benzyl alcohol [3,4] as important commercial products. Reaction over a range of oxide catalysts, including CeO2 [5–8], ZrO2 [1,7,9–11], MgO [7], ZnO [1,7,12], TiO2 [11], HfO2 [11] and MoO x [13,14], in gas-phase operation (1atm, 473–773K) has resulted in the formation of benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, toluene, benzene and benzophenone (Fig. 1 (A)). Infrared studies suggest dissociative adsorption to form a benzoate with coordination between the carboxylic oxygen(s) and cationic metal site(s) [10,15–18]. In the presence of surface oxygen vacancies, hydrogenation proceeds via a redox Mars and van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [1,7,8,11,19]. Interaction with isolated oxygen vacancies results in the removal of one oxygen from the carboxyl with the formation of benzaldehyde (step I, Fig. 1(A)) [18]. Surface hydrogen can react with this oxygen to form water, regenerating the active site [1,7]. In the presence of twin vacancies, benzoic acid adsorbs through both oxygens with reduction to produce toluene (step II) [20,21]. Toluene can also be generated on a surface that bears excess vacancies via consecutive reduction of benzaldehyde (step III) [22,23]. The steady-state concentration of oxygen vacancies controls selectivity via steps I–III [11] and is influenced by solvents/additives [1,11], but is largely determined by oxide reducibility where redox properties [22,23], metal–oxygen bond strength [11], H2 partial pressure [22] and activation conditions [6] are crucial variables. Reducible oxides (such as Co3O4) exhibit a high oxygen vacancy density and promote the generation of toluene [7,11] where use of solvents or additives with an affinity for these sites (e.g. CO2 or polar compounds such as water) favours benzaldehyde [1,11]. Adsorption on surfaces that do not bear vacancies is accompanied by scission of the acidic function [9,18,21] to give benzene (step IV) and/or benzophenone (step V). Decarboxylation of benzoic acid is favoured at high temperature (>673K) and low surface hydrogen coverage [1], but this step is slow relative to deoxygenation at vacancy sites (MvK mechanism) [22]. Benzene can also result from decarbonylation of benzaldehyde (step VI) [22] or hydrogenolysis of toluene (step VII) [18]. Hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol (step VIII) has been observed at temperatures<630K [7,8,12,22]. Activation of H2 via dissociative adsorption on oxides (such as ZrO2) has been shown to be rate determining [9]. While the incorporation of noble metals can facilitate hydrogen dissociation and influence reactivity, we could find only one report of (gas phase) benzoic acid hydrogenation over supported metals (Cu and Pt on ZrO2) where increased H2 uptake resulted in preferential hydrogenation (particularly in the case of Pt) of the aromatic ring with the formation of methyl-cyclohexane and cyclohexane-carboxylic acid [11]. Gold exhibits lower capacity for H2 adsorption relative to Pt [24–26] and has been used to promote selective CO hydrogenation in aldehydes [27–30] and ketones [31,32]. We have shown that supported Au can promote sole formation of benzyl alcohol in benzaldehyde reduction [33]. The literature dealing with benzyl alcohol generation from benzoic acid is limited, and the possibility of a direct hydrogenation (single step) has not been investigated in any detail. The facility for oxygen vacancy formation [6,34] and the amphoteric surface properties [18] of ZrO2 [1,7,9,10] and CeO2 [5,6,8] can serve to promote benzoic acid→benzaldehyde with secondary benzyl alcohol, toluene and benzene. The addition of a metal, such as Au, should favour hydrogenation (step VIII) due to increased surface hydrogen. Gold supported on CeO2 and Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 has exhibited activity in the hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene [35] and crotonaldehyde [28]. In this study, we consider the catalytic action of these systems in the hydrogenation of benzoic acid directed at the selective formation of benzyl alcohol where the role of reaction temperature and solvent carrier are examined."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Au/Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 (Au/CZ) and Au/CeO2 were prepared by deposition–precipitation. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (Alfa Aesar) served as precursor, and the oxide supports (CZ and CeO2) were obtained from Grace Davison. A known mass (15g) of support was added to 800cm3 deionised water; the suspension stirred and heated to 333K; the HAuCl4 solution (3.2mM) introduced at a fixed flow rate (3cm3 min−1); and pH adjusted to 8 with aqueous Na2CO3 (50mM). After ageing for 1h, the solution was cooled to ambient temperature, filtered, and the resultant solid washed with deionised water until there was no evidence of chloride ions and dried at 383K for 12h. The samples were calcined in 5% v/v O2/He at 523K, which was maintained for 1h with further contact (1h) in a He flow and subsequent cooling to 298K. The samples were sieved to 75μm mean particle diameter and stored in the dark under Ar. The Au content was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Vista-PRO, Varian Inc.) from the diluted extract in aqua regia."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation Total (BET) surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution were determined by volumetric N2 adsorption at 77K. Carbon monoxide adsorption has been investigated on both bare oxides and the corresponding supported Au catalysts, following the procedure given elsewhere [36]. Two volumetric isotherms at 308K (P CO =0–300Torr) separated by 30min evacuation (residual pressure<10−6 Torr) were successively recorded on each sample. By processing the experimental isotherm data as described in [37], contributions to the total CO adsorbed due to interaction with Au nanoparticles and strong (carbonate species) and weak (CO adsorption on the cationic sites) interaction with the support could be discriminated and quantified. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were determined using the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit. Samples were loaded into a U-shaped Quartz cell (10cm×3.76mm i.d.) and heated in 17cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5% v/v H2/N2 at 5Kmin−1 to 573K. The effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap, and changes in H2 consumption were monitored by TCD with data acquisition using the TPR Win™ software. The samples were maintained at the final temperature in a constant flow of H2/N2 until return of the signal to baseline, swept with 65cm3 min−1 N2 for 1.5h, cooled to ambient temperature, and subjected to TPD in N2 (65cm3 min−1) at 50Kmin−1 to 973K. Ammonia chemisorption by pulse (1ml) titration was also conducted with TPD in N2 (180cm3 min−1) at 10Kmin−1 to 873K. The degree of support reduction was assessed in terms of oxygen storage capacity (OSC) where the sample was reduced in 50cm3 min−1 H2 at 5Kmin−1 to 573K (1h), swept with 65cm3 min−1 He for 1.5h, cooled to 523K, and subjected to pulse (50μl) O2 titration. It has been demonstrated previously that there is a negligible contribution from Au to total O2 adsorbed [38], and the degree of Ce4+ reduction can be determined from O2 uptake. Powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Samples were scanned at 0.02°step−1 over the range 5°⩽2θ ⩽85°. Diffractograms were identified using the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards (CeO2 (43-1002), monoclinic (37-1484) or tetragonal (50-1089) ZrO2 and Au (04-0784)). The oxide crystal size (dhkl ) was estimated using the Scherrer equation (1) d hkl = K × λ β × cos θ where K =0.9, λ is the incident radiation wavelength (1.5056Å), β is the peak width at half the maximum intensity and θ represents the diffraction angle corresponding to the main plane of CeO2 and CZ (2θ =28.5–29.0°). Supported Au particle size distribution was measured by High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Images were recorded using a JEOL2010-F microscope with 0.19nm spatial resolution under Scherzer defocus conditions. HAADF-STEM images were obtained with an electron probe (0.5nm diameter) at a diffraction camera length of 10cm. This imaging mode provides contrast that is directly related to average atomic number (Z) in the region under the electron beam. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD unit equipped with a catalytic cell, allowing transfer of the pretreated samples under anaerobic conditions. Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ were reduced in a flow of H2 at 573K (1h), evacuated under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 473K (1h), cooled to 298K under UHV, and transferred to the analysis chamber. Spectra were recorded using monochromatised Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV) at an X-ray source power=150W. Surface charging effects were compensated using the Kratos coaxial neutralisation system. The binding energy scale was calibrated with respect to the Ce 3d 3/2 u″′ peak at 917.0eV [39] in Au/CeO2, and Zr 3d5/2 was set at 182.64eV for Au/CZ [40]. A 20eV pass energy was used to collect the spectra where the energy resolution corresponded to full width at half the maximum intensity (1.1eV) of the Au 4f 7 / 2 peak. The Ce 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2 signals for cerium (III) and (IV) were fitted following the procedure described by Romeo et al. [41] and % Ce3+ calculated from the integrated peak area ratios for Ce3+ with respect to the area of the entire spectrum."
4,Catalysis procedure,"2.3 Catalysis procedure The four samples (CeO2, CZ, Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ) were reduced (at 5Kmin−1) in 50cm3 min−1 H2 at 573K for 1h prior to catalysis. Reactions were carried out at 523–573K and 1atm in situ in a fixed bed vertical continuous flow glass reactor (l =600mm; i.d. =15mm). The catalytic reactor and operating conditions to ensure negligible heat/mass transport limitations have been described elsewhere [42], but features pertinent to this study are given below. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone where benzoic acid (or benzaldehyde) was vaporised and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst. Isothermal conditions (±1K) were ensured by diluting the catalyst bed with ground glass (75μm). The reaction temperature was continuously monitored using a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. Benzoic acid (or benzaldehyde) as an aqueous or ethanolic solution was delivered at a fixed calibrated flow rate to the reactor via a glass/teflon airtight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor-controlled infusion pump (Model 100kd Scientific). A co-current flow in ultra-pure H2 (<1% v/v organic in H2) was maintained at GHSV =1.7×104 h−1 with an inlet reactant molar flow rate (F)=2.5–8.4×10−5 molh−1. Molar Au to inlet organic feed rate (n/F) ratio spanned the range 0.03–0.28h. Product composition was determined using a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and FID, employing a DB-1 50m×0.20mm i.d., 0.33μm film thickness capillary column (J&W Scientific). Benzoic acid (Fluka, ⩾99% w/w purity), benzaldehyde (Fluka, ⩾98% w/w purity) and ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, ⩾99% v/v) were used as received without further purification. Repeated reactions with different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered a product composition that was reproducible to within ±6%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterisation measurements,"3.1 Characterisation measurements 3.1.1 BET area and pore size distribution Catalyst textural properties in terms of surface area, pore volume, crystal size and crystallographic phase can impact on redox behaviour [43]. Critical characteristics of the supports (CeO2 and CZ) and catalysts (Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ) are presented Table 1 . The CZ support presents a surface area (67m2 g−1) that falls within the range (15–128m2 g−1) reported in the literature for mixed oxides [44–46]. The CeO2 support exhibits an appreciably higher area with a pore size distribution (Fig. 2 ) in the range 20–100Å and a mean value of 46Å. In contrast, CZ shows a broader bimodal distribution of larger pores (mean=173Å) with a greater total pore volume (0.31cm3 g−1, Table 1). The average pore diameter for CeO2–ZrO2 has been shown to increase (from 30 to 250Å) with decreasing area (from 111 to 15m2 g−1) [44], and volumes in the range 0.11–0.33cm3 g−1 have been reported [44,47]. The larger pores and bimodal distribution in CZ confer a hierarchical and stable pore network [48], which contribute to enhanced thermal stability [43]. The incorporation of Au did not result in any significant modification to pore size characteristics or total surface area. 3.1.2 XRD analysis The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for Au/CeO2 (Fig. 3 (A)) presents eight peaks in the range 2θ =28–79° that can be associated with the main planes of CeO2 (JCPDS-ICDD reference 43-1002). The absence of any signal due to supported Au, notably at 38.2° (Au (111) plane), suggests that the Au particles are well dispersed and not detectable by XRD. The pattern for CeO2 (not shown) coincides with that recorded for Au/CeO2. Ceria exhibits a cubic-fluorite structure (space group Fm3m) and the lattice parameter (Table 1) is in agreement with the JCPDS reference (a =5.41Å). The XRD pattern of CZ (not shown) is identical to that recorded for Au/CZ (Fig. 3(B)) and exhibited a response similar to CeO2 with no detectable signals due to ZrO2. Studies of the structural properties and phase composition of Ce x Zr1− x O2 (0.2< x <0.8) [49–51] have revealed that the solid formed is not thermodynamically stable due to the difference in the ionic radii of Zr4+ (0.84Å) and Ce4+ (0.97Å) and associated crystallographic structures (monoclinic or tetragonal ZrO2 and cubic-fluorite CeO2). The mixed oxide can exhibit two tetragonal phases (t′ and t″) with a P42/nmc structure where the predominant phase is dependent on method of synthesis and crystal size [51]. The XRD results (Fig. 3, Table 1) for CZ and Au/CZ relative to CeO2 and Au/CeO2 show a shift to higher 2θ (by 0.5–1.5°) with a decrease in d 111 spacing (from 3.13 to 3.07Å), lattice parameter (from 5.41 to 5.34Å) and crystal size (from 10 to 6nm) that is in agreement with reported XRD analysis of Ce x Zr1− x O2 with a t″ structure [52–54]. These changes can be attributed to the incorporation of Zr in the framework resulting in a shortening of CeO bond length and decrease in the lattice parameter where values in the range 5.30–5.36Å have been recorded for Ce x Zr1− x O2 (0.6< x <0.7) [49,55,56]. 3.1.3 Carbon monoxide adsorption isotherms and HAADF-STEM analysis The occurrence of nano-crystals (dhkl <15nm, Table 1) is significant as crystalline ceria at the nanoscale is known to favour the formation of a well-dispersed supported metal phase [57]. In an earlier FTIR study of CO adsorption on Au/CZ [40], we established the occurrence of zero valent Au following calcination of Au/CZ under conditions used in this study. Carbon monoxide adsorption isotherms are presented in Fig. 4 where the CO/Au ratios given in Table 1 were determined from the difference in CO uptake recorded for the supported Au and bare support. We have previously demonstrated [39,40] that CO/Au data can be correlated with Au nanoparticle size distribution and are indicative of variations in gold dispersion (ratio of surface to total Au atoms, D =AuS/AuT). Representative HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 5 (A)) and associated Au size distributions (Fig. 5(B)) reveal similar dispersion of Au particles on CeO2 (D =0.40) and CZ (0.39) and equivalent mean size (1.5–2.0nm). The metal dispersion data are consistent with CO adsorption measurements. Gold particle size is critical in hydrogenation applications where significant activity is only observed for particles<10nm and is associated with an increase in low coordination edge and corner sites [58]. 3.1.4 TPR, OSC and H2 TPD measurements Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles are presented in Fig. 6 (A) and match activation conditions prior to catalysis. There was no measurable H2 consumption in the treatment of CeO2 or CZ, suggesting that the supports were not significantly reduced under these conditions. Published TPR analyses [28,59] have established H2 consumption by CeO2 at higher temperatures (670–800K), attributed to surface reduction with bulk transformation>970K. Reduction of Ce x Zr1− x O2 (x =0.5–0.8) is typically observed at temperatures in excess of 700K with maximum H2 consumption at ca. 850K [36,47]. As the Au phase was already reduced after calcination (pre-TPR) [40], the positive TPR signal at 420K observed for Au on both carriers can be ascribed to partial support reduction with the occurrence of spillover, i.e. dissociation on Au and diffusion of atomic H across the metal/support interface [36]. Spillover is important in hydrogenation reactions, providing a surface reservoir of reactive hydrogen that can contribute to increased rate [60]. Partial support reduction to generate oxygen vacancies is significant in this application as these vacancies can participate in reaction (via the MvK mechanism) [34]. The TPR step can then result in (a) introduction of chemisorbed hydrogen (reversible) and/or (b) formation of oxygen vacancies (irreversible) with the generation of water and Ce3+ to accommodate charge balance [61]. Reduction of CeO2 and Ce x Zr1− x O2 is limited by H2 adsorption [62], which is facilitated by Au as proposed for Au/CeO2 [28,59,63], Au/Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 [36] and Au/CeZrO4 [64]. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) post-TPR provides a measure of degree of support reduction [47]. FTIR analysis has confirmed that reduction of Ce x Zr1− x O2 generates Ce3+ with no evidence for Zr4+ reduction [65]. We accordingly relate the O2 consumed in the OSC analysis to Ce3+ formation and the data given in Table 1 establish a higher degree of Au/CZ reduction compared with Au/CeO2, which is consistent with the literature [47,50,55]. It is generally acknowledged that the incorporation of Zr into the ceria lattice can significantly enhance the thermodynamic reducibility of ceria [66,67] and impact on the kinetics of critical steps such as hydrogen activation [68] and diffusion of oxygen vacancies [62,69]. The H2 TPD profiles given in Fig. 6(B) are characterised by signals at Tmax =820±3K; there was no detectable H2 release from the bare supports. Hydrogen desorbed (Table 1) from Au/CeO2 was measurably higher, suggesting a greater reversible surface hydrogen component relative to Au/CZ, which exhibited increased support reduction (Ce4+ →Ce3+) during TPR. 3.1.5 NH3 TPD Catalyst acidity can influence selectivity by impacting on adsorption/desorption where benzoic acid is a stronger acid and carboxylate benzoates are better ligands than benzaldehyde or benzyl alcohol [17,22]. Surface acidity favours consecutive (hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis/MvK) reaction of benzaldehyde [12,17,20,22]. In contrast, carboxylate benzoates are strongly bound to basic oxides (MgO [7]) and decarboxylation (to benzene or benzophenone) can occur. Ammonia TPD was conducted to evaluate total surface acidity [70]. The TPD profiles are presented in Fig. 7 and temperatures for maximum release (Tmax ) and total NH3 desorbed are recorded in Table 1. The CeO2 support exhibited desorption over 320–670K that can be attributed to surface hydroxyl groups and weak Lewis acidity (Ce4+) where the Tmax and NH3 released are in reasonable agreement with the literature (Tmax =390–470K; 0.10–0.25mmol NH3 g−1) [71,72]. The TPD profile for CZ presents two desorption peaks at 387K and 537K as reported previously (Tmax =398 and 580K) for Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 [73], suggesting a values of acid strength. Ammonia release from CZ falls within the range (0.18–0.45mmolNH3 g−1) recorded elsewhere [71,73]. Both CeO2 and CZ have been characterised as weak Lewis acids where Zr inclusion increases the number of acid sites [71] and strength [74]. This is consistent with the measurably greater NH3 TPD from CZ (Table 1) and higher temperature desorption (Tmax =537K, Fig. 7(II)). Desorption peaks with Tmax in the range 530–600K have been reported for Lewis acid sites on ZrO2, i.e. Zr4+ [75,76]. The low and high temperature peaks may then coincide with desorption from Ce4+ and Zr4+, respectively. A decrease in acid strength has been observed [73] for Au and Pt supported on Ce–Zr mixed oxides, which may be reflected in the Tmax shift for Au/CZ relative to CZ (Table 1). Inclusion of Au with CZ was accompanied by a marked decrease in intensity of the lower temperature desorption peak. The decrease in acid strength and intensity of this desorption peak can be attributed to Ce4+ reduction to Ce3+, as demonstrated by OSC measurements. 3.1.6 XPS analysis Partial reduction of CZ was also determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) where the calculated % Ce3+ is in good agreement with that obtained from OSC measurement (Table 1). The XPS profiles over (A) the Ce 3d and (B) Au 4f binding energy (BE) range are presented in Fig. 8 . The Ce profiles present up to ten 3d signal components where the peaks denoted v 0, v, v′, v″ and v″′ correspond to the spin–orbit split of the Ce 3d 5/2 core, while the peaks designated u 0, u, u′, u″ and u″′ represent the Ce 3d 3/2 contribution [6,77,78]. The peaks due to Ce 3d 10 4f 0 O 2p 6 (u″′ and v″′), Ce 3d 9 4f 1 O 2p 5 (u″ and v″) and Ce 3d 9 4f 2 O 2p 4 (u and v) electronic states result from Ce4+, while Ce3+ is associated with 3d 9 4f 1 O 2p 6 (u′ and v′) and 3d 9 4f 2 O 2p 5 (u 0 and v 0) electronic states. The profile of Au/CeO2 (Fig. 8(AI)) exhibits the six peaks attributed to Ce4+ and the contribution due to Ce3+ (u′ and v′) is small, which is consistent with the low degree of reduction of the support (<10%). In contrast, Au/CZ exhibits four peaks due to Ce3+ (u′, v′, u 0 and v 0) that can be linked to significant levels of Ce4+ reduction. The Au 4f 7/2 BE values presented in Table 1 for Au/CeO2 (84.7eV) and Au/CZ (84.3eV) are higher than that reported for bulk gold (84.0eV [79]). Similar results have been reported elsewhere for reduced Au/CZ and the Au 4f 7/2 BE shift attributed to interrelated factors, notably initial Au oxidation state and possible metal–support charge transfer where Au nanoparticle size distribution (metal dispersion) is the governing factor."
7,Catalysis measurements,"3.2 Catalysis measurements Reactions operated under thermodynamic control favour pathways with lower enthalpies and higher negative Gibbs free energies. Taking the reaction network given in Fig. 1(A), the stoichiometric requirement (with respect to H2) for each step and associated changes in reaction enthalpy (ΔH 298K) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG 298K) [80] are presented in Table 2 . Formation of benzaldehyde via path I is endothermic (positive ΔH 298K), whereas all the other steps are exothermic with paths (II) and (VI) releasing the greatest heat. The ΔG 298K values can serve as indicators of possible thermodynamic limitations where reaction occurs spontaneously when ΔG 298K <0. It can be seen from the entries in Table 2 that benzaldehyde is a thermodynamically unfavourable product, while the formation of benzyl alcohol, toluene and benzene are favoured (ΔG 298K ≪0). Passage of benzoic acid over the supports alone, i.e. in the absence of Au, did not result in any detectable conversion. We can ascribe the absence of measurable hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis activity for CeO2 and CZ to the insignificant support reduction and hydrogen uptake/release on/from the bare carriers. Conversion of benzoic acid can then be attributed to the action of the supported Au phase. Reaction of aqueous benzoic acid solutions over Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ generated benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol as the only products with no observed toluene, benzene or benzophenone formation. This response is far removed from the product distribution that would result under thermodynamic control. Formation of benzene and benzophenone has been observed at higher temperatures (>673K) and longer contact times [22] over strongly basic catalysts (such as MgO [7]) or at low H2 surface coverage [21], conditions that are removed from those which prevail in this study. Aromatic ring reduction to give methyl-cyclohexane or cyclohexane-carboxylic acid did not occur, in contrast to reaction over Cu and Pt supported on ZrO2 [11]. The temporal dependence of benzoic acid fractional conversion (XBAC ) over Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ is shown in Fig. 9 (A), which reveals a time invariant (for up to 6h on-stream) response. This is significant as the catalysts that have been used to promote gas-phase benzoic acid hydrogenation (including CeO2) have exhibited loss of activity, which was attributed to coke deposition [5] and associated with toluene and benzene formation [6]. Applicability of a pseudo-first-order kinetic treatment can be tested using the relationship [81] (2) ln ( 1 - X BAC ) - 1 = k BAC n F where n/F is the molar ratio of Au to benzoic acid inlet flow rate. The linear relationship between ln(1− XBAC )−1 and n/F (Fig. 9(B)) confirms adherence to pseudo-first-order behaviour, and the rate constants (kBAC ) are given in Table 3 . An increase in reaction temperature (from 523 to 573K) served to elevate rate where higher kBAC values were recorded for Au/CZ relative to Au/CeO2. Hydrogenation activity and selectivity over supported Au have been shown to depend on: (a) Au particle size and morphology [38,82,83]; (b) surface hydrogen [84]; (c) nature of the support in terms of reducibility (oxygen vacancy site density), acid-base properties and interaction at the metal interface [32,85]. We can discount any contribution due to Au dispersion, which was equivalent for both catalysts (Table 1 and Fig. 5). While TPD results have exhibited a measurably greater H2 release from Au/CeO2, the difference was not significant and should not result in appreciable differences in rate. Cheng et al. [23] attributed increased benzoic acid hydrogenation activity with the incorporation of Mn on CeO2/Al2O3 to enhance support reducibility. The greater degree of Ce4+ reduction exhibited by Au/CZ (Table 1) with associated oxygen vacancy formation must contribute to the higher rate by activating benzoic acid for reaction. The variation of benzaldehyde (SBAD ) and benzyl alcohol (SBOL ) selectivities with conversion (XBAC ) is shown in Fig. 10 (I) for reaction over Au/CeO2 at 523K (AI) and 573K (BI) and Au/CZ at 523K (CI) and 573K (DI). Product selectivity was also constant with time-on-stream. It can be seen that benzyl alcohol selectivity increased with conversion over both catalysts and was favoured by a lower reaction temperature. At 523K, Au/CZ exhibited higher SBOL relative to Au/CeO2, but the reverse holds for reaction at 573K where Au/CZ delivered lower SBOL . The production of benzyl alcohol over oxides is known to proceed in a stepwise manner with the reduction of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde (path I, Fig. 1) and subsequent hydrogenation to the alcohol (path VIII) [7,22]. In addition to the stepwise conversion, we also consider here the possibility of a direct hydrogenation of benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol. The consecutive/parallel steps (see Fig. 1(B)) are (3) BAC + H 2 → k 1 BAD + H 2 O (4) BAC + H 2 → k 2 BOL + H 2 O (5) BAC + 2 H 2 → k 3 BOL + H 2 O and (6) dN BAC d ( n / F BAC ) = - ( k 1 + k 3 ) × N BAC (7) dN BAD d ( n / F BAC ) = k 1 × N BAC - k 2 × N BAD (8) dN BOL d ( n / F BAC ) = k 2 × N BAD + k 3 × N BAC where Ni represents the molar fraction of the ith compound and kj is the pseudo-first-order rate constant of step j. From a combination of Eqs. (6) and (7) (9) dN BAD dN BAC = - L + M × N BAD N BAC with L = k 1 k 1 + k 3 ∴ M = k 2 k 1 + k 3 which, when integrated gives (10) N BAD = L 1 - M × ( N BAC M - N BAC ) + C where C is a constant and the values of L and M can be determined by nonlinear fitting; L and M are given by k 3 k 1 = 1 - L L ∴ k 2 k 1 = M L The applicability of this parallel/consecutive model can be assessed from the plots presented Fig. 10(II); rate constant ratios (k 2/k 1 and k 3/k 1) are given Table 3. A ratio k 3/k 1 <1 is indicative of stepwise formation of benzyl alcohol (via benzaldehyde) where k 2/k 1 >1 favours alcohol formation. In contrast, k 3/k 1 >1 suggests direct hydrogenation of benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol, which is the case for Au/CeO2 at 523K. Given the limited support reduction observed for Au/CeO2, any contribution due to oxygen vacancies in the direct formation of benzyl alcohol over Au/CeO2 is minor. Benzoic acid can adsorb to form a surface benzoate where the carboxyl oxygen coordinates to surface cationic sites [10,15]. A bidentate coordination with one (chelating) or two (bridging) points of attachment has been proposed for benzoic acid adsorption on oxides [86]. The role of the metal/support interface can be critical in determining product distribution. Contributions due to surface defects, degree of coordination and electronic state of Au have been proposed to influence the catalytic response [87]. A bidentate adsorption of benzoic acid has been reported for Au (111) [88]. We note that NH3 TPD analysis has established surface acidity, most likely due to Ce4+. Therefore, we envisage a two-point attachment of benzoic acid on Au/CeO2 that generates a bridging bidentate benzoate via interaction with Ce4+ and Au sites as shown in Fig. 11 (A). Addition of surface hydrogen generates the alcohol in a single step. Reaction over Au/CZ at 523K shows a contribution due to both concerted and sequential pathways where stepwise conversion is preferred (k 3/k 1 =0.7). Given the higher density of oxygen vacancies on Au/CZ, this can be attributed to a MvK mechanism with benzoic acid activation at a vacancy site and reaction with surface hydrogen to give benzaldehyde (Fig. 11(B)). Surface hydrogen can react with the oxygen that filled the vacancy to form water, regenerating the active site [8]. The surface benzaldehyde as reactive intermediate can, in turn, be converted to benzyl alcohol via nucleophilic attack of CO, which does not require the involvement of oxygen vacancies [89]. Infrared analysis has demonstrated formation of an intermediate chemisorbed at a cationic metal site [10], which can react with surface hydrogen to give benzyl alcohol that desorbs into the gas phase (see Fig. 11(C)). A one-step benzoic acid→benzyl alcohol transformation over Au/CZ can result from carboxyl oxygen interaction with Au in close proximity to an oxygen vacancy that activates the second reactant oxygen (Fig. 11(D)). Oxygen interaction with the support vacancy facilitates CO scission, while hydrogen addition at the gold site generates the alcohol. The interaction of Au with oxygen vacancies at the metal/support has been shown to play a crucial role in the catalytic response of Au/CeO2 [90]. The presence of gold facilitates reduction to Ce3+, and oxygen vacancies are most likely created close to the support interface with metal nanoparticles [91]. Mechanism (D) involves synergism between Au sites and oxygen vacancies, which is facilitated on Au/CZ, exhibiting higher OSC and a well-dispersed Au phase. While a concerted surface reaction can proceed via both mechanisms, proposal (A) should predominate on Au/CeO2 given the higher relative Ce4+ content and lesser oxygen vacancy formation. An increase in temperature favoured concerted reaction over Au/CZ with a rate equivalency for both pathways (k 3/k 1 =1). The relative rate of sequential benzoic acid and benzaldehyde hydrogenation showed a marked response to temperature (k 2/k 1 decreasing from 13.1 to 1.8). In order to probe this effect, the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde was examined and the results (kBAD ) are included in Table 3. The conversion of the benzaldehyde feed delivered similar rate constants for Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ where benzyl alcohol was the sole product with no detectable toluene formation. This response suggests that the difference in surface acidity or number of oxygen vacancies does not affect CO reduction to C-OH to any significant extent, and benzaldehyde conversion in the stepwise mechanism (Fig. 11C) must proceed over equivalent sites on both catalysts. The significantly higher rate of benzaldehyde hydrogenation relative to benzoic acid conversion over Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ at 523K is consistent with the observed k 2/k 1 >1. The lower kBAD recorded at the higher temperature suggests benzaldehyde desorption from the surface that serves to lower rate and limits the sequential pathway, which is evident for reaction over Au/CZ (lower k 2/k 1, increased k 3/k 1). In contrast, an increase in reaction temperature to 573K favoured stepwise conversion (k 3/k 1 <1) over Au/CeO2. This suggests that the relative contribution of the reactive benzoate (Fig. 11(A)) to the overall surface mechanism is lower at the higher reaction temperature. The rate of benzaldehyde hydrogenation (kBAD ) exceeds that for the acid (kBAC ), which facilitates stepwise conversion to the alcohol. As expected for a sequential reaction, the selectivity/conversion plot (Fig. 10(BI)) shows a crossing point (at XBAC ≈0.17) and selectivity to the alcohol increased with conversion. The highest selectivity to benzyl alcohol (S =0.94) was achieved for reaction over Au/CZ at 523K and can be associated with a favoured stepwise route and high associated k 2/k 1. Contacting reducible oxides (CeO2 [92,93] and ZrO2 [1,11]) with water vapour occludes oxygen vacancies. A significant decrease in the conversion of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde [1] or toluene [11] has been observed after addition of water. Water can react readily with the surface of prereduced CeO2 and CZ with hydrogen evolution and the consumption of an oxygen vacancy. In order to check for a possible solvent effect, the hydrogenation of ethanolic benzoic acid solutions was examined at 573K and the selectivity/conversion responses are presented Fig. 12 . In addition to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol, formation of toluene was observed over both catalysts. Toluene can be generated (i) directly via deoxygenation of benzoic acid (step (II), Fig. 1) or (ii) from the consecutive reaction of benzaldehyde (step (III), Fig. 1) [22]. Both reactions have been proposed to occur through a MvK mechanism and require (i) twin or (ii) excess oxygen vacancies. We can explain the higher (by a factor 3) rate constants (kBAC , Table 3) and formation of toluene on the basis of an increase in available oxygen vacancies in the ethanol carrier. Reaction over Au/CeO2 (Fig. 12(AI)) resulted in a significant increase in benzaldehyde selectivity (in ethanol relative to water), which can be attributed to the contribution of oxygen vacancies, favouring the stepwise mechanism. Conversion of ethanolic benzoic acid over Au/CZ (Fig. 12(BI)) generated appreciable levels of toluene where selectivity converged with that for benzaldehyde at XBAC >0.4. Given selectivity invariance to the alcohol with conversion, toluene formation must occur principally via the consecutive reaction of benzaldehyde. The higher selectivity to toluene exhibited by Au/CZ compared with Au/CeO2 must be due to the greater vacancy site density on CZ. In contrast to the conversion of the aqueous feed, a temporal decline in activity was observed for the conversion of benzoic acid in ethanol (Fig. 12. (AII and BII), which can be linked to toluene formation and associated coking [12]."
8,Conclusions,"In this first reported application of supported Au to promote the gas-phase hydrogenation of benzoic acid, we have established significant differences in catalytic response for Au/CeO2 and Au/CZ. Gold incorporation by deposition–precipitation generated well-dispersed nano-sized (mean=1–2nm) Au particles on both supports, as deduced from CO chemisorption and HAADF-STEM measurements. The presence of Au facilitated support reduction, particularly in the case of CZ, to create oxygen vacancies (with reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ quantified by OSC measurements) while providing a supply of surface hydrogen. Hydrogenation of an aqueous benzoic acid feed generated benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol as sole products. Kinetic analysis has revealed that benzyl alcohol formation can proceed in a stepwise manner, via formation of benzaldehyde as a reactive intermediate, or in a single step (direct hydrogenation of benzoic acid). A higher overall rate of benzoic acid conversion was achieved with Au/CZ and can be attributed to the action of oxygen vacancies to activate the carboxyl function for hydrogen attack. Concerted hydrogenation was favoured over Au/CeO2 at 523K, which we attribute to a two-point interaction with Ce4+ and Au sites to generate a reactive benzoate where surface hydrogen addition produces the alcohol. Reaction over Au/CZ at the same temperature followed both sequential and concerted routes with preferential stepwise conversion where benzaldehyde is generated via an MvK mechanism and subsequently converted to the alcohol through surface interaction with Ce4+. An increase in temperature (to 573K) resulted in a measurable shift in favour of single-step conversion of benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol over Au/CZ. This is facilitated by activation of carboxyl oxygen at a support vacancy and polarisation of the second oxygen at an Au site. Use of ethanol as carrier increased oxygen vacancy availability with an enhancement in reaction rate, generation of toluene as a significant product and higher selectivity to benzaldehyde."
