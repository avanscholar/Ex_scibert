0,Introduction,"Currently, exploring clean and renewable energy sources and developing the corresponding technologies have become more intensive to mitigate the fast exhaustion of fossil fuels and the associated environmental impacts [1–3]. Hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water using electricity converted from the renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, waterfall, sea–wave, and geothermal has been recognized as the sustainable energy carrier, which possesses high energy density and zero emission when being utilized [4,5]. In the past decades, a variety of methods for hydrogen production have been developed, among which the water electrolysis is considered to be the most promising one for massive production of high–quality hydrogen [6,7]. Producing hydrogen through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode of water electrolysis requires highly efficient catalysts, whereas the most efficient and stable catalysts are precious metals–based materials, such as Pt–based materials. Due to high–cost and low abundance, their large–scale commercial applications have been largely limited [8]. Therefore, developing low–cost, earth–abundant and high–efficient non–precious metal catalysts for HER has become one of the most important research topics in energy conversion fields. In the past years, many non–noble metal catalysts have been explored with an attempt to replace the noble metal catalysts, including oxides [9], carbides [10–12], nitrides [13], phosphides [14], and sulfides [15]. Among these non–noble metal catalyst candidates, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) exhibits catalytic HER performance probably due to its high catalytic activity at the edge atoms of the sheets [16–18] and therefore has attracted increasing attention [19,20]. However, 2D MoS2 sheets are prone to stack together to cover the active sites, compromising their catalytic performance. Therefore, increasing the exposed active sites is the key to improving their HER performance [21,22]. Kibsgaard et al. [23] synthesized highly ordered mesoporous MoS2 thin film with a large number of exposed active sites for HER catalysis. Chung et al. [24] designed MoS2 nanospheres which could expose more active sites than MoS2 nanosheets, and display higher HER activity. Xie et al. [25] vertically grew defect–rich MoS2 nanowalls with different thicknesses on ITO substrate, where a large number of active sites were exposed for HER catalysis. As identified, MoS2 could be composited with other electrically conductive materials such as graphene to achieve improved performance [26]. In this regard, graphitic C3N4 (g–C3N4) has been considered as a candidate which boosted MoS2 catalytic performance if MoS2 was grown on g–C3N4 substrates to expose more active sites [15]. Fageria et al. [27] used a simple hydrothermal method to grow MoS2 nanosheets on g–C3N4. The hydrogen evolution performance of this catalyst is significantly improved compared to pure MoS2. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to higher charge carrier mobility in heterostructure interface, improved specific activity and large surface area. Fu et al. [28] prepared the ultra–thin MoS2/g–C3N4 material by in–situ interface engineering method, and the catalytic performance of the obtained material was improved by nearly two times compared with the ordinary physical mixed samples. Tian et al. [29] introduced a facile impregnation and heating method for the synthesis of MoS2/g–C3N4 for H2 evolution under visible light irradiation and achieved the highest H2 evolution rate of 23.10 μmol·h−1 on the 0.5 wt% MoS2–g–C3N4. Zhang et al. [30] constructed MoS2 nanosheets vertically anchored on g–C3N4 for high–efficiency electrochemical HER. This rational structure design endows MoS2 nanosheets with combined advantages of maximally exposed edges and defect–rich structure. Qian et al. [31] synthesized flower–like molybdenum disulfide/carbon nitride nanosheets with a thickness of only 4.6 nm by hydrothermal method. The ultra–thin thickness increases the number of active sites of the catalyst, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst. Graphitic C3N4 could offer abundant uniform nitrogen ligands [31], which not only functioned as metal coordination sites, but also as catalytic active sites [32]. The catalytic HER activity of MoS2/g–C3N4 can be improved through chemical bonding connection between MoS2 and g–C3N4 to increase the charge transfer rate from g–C3N4 to MoS2 in HER process. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective one–step in–situ hydrothermal technique where the highly dispersed MoS2 nanosheets can grow on g–C3N4 substrates with the aid of FeS2 as a bridging junction. The design takes the advantage of the lone electron pair of the N in the negative–electricity–like heptazine rings of g–C3N4 to trap positively charged ions, such as Fe3+ in this work. The trapped Fe3+ ions have regular divisions as the heptazine rings in g–C3N4 and they are located in an ordering manner on the g–C3N4 surface. Then, they can attract the negative molybdate (MoO4 2−) forming homogeneous distribution on g–C3N4 surface. The MoS2 nanosheets generated by hydrothermal have low agglomeration and high exposed surface area [33]. The introduction of Fe3+ ions prevent the MoS2 agglomeration caused by the repulsion force between N in the heptazine rings and MoO4 2− precursors. Furthermore, the FeS2 supply strong chemical bonding between g–C3N4 and MoS2 which acts as electron transfer channels during the HER process. As a result, the as–grown g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 nanocomposites exhibit excellent HER performance, which can be attributed to the uniform dispersion of MoS2 on g–C3N4 with the aid of FeS2, thereby enhancing the electron transfer rate between g–C3N4 and MoS2 through FeS and FeN bonds."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Urea, iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), sodium molybdate (vi) dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) and thioacetamide (TAA) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All the chemical reagents are of analytical grade (AR) and have been used without any further purification. Deionized water (DI) was used for all experiments."
3,Synthesis of g–C3N4,"2.2 Synthesis of g–C3N4 The g–C3N4 was synthesized from urea according to the previous reports [34,35]. In detail, 10 g of urea was placed in a crucible with a lid, heated to 550 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and kept at 550 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace. The obtained yellow powder was the g–C3N4 sample used in this paper."
4,Synthesis of MoS2,"2.3 Synthesis of MoS2 The MoS2 was synthesized by a simple one–step hydrothermal method. Typically, 0.6 g sodium molybdate (vi) dihydrate and 0.7 g thioacetamide were used as the molybdenum and sulfur sources, respectively. The precursors were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water under stirring for 2 h. Then, the precursors were transferred into a teflon–lined autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 18 h. The black colored MoS2 nanosheets were collected and washed with ethanol and DI water for several times, then the product was freeze–dried for 12 h."
5,Synthesis of g–C3N4/MoS2,"2.4 Synthesis of g–C3N4/MoS2 In a typical process, the as–synthesized g–C3N4 powder was dispersed into DI water to form a mixture, then sodium molybdate (vi) dihydrate (mass ratio g–C3N4:MoS2 = 2: 1) was added into this mixture and stirred for 2 h to form the uniform solution. Thioacetamide (molar ratio Mo:S = 1:4) was dissolved into this solution under stirring for 1 h. The resultant suspension was sealed in a teflon–lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 18 h to obtain a black precipitate, which was washed by distilled water and ethanol. The C3N4/MoS2 samples were achieved after drying at 60 °C for overnight."
6,Synthesis of g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2,"2.5 Synthesis of g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 The g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 nanocomposites with different concentrations of FeS2 were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Briefly, the as–prepared g–C3N4 was dispersed into deionized water to form an aqueous solution. Then different amounts of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (molar ratio Fe:Mo = 1:10, 3:10 and 5:10, respectively) were added into the g–C3N4 aqueous solution under stirring for 4 h to form mixture solution, respectively. Sodium molybdate(vi) dihydrate was separately injected into these three mixture solutions according to the mass ratio of g–C3N4:MoS2 = 2:1 under stirring for 2 h. Afterwards, thioacetamide (molar ratio Mo:S = 1:4 and Fe:S = 1:2) was separately added to the above three solutions with a further stirring for 1 h to form three mixtures, which were separately transferred into three identical teflon–lined autoclaves at 180 °C for 18 h. The obtained black precipitates were washed and dried at 60 °C overnight to obtain pre–products. Thereafter, all three pre–products were heated from room temperature to 550 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min in a tube furnace and stabilized for 1 h in an argon atmosphere to obtain the final g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 composites. The entire procedure is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
7,Characterizations,"2.6 Characterizations Powder X–ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the composite samples were characterized using a Philips high resolution X–ray diffraction system with Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies of the composites were observed on a Hitachi scanning electron microscope (SEM). TEM images were recorded by the FEI Themis Z aberration corrected STEM at 300 kV. X–ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X–RAY photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X–ray source (Al Kα, hν =1486.6 eV)."
8,Electrochemical measurements,"2.7 Electrochemical measurements The electrocatalytic HER performance was evaluated using a PGSTAT302N potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab, BV, Utrecht, The Netherlands). A graphite rod and calomel electrodes were used as the counter and the reference electrode, respectively. All the measurements were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, which was purged using high purity N2 gas before measurement. The glassy carbon electrode used as the working electrode substrate was polished with 1000 nm, 500 nm, 300 nm, and 50 nm alumina sequentially for a few minutes before loading catalyst. The individual working electrode was prepared according to the following procedure: 5 mg catalyst powder, 100 μL of 5 wt% Nafion® solution, and 200 μL isopropyl alcohol were dispersed in 700 μL deionized water by ultrasonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Subsequently, 10 μL well–dispersed catalyst was loaded on the glass carbon electrode (D = 3 mm) with a catalyst loading of 0.71 mg cm−2. The catalytic HER performance was tested by linear–sweep voltammogram (LSV) measurement from 0.1 V to −0.4 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, which was recorded after cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement between −0.15 and 0.1 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for 30 cycles in order to stabilize the current. For the long–term catalytic stability test, the working electrode was repeatedly scanned using CV measurement between −0.2 V and 0.05 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for 3000 cycles at a scan rate of 50.0 mV s−1, and then the catalytic stability was assessed in accordance with the potential changes before and after 3000 cycles measured by LSV. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted at a fixed potential of −0.2 V (vs. RHE) with frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. To determine the relative effective electrochemical surface area of the catalysts for HER, the cyclic voltammograms were recorded from 0.1 to 0.2 V (vs. RHE) with different san rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200 mV s−1, respectively. The total current density at 0.15 V (vs. RHE) was plotted as a function of the potential scan rate to obtain the plot. The slope value of this plot is the double layer capacitance Cdl, which can indicate the effective electrochemical surface area. All the potentials reported in this work were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by converting calomel electrode potential to RHE. The potential was calibrated to versus RHE according to the following equation [36]: E(vs. RHE) = E 0(SCE) + E(vs. SCE) + 0.059 × pH, where E 0(SCE) is 0.241 V, and E(vs. SCE) is the working potential in this experiment."
9,Results and discussion,"XRD analysis was performed to determine the phase of the as–synthesized materials and the results are shown in Fig. 1a and b. As shown in Fig. 1a, the characteristic peaks at 14.2°, 33.2° and 58.9° can be indexed as the diffractions of (0 0 2), (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) crystal planes of MoS2 (JCPDS 37–1492), respectively. The diffraction peak appeared at 27.4° corresponds to the diffraction of (0 0 2) plane of g–C3N4 (JCPDS 87–1526). As shown in Fig. 1b, the (0 0 2) peak of 14.2° of MoS2 in g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 is weakening with increasing FeS2 content, and finally becomes indistinguishable in samples with 30% and above of FeS2 contents, which means the lower crystallinity and less stacking of MoS2 nanosheets [37,38]. The characteristic peaks of g–C3N4 (2θ = 13.3° and 27.4°) cannot be observed in the XRD patterns, which may be buried in the background of strong diffraction peaks of MoS2. The missing of FeS2 signal is due to its low content caused by the low yield in the hydrothermal process and the loss in the calcination process. The XRD patterns of g–C3N4 before and after hydrothermal and calcination treatment are shown in Fig. S1. The intensity of characteristic peaks of g–C3N4 in the samples after hydrothermal and calcination treatment becomes weaker, indicating the rich defects in g–C3N4 [35]. Raman spectra of MoS2, g–C3N4/MoS2, and g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 are shown in Fig. S2. The characteristic peaks at 376.8 cm−1 and 402.8 cm−1 can be assigned to E 2g 1 and A g 1 vibration modes of MoS2. The two peaks are generated from in–plane and out–of–plane motion of the sandwiched S–Mo–S layer, which are consistent with those reported in literature [39–41]. In comparison with pure MoS2 sample, the decrease in intensity and the redshift in the peaks of E 2g 1 and A g 1 can be distinguished [24]. The Raman study confirms the as–synthesized MoS2 on g–C3N4 is in 2H phase [42–44]. In order to verify g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 heterostructure, X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical composition and the valence state of the elements. The results of g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2 are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3. The XPS spectrum of 30% FeS2 sample in Fig. S3a indicates the presence of C, N, Mo, S, Fe, and O elements. The C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. S3b) presents a strong peak at 284.6 eV that can be attributed to carbon–containing species (C–C/C=C) [45]. A relatively weak peak located at 286.2 eV corresponds to CN bond and the peak centered at 288.8 eV stands for the sp2–bonded C in N–C=N, respectively [46,47]. The N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2a) consists of three peaks located at 395.4, 398.1, and 399.8 eV pertaining to NC bond, a pyrrolic–like nitrogen atom, and FeN bond, respectively [48,49]. There is an additional peak located at 399.8 eV pertaining to FeN bond in N 1s XPS spectrum of g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2, comparing with the N 1s XPS spectrum of g–C3N4 (Fig. S4) [50,51]. This FeN bonding indicates a strong local interaction between FeS2 and g–C3N4 sheets. In Fig. 2b, the Fe 2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into three spin–orbit doublets. The peaks at 708.1 eV and 720.7 eV are corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, which are the characteristic peaks of the +2 oxidation state of iron atoms (Fe2+), the peaks with binding energies of 711.9 eV and 725.3 eV represent the presence of FeN bonding, and 710.9 eV and 724.5 eV are the superficial oxidation peaks of FeS2 [52–54]. In the spectrum of Mo 3d (Fig. 2c), the peaks corresponding to the binding energy of Mo–Ox can be observed at 232.9 eV and 236.0 eV due to the presence of partially oxidized MoS2, which stems from the contact with air or incomplete vulcanization. The Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks are observed at 229.4 eV and 232.5 eV, indicating the + 4–oxidation state of Mo ions in MoS2 [55–59]. In terms of the S 2p spectrum, the XPS peak can be divided into four peaks (Fig. 2d). The peaks at 163.41 eV and 162.2 eV are attributed to the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 orbitals of divalent sulfide ions (S2−) in MoS2, while those at 163.5 eV and 162.3 eV are assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of FeS bonding in FeS2 [60–62]. The results of pure g–C3N4, FeS2, MoS2 and g–C3N4/MoS2 are shown in Fig. S4. Fig. S4a shows the peaks located at 285.9 and 284.7 eV correspond to CN bond and carbon–containing species (C–C/C=C), respectively. Fig. S4b indicates that the peaks located at 398.2 and 395.8 eV can be attributed to the pyridine–like nitrogen atom and NC bond. The XPS spectra of g–C3N4, FeS2, MoS2, and g–C3N4/MoS2 are shown in Fig. S4c, S4d, S4e, S4f, S4g, S4h, S4i, and S4j, respectively. By comparing the S 2p XPS spectra of FeS2 (Fig. S4d), MoS2 (Fig. S4f), g–C3N4/MoS2 (Fig. S4j) and g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2 (Fig. 2d), the peaks located at 162.2 and 163.4 eV are corresponding with MoS and the peaks centered at 162.5 and 163.6 eV stand for FeS. Both FeS and MoS bonds can be identified in g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2, which indicates the FeS2 seeding function during the MoS2 growth. It should be noted that MoN bond has been observed in g–C3N4/MoS2 (Fig. S4h), which shows that g–C3N4 is partly chemical connecting with MoS2 along with the serious agglomeration. While the absence of MoN bond in g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2 evidences that FeS2 has connected g–C3N4 and MoS2 for the observation of FeN and FeS bonds [63]. The bridging FeS2 sites have been acted as the growth seeds of MoS2, which may bring about suitable microstructure for HER and improve electrochemical performance. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of g–C3N4/MoS2 with different contents of FeS2. As shown in Fig. 3a, g–C3N4/MoS2 is composed of the flower–like nanosheets, in contrast to the stacking pure MoS2 in Fig. S5b. As FeS2 content is increased from 10% to 30%, the samples experience a remarkable change on their topography from flower–like nanosheets into the intersected ultrathin nanosheets, indicating that the sample is evolved into a vertically grow of MoS2 on the surface of g–C3N4, as shown in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. However, when the FeS2 reaches to 50% as indicated by Fig. 3d, the samples are prone to stack up similar to the pure MoS2. As shown in Fig. S6a, g–C3N4 is in the appearances of nanosheet with curly edges. FeS2 also shows stacked nanosheet structure as shown in Fig. S6b. The slightly agglomerated MoS2 nanosheets can be observed in Fig. S6c. The g–C3N4/MoS2 is typical flower–like MoS2 grown on g–C3N4 and the g–C3N4 substrates benefit the increase of the specific surface area as shown in Fig. S6d. However, serious agglomeration is still an issue for the g–C3N4/MoS2. When 30% FeS2 is incorporated, the dispersion of MoS2 is significantly improved as shown in Fig. S6e, which increases the specific surface area and the exposure of active sites of MoS2 nanosheets [64,65]. The HRTEM images of g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The 0.63 nm interlayer spacing in Fig. 4b corresponds to the (0 0 2) crystal planes of MoS2 [66], whereas the 0.3 nm lattice fringes (Fig. 4b) corresponds to the (1 1 1) planes of FeS2 [67]. Therefore, the rational addition of FeS2 composition in the sample can effectively inhibit the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets and provide a vertical structure that facilitates rapid HER progress and gas release. Fig. S7 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of g–C3N4, MoS2, g–C3N4/MoS2, g–C3N4/10%FeS2/MoS2, g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2, and g–C3N4/50%FeS2/MoS2. All samples present type IV isotherm curves, characterizing the typical mesoporous material. The g–C3N4 shows the highest BET surface area due to its nanosheet structure. The MoS2 shows the smallest BET surface area (4.36 m2/g) due to the agglomeration according to the result of SEM and TEM, which suggests the lack of the available active sites on the catalyst surface. The MoS2 direct growth on g–C3N4 results in a BET surface area of 14.29 m2/g in g–C3N4/MoS2 (Fig. 5a). The addition of FeS2 can increase the BET surface area of the g–C3N4/MoS2 efficiently. The BET surface area of g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2 is as high as 65.07 m2/g, as shown in Fig. 5b. The pore–size distribution of g–C3N4/MoS2 exhibits a bimodal mesoporous structure centered at 3.2 nm and 6.1 nm in diameter, respectively, and the smaller pore size is predominant as indicated by Fig. 5c. The pore–size distribution of g–C3N4/30%FeS2/MoS2 is shown in Fig. 5d, and pore diameters are mainly distributed at 2.4 nm and 21.3 nm. The above results indicate that the diameters of pores gradually increase with the addition of FeS2, leading to an increase in BET surface area, which suggests an increase of the available active sites on the catalyst surface. To demonstrate the electrocatalytic properties of the as–synthesized catalysts toward HER, electrochemical analysis was performed in N2–saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. All initial data are calibrated by the ohmic potential drop (iR) to reflect the inherent behavior of the catalyst [68]. The polarization curves of all the as–prepared catalysts are compared in Fig. 6 . Both g–C3N4 and MoS2 show inferior electrocatalytic HER activity with an onset potential of −237 mV and –171mV, and –353mV, −263 mV at a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6a. The g–C3N4/30% FeS2 shows inferior electrocatalytic HER activity with an onset potential of –171 mV and achieves a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 at –334 mV. The MoS2/30% FeS2 shows higher HER activity comparing with pure MoS2. The MoS2/30% FeS2 achieves a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 at –231 mV, with an onset potential of –134 mV, demonstrating that the introduction of FeS2 can improve the HER activity of catalysts. The g–C3N4/MoS2 achieves a current density of 10 mA·cm−2 at −318 mV, with an onset potential of −207 mV. The g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 exhibits a high activity with the smallest onset potential of −107 mV and –193 mV at the current density of 10 mA·cm−2, which is more positive than the other as–prepared samples, demonstrating its high catalytic HER activity. The catalytic performances of g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 with different concentrations of FeS2 are displayed in Fig. 6b. When 30% FeS2 is introduced in g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2, this catalyst shows the highest HER activity among all the as–obtained samples, implying that the 30% FeS2 can optimize the dispersion of MoS2 on g–C3N4 and MoS2 nanosheets expose more active sites. The high catalytic activity is also confirmed by the highest current density among samples over the entire potential range. Tafel slopes can provide additional insight into the reaction mechanism and the inherent properties of the catalysts for HER, which can be obtained from the Tafel equation (η = b log ∣ j ∣ + a, where η is the overpotential, j is the current density, b is the Tafel slope, and a is a constant), as shown in Fig. 6c and d. Tafel slope can reflect the rate–limiting step of the HER and a small Tafel slope value means high HER rate. Typically, there are three possible principal reaction steps for HER in acidic electrolytes, including a water dissociation step (Volmer reaction, H + + e − → H ad ), an electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction, H ad + H + + e − → H 2) or a recombination step sequentially (Tafel reaction, H ad + H ad → H 2). The electrocatalytic water splitting can have two paths: Volmer–Heyrovsky step and Volmer–Tafel step, which can be judged from the Tafel slope. The Tafel slope of g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 (87.7 mV·dec−1) is lower than those of g–C3N4 (155.4 mV·dec−1), MoS2 (90.4 mV·dec−1), and g–C3N4/MoS2 (121.1 mV·dec−1) because MoS2 nanosheets in g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 are uniformly dispersed on g–C3N4. Tafel slopes of g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 prepared with different FeS2 concentrations are shown in Fig. 6d. Accordingly, the lowest Tafel slope (87.7 mV·dec−1) is observed in the g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 sample, demonstrating that the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism dominates the HER process and the Heyrovsky reaction is the rate–determining step [55]. Our results indicate that FeN and FeS bonds with g–C3N4 and MoS2 are beneficial for the enhanced HER activity, and appropriate FeS2 composition helps improve the dispersion of MoS2 nanosheets, leading to more exposed edge active sites. The HER mechanism catalyzed by g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 is proposed in Scheme 2 . First, H+ ions are adsorbed onto the active sites exposed at the edges of MoS2. Then, electrons are rapidly transferred from g–C3N4 to the active sites of MoS2 via FeN and FeS bonds and combine with adsorbed H+ to form Had. Finally, electrons are rapidly transferred from g–C3N4 to Had on MoS2 through FeN and FeS bonds and then react with H+ forming H2 molecules which can escape easily by taking the advantage of the vertical MoS2 assembling. All samples were further investigated by EIS measurement wherein a smaller arc radius denotes a reduced charge transfer resistance with respect to efficient charge transfer from the electrode to the electrolyte [69–71]. Nyquist plots of the prepared catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7a and b. In the high–frequency region, the electrodes with FeS2 modification exhibit similar semicircles, indicating that the corresponding equivalent circuit for the HER can be characterized by one time constant and the reaction is controlled by reaction kinetics [72]. A simplified equivalent circuit was used to fit the half circle and the corresponding resistance parameters are listed in Table 1 . Obviously, the structure of FeS2 assisted MoS2 growth on g–C3N4 can effectively reduce the semicircular radius, in particular, the g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 can achieve the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.961 Ω, in comparison with other catalysts (26.1 Ω for g–C3N4, 18.42 Ω for MoS2, 20.55 Ω for g–C3N4/MoS2, 10.16 Ω for g–C3N4/10% FeS2/MoS2, and 1.173 Ω for g–C3N4/50% FeS2/MoS2). Therefore, it is rational to argue that FeS2 induced FeN bonds with g–C3N4 and FeS bonds with MoS2 are beneficial to the increasing electron transfer rate. Rct is related to the electrocatalytic kinetics and the low value denotes high HER reaction rate [15,73]. Consequently, the lowest Rct can be observed in g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2, which proves 30% FeS2 is the optimum configuration in enhancing electron transfer process and reducing the charge recombination rate. Generally, the electrochemical performance of an electrocatalyst is correlated with its electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and electron transfer rate [74]. ECSA can be obtained through electrochemical double–layer capacitance (Cdl), which can be measured by CV. Fig. S8 shows the CV curves of g–C3N4, MoS2, and g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 within a potential range of 0.1–0.2 V vs. RHE at different scan rates of 20–200 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. At a potential of 0.15 V vs. RHE, double–layer charging currents are measured from the CV curves and are plotted against scan rates (Fig. 7c and d). Cdl of g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 is 20.9 mF·cm−2, which is 20 times higher than that of g–C3N4 (1.1 mF·cm−2) and 8 times higher than that MoS2 (2.7 mF·cm−2), indicating the highest exposure of effective active sites. The Cdl values of g–C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 with different FeS2 concentrations are also shown in Fig. 7d, which also demonstrates higher exposure of active sites than the other two samples with different FeS2 compositions (4.3 mF·cm−2 and 16.9 mF·cm−2 for samples with 10% FeS2 and 50% FeS2, respectively). The increase of active sites endues g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 nanocomposites with optimal HER activity. The calculated ECSA and roughness factor (Rf) values of the as–prepared samples are summarized in Table 2 . The g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 shows the highest ECSA (522.5 cm2) among all samples. This proves that it has more exposed electrochemically active surface area for HER compared with other samples. This calculation is consistent with our experimental observation. The stability is another issue restricting the practical application of the electrocatalysts, which should be taken into consideration in the assessment. The long–term electrochemical stability of the g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 catalyst has been tested using CV by scanning 3000 cycles between potentials of −0.2 V and 0.05 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 8a and b. Compared with the initial overpotential (−193 mV) of the current density at 10 mA·cm−2, the overpotential (−197 mV) has no obvious decay after 3000 cycles CV test, indicating that the obtained catalyst possesses high catalytic durability toward HER due to the strong interaction from the formation of the FeN bonds in the bridging structure. In addition, a long–term HER test was also conducted at 10 mA·cm−2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (Fig. 8c). After 10 h continuous test, the g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 still retains 90% of their original current density, indicating stable electrocatalytic performance. The sawtooth fluctuation under the durability test (the magnified area in Fig. 8d) reflects the decrease and increase of current density due to the periodic formation and release of H2 bubbles on the electrode [31]. H2 bubbles on the surface of the g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 catalysts are easier to release due to the good dispersion of vertical MoS2 nanosheets on g–C3N4 substrates."
10,Conclusion,"This research indicates that the FeS2 assisted growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the g–C3N4 substrates is an effective strategy to enhance MoS2 catalytic HER activity due to the FeN bonds with g–C3N4 and FeS bonds with MoS2, which induce high conductivity and charge transfer rate. Precise design of FeS2 composition in the catalyst is essential to optimize the dispersion of MoS2 in order to gain maximum exposed active sites. To be specific, g–C3N4/30% FeS2/MoS2 exhibits the best HER performance with a low overpotential (−193 mV at 10 mA·cm−2), a large electrochemically active surface area (522.5 cm2), small Rct value (0.961 Ω), low Tafel slope (87.7 mV·dec−1), and long cycle life (4 mV increases in overpotential of 3000 cycles of CV scanning). The HER performance improvement is attributed to three aspects: (i) the in–built FeN and FeS bonds as freeways facilitate the electrons transfer from g–C3N4 to MoS2 for HER; (ii) FeS2 assisted MoS2 growth helps the uniform dispersion of MoS2 nanosheets on g–C3N4 substrates and enables more exposed active sites; and (iii) the vertical growth of MoS2 induced by FeS2 benefits the release of H2. This study provides a new strategy to design and fabricate high–performance metal sulfide heterostructure electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen through water electrolysis."
