0,Introduction,"The scarcity of fossil fuels and the pollution issues associated with their use have attracted interest of government, scientific and industrial communities on the search for alternative, clean and ideal energy systems. Great efforts have been made to the eco-friendly hydrogen production methods, including electrocatalytic hydrogen production, photocatalytic hydrogen production and steam reformed hydrogen production [1–3]. Among those methods that are outside of carbon-cycle, photocatalytic hydrogen production by water splitting using solar energy is one of the more promising ways of achieving renewable and clean energy systems with its advantages such as the abundant resource, low cost, and zero pollution [4]. To obtain higher activity for photocatalytic hydrogen production, much more techniques assisted by photosemiconductor catalysts through water splitting process have been researched [5–10], for example, addition of sacrificial agents, surface modification of photocatalysts, etc. The sulfide/sulfite is the most common and effective agent up to now [11]. But to the best of our knowledge, the sacrificial agents have been extended to organics such as alcohols and lactic acid, etc. [12,13]. Among these sacrificial agents, glycerol (C3H8O3) as by-product of the chemical reaction transforming vegetable oil to biodiesel is given increasing attention [14,15]. The world demand for glycerol is limited and crude glycerol is becoming a waste product with an attached disposal cost, so that using glycerol to help enhance hydrogen production efficiency is rightly an economic and eco-friendly way to convert waste product to potential energy. ZnO, an n-type semiconductor, has been studied extensively as one of the most interesting photocatalysts due to their superior performance and potential applications [16,17]. In semiconductor-based photocatalysis, three successive primary processes are indispensable for an effective photocatalytic course, including the generation of electron–hole pairs by light harvesting, separation and transfer of the photogenerated electron and hole, and reduction and oxidation reactions taking place on the surface of the semiconductor-based photocatalysts [18–20]. However, owing to its relatively wide band gap (3.37eV), it can be activated mainly under UV light of wavelength below 385nm, which accounts for less than 5% of the solar light energy reaching the Earth's surface and therefore imposes restrictions on the application of ZnO photocatalysts. Considerable efforts are still being made to improve the photocatalytic properties of ZnO catalysts via promoting the electron transfer, and broadening the light absorption range. The methods reported in literature to enhance the activity of ZnO include (I) changes in the structural characteristics of ZnO, (II) combination of ZnO with different elements or semiconductors to form mixed photocatalysts with different band gap size and (III) addition of small amounts of metals or transition metal oxides (cocatalysts) to ZnO [21]. In the recent years, one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructures have attracted a great deal of research attention due to their great potential for fundamental research and technological applications [22,23]. Many types of 1D semiconductor nanostructures, such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanobelts, nanocables and nanorods have been fabricated by various methods [24,25]. Among them, core/shell nanorods may show distinctive properties. Sulphide/sulfide photocatalysts, which have narrow band gaps and valence bands at relatively negative potentials [26,27] compared to oxides, are good candidates for photocatalysts. Therefore, several wide band gap semiconductors (ZnS [28], CdS [29], ZnSe [30,31]) were employed as the shell layer material for the ZnO-based photocatalysts. Especially the ZnS is a nontoxic, chemically stable wide band gap (3.72eV for the cubic zinc blende material) semiconductor [32]. Furthermore, the core/shell structured ZnO/ZnS nanorods have been demonstrated to possess improved physical and chemical properties for electronics, magnetism, optics, catalysis, and other applications [33,34]. In addition, the case of hybrids with ZnS, the second component is directly in contact with the sulfidizing environment of the semiconductor. Hybrids of ZnS with metal sulfides may maximize chemical stability in these environments. Therefore we adopt the second sulfide-PdS to the system. As we know that the nanosized PdS is an interesting photocatalyst material, with a narrow band gap energy (1.6eV) and a suitable conduction band potential (−0.26V vs. NHE) to effectively reduce the H+ [35], having potential applications in lithographic films and plates, photographic films, catalytic photoelectrodes and solar cells [36,37]. Recently PdS has also been synthesized from electrospinning [38] or solventless thermolysis of the Pd-thiolate complex [39,40]. It is worth mentioning that the composite effect, the shell particle size distribution and molar ratios of shell components of the ZnO-based core/shell nanorods will make a significant influence on the photo absorption and recombination of photogenerated carriers. Here, for the first time, we report the facile two-step synthesis of ZnO/ZnS–PdS core/shell nanorods samples with different PdS/ZnS molar ratios, their full characterizations and photocatalytic properties for H2 production from a glycerol/water mixed solution in a fixed bed flow-type reactor. The effects of PdS/ZnS molar ratios on the morphology, photo absorption and the activity of ZnO/ZnS–PdS nanorods will be elucidated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts 2.1.1 Synthesis of ZnO nanorods All of the chemicals were analytical grade reagents, and used as received without any purification. In a typical experiment, firstly, 18.3g zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), was dissolved in 200mL distilled water under mild magnetic stirring in ice-water bath (0°C), followed by the addition of 0.5g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to the solution. After 30min, 90mL 5M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution was added dropwise to form a clear aqueous solution. This clear solution was aged at 50°C water bath with stirring for 5h to yield a white ZnO precipitate. Finally, the ZnO sample was collected by centrifugation and was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol for several times before drying at 80°C for 12h. 2.1.2 Synthesis of ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanorods 0.74g sodium sulfide (Na2S) was dissolved in 100mL deionized water. One gram of the as-prepared ZnO nanorods were well dispersed in the above sodium sulfide (Na2S) solution under stirring, and then the suspension was placed in a 60°C water bath with magnetic stirring for 6h. The product was then collected by centrifugation of the aforementioned suspension with washing of deionized water, and dried at 80°C for 12h. Thereafter, the ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanorods with a ZnS/ZnO molar ratio of 0.2 were prepared (the amount of ZnS on the surface of the ZnO nanorods was calculated based on the S2− moles consumed in the reaction). 2.1.3 Synthesis of ZnO/ZnS–PdS core/shell composite nanorods The ZnO/ZnS–PdS core/shell composite nanorods were prepared by in situ chemical conversion process using ZnS on the shell of ZnO/ZnS nanorods as sacrificial templates to PdS. In a typical synthesis, 0.5g of the as-prepared ZnO/ZnS nanorods were dispersed into 100mL distilled water under magnetic stirring followed by the drop wise addition of 0.5mL aqueous solution of PdNa2Cl4 with a measured concentration (0.05mmol/mL). After the reaction at room temperature for 6h, the mixture was then collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with distilled water and absolute ethanol to remove any coprecipitated salts and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80°C overnight. By changing the volume of PdNa2Cl4 aqueous solution (0.5mL, 1.5mL, 2.5mL, 4mL, 5mL), the five ZnO/ZnS–PdS nanorods samples with different PdS/ZnS molar ratio were obtained, marked as ZnO/ZPS-X (X =1, 2, 3, 4, 5), respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the samples were recorded on a D/MAX-2500 automatic powder diffractometer equipped with the graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation flux (λ =0.15418nm) at a scanning rate of 0.02s−1 in the 2θ range of 20–80°.The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM, 5kV) equipped with EDX detector (Thermo Scientific, USA, 15kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and mapping images were obtained with JEOL-2100F system (200kV). Specimens for TEM and HRTEM measurements were prepared via drop-casting a droplet of ethanol suspension onto a copper grid, coated with a thin layer of amorphous carbon film, and allowed to dry in air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded with an SSX-100/206 probe using nonmonochromatized Al–Mg Ka X-ray as the excitation source (Japan). Binding energy was calibrated with respected to the signal for C 1s of 284.8eV. Ultraviolet and visible diffusive reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were taken on an UV-vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 35), the scanned range being 200–800nm against barium sulfate standard."
4,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity test The homemade apparatus was used for the photocatalytic activity test, which consists of a light source, an inner irradiation-type quartz photoreactor, and an online analysis system as shown in Fig. 1 . Two different light sources were used in the present study: (a) a UV light source (high-pressure Hg lamp, 125W) cooled with a fan, (b) a solar-simulated light source (Xe lamp, 500W) cooled by an external jacket with circulating water (no UV cut-off filter installed and circulating water acted as filter for IR radiation). The temperature of the irradiated surface of the catalyst was monitored by a thermocouple directly inserted into the catalyst bed. In a typical reaction, a 60mg catalyst mixed with 5mL quartz sand was loaded into the reactor, and afterwards 10mL 5% glycerol solution was added to the reactor dropwise. Argon was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 20mL/min through the reactor to the analysis system. The products of the reaction were analyzed in situ by an on-line thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatography (nitrogen as a carrier gas). The hydrogen production rate is calculated according to following formula: hydrogen production rate ( μ mol / h g ) = H 2 % ( V / V ) × flow rate ( 20 mL / min ) × 60 × 1000 22.41 ( L / mol ) × the quality of catalyst ( g )"
5,Results and discussion,
6,The structure characterization of nanorods,"3.1 The structure characterization of nanorods The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized ZnO-based core/shell nanorods are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction peaks of the curve (a) can be assigned to hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS36-1451), and no impurity peaks are observed. From the overall XRD diffraction curves, we can see the main 9 peaks corresponding to the ZnO, suggesting that the ZnO core part exists in all samples. The patterns of the ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanorods (curve b) consist of two sets of diffraction peaks (ZnO and ZnS), and the broadening peak at 2θ =28.62° matches well with the face–centered-cubic ZnS (JCPDS65-0309). Because the peaks at 2θ =47.83° of (220) and 2θ =56.76° of (311) crystal plane are very close to the diffraction peaks of (102) and (101) crystal plane of ZnO, these peaks are overlapped together, respectively. In addition, the intensity of the ZnO diffraction peaks decrease obviously with the deposition of ZnS shell layer on the ZnO nanorods. No diffraction peak assigned to PdS can be observed in the ZnO/ZPS-X core/shell nanorods, which may be due to the tiny content and high dispersion of PdS. The peak intensity of ZnS becomes weak gradually with the increase of Pd content (Fig. 2(c)–(g)), which indicates the conversion of ZnS to PdS. The pure ZnO hexagonal rods with a smooth surface as shown in Fig. 3(a) has the average diameter of ca. 150nm and the length of hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. The SAED pattern of nanorod (Fig. 3(b)) proves its single crystal nature and growth direction along the (001) direction (c-axis). It can be seen from Fig. 3(c) that the surface of the ZnO nanorods became rougher and thicker, indicating the conversion of ZnO to ZnO/ZnS core/shell structure based on the surface sulfidation. The HRTEM image shows that the shell is composed of tiny primary particles ca 5–8nm in diameter and the thickness of ZnS shell is about 15–25nm (Fig. 3(d)), and the interplanar spacing of 0.31nm is related to the (111) lattice plane of the standard cubic ZnS. Fig. 3(e)–(i) shows representative SEM and TEM images of ZnO/ZnS–PdS nanorods. Accordingly, after the addition of Pd2+ solution, cation exchange begins at the interfaces between the ZnS shell surface and Pd2+ solution, ZnS was gradually substituted by PdS nanoparticles. The conversion dynamic of single component shell to bi-component shell comes from the marked difference in solubility-product constant (Ksp) between ZnS (Ksp=2.93×10−25) and PdS (Ksp=2.03×10−58) [37]. From the chemistry dynamic point of view, this type of ion exchange reaction has high yield. The SEM images and TEM insets in Fig. 3(e)–(i) reveal that the thickness of the shell layer of nanorods is still at the range of 15–25nm, while the surface of shell becomes rougher and PdS presents in the form of hemispherical particles. In addition, the corresponding SAED pattern (Fig. 3(k)) obviously exhibits the diffraction rings are consistent with single-crystal ZnO (highlighted by circles) and polycrystalline ZnS–PdS composite nanoparticles. Especially the three apparent rings correspond to the (111), (220) and (311) planes of cubic ZnS structure, which is in correspond with the XRD data. Because of the small concentration and high dispersion of PdS, the SAED pattern of PdS present weak diffraction halo. As observed from the HRTEM images (Fig. 3(j)) taken from the edge of the individual rod, the shell boundary between ZnS and PdS is free of amorphous phases, which is an indication of the formation of atomic heterojunctions. The intimate lattice contact between the ZnS and PdS would be in favor of efficient photogenerated holes transfer across the ZnS–PdS interface and consequently reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers. This reasoning is also supported by literature [41]. Accordingly, the EDX analysis shown in Fig. 4 reveals that the as-prepared nanorods contain considerable amount of zinc, oxygen, sulfur and palladium, which confirms the successful incorporation of Pd element into the ZnS shell after the cation exchange. EDX mapping images (Fig. 4) of ZnO/ZnS–PdS single nanorod clearly show that Zn, S and Pd are uniformly distributed along the nanorod, while O element mapping image demonstrates the oxygen concentrations are evidently rich in the core part and rare in the shell part, which is much more evident for the destroyed nanorods sticking to the edge of the nanorod. Comparably, the Pd and S elements are found on the same spots corresponding to the position of the surface nanoparticles in the shell layer. Zn:Pd:S and PdS:ZnS molar ratios calculated from EDX spectrum of ZnO/ZPS nanorods are listed in Table 1 . We could see that Pd:S and PdS:ZnS ratio becomes higher with the increase of the Pd2+, which is due to the fact that more ZnS is replaced by PdS with the cation exchange reaction."
7,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study,"3.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study XPS was used to investigate the surface constitution and properties of the samples. The peaks from Zn 2p, O 1s, S 2p and Pd 3d were detected and the corresponding spectra are plotted in Fig. 5 . The peaks at 1021.95eV are assigned to Zn 2p in ZnS bond (not shown), which indicates that the materials contain ZnS. The Fig. 5B reveals the presence of two peaks corresponding to lattice oxygen of ZnO bond (530.0eV) and the chemisorbed oxygen of OH bond (531.9eV) respectively [42]. When compared with the pure ZnO, O 1s peak located at 530.0eV is detected and shifts a little after the deposition of ZnS nanoparticles, and its peak area decreases sharply, which shows that almost no ZnO crystal exists in the ZnS shell layer. The ZnO/ZPS-3 and ZnO/ZPS-5 both show a larger O 1s peak area and intensity of lattice oxygen as compared with the ZnO/ZnS sample, which could be attributed to the aggregation of PdS in the shell layer and the exposure of ZnO core. The XPS peaks of S 2p could be fitted mainly into two components at 162.9 and 161.6eV, which can be related to S2− in ZnS bond and PdS bond, respectively [42,43]. The apparent difference in peak areas of S 2p and Pd 3d with the change of Pd content indicates the conversion from ZnS to PdS. No peak corresponding to Pd0 can be detected in the spectra (Fig. 5D), suggesting nanorods do not contain metal Pd. [39]. In addition, Zn:Pd:S and PdS:ZnS molar ratios calculated from XPS spectrum of ZnO/ZPS nanorods are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the PdS/ZnS ratios increase obviously with the increase of the addition amount of Pd2+, which further proves that ZnS is converted to PdS gradually. Table 1 also shows that the Zn/Pd/S and PdS/ZnS values derived from XPS spectrum and EDX of the same sample are different, which could be due to the different interaction volume between XPS and SEM–EDX. The EDX is more likely to be heading toward a bulk analysis, whilst the XPS will be related more to the surface. For this reason, the PdS/ZnS ratios obtained from EDX represent the whole shell component, but those obtained from XPS reflect the outside surface component of the shell. When compared the PdS/ZnS ratios between XPS and SEM–EDX, we can find that the PdS/ZnS ratios from XPS are far less than those from SEM–EDX, which indicates that the conversion of ZnS to PdS may be easy to occur from inside of the shell layer rather than the surface of shell."
8,UV–vis analysis,"3.3 UV–vis analysis The optical absorbance of ZnO nanorods, ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnS–PdS core/shell nanorods were measured by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 6A. In comparison with the ZnO nanorods, an apparent enhancement of absorption can be observed for all of the ZnO/ZnS–PdS heterostructure, especially for the wavelengths greater than 410nm, which could be explained by the enhancement of surface electric charge of the nanorods photocatalysts. This would have an influence on the fundamental process of production of electron/hole pairs and their separation in the photocatalytic process. The Fig. 6B and Table 2 showed the corresponding Kubelka–Munk plots and the band-gap energy (Eg) of ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, and ZnO/ZnS–PdS nanorods, respectively. We could obtain the band-gap energy for allowed transitions according to the literature, [44] which was determined by finding the intercept of the straight line in the low-energy rise of a plot of [F(R ∞ )hv]2 against hv, where F(R ∞ ) is the Kubelka–Munk function, and hv is the incident photon energy. [45] It was found that Eg of ZnO/ZPS-5 sample was calculated to be 3.22eV. The calculated Eg from the Table 2 confirms the wider absorption range for ZnO-based materials, which was ascribed to the proper PdS loading, the dark color of the samples and the composite interaction among the ternary structure. Based on the above analysis, it is anticipated that the ZnO/ZnS–PdS samples should possess higher photocatalytic activity as compared with the PdS-free catalysts."
9,Photocatalytic activity,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity The performance of the photocatalytic H2 production from glycerol solution (volume percentage=5%) under UV light (Hg-lamp) and solar-simulated light (Xe-lamp) irradiation in the presence of various catalysts samples is depicted in Fig. 7 . Both the gas and liquid products analysis indicated that only H2, CO2, and glycerol were detected and no any other organic compounds could be found. The pure ZnO nanorods showed negligible photocatalytic activity and little changes even if the temperature increases to 60 or 80°C under UV light irradiation. After the deposition of the ZnS nanoparticles on the surface of the ZnO nanorods, the hydrogen yields were enhanced about 51% compare to that of pure ZnO nanorods (taking the data of 40°C as an example). Fig. 7 also shows that the effects of PdS content on the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO/ZnS nanorods. All of the ZnO/ZnS–PdS composite nanorods present higher photocatalytic H2 evolution rate than that over ZnO/ZnS, revealing that the content of PdS in the shell affects largely the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/ZnS nanorods. The hydrogen yields of ZnO/ZPS-1 is increased about 54% compared to that of ZnO/ZnS, which is similar to the activity increase range between ZnO and ZnO/ZnS, especially at lower temperatures. The rate of the photocatalytic H2 production continues to enhance with an increase of PdS content in the shell, and then it decreases with the further increase of PdS amount. The ZnO/ZPS-3 nanorods exhibit a maximum H2 production rate of 2141.9 and 238.1μmolh−1 gcat−1 under UV light and the solar-simulated light irradiation, which is increased about 139% and 60% than that of ZnO/ZPS-1 and ZnO/ZPS-2, respectively. Based on the discussion and characterization mentioned above, ZnO/ZPS-3 composite nanorods with a proper PdS/ZnS molar ratio (PdS:ZnS=0.149) and suitable shell thickness show excellent photo absorption compared with the other samples, which favors the separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and thus retards the recombination of charge carriers. Because of much higher molar ratio of PdS/ZnS (PdS:ZnS=0.479 & 0.979 in Table 1), the agglomerate of PdS into larger particles and surface exfoliation over the ZnO/ZPS-4 and ZnO/ZPS-5 samples (as seen from the Fig. 3(h) and (i)), the active surface area, surface n–p heterojunction amount and photo absorption decline, which finally leads to the falling down of their photocatalytic performance. The reaction temperature also affects the photocatalytic performance under UV irradiation in the range of 40–80°C (Fig. 7). Additionally, the increased rate of hydrogen evolution at 60–80°C could be attributed to the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of reactants and products, and diffusion of adsorbed species, among others. Possibly, temperature influences the thermodynamic catalytic reaction steps on the catalysts surface. For ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanorods, a heterojunction is formed after deposition of ZnS on the surface of ZnO, which changes the charge transfer route in the ZnO nanorods as shown in Scheme 1 . The conduction band of ZnS lies on a more negative potential than that of ZnO, whereas the valence band of ZnO is more positive than that of ZnS [42]. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of ZnS nanoparticles transferred to that of the ZnO nanorods, and holes on the valence band of ZnO are transfered to that of the ZnS. The photogenerated holes can be trapped by water molecules or surface hydroxyl to form high oxidative hydroxyl radical species (OH), which will oxidize C3H8O3 to CO2 [46]. In the meantime, the electrons are captured by H+ on the surface of ZnO, resulting in the formation of H2. The reaction is taken out in the solution containing easily oxidiable reducing agents (glycerol). The photoinduced holes preferentially oxidize glycerol, which prolongs the lifetime of electrons and reduces the recombination of charge carriers. Therefore, the photocatalytic efficiency is significantly enhanced. With the addition of PdS, photo generated electrons in ZnO and ZnS are migrated to the conduction band (CB) of PdS, and the PdS particles become the active center of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Owing to the more amount and longer lifetime of photo-generated electrons, photocatalytic H2 evolution rate is improved obviously."
10,Conclusions,"We have synthesized the novel type of semiconductor materials consisting of ZnO core and ZnS–PdS composite shell via a facile two-step approach combining liquid-phase chemical conversion process in low temperature hydrothermal growth and cation ions exchange. The ZnO/ZPS-3 composite nanorods give a maximum H2 production of 2141.9 and 238.1μmolh−1 gcat−1 under UV light and the solar-simulated light irradiation from glycerol/water mixtures, which could be resulted from the reasons as follows: (I) synergetic effect between core and the uniform distribution of composite shell components, (II) enlarging the light utilization rate by broadening the light absorption range (III) retarding the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, the strategy might open up an opportunity for extensive study of other new active ZnO-based photcatalysts for more and more applications."
