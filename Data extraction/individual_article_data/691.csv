0,Introduction,"Polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE, -(CF2CF2)n-], a homopolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) monomer, is popular and useful for the industrial applications [1–3]. TFE monomer is utilized also for the production of various kinds of copolymers [3–7]. The thus-produced copolymers possess the various excellent properties beyond the PTFE mother polymer. Some of the well-known TFE copolymers are ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene alternating copolymer [ETFE, -(CH2CH2CF2CF2)n-], vinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene random copolymer [VDF-TFE, -(CH2CF2+CF2CF2)n-], and so on. The ETFE copolymer is produced to cover the weak point of PTFE; for example, an improvement of the stress cracking phenomenon of the highly-constrained PTFE sample occurring in the high temperature region [8–11]. The VDF-TFE copolymer is a kind of ferroelectric fluorine polymers [12]. These copolymers show the crystal phase transitions between the low-temperature and high-temperature phases by heating or cooling. The details of the crystal structural changes in these phase transitions were reported in many papers [13–27]. Among many kinds of TFE copolymers, we focus here the vinyl alcohol [CH2CH(OH), VA]-tetrafluoroethylene [TFE] alternating copolymer. This alternating copolymer is unique in such a point that the hydrophilic (VA) and hydrophobic (TFE) monomeric units are arrayed alternately along the chain. The random copolymer of VA and TFE monomeric unis was already known [3–7,28]. However, when we searched the papers of this alternating copolymer, only one report was found out [29]. In that report, the miscibility of polymer samples blended with this alternating copolymer was discussed, but no details of pure alternating copolymer were studied except the glass transition temperature and temperature-dependent infrared spectra. In this way, we do not have any basic knowledge about the crystallization and thermal behavior, crystal modifications, their crystal structures, the phase transition behavior between these modifications, etc. In such a sense, this TFE-VA alternating copolymer is still a kind of novel TFE copolymer at present. As will be described in this paper, we measured the X-ray diffraction data and found out the existence of the two types (more strictly, three types) of crystal modifications depending on the sample preparation conditions. Besides, the phase transitions between these crystal forms have been detected also from the temperature dependence of the X-ray diffraction and infrared spectral data in addition to the thermal data analysis. The characteristic features of the alternating copolymer were compared with those of the conventional random copolymer between VA and TFE monomeric units. Unfortunately, the present authors do not know to what extent this alternating copolymer (not random copolymer) is promising in the industrial application. But, the structural information revealed here should be important as the scientifically basic knowledge useful for the industrial development of this substance. The present paper is the first report to describe the thermal behavior, phase transitions, and concrete structural features of the crystalline forms on the basis of the quantitative X-ray and IR spectroscopic data as well as the thermal data."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples TFE-VA alternating copolymer and TFE-VA random copolymer with the 1:1 M ratio were supplied by AGC (Asahi Glass Co. Ltd.), Japan. The degree of alternation of the two kinds of monomers is about 92%, as estimated by the 1H-, 19F and 13C NMR spectral data analysis. The number-averaged molecular weight (M n) was about 12 × 104 g/mol and the M w/M n ratio was about 2.3 for the alternating copolymer. The M n and M w/M n of the random copolymer were 7 × 104 g/mol and 3.7, respectively. The melting point of the alternating copolymer was about 220 °C as detected in the DSC thermogram (Fig. 1 ), much higher than that of the random copolymer of the same content, about 206 °C (Fig. 2 ). The melting enthalpy (ΔH m) was 3.41 kJ/mol momomeric unit (m. u.) for the alternating copolymer and 2.18 kJ/mol m. u. for the random copolymer. The glass transition point (Tg) of the alternating copolymer was 75–85 °C [29], almost the same as that of the corresponding random copolymer, about 85 °C. In order to find out the crystalline modifications, various types of the samples were prepared by changing the conditions: (i) a melt-quenching to 0 °C, (ii) a casting from the acetone or tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution at room temperature, (iii) a uniaxial stretching of (i) and (ii), and (iv) an annealing of (iii) at 170 °C under tension."
3,Measurements,"2.2 Measurements The 2D wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns were measured using Rigaku X-ray diffractometers, Rapid-2 and R-axis VII with the imaging plate detector of cylindrical type and flat type, respectively. The incident X-ray beam was a graphite-monochromatized Mo-Kα line of wavelength 0.7107 Å. A series of the 1D-diffraction profiles were measured in the heating and cooling processes to study the phase transition behavior by using a Rigaku TTR-III X-ray diffractometer equipped with a DSC cell. The incident X-ray beam was a Cu-Kα line of 1.5418 Å wavelength. The temperature dependence of the 2D X-ray diffraction patterns of the uniaxially-oriented samples was measured using the R-axis VII diffractometer equipped with a homemade heater. The sample temperature was monitored by winding a thermocouple around the sample. The temperature dependence of the infrared spectra was measured using a homemade heater set on a Varian FTS-7000 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. The thermal data were measured with a TA instrument DSC-Q1000T at a heating/cooling rate of 2 °C/min under the nitrogen gas flow."
4,Simulations,"2.3 Simulations The energy minimization was performed for isolated chains and crystal structures under the periodical boundary conditions using a commercial software Materials Studio (Biovia) with the COMPASS force field [30]. The energy optimization was performed also using a density functional theory (DFT) with the DMol3 program (Materials Studio). The functional was PBE of the GGA (general gradient approximation) category [31]. All electrons were included in the calculation. The basis set chosen was DNP (double numerical polarization) functions (version 4.4) [32]. The X-ray diffraction patterns were calculated using a commercial software Cerius2 (version 4.10, Biovia)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Crystallization and phase transition behaviors,"3.1 Crystallization and phase transition behaviors 3.1.1 Thermal analysis Fig. 1 shows the DSC thermograms measured for the alternating TFE-VA copolymer samples prepared under the various conditions. The melt-quenched sample [thermogram (c)] showed the melting peak at around 220 °C. The glass transition peak (Tg) was broad but at around 70–85 °C [29]. In the cooling process from the melt [(e)], the crystallization peak was detected at around 190 °C. A small shoulder was seen at around 160–130 °C and a Tg signal at about 80 °C. In the second heating (d), in addition to Tg, a broad shoulder was detected at around 130–160 °C as similarly to that in the cooling process, which might be due to some transition, as will be discussed later. As seen in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), the solution-cast films showed the DSC thermograms appreciably different from that of the melt-cooled sample. The THF-cast film [(b)] showed the two broad endothermic peaks in the 40 and 80 °C regions, and a clear exothermic peak at 170 °C, followed by the melting peak at 220 °C. The similar thermogram was observed for the acetone-cast film, although the broad peaks were detected at 40 and 75 °C, slightly different from those of the THF-cast film. These small peaks disappeared in the second heating process, probably originating from the evaporation of the residual solvent, and the DSC thermogram was the same as (d). The exothermic peak at 170 °C is related to the phase transition between the two crystal forms obtained by cooling from the melt and by casting from the solution, as will be revealed by the X-ray diffraction measurements. As shown in Fig. 2, the random copolymer sample cast from the THF solution gave the small peaks in the low temperature region, which disappeared after heating up to the melting at 206 °C. Once after the sample was cooled from the melt, the melting and crystallization phenomena were detected reversibly as seen from the sharp peak in the heating (c) and cooling (b) processes, respectively. No peak suggesting a phase transition was detected for the random copolymer except the melting peak, being different from the case of TFE-VA alternating copolymer. 3.1.2 The 1D X-ray diffraction data Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependences of the 1D X-ray diffraction profiles measured in the heating process for (a) the melt-cooled and (b) melt-quenched samples. Fig. 3 (c) shows the diffraction profile change in the cooling process from the melt. The quenched sample gave a broad halo peak at room temperature [(b)], indicating the amorphous state. At around 170–180 °C in the heating process, the crystalline peak started to appear at around 18° (2θ) and disappeared at the melting point. In the cooling process [(c)], the molten sample crystallized at around 196 °C as known from the appearance of a peak at 17.9°, which shifted toward the higher 2θ side due to the thermal contraction of the crystal lattice. In the second heating run of the melt-cooled sample [(a)], the X-ray diffraction peak behaved in the similar way as detected in the cooling process [(c)]. On the other hand, the THF-solution-cast film showed the X-ray diffraction profile different from that of the melt-cooled sample. As seen in Fig. 3 (d), a peak at 17.7° became stronger with an increasing temperature, but the intensity became weaker again at around 170 °C and coexisted with the new peak appearing at 18°, which corresponded to the peak observed for the melt-cooled sample in the same temperature region [(a)]. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the integrated intensity of the main peaks at around 18° measured for the THF-solution-cast sample and the melt-cooled sample (refer to Fig. 3). In the case of the solution-cast sample, the peak increased in intensity above Tg, and then decreased gradually the intensity and disappeared at 170 °C. At the same time, a new peak started to appear and increased the intensity remarkably and disappeared totally above the melting point. In the case of the melt-cooled sample [Fig. 4 (b)], the peak intensity increased slightly during the heating (and cooling) processes and decreased steeply in the temperature region of 140–210 °C. In the cooling process from the melt, the behavior is almost reversible although the peak started to appear at around 190 °C. From all of these X-ray diffraction data including the temperature dependences, we can know the existence of the two types of crystal modifications for the TFE-VA alternating copolymer, which are named the α form for the melt-cooled sample and the β form for the solution cast film. As known from Figs. 1 and 3 (d) and 4 (a), the β form transforms to the α form at about 170 °C in the heating process, corresponding to the exothermic peak of the DSC thermogram [Fig. 1 (a) and (b)]. The α form shows almost reversible diffraction intensity change [Fig. 4 (b)], but, more strictly speaking, the behavior is different above and below 135 °C. In such a sense, the α phase might be classified into the two types; the high-temperature α phase (αHT) above 135 °C and the low-temperature α phase (αLT) below 135 °C. The crystalline phase transition may be summarized as shown below. 3.1.3 The 2D X-ray diffraction patterns Fig. 5 (a) shows the 2-dimensional X-ray diffraction pattern of the uniaxially-oriented αLT form at room temperature, which was prepared by stretching the melt-quenched film followed by heat treatment above 170 °C under tension. The 1st and second layer lines are quite diffuse and streaky along the horizontal directions, contrast to the equatorial line consisting of the sharp diffraction peaks. Fig. 5 (b) is the 2D X-ray diffraction pattern obtained for the THF-solution-cast and uniaxially-drawn film of β form after the heat treatment at 170 °C under tension. The layer lines consist of sharp peaks, highly contrast to the αLT form. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of the 2D X-ray diffraction pattern measured for the oriented and non-annealed β-form film (cast from the THF solution) in the heating process. The pattern itself was similar to that of the annealed β form (Fig. 5 (b)), but the diffraction peaks were diffuse at the starting point [(1)]. The diffraction pattern became clearer by heating up to 170 °C [(2, 3)]. The pattern at around 180 °C became the overlap of those of αΗΤ and β forms. It changed drastically to the pattern of the αHT near 200 °C [(4)] (refer to Figs. 3 and 4). In the cooling process, the pattern of the αHT phase was kept almost reversibly [(5) and (6)] and did not change to the pattern of the β form anymore. The several points of the X-ray diffraction patterns are different between the αLT and the β phase. One is about the highly sharp equatorial peaks of the αLT phase. The crystallite size (D) in the lateral direction, as evaluated from the half width (Δ1/2) of the 200/110 peak using the Scherrer's equation [D = 0.9λ/(Δ1/2cos(θ))] after the slit width correction using a standard aluminum powder, is about 10 nm for the β form and 600 nm for the αLT form. The latter size might be an overestimation, but the important point is that the crystallites of αLT form are overwhelmingly large in the lateral direction. (The similar structure is seen for the VDF-TrFE (trifluoroethylene) random copolymer of VDF75 mol% content. The remarkably large crystallites were created after heat treatment in the high-temperature phase, which is called the single-crystalline-like crystallites [33].) The αLT form is speculated to take a single domain structure of remarkably large size, whereas the β form might consist of the aggregation of the small crystallites (or mosaics). But, the packing disorder of chains is more drastic in the αLT form. In such a sense, the αLT form of the TFE-VA alternating copolymer is in the same situation as that revealed for poly(β-propiolactone) showing the remarkable streak lines and the sharp equatorial line [34]. In Fig. 6 (5) and (6), we compare the 2D X-ray diffraction patterns between the αLT (30 °C) and αHT (200 °C) phases. The pattern itself is similar between them, but the higher angle peaks are quite diffuse and weak in the αHT phase. The diffraction intensity is in proportion to the thermal factor exp(-Bsin2θ/λ2), where the 2θ is a Bragg angle and λ is an X-ray wavelength. Therefore, the acceleration of thermal motion of the chains results in the remarkable intensity reduction of the higher angle peaks [35]. If such a thermal activation of molecular motion is a reason for the different X-ray diffraction patterns between the αLT an αHT, the different names given to these two α forms are meaningless. However, the temperature dependence of the X-ray diffraction intensity (Fig. 4 (b)) and that of the IR band intensity, as will be described in a later section, cannot be ignored for reasoning why the different names are given to these two phases of αLT and αHT. 3.1.4 IR spectra and OH⋯F hydrogen bonds In order to clarify the structural features of these crystal modifications, it is better to know the relation between hydrophobic TFE units and hydrophilic VA units. The IR spectra may give us the information of interactions between these monomeric units. Fig. 7 shows the IR spectra measured for the αLT and β forms of TFE-VA alternating copolymer in comparison with those of TFE-VA random copolymer, PTFE and PVA homopolymers. A strong absorption peak detected in the frequency region of 3500 cm−1 is the band due to the stretching mode of the hydrogen-bonded OH groups [36]. When a free OH bond is linked with the other OH units, the H atom is pulled by these units and the O-H bond length becomes longer and the corresponding force constant is smaller, resulting in the lower frequency shift of the OH stretching band. In Fig. 7, the band is located at appreciably higher frequency (3500 cm−1) compared with the band of the pure PVA film (3400 cm−1). Another small peak is detected at around 3650 cm−1, which is assigned to the OH stretching mode of the hydrogen-bond-free OH groups. In the lower frequency region, the strong 1225 and 1160 cm−1 bands of PTFE homopolymer film are assigned to the CF stretching modes [37], which are shifted to the lower frequency side (1150–1100 cm−1) in the TFA-VA alternating copolymer. From these observations, we may assume that the C-F and O-H bonds are connected to each other through the hydrogen bonds of F⋯H-O type and O⋯H-O type [38,39]. Judging from the higher frequency position of the OH band compared with that of PVA, these hydrogen bonds are not very strong compared with those in PVA crystal. Besides the hydrogen-bonding-free OH groups are existent at a high population in the copolymer. When the hydrogen-bonded OH bands are compared between the αLT and β forms, as seen in Fig. 7, the OH band of the β form is detected at 3395 cm−1 and distributes toward the lower frequency side, while the corresponding band of the αLT form is located at 3440 cm−1 and the bandwidth is relatively narrower. This means that the hydrogen bonds in the β form are stronger than in the αLT form. At the same time, as known from the relative intensity of the 3650 cm−1 band, the population of the free OH groups is relatively higher in the αLT form than in the β form. By combining the IR data with the above-mentioned X-ray diffraction data, we may assume that the αLT form is structurally disordered, the hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, and many OH groups are not linked together through the hydrogen bonds. This situation is seen for the random copolymer also, as known from the similar IR spectral pattern. The β form is built up by the relatively stronger and more effective hydrogen bonds between TFE and VA units (F⋯HO) as well as between the VA units (O⋯HO). The temperature dependence of the IR spectra was measured for the αLT and β forms in the heating and cooling processes, as shown in Fig. 8 (In Ref. [29], the temperature-dependent IR spectra were reported, which correspond to those of the β form since the solution-cast film was used as the sample. The strongest bands in the frequency region of 1100–1000 cm−1 were saturated since the thick film was used in the experiment so that the relatively weak bands could be traced quantitatively. Refer to Fig. 7.). Starting from the β form [Fig. 8 (a)], the hydrogen-bonded OH stretching band shifted gradually to the higher frequency side as the temperature was increased, indicating the weakening of hydrogen bonds. At the same time, the relative intensity of this band decreased gradually. The IR band of the hydrogen-bond-free OH groups increased instead. The F⋯OH hydrogen bonds are considered to be relatively easily broken in the high temperature region. At around 170 °C or in the transition temperature region from the β to αΗΤ form, the free OH band intensity increased more remarkably. The weaker hydrogen bonds and higher content of the hydrogen-bond-free OH (and F) groups are characteristic of the αΗΤ form. The IR bands of the molten state above 200 °C appeared at the different peak positions from those of the β and αHT forms. Besides, the band of free OH groups is stronger than the hydrogen-bonded OH band. Fig. 8 (b) shows the spectral change in the cooling processes of the crystallization to the αHT form and the transformation to the αLT form. In these processes the hydrogen-bonded OH band increased in intensity and shifted toward the lower-frequency side. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) show the temperature dependence of the integrated intensity and peak position evaluated for the IR bands related to the hydrogen bonds. The numbers attached in these plots indicate the order of heating and cooling procedures. The plot was started from the β form (#1). The hydrogen-bonded OH band position gradually shifted toward the higher-frequency side [Fig. 9 (b)], and the band intensity decreased in parallel in 100–170 °C range [Fig. 9 (a)]. The band shifted discontinuously at 170–180 °C and rode on the curves of processes #2 and #3, indicating the transition to the αΗΤ form. In the cooling (#2) and re-heating (#3) processes, almost reversible change was detected. But, in both of the curves #2 and #3, the deflection was detected at around 135 °C, corresponding to the transformation between the αLT and αHT phases (see Figs. 1 and 4). We have to notice the existence of one characteristic peak at around 670 cm−1. This band is weaker in the β form, but becomes sharp and strong after the transition to the αΗΤ and αLT forms, as seen in Fig. 8. In the cooling process the band intensity became quite strong once when the αLT phase appeared. As will be described in a later section, the αLT form takes the trans zigzag chain conformation. The 668 cm−1 band is characteristic of the all-trans sequence of TFA-VA segments, which can be assigned to the bending and symmetric stretching mode of CF2 units coupled with the OH bending mode, as revealed by the normal modes calculation. (The calculation was performed using the density functional theory (DMol3) for a series of TFE-VA alternating copolymer chains with the different numbers of the monomeric units. The corresponding band was calculated to appear at 660 cm−1. The intensity became stronger as the number of TFE-VA units was increased.) When the zigzag chains are brought to the temperature region of the αHT phase, the band intensity decreased remarkably due to the thermally-activated fluctuation of trans-zigzag chain. In this way this band might be used as a measure of the deviation from the perfect zigzag conformation. In fact, the intensity of this band is weak for the β phase having the slightly contracted zigzag chain conformation, as will be revealed by the X-ray analysis. The 668 cm−1 band is considered to be intrinsic to the sequence of TFE-VA unit, and the intensity may increase as the length and regularity of trans-zigzag TFE-VA sequences are increased."
7,"Crystal structures of the αLT, αHT and β forms","3.2 Crystal structures of the αLT, αHT and β forms The crystal structures of the αLT, αHT and β forms are proposed here on the basis of the quantitative analysis using the 2D X-ray diffraction data shown in Fig. 5. From the peak positions of all the observed diffraction peaks, the following unit cell parameters were estimated. β form ( 25 o C ) a = 9.48 Å, b = 5.38 Å, c ( chain axis ) = 9.84 Å, α = β = γ = 90 o α LT form ( 25 o C ) a = 9.58 Å, b = 5.48 Å, c ( chain axis ) = 5.01 Å, α = β = γ = 90 o α HT form ( 170 o C ) a = 10.01 Å, b = 5.64 Å, c ( chain axis ) = 5.02 Å, α = β = γ = 90 o The ratio a/b = 1.75–1.77 indicates that these unit cells are approximately of the hexagonal lattice type. The repeating period or the c-axial length along the chain axis indicates the chain conformation of almost planar-zigzag type. The repeating period of a planar zigzag chain conformation calculated by assuming the standard C-C bond length (1.54 Å) and CCC bond angle (109.5°) is 5.03 Å for one unit [CF2CF2CH2CH(OH)]. This value is almost the same as that observed for the αLT and αHT forms. From the observed repeating period 9.84 Å, the β form seems to contain the two monomeric units in the repeating period, but the chain conformation is slightly contracted from the planar-zigzag form (5.03 × 2 = 10.06 Å). 3.2.1 The crystal structure of the β form As the initial model, the 2 planar-zigzag chains were packed in the unit cell. For the present alternating copolymer, the tacticity of the OH groups are atactic, or, they are randomly attached on the right and left sides of the zigzag chain. But, at the first stage of the analysis, the polymer chain of a regular configuration was assumed about the OH groups, i.e., the OH side groups are alternately attached along the zigzag chain, corresponding to the syndiotactic configuration. The planar-zigzag chains were packed in the unit cell in the various ways by assuming various space group symmetries. The thus-obtained structure models were energetically minimized and the calculated X-ray diffraction profiles were compared with the observed data. The energy minimization was performed using a commercial software Materials Studio (Biovia) with the COMPASS force filed [30]. The several models were found to reproduce the observed X-ray diffraction data relatively well. The molecular chains of the following conformations were some of these examples. - – CH2 – CF2 – CF2 – CH(OH) – CH2 – CF2 – CF2 – CH(OH) – CH2 (i) T T S T T T S ¯ T (ii) G T S T G ¯ T S ¯ T (iii) T S T T T S ¯ T T Here T, G and S are the internal rotation angles around the C-C bonds and trans (∼180°), gauche (∼60°) and skew (=120°), respectively. Among all the space group symmetries, the most plausible candidate was P21 cn, where the molecular chain takes the glide plane symmetry and deforms slightly from the zigzag conformation. It was found that these chain models were not necessarily geometrically reasonable. For example, in the conformation (i), C(F)-C(F) bond length was 1.68 Å and C(F)-C(OH) bond length was 1.70 Å, which are too long compared with the stereochemically normal length 1.54 Å. The CCC bond angles were 114° – 117°, too large compared with the standard tetrahedral angle 109.5°. This matter might come from the usage of the classical force field like COMPASS, because such a chemical sequence of C(F)-C(OH) is not found very popularly in the literatures, making the potential functional parameters less reliable. Then, the ab-initio quantum chemical calculation was performed using the density functional theory (DFT) in order to obtain the energetically and geometrically optimized structures (Dmol3, Biovia), in which the syndiotactic polymer chains were packed in the unit cell. The two types of chain conformation were obtained as the most stable forms. The bond lengths, bond angles and skeletal torsional angles are listed below. Image 1 When these two conformations are compared with one another, the gauche model has the anomalously large bond angles for the CH(OH)-CH2-CF2 and CH2-CF2-CF2. The gauche model was abandoned at this moment. For the skew model, the C(F)-C(F) bond length is 1.58 Å and CF-C(O) bond length is 1.58 Å. They are slightly longer than the standard value, but reasonable when the repulsion between the bulky side groups (CF2 and C-OH units) is taken into consideration. The similar situation is seen also for the bond angles, about 112–114° in these groups. The skeletal torsional angles are expressed approximately as the repetition of … S ¯ TTTSTTT S ¯ TTT …. The thus-derived local geometry of the stereochemically-reasonable syndiotactic chain model was transferred to the starting model for the X-ray diffraction data analysis. However, in the construction of the crystal structure, the OH groups of the VA monomeric units were attached to a C atom on the right and left sides at 50% probability because of the atactic chain configuration, where the chain conformation derived by the DFT calculation was reserved as a whole. The thus-obtained statistically-disordered atactic-chain conformation and the chain packing structure are shown in Fig. 10 for the space group P21 cn. The calculated X-ray diffraction profiles are shown in Fig. 11 . The crystallite parameters used in the calculation were as follows: the crystallite size 60 Å (//a), 60 Å (//b) and 60 Å (//c), the lattice strain 0.5% (//a), 0.5% (//b) and 0.5% (//c). The isotropic temperature factor was 10 Å2. The agreement of the X-ray diffraction profiles between the observed and calculated ones is relatively good. In addition to the crystal structure model shown in Fig. 10, we checked another possible models also. The crystal structure model of Fig. 10 is regular, and the OH groups are oriented to the same direction along the a axis, making the electrically polar unit cell. As another possibility, the nonpolar packing model was built, in which the molecular chains located at one lattice site direct oppositely along the a axis at 50% probability. However, such disordered model could not give a better reproduction of the observed X-ray diffraction profiles. As another different disorder model, the disorderliness of the upward and downward chains along the c axis was constructed. But, the observed diffraction data could not be reproduced still well. In this way, an introduction of chain packing disorderliness into the unit cell did not improve the degree of agreement between the observed and calculated X-ray diffraction profiles. Additionally, a crystallite was assumed to consist of domains, which are packed together in a disordered style. The details of the calculated results are presented in the Supporting Information. The conclusion is that even such a disordered domain model could not improve the reproduction of the observed X-ray diffraction data. In this way, we do not need to introduce any kind of structure disorderliness in the β form from the viewpoint of X-ray data analysis. The basic structure of the β form is that proposed in Fig. 10. The atomic fractional coordinates are shown in Table 1 . As a measure of the reproduction of the observed X-ray diffraction data, the R-factor is often used in the structure analysis, which is defined as R = Σ|I obs(hkl) – I calc(hkl)|/ΣI obs(hkl) where I(hkl) is an intensity of the hkl diffraction peak. However, in the present analysis, we did not evaluate the R-factor because the total number of the observed diffraction peaks was too small and peaks were appreciably diffuse as a whole. When we view the structures shown in Fig. 10, the F⋯O distances are 2.7–3.0 Å along the chain axis and 2.7–3.4 Å between the neighboring chains. These values are close to the F⋯O distances (2.6–3.4 Å) reported for the hydrogen-bonded pairs of F and OH units in the low-molecular-weight organic compounds [38,39]. In this way, the β form crystal forms the intra- and inter-molecular F⋯H-O (and O⋯H-O) hydrogen bonds, consistent with the IR spectroscopic data shown in the preceding section. 3.2.2 Crystal structure of the αLT and αHT forms As for the αLT form, an almost fully-extended planar-zigzag chain conformation is assumed as already mentioned. Since the right- and left-sided OH units are added on one C atom at 50% probability due to the atactic chain configuration, the planar-zigzag chain takes the averaged repeating period of 5.0 Å. This situation is similar to the case of atactic poly(vinyl alcohol) [40,41]. However, we might have such a curious feeling why the extended chain conformation must be assumed for the α form, in particular, in the αHT form. The αHT form is obtained by heating the β form of the skew form. The repeating period is not contracted but increased in a higher temperature region. The similar observation was reported about the chain conformation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the high temperature phase. As well known, the PTFE chain takes the (13/6) helical conformation (<19 °C) and (15/7) helical form (19 °C ∼ 30 °C) with the C-C torsional angles of 160° ∼ 170°: these helices are slightly contracted from the perfect trans-zigzag form (180°) because of the non-bonded F⋯F interatomic repulsion between the neighboring TFE units [42–52]. In the temperature region higher than 130 °C, the molecular chains experience the conformational disordering due to the active thermal motion. The averaged repeating period is almost equal to that of the trans-zigzag form. This image was supported by the IR spectral data, in which the infrared bands characteristic of the trans conformation were detected in the high temperature region [53,54]. The proposed model was that PTFE chains take the thermally-activated reversal motion between the right-handed and left-handed helical forms via the local TT form (soliton-like motion) [49,50]. The present αHT form may be in the similar situation. The trans-zigzag chain conformation is energetically stable as known from the energy calculation. The observation of increasing intensity of the 668 cm−1 band supports it (Fig. 9). Fig. 12 shows one model of the αLT form (a = 9.580 Å, b = 5.480 Å, c = 5.010 Å), in which the zigzag chains are packed with the statistical disorders of the chain orientations. Among the various possible space groups, the space group P2/c21/n2/n was found to give the best reproduction of the observed X-ray diffraction data. The comparison of the X-ray diffraction profiles between the observed and calculated results is made in Fig. 13 . The atomic fractional coordinates are listed in Table 2 . The hydrogen bonds of F⋯H-O and O⋯H-O types are possible in this case. At the same time, the relative population of not-hydrogen-bonded CF2 and OH groups is appreciably high, as seen in the IR spectra given in Fig. 7. The αHT form has essentially the same packing structure as that of the αLT form, although the unit cell parameters are a little larger than at room temperature. It must be noted again that the repeating period along the chain axis is of the trans-zigzag form for both of the low- and high-temperature phases. The thermally-activated zigzag chains are speculated to rotate drastically in the αHT phase. When the sample is cooled to the room temperature, the random molecular orientations around the chain axis are frozen in the αLT phase. As seen in the remarkable increase of the 668 cm−1 band intensity (Fig. 8), the molecular chains become straighter with narrower distribution of the torsional angles around the trans position (180°). The hydrogen-bond-free OH groups are existent at much higher population. 3.2.3 Phase transition scheme From all the results derived from the X-ray and IR data analyses, the structural features of the α and β crystal phases are extracted as follows. β form: This crystal phase is created only from the solution. The possibility of a polymer-solvent complex cannot be considered since no bands characteristic of the solvent molecules are detected in the IR spectra. The molecular chains are contracted slightly from the all-trans zigzag form by the skew bonds around the CF2-CF2 linkages. The OH groups are oriented along the a axis to form the polar crystal. The β phase is stable up to 170–180 °C, about 30 °C below the melting point. Once the β form transforms to the αHT form, the β form cannot be recovered anymore, indicating that the trans bonds cannot be brought back to the skew bonds anymore. The hydrogen bonds of F⋯H-O and O⋯H-O types are formed in the crystal lattice, the strength of which is higher than those of the αLT and αHT forms. α HT form: This phase is obtained by heating the β form (and αLT form) above 170 °C. The molecular chains take all-trans zigzag conformation. However, the thermal fluctuation of the torsional angles might occur radically, as estimated from the relatively weak 668 cm−1 IR band intensity, compared with that of the αLT phase. The X-ray diffraction pattern is diffuse in the higher 2θ range, indicating that the rotational and translational motions of the chains occur drastically. α LT form: When the αHT is cooled to the temperature region lower than 130 °C, the low-temperature α phase (αLT) is obtained reversibly, which does not transform to the β form anymore. The molecular chains of all-trans zigzag form are existent in the similar mode as that of the αHT form. But, the 668 cm−1 IR band is remarkably stronger than that of the high-temperature α form, indicating the thermal fluctuation around the C-C bonds is ceased and the zigzag segmental length becomes much longer. The X-ray diffraction peaks on the equatorial line are quite sharp but the layer lines are still diffuse. The packing mode of the zigzag chains is disordered, but the X-ray coherent crystallite size may be quite large in the lateral direction. The relative height disordering along the chain axis might be remained still. Fig. 14 illustrates the transition scheme among these 3 crystalline phases, in which the arrows of the α form symbolize the dipoles (COH and CF bonds) of the planar zigzag chains. The blue fans in the β form are given to represent the projected chain structure having the skew bonds. The reason why we have these crystal modifications having the slightly different regularities in chain conformation and chain packing structure cannot be clarified at present, which should be an important future theme."
8,Comparison between the alternating and random copolymers,"3.3 Comparison between the alternating and random copolymers As a counterpart of the alternating copolymer of TFE and VA monomeric units, it may be useful to reveal the structure of the random copolymer and compare it with that of the alternating copolymer for clarifying an effect of sequential regularity of monomeric units on the structure. Fig. 15 (a) shows the 2D X-ray diffraction pattern measured for the uniaxially-oriented random copolymer sample. The indexing of the observed diffraction peaks gave the following orthogonal unit cell of the hexagonal type; a = 9.54 Å, b = 5.44 Å, c ( chain axis ) = 2.52 Å The a and b values are almost the same as those of the alternating copolymer, in particular, of the αLT form. The observed repeating period 2.52 Å along the chain axis is a half of that predicted for the planar-zigzag chain conformation consisting of the alternate array of TFE and VA units. The random array of the TFE and VA units along the chain axis gives the repeating period 2.5 Å, where the upward and downward orientations of the VA units might be random and the OH groups are attached also randomly on the right and left side of the zigzag plane. When the diffraction pattern was investigated carefully, a quite weak meridional diffraction peak was detected between the equatorial line and the first layer line, suggesting a slight deviation from such a perfect randomization of the two monomeric units. In the actual X-ray structure analysis, we used the totally-randomized zigzag chain conformation for simplicity: all the C atoms possess the same side groups in average, CH2+CF2+CH(OH) with the probabilities of F (50%), OH (25%) and H (25%). Fig. 16 shows the thus-constructed crystal structure model of TFE-VA random copolymer. The space group is assumed to be Cn11. The chains are packed in the herringbone mode, similar to that of the orthorhombic polyethylene. The calculated X-ray diffraction profiles on the equatorial and first layer lines are compared with the observed ones in Fig. 15 (b). The calculated 2D X-ray diffraction pattern is compared with the observed pattern in Fig. 15 (a). The atomic fractional coordinates are shown in Table 3 . The crystal structure is similar to that of the αLT form. As seen in Fig. 7, the IR band at 668 cm−1 is relatively weak for the random copolymer, since the TFE and VA monomeric units are randomly arranged along the polymer chain and the regular TFE-VA sequential length is not very long compared with the alternating copolymer, although the chain conformation itself is of the trans-zigzag form. The temperature dependence of the X-ray diffraction pattern was measured for the uniaxially-oriented TFE-VA random copolymer sample during heating to the melting point (202 °C). As shown in the Supplementary data 2, the whole pattern did not change mostly although the diffuseness of the layer line was more remarkable at a higher temperature, suggesting the higher disordering in the relative height of the neighboring chains. Finally the IR spectrum of the random copolymer is compared with that of the alternating copolymer in Fig. 7. The spectral pattern in the OH stretching region is very similar to that of the αLT form, indicating the similarity in the hydrogen bond strength and also in the population ratio between the hydrogen-bonded OH groups and the free OH groups. But, the 668 cm−1 band is not very strong compared with that of the αLT form. Finally, the structure of ethylene (E)-vinyl alcohol random copolymer is compared with that of the present TFE-VA random copolymer [55]. Both of the copolymers take the all-trans zigzag chain conformation. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between OH groups of VA units in the E-VA random copolymer, while the hydrogen bonds are formed F⋯HO and O⋯HO groups in the TFE-VA random copolymer. In both cases, the population of hydrogen-bond-free OH groups increases compared with those seen in PVA crystal. It is now difficult to compare the structural change between these two types of random copolymers, since we do not have a series of TFE-VA random copolymer with various TFE/VA content, different from the case of E/VA random copolymer [55]."
9,Conclusions,"The structures and phase transition behavior of the novel TFE-VA alternating copolymer have been investigated in detail on the basis of the X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopic data in addition to the thermal data. The chain conformation of the β form, TTTSTTT S ( − ) , is a little contracted from the zigzag form of the αLT form, TTTT. This conformational difference is mainly originated from the sensitive change of the torsional angle around the CF2-CF2 bonds. The chain packing structure is relatively regular in the β form, which is highly contrast to the disordered structure of the αLT form. One of the most characteristic interatomic interactions is the formation of the F⋯HO (and O⋯HO) hydrogen bonds along the chain axis and between the neighboring chains. The hydrophobic TFE units and the hydrophilic VA units are arranged side-by-side in the unit cell with the close packing mode. The OH groups are not necessarily hydrogen bonded at 100% probability with the F and OH groups, but the hydrogen-bond-free OH groups are also existent at relatively high ratio. In such a sense the situation is similar to the case of ethylene-vinyl alcohol random copolymers. In the present study only the crystal structure and the phase transition behavior have been investigated in detail. But we need to know, as a future work, how these crystalline characteristics affect the physical properties of this novel alternating copolymer between hydrophobic TFE and hydrophilic VA units."
