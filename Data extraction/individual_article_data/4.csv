0,Introduction,"The consumption of chemical fuels causes severe energy problems, so it is essential to find a clean and renewable energy source [1,2]. In recent years, photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production by water splitting has been considered to be an effective strategy to solve the energy crisis [3,4]. However, most researches focus on the half-reaction of H2 production, which consumes holes by adding lactic acid, triethanolamine or other hole scavengers to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 production [5–7]. This half-reaction system containing sacrificial agent wastes a lot of holes, and owing to the toxicity and expensiveness of sacrificial agent, it limits the overall catalytic reaction process and is not environmentally friendly [8–10]. Photocatalytic H2 production coupled with organic oxidation not only replaces toxic sacrificial agents, but also avoids the waste of holes, which is of great significance to obtain two products with high-added-value simultaneously [11]. For example, Jiang et al. first reported the photocatalytic H2 production coupled with selective benzylamine oxidation over MOF composites by replacing the sacrificial agent with benzylamine organics to obtain two interesting products, H2 and N-benzylbenzaldimine [8]. Since carbonyl derivatives have an extensive application prosperity in industry and laboratories, the selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes is a predominant commercial and laboratory procedure [12–14]. The reaction will be promoted with carbocationic species owing to the activation of photo-generated holes [8,15]. Therefore, it is possible to simultaneously realize the photoreduction of hydrogen protons and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols in a redox cycle with inert atmosphere over photocatalysts, producing two high value-added products of solar fuel (H2) and solar chemicals (benzaldehydes). Unfortunately, the reports related with coupling reaction remain relatively less. Among various reported semiconductors, cadmium sulfide (CdS) is regarded as an excellent candidate for H2 production due to its suitable conduction band position and good ability with visible light absorption [7,16–19]. Regrettably, the bare CdS particles are prone to agglomeration, rapid recombination of carriers, and the limitation of catalytic active sites, resulting in low overall photocatalytic activity. Although numerous endeavors have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of CdS, including adjusting the morphology of CdS [19] and combining with other materials to form composites, such as semiconductors [16], precious metals [17], and porous materials [7], the design of an efficient CdS-based photocatalyst still has great potential challenge. As a classic crystalline porous material, the metal–organic framework (MOFs) has the advantages of tailorable structure, high specific surface area, and strong adsorption capacity [20,21], which makes it widely used in many fields, especially in catalysis [22–26]. Among the diverse MOFs, the Fe-based MOF has attracted widespread attention because iron is one of the most abundant elements on the earth, and iron-containing complexes are often utilized in photocatalysis [27]. MIL-53(Fe), emerging as a typical Fe-based MOF, is responsive to visible light owing to the existence of Fe-O clusters [28–30]. The MIL-53(Fe)-based photocatalyst has been already reported for photocatalytic dye degradation or selective organic conversion. Han et al. [31] prepared AgI/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst to improve photocatalytic property of Rhodamine B degradation. Lei et al. [32] described that the MIL-53(Fe)-graphene nanocomposites can efficiently and selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol under visible light. Therefore, it is very promising to construct MOF-based composites based on MIL-53(Fe) to improve the overall photocatalytic activity with visible-light-driven. With a view towards the development of high-efficiency photocatalysts, we fabricated composites of CdS particles-decorated MOF, named CdS/MIL-53(Fe), which realized the coupling reaction of photocatalytic H2 production and benzyl alcohol oxidation into benzaldehyde, in the absence of sacrificial agents, under visible light. This system combines the advantages of CdS and MOF while escaping the defects of individual components, and takes full advantage of electrons and holes to complete an overall redox cycle. The CdS/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst adopts the Z-scheme transfer type, which greatly shortens the charge transfer path and improves the separation efficiency of the charge, thereby achieving efficient coupling performance of H2 production and benzyl alcohol oxidation, and obtaining two high value-added products. Although MOF-based materials enable photocatalytic H2O2 production coupled with benzyl alcohol oxidation [33,34], to our knowledge, the oxidation–reduction cycle of photocatalytic H2 production coupled with the alcohol oxidation over MOF-based photocatalysts is still very rare."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of MIL-53(Fe),"2.1 Synthesis of MIL-53(Fe) The synthesis of MIL-53(Fe) was prepared by simple solvothermal methods with reference to the literature [35]. In the traditional procedure, 1 mmol ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 0.270 g) and 1 mmol terephthalic acid (1,4-BDC, 0.166 g) were dispersed in 5 mL N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and magnetic stirring for 30 min. After stirring to a clear solution, transferred to a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, keep the temperature at 150 ℃ for 12 h in an oven. After a period of natural cooling, the obtained sample was centrifuged and washed with DMF, methanol and deionized water several times. Finally, the white-yellow MIL-53(Fe) powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 ℃."
3,Synthesis of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst Typically, 50 mg of the as-synthesized MIL-53(Fe) was dispersed in 10 mL of ethylene glycol solution and sonicated for 20 min. In addition, 0.3 mmol of chromium nitrate dihydrate (Cd (COOH)2·2H2O) and 0.3 mmol of thiourea were pre-dissolved in 10 mL of ethylene glycol solution. Subsequently, the two solutions were mixed together with ultrasonic and stirred for approximately 1 h. After the solution became homogeneous, the suspension was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave with a solvothermal method for 15 h at 150 ℃. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged and washed several times with an ethanol–water mixture. Then, the final photocatalyst was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 ℃ for 12 h. Pure CdS particles were synthesized in the absence of MIL-53(Fe)."
4,Electrochemical characterization,"2.3 Electrochemical characterization The working electrode was prepared by dripping 50 μL of suspension and coating it on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surface of 1 cm2 area. The suspension was prepared by ultrasonically mixing 5 mg of samples and 1 mL of ethanol. All electrochemical characterizations were tested by the Zahner Instruments electrochemical workstation with three-electrode cell, including counter electrode (Pt plate) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl). The test was completed at room temperature with 0.2 M Na2SO4."
5,Photocatalytic test,"2.4 Photocatalytic test The photocatalytic H2 production coupled with benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction was carried out in a 200 mL photocatalytic reactor. Dispersed 5 mg of the catalyst into 5 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile and 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol solution. The suspension was evacuated in the photocatalytic reactor and filled with argon to remove the air, followed by a 300 W Xenon lamp visible light irradiation equipped with cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). The Agilent 7820 A gas chromatograph (GC) was used to detect the production of H2, and the GC system (Agilent 7890 A) with flame ionization detector (FID) was used to detect the products of benzyl alcohol conversion."
6,Result and discussion,
7,Characterization of structure and morphology,"3.1 Characterization of structure and morphology The CdS/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst was synthesized in two steps by a straightforward solvothermal method (Scheme 1 ). First, Fe3+ and 1,4-BDC were coordinated under solvothermal conditions to form the porous framework material - MIL-53(Fe). Subsequently, during the solvothermal process in the presence of ethylene glycol, thiourea would create S2- ions of negatively charged, which may be closely adsorbed on the surface of MIL-53(Fe) with positively charged owing to the electrostatic interaction [27,35]. Meanwhile, the Cd2+ in the solution would combine with the S2- ions adsorbed to form CdS particles, thereby obtaining CdS/MOF composites of CdS particles-decorated MIL-53(Fe). The crystallinity of the samples was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). As can be seen from Fig. 1 a, the diffraction peaks of the synthesized MIL-53(Fe) are highly consistent with the simulated MIL-53(Fe), indicating that the MIL-53(Fe) was successfully obtained. In Fig. 1b, the diffraction peaks of pure CdS particles are consistent with the PDF card (JCPDS NO.10–0454) of CdS. When CdS particles were successfully decorated on MIL-53(Fe), we found that the XRD contained both CdS and MOF peaks. However, the MOF peaks are slightly shifted, which is probably because a large number of CdS or some Cd ions occupy some interstitial sites and replace part of the Fe element [36,37]. Moreover, no other impurity peaks were detected, indicating that we obtained a high-purity of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites. The contents of Fe and Cd in CdS/MIL-53(Fe) were 9.56% and 34.7%, respectively, by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement. The morphology of the samples was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the absence of MOF, the CdS particles are formed with average particle size of about 480 nm and easily agglomerate together (Fig. 2 a). The MIL-53(Fe) presents a block-shaped without any adhesion on the surface (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d present the morphology of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites. It can be seen that the smaller sized CdS particles (210 nm of average particle size) were decorated onto the surface of MIL-53(Fe) with good dispersibility, indicating that the CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites were successful obtained and the MOF plays an important role in controlling the small-sized CdS particles. To detect the functional groups present in the samples, the FT-IR spectra of CdS, MIL-53(Fe) and CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites are shown in Fig. S1. The absorption peak at 524 cm−1 corresponds to the traditional vibration band of Fe-O, indicating that a metal–oxygen bond is formed between the carboxylic group in the terephthalic acid and Fe3+ [38,39]. The characteristic peak at 746 cm−1 is attributed to the vibration of the C-N bond of the benzene rings [40]. In addition, the two sharp peaks of 1375 cm−1 and 1527 cm−1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetrical vibrations of C-O, respectively, indicating the existence of dicarboxylate linker in the sample [39]. In view of the infrared spectrum of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites, a small peak at 645 cm−1 is ascribed to Cd-S bond [41], and the absorption peaks of MIL-53(Fe) also exist, which further shows that CdS particles are successfully decorated onto MIL −53(Fe)."
8,Photocatalytic properties of samples,"3.2 Photocatalytic properties of samples The photocatalytic coupling reaction was carried out under visible light (λ > 420 nm). In order to take full advantage of the electrons and holes, organic substrate of benzyl alcohol was used instead of sacrificial agent to realize the photocatalytic overall redox reaction. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the photocatalyst generates a large number of electron-hole pairs and separates them with the irradiation of visible light. The holes oxidize benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, while the electrons reduce the hydrogen protons to H2, obtaining two high value-added production. Among them, 1 mmol of benzyl alcohol will be oxidized by holes to produce 1 mmol of benzaldehyde and release two hydrogen protons, which will be reduced by electrons to produce 1 mmol H2. The theoretical ratio of H2 to benzaldehyde should be 1:1 [42]. The photocatalysis of different catalysts was performed under the same reaction conditions, including 5 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile and 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 3b). The CdS/MIL-53(Fe) exhibits excellent H2 production rate of 2334 μmol g-1h−1 and high yield of 2825 μmol g-1h−1 as well as a high selectivity (99%) for benzaldehyde due to the better formation of fine CdS particles on the surface of MIL-53(Fe). Thereinto, the ratio of H2 to benzaldehyde is different from the ideal ratio (1:1), which might be because of the porous nature of MOF storing part of the hydrogen but not fully releasing it, resulting in slightly lower hydrogen than benzaldehyde [43]. With pure CdS particles, only a small amount of H2 (216 μmol g-1h−1) and benzaldehyde (176 μmol g-1h−1) were detected, which is much lower than CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites. The ratio of H2 to benzaldehyde over CdS is > 1:1, this is probably because other carbonyl compounds produced at this concentration of benzyl alcohol will compete with benzaldehyde as oxidation products [42]. In addition, the single-component MOF also performs poorly in this photocatalytic coupling system. MIL-53(Fe) exhibits a trace H2 production of 4 μmol g-1h−1, which is far less than 569 times that of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites. The yield of benzaldehyde reached 65 μmol g-1h−1, further indicating that MOF has certain hydrogen storage properties. In the absence of a catalyst, the substrate (benzyl alcohol) does not produce any gas (H2) and liquid (benzaldehyde) products under visible light irradiation. Replacing benzyl alcohol with a sacrificial agent (triethanolamine), still no H2 was detected, indicating that the source of the hydrogen protons was indeed from benzyl alcohol. According to this result together with the theoretical analysis described above, benzyl alcohol oxidation is the rate-determining step that plays a decisive role. Because of the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, only when benzyl alcohol is oxidized to remove the hydrogen protons, it is possible for electrons to reduce H+ into H2. The benzyl alcohol provides the source of hydrogen protons. Without the involvement of benzyl alcohol, there is no way to produce H2, which further proves that benzyl alcohol oxidation is the rate-determining step. In order to further illustrate the importance of photocatalyst, the performance of CdS + MIL-53(Fe) mechanical and physical mixing was studied. Only 62 μmol g-1h−1 of H2 and 309 μmol g-1h−1 of benzaldehyde were detected, which photocatalytic activity is significantly worse than that of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites. The result indicates that there is an interaction between CdS and MIL-53(Fe) in the CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites, rather than a simple physical contact. In contrast to similar work previously reported (Table S1) [42,44–47], CdS/MIL-53(Fe) stands out in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, the XRD peaks and FTIR spectra of the CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites are basically still present after the reaction, indicating the recyclability of the catalyst (Fig. S2). To investigate the effect of CdS content on photocatalytic activity in CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites, different ratios of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) were prepared. The results showed that the content of CdS has a certain effect on photocatalytic activity (Table S2). With the increase of CdS content, the photocatalytic activity is improved. The complete utilization of photogenerated charge carriers to exert excellent redox ability for different types of coupling reactions has a wide range of prospects [48–50]. As an excellent catalyst, the CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites helped us to explore the coupling reactions of some other alcohols (Table S3). The catalytic results show that our catalysts are also effective for other alcohols, expanding the application of our photocatalyst. However, the coupling activity is not as good as that of benzyl alcohol."
9,Mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production coupled with benzyl alcohol oxidation,"3.3 Mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production coupled with benzyl alcohol oxidation In order to explain that CdS/MIL-53(Fe) has much higher photocatalytic activity than other single components, it is believed that the efficiency of charge separation would be of importance [51,52]. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy shows that CdS/MIL-53(Fe) has the weakest fluorescence intensity, while the fluorescence intensity of MIL-53(Fe) is the strongest (Fig. 4 a), reflecting that the order of charge transfer efficiency for samples from fast to slow is CdS/MIL-53(Fe) > CdS > MIL-53(Fe), which corresponds to the photocatalytic activity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for CdS/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst exhibits a smaller arc radius and lower resistance in charge transport than a single CdS (Fig. 4b), indicating that the combination of CdS particles and MOF can effectively improve the carriers transport efficiency. Moreover, photocurrent test was carried out with irradiation of visible light (λ > 420 nm) (Fig. 4c), which result shows that CdS/MIL-53(Fe) produces a highest photocurrent response than the other two single components. Therefore, CdS/MIL-53(Fe) possesses a higher charge-separation efficiency and plays an irreplaceable role in the coupling reaction of photocatalytic H2 production and benzyl alcohol oxidation. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of CdS, MIL-53(Fe) and CdS/MIL-53(Fe) composites are shown in Fig. S3. When CdS particles are decorated on MIL-53(Fe), the absorption spectrum produces a red-shift in the visible light region compared to CdS and a single MOF, which provides a greater possibility for visible-light-driven photocatalytic coupling reaction. In order to further verify the transfer of electron-hole pairs, the positions of conduction band (LUMO) and valence band (HOMO) of CdS and MIL-53(Fe) were characterized by Mott-Schottky and Tauc plot. The Mott-Schottky plots were measured at the frequency of 500 Hz (Fig. 5 a). It can be found that the slopes of CdS and MIL-53(Fe) are both positive, which are proved to be n-type semiconductors. The flat band positions of CdS and MIL-53(Fe) determined from the intersection are −0.98 and −0.69 V vs. Ag/AgCl (−0.78 and −0.49 V vs. NHE, respectively), which close to the bottom of LUMO for n-type semiconductors. According to the Tauc plot (Fig. 5b), the band gaps of CdS and MIL-53(Fe) are estimated to be 2.54 and 2.98 eV, and then their HOMO is calculated to be 1.76 and 2.49 V vs. NHE, respectively. Such an unambiguous energy-band structure in photocatalyst helps us to further study the e-h transfer mechanism. Based on the above data analysis, our catalytic system is more in line with the Z-scheme transfer mechanism in the photocatalysis of photocatalytic H2 production coupled with benzyl alcohol oxidation. As shown in Fig. 6 , under the excitation of visible light, the electrons in the photocatalyst are excited to transition from the HOMO to the LUMO, and photogenerated electrons and holes are formed in the LUMO and HOMO, respectively. Assuming that electrons are transferred from CdS with more negative LUMO to MIL-53(Fe) and holes are transferred from MIL-53(Fe) with more positive HOMO to CdS, then reduction and oxidation reactions will occur on MIL-53(Fe) and CdS, respectively. However, it is difficult for benzyl alcohol to be oxidized into benzaldehyde by holes according to the redox potential of benzyl alcohol (+1.98 V vs. NHE). From the actual photocatalytic results, the redox ability of CdS/MIL-53(Fe) is much excellent, which is contradictory to the previous assumption. In view of the fact that CdS is often used as a candidate catalyst for hydrogen production, which has strong electron reduction ability [9,19,53]. The MOF of MIL-53(Fe) was used for the benzyl alcohol oxidation owing to good adsorption and oxidizing ability for organic substrates [32,54]. Therefore, the reduction reaction on CdS and the oxidation on MIL-53(Fe) are more reliable. In other words, our photocatalytic process is highly consistent with the Z-scheme transfer mechanism. Z-scheme transfer, that is, the holes in HOMO of CdS and the electrons in LUMO of MIL-53(Fe) preferentially recombine, so that a large amount of electrons accumulated in the LUMO of CdS reduce the H+ into H2, and the holes accumulated in the HOMO of MIL-53(Fe) oxidize the benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, and two meaningful products are obtained at the same time. In addition, the oxidation potential of benzaldehyde is + 2.5 eV vs. NHE [55], and our system is very difficult to further oxidize benzaldehyde. Thus, our reaction has the high selectivity. The advantage of this transfer mechanism is that the charge transport path is greatly shortened, the electron-hole pairs separation efficiency is accelerated, which leads to an improvement in photocatalytic activity."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully decorated the surface of MIL-53(Fe) with fine CdS particles, and demonstrated an interesting strategy for the integration of photocatalytic H2 production coupled with selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over CdS/MOF composites under visible light irradiation, without the need for a sacrificial agent. The photogenerated electrons reduce the hydrogen protons into H2, and the organic substrate of benzyl alcohol is oxidized into benzaldehyde with the help of holes. Thereby, two high value-added products were obtained, which can be separated spontaneously because the products are in the gas phase and in the solution, respectively. CdS/MIL-53(Fe) produces high-yield photocatalytic products, far surpassing the CdS and MIL-53(Fe) counterparts. This is due to the Z-scheme transfer mechanism of internal electrons, which greatly promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs. This work not only provides an effective solution strategy for the half-reaction of slow dynamics, but also provides insights for the fabrication and mechanism research of advanced composite photocatalysts in the future."
