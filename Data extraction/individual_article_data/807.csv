0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is regarded as one of the most promising energies of the future due to its non-polluting and high heating value. Production of hydrogen using renewable biomass sources (like agricultural wastes or other waste streams) offers the possibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand the route of hydrogen production. Several promising approaches have been developed to produce bio-hydrogen, such as the gasification of biomass, the SR of biomass-derived oxygenates (like bio-oil, glycerol, polyols, alcohols, sugars, organic acids) and the supercritical water partial oxidative of biomass [1–3]. Two representative technologies, the biomass gasification [4] and the SR of biomass-derived oxygenates [5,6], have been widely investigated for producing renewable bio-hydrogen. Biomass gasification can produce hydrogen-containing syngas, typically operating in a gasifier at temperature above 800 °C in the presence of oxygen or water [7–9]. Under these conditions, biomass undergoes partial oxidation and the SR reactions, yielding bio-syngas (mainly including H2, CO, CO2 and CH4), tar, char and other by-products. Generally, the biomass gasification efficiency, hydrogen yield and products distribution depend on the types of biomass feedstocks and gasifiers, gasifying agents and operating temperatures. The two major obstacles in the biomass gasification process, the formation of tar and complex gas mixtures that cause the decrease in the hydrogen content and the problem of the products separation, remain to be overcome. Alternatively, the SR of biomass-derived oxygenates (like bio-oil) can efficiently produce bio-hydrogen with high hydrogen yield and hydrogen content in gas products, which combined the SR of organics to H2 and CO with the WGS reaction to H2 and CO2 [10,11]. This process was typically conducted under medium temperature (500–800 °C) and atmospheric pressure using transition metal catalysts (especially Ni-based catalysts) or noble metal catalysts [12–14]. One of the major problems for the catalytic reforming of biomass-derived oxygenates is the deactivation of catalysts due to the deposition of coke [15,16]. Adding rare earth oxide into the Ni-based reforming catalysts or co-feeding bio-oil with methanol can partly improve the catalyst stability and prevent the deactivation of the catalyst in processes of the SR of biomass-derived oxygenates [17]. For production of pure hydrogen, another hindering is that the gas products generally contain CH4, CO, CO2 and other gaseous compounds, leading to the difficulty of hydrogen purification and the increase in the cost. In our previous work, a low-temperature electrochemical catalytic reforming method for efficient production of hydrogen using bio-oil was investigated [18,19]. It is well known that lignocellulosic biomasses mainly contain three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Yang, et al. compared the pyrolysis characteristics of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin by TGA, FTIR and GC [20]. They found that the pyrolysis behaviors of three components were quite different. Hemicellulose is easy to be degraded in the lower temperature range of 220–315 °C. The pyrolysis of cellulose mainly occurs in the range of 315–400 °C, while that of lignin covers a wide temperature range (150–900 °C). At low temperatures (<500 °C), the pyrolysis of hemicellulose and lignin involves the exothermic reactions but that of cellulose is an endothermic process. The main gas products obtained from the pyrolysis of three components included H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and other organics. Among three main components, lignin present the highest yield of hydrogen (4.2 gH2/100 glignin). More recently, Wu et al. investigated the production of hydrogen from the components of biomass by using a two-stage fixed bed pyrolysis/gasification reaction system [21]. They reported that cellulose produced the highest yield of hydrogen (1.2 gH2/100 gcellulose) in the absence of steam and catalyst, but only 0.4 gH2/100 glignin was obtained for lignin. The introduction of Ni-based catalyst significantly improved the hydrogen production, and the yield of hydrogen was increased from 1.4 to 3.7 gH2/100 glignin in the presence of the NiZnAl catalyst. However, a large amount of by-products such as CO and solid residue were observed during the pyrolysis/gasification process. Highest CO concentration of 44.4 vol% was found for the cellulose pyrolysis/gasification, and the residue from that of lignin reached 52 wt%. Lignocellulose is a sustainable feedstock for the hydrogen production as it is non-edible and abundant across most areas of the world. Extensive studies have shown that the hydrogen yield from biomass strongly depends on biomass feedstocks, reforming catalysts, reaction temperature, steam/biomass (S/B) ratio and reactor design [22–26]. Nickel-based catalysts, including Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and metals (like Mg, Cu) modified-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, have been commonly used to increase hydrogen production and reduce tar production in the catalytic steam gasification/reforming of biomass, due to their effective catalytic performance and the comparative low cost [22–26]. For example, Arregi et al. reported that a maximum H2 yield of 117 g per kg of biomass was obtained from the reforming pine wood sawdust over 14% NiO supported on Al2O3 at 600 °C with S/B ratio of 4 [27]. However, there are two problems that still remains a big challenge and requires further research efforts. As mention above, a large amount of CO by-product is inevitably generated during the production hydrogen by means of the gasification, SR or pyrolysis/gasification of biomass, which not only greatly reduces the yield of hydrogen but also goes against the gas purification for the production of high-pure hydrogen. Catalyst deactivation caused by the carbon deposition on catalysts also stood as another main problem for the production hydrogen through the SR of biomass. Accordingly, this work aimed to demonstrate a catalytic integrated process for the efficient production of high-pure hydrogen using different lignocellulosic biomasses and three major components of biomass. Almost all of carbon-containing species were effectively converted to H2 and CO2 via coupling the SR with the WGS reaction. High yield and purity of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomasses and three components were proved, and their real hydrogen yields obtained from the catalytic integrated process are close to the theoretical values."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The biomass of rice husk, sawdust and sugarcane bagasse was obtained from Anhui Yineng Bio-energy Co. Ltd (Hefei, China), the biomass components of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses were purchased from Hefei Lanxu Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Hefei, China). Main ultimate analyses of the feedstocks are present in Table 1 . All analytical reagents used were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company Limited (Shanghai, China)."
3,Catalysts,"2.2 Catalysts The NiLaTiAl catalyst used for the SR reaction was prepared by the impregnation method [19]. For the preparation of TiO2-γAl2O3 support, the solution containing tetra-n-butyl-titanate, cyclohexane, deionized water and aqueous ethanol was prepared. The volume ratio of tetra-n-butyl-titanate, cyclohexane, deionized water and aqueous ethanol was 2:1:10:20. A certain amount of dried γ-Al2O3 powder was added to the solution with the Ti/Al molar ratio of 1:3, followed by agitation at 40 °C for 12 h. After drying at 110 °C for 24 h, TiO2-γAl2O3 support was calcined in air at 650 °C for 5 h. Then, the NiLaTiAl catalyst was synthesized via the incipient wetness technique by using TiO2-γAl2O3 as a support. Prior to Ni loading, the support was modified with La by impregnation with an aqueous solution of La(NO3)3·6H2O. The La-modified support was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and calcined in air at 700 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, Ni was added by impregnation with Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. After drying at 110 °C for 24 h, the precipitate was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. The final catalyst composition contained 27.1 wt% Ni, 3.2 wt% La, 7.0 wt% Ti and 60.9 wt% Al in mass percent. The CuZnAl catalyst used for the WGS reaction was prepared by co-precipitation method [28,29]. Briefly, the preparation mainly included the following steps: (1) the preparation of respective metal nitrates solution with a settled molar ratio; (2) the preparation of a mixture of NaOH (1 M) and Na2CO3 (1 M) as precipitants; (3) the preparation of precipitates by the co-precipitation of respective metal nitrates solution with the precipitators at 80 °C; (4) the precipitates was aged for 12 h at 25 °C, washed until pH = 7, and then dried at 110 °C overnight; (5) the precipitates were finally calcined at 550 °C for 6 h to obtain the corresponding composite metal oxide catalyst; (6) The catalyst powder was made into granules with 40–60 mesh sizes. For the characterization of the catalysts, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on an X’pert Pro Philips diffractrometer (Philips, Netherlands), the elemental analysis was carried out by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (Thermo Jarrell Ash Corporation, USA) [30]. The BET surface area and pore volume of the catalysts were determined by the N2 physisorption method at −196 °C using a COULTER SA 3100 analyzer. The TPO analyses were conducted with a Q5000IR thermogravimetric analyzer (USA). Main properties of the catalysts were present in Table A.1 in Supporting Information."
4,Procedures for production of high-pure hydrogen from biomass,"2.3 Procedures for production of high-pure hydrogen from biomass As shown in Fig. 1 , an integrated catalytic process for production of high-pure hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomasses or three major components were designed under atmospheric pressure. The system consists of three units: the SR of biomass (Unit 1), the WGS (Unit 2) and the CO2 removal (Unit 3). Firstly, production of rich-hydrogen gases through the SR of biomass over the NiLaTiAl catalyst was performed in the SR reactor (Unit 1). The steam was used as the carrier gas, controlled by a mass flow controller for adjusting the steam/biomass (S/B) ratio. Secondly, the WGS reaction for the conversion of CO to H2 and CO2 was conducted in the Unit 2 over the CuZnAl catalyst. In the case of coupling the SR and WGS, the off-gas from the SR reactor was fed into the WGS reactor. Finally, CO2 in the gas products was removed by the CO2 adsorbents in the Unit 3. Generally, the SR of biomass was carried out under the following reaction conditions: 500–800 °C, the S/B ratio of 10, and the weight ratio of 5:1 between catalyst and biomass. The WGS reaction was run under the following reaction conditions: 250 °C, the S/B ratio of 10, and the weight ratio of 5:1 between catalyst and biomass. The gas products were on-line detected or off-line analyzed for the collected gas by the bags, using a gas chromatograph (GC-SP6890, Shandong, China). The gas chromatograph equipped with two detectors: a TCD for analysis of H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 separated on TDX-01 column and a FID for gas hydrocarbons separated on Porapak Q column. The moles of the gas products were determined by the normalization method with standard gases. To evaluate the hydrogen production from biomass, the hydrogen yield was generally calculated by the mass percent between hydrogen and biomass feedstock fed [27,31]. The hydrogen yield, theoretical hydrogen yield, the overall yields of gases, liquid and solid, the gas composition were calculated based on Eqs. (1)–(6). All the tests were repeated three times and the reported data are the mean values of three trials. (1) H 2 yield = mass of hydrogen mass of biomass (2) Theoretical H 2 yield = maximum mass of hydrogen allowed by stoichionmetry mass of biomass (3) Gas yield = mass of gas produced mass of biomass (4) Liquid yield = mass of liquid produced mass of biomass (5) Solid yield = mass of solid produced mass of biomass (6) Gas composition = mole of single gas product total moles of gas products"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of temperature on production of hydrogen from biomass,"3.1 Effect of temperature on production of hydrogen from biomass Fig. 2 shows the effect of the reforming temperature on the production of hydrogen by direct SR of lignin over the NiLaTiAl catalyst. The products derived from the SR process mainly consisted of gas products, organic liquid products (OLPs) and solid (coke/char/ash). Increasing the temperature resulted in the increase in gas yield, accompanied by the decrease in the OLPs and coke/char yields. This indicates that high temperature favors lignin pyrolysis and the SR of carbon-containing intermediates (organics, coke and char). The hydrogen yield increases monotonically with increasing temperature, reaching 14.0 gH2/(100 gbiomass) at 800 °C. The gaseous products consisted of H2, CO, CO2 and a small amount of CH4, originating from the pyrolysis of lignin together with the SR of oxygenates and the WGS reaction. The typical gas products obtained from the high-temperature reforming at 800 °C contained 63.29 vol% H2, 10.08 vol% CO, 26.59 vol% CO2 and 0.04 vol% CH4. The formation of CO increased with increasing temperature along with a decrease in CO2, attributed to that the high temperatures suppressed the exothermic WGS reaction. In turn, increasing temperature improved the methane SR, and methane was almost completely converted at 800 °C. In addition, the similar temperature dependences on the hydrogen production from cellulose, hemicellulose and sawdust were also observed (see Figs. A.1–A.3 in the Supporting Information). Considering that direct SR of biomass inevitably produce carbon monoxide, the transformation of CO to the targeted products of H2 and CO2 were needed for the preparation of high-pure hydrogen. Accordingly, the coupled WGS reaction using the CuZnAl catalyst was on-line conducted. Fig. 3 shows the production of hydrogen by coupling the sawdust SR at 800 °C and the WGS reaction in the range of 150–350 °C. The hydrogen yield increased from 13.1 gH2/(100 gbiomass) to 14.8 gH2/(100 gbiomass) as increasing WGS temperature from 150 °C to 250 °C. However, increasing WGS temperature over 250 °C shows a decrease in the hydrogen yield, since WGS is an exothermic reaction. Thus, the hydrogen yield present the maximal value near 250 °C. Notably, no carbon monoxide was detected via the coupling the SR at 800 °C with the WGS at 250 °C, and as a result, the WGS reaction further improved the hydrogen yield by converting CO to H2 and CO2."
7,Comparison of hydrogen production among different biomass and components,"3.2 Comparison of hydrogen production among different biomass and components To reveal the differences among three major components of lignocellulosic biomass, we compared the performances of hydrogen production from lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose by coupling SR and WGS. As shown in Table 2 , the production of hydrogen from lignin present the highest hydrogen yield of 16.6 gH2/(100 gbiomass) under the typical conditions (TSR = 800 °C and TWGS = 250 °C). The hydrogen yield, derived from cellulose (13.8 gH2/100 gbiomass) and hemicellulose (14.3 gH2/100 gbiomass), are obviously lower than that from lignin. Theoretically, the production of hydrogen from biomass can be evaluated by the following reactions, mainly including the pyrolysis of biomass to carbonaceous intermediates (Eq. (7)), the SR of these carbonaceous organics to H2 and CO (Eq. (8)) and the WGS reaction to H2 and CO2 (Eq. (9)) [32,33]. (7) C x H y O z ( biomass ) → C m H n O k ( oxygenates ) + HCs ( hydrocarbons ) + char / tar + gases (8) C m H n O k + HCs + char / tar + H 2 O ( steam ) → CO + H 2 (9) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + CO 2 Generally, the overall stoichiometric expression for the production of hydrogen from biomass was represented by: (10) C x H y O z + ( 2 x - z ) H 2 O → ( 2 x + y / 2 - z ) H 2 + xCO 2 The theoretical yields, estimated for lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses, are 17.5, 15.2 and 15.1 gH2/(100 gbiomass) respectively. This suggested that almost all of carbon-containing species derived from biomass pyrolysis were effectively converted to H2 and CO2 via the coupling the high-temperature SR with the low-temperature WGS reaction. This is also supported by the facts that the yields of OLPs, CH4 and CO were very low. Among three major components of biomass (lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses), both theoretical hydrogen yield and actual one obtained from high temperature reforming of lignin were obviously higher than the yields derived from cellulose and hemicelluloses under the same conditions (Table 2). Higher hydrogen yield from lignin could be mainly attributed to lower oxygen content of lignin (Table 1). The gas composition derived from lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose under the coupling SR (800 °C) with WGS (250 °C) are similar, typically consisting about 66 vol% H2 and 33 vol% CO2. The concentration of methane was very low, indicating that the intermediate of methane was almost completely converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide by the high temperature SR and the WGS reaction. However, the hydrogen yields obtained from the low temperature reforming (500 °C) with the WGS reaction are much lower than the theoretical yields, since a large amount of organic intermediates, coke and tar were not converted. The gas yields for three biomass components decreased in the order: hemicellulose > cellulose > lignin, indicating that hemicellulose and cellulose are easier to reform at the lower temperature. As shown in Table 2, the performance of the hydrogen production from three actual biomass feedstocks was also compared. At T SR = 800 °C, the hydrogen yields obtained from rice husk, sawdust and sugarcane bagasse are 14.5, 14.8 and 16.0 gH2/(100 gbiomass) respectively. Among the three biomass feedstocks tested, sugarcane bagasse with the lowest oxygen content and lignin content resulted in the highest yield of hydrogen. Compared with the high temperature SR, the overall gas yields from the low temperature SR obviously decreased, accompanied by the increase of OLPs and solid (mainly coke and tar). The above results revealed that the hydrogen yields derived from different feedstocks mainly depended on their oxygen content, the contents of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose and the reaction temperature. Moreover, the mass balance ranged from 87.9 wt% to 98.5 wt% (Table A.2 in the Supporting Information)."
8,Production of high-pure hydrogen by an integrated process,"3.3 Production of high-pure hydrogen by an integrated process Hydrogen (especially pure hydrogen) is an important raw material, which has been widely used in petrochemical and metallurgical industry. Here, we demonstrated that the production of high-pure hydrogen from biomasses was able to be achieved through the integrated process, including SR at 800 °C, WGS at 250 °C and CO2 removal at 25 °C (Fig. 1). As can be seen from Fig. 4 , the main gas compositions were H2 and CO2 together with very low content of CH4 through coupling SR with WGS. After the CO2 removal, H2 purity of >99.9 vol% was obtained. In addition, the performances of three different adsorbents, including saturated Ca(OH)2, 10% NaOH and 20% (CaO + Na2CO3) solution, have been tested for the separation of CO2 from the obtained rich-hydrogen gas. When the saturated Ca(OH)2 adsorbent was used, the concentration of CO2 was reduced from 33.19 vol% to 16.70 vol%. The 10% NaOH solution also showed higher adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide, and 71.6% CO2 in the mixture gas was removed. However, this adsorbents environmentally harmful because of containing strong alkaline composition. Among the tested adsorbents, the 20% (CaO + Na2CO3) solution presented the best CO2 removal efficiency, resulting in a gas product of 99.93 vol% H2. Accordingly, the production of high purity hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass can be obtained via the integrated process."
9,Stability of catalysts,"3.4 Stability of catalysts Fig. 5 compared the stability of the NiLaTiAl catalyst with that of the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst in the SR process. The hydrogen yield showed an obvious downward trend with increasing the reaction time. The decay rate of hydrogen yield (k) was defined by the following equation (Eq. (11)): (11) k = ( Y H 2 ( t = 0 ) - Y H 2 ( t ) ) / t which Y H2 (t = 0) and Y H2 (t) stand for the hydrogen yield at the beginning and the hydrogen yield after a given reaction time (t). The decay rate of hydrogen yield using the NiLaTiAl catalyst was about 3.9 wt%/h, which was obviously slower than 5.6 wt%/h using the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates that the NiLaTiAl catalyst behaviors a higher stability as compared with the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, the distribution of the gas products also varied with the reaction time (Fig. 5b, and c). Increasing the reaction time resulted in a gradual decrease in the concentration of H2 and CO2 in the gas products, accompanied by the increase in the CH4 and CO concentration. This further indicates that the catalyst gradually deactivated in the SR process. In order to further investigate the reasons for the deactivation of the catalysts, we analyzed the changes of the composition and the size of the catalysts in the SR process by the XRD. For the fresh NiLaTiAl catalyst (Fig. 6 a), the characteristic diffraction peaks of NiO, TiO2 and Al2O3 components were observed. However, the characteristic diffraction peaks of the metal Ni component were also observed for the NiLaTiAl catalyst after the SR reaction (Fig. 6b). The fresh NiO/Al2O3 catalyst presents the characteristic diffraction peaks of NiO and Al2O3 (Fig. 6c), and the metal Ni was also identified in the used NiO/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 6d). This means that some of NiO was reduced to the metal Ni during the biomass reforming process. Furthermore, the grain size of the Ni-containing composition is estimated by using the Scherrer equation [34]. After the SR, the size of the Ni component in the NiLaTiAl catalyst increased from 14.4 nm to 24.4 nm, and the size in the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst increased from 15.4 nm to 32.4 nm, respectively. It is known that the increase in the size of the active component will reduce the efficiency of the SR [35], which would be one of the reasons caused the catalyst deactivation. As shown in Fig. 7 , the temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis for determining the carbon content deposited on the used catalysts was performed. The coke content for the used NiLaTiAl catalyst at T SR = 800 °C for 10 h was about 1.4 mgc/(gcatalyst·h), which was obviously lower than the level of 5.7 mgc/(gcatalyst·h) obtained from the used NiO/Al2O3 catalyst. This result agrees with the stability tests that the deactivation rate over the NiLaTiAl catalyst was slower than that over the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, two distinct peaks around 320 °C and 460 °C were observed in DTA curves, corresponding to the amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon deposited on NiO/Al2O3 [36]. According to the characterizations for the fresh, used and regenerated NiLaTiAl catalysts (Table A.3 in the Supporting Information), the deactivation of the catalyst should be mainly attributed to coke deposition together with the alterations of the size of the active components (Ni and NiO), which agreed with the previous work [1,15,34]. In view of the fact that the deactivated catalyst was able to be regenerated by the combustion treatment of coke (see Fig. A.4 in the Supporting Information), the coke deposition on the catalyst should be the main factor for the catalyst deactivation during the SR process. There are several reports on the production of hydrogen by the reforming of biomass-derived feeds (like bio-oil or glucose) using the La2O3 modified Ni-based catalysts [1,15,34]. It has proved that the incorporation of La2O3 with Ni improved the catalyst stability during the reforming process. This work also showed that NiLaTiAl catalyst suppressed the formation of coke and improved the catalyst stability during the steam reforming of biomass."
10,Reaction pathways for transformation of biomass to high-pure hydrogen,"3.5 Reaction pathways for transformation of biomass to high-pure hydrogen As shown in Fig. 8 , the production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass and their three components mainly includes three reaction steps: (1) the formation of organic intermediates by the biomass pyrolysis; (2) the production of hydrogen-rich gas by the catalytic SR of organic intermediates; (3) the formation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide by the WGS reaction. Due to the different polymer structure of three components of biomass, their pyrolysis behavior and the formation of organic intermediates are quite different. Generally, lignin pyrolysis mainly forms methoxylated phenols and other phenolic compounds [37–39]. The main products from cellulose pyrolysis are anhydrosugars, furans and other condensable oxygenated products (like dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehydes) [40–43]. Hemicellulose pyrolysis mainly generates furfural, acetic acid, alcohols and ketones [44]. Based on the different model oxygenates study (see Table A.4 in the Supporting Information), the hydrogen yield in the low-temperature reforming of phenolic compounds (like phenol) is significantly lower than that of other types of compounds (like acetic acid, alcohols, ketones and furans). This further confirms the experimental facts that the efficiency of production hydrogen from lignin is obviously lower than that from cellulose or hemicellulose under low temperature reforming conditions. For high temperature SR reactions, phenols, sugars, ketones, alcohols and acids can be almost completely converted (see Table A.5 in the Supporting Information), resulting in smaller difference of hydrogen yields for three biomass components. The main factor that affects hydrogen yield under high temperature conditions is the content of C, H, O in the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock. Finally, the production of hydrogen using different thermochemical technologies such as pyrolysis, SR, coupling SR and WGS was compared (Table 3 ). The hydrogen yield depends mainly on the biomass feedstocks, the reforming catalysts, the reaction temperature and the reaction process design. Hydrogen yield reported in the literature are typically 3.8–12.8 gH2/100 gbiomass when using Ni-based catalysts. Present work shows the hydrogen yields for six biomass feedstocks (rice husk, sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) ranged from 13.8 to 16.6 gH2/100 gbiomass, which are obviously higher than the values reported in previous work. This was attributed to the fact that present route by coupling SR and WGS greatly improves the hydrogen yields for all tested biomass feedstocks."
11,Conclusions,"Production of high-pure hydrogen from different lignocellulosic biomasses and three major components were realized using an integrated transformation process. For three major components of biomass, lignin presents the highest hydrogen yield of 16.6 gH2/(100 gbiomass). On the contrary, the hydrogen yield derived from cellulose and hemicellulose are obviously lower than that from lignin. The hydrogen yields, obtained from rice husk, sawdust and sugarcane bagasse by coupling SR and WGS are 14.5, 14.8 and 16.0 gH2/(100 gbiomass) respectively. Typically, the production of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass and their three components mainly includes three reaction steps: biomass pyrolysis, SR of organic intermediates and the WGS reaction. The hydrogen yields from different biomass feedstocks were determined by the oxygen content, the contents of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses, intermediate’s types and the reaction conditions. High hydrogen yields and high hydrogen purity (>99.9 vol%) obtained were attributed to that almost all of carbon-containing species were converted to hydrogen in the integrated process. The coke deposition on the catalyst should be the main factor for the catalyst deactivation during the SR process. Potentially, present transformation offers a useful way for the efficient production of high-pure hydrogen using renewable lignocellulosic biomass sources."
