0,Introduction,"With the increasing demand for reducing CO2 emissions all over the world, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has become a promising route that can converting the greenhouse gas into high-value added liquid energy-carrier [1-4]. Methanol is an excellent alternative fuel for vehicles and important chemical feedstock for producing formaldehyde, acetic acid, olefins and aromatics etc. However, due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2 molecule, CO2 conversion is hard to be improved in methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation [5]. Another challenge is the easy formation of undesired byproducts CO from the competitive reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [6, 7]. Therefore, an efficient catalyst should be developed to improve the catalyst activity and methanol selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. In the past decades, a large number of catalysts have been developed for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Among those catalysts, Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 system (CZZ) is the most popular type due to its prominent catalytic activity and methanol selectivity which are directly determined by metallic Cu dispersion and surface basicity of CZZ catalyst [8-11]. Recent years, some unconventional routes have been reported to prepare CZZ catalyst, mainly aiming to improve the copper surface area and dispersion. Bonura et al. [12] found that the CZZ catalyst prepared from gel-oxalate coprecipitation procedure showed much higher copper surface area and dispersion than those samples obtained from coprecipitation with sodium bicarbonate and complexation with citric acid methods. Arena et al. [8, 13, 14] developed a reverse co-precipitation method under ultrasound irradiation to prepare CZZ catalysts. They found that the increase of Zn/Cu ratio improved the dispersion of metallic Cu acting as hydrogenation active site and enhanced the surface oxides basic site for adsorbing and activating CO2 molecules. Witoon et al.’s study [15] showed that increasing Zn/Cu ratio of CZZ catalyst prepared via a reverse coprecipitation method provided a better inter-dispersion of metal components (Cu, Zn and Zr), leading to a smaller CuO crystallite size, a higher porosity and Cu dispersion of the catalysts. Furthermore, the interaction between CO2 molecules and the catalyst surface was also alleviated which was beneficial to the formation of methanol at a lower reaction temperature (240 and 250 °C). Dong et al. [16] prepared a series of CZZ catalysts by precipitation-reduction method of which the exposed Cu surface area and the ratio of Cu0/Cu+ could be adjusted by changing the content of NaBH4 reducing agent. Guo et al. synthesized CZZ catalyst by urea–nitrate combustion method [17] and glycine–nitrate combustion method [18]. The metallic copper surface and dispersion of CuO and the phase state of ZrO2 could be effectively improved by adopting suitable fuel content. The above reports clearly indicated that the nature of the active site and fine structure of CZZ catalyst could be effectively tuned by using appropriate preparation method and changing catalyst composition. Besides Cu-ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst, Cu-ZnO-CeO2 [6] and Cu-ZnO-Ce1−xZrxO2 [19] catalysts have also been applied in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The Ce1−xZrxO2 solid solution contained more oxygen vacancies which provided a larger adsorption and an easy spillover of active hydrogen species to speed up the hydrogenation of formate intermediate to form methanol [19, 20]. In order to further improve the activity and stability of CZZ catalyst, some porous carriers such as silica [21], carbon nanotubes [22] and Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [23] have been used to modify or support it. The large surface area of these materials is beneficial for improving the copper dispersion of catalyst, meanwhile, the adsorption capacity of CO2 can be enhanced due to the increase of surface basicity of catalyst [21, 24]. Attapulgite (ATP) is another promising natural porous nanomaterial, with an ideal chemical formula of Mg5Si8O20(OH)2(OH2)4•4H2O, has large surface area and special porous structure [25]. Recently, we developed a series of ATP/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (ATP-CZO) nanocomposites by different methods and applied to support Cu-ZnO-Fe2O3-K2O catalyst (CZFK) for CO2 hydrogenation reaction [26]. The CZFK catalyst supported on ATP-CZO nanocomposite which is prepared by polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) modified solution combustion method (ATP-CZO-SC-P400) showed the largest BET surface area (SBET) and more strong basic sites, thus obtaining the highest yield of methanol and CO from CO2 hydrogenation. The exposed copper surface area and dispersion of metallic copper of CZFK/ATP-CZO-SC-P400 catalyst exhibited a volcano variation trend with the increase of PEG 400 addition content. As mentioned above, the catalytic hydrogenation performances of Cu-ZnO based catalysts are also been largely affected by catalyst composition. Some metallic promoters, like La, Ce, Nd, Pr, Mg, Mn, were added to improve the metallic copper surface and dispersion of CuO [27, 28], which can increase the catalytic activity of methanol synthesis. Fe, as typical Fischer–Tropsch (FT) element, was usually applied to increase the selectivity of higher alcohols (C2+OH) from CO or CO2 hydrogenation reaction due to a strong carbon chain growth ability [29-32], while its application in methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is rarely reported. In fact, Fe effectively inhibited the sintering and oxidation of Cu and elevated the catalytic stability of Cu-based catalysts at high temperatures for the RWGS reaction [33]. In our previous work [26], the iron promoter improved the interdispersion of mixed metal oxides and the interactions between Cu species and other metal oxides (ZnO, Fe2O3 and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 solid solution) in CZFK/ATP-CZO-SC-P400 catalyst. However, the effects of iron promoter on the structure and catalytic performances of Cu-ZnO-K2O catalyst (CZK) are not clear. Therefore, in the present work, a series of ATP-CZO-SC-P400 supported CZFK catalysts were synthesized with theoretical Fe/Cu molar ratio from 0 to 2.0 and Cu/Zn molar ratio of 1.0. The physicochemical properties of prepared catalysts with different Fe content were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption, N2O chemisorption, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO2-Temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) techniques. The effects of Fe promoter on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performances of the catalysts would be importantly addressed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Attapulgite powders were provided by ZHONGKE New Energy Technological Development Co., Ltd (Huai-An, China) and the acid-activated ATP was prepared by 21 wt% H2SO4 activation [34]. Ce(NO3)3•6H2O (AR) and ZrO(NO3)2•2H2O (AR) are purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Ethylene glycol and PEG 400 are purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. These reagents were used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation ATP-CZO-SC-P400 nanocomposite was prepared according to our previous work and abbreviated as ATP-CZO [26]. 10.2 g Ce(NO3)3•6H2O and 2.1 g ZrO(NO3)2•2H2O were sufficiently dissolved in 20 mL de-ionized water/ethylene glycol mixed solvent (v/v=1/1). 10 g acid-activated ATP powder (100 mesh) and 3g PEG 400 were homogenously dispersed in the above solution by ultrasonification for 20 min, and then magnetically stirred for 4.5 h. The resulting gel was combusted in air from room temperature to 500 °C at a rate of 2.5 °C/min and remained for 6 h. These ATP-CZO-SC-P400 supported CZFK catalysts were synthesized by excessive impregnation method. The nitrates precursors of Cu, Zn and Fe and anhydrous potassium carbonate were solubilized in H2O by stirring, and then was impregnated into ATP-CZO-SC-P400 powder (>100 mesh) for 4.5 h. Excessive solution was removed by vacuum filtration. The obtained catalyst precursor was dried in air at 120 °C overnight, and then calcined in air at 350 °C for 5.5 h. These catalysts were denoted as CZFxK/ATP-CZO (x= 0, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalyst composition was determined by XRF on an AxiosmAX-Petro XRF (PANalytical, Netherlands). The composition was expressed in percentage by weight of oxides. XRD analysis was conducted using a X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (PANalytical, Netherlands) in the 2θ range from 5 o to 80o with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The textural properties of catalyst were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption at liquid N2 temperature using an ASIQMO002-2 analyzer (Quantachrome, US). The adsorption isotherms branch was applied to calculate the surface area according to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution (PSD) was obtained using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. TEM observation was performed on a JEM-2100F microscope (JEOL, Japan) operating at 200 kV. Before testing, a little sample was dispersed in anhydrous ethanol by ultrasonification and dripped onto a carbon film-coated cooper grid. XPS detection of fresh catalysts was conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, US) with Al Kα radiation (1486.8 eV). The binding energy (BE) was calibrated using the C1s peak (284.6 eV) as the reference. H2-TPR experiments of these catalysts were carried out by using a ChemBET Pulsar-1 automated chemisorption analyzer (Quantachrome, US) in a U shape quartz tube reactor. Prior to reduction, the catalyst (120 mg) was pretreated in Ar gas flow at 120 °C for 60 min. After that, the reduction experiment was started from 50 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in 10%H2/Ar flow of 30 mL/min. The hydrogen consumption was monitored by a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) and quantified by five pulses calibration. The Cu surface area and dispersion of these catalysts were determined by N2O chemisorption measurement on the same reactor as H2-TPR detection [26]. Firstly, the fresh catalysts (105 mg) were reduced in 10%H2/Ar mixture at 400 °C for 2 h and the amount of hydrogen consumption was denoted as X. And then, the reactor was purged with Ar to 50 °C. The 20%N2O/N2 gas was introduced to reoxidize surface copper atoms to Cu2O for 1 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was flushed with Ar to remove the oxidant. Finally another TPR experiment was performed as the same as the first reduction and the amount of consumed H2 was denoted as Y. By quantifying the amount of consumed H2, the dispersion of Cu and exposed Cu surface area of the catalyst were calculated by the following equations, respectively. D C u = 2 Y / X × 100 ( % ) S A C u = ( 2 × Y × N a v ) / ( X × M C u × 1.4 × 10 19 ) ≈ 1353 × Y / X ( m 2 − C u / g − C u ) Where, DCu is dispersion of Cu, SACu is exposed Cu surface area, Nav is Avogadro's constant (6.02 × 1023 atoms/mol), MCu is the relative atomic mass (63.456 g/mol), and 1.4 × 1019 is the number of Cu atoms per square meter. CO2-TPD experiments of these catalysts were conducted in the same reactor as H2-TPR experiment. The catalyst was firstly reduced at 400 °C for 1 h in a continuous 10%H2/Ar flow of 30 mL/min. After cooling to 50 °C, the catalyst was saturated in CO2 flow for 1 h and then flushed with Ar to remove the physical adsorbed molecules. Then, the CO2 desorption process was performed from 50 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in Ar gas flow and the desorbed CO2 was recorded by a mass spectrometer. In-situ DRIFTS analysis was applied to detect the surface adsorbed species after CO2 adsorption. All spectra were recorded by a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker, US) equipped with a liquid N2 cooled MCT detector. The spectra were obtained by 32 scans and each scan was collected ranging from 800 to 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Each sample was first reduced at 400 °C for 1 h in 10%H2/Ar and then cooled down to 50 °C. And then the pre-reduced samples were exposed to H2/CO2 for 1 h and purged with N2 for 5 min. After collecting the background spectra, the DRIFTS tests were carried out at 320 °C in H2/CO2 (3:1) gas flow of 60 mL/min under pressure of 0.2 MPa."
5,Catalytic performances evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic performances evaluation CO2 hydrogenation performances of these catalysts were evaluated in a stainless steel tubular, continuous-flow, fixed-bed reactor (internal diameter, 8 mm; length, 280 mm) [32]. Catalyst particles (60-80 mesh, 2.7 g) diluted with quartz sand (40-60 mesh, 9 g) was firstly reduced in pure H2 under pressure of 0.5 MPa at 400 °C for 4 h. After reduction, the reactor was cooled down to 100 °C and then the reactant gas flow (H2/CO2 with molar ratio of 3/1) was introduced into the reactor, raising the pressure to 6.0 MPa and adjusting the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) to 5000 h−1. When the reactor temperature increased to 320 °C, CO2 hydrogenation reaction was timed to start. The gaseous products (H2, CO2, CO and CH4) were off-line analyzed by gas chromatographs (GC) with a TDX-01 column (1 m × 3 mm) and a TCD. The liquid products were analyzed by GC with a FFAP column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). CO2 conversion and products selectivity were calculated by mass-balance method [32]. The space time yield (STY) of CH3OH and CO was calculated according to Dong et al. [16]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structural and Textural properties,"3.1 Structural and Textural properties The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding PSD curves of the ATP-CZO composite and these CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts are displayed in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1a, the type IV isotherms with a big H3-type hysteresis loop are observed for all the samples, indicating the presence of meso/macropores [15, 35]. However, the adsorbed volume of ATP-CZO support is much higher than that of catalysts. From Fig. 1b, it can be seen that all PSD plots derived from desorption curve show a common peak centered at about 3.8 nm which is caused by an abrupt desorption of N2 at a relative pressure (P/P0) of about 0.4. The rising branch curve of the peaks located at the range of 5-100 nm and the highest N2 desorption changes remarkably with increasing the content of Fe promoter. From the textural properties as shown in Table 1 , it can be seen that the BET surface area (SBET) and pore volume (VP) of these catalysts are much smaller than ATP-CZO composite, indicating the surface of ATP-CZO composite was covered by metallic oxides. The CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst has a SBET of 67.9 m2/g and Vp of 0.249 cm3/g. The introduction of Fe promoter leaded to a slight decrease of SBET but increase of Vp and average pore diameter (DP) for the CZF0.3K/ATP-CZO catalyst. However, the further increase of Fe content brought the increase of SBET and Vp, which is consistent with the unsupported CZFK catalysts prepared by co-precipitation method [32]. Fe has been determined as a structural promoter for Cu-based catalyst to improve the dispersion of active oxide particles [29, 30]. N2O chemisorption was used to detect the dispersion of metallic Cu (DCu) and surface area of Cu (SACu). The calculated DCu and SACu according to these equations reported by Van Der Grift et al. [36] are showed in Table 1. A higher DCu and SACu are obtained in these catalysts with higher Fe content, indicating that the addition of Fe promoter improved the dispersion of metallic Cu. The XRD patterns of ATP-CZO composite and fresh and reduced CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction peaks of palygorskite, quartz and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 solid solution are observed all samples with similar 2θ value and peak intensity (Fig. 2A), implying the loading of Cu, Zn and Fe did not bring obvious change to the crystal structure of ATP-CZO composite. As can be noted from Fig. 2A, with regard to all the samples, no characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnO and Fe2O3 are present, which may be resulted from the lower loading content of CZFK particles. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 35.7o, 38.9o, 49.0o, 58.5o and 61.7o are corresponded to CuO (JCPDS, No. 45-0937), of which the intensity decreases gradually with the increase of Fe addition [32]. Similarly, the peak intensity of formed metallic Cu after reduction at 400 °C also decreases companying with the peak intensity increase of metallic Fe (Fig. 2B). The crystallite size of metallic Cu (2θ = 43.3°) on these CZFxK/ATP-CZO samples determined by Scherrer equation (Table 1) decreases from 71.5 nm (x = 0) to 17.9 nm (x = 2.0), showing that incorporation of Fe facilitates the dispersion of metallic Cu [29], which is consistent with the N2O chemisorption results. The HRTEM images of fresh CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts were also observed as shown in Fig. 3 . All samples exhibit spherical particles dispersing on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, more rod-like crystals are exposed when the Fe/Cu molar ratio is much higher, while the average particle size of CuO particles gradually decreased which is consistent with the XRD results."
8,Effect of Fe addition on the reducibility of catalysts,"3.2 Effect of Fe addition on the reducibility of catalysts The TPR profiles of CZFxK/ATP-CZO samples are shown in Fig. 4 . For all catalysts, the reduction peaks of CuO (α peak) are centered in the range of 220 ∼ 350 °C and divided into two peaks (250 ∼ 280 °C and 270 ∼ 310 °C) which are corresponded to the reduction of CuO species with small and large crystalline particle size, respectively [37]. With the addition of Fe promoter, the reduction peak of CuO gradually transfers towards lower temperature, demonstrating the reduction of CuO was promoted [29, 32]. Though the total H2 consumption proportion of CuO reduction showed a decrease from 76.6% to 45.4% (Table 2 ) due to the decrease of CuO content in these catalysts (Table 1), the α peak area of CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst is the highest among these CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts, implying the presence of more dispersed CuO species (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that a pair of shoulder peaks (β peak) in the range of 320 ∼ 400 °C are accompanied with the reduction peak of CuO species only on the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst. It can be assigned to the reduction of composited copper oxides [26, 32], indicating some extra active copper species are present in the catalyst. Because of the intrinsic Fe2O3 in ATP-CZO itself (Table 1), the consecutive reduction peak (γ peak) of Fe2O3→Fe3O4→FeO→Fe with lower intensity is also displayed at 400 ∼ 750°C on the CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst [38]. The increase of Fe addition promoted the increase of the total H2 consumption proportion of Fe2O3 reduction from 23.4% to 54.6% (Table 2), showing that more iron oxides were formed and reduced [29]. According to the N2O chemisorption detection results (Table 1), the increase of Fe addition continually promoted the dispersion of metallic Cu. However, the highest total H2 consumption was obtained on the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst. Therefore, there are some other factors for enhancing H2 chemisorption (Table 2) [26]: (1) the decrease of interaction between dispersed CuO and ATP; (2) the intimate contact between CuO and other oxides (Ce-Zr-O solid solution, ZnO and Fe2O3) for increased interactions; (3) the improved dispersion of CuO upon ZnO sheets to form much more Cu-ZnO interface."
9,Effect of Fe addition on the surface chemical state and formation of oxygen vacancies,"3.3 Effect of Fe addition on the surface chemical state and formation of oxygen vacancies XPS measurements of CZK/ATP-CZO, CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO and CZF2.0K/ATP-CZO catalysts were carried out to investigate the surface chemical state and the assignment of oxygen species. As shown in Fig. 5 , a peak at lower BE of 932.7 ∼ 933.2 eV and another peak at higher BE of 934.6 ∼ 935.3 eV are observe on the XPS spectra of Cu 2p3/2, which is assigned to the CuA 2+ in tetrahedral CuO (A) species [39] and the CuB 2+ in octahedral composite metal oxides (B) [30], respectively. Furthermore, a pair of satellite peaks at higher BE of 940 ∼ 945 eV ascribed to the shake-up transitions by ligand-to-metal 3d charge transform are also present [40]. From the peak area proportion of CuB 2+/(CuA 2++CuB 2+) in Table 3 , it can be seen that the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst owns the highest proportion of octahedral CuB 2+ which has also been determined by H2-TPR (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The XPS spectra of Fe 2p3/2 shows similar XPS peak information with Cu 2p3/2, on which a peak at lower BE of 711.0 ∼ 711.9 eV ascribed to FeA 3+ in Fe2O3 phase and another peak at higher BE of 713.8 ∼ 714.9 eV assigned to FeB 3+ in composite metal oxide phase are obviously observed [30]. The FeB 3+ in CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst shows the highest BE, while the peak area proportion of FeB 3+/(FeA 3++FeB 3+) is the lowest, implying the presence of the strongest interaction between Cu and Fe species. Much more Cu-Fe dual-functional active site can be formed due to the enhancement of Cu-Fe interaction, thus improving the equilibrium capacity between C−O bond insertion and C−C chain growth to produce more alcohols from CO hydrogenation [38, 41-47]. Therefore, when performing CO2 hydrogenation to produce alcohols, the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst showed the optimal activity level, as would be expected. For the XPS spectra of Zn 2p, the characteristic peak at BE of 1045 eV and 1021 eV is ascribed to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, indicating the surface phase of Zn species is ZnO [48]. The increase of iron addition leads to the decline of XPS peak intensity, implying that ZnO was covered by other metallic species with a higher extent at higher iron addition. The formation and accumulation of adsorbed oxygen species has been proved to be favorable for enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions [37, 49-51]. The chemical state of oxygen species over the ATP-CZO supported Cu-ZnO based catalysts surface by fitting the XPS curves is shown in Fig. 5 and the relative proportion of surface adsorbed oxygen species (Oβ) at 531.7 eV and surface lattice oxygen species (Oα) at 529.6 eV is calculated on basis of the XPS data as shown in Table 3. It has been reported that the adsorbed oxygen species are related to the groups including −OH in water and C−O in CO3 2− which is derived from carbonate species trapped by oxygen vacancies [49, 52]. Therefore, the amount of oxygen vacancies can be obtained from the relative proportion of adsorbed oxygen species (Oβ) [52]. From Table 3, it is noted that the Oα/Oβ ratio shows a gradual increase with the increase of iron addition, indicating much more surface lattice oxygen species are formed due to the stronger interaction between the oxygen atoms and other metallic atoms. In addition, a fitting peak at 532.2 eV is attributed to the surface oxidized metal ions (Oγ) in the catalyst nanoparticles [53]. The CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst shows the highest Oα+Oβ proportion in the entire surface oxygen species, which means that the adsorption and activation of CO2 can be improved to enhance the CO2 hydrogenation activity."
10,Effect of Fe addition on the adsorption behavior of catalysts,"3.4 Effect of Fe addition on the adsorption behavior of catalysts CO2-TPD was performed from 50 °C to 800 °C to detect the basicity site of H2-reduced CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 , two broad CO2 desorption bands are displayed ranging from 60 °C and 300 °C to 250 °C and 700 °C (labeled as LT and HT peaks, respectively), which is similar with our previous report [26]. For the ATP-CZO support, the LT peak (α peak) centered at 127.1 °C is assigned to weakly basic hydroxyl groups on the ATP and Ce-Zr-O oxide [16, 54]. The HT peak is fitted to form a main peak (β peak) at 429.7 °C accompanying with a overlapped peak at 610.4 °C (γ peak), which is attributed to the existence of low coordination oxygen atoms [55] and the bidentate carbonate species derived from the strong basic sites of Ce-Zr mixed oxides [54], respectively. For these H2-reduced CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts, the peak intensity of α peak shows different extent of decrease due to the loss of weakly basic hydroxyl groups during the calcination process of the catalyst. However, the peak temperature is much higher compared to ATP-CZO support which may be related with the enhanced interaction between metallic species and ATP-CZO support. On the contrary, the introduction of CZFK metallic particles lead to the decrease of desorption peak temperature of β and γ peaks on the ATP-CZO support. The β peak intensity also shows a decrease due to the H2 reduction of catalyst but the γ peak intensity obviously increases, especially for the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst which shows the highest CO2 desorption proportion of 65.9% (Table 4 ). Our previous work has determined that the γ peak was caused by the formation of ZnO-CZO interfaces active sites for CO2 adsorption and conversion due to the enhancement of interaction between ZnO and Ce-Zr-O oxide [26]. Therefore, the decrease of γ peak intensity (CO2 desorption proportion) with the increase of Fe addition when the actual Fe/(Cu+Zn) molar ratio is more than 0.46 (Table 1), implies that the formation of ZnO-CZO interfaces might be restrained because of the coverage of ZnO by excessive iron species which has been proved by XPS results. The mode of CO2 adsorption and intermediate species of CO2 hydrogenation are studied using in-situ DRIFTS. Fig. 7 a-e represent the in-situ DRIFT spectra over these H2-reduced CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts in the reaction gas (H2+CO2) at the actual CO2 hydrogenation temperature (320 °C). As shown, three key surface absorbed species, including carbonate species (1535, and 1495 cm−1) [56], formate species (2906, 1633, 1419, and 1351 cm−1) [11, 31, 57], and adsorbed CO2 (1246 cm−1) [58], were mainly detected on both other catalysts except for CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst. Moreover, the peaks at 2145 and 2107 cm−1 for adsorbed CO* appear on these Fe-modified Cu-ZnO based catalysts, suggesting the formation of CO at high temperature (320 °C), which is similar with the study of Xu et al. [31]. The bands at 1633 and 1351 cm−1 were assigned to asymmetric and symmetric O−C−O stretching vibrations respectively, and the peaks at 2906 and 1419 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration ν(CH) and bending vibration δ(CH), which are commonly belonging to the adsorbed HCOO* species [59]. For the CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst, the intensity of adsorbed CO2 (CO2*) band at 1246 cm−1 and formate bands at 2906, 1633, and 1419 cm−1 showed gradual increase with the increase of exposure time in reaction gas from 1 to 30 min, while their intensity almost kept unchanged from 30 to 60 min (Fig. 7a). Therefore, CO may be accumulated as the main CO2 hydrogenation product over CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst. After adding Fe promoter, even if the exposure time in reaction gas is only 1 min, the intensity of formate bands at 1633 and 1419 cm−1 on the CZF0.3K/ATP-CZO catalyst is enough high and shows slight decrease with the increase of exposure time to 60 min (Fig. 7b), implying that the formate species (HCOO*) might be converted into methoxy species (CH3O*) at 2831 cm−1 [60-62]. Meanwhile, the band intensity of adsorbed CO2 showed similar changing trend. When x increased 0.5, the peak intensity of all bands on the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst increased at first and then decreased (Fig. 7c), indicating the carbonate species, formate species and gaseous CO had been effectively transformed which is beneficial for the improvement of CO2 conversion. However, compared to the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst, the peak intensity of all bands changed sharply lower for the CZF1.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst as seen from the smaller proportional scale (Fig. 7d) and showed gradual increase with the increase of exposure time in reaction gas. The CZF2.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst also showed similar changing trend. Moreover, two novel peaks at 2886 cm−1 and 2973 cm−1 ascribed to the ethoxy species (CH3CH2O*) were present after 30 min (Fig. 7e), suggesting the formation of CH3CH2O* due to the enhancement of carbon chain growth ability [31]. Given above analysis, we believe that methanol was synthesized from CO2 hydrogenation over ATP-CZO supported Cu-ZnO based catalysts via formate intermediate species, and the introduction of Fe promoter facilitates the conversion of CO and formate intermediates."
11,Catalyst performances,"3.6 Catalyst performances 3.6.1 Evaluation of CO2 hydrogenation over different catalysts The CO2 hydrogenation performances over these CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts were evaluated. As shown in Table 5 , the content of Fe addition plays an important influence on the catalytic performance. As well known, CO2 is thermodynamically stable and difficult to be activated. The presence of oxygen vacancies is liable to enhance the adsorption of CO2 [11, 37, 50, 60-62]. The dispersed CuO species are responsible for catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation reaction [15, 18, 37]. Because of less ZnO-CZO interfaces (Fig. 6a) and lower dispersion of metallic Cu (Table 1) over the CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst, the CO2 conversion is only 5.9% over the CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst. The introduction of Fe promoter obviously improved the CO2 conversion to the highest value of 17.5% over the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst. From Table 1, it can be seen that the surface area SACu and dispersion of metallic Cu (DCu) were continually improved from 40 m2/g and 5.9% to 242 m2/g and 35.8% with the increase of Fe addition, respectively. However, the further increase of Fe content leaded to the decrease of CO2 conversion to 12.8% over the CZF2.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst (Table 5), which is related with its lower reduction degree during H2-TPR detection process due to the restriction of hydrogen spillover (Fig. 4e) and the restriction of CO2 adsorption over ZnO-CZO interfaces (Fig. 6f). The products selectivity was also affected by the content of Fe addition (Table 5). CO was mainly produced from CO2 hydrogenation over all catalysts through the endothermic RWGS reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) [63, 64]. CH4 was also generated with different levels by the methanation reaction of CO2 (CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O) [65]. Mixed alcohols (marked as ROH, including methanol-C1OH and higher alcohols-C2+OH) could be formed by the direct CO2 hydrogenation and hydrogenation of CO intermediate [66]. Therefore, to a certain degree, the product selectivity reflects the CO2 hydrogenation reaction routes. As shown in Table 5, with the increase of x, the selectivity of CH4 and CO decrease at first and then increase through the minima of 4.2% and 5.1%, respectively. ROH shows an opposite change trend due to the competitive reaction route of CO2 hydrogenation and achieves the maxima of 35.1% over the CZF1.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst. When x is 2.0, the formation of ROH were significantly restrained which seems to promote the production of CH4, while C2+OH with fraction of 5.4% in alcohols product suggested the formation of CH3CH2O*. The effects of the addition content of Fe promoter on the STY of methanol and CO formation over CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 a. As can be seen, the addition of Fe promoter enhanced the production of methanol and CO when x is less than 0.5 because of the improvement of metallic Cu dispersion (Table 1). However, the further increase of x to 2.0 leaded to the obvious decrease of STY of methanol which might be resulted from the improved formation of CO and CH4. To sum up, the CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO sample presents superior catalytic performance in terms of CO2 conversion and CH3OH production. The turnover frequency (TOF) which represents the number of CO and methanol produced on a unit site of a copper atom per second (s−1) on the catalyst surface, was calculated from the SCu for various catalysts to compare the catalytic efficiency. As shown in Fig. 8b, the TOFMethanol showed gradual increase with the increase of Fe addition content until reaching the maximum value of 2.4 × 10−3 over CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst, and then declined to 0.5 × 10−3 over CZF2.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst. However, the highest TOFCO of 5.0 × 10−3 was obtained over CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst, which further indicating the RWGS reaction happened dominantly. The increase of Fe promoter leaded to the decrease of TOFCO to 2.6 × 10−3 over CZF1.0K/ATP-CZO and CZF2.0K/ATP-CZO catalysts. But overall, CO is more likely to be produced than methanol by CO2 hydrogenation over CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts due to the promotion of C=O bond scission by reducible CeO2 [26]. 3.6.2 Structure-properties-catalytic performance correlations Some previous work reported that RWGS reaction over Cu-ZnO based catalysts conforms the surface redox mechanism involving the oxidation and reduction of the Cu surface, Cu(0) ⇌ Cu(I) [64, 67]. CO2 was adsorbed and dissociated to give CO and the surface oxygen species. Surface Cu(I) oxide was formed by the reaction with CO2. The oxygen species were hydrogenated to H2O and the surface Cu(I) oxide was reduced to metallic Cu. According to the XRD spectra of reduced and used CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst (Fig. 2b and 2c), the diffraction peak intensity of metallic Cu sharply declined and the diffraction peak of Cu(I) oxide was obviously displayed, implying that the Cu(I) oxide was formed by the oxidation of metallic Cu. H2-TPR result showed that much higher H2 consumption proportion (Table 2) was assigned to the reduction of dispersed CuO (α peak) over CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst (Fig. 4a). XPS result showed that much more surface adsorbed oxygen species (Oβ) (Table 3) was present than other catalysts (Fig. 5). CO2-TPD result proved that weakly basic hydroxyl groups (α peak) and low coordination oxygen atoms (β peak) occupied the main CO2 adsorption sites over CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst (Fig. 6), thus forming much more gaseous CO intermediate species on the in-situ DRIFT spectra (Fig. 7a). To sum up, as shown in Fig. 9 a, a Cu0/Cuox redox mechanism for RWGS reaction may occur at the boundary layers of metal copper in intimate contact with the surface of ZnO over CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst [26, 67]. Methanol has been extensively synthesized from CO2 hydrogenation over different metallic oxides (Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, etc.) or their composites supported and modified Cu-ZnO based catalysts [8, 10, 11, 14-16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 28, 68-70]. Some crucial factors for active sites, such as a Cu step with a nearby Zn serving as adsorption site for oxygen-bound intermediates [71], a synergy of Cu and ZnO at the interface [72, 73], and an adequate balance between metal (Cu0) and oxide surface sites (ZnO and ZrO2) [12], were proposed to form and stabilize the intermediates for methanol synthesis. Metallic copper species of which the exposed surface area [18], dispersion, particle size [74] and the ratio of Cu0/Cu+ [16], is the active site for H2 adsorption and activation to control the CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity. Oxides carriers of which the crystalline form [70] and basic sites [21, 68, 69], is the active site for the adsorption and activation of CO2 to affect the reaction routes over Cu-ZnO based catalyst system by adjusting catalyst texture and exposed metal surface [19]. Therefore, a metal-oxide dual site nature on metal/oxides interface is crucial for the efficient synthesis of methanol from CO2 hydrogenation [26]. In our previous work, it has been suggested that the ATP-CZO-SC-P400 support owns significant interactions between ATP and CZO oxides due to better dispersion of CZO particles and directionally arranged ATP rodlike crystals [26]. The introduction of moderate content of Fe promoter into CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst would bring positive effects for metallic copper species and ATP-CZO support. On one hand, according to the XRD (Fig. 2b and 2c) and XPS (Fig. 5) patterns, the generated CuFe2O4 species could act as a textural promoter to inhibit the oxidation of metallic Cu [33]. Meanwhile, the dispersion of metallic Cu (Table 1) was also improved to maintain lower particle size which provides more opportunities for the dissociative adsorption of H2 to produce atomic hydrogen and spillover onto the intimate contacted ZnO or CZO composite (Fig.9b) [16, 70, 72]. In addition, the interactions between Cu species and other metal oxides (ZnO, Fe2O3 and CZO composite) were also largely enhanced as shown in XPS (Fig. 5) and CO2-TPD results (Fig. 6). On the other hand, more surface adsorbed and lattcie oxygen species (Fig. 5 and Table 3) and ZnO-CZO interfaces active sites (Fig. 6 and Table 4) could be generated to enhance CO2 adsorption, activation and conversion into carbonate species (CO3*, HCO3*) and formate species (HCOO*) (Fig. 8). According to the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, the larger exposed copper surface area is favorable to provide large interfacial contact between copper and metal oxides [21], thus enhancing the formation and transformation of formate species into methoxy species (CH3O*). As a result, the synergistic interactions between dispersed metallic Cu particles on ZnO-Fe nano-cluster and ATP-CZO composite favored the production of methanol over CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts with x less than 0.5 [21]. With the further increase of Fe content to x = 2.0, the dispersion of metallic Cu could be increasingly improved (Table 1). However, excessive Fe content leaded to the increase of particle size of metallic Cu due to the surrounding of metallic Cu by some small metallic Fe particles. Since the formation ability of weakly basic hydroxyl groups and low coordination oxygen atoms was recovered (Table 4), more oxygen atoms produced from the reaction process on metallic Cu migrated to iron surfaces through a spillover process [33], thus effectively prevents sintering and oxidation of Cu. According to the in-situ DRIFT spectra (Fig. 7d), the peak intensity of formate species showed gradual increase with the increase of exposure time in reaction gas over CZF1.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst, implying that the formate pathway by CO2 associative methanation (CO2* → HCOO* → HCO* → CH* → CH4*) was the most plausible reaction scheme for CH4 formation [50, 65, 75, 76]. As shown in Fig. 9c, beside CO2 methanation, the RWGS reaction can occur simultaneously over CZF2.0K/ATP-CZO catalyst. The peak intensity of formate species started to decline after adsorption for 40 min in reaction gas (Fig. 7e) provided an evidence for CH4 production through formate pathway."
12,Conclusions,"The work explores the effects of Fe promoter on structure and catalytic performances of ATP-CZO nanocomposite supported Cu-ZnO based catalysts. The strong interaction effect over CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO catalyst with medium Fe addition contributes to the remarkable catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH, which leads to higher surface dispersion of metallic Cu and larger number of surface adsorbed and lattcie oxygen species and ZnO-CZO interfaces active sites, promoting H2 and CO2 adsorption and conversion ability, thus achieving high catalytic performance (STYCH3OH = 0.108 g/gcat.∙h, STYCO = 0.146 g/gcat.∙h), compared with other catalysts. Additionally, in-situ DRIFTS suggest that CZK/ATP-CZO catalyst without Fe addition is much easier to enrich HCOO∗ and CO* species while medium Fe-modified CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts (x ≤ 0.5) are more benefit to promote the hydrogenation of HCOO∗ species to generate the HCO3∗ intermediate species for methanol formation, besides excessive Fe-modified CZFxK/ATP-CZO catalysts (1.0 ≤ x ≤ 2.0) are more liable to produce CH4 via formate pathway (CO2* → HCOO* → HCO* → CH* → CH4*). The decrease of larger number of active intermediate species HCOO∗ is responsible for the higher activity of CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH over CZF0.5K/ATP-CZO sample."
