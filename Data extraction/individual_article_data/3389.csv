0,Introduction,"The main objectives of using a controlled ecological life support system (CELSS) for a Martian surface habitat are to reduce launch mass and decrease dependency on re-supply from Earth in terms of water, oxygen, and food, the latter two being integral to closure of the carbon cycle. Essentially, the carbon processing system has two components: a plant growth and preparation component and a waste-processing component. Carbon wastes can come in several forms, typically as inedible biomass, exhaled CO 2 and CO 2 reserves, human wastes, and uneaten food and related preparation wastes. When studying mass flows in a CELSS, a large fraction of waste predicted in models that involve plant growth tends to be inedible biomass from plants for all mission scenarios. Thus, there is an emphasis on biomass degradation and recovery of useful materials [1]. Plants oxidize water and reduce CO 2 into carbohydrates ( CH 2 O ) during oxygenic photosynthesis according to the following equation [2]: (1) CO 2 + H 2 O ⟶ hv ( CH 2 O ) + O 2 . Therefore, waste carbon material contains a significant fraction of hydrogen taken in from spacecraft water reserves. Over time, waste biomass can also become a drain on hydrogen (and therefore water) resources. For example, in a wheat consumption model from the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Baseline Values and Assumptions Document (BVAD) maintained by Johnson Space Center (JSC) [3], for an extended mission to Mars where all food crops are grown, the predicted total inedible biomass per crewmember-day (CM-d) is 1.271kg/CM-d. Ash analysis of wheat tops grown at the JSC in an enclosed environment indicates that hydrogen accounts for about 5% of the total weight [4]. Therefore, roughly 0.0633kg/CM-d of hydrogen or the equivalent of 0.572kg/CM-d worth of water is lost in dry inedible wheat biomass. For the Mars Design Reference Mission (DRM), a model of expected mission requirements for a short-term Mars mission, the expected surface stay for six crewmembers is 619 days [5]. Taking this as a baseline for an extended surface stay mission, a calculated loss of about 236kg of hydrogen being sequestered in unprocessed inedible biomass occurs if continuous wheat growth is conducted. This is the equivalent loss of 2124kg of water from water supplies for wheat growth alone. Since water will make up the largest supply resource by mass for a Mars mission [6], recovering this hydrogen from waste biomass will greatly reduce the overall launch mass. Various methods exist for enabling hydrogen recovery. In indirect biophotolysis, purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria have been shown to use waste carbon, typically in the form of organic acids, to produce hydrogen in a two-stage process [7]. In the first stage, acidogenic bacteria naturally present in the environment derive energy and produce some hydrogen by degrading waste carbohydrate matter into simple organic acids and alcohols. In the second stage, these organic acids are harvested and fed as a substrate to photoheterotrophic bacteria for additional hydrogen production. Photoheterotrophic bacteria of the genus Rhodobacter have been thoroughly studied under a variety of growth conditions. An anoxic inert gas environment best suits these bacteria. It has been shown that the best conversion efficiencies exist in low light (6.5–20klux) and low nitrogen (2–10mM) environments with a pH of 6.7–7.5. Ammonium and glutamate were found to be the best nitrogen nutrients, and acetate was shown to have the highest substrate conversion efficiency [8]. While these conditions require creation of an artificial environment on Earth, they are actually advantageous for Mars-based applications. Since carbon dioxide or argon (and not oxygen) are principal chemicals of the Martian atmosphere they can be potentially captured to constitute the plant growth chamber air without having to worry about oxygen contamination [9]. On Earth, careful measures must be taken to ensure that no oxygen enters the system. Also, the ambient insolation on Mars is often less than a half to a tenth of that on Earth, especially during a dust storm [10]. As it so happens, this is near the intensities reported in the literature for maximal light conversion efficiency. Indeed, both terrestrial- and space-based microgravity studies have shown that bacteria can potentially thrive in a reduced gravity environment and even produce useful bio-based products such as medicines or bioplastics [11,12]. A schematic of how indirect biophotolysis would fit in such an ALS configuration is outlined in Fig. 1 . A co-generation scheme is depicted where hydrogen produced by indirect biophotolysis is sent to a fuel cell. Machinery used in composting is powered by electricity generated from the fuel cell. Water and CO 2 are the main byproducts of the fuel cell, which are sent to respective water and air revitalization subsystems for treatment. Spent cell mass can be used as compost, depending on composting conditions. While substrate conversion efficiencies have been widely reported in the literature [8], recent work has centered on understanding the effects of using effluent of anaerobic digestion from Clostridia or mixed consortia as a feed source for photofermentation. Often, butyrate is found at a 2:1 or higher ratio with acetate in the effluent from dark fermentation in batch mode with mixed consortia [13]. It has been reported that R. sphaeroides can metabolize these substrates; however, tolerance ranges and inhibition effects by any of these substrates are not well documented. Previous researchers have noted that butyrate is converted to hydrogen with less efficiency than other substrates; while much published research exists detailing instances of butyrate utilization, sensitivity of R. sphaeroides SCJ (itself a new strain to hydrogen research) to a range of butyrate concentrations has not been studied (see Table 1 ). Therefore, this work focused on characterizing the metabolism of butyrate over a wide range of concentrations. Several specific issues were investigated: 1. The effect on hydrogen production by butyrate was systematically characterized and correlated with previous literature. 2. Substrate inhibition may exist at the butyrate concentrations expected in the inlet streams from a two-stage system. This would become evident with an increasing lag phase as butyrate concentration increases and was monitored during this study. 3. An optimal butyrate concentration for energy conversion efficiency could exist. This was assessed by comparing the total hydrogen produced while varying substrate levels."
1,Methods,
2,"Microorganism, media, and growth conditions","2.1 Microorganism, media, and growth conditions R. sphaeroides SCJ used in this study was originally isolated by Weaver et al. [14] from Jamaican soil. The culture was maintained in RCVBN Medium, according to Weaver et al. [14], with the exception that sodium acetate (50mM) and NH 4 Cl (10mM) served as the carbon and nitrogen nutrients, respectively, along with NaHCO 3 (1%, w/v). Cells were cultivated in 15mL of anaerobic sterile test tubes under light for 2 days at 30 ∘ C ."
3,Hydrogen production media,"2.2 Hydrogen production media Experiments were conducted using either sodium acetate or sodium butyrate as the carbon substrate, 8mM sodium glutamate as the nitrogen source along with 0.5% (m/v) NaHCO 3 . Also, 28.8mM KH 2 PO 4 and 34mM K 2 HPO 4 buffer was used to stabilize pH at 6.8."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup Three hundred mL samples were incubated in 2L capacity water-jacketed reactors held at 32 ∘ C . Illumination for each reactor was provided with 65W incandescent light bulbs (held at 34cm) separated by black partitions. Reactors contained two ports, a septum port and a gas displacement line. The gas displacement line was evacuated through submerged and inverted graduated cylinders. Glassware was cleaned with deionized water and ethanol, and then autoclaved. Media and bacterial inoculum was added to the reactor first, followed by purging with argon before sealing. Data were collected in triplicate for sodium butyrate with concentrations ranging from 10 to 100mM. Additionally, one trial of 25mM sodium acetate was run for comparison. All activities were conducted in Colorado, USA at an altitude of 1630m and a nominal pressure of 84.1kPa."
5,Hydrogen analysis,"2.4 Hydrogen analysis Hydrogen was determined by injecting 1.0mL of headspace gas from both the reactor and graduated cylinder to a HP 5710A Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Carboxen 1000 column (60/80 Mesh 15 ′ × 1 / 8 ″ SS) at 80 ∘ C for 4min, incremented at 32 ∘ C / min to 200 ∘ C for 4min. Barometric pressure was read from a 429 Nova Princo Mercury Barometer with each data point. Hydrogen was quantified by calculating moles based on the pressure and volume using the ideal gas law. This was then converted to STP volume for comparison with the literature."
6,Cell dry weight,"2.5 Cell dry weight Twenty mL of grown cells were withdrawn, diluted, and washed once with deionized water. After drying at 100 ∘ C , the cell dry mass was measured. A Genesys 10 Series Spectrophotometer was used to measure optical density at 660nm. Optical density was linearly correlated with dried cell mass and used to measure cell mass density."
7,Organic acids,2.6 Organic acids Two mL bacterial samples were withdrawn from the reactor through the septa port using a stainless steel cannula. The cells were spun and the supernatant filtered and run on a HP 1050 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H Ion exchange column ( 300 mm × 7.8 mm ) at 45 ∘ C . The mobile phase is 4mM H 2 SO 4 with a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. A sample of 20 μ L was injected and detected via a UV detector at 210nm.
8,Light efficiency,"2.7 Light efficiency Light efficiency was calculated based on the following equation [8]: (2) % light conversion efficiency = 100 × H 2 enth / E light , where H 2 enth is the energy of hydrogen produced, and E light is the total emitted energy of the light source. Incandescent light bulbs were characterized at 34cm from the light source with a LicorLi-1800 spectroradiometer that reported the light spectrum profile in μ mol / m 2 / s / nm per nm interval that were integrated over 300–900nm. The light spectrum profile was taken for each bulb before and after all the experiments and before and after integral values averaged (see Fig. 2 ). This was performed since incandescent light sources degrade a noticeable amount over the experiment duration. Hence, using only the original values can lead to under-reporting light efficiency. To determine the overall light energy emitted, this value was then multiplied by the tangent exposure area and used as E light . The maximum hydrogen produced in each run was taken and multiplied by the average value of 203kJ/mol to determine H 2 enth ."
9,Hydrogen efficiency and maximal hydrogen,2.8 Hydrogen efficiency and maximal hydrogen Substrate efficiency was calculated using [8]: (3) % substrate conversion efficiency = 100 × observed H 2 / theoretical H 2 . Theoretical H 2 yield from butyrate is according to the equation: (4) NaC 4 H 7 O 2 + 6 H 2 O + H + → 10 H 2 + 4 CO 2 + Na + . And for acetate: (5) NaC 2 H 3 O 2 + 2 H 2 O + H + → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + Na + . Maximum hydrogen produced and maximum hydrogen production rate were defined as the maximal total hydrogen produced and the maximal rate observed for every run.
10,Lag phase determination,"2.9 Lag phase determination Lag phase was calculated by fitting a logistic growth model to cell dry weight data [15]: (6) y ( t ) = A 1 + exp [ ( 4 μ m / A ) ( λ - t ) + 2 ] , where y ( t ) is the cell dry weight, A is the maximum population limit, μ m is the maximal growth rate, and λ is the lag phase. However, lag phase was calculated indirectly from curve fitting cell dry weight data. An exponential growth tangent was drawn and lag phase found by intersecting that line with a line representing the initial concentration."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Cell growth and lag phase at various substrate concentrations,"3.1 Cell growth and lag phase at various substrate concentrations Fig. 3 shows data for cell dry weight accumulation during cell growth at various butyrate concentrations. Data points were collected in triplicate and the values averaged. For cell dry weight, as butyrate concentration increases, the maximum growth increased until reaching 1.3mg/mL density at butyrate concentrations of 50mM or more. Acetate at 25mM was completely utilized and cell mass did not reach similar levels as butyrate, indicating that at that concentration, it is still the limiting substrate. Data from Fig. 3 also indicated that although increasing butyrate concentration resulted in higher final cell mass, the lag phase was also increased. A Student's 1-tail unpaired t -test was performed on butyrate curves from 10 to 100mM. Additionally, a Student's t -test was used to compare 25mM acetate with 25mM butyrate and was significant (data not shown). The data indicate the possibility for substrate inhibition even though the variance in the data was quite high."
13,Rate of hydrogen production and conversion efficiency at various substrate concentrations,"3.2 Rate of hydrogen production and conversion efficiency at various substrate concentrations Rates of hydrogen production were determined by measuring hydrogen accumulation in the culture headspace during growth in various substrate concentrations. Data shown in Table 2 indicated that 25mM butyrate yielded both the highest total amount of hydrogen and the highest specific rate of production. Hydrogen was not detected when the butyrate concentration is 100mM even though growth did occur (Fig. 3). Using Eq. (4) we calculated substrate conversion efficiency based on the amount of butyrate consumed, not the amount added initially, by the microbe during hydrogen production. Calculated data shown in Table 3 again indicate that the highest substrate conversion efficiency occurred at 25mM butyrate. It is likely that the carbon conversion efficiency (Table 2) is an underestimation, since an undetermined amount of the butyrate is being assimilated into new cell mass during growth instead of toward hydrogen production. Using 25mM acetate as a control, a substrate conversion efficiency of 20.8% was determined, calculated based on the amount of acetate consumed according to Eq. (5). Light conversion efficiency was calculated using 25mM butyrate and 25mM acetate according to Eq. (2), the former yielded 0.89% while the latter near 0.7%, respectively."
14,Comparison of conversion efficiencies with the literature,"3.3 Comparison of conversion efficiencies with the literature Carbon conversion efficiencies reported in the literature range from 0% to 75% [8] for butyrate and 45% to 57% [16] for acetate(Table 1). Carbon conversion efficiencies determined in our study are lower than the literature values. Both light efficiencies observed and reported show that light efficiencies can range from 0.1% to 11.3% in literature [17]. The huge variations could be due to the different microbial strains used, or experimental conditions not recorded in literature. Typical maximal hydrogen reported from literature is 30 – 60 μ L / mg / h [18]. We reported 0 – 7.7 μ mol / mg / h ( 0 – 173 μ L / mg / h ) in this study, which is comparable with those documented in the literature. A more standardized methodology should be adopted in the scientific community to compare values more accurately."
15,Summary and conclusions,"Indirect biophotolysis has the potential to allow hydrogen energy co-generation on Mars while at the same time degrading and recycling waste biomass to carbon dioxide. While many of the growth parameters of purple non-sulfur bacteria have been well studied, much work is currently being done to fully characterize the two-stage system described previously. In this study, hydrogen production response to butyrate was characterized. Based on these data, we show that optimal hydrogen production was found at 25mM butyrate, falling off and ceasing by 100mM. Yet, cell growth still occurred at higher concentrations of butyrate. Hydrogen produced from butyrate was greater than hydrogen produced by acetate in our study, with the latter likely being limited at the 25mM level. Both the carbon conversion and light conversion efficiencies are lower than those reported in the literature, although similar production rates were observed. Furthermore, a correlation between lag phase and butyrate is suggested, possibly indicating substrate inhibition. The toxicity of butyrate could be overcome in a scale-up process either by adapting cells gradually to higher concentrations of butyrate or by continuously feeding a low dose of butyrate. The results suggest that hydrogen could be sufficiently captured for use in fuel cells from what would otherwise be wasted in a CELSS for a Martian surface stay."
