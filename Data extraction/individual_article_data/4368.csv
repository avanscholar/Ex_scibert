0,Introduction,"In recent time, phosphoryl-containing alcohols attract a considerable attention from theoretical and practical viewpoints [1]. In particular, triols of type [HO(CH2)n]3PO (n = 1, 2, 3) are used in the synthesis of organophosphorus chelators [2], antiviral agents [3], therapeutics for the treatment of cancers, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases [4]. They are also employed for production of lithium cyclic triol borate salt electrolytes [5], as reagents for nucleoside modification [6] and designing metalloproteins [7], as tanning agents [8] and the components of ink-jet recording media [9,10]. The triols of this type can form metal complexes and extract alkali metal cations from glassware [11]. The complexing properties of the phosphoryl-containing triols and their derivatives provides a possibility to use them as tripodal ligands for CdSe/ZnS semiconductor nanoparticles [12], tripodal adsorbates on plasma grown aluminum and magnesium oxides [13], and for the synthesis of water-soluble metal complexes promising as catalysts [14,15]. The presence of phosphorus atom in molecule enables the use of the phosphoryl-containing triols as environmentally benign halogen-free flame retardants [16–20]. The triols exhibit good compatibility with different polymers (polyphenylene oxide compositions [21], polyurethanes [22,23], epoxy resins [24]), high thermal stability, excellent fire retardant properties [25], no corrosion, high ultraviolet stability, nontoxicity, minimal adverse change in the overall properties of polymer [21,23,24,26]. They show low volatility and do not escape polymer while in use due to extended network of hydrogen bonds. For example, tris(hydroxypropyl) phosphine oxide (1) in crystal produces highly ordered structure where each phosphoryl group forms three hydrogen bonds with adjacent hydroxyl groups from three different molecules [27]. Due to reactive functional groups, the phosphoryl-containing triols are suitable for the synthesis of fire retardants [25,28] and fire-resistant polymers [16,29–32] as co-monomers, cross-linking and curing agents [31,33]. Very recently, we prepared a series of phosphoryl-containing triols 2–4 (Scheme 1 ), which attract attention as hydroxyl-containing receptors and tripodal ligands that can form atrane-type intracomplex salts with multiply charged cations and as promising building blocks for the formation of supramolecular structures stabilized by the network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds [34–36]. The molecular structure of the phosphoryl-containing triols 2–4 is of large interest due to their use as precursors in the synthesis of preorganized tripodal ligands selective to particular cations and as anion receptors. It is obvious that compounds containing phosphoryl and hydroxyl groups in molecule can produce various hydrogen bonds in solid state and solution. Hydrogen bonding can strongly affect physical properties of material; it is useful to understand the structure of hydrogen bond system in the phosphoryl-containing triols to predict their properties such as solubility in different solvents and compatibility with polymers and membranes of ion-selective electrodes [20]. Furthermore, hydrogen-bonded networks can provide enormous stabilizations and considerable change in the pKa values of OH groups thus affecting catalytic processes [37,38]. In the series of phosphorylalkanols, hydrogen bond system can be dependent on the length of linker between functional groups. For example, effect of linker length on hydrogen bond system and, therefore, crystal packing and the structure of species in solution was revealed for phosphorylalkanols Ph2P(O) (CR2)nCH2CH(OH)Me (where n = 0 (5); n = 1, R = H (6); and n = 1, R = Me (7)). The character of hydrogen bonding in solution was found to affect the extraction properties of the phosphorylalkanols 5–7 [1]. The aim of this work is to study molecular and crystal structure of phosphorylalkanols 2–4 and the character of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in crystal and solution depending on linker length, as well as the effect of structure on anticancer activity. Crystals were studied by X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy. The latter method is the most suitable spectral technique to study hydrogen bonding and provides a possibility to compare species structure in crystal and solution. Furthermore, the structure of the studied compounds was juxtaposed with their cytotoxicity."
1,Experimental,
2,General,"2.1 General Solvents were purified by the standard procedures [39]. Deuteriochloroform (99.8% D, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as received. Tris[2-(2′-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (2) [34], tris[2-(3′-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (3) [35], and tris[2-(4′-hydroxybutoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (4) [36] were obtained and purified by the known procedures. Crystalline samples of alcohols 2–4 were prepared by crystallization from chloroform. Solutions for spectral studies were prepared by volumetric/gravimetric method. It should be noted that only triol 4 is rather soluble in chloroform. Triol 3 is markedly less soluble, while triol 2 is the worst soluble. As a whole, the solubility of the triols in chloroform decreases in the order 4 > 3 > 2. NMR spectra of alcohols 2–4 are given below.

3,IR spectra,"2.2 IR spectra IR spectra were registered on a Bruker Tensor 37 FTIR spectrometer with 2 cm−1 resolution. The spectra of crystalline samples were obtained in KBr pellets in the range 400–4000 cm−1. The spectra of solutions in CDCl3 (c = 0.02, 0.001 M) were recorded in the range 1000–4000 cm−1, cuvettes (CaF2) with 0.22 and 1 mm path length were used. The spectra of solutions in CHCl3 (c = 0.001 M) were recorded in the range 2000–4000 cm−1, cuvettes (NaCl) with 10 mm path length were used."
4,X-ray crystallography,"2.3 X-ray crystallography Single crystals of compounds 2–4 suitable for X-ray crystallography were obtained by the isothermal solvent evaporation of saturated chloroform solution. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out with a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer (graphite monochromated Mo-K α radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å, ω-scan technique, 120 K). The structures were solved by direct methods and refined in anisotropic approximation for non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogens atoms of methylene and aromatic fragments were calculated according to those idealized geometry and refined with constraints applied to C–H and O–H bond lengths and equivalent displacement parameters (Ueq(H) = 1.2Ueq(X), X is the central atom of XH2 group). All structures were solved with the ShelXT program [40] and refined with the ShelXL program [41]. Molecular graphics was drawn using OLEX2 program [42]. CCDC 1944525, 1944523, and 1944524, contains the supplementary crystallographic data for compounds 2, 3, and 4, respectively. These data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures. Table 1 displays experimental details and crystallographic data for compounds 2–4. Table 2 shows parameters of hydrogen bonds for compounds 2–4."
5,Cytotoxicity in vitro in MTT assay,"2.4 Cytotoxicity in vitro in MTT assay Human cell cultures A549 and HeLa were grown in DMEM (for A549) and EMEM (for HeLa) media with addition of 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM l-glutamine and 1% Gentamicin as an antibiotic at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in wet atmosphere. A549 and HeLa cells were seeded at concentration 1∙104 cells/200 μL in a 96-well plate and cultivated in a 5% CO2 damp atmosphere at 37 °C. After 72 h incubation, different concentrations of the tested compounds were added to the cell cultures (from 100 to 1.56 μM) and the cells were cultivated under the same conditions for 72 h. Assay for each concentration was repeated three times. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, final DMSO concentration in well was not higher 0.1% and was not toxic for the cells. Wells with solvent at final concentration of 0.1% were used as references. After incubation, 20 μL of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5 mg/mL) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for additional 2 h. Next, the medium was removed from the plates and 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve resultant formazan crystals. Optical density at 536 nm was determined using a BioTek Instruments Cytation 3 Imager plate analyzer. Concentration resulting in 50% cell growth inhibition (IC50, μM) was determined from dose-dependent curves using OriginPro 9.0 software."
6,Results and discussion,"The structure of compounds 2, 3, and 4 was confirmed by multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H}) and IR spectroscopy and unambiguously established by X-ray diffraction study."
7,"NMR spectra of compounds 2, 3, and 4","3.1 NMR spectra of compounds 2, 3, and 4 As a whole, the NMR spectra of the studied compounds agree well with the proposed structure. 1H NMR spectra of compounds 2, 3, and 4 in the region of aliphatic protons of the side arms show the signals of the methylene protons H(1′) of ArOCH 2 fragment as a broad singlet (for compound 2) at 4.12 ppm or triplets (for compounds 3 and 4) at 4.12 or 3.9–4.1 ppm, respectively, (3 J HH = 5.2–5.6 Hz). The signals of the methylene protons H(2′) of ArOCH2CH 2 fragment appear as a broad singlet (compound 2) at 3.63 ppm or as a quintet (for compound 3) at 1.68 ppm (3 J HH = 5.5 Hz). In the case of compound 4, the signals of H(2′) and H(3′) have the same chemical shifts and appear as a quintet at 1.48 ppm (3 J HH = 6.0 Hz). The proton signal of the terminal CH 2OH groups is a broad singlet (for 2) at 3.63 ppm or triplets (for 3 and 4) at 3.51–3.47 ppm (3 J HH = 5.2 Hz). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds 2, 3, and 4 display the proton signals of the OH groups as broad singlets at 4.07–4.31 ppm. The signals of aromatic protons H(3) and H(5) of compounds 2 and 4 appear as overlapping multiplets at 6.80–7.15 and 6.83–7.00 ppm, respectively. Similarly, the signals of aromatic protons H(4) and H(6) for compound 4 appear as overlapping multiplets at 7.35–7.53 ppm, whereas those for compound 2 are resolved as a triplet at 7.56 ppm and a doublet of doublets at 7.40 ppm. Well-resolved signals are also observed for the aromatic protons of compound 3: the signals of H(3), H(4), H(5) and H(6) appear at 7.03 (dd), 7.52 (t), 6.99 (td), and 7.30 ppm (dd), respectively. Spin–spin coupling constants have common values: 7–8 Hz for3 J HH and 2–15 Hz for J HP. 13C{1H} NMR spectra of compounds 2, 3, and 4 display common values of chemical shifts for the signals of aliphatic (25–72 ppm) and aromatic carbon nuclei (119–135 ppm). In contrast to aliphatic carbons signals as singlets, all aromatic carbon resonances appear as doublets due to 13C–31P spin–spin coupling with J CP = 1–2 Hz for C(2) and C(4), J CP = 6–13 Hz for C(3), C(5) and C(6), and J CP = 111–120 Hz for C(1). 31P{1H} NMR spectra of compounds 2, 3, and 4 show singlet signals within 29–32 ppm, typical value for triarylphosphine oxides."
8,General structural features of compounds 2–4 according to X-ray diffraction data,"3.2 General structural features of compounds 2–4 according to X-ray diffraction data Generally, the bond distances and angles in the studied compounds have common values like in other organic compounds. Molecules of compounds 2–4 have similar conformation of unsymmetrical propeller with 2-UP orientation of the side groups in the benzene rings. In this conformation, two ortho substituents are oriented to the same direction as the PO group, whereas the third substituent is directed to the opposite side (Fig. 1 ). The PO group lays almost in the plane of the benzene ring whose substituent is turned to the side opposite to the PO group (OPCC torsion angles are from 167 to 176°), while the planes of two other rings almost coincides with the bisectorial planes of the corresponding OPC angles (OPCC torsion angles are from 45 to 67°). In all triols 2–4, the PO groups are involved in formation of one or two hydrogen bonds with OH groups. As a whole, bond distances and valence angles for all triols have common values for organic compounds, except for the length of the PO bond, which is considerably longer than that in compounds producing no hydrogen bonds and close to the lengths in compounds with hydrogen bonds (see Table 3 )."
9,Structure and bonding in tris[2-(2′-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (2),"3.3 Structure and bonding in tris[2-(2′-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (2) 3.3.1 X-ray crystallography for tris[2-(2′-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide 2 Fig. 2 shows the molecular structure of triol 2 solvate with chloroform (1 : 1 composition) in single crystal. Unit cell of triol 2 solvate contains two independent molecules involved in two diverse hydrogen-bonded chains. The PO bond vectors in neighboring chains have opposite orientation, while the propeller blades of the benzene rings in these molecules are turned to the opposite directions (like left and right helices) (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Each phosphoryl group forms two different in length intramolecular hydrogen bonds with two alkanol arms. The oxygen atom of one of these arms forms the shortest intermolecular hydrogen bond with hydrogen atom of free alkanol arm of neighboring molecule (Table 3). These intermolecular bonds unite triol 2 molecules to give a linear two-chain motif. The chains are structured in such a manner that the PO bond vectors in each chain lay on one axis. 3.3.2 IR characterization of tris[2-(2′-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide 2 Hydrogen bonding between phosphoryl and hydroxyl groups leads to low-frequency shifts of ν(Р = О) and ν(О–Н) bands, which correlate with H-bonding strength [44,45]. In phosphine oxide [2-Bu2NC(O)CH2OC6H4]3PO (8) related to triol 2, the phosphoryl group is free and ν(PO) is 1181 cm−1 [43,46]. The formation of ordinary intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen bond PO∙∙∙HO in phosphorylalkanols 5–7 leads to decrease in ν(PO) frequency to 1170–1150 cm−1, Δν(Р = О) = 20–40 cm−1 [1]. Upon trifurcate association PO∙∙∙3HO revealed in triol 1, Δν(PO) is more than 100 cm−1 [27]. The same decrease in ν(PO) frequency results from the trifurcate hydrogen bonding of the phosphoryl oxygen with the phenol OH groups in tris(2-hydroxyphenyl)phosphine oxide (2-HOC6H4)3P = O [47]. The IR spectrum of crystalline triol 2, whose molecule contains a bifurcate intramolecular hydrogen bond, displays ν(PO) at 1090 cm−1 (Table 4 ), that is, the decrease of frequency is ∼100 cm−1. The vibrations ν(ОН) of hydroxyl groups producing intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds of different length appear as a broad composite band with maximum at 3338 cm−1 with feebly marked high-frequency shoulder about 3400 cm−1 and low-frequency shoulder at 3260 cm−1 (Table 4). We make no strict correspondence between ν(OH) frequencies and bond lengths because this correlation is often violated because of hydrogen bond nonlinearity and effect of crystal packing [44,45]. As a rule, dissolution causes chain disintegration owing to breaking intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In triol 2, the chains result from intermolecular hydrogen bonding of hydroxyl groups and their breaking could be detected by the emergence of bands of free OH groups. However, the spectrum of 0.02 M solution shows no such bands. Instead of them, a band at 3575 cm−1 appears, which can be assigned to the vibrations of associated hydroxyl groups because the dimers of aliphatic alcohols have close vibrational frequencies [44,45]. Like the spectrum of crystalline sample, solution spectrum displays ν(Р = О) band of a bifurcate associate (1090 cm−1). Therefore, one can suppose that monomers with bifurcate intramolecular hydrogen bond are associated into dimers I similarly to aliphatic alcohols (Scheme 2 ). Furthermore, solution spectrum displays a new band at 1152 cm−1, which is typical for PO group with one hydrogen bond [1], i.e., a cleavage of one intramolecular hydrogen bond occurs. Taking into account the lack of bands of free OH groups, we can suppose the formation of another alcohol dimer II (Scheme 2). A broad non-resolved band with maximum about 3330 cm−1 belongs to the ν(ОН) vibrations of hydroxyl groups producing intramolecular hydrogen bonds with phosphoryl oxygen. Thus, the concentrated solution of triol 2 contains an equilibrium mixture of alcohol dimers I and II. Dilution of the solution causes the emergence of the band of free OH groups at 3620 cm−1, the band of alcohol dimer transforms into its weak shoulder, while ν(Р = О) band intensities are redistributed toward the PO group with one hydrogen bond. This fact indicates that dilution leads to formation of monomers that form two types of intramolecular hydrogen bonds: ordinary (monomer III) and bifurcate (monomer IV); furthermore, a small content of dimer, most likely of type II, retains (Scheme 2)."
10,Structure and bonding in tris[2-(3′-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (3),"3.4 Structure and bonding in tris[2-(3′-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (3) 3.4.1 X-ray crystallography for tris[2-(3′-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide 3 The molecular structure of triol 3 solvate (2 : 1) with chloroform is shown in Fig. 4 . Triol 3 crystal contains two types of molecules that differ in the number and type of hydrogen bonds. The molecules of the first type (A) produce one intramolecular and five intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The second type of molecules (B) forms five intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In the molecules of type A, the phosphoryl group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with one of the hydroxyl groups. Two other hydroxyl groups produce intermolecular contacts OH⋯OH with the hydroxyl groups of two neighboring molecules of type B so that the molecules of type A and B couple to form a cyclic dimer containing a solvent molecule in a void (Fig. 4). The vectors of the PO groups of A and B type molecules in the formed dimeric motif are antiparallel. The dimers associate via two OH∙∙∙OP hydrogen bonds to produce a tricyclic tetramer, which constitutes a unit cell containing four molecules of triol 3, by two molecules of each type. The tetrameric associates unite via OH⋯OH contacts between the hydroxyl groups into chain dimeric motif to produce zigzag ribbon-like infinite chains (Fig. 5 ). The ribbons combine to each other via OH⋯OH hydrogen bonds to form a two-dimensional network. 3.4.2 IR characterization of tris[2-(3′-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide 3 The IR spectrum of crystalline triol 3 displays a band with maximum at 1169 cm−1 and a low-frequency shoulder at ∼1160 cm−1, which can be assigned to the vibrations of PO groups involved in the formation of simple hydrogen bonds in molecules of type I (intermolecular hydrogen bond) and II (intramolecular hydrogen bond). For example, ν(Р = О) = 1169 cm−1 for crystalline phosphorylalkanol 5 whose molecules form a cyclic dimer, while the spectrum of phosphorylalkanol 7 with intramolecular hydrogen bond shows ν(Р = О) = 1151 cm−1 [1]. The ν(ОН) vibrations of the hydroxyl groups appear as a broad band with maxima at 3370 and 3246 cm−1 and a shoulder at 3150 cm−1 (Table 4). The spectrum of 0.02 M solution displays an absorption maximum of ν(Р = О) at 1155 cm−1, which corresponds to the PO group with one hydrogen bond PO⋯H. In the region of ν(OH) absorbance, as distinct from triol 2, the band of free OH groups (3620 cm−1) appears even at this concentration. At the same time, a weak absorption is observed at 3575 cm−1, which indicates the contact between the hydroxyl groups like in triol 2. The body of these data allows us to suppose that the dissolution of triol 3 leads to the decomposition of OH⋯O intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the molecules of type I and II (Fig. 4) and emergence of molecules with PO⋯HO intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are associated into alcohol dimers of type II or V (Scheme 2). The band with maximum at 3370 cm−1 belongs to the ν(ОН) vibrations of hydroxyl groups in these associates. The molecules of type II in solution seem to retain the structure of cyclic dimer of type VI, which agrees well with the bands ν(PO) at 1155 cm−1 and ν(OH) at 3240 cm−1 (Scheme 2). Dilution decomposes the above dimers (bands at 3575 and 3240 cm−1 disappear), while the band of free OH groups (3620 cm−1) becomes stronger. In the region of PO vibrations, a slight absorption at 1090 cm−1, related to the phosphoryl group bound in bifurcate mode, is observed along with the band at 1155 cm−1. Consequently, the diluted solution of triol 3 contains an equilibrium mixture of monomers III and IV similarly to the diluted solution of triol 2."
11,Structure and bonding in tris[2-(4′-hydroxybutoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (4),"3.5 Structure and bonding in tris[2-(4′-hydroxybutoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide (4) 3.5.1 X-ray crystallography for tris[2-(4′-hydroxybutoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide 4 Fig. 6 displays the molecular structure of triol 4, which is similar to the structure of compound 2 (Fig. 2) and contains two intramolecular PO⋯H hydrogen bonds and one intermolecular OH⋯OH hydrogen bond. The number of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the molecules of triols 4 and 2 are the same and produce chain motifs but their packing differs. The molecules of triol 4 are associated by intermolecular OH⋯OH hydrogen bonds and form chains in such a manner that unit cell includes four molecules: two molecules from each neighboring chain (Figs. 6 and 7 ), whereas the unit cell of triol 2 includes two molecules: by one molecule from each chain (Fig. 3). The difference also consists in that the vectors of PO bonds in the each chain of triol 2 lie along one line, while the vectors of the PO bonds in the chains of compound 4 are oriented in two manners so that the chains have zigzag conformation and the PO vectors of neighboring chains are pairwise oriented to the opposite directions. 3.5.2 IR spectral characterization of tris[2-(4′-hydroxybutoxy)phenyl]phosphine oxide 4 IR spectra of crystalline triol 4 are similar to those of crystalline triol 2: the band ν(P = О) at 1090 cm−1 agrees well with the bifurcate H bond of phosphoryl oxygen, the position of ν(ОН) band is also close to that for triol 2. Distinct difference between triols 4 and 2 appears on dissolution. The spectrum of 0.02 M solution of triol 4 shows the conservation of the band of PO group associated in bifurcate mode (1090 cm−1) and the corresponding ν(ОН) band at 3300 cm−1 and the emergence of the band of free OH group (3620 cm−1). This fact indicates that dissolution causes destruction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups to form monomers of type IV with bifurcate intramolecular hydrogen bond even in concentrated solution (Scheme 2). When solution was diluted, the spectrum displayed the bands of PO groups with single and bifurcate H bonds and the bands of free and associated OH groups (Table 4), i.e., monomers III with simple H bond were detected (Scheme 2). Thus, the analysis of spectral data shows that the predictable cleavage of intermolecular H bond occurred in solution; the monomers with ordinary (III) and bifurcate (IV) intramolecular H bond are in equilibrium at both high and low concentrations. Thus, the comparison of X-ray diffraction and IR spectral data shows that linker length in akin triols 2–4 affects not only crystal structure but also the structure of species in solution. The chemical structures of triols 2 and 4 are similar but they have different crystal packing and diverse structure of species in concentrated solution: triol 2 prefers to form chain alcohol dimer, while triol 4 exists as a monomer. Triol 3 differs from its analogs by more complex crystal structure and produces more complicated equilibrium in a concentrated solution. In dilute solutions, all the triols exist as monomers with simple and bifurcate intramolecular hydrogen bond, but equilibrium between these forms is also dependent on linker length: the concentration of molecules with bifurcate bond decreases in the series of triols 2 > 3 > 4."
12,The study of cytotoxicity in vitro,"3.6 The study of cytotoxicity in vitro The studied triols 2–4 were tested for cytotoxic activity against lung (A549) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines. Obtained results are given in Table 5 . The table shows that the activity of the studied triols is lower than that of reference (Camptothecin). The cytotoxicity of the studied compounds increases with side chain length in the order 2 < 3 < 4. This feature is observed for both cell lines. We obtained IR spectra of solutions of triols 2, 3, and 4 in wet DMSO. This solvent destroys intermolecular hydrogen bonds and may simulate very dilute solutions in cells where intermolecular hydrogen bond is impossible due to dilution. The structure of species in DMSO differs. The spectrum of triol 2 shows the lack of band of free PO group and the presence of bands of PO groups involved in simple or bifurcate intramolecular H-bond (1155 and ∼1100 cm−1, respectively). The spectrum of triol 4 contains the band of only free PO group (at 1182 cm−1), while the spectrum of triol 3 displays an intermediate picture (see Fig. S4 in Supplementary data). Thus, the content of molecules with free functional groups increases in the same order as cytotoxicity: 2 < 3 < 4. The studied triols most likely are not the primary cytotoxic agents, but they can undergo metabolism to form more cytotoxic compounds. If so, the observed order of inhibiting concentration of the triols may result from the rate of their activation (most likely under the action of oxidases), which correlates with the availability of free PO groups possibly required for compound activation. This assumption, however, requires further investigation."
13,Conclusions,"We have studied the molecular and crystal structure of phosphoryl alkanols 2–4, the structure and character of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in crystal and solution depending on linker length. Molecules of compounds 2–4 in crystal have similar conformation of unsymmetrical propeller with 2-UP conformation of the side arm in the benzene rings. All crystals have an extended system of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Insignificant variation in linker length in the side arms on passing to the next homolog has a considerable effect on crystal packing: compounds 2 and 4 forms linear and zigzag chains, respectively, while compound 3 produces ribbons united into 2D networks. The dissolution of triols 2–4 in chloroform causes disintegration of crystal structure to form monomers, linear and cyclic dimers with simple and bifurcate intramolecular H bonds. Upon dilution, triol 2 forms rather stable alcohol dimers persistent even in dilute solution, while triol 4 exists as a monomer. Triol 3 has intermediate properties in association extent. The studied compounds showed insignificant anticancer activity."
