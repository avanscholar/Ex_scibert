0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy carrier and is considered a potential platform fuel for future power generation alternatives such as fuel cells. Hydrogen is industrially produced primarily from natural gas and petroleum oil fractions, as they are currently the most economically feasible raw materials. However, hydrogen production methods utilizing renewable biomass resources that can mitigate environmental impacts are expected to gradually expand. Bio-glycerol is produced as a byproduct of biodiesel synthesis via transesterification of natural oils usually with C1–C4 alcohols [1]. The increasing biodiesel production in recent years has resulted in excess production of bio-glycerol (stoichiometrically 10 wt% in biodiesel production). Meanwhile, the current market is not able to support the purification cost of crude bio-glycerol for the current major uses including food additives, cosmetics, and surfactants [2]. In this respect, the production of hydrogen from bio-glycerol is beneficial both for fuel cell and biofuel areas as a result of the synergistic utilization of the renewable resources resulting in biodiesel cost competitiveness and fuel sustainability for fuel cells. Hydrogen can be produced from glycerol by catalytic reforming with steam [3,4], oxidative steam [5], or an autothermal method [6,7]. Glycerol steam reforming (C3H8O3 + 3H2O ⇄ 3CO2 + 7H2), which can be expressed as a combination of glycerol dehydrogenation (C3H8O3 ⇄ 3CO + 4H2) and the water–gas shift reaction (CO + H2O ⇄ CO2 + H2), produces a higher hydrogen concentration in the products than other methods and can be carried out in the vapor or liquid phase depending on the reaction temperature and pressure. A few reviews of recent studies of utilizing glycerol reforming to produce hydrogen can be found in the literature [8–10]. The catalysts used for the glycerol reforming are largely based on group VIII metals including Ni [11–16], Co [17,18], Pt [19–24], Rh [25], Ir [26], and Ru [27–30] supported on various metal oxides and activated carbon [28,31]. The promoter or bimetallic effects of these catalysts such as Ni promoted by Pt, Ir, Pd, and Ru [32], bimetallic Co–Ni [33–35], Pt–Re [36,37], and Pt- with Ru, Fe, Cu, Sn, Ir, Co, Ni, and Rh [38] have also been investigated. However, studies on supported Ru-based catalysts for glycerol steam reforming are limited even though ruthenium is reported to offer a high catalytic activity for hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon steam reforming with a rate comparable to those obtained using precious Rh- and Pt-based catalysts [28,39]. In a recent study, we also demonstrated excellent performance of a Ru-based catalyst for natural gas steam reforming for hydrogen production, which exhibited a high efficiency and long term stability in a commercial scale fuel processor in a micro-combined-heat-and-power (m-CHP) PEM fuel cell system [40]. Herein, we studied the catalytic properties of Ru and bimetallic Ru–Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, Y2O3, and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. The group VIII metals of Fe, Co, and Ni are known to have high catalytic activity for fuel reforming, but their catalysts often suffer from significant deactivation. Supported bimetallic Ru–Mo catalysts were investigated because Pt-MoOx nanoclusters exhibited an order of magnitude higher catalytic activity for methanol steam reforming at low temperatures compared to Pt-, Ni-, and Cu-based catalysts that demonstrate superior catalytic activity in fuel reforming [41]. The effects of the supports on the glycerol conversion rate, product selectivity, and stability of the catalysts were also thoroughly investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalysts investigated for glycerol steam reforming were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Y2O3 (Alfa), Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, and γ-Al2O3 (Aldrich) supports with aqueous solutions of ruthenium and secondary metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) precursors. The Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 was prepared by a co-precipitation method. A 200 ml of 0.3 M aqueous ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (Alfa, 99%) solution was mixed with an equivalent amount of 0.3 M Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 (Daejung, 99%) solution in a beaker at RT with vigorous stirring. The pH of this mixture solution was continuously adjusted at 9.0 by dropwise addition of an aqueous ammonia solution (0.1 M). The resultant was washed with distilled water, filtered, dried at 383 K, and calcined in air at 973 K for 1 h (ramp rate = 10 K min−1). The metal precursors used for the catalysts were ruthenium chloride hydrate (RuCl3·H2O, Alfa), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Alfa), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Alfa), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)2·9H2O, Duksan), and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Alfa). The loading amounts of Ru as well as the secondary Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) metals were varied to investigate the effects of metal dispersion and the Me/Ru atomic ratio on the reaction rate and selectivity. The impregnated samples were dried at 373 K for 24 h and calcined at 973 K in air for 4 h (ramp rate = 10 K min−1). The resultant catalyst powders were pelletized and sieved in sizes between 250 and 425 μm for the utilization in the glycerol steam reforming in a packed bed reactor."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The compositions of the catalysts were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, JY-70Plus, Jobin-Yvon). The surface areas of the catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption in a volumetric unit (NOVA 2200e, Quantachrome) after degassing the samples under vacuum at 523 K for 3 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained using monochromic Cu-Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a step size of 0.05° and a scan rate of 1 step s−1 (AXS diffractometer D8, Bruker). The surface morphologies of the fresh and spent catalysts were obtained by field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, Tecnai-F20) operated at 200 kV. The reduction characteristics of the catalysts were obtained by temperature programmed reduction (TPR, ramp rate = 10 K min−1) of the samples in an automated measurement unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (AutoChem 2910, Micromeritics). Metal dispersion on the reduced catalysts was estimated from the CO chemisorption uptake amount of the samples obtained at 308 K after in situ reduction of the sample in H2 at 873 K for 1 h followed by purging under He flow for 2 h. The amount of carbon deposition on the catalysts due to the glycerol reforming was characterized by using a thermogravimetric analysis apparatus (Pyris 1TGA, Perkin Elmer). The analysis was carried out by heating the sample (0.015 g) from RT to 1123 K (ramp = 10 K min−1) under air flowing at 20 cm3 min−1 (NTP)."
4,Glycerol steam reforming,"2.3 Glycerol steam reforming Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the reactor setup used for the catalytic glycerol steam reforming. The reaction was conducted at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed quartz glass reactor with a tubular geometry, an outside diameter (OD) of 10 mm, a wall thickness of 1 mm (ID = 8 mm), and a length of 450 mm. The catalysts were pelletized to diameters of 250–425 μm and packed in the middle of the reactor while fixing the bed position using a fritted disk and quartz wool. The amount of packed catalyst in the reactor was varied between 0.1 and 0.5 g, and the inlet flow rate of the reactants was adjusted in order to keep the glycerol conversion level on the catalysts within 20–40%. This minimizes the effects of different glycerol conversion levels on the assessments of the reaction rates obtained with the different catalysts. The reactor was installed vertically in a PID-controlled tubular electric furnace (400 mm length). The temperature of the reactor was measured and isothermally controlled by attaching a K-type thermocouple onto the outside reactor wall at the catalyst bed section. Before the reforming reaction, the catalysts were reduced in situ in flowing H2 (50 ml min−1) at 873 K for 1 h and subsequently purged in He (50 ml min−1) for 0.5 h. The reforming reaction was carried out by introducing a 30 wt% glycerol/water reactant mixture solution (H2O/C3H8O molar ratio = 12) at various feed rates using an HPLC pump (Series II, LabAlliance) under a carrier gas (1 mol% N2/balance He). The liquid reactants were evaporated through a pre-evaporator that was isothermally maintained at 573 K. The ratio of the glycerol feed rate to the catalyst loading amount (F/W) was between 290 and 2300 μmol gcat −1 min−1. The effluents were passed through a condenser maintained at 273 K to separate the condensable products. The gaseous products were analyzed online using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) equipped gas chromatograph (7890A, Agilent technologies). The condensed effluent was collected after completion of the reaction and analyzed separately using a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped gas chromatograph (7890A, Agilent technologies). The reaction was conducted at two different temperatures of 723 and 873 K. The glycerol conversion to gaseous products and the product selectivity were calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2). The hydrogen production turnover rate (h−1) was calculated by dividing the H2 production rate (mol gcat −1 h−1) by the number of surface active sites on the catalysts obtained by the CO chemisorption (mol gcat −1). (1) Glycerol conversion ( % ) = C moles in the gas products C moles in the glycerol feed × 100 (2) Product selectivity ( % ) = moles of each product total moles of gas products × 100"
5,Results and discussion,"The supports used for the Ru and Ru–Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) catalysts were Y2O3, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, and γ-Al2O3 with BET surface areas of 6, 53, and 92 m2 g−1, respectively. Table 1 shows the glycerol conversion rate and product selectivity on the supported Ru (Ru = 1.0 wt%) and Ru–Me (Ru = 1.0 wt%, Me/Ru atomic ratio = 1.0) catalysts obtained at (a) 873 K and (b) 723 K, respectively. Oxygenated hydrocarbon species such as acetaldehyde, acrolein, and propanol were observed in the condensed products, but the selectivity of these species was negligible (less than 1.0%), as estimated by a material balance calculation. The main products formed by the reaction were H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 with small amounts of higher hydrocarbons such as C2H4 and C2H6. The nature of the support markedly affected the glycerol conversion rate where much higher glycerol conversion rates were exhibited on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported catalysts compared to the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts. For example, the conversion rate on Ru/Y2O3 was approximately four times greater than that on Ru/γ-Al2O3 at 873 K, and the rate followed the order of Ru/Y2O3 > Ru/Ce0.5Zr0.5 O 2 > Ru/γ-Al2O3. This order was also the same at 723 K with a much enhanced glycerol conversion rate on Ru/Y2O3. The effects of Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo promoter species on the glycerol conversion rate and product selectivity on the supported Ru–Me catalysts were different depending on the support and reaction temperature. Briefly, the effects of Fe on the glycerol conversion rate on the Ru–Fe catalysts were antagonistic or limited where the rates on the Ru–Fe/Ce0.5Ze0.5O2 and Ru–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were much lower than that on the monometallic Ru catalyst counterparts at 873 K. Meanwhile, at 723 K, the rates on the Ru–Fe catalysts were similar to those on the Ru catalysts and did not depend on the support. A promotion effect of Co on the glycerol conversion rate was observed on Ru–Co/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 at 723 K. Similarly, moderate enhancements of the glycerol conversion rate were observed on the Ru–Ni/Y2O3 and Ru–Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalysts, both at 723 and 873 K. Noticeably, the rates on the supported Ru–Mo catalysts were much lower than those on the Ru catalysts and did not depend on the type of support or temperature. In our previous study, we reported marked promotion effects of Mo on supported Pt-MoO x catalysts for methanol steam reforming at low temperatures, in which partially reducible Mo species from the Mo6+ to Mo5+ redox transition contributed an order of magnitude enhancement to the methanol conversion turnover rate to hydrogen compared to supported Pt catalysts [41]. The large dissimilarity of the effects of Mo for glycerol steam reforming appears to be attributed to the difference in the oxidation states of the Mo constituents. For the elevated glycerol reforming temperatures applied in this work, the Mo moieties on the Ru–Mo catalysts existed in the oxidation states lower than Mo5+, which preferentially promoted formation of CO and hydrocarbon products. The H2 product selectivity was also considerably higher on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported Ru-based catalysts than the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts. The enhancement of the H2 selectivity was particularly noticeable at the lower temperature of 723 K, where it was approximately two folds greater on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported catalysts. On the contrary, the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts exhibited the formation of a relatively large amount of CO and C1–C2 hydrocarbons with a compromised H2 selectivity. The notably greater H2 selectivity with small amounts of CO and C1–C2 hydrocarbons formation on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported Ru-based catalysts demonstrates significant contributions of the reducible oxide supports for the formation of H2 products. This favorable selectivity enhancements was attributed to the facilitation of the water–gas shift reaction (WGSR, CO + H2O ⇄ CO2 + H2), as evidenced from the composition of the reaction products. Fig. 2 displays the CO2/CO molar ratio in the reforming products on the supported Ru and Ru–Me catalysts at (a) 873 K and (b) 723 K, respectively. The results clearly indicate a markedly higher CO2/CO product ratio on the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Y2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts regardless of the composition of the dispersed metal moieties. The enhanced H2 selectivity and higher CO2/CO product ratio suggest facilitation of the WGSR that forms additional H2 and CO2 via the reaction of CO with H2O. Catalytic promotion effects of reducible metal oxides such as CeO2 and TiO2 in the WGSR have been reported on supported Pt, Cu, and Ni catalysts, in which H2O activation on the reducible metal oxide supports was suggested to be the reason for the facilitated CO oxidation on the adjacent metal clusters [42,43]. On the contrary, the formation of hydrocarbon species increased on the γ-Al2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts, as the acidic surface properties of γ-Al2O3 promoted the C–O bond cleavage of the reaction intermediates, which leads to the formation of C1–C2 hydrocarbon products. As will be discussed later, the extent of coking on the γ-Al2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts was also much higher than on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported counterparts, agreeing with previous studies that reported facilitated coke formation on alumina supported Rh, Ni, and Co–Ni catalysts used in glycerol steam reforming [25,34]. The physicochemical properties of the supported Ru and Ru–Me catalysts were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and pulsed CO chemisorption methods. The XRD results for the reduced Ru and Ru–Me catalysts exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the crystallized metal oxide supports but did not show peaks corresponding to Ru, the promoter metals, or Ru–Me alloys, indicating that the impregnated metallic moieties were finely dispersed over the surface of the supports. Fig. 3 displays the TPR characteristics of Ru, Me, and Ru–Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni, Mo) catalysts supported on (a) Y2O3, (b) Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, and (c) γ-Al2O3. The small reduction peaks observed at approximately 740, 885, and 1010 K on Y2O3 and 770 K on Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 indicate that these supports were partially reducible at the glycerol reforming temperatures applied in this work. Fig. 3a and 3b shows that the reduction characteristics of the Ru–Me moieties formed on Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 differed considerably from the monometallic Ru and Me moieties dispersed on the same supports. The results also reveal that the reduction of Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo species on the bimetallic Ru–Me catalysts occurred at much lower temperatures than their monometallic counterparts, indicating close interactions between Ru and the promoter metals likely forming solid solution states. On the other hand, the reduction characteristics of the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts shown in Fig. 3c are largely different. It is notable that the reduction of the monometallic Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo species occurred at temperatures above 1000 K and similar reduction peaks were observed separately on the bimetallic Ru–Me catalysts. The results suggest that considerable amounts of the impregnated metal species preferentially interacted with the alumina support, forming catalytically less active moieties for glycerol reforming, as the formation of metal aluminates on alumina supported Ni, Co, and Fe catalysts has been previously reported [12,34,44,45]. A quantitative analysis on the hydrogen consumption for the reduction peaks presented on the alumina supported Ru-based catalysts revealed that the relative amounts of the promoter metals that were consumed for the formation of metal aluminates were significant with the values between 9 and 38% (Ne = 38, Co = 32, Fe = 9%). Table 2 shows the CO chemisorption amounts on the supported Ru (1.0 wt%) and Ru–Me (Ru = 1.0 wt%, Me/Ru atomic ratio = 1.0) catalysts. The CO chemisorption amounts were generally greater on the Y2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts followed by the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, which is not correlated to the surface area of the supports. The relatively low CO uptakes on the γ-Al2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts were reasonable considering the strong interactions of the dispersed metal species with the alumina support, which formed the metal-aluminates that were irreducible at 873 K, as previously discussed with the TPR results. The higher CO chemisorption amounts on the Ru–Co, Ru–Ni, and Ru–Fe catalysts compared to the monometallic Ru catalysts indicated an additive contribution of the promoter metals for the surface number density of the active sites. In order to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the catalysts taking into account the different active metal dispersions, the H2 production turnover rates were compared in Fig. 4 at two different temperatures of (a) 873 K and (b) 723 K. The results collectively suggest that the glycerol reaction turnover to hydrogen was largely facilitated on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported catalysts compared to the γ-Al2O3 supported counterparts with rate increments ranging from several fold to an order of magnitude. These results reflect a significant contribution of the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supports to the enhancement of the glycerol reaction turnover to hydrogen, particularly on the Ru–Ni and Ru–Fe catalysts at the low temperature of 723 K. Differently, the contributions of the promoter Co, Mo, Ni, and Fe metals to the glycerol conversion rate to hydrogen on the bimetallic Ru–Me catalysts were limited. Briefly, the H2 production turnover rates on the bimetallic Ru–Me catalysts were similar or slightly less than those on the monometallic Ru counterparts, except for Ru–Ni/Y2O3 and Ru–Ni/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, which exhibited some rate enhancements at 723 K. However, it should be pointed out that the H2 production turnover rates on the bimetallic Ru–Ni, Ru–Co, and Ru–Fe catalysts were higher than those on the monometallic Ni, Co, and Fe catalysts under the same reaction conditions. For example, the H2 production turnover rate on the Y2O3 supported monometallic Ni, Co, and Fe catalysts were 15.3, 6.1, and 1.7 s−1, respectively, at 873 K, which are less than the values obtained on the bimetallic Ru–Ni (18.1 s−1), Ru–Co (13.6 s−1), and Ru–Fe (19.3 s−1) counterparts. Although the glycerol steam reforming rate and product selectivity to hydrogen were largely facilitated on the reducible Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supports with small promotional effects attributed to the Co, Ni, and Fe promoter metals, the Ru-based catalysts investigated in this work suffered from severe deactivation. Fig. 5 displays the glycerol conversion rate as a function of the on-stream time obtained at 873 K on the Ru and Ru–Me (Me = Co, Mo, Ni, and Fe) catalysts supported on (a) Y2O3, (b) Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, and (c) γ-Al2O3. These results demonstrate significant deactivation of the catalysts, as evidenced by the considerable decrease of the glycerol conversion rate within several hours of the reaction, and do not clearly show a dependence on the type of support or catalytic constituents. However, the primary reasons for the deactivation of the catalysts were different and could be deduced from a correlation analysis of the deactivation level with the amount and nature of the carbonaceous species formed on the catalysts surface. Fig. 6 shows the level of catalyst deactivation (%) with respect to the amount of carbonaceous species (wt%) deposited on the supported Ru-based catalysts after 10 h of glycerol reforming at 873 K. The deposition amount of carbonaceous species on the surface of the catalysts was measured ex situ by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results reveal that the deposition was relatively severe on the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts with amounts between 14 and 17 wt%, and the level of deactivation of the catalysts was also high in the range of 50–80%. It is also noticeable that these γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts exhibit a roughly linear correlation between the deactivation and the carbon deposition amount with a positive slope, which indicate that the primary reason for the deactivation of the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts is coking. On the contrary, the deposition amounts on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported Ru-based catalysts were insignificant at less than 3 wt%. The nature of the carbonaceous species deposited on the γ-Al2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts was different from that formed on the reducible Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported catalysts, as demonstrated by the vastly different oxidation temperatures of these species. Fig. 7 displays the differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTGA) results on the spent catalysts after 10 h of the glycerol reforming reaction. The results show that oxidation of the formed carbonaceous species on the γ-Al2O3 supported Ru-based catalysts occurred at considerably higher temperatures between 800 and 1000 K, while that on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported catalysts took place below 700 K. The high oxidation temperature of the carbonaceous species formed on the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts suggests that the nature of these species is mostly graphitic. Deactivation of alumina supported catalysts via surface graphitic carbon deposition has generally been reported for glycerol steam reforming, where oxidation of the species was observed at high temperatures above 853 K [46,47]. Differently, the carbon deposition was insignificant on the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported Ru-based catalysts, while deactivation of the catalysts at levels between 15% and 80% was observed depending on the catalyst composition and support. The small amount of easily oxidizable carbonaceous species formed on these catalysts would not cause such significant deactivations at the elevated reforming temperature of 873 K. Instead, the primary reason for deactivation of the Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported Ru-based catalysts was sintering of the dispersed catalytic moieties. Fig. 8 shows FE-TEM images of the (a) fresh and (b) spent Ru/Y2O3 (1 wt% Ru) catalyst after glycerol reforming at 873 K for 10 h. The results indicate that the sizes of the dispersed Ru clusters increased from approximately 1 nm to 4–6 nm after glycerol steam reforming for a relatively short period of 10 h. The oxidation of Ru clusters on the spent catalysts was not observed. The low deactivation level observed on the Ru–Mo catalysts suggests that the dispersed surface MoO x moieties effectively hampered sintering of the dispersed Ru clusters. It has been reported that molybdenum oxides on supported Ni- and Pt-based catalysts promotes the stability of catalysts in hydrocarbon steam reforming by enhancing the dispersion and stability of the surface metal clusters [41,48,49]. In summary, the results obtained in this study collectively suggest that promotion effects of additive Me metals on bimetallic Ru–Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) catalysts on the glycerol conversion turnover rate and product H2 selectivity were limited under high temperature steam reforming conditions. Instead, the nature of the supports considerably affected their catalytic properties exhibiting significant enhancements of the H2 production turnover rates and selectivity on the reducible Y2O3 and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 supported Ru-based catalysts. The redox properties of these supports attributed to the enhancements of the H2 production turnover rate and selectivity via facilitation of the water–gas shift reaction. These catalysts exhibited deactivation mainly due to sintering, while the MoO x surface moieties on the Pt–Mo catalysts enhanced the stability of the catalysts against sintering of the dispersed catalytic metal clusters."
6,Conclusions,"We investigated the catalytic properties of Ru and Ru–Me (Me = Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) catalysts supported on Al2O3, Y2O3, and Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 for hydrogen production by glycerol steam reforming at elevated temperatures. The type of supports markedly affected the glycerol conversion turnover rate and H2 product selectivity, resulting in considerably enhanced rates and selectivities on the reducible yttria and ceria–zirconia supported catalysts attributed to the facilitation of the water–gas shift reaction. It was found that the contributions of the promoter Fe, Co, Ni and Mo metals on the rate and selectivity were limited and did not show noticeable promotion effects. The reducible yttria and ceria-zirconia supports also provided superior properties against coking on the catalysts, although sintering of the dispersed catalytic metal clusters lead to deactivation of the catalysts. The Ru–Mo/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ru–Mo/Y2O3 catalysts exhibited superior stability against deactivation by sintering and the results suggest that surface MoOx moieties effectively decreased the mobility of catalytic metal clusters formed on the support surface even under high temperature reforming conditions."
