0,Introduction,"Periods of rapid socio-economic growth are fuelled by vast quantities of fossil fuels, including crude oil, coal, and natural gas, which are the primary source of energy, currently providing over 90% of the world's energy needs. The US Energy Information Agency report plans to increase world energy usage by 40% between 2018 and 2050. Although annual progress in the development of renewable energy is being made, soon, the use of fossil fuels remains paramount and essential [1–6]. Due to high combustion heat (55.7 kJ g−1) compared to coal (39.3 kJ g−1) and crude oil (43.6 kJ g−1), methane (the main portion of natural gas) has great potential in industrial applications. The carbon/hydrogen ratio of methane is high, resulting in low CO2 emissions (50% less than coal and 30% less than oil) during combustion. This makes natural gas the key energy source of the future to replace oil and coal. Each year, research, and development efforts in various sectors, including industrial, residential, power generation, and transportation, have expanded rapidly, as shown in Fig. 1 [7,8]. As a result, much attention was paid to natural gas, and its consumption increased by 4.6 % in 2018, the highest annual growth rate since 2010, resulting in a shortage of natural gas supplies. The latest estimates indicate that the supply–demand gap will be 200 billion m3 by 2020. It was projected that oil and gas reserves would be limited to 40 to 60 years, and coal resources were estimated in established deposits for approximately 230 years [9–11]. In this respect, natural gas's artificial production is a viable strategic approach for converting syngas (the mixture of CO and H2) derived from coal or biomass gasification through catalytic CO methanation. The produced methane, also known as substitute natural gas (SNG), can be added directly to the natural gas network instead of developing a new bioenergy infrastructure, as shown in Fig. 2 [12,13]. Other methods can also generate SNG, like biological methanation, at low temperatures (up to 70 °C) in trickle-bed reactors or stirred tank reactors [14]. Biomass, including waste, sludge, sewage, and crops, can also be converted to methane (biogas) by anaerobic digestion. Another system used to produce methane from biomass is the hydrothermal gasification process in supercritical water at > 375 °C and > 220 bar. Biomass with water content (>90%) also can be converted to methane in the presence of a suitable catalyst. In other methods, catalytic methanation is performed with a suitable catalyst at high temperatures (above 250 °C) using various rectors, like a fixed-bed, fluid-bed, or slurry-bed reactor [15]. Table 1 summarizes the comparison of bio-thermochemical methanation procedures. In this study, we focus on thermochemical methanation to produce SNG through catalytic CO methanation. Several studies were investigated in the last few decades to explore CO methanation in different catalytic systems. However, the development of robust catalysts for commercialization is still a major challenge for the deactivation of catalysts caused by the deposition of coke and metal sintering. This review provides an inclusive analytical perspective on heterogeneous catalytic systems for the chemical conversion of CO and H2 by CO methanation into methane. Alcohol formation, higher hydrocarbons, dimethyl ethers, formic acids, formats, or photo/electrochemical processes are not discussed in this study. First, we look at the brief history, the chemical reaction, and the thermodynamics of CO methanation. Next, recent advances in catalytic CO methanation systems using various types of metals, supporting materials, preparation methods, and promoters are discussed in detail, focusing on their optimal synergistic relationships with surfaces, basicity, oxygen vacancies, metal-support interaction, reducibility, etc. as shown in Fig. 3 . We also provide an overview of recent developments in metal and promoter-based catalytic systems, as well as the use of various supporting materials. The reaction mechanisms are also reviewed based on theoretical and experimental studies. Current challenges and future perspectives, techno-economic analysis, policy analysis, practical implications of the current study are established, and conclusions are finally provided."
1,"History, reaction chemistry, and thermodynamics of CO methanation","In 1902, Sabatier discovered the CO and CO2 methanation techniques, which had been used for over 100 years in different applications. For example, hydrogen-rich feed gases produced by hydrocarbon reforming are purified from CO impurities through selective CO methanation. To prevent the CO poisons of the Pt anodes in the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell technology, the CO level must be reduced to low concentrations (to 10 ppm) [17–20]. After the oil crisis at the end of the 1970 s, CO methanation is vital for generating SNG to provide an alternative energy source in natural gas from coal-gas. Several ideas were created between the 1970 s and 1980 s, and comprehensive methane studies have been reviewed [13,15]. Interestingly, the subject of CO methanation became one of the top 15 “study fronts” in the '80 s and the first six months of 1982 [21]. This was mainly for a shortage of natural gas and a new interest in producing natural gas from coal gasification, particularly in the US's northern states [17,22]. During this time, several articles have been published on this subject, covering topics ranging from the basic principles of plant reaction to mechanisms. In the catalytic methanation of CO, usually different types of reactors were used, including slurry, fluidized bed, and fixed-bed reactors. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , each reactor has its advantages and disadvantages listed in Table 2 . The chemical conversion of three hydrogen moles and one carbon monoxide mole into one mole of methane and one mole of water is known as CO methanation or CO hydrogenation shown in Eq. (1). It is achieved between 300 and 550 °C at 1 to 100 bars in the presence of an effective catalyst (usually centered on nickel) [13–16]. During the stoichiometric reaction of CO methanation, 206.28 kJmol−1 (2.3 kW) heat and 1 m3 methane are produced per hour, confirming a highly exothermic reaction. CO methanation is additionally characterized by a substantial reactive gas volume contraction that is more than CO2 methanation. The CO methanation volume reduction is 50%, while the CO2 methanation volume reduction is 40 percent [23]. Thermodynamically, CO methanation is a feasible reaction at lower temperatures. (1) C O + 3 H 2 ⇌ C H 4 + H 2 O ; Δ H 298 = - 206.28 k J m o l - 1 Many studies suggest that several side reactions occur during CO methanation, leading to reduced methane selectivity, as shown in Table 3 . During CO methanation, it is possible to decide which product is thermodynamically more stable with high selectivity and yield, thus establishing that optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, H2:CO ratios, and pressure) could boost the formation of methane with minimal impacts of these side reactions. Hussain et al. [24] conducted CO methanation studies and concluded that CH4 formation increased remarkably using a high H2/CO ratio, as shown in Fig. 5 . They also concluded that the use of high pressure significantly increased the formation of methane. Other previous studies have derived similar conclusions [25–30]. Several studies have unanimously concluded that thermodynamically CO methanation is possible at low temperatures. However, at low temperatures, it is limited because there is a greater kinetic barrier of converting oxidized carbon (CO) to reduced form (CH4). Therefore, an efficient catalyst is necessary for CO methanation to meet the kinetic reaction criteria for adequate rates [31,32]."
2,Recent advances in catalytic CO methanation,"The development of CO methanation catalysts is critical in achieving an appropriate reaction rate with high catalytic activity. As a result, various catalysts have been used to perform CO methanation using different active metals and supporting materials. To design an effective catalyst for CO methanation, active metals, supporting materials, preparation methods, and promoters should be considered [13,33,34]."
3,Effect of active metals,"3.1 Effect of active metals When the methanation reactions were discovered, nickel-metal was found to catalyze carbon monoxide and hydrogen reactions substantially. Decades later, numerous metals were found to be actively involved in methanation reactions, particularly groups from 8 to 10 (Fig. 6 ) [13,33]. Fischer et al. [35] performed methanation reactions over various unsupported metals and recorded their operation in the following order: Ag < Pd < Mo < Fe < Pt < Os < Co < Ni < Rh < Ir < Ru. The basic function of the respective metals in order of Ir < Pt < Pd < Rh < Co < Ni < Pt < Ru was also stated by Vannice et al. The selectivity was observed in the order of Pd > Pt > Ir > Ni > Rh > Co > Fe > Ru [36]. Mills et al. have shortened these metals and recorded another activity order as follows: Mo < Co < Ni < Fe < Ru and selectivity: Ru > Fe > Co > Ni [23]. Table 4 summarises the characteristics of these metals, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. A catalyst's specific reaction activity is determined by a parameter that concerns the catalyst surface's ability to create chemical bonds with either product, reaction intermediates, or reactants throughout the reaction. In that case, a volcanic curve is observed [50–53]. Bligaard et al. [54] identified certain metal catalysts' activity and linked them to chemisorption energy in metal surfaces, as shown in Fig. 7 . The volcano graphic illustrates that the dissociative CO adsorption energies of the metals on the extreme right were very high. The strong resistance to CO dissociation reduced the methanation rate, which was not deemed good for CO methanation. However, the metals at left had lower dissociative CO adsorption energies, and the high binding energy in adsorbed C and O species restricted the reaction rate. The metals in the center (e.g., Ru) had ideal chemisorption energy near −150 kJ mol−1. This may explain why Ru has a higher methanation activity than all 8–10 other group components; Rh, Ni, and Co also have an excellent methanation reaction activity."
4,Effect of supporting materials,"3.2 Effect of supporting materials Usually, support materials are indispensable for metal-based catalysts, which can play an essential role in catalytic properties by affecting metal dispersion, thermal stability, electronic and structural properties. Therefore, the study of different supporting materials is one of the most oriented research fields in CO methanation. There are some supporting materials commonly used in CO methanation, as shown in Fig. 8 . 3.2.1 Alumina (Al2O3) Al2O3 is the most used support for CO methanation reactions for its diverse crystalline structure, textural and chemical features. Al2O3 exhibits exceptional porosity, a high surface area, and unmatched stability, all of which are cited by researchers to justify its use as catalyst support, as it is the most often employed catalyst support in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. But there are always drawbacks to using Al2O3 as a support, such as the collapse of pore structure due to the phase transformation of Al2O3 during the reaction process at high temperature and the development of the Ni-Al spinel phase, which is hard to decrease. Al2O3 of different crystal forms can be synthesized by thermal dehydration of aluminum trihydroxide and aluminum oxyhydroxide at different temperatures [55,56]. Many efforts have been made to increase the stability of Al2O3-supported catalysts, including the addition of support promoters and the use of sophisticated catalyst manufacturing methods. The Ni-based catalysts supported by γ-Al2O3 were extensively studied in CO methanation since γ-Al2O3 has a large surface area and an advanced pores structure, and well-developed acidic property [56,57]. Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, however, still suffer from some disadvantages, such as carbon deposition, metal sintering, and γ-Al2O3 phase transformation at high temperatures, resulting in the collapse of the pore structure. Moreover, Ni-metal is inclined to form the NiAl2O4 spinel phase with Al2O3, which is difficult to reduce even at high temperatures, thus lowering the catalytic activity during the methanation reaction. Because of the inconvenience of γ-Al2O3, some studies turned γ-Al2O3 mesostructured to enhance its surface and textural properties [56,58]. For example, Olesen et al. [43] examined CO methanation on the catalyst Ni/Al2O3 and investigated the catalyst's deactivation for carbon formation. A linear association was found between the degree of catalytic deactivation and the amount of coke deposition. Although nucleation of carbon deposition may have begun at the Ni phase sites, subsequent growth occurred at Ni terraces' sites. Ma et al. [56] synthesized a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst of a coral-reef morphology for syngas methanation. They found a superior activity and high resistance to deactivation compared to conventional-based catalysts because of coral reef-like structure.Liet al. [57] synthesized a macro-mesoporous Ni/Al2O3 catalyst to execute CO methanation. In the macro-mesoporous framework, the very stable and small Ni nanoparticles were found to increase catalytic performance. Battulga et al. [59] used different supports such as SiO2, TiO2, nano-γ-Al2O3*, and γ-Al2O3 to perform CO methanation. They found that the Ni/γ-Al2O3* catalyst illustrated the highest amount of methane among other catalysts for finely distributed and smaller sizes of NiO particles in the γ-Al2O3*. In another work, Zhang et al., [60] conducted CO methanation over MoOx-doped (x < 3) ordered mesoporous Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by two different methods, including the impregnation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method. The optimal mesoporous Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst reaches the maximum CO conversion and CH4 yield of 97.9% and 93.8%, respectively, at 375C, 0.1 MPa, and a weight hourly space velocity of 60 000 mL g-1h−1. The superior catalytic performance was highly linked to the high specific surface area, small Ni particle size, and high metal dispersion. They reported that the Mo promoter is in the form of MoOx (x < 3) with the mixed-valence of Mo (IV) and Mo (VI), which can increase the density of Ni atomic electron clouds and reduce the Ni particle size. Several other studies were conducted over Al2O3 as supporting materials, and significant results were obtained [61–67]. 3.2.1.1 Silica (SiO2) Due to its high surface area, large pores, excellent chemical resistance, and controllable size, SiO2 has attracted considerable attention in recent years. SiO2 has been extensively studied for CO methanation as a supporting material for Ni-based catalysts [68–70]. Chen et al. [68] performed methanation of CO using a modified Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The small amount of silicone prevented the adsorption by carbon species via the intermetallic phase. They found excellent catalytic and substantial sintering resistance during CO methanation. Li et al. [69] used SiO2 supporting material to prepare a Ni-NiO/SiO2 catalyst for CO methanation. They showed that the Ni-NiO/SiO2 catalyst with highly dispersed Ni-NiO nanoparticles improved CO methanation efficiency with high thermal stability, as shown in Fig. 9 . They also concluded that adequate metal-support interaction also played an important role in increased CO methanation by reducing NiO to Ni at lower temperatures, as shown in Fig. 9e. Besides, highly dispersed Ni-NiO nanoparticles retarded coke deposition during CO methanation, as shown in Fig. 9f. Mesoporous silica is a recent discovery in nanotechnology, as MCM-41 is one of the most common forms of mesoporous silica. Due to its prestigious features, it has also attracted considerable interest in CO methanation. Zhang et al. [71] used MCM-41 as a nickel-metal support material to conduct CO methanation. They found that the strong interaction between the MCM-41 and the Ni species had improved catalytic activity, thermal stability, and anti-sintering capabilities of the Ni-MCM-41. Recently, SBA-15 has been studied as a supporting material in CO methanation for its thicker pore walls, high mechanical and hydrothermal stability than MCM-41. Tao et al. [72] carried out CO methanation to investigate the catalytic properties of SBA-15 supported Ni-based catalysts. They found a superior catalytic activity and thermal stability for the high nickel dispersion by improving the interaction between the silica surface and the nickel nanoparticles. Bian et al. [73] studied CO methanation on a modified SBA-16 by silylation. The Ni catalysts supported on SBA-16 (SBA-16-NH2) showed a strong interaction between SBA-16 and Ni's particles with improved Ni dispersion, resulting in superior selectivity of CH4 during the CO methanation reaction. 3.2.1.2 Zirconia (ZrO2) ZrO2 is considered a promising support material for CO methanation catalysts for its outstanding features, including high chemical inertness, thermal stability, and acidic/basic properties. There are three crystal forms for ZrO2, i.e., cubic (c-ZrO2), tetragonal (t-ZrO2), and monoclinic (m-ZrO2), as shown in Fig. 10 . The temperature has greatly affected the crystal forms for ZrO2. For example, m-ZrO2 reversibly transforms into t-ZrO2 and then to c-ZrO2 at around 1170 °C and 2370 °C, respectively [74–77]. In most cases, t-ZrO2 and c-ZrO2 are more suitable for industrial applications, as the mechanical property of m-ZrO2 is insufficient. However, the Ni/t-ZrO2 catalysts still experienced deactivation for CO methanation at elevated temperatures for transformation to m-ZrO2, resulting in a decrease in the surface area and dispersion of Ni on ZrO2 [78]. Various efforts have been made to overcome this problem by adding Yb, Si, Ce, Sm, or SiO2 as the structural stabilizer for CO methanation catalysts [79–82]. Huang et al. [79] modified the Ni-ZrO2 catalyst with Yb2O3 to execute the CO methanation reaction. It was unveiled that after the addition of Yb2O3, the Ni-ZrO2 catalyst displayed excellent activity with high thermal stability towards CO methanation for the formation of (Zr-Yb)Oyoxide with c-ZrO2 structure. Wang et al. [80] researched CO methanation and found that the phase transition of t-ZrO2 could be prevented during catalytic activity by adding SiO2, thus enhancing the CO methanation's stability catalyst. 3.2.1.3 Ceria (CeO2) CeO2 is a versatile rare earth oxide and has several applications in different fields, such as catalysis, nanomedicine, biomedical and fuel cells, for its exceptional characteristics, including oxygen storage ability. CeO2 can store and release oxygen for Ce4+ and Ce3+ redox couple, owing to a reversible reaction: ( CeO 2 ⇌ CeO 2 - x + x 2 O 2 ) . CeO2′s unusual property makes it attractive catalyst support for heterogeneous catalytic processes, and it is also referred to as a lattice defect promoter [83]. CeO2 can be used under reducing oxidizing and conditions for high thermal stability, better metal dispersion, and strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in CO methanation. Besides, CeO2 can minimize the coke formation and sintering impact to improve the methane selectivity and catalytic thermal stability by increasing the dispersion of active sites and crystallite size [84,85]. Nematollahi et al. [84] used CeO2 as a supporting material to execute CO methanation and reported superior catalytic performance for mesoporous structure with high surface area and crystallite size. Zyryanova et al. [86] prepared Ni/CeO2 catalyst for CO methanation and concluded that Ni/CeO2 revealed small nickel-containing particles, resulting in good catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Zhang et al. [87] used CeO2 as supporting material to prepare Ni/CeO2 catalysts for CO methanation. The catalyst exhibited a superior low-temperature activity for the high dispersion of Ni particles and enhanced metal-support interaction. Ding et al. [88] prepared an Al2O3-CeO2 supported Ni catalyst to perform bio-syngas methanation towards synthetic natural gas. They reported that the addition of CeO2 in Al2O3 promoted Ni dispersion, which improved catalytic activity with resistance to carbon deposition of the Ni/Al2O3-CeO2. Razzaq et al. [89] prepared a composite by mixing CeO2 with ZrO2 for CO methanation. They found that the ZrO2-CeO2-supported catalyst revealed high catalytic performance with anti-coking and anti-sintering characteristics for higher metal-support interaction, improved crystalline structure, and metal reduction. Adding CeO2 to ZrO2 produced oxygen vacancies with a reduced valence ratio of Ce4+/Ce3+, resulting in enhanced CO adsorption on the ZrO2-CeO2-supported catalyst. 3.2.2 Titania (TiO2) TiO2 is a typical semiconductor material, has been used as support in many heterogeneous catalysis processes with photocatalysis as a representative [90,91]. The beneficial effect of TiO2 on CO methanation activity has been reported, which is attributed to its strong interaction with the metal and enhancement of the chemisorption of H2 and CO [92]. Yin et al. [93] used TiO2 as a supporting material to synthesize a Ni-TiO2 catalyst to study CO methanation. They reported high catalytic activity and thermal stability towards CO methanation for Ni increased dispersion and the formation of more active sites on the Ni/TiO2 catalyst. Abdel-Mageed et al. [94] investigated CO methanation using TiO2 as a supporting material to synthesize Ru/TiO2 catalysts. The catalyst efficiency was considerably increased for the increased surface area, Ru particles' distribution, and interactions between Ru and TiO2. Lin et al. [95] study CO methanation by introducing UV irradiation over Ni/TiO2 catalyst. UV light radiation was reported to generate the photoelectrons flying from TiO2 to Ni, resulting in increased CO methanation activity by the adsorption and high CO activation count. Fig. 11 describes the process as mentioned earlier of CO methanation by UV irradiation over Ni/TiO2. This study shows that the photo-generated electrons caused by TiO2′s band-gap excitation can be used as electron donors to facilitate thermal catalytic hydrogenation of CO to CH4 over the TiO2 assisted noble-metal-free Ni/TiO2 catalyst. Previously, several other CO methanation studies were conducted using TiO2 [96–100]. 3.2.3 Zeolites Zeolites, which are defined as microporous crystalline aluminosilicates, are essential catalysts or supports in many industrial processes [101]. Their extraordinary catalytic performance is originated from the adjustable acidic properties, crystalline frameworks, and regular topological channel structures [102]. Nevertheless, conventional zeolites with relatively small and solely micropores impose a severe limitation on diffusion in many catalytic processes, leading to coke formation in micropores and fast catalyst deactivation. Hence, it is beneficial to prepare mesoporous zeolites possessing micro-mesoporosity [103,104]. Teh et al. [104] found that the Ni-promoted mesoporous ZSM-5 (Ni/mZSM-5) catalyst showed superior catalytic performance during the CO methanation reaction. There was a strong correlation between the micro-mesoporosity and the basicity of the mZSM-5 towards enhanced CO methanation. In another study, Cao et al. [105] studied CO methanation using a modified 3D-mesoporous KIT-6zeolite with Ni and V. The 20Ni-2 V/KIT-6 catalyst displayed excellent performance because of electron transfers from V to Ni0 species. Saha et al. [106] investigated a sequence of Pd catalysts assisted by H-ZSM5, Na-ZSM5, H-Y, Na-Y zeolites, and SiO2 for CO hydrogenation. Different supporting materials' methanation activity was noticed in the following order of SiO2 < Na-Y < Na-ZSM5 < H-ZSM5 < H-Y. They concluded that the acidity greatly affected the catalytic activity between the reaction of CO and H2. Eckle et al. [107] executed CO methanation using two types of supporting materials, including zeolite and Al2O3. It was found that the zeolite-supported catalyst (Ru/zeolite) exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to Al2O3 supported catalyst (Ru/Al2O3) for different chemical properties such as higher acidity different morphology of the zeolite. Compared to the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, very small Ru particles in the Ru/zeolite catalyst could affect the catalytic activity during CO methanation. The surface chemistry changes affected catalytic performance by enhancing the contact time between active sites and reactants. To demonstrate the possibility of translating the gas-phase CO methanation reaction, Mravak et al. [108] examined CO methanation over Ru-promoted ZSM-5 zeolite and used density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The CO ligand environment in protecting the Ru4 + metal core enhanced adsorption and dissociation of H2 during CO methanation. 3.2.3.1 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted considerable interest in the catalysis field since Iijima first reported it. Among the different types of supports, carbon materials, including activated carbon (AC) graphite, pyrolytic carbon, glassy carbon, carbon black (CB) polymer-derived carbon, have been well used in heterogeneous catalysis for their specific characteristics [109]. Truszkiewicz et al. [110] studied CO methanation using graphitized carbons as supporting material. It was found that the CO methanation activity over Ru/C systems was highly dependent on the crystallite size and surface chemistry of its crystallites. Ahmad et al. [111] carried out CO methanation over mesoporous thin sheets of carbon graphite and showed that the bulk mpg-C3N4 mesopores and scratches were formed air condition. They found that mpg-C3N4 thin sheets increased the number of active catalyst sites, leading to excellent catalytic performance against CO methanation. Among many other supports, carbon materials have been examined as supports for CO methanation, and significant results were reported [112–115]. 3.2.4 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are made of metal ions, clusters, and bridging organic linkers, have emerged as a promising new class of porous materials. MOFs have attracted promising interest since Yaghi first described them in the late 1990s [116,117]. MOFs materials incorporate the advantages of organic and inorganic components and show characteristics that surpass their constituents' sum. Besides, MOFs have some unique features and advantages compared to conventional materials, including exceptionally large specific surface areas, ultra-high porosity, and various structures, adjustable framework structure, hybrid composition, specified and diverse crystal structures, particularly confined microenvironment, etc., allowing their outstanding performance in different applications as catalysts [118–123]. Very recently, inspired by the MOFs structure's unique features, Ping et al. [123] have prepared a highly efficient MOFs-tempered Ni catalyst for CO methanation. High catalytic activity and stability were found during the long-term durability test for the small size and the high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles. Wezendonk et al. [124] prepared a Fe-based MOFs catalyst for CO hydrogenation. They noticed a high catalytic performance, which correlated to the Fe particle size and corresponding surface area of the catalyst. Ning et al. [125] performed CO hydrogenation over carbon-supported cobalt MOFs catalysts and found a high selectivity with high catalytic stability. 3.2.5 Fibrous materials Recently a new material, KAUST Catalysis Center-1 (KCC-1), with unique emerging morphology initiated by Polshettiwar et al. [126]. The fibrous structure of KCC-1 mainly contains dendrimeric fibers composed entirely of silica, resulting in a high surface dispersion when accessing the active site for their small size and the large surface-to-volume ratio [127–129]. Based on the unique fibrous morphology of KCC-1, Teh et al. [130] synthesized a fibrous silica catalyst ZSM-5 and used it for the CO methanation reaction. Unique fibrous morphology of fibrous silica ZSM-5 catalyst was noticed, resulting in excellent catalytic activity for high basicity, oxygen vacancies, and interparticle porosity. Fatah et al. [131] also reported that the cobalt (Co) loaded KCC-1 showed high catalytic performance towards CO methanation because of better metal dispersion and high basicity. Hussain et al. [7] prepared a fibrous silica mordenite catalyst (FSMOR) using commercial mordenite through the microemulsion method, as shown in Fig. 12 . They applied the FSMOR catalyst for CO methanation as a metal-free catalyst. They found that the surface area, pores volume, oxygen vacancies, and basicity enhanced the catalytic performance of the FSMOR catalyst towards CO methanation. In situ spectroscopic analysis of ESR and FTIR showed that methane was formed at oxygen vacancies, which acted as active sites during CO methanation. Linearly adsorbed CO* was an important intermediate, converted into C* to form CH4 by hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 13 . Hussain et al. [24,132] found high catalytic efficiency of metal-free fibrous silica ZSM-5 and fibrous silica beta in other CO methanation studies zeolite catalysts for their fibrous morphology, enhancing surface area, pores diameter, basicity, and oxygen vacancies. 3.2.6 Composite oxide supports As a result of their superior benefits, such as the presence of abundant oxygen vacancies and great thermal stability, different supporting materials are utilized in the design of catalysts to improve the catalytic performance of CO methanation. Wang et al. [133] conducted CO methanation using a synthesized Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Adding ZrO2 to Ni/SiO2 catalyst significantly improved catalytic efficiency by generating a Si-O-Zr bond and increased acid strength by supporting ZrO2-SiO2. The existence of ZrO2 greatly enhanced the interaction of NiOs with ZrO2-SiO2, resulting in a high degree of dispersion and reduction of NiOs. Therefore, the Ni/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst has a smaller Ni crystallite size, higher Ni dispersion, more active Ni species, and greater H2 adsorption ability, leading to its higher catalytic activity of CO methanation. Wu et al. [134] investigated the effect of the ZrO2 promoter on the catalytic activity of Ni/SiO2 against CO methanation. The findings were that the addition of the ZrO2 promoter increased catalytic activity because the Ni/ZrO2-SiO2 catalyst enhanced the ability to adsorb CO. It was concluded that the bridged carbonyl hydrides were responsible for high catalytic activity for CO methanation. Liu et al. [135] used ZrO2 as a promoter to enhance Ni/Al2O3 catalysts' catalytic performance for CO methanation. The selective deposition of ZrO2 nanoparticles on the NiO surface rather than Al2O3 could regulate the modification of electrostatic interactions, resulting in high catalytic performance. Coke formation has been understood to be a product of the balance between coke or carbon formation and gasification; gasification on the region of the Ni is typically less than coke formation. ZrO2 can activate CO2 molecules at the Ni/ZrO2 interface, thereby dissociating CO2 from the intermediate CO and oxygen formation. As a result, the catalyst's coke resistance was caused by the improved ZrO2 dissociation of CO2 that produces intermediate oxygen that could promote removing the carbon produced on Ni Particles shown in Fig. 14 . To facilitate the removal of Ni particle carbon, ZrO2 might be distributed more efficiently on the NiO surface than Al2O3. If no promoter is present, the carbon species can elevate or encapsulate the Ni particles under severe conditions for carbon deposition and low interaction between Ni and support. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst's coking resistance was thus enhanced for the selective deposition of ZrO2 over the catalyst on the NiO surface. CeO2 materials have come under intense scrutiny as catalysts and as structural and electronic promoters for different supported metal catalysts. It has the merits of inhibiting coke formation by changing CeO2 and Ce2O3 under oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively, improving thermal stability, promoting the metal dispersion, and changing the metals' electronic properties through strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) [136,137]. Atzori et al. [138] executed CO and CO2 methanation over a modified Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. Almost complete conversion of CO was achieved for the beneficial effect of Ce, which could be correlated with NiO reducibility and ability to absorb and activate CO2. Wang et al. [139] modified a Ni/SiO2 catalyst with CeO2 for CO methanation. They found superior catalytic performance for the addition of Ce promoter, which generated an interaction among NiO, CeO2, and SiO2 to change the Ni-O-Si bond's chemical environment for enhanced dispersion reduction of NiO and increased the active surface area. Ding et al. [140] conducted bio-syngasmethanation over the CeO2 modified Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. They recorded excellent bio-syngas methanation efficiency by adding CeO2 to the Ni / CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst. They concluded that adding CeO2 into Ni/Al2O3 strengthened the NiO-CeO2 interaction via the weakening of Ni species and Al2O3, facilitating the separation of NiO from NiAl2O4. Liu et al. [141] studied Ce-promoted Ni/SiC catalyst towards high-temperature CO methanation. After adding Ce, the catalytic activity and thermal stability were improved for enhanced interaction between Ni and SiC and improved dispersion of Ni active species. Adding Ce significantly improved anti-cocking ability of the 7Ce-10Ni/SiC catalyst, as shown in temperature-programmed oxidation, thermal gravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopic observations (Fig. 15 ). They concluded that the highly dispersed CeO2 inhibited carbon's graphitization so that the surface carbon could be alleviated graphitization, reducing the formation of surface-inactive graphitized carbon. Yang et al. [142] modified Ni/SiO2 catalyst with CeO2 to conduct a methanation reaction. It was found that the CeO2 promoter, after being modified by impregnation, was able to lower Ni particle size and boost H2 and CO absorption. A Ni-phyllosilicate catalyst (NPS-180-5C) modified with CeO2 proved to be the most effective catalyst in this study, as it was able to attain the thermodynamic equilibrium of CO methanation above 350 °C and had high catalytic activity. They concluded that using CeO2 to modify SR-derived Ni-phyllosilicate increased its methanation capabilities by reducing the sintering of Ni-phyllosilicate and boosting the strength of catalytic activity as well hydrothermal stability of the material. Several authors have reported the beneficial effect of TiO2 as a support promoter to enhance Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO methanation. TiO2-Al2O3 composite can retain the benefits of both TiO2 and Al2O3, and increase the amount of weak and strong acid centers because of the presence of titanium cations in an electron-deficient environment [143]. The addition of TiO2 could also effectively inhibit the formation of hardly reducible spinel-like species and increase the dispersion of the Ni metallic phase [144]. Waldvogel synthesized Ni/CeZrPr mixed oxide for methanation in Power-to-Gas with Co-electrolysis. They concluded that the properties of the support and its interaction with the metallic active phase, usually Ni, are critical parameters controlling methanation processes and can be modified by the support's synthesis. A combination of different features, including high mesoporosity and surface area, which allowed for good Ni dispersion, high support metal interaction, and reducibility, resulted in the best performances when subjected to CO2/CO methanation [145]."
5,Effects of preparation method,"3.3 Effects of preparation method One of the most important factors in the design of heterogeneous catalysts is the selection of an appropriate and effective technique. Changing the amount of metal dispersions, crystal structure, and the amount of metal that may be put into support can influence catalytic activity through the association of chemical and physical processes [146,147]. Fig. 16 shows different preparation techniques used in CO methanation, and their brief comparison is summarized in Table 5 . Truszkiewicz et al. [110] conducted CO methanation analysis over Ru/C catalysts, prepared by wet impregnation and dry- impregnation methods. It was found that the wet impregnation-prepared Ru/C catalyst exhibited superior catalytic CO methanation activity for the homogeneous distribution of Ru crystallites in carbon samples, which acted as an active phase during the catalytic performance. Liu et al. [135] prepared modified ZrO2-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO methanation using different preparation methods. The catalysts prepared through impregnation and deposition–precipitation methods showed a superior catalytic activity towards CO methanation. The electrostatic interaction created by selective deposition of ZrO2 on the NiO surface improved catalytic activity during CO methanation. In another study, Tao et al. [150] prepared nickel-based SBA-15 catalysts for CO methanation using a surfactant-assisted impregnation method. The high catalytic efficiency of ordered mesoporous SBA-15 channels was observed for Ni's uniform distribution, as shown in Fig. 17 B. They demonstrated a superior catalytic activity and high thermal stability against CO methanation for moderate interaction between support and nickel and highly confined nickel dispersion on support. The addition of surfactant hindered the migration and aggregation of metal ions during CO methanation's catalytic performance. Gao et al. [151] synthesized Ni-promoted barium hexaaluminate (Ni/BHA) by coprecipitation impregnation methods. It was disclosed that the Ni/BHA catalysts displayed excellent catalytic efficiency CO methanation with high thermal stability and anti-coking capability. The Ni/BHA catalyst was found to have superior performance for nonacidic design, mild metal support interaction between Ni particles, and BHA support. Rombi et al. [152] used a hard-templated method to synthesize a Ni-Ce mixed oxides catalyst for CO methanation. Catalytic performance was shown to be substantially correlated with small NiO particle size. The Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 soft-templated CO methanation catalysts were prepared by Atzori et al. [153]. The beneficial effects of the Ce material, which could be linked with increased NiO reducibility and greater ability to absorb and activate CO/CO2, have nearly completed the CO conversion. Wang et al. [154] studied CO methanation over catalyst prepared by hydrothermal technique. They found the excellent catalytic performance of the flower-like MoS2 catalyst. The multi-layered MoS2 and slowed crystallite size growth during the reaction improved catalytic efficiency and stability by forming the microstructures of MoS2. Through a hydrothermal synthesis process, Zhenpu et al. [155] synthesized a molybdenum disulfide-alumina/nickel-foam catalyst (MoS2-Al2O3/Ni-Foam) for CO methanation. The high amount of Mo4+ (MoS2) active species and the high heat transfer efficiency of the MoS2-Al2O3/Ni-Foam catalyst, resulting in improved reactivity and sulfur-tolerant performance for CO methanation. Yan et al. [34] investigated the catalyst preparation methodologies' effect towards CO methanation over Ni/SiO2. A dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma decomposition and thermal decomposition methods were compared towards catalytic efficiency and thermal stability of catalysts, as shown in Fig. 18 . Strong interaction between SiO2 and Ni and high metal dispersion have been developed by the plasma decomposition process, resulting in superior catalytic efficiency. The plasma-produced catalyst also effectively inhibited the coke formation and Ni sintering, as shown in Fig. 18 (d). In another study, Zhao et al. [156] prepared a Ni/SiO2 CO methanation catalyst using dielectric-barrier discharge and ammonia impregnation methods. They found a high catalytic activity for high dispersion and small Ni particles with more Ni (111) facets, strong metal-support interaction, which leads to anti-sintering with the improved activity of Ni/SiO2 by suppressing the mobility of Ni particles. There have been many studies that have used plasma treatments to synthesize efficient catalysts for CO methanation [157–161]. Gao et al. [162] used the microwave-assisted solution combustion method to prepare a nano NiAl-U catalyst for CO methanation. It was revealed that the NiAl-U catalyst illustrated excellent catalytic performance than other commercial catalysts. Besides, a major improvement in the anti-sintering capability and thermal stability of the NiAl-U catalyst was noted for the high disparity of support Ni active species and smaller Ni particle sizes. Li et al. [163] executed CO methanation over Ni-based multi-layered vermiculite (Ni/VMT) catalyst prepared by microwave irradiation-assisted method. The mechanism of formation of the Ni/VMT catalyst is shown schematically in Fig. 19 A. This involves three primary stages: (1) extended multilayer VMT synthesis, (2) preparing precursors for Ni/VMT, and (3) thermal treatment. First, expanded multi-layered VMT was synthesized and dried using a microwave irradiation-assisted technique through exposure to an H2O2 aqueous solution. Secondly, the Ni(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution, equivalent-volume impregnation employed to form the precursor of Ni/VMT. Third, when the precursor was heated, NiO nanoparticles on the VMT were formed. Microwave-assisted irradiation composite NiO/VMT demonstrated excellent catalytic efficiency for highly scattered support active sites (Fig. 19B). When heat treatment was performed on the precursor, in contrast to CHT, MIAS can provide quick heating, effectively preventing NiO nanoparticles' growth and aggregation. In another study, the microwave-assisted method was used to prepare the CO methanation catalyst [164]. One of the most flexible methods for preparing heterogeneous catalysts in various reactions is the sol–gel method. A sol–gel process carries out the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts by locking homogeneous metal precursors into the titanium matrix of silica [165]. Sol-gel methods have many promising benefits over precipitation methods. In this preparation method, a porous solid substance is formed by a colloidal route from small molecules of metal alkoxides, nitrides, and sulfides [166,167]. Lakshmanan et al. [168] used a sol–gel method to prepare a Ni@SiO2 core–shell catalyst. The Ni@SiO2 catalyst show high stabilized smaller Ni nanoparticles and nanorods with unique core–shell morphology, as shown in Fig. 20 . The Ni@SiO2 catalyst with silica core–shell prevented agglomeration successfully compared to the traditional Ni/SiO2 catalyst. As a result, the Ni@SiO2 catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity and anti-sintering ability. Jalali et al. [169] also the sol–gel process to prepare mixed oxides of different Fe and Al contents for CO methanation. It was found that the Ni/Fe-Al catalyst illustrated a superior activity for the high reducibility and high specific surface area of Ni. Several other studies used the sol–gel method to synthesize the CO methanation catalysts, and promising results were obtained [170–174]. Schulman first described the term microemulsion in 1959 [175]. Since then, as reported by Chhabra et al. in their 1997 review article, microemulsions have developed a wide range of applications, from oil recovery to nanoparticle synthesis. A reliable method for regulating the morphology, geometry, particle size modulation, homogeneity, and surface area of the target product [176,177] is microemulsion. A new fibrous material, KCC-1 has recently been synthesized by the microemulsion process. The surface area and mesoporosity were increased remarkably for the unique morphology of KCC-1. The fibrous structure of KCC-1 mainly contains dendrimeric fiber fully composed of silica [126,176]. Teh et al. [130] used the microemulsion method to synthesize a fibrous silica ZSM-5 for CO methanation. The unique fibrous morphology enhanced the catalytic efficiency in CO methanation. The microemulsion method was used in several studies to prepare CO methanation catalysts with outstanding catalytic performance [7,24,32,132]."
6,Effect of additives or promoters,"3.4 Effect of additives or promoters The promoters and/or additives that boost the catalyst resistance to sintering or coking are promising concepts to improve the catalyst operation and thermal stability during chemical reactions. As illustrated in Fig. 21 , the promoters can be divided into three categories: chemical (electronic), textural (structural), and lattice defect promoters. Chemical promoters are used to supply additional new active sites to catalysts to increase the chemical properties of catalysts that are connected to their basicity or redox property, respectively. Textural promoters are mostly used to delay or prevent the sintering of active species by increasing the texture characteristics of the catalysts used. In the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysis, lattice defect promoters are used to increase the number of lattice defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) in the supporting material to improve the performance of surface oxygen adsorption and the migrating ability of lattice oxygen molecules. According to literature, CO methanation processes are facilitated by the employment of a variety of promoters, including alkali metals (such as Li, Na, K, and Ce), alkaline earth metal oxides (La2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2, e.g.), and transition metals [146,178,179]. 3.4.1 Alkali metals To boost catalytic efficiency and thermal stability, several CO methanation catalysts are promoted by adding alkaline cations. Alkali metals have been used as catalytic modifiers for many important industrial catalytic processes for many years. The most appealing theory is, by far, that alkaline metal atoms directly or through help change the local electron density of the transition metal [180]. The CO methanation catalyst Ni-Al2O3 was synthesized by Gao et al. [181] with different metal chlorides, i.e., CaCl2, MgCl2, KCl, LiCl, NaCl2, and KCl. It was found that all the added metal chlorides can absorb the heat of reaction during combustion, and the addition of NaCl lowers the combustion temperature for its high heat power. However, opposite results were reported by Le et al. [182]. The addition of Na decreased the Na/Ni/SiO2 and Na/Ni/CeO2 surface region, resulting in a reduction in CO methanation activity for Ni metal surface blockage. Conversely, Na had a beneficial influence on the methanation of CO2 over the catalysts of Na/Ni/SiO2. Na's different effects on CO2 methanation are closely related to the quantity of CO2 chemisorbed on the catalysts. Dai et al. [183] studied CO methanation over Rh/A12O3 and Rh/TiO2 catalytic films. They found that the potassium's presence decreased the common gem dicarbonyls and linear COs on supported rhodium compared with non-potassium catalysts. On the other hand, the presence of potassium has greatly improved the bridged carbonyl species. The potassium-added Rh/TiO2 films catalyzed substantial amounts of acetone and acetaldehyde for oxygenated product production. The precursor for oxygenated products was possibly the bridged carbonyl species. Similar studies related to CO methanation have previously been investigated [180,184–186]. 3.4.2 Addition of alkaline earth metals Alkaline earth metals, which are considered structural promoters, are commonly used to improve the metal-support interactions, the dispersion of metal particles, and to prevent aggregation of active species in CO methanation catalysts [187]. Barrientos et al. [188] investigated the effect of Zr, Mg, Ba, and Ca oxide promoters in Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. They concluded that none of these promoters seemed to impact the catalyst's thermal resistance positively. The presence of Zr, however, could reduce the polymer carbon formation rate. Han et al. [189] investigated the CO methanation reaction over Mg-modified nickel-loaded tungsten oxide (Mg-Ni/WO3). The Ni particle size and electron density were reduced by Mg, which resulted in high catalytic activity and thermal intensity compared to Ni/WO3, as shown in Fig. 22 a. A reasonable amount of MgO substantially increased the capacity to adsorb hydrogen, ultimately improving the catalytic efficiency shown in Fig. 22b. 3.4.3 Addition of La2O3 La2O3 is an essential rare earth oxide that is extensively employed in catalysis because of its peculiar electrical properties and thermal stability. It is referred to as a structural promoter or a “spacer” because of its propensity to encourage structure growth. La2O3 is also used as a promoter for CO methanation catalysts to boost catalytic activity by providing high surface basicity and enhancing metal-support interaction. La2O3 can also suppress carbon deposition and improve catalyst thermal stability. In several studies, the addition of La2O3 effectively increased active species' dispersion and prevented NiO nanoparticles' growth on supporting materials [190,62,191–193]. Si et al. [194] used La2O3 as a catalyst promoter and found that the Ni/La2O3-ZrO2-catalyst had vigorous CO methanation activity because of the enhanced dispersion of Ni. This catalyst also displayed excellent stability for significant improvements in anti-coking and anti-sintering properties. 3.4.4 Addition of vanadium oxide (VOx) VOx is a strong promoter for CO and CO2 methanation catalysts [195]. Liu et al. [196] found that adding VOx as a promoter could increase Ni cloud electron density, strengthen the Ni-C bond in the Ni-C-O complex and weaken the C-O bond, resulting in a simple dissociation of the C-O bond. Tian et al. [195] investigated VOx's role in catalytic efficiency of Ni/MCF catalysts for CO methanation. They concluded that excellent catalytic efficiency and thermal stability were correlated with the VOx promoter in Ni/MCF. VOx's addition could increase Ni nanoparticles' dispersion and improve Ni's electron density, thereby increasing C-O bond disintegration. Liu et al. [196] used V2O3 as the promoter for CO methanation in the Ni-V2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The addition of V2O3 produced Ni3V2O8, which facilitated smaller Ni particles, as shown in Fig. 23 a. The reduction of Ni3V2O8 makes the formation of smaller particle size Ni simpler compared to pure NiO, resulting in large H2 absorptions and higher Ni dispersion. V2O3 facilitated CO dissociation by using the oxidation–reduction cycle, and the oxygen vacancy acted as the active site for CO2 activation to remove the carbon on the Ni particles (Fig. 23b). In another study, Tian et al. [197] examined CO methanation over the VOx promoter-based Ni-VOx/FDU‐12 catalyst. They reported that the addition of vanadium promoter to Ni/FDU‐12 catalyst had improved Ni dispersion and changed electron density of Ni, resulting in the enhanced catalytic performance at low temperature. Lu et al. [198] prepared VOx-added Ni catalysts supported on modified bentonite (B) and applied them for CO methanation. The VOx-free catalyst (Fig. 23A) showed the distribution un-homogeneously for Ni particles' aggregation during catalyst preparation. On the other hand, the Ni particles are more homogeneously distributed to VOx-promoted catalysts, resulting in a decrease in Ni particles' size (Fig. 23C) because of the electronic impact of the VOx promoter in the catalysts. Cao et al. [199] stated that V modified Ni-KIT-6 zeolite significantly promoted catalytic efficiency at low temperatures for a stronger transfer of electrons from V to Ni0. Similarly, other CO methanation studies using VOx prompter enhanced considerably catalytic activity and thermal stability [200–202]. Recently, Le et al. [203] prepared metals promoted M−Ni/Al@Al2O3 (M = Ce, Mn, Mg, Zr, Zn, V, or K) catalysts for the CO/CO2 methanation reaction. It was found that the Ni-V/Al@Al2O3 catalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance for the improvement of the Ni dispersion, as shown in Fig. 24 . Li et al. [204] conducted CO methanation with promoter effect of V, Ce, and Zr over Ni/SBA-15 catalysts. TheV-promotedNi/SBA-15showedthebestcatalyticefficiencyfortheoxidation–reduction of the shift cycle (Mx+ at My+, M = Ce, V) that could cause electron transfer to increase the electron density of activated Ni species. 3.4.5 Addition of transition metals Metals like Fe, Mn, Co, Fe, Ce, and Zr are used to improve active metal dispersion and catalytic efficiency during methanation [203,205]. Zhao et al. [206] prepared Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for syngas methanation and investigated the Mn promoter's effect on catalytic performance. It was demonstrated that the addition of Mn to Ni/Al2O3 catalysts could increase the catalyst surface area and average pore volume, leading to higher activity and stability. In another study, Zhou et al. [207] elucidated Mn and Mg dual promoters' effect on modified Ni/α-Al2O3 catalysts for high-temperature syngas methanation. Mn and Mg species have been shown to contribute to a moderate interaction between NiOs and support that inhibited Ni agglomeration, improved Ni dispersion, and enhanced CO/CO2 adsorption capability. Meanwhile, the nickel electron cloud's density increases by transferring electrons from the catalysts, resulting in the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst's surfaces. Several transition metals were used to enhance the catalytic performance for CO methanation [208–211]. Table 6 summarizes the catalytic systems currently used in CO methanation and the corresponding catalytic results in recent studies. To extend the lifetime of Ni/lignite char catalyst, the Ni–Ce/lignite char catalyst was constructed using a range of Ni/Ce ratios (1–100) and evaluated for activity and stability during corncob tar reforming, respectively [235]. The Ni–Ce/lignite char with a Ni/Ce ratio of 50 was discovered to have a steady gas yield (69.1 vol%), which is higher than commercial Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Bian et al. [48] synthesized a series of catalysts for CO methanation, including Ni/SBA-16 and NiMo/SBA-16 catalysts. Mo-promoted catalysts showed a higher metal surface area and increased heat resistance, which was attributed to the establishment of a strong contact between Ni and SBA-16 in the catalysts. Mo–Ni/SBA-16 achieved the best activity (100% CO conversion, 97% CH4 selectivity). Zhi et al. further revealed the detailed mechanism of CO methanation on S@Ni (211) by examining the influence of Mo doping on the optimum pathway and S coverage. They studied the S inhibitor's effects in Ni (211) with 2S@Ni (211), as well as how Mo, the promoter in S@Mo/Ni (211), contributes to CO methanation [236]. Another study used the hydrothermal synthesis approach to construct a Ni-Mo-SiO2 catalyst that was used to perform the methanation reaction with syngas. It was discovered that the use of Mo resulted in higher catalytic performance during the methanation reaction [237]. To explore the effect of Sm2O3 as a promoter on the catalytic performance of ordered mesoporous NiO–Sm2O3–Al2O3 catalysts, Liu et al., used a simple one-pot evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method to produce synthetic natural gas via CO methanation [238]. Improved reducibility of Ni particles and smaller Ni particle sizes could result from the inclusion of the Sm species, which could result in even greater catalytic activity. Sm3+ (Sm2O3) was shown to be the predominant Sm species present on the reduced catalysts, resulting in superior catalytic performance over the reduced catalysts. Wang et al. demonstrated a considerable increase in the coke resistance of a Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst during methanation with the addition of Au. The increased coke resistance of Au–Ni/MgAl2O4 is thought to be related to the suppression of CO disproportionation caused by replacing Ni with Au [239]."
7,CO methanation's main challenges,
8,Deactivation of the catalysts,"4.1 Deactivation of the catalysts It is possible to deactivate methanation catalysts very quickly and severely as a result of a variety of physicochemical processes, such as oxidation of the metallic phase, thermal degradation of the support material, metal sintering, and in particular, the generation of coke, which can occur at high temperatures. Catalyst deactivation can be grouped into two broad categories (Table 7 ): (i) chemical deactivation and (ii) physical deactivation. Physical deactivation of the catalyst is primarily caused by attrition, thermal degradation (sintering), and fouling (coke deposition). While poisoning and vapor–solid reaction are responsible for chemical deactivation. The deactivation of catalysts is dependent on their structure and composition, as well as working parameters such as feed ratio, temperature, and pressure [240,241]. It is known as fouling when a physical deposition of gas-phase species occurs on the active surface of a catalyst, and it is responsible for the obstruction of the pores and active sites of the catalyst. For example, the Boudouard reaction or CO disproportionation can result in the formation of solid carbon: 2CO (g) ⇌ CO2 (g) + C (s). Since solid carbon can react with water and hydrogen to limit carbon deposition, this problem can be handled by utilizing a high H2/CO ratio or introducing steam during the methanation reaction [13,24,242]. The form of the catalyst particle and the operating parameters are the most important factors in this type of deactivation process. It usually happens when feedstock passes through methanation reactors like fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, or slurry-bed reactors, and it involves the carryover of dust and particles formed during attrition. Process conditions and catalyst structural features that are optimized with the least amount of attrition can be used to tackle this problem. In addition, DuPont has created a new technology that might enclose the active phase in a porous silica shell to allow unrestricted flow of the reactants and products without impacting selectivity or conversion, and this could be used in a variety of applications [242]. Another mechanism of catalyst deactivation is the sintering of metal particles as a result of increasing the size of the metal crystallites or the surface metal particles. This mechanism can cause catalysts to lose their active surface area, resulting in lower activity per gram of catalyst. The high temperature (over 500 °C) and exothermic nature of the methanation reaction may be possible contributing factors to the sintering effect. As a result, several catalysts have been optimized for methanation at elevated temperatures ((700 °C)) [246,247]. As mentioned above, the poisoning of Ni-based catalysts is a significant factor in the deactivation of these catalysts. This is because Ni metal is extremely reactive to both impurities that are intrinsically present in the CO stream, such as biogas and flue gas, as well as pollutants that are present in the surrounding environment. During methanation reactions, contaminants such as tars, Sulphur compounds, chlorine compounds, alkalis, ammonia, or particulates can react strongly with the active sites of the methanation catalysts. This problem is addressed by taking extra precautions while running or planning CO methanation plants that employ sulfur-containing CO generated from anaerobic biogas plants, coal, or biomass because of the Sulphur gradient that forms along the reactor axis is easily detected and mitigated [245]. It is necessary to build a proper Sulphur elimination system in the CO methanation reactors to avoid Sulphur poisoning. If the Sulphur content in the feedstock is in parts per billion (ppb), the state-of-the-art Ni-supported catalysts can maintain stability and activity for hundreds of hours [246]. It has been demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can react fast with nickel oxide (NiO) to create water and nickel sulfide (NiS), causing a decrease in the activity of Ni-based catalysts during the chemical reaction [247]. Catalyst deactivation is also caused by a variety of chemical reactions, including vapor phase reactions that can react with the catalyst's surface to form inactive surface species. A good example of this is when carbon monoxide (CO) combines with nickel (Ni) at low temperatures (below 230°Celsius) to produce the nickel tetracarbonyl complex (Ni (CO)4 (g)). It is recommended that the methanation process not be carried out over commercial Ni-based catalysts at temperatures lower than 250 °C in order to alleviate this issue [248,249]."
9,Reaction mechanism of CO methanation,"4.2 Reaction mechanism of CO methanation The reaction mechanism is the elucidation of the elementary steps of a chemical reaction. Specifically, it is essential to resolve three obstacles: (1) what kind of intermediates are? (2) what are the elementary steps that lead to the intermediates, in particular the rate-determining steps? (3) what are those sites that are active? To know what happens during the chemical reaction and to further guide the design of the catalyst, in situ observation with various spectroscopy techniques is followed by computational modeling of the elementary steps [250,251]. To achieve the desired catalyst's properties, the reaction mechanism of CO methanation is useful in terms of high efficiency, selectivity, and stability. However, obtaining full knowledge of the reaction mechanism is difficult because of the CO methanation reaction's complexities. Researchers agree that C-O's dissociation is a rate-limiting step, and the mechanism for CO methanation is like CO2 methanation. However, it is unknown whether C-O's bond cleavage follows a hydrogen-assisted mechanism or a direct dissociation of adsorbed CO without a hydrogen-assisted mechanism. The mechanisms for CO methanation can be classified into two types: (1) associative methanation and (2) dissociative methanation, as shown in Fig. 25 [7,130,252]. 4.2.1 CO associative methanation Several studies reported that direct bond breaking in C-O was not favorable kinetically without hydrogen. Therefore, C-O bond breaking happens via either carbon-hydroxyl (COHad) or formyl (CHOad) [253]. Several researchers advocated that the C-O bonds' dissociation was assisted by hydrogen. Fisher et al. [254] investigated the reaction mechanism for CO and CO2 hydrogenation using the Rh/SiO2 catalyst. They suggested that H2CO* dissociation, created by the stepwise hydrogenation of adsorbed CO, is the rate-determining step in methane formation. Van et al. [255] also reported similar findings during the CO methanation reaction mechanism. Vannice et al. [256] elucidated mechanistic studies of CO methanation on different Group VIII metals. During the CO methanation reaction, a clear kinetic isotopic effect was detected, confirming the involvement of H atoms in the rate-determining step, and the partially hydrogenated CO species were dissociated [257]. These results are based on the H-assisted mechanism of dissociation suggested in other works [258,259]. Eckle et al. [260] investigated mechanistic analysis of the methanation reaction of CO over the Ru-based catalyst. The CO associative methanation route was reported through formyl (CHOad) formation during the CO methanation activity. Ciobicaet al. [261] provided theoretical evidence that hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation could proceed on the dense Ru (0001). Alfonso et al. [262] investigated CO methanation's reaction mechanism through first-principles DFT calculations. The results showed that the hydrogen-assisted pathway where CO was hydrogenated to form HCO by the surface H species is more preferred than that involving direct CO dissociation. Former and latter pathways, the predicted free energy barriers are 1.98 and 2.14 eV, respectively. Thus, direct CO dissociation is less kinetically preferred. Yang et al. [263] compared direct CO dissociation to hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation overstepped Ni surfaces with computational analysis. The results showed that the CO dissociation by intermediate CHO was the easiest route for low CO coverage on pure Ni alloy surfaces (211). The priority of hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation could be derived from the more activated C-O bond in CHO or COH. Fig. 26 shows the possible energy profiles of direct and hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation on the Ni (211) surface. Hussain et al. [7,131] elucidated CO methanation studies through in situ FTIR spectroscopy. They reported an associative CO methanation mechanism during the catalytic performance. The CO and H2 molecules were adsorbed at oxygen vacancies, which played a decisive role in the activation process via linearly adsorbed CO * species, which generated methane by hydrogenation of adsorbed C * species, as shown in Fig. 27 . 4.2.2 CO dissociative methanation CO dissociative methanation indicated the breakdown of C-O bonds on active sites immediately before successive steps of hydrogenation. A schematic diagram has been illustrated in Fig. 25. Panagiotopoulou et al. [264] conducted in situ FTIR spectroscopy analysis of CO methanation over Ru-TiO2. They found that CO was disassociated into Cad and Oad, which hydrogenated into methane through associative and dissociative methane pathways with varying temperature and hydrogen contents. Shetty et al. [265] piloted theoretical investigations of CO methanation over a Ru (1121) surface. They reported a lower activation barrier for direct CO dissociation compared to CO associative route. They demonstrated that the 6 times active sites on the Ru (1 1 –2 1) surface (a 4F and bridge combination) was responsible for a low CO dissociation of 65 kJ/mol as shown in Fig. 27 (a-c). Fig. 28 d depicts the energy profiles for these paths. The carbide mechanism (blue line) has 65 kJ/mol, which is the favored route for CO bonding cleavage rather than the hydrogen-assisted. Sehested et al. [266] investigated the mechanistic study of CO methanation over Ni catalyst. They reported an unassisted CO dissociation pathway during CO methanation activity. In another study, Solymosi et al. [267] conducted a CO methanation study over Rh-based catalysts; it was found that CO is dissociated directly without hydrogen. In other studies, similar findings were reported [268–274]."
10,Current challenges and future perspectives,"CO methanation is a potential way to produce SNG, and substantial progress has been made in increasing SNG production efficiency using different appropriate catalysts. However, the comprehensive industrial implementation of CO methanation remains a range of scientific and technological barriers that also core concerns and challenges in current research and development. (1) The CO methanation process has serious problems related to the production of catalysts that are suitable for profitable marketing with high thermal stability and low prices. (2) The CO methanation reaction proceeds with several other side reactions. There is still a lack of information to resolve these side reactions' negative impacts on the production yield of SNG. Further analysis and clarification must also be evaluated to optimize the SNG yield. (3) Expand the existence of metal catalysts by improved thermal stability and avoid possible sintering at high temperatures. (4) Improving the current understanding of reaction mechanisms of CO methanation by kinetics and theoretical studies models.

(8) Improving the mechanical and chemical stability of catalytic coatings by alternative/regenerative approaches to solving the deactivation problem. (9) Improving the mass transfer and heat flow in the integrated and compact heat exchangers of catalytic reactors systems. (a) Techno-economic analysis The production of SNG via catalytic CO methanation is currently subject to extensive analysis, as outlined in previous sections. Despite CO methanation's promising prospects, it still faces some technical challenges about appropriate and efficient catalytic systems. Though full-scale installations are already functioning in many countries, there is still potential for development, and further research is required to generalize the use of the CO methanation model. A techno-economic analysis is an essential element in the succession of the CO methanation model to create an integrated framework. SNG produced by methanation of coal or biomass-derived syngas has to meet an economical price, like natural gas, to be successful and play a significant role in various sectors. Therefore, this model requires low specific capital expenditure by low-price electricity sources with high operating hours. Besides, in economic terms, a cheaper electricity and syngas source must be available for successful marketing. Therefore, a viable CO methanation model would often be correlated with the use of coal or biomass as raw materials to generate syngas. Noticeably, the CO methanation model offers SNG and other goods and amenities, including power generation, heat, and steam, simultaneously, thus increasing the process interest. There are real economic and environmental advantages for the thermochemical methanation route compared to the biological or electrolysis methods. Research efforts have been made to boost catalytic efficiency and reduce the cost of the efficient model of CO methanation. Another fascinating aspect of CO methanation, which could be integrated into the bio-refinery concept by developing various chemicals and fuels, will soon become another essential CO methanation application. (b) policy analysis Governments are considering policy options to promote the use of natural gas over other fossil fuels as well as the feasibility of renewable energy sources, taking into account efforts to minimize carbon dioxide emissions through the Kyoto Protocol and other country-specific initiatives [275]. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [276] and the Paris Agreement [277]. Besides, in 2050, European countries have the ambition to be climate neutral, and this goal is the cornerstone of the European Green Contract [278]. One of the core principles of that treaty is emphasizing energy conservation and building a power system focused primarily on renewable sources. Key elements for achieving this goal are promoting renewable energy sources, such as carbon capture, storage, biomass, and energy conversion. Wind and solar energy are recognized as important advances in this transition's early stages, but their high space–time variability is a noteworthy drawback. Therefore, other alternatives are required that can complement their variations and provide the system with versatility. The production of SNG through CO methanation using the appropriate catalytic system has become an option to satisfy this requirement. As demonstrated in the earlier sections, SNG has several advantages over other fuels. It is an environmentally friendly energy source that emits low carbon emissions than other fossil fuels (coal and petroleum). It can be stored and transported using the current natural gas infrastructure, which is ideal for long-term and large-scale storage, indicating the energy system's great versatility. In consideration as a storage choice, methane has a greater energy density (>1000 kWh m−3) than hydrogen (270 kWh m−3). Because of these international policies and the favorable characteristics of SNG, it appears that SNG production through catalytic CO methanation will hold a prominent position in the modern and sustainable energy paradigm soon, allowing for the endorsement of low CO2 emission scenarios. Based on the insights discussed in this study and the context of the current international policies, the implementation of the CO methanation model can be speeded. The application of SNG would play a greater role in tightening the CO2 net emission target and providing an alternate environmentally friendly energy source since SNG combustion emits 60 percent less CO2 than coal. The development of robust catalytic systems for enhanced CO methanation will be closely associated with more SNG, an economical and sustainable energy source. As the next few years see a huge expansion of solar and wind farms in different countries, this can lead to a significant electricity surplus due to the flexible energy system. Under these circumstances, SNG production through CO methanation also could play an important role. Reducing technology costs and improving the efficiency of the CO methanation model would generate a perception of a lower economic and technical risk that could draw political support for SNG. In the first phases of this new strategy, some regulatory steps to encourage the CO methanation model may be necessary to attract private investors' attention. Certain particular governing steps, including indirect taxes on fossil fuels or direct subsidies to the CO methanation model, could dramatically accelerate commercialization deployments. (c) practical implications of this study It is evident from the findings from this study that the robust catalytic system is a critical factor for catalytic CO methanation towards commercialization. The primary sources of CO and H2 are coal or biomass, which are highly economically viable. Because not only syngas but also electricity can be generated during the gasification of biomass or coal. In today's technological development, thermochemical methanation of syngas is likely to be introduced in full-scale since it generates a better methane production than photocatalytic or electric catalytic systems at the highest levels of reaction. However, new technologies to build cost-effective catalytic systems still need to be investigated. The biological systems can also comply with operational anaerobic digesters, but they face major growth challenges with a lower reaction rate and volumetric mass transmission coefficient than chemical methanation. Thermochemical methanation is rapidly being introduced in many countries, specifically in Europe and many work or planning projects are underway, as shown in Table 8 . Germany is the country leading in this development with the most commonly used electrolyzer of alkaline and polymer electrolyte membrane, following Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The growing technological advancement in costs is remarkable. Fig. 29 shows the current condition of methane production as well as a possible future scenario. In the next 75 years, the cost of methanation is predicted to reduce from around €1000/kWel to under €500/kWel [279]. This fall in costs indicates that the market is implementing catalytic CO methanation to produce substitute natural gas. Lurgi's coal gasification method, invented in Germany in the 1930 s, was the only commercially feasible technology appropriate for the generation of pipeline-quality synthetic natural gas in the 1960 s and 1970 s. In collaboration with Lurgi, a methanation unit consisting of two adiabatic fixed bed reactors with internal recycling has been created. Lurgi designed a variety of pilot plants, including SASOL in Sasolburg (South Africa) and EL Paso Natural Gas Corporation in Schwechat (Austria). As a first pilot plant, a syngas side-stream from the Fischer–Tropsch plant was used to study the methanation process [280–282]. In the commercially available coal gasification plant, the synthesis gas was created using a Rectisol scrubber and a shift conversion. The second pilot plant produces methane by using converted synthesis gas to extract it from naphtha. Over 1.5 years, the pilot plants were operated with two different catalysts: the first, an industrial catalyst with a 20- wt% Ni/Al2O3 ratio, and the second, a unique methanation catalyst with a high nickel concentration (G 1–85). The experiment with the first catalyst revealed that the catalyst deactivated quite quickly. After 32% of the catalyst's consumption, the adiabatic equilibrium temperature of 450 °C was obtained for the second catalyst. The role of hydrogen sulfide was investigated, and conversion rates of 6.3% and 23.8% of the total catalyst bed, respectively, were obtained in the experiments. The setup was run with the Rectisol scrubbing unit and a ZnO-bed from 750 to 950 h, which reduces the total quantity of sulfur to 0.04 and 0.02 mg / m N 3 for H2S. [282]. Kim et al. [283] fabricated Co–Fe–Al catalysts using the coprecipitation method and extended them to pilot scale for high-calorific synthetic natural gas. The FTIR, H2-TPR, XRD, and BET techniques were used to examine the Co–Fe–Al catalysts with varying metal loadings. Increased metal loading of the Co–Fe–Al catalysts resulted in a lower spinel phase ratio, which improved reducibility. Among the catalysts tested, the 40CFAl catalyst created in the laboratory yielded the best C2–C4 hydrocarbon time yield, and this catalyst was effectively replicated at the pilot scale. The pilot-scale pelletized catalyst demonstrated strong CO conversion (87.6%), good light hydrocarbon selectivity (59.3% for CH4 and 18.8% for C2–C4), and minimal byproduct quantities."
11,Conclusions,"Since the early 1900 s, CO methanation has been a subject of considerable research interest. While this reaction is straightforward in principle, it presents a learning curve due to its low catalytic efficacy and very exothermic nature. Many top-notch efforts have been undertaken in recent years to create high-activity catalysts that are cost-effective, robust, practical, and sustainable for commercializing CO methanation. Reviews on reactor design, process setup, and thermodynamics have covered a wide range of topics in-depth for CO methanation. The scientific literature has a few papers on catalytic systems, which are necessary for high CO methanation activity. Emphasis should be placed on gaining a full understanding of the synergistic interactions between catalyst components (support, active metal, promoter), to improve catalytic performance and stability throughout the CO methanation reaction. Intending to identify potentials and key difficulties for increased CO methanation activity, we have conducted an analytical analysis of aspects of robust catalytic systems. We have thoroughly examined the new and emerging innovative catalysts, particularly those that have been synthesized utilizing unique production methods, supporting materials, and promoters. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), carbons, and fibrous support materials, for example, provide a formidable foundation for the development of versatile, efficient, and stable catalysts for CO methanation, among other applications. We have found that appropriate tuning of interactions between active metal, support, and promoter to achieve higher CO methanation activity is an excellent way to design the catalysts. Besides, the reaction mechanism of CO methanation always has been a great challenge and in the debate. We reviewed several experimental and theoretical studies for CO methanation. Specifically, it was investigated how methanation catalysts were deactivated, what factors influenced this process, if such an attempt had been made, and whether it was possible to control the deactivation process. As a result of side reactions, such as the Boudouard reaction (2CO (g) ⇌ C + CO2 (g)) and methane cracking (CH4 (g) ⇌ C + 2H2 (g)), CO methanation catalysts are deactivated. Numerous ways have been investigated to circumvent this difficulty, including modifying reaction conditions, adding promoters, and different methods of catalyst synthesis. The stability of the catalysts is particularly crucial when it comes to CO methanation because extreme environmental conditions can cause physical and chemical deactivation of the catalysts, which can lead to their catalytic failures. Two types of mechanisms can be identified for CO methanation: associative and dissociative methanation. C-O bond cleavage occurs through a hydrogen-assisted method, where it works to help in the direct separation of adsorbed CO (i.e., without assistance from hydrogen). The in-depth investigation of the catalytic system and mechanism represents key advances of enormous significance in the field of CO methanation for addressing the global energy problem and promoting the sustainable energy development of our planet."
