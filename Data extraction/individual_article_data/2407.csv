0,Introduction,"An increasing number of chiral compounds and enantiomerically pure drugs are prepared through transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric reactions [1]. Since the reactivity and stereoselectivity of an asymmetric transformation are highly dependent on the structure of the chiral ligand coordinated to the transition metal, the design and synthesis of efficient chiral ligands are important in this area and have attracted a great deal of attention both from academia and industry [2]. For many years, a large number of chiral monodendate and bidendate phosphorus containing ligands (P,P′) were widely studied [3,4]. Among the recently developed transition-metal-based chiral reduction catalysts, the C 2-symmetric ferrocenyl phosphines were notably reported [5–8]. Because of its great success in catalytic asymmetric reactions [9], chiral ferrocenyl-phosphine ligands have attracted considerable attention in recent years [10,11]. These ligands are very efficient for a wide range of reactions, such as hydrogenation [12], hydrosilylation [13], allylic alkylation [14], palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [15–17] and cyclopropanation [18]. Although ferrocenyl phosphine ligands have found widespread applications in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation [19–21], the analogous phosphinites have scarcely been reported, which have different chemical, electronic and structural advantages in comparison with phosphines. For instance, the metal-phosphorus bond is often stronger in phosphinites compared to the related phosphine due to the presence of electron-withdrawing P-OR group. In addition, the empty σ*-orbital of the phosphinite P(OR)R2 is stabilized, making the phosphinite a better acceptor [22]. The most important advantage of chiral phosphinite ligands over the corresponding P-based ligands is their facile preparation, which leads to a substantial interest to design highly effective chiral phosphinite ligands for asymmetric catalysis [23–25]. Catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of ketones has recently emerged as a viable means of synthesizing chiral alcohols [26]. Due to operational simplicity, the easy availability of reductants, and the high enantioselectivity, the catalytic enantioselective reduction of ketones has been extensively studied during the last decades [27]. Particularly, asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones has recently developed as an alternative method to asymmetric hydrogenation for the production of chiral alcohols [28–30]. Because hydrogen transfer reactions are mild techniques for reduction of ketones in which a substrate-selective catalyst transfers hydrogen between the substrate and a hydrogen donor or acceptor, respectively. Additionally, the donor (e.g. 2-propanol) and the acceptor (e.g. a ketone) are environmentally friendly and also easy to handle [31,32]. Chiral β-amino alcohols are useful building blocks for biologically active compounds [33] as well as important auxiliaries and ligands in asymmetric synthesis [34]. Also, amino alcohols continue to be of importance in modern synthetic chemistry, not only because of their biological properties, but also due to their wide range of synthetic applications [35]. Hence, the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically enriched amino alcohols has been extensively studied. Especially, amino alcohol derivative catalysts have received much attention and used in many asymmetric catalysis reactions, and they have shown powerful utilities in the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones [36,37]. In recent years, we have reported the synthesis and applications of a number of modified Ru(II) catalysts for ATH which contain well designed groups formed by the reaction of between the chiral ligand component and the η6-arene ring [38–41]. We report here the synthesis of two novel phosphinite ligands and their application in the Ru(II)-catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of various ketones [42–44]. A comparison of the results obtained with the newly synthesized ligands and those of the corresponding Ru(II) complexes is also discussed. The comparison concerns the structural features of ligands, four of their ruthenium complexes, and the hydrogenation results."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Synthesis and characterization of the amino alcohols and phosphinite ligands,"2.1 Synthesis and characterization of the amino alcohols and phosphinite ligands First of all, the precursor chiral secondary amine, N-benzyl-N-[(S)-1-[α-naphthylethyl]amine (2) was readily synthesized by the reaction of (S)-(-)-1-[naphthalen-1-yl-ethy]amine with benzaldehyde with procedures previously described, as shown in Scheme 1 [45,46]. It is well-known that the regioselective ring opening of epoxides by amines is an important way for the preparation of β-aminoalcohols [47]. Thus, two novel chiral amino alcohols, 3 and 4, were synthesized by the ring opening reaction of N-benzyl-N-(S)-1-[α-naphthylethyl]amine 2 with (R)-styrene oxide or (S)-glycidyl phenyl ether, respectively (Scheme 1) [48]. The products were fully characterized by several spectroscopic methods: LC-ESI-IT-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR as well as elemental analysis. The assignment of the 1H chemical shifts was derived from 2D HH-COSY spectra and the appropriate assignment of the 13C chemical shifts from APT and 2D HMQC spectra. The results were given in experimental section with full details. Furthermore, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and LC-ESI-IT-TOF MS spectra of amino alcohols also given in Supporting Information (SI). The synthetic procedure for the preparation of the phosphinite ligands [49] is shown in Scheme 1. Chiral monodendate C 1-symmetric ligands 5 and 6 were synthesized by hydrogen abstraction from the described chiral amino alcohols by Et3N and the subsequent reaction with one equivalent of Ph2PCl in anhydrous CH2Cl2 under inert argon atmosphere with the hydrolysis reaction [50]. Typical spectra of these ligands are illustrated in supporting information (SI) and for details see experimental Section (see Scheme 2 ). It is well-known that the phosphinite ligands are mostly unstable and decompose gradually to give oxide and the hydrolysis product diphenylphosphinous acid, Ph2P(O)H [51]. Furthermore, the 31P-{1H} NMR spectrum displays formation of PPh2PPh2 and P(O)Ph2PPh2, as indicated by signals at about δ −15.4 ppm as singlet and δ 35.0 ppm and at δ −21.6 ppm as doublets with 1 J (PP) 226 Hz, respectively [52]. These two compounds are very stable in ambient atmosphere up to 24 h because of the well-designed structures. The progress of preparation reactions of the ligands was conveniently monitored by 31P-{1H} NMR spectroscopy. The signals of the starting material PPh2Cl at δ = 81.0 ppm disappeared and new singlets appeared downfield due to the phosphinite ligands. The 31P-{1H} NMR spectra of the free ligands are in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds [53,54]. Typical spectra of these ligands are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of these ligands are also conclusive. The resonance assignments were made on the basis of 1H-1H COSY, NOESY, and 1H-13C COSY experiments. Typical spectra of these ligands are illustrated in supporting information (SI) and for details see experimental Section. Following a similar procedure described by Sawamura, Regadec et al. [55], ruthenium(II) complexes of the phosphinite ligands, (1R)-2-{benzyl[(1S)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]amino}-1-phenylethyl diphenylphosphite, 5 and (2S)-1-{benzyl[(1S)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]amino}-3-phenoxypropan-2-yldiphenyl phosphinite, 6 were readily prepared in quantitative yields by reacting the appropriate ligands with either [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 or [Ru(η6-benzene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 precursor as outlined in Scheme 1. The ability of dimers {[Ru(arene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2} to form mono- or binuclear complexes of general formula [Ru(η6-arene)Cl2L] is well-known [56]. For synthesis of ruthenium(II) complexes 7 and 9, [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 was initially chosen as a starting material, which was prepared from the reaction of the commercially available α-phellandrene(5-isoprophyl-2-methylcyclohexa-1,3-diene) with RuCl3 [57]. The p-cymene ligand is particularly informative with respect to the symmetry of the three legged fragment [58]. One of the most available arene ligands in ruthenium chemistry is p-cymene, whose NMR signals are very sensitive to the symmetry of organometallic compound [59]. Thus, when it is η6-coordinated to a ML2L′ metal fragment (Cs symmetry), the 1H and 13C NMR spectra are very different from that of η6-coordinated to a ML1L2L3 fragment (C 1 symmetry) [60]. In this case, the steric hindrance of amino alcohol phosphinite ligands seems to prevent free rotation of p-cymene ligand around the arene-Ru axis [61]. In addition, the detailed analysis of NOE interaction between p-cymene and other ligands can give valuable information about the relative orientation of different groups in the molecule and thus establish the stereochemistry of the complex (for details see experimental section). After the preparation of the second precursor [Ru(η6-benzene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 by the reaction cyclo-1.3-hexadiene with RuCl3 in aqueous solution, we synthesized (2S)-1-{[(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino}propan-2-yldiphenylphosphinito [dichloro(η6-benzene) ruthenium (II)], 8 and (2S)-1-{[(2S)-2-[(diphenylphosphanyl)oxy]propyl][(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino} propan-2-yldiphenylphosphinitobis[dichloro(η6-benzene) ruthenium (II)], 10 complexes with high yields Scheme 1. The poor solubility of the starting benzene derivative causes a decrease in the yields of the complexes (8 and 10), which are more conveniently prepared by the reaction of the phosphinites with the monomeric adduct [RuCl2(C6H6)(NCCH3)] [62]. Analysis of complexes 8 and 10 by 1H NMR exhibits multiplet signals corresponding to the aromatic rings for at 8.06–7.58 and 7.94–7.09 ppm and the C6H6 protons as singlets at 4.95 and 5.47 ppm, respectively. The Ru-arene complexes were isolated as indicated by singlets in their 31P-{1H} NMR spectra at approximately δ 104–111 ppm, in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds (Fig. 1) [63,64]. 1H NMR spectra of these compounds clearly exhibit signals corresponding to the aromatic rings. The arene resonances are well resolved, as in the previously reported for mononuclear arene complexes [59]. In the 13C-{1H} NMR spectra of complexes, J(31P-13C) coupling constants of the carbons of the phenyl rings were observed, which are in agreement with the literature (for details see experimental Section) [65]. The structure of Ru(II)-complexes were further confirmed by IR spectroscopy as well as microanalysis, and found to be consistent to expected structures."
3,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones,"2.2 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones The admirable catalytic performance and the advanced structural permutability of phosphinite based transition metal complexes prompted us to improve new Ru(II) complexes with well-shaped ligands [66,67]. We paid particular attention to arene ligands [68], because (i) the spectator ligands automatically occupy three adjacent coordination sites of ruthenium in an octahedral coordination environment, leaving three facial sites for other functions, (ii) arene ligands that are relatively weak electron donors may provide a unique reactivity on the metallic center, and (iii) the substitution pattern on the ring is flexible. To take account of these advantages, complexes 7–10 were tested as catalysts in transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in a i PrOH solution. First of all, compounds 7–10 were used as precatalysts, i PrOH/KOH as a reducing system, and acetophenone as a model substrate. To evaluate the efficiency of our Ru(II) complexes, we deeply investigated the optimal conditions starting with acetophenone as a standard test reaction. Results for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones with catalysts, 7–10 are collected in Table 1 . Catalytic experiments were carried out under argon using standard Schlenk-line techniques. To an i PrOH solution of each complex, appropriate amounts of acetophenone and KOH/ i PrOH solution were added at room temperature. The solution was stirred, and the reaction was monitored by GC. The reactions proceeded to give (R) or (S)-1-phenyl ethanol in 12–28% conversion with 72–91% ee's after stirring at room temperature for 96 h. An increase in the reaction time to 144 h resulted in 22–53% conversion with 65–87% ee's. Due to the reversibility at room temperature, prolonging the reaction time led to a slight decrease in enantioselectivity. However, when the reactions were carried out at 82 °C, all complexes showed satisfactory catalytic activity (up to 196 TOF values) and enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee) since almost quantitative conversions were observed (Table 1, entries 9–12). These results clearly indicate that the reaction temperature plays an important role on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. The ruthenium(II) complexes were very active catalysts, leading to quantitative conversions of (R) or (S)-1-phenyl ethanol with a catalyst/base ratio of 1:5 (Table 1, entries 13–16). A control experiment in the absence of base did not lead to significant conversion (Entries 5–8). Furthermore, replacing KOH with NaOH slightly decreased both the reaction rate and enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 9–12[e]). Increase or decrease of the base:Cat ratio from 5:1 to 9:1 or 3:1 slightly decrease the reaction with a slight loss of enantiomeric purity of the product (Table 1, entries 13–16). From the results, it can be obviously seen that generally complex 9 and 10, which include -CH2OPh instead of –Ph moiety on the phosphinite skeleton showed higher catalytic activity than complexes, 7 and 8. Furthermore, the complexes (1R)-2-{benzyl[(1S)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]amino}-1-phenylethyl diphenylphosphinito[dichloro(η6-benzene)ruthenium (II)], 8 and (2S)-1-{benzyl[(1S)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]amino}-3-phenoxypropan-2-yl diphenylphosphini-to [dichloro(η6-benzene) ruthenium (II)], 10 which have benzene fragment are more active than the complexes, 7 and 9 which include more commonly used p-cymene fragment. The good enantioselectivity obtained for initial reduction of acetophenone led us to keep employing Ru-benzene complexes. These results clearly indicate that the skeleton of the phosphinite ligands and the fragment attached to the ruthenium center are responsible for the high conversion (up to 99%) and enantioselectivity (up to 96 ee %), whatever the exact reaction mechanism. The best results were obtained in the (2S)-1-{benzyl[(1S)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]amino}-3-phenoxypropan-2-yldiphenylphosphinito [dichloro(η6-benzene)ruthenium (II)], 10 catalytic system with up to 96% ee and 98% conversion. Under optimized conditions, aromatic ketones were hydrogenated with high enantioselectivity and the same mode face selection. Table 2 illustrates conversions of the reduction performed in a 0.1 M of isoPrOH solution containing 7–10 and KOH (Ketone:Cat:KOH = 100:1:5). One can easily see from the results that a range of acetophenone derivatives can be hydrogenated with high enantioselectivities. Electronic properties (the nature as well as position) of the substituents on the phenyl ring of the ketone caused the changes in the reduction rate and enantioselectivity. It is well-known that the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to the aryl ring of the ketone decreases the electron density of the C=O bond so that the activity was improved resulting in easier hydrogenation [69–71]. Therefore, the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as CF3 or NO2, to the aryl ring of the ketone, led to improved activity with good enantioselectivity (Table 2, entries 1–16). On the contrary, the introduction of an electron-donating group such as methyl or methoxy group decelerates the reaction with similar enantioselectivity, whatever the position of substitution (Table 2, entries 17–36). It can be seen from Table 2, ortho-substituted acetophenones can dramatically increase the enantioselectivity, while meta- and para-substitution to ring of the ketone caused the changes in the reduction rate and enantioselectivity. As expected, the lowest enantioselectivity was observed in transfer hydrogenation of p-methoxyacetophenone, whereas the highest one was found in that of m-methoxyacetophenone (96% ee). Overall, the chiral efficiency attains a very high level in the asymmetric reduction of aromatic ketones and compares well with the recently discovered catalyst systems [72,73]. Complexes 7–10 were further investigated in transfer hydrogenation of a variety of ketones to be converted to the corresponding chiral alcohols under the optimum conditions. The reaction of methyl/alkyl or methyl/aryl ketones gave the corresponding chiral alcoholic products in an acceptable chemical yield and enantiomeric purity. Firstly, we carried out further experiments to study the influence of bulkiness of the alkyl groups on the catalytic activity and selectivity (Table 3 , entries 1–16). For this aim, a variety of simple aryl/alkyl ketones were transformed to the corresponding secondary alcohols, and it was found that the activity and selectivity are extremely dependent on the steric hindrance of the alkyl group. Reaction of methyl/alkyl ketones possessing a bulky alkyl substituent proceeded rather sluggish and led a decrease in enantioselectivity. As the bulkiness of the alkyl group increases from ethyl to sec-butyl, the level of enantioselectivity lowers. Indeed, lower activity and enantioselectivity were obtained in case of methyl sec-butyl ketone (Entries 13–16, 61–80% ee) [74–77]. Furthermore, as seen in Table 3, the best result in terms of enantioselectivity was observed with 1-naphtyl methyl ketone (up to 97% ee, entries 17–20). In that case, the highest enantioselectivity, up to 98% ee, were obtained for catalyst (2S)-1-{benzyl[(1S)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]amino}-3-phenoxypropan-2-yldiphenylphosphinito[dichloro(η6-benzene) ruthenium(II)] (10). Furthermore, the hydrogenation of ketones including cyclohexyl group was very slow and the enantioselectivities were remarkable lower (Table 3, entries 25–32)."
4,Conclusion and perspectives,"This work presents new chiral phosphinite ligands which form highly efficient and practical catalysts with ruthenium precursor for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of aryl/alkyl ketones. High conversion and enantioselectivity were obtained in the catalytic reaction. The high catalytic activity and enantioselectivity for this kind of ligands show great potential for further exploring similar system and achieving outstanding stereoselectivity for a wider scope of ketone substrates. Furthermore, the simplicity and efficiency clearly make it an excellent choice of catalyst for the practical preparation of highly valued alcohols via catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones."
