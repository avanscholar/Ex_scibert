0,Introduction,"H2O2 is an ecofriendly oxidant for organic synthesis, pulp bleaching, wastewater treatment, and disinfection [1]. Commercial H2O2 is mainly produced by anthraquinone method, which needs multisteps and requires large amounts of energy and organic solvent [2]. As a promising alternative to anthraquinone method, direct H2O2 synthesis through photocatalytic pathway has attracted extensive interest in view of its mild reaction conditions, such as room temperature, normal pressure and light irradiation. In the past few decades, various photocatalysts have been developed for H2O2 production, such as TiO2 [3–8], ZnO [9,10], BiVO4 [11] and g-C3N4 [12–14]. Among these materials, metal-free g-C3N4 (CN) is a widely investigated photocatalyst owing to visible light active [15], highly stable, eco-friendly [16–20] and cost-effective features [21]. However, the readily recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes suppresses the photocatalytic activity of CN [22]. Various strategies were employed recently to improve the performance of CN for H2O2 synthesis, such as imides grafting [13,21,23,24] and heteroelements doping [25,26]. However, these methods still have the disadvantages of poor yield of H2O2 or unstable H2O2 evolution rate. Loading catalytically active metal nanoparticles (NPs) on photocatalyst is one of the most effective approaches to improve the photocatalytic activity by promoting the charge separation and selectively catalyzing relevant reactions [27,28]. The enhancement effect of Au NPs for H2O2 generation has been demonstrated over TiO2 and BiVO4 photocatalysts [5,11]. Shiraishi [29] loaded Pt on CN and found that the photocatalytic H2O2 production is even lower than the pristine CN due to the high H2O2 decomposition rate over Pt [30]. A further investigation about the influence of Au cocatalysts on the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis over CN, however, has yet been studied. Considering that 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction over Au are very favorable [31,32], this motivated us to design Au/CN hybrid for photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Our results found that the finely dispersed Au as well as Ag NPs are outstanding cocatalysts to improve the photocatalytic activity of CN for H2O2 synthesis. In addition, Au/CN hybrid is very inert for H2O2 decomposition, which is beneficial to keep photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate stable. It is very interesting that the maximal H2O2 production activity can be reached at the Au loading amount as low as 0.01%, implying that Au NPs are more favorable for H2O2 generation. In situ ESR reveals that the H2O2 is efficiently formed through a direct two-electron reduction process and no single-electron reduction intermediate (•OOH) was observed during photocatalytic reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (CN),2.1 Preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (CN) The pristine CN was prepared by direct thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide at 823 K for 4 h with a ramping rate of 3 K/min in air [33]. The resultant yellow CN powder was grinded for further use.
3,Preparation of Au/CN,"2.2 Preparation of Au/CN 2.0 g of CN was added into 200 ml of distilled water containing HAuCl4·4H2O (0.209 mg). Solvents were removed by evaporation at 353 K with vigorous stirring. The obtained powder was reduced by KBH4 with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 3 h. Finally, the obtained suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm, washed with deionized water three or four times and dried at 353 K. The prepared sample was named as 0.005% Au/CN. Accordingly 0.01% Au/CN, 0.05% Au/CN and 0.1% Au/CN photocatalysts were prepared by the same procedure by varying only the quantity of the HAuCl4·4H2O. 0.01% Pt/CN, 0.01% Ag/CN and 0.01% Pd/CN photocatalysts were prepared by the same method using H2PtCl6·6H2O, AgNO3 and PdCl2."
4,Materials characterizations,"2.3 Materials characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Ma-2500) operating with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra were obtained on an UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750 S UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer) with BaSO4 as a reference. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer LS55 Fluorescence Spectrometer. TEM observations were performed using a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, JEOL JEM-ARM200f) operated at 200 kV. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded on a JES-FA200 Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer. The Agilent 8800 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied to determine Au loading amounts in samples. The actual percentage of Au in 0.005% Au/CN, 0.01% Au/CN, 0.05% Au/CN, 0.1% Au/CN were 0.003%, 0.016%, 0.085%, 0.121%, respectively."
5,ESR test,"2.4 ESR test Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping reagent has been performed to confirm the pathway of O2 reduction over different catalysts. Typically, catalyst (20 mg) was added to an alcohol/water mixture (1/9 v/v, 5 ml) containing DMPO (0.125 mmol) within a container. After O2 bubbling for 3 min, the container was photo irradiated for 5 min. The catalyst was recovered by filtration, and the solution was subjected to analysis at room temperature."
6,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity test H2O2 production was carried out in a top-irradiation reaction vessel containing 400 mg of the catalyst powder and 10 ml of C2H5OH as an electron donor in an aqueous solution (100 ml, pH = 8.5). The reaction solution was sonicated for 3 min and stirred to disperse photocatalyst. O2 was bubbled beforehand for 30 min prior to photoirradiation under visible light (UVCUT420, λ > 420 nm) using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SEX300BF, Beijing Perfect Light Co. LTD). The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at room temperature. The concentrations of H2O2 were determined by a spectrophotometric method using copper (II) ion and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DMP) [34]."
7,H2O2 decomposition test,"2.6 H2O2 decomposition test Decomposition of H2O2 was carried out in a top-irradiation reaction vessel containing 400 mg of the catalyst powder and 100 ml of alcohol/water mixture (1/9 v/v). The reaction solution was sonicated for 3 min and stirred to disperse photocatalyst. The initial concentration of H2O2 is 3500 μM. N2 was bubbled beforehand for 30 min to exhaust O2 in the reaction solution prior to photoirradiation under visible light (UVCUT420, λ > 420 nm). The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at room temperature using a flow of cooling water during the reaction. The concentrations of undecomposed H2O2 were determined by a spectrophotometric method using copper (II) ion and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DMP) [34]."
8,Results and discussion,"Both 0.01% Au/CN and CN have similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and two characteristic peaks can be obviously identified at 12.8° and 27.4° assigned to C3N4 (Fig. S1a) [17]. The diffraction peaks of Au NPs are not observed due to the very low loading amount [35]. The UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectra of 0.01% Au/CN and CN (Fig. S1b) show wide photoabsorption in visible region. The STEM images display that CN exhibits a sheet-like structure. The nanometal cocatalyst exhibit lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.237 nm, which matches the Au (111) plane (Fig. S2) [28]. The average size of Au nanoparticles are 2–3 nm in diameters, which are finely dispersed on CN (Fig. S1c-f). The photocatalytic activity of H2O2 synthesis over Au/CN hybrids was tested under visible light and a spectrophotometric method involving cupric ions and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DMP) was used to quantify the H2O2 concentrations [34]. The standard curve indicated that the absorbance and concentration of H2O2 exhibits a good linear relationship with correlation coefficient of 0.9956 (Fig. S3). Compared with pristine CN, Au/CN hybrids exhibited remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity (Fig. 1a). CN with Au loading amount as low as 0.01% demonstrated the best photocatalytic activity and produces 2027 μM H2O2 within 30 h' irradiation. Further increasing Au loading amount on CN will decrease the photocatalytic activity. It has been evidenced that the photocatalytic activity is sensitive to the Au loading amount [35]. High Au loading amount will possibly hinder the light absorption of CN and decrease photocatalytic activity. A comparison study using different cocatalysts on CN for H2O2 production was carried out (Fig. 1b). All hybrid photocatalysts exhibited improved activity with a trend of Au > Ag > Pd > Pt, showing that Au and Ag are excellent cocatalysts of CN for H2O2 production from a 2-electron oxygen reduction process [31,32]. The activity of Ag/CN for H2O2 synthesis was also conducted and the optimum Ag loading amount is 0.03% (Fig. S4). We also found that the An/CN hybrid photocatalyst of this work also showed superior performance to the typical reaction systems reported recently (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 2a, a broad emission peak centered at ∼460 nm can be observed due to the band-band photoluminescence (PL) phenomenon of CN [36]. In contrast, 0.01% Au/CN presents much quenched PL signal, suggesting that the recombination of charge carriers in CN was suppressed. The efficient separation of charge carriers between the finely dispersed Au NPs and CN is beneficial for enhancing H2O2 production (Fig. 2b). Being different from many other photocatalytic reactions, the photocatalytic H2O2 formation is always accompanied by H2O2 decomposition, leading to the fact that most of the photocatalytic H2O2 formation processes in the reported reaction systems are catalytically unsustainable and a saturated concentration of H2O2 were reached after a certain reaction period [2,3,13,25]. In order to obtain a photocatalytic reaction system that can produce concentrated H2O2, it is crucial to suppress such decomposition process to keep H2O2 evolution as sustainable as possible. Fig. 3a shows the decomposition of H2O2 over different photocatalysts under visible irradiation. All the decomposition processes can be fitted with a zero-order equation (linear relationship). It is very interesting that the H2O2 decomposition over 0.01% Au/CN almost has not occurred. This is possibly because the kinetic process of the activation of 2-electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 formation over Au is very easy [32], whereas further catalytic decomposition of H2O2 becomes unfavorable. It is well known that Pt is highly active for H2O2 decomposition via dissociative adsorption on its surface [31]. Consequently, 0.01% Pt/CN showed highest decomposition rate. In order to further study the reaction mechanism of H2O2 formation over the photocatalysts, in situ ESR analysis (Fig. 3b) is used to record the free radical signal produced in photocatalytic process. In general, H2O2 can be produced by stepwise single-electron reduction process with •OOH as reaction intermediate or through a direct 2-electron oxygen reduction process. In contrast to the formation of single-electron oxygen reduction intermediate (•OOH) in photocatalytic H2O2 production over TiO2, •OOH signal can not be observed during H2O2 formation over CN-based photocatalysts in the in situ ESR spectra, indicating that H2O2 was produced from direct 2-electron oxygen reduction in this work. This result is consistent with Shiraishi's study [29]."
9,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we obtained Au/CN as a simple photocatalysts for direct H2O2 production in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. The finely dispersed Au cocatalyst remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis over CN. Au/CN is very inert to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 during the reaction and thus it can maintain an efficient and stable H2O2 yield. Therefore, in comparison with many other photocatalytic reaction systems, the Au/CN hybrid even with very low Au loading amount allows the production of concentrated H2O2 in aqueous solution through photocatalytic method. In addition to H2O2 synthesis, Au/CN can be potentially used for photocatalytic environmental purification on the basis of Fenton oxidation."
