0,Introduction,"Recent food perception trends are for healthy and sustainable foods. Aside from promoting a healthy and long-term eating pattern, consumer preference is also for foods that are easy to prepare (Cho, Kim, Kim, Park, & Rhee, 2020). Fish fillets, which are ready for immediate consumption, have recently become extensively accessible in supermarkets. Thus, cold-stable, ready-to-cook fish fillet offers a significant food industry opportunity. Fish is one of the most widely consumed protein sources in comparison to other meats since it is high in necessary amino acids and easy to digest in the human body (Sampels, 2014). However, fish is more perishable than other meats due to the presence of abundant nutrients, high moisture content, and neutral pH, making retail handling problematic. The freshness and safety of fish, which are economically preserved via cold storage, are the most important quality features for consumer acceptability (Chaijan, Panpipat, Panya, Cheong, & Chaijan, 2020). Chilled storage alone is insufficient for controlling biochemical reactions and bacteriological activity in fish, particularly in the form of fillet (Cai et al., 2014). Furthermore, one of the most common customer concerns in handling fresh fish prior to home meal preparation is pathogen growth (Cho et al., 2020). As a result, the use of green technology to extend the shelf-life of fish at a low cost remains necessary and challenging in order to improve the cold storage shelf-life of fresh fish. Cold plasma is a new chemical-free, environmentally friendly preservative that has been extensively researched for food safety purposes. Furthermore, plasma-activated water (PAW) is often obtained by discharging cold plasma above or beneath the water surface, resulting in the formation of secondary reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals (OH•), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), singlet oxygen, superoxide, ozone, nitric oxide, and nitrates (Zhang et al., 2017). Because of their efficiency against food spoilage microorganisms and pathogens, both cold plasma and PAW have recently attracted increased attention in the preservation of fresh products such as fruits, vegetables, and meats, as well as processed foods (Liao et al., 2017). Several investigations have shown that cold plasma treatment can be used to pasteurize meat with little adverse effects on sensory quality and chemical deterioration such as fat and protein oxidation (Bauer et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Ulbin-Figlewicz, Brychcy, & Jarmoluk, 2015; Zhuang et al., 2019). However, Olatunde, Benjakul, and Vongkamjan (2020) claimed that lipid oxidation still occurred, limiting the use of cold plasma in the preservation of sea bass. Olatunde et al. (2020) demonstrated the combined effect of high voltage cold plasma and liposomal coconut husk extract on chilled sea bass preservation, which might potentially extend the shelf-life by at least 18 days. Typically, the disadvantage of using cold plasma in fresh fish is that it has a restricted penetration, resulting in inefficient inactivation in the internal surfaces of the fillet. PAW typically has a deeper penetration and an extra potential washing function (Zhao, Ojha, Burgess, Sun, & Tiwari, 2021), which may have a higher preservation impact against bacteria than regular cold plasma discharge. Furthermore, the active species in PAW remain stable throughout time, confirming the antibacterial capabilities of the compound (Xu, Tian, Ma, Liu, & Zhang, 2016). PAW has recently piqued the interest of food scientists for its ability to inhibit a wide spectrum of bacteria and enzymes (Misra, Pankaj, Segat, & Ishikawa, 2016). All reactive species and the acidic environment, which can destroy cell membranes and damage DNA and protein within microbial cells, are linked to PAW's synergistic bactericidal effects (Xiang et al., 2019). Efficacy of PAW in microbial inactivation of fresh fruits and vegetables such as strawberry (Ma et al., 2015), button mushroom (Xu et al., 2016), fresh-cut pears (Chen et al., 2019), fresh-cut apple (Liu et al., 2020), and fresh-cut kiwifruit (Liu et al., 2020) was investigated in numerous studies (Zhao et al., 2019). However, there have been few research on the use of PAW to preserve aquatic food, particularly fresh fish fillet. Since various processing factors, such as power input (Pemen et al., 2017), plasma treatment mode (Lu, Patil, Keener, Cullen, & Bourke, 2014), feeding gas (Baik et al., 2013), and storage temperature (Shen et al., 2016), have been shown to influence PAW biocidal potency, further research into the effect of PAW processing factors, particularly working gas type, is still needed to maximize PAW food preservation. According to Vlad and Anghel (2017), processing parameters have a direct impact on the type and concentration of ROS produced in the PAW. In this study, we aimed to provide a novel concept of using PAW with a high H2O2 concentration (100 ppm) and a short exposure duration to maintain fresh-cut fish safety while having minor negative impacts on fish physicochemical features. H2O2 was chosen as an effective species because its half-life is longer than that of other ROS (half-life 10–20 min) (Kim et al., 2013). The Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer), a white muscular fish, was used as a model for a thorough quality evaluation during refrigerated storage. Asian sea bass is a popular farm-raised fish species found throughout the Western Pacific, the Arabian Sea, China, Taiwan, and Thailand, and has a high market value (Venkatachalam, Kandasamy, Krishnamoorthy, & Narayanasamy, 2018). The safety and overall quality of the Asian sea bass steaks were assessed during cold storage by immersing them in PAW produced by two feeding gases, oxygen and argon, for 30–120 s. The results of this technology can be used as a guide to establish the overall features of a chilled, ready-to-cook fresh cut sea bass steak that is economically feasible."
1,Material and methods,
2,Preparation of plasma-activated water (PAW),"2.1 Preparation of plasma-activated water (PAW) Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup for producing 1 L of PAW. PAW was created inside the vacuum chamber. The pressure in the chamber was controlled by a water-ring vacuum pump and a leak valve, with a baseline pressure of 49 Torr. The working gas for PAW production was oxygen (O2) or argon (Ar). A stainless rod, glass tube, gas inlet, and RF high-voltage input made up the electrode set. The stainless rod was placed into the glass tube, and the tube's top end was attached to the high-voltage RF source. Gas was pumped into the glass tube at a rate of 1 L/min from the upper part, then released at a pressure of 200 Torr at the open end. When RF high-voltage of 10 kV, about 28 W was supplied to the electrode, filamentary discharge occurred between the tip of the electrode and the water's surface. PAW with H2O2 of 100 ppm, measured by MQuant® Peroxide Test strips (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), was obtained for 90 min of the discharge. The dipping experiment was conducted using the newly made PAW."
3,Fish steaks preparation and treatment,"2.2 Fish steaks preparation and treatment Farm-raised Asian sea bass with an average weight of 1110 ± 20 g were purchased from the Thasala market in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. The fish were delivered to the laboratory at Walailak University, within 20 min. Then, the steaks were made from the skinned fillet (4 × 8 × 2.5 cm; width × length × height) using the procedure of Chaijan et al. (2020). The sea bass steaks were dipped into freshly prepared PAW at a ratio of 1:3 (w/v) with different contact times (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 s). After draining for 1 min, each sample was placed on a polystyrene tray for 1 min before being wrapped in polyethylene bags and heat-sealed with an impulse sealer. All samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 ± 0.5 °C for 30 days. Fish steaks were randomly selected (n = 3) for the quality analysis every 5 days. All measurements were made by three separated lots with triplicate determinations."
4,Determination of microbiological quality,"2.3 Determination of microbiological quality The total viable count (TVC), total psychrophilic bacterial count (TPC) and Pseudomonas spp. count (PSC) were determined according to the procedure of Maqsood and Benjakul (2011). The sample (25 g) was mixed with 225 mL of 0.85% sterile saline solution. The mixture was then homogenized using a Stomacher (Mode 1400, Seward Ltd. West Sussex, England) for 2 min at 220 rpm. Homogenate was serially diluted ten-fold in 0.85% sterile saline solution. TVC and TPC counts were determined using plate count agar and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and 4 °C for 10 days, respectively. PSC counts were enumerated on Pseudomonas isolation agar, after incubation at 25 °C for 3 days. The values were reported as log10 CFU/g."
5,Off-flavor analysis,"2.4 Off-flavor analysis The total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) content was analyzed using Conway and Byrne (1936). According to Chaijan et al. (2020), trimethylamine (TMA) and propanal concentrations were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry."
6,Chemical and biochemical analyses,"2.5 Chemical and biochemical analyses 2.5.1 Determination of lipid oxidation The primary lipid oxidation product, peroxide value (PV), was investigated by the method of Chen, Muramoto, and Yamauchi (1995). The secondary lipid oxidation product, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), was measured according to Buege and Aust (1978). 2.5.2 Determination of heme iron and metmyoglobin contents The extractable heme iron content was determined as described by Benjakul and Bauer (2001). The metmyoglobin content was measured according to Hansen and Sereika (1969) by measuring the ratio of absorbance at 630 nm and absorbance at 525 nm. A high A630/A525 ratio represents a high content of metmyoglobin. 2.5.3 Determination of protein oxidation Natural actomyosin (NAM) was isolated from fish samples by the method of Benjakul, Seymour, Morrissey, and An (1997) and subjected to determinations of Ca2+-ATPase activity (Benjakul et al., 1997), free sulfhydryl (SH) content (Ellman, 1959), and protein carbonyl content (Liu et al., 2000)."
7,Physicochemical and textural analyses,"2.6 Physicochemical and textural analyses 2.6.1 pH measurement Ground fish (1 g) was homogenized with 10 mL of distilled water at 13,400 rpm for 1 min at room temperature (25–28 °C). The pH was then determined using a Cyberscan 500 pH meter. 2.6.2 Color determination The surface color (L*, a*, and b*) of the fish steaks was analyzed by a portable Hunterlab Miniscan/EX instrument (Hunter Assoc. Laboratory; VA, USA). Then, the total color difference value (ΔE) was calculated due to the differences between the color parameters of the samples and those of the control at Day 0 (Chaijan et al., 2020). ΔE = Δ L ∗ 2 + Δ a ∗ 2 + Δ b ∗ 2 2.6.3 Textural analysis A double compression test employing a TA-XT2i texture analyzer (Godalming, Surrey, UK) equipped with a spherical plunger (Ø = 5 mm/depression speed = 60 mm/min) was used to determine the hardness of the sea bass steaks (Chaijan et al., 2020). 2.6.4 Expressible moisture drip analysis A sliced sample (0.5-cm thick) was weighed and sandwiched between two layers of Whatman No. 1 filter paper on top and three layers of the same filter paper on the bottom. The standard weight (five kilograms) was placed on top of the sample and held for two minutes. After that, the sample was taken out and weighed again. The expressible moisture drip was allocated to the weight differential percentage (Chaijan et al., 2020)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Duncan's test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in means using SPSS Version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (p < 0.05). Data were presented as a mean ± standard deviation."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Changes in microbial qualities,"3.1 Changes in microbial qualities TVC, TPC, and PSC of Asian sea bass steaks treated with PAW at varied soaking times during storage are shown in Fig. 2a, b, and c, respectively. All samples had the same initial TVC (p > 0.05), which was in the range of 4.04–4.19 log CFU/g (p > 0.05), indicating that the microbiological quality of the fish was satisfactory. For meat and fish, there is typically no microbiological threshold; nonetheless, Thailand's government guidelines set a limit of roughly 7 log CFU/g for human consumption (Chaijan et al., 2020). Previously, the initial microbial contents of meat and seafood were recorded, and they varied depending on the species, post-harvest management, and freshness. The initial TVC of peeled brown shrimp and fresh rainbow trout was 5.4–6.4 log CFU/g (Calliauw et al., 2016) and 3–4 log CFU/g (Kakaei & Shahbazi, 2016). These initial TVC results were slightly lower than our earlier report, which stated that the TVC in whey protein-coated Asian sea bass steak ranged from 4.55 to 4.69 log CFU/g (Chaijan et al., 2020). The key families of fish spoilage bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae, have restricted growth below 7 °C (Gram & Dalgaard, 2002). Over the course of 30 days of cold storage, all samples showed an increase in TVC (p < 0.05). The control had a higher level of TVC than the PAW-treated fish steaks, suggesting PAW's efficiency in preventing microbial development. At Days 10 and 25, the TVC of the control and all PAW-treated samples exceeded the permissible limit of 7 log CFU/g (Chaijan et al., 2020), implying a 2.5-fold lower rate of microbial growth in PAW treatments compared to untreated samples (Fig. 2a). Herein, there was no significant difference in TVC among PAW-treated fish steaks (p > 0.05), implying that feeding gas type and PAW exposure period had similar effects on microbial inactivation. Throughout the 30 days of cold storage, the TPC values of all PAW-treated fish steaks were less than 7 log CFU/g (Fig. 2b), with the TPC of the control reaching the acceptable limit at Day 20. During the storage time, all treatments had a lower PSC than the permissible limit (Fig. 1c). According to the findings, a combination of PAW and cold storage can effectively inhibit the growth of psychrophilic bacteria in Asian sea bass steaks for up to 25 days by lowering the microbial proliferation rate. The bactericidal effects of PAW are caused by a mixture of primary and secondary reactive species created by plasma treatment of water, such as H2O2, singlet oxygen, superoxides, ozone, UV, excited ions, and electrons (Liao et al., 2017). PAW has three main inactivation mechanisms against microorganisms: (1) produce oxidative stress on cell membranes by ROS, (2) disrupt cell membrane integrity via the production of pores on the cell surface, and (3) create physical effects on cells via acidic pH, UV radiation, and shockwaves (Zhao, Patange, Sun, & Tiwari, 2020). According to Zhao et al. (2021), the bactericidal action of PAW can be explained in part by the synergistic effect of reactive species (H2O2, nitrate, nitrite, for example) and a significant acidity. The concentration of ROS has clearly contributed to the disinfection efficacy of PAW (Ma et al., 2016). When the exposure time was set at 10 min, 600 μM H2O2 was able to reduce Escherichia coli concentrations by approximately 3-log cycle (Hensel et al., 2015). This finding was consistent with Zhao et al. (2018), who reported a 3.1-log cycle reduction in bacteria on the surface of fresh beef treated with PAW for 24 h at Day 24 of storage. According to the findings, treating Asian sea bass steaks with PAW could potentially extend the cold storage shelf-life by delaying the growth of total microbial and psychrotrophic microorganisms."
11,Changes in off-flavor volatiles,"3.2 Changes in off-flavor volatiles During the spoilage of fish, several undesirable volatile compounds such as ketone, alcohol, dimethyl sulfide, dihydrogen sulfide, aldehydes, TMA, and organic acids are produced by chemical reactions and endogenous/microbial enzymes (Gram & Dalgaard, 2002). The TVB-N value can be used as a general measure of fish freshness (Mai & Huynh, 2017). During 30 days of cold storage, all samples had an increasing TVB-N value (Fig. 3a). In comparison to the PAW-treated fish steaks, the control had a higher rate of TVB-N accumulation (p < 0.05), which was exceeded the acceptable limit of 25 mg/100 g for good seafood quality around Day 10 (Gimenez, Roncales, & Beltran, 2002). There was no significant variation in TVB-N concentration between fish steaks treated with PAW created by both working gases with varied soaking periods over a time-course storage period (p > 0.05), indicating microbial inactivation was comparable. The strong link between microbial growth and the production of TVB-N in seafood is well documented (Kilincceker, Dogan, & Kucukoner, 2009). At Day 25, the TVB-N values of the fish steaks treated with all PAW systems, with the exception of the sample soaked in PAW produced by argon for 60 s, were higher than the acceptable limit (Fig. 3a). The decreased TVB-N contents of PAW-treated samples were due to increased microbial inactivation of reactive chemicals found in PAW, such as H2O2, ozone, nitrite, and free radicals. The microbial growth was substantially correlated with this result (Fig. 2a-c). TMA production is primarily linked to the generation of a fishy odor component caused by microbial modification of trimethylamine oxide (Günlü & Koyun, 2013). TMA is typically formed by bacteria such as Shewanella putrefaciens and Aeromonas spp. (Gram & Dalgaard, 2002). Fig. 3b shows the evolution of TMA content in fish steaks during cold storage. TMA development was not found in any of the treatments until Day 5, confirming the low fishy odor of the fish (Fig. 3b). When compared to the control, the control sample had a substantial increase in TMA content from Day 5 to the end, but all PAW treatments had a moderate increase in TMA creation (p < 0.05). The ultimate TMA level of the control sample was 965.96 nmol/g, whereas the final TMA contents of the PAW-dipped fish ranged from 211.44–477.28 nmol/g (Fig. 3b), suggesting the better ability of PAW treatment in controlling microbial growth and off-odor development of Asian sea bass steaks during storage. Fish steak treated with oxygen made PAW for 60–120 s had lower TMA content than fish steak treated with argon made PAW after a 25-day shelf-life. TMA restrictions have been imposed, such as 5–10 mg/100 g for sardines, despite the fact that no standard TMA limit has been established (Mohan, Ravishankar, Lalitha, & Gopal, 2012). From the results, TMA levels detected in all PAW-treated samples were less than 5 mg/100 g at all time points, indicating that TMA values were acceptable during the storage period. However, the TMA value in the control sample was greater than 5 mg/100 g on Day 30. The PAW exposure time had minimal effect on the development of TMA in fish steaks treated with PAW generated by the same feeding gas (Fig. 3b), which was consistent with the microbiological results (Fig. 2). The production of volatile aldehydes such as propanal is a key rancidity indicator of food lipid oxidation (Ross & Smith, 2006). The aldehydes also have a deleterious impact on human health (Chaijan et al., 2020). At the beginning of the storage period (Day 0), small quantities of propanal were found in all samples, indicating lipid oxidation during the production of fish steaks. Throughout the 30 days of cold storage, all PAW treatments showed a steady increase, if not a constant, in propanal accumulation (Fig. 3c). However, up to 20 days, a similar pattern was detected in the control sample, followed by a sudden increase in propanal, indicating the formation of oxidative off-flavor in the control fish steak at the late storage period. From Day 20 until the end of the storage period, the control steak had a greater propanal content than the PAW-treated steaks (p < 0.05). Throughout the storage period, the propanal content in all PAW treatments remained constant (p > 0.05). Surprisingly, the oxidative off-flavor development was lower in all PAW treatments than in the untreated sample. Because the fish steaks were dipped in PAW for such a short period of time, the buildup of ROS in the interior of the fish steaks may be low. The interaction of ROS with surface proteins may have resulted in the creation of a crust-like structure on the fish surface, resulting in the formation of an oxygen barrier. Because of the surface sealing effect, which limits oxygen diffusibility, the lipid autooxidation rate in fish meat is lower (see section 3.3.1). Furthermore, the low lipid content of Asian sea bass muscle may explain the low rate of lipid oxidation in PAW when activated by ROS. Certain nitrogenous species found in PAW, such as nitrate (NO3−) and nitrite (NO2−), may also act as supplementary antioxidants to prevent lipid autooxidation (Inguglia, Oliveira, Burgess, Kerry, & Tiwari, 2020). According to Inguglia et al. (2020), the lipid oxidation values of jerky prepared with plasma-activated brine (PAB) or normal immersion were equivalent. Similarly, when comparing PAW-processed ham to sodium nitrite-processed ham, there were no significant differences in lipid oxidation levels (Yong et al., 2018). As a result, in low fatty fish, using a high H2O2 concentration-PAW with a short contact time substantially reduced lipid oxidation-induced off-flavor development compared to untreated fish. The effect of PAW treatment on off-flavor development in dark-fleshed fatty fish like tuna and mackerel, on the other hand, is still a challenge."
12,Changes in chemical and biochemical properties,"3.3 Changes in chemical and biochemical properties 3.3.1 Lipid oxidation Because of the interaction of ROS with food lipids, lipid oxidation is one of the most significant effects that limits the use of PAW in food commodities. PV and TBARS values of the samples were analyzed during refrigerated storage to assess the influence of the PAW produced by two feeding gases with varying exposure times on the lipid oxidation of Asian sea bass steaks, and the findings are presented in Fig. 4a and b. Surprisingly, all PAW-treated samples had lowered PV and TBARS values after cold storage compared to the control sample (p < 0.05). The initial PV of all PAW-treated fish steaks was lower than the control (Fig. 4a), but there was no statistically significant difference in initial TBARS values between treatments (p > 0.05, Fig. 4b). This could be attributed to ROS-induced coagulation of surface proteins in PAW-treated fish steaks, and acid-induced protein denaturation could aid in the creation of crust skin-like surface. As a result, oxygen transport through the interior of fish was restricted. Other three hypotheses could account for the lower lipid oxidation in PAW-treated fish streaks in this investigation. The low lipid content in Asian sea bass steak could be linked to a lack of lipid substrate for lipid autooxidation to begin. Second, the brief PAW exposure to fish steaks may limit the amount of ROS that can reach the lipid components. Finally, the antioxidant properties of specific nitrogenous components (e.g., nitric oxide) found in PAW may have helped to reduce lipid oxidation in Asian sea bass steaks. However, increases in PV and TBARS levels were observed in all samples till Day 30 of cold storage, indicating that lipid oxidation had occurred progressively. Kim, Yong, Park, Choe, and Jo (2013) discovered that the production of free radicals during plasma treatment resulted in an increase in lipid oxidation in plasma-treated pork loin. As a result of the impact of free radicals, lipid oxidation in muscle foods increased after atmospheric pressure plasma treatment (Jayasena et al., 2015; Kim, Yong, et al., 2013). Furthermore, throughout 7 days of storage, the malondialdehyde (MDA) level of button mushrooms treated with PAW for 5, 10, and 15 min increased gradually, which was higher than the untreated sample (Xu et al., 2016). The key reason for the discrepancy between our results and those reported previously was the short PAW contact period (30–120 s), which resulted in reduced lipid oxidation. Zhao et al. (2018) discovered reduced lipid oxidation after 20 days of storage in beef treated with PAW for 24 h. In most foods, the TBARS rancidity threshold of 2–2.5 mg/kg was noticeable (Ripoll, Alcalde, Horcada, & Panea, 2011). Throughout the storage period, the TBARS values of all PAW-treated samples and the control did not approach the rancidity threshold, suggesting that fish flavor was acceptable. This was strongly supported by the propanal content (Fig. 3c). According to the findings, PAW treatment with a high H2O2 content and a short exposure duration is a potential technique for limiting lipid oxidation while also having a strong microbial inhibitory power. Overall, the fish steak treated with PAW generated by argon for 30 s exhibited the maximum lipid stability at a shelf-life of 25 days. 3.3.2 Heme iron content and myoglobin redox stability There was a difference in the initial heme iron content between treatments and controls (p < 0.05), implying that PAW treatment influenced heme iron degradation (Fig. 4c). The fish steak treated with oxygen created PAW for 120 s had the lowest initial heme iron level, followed by fish treated with argon made PAW for 120 s, and the control sample had the greatest initial heme iron content (p < 0.05). From the results, the longer PAW exposure duration had a greater impact on iron liberation from the heme structure than the feeding gas type. The H2O2 in PAW reacted with free ions released from either the heme or non-heme components to form OH ● via the Fenton reaction, according to Lee et al. (2018). The OH ● generated can lead to a chain reaction of free radical lipid autooxidation. The rate of lipid oxidation shown by PV (Fig. 4a) and TBARS (Fig. 4b) values of PAW-treated fish steaks, on the other hand, was lower than the control, which was inversely proportional to the reduced heme iron level in PAW treatments. The low myoglobin level of white muscle sea bass could be one of the reasons. Between PAW treatments and control, the released free iron equivalents with modest amounts from the heme porphyrin ring had no effect on lipid autooxidation. Furthermore, the presence of NO in PAW may quench the released free irons, rendering them inaccessible for lipid oxidation (Parthasarathy & Bryan, 2012). With increasing storage duration, all treatments showed a steady decrease in heme iron content, suggesting continuing non-heme iron liberation. As a result of the interaction of oxidants such as H2O2, free radicals, and ozone with heme iron complexes, were destroyed and free iron was released. Meat color is determined by the quantity of myoglobin and its redox forms (Chaijan & Panpipat, 2017). Fig. 4d shows the variations in metmyoglobin content in PAW-treated fish steaks. Over the course of 30 days of cold storage, the metmyoglobin concentration of all samples remained steady, indicating that myoglobin oxidation was similar. In comparison to the untreated solution, Cheng, Chen, and Sun (2021) discovered no significant difference in the structure and color of oxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin in the solution treated with cold plasma for less than 4 min. As a result, a short-term PAW treatment had little influence on myoglobin pigment. However, Zho et al. (2018) discovered that the oxidation of myoglobin by H2O2 in PAW caused a considerable rise in the relative fraction of metmyoglobin in 24-h PAW-treated fresh beef during storage. The discrepancy in our current investigation could be due to the fact that white fish muscle has less myoglobin than beef muscle, making it difficult to monitor the change of myoglobin to its oxidized form. 3.3.3 Protein oxidation As shown in Fig. 5 , the protein oxidation of PAW-treated Asian sea bass steaks was measured by decreases in Ca2+-ATPase activity and total free sulfhydryl content, as well as an increase in protein carbonyl content, during cold storage. Over storage periods, all treatments showed a steady drop in Ca2+-ATPase activity (Fig. 5a) and total free sulfhydryl content (Fig. 5b), confirming the denaturation and oxidation of muscle proteins. All samples had a gradual increase in protein carbonyl content during cold storage (Fig. 5c). The unfolding of protein, the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids, the loss of Ca2+-ATPase activity of the myosin head, and the oxidation of free sulfhydryl group (-SH) to form disulfide (SS) linkage were all possible causes. Protein oxidation was lower in the control sample than in the PAW-treated fish steaks (p < 0.05), as demonstrated by a lower protein carbonyl content and higher residual SH group and Ca2+-ATPase activity in the control sample. Backi (2018) reported an increase in carbonyl content in chicken breast treated with PAW when compared to an untreated sample. PAW thawed beef also had higher carbonyl and free SH concentrations than fresh beef (Liao et al., 2020). Because free SH can be generated as a result of protein unfolding, the net content of free SH in fish steaks could be linked to the rate of SH-containing amino acid exposure during PAW treatment and the rate of SH oxidation to form intra-molecular or inter-molecular SS bonds (Chizoba Ekezie, Cheng, & Sun, 2018). As a result, changes in free SH content may be seen over time in storage. Specifically, the strong oxidizing agent H2O2, which is produced by the reaction of radicals such as OH−, H2O+, and H+ with water, can convert SH groups into SS bonds and carboxyl groups into carbonyl groups, as well as render the Ca2+-ATPase inactive. Despite the fact that different feeding gases can produce different reactive species, the target reactive species H2O2 was discovered at the same concentration in this study. As a result, a consistent pattern of protein oxidation was identified across samples treated with PAW from diverse gases and contact times. When comparing secondary structures of NAM from king prawn (Litopenaeus vannamei) exposed to argon plasma for up to 3 min to untreated control, Chizoba Ekezie et al. (2018) found no significant differences, but after continuous argon plasma exposure beyond 3 min, a noticeable secondary structures change was observed. The short PAW contact time used in this investigation had a minor influence on protein unfolding in fish steaks, indicating that it was a viable technique for microbial suppression with minimal protein structural changes."
13,Changes in physicochemical and textural properties,"3.4 Changes in physicochemical and textural properties Chemical and biochemical reactions, as well as microbial growth, all contributed to changes in the physicochemical and textural properties of the fish during storage. The generation of basic compounds produced by the spoilage microorganism of the fish steaks during storage resulted in a small increase in pH in the control after cold storage (Fig. 6a). The pH shift correlated well with the TVB-N levels (Fig. 3a). Overall, the PAW-treated fish had a lower pH than the control, which resulted in more microbial inactivation over time. Jung et al. (2017) found that meat batter exposed to cold plasma discharge for 25 and 30 min had a lower pH than the untreated control. The acidification of PAW is also likely to cause the lower pH values of fish steaks treated with PAW compared to the control. During storage, no significant differences in pH alterations were identified between oxygen and argon-produced PAW-treated fish steaks with varying contact periods (p > 0.05). This was in line with Kang et al. (2019), who demonstrated no difference in pH values between fresh chicken breasts treated with PAW for 3–12 min. At day 30, the pH of the PAW-treated fish ranged from 6.34–6.80. (Fig. 6a). The buffering ability of muscle proteins may be linked to the small fluctuations in pH values in fish (Chaijan et al., 2020). Color is one of the most critical food quality features that influences a consumer's decision to buy a product (Nam & Ahn, 2002). Fig. 6b shows the surface total color change (ΔE) of fish steaks after PAW treatment. During the first 10 days of refrigerated storage, there was no significant difference in ΔE of all treatments (p > 0.05); however, after 10 days, ΔE of most of the PAW-treated fish steaks tended to increase quicker than the untreated fish sample (p < 0.05). ROS, reactive nitrogen species, and acidification in PAW (Yong et al., 2017) as well as the lipid oxidation products may have reacted with myoglobin or denatured the surface proteins, resulting in the discoloration of fish steaks. High concentrations of H2O2, nitrite (NO3−), and nitrate (NO2−) were found in PAW, according to Xiang et al. (2019), causing food color fading. The brightness of the chicken breasts was improved after treatment with alkaline and acidic electrolyzed water (Shimamura, Shinke, Hiraishi, Tsuchiya, & Masuda, 2016). Despite the fact that metmyoglobin tended to stay the same during storage (Fig. 4d), the ΔE rose (Fig. 4c). Other reactions, such as the Maillard reaction between the amine and carbonyl compounds contained in the fish, could have contributed to the discoloration of the fish steak. It should be noted that the fish steaks treated with oxygen created PAW for 90 s had similar ΔE to the control, with the exception of the end point, where the PAW treatment had a lower ΔE (Fig. 6b). It was unknown why this treatment had such minor color changes in comparison to other PAW treatments, although the discoloration of fish muscle caused by PAW treatment was complicated, including numerous chemical reactions. In PAW, the oxygenation of deoxymyoglobin to brilliant red oxymyoglobin can occur simultaneously with the oxidation of red oxymyoglobin to brown metmyoglobin, which is induced by ROS (Zhao et al., 2018). At the same time, the nitrogenous chemicals in PAW can be employed as a nitrite source for meat curing, resulting in pink nitrosylmyogobin production. Furthermore, changes in the light absorption and scattering by the fish surface were caused by the altered coagulation of surface muscle proteins caused by PAW acidification (Chaijan et al., 2020). As a result, the current discoloration of fish steaks may contribute to the net of all circumstances. Zhao et al. (2018) discovered that when chicken breasts were treated with PAW for 9 or 12 min, substantial increases in lightness values were detected, along with decreases in redness and yellowness values, indicating color fading. Changes in the textural property of fish steak as presented by breaking force are displayed in Fig. 6c. Up to day 20, all PAW treatments showed a gradual fall in hardness, with a quicker reduction in hardness observed until the end of storage (Fig. 6c), suggesting the loss of protein structural integrity. However, until 10 days of storage, there was no significant difference in hardness between the control and PAW-dipped sample (p > 0.05), after which there was a substantial drop in the hardness value of the control when compared to others (p < 0.05). This result could be linked to the action of bacteria, resulting in the softening of Asian sea bass steaks (Chaijan et al., 2020), especially in the control sample. The degree of muscle protein degradation by bacterial action may be the same in all samples during the first 10 days of storage (Fig. 2a-c), resulting in no significant difference in texture alteration in Asian sea bass steak. The structural instability of fish steaks could be explained by the rapid microbial development after 10 days. PAW treatment, regardless of gas type and contact time, may prevent microbial growth and inactivate endogenous/microbial proteolytic enzymes, resulting in less weakening of the muscle than the untreated sample. This finding was consistent with Zhao et al. (2018), who found that, over time, the PAW-treated fresh beef sample became softer than the untreated beef sample. The softening of fish texture may be explained by the loss of protein structural integrity induced by severe oxidative destruction of ROS and acidity of PAW (Zhao et al., 2018). The textural characteristic of meat is determined by its water holding capacity (WHC). During cold storage, all samples showed a decrease in WHC as described by high expressible moisture drip (Fig. 6d), which was likely due to the instability of protein-water interactions affected by ROS-induced protein denaturation. According to Ruiz-Cruz et al. (2019), oxidized lipids easily cross-link with muscle proteins, causing negative effects on protein solubility and WHC. Over the course of storage, oxygen created PAW-treated fish tended to have a higher expressible drip than argon made PAW- treated fish (Fig. 6d). Up to 15 days of storage, the expressible drip of fish steaks treated with PAW created by oxygen was greater than control, but after that, the expressible drip of control was higher than PAW treatment. The findings corroborated the toughness of fish steaks (Fig. 6c). Microorganism-induced protein structural disintegration may have contributed to the control fish steak's significant moisture loss over the last storage periods. According to the findings, the combined effects of microbial activity and ROS may have a role in the WHC of muscle proteins, which directly affects the texture of fish. The application of PAW produced by argon in Asian sea bass steaks had the superior protein integrity preservation effect regardless of contact time."
14,Conclusion,"The goal of this study was to test a new idea for preserving white fish muscle during cold storage by using PAW with a high H2O2 concentration and a short contact period. Treatment with PAW generated by oxygen and argon containing 100-ppm H2O2 for 30–120 s was able to keep the TVC below the acceptable limit for 25 days. The TVB-N, TMA, and propanal concentrations of PAW-treated fish were also lower than those of control fish. The PAW-dipped samples had lowered protein and lipid oxidation than the control, especially in PAW prepared with argon. When comparing PAW- treated samples to untreated samples, the textural preservation of PAW-treated samples with lesser expressible moisture drip was also noticeable. Overall, argon-produced PAW with 100-ppm H2O2 content and a short exposure time (30 s) is a potential preservation approach for preserving the quality and safety of Asian sea bass steaks during cold storage. However, further research is needed to apply this principle to dark muscular fish or other red meats."
