0,Introduction,"Liquid biofuels obtained from different types of biomasses are promising substitutes for fossil fuels used in the transportation sector, heating services and generation of electricity [1], in response to the global warming concerns. International policies, such as the Directive EU/2001/2018 targets for 2030, promote the increase in the use of sustainable biodiesel fuels [2]. Currently, commercial biofuels obtained from oleaginous plants, like biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) and renewable diesel (paraffins), are used [3]. The latter has competitive advantages over biodiesel, such as: a) better oxidative stability in storage, b) the oils used as raw materials for renewable diesel do not require a high degree of refining, while those for biodiesel do. c) renewable diesel may totally replace fossil diesel while biodiesel only partially, d) renewable diesel has a heating value of 46 MJ/kg, while that of biodiesel is 39 MJ/kg [4], e) the production process of renewable diesel does not yield glycerin as by-product, instead it produces propane that has a wider market, g) water is not used for the purification of renewable diesel. Current commercial technologies for the production of renewable diesel (Ecofining, NExBTL, H-BIO, Bio-Synfining) use two sequential stages [5]. First, a catalytic hydrotreating stage to obtain linear paraffins in a single reactor where the following reactions occur simultaneously: double-bond hydrogenation and deoxygenation comprising HDO (hydrodeoxygenation), DCO2 (decarboxylation) and DCO (decarbonylation) [6]. Second, a catalytic isomerization step to convert the linear paraffins into iso-paraffins. This stage is mainly done to improve the cold flow properties of the liquid biofuel. Pre-hydrogenation reaction refers to the saturation of double bonds of the triglycerides, which occurs without a strong dependence of the unsaturation percentage of the feedstock [5]. This reaction is conducted under milder conditions of temperature and pressure (150–250 °C and 10–100 bar) than those for deoxygenation reactions. It could improve the selectivity of the deoxygenation by avoiding collateral reactions over the double bonds such as polymerization, ring formation and aromatization. The products of these reactions, along with unsaturated species, are also responsible for the formation of coke deposits on the catalyst that deactivate it and lower its lifetime [7–11]. Pre-hydrogenation can also avoid thermal cracking that is favored by the presence of double bonds [12]. The patent of Jakkula et al. [10] reports the invention of a continuous reaction system for hydrotreating vegetable oils and animal fats, comprising a countercurrent pre-hydrogenation. When processing rapeseed oil, a final iodine value of 1–2 g I2/100 g of oil was achieved, employing Pd, Pt, Ni, Ni–Mo and Co–Mo catalysts supported on alumina and/or silica. It is suggested that the high percentage of saturation improves the final product yield, but this was not clearly reported neither discussed. In another patent by Jakkula et al. [13], previous to a HDO step, rapeseed oil was pre-hydrogenated in an autoclave at 250 °C and 30 bar, using alumina/silica supported Ni catalyst, obtaining a pre-hydrogenated product with an iodine number of 2 g I2/100 g of oil. For the hydro-deoxygenation step, Ni–Mo or Co–Mo catalyst were used. They claim that the yield of the final product (diesel) was also considerably improved by the pre-hydrogenation, but the specific increase was not reported; besides, no further exploration of deoxygenation reactions conditions (temperature, pressure, residence time) was performed. In the patent [14] Van Heuzen et al. converted palm oil into paraffinic hydrocarbons in a single catalyst bed of a NiO–W2O3 catalyst, at 60 bar and with a temperature gradient along the bed. At the top of the bed, the temperature was set at 320 °C, a lower level than that required for HDO reactions, and at the bottom, the temperature was set at 370 °C which is appropriate for the HDO reactions. This temperature profile created two reactions zones, one for pre-hydrogenation and a second one for deoxygenation. Although the yield and purity of hydrocarbons are not reported, they also obtained a high amount of branched paraffins (43.1 wt%). Likewise, Rozmysłowicz et al. [15] conducted pre-hydrogenation (at 120 °C) before deoxygenation experiments of tall oil fatty acids (at 300 °C) using a Pd/C catalyst and dodecane as a solvent. They remark the importance of pre-hydrogenating the feedstock for the suppression of undesired byproducts formation that occur under hydrogen scarce conditions. However, the final molar concentration of desired product (C17) did not surpass 24%, despite using a costly-noble metal catalysts, and the achieved hydrogenation percentages are not reported. By hydroprocessing crude palm oil with sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst in a trickled-bed reactor, Guzman et al. [16] obtained a high cetane index (96) renewable diesel, without pre-hydrogenation reactor. The reaction conditions were 40 bar of hydrogen pressure, 350 °C, LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) of 2 h−1 and a H2/oil molar ratio of 20, which is a common ratio found in the literature, yet far higher than the stoichiometric ratio for the hydrodeoxygenation mechanism (12–15 H2/oil). The product yield and purity were not reported, and hydrodeoxygenation was not fully reached due to the appearance of oxygenated intermediates, such as C16–C18 alcohols, C16–C18 acids and esters that were preliminary identified in the reaction product. They also reported that at pressures lower than 40 bar, a loss in the selectivity of diesel range (221–344 °C) products occurred. On the other hand, Srifa et al. [17] reported the catalytic hydrotreating of palm oil over NiMoS2/Al2O3, in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor, without pre-hydrogenation. They recommended, in order to obtain a product with n-alkane content >95.5% and yield of 90.0% (relative to the theoretical), the following reaction conditions: 300 °C, 30–50 bar, LHSV of 1–2 h−1, H2/oil molar ratio of 32–42. They concluded that the H2/oil molar ratio must be 3–5 times the theoretical ratio or higher, which is considerably high. Although the reaction conditions in this work were optimized, the increase of temperature from 330 to 420 °C resulted in the decrease in product yield from 88.9% to 37.9%, due to isomerization, cracking and cyclization reactions, as light-hydrocarbons, iso-paraffins, cycloparaffins and some aromatics were found in liquid product at this high temperature (420 °C). These results suggest that the side reactions could have been avoided or diminished by a pre-hydrogenation step. On the other hand, some other works that attempt the production of diesel-like fuels in continuous operation have not explored the pre-hydrogenation of the feedstock. That is the case of Liu et al. [18], who obtained BHD (bio-hydrogenated diesel) and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) from palm, jatropha and canola oil, in a one-step process (without pre-hydrogenation reactor). The process was conducted in a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor system at 350 °C, 4 MPa, a high H2/oil molar ratio of 34 and LHSV 7.6 h−1 with a sulfided Ni–Mo catalyst supported over SiO2–Al2O3. In the case of palm oil, the mass yield of BHD was 82.1%. Because palm oil contained a relatively large amount of C16-acids, the BHD product had a relatively low pour point (−15 °C) in comparison to those of jatropha and canola oils. Although they recognized that Ni–Mo/SiO2–Al2O3 has the trifunctional ability of hydrogenating, deoxygenating and isomerizating/cracking in a one-step hydrotreatment process, the pre-hydrogenation reaction was not explored in a separate reactor. Moreover, the effects of reactions parameters such as temperature, H2/oil ratio, LHSV and pressure were only studied for jatropha oil. Wang et al. [19] used a NiMoW/Al2O3– ZSM-5 catalyst to investigate the production of a biofuel from palm oil in a fixed-bed reactor, without pre-hydrogenation. Under the optimized reactions conditions (360 °C, 5 MPa, LHSV of 1.0 h−1, H2/oil volume ratio of 1000) the diesel yield was ca. 91% (relative to the theoretical), with good cold flow properties (cloud point −5 °C, distillation 268–350 °C). However, they encountered that a higher reaction temperature is adverse to obtain long chain alkanes, suggesting the need of a pre-hydrogenation step. In this work, palm oil was used as raw material because it is largely produced in Colombia. Although it is an edible oil, its current production is high enough to supply food (38%), biodiesel (56%) and soaps and animal food (6%) industries [20]. Also, a large amount of cheaper palm oil with high acid value is available and it is troublesome for food and biodiesel industries. Besides, palm oil is a medium-unsaturated oil (ca. 50%) that will require less intake of hydrogen for the hydrotreatment, in comparison with other widely used oils like rapeseed oil (ca. 90%). The use of commercial nickel/molybdenum catalyst has been reported for the production of renewable diesel by deoxygenation reactions. This catalyst was transferred from the petrochemical industry that mainly use it in HDS (hydrodesulfurization) and HDN (hydrodenitrogenation) reactions of petroleum fractions, and in a minor level in oxygen-removal reactions (HDO) because oxygen is not too abundant in petroleum [21–24]. From the above information, it is clear that the continuous deoxygenation of palm oil with a previous hydrogenation reaction has not been investigated. Such a process is very important because it could lead to a lower intake of hydrogen (not consumed in cracking reactions). The selectivity can also be increased because side reactions on the double bonds, such as polymerization, ring formation and aromatization are avoided. Pre-hydrogenation could also allow the reaction to be carried out at a higher temperature, therefore, the reaction rate is increased and this leads to the possibility of using a higher space velocity which means a lower loading of the expensive Ni–Mo catalyst. Last, but not less important, by avoiding the products of the side reactions, along with unsaturated species, which are responsible for the formation of coke deposits, the catalyst deactivation could be inhibited."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Palm oil was supplied by a local mill. Hydrogen (99.99%) and nitrogen (grade 5.0) gases were provided by Linde Group, Colombia. Katalco 61-1T (3.5% NiO and 10.5% MoO3) and HTC-Ni 600 1.2 RP (27% Ni) catalysts were obtained from Johnson Matthey. Elemental Sulfur (Merk, < 99%) and hexadecane (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%) were used in the reduction/sulfidation of Katalco 61-1T Catalyst. The method to measure the content of C9 to C24 hydrocarbons used: i) methyl stearate (Nu- Chek, >99%) as an internal standard (IS); ii) n-pentadecane-C15 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%), n-hexadecane-C16 (Alfa Assar, ≥99%), n-heptadecane-C17 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%) and n-octadecane-C18 (Alfa Assar, ≥99.5%), as reference standards of paraffins. Three reference gas standard mixtures, at different composition containing H2, O2, N2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and C3H8, were provided by Linde Group and were used to measure the gas phase composition of the hydrotreating experiments."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup used for the hydrotreating experiments. The system had an oil container, a high-pressure pump, a gas (H2 and N2) supply with pressure regulators, mass flow controllers, and a liquid-gas separator coupled to two gas-chromatographs. Reactions were carried out in this system comprising two continuous-flow fixed-bed reactors in series: pre-hydrogenation (PreH) and deoxygenation (DeoX) reactors. The PreH reactor had an ID of 1.0 cm and 4.5 cm of bed length. The DeoX reactor had an ID of 0.9 cm, and 9 cm of bed length. The amount of catalyst in the PreH reactor was 3 g, corresponding to LHSV of 2 h−1, while in the DeoX reactor was either 2 g or 4 g, corresponding to LHSV of 3.3 h−1 and 1.6 h−1, respectively. After loading the catalyst, a purge with N2 was done, and the oil was pre-heated at 40 °C to aid its pumping. According to the literature [13], pre-hydrogenation pressure can vary between 10 and 100 bar, and the HDO pressure between 20 and 150 bar. Besides, from previous assays at 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 MPa the purity of DLB (diesel-like biofuel) started to significantly decay below 3 MPa and was almost stable at higher pressures. Therefore, the hydrogen working pressure was set at 3 MPa by a back pressure regulator valve, and the temperature was raised to the set point value. A stabilization period of 2 h was allowed before taking the liquid and gas samples. Two operation modes of both reactors (PreH and DeoX) were used. When the PreH reactor is ON it means that the oil was first pre-hydrogenated, with the H2:oil molar ratio of 9, and subsequently deoxygenated. When the PreH reactor is OFF it means that the oil was not pre-hydrogenated but directly deoxygenated. A set of experiments was conducted by varying temperature, LHSV, and reactor’s mode, according to the Table 1 ."
4,Liquid product characterization,"2.3 Liquid product characterization DLB was defined as the mixture of linear and isomer hydrocarbons between C9 and C24. The hydrocarbon content of the liquid products was determined by chromatography. A chromatograph Agilent 7890A was used, which was equipped with FID (flame ionization detector) and DB-5HT capillary column (Agilent J&W). The chromatograph conditions were: injection port at 250 °C with flow of 124.5 mL/min; initial temperature of oven at 60 °C for 2 min; afterwards, temperature was increased to 200 °C at 10 °C/min; then, the final temperature of 250 °C was reached at 5 °C/min. The flow through the column was 0.6 mL/min; the FID was at 300 °C, with a hydrogen and airflow of 30 mL/min and 400 mL/min, respectively. The method included methyl stearate as an IS (internal standard) with the RPs (reference paraffin standards) such as C15, C16, C17 y C18. From this IS it was stablished a response factor of 0.8 to the different RPs. This IS was used because it did not overlap with any paraffin in the chromatographic method (GC-FID method). The RPs were evaluated for triplicate and the repeatability was ±1.5%. A gas chromatograph with mass detector (GC-MS AGILENT 5975C), operated at similar conditions than the before GC-FID method, was also employed to identify linear and branched hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, aromatics, di-esters, among other heavy molecules. These compounds presented very small chromatographic areas with GC-MS, suggesting low concentration in the product. Palm oil and reaction products were also characterized by Iodine value (ISO 3961), saponification value (ISO 3657), acid value (ISO 660) and fatty acids composition (ISO 5508 and ISO 5509). The DLB purity, DLB yield, and Palm oil conversion were calculated as follows: DLB Purity = grams of C 9 − C 24 hydrocarbons grams of liquid product DLB Yield = ( hydrocarbon content ) x ( grams of liquid product ) ( grams of fed palm oil ) x 100 Palm oil Conversion = [ ( equivalent mg KOH of fed palm oil ) − ( equivalent mg KOH of liquid product ) ] ( equivalent mg KOH of fed palm oil ) x 100"
5,Gas phase characterization,"2.4 Gas phase characterization A chromatographic method was developed to quantify the following gases: H2, O2, N2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and C3H8. This method used a chromatograph Agilent 7890B, equipped with TCD (thermal conductivity detector) and two capillary columns coupled in series: GS-CarbonPLOT (Agilent J&W) and HP-PLOT Molesieve (Agilent J&W). Three RGs (reference gas standard mixtures), at different composition containing the above-mentioned gases were used for quantification. The RGs were evaluated for triplicate and the repeatability was ±2.0%."
6,Catalysts conditioning and characterization,"2.5 Catalysts conditioning and characterization 3 g of catalyst HTC-Ni 600 catalyst were crushed and sieved to 0.2–0.5 mm, and then used in the PreH without further treatment. Katalco 61-1T catalyst was reduced and sulfided (Katalco 61-1TSx) in a high-pressure batch reactor (Parr Instruments) following a procedure disclosed in our previous work [25]. Once treated, the Katalco 61-1TSx catalyst was crushed and sieved to 0.2–0.5 mm and stored in the solvent. Before characterization, the Katalco 61-1TSx catalyst was washed with dichloromethane, and the residual solvent was removed under nitrogen flow. HTC-Ni 600 and Katalco 61-1TSx catalysts were characterized by TPO (temperature programmed oxidation) using an Autochem II 2920 equipment. The method consisted in heating the sample in a quartz tube, from 100 °C to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, under an O2/Ar (5% O2) flow of 50 mL/min, and a TCD measured the intake of oxygen. The resulting gases from the TPO experiments were identified by coupling a quadrupole mass spectrometer OmniStar GSD-320-O in series. UHV-XPS analyses were carried out for both catalysts in a Specs brand X-ray photoelectronic spectrometer (NAP-XPS) with a PHOIBOS 150 1D-DLD analyzer, using a monochromatic source of Al-Kα (1486.7 eV, 13 kV, 100 W) with step energy of 90eV for general spectra and 20eV for high-resolution spectra. The step was 1 eV for the general spectra and 0.1 eV for the high resolution spectra. 20 measurement cycles were performed for the high resolution spectra and 5 cycles for the general spectra."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Palm oil characterization,"3.1 Palm oil characterization Table 2 summarizes the quality parameters determined for the palm oil used, such as acidity, saponification, iodine value and fatty acids composition. All reported values are within the range of those for a high quality refined palm oil."
9,Catalyst conditioning and characterization,"3.2 Catalyst conditioning and characterization The TPO allows determining the oxygen intake in the oxidation reaction of reduced and sulfided species during a temperature ramp. HTC-Ni 600 (see Fig. 2 a) has three oxidation peaks for Ni0, derived from the diverse level of nickel interaction with the support, being the small clusters the most active [26,27]. First signal at 203 °C corresponds to small nickel clusters (S) derived from amorphous NiO. Second signal at 382 °C is due to medium size clusters (M) derived from crystalline NiO, and third signal at 568 °C corresponds to the big Ni clusters or particles (B) derived from the compound NiAl2O3. All particles are active sites for triglyceride hydrogenation and, according to the TPO spectra, their amount decreases in the order S > M > B [28–31]. In summary, this analysis shows that in the Ni catalyst all the metal is in its reduced state and in three different types of cluster. TPO of Katalco 61-1TSx (reduced and sulfided Ni–Mo) is presented together with the 64 amu-mass spectrum attributed to sulfur dioxide species (see Fig. 2b), in order to follow up the SO2 release from the oxidation process, allowing to distinguish when an oxidation peak in the katalco 61-1TSx catalyst corresponds to sulfided species and residual elemental sulfur S8 or to reduced metal species. TPO signal shows six O2 consumption signals. The shoulder at 130 °C corresponds to oxidation of elemental S8. The band centered at 155 °C (between 130 and 200 °C) indicates that reduced metal species are also present because there is a high oxygen consumption without appreciable production of SO2, this also happened in the signal centered at 358 °C (between 300 and 420 °C). The signal at 218 °C (between 150 and 300 °C) corresponds to MoSx oxidation to MoO with the equivalent production of SO2. In the signal at 421 °C (between 300 and 550 °C), Ni-MoSx species were oxidized to NiO and MoO with an equivalent production of SO2, indicating that active-sulfided sites are still present in the catalyst even at the higher reaction temperature of 380 °C. The broad and small signal at 590 °C (between 550 and 750 °C) is completely due to reduced metal species because no SO2 was produced. In summary, these analyses indicate that the sulfided Ni–Mo catalyst has mainly sulfided MoSx and Ni-MoSx, but also appreciable amounts of reduced metal species, and that the sulfided species are stable up to 500 °C. We have already reported elsewhere additional catalyst characterization [60] and these are the more relevant issues. Katalco 61-1T has a surface area (BET) 248 m2/g, pore volume 0,67 cm3/g, pore size 8,3 nm and is composed of 13.9% MoO3, 5.5% NiO, 9.6% SO3 and 69.9% Al2O3 (determined by XRF). XRD patterns showed the main diffraction peaks of cubic γ-alumina at 46° y 67° (JCPDS 10–425), the orthorhombic MoO3 phase was not observed (signal at 27.3°), indicating that Mo was highly dispersed and/or completely sulphided, signals due to hexagonal MoS2 were also observed. Ni2S3 and NiO signals were not observed, indicating a high dispersion. HTC 600 has a surface area (BET) of 165.9 m2/g, pore volume of 0.38 cm3/g, pore size of 9.18 nm and is composed of 63.4% Al2O3 y 36.6% NiO. Nickel in Katalco 61T (Fig. 3 a), reduced and sulphided, showed in XPS spectrum (845–880 ev) a multiplet structure allowing variation of the multiplet spacings. The observed binding energies (BE) for Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 in the Katalco 61T catalyst are approximately 854.2 eV and 872.8 eV, respectively, both being ascribed to Ni2+ species associated with NiMoS4 and NiAl2S4 from NiMoO4 and NiAl2O4 sulphided species, respectively [32]. The presence of a peak below 848.8 eV and 868.5 eV shows a NixSy phase, which might be NiS, Ni2S3, or Ni9S8, is formed during sulfidation. Molybdenum XPS species on Katalco 61T are presented in Fig. 3b. The decomposition of Mo3d spectra shows that molybdenum is present in two states with binding energies attributed to Mo4+ species in MoS2 phase (BE 228.1 eV) [33,34] and Mo6+ species in MoO3 (BE 232.2 eV). Fig. 3b reveals also S2s photopeak at 226.1 eV attributed to S2− in the sulfide species. In the S2p spectra (Fig. 3c), sulfur is predominantly present in the state with BE of 162.5 eV, attributed to S2− in the molybdenum disulfide. The signal from S2p with BE of 169.1 eV, characteristic of sulfur in the SO4 2− species [35–37] is practically absent. XPS results of HTC 600 show a similar multiplet nickel structure, Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 at 853.9 ev and 872.1 ev, respectively (Fig. 3c). In HTC the Ni2+ species are associated to remanent NiO [38] and metallic Ni [39]. Auger lines Ni-LMM (Fig. 3f) were associated with metallic nickel in clusters [40]. Alumina interactions can be localized between 90.0 ev and 55.0 ev. Al2O3 with BE of 75 eV (due to Al2p3/2-1/2) and Ni2Al3 with BE of 68 eV (due to Ni3p3/2-1/2) signals are present (Fig. 3e) [39]."
10,Hydrotreating experiments,"3.3 Hydrotreating experiments After screening several conditions, experiments of palm oil hydrogenation were conducted only with PreH (DeoX was OFF) loaded with the HTC Ni-600 catalyst, at 250 °C (to reach an acceptable hydrogenation of dimer and trimer fatty acids [41,42]), LHSV = 2 h−1, H2/oil molar ratio of 9 and 3 MPa of pressure. Almost complete hydrogenation of palm oil was obtained (98.8% conversion), calculated from the initial iodine value of the palm oil (58.72 g I2/100 g) and the final iodine value in the hydrogenated oil (<1.0 g I2/100 g). Therefore, these pre-hydrogenation conditions were maintained for the rest of the experiments. The hydrotreating process was done at an overall H2/oil molar ratio of 9 by considering the following facts: i) The complete saturation of double bonds in palm oil requires a theoretical H2/oil molar ratio of 2. Therefore a H2/oil molar ratio of 9 assures enough hydrogen for the pre-hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions. ii) Taking into account the amount of double bonds (from the iodine value) and fatty acids composition of palm oil (see Table 2), the theoretical H2/oil molar ratio for HDO, DCO2 and DCO reactions are 14, 5 and 8, respectively [43–45], and they include the intake of hydrogen for the saturation of the triglyceride (2 mol) and hydrogenolysis (3 mol). iii) A 100% contribution of each separate reaction route, HDO, DCO2 and DCO, leads to DLB theoretical maximum yield of 85.2, 80.2 and 80.2%, respectively. Therefore, it is possible to lower the hydrotreating overall H2/oil molar ratio below 14, favoring the DCO2/DCO routes without compromising the yield considerably. Besides, H2/oil molar ratios below 10 have been reported for the production of diesel-like fuels from vegetable oils with promising results [16,46]. Table 3 shows that liquid products obtained when the PreH reactor is Off have the worst quality parameters with all the temperatures and LHSV investigated. With the PreH reactor On, best results were obtained at the lowest temperature, although results at the highest temperature are also good enough. Because of its lowest acid and saponification values, as well as the highest DLB purity, the experiment 3 would better fulfill the quality standards among the experiments with PreH On, therefore it was chosen for further fuel-characterization."
11,Effects of the pre-hydrogenation stage on the diesel-like biofuel yield and the oil conversion,"3.4 Effects of the pre-hydrogenation stage on the diesel-like biofuel yield and the oil conversion Fig. 4 shows that when the PreH is operating (on), the oil conversion is almost complete and stable with the temperature and the LHSV. However, when this reactor is not operating (off) and at the highest LHSV (3.3 h-1) the oil conversion is very low at 350 °C but sharply increases with temperature, while at the lowest LHSV (1.6 h-1) the conversion is complete and stable at both temperatures. This indicates that when the PreH reactor is off, the reaction time in the deoxygenation reactor is used for both the hydrogenation and the deoxygenation reactions and that is why at the lowest reaction time (highest LSHV) a higher reaction rate, caused by a higher temperature, is required to assure complete conversion. Fig. 4 also shows that the pre-hydrogenation step leads to almost the theoretical yield (80.2%) for the DCO2/DCO reaction pathway (that will be explained later) at all the experimental conditions, with the exception of the experiment at the highest temperature (380 °C) and the lowest LHSV (1.6 h-1) that shows a decreased yield due to side reactions (conversion was almost complete). On the other hand, when the pre-hydrogenation step was not running, the yield was remarkably affected by temperature and LHSV. At the highest LHSV (3.3 h−1), the yield was very low at 350 °C and considerably increased by increasing temperature but still it was low, these low yields are mainly due to the low oil conversions caused by the short reaction time. At the lowest LHSV (1.6 h−1), the yield was higher and stable with temperature but lower than theoretical value. In this latter case the lower yields are due to a lower selectivity because the oil conversions were almost complete. All these observations indicate that the pre-hydrogenation enables the use of higher LHSV without losing conversion nor yield. This means that for a fix throughput, less deoxygenation catalyst can be used, and this catalyst is more expensive than the hydrogenation catalyst. There is also clear evidence that the yield is decreased, at all experimental conditions evaluated, when pre-hydrogenation is not done, most probably to side reactions. Results on composition of liquid products, shown in Fig. 5 , support the above discussion. Without pre-hydrogenations and at high LHSV a lot of saponifiable matter was present, indicating low conversion of the glycerides, this low conversion was partially improved by temperature. The fraction “Others” was in larger amounts when pre-hydrogenation was not done and its concentration increased with temperature, this indicates that this fraction is probably due to side reactions on the double bonds leading to oligomers. Another important observation is that the higher concentration of C15 and C17, compared to C16 and C18; indicate that the pathways DCO/DCO2 were predominant [47–51]. The composition of the gas products, shown in Fig. 6 , helps to better understand the results. CO2 is the most abundant in all the experiments, therefore the DCO2 pathway was predominant. CO was also present in lower concentrations but its concentration increases without pre-hydrogenating. Methane was produced in important amounts, but its concentration was higher in the experiments with pre-hydrogenations. This methane must be produced in the deoxygenation reactor by hydro-cracking of propane. As expected, propane was produced from the glycerol moiety. A considerable amount of ethane, and a very small amount of ethylene, were produced confirming the occurrences of propane cracking."
12,Determination of deoxygenation reaction pathway of palm oil,"3.5 Determination of deoxygenation reaction pathway of palm oil Based on the literature [43–45], Fig. 7 displays a theoretical reaction pathway for the conversion of palm oil into DLB. Due to the fact that the HDO route does not remove carbon atoms from the fatty acids while the DCO2 and DCO routes do remove one carbon atom from each fatty acid molecule, the contribution of the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) pathway was calculated from the ratio of even-carbon molecules to odd-carbon molecules in the liquid product. Besides, the separate contributions of DCO2 and DCO reactions were calculated from the ratio of CO2/CO in the gas product. Based on the composition of even and odd hydrocarbons in the liquid product of experiment 3, the contribution of the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction was 19.2%, and the contribution of both decarboxylation (DCO2) and decarbonylation (DCO) reactions was 80.8%. Therefore, a maximal theoretical yield of 81.2% for experiment 3 was estimated, corresponding to a relative yield of 99.8%. Considering that water gas shift, reverse water gas shift and methanation reactions were negligible, the separate contributions of DCO2 and DCO reactions were calculated from the ratio of CO2/CO in the gas product (6), resulting in 69.26% and 11.54%, respectively. Therefore, the main reaction pathway is the decarboxylation. These results are important because, from the economical point of view, this route requires less intake of hydrogen, around a half less compared with the HDO route (see Fig. 7), and involves the use of simple catalysts [44]. Besides, the water produced by the HDO route can reduce in one-third the catalyst activity [52], therefore, it is expected that the catalyst through the process of the present work will last more."
13,DLB properties,"3.6 DLB properties Because of its lowest acid and saponification values, as well as the highest DLB purity, the experiment 3 would better fulfill the quality standards among the experiments with PreH On, therefore it was chosen for further fuel-characterization. The selected DLB (experiment 3) was characterized according to key parameters with ASTM and ISO methods, and was compared with quality parameters of palm oil biodiesel and a petrochemical diesel (Table 4 ). DLB has a higher heating value than biodiesel, owing to nearly total elimination of oxygen, and is similar to the one for petrochemical diesel. This high energy content per unit of mass compensates its lower density on volumetric fuel delivery scale, avoiding the need of more fuel mass to provide the same energy input per each engine cycle [53]. The density of DLB of 0.786 g/mL is expected, based on our previously reported results of palm oil renewable diesel [47], fulfilling the EN 15940 standard. Although density and viscosity are 8.6% and 27.6% smaller with respect to petrochemical diesel, these variations do not represent a restriction for blending HVO with diesel fuel. On the contrary, the reductions in density associated with HVO blending would enable the use of heavier (and generally denser) oil distillation fractions and/or the use of ternary blends HVO/biodiesel/diesel, while keeping the density within the limits established in the standards. This would provide an economic saving to refineries and inclusion of renewable fraction in automotive fuels [54]. The cetane index of 93.2 is comparable with the product of Honeywell UOP (70–90) [56], this value is higher than the one for diesel and biodiesel, which is a very well-known issue [57] that would limit the use of DLB in non-modified diesel engines, due to a quicker ignition, with respect to the optimized control of the engine. This affects engine emissions, efficiency and thermal and mechanical loads in the piston and cylinder head, but can be solved by adjusting the electronic control of the engine [54]. With this modifications a cleaner combustion may be achieved, thanks to the high cetane number and low C/H ratio, while avoiding deposits in the crankcase, and preventing engine oil from rapid aging [53]. The Copper Strip Corrosion Test indicated a level of corrosion 1A (slight tamish) for all fuels tested in Table 4, which is an acceptable level. From the distillation and composition results of diesel-like, is expected that the deposits and soot formation is reduced by a less contribution of heavy compounds [58]. Cold flow properties of DLB, such as cloud point and pour point, were as expected, since it is a non-isomerized renewable diesel. It was comparable with the reported by Liu et al. [18], who obtained a liquid hydrocarbon product from jatropha oil in a continuous reactor over NiMo/SiO2 with long normal hydrocarbons of high melting points, thus giving high pour point of 20 °C. Likewise, these properties are similar to biodiesel, so its limitation for being used in cold weather remains, leading to the need of an isomerization step, or blend it with 20% of diesel to achieve a pour point < -1 °C [59], thus fulfilling standards."
14,Conclusions,"The pre-hydrogenation of palm oil, followed by the deoxygenation, enabled the use of higher LHSV and temperature without losing conversion nor yield and this means that for a fix throughput, less deoxygenation catalyst can be used. When pre-hydrogenation was not done, the yield was decreased at all experimental conditions evaluated, due to side reactions on the double bonds. This two-staged process is very important because it could lead to a lower intake of hydrogen (not consumed in cracking reactions). The selectivity can also be increased because side reactions on the double bonds such as polymerization, ring formation and aromatization are avoided. Pre-hydrogenation could also allow the reaction to be carried out at a higher temperature, therefore, the reaction rate is increased and this leads to the possibility of using a higher space velocity which means a lower loading of the expensive Ni–Mo catalyst. The decarboxylation route was predominant (69,3%) followed by the decarbonylation (11,5%) and the hydrodeoxygenation routes (19.2%). The product had properties similar or superior to those of fossil diesel and biodiesel, with the exception of cold flow properties that were worse than those of fossil diesel but very similar to those of biodiesel requiring blends with fossil diesel to fulfill standards."
