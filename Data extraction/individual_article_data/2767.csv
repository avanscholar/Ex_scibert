0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, due to its high energy density and no carbon dioxide emissions, is a potential candidate to solve the future low-carbon energy demands, and electrochemical water splitting is an attractive and sustainable hydrogen production method for its environmental friendliness, low energy consumption and high product purity [1–4]. However, the key requirement of this method is to develop an efficient, stable and low-cost catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [5–7]. So far, the most effective HER electrocatalysts are still Pt-based materials, but the high cost and scarcity of Pt severely limit its industrial application [8–10]. In order to find better alternatives, earth-abundant transition metals have received a lot of attention in recent years. However, the catalytic activity of transition metal-based catalysts is still unsatisfactory, and most of them only show the best performance in acidic media [11–15]. Besides, many commercial water electrolyzers operate in alkaline conditions, so it is very important to develop HER catalysts with excellent performance in alkaline media [16]. Many efforts have been made to increase the number of exposed active sites and the activity of each active site of catalysts, as they are two important strategies to improve performance for HER [17]. Nanoscale metals on heteroatoms (N, P) doped carbon materials are widely utilized as HER catalysts with better performance due to the large number of optimized catalytic sites and the high conductivity of carbon materials [18–22]. In order to improve the activity of the catalytic sites, optimizing the electronic structure of the catalyst and reducing the Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption are the basic methods. In this way, the transfer of electrons and protons can be accelerated, and hydrogen can be released quickly [23]. In recent years, multi-metallic composite materials have also received extensive attention from researchers, and many multi-metallic (Ni, Co, Al, Pb, Mn and precious metals, etc.) electrocatalysts with good HER catalytic performance have been developed [24–33]. However, a simple preparation process and high performance at alkaline conditions are still the main problems in the development of catalysts for industrial applications. In this work, we developed a fragment-interconnected N-doped porous carbon nanosheets loaded with platinum group metal (Pd, Pt or Ru), with a simple preparation process and good HER performance in alkaline solution. Our work mainly includes three steps: (1) Preparing interconnected porous carbon nanosheets (PCN) by one-step pyrolysis method, (2) Melamine is introduced and pyrolyzed to form N-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCN), (3) The Pd/Pt/Ru metal precursors are confined on the porous carbon nanosheets and reduced to be metals in situ. The prepared Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN catalysts have metal content of about 10 wt%, while exhibiting outstanding HER catalytic activity and good stability in 1.0 M KOH. The low overpotentials and small Tafel slopes are all superior to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Especially, due to the synergistic effect of uniformly distributed small size Pd nanoparticles (average diameter: 1.75 nm) and N-doped carrier, the introduction of melamine has the most significant improvement on the catalytic activity of Pd-loaded porous carbon nanosheets. At the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, the overpotential is significantly reduced from 98 mV of Pd-PCN to 21 mV of Pd-NPCN."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Palladium (II) chloride (PdCl2), Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), Ruthenium (III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O) and potassium citrate were purchased from Macklin. Melamine was purchased from Aladdin. Potassium hydroxide (KOH), sulfuric acid (98% H2SO4) and ethyl alcohol (EtOH, 99.5%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on carbon-black) and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar."
3,Preparation of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN,"2.2 Preparation of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN First, 3 g of potassium citrate was pyrolyzed in a tube furnace at 800 °C in Ar for 1 h. After the black product was collected, it was washed successively in HCL (10%), H2SO4 (0.5 M) and ultrapure water to remove inorganic impurities. After drying, PCN was obtained. Then, 50 mg PCN was mixed with 150 mg melamine with grinding (mass ratio: 1/3). Then, the mixture was pyrolyzed in Ar at 800 °C in a tube furnace for 2 h and the black powder obtained was NPCN. Subsequently, 40 mg NPCN was dissolved in 9.26 ml ultrapure water. After stirring for a few minutes, 1.37 ml of PdCl2 acid solution (30 mg mL−1) and 1.37 ml of KOH (1.0 M) were added. Stirring was continued overnight at 70 °C. After centrifugation, the product was washed several times with ethanol and dried in vacuum, and then heated in a tube furnace at 200 °C in 5% H2/Ar for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, Pd-NPCN was obtained. For Pt-NPCN, 40 mg of NPCN should be dissolved in 8 ml of ultrapure water, and then 4 ml of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution (32.8 mg ml−1) was added. Finally, it was heated in a tube furnace at 400 °C in 5% H2/Ar for 2 h, and all other steps were the same as Pd-NPCN. For Ru-NPCN, 40 mg of NPCN should be dissolved in 10.4 ml ultrapure water, and then 1.6 ml RuCl3·xH2O aqueous solution (38 mg ml−1) was added. Finally, it was heated in a tube furnace at 125 °C in 5% H2/Ar for 2 h, and all other steps were the same as Pd-NPCN. In the preparation of Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN, except for using PCN instead of NPCN, the other preparation processes remain the same."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded at 5 kv on a Zeiss LEO-1530 electron microscope. Transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were measured on an FEL Talos-F200S electron microscope with Super X-EDS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was tested on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe Ⅱ spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Bruker D2 PHASER diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The Raman scattering measurement was performed under a multi-module Raman system with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and a confocal microscope at room temperature. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface area was obtained from the N2 adsorption isotherm (77.3 K) measurement of a Quadrasorb 2QDS-30 specific surface analyzer. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) measurement was performed on an Agilent 730 spectrometer."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were performed on an analytical electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode system. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE, filled with saturated KCl solution, with equilibrium potential of 0.241 V vs. RHE) and Hg/HgO electrode (filled with 1.0 M KOH, with equilibrium potential of 0.9254 V vs. RHE) were used as reference electrodes (RE) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. In order to avoid the influence of Pt deposition on HER, graphite rods were selected as the counter electrode (CE) in all electrochemical tests. The working electrode (WE) was an l-shaped glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter). The preparation steps of the working electrode were as follows: 3 mg of catalyst sample was ultrasonically dispersed in a mixed solution of 480 μL of ethanol and 20 μL of Nafion. Subsequently, 10 μL of the mixed solution was dropped onto the GCE four times and dried naturally at room temperature. The catalyst loading on each GCE is 848 μg cm−2. The polarization curves of Pd/Pt-NPCN and Pd/Pt-PCN under alkaline and acidic conditions were all measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, while the polarization curves of Ru-NPCN and Ru-PCN were measured at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 due to the presence of charging current. All potentials were calibrated to potentials vs. RHE and all polarization curves had 90% IR-compensation (the corresponding Rs values are shown in Table S3 and Table S4). The Tafel slopes were obtained by the equation: η = a + blog(j), which also reflects the charge transfer kinetics of HER (where b is the Tafel slope, η is the overpotential and j is the current density) [13,14]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at 0.02 V vs. RHE with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values were calculated from the results of the cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests, which were performed in the voltage range of 0.05 to 0.15 V vs. RHE with scan rates of 20 to 100 mV s−1. In order to ensure the comparability between different samples, the CV stability tests were carried out under different voltage ranges corresponding to the current density of 0–100 mA cm−2 when each sample was working. The time stability was measured at a constant current density of 30 mA cm−2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Preparation and structure characterization,"3.1 Preparation and structure characterization The main preparation processes of Pd/Pt-Ru-PCN and Pd/Pt-Ru-NPCN are summarized in Fig. 1 a. PCN was prepared by pyrolysis of potassium citrate based on the reported method with some modification [34]. The prepared PCN was firstly ground and mixed with melamine with a mass ratio of 1:3, the mixed powder was subsequently pyrolyzed in a tube furnace for 2 h with 100 ml/min Ar flow. In the process of high-temperature pyrolysis, melamine was decomposed into carbon–nitrogen species (CNx) at a temperature higher than 600 °C. Subsequently, the CNx species were anchored to the surface of the porous carbon under high temperature conditions. The presence of excess CNx inhibited the formation of bubbling morphologies on the porous carbon surface, and also prevented the aggregation and deformation of porous carbon at high temperatures. Here, the pyrolyzed melamine not only provided a nitrogen source, but also acted as a protective agent. The fragment-interconnected N-doped porous carbon with smooth surface formed in this way provides more anchoring sites for subsequent metal reduction and loading. In the next step, the precursors of Pd, Pt and Ru metals were introduced into the N-doped porous carbon carriers and reduced to be Pd, Pt, Ru metals in situ. The reduction process includes the self-reduction of the precursors on the N-doped carbon in the solution and the further annealing in 5% H2/Ar flow. In the end, the target catalysts Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN were successfully synthesized. The microstructure and surface morphology of PCN and NPCN were characterized by SEM, shown in Fig. 1(b-d). PCN without the introduction of melamine exhibits a staggered structure of small carbon nanosheets, and a bubble-like morphology can be seen on the surface of some nanosheets, which have been marked in red circles. Compared with PCN, NPCN doped with nitrogen at 800 °C presents a fragment-interconnected porous structure, and all nanosheets have a smooth surface. Such morphological differences can also be observed in the SEM images of Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN, as shown in Fig. S1(d-i). For better comparison, we prepared a sample 800 °C-PCN which was not mixed with melamine but also annealed at 800 °C for 2 h, as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S1b. It can be seen that the porous carbon has obvious aggregation, and the bubbling morphology on the surface is more obvious. These results prove that the introduction of melamine is the key to improving the surface morphology of porous carbon while doping with nitrogen, which is beneficial to the loading of metal particles during the reduction process. TEM results present the microstructure of loaded metal particles on N-doped porous carbon. It can be seen from Fig. 2 a that Pd nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on NPCN with a small average diameter of 1.75 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2d) further shows the lattice fringes with a pitch of 0.09773 nm, which correspond to the (400) crystal plane of Pd. It can be seen from Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, part of Pt and Ru are aggregated to be larger particles than Pd, which scale is from 4 to 11 nm. The aggregation would decrease the contact rate between metal particles and the N-doped sites of the porous carbon. From the embedded particle size distribution diagram, it can be seen that the largest proportion of Pt particle size is 1.1–2.1 nm, and the largest proportion of Ru particle size is 2.0–2.5 nm. The larger particle size results in the smallest performance improvement caused by the synergy between Ru nanoparticles and the N-doped support. HRTEM images (Fig. 2e and Fig. 2f) indicate the lattice fringes with spacings of 0.1136 nm and 0.1219 nm, corresponding to the (222) crystal plane of Pt and the (103) crystal plane of Ru, respectively. HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping results in Fig. 2(g-i) present the uniform distribution of C, N and Pd/Pt/Ru elements on NPCN. In order to characterize the surface compositions and chemical valence of the catalysts, we performed XPS measurements. Fig. 3 a and Fig. 3b are the high-resolution O 1s spectra of PCN, NPCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN. It can be seen that there are COOH, COH and CHO groups on the porous carbon surface, and there are obvious metal oxides (MO) peaks in the spectra of Pd-NPCN and Ru-NPCN. After the introduction of melamine, the total content of CHO and COH groups increased from 72.9 at% of PCN to 78.3 at% of NPCN. Other research works have reported that COH and CHO groups have a reducing effect, and play a significant role in the electroless deposition of metal particles, which is conducive to the loading of nanoparticles on the surface of the carriers [35–39]. Compared with NPCN, the content of COH and CHO groups of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN involved in the reduction processes decreased. From Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, it can be seen that their content decreased from 78.3 at% of NPCN to 76.3, 61.2 and 74.5 at% of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN, respectively. Fig. 3c is the high-resolution N 1s spectra of NPCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN. From the N 1s spectra of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN, we can first see that there are no peaks near 397 eV, which indicates that none of the Pd/Pt/Ru metals formed chemical bonds with the N element. In addition, the presence of graphitic N (400.9 eV), pyrrolic N (399.7 eV) and pyridinic N (398.7 eV) can be observed in the N 1s spectra of NPCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN, which proves the successful doping of heteroatom N onto porous carbon [40,41]. It can also be seen that their graphitic N and pyridinic N peaks are relatively obvious. In previous studies, it has been reported that the Gibbs free energy of graphitic N as an intermediary to adsorb H* is the smallest among these N-species, which is beneficial to the catalysis of HER [42]. Fig. 3d is the high-resolution Pd 3d spectrum of Pd-NPCN, which can be divided into two groups of peaks, corresponding to Pd2+ (342.8 eV, 337.9 eV) and Pd0 (341.0 eV, 336.0 eV). The high-resolution Pt 4f spectrum of Pt-NPCN in Fig. 3e shows three groups of peaks, corresponding to Pt4+ (76.4 eV, 73.5 eV), Pt2+ (75.6 eV, 72.6 eV) and Pt0 (74.9 eV, 71.8 eV). The high-resolution C1s + Ru 3d spectrum of Ru-NPCN in Fig. 3f shows that Ru has two groups of peaks, corresponding to Rux (286.3 eV, 282.8 eV) and Ru0 (285.1 eV, 281.0 eV), where 2 < x ≤ 3. The above results prove that through solution and annealing treatment, the high-valent metals (Pd/Pt/Ru) in the precursors can be effectively reduced to zero valence. Fig. 3f also shows that the high-resolution C 1s spectrum of Ru-NPCN is divided into three peaks: OCO (288.7 eV), COC (286.3 eV) and CC (284.8 eV), corresponding to the C 1s spectra of PCN, NPCN, Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN and Pd/Pt-NPCN (Fig. S4d and Fig. S5). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of PCN, NPCN and Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN are shown in Fig. 3g. Only Pt-NPCN with more metal agglomeration has a small bulge at 39.76°, which corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of Pt. No obvious Pd and Ru metal diffraction peaks are observed. These results correspond to the small size of metal nanoparticles supported on NPCN. Fig. 3h shows the Raman spectra results of PCN, NPCN, Pd-PCN and Pd-NPCN. All samples have D (1340 m−1) and G (1585 cm−1) bands, which proves that they all have disordered carbon and structural defects. The ID/IG ratio values of NPCN and Pd-PCN are slightly larger than PCN, and the ID/IG value of Pd-NPCN is the largest among the four samples. This proves that in the presence of both the introduction of melamine and Pd metal loading, the Pd-NPCN catalyst has the highest defect concentration. These defects can change the charge and spin distribution, thereby affecting the electrocatalytic activity [19]. Besides, the BET measurement results show that both PCN (1497.2 m2 g−1) and NPCN (1350.5 m2 g−1) have large specific surface areas, which can provide a large number of loading sites for metal nanoparticles. The corresponding N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 3i."
8,Electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization The electrochemical characterization of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN were performed in 1.0 M KOH solutions. For comparison, the electrochemical characterization of PCN, NPCN, commercial 20% Pt/C and Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN were also implemented under the same conditions. All LSV curves had been IR-compensated, and the corresponding Rs values are shown in Table S3. As shown in Fig. 4 a, PCN and NPCN without metal loading have no obvious electrocatalytic activity. After loading metal nanoparticles, Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN all exhibit excellent HER electrocatalytic activity. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, Pd-NPCN, Pt-NPCN and Ru-NPCN only need extremely low overpotentials of 21, 9, and 11 mV, respectively, which are superior to commercial 20 % Pt/C (23 mV) measured with the same conditions. It is worth mentioning that the electrocatalytic activity of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN at high current density is also excellent. At a current density of 240 mA cm−2, they all have an overpotential of less than 200 mV, as shown in Fig. 4b. It is also found that the HER electrocatalytic activity of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN are all better than that of Pd/Pt/Ru-PCN. The most significant change is that at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Pd-NPCN (21 mV) is 77 mV lower than that of Pd-PCN (98 mV). The introduction of melamine has a relatively weak effect on the performance of Pt/Ru-loaded porous carbon, but the improvement of their catalytic activity gradually becomes prominent at high current densities. At a current density of 240 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Pt-NPCN compared to Pt-PCN decreased from 158 mV to 105 mV, and the overpotential of Ru-NPCN compared to Ru-PCN decreased from 110 mV to 89 mV. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 4c that the Tafel slopes of Pd-NPCN (49 mV dec−1), Pt-NPCN (30 mV dec−1) and Ru-NPCN (30 mV dec−1) are all smaller than that of 20% Pt/C (51 mV dec−1), and the Tafel slopes of Pd-NPCN, Pt-NPCN and Ru-NPCN are smaller than those of Pd-PCN, Pt-PCN and Ru-PCN, respectively. This is not only consistent with the LSV curves (Fig. 4a), but also indicates that Volmer and Tafel reactions are two rate-limiting steps in the electrode reactions. By comparing our test results with other HER catalysts with excellent performance (including overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes) in 1.0 M KOH in recent years, it is found that the Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN catalysts developed in this work have outstanding performance, as shown in Fig. 4f. The metal mass activity of 20% Pt/C and Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN was also compared, as shown in Fig. 4d. The mass loading of platinum group metals on Pd-NPCN (Pd wt%=10.915%), Pt-NPCN (Pt wt%=9.215%) and Ru-NPCN (Ru wt%=10.551%) were measured by ICP-OES. As shown in Fig. 4e, under 50 mV and 100 mV overpotentials, the metal mass activity of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN is all higher than that of 20% Pt/C. Especially at the overpotential of 100 mV, the metal mass activity of Pd-NPCN (0.98 A mg−1 metal) is about 3 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C (0.37 A mg−1 metal), while the metal mass activity of Pt-NPCN (2.90 A mg−1 metal) and Ru-NPCN (3.07 A mg−1 metal) is about 8 times higher than that of 20% Pt/C. It is worth mentioning that, as can be seen from Fig. S7 and Table S3, the Rct of 20% Pt/C, Pd-NPCN, Pt-NPCN and Ru-NPCN are 27.54, 23.37, 6.308 and 6.69 Ω, respectively, which are consistent with their HER activity test results. As shown in Fig. 4g, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values of Pd-NPCN, Pt-NPCN and Ru-NPCN are 85, 122 and 99 mF cm−2, respectively, which are all significantly greater than that of 20% Pt/C (52 mF cm−2), indicating that Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN can expose more active sites during the electrocatalytic process. Stability is also an important factor in evaluating the performance of electrocatalysts, which test results are shown in Fig. 4h. In order to ensure the comparability between different samples, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) stability tests selected the different voltage ranges corresponding to the same current density of 0–100 mA cm−2 when each sample was working. It can be seen that Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN remains stable after 1000 cycles in 1.0 M KOH, with only slight performance degradation. The embedded η-t curves also show that Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN can remain stable after working at a current density of 30 mA cm−2 for 20 h, with only a slight drop in the curve. These results prove the excellent long-term usability of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN. To explore the effect of different amounts of melamine on the catalytic performance of HER, different Pd-NPCN samples with PCN/melamine mass ratios of 2:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, and 1:7 were prepared and tested. It can be seen from the LSV curves (Fig. 4i) that compared with the previously used PCN/melamine mass ratio of 1:3, the HER catalytic performance of Pd-NPCN gradually decreases when the amount of melamine is reduced to the PCN/melamine mass ratio of 1:1 and 2:1. This may be attributed to the reduction of N-species doped on the carbon carrier and the reduced amount of melamine cannot provide sufficient protection for the formation of NPCN at high temperatures. In addition, when the amount of melamine was increased to PCN/melamine mass ratio of 1:5 and 1:7, the catalytic performance also gradually decreased compared with the mass ratio of 1:3. This may be attributed to the formation of a large amount of carbon nitride compounds after pyrolysis with much more melamine, making the metal nanoparticles unable to be effectively loaded on the porous carbon. Inspired by the outstanding performance of the Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN catalysts in 1.0 M KOH, we further tested the HER electrocatalytic performance at acidic conditions (0.5 M H2SO4). The corresponding LSV curves are shown in Fig. 5 a. It can be seen that Pd-NPCN and Pt-NPCN still have excellent catalytic performance compared to commercial 20% Pt/C. Besides, the performance improvement caused by the introduction of melamine still significantly works for Pd-NPCN in 0.5 M H2SO4. The further comparison of 20% Pt/C and Pd/Pt-NPCN under acidic condition is shown in Fig. 5b. At the current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential of Pd-NPCN (32 mV) is close to 20% Pt/C (25 mV), while Pt-NPCN shows a very low overpotential of 19 mV, and its metal mass activity at the overpotential of 100 mV is about 2.1 times of 20% Pt/C."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we developed a new type of N-doped porous carbon nanosheets loaded with platinum group metals (Pd, Pd or Ru). In situ reduction method was utilized to load small size metal nanoparticles onto porous carbon nanosheets with a large specific surface area, and a simple pyrolysis method was used to introduce the melamine for modification. The prepared Pd-NPCN, Pt-NPCN and Ru-NPCN with the metal content of about 10 wt% exhibited outstanding HER catalytic performance and good stability in 1.0 M KOH. The achieved low overpotentials (η10 = 21, 9 and 11 mV) at 10 mA cm−2, small Tafel slopes (49, 30 and 30 mV dec−1), high metal mass activity values (0.98, 2.90 and 3.07 A mg−1 metal) and large double-layer capacitance values (85, 122 and 99 mF cm−2) are all superior to commercial 20% Pt/C, and also outstanding in past relative research works. In addition, we found that the introduction of melamine not only realized the doping of N-species, but also optimized the morphology and surface functional groups of the prepared catalysts. The synergy between the uniformly distributed small size metal nanoparticles and the N-doped carriers can improve the catalytic activity of the metal-loaded porous carbon nanosheets. Due to the replaceability of the carbon carrier, this is instructive for the application of this heteroatom modification method using melamine to other materials, and these results demonstrate the high efficiency of Pd/Pt/Ru-NPCN in HER catalysis and their potential for large-scale industrial applications."
