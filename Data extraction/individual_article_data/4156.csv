0,Introduction,"With the improved public awareness of the relationships between climate change and anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sustainable production of energy and chemicals through renewable biomass has become a new research focus in the past few decades [1–4]. The conversion processes of bio-refineries, however, may differ from those currently used in the conventional petrochemical industry owing to two major reasons: (1) oxygen is the major element in raw biomass feedstock [5–8], and (2) cleavage or modification of the carbon-oxygen bonds is required during or after the depolymerization of raw biomass. A host of thermochemical conversion technologies, including hydrolysis [1,9], hydrodeoxygenation [10,11], oxidation [12,13], esterification [14,15], and pyrolysis [16,17], have been developed to meet the need for biomass upgrading, and catalysts have been identified as the focal point of the biomass degradation process. Various types of catalysts (e.g. homogeneous and heterogeneous, acidic and alkaline) have been developed for the biomass conversion [18,19]. The solid acid catalysts with functional structures are recognized as the potential solution due to their environmental and operational advantages, i.e. easy to separate and recycle, less corrosive, and safer to use [20,21]. Solid niobium-based species, including niobic acid/hydrated niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5n H2O), niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), niobium phosphate (NbOPO4), and their supported materials (e.g. noble metal/NbOPO4), are unique acid catalysts. The Nb-based catalysts exhibit effective catalytic activity in various types of reactions, e.g. oxidation [22,23], dehydration [24,25], photochemistry [26,27] and electrochemistry [28,29]. Niobium-containing chemicals have been also widely employed as solid acid catalysts for the conversion of biomass or biomass-derivatives to biofuel and bio-based chemicals in the past few decades (Tables 1–5 and Fig. 1 ), and they exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability. The overall review of progress and challenges on biomass conversion via niobium catalysis, however, are limited. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive review of biomass catalytic conversion over four groups of Nb-based catalysts, i.e. niobic acid, Nb2O5, NbOPO4, and Nb-supported materials. The sections of this article are organized as (1) a brief introduction, (2) properties of common Nb-based catalysts, (3) production of platform chemicals, (4) pyrolysis for hydrocarbon production, (5) esterification, (6) hydrogenation, (7) oxidation, and (8) summary and future prospect."
1,Properties of Nb-based catalysts,"Niobium, one of the most abundant elements in the crust of earth [98], belongs to group VA and possesses many properties similar to its predecessors in group IVA [99,100]. Extraordinarily, niobium is a nontoxic element and can be even utilized in medical devices [101,102]. Thus, niobium was employed for various applications including the production of catalysts. Niobic acid, Nb2O5, NbOPO4, and their supported materials have been employed for biomass conversion. The basic properties of these catalysts are summarized in Table 6 ."
2,Niobic acid,"2.1 Niobic acid Niobic acid, a white and water-insoluble solid, can be obtained by hydrolysis of pentavalent niobium salt (e.g. NbCl5 and Nb(OC2H5)5) [40], and is an amorphous metal oxide composed of distorted NbO4 tetrahedra and NbO6 octahedral (Fig. 2 a) [106,107]. Previous studies showed that niobic acid has a specific area of 63−177 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.11−0.15 cm3/g (entries 17–19 in Table 6). The specific area and pore volume, however, decreased when metal was loaded (entries 18 and 20 in Table 6). Niobic acid has a strong Hammett titration acidity (H0 ≤ -5.6), ∼70 % of sulfuric acid [75], and possesses both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites (Fig. 2a, entry 17 in Table 6). The Brönsted acid sites are mainly contributed by the presence of OH groups on the surface and are associated with the highly polarized Nb-O bonds in the distorted polyhedrons [106–108], whereas Lewis acid sites are related to the presence of NbO4 tetrahedra and can preserve its functionality even after the formation of NbO4-H2O adducts in water [40]. Note that the strong acid sites of niobic acid disappear when under high temperatures [109], and become almost neutral when the temperature is > 500 °C [110]. Thus, most niobic acid catalytic reactions were performed < 500 °C."
3,Niobium pentoxide,"2.2 Niobium pentoxide Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) is obtained from the complete dehydration of niobic acid via calcination at 90−180 °C [111]. The calcination temperature has crucial impacts on the properties of Nb2O5. High calcination temperature usually results in relatively low surface area and pore volume, but larger pore diameter (entries 9–13 in Table 6); the specific surface area and pore volume of Nb2O5 are in the range of 4−194 m2/g and 0.013−0.219 cm3/g, respectively (entries 1–13 in Table 6). Meanwhile, the total amount of acid sites (H0 ≤ 6.8) and the fraction of strong acid sites (-8.2≤ H0 ≤-3.0) decreases with the increase of calcination temperature, while the fraction of medium strong and weak acid sites (-3.0 ≤ H0 ≤6.8) increases with calcination temperature [34]. The decrease of acid sites mainly results from the transformation of protonic sites to Lewis sites via removal of water [112,113]. As the fraction of acid sites and textural properties are essential factors for catalyst activity, the calcination temperature needs to be optimized. Nb2O5 was also found to possess the highest acid strength when pretreating at 100 °C [109], whereas the strong acid sites of SiO2-Al2O3 and SiO2-TiO2 are usually formed via high-temperature treatment, i.e. > 500 °C [114]. Besides, the catalytic efficiency of Nb2O5 depends on its microstructure. For instance, amorphous Nb2O5 has more acid sites in comparison with Nb2O5 crystal, as the amorphous Nb2O5 has high acidic tetrahedral niobia with a NbO bond, whereas the crystal structure only has mild acidic octahedral niobia [106]. The amorphous Nb2O5 can transform into crystal structure when heated at > 500 °C [112]. The mesoporous Nb2O5 (Fig. 2b) and nano-structured Nb2O5, in general, are preferred for catalytic application owing to their higher specific surface area. Note that the preparation of mesoporous Nb2O5 usually uses templating routes [46,115], whereas the preparation of nano-structured Nb2O5 requires precipitation and sol-gel synthesis followed by calcination [116]. Gao et al. synthesized ordered mesoporous carbon-niobium oxide composites by a multi-component co-assembly method, in which niobium species are well dispersed in the amorphous carbon framework [36]. A higher fraction (38–75 %) of Nb2O5 were found to result in a composite with higher acidity but lower specific surface area (306.4−124.5 m2 g−1) [36]. Composite oxides containing niobia (Nb2O5) and other metal oxides (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2) were prepared for dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions [107], and the Lewis and Bronsted acidity can be adjusted by the niobia concentrations [113]."
4,NbOPO4,"2.3 NbOPO4 Niobium phosphate (NbOPO4) is a stronger solid acid catalyst (H0 ≤ −8.2) in comparison with the niobic acid [31]. A NbO6 octahedron and a PO4 tetrahedron are formed in NbOPO4 by Nb and P with its nearest O atoms, respectively (Fig. 2c-e) [117]. The PO4 tetrahedron and NbO6 octahedron are connected as an ensemble by sharing the O corner atoms [117]. As niobic acid, NbOPO4 contains both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites (see entries 22–24, 27–31, 35, 37, 48–53 in Table 6), and the latter is usually attributed to the corresponding unsaturated Nb5+ cations [30,118]. Zhao et al. reported that the Lewis acid sites originated from the NbO bonding structures include slightly distorted octahedral NbO6, regular tetrahedral NbO4 and highly distorted octahedral NbO6 [103]. The Brönsted acid sites were found to have both POH and NbOH groups (Fig. 2 g and h), which co-exist on the surface of NbOPO4 [118,119]. The POH groups are stronger Brönsted acids comparing to the NbOH [30], confirming that the NbOPO4 has a lower H0 than niobic acid. NbOPO4 had a broad range of surface area (21−427 m2/g) and pore volume (0.02−0.46 cm3/g) depending on the preparation method (see entries 24−54 in Table 6). In general, NbOPO4 can be synthesized by (1) direct calcination of the mixture of Nb2O5 and phosphorus pentoxide [120], (2) precipitation [121], and (3) sol-gel methods [33,122]. The advantage of the sol-gel methods is that the reagents have sufficient time to react, as the starting metal salts can be dissolved homogeneously [123]. Gao et al. synthesized hierarchically porous NbOPO4 via a sol-gel method by using poly(acrylamide) and poly(ethylene glycol) as phase separation inducers, and the NbOPO4 obtained has a comparably high surface area (140 m2 g−1) and acidity (0.84 mmol-NH3 g−1) [33]. Various templating agents for precipitation were employed to achieve a high surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the catalyst. Zhang et al. synthesized porous NbOPO4 using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the template, and the product has a high surface area (213−297 m2/g) and narrow pore size distribution (3−4 nm) [32]. Mal et al. generated micro-pore NbOPO4 by using hexadecyl amine and hexylamine as templates [124,125]. Sarkar and Pramanik synthesized mesoporous niobium oxophosphate (427 m2/g) using alkyl surfactant and tetradecyl trimethylammonium bromide as the organic template [126]. The surface acidity and fraction of acid sites (Brönsted and Lewis acid) on the NbOPO4 can be controlled by adjusting the pH in synthetic processes [38]. The amounts of acid sites, BET surface area, and the ratio of Brönsted to Lewis acid of the catalyst generally decreases with the increase of pH (entries 41–53 in Table 6). NbOPO4 synthesized at pH = 2 were reported to have the highest fraction of Brönsted acid sites and total acid sites, whereas the Brönsted acid sites almost disappeared when the pH = 10 [38]. Meanwhile, the molar ratio of Nb/P in the precursor increases with pH value, which leads to a high ratio of Lewis to Brönsted acid sites and results in high Lewis acidity of the catalyst [32,51,127]. Calcination is an essential step for the formation of NbOPO4. The calcination temperature plays a crucial role in catalyst properties, and the acidity of catalysts generally decreases with the increase of calcination temperature [54]. Meanwhile, the surface area and pore volume of the NbOPO4 were found initially increases with the calcination temperature (350−550 °C) but then decreases with the increase of calcination temperatures (550−850 °C) [54]. This may result from the removal of organic surfactants from pores at relative mild calcination temperature and the formation of crystalline niobium oxophosphate phase at high temperatures (e.g. 850 °C). Similarly, Gao et al. found that the monolith was amorphous after calcination at 600 °C, but then transformed into an α-NbOPO4 phase at 1000 °C [33]. NbOPO4 was reported to have a melting point of > 1650 °C, and the transforming temperature from the tetragonal phase to the monoclinic phase is ∼1253 °C [120]. Noted that NbOPO4 exhibited a slower decline of catalytic activity in catalytic reaction comparing to niobic acid owing to better thermal stability [69]. For instance, NbOPO4 can still keep high isomerization activity under a pre-treatment temperature of 500 °C [112]. Overall, Nb-based catalysts have attracted considerable attention to biomass upgrading owing to their low-cost, special acid properties (containing both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites), and good thermal stability. One of the key advantages of Nb-based catalysts is water-tolerant, as water is usually concomitantly generated or presented in most biomass refining processes. Water adsorption on amorphous Nb2O5 and NbOPO4, however, was observed: a small fraction of water was strongly adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, whereas the major fraction was adsorbed by physical adsorption [56]. It should be noted that easy recovery and high reusability characteristics of Nb-based catalysts have been demonstrated in both aqueous and organic solvent systems [45,46,67,70,90]."
5,Production of platform chemicals,
6,Dehydration for 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde,"3.1 Dehydration for 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) is regarded as a crucial platform chemical obtained from biomass acid hydrolysis; it can be further converted to a series of polymers resins, solvents, and chemical intermediates [1,13]. Meanwhile, HMF is a good source for the production of gasoline or diesel range fuels (C9–C15) [128,129]. HMF can be obtained from dehydration of biomass through acid catalysis (route 1−3 in Fig. 1) with various homogeneous (e.g. HCl, H2SO4, AlCl3) [130,131] and heterogeneous catalysts (e.g. α-l-ZrP2O7, Lγ-ZrP, ZrO2, TiO2, sulfonated carbon) [132–134]. HMF obtained, however, can further be re-hydrated to levulinic acid (LA) under strong or concentrated acid conditions (route 4 in Fig. 2) [135–140]. The acid catalysts with relative mild acidity, therefore, is preferred for HMF production [141,142], and Nb-based catalysts are a potential candidate for HMF production. 3.1.1 Catalytic characteristics of Nb-based catalysts Niobic acid and NbOPO4 are effective catalysts for dehydration of saccharides (including fructose, sucrose, and inulin) to HMF; and high selectivity (>90 %) to HMF was obtained by preventing the formation of LA [37]. NbOPO4 was found to exhibit a higher conversion rate of fructose in comparison with niobic acid and possesses superior catalytic activity and selectivity to HMF and deeper decay for deactivation at a short time on stream. The improved catalytic activity of NbOPO4 is attributed to its higher intrinsic effective acidity and increased surface acid sites, maintained via highly polar and protic media [31,143]. Wang et al. reported that Nb2O5 and niobic acid resulted in the same conversion rate of fructose, but the Nb2O5 held a higher selectivity to HMF than the niobic acid [34]. Since the catalytic activity of Nb2O5 for HMF production is highly affected by the calcination temperature, the amorphous high acidity Nb2O5 produced with low calcination temperature (e.g. 300 °C) usually has low selectivity to HMF owing to the side reactions promoted by the presence of strong acid sites [34]. Kreissl et al. compared the catalytic effects of five types of niobium oxides, i.e. layer niobium oxide (hy-Nb), monolayer niobium oxide (hy-Nb-TEOA), HNb3O8, Nb2O5, and mesoporous Nb2O5, on the conversion of sucrose [124]. The conversion rate is in the order of mesoporous Nb2O5 (36 %) > hy-Nb (32 %) > hy-Nb-TEOA (28 %) > HNb3O8 (18 %) > Nb2O5 (13 %) > no catalyst (5%), whereas the HMF yield is mesoporous Nb2O5 (36 %) > HNb3O8 (34 %) > hy-Nb (30 %) > hy-Nb-TEOA (27 %) = Nb2O5 (27 %) = no catalyst (27 %). Furthermore, Zhang et al. found that the mesoporous NbOPO4 prepared at a relatively low pH (= 2) has the highest selectivity to HMF, due to the presence of abundant acidic sites and high Bronsted sites [32]. Thus, the increase of the mesoporous NbOPO4 dosage can increase the conversion of fructose, but the HMF selectivity would be reduced when the dosage is too high [32]. Similar to other solid acid catalysts, deactivation of niobic acid for fructose dehydration reaction was observed owing to the formation and deposition of humins on the catalyst surface [143,144]. The stability of niobic acid, however, can be improved by ion-doping (e.g. K, Ba, and Nd), and the K-species results in a lighter modulation of the niobic acid activity in comparison with the Ba- and Nd-species [145]. The improved stability is usually associated with the direct interaction of the strong acid sites on the Nb2O5 catalyst with the basic dopants (i.e., K, Ba, and Nd), which helps to prohibit the formation of insoluble humins [145]. Thus, the catalyst activity is maintained due to the presence of weak acid sites on the catalyst. 3.1.2 Comparison of catalytic activity The catalytic activity of Nb-based catalysts was compared with that of other solid acid catalysts for HMF production in dehydration of sugars, and Nb2O5 exhibited better catalytic activity than the γ-Al2O3 [34]. Hierarchically porous NbOPO4 was found to be more efficient in the dehydration process of fructose to HMF in comparison with HY zeolite, Nb2O5, ZrO2, and ZrP [33], and the productivity of HMF reached 7.3 × 10−2 mol h−1 per kg solution when the initial fructose concentration is 10.0 % wt [33]. Besides, the mesoporous NbOPO4 exhibited superior catalytic activity comparing to Ambersty-15, Beta, and ZSM-5 [32]. The mesoporous NbOPO4 also exhibited better thermal stability than other acidic resin catalysts (e.g. Amberlyst-15) under normal hydrolysis temperature (i.e. 100−200 °C), as the acidic resin catalysts often require low reaction temperature, i.e. below 130 °C, to protect their organic frameworks. Note that the used mesoporous NbOPO4 can be regenerated by calcination at 500 °C [32]. 3.1.3 Application of Nb-based catalysts for biphasic systems The in-situ extraction of 5-HMF by a bi-phase system has been developed to (1) inhibit the re-hydration and oligomerization of HMF, (2) improve the HMF selectivity, and (3) reduce the deposition of organic polymers on solid acid catalyst [146–148]. The impacts of organic solvents on the 5-HMF production via Nb-based catalysts have been investigated (entries 7–9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 24–29 in Table 1). The yield of HMF can reach 33.2 % when the conversion of glucose over NbOPO4 is in pure water, and the yield increases to 39.3 % in a biphasic water/ methyl isobutyl ketone medium [38]. Similarly, the selectivity of HMF using the NbOPO4 catalyst is 55.73 % and 62.94 % in pure water and water-acetone system, respectively [35]. Besides, DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) was also proved to be an effective organic solvent for the biphasic systems, and adding DMSO in the aqueous solution can remarkably improve the HMF yield and selectivity over NbOPO4 [33]. 100 % conversion of fructose and 76.5 % selectivity to HMF can be reached when an ordered mesoporous carbon-niobium oxide composite and DMSO are utilized [36]. The inclusion of some solvents (e.g. ethanol) in the reaction solution, however, has negative impacts on the conversion of fructose and HMF selectivity owing to the decrease of acidity in the aqueous solution [33,149]. Meanwhile, the cost of HMF production over NbOPO4 catalysis was investigated, and the HMF unit cost can decrease from 3.05 USD/kg in the water system to 2.21 USD/kg in the water-acetone solution [35]. As the HMF price is mainly affected by the cost of fructose [35], more investigations are needed for developing technologies for HMF production from cheaper biomass materials. 3.1.4 Advantages of Nb-based catalysts In comparison with fructose, glucose is a much more abundant and cheaper chemical present in nature. Glucose, however, has a very stable glucose ring, which makes the dehydration process more difficult. Thus, a two-step processing for HMF production with routine acid catalysis is often recommended, i.e. isomerization of glucose to fructose and dehydration of fructose to HMF (routes 2 and 3 in Fig. 1). NbOPO4 was demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst for the conversion of sucrose, cellobiose, starch, and cellulose to HMF in a one-pot reaction, with a yield of 30.7 %, 39.9 %, 30.9 %, and 16.2 %, respectively [38]. Solid acidic NbOx/ZrO2 catalysts were also employed for the transformation of cellulose to glucose and HMF in pure hot water, and the yields of glucose and 5-HMF achieve 22 and 16 % mol, respectively [50]. These good catalytic effects mainly result from that Nb-based catalysts can (1) hydrolyze polysaccharides to glucose over Brönsted acid sites, (2) transform of glucose to fructose via Lewis acid sites, and (3) form HMF by dehydration of fructose generated via both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites [38]. Meanwhile, the Nb-based catalyst is also water-tolerant and very stable in the polar catalytic system, making it reusable [38]. It has been summarized that the isomerization reaction of glucose to fructose can be catalyzed by enzyme, base, and Lewis acid catalysts [1]. Enzyme and base, however, are not suitable for the one-pot reaction in acid media, even though industrial-scale immobilized enzymes have been employed for the isomerization reaction [150,151]. In general, Lewis acids catalyze the isomerization reaction via promoting the intramolecular hydride shift transformation of the open form from glucose to fructose, and the advantages of Lewis acids are their capability to coexist with Brönsted acids [1]. Common Lewis acids for HMF production include homogeneous metal chlorides (e.g. AlCl3, CrCl2 or SnCl4) and solid zeolites (e.g. Metal-ZSM-5, zeolite Y, and mordenite) [152–157]. The homogeneous metal chlorides exhibit better performance in the isomerization and dehydration process. Recovery and reuse of aqueous metal chlorides, however, are still challenging, and aqueous chromium ions are toxic [158,159]. In fact, metal chlorides, as Lewis acid catalyst for HMF production, usually require special solvents, e.g. expensive ionic liquids [160,161]. Solid zeolites also have disadvantages owing to their low hydrothermal stability, as catalyst deactivation via dealumination and collapse of framework occurs when under thigh-temperature water-vapor surrounding conditions [154,161,162]. Nb-based catalyst, therefore, exhibits obvious advantages owing to their superior catalytic activity on isomerization and dehydration and better stability. During the process of accelerating the isomerization reaction, Lewis acid, however, can also promote the formation of humins, resulting in reduced HMF yield [163–165]. To understand interactions of coupled Lewis and Brønsted acids in reactions and increase the yield and formation rate of HMF, several tandem Lewis/Brønsted acid catalysts were investigated in water and/or organic solvents (e.g. 1,2-dimethoxyethane, alkylphenol, cyclopentyl methyl ether), including the AlCl3/H3PO4 [166], CrCl3/HCl [165,167], Sn-BEA/HCl [168], AlCl3/HCl [152,164]. The highest HMF yield of 49.42 % is reached when the AlCl3 - H3PO4 ratio is 1: 0.8 for the conversion of microcrystalline cellulose [166], whereas the preferred ratio of Lewis (Sn-BEA) to Brønsted acid (HCl) sites is ∼ 0.3 to reach the maximum HMF production rate and yield when utilizing glucose as feedstock [168]. Weak Lewis acid sites were found to be able to promote the HMF production, while the medium to strong Lewis acid sites generally result in the formation of undesirable by-products (e.g. humins) [163]. Thus, the Lewis acid/Brønsted acid and weak/total Lewis acid ratio of the catalysts are crucial factors for biomass conversion, and the Nb-based catalysts are preferred owing to possessing both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites and its tunable acidity. Moreover, the Nb-based catalyst (Nb0.15Al0.85Si25O) with a high weak/total Lewis acid ratio and suitable Lewis acid/Brønsted acid ratio was found to be capable of promoting the conversion of glucose to HMF with comparably high selectivity, 71 % [163]. The design and preparation of more effective catalysts to produce HMF with improved yield and faster production rate, therefore, is essential."
7,Hydrolysis for levulinic acid,"3.2 Hydrolysis for levulinic acid Levulinic acid (LA) is another valuable platform chemical from biomass acid hydrolysis and has a market prospect for the production of liquid fuels, spice, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, pesticide, and fungicide [1,169]. LA has even been regarded as a bridge chemical connecting sustainable biomass and conventional fossil fuel processing [170]. In general, LA can be produced from HMF through rehydration with strong acid catalysts (route 4 in Fig. 2), and modified Nb-based catalysts have been demonstrated to be good candidates (entries 34 and 35 in Table 1). Cellulose can be directly converted to LA with the presence of aluminum-modified mesoporous NbOPO4 in aqueous solution at 180 °C for 24 h, and the yield can reach 52.9 % [49], which is still lower than that from homogeneous acid catalysis but much higher than that from other solid acid catalysts [171]. The doping of aluminum on the catalyst is the key factor to enhance the strong Lewis and Brönsted acids on the NbOPO4, which finally promotes the LA generation from cellulose [49]. LA can be obtained from furfural through a two-step process, i.e. hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and dehydration of furfuryl alcohol to LA (routes 17 and 18 in Fig. 1) [172–174]. Fang et al. developed a one-pot cascade conversion of furfural to LA over Cu-doped NbOPO4 catalysts, and the yield reaches 67.0 % mol at 160 °C after 3 h reaction [175]. In this process, the Cu on the Cu-doped NbOPO4 promoted the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, and the Brönsted acid sites on NbOPO4 promoted the hydration of furfuryl alcohol to LA [175]. Based on the Cu-doped NbOPO4, the one-pot process showed significant advantages in reducing unit operations, i.e. avoids the separation process of intermediate furfuryl alcohol and hydrogenation catalysts."
8,Dehydration for furfural,"3.3 Dehydration for furfural Furfural, a bio-derived platform chemical, has been broadly used as a feedstock for producing chemical intermediates, pharmaceutics, plastics, and agrochemicals [176–178]. Furfural can also be upgraded to a series of biofuels, such as methyl tetrahydrofuran and ethyl-tetrahydro furfuryl ethers, C10–C15 hydrocarbons, and gasoline replacement [179,180]. Similar to HMF, the formation of furfural from xylose dehydration is generally through two main pathways [181,182]: (1) the isomerization of xylose to xylulose and dehydration of xylulose to furfural; (2) direct dehydration of xylose (route 14 in Fig.1). The isomerization and dehydration processes are usually catalyzed by the Lewis and the Brönsted acid, respectively. Nb-based catalysts were employed for furfural production (entries 18–25 in Table 1). Gupta reported that Nb2O5 was an efficient catalyst for furfural production from xylose, and the conversion ratio and selectivity reache 93 % and 48 % at 120 °C, respectively [45]. Nb2O5 also exhibited better catalytic activity and higher selectivity in comparison with common homogeneous Brönsted and Lewis acid catalysts (e.g. HCl and Sc(OTf)3), due to the lowered activation energy, i.e. 83, 107, and 131 kJ mol−1 for Nb2O5, Sc(OTf)3 and HCl, respectively [45]. Phosphoric acid-treated niobic acid (NbP) was also found to have a better catalytic performance than other common catalysts including zirconium phosphate, sulfated zirconia, H-β and H–Y zeolite catalysts, and the yield of furfural is 22.5 % when the reaction is conducted at 160 °C for 1 h [41]. The excellent performance of NbP may associate with the better synergistic cooperation between Brönsted and Lewis acid sites [41]. Carvalho et al. reported that the mixture catalyst of niobic acid and NbOPO4 can improve the selectivity of furfural from xylose dehydration, and a furfural selectivity of 74.71 % with 44.05 % xylose conversion was obtained [43]. The textural properties of Nb-based catalyst have major impacts on the catalytic activity. The efficiency of the mesoporous Nb2O5 catalyst was much higher than that of the commercial Nb2O5, as the mesoporous structure facilitates the accessibility of xylose molecules to the acid sites located in the pores [46]. Bernal et al. found that both Bronsted and Lewis acidic sites on NbOPO4 can act synergistically and led to improved conversion of xylose and corn stover hydrolysates to furfural [118]. As both Lewis and Brönsted sites were exposed on the surface of the used catalysts with a slightly weaker in acidic strength and more heterogeneous than that over the fresh catalyst during the reaction, the NbOPO4 catalyst exhibited better reusability [118]. Similar to the HMF reaction, the addition of a water-immiscible solvent to form a biphasic system can greatly improve the furfural selectivity, as the formed furfural can be in-situ extracted into the organic phase to avoid other side reactions [21,152,183]. Non-polar hydrophobic organic solvents with higher solubility to furfural were explored for the in-suit extraction (entries 18, 24, 25 in Table 1). For instance, a higher furfural selectivity, 17–24 %, was achieved over Nb2O5 in a biphasic (water + toluene or water + xylene) system [45]. In addition, a higher yield of furfural, 68.4 %, was achieved with the presence of NbOPO4 in a methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)/water (containing NaCl) bi-phase solution in comparison with 49.8 % in aqueous solution [44]. Pholjaroen et al. also compared the effects of a series of biphasic systems (i.e., toluene/water, MIBK/water, n-butanol/water, 2-butanol/water, hexanol/water) with the NbP catalyst, and found that the toluene/water biphasic system has the highest furfural yield [41]."
9,Dehydration of biomass derived alcohols,"3.4 Dehydration of biomass derived alcohols Glycerol, a byproduct of the biodiesel production process (route 21 in Fig. 1), can be dehydrated to valuable acrolein over acid catalysts (route 25 in Fig. 1) [184,185]. Acrolein is an industrial chemical intermediate for the production of l-methionine, acrylic acid, 1,3-propanediol, quinoline, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, and superabsorbent polymers [186,187]. Silica-supported niobia was employed for the catalytic dehydration of glycerol, and the selectivity to acrolein relies on the niobia loading and calcination temperature [55]. Lee et al. reported 68.1 % of glycerol conversion and 72.0 % of acrolein selectivity was achieved with the PO4/Nb2O5 catalyst [52]. The disadvantage of PO4/Nb2O5 catalyst, however, is the low reusability owing to the loss of PO4 in the reaction [52]. Lee et al. investigated the influence of PO4 loading on the PO4/Nb2O5 catalysts and found the amounts of the acidic sites and the strengths of acidity increases with PO4 loading and 20 % wt PO4/Nb2O5 catalyst was a preferred catalyst for gas-phase glycerol dehydration (entry 39 in Table 1) [53]. Rao et al., conducted the vapor-phase dehydration of glycerol to acrolein over a series of NbOPO4 catalysts, and the conversion ratio and selectivity to acrolein are 75−100% and of 69–86 %, respectively [54]. Besides, the catalyst calcined at 550 °C exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency for the formation of acrolein (reaction condition and results are shown in entry 40 in Table 2) Dimethyl ether (DME) can be synthesized directly from biomass-derived syngas via a process with methanol synthesis components and solid acid catalysts [188]. Nb2O5 and NbOPO4 exhibited 100 % selectivity and better stability in this process, although they showed lower catalytic activity than H-ZSM-5 zeolite [56]. Nb-based catalysts have also been employed for the dehydration of other alcohols (entry 42 in Table 1; entries 3 and 4 in Table 2). For instance, Ghosh et al. developed a fullerene [C60] based NbOPO4 catalyst for the production of propylene via isopropanol dehydration, which has a low reaction activation energy of 30 ± 5 kJ/mol, high selectivity of > 99 %, and WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) of 4.7 h−1 [59]. Besides, NbOPO4 and niobic acid were found to be effective in butanol dehydration, and maintain better stability and catalytic activity even under high pressures of water in comparison with Zeolite catalysts (Beta, USY, H-ZSM-5) and zirconia-based catalysts (WOx/ZrO2, MoOx/ZrO2, and MgO/ZrO2) [60]."
10,Pyrolysis for biofuel production,"Nb-based catalysts have been employed for catalytic pyrolysis of biomass to produce biofuels (entries 1, 2, 6–10 in Table 2). Scaldaferri and Pasa utilized a serious of solid acid catalysts including HBeta, ZSM-5, fluid catalytic cracking catalyst, Pd/C, and NbOPO4 to pyrolyze lipids, and found NbOPO4 exhibited the best performance through forming linear and branched hydrocarbons (route 23 in Fig. 1) with a yield up to 90 %wt [57]. Reguera et al. also reported that Nb-based catalysts, i.e. Nb2O5, NbOPO4, and H3PO4/Nb2O5, can be used for catalytic pyrolysis of oleic acid at 350 °C to produce gasoline, diesel, and lubricant oils and NbOPO4 performs best owing to its strong acid sites and high specific area [58]. Besides, Nb2O5 and NbOPO4 were employed to synthesize p-xylene (PX) from biomass-derived 2, 5-dimethylfuran via Diels-Alder reaction, for which 2,5-dimethylfuran conversion rate and PX selectivity can reach 87.2 % and 92.7 %, respectively, indicating that appropriate ratio of Brönsted /Lewis acid and the hierarchical structure of Nb-based catalysts are crucial for the catalytic performance [61]. Meanwhile, Nb-based catalysts are more stable and result in less carbon deposition in the PX synthesis process in comparison with the Sn-Beta catalyst [61,189]. Brandão et al. investigated a series of Nb2O5 based catalysts (i.e. Nb2O5, Nb2O5x H2O, Nb2O5/HX (X = HSO4 −, H2PO4 −, NO3 −)) for the production of biofuels through pyrolysis of soybean oil [63], and found that hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds (e.g. carboxylic acids) were the major products and the type of catalysts does not have significant impacts on the distribution of products. Batista et al. conducted flash pyrolysis of glycerol over niobium catalysts (Nb2O5, Nb2O5 supported on sodium vermiculite and activated vermiculite) using Py-GC–MS, in which organics acids, esters, and aldehydes were found as the main products [62]. Nb2O5/sodium vermiculite, however, exhibited weaker catalytic activity in comparison with the Nb2O5/activated vermiculite and Nb2O5 for the conversion of glycerol [62]. Zhu et al. compared the catalytic activity of Nb2O5 with γ-Al2O3, ZSM-5, and TS-1 for the production of furan through catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose and glucose (routes 11 and 12 in Fig. 1) [66], and found that Nb2O5 can prohibit coke depositions owing to its lowest specific surface area and comparable weak acid sites, but lead to low product selectivity (20.7 %) in comparison with TS-1 (43.9 %). Furthermore, Nb2O5 was found to be more effective in catalytic fast pyrolysis of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin in producing aromatic hydrocarbons at 650 °C, with which a yield of 11.2 wt% and no coke formation were realized [64] and the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formed accounted for 94 % of the total products. On the contrary, Wu et al. reported that Nb2O5/ATP has lower efficiency in pyrolysis of Kraft lignin at 600 °C in comparison with SZA, S2O8 2−/ATP, Nb2O5/ATP, MgO/ATP, and CaO/ATP catalysts [65]. Overall, as pyrolysis of biomass or biomass-derived chemicals to biofuels over solid acid catalysts has become an attractive technology, in-depth systematic studies on biomass catalytic pyrolysis over Nb compounds are needed."
11,Esterification,"Biodiesel is a renewable fuel derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant greases via catalytic esterification and/or transesterification reactions [14,15,18,190,191]. Homogeneous catalyst is usually not favored for biodiesel production due to the costly post-treatment of the waste acidic or alkaline solution and the environmental problems associated. Various solid acid catalysts, therefore, was developed for the transesterification/esterification reactions [190,191]. Nb-based catalysts were also employed for esterification reactions to produce biodiesel and other bio-based chemicals (e.g. 5-ethoxymethylfurfural) (Table 3). Pietre et al. reported that niobic acid can be used for catalytic esterification of oleic acid to produce methyl oleate with a yield of 9% under refluxing at 70 °C for 5 h [71]. Bassan et al. found that NbOPO4 exhibited better performance compared to niobic acid in the esterification process of lauric acid with butanol owing to the presence of superior Brönsted acid sites on NbOPO4 [67]. They also commented that the superior Brönsted acid sites of NbOPO4 are the key factor in promoting the esterification reaction [67]. Meanwhile, the calcination temperature for generating NbOPO4 plays an essential role in its catalytic activity for esterification of oleic acid with ethanol, and the conversion ratio generally decreases with the increase of NbOPO4 calcination temperature (300−600 °C) owing to the decrease of BET surface area and total acidity at high temperatures [69]. The esterification of oleic acid was also found to fit a pseudo-homogeneous first-order reaction [68]. NbOPO4, however, is not a good catalyst for re-esterification of macauba acid oil using glycerol [192]. Acid loaded niobium catalysts were also developed for biodiesel production. Although heteropoly acids such as H4PNbW11O40 and H3PW12O40 exhibit good catalytic performance in biodiesel production, they are usually miscible with the reaction mixture [72,193]. H4PNbW11O40/WO3–Nb2O5 (heteropoly acid loaded on Nb2O5), however, was found insoluble to the reaction mixture and possesses high catalytic activity for transesterification of triolein to ethyloleate [72]. 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) supported niobia catalyst (TPA/Nb2O5) was also reported to be a good solid acid catalyst for the transesterification of waste cooking oil with methanol [70]. In addition, sulfated and phosphated mesoporous niobium oxides exhibited good acid catalytic activities, even though leaching of sulfur species was observed [194]. The ester yields can reach 78 % and 40 % for esterification of oleic acid and transesterification of soybean oil when catalyzed by a sulfated niobic acid (sulfuric acid-treated niobic acid), indicating that introduction of the sulfuric group on the niobic acid results in the formation niobium hydrogen sulfate moieties and improves the catalytic activity [71]. The sulfation process also improves the Brönsted acidity of the catalyst, and the sulfated niobium oxide obtained can reduce the activation energy of the esterification reaction from 68.4–34.7 kJ mol−1 [73]."
12,Hydrogenation,"Nb-based materials have been employed to produce bifunctional hydrogenation catalysts. A series of noble metal loaded catalysts (e.g. Pd/NbOPO4, Pd/Nb2O5, Pt/NbOPO4, Ru/NbOPO4) have been developed (see Table 4) and exhibits good catalytic activity in hydrogenation reactions."
13,Catalytic hydrogenation of platform chemicals,"6.1 Catalytic hydrogenation of platform chemicals 6.1.1 Production of biofuel from furfural As discussed in section 3.3, furfural is an important bio-based platform chemical and can react with other low-molecular-weight chemicals to produce C8-C23 biofuels with the presence of noble metal loaded niobium catalysts. Jing et al. reported that the production of branched alkyl-cyclohexanes (product (A) in Fig. 1) from furfural and 2,4-pentanedione through a two-step process: (1) aldol condensation and Robinson annulation and (2) hydrodeoxygenation over Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst [195]. The yield of C15 oxygenates obtained from step (1) and C11- C15 alkyl-cyclohexanes obtained from step (2) can reach 89.8 % and 76.4 %, respectively [195]. Jing et al. also developed a three-step process, i.e. (1) aldol condensation, (2) Michael addition, and (3) hydrodeoxygenation, for catalytic converting furfural to liquid C18 -C23 branched fuels (product (B) and (C) in Fig. 1 [196]. Furthermore, NbOPO4 was demonstrated to be a better support in comparison with H-ZSM-5 and Al2O3, and Pd was found to be a preferred metal sits on NbOPO4 for hydrogenation [196]. The two-step process developed by Sreekumar et al. aims to produce biofuels (products (D) in Fig. 1) from furfural and alcohols via dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling and hydrodeoxygenation sequence utilizing Pt/NbOPO4 catalyst, and the yield of biofuel, a mixture of cyclic and acyclic alkanes consisting of C8-C19, can reach 78 % [197]. Simplified production processes were also developed. Xia et al. developed a one-pot process for the selective production of diesel-range alkanes (product (E) in Fig. 2) from furfural and 2-methylfuran via combining hydroxyalkylation/alkylation condensation and hydrodeoxygenation with multifunctional metal/NbOPO4 catalysts (e.g. Pd/NbOPO4, Pt/NbOPO4, Ru/NbOPO4, Ni/NbOPO4) [105]. Similar as observed by Jing et al. [196], Pd/NbOPO4 exhibited the best catalytic performance and the total yield of diesel-range alkanes can reach 89.1 %, as Pd plays a multifunctional role in the reaction. The acid sites of NbOPO4 catalyzes the hydroxyalkylation/alkylation condensation and dehydration reaction, while Pd and NbOx species promote the H2 dissociation and hydrogenation, and the cleavage of C-O, respectively [105]. Xia et al. also reported the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation process of the aldol adducts with furfural and acetone over metal/NbOPO4 (Pd/ NbOPO4, Pt/ NbOPO4, Ru/ NbOPO4, Ni/NbOPO4), and a high yield of octane (product (F) in Fig. 1), 94 %, was obtained through the direct conversion process [198]. In addition, a catalytic system for one-pot production of 1-octanol (product (G) in Fig. 1) from biomass-derived furfural-acetone in water was developed by Xia et al. through sequential hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis over noble metal/NbOPO4 [76]. The 1-octanol yields were found to rely on the acid properties of the supports, and the Pd/NbOPO4 exhibited better catalytic activity than other catalysts investigated, including Pd/γ-Al2O3, Pd/H-Beta, and Pd/Nb2O5 [76]. Furfural has also been employed for synthesizing renewable lubricant alkanes (product (H) in Fig. 1) with acetone through a tandem four-step process: (1) aldol condensation, (2) selective hydrogenation of the aldol product, (3) second aldol condensation, and (4) hydrodeoxygenation [199]. A series of supported Pd catalysts were evaluated in step (2) and their catalytic performance is in the order of Pd/γ-Al2O3 > Pd/C > Pd/NbOPO4 > Pd/ZrO2 > Pd/SiO2. Pd/NbOPO4 was utilized in step (4) and the yield of C23 alkanes reaches 84.8 % from C23 oxygenate obtained from step (3) [199]. Similar to the furfural, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) was also applied for biofuel production through a three-step process: (1) hydrolysis to produce 2,5-hexanedione, (2) base-catalyzed intramolecular aldol condensation to form 3-methylcyclopent-2-enone (MCP); and (3) hydrogenation of MCP over Pt/NbOPO4 to methyl-cyclopentane (product (I) in Fig. 1) [77]. In step (3), MCP was first hydrogenated to 3-methyl-cyclopentanol over Pt, and the 3-methyl-cyclopentanol obtained then undergoes dehydration over the acidic sites of NbOPO4 to form alkene, which was further converted to methyl-cyclopentane through hydrogenation over Pt [77]. 6.1.2 Hydrogenation of C5/C6 carbohydrates Noble metal loaded Nb catalysts have also been applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of biomass-derived xylose and sorbitol (route 7 in Fig. 1) [200]. Sorbitol is usually obtained from the catalytic reduction of glucose. Wang et al. developed a one-pot conversion process of xylose to produce 1,2-pentanediol (route 16 in Fig. 1) using Ru/C and NbOPO4 as the catalyst for hydrogenation and acid, respectively [79]. The combined yield of 1,2-pentanediol and 1-hydroxyl-2-pentanone can reach 21−27% in a water-γ-valerolactone/cyclohexane bi-phasic system [79]. NbOPO4 catalysts with high Lewis acidity were found to promote the formation of 1,2-pentanediol and 1-hydroxyl-2- pentanone instead of xylitol, as the presence of Lewis acid sites results in a lowered activation energy, from 53.9 kJ/mol to 48.7 kJ/mol, for xylose dehydration [79]. West et al. developed a process through the aqueous-phase dehydration and hydrogenation of sorbitol over Pt/phosphated niobic acid catalyst to generate alkanes (route 9 in Fig. 1), and achieved over 50 % conversion yield [201]. The Pt/phosphated niobic acid catalyst was found to exhibit better reactivity in comparison with silica–alumina based catalyst, owing to the coordination environment of the niobium acid center [201]. The performance of a series of metal-loaded catalysts was evaluated for converting sorbitol to hexane in an aqueous medium, and Pt/NbOPO4 exhibited the best catalytic activity with a C6 and C5 alkanes yield of 60 % [80]. The catalytic performance of these NbOPO4 supported catalysts is in the order of Pt > Pd > Rh > Ru > Ir > Ni; and NbOPO4 was demonstrated to be a better support in comparison with H-ZSM-5, H-Beta, Nb2O5, and Al2O3 [80]."
14,Catalytic hydrogenation of lignin,"6.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of lignin Lignin, a three-dimensional polymer of aromatic compounds, is the most energy-dense fraction of biomass. Many methods have been developed to produce biofuels from lignin, and catalytic hydrogenation is one of the most widely utilized methods [2,10,202–205]. Nb-based bifunctional catalysts have been demonstrated to be efficient for hydrogenation of aromatic model compounds, lignin oligomers, and raw lignin to produce biofuels (entries 12–18, Table 4), and the major products are aromatics and cycloalkanes (routes 19 and 20 in Fig. 1). 6.2.1 Lignin model compounds Various lignin model compounds were employed for catalytic hydrodeoxygenation study. The catalytic performance of three catalysts, i.e. Pd/SiO2, Pd/Nb2O5, and Pd/NbOPO4, was evaluated in the vapor phase hydrodeoxygenation process with m-cresol, anisole, and guaiacol model compounds, respectively, and Nb-supported catalysts exhibited better deoxygenation performance owing to the presence of oxophilic sites with Nb4+/Nb5+ cations [82]. The yields of aromatics and olefins were higher than that of alkanes when Pd/Nb2O5 and Pd/NbOPO4 was used [82]. Ru/Nb2O5-SiO2 catalyst also showed good catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation process of lignin model compounds to produce aromatics, resulting from the synergistic effect between NbOx species and Ru particles, i.e. NbOx and Ru promote the CO bond cleavage and transfer of hydrogen, respectively [83]. Similar to Ru/Nb2O5-SiO2, Ru/NbOPO4 also exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the hydrodeoxygenation of aromatic ethers, phenols, and real bio-oil, and the hydrocarbon yield can reach 88.2 % [103]. 6.2.2 Lignin oligomers Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst was employed for hydrogenolysis of lignin-derived oligomers; and the molecular weight of the oligomers decreased from 1434 to 878 Da and the HHV increased from 20.1–26.2 MJ kg−1 afterward [206]. Pd/NbOPO4 was also utilized for hydroprocessing of bio-oil comprised of lignin oligomers in alcohol, after which the HHV of the bio-oil increased from 26.96 to 40.48 MJ kg−1 and the oxygen content decreased from 29.53 to 9.78 % [86]. This mainly results from the simultaneous occurrence of aryl ether bond cleavage with dehydration, esterification, etherification, acetalization, and hydrogenation reactions [86,206]. Meanwhile, NbOx on the catalyst promote the breakage of COC bonds of the oligomers to small molecules, which was further hydrogenated over Pd to targeted products [206]. 6.2.3 Raw lignin In general, direct catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of raw lignin is challenging due to the high-molecular-weight and complex structure of lignin. Ru/NbOPO4, however, exhibited excellent catalytic performance on the cleavage of both interunit CC and CO bonds, yielding 124 %–153 % of monocyclic hydrocarbons through hydrodeoxygenation [85]. This originates from the combination of strong adsorption and synergistic effects among Ru, NbOx, and acid sites on the catalyst surface [85]. The catalytic performance of Ru/NbOPO4 and product distributions highly depends on the size of Ru nanoparticles (NPs), and Ru/NbOPO4 with smaller diameters of Ru NPs (1.2 and 1.8 nm) is usually more active in the cleavage of Caliphatic O and Caromatic O bonds [84]."
15,Catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose,"6.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose Cellulose, the most abundant fraction of biomass, has been regarded as a promising material for producing biofuels and value-added chemicals [1,207–209]. Catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose over niobium-based bifunctional catalysts to produce sorbitol, isosorbide, and ethylene glycol has been widely investigated (entries 19 and 20 in Table 4; routes 7–9 in Fig. 1). For instance, Ru/NbOPO4 was utilized for direct conversion of cellulose into sorbitol in water solution, for which NbOPO4 promotes the conversion of cellulose to glucose via hydrolysis and Ru catalyzed the glucose generated into sorbitol via hydrogenation [87]. As the NbOPO4 catalyst is with a high fraction of acid, it is desirable for sorbitol production and the yield of sorbitol can reach 69 % [87]. Based on this process, a two-step sequential process on the conversion of cellulose to isosorbide was developed, i.e. (1) cellulose hydrolysis–hydrogenation over Ru/NbOPO4, and (2) conversion of sorbitol and sorbitan to isosorbide over NbOPO4. The pH value of the initial solution for NbOPO4 preparation has significant impacts on its properties, and the catalytic performance is in the order of NbOPO4 (pH = 2) > NbOPO4 (pH = 7) > H-ZSM-5 > Al2O3 > NbOPO4 (pH = 10) > SiO2 [51]. NbOPO4 prepared at a low pH (= 2) exhibited the best catalytic performance and the yield of isosorbide reaches 56.7 % [51]. Different from the reaction in aqueous solution, catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose in methanol over Ru/NbOPO4 led to the production of ethylene glycol and its monoether derivative, via cleavage of a CC bond and hydrogenation catalyzed by NbOPO4 and Ru particles, respectively [88]. The total yield of ethylene glycol and its monoether derivative reaches 54.5 % at 220 °C with Ru/NbOPO4 catalyst, and this value increased to 64 % when Ru-Ni/NbOPO4 catalyst was employed [88]."
16,Catalytic hydrogenation of vegetable oils,"6.4 Catalytic hydrogenation of vegetable oils Vegetable oils are a good source for producing long-chain hydrocarbons via catalytic hydrogenation. In the presence of Pd/NbOPO4, near quantitative carbon yields of diesel-range alkanes were achieved from the hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides at 180 °C and 30 bar [90]. The reactions preserve CC bond cleavage, and high selectivity of > 96 % were obtained for n-alkane and propane from fatty acid and glycerol moieties, respectively. The superior hydrodeoxygenation activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of Pd and strong Lewis acidity of NbOPO4 [90]. Moreover, NbOPO4 can be used for catalytic deoxygenation without noble metals at high temperatures [89]. Scaldaferri and Pasa reported the production of hydrocarbons through one-step hydroprocessing of soybean oil over NbOPO4 at 350 °C, and the hydrocarbon obtained can be further separated by distillation to obtain renewable jet fuel, diesel, and gasoline (route 22 in Fig. 1) [89]. NbOPO4 can simultaneously promote the isomerization, cyclization, and dehydrogenation reactions in this process owing to its special acid and redox characteristics [89]."
17,Catalytic hydrogenation of raw biomass,"6.5 Catalytic hydrogenation of raw biomass The direct conversion of raw lignocellulose biomass to fuels is very attractive, even though there are many obstacles associated with the complexity of the raw biomass. Noble metal/NbOPO4 have exhibited good catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of raw biomass. For instance, a three-tandem-step process for producing diesel-range isoparaffins from corncob was developed: (1) production of furfural and isopropyl levulinate from corncob in toluene/water biphasic system with added isopropanol, (2) double aldol condensation of furfural to C15 oxygenates, and (3) hydrodeoxygenation of oxygenates into isoparaffins (product (J) in Fig. 1) [78]. Pd/NbOPO4 was selected as the catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation of C15 oxygenates, and the isoparaffin yield reached 97.0 % when the reaction was conducted at 220 °C for 24 h [78]. In addition, the direct hydrodeoxygenation process of raw woods was also developed for producing paraffins (route 28, and product (K) in Fig. 1) in cyclohexane over Pt/NbOPO4, and the yield of paraffins can reach 28.1 % wt [91]. The Pt/NbOPO4 catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance in this process, as it enables simultaneous conversion of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the wood sawdust to hexane, pentane, and alkylcyclohexanes [91]. This one-pot approach has the two advantages: (1) eliminating chemical pretreatment or separation of the raw woody biomass, and (2) simplified downstream separation by using alkane solvent [91]. Furthermore, Galletti et al. reported the production of gamma-valerolactone (GVL) from water slurries of giant reed by adopting bifunctional (acid and hydrogenating) catalytic systems based on Ru/C and niobium acid or NbOPO4 (route 1–5 in Fig. 1) [81]. NbOPO4 were found to have better performance in comparison with niobium acid, and an up to 16.6 %wt yield of GVL was obtained."
18,Computational studies for the catalytic origin of Nb-based catalysts,"6.6 Computational studies for the catalytic origin of Nb-based catalysts Quantum chemistry calculations were performed to study the reaction mechanism of NbOPO4, especially the mechanism of cleavage of CO and CC bonds. The impacts of Pd/NbOPO4 on catalytic conversion of aldol adducts of furans were investigated based on density function theory (DFT) calculation, and the results indicate that NbONb chains in both NbOx and NbOPO4 are capable of breaking the CO bond on the (tetrahydro) furan ring through relieving the surface tension of the oxide bonding network [198]. DFT analysis also demonstrated the presence of step and edge sites in smaller Ru particles of Ru/NbOPO4, which can significantly lower the barriers for cleavage of both Caromatic O and Caliphatic O bonds in the hydrogenolysis process of β-O-4 lignin model compound [84]. Xia et al. analyzed the conversion process of 1-butanol over NbOPO4, and found that the high catalytic activity of NbOPO4 can be ascribed to the better adsorption capability of surface Nb5c and lowered activation barrier comparing to Re2O7 [91]. Moreover, NbOPO4 has a strong binding ability due to its special electronic structure, which facilitates the deoxygenation reaction [91]. Dong et al. employed the combined inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and DFT analysis and demonstrated the strong adsorption of biphenyl on the surface of Ru/NbOPO4 with preferred orientation, activation, and hydrogenolysis, which promote to crack the interunit CC bonds of lignin dimer models [85]. Meanwhile, Zhuang et al. found that the effective catalytic deoxygenation of butyric acid over Nb2O5 results from the multifunctional Nb2O5(001) surface, which promotes the dissociative adsorption of reactants through the special Lewis acidity sites and the stress release on the surface with Nb-O-Nb chain [210]."
19,Oxidation,"Nb2O5 or Nb2O5 supported metal catalysts were also applied for oxidation reactions, e.g. methanol oxidation, ammoxidation [99], owing to their high selectivity and reusability. Nb-based catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the oxidation of biomass-derivatives, e.g. glycerol and HMF (see Table 5)."
20,Catalytic oxidation,"7.1 Catalytic oxidation Nb-supported metal catalysts were utilized for the oxidation reaction of glycerol to produce glyceric acid using O2 as the oxidant (route 26 in Fig. 1). Musialska et al. [92] and Sobczak et al. [93] found that Au/Nb2O5 is slightly less active in comparison with Au/C and commercial Au/TiO2 catalysts, but more active than Au/Al2O3, Au/V2O5, and Au/Ta2O5, and more selective in producing glyceric acid. In comparison with the Al, the Nb exhibited better dispersing ability and easier generation of active oxygen on the supported gold catalysts [87]. The Nb2O5 crystal exhibited better catalytic performance in comparison with the amorphous Nb2O5 when used as support [93]. The amorphous Nb2O5, however, can be directly utilized for generating glycolic acid (route 27 in Fig. 1) from glycerol without requiring to load other metal catalysts when H2O2 was used as the oxidant, as the direct contact of amorphous Nb2O5 with hydrogen peroxide enables the formation of radical peroxo species, a source of active oxygen for oxidation reaction [94]. Although the Nb2O5 crystal does not interact with hydrogen peroxide and form radical peroxo species [94], it can be used for epoxidation of soybean oil (route 24 in Fig. 1), and the Nb content is the key impacting factor on the catalytic activity [95]. Overall, the catalysts with a high Nb content has higher catalytic activity for the conversion of soybean oil, but low selectivity to the epoxide products, owing to the presence of more strong Brønsted acid sites, which promotes the opening of ring epoxide by hydrolysis [95]."
21,Photocatalytic oxidation,"7.2 Photocatalytic oxidation Although Nb2O5 is a typical transition metal oxide semiconductor, it was also utilized as a photo-catalyst owing to its better stability, and excellent surface and optical properties [211,212]. For biomass conversion, Nb2O5 was mainly used for photocatalytic oxidation of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran (route 6 in Fig. 1), which is a monomer of furan-based biopolymers and an intermediate of antifungal agents [213,214]. HMF can be converted to 2,5-diformylfuran over Nb2O5 (obtained from the calcination of niobic acid at 800 °C) under visible light, and the selectivity can reach 90.6 % with the presence of O2 and benzotrifluoride as a solvent [96]. Nb2O5, however, exhibits poor light absorption in the visible-light region and has a relatively low photocatalytic activity in oxidizing alcohols, as the bandgap energy of Nb2O5 is >3.2 eV [96]. Thus, a series of hybrid catalysts, including Nb2O5/TiO2 [198], Nb2O5/g-C3N4 [203], Nb2O5/ZnO2 [204], was developed to improve the photocatalytic activity of Nb2O5. Wang et al. prepared a bifunctional ZnIn2S4/Nb2O5 photocatalyst by growing Nb2O5 nanospheres on ZnIn2S4 microspheres [97]. The ZnIn2S4/Nb2O5 catalyst obtained exhibited improved performance for H2 evolution and oxidation of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran; the selectivity reaches 88.3 %. As the conversion of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran is mainly attributed to the selective oxidation of the alcoholic hydroxyl group to the carbonyl group (shown in Fig. 3 A), an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism on photo-oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds over Nb2O5 is needed. Furukawa et al. found that the Nb2O5/TiO2 catalysts exhibited improved selectivity than TiO2 for photo-oxidation of alcohols, owing to capable of prohibiting the formation of O3 − through covering the TiO2 surface with Nb2O5, as O3 − usually leads to over oxidation of organic compounds [211]. Zhang et al. reported that OH and O 2 − are not the major free radicals for the photo-oxidation of HMF over Nb2O5, and the dominant free radical is h+ [96]. In contrast to the typical catalytic mechanism (i.e. electron transfer) over semiconductor photo-catalysis, Shishido et al. proposed a rational photo-activation mechanism of alcohol (or alcoholic hydroxyl group) over Nb2O5 (shown in Fig. 3B) [215]. The reaction routes mainly include four steps [215]: (a) adsorption of alcohol (or alcoholic hydroxyl group) to form alcoholate species, which reduces the bandgap energy and promotes the selective oxidation under visible light irradiation; (b) activation of alcoholate by transferring an electron to the conduction band with reduction of Nb5+ to Nb4+ and leaving a hole on the alcoholate; (c) conversion of the alkenyl radical formed to carbonyl compound; (d) reoxidation of Nb4+to Nb5+ by molecular oxygen after desorption of the carbonyl compounds formed, which is also the rate-determining step."
22,Conclusion and prospects,"In summary, Nb-based catalysts have been broadly employed for catalytic conversion of biomass, including producing platform chemicals, biofuel, and value-added chemicals, and exhibited superior catalytic performance in various thermochemical conversion processes, including the hydrolysis, dehydration, pyrolysis, esterification, hydrogenation, and oxidation. The role and catalytic mechanism of the Nb-based catalysts in these reactions, however, vary. Their catalytic activities in routine hydrolysis, dehydration, pyrolysis, and esterification reactions are mainly attributed to the acid (Brönsted and Lewis acid) properties, whereas niobium mainly serves as a support for loading of noble metals (e.g. Pt and Pd) in the hydrogenation reaction. The performances of niobium support are mainly reflected by the good adsorption capability and the ability to break the CO and/or CC bonds with the assistance of special Nb-O-Nb chains. For oxidation reaction, the catalytic activities of niobium are mainly associated with its good dispersing ability to metals (e.g. Au) and effectiveness in promoting the formation of active oxygen. Note that the h + plays a crucial role in photocatalytic oxidation of HMF over Nb2O5, which is different from the reaction mechanism over the normal oxide semiconductor. The Nb-based catalysts have exhibited a wide range of applications in the field of biomass conversion, and three special advantages of Nb-based catalysts are summarized below. (1) Nb-based catalysts can preserve their catalytic performance in polar solvents and under high temperature and are good candidates for various types of thermochemical conversion in the solvent system. (2) Nb-based catalysts possess both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites, and the total acidity and the ratio of Brönsted to Lewis acid sites are controllable, which is essential for biomass conversion, especially the conversion of cellulose to HMF via one-pot reaction. (3) Nb has good compatibility with noble metals, and the noble metals/Nb exhibits synergistic effects in the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation process. The combination of noble metals and Nb enables the multistep complex biomass conversion. As Nb-based catalysts play an essential role in biomass conversion, especially in the production of platform chemicals and biofuels, five brief viewpoints for future research are proposed based on the recent research progress,. (1) Only limited works reported that raw biomass can be directly degraded to biofuels over Nb-based catalysts in the past few decades; most works focused on the conversion of model compounds or low-molecular-weight platform chemicals. More and in-depth investigations on the degradation of raw biomass materials and on biomass pyrolysis over Nb-based catalysts are definitely indispensable. (2) In the biomass catalytic conversion reactions (e.g. production of HMF and LA), the type, fraction, and strength of acids (Lewis and Brønsted acids, and their ratio), are essential factors. Future framework work on the design and synthesis of Nb-based catalysts with optimized acid properties and a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism of these Nb-based solid acids on catalytic biomass conversion are inevitable. (3) The modification and upgrading of Nb2O5 and niobic acid and development of multifunctional Nb containing alloy catalysts acid should be conducted to improve its catalytic activity. (4) Although Nb2O5 has been widely employed for photo-catalysis, only limited studies have been performed on the photocatalytic oxidation of biomass. As biomass photo-catalysis has been regarded as a promising technology in the next few decades, studies on the application of Nb2O5 are crucial, especially on the conversion of biomass over modified Nb2O5 via the combined acid catalysis and photo-catalysis. (5) Manufacturing Nb-based catalysts through an environmental-friendly and cost-effective process is imperative to realize the commercialized conversion of biomass and to meet future industry demand."
