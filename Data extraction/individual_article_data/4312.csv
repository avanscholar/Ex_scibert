0,Introduction,"Liquid transportation fuels for modern society are mostly derived from diminishing fossil fuel sources such as petroleum and coal due to much higher consumption rate than that of natural regeneration generally taken about millions of years [1,2]. Moreover, a large amount of CO2 and soot can be formed during the utilization of these fossil fuels by combustion. Notably, the production of liquid transportation fuels from petroleum requires complicated chemical refining processes and therefore large amount of waste residues was inevitable. These should be responsible for growing global warming and grave environmental pollution problems. However, the production of liquid fuels derived from biomass resources has been considered to be environmentally benign because of its neatness and less CO2 emission [3,4]. In addition, biomass is the only renewable source of organic carbon on the earth [5,6], and has a wide application in the production of liquid biofuels (e.g., methanol, ethanol or bio-oils) [7–10,3,11,12] due to its abundance of raw materials and relatively simple operation processes. Recently, particular interest has been attracted on creating new liquid fuel mainly composed of liquid alkanes ranging from C5 to C6 by aqueous phase reforming of biomass-derived sugars or sugar alcohols such as sorbitol [13–17], wherein a key challenge was present on the hydrodeoxygenation of these biomass-derived species. In the process, a bifunctional metal–acid catalyst (e.g., Pt/SiO2–Al2O3) was used to fulfill the scission of C–O bonds in the oxygenated molecules on the acid centers and followed by successive hydrogenation and reforming into liquid alkanes (C5–C6) on the metal centers. And it should be noted that the scission of C–C bond occurred to a great extent on the Pt metal sites to generate the undesirable byproducts such as lighter alkanes (C1–C4) under the reaction condition of 245°C and 2.93MPa, and thereby caused a decrease in the formation of liquid hydrocarbons [17]. In this regard, supported Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts were developed to take the place of those noble ones, but HZSM-5 zeolite showed stronger Brønsted acidity, leading to the heavier formation of coke and poor stability under severe hydrothermal conditions of aqueous phase reforming [18,19]. It has been stated that acid amount of HZSM-5 can be adjusted by dealumination of the framework Al of the catalyst under different calcination temperature, which facilitates aqueous phase processing of sorbitol conversion to liquid alkanes [18]. In addition, the framework Al of HZSM-5 can be substituted by nonpolar Si groups in a certain extent and thus would result in the acid modulation of the zeolite. MCM-41 mesoporous silica, firstly reported in 1992, has been confirmed to adjust the amount of Brønsted acidity of other zeolite such as MCM-22 because of its containing Lewis acidic sites [20]. Furthermore, such MCM-41 materials were widely used in catalysis owing to their high hydrothermal stability, large surface area and controllable mesoporous diameter [21,22]. MCM-41 was also found to improve effectively the adsorption capacity of the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and adjust the acidity of the catalyst and thereby facilitate sorbitol conversion to alkanes [23]. Here, to better understand the catalytic behavior and promoting effect of MCM-41 for sorbitol hydrogenation in water, meanwhile, to evaluate the potential application of the resulted catalyst in the substitution of fossil fuels with new liquid fuels from biomass, the selected catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) on the structure properties and reducibility. The variation in the acid distribution of the catalyst was also investigated by infrared spectroscopy using pyridine as probe molecule (Py-IR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) to distinguish the scission of C–C or C–O bond in the sorbitol molecule during the reaction. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis measurements (TG–DSC) of the used catalysts were adopted to investigate the behavior of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalyst used in this work was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. Prior to the preparation, appropriate amount of HZSM-5 (80–100 mesh, Si/Al atomic ratio of 38) was separately blended with different amounts of pure silica MCM-41 (100–120 mesh) in batches in deionized water at room temperature for 3h under the stirring speed of 300rmin−1, followed by drying in air at 110°C for 12h, and the dried samples were calcined at 500°C for 6h, then the resulting HZSM-5 composite precursors were formed and simply denoted as HZSM-5(x), where x refers to the weight percent of MCM-41 in the corresponding HZSM-5 composite and equals to 30, 40, 50 and 60, respectively. Subsequently, appropriate amount of each abovementioned HZSM-5 composite precursor was impregnated solely in an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate at room temperature for 12h, dried in air at 110°C overnight, and thereafter calcined at 500°C for 4h, the resulting catalysts were denoted as 2%Ni/HZSM-5(30), 2%Ni/HZSM-5(40), 2%Ni/HZSM-5(50), and 2%Ni/HZSM-5(60), respectively. For comparison, pure HZSM-5 and MCM-41 were also used to prepare 2%Ni/HZSM-5 and 2%Ni/MCM-41 catalysts according to the aforementioned process, respectively. HZSM-5 and pure silica MCM-41 were supplied by Nankai University catalyst Co., Ltd., (Tianjin, China), and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (AR, 99.9%) was bought from Tianjin Fucheng Reagents (Tianjin, China). All of the catalysts were reduced by a flow of H2 (30mlmin−1) at 500°C for 3h before reaction."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a Panalytical X’pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα (k =0.154nm) radiation at 40kV and 30mA. For the wide-angle XRD, the 2θ angles were scanned from 5 to 80° with a step of 0.016°, whereas for the small-angle XRD, the 2θ angles were scanned from 0.5° to 8° with a step of 0.02°. Infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption (Py-IR) were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. The samples were pressed into a self-supported wafer and treated at 400°C in an in situ IR cell for 0.5h followed by cooling to 50 or 100°C under vacuum to record the background spectra of the cell and the catalyst wafer. Subsequently, the samples were exposed to pyridine vapor for 10min and then vacuum evacuated at the same temperature in order to remove physical adsorbed pyridine. The spectra were recorded in the range of 1700–1400cm−1 with 32 scans and a resolution of 4cm−1. Infrared spectra (FT-IR) were collected on the abovementioned Thermo Nicolet Nexus FT-IR spectrometer. The samples were pressed into a self-supported wafer at room temperature using KBr and treated at 100°C in an in situ IR cell for 0.5h under vacuum and then cooled down to room temperature. The spectra were recorded in the range of 3000–4000cm−1 with 32 scans and a resolution of 4cm−1. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out on a self-made instrument. Typically, in order to remove the surface contaminants, 50mg of the sample loaded in a quartz reactor was firstly pretreated at 350°C in a pure N2 stream for 1h. After cooling to room temperature, a flow of 5%H2/N2 (25mlmin−1) was introduced into the sample, and the temperature was raised to 750°C at a heating rate of 10°C·min−1. The H2 consumption was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) equipped with a 5A molecular sieve column to remove H2O from the effluent gas. Thermal analysis curves (TG–DSC) of the catalysts were obtained by STA409PC from 40°C to 900°C at the heating rate of 15°C·min−1 under air condition."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test The activity test of the catalyst was carried out in a batch-type autoclave reactor with a capacity of 250ml. Typically, 9.1g of sorbitol and 3.0g of the reduced catalyst were filled in the reactor with 150ml of deionized water per run. The reactor was purged in advance with H2 for three times so as to remove oxygen contained in the reactor, and then the reaction was performed at 240°C and 4.0MPa for 1h under the stirring speed of 200rmin−1. The effluent products were measured via a wet flowmeter and analyzed by a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph (SE-30 capillary column, 30m×0.32mm×0.32μm) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion and alkane selectivity were measured by the definition formulas listed below: (1) Sorbitol conversion % = Sorbitol m - Sorbitol residue Sorbitol m × 100 (2) Alkane selectivity % = i × n C i ∑ i = 1 6 i × n C i × 100 In the formulas (2), i is the carbon atom numbers for alkanes; Ci is the alkane which contains carbon atom numbers of i."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural changes in the support,"3.1 Structural changes in the support Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of HZSM-5 samples added with different amount of MCM-41. Sharp diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ =7.9°, 8.9° and 22–25° were observed over the bare HZSM-5 sample, indicating the highly crystalline structure of HZSM-5 [24]. However, the intensities of these characteristic diffraction peaks decrease significantly as the amount of MCM-41 added up to 60wt%. This implies that the framework Al in HZSM-5 may be substituted partially by Si species in pure silica MCM-41. It was also noticeable that the characteristic diffraction peaks of HZSM-5 still occurred during the process of MCM-41 addition. For the MCM-41 sample, a broad diffraction peak appearing at 2θ =20–30° associating with SiO2 was also observed. Seen from the patterns of small angle XRD of samples (Fig. 2 ), an intense diffraction peak at 2θ =2.3° can be detected over pure silica MCM-41, which can be associated with (100) reflection, and two other weak peaks at 2θ =3.8° and 4.6°, respectively, which can be attributed to the corresponding higher order (110) and (200) reflections, indicating a typical well-ordered hexagonal structure of MCM-41 [25]. The typical XRD diffraction peak of MCM-41 at 2θ =2.3° occurs over HZSM-5(30), indicating that the framework Al of HZSM-5 could be partially substituted by Si species when a certain amount of pure silica MCM-41 was added. Moreover, the intensities of these three (100), (110) and (200) reflections generally increased with the increasing amount of MCM-41 addition in the range of 30–60wt%. The unit cell parameters of HZSM-5 with different amount of MCM-41 addition are listed in Table 1 . Interestingly, the remarkable decrease in the intensity of the (100) reflection peak can be observed in HZSM-5(40) in comparison with that in HZSM-5(30), indicating that a stronger interaction between HZSM-5 and MCM-41 occurred when 40% of MCM-41 was incorporated in HZSM-5. Thus, it can be speculated the optimal molecular structure was obtained in the HZSM-5(40) due to its smaller value of unit cell parameter a 0. This effect may play an important role in the improvement of the stability or activity of the resulting catalyst."
7,Acidity modulation in the support,"3.2 Acidity modulation in the support The acidity of HZSM-5 with different amounts of MCM-41 addition was measured by Py-IR spectroscopy and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . IR bands at 1450, 1595 and 1612cm−1 were observed over HZSM-5, which can be attributed to the adsorption of pyridine coordinated on Lewis acid sites [26]. IR bands near at 1545 and 1637cm−1 are associated with pyridine adsorption on Brønsted acid sites, which are generally assigned to the framework Al. In addition, the band at 1490cm−1 is ascribed to the vibration of the pyridine ring on Brønsted and Lewis acid sites [27,28]. However, pure silica MCM-41 exhibits only two strong bands at 1446 and 1595cm−1 and a weak band at 1490cm−1 after pyridine chemsorption, indicating that Brønsted acid sites can be negligible and Lewis acid sites are the dominant acid centers in MCM-41 due to the absence of the framework Al. Interestingly, the intensity of Brønsted acid sites in HZSM-5 decreased sharply when small amount of MCM-41 was added to HZSM-5, such as 30wt%, while that of Lewis acid sites increased distinctly. Meanwhile, the band arising from Lewis acid sites at 1450cm−1 shifted to 1446cm−1, indicating that there occurs an interaction between HZSM-5 and MCM-41 added and therefore causes the increase in the amount of pyridine adsorbed due to the increase in the intensity of these sites. Generally, hydrodeoxygenation of C–O in the sorbitol molecule was mainly carried out on the weak acid sites, while the strong acid ones were used for C–C breakage to generate lighter alkanes by successive hydrogenation. Thus, the appropriate amount of total acid sites and Lewis acid sites can easily result in the production of liquid alkanes from sorbitol hydrogenation on the Ni/HZSM-5 composites. This is proven by the results of activity tests and Py-IR over 2%Ni/HZSM-5(40). In addition, the intensity of Lewis acid sites decreased gradually with the amount of MCM-41 added beyond 40wt%, implying that an optimum proportion between HZSM-5 and MCM-41 may exist in the framework of the HZSM-5 composites. To investigate the strength of Lewis acid sites estimated by the stability of chemisorbed pyridine on HZSM-5(40), IR spectra after evacuation at various temperatures were collected under the different temperature and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . It is clear that the intensity of IR bands at 1446 and 1595cm−1 decreased significantly with the increasing evacuation temperature in the range of 50–200°C. Moreover, IR band at 1595cm−1 disappeared when the evacuation temperature was elevated to 250°C, following by a broaden peak occurred near 1612cm−1, indicating that the HZSM-5(40) sample still contains a certain amount of Lewis acid sites under higher temperature. This also is the evidence that the resulting catalyst prepared from HZSM-5(40) exhibits higher catalytic activity for C–O hydrodeoxygenation in the sorbitol molecule by aqueous phase processing under the harsh hydrothermal reaction condition. However, the intensities of the peaks of Lewis acid sites were quite low as evacuation temperature further increased up to 400°C, indicating that pyridine interacts weakly with these Lewis acid sites under high temperature and results in the negligible acidity. Additionally, FTIR spectroscopy was adopted to further investigate the variety of surface hydroxyl groups between MCM-41 and HZSM-5, and the spectra collected at room temperature in the vibration band rang of 3000–4000cm−1 (O–H stretching region) are presented in Fig. 5 . The band at 3618cm−1 was observed over bare HZSM-5, which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of surface Al–OH groups in the HZSM-5 framework [29]. For the MCM-41 sample, one band at about 3727cm−1 was detected distinctly, which can be associated with terminal Si–OH groups [30]. Notably, Al–OH groups in HZSM-5 are generally recognized as strong Brønsted acid sites, while those Si–OH groups are weak Lewis acid sites. As an appropriate amount of MCM-41 was added to HZSM-5 (e.g., 30wt%), the initial band at 3618cm−1 in HZSM-5 disappeared completely, and a new band at 3733cm−1 occurred. In addition, the intensity of this peak increased with increasing amount of MCM-41 addition in the range of 30–60wt%, implying a visible increase in the amount of surface hydroxyl groups. Compared to MCM-41, the peak shift from 3727cm−1 to 3733cm−1 indicates that an interaction between MCM-41 and HZSM-5 exists and that Al–OH groups in HZSM-5 can be substituted partially by Si species and then formed Si–OH, Si–O–Si or Si–OH–Al groups after calcined at 500°C for 3h, accompanying by the adjustment of the types and amount of acidic sites of HZSM-5 and subsequently resulting in the easy formation of heavier liquid alkanes from sorbitol hydrogenation."
8,Hydrogen reducibility of the catalyst,"3.3 Hydrogen reducibility of the catalyst Fig. 6 shows the H2-TPR profiles of 2%Ni/HZSM-5 with different amount of MCM-41 addition. Two reduction peaks can be detected over 2%Ni/HZSM-5, one at 349°C ascribed to the reduction of superficial NiO, and the other at higher temperature (426°C) attributed to the reduction of bulk NiO [31], which were both lower than those over 10%Ni/HZSM-5 reported in our previous study [18], indicating that Ni species are much easily reduced by hydrogen under the lower level of nickel loading due to its better dispersion on the surface of HZSM-5. Compared to 2%Ni/HZSM-5, higher temperature of the reduction peak of NiO was observed over 2% Ni/MCM-41, and the temperature of both reduction peaks was found to be around 408 and 637°C, respectively, suggesting a stronger interaction between NiO and MCM-41 due to its higher surface area and bigger adsorption capacity demonstrated by N2 physical adsorption in our previous study [23]. Moreover, a shift to higher temperature of the reduction peak of NiO can be also found over 2%Ni/HZSM-5 with small amount of MCM-41 addition. The temperature of both reduction peaks was shifted to higher temperature by 13 and 82°C, respectively when the amount of MCM-41 was added in the range from 30 to 40wt%, indicating that appropriate amount of MCM-41 can significantly promote the interaction between NiO and the support. Interestingly, the temperature of the reduction of superficial NiO was found to be around 398°C over 2%Ni/HZSM-5(50), while that of the reduction of bulk NiO maintained unchanged, which was shifted to 534°C when the amount of MCM-41 was added up to 60wt%. This indicates that NiO species are relatively difficult to be reduced under higher amount of MCM-41 added. This is also the evidence that the reduction of NiO species was carried out initially from the superficial phase."
9,Sorbitol hydrogenation,"3.4 Sorbitol hydrogenation Fig. 7 shows the catalytic performance of 2%Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of MCM-41 addition for sorbitol hydrogenation. It can be seen that 2%Ni/HZSM-5 exhibited a low catalytic activity of sorbitol hydrogenation with sorbitol conversion of 40%, and the selectivity of liquid alkanes (pentane and hexane) was only 35.6%, wherein a larger amount of lighter alkanes (C1–C4) was formed with the total selectivity of 64.4%, indicating that the scission of C–C bond was carried out to a great extent on the surface of HZSM-5 due to its strong acidity, which has been demonstrated by Zhang et al. [18]. Meanwhile, a lower conversion of sorbitol was found to be 16.3% over 2%Ni/MCM-41, implying that the hydrogenation of C–O or C–C bond was difficult to accomplish on the pure silica MCM-41 containing only weak acidic sites, but the selectivity of pentane and hexane was both higher than those over 2%Ni/HZSM-5, accompanying by a clear decrease in the selectivity of lighter alkanes. Interestingly, the product of sorbitol hydrogenation was completely dominated by hexane with the selectivity of 91.4% when 30wt% of MCM-41 was added to the catalyst, although the sorbitol conversion was relatively unchanged in the process. In addition, 2%Ni/HZSM-5(40) exhibited the maximum activity with 67.1% of sorbitol conversion and 98.7% of liquid alkanes selectivity and then decreased as a function of MCM-41 addition in the range of 40–60wt%, wherein the selectivity of hexane maintained at 90–94%, which was higher than those obtained on the Pt-based catalysts [13,17]. Notably, the catalytic performance for the reaction on the used 2%Ni/HZSM-5(40) catalyst was found to be a bit less than that on the fresh one. These mean that proper amount of MCM-41 addition to 2%Ni/HZSM-5 can enhance remarkably sorbitol to convert into heavier liquid alkanes (C5–C6), and thus a promoting effect of MCM-41 can be deduced on the product selectivity, which may be due to a positive interaction between HZSM-5 and MCM-41 based on the abovementioned results of characterization techniques."
10,Carbon deposition resistance of the catalyst,"3.5 Carbon deposition resistance of the catalyst In order to explore the carbon deposition behavior of the used Ni/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5(40) catalyst, the samples were investigated by using TG technique, and TG–DSC curves are shown in Fig. 8 . As seen from Fig. 8a, the used Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst had a serious weight loss of 27%, which was found to be much higher than that for the used Ni/HZSM-5(40) catalyst with a value of 8%. Moreover, two exothermic peaks were observed from Fig. 8b over these two catalysts, indicating that two types of different carbon species deposited on the catalyst surface. The peak at the region of 200–400°C can be attributed to the combustion of the amorphous carbon, while the one at the region of 400–650°C can be associated with graphitic species [32]. In addition, the heat release of two peaks over the used Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was both much higher than that over the Ni/HZSM-5(40) catalyst, especially the peak at high temperature. This means that carbon deposition on the former was more serious than the latter, that is, 40wt% of MCM-41 embedded into HZSM-5 can greatly restrain the formation of carbon deposition on the surface of the catalyst. Notably, no obvious change can be detected on the exothermic peak value over these two used catalysts, suggesting that MCM-41 added does not affect the types of carbon species while only decreases their generation amount. Moreover, the adjustment of Brønsted acid concentration in Ni/HZSM-5 by 40wt% of MCM-41 addition based on the abovementioned results of Py-IR should be responsible for the decrease of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, it can be speculated that graphitic species formed during the reaction may be one of main factors of deactivation for Ni/HZSM-5 due to its difficult transformation and covering the active sites and blocking HZSM-5 channels."
11,Conclusions,"Liquid alkanes such as C5–C6 alkanes can be selectively produced from sorbitol hydrogenation via modifying the structure of the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and its types of acidic sites in water medium in the present study. An appropriate amount of MCM-41 addition to the 2%Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was found to significantly enhance the activity of the catalyst for sorbitol hydrogenation into C5–C6 alkanes. The catalyst containing 40wt% MCM-41 exhibited the maximal sorbitol conversion of 67.1% and the liquid alkane selectivity of 98.7%. As the amount of MCM-41 addition was further increased to 60wt%, the sorbitol conversion decreased distinctly to 41.8%, whereas the hexane selectivity maintained at about 90%, indicating that MCM-41 added favors the scission of C–O bond in the sorbitol molecule. The characterization results of XRD, IR and Py-IR techniques showed that the addition of 40wt% MCM-41 to Ni/HZSM-5 would result in the optimum structural properties and visible increase in the amount of Lewis acid sites of the catalyst, which favor the scission of C–O in the sorbitol molecule into heavier C5–C6 alkanes by successive hydrogenation in water. The results of H2-TPR analysis revealed that a strong interaction between Ni species and the support existed over the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst contained appropriate amount of MCM-41. Meanwhile, TG–DSC experiments displayed that MCM-41 added can greatly restrain carbon deposition on the surface of the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst under the harsh hydrothermal condition. These roles might give some insights for better understanding the catalytic behavior of MCM-41 on the catalyst for sorbitol hydrogenation, and it however should be noted that the structure of the catalyst may be changed in water medium. Detailed studies are still required to design and improve a more robust catalyst for biomass conversion by adding some stabilizers or promoters in the future."
