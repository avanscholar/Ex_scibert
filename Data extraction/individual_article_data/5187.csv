0,Introduction,"Semiconductor photocatalytic hydrogen production has attracted immense attention since it has been served as the most prospective approach to converse solar power into green chemical power in a feasible way [1–5]. So, there exists a serious requirement to seek a visible-light active photocatalytic system with efficient solar energy conversion. However, photocatalysts cannot be used in industrial applications, due to their poor visible light utilization and inefficient quantum yield [6]. Compared with the single semiconductor photocatalyst, the multiple components photocatalysts have been exploited to regulate band structure and improve electron-hole separation rate [7,8]. But, traditional two semiconductors heterojunctions, which weakened redox capacity of photo-induced carriers, failure of the high oxido-reduction potential of H+/H2 for H2 evolution [9]. Fortunately, a large number of researchers have found that the construction of all solid semiconductor-metal-semiconductor (S-MS) based Z-scheme heterostructures by using noble metal materials as electronic transfer media can effectively overcome the above problems, such as g-C3N4/Au/CdS, g-C3N4/Au/CdZnS, g-C3N4/Au/C-TiO2, g-C3N4/Au/BiOCl. And Xingang Li used et al. used a ferroelectric-BaTiO3/Au/g-C3N4 as photocatalyst that degraded rhodamine B (RhB) and H2 evolution in aqueous solution under simulate solar light irradiation with a photocatalytic ability superior to the single-component photocatalyst [10–14]. These Z-scheme heterostructures could not only maintain outstanding redox ability but also accelerate light-generated carrier separation by an oxidation-reduction shuttle or electron intermediate, which is conducive to improving photocatalytic performance [15–19]. However, traditional S-M-S based Z-scheme systems often met issues of poor interfacial contact and mismatch of electronic structure, which gave birth to lower interfacial charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, it is a great interest for developing the suitable semiconductor materials to construct the Z-scheme heterojunctions for enhancing photocatalytic properties by modulating the interfacial charge kinetics. Among extensive investigation of a good deal of photocatalysts, g-C3N4 has been considered a potential material for producing hydrogen under visible light since it has an appropriate band gap (~2.7 eV) and an enough reduction ability [20,21]. Nevertheless, it still suffers from limited absorption of visible light (λ <470 nm) as well as high recombination rate of photo-produced carriers [22]. Since photocatalytic reaction occurs at semiconductor surfaces, higher surface to volume ratios often predict more surface active sites and the subsequent improved photocatalytic activity. Porous g-C3N4 with high surface area often possesses abundant surface functional groups [23], which provide more opportunities to couple with other semiconductors, enabling it as ideal supporting material for constructing heterostructural photocatalysts [24]. Therefore, it is worthy to modify and develop feasible semiconductor photocatalytic materials to establish the above Z-scheme heterojunction with g-C3N4 to optimize photocatalytic property. Due to the monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) possesses suitable band edge location and high oxidation capability, it is desired to achieve spatial charge separation and enhance photocatalytic performance via matching g-C3N4 with BiVO4 to form the Z-type junction using an electron mediator [25,26]. Generally, noble metal nanoparticles, such as Au, Ag and Pt, are recognized as an effective class of electron mediator, which could work on the interface of semiconductor materials to separate the photoelectrons and holes quickly in space. Meanwhile, the noble metals can harvest a broadened spectrum of solar absorption on account of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, which could promote photocatalytic activity [27,28]. Undoubtedly, Au is more advantageous in extending the absorption of visible light [29]. Therefore, it is much vital to investigate the Z-system mechanism consisted of g-C3N4 with BiVO4 using Au nanoparticles as an electron shuttle to improve the photocatalytic activity. Hereby, Z-scheme heterostructure g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 photocatalysts were built by loading Au nanoparticles to regulate the interfacial charge transfer between BiVO4 and porous g-C3N4. Hydrogen evolution was used as a model to tailor the interfacial charge kinetics and the SPR effect of Au under visible light."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of porous g-C3N4 All the reagents were analytically pure without further purification and water was ultra-pure in the experiment. Typically, melamine (3 g) was dispersed by 50 mL deionized water and stirred for 30 min at ambient environment. Then, the suspension was reacted in an oven at 180 °C for 24 h via a 100 mL Teflon lined stainless steel kettle. After natural cooling, the precursor was collected by vacuum filtration with H2O, and then dried overnight at 60 °C. Finally, the g-C3N4 sample was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. It was marked as CN. 2.1.2 Preparation of Au/g-C3N4 First, 0.3 g of the prepared g-C3N4 was accurately weighed and dispersed in 20 mL deionized water. Second, a certain amount of chloroauric acid solution with Au concentration of 5 g L−1 was added, which was 0.12, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.6 mL, respectively. Meanwhile, 5 mL of methanol were added. Then, the mixture suspension was stirred at room temperature for 8 h and then was dried at 60 °C for 10 h. After grinding, the precursors presented different light yellow. Finally, the precursors were calcined at 400 °C for 3 h to obtain the samples of Au/g-C3N4 were obtained, which the quality scores of Au were 0.2 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, 4 wt% and 6 wt%, respectively, and were marked as 0.2AuCN, 0.5AuCN, 1AuCN, 2AuCN, 4AuCN and 6AuCN. 2.1.3 Synthesis of BiVO4 In a traditional method, 0.01 mol Bi (NO3)3·5H2O and 0.01 mol of NH4VO3 was dissolved in 20 mL nitric acid (2 M) to form solution A and 10 mL NaOH solution (2 M) to form solution B, respectively. Then, the solution B was added to solution A drop by drop under intense agitation to obtain a stable suspension. The resulting suspension was transferred to 100 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclaves. The reaction temperature was kept at 180 °C for 12 h. Finally, it was cleaned with H2O and ethanol four times alternately, and then stoved at 60 °C to obtain yellow powders of BiVO4. 2.1.4 Formation of the Z-scheme photocatalyst of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 First, g-C3N4 of different masses (0.05 g, 0.15 g, 0.25 g, 0.35 g, 0.45 g) and BiVO4 (0.45 g, 0.35 g, 0.25 g, 0.15 g, 0.05 g) were mixed well. Then, the mixture was calcined and the temperature was kept at 400 °C for 4 h to obtain two-phase composite g-C3N4/BiVO4 with mass ratios of 9:1, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 1:9, which were marked as 9C1B, 7C3B, 5C5B, 3C7B, and 1C9B, respectively. Finally, g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4, which the quality scores of Au was 4 wt%, was synthesized in the same way that was used to synthesize the Au/g-C3N4."
3,Photoelectrochemistry studies,"2.2 Photoelectrochemistry studies Metrohm Autolab AUT302N electrochemical workstation was used to carry out the electrochemical test. The three-electrode cell electrochemical workstation includes working electrode, the counter electrode (Pt wire) and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl). 10 mg photocatalyst was confected into turbid liquid with conducting binder that was made up of 100 μL C2H5OH and 20 μL Nafion from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. The suspension was ultrasonic-assisting for 30 min and vigorous stirring for 12 h. Then, the suspension was spun and coated on glass electrode (FTO glass 1 × 1 cm) and dried at 60 °C for 30 min for the working electrode. Every part of the cell was filled with the same stock of electrolyte solution with an original concentration of 0.2 M of Na2SO4 (pH = 7). The electrolyte was purged with high purity N2 for 10 min prior to use. N2 gas was gently flowed on top of the electrolyte interface during measurements. The illumination source was a LED lamp (LDCNW-White (Neutral), 4100 K, 700 Ma, 690 lm, 10 mW·cm−2). The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the photocathodes was counted by using the J-V curves with an assumption of 100% Faradaic efficiency, according to the flowing equation: ABPE % = I × 1.23 − ∣ Vb ∣ P × 100 % where I is the photocurrent density (mA·cm2), Vb is the potential versus ideal counter electrode (V), and P is the incident illumination intensity (mW·cm2)."
4,Photocatalytic experiment,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiment Photocatalytic performances of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated by H2 production in triethanolamine solution in absence of any cocatalyst. Photocatalytic water splitting was performed in a quartz container with cover. For H2 evolution, 50 mg catalyst was diffused in a mixed solution of 20 mL triethanolamine and 80 mL ultrapure water in the flask to form a mixture. Before light, the reaction system was cleansed with Ar gas and withdrawn many times by a vacuum pump to guarantee the reactor in a vacuum condition as far as possible. Then the mixed liquor was stirred and irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm) without any cocatalyst. The H2 evolution speed was recorded by an online gas chromatograph (GC2014C, TCD) and Ar was used as the carrier. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 was calculated under different monochromatic light irradiation provided by a 300 W Xe lamp. The λ values were 420, 450, 475, 500, 550 and 600 nm and the average incident light intensities were measured to be 20.0, 12.5, 11.7, 11.1, 7.9 and 10.5 mW·cm−2 by an irradiatometer (CELNP2000, Beijing CEAULIGHT), and the irradiation area was 24.6 cm2.Following the equation below: AQE % = 2 × number of evolved H 2 molecules number of incident photons × 100 % = 2 × N 1 N 2 × 100 % N 1 = 6.02 × 10 23 × H 2 mol / t s N 2 = A cm 2 × I W · cm − 2 × λ nm / 6.626 × 10 − 34 × 3.0 × 10 8"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and morphology analyses,"3.1 Structure and morphology analyses The super-thin porous g-C3N4 was prepared and bulk g-C3N4 was also synthesized for comparison (S1). The XRD patterns (Fig. 1a) show that bulk g-C3N4 showed two stronger peaks at 27.2° and 13.0°, whereas the porous g-C3N4 exhibited only one weakened diffraction peak at 27.2°, corresponding to (002) plane, which is the characteristic of interlayer structural packing units [30]. Moreover, on the basis of SEM and TEM observations, bulk g-C3N4 (Fig. 1b–e) shows a large thick layer structure. In contrast, the porous g-C3N4 possesses porous structure (Fig. 1f, g) with an ultrathin layer (Fig. 1h, i). The thickness of porous g-C3N4 is verified to be approximately <4 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and height profiles (Fig. 1j–l), and it shows that bulk g-C3N4 was composed of multiple layers with a total thickness of >12 nm (Fig. 1m–o). The super-thin porous structure of g-C3N4 inspires us to explore its detailed pore volume, pore size and BET surface area information. The N2 sorption isotherms for bulk and porous g-C3N4 were classified both as IV-type isotherms. (Fig. S1). The porous g-C3N4 possesses higher BET surface area (58.42 m2/g) than that of bulk g-C3N4 (11.29 m2/g) with an average pore diameter of 22.27 nm (Fig. S2), and its pore volume is up to 0.325 cm3/g (Table S1). Higher surface to volume ratio often predicts more active sites and the subsequent improved photocatalytic activity. Thereby, the ultra-thin porous g-C3N4 was selected as the target in the following investigation. Compared to pristine porous g-C3N4, with the increase of Au loaded content, four additional featured peaks of Au in Au/g-C3N4 samples are observed and become stronger gradually at 38.17°, 44.37°, 64.55° and 77.54° (JCPDS No. 006–2933). Consequently, the intensity of g-C3N4 peaks is depressed (Fig. S3), which ascribed to the poor crystallinity of g-C3N4 and the good crystallinity and large size of Au nanoparticles. For BiVO4, all characteristic peaks could be well attributed to the signal monoclinic BiVO4 phase (JCPDS Card No. 75-1866) (Fig. S4). Furthermore, the crystalline phase of BiVO4 showed no apparent alteration with the coexistence of g-C3N4 and Au nanoparticles in the g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 composite, confirming that the three-phase system formed (Figs. S5 and 2a). Furthermore, the SEM images (Figs. S6–7) indicate that a series of composite catalysts were successfully synthesized. The TEM images (Fig. 2b–d) reveal that g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 catalyst was synthesized successfully, and its three components touch each other, being beneficial to transfer the photogenerated charges among three components [31]. BiVO4 is irregular with large particle size, while Au is ellipsoid particles of about 100 nm and g-C3N4 shows thin nanosheet feature. The HRTEM images (Fig. 2e, f) show that BiVO4 have ordered lattice fringes with the lattice spacings of 0.289 and 0.468 nm, which correspond to the (004) and (011) planes, respectively, closing to the lattice parameters of monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS Card No. 75–1866). The lattice spacings of Au elemental are measured to be about 0.233 and 0.235 nm respectively, corresponding to the (111) plane. The element mapping analyses (Fig. 2g–n) also show Au nanoparticles and BiVO4 were loaded on g-C3N4 nanosheets, which is consistent with the X-ray energy spectrum (EDS) result (Fig. S8). What's more, it can be observed that the BET surface area, pore size and pore volume of the Au modified g-C3N4 and BiVO4 composite were larger than that of BiVO4 but smaller than that of porous g-C3N4 (Fig. S9 and Table S2). All the above characterization analyses demonstrate g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 three-phase samples were synthesized. FT-IR analysis was further performed to verify the composition and surface structure of the catalysts (Fig. S10). The wide absorption peaks of all samples at 3350 cm−1 is due to surface vibration of hydration [1]. For BiVO4, the absorption peak at 742 cm−1 is attributable to the ν3 asymmetric expansion vibration of VO4 functional groups [32,33]. The peaks located at 800–1700 cm−1 are assignable to the typical stretching vibration modes of the aromatic CN and CN heterocycles, and the sharp absorption peak at 807 cm−1 belongs to the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units [34,35]. For g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4, no significant influence could be observed, indicating that the introduction of Au didn't change the initial chemical structure of g-C3N4 and BiVO4. XPS technique was used to characterize the surface chemical environment and oxidation state of the prepared samples (Fig. 3 ). There exists C, N, Bi, V, O and Au six main elements in agreement with the above results. The Bi 4f spectra exhibit two contributions, 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 at respectively 163.9 and 158.7 eV (Fig. 3a), which can be vested in the Bi3+ of BiVO4 [36]. The V 2p spectra (Fig. 3b) clearly evidence the presence of two chemical surroundings for V atoms, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 located at 524.3 and 527.1 eV, respectively [37]. Fig. 3c shows two binding energy peaks of C 1s, 288.1 and 284.7 eV belonging to sp2 hybridization and CC bond, respectively [38]. In Fig. 3d, the N 1s peaks consist of three chemical environments at 404.4, 400.5 and 398.6 eV, which are ascribed to charge effect, CNH and CNC, respectively [39–41]. For the peaks of O 1s, as presented in Fig. 3e, the binding energy of 529.5 eV is considered to be the BiO bond in the (Bi2O2)2+ layer of BiVO4, the signal peak at 532.3 eV is the OH bond of surface adsorption water and 530.8 eV should be the carboxyl oxygen in the compound [42]. In Fig. 3f, the two characteristic peaks at 88.2 and 84.5 eV of Au are respectively ascribed to Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2 of metallic Au0, however, the binding energy of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 moved up by 0.5 eV compared with that of general metallic Au. These results maybe because there is a stronger Au-g-C3N4 interaction in g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 [43,44]."
7,Optical properties and band structure,"3.2 Optical properties and band structure In general, the photocatalytic performance and interfacial charge transfer kinetics are relevant to photo-response ability as well as the electronic structure of the semiconductor heterojunctions. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of all catalysts were measured and depicted in Fig. 4 . It can be observed from Fig. 4a that porous g-C3N4 displays an absorption band edge near about 470 nm and pristine BiVO4 exhibits an electronic absorption edge at 525 nm. According to the Tauc plot (Fig. 4b), the bandgap energy of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 was determined to be 2.70 eV and 2.44 eV, respectively [45,46]. Interestingly, Au nanoparticles modification can lead to an absorption shoulder from 500 nm to 650 nm for Au/g-C3N4 samples, which centered at about 580 nm. This absorption is likely to be ascribed to the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles (Fig. S11). Moreover, g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 heterojunctions (Fig. S12) also exhibited an apparently characteristic absorption peak centering at 580 nm in comparison to g-C3N4/BiVO4 (Fig. S13), confirming the SPR of Au nanoparticles could immensely extend the visible-light absorption region and improve visible light driven catalytic activity [44,47,48]. In addition, Fig. 4c illustrates the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of porous g-C3N4 and BiVO4. Hence, the valence band maximum of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 was determined to be 6.08 and 7.37 eV versus vacuum level, which was calculated by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectra from the excitation energy (21.22 eV) [49]. Having the results of band gap energies and valence band edge positions, the electronic band structures versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) can be determined as shown in Fig. 4d. Obviously, a zigzag type of electronic structure of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 occurred. And it's suspected that a Z-scheme interfacial charge transfer is probably to occur using Au as electron shuttle, predicting improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance."
8,Evaluation of photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution,"3.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the photocatalytic properties of the catalysts were tested through H2 production in triethanolamine solution in absence of any cocatalyst. Obviously, the mean rate of hydrogen production of pristine g-C3N4 is about 2.2 μmol g−1 h−1. After the modification of Au on porous g-C3N4, the photocatalytic H2 production activity was markedly enhanced with the optimal H2 evolution rate of 244.6 μmol g−1 h−1 for 4Au/g-C3N4 sample, which is attributed to the improvement of charge separation efficiency between Au and g-C3N4 as well as he SPR effect of Au nanoparticles (Fig. S14) [50]. However, the photocatalytic activity showed no distinct increase with Au content from 0.2% to 4%, which might due to the non-uniform and irregular growth and aggregation of Au nanoparticles during the synthesis process, leading to the non-orderly increase trend of specific surface area, thus making irregular H2 production performance, as shown in the nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves of Au/CN samples (Fig. S15). In Fig. S16, all g-C3N4/BiVO4 heterojunctions exhibit promoted activities and the g-C3N4/1BiVO4 (9C1B sample) shows much higher H2 production speed (23.3 μmol g−1 h−1). By Au nanoparticle anchoring, the H2 production rate of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 was greatly promoted with optimal H2 evolution rate of 410.0 μmol g−1 h−1 for 9CAu1B sample (Fig. S17). On the basis of electronic structure of g-C3N4 and BiVO4, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 is related to the fact that Au nanoparticles act as electron mediator to transform the interfacial charge migration way of type II g-C3N4/BiVO4 junction to Z-scheme type. Fig. S18 also presents the H2 production properties of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 under visible light in absence of any sacrifice agent, which demonstrating its potentiality. The activity of 9CAu1B was also tested by H2 evolution at different single-wavelength excitation (Fig. S19) and its AQE was counted to be 6.8% at λ = 420 nm and 1.1% at λ = 600 nm (Fig. 5b). The results showed that the absorption of Au at the characteristic wavelength of SPR had an effect on its catalytic activity, which was consistent with the data of UV–vis DRS. Meanwhile, it is obviously that the AQE values of 9CAu1B photocatalyst were compatible to that of other photocatalysts from many references in Table S3, but still lower than partial values. Moreover, to fully explore the real role of Au in the photocatalytic reaction, we supplemented the hydrogen production experiments of Au and Au/BiVO4 as illustrated in Fig. S20. It can be found that visible light driven hydrogen production can be achieved by Au although the hydrogen yield is quiet low. Since the conduction band minimum is more positive than that of the standard hydrogen electrode, BiVO4 is unable to produce hydrogen under visible light irradiation. After the junction of BiVO4 with Au, the hydrogen production capacity of Au/BiVO4 was depressed. This observation may be originated from the fact that partial hot electrons of Au inspired by SPR effect may inject to BiVO4, resulting in the reduction of redox potential as well as the hydrogen production yield. The results supposed that Au nanoparticles cannot only enhance the photoabsorption of catalyst by SPR effect, but also act as cocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic reaction process. Besides, the stability is equally essential to a catalyst and the recyclability of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 was examined (Fig. 5c). The photocatalytic activity was highly maintained even after 5 cycles for 50 h, suggesting that g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 is highly stable during the whole reaction. Simultaneously, the durability was also testified by measuring the XRD data and SEM images of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 before and after cyclic experiment. As indicated in Fig. 5d, the typical diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to the standard data (JCPDS Card No. 75-1866) of BiVO4 and no apparent change was observed except that the crystallinity of BiVO4 weakened in compare to that before photocatalytic test. Moreover, it can be seen that the morphology of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 remains basically unchanged before (Fig. S7) and after (Fig. S21) the reaction."
9,Photochemical property,"3.4 Photochemical property To clarify the carrier migration kinetics and photo-response of the g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 junction, a sequence of photoelectrochemical tests were performed under white light LED irradiation. The photocurrent response plots of the prepared samples were presented in Fig. 6a. Clearly, g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 possesses the optimal photo-response than that of the other samples, which indicates that g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 can produce plentiful electrons and holes under visible light irradiation and make them separate and transfer rapidly [51]. The result was also testified by the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in Fig. 6b. The EIS plots correspond to the equivalent circuit, which were used to understand the conductivity of photocatalysts. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for the g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 sample is smallest about 39.8 KΩ, which further confirmed the improvement of the conductivity and instantaneous charge separation and migration rate of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 heterojunction and that maybe boost the photocatalytic activity [52]. The charge separation process can further be proved by photoluminescence spectra of the photocatalysts (Fig. S22). It can be observed that g-C3N4 displays strong visible light emission at the range of 400–700 nm. However, the intensity of emission weakened after the combination of BiVO4, being related to the fact that photoinduced electrons in g-C3N4 injected to BiVO4 and BiVO4 possesses low VV separation and efficient energy transfer from VO species to quenching centers [53]. On the other hand, the luminescence intensity of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 and Au/g-C3N4 was also significantly suppressed, indicated efficient energy and/or electron transfer from g-C3N4 across Au nanoparticles is probably to appear [54,55]. Thus, Au nanoparticles may serve as important medium in modulating the interfacial charge transfer process, due to the interfacial charge movement leads to the efficient charge separation [30]. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was also measured in Fig. 6c. Among the photocatalysts, the current density of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 is the highest and the photocurrent onset potential is 0.61 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in neutral electrolyte (0.2 M sodium sulfate solution, pH 7), which is 0.36 V and 0.22 V more positive than that of g-C3N4 and BiVO4, respectively. Besides, Tafel slope is also used for mirror the internal natures of electrocatalysts, which depends on the linear portions of the Tafel plots according to Tafel equation (Formula S1) [56–58]. As illustrated in Fig. S23, the smaller Tafel slope (197 mV/dec) of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 also reveals that the activation barriers were decreased, resulting to enhanced H2 production kinetics and performance [59]. The corresponding ABPE value of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 was achieved 0.65% (Fig. 6d). Accordingly, based on the analysis of all photoelectrochemical results, we can forecast that Au nanoparticles were likely to play a significant part in regulating interfacial charge migration as well as the absorption of visible light."
10,Underlying mechanism for highly improved photocatalytic performance,"3.5 Underlying mechanism for highly improved photocatalytic performance To further confirm the reaction mechanism as well as the impact of Au nanoparticles on interfacial charge transfer in depth, photodegradation of rhodamine B (Rh B) was performed to inquire into the dominating active species under visible light (Fig. S24). During the process, three typical radical species scavengers, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), ammonium oxalate (AO) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) were used for the detection of superoxide radical (O2 −), hole (h+) and hydroxyl radical (OH) [38,60]. As exhibited in Fig. 6a and b, all the three active species play certain role in the Rh B degradation. But, for g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4, the activity of photodegradation Rh B was dramatically reduced when the BQ was added, which indicating the major active species is O2 – (Fig. 7a). For g-C3N4/BiVO4, the primary active species is h+, closely followed by O2 – and OH (Fig. 7b). On account of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potential of g-C3N4 and BiVO4, the above results might disaccord with the type II interfacial charge process of g-C3N4/BiVO4. Another explanation is that the interfacial charge transfer between two semiconductor catalysts demonstrates low-efficiency. However, for g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4, the observation of this capture experiment could clarify that it is more capable to produce O2 – and OH active species than g-C3N4/BiVO4, since the participation of Au nanoparticles transform the interfacial charge movement to a Z-scheme way, thus gathering the electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 and keeping the holes on the VB of BiVO4. In order to further proved the results and prediction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was measured by DMPO spin-trapping technology with different visible-light irradiation time [26]. The EPR signal peaks of the DMPO-O2 – of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 increase markedly with the extension of illumination time (Fig. S25), so does that of g-C3N4/BiVO4 (Fig. S26), which suggests they possess the ability to generate O2 −. Significantly, the signals of DMPO-O2 – of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 are more apparent than that obtained of g-C3N4/BiVO4 upon illumination for 8 min (Fig. 7c). The EPR signal peaks of the DMPO-OH for g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 also gradually increase with the light of prolonged (Fig. S27) and it reaches highest upon illumination for 8 min (Fig. 7d). But, no obvious EPR signal peaks of hydroxyl radical was found for g-C3N4/BiVO4 in Fig. 7d, being in accordance with that observed in Fig. S28. As discussed above, the CB of g-C3N4 located at round −1.04 V vs NHE, being more negative than the potential of O2/O2 – (−0.33 eV vs NHE) [61]. And the VB of BiVO4 located at 2.73 V vs NHE, being more positive than that of OH−/OH (2.4 eV vs NHE) [62]. Therefore, the light-induced electrons are able to react with adsorption O2 to create O2 – on the CB of g-C3N4, and the holes are potential to transform OH– to OH on the VB of BiVO4. According to the trapping experiments and EPR test, greater ability of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 to produce superoxide active species means that it has stronger reduction capability and accumulates more photogenerated electrons on the CB of g-C3N4, which might give evidence of another way of interfacial charge transfer compared with g-C3N4/BiVO4. It was hypothesized to be a Z-scheme charge migration mechanism between g-C3N4 and BiVO4 in g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 by utilizing Au nanoparticles as electron mediator, which contributes to enhance the photocatalytic property. Combined all analysis of experimental results above, a reasonable Z-scheme photocatalytic pathway of g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 heterojunction is presented in Fig. 8 to account for the outstanding enhancement of photocatalytic property toward H2 production. Specifically, g-C3N4 and BiVO4 can generate photogenerated electrons and holes, when g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 is irradiated by visible light. Due to the Schottky barrier, the band energy at the interface was bent when the metal contacts to n-type semiconductor, and the band bending is different depending on the Fermi levels of metal and semiconductor materials [30]. The fermi level of Au (0.45 eV, versus NHE) [63] is lower than that of g-C3N4 (−0.475 eV, versus NHE) and is higher than that of BiVO4 (2.661 eV, versus NHE) [30]. Therefore, the energy band of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 was bent upwards and downwards, respectively. The electrons generated on the CB of BiVO4 will integrate rapidly with the holes on the VB of g-C3N4 by using Au nanoparticles at interfaces as electron shuttle. Simultaneously, the photo-produced electrons of Au nanoparticles will shift to the CB of g-C3N4 because of strong SPR effect of Au nanoparticles under certain wavelengths of light. It results that the g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 catalyst has stronger redox capability compared to g-C3N4/BiVO4 and photogenerated carriers are not easy to recombine. Consequently, the photo-induced electrons left and aggregated on the CB of g-C3N4, as well as holes on the VB of BiVO4 have enough ability to take part in the photocatalytic redox reaction and then immensely enhance its photocatalytic property."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a Z-scheme g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 photocatalysts were constructed to achieve excellent photocatalytic activities and optimal stability toward H2 production without any cocatalyst under vis-light irradiation through regulating the interface charge migration pathway. Mechanism research and a series of experimental data analyses show that the Z-scheme g-C3N4/Au/BiVO4 photocatalysts could greatly improve the charge separation efficiency and redox driving force by using Au nanoparticles as electron shuttle, which benefits for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Meanwhile, the SPR effect of the Au nanoparticle is beneficial to improve the visible light response and then also promote photocatalytic H2 production property. This work offers the facile insight into the explanation for ternary Z-scheme catalysts where Au not only serves as electron shuttle and cocatalyst but also absorbs visible to enhance the photocatalytic property of hydrogen evolution."
