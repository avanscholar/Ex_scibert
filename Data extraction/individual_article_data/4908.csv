0,Introduction,"Our society relies heavily on non-renewable fossil resources to produce liquid fuels and chemicals, which were consumed to improve the quality of people׳s lives and drive global economy forward. However, depleting fossil-based resources alongside environmental deterioration compels us to seek renewable and clean resources for the sustainable supply of fuels and chemicals. Biomass is defined as all plant and plant-derived materials including starch, sugar, oil crops and animal manure, which is the only current renewable resources on the Earth that can be converted to liquid fuels and chemicals to replace fossil-derived counterparts [1]. Small or no additional CO2 emission occurs during the production and utilization of bioenergy, easing or even eliminating negative impact on the carbon balance of our biosphere [2]. The estimated biomass production in the world is 1.70×1011 t per year by biosynthesis and composed of roughly 75% carbohydrates [3]. In the United States, the annual dry biomass potential is over 1.3×1010 t which can be used to produce biofuels to replace more than 30% of the country׳s current petroleum consumption [1]. It is also expected that bioenergy supplies 15% of global primary energy by 2050 [4,5]. Recently, scientists have put a lot of efforts to produce fuels and chemicals from biomass by chemcatalytic conversion routes or direct liquefaction which possess the advantage of high process efficiency as compared with conventional biological process [6–8]. For example, fuel ethanol is one of the present dominated commodities produced by the fermentation of biomass (mainly starch) in an industrial-scale which could be added into the regular gasoline to reduce the consumption of fossil resources in the U.S. and Brazil or elsewhere [9]. However, the current fuel ethanol industry is limited by its potential threat to food security and the “blend-wall” issues [10–12]. In this context, valorization of lignocellulosic biomass, the most abundantly available biomass resource, to “drop-in” biofuels is a better alternative avenue to ease our overwhelming dependence on nonrenewable fossil resources [13]. Such drop-in biofuels could directly be shipped into the existing fuel infrastructure without any changes as petroleum products, thus avoiding the requirement of special facilities for blending with regular gasoline. Converting lignocellulosic biomass to platform chemicals is envisaged as a key step to realize the above fascinating prospect.. Biomass-derived platform chemicals, such as levulinic acid (LA) [14], 5-hydroxymethyl (HMF) [15,16], furfural [17] and γ-valerolactone (GVL) [18], retain moderate functionalities to ensure the required stability for storage and transportation and the essential reactivity for upgrading to other chemicals and fuels as compared with that of carbohydrate. Recently, GVL has been hailed as a versatile biomass-derived platform molecule that can be used as a renewable carbon source for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals. Physicochemical properties of GVL were listed in Table 1. Many research efforts have recently been paid to the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to GVL. It is well-known that lignocellulose consists of cellulose (~45% of dry weight), hemicellulose (~30% of dry weight) and lignin (~25% of dry weight) [11]. Both cellulose and hemicellulose fractions could be used as the starting materials to produce GVL ( Fig. 1). Cellulose, a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of β-glycosidic bonds linked d-glucose units, could be degraded to glucose though chemical or enzymatic catalytic hydrolysis [19], and the isomerization of the resulting glucose to fructose would take place in the presence of acid catalysts [20]. Then, the dehydration of the latter occurred to form HMF (3 in Fig. 1), followed by rehydrating to LA (4 in Fig. 1) [20]. HMF and LA are also identified as useful biomass-derived platform molecules for producing liquid fuels and carbon-based chemicals from lignocellulosic materials [15,21]. In addition, cellulose or carbohydrates could be directly converted into alkyl levulinates (5 in Fig. 1) through alcoholysis in alcohols [22–26]. Finally, LA and its esters could be selectively reduced to GVL over various heterogeneous or homogeneous catalytic systems. As for hemicellulose (composing primarily of the pentose sugars), xylose is one of the main hydrolysates originating from hemicellulose and could be firstly degraded to furfural (1 in Fig. 1) catalyzed by mineral acid or solid acid [27]. The resulting furfural could be converted to furfuryl alcohol (FAL, 2 in Fig. 1) by catalytic hydrogenation [28], followed by the hydrolysis or alcoholysis of FAL to yield LA or its esters respectively [29–32]. Hence, LA and its esters could be produced from either cellulose or hemicellulose fraction though cascade reactions, and were subjected to the subsequent hydrogenation to GVL. In this review, advances in GVL production via selective reduction of commercial or biomass-derived LA and its esters using various hydrogen sources, mainly including molecule H2, formic acid (FA) and alcohols, have been systematically summarized. In addition, we also mainly emphasize here on employing GVL as a green solvent for biomass conversion and employing GVL as a precursor for the production of transport fuels."
1,Employing GVL as a solvent,"Horváth et al. [18] have firstly proposed that GVL is a promising sustainable liquid from biomass for the production of other carbon-based chemicals, because GVL has many advantages of renewability, non-toxicity, stability and biodegradability. Fegyverneki et al. [37] have also synthesized and characterized several GVL-derived chemicals that could be used as outstanding green solvents, including alkyl 4-alkoxyvalerate and GVL-derived ionic liquids. Recently, Strádi et al. [38] have surveyed the hydrogenation of olefins in GVL-based ionic liquids to obtain alkanes. The turnover frequency of the catalysts in GVL-based ionic liquids was found to be significantly higher than that in regular ionic liquids such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]) and the hydrogenation reaction was also found to be highly selective to the C=C double bonds even in the presence of other unsaturated functional groups. Interestingly, GVL itself is also an excellent solvent for the transformation of biomass into chemicals and fuels. Recently, Duan et al. [39] have reported that the synthesis of phosphatidylserine, a significant ingredient in functional food and pharmaceutical industries [40], was conducted with a 95% yield using GVL as solvent. Qi et al. [41] have demonstrated catalytic conversion of fructose, glucose and sucrose to HMF and LA in GVL/H2O mixture solution by tandem processes. Poor solubility of fructose in pure GVL (0.01g/100gGVL) was observed, which would be improved moderately by adding H2O and H2SO4. The maximum HMF yield of around 75% and LA yields ranged from 50% to 70% were obtained on the basis of the diversity of carbohydrates under the optimal reaction conditions. The resulting LA could be converted in-situ to GVL with a yield of 55% (based on fructose) using FA as hydrogen source in the presence of Shvo catalyst [42]. This catalytic strategy eliminates the separation of LA and opens a promising door to employ GVL as a solvent for the conversion of biomass to platform chemicals. Dumesic and co-workers have developed a biphasic system consisting of GVL and aqueous HCl solution saturated with NaCl to produce LA from cellulose [43]. The majority of LA (greater than 75%) derived from the degradation of cellulose in aqueous HCl solution shifted to GVL phase, facilitating a LA yield as high as 72%. Dumesic et al. have also tried to hydrogenate the resulting cellulose-derived LA to GVL over Ru–Sn/C in GVL phase. GVL and soluble humins were found having negative impact on the catalyst and resulted in a considerable decrease in the rate of LA conversion. Interestingly, all products formed by cellulose deconstruction are solubilized by GVL, avoiding the trouble of pipeline plugging usually caused by insoluble humins in a monophase system (aqueous). The dissolved humins could be precipitated and separated from GVL by dilution with a mass of water followed by filtration. However, the concentration and purification of LA and GVL from the resulting diluent must be an energy-intensive process, because significant quantities of water must be removed by distillation. The conversion of biomass to platform chemicals over heterogeneous catalysts is highly desirable, because heterogeneous catalysts can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction system. Unfortunately, poor water-solubility of biomass materials (such as cellulose) leads to a weak interaction between solid acid catalysts and feedstock in water, resulting in a poor LA yield but a high selectivity to by-products (humins). Alonso et al. [44] found that cellulose could be completely dissolved in GVL/H2O solution under the applied reaction conditions, improving its accessibility to active sites on the surface of solid catalysts. When the conversion of cellulose to LA was conducted in GVL/H2O (9/1, w/w), LA yield as high as 69% was achieved using Amberlyst 70 as the catalyst, in contrast, only a low LA yield of 20% was obtained in water under the same conditions. Apparently, the good solubility of cellulose in GVL/H2O mixture solution should be mainly responsible for this high LA yield over solid acid catalysts. Converting hemicellulose to furfural has also greatly promoted when GVL was used as the solvent. Gurbuz et al. [45] have recently demonstrated that the conversion of xylose into furfural with a high furfural yield of 81% at 175°C using solid acid catalyst in GVL/H2O (9/1, w/w). In contrast to net water reaction system, side-reactions between furfural and active intermediates derived from xylose were suppressed in GVL/H2O (9/1, w/w) system, namely, furfural was stable with a high yield in this GVL/H2O system. Most importantly, Gurbuz et al. found that C6-sugars (glucose and fructose) could degraded into furfural replacing HMF or LA as the main product in GVL/H2O solution. The furfural yield of 32% and 36% were obtained starting from glucose and fructose, respectively, which were the highest yield of furfural from hexose so far. But the mechanism of hexose to furfural is not very clear now and further study is essential to get more insight into this transformation. Zhang et al. [46] have also employed GVL as solvent to produce furfural from xylose, xylan and corncob catalyzed by FeCl3·6H2O. A surprisingly high furfural yield of 79.6% from untreated corncob was achieved at 185°C for 100min in GVL/H2O solution. Apparently, one can inferred that a fraction of cellulose in corncob was also converted to furfural in GVL/H2O solution. In view of exceptional performance of GVL as solvent, Alonso and co-workers have recently developed an attractive strategy for the conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose simultaneously into LA and furfural respectively, giving high yields in a single reactor using sulfuric acid as catalyst in GVL/H2O (9/1, w/w) solution [47]. The results suggested that a long retention time and high acid concentration lead to more furfural degradation, but facilitate the LA accumulation. Thus, varying reaction times and acid concentrations could selectively switched products between LA and furfural. This solvent system could be applied to the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass materials comprising of different cellulose and hemicellulose fractions into LA and/or furfural with high yields, respectively. Take corn stover for example, LA yield of 58% and furfural yield of 67% were achieved under the optimal reaction conditions. As compared with LA, furfural could be easily recovered from the reaction system by distillation as its high volatility, preventing the further degradation of furfural. Furfural could also be converted to LA by consecutive hydrogenation and hydrolysis processes (Fig. 1), followed by the reduction of the resulting LA to yield GVL in the GVL solvent. Lignin fraction and humins were dissolved into GVL and hindered greatly the subsequent selective hydrogenation of LA over solid catalysts. Although, lignin and solid humins could be precipitated from GVL by dilution with a mass of water and then be removed by filtration, the concentration of the resulting diluent to remove water is an energy-intensive process. Recently, a nonenzymatic sugar production approach was successfully developed using lignocellulosic materials (corn stover, hard wood and softwood) in a solvent mixture of GVL, H2O and dilute sulfuric acid [48]. In this report, Luterbacher and co-workers demonstrated that biomass feedstock was charged into a packed-bed flow-through reactor, and solvent was flowed through the biomass at a constant rate, while the reactor was heated from 430K to 490K with a prescribed linear temperature ramp. High yields of soluble carbohydrates ranged from 70% to 90% were obtained on the basis of the source of feedstock (corn stover, maple wood and loblolly pine). Aqueous phase enriched with the resulting carbohydrates was separated from GVL by liquid CO2 extraction [49]. The separated carbohydrates could further be upgraded to furans (HMF and furfural) by chemcatalytic process with a desirable yield or to ethanol by fermentation at high titers. As compared with H2O or ethanol/H2O solution, GVL/H2O solution reported here exhibited unparalleled performance for the deconstruction of lignocellulosic materials into soluble carbohydrates. The role of GVL for the increased deconstruction of biomass can be ascribed to complete solubilization of lignocellulosic materials in GVL/H2O solution and disruption of cellulose crystallinity by GVL, greatly improving accessibility to feedstock surface. In addition, GVL also has the potential to be used as the suitable solvent for the valorization of lignin or humins into high-valued chemicals and fuels because of favorable solubility of lignin and humins in GVL [5,50], but a few studies are concentrated on this issue to date."
2,GVL and its derivatives as fuel,"Recently, GVL is considered as a new renewable liquid for gasoline and diesel fuel oxygenate. Horváth et al. have concluded that GVL is a better alternative than ethanol as a fuel additive due to its lower vapor pressure and relatively higher energy content [18]. GVL does not form an azeotrope with water as compared with ethanol, which resulted in an energy-intensive concentration process to remove water during ethanol production by fermentation. Bruno et al. [51] have systematically characterized the mixtures of 91 AI summer quarter gasoline and GVL using the Advanced Distillation Curve methodology. The addition of GVL led to the distillation curve to lower temperatures for diesel fuel, but to higher temperatures for gasoline. The addition of GVL also significantly facilitated to reduce the concentration of CO and smoke in automobile exhaust [36], but phase separation appeared when high concentration of GVL was added. It is noted that some defects of high water solubility, smaller cetane number, and relatively lower energy density as compared with fossil-based fuels limit the application of GVL in the transportation sector (Table 1). In order to overcome above-mentioned weaknesses of GVL, increasing attentions have recently been paid to upgrade GVL to “true” liquid fuels by catalytic hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation. Methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) formed by catalytic hydrogenolysis of GVL is also regarded as a promising biofuel [18,52–54], because it could be blended up to 70% in gasoline and has an high octane number of 87 [6]. Lange et al. have also demonstrated a valeric biofuel strategy starting from cellulose that cellulose-derived GVL could converted into valeric acid though the ring opening and hydrogenation over Pt-zeolite followed by esterification of valeric acid to valerates as fuel additives (Fig. 2) [55–59]. Compared with ethanol, butanol and MTHF, valerates have a higher energy content and suitable polarity paralleled to conventional fuels. Moreover, the volatility-ignition properties of different valerates could be regulated by tuning their alkyl chain length to meet the requirement to be used as gasoline or diesel oxygenates. For example, regular gasoline blended with ethyl valerate (EV) at 10 and 20vol% still met the specification of European gasoline; however, heavier esters such as pentyl valerate (PV) were more suitable to be used as diesel due to its better volatility and cold-flow property. More practically, Lange et al. evaluated the performance of regular gasoline blended with 15vol% EV by a road trial based on ten vehicles with a cumulative distance of 250, 000km. No measurable impact on engine wear, oil degradation, vehicle durability, engine deposits, or regulated tailpipe emissions was observed when EV was added into gasoline. Compared with the strategy reported by Lange et al., Chan-Thaw et al. [60] recently described a one-pot approach to produce EV and PV with a high of 70% over inexpensive Cu/SiZr. However, it is infeasible to employ either MTHF or valerates to completely replace petroleum fuels in the transportation sector due to their relatively lower energy densities. Recently, Dumesic and co-workers have developed two attractive catalytic strategies for the conversion of GVL into liquid alkenes that can be directly used as transportation fuels [61,62]. In the first catalytic strategy ( Fig. 3), GVL in the aqueous firstly underwent ring opening to an isomeric mixture of unsaturated pentenoic acids, followed by decarboxylation to produce butene isomers with equimolar quantities of CO2. Dumesic et al. demonstrated that both of these transformations could be proceeded over SiO2/Al2O3 catalyst at elevated pressures in a fixed bed reactor (Fig. 3, Reactor 1) [63–65], and the butene yield as high as 98% was achieved under the optimal reaction conditions. The resulting butene in gas stream could be selectively converted to liquid C8+ alkenes in the presence of CO2 through oligomerization over solid acid catalysts (HZSM-5 or Amberlyst 10) in the second fixed bed reactor (Fig. 3, Reactor 2). Low molecular weight alkenes was also formed via cracking, but C8+ alkenes was the desired products that can be directly employed as jet fuel. In integrated catalytic system consisting of two flow reactors, the selectivity to C8+ alkenes from GVL was reached 77% under the optimal conditions. Noble metal catalysts and external hydrogen source were not required in this integrated system reported by Dumesic et al., minimizing production costs of alkene fuels from GVL. Further techno-economic analysis for this integrated catalytic strategy was also conducted and Dumesic et al. declared that the production of liquid fuels via this approach was superior to a lignocellulosic ethanol production strategy reported by NREL economically [66]. In the second catalytic strategy ( Fig. 4), GVL could be upgraded to C9 alkenes by progressive deoxygenation. Serrano-Ruiz et al. have recently developed a catalytic route for the conversion of GVL into 5-nonanone by cascade reactions in two continuous flow reactors [67,68]. Firstly, a synthetic aqueous streams of GVL (50 wt%) with H2 was fed into a fixed bed reactor loaded with Pd/Nb2O5 catalyst and the carbon selectivity toward pentanoic acid (PA) as high as 92% was achieved by the ring opening of GVL in the presence of H2SO4. Pd/Nb2O5 provided good hydrothermal stability and sulfur resistance property to ensure the ring-opening of GVL to PA under mineral acid and water environments. The resulting stream containing PA was consecutively fed into the second reactor charged with Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalyst and the carbon selectivity of 84% toward 5-nonanone was obtained [67,69]. Techno-economic analysis for the production of 5-nonanone from LA was also estimated as well [70]. Subsequently, 5-nonanone could be reduced to 5-nonanol over Ru/C catalysts. The latter underwent dehydration and isomerization over USY zeolite catalyst to produce a mixture of branched C9 alkenes with appropriate performances for the application in the transportation sector [61,68]. In addition to being used as solvent or precursor for liquid fuels, GVL is also widely employed in flavoring industry [71] and organic synthesis field [72–75], or used as feedstock for the formation of valeric acid [76,77], 1,4-pentanediol [52,78–80], amino compounds [81] and so on ( Fig. 5). Interestingly, Zhao et al. [82] have recently reported that the conversion of GVL into aromatic hydrocarbons through catalytic pyrolysis over various zeolites. Some research efforts have also been paid to convert GVL into monomers of polymer materials, and the resulting composites show outstanding thermostability, mainly attributing to robust five-membered ring structure originating from GVL [83–86]. GVL is recently identified as a renewable carbon source for the sustainable supply of chemicals, liquid fuels and polymer materials, however, the future role of GVL will strongly depend on its manufacturing costs from biomass. Therefore, more attentions should be paid to reduce the production cost of GVL from biomass resources through effective catalytic conversion routes."
3,The production of GVL from commercial/biomass-derived LA,"Generally, GVL directly formed via selective hydrogenation of commercial/biomass-derived LA under external hydrogen sources using various catalysts. In this review, advances in the production of GVL from commercial/biomass-derived LA via multiple catalytic systems have been detailedly summarized on the basis of the diversity of hydrogen sources. We mainly concentrate on the usage of external molecule H2, formic acid (FA) and alcohols as hydrogen sources and also assessed the relative merits of different hydrogen sources for the GVL production. The probable selective hydrogenation pathway of LA to GVL is shown in Fig. 6. In a liquid-phase hydrogenation route, 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (HPA) is confirmed as the intermediate through hydrogenation of the carbonyl group at C4 position of LA using various homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts [87–89]. HPA is regarded as a thermolabile compound which is rapidly converted to GVL via lactonization in the presence of acid catalysts [90]. In a gas-phase hydrogenation route, LA is prone to form α-angelica lactone (AAL) via enolization under elevated-temperature and the resulting AAL is subsequently reduced to the desired product GVL using H2 and catalysts [91,92]."
4,Using external molecular H2 as hydrogen source,"4.1 Using external molecular H2 as hydrogen source Molecular H2 is the most common hydrogen source for the reduction of unsaturated organic compounds due to its easy-separable feature in liquid reaction systems. Recently, various catalytic hydrogenation systems for GVL production have been successfully developed using commercial/biomass-derived LA and external molecular H2 as hydrogen source. Homogeneous catalytic systems for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL are summarized in Table 2. The story of homogeneous catalytic systems for GVL production could be trace back to 1991. Braca et al. [93] reported the conversion of carbohydrate-derived LA to GVL in the presence of ruthenium iodocarbonyl (Ru(CO)4I2) with HI or NaI as co-catalyst, and the overall GVL yield of 39.5% obtained starting from glucose. Starodubtseva et al. [94] demonstrated a RuII–BINAP–HCl catalytic system in which ethyl levulinate (EL) was converted to GVL with a yield of 95%. This catalytic system was also efficient (85% GVL yield) even under a very mild condition of 25°C and 18h. Ru(acac)3 with different ligands was also employed as catalysts for the selective reduction of LA, the maximum GVL yield of 95% or 100% was obtained in aqueous solution or solvent-free conditions, respectively [95]. Further, Kühn et al. have investigated the effect of various water soluble phosphine ligands on the catalytic activity of Ru species [96], indicating active Ru species were unstable at the absence of ligands under the applied reaction conditions. The significant role of phosphine ligands was also demonstrated by Tukacs and co-workers [97]. Biphasic system consisting of dichloromethane and water was also reported for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL using a water-soluble Ru-(TPPTS) catalyst [88]. After reaction, GVL and Ru-based catalyst dissolved into organic and aqueous phases respectively, facilitating the recycle of catalysts. Besides Ru-based catalysts, Ir was also be employed as the active metal for the hydrogenation of LA, archiving a high yield with TONs as high as 78,000 [98,99]. Compared with heterogeneous catalytic system, homogeneous catalytic system has a remarkable advantage in high TONs because of strong interaction between substrates and homogeneous catalysts. However, complicated expensive ligands and poor recoverability of homogeneous catalysts limit its applications in a commercial scale for GVL production. Given the above-mentioned shortcoming of homogeneous systems, heterogeneous catalytic systems containing effective recyclable supported catalysts are highly desirable for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. Recently, many research efforts have been paid to employ heterogeneous catalytic systems for the selective hydrogenation of LA using external molecular H2 and the corresponding advances are summarized in Table 3. The earliest records of heterogeneous catalytic systems for hydrogenating LA could be date back to 1930s [100]. The best GVL yield of 87% was achieved under room temperature with a duration of 44h using H2 (2.3–3.0bar) and PtO2. Raney Ni was also used as the catalyst for reduction of LA with approximately GVL yield of 90% under elevated temperature and H2 pressure [78,101]. Later in the 1950 s, Dunlop and Madden [102] have reported an effective gas-phase hydrogenation approach to produce GVL in a fixed bed reactor loaded with reduced CuO/Cr2O3 catalyst, giving a maximum GVL yield of 100% at 200°C with feed rates of 1.2g/min (LA) and 5L/min (H2). Broadbent et al. [103] have also demonstrated that a moderate GVL yield of 71% was obtained under solvent-free condition with H2 pressure of 150bar over Re2O7. Recently, Ru–Ni supported on ordered mesoporous carbon was prepared for the solvent-free hydrogenation of LA and gave an optimal GVL yield of 97% [104]. The excellent catalytic activity of this bimetallic catalyst was ascribed to the homogeneous embedding of Ru–Ni bimatallics in mesoporous carbonaceous matrix with strong metal-support interaction. Several noble-metal-free catalysts consisting of Cu/Cr/Fe/Ni were also employed for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL [105–108]. For instance, Hengne and co-workers [109] have accomplished a quantitative conversion of LA to GVL over nanocomposites of Cu–ZrO2 and Cu–Al2O3 in aqueous phase. Hengne et al. believed that acidity of the supports of ZrO2 and Al2O3 facilitated the dehydration of the intermediate 4-HPA to aim GVL. GVL yields of above 90% were obtained over these inexpensive catalysts, although severe reaction conditions involving high temperatures (>200°C) and H2 pressure were required. Recently, Ni–MoO x /C bimetallic catalyst was prepared and gave a maximum GVL yield of 97% under solvent-free and mild reaction conditions (8bar H2, 140°C, 5h) [110]. The better catalytic performance of Ni-MoOx/C as compared with other noble-metal-free catalysts was attributed to the co-presence of metallic Ni and partially reduced MoO2 species. Reduced Co3O4 also showed a favorable activity and stability for hydrogenating EL to GVL under a relatively reaction conditions [111]. Precious metal catalysts were confirmed having sufficient catalytic activity ensuring the hydrogenation of LA under relatively mild conditions. To date, Ru/Ir-based supported catalysts have been verified as most active catalysts for the reduction of LA to GVL in heterogeneous catalytic systems. Manzer et al. [84] concluded firstly that 5% Ru/C showed more catalytic activity as compared with other activated carbon supported catalysts (like 5% Pt/C) for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. The GVL yield was peaked at 97% under a moderate conditions of 150°C and 500 pisg H2 over 4h. Lin and co-workers [87] obtained the same conclusion in methanol media under milder reaction conditions than that Manzer applied. Ru/C catalyst also showed outstanding catalytic performance for gas hydrogenation of LA as compared with Pt, Pd and Ni-based catalysts [91,112,113]. The excellent performance of Ru-based catalysts is partially attributed to the nature of the supports. Al-Shaal et al. [114] also found that the catalytic activity of Ru/C was much higher than Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/SiO2, for the selective reduction of LA and its esters to GVL. The GVL yield of 97.5% was achieved over Ru/C at room temperature under H2 pressure of 12bar for 50h, in contrast, GVL yields of only 1.7% and 6.3% were recorded over Ru/SiO2 and Ru/Al2O3 respectively. The dispersion of Ru nanoparticles (Ru-NPs) supported on activated carbon, a key parameter to control catalytic activity of the supported catalysts, was much better than that of supported on other supports. For instance, the dispersion of Ru-NPs supported on TiO2 could be improved by lowering the loadings of active metal from 5% to 0.6%, resulting in a higher GVL yield of 93% over 0.6% Ru/TiO2 than that over 5% Ru/C (90%) at the same reaction conditions [115]. Besides the dispersion of active metal, water was also proven to be responsible for the outstanding activity of Ru-based catalysts in aqueous phase because the calculated energetic barrier of the reaction pathway was decreased in the presence of H2O [116]. Recently, García et al. have reported the reduction of LA to GVL over in-situ generated Ru-NPs with size of 2–3nm, resulting in a high GVL yield of 99% at 130°C for 24h under 25bar H2 in water [117]. But, the catalytic activity of these in-situ generated Ru-NPs was decreased significantly after only three consecutive run. In addition, Pd-NPs were also prepared and employed as the catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of LA [118,119]. Compared with Ru-NPs, relatively tougher reaction conditions (180°C, 6h and 90bar H2) were the prerequisite to ensure a high GVL yield using Pd-NPs. Some efforts have recently been paid to produce GVL under very mild conditions in order to improve the economy of heterogeneous hydrogenation systems. The presence of acid co-catalysts was confirmed to be largely promoted the hydrogenation of LA to GVL under very mild reaction conditions using Ru/C catalyst. For example, GVL yield of 99.9% was readily obtained using Ru/C and Amberlyst 70 as co-catalyst at 70°C, 0.5MPa H2 for 3h in water [120]. However, the LA conversion of only 13% was measured in the absence of acid co-catalyst under the same reaction conditions. Besides Ru-based catalysts, iridium nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (Ir/CNT) was also showed an unexpected activity under mild reaction conditions. A high GVL yield of 99% was achieved over Ir/CNT at 50°C, 2Mpa H2 for only 1h in water, and a GVL yield of 97% was also obtained even under solvent-free conditions over 20h [121]. It is noted that LA could be completely converted even in presence of formic acid (FA, co-producted with LA in an equimolar amount during the acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass) using Ir/CNT catalyst in aqueous phase. Therefore, biomass-derived LA/FA stream may be used directly as the feed for the production of GVL. But, Ir is also one of noble metals and much more expensive than Ru. Acidic co-catalysts and supports, including trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), hydroxyapatite, polyethersulfone, H-ZSM5 and H-β, have been proven to catalyze the lactonization of intermediates HPA to GVL under mild reaction conditions, thus facilitating the holistic conversion of LA into GVL [122–128]. For example, LA could be completely converted to GVL catalyzed by 316 stainless steel with the assistance of HOTf at 75°C [126]. However, acidic supports would further catalyzed the ring-opening of the resulting GVL to form over-reductive compounds, including PA, pentenoic acid, 1,4-pentanediol and MTHF, at higher reaction temperatures (>200°C) [129]. Multiphase systems have also been developed to promote the separation of desired products and catalysts from the reaction solvent. Bourne et al. [49] have developed an attracting biphase catalytic system consisting of supercritical CO2 (scCO2, the upper) and water (the lower) for the synthesis of GVL. LA was hydrogenated to GVL with a yield of 99% catalyzed by Ru/SiO2 in water, and the resulting GVL would transfer spontaneously to scCO2 phase from aqueous phase. Almost pure GVL was obtained after separation and pressure-relieving of supercritical CO2. It is noted that high pressure (10MPa) was the prerequisite for the formation of scCO2/H2O biphase system. A liquid triphase system (aqueous phase/ionic liquid/organic phase) was also demonstrated for the recovery of catalysts after reaction [130]. In this triphase catalytic system, Ru/C or a homogeneous Ru precursor was dispersed in ionic liquid phase before and after reaction, and could be easily separated from reaction mixture for the next test. A high selectivity of 100% toward the desired product was achieved at 100°C under 35bar H2 for 4h, however, the cost of ionic liquid limited its applications in a commercial scale. Furthermore, Dumesic et al. have reported a water/2-sec-butyl-phenol (SBP) biphasic system for selective hydrogenation of LA using RuSn bimetallic catalysts [131]. The high partition coefficient of GVL between SBP and water was ensured the extraction of GVL from water to SBP phase. SBP was regarded as a renewable solvent which could be produce from lignin [132]. However, the doping of Sn avoided the formation of hydrogenated products from solvent as compared with monometallic Ru/C catalyst under the applied reaction conditions. The conversion of biomass-derived LA directly into GVL is highly desirable due to the elimination of costly separation of LA, largely facilitating the economy of GVL production from biomass. Heeres et al. [133] have recently reported a one-pot process for GVL production from fructose using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and Ru/C as the catalysts for dehydration and subsequent hydrogenation, respectively. A maximum GVL yield of 62% based on fructose was obtained under the optimal conditions (180°C, 94bar H2, 8h). Similarly, one-pot conversion of cellulose to GVL was also reported using niobium-based solid acids and Ru/C as the catalysts for the LA production and the subsequent hydrogenation, respectively [134]. Recently, a two-steps approach was successfully developed for the conversion of giant reed to GVL under mild conditions [135]. Giant reed was firstly treated in 0.4M HCl solution at 180°C for 1h to produce LA with a yield of 59.1% (based on cellulose fraction). After neutralization and filtration, the biomass-derived LA was directly hydrogenated to GVL over Ru/C with niobium oxide or niobium phosphate as co-catalysts. This approach gave a GVL yield of 16.6wt% (calculated on giant reed starting weight) at 70°C under 3MPa H2 for 5h. Additionally, FAL derived from hemicellulose is an alternative to be used as feedstock for the production of GVL (Fig. 1). Hengne et al. [136] have demonstrated a two steps-“one pot” approach by which FAL was firstly converted to methyl levulinate (ML) using sulfonic acid functionzed ionic liquids and the resulting ML was subsequently reduced to GVL over Ru/C. Sulfonic acid functionzed ionic liquid ([BMIm-SH][HSO4]) was found having little impact on the Ru/C catalyst, and the maximum GVL yield of 68% starting from FAL was achieved in methanol."
5,Using formic acid (FA) as hydrogen resource,"4.2 Using formic acid (FA) as hydrogen resource Formic acid has recently been regarded as a promising hydrogen source and hydrogen storage material [137,138]. Depending on the reaction mechanism previously reported, FA formed in an equimolar amount with LA through acidic hydrolysis of carbohydrates [20,139,140]. Employing FA as in situ hydrogen source for the selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived LA embodies the principle of atom economy ( Table 4). Recently, Horváth et al. have demonstrated a homogeneous catalytic system to convert LA to GVL by hydride transfer from HCOONa using [(η6-C6Me6)Ru(bpy)(H2O)][SO4] in an acid aqueous solution (pH=4) [95]. This catalytic systems gave a GVL yield of only 25% at 70°C for 18h under N2, and over-reduced product 1,4-pentandiol (25%) was also detected by GC–MS analysis. Inexpensive sulfate was also used as a temperature-switchable base for the transfer hydrogenation of LA from FA under hydrothermal conditions, but a maximum GVL yield of only 11.0% was obtained in the presence of Na2SO4 for 12h [141]. FA can also be decomposed into molecular H2 and CO2 for the hydrogenation of LA over metal catalysts. Heeres et al. have described a one-pot catalytic route that fructose was converted to GVL by cascade reactions in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and Ru/C using external FA as hydrogen source [133]. It is noted that both of the decomposition of FA and the hydrogenation of LA were catalyzed by Ru/C. The highest GVL yield of 52% was obtained starting from fructose at 180°C, 16h and 50bar N2. In situ generated Ru-NPs were also showed an attracting catalytic activity for the transformation of synthetic LA/FA stream into GVL. This in situ catalyst gave a completely quantitative conversion of LA at 130°C for 24h with the assistance of Et3N [117]. Nevertheless, a poor stability of these Ru-NPs was observed after only three consecutive run. Recently, Ag–Ni–ZrO2 nanocomposite was prepared for the hydrogenation of LA using FA as hydrogen source. LA with equimolar amount of FA was quantitatively converted to GVL in aqueous at 220°C for 5h over Ag–Ni–ZrO2, in contrast, GVL yield of only 22% or 34% was achieved over Ag/ZrO2 or Ni/ZrO2 respectively [142]. The exceptionally performance of Ag–Ni–ZrO2 nanocomposite was attributed to the surface synergism between Ag and Ni. Shvo catalyst was also developed to hydrogenate LA to GVL using FA as a in situ hydrogen source under solvent-free conditions [42]. Shvo catalyst is an effective catalyst for the decomposition of FA into CO2 and H2 [149], however, the presence of CO2 largely hindered the subsequent hydrogenation of LA [148]. It is noted that Shvo catalyst is also very expensive and difficult to be recycled from the reaction system. It is practically significant to convert biomass-derived LA/FA, rather than synthetic LA/FA, to GVL. Fu et al. have recently developed an efficient homogeneous catalytic system that biomass-derived LA/FA was directly converted to GVL in the presence of RuCl3/PPh3 and bases co-catalysts [143]. The activity of Ru-based complex catalyst was closely associated with the intensity of bases co-catalysts (Basicity: KOH>NaOH>NEt3>pyridine>NH3>LiOH). The overall GVL yield of 48% based on glucose was achieved at 150°C for 12h in the presence of RuCl3/PPh3 and pyridine, and no extra H2 or FA was added into this reaction system. However, poor water resistance of this Ru-based complex catalyst was observed and the recovery of spent catalyst from this homogeneous catalytic system was also very difficult. In view of above-mentioned disadvantages of homogeneous catalytic system, a two-step process has been developed for the conversion of LA to GVL using FA as hydrogen source over immobilized Ru catalyst (Ru-P/SiO2) and Ru/TiO2 [144]. Catalysts could be readily recovered from the solvent after reaction, although, a considerable decrease in hydrogenation rate of LA was observed using this heterogeneous catalytic system as compared with previous homogeneous system. Most importantly, it is difficult to hydrogenate biomass-derived LA over Ru–P/SiO2 catalyst due to the presence of humins. Cao et al. have demonstrated a fascinating hydrogen-independent catalytic strategy for transferring biomass-derived LA/FA into GVL over Au/ZrO2 [145,146,150]. Au/ZrO2 catalyst showed unparalleled performance that FA could be completely decomposed into H2 and CO2 at 150°C for only 20min. Prolonging reaction duration to 6h, GVL yield of 99% was easily achieved from LA with equimolar amount of FA over Au/ZrO2 in aqueous. When aqueous solution containing biomass-derived LA and FA (partially neutralized to pH=2) was used as feed, the overall GVL yield of 51% or 33% was obtained over Au/ZrO2 starting from glucose or cellulose, respectively. These results indicate that Au/ZrO2 catalysts have outstanding water resistance and high catalytic activity even in the presence of intractable humins. Au is an expensive and rare metal on the earth, therefore, Cu/ZrO2 catalyst was also prepared for the hydrogenation of LA using FA as hydrogen source [147]. Compared with Au/ZrO2, relatively tough reaction conditions were essential to ensure a high GVL yield over Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. For example, synthetic LA/FA stream could be completely converted to GVL over Cu/ZrO2 at 200°C under 1MPa N2 for 5h. Cu/ZrO2 catalyst gave a highest GVL yield of 18.5wt% from giant reed-derived LA/FA stream (partially neutralized to pH=2) at 200°C under 1MPa N2 for 12h."
6,Using alcohols as H-donors,"4.3 Using alcohols as H-donors Aldehyde or ketones can be reduced to corresponding alcohols through Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction using other alcohols as the H-donors, and homologous aldehyde or ketones is formed after the dehydrogenation of primary or secondary alcohols, respectively [151]. Recently, many researches have been focused on the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of LA and it esters to GVL using alcohols as H-donors ( Fig. 7). Advances in the production of GVL via CTH are summarized in Table 5 depending on the diversity of H-donors and substrates. Chia and co-workers have firstly reported the conversion of LA and its esters to GVL through hydrogen transfer from alcohols over inexpensive metal oxide catalysts [152]. Of metal oxides used, ZrO2 was identified to be the most active catalyst [153] and GVL yields over 80% from alkyl levulinates could be obtained under the optimal reaction conditions. However, a GVL yield of only 22% from LA was observed over ZrO2 even after long reaction duration of 16h. The above observation was attributed to the negative impact caused by organic acid because the catalytic activity of catalyst strongly associated with basic sites on ZrO2 solid [154]. Alkyl levulinates could be readily produced by alcoholysis of carbohydrates with a high yield and be separated economically as compared with LA, because alkyl levulinates such as ML is acid-free and high volatility [22–24]. Therefore, alkyl levulinates, such as ML and EL, are better alternatives than LA for producing GVL from biomass through CTH process. ZrO(OH)2 also showed a unexpected catalytic performance for the CTH of levulinates, in contrast to other metal hydroxides including La(OH)3, Al(OH)3 and so on [155]. Notably, ZrO(OH)2 showed a much better catalytic stability than ZrO2 under the applied reaction conditions. The apparent activation energy for the CTH of EL over Sn(IV) or Zr(IV) zeolite-like catalyst model sites was computed by quantum chemical methods [156]. The calculated apparent activation energy for this transformation over a Sn(IV) zeolite-like catalyst model site (21.9kcal/mol) was parallel to that (20.7kcal/mol) catalyzed by Al(III)-isopropoxide (homogeneous catalyst), suggesting that Sn or Zr-based solid catalysts are more favorable for CTH of levulinates to GVL via MPV reduction. Moreover, MPV reduction is strongly associated with the nature of H-donors, and the reduction potential of reducing alcohols decreased in the order of: 2-propanol≈2-butanol<1-butanol<ethanol<methanol [151,157]. Steric effects of substrates and H-donors should also be taken into account. For instance, the selectivity to GVL from EL or BL in 1-butanol media was lower than that from EL in ethanol media, although 1-butanol has a lower reduction potential than ethanol [155]. Recently, Zr-Beta was prepared and showed high catalytic activity for converting LA to GVL via MPV reduction in 2-pentanol using solvent refluxing method [158]. Zr-Beta was also robust for the vapor phase GVL production (250°C) via MPV reduction and LA was completely converted under the prescribed conditions. The outstanding performance of Zr-Beta was attributed to the presence of Lewis acidic sites with moderate strength. Besides using LA and its esters as the feedstock, Bui et al. have reported a one-pot approach for the transformation of furfural into GVL through domino reaction catalyzed by zeolites with Brønsted and Lewis acid sites [159]. In this report, Al-MFI-ns (Brønsted acid) and Zr-Beta (Lewis acid) were prepared and catalyzed the alcoholysis of FAL to levulinates, and MPV reduction of furfural and levulinates to FAL and GVL, respectively. This approach gave a best GVL yield of 78% starting from furfural in the presence of Zr-Beta and Al-MFI-ns at 120°C for 48h using 2-butanol as solvent and H-donor. Raney Ni prepared by alkali corrosion of Ni–Al alloy showed a unequaled catalytic performance for the CTH of EL to GVL using 2-propanol as H-donor under room temperature. The best GVL yield of 99% was obtained over Raney Ni at 25°C for 9h in 2-propanol media [160]. Differing from the mechanism of MPV reduction, Fu et al. demonstrated that two H-atoms freed from 2-propanol to remain on the Ni surface and then attacked to the carbonyl group in EL. This hydrogenation mechanism is very similar to the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds under molecular H2 over Raney Ni. However, γ-hydroxypentanoates, intermediates for the conversion of levulinates to GVL, rather than GVL was verified to be the main product (above 90%) over a commercial Raney Ni catalyst at 25°C using 2-propanol as the H-donor [90]. GVL yield could be improved to 94% when reaction temperature was increased to 120°C. It is noted that the Raney Ni catalyst used by Fu et al. was prepared by alkali corrosion of Ni–Al alloy in an aqueous solution of NaOH [160]. Therefore, Geboers et al. proved that residual Al species on the Raney Ni catalyst prepared by alkali corrosion of Ni-Al alloy should be mainly responsible for the lactonization of intermediate γ-hydroxypentanoates to yield GVL at room temperature [90]. For instance, the rate of lactonization of methyl γ-hydroxypentanoate into GVL over γ-Al2O3 was much faster than that over Ni/C or Raney Ni. In addition to the above-mentioned hydrogen sources, LA in aqueous was also completely converted to GVL using syngas (H2/CO=2:1) as hydrogen source over Au/ZrO2 at 120°C for 4h [161]. At this point, CO and H2O were converted into H2 and CO2 catalyzed by Au/ZrO2. Xin et al. have developed an electrocatalytic process for converting LA to valeric acid (VA) or GVL [162,163]. This process could gave a selectivity of 95 % to VA in acidic electrolyte (pH=0) and 100% selectivity to GVL in neutral electrolyte (pH=7.5). Apparently, this is a very clean and effective process for GVL production from LA. Additionally, several biological processes were also employed for the production of GVL [164,165]."
7,Summary and outlook,"In this review, we highlight the applications of GVL as a unique solvent for producing chemicals and sugars from biomass and as a promising precursor for new generation biofuels. And, advances in the production of GVL by selective hydrogenation of LA and its esters are also summarized systematically on the basis of the diversity of hydrogen sources. The future role of GVL will strongly depend on its manufacturing costs from biomass. At some point, a cost-effective process for producing LA from lignocellulosic biomass is the real bottleneck for the GVL production in a large scale. LA could be produced from various biomass materials with high yields [14], however, it is still a challenge to economically separate LA because of its strong acidity and low volatility. Transferring biomass-derived LA/FA into GVL embodies the principal of atom economy and eliminates energy-intensive separation of LA. For example, biomass-derived LA was directly converted to GVL over Au/ZrO2 or Cu/ZrO2 catalysts using FA as the in situ hydrogen source [145]. Residual mineral acid catalysts and humins derived from acid-catalyzed degradation of biomass were confirmed to be having a negative impact on the activity of catalysts. Therefore, more studies should be devoted to develop robust and effective catalysts for the conversion of biomass-derived LA against mineral acid catalysts and humins. On the other hand, the CTH of levulinates via MPV reduction is a better alternative for the production of GVL. For instance, EL could be produced from biomass via ethanolysis [22,24] and be readily separated as its high volatility as compared with LA. Several high-efficiency catalytic strategies for the CTH of pure EL to GVL have been recently developed [155,160]. Compared with conventional hydrogenation route, the management of liquid alcohols used in the CTH route is more convenient than molecular H2. The CTH of levulinates to GVL can be carried out over cheaper base metal catalysts (containing of Zr, Ni and Sn), facilitating economic feasibility of this approach in a commercial scale. Furthermore, the CTH route via MPV reduction shows an exclusive selectivity to the carbonyl group in EL, avoiding over-hydrogenated products derived from GVL. In particular, the holistic conversion of levulinates to GVL would be largely promoted under very mild conditions by integrating catalysts for CTH of levulinates to intermediates and subsequent lactonization of intermediates to GVL, respectively [90,160]. It is highly desirable to transfer biomass-derived levulinates (without separation) into GVL using alcohols as in-situ hydrogen source. However, it is a great challenge now that the CTH of biomass-derived levulinates to GVL in the presence of humins, because chewy humins would adsorb onto the surface of catalyst solids and resulted in the deactivation of catalysts. Ongoing researches should be also partially focused on exploring humins-resistant catalysts for GVL production from levulinates derived from alcoholysis of biomass without imputing additional hydrogen source."
