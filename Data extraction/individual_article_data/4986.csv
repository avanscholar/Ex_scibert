0,Introduction,"Long-term and excess alcohol intake is one of the most important risk factors of atraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in East Asian countries [1–6]. The natural history of alcohol-associated ONFH indicates that the diseased hip can deteriorate to collapsed femoral head and advance to premature arthritis, given a delayed diagnosis as well as a noneffective intervention [7–9]. Clinical features include moderate-to-severe pain and significant dysfunction. For pre-collapsed stages of ONFH, core decompression and free vascularized fibular grafting might postpone the disease progression. However, hip arthroplasty is the mainstream treatment of choice for collapsed femoral head due to osteonecrosis [10,11]. Alcohol consumption in East Asia is still increasing, therefore, effective methods to prevent alcohol-associated ONFH are pivotal. In traditional Chinese medicine, herb and natural products have been used to cure bone diseases for a long time [12–29]. Among of them, muscone (3-methylcyclopentadecanone) (Fig. 1 ), which is the main ingredient of musk, can improve microcirculation, relieve pain and promote caring of sprains and fractures [15–17,20]. Recent studies also revealed that muscone could suppress inflammation and play beneficial effects on multiple systems [14]. Therefore, we asked whether muscone could (1) ameliorate osteogenesis of precursor cells in vitro, and (2) prevent alcohol-induced ONFH in vivo."
1,Materials and methods,The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital. All experiments on human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and animals were performed according to approved guidelines and regulations.
2,The isolation and culture of hBMSCs,"2.1 The isolation and culture of hBMSCs hBMSCs were harvested from young patients having total hip arthroplasty due to traumatic femoral neck fractures, as we described in a previous study [30]. The hBMSCs were maintained with α-MEM (Gibco, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco). The hBMSCs were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. The passage of hBMSCs was carried out when they were grown to 70–80% confluence. The hBMSCs of 6–9 passages were used in all following performances."
3,Cell proliferation,"2.2 Cell proliferation The effect of ethanol (Sigma) and muscone (Sigma) on the proliferation of hBMSCs was assessed using a commercially available kit, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Japan). In brief, an initial density of 5×103 cells/well were prepared in 96-well plates and cultured in the conditions of 50mM ethanol and/or a given concentration of muscone of 10μM for 1, 3, 5 and 7days. The concentrations of ethanol and muscone were determined based on our pilot experiment as well as a critical review of previous studies [15,20]. Subsequently, a volume of 20μl CCK-8 solution and 180μl culture medium was added to each well at respective time point and incubated for 2h at 37°C. A volume of 100μl aliquots was taken from each well and transferred to another 96-well plate for final analysis. The absorbance of samples was measured at 450nm with a spectrophotometric microplate reader (Bio-Rad 680, Hercules, CA). The results were expressed as the optical density of the aliquots minus the absorbance of the blank well."
4,Alizarin red staining,"2.3 Alizarin red staining After osteogenic induction for 14days, hBMSCs grown in 48-well plates were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45min at 4°C atmosphere. Cells were rinsed twice with distilled water and stained with 40mM alizarin red S (ARS; Servicebio, Wuhan, China) for 5min. These cells were rinsed again with PBS before visualization by microscopy. Positive staining was represented as a red/purple color."
5,ALP activity,"2.4 ALP activity To detect ALP activity, 1×105 cells/well were seeded in a 48-well plate. When cells were grown to 90% confluence, the culture medium was replaced with osteogenic induction medium (Cyagen Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA), to induce osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. To investigate the dose effect of muscone, we carried out ALP assays with different concentrations of muscone, as was suggested by previous studies [14]. The culture medium was refreshed every day. The ALP activity was measured using a microplate test kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China)."
6,RT-PCR,"2.5 RT-PCR The gene expression of collagen 1 (COL-1) and osteocalcin (OCN) was quantified using qRT-PCR on day 3. RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Prepared RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using EasyScript one-step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis Supermix (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed on the ABI HT7900 (Applied Biosystems, Australia) using the TransStart Tip Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative expression of the genes was normalized to β-actin. The forward and reverse primers (BioTNT, Shanghai, China) are provided as following: COL-1: forward: 5′ GAC ATC CCA CCA ATC ACC TG and reverse: 5′ CGT CAT CGC ACA ACA CCT T. OCN: forward: 5′ AGC CTT TGT GTC CAA GCA 3′ and reverse: 5′ CCA GCC ATT GAT ACA GGT AG 3′. β-actin: forward: 5′ AAG GTG ACA GCA GTC GGT T-3′ and reverse: 5′-TGT GTG GAC TTG GGA GAG G-3′."
7,Animal grouping and treatment,"2.6 Animal grouping and treatment Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish animal model of alcohol-induced ONFH as we described previously [31,32]. Briefly, 30 rats were randomly and equally divided into three groups, namely, normal control group (NC), alcohol group (AL) and alcohol+Muscone group (AL+Muscone). The rats in AL group received an ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet (FBSH, Shanghai, China), containing 8% (weight/volume) ethanol (36% of daily calories), fat (38% of daily calories) and protein (17% of daily calories). The total feeding period was 6 weeks. Rats in AL+Muscone group received the same ethanol-containing diet for 6 weeks while co-treated with muscone (1mg/kg/d) by intraperitoneal injection. Control rats were fed with the Lieber-DeCarli diet without ethanol (the ethanol was substituted with maltodextrin which derives the same amount of calories) for 6 weeks. All rats were allowed to adapt to Lieber-DeCarli diet one week prior to the initiation of experiment. Diets were prepared freshly just before daily feeding."
8,Micro-CT scanning,"2.7 Micro-CT scanning Five femoral heads in left side of each group were performed the micro-CT scanning. Micro-CT scanning was performed on the scalps to visualize osteonecrosis in femoral head. The resolution was set at routine 9μm and image acquisition was set at 35kV of energy and 220mA of intensity. CTVox software (Skyscan) and CTAn program (Skyscan) were used for the reconstruction and quantification of three-dimensional images. The ratio of bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm3) was calculated by CTAn program."
9,Hematoxylin & eosin staining,"2.8 Hematoxylin & eosin staining Decalcification of specimens was carried out with EDTA solution for one month. After decalcification, bone tissue of the femoral head was embedded in paraffin and cut into 4-μm-thick sections. For the evaluation of subchondral trabecular structure, five specimens of each group were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), subsequently examined by LEICA DM 4000 microscope to observe and capture the grand morphology."
10,Masson and immunohistochemical staining,"2.9 Masson and immunohistochemical staining The paraffin-embedded specimens were sectioned into 4μm thickness, which were then stained by Masson's trichrome (Abcam, Shanghai, China) as manufacturer’s description. For immunohistochemical staining, the representative sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5min, deparaffinized, antigen retrieved, stained with primary anti-COL1 and anti-osteocalcin (OCN) (Abcam) for 30min. Subsequently, all sections were incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. The sections were stained with DAB (diaminobenzidine), counter-stained with hematoxylin, and then mounted with Permount™ solution (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). All images were observed and captured by LEICA DM 4000 microscope."
11,Statistical analysis,"2.10 Statistical analysis All numerical values were shown as means±SE (standard error). SPSS 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) were used to analyze the data. Comparisons among multiple groups were performed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistical differences."
12,Results,
13,Muscone benefited alcohol-suppressing osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro,"3.1 Muscone benefited alcohol-suppressing osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro On day 21, we could find osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs was significantly suppressed by alcohol revealed by alizarin red staining. However, the osteogenesis potential of hBMSCs could be retrieved by the supplement of muscone (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, ALP positive staining was decreased by ethanol, and restored by muscone as well (Fig. 2B). On day 14, we measured ALP activity using a commercial kit. Different concentrations of muscone were used to investigate the dose effect on hBMSCs differentiation. As a result, ethanol significantly decreased the ALP activity, which could be restored by the co-treatment of muscone. Specifically, 1μM of muscone slightly increased the ALP activity whereas 10μM of muscone was the best efficient to rescue the osteogenic effect of hBMSCs. (*P< 0.05, n=3) (Fig. 2C). mRNA levels of COL1 and OCN were selected as markers to reflect induced osteogenesis. It was found that ethanol significantly decreased COL1 and OCN mRNA expression, while muscone could increase COL1 and OCN mRNA to a comparative level of the control group (*P< 0.05, n=3) (Fig. 2D and E). Similarly, the protein levels of COL1 and Runx2 were detected. The results indicated that Runx2 and COL1 protein expression was significantly decreased by ethanol treatment and increased by muscone in BMSCs (Fig. 2F). The proliferation of hBMSCs was not changed by muscone revealed by CCK-8 method (*P< 0.05, n=3) (Fig. 2G)."
14,Muscone alleviated alcohol-induced ONFH in rats in vivo,"3.2 Muscone alleviated alcohol-induced ONFH in rats in vivo To investigate the roles of muscone on ethanol-induced ONFH, the rat model of ONFH was established by feeding Lieber-Decarli ethanol-containing liquid diet. We have successfully used the model to explore the mechanism of alcohol-induced ONFH in our previous studies. Intraperitoneal injection of muscone or an equal volume of saline was set as treatment or control group. Six weeks after respective treatment, micro-CT scanning was used to observe and quantify bone tissues of the femoral head. Eight out of 10 rats in AL group showed visible signs of ONFH, while only 2 out of 10 rats in AL+ Muscone group was found with mild ONFH (Fig. 3 A). No rat was found with ONFH in NC group. Quantitative analyses of micro-CT data further confirmed the negative role of alcohol, and the beneficial efficacy of muscone on preventing alcohol-induced ONFH in rats. As shown in Fig. 3B, BV/TV ratio (27.69±7.07) of the femoral head in AL group were significantly lower compared to that in NC group (66.80±3.60; P< 0.05). Supplementation of muscone remarkably increased BV/TV ratio (49.52±8.96, P< 0.05 when versus AL group). Bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm3) of the femoral head in AL group (0.22±0.02) was significantly decreased than that in NC group (0.35±0.04; P< 0.05). The decreased BMD induced by alcohol could be restored partially by muscone treatment (Fig. 3C). It is well known that alcohol intake can result in osteoporosis, while it is revealed for the first time that alcohol-induced osteoporosis can be rescued by muscone. Next, routine histopathological examination, H&E staining, was carried out to verify our micro-CT findings. We identified typical osteonecrotic lesions of the femoral head in 8/10 rats in AL group, defined as disappeared structural trabeculae in subchondral bone. After six weeks of corresponding treatment, the subchondral bone of femoral head in AL group (8/10 rats) was found occupied by non-structural chondrocytes in H&E images (Fig. 4 A and B). However, significantly fewer pathological changes were observed in AL+ Muscone group, while no apparent pathological changes were found in the NC group throughout the experiment. These data supported our micro-CT results of the protective effect of muscone on alcohol-induced ONFH. The body weight of rats in each group maintained gradual growth and no differences (Fig. 4C)."
15,Muscone rescued alcohol-associated decreased osteogenesis in vivo,"3.3 Muscone rescued alcohol-associated decreased osteogenesis in vivo We used Masson’s trichrome staining to reflect the condition of collagen synthesis in NC, AL and AL+Muscone group, respectively. It was found that collagen synthesis was dramatically decreased in the femoral head of rats from AL group (Fig. 5 A). The trabeculae beneath the cartilage of the femoral head were disappeared in AL group, however, the trabecula in AL+Muscone was partially preserved. The subchondral area in AL group was occupied by chondrocyte-like cells. Subchondral osteocyte-to-chondrocyte transition (OCT) is a common pathologic in rat’s model of ONFH. Although we have noticed the phenomenon for a long period, it is the first time to propose the concept of OCT. We performed histochemical staining of osteogenic-related markers, COL1 and OCN, of specimens from rats’ femoral heads. The images showed less COL1 and OCN positive staining on subchondral trabeculae in AL group compared with NC group. However, co-administration of muscone markedly increased the positive staining compared with that in the AL group (Fig. 5B and C). Quantifications of positive staining areas were carried out by ImageJ software. (Fig. 5D and E, *P< 0.05). The results were in consistent with in vitro investigations, namely, muscone had a protective role on ethanol-treated BMSCs."
16,Discussion,"Alcohol intake is one of the leading risk factors of atraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head in China, Japan and Korea. A multicentric study including 6395 patients with ONFH in China showed that alcohol consumption is the leading risk factor for atraumatic ONFH, accounting for 30.7% of total patients [1]. In Japan, the fifth round of national epidemiologic investigation revealed alcohol-induced ONFH took up 31% cases, just secondary to steroid-induced ONFH [3]. Kang and colleagues retrospectively reviewed patients with ONFH diagnosed from 2002 to 2006. They found the annual incidence of ONFH increased from 20.53/100,000 in 2002 to 37.96/100,000 in 2006. 32.4% patients had a history of alcohol abuse [6]. Alcohol can disrupt bone homeostasis and interrupt the dynamic bone formation, as a result, osteoporosis and osteonecrosis are two main presentations of skeleton in habitual and heavy drinkers. Due to satisfactory methods to cure alcohol-induced ONFH has not been established, effective therapeutic intervention to prevent ONFH seems to be of crucial importance. In our previous studies, we found that vitamin K2 could decrease the incidence of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH via modulation of the expression of osteocalcin and miRNA-133a [33–35]. We also found that alendronate could decrease the incidence of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH in the rat [36]. However, to our knowledge, few studies investigated the protective effects of any drugs on alcohol-induced ONFH with herb medicine. Musk is a valued traditional medicine and has been used in bone fracture and soft-tissue injury for a long time. As the main ingredient of musk, monomer of muscone could exert beneficial effects in multiple systems through in vitro and in vivo investigations. Liang et al. found that muscone could suppress inflammatory effects and had a potential treatment for intervertebral disc degeneration [14]. Musk could inhibit the expression of IL-1β and tumor necrosis α (TNFα), both of which are of critical importance in the development of ONFH. Okazaki and colleagues found that ONFH could be induced by disruption of the systemic immune response through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, and TLR-associated cytokines including IL-1β and TNFα were significantly increased in the animal model of ONFH established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone injection [37]. Similarly, TNFα level was also revealed to play a pivotal role in the development of ONFH with repeated LPS administration [38]. It is well known that LPS is a fundamental factor to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines production in human [39]. Therefore, drugs that can suppress inflammation process might be promising to cease the progress of ONFH and cure the disease. As the most famous double-edged sword, glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed to conquer a plethora of inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, nephrotic syndrome and rheumatic arthritis. However, glucocorticoids are also monsters to bring severe bone disruption. As an alternative therapy, extractives from herb medicine have been proved to be affirmative to decrease inflammation. Fu and colleagues found that tenuigenin, a major active component from Chinese herb Polygala tenuifolia, could protect against LPS-induced acute kidney injury via TLR4/NF-κB pathway [40]. The anti-inflammatory effect of musk should be the leading property to save femoral head. Meanwhile, in cytotherapy, administration of BMSCs with muscone in rats could improve their therapeutic efficacy [26]. Muscone also has vasodilator and angiogenic effects [15], which are pivotal in the repair of ischemic femoral head. Pharmacological studies showed that muscone could induce liver microsomal cytochrome P450 [23,25], as well as CYP1A2 and CYP3A11 enzyme expression in human [19]. Increased levels of these enzymes are beneficial in alcohol metabolism, also contributing to decreased incidence of ONFH. In the current study, we found that muscone could promote osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro. The suppressive effect of alcohol on osteogenesis can be reversed by muscone supplementation. In the in vivo study, muscone decreases the incidence of alcohol-induced ONFH in the rat model through histologic and radiologic investigations. Therefore, we believe that muscone might become an effective treatment of choice for the prevention of alcohol-induced ONFH. The current study is a pilot report concerning the beneficial role of muscone on alcohol-induced ONFH. Although our study included in vitro and in vivo experiments, the underlying mechanism that muscone promoting osteogenesis of BMSC has to be further revealed. Especially, the property of herb medicine to suppress inflammation is an attractive research area. Moreover, the effect of muscone on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption has to be investigated as well."
17,Conclusions,"In conclusion, our study demonstrated the protective effect of muscone against alcohol-induced ONFH both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, muscone may act as a valuable therapeutic natural drug for alcohol-induced ONFH in humans."
