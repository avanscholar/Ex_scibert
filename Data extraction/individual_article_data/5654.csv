0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehyde is one of the important reactions in organic synthesis because the corresponding aldehyde compound could be used in agriculture, pharmacy, and various chemical industries. Moreover, the selective oxidation reaction contributes to 30% of the total production of chemical products in the chemical industry [1–5]. Hence, the many key intermediates and chemicals such as ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, epoxides, and organic acids are produced via selective oxidation [6,7]. Nowadays, many chemical industry processes carried out by oxidation process viz., selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile, selective oxidation of the propene to acrolein, selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and epoxidation of ethylene topropylene [8–11]. Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been investigated by both vapor and liquid phase [12]. The oxidations in the liquid-phase generally carried out at below 100 °C, while in vaporphase, the molecular oxygen generally required the temperatures above 200 °C resulting in the formation of CO2 [13,14]. Moreover, large variety of oxidants such as, dioxiranes, H2O2, TBHP, benzoyl peroxide, peroxy acids etc. can be utilized and make liquid phase reactions more attractive [15]. The heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have performed in the liquid phase selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol [16]. Besides, the heterogeneous catalysts have major advantages such as high thermal stability, multiple active sites, an ease of recovery (solid), and reusability than the homogeneous catalysts. The heterogeneous catalysts also alternatives to the conventional stoichiometric inorganic oxidants, which are generating large amounts of hazardous waste and expensive [17–22]. Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) used in the synthesis of peroxide derivatives, another catalytic oxidation reaction, epoxidation reactions, and also polymerization reactions in the free radical initiator. Moreover, the active oxygen in TBHP is a good oxygen supplier, safe to handle and reasonably thermally stable under reaction conditions [23,24]. In recent times, SBA-15mesoporous silica has been recognized as a potential support for noble metals due to their ordered structure with pore diameters (in the range from 5 to 30 nm), higher surface area (more than 1000 m2/g), high thermal stability, improved dispersion of metal particles, and metal-support interactions [25–27]. It is known that sulfated zirconia having both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites and are responsible for the high catalytic activity [28]. In many reactions, sulfated zirconia supported on SBA-15 showed high activity such as glycerol esterification with palmitic acid [29], cumene cracking [30], cellobiose hydrolysis [31], oxybromination [32], etherification of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) with ethanol [33]. The selective oxidation of aldehyde and alcohols are the important components of chemical industry fractions have been extensively investigated over zirconium sulphate SO4–ZrO2 and other catalysts [34]. Many reports available for oxidation of the benzaldehyde reaction over ZrO2 supported on MCM-41 and ZSM-5. On the other hand, CeO2 (Ce/Si = 0.38–2.32) loading MCM-41 exhibiting an excellent activity in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol [35–37]. As per the literature studies, the Pt/SO4/ZrO2 and Pt/SO4/ZrO2-SBA-15 supported catalyst has not been reported for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in high-pressure fixed bed stainless steel reactor with TBHP. Hence this work presents the urea-assisted synthesis of SO4/ZrO2-SBA-15 and Pt/SO4/ZrO2-SBA-15 catalyst have been reported for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The preparation of the catalyst and the evaluation utilized with TBHP as the oxidant in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, the effects of temperature, pressure, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) have been investigated in detailed."
1,Experimental details,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts SBA-15 was synthesized in a Teflon-lined autoclave under autogenous pressure in an acidic medium (2 M HCl) following previously published article using Pluronic (P123) triblock copolymer (Mol. Wt. 5800) as the template and TEOS as the silica source [38]. The synthesized SBA-15 was dried at 373 K and calcined at 823 K after that, ZrO2 (10–30 wt.%) was deposited over calcined SBA-15 by a urea hydrolysis method. In a typical synthesis (for 10 wt.% ZrO2), 4.0 g of calcined SBA-15 was immersed in 120 mL of distilled water containing1.1622 g of Zirconium Oxychloride (ZrOCl.8H2O, Aldrich) and1.083 g of urea. The mixture was heated with stirring at 363 K for 5–6 h, and the resultant mixture was filtered and washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove chloride ions. Besides, the filtered ZrO2-SBA-15 was dried in air at 383 K for 24 h followed by calcination in air at 823 K for 6 h. Pure ZrO2 was prepared by adding a solution of the zirconium oxychloride salt drop wise to well-stirred 2 M ammonium hydroxide solution at room temperature. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 9–10 and refluxed at 100°C for 4 h. The precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water several times until the pH was close to neutral (pH 7). The obtained product was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h and stored in desiccators. Sulfation of ZrO2(SO4/ZrO2) and ZrO2-SBA samples was done by adding 4 g of the sample to60mL of 2 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature and stirred for 1 h. The sulphated sample was filtered, dried at 120 °C and calcined in the static at 700 °C for 3 h. The S-content of the samples were similarly being 0.77 ± 0.05 wt.%. The unsupported and supported SO4-ZrO2 samples code-name were SZ and SZ (x)/SBA-15 respectively, the x within brackets referring to the ZrO2 content in wt.%. All the samples were then impregnated with chloroplatinic acid by incipient wetness method. The amount and concentration of Pt-solution were adjusted to obtain 0.5wt.% of Pt in the final catalyst. The resulting mixture was dried in an air oven at 100 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in static air. To obtain the reduced form of Pt catalysts were treated in a hydrogen flow at 200 °C for 1 h. The reduction was done in situ in the reactor prior to the start of the reaction."
3,Characterization of support and catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of support and catalysts The specific surface area was measured by BET specific surface area N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms method (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The samples were degassed at 350 °C for 3 h prior to adsorption of N2. Further, the pore volumes and average pore size of the prepared sample were calculated by the BJH method. The crystalline structures of the calcined materials were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded using Cu Ka radiation (RigakuMiniflex II). FT-IR spectra of the samples were recorded at room temperature by the KBr disc method (Perkin-Elmer, Spectrum One) and TEM studies of the samples were obtained using a JEOL (JEM 2010) instrument. Moreover, the product compositions were monitored and analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Mayura, India) with a FID detector and 60 m capillary column. Besides, an octane number of the feed (LN) and products were calculated from GC composition and blending octane numbers for the individual compounds. At the experimental condition, the cracked products were not detected and the products were entirely in the gaseous state in the pure compounds. Some condensed liquid was also obtained when light naphtha was the feed in some runs. In these cases, both the liquid and gaseous products were analyzed separately and integrated."
4,Data treatment,"2.3 Data treatment The conversion and selectivity of benzyl alcohol were calculated from the initial and final amounts of benzyl alcohol obtained from GC results after every hour of reaction (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = X i n - X o u t Xin × 100 (2) S e l e c t i v i t y % = P r o d u c t C o n s u m e d r e a c t a n t × 100 The specific reaction rate (r, mol g−1 s−1) was calculated using the equation (3) r = F 0 A w where, F 0 = molar flow rate of n-C5 & n-C6 (mol s−1) and w = catalyst weight (g). Turnover frequency was calculated employing the following equation (4) TOF ( s - 1 ) = I s p e c i f i c r e a c t i o n r a t e [ r , m o l - 1 g s - 1 ] Q u a n t i t y o f s i t e s [ m o l / g ] The quantity of sites (μmol/g) was derived from the amount of Zr present (ICP) and their actual sites exposed to reaction (dispersion %)."
5,Catalytic studies,"2.4 Catalytic studies The reactions were carried out in a high-pressure fixed bed stainless steel reactor (i.d = 8 mm) operated in the down-flow mode. The catalyst (1–2 mm in size) was loaded and dried in situ at 250 °C in CO2 free air for 6 h. The reactor was then cooled to reduce in CO2 free air at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range of 60–110 °C for 1 h. The CO2 free airflow, pressure and temperature were then adjusted to the desired values and the feed injected. The general conditions of the reactions were: pressure: 10 bar, catalyst loading: 3.2 g, WHSV (h−1: 1, and temperature: 60–100 °C. The CO2 free air/feed (mole ratio) was 2 in the case of benzyl alcohol (20 mmol benzyl alcohol (BzOH), 25 mmol aqueous tertbutyl hydro peroxide (TBHP) as the oxidant and 10 ml of acetonitrile as the solvent). The products were analyzed in a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector, using a SGE BPX70 capillary column (70% Cyanopropyl Polysilphenylene-siloxane, 30 m × 0.53 mm × 0.50 ml) and N2 as the carrier gas."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical and spectroscopic characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical and spectroscopic characterization 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction studies The low angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and different ratio of the Pt-SZ/SBA-15 samples are presented in Fig. 1 A. The SBA-15 sample exhibits the typical patterns expected for the sample, the intensity peaks are continuous decrease after loading of each of the catalyst components, viz. ZrO2, SO4, and Pt. This suggests that continuous loss in the orderliness of the mesoporous structure due to the sequential impregnation and calcination. A slight shift in the position of the lines towards larger angles is also noticed in Fig. 1. Earlier workers have suggested that the deposition of oxides inside the pores of SBA-15 could cause such a shift [39]. The shift in the peaks is noticed even on loading small amounts of SO4 and Pt4+ (Fig. 1A), it is likely that at least a part of the shift in our case is due to changes in the structure of the pores. The high angle XRD patterns of Pt-SZ and Pt-SZ/SBA-15 catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . The pattern for Pt-SZ reveals a highly crystalline ZrO2with both monoclinic and tetrahedral structures, with a predominance of the monoclinic form [40].The supported catalysts do not exhibit any pattern through a broad peak at about 2ϴ = 23° for the amorphous silica structures is noticed. The absence of lines due to ZrO2 in Pt-SZ (30)/SBA-15 reveals that the Zr is well dispersed even at the high loading of 30%. 3.1.2 N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (BET) The N2-adsorption desorption isotherms of SBA-15 and the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3 . The adsorption–desorption isotherm is typical of that expected for a material with uniform pores, though some distortion in the hysteresis loop is noticed after loading of ZrO2 and the other components. This is probably due to differences in the thickness of the deposited ZrO2 inside the pores. The BET surface area and pore volumes of the samples are presented in Table 1 . The surface area (SA) of the SZ catalyst is 166 m2/g, and that of SBA-15 is 672 m2/g. Similarly, the pore volume (PV) of SBA-15 is larger than that of SZ, being 0.90 cm3/g for SBA-15 and 0.151 cm3/g for SZ. Deposition of the components decreases both the SA and PV of SBA-15, the decrease being substantial even at 10 wt.% ZrO2 loading. The decrease in SA and PV is due to deposition of the oxide inside the pores and blocking of some of the pores at high loadings. The average pore diameter calculated from the SA and PV data reveals a substantial narrowing of the pores at high loadings of ZrO2. 3.1.3 FT-IR spectroscopy The FTIR (Fourier Transform infra-red) spectra of SZ and the supported catalysts in the framework region of 4000–450 cm−1 are presented in Fig. 4 . The SZ exhibits multiple peaks between 900 and 1200 cm−1 attributed by earlier workers to (ZrO)3SO species and at least two absorption peaks between 1375 and 1450 due to SO bending mode besides a strong absorption at about 1620 cm−1 attributed to OH associated with sulfate groups [41]. In the case of SBA-15, broad and strong absorptions are noticed due to external and internal SiO2-tetrahedral vibrations along with a lower intensity peak at about 1625 cm−1 attributable to –OH groups. The different characteristic absorptions observed at around 1625 cm−1 is present in the supported catalysts. This absorption is probably mainly from the support and to a smaller extent from SZ. The absence of absorption bands in the 1375–1450 range in the supported catalysts could suggest structural dissimilarities between bulk and supported SZ. The bending, symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching of Si-O-Si vibration bands which are usually present in SBA-15 observed in all samples at 470, 795 and 1080 cm−1 respectively. This indicates that the support maintained the framework of silica, even after the sulfated zirconia loading of 30%. In addition, a shoulder at about 1240 cm−1 for the band at 1080 cm−1 becomes broad after the zirconia addition. It indicates that the existences of sulfur ions coordinated to zirconia cation are responsible for changes in the intensities of the band. An intense and broad band which is seen in all samples at 3450 cm−1, possibly, be assigned to the stretching vibrations of OH and Si–OH bonds. The intensity of the IR band at 960 cm−1decreases after the introduction of zirconia, which could probably be because of the stretching mode of [SiO4] unit bonded to heteroatoms [42–47]. 3.1.4 Transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) studies The transmission electron microscope (TEM) pictures of (a) SBA-15, (b) SZ (20)/SBA-15, (c) Pt-SZ (20)/SBA-15 (reduced) and (d) Pt-SZ (reduced) samples are presented in Fig. 5 .The structure of SBA-15 is found to possess a very ordered arrangement of mesopores (Fig. 5a). When 20% of ZrO2 is deposited, the orderliness of the pores is decreased and deposited ZrO2 are seen (Fig. 5b). The picture of a reduced sample of Pt-SZ (20)/SBA-15 exhibit the dispersed Pt particles of size less than 10 nm, revealing a reasonably good dispersion of the metal in the catalyst (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5d is the micrograph of reduced Pt-SZ, as seen from the figure the SZ particles are found to be small (about 10–15 nm) comparable with the size of Pt particles. 3.1.5 Temperature programmed desorption (NH3TPD) The acidity of the Pt/SZ and Pt/SO4/ZrO2-SBA-15 (Zr: Molar ratio = 10, 20, and 30%) catalysts was investigated using the NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3TPD). Table 1 shows the acidity levels of the catalysts measured by the temperature programmed desorption method. The high amounts of acid sites were measured on the Pt/SO4/ZrO2(20)-SBA-15 and Pt/SO4/ZrO2(10)-SBA-15 catalysts, respectively, whereas SZ had only 1.61 (mmol/g) of catalyst; these results indicate that the synthesized catalysts generally had much higher densities of acid sites. The NH3 TPD profiles of Pt/SZ and Pt/SO4/ZrO2-SBA-15 (Zr: Molar ratio = 10,20, and 30%) are shown in Fig. 6 . The prepared catalysts except SZ showed broad distributions of acid strengths. Whereas the SZ catalyst displayed a single peak at 420 °C, and the supported catalysts (Pt/SO4/ZrO2-SBA-15 (Zr: Molar ratio = 10, 20 and 30%) displayed two peaks 420 °C and 530 °C. The additional NH3TPD peak at higher temperature suggests that the Pt/SO4/ZrO2(20%)-SBA-15 catalysts have higher acid strength than the other catalyst. Therefore, the higher acidity of Pt/SO4/ZrO2(20%)-SBA-15 catalysts is due to the dispersion of active sites on the support and the interaction between the sulphated zirconia and the SBA-15 support."
8,Selective oxidation activity of the catalysts,"3.2 Selective oxidation activity of the catalysts The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) was carried out over the bulk Pt/SO4/ZrO2 and different Pt/SZ-SBA-15 (Zr molar ratio = 10, 20, and 30%) samples with constant reaction conditions. The optimization of the process parameters for maximizing BzOH conversion and benzaldehyde (BzH) selectivity was done by investigating the influence of the variation in reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature (60–100 °C), reaction pressure. Besides, the WHSV was studying using the most active sample of Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 and the sample was also investigated for reusability. 3.2.1 Influence of the reaction temperature The effect of temperature of benzyl alcohol conversion of (a) Pt-SZ, (b) Pt-SZ (10)/SBA-15, (c) Pt-SZ (20)/SBA-15 and (d) Pt-SZ (30)/SBA-15 is mentioned in Fig. 7 A & B. The vapor phase aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out over SZ supported on SBA-15 catalysts (Zr = 10, 20, and 30) in the temperature range of 60–100 °C. The benzyl alcohol oxidation oxygen flow rate was maintained at 0.1 mol h−1 and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was mentioned at 1.0 h−1. In benzyl alcohol oxidation, benzaldehyde was the major product and the selectivity was increased for increasing the temperature. The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol conversions over the different catalysts at the temperatures between 60 and 100 °C are presented in Fig. 7A. The SZ is found to be the least active among the others catalysts. However, 20% of SZ supported catalysts are the most selective oxidation and selectivity of benzyl alcohol than that of the other catalysts at the temperature between 60 and 100°Cis presented in Fig. 7B. Moreover, at the lower temperature the selectivity of the catalyst is high and the higher temperature the selectivity is decreasing in conversions of benzyl alcohol reaction. It is clear that the catalytic activity of Pt-SZ (20)/SBA-15 is comparatively higher than unsupported and other catalysts. The higher (%) loading of the ZrO2 content can lead to accumulation whereas low loading of ZrO2 content is not sufficient for the adsorption of reactant molecule on the ZrO2 surface. Moreover, the optimum (%) loading of ZrO2 which result in enhanced surface acidity (2.48 mmol/g) and ordered porosity with well dispersed Pt particles on the ZrO2/SBA-15 surface (Fig. 5 (b & c). Thus, optimum (%) loading of ZrO2 (20%) tunes the pore size and pore volume effectively which can control the diffusion limitation of the reactant molecule on the surface of the catalyst compared to unsupported SZ and ZrO2 loaded catalysts (10–30%). Therefore, appears that 90 °C is the optimum reaction temperature for the maximum yield of oxidation of benzyl alcohol conversion. 3.2.2 Specific reaction rate (SRR) and turnover frequency (TOF) The calculated specific reaction rate (mole g−1 s−1) and turnover frequency (TOF) of selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol reaction is given in Table 2 . Among the bulk Pt/SZ and different Pt/SZ-SBA-15 (Zr- 10, 20 and 30) catalyst was tested for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol were observed higher catalytic activity for Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 catalysts which corresponds to higher specific reaction rate (SRR) and turnover frequency (TOF) of benzyl alcohol are 8.40 × 10−4 (mol g−1 s−1) & 6.80 × 10−4 (mol g−1 s−1) and 3.69 & 3.01 s−1 respectively, as compared with others Si/Al ratio catalyst. Its reasonable for which may be the reason for the high activity of the catalyst and highest conversion. Finally, Pt/SZ catalysts were found to be very low activity of the SRR value and TOF value are 7.29 & 6.09 × 10−4 (mol g−1 s−1) and 3.23 & 2.7 s−1 this might be due to the unavailability of activity sites over the catalyst. A direct trend in the catalytic activity of Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 catalysts was obtained with maximum conversion compared to the other catalysts. The order of as catalytic activity can be put as Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 > Pt/SZ (30%)-SBA-15 > Pt/SZ (10%)-SBA-15. Comparison of TOF results obtained from previous literature with the Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 catalysts are presented in Table 2. 3.2.3 Influence of the reaction pressure The selective oxidation conversions of benzyl alcohol over the different catalysts at a pressure between 0 and 20 bar is presented in Fig. 8 A. The reaction was monitored, the constant WHSV and temperature 90 °C as the change in the pressure was investigated in the 0 to 20 range. The SZ is found to be the least active among the other catalysts. In the case of the supported catalysts, the 20% of SZ catalyst is the most active one. With the increase in the pressure, the selectivity is decreased and the conversion is increasing at an optimum level. When the H2 pressure raised from 10 bar to 20 bar, the feed conversion increased. As expected, further increasing CO2free air pressure from 10 bar there is an appreciable conversion observed. However, further increasing CO2free air pressure to 15–20 bar, only a small change in conversion observed. The selectivity of benzyl alcohol oxidation over the different catalysts at the temperature between 60 and 100 °C are mentioned in Fig. 8B. The selectivity of SZ is found to be the least active among the other catalysts. In the case of the supported catalysts, the selectivity of 20% of SZ catalyst is the most active than that of the other ratio catalyst. Considering the conversion and selectivity of feed, 10 bar CO2free air pressure would be enough to carry out the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. 3.2.4 Influence of the reaction WHSV Fig. 9 A shows the effect of WHSV was tested the conversion in the over the bulk Pt/SO4/ZrO2 and different catalyst Pt/SZ-SBA-15 (Zr molar ratio = 10, 20, and 30%) for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol monitor the constant pressure 10 bar and temperature 90 °C as the change in the WHSV was investigated in the 0.5 to 2.0 h−1 range. With the increase in the space velocity, the conversion is decreased at an optimum level. The SZ is found to be the least active among the other catalysts. In the case of the supported catalysts, the 20% SZ catalyst has the most active conversion. Fig. 9B shows the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out over the different catalysts at WHSV between 0.5 and 2.0 h−1 range. With the increase in the space velocity, the selectivity is increasing at an optimum level. The WHSV can be strongly influenced by the contact area of feed and catalyst affect the conversion and selectivity. In order to evaluate the effect of WHSV, the catalyst loading amount was kept constant (∼3.2 g) and by varying the feed flow rate. It can be seen that the conversion of benzyl alcohol feed decreased gradually with an increase of WHSV. The benzyl alcohol showed higher conversion compared to the other two at WHSV at 0.5 h−1. Only a small difference in conversion is observed between WHSV at 0.5 h−1 and 2.0 h−1. Hence, the WHSV = 1.0 h−1 is advisable for effective for benzyl alcohol conversion reaction (Fig. 10 ). 3.2.5 Effect of time on stream The effect of time on stream on benzyl alcohol conversion and product selectivity of benzaldehyde is studied over the bulk Pt/SO4/ZrO2 and different catalyst Pt/SZ-SBA-15 (Zr molar ratio = 10, 20, and 30%) catalyst at 90 °C with O2flow rate of 1.0 mol h−1 (Fig. 7D). The percentage of conversion and selectivity of the product was considerably slowly change throughout the reaction for 10 h, which shows that the catalyst was not get deactivate by coke formation till that reaction period. Further, increasing the stability of the catalyst may be the formation of carbon during reaction, which may give structural strength to prevent the sintering nature of catalyst. The stability of the catalyst was repeated and tested by using are generated spent catalyst. The spent catalyst was regenerated before each cycle by activation at 100 °C after washing with ether. The activity and selectivity were found to remain the same. The reaction is carried out for five cycles after regeneration under similar conditions and it was found that the catalyst showed similar activity up to five cycles. Hence, the Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 catalyst has the most stability towards the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in a fixed bed reactor."
9,Conclusion,"The Pt-SO4-ZrO2 supported on the high surface area SBA-15 possesses a higher catalytic activity in the of selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde than the bulk material. This is attributed to the good dispersion of ZrO2 over the support. Even at 30% loading, ZrO2 could not be detected by X-ray diffraction in the catalyst. Among the supported catalysts, the 20% catalyst is more active in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the maximum conversion and selectivity being observed over this catalyst at 90 °C and 10 Bar. We conclude that the Pt/SZ (20%)-SBA-15 catalysts were long-term stability, excellent selectivity and higher conversion towards the benzyl alcohol conversion."
