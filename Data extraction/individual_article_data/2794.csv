0,Introduction,"It is widely accepted that hydrogen will play a critical role in future energy structure for its high energy content, clean combustion product and it is the only carbon-free fuel up to date. Among various hydrogen production ways, biological methods are more promising with great environmental benefits. Anaerobic fermentation can not only treat the organic waste, but also produce the energy or useful chemicals, which is widely used worldwide (Jiang et al., 2019, 2018a, 2018b, 2018c, Tang et al. 2019; Dennehy et al., 2018, 2017a, 2017b, 2016; Xie et al., 2017, 2016). Hydrogen production from biomass fermentation is closer to practical application for wide ranges of feedstock sources, easy operation and low cost. Algal biomass has been considered as the third-generation energy crop (Luque, 2010). Hydrolysis of algae can be much easier than land-based crops for the lack of lignin, which promotes its application in biological energy recovery. In particularly for macroalgae, it grows very fast, fixing CO2 without depending on cultivable land or fresh water. Macroalgae has been widely studied for the recovery of various value-added products, like alcohols, bio-lipids, syngas, hydrocarbons etc. (Wei et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2015). Quite a few studies have focused on biohydrogen production from macroalgae, strategies explored to enhance the hydrogen conversion efficiency mainly included: pretreatment, multi-stage fermentations, co-fermentation, novel microbes and detoxification (Sharma and Arya, 2017). The effects of metal ions on hydrogen production from macroalgae are rarely explored. Metals play important roles in dark fermentation processes, among which ferrous iron (Fe2+) is one of the most studied metal ions (Wang and Yin, 2017). Fe2+ acts as the active site of ferredoxins as well as hydrogenases, both of which play a crucial part in hydrogen-producing metabolism. Electrons formed from glycolysis are transported by ferredoxins to hydrogenase, then they are combined with hydrogen ions catalyzed by hydrogenases, forming molecule hydrogen (Zhao et al., 2017). Besides being important composition of key proteins, Fe2+ also showed stimulation effect on functional genes expression (Karadag and Puhakka, 2010), like the gene sequences of [FeFe]-hydrogenases and lactate dehydrogenase (Zhao et al., 2017). Furthermore, proper content of Fe2+ can promote the reactions follow hydrogen-producing metabolic pathways. Quite a few studies have achieved the enhancement of hydrogen production through Fe2+ addition. Zhang et al. (2017) increased hydrogen production from 158.0 mL H2/g glucose to 217.4 mL H2/g glucose by adding 200 mg/L Fe2+. Dhar et al. (2012) achieved highest hydrogen generation of 169.2 mL H2/g glucose with 500 mg/L Fe2+ addition. Yang and Wang (2018) obtained 72.8 mL/g-dry grass with 400 mg/L Fe2+ supplementation. Literature research shows that different optimum Fe2+ dosages were obtained in different studies, which may due to different substrate or inoculum sources adopted. Different from the above mentioned substrate, macroalgae is rich in triglyceride, trehalose, fucoidan and glycogen, hydrolysate of which mainly contains glucose, xylose and glycerol. Due to the different substrate composition, the optimal Fe2+ dosage for other substrates may provide little reference to macroalgae. Furthermore, the effect of Fe2+ on macroalgae fermentation was rarely reported, and the mechanisms of enhanced hydrogen production by Fe2+ supplementation is not clear yet. Besides, the interactive effects among various factors, like energy recovery efficiency, metabolites formation as well as dominant microbes are indistinct. Crucial effective factors are usually unclear, making the optimization process laborious. Thus, more studies concerning macrolagae fermentation are needed to fill the knowledge gaps. The effect of Fe2+ supplementation on macroalgae dark fermentation is examined in this study. The impact of different Fe2+ dosages on hydrogen generation, biomass degradation, metabolites formation and microbial distribution was examined. Microbial interactions were investigated by a microbial network analysis. The correlations among hydrogen production, Fe2+ concentration, critical microbes and metabolites were further explored to reveal the mechanisms of enhanced hydrogen production from macroalgae by Fe2+."
1,Material and methods,
2,Inoculum and macroalgal biomass,"2.1 Inoculum and macroalgal biomass Digested sludge gathered from a sewage wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum. Total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) of the digested sludge were 868.8 ± 56.3 mg/L and 342.1 ± 10.2 mg/L, respectively. Before inoculation, digested sludge was boiled for 15 min to eliminate hydrogen-consuming microbes. Macroalgae Laminaria japonica was obtained from a market. The macroalgal biomass was washed for 3 time to eliminate the salt absorbed on the surface, placed in drying oven at 80 °C for 48 h. Then, the dried macroalgal biomass was comminuted, only powders can be sieved by an 18-mesh screen were kept. Characteristics of macroalgal biomass were the same as given in ref. (Yin and Wang, 2018). Before being used as substrate, 12.5 g-VS/L of macrogalae biomass was pretreated by 1% H2SO4 at 121 °C for 30 min to accelerate the hydrolysis process (Yin and Wang, 2018)."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup Experiments were conducted in batch mode. 80 mL and 20 mL of pretreated macroalgae mixture and inoculum were added in 150 mL glass bottles, respectively, making a working volume of 100 mL with 10 g-VS/L substrate and 20% inoculum. FeSO4·7H2O was added, making Fe2+ concentrations in each bottles were 0, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg/L, respectively. Before the fermentation, initial pH of all bottles were set as pH 7.0 ± 0.2 with 5 M HCl and NaOH. Oxygen present in bottles were eliminated by flushing nitrogen gas for over 3 min. Fermentation process was carried out in a shaking bath at 36 °C, 120 r/min. A bottle free of Fe2+ supplementation and fermentation was set as blank. All tests were carried out in triplicate."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Biogas volume was monitored by water displacement method. Composition of hydrogen was assayed by a gas chromatograph (112A, Shanghai, China). Dynamic analysis of hydrogen generation was carried out by Modified Gompertz model (Eq. (1)). (1) H = P · exp - exp λ - t · R m · e / P + 1 TS, VS, total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of digested sludge and macroalgae were measured by standard method. An elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical CE 440, UK) was adopted to determine the contents of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen in macroalgal biomass. As to the soluble matters, liquid samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 8 min, and filtered through 0.45-um membranes. Modified Lowry method was adopted to determine the protein content, and phenol–sulfuric acid method for the measurement of polysaccharides. Monosaccharides, alcohols and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were quantified by a HPLC (Shimadzu LC-20AD, Tokyo, Japan). Concentration of Fe2+ was measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer method. Heating value of feedstock and all detected products were employed for the energy analysis. According to the modified Dulong Formula (Eq. (2)), total heating value of macroalgal biomass was determined to be 13.74 kJ/g VS (Nizami et al., 2009). (2) Heating value kJ / g VS = 0.337 C + 1.419 H - 0.125 O + 0.02326 N Heating values of products in gas and liquid phase are as follows (kJ/mol): hydrogen (286), xylose (2339), arabinose (2339), glycerol (1682), acetic acid (874), butyric acid (2184), propionic acid (1527), formic acid (254) and lactate acid (1362). To explore the possible relationships among parameters including: Fe2+ dosage, hydrogen production, dominant microbes and metabolites, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted using R software."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis Samples including the mixture of treated macroalgae and inoculum before fermentation, the sediments of test groups free of Fe2+ supplementation, and highest cumulative hydrogen production (CHP) after fermentation, were collected for microbial community analysis. Soil DNA extraction kit was adopted for DNA extraction. PCR amplification was conducted using the universal primers, and V4-V5 region was targeted. PCR conditions were the same as given in (Yin and Wang, 2016). A PCR based sequencing was performed in Illumina MiSeq PE250 platform. A similarity threshold of 97% was applied to define the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). α-Diversity was used to indicate the microbial diversity abundance, indices including Sobs, Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, and coverage were used. β-Diversity was elucidated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis to show the diversity between different samples. The microbial association network was proposed following Faust et al. (2015). Species with OTU abundances over 10% and 90% in all three samples were accounted for the microbial network analysis. CoNet app was used for the network construction."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of Fe2+ on hydrogen generation from macroalgae,"3.1 Effect of Fe2+ on hydrogen generation from macroalgae To examine the optimum Fe2+ dose for hydrogen production from macroalgae, effect of Fe2+ doses ranged from 0 to 800 mg/L on CHP was explored, volume of produced hydrogen was recorded every two hours during the fermentation process, and dynamic analysis was carried out according to the CHP along with time. No methane was detected throughout the fermentation process. The accumulation of hydrogen started at 10–20 h, and terminated in 26 h (Fig. 1 ). Only 4 mL/100 mL hydrogen was obtained in control test, and CHP was significantly increased to 8 mL/100 mL by adding 100 mg/L of Fe2+. Then, with a further increase of Fe2+ dose to 200 mg/L, CHP was expressively increased to 23 mL, and the highest CHP of 25 mL/100 mL was achieved in test group with 400 mg/L Fe2+ addition (6.25 times of control test). Demonstrating that CHP from macroalgae can be significantly enhanced by Fe2+ addition. Similarly, Camacho (2018) discovered a positive symbiotic effect between iron corrosion and hydrogen production during fermentation. This positive effect of Fe2+ on hydrogen generation from macroalgae may be attributed to several aspects. Besides the stimulating effect to microbial hydrogen-producing activity and functional gene expression, as mentioned in introduction, the addition of Fe2+ remedied the deficiency of macroalgal biomass as substrate for hydrogen production. Macroalgae is deficient in iron, but rich in sulfur (Suutari et al., 2015). Iron deficiency restricts the hydrogen production from both aspects mentioned above, and sulfide has been known as an important inhibitory factor to microbes in fermentation systems. Hwang et al. (2009) found that when Fe2+ dose was 3–4 times of soluble sulfide, the inhibitory effect of sulfide could be entirely eliminated. Thus, the addition of iron to macroalgal biomass is necessary to supply Fe2+ essential for hydrogen production and release the sulfide inhibition. Test groups with 200–800 mg/L Fe2+ all showed good hydrogen production, and the optimum Fe2+ concentration for hydrogen production from macroalgae was determined to be 400 mg/L. Differently, Dhar et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2017) obtained optimum Fe2+ dose of 500 mg/L and 200 mg/L when glucose was used as substrate. Yang and Wang (2018) obtained same optimum Fe2+ dose for hydrogen production from grass, but the enhancement of hydrogen production (49.6%) was much weaker than that achieved in this study (625%). This may because of the different characteristics of grass and macroalgae. Grass is more easily hydrolyzed and rich in various metal ions, led a relative high hydrogen production for control test (Yang and Wang, 2018). The supplementation of Fe2+ mainly contributed to the enzyme activity and functional gene expression. While macroalgae characterized to be deficient in iron and rich in the hydrogen-producing inhibitor sulfur, little hydrogen was produced in control test. The supplementation of Fe2+ not only promoted microbial activity, but also eliminated the sulfide inhibition, led to significant stimulation to hydrogen production. Thus, it can be concluded that both optimum Fe2+ dose and the enhancing effect are dependent on substrate sources adopted. Based on the CHP along with time, dynamic analysis was carried out by Modified Gompertz model. Parameters including, lag time (λ), maximum HPR (Rmax), and CHP potential (P) were obtained (Table 1 ). With the increase of Fe2+ dose, λ decreased gradually, indicating the hydrogen production metabolism can be stimulated by Fe2+. When 800 mg/L Fe2+ was added, time required for the system start up decreased to 57% compared with control test. Both Rmax and P increased with the increasing amount of Fe2+ addition and then showed a slight decrease, representing a superfluous Fe2+ may inhibit the continuous hydrogen production. Highest hydrogen yield (HY) based on total VS added in the system was determined to be 19.47 mL/g VSadded."
8,Effect of Fe2+ on organics degradation and VFA formation,"3.2 Effect of Fe2+ on organics degradation and VFA formation The accumulation of hydrogen was accompanied with biomass degradation and metabolites formation. Change of VS after fermentation was studied to show the effect of Fe2+ on macroalgal biomass degradation. Parameters in liquid phase including SCOD, Fe2+, polysaccharides and protein were examined to reveal the degradation and hydrolysis process during fermentation. Furthermore, VFA formed during fermentation was explored to uncover the effect of Fe2+ on dominant fermentation type during macroalgae fermentation. Hydrogen accumulated with biomass degradation and metabolites formation. Fig. 2 A exhibits that highest degradation efficiency (DE) of VS was obtained in control test without Fe2+ addition. VS DE significantly decreased with the addition of Fe2+, reached lowest (4.3%) at Fe2+-400 mg/L, and increased slightly with a further increase of Fe2+ doses. This may because of the stimulated microbial reproduction as well as the restricted biomass hydrolysis by Fe2+. Studies found that Fe2+ has a great effect on Pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase formation and activity, which is responsible for the anabolism, and result in biomass formation (Jr et al., 1966). Camacho et al. (2018) also observed the decrease of VS DE in iron supplemented groups. On the other hand, Fe2+ could detrimentally bind to cellulase or block active site on cellulose to inhibit the hydrolysis (Kim et al., 2001). Tejirian and Xu (2010) discovered a connection between the inhibitory effects and redox. They found that electrons from the reducing ends of organics can be shuttled by ferrous and ferric ions, thus restricted organics from oxidative hydrolysis. DE of SCOD were all over 33% except for the group with 800 mg/L Fe2+, indicating the degradation of soluble organics was more resistant to Fe2+ inhibition. It worth mentioning that although Fe2+ caused inhibitory effects on biomass hydrolysis and substrate DE, its contribution to oxidants block also promoted the formation of molecular hydrogen. Differently, Yang and Wang (2018) found that highest VS removal was consistent with highest CHP in iron added groups, which may because more easily hydrolyzed grass was adopted in their study. After fermentation, concentration of soluble Fe2+ decreased slightly, most of the added Fe2+ still remained as soluble Fe2+ in the system (Fig. 2B). The decrease may be contributed by microbial absorption and precipitation by other elements like sulfide. Largest difference of 138.6 mg/L Fe2+ was observed in Fe2+-400 mg/L group. This phenomenon indicates the microbial utilization of Fe2+ is a penetration process, much more amount of Fe2+ is needed to be present in the system than it is actually utilized. Macroalgae Laminaria japonica was rich in polysaccharides (10–61%) and protein (12–55%) (Wang and Yin, 2017). During the fermentation process, macroalgal biomass can be further hydrolyzed, releasing polysaccharides and protein molecules into liquid phase. While released organic nutrients can be consumed for microbial metabolism. Thus, change of soluble polysaccharides and protein after fermentation reflected whether hydrolysis or degradation effect was dominant during the fermentation (Fig. 2C). Decrease of polysaccharides in control group and Fe2+-400 mg/L group was observed, indicating more polysaccharides was utilized in these two groups than generated. Big consumption of polysaccharides in Fe2+-400 mg/L group was accompanied with high CHP and VFA formation (Fig. 2D). Considering the low VS degradation, polysaccharides in Fe2+-400 mg/L group were consumed for hydrogen production metabolism and microbial growth. As to the control test, a pretty high VS degradation rate was observed. Since no methane was detected in the biogas, the degraded VS was converted to either CO2 or soluble organics. SCOD in control test was not significantly higher than the other groups, indicating quite amount of organics were mineralized. Soluble protein in all groups all increased after fermentation, and the content of protein increased with the increase of Fe2+ dose, indicating more proteins were solubilized than consumed during hydrogen production process, and Fe2+ is helpful to the protein releasement. Metabolism pathways during fermentation can be illustrated by VFA formation (Fig. 2D). Acetate-type fermentation was dominant with highest acetate formation in all groups except control test. Highest total VFA was achieved in Fe2+-600 mg/L group, showing Fe2+ dose of 600 mg/L was more beneficial for VFA accumulation. Similarly Dhar et al. (2012) explored effect of 0–500 mg/L Fe2+ on hydrogen production from glucose, with acetate/butyrate ratio of 1–3, and highest total VFA was observed at Fe2+-500 mg/L group. However, Zhang et al. (2017) also produced hydrogen from glucose, found that Fe2+ added groups were dominated by butyrate-type fermentation. Thus, metabolism pathways are not only affected by Fe2+, but also substrate composition and inoculum source. From the difference in substrate degradation, change of soluble organic nutrients and soluble metabolites distribution, it can be concluded that Fe2+ had great effect on microbial metabolism from both aspects of biomass hydrolysis and hydrolysate utilization."
9,Effect of Fe2+ on products distribution and energy conversion,"3.3 Effect of Fe2+ on products distribution and energy conversion Products including hydrogen, residual TCOD, residual SCOD, VFA and monose in liquid phase were examined to explore the effect of Fe2+ on products distribution after fermentation. Then, energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of soluble metabolites and hydrogen was calculated based on the heating values to reveal the energy recovery from the fermentation process. An overview of various Fe2+ doses induced metabolic shifts is given by a COD-based analysis (Fig. 3 ). Biomass occupied the highest percentage in all groups with Fe2+ supplementation, which may because of the microbial growth during fermentation. Similarly, Palomo-Briones et al. (2017) observed biomass content of 10–61% when lactose was used as substrate. Lay et al. (2010) and Jung et al. (2010) also observed high biomass yields of 38% and 46%, respectively. Besides, the low hydrolysis efficiency of macroalgal biomass also contributed to high biomass content, suggesting the hydrolysis was still the rate-limiting step in dark fermentation even though substrate was pretreated. Highest hydrogen content obtained in this study was 1.6% in 400 mg/L-Fe2+ group, which was 80 times of control test. Except for biomass, a higher conversion from substrate to hydrogen could be achieved when pure sugars are used as substrate. Palomo-Briones et al. (2017) obtained highest hydrogen content of 8% from lactose. Our previous studies achieved hydrogen yield of 11.9–17.8% from glucose (Yin and Wang, 2016). Monose is more easily used for hydrogen production. Contents of monose in Fe2+ added groups were significantly lower than control. The accumulation of monose in control group further proved the better hydrolysis of macroalgae without Fe2+ addition. Soluble metabolites accounted for quite a high percentage of total COD at the end of fermentation. The other soluble metabolites mainly included alcohols, long-chain fatty acids and some non-biodegradable hydrolysates. An obvious higher occupation of total soluble metabolites and acids was attained in Fe2+ added groups than control. Since quite an amount of substrate was turned to microbial growth and byproducts other than hydrogen generation, taking hydrogen as the only product from dark fermentation is neither economically nor practically applicable. Furthermore, discharge of these organics into environment is detrimental to the environment. On the other hand, byproducts like VFA and alcohols can be used as low-cost carbon sources. For example, the supplement carbon sources for denitrification in sewage treatment plant, substrates for methane fermentation system and photo fermentative hydrogen production (Montiel Corona and Razo-Flores, 2018). Furthermore, studies have found that VFA and alcohols are potential precursors for biofuels, like chain-elongation from short-chain VFA for valuable long-chain fatty acids (Yin et al., 2018), the biological production of potential surrogates for gasoline and other fuels generation reviewed by Weber et al. (2018). Thus, more attentions worth being paid on the metabolites separation and collection. To further illustrate the energy value recoverable from dark fermentation system, energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of soluble metabolites and hydrogen detected in this study was demonstrated (Fig. 4 ). Groups with Fe2+ addition all showed higher total ECE than control test. Highest ECE of 15.8% was achieved in Fe2+-600 mg/L, which was 2.24 times of control test. However, over 80% of total substrate energy was still not determined. Besides the energy loses for microbial activity, a large amount of energy was deposited in microbial biomass and residual macroalgae. Thus, ECE could be enhanced from two aspects: limitation of microbial reproduction and further hydrolysis of macroalgal biomass. The amount of biomass in a system is usually maintained through microbial immobilization, and systems with immobilized microbes could achieve a more stable hydrogen production. Our previous study reported a significant advantage in hydrogen generation efficiency of immobilized system over suspended system (Yin et al., 2018). Hydrolysis of macroalgae could be enhanced during both pretreatment and fermentation. Like exploring more efficient pretreatment methods in disrupting macroalgae cells (Wang and Yin, 2017), and inoculating some functional microbes or enzymes in fermentation system. ECE of hydrogen could be enhanced by multi-stage fermentation, like hydrogen-methane fermentation, dark-photo hydrogen fermentation etc. (Liu et al., 2006)."
10,Microbial analysis,"3.4 Microbial analysis Sediments from blank group, groups with Fe2+-0 mg/L and Fe2+-400 mg/L after fermentation were collected for microbial analysis. Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indexes were studied to reveal the α-diversity. Microbial communities were examined at species level. Microbial network was constructed to represent the interactions between different species. Table 2 demonstrates theα-diversity of three samples. The obtained results of three samples were all reliable with a high coverage of over 0.99. Sobs refers to the number of OTUs that is actually measured. Microbial community before fermentation owned the highest Sobs of 167, and the number significantly decreased to 59 and 87 for samples after fermentation. Indicating some species were eliminated during the fermentation process, only the species adapted to the dark fermentation environment survived. Community richness of three samples exhibited same trend (Chao1). Shannon and Simpson reveal the microbial diversity, which were calculated considering both community richness and evenness. Microbial community before fermentation showed the highest microbial diversity with biggest Shannon and smallest Simpson. Fe2+-400 mg/L showed higher community richness (higher Sobs and Chao1) but lower community diversity (smaller Shannon and bigger Simpson) than Fe2+-0 mg/L, indicating Fe2+-400 mg/L group had more active species, and formed obvious dominant microflora. Microbial distribution of three groups were shown at species level (Fig. 5 A). The microbial distribution varied a lot in three samples, indicating both fermentation process and Fe2+ supplementation could bring significant change in microbial diversity. Before fermentation, besides the dominant species of Clostridium butyricum (31.0%), Bacterium sp. (14.3%) and Enterobacter sp. (13.9%), over 20 species were diversely distributed. After fermentation without Fe2+ supplementation, proportions of Exiguobacterium sp., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Clostridium stricto 13 significantly enhanced from less than 3.0% to 29.0%, 24.5% and 23.4%. Exiguobacterium sp. was reported to be efficient in hydrolysing lignocellulolytic materials (Vijayalaxmi et al., 2013), with lactate as main product during anaerobic fermentation (Jiang et al., 2013). Lactate is widely accepted as unfavourable metabolites during biohydrogen production (Palomo-Briones et al., 2017), which may be the reason of low CHP obtained in Fe2+-0 mg/L group. Acinetobacter lwoffii belongs to genus Acinetobacter, which are important soil organisms. Genus Acinetobacter is widely observed to be predominant in dark fermentation systems using hemicellulose rich biomass as substrate, like macroalgae Saccharina japonica (Palomo-Briones et al., 2017) and vegetable wastes (Kumar et al., 2014). Furthermore, genus Acinetobacter has been widely reported to be responsible for the mineralization of organic compounds (Wang et al., 2018), which proved the high VS degradation efficiency in Fe2+-0 mg/L group. As to Fe2+-400 mg/L group, Clostridium butyricum remained predominant and the proportion further enhanced to 67.2%, followed by Ruminococcus gnavus (24.2%). Other species were all less than 2%. Both the dominant strains have been widely reported as efficient hydrogen producers, indicating Fe2+ supplementation considerably promoted the reproduction of hydrogen producers. The significant enrichment of C. butyricum and R. gnavus may due to two aspects: on the one hand, Fe2+ supplementation supplied adequate elements for the synthesis of ferredoxin and hydrogenase, which are all important components of both C. butyricum and R. gnavus. On the other hand, Fe2+ supplementation promoted the expression of crucial genes encoded hydrogenases, like gene hydA from C. butyricum (Wang et al., 2008), gene HydA2, HydABC and HydS from genus Ruminococcus (Zheng et al., 2014), resulted in bubbling production of hydrogen. The formed high hydrogen pressure in the system caused inhibitive effect to low hydrogen-tolerant microbes, like microbes responsible for biomass hydrolysis and some hydrogen producers (Junicke et al., 2015). However, microbes with gene HydA2 and Aad could maintain the microbial growth in high hydrogen pressure environment (Zheng et al., 2014). Similar phenomenon was also observed by Yang and Wang (2018). Significant different microbial communities of three samples indicating the enhancement of CHP from macroalgae by Fe2+ addition was not only due to the optimized iron concentrations, but the enhanced microbial distributions for hydrogen production. Explorations of microbial interactions can provide a reference for bio-augmentation and synthetic microbial community design. Based on the data of three samples, microbial network at species level was constructed to demonstrate the possible microbial interactions (Fig. 5BC). The size of nodes represents the species abundance, and different colors represent different species. The positive correlation is demonstrated by red lines and negative correlations were displayed with green lines. Species with more lines are more closely related to others. Fig. 5B shows 51 species belonging to 12 phyla. Cooperative interactions were dominant in hydrogen production from macroalgae system with more red lines. The cooperation may include supplying hydrolysate as carbon sources, eliminating product-inhibition through metabolites consumption, preserving strict anaerobic through oxygen consumption etc. (Hung et al., 2011). The exclusive interactions happened among phylum Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Synergistetes, Cloacimonetes and Atribacteria. The competitive interactions may because of the different suitable environment and the competition for substrate. Differently, Palomo (2017) produced hydrogen from lactose, and the exclusive interactions accounted for over 80% of microbial connections. The difference may due to the different substrate source. Pure sugars are easier biodegradable than biomass, making substrate competition more prevalent. While compositions of biomass are much more complex, cooperation of different microbes is usually necessary to achieve an efficient degradation. Fig. 5C shows 9 species belonging to 2 phyla. The dominant species in Fe2+-0 mg/L group (Exiguobacterium sp., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Clostridium stricto 13) and Fe2+-400 mg/L group (Clostridium butyricum and Ruminococcus gnavus) all showed positive correlations between each other. However, negative correlations were observed between dominant species in Fe2+-0 mg/L group and Fe2+-400 mg/L group: Exiguobacterium sp., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Clostridium stricto 13 were all negatively correlated with both Clostridium butyricum and Ruminococcus gnavus. Indicating mutually exclusive microflora were formed in this two groups after fermentation. Significant difference in microbial distribution between Fe2+-deficient and Fe2+-supplemental groups reveals that Fe2+ is a vital factor for macroalgae fermentation system."
11,Correlation factors analysis,"3.5 Correlation factors analysis The relationships among factors including hydrogen production, Fe2+ concentration, relative abundances of microbial groups and metabolites were revealed by Principal components analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Then, the Spearman correlation heatmap was adopted to comprehensively analyze the correlations between dominant species and various products. As demonstrated by the Principal components analysis (PCA) (Fig. 6 A), hydrogen production and Rmax were closely related with Fe2+, species Clostridium butyricum 5521 and Ruminococcus gnavus, while species Exiguobacterium sp., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Clostridium stricto 13 dominant in Fe2+-0 mg/L group were all located far away from hydrogen production. Among the VFA, lactate was more closely correlated with hydrogen production. Since the VFA formed during fermentation was dominated by acetate and butyrate (Fig. 4), acetate and butyrate were selected for further analysis. The specific correlations among these factors were further explored by the Redundancy analysis (RDA) (Fig. 6B). The acute angle between two arrows means a positive correlation while obtuse angle indicates a negative correlation. Fe2+, acetate and butyrate were all positively correlated with CHP, and Fe2+ was more relevant with CHP with smallest angle, followed by acetate. This is consistent with the theory that 4 mol H2/mol glucose could be obtained through acetate-type fermentation while 2 mol H2/mol glucose could be achieved through butyrate-type fermentation. Species Clostridium butyricum, Ruminococcus gnavus dominant in Fe2+-400 mg/L group were all positively related with CHP and acids formation, while species Exiguobacterium sp., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Clostridium stricto 13 were all negatively correlated with CHP. A comprehensive analysis of the correlations between dominant species and various products is revealed by the Spearman correlation heatmap (Fig. 6C). Clostridium sensu stricto 1 showed a significant positive correlation with CHP, and Candidatus Caldatribacterium sp. demonstrated a significant negative correlation with CHP. These two species showed opposite correlation with formate, indicating the accumulation of formate was not favorable for hydrogen production. Species stimulating or suppressing the acetate accumulation had the same effect to butyrate, while they are not significantly correlated with CHP. Species favorable for lactate accumulation were adverse to the CHP. Thus, to achieve a high CHP, the accumulation of both formate and lactate should be avoided to the utmost, while acetate-type and butyrate-type fermentation are recommended."
12,Conclusions,"The effect of Fe2+ supplementation on hydrogen generation from macroalgal biomass was studied. A highest CHP of 25 mL/100 mL corresponded with hydrogen yield of 19.47 mL/g VSadded was obtained with 400 mg/L Fe2+ addition. It was observed that Fe2+ supplementation resulted in an enrichment Clostridium butyricum and Ruminococcus gnavus specialized in hydrogen production, while Fe2+ deficiency induced dominance of Exiguobacterium sp., Acinetobacter lwoffii and Clostridium stricto 13, which favoured biomass hydrolysis and mineralization. Overall, it was suggested that Fe2+ is a vital factor for macroalgae fermentation by determining the microbial community structure and consequently affecting the metabolic pathways."
