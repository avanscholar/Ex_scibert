0,Introduction,"Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important because of depleting of petroleum reserves and mounting environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel utilization. In this sense, the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier has been largely encouraged over the last years. Nowadays nearly 95% of the world hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels [1], thus, it is necessary to find renewable sources to produce hydrogen. Biomass is a promising source for hydrogen production due to the carbon neutral nature with environmental benefits. Gasification and steam reforming have been widely investigated for conversion of biomass to hydrogen, but these processes involve high temperatures and many side reactions, which decrease the hydrogen selectivity [2,3]. Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) for production of hydrogen, first developed by the Dumesic group [4], is an advantageous technology for feedstocks such as sugars, alcohols and polyols, because it is carried out at low temperatures, reducing the cost of the process and minimizing undesirable decomposition reactions. Moreover, it produces H2 and CO2 in a single reactor with low levels of CO, which is important for fuel cell applications [5]. Several biomass-derived oxygenated compounds have been used in APR process, such as methanol, sorbitol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol [4–9]. Glycerol is of particular interest because it is obtained as a by-product of biodiesel production by transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. The transesterification reaction produces approximately 110 kg of glycerol per ton of biodiesel [10]. With increase in production of biodiesel, an excess of glycerol is expected in the world market and therefore, it is essential to find useful applications for glycerol. One of the promising ways to utilize this diluted glycerol from biodiesel plants is to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen generation by APR of glycerol takes place according to the Eq. (1): (1) C3H8O3 + 3H2O → 3CO2 + 7H2 Noble metal catalysts are commonly used to carry out the APR at small scales because they are more active and less susceptible to carbon deposition than non noble metal catalysts [6–8]. However, large scale reforming processes use Ni-based catalysts that are far cheaper and more available than noble metals. A good catalyst for APR process has to be active in the cleavage of C–C bonds and water-gas shift reaction, but has to inhibit the cleavage of C–O bond and methanation reactions [4–6,11]. Ni shows a good activity for C–C scission, but it also exhibits high rates of methanation [5]. Cu, on the other hand, is inactive for C–C bond cleavage but has high activity for water-gas shift reaction, thus favoring the selectivity to hydrogen. In the present work Ni and Cu were selected to be included in catalyst formulations applied to glycerol reforming in order to obtain high activity and selectivity to hydrogen. Hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTLCs) or layered double hydroxides, also known as anionic clays, have a lamellar structure with alternating positively charged mixed metal hydroxide sheets and negatively charged interlayer anions along with water molecules [12]. Thermal treatments of HTLCs give a stable, high surface area, homogeneous mixture of oxides with very small crystal size, which by reduction results in high metallic dispersion. Ni–Mg–Al mixed oxides prepared from hydrotalcite precursors have been successfully used as catalysts for various reactions, including reforming and oxidation of methane [13–15] and ethanol reforming [9,16]. On the other hand, hydrotalcite-derived Cu–Mg–Al catalysts exhibit high activity for water-gas shift reaction [17]. To our knowledge, Ni–Cu–Mg–Al catalysts derived from hydrotalcites have not been investigated in APR of glycerol yet. In this context, the objective of this work is to study Ni–Cu catalysts prepared from hydrotalcite precursors in aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production. The effect of the Cu loading (0–20 wt%) on the catalytic activity for reforming reaction and hydrogen selectivity was investigated, correlating with structural and morphological properties of the catalysts. By-products formed in liquid phase were identified and the main reaction routes were proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Hydrotalcite-like compounds were prepared by coprecipitation method at room temperature. An aqueous solution containing appropriate amounts of nitrate precursors (Al/(Ni + Cu + Mg + Al) = 0.25 and [Ni + Cu + Mg + Al] = 1.5 M) was added dropwise to a vigorously stirred solution containing Na2CO3 and NaOH (CO3 2–/Al3+ = 0.375 and OH–/Al3+ = 6.3). The gel formed was aged for 18 h at 60 °C. The resulting solid was filtered, washed with distilled water (70 °C) until pH 7 and dried overnight at 100 °C. The Ni,Cu,Mg,Al-mixed oxides were produced by calcination of HTLCs under flowing air (60 mL min− 1), using a heating rate of 10 °C min− 1, from room temperature to 500 °C and keeping at this temperature for 2 h. The NiO loading in calcined samples was always 20 wt% and CuO loading was varied between 0 and 20 wt%. The samples will be referred to as Ni, Ni5Cu, Ni10Cu and Ni20Cu, according to CuO loading."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the synthesized samples was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Rigaku (RIX 3100) spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in a Rigaku Miniflex II X-ray diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator using CuKα radiation (40 kV). The measurements were carried out with speed of 2° min−1 and over the 2θ range of 5° and 90°. The textural characteristics, such as BET specific area and pore volume (BJH method), were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption at −196 °C in a Micromeritcs ASAP 2000. Prior to the analysis the samples were outgassed for 24 h at 200 °C. The reducibility of the catalysts was analyzed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), carried out in a microflow reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. The samples were firstly dehydrated at 150 °C under flowing Ar before the reduction. A mixture of 1.53% H2/Ar flowed at 30 mL min− 1 through the sample, raising the temperature at a heating rate of 10 °C min− 1 up to 1000 °C. The outflowing gases were detected by thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The reactions of APR of glycerol were carried out in an autoclave batch reactor of 600 mL with 450 rpm of agitation, using 400 mg of catalyst in 250 mL of 10 wt.% glycerol solution. Before the reaction, the reactor was purged with He to remove the air inside. The catalytic tests were performed at 250 and 270 °C, resulting in autogeneous pressures of 38 and 52 atm, respectively. The catalysts were reduced ex situ under 75 mL min− 1 of 20%H2/N2 up to 1000 °C, using a heating rate of 10 °C min− 1. Gas products were analyzed online by gas chromatography (GC-1000), equipped with a Hayesep D column and TCD. The products detected in the gas phase were H2, CH4, CO2 and CO. The selectivity to these products was calculated based on total moles produced in the gas phase, without considering water. In the liquid phase glycerol and by-products were quantified by a Shimadzu HPLC with Aminex HPX 87H column, using 0.005 M H2SO4 as eluent at 0.6 mL min− 1, and both UV and refractive index detectors. Conversion was calculated based on the moles of glycerol in the feed. Some liquid by-products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) using a Shimadzu QP2010 instrument with DB5 column."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the synthesized samples is presented in Table 1 and Table 2 . The composition of the as-synthesized samples is similar to those of the gel of synthesis, indicating an approximately complete incorporation of the cations in HTLC structure. The nickel loading of the sample without copper is slightly lower than the nominal value, which can be due to a small loss of nickel during washing. The XRD patterns of HTLC precursors (Fig. 1 A) exhibit characteristic planes of a well-crystallized HT in carbonate form (JCPDS 41–1428). The absence of other phases suggests that both Ni2+ and Cu2+ have isomorphically replaced Mg2+ cations in the brucite-like layers [9,18,19]. A clear improvement in the orderliness of the layer was noted with decreasing copper content, as indicated by both the increase in intensity and sharpness of (110) and (113) reflections, observed around 60 and 62°, respectively. This effect was expected due to Jahn-Teller distortion at higher concentrations of copper, leading to poor long-range ordering [20]. The lattice parameters a (cation–cation distance in the brucite-like layer) and c = 3c’(thickness of one brucite-like layer and one interlayer) were calculated based on the rhombohedral structure of hydrotalcites, as shown in Table 1. The lattice parameter a increases with copper content since the ionic radius of Cu2+ (0.73 Å) is larger than that of Mg2+ (0.65 Å) [19]. There is also a decrease of the parameter c with increasing copper content, which can be associated with a decrease in the interlayer distance, as suggested by Chmielarz et al. [21]. After calcination at 500 °C, the characteristic peaks of HT structure disappear and XRD patterns (Fig. 1 B) show the presence of poorly crystallized MgO periclase phase at 42.9° and 62.3° (JCPDS 45–946). The presence of NiO is only evidenced by the very small peak at 37.2°, since the other peaks of this phase are overlapped with MgO at 43.3° and 62.9° (JCPDS 47–1049). On the other hand, whatever the Cu content, no crystalline Cu-containing phase evolved and no well-defined spinel phase was noted. These results indicate that most of Ni, and Cu and Al oxides are well dispersed in MgO matrix, forming a solid solution, in accordance with the literature [18,20]. Kovanda et al. [22] reported that CuAl2O4 spinel was formed from Cu–Mg–Al hydrotalcites only after calcination above 800 °C. The lines of MgO are broader in the sample of lower Mg content, indicating a decrease in the size of the MgO crystal or an increase of the Al3+ incorporation in MgO since the ionic radius of Al3+ (0.54 Å) is smaller than those of Mg2+ (0.65 Å) and Ni2+ (0.72 Å) [23]. Moreover, the reflections of MgO-solid solution are shifted towards wider 2θ angles than in pure MgO, which also indicates the presence of foreign ions in the oxide lattice [24]. XRD analysis of the catalysts was also carried out after reduction at 1000 °C (Fig. 1 C). The reduction caused the formation of Ni0, with reflections at 44.5°, 51.9° and 76.4° (JCPDS 4–850), showing that ex situ activation was successful in reducing the active nickel phase. Metallic nickel is formed by the reduction of NiO and Mg–Ni–O solid solution [9]. It can also be observed the formation of spinel phases (MAl2O4 with M = Mg, Ni or Cu) and a small contribution of Cu0 at 43.3° for the sample with higher Cu loading (Ni20Cu). The Ni particle sizes were calculated by the Scherrer equation, using the peak at 2θ = 51.9°, which corresponds to the (200) plane of Ni fcc. The results are shown in Table 2, together with the corresponding Ni dispersion, estimated according to Anderson [25]. The use of HTLC precursors results in high dispersion of metal particles, as already observed by other authors [9,23,26]. The addition of copper greatly improved the Ni dispersion, which can be related to the increased reducibility of nickel in presence of copper, as will be shown by TPR. Textural characteristics of the as-synthesized samples (Table 1) showed that samples with higher amount of copper have larger BET surface areas, which is coherent with previous results [17]. Adsorption-desorption isotherms of nitrogen for all HTLCs (not shown) exhibited the type IV pattern with a broad hysteresis loop, characteristic of mesoporous materials. There was an increase in surface area and pore volume after calcination, as shown in Table 2, which can be related to the destruction of the layered structure (as observed by XRD) [9,17]. The surface areas of the Cu-containing samples after calcination are smaller than the Ni sample, which Kovanda et al. [22] related to the low sintering temperature of the copper oxides. TPR profiles of the catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2 . The sample without Cu showed only one reduction peak at 915 °C, which can be associated either to the reduction of Ni species on Mg–Ni–O solid solution [23] or to the reduction of NiAl2O4 spinel phase formed at temperatures higher than 800 °C during TPR analysis [18]. The Cu-containing samples exhibited two reduction peaks, one at low temperatures (340–370 °C), associated with the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0, and another at high temperatures (725–775 °C), related to reduction of Ni species. The low-temperature peak shifts to lower temperatures as the amount of Cu increases, suggesting that a large amount of Mg stabilizes a large amount of Cu in the solid solution, decreasing the reducibility of Cu2+ component [22]. On the other hand, the increase in Cu content decreased the reduction temperature of Ni species, which was attributed by Ashok et al. [27] to the spillover of hydrogen produced by Cu, accelerating the nucleation of the Ni metal. Table 3 shows the reduction degrees of CuO and NiO, calculated by integration of the first and second TPR peaks, respectively, considering the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 and Ni2+ to Ni0. The addition of Cu increased the reducibility of Ni2+ species, in accordance with Ashok et al. [27]. Another possibility is that the second reduction peak also corresponds to the reduction of copper in spinel phase (shown by XRD), as observed by Chmielarz et al. [28] and, in this case, the reduction of copper species would be 100% with an incomplete reduction of nickel species."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests The glycerol conversion of the Ni–Cu catalysts for aqueous-phase reforming at 250 and 270 °C is displayed in Fig. 3 . At 250 °C, the conversions increased with time up to about 6–8 h, while at 270 °C they increased continuously up to 10 h. The glycerol conversion increased by increasing the reaction temperature for all catalysts, as similarly observed in a previous study [29]. At 250 °C, Ni catalyst provided the best performance, starting at 16% of conversion and ending at approximately 34% after 12 h of reaction. The conversions with the copper containing catalysts were not much different from the Ni catalyst, with conversion of around 28% after 12 h. At 270 °C, all catalysts reached 59% of conversion, except Ni5Cu that showed a maximum conversion of 45%. The gas product distribution of the APR of glycerol at 250 °C is shown in Fig. 4 . H2, CO2, CH4, and CO were the only reaction products identified in the gas phase. The Ni5Cu and Ni10Cu catalysts showed the best performance in terms of H2 production, since they generated a H2 selectivity of about 90%, which remained practically constant during 12 h of reaction. The H2 selectivity for the other catalysts was about 80%. In relation to CO2, Ni5Cu exhibited the lowest selectivity, 3% in the beginning of the reaction and 8% at the end. The other catalysts presented CO2 selectivity of approximately 15%. CO selectivities were always below 3% and the maximum CH4 selectivity was 7% for Ni catalyst. The higher selectivity of Ni5Cu and Ni10Cu catalysts for production of hydrogen may be related to the lower Ni particle size. The lower Ni particle size decreases the number of clusters with multiple nickel atoms that are necessary for CO dissociation, which leads to formation of methane, thus resulting in higher H2 selectivity [29]. This effect is the same as the addition of Sn to nickel catalysts reported by the Dumesic group [11,30]. Wawrzetz et al. [31] showed that H2 and CO2 formation decreased in APR of glycerol with increasing Pt particle size. The aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol produces primarily H2 and CO2, according to reaction (1). The H2 selectivity obtained by Shabaker et al. [11] in APR of glycerol using Ni–Sn catalyst was 64%, at 265 °C, with 30% of CO2. These authors used a continuous reaction system, and the liquid effluent contained less than 50 ppm of by-products, such as aldehydes, alcohols and organic acids. In the present study, the H2 production varied between 80 and 90%, while CO2 was in the range of 5–30%, showing that H2/CO2 ratio was much higher than the stoichiometry of the reforming reaction, which indicates that the reaction is not purely APR, with occurrence of different side reactions. Our tests were conducted in a batch system, and high concentrations of liquid by-products were detected. Some of these by-products are formed by dehydrogenation reactions, such as lactic acid (with concentrations as high as 13 g L− 1) and acetaldehyde (concentrations up to 5 g L− 1), as will be shown later. Thus, for a glycerol concentration in the feed of 100 g L− 1, these by-products are formed in significant amounts and, consequently, the H2 formation by these side reactions is also significant. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the formation of CO is very low, indicating that the low temperature favors the water-gas shift reaction (Eq. (2)), since Ni has a moderate activity and Cu is one of the most active metals in this reaction [32]. Although it is well known that Ni catalysts have high activity in methanation reactions of CO and CO2 (Eqs. (3) and (4)) [5], the CH4 formation was not significant in the present study. The addition of Cu decreased the activity for methanation reaction, since Cu is not active for this reaction [33]. (2) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (3) CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O (4) CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O The main products detected in liquid phase for APR of glycerol at 250 °C were lactic acid, acetol (hydroxyacetone) and acetaldehyde. The formation of lactic acid is related to dehydrogenation of glycerol (Eq. (5)), as proposed by Ramirez-López et al. [34]. Acetol is produced by dehydration of glycerol (Eq. (6)), as already observed by many authors [31,35–37]. Acetaldehyde can be formed from dehydration of ethylene glycol (Eq. (8)), which is produced by decarbonylation/dehydrogenation of glycerol (Eq. (7)) [35]. Lactic acid was produced at higher concentrations (11–13 g L− 1) than acetol (2–4 g L− 1) or acetaldehyde (4–5 g L− 1). The high concentration of these by-products shows that formation of H2 by these side reactions is significant, justifying the high H2 selectivities (Fig. 4). (5) (6) (7) (8) Fig. 5 presents the product distribution for APR of glycerol at 270 °C. Ni catalyst generated an initial H2 selectivity close to 90%, which decreased to approximately 75% after 4 h of reaction, and remained constant until the end of the reaction. CO2 formation increased from 4% to 19% in 8 h of reaction and then decreased to 15%. This catalyst produced little CO, around 2% after 12 h of reaction. However, methane production was greater under these conditions, reaching a selectivity of 8%. Reactions performed with Ni10Cu and Ni20Cu catalysts presented H2 selectivity initially around 92% and decreased to approximately 53% after 12 h of reaction. Formation of CO2 was below 2% in the beginning of the reaction, increasing to 33 and 42% for Ni10Cu and Ni20Cu, respectively. Noteworthy is the product distribution for Ni5Cu catalyst: the H2 selectivity decreased from 85 to 13% after 12 h of reaction, while CO2 increased from 3 to 78%. The CO selectivity was approximately 5% for Ni10Cu and Ni20Cu catalysts, and reached 9% for Ni5Cu. The CH4 selectivity remained below 1% for all Cu-containing catalysts. The distribution of products at 270 °C followed the same trend for all catalysts: H2 production decreased with time, while CO2 increased, but this tendency is more pronounced for Cu catalysts, especially Ni5Cu. Hydrogen produced by APR can be consumed in the hydrogenation of products from dehydration of glycerol, as acetol, 3-hydroxypropanal [31], pyruvaldehyde and acetaldehyde [35]. The main products detected in liquid phase for APR of glycerol at 270 °C were lactic acid, acetol, acetaldehyde and also propylene glycol. Propylene glycol comes from hydrogenation of acetol (Eq. (9)) [31,36,38]. The production of lactic acid was higher for Ni catalyst (achieving 19 g L− 1), while acetol formation increases with Cu content: from 3 g L− 1 for Ni catalyst to 22 g L− 1 for Ni20Cu, at the end of the reaction. Small traces of other liquid by-products were detected by GC–MS, mainly for Cu-containing catalysts at long reaction times: 1,2 butanediol, cyclopentanone, 2,5 hexadione and 4-hydroxy-3-hexanone. (9) Propylene glycol was formed at higher concentrations on Cu-containing catalysts, which agrees with Dasari et al. [38] and Nakagawa and Tomishige [39], who showed that Cu is a better catalyst than Ni for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to propylene glycol. Meher et al. [40] showed specifically that Cu/Zn/Al mixed-oxide catalysts derived from hydrotalcite precursors have high activity in glycerol conversion to propylene glycol. Moreover, the production of propylene glycol increases with reaction time, while the H2 selectivity decreases, confirming the occurrence of hydrogenation reactions."
8,Conclusions,"Ni–Cu catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like compounds showed great potential to be used in aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol, with good activity and high selectivity to hydrogen. Ni catalyst (without Cu) showed higher glycerol conversions, despite its lower Ni dispersion. Ni5Cu catalyst presented the highest H2 selectivity at 250 °C, with the smallest amount of CO and CH4. However, this catalyst provided the least desirable performance at 270 °C because of low conversion and almost total consumption of hydrogen. The consumption of H2 is related to hydrogenation of acetol, formed by dehydration of glycerol, producing propylene glycol. Lactic acid and acetaldehyde were also formed in liquid phase, besides small traces of heavier by-products."
