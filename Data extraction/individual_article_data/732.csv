0,Introduction,"Ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol are two common polyhydric alcohols, showing the advantages of high energy densities (7.56 kWh L−3 and 6.4 kWh L−3) and boiling points (198 °C and 290 °C), as well as the low cost and easy transportation, which are desirable for feeding direct fuel cells (DFCs) [1,2]. However, the polyols oxidation reactions are usually complicated and sluggish on the anode [3,4], and thus Pt- and Pd-based nanocrystals (NCs) are adopted as anode catalysts to solve these problems [5,6]. PdPt nanowire networks were synthesized with the enhanced catalytic characters for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) [4]. Besides, single PdAuNi nanosponges were prepared with the increased catalytic performances for EGOR and GOR [7]. Meanwhile, hydrogen is also a kind of renewable clean energy to meet the increasing energy and environment requirement [8], owing to its high energy density (about 140 MJ kg–1), low pollutant emission and high efficiency [9]. Nowadays, hydrogen is usually produced by steam reforming process from fossil resources, where the by-product like CO2 is harmful to environment [10]. Alternatively, water electrolysis is a green strategy to produce hydrogen [11,12], where a qualified catalyst is essential to produce massive hydrogen quickly at a minimum overpotential and superior durability in practical water splitting systems [12]. Recently, Pt- and Pd-based nanocatalysts are the most efficient and practical catalysts because of their remarkable catalytic features for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [13,14]. Pt-Pd core-shell structures are widely applied in catalytic fields because of their enhanced selectivity, catalytic activity and tolerance to poisonous CO-like intermediates [15]. To date, several methods have been developed to fabricate novel Pt-Pd core-shell NCs [16], such as atomic layer deposition [17] and two-step seed-mediated epitaxial growth [18], which are relatively complex and time-consuming. Alternatively, one-pot wet-chemistry method is straightforward, which is widely used for synthesis of core-shell architectures recently [19]. It is known that the catalytic property of a catalyst is closely correlated with its size, shape and crystal structure [20], which would affect the surface area and expose different facets, leading to different atomic arrangements and density of atoms on the catalyst surface [21]. For example, Pt-Pd core-shell NCs were fabricated with scalable Pd thickness, displaying the higher oxidation current density and lower potential for oxygen reduction compared to home-made tiny Pt NCs [5]. In another example, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported star-shaped core-shell Pd@Pt NCs were prepared, which showed the improved catalytic characters for methanol oxidation in contrast to spherical PtPd alloy particles supported on rGO [22]. Sodium pyrrolidone carboxylate (PCA-Na) is a kind of green amino acid derivatives with carboxylate radical and pyrrole groups, which is widely used as humectant in cosmetic area for its good hygroscopicity (Fig. S1, supporting information, SI) [23]. Herein, PCA-Na was utilized for preparing prickly platinum-palladium core-shell nanocrystals (Pt@Pd NCs) by a seedless, simple, green and one-pot wet-chemical strategy. The electrocatalytic abilities of the obtained nanocrystals were examined by employing EGOR, GOR and HER as the model systems."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Pt@Pd NCs,"2.1 Synthesis of Pt@Pd NCs To prepare Pt@Pd NCs, 0.18 mL of PCA-Na (75 mM) was put into 9.00 mL of water, followed by mixing with 0.52 mL of H2PtCl6 (38.6 mM) and 0.20 mL of H2PdCl4 (100.0 mM) under stirring. Then, 0.10 mL of the hydrazine solution was drop-wise put into the above suspension whose color turned to dark quickly, accompanied by continually reacting for 1 h under stirring at 25 °C. The resultant precipitates were collected and fully washed with water and ethanol by centrifugation. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum for the following examination. In addition, individual H2PtCl6 and H2PdCl4 were used as the precursor for construction of solely Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) and Pd NPs, respectively, while the other experimental conditions remained the same."
3,Construction of Pt@Pd NCs modified electrode,"2.2 Construction of Pt@Pd NCs modified electrode For preparation of Pt@Pd NCs modified electrodes, 1 mg of the sample was mixed uniformly with 1 mL of water by ultrasonicating to get the homogeneous suspension (1 mg mL–1). Next, 6 μL of the suspension and 4 μL of the Nafion solution (0.05 wt.%) were successively dropped onto a glassy carbon-rotating disk electrode (RDE, Φ = 3 mm) or glassy carbon electrode (GCE, Φ = 3 mm), and dried in air naturally. The referenced Pt NPs, Pd NPs, commercial Pt black and Pd black catalysts modified electrodes were constructed via the identical process in the contrary experiments."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Firstly, the morphology and structure of the typical product were checked by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) measurements. As seen in Fig. 1 A, there are plenty of well-defined interconnected spherical particles with rough surfaces. The particle sizes are mainly located in the range from 70.3 to 112.5 nm, with a mean diameter of 95.87 nm. Additionally, the prepared crystals have high density of thorns on the external surfaces, as exhibited in the medium TEM image (Fig. 1B). There are numerous distinct atomic steps observed on the particle surface by the high-resolution TEM images of the sample (Fig. 1C–E), which would provide plenty of active sites accessible for catalysis [24]. Besides, the well-resolved lattice fringes are roughly 0.223 and 0.224 nm on the external thorns of the particles, corresponding to the (1 1 1) crystal planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) PtPd alloy, indicating the exposed facets here are predominated by the (1 1 1) crystal planes [25]. In addition, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED, Fig. 1F) pattern shows several discretely dotted rings from inner to outside, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the sample [26]. The elemental distribution and structural features of the particles were determined by the correlative HAADF-STEM-EDS mapping images (Fig. 2 ). Impressively, Pt atoms uniformly distribute over the core region and Pd atoms mainly emerge at the outer layer, verifying the formation of the Pt@Pd core-shell structure. These observations match well with the analysis from the line scanning profiles (Fig. 3 A). Also, the atomic ratio of Pt to Pd is measured to be 66.16:33.84 for the sample based on the energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) analysis (Fig. 3B). The surface chemical composition and valence state of Pt@Pd NCs were carefully examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [19]. By fitting the associated peaks, the strong couple emerged at 70.6 and 73.8 eV corresponds to metallic Pt0 of Pt 4f (Fig. 4 A), which is much larger than the pair of Pt2+ species (71.1 and 74.5 eV) [27]. Similarly, the peaks of Pd0 (337.2 and 342.5 eV) are primary in the Pd 3d orbit (Fig. 4B), which are much larger than those of Pd2+ species (337.8 and 343.1 eV) [28]. All these results indicate the efficient deoxidation of the metal precursors [29]. There are small peaks of Pt2+ and Pd2+ species appeared in the XPS spectra, which are originated from the PtO and PdO on the sample surfaces. The results are consistent with the previous work [30,31]. Meanwhile, the near-surface compositions were further calculated by the semi-quantitative analysis. The surface atomic percentage of Pt is around 1.6%, dramatically lower than that of Pd (98.4%), reflecting the formation of the Pt@Pd core-shell structures [19]. Fig. 5 exhibits the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of Pt@Pd NCs, employing bulk Pt (JCPDS-04-0802) and Pd (JCPDS-46-1043) as the references. Four representative diffraction peaks appear at the 2θ values of 40.1°, 46.5°, 68.0°, and 81.9°, which are well ascribed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (2 1 1) facets [32]. These peaks just show up between those of pure Pt and Pd, with the average lattice parameter of 3.906 Å. This value also emerges between bulk Pt (3.922 Å) and bulk Pd (3.889 Å). It means the formation of the PtPd alloy, rather than the simple mixture of Pt and Pd atoms [33]. Also, the peak intensity ratio of the (1 1 1) to (2 0 0) planes is about 2.38, which is dramatically larger than those of pure Pt (2.22) and Pd (2.28), showing the preferential growth of the crystals along the (1 1 1) directions [34]."
6,Formation mechanism,"3.2 Formation mechanism To investigate the formation mechanism of Pt@Pd NCs, the influence of PCA-Na on the morphology is investigated firstly. As shown in Fig. S2 (SI), insufficient PCA-Na (50 mM) leads to the generation of irregular and severely aggregated large particles with the mean diameter of 114.2 nm. Alternatively, when increasing the concentration of PCA-Na up to 100 mM, the particle surface becomes relatively smooth, accompanied by the disappearance of the prickly structures, owing to the isotropic growth instead of anisotropic growth along each facet in the presence of excess PCA-Na [35]. It confirms that PCA-Na plays an essential role as the structure director and capping agent in this synthesis. This is mainly ascribed to the strong interactions of the precursors with PCA-Na, coupled with the selective adsorption ability of PCA-Na on the (1 1 1) planes of the PtPd alloy [36]. Generally speaking, insufficient PCA-Na hardly works as the capping and structure-directing agents during the synthesis, while excess PCA-Na blocks the anisotropy growth of Pt@Pd NCs owing to the complete coverage of the crystal facets by the adjacent PCA-Na molecules. As illustrated in Fig. S3 (SI), single Pt NPs (A) and Pd NPs (B) were fabricated with PtCl6 2– and PdCl4 2– as the individual precursor in the contrary experiments, respectively. The prepared Pt NPs have the broad size distribution, without any thorn-like structures on the particle surfaces, unlike single Pd NPs with serious aggregation and partial thorn-like structures. These observations are different from Pt@Pd NCs in the typical process, showing the critical role of the coexisted precursors in the final products. All these phenomena prove the critical role of the coexistence of the two precursors in this case. To explore the formation mechanism of the core-shell structure, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to search how PCA-Na influence the reduction potentials of the precursors in the controlled experiments. As shown in Fig. S4 (SI), the reduction potentials of PtCl6 2– just have the slight downshifts before (0.31 V) and after the addition of PCA-Na (0.07 V). However, the reduction peak for PdCl4 2– completely disappears in the presence of PCA-Na. It means the extremely strong interactions between PdCl4 2– and PCA-Na in comparison to that of the Pt precursor with PCA-Na under the identical conditions. This is attributed to the strong chelating ability of PCA-Na with the Pd precursor. Thus, the Pt precursor is preferentially reduced relative to the Pd precursor, thanks to their different reduction potentials ranked in the order of PtCl6 2– > PdCl4 2– [37]. Taken together, Fig. 6 illustrates the formation mechanism of Pt@Pd NCs. Specifically, the positively charged groups (i.e. imino groups) of PCA-Na initially combine with the precursors in the reaction media [38]. Then, the chelated PtCl6 2– is firstly reduced to Pt atoms after the addition of the hydrazine hydrate solution, owing to its favorable reduction potential contrary to that of PdCl4 2– under the identical experimental conditions. The newly-generated Pt atoms would fuse together to form Pt core to reduce the interface free energy [39]. After the exhaustion of the Pt precursor, PdCl4 2– starts to be reduced and the freshly-formed Pd atoms evenly distributed around the original Pt core via the preferential deposition along the (1 1 1) facets under the guidance of PCA-Na. To this end, prickly Pt@Pd NCs are ultimately formed through the epitaxial growth along the (1 1 1) directions [40]."
7,Electrochemical properties,"3.3 Electrochemical properties The electrochemical performance of Pt@Pd NCs was firstly tested in 0.5 M KOH solution, taking the home-made Pt NPs and Pd NPs, commercial Pt black and Pd black as the referenced catalysts. For each catalyst, the integrated area of the anodic peak between −0.8 V and −0.5 V corresponds to the total charges required for the atomic hydrogen desorption from the catalyst (Fig. 7 A) [41]. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was measured by integrating the reduction charges of the surface platinum (or palladium) oxide in the backward scan [33]. As described in Fig. 7B, the ECSA (5.62 m2 g–1) of the Pt@Pd NCs is much higher than those of Pt NPs (2.55 m2 g–1), Pt black (4.67 m2 g–1) and Pd black (3.55 m2 g–1), while it is lower than Pd NPs (7.69 m2 g–1) for the abundant thorn-like structures on the Pd NPs. It is known that the DFCs have improved oxidation kinetics, low temperature and crossover of alcohols in alkaline electrolytes [42]. For fuel cell test, the CV curves of Pt@Pd NCs towards EG oxidation were recorded in 0.5 M KOH + 0.5 M EG (Fig. 8 A), taking Pt NPs, Pd NPs, Pt black and Pd black as the references. Obviously, the catalytic current density of Pt@Pd NCs (58.4 mA cm–2) is 3.5-fold, 1.2-fold, 2.3-fold and 2.4-flod enhancement relative to Pt NPs (16.6 mA cm–2), Pd NPs (47.2 mA cm–2), Pt black (25.8 mA cm–2) and Pd black (24.7 mA cm–2), respectively. The mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) are significant parameters to measure the intrinsic catalytic ability of a catalyst, which are defined by normalizing the peak current to the mass loading of the metals and ECSA [22], respectively. As displayed in Fig. 8B, the MA of Pt@Pd NCs (688.1 mA mg–1) is the largest among the catalysts, because the MA values are 195.6, 556.2, 304.0 and 291.1 mA mg–1 for Pt NPs, Pd NPs, Pt black and Pd black, respectively. This value is also higher than that of AuPd@Pd NCs (535.4 mA mg–1) [40]. At the same time, the SA of Pt@Pd NCs for EGOR (12.2 mA cm–2) is larger than those of Pt NPs (7.7 mA cm–2), Pd NPs (7.2 mA cm–2), Pt black (6.5 mA cm–2) and Pd black (8.2 mA cm–2). The durability is critical for a catalyst in fuel cells [43]. The long-term durable ability of the prepared catalyst was firstly checked by chronoamperometry (CA) at −0.22 V for 6000 s in 0.5 M KOH + 0.5 M EG (Fig. 8C). The Pt@Pd NCs catalyst has the highest catalytic current density among all the five catalysts. Besides, the CV curves of the catalysts were acquired for 500 cycles (Fig. S5, SI). Fig. 8D exhibits the variations in the peak currents densities. The peak current density of Pt@Pd NCs remains roughly 92.38% of its original value after 500 cycles, which outperforms Pt NPs (67.41%), Pt black (32.41%) and Pd black (69.74%), while it is similar to the single Pd NPs (91.89%). All these show the improved catalytic stability of the as-synthesized Pt@Pd NCs. The catalytic properties of Pt@Pd NCs for glycerol oxidation were further examined in 0.5 M KOH + 0.5 M glycerol (Fig. 9 A). It is noted that Pt@Pd NCs and pure Pd NPs catalysts only have sharp peaks at −0.15 V in the forward scan, but there is an extra small oxidation peak detected at 0.1 V for single Pt NPs. This phenomenon is due to the different reaction pathways on each catalyst. For Pd-based catalysts, glycerol is completely oxidized based on the below reaction: CH 2 OH - CHOH - CH 2 OH + 20 OH - ↔ 3 CO 3 2 - + 14 H 2 O + 14 e - However, glycerol fails to be directly oxidized to CO2 on Pt catalysts [44], which undergoes the partial oxidation of glycerol to C3 products (e.g. glyceric acid and tartronic acid) and the cleavage of the CC bond [45]. It means that the external Pd shells efficiently promote glycerol oxidation in alkaline media when compared to Pt counterparts [46]. Importantly, the peak current density of Pt@Pd NCs is about 28.4 mA cm–2, which is slightly stronger than Pd NPs (22.8 mA cm–2), but much larger than the other referenced catalysts, revealing the dramatically boosted catalytic ability of the Pt@Pd NCs catalyst. Fig. 9B exhibits the MA and SA values of the aforementioned catalysts towards glycerol oxidation. Impressively, the prepared Pt@Pd NCs catalyst has the biggest MA (334.5 mA mg–1) and SA (6.0 mA cm–2) in contrast to Pt NPs (97.8 mA mg–1 and 3.8 mA cm–2), Pd NPs (268.5 mA mg–1 and 3.5 mA cm–2), Pt black (190.9 mA mg–1 and 4.1 mA cm–2) and Pd black (202.7 mA mg–1 and 5.7 mA cm–2). The remarkably boosted catalytic activity of Pt@Pd NCs is ascribed to their specific prickly core-shell structures, as well as the synergistic effects between the bimetals. To explore the durability of Pt@Pd NCs towards GOR, the CA measurements were conducted at a settled potential of −0.27 V. The synthesized Pt@Pd NCs catalyst has the highest catalytic current density even after 6000 s, which is the highest among the catalysts (Fig. 9C). Meanwhile, the peak current density still remains about 93.92% of its initial value for Pt@Pd NCs even after 500 cycles (Fig. 9D), which is close to Pd NCs (94.50%), but much larger than those of Pt NCs (69.71%), Pt black (29.00%) and Pd black (75.26%) in the current conditions. The corresponding CV plots are provided in Fig. S6 (SI). All these stability tests manifest the extremely increased durability of the prepared nanocatalyst. The highly enhanced durability of Pt@Pd NCs towards polyhydric alcohols oxidation is attributed to the fact that Pd surface is effectively prevented from the poisoning CO-like intermediates, which shows the enhanced ability to resist the CO-like intermediated species [41,47]. Meanwhile, Pt-Pd core-shell frameworks have strong resistance ability against the poisonous intermediates, dramatically improving the stability and durability in fuel cells [15]. The HER catalytic activity of Pt@Pd NCs was evaluated in N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at the scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Fig. 10 A and B show the onset overpotential of 26 mV for Pt@Pd NCs and the overpotential of 52 mV to afford the catalytic current density of 10 mA cm–2. These values are both the lowest when compared to Pt NPs (28 and 53 mV), Pd NPs (70 and 100 mV), Pt black (36 and 60 mV) and Pd black (60 and 96 mV). Taking Pd-based NCs as a catalyst, there is a small peak always show up before the onset potential, which is originated from the reduction of the absorbed hydrogen on the catalyst surfaces [48], consistent with the previous reports [49]. Furthermore, the overpotential of Pt@Pd NCs is also lower than other Pd-based catalysts, such as AuPd NPs on carbon fiber paper (about 90 mV) [50] and PtPd alloy NPs embedded in nitrogen-rich graphene nanopores (58 mV) [51]. Tafel slope is a critical factor to test the inherent catalytic ability for HER [52], which describes the correlation of the activation over-potentials with the logarithm value of the current generated during HER. Fig. 10C shows the Tafel slope of Pt@Pd NCs with the value of 42 mV dec–1, which is close to Pt black (41 mV dec–1), but much larger than those of Pt NPs (47 mV dec–1), Pd NPs (83 mV dec–1) and Pd black (65 mV dec–1). The tremendously enhanced catalytic characters of Pt@Pd NCs in comparison to Pd NPs indicate the important role of the Pt core in the current research. The HER durability test of Pt@Pd NCs was conducted by CA with the applied potential of −50 mV (Fig. 10D). The current densities of Pt@Pd NCs, Pt NPs and Pt black catalysts have continuous decrease because the aggregation of the inevitable metal crystals [13]. The current density of the Pt@Pd NCs catalyst remains 61.4% of its original value after 8000 s, which is larger than those of Pt NPs (10.5%) and Pt black (36.1%), reflecting the substantially boosted durability of the synthesized catalyst. Moreover, the current densities of Pd NPs and Pd black catalysts almost show negligible changes because of their small initial current densities. In addition, the onset overpotential and the Tafel slope of Pt@Pd NCs for HER almost have no obvious change even after 500 cycles in acidic environment (Fig. S7, SI), displaying the increased durability of the catalyst."
8,Conclusions,"Herein, a facile and green method was developed for fabrication of prickly Pt@Pd NCs, where PCA-Na worked as the eco-friendly structuring directing and capping agents. The as-prepared nanocatalyst showed the enlarged ECSA, greatly enhanced catalytic ability and durability for EGOR (MA = 688.1 mA mg–1), GOR (MA = 334.5 mA mg–1) and HER (The Tafel value is 42 mV dec–1) in contrast with the contrary catalysts. The significantly boosted catalytic property was attributed to the special prickly core-shell structures and the synergistic effects between the bimetals. Based on the outstanding catalytic property, the fabricated Pt@Pd NCs would have bright applications in fuel cells and H2 production. This work provides a promising approach for controllable fabrication of other functional nanoparticles in fuel cells, catalysis and sensors."
