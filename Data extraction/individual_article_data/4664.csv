0,Introduction,"Rational design and selection of support is extremely important in heterogeneous catalysis in view of the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) [1–3]. The merits of mesoporous framework as support have been widely accepted owing to the facts that mass transfer and the accessibility to active sites for bulky compounds are greatly improved; the stability and sintering resistance of catalysts are enhanced [4,5]. Besides, the catalyst’s confinement effect in mesoporous frameworks is also useful for improving the selectivity and activity. The metal nanoparticles (NPs) confined in the supports always lead to unique characters, such as special surface electronic states, favorable chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity [6–9]. For instances, the Rh NPs confined inside carbon nanotubes displayed a striking enhancement of catalytic activity for ethanol production [10]. In addition to the mesoporous frameworks-induced confinement effect, the compositions of support have also testified to be very useful for modulating the catalytic performances [11,12]. Selective hydrogenation of organic substrates, such as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is crucial in the manufacture of flavors, pharmaceuticals [13–27]. Besides, selective cinnamaldehyde (CAL) hydrogenation is also an important model reaction for investigating the hydrogenation behaviors of CC and CO bonds, and the catalytic performances of the catalysts [25,26,28]. Considering the hydrogenation of CC bond is much more thermodynamically favorable, most efforts have been cast toward improving the selectivity of the desired product of cinnamyl alcohol (COL). Several strategies have been developed for enhancing the yields of COL, such as using bimetallic catalysts [14,28,29], controlling the sizes of metal NPs [30–32], modifying the surface via capping agents [15,21,25], introducing promoters [33,34], using supercritical liquid medium [35–38], tuning the composition of support [39], and so on. In hydrogenation of CAL, the adsorption energies and behaviors of CC and CO bonds were highly related to the sizes and exposed facets of metal NPs, components of support, SMSI, etc., and the adsorption mode of CAL on metal surface was confirmed to determine the hydrogenation selectivity. However, some questions have not been clarified yet, such as how does the phase component and surface defect site on the support affect the catalytic properties, which is still puzzling the researchers in this field. Therefore, the study on the influences of phase component of support and defect sites on the selective hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds is highly important and desired. The hydrogenation catalysts with TiO2 or SiO2 as support have been widely studied, but none of them gave satisfied results for the selective hydrogenation of CAL to cinnamyl alcohol (COL). In view of the rational mesoporous structures, enhanced thermal stability [40], mesoporous TiO2–SiO2 composite is expected to be a suitable support for CAL hydrogenation once the surface electron characters is optimized. In this work, a series of Pt/ordered mesoporous TiO2–SiO2 catalysts were prepared and studied to discover the influences of surface defects and SMSI on the selective hydrogenation of CAL. The adsorption behavior of reactant CAL could be altered dramatically, and it caused a large increase of reaction rate and selectivity of COL. SMSI and Ti2+ were demonstrated to be responsible for the enhanced catalytic performances. This work reveals the promoting role of Ti2+ in selective hydrogenation of CAL over the Pt/ordered mesoporous TiO2–SiO2. It provides new insights into the relationship between selective hydrogenation of CAL and SMSI. It is expected that these findings would be useful for designing the catalysts for selective hydrogenation of other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of ordered mesoporous TiO2–SiO2 composite,"2.1 Synthesis of ordered mesoporous TiO2–SiO2 composite In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.50g of tri-block copolymers EO106PO70EO106 (Pluronic F127), 0.60g of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) and 1.25g of KCl were dissolved in 50ml of 1M HCl at room temperature. After 1h stirring, given amount of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) were added to this solution (The Ti/Si mole ratio was 4:6). The synthesis composition F127/KCl/TEOS+TBT/TMB/HCl/H2O (in molars) was 0.00256/1.083/0.387/0.258/0.323/3.87 /100. A given amount of H2SO4 was added into the above solution to adjust the phases of TiO2. After stirring for 24h at room temperature, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and heated at 140°C for 24h. The as-made product was then washed by ethanol and water for three times, collected by centrifuge and dried at 50°C overnight. Finally, the product was calcined at 550°C for 6h."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts Catalysts with 2wt.% Pt-loading supported on the above ordered mesoporous TiO2–SiO2 supports, mesoporous SiO2, and TiO2(P25), were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. Aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 was added dropwisely to form support slurry. Then the slurry was dried in oven overnight. Prior to usage, the catalysts were reduced in pure H2 at 150°C for 2h with a heating rate of 2.5°C/min."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractmeter, using Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154nm). Nitrogen porosimetry measurement was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried on the VG Microtech 3000 Multilab. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were performed on a JEOL JEM-2010 instrument operating at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were carried on a scanning electron microscope (SEM Hitachi S-4800)."
5,Catalytic testing,"2.4 Catalytic testing The selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was performed in an 80-mL stainless steel reactor with an inner Teflon coating. The autoclave was charged with 0.2g catalysts, 10mL isopropanol and 4mmol cinnamaldehyde, then flushed with H2 for more than three times and pressurized to 4.0MPa. Then the reactor was put into the water bath, and preheated at 80°C for 15min. The reaction was recorded with starting the stirrer at a speed of 1300rpm. After reaction, the vessel was cooled to room temperature naturally, and the liquid phase was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 2010) equipped with a capillary column (Restek-50 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm,) and a flame ionization detector (FID)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization Ordered mesoporous TiO2–SiO2 supports (The Ti/Si ratio is 4:6) were successfully prepared through F127 as templates [4]. These mesoporous supports were denoted as MesoSiO2, MesoTiO2–SiO2-A or R or M, where the “A”, “R”, and “M” indicated that the phase of TiO2 was anatase, rutile and their mixtures, respectively. It is well known that the phase of TiO2 depends on the additives to the precursor solution and calcination temperature. In present work, the phases of the TiO2 were adjusted by simply controlling the proportion of sulfate and chloride ions [41,42]. Pure TiO2 support with similar porous structure failed to be obtained in present work. With F127 as template agent, titanium can be uniformly dispersed in the mesoporous frameworks via the assistance of TOSi bonds. It is proposed that the formation of the composites could undergo the hydrolysis, condensation and polymerization of the TEOS and TBT. It is well known that the hydrolysis and condensation rates of TEOS can be adjusted by acidity. Therefore, the synchronicity of hydrolysis and condensation of both TEOS and TBT achieved with the assistance of HCl during the hydrothermal procedures. The composites were composed of amorphous silica and small crystallized titanium oxides based on the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 1 . The wide diffraction peaks indicated the small crystalline size of TiO2 in the supports. The weak peaks centered at 39.7° in Fig. 1(d–f) can be indexed to the Pt NPs in the reduced catalysts. Contrast to MesoTiO2–SiO2, a drastically decline of TiO2 crystallinity in the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts took place during the impregnation and following reduction processes, as implied by the broadened peaks and decreased intensities. Fig. 2 shows the N2 sorption isotherms of the MesoSiO2, MesoTiO2–SiO2-M, MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, and MesoTiO2–SiO2-A. All these supports had similar ordered mesoporous structures, regardless of their composition and phases. The N2 sorption isotherms showed typical IV-type isotherm with an associated H2 type hysteresis loop indicating the presence of significant mesopores. The specific surface area for MesoSiO2, MesoTiO2–SiO2-M, MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, and MesoTiO2–SiO2-A, was 212, 394, 388, and 412m2/g, respectively. The introduction of Ti caused an increase of specific surface area, and a slight decrease of pore diameter, which agreed with the previous reports [11]. The average pore diameters in these supports were at a range of 5–8nm as evaluated by BJH method. As mentioned above, the phases of TiO2 were modulated by adjusting the contents of HCl and H2SO4 additives. The two anions could affect the behaviors of F127 (template agent) in the precursor solution, thus resulted in small deviation among the specific surface area of the MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, MesoTiO2–SiO2-A, and MesoTiO2–SiO2-M supports. TEM images display a perfect replication of hexagonal ordered pore structure and the uniform pore diameter for MesoTiO2–SiO2-M support (Fig. 3 a). The pore size was around 8nm, which was a little larger than the value calculated from the N2 adsorption measurement. As described in previous literatures, the TiO2 component can be finely dispersed in the mesoporous frameworks of TiO2–SiO2 composites through the assistance of TiOSi bonds [43]. The thoroughly removal of residue precursors by Soxhlet extraction facilitated the following impregnation, and then allowed the Pt NPs to be dispersed uniformly into the channels of the supports. Fig. 3(b–f) present representative TME images of MesoTiO2–SiO2-M support, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-A, and Pt/TiO2 (P25), respectively. The ordered porous structures of the catalysts were observed clearly in the TEM images of Fig. 3(a, b, e) taken along the channels. Fig. 3(c and d) display the TEM images of Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M taken along a normal direction. Pt NPs were confined in the meosporous frameworks with a fine dispersion, as observed from all the catalysts with TiO2–SiO2 supports in Fig. 3(b–e). The average Pt sizes in the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-A, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-R was about 5.9, 5.2 and 6.2nm, respectively. However, the Pt size in Pt/TiO2 (P25) was much smaller; its average diameter was around 2.5nm, as seen in Fig. 3f. It seems that these Si-containing mesoporous supports caused rapid growth of Pt nuclei during the reduction of catalysts and produced larger Pt NPs, although they had bigger surface area than TiO2 (P25). The exact Ti/Si ratios of the catalysts were identified by EDS (Fig. S1–3), and the values for the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-A, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M were all around 3:7, which was slightly lower than the precursor ratios because of incomplete hydrolysis of Ti precursors."
8,Catalytic performance and SMSI,"3.2 Catalytic performance and SMSI Generally, the selective hydrogenation of CAL may produce cinnamyl alcohol (COL) via CO hydrogenation; hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL) via CC hydrogenation; and hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL) via both CC and CO hydrogenation as shown in Scheme 1 . The influence of reaction conditions (including reaction time, temperature, pressure of H2) solvents, sizes of metal catalysts on the product distribution had been extensively studied, and several useful hypothesis to describe the reaction pathway were proposed for the CAL hydrogenation. However, influences of SMSI and defect sites of support on catalytic performance are not very clear yet. The catalytic performances of the as-prepared Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-A catalysts with different TiO2 phases were examined and compared with both the Pt/TiO2 (P25) and Pt/MesoSiO2 catalysts in term of activity and selectivity, the results are listed in Table 1 . Clearly, the catalysts with MesoTiO2–SiO2 supports showed superior catalytic performances to those with a single component support. It is known that the selectivity to COL deceases slightly along the increasing of conversion rate, because further hydrogenation of COL to HCOL would take place simultaneously. Therefore a high selectivity to COL at near complete conversion of CAL is very meaningful. It is noteworthy that the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M catalyst shows a high selectivity of 90.9% to COL at conversion of 98.8%, which is comparable to the excellent catalysts in the literature [17,25]. In contrast, the selectivity to COL over Pt/TiO2 (P25) at similar conversion or Pt/MesoSiO2 catalysts (at lower conversion of 31%) was only around 40%, it was much lower than the value over the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts. Besides, the activity of the catalysts was also affected greatly by the support. At the similar conversion of CAL (around 98%), the average reaction rate over Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-A, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-R, and Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M (3.9∗10−3, 1.3∗10−2, 3.9∗10−2 molg−1 h−1) were higher than that (3.6∗10−3 molg−1 h−1) of Pt/TiO2 (P25). While for Pt/MesoSiO2, the reaction rate was quite slow, only 31% conversion was achieved at reaction time of 7h. In particular, the reaction rate of Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M was almost 10times that of Pt/TiO2 (P25), although the later had much smaller Pt particles. Therefore, it was speculated that the metal particle size was a less influential factor compared with the composition and structure of the supports for the present reaction, and the metal-support interaction might play an important role in accelerating the reaction rate and promoting the product selectivity. Consequently, the metal-support interaction was studied using XPS characterization, and the chemical states of Pt and Ti in the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts were investigated in detail. Contrast to Pt/TiO2 (P25), the Ti 2p spectra shifted obviously to higher binding energy direction for all the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts, and the shift of Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M was most prominent (Fig. 4 ). Accordingly, the Pt 4f spectra shifted to lower binding energy value for all the three Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts by contrast with the Pt/TiO2 (P25). It was clearly that stronger interactions existed between MesoTiO2–SiO2 and Pt metal particles (SMSI) [42,44,45], in which the electron transferred from the surface of TiO2–SiO2 to the Pt particles. Evidently, the presence of silica facilitated the formation of SMSI, and it became much stronger with the existence of the mix-phase TiO2. It is speculated that the SMSI in this work could include both electron transfer and the formation of Pt-TiO x . Commonly, electrons can transfer from the reducible support to the metal, result in enrichment of electrons on the metal surfaces. Such charge transfer is quite complicated, which might be ascribed to the ensemble of Ti defects, oxygen vacancies and intermetallic bonds, etc. [2,45–47]. Generally, the local increase of electron density on Pt in similar system was considered as the source of SMSI’s enhancement of catalytic activity. The electron enrichments on the Pt surface may activate the electronphilic CO group by enhancing its adsorption, resulting in the higher activity and selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols. It is also assumed that Pt-TiO x system was firstly formed in the interfacial area and then followed by the partial migration of Ti and Pt species, where the encapsulation of Ti species by Pt NPs or the diffusion of Pt into the TiO2 lattice could take place during the reduction process. Noteworthy is the fact that the peaks of Ti2+ were present in all the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts. Indeed, the Ti3+ and Ti2+ can be produced under reduction atmosphere, especially the TiO2 size is small [48–50]. In addition, the presence of silica in the form of TiOSi and SiOSi bonds might facilitate the Ti2+ defects [44]. As displayed in the fitted XPS spectra in Fig. 5 , the examined four catalysts showed quite different Ti2+ content, and the maximum Ti2+ content achieved in the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M. Oppositely, Ti2+ species were not detected for the Pt/TiO2 (P25), indicating silica contributed to the Ti2+ formation. Clearly, the formation of Pt-TiO x (in which the dominated Ti species was Ti2+) was primarily caused by the introduction of silica, and it was further promoted by the mix-phased TiO2. The migration of Pt-TiO x system hence provided special active sites on the Pt surfaces or near the interfacial area, which can activate the CO bonds via the Ti2+ [51]. Therefore, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M showed the highest activity due to the electron enriched Pt and the highest Ti2+ content."
9,Proposed adsorption mode,"3.3 Proposed adsorption mode There is a consensus that the product selectivity in the CAL hydrogenation is mainly determined by the substrate adsorption modes, and which depends on the sort of metal, particle size, electronic state, steric hindrance of capping agent, and so on. A higher selectivity to COL was more likely achieved over a relatively larger particle [30,31]. Herein, the higher selectivity to COL (70–90%) was achieved over the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts with average Pt NP sizes of 5–6nm, but only 43.7% selectivity to COL was obtained over the Pt/TiO2 catalyst with a smaller size of 2.5nm. However, in present work, except for the Pt NPs size, other factors like the electronic state of Pt and Ti2+ also affected the selectivity of COL greatly. Among the three Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-R had the biggest Pt NPs sizes, but it didn’t show the highest selectivity. Besides, the reference catalysts with similar Pt NP size either didn’t show such a high selectivity to COL [31,52]. Therefore, in addition to the Pt NPs sizes, SMSI and Ti2+ can also affect the adsorption behaviors of CAL. The SMSI in this work consisted of charge transfer from the support to metal and mass transport (the formation of Pt-TiO x system). As shown in Fig. 6 , for the hydrogenation reaction over Pt/TiO2 (P25), the CAL adsorbed randomly on the surface of the smaller Pt particles via both horizontal mode (through the CC groups) and vertical mode (through CO groups). Consequently, such random adsorption of CAL resulted in a poor yield of COL. However, the adsorption mode over the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts was essentially different, in which CAL preferred to adsorb vertically through the terminal CO groups anchored onto the electron-enriched Pt surface. Such an adsorption mode was further enhanced by the encapsulated Pt-TiO x , in which Ti2+ played a key role. As a result, the reaction rate and selectivity of COL over the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts were improved significantly, and the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M presented excellent performance as it possessed favorable Pt size, electron enriched surfaces, and largest amount of Ti2+."
10,Catalyst stability,"3.4 Catalyst stability The stability and reusability of the heterogeneous catalysts are very important from the view of industrial application, and they are strongly limited by the aggregation, loss, coke, and sintering of metal NPs. The Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M exhibited excellent stability owing to the rational porous networks, in which the moving-induced aggregation and loss of Pt species was greatly reduced by the confinement effects of the mesoporous supports. Besides, the rational ordered porous frameworks facilitates the rapid desorption of the organic components from the active sites, and then suppress the coke formation. As expected, Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M can keep the higher selectivity and activity during the five recycles (Fig. 7 ). In brief, the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M displayed excellent catalytic performance toward selective hydrogenation of CAL to COL, and it is expected to be found potential applications for the hydrogenation of other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2 catalysts were prepared and they presented excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of CAL to COL. The roles of SMSI and Ti2+ on the catalytic performances in the hydrogenation of CAL were revealed. Ti2+ species was formed in the catalysts with assistance of silica, and it played key roles on the formation of Pt-TiO x , SMSI, and the adsorption modes of CAL. The charge transfer induced electron-enriched Pt NPs, and the Pt-TiO x systems were favorable for the vertical adsorption of CAL (via CO groups). Moreover, the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M catalyst showed an excellent stability, high activity and selectivity in five cycles. The confinement effect of the mesoporous structures in the Pt/MesoTiO2–SiO2-M catalyst successfully suppressed the aggregation and loss of active species, and coke formation as reported in the ordinary heterogeneous catalysts, which could also enhance the transfer and desorption of the product, as well as assist the fine dispersion of metal NPs on the supports. We believe this work can provide useful knowledge for the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes hydrogenation, and for understanding the Ti2+ and Pt-TiO x system, as well as for rational design of stable heterogeneous catalysts."
