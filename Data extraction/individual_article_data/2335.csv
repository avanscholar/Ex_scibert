0,Introduction,"As a sustainable energy, hydrogen is a promising alternative renewable energy and is considered as a clean and environmentally friendly energy. When hydrogen is combusted with oxygen, water is obtained as a by-product [1]. Hydrogen has a high energy yield of 122kJ/g, which is 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuel [2]. Hydrogen production from biological processes can be divided into two types i.e. photo-fermentation by cyanobacteria, algae, photosynthetic and chemosynthetic–fermentative bacteria and dark fermentation by anaerobic bacteria [3]. Hydrogen production from the dark fermentation process has advantages over the photo-fermentation process which is a low operating cost because light is not required and the rate of hydrogen production is greater [4]. In Thailand, the generation of food waste is about 20,041 tons per day, which accounts for 50% of municipal solid waste [5]. Food waste consists mainly of starch, protein, and fat, with a small amount of cellulose and hemi-cellulose which are possible sources for bioenergy production [6]. Due to its high organic content and its easily hydrolyzable nature, food waste is a good candidate to be used as the substrate for producing hydrogen by dark fermentation. However, food waste may lack of a nitrogen source which is a nutrient essential for hydrogen production [7]. Therefore, a search for a nitrogen source to co-digest with food waste in order to achieve a maximum hydrogen production is needed. Recent research has been investigating the use of sludge as a substrate to produce or co-produce renewable energy i.e. hydrogen and methane by an anaerobic digestion process because of its high carbon and nitrogen content [8]. Approximately 160 tons of sludge is generated daily in Thailand [9]. Therefore, a utilization of sludge for production of hydrogen is one of the alternate approaches to reduce or get rid of this abundant amount of waste. Co-digestion of food waste and sludge to produce hydrogen has been reported and it was found that the addition of sludge to food waste supplied a more balanced carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio [10]. The efficiency of hydrogen production is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient, ferrous iron and substrate concentration [11]. Co-digestion of food waste and sludge to produce hydrogen may encounter the problem of the inoculums being outgrown by normal flora in food waste and sludge. Therefore, the inoculums concentration needs to be optimized. The C/N ratio is important in a biological process. Microbes require a proper nitrogen supplement for metabolism during fermentation [12]. A proper C/N ratio could enhance the bacterial productivity of hydrogen suggesting that nitrogen should be supplied at the optimal amount [13]. The pH is also one of the factors controlling anaerobic biological processes. A buffer is required to reduce the fluctuation of pH during hydrogen fermentation because a formation of hydrogen is always accompanied by volatile fatty acids (VFAs) or solvents. A failure in pH control from the imbalances of alkalinity, pH and VFAs concentration might result in an interruption in hydrogen production [13] and inhibit the growth of hydrogen producers [14]. Therefore, the addition of buffer at a suitable concentration to counteract a decrease in pH would remove this limitation. Another important environmental factor affecting hydrogen production is nutrients. Hydrogen producing bacteria need nutrients for cell biomass and metabolites production [13]. In addition, nutrient can increase microbial activity so that they can effectively convert soluble organic matters into hydrogen [15]. From the aforementioned reasons, it can be seen that in order to efficiently produce hydrogen there is a need to optimize these environmental factors. However, it is laborious and time consuming to perform the optimization by a conventional technique or known as “a one factor at a time” method [16]. A statistical experimental design response surface methodology (RSM) can eliminate this limitation [17]. It is not only a time saving method but also can minimize the error in determining the effects of parameters as well as be able to demonstrate the interactive effects among the tested variables [18]. In this study, RSM with central composite design (CCD) was used to study the effects of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition on hydrogen yield (HY) and specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR). CCD has the advantages in term of rotability and the ability to analyze all the quadratic and interaction effects [19]. In addition, CCD offers 5 level of factors (i.e. −α, −1, 0, 1, +α) which facilitating the findings of the optimal point wider than the other designs [19]. Statistical optimization design on bio-hydrogen production has recently been reported in literatures [20–24]. For instance, Saraphirom and Reungsang [11] studied the factors affecting bio-hydrogen production from sweet sorghum syrup by anaerobic mixed cultures using CCD. Lee et al. [21] investigated the effects of temperature, pH and starch concentration on fermentative hydrogen production from starch by mixed anaerobic microflora using RSM. Pan et al. [22] investigated process parameters on bio-hydrogen production from glucose by Clostridium sp. Fanp2 using Plackett–Burman design and Box–Behnken design. O-Thong et al. [24] investigated factors affecting hydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent (POME) under thermophilic condition using an RSM with CCD. Although many studies have been done on the effect of environmental factors on hydrogen production from various kinds of synthetic substrates and wastes but the information on the statistically optimization of environmental factors on bio-hydrogen production from a co-digestion of food waste and sludge by anaerobic mixed cultures are still lacking. Therefore, this research attempted to optimize C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition using the RSM with CCD in order to maximize an HY and the SHPR. The information obtained from this study could pave the way toward a scaling up of the hydrogen production process and/or a continuous hydrogen fermentation process from a co-digestion of food waste and sludge."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of feed stocks,"2.1 Preparation of feed stocks Food waste was collected from a cafeteria on the Khon Kaen University campus, Khon Kaen, Thailand. The waste was made up of rice, vegetables, fruits and meats. Bones were removed from the food waste before being mixed with tap water at the volumetric ratio of 1:3; it was then ground in a food blender. The pH of the resulting food waste slurry was 7.2. Chemical characteristics of the food waste are shown in Table 1 . The resulting food waste slurry was stored at −17°C and thawed in the refrigerator before being used. The sludge was taken from the dissolved air flotation tank of the wastewater treatment plant of a food company in the Northeastern part of Thailand. Dissolved air flotation tank is used as a pretreatment to remove the debris as well as sludge from the factory before the influent is sent to the wastewater treatment plant. The company produces 5000 tons/day of frozen meat products and 1600 tons/day of ready meals. The plant handles an average 6500m3 of wastewater daily and generates 70–80 tons of sludge per day. Chemical characteristics of the sludge are shown in Table 1. The collected sludge was stored at 4°C prior the usage."
3,Seed sludge and preparation of inoculums,"2.2 Seed sludge and preparation of inoculums Anaerobic seed sludge was obtained from the full-scale anaerobic digester of an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor, which belonged to a brewery company in the Northeastern part of Thailand. The UASB is used to produce methane from the wastewater of the beer production process. The collected sludge was pre-heated at 105°C for 3h in a drying oven (LDO-100E) in order to deactivate methanogens which are hydrogen consumers. The pH and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 6.8 and 7.4g/L, respectively. For inoculums preparation, pre-heated sludge was cultivated in food waste at 20g-COD/L supplemented with 0.5mL/L of Endo nutrient solution [25]. The culture was shaken at 150rpm for 36h at 30±2°C before being used as the inoculums in the batch experiment. After 36h, the seed sludge was centrifuged at 12,000rpm for 5min, then analyzed for biomass concentration (in terms of VSS) and used as inoculums at various concentrations according to the design. Endo nutrient solution used in the bio-hydrogen production experiment was slightly modified in which it did not contain NaHCO3. The composition of the Endo nutrient was as follows (all in mg/L): 5240 NH4HCO3, 125 K2HPO4, 100 MgCl2·6H2O, 15 MnSO4·6H2O, 25 FeSO4·7H2O, 5 CuSO4·5H2O, and 0.125 CoCl2·5H2O. NH4HCO3 in the Endo nutrient solution was used as the initial alkalinity."
4,Bio-hydrogen production,"2.3 Bio-hydrogen production Bio-hydrogen production experiment was conducted in 120mL serum bottles with a working volume of 70mL. The fermentation broth contained different C/N ratio and concentrations of variables according to the design. Total COD and total N were used to represent the amount of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. In order to obtain substrate ingredients, food waste and sludge were mixed at various ratio so that the final C/N ratio were 10:1, 20:1, 30:1, 40:1 and 50:1. The serum bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen in the headspace of the bottles in order to create the required anaerobic condition and capped with rubber stoppers. The bottles were incubated at room temperature (30±2°C) and operated in an orbital shaker with a rotation speed of 150rpm. At designed time, the total gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using wetted glass syringe [26] and then analyzed for gas content by gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Effluent was collected by using a glass syringe and analyzed for VFAs and alcohol by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). All treatments were conducted in four replications. The hydrogen production was continued until the biogas volume could not be measured."
5,Experimental design and data analysis,"2.4 Experimental design and data analysis CCD was used to study the effects of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition on HY and SHPR. The experiments were designed by the Design Expert version 7.0® software, Stat-Ease Inc., MN, USA. The ranges and levels of independent input variables are shown in Table 2 . The HY and SHPR were selected as the dependent output variables. For statistical calculations, the test factors (Xi ) were coded as xi according to the following transformation equation (Eq. (1)): (1) x i = ( X i − X 0 ) / Δ X i , where xi is the coded value of the variable Xi , Xi is the actual value of the ith independent variable, X 0 is the actual value of Xi at the center point and ΔXi is the step change value. A quadratic model (Eq. (2)) [27] was used to evaluate the optimization of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition: (2) Y i = β 0 + ∑ β i x i + ∑ β i i x i 2 + ∑ β i j x i x j where Yi is the predicted responses, xi is the parameters, β 0 is a constant, βi is the linear coefficients, βii is the squared coefficients, and βij is the cross-product coefficients. The response variables (Y HY =the HY response and Y SHPR =the SHPR response) were fitted using a predictive polynomial quadratic equation (Eq. (2)) in order to correlate the response variables to the independent variables [28]. The Y HY and Y SHPR values were regressed with respect to C/N ratio (X 1), inoculums concentration (X 2), Na2HPO4 concentration (X 3) and Endo nutrient addition (X 4). Table 3 illustrates the coded values of the variables, the experimental design and the corresponding results."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Biogas composition was measured by a gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu) equipped with a TCD and a 2m stainless column packed with Unibeads C (60/80 mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the column oven and the detector were 150, 145 and 150°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25mL/min. For VFAs and alcohols analysis, the collected effluents were first centrifuged at 6000rpm for 10min then acidified by 0.2N oxalic acid and finally filtered through a 0.45m cellulose acetate membrane. The same GC model with an FID and a 30m×0.25mm×0.25m capillary column (Stabiwax) was used to analyze the VFAs and alcohols concentrations. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 250°C. The initial temperature of the column oven was 50°C for 2min; this was followed by a ramp of 15°C/min for 12.6min and then raised to a final temperature of 240°C for 1min. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 66mL/min. Concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphate, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, sodium, cobalt, VSS, and volatile solid (VS) were measured using the procedures described in standard methods [29]. Hydrogen gas production was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of hydrogen produced, at each time interval, using the mass balance equation (Eq. (3)) [30]: (3) V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H , 0 ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) where V H,i and V H,i−1 are the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i) and previous time interval (i −1), respectively; V G,i and V G,i−1 are total biogas volume at the current and previous time interval (i −1); C H,i and C H,i−1 are the fraction of hydrogen gas in the headspace at the current and previous time interval (i −1) and V H is the volume of the headspace of the serum bottles (50mL)."
7,Kinetic analysis,"2.6 Kinetic analysis The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (4)) was used to determine the cumulative hydrogen production [31]. (4) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative volume of hydrogen produced (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), λ is the lag-phase time (h), t is the incubation time (h), P is the hydrogen production potential (mL) and e is 2.718281828. Parameters (P, R m and λ) were estimated using the solver function in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 (Microsoft, Inc.) as explained by Khanal et al. [32]."

9,"The effects of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition on HY","3.1 The effects of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition on HY The effects of independent variables i.e., C/N ratio (X 1), inoculums concentration (X 2), Na2HPO4 concentration (X 3) and Endo nutrient addition (X 4) on HY obtained from the co-digestion of food waste and sludge were investigated. Regression analysis of the data from Table 3 resulted in the quadratic equation (Eq. (5)) as follows: (5) Y HY = 96.63 + 5.321 X 1 + 15.95 X 2 + 0.43 X 3 − 0.19 X 4 + 5.68 X 1 X 2 + 0.29 X 1 X 3 + 0.12 X 1 X 4 + 0.89 X 2 X 3 − 0.23 X 2 X 4 − 0.54 X 3 X 4 − 16.06 X 1 2 − 13.28 X 2 2 − 8.17 X 3 2 − 8.47 X 4 2 The ANOVA of the model (Table 4 ) indicated that the model significantly represents the experimental data (P <0.0001). A high determination coefficient (R 2) of 0.99 suggested that the model can explain 99% variability of the response variables. In addition, the lack of fit of the model was insignificant (P =1.0000). These results indicated that the effects of independent variables on HY in this study can be well described by the obtained models. The ANOVA of the model also showed that the quadratic model terms of all variables and the linear model terms of the C/N ratio and inoculums concentration are highly significant (P <0.0001). This indicates that these terms greatly affect the HY. Only the interaction model term of C/N ratio and inoculums concentration had impact on HY indicating by the P value less than 0.05. Based on the regression analysis of the model (Eq. (5)), the maximum HY of 102.63mLH2/g-VSadded could be predicted at the optimum conditions of 33.14C/N ratio, 2.70g-VSS/L inoculums concentration, 6.27g/L Na2HPO4 concentration and 7.51mL/L Endo nutrient addition. The response surface plots based on Eq. (5), with two variables kept constant at their optimum values and variations of the other two variables within the experimental range, are depicted in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1a–f is plotted with Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition, inoculums concentration and Endo nutrient addition, inoculums concentration and Na2HPO4 concentration, C/N ratio and Endo nutrient addition, C/N ratio and Na2HPO4 concentration and C/N ratio and inoculums concentration, respectively, being kept constant. Each response surface plot has a clear peak which suggested that the optimum condition fell well inside the design boundary (Fig. 1). HY significantly increased with the increase in the C/N ratio from 20 to 33.14 and then HY decreased when the C/N ratio was greater than 33.14 (Fig. 1a–c). The C/N ratio is important in the biological processes by affecting hydrogen fermentation efficiency. A suitable C/N ratio could enhance microbial growth and substrate utilization, thus improving the hydrogen production efficiency [33]. It is normally found that microorganisms utilize carbon 25–30 times faster than nitrogen. To meet this requirement, a C/N ratio of 20–30:1 is needed [12]. Our results showed a similar trend in which the optimum C/N ratio was 33.14. The optimum C/N ratio varied depending on types of substrate and microorganism used. A C/N ratio of 74 was optimum for thermophillic hydrogen production from POME by acclimatized Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge [24] while the hydrogen production from sucrose by anaerobic mixed cultures was optimized at the C/N ratio of 47 [34]. Without a nitrogen source, hydrogen could not be produced by Clostridium butyricum [12]. Under an excess of N source (low C/N ratio) condition, the substrate was mostly used for cell growth resulting in a low HY. In contrast, the excess of C/N ratio could decrease hydrogen production efficiency because low nitrogen contents are deficient for cell growth [13]. The HY increased when the inoculums concentration increased from 1.48 to 2.70g-VSS/L. However, a further increased in inoculums concentration to greater than 2.70g-VSS/L resulted in a decrease in HY (Fig. 1a, d and e). Using an inadequate inoculums concentration, the hydrogen producers in the seed inoculums might not be capable of competing with indigenous microflora in the substrate. The indigenous microflora might become dominant and produce the products that do not relate to hydrogen production or that might inhibit the hydrogen producers thus reducing the HY. In addition, the increase in inoculums concentration to a concentration greater than the optimum value might cause a rapid drop of pH in the fermentation broth. This would make the microorganisms more favorable for solvent production (second growth phase) and stop the first metabolites production (acids and gases) [35]. Therefore, the inoculums concentration should be compatible with the available substrate for maximizing bacterial activity. The effects of the Na2HPO4 concentration on HY were not significant (P =0.4377) (Table 4). The HY increased when Na2HPO4 concentration increased from 4.00 to 6.27g/L indicating a positive effect of Na2HPO4 concentration on HY (Fig. 1b, d and f). Na2HPO4 could improve the hydrogen production due to its buffering capacity because it can reduce the pH fluctuation caused by VFAs accumulated in the fermentation broth, thus enhancing the hydrogen generation and acidogenesis in the first stage of an acid-gas digestion system [36,37]. In addition, the P element in Na2HPO4 is essential for the synthesis of many molecular substances such as DNA, RNA and ATP [38]. A further increase in Na2HPO4 concentration to greater than 6.27g/L resulted in a decrease in HY which may be due to an increase in cytoplasmic osmotic pressure that occurs at high Na2HPO4 concentration [39]. An increase in Endo nutrient addition from 5.00 to 7.51mL/L slightly increased the HY (Fig. 1c, e and f). Endo nutrient contains elements that are essential for cell synthesis and microbial growth such as Fe, Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+. Iron is the most important hydrogen production related trace element because it forms ferredoxin and hydrogenase, which directly relate to the hydrogen production process [36]. Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+ are known as the enzyme cofactor [37]. NH4HCO3 in the Endo nutrient can prevent the fluctuation of the pH during hydrogen fermentation [40]. However, the results indicate that HY was decreased when the Endo nutrient addition was greater than 7.51mL/L. This may be due to the dissolution of bicarbonate in NH4HCO3 could increase CO2 in the system which therefore decreases the hydrogen content in the gas phase. In addition, the high ammonium concentration can cause adverse effect on microorganisms [15]. Moreover, Fe and Cu at high concentrations could inhibit and reduce the activity of hydrogen producers [41,42]."
10,"The effects of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition on SHPR","3.2 The effects of C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition on SHPR Effects of C/N ratio (X 1), inoculums concentration (X 2), Na2HPO4 concentration (X 3) and Endo nutrient addition (X 4) on SHPR (Y SHPR) during the co-digestion of food waste and sludge were examined. The observed and predicted values of SHPR are presented in Table 3. Multiple regression analysis was applied on the data in Table 3 and the obtained second-order polynomial equation (Eq. (6)) could well explain the SHPR. (6) Y SHPR = 55.97 + 4.55 X 1 + 8.32 X 2 + 3.06 X 3 + 0.39 X 4 + 3.26 X 1 X 2 − 2.05 X 1 X 3 + 1.04 X 1 X 4 + 1.36 X 2 X 3 − 0.52 X 2 X 4 − 0.24 X 3 X 4 − 9.28 X 1 2 − 7.59 X 2 2 − 9.86 X 3 2 − 5.57 X 4 2 It is evident from ANOVA (Table 4) that the quadratic regression model of Y SHPR was highly significant with a low probability (P <0.0001) and fit the experimental data well with the R 2 value of 0.95 accompanied by an insignificant lack of fit model (P =0.0962). The 3 variables i.e., C/N ratio, inoculums concentration and Na2HPO4 concentration were significant effect on SHPR (P <0.05) whereas Endo nutrient addition had insignificant effect on SHPR (P =0.7211). Results demonstrated that the only significant interaction effect on SHPR was found between C/N ratio and inoculums concentration (P =0.0259). The analysis of Eq. (6) provided the optimum conditions for SHPR: a C/N ratio of 33.14, an inoculums concentration of 2.70g-VSS/L, a Na2HPO4 concentration of 6.27g/L and an Endo nutrient addition of 7.51mL/L. The maximum SHPR of 59.62mLH2/g-VSSh was obtained under these optimum conditions. The response surface plots base on Eq. (6) with two variables being kept constant at their optimum values and variations of the other 2 variables within the experimental range are depicted in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a–f is plotted with Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition, inoculums concentration and Endo nutrient addition, inoculums concentration and Na2HPO4 concentration, C/N ratio and Endo nutrient addition, C/N ratio and Na2HPO4 concentration and C/N ratio and inoculums concentration, respectively, being kept constant. Results indicated a clear peak for each response surface plot (Fig. 2) which suggested that the optimum condition fell well inside the design boundary. Fig. 2a–c revealed that the SHPR increased significantly with an increase in the C/N ratio from 20 to 33.14. Conversely, the SHPR decreased with the further increase of C/N ratio to over 33.14. The SHPR increased when the inoculums concentration was increased from 1.48 to 2.70g-VSS/L and then decreased slightly following a further increase in inoculums concentration (Fig. 2a, d and e). An increase in Na2HPO4 concentration from 4.00 to 6.27g/L resulted in an increase in the SHPR to the maximum value. The SHPR decreased when the Na2HPO4 concentration was greater than 6.27g/L (Fig. 2b, d and f). Results showed in Fig. 2c, e and f indicated that the SHPR increased when the Endo nutrient addition was increased from 5.00 to 7.51mL/L. A further increase in Endo nutrient addition to greater than 7.51mL/L resulted in a decrease of the SHPR."
11,Optimization and confirmation of the experiments,"3.3 Optimization and confirmation of the experiments The analysis of Y HY (Eq. (5)) and Y SHPR (Eq. (6)) models indicated that in order to simultaneously obtain the maximum HY and SHPR, the C/N ratio, inoculums concentration, Na2HPO4 concentration and Endo nutrient addition should be optimized at 33.14, 2.70g-VSS/L, 6.27g/L and 7.51mL/L, respectively (Table 5 ). Under these optimal conditions, the model predicted an HY of 102.63mLH2/g-VSadded and an SHPR of 59.62mLH2/g-VSSh In order to confirm the validity of the statistical experimental strategy, three replications of batch experiments were conducted under optimal, medium (runs 4, 9, 11, 17, 18, 28), high (run 5) and worst (run 14) conditions (Table 5). The results of the confirmation experiments are in close agreement with the predicted values of HY and an SHPR. An HY of 101.14mLH2/g-VSadded and SHPR of 59.43mLH2/g-VSSh were obtained at the optimum condition. These results ensured that the obtained models are satisfactory and accurate. The change in the HY and the development of hydrogen during the fermentation process in the confirmation experiment at the optimum condition are depicted in Fig. 3 . The biogas produced in this study mainly comprised of hydrogen and carbon dioxide without methane (data not shown). The short lag phase of 2.4h of hydrogen production was observed. A sharply increase in hydrogen production was observed from 2.4 to 48h after which the hydrogen production increase gradually (Fig. 3a). At the end of fermentation, the main SMPs were butyric acid (61.1%) and acetic acid (28.8%). A small amount of ethanol (5.0%) propionic acid (4.0%) and formic acid (1.1%) was also detected (Table 5). The detection of butyric and acetic acids is a good indicator that efficient hydrogen production was achieved [43]. Theoretically, 4 moles of hydrogen are produced from glucose concomitantly with 2 moles of acetate, while 2 moles of hydrogen are produced when butyrate is the main metabolite [44]. The presence of a greater amount of butyrate than acetate in this study indicated that the hydrogen fermentation was butyrate type fermentation. Low amounts of ethanol and propionic acid coincided with the high HY obtained. The results at the optimum condition in this study were compared to the results from the literature search of using food waste and sludge as substrate for hydrogen production (Table 6 ). The HY obtained in this study was greater than that obtained in the study of Shin et al. [45]. However, our HY was lower than in the study of Ming et al. [10] and Zhu et al. [8]. The differences might be a result of the composition of food waste, sludge as well as the type of seed inoculums."
12,Conclusions,"This study successfully used food waste to co-digest with sludge for a production of hydrogen. The optimum conditions for hydrogen production from the co-digestion of food waste to sludge were C/N ratio of 33.14, inoculums concentration of 2.70g-VSS/L, Na2HPO4 concentration of 6.27g/L and Endo nutrient addition of 7.51mL/L. Under the optimum conditions, the predicted HY and SHPR were 102.63mLH2/g-VSadded and 59.62mLH2/g-VSSh, respectively. These values were relatively close to the experimental values of 101.14mLH2/g-VSadded and 59.43mLH2/g-VSSh. The HY and SHPR obtained from the experiments were only 1.01% and 1.00%, respectively, away from the predicted value."
