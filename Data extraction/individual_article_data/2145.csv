0,Introduction,"The discovery and development of non-toxic and vigorous solid heterogeneous catalysts with negligible or no adverse impact on the environment is the main concern of sustainable and green chemistry. Hence, claimed catalyst is expected to be environmentally benign with the aptitude of scale-up production in as little time as possible by allowing the reaction at a possible lower temperature. With increasing environmental consciousness, the search for alternative solids has come to an end with the attention of carbon-based material as desirable solid support. After the flourishing isolation of solo sheets of graphene in 2004, graphene has received tremendous deliberation in numerous areas owing to its fascinating electrical, optical and electrochemical properties [1–3]. In addition to this, its exceptional specific surface area, astonishing thermal and mechanical properties, manipulative functional groups indiscriminately arranged onto the surface [4–6] along with alluring stability towards varying acidic and basic conditions has been noticed to be impressive support in heterogeneous catalysis. Benzaldehyde (BzH) is the most crucial intermediate achieved by catalytic dehydrogenation of BzA, used for the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, dyes, plastic additives, fragrances flavouring additives and used as a bee repellent [7–12]. However, if pristine GO is used for this selective oxidation of BzA, the liberating hydrogen atoms from the organic molecules convert the epoxy groups embellishing the basal plane of GO to the diol groups by ring-opening [13]. This progression of development of diol on the surface of GO increases the C:O ratio which considerably hampers the oxidation reaction and decreases the yield due to significant diminution in the number of catalytically active sites in the vicinity of reaction [14]. Therefore, appropriate technical modus operandi for the functionalization of this oxidative debris adjudicates the utility of the as-functionalized GO in a wide range of transformation viz. oxidation, reduction, hydration and hydrogenolysis reactions. It is widely adapted for the oxidation of various olefins [15], numerous alcohols [16,17] and sulphides [18]. However, it has also been assessed over a wide range of reduction reactions such as reduction of benzyl alcohol [19], hydrogenolysis of CO bonds [20], hydration of alkynes [21] and activation of CH bonds [22]. Surface oxidative functional groups such as -COOH groups provide the acidity and make the GO favourable for the oxidation reactions. Hence, the presence of these oxidative functional groups may be advantageous for oxidation reactions. It is possible and advisable to selectively modify the choice of the functional groups which increases its potentiality in a precise application, eg. amino-based moiety was used to modify the hydroxyl groups of GO [23–25]. Li et al. [26] have utilized 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to alter the surface -OH groups to produce GO supported heterogeneous catalysts followed by grafting of CM–Salen H2 metal complexes. On the other hand, APTMS was also employed by Q. Zhao and co-workers [27] to covalently modify the –OH groups of GO. This amino-functionalized GO sheet was then condensed with salicylaldehyde followed by grafting with copper complex-forming tetrahedral chelate structure [Cu(salen)-f-GO] and the catalytic competency of this catalyst was tested over the epoxidation of olefins. Kumar et al. [28] have prepared GO immobilized Cu(II) Schiff base complex (GO@AF-SB-Cu) and inspected over Chan-Lam coupling reaction of amines and phenylboronic acid. Gao et al. [29] investigated elemental lead and three kinds of flue gas (CO/CO2/NO) adsorptions on carbonaceous surfaces using B3PW91/6-31G(d)/SDD level calculating the bond lengths, bond population, Mulliken charge, and adsorption energy. Conversely, for the activation of –COOH groups of GO, various chlorinating agents are available viz. pivaloyl chloride, phthaloyl dichloride, oxalyl chloride and thionyl chloride [30–33]. However, being cheaper, easily vaporous at ambient temperature and an excess quantity can simply be removed by distillation, thionyl chloride (SOCl2) became the choice of chlorinating agent to activate the –COOH groups [8]. S. Niyogi and co-workers [34] have performed the functionalization of carboxylic acids by refluxing GO in SOCl2. This chloro- functionalized GO sheet was then refluxed with octadecylamine which yielded 20 wt% of oxidized graphite. Xu et al. [35] have also reacted GO with SOCl2 followed by TPP-NH2. The final product was subjected to nylon membrane filtration and re-suspension in THF to produce TPP-NHCO-SPFGraphene. Liu et al. [36] and Zhang et al. [37] employed SOCl2 to activate the carboxyl groups of GO to produce graphene nanohybrid with porphyrin and fullerene, respectively through mild coupling reaction of the carboxyl groups of GO with -NH2 group of porphyrin and –OH group of pyrrolidine fullerene. The presence of –COOH groups provide a necessitate acidity to the catalyst which was experienced in the catalytic conversion of BzA to BzH [37]. To substantiate this belief, herein this work, for the first time, we have selectively modified acidic –COOH debris of GO through SOCl2 (Cl-f-GO), followed by immobilization of Cu-salen complex yielding Cu-f-GO catalyst. It was also substantiated through first principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations along with various physicochemical techniques. The catalytic aptitude of the as-prepared catalyst was tested over selective oxidation of BzA using 30% H2O2 as an oxidant. After realizing the poor result of the catalyst, it was decided to analyse the reaction in presence of a precursor. Hence, a few drops of conc. sulphuric acid (H2SO4) were used as a precursor and made a hypothesis that carboxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst provide acidic sites being substantiated through these catalytic results and NH3-TPD analysis."

2,Preparation of catalysts,2.1 Preparation of catalysts The experimental procedures for all steps involved in the synthesis of Cu-f-GO are provided in S1.2–S1.6 in the Supplementary Information.
3,Computational methodology,"2.2 Computational methodology To precisely investigate the structural and electronic properties, binding mechanism of a chlorinating reagent SOCl2 over GO with different functional groups like -O-, -OH and -COOH, we have performed first principles-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All DFT calculations to find the potential site for SOCl2 were done in the Gaussian09 program package [38] using well-known hybrid functional namely Becke three parameters with Lee-Yang-Perdew correlation functionals (B3LYP) which is the mixture of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and DFT exchange-correlation functional [38–40]. The 6-31G basis set along with (d, p) polarization functions was utilized. The molecular orbitals (MO), highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) were viewed through GaussView (version 5) using the outcomes of DFT calculations [41]. Furthermore, we have re-optimized all calculations to achieve the same theoretical level of accuracy. The adsorption energy (Ead) of SOCl2 over O-Graphene, OH-Graphene and COOH- Graphene is calculated through the following equation: (1) B E = E S O C l 2 + ( O / O H / C O O H − G r a p h e n e ) − ( E S O C l 2 + E ( O / O H / C O O H − G r a p h e n e ) ) where E S O C l 2 + ( O / O H / C O O H − G r a p h e n e ) is the optimized total energy of the system in which SOCl2 is adsorbed over -O-, -OH- and -COOH- functionalized graphene, respectively, E S O C l 2 is the optimized energy of SOCl2, E ( O / O H / C O O H − G r a p h e n e ) is the optimized energy of –O-, -OH- and –COOH- functionalized graphene. Through the definition, the negative value of E a d depicts an exothermic reaction. Furthermore, to study the chemical reactivity of SOCl2 on -O-, -OH- and -COOH- functionalized graphene, we have also calculated the global descriptors. Based on Koopman's theorem [42], the different global reactivity descriptors, i.e., electronegativity (χ), chemical potential (μ), global hardness (η), global softness (S), global electrophilicity index (ω), and the maximum electronic charge ∆Nmax that the system (electrophile) acquire from the environment were calculated using frontier molecular orbitals energies, ELUMO, EHOMO and are given by through below equations [43–46]; (2) χ = − 1 2 ( ε H O M O + ε L U M O ) (3) μ = − χ = 1 2 ( ε H O M O + ε L U M O ) (4) η = 1 2 ( ε L U M O − ε H O M O (5) S = 1 2 η (6) ω = μ 2 2 η (7) Δ N m a x = − μ η"
4,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra of GO, Cl-f-GO, salen, Cu-salen and Cu-f-GO. FTIR spectrum of GO exhibited characteristic peaks at 3389, 1722, 1623 and 1057 cm−1 which was ascribed to stretching vibrations of –OH, –CO, skeletal vibrations of the un-oxidized graphitic domain and COC groups, respectively[47–49]. Successful grafting of SOCl2 was authenticated by arising a new peak at 785 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of Cl-f-GO. Besides this, the peak at 1623 cm−1 was shifted to 1642 cm−1 which confirms the formation of –COCl group [49,50]. Moreover, the intensity of –OH groups at 3389 cm−1 was found to be decreased as a result of the substitution of some of the –OH groups by SOCl2. Theoretical results also support this fact based on the result of adsorption energy of SOCl2 with –OH and –COOH groups which were found to be analogous. However, the peak at 460 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra of the neat Cu-salen complex was attributed to the metal-oxygen bond. However, peaks arisen in between 1020 and 1280 cm−1 was might be due to the presence of aliphatic N; whereas, a strong peak at 1635 cm−1 was originated from νCN vibrations [51–54]. Peaks observed in the range of 1450 to 1581 cm−1 were attributed to the C=C absorptions [52,53]. Conversely, peak at 3500 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of salen ligand was seen to be declining in the FTIR spectra of Cu-salen complex, indicating the participation of phenolic oxygen in metal coordination [54,55]. In addition to this, bands found at 622 and 568 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra of Cu-salen complex were due to coordination of the Cu ion with phenolic oxygen (Cu-O) and azomethine nitrogen (Cu-N), respectively [54]. Furthermore, after the grafting of the Cu-salen complex onto Cl-f-GO, the CCl peak was disappeared suggesting successful grafting of Cu-salen complex. All the characteristic bands were visible in the FTIR spectra of catalysts with more or less intensity indicating little change in the morphology of the sample and these results are in good agreement with XRD and HRTEM analysis. It is well known that GO layers are also linked on the edges [56–59] and the rupturing of edges resulted in well-packed stacked layers [54]. These data are in good harmony with XRD results in which after functionalization with SOCl2, inter-planar distance seen to be decreased suggesting a well-packed stacked arrangement of GO sheets. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses of as-prepared samples viz. GO, Cl-f-GO, salen, Cu-salen and Cu-f-GO are represented in Fig. 2 . GO demonstrates a characteristic three steps degradation model. The first mass loss of 13% was noticed in the temperature range of 30 to 150 °C which was due to trapped water molecules. However, a 50% mass loss of the whole mass was examined at 410 °C. In the third stage, the remaining mass loss of residual carbon skeleton was experienced at 600 °C. TG pattern for Cl-f-GO observed was analogous to that of GO but deviating in the degradation of mass loss. The first mass loss experienced was 10.4% less than noticed in GO, while 50% mass loss in Cl-f-GO was inspected at 232 °C exhibiting a successful larger degree of functionalization. Poor physical and chemical stability of –COCl groups with the inability to form H-bond was might be the probable reason for this early weight loss. In addition to this, a lesser amount of oxidative debris onto the surface of Cl-f-GO than that of GO was another probable reason for such early weight loss. Moreover, in the TG curve of Cu-f-GO, 50% mass loss was observed at 370 °C signifying a high degree of successful grafting of Cu-salen complex onto the Cl-f-GO nanosheet. The third stage of mass loss was believed to be due to the carbon skeleton. Total mass loss of these three stages in Cu-f-GO is calculated to be 76.91% and the remaining mass loss of 23.08% is considered to be of non-degraded metal oxide as either CuO and/or Cu2O. Raman spectra of GO, Cl-f-GO and Cu-f-GO are illustrated in Fig. 3 . In the Raman spectrum of GO, two bands were found at 1364 and 1578 cm−1 assigned to out-of-plane vibrations of the graphitic ring due to the occurrence of defects and in-plane vibrations of E2g phonon of sp 2 bonded carbon atoms in rings and chains [60], respectively. The calculation of the D/G ratio is typically related to the degree of defects in the graphitic domain. Here, the ID/IG ratio for GO was found to be 0.84, however, in Cl-f-GO, it was increased to 1.04. This raise in defect pointed towards the development of sp3 carbon indicative of successful functionalization with SOCl2. In the Raman spectrum of Cu-f-GO, the intensity of the D and G bands was found to be decreased in comparison to Cl-f-GO due to a reduction in defects (sp2 carbon). This result suggests the substitution of some of the –OH groups by SOCl2 which is in good accordance with FTIR and XRD results by illustrating a notable fall in the intensity of –OH groups and by lessening the inter-planar distance, respectively. Moreover, the ID/IG ratio in Cu-f-GO was seen to be 0.99 is an indication of the polycrystalline nature of the sample. These data are in harmony with XRD and HRTEM analysis. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of GO, Cl-f-GO, salen, Cu-salen and Cu-f-GO. In the XRD pattern of GO, a characteristic peak at 2θ = 11.2° was found together with the weakening of a distinctive peak of graphite at 2θ = 26.5° suggested a high degree of oxidation of graphite to GO by modified Hummers’ method [61]. As calculated inter-planar distance in GO was found higher (8.1 Å) than in graphite (3.36 Å) and this might be due to the insertion of oxidative debris onto the surface of GO [62]. In the XRD pattern of Cl-f-GO, this characteristic peak of GO was disappeared and rise a new broad peak at 2θ = 25.01° with an inter-planar distance of 3.55 Å. This data validates the formation of –COCl groups by substituting hydroxyl groups of –COOH at the edges along with several –OH groups of basal plane. As a result of rupturing the edges, the formation of staked packing arrangement with a lower inter-planar distance of Cl-f-GO might affect on grafting and incorporation of the Cu-salen complex. Furthermore, in the XRD pattern of Cu-f-GO, peaks at around 29.8°, 36.8°, 42.7° and 61.8° corresponds to (110), (111), (200) and (220) planes of Cu2O [63], respectively. Besides this it also demonstrates minor peaks at around 35.7°, 39.9°, 47.8° and 60.9° which are indexed to (002), (111), (202) and (113) planes of CuO, respectively. This suggests the co-existence of Cu as Cu2O and CuO [64,65]. These data are analogous to JCPDS card no. 05-0667 along with JPCDS: 48-1548 for Cu-f-GO confirming the crystalline cubic phase of Cu2O. The bonding structure thus seen is in good agreement with XPS analysis. Conversely, on grafting with the Cu-salen complex, the amorphicity of the Cl-f-GO sheet was found to be decreased indicating the polycrystalline nature of the Cu-salen complex. A full range XPS survey spectrum divulges the chemical constitution of GO and Cu-f-GO (Fig. S1(A)). GO consists of C and O elements only showing characteristic signals at 285.9 and 533.1 eV, while after grafting with Cu-salen complex, the insertion of N and Cu is also substantiated in the XPS survey spectra of Cu-f-GO. Besides, high-resolution C1S spectra as shown in Fig. S1(B) revealed the bonding structure as CC, alkoxy CO, epoxy COC, and ester, as well as carboxyl C=O, observed at 284.5, 286.3, 288.2 and 289.2 eV, respectively in GO signifying successful oxidation of graphite by modified Hummers’ method. High-resolution C1S spectra of Cu-f-GO showed an alteration due to the incorporation of ligand (Fig. 5 ) as a decrease in the peak intensity at 286.3 eV and appearance of a new peak at 286.7 eV indicating covalent attachment of N of ligand to Cl-f-GO [66]. A magnified view of the N1S spectra of Cu-f-GO supports this covalent attachment by demonstrating peaks at 398.8 and 400.03 eV corresponding to non-graphitic N [66,67]. The high-resolution Cu2p XPS spectrum exhibited the “shake-up” satellites at 941.8 and 962.1 eV, validating the existence of Cu2+. Additionally, two characteristic peaks at 933.5 and 952.8 eV were ascribed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. This spin-orbit-coupled Cu2p region divulged the presence of Cu as Cu1+. These results revealed the existence of Cu as Cu2O and CuO which are in good agreement with XRD data. HRTEM images of GO, Cl-f-GO and Cu-f-GO catalysts with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns are provided in Fig. S2(A–M) in the Supplementary Information. GO possessed a two-dimensional 2–3 fold sheet-like layered structure (Fig. S2(A)). After functionalization with SOCl2, the thickness of GO at the edges was increased and on grafting with Cu-salen complex, a more layered structure with the well-stacked arrangement was analysed. A glimpse of HRTEM images of Cl-f-GO divulged that functionalization with SOCl2 increases the roughness of the surface demonstrating the development of defects which was in harmony with Raman analysis. In contrast to this, grafting of Cu-salen lessened the amorphicity of the sample suggesting the polycrystalline nature. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of GO (Fig. S2(D)) was confirmed the amorphous nature of the GO nanosheet [66]. Moreover, the SAED pattern of Cu-f-GO displayed poorly visible dots which signify the polycrystalline nature of the samples. The particle size calculated using Image J software for Cu-f-GO was 3.2 ± 0.05 nm. (Fig. S2(M)). With the results of ICP-OES analysis, the metal loading per gram of catalyst in the as-synthesized catalyst is estimated as 32.40 mg/g. Usually, the temperature-programmed desorption of the ammonia (NH3-TPD) method is a characteristic technique for the determination of the distribution of acid site strength on the surface of solid heterogeneous catalysts. Low-temperature peaks such as below 200 °C were assigned to mild acid sites, while the peak at an intermediate temperature range between 250 and 350 °C represents moderate acidic sites and the peak at high temperature ascribes to strong acid sites. Fig. 6 demonstrated the sorption profiles of NH3-TPD for the GO and Cl-f-GO. As can be seen from the figure that numerous peaks were obtained at diverse temperatures as a result of desorption of ammonia from the samples. In the sorption profile of GO, the peak exhibited at around 120 °C was seen to be shifted at around 102 °C in Cl-f-GO indicating the decrease in the adsorption of NH3. However, GO shows another peak at around 346 °C representing the second acidic site which was disappeared in Cl-f-GO. All these data confirm that the insertion of the -Cl group through the modification of carboxylic acid groups onto the GO surface resulted in the rise of weak acid sites and diminish the strong acid sites. The structural properties of SOCl2 adsorbed over –O–, –OH and –COOH functionalized graphene has been studied to gain the detailed arrangement of constituent atoms/molecules in the combined systems. Fig. S3 presents the top and side view of the initial structures of SOCl2 adsorbed –O–, –OH and –COOH functionalized graphene. The thionyl chloride molecule is placed parallel at a distance of 2 Å on all –O–, –OH and –COOH functionalized graphene. Furthermore, the SOCl2 was positioned over the functional groups of graphene to provide greater access and maximum effect. Fig. 7 shows the optimized structures of SOCl2 over –O–, –OH and –COOH functionalized graphene. In all cases, after the optimization, the SOCl2 molecule was reoriented with sulphur atom facing the functionalized graphene sheet depicting its affinity towards the structural defects. Our calculated structural properties were in good agreement with other calculations in the literature [68]. The equilibrium S-O bond distances are 2.87 Å and 6.39 Å in the case of O-Graphene as shown in Fig. 7(a). In OH-Graphene, the S-O bond distance reduces to 2.72 Å. However, in COOH-Graphene, the partial bond was formed between HCl with the bond distance of 2.42 Å, which was even smaller than the S-O bond distance in the other two systems (Fig. 7(c)). This alteration in structural parameters through binding will affect the electronic properties in all systems. The adsorption energy was determined through the formula given in Eq. (1). The lowest adsorption energy for SOCl2 was found for O-Graphene (−0.21 eV) presented in Table 1 . The adsorption energy for OH-Graphene and COOH-Graphene was almost similar to the values of −0.30 eV and −0.29 eV, respectively. The adsorption energy follows the sequence: OH-Graphene+SOCl2>COOH-Graphene+SOCl2>O-Graphene+SOCl2. Although the binding energies were almost similar in both OH-Graphene and COOH-Graphene, the partial bond distance between HCl (in COOH-Graphene) was much lower than S-O (in OH-Graphene) (Fig. 7(b and c)). This suggests that the -OH- group of a carboxyl group at the edges site prefers to bind or replace through chlorine of SOCl2 as compared to S-O bonding in the basal plane of OH-Graphene. Further, we have also calculated Raman spectra of pristine and COOH-Graphene+SOCl2 as SOCl2 presents superior binding over COOH-Graphene and is in agreement with our experimental study. The stability of COOH-Graphene+SOCl2 is also confirmed through the frequency calculation which shows the positive values of all acquired frequencies. The Raman spectra presented in Fig. 8 where COOH-Graphene+SOCl2 depicts the two most intense peaks at 1381 and 1624 cm−1 are assigned to D and G bands, respectively; whereas for pristine the peaks were at 1390 and 1624 cm−1. The D and G bands were due to edge defects of finite crystalline size and carbon-carbon bond stretching. The theoretical ID/IG ratios were observed to be 1.3 and 1.4 for COOH-Graphene and COOH-Graphene+SOCl2 respectively, confirming good agreement with our experimental results. To have an idea of chemical reactivity and site selectivity of SOCl2 over –O–, –OH and –COOH functionalized graphene, we have evaluated electronegativity (χ), global hardness (η) and softness (S) values, electrophilicity index (ω) and chemical potential (μ) using Koopman's theorem along with the maximum electronic charge (ΔNmax) acquired by the system from the environment proposed by Parr et al. and are presented in Table 2 . For a system to be good electrophile it should consist of high values of μ and ω, however, for nucleophile in nature low values of μ and ω are essential. As stated by the maximum hardness principle, the most stable structure comprises maximum hardness. Table 2 presents that interaction between SOCl2 and OH-Graphene results in high-value global hardness indicating their strong interaction. The electrophilicity index (ω) examines the stabilization energy when a certain system acquires an extra charge from the surrounding. The large value of ω in OH-Graphene+SOCl2 indicates its strong electrophile nature as compared to other systems. The chemical potential presents the trail of charge transfer functioning as an electrophile. Consequently, its μ must be negative. Our calculated μ is negative in all cases. Intending to provide enlightenment between structural and electronic properties, the contour plots of highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) were presented in Fig. 9 . The HOMO and LUMO depict the electronic nature of molecules and are important in defining their chemical stability [69]. The possibility to give out an electron was given by HOMO while the possibility to take an electron was provided through LUMO levels. The red colour presents positive and the green colour presents negative phases of SOCl2 over -O-, -OH- and -COOH- functionalized graphene. As seen in Fig. 9, in O-Graphene+SOCl2, the delocalized π-bonds were distributed all over for HOMO. However, SOCl2 weakens the uniformity of π-conjugated system and therefore we can see the characteristics of σ orbit. However, in the case of COOH-Graphene+SOCl2, the HOMO was spread almost on the entire sheet while LUMO resides only on the SOCl2 molecule. The energy gap was calculated through the equation, E g = E L U M O − E H O M O . After the adsorption of the SOCl2 molecule, the bandgap increases in OH-Graphene. However, for the other two O-Graphene and COOH-Graphene, the band gaps reduce. For the demonstration of the SOCl2 effect over –O–, –OH and –COOH functionalized graphene, we also plotted the density of states (DOS) as seen in Fig. 10 The plotted curves for the DOS are derived from the distribution of MO energy levels in the Multiwfn package [70]. The vertical lines depict the position of the HOMO level in considered systems. The DOS is plotted with the Gaussian width of 0.05 a.u. The change in the HOMO level is maximum for the OH-Graphene with SOCl2, of course not that significant in comparison to O-Graphene and COOH-Graphene with SOCl2. However, a noticeable change is observed for OH-Graphene+SOCl2 as it has low binding energies. In summary, our DFT calculation which was in good agreement with our experimental results showed that the chlorine of SOCl2 prefers to bind with the -OH- group of COOH-Graphene. We hypothesise that SOCl2 can activate the carboxyl groups only, however, based on the theoretical model (adsorption energy values), it can replace surface hydroxyl groups too along with carboxyl groups on the edges. This can also be substantiated by the FTIR analysis (discussed earlier) as the intensity of -OH groups was also decreased. Moreover, from the TG analysis, it can be confirmed as the thermal stability was also low in the choro-functionalized GO sheet. However, from Raman spectra, ID/IG ratio in Cl-f-GO was increased to 1.04. It is higher than –OH functionalized GO. In XRD, the peak around 2θ = 11.2° was not observed in functionalized GO confirming the replacement of –OH groups in GO. Based on such results, we made a hypothesis for the poor potency of the as-prepared catalyst and the same was obtained in Section 4 as a result of catalytic activity. Hence, we required an acidic precursor for getting a better result, as the acidic site on the catalyst was not sufficient for the desired result."
5,Catalytic activity,"The catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts was weighed up against the selective oxidation of BzA using 30% H2O2 as an environmentally benign oxidant in the presence of ethylene glycol as a product selective solvent. For any reaction to bringing to an end at the intermediary stage is rather difficult and for this rationale, various parameters have been optimized, for instance, the mole ratio of substrate to oxidant, temperature, amount of catalyst, solvent effect, solvent amount, oxidant and time. In a typical reaction condition, a catalyst was dispersed in a solvent and allowed to stir for 10 min. For complete activation of the substrate, it was added and stirred for 10 min. It was followed by the dropwise addition of oxidant and the final mixture was stirred for experimentally pre-decided time. For this transformation, 40 mmol BzA, 40 mmol 30% H2O2, 5 mL ethylene glycol and 50 mg of catalyst were fed to 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask and equilibrated at 90 °C for 3 h. The reaction progress was analysed with GC by ejecting aliquots at different time intervals. For practicability, we do not show the selectivity for the conversion of less than 8%. The results of this catalytic reaction have been summarized in Table S1. Almost no conversion was achieved with pristine graphite and Cl-f-GO. GO has also shown the same trend with a 3.44% conversion of BzA. However, the neat compound of the Cu-salen complex demonstrated a 6.17% conversion of BzA. Cu-f-GO exhibited a 3.6% conversion of BzA and 81.1% selectivity of BzH. This poor performance of the catalyst was might be due to less acidic sites which are an extremely life-sustaining factor for the catalyst particularly in the oxidation process. In our previous work [47], the presence of carboxylic acid debris on graphene oxide had increased the oxidation degree and had a prominent effect on the catalytic activity of BzA. An increase in oxygen content in GO improves its catalytic activity [71], which is attributed to the increase in the acidic nature of graphene oxide. Here, in this work, as we have modified –COOH groups of GO, acidic sites on the surface of catalyst lessen and this was also proven by ammonia TPD study. This modification of carboxyl groups lessened the acidic nature of the catalyst. In addition to modification of –COOH groups, some of the –OH groups of the basal plane might also be replaced via thionyl chloride which also affects the catalytic activity. This resulted in the use of an acidic precursor for a given catalytic reaction. Accordingly, we have decided to perform this reaction in the presence of a precursor. Thus a few drops of conc. H2SO4 were employed and as per our expectation conversion was a boost to 92.38% with 93.21% selectivity of BzH (Fig. S4). Hence, the impact of other parameters was inspected using a catalyst with the precursor. A solvent may also affect the conversion, selectivity, stability of the desired product and whole catalytic reaction [72]. This study aimed to assess the practicability of the solvent effect on the conversion of BzA and the selectivity of BzH. For this, diverse solvents like methanol, acetonitrile, N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, toluene, and ethylene glycol were scheduled and studied their effect on conversion and selectivity. As shown in Fig. S5, methanol, acetonitrile, and DMF gave very petite conversion of BzA 2.77, 3.66 and 3.88% conversion of BzA. However, toluene offered a 6.96% conversion of BzA. On the other hand, 1,4-dioxane exhibited 87.97% conversion of BzA with 98.76% BzH selectivity. To further increase conversion based on our experience ethylene glycol was studied for this transformation. As per expectation, it was proved to be a model solvent for this transformation by giving 92.38% conversion of BzA with 93.21% selectivity of BzH. As a result, ethylene glycol was chosen as the preferred solvent for this transformation. To determine the impact of varying mole ratios of a substrate i.e. Benzyl alcohol (BzA) to the oxidant, four different mole ratios viz. 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5 were analysed. As shown in Fig. 11 , it was noticed that H2O2 had played a crucial role in the degradation of benzyl alcohol; a low concentration of H2O2 to the substrate (1:1) gave a rather similar conversion of BzA (92.38% conversion & 93.21% selectivity). While the increased mole ratio of H2O2 (1:1.5) had resulted in 97.01% conversion of BZA, but the selectivity of BzH was decreased (21.28%). However, a further increase in the mole ratio of H2O2 (1:2) showed a further rise in the conversion of BzA (97.99%) with 25.33% BzH selectivity. On the other hand, the selectivity of other products was increased in both these cases. A higher concentration of H2O2 (1:2.5) was extended the conversion to 100% with 98.64% BzH selectivity. Hence, we have taken 1:2.5 as a preferred mole ratio to investigate the impact of other parameters. We have inspected four different amounts of catalyst i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 50 mg (Fig. 12 ). After obtaining the desired conversion of BzA with 50 mg of catalyst, 40 mg of catalyst was tested on this transformation and very poor conversion (16.02%) of BzA was observed with 59.08% selectivity of BzH. Further decrease in catalyst amount (20 mg) showed a further decrease in conversion (5.01%). The lowest conversion of BzA was achieved with 10 mg of catalyst amount i.e. 4.23%. With increasing the catalyst amount, the metal concentration and ultimately active sites were also increased and attain adequate for the potent catalytic activity. Therefore, 50 mg was taken as the preferred catalyst amount for further investigation of other parameters. We have executed this reaction at different time intervals, viz. 0.5, 1 and 2 h (Fig. S6). In 0.5 h, a 4.82% conversion of BzA was achieved. After the examination of the reaction mixture withdrawn at 1 h, it was observed that conversion increased to 100% with 98.64% selectivity of BzH. On further continuing the reaction for 2 h, no substantial change was observed. For this reason, we decided to set the reaction time for 1 h for further exploration of other parameters. The effect of four different reaction temperatures such as 70, 80, 90 and 100 °C on the oxidation of BzA is demonstrated in Supplementary information as Fig. S7. It is visible from the figure that 8.37% conversion of BzA is achieved at 70 °C. When the temperature rises to 80 °C, the conversion also increased to 15.65% with 90.75% BzH selectivity. Moreover, the maximum conversion of 100% of BzA is monitored together with 98.64% BzH selectivity at 90 °C. However, a further rise in the temperature (100 °C) has resulted in a decrease in conversion (5.08%). This decrease might be due to the bulk degradation of H2O2 at a higher temperature. Subsequently, 90 °C is chosen as a representative temperature. We have examined the reaction by varying the amount of solvent, for instance, 2, 5 and 10 mL. As shown in Fig. S8, only 4.83% conversion of BzA was obtained with 2 mL of solvent amount. If the amount of ethylene glycol was increased (5 mL), 100% BzA conversion was achieved with 98.64% BzH selectivity. On further rising in the amount of solvent (10 mL), striking changes in the conversion and selectivity were observed. A conversion of BzA was decreased to 93.15%, but the selectivity lessened dramatically to 52.34% while on the other hand selectivity of other products rose appreciably (47.66%). The explanation for this reduction was given by dilution of the reaction mixture to a great extent with 10 mL of the solvent amount. Accordingly, 5 mL was chosen as the preferred solvent amount for further optimization of reaction parameters. Different oxidants such as TBHP and 30% H2O2 on the oxidation of BzA (Fig. 13 ) were also examined. The data divulges that TBHP was proved to be sub-standard for this reaction with 16.02% conversion of BzA and 59.08% selectivity of BzH. In contrast to this, 30% H2O2 is fairly inexpensive, easy to handle, more efficient, and a greener oxidant as yielded only water as the by-product. Consequently, 30% H2O2 is chosen as a preferred oxidant for further catalytic investigation. Recyclability of as-prepared catalyst was performed by taking BzA as a model substrate with Cu-f-GO catalyst under the experimentally acquired optimized reaction conditions. The catalyst was recovered after each reaction by filtration and washed with solvent 3–4 times. It was followed by oven drying before employing for further catalytic tests. The reaction mixture of each catalytic experiment was analysed by GC. The results of the recyclability study are demonstrated in Supplementary information as Fig. S9. This catalyst was recycled 2 times and in the third recycles activity; conversion was decreased to 85.12%. This lower recyclability was the result of the leaching of the metal ion."
6,Conclusion,"There is a lot of ambiguity for the presence of oxidative debris on the GO surface and their role in providing acidic sites. Hence, to make sense, we have selectively modified the carboxylic acid groups of GO through SOCl2. This chloro‑functionalized GO nanosheet was then grafted with a Cu-salen complex to yield a heterogeneous catalyst (Cu-f-GO). DFT calculations were also performed to find the potential site for SOCl2 through its adsorption energy over all the oxidative functional groups presented on GO. In the present study, an impact of the presence and modification of acidic –COOH debris of GO and the number of corresponding acidic sites were explored through the catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol. The outcome of the catalytic activity suggests the mediocre performance of the as-synthesized catalyst. This inferior performance of the catalyst might be due to lesser acidic sites on the surface of the catalyst. As it was believed that –COOH debris provide the acid sites to the catalyst and in this work almost all the –COOH debris were modified, it resulted in fewer acidic sites on the surface of the catalyst. To support this hypothesis, we have analysed the GO and chloro‑modified (Cl-f-GO) GO through the NH3-TPD study. The results of this study are in good agreement with our assumption. GO possess more acid sites compared to Cl-f-GO. Hence, it can be concluded from the discussion so far that the presence of carboxylic acid debris on GO provides more acid sites that lead to higher catalytic proficiency."
