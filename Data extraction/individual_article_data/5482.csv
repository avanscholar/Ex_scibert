0,Introduction,"Esterification is one of the most important reactions in fundamental organic synthesis. The broad application of esters in fragrances [1], pharmaceuticals [2] and adhesives [3], as well as the concept of green chemistry, require the improvement of ester synthesis methods. In traditional methods [4], carboxylic acids or carboxylic derivatives were first obtained using the corresponding alcohols before being mixed with alcohols to prepare esters under reflux. Those processes are usually operated at higher temperatures, inevitably generating by-products [5]. To simplify the operation and improve efficiency, the catalytic one-pot oxidative esterification of alcohols and aldehydes was proposed [6,7] using I2 [8,9], KHSO5 [10], MnO2 [11,12] or H2O2 (33%) [13] as an oxidant. Later, the direct oxidative esterification of alcohols was achieved under O2. Su et al. [14] reported that alcohols or aldehydes could form homologous methyl esters with methanol at 90°C, 5atm O2 on Au/β-Ga2O3. The conversions and selectivities were high. Hao et al. [15] reported that benzyl alcohols and methanol could form methyl benzoate with Au/SBA-16 and K2CO3 at 25°C under 6atm of O2. PI–CB/Au–Pd [16], Au–Ag [17] and [PdCl2(CH3CN2)] [18] were applied as catalysts in many studies. These efficient protocols for aerobic oxidative esterification required higher temperatures or pressures; these conditions should be avoided for sustainable development in chemistry. Thus, the preparation of esters via direct oxidative esterification of alcohols using O2 at ambient temperature and pressure is attractive. In recent years, gold nanoparticles have been widely applied during the selective oxidation of alcohols [19–22], the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds [23] and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions [24]. Considering the interaction between the substrates and supports [25–27] as well as the oxygen molecular adsorption on 2–5nm gold nanoparticle [17,28], we decided to use gold nanoparticles supported on metal oxides as catalysts. In this investigation, we prepared gold nanoparticles supported on metal oxides (CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, HT and Al2O3) and tested their oxidative esterification activities of benzyl alcohol [29–31], using O2 as an oxidant at ambient temperature and pressure. We found that Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2 showed excellent catalytic efficiencies with good recyclabilities; they were suitable for the catalytic oxidative esterification of various alcohols and the self-oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol. More importantly, based on previous research achievements and the present experimental studies, a reaction mechanism was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Methanol, ethanol, hydrochloric acid, acetone, petroleum ether and DMSO were obtained from Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China, while CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2 (anatase), NaBH4, l-lysine and benzyl alcohol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. The hydrotalcite (Its shortening name is HT) was prepared by Jing Yu. Most alcohols, HAuCl4·3H2O, Cs2CO3, 1,4-dioxane, benzotrifluoride and mesitylene were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd."
3,Preparation of catalysts with 3 wt% gold [32],"2.2 Preparation of catalysts with 3 wt% gold [32] The gold nanoparticles were supported on a metal oxide powder (CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, HT and Al2O3). A quantity of metal oxide (2.5g) was weighed and dispersed in deionized water (50mL). To ensure a uniform dispersion, the suspension was stirred for 10min and ultrasonically dispersed for 10min. Then, HAuCl4 (100mL, 3.8×10−3 mol·L−1), l-lysine (20mL, 0.53mol·L−1) and NaBH4 (10mL, 0.35mol·L−1) were added sequentially to the above-mentioned suspension with a slow dripping speed and stirring. Afterward, dilute hydrochloric acid was added to adjust the pH value to approximately 9.5. The mixed solution was stirred for 1h and left standing for 24h to obtain a precipitate that could be used as a catalyst after being separated, washed and dried."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a FEI Tecnai F20 TEM at 200kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with an Empyrean diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 40mA (λ =1.5406Å). The gold content of the supports was determined using a GBC AVANTA XY-05 atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) from the Inner Mongolia Minerals Experiment Research Institute. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a Kratos XSAM800 with Al Kα radiation at the Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The conversions and selectivities of the alcohol reactions were calculated according to the results determined by Gas Chromatograph -2014C (GC-2014C). The speciation of the products was measured with a Trace DSQII gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) at Inner Mongolia University."
5,Activity test,"2.4 Activity test Known amounts of catalyst, base and alcohol (RCH2OH, 2mmol) were mixed with methanol in a round bottomed flask. The reaction device was sealed after having been filled with O2 at ambient pressure and then kept at a specified temperature with a magnetic stirrer. During the reaction, the O2 was supplemented; a small amount of the mixture was extracted and filtered to remove the catalysts. The filtrate was analyzed using the GC-2014C."
6,Results and discussion,
7,TEM,"3.1 TEM To reveal the size, shape and distribution of gold nanoparticles over catalysts, these samples were characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 1 , the following features of the catalysts were identified. (1) The gold particles were spherical and uniformly distributed on the CeO2 and ZrO2 (Fig. 1a and c). (2) Most gold particles were within 3–6nm for Au/CeO2 and 4–7nm for Au/ZrO2. (3) However, for the recycled catalysts, the number of gold particles was slightly reduced on the support surfaces (Fig. 1b and d). (4) Moreover, part of the gold particle sizes became slightly larger as a result of aggregation due to reuse. (5) The electron-diffraction pattern (Fig. 1e) showed that the gold existed in mono-crystalline form and that its lattice spacing was close to 0.238nm, corresponding to the Au(111) crystal plane."
8,XRD,"3.2 XRD The X-ray diffraction patterns of the supports and the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . Clearly, the structures of the supports remained nearly unchanged after gold loading and reuse, revealing that they were stable enough for practical applications. No gold diffraction peaks were detected due to the smaller particle sizes and lower gold contents [33–35]. The gold contents of the supports were assessed by AAS: they were 2.8% for Au/CeO2, 2.4% for recycled Au/CeO2, 2.9% for Au/ZrO2 and 2.1% for recycled Au/ZrO2. Some of the gold was lost from the catalysts after they were reused 10 times, as observed by TEM and AAS."
9,XPS,"3.3 XPS The surface composition and chemical states of the catalysts were investigated by XPS. The full-range XPS spectra (Fig. 3 a) clearly showed characteristic signals of O, Ce or Zr for the supports, as well as Au for the gold nanoparticles. The O signals could be attributed to CeO2 or ZrO2, as well as O2 and H2O adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces. For Au/CeO2, the signals of Ce 3d (Fig. 3b) were fitted to two sets of triplets (3d3/2 and 3d5/2): one set of binding energies (BEs) was 900.9, 907.1 and 916.5eV, while the other was 882.5, 888.3 and 898.1eV. The difference between the main signals was 18.4eV (900.9–882.5=18.4eV), similar to the standard values for CeO2 (18.3eV). The other signals, marked “S” in Fig. 3b, correspond to the satellite lines of CeO2 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. The two signals from Au/ZrO2 (Fig. 3c) were 184.3 and 181.9eV, respectively, corresponding to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Zr4+, respectively. The Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 BEs of Au/CeO2 were 87.4eV and 83.7eV, respectively, equaling the values of metallic gold [24,32] (Fig. 3d). Therefore, the supported gold nanoparticles existed in the metallic state. As shown in Fig. 3e, the Au 4f BEs of Au/CeO2 and the recycled Au/CeO2 (87.4 and 83.7eV) were similar to that of Au/ZrO2 and recycled Au/ZrO2 (87.2 and 83.5eV). Although the signals of the recycled samples were significantly decreased and jagged due to their lower gold contents, the gold nanoparticles remained consistently in the metallic state. Therefore, CeO2, ZrO2 and Au state are stable because their XPS spectra remained unchanged after 10 reuses (not shown here)."
10,Activity test,"3.4 Activity test 3.4.1 Activity test of benzyl alcohol and methanol To assess the activity of the catalyst, a primary study on the oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol (2mmol) and methanol (10mL) under the initial conditions (Au/CeO2 (50mg), Cs2CO3 (20mol%, 0.2606g), at 30°C, and filled with O2) was undertaken. The products were detected by GC; 98.3% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 99.7% selectivity of methyl benzoate were obtained after 3h. Encouraged by this excellent result, we optimized the reaction conditions: 5mL of methanol as a solvent, 10mol% of Cs2CO3 as a base [36], 25mg of catalyst and filled with O2 under ambient temperature and pressure. Benzyl alcohol and methanol were chosen as the model substrates, and the reactions were carried out under various conditions (Table 1 ). When the reaction was carried out without any catalyst, gold, base or dioxygen, almost no methyl benzoate formed (Table 1, entries 1, 2, 9 and 10). Therefore, these components were essential for the oxidative esterification reaction. The reaction on micron-size gold particles gave a lower conversion of benzyl alcohols and a moderate selectivity for methyl benzoate (Table 1, entry 3). Additionally, when comparing a set of catalysts, ideal catalytic activities were exhibited on Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2. Slightly lower catalytic activities were obtained on Au/TiO2 and Au/HT. However, even lower catalytic activities were detected on Au/Al2O3 (Table 1, entries 4–8). The gold nanoparticle sizes ranged from 3 to 6nm, 4 to 7nm, 5 to 7nm, 10 to 13nm and 5 to 7nm for Au/CeO2, Au/ZrO2, Au/TiO2, Au/HT and Au/Al2O3, respectively (Figs. 1 and S1). Therefore, the catalytic performance was determined not only by the size of the gold nanoparticles but also by the interaction of substrate and the support [17,28]. Generally, the smaller the size of gold nanoparticles is, the higher the reactivity of the catalyst is. Au/Al2O3 exhibited poor catalytic activity, because Al2O3 is easily damaged under alkaline conditions as an amphoteric oxide. The production of methyl benzoate declined in air due to the deficiency of dioxygen compared to that in pure oxygen (Table 1, entry 11). 3.4.2 The recyclability of catalysts Based on the excellent activities over Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2, further experiments were performed to test their recyclabilities. The test results are displayed in Fig. 4 . The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity of methyl benzoate reached 100% on Au/CeO2 after 4 cycles and on Au/ZrO2 after 5 cycles. After each cycle, the catalysts were washed with ethanol, centrifuged and dried at 60°C for the next cycle. When the catalysts were reused 10 times, their conversions were 94.0% and 92.0% on Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2, respectively. The selectivities were 100.0% and 88.4% on Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2, respectively. This slight decline was attributed to the shedding of some gold nanoparticles, as observed in the TEM images (Fig. 1b and d) and AAS data. In summary, their high conversions and selectivities reflect the recyclability of Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2. 3.4.3 Activity test of primary alcohols (or benzyl aldehyde) and methanol (or ethanol) To study the scope of this procedure, various primary alcohols and benzyl aldehyde were examined under optimized conditions. The experimental results are presented in Table 2 . The results were as follows: (1) when comparing benzyl aldehyde with benzyl alcohol, benzyl aldehyde reacted more easily than benzyl alcohol (Table 2, entries 1, 2). (2) Catalytic activities on Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2 were similar in methanol. The same trend was observed in ethanol. (3) For most alcohols (R1CH2OH), their reactions with methanol (at 25°C) were easier than that with ethanol (at 30°C) due to the stronger nucleophilicity of the methoxy group relative to the ethoxy group. (4) Substituted benzyl alcohols (Table 2, entries 2–5) exhibited excellent activities, especially when reacting with methanol (conversions >99.0%). Based on the results with ethanol, their substituent effects can be estimated to have the following conversion order: p-OCH3 >p-CH3 >p-H>p-Cl. This sequence shows that when the electron-donating ability of the substituent group is stronger, the reactivity is higher. Conversely, p-nitrobenzyl alcohol (Table 2, entry 6) exhibits a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than p-chlorobenzyl alcohol and exhibits a higher reactivity in ethanol. (5) Cinnamyl alcohol was also successfully applied to the oxidative esterification system (entry 7). The selectivities of methyl cinnamate on Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2 reached 94.9% and 97.1% in methanol but only 53.3% and 51.5% in ethanol, with high conversions. The major by-product in ethanol was cinnamyl aldehyde, which was also the intermediate used to form methyl cinnamate; this species was stable due to its conjugated structure. (6) Heterocyclic alcohols and aliphatic alcohols exhibited low reactivities (entries 9–11) due to the difficulty encountered during α-H elimination [37,38]. (7) Under these conditions, the oxidative esterification of 2-phenylethanol was difficult (entry 12). When the temperature was increased to 50°C, conversion reached only 7.9%, while the selectivity dropped to 78.1%. In addition, other methods were attempted to improve the conversion of 2-phenylethanol, such as the use of solvents with different polarities (petroleum ether, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, mesitylene, benzotrifluoride, acetone, DMSO and DMF), the application of a stronger oxidant (H2O2) or the introduction of visible light [39,40]. However, those methods remained ineffective. Therefore, a better solution is required. Acetic acid esters were also detected in the ethanol system, but no formic acid esters were detected in the methanol system. 3.4.4 Each species produced during the reaction of benzyl alcohol and methanol To detect the contents of each species during the oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol with methanol, an experiment with a slower reaction rate was designed in air. As observed in Fig. 5 , benzyl alcohol was completely converted into methyl benzoate after 8h. Benzaldehyde originally existed in the substrates and finally transformed into methyl benzoate. Moreover, a small amount of benzylate appeared in the intermediate process. However, this species finally disappeared due to its transesterification with methanol. 3.4.5 The self-oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol To study the self-oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol, some inert solvents were employed to replace methanol or ethanol, preventing cross-reactions with the two types of alcohols. The conversion of benzyl alcohol in different solvents increased when the reaction time was prolonged (Table 3 ). Analysis of the products revealed that the conversion of benzyl alcohol in petroleum ether reached 47.4%, 56.7% and 66.7% after 4, 8 and 12h, respectively, and the selectivities of benzaldehyde and benzylate were 25.7% and 74.3%, respectively (Table 3, entry 1). Obviously, the conversion of benzyl alcohol decreased as the solvent polarity index increased due to the solvation effect (Excluding CCl4 and toluene; we will study the unusual phenomenon observed in CCl4 and toluene in the future). However, the selectivity of benzaldehyde increased as the solvent polarity index increased due to an induction effect caused by the solvent. The higher the solvent polarity index, the stronger interaction of the solvent with alcohol or aldehyde, and the reaction occurs more difficult. In conclusion, the polarity index of the solvent strongly affected the self-oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol. A lower solvent polarity index corresponded to a higher ester yield. Wells et al. [41] reported that a polar solvent would slow the rate of esterification. Therefore, solvents with lower polarity indexes favor the self-reaction of benzyl alcohol."
11,Reaction mechanism,"3.5 Reaction mechanism As shown in Table 1 (entries 2, 3, 9 and 10), the gold, supports, base and O2 were all needed during the aerobic oxidative esterification of alcohols. Moreover, the gold nanoparticle surfaces can adsorb O2 to reduce the OO bond energy or help dissociate O2 to form active oxygen species [17,28]. Therefore, a tentative mechanism was proposed for the oxidative esterification of alcohols and the transfer process for O2 (Scheme 1 ) [17,26,28,42]. First, the alcohol molecules (R1CH2OH) were adsorbed on the support surface due to the difference in electronegativity between the two species. The interaction between the oxygen atoms of the alcohols and the metal cations of the supports, as well as the interaction between the hydrogen atoms of alcohol hydroxyl groups and oxygen anions of the supports, weakened the O–H bonds of the alcohols. Under basic conditions provided by Cs2CO3, the H+ from the alcohols’ –OH was captured by CO3 2−, forming structure III with a negative charge on the oxygen atom. The α-H was attracted by the O2 adsorbed on the gold nanoparticles surface, biasing the electron cloud of the oxygen atom toward the carbon atom. Then, the α-H was removed as H− from structure III, forming an oxygen–carbon double bond. Concurrently, the O2 double bond was broken, and an O–H bond was formed to produce Oad − ←O–H. (Oad −represents the oxygen ion adsorbed on the gold nanoparticles surface, and ← represents the coordination bond between Oad − and O.) Another un-adsorbed alcohol (R2OH) and structure IV rapidly undertook a nucleophilic addition reaction to form hemiacetal VI (structure V was quickly converted into structure VI). Similar to the interaction of R1CH2OH with the supports, an interaction between the hemiacetals and the supports weakened the bond of the hemiacetal hydroxyl group. Consequently, the H+ from the –OH of the hemiacetal was captured by CO3 2−, forming structure VII. The α-H of structure VII was also attracted by the oxygen atom of Oad − ←O–H (or adsorbed O2) on the gold nanoparticles. Simultaneously, the two bonding electrons over Oad − ←O in Oad − ←O–H moved from the oxygen atom (O) to the adsorbed oxygen anion (Oad −). Concurrently, the H+ in the Oad − ←O–H was strongly attracted by the electron-rich oxygen anion (Oad −). Finally, the H+ was transferred to Oad −, and the bond in Oad − ←O was broken; 2OH− and an ester were formed, leaving the gold nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticle surfaces could then re-adsorb oxygen from the reaction environment, beginning a new reaction process. As observed from Scheme 1, negatively charged structure III was generated during the reaction. An electric field existed between structure III and the polar solvent, surrounding structure III with solvent molecules. Therefore, structure III became relatively stable, and its reactivity decreased, lowering the conversion of the alcohol. The interaction between the charged structure and the solvent molecules is the solvation effect mentioned above. An induction effect existed between structure IV and the polar solvents, reducing the electropositivity of the C on the CO of structure IV and reducing the opportunities for nucleophilic addition reaction between aldehyde and alcohol when increasing the solvent polarity. Finally, ester formation was prevented, making the product more likely to remain an aldehyde. Therefore, in polar solvents, the alcohol conversion decreased, and the selectivity of the ester also decreased for the self-oxidative esterification of the alcohol. The interactions between the solvent and reactant molecules always existed, but they were strongest in the appearance of structure III and structure IV mentioned above."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, excellent catalytic performance was demonstrated during the direct oxidative esterification of alcohols to form esters over Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2 with the use of dioxygen as an oxidant under ambient temperature and pressure. Practical application is possible due to the simple process, mild conditions, excellent yields and environmental friendliness. A possible mechanism was provided, and the reaction pathways from the alcohols to the esters were described in detail."
