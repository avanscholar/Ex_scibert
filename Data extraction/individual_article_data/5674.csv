0,Introduction,"Carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) are widely used in aerospace, automotive, railway, marine and wind power generation fields due to their lightweight and high-strength properties [1–3]. However, the high cost of carbon fiber (CF) has limited the wide application and commercialization of CFRCs [4,5]. Moreover, compared with its excellent tensile properties, the interlaminar shear properties of CFRCs are very poor [6,7]. At present, the preparation of hybrid fiber reinforced composites (HFRCs) by mixing CF and glass fiber (GF) is an effective way to prepare high-performance and low-cost composites [8,9]. Compared with CF, glass/carbon hybrid fiber (GF/CF) has the advantages of good ductility, improved impact resistance and low cost [10,11]. Furthermore, the hybrid interface in HFRCs presents a multilevel failure mode, which improves the failure strain and comprehensive mechanical properties of the composites to a certain extent [12–14]. However, the smooth surface and chemical inertness of the inorganic fiber lead to a weak interface binding force between the inorganic fiber and the resin matrix, which makes the interlaminar shear performance of the composites unsatisfactory [15,16]. In recent years, the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene oxide (GO) and other carbon-based nanomaterials onto the fiber surface has been regarded as an effective method to improve the interfacial properties of composites, which can effectively increase the specific surface area of the fiber surface, the mechanical riveting force and the chemical bonding force between the fiber and the resin matrix [17–21]. Moreover, carbon-based nanomaterials have an effective strategy to enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness of the composite by inhibiting the initiation and propagation of cracks [22–25]. A variety of techniques have been applied to deposit carbon-based nanomaterials onto the surface of fibers, such as the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical grafting, and the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. However, the CVD method is not practically applicable due to its high temperatures, expensive catalysts and harsh conditions [26]. From the point of view of chemical grafting, the surface of CF needs additional treatment (such as harsh acid oxidation or functionalization) to form surface functional groups before grafting, which often damages the bulk strength of CF [27,28]. Compared with CVD and chemical grafting, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique has been widely used for surface modification because it does not need harsh conditions or damage to the bulk strength of the fiber [29]. However, due to the weak physical adsorption between GO and GO on the fiber surface, the GO layer is easy to separate under stress. In addition, creating a simple deposition of PDA onto the surface of fibers with oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine is receiving increased attention, in which PDA creates a thin layer that acts as a bridge [30,31]. Furthermore, the introduction of nanomaterials into the coating considerably improved the adhesion of the fiber and the polymer matrix [32,33]. Water-soluble PVA, which contains a large number of hydroxyl groups in its molecular chain, can react with the chemical groups on the surface of other materials to form chemical connections, as well as form physical hydrogen bonds and chelation to form strong connections. Compared with dopamine, it is a simple and efficient method to modify the fiber surface with PVA solution or PVA solution with nanomaterials. The resin matrix, as a continuous phase material for bonding fibers and transmitting loads, plays a decisive role in the mechanical properties of composites. The high tear strength and flexibility of polyurethane rank it superior over other resin matrices (e.g., epoxy and unsaturated resins) [34,35]. In addition, the introduction of different nanomaterials onto the fiber surface has different effects on the interface structure and properties. The GO coating reinforcement results in better wettability than the CNT coating, but the enhancement only occurs in the in-plane modulus [36,37]. Due to the excellent wettability of the GO coating, in combination with the interlock effect of the CNT coating, a three-dimensional nanocoating was built by combining two-dimensional GO and one-dimensional OCNTs [38,39]. In the present work, an approach of introducing a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), GO and OCNT (PVA-GO-OCNT) hybrid coating between hybrid fibers (HFs) and a resin matrix (polyurethane, PU) to enhance the interfacial interaction is reported, which is simpler, more effective and more continuous than the reported mechanisms of preparing multiscale fiber reinforcements. The HFs are CF and GF, respectively. PVA-GO-OCNT-modified HF (PVA-GO-OCNT–HF)–reinforced PU (PVA-GO-OCNT-HF/PU) composites were prepared by pultrusion technology. In addition, the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating can produce a coating with strong adhesion on the fiber surface and could result in improved mechanical properties due to the excellent interfacial interactions between resin and HFs. The effects of PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating-reinforced HFs and hybrid structures on HFRCs were investigated systematically. Based on the obtained results, the reinforcing mechanism of the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating and hybrid structure were discussed."

All materials were used as received without any further purification."
3,Preparation of PVA-GO-OCNTs modified hybrid fibers,"2.2 Preparation of PVA-GO-OCNTs modified hybrid fibers PVA-GO-OCNT mixture: First, a certain amount of GO-OCNTs (0.5 g, 1.0 g and 1.5 g, mass ratio of GO and OCNTs is 1:1) was sonically dispersed in 100 mL deionized water to form a homogenous black dispersion. Second, 1.5 g PVA was added to the GO-OCNT dispersion under continuous stirring at 95 °C for 2 h to form a homogenous black mixture (PVA-GO-OCNTs). Third, the mixture was cooled naturally to room temperature and sonicated for 30 min. The mixture of PVA-GO-OCNTs containing 0.5 g, 1.0 g and 1.5 g of GO-OCNTs was marked M1, M2 and M3, respectively. Preparation of PVA-GO-OCNT-modified hybrid fibers (PVA-GO-OCNT-HF): The GF/CF hybrid fibers were completely immersed in a PVA-GO-OCNT mixture, sonicated for 10 min, dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 10 h, and cooled naturally to room temperature. M1-, M2-and M3-modified GF and CF were marked M1-GF, M1-CF, M2-GF, M2-CF, M3-GF and M3-CF, respectively. The preparation procedure for PVA-GO-OCNTs and PVA-GO-OCNTs-HFs is illustrated in Fig. 1 a."
4,Preparation of hybrid fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites,"2.3 Preparation of hybrid fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites PU resin mixture: A certain amount of two-component polyurethane for pultrusion was mixed evenly and degassed for 15 min. The mass ratio of premixed polyol and polymeric MDI in two-component polyurethane was 1.25:1. Then, the mixture was cast into a dip tank. Hybrid composites: Unidirectional CF-reinforced polyurethane composites (CF/PU), GF-reinforced polyurethane composites (GF/PU), HF-reinforced polyurethane composites (HFs/PU), and PVA-GO-OCNT–HF–reinforced polyurethane composites (PVA-GO-OCNTs-HFs/PU) with diameters of 8.0 mm were all fabricated by a pultrusion process. The scheme for the pultrusion process is shown in Fig. 1b. Photographs of the rod composites are shown in Fig. S1. The preparation of hybrid composites with different concentric hybrid structures was realized by controlling the CF and GF to enter the curing mold after passing through the guide wire holes at different positions on the thread plate according to the set section structure (as shown in Table 1 ). The volume ratio of CF to GF in the concentric hybrid structure is fixed at 1:1 (the mass ratio is approximately 1:1.5). Mass fraction of HFs in HFRCs was approximately 70.0 wt%."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The surface morphologies of the HFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Sigma 300, UK). The chemical structures of the untreated GF, CF and PVA-GO-OCNTs-HFs were examined based on Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR, model 6700, Nicolet, USA). The surface chemical elements of the CFs were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 220i-XL, UK). The tensile tests were conducted following ASTM D 3916-94 [40]. A load cell of 10 kN and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min were used in these tests. For each type of composite, six specimens were tested to failure and were used to calculate the average tensile value. Interlaminar shear tests were performed on a universal testing machine at a displacement rate of 1 mm/min, according to International Standard ISO 3597-4: 2003. To evaluate whether the hybrid structure generated a positive or negative effect, the calculation of the mechanical properties of the hybrid fiber composite followed the rule of mixtures, in the form of Eq. (1): (1) P Hybrid = P 1V1 + P 2(1-V 1) where P Hybrid is a given property of the hybrid composite; P1 and P 2 are the mechanical properties of the carbon fiber composite and glass fiber composite, respectively; V 1 is the carbon composite volume fraction. The hybrid effect for tensile failure strain, tensile and interlaminar shear strength is calculated from Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), as shown in the supplementary information."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Surface modified HFs,"3.1 Surface modified HFs Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the fiber before and after modification by hybrid coating, and the SEM images of PVA-modified fibers are shown in Fig. S2. Comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, it can be seen that the PVA-GO-CNT hybrid coating on the fiber surface is uniform and dense with a large surface roughness. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, both unmodified GF and CF show smooth surfaces. Grooved defects arranged along the axis direction of unmodified CF were formed in the production process [41]. As shown in Fig. 2a’ and b′, when GF and CF infiltrated M1, the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating uniformly covered the fiber surface, which became rough and presented a lamellar structure. As shown in Fig. 2b’, PVA-GO-OCNTs are mainly concentrated in the grooves, and the depth of the grooves on the surface of CF is obviously shallower, which makes up the defects of GF to some extent. Compared with M1-CF and M1-GF, the convex pits and burrs on the surface of the fibers modified by M2 are more well defined (Fig. 2a’’ and b’‘), which is beneficial to the mechanical riveting and friction between the reinforced fiber and the matrix resin, as well as enhancing the interface adhesion between the reinforced fiber and the resin [35,42]. However, as the content of GO-OCNTs in PVA-GO-OCNTs increased to 2.0 wt%, the hybrid coating on the fiber surface became extremely uneven and presented a large number of lumpy bulges caused by the high content of GO/OCNT agglomeration (Fig. 2a’’’ and b’’’), which was detrimental to the improvement of the interfacial performance of the composite. The surface functional groups of the fibers before and after PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating modification were examined by FTIR, as presented in Fig. 3 (a). Compared with unmodified GF and CF, several characteristic peaks appear in the FTIR spectra of M2-GF and M2-CF. The spectrum of unmodified GF showed two peaks at 3430 cm−1 and 1035 cm−1, which can be assigned to O–H stretching vibrations and Si–O stretching vibrations [17]. For the spectrum of M2-GF, the characteristic peak at 3368 cm−1 is observed for the –OH functionality, and the peaks at 1745 cm−1, 1625 cm−1, 1180 cm−1 and 860 cm−1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of CO (1745 cm−1), CC (1625 cm−1), C–O (1180 cm−1) and C–C (860 cm−1), respectively [6]. The peaks at 2933 cm−1 (C–H stretching vibration) and 1420 cm−1 (-CH2 bending vibration) provide evidence of PVA existence [8]. In the spectrum of unmodified CF, the characteristic band at 3365 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration peaks of N–H bonds. The spectrum of M2-CF is similar to that of M2-GF, in which the characteristic peaks correspond to the characteristic absorption peaks of the main functional groups of PVA and GO-OCNTs. The TGA curves of neat GF, neat CF, M2-GF and M2-CF further show that the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating is successfully coated on the fiber surface, as shown in Fig. S3. Many studies indicate that these rich functional groups can improve the wettability of the fibers and the hydrogen bonding and chemical binding properties with the resin matrix, leading to enhanced mechanical properties of the composite [15,29,37]. The chemical compositions on the surface of M2-GF and M2-CF were investigated by XPS. The global surface element abundances for M2-GF and M2-CF are presented in Table 2 . C, O and N are the most abundant elements on the fiber surfaces. Other elements are present in concentrations lower than 2.0 wt%. After modification of the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating, the element abundance values of O for M2-GF and M2-CF are 28.1% and 22.6%, respectively, and their O/C ratios are as high as 40.7% and 30.1%, respectively. The main reason for the increased oxygen concentration on the surface of M2-GF and M2-CF is the successful coating of the PVA-GO-OCNTS hybrid coating. High-resolution XPS spectra of the C 1 s region were examined to analyze the elemental state on the surface (Fig. 3b). The relative composition, which is expressed as the ratio of each peak area to the total peak area, is presented in Fig. 3c and d. Deconvolution of the C 1 s spectrum of M2-GF and M2-CF presents four major peaks at 284.6 eV, 285.6 eV, 286.7 eV and 288.3 eV, which are attributed to C–C, C–OH, CO and O–CO bonds, respectively [37,43]. The proportions of C–C, C–OH, CO and O–CO peaks in the C1 s spectrum of M2-GF are 28%, 26%, 26% and 20%, respectively, while the proportions of C–C, C–OH, CO and O–CO peaks in the C1 s spectrum of the M2-CF surface are 38%, 25%, 26% and 17%, respectively. The results further indicate that the surface of the fiber modified by the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating is rich in oxygen-containing functional groups, which is beneficial for enhancing the interfacial properties by improving the wettability of the fiber and its chemical binding force with the resin matrix."
8,Mechanical properties of HFs reinforced composite,"3.2 Mechanical properties of HFs reinforced composite 3.2.1 Tensile properties The tensile properties of the composites with different hybrid structures are shown in Fig. 4 . Clearly, the failure strains of the modified HF-reinforced PU composite are all better than those of the unmodified HF-reinforced PU composite, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The CF-reinforced PU (CF/PU, B) composite shows superior performance with a tensile strength of 828.43 MPa and a tensile modulus of 88.10 GPa. The GF-reinforced PU (GF/PU, A) composite shows good failure strain, reaching 2.60%, but its tensile strength and tensile modulus are all quite lower than those of CF/PU. In the process of tensile testing, A and B failed suddenly and rapidly, and A also showed an obvious splitting phenomenon, which was caused by the rapid propagation of cracks, leading to delamination and fracture in the fiber layer [44]. The tensile properties of the unmodified HF-reinforced PU composites (C1 and C2) are all higher than those of A and lower than those of B. It appears that the hybrid structure has a direct effect on the tensile strength and failure strain of the composite but has little effect on the tensile modulus of the composite. In the theory of crack propagation inhibition, CF with low elongation at break produces cracks first and propagates rapidly, and GF around CF can inhibit or even prevent the propagation of cracks to avoid the rapid growth of cracks [37]. Accordingly, the tensile property of C1 with a high concentration of CF should be better than that of C2. By contrast, the tensile test results show that the tensile strength of C2 is much higher than that of C1; although, the tensile modulus and failure strain of C2 and C1 are similar. This phenomenon is related to the stress transfer path in the composite. In the tensile test, HFRCs mainly bear the longitudinal tensile stress and the transverse shear stress, in which the longitudinal tensile stress is mainly borne by CF with low elongation at failure, and the shear stress is first borne by the outer fiber and then transferred to the inner fiber through the resin matrix [16,38]. At this time, whether the shear stress can be effectively transferred from the outer fiber part to the inner fiber part depends on the strength of the interface between the fiber and the resin. The GF/PU part located in the outer layer of C1 relies on its own better ductility to transfer the stress to the CF/PU part located in the inner layer. With increasing stress, the outer layer first splits under transverse shear stress, resulting in the failure of the composites, while the CF/PU part located in the inner layer fails to give full play to its performance advantages, as shown in the stress vs. strain curve of C1 (as shown in Fig. 4c). However, in the tensile test of C2, part of the outer CF/PU layer breaks first, and the inner GF layer continues to bear the test load. Moreover, the fracture energy released by the abrupt failure of the outer CF/PU destroyed the residual bearing capacity of the inner GF (as shown in Fig. 4c), so the failure strain of C2 is nearly C1. In the process of tensile testing, A, B, C1 and C2 all have different degrees of splitting or fracture sound, and their failure mode belongs to brittle failure. The cracks expand rapidly once generated, resulting in the stratification and fracture of the fiber layer. The fracture process of the A composites and B is rapid and sudden, which also shows an obvious splitting phenomenon. Compared with C1, the splitting sound in the failure process of C2 is more rapid and dense, accompanied by obvious fiber fracture sound. The advantage of HF-reinforced composites is that the performance advantage of both fibers can be exploited simultaneously [35]. However, due to the poor interface adhesion between GF and PU, the internal CF in C1 fails to maximize its performance advantage. The fracture energy released by sudden fracture of CF outside of C2 damages the ability of GF inside of C2 to continue to bear the test load; thus, the performance advantage of GF is not fully exerted. Therefore, to make full use of the performance advantage of HFs, the interfacial performance of the composite should be improved. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the tensile properties of PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating-modified fiber-reinforced composites are significantly enhanced compared with those of the unmodified composites. The tensile strength of M-B (1114.65 MPa) is still the highest. Compared with A, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and failure strain of M-A are increased by 31.1%, 18.2% and 7.9%, respectively. Compared with B, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and failure strain of M-B are increased by 34.6%, 23.4% and 8.0%, respectively. The tensile properties of M-C1 and M-C2 with concentric hybrid structures are still between those of M-A and M-B. The tensile strength increases from 723.01 MPa (C1) and 758.58 MPa (C2) to 1060.26 MPa (M-C1) and 1018.96 MPa (M-C2). In contrast to the tensile properties of C1 and C2, the tensile strength of M-C1 is higher than that of M-C2, while the failure strain of M-C1 is significantly lower than that of M-C2. The change in tensile properties directly correlates with the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating on the fiber surface. The PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating forms a strong interaction, multiphase and multilevel hybrid interface structure between the fiber and resin matrix, which contributes to a better stress transfer in the composite from the resin matrix to the fiber [14]. In addition, the nanocarbon materials in the hybrid coating can deflect or even prevent the growth of the internal cracks of the composites and play a role in toughening the composite [11]. Due to this, the failure strain of the modified composites is increased. Due to the strong interface adhesion between the resin matrix and toughening of nanomaterials, the outer GF of M-C1 can effectively transfer the transverse shear stress to the inner highly concentrated CF in the process of tensile testing. As shown in the tensile stress vs. strain curve of M-C1 (Fig. 4c), modified CF can give full play to its superior properties, thus significantly improving the tensile properties of the composite. For M-C2, the dispersed CF in the periphery leads to a lower tensile strength than M-C1. However, the strong interfacial interaction and the toughening effect of nanomaterials weaken the brittle fracture of the outer CF layer and reduce the influence of fracture energy released by sudden fracture of the outer CF layer on the residual bearing capacity of the inner GF layer. Furthermore, the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating improves the effective load carrying capacity of HFs in the composite. The highly concentrated GF in the center of M-C2 can still bear the test force after the breakage of the dispersed CF in the periphery (see the tensile stress vs. strain curve of M-C2), so it has a high failure strain. The deviation from the rule of mixtures (RoM) in tensile properties for the unmodified composite and modified composite is presented in Fig. 4d–f. As shown in Fig. 4d–f, the unmodified composite shows a negative hybrid effect in terms of tensile strength and elongation at failure, and its tensile modulus is consistent with the calculated RoM. This obvious negative hybrid effect is caused by the poor interfacial interaction between GF and resin. For this reason, C1 fails for the in-layer damage of the outer GF/PU part, and the inner CF/PU part of C1 fails to play a load-bearing role. When HFs are modified by the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating, the influence of the hybrid structure on the tensile properties of the composite becomes more obvious. M-C1 has a hybrid structure with dispersed GF as the outer shell to inhibit crack propagation from the center CF in the case of strong interface performance and centralized CF as the inner core, providing high performance. Consequently, M-C1 shows a positive hybrid effect of +4.3% in tensile strength (Fig. 4d). In contrast to its tensile strength, M-C1 in failure strain shows a negative hybrid effect of −2.2% (Fig. 4f). The externally dispersed GF with higher strain is damaged first, and the inner CF layer that continues to bear the load has a low elongation, resulting in a low failure strain of C1 and M-C1. This is the defect of hybrid structure of C1 and M-C1. Similarly, for M-C2, there is a significant positive hybrid effect of +21% in failure strain, which comes from the hybrid structure and enhanced interface performance. In this regard, due to the enhanced interface performance, the residual bearing capacity of the internal GF is significantly improved, which fully utilizes the ductility of the internal GF in this hybrid structure. In Fig. 4e, M-C1 and M-C2 show a considerable hybrid effect of approximately 9%. It should be noted that the tensile modulus of both M-A and M-B increased by 25% compared with A and B, while an increase in tensile modulus of M-C1 (or M-C2) over that of C1 (or C2) approached 36%, which suggests that the tensile modulus mainly depends on the hybrid ratio rather than the hybrid structure. The fracture surface morphology of the composite after tensile tests was examined by SEM, as shown in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5, the surface of GF is smooth (Fig. 5a), which leads to poor interface adhesion between GF and resin, so the interface failure mode is debonding failure (Fig. 6 a). Some resin is attached to the surface of CF, which indicates that the interfacial interaction between CF and PU is relatively strong due to its high surface roughness (Fig. 5b). When the CF/PU part is damaged, the crack propagates along the interface and spreads to the resin matrix, and its interface failure mode is mainly debonding failure (Fig. 6b). Additionally, from fractured images of C1 and C2, it can be seen that there are serious cracks at the interface between GF and CF (Fig. 5e and f), which shows that the resin matrix is pulled between GF and CF interface under tensile load, resulting in resin debonding and fragmentation. After the fiber is modified by the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating, the polyurethane matrix is tightly wrapped on the fiber surface due to the strong physical and chemical binding force between the fiber surface and the resin, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. When the modified composites are damaged, the propagation direction of the crack shifts in the hybrid coating, which effectively limits the development of the crack at the interface and absorbs the failure energy. Therefore, the interface failure mode of the composite changes from debonding failure to matrix resin failure (Fig. 6c). 3.2.2 Interlaminar shear strength and hybrid effect The interlaminar shear properties of the composite are presented in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 7a, the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the composite can be enhanced by introducing a PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating to the interphase of the composite. ILSS values increase from 35.55 MPa (A) and 38.13 MPa (B) to 42.19 MPa (M-A) and 45.82 MPa (M-B). Compared with C1 (39.13 MPa) and C2 (39.41 MPa), the ILSS of M-C1 (57.31 MPa) and M-C2 (50.19 MPa) are increased by 18.78% and 11.48%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a, the ILSS of HFRCs modified by PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating is significantly enhanced. The above results illustrate that it is very effective to introduce PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coatings on the fiber surface to improve the mechanical properties of the composites. Compared with the modification method reported in the literature [26–31], this method is simpler. The shear load vs. displacement curves of the composite shown in Fig. 7b can indicate the shear failure process of the composite. In the interlaminar shear test of the composite, the upper part of the specimen is compressed, while the bottom part is mainly subjected to tensile force along the fiber axis (Fig. 7d) [6]. The load vs. displacement curves show a trend of sudden decline after the linear rise to the peak, which is attributed to the initial failure of the “brittleness” at the bottom of the specimen. The peak load of A is lower than that of B, but it can continue to bear the load for good ductility, presenting a loading platform in the load vs. displacement curve. For B, after the occurrence of “brittleness” initial failure, it abruptly develops into composite failure. For C1, the externally uniformly distributed GF first takes the load and gradually transfers it to CF in the core. After the bottom GF/CF hybrid interface is broken, the composite rapidly fails. Therefore, the variation trend of load vs. displacement curve for C1 is similar to that of A, but its stiffness is obviously better than that of A. Similarly, the initial variation trend of load vs. displacement curve for C2 is the same as that of B. However, with the increase of test load, the CF located at the periphery of the specimen bottom breaks first, and the load value dropped rapidly, which destroyed the residual capacity of internal GF. Then, the internal GF and the upper CF continue to bear the load, and the ductility advantage of GF and the strength advantage of CF play simultaneously, because the load shows a slow rise and then a gradual decline in a long period of displacement until secondary failure occurs by GF failure [9]. For M-C1, due to the enhanced interfacial interaction between GF and the resin matrix, the stress can be effectively transferred, and the performance of the inner CF is fully utilized, resulting in the highest ILSS. Compared with C2, the load decreases less when the initial failure occurs in M-C2 (due to external CF failure), and the load peak in the second half is higher, which indicates that the rapid failure mode of the outer CF/PU part of the composite has been improved and the residual capacity of the inner GF/PU part has also been enhanced. This is due to the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating between the fiber and resin enhancing the properties of the composite and inhibiting the generation and propagation of internal cracks [13]. The broken morphology of PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating-modified fiber-reinforced composites is shown in Fig. S3. The hybrid effect of ILSS for the unmodified composite and the modified composite is presented in Fig. 7c. For the unmodified composite, C1 and C2 show a positive hybrid effect. It can be concluded that the hybrid effect in ILSS is related to the shear failure mechanism of the composite. In the shear test, the fiber with lower failure dominates the stress field and first produces microcracks, while the surrounding fiber with higher failure can inhibit the propagation of microcracks. In C1, GF prevents the crack from propagating outwards; in contrast, GF prevents the crack from propagating inwards in C2. However, due to the poor interfacial interaction of GF/PU, GF at the bottom of C1 is first damaged, and cracks develop into the resin, resulting in the failure of the composite. Therefore, when the interfacial interaction is enhanced, M-C1 shows the best hybrid effect. The influence of the hybrid structure on the hybrid effect is confirmed by a similar analysis of unmodified and modified composites. The results showed that the interface performance is the key to playing a positive role in the hybrid effect and the advantage of the HF structure [44]. The fracture surface morphology of the composite after the ILSS test was characterized by SEM, as shown in Fig. 8 . As shown in Fig. 8a, many GFs are pulled out, and the exposed GFs are smooth. Therefore, interface peeling is the main failure mode of GF/PU. The shear failure of CF/PU is mainly caused by CF fracture, accompanied by delamination failure (Fig. 8b). As shown in Fig. 8c and d, the main failure modes of the GF/PU part and CF/PU part are fiber fracture and delamination failure. After the HFs are modified by the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating, the survival rate of interfacial defects between the fiber and the PU resin is lower, and the interfacial binding force is higher, which significantly reduces the delamination failure of the fiber and the appearance of GF pulling out. The improvement in the interlaminar shear performance of the composites is due to the increase in the interaction area and interfacial adhesion between the fiber and the resin matrix by the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating in the phase interval of the composites."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, a PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating was adopted to modify CF and GF. The results of the analysis indicated that the PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating can increase the interfacial interaction between hybrid fibers and the PU resin matrix. On this basis, the synergistic mechanism of the hybrid interface and hybrid structure on the mechanical properties of hybrid fiber composites was explored. The test results of the mechanical properties show that the mechanical properties of C1 are lower than those of C2 because the poor GF-PU-GF interface structure destroyed the positive effect of the concentric hybrid structure on the failure mechanism of the composite. However, in the modified hybrid fiber-reinforced composite system, the mechanical properties of M-C1 are higher than those of M-C2 because the advantages of fiber properties in the hybrid structure of the composite are brought into full play after the hybrid interface is modified by PVA-GO-OCNTs, which is the result of the collaborative reinforcement of the hybrid interface modification and hybrid structure. In summary, this work demonstrates that introducing a PVA-GO-OCNT hybrid coating into the interface area of the composite is a simple and effective method to improve the mechanical properties of the composite, which provides excellent potential for the practical application of hybrid fiber composites. Moreover, the research results show the potential value for applications in electronic products and equipment that require high mechanical properties and certain electrical or thermal properties (see Table S2)."
