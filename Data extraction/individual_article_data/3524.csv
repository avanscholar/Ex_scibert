0,Introduction,"Historically, the production of high-value monophenols (Van den Bosch et al., 2015b), alkanes (Xia et al., 2016), organic acids (Pang et al., 2021; Song et al., 2019) and materials (Chen et al., 2019) from lignin had developed rapidly due to the significance of lignin in the biorefinery. According to whether lignin is separated from lignocellulose in advance, the conversion process can be divided into one-pot and two-pot method. The advantage of the two-pot method is that pure lignin derivatives can be obtained, avoiding the influence of cellulose and hemicellulose. The disadvantage is that the operation process is complicated and cumbersome, and the separated lignin is prone to condensation, which is not conducive to further conversion (Liu et al., 2019; Nandiwale et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017). The operating process of the one-pot method is simple, and the high yield of products can be obtained by virtue of the advantages of in-situ depolymerization (Lin et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021b). Sels et al. studied the one-pot conversion of sawdust with Ru/C catalyst, and the yield of monomers aromatics reached 50% (Van den Bosch et al., 2015a). In the process of one-pot conversion of lignin, the bond between lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose is broken firstly, and then the separated lignin is depolymerized to monomers aromatics. One strategy to increase the yield of monomers is to increase the removal rate of lignin. Brønsted acid was widely used for removed lignin, because H+ could break the bond between lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose (An et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2021). Therefore, the catalyst could contain Brønsted acid sites (BASs) to remove lignin from lignocellulose. The second strategy to increase the yield of monomers was to achieve efficient depolymerization of lignin (Li et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Ni-based catalyst was an extensively used catalyst for the depolymerization of lignin. Yang et al. (2019) used Ni/Mo2C catalyst to depolymerize corn stover lignin, and the yield of monomers was 37.3% (250 °C, 4 h, 40 bar H2). Moreover, the addition of the second metal in the Ni-based catalyst could increase the activity and stability (Chowdari et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021a; Zhai et al., 2017). In our previous research, it was found that the addition of Sn to nickel oxide (NiSnOx) could significantly increase the number of Lewis acid sites (LASs) and achieve efficient depolymerization of kraft lignin. However, NiSnOx did not have BASs (Zhang et al., 2020). In order to increase BASs, phosphorus could be added to NiSnOx. Nicholas et al. proposed that the introduction of phosphate into ceria could generate BASs (Nelson et al., 2017). The addition of other metals to aluminum phosphate could also produce BASs due to the difference in valence between metals, and the number of BASs could be controlled by adjusting the amount of other metals (Pastore et al., 2005). In addition, Moon et al. found that adding phosphorus to Ni-based catalysts could also increase the hydrogenation ability through the electronic and geometrical effects between Ni and P (Goncalves et al., 2017; Moon et al., 2014), and NiP-based catalysts showed better hydrodeoxygenation ability than Ni-based catalysts (Berenguer et al., 2016; Moon et al., 2014). The depolymerization of lignin and model compound by BASs, LASs and hydrogenation sites (HSs) had been extensively studied. Deepa et al. studied the depolymerization of lignin by hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and the products were dimers and oligomers (Deepa and Dhepe, 2015). In order to prevent the condensation of products during the process of depolymerized lignin with Brønsted acid, blocking agents such as diols, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and aldehyde were used (Deuss et al., 2015; Qi et al., 2020). The mechanism of Lewis acid on the depolymerization of lignin was not clear. Shu et al. believed that the liquefaction rate of lignin was related to the valence of metals (Shu et al., 2015). Constant et al. (2015) pointed out that the yield of monomers was related to the hardness of Lewis acid. Yang et al. (2014) proposed that the Lewis acidity didn’t match the ability to break CO bonds. In addition, hydrogenation catalysts such as Ni/C, Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C and Rh/C were also used to depolymerize lignin (Bjelic et al., 2019; Van den Bosch et al., 2015a; Zhu et al., 2019). BASs, LASs and HSs were commonly used in the depolymerization of lignin and model compounds, but there were few studies on the one-pot depolymerization of lignocellulose. Studying the synergistic effect of BASs, LASs and HSs in the one-pot depolymerization of lignocellulose is very helpful for the design of catalysts. According to the above research results, a catalyst contained BASs, LASs and HSs was prepared by doping nickel into tin phosphate, which was used for one-pot conversion of corn stover lignin into monomers. H2 was discarded from a safety point of view, and hydrogen was supplied through solvent. The synergistic effect of BASs, LASs and HSs in the one-step depolymerization of corn stover lignin was studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts NiSnP2O7: 2.50 g DPA·H3PO4 (Jin et al., 2014), 1.74 g SnCl4·5H2O, 0.20 g TEABr, 0.72 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.49 g Urea were ground. The mixture was reacted in a 100 ml Teflon reactor (200 °C for 24 h) without solvent, and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. The obtained sample was named Ni0.5SnP2O7. When Ni0.25SnP2O7, Ni1.0SnP2O7 and Ni2.0SnP2O7 were prepared, the masses of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were 0.36 g, 1.44 g and 2.88 g, and the masses of urea were 1.34 g, 1.79 g and 2.39 g. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and SnCl4·5H2O were not added when SnP2O7 and Ni2(P4O12) were prepared. Ni/C: The calcium lignosulfonate was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h under the protection of N2, and washed with hydrochloric acid (1 M) to obtain the carrier carbon. 0.247 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was impregnated on 1 g carrier carbon, and then calcined at 550 °C for 4 h under the protection of N2. The resulting sample was dispersed in 20 ml of water. In addition, 0.07 g of NaBH4 was dissolved in 20 ml of water. The NaBH4 solution was added drop wise to the sample solution and stirred for 10 min. The sample was filtered and washed, and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. The loading amount of Ni is 5 wt%. Ni0.5SnOx was prepared by the previous method (Zhang et al., 2020). 0.72 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.74 g SnCl4·5H2O and 1.49 g of urea were dissolved in 100 ml of the tert-Butanol/H2O (v/v = 9/1). The solution was transferred into a 250 ml autoclave and reacted at 100 °C for 24 h. The collected solid was washed and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. Finally, the sample was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h."
3,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.2 Catalytic activity measurements 1 g corn stover (or organosolv lignin), 0.2 g catalyst and 30 ml methanol were placed in a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave reactor, the reaction conditions was 235 °C for 3 h. When 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)propane-1,3-diol (PPPD) was depolymerized, 50 mg PPPD, 50 mg catalyst and 10 ml methanol were placed in a 25 ml stainless steel autoclave reactor, the reaction conditions was 200 °C for 3 h. The air in the reactor was replaced by N2. After the reaction, 0.01 g of acetophenone was added as an internal standard, and then the reaction solution was separated for the detection of GC-MS and GC. In addition, 1 ml of the reaction solution was collected and diluted with water to 20 ml for the detection of HPLC. The solid residue was washed with ethanol and dried at 80 °C, and then subjected to component analysis and recovery of catalyst. When H3PO4 was used as the catalyst, its amount of substance was equal to the number of BASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7."
4,Results and discussion,
5,The structure of catalysts,"3.1 The structure of catalysts The phase composition of the catalyst was determined by XRD ( Fig. 1a and b). The structure of the prepared samples were Ni2(P4O12) (PDF no. 86-2160) and SnP2O7 (PDF no. 29-1352) respectively when a single metal was added. Ni0.25SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnP2O7 were still dominated by the structure of SnP2O7, and no diffraction peaks related to nickel were observed, which was related to the high dispersion of Ni species. The diffraction peak of Ni2(P4O12) began to appear in Ni1.0SnP2O7, while there were obvious diffraction peaks of SnP2O7 and Ni2(P4O12) in Ni2.0SnP2O7, which was actually similar to the physical mixing of SnP2O7 and Ni2(P4O12). Therefore, Ni species was the most dispersed among Ni0.5SnP2O7. At the same time, the diffraction peak of (200) in NiSnP2O7 shifted compared with SnP2O7, indicated that the incorporation of Ni species changed the crystal structure of SnP2O7 (Fig. 1b). In addition, a mixed metal oxide of nickel and tin was prepared (Ni0.5SnOx), and the diffraction peaks of Ni species cannot be observed due to its high dispersion. For specific information about Ni0.5SnOx, please refer to our previous report (Zhang et al., 2020). In order to further confirm the incorporation of Ni into the lattice of SnP2O7, the samples were subjected to the detection of XPS (Fig. S1, Table 1). The results showed that the valence states of Ni species and Sn species were Ni+3 and Sn+4, respectively (Mansour and Melendres, 1994; Stranick and Moskwa, 1993). The Sn3d peak of Ni0.5SnP2O7 had a negative shift, while the Ni2p had a positive shift compared to Ni2(P4O12) and SnP2O7. The Sn species in Ni0.5SnP2O7 could acquire electrons on account of the higher electronegativity, while the Ni species lost electrons. In addition, the peaks of P2p and O1s in Ni0.5SnP2O7 were also shifted compared to Ni2(P4O12) and SnP2O7. The results of XPS showed that there was electron transfer between Ni and Sn, that was, there was synergy between them. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnP2O7 were both type III and had a hysteresis loop of type H3 (Fig. 1c, Table 1). The adsorption capacity in the low-pressure zone and the medium-pressure zone was low and increased slowly, indicated that there were almost no micropores in SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnP2O7. The adsorption capacity increased rapidly and a hysteresis loop appeared in the high-pressure zone. These features reflected the interstitial pores between particles, and the structure of such pores was incomplete. The chart for the distribution of pore size showed that there were almost mesoporous in SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnP2O7, that was, interstitial pores between particles. In addition, the pore volume and pore diameter of Ni0.5SnP2O7 were larger than SnP2O7, indicated that the addition of Ni increased the particle spacing (Table 1). TEM images showed that SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnP2O7 were coral-like, and there were a large number of pores between particles, which was consistent with the result of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm (Fig. 1e and f). The element distribution showed that Ni species were evenly distributed (Fig. 1g)."
6,The acidity of catalysts,"3.2 The acidity of catalysts The key property of catalyst was acidity, which was tested by NH3-TPD ( Fig. 2a). The position of the NH3 absorption peak can reflect the strength of acid sites, and the area of the absorption peak represents the number of acid sites. Ni2(P4O12) had two peaks near 200 °C and 600 °C, SnP2O7 had two peaks near 300 °C and 700 °C. These two peaks were attributed to weak acid sites and strong acid sites, respectively. Both the weak acid and strong acid absorption peak positions of SnP2O7 were higher than Ni2(P4O12), indicated that the acid strength of SnP2O7 was stronger than Ni2(P4O12). NiSnP2O7 still had weak and strong acid sites and the area of NH3 absorption peak was larger than that of SnP2O7 and Ni2(P4O12), indicated that the number of acid sites in NiSnP2O7 had increased compared to SnP2O7 and Ni2(P4O12). The number of total acid sites in Ni0.5SnP2O7 reached the highest number of 2.035 mmol g−1, which might be due to the high dispersion of Ni species in Ni0.5SnP2O7 ( Table 2). However, the number of acid sites in Ni1.0SnP2O7 was reduced compared to Ni0.5SnP2O7. There were also weak acid sites and strong acid sites in Ni0.5SnOx, but the number of surface acid sites was less than Ni0.5SnP2O7. Pyridine infrared (Py-FTIR) can detect the number of LASs and BASs in the catalyst (Fig. 2b). The peaks at 1450 cm−1 and 1540 cm−1 are attributed to the adsorption of pyridine at LASs and BASs, respectively. According to the areas of these two peaks, the number of LASs and BASs can be calculated. SnP2O7 and Ni2(P4O12) only had a small amount of LASs, and the number of LASs in SnP2O7 was slightly more than Ni2(P4O12). It was worth noted that BASs appeared in NiSnP2O7 and the number of LASs also increased significantly. The number of LASs and BASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7 all reached the maximum (Table 2). Besides, there were no BASs were detected in Ni0.5SnOx. Generally speaking, both Ni species and Sn species could provide LASs, and the formation of BASs required further exploration. FTIR was used to study the formation of BASs (Fig. 2c). The peaks near 3500 cm−1 and 1637 cm−1 were attributed to the adsorbed water. The broad peak around 1070 cm−1 was attributed to PO4 3-. In addition to the above characteristic peaks, Ni0.5SnP2O7 had another peak near 2895 cm−1, which was attributed to the -OH formed by Ni doped in SnP2O7. The generated -OH was the cause of BASs. SnP2O7 was composed of SnO6 octahedron and PO4 tetrahedron, and the valence of Sn was + 4. The sites of Sn were occupied when Ni was doped, and the valence of Ni was + 3. In order to maintain charge balance, the O between P and Ni would be protonated. The protonated site would produce a proton H, which was a Brønsted acid site (Fig. 2d). The Ni sites also provided LASs. Therefore, the number of BASs and LASs increased after Ni was incorporated into SnP2O7. The high doping amount and dispersibility of Ni species should be beneficial to increase the number of acid sites. Ni0.25SnP2O7 is subject to the amount of doping, Ni1.0SnP2O7 and Ni2.0SnP2O7 are subject to dispersion (Fig. 1a). Ni0.5SnP2O7 has the largest number of acid sites by reason of the most suitable doping amount and dispersion."
7,Catalytic activity test,"3.3 Catalytic activity test The result of GC-MS showed that the product could be divided into two parts (Fig. S4). The first part was products derived from cellulose and hemicellulose, such as furfural, 5-HMF, aliphatic acids and long chain alkanes. Among these products, only furfural and 5-HMF were quantitatively analyzed by HPLC (Fig. S4). It was believed that furfural and 5-HMF were derived from hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively. The reason for the lack of quantitative analysis of aliphatic acids and long-chain alkanes was that their sources couldn’t be determined, and there was no accurate quantitative analysis method. The other part was aromatic products derived from lignin, which could be quantitatively analyzed by GC. Fig. 3a was the yield of products when corn stover was depolymerized, and the yield of monomers was showed in Table S2. The yield of the product was based on the quality of lignin. The yield of the monomers was the most important parameter reflected the depolymerization effect of lignin. The lignin in the residue was obtained from the component analysis of residue, which reflected the ability of catalyst to remove lignin. Others represent dimers, multimers, char and gas products. The effect of the quality of the catalyst on the depolymerization of corn stover was studied (Fig. S3). The effect of 0.05 g catalyst on the reaction is not obvious. The increase in the quality of the catalyst will promote the depolymerization of corn stover lignin, but it is not necessary to increase the catalyst too much. Therefore, the quality of the catalyst is selected as 0.2 g from the perspective of depolymerization effect and economy. The yield of monomers was only 6.3%, and the content of lignin in the residue was 65.0% when no catalyst was added. The content of lignin in the residue did not change much after Ni2(P4O12) and SnP2O7 were used. The yield of monomers when Ni2(P4O12) was used was slightly higher than that when SnP2O7 was used, which was benefited from the hydrogenation capacity of Ni2(P4O12). The content of lignin in the residue was reduced, and the yield of monomers was also significantly increased after NiSnP2O7 was used. The best result was that the yield of monomers was 34.4%, and the content of lignin in the residue was 35.3% when Ni0.5SnP2O7 was used, which was related to the most number of acid sites and the most dispersed HSs in Ni0.5SnP2O7. It could be found that the yield of monomers was positively correlated with the number of acid sites of the catalyst. The content of lignin in the residue did not change much after Ni0.5SnOx and Ru/C were used compared with the blank, but the yield of monomers increased (Table S2). The reason for the low yield of monomer may be that the amount of removed lignin was small when Ni0.5SnOx and Ru/C were used. In addition, the content of lignin in the residue and the yield of monomers were 22.5% and 15.4% when H3PO4 was used. Homogeneous acid had a good effect on the removal of lignin. GPC was used to measure the molecular weight distribution of the product ( Fig. 4). For the case where the depolymerization effect of lignin was poor (no catalyst, Ni2(P4O12) or SnP2O7 were used), the product contains a large number of dimers, trimers and oligomers. But for the case where the depolymerization effect was good (Ni0.5SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnOx were used), the amount of dimers, trimers and oligomers was reduced, and the products were mainly monomers. The Mw of the product also decreased significantly after Ni0.5SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnOx were used (Table S3). Therefore, a good depolymerization effect could be reflected in the distribution of the product."
8,The influence of Brønsted acid sites,"3.4 The influence of Brønsted acid sites The BASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7 might promote the removal of lignin from corn stover, thereby the effect of Ni0.5SnP2O7 was far better than that of Ni0.5SnOx when corn stover lignin was depolymerized. In order to verify this point of view, the lignin was separated from the corn stover by pretreatment, and the obtained organosolv lignin was used as the substrate (Fig. 3b). It could be found that the yield of monomers was almost same when Ni0.5SnOx and Ni0.5SnP2O7 were used (Table S4). In this case, the lignin has been removed in advance, and the BASs cannot play role in removing lignin. The depolymerization of lignin can be achieved through LASs and HSs. This reflects the importance of BASs for the removal of lignin. Another point to be concerned about was that the yield of monomers was generally very low when the organosolv lignin was depolymerized. The lignin will undergo condensation during the removal process, which makes it more difficult to be depolymerized. The increase in the number of BASs could not only promote the removal of lignin, but also increase the conversion of glucan and xylan (Fig. S5, S6). The content of glucan and xylan in the residue were 82.1% and 67.0%, and the yields of 5-HMF and furfural were 1.5% and 3.9% when no catalyst was added. When Ni2(P4O12), SnP2O7 and Ni0.5SnOx without BASs were used as catalyst, the content of glucan and xylan in the residue did not change much compared with that no catalyst. But the content of glucan and xylan in the residue was reduced to the lowest 72.7% and 0% when Ni0.5SnP2O7 contained BASs was used as catalyst, the yields of 5-HMF and furfural also increased to 10.2% and 38.4%. It could be seen that the residue still maintained the basic straw shape when no catalyst was used from the SEM image of the residue (Fig. S7). However, the surface of the residue became fibrous and rough when Ni0.5SnP2O7 was used, indicated that the lignin and hemicellulose were removed and the residue mainly contained cellulose."
9,The influence of Lewis acid and hydrogenation sites,"3.5 The influence of Lewis acid and hydrogenation sites 2D HSQC NMR could detect the structural properties of lignin and products ( Fig. 5). The lignin in the corn stover mainly contains β-O-4, β-5 and β-β linkages. In addition, there were a large number of FA units in lignin. The content of β O-4 bond was obviously reduced, and the content of β5 and ββ bonds slightly decreased when Ni0.5SnP2O7 catalyst was used (Table S5). It showed that Ni0.5SnP2O7 catalyst had a good effect of broke β O-4 bond. The reason for the poor effect of broke β-5 and ββ bond was that the bond energy of the CC bond was higher than that of the CO bond. It could also be observed that the FA units were greatly reduced after Ni0.5SnP2O7 was added. In order to study the role of LASs and HSs on broken the β O-4 bond, the model compound PPPD was used as a substrate ( Table 3, Fig. S8). The mass of the catalyst was set as 50 mg by studying the influence of the mass of the catalyst on the depolymerization of PPPD (Table S6). No product was detected when no catalyst was added. 4 kinds of monomers were mainly produced, and guaiacol was the main product when the catalyst was added. The conversion of PPPD was 54.5% when Ni/C (HSs) was used, while the conversion was increased to 78.3% when SnP2O7 (LASs) was used. However, the yield of monomers reduced and a large amount of dimers were produced when SnP2O7 was used. It showed that SnP2O7 could efficiently depolymerize PPPD, but the intermediate undergoes recondensation because it couldn’t be stabilized in time. The LASs site could absorb the oxygen lone pair electron of the CO bond to promote cleavage. Therefore, it could be considered that the Sn species in SnP2O7 as LASs could play a positive role in broken the CO bonds in PPPD, but the intermediate couldn’t exist stably due to the lack of HSs. Although the lack of LASs resulted in the lowest conversion of PPPD when Ni/C was used, the timely stabilization of the HSs on the intermediates resulted in few dimers. Then a high conversion of PPPD and a high yield of monomer were achieved when Ni0.5SnOx (HSs and LASs) was used. In addition, a high conversion of PPPD was also achieved when H3PO4 was used, and only 1 and 4 were produced, but a large amount of dimmers were also produced. The highest conversion of PPPD and the highest yield of monomers were achieved when Ni0.5SnP2O7 (BASs, LASs and HSs) was used. According to our previous research, the conversion of PPPD could be divided into two pathways: reductive cleavage and acid-catalyzed cleavage (Dou et al., 2020). In the process of reductive cleavage, Sn could absorb the oxygen lone pair electrons on the β O-4 bond to promote the broken of bond, thereby produced intermediates 21, 31 and product 1. 21 and 31 would be further derived into 2 and 3, respectively (Route I) (Klein et al., 2016; Li and Song, 2020; Yang et al., 2014). Acid-catalyzed cleavage would undergo dehydration reaction to generate 41, and then hydrolyzed to 1 and 42. 42 was converted to 43 called “Hibbert’s ketones” via allylic rearrangement, and 43 was converted to 4 via reversed aldol reaction (Route IIa) (Jia et al., 2011; Sturgeon et al., 2014). Alternatively, PPPD could be converted to 44 via deprotonation of γ-hydroxyl group and the fracture of γ-carbon. After 44 was added with water, 45 was obtained, which was further subjected to reductive cleavage to form product 4 (Route IIb) (Cox et al., 2011). Reductive cleavage and acid-catalyzed cleavage should compete with each other. It should be noted that the yield of each monomer was higher when Ni0.5SnP2O7 was used than that when Ni0.5SnOx was used, indicated that the effects of reductive cleavage and acid-catalyzed cleavage were enhanced. The enhanced effects of reductive cleavage and acid-catalyzed cleavage could be attributed to the higher dispersion of Ni and the additional BASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7, respectively. However, the increase in the yield of 4 was not obvious, indicated that the BASs did not contribute much to the depolymerization of PPPD. In addition, the acid-catalyzed cleavage did not show superiority accorded to the distribution of monomers when Ni0.5SnP2O7 was used. Therefore, it could be determined that the depolymerization of PPPD was mainly caused by the LASs and HSs in Ni0.5SnP2O7. There was only acid-catalyzed cleavage occurred when H3PO4 was used, so only 1 and 4 were produced."
10,Study on the reaction process,"3.6 Study on the reaction process Based on the above results, it could be seen that the role of LASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7 was to promote the broken of CO bonds between lignin units. The role of HSs was to stabilize intermediates. The role of the BASs was to break the bond between lignin and cellulose/hemicelluloses and to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. The BASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7 might be a weak acid site, which couldn’t break the β O-4 bonds, but were sufficient to break the bonds between lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose. LASs and HSs played a major role in the depolymerization of lignin, so the effect of Ni0.5SnOx was almost the same as that of Ni0.5SnP2O7 when organosolv lignin was depolymerized (Fig. 3b). The BASs in Ni0.5SnP2O7 preferred to attack the bonds between lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose to increase the amount of lignin removed when corn stover lignin was depolymerized, and hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose simultaneously (Fig. 3a). The high yields of furfural and 5-HMF illustrated this situation. Therefore, the catalytic performance of Ni0.5SnOx and Ni0.5SnP2O7 showed a huge difference when corn stover lignin was depolymerized (Fig. 3a). If the depolymerization of lignin by Brønsted acid was to be achieved, a more strongly acidic homogeneous acid might be required. Homogeneous H3PO4 had achieved good depolymerization effects on corn stover and organosolv lignin, and achieved high selectivity of monomer G7, which was the result that NiSnP2O7 couldn’t achieve (Fig. 3, Table S2 and Table S4, Fig. 6). Ni0.5SnP2O7 was used to depolymerize corn stover lignin at different reaction times to study the selectivity of monomer. The results were shown in Fig. 7(a) and Table S7. It could be seen that the depolymerization of lignin mainly occurred in the first 3 h, and the yield of monomers increased slowly after prolonged the reaction time. So the reaction time of 3 h was the most efficient. It was worth noted that the yield of some monomers gradually increased (G1, G2, G3, S1, H1), while the yield of other monomers decreased (G4, G5, G6, G7, S2, H2, H3) (Fig. 7b). The monomer with reduced yield should be further converted, and G1, G2, G3, S1 and H1 were the final products. Mahdi et al. proposed the structure of lignin in grass (Abu-Omar et al., 2020). The G, H and S unit were connected by βO-4, ββ and β5 bonds. FA was a structure linked to arabinose, and pCA was mainly located on the branches of the main chain. At the beginning of the reaction, the H protons dissociated from the BASs on the catalyst would attack and break the bonds between lignin and cellulose/hemicellulose, thereby lead to the removal of lignin (Fig. 7c). Then the LASs on the catalyst would promote the broken of βO-4, ββ and β5 bonds and depolymerize lignin into G5, G6, H3 and S2. Finally, the hydrogenation site would hydrogenate G5, G6, H3 and S2 to generate the final products of G1, G2, G3, H1 and S1. Therefore, the entire reaction process was a synergistic effect of BASs, LASs and HSs, and none of them were indispensable. The Ni0.5SnP2O7 catalyst with the most number of BASs, LASs and the most dispersed HSs showed the best activity."
11,The stability test of the catalyst,"3.7 The stability test of the catalyst Ni0.5SnP2O7 was used to study the stability of the catalyst (Fig. S9). It could be seen that the yield of monomers remains above 30% after five consecutive reactions, but it dropped to 24.8% after the sixth reaction ( Fig. 8, Table S8). The content of Ni in these catalysts is shown in Table S9. The results of ICP showed that the content of Ni in the fresh catalyst was 6.6 wt%, while the content of Ni in the catalyst dropped to 5.2 wt% after six reactions. The TEM image of the catalyst after the sixth reaction showed that the surface of the catalyst was covered by a large amount of black blocks, which was the result of carbon deposition (Fig. S10). Therefore, the deactivation of the catalyst might be caused by element loss and carbon deposition."
12,Conclusions,"NiSnP2O7 catalyst that could remove and depolymerize lignin was prepared to realize the one-pot conversion of corn stover lignin. The BASs in the catalyst tend to remove lignin, while the LASs and HSs were mainly used for the depolymerization of lignin. The yield of monomers aromatics could be obviously increased by enhanced the removal rate of lignin in corn stover. Therefore, not only the depolymerization of lignin, but also the removal of lignin should be considered when the conversion of corn stover lignin. The efficient depolymerization of lignin was the result of the synergistic effect of BASs, LASs and HSs."
