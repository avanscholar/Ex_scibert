0,Introduction,"Bio-ethanol is an energy carrier, non-toxic, has high energy density, easy delivery and presents a relative low cost. Bio-ethanol is produced by anaerobic fermentation of biomass materials (where oxygen is insufficient for cellular respiration): e.g. sugar cane, corns, potatoes, switchgrass, or other starch-rich materials, by yeasts, converting glucose into carbon dioxide and ethanol (first generation bio-ethanol, 1G) [1]. On the other hand, as lignocellulosic biomass is a widely abundant biomass material in the world, there is an increasing interest in producing ethanol from lignocellulosics (e.g. wood residuals). Nevertheless, this process is more difficult than the anaerobic fermentation of sugar cane or starch-rich materials because of the complex molecules of lignocellulosics (which consist of cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin). In this process the cellulose and the hemi-cellulose portions are broken down by hydrolyses into sugars (by enzymes or acids); these products are then fermented into ethanol (second generation bio-ethanol, 2G) [2–3]. The principle use of bio-ethanol is as a gasoline substitute in vehicles. Reforming of bio-ethanol is a promising method for hydrogen production from renewable resources. The industrial process for hydrogen production is the Steam Reforming of Methane (SRM, Reaction (1); the principal feed-stock for this process is the methane from natural gas. In recent decades the steam reforming of ethanol process (SRE, Reaction (2)) has attracted much attention from the scientific community since bio-ethanol can be considered a renewable source (in countries like Brazil, this is produced from sugar cane). Moreover, the molecule of ethanol has more hydrogen atoms than methane and the SRE occurs at low temperatures (above 300°C). During the SRE a set of reactions occur in parallel and the mechanism involved are not completely understood yet. According to Reaction (2), SRE only produces CO2 and H2, however owing to the complexity and reactivity of the ethanol molecule, other gaseous compounds such as CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, coke (solid carbon deposited) and other liquid products are usually found in the reaction products (Reactions (3)–(11)) indicating that other reactions occur in parallel [4]: (1) CH4 +H2O→3H2 +CO (2) C2H5OH+3H2O→6H2 +3CO2 (3) C2H5OH⇆CH3CHO+H2 (4) CH3CHO⇆CO+CH4 (5) C2H5OH→C2H4 +H2O (6) C2H4 ➞2C (polymer)+2H2 (7) CO+H2O⇆CO2 +H2 (8) 2CO⇆CO2 +C (s) (9) CH4 ➞2H2 +C (s) (10) C+H2O→CO+H2 Many catalysts based on noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pt, Au, Ir) and non-noble metals (Cu, Ni, Co, Fe) have been studied for the SRE, the latter being of much interest due to economic reasons [4]. Catalysts based on cobalt and nickel have shown promising results [5], however they present problems related to carbon deposits (Reactions (6), (9) and (10)) which increase the reactor pressure; additionally the high temperature operations of SRE over these catalysts can lead to sintering of the catalytic metal. High selectivity, high conversion rates and low carbon deposition rates are desirable in SRE, and are under continuous research [6–8]. According to Urasaki et al. [9], Rh, Co and Ni are considered the most promising metals for the SRE; the Rh being the most active, but its use is limited due to its high cost. One alternative to minimize the carbon deposits during SRE is the use of excess water (in the ethanol:water molar ratio) in the inlet reactor; this excess can promote the gasification of the carbon deposits (Reaction (11)); however the production of steam water implies a significant increase of cost at the industrial level and moreover can lead to equipment corrosion, both consequences being undesirable. Another way to minimize the carbon deposits is to modify the chemical nature of the catalyst by improving the metal-support interaction or by minimizing the crystallite size of the active metallic phase or by addition of promoters. Oxides such as La2O3 [10], Al2O3 [11], ZrO2 [12], CeO2 [13], and MgO [14] are cited as promising supports for Co in the SRE. The catalytic properties of various metals including Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Pt and Rh supported on Al2O3 in the SRE at 673K were studied by Haga et al. [15]; according to these authors Co/Al2O3 was, among all mixtures tested, the most selective for H2. Zhang et al. [16] studied Co, Ir and Ni catalysts supported on CeO2 in the SRE; they reported the almost complete conversion of ethanol into CH4, CO, CO2 and H2 and affirmed that the oxygen-mobility of CeO2 favors the strong metal/support interaction and the high dispersion of the metallic phase, these effects decreased the formation of carbon deposits. The dispersion of the active phase is very important for catalytic activity, the dispersion can be influenced by the preparation method of the catalysts. In a previous work [17] we reported that the preparation of the catalysts by the polymerization method improved the catalytic activity of Ni/Y2O3–ZrO2 in the CO2-reforming methane, in comparison to the precipitation method. The polymerization method forms a homogeneous material with a fine dispersion of oxides of the catalysts (owing to the atomistic distribution of the metal cations during polymerization) [18–19]. The objectives of the present work was: a) to study the Co3O4/CeO2 catalysts containing different Co3O4 loadings, synthesized by the one-step polymerization method (our new version of the polymerization method); b) study their catalytic properties in the bio-ethanol steam reforming, and; c) conduct a comparative study between the one-step polymerization method and the impregnation method aiming to find the best catalyst for the proposed reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The catalysts were prepared by the one-step polymerization method. In this method, the polymer precursors are citric acid and ethylene-glycol which are then polymerized through poly-esterification reactions (which occurs above 120°C) around dissolved metal cations, in this case Co2+ and Ce4+. The citric acid acts as a chelating agent of these cations (forming a stable metal complex), and the ethylene-glycol is the polymerizing agent (creation connections between the chelates), the elimination of the polymer (by calcination) forms a matrix of precursor oxides [18,20]. The immobilization of these metal complexes in the former polymer reduces de segregation of particles of metal ions leading to homogenous materials [21]. In our one-step polymerization version, the precursor of cobalt (active phase) and cerium (support) were mixed together before the polymerization step. For the present report we used mixtures of the salt precursors: (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 and Co(NO3)2.6H2O, citric acid and ethylene glycol, all 99.9% pure. Briefly, the (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 and Co(NO3)2.6H2O salts were dissolved in distillated water, separately. The resulting solution was added to an aqueous solution containing the polymer precursor: citric acid in ethylene glycol (molar ratio: 3mol of citric acid per mol of Ce4+ and mass relation of 60:40 for citric acid and ethylene glycol). The resultant mixture was stirred until completely homogenized with a magnetic stirrer, then heated to 120°C and kept at this temperature for 24h, in order to obtain the polymer. The former polymer was dried at 80°C for 12h and then heated to 700°C (2°°C·min−1) in synthetic air flow for 2h. The catalysts were prepared with different cobalt contents: 5%, 10% and 20% relative to total weight of catalyst. They were named as 5CoCe, 10CoCe and 20CoCe, respectively, according to the cobalt weight percent in the mixture. For comparison purposes, a sample containing the same composition as the 20CoCe sample was synthesized, but in this case the Co was deposited via impregnation method on the catalytic support of CeO2 (CeO2 was prepared by the polymerization method). In this latter, the impregnation of cobalt was carried out using a rota-evaporator at 60°C, the resultant mixture was then dried at 80°C for 12h and calcined at 700°C for 2h at a rate of 2°C·min−1. This catalyst was named 20CoCei."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystal phases were identified with a Rigaku Multiflex X-ray diffractometer, using Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.5406Å, 40kV, 30mA) in the range 2θ=5–80°, at a scan speed of 2°·min−1. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed in a quartz tube reactor, using a multipurpose reactor, in which H2 consumption was measured with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For each measurement, 100mg of catalyst was placed in the bed-reactor and reduced with a 1.96% H2/He (v/v) gas mixture flowing at 30mL·min−1; the temperature was raised to 1000°C at a heating rate of 5°C·min−1. The specific surface area was estimated from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K), using a Quantachrome Nova 1200 equipment. In this methodology the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller method (BET) was applied to the nitrogen experimental adsorption isotherm over the relative pressure range of 0.01 to 0.20 [22]. The pore size distributions of the catalysts were determined by application of the Dubinin Radushkevich-Stoeckli equation to the experimental nitrogen adsorption isotherm [23]."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed-bed flow quartz reactor (i.d.=10mm) connected in-line to a gas chromatograph. Prior to the reaction, 150mg of the catalyst was introduced into the catalyst-bed and reduced in flowing H2 (30mL·min−1) at 700°C (10°C·min−1) for 1h, to activate the catalyst. Next, the sample was brought to the reaction temperature under pure N2 flow. The product composition was recorded over 6h of reaction time. The SRE reaction was studied at 400, 500 and 600°C. The temperature inside the reactor was measured and controlled by a thermocouple inserted into the top of the catalyst-bed. The reactions were carried out with water:ethanol feeds of molar ratio 3:1, flowing at 2.5mL·h−1, supplied by a piston pump. This alcohol mixture was vaporized in a preheating chamber at 180°C before reaching the reactor. The liquid products of the SRE, at the reactor outlet, were condensed in a cold trap. These collected liquid products were analyzed with a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph, with a flame ionization detector (FID) and FFAP capillary column (25m, internal diameter=0.2mm). All the gaseous products of the SRE were analyzed in-line with a gas chromatograph (Varian, Model 3800) with an automatic injection valve. The products at the reactor outlet were divided into two streams which were analyzed differently, in order to obtain a complete analysis of the gaseous products. In one stream, H2 and CH4 were separated in a 13× molecular sieve packed column, with nitrogen as carrier gas. In the other stream, helium was used as the carrier gas and CO2, C2H4, CH4 and CO separation were separated in Porapak-N packed columns. Both stream outlets were equipped with TCDs. The selectivity for each gaseous product was calculated by Eq. (1): (1) Selectivity for i = F i produced / F ethanol converted where Fi produced is the molar flow rate of i produced in the outlet stream of the reactor, and Fethanol converted is the molar flow rate of ethanol converted after 6h of SRE reaction, and “i” is the reaction product (H2, CO2, CH4, CO or C2H4). The carbon deposition rate was determined as the apparent gain in mass of the catalyst during the reaction. The conversion of ethanol was calculated by Eq. (2): (2) X ethanol % = Mols ethanol in − Mols ethanol out / Mols ethanol in where “Mols ethanol in” and “Mols ethanol out” means the quantity in mols of ethanol at the inlet and at the outlet of the reactor, respectively. Each SRE reaction was carried out for 6h."
5,Result and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Table 1 shows the surface area (BET) values, according to these values the pure support presented a very low surface area, however this value increased very significantly by the addition of Co3O4 by the one-step polymerization method, the highest surface area value was reached when the cobalt content rose to 20% (20CoCe). This increase is due to the contribution of highly dispersed Co3O4 on the CeO2 surface by the one-step polymerization method used [20]. On the other hand, there is a decrease in the surface area of the catalyst from 35 (pure CeO2) to 19m2·g−1 (in the sample 20CoCei) when using the impregnation method, probably owing to the Co3O4 particles that are blocking the pores in the CeO2. Fig. 1a and b shows the adsorption isotherms of N2, measured for the catalysts 20CoCe and 20CoCei, respectively. The adsorption isotherm of 20CoCe can be classified as Type IV, according to the IUPAC classification, corresponding to mesoporous solids [24]. The adsorption profile of 20CoCei can be classified as Type III, typical of macroporous or non-porous solids (probably this sample has small amount of pores), this finding is coherent with the very low surface area reported for this material. The type of the hysteresis loop of adsorption–desorption isotherm of both samples are of type H3 suggesting the presence of slit-shaped pores [25]. The adsorption capacity (volume adsorbed) of 20CoCe is greater than 20CoCei, indicating that the surface area of 20CoCe is higher than the surface area of 20CoCei, as shown in Table 1. The pore size distributions of the 20CoCe and 20CoCei samples are shown in Fig. 1c. As can be seen in this figure, the pore size distribution of 20CoCe is more uniform than the distribution found for 20CoCei. For instance the pore diameter of 20CoCe values varied slightly around 53.6Å, contrary to the 20CoCei sample which has a wider variation of pore size distribution around this value. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after the reduction process with H2 at 700°C. The average sizes of the crystallites (calculated by the Sherrer formula) and the lattice parameter of CeO2 for each sample are shown in Table 2 . Fig. 2a shows well defined peaks related to the CeO2 (2θ=28,6°; 33,11°; 47,64°; 56,47°; 59,30°; 76,86°; 79,10°; JCPDS 81-0792) with a face-centered cubic structure present in the catalysts [26]. It is noticed that the lattice parameter value of CeO2 for catalysts before reduction (Table 2) contracted after addition of cobalt (for catalysts synthesized by one-step polymerization and by impregnation method). The decrease of the lattice parameter values of CeO2 in the catalysts suggests that the cobalt ions were incorporated into the CeO2 lattice, which forms Co–O–Ce bonds. This affirmation can be supported by the fact that the gradual increase of Co content (5%, 10% and 20%) led to a gradual contraction of the CeO2 lattice parameter. According to the literature [27–28], the strong interaction between Co and Ce can improve the oxygen mobility of the CeO2 structure, which may favor the catalysis of SRE, as will be discussed later. The gradual increase of the CeO2 lattice parameter indicates that the fluorite structure of CeO2 may be favoring the entrance of the cobalt into crystal lattice of the support, in this light, the size of the interstices of CeO2 structure are larger than cobalt cations, thus allowing the internal diffusion at high temperatures (500–600°C) [26]. The XRD patterns for oxide catalysts synthesized by the one-step polymerization method (Fig. 2) show the presence of peaks related to the spinel structure of Co3O4 (2θ=31.29°; 36.94°; 44.97°; 59.22°; 65.43°; JCPDS 74-2120), these peaks became more intense for higher cobalt concentration in the catalysts. Comparing the average sizes for 20CoCe and 20CoCei catalysts shown in Table 2, it is clear that crystallite sizes for CeO2 and Co° in the 20CoCe are smaller than those in 20CoCei [29]. This can be caused by the one-step polymerization method which favored a minor agglomeration of the species (ions of Ce and Co) due to the steric hindrance exerted by the polymeric precursors over the cobalt and cerium ions, which influenced the conformation of CeO2 and Co3O4 structures during calcination of the polymer. This effect can also explain the high metallic dispersion of Co° in the catalysts obtained by polymerization as will be explained in the further paragraphs. The dispersion of cobalt (Co %D) was estimated from XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts. The formula used was D=S/dCo° (D=%) [30–33], where the dCo° is the average diameter of metallic cobalt crystallite (average size of cobalt oxide crystallite), assuming that the Co° crystallites are of spherical shape (surface density of 14.6 cobalt atom·nm−2); S is a constant equal to 96. The calculated values are shown in Table 2; and according to them the dispersion of Co° in 20CoCe (6%), 10CoCe (7%) and 5CoCe (14%) are higher than 20CoCei (3%), meaning that the polymerization method was effective for the dispersion of metallic cobalt. The tendency found in average crystallite size (Table 2) is in syntony with the results of adsorption–desorption of N2 (Table 1). For instance, from the values for average crystallite size of 20CoCe and 20CoCei catalysts, it can be affirmed that the one-step polymerization method formed smaller crystallite sizes than the impregnation method, and therefore the smaller crystallite size led to larger surface areas. The impregnation method led to a lower surface area, which can be related to the larger crystallite size, this may have led to low Co° dispersion (Table 2). Fig. 3 shows the TPR profile of CeO2 support and Co3O4/CeO2 catalysts, Table 3 shows the hydrogen consumption related to each reduction peak. The two reduction peaks related to CeO2 are well known and discussed in the literature [34–37]: the first located at 570°C is associated with a reduction of the CeO2 surface oxygen, the second at 890°C can be attributed to the reduction of bulk part of CeO2, which occurs by the removal of O2− anions from the reticulum and the formation of Ce2O3 (2CeO2 +H2 →Ce2O3 +H2O). These two peaks are present in the profiles of the support and the catalysts. Note in Table 3 that the H2 consumption for 20CoCei is lower than for sample 10CoCe, the opposite could be expected since 20CoCei has twice the cobalt content. This can be explained by the fact that not all Co3O4 content in the 20CoCei was reduced; it seems that the one-step polymerization method promoted the formation of cobalt oxide species (peaks: α, β and θ) in 5CoCe, 10CoCe and 20CoCe which are more exposed and consequently more easily reducible. Additionally the absence of θ peak and the less noticeable reduction profile of CeO2 support in the 20CoCei sample (peak around 800°C) can be clearly seen. This may have contributed to a lower H2 consumption value than for 10CoCe. A continuous increase in H2 consumption by larger addition of Co3O4 in the catalysts can be seen in the catalysts prepared in the one-step polymerization method (5CoCe, 10CoCe and 20CoCe). In general, three reduction peaks are observed (Fig. 3), named in ascending order of temperature: α, β and θ; peak α is attributed to the reduction of Cobalt III (Co3+ →Co2+) and peaks β and θ are attributed to the reduction of Cobalt II (Co2+ →Co0) [12]. The increase of cobalt content originates the increase in the θ peak, this peak is related to the cobalt oxide species in strong interaction with the CeO2 support, meaning that the higher cobalt content increased the Co/Ce interactions. This may be related to the Co–O–Ce bonds formed by incorporation of Co ions in the interstices of CeO2 crystal lattice (which led to the contraction of the CeO2 lattice parameter), as discussed in the XRD analyses. Despite the fact that 20CoCe and 20CoCei catalysts have the same cobalt content, their reduction profiles are very different (see Fig. 3), meaning that the preparation method led to the formation of different cobalt oxide species in each catalysts. The 20CoCei catalyst profile shows reduction peaks at low temperature, indicating that there were more Co3O4 in weak interaction with CeO2, probably because of agglomerate formation favored by the impregnation method [38]. On the other hand, the profile of 20CoCe catalyst (Fig. 3) shows reduction peaks at higher temperatures, probably caused by the polymerization method which may have provided a better dispersion of cobalt oxides species on the ceria support, hindering its reduction. This is in agreement with the high dispersion found in the XRD analyses of the reduced catalyst (see Table 3). The peak θ is only present in catalysts synthesized by the one-step polymerization method which is related to the Co–O–Ce bond, whose breakdown occurs at high temperature. Fig. 4a–b show the images obtained by SEM analyses of the 20CoCe and 20CoCei catalysts, respectively. The morphology of sample 20CoCe (Fig. 4a) shows the formation of a solid with grains of similar size which are uniformly repeated. Fig. 4b shows the SEM image for 20CoCei, where large aggregated particles (blocks of different sizes) can be observed distributed over almost the entire region. This analysis confirms the discussion made in the textural analysis and XRD analyses shown above, which showed that the catalysts prepared by the one-step polymerization method provided a more homogeneous material which led to cobalt finely dispersed in the support."
7,Catalytic test,"3.2 Catalytic test The average values for conversion of ethanol and water, and carbon deposition rates are shown in Table 4 . The ethanol conversion values were obtained after 6h of SRE reaction at 500°C, the selectivity to gaseous products over each catalyst are shown in Fig. 5 . The values of ethanol conversion and water are the average values for 6h of SRE reaction. After each catalytic test, liquid products were collected and analyzed; the results indicated the formation of trace amounts of: acetaldehyde (major product), acetone, ethyl ether, ethyl acetate and acetic acid. Samples prepared by the one-step polymerization method exhibited values close to 100%; the sample prepared by the impregnation method (20CoCei) reached 89% conversion of ethanol. These results show that the preparation method strongly influenced the catalytic activity, the catalysts prepared by the one-step polymerization method result in more active catalysts for SRE reaction. According to the ethanol and water conversion values (Table 4), 10CoCe and 20CoCe catalysts show the highest conversion values in the SRE, they reported the highest hydrogen and carbon dioxide selectivity values and also reported the highest water consumption values. These effects can be attributed to a good performance in the SRE (Reaction (2)) as principal reaction at 500°C, with the occurrence of the steam reforming of methane (Reaction (1)) and the water gas-shift reaction (Reaction (7)), in parallel: (1) CH4 +H2O→3H2 +CO (2) C2H5OH+3H2O→6H2 +3CO2 (7) CO+H2O⇆CO2 +H2 This finding can explain the low selectivity to CH4 over the catalysts at temperature reaction of 500°C. The above reactions may be catalyzed by the metallic cobalt active phase which is in good distribution in the 10CoCe and 20CeCe samples (as shown in Table 2). The good distribution of active sites was favored by the one-step polymerization method employed; sample 20CoCei was not good enough for the catalysis of SRE and Reaction (1), (2) and (7). Aiming to explore the reactions that occur in parallel with the SRE, catalytic tests of WGSR were carried out, separately, over the 20CoCe and 20CoCei catalysts to verify their activities in WGSR at 500°C, these results are shown in Fig. 5g. As can be in Fig. 5g, both catalysts are active for WGSR; however 20CoCe catalyst is more active than 20CoCei as the first produced a higher selectivity for CO2 (mol CO2 produced per mol of CO fed); sample 20CoCei was deactivated after 80min of reaction time, gradually decreasing its selectivity to CO2 [39]. This can explain the high selectivity to H2 and CO2 under the SRE (Fig. 5a) over the 20CoCe catalyst (when comparing with the 20CoCei, Fig. 5b), where it is observed that H2 and CO2 production is high and stable during the reaction time. Additionally, the presence of H2, CO2, CH4, CO, and traces of acetaldehyde (in liquid products) in the reaction products over all catalysts suggests that the ethanol dehydrogenation (Reactions (3) and (4)) and the steam reforming of acetaldehyde (Reaction (11)) occurred in parallel with the SRE (Reaction (2)): (3) C2H5OH⇆CH3CHO+H2 (4) CH3CHO⇆CO+CH4 (11) CH3CHO+H2O⇆CO2 +CH4 +H2 The presence of acetaldehyde on CoCe catalysts, suggests that the basicity of CeO2 (owing to their basic lattice O2− sites on surface) stabilized the adsorbed acetaldehyde. The oxygen radicals (O2−) on the surface of CeO2 can favor the dissociative adsorption of ethanol (Reaction (12)) with consequent dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (Reaction (13)); this fact can explain the formation of acetaldehyde in the CoCe catalysts [40–42]: (12) CH3CH2OH+O2− ⇆CH3CH2O− + − OH (13) CH3CH2O− + − OH⇆CH3CHO+H2 +O2− The contribution of each reaction (1)–(13)) leads to the differences in reaction products for each catalyst. The high metallic dispersion of 20CoCe catalyst (related to its small crystallite size of Co°, Table 4), and the small crystallite size of CeO2 (which led to high surface area, Table 2) may explain the low carbon deposition rate and the high ethanol and water conversion presented by this sample. In this reasoning, sample 20CoCe expresses more surface contact and therefore favors the entrance of reactant molecules into the active sites for the breakdown of the C–C bond of ethanol and O–H bond of water molecules. Fig. 5h shows the XRD diffraction patterns of the catalysts after 6h of SRE at 500°C. The diffraction peak at approximately 2θ~26° in samples 10CoCe, and 20CoCe and 20CoCei, is attributed to the presence of the graphitic carbon on these catalysts [43–44]. The 5CoCe sample did not show this peak. In addition, the peak related to the metallic cobalt in XRD patterns of samples 5CoCe, 10CoCe and 20CoCe are very weak, similar as found in the XRD patterns before reaction. This indicates that the samples prepared by the one-step polymerization method did not suffer on sintering during SRE. In the XRD profile of the 20CoCei catalyst the peak related to the metallic cobalt is more intense than its counterparts. The XRD profile of this catalyst remains constant, before and after reaction. Fig. 6a–b show SEM images for 20CoCe and 20CoCei catalysts after 6h of SRE at 500°C, respectively. Each image corresponds to a region rich in carbon (according to the EDX analysis). In these images, it can be observed that the morphology of coke deposited on both the catalysts is of a filamentous type. In the XRD analyses of the catalysts after reaction (Fig. 5h), it was observed that the 20CoCe and 20CoCei presented carbon deposits with graphitic structure. Despite both carbons are of filamentous type, the catalytic performance (selectivity to products) of the 20CoCe, 10CoCe and 20CoCei is stable during reaction time (Fig. 5), and therefore, we state that the filamentous carbon with graphitic structure did not affect the catalytic performance of these catalysts. Similarly to the reported by Vicente et al. [45] for Ni/SiO2 catalysts in the SRE, the filamentous carbon with graphitic structure can enhance the entrance of ethanol molecules to the Co° active sites (along with redispersion of Co° particles owing to the carbon fibers), therefore do not cause loss of activity. Curiously, comparing Fig. 6a and b, can be observed that the filaments of carbon are thicker in the sample 20CoCei, meaning that the preparation method notably influenced the morphology of the deposited carbon. It is known that the filamentous carbon is formed by dissolution of the carbon and its subsequent precipitation at the rear of the metal, then, is presumable that the thicker carbon filaments on 20CoCei have forced so many Co° particles off the support surface, and led to loss of active centers of Co°. This may explain why the 20CoCei catalyst deactivated after two hours of SRE. In the SRE at the reaction temperature of 500°C the formation of filamentous coke come from the methane decomposition (Reaction (9)) and/or the Boudouard reaction (Reaction (8)) [46–47]; these reactions have H2 and CO as by products, and can explain why selectivity to H2 and CO are stable during SRE over 20CoCe and 10CoCe (Fig. 5). (8) 2CO⇆CO2 +C (s) (9) CH4 ➞2H2 +C (s) Fig. 5b displays a very low selectivity to CH4 over 20CoCei catalyst, which can be attributed to an increase of CH4 decomposition by reaction (9) to form filamentous carbon, since this catalyst reported the largest Co° crystallite size (see Table 2), which allows the breakage of C–H bonds of CH4 molecules. This is in agreement with the high carbon deposition rate reported for 20CoCei (Table 4). In order to compare our best catalyst (sample 20CoCe) with other Co3O4/CeO2 catalysts reported in the current literature: Soykal et al. [13] prepared nanosized catalysts based on mixture of Co3O4/CeO2 with 10% of Co. They obtained this catalyst by incipient wetness impregnation of cobalt over the CeO2 support, the CeO2 support was synthesized by hydrothermal method. They obtained CeO2 crystallites of 8.7nm and Co3O4 crystallites of 5nm. This methodology involved two stage of calcination at 450°C (the first used to obtain the support, and the second to obtain the whole catalyst). The catalysis in the SRE was stable and reached high selectivity to H2 and the complete conversion of the ethanol at 500°C. They found that the crystallite size of the Co° and CeO2 strongly affected in the conversion of ethanol, selectivity and type of carbon deposited. The catalytic performance was good, and are similar to the found in our work, however, in our methodology for the preparation of the catalysts, our one-step polymerization method is a relatively simple method when compared to the employed by Soykal et al. [13], and moreover, we used only one stage of calcination, which may lead to lower energy costs. Chiou et al. [48] prepared CoCe catalysts with 15% of Co, and got Co° crystallites of 15nm and CeO2 crystallites of 61nm, they obtained this catalyst by deposition and precipitation method. The catalyst was stable in the SRE up 425°C, above this temperature the ethanol conversion fell due to coke deposition. In our work our best CoCe catalyst, contained 20% of Co, with Co° crystallites of 16nm and CeO2 crystallites of 11nm. The one-step polymerization method resulted favorable for the formation of very small crystallites. Our best catalyst (Sample 20CoCe) was resistant to coke deposits, even at the temperature reaction of 500°C, where the ethanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity were stable. Wang et al. [34] prepared CoCe catalysts by impregnation and precipitation methods, with Co of 10 wt.% and applied them to SRE, at similar reaction conditions of our work. They found almost complete conversion of ethanol and high selectivity to H2 and CO2. They found that coprecipitation method was better than impregnation method, because weak interaction between Co3O4 and CeO2 was favored by coprecipitation method. According to them, this weak interaction allowed the formation of more active sites of Co°. CoCe prepared by impregnation was reported lower than 20% of ethanol conversion. Despite they reported a good performance for the CoCe catalysts prepared by coprecipitation method, no detail was reported regarding to the amount of coke deposits and crystallite size of catalysts. Song et al. [49] prepared CoCe catalysts (Co of 10wt.%) by reverse microemulsion technique, and showed the formation of Co3O4 particles of a very narrow range between 6 and 7nm. The catalytic performance was superior in SRE when compared to incipient wetness impregnation method. This catalyst showed 100% ethanol conversion and a H2 yield over 90% through the SRE at 500°C. Additionally, H2 and CO2 were the main products in SRE. However no details of coke deposits were shown. In this methodology the catalysts passed through the two stages of calcination (the first one for the support preparation, and the second for the whole catalyst). Along with cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, they used hexamethyldisilazane, toluene, n-hexanol, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, during the preparation of the catalyst. The results obtained by this technique are very good and are very attractive; however, the methodology employed for the preparation of the catalyst involve several procedures and use many reactants, when compared to our one-step polymerization method (where our catalytic results and characterization are also competitive). Fig. 5e–f shows the selectivity for each gaseous product during the SRE at reaction temperatures of 400°C, and 600°C for our best catalyst, sample 20CoCe. For this sample the increase in hydrogen production with the rise of the reaction temperature is observed. The average water conversion values were 7%, 32% and 20% at 400°C, 500°C and 600°C, respectively. This trend suggests that the WGSR is strongly favored at 500°C; above 500°C the reverse of WGSR is favored, and below 500°C is presumable that the 20CoCe sample has low catalytic activity in the WGSR. At 400°C there is a very low selectivity to H2, CO and CO2, over the 20CoCe sample during the reaction time, accompanied by the highest selectivity to methane among the three temperatures studied (selectivity at 600°C≈0.1; 500°C≈0.2 and 400°C≈0.5; see Fig. 5a, e and f). This trend can be explained by the methanation reaction (reverse of Reaction (1), which is presumable favored at this temperature. The low selectivity to H2 and CO2 additionally suggest that at 400°C the WGSR was not favored, which is in agreement with the low consumption of water found at this reaction conditions. In the light of the above observations, we state that the carbon deposits at this reaction temperature comes from the Boudouard reaction (Reaction (8)), these deposits can block the actives sites of Co° [46]. All these effects can explain the low performance of the 20CoCe sample in the SRE at 400°C. At 600°C there is a significant increase in the H2 production, showing the high activity of the catalyst in the SRE, leading to low carbon deposition rates (1.9mmolC·h−1). The selectivity to the other products shows an increase of the selectivity to CO (at 400°C≈0; at 500°C≈0.15; at 600°C≈0.5) and an almost negligible selectivity to CH4 at 600°C when compared to the results obtained at 400°C and 500°C (see Fig. 5e and a). The very low selectivity to CH4 over this catalyst at 600°C can be explained by the favoring of steam reforming of methane (Reaction (1)) which increases H2 and CO in reaction products [50]. Additionally, we state that the low carbon deposits found at this reaction temperature can be related to the reverse of Boudouard reaction (reverse of Reaction (8)) where carbon deposits react with CO2 to produce CO [51]. All this observations explain the high selectivity to H2 and CO products, and the low carbon deposits reported by the SRE at 600°C."
8,Conclusions,"The one-step polymerization method produced Co3O4/CeO2 catalysts with high catalytic activity in the SRE at 500°C, the catalyst prepared by the impregnation method was not good for the catalysis of this reaction. The XRD analyses showed that the crystal lattice of the CeO2 (cubic-phase) suffered an expansion by the addition of cobalt, this expansion becomes more intense by increasing of cobalt content, showing a strong interaction between Co and Ce. The XRD, SEM and TPR analyses of the CoCe catalysts prepared by the one-step polymerization method showed that the increase of the cobalt content increases Co–O–Ce interaction, this interaction has positive effects on the catalysis of SRE. The polymerization method provides a more homogeneous material leading to finely dispersed metallic cobalt which favored the catalysis. The sample prepared by the impregnation method results in a contrary effect, which did not favor the catalysis of SRE. The best catalyst for SRE was the Co3O4/CeO2 mixture with cobalt content of 20wt.% (20CoCe catalyst), owing to its high metallic dispersion, high-surface-area, high selectivity to H2, good catalytic stability and low carbon deposition rate. This catalyst is promising for the steam reforming of bio-ethanol."
