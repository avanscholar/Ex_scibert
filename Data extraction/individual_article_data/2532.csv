0,Introduction,"Biomass feedstock valorizations are currently being explored by using heterogeneous catalysts to produce bio-based platform chemicals, fuels, and various commodity products. Furfural (F) is one of the most promising biorefinery platform molecules because it can be transformed into a wide range of value-added derivative molecules, which can be used as plasticizers, solvents, agrochemicals, monomers in the production of resins (e.g., furfuryl alcohol (FA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA)) and gasoline blends (e.g., methyl furan (MF) or terminal diols (e.g., pentanediol (PD)) [1–3]. F could be produced effectively from C-5 sugars in hemicellulosic biomasses, such as xylan, arabinose and C-6 sugars in form of glucose or fructose via acidic hydrolysis [4–6].Autor name: Interactions between metals in bimetallic catalysts can modify their surfaces, which can be beneficial for the conversion and upgrading of highly complex biomass fractions[7–9]. Copper chromite was the first industrial bimetallic catalyst for the hydrogenation of F under harsh reaction conditions (473–573K, 20–30MPa) with maximum FA yields of ca. 70% [10]. In previously published studies, several bimetallic alloy transition metal catalysts (e.g., Ni-Sn [11–13], Ni-Fe [14,15], Ni-In [16] Pd-Cu [17], and Pt-Zn [18]) have shown superior performance for the selective hydrogenation of F compared with their single metal counterpart. Delbecq et al. have suggested that an increase in the charge density of Pt metals by the addition of hyperelectronic metals or the formation of a metal alloy could enhance the affinity towards the CO bond rather than towards the CC bond to form unsaturated alcohols in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [19,20]. Moreover, unlike tin alloyed with Pt, the utilization of Ni-Sn alloy-based catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been rarely investigated to date [21]. In our previous investigations, we have reported the synthesis of both bulk and supported bimetallic Ni-Sn alloy catalysts from two types nickel precursors: first, from nickel salt (e.g., NiCl2 or NiCl2·4H2O) produced from both bulk and supported Ni-Sn alloys [11] and, second, from Raney® nickel supported on aluminium hydroxide (R-Ni/AlOH), which produced a nickel-tin alloy supported on aluminium hydroxide (Ni-Sn(x)/AlOH; x =Ni/Sn molar ratio) [12,13]. The catalysts showed high activity and selectivity during hydrogenation of F to FA [11–13], and the catalyst that consisted of the Ni3Sn2 alloy dispersed on TiO2 allowed a remarkable reduction in the reaction temperature from 453K to 383K [11]. We have also recently reported the catalytic performance of the Ni-Sn alloy during hydrogenation of biomass-derived levulinic acid in water to γ-valerolactone (GVL) [22,23]. Over bulk Ni-Sn alloy catalysts, a relatively high reaction temperature (433K, 4.0MPa H2, 6h) was applied to achieve both a high conversion and GVL yield (99%) [22]. Alternatively, a GVL yield of >99% was obtained over Ni-Sn(x)/AlOH catalysts at a lower reaction temperature (393K) compared to the bulk catalysts [23]. We found that the selectivity of Ni could be controlled precisely by changing the Ni/Sn ratio in a Ni-Sn alloy or of the dispersion of the Ni-Sn alloy on an appropriate support that might play a key role in chemoselectivity enhancement. Herein, we report our extended investigation on a facile and novel preparation method for nanosized bimetallic nickel-indium alloy catalysts supported on amorphous alumina (denoted Ni-In(x)/AA; x is Ni/In molar ratio and AA is amorphous alumina). Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts were synthesized via a very similar synthetic procedure to Ni-Sn(x)/AlOH, which has been reported elsewhere [12]. The effects of the loading amount of In and thermal treatment on the activity and selectivity of Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts during the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol were studied systematically."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Raney Ni-Al alloy (50%wt Ni and 50%wt Al) was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). NaOH, InCl3·4H2O and SnCl2·2H2O were purchased from WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., and GaCl3, AgNO3, NbCl5, and ZrCl4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Co., and used as received. Furfural, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, ethanol, and isopropanol were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industries (TCI) Ltd. and purified using standard procedures prior to use."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of R-Ni/AlOH A typical procedure for the synthesis of the Raney nickel supported on aluminium hydroxide catalyst (denoted as R-Ni/AlOH) is described as follows [12,24]: Raney Ni-Al alloy powder (2.0g) was slowly added to a dilute aqueous solution of NaOH (0.31M, 16mL) at room temperature. The temperature was raised to 363K, and 4mL of 3.1M NaOH solution was subsequently added and stirred for 30min. The mixture was then placed into a sealed Teflon autoclave reactor for hydrothermal treatment at 423K for 2h. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water until the filtrate was neutralized and then stored in water. Finally, the catalyst was dried under vacuum prior to use. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Ni-In/AlOH A typical procedure for the synthesis of the nickel-indium alloy supported on aluminium hydroxide (denoted as Ni-In(2.0)/AlOH, 2.0 is Ni/In molar ratio) consisted of first mixing R-Ni/AlOH at room temperature in an ethanol/H2O solution (∼25mL) that contained 4.5mmol InCl3·4H2O and then stirring for 2h. The mixture was placed into a sealed Teflon autoclave reactor for hydrothermal treatment at 423K for 2h. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum overnight. The Ni-In(x)/AlOH samples were reduced by hydrogen (H2) at 673K for 1.5h, which produced Ni-In(x)/AA, where AA is amorphous alumina. The Ni-In(2.0)/AlOH sample was reduced by hydrogen (H2) at 573–873K for 1.5h in order to investigate the effect of temperature reduction on the formation of the Ni-In alloy in Ni-In(2.0)/AA. The H2 uptake was determined through irreversible H2 chemisorption. After the catalyst was heated at 393K under vacuum for 30min, it was then heated at 673K under H2 for 30min. The catalysts were subsequently cooled to room temperature under vacuum for 30min. The H2 measurement was conducted at 273K, and the H2 uptake was calculated according to a method described in the literature [26,27]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded on a Mac Science M18XHF instrument using monochromatic CuKα radiation (λ=0.15418nm). The XRD equipment operated at 40kV and 200mA with a step width of 0.02° and a scan speed of 4° min−1 (α1=0.154057nm, α2=0.154433nm). Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were performed on an SPS 1800H plasma spectrometer by Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan (Ni: 221.7162nm and Sn: 189.898nm). The BET surface area (S BET) and pore volume (V p) were measured using N2 physisorption at 77K on a Belsorp Max (BEL Japan). The samples were degassed at 473K for 2h to remove physisorbed gases prior to the measurements. The amount of nitrogen adsorbed onto the samples was used to calculate the BET surface area via the BET equation. The pore volume was estimated to be the liquid volume of nitrogen at a relative pressure of approximately 0.995 according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) approach based on desorption data [25]. SEM images of the synthesized catalysts were taken on a JEOL JSM-610 microscope after the samples were coated using a JEOL JTC-1600 autofine coater. TEM images were recorded on a JEOL JEM1400 microscope. Raman spectra were collected on a JASCO NRS-2100 laser-Raman spectrophotometer with an Ar beam lamp at excitations of 488nm and 514.5nm."
5,Typical procedure for the selective hydrogenation of furfural,"2.4 Typical procedure for the selective hydrogenation of furfural The catalyst (50mg), furfural (1.1mmol), and isopropanol (3mL) as the solvent were placed into a glass reaction tube, which fit inside a stainless steel reactor. After H2 was introduced into the reactor at an initial H2 pressure of 3.0MPa at room temperature, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 383–453K. After 75min, the conversion of furfural (F) and the yields of furfuryl alcohol (FA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) were determined using GC analysis. The used Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 catalyst was easily separated using either simple centrifugation (4000rpm for 10min) or filtration, then finally dried overnight under vacuum at room temperature prior to re-usability testing."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis GC analysis of the reactant (F) and products (FA and THFA) was performed on a Shimadzu GC-8A with a flame ionization detector equipped with a silicone OV-101 packed column (length (m) =3.0; inner diameter (mm) =2.0; methylsilicone from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd.). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was performed on a Shimadzu GC–17B equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and an RT-βDEXsm capillary column. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a JNM-AL400 spectrometer at 400MHz; the samples for NMR analysis were dissolved in chloroform-d 1 with TMS as the internal standard. The products were confirmed by a comparison of their GC retention time, mass, 1H and 13C NMR spectra with those of authentic samples. The conversion of furfural, yield and selectivity of the products were calculated according to the following equations: C o n v e r s i o n : i n t r o d u c e d m o l r e a c t a n t ( F 0 ) − r e m a i n e d m o l r e a c t a n ( F t ) i n t r o d u c e d m o l r e a c t a n t ( F 0 ) x 100 % Y e i l d : m o l p r o d u c t c o n s u m e d m o l r e a c t a n t ( Δ F ) x 100 % S e l e c t i v i t y : mol product total mol products x 100 % where F0 is the introduced mol reactant (furfural, F), Ft is the remaining mol reactant, and ΔF is the consumed mol reactant (introducedmol reactant- remained mol reactant), which are all obtained from GC analysis using an internal standard technique."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization A series of bimetallic alloys (Ni-In(x)/AA, x =Ni/In molar ratio) prepared via hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of Raney® nickel supported on aluminium hydroxide (R-Ni/AlOH) [12,24] and InCl2·H2O solution in ethanol/H2O at 423K for 2h, produced the as-prepared Ni-In(x)/AlOH. After reduction of the as-prepared Ni-In(x)/AlOH with H2 treatment at 573–873K for 1.5h, Ni-In(x)/AA, x =Ni/In molar ratio and AA=amorphous alumina were produced. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . Based on the ICP-AES results, the loading amounts of In were 1.4, 2.3, 4.5, 6.2, and 9.4mmolg−1, which was reflected by the Ni/In molar ratios of 5.1, 3.1, 2.0, 1.1, and 0.8, respectively. The results also indicate that S BET increased gradually, while the H2 uptake decreased with an increase in the loading amount of In. The S BET values of the Ni-In(x)/AA samples were higher than those of the as-prepared samples (Ni-In(x)/AlOH) because of thermal treatment or the formation of amorphous alumina. In the Ni-In(2.0)/AA sample, the H2 uptake was 75μmolg−1 (entry 4), which is comparable to the previous results of the H2 uptake of Ni-Sn(1.4)/AlOH [12]. An increase in the loading amount of In reduced the surface activity of Ni, as also indicated by the H2 uptake in samples with Ni/In ratios of 1.1-0.8 (entries 5–7) and bulk Ni-In(2.0) (entry 8). The average crystallite sizes of the Ni(111) species or bimetallic Ni-In before and after H2 treatment were calculated by using the Scherer equation using the diffraction peak at 2θ=44.4° and the results are also summarized in Table 1. The findings indicate that the average crystallite sizes of Ni(111) or bimetallic Ni-In are larger than that of the as-prepared sample due to thermal treatment under hydrogen atmosphere. Compared with the bulk Ni-In(2.0) catalyst with average crystallite sizes of bimetallic Ni-In of 39.8nm (entry 8), the crystallite sizes in Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts are much smaller. The crystallite sizes of Ni or the Ni-In alloy in Ni-In(x)/AA are also consistent with the H2 uptake. These results suggest that the dispersion of active metal on amorphous alumina may influence the catalytic activity. The XRD patterns of R-Ni/AlOH and the as-prepared Ni-In(x)/AlOH with different Ni/In molar ratios are shown in Fig. 1 . R-Ni/AlOH showed sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ=44.3°, 51.6°, and 76.3°, which correspond to the Ni(111), Ni(200), and Ni(220) species, respectively (Fig. 1 a). Sharp diffraction peaks were also observed at 2θ=18.3°, 27.8°, and 40.5°, which represent bayerite, and at 2θ=18.7°, 20.4°, 36.7°, 37.8°, 53.2°, 63.9°, and 70.7°, which correspond to gibbsite (Fig. 1 a–f). In contrast, the XRD patterns of the as-prepared Ni-In(x)/AlOH exhibited broadened peaks at 2θ=44.4° due to the formation of bimetallic Ni-In, i.e., Ni2In and Ni3In2 (Fig. 1 b–f). The formation of bimetallic Ni2In3 (#JCPDS-36-1147) at 2θ=31.9° and indium oxides such as In2O3 (#JCPDS-06-416) at 2θ=22.4°, 39.4°, 51.0°, and 57.6° were also observed (Figure d–f) [24,28]. To confirm the formation of the bimetallic Ni-In alloy, the as-prepared Ni-In(x)/AlOH samples were reduced with H2 at 673K for 1.5h and resulted in the bimetallic Ni-In alloy supported on amorphous alumina (denoted as Ni-In(x)/AA) and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2 . The results indicate that controlled thermal treatment under H2 transformed the remaining aluminium hydroxides (both bayerite and gibbsite phases) into amorphous alumina, which were not detectable using XRD analysis. The diffraction peak at 2θ=44.4° that is recognized as an identical peak of the Ni(111) species became broadened and overlapped with the bimetallic Ni-In alloy phases with an increase in the loading amount of In (Fig. 2 a–e). A shoulder peak at 2θ=43.2° was also observed for a Ni/In ratio of 0.8 (where the amount of Ni >>In) that can be attributed to the formation of the bimetallic Ni3In species (#JCPDS-21-404) (Fig. 2 e). Additionally, the broadened peak of the Ni(111) species both in the as-prepared and H2-treated samples suggest the formation of a bimetallic Ni-In alloy that might have selectively occurred on the surface of Ni(111) rather than on the surface of Ni(200) or Ni(220) [29–31]. The low-frequency Raman spectrum of the as-prepared Ni-In(2.0)/AlOH resembles Ni-Sn(1.4)/AlOH, as has been previously reported [23]. It is found that the low-frequency Raman spectrum showed a 530cm−1 band, which can be attributed to the γ(OH) vibrational mode and Al-O-Al deformation, whereas the 315cm−1 band is ascribed to Al-O-Al stretching vibrations of gibbsite or bayerite (Fig. 3 ). Alternatively, the bands of Al-O-Al deformation and Al-O-Al stretching vibrations disappeared after H2 treatment at 673K for 1.5h (Fig. 3 b) due to the formation of amorphous alumina [32–34], which had been not detected by XRD [12,13]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, EDS spectra and TEM images of both Ni-In(3.1)/AA and Ni-In(2.0)/AA are shown in Figs. S1, S2, and S3 (see ESI), respectively."
9,Catalytic reactions: furfural hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic reactions: furfural hydrogenation 3.2.1 Selection of the second metals At the first stage, the catalytic performances of various transition metal modified-R-Ni/AlOH, such as Sn, In, Ga, Ag, Nb, and Zr, were first evaluated by the selective hydrogenation of the typical unsaturated aldehyde furfural (F) to furfuryl alcohol (FA), which is a promising chemical intermediate for the synthesis of biosourced products widely used in the polymer industry. Conventional Raney nickel (Raney Ni) and Raney nickel supported on aluminium hydroxide (R-Ni/AlOH) catalysts were also synthesized and evaluated using the same reaction conditions as catalyst references. The detailed information for these catalysts is summarized in Table S1 in the ESI. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared R-Ni-M/AlOH are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI. The results of the catalytic hydrogenation of F are summarized in Table 2 , and the reaction pathways are shown in Scheme 1 . Conventional Raney Ni exhibited a 99.6% conversion of F and FA and THFA yields of 48% and 51%, respectively (entry 1). As expected, by using the R-Ni/AlOH catalyst, F converted completely to produce a 99% yield of THFA (entry 2). Interestingly, the addition of Sn or In shifted the product selectivity to FA with yields of 91% and 40%, respectively (entries 3 and 4). In tin-alloyed Ni-based (Ni-Sn) catalysts, the catalytic performances have been reported previously [11–13,22,23]. Alternatively, the presence of Ga, Ag, and Nb significantly reduced the activity of R-Ni/AlOH (entries 5, 6, and 7), while Zr did not affect the activity or selectivity of the former catalyst (entry 8). Therefore, in the present report, we focused on catalytic performance studies of indium-alloyed Ni catalysts on F hydrogenation including the effect of loading amount, H2 treatment, time profiles, and catalyst reusability. 3.2.2 Effect of In loading amount The results for the selective hydrogenation of F using the as-prepared supported bimetallic Ni-In(x)/AlOH catalysts are summarized in Table 3 . It can be observed that after introducing 1.4mmol InCl3·4H2O to R-Ni/AlOH, the conversion of F drastically decreased to 47% and yielded 40% FA (entry 1). By increasing the loading amount of In to 9.4 mmolg−1, the FA yield was almost constant (entries 7 and 8, 51% and 39%, respectively). The prolonged reaction time of 180min over Ni-In(2.0)/AlOH produced a marked increase in the FA yield from 55% to 92% (entries 3 and 4, respectively). In contrast, the yield of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) decreased to 4% (entry 4). The FA yield decreased when an initial H2 pressure of 2.0MPa was applied (entry 5, 40%). The F conversion and FA yield drastically decreased without the presence of H2 (entry 6). The R-Ni-In/SiO2 catalyst (loading amount of In, 2.7mmolg−1) produced a 43% conversion and a 39% yield of FA (entry 9). Moreover, the In/AlOH, In2O3, and InCl3·4H2O catalysts (entries 10–12) and the absence of a catalyst (entry 13) did not produce hydrogenated products of F under the same conditions. In addition, screening tests using solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol, toluene, 1-propanol, and H2O) other than isopropanol (iso-PrOH) were also performed, and the results were inferior to the results with iso-PrOH, as reported previously [35]. The H2 treatment of as-prepared Ni-In(x)/AlOH at 673K for 1.5h resulted in Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts (the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2). The catalysts were evaluated for the catalytic hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural to furfuryl alcohol, and the results are summarized in Table 4 . Interestingly, over H2-treated Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts, the high conversion of F was achieved and produced a high yield of FA (entries 1–6). In Ni-In(2.0)/AA, F was converted completely into almost a 100% yield of FA. The high yield of FA without the formation of THFA, even though the reaction time was prolonged to 360min (entry 4), obviously indicated the important role of In in the Ni-In alloy catalyst system. Additionally, over the indium-modified Raney Ni supported on silica (RNi-In/SiO2 673K/H2) catalyst, the conversion of F was 96% with yield of FA that was much lower than that of Ni-In(2.0)/AA under the same reaction conditions (entry 7). The XRD patterns of this catalyst are shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI, and the physicochemical properties are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI. Moreover, by using the bulk Ni-In(2.0) catalyst (XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI), the conversion of F was only 42% under the same reaction conditions (entry 8). 3.2.3 Effect of thermal treatment on Ni-In(2.0)/AlOH catalysts Among the synthesized Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts, Ni-In(2.0)/AA demonstrated a very high activity and selectivity towards the desired product of FA. Therefore, we investigated the effect of temperature during hydrogen treatment on Ni-In(2.0)/AA at 573–873K for 1.5h, and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 4 . After H2 treatment at 573K, the diffraction peaks of the aluminium hydroxides (e.g., bayerite and gibbsite) totally disappeared, and the broadened peaks at 2θ=42-44.5° were hardly distinguished due to the overlap of the bimetallic alloy Ni-In phases and Ni metal diffraction peaks. Peak formation of NiIn (PDF#07-0178) at 2θ=30.2° and the remaining In2O3 at 2θ=22.3° and 31.9° was clearly observed (Fig. 4 a-b). The increase in temperature from 673K to 873K transformed the NiIn alloy species to Ni2In (PDF #65-3486), Ni3In (PDF#65-3522) and Ni2In3 (PDF # 65–3486) alloy phases (Fig. 4c–e), and the peaks became intensified at a temperature of 873K (Fig. 4 e). The results of the catalytic hydrogenation of F to FA and THFA over Ni-In(2.0)/AA treated with H2 at different temperature treatments are summarized in Table 5 . For Ni-In(2.0)/AA catalysts at 573K (entry 1) and 673K (entry 2), a small amount of THFA product was obtained over those catalysts (5% and 1% yield of THFA, respectively). The best catalytic performance was achieved over Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K (entry 3) and Ni-In(2.0)/AA 873K (entry 4). We also intentionally carried out the hydrogenation reaction of FA as substrate over Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K under the same reaction conditions, and only 5.2% of FA was converted into THFA with a yield of 5%, even after the reaction time was prolonged to 180min (entry 5). These results suggest that the addition of indium to R-Ni/AlOH to form the bimetallic Ni-In alloy retards the CC hydrogenation activity of nickel, and as a result, further hydrogenation of the CC furan ring in F did not proceed in the presence of the Ni-In(2.0)/AA catalyst. 3.2.4 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the catalytic hydrogenation of F to FA was evaluated over both Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 and bulk Ni-In(2.0) catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . Differences in the activity of each catalyst were clearly observed. On the bulk Ni-In(2.0) catalyst, the conversion of F gradually increased as temperature increased, and the highest conversion of F (∼76%) was achieved at 453K at the current reaction conditions. In contrast, F was converted completely at 443K over the Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 catalyst. These results are very similar to the bimetallic Ni-Sn alloy catalyst system, in which bulk Ni-Sn catalysts have much lower activity and reactivity during F hydrogenation compared with the supported Ni-Sn catalysts, as reported previously [11]. 3.2.5 Effect of initial H2 pressure The effect of the initial H2 pressure on F conversion and product selectivity was evaluated over the Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 catalyst, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . F conversion and FA selectivity gradually increased as the initial H2 pressure increased, whereas the THFA selectivity decreased smoothly to almost 0% between 2.5 and 3.0MPa and then gradually increased between 3.5–4.0MPa. 3.2.6 Kinetics The kinetics of F hydrogenation at 453K on the bulk and supported Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 alloy catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . When the bulk Ni-In(2.0) catalyst was used, FA was slowly increased to achieve a 75% yield, even after 180min. Therefore, a similar explanation can be applied to the current results as follows. The induction periods could be associated with the slow formation of oxidic tin (Snn+) from metallic tin (Sn0), as reported by Sordelli et al. (Rh-Sn) [36] and Margitfalvi et al. (Pt-Sn) [37]. Since the crystallite size or dispersion of Ni-In alloy could affect the length of the induction period, the induction period of Ni-In(2.0)/AA diminished, and a 100% F conversion (>99% FA yield) was achieved after 75min. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni-In(2.0)/AA produces a promising candidate suitable for the large-scale production of FA from the selective hydrogenation of furfural (F). 3.2.7 Re-usability test A re-usability test was performed on the Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 catalyst, and the results are summarized in Table 6 . The used Ni-In(2.0)/AA catalyst was easily separated by either simple centrifugation or filtration after the reaction. The activity of the catalyst slightly decreased, while a high selectivity was maintained for at least five consecutive runs. The amount of Ni and In that leached into the reaction solution was 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively, after four runs. The small amount of leached metal is consistent with the XRD patterns of the recovered Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 catalyst, and no obvious phase separation or agglomeration of the Ni2In nanoparticles was observed in the used Ni-In(2.0)/AA 773K/H2 catalyst, as indicated by the XRD patterns (Fig. S7 in the ESI)."
10,Conclusions,"A novel preparation method for bimetallic nickel-indium alloy catalysts supported on amorphous alumina (Ni-In(x)/AA; x =Ni/In molar ratio) catalysts has been developed and evaluated for the highly selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural. The formation of Ni-In alloy phases such as Ni3In2, Ni3In, and Ni2In in Ni-In(2.0)/AA was clearly observed after H2 treatment at 873K for 1.5h. Ni-Sn(2.0)/AA contained an Ni2In alloy as the major phase, which exhibited the best catalytic performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol exclusively and was stable for at least five consecutive reaction runs."
