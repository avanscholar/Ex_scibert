0,Introduction,"The glow discharge has been concerned as an expecting technology which has presented the chemical effects [1–3]. Liquid phase plasmas (LPP) are generated by a discharging of high voltage into liquid reactant firsthand. A high density of LPP can emit a strong UV and visible light with a many active species [4,5]. The LPP can bring to a higher density of plasma and larger spatial distribution compared to irradiation of UV lamps [6,7]. Thus, the LPP can attribute to a photochemical splitting of water for H2 production [8]. Photoelectrochemical water splitting, which integrates sunlight harvesting and water electrolysis in a single semiconductor electrode, presents an alternative solution for solar-driven hydrogen production [9]. The recent years have seen the surge in the development of multinary semiconductor materials for promising solar hydrogen generation, owing to the limitations of binary oxides [10]. TiO2 has been studied widely as a photocatalyst owing to its high photoactivity and stability. However, it is restricted to UV photocatalysis because of its large band gap [11,12]. The field of visible light water splitting photocatalyst is currently being nurtured by various kinds of conventional and new single component materials as well as composite materials [13]. Perovskites are used in part of for numerous technological applications exhibiting versatile suitable properties [14]. Perovskites are presented as the compounds of a general formula ABO3. In general, the A site is located by the larger cations, while the B site is located by the smaller cations. Perovskite materials such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, and PbZrO3 are commonly most used as piezoelectric compounds [15]. BiFeO3 thin films act multiferroic behaviors [16], while SrTiO3 perovskite has exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities [17,18]. PbBi2Nb2O9 perovskite has been used in its nanorod configuration for the fabrication of photoelectrode for a photoelectrochemical water splitting [19]. The PbBi2Nb2O9 was shown to be an efficient and stable photocatalyst for visible light water splitting, as well as for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in particulate reaction systems [20,21]. Therefore, perovskite-based photocatalysts have been concerned in the various fields of photocatalytic reaction. Some perovskite materials have been developing and they have been employing in the photocatalysis using visible light. Various strategies employed for enhancing the photocatalytic performance have been discussed, emphasizing the specific advantages and challenges offered by perovskite-based photocatalysts [14]. CaTiO3 have been attracted recently owing to its easy-preparation and its excellent stabilities and low-cost [22]. The concept of photocatalytic hydrogen generation from wastewater provides potential simultaneous solutions for clean energy generation and wastewater remediation [23]. Ethanolamine is used to eliminate sour gases (CO2 and H2S) for water alkalinization in the steam cycle of nuclear power plants to prevent the formation of scale and corrosion in the pipes of plant [24,25]. Water discharged from nuclear power plants included a high ethanolamine concentration. The ethanolamine condensed in wastewater resulted in an increase in COD and T-N when it was released to the natural water system [26]. The ethanolamine-included wastewater is recovered generally through filtration process using ion exchanging resins of the condensate polishing plants in nuclear power plants. In the refresh process of ion exchange resins, strong acidic wastewater containing ethanolamine and larger ionic substances are discharged [27]. The removal of ethanolamine naturally is difficult, and the by-products generated from the process can cause the deterioration of water, increasing the amount of organic materials or nutrient salts. The ion-exchange resins [28], oxidation [29], and biodegradation [25] have been examined to purify wastewater containing ethanolamine. Some studies have reported the biodegradation of ethanolamine in water [30–32] and soil [33–36]. These technologies, however, require a considerable quantity of chemicals, high cost, and long duration to maintain the degradation reaction. Therefore, an alternative technology is necessary for efficient purification. This paper reports ethanolamine degradation and H2 evolutions by photocatalysis using the LPP process on perovskite photocatalysts. The TiO2 and Eu-doped perovskites were used as photocatalysts. The photocatalytic potential of the photocatalysts was assessed from ethanolamine degradation and H2 production in ethanolamine-contained water. The reaction pathway based on the product distribution is discussed in terms of the photocatalytic decomposition of an ethanolamine solution."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Eu-doped CaTiO3 (CTO) was prepared according to the sol–gel method on the basis of the CaZnTiO3:Eu3+ formula. Stoichiometric amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Ca(NO3)3·4H2O, and Eu(NO3)3·6H2O were introduced as starting raw materials. Ti(OC4H9)4 was dosed to the starting material with a vigorous stirring. Citric acid dissolving in 2-methoxyethanol and alcohol solution as a chelating agent was introduced in the reactant materials. The mixtures were stirred for 2 h to obtain a highly transparent sol. The mixture was heated at 130 °C for 48 h. The sample was heated in a furnace at a 5 °C/min heating rate to a 1100 °C, and held for 5 h. The dried-materials were crushed to obtain a fine powder. Eu-doped SrAl2O4 (SAO) was synthesized by the sol–gel process. Sr(NO3)2 (Alfas Aesars, 99.9%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Alfas Aesars, 99.9%), Eu(NO3)3·5H2O (Kanto, 99.9%), and Dy(NO3)2O3·5H2O (Sigmas, 99.9%) were employed as reactants in the sol–gel method based inorganic salt. The reactants were introduced and mixed with the molar ratio of Sr:Al:Eu:Dy = 1:2:0.01:0.01. Citric acid dissolving in ethanol was dosed into the mixture as a cross-linking reagent. The mixture was stirred continuously. The solution became viscous by maintaining the solution at 80 °C for 6 h under vigorous stirring. Then the sample was dried at 130 °C for a day. The gel was sintered at 1100 °C for 6 h under condition of reducing atmospheres. The heating rate of calcination was adjusted as 10 °C/min. Commercial TiO2 (Degussa, P25) was employed as a control material."
3,Photocatalytic degradation of ethanolamine and H2 evolution,"2.2 Photocatalytic degradation of ethanolamine and H2 evolution A schematic diagram of apparatus of photodecomposition reaction adopted the LPP is presented in Fig. 1 . The photocatalytic splitting was carried out in distilled water and ethanolamine solution. The photochemical reaction was carried out in the photoreactor irradiated the LPP into reactant directly. The gaseous products were carried by nitrogen gas to gas chromatograph (GC, Younglins, M670S). The N2 carrier gas is supplied at 20 cc/min constantly. Temperature of inside of the reactor installed the LPP system was controlled at 25 °C by circulating of water maintained constant temperature. The gas phase products were analyzed by gas chromatography installed a thermal conductivity detector with molecular sieve 5A packing column. The liquid products and remaining acetic acid were also analyzed by GC (Shimadzu, 8A) using a FID analyzer and HP-1 capillary column, 50 m length. Liquid phase plasma was generated by pulsed electric discharging system using a needle to needle type electrode. Tungsten was introduced as the material of the needle electrode. Inter electrode gap was 0.3 mm. The LPP pulse width and frequency of the electric discharge supply are 3–5 μs and 25–30 kHz, respectively."
4,Characterization of perovskites and optical analysis,"2.3 Characterization of perovskites and optical analysis The crystallinity and structure of the perovskite photocatalysts were examined by a high resolutions X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigakku model Dmax-II/PS) using Ni filtered CuKα X-ray radiations (λ = 1.5405 Å). The morphologies and microstructures of the perovskites were measured by a scanning electron microscopes (SEM, Hitachii, S-4810). Fluorescence spectrum was recorded using fluorescence spectrophotometers (Horiba, Fluoromax-4). The chemical components of the perovskites were measured using an energy dispersive X-rays spectroscopy (EDX, NORANE Z-MAXI 350). UV–visible diffuse reflectances spectra (DRS) were estimated by a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadtzu, UV-2500) in the 200–1000 nm wavelength using BaSO4 a reflectance standard. The optical bandgap (E gap) was determined from Kubelka and Münk theory. Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured on a JASCOS FT-IR-500 plus spectrometer. The samples were diluted (10%) in KBr and scanned in a frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1 at room temperature. The optical emissions spectra (OES) to LPP irradiation were estimated during the electrical discharging in the reactants (pure water and aqueous ethanolamine solution) using the fibers optical spectrometer (Avantesi, AvaSpec-3650). The spectra were recorded using optical fibers coming out perpendicularly to the axis of the electrode. The measuring conditions in acquisition of the spectra were a 240 V of discharge voltage, 32 kHz of frequency, and 4 μs of pulse width."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characteristics of photocatalysts and optical emission.,"3.1 Characteristics of photocatalysts and optical emission. XRD patterns of the CTO and SAO perovskites are shown in Fig. 2 . Reference XRD data of CTO and SAO perovskites were included in the figure to compare with those of the synthesized perovskites. In comparison of the XRD pattern with reference, the positions and intensities of the primary peaks were well corresponded with data of JCPDS card (No. 22-0153) in Fig. 2(a), It is indexed to orthorhombic CaTiO3. Zn2TiO4 and Ca2ZnTi15O36 peaks, but their intensities were very weak. The intensities of the primary phases of CaTiO3 were not influenced. Fig. 2(b) shows the XRD pattern of the SAO perovskite. The intensities and positions of primary peaks of the SAO were accorded entirely to the data of reference card (JCPDS No 34-0379). This indicates that the material was consisted of SrAl2O4 phase. The weak peaks of SrAl4O7 and Sr3Al2O6 were presented on the particle surface, but their intensities were negligibly weak. According to the XRD phase analysis in Fig. 2(b), the small amount of doped rare earth ions (Eu2+ and Dy3+) have virtually no effect on the SrAl2O4 phase composition. The reason was that SrAl2O4 hosts belong to stuffed tridymite structure, where Sr2+ occupies interstitial site in an open frame work of AlO4 tetrahedral. The ionic radii of Eu2+ (0.127 nm) is roughly equivalent to that of Eu2+ (0.130 nm), so that Eu2+ ionic can easily substitute for Sr2+ sites and have no effect on the SrAl2O4 phase composition [37]. Representative EDX spectra of the CTO and SAO perovskites are presented in Fig. 3 . The EDX spectrum of the CTO exhibits the peaks related to elements of Ca, Zn, and Ti. Eu element was observed as a small peak at 6 keV because the content contained in the compound was too small. The result was well corresponded with that in reference [38]. The effective radii of Ca2+, Ti4+, and Eu3+ ions in octahedral site are 1.00, 0.605, and 0.947 A, respectively [39]. This suggests that the Eu3+ ion can be substituted for the Ca2+ ion easily than for the Ti4+ ion in CaTiO3:Eu3+ lattice, because the ionic radii of Ca2+ and Eu3+ ions are closer. In addition, it has suggested a simulated orthorhombic lattices of CaTiO3:Eu3+, which represented the substitutions of Eu3+ ion for Ca2+ ion in octahedral site [40]. Fig. 3(b) presents EDX spectrum of the Eu-doped SAO perovskite. The elements peaks of Sr and Al were observed in the results in SAO. The intensities of the Sr and Al peaks in SAO were strong, but Eu peak was not observed because the containing amount of Eu was too small. The surface morphologies of CTO and SAO perovskites observed by SEM images are shown in Fig. 4 . Particles of two perovskites are submicron-sized crystallines, which exist with conglomerations among the crystallines due to high sintering temperatures. The shape of the perovskites was conglomerated like as irregular cubic. The small crystallines were incorporated onto aggregated crystallines. The grains were spherical polyhedron sized ca. 3 μm. Fig. 4(b) presents SEM images of the SAO perovskite. The SAO was also polycrystallines, and the crystallines were sintered into irregular shapes owing to the high sintering temperature. The morphology of SAO crystallines were flower-like shape and dispersed onto conglomerated large crystals. The size of flower-like crystallines was ca. 2 nm. Fig. 5 presents FT-IR spectra of the CTO and SAO perovskites. Structure of SAO was a distorted tridymite structures. The tridymite is one of the nephelines of structure consisting of corner-shared tetrahedral frameworks that distorts to generate large cation-locating cavities. In SAO, the frameworks are constructed by AlO4 tetrahedra and the structure of channels are located by Sr2+ ion [41]. The AlO4 molecules could have four degenerated normal modes of vibration: Symmetric stretchings (γs), symmetric bendings (δs), antisymmetric stretchings (γas), and antisymmetric bendings (δd) [42]. The bonding structures of the CTO and FT-IR spectrum were recorded at 400–4000 cm−1 of the CTO. The broad band at 2900–3700 cm−1 with the peak of 3423 cm−1 is the characteristic stretching vibrations of hydroxylate (OH) attributable to water and the bending band is observed at 1650 cm−1. The peak located at 877 cm−1 is related to the symmetric stretching vibrations along CaOCa bonds. The band at 1439 cm−1 is assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of the hydroxylate (OHCa). The band at 560 cm−1 is concerned with the vibration of the CaO bond of the CTO. A broad and strong band, characteristic of alkaline titanates, appears at 460 cm−1. The band at 421 cm−1 is related to the asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the Ti-O. Fig. 6 presents the photoluminescent emissions spectra of CTO and SAO perovskites. The perovskites exhibit a strong luminescence under UV excitation. The CTO shows the emission intensity at 616 nm. The SAO perovskite exhibited a high emission peak centered at 510 nm through an excitation of 270 nm. The intensity of the peaks for the SAO was related to the typical 4f65d1 → 4f7 transitions of the Eu2+ ion in SAO. This influenced the nature of the Eu2+ surroundings, where the shielding functions of the electrons in the inner shells split the mixed state of 4f and 5d by the crystal fields [43]. A special emission of Eu3+ ion was not defined in the spectrum. The Eu3+ ion in the precursor was reduced to Eu2+ ion in a condition of a weak reducing atmosphere. The Eu2+ ion in the precursor was reduced to Eu+ ion. Simultaneously, local vibration in the lattice structure and thermal vibration of the surrounding ions were resulted in the luminescence spectra with broad band [44]. Fig. 7 illustrates the DRS results of the photocatalysts converted as Kubelka-Münk units. The optical property of the photocatalysts was arisen from a light adsorption in the photoreaction process. The absorption edge of TiO2 revealed at ca. 380 nm in the spectrum. Whereas, the spectra of perovskites appeared at upper region. Regarding Eu doping on the perovskites, the absorption ranges were enlarged to the visible light range. The bandgaps of the TiO2 and Eu-doped perovskite photocatalysts were 3.2 eV and 3.0 eV, respectively. The optical emission spectra of LPP estimated during discharging in a distilled water and ethanolamine solution are presented in Fig. 8 . Strong emission curves such as O1 at 777 nm, Hα at 656 nm, and Hβ at 486 nm appeared in the distilled water. In addition, the molecular band of OH radicals was observed at 309 nm. The strongest emission peak appeared at 309 nm. Another strong emission peak revealed at 656 nm in the visible region. This indicates that the irradiation of LPP can lead to a photoreaction in both ultraviolet and visible regions. The strength of emission spectrum at 309 nm was slightly enhanced due to dose of ethanolamine into water."
7,Photocatalytic degradation of ethanolamine and hydrogen evolution,"3.2 Photocatalytic degradation of ethanolamine and hydrogen evolution Fig. 9 (a) presents the variations in ethanolamine concentration by degradation with different initial concentrations of ethanolamine on the TiO2 photocatalyst. The ethanolamine concentrations decreased due to photocatalytic decomposition of ethanolamine by LPP irradiation. Ethanolamine degradation was faster at lower initial concentration of ethanolamine than at higher initial concentration because the photo-efficiency increased with decreasing concentration. In addition, a large amount of ethanolamine would be adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface, which can hinder the ethanolamine molecules from coming in contact with the free radicals and electron holes. Fig. 9(b) presents H2 evolution by LPP irradiation in various initial concentration of ethanolamine in water over TiO2 photocatalyst. Hydrogen was generated with degradation of ethanolamine in the photoreaction system, simultaneously. Rate of H2 evolution in ethanolamine solution was higher than that in pure water. Rate of H2 evolution became higher with increasing ethanolamine concentration in water. The rate in ethanolamine-contained water was larger than that in pure water on TiO2. Fig. 10 (a) presents the photocatalytic degradations of ethanolamine on TiO2, SAO and CTO at the same initial concentration of ethanolamine. The degradations of ethanolamine were faster on the perovskites than that with the TiO2 photocatalyst. This suggests that the perovskites have higher photocatalytic activity than the TiO2 photocatalyst. The higher photocatalytic activity of the CTO perovskite was arisen from its higher photosensitivity, which was defined in the DRS data. The CTO photocatalyst has a lower bandgap than TiO2. Fig. 10(b) shows rate of H2 evolution by LPP irradiation in various photocatalysts in ethanolamine-contained water over TiO2 photocatalyst. Hydrogen was also generated with degradation of ethanolamine in the photoreaction system, simultaneously. The amount of H2 generation was larger on the perovskites than that with the TiO2 photocatalyst. The CTO perovskite exhibited the highest rate of H2 evolution. The higher photocatalytic activity of the CTO photocatalyst was attributed to its higher photosensitivity. Fig. 11 shows kinetic plots for EA degradation with different concentration on various photocatalysts. The rate of EA degradation was proved as 2nd order reaction from their kinetic analysis. Rate constants determined from the kinetic analysis were summarized in Table 1 . The rate constants were increased in lower initial concentration of EA on TiO2 photocatalyst. The highest rate constant exhibited on CTO photocatalyst in the condition of 10 mg/L initial concentration of EA. This indicates that the CTO photocatalyst presents a higher photocatalytic activity than that of TiO2. It would be derived from its lower bandgap energy. The components of the gaseous and liquid products were analyzed by GC to identify the pathways of photochemical reaction of ethanolamine degradation and H2 evolution. In the gaseous products, H2 was observed along with a small amount of carbon monoxide but no oxygen was found. A small amount of formaldehyde and acetic acid were detected as new liquid products in the photocatalytic reaction of the ethanolamine-containing water. From these results, the typical pathways of photochemical reaction to the ethanolamine-containing water can be estimated, as shown in the following reaction equations: (1) H2O → H2 + ½O2 (2) C2H7NO + H2O → C2H4O + NH4 − + H2O (3) 2C2H4O + H2O → C2H6O + CH3COOH The reaction from Eqs. (1) to (3) illustrates the typical photo-decomposition of ethanolamine-contained water as the primary reactions. Eq. (1) outlines the catalytic decomposition of water producing H2 gas. The ethanolamine in solution might be decomposed to ethanol and acetic acid, as shown in Eq. (3). In addition, consecutive reactions might be taken place as the following reaction equations (4) 2C2H6O + O2 → CH3OH + HCHO (5) CH3OH → HCHO + H2 (6) HCHO → CO + H2 (7) CH3COOH → 2CO + 2H2 Ethanol could be decomposed to methanol and formaldehyde, as shown in Eq. (4). The methanol might have decomposed to formaldehyde and hydrogen. CO gas are generated in the photocatalytic reaction from the process of ethanolamine decomposition. NH4 − ions might be solved in water. An additional H2 evolution can occur from the decomposition of formaldehyde, methanol or acetic acid, as shown in Eqs. (5)–(7). Therefore, H2 evolution can be attributed to the photocatalytic decomposition of water. Therefore, the rate of H2 evolution was higher than that of the photocatalysts of pure water. On the other hand, the increase in H2 evolution was not so high because the concentration of ethanolamine in water was low. Fig. 12 presents a schematic diagram of photocatalytic process of aqueous ethanolamine solution under LPP irradiation. The fundamental photocatalytic water splitting on the photocatalysts involves multiple steps, including light absorption by the photocatalyst, photoexcitation of charge carriers (electron-hole pairs), separation of excited charges, migration of charge carriers to the photocatalyst surface, the transfer of charge carriers to water or other molecules, and surface reaction for H2 or O2 formation as shown in Fig. 12. Ethanolamine would decompose into NH4 −, CO, and H2 gas, ultimately."
8,Conclusion,Liquid phase plasma process was adopted in purification of wastewater and production of hydrogen. Ethanolamine was degraded by photocatalytic decomposition using the liquid phase plasma on the perovskite photocatalysts. The photocatalytic decomposition of ethanolamine-contained water led to the degradation of ethanolamine and H2 evolution. The degradation of ethanolamine and H2 evolution were improved with the CTO and SAO perovskite photocatalysts. The rate of H2 evolution in ethanolamine-containing water became higher than that in pure water. This suggests that H2 evolution is accelerated from additional H2 evolution by the photo-decomposition of ethanolamine in water.
