0,Introduction,"Many pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid hormones, and immunosuppressive agents, have been widely applied to treat human illnesses, animal breeding, agriculture, and aquaculture (Chen et al., 2021b; Lee et al., 2017). The urine from organisms is an important medium for pharmaceuticals or their metabolites. Previous studies have demonstrated that approximately 30–90% of typical pharmaceuticals are excreted in urine and feces as either the parent drugs or active metabolites (Zhou et al., 2021). Lienert et al. (2007) analyzed the excretion pathway of over one thousand active ingredients from 212 drugs, showing that approximately two-thirds of them appeared in urine. Meanwhile, urine contains the majority of the plant-essential nutrients of human excreta and has been used in agriculture since ancient times, particularly in various parts of Asia (Simha et al., 2021). To recycle nutrients and achieve sustainability, humans have attempted to find profitable and ecologically beneficial ways to utilize the useful components of urine (van der Kooij et al., 2020). Utilizing human urine as a liquid fertilizer to grow crops and increase plant health is an effective method of nutrient recycling to support agricultural production. It can also reduce the pollutant load of influents in wastewater treatment plants (Masrura et al., 2020); however, applying organic fertilizer containing urine inevitably poses serious ecological risks to soil or receiving water because of the presence of pharmaceutical residues in urine (Ahadi et al., 2020). Therefore, these pollutants must be removed before manure can be reused or applied. Many techniques have been applied to remove pharmaceutical pollutants from urine, including membrane separation (Pronk et al. 2006a, 2006b), oxidation or ozonation (Fang et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2018), and adsorption (Gao et al., 2020; Paredes-Laverde et al., 2019; Solanki and Boyer, 2017). Among these, adsorption methods have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency, easy operation, and lack of secondary pollution (Landry and Boyer, 2013). Solanki and Boyer (2019) reported that the adsorption capacities of cork biochar for paracetamol in fresh and hydrolyzed urine were 27.27 mg/g and 41.39 mg/g, respectively. The adsorbents showed different selectivities for contaminants in fresh and hydrolyzed urine. Paredes-Laverde et al. (2018) used biochar to adsorb norfloxacin from distilled water, domestic sewage, and simulated urine, and the removal efficiencies were 99.66%, 95.63%, and 83.54%, respectively. The pharmaceutical removal capability of adsorption processes is greatly restricted due to the complex composition of urine. Furthermore, the reusability of adsorbents is an important limitation for pharmaceutical adsorption technology for industrial applications. In practical applications, the pore size and structure of an adsorbent are crucial factors affecting its adsorption efficiency and other characteristics. Mesoporous carbon has a broad pore size range of 2–50 nm, which is essential for improving molecular transport in a porous network and promoting the adsorption of macromolecules (Ji et al., 2010). Many different carbon precursors have been used to prepare mesoporous carbon, such as sucrose, furfuryl alcohol, naphthalene, anthracene, aniline, and phenolic resins. Furfuryl alcohol, which contains two benzene rings and a carboxyl group, works well as a solvent and is recognized as a promising carbon precursor due to its high carbon yield, easily dispersal in pore-forming agents, and easy conversion to a continuous spatially-uniform carbon network (Niebrzydowska et al., 2013; Zhai et al., 2008). Previous studies have developed various hard and soft template methods to prepare mesoporous carbon, but few have investigated the removal of pharmaceuticals from urine using mesoporous carbon (Deng et al., 2011; Zhu and Diao, 2011). Oxytetracycline (OTC) and diclofenac (DCF) are frequently detected in both urine and aquatic environments. The two pharmaceuticals have bactericidal activity and anti-inflammatory properties, and they have been widely used to treat infectious diseases, inflammation, and pain (Harja and Ciobanu, 2018; Solaun et al., 2021). In this study, furfuryl alcohol-derived mesoporous carbon (FMC) was synthesized and tested as an adsorbent to remove these two common pharmaceuticals from synthetic urine. The adsorbents were characterized in terms of their surface, structural, physicochemical, and morphological properties. The pharmaceuticals’ adsorption properties, influencing factors, and inert characteristics of nutrient reduction during adsorption were investigated to understand the adsorption mechanism and pollutant removal from synthetic urine."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The reagents used in the experiments were analytically pure and non-purified. Diclofenac sodium (99%) and oxytetracycline hydrochloride (95%) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Pluronic F127 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Furfuryl alcohol, oxalic acid, urea, ammonium hydroxide, magnesium chloride, and other chemicals were obtained from Chongqing Chuandong Chemical Co., Ltd. and Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Factory. High-purity nitrogen (99.99%) was purchased from Chongqing Rico Gas Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of mesoporous carbon,"2.2 Synthesis of mesoporous carbon The mesoporous silica particles as the hard template were prepared based on previous work (Wang et al., 2020), and the process is described in the Supplementary Material. Furfuryl alcohol-derived mesoporous carbon (FMC) was synthesized by the following steps. Furfuryl alcohol (carbon source) and oxalic acid (catalyst) were dissolved in ethyl alcohol. Then, the prepared mesoporous silica was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was agitated. After that, the mixture was heated in an oven at 100 °C for 8 h before calcination at 350 °C for 6 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. All of the obtained materials were finely ground, then the above steps (carbon source filling and calcining) were repeated once. In this process, furfuryl alcohol was added to mesoporous silica in a mass ratio of 5: 4. Finally, the obtained solid powder was carbonized under a nitrogen atmosphere at 900 °C for 6 h. After the template was removed by immersion in 0.5 M NaOH solution at 90 °C, the resulting black powder was cleaned with deionized water to obtain FMC."
4,Fresh and hydrolyzed synthetic urine,"2.3 Fresh and hydrolyzed synthetic urine The characteristics of human urine may change significantly due to diet or other physiological factors; therefore, to ensure consistency and avoid pharmaceutical contamination, synthetic urine was used during experiments. Two types of synthetic urine were used: fresh urine and hydrolyzed urine. The components in the formulation represent the main properties of urine, and the compositions of the synthetic urine are shown in Table S1 (Sun et al., 2018)."
5,Characterization of mesoporous carbon,"2.4 Characterization of mesoporous carbon The surface morphology and internal structure of materials were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss, Germany) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30, FEI). The surface area and pore size distribution were measured using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Micromeritics TriStarII3020, USA). Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Axs, Germany). Raman spectroscopy (inVia reflex, Renishaw) was used to characterize the graphitic character of mesoporous carbon. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed using an IRPrestige-21 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The zero point charge (pHpzc) was analyzed using the well-known salt addition method (Paunovic et al., 2019)."
6,Adsorption experiments,"2.5 Adsorption experiments All experiments were performed at 298 K unless otherwise stated. Typically, 10 mg of FMC was added to 80 mL of pollutant solutions in conical flasks (the initial concentrations of DCF and OTC were 30 and 40 mg/L, respectively). The containers were sealed with plastic wrap and immediately placed into a thermostatic water bath oscillator (210 rpm) for different times to allow samples to reach adsorption equilibrium to investigate the adsorption kinetics. Adsorption isotherm investigations and thermodynamic experiments were carried out at initial pharmaceutical concentrations of 20–100 mg/L at 288, 298, and 308 K. To test the influence of major urine components and pH on adsorption, individual chemicals (ammonia, urea, sodium chloride, citrate, and bicarbonate) were added to deionized water, and the pH was adjusted using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. To maintain consistency, the concentrations of components and solutions pH were the same as those in synthetic urine samples. The solutions were filtered after reaching adsorption equilibrium, and then the residual pharmaceutical concentrations were analyzed. To investigate the regeneration and reusability of the FMC for pharmaceutical adsorption, the adsorbent was utilized 5 times to adsorb the target pollutants in the repeated batch experiments. The FMC loaded with pollutants was regenerated by adding the saturated adsorbent to an ethyl alcohol solution (ethanol and water = 1:1 wt%) for 2 h on a shaker table at 210 rpm. Then, the adsorbent was obtained for further usage after washing and drying. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.22-μm filter membrane, and the pharmaceuticals were analyzed by a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The total nitrogen (TN) and phosphate (PO4–P) were analyzed by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion-UV spectrophotometric method and the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method, respectively. Adsorption experiments were carried out in triplicate to calculate the average values. The adsorption efficiency (R, %) and adsorption capacity (q e, mg/g) were obtained by the following equations (1) and (2): (1) R = C 0 − C t C 0 × 100 % (2) q e = C 0 − C t m × V where C 0 is the concentration of a pharmaceutical at t = 0, C t is the concentration of a pharmaceutical at time t (mg/L), m is the mass of FMC (g), and V is the pharmaceutical volume (L)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of mesoporous carbon,"3.1 Characterization of mesoporous carbon 3.1.1 SEM and TEM SEM analysis results show that FMC had a rough surface with large pores in Figs. S1(a and b). The rough surface may provide abundant adsorption sites for contaminants. Samples were visualized using TEM, and many well-developed, pronounced, and worm-like pores were observed (Fig. S1 (c)). The lighter colors in the picture represent channel pores, and the darker colors represent the carbon wall after template removal. The high-resolution TEM picture of the interior structure of the FMC revealed typical fringes of a graphite lattice in Fig. S1 (d), which was well-recognized as the feature with high adsorption ability via π-π interactions with the phenyl cycle of pharmaceutical molecules (Wu et al., 2020). 3.1.2 XRD and Raman spectroscopy The wide-angle XRD pattern of the FMC in Fig. S2 (a) showed peaks at 2θ values of 22°, 43°, and 79°, which correspond to the (002), (100), and (110) planes of graphite, respectively. The results show that the FMC is an amorphous carbonaceous adsorbent with disordered carbon rings. The diffraction peak at 22° is due to the stacking of carbon atoms in the graphite layer, and the broad peaks indicate the degree of graphitization and crystallinity of the carbon sample (Lei et al., 2008). No diffraction peaks of carbon were observed, indicating that the carbon was amorphous. In the Raman spectrum (Fig. S2 (b)), the D peak at 1346 cm−1 can be attributed to defects such as disordered carbon atom vibrations or edge defect vibrations, and the G peak at 1599 cm−1 reflects the degree of order of sp 2-carbon (Lei et al., 2008). The defects of carbon materials and graphitic structures can be evaluated via the ratio of the intensities of the D peak and G peak in the Raman spectrum (I D/I G)—a lower I D/I G reflects a higher level of graphitization. For FMC, I D/I G = 0.94, which indicates the existence of some structural defects and semi-crystalline graphitic layers (Cheng et al., 2020). The π-electron density increased and many electron-hole pairs were generated in graphite, giving FMC a strong affinity for organic pollutants via π-π EDA interactions (Hai Nguyen et al., 2020). 3.1.3 BET and FT-IR As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of FMC is a type IV isotherm with a type H2 hysteresis, suggesting that FMC contains mostly mesopores in the IUPAC classification (Li et al., 2019). The corresponding specific surface area and pore volume of the FMC were approximately 1022.61 m2/g and 1.71 cm3/g, respectively. The mesopore volume was 1.69 cm3/g, accounting for 98.8% of the total pore volume. Furthermore, the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda model indicated that the average pore size of the prepared FMC was about 6.7 nm. Two peaks (4.3 nm and 25 nm) were present in the differential curve of the FMC pore size distribution, which corresponded to two different pore types. Because the carbon source was randomly concentrated in the template, some channels were completely filled, while others remained partially empty, resulting in two different pore types (Janus et al., 2020). The functional groups detected by FT-IR are shown in Fig. 1 (b). The absorption peak positions of FMC remained essentially unchanged before and after adsorption, which indicates that the structure of the adsorbent was not destroyed. The broad stretching band at 3443 cm−1 was related to the O–H stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups, which may enhance the adsorbent's ability to donate electrons (Liu et al., 2021). The stretching vibration peaks at 1597 cm−1 and 1678 cm−1 indicate the presence of C–C (aromatic) and CO, respectively (Hiew et al., 2019). The bands at 1032–1391 cm−1 were attributed to C–O bending vibrations in alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids (Wang and Yang, 2021). After adsorption, the broad peaks at 3782 cm−1, 3443 cm−1, 1597 cm−1, and 1391 cm−1 were strengthened, and their positions slightly changed, indicating that interactions occurred between pollutants and functional groups. The hydroxyl-group peak (3443 cm−1) showed a slight shift and obvious peak strength changes of aromatic C–C (1597 cm−1) after adsorption, which also implied the presence of π-π interaction in the conjugated benzene regions of the contaminants and the FMC (Dai et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). The CO peak at 1678 cm−1 shifted to a higher wavenumber after adsorption, indicating hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent and pollutants (Hao et al., 2021)."
9,Adsorption kinetics,"3.2 Adsorption kinetics The influence of reaction time on the removal efficiency at various initial DCF and OTC concentrations is shown in Fig. 2 (a–d). Adsorption occurred rapidly during the first 15 min for both pharmaceuticals, but after that, the adsorption rate slowed down. When the initial contaminant concentration in fresh urine was 20 mg/L, around 95.2% of DCF and 92.6% of OTC were adsorbed by the FMC in 15 min. Such a high removal rate could be attributed to the high specific surface area and suitable pore size of the FMC, which provided greater access to the adsorbent surface to pharmaceutical molecules (Sun et al., 2012). After this time, the adsorption capacity increased more slowly and reached adsorption equilibrium within approximately 2 h. When the initial concentration was 50 mg/L, the equilibrium adsorption efficiencies of DCF and OTC were 92.3% and 93.4% in fresh urine, and 79.0% and 88.0% for hydrolyzed urine, respectively. The adsorption kinetics were evaluated using the pseudo-first-order dynamic model, the pseudo-second-order dynamic model, and the intra-particle diffusion model. The dynamic parameters and methodology are described in the Supplementary Material. Table S2 and Table S3 list the calculated dynamic results and correlation coefficients (R 2). The results indicate that the pseudo-second-order model showed a good correlation (R 2 ≥ 0.995). In addition, the equilibrium adsorption capacity (q e, exp ) was closer to the fitted adsorption capacity (q e, cal ) using the pseudo-second-order kinetic model; thus, the removal process involves the transfer and sharing of electrons between the FMC and contaminants (Chen et al., 2021b). The high correlation of the pseudo-second-order equation with the kinetic data is consistent with reported results (Ramanayaka et al., 2020; Solanki and Boyer, 2019). From Table S2, it can be found that the value of the kinetic rate constant (k 2 ) decreased upon increasing the initial concentration of pharmaceuticals. This phenomenon was because there was less competition for surface adsorption sites at lower pollutant concentrations (Paredes-Laverde et al., 2018). Hence, the adsorption of the two pharmaceuticals onto the FMC proceeds via chemical adsorption, whose rate was controlled by the number of adsorption sites. The intra-particle diffusion model should be applied for porous adsorbents because it considers the process of a target contaminant diffusing into an adsorbent's pores. The results showed that adsorption proceeds via three stages. The first stage is the fast adsorption of pharmaceuticals on the external surface of the adsorbent. Intra-particle diffusion is the second step, in which the pollutant diffuses to the internal sites of the adsorbent through pore diffusion or solid-surface diffusion. The third stage was caused by the adsorption of contaminants to overcome the diffusion resistance in FMC, which finally reached adsorption equilibrium (Paredes-Laverde et al., 2019). The linear curve did not cross the origin, so intra-particle diffusion is not the only rate-controlling step for the adsorption of DCF or OTC by FMC; therefore, boundary layer control might be involved in adsorption."
10,Adsorption isotherms,"3.3 Adsorption isotherms The equilibrium data were fitted using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips isotherm models, whose calculation formulas are given in the Supplementary Material. As shown in Fig. 3 , plots of the adsorption isotherms were fitted by the three models, and Table S4 lists the calculated results. The Langmuir model represents monolayer adsorption, the Freundlich isotherm represents heterogeneous surface adsorption, and the Sips isotherm is a mixture of the Langmuir and Freundlich models (Gao et al., 2020). The Langmuir model described the adsorption process better than the Freundlich model. Both the Sips (R 2 ≥ 0.995) and Langmuir models (R 2 ≥ 0.993) provided good fits to the FMC isotherm data, which shows that both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption occurred (Xue et al., 2021). The mechanism of DCF and OTC adsorption is more complicated than an ideal monolayer process (He et al., 2015). Monolayer adsorption may have occurred via strong bonding between the adsorbent and pollutants, and a multilayer may have formed due to weak bonds between adsorbed molecules (Ramanayaka et al., 2020). All R L values were between 0 and 1 during DCF and OTC adsorption, indicating that adsorption was favorable. Favorable adsorption was also indicated because the Freundlich constant n was greater than 1 (Hu et al., 2019). The theoretical maximum adsorption capacities for DCF and OTC according to the Langmuir model were 411.8 mg/g and 465.9 mg/g in fresh urine, and 337.8 mg/g and 386.9 mg/g in hydrolyzed urine, respectively. Overall, the FMC showed excellent adsorption performance for DCF and OTC compared with other reported adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacity of sugar-derived mesoporous carbon was 241 mg/g for DCF (Olchowski et al., 2020), and a magnetic adsorbent for DCF was 261 mg/g (Leone et al., 2018). The adsorption capacity of OTC on hydroxyapatite reached 291.32 mg/g (Harja and Ciobanu, 2018), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes nanocomposite for OTC reached 429 mg/g (Chen et al., 2021a). Ramanayaka et al. (2020) used biochar to remove oxytetracycline from synthetic hydrolyzed urine, and the adsorption process reached equilibrium within 5 h, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 136.7 mg/g. It is difficult to judge the data listed due to the different experimental parameters and the physicochemical characteristics of adsorbents; however, the results of the present study are encouraging."
11,Thermodynamics of pharmaceutical adsorption,"3.4 Thermodynamics of pharmaceutical adsorption To study the thermodynamics of pharmaceutical adsorption, the Gibbs free energy change ΔG° (kJ/mol), the adsorption enthalpy change ΔH° (kJ/mol), and the entropy change ΔS° (kJ/mol K) were calculated. The values of ΔH° and ΔS° were evaluated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln K d vs. 1/T, and ΔG° was calculated using equations in the Supplementary Material. The calculated results are listed in Table 1 . The adsorption process was feasible and thermodynamically spontaneous because the value of ΔG° was negative (Zoltowska-Aksamitowska et al., 2018). The value of ΔS° was positive, reflecting an increase in the randomness at the solid-liquid interface in this reaction, which made the adsorption more stable and irreversible, indicating the affinity of the adsorbents to the two pharmaceuticals (Andrade et al., 2020). The ΔH° for OTC adsorption was positive, which indicated that this process was endothermic and that a higher temperature promoted adsorption. It could be attributed to the increased diffusion rate and surface coverage of contaminants on adsorbents at higher temperature (Wang et al., 2010). The adsorption process of DCF was exothermic, probably because the target pharmaceuticals tended to escape from the solid phase into the liquid phase at higher temperatures (Peng et al., 2016). The early literatures have shown that temperature had a greater effect on the adsorption of hydrophobic than hydrophilic compounds, and DCF has a relatively high hydrophobicity (log Kow of DCF and OTC are 1.56 and −0.9, respectively) (Nam et al., 2014; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013). For the adsorption of FMC, the ΔH° value significantly varies with the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent and reaction conditions as a result of changes in the chemical properties and surface chemistry features of target compounds (Peng et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2010). In general, the similar behaviors for the adsorption of DCF and OTC by many carbon-based materials were observed in previous studies (Antunes et al., 2012; Avcu et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019)."
12,Influencing factors,"3.5 Influencing factors 3.5.1 Effect of pH Solution pH affects both the surface charge and ionic form of pollutants; therefore, adsorption experiments were performed in deionized water at various pH values to research the adsorption mechanism. The results showed that pH had a strong effect on the adsorption efficiency of both pharmaceuticals by FMC (Fig. 4 (a)). The adsorption capacity increased significantly upon increasing the pH, and DCF adsorption was more affected by pH than OTC. The pHPZC value of FMC was measured to be 6.6 (Fig. 4 (b)); therefore, the surface charge was negative for solution pH > pHPZC and positive for pH < pHPZC. The dissociation constant value (pK a) of DCF is 4.24; thus, DCF exists as a neutral species for pH ≤ 4.24 and as an anion at pH > 4.24 (Liang et al., 2020). Hence, when the solution was acidic, the adsorption mechanism likely included hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. When the pH was between 4.24 and 6.6, DCF was negatively charged, and electrostatic interactions occurred between the adsorbent and the pollutant. The negatively-charged adsorbent repelled the negatively-charged DCF at pH > 6.6. Because of protonation and deprotonation, OTC is positively charged below pH 3.3, negatively charged above 7.3, and zwitterionic between these two pH values (Andrade et al., 2020). As the pH increased from 2 to 4, no obvious changes in the OTC removal efficiency were observed. The removal efficiency decreased from 98.6% to 79.7% as the pH increased from 4 to 9. When OTC molecules exist as amphoteric ions, they are relatively hydrophobic and experience minimal electrostatic repulsion, and the surface oxygenic groups on the molecules can connect to the adsorbent via hydrogen bonds. As the pH continued to increase, hydrogen bonding was hindered because the concentration of hydroxide ions gradually increased. At this time, the adsorbent and OTC were both negatively charged, which lead to electrostatic repulsion. 3.5.2 Effect of urine characteristics The physicochemical properties in urine solution change with the prolonged storage time. The effect of the major urine components was investigated by adding individual chemicals to deionized water. The pH of solutions was adjusted to the same value as those in synthetic urine before adsorption. Finally, the influence was calculated via the following equation (Sun et al., 2018). (3) P r o m o t i o n ( % ) = [ C ] a q , D I W / [ C ] 0 − [ C ] a q , i / [ C ] 0 1 − [ C ] a q , D I W / [ C ] 0 where [C] aq,i is the pharmaceutical concentration with urine component i; [C] aq ， DIW is the pharmaceutical concentration in deionized water; [C] 0 is the initial pharmaceutical concentration. All units are mg/L. The adsorption capacity of DCF was remarkably improved after adding NaCl due to an increased ionic strength (Fig. 5 ). This suggests that a high ionic strength helped neutralize the adsorbent by double-layer compression, which weakens electrostatic repulsion (Shin et al., 2020). It may also be due to the salting-out phenomena, in which the solubility of an adsorbate decreases as the ionic strength increases, which enhances adsorption (Peng et al., 2016). The results show that ionic strength had an insignificant effect on OTC adsorption, probably because OTC was neutral in the pH range of urine. PO4–P had a small influence (<3%) on the adsorption of both pharmaceuticals; however, urea and ammonia greatly inhibited the adsorption of DCF and OTC. Research by Paredes-Laverde et al. (2019) indicated that adsorption of acetaminophen by biochar was better in deionized water than in urine, likely because urea competed with acetaminophen for adsorption sites. Citrate and bicarbonate were present in fresh and hydrolyzed urine, respectively. As a model natural organic metabolite, citrate should be taken into account because it is anionic with three deprotonated oxygen atoms. As shown in Fig. 5, the results indicate that the citrate in fresh urine inhibited the adsorption efficiency of two pharmaceuticals to a certain degree. The addition of citrate decreased the removal of DCF and OTC by 4.17% and 3.19%, respectively. This decrease occurred because citrate contains oxygen functional groups that could accept and donate hydrogen bonds (Solanki and Boyer, 2019). Bicarbonate promoted the adsorption in deionized water at a pH of 9. Previous studies have shown that bicarbonate may promote or inhibit pharmaceutical adsorption, which is related to the characteristics of the adsorbent and pollutant (Sun et al., 2018). The adsorption potential changed at different ionic strengths and constituents in fresh and hydrolyzed urine because fresh urine undergoes hydrolysis upon prolonging the storage time. The urea in fresh urine could be converted to ammonium and bicarbonate, which would increase the pH from 6 to 9 (Solanki and Boyer, 2017). According to experimental results, the adsorption capacity of the FMC in fresh urine was higher than that in hydrolyzed urine. Although bicarbonate and a higher ionic strength increased the adsorption, changes in the pH of hydrolyzed urine had a greater impact on the removal efficiency of the target pollutants. Generally, the high removal efficiencies of the FMC in both urine types provided greater flexibility during actual treatment processes, as it would not be necessary to pay too much attention to the storage time of the urine."
13,Nutrient adsorption capacity and reusability of the FMC,"3.6 Nutrient adsorption capacity and reusability of the FMC After the pharmaceutical adsorption reached equilibrium (2 h), the concentrations of PO4–P and TN in urine were measured. As shown in Fig. 6 , less than 6% of TN and 7% of PO4–P were removed by FMC, showing that the prepared FMC absorbent could selectively remove pharmaceuticals from urine. In fresh and hydrolyzed urine, nitrogen is present mainly in the forms of urea and ammonia, respectively; thus, the low removal could be explained by its low molecular weight and the absence of a charge. The high retention rate of PO4–P was probably because of the repulsion between negatively charged phosphate and the negatively charged adsorbent (Ramanayaka et al., 2020). Therefore, although there was a high concentration of nutrients in urine, high concentrations of PO4–P and TN in urine remained after adsorption using the prepared FMC. When using urine as a fertilizer, urine residues with a high nutrient concentration are beneficial. It is important to assess the regeneration and cyclic use of the adsorbents for potential applications in urine or effluent treatment. As shown in Fig. S4, the recovered FMC still possessed a high removal efficiency after five reuse cycles, and the adsorbability of FMC for both pharmaceuticals remained above 90%. In fresh urine, the adsorption capacity changed within the range 236.22–220.15 mg/g for DCF and 305.98–291.24 mg/g for OTC."
14,Proposed adsorption mechanisms,"3.7 Proposed adsorption mechanisms The adsorption mechanisms of organic pollutants may be synergistic adsorption involving a variety of adsorption forces, including pore-filling, hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, and electrostatic attraction (Tomul et al., 2020). The main mechanism is highly dependent on several factors, such as the type of adsorbate, adsorbent characteristics, and solution conditions. For fresh urine, OTC exists in its neutral form, and DCF is partially ionized. At pH = 6, the surface charge on the FMC is near the point of zero charge. Therefore, the electrostatic interactions between two pharmaceuticals and FMC are weak, and the high contaminant removal efficiency of mesoporous carbon in fresh urine was mainly because of hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. According to the characterization results, the FMC provides adsorption sites via its oxygen-rich functional groups and high graphitic carbon content, while DCF or OTC are strong electron acceptors due to their conjugated benzene rings and amino groups (Zhang et al., 2020). In hydrolyzed urine, electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbents and pollutants with the same charge decreased the adsorption efficiency; however, compared with adsorption in deionized water (pH = 9), the adsorption efficiencies of DCF and OTC in hydrolyzed urine were much higher. This shows that other mechanisms are involved in pharmaceutical adsorption besides π-π interactions. For example, salting-out may have reduced the adsorbate's solubility in solution (Shin et al., 2020), or cations in the solution may have mediated binding by forming bridges between the negative charges on the pollutants and the adsorbent sites. Negative charge-assisted hydrogen bonds could also play a role since the pharmaceuticals and FMC both have negative surface charges (Masrura et al., 2020). Negatively-charged organic matter may dissociate water molecules and form strong hydrogen bonds with functional groups of the adsorbent. DCF showed a lower adsorption than OTC in both fresh and hydrolyzed urine, likely because OTC contains more amino groups and conjugated benzene rings, which can interact with FMC via π-π interactions and hydrogen bonds."
15,Conclusion,"The FMC synthesized in this research possessed abundant oxygenic groups and a high surface area. Because of its excellent adsorption of DCF and OTC, the FMC can be used as a suitable adsorbent for removing anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics with similar properties to DCF and OTC from contaminated urine or wastewater. FMC had a low removal rate of TN and PO4–P from urine, showing that it could be used to selectively remove drugs from urine, making it useful as a pharmaceutical-free agricultural fertilizer. The adsorption kinetics data in synthetic urine were well-fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Langmuir model described the adsorption process better than the Freundlich model, but the Sips model provided the best fit. The adsorption process was feasible and thermodynamically spontaneous, and the FMC showed a high affinity for both pharmaceuticals."
