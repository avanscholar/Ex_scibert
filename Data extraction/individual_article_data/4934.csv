0,Introduction,"There has been increasing interest in nanoporous metals in many fields [1]. Nanoporous gold (NPG) has promising applications in catalysis and sensing using electrochemical techniques owing to its high conductivity, catalytic activity, chemical inertness, physical stability, and facile surface modification [2]. Several efficient electrocatalytic reactions using NPG have been reported, such as reductions of CO2 and H2O2, oxidations of alcohol, glucose, CO, and aromatic compounds, and hydrogenation reactions of alkynes and alkenes [3–10]. The abundant low-coordinated surface atoms at the steps/kinks play a key role in the activity of nanostructured gold materials [11–13]. However, surface crystallographic orientations also play crucial roles in determining the activity of gold electrodes. For example, single-crystal electrodes reveal a clear dependence on the crystallographic orientation for NADH and methanol oxidation [14,15] and CO2 reduction [16]. Therefore, controlling the crystallographic orientation in NPG could produce a desirable catalyst with enhanced performance. To date, NPG has been extensively studied by selectively etching a less noble component in gold-containing alloys, and its catalytic origin has been discussed [17,18]. Recently, a more facile method, anodizing conventional polycrystalline Au electrodes, has been developed to prepare NPG structures [19,20]. Anodization in a solution containing 0.5–2 M Cl− offers a rapid (within 2 min) strategy for constructing NPG [20–23]. The obtained structures exhibited ligaments and pores and were similar to those formed by the dealloying method. However, a strategy for controlling the surface crystallographic orientation (atomic surface structure) by this method has not been well-explored. Although the aforementioned dealloying method has been developed in terms of pore size control and effective process [24,25] the remaining less noble atom (e.g., Ag in an NPG prepared from Au–Ag alloy) is sometimes problematic in terms of data interpretation [26]. Hence, a method for controlling the surface orientation of anodized NPG would be useful. Herein, we report that the Cl− concentration during anodization affects the crystallographic orientational compositions of the prepared NPG surface. Additionally, applications of the NPG with different facet compositions for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are also demonstrated."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Lead nitrate, and other chemicals were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp. (Japan). All chemicals were used as received without any further purification. All solutions were prepared with purified water (Millipore, 18 MΩ cm). Electrodes including gold disk, Pt wire, Hg/HgO and Ag|AgCl|sat.KCl were obtained from Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (U.S.A.). A carbon felt sheet was purchased from Nippon Carbon Co., Ltd. (Japan)."
3,Preparation of nanoporous gold electrodes,"2.2 Preparation of nanoporous gold electrodes A gold disk electrode (ø = 3 mm) was polished with 1 and 0.125 μm of diamond slurries followed by 0.05 μm of alumina slurry until a clear mirror-like surface was obtained with a surface roughness factor (R f) of 1.05–1.10. The R f value was estimated by dividing the electrochemical surface area by the geometrical area. The electrochemical (actual) surface area was evaluated from the reductive charge of a gold oxide(s) in a cyclic voltammogram of H2SO4 solution between −0.014 and 1.714 V (vs. RHE). The reductive charge was divided by 390 µC cm−2, assuming the AuO monolayer coverage [27]. The polished electrode was electrochemically cleaned in 0.5 M H2SO4. The cleaned electrode was immersed in a certain concentration of HCl solution, and a potential depending on the used HCl concentration was applied for 1–60 min to fabricate the nanoporous structure as previously reported [28]. Before anodization, linear scan voltammetry was conducted to evaluate the passivation potential (Fig. S1), where the gold surface had been passivated by the formation of an oxide layer with a sudden current drop [20,23] or it may have resulted from the consumption of chloride ion. Then, the anodization potential for NPG preparation was examined to be more negative of the passivation potential according to the literature [23]. The morphology of the NPG surface was analyzed by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) characterization (S-4300 FE-SEM, Hitachi Ltd., Japan)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All the electrochemical measurements were performed with an ALS model 660D electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments Inc.) with a normal three-electrode configuration consisting of an Ag|AgCl|sat.KCl or Hg/HgO reference electrode, a Pt or carbon felt auxiliary electrode, and a NPG or normal gold working electrode. Results were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The solution was bubbled with Ar (99.999%) before each measurement. The lead under potential deposition (Pb-UPD) characterization was carried out at ambient temperature. The voltammograms were recorded in a 0.1 M NaOH solution containing 1 mM Pb(NO3)2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under Ar atmosphere. For the reductive desorption experiment, the NPG electrodes prepared were immersed in an ethanolic solution of 1 mM 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) for 1–12 h, then washed with ethanol and pure water before the desorption voltammetry was conducted [29]. Reductive desorption voltammograms were recorded in Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted for HER in an Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 with IR drop correction. Before the measurement, a resistance test was carried out, and the iR compensation was performed using the CHI software [30]. For the HER measurement, a carbon felt electrode was used as an auxiliary electrode because metal materials, such as, Pt have been reported to influence the activity [31]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Morphology of NPGs prepared in different Cl− concentrations,"3.1 Morphology of NPGs prepared in different Cl− concentrations Because the potential during anodization process strongly affects the success/failure of NPG construction [23], we carefully examined the potentials that produce nanoporous structure. HCl concentrations of 35 and 500 mM gave different anodization potentials, averaged as 1.463 and 1.546 V vs. RHE, respectively. Fig. 1 A and B shows the surface morphologies of the NPGs obtained from 35 and 500 mM HCl solutions (NPG-35 and NPG-500, respectively), together with that of the gold surface before anodization (Fig. 1C). The R f value was arranged to be similar for NPG-35 and NPG-500 by controlling the anodization time, which should lead to simple interpretation of the data. Each NPG exhibited a nanoporous structure with ligaments and pores similar to those in previous reports [19–23]. The concentration of Cl− during the anodization process affects the ligament size [21,22] where a higher concentration of Cl− increases the dissolution of gold and growth of ligaments (re-deposition of dissolved gold atoms, as discussed in Section 3.3). Hence, we expected a larger ligament size in NPG-500 than that in NPG-35. However, no significant difference in surface morphology between them was observed (Fig. 1A and B). As the anodization time also seems to significantly contribute to the determination of ligament size [20,21] this may be a main reason for the similar morphology between NPG-35 and NPG-500. To investigate the effects of anodization time on the surface morphology/ligament size, we subsequently anodized the gold electrode at the same potential; however, for a different period of time. The obtained SEM images are illustrated in Fig. S2. As it can be seen, each NPG exhibits a nanoporous structure, though the ligament size is noticeably different. Moreover, it was determined that the size increased with the increase in the anodization time for NPGs prepared in both 35 and 500 mM HCl solutions. These results are in good agreement with the previous reports [20,21] and are consistent with the aforementioned re-deposition process during the formation of NPG. The comparison of the SEM images of NPG-35 and NPG-500 prepared at the same anodization time revealed that a higher concentration of chloride ions leads to the formation of larger ligaments in NPG. This suggests that the gold dissolution and re-deposition processes are faster in a 500 mM HCl solution than in a 35 mM HCl solution. This outcome is consistent with the fact that stronger surface diffusion of gold atom is observed at higher concentrations of Cl− [32]. Under the assumption that the effect of facet orientation on the estimation of the NPG surface area is neglected, the similar ligament sizes and surface areas (R f values) indicate that the depths of the nanoporous structures in NPG-35 and NPG-500 are analogous."
7,Electrochemical characterization of NPGs,"3.2 Electrochemical characterization of NPGs While having the similar morphologies, the voltammetric responses to the presence of Pb2+ (Pb UPD and stripping properties) differed considerably between the NPGs, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. Pb-UPD and stripping measurements are frequently used to evaluate the crystallographic orientations of gold electrode surfaces and have also been applied to nanoporous gold prepared by a dealloying method [33]. As the hindrance for Pb ion diffusion into the pores that are far from the solution phase was concerned, we conducted the linear sweep voltammetry with a sufficient incubation (Pd deposition) time at UPD potential. We investigated the effect of deposition time on the following stripping charge to determine the sufficient time to achieve a saturated deposition (Fig. S3). It was clear that 1 min was enough for saturation, and we employed this deposition time. NPG-35 exhibited main anodic peaks at 0.444 and at approximately 0.600 V. The former was sharp and close to the potentials of the stripping of Pb on Au(111) [33,34]. The latter peak was considerably broader than the former, indicating signal overlap due to the other orientations [35]. NPG-500 exhibited anodic currents at 0.492 and around 0.660 V with a shoulder peak at 0.622 V. The former peak was close to that representing Pb stripping on the Au(100) surface [33,34]. The voltammogram of the normal (before anodization) gold electrode showed two broad stripping peaks around 0.444 and 0.610 V shown in Fig. 1c. These differences in peak positions for each surface may suggest that the NPGs and normal gold surfaces have different facet contributions, as in a previous report of a dealloyed nanoporous structure [33]. To further investigate whether the facet composition of the anodized NPG surfaces were different, reductive desorption analysis was conducted for 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) adsorbed on NPG-35 and NPG-500 surfaces, because different desorption potentials were reported depending on the facet orientation [29]. The obtained voltammograms showed main peaks around 0.36 and 0.10 V (Fig. 2 ) with different peak ratios for NPG-35 and NPG-500. NPG-35 exhibited a larger peak at 0.360 V than other peak. On the other hand, NPG-500 had a smaller peak around 0.36 V and a larger peak at 0.064 V with a shoulder around 0.129 V. The desorption peak at 0.360 V for NPG-35 was similar to that of the Au(111) facet in the polycrystalline Au electrode, whereas the peaks at 0.064 and 0.129 V for NPG-500 could be correspond to those from Au(110) and Au(100) facets, respectively, based on a previous report [29]. As the ligament size and surface area (depth of the NPG structure) were similar, it is likely that the facet contributions in these NPGs were different. In addition, we conducted voltammetric analysis on NPG-35 and NPG-500 in an aqueous 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. In a voltammetric study of single-crystal gold electrodes, the shape of the voltammogram depended on the crystallographic orientation [36]. Recently, Jeyabharathi et al. [35] reported that the anodic peak potentials derived from the oxide film formation of a polycrystalline gold electrode in 0.1 M H2SO4 at 1.41, 1.47, and 1.62 V (vs. RHE) correspond to Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) low-index crystal planes, respectively. Panels A and B of Fig. 3 show the voltammograms of NPG-35 and NPG-500, respectively. The shapes of the anodic peak ranges obviously differed between the two NPGs. In NPG-35, the anodic peak at 1.62 V was much larger than the other anodic peaks, whereas in NPG-500, the largest peak appeared at 1.41 V. Again, these results imply a considerable amount of Au(111) and Au(100) facets in NPG-35 and NPG-500, respectively. Of note, that the MBA desorption and oxide film formation signals in the voltammetric curves of NPG electrodes are relatively broader than those of single crystal electrodes in previous reports [29,37]. This may be a consequence of the boundaries and steps/kinks in the NPG structure. Monolithic surface orientations cannot be formed in NPG, because the presence of some high-index facets and surface steps/kinks is required to accommodate the curvature in the 3D bicontinuous porosity [33]. Hence, an accurate composition of each facet on the NPG surface was not determined."
8,Mechanism of NPG formation,"3.3 Mechanism of NPG formation As mentioned above, the NPG surfaces prepared by anodization process in 35 and 500 mM HCl solutions display different electrochemical properties. Specifically, we established that NPG-35 and NPG-500 exhibit significant amounts of Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces, respectively, demonstrating a one-step facile method for altering the atomic structure of the NPG surface. Although some of the above observations remain unexplained, we speculate that they result from the differences in the gold dissolution rates in Cl− containing solutions. The mechanism of NPG formation by anodization in solutions containing Cl− is believed to progress via (1) electrochemical dissolution, (2) disproportionation and deposition, and (3) protection [20,23]. Initially, the Au surface is dissolved under the setting potential to form AuCl2 − and AuCl4 −, and the surface becomes rough. This is followed by AuCl2 − disproportionation to Au atoms and AuCl4 −; the Au atoms then aggregate and are redeposited on the roughened electrode surface to form NPG structure. The newly-deposited gold particles can be dissolved electrochemically, however, the gold oxide layer is formed when the Cl− at the surface is depleted [38] which protects the NPG layer from the electrochemical dissolution. The disruption of the gold oxide layer by a recovered Cl− during the longer period of time in anodization process is also reported [38]. Thus, the formation of nanoporous structure proceeds in combinations/cycles of these processes. Previous studies demonstrate that a narrow range of electrode potentials is required for an Au surface to form a nanoporous structure during anodization [20–23]. The applied potential apparently affects the kinetics of the Au dissolution as well as the oxide layer formation on Au, and hence also influences the re-deposition rate of the Au atoms. Therefore, the balance of the aforementioned processes appears to be important in the determination of the structure of anodized gold. To verify the effects of applied potential in anodization processes on the obtained surface structure, we anodized the gold electrode in a 500 mM HCl solution at potentials 0.1 V lower and higher than the appropriate value, which resulted in the formation of NPG structures shown in Fig. 1. The anodized surface obtained at the lower potential was yellowish and the SEM image exhibited a roughened surface without pores and ligaments (Fig. S3, left), with the Rf value of 1.28. This possibly indicates that at this potential, the dissolution process is more favored than the protection of NPG layer by the oxide film formation. Moreover, anodization at higher potential also did not afford a nanoporous structure (Fig. S3, right). This observation implies the oxide film formation was considerably favored due to the high potential. These results support the hypothesis that the balance of the aforementioned processes determines the surface structure obtained by anodization. We suspect that the difference in the kinetics of the aforementioned processes, in particular the Au dissolution process, leads to the production of NPGs with different facet contributions. As mentioned above, at lower Cl− concentration, longer anodization time is required to produce an NPG structure with the same Rf value as the one obtained at higher potential. This suggests that lower concentrations of Cl− result in slower Au dissolution, which allows for the deposited Au cluster/facet to be reorganized to the thermally stable orientation, i.e., Au(111) (Fig. 4 left). Consequently, the Au(111) facet was enhanced during anodization at lower Cl− concentration. On the other hand, the Au dissolution process is considerably faster at a higher concentration of Cl−; hence, it is expected to result in incomplete reorganization. This could lead to the formation of less stable facets, such as Au(100) (Fig. 4 right). Nonetheless, further studies are necessary to confirm this speculation."
9,Hydrogen evolution reaction at NPG,"3.4 Hydrogen evolution reaction at NPG To confirm the usefulness of the present method, we next examined the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using NPG-35 and NPG-500. Currently, Pt-based materials catalyze most effectively the HER, however, the scarcity of Pt limits their use. Hence, extensive efforts have been devoted to develop highly active alternatives [39–41]. Although gold has been known to be a poor catalyst for the HER [42], its nanocomposites show the improved activity [43–45]. Additionally, the atomic structure composition at the nanoporous gold also might affect the activity. Because alumina contamination by polishing gold material has recently shown to affect the HER activity [46], we checked its effect in the present NPG electrodes. Fig. S4 showed the hydrogen evolution voltammograms of NPG-35 with and without alumina slurries before the anodization process. No significant difference was observed. The anodization process may exclude the remaining Al2O3 on the surface. Fig. 5 A represents the obtained voltammograms in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with iR compensation, where the current density, j, in mA cm−2, was calculated from the actual surface area estimated electrochemically from the reductive charge of AuO. The charges for NPG-35 and NPG-500 were 148 and 164 µC, respectively; hence, the electrochemical surface area was calculated to be 0.38 and 0.42 cm2, respectively. To exclude the concern for the hindrance of proton diffusion into pores that are far from the solution phase, the effect of NPG electrochemical surface area, which correlates with the thickness of the NPG layer, on the HER reaction was firstly investigated. The relationship between the HER current density at −0.1 V and the NPG surface area (Fig. S6) showed that the current density of the NPG with a larger surface area, such as 1 cm2, was significantly smaller than that of the NPG with a smaller surface area, such as 0.45 cm2, indicating the limited proton diffusion at the deep side of NPG layer during the measurement under the present conditions. Moreover, when the surface area was smaller than about 0.5 cm2, similar values of current density were observed, indicating the less hindrance of proton diffusion. Therefore, we measured HER using NPGs with these kinds of surface area (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5A, NPG-35 exhibited a higher catalytic current than NPG-500 and normal gold. The current density in the voltammogram obtained for NPG-35 was about 2 times larger than that for NPG-500 at −0.1 V. The potentials providing the current density of 3 mA cm−2 were −0.049 V for NPG-35, whereas those of NPG-500 and normal gold were −0.073 and −0.149 V, respectively. The overpotential value for the NPG-35 electrode was considerably lower compared with those of other gold-based catalysts [45,47,48], indicating the effective enhancement in the hydrogen production by the present nanostructurization. Because NPG-35 and NPG-500 have similar morphologies when they have similar electrochemical surface areas, as shown in Fig. 1, the difference in current density for the HER may be ascribed to the difference in the facet compositions of each surface. Previous report, which used single-crystal gold electrode, showed that Au(111) exhibited about 2.3 times larger catalytic current than Au(100) at −0.3 V in 0.1 M HClO4 [49]. Further, gold nanospikes electrode having Au(111) dominated surface is also reported to show significant increase in the current density for HER [50]. Our results are consistent with these phenomena. Fig. 5B represents the Tafel plot for further understanding of the reaction [51]. We calculated the overpotential referring the 0.016 V as the equilibrium potential for all electrodes. The slopes of both NPGs and normal gold varied between lower and higher overpotential regions, similar to those in previous reports for gold-based catalysts [47,49,52,53]. The slopes for normal gold were 69 and 150 mV dec−1 in the lower and higher overpotential regions, respectively. These values are within the reported region for gold-based catalysts [43,44,49,54–56], indicating that the formation of a surface-adsorbed hydrogen atom (the proton discharge reaction known as the Volmer reaction) is the rate-determining step. The NPG-35 and NPG-500 exhibited the slopes of 42 and 57 mV dec−1 in the lower region, and 118 and 170 mV dec−1 in the higher region, respectively. The decrease of the slope in the lower region indicates the enhanced H adsorption process on the NPG surface owing to the nanostructured effect [43–45]. The slope variation for NPG-35 is close to those of the simulated curve (40 and 120 mV dec−1 in the lower and higher overpotential regions, respectively); here, an electrochemical desorption reaction (Heyrovsky reaction) is the rate-determining step [57], indicating the HER occurs through Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism at NPG-35. It is noteworthy that the estimated Tafel slope (42 mV dec−1) for NPG-35 in the lower overpotential region was different from that (60 mV dec−1) reported for a single crystal Au(111) electrode [49]. This implies that the Au(111) facet facilitates different reaction processes in the electrochemical HER at normal (planar) and nanoporous electrodes. Moreover, this observation reveals the importance of the control of the crystallographic orientation in nanostructured catalysts in electrocatalytic reactions. Thus, the obtained outcomes clearly demonstrate that the preparation of NPG utilizing the present method (i.e., anodization in a controlled concentration of Cl−) is remarkably effective for the development of efficient catalysts."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, in the present study, we demonstrated that anodization of conventional Au electrodes in different concentrations of Cl− led to the formation of NPG structures with different contributions of crystallographic plane orientations on the surface. NPGs with significant amounts of Au(100) and Au(111) surfaces were successfully prepared. Notably, the latter effectively catalyzed HER. The described method is simple and provides a valuable platform for gaining further understanding of the facet effect in various electrochemical reactions, which may lead to the development of new efficient catalysts."
