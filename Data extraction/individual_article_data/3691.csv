0,Introduction,"Luliconazole is a novel imidazole antifungal agent [1–3]. By inhibiting the sterol 14a-demethylase in fungal cells and thereby interfering with ergosterol biosynthesis, luliconazole shows broad-spectrum antifungal activity against dermatophytes, Malassezia species, dematiaceous hyphomycetes, Candida albicans, and onychomycosis [2–6]. Luliconazole was launched in Japan for fungal infection therapy in 2005 and was approved by the FDA in 2013 [7]. The chiral source, (S)-TCPE, is the most critical intermediate in producing luliconazole [8,9]. However, developed chemical synthesis routes for (S)-TCPE suffer from low efficiency, harsh reaction conditions and the need of expensive starting chiral materials [10], thus restricting the widespread application and distribution of luliconazole. Therefore, the opportunity for efficient and economic preparation of (S)-TCPE has attracted extensive attention. Biocatalysis provides a straightforward and attractive method to access the chiral intermediate due to the intrinsic enantioselectivity of enzymes and their environmental friendliness. Ketoreductases (KREDs) [11] are the most commonly used enzymes in industrial pharmaceutical synthesis [12–15]. By reducing a wide range of ketones to chemo- and stereo-selective alcohols, KREDs have been engineered to synthesize chiral intermediates for the production of atorvastatin [16], montelukast [17], and atazanavir [18]. (R)-TCPE has been synthesized through bioreduction of 2,2’,4’-trichloroacetophenone (TCAP) using alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) [19,20]. Though biosynthesis of (S)-TCPE was reported using a lipase [9], the theoretical yield was limited to 50%. Therefore, novel enzymes that enantioselectively catalyze the production of (S)-TCPE are still highly desired. Lactobacillus kefir KRED belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and forms tetramers in crystallographic and catalytically active forms [21,22]. L. kefir KRED exhibits (S)-selectivity towards 3-oxacyclopentanone, indicative of its potential in the preparation of (S)-alcohols [23,24]. We found that the wild-type L. kefir KRED was highly enantioselective towards TCAP (enantioselectivity excess ee S > 99%) but showed poor catalytic activity. We suspected that protein engineering could be used to obtain novel enantioselective L. kefir KRED variants with enhanced catalytic activity. Though the quadruple mutant of L. kefir KRED (A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) (initially designed for the asymmetric reduction of tert-butyl 6-chloro-3,5-dioxohexanoate and methyl-2-benzamidomethyl-3-oxobutyrate) [25] and the quintuple mutant (E67D/A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) [26] were recently found to show catalytic activity towards TCAP [8], their value in industrial applications needs to be further evaluated. In addition, the mechanisms for their enantioselectivity and the change in catalytic activity compared to the wild-type enzyme remain obscure. In the present study, rational design of the wild-type L. kefir KRED was performed to obtain enhanced catalytic activity towards TCAP with high enantioselectivity. Based on the binding characteristics of L. kefir KRED and TCAP revealed by molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations, three residues lining the substrate binding pocket were found influential to its catalytic activity. A triple mutant A94S/S96E/E145A with significantly improved catalytic activity and converting efficiency was identified. The cofactor recycling was implemented by adding isopropanol to the reaction system (Scheme 1 ). Furthermore, the mechanism that supports promotion of L. kefir KRED activity was unveiled at the atomic level."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The plasmid pET-28a(+), E. coli strain JM109 (DE3), and E. coli strain DH5α containing the L. kefir KRED gene (Genbank Accession No.: AAP94029), were stored in our lab. The T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Thermo Scientific. DNA polymerase (KOD) and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Toyobo Co., Ltd. All primers were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology (China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained commercially."
3,"Cloning, expression and purification","2.2 Cloning, expression and purification The PCR amplified product of the L. kefir KRED gene from the E. coli strain DH5α was digested with BamHI and NdeI and then ligated to the pET-28a vector with an N-terminal His6 tag. The constructed plasmid pET-28a-KRED was validated by DNA sequencing. The ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli JM109 (DE3) competent cells and expressed as follows: the E. coli JM109 (DE3) colony was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing kanamycin (0.1%). When the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the culture reached 0.4 to 0.6, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 12 h at 30°C, with shaking at 180 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min. An ultrasonic cell disruptor was used to disrupt the cell pellets, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min. Protein expression of KRED was checked using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The L. kefir KRED protein was purified using HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's description. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method with the bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard."
4,Library construction and screening,"2.3 Library construction and screening Based on the structure of the wild-type L. kefir KRED (PDB ID: 4RF2) and molecular simulations on the KRED-TCAP binding complex, residues of A94, E145, and S96 were discovered to line the inner side of binding pocket and play important roles in the regulation of binding pocket state, substrate orientation, and the state of substrate-binding loop, respectively. A94 was firstly mutated, followed by E145 (based on the best-performed single mutant of A94). Finally, based on the best-performed double mutant, S96 was combined to build triple mutants. Mutagenesis was performed by utilizing the wild-type gene that had been cloned in the pET-28a vector as the template for the (A94) single mutation. The double and triple mutations were achieved based on the measured activities obtained from respective optimal single and double variants through site-directed mutagenesis. The primers used are shown in Table S1. To eliminate the original template plasmid, 15 U DpnI was added to the PCR reaction mixture and incubated for 1.5 h at 25°C for restriction digestion. The reaction mixture was then transformed to E. coli JM109 (DE3) to create the library for screening. The colonies were transferred to 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plates containing 1 mL LB medium and 1 μL 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubated for 16 h at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. The culture was used for the expression and stored at −80°C with 100 μL sterile glycerol (10%, v/v) added. Library expression occurred in a volume of 1.6 mL HB-PET auto-induction medium loaded in round-bottom 96-deep-well plates (capacity, 2.2 mL). After inducing for 24 h at 37°C and shaking at 180 rpm, the cultures were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 1 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet of each well was used for the following reaction. The catalytic reaction was conducted in centrifuge tubes containing the substrate TCAP 5 mg, enzyme solution 100 μL, PB 700 μL (0.1 M, pH 7.5), isopropanol 200 μL, and NADP+ 50 μL (10 mg/mL). After reacting for 30 h at 30°C and 180 rpm, the reaction solution was extracted with 1 mL n-hexane and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was used for measurement of catalytic activity. The enantiomeric excess (ee) was determined by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TCAP and (S)-TCPE were analyzed using the CHIRAL AD-H (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, DAICEL, Shanghai) column with a mobile phase of 90% hexane (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 10% isopropanol at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Both TCAP and (S)-TCPE were detected at 205 nm. The retention times of TCAP, (R)-TCPE, and (S)-TCPE were 7.11, 7.96, and 9.15 min, respectively. The reaction without the enzyme was used as a blank control, and the reaction without substrate TCAP was used as a background control. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra and were recorded using the Bruker AVANCE III 300 MHz and Quantum-I Plus 500 MHz spectrometers, respectively. The 1H NMR chemical shift data were reported on δ (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane, and the 13C NMR chemical shift data were reported on δ (ppm) relative to CDCl3."
5,Activity assay and kinetics characterization,"2.4 Activity assay and kinetics characterization Enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 30°C by monitoring the decrease of the absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. The reaction mixture comprised 10 μL purified enzyme solution, 2890 μL phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5), 50 μL 45 mM substrate (dissolved by DMSO), and 50 μL NADPH (10 mg/mL). One unit of enzyme activity (1 U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to consume 1.0 μmol of TCAP per minute under the assay conditions used. All experiments were repeated three times. The kinetic parameters of the optimal single, double and triple mutants were determined by measuring the initial activity under various substrate concentrations (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 mM). The values and corresponding errors for Vmax and Km were calculated from the Michaelis–Menten equation using the non-linear least squares fitting method."
6,Temperature and pH effects on the activities and stabilities of the optimal L. kefir KRED mutants,"2.5 Temperature and pH effects on the activities and stabilities of the optimal L. kefir KRED mutants The effects of temperature and pH on the activities of L. kefir KREDs were evaluated by measuring the initial hydrolytic rates of TCAP under various reaction conditions. The optimum temperature for the best-performing mutants was determined under standard assay conditions at the respective temperatures (25–50°C). For the thermal stability test, the purified enzymes were incubated at different temperatures (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50°C) for 1 h, and the residual activity was determined as described above. The optimum pH values of the best-performed variants were determined at 30°C in the following buffers: sodium acetate-acetic acid (pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0) and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate-potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0). For the pH stability test, the purified enzymes were incubated in different buffers (pH 5.0–8.0) at 4°C for 12 h before measuring the residual activities at 30°C."
7,Kilogram-scale preparation of (S)-TCPE,"2.6 Kilogram-scale preparation of (S)-TCPE To explore the industrialization potential, the triple mutant (A94S/S96E/E145A) gene was transformed into E. coli JM109 (DE3) cells, cultured and expressed in a 5000 L fermenter. The wet cells of A94S/S96E/E145A were harvested through centrifugation with tubular bowl centrifuge (15000 g, 500 L/h). Then, 275 kg TCAP was added to a reaction mixture (3000 L) containing 106 kg wet cells [26], 550 kg isopropanol, and 150 g NADP+. The reaction system was stirred at 35°C and the pH was automatically maintained at 7.3‒7.5 by titrating with sodium dihydrogen phosphate. After the catalytic reaction was complete (conversion rate > 98%), the solution was filtered at 5°C. The dried solid was dissolved by methanol at 45°C and the insoluble materials were removed. Finally, water was added at 10‒15°C and the system was dried at 20‒30°C to complete the process."
8,Molecular docking and molecular dynamics,"2.7 Molecular docking and molecular dynamics Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock 4.2 software [27]. The crystallographically determined tetrameric structure of the wild-type L. kefir KRED (PDB ID: 4RF2) [23] was used as the acceptor, and the mutant structure was built using UCSF Chimera software [28] based on 4RF2. The substrate structure of TCAP was generated using GaussView software and optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level [29]. The grid box was displaced to encircle the catalytic pocket with a dimension of 60 × 60 × 60 grid points with grid spacing of 0.375 Å. One hundred fifty independent docking runs were carried out for TCAP. The docking conformations were clustered according to a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) criterion of 1.0 Å, and the most energetically favorable structure in the largest cluster was chosen as the binding conformation of TCAP. MD simulations on the binding complexes of the wild-type L. kefir KRED/mutant and TCAP were performed using AMBER 12 software [30] with the AMBER FF14SB [31] and GAFF [32] force fields applied for the enzyme and TCAP, respectively. The parameters for NADPH were obtained from literature reference [33]. The RESP [34] partial atomic charges were assigned for TCAP according to the published protocol. A truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules with a margin distance of 10 Å and Na+ counterions was added to simulate a neutralized solvent environment. Other parameters and simulation procedures were set according to previous reports [28,35]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Rational construction of mutant library,"3.1 Rational construction of mutant library To efficiently obtain L. kefir KRED variants with desired activity and enantioselectivity, rational design was applied based on the structural characteristics of KRED and the KRED-TCAP binding complex. The proposed catalytic mechanism of KRED includes a hydride transfer from NADPH and a subsequent proton transfer from Y156 (Fig. 1 A) [36,37]. In the wild-type KRED, the small binding pocket is defined by the hydrogen bond between E145 and Y190 (Fig. 1B), while the most flexible substrate-binding loop (spanning roughly residues 190‒210) encloses the entire binding pocket [23]. The conformational states of the binding pocket can be monitored and classified according to the distance between the Cα atoms of A94 and L195 (Cα94‒Cα195), with a distance more/less than 12 Å indicating the open/closed state of the binding pocket [23]. The distance variation and its distribution during the 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (Fig. S1A) are plotted in Fig. 1C and 1D. These results show that the maximum distance is less than 9 Å, representing the closed state of the binding pocket. The binding structure of KRED and TCAP was obtained through molecular docking calculations to identify the key residues responsible for KRED activity. These show a nonreactive conformation of TCAP with severe steric hindrance at the small binding pocket (Fig. 2 A and 2B). The fluctuating root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of TCAP in MD simulation indicate its unstable binding with KRED (Fig. S1B). Incremental fluctuations of the distances between the atoms involved in the catalytic reaction, including HNADPH‒CTCAP, HY156‒OTCAP, and HS143‒OTCAP, indicate that TCAP gradually escapes from the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 2C). This agrees with the poor activity of wild-type L. kefir KRED towards TCAP. Of note, the dissociation of TCAP induces an occasional opening of the binding pocket as indicated by the variation and distribution of the distance between Cα94 and Cα195 (Fig. 2D). To efficiently produce (S)-TCPE with L. kefir KRED, TCAP needs to bind to the binding pocket such that the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group is located at the large binding pocket (comprising residues A94, S96, L153, Y156, L195, and L199) and the chloromethyl group is located at the small binding pocket (comprising residues I144, E145, G189, and Y190) (Fig. 1A and 2A, respectively). Therefore, the substrate binding pocket in wild-type L. kefir KRED should be reconfigured to allow TCAP to be well accommodated in the correct conformation. Attention is mainly focused on the residues lining the inner side of binding pocket, which are crucial in determining both the stereoselectivity of KRED and the open and closed state of the entire binding pocket (Fig. 2B) [23], rather than the substrate-binding loop residues. A94 was considered for mutation to convert the small non-polar residue into a medium-sized polar residue, such as serine, threonine, asparagine and glutamine, in order to break its close contact with L195. This would facilitate the accommodation of the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group of TCAP in the large binding pocket (Fig. 2A and 2B). Subsequently, E145 was identified for replacement by small- and medium-sized residues with no or low sidechain polarity, including alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine and valine, with the intent of breaking the hydrogen bond between E145 and Y190 and facilitating the accommodation of the chloromethyl group of TCAP in the small binding pocket (Fig. 2A and 2B). To modulate the open and closed state of the L. kefir KRED binding pocket, S96 was mutated to alanine to eliminate its potential direct or water mediated hydrogen bond interactions with the negatively charged residues from the substrate-binding loop (D197, D198 and E200) (Fig. 2B). S96 was also site mutated to aspartic acid and glutamic acid in an attempt to facilitate the opening of the binding pocket through electrostatic repulsion within the negatively charged substrate-binding loop (Fig. 2B). In summary, three sites, specifically A94, E145, and S96, were sequentially selected for site mutation and subsequently combined for the rational re-design of L. kefir KRED."
11,Screening of mutant library,"3.2 Screening of mutant library The results of the activity assays of wild-type L. kefir KRED and designed mutants are summarized in Fig. 3 and Table S2. The specific activity of wild-type KRED was too low to be detected (Table S2), revealing the need for activity enhancement. In the first round of site mutations, all the designed mutants showed elevated activities towards TCAP, except for mutant A94T, which showed decreased activity. The latter substitution was likely unsuccessful because of a steric hindrance coming from the inappropriately oriented methyl group of threonine. A94S was found to be 12.5-fold more active than the wild-type KRED (Fig. 3A and Table S2). Based on mutant A94S, in the second round of substitutions, E145 was site mutated to several specific residues to release restrictions on the small binding pocket. A further promoted double mutant A94S/E145A was obtained, which was found to be about 5-fold more active than mutant A94S, and 66-fold more active than the wild-type KRED (Fig. 3B and Table S2). All the double mutants showed improved activities towards TCAP except for mutant A94S/E145I (Fig. 3B and Table S2). By comparing the activities of mutants A94S/E145L and A94S/E145I (Fig. 3B and Table S2), we deduced that the inactivation of mutant A94S/E145I was probably due to the destruction of the small binding pocket caused by the sidechain sec-butyl group of isoleucine. In the third round of substitutions, attempts to open the substrate binding pocket based on the double mutant A94S/E145A resulted in discovering a best-performed triple mutant A94S/S96E/E145A whose relative activity is 117-fold greater than the wild-type KRED (Fig. 3C and Table S2). Elimination of potential hydrogen bond interactions through the S96A substitution also yielded the triple mutant A94S/E145A/S96A with increased relative activity relative to A94S/E145A (Fig. 3C and Table S2). Compared to aspartic acid, glutamic acid was more effective in elevating the specific activity of KRED, likely because the more extended sidechain group of glutamic acid at the site more effectively opens the substrate binding pocket through electrostatic repulsions with the negatively charged substrate-binding loop. Notably, all the designed mutants showed high enantioselectivities towards TCAP with the enantiomeric excess of product (S)-TCPE (ee S ) values being greater than 99%. To compare with the reported quadruplex mutant A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L [25], catalytic reactions were conducted in centrifuge tubes containing the substrate TCPA 10 mg, wet cells 10 mg, PB 1400 μL (0.1 M, pH 7.5), isopropanol 400 μL, and NADP+ 50 μL (10 mg/mL). After reacting for 6 h at 30°C, both the triple (A94S/S96E/E145A) and quadruple (A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L) mutants achieved their maximum conversions to TCPA (Fig. S2), which were 78.6% and 79%, respectively. The result indicates that these two mutants show comparable catalytic activities to the substrate. In summary, through three rounds of rational mutagenesis on L. kefir KRED, a triple mutant A94S/S96E/E145A was evolved, displaying high activity and high enantioselectivity towards TCAP."
12,Kinetic parameters of the variants,"3.3 Kinetic parameters of the variants To confirm the enhanced activity of the designed mutants, steady-state kinetic parameters were measured through non-linear regression analysis [23] with TCAP as the substrate at different concentrations (Fig. S3). As shown in Table 1 , the K m values of mutants, A94S, A94S/E145A, and A94S/S96E/E145A, decreased successively, indicating increasing binding affinity between TCAP and KRED mutants. Meanwhile, the corresponding k cat values increased from 1.45 s−1 to 5.15 s−1, showing improved catalytic rate constants. The improvement in the substrate-binding affinity and turnover frequency of the mutants contributed to their enhanced catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m). The triple mutant A94S/S96E/E145A showed a 9.1-fold higher k cat/K m value (5.17 s−1mM−1) than the single mutant A94S (0.57 s−1mM−1). The continuous improvement of the enzymatic properties of designed mutants verifies the success of our mutation strategy. Compared to the virtually inactive wild-type L. kefir KRED, our evolved triple mutant shows promising reaction kinetics for application in the production of (S)-TCPE."
13,Effects of temperature and pH on variant activity and stability,"3.4 Effects of temperature and pH on variant activity and stability To further characterize the L. kefir KRED variants, both the temperature and pH effects on the activity and stability were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 A, activities of the best-performing single, double, and triple mutants showed similar trends as temperatures increased from 25 to 50°C. An exception is that the maximum activity of the triple mutant A94S/S96E/E145A was observed at 45°C. The enhanced activity was at the expense of stability. The three mutants maintained over 82% of their catalytic activities at temperatures between 25‒30°C, then the activities rapidly declined from 35 to 50°C (Fig. 4B). Therefore, 30°C would be an appropriate temperature for both catalytic reaction and industrial application. As shown in Fig. 4C, all the three mutants showed their maximum activities at pH 5.0, demonstrating clear acidophilic behavior. The activities of mutants A94S and A94S/E145A linearly decreased as the pH increased from 5.0 to 8.0. A sub-optimal pH value of 7.5 was observed for the mutant A94S/S96E/E145A, which maintained 72% of its maximum activity (Fig. 4C). In the stability test, the optimal pH values were found to be 6.5, 6.0, and 7.0 for the variants of A94S, A94S/E145A, and A94S/S96E/E145A, respectively (Fig. 4D), indicating that their high activities at lower pH values (e.g., 5.0) were at the cost of stability. However, the triple mutant achieved a good balance between catalytic activity and stability at a pH value around 7.5."
14,Preparation of (S)-TCPE using the triple mutant of L. kefir KRED,"3.5 Preparation of (S)-TCPE using the triple mutant of L. kefir KRED The industrial-scale application of the A94S/S96E/E145A variant was further evaluated for the synthesis (S)-TCPE by asymmetric reduction of TCAP. The biotransformation conditions for the kilogram-scale preparation of (S)-TCPE were optimized for a 3000 L reaction mixture comprising 35 g/L wet cells of the triple mutant (A94S/S96E /E145A), 183 g/L isopropanol, and 0.05 g/L NADP+. Since the A94S/S96E /E145A mutant showed relatively higher activity at 35°C than at 30°C, and it retained 85% catalytic activity upon reaction of 12 h at 35°C (Fig. 4A and 4B), the mixture was stirred at 35°C to better control the temperature of the large-scale reaction system. pH was automatically maintained at 7.3‒7.5 by titrating sodium dihydrogen phosphate. Under these reaction conditions, 275 kg of TCAP was converted to (S)-TCPE within 12 h. Then, 253 kg (S)-TCPE was obtained, representing a final yield of approximately 91%. The optical purity of (S)-TCPE was determined to be 99%, and the product was characterized by NMR. Only low temperature isolation, filtration precipitation, and treatment with methanol were needed to obtain the (S)-TCPE products. Compared with the reported quadruple mutant of L. kefir KRED (A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L)8 and enzymatic synthesis of (S)-TCPE by the method using lipases,9 the current strategy did not need glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) for NADPH cycling. It accomplished significant progress by utilizing milder reaction conditions and exhibited higher efficiency, easier separation, and faster extraction means via a method that is more environmentally friendly."
15,Structural insights into the activity promotion,"3.6 Structural insights into the activity promotion By screening a limited mutagenesis library constructed through rational design, a triple mutant with desired activity and enantioselectivity towards TCAP was obtained. Molecular simulations were further performed to acquire insight into the mechanisms that promote activity of mutant A94S/S96E/E145A. Upon reaching equilibrium for the 100 ns MD simulation (Fig. S4A), the structure of A94S/S96E/E145A‒NADPH was superimposed on the wild-type L. kefir KRED structure. As shown in Fig. 5 A, except for the substrate-binding loop domain, the remaining structures of mutant A94S/S96E/E145A and wild-type KRED overlap well. The residues (S143, Y156 and K160) and cofactor NADPH that involve in affecting the catalytic reaction exhibit consistent orientations. As expected, mutations of A94S and S96E lead to the outward shift of the substrate-binding loop and the open state of the substrate binding pocket. Substitution of E145A successfully enlarged the small binding pocket by removing the original hydrogen bond restriction (Fig. 2A). The variations of the Cα94‒Cα195 distance demonstrates that the substrate binding pocket opens occasionally when the system achieves MD equilibration (Fig. 5B). The opening differs from the completely closed state of wild-type KRED (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, the distance distribution shows in MD simulation, that over 30% of snapshots had their substrate binding pockets in the open state with the Cα94‒Cα195 distances being greater than 12 Å (Fig. 5C and 5D). Overall, the altered conformations of the binding pocket and the substrate-binding loop produced by the mutation A94S/S96E/E145A effectively decreases the steric hindrance seen in WT L. kefir KRED and thus facilitates the binding of TCAP to the triple mutant. Compared to the nonreactive binding mode of TCAP and wild-type KRED, molecular docking produced a well-oriented binding conformation of TCAP in the enlarged substrate binding pocket of mutant A94S/S96E/E145A (Fig. 6 A). The 2,4-dichlorophenyl and chloromethyl groups of TCAP are located at the large and small binding pockets, respectively, with the carbonyl group forming two hydrogen bonds with S143 and Y156 (Fig. 6A and 6B). Thus, TCAP shows a pro-(S) orientation in the binding pocket (Fig. 6B), agreeing well with our experimental results. The distance between HNADPH‒CTCAP (2.96 Å) is appropriate for initiating the catalytic reaction (Fig. 6B). In addition, a halogen bond formed between the chloromethyl group of TCAP and the backbone carbonyl group of G188, further enhances the binding affinity between TCAP and mutant A94S/S96E/E145A (Fig. 6B). In contrast to the large fluctuations of the key distances including HNADPH‒CTCAP, HY156‒OTCAP, and HS143‒OTCAP in the wild-type KRED‒TCAP binding complex (Fig. 2C), MD simulation demonstrates that such distances in the binding complex of A94S/S96E/E145A‒TCAP remain stable and reasonable (Fig. 6C). The RMSD curve of bound TCAP in the triple mutant exhibits small fluctuations as well (Fig. S4B), indicating stable binding. Interestingly, the substrate binding pocket becomes predominantly closed upon binding of TCAP as indicated by the variation and distribution of the CαS94‒CαL195 distance (Fig. 6C and 6D). This demonstrates a clear induced fit, which facilitates the enhancement of binding affinity and catalytic efficiency."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, based on the characterized structural features of wild-type L. kefir KRED, a rational design was successfully applied to enhance catalytic activity of the conversion of TCAP to (S)-TCEP. An enantioselective triple mutant with highly promoted catalytic activity for TCAP substrate was identified. Mutant A94S/S96E/E145A displayed a 117-fold increase in relative activity compared to the wild-type enzyme, and the catalytic efficiency was determined to be 5.17 s−1mM−1. A kilogram-scale preparation of (S)-TCPE using the triple mutant provided evidence of its substantial potential for industrial applications. Molecular docking and MD simulations revealed that the promotion of enzymatic property could be realized by rearrangement of the substrate binding pocket, which also facilitated the accommodation of TCAP in the required orientation. The present work presents an efficient strategy for enzyme design by screening a very limited mutagenesis library and paves the way for a sustainable biocatalytic process for producing (S)-TCPE."
