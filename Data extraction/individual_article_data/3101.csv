0,Introduction,"Eventual realization of an hydrogen economy requires cheap and readily available hydrogen sources and a technology to convert them into pure hydrogen in an efficient and sustainable manner. Water is an ideal hydrogen source, and thus photocatalysts that could produce hydrogen from water splitting under sunlight have been actively sought [1–4]. Apart from water, H 2 S could become an alternative source of hydrogen. H 2 S is produced in large quantities as a byproduct in coal and petroleum industries, natural gas and oil wells, and geothermal plants [5,6]. In most cases, this toxic H 2 S has to be converted into an environmentally less harmful form to comply with environmental regulations. Thus, simultaneous hydrogen production and H 2 S decomposition is a highly desirable process that could satisfy both energy and environment requirements. From a fundamental point of view, the cleavage of H 2 S is easier than H 2 O requiring Δ G of only 39.4kJ/mol, which is much less than 284.7kJ/mol required for water splitting [8]. There has been a considerable work on photocatalytic hydrogen production from H 2 S dissolved in water or alkali solution [5–9]. The most favored photocatalyst is CdS by itself or as a mixture with other semiconductors such as TiO 2 , ZnS and SrTiO 3 . These semiconductor photocatalysts perform better when loaded with co-catalysts such as Pt or RuO 2 . The CdS-based photocatalysts are known to be the most active in hydrogen production from water. Unfortunately, they undergo severe photocorrosion under irradiation unless there exist hole scavengers in the solution (as sacrificial reagents) such as sulfides ( S 2 - ) and sulfites ( SO 3 2 - ) . When H 2 S is dissolved into alkaine solution, the sulfide ions are formed in situ and can play the role of a sacrificial reagent. Thus simultaneous hydrogen production and H 2 S decomposition from alkaline H 2 S solution could provide an opportunity for practical application of CdS-based photocatalysts maintaining high activity and stability. Here we designed and utilized a highly efficient CdS– TiO 2 nano-bulk composite (NBC) photocatalyst and measured the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from aqueous electrolyte solution containing H 2 S dissolved in water or alkali solution under visible light irradiation (using a cutoff filter of λ ⩾ 420 nm ). An isotope experiment was carried out with D 2 O instead of H 2 O to identify the source of hydrogen in photocatalytic decomposition of H 2 S dissolved in water or alkali solution. Such an identification of hydrogen source is helpful to ascertain the stability and efficiency of hydrogen production, as well as to understand the process of hydrogen production in a given system."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts The CdS photocatalysts were prepared by a precipitation method. A stoichiometric amount of Na 2 S aqueous solution was mixed drop-by-drop with Cd ( NO 3 ) 2 dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Precipitated powder was filtered and dried. The dried powder was calcined at 1073K for 3h under He flow to increase the crystallinity of CdS (CdS-1073K). As a reference material, we used commercial CdS powder (Aldrich). To fabricate CdS– TiO 2 nanocomposite photocatalysts, the calcined, bulky CdS was stirred in IPA and tetra-titanium isopropoxide (TTiP) (in a mole ratio of CdS to TTiP from 1 to 4), and H 2 O was added drop-by-drop. The prepared composite powder was filtered and dried again. The dried powder was calcined at 673K for 3h under air flow to increase the crystallinity of TiO 2 in CdS– TiO 2 composite photocatalysts. All procedures for catalyst preparation are schematically shown in Fig. 1 ."
3,Characterization of photocatalysts,"2.2 Characterization of photocatalysts The crystalline phases of the products were determined by X-ray diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu K α radiation at 40kV and 200mA. The optical properties were analyzed by UV-Visible diffuse reflectance (UV-DR) spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). The morphology of photocatalysts was investigated by a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010F, Field Emission Electron Microscope) instrument operated at 200kV. The chemical states of sulfur in the samples were determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS VG Scientific, ESCALAB 220iXL) using Mg K α radiation (1253.6eV). The binding energy calibration was performed using C1s peak in the background as the reference energy (284.6eV)."
4,Photocatalytic reaction and mechanism study,"2.3 Photocatalytic reaction and mechanism study To study hydrogen production from H 2 S solutions, the reaction solutions were prepared by dissolving H 2 S up to saturation in NaOH solution (0, 0.1, and 1M). The evolved amounts of H 2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier). The isotope experiment was performed to investigate the source of hydrogen formed from H 2 S -containing water. Thus, 70ml D 2 O was placed in a bubbler and purged with Ar gas at a flow rate of 30cc/min, 17mmol/s for 30min at room temperature. Then, 1M NaOH was dissolved into D 2 O and H 2 S gas was absorbed by flowing it through the solution at a constant rate (ca. 20cc/min, 14mmol/s) for 1h at room temperature. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out at room temperature with 0.1g CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 composite photocatalyst powders suspended by a magnetic stirrer and using an Hg-arc lamp (500W) equipped with a cutoff filter ( λ ⩾ 420 nm ). Before reaction, 1wt% of Pt was deposited on photocatalysts by photodeposition method under visible light ( λ ⩾ 420 nm ) [10]. The evolved gas was analyzed to determine the amount of H 2 , HD, and D 2 by quadrupole mass spectrometry."

6,Characterization of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst,"3.1 Characterization of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst The preparation and characterization procedures of CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 composite photocatalysts have been described elsewhere [11], and key physical properties are shown in Fig. 2 . The photocatalyst is made of highly crystalline bulk CdS particles decorated with the islands of TiO 2 nanoparticles. This configuration is termed “nano-bulk composite (NBC)”. It has been demonstrated that this particular configuration of the composite photocatalyst performs much better than other composite photocatalysts of different configurations, i.e. CdS nanoparticles/ TiO 2 nanoparticles or CdS nanoparticles/bulk TiO 2 [11]. The UV-DR spectrum of CdS/ TiO 2 composite photocatalyst showed that it maintained CdS and TiO 2 phases. Thus it looked like a simple combination of characteristics of two spectra (CdS and TiO 2 ) expected of a physical mixture of the two compounds (Fig. 2A). The single-phase, bulky CdS photocatalyst showed a sharp edge, while CdS (bulk)/ TiO 2 composite photocatalyst had two absorption edges; the main edge due to the sulfide at 550nm and second edge due to TiO 2 at 410nm. The XRD patterns were measured for CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 with NBC configuration (Fig. 2B). The crystallinity of CdS in CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 NBC photocatalyst was as good as the single phase CdS having hexagonal structure with a high crystallinity, considering its concentration (30wt%) in the composite. The TiO 2 phase was anatase in the composite photocatalyst. Fig. 2C shows the morphology of CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 NBC photocatalyst observed by high-resolution TEM. Large CdS particles of ca. 1 – 2 μ m size were decorated with TiO 2 nanoparticles of ca. 10 – 20 nm . The molar concentration of TiO 2 in CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 was 0.8. This corresponds to more than 10 times as much as the amount needed to cover 2 μ m CdS particles with a complete monolayer of 20nm TiO 2 particles. This indicates that TiO 2 nanoparticles tend to be deposited forming random multilayers over bulky CdS rather than the layer-by-layer deposition. The surface sulfur species was analyzed by XPS before photoreaction as shown in Fig. 3 . The S2p peaks indicated that CdS calcined at 1073K contained SO 4 2 - as an impurity as well as sulfide ( S 2 - ) species coming from the surface of bulk CdS, whereas CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 contained only sulfide ( S 2 - ) species. This surface oxidation may be responsible for the induction period for the single-component CdS photocatalysts as discussed previously [11]. In CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 catalyst, the surface oxidation of CdS appears to be suppressed due to protection by TiO 2 nanoparticles decorating the bulk CdS surface. TEM images in Fig. 2C were obtained for the samples before Pt loading and thus Pt particles are not seen. To investigate where the Pt co-catalysts are located, TEM images were obtained after Pt deposition. From TEM images and EDAX analysis, it was confirmed that Pt cocatalysts were randomly located on both nanosized TiO 2 (Fig. 4 B) and bulk CdS (Fig. 4C) particles."
7,Photocatalytic activity of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst As mentioned, the CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 NBC photocatalyst exhibited extremely high rates of hydrogen production from decomposition of water containing Na 2 S/ Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial agents under visible light ( λ ⩾ 420 nm ) as we reported elsewhere [11]. It was more active than the single component CdS catalyst and the composite catalyst of other configurations, i.e. nano-CdS/bulk TiO 2 or nano-CdS/nano- TiO 2 . As discussed there, the high photocatalytic activity of the NBC configuration of the composite photocatalyst could be attributed to two factors; (i) the hexagonal phase of CdS which is known for its high activity compared to the low-temperature cubic phase and (ii) the high crystallinity of the bulk CdS that would minimize the trapping of the photoelectrons. The sacrificial agents scavenge holes formed in the valence band of the CdS, and thus prevent photo-corrosion of CdS by the holes. In addition, they accelerate the hydrogen reduction reaction by photo-electrons formed in its conduction band. This is the standard procedure to test the photoactivity of sulfide photocatalysts in the laboratory. Yet, it has little practical value as it is because the sacrificial agents cannot be recycled. In H 2 S scrubbers used in industry, alkaline [12] or ethanolamine water [13] is used in order to increase the solubility of H 2 S by forming alkali metal sulfide ions. Note that the sulfide ions formed in situ could now play the role of sacrificial agents for hydrogen production with metal sulfide photocatalysts. Thus, in the present work, H 2 S was dissolved in NaOH solutions in order to evaluate the applicability of CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 NBC photocatalyst for a practical system, i.e. simultaneous hydrogen production and H 2 S decomposition. Fig. 5 shows evolution rates of H 2 from various electrolyte solutions over CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation (using a cutoff filter of λ ⩾ 420 nm ). The rates are average values for 3h of the reaction during which there was no change in the rate of H 2 evolution. The pH values of the electrolyte solutions are also indicated. High rates (597, 980 μ mol / h ) of hydrogen evolution were observed from H 2 S electrolyte dissolved in NaOH (0.1 and 1M). It should be noted that the initial rates of hydrogen production from H 2 S / 0.1 M NaOH / H 2 O are very similar to what was observed for the sacrificial agent system of H 2 O / 0.1 M Na 2 S / 0.02 M Na 2 SO 3 reported previously for the same catalyst [11]. The latter is the typical condition of water splitting experiments over sulfide photocatalysts with Na 2 S / Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial reagents. Apparently in the H 2 S / 0.1 M NaOH / H 2 O system, sulfide ion S 2 - is formed stoichiometrically in situ by reaction between H 2 S and NaOH: 2 NaOH + H 2 S ⇆ Na 2 S + 2 H 2 O , Na 2 S + H 2 S ⇆ 2 NaSH . The rates observed for 0.1M Na 2 S / 0.02 M Na 2 SO 3 aqueous electrolyte and H 2 S electrolyte dissolved in NaOH represent ca. 15.7% and 40.9% of the quantum yields ( 100 × the number of hydrogen atoms produced/number of absorbed photons) at λ ⩾ 420 nm , respectively. These values are comparable to those reported by Kudo [14] for Pt-loaded AgInZn 7 S 9 system, and higher than those of any other CdS– TiO 2 systems reported in the literature. In contrast, H 2 S dissolved in pure water showed an extremely low activity. When H 2 S is bubbled into pure water, the solubility is as high as ca. 0.1M at 298K, roughly equal to titrated alkaline solution. But the dissociation of H 2 S is severely limited as indicated by the pK value of 11.96 at 291K for the reaction of HS - ⇆ H + + S 2 - . Reber et al. reported influence of the solution pH on the activity of hydrogen production with S 2 - and SO 3 2 - as sacrificial reagents [10]. In solutions containing sulfide ions, the highest hydrogen production is observed near pH 12.8. But, Grätzel did not observe photoactivity below pH 11. In our experiments, an aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na 2 S + 0.02 M Na 2 SO 3 showed a pH value of 12.87. However, the H 2 S solution dissolved in pure water showed weak acidity of pH 4.05, and a poor performance. H 2 S dissolved in alkali solution showed neutral pH values (pH 7.02, 7.96), but they showed the high activity for hydrogen production. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5, the correlation between pH and the rates of H 2 evolution is not evident. The photoactivity increased markedly as NaOH concentration to dissolve H 2 S gas increased although the pH value of the solutions increased only slightly. This result is consistent with the results reported by Kots et al. [15]. Thus, we conclude from our results that the poor performance from H 2 S dissolved in pure water is due to the limited availability of S 2 - ions rather than the pH-dependent surface charge on the CdS particles. As inferred in other composite photocatalysts [16,17], the superior activity of the CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 composite photocatalyst is considered to be due to an efficient charge separation upon initial light absorption compared to CdS alone, caused by fast diffusion of photoelectrons generated in bulky CdS toward surrounding TiO 2 nanoparticles as schematically represented in Fig. 6 . The interface between bulk CdS and nano- TiO 2 shown as a TEM image in Fig. 6 provides the passage for the photoelectrons. The efficient charge separation leads to a lower probability of the energy-wasteful electron–hole recombination and thus to a higher efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction."
8,Mechanism of hydrogen production from photocatalytic decomposition of H2S,"3.3 Mechanism of hydrogen production from photocatalytic decomposition of H2S An isotope experiment was carried out with D 2 O instead of H 2 O to identify the source of hydrogen formed photocatalytically from a solution containing H 2 S dissolved in water or alkali solution under visible light. Fig. 7 A shows the mass spectrum of gases produced from H 2 S dissolved in H 2 O as the baseline case. Since there is no deuterium source, D 2 (4) was not produced and H 2 (2) gas was the only gas product. The small peak of mass number 3 probably came from the instrument background. Fig. 7B shows the results of an isotope experiment to investigate the source of hydrogen produced from H 2 S dissolved in D 2 O . The produced gas was mainly hydrogen in this case as well. Also, small amounts of D 2 (4) and HD(3) were formed. The solubility of H 2 S gas in H 2 O at room temperature and one atmosphere is 0.1mol per 1L. Now, if H 2 S gas has the same solubility in D 2 O as in H 2 O , its concentration in D 2 O is 0.007mol in 70ml D 2 O (ca. 2.92M). Thus, H 2 S dissolved in D 2 O existed in an environment populated predominately with deuterium. Yet, the produced gas was mainly H 2 (90%) derived from H 2 S . Therefore, it can be concluded that H 2 gas produced from H 2 S dissolved in D 2 O comes mainly from H 2 S (90%) and D 2 from D 2 O is a minor component (10%). An alkali solution is usually employed in industrial H 2 S scrubbers to enhance the solubility of H 2 S in water. A similar isotope experiment was performed to investigate hydrogen source from H 2 S dissolved in 1M NaOH/ D 2 O solution. As shown in Fig. 7C and Table 1 , the produced gas was mainly D 2 (4) and HD(3), while the amount of H 2 (2) was very small ( D 2 : HD : H 2 = 80 : 18.5 : 1.5 ). Thus, in H 2 S / NaOH / D 2 O system, the main hydrogen source (90%) come from D 2 O , although H 2 S also contributes substantially (10%). Considering the dominant presence of D 2 O in the solution relative to H 2 S (55.5:1), it can be concluded that, unlike in pure water, both H 2 S and D 2 O become hydrogen sources in H 2 S / NaOH / D 2 O system. For the hydrogen production from aqueous H 2 S solutions, two mechanisms have been proposed [12,13,18,19]. In the presence of a strong base, a hydroxyl ion reacts with H 2 S molecules to form a sulfide ion (1), which is oxidized by the photo-generated holes on the surface of the photocatalyst (2). The photoelectrons now reduce H 2 O to H 2 (3): (1) H 2 S + 2 OH - → S 2 - + 2 H 2 O , (2) S 2 - + 2 h + → S 0 , (3) 2 H 2 O + 2 e - → H 2 + 2 OH - . Because the water molecule in the reaction (3) could be the one formed from H 2 S via the reaction (1) or the one present initially in the reaction solution, this mechanism predicts both H 2 S and H 2 O as hydrogen sources. Note that the concentration of OH - is preserved by reactions (1) and (3). It is consistent with our isotope experiment results in the presence of NaOH. In the absence of the strong base, H 2 S dissociates to HS - and H + (4). The HS - is oxidized by holes to sulfur (5), while H + is reduced by photoelectrons to H 2 (6): (4) H 2 S → HS - + H + , (5) 2 h + + HS - → S 0 + H + , (6) 2 e - + 2 H + → H 2 . This mechanism predicts H 2 S as the sole source of hydrogen. Water could be involved through the reaction (6), but its effect should be insignificant due to the low concentration of proton in neutral water. The result is consistent with our isotope experiment results in the absence of NaOH."
9,Conclusion,"The CdS(bulk)/ TiO 2 composite photocatalyst was successfully fabricated by a precipitation method and sol–gel synthesis. This catalyst that had exhibited extremely high rates of hydrogen production from decomposition of water containing Na 2 S / Na 2 SO 3 as sacrificial agents, also showed very high activity of hydrogen production from a more practical system of H 2 S dissolved in NaOH solution. Thus it was confirmed that this new photocatalyst could be applied where simultaneous hydrogen production and H 2 S removal are desired, e.g. the treatment of Claus plant tail-gas stream or vents of hydrodesulfurization plants. The D 2 O isotope experiment was performed to identify the source of hydrogen formed by photocatalytic decomposition of H 2 S electrolyte solution dissolved in H 2 O and 1M NaOH solution. H 2 gas produced from H 2 S dissolved in pure H 2 O originates mainly from H 2 S , whereas H 2 gas produced from H 2 S electrolyte solution dissolved in aqueous NaOH comes from both H 2 O and H 2 S ."
