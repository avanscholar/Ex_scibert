0,Introduction,"Biohydrogen was produced from industrial wastewaters of sugar refinery [1], milk industry [2], tofu (soybean product) industry [3], lactic acid fermentation plant [4], and from sewage sludge [5] and municipal solid wastes [6]. Industrial effluent with high toxicity, conversely, is regarded as hazardous waste that needs decontamination before its disposal. Restated, toxins in industrial effluents often render biological processes unfit to convert its organic content into fuel. Various aromatic compounds, either of natural origin or of anthropogenic origin, are transformed or mineralized in various anaerobic environments [7,8]. The bacteria belonging to genus clostridium species has been noted to be able to degrade numerous aromatic compounds [9–12]. The clostridium species are hydrogen producers when degrading glucose (Table 1 ). Phenol is a toxic substance often found in industrial effluent [23]. This work investigated the potential for Clostridium butyricum to yield hydrogen from glucose in the presence of phenol of 200–1500mgL−1. Experimental data support the feasibility to harvest biohydrogen from phenol-containing wastewaters."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of inoculum,"2.1 Isolation of inoculum The sludge obtained at an animal waste treatment plant was suspended at pH 3, 37°C for 72h, and then at pH 2.0 at 4°C for another 12h. The seed sludge was mixed with medium (v/v 30:70) having the following compositions (gL−1) yeast extract, 2.0; glucose, 20.0; NH4Cl, 2.12; K2HPO4, 0.420; FeCl2, 0.180; CaCl22H2O, 0.375; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.312; KCl, 0.250; and NaHCO3, 8.0. The sludge-medium was anaerobically cultivated for 72h and the functional strains were isolated and purified and individually cultivated. In strain cultivation stage, hydrogen content ranged 50–65%. The DNA of strain was isolated (Adav et al., 2007) and the strain was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing using 11F (5′-GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-3′) and 1512R (5′ACG GCT ACC TTG TTA CGA CT 3′) as C. butyricum. The DNA was amplified using an eppendorf mastercycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) by denaturation at 94°C, 3min, 35 cycles consisting of 94°C for 30s, 54°C for 60s, 72°C for 90s, and final extension at 72°C for 7min. The PCR-amplified 16S rDNA was sequenced using the ABI Prism model 3730 (version 3.2) DNA sequencer."
3,Batch test,"2.2 Batch test The strain was tested for their capability to produce hydrogen in the presence of various concentration of phenol in batch tests. Batch tests were conducted in serum bottles with large headspace. The suspension volume (25ml) was relatively small compared with the headspace, hence minimizing possible inhibition effects of accumulated hydrogen on the strains [24]. The testing medium used had a composition of (gL−1) glucose, 5.0; yeast extract, 1.0; NH4Cl, 2.12; KH2PO4, 1.5; K2HPO4, 2.9; MgSO4, 0.031; FeCl3, 0.018; CaCl2, 0.037; KCl, 0.25; l-cystein, 0.5. A total of 128 serum bottles were sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and aluminum seal and were autoclaved for 15min. The sterilized bottles were cooled down and the headspace air was replaced by helium gas. The filter sterilized phenol was added with equal quantity of cultivated C. butyricum. These bottles were shaken in orbital shaker at 150rpm at 37°C with expanded gas removed using sterile needle. At each time interval and for each phenol concentrations, two serum bottles were arbitrarily chosen for test and their biogas volume, biogas composition, residual sugar concentration, phenol content, pH, and VFA were analyzed. After measurements, these bottles were disregarded. Control tests without phenol were conducted."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis Cell dry weight was measured according to the Standard Methods [25]. The residual glucose was quantified using 3,5 dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) method with glucose as the standard [26]. Gas production quantity was periodically measured using sterile syringes. The gas composition was measured by injecting 1ml of headspace gas using a gastight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) into a gas chromatography (Model GC-9A; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a TCD (thermal conductivity detector) and FID (flame ionization detector). Argon was the carrier gas. The volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols in filtered liquid samples were analyzed using a high pressure liquid chromatography (Ecom LCP 4100 Pump, C18 column, LCD 2083) with 25mM potassium phosphate (pH 2.3 adjusted by phosphoric acid) as the mobile phase of 1.0mlmin−1 flow rate."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogen production test,"3.1 Hydrogen production test Fig. 1 shows the hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield with glucose at various phenol concentrations. Hydrogen production rate of the enriched C. butyricum yielded hydrogen from glucose at 1.46±0.1molmol−1 glucose and at 42.6±8.1ml H2 L−1 h−1. With 200–400mgL−1 phenol, the hydrogen production rates revealed no statistically significant decline (p <0.001, ANOVA). At phenol concentration >1000mgL−1, C. butyricum showed a sudden drop in hydrogen productivity (0.56±0.62molmol−1 glucose and 11.7±0.1ml H2 L−1 h−1 at 1000mgL−1 phenol; p <0.001, ANOVA). With a phase lag of 6h, the present, enriched C. butyricum can degrade the dosed 5gL−1 glucose in the following 4h (Fig. 2 ). With 200–600mgL−1 phenol, most glucose was degraded in 6h following phase lag period. At >800mgL−1 phenol the glucose degradation was significantly declined. At 1500mgL−1 phenol no statistically noticeable quantity of glucose was degraded in a period of 20h test. The phenol had minimal effects on cell growth rates at phenol concentration <800mgL−1. At higher phenol concentrations, the cell growth was inhibited (Fig. 3 ). The C. butyricum can convert glucose to hydrogen in its growth phase in the presence of <800mgL−1 phenol, indicating the potential for converting easily degradable carbon sources in industrial effluent with highly toxic chemicals."
7,Co-degradation of phenol,"3.2 Co-degradation of phenol Co-degradation of phenol was observed in the tests. Over 20h testing time 67% of the 200mgL−1 dosed phenol and 34.8% of dosed 400mgL−1 phenol was removed (Fig. 4 ). At phenol concentration >600mgL−1, co-degradation phenomenon was not obvious (data not shown). Comparing with the residual glucose data in Fig. 2 and cell growth data in Fig. 3, co-degradation of phenol occurred at different patterns at 200 and 400mgL−1 with the strain C. butyricum. With low toxicity/low pH the enriched C. butyricum tended to utilize glucose first; while at medium toxicity/medium pH the strain tended to degrade phenol first. This characteristic is welcome in industrial effluent treatment since phenol can be early degraded to release stress on other trains in the community."
8,Fermentative metabolites,"3.3 Fermentative metabolites During fermentation, large quantities of VFAs were produced (Table 2 ), yielding a significant drop in suspension pH (Fig. 5 ). At pH <4.5 the hydrogen production was ceased. Ethanol and acetate were the primary metabolites, whose yields increased with increasing phenol concentration until phenol >1000–1200mgL−1 (Table 2). This observation correlates with the results by Ren et al. [24] when they fermented MN301 cellulose, Avicel and cellobiose using four of the six tested mesophilic clostridia (Clostridium cellulolyticum, Clostridium cellobioparum, Clostridium celerecrescens and Clostridium phytofermentans). Formate was produced in significant quantity at 400mgL−1 phenol test (mgL−1), which may be contributed by the metabolites from phenol degradation. Production of propionate and butyrate was minimal. At phenol concentration of 1000–1200mgL−1 the strain was still effective to utilize glucose as substrate, but produced low net hydrogen (Fig. 1). Peaks on the HPLC spectrograph corresponding to 6-C compounds were noticeable in the 200 and 400mgL−1 phenol tests. Very likely these compounds were metabolites from phenol rather than from glucose. No inhibitory effects were observed for these metabolites on hydrogen production (Fig. 1)."
9,Harvest hydrogen from toxic wastewaters,"3.4 Harvest hydrogen from toxic wastewaters Results presented herein revealed the potential to harvest hydrogen from a toxic industrial effluent. The enriched clostridium strain yielded hydrogen at approximately 1.4molmol−1 glucose with up to 400mgL−1 phenol, comparable to other batch studies using glucose as the sole carbon source. Removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) ranged 30–40% at phenol <600mgL−1, or about 10% at 1200mgL−1 phenol (Fig. 6 ). Mineralization of the organic substance is not sufficiently high, leaving room for a subsequent unit to produce valuable chemicals using the residual COD in the effluent. The noted co-degradation of phenol (Fig. 4) is welcome since the strain can achieve partial decontamination of the wastewater and reduction of phenol toxicity to other hydrogen-producing strains."
10,Conclusions,"Dark fermentation hydrogen production from glucose using strain C. butyricum with 200–1500mgL−1 phenol was investigated. The adopted C. butyricum strain yielded hydrogen from glucose at 1.46±0.1molmol−1 glucose, and remained so with 200–400mgL−1 phenol. Serious inhibition on cell activity was noted at phenol concentration >1000mgL−1. During 20h fermentation 67% of the 200mgL−1 dosed phenol and 34.8% of dosed 400mgL−1 phenol was degraded. The major metabolites were ethanol and acetate, followed by formate. The production VFA reduced suspension pH to below 4.4, and ceased hydrogen production. Although toxic industrial wastewaters are normally considered as a dangerous waste rather than a resource, the present work revealed the possibility to harvest hydrogen with enriched selected strain under favorable environment."
