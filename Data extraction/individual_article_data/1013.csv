0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) generation from electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for renewable and clean energy, which overcomes energy and environmental issues caused by fossil fuels [1–3]. However, the thermodynamically unfavorable four-electron redox process of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) normally requires a high overpotential to drive the overall water splitting [4,5]. Moreover, the oxygen product is actually not of high value owing to its high energy consumption and facile obtainability from air. Alternatively, substitution of sluggish OER with a thermodynamically more favorable organic oxidation reaction to achieve electrochemical hydrogen-evolution coupled with selective oxidation (EHCO) is more attractive, which is promising to address the above energy utilization efficiency and obtain valuable commodity chemicals [6,7]. However, how to achieve a high conversion efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical organic oxidation remains a challenge, owing to the interference of side-reaction (oxygen evolution). Biomass oxidation into fine chemicals through direct utilization of renewable electricity under ambient temperature and pressure is attractive for biomass upgrading. As a typical example, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the most important biomass-platform molecules because of the broad application of its oxidation derivatives (such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)) [8–10]. However, a high reaction potential is still needed for the electrochemical oxidation of HMF, causing inevitable competition of OER that seriously reduces the efficiency of whole reaction. To overcome this issue, various electrocatalysts have been developed for HMF oxidation to produce FDCA, such as hydroxides, sulfides and phosphides [11–15]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), as typical layered materials that consist of positively charged host layers and charge compensating interlayer anions, have been proven to be an efficient candidate for small molecules oxidation, such as water, methanol, ethanol as well as HMF [16–19]. Especially, LDHs have been recognized as one of the state-of-the-art nonprecious catalysts for OER due to their unique structural features and electronic properties [20,21]. This leads to a competition between water oxidation and organic oxidation when LDHs serve as electrocatalysts in aqueous media. This inspires us to further boost HMF oxidation while inhibit water oxidation via synergistically regulating the electronic structure and surface properties of LDHs electrocatalyst, for the purpose of attaining highly-efficient biomass oxidation and hydrogen production. Besides, previous works have proven that exfoliating LDHs into few-&mono-layered structure is efficient to maximize the exposure of reactive sites in LDHs to optimize the electrocatalytic performance [22–24]. However, in practical application, the exfoliated LDHs nanosheets are easy to be reaggregated on the electrode, causing the embedding of reactive sites, and thus largely reduces the resulting electrochemical performances. Constructing LDHs nanoarray on conductive substrates is efficient to promote the exposure of reactive sites and improve the stability of LDHs, but it is still a challenge to obtain few-&mono-layer LDHs nanosheet array directly up to date. Herein, we report a self-supported ultrathin LDHs nanosheet array (NSA) by using in-situ electrochemical exfoliation method, which gives simultaneously regulated electronic structure and enhanced active surface area towards highly-efficient EHCO process. As a typical example, we successfully accomplish the exfoliation of bulk CoAl-LDH NSA into ultrathin NSA structure with the thickness decreasing from ~30 to ~2.9 nm (denoted as E-CoAl-LDH-NSA). Moreover, the in-situ exfoliation strategy introduces abundant oxygen vacancies on the CoAl-LDH, which regulates the electronic structure of LDHs and facilitates the adsorption and oxidation process of HMF, as proved by experiments studies (EPR, XPS, EXAFS and in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy) as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculation. As a result, the ultrathin CoAl-LDH NSAs exhibits outstanding performance for the oxidation of HMF to FDCA with a low potential of 1.30 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 as well as much high FE for FDCA (99.4%) even at 1.52 V vs. RHE, which is the highest level of high potentials (> 1.50 V) compared with reported electrocatalysts. In addition, a two-electrode cell was assembled based on the LDHs NSA towards HMF oxidation coupled hydrogen generation, taking the advantages of low voltage (1.74 V to reach 50 mA cm−2), high H2 yield of 44.16 L h−1 m−2 (4 times higher than overall water splitting) as well as excellent stability."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA,"2.1 Preparation of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA The bulk CoAl-LDH nanosheets array was prepared via a hydrothermal method. Typically, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1.5 mM/0.09 mmol), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.75 mM/0.045 mmol), NH4F (8 mM/0.48 mmol) and urea (35 mM/2.1 mmol) were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. The Ni foam was cleaned with diluted hydrochloric acid, acetone, ethanol and deionized water in a super sonic bath for 15 min respectively to remove the oxides and oil on the surface of Ni foam. The solution and a piece of Ni foam with the size of 3 cm × 5 cm were transferred into an 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave sealed, and maintained at 90 °C for 6 h. Then the hybrid substrate was collected and cleaned with ethanol and deionized water and dried at 60 °C."
3,Preparation of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA,"2.2 Preparation of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA E-CoAl-LDH-NSA was synthesized through an electrochemical intercalation. Typically, the coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box using B-CoAl-LDH-NSA as the anode, Li disk (12 mm in diameter; 0.45 mm in thickness) as the cathode. The separator is was bought from Celgard and the electrolyte was 1 M LiTFSI DOL/DME (1:1 by volume) with 1 wt% LiNO3 as the additive. The Li deposition process was performed using galvanostatic discharge at current of 0.5 mA with 12 h on a LAND electrochemical testing system at room temperature, which is denoted as E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. After the discharge process, the Li metal-intercalated B-CoAl-LDH-NSA was extracted from the cell and immersed in alcohols to remove the electrolyte and complete the exfoliation process. The violent reaction between lithium and alcohol can produce huge amounts of H2 and C2H5OLi in an instant, which realize the exfoliation of LDHs by H2 and the formation of vacancies by the etching of C2H5OLi. Then the as-obtained E-CoAl-LDH-NSA was cleaned with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for further characterizations and tests."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The morphology of the samples was investigated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Zeiss SUPRA 55) under an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were captured on a Philips Tecnai 20 and JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscopes under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The thickness of LDHs was recorded on atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker, Dimension FastScan) with the tapping mode. The atomic-resolution high angle annular dark-feld scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector worked at 300 kV. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using a Cu Kα source, with a scan step of 10° min−1 and a scan range between 3° and 70°. FTIR spectra were recorded on a NICOLET NEXUS470 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer at a pressure of about 2 × 10−9 Pa using Al Kα X-rays as the excitation source. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected on spectrometer (Bruker ENX-500) with 9.53 GHz X-band at room temperature to investigate oxygen vacancies in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. The Co XAFS measurements were performed at the beamline 1W1B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The typical energy of the storage ring was 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA and the hard X-ray was monochromatized with Si (111) double-crystals. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) were recorded at ambient temperature in fluorescence mode and transformed without phase correction."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural and morphological characterizations,"3.1 Structural and morphological characterizations The in-situ electrochemical exfoliation of LDHs NSAs is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a, which include the intercalation of Li-metal in the LDHs nanosheets, followed by a subsequent exfoliation process in ethanol (see details in Fig. S1). Fig. 1b displays the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the as-obtained bulk CoAl-LDH NSA (denoted as B-CoAl-LDH-NSA), from which uniform nanoplatelets with diameter of 1–2 µm and thickness of about 30 nm are observed. Fig. 1c shows that the ordered perpendicular nanoarray structure of CoAl-LDH is well maintained after exfoliation while the thickness significantly decreases to 2.9 nm, which is confirmed by the atomic force microscopy images (AFM; Fig. 1d). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figs. 1e and S2 further confirm the ultrathin nature of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. Moreover, the EDX mapping results (Figs. 1e and S3) show that Co, Al and O element are homogeneously distributed on the surface of both CoAl-LDH samples (Table S1). The crystal structures and defects of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA at the atomic scale was further investigated by the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HADDF-STEM). As shown in Figs. 1f and S4, the HRTEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of both B-CoAl-LDH-NSA and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA display an interplanar distance of ~0.26 nm, corresponding to the (012) plane of the LDHs phase. The HADDF-STEM images in Fig. 1g give the direct view of the (012) plane of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. Moreover, multiple atom defects were also clearly identified in the HADDF-STEM image of the ultrathin CoAl-LDH nanosheet, further confirming the introduced vacancies in the LDHs by in-situ exfoliation. To better understand the in-situ exfoliation process and mechanism, we investigated the morphology of CoAl-LDH-NSA with different deposition times. Fig. S6a displays typical discharge curve of CoAl-LDH-NSA during Li deposition at the current density of 0.5 mA. The morphology changes of CoAl-LDH-NSA after different discharge times were also schematic illustrated in Fig. S6a. The voltage of the cell decreases gradually to the potential around 0 V at the first stage (0–2 h), which corresponds to the insertion of Li ions in CoAl-LDH [25–27]. Then, the Li ions was gradually reduced into Li metal and deposited in the interlayer or on the surface of CoAl-LDH. Firstly, there was no morphology change for the B-CoAl-LDH-NSA when it was just let stand in the Li-metal battery for 24 h and then immersed in ethanol (Fig. S5). After 2 h of discharge (corresponding to the Li ion insertion process) and then immersed in ethanol, the morphology of CoAl-LDH-NSA still remained unchanged (Fig. S6b and f). Afterwards, Li cations are gradually reduced into metallic Li and deposited in the interlayer or on the surface of CoAl-LDH and the thickness of CoAl-LDH nanosheets becomes thinner along with the increase of deposition time. However, the NSA structure is destroyed when the discharge time is extended to 18 h (Fig. S6e and i). The violent reaction between Li metal (but not Li ions) and alcohol can produce huge amounts of H2 and C2H5OLi in an instant, which realize the exfoliation of LDHs by H2 and the formation of vacancies by the etching of C2H5OLi. Noted that the CoAl-LDH can be exfoliated in various alcohols, including ethanol, methanol, glycol and glycerol due to the facile reaction of Li metal with these alcohols (Fig. S7). Moreover, the in-situ exfoliation of CoAl-LDH-NSA can be successfully realized on different conductive substrates (e.g., Ti fiber paper and Cu foam; Fig. S8). X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA shows clear (003) and (012) reflections at 11.5° and 34.3° ( Fig. 2a), assigned to carbonate ions (CO3 2−)-intercalated LDHs phase [28,29]. The sharp diffraction peaks at 44.5° and 51.8° can be assigned to the (111) and (200) reflections of Ni foam substrate. As for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA, the (003) and (012) diffraction peaks disappear, implying the successfully exfoliation of LDHs. This is also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2b, the FT-IR spectra of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA shows clear interlayer CO3 2− bands at 750 cm−1 and 1350 cm−1, while these bands are absent in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA [30]. The elemental composition and structure changes of CoAl-LDH-NSAs before and after exfoliation were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2c, the full XPS spectra of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA reveal signals of Co, O, C and Al elements. The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2d) show that the B-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits characteristic Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 peaks located at 781.7 and 797.7 eV, indicating the existence of Co2+. However, the peaks shift to lower binding energy for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA (780.9 eV and 796.4 eV for Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 peaks), demonstrating the exfoliation process lowers the valence state of Co species [31]. Meanwhile, we found that the signal of Al 2p was significantly reduced and atomic ratio of Al element on the surface of LDH was reduced from 4.96% to 0.37% (Fig. S9). This can be ascribed to the etching of amphoteric Al species by alkaline alkoxide species generated in the exfoliation process [32,33]. Moreover, the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA (Fig. 2e) gives three peaks: the lattice oxygen (such as M−O, Co−M; 529.7 eV), the lattice OH group (MOH; 531.6 eV), and the surface adsorbed H2O (H2O 532.6 eV). The O 1s XPS spectra of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibit a new peak for defects with low oxygen coordination (Ovac) at 531.1 eV and the peaks for lattice oxygen (MO) disappeared, demonstrating the introduction of oxygen vacancies into LDHs through the exfoliation process [34,35]. We further used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to study the oxygen defects in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. As shown in Fig. 2f, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA presents a strong EPR signal at g = 2.002 compared to B-CoAl-LDH-NSA, further illustrating the formation of oxygen vacancy in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA [36,37]. We employed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to explore the local atomic arrangements of CoAl-LDH-NAS before and after exfoliation. Fig. 2g shows the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA, which reflects the difference in the surface atomic structures of Co. The Co K-edge XANES spectra of two samples show similar photon energy peaks at ∼ 7728 eV, while the white line intensity for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA is lower than that of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA, indicating a higher electron density of Co species in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA [31]. The corresponding Co K-edge k 3χ(k) oscillation curve of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA reveals a decrease in the amplitude compared to B-CoAl-LDH-NSA (Fig. 2h), suggesting a variation of the coordination environment of Co atoms [38]. This is confirmed by the Fourier transformed (FT) k 3χ(k) functions. As shown in Fig. 2i, the FT k 3χ(k)-R space curves for both the B-CoAl-LDH-NSA and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA show two main peaks at 1.547 Å and 1.625 Å, corresponding to the CoO and CoM (M = Co, Al) coordination [39]. The fitting results (Fig. S10 and Table S2) of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA show that the CoO distance in the first shell is 2.060 Å, which is smaller than that of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA (2.086 Å). The coordination number of CoO decreases from 4.2 (B-CoAl-LDH-NSA) to 3.7 (E-CoAl-LDH-NSA), indicating the fine structure change of CoO and the presence of oxygen vacancies in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. Furthermore, the greater Debye–Waller factor of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA reveals a more disordered structure around the Co atom, in comparison with B-CoAl-LDH-NSA. The results above confirm that the in-situ exfoliation not only decreases the thickness of CoAl-LDH-NSA, but also induces oxygen vacancies in E-CoAl-LDH-NSA, which significantly changes the electronic structure of LDHs and enhances the exposure of reactive sites."
7,Electrochemical oxidation of HMF and reaction mechanism over E-CoAl-LDH-NSA catalysts,"3.2 Electrochemical oxidation of HMF and reaction mechanism over E-CoAl-LDH-NSA catalysts The OER and HMF electrooxidation performances of the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA and B-CoAl-LDH-NSA were evaluated in a standard three electrodes system. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves ( Figs. 3a and S11) show that the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits an onset potential of 1.57 V vs. RHE for OER in 1 M KOH, much lower than that of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA (1.63 V). After adding 10 mM HMF into the electrolyte, the onset potential of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA shifts to 1.30 V vs. RHE and the oxidation potential decreases markedly from 1.69 to 1.59 V vs. RHE at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b). This is attributed to the lower reaction energy barrier of HMF oxidation than OER as well as the excellent activities of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA for HMF oxidation. Although the reaction potential of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA also decreases for HMF oxidation and OER, it still needs a high potential of 1.40 and 1.71 V vs. RHE to reach 10 and 100 mA cm−2 respectively (Fig. 3a, b). The Tafel slope of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA for OER and HMF oxidation are determined to be 70.54 and 76.67 mV dec−1 respectively, much lower than those of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA (82.65 and 87.42 mV dec−1), indicating the better kinetic profile for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the HMF oxidation performance of CoAl-LDH-NSAs with different Li deposition time were also studied. As shown in Fig. S12, the anodic current of CoAl-LDH-NSA for HMF oxidation enhances gradually as the Li-discharge time increases from 0 to 12 h. While the current declines sharply for the CoAl-LDH with the deposition time extended to 18 h due to the structure destruction. The electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA) and EIS test of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA and B-CoAl-LDH-NSA were also conducted. As shown in Fig. S13, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits higher ECSA than B-CoAl-LDH-NSA by plotting the current difference against the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry, indicating more exposed active sites by the exfoliation. We further analyzed the products of HMF oxidation over E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. Chronoamperometric measurements were carried out in 1 M KOH with 10 mM HMF at 1.52 V vs. RHE and the concentrations of reactant and products during the oxidation process were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As shown Figs. 3d and S14, HMF is gradually consumed in the electrooxidation process accompanied with the production of FDCA. Moreover, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 5-Formylfuran-2-carboxylic acid (FFCA) were also detected in this process while 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde(DFF) was not found. This demonstrates that the reaction path is the preferential oxidation of aldehyde groups in HMF to form HMFCA, in constant with the literatures [18]. Then, the HMFCA is oxidized to FFCA and finally FDCA. After consuming 59.1 C of charge, HMF totally transformed into FDCA with a high FE of 99.4%. We also explored the FE of FDCA under different applied potentials. As shown in Fig. 3e, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits high oxidation efficiency in a wide potential window from 1.42 to 1.57 V vs. RHE with the FE of FDCA above 95%, which is superior to the reported LDHs electrocatalysts as well as most of other transition metal catalysts (Table S3). Moreover, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits excellent robustness for HMF oxidation after seven successive cycles at 1.52 V vs. RHE: its structure remains unchanged (Fig. S15) and FE maintains above 95% (Fig. 3f). We also evaluated the durability of the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA towards OER. As shown in Fig. S16, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits good stability after 110 h of OER test at 10 mA cm−2 and no obvious morphological change was observed. The oxidation process of HMF was also studied by using 18O isotope labeling method. The experiment was operated in 1 M KOH with 10 mM HMF and 18O labeled water (H2 18O) under the potential with the highest FE (1.52 V vs. RHE.) As shown in Fig. 3g, the mass spectrum of oxidation products displays three peaks at m/z of 154.99, 157.00 and 159.01, corresponding to FDCA labeled with all 16O atoms, one 18O atom and two 18O atom, indicating the water serves not only as solvent but also as O source for HMF oxidation [40]. Furthermore, two main peaks at m/z of 139.04 and 141.05 are assigned to FFCA and FFCA with one 18O atom; and the peak at m/z of 143.02 represents the HMFCA with one 18O atom. The results verify a clear reaction mechanism of HMF oxidation as follows (Fig. 3h). Firstly, H2O molecule undergoes addition to the aldehyde of HMF (Step 1), followed by the dehydrogenation reaction (Step 2). As confirmed by the mass spectrum, only one oxygen atom is added to HMF during this process. Subsequently, HMFCA transforms into FFCA through the dehydrogenation reaction of hydroxymethyl (Step 3). Finally, another H2O molecule is added to the aldehyde of FFCA (Step 4) with the following dehydrogenation reaction (Step 5), resulting in the formation of the final product (FDCA) with 2 labeled 18O atoms. To further understand the reaction kinetics of the electrooxidation of HMF over E-CoAl-LDH-NSA and B-CoAl-LDH-NSA, in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted under different applied potentials. Fig. S17a shows the Nyquist plots of two electrodes in 1 M KOH with 100 mM HMF at the potential of 1.42 V vs. RHE. The smaller diameter of the semicircle indicates a faster charge transfer and better electronic conductivity for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA [11,41]. As shown in Fig. S17b. With the absence of HMF, the Nyquist plot of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA is nearly a vertical line in 1 M KOH, indicating a huge charge transfer resistance without electrochemical reaction. In contrast, after the addition of 100 mM HMF, a semicircle is observed in the Nyquist plot for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA, which suggests a decreased charge transfer resistance due to the HMF oxidation at the potential of 1.42 V vs. RHE [15]. Moreover, the in-situ EIS of two electrodes under different potentials for OER and HMF oxidation was performed. As shown in Fig. S17c, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits high charge transfer resistance within potential window 1.12 V–1.52 V vs. RHE and the resistance sharply reduces at 1.57 V vs. RHE, indicating the occurrence of OER at this potential. After adding 100 mM HMF, the saltation of charge transfer resistance appears as the potential increases to 1.27 V vs. RHE (Fig. S17d), corresponding to the HMF oxidation. Thus, the as-obtained E-CoAl-LDH-NSA displays an excellent selectivity towards HMF oxidation other than OER in a wide potential range (1.27 V–1.57 V vs. RHE), which is consistent with the LSV curves and the products analysis based on HPLC results. It is worth mention that the HMF oxidation occurs at a higher potential of 1.37 V vs. RHE for the B-CoAl-LDH-NSA (Fig. S17f) in comparison with E-CoAl-LDH-NSA, furtherly demonstrating the promoted electrocatalytic activity of the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. It has been reported that oxygen vacancies play a key role in activation adsorption of oxygen-containing molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, NO and benzyl alcohol) [42–46]. Thus, the open circuit potential (OCP) tests and in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy were performed to study the HMF adsorption on the two electrodes and the impacts of oxygen vacancies. As shown in Fig. 4a, the OCP of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA decreases significantly by 152 mV, in comparison with a 50 mV decrease for B-CoAl-LDH-NSA, indicating a stronger adsorption of HMF on the surface of E-CoAl-LDH-NSA [7]. As for the in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy, pure HMF was flowed directly into the in-situ cell at 150 °C for 15 min and He gas was flowed subsequently to remove the physically-adsorbed HMF. Afterwards, the cell was cooled down to 25 °C and the FT-IR spectra of these two catalysts was recorded at this temperature. In Fig. 4b, two strong bands are found at 1674 and 1523 cm−1 for the pure HMF, which are ascribed to the stretching vibration of CO bond (νC O) of aldehyde group and CC bond (νC C) of furan ring [47]. For the adsorption of HMF on E-CoAl-LDH-NSA, an obvious red shift from 1674 to 1640 cm−1 for νC O and from 1523 to 1516 cm−1 for νC C are observed, illustrating the strong chemical adsorption of HMF on E-CoAl-LDH-NSA [48]. In contrast, a slight red shift of these two bands on B-CoAl-LDH-NSA confirms a weak adsorption of HMF on B-CoAl-LDH-NSA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk LDHs (B-CoAl-LDH-NSA) and ultrathin LDHs with oxygen vacancies (E-CoAl-LDH-NSA) to further reveal the influence of oxygen vacancies on HMF oxidation. The total density of states (TDOS) of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA are displayed in Fig. 4c. The bandgap between the conduction band and valance band is ∼ 1.36 eV; and the density of states within the band gap for E-CoAl-LDH-NSA increase signiﬁcantly, indicating an enhanced electric conductivity resulting from the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which is consistent with the EIS result (Fig. S17a). The adsorption energies of HMF on B-CoAl-LDH-NSA and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA are calculated to be −0.91 and −1.02 eV (Fig. 4d), suggesting a stronger interaction between HMF and E-CoAl-LDH-NSA. Fig. 4e is the standard free energy diagram of HMF oxidation on two electrodes. The rate-determining step for HMF oxidation is the dehydrogenation of HMFCA to FFCA, whose energy barrier is calculated to be 0.216 eV (B-CoAl-LDH-NSA) vs. 0.140 eV (E-CoAl-LDH-NSA). This indicates that the introduction of oxygen vacancies on LDHs effectively facilitates the activation adsorption of HMF molecules and decreases the energy barrier of rate-determining step, in accordance with the experimental results. To successfully achieve the coupling of HMF oxidation and hydrogen production, we evaluated the HER performance of the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA in a three-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. S18, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA exhibits enhanced HER performance with an overpotential of 0.16 V vs. RHE to reach 10 mA cm−2 (0.23 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 for B-CoAl-LDH-NSA) and robust stability (steady over 110 h at 10 mA cm−2, Fig. S19). When the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA is used as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode cell, a voltage of 1.74 V is needed to reach 50 mA cm−2 for HMF oxidation coupling H2 production, much lower than that of B-CoAl-LDH-NSA assembled cell (1.92 V, Fig. 5a). Moreover, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA assembled cell gives high Faradaic efficiencies (FE) after eight cycles at 1.70 V with 99.1% and 95.8% for FDCA and H2 production respectively, demonstrating a good stability (Figs. 5b and S20). The yield of H2 and FDCA of the two-electrode configuration were also quantified. As shown in Fig. 5c, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA assembled cell exhibits a H2 yield of 44.16 L h−1 m−2 under a constant cell voltage of 1.80 V for HMF oxidation (HMFOR) coupled with HER system, which is 4 times larger than that of OER coupled HER (11.32 L h−1 m−2). In addition, the HMFOR-HER system produces FDCA with a high yield of 63.38 g h−1 m−2; whilst no high-value-added chemical is collected for OER-HER system. Furthermore, we successfully separated the FDCA from the electrolyte and obtained the nearly white powder products. The purity(weight ratio) of the isolated FDCA product was detected by HPLC and calculated to be 99.45% (Fig. 5d). The 1H NMR result further confirmed the high purity of the as-obtained FDCA powder product (Fig. 5e). Besides, we also studied the generality of biomass oxidation coupled with H2 production over E-CoAl-LDH-NSA catalyst. As shown in Table S4, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA coupled system can effectively achieve efficient conversion of biomass (Furfural, 5-Methylfurfural, 5-Chlorofurfural, 5-Bromofurfural and Glycerol) with high conversion and FE (> 90%) at the potential of 1.70 V in the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA coupled cell, demonstrating the universality of organic oxidation based on E-CoAl-LDH-NSA electrocatalyst. Therefore, the E-CoAl-LDH-NSA is capable for co-production of value-added chemicals and H2 with excellent efficiency and durability, which holds promise for water splitting coupled with synthesis of fine chemicals."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, an ultrathin CoAl-LDH nanosheet array has been synthesized via an in-situ exfoliation strategy towards efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF into FDCA coupled with H2 production. Benefiting from significantly enhanced electrochemical surface area and abundant oxygen vacancies, the ultrathin E-CoAl-LDH-NSA shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for HMF oxidation with a low onset potential of 1.30 V vs. RHE and a high FE of over 95% in a wide potential window from 1.42 V to 1.57 V vs. RHE. The introduction of oxygen vacancies effectively optimizes the adsorption and oxidation process of HMF on the surface of LDHs, which is proved by both experimental studies and DFT calculations. Moreover, the CoAl-LDH-NSA displays a highly enhanced H2 and FDCA yield in two-electrode cells with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency and robust stability for both H2 and FDCA production. The strategy reported here is promising for the design of electrocatalysts towards commodity chemicals generation couple with the hydrogen evolution."
