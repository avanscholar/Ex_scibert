0,Introduction,"The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has been increasing due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas since the industrial revolution [1–5]. Recently, the concentration has rapidly increased, as shown in Table 1 , leading to the fear of global warming. These increases in CO2 continue despite the efforts of many nations to decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration as discussed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992 and Conference of the Parties 1 (COP1) in 1995 in Berlin, Germany. Recently, the use of hydrogen for energy has attracted attention as way to avoid global warming. This is because hydrogen can be burned to produce energy, but its combustion yields only water without emitting carbon dioxide. Compressed hydrogen has been used in fuel cells on vehicles to generate electricity to drive motors using oxygen from the air. In Japan, Toyota already began selling a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) called “MIRAI” in 2014, and Honda also followed with “CLARITY FUEL CELL” in 2016 [6]. They are expected to replace traditional gasoline-engine cars and will be used widely in the near future. Currently, approximately 96% of the worldwide production of hydrogen is a result of steam reforming of natural gas, oil or coal, and the major uses of produced hydrogen are in petroleum refining and production of ammonia for fertilizers [7–11]. Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in a very wide hydrogen concentration range of 4–74% [12]. Explosive reactions may be triggered by a spark, heat or sunlight. Therefore, safe storage and transportation of hydrogen is of grave importance. Methylcyclohexane (MCH) is used as the medium for both storage and transportation of hydrogen. The methylcyclohexane is dehydrogenated with a platinum-alumina catalysts under at 400 °C to produce hydrogen as shown in Eq. (1) [13]. The methylcyclohexane is stored under with 1/500 volume of hydrogen in standard temperature and pressure as shown in Eq. (2). (1) (2) Formic acid is also used as a medium for both storage and transportation of hydrogen, similarly to methylcyclohexane as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4) [14]. (3) (4) Image 6 The author has published papers, reviews [1f,15] and monographs [16] on the five-membered ring products of cyclometalation reactions since the first paper was published in 1966 [17]. When cyclometalation reactions are performed using metal compounds with substrates that contain heteroatoms with a strong donor ability, such as amines, phosphines, alcohols and sulfur compounds, the reactions show high reactivity of the substrate to the metal compounds because the compounds with these heteroatoms are usually used as catalysts. Therefore, various articles, many reviews [15] and books [16] on this subject have been published since the 1960s, and cyclometalation reactions are considered representative reactions in organic synthesis. Commonly, cyclometalation reactions with conventional substrates that have a γ-carbon atom as the heteroatom proceed very easily via agnostic interactions with CH activation, as shown in Eq. (5) [15p]. Then, the metal atom is coordinated by the heteroatom and becomes the active center in the five-membered ring products. Many compounds easily afford their derivatives from reactions such as alkylation, alkenylation, alkynylation, carbonylation, isocyanation, halogenation, chiral reactions with amino acids, enantioselective rearrangement, asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions and dehydrogenation [15m,15n,15u]. (5) Various five-membered ring products of cyclometalation reactions are synthesized with all types of combinations of substrates with heteroatoms, conventional substrates, unconventional substrates, ancillary ligands, metal atoms and metal compounds, which are coordinated by a heteroatom and many ligand groups are used as catalyst [15m,15n,15u] and in the fields of OLED [15s], pharmaceuticals [15q], CO2 utilization [15v], dye-sensitizer solar cells [15t] and sensors [15w]. This review mainly describes the photosensitizing actions of the cyclometalated five-membered ring iridium products for hydrogen production. The utilized cyclometalated five-membered ring products are 2-phenylpyridine iridium compounds, 2-phenylpyridine iridium derivatives, other cyclometalated iridium compounds such as 2-phenylbenzothiasoles, 2-thienylpyridine compounds, CNC pincer compounds and other cyclometalated pincer compounds with different metal centers such as palladium, gold, platinum and ruthenium. Furthermore, cyclometalated 1-phenylpyrazole iridium compounds are also used for preparing catalysts to generate hydrogen."
1,2-Phenylpyridine cyclometalated iridium compounds,"In the application of the five-membered ring products of cyclometalation reactions for hydrogen production, 2-phenylpyridine iridium compounds are used as photosensitizers in conjunction with sacrificial electron donors such as triethylamine (TEA) and triethanolamine (TEOA) and water reduction catalysts such as cobalt, rhodium and ruthenium chelate compounds. For example, the immobilization of a cyclometalated iridium photosensitizer (PS), [bis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium 2,2’-bipyridine]+ ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+) 2.1, with a water reduction catalyst (WRC), tris(2,2’-bipyridyl)rhodium(III) ([Rh(bpy)3]3+) 2.2 and sacrificial electron donor, triethylamine (TEA), onto layered niobate (K4Nb6O17) nanosheets was carried out with the aim of developing a photocatalyst for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. The recovered photocatalyst can be repeatedly recycled without deterioration of its catalytic activity. Moreover, the use of exfoliated K4Nb6O17 nanosheets has been proven to significantly enhance photocatalytic activity, presumably because of their increase in accessibility. Photocatalytic hydrogen production in 10% MeCN-H2O solution with 0.6 M TEA using the above Ir-Rh/K4Nb6O17 nanosheet (Ir: Rh = 1: 1) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) for 4 h produces approximately 60 μmol of hydrogen [18]. Image 8 The intercalation of cyclometalated iridium compound (III) ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ 2.1 with a rhodium (III) complex ([Rh(bpy)3]3+ 2.2) into a layered zirconium phosphate (Zr(HPO4)2·H2O) having an interlayer distance of 10.3 Å and triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor, was carried out with the aim of developing a visible-light responding photocatalyst for H2 production in aqueous media. Photocatalytic H2 production in 90% H2O-acetonitrile with a 0.6 M solution of the sacrificial electron donor of TEA using Ir-Rh/Zr (Zr(HPO4)2·H2O) (Ir: Rh = 1: 1) as the catalyst for 4 h produces approximately 120 μmol of hydrogen. After investigating the influence of the molar ratio of photosensitizer Ir compound 2.1 and proton reduction catalyst Rh complex 2.2 within the layered zirconium phosphate (Zr(HPO4)2·H2O), the maximal turnover number (TON) was obtained at Ir/(Ir + Rh) = 0.91 corresponding to an Ir: Rh ratio = 10: 1. The TON based on Rh was determined to be 23 [19]. The combination of the photosensitizer bis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium bipyridine ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy))]+ 2.1 with a water reduction catalyst (WRC), [Co(DO)(DOH)pnBr2] (cobalt-N,N 2′- propanediylbis(2,3-butanedione 2-imine 3-oxime dibromide) 2.3, give efficient systems for hydrogen generation under visible-light irradiation using TEA as the sacrificial electron donor. The photosensitizer 2.1, combined with water reduction catalyst 2.3 and TEA in CH3CN/H2O (1:1) solution at pH 10 was irradiated at 25 °C using a xenon lamp (500 W) with cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm), and the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the system shows a TON of 307. In this system, the addition of 1 equiv. of PPh3 has a strong influence on the course of the photocatalytic reaction. The best results in terms of stability are obtained when 2 equiv. of PPh3 is added to the reaction mixture, and a TNO of up to 696 was achieved during a 10 h experiment [20]. Image 9 The three-component system of photosensitizer 2.1 with diiron based water reduction catalyst (WRC): [{(μ-SCH2)2NCH2C6H5}{Fe(CO)3}{Fe(CO)2P(Py)3)}] 2.4 and TEA in aqueous acetone solution displays significantly higher activity and longer lifetime for photoinduced H2 production compared to other diiron-based catalyst systems with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or Zn(II)-porphyrins. The total turnovers are up to 660 based on the iridium photosensitizer (0.01 mM) and 132 based on the diiron complex 2.4 (0.05 mM) over 8 h of irradiation under optimal conditions. Other advantages of the improved three-component system are (1) all three components are well dissolved in the acetone/water solvent mixture, and the hydrogen generation reaction is performed efficiently in an aqueous acetone solution; (2) the system does not need an additional proton source, the protons reduced by diiron-based catalyst 2.4 are from TEA and water. The lifetime of the catalyst system depends on the stability of iridium photosensitizer 2.1. The activity of the diiron-based catalyst is sustained for more than 8 h of irradiation in an aqueous acetone solution [21]. Image 10 The combination of photosensitizer [bis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium 2,2’-(4,4’-di-t-butylbipyridine]+ (Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy))+ 2.5, with photocatalyst of two dirhodium(II) complexes (Rh2phen2 2.6 or Rh2bpy2 2.7) and sacrificial electron donor, TEA, were studied. There is a greater than 6-fold increase in photocatalytic activity from Rh2bpy2 2.7 to Rh2phen2 2.6 simply from swapping phen in place of bpy. A turnover number as high as 2622 was obtained after 50 h of irradiation of a system containing the 50 μM photosesitizer [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ 2.5, 16.7 μM photocatalyst Rh2phen2 2.6, and 0.6 M sacrificial electron donor TEA [22]. Image 11 In addition to cyclometalated iridium photosensitizers and catalytic compounds, there are the other useful metal complexes such as Rh, Co and Fe metal compounds. However, mononuclear iridium compound 2.8 ([Ir(ppy)2(BPP)]+ (bis(2-phenylpyridne)iridium 2,2′:5′,2″-terpyridine), dinuclear iridium and platinum compound 2.9, and iridium and palladium compound 2.10 bearing the peripheral ligand phenyl pyridine are shown in Fig. 1 . These bimetallic compounds of Ir and platinum 2.9 and Ir and palladium 2.10 are used for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. These complexes show only weak absorptions, consisting of metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions in the visible region. Notwithstanding the above, these complexes yield excellent TONs for H2 production when 470 nm irradiation is used. Therefore, visible light excitation results in significantly higher TONs for H2 production, compared to excitation in the UV region. These photocatalytic studies were performed in acetonitrile solution containing 10% water and 2.15 M TEA. The compounds were irradiated using either 350 or 470 nm LEDs as the irradiation source. The TONs were calculated per iridium center. Irradiation of the heteronuclear [Ir(ppy)2(BPP)PtCl)2](PF6)2 2.9 or [Ir(ppy)2(BPP)PdCl)2](PF6)2 2.10 compound with 470 nm light produces hydrogen with TONs (±20%) of 308 and 254, respectively, after 18 h. Changing the excitation wavelength to 350 nm dramatically reduces the TONs for H2 production to 65 for the Pt compound 2.9 and 16 for the Pd compound 2.10. However, using photosensitizer compound [Ir(ppy)2(BPP)](PF6) 2.8 and [Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2] or [Pt(CH3CN)2Cl2] as the catalyst, similar effects were obtained by 470 nm irradiation on 1: 1 M ratio solution of [Ir(ppy)2(BPP)](PF6) 2.8 compound with catalysts of [Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2] or [Pt(CH3CN)2Cl2] to give TONs of 245 and 166, respectively. When 350 nm irradiation was used the corresponding TONs were 177 and 124, respectively. Therefore, [Ir(ppy)2(BPP)PtCl)2](PF6)2 2.9 and [Ir(ppy)2(BPP)PdCl)2](PF6)2 2.10 may both show activities as photosensiters and catalysts [23]. Three component polymethacrylates consisting of 2-(1-substitituted-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine iridium compounds 2.11, triethylene glycol methyl ether compound 2.12 and 1-methyl-4-(4’-pyridyl)-pyridinium compound 2.13 were synthesized by statistical reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization [24] with RAFT agent 2.14. The grafted copolymer as a photosensitizer with colloidal platinum K2PtCl4 as a hydrogen evolution catalyst and triethylamine as sacrificial electron donor, is photocatalytically active, and produces molecular hydrogen in water upon illumination with blue LED light at 470 nm. The turnover number of copolymer 2.15 (0.4 mg mL−1) with colloidal platinum K2PtCl4 (10−6 M) during an rradiation period of 24 h was determined to be 139.3 as shown in Eq. (6) [25] (6) Photosensitizer 2.5 with pyridylamine copper compounds (2.16 and 2.17) as the catalyst and triethylamine as sacrificial electron donor, under optimal conditions (0.2 mM of photosensitizer 2.5, with 1 μM of pyridylamine copper compounds 2.16 and 2.17, as the catalyst and 0.45 M of triethylamine as sacrificial electron donor), in Ar-saturated CH3CN/H2O (9: 1, v/v)), were shown to photocatalyze H2 production efficiently. Upon 6 h of irradiation, the turnover number (TON) reached 6108 for 2.16, and 10014 for 2.17, and photocatalytic H2 evolution quantum yields were estimated to be 3.4% and 5.6%, respectively. The two Cl-coordinated copper catalyst 2.17 is considered to play three roles: a monodentate ligand dissociation trigger, proton relay and electron relay, as shown in Scheme 1 [26]. Tables 2 and 3 , hydrogen production yields of 2-phenylpyridine cyclometalated iridium compounds, are shown as follows:"
2,Derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine cyclometalated iridium compounds,"The previous chapter shows 2-phenylpyridine iridium compounds as photosensitizers. In this chapter, first, 2-phenylpyridine iridium derivatives such as those containing CH3, n-C4H9, Ph, Cl, F, CN, COOEt and OMe groups and their ancillary ligands such as bipyridine, 4,4’-di-t-buthylbipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), its four methyl derivative (Me4-phen), two phenyl derivative (dphphen), ethylenebis(diphenylphosphine) (dppe) are discussed, as shown in Fig. 2 [27]. This 32 membered library of heteroleptic iridium compounds has been synthesized. These photosensitizers are used with tris(2,2’-dipyridine)cobalt dichloride ([Co(bpy)3]Cl2) as catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor, and they are expose to ultra-bright light emitting diodes (LEDs). In the case of using 50 μM concentrations of each of the photosensitizers with 2.5 mM tris(2,2’-dipyridine)dichlorocobalt ([Co(bpy)3]Cl2) and 0.57 M triethanolamine (TEOA) with 0.27 M LiCl in 50: 50 water acetonitrile where pH was adjusted by the addition of 0.4 ml of 12 M HCl, the six heteroleptic iridium photosensitizers shown in Fig. 2 serve as extremely effective photosensitizers 3.1–3.6 for the generation of hydrogen through the photocatalytic reduction of water. Particularly the photosensitizer [Ir(F-mppy)2(phen)]+ 3.5, a system which has a turnover number of 920 and attained a hydrogen evolution of 490 μmol [27]. Furthermore, A) CˆN ligands used for [Ir(CˆN)2(bpy)]+ and [Ir(CˆN)2(dtbbpy)]+ compounds; B) Neutral ligands used for [Ir(ppy)2(NˆN)]+ and [Ir(ppy)2(PˆP)]+; C) NˆN ligands used for [R(NˆN)3]3+ complexes are shown in Fig. 3 . In these many photosensitizers and rhodium catalysts, an optimal catalyst combination was [Ir(f-mppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ 3.7 and [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ 3.8. The result for [Ir(f-mppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ 3.7 and [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ 3.8 in photosynthetic-H2 reaction in the optimal solvent ratio, 1 μmol of Ir photosensitizer and rhodium catalyst in 10 ml of 0.6 M TEA in THF-H2O (80%), with 460 nm, 500 mW irradiation for 18 h, achieved an H2 evolution of 1063 μmol and TON of 2126. However, to examine the concentration dependence more thoroughly, an experiment was conducted by varying the concentrations of Ir photosensitizer and Rh catalyst independently in the range of 0.05–0.15 M. The results of this 25-reaction array demonstrate that catalyst performance improves when one component is evaluated with an excess of the other component, and TONs and quantum yields more than 5000 and 34% are achieved for both the Ir photosensitizer and the Rh catalyst [28]. Image 13 Hydrogen evolution experiments with photosensitizer (2-phenylpyridine iridium 4-vinyl-2,2’-bipyridine derivatives) 3.9, photocatalysts (K2PtCl4 or [Rh(bpy)2Cl2]+) and sacrificial electron donor TEA, were performed in sealed vials with a 16-well LED photoreactor (λem = 460 nm) on an orbital shaker with a thermostatic block (25 °C). The combination of iridium photosensitizers (PS) with vinyl moieties and colloidal Pt catalysts, especially for compounds 3.10–3.13, exceeded approximately 8000 TON (2n(H2)/n(PS)) in a 50 μM solution of the iridium photosensitizers in THF/water/TEA (8/1/1) after 48 h irradiation. These studies should prove very useful for optimization of an existing novel visible-light driven water-reduction system of high stability [29] (see Fig. 4 ). Cyclometalated ligands and their ancillary ligands as photosensitizer iridium compounds are shown in Fig. 5 . These photosensitizer compounds have been evaluated for their efficacy in hydrogen-producing photoreactions with K2PtCl4 photocatalyst and TEA as a sacrificial electron donor. In particular, with photosensitizer compounds [Ir(ppy)2(dethqpy)]+ 3.14 and [Ir(ppy)2(qpy)]+ 3.15, hydrogen evolutions of approximately 3000 μmol and PS TON (1/2H2/PS) of approximately 6000 are achieved [30]. Two cyano-substituted cyclometalated iridium compounds, bis(2-(4-cyanophenyl)-5-methylpyridine)iridium 4,4’-di-t-butyl-2,2’-bipyridine ([Ir(CNmppy)2 (dtbbpy)]+ 3.16 and bis(2-(4-cyanophenyl)-5-methylpyridine)iridium 4,4’-dicyano-2,2’-bipyridine ([Ir(CNmppy)2 (dCNbpy)]+ 3.17, which bear strong electron-donating and electron-withdrawing ancillary ligands were synthesized to probe the extremes of the complexes' tunability. One chromophore 3.16 possessed a particularly long lifetime of approximately 8 μs; it was also a remarkably efficient triplet emitter with a quantum yield of 63%. The iridium compounds [Ir(CNmppy)2 (dtbbpy)]+ 3.16, and [Ir(CNmppy)2 (dCNbpy)]+ 3.17 produced hydrogen with TON reaching 2000 and 1400, respectively, under optimized conditions [31]. Image 14 The three types of tris(2-phenylpyridine) 3.18–3.20, and bis(2-phenylpyridine) iridium compounds 3.1 as highly active and stable photosensidizer iridium compounds with [Co(bpy)3]2+ 3.21 and [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+ 3.22 as water reduction catalysts and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor were prepared for the conversion of water to hydrogen as shown in Fig. 6 . A set of long-lived and highly active systems for hydrogen evolution was obtained in the IrIII-RhIII-TEOA systems. Comparative studies indicated that the photocatalytic performance of these homoleptic tris-cyclometalated iridium compounds 3.18–3.20 was superior to that of the cationic iridium compound 3.1. This significant increase in photocatalytic efficiency was in part attributed to the higher photostability of the neutral IrIII compounds. This assumption is supported by their different coordination modes and photophysical and electrochemical properties. These systems maintained their activity for more than 72 h under visible-light irradiation, and a total turnover number of up to 3040 was reached, based on tris-cyclometalated iridium compound 3.18 [32]. The photocatalyzed reactions of five photosensitizer iridium compounds bearing carboxyl ester or phosphonate groups 3.23–3.27: with K2PtCl4 as the catalyst and TEA as sacrificial electron donor in acetonitrile/water solution were carried out for hydrogen production. Two irradiation wavelengths were employed: 355 and 470 nm. The TONs for 2,2’-bipyridine, 5-bromide 3.24 and 2,2’-bipyridine, 5-pyidine 3.26 were determined to be 109 and 162, and 147 and 121, respectively [33] (see Fig. 7 ). Two neutral 4-trifluoromethyl-2-phenylpyridine iridium compounds 3.28, 3.29 as photosensitizers with cobalt catalysts, [Co(bpy)3]2+ 3.31, and as sacrificial electron donor (TEOA) display long-term photostability under constant illumination over 72 h; compound 3.28 achieved a relatively high turnover number of 1880 during this period. In the case of compound 3.28, the three-component homogeneous photocatalytic system was proven to be more efficient than a related system containing charge a compound 3.30. In combination with rhodium catalyst 3.32, the performances of the system using both complexes were also evaluated, and these systems exhibited a more efficient catalytic propensity for water splitting than did the cobalt-based systems that have been studied previously. Iridium compound 3.28 with rhodium catalyst 3.32 at a concentration of 1 μM, after 36 h of irradiation, achieved a TON of 3704, H2 185.2 μmol [34] (see Fig. 8). Tables 4 and 5 , hydrogen production yields of derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine cyclometalated iridium compounds, are shown as follows:"
3,Other cyclometalated iridium compounds,"The previous chapters 2 and 3 show 2-phenylpyridine iridium compounds and their derivatives as the photosensitizers. In this chapter, the other iridium compounds such as 2-phenylbenzothiazole, 2-(2’-thiophenyl)pyridine, and bis-benzimizole iridium are discussed. The three-component combination of bis(2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)benzothiazole)iridium 2,2’-bipyridine-4,4-dicarboxylate 4.1 as photosensidizer, K2PtCl4 as a catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donor was tested. With photosensitizer 4.1 (1 μM), catalyst (0.02 mM) and TEOA (0.28 M) in water at a neutral pH under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), hydrogen is produced efficiently (216 μmol) and a TON of approximately 1600 can be achieved. When the concentration of compound 4.1 was increased to 50 μM, a total of 3420 μmol of H2 was produced, representing a TON of 507 for the catalytic system. The observed TONs for hydrogen production of the TiO2-anchored sample were significantly higher than that of unattached homogeneous systems. In a pH-neutral aqueous solution, 1223 turnovers of hydrogen evolution were achieved by the TiO2-anchored samples [35]. Image 15 Five types of 2-phenylbenzothiazole iridium derivatives 4.1–4.5 bearing electron-withdrawing CF3 and electron-donating NMe2 substituents were investigated, as shown in Fig. 9 . These compounds were found to exhibit visible-light-induced hydrogen production and light-to-electricity conversion in photoelectrochemical cells. The yields of hydrogen production from water using these compounds were compared, which revealed substantial dependence on their structures, particularly on the nature of the substituent of the cyclometalated ligand. The highest turnover number of 1501 was achieved by compound 4.2 (3-trifluoromethyl-2-phenylbenzothiazole), in which the electron-withdrawing CF3 substituent was connected to phenyl ring of the cyclometalated ligand. The carboxylate anchoring group made the compounds highly suitable for anchoring onto TiO2 surfaces to provide efficient electron transfer. This resulted in an enhancement of hydrogen evolution compared to the unattached homogeneous systems. When nanoparticle TiO2 was used for the fabrication of heterogeneous photocatalytic systems, a clear change in their activity was observed as a result of the induction of efficient charge separation [36]. Reactions of the combinations of 2-(2’-thiophenyl)pyridine iridium compounds 4.6–4.10 and 2-(phenylpyridine) iridium compound 4.11 as photosensitizers, with [Co(bpy)3]2+ as catalyst and TEAO as sacrificial electron donor were performed in a hydrogen evolution system. All of the neutral compounds 4.6–4.9 exhibit durability, and compound 4.11 provided considerably higher hydrogen-evolution performance than compounds 4.6–4.10 for 50 h. For example, with neutral compound 4.6, the catalytic activity had ceased at 72 h. However, the addition of the same amount of [Co(bpy)3]2+ catalyst used in the previous photocatalytic reaction was sufficient to restart hydrogen production and showed completely recovered activity after irradiation for a further 72 h, suggesting that decomposition of the species occurred during the photocatalytic reaction. Remarkably, enhanced activity and improved long-term photostability of this system were achieved by the second addition of [Co(bpy)3]2+. This system was subject to five consecutive photochemical runs with intermittent evacuation over a period of 360 h. The overall amount of hydrogen that was evolved during all of the runs was 544.6 μmol (TON = 2178), which far exceeded the amount evolved using compound 4.11 (110 μmol) [37] (see Fig. 10 ). Five types of bis-benzimidazole iridium compounds 4.12–4.16 shown were synthesized as photosensitizers, as shown in Fig. 11 . In these compounds, the dinuclear species (4.12, 4.13) are more active (approximately twice) compared to the corresponding mononuclear compounds (4.14–4.16). Turnover numbers of up to 3780 for dinuclear iridium compound 4.12 and 1020 for mononuclear iridium compound 4.14 were obtained under the identical conditions. 286 μmol of hydrogen was produced by dinuclear iridium photosensitizer 4.12 at 20 μM with catalyst [Co(bpy)3]2+ of (0.33 mM) and sacrificial electron donor TEOA (0.19 M) in acetone/water (4: 1) (v/v), 100 ml, pH 8.0, upon irradiation (Xe lamp 300 W, λ > 420 nm) for 72 h [38]. Table 6 , hydrogen production yields of other cyclometalated iridium compounds, are shown as follows:"
4,Cyclometalated compounds containing other metals,"In chapters 2, 3 and 4, various cyclometalated iridium compounds are described as photosensitizers. This fifth chapter describes photosensitizers made of other metal compounds besides cyclometalated iridium compounds such as palladium, gold, platinum and ruthenium cyclometalated compounds. The following CNN pincer palladium cyclometalated compounds 5.1a - 5.4b as photosensitizers are shown in Fig. 12 . Photosensitizers 5.1a - 5.4b with [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] (dmgH = dimethylglyoxime; py = pyridine) 5.5 as the catalyst and triethanolamine as the sacrificial electron donor, were used for hydrogen production. A maximum turnover number for hydrogen production (5.4a) of 175 was achieved in 4 h using a xenon lamp [39]. The CNC pincer gold cyclometalated compounds 5.6 and 5.7 as photosensitizers are shown in Fig. 13 . With the following three components: CNC pincer gold compound bearing an electron donating OMe as the photosensitizer 5.6, catalyst [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] 5.5 and sacrificial electron donor TEOA, maximum turnover numbers for hydrogen production of more than 350 after 4 h under a 300 W xenon lamp, and 250 under sunlight were achieved [40]. A photostable p-type NiO photocathode based on bifunctional cyclometalated ruthenium photosensitizer 5.8, bound to cobaltoxime component 5.9 as the catalyst, was created for visible light-driven water reduction to produce hydrogen. Photosensitizer 5.8 can bind strongly on the surface of NiO in the presence of neutral water or pH buffer solutions. The high stability of this photocathode is important for the practical application of these devices for solar fuel production. The photostable NiO photocathode can be used in a photoelectrochemical device for hydrogen production from water [41] (see Fig. 14 ). CNN pincer cyclometalated platinum photosensitizers 5.10–5.15, with a colloidal platinum catalyst and triethanolamine as sacrificial electron donor, were employed in the photocatalytic hydrogen-generation system. The compounds 5.11–5.13 are very stable dyads upon visible-light irradiation. Compounds 5.11 and 5.12 performed almost equally during the first 10 h of irradiation, and the TON achieved more than 150, whereas compound 5.11 exhibited a far better durability than 5.12 for a longer irradiation period and retained most of its activity after 20 h of irradiation. Furthermore, with CNN pincer phenyl derivative 5.15, a TON of 166 for hydrogen evolution was achieved after 12 h of irradiation [42] (see Fig. 15) . With 2-phenylpyridine platinum dichloride (Pt(ppy)Cl2) [K(18-crown-6)]·0.5H2O (18-crown-6 = 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexacyclooctadecane) compound 5.16 as a photosensitizer, with [Ru(bpy)3(NO3)2]·3H2O as catalyst, EDTA as a sacrificial electron donor, NaCl and acetate buffer solution (CH3COOH, CH3COONa, pH 5.0) under irradiation with 350 W Xe lamp at 20 °C in Ar atmosphere, the total amount of hydrogen evolved from a 10 ml solution after 5 h of irradiation was 69 μmol (1.55 ml) and the TON was 69.2 [43].

5,Catalytic hydrogen production,"Hydrogen production by the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane with Pt-Al2O3, formic acid and bis(2,2’-pyrimidine) bis-iridium compound as the catalysts is already described in chapter 1. This chapter describes hydrogen production by cyclometalated iridium compounds used as the catalysts. In weakly acidic water, [Ir(4-1H-pyrazol-1-yl-κN 2)benzoic acid-κC3, (H2O)]+ 6.1 was found to catalyze hydrogen evolution (at pD 4.6, 96%) from NADH to produce NAD+ without irradiation at room temperature as shown in Eq. (7). The TOF value of the hydrogen evolution reached up to 52 h−1 at pH 4.1. On the other hand, under an atmosphere of H2 at room temperature, NAD+ was catalytically reduced by H2 reduced to produce NADH selectively at a high yield (97% at PD 8.0) under natural, slightly basic conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of aqua compound 6.2 [44]. (7) Image 18 Pyrazole iridium compound 6.1 was reduced by aliphatic alcohols to produce the corresponding hydride compound 6.3 at room temperature in a basic aqueous solution (pH 13.6) as shown in Eq. (8). Pyrazole iridium hydride 6.3 reacts with a proton to generate a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen when the pH was decreased to 0.8 by the addition of diluted sulfuric acid as shown in Eq. (9) [45]. (8) (9) Both the storage and evolution of hydrogen were carried out using cyclometalated pyrazol benzoic acid iridium compound 6.1. Hydrogen evolution from formic acid is produced by cyclometalated pyrazol iridium compound 6.1 in acidic water (pH 2.8) at room temperature as shown in Eq. (10). The reverse reaction, i.e., hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by hydrogen was also carried out with pyrazol iridium compound 6.1 under an atmosphere of H2 in weakly basic water (pH 7.5) at room temperature as shown in Eq. (11). Thus, interconversion between hydrogen and formic acid in water at ambient temperature and pressure has been achieved using compound 6.1 as an efficient catalyst in both directions depending on pH [46]. (10) (11) Cyclometalated 2-phenylimidazoline iridium compounds are also very useful catalysts for producing hydrogen from formic acid. For example, 2-phenylimidazoline iridium compounds 6.4 and 6.5 were found to be excellent catalysts for the decomposition of azeotropic HCOOH-NEt3 mixtures to give H2 and CO2 under mild conditions with high turnover frequencies (up to 147000 h−1 at 40 °C) and essentially no CO formation as shown in Eqs. (12) [47]. (12) Image 24 The proposed catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of HCOOH is shown in Scheme 2 [47]."
6,Concluding remarks,"2-phenylpyridine iridium compounds are representative photosensitizers for high hydrogen production from water when used in conjunction with such catalysts as [Rh(dtbbpy)3]3+, [Rh(dtb-bpy)3]3+, [Co(bpy)3]2+, Rh2phen2, K2PtCl4 and such sacrificial electron donors as triethylamine (TEA), triethanolamine (TEOA). Compound 2.5 and its derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing ligands such as F, Cl, CF3 and CN, and electron-donating ligand, such as CH3; compounds 3.7, 3.10–3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, 3.18 and 3.28, 2-phenylbenzothiazole and NCN pincer iridium compounds bearing electron-withdrawing CF3; compounds 4.1, 4.2 and 4.12 also exhibit excellent performance as photosensitisers. Conversely cyclometalated 2-phenylimidazoline iridium compounds 6.4 and 6.5 are highly useful catalysts for hydrogen production from formic acid."
