0,Introduction,"Every year, large amounts of waste activated sludge (WAS) are produced from biological municipal wastewater processes (8.2 and 3.6 million tons predicted for the United States and China, respectively, in 2010) (Jiang et al., 2009). This biomass residue cause significant environmental problems if it is disposed of without appropriate treatment. Anaerobic digestion is generally used in sludge treatment to produce methane. However, more attention has recently been drawn to bio-hydrogen production from WAS through anaerobic fermentation (Guo et al., 2010; Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2008; Ting and Lee, 2007; Xiao and Liu, 2009; Zhao et al., 2010). Hydrogen gas (H2) is a valuable energy carrier with an energy yield of 142.9 kJ/g, 2.57 times than that of methane (Lide, 2010). Using WAS as the substrate for bio-hydrogen production provides two main advantages over the chemical-physical hydrogen production: It doubles as a means of waste minimization and it produces carbon-neutral energy using a plentiful biomass in a sustainable way. Protein, a main component of the microbial cells, accounts for 35–61% of the total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of WAS. Carbohydrates account for 7–11%, and lipids and other compounds account for under 1%, as determined through TCOD (Feng et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010). However, no proof indicating that the H2 production is associated with the direct utilization of protein by microorganisms has yet been published (Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2008; Xiao and Liu, 2009). Fermentative bacteria cannot use most of the resources in WAS to produce H2. For WAS, almost all protein and carbohydrates are enveloped in flocs made up of microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances. The low level of soluble carbohydrate in these solutions further increases the difficulty of hydrogen production through fermentation, though this can be counteracted by the application of proper pretreatments to release intracellular organic materials. Another problem with fermentative H2 production is that H2 is frequently consumed during the process. Hydrogen is always consumed by methanogens due to its generating stage, the acidification of hydrolyzed products, before the methanogenesis. Additional means of inhibiting methane production are needed to increase H2 yield and purity. However, although some pretreatment methods, such as heat-shocking, sterilization, alkaline and acidic treatments, freeze–thawing and ultrasonic can be used to kill methanogens (Cai et al., 2004; Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2008; Ting and Lee, 2007; Xiao and Liu, 2009), the accumulated H2 is still consumed by other organisms, such as homoacetogens (Cai et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2010). Producing H2 by fermentation of WAS has another flaw that is it need for mesophilic or thermophilic conditions. The microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), developed from the microbial fuel cell (MFC), is a promising means for hydrogen production from organic wastes and biomass through electrohydrogenesis (Liu et al., 2005). In MECs, bacteria (exoelectrogens) (Logan and Regan, 2006) on the anode oxidize the substrate to transfer electrons extracellularly. Electrons are accepted by the anode and travel through an external circuit to the cathode, where they reduce the protons in the solution to produce H2. Only a small voltage (0.2–0.8 V) is applied to the circuit to overcome the energy barrier of H2 formation from a given substrate. This is substantially less than the 1.8–2.0 V used in hydrogen production via water electrolysis. To date, substrates used for electrohydrogenesis include almost all kinds of organic matter, such as carbohydrates, alcohols, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and proteins (Cheng and Logan, 2007; Lu et al., 2010). Thus, MEC should be considered an effective means of enhancing of H2 production from WAS by cascade utilization of the various organic materials in the WAS. First, it is easy for an MEC to utilize the carbohydrates in WAS for H2 production. The exoelectrogens either metabolize the carbohydrate directly or they use the fermentative products of carbohydrates such as alcohols and VFAs to produce electrons (Logan, 2009). Fermentative bacteria cannot use these metabolites. Second, as shown in our previous work, protein can be used directly to produce H2 in MECs (Lu et al., 2010). Third, protein is prone to acidification in the fermentation process (which generally accompanies electrohydrogenesis) and acidification can be enhanced by an alkaline pretreatment (Cai et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010). After that, the acidification products, such as VFAs, can be used by MECs to generate H2. In a two-chamber MEC, the H2 produced at the cathode is separated from the anode by a proton- or ion-exchange membrane, which prevents anodic bacteria (e.g. hydrogenotrophic methanogens, exoelectrogens or homoacetogens) from consuming most of it. Although small amounts of H2 generally diffuse to the anode, homo-acetogenesis and H2 oxidization by exoelectrogens does not cause any H2 loss because of the acetate (produced by the homoacetogens) and H2 can be re-oxidized by exoelectrogens to produce current that is regenerated to H2 at the cathode (Parameswaran et al., 2010). Acetoclastic methanogens use acetate to grow with a half-maximum rate concentration (Ks) of 177–427 mg-COD/L, which is much larger than the half-maximum rate of 0.64 mg-COD/L observed in exoelectrogens (Esteve-Nunez et al., 2005; Lawrence and McCarty, 1969). Hence, the exoelectrogens easily out-compete acetoclastic methanogens for substrates in MEC systems. Other studies have revealed that H2 consumption can be effectively controlled even in single-chamber MECs by increasing the rate of H2 transfer to the gas phase (Call and Logan, 2008; Lee et al., 2009). In other words, harvesting the H2 as fast as it is produced at the cathode prevents H2 loss. The goals of this study are to determine (1) whether higher hydrogen yields than those obtained by fermentation can be achieved by electrohydrogenesis using WAS and (2) whether MECs could accomplish cascade utilization of organics inside WAS, that is, using a wider range of substrates than fermentation. To achieve both goals, we used raw and alkaline-pretreated WAS as the substrates in two- and single-chamber MECs for H2 production. The formation of intermediates and changes in the composition of the WAS in terms of dissolved organic matter (DOM), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and intracellular substances (IS) during electrohydrogenesis were examined using three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw and alkaline-pretreated waste activated sludge,"2.1 Raw and alkaline-pretreated waste activated sludge Alkaline-pretreated waste activated sludge (A-WAS) was used as substrate in the MECs in addition to raw waste activated sludge (R-WAS). The process of alkaline pretreatment took place as follows: concentrated sludge was subjected to fermentation at constant pH 10 for 8 days in 500 mL media storage bottles (VWR, Inc.) with magnetic stirring at 80 rpm (Yuan et al., 2006). After fermentation, the pH was adjusted to 7. Before being fed into the MECs, R-WAS and A-WAS were mixed with a 100 mM nutrient phosphate buffer solution (NPBS) (Na2HPO4, 9.16 g/L; NaH2PO4∙H2O, 4.9 g/L; NH4Cl, 0.31 g/L; KCl, 0.13 g/L) to increase solution ionic conductivity. The characteristics of buffered R-WAS and A-WAS are shown in Table 1 ."
3,MEC construction,"2.2 MEC construction We constructed two kinds of MECs and corresponding microbial fuel cells (MFCs) used for anode biofilms enrichment. A two-chamber MFC/MEC (TMFC/TMEC) was built by connecting two 300-mL glass bottles (VWR, Inc.) using a glass tube (inside diameter 2.5 cm) containing a separator of cation exchange membrane (CEM) (4.9 cm2, CMI-7000, Membrane International Inc.) with a liquid volume of 250 mL in both the anode and cathode chambers (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) and a graphite brush anode (5 cm diameter × 7 cm length; fiber type: T700-12K, Toray, Inc.). The cathode was a graphite brush same as the anode, placed in MFC or carbon cloth (7 cm2, type B, E-TEK, Inc.) containing 0.5 mg/cm2 Pt catalyst in MEC. Electrodes were cleaned sequentially with nitric acid, acetone, ethanol, and deionized water (each cleaning step lasted 1 day). In TMFCs, the catholyte was 50 mM K3Fe(CN)6 dissolved in 100 mM NPBS with its pH adjusted to 7. In TMECs, the catholyte was 100 mM NPBS. A single-chamber MFC/MEC (SMFC/SMEC) was constructed as described previously (Lu et al., 2009). It contained a graphite brush anode and a carbon cloth cathode with a liquid volume of 26 mL (Fig. S1C)."
4,Inoculation and operation,"2.3 Inoculation and operation All anodes were enriched in MFCs using R-WAS as inoculum and substrate. When the exoelectrogens colonized on the anode surface, a reproducible maximum voltage was obtained. The anodes were removed and placed in the MECs. All MECs were fed buffered R-WAS or A-WAS in fed-batch mode. The anolyte and catholyte in TMECs were continuously stirred (200 rpm) with magnetic stirrers. Prior to operation, the sludge was sparged with nitrogen gas (99.999%) for at least 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen. Then a fixed voltage of 0.6 V was applied to the MECs by a programmable power source (3645A, Array, Inc.). The current in the circuit was determined by measuring the voltage drop across a high-precision resistor (10 Ω) using a multimeter/data acquisition system (model 2700 with 7702 module, Keithley, Inc.) at 10-min intervals. In TMECs, the pH in the anodic chamber was on-line monitored by a dual channel pH controller (PC-3200, SUNTEX, Inc.) with pH sensors (HA405-90-PA-SC-88G-K19, Mettler-Toledo, Inc.), and values were recorded using a paperless recorder (VX3000R, PanGu, Inc., China). For each batch cycle, another MEC with no applied voltage served as control. Reactors were refilled with solution when the current decreased below 1 mA for TMECs and 0.5 mA for SMECs. Exposing anodes to the air for 15 min per batch interval was adopted to inhibit the growth of methanogens. All tests were conducted using duplicate reactors over more than three cycles at constant room temperature (19 ± 1 °C)."
5,Analyses and calculations,"2.4 Analyses and calculations The gas produced by the MEC was collected in a gas bag (0.1 L Cali-5-Bond, Calibrate, Inc.), and the total volume was measured using a glass syringe. Gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (4890D, Agilent, Inc.) (Lu et al., 2009). Sludge samples from MECs were immediately filtered through 0.22 μm pore-diameter cellulose acetate filters, and the filtrate was analyzed for VFAs, ethanol, SCOD, ammonia nitrogen ( NH 4 + –N), soluble carbohydrate and protein. The analyses of total COD, SCOD, TSS, VSS and ammonia levels were conducted according to standard methods (American Public Health Association (APHA), 1998). The concentrations of VFAs (acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids) and ethanol were analyzed using another gas chromatograph (7890A, Agilent, Inc.). Lactic acid was measured using a d-/l-Lactic Acid Assay Kit (Megazyme Inc.). Soluble protein concentrations were determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce). The total protein (TP) content of the sludge was calculated as described by Miron et al. (Miron et al., 2000) (details in Supplementary section). Total and soluble carbohydrates were measured by the phenol–sulfuric method (DuBois et al., 1956). The COD conversion factors are 1.5 g-COD/g-protein, 1.06 g-COD/g-carbohydrate, 1.07 g-COD/g-acetic acid, 1.51 g-COD/g-propionic acid and 1.82 g-COD/g butyric acid (Grady et al., 1999). Details of extraction processes of dissolved organic matter (DOM), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and intracellular substances (IS) in the sludge solution are given in the Supplementary section. Electrochemical analyses were performed with a potentiostat/galvanostat (263A, Ametek, Inc.). After enrichment, the internal resistances of the MFCs were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (details in Supplementary section). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed to determine the power densities (normalized to liquid volume of anode chamber) of sludge MFCs (Fig. S3). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted using a three-electrode arrangement under anaerobic conditions (Fig. S4). The conductivities of sludge solution were measured using a conductivity meter (DDSJ-308A, Shanghai Preci. Sci. Instru. Co., Ltd.). The performance of the MECs was evaluated in terms of hydrogen production rate Q (m3-H2/m3/day), volumetric current density I V (A/m3 liquid volume of anode chamber), hydrogen yield Y H 2 (mg-H2/g-COD or mg-H2/g-COD removal), Coulombic efficiency ( C E ), cathodic hydrogen recovery ( r cat ), overall hydrogen recovery ( R H 2 = C E r cat ) and energy recovery relative to the electrical input ( η E ) as described previously (Logan et al., 2008)."
6,Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC),"2.5 Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) EEM spectra of the components of the sludge (DOM, EPS and IS) were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-6500, JASCO, Inc.). Details of spectra scan and elimination of inner filtering effect and Raman scattering are given in the Supplementary section. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to model EEM fluorescence data in this study. Higher order arrays of EEM spectra were decomposed into a tri-linear structured part and a noise part by PARAFAC. The information was contained in the structured part. Core consistency diagnostics were used to determine the appropriate number of components in the PARAFAC analysis (Bro and Kiers, 2003). For each component with a tri-linear structure, the matrix X was decomposed into three vectors: two loading vectors and one score vector. The score vector of each component corresponded to its relative concentration due to the neglection of the inner filtering effect. The two loading vectors correspond to the excitation and emission characters of the fluorescence components. Before analysis, the raw EEM fluorescence spectra data were corrected with the background and these close to the Rayleigh scattering line were set as zero to make them conform to the tri-linear structure required for the PARAFAC analysis. The algorithm used in this paper was proposed by Bro (1997) and is available from the N-way Toolbox for MATLAB at the website http://www.models.kvl.dk/."
7,Results and discussion,
8,MECs enrichment and production of current,"3.1 MECs enrichment and production of current MEC anodes were enriched in MFCs for 30–35 (TMFCs) and 15–18 (SMFCs) days to demonstrate reproducible maximum voltage generation of 592 ± 1 mV (TMFCs) and 560 ± 2 mV (SMFCs) (1000 Ω). TMFCs produced significant less power density (1.0 ± 0.1 W/m3) than SMFCs (25.7 ± 0.2 W/m3). The CV of these electrodes revealed an obvious anodic current profile characteristic of catalytic activity (Fig. S4). The above prove that bioelectrochemical active biofilms were formed on the anodes using R-WAS as inoculum and substrate. Then the reactors were operated in MEC mode. TMECs fed A-WAS produced slightly larger current densities (10 ± 0 A/m3), than those fed with R-WAS (8 ± 0 A/m3). This was caused by the increase in soluble substrates produced by alkaline pretreatment. However, TMECs showed significant internal resistance, as can be inferred from their TMFCs equivalent (521.85 Ω). This internal resistance lowered current densities. SMECs, which had lower internal resistance (25.2 Ω, SMFCs equivalent), were used to improve current production using A-WAS. They produced an average current density 13 times larger than that of TMEC (Table 2 ). Since the hydrogen production rate can be expressed as a direct function of current density, single-chamber configuration can be said to have improved the rate of H2 production from WAS."
9,High hydrogen production yields,"3.2 High hydrogen production yields TMECs gave an average H2 production yield of 3.89 ± 0.39 mg-H2/g-DS (5.67 ± 0.61 mg-H2/g-VSS) using R-WAS (Fig. 1 a). This yield is several times larger than all values that have been reported for fermentation, regardless of whether the wastewater sludge was raw or pretreated (Table 3 ). Because R-WAS releases limited amounts of organic materials into solution, the high yields indicated that elelctrohydrogenesis made full use of these soluble substrates for H2 generation. That is, more kinds of organic matter were utilized in MEC than in fermentation. To prove this, we began with the assumption that carbohydrates were the only substrates that could be used by MEC because no organic acids or ethanol were detected in R-WAS solution (Fig. 3 a). Then we divided the H2 yield practically obtained in TMECs (Y-MEC) by the thermodynamic yield calculated from the removal of total carbohydrate (TYC) during electrohydrogenesis based on 12 mol-H2/mol-hexose. Calculation produced a ratio of 127 ± 20% (Y-MEC/TYC), which was over 100% (Fig. 1b), suggesting that a portion of H2 (at least 27%) was generated from organic materials other than carbohydrates. We hypothesized that this additional substrate might be protein because H2 has been successfully produced from both pure (bovine serum albumin) and complex proteins (peptone) in MEC (Lu et al., 2010). When A-WAS was fed into TMECs, the H2 yield and the ratio of Y-MEC/TYC increased to 6.78 ± 0.94 mg-H2/g-DS (15.08 ± 1.41 mg-H2/g-VSS) and 269 ± 56%, respectively. This high yield can be attributed to the abundance of soluble substrates, such as VFAs, carbohydrates, and protein in the A-WAS solution (Fig. 3c). Carbohydrates accounted for only about a third of H2 production, indicating wide substrate utilization. There was no obvious difference between SMECs and TMECs in terms of H2 yield or ratio of Y-MEC/TYC using A-WAS (Table 3 and Fig. 1b). Single-chamber configuration only increased the hydrogen production rate due to its lower internal resistance. If the substrates used for calculation of thermodynamic H2 yield included VFAs. The ratios of Y-MEC to the thermodynamic yield of the sum of substrates (TYS) were 76 ± 2% (TMECs) and 72 ± 5% (SMECs) using A-WAS (Fig. 1c). Ratios under 100% indicated that VFAs accounted for the most of H2 production when A-WAS was used as fuel. However, Y-MEC/TYS for TMECs fed by R-WAS was still 127 ± 20%. This was because no VFAs or ethanol production occurred in the raw sludge solution."
10,Hydrogen and energy recoveries,"3.3 Hydrogen and energy recoveries The approximate Coulombic efficiencies ( C E , conversion efficiency of substrate to current) of the two reactors remained between 28 ± 10% and 30 ± 3% no matter what they were fed (Table 2). The C E values were lower than those produced by pure matter, such as 93% (acetate, 0.6 V) or 127% (glucose, 0.5 V) (Call and Logan, 2008; Selembo et al., 2009). However, they were similar to the 17%–48% range generated in single-chamber MECs at 0.5 V by complex substrates such as domestic wastewater or diluted swine wastewater (Ditzig et al., 2007; Wagner et al., 2009). The main cause of this low C E was that most of the electron donors in WAS were metabolized by fermentative bacteria. Although acetoclastic methanogens are another electron donors sinker, their growth rate is very low. However, just the syntrophic interactions between the fermenters and exoelectrogens drove the cascade utilization of complex organic matter. Cathodic hydrogen recovery ( r cat ) is the efficiency of the conversion of current to H2. A relatively high r cat (69 ± 9% to 72 ± 4%) was obtained in all MECs, suggesting that H2 loss from the cathode was effectively controlled. TMECs reduced H2 loss by separation of the two-chambers, and SMECs mainly depended on the short batch cycle time and the measures for inhibition of methanogen growth (e.g. exposing anode to the air per batch interval). This was consistent with the fact that no CH4 was detected in the cathodic chamber of the TMECs and that less than 1% CH4 was found in SMECs. However, hydrogen production from WAS by SMECs has yet to be tested through long-time operation. The overall hydrogen recoveries ( R H 2 = C E r cat , 21 ± 1% to 26 ± 2%) in all reactors were comparable to those obtained from fermentation of pure carbohydrates. Because WAS is “free” waste, its energy content should not be included in the energy balance. Taking this into account the energy recovery relative to the electrical input ( η E ) ranged from 176 ± 22% to 213 ± 39%. The external voltage required for electrohydrogenesis was low (generally between 0.4 and 0.8 V), much lower than that required for hydrogen production via water electrolysis under alkaline conditions (1.8–2.0 V) (Kinoshita, 1992), and can be obtained using MFCs (Sun et al., 2008) from WAS in practice."
11,Changes in organic matter during electrohydrogenesis,"3.4 Changes in organic matter during electrohydrogenesis WAS is made up of various complex organic compounds that regularly convert from one form to another; in addition, exoelectrogens can adapt to many substrates. Both of these processes drive exoelectrogens to oxidize the complex organics in a stepwise manner. To determine the mechanisms by which substrates were degraded in MECs, we examined the changes in WAS composition and the levels of intermediates formed during electrohydrogenesis on the basis of total and soluble organic materials. All MECs removed 20 ± 3% to 28 ± 3% of TCOD, 20 ± 4% to 35 ± 7% total protein and 26 ± 3% to 34 ± 12% total carbohydrate by the end of reactions in both R-WAS and A-WAS (Fig. 2). The removal efficiencies of controls were only 0% to 12 ± 3%. The results showed that electrohydrogenesis was the main reason for the removal of organic matter, other than natural biodegradation by WAS itself. Protein removal accounted for the major part of TCOD removal. Alkaline pretreatment increased the removal of TCOD and total carbohydrate but decreased total protein removal relative to R-WAS in TMECs. Alkaline pretreatment destroyed the construction of sludge flocs and accelerated hydrolysis and acidification. This provided more soluble substrate for MECs and increased overall consumption of organic materials. However, A-WAS was rich in organic acids and soluble carbohydrates. These are easier for exoelectrogens to use than large-molecule proteins. Therefore, the total protein removal decreased. The detectable organic acids in TMECs fed by R-WAS and A-WAS were mainly short-chain VFAs, including acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. No valeric acid or lactic acid was detected in WAS solution. Ethanol as a usual fermentation product was also absent. During electrohydrogenesis using R-WAS, the concentration of VFAs and soluble carbohydrate first increased and then decreased with time extension. Acetic and butyric acid concentrations rapidly increased from the beginning to the peaks of 98 ± 4 (at 17 h) and 26 ± 3 (at 79 h) mg-COD/L, respectively, and were exhausted at 100 h. Propionic acid and carbohydrates were not depleted completely but rather accumulated by the end of the reactions (Fig. 3a). Results indicated that the reaction in MEC caused carbohydrates to dissolve and transformed them into VFAs. Acetate is the most favorable substrate for exoelectrogens. Accumulated carbohydrate may have been more difficult to ferment. The exhaustion of butyric acid is not always be associated with exoelectrogens metabolism because butyrate is not an ideal substrate for exoelectrogens (Freguia et al., 2010). It is possible that butyrate was first fermented to acetate, and then the acetate was oxidized by exoelectrogens. The lack of propionic acid removal has been observed in previous MEC studies using glycerol (Selembo et al., 2009). Soluble protein concentration and SCOD continued to increase throughout the reaction, though total protein and TCOD decreased in general (Fig. 3b). When TMECs were fed to A-WAS, the concentrations of acetic acid, soluble carbohydrates and proteins, and SCOD always declined while those of propionate and butyrate first increased and then decreased, finally plateauing (Fig. 3c, d). After alkaline pretreatment, a large number of VFAs, proteins, and carbohydrates were observed in WAS solution. These soluble materials were enough to meet the demands of electrohydrogenesis. Thus, temporary substrate accumulation during electrohydrogenesis was not obvious. Although the concentration of soluble proteins with different change trends were observed in TMECs using different WAS, the degradation process was continuous. This was proved by an increase in ammonia, a by-product of protein degradation, during the reaction, which was independent of R-WAS or A-WAS. The pH in anode chambers of TMECs fed R-WAS decreased from 6.95 ± 0.04 to 6.32 ± 0.07, which was slightly lower than the 6.42 ± 0.02 observed in those fed A-WAS (initial pH was 6.99 ± 0.03) at the end of the cycles (Fig. S5). However, the pH in SMECs fed A-WAS even increased slightly from 6.99 ± 0.03 to 7.13 ± 0.02. These results indicated that a weak of protons migration in TMECs accounts for the decrease in pH values in the anode chambers. Alkaline pretreatment may have increased the buffering capacity of the sludge solutions. Preventing acidification is important for maintaining the activity levels of the exoelectrogens."
12,Characterization of WAS in TMECs by EEM spectra with PARAFAC,"3.5 Characterization of WAS in TMECs by EEM spectra with PARAFAC Chemical analyses provided only limited information on the changes in the composition of WAS during electrohydrogenesis. This was due to the finite chemical parameters that can be measured in a test. Some molecules including proteins, metabolites (e.g., amino, fulvic and humic acids), enzymes and pigments have a characteristic of fluorescent emission. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy can provide complete information on these fluorescent substances from complex mixtures by changing excitation wavelength and emission wavelength simultaneously (Sheng and Yu, 2006). EEM fluorescence spectroscopy technique is more selective and has a wider range than conventional fluorescence measurement or UV/Vis spectrometry. It also has the advantages of fewer interactions and fewer overlaps with of the spectra from different fluorophores (Li et al., 2008). We used EEM spectra to comprehensively reveal the component changes of WAS during electrohydrogenesis in terms of dissolved organic matter (DOM), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and intracellular substances (IS) (Fig. 4 ). Our study focused on typical zoogloea of R-WAS for it has the integrated structure. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) is a chemometric method with three-way decomposition. It can be used to separate the spectra of the main components from overlapped EEM spectra (Thygesen et al., 2004) (Fig. 5 ). Two components of DOM have been identified as tryptophan (Ex/Em 275/350) and tyrosine (Ex/Em 275/305) protein-like substances (Coble, 1996; Coble et al., 1998). In R-WAS, the concentration of soluble proteins increased in effluent and in control solutions. This was consistent with measurements taken by the BCA method. However, tyrosine-like proteins with the score vector value (SVV) of 5479 were the primary components of the effluent, and tryptophan-like proteins (SVV: 4836) were mainly found in the control solution. Because all protein-like substances in DOM must be derived from either EPS or IS and tryptophan-like proteins are the major constituent of EPS and IS, the results showed that electrohydrogenesis, unlike fermentation and biodegradation, had an effect on hydrolysis in R-WAS. The principal difference between tryptophan and tyrosine is that tryptophan has an extra five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. The variations in IS levels also showed that electrohydrogenesis had an effect on R-WAS. Intracellular substances were mainly made up of two components, tryptophan protein-like substances and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH) (Ex/Em 350/450) (Li et al., 2008). There was only a slight decrease in the concentration of tryptophan-like proteins in the control (SVV: 5215) relative to the effluent (SVV: 6236) in IS. Whereas, the concentration of tryptophan-like proteins declined clearly after electrohydrogenesis (SVV: 3772). The concentration of NADH decreased slightly in the effluent (SVV: from 2022 to 1442) but increased in the control solution (SVV: 2610), indicating that electrohydrogenesis but not biodegradation or spontaneous fermentation had inactivated the microbial activity of the sludge. EPS is more complex than DOM or IS, and it is made up of four components, tryptophan and tyrosine protein-like substances, and both visible (Ex/Em 355, 390/465) and marine (Ex/Em 305/380) humic-like substances (Baker, 2001; Stedmon et al., 2003). Tryptophan-like proteins were the main component in EPS and decreased in concentration after reaction in MEC (SVV: from 3940 to 2795). Their concentration did not change in the control. The concentration of visible humic-like substances declined simultaneously in the effluent and control (SVV: from 3246 to 938 and 1483). The other two components were nearly unchanged after electrohydrogenesis but increased slightly in the control. Humic-like substances are formed by the microbial degradation of dead organic matter and are very resistant to further biodegradation. Exoelectrogens and their syntrophic bacteria cannot use this type of organic constituent. The decrease in visible humic-like substances in the EPS of the both effluent and control can be attributed to abiotic factors. The EEM spectra of A-WAS in TMEC is shown in Figure S6. In summary, A-WAS and R-WAS were found to have similar components. In A-WAS, DOM significantly decreased in the effluent and control relative to the influent. Results were in keeping with practical measurements, suggesting that alkaline pretreatment improved not only electrohydrogenesis but also fermentation and biodegradation in the control. However, the components in the EPS decreased more significantly than those in R-WAS after electrohydrogenesis. This could be attributed to the destruction of stable EPS structures by alkaline pretreatment. In the effluent, the concentration of IS was slightly decreased, but it was nearly unchanged in the control, indicating that the effect of electrohydrogenesis on IS was finite."
13,Outlook for hydrogen production from WAS using MECs,"3.6 Outlook for hydrogen production from WAS using MECs The advantages of MECs over fermentation as a means of producing H2 from WAS include higher H2 yield, a wider range of substrates, and fewer H2 sinks. Another superiority of this bioelectrochemical approach is its insensitivity to temperature. In this study, MECs were steadily operated at constant room temperature of 19 ± 1 °C, which was significantly lower than a general temperature range of 35–37 °C in fermentation (Guo et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). Our previous research also demonstrated that MECs remained active even at low temperatures (4 °C and 9 °C) with the similar H2 yields as those obtained at mesophilic temperature, and methanogenesis was completely inhibited by low temperatures (Lu et al., 2011). Before practical application of MECs for H2 production from WAS, several major hurdles including separator fouling, proton transfer limitation, and H2 and substrates losses, etc. need to be resolved. However, recent tremendous advances in new separator and electrode materials and novel reactor configurations for MFC/MEC have opened up a new avenue toward overcoming these bottlenecks. A practical MEC should combine the both advantages of TMEC and SMEC, such as a single-chamber MEC has the recently emerging separator electrode assembly (SEA) with advantages of low internal resistance, large proton flux, and low substrate and H2 loss (Li et al., 2011; Tartakovskya et al., 2009). Facing WAS with high solid and EPS concentrations, SEAs should use low-cost separators capable of resisting fouling and proton accumulation simultaneously, such as microfiltration membrane (MFM), ultrafiltration membrane (UFM), and glass fiber (Li et al., 2011). Advances in the development on cheap-effective electrode materials and catalysts (e.g. stainless steel cathode and nickel powder catalysts) also further reduce the costs of investment and operation for scaling-up (Call et al., 2009; Selembo et al., 2010). Our study results also indicated that a series of improvements in operating conditions, such as alkaline pretreatment, stirring thoroughly, and methanogenesis inhibition could help to overcome barriers in MECs using WAS. Alkaline hydrolysis provides a low-cost approach (lime is cheap in practical application) to transform more EPS and proteins in WAS to micro-molecular organic acids (Fig. 3c), which can help electrohydrogenesis to acquire substrates from EPS easily (Fig. S6) and alleviate the separators fouling or clogging caused by EPS. Alkaline pretreatment can also recovered a portion of H2 from WAS (Cai et al., 2004) and increase the conductivity of sludge solutions (Table 1). An intensive stirring in anode chamber not only increases mass transfer but also provides a shear force to avoid biofouling on the separators. Aerating the anodes intermittently and operating reactors at the relative low temperatures (no need for heating, unlike in fermentation) have been proved as effective methods to inhibit methane production (Lu et al., 2009, 2011) in our previous MEC studies."
14,Conclusions,"H2 was produced from raw waste activated sludge (R-WAS) in two-chamber TMECs at yields much greater than those reported for fermentation. The use of alkaline-pretreated waste activated sludge (A-WAS) nearly doubled H2 yields. Single-chamber SMECs without membrane, which have low internal resistance, were used to accelerate the rate of H2 production from A-WAS, but methanogenesis was detected in these systems. Cascade utilization of a wider range of organic matter (e.g. carbohydrate, VFAs and protein) in WAS was found to be responsible for most of the increased yield. Other advantages of MECs for H2 production from WAS involves fewer H2 sinks and insensitivity to temperature, unlike fermentation. Optimizing MEC configuration and operation conditions and improving the pretreatment processes of waste activated sludge are necessary before practical application can take place on a large scale."
