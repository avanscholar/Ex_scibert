0,Introduction,"The ever-increasing energy demand, depleting of fossil fuels, and environmental issues, emphasize the importance of developing renewable and clean energy systems [1–3]. Hydrogen as an energy carrier is a promising alternative to fossil fuels for its sustainability and zero carbon emission [4,5]. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) enabled electrochemical water splitting is one of the major routes to produce hydrogen, with the help of electrocatalysts [6,7]. Currently, Platinum group metal (PGM) materials are considered to be the most effective electrocatalysts for HER. However, the wide applications of PGM electrocatalysts are seriously hindered by the high cost and scarcity of precious metals. The search for earth-abundant and high-efficient non-PGM HER electrocatalysts has triggered intensive research efforts. Most of transition metal atoms (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, W) bind hydrogen either too weakly or too strongly and thus are unsatisfactory towards HER. However, the addition of phosphorus (P) into transition metals can improve the performance by stabilizing the d-orbitals of metals and facilitating the charge transfer from transition metal atoms to phosphorus atoms through the ligand effect [8]. For transition metal phosphides (TMPs), phosphorus atoms (proton acceptor) “dilutes” transition metal atoms (hydride acceptors) resulting in a weakened Metal-H bond (i.e. ensemble effect) [9–11]. Moreover, increasing P/metal ratio of TMPs may enhance the HER performance [10,12–14].Therefore, TMPs including iron phosphides [15–17], cobalt phosphides [18–24], nickel phosphides [25–27], molybdenum phosphides [10,28,29], tungsten phosphides [30,31] have emerged as potential HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a self-supported three-dimensional (3-D) CoP3 nanoplate arrays in situ grown on carbon cloth (CoP3 NPAs/CC) synthesized by a high vacuum solid-state reaction. Our CoP3 NPAs/CC exhibits excellent HER performance and durability with a very small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, CoP3 NPAs/CC also shows great HER performance in 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 M KOH solutions. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH⁎) on different surfaces of CoP3 NPAs. With the combination of DFT calculations and experimental results, we conclude that the excellent catalytic performance of CoP3 NPAs benefits from the good electrical conductivity, asymmetric CoH and PH bond, low hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy and unique rich-phosphorous CoP3 nanoplate arrays structure."

4,Preparation of CoP3 NPAs/CC,"2.3 Preparation of CoP3 NPAs/CC CoP3 NPAs/CC is prepared by a simple hydrothermal and topotactic phosphidation method. In brief, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2.328 g), NH4F (0.106 g) and urea (1.2 g) are added into 40 mL water under vigorous stirring. After complete dissolution, the solution is transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and a piece of clean CC (3 cm × 2 cm) washed three times with water, alcohol and acetone, respectively, is immersed into the solution. The autoclave is then sealed and heated at 120 °C for 22 h. After natural cooling, the Co-based precursor nanoplates on carbon cloth is taken out, washed by water, and dried under vacuum. To prepare CoP3 NPAs/CC, a piece of the Co-based precursor nanoplates on CC (1.0 cm × 1.5 cm) and 30 mg red phosphorus (P) are sealed in a quartz tube under a vacuum (10−5 Pa), and then heated to 750 °C and kept for 5 h. The product of CoP3 NPAs/CC is washed with water and ethanol for several times, then dried at 50 °C under vacuum. The loading of phosphide electrocatalyst on CC is about 3 mg cm−2."

6,Electrochemical measurements and reference electrode calibration,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements and reference electrode calibration All the electrochemical experiments are carried out on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Shanghai) at room temperature using a traditional three-electrode system. Carbon rod is used as counter electrode. Mercurous sulfate, mercuric oxide and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) work as the reference electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS solutions, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is evaluated at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. All potentials are recorded vs. RHE. The potential of reference electrodes was calibrated with Pt wires as the working and counter electrode in a high purity hydrogen saturated electrolyte solution with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The average value of the two potentials at which the current pass through zero was the thermodynamic potential of the hydrogen electrode reactions (See Fig. S1 for details). Our result shows that the E(Hg/HgSO4), E(Hg/HgO) and E(SCE) are lower than E(RHE) by 0.704 V in 0.5 M H2SO4, 0.955 V in 1 M KOH and 0.654 V in 1 M PBS solutions, respectively."

8,Results and discussion,
9,Preparation and characterization of CoP3 NPAs/CC,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of CoP3 NPAs/CC The skutterudite-type CoP3 with a space group of Im3 and cubic structure (Fig. 1a) exhibits a semi-conductive characteristic with a very small band-gap of 0.21 eV which can be seen in the density of states (DOS) and electronic band structure of CoP3 (Fig. 1b). Unlike wide band-gap TMP electrocatalysts such as CuP2 (1.5 eV), FeP2 (1.1 eV), and NiP2 (0.67 eV), the CoP3 with a narrow band-gap has a relatively good electrical conductivity, which facilitates the charge transfer during electrocatalysis. Watcharapasorn et al. also reported the good conductivity of CoP3 through experiment [33]. In addition, the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for CoP3 is indicative of semiconductor behavior at low temperatures [33]. The weak temperature dependence at low temperatures also suggests that there is a small band gap which is consistent with the band structure calculation [33]. Resistance measurement shown in Fig. S2 confirms that CoP3 NPAs/CC has good electrical conductivity. CoP3 NPAs/CC with these desirable properties is prepared by a simple hydrothermal and topotactic phosphidation method with an excess of red phosphorus [22]. When the amount of red phosphorus is insufficient, the synthesized CoP3 is not pure and contains CoP, CoP2 and other low-phosphorus transition metal phosphides, as shown in Fig. S3. In order to fully convert cobalt precursor to CoP3, the excess amount of red phosphorus was added. The crystal structure of the sample is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1c): except for two peaks of 26.47° and 54.51° from the carbon cloth (JCPDS 26–1080), all the peaks can be well assigned to the CoP3 (JCPDS 29–0496), indicating Co-based NPAs/CC precursor is completely transformed into CoP3 NPAs/CC through high-vacuum phosphidation. Raman spectrum (Fig. 1d) is also employed to further confirm the CoP3 structure as the cubic structure of skutterudite CoP3 typically has eight characteristic Raman modes (ΓR = 2Ag + 2Eg + 4Tg) [34]. As a comparison, CoP3 nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared by the topotactic phosphidation of Co3O4 NPs shown in Fig. S4 and S5. The morphology of the Co-based precursor NPAs/CC and CoP3 NPAs/CC are examined by electron microscopes. As shown in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig. 2a and b), Co-based precursor shows an assembled-plates-like morphology with a glossy surface and a thickness of about 10–30 nm, uniformly covering all surfaces of the carbon cloth (CC). After topotactic phosphidation the heating rate at 2 °C min−1, the CoP3 NPAs preserves the 3-D structure and initial morphology of Co-based precursor (Fig. 2c). Both high-resolution SEM image (Fig. 2d) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 2e) exhibit that all surfaces of CoP3 NPAs are rough, indicating the as-prepared CoP3 NPAs/CC have a large surface area and high porosity, which is confirmed later by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement. Such porous and rough surface could significantly increase the active site population and thus enhance the electrochemical surface area. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) maps of phosphorus and cobalt (Fig. 2f) show that both chemical elements are evenly distributed in the CoP3 nanoplate at an atom ratio of P: Co = 2.96:1 (Fig. S6). Moreover, the effect of heating rate on morphology was evaluated. When a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 was used, the morphology of the synthesized CoP3 could not be maintained (Fig. S7). All in all, a slow ramping rate and excessive red phosphorus were adopted to control the morphology and composition of CoP3 during phosphating. The N2 sorption isotherms of CoP3 NPAs reveal a BET surface area of 86.4 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3 ). The hysteresis loop of N2 adsorption/desorption suggests that the CoP3 NPAs have a mesoporous structure. The mesoporous surface area of the CoP3 NPAs/CC can expose more surface active sites, which facilitates the charge transfer to the surface active sites to react with the permeating electrolyte to form hydrogen. In addition, from the H+ adsorption experiments (Fig. S8), it can be seen that the H+ adsorption amount (based on HCl) is 7.63 g g−1 after stable adsorption, demonstrating that a large amount of protons can be accumulated on the surface of the CoP3 NPAs/CC, which could potentially contribute to the HER performance of CoP3 NPAs/CC. The XPS are employed to investigate the surface compositions of the CoP3 NPAs/CC. As shown in Fig. 4a, the XPS survey spectrum presents the elements of Co, P, C and O. The elements of C and O may come from the substrate and superficial oxidation, respectively. In the high-resolution Co 2p spectra (Fig. 4b), four peaks are located at 779.0, 794.1, 782.2 and 799.9 eV. The peaks at 779.0 and 794.1 can be ascribed to Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, and the peaks of Co at 782.2 and 799.9 eV are the satellite peaks [35]. Fig. 4c shows the high-resolution P 2p spectrum, which is divided into three peaks located at 129.8, 130.6, and 134.5 eV. The peaks at 130.6 and 129.8 eV can be assigned to P 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively and the peaks at 134.5 eV are attributed to P2O5 or PO4 3 − due to the surface oxidation of CoP3 NPAs [36]."
10,Electrocatalytic HER performance and durability of the CoP3 NPAs/CC,"3.2 Electrocatalytic HER performance and durability of the CoP3 NPAs/CC To investigate the HER electrocatalytic performance and durability of the CoP3 NPAs/CC, the electrochemical evaluations are performed in a conventional three-electrode system with iR-compensation. The electrocatalytic HER performance of bare CC, Pt/C and CoP3 NPs with the same mass loading are also measured. All the testing electrodes are cycled 100 times between −0.5 V and −0.1 V vs. RHE at 20 mV s−1 to activate and stabilize the electrocatalysts before recording data. Fig. 5a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. As expected, the commercial Pt/C shows high electrocatalytic performance with an onset potential of near zero towards HER, while bare CC exhibits negligible HER performance. The CoP3 NPs/CC deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 71 and 221 mV, respectively. Whereas, the CoP3 NPAs/CC exhibit much better HER performance than the CoP3 NPs with current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of only 47 and 113 mV, respectively, indicating that the CoP3 NPAs/CC are excellent cathode HER electrocatalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The high performance of the CoP3 NPAs/CC makes it comparable with most reported TMP electrocatalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (Table S1). The Tafel plot is an important parameter to reveal the reaction path of HER [37]. The corresponding Tafel plots of the three electrodes are shown in Fig. 5b. The Pt/C electrode exhibits the smallest Tafel slope of 29 mV dec−1. The CoP3 NPAs show a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1 which is obviously smaller than that of the CoP3 NPs (65 mV dec−1) and even slightly larger than that of the Pt/C, implying that the HER on CoP3 NPAs catalysts likely occurs through a Volmer-heyrovsky mechanism [38]. Another important contributor to the overall electrocatalytic performance is the electrochemically active surface area which is estimated by the specific double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at the solid/electrolyte interface (Fig. 6 ) [39,40]. As shown in Fig. 6 the CoP3 NPAs show a Cdl of 102 mF cm−2, >1.5 times than that for the CoP3 NPs (66 mF cm−2), indicating that CoP3 NPAs/CC have ~1.5 times higher surface area than CoP3 NPs. The HER activity of CoP3 NPAs was further evaluated based on turnover frequency (TOF). To elucidate the TOF values of CoP3 NPs and CoP3 NPAs, the number of active sites was evaluated from the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). As shown in Fig. 6, the trend in ECSA is consistent with the increase of the surface area based on BET (Fig. 3). Combined with the unit cell parameters of CoP3 and ECSA of CoP3 NPs and CoP3 NPAs, Fig. S9 shows the polarization curves of various electrocatalysts normalized by the active sites and expressed in terms of TOF in 0.5 M H2SO4. Both the Tafel slope and the TOF results indicate that the CoP3 NPAs can realize the maximum HER activity compared with CoP3 NPs. The intrinsic activity can be enhanced by the fast rate of reactions occurring on the electrocatalyst surface. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is shown in Fig. 5c to reflect the charge transfer resistance. The semicircle can be assigned to the processes of hydronium ions transferring to electrode from solution and the diameter of the semicircle along the x-axis represents the value of charge transfer resistance (Rct), which could reflect the kinetic rate of the electrochemical reactions on electrode surface [41,42]. It can be seen that the CoP3 NPAs show much better Rct of about 70 Ω compared to approximately 210 Ω for the CoP3 NPs, illustrating much faster transfer within the CoP3 NPAs/CC. In view of the practical application, the stability and durability of CoP3 NPAs catalyst are further investigated by successive cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning and continuous electrolysis. There is a negligible activity loss after continuous CV for 10,000 cycles (Fig. 5d). The inset of Fig. 5d shows the chronoamperometric curve of CoP3 NPAs at a constant voltage of 64 mV for a 40 h continuous electrolysis, indicating that CoP3 NPAs are stable and durable HER electrocatalysts that hold promise for practical applications in water splitting. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of the CoP3 NPAs electrode at 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER is close to 100% (Fig. S10). Moreover, the composition and morphology of CoP3 NPAs after the electrocatalytic test are not changed (Fig. S11, S12 and S13). The HER catalytic performance of CoP3 NPAs/CC in 1.0 M PBS and 1.0 M KOH solution is also investigated. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the 3D CoP3 NPAs/CC show a low Tafel slope of 148 mV dec−1 and obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of −139 mV with excellent stability in 1.0 M PBS solution, demonstrating its excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M PBS solution to most of the reported non-PGM catalysts (Table S2). In 1.0 M KOH solution, CoP3 NPAs/CC show a Tafel slope of 114 mV dec−1 and achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of −106 mV (Fig. 7c and d), matching its alkaline performance to the top non-PGM HER electrocatalysts from previous reports (Table S3). Additionally, the FE of CoP3 NPAs/CC electrode at neutral and alkaline medium is close to 100% (Fig. S14), while the composition, structure, and morphology after electrocatalytic test maintain the same to the as-prepared catalysts (Fig. S15 and S16). Therefore, the CoP3 NPAs/CC exhibit competitive catalytic activity, excellent durability, and high energy efficiency, over a large pH range, demonstrating a promising non-PGM alternative that holds great industrial potential for hydrogen production."
11,Mechanism of enhanced HER performance of the CoP3 NPAs,"3.3 Mechanism of enhanced HER performance of the CoP3 NPAs The mechanism for enhanced HER catalytic performance of the CoP3 NPAs is discussed hereinafter by density function theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results. From Fig. 4, we can see that the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 (779.0 eV) and P 2p3/2 (129.8 eV) slightly shifted from that of metallic Co (778.2 eV) and elemental P (130.2 eV), respectively, indicating that the P atom and Co atom in CoP3 NPAs have a partial negative charge and positive charge, respectively [43,44]. Therefore, a small portion of electrons transfer from Co to P, and such transfer would facilitate the electrocatalytic adsorption and desorption of hydrogen atom. In this respect, the CoP3 NPAs share a similar electrocatalytic mechanism to the metal and hydrogenases complex catalysts [45,46]. To better illuminate the mechanism of enhanced catalytic performance of CoP3 NPAs for HER, we employ computational simulation to investigate the electronic band structures and hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy. We first calculate the band structure and the DOS of CoP3 (Fig. 1b). The calculated result shows that CoP3 has a semi-conductive characteristic with a very narrow band-gap, which is consistent with the experimental results [47]. The CoP3 shows good conductivity at room temperature, which is beneficial for the electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process. Since hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy is a key factor of HER electrocatalytic activity, the hydrogen adsorption on different low-Miller-index surfaces of CoP3, including (100), (001), (111), (011), (110) and (211), have been calculated by using periodic DFT. The ΔGH⁎ for an ideal HER electrocatalyst for the HER should be close to 0 eV [48,49], because the ΔGH⁎ close to 0 eV is favorable for the balance between the ease of removal of adsorbed hydrogen from the surface and the rate of proton reduction [50]. CoP3 nanostructures that expose different surfaces would be expected to exhibit different performance for HER electrocatalysis. As shown in Fig. 8 , the ΔGH⁎ of CoP3 at (111) surface is 0.56 eV, indicating that HER electrocatalytic process can hardly be achieved on (111) surface due to the unfavorable interaction with H. Moreover, the ΔGH⁎ of CoP3 at (001) and (100) is −0.93 and − 0.64 eV, respectively, implying a strong interaction with H, which may lead to poor HER activity due to the foreseeable difficulty in hydrogen release. However, CoP3 at (110), (011) and (211) give a ΔGH⁎ close to 0 eV, possessing the highest electrocatalytic performance among these surfaces. Moreover, we calculate the ΔGH⁎ on different adsorption site including P top site, Co top site and CoP bridge site, revealing that the hydrogen atom adsorption on CoP bridge site is the most stable system, indicating the synergy of proximal Co and P atoms on the surface can result in a better HER activity. In addition, the hydrogen adsorption on CoP bridge site forms asymmetric CoH and PH bond which is favorable desorption to release H2. Overall, the synergy of proximal Co and P atoms on the surface can result in an improved HER activity."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, 3-D CoP3 NPAs integrated on CC are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal and topotactic phosphidation method. On the basis of the above results, the 3-D CoP3 NPAs exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance over a wide range of pH, and the reasons for such enhanced electrocatalytic performance can be summarized as follows: (1) the array structure and rough surface of CoP3 NPAs/CC offer a large surface area, which can provide higher active site number; (2) phosphorous-rich character of CoP3 provides great intrinsic catalytic activity; (3) nearly metallic CoP3 NPAs have a good conductivity which facilitates fast electron transport; (4) The asymmetric CoH and PH bonds as well as the low hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy promote the adsorption and desorption of H atom to form H2. Herein, we demonstrate that with earth-abundant components, facile preparation, extraordinary activity over a wide pH range, and excellent durability the nearly metallic CoP3 NPAs offer a promising alternative of non-PGM catalysts for energy conversion and storage applications."
