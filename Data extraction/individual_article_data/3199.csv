0,Introduction,"Under the concept of sustainable development, H2 energy as a renewable alternative energy source for fossil fuels has attracted more and more attention because of its clean and efficient characteristics [1–3]. H2 evolution via photocatalytic water splitting using solar power is supposed to be an attractive way toward green energy sources for the future [4–7]. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials have provoked wide attention due to the high specific surface area, distinctive physicochemical properties, and large number of coordination unsaturated surface atoms [8–12]. Among these, K+CNO− NSs is a typical 2D semiconductor material, which derives from the Dion-Jacobson phase KCa2Nb3O10 by exfoliation with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide [13]. Notably, the K+CNO‒ produce the photoexcited charge under light irradiation have a strong reduction ability because of the existence of high-energy Nb 4d orbital [14]. However, the intrinsic large band gap limit (about 3.46 eV) and the high photon-generated carriers recombination efficiency restricted their practical application [15]. Therefore, it is desirable to develop an effective way to reduce the recombination efficiency and enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of K+CNO− NSs photocatalyst. To solve this issue, co-catalyst modification is usually used as one of the most efficient methods to enhance photocatalytic activity, which can boost the separation of photogenerated charges, promote the charge interface transfer and offer active sites for photocatalytic reactions [16–20]. Especially, noble metals (Pt, Ru, Pd, etc.) are used as the co-catalysts to boost the photogenerated charges transfer and act as active sites for the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity [21]. However, the expensive cost seriously limits their practical applications [22]. Therefore, it is quite significance to develop cost-effective and earth-abundance co-catalysts to achieve high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Transition metal carbides have attracted more and more attention because of its prominent photocatalytic performance in many photocatalytic reactions [23–28]. In recent years, transition metal carbides such as Co2C [29], WC [30], Ti2C [31] and Ti3C [32,33] have been used as photocatalytic co-catalysts for H2 production. Among them, Mo2C is an attractive transition metal carbides due to the outstanding adsorption capacity, electrical conductivity, and excellent thermal stability [34,35]. More importantly, Mo2C has a similar electronic density of state with Pt, which makes it can instead of Pt as a co-catalyst in many photocatalytic reactions [36]. Unfortunately, the performance of Mo2C as co-catalyst does not achieve the expectation in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction due to the low exposed active surface [37]. It is expected that the integration of 2D K+CNO− NSs with Mo2C nanoparticles will enhance the surface reaction kinetics and guarantee the exposure of Mo2C active surface, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production activity. Here, we for the first time developed a self-assembly method to prepare the Mo2C NPs co-catalyst decorated K+CNO− NSs as an efficient heterojunction photocatalyst. In this work, noble-metal-free Mo2C was acted as active sites to accelerate the surface reactivity for proton reduction. The optimal Mo2C/K+CNO‒ sample exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate, which is about 8.8 times higher than that of bare K+CNO− NSs. The outstanding photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the faster photogenerated electrons transfer resulted from the ultrathin structure of K+CNO− NSs and the effective charge carrier separation originated from the abundant heterointerfaces. Our work provides a new strategy to construct non-noble metal co-catalyst system for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."

All reagents were utilized as received without any further purification."
3,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.2 Photocatalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of perovskite oxide K+CNO− nanosheets The perovskite oxide K+CNO− nanosheets were synthesized according to previous report [38]. Firstly, the synthetic process of parent bulk material KCa2Nb3O10 was as follows. An exact mole ratio of Nb2O5, K2CO3, and CaCO3 (K+:Ca2+:Nb5+ = 1.1:2:3) were grinded enough in an agate mortar. The mixed powder was heated at 1200 °C for 10 h to get parent bulk material KCa2Nb3O10. Secondly, the obtained KCa2Nb3O10 was added into HNO3 (5 mol·L‒1) solution for 3 days by continuous stir in order to replace K+ in the interlayer space with H+ to obtain proton-exchanged material (HCa2Nb3O10). Finally, 0.1 g of HCa2Nb3O10 was dispersed into 0.5 mL of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution 10% (TBA+OH-) and 100 mL of H2O by assistance with ultrasound and agitation for 7 days to produce colloidal suspension at room temperature. Subsequently, the colloidal suspension was added into KCl solution (2 mol·L‒1, 100 mL) drop by drop and then the white precipitation (perovskite oxide K+Ca2Nb3O10 − nanosheets) was washed by centrifugation with deionized water and ethanol, the K+Ca2Nb3O10 − nanosheets dried at 60 °C in air. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Mo2C nanoparticles The Mo2C nanoparticle was synthesized according to previous report [39]. Typically, 1 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and excess glucose were added into 50 mL of deionized water by assistance of magnetic stir for 30 min. Subsequently, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After that, the precipitates were washed by centrifugation with deionized water and ethanol, the products dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. Finally, the resulting solid powers were heated at 850 °C and lasting 3 h in 10% H2/Ar at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 to get the Mo2C nanoparticles. 2.2.3 Synthesis of a series of Mo2C/K+CNO− The fabrication of the composite was carried out by adding different mass ratios of Mo2C (0.5, 1, 3 and 5 wt.%) to K+Ca2Nb3O10 − nanosheets dispersion dropwise in 30 mL of deionized water and stirring at room temperature for 2 h, followed by centrifugation, washing and drying to obtain the target product Mo2C/K+Ca2Nb3O10 −heterojunction photocatalyst. Finally, the samples with different mass ratios were denoted as 0.5% MK, 1% MK, 3% MK and 5% MK."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphologies of the samples were investigated by using a JEOL FEIJEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken with a Shimadzu XRD-6100 X-ray diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the 2θ range of 10−80° at a scanning rate of 7° min−1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer was measured with a Bruker A300−10/12 spectrometer at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performing on an ESCA PHI500 spectrometer. UV–vis absorption spectra were conducted with aShimadzu UV-3600Plus UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (DRS) using BaSO4 powder as a reference. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out with a TriStar II 3020 surface area (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA) at 77 K. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm were conducted using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky were investigated by a CHI660B electrochemical analyzer in a standard three-electrode system, where Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively, and the samples were used as working electrodes. The electrolytes of EIS analysis was 0.1 mol·L−1 KCl solution containing 5 mmol·L−1 K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6]. The electrolyte of Mott–Schottky measurements was 0.1 mol·L−1 Na2SO4 solution."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen generation properties,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation properties The photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out with a Labsolar 6A online trace gas analysis system (Perfectlight, Beijing). Typically, 50 mg of the photocatalysts were suspended in methanol aqueous solution (20 vol%, 100 mL) as a sacrificial agent. After the photocatalytic reaction reactor was evacuated to remove air, the solution was irradiated by a 300 W Xe-lamp as the light source. The produced gas mixed was detected by a GC7900 II gas chromatograph (Tian Mei, Shanghai) with a 5 Å molecular sieve column and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using N2 as carrier. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured and calculated according to the following Eq. (1)[40]: (1) A Q E ( % ) = N u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s N u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 = N u m b e r o f e v o l v e d h y d r o g e n m o l e c u l e s × 2 N u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structures and morphologies of as-prepared samples,"3.1 Structures and morphologies of as-prepared samples Fig. 1 a shows the synthetic process of Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst. The morphologies of the Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst were observed by TEM and HR-TEM. As shown in Fig. 1b, the TEM image of K+CNO− NSs reveals the typical 2D nanosheet. The Mo2C NPs were successfully loaded on the K+CNO− NSs, and attaining intimate contact between Mo2C NPs and K+CNO− NSs (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, a series of Mo2C/K+CNO− nanocomposites with a different of Mo2C NPs content were depicted in Fig. S1a-c. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 1d displays the lattice fringes of 0.276 and 0.302 nm corresponding to (110) and (020) planes of K+CNO− and Mo2C, respectively, confirming the Mo2C NPs are implanted on K+CNO− NSs. Fig. 1e is an elemental-mapping image of the 3% MK reveal the coexistence of Ca, Nb, O, and Mo elements, which further indicates that Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst were successfully synthesized. The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 2 . XRD patterns (Fig. 2a) of KCa2Nb3O10 (JCPDS#35−1294), HCa2Nb3O10 (JCPDS#40−0884) and Mo2C (JCPDS#71−0242) are consistent with previous reports, respectively [39,41,42]. Obviously, the characteristic diffraction peaks of K+CNO− NSs corresponding to (100), (110), (200) and (210) facets are wider than those of HCa2Nb3O10 and some peaks disappear, confirming the disappearance of three-dimensional (3D) structure [43]. As shown in Fig. 2b, all of the diffraction peaks of Mo2C/K+CNO− samples are ascribed to the K+CNO−. The absence of the characteristic peaks of Mo2C could be attributed to their very low content and high dispersity in the Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst. Furthermore, the EPR spectra of K+CNO‒ and 3% MK in Fig. S2 exhibited that there is no obvious other new signals appear after Mo2C nanoparticles were decorated, which indicate no obvious change of coordination unsaturated surface atoms in the K+CNO‒. XPS analysis was also employed to investigate the surface valence states and elemental composition. Two typical peaks at 346.35 and 349.95 eV in K+CNO− NSs were assigned to Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2 (Fig. 3 a), respectively. [44]. As shown in Fig. 3b, two characteristic peaks of Nb 3d over K+CNO‒ NSs, located at about 206.60 and 209.30 eV, assign to Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 binding energies, respectively. It is obvious that the Ca 2p and Nb 3d of 3% MK shift to higher binding energy, which further confirm the existence of strong electronic interactions between Mo2C NPS and K+CNO‒ NSs [45]. As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, two peaks at 227.70 and 231.95 eV in 3% MK were assigned to the Mo2+ 3d5/2 and Mo 3d5/2, and the peaks at 232.34 and 235.28 eV correspond to the Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2 in MoO3, probably due to exposure in air [46,47]. Fig. 3d shows the XPS spectrum of the carbon species, the peaks at 284.27, 284.98, 286.19, 288.46 eV were assigned to the carbide carbon, sp2-hybridized aromatic carbon (CC bond), CO bond, and CO bond, which indicates the co-existence of C residues [48]. All the above result indicates that the Mo2C/K+CNO‒ heterojunction photocatalyst with strong interfacial interaction were successfully synthesized."
8,Optical and electronic properties,"3.2 Optical and electronic properties Fig. 4 a illustrates the UV–vis DRS of bare K+CNO− NSs and Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst. The K+CNO− NSs have a basic absorption edge at about 360 nm. With the increasing amount of Mo2C NPs, light absorption intensity of the sample is improved. The result indicates that the enhanced photo-absorption of Mo2C/K+CNO− samples in the wavelength from 400 to 800 nm is due to the addition of Mo2C NPs. The BET surface area of the Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst sample was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4b, the BET surfaces of K+CNO− and 3% MK are 136.04 and 139.42 m2 g‒1. The pore sizes of K+CNO− and 3% MK are 5.65 and 5.46 nm, respectively. This slight enhanced BET surface area after loading of Mo2C nanoparticles on the K+CNO− surface may not the crucial factor that determines the photocatalytic hydrogen activity. In order to study the reasons for the improved photocatalytic performance of Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst, the steady-state PL spectra were recorded to evaluate the separation of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 4c). The PL intensity of 3% MK was lower than that of bare K+CNO‒ NSs, which indicated that the introduction of Mo2C NPs increased the ability to inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in K+CNO− NSs [49,50]. Fig. 4d shows the EIS Nyquist plots bare K+CNO‒ NSs and 3% MK heterojunction photocatalyst-based electrodes. In general, the charge transfer resistance is a function of semicircle curvature diameter. The smaller diameter corresponds to lower resistance. The arc radius of 3% MK decreases obviously after loading Mo2C onto K+CNO− NSs, implying that the charge transfer and transport resistance is reduced due to the introduction of Mo2C NPs which has the high electrical conductivity."
9,Photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity As show in Fig. 5 a-b, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of bare K+CNO− NSs and Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst was analysed without the assistance of any other noble metal. The activity of H2 generation of bare 2D K+CNO‒ NSs is only approximately 78.1 μmol g‒1 within 5 h, stemming from its rapid photo-generated charge carriers recombination. However, with different loading ratios of Mo2C NPs onto K+CNO‒ NSs, the activity of H2 generation is obviously enhanced. When the Mo2C NPs loading is 3 wt%, the activity of H2 generation reaches a maximum value of 686.5 μmol g‒1 within 5 h, nearly 8.8 times that of bare K+CNO‒ NSs. The optimized sample demonstrates an AQE value of 2.23% at 350 nm. Interestingly, the present photocatalytic H2 generation activity is in essence comparable to or greater than a number of literature reports on two-dimensional photocatalysts (Table S1). The reusability and durability of a photocatalyst is crucial for practical application of photocatalytic H2 production. As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocatalytic activity of 3% MK photocatalyst is slightly decreased after the 5th run. As revealed by the XPS spectra of the spent 3% MK photocatalysts (Fig. S3), the proportion of Mo6+ increases, indicating that part of Mo2C NPs is oxidized, which is the probable reason for the decrease in photocatalytic. In addition, the results of XRD (Fig. 5d) and TEM (Fig. S4) characterizations also achieved by after the reaction, there were no obvious other new peaks and changes, which indicate the crystal phase structure of photocatalysts remained unchanged. Although the structural stability of the photocatalyst, the catalyst may shed a small part of Mo2C NPs under continuous strong agitation, which may be another reason for the decrease of photocatalytic activity."
10,Possible photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Possible photocatalytic mechanism The band gap energy estimated from the Tauc plots is shown in Fig. S5a, the estimated band gap energy of K+CNO− nanosheets is 3.46 eV. Fig. S5b shows the Mott-Schottky plots of K+CNO−, the apparent positive slopes of the plots revealed that K+CNO− is an n-type semiconductor. Besides, the flat band potential (E fb ) of K+CNO− is approximately −1.25 V. The E fb (vs. NHE, pH = 0) of K+CNO− can be estimated to be −0.65 (E fb = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.197 V) [51]. Since the rule of thumb dictates that the E fb are about 0.3 V below conduction band (CB) [52], thus CB of K+CNO− is −0.95 V. Therefore, the valence band (VB) is 2.51 V. On the basis of the above analysis, a possible mechanism for photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction over the Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst is described in Fig. 6 a-b. Upon light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons transfer from the VB of K+CNO‒ NSs to its CB, and the photoexcited holes left in the VB. Then, photoexcited electrons in the CB of K+CNO‒ NSs transfer to Mo2C NPs surfaces via heterojunction interface and reduce protons into molecular H2. Meanwhile, photoexcited holes in the VB are quenched with methyl alcohol as a sacrificial electron donor. Therefore, the exposed Mo2C NPs function as co-catalysts provide more surface active-site for photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction, and the structure of Mo2C/K+CNO‒ heterojunction interfaces is beneficial to improve separation efficiency of charge carriers."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, we researched the use of noble-metal-free K+CNO−-based photocatalysts for H2 evolution reaction by loading Mo2C NPs on K+CNO− NSs. By comparison to bare K+CNO− NSs, the as-prepared Mo2C/K+CNO− heterojunction photocatalyst showed superior photocatalytic H2 production performance. The 3 wt% Mo2C NPs co-catalysts-modified K+CNO− NSs recorded a maximum H2 generation of 686.5 μmol g‒1 with an AQE value of 2.23% at 350 nm. The improved H2 generation performance of the Mo2C/K+CNO− photocatalyst attribute to the efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and charge transfer in a shortened distance. This research provides a promising strategy to develop low-cost, high-efficiency photocatalyst."
