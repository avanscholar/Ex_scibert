0,Introduction,"The development of catalysts and processes for transforming hydrocarbons into hydrogen has been under development for many decades [1–3]. These processes for reacting hydrocarbons with an oxidant, such as steam or oxygen, and maximizing the production of hydrogen are implemented within the industry and are to be considered an established technology, even though small improvements with respect to catalysts and process conditions are made on a continuous basis. Hydrogen is one of the most important base-chemicals and is mainly used in the production of ammonia-based fertilizers and for reacting heavy petroleum fractions into lighter, more useful ones. Alternative methods for hydrogen generation include electrolysis of water, splitting it into oxygen and hydrogen, and there are many examples of this technology in implementation. Other recent developments for hydrogen production include the use of photosynthesis in micro-organisms such as cyanobacteria or microalgae, or indeed using enzymes for performing the same [4,5]. However, increasing costs of hydrocarbons, energy security and the impact of carbon dioxide emissions have spurred the development of smaller scale hydrogen generators [6]. These hydrogen generators are primarily aimed for using in conjunction with fuel cells, which will yield higher overall energy utilisation by avoiding Carnot-cycle limitations [7]. This can be done either for transportation purposes, where the hydrogen production can be performed either in the vehicle [7], so called on-board reforming, or the hydrogen may be produced and purified at a separate site, allowing for hydrogen refuelling [8]. Another purpose is for local production of electricity using various types of fuel cells, such as alkaline fuel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells [9]. Independent of the use of the hydrogen, the hydrocarbon starting material will have to be transformed into hydrogen and this is performed through a series of reactions. First of all, the hydrocarbon needs to be reacted with an oxidant to form carbon monoxide. This can be performed using either oxygen or steam, or both in conjunction (Eqs. 1–4), depending on the oxidants used the reactions are designated different names; for each reaction the ΔH0 or the reaction enthalpy difference between reactants and products is denoted. If steam alone is used the reaction is called steam reforming, if oxygen alone is used the reaction is called partial oxidation and the combined reaction with steam and oxygen is called auto-thermal reforming or oxidative steam reforming [9]. Steam reforming (SR) (1) CH 4 + H 2 O = CO + 3 H 2 Δ H 0 = 201 kJ / mol (2) C m H n + m H 2 O = m CO + ( m + 0.5 n ) H 2 Partial oxidation (POX) (3) CH 4 + 0.5 O 2 = CO + 2 H 2 Δ H 0 = − 35.7 kJ / mol (4) C m H n + 0.5 m O 2 = m CO + 0.5 n H 2 The steam reforming is net endothermic and heat thus need to be added for performing the reaction, in partial oxidation heat is generated and for auto-thermal reforming, no external heat is required for the reaction. Which reaction that is preferred is mainly depending on the requirements of the system being designed [7]. To further increase the yield of hydrogen, a water-gas shift reaction is performed (Eq. (5)). Water-gas shift (WGS) (5) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 0 = − 44 kJ / mol As can be noted the water-gas shift reaction is mildly exothermic and heat removal is required for increasing the yield due to equilibrium effects. In the industry, the reaction is usually divided into two reaction steps, denoted high and low-temperature shift. In Fig. 1 the equilibrium for the water-gas shift and the traditional reactions are depicted. Depending on the application, there are different requirements on the hydrogen quality with respect to contaminants. If the end-use is refuelling, the hydrogen has to be purified with respect to carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide and sulphur, as well as most other trace contaminants. This is mainly performed using pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) or membrane technology, with the PSA being the dominating technology at present [10–12]. If the use is a direct integration into a fuel cell system, the purification is mainly due to the type of fuel cell used, Table 1 [13–15]. The most considered fuel cell for transportation and stationary use today seem to be the proton-exchange membrane fuel cell [15–19]. This puts a requirement on the levels of carbon monoxide present in the gas reaching the fuel cell to below 10 ppm. The levels of carbon monoxide can be reduced by chemical means through the use of catalysts promoting either the CO methanation reaction or the CO oxidation reaction into CO2 (Eqs. (6)–(7)). The two methods have different advantages and disadvantages that need to be reviewed in the design process. Methanation (METH) (6) CO + 3 H 2 = CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H 0 = − 201 kJ / mol Preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) (7) CO + 0.5 O 2 = CO 2 Δ H 0 = − 285 kJ / mol In designing small-scale hydrogen generation system there are a number of parameters to take into account, including the end-use of the gas, power output, fuel-type etc. and going through all these trade-offs are not within the scope of this paper, these matters have however been reviewed and discussed elsewhere [7,20] and the alternatives have been outlined in Fig. 2 . There is however one important design factor that has been left out of Fig. 2 and this is the sulphur removal. The presence of sulphur in the feedstock is principally unavoidable, unless synthetic diesel or alcohols are used. Sulphur is a poison for most, if not all, fuel cells and it is a requisite that it is removed before it reaches the fuel cell itself. Sulphur is however not only detrimental to the fuel cell, it will also have an adverse effect on the catalysts in the system. The catalysts normally considered for reforming (SR, POX, ATR) are Ni-based and the water-gas shift catalyst is either FeCr-based (high-temperature shift) or CuZn-based (low-temperature shift) [1–3]. These catalysts are all negatively affected by the presence of sulphur with the Ni and Cu-based catalysts irreversibly impacted [3,21,22]; indeed this has led to much work on the interaction of sulphur and metal surfaces [23–32]. Given the number of systems designed with the purpose of producing high-purity hydrogen for fuel cell systems, there is a need in the hydrogen community to better understand the number of realistic design-options at hand. The designing of a small-scale system is quite a different task than designing a traditional, large-scale production plan and other trade-offs are important than in the larger scale case. There is however a general statement that holds true in both cases: from a system design perspective the more degrees-of-freedom the better. This means that with catalysts that can tolerate low to medium levels of sulphur in the gas, less concern is required with respect to sulphur and more emphasis may be put on other aspects such as efficiency etc. The removal of sulphur is also complicated when using non-gaseous fuels, especially if traditional catalysts are to be used, which may require liquid-phase desulphurisation, which may not be practically implementable in the small-scale. Indeed, the operation with sulphur present has been identified as a key factor by several authors in implementing small-scale hydrocarbon-based hydrogen production [9,32–34] and especially when liquid fuels are targeted [35–37]; with this said a large majority of the fuel cell systems in operation today have some kind of sulphur removal prior to the catalytic conversion. With this in mind, the development of sulphur resistant catalyst for all catalytic reactions in hydrogen production has been reviewed to give system and catalyst designers a starting point for discussion and future work, as well as an understanding from the system designer’s point-of-view for what is possible with respect to sulphur-laden operation. The paper is written from a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell perspective, but the reforming steps are relevant also for the other types of fuel cells listed in Table 1. The CO clean-up steps have been included for completion and to not impose limitations on system designs; these steps may also be required to handle sulphur at system upsets even though it is considered unlikely that a sulphur breakthrough is severe enough to reach these stages."
1,Catalysts,"The catalysts that are included in the reforming of hydrocarbons into hydrogen will be discussed from a sulphur tolerance perspective following the same order as they would in the actual process train. This means that the reforming catalysts (SR, POX and ATR) will be discussed first, followed by the water-gas shift and the CO clean-up catalysts."
2,Reforming,"2.1 Reforming In this section, the development of the various reforming catalysts will be reviewed with respect to sulphur, starting with the SR as it is the industry standard for large-scale production and continuing with POX and ATR. 2.1.1 Steam reforming The catalyst traditionally used in SR is based on nickel metal dispersed on refractory oxides such as α-alumina and MgAl2O4 [1–3] and the process operate at high-temperature and a space velocity of 3000 to 8000 h−1 [38]. There are several reviews dealing with the challenges of SR catalysts in the traditional sense [35,39] among these, four challenges of SR nickel catalysts have been identified. They are activity, sulphur poisoning, carbon formation and sintering [39] and the presence of sulphur has also been found to negatively influence the nickel sintering [40] as well as carbon deposition [41]. The deactivation of catalysts is usually done through the contact of the catalyst with hydrogen sulphide, however other sulphur-containing organic species and their impact on catalyst activities can be found elsewhere [42,43]. For the small-scale production of hydrogen, there are two alternatives in achieving a sulphur resistant operation. One may use traditional nickel-based catalysts, but with dopants to increase the sulphur resistance or one may turn to other metals, such as noble metals. A comparison of the reduced metals usually considered for reforming with respect to metal-sulphide formation can be viewed in Fig. 3 . As can be viewed in the figure, the base-metals (Ni and Co) are more shifted towards the metal sulphides then the other metals considered. Indeed, the noble metals display almost an order of magnitude lower sulphide formation at a given hydrogen-to-hydrogen sulphide ratio. There is also a temperature effect involved and the higher the temperature the lower the equilibrium concentration of sulphide. With this said, there are not only thermodynamics to take into account but also kinetics and surface-cover phenomena [44]. The equilibrium composition of the sulphide is only a guideline in developing sulphur-tolerant catalysts. Some of the metals in Fig. 3, such as Ru display quite low equilibrium composition of the sulphide phases (at least compared to the base-metals) but is permanently deactivated when exposed to sulphur in SR, in a way that Rh is not [32]. Fig. 4 Most of the catalysts that have been developed for small-scale reforming of sulphur-containing fuels are noble-metal based and have been done so with the purpose of reforming liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene; some sulphur-tolerant catalysts have been mentioned in the literature, but with proprietary compositions [7,32,36]. In the paper by Farrauto et al. [32] a Rh–Pt based catalyst displayed more than 12 h stable operation under 5 ppm sulphur conditions. The use of noble-metals is a good choice from an activity and sulphur tolerance point-of-view [34,38], but have a cost drawback. The SR of iso-octane was investigated by Lu et al. with a series of 1.5 wt% Pt catalysts supported on Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 catalysts [45]. The researchers investigated the activity of the catalysts, calcined at 600 °C, 800 °C and 1000 °C, for activity without and with 300 μg/g sulphur in the form of thiophene. Whereas the catalyst calcined at both 600 °C and 800 °C showed high conversion of iso-octane in sulphur-free environment (at 750 °C, 0.1 MPa and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3), the catalyst calcined at the lower temperature deactivated rather rapidly over time (from 100% iso-octane conversion to 70% in 60 h on-stream). The catalyst calcined at 800 °C however retained its ability to convert the iso-octane during a full 100 h on-stream test. In the same paper, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy revealed strongly electron-deficient Pt sites immune to sulphur poisoning in the catalyst calcined at 800 °C. A similar catalyst carrier system, ceria with Gd2O3 and ZrO2 doping was investigated by Azad and Duran, with different noble-metals and promoters over 12 h of operation [46]. Interestingly, one of their rhodium-based catalyst series shows a higher hydrogen yield in the presence of sulphur (50 ppm sulphur-laden toluene) than without the sulphur present at 825 °C and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3. The addition of CuO as a dopant also seems to improve the stability and performance of the catalyst, but this may be an effect of adding a sacrificial sulphidation site. The Rh and Rh with metal oxides added to them all outperformed their Pd-counterparts. This type of system was also investigated by McCoy et al. for a number of noble metals and metal oxide dopants [47]. The noble metals considered were Pd and Rh with addition of CuO and Y2O3 and the carriers were doped with gadolina (10 mol% or zirconia 25 mol%). The first conclusion from the study is that the mixture of the two noble-metals has higher activity than the individual ones under sulphur-free operation of toluene SR. With respect to sulphur-laden operation, the Pd based catalyst display the highest sensitivity, the Rh one low sensitivity to sulphur and the mixed Rh-Pd catalyst little or no sensitivity to the 50 ppm sulphur in the SR of toluene; at least not during 12 h of operation. The effect of some catalysts showing a higher activity under sulphur-rich conditions that was reported in the Azad and Duran study [46] was repeated again in this study for the gadolina doped ceria carriers. It is speculated in the paper that this effect may be due to the formation of rhodium sulphides and that the sulphide may be highly active for hydrocarbon SR; however the catalyst displayed a deactivation over 24 h on-stream from 100% conversion to 65% conversion, this deactivation however also occurred with sulphur-free operating conditions. The addition of CuO improved the yield of hydrogen for both Pd and Rh catalysts but the catalysts displayed deactivation with time-on-stream; the addition of Y2O3 improved stability of both Rh and Pd-based catalysts. With respect to the zirconia doped catalysts, the results were less promising. A Pd catalyst supported on zirconia was used by Goud et al. for the SR of n-hexadecane in an investigation of the deactivation kinetics [48]. The catalyst showed significant deactivation behaviour with time-on-stream (15 h) and the rate of deactivation was concluded to be proportional to the sulphur content in the gas stream. The SR of kerosene was investigated by Suzuki et al. using a highly dispersed Ru catalyst supported on an alumina carrier with 200 m2/g BET surface area [49]. The catalysts were promoted with ceria, yttria and lanthania and investigated for SR both with desulphurised and sulphur-containing kerosene (51 ppm). The results show that adding ceria to the catalyst resulted in a slower reduction in kerosene conversion than with the other promoters (about 20% conversion drop over 25 h compared to about 45% conversion drop), with lanthania and yttria promoted catalyst performed better than the un-promoted catalyst. In a more recent paper [50], Azad and Sundararajan performed more work on gadolina-promoted ceria reforming catalysts. It was again confirmed that Pd performed worse than Ru and Rh, never showing stable reforming during 60 h of operation with kerosene containing 260 ppm sulphur; the other two catalysts displayed relatively stable performance for about 60 h, at which point in time the activity severely decreases. The catalyst loss-of-activity is, according to the authors, mainly due to sulphur poisoning and not carbon deposition on the surface. Another study by Laosiripojana et al. investigates the SR over only the ceria support doped with Gd, Y, Nb, La and Sm [51]. It was found that the formation of various Ce–O–S phases, sulphates and sulphides, affected the methane SR reaction rate, with the sulphates having a positive effect on oxygen storage capacity and lattice oxygen mobility and the sulphides a negative effect. As an alternative to using noble-metal based catalysts, the sulphur resistance of the traditional nickel catalyst may be attempted to be increased. Wang et al. increased the sulphur tolerance by supporting nickel on a ZSM-5 zeolite and by preparing bi-metallic Ni–Re, Ni–Co and Ni–Mo catalysts [37]; however without reporting the catalyst performance on-stream under sulphur-laden conditions. The use of a ceria ion-exchanged ZSM-5 catalyst with 5 wt% nickel content showed high activity in steam reforming of kerosene and displayed little sensitivity to 20 ppm of sulphur. The activity of a traditional Ni-catalyst was also improved by adding second metals in the form of Re, Co and Mo, with Re displaying the most promising results with both high activity and promising sulphur tolerance. In a series of papers, Xie et al. investigates the influence of sulphur on SR of liquid hydrocarbons for ceria-alumina Ni, Rh and Ni–Rh catalysts [52,53]. Neither of the catalysts containing nickel was stable in a sulphur-laden environment, even though the Ni–Rh catalyst was deactivated less quickly; over 60 h on-stream. The research also showed that the carbon deposition was increased with sulphur present in the gas stream and that this effect was more pronounced with respect to nickel. The deactivation by sulphur poisoning and carbon deposits on Rh–Ni supported on alumina was also investigated by Lakhapatri and Abraham [54]. The same increase in cocking with sulphur present was demonstrated in a recent paper by Simson et al. [55]. In the paper a commercial bi-metallic Pt–Rh catalyst supported on zirconia was investigated for the SR of ethanol/gasoline mixtures. Without sulphur present in the gas stream, the conversion of ethanol was stable at 100% for over 100 h; with 5 ppm sulphur in the gas, the conversion rapidly dropped after 22 h on-stream. The catalyst could be regenerated by calcination but subsequent deactivation occurred faster after the first account of carbon formation. There has also been work performed by Cheekatamarla and Thomson [56,57] on the catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide for diesel reforming during 5 h on-stream. It was found that this carbide catalyst was stable above 965 °C under SR conditions and that the reforming of paraffin’s worked well but that aromatic reforming was more troublesome. The catalyst was permanently deactivated by 500 wppm sulphur, but could be regenerated and restored to original condition by 1 h at 900 °C in He. For increasing the understanding of the sulphur effects of the molybdenum carbide and Pt supported molybdenum carbide, investigations with methanol reforming was performed [58]. It was discovered that the catalyst activity levelled out at about 60% with respect to conversion and the activity was restorable to 100% (Mo2C) and 15% (Pt/Mo2C) respectively. Apart from the small-scale generation of hydrogen, the gasification of biomass and its subsequent upgrading to carbonaceous fuel is requiring sulphur-tolerant catalyst for reforming (SR, POX and ATR are all considered), spurring the development [59–64]. The patent literature also holds example of other nickel and non-nickel based sulphur-tolerant catalysts [65–92]. There are also publications dealing with sulphur-tolerant pre-reforming i.e. low-temperature decomposition of long-chain hydrocarbons [93,94]. 2.1.2 Partial oxidation The catalytic partial oxidation of hydrocarbons is a reaction that can be performed with high kinetics; quick light-off and transient response [95]. There are several reviews covering various aspects of POX such as catalysts and reaction mechanisms and the catalyst range from base-metals such as cobalt and nickel to noble metals such as iridium, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium [95,96]. Aside from issues with catalyst poisoning and carbon formation, the POX reaction is also performed at higher temperatures than SR and ATR, making catalyst sintering and stability a larger issue. Several research groups has suggested incorporating the active metal in different types of crystal-structures to enhance metal dispersion and improve sulphur resistance; indeed a sintering of a supported nickel leads to larger crystallites that are more easily poisoned [97,98]. One class of such structures is hexaaluminates into which Ni or other metals are substituted [99,100]. The findings of Haynes et al., was that the Ni-hexaaluminate (3 wt% Ni) in POX of 1-methylnaphtalene with 50 ppm dibenzothiophene initially lost its activity faster than a reference Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, probably due to fewer active sites. However, Smith et al. showed that by dispersing the Ni-hexaaluminate on a zirconia doped ceria, the activity could be maintained under similar testing conditions during 5 h of testing [101]. The mirror cations in the hexaluminate was concluded by Gardner et al. [102] to have an influence on the nickel-site blocking with La/Ni-hexaaluminates experiencing more site blocking than Sr/Ni-hexaaluminates due to the coordination of the Ni atoms. The same research group also investigated a series of pyrochlore-based catalysts for their activity and sulphur resistance [100,102,103]. A La/Sr/Zr/Ni-pyrochlore in POX of 1-methylnaphtalene with 50 ppm dibenzothiophene initially lost its activity but did not display a continuous deactivation with time-on-stream for 4 h [100]. This suggests that the sites involved in forming H2 and CO does not become continuously deactivated, suggesting that the reactants upon adsorbing on the surface only lower the turnover frequency of the active sites but not accumulating on the surface itself. It is believed that the catalyst can retain its catalytic properties due to the enhanced oxygen-ion transport ability resulting from Sr addition [102]. In removing the sulphur in the feed, some of the initial activity is restored, showing that the sulphur effect is reversible; albeit not fully reversible, indicating some permanent deactivation. With similar types of catalysts, but with Rh as the active phase in the pyrochlore lattice instead of Ni, similar results were obtained [103]. The sulphur in the feed lowered the catalyst activity, however, the pyrochlore loss-of-activity was slower than a reference Rh/Al2O3 during the 4 h of testing; the sulphur present also increased the carbon formation on the catalyst, but less so on the pyrochlore catalyst containing Sr. Another catalyst of interest for POX with sulphur present seems to be MoO2, investigated by Marin-Flores et al. [104,105]. The POX of n-decane was investigated with levels of benzothiophene ranging from 1000 ppmw to 3000 ppmw during 7 h on-stream [105]. The catalyst seem to handle the 1000 ppmw rather well at 850 °C, with only a small loss in hydrogen and CO yields, but still with full conversion; the balance was accredited to an increase in carbon formation. Further investigations showed that the catalyst remained in the oxygen state, with only small amounts of sulphide formation. Molybdenum, but in its carbide form has also been investigated during 10 h for the POX of methane [106]. Over this catalyst, a change in phase from carbide to sulphide was observed with more than 0.1 wt% of H2S in the gas. With lower than 0.1 wt% H2S in the gas, there was no change in the catalyst morphology, but the activity was decreased due to increased carbon formation on the catalyst surface. Another investigation of a Co–Mo carbide catalyst [107] showed that the POX of n-tetradecane with 50 ppmw dibenzothiophene had little effect on the catalyst activity and selectivity for 5 h on-stream; adding higher levels of sulphur deactivated the catalyst, with activity returning faster to the carbide catalysts than the reference Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Other researchers have worked with supported noble-metal catalysts on different types of carriers. One of the preferred noble-metals seem to be Rh and Cimino et al. investigated the effects of substituting some of the Rh for Pt and Pd on La-Al2O3 supported catalysts during methane partial oxidation in sulphur-laden environment [108]. They found that adding Pt to the catalyst lowered the effects of the sulphur and that the sulphur preferably adsorbed on smaller well-dispersed Rh crystallites and not on larger metallic Rh. The same researchers also concluded in a different study [109] that the poisoning effect is independent from the sulphur-bearing compound and that the carrier, alumina stabilised by La or Si, only influenced the effect of sulphur through impacting the Rh dispersion. Bitsch-Larsen et al. investigated the sulphur effects in POX using Pt and Rh–Ce catalyst supported on Al2O3 and coated on foam monolith [110]. The research showed that introducing even small amounts of sulphur (14 ppm) significantly impacted the operation of the system. The catalyst temperature increased with 200 °C due to a loss in SR activity probably by limiting the H(s) and/or O(s) surface mobility and the conversion dropped. However, the addition of more sulphur (28 ppm) did not significantly change the behaviour. The authors also concluded that steam present in the gas did not significantly help in reducing the sulphur poisoning effects. Shekhawat et al. also investigated the effects of support and metal in the POX of n-tetradecane in the presence of sulphur [111]. It was reported that Rh on zirconia-doped ceria showed less sensitivity to sulphur in that after losing initial activity, it displayed stable production of CO and H2 for 2 h. The activity was restorable with the removal of the sulphur, but it is unclear whether the deactivation is caused directly by sulphur poisoning or indirectly by increased carbon formation. The use of Ni-based catalysts have also been investigated using ceria and magnesia carriers and adding cobalt to the active phase [112] as well as the effect of pulsing H2S into the reaction system [113]. There has also been some activity in the patenting field with respect to sulphur-tolerant POX catalyst [68,73,83,114–125]. 2.1.3 Auto-thermal reforming As mentioned in the introduction, the ATR is the balanced operation of SR and PO resulting in a more or less auto-thermal production of hydrogen. As in the two previous sections on SR and POX, there are examples in the literature of both base metals and noble metals as catalysts supported on various oxides as well as incorporated in crystal lattices. The perovskites, with the general formula ABO3, have been investigated by several research groups [126–129]. Qi et al. instigated the catalytic effect of La–Ce–Ni perovskites for the ATR of gasoline [128]. The catalyst showed good long-term stability (over 200 h of operation) and was almost immune to low concentrations of sulphur in the feed (5 ppmw); despite this, more sulphur seriously poisoned the catalyst. The improved sulphur and carbon formation resistance compared to a La-Ni perovskite was explained by increased oxygen mobility with the presence of sesquioxide ceria. Dinka and Mukasyan investigated a number of non-noble (M = K, Na, Li, Cs, Co, Mo) and noble metal (M = Pt, Pd, Ru, Re) additives in the B position in a La0.6Ce0.4Fe0.8− xNi0.2MxO3 perovskite [126]. The addition of potassium and ruthenium to the structure significantly increased the catalyst activity and led to stable performance; indeed, small amounts of sulphur (<10 ppmw) actually increased the activity. A similar study performed by Mawdsley and Krause [129] showed that in a LaNiO3 catalyst system, the addition of chromium yielded the best stabilisation with respect to sulphur tolerance (149 h of testing). Significant amounts of work have also been directed to the use of ceria, zirconia or mixed ceria/zirconia carriers for different base metal and noble metal catalysts [130–138]. Qi et al. showed that deactivation of Rh catalysts promoted with MgO and supported on a mixed ceria (20%) and zirconia carrier was worsened with respect to catalyst sintering and carbon formation with sulphur present in the gasoline feedstock. The catalysts regained their activity almost entirely when the sulphur-load in the feed was removed. In a series of papers [131,132] the performance of Pt supported on ceria was investigated. The reforming of synthetic diesel with about 10 ppm of sulphur was stable for more than 50 h; the same was however not true for commercial-grade JP8 with about 1000 ppm sulphur, which deactivated the catalyst from 80 to less than 60% hydrogen yield over 50 h. The deactivation was continuous but some of the deactivation was reversible, both when H2S and SO2 were used as sulphur compound. Xue et al. developed a Pt catalyst supported on gadolina, ceria and alumina carrier [133]. The Pt catalyst support comprising of 15% ceria and 1.6% gadolina displayed a remarkable ability to reform commercial-grade gasoline with 150–500 ppm sulphur. The conversion slowly went from 100% to 95–97% over the first 300 h of operation, at which point it stabilised for the reminding 700 h of testing. After the test, the catalyst contained less than 5w% carbon, less than a Pt counterpart without Gd did after 500 h of operation. Cheekatamarla and Lane showed that bi-metallic Pt-Pd metal as well as, surprisingly, Pt-Ni had better sulphur resistance over 50 h of testing than monometallic Pt when supported on ceria [135]. Murata et al. investigated Ni–Sr catalysts supported on zirconia with additional promoting with other metals such as Re and La out of which the Re doped catalyst showed stability over 100 h on-stream which none of the other catalysts in the study did [136]. Cheekatamarla and Thomson investigated the activity and poisoning effects of thiophene over molybdenum carbide catalysts [56,57]. It was found that the degree of deactivation was dependent on the sulphur concentration but was found to be minimal under concentrations of 100 ppmw benzothiophene in the ATR of hexadecane. This indicate that there is a significant difference in the performance with sulphur present when the catalyst is operating in ATR-mode as opposed to SR mode as previously discussed. According to the authors the sulphur deactivation does not appear to be linear, which would be expected from a moving deactivation zone. In the paper it is also discussed whether the increased carbon formation is due to increased surface acidity due to the sulphur present and/or if the sulphur blocks carbide oxidation sites. The sulphur resistance of catalysts with the formulation Ni/M/MgO/Al2O3 was investigated by Moon et al. [35,139]. The catalyst containing Fe in the M position proved to be better than the commercial catalyst compared with, at least at the chosen operating conditions and time-on-stream (25 h). The catalyst showed a better sulphur resistance at 100 ppm sulphur content in iso-octane, but was not completely resistant. Nickel was also used by Wang et al., supported on alumina and promoted with W and Ce for improved sulphur resistance [140]. The presence of W in the nickel-phase improved the sulphur resistance for the ATR of gasoline; however none of the prepared catalysts were able to reform gasoline with a sulphur content of 3.8 ppm for more than 20 h. The same research group also investigated the use of ZSM-5 supported Ni [141], similar to the work described previously on SR [37]. Again, the addition of Re increased the sulphur tolerance, but the catalyst was still permanently deactivated by the sulphur. In a recent paper by Lee, rare-earth metal ion-exchanged zeolites (Y-type) were used as support but for Rh and used in the ATR of jet fuel [142]. When using a zeolite ion-exchanged with Sm, the resulting catalyst was able to reform JP8 with 1096 ppmw sulphur over a 20 h time period. Rh was also used by Ferrandon et al. in the ATR of gasoline but supported on La-Al2O3 [143]. The authors concluded that at 800 °C the catalyst could be fully recovered by switching from a gasoline containing 34 ppm sulphur to a sulphur-free gasoline, the corresponding value at 700 °C was 50%. The presence of sulphur increased the sintering of the Rh, probably due to a decrease in SR activity. Other commercial catalysts has been investigated [144], with unknown composition, for the ATR of various hydrocarbons in the boiling range from 190 to 325 °C and at space velocities from 13 000 to 18 000 h−1. No catalyst deactivation was observed with time-on-stream; however the addition of 11 and 30 ppmw 1-benzothiophene to the hydrocarbon feedstock decreased the conversion due to catalyst deactivation. The deactivation was partly reversible and some activity was regained with a switch from a sulphur-rich to a sulphur-free feedstock. In another paper, Klinghoffer et al. investigated the durability and sulphur-effects of a commercial Pt/Rh-based BASF catalyst for the ATR of JP8 [145]. The authors ruled out start-up and shutdown cycles as a reason for catalyst deactivation. Sulphur (125 ppm in feed) on the other hand had a detrimental effect on fuel conversion for the first 250 h of operation. After the initial 250 h of operation the conversion levelled out at about 66% conversion for the reminder of the 370 h test. A couple of patents in the field have been identified [146–151]."
3,Water-gas shift,"2.2 Water-gas shift As mentioned earlier, the industrial production of hydrogen is most commonly based on a two-step WGS process with the heat-of-reaction removed in-between and after the reaction steps. The two catalysts, Fe–Cr and Cu–Zn, do however behave differently in contact with sulphur. The Cu-Zn is permanently damaged by the presence of sulphur and will have to be replaced if exposed to sulphur; the Fe–Cr catalyst on the other hand will change into the sulphide form, which is active for the WGS but not as active as the oxide form [152–155]. Another alternative, if there are high concentrations of sulphur in the gas, is to use sulphide-based catalysts which are normally Mo or Co-based or mixtures thereof. Newsome reviewed the research with respect to the WGS up to 1980 [156] and Ratnasamy and Wagner published another review in 2009 [157] where much information may be mined. The use of sulphide-based catalyst will require a minimum of 300 ppm of sulphur in the gas entering the reactor, however if the catalysts are properly pre-sulphided as low values as 35 ppm has been reported [157]. A concentration of 300 ppm in the gas-phase is equivalent to at least 600 to 1000 ppm in the liquid-phase given the use of steam or air as oxidant, the difficulty in maintaining the catalyst properly sulphided and the relatively low space velocities practically allowed (2000–3000 h−1) makes the use of sulphide-based catalysts less likely in the small-scale production of hydrogen; more information on the topic may be found here [156–167]. An alternative sulphur-tolerant high-temperature shift catalyst is based on cobalt chromium oxide and has demonstrated unchanged activity at as high sulphur levels as 220–240 ppm and 650 h on-stream [168,169]. The ratio of Co-to-Cr was identified as important not only for activity but also for the catalyst stability, with a ratio of 3-to-1 giving a relatively high activity, low methanation and stable catalyst. The sulphur present did not accelerate deactivation over a 450 h period. Another interesting recent development is the use of lanthanide oxy-sulphide catalysts for the high-temperature WGS reaction [170]. Valsamakis et al. used La and Pr oxy-sulphides and investigated the reaction at rather high space velocities, such as 14 000 h−1. The reaction lit off at about 400 °C and reach equilibrium at about 750 °C. The major advantage of the catalyst is that no sulphur is lost during operation and that it can be operated with high levels of sulphur present, the major drawback is its low activity which is five times lower than commercial Fe–Cr-based catalysts. With respect to small-scale hydrogen generation in general and for systems requiring fast response-times such as on-board reformers in particular, the traditional WGS catalysts are not active enough [32]. Indeed, with the slow kinetics of the traditional catalysts the high and low-temperature shift will occupy approximately 75% of the total fuel processor volume and the pyrophoric nature of the Cu-based catalyst makes it unpractical for small-scale use. Research activities have in recent years accelerated within the field of noble-metal WGS catalysts [34]. The reactions is kinetically limited when using noble metals, even at higher temperatures [171] and the kinetics of Pt show a zero order reaction rate with respect to CO, which in contrast to Cu-based catalysts (1st order) makes the reaction rate independent of the CO concentration [172,173]. Albeit their higher activity, the light-off is at higher temperature and the WGS reaction with noble metal is practically limited at about 250 °C, giving a theoretical exit-composition of CO after the reaction of about 0.5–1% [153]. Even though there are a lot of publications on precious metals (such as Pt, Rh, Ru, Au, and Pd) supported on easily and partially reducible supports (such as ceria, zirconia, titania, iron oxides, and mixed oxides of ceria, like ceria- zirconia), please review [32,157] for an overview, there are surprisingly few dealing with the sulphur-effects of this type of catalysts. The sulphur resistance of one high-temperature (Pt–Re-based) and one low-temperature (Pt-based) shift catalysts were reported by Farrauto et al. [32]. Both catalysts performed well under sulphur-free conditions at space velocities in the 16 000 to 32 000 h−1 during. However, when adding sulphur to the gas at low concentrations (0.1–5 ppm) the Pt–Re-based catalyst is irreversibly deactivated quite quickly. The results from testing with the Pt-only catalyst show that sulphur has an adverse effect on the activity proportional to the sulphur content in the gas, but that this effect is fully reversible when removing the gas. Similar results were attained by Hulteberg [20] in testing Pt-based catalysts supported on ceria. Xue et al. [174,175] investigated the sulphur influence on the WGS activity of Pt-zirconia catalyst at different H2S concentrations and 300 °C. The reported conversion went from 44% (0 ppm H2S) to 25% (50 ppm H2S) to 14% (200 ppm H2S) to 12% (1000 ppm H2S) and back to the original 44% after removal of the sulphur in the feed. The same treatment was performed on both Cu–Zn, Co–Cr and Fe–Cr catalysts; with the two first catalysts being permanently deactivated by the treatment and the Fe–Cr permanently deactivated at 300 °C but reversibly poisoned at 350 °C. The authors also showed that the zirconia did not have any sulphur uptake above 300 °C and that the addition of Cl− had a positive and K+ a negative influence on sulphur tolerance. Liu et al. followed up the study of Xue et al. by investigating the sulphur-effects on Pt/ceria catalyst under longer time periods (300 h) and more operating conditions [176]. The authors argue that the low stability of PtS may influence the sulphur tolerance positively and both research groups are unable to identify surface sulphur species [174,175]. In Luo and Gorte’s study of the effects of SO2 on the WGS activity of Pd/Ceria catalysts they concluded that perhaps the formation of Ce2O2S that may block the redox cycle could be the reason for catalyst deactivation in the presence of sulphur [177]. However, the formation of Ce2O2S was not confirmed by Xue et al., instead the physical blockage by sulphur as evidenced by BET and chemisorption was argued to be the reason for catalyst deactivation. Interesting to note is that when Mo2C was used as a carrier for Pt, the catalyst showed a permanent deactivation already at 5 ppm H2S in the gas [178]. Some patents may also be noted [179–187]."
4,CO clean-up,"2.3 CO clean-up As mentioned earlier there are two different types of CO clean-up used, METH and PROX. Both methods can be used either when a CO-free reformate is to be produced or when e.g. a PSA-system is operating at very high recoveries, leaving CO in the hydrogen which is subsequently removed before reaching any fuel cell system (the PSA system will however remove any sulphur in the feed prior to this clean-up step). As shown in Fig. 3, there is an effect of the level of sulphur in the gas with respect to the composition of the catalytic phase. There is however also a temperature effect, with can be viewed in Fig. 5 at a rather high sulphur concentration. As can be viewed in the figure, all metals show the same general behaviour, only at different points along the x-axis. As can be seen again, the base metals are more strongly influenced by sulphur (the temperature effect is however not as strong) and the noble metals show a more resistant behaviour, with Pd being the least influenced metal. There are however other important aspects to consider, such as how well the metal adsorb the reaction species (CO, H2, O2), as well as turnover frequency and selectivity. With respect to the development of METH catalysts, most of the development has been performed with respect to producing substitute natural gas from coal or biomass and in that respect both CO and CO2 is the target for conversion. In a study from 1981 [188], Trimm and Karal performed a combined theoretical and experimental study, resulting in the screening of 120 catalysts where some had better catalytic effects than the reference catalyst used. With respect to sulphur, nickel tungstate and chromate both with and without Rh and Pt doping showed improved sulphur tolerance. Also in this aspect, Ni-based catalysts are useful and has been subject to much testing with respect to sulphur-laden operation [189–197] along with Ru [189,198–201] and Co or Mo based [189,190,202–204]. Agrawal et al. [189] showed that Ni was more resistant to sulphur in a group of alumina-supported Ni, Co, Fe and Ru catalysts. The catalysts were however strongly influenced by ppb level of sulphur in the CO hydrogenation to methane, indeed 13 pbb of sulphur in the feed lowered the methanation activity about 1000 fold at 388 °C. Bartholomew et al. proved that a Ni-catalyst doped with Mo was more sulphur resistant than the Ni catalyst alone in feed containing 10 ppm sulphur. Bartholomew and Uken also showed a similar behaviour for nickel boride and Raney-nickel catalysts [191]. A multi-component and sulphur resistant catalyst was manufactured ant tested by Shufen et al. [194] which continued to produce methane at about 56% selectivity over 1000 h. The catalyst was a mixture of Mo, Ni, V, Al, Cr, Co and Zr. With respect to sulphur deactivation, Kamble et al. showed that a single S-atom may deactivate from 3 to 10 metal sites in Ru catalysts, even at low surface coverage [198]. Bakar et al. showed that a mixed catalyst of Pr, Co and Ni supported on alumina showed good activity at 300 °C with 5% sulphur in the gas [203]. These publications, giving valuable insight into the sulphur effect on METH catalysts are not performed with the purpose of low concentration CO clean-up in front of a fuel cell system. Indeed, there are very few studies in this topic [205–213] and none of them deal with the effects of sulphur. They do however conclude that the activity of traditional methanation catalysts in the desired temperature region is not active enough and that alternative catalysts are preferred [205]. However an overview of the catalysts used show that Ni [205,207,209] is used on different carriers, promoted with e.g. Rh, La2O3, Ru [207] and La, Fe [209]. The other papers [208,210–212] use Ru-based catalysts and neither Ru nor Ni is very good at handling sulphur contaminants at these temperatures [189]. The PROX was first developed for removing traces of CO detrimental to ammonia catalysts [2]. The development has in the latest years been driven by the low-temperature fuel cells. A very recent review has been published by Mishra and Prasad on the topic, containing much relevant information [213]. As expected, there are not much published on the sulphur effects on preferential oxidation catalysts. However, Wakita et al. have in two publications investigated the effects of sulphur on Ru and Pt catalysts supported on alumina [214,215]. The authors found the activity of the sulphur-deactivated Ru catalyst to decrease with increasing sulphur concentration, albeit with a constant CO selectivity. The Pt catalyst behaved differently, with a constant activity and a loss in selectivity with increasing sulphur concentrations; during regeneration, both catalysts showed formation of Al2(SO4)3 in the carrier phase. Similarly in a second publication, the authors found that a Ru on alumina catalyst showed increasing selectivity for CO in the presence of sulphur, suggested to be due to a hindering of dissociative migration of adsorbed H atoms on the Ru. No patents of interest have been identified relating to sulphur operation from a CO methanation or preferential oxidation fuel cell clean-up point-of-view."
5,Conclusions,"In designing small-scale hydrogen production units, stable catalyst performance under sulphur-laden conditions is of interest from a number of perspectives. With catalysts that handle this type of contaminants, more design alternatives becomes available which may improve such parameters as efficiency, feedstock choice and investment cost ultimately resulting in lower hydrogen cost-of-production. With the background of the performed literature review, the following recommendations can be made with respect to the catalyst material choice. The SR of sulphur-rich streams seems to be more suitably performed using noble metal catalysts, with the exception of Ru. Indeed some Rh catalysts are known to show a higher activity with sulphur present that without sulphur. The preferred support seems to be ceria, zirconia or mixed oxides thereof, with doping of e.g. Gd. The use of Ni-based catalysts seems less likely to succeed. In the case of POX for sulphur-containing hydrocarbon streams, supported Rh or mixed Pt/Rh seems to be a good alternative. But also the use of hexaaluminate or pyrochlore-type minerals with Rh or Ni incorporated into the lattice structure seems to be a viable alternative. In the ATR, the use of perovskites with potassium or rhodium seems to be stable in the presence of sulphur and also ceria, zirconia mixed oxides doped with Gd holds promise for stable sulphur-rich operation. With these types of catalysts, it is believed that it should be possible to design systems operating on liquid feedstocks containing low to medium levels of sulphur. The use of a pre-reforming step is probably advisable but from a coking perspective that is. The WGS catalysts based on Pt and supported on ceria and ceria/zirconia mixed oxides show a lowering in activity with the presence of sulphur. However, the activity is stabilised at a lower level and can be fully regenerated when the source of sulphur is removed. There thus seems to be good chance of operating a WGS reactor in the presence of sulphur albeit the larger reactor volume required for the reaction has to be valued against a pre-WGS sulphur removal. The METH catalysts currently in use today, Ni and Ru-based, does not hold promise for sulphur-rich operation and is therefore identified as a field in need of future work, should the need arise in the industry for such a catalyst. Also in the PROX, there seems to be more work required in the field of sulphur effects, however as the sulphur-effects become more significant the lower the temperature finding a viable solution might be difficult and up-stream sulphur removal may be preferred. With the conclusions drawn from the literature reviewed it in turn leads to believe that on a system level, it may be possible to use a sulphur-laden fuel at least in the first (SR, ATR or POX) reaction step and also in the WGS reaction step. There also seem to be a reasonable possibility to operate a system on a sulphur-containing liquid hydrocarbon, assuming that issues with gasification and pre-reforming is sorted, with the catalysts described above for the first reaction step. From a systems cost perspective, it is reasonable to make a trade-off study with respect to improved operating performance and the size of the WGS reactor from an investment and operational cost perspective. It is however, from a systems design perspective, advisable to remove any sulphur before performing a low-temperature gas-polishing reaction step such as PROX or METH."
