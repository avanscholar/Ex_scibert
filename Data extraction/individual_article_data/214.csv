0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered one of the most promising alternative energy sources and it has about three times the calorific value of gasoline and natural gas [1]. Hydrogen energy is gradually being incorporated into the energy strategy system of the world. Hydrogen is mainly produced from natural gas and coal in industry. However, these technologies require additional heating to higher operating temperatures, which will result in additional waste of resources during the production of hydrogen. The plasma technology can improve energy utilization efficiency, chemical selectivity and promote the progress of the chemical reaction [2–6]. This application is particularly suitable for hydrogen production from liquid hydrocarbon fuel, especially for in-situ hydrogen production, including ethanol [7–15], methanol [16,17], methane [18–20], n-dodecane [21], and liquid hydrocarbons (the C7-C16 series) [22]. Among them, ethanol can be obtained through the fermentation of waste materials containing lignocellulose in agriculture and industry, such as crop straw and sawdust. As natural resources are gradually depleted and hydrogen energy concept are development, more and more research focused on hydrogen production methods using clean fuels [23–28]. Ethanol has grown up to be a promising alternative fuel for hydrogen production because of its high hydrogen content, low toxicity, renewable, convenient storage and safety. Therefore, plasma decomposition of ethanol to produce hydrogen is considered to be a promising hydrogen production method in in-situ hydrogen production technology. Currently, the method of plasma generation has mainly divided into discharge in gas-phase [2–19] and liquid-phase [20,24–28]. Among them, microwave discharge can generate abundant high-energy electrons and active radicals, which also generate higher plasma density and larger spatial distribution [29]. At the same time, the microwave discharge in liquid does not require carrier gas, and the electrode can be directly in contact with the dense liquid. Another advantage of microwave discharge in liquid is that it can prevent equipment malfunctioning due to carbon deposits. In our previous studies, Sun B et al. [26] investigated hydrogen produced by microwave discharge in ethanol liquid, achieved a high flow rate of hydrogen and the energy yield of hydrogen production about 13,530 N mL/min and 48.32 Ng/kWh, respectively. Accordingly, the research on hydrogen production by liquid-phase discharge plasma has gradually attracted attention [30–33]. The mechanism research on hydrogen production by discharge plasma is beneficial to guide the increase of hydrogen production. In order to increase the selectivity to the desired product hydrogen, it is indispensable to study the mechanism of hydrogen production by plasma. Mechanism research mainly focuses on gas-phase discharge. Wang et al. [34] has used density functional theory (DFT) to study the reaction path of hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming under cold plasma. The results showed that formaldehyde and methane were the preferred products of ethanol molecular decomposition. And the formation of H2 and CO mainly depends on the decomposition of CH2O and ·HCO. Tsyganov D et al. [3] studied the decomposition of ethanol to hydrogen by tornado-type microwave plasma. A theoretical model was developed for elucidating the decomposition of ethanol to describe plasma thermodynamics, gas heating, and flow, as well as chemical kinetics. The results showed that the decomposition of ethanol proceeds through two parallel channels with equal probability. The formation of H2 and CO depends on the CH2OH radical conversion and hydrocarbons dehydrogenation, and water vapor was beneficial to improve the hydrogen production efficiency of ethanol. Highly reactive radical such as OH, H and O will be produced when water participates in the plasma reforming reaction, thereby promoting the efficiency of plasma reforming alcohol to produce hydrogen. But, mechanism research of hydrogen production with discharge plasma in liquid becomes more complicated, because of the participation of water in the discharge process. Zhao et al. [32] investigated that the pathways of hydrogen-rich gas produced by microwave discharge in ethanol-water mixtures. The results showed that water molecules can create additional OH and H radicals, and there were significantly positive linear relationships between H or CH2 and H2. However, there was no detailed description about other by-products. In previous studies, there are few reports on the mechanism of hydrogen production by discharging in liquid, especially for the analysis of liquid products. In this study, the mechanism of ethanol decomposition for producing large capacity hydrogen was investigated by microwave discharge in liquid. The gas-phase and liquid-phase products and active substances were analyzed, especially, the change of liquid products under different discharge conditions was analyzed. In order to better understand the influence of water on the plasma decomposition of ethanol process and the production of gas and liquid chemicals, the possible reaction mechanisms and pathways were discussed. This study provides a reference for the optimization of plasma decomposition of alcohol to produce hydrogen, and also provides a basis for future work which for fuel purification in the online hydrogen production process."
1,Experimental setup and methods,"The experimental setup of microwave discharge in liquid is shown in Fig. 1 . It consists of waveguide system, microwave plasma generation system, feedstock material supply system, cooling system, and gas-liquid analysis system. The reactor was composed of quartz tubes, and the thin end of the quartz tube was inserted vertically into the resonant cavity of the waveguide. A generator provides the microwaves at 2.45 GHz and maximum power of 2.0 kW. The microwaves propagate through a standard R26 (WR340) rectangular waveguide system with the length and width of the cross-section of 86.36 mm and 43.18 mm respectively, which consisted of a water-cooled circulator, directional couplers, a three-stub tuner, and a moveable plunger. Before the experiment, the dry vacuum pump was turned on to reduce the internal pressure of the reactor and the raw material tank to 10kpa. After the pressure stabilizes, turn on the microwave generator. The microwaves were optimally coupled with the tungsten electrode in the reactor, and plasma was generated in the liquid at the tip of the electrode. The ethanol solution was continuously injected from the ethanol tank into the reactor by the submersible pump to maintain plasma generation. The gas produced in the reactor was recovered from another pipeline by the dry vacuum pump. Related research on the morphology of the plasma was described in previous study [23]. When the plasma was stable, the moveable plunger and the three-stub tuner were fine-tuned to reduce the reflected power to less than 5% of the incident power. The gas produced by the decomposition of ethanol solution was cooled using the cold trap at 0℃. The discharge time of each experiment was 20 min. Then, the flow rate of total gas was measured with the rotor flow meter. In the experiments, the percentage concentrations of gas can be calculated through the volume of gas. The filtered solution was collected and analyzed after prescribing discharge time of each experiment. A gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014C) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze the produced gases. High-purity argon (99.999 %) was used as the carrier gas for the quantitative determination of the gaseous products, the argon flow rate was 40 mL/min. The produced gases were identified and quantitative by comparison with standard curves of authenticated gases. A Shimadzu GC-2010 equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyze the filtered solution. High-purity nitrogen (99.999 %) was used as the carrier gas, the nitrogen flow rate was 1.4 mL/min. In this work, each set of experimental data was repeated five times. The errors were mainly caused by the instantaneous instability of discharge, the changing external environment and the numerical reading. A spectrometer (PMA-11, Hamamatsu Photonics) was used to measure the optical emission spectrometry of the plasma radiation. Every experimental spectrum was set to an automatic average of 50 spectra and the exposure time was set to 30 ms."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Characteristics of active species,"3.1 Characteristics of active species A lot of free radicals were generated during the microwave discharge, and these active species played an important role in the hydrogen production process. Analyzing the changes of free radicals is beneficial to understand the reaction path of water molecules involved in the decomposition of ethanol. In this section, optical emission spectrometry (OES) was used to analyze the changes of free radicals during the microwave discharge process. The microwave power was controlled at 700 W, and the changes of free radicals during the discharge of the ethanol volume fractions of 20 % and 99.7 % were assessed (Fig. 2 ). It was found that the primary active species generated by the discharge were ·OH, ·CH, C2, and ·H. These results indicated that the ethanol molecules and water molecules were effectively decomposed. As shown in Fig. 2, the rise of the emission spectral baseline was caused by the thermal radiation of the reactor. The relative intensity of the C2, CH, H radicals significantly increased as the volume fraction of the ethanol increased, while the relative intensity of OH radical decreased. That might due to the C2, CH, H radicals derived from the decomposition of ethanol molecules. The OH radicals decreased mainly caused by the change of water molecule content in the solution, and the OH radicals were derived from the decomposition of the water molecules. (R1) H2O + e* → OH + H + e The relative intensity of these radicals was related to the volume fraction of ethanol. C2 was derived from the decomposition of ethanol molecules and was positively correlated with ethanol concentration. The rotational temperature of C2 radicals is 3500 K–4400 K. After microwave discharge for 10 min, the color of the ethanol solution changes with the increase of the ethanol volume fraction. It was found that the ethanol solution turned into black with visible solid carbon when the ethanol volume fraction was 99.7 %, and the ethanol solution was colorless and transparent when the ethanol volume fraction was 20 %. It can be seen from the emission spectrum, when water molecules do not participate in the ethanol decomposition reaction, the relative intensity of C2 radicals increased significantly, while a large number of carbon black particles appear in the solution. But, the participation of water molecules, the relative of OH radicals increased significantly, C2 radicals decreased and the carbon black particles disappear. Therefore, there was significantly relationship between solid carbon, C2 radicals and OH radicals."
4,Analysis of gaseous products,"3.2 Analysis of gaseous products 3.2.1 Effect of ethanol volume fraction on gaseous products This microwave power was controlled at 900 W, and the effect of ethanol volume fraction on gaseous products was studied by gas chromatography as shown in Fig. 3 . The experiment confirmed that the gaseous products were H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. About 79 %–87 % of the gaseous products were mainly H2 and CO and the H2/CO ratio was about 1.98−2.24. According to the H2/CO ratio shown by the experimental results, the plasma decomposition of ethanol to produce hydrogen is described by the following global reaction mechanism: (R2) C2H5OH + H2O → 2CO + 4H2 (R3) C2H5OH → CO + 3H2 + C The experimental results show that the H2/CO ratio was 2.24 instead of 3, when the ethanol volume fraction was 99.7 %. It may be caused by the production of a large number of by-products during the plasma decomposition of ethanol. In addition, the percentage concentrations of CH4, CO2, C2H2, and C2H4 in the gas phase were 4.67 %–5.29 %, 0 %–1.19 %, 4.17 %–11.71 %, and 4.29 %–5.01 %, respectively. A small percentage amount of C2H6 was between 0.10 % and 0.29 %. Among them, the concentration of the total gas by-products was highest at 20.7 %, when pure ethanol was decomposed by plasma. As the volume fraction of ethanol increased, the percentages concentration of H2, CO, and CO2 decreased and the percentages of CH4, C2H4, C2H2 showed an increasing trend, especially the concentration of C2H2 was significantly increased. The concentration of C2H2 showed the highest, and CO indicated lowest concentration when the ethanol volume fraction was 99.7 %, and a large number of carbon black particles appear in the solution. The emission spectrum shows that the OH radicals spectral intensity disappears, and the C2 radicals were the highest intensity. It was considered that in the process of microwave discharge, the OH radicals were produced by the decomposition of water and consume C radicals in the solution to produce CO. Therefore, the amount of CO was decreased as the volume fraction of ethanol increases. In addition, the change in the percentage of C2H2 might be related to the C2 radicals. The increase of C2 radicals content was due to the disappearance of OH radicals and ethanol molecules increased. The CO2 and H2 concentration were highest when the ethanol volume fraction was 20 %, and the CO2 concentration gradually disappears as the ethanol volume fraction increases. This may be the water-gas shift reaction: (R4) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 The water-gas shift reaction was beneficial to improve hydrogen selectivity. The content of OH radicals produced by water decomposition in the reaction system affects the formation of solid carbon and the increase of acetylene content. Therefore, the OH radicals produced by the decomposition of water molecules play an important role in the ethanol decomposition pathways. 3.2.2 Effect of microwave power on gaseous products Microwave power is an important factor for maintaining and affecting plasma discharge. The increase of microwave power will change the energy input of the system, and affect the physical properties, such as the state and intensity of discharge plasma. Therefore, it was considered that the microwave power might affect the plasma chemical reactions. Fig. 4 show the effects of microwave power on gaseous products using microwave liquid-phase discharge. The volume fraction of ethanol solution was 40 %. As the microwave power increased, the percentage concentration of H2 and CO2 increased. Conversely, the C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 showed decreased trends. It was due to the energy and density of the high-energy electrons increased with the increasing of microwave power, which led to the stronger collision between the ethanol and high-energy electrons, further accelerating molecular decomposition. The increase in the amount of CO2 was due to the intensified water-gas shift reaction. However, the percentage of CH4 showed no significant change as the microwave power increases. In order to explore the change of gaseous products with microwave power under different ethanol volume fractions, the linear slope of the curve of each gaseous concentration percentage with microwave power under different ethanol volume fractions was shown in Fig. 5 . The linear slope represents the change trend of the gaseous products with microwave power. When the ethanol volume fraction was 20 %, the linear slope of C2H2 was -1.0. This indicated that the concentration of C2H2 showed significantly decreased with the increase of microwave power. However, when the ethanol volume fraction was 99.7 %, the linear slope of C2H2 was 0.12. Indicating the concentration of C2H2 showed increased slowly with the increase of microwave power. That may because the C2H2 production paths were mainly derived from free radical reorganization such as Eqs. (26)–(29) [32]: (26) CH2 + CH2 → C2H2 + H2 (27) CH2 + H → CH + H2 (28) CH + CH2 → C2H2 + H (29) CH + H → C + H2 C2H2 was produced by the recombination of free radicals. As the microwave power increased, the dehydrogenation reaction of free radicals was accelerated, the concentration of C2H2 gradually decreased. However, under anhydrous conditions, the increase of C radicals inhibit the dehydrogenation reaction of CH and CH2, resulting in an increase of CH and CH2 radicals, eventually the concentration of C2H2 increases. Therefore, as the volume fraction of ethanol increases, the linear slope of C2H2 rises significantly. The linear slope of CH4 and C2H6 concentration percentage with microwave power change in different ethanol volume fraction were invariably close to 0. The results showed that during the discharge the CH4 and C2H6 concentrations were little affected by microwave power. That may because the percentage concentration of C2H6 was only about 0.1 %, caused the linear slope does not change significantly. According to analysis, the decomposition reaction of ethanol starts from the process of ethanol molecules being broken by high-energy electrons to form free radicals, and the free radicals interact. Table 1 shows the possible pathways of ethanol decomposition by the high-energy electrons [34]. It can be seen that Eqs. (1) and (2) requires the lower activation energy (59.82 and 72.84 kcal/mol) than the decomposition energy of others Eqs. (3)–(6), which was conducive to the preferential progress of the reaction. The gaseous product of CH4 was produced by the direct decomposition of ethanol solution. Moreover, CH4 can also be formed by Eq. (31) ( CH3 + H → CH4). However, as shown in Fig. 5, when the microwave discharge was stable, the microwave power does not affect the change of CH4. Therefore, it is considered that CH4 mainly derived from Eq. (1). CH4 was a product of a balance between formation and consumption. This may be the reason that the CH4 had no significantly changed as the microwave power increased."
5,Analysis of liquid products,"3.3 Analysis of liquid products During the microwave discharge, ethanol molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons to form macromolecular substances first, which were further decomposed by high-energy electrons or active substances to form small molecules. The microwave power was controlled at 900 W, the ethanol volume fraction was 40 %. A gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyze the filtered solution. By comparison with standard chemicals, the concentrations of CH3CHO and CH3OH in the solution were measured after microwave discharge. In order to have better understand the effect of discharge time on the formation of liquid products, the changes in the concentration of liquid products under different discharge time were detected. Start timing after the discharge was stable, the discharge time interval is set to 3 min. The effect of discharge time on liquid products was studied shown in Fig. 6 . As the discharge time increases, the content of CH3CHO significantly increased in the solution. Conversely, the CH3OH concentration increased inconspicuous. This indicated that the production rate of CH3CHO was greater than CH3OH. According to reaction 2, the CH3CHO was the product of the collision between ethanol molecules and high-energy electrons. In addition, the CH3CHO showed less concentration in solution, it is considered that the CH3OH molecules were produced by the reorganization of the CH3 and OH. Acetaldehyde and methanol molecules were accumulated in the solution, at the same time, they were also decomposed under the continuous action of electrons and free radicals to generate hydrogen. The reaction formula is shown in Table 2 . During the microwave discharge, the liquid products were decomposed by the plasma while being generated. CH3CHO and CH3OH interact with OH, H and O radicals to generate H2, CO and other gases. Microwave power was controlled at 900 W, the discharge time was 12 min and the effect of ethanol volume fraction on the concentration of liquid products and the flow rate of hydrogen was shown in Fig. 7 . As the volume fraction of ethanol increased, the concentrations of liquid products CH3CHO and CH3OH also increased, which further leads to an increased in the flow of hydrogen. It was found that the microwave power was controlled at 900 W, the highest concentration of CH3CHO and CH3OH occurs when the volume fraction of ethanol was 80 %, and the flow rate of hydrogen was also the highest at 7.49 NL/min, the energy yield of hydrogen production about 0.5 Nm3/kWh. Of course, increasing the microwave power is conducive to the generation of hydrogen. Previous studies [25] have demonstrated that when the microwave power was 1500 W, the maximum flow rate of total gas is 23.25 N L/min, the flow rate of hydrogen is 13.53 NL/min. When the ethanol volume fraction exceeds 80 %, the concentration of liquid products CH3CHO and CH3OH showed a downward trend, as does the flow rate of hydrogen. It was found that the concentration of CH3CHO and the flow rate of hydrogen have a high degree of consistency under different ethanol volume fractions. Therefore, these evidences showed that Eq. (2) was the main pathway of ethanol decomposition by the high-energy electrons."
6,Reaction path analysis,"Based on the above analysis, the possible reaction path of microwave discharge in ethanol solution was deduced as shown in Fig. 8 . First, ethanol molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons to generate CH4 and CH2O. At the same time, water molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons to generate OH and H radicals. CH2O interacts with OH and H radicals to generate H2 and CO. Besides, ethanol molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons to form CH3CHO and H2. CH3CHO molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons and react with OH and H radicals to produce H2, CO, and CH3 radicals. A part of CH3 radicals react with OH radicals to produce methanol, and another part of CH3 radicals reacts under the action of high-energy electrons and H, OH radicals to generate H2 and CH2, CH radicals. These free radicals recombine with each other and eventually produce C2H2, C2H4, C2H6."
7,Conclusion,"In this study, the reaction pathways of microwave discharge decomposition of ethanol solution to produce hydrogen were studied by comparing the intensity of the emission spectrum and the features in the concentration of gas-phase and liquid-phase products. Experiments have identified the following gas-phase products included H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, and the liquid-phase products primarily included CH3CHO and CH3OH. The ethanol solution was decomposed by microwave plasma mainly into two pathways. The ethanol molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons, mainly to generated CH3CHO and H2, at the same time, also generated CH4 and CH2O. During microwave discharge, H2O molecules were decomposed by high-energy electrons to generate OH and H radicals. This radical was beneficial to the generation of hydrogen and also inhibits the formation of solid carbon and gaseous by-products."
