0,Introduction,"Recovery of renewable and clean energy from sustainable feedstocks has drawn considerable interest to balance the resource exploitation and carbon neutral (Ahmad et al., 2016). As a sustainable and renewable technology for H2 production, biohydrogen production integrates bioenergy recovery with waste treatment (such as treatment of wastewater from various sources, sludge, food residues, and straw), in which microorganisms degrade simple or complex organics in solid wastes or wastewater to produce H2 and other byproducts through different metabolic pathways (Kothari et al., 2014; Li et al., 2019c) (Fig. 1 ). Hydrogen-producing microorganisms are one of the most important contributors to biohydrogen production and widely occur in a variety of natural environments (Xing et al., 2008a). These microorganisms produce H2 from protons and electrons through enzymatic catalysis, and can be classified into two categories based on whether light is involved in this process: (1) blue-green algae and photosynthetic bacteria, such as Cyanobacteria, Synechocystis, Chlamydomonas, Rhodopsuedomonas, and Rhodobacter (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Benemann, 2000; Kim and Kim, 2011; Liu et al., 2015a), and (2) dark fermentative bacteria, such as Clostridium, Ethanoligenens, Enterobacter, Paenibaciulls, Bacillus, Bacteroides, Citrobacter, and Thermotoga (Burow et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2018; Xing et al., 2006). The latter group can produce H2, volatile fatty acids, and alcohols from complex organic waste streams with a higher hydrogen-producing rate and a lower energy requirement, compared with photosynthetic prokaryotes, making them a more attractive candidate for continuous and large-scaled H2 production (Boyd et al., 2010; Prakash et al., 2018; Wrighton et al., 2014). Biohydrogen production by mixed cultures of fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) can be categorized into three main fermentation types, each with their own specific functional populations and metabolic products: butyric acid-type, mixed acid-type, and ethanol-type (Ren et al., 2007b; Xing et al., 2008a). Formation of the fermentation type depends on the identity of the dominant populations enriched in anaerobic hydrogen-producing reactors, which, in turn, is affected by operating conditions, such as pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and hydraulic retention time (HRT) (Ren et al., 1997; Shi et al., 2019). Several studies have indicated that a relatively high pH (>5.5) facilitates the establishment of butyric acid-type and mixed acid-type fermentations, while lower pH (4.0–4.5) promotes the formation of ethanol-type fermentation (ETF) (i.e., ethanol-acetate fermentation of mixed culture) (Ren et al., 1997; Ren et al., 2007b; Xing et al., 2008a). ETF was first discovered by Nanqi Ren in the course of studying on the anaerobic biological treatment of molasses wastewater in 1993 (Ren et al., 1997). Besides as one of the three hydrogen-producing fermentation types, ETF has also proven to be one of the three main fermentation types in acidogenesis of the anaerobic biological treatment with obvious advantages such as low pH tolerance and high efficiency of H2 production (Table 1 ) (Ren et al., 1997; Ren et al., 2007a; Ren et al., 2007b; Xing et al., 2008a). Afterward, Ethanoligenens has been isolated from a hydrogen-producing continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and identified as a new genus in ETF (Xing et al., 2006). Ethanoligenens, is a representative genus of ETF that has attracted increasing attention for its physiological and metabolic properties (Abdalla et al., 2018; Xing et al., 2006). A number of studies demonstrated that Ethanoligenens spp. were the dominant populations in anaerobic bioreactors and their relative abundance was 12.6–40.9 % (Anzola-Rojas Mdel et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2020). Community analyses suggest the diverse uncultured Ethanoligenens species occurred in the natural and engineered environment, but only one species, Ethanoligenens harbinense, so far was isolated and designated (Lin et al., 2003; Xing et al., 2006) (Fig. 2 ). Researches showed that E. harbinense could be effectively enriched with the relative abundance of 19.0–20.4 % in ethanol-type fermentative continuous-flow reactors using wastewater as substrate (Ren et al., 2007b; Zhao et al., 2018). The main end-products of Ethanoligenens are ethanol, acetic acid, H2, and CO2; all of these end-products may serve as metabolic intermediates (substrate, electron donor, or electron shuttle) to other microbial partners, such as methanogens, acetogens, iron and sulfate reducers, and denitrifiers, or may be recovered and used as feedstock for the production of high-value biochemical products and macromolecule biopolymers (Abdalla et al., 2018; Dahiya and Mohan, 2019; Ren et al., 2011; Xing et al., 2006). Compared with Clostridium, the representative genus of butyric acid-type fermentation, Ethanoligenens is acid-tolerant and has a greater potential for syntrophic interaction with methanogens because of its H2-ethanol co-production characteristics. Additionally, the special autoaggregation capacity of Ethanoligenens enables it to form biofilms or anaerobic granule aggregates that are necessary to effectively retain cell biomass during anaerobic fermentation processes (Li et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2019c; Ren et al., 2007b). Research on fermentative hydrogen production has focused on the bioreactor configuration (Anzola-Rojas Mdel et al., 2016; Mohammadi et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2011; Saleem et al., 2018), the optimization of operation parameters (Dessi et al., 2017; Fuess et al., 2019; Moreno Dávila et al., 2020), pretreatment methods for substrate utilization (Bakonyi et al., 2014; Jeong et al., 2013; Karaosmanoglu Gorgeç and Karapinar, 2019; Wang and Yin, 2017), highly efficient HPB (Liu et al., 2015a; O-Thong et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2006), and coupling processes (Liu et al., 2015b; Lu et al., 2009a). H2 production efficiency can be improved to a limited extent by optimization of operating conditions. However, since significant proportion of substrates could rapidly convert to cell biomass and other organic carbon sinks (such as acetic acid and ethanol) instead of H2 and lead to the metabolic inhibition, it is still difficult to substantially improve the energy conversion efficiency of acidogenic fermentation due to the metabolic obstacles. A comprehensive insight into metabolic regulation and syntrophic interaction between HPB and other microbes is important to redesign highly efficient cascade recovery technologies of energy and resources from wastewater or solid wastes. The systematic and in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of ethanol-H2 co-production fermentation is helpful to provide accurate regulation strategies for efficient H2 production and directed recovery of metabolites. However, only a few studies have looked in-depth at molecular regulation mechanism of hydrogen-producing metabolism and the syntrophic interaction mechanism between HPB and other microorganisms (Hallenbeck et al., 2012; Speers et al., 2014). Here, the molecular aspects of ETF are reviewed to summarize our knowledge of and the regulatory strategies for enhancing hydrogen production as well as the targeted recovery of metabolites through ethanol fermentation. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of using hydrogen production by ethanol fermentation in practice applications are discussed (Fig. 1)."
1,The genetics of fermentative HPB,
2,Hydrogenase genes of Ethanoligenens,"2.1 Hydrogenase genes of Ethanoligenens Genetic evidence indicates that almost all fermentative HPB have one or more hydrogenase proteins (Hyd) (Lee et al., 2010; Vignais and Billoud, 2007). NiFe‑hydrogenases (NiFe-H2ases) and FeFe‑hydrogenases (FeFe-H2ases) were named based on the metal cofactors in their active sites, respectively, which reversibly catalyze H2 evolution or uptake to remove excess reductant produced through fermentative metabolism (Greening and Cook, 2014; Marshall et al., 2012; Vignais et al., 2001; Vignais and Billoud, 2007). Early research on the molecular mechanism of ethanol fermentative HPB indicated that FeFe-H2ases are the key enzyme in hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens (Xing et al., 2008a; Zhao et al., 2010). FeFe-H2ases achieve higher hydrogen production rates and are more prevalent in fermentative metabolism compared with the more commonly utilized NiFe-H2ase (Marshall et al., 2012; Wrighton et al., 2014). The large subunit of the FeFe-H2ase (HydA) of Ethanoligenens was first isolated in 2006 and has been used to develop a new method based on specific degenerate primers to detect the quantity and activity of Ethanoligenens cells (Xing et al., 2008a). The hydA gene of Ethanoligenens harbinense was later cloned, sequenced, and heterologously over-expressed in Escherichia coli, which demonstrated the ability of the FeFe-H2ases to efficiently produce H2. Follow-up studies have shown that the genes encoding enzymes involved in the ethanol-H2 co-metabolic pathway of E. harbinense, such as FeFe-H2ases, alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), and acetate kinase (Ack), were up-regulated by the exogenous addition of Mg2+, Fe2+, and L-cysteine (Zhao et al., 2017b; Zhao et al., 2019). Recently, the complete genome and methylome of E. harbinense were constructed using PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. Comparative genomics analysis with other known HPB has shown that Ethanoligenens has unique genetic features and low genetic similarity to Clostridium (Fig. 3a) (Li et al., 2019c). The whole genome has also revealed that E. harbinense has two dimeric FeFe-H2ase encoding genes (hyd), two monomeric FeFe-H2ase encoding genes (Figs. 3b and 4 ), and a series of genes encoding ferredoxins, Adh and Ack, which are involved in the ethanol-H2 co-metabolic pathway."
3,Other genes involved in H2 production in Ethanoligenens,"2.2 Other genes involved in H2 production in Ethanoligenens Several genes participate in the biosynthesis of FeFe-H2ases, including structural genes, regulatory genes, and auxiliary genes for non-protein ligand insertion and hydrogenase maturation (Vignais et al., 2001). In E. harbinense, the structural FeFe-H2ase genes (hyd1-hyd4) encode proteins that form the main body of the hydrogenase and serve as key enzymes for H2 evolution, while the hydE, hydF, and hydG genes encode for FeFe-H2ase maturases required for H-cluster maturation (Leach and Zamble, 2007; Li et al., 2019c; Lill, 2009; Mulder et al., 2009; Mulder et al., 2010; Posewitz et al., 2004). E. harbinense has ten ferredoxin-encoding genes, including four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-encoding genes, a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-encoding gene, and two pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR)-encoding genes. The small acidic iron‑sulfur (Fe-S) proteins known as ferredoxins are widely distributed in living organisms and frequently act as essential electron transmitters in cooperation with hydrogenases in HPB (Huang et al., 2016; Peden et al., 2013). The catalytically active central H-cluster of the FeFe-H2ases is a [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin. Clostridial FeFe-H2ases contain ferredoxins as an accessory domain in addition to the H-cluster, such as [2Fe-2S] plant ferredoxin-like domain, unique [4Fe-4S]-containing fold, and 2[4Fe-4S] domain (Peden et al., 2013; Vignais et al., 2001). PFOR catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In addition, E. harbinense has at least seven Adh-encoding genes (adh) and one Ack-encoding gene (ack). These are essential enzymes involved in ethanol and acetic acid synthesis and metabolism. Based on this genomic information, the ethanol-H2 co-metabolic pathway catalyzed by PFOR and FeFe-H2ases was proposed (Fig. 5 ) (Li et al., 2019c)."
4,H2-producing metabolic pathways in other fermentative HPB,
5,Butyric acid HPB,"3.1 Butyric acid HPB Clostridium sp. with butyric acid fermentation is evolutionarily similar to Ethanoligenens and has two distinct hydrogen-producing pathways: the PFOR/FeFe-H2ase synergetic catalytic pathway, which is similar to that of Ethanoligenens, and a second pathway that includes a cytoplasmic NiFe-H2ase and NADH ferredoxin oxidoreductase (NFOR) that couple during glycolysis to catalyze hydrogen production using NADH as an electron donor (Fig. 6a and Table 2 ) (Kamalaskar et al., 2016). Research has shown that there are four FeFe-H2ase and one nitrogenase-encoding genes located on the genome of Clostridium butyricum, and high expression of HydB2 under high concentrations of an ammonium nitrogen source has played a key role in improving hydrogen production (Hamilton et al., 2018). Another study has shown that nitrogenase plays an important role in H2 production by C. butyricum (Calusinska et al., 2015). C. pasteurianum has NiFe-H2ase and FeFe-H2ase-encoding genes, which can convert glycerin into H2. The over-expression of hydA substantially improved the production of hydrogen and acetic acid in C. pasteurianum (Sarma et al., 2019). In addition, the presence of coenzyme-NFOR has been shown to play a critical role in butyric acid-H2 co-production by C. tyrobutyricum (Jiang et al., 2013). Interestingly, if the pH of the medium drops below about pH 5.0, the butyric fermentation by Clostridium will shift to the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation and produces acetone, butanol, ethanol, H2, and CO2 as major fermentation products (Fig. 6b) (Mahato et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Clostridium acetobutylicum produces 2 mol of H2 per mol of hexose in the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation. Genes encoding enzymes that produce neutral acetone and alcohols are derepressed. Genome analysis indicated that dehydrogenases involved in acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation, such as secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (sAdhE) and bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase, are important enzymes for the production of H2 and ethanol by Clostridium species (Li et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2018)."
6,Mixed-acid HPB,"3.2 Mixed-acid HPB Mixed-acid HPB have their own hydrogen-producing pathways unique from ethanol and butyric acid HPB (Fig. 6c and Table 2). In the mixed-acid fermentation by Escherichia coli, Hyd, formate dehydrogenase (FDH), and various mature proteins (such as HypA-HypF and HycE) work together to produce H2 through a pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) and PFOR co-metabolic pathway (Rai et al., 2019). The PFL of E. coli is a compound enzyme including two hydrogenases (Hyd-3 and Hyd-4) and a formate dehydrogenase H (FDH-H) containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster (Bagramyan and Trchounian, 2003). FDH-H catalyzes the oxidation of formic acid to CO2, generating two electrons and two protons simultaneously, which leads to hydrogen production through the Hyd protein (Bagramyan and Trchounian, 2003). The concentration of NADH substantially increases when the ptsG gene is knocked out of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), leading to enhanced hydrogen production in E. coli (Balderas-Hernandez et al., 2020). The H2 metabolism in Enterobacter aerogenes also takes place through two pathways—the PFL pathway and the NADH pathway—which is different from Clostridium (Table 2). The key catalyst in the PFL pathway is a compound enzyme composed of formate hydrolyase (FHL), Hyd-3, and FDH-H, which catalyzes the oxidation of endogenous formic acid to CO2 and provides the electrons and protons to generate H2. The NADH pathway relies on the NADH oxidase located on the outer membrane of the cell to catalyze the conversion of NADH to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which generates electrons that then combine with protons to form hydrogen via the Hyd located on the inner membrane (Sun et al., 2015). Additional research has shown that the over-expression of the large (HycE) and small (HycG) subunit-encoding genes of NiFe-H2ase substantially improved Hyd activity in E. aerogenes (Zhao et al., 2017a); while the knockout of hycE, hycF, and hycG genes, which encode different subunits of Hyd-3, inhibited the NADH hydrogen production pathway (Pi et al., 2016). The knockout and over-expression of the FDH-H-encoding gene fdhF and FHL-encoding gene fhlA, respectively, substantially changed the redox equilibrium and energy level of E. aerogenes cells, suggesting that hydrogen production in E. aerogenes is not only dependent on Hyd but is also regulated by different enzymes in the whole metabolic pathway (Lu et al., 2009b). In addition, the hyd gene (hoxEFUYH) of Synechocystis was cloned and heterologously expressed in E. aerogenes, resulting in substantial improvement of the hydrogen production of this recombinant E. aerogenes (Song et al., 2016). H2 metabolism mechanisms have also been studied in other common HPB (Table 2). Analysis of a draft genome sequence of Thermoanaerobacterium sp., isolated from a high-temperature hydrogen-producing reactor, showed that it had NiFe-H2ase-encoding genes related to hydrogen production (O-Thong et al., 2017). A metagenomic analysis including Vibrio tritonius showed that the compound enzyme FHL composed of FDH-H, fhl-A type transcriptional activator, mature hydrogenase protein (Hyp), and NiFe-H2ase (HyfG), acted as key enzymes during hydrogen production (Matsumura et al., 2015). Citrobacter amalonaticus can oxidize carbon monoxide (CO) to H2 through a water-vapor conversion reaction catalyzed by a unique CO oxidation enzyme system composed of a CO-dependent hydrogenase (CO-Hyd), a CO dehydrogenase (CODH), and a CO-sensing transcriptional activator (cooA) (Ainala et al., 2014). Research has also shown that the Hyd of Sulfurospirillum sp. is similar to that of E. coli, which catalyzes hydrogen production during pyruvate fermentation (Kruse et al., 2018)."
7,Molecular regulation by pH and liquid end-products,
8,The regulatory mechanism of pH,"4.1 The regulatory mechanism of pH pH is an important environmental factor that has a substantial impact on the growth and metabolic pathways of HPB (Li et al., 2020c). It can also impact the interactions between HPB and partner microbes by mediating the activity of intracellular enzymes, and even influence what fermentation type forms in hydrogen-producing reactors by shaping the microbial communities (Li et al., 2019a; Lund et al., 2014; Olson, 1993). Low pH was shown to favor the establishment of ETF and inhibit both butyric acid- and propionic acid-type fermentation and methanogenesis (Ren et al., 1997; Ren et al., 2007b; Xing et al., 2008a). The control of pH can maintain the stability of hydrogen production via ETF (Wu et al., 2017b). Recent research has shown that the initial pH substantially affects cell growth and the production of fermentation metabolites in E. harbinense, permitting the construction of a transcriptional regulation network of ethanol-H2 co-metabolism under pH stress based on transcriptomic analysis (Li et al., 2020c). Multiple pathways involved in carbon and energy metabolism, biosynthesis, cell growth and reproduction, signal transduction, and resistance mechanisms (PTS, chemotaxis, and the antioxidant system) were shown to be co-regulated at the transcriptional level in E. harbinense (Li et al., 2020c). The expression of cell growth- and acidogenesis-related genes (such as cell division protein-encoding genes and ack) was significantly down-regulated under low initial pH conditions, while H2 production- and acidogenesis-related genes (such as hyd, ferredoxin-encoding genes, adh, and ack) were down-regulated under high initial pH conditions (Fig. 7 ) (Li et al., 2020c). However, transcriptome data show that low initial pH had no substantial influence on the expression of hyd, 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-encoding genes, or the PFOR-encoding gene, suggesting that the activities of H2-metabolic-related enzymes were not altered by low pH (Li et al., 2020c). The accumulation of metabolites during dark fermentation lead to the gradual decrease in pH value to about 4.0 without artificially control (Li et al., 2020d). Due to the limitation of low pH on the metabolic pathway and hydrogenase activity, most HPB reduced or even lost their hydrogen production capacity (Guo et al., 2008). However, low pH (4.0–5.0) only affected the expression of genes related to cell growth and proliferation of E. harbinense, but remained the higher activity of H2-metabolic enzymes such as [FeFe]-H2ase and ferredoxin (Li et al., 2020c). The neutral fermentation product (ethanol), granular autoaggregates, and highly active [FeFe]-H2ases and ferredoxins enable E. harbinense to produce H2 at low pH (4.0–4.5). Thus, although the optimum pH for growth metabolism and hydrogen production was approximately 6.0–7.0, E. harbinense can tolerate a relatively lower pH (4.0–4.5) to produce H2, which is beneficial to compete with other HPB and prevail in the acidophilic hydrogen-producing communities (Li et al., 2020c; Ren et al., 2007b; Xing et al., 2008a). This metabolic regulation of Ethanoligenens under pH stress clearly suggests that switching pH may be a robust strategy for establishing a stable ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen-producing community."
9,The molecular mechanism of acetic acid tolerance in Ethanoligenens,"4.2 The molecular mechanism of acetic acid tolerance in Ethanoligenens Acetic acid is another liquid end-product of E. harbinense that accumulates easily in the fermentation broth, resulting in a decrease in pH. This decrease in pH can lead to passive diffusion of the undissociated acetic acid into the bacterial cell where it can then dissociate to produce H+ inside the cell and cause intracellular acidification. Intracellular acidification is generally detrimental to cells, as it leads to the inhibition of glycolysis-related enzymes, eventually inhibiting the energy metabolism in bacteria (Trček et al., 2015). Inhibition of glycolysis results in a decrease in the production of pyruvate, which can indirectly inhibit H2 production because pyruvate is an important intermediate product in the hydrogen production process in E. harbinense (Li et al., 2019a). In addition, intracellular acidification has been shown to be deleterious to the stability and integrity of macromolecular structures, including proteins and nucleic acids inside cells, and generates instability in cell structure and metabolism (Slonczewski et al., 2009). Quantitative proteomic analysis has shown that some PTS proteins in E. harbinense are down-regulated under acetic acid stress, decreasing the ability of the cells to take up carbon sources and further affecting the metabolism of energy and substances (Fig. 5) (Li et al., 2019a). In addition, acetic acid stress led to changes in the expression of key proteins in the phosphate specific transporter system (Pst system), which hindered the absorption of phosphorus by E. harbinense and further inhibited hydrogen production in HPB (Li et al., 2019a). In another study, acetic acid stress triggered the expression of regulatory proteins that activate defense mechanisms in cells, such as DNA and protein structural repair mediated by oxidative stress and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as a means to resist the damage to intracellular structure caused by acidification (Ferreira et al., 2015). In addition, the expressions of key enzymes involved in the reductive pyrimidine decomposition process in E. harbinense (such as dihydropyrimidinase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and beta-alanine synthase) were up-regulated to provide more carbon and nitrogen to the cells, promoting the synthesis of pantothenic acid and coenzyme A. The metabolic production of alkaline substances (such as NH3) partially neutralized the H+ generated by the dissociation of acetic acid to maintain a relatively stable intracellular metabolism (Li et al., 2019a; Liu et al., 2015c)."
10,The ethanologenic metabolic regulation of Ethanoligenens,"4.3 The ethanologenic metabolic regulation of Ethanoligenens The accumulation of ethanol can result in metabolic inhibition and substantially alter the yield of other terminal metabolites as well as microbial biomass in ETF. Previous studies have shown that bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), a key enzyme for ethanol production, has an important physiological function in E. harbinense and is present at high levels in cells (Fig. 5). Ethanol accumulation dramatically increases the expression of Adh protein in E. harbinense and thus increases ethanol yield, which leads to inhibition of acetic acid production because of competition for acetyl-CoA with ethanol (Li et al., 2019b). Ethanol accumulation also results in a distinct increase in the expression of glycolytic-related enzymes, which leads to the production of more nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and pyruvate to resist the metabolic inhibition of ethanol (Contreras et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b). Carbon and nitrogen metabolisms in E. harbinense are similar to that previously reported in Clostridium thermocellum; indeed, in both organisms, ethanol stress was shown to regulate the expression of related functional proteins involved in the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen (Li et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2012). Endogenously produced guanidine is an important component of the guanidine-I riboswitches in bacteria, which are responsible for coordinating the expression of transporters and nitrogen metabolism-related genes (Breaker et al., 2017; Sherlock and Breaker, 2017). Ethanol accumulation is known to facilitate the production of guanidine, which binds to guanidine-I riboswitches and leads to the expression of relevant genes controlled by the switch. For example, the expression of desulfoferrodoxin (Alsaker et al., 2010), glutathione peroxidase, and histidine (van Bokhorst-van de Veen et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013) were up-regulated under oxidative stress, acid stress (such as acetic acid and butyric acid stress), and ethanol stress, effectively protecting Clostridium from these abiotic stresses."
11,Challenges and prospects,"Compared with butyric acid- and mixed acid-type fermentation, ETF produces hydrogen with greater efficiency and has several additional characteristics that can benefit subsequent anaerobic biotreatment processes (Li et al., 2009; Li et al., 2019c). The fermentation products of ETF (ethanol, H2, and acetic acid) are ideal as substrates for chain elongation (CE) to produce medium chain fatty acids (MCFA). Both ethanol and hydrogen can used as electron donors of CE to provide the reductive equivalent and energy, while acetic acid can serve as one of the electron acceptors for CE reaction (Ding et al., 2010; Steinbusch et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2017). Previous researches have indicated that ethanol is used in priority as electron donor than H2, and is considered as the most efficient reduced substrate for CE (Liu et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2017). A high ratio of ethanol to acetate (2.3:1) (theoretical molar ratio is 2:1) enhanced the caproate production through caproate/butyrate fermentation by Clostridium kluyveri (Yin et al., 2017). Compared to other fermentation types, ETF is able to provide suitable substrate (the ratio of ethanol/acetate is 1–3:1) for caproate fermentation by C. kluyveri, which makes it more conducive to CE. Meanwhile, ETF and CE are both anaerobic biological processes which have similar reaction conditions (such as temperature and pH) and complementary nutrient requirements, and theoretically have the feasibility of continuous processing. Thus, coupling ETF with CE may alleviate the inhibition of ethanol and acetic acid accumulation on ETF, which contributes to the improvement of H2 production efficiency, while producing high-value MCFA. Besides serving as good substrates for carbon chain elongation by Clostridium spp., the main liquid products (ethanol and acetic acid) of ETF can also serve as substrates for different biological end-products, such as biofuels, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (Agler et al., 2012; Bakonyi et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2017). For this reason, ETF has received much attention from researchers; however, many challenges remain regarding the industrial application of this process. When transitioning from laboratory-scale to large-scale applications, substrate utilization efficiency towards hydrogen production decreases for both ethanol-type and butyric acid-type fermentation. Further elaboration of the metabolic mechanisms within ethanol-H2 co-producing bacteria and their interactions with other microorganisms could provide essential knowledge necessary for the development of new control strategies for enhancing hydrogen production at industrial scales."
12,Regulation of ETF by environmental factors,"5.1 Regulation of ETF by environmental factors Previous research has succeeded in over-expressing the hyd enzyme from E. harbinense heterologously in E. coli to produce recombinant bacteria with highly efficient hydrogen-producing activity (Zhao et al., 2010). The hydrogen yield of a genetically engineered E. aerogenes with impaired NADH dehydrogenase activity was improved by modifying the FHL and NADH pathways (Wu et al., 2017a). The spontaneous mutant of Thermotoga maritima was constructed using a transient gene inactivation strategy to enhance H2 production with the H2 yield of more than 4 mol of H2/mol-glucose by block lactate production (Singh et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019). These studies provide a model not only for the design of genetically engineered bacteria for high H2 yield, but also for functional studies of various proteins in ethanol fermentation HPB using methods such as gene knock-out, gene silencing, and gene over-expression (Zhao et al., 2010). Recent whole-genome studies have elucidated the metabolic pathway of ethanol-H2 co-production as well as the mechanisms of metabolite inhibition in E. harbinense (Li et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2019c), improving our overall understanding of the molecular mechanism of ETF. The addition of L-cysteine, Mg2+, and Fe2+ was shown to increase H2 production efficiency in ethanol-H2 co-production fermentation by E. harbinense (Zhao et al., 2017b). Titanium dioxide and magnetic hematite nanoparticles also improved the H2-metabolism in Clostridium pasteurianum at the transcriptional level (Hsieh et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). Strategies that alter the intracellular redox potential, such as imposing an applied potential or adding electron mediators to the fermentation broth, can also influence H2-metabolism pathways and permit the targeting of specific products in electro-fermentation (EF) systems (Arunasri et al., 2020; Paiano et al., 2019). This may also work as a strategy to enhance hydrogen production in ETF. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed effects of metal ions and other factors to enhance H2 production are complex and have not been sufficiently studied. Meanwhile, much effort has been made towards solving the issue of the operational instability of ETF. Elaboration of the regulatory mechanism of pH has enabled accurate and effective control strategies for ETF. Other operating parameters, such as temperature and HRT, can influence community structure in hydrogen-producing reactors, resulting in different metabolic pathways and fermentation types occurring that can ultimately affect the hydrogen production efficiency of the process (Ferreira et al., 2018). Enabling the autoaggregation of HPB to provide bioaugmentation is an approach that has been shown to enhance the abundance of desired functional populations and improve the resilience of the community to external environmental stressors, while improving H2 production in ETF (Okonkwo et al., 2020). However, the specific interspecies interactions in ETF systems remain unknown. This knowledge is needed for the prompt and accurate control of these systems and for maintaining long-term and stable hydrogen production."
13,Improvement of H2 production by interspecies electron transfer (IET) and microbial interaction,"5.2 Improvement of H2 production by interspecies electron transfer (IET) and microbial interaction Interspecies electron transfer (IET) in microbial communities plays a key role in anaerobic fermentation. The specific capabilities of E. harbinense in autoaggregation and coaggregation contribute to the formation of anaerobic granules or biofilms and the close interactions with other bacteria, which help to prevent the loss of cell biomass and a decrease in pH and improve IET efficiency in continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors (Xing et al., 2006; Xing et al., 2008b). The metabolites of Ethanoligenens can be further served as carbon sources or electron donors for the growth of partner microbes (Claassen et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019c). A latest study proved the cross-feeding interaction between E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens and direct physical interaction by nanowire-like structure in the aggregates in co-cultured anaerobic fermentation and MECs (Li et al., 2020a). However, insight into the electron transfer mechanisms (ETM) within and between these autoaggregations or coaggregations is still limited. Research on the aggregate formation mechanisms and ETMs of other microorganisms may provide some reference points for the study of these mechanisms in E. harbinense. Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) occurred in a co-culture of Geobacter metallireducens and Geobacter sulfurreducens, while a specific mutation in G. sulfurreducens enhanced c-type cytochrome production and promoted extracellular electron transfer (EET) and aggregate formation (Summers et al., 2010). Another study revealed a DIET mechanism in the thermophilic anaerobic oxidation of methane within autoaggregative granules between anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Wegener et al., 2015). The mechanism of DIET-based methanogenic metabolism indicates that DIET serves as the only route for the reduction of carbon dioxide for the support of cell growth, and that DIET is facilitated via the formation of aggregates containing a conductive pili network in Methanothrix-dominant communities (Zhao et al., 2020). All of these aforementioned research strategies can be applied to investigate the IET mechanisms in anaerobic granules or biofilms of ETF systems. In addition, the DIET pathway of ethanol fermentation HPB needs to be further elucidated, and the proposed NADH+H+ pathway in these HPB remains unconfirmed. Additional studies of IET in these bacteria are necessary to improve hydrogen production in ETF and to expand its applications (Fig. 8 ). Syntrophic interactions between fermentative HPB and acetic acid-utilizing bacteria can alleviate the inhibitory effect of accumulated acetic acid on hydrogen production and lead to the improvement of hydrogen production efficiency (Zhang et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2013b). The coupling process of photo fermentation and dark fermentation is another promising strategy for enhancing H2 yield. Although the difference in the growth rate between photosynthetic HPB and fermentative HPB often causes ineffective hydrogen production, photosynthetic HPB are able to consume volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced by fermentative HPB and mitigate a fast pH dropping in the co-culture. Co-cultures of Clostridium cellulovorans and Rhodopseudomonas palustris have been shown to enhance hydrogen production through syntrophic interactions between dark fermentative and photosynthetic bacteria (Lu et al., 2016). Research has also shown that H2 production can be promoted by co-cultures of E. harbinense with the photo-fermenter Rhodopseudomonas faecalis through cross-feeding interaction and aggregate formation (Liu et al., 2015b). Therefore, the configurations and operating conditions of the integrated dark- and photo-fermentative reactors need to be further optimized, the molecular interaction mechanism between photosynthetic HPB and fermentative HPB also need to be further studied. An approach called sequential immobilization and deoxygenization (SIDO), based on the granulation or biofilm formation of ethanol fermentation HPB with facultative aerobic bacteria, has been proposed to accelerate the start-up period and enhance hydrogen production efficiency in continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors."
14,Integration of ETF into microbial electrochemical systems (MESs),"5.3 Integration of ETF into microbial electrochemical systems (MESs) ETF is compatible with microbial electrochemical technologies (METs), such as microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and EF, which can be used to further enhance hydrogen production (Jiang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2012). The acetic acid and ethanol present in the fermentation broth of ethanol fermentation HPB are easily utilized by the electroactive bacteria that dominate in MECs; thus, this broth could serve as a potential feedstock to MECs (Lu et al., 2009a). Studies have identified the main mechanisms of several syntrophic interactions in MECs, including interactions between fermentative bacteria and electroactive bacteria; interactions among fermentative bacteria, acetogenic bacteria, and electroactive bacteria; and interactions between fermentative bacteria and methanogens (Lu et al., 2011; Lu and Ren, 2016). Molecular studies on the interaction mechanisms between ethanol fermentation HPB and other microorganisms in these systems are still needed as they could provide new insight into the processes that convert organic waste into H2. This knowledge could enhance H2 production in MECs through the control of microbial communities. Indeed, a novel process of EF that incorporates polarized electrodes within the fermentation has already been applied to regulate microbial fermentative metabolism (Moscoviz et al., 2016; Schievano et al., 2016). EF can regulate fermentative pathways by changing the extracellular ORP and electron flux, which aids the selection of certain fermentation products (Choi et al., 2014; Hirose et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018). Thus, additional study of the metabolic mechanisms of ethanol fermentation HPB and the effects that different operation conditions (such as electrode potentials, electron mediators, and substrates) have on the hydrogen production mechanisms of fermentative bacteria in EF systems is invaluable. Since the pH value of ETF drops naturally to 4.0–4.5 (Ren et al., 2007b), which is not suitable for the growth and EET of electroactive bacteria in MESs. However, the co-culture of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens effectively enhanced hydrogen production and ethanol concentration and maintained a higher pH (~5.5) in anaerobic fermentation or MESs through forming granular aggregates, suggesting that the granulation of HPB and VFAs-oxidizing bacteria will be a new approach to solve the pH imbalance (Li et al., 2020a). Additionally, EET plays a significant role in METs (Choi et al., 2014; Logan, 2009; Schroeder, 2007); however, hardly any systematic studies have examined the role of EET in ethanol fermentation HPB in METs yet is urgently needed. Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics methods can be used to further elucidate the interactive mechanisms between ethanol fermentation HPB and other microorganisms, especially the electroactive bacteria. Deeper insight into the molecular regulation mechanisms and syntrophic interaction mechanisms of ETF could provide fundamental information that could be used to improve hydrogen production and provide optimized regulation strategies for large-scale applications."
15,Conclusions,"ETF has excellent potential for promoting renewable energy recovery from waste streams because of its high H2 production efficiency, acid-tolerance, and its autoaggregative and ethanologenic characteristics. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying ethanol production by HPB will be critically important for the application of this type of biohydrogen production, and provide the basic knowledge required to develop effective regulatory strategies in practice. This review has summarized the molecular mechanisms based on the analysis of the H2-metabolism pathways in ethanol fermentation HPB and enumerated the problems and challenges associated with H2 production by these bacteria. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular and regulatory response mechanisms of these bacteria to different environmental factors as well as the interactive mechanisms between ethanol fermentation HPB and other microorganisms. A better understanding of these mechanisms will be critically important for supporting the complex needs of biohydrogen production."
