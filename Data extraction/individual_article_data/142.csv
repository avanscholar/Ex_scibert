0,Introduction,"The transition toward renewable energy is a key target for climate change mitigation. Developing and using low-carbon energy from biomass to produce biofuels is a challenge to achieving this transition [1]. Gaseous biofuels, including biogas, biomethane, and hydrogen, produced by anaerobic digestion (AD) are generally considered sustainable energy resources because they tend to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while contributing to economic growth [2]. Furthermore, biofuels produced from crop residues and energy crops are increasingly attractive, because they do not compete with food crops [3]. Napier grass is considered a competitive energy crop that can be used as a feedstock for biofuels and bio-based chemical products. This is because of its rapid growth, high biomass production, high protein content, and strong adaptation to different environments [4,5]. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the main components of Napier grass and silage, and can be converted into fermentable sugars via hydrolysis. These sugars can then be consumed by microorganisms and converted into gaseous biofuels by AD. However, lignin limits enzymatic hydrolysis by serving as a physical barrier to the digestible material, thus inhibiting enzymatic activity [6,7]. Therefore, pretreatment methods, such as alkaline pretreatment [8], dilute-acid pretreatment [9], steam explosion [10], fungal pretreatment [11], and low-moisture anhydrous ammonia pretreatment [12], have been applied to delignify lignocellulose of Napier grass before enzymatic hydrolysis. Among the pretreatment technologies available, the organosolv method has been reported to be successful in biomass refinery with improved conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars [13–15]. The addition of acid and alkali catalysts to the organosolv method has been reported to accelerate xylan degradation and delignification [15,16]. However, solvents are costly [17] and the procedure requires an appropriate method of recovery for the reuse of solvents. Compared with pretreatment with the organosolv process, the hydrothermal pretreatment has lower costs and greater simplicity because only water is used in the process, in which biomass is cooked with water at high temperatures (150–230 °C). Hydrothermal pretreatment causes hemicellulose hydrolysis and changes the properties of cellulose and lignin [18]. The use of lignocellulosic materials for the production of hydrogen typically involves three steps: pretreatment, hydrolysis, and acidogenesis [19]. In the hydrolysis stage, cellulose is enzymatically hydrolyzed to fermentable sugars; however, the enzyme-hydrolyzed process can be inhibited by commodity sugars like cellobiose and glucose [20,21]. To prevent product inhibition, combination enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes, also known as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), have been conducted [22,23]. During SSF, glucose produced by the action of the cellulase enzyme is directly consumed by fermenting microorganisms, which mitigates product inhibition. SSF is suitable for hydrogen production because it not only increases the hydrogen yield by preventing product inhibition during cellulose hydrolysis, but also requires a shorter time and reduces investment costs because of the need for only one reactor [19,24]. In this study, SSF was employed to enhance the efficacy of bio-hydrogen production from Napier grass and silage. The downside of hydrogen fermentation is the incomplete processing of organic biomass [25]. Its hydrogenic effluent includes volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and solid residues with high chemical oxygen demand [25,26]. These organic substances must be utilized to achieve complete conversion of organic biomass [25]. VFAs are easily converted to methane by methanogenic bacteria via two-stage AD [27], in which the first stage is hydrogen production and the second stage is methane production. Therefore, to accomplish the complete utilization of Napier grass and silage and improve the overall energy recovery, two-stage bio-hydrogen and methane production were conducted. The goal of this study was to enhance the SSF of Napier grass and silage for bio-hydrogen production using organosolv and hydrothermal methods. The hydrogenic effluent was further used to produce methane to obtain a satisfactory energy yield and completely utilize the biomass. Subsequently, the energy yield from the two-stage bio-hydrogen and methane production was calculated and compared with the one-stage methane production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum preparation,"2.1 Inoculum preparation An anaerobic Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 culture (GenBank accession no. JN020648) was provided by Dr. Sontaya Khamtib [28]. Strain KKU 19 was isolated from hot spring sediments from Yala Province, Thailand. The optimum temperature for strain KKU19 is 60 °C [28]. The KKU19 strain was enriched in a modified basic anaerobic medium (BA), modified from Angelidaki and Sanders [29] with the addition of 10 g/L of mixed sugars as carbon sources, that is, 5 g/L of glucose and 5 g/L of xylose. Subsequently, the pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.5, by the addition of either 5 N NaOH or 5 N HCl. The culture was incubated at 55 °C on an incubated shaker for 24 h before use as a hydrogen producer. Anaerobic sludge was collected from the biogas plant of SF Khon Kaen Co., Ltd. (Khon Kaen, Thailand). The plant was used to produce biogas from the Napier silage and chicken manure. Afterward, the anaerobic sludge was cultivated with 10 g of Napier silage and incubated at room temperature (35 ± 2 °C) for 3 weeks. The cultivated anaerobic sludge was filtered to remove non-degradable material before use as the inoculum. Total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) of anaerobic sludge were 102.5 ± 1.1 and 68.3 ± 0.4 g/kg, respectively."
3,Raw materials,"2.2 Raw materials Napier grass and silage were collected from SF Khon Kaen Co., Ltd. (Khon Kaen, Thailand). Mature Napier grass was harvested after 60 days of growth. Napier silage was prepared by ensiling fresh Napier grass in a closed container under anaerobic conditions for 2 weeks. Both materials were dried in a hot air oven and blended using a food blender. They were then passed through a 40-mesh screen to obtain a particle size of less than 0.425 mm. The samples were stored at room temperature prior to use."
4,Pretreatment of raw materials,"2.3 Pretreatment of raw materials For the organosolv pretreatment, sodium hydroxide was applied as a catalyst for the Napier grass, while sulfuric acid was used as a catalyst for the Napier silage. In the case of the hydrothermal pretreatment, sulfuric acid was used as the catalyst for both Napier grass and silage with the highest hemicellulose removal of 85% and 83% for both hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass and silage, respectively. For organosolv pretreatment, sodium hydroxide as a catalyst could improve the lignin removal at a maximum of 54% for organosolv pretreated Napier grass, while sulfuric acid as a catalyst could enhance the maximum lignin removal of 46% of organosolv pretreated Napier silage. Moreover, the non-catalyzed organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatments (auto-catalyzed organosolv and auto-catalyzed hydrothermal) of Napier grass and silage were also used as controls. The experimental setups for the organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatments of Napier grass and silage are listed in Table 1 . Pretreatment was carried out in 150 mL high-pressure stainless-steel vessels with a working volume of 100 mL. For the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment of Napier grass, 10 g of dried Napier grass was mixed with 100 mL of 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol containing 1% (w/w) (dry weight) NaOH as a catalyst. For the sulfuric acid-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment of Napier silage, 10 g of dried Napier silage was mixed with 100 mL of 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol containing 1% w/w H2SO4 as a catalyst. Auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreatments with 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol were also conducted. The reaction mixture was heated in an oil bath at 190 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, organosolv pretreated solids were washed with 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, followed by distilled water several times, until a pH of 7.0 was obtained. In the case of sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment of Napier grass and silage, 10 g of dried Napier grass or silage were mixed with distilled water and 1% (w/w) H2SO4 as the catalyst. The auto-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment was conducted using distilled water without the addition of H2SO4. The heating process was the same as that for the organosolv pretreatment, and the hydrothermally pretreated solids were also washed several times with distilled water until a pH of 7.0 was attained. Both the organosolv and hydrothermally pretreated solids were dried at 60 °C in a hot-air oven overnight. The pretreated solids were stored at room temperature before analyzing their chemical compositions and using them as substrates in the AD process. The compositions of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the untreated and pretreated solids are shown in Fig. 1 ."
5,SSF and two-stage hydrogen and methane production,"2.4 SSF and two-stage hydrogen and methane production The SSF hydrogen production process was conducted at 50 °C, which was reported as a suitable temperature for SSF hydrogen production from oil palm trunk using KKU19 [30]. Batch SSF for hydrogen production was performed in 120 mL serum bottles with a solid loading of 3.5% (w/v). A 1.5 g portion of pretreated Napier grass or silage (section 2.3) and 42 mL of fermentation broth were added to the serum bottles. The fermentation broth consisted of a 50 mM sodium citrate buffer of pH 6.0, containing a modified BA medium that without yeast extract and NaHCO3 (modified from Angelidaki and Sanders [29]). A 20-filter paper unit (FPU) cellulase/g-biomass and 100 mg/L of yeast extract solution were added to each bottle. The cell pellets of KKU19 were added as the inoculum in 20% (v/v) proportion of the working volume. For the control experiments, untreated Napier grass and silage were used. The bottles were then sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps and purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to create anaerobic conditions and incubated at 50 °C in an incubator shaker at 150 rpm. During incubation, the volume of biogas was measured using a wetted glass syringe method [31]. Gas samples were analyzed for biogas content using gas chromatography (GC). At the end of hydrogen production, the VFA concentrations and residue reducing sugars of the hydrogenic effluents were determined. All treatments were performed in triplicate. At the end of the hydrogen fermentation process, the serum bottles were opened, and 20 g VS/L of anaerobic sludge was added as the inoculum. NaHCO3, at a concentration of 2.5 g/L, was added as a buffer. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0, using 5 M HCl or 5 M NaOH. Subsequently, the serum bottles were capped with an aluminum cap and purged with nitrogen gas to create anaerobic conditions before incubation at room temperature. Gas samples were taken from the serum bottles for analysis of the methane content with GC."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The TS and VS of the anaerobic sludge were determined according to standard methods [32]. The chemical compositions of the untreated and pretreated biomass were analyzed using a standard procedure developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [33]. The surface morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6610LV, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan)). The cell concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 600 nm. One unit of absorbance was equivalent to 0.4500 g dry cell/L. The reducing sugars were analyzed using the 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method [34]. The concentrations of sugars, VFAs, and alcohol in the hydrogenic effluents were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (LC-10AD, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a refractive index detector and an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The HPLC conditions followed the method of Nualsri et al. [26]. Biogas composition was analyzed using a GC (GC-2014, Shimadzu) with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2-m stainless steel column packed with Shin carbon (50/80 mesh). The operating conditions followed the method described by Sitthikitpanya et al. [30]. The volumes of hydrogen and methane were calculated using the mass balance equation [35]. The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) was applied to fit the cumulative hydrogen and methane production curves [36]: (1) H = P e x p { − exp [ R m × e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } H is the cumulative amount of hydrogen and methane produced (mL/L). P and Rm are the hydrogen and methane production potential (mL/L) and maximum hydrogen and methane production rates (mL H2/L.h and mL CH4/L.d), respectively. The lag-phase (λ) and incubation time (t) are reported in units of hours (h) and days (d). e is exp (1) = 2.718. The parameters (P, Rm, and λ) were estimated using a non-linear curve fitting in SigmaPlot 11 (Systat Software Inc., USA). The hydrogen and methane yields were calculated as the hydrogen and methane production potential (mL/L) divided by the amount of substrate added (g-substrateadded/L). The energy yield (kJ/g-substrateadded) was determined by multiplying the gas yield (hydrogen or methane, L/g-substrateadded) and the energy content of hydrogen (10.8 kJ/L (STP) equivalent to 121 kJ/g-H2) or methane (36 kJ/L (STP) equivalent to 50 kJ/g-CH4) [26]. The total energy yield (TEY) was calculated by adding the energy yields of hydrogen and methane. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Analysis of variance test followed by Duncan's multiple range test was used at a significance level of p < 0.05."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Chemical compositions of pretreated Napier grass and silage,"3.1 Chemical compositions of pretreated Napier grass and silage The maximal cellulose content of Napier grass was obtained from the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment (Fig. 1A). The addition of catalysts in the organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatment effectively breaks down the hemicellulose structure and solubilizes the hemicellulose fraction of the Napier grass, increasing the cellulose content and making it suitable for further degradation to fermentable sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis [37]. Therefore, these results indicate that the organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatment with and without catalysts could significantly improve the cellulose content of Napier grass and silage. The process of the organosolv pretreatment involves the extraction of lignin from biomass while leaving a high-purity solid cellulose-rich fraction [38]. For the hydrothermal pretreatment process, the mechanism involving water under high pressure can penetrate the biomass, hydrate the cellulose, hydrolyze the hemicellulose, and fractionate the lignin [39]. In addition, sulfuric acid can be added as a catalyst in both pretreatment processes because it can cleave α- and β-aryl ether bonds to help fractionate lignin fragments [40]. Moreover, sodium hydroxide has been used as an alkali solution for treating biomass. The mechanism of the alkali is that it can cleaves the intermolecular ester bonds that crosslink between hemicelluloses and other components in biomass [40]. The hemicellulose content measured in the untreated Napier grass (Fig. 1A) and untreated Napier silage (Fig. 1B) were 26.9% and 26.4%, respectively. When Napier grass was pretreated with the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal treatment, a decrease in hemicellulose content of 7.9% was observed (Fig. 1A), while the hemicellulose content of the Napier silage pretreated with the sulfuric acid-catalyzed organosolv and hydrothermal treatments decreased to 15.7% and 7.9%, respectively (Fig. 1B). The results indicated that sulfuric acid was an efficient catalyst for the removal of hemicellulose from Napier grass by hydrothermal pretreatment, and Napier silage pretreated by organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatment. Furthermore, Chen et al. [41]. reported that the addition of acid resulted in a greater removal of xylan owing to the increased concentration of H+, which catalyzed the xylan hydrolysis. The lignin content in the organosolv pretreated Napier grass and silage with/without catalysts was significantly lower than that in the untreated materials (Fig. 1A and B). The lowest lignin content was found when Napier grass was pretreated with the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv process (Fig. 1A). Sodium hydroxide efficiently extracts hemicellulose from lignin with minimal loss. This result was in agreement with a previous analysis [42], which found that pretreatment of bamboo biomass with diluted sodium hydroxide led to the successful removal of lignin, effectively increasing the concentration of cellulose [42]. The lignin content of pretreated Napier grass obtained from sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal treatment was comparable to that of untreated Napier grass (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the lignin content after the Napier silage was pretreated by hydrothermal treatment without catalysts was comparable to that of the untreated Napier silage (Fig. 1B). During hydrothermal pretreatment, a two-step lignin breakdown reaction occurred. First, lignin fragments were solubilized by breaking the bonds between the lignin and carbohydrates. Subsequently, re-polymerization of the lignin occurred in the presence of organic acids generated by hydrothermal pretreatment, resulting in insoluble condensation products [18]. As a result, a longer reaction time allowed the lignin re-polymerization stage to prevail."
9,SSF for hydrogen production from pretreated Napier grass and silage,"3.2 SSF for hydrogen production from pretreated Napier grass and silage In SSF, cellulose hydrolysis by enzyme and sugar fermentation by T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 simultaneously occurred in one reactor [30]. The sugar produced during enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis was immediately consumed by strain KKU19 to produce hydrogen. Therefore, SSF is the process of combining the hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps in the AD process. The SSF results for the hydrogen production process are presented and discussed below. The hydrogen production, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen production rate varied with the various contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin after the pretreatment process (Table 2 ). In the case of the Napier grass, the organosolv pretreatment substantially improved hydrogen production compared with hydrothermal pretreatment and non-pretreatment (Table 2). The highest hydrogen production of 3398 ± 261 mL/L was obtained from the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv-pretreated Napier grass. However, there was no significant difference in hydrogen production from the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass. In addition, the hydrogen production from the sulfuric acid-hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass was not significantly different from that of the auto-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass (Table 2). The results indicated that the addition of catalysts to the organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatments did not improve hydrogen production. However, the lag-phase period of hydrogen production from the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment was significantly (p < 0.05) shorter than those of auto-catalyzed organosolv and the hydrothermal pretreatments and non-pretreatment (Table 2). The high hydrogen production and short lag-phase time obtained from organosolv pretreatment could be due to the low lignin content in the organosolv pretreated materials (Fig. 1A). Lignin acts as a physical barrier to prevent the access of cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze the cellulose portion, thus reducing hydrolysis efficiency [6,7]. The limitation of the enzymatic hydrolysis step consequently affected the acidogenesis step in the SSF process. This is because T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 consumed the reducing sugar obtained from the hydrolysis step before converting it to hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the acidogenesis step. In addition, it was found that the lag-phase from the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreated Napier grass (160.5 ± 12.6 h) was significantly (p < 0.05) longer than that of the untreated Napier grass (63.7 ± 2.3 h) (Table 2). This may be because a lignin barrier was established in the sulfuric-acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass. Accordingly, the hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps during SSF from the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment of Napier grass was inhibited. However, the lignin contents in both substrates were not substantially different (Fig. 1A). Some tiny droplets distributed on the surface of the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreated Napier grass (Fig. 2 C) were observed by SEM morphological analysis. These could be redeposited lignin, known as pseudo-lignin, created by condensation from insoluble lignin [18,43]. Lignin redeposition has been recorded previously in poplar hydrothermal pretreatment [44,45], palm leaflet date [46], and beech wood [47]. In addition, Hu et al. [44] indicated that pseudo-lignin could react with products of sugar and/or sugar degradation, such as furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) produced during pretreatment with dilute acid. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been reported to be limited because of the pseudo-lignin droplets [44,45]. Thus, these findings suggest that pseudo-lignin collected on the surface of the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass may have negatively affected the processes of the cellulase enzyme and T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19. For this reason, a low hydrogen production and a long lag-phase time during SSF hydrogen production from the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass were observed. However, these droplets were not found on the surfaces of untreated (Fig. 2A) and auto-catalyzed organosolv-pretreated Napier grass samples (Fig. 2B). This is because the organosolv-pretreated Napier grass was washed with aqueous ethanol to avoid lignin deposition on the biomass surface [15,48]. Similar to the case of Napier grass, the use of auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier silage as a substrate for SSF hydrogen production resulted in higher hydrogen production and lower lag-phase time than the auto-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier silage (Table 2). In addition, the use of sulfuric acid-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier silage as a substrate provided a higher hydrogen production and shorter lag-phase time than that obtained from sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier silage (Table 2). Thus, to enhance hydrogen production from both Napier grass and silage, the organosolv pretreatment process was the best choice. The maximum hydrogen production of 3048.4 ± 178.7 mL/L was obtained from the sulfuric acid-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment; however, it was not significantly different from that of the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment (Table 2). The low hydrogen production and long lag-phase time obtained from the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier silage might be due to its high lignin content (Fig. 1B) and the pseudo-lignin inhibition as mentioned above. In addition, it was found that the auto-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lower hydrogen production and longer lag-phase time than those of the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment (Table 2). This may be because the use of H2SO4 as a catalyst in the hydrothermal pretreatment of Napier silage was effective in removing hemicellulose. The hemicellulose contents in the pretreated solids obtained from the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment were 12.2 ± 1.4% and 7.9 ± 0.2% (Fig. 1B), respectively, equal to 73% and 83% of hemicellulose removal efficiency (compared with untreated Napier silage). The decrease in hemicellulose content was attributed to the breakdown of hemicellulose into C5 atom sugars by sulfuric acid [41]. These results reveal that H2SO4 is an effective catalyst for the removal of hemicellulose. In addition, Hesami et al. [49] suggested that H2SO4 is an active catalyst for the degradation of the arabinan and xylan fractions in hemicellulose. Hemicellulose serves as a barrier surrounding the cellulose structure, which can shield the attack of the cellulase enzyme on the cellulose structure [39]. Therefore, the low hemicellulose content obtained from the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated solids might be easily digested by the cellulase enzyme, while the obtained sugar was further consumed by KKU19."
10,Soluble metabolite products (SMPs) and residue reducing sugar in hydrogenic effluent after SSF,"3.3 Soluble metabolite products (SMPs) and residue reducing sugar in hydrogenic effluent after SSF The SMPs in the hydrogenic effluents were analyzed at the steady state period of the SSF process (Fig. 3 ). Results found that the main SMPs were butyric and acetic acids, with small amounts of lactic acid. The observed butyric acid as a dominant metabolite suggested that hydrogen production during the SSF process was butyrate-type fermentation [26,50]. The concentrations of butyric and acetic acids obtained from the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed and auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreatments were higher than those obtained from the sulfuric acid-catalyzed and auto-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatments and non-pretreatment of Napier grass (Fig. 3A). This phenomenon was also observed when Napier silage was used as the substrate (Fig. 3B). Higher concentrations of butyric and acetic acids obtained from the organosolv pretreatment correlated with the production of hydrogen (Table 2). The presence of butyric and acetic acids is a good indicator of fermentative hydrogen production because the stoichiometry of hydrogen production revealed that two and 4 mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose are generated when butyric and acetic acid are the main metabolite products, respectively [51,52]. It was observed that the concentration of lactic acid in the hydrogenic effluents obtained from the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass was higher than that in the auto-catalyzed and sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass (Fig. 3A). In addition, the observed lactic acid concentration detected in the hydrogenic effluent from the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier silage was also higher than that in the auto-catalyzed and sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier silage (Fig. 3B). Theoretically, no hydrogen is produced when lactic acid is formed in the fermentation broth [53]. Thus, the observed lactic acid at high concentrations in the hydrogenic effluent of the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass correlated with the low hydrogen production (Table 2). The biochemical reactions with acetic, butyric, and lactic acids as metabolic end products are shown in Eqs. (2)–(4), respectively [25,54]. (2) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 (3) C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 (4) C6H12O6 → CH3CHOHCOOH + 2CO2 The residual reducing sugars in the hydrogenic effluent under all SSF conditions are depicted in Fig. 3. These results indicate that the reducing sugars produced by enzymatic hydrolysis could not be fully exploited by T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 to produce hydrogen. The concentration of the residual reducing sugars after the SSF process from the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass was higher than that of the auto-catalyzed and sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass (Fig. 3A). This phenomenon was also observed when Napier silage was used as the substrate (Fig. 3B). This might be because T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 was inhibited by pseudo-lignin, since it can react with furfural and HMF, as mentioned above. Furfural and HMF are furan derivatives that may hinder enzymes like glycolysis in fermentation reactions [55]. Quéméneur et al. [56] reported that furan derivatives strongly impacted hydrogen production from lignocellulosic-derived compounds in mixed cultures."
11,Effects of SMPs and residual sugar in hydrogenic effluents on methane production,"3.4 Effects of SMPs and residual sugar in hydrogenic effluents on methane production To complete the substrate utilization and energy recovery, hydrogenic effluents containing SMPs and reducing sugars from all treatments were subsequently used for methane production in the second stage of AD. In the AD process, methane is produced as a metabolite by-product by methanogenic microorganisms belonging to Archaea [57]. In the methanogenesis stage, approximately 70% of the methane is produced by the breakdown of acetic acid into methane and carbon dioxide, while the remaining 30% of methane is gained from the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen into methane [58]. The result showed that different initial concentrations of SMPs and reducing sugars affected methane production (Table 2). In the case of methane production from Napier grass, the maximum methane production of 5960.5 ± 68.0 mL/L was obtained from the hydrogenic effluent of auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass, followed by sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass (5760.2 ± 440.9 mL/L) (Table 2). The utilization of hydrogenic effluent from the auto-catalyzed and sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass as the substrate tended to yield a higher methane production than that from the hydrothermally pretreated and untreated Napier grass (Table 2). This may have been due to the hydrogenic effluents obtained from the organosolv pretreatment process containing a high concentration of total SMPs in the range of 5.7–6.1 g/L (Fig. 3A). However, these hydrogenic effluents contained lower concentrations of reducing sugars (3.3–4.0 g/L) than those of the hydrothermal pretreatments (4.9–5.3 g/L) (Fig. 3A). In the AD process, high-molecular-weight materials are hydrolyzed into small-molecular-weight materials (e.g., fatty acids, monomeric sugars, and amino acids) in the hydrolysis step. The organic substrate produced in the hydrolysis step is then degraded into VFAs (e.g., acetic, butyric, and propionic acid) in the acidogenesis step. Subsequently, VFAs are further degraded into acetic acid and CO2, which can be consumed by methanogens to produce methane [59]. Thus, SMPs such as butyric and acetic acid are more easily consumed by methanogens than reducing sugars [60]. Hydrogen was detected at the beginning of methane fermentation of the hydrothermally acidic effluent (data not shown). This may have been due to the acidogenic bacteria in the acidogenesis step converting sugars into hydrogen and VFAs. Accumulation of VFAs resulted in a decrease in pH in the AD system. Low pH adversely affects the activities of methanogens, resulting in the low methane production in the AD process that used the hydrogenic effluents of the auto-catalyzed and sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydrothermally pretreated Napier grass. In the case of Napier silage, the highest methane production and yield were obtained from the hydrogenic effluent of the auto-catalyzed organosolv-pretreated Napier silage, followed by the sulfuric acid-catalyzed organosolv-pretreated Napier silage (Table 2). However, total SMPs concentrations and residual sugar concentrations in the hydrogenic effluents were similar in both treatments (Fig. 3B). The differences in methane production and yield in both treatments might be due to the differences in the concentrations of residual organic solids (cellulose and hemicellulose) after the SSF process. The results indicate that microbes in the anaerobic sludge might favor utilizing organic solids such as hemicellulose rather than cellulose for methane production. Moreover, the hemicellulose structure was easily hydrolyzed and acidified by microbes, rather than the cellulose structure [61]. This finding is similar to that of Hesami et al. [49], who reported that methane production was more dependent on hemicellulose than on cellulose."
12,Energy yield analysis,"3.5 Energy yield analysis The distribution of energy from hydrogen and methane yields, as well as TEY, is shown in Fig. 4 . The energy distribution of the hydrogen and methane yields obtained from Napier grass was in the range of 6.7–9.6% and 90.4–93.3%, respectively (Fig. 4A). The stage of methane production revealed a greater energy production compared with the hydrogen production stage because of the higher yield (Table 2). For Napier silage, the energy distribution of the hydrogen and methane production was found to be between 7.4–9.4% and 90.6–92.6%, respectively (Fig. 4B). The highest TEY was obtained from the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment of both Napier grass and silage, 11.0 and 10.4 kJ/g-biomass, respectively (Fig. 4). However, the highest TEY (11.0 kJ/g-biomass) obtained from the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass was not significantly different from that of the sodium hydroxide-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier grass (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the TEY obtained from the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier silage was significantly (p < 0.05) different from that obtained using the sulfuric acid-catalyzed organosolv pretreated Napier silage as the substrate (Fig. 4B). The results show that the use of organosolv pretreatment without additional catalysts is suitable for pretreating both Napier grass and silage for two-stage hydrogen and methane production. Additionally, this process reduces the cost of the catalyst used in the organosolv pretreatment process. Moreover, the use of the organosolv pretreatment can improve the TEY when compared with that of the hydrothermal pretreatment. Additionally, the TEY generated from the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment was 1.2 and 1.3 times greater than that of untreated Napier grass (9.1 kJ/g-biomass) and silage (8.1 kJ/g-biomass), respectively. The comparison of the TEY from the two-stage hydrogen and methane production, obtained from this study, with the TEY from the one-stage methane production from Napier grass and silage from our previous work, shows that the TEY obtained from the two-stage hydrogen and methane production process was lower than that of the one-stage methane production. The highest TEY from the one-stage methane production was 13.8 and 12.2 kJ/g-biomass from the organosolv pretreatment of Napier grass and silage, respectively. This might be caused by the reduced methane yield of the two-stage hydrogen and methane production process, when compared with that of the one-stage methane production process. The low methane yield in this study might be due to the drawbacks of the SSF process, namely, the lower hydrolysis efficiency due to the difference between the optimal temperature and pH of the cellulase and microorganism mechanism compared with that obtained with separate hydrolysis and fermentation processes [21]. Previous studies have found that the efficiency of the SSF process depends on several factors, such as substrate concentration, enzyme dosage, and operating conditions [19,30,62]. Hence, to improve the hydrolysis efficiency, the factors affecting the SSF process should be optimized."
13,Conclusions,"Effective two-stage hydrogen and methane production from Napier grass and Napier silage was demonstrated using an organosolv pretreatment. The application of the organosolv pretreatment resulted in higher hydrogen production and hydrogen yield, with a lower lag-phase time compared with a hydrothermal pretreatment. The pseudo-lignin found on the hydrothermally pretreated surface under SEM images and the high lignin content were suggested to inhibit enzymatic hydrolysis and T. thermosaccharolyticum KKU19 from producing hydrogen via the SSF process. The highest methane yield and TEY were obtained from the auto-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment of both Napier grass and silage. Therefore, the organosolv pretreatment was more satisfactory for SSF hydrogen and methane production than the hydrothermal pretreatment because of its low lignin content in the pretreated materials. However, further investigation into the economic feasibility of the pretreatment method, mass balance, and energy balance are needed to evaluate the economic performance of this method."
