0,Introduction,"The rising demand for energy, in addition to the unsustainability of fossil fuels and environmental issues, has led to increasing interest in the biomass utilization. The bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising alternative to petroleum crude for fuels, chemicals, and materials production [1]. According to the study by Polin et al. [2], which was based on biomass input energy, the energy yields of bio-oil, biochar, and non-condensable gases from the fast pyrolysis of red oak were 68%, 19.4%, and 6.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, commercial production of bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of forest and agricultural residues was realized in Ensyn of Canada, which has been providing Youngstown Thermal with up to 2.5 million gallons of bio-oil per year since 2015 [3]. Similarly, a few demonstration projects of biomass or waste tyre pyrolysis in the range 1,000–10,000 tons a year are under construction in China. However, certain undesirable properties of crude bio-oil, such as high oxygen content, high viscosity, strong corrosiveness, and low heating value, limit its utilization as transportation fuels [4,5]. Catalytic upgrading of crude bio-oil is usually required if drop-in biofuel is the target product [6]. Over the past few decades, various upgrading technologies have been developed, including catalytic cracking, catalytic hydrogenation, catalytic esterification, and catalytic reforming [7–10]. Currently, catalytic cracking using zeolite-type catalysts can convert oxygenated bio-oil to aromatic hydrocarbons [7,11]. Bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass (e.g., walnut shell, cotton stalk, etc.) is rich in phenolics with low reactivity, such as phenolic monomers and oligomers, which tend to form coke causing rapid catalyst deactivation during catalytic cracking [12,13]. Therefore, molecular distillation of bio-oil is usually employed, through which acids and ketones are concentrated in the distilled fraction, while phenolic oligomers and sugars remain in the residual fraction [14]. The distilled fraction is then used as the feedstock for catalytic cracking. However, phenolic monomers remain in the distilled fraction, resulting in a relatively low (H/C)eff ((H − 2O)/C) of the feedstock. In catalytic cracking, deoxygenation of the distilled fraction generates various intermediates with higher (H/C)eff, such as olefins, accompanied by the formation of coke with a lower (H/C)eff. Therefore, decreasing conversion was observed in the long-run [15]. A previous study [16] on the hydrogenation–cracking of bio-oil model compounds have revealed that mild prehydrogenation has the potential to improve the overall conversion and reduce the coke formation in catalytic cracking by increasing the (H/C)eff. In the mild hydrogenation of phenolics, the predominant reaction is the selective hydrogenation of the aromatic rings to form aliphatic derivatives. The development of catalysts is crucial in this reaction. Many types of catalysts, including noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, and Ru) and base metals (e.g., Ni and Cu), have been investigated for such catalytic hydrogenation [17], among which, platinum (Pt) exhibits high catalytic activity, because the phenoxy species are known to be strongly adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) through the aromatic rings [18]. Furthermore, Mortensen et al. [19] reported that the rate of hydrogenation over Pt/C was ~1 order of magnitude higher than that over Ru/C or Pd/C during phenol hydrogenation. Similarly, Ni/SiO2 was also observed to exhibit a high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation as well as hydrogenolysis of various phenolic monomers, achieving a phenolic conversion in the range of 80%−99% [8]. However, compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher catalytic activity, stability, and product selectivity [20]. Therefore, Pt–Ni catalysts have been widely used in the hydrogenation of various bio-oil model compounds [21,22]. Recently, Chen et al. [23] reported that with a high Ni loading, the hydrogenolysis of the products obtained from phenolic hydrogenation generated considerable amounts of gaseous products at high temperatures, thereby reducing the selectivity of the hydrogenation products; this is due to the high hydrogenolysis activity of Ni. Therefore, the ratio of Ni/Pt must be adjusted to avoid such side reactions leading to gas formation and ensure efficient hydrogenation. In this study, mild hydrogenation of three typical phenolic monomers (phenol, catechol, and guaiacol) in the distilled fraction of bio-oil over a series of SiO2-supported Pt–Ni bimetallic catalysts at different Ni/Pt ratios was performed to evaluate their catalytic and stability performance. Furthermore, the catalytic cracking behavior of the hydrotreated bio-oil was investigated to validate the proposed conversion pathway."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Pt–Ni bimetallic catalysts used for mild hydrogenation were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. Tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate (Pt(NO3)2(NH3)4) and nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) were used as the precursors of Pt and Ni, respectively. For Pt/SiO2 and Pt–Ni/SiO2, the Pt and Ni loadings were 3 wt% and 0–9 wt%, respectively; the ratio of Ni/Pt was adjusted to avoid the hydrogenolysis of the hydrogenation products and to ensure efficient hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of 3Pt9Ni/SiO2 and 12Ni/SiO2 were compared at a total metal loading of 12 wt% to investigate the effect of replacing Pt with Ni. The following procedure was used to prepare the Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalysts: desired amounts of Pt(NO3)2(NH3)4 and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were simultaneously added to deionized water. After sufficient mixing, the calcined SiO2 was mixed with the obtained solution, followed by stabilization for 12 h. Finally, the mixture was dried in an oven at 110 °C overnight, and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. The preparation procedures for Pt/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 are the same as that of Pt–Ni/SiO2, except for the chemical reagents used. As shown in Table 1 , the obtained Pt and Ni contents determined by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) are very close to the desired ones, and there is no obvious catalyst leaching after the hydrogenation reaction. The Ga2O3/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) used for subsequent catalytic cracking was also prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method according to reference [11], while the Ga2O3 loading was 15 wt%. The catalysts were pressed, milled, and sieved to 40–60 mesh before the experiment."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area and pore volume of the Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption using an automated surface area and pore size analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA) over the angular range of 10°−90°. Prior to the experiment, all catalysts were reduced at 500 °C for 3 h under H2 at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The crystallite size of the catalyst was calculated using the Scherrer equation and the Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) diffraction peak: L = K λ β c o s θ where K is the half-width Scherrer constant (K = 0.89), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray (λ = 0.154056 nm), β is the full width at half maximum intensity (rad), and θ is the Bragg angle (rad). Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed on an AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics) instrument. The catalysts were pretreated with He at 250 °C for 1 h and then cooled to ambient temperature. The reduction was carried out using a mixture of 10% H2/He at a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 800 °C. The coke content of the spent 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 catalyst was obtained using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG, TA Q500). Under an air flow of 30 mL/min, the experiments were performed from ambient temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min."
4,Catalytic experiment,"2.3 Catalytic experiment Phenol (Sinopharm Chemical), guaiacol (Alfa Aesar), and catechol (Sinopharm Chemical) were used as model compounds for the distilled fraction of bio-oil, using ethanol (Sinopharm Chemical) as the solvent: phenol is the simplest and most common phenolic monomer in the distilled fraction of bio-oil [24]; catechol, with its two adjacent Caryl–OH groups on the aromatic ring, is an important product of lignin pyrolysis and an intermediate in the conversion of syringol or guaiacol [25,26]; guaiacol is the most representative phenolic monomer, because it incorporates two types of C–O bonds (Caryl–OH and Caryl–OCH3) that are typical for both lignin and its derivatives. The compositions of the feedstock were 20 wt% phenol (catechol or guaiacol) and 80 wt% ethanol for the hydrogenation of the phenolic monomers, and 12 wt% phenol, 12 wt% guaiacol, 1 wt% catechol, and 75 wt% ethanol for the stability of the catalyst. The ratio of the three phenolics was determined according to their content in the distilled fraction of the bio-oil produced by the pyrolysis of the walnut shell [27]. Subsequently, the abovementioned distilled fraction of bio-oil was used for the hydrogenation and cracking tests. The ratio between the distilled fraction and ethanol was 1:1 both in the single-stage cracking and hydrogenation–cracking processes. The catalytic reactions were carried out in a two-stage stainless steel fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 1 ), with an inner diameter of 8 mm. In a typical experiment, Pt–Ni/SiO2 and Ga2O3/HZSM-5 (2 g each) were supported by quartz wool in the hydrogenation and cracking reactors, respectively. Prior to the reaction, Pt–Ni/SiO2 was reduced at 500 °C for 3 h under H2 with a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The reactants were pumped using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump, and were then nebulized with H2 at a flow rate of 30 mL/min and fed into the reactor. The outlet gas was cooled through the condenser and then separated into liquid products and non-condensable gases. According to our previous studies [9,11,23], the reaction temperatures of hydrogenation and cracking processes were set at 270 °C and 400 °C, respectively, while the reaction pressure was kept at 4 MPa to achieve a balance between the catalytic performance and operation cost. Furthermore, Sanna et al. [28] reported that Pt/C exhibited a high hydrogenation activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3 h−1. Pt-WO x /C was observed to be unusually active in the hydrodeoxygenation of m-cresol (2 mol%) at a WHSV of 0.6 h−1 [29]. Complete deoxygenation of eugenol of 10 wt% was achieved over Pt/Al2O3-ZSM-5 at a WHSV of 2.5 h−1 [30]. The concentration of the phenolic monomers with low reactivity is as high as 20–25 wt% in this study. Then, WHSV was set at 1 h−1."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The gaseous products were quantified using an online gas chromatograph (GC, Huaai GC 9560), and the liquid products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer system (GC–MS, TraceDSQ II) using a DB-WAX polar column. Furthermore, a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) was employed not only to quantify the unconverted reactants and liquid products by the external standard method, but also to calculate reactant conversion and product yield, using an INNOWAX capillary column. A detailed description of the product analysis can be found in our previous study [16]. Conversions of reactants (Xi ) and yields of liquid products (Y) are defined by Eqs. (1) and (2), in which the symbol mi in the equation represents the mass of corresponding substances. (1) X i = ( m i ) in - ( m i ) out ( m i ) in × 100 % (2) Y = m liquid products ( m liquid reactants ) in × 100 %"
6,Result and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The fresh and spent Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalysts for mild hydrogenation were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, TG, and BET measurements, while the characterization of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 for catalytic cracking can be found in our previous study [11]. 3.1.1 XRD The XRD patterns of the reduced Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 (a): For all catalysts, a broad peak of amorphous SiO2 was detected at 2θ = 26.6°, as expected. Furthermore, Pt/SiO2 exhibited five diffraction peaks, at 2θ = 39.8°, 46.2°, 67.5°, 81.2°, and 85.7°, which were indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2) planes of the Pt species, while the three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° were assigned to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of the Ni crystallites on the Ni/SiO2, respectively. For Pt–Ni/SiO2, some characteristic peaks of Pt were observed to weaken and even disappear with the introduction of Ni, indicating that Ni promoted the dispersion of Pt on SiO2. A similar tendency was also observed for NiCo/γ-Al2O3 and Ni–Fe/MCS (mesoporous carbon spheres) [31,32]. Using the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of 3Pt/SiO2, 3Pt3Ni/SiO2, 3Pt6Ni/SiO2, 3Pt9Ni/SiO2, and 12Ni/SiO2 were determined to be 18.8 nm, 3.9 nm, 4.5 nm, 6.6 nm, and 15.3 nm, respectively; this indicates that a high Ni loading caused the local aggregation of the Ni particles. Notably, as the Ni content increased from 3 wt% to 6 wt% and then to 9 wt%, the peaks for Ni (1 1 1) shifted from 43.0° to 43.9° and 44.2°, respectively. The increase in the 2θ values could be due to the alloying of the involved metals [33]. Similarly, a high content (73%–82%) of the Pt–Ni bond was also observed over Pt–Ni/Al2O3 by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, which further confirms the formation of the Pt–Ni alloy. A few Pt atoms were replaced by Ni atoms with a smaller atomic radius, which contributed to the shift of 2θ to a higher angle [34]. The minor diffraction peaks of Pt and Ni species in the bimetallic catalysts result from a weak crystallization of the Pt and Ni species, indicating that the bimetallic particles were evenly dispersed. 3.1.2 H2-TPR As shown in H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 2 (b)), Pt/SiO2 exhibited almost no diffraction peak, indicating that Pt was in its reduced state. In contrast, a broad diffraction peak of Ni at 366 °C was observed over Ni/SiO2 [35]. The temperature of the Ni diffraction peak obviously shifted to a low-temperature zone over Pt–Ni/SiO2, while the amplitude of the movement increased with the decreasing proportion of Ni, suggesting that the addition of the Pt species significantly promoted the reduction of NiO, and a lower ratio of Ni/Pt contributed to the reduction of NiO at a lower temperature. This is because the dissociated H• radical species over Pt atoms were readily transferred to the adjacent inert Ni atoms, thereby promoting the reduction of NiO to the metallic state [36]."
8,Hydrogenation of phenolic monomers,"3.2 Hydrogenation of phenolic monomers 3.2.1 Conversion of reactants The conversion of the phenolic monomers in the hydrogenation is exhibited in Fig. 3 (a). The lowest phenol conversion of 58.0% was obtained over 3Pt/SiO2, owing to the relatively poor hydrogenation ability of the aromatic rings under the reaction conditions used in this study. However, with the addition of Ni, the conversion of phenol dramatically increased to 85.2%, 89.8%, and 89.2% over 3Pt3Ni/SiO2, 3Pt6Ni/SiO2, and 3Pt9Ni/SiO2, respectively. This could be because hydrogen transfer occurred readily over the Pt–Ni/SiO2 catalysts, as shown in the H2-TPR results. The superior activity of the Pt–Ni catalysts has previously been ascribed to the sufficient hydrogen supply, derived from the spontaneous dissociation of H2 and the rapid diffusion of the resulting H atoms on the catalysts [37]. Additionally, the Pt and Ni species in the Pt–Ni catalysts were highly dispersed as indicated by the XRD analysis, contributing to the superior performance over these bimetallic catalysts. Surprisingly, 12Ni/SiO2 exhibited the highest phenol conversion of 99.7%. A similar phenomenon was also reported in a study by Zhang et al. [8] on the aqueous hydrogenation of phenol. This is because the delocalized electron in the aromatic ring was accepted by the reduced Ni particles (Ni0), resulting in the activation of the aromatic ring. Therefore, a nucleophilic addition reaction occurred through the adsorbed H attacking the aromatic ring [38]. However, the yield of the liquid products over 12Ni/SiO2 was observed to be the lowest, which shall be discussed in the next section. In general, the conversion of catechol is satisfactory over various catalysts: Pt/SiO2 exhibited 93.1% conversion, while the other catalysts exceeded 95%. Antonetti et al. [39] observed a nearly complete conversion of catechol over a Ru-based catalyst; this is unexpected as the conversion of catechol was higher than that of phenol over Pt–Ni/SiO2. In fact, compared with the hydrogenation of phenol, the coke from the polycyclic aromatic compounds was more readily formed over the surface of the catalysts through condensation reactions during catechol hydrogenation [40]. The abovementioned conclusion is also confirmed by the TG analysis (discussed below). The conversion of guaiacol over 3Pt/SiO2 was as low as 25.1%, which significantly increased to 66.3% over 3Pt6Ni/SiO2. Therefore, the conversion of guaiacol was much lower than that of phenol or catechol. A previous study [26] reported that the turnover frequency of guaiacol was far lower than that of either phenol or catechol; this was ascribed to the electron donation of Caryl–OH, which could stabilize the carbocation transition state, thereby preventing the hydrolysis of Caryl–OCH3 to CH3OH. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that the steric hindrance of Caryl–OCH3 renders the coplanar adsorption of the aromatic ring difficult, while it is more pronounced than that of Caryl–OH. Therefore, lower reactivity of guaiacol was observed over Ni-based and Pd-based catalysts [26,41]. 3.2.2 Yield of liquid products The liquid product yield from phenolic monomer hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 3 (b). A yield of 92.0% from phenol hydrogenation was obtained over Pt/SiO2, which gradually decreased with increasing Ni content. Over Pt–Ni/SiO2, the liquid product yield was above 80%, while it was only 68.7% over 12Ni/SiO2, along with a significant increase in the gaseous product yield, including C1–4 alkanes and CO, suggesting multiple hydrogenolysis of the internal C–C bonds (resulting in ring opening). This can be explained as follows: Ni is an active metal for successive hydrogenolysis of the terminal C–C bonds, leading to a high yield of C1–4 alkanes. In contrast, Pt is the least active catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of the C–C bonds [42]. This is consistent with our observation that a higher Ni content resulted in lower liquid product and higher gaseous product yields at this reaction temperature. Furthermore, Cai et al. [43] reported that Ni promoted the gas formation in the hydrogenation reaction over Cu–Ni catalysts. The liquid product yield from catechol hydrogenation over Pt/SiO2 was 94.7%, while it ranged between 75% and 81% over Pt–Ni/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2. With increasing Ni content, the yield exhibited a trend similar to that of phenol hydrogenation. Besides, as mentioned above, conversion of catechol was generally higher than that of phenol over Pt–Ni/SiO2. However, the liquid product yield of catechol hydrogenation over Pt–Ni/SiO2 was slightly lower than that of phenol hydrogenation. This is attributed to the formation of many high molecular weight compounds (i.e., the precursor of coke) via polymerization during the catechol hydrogenation, as confirmed by the TG analysis (discussed below). Therefore, a part of the catechol was converted into undesired solid byproducts over Pt–Ni/SiO2 during the hydrogenation process. Similar to the hydrogenation of phenol and catechol, the liquid product yield of over 90% from guaiacol hydrogenation was obtained over 3Pt/SiO2, which gradually decreased with increasing Ni content. Furthermore, the yields ranged from 72% to 81% over Pt–Ni/SiO2. The liquid product yield from guaiacol hydrogenation was observed to be slightly lower than that from either phenol or catechol. This is because guaiacol exhibited a relatively lower reactivity and therefore, tended to undergo thermal condensation to produce coke (Fig. 5 (b)). Furthermore, the activation barrier of its demethylation is relatively low (159–183 kJ/mol) [44], which occurred to form gaseous hydrocarbons such as CH4, resulting in the decline of the liquid product yield. 3.2.3 Distribution of hydrogenation products Table 2 lists the major liquid products obtained from phenol hydrogenation. Only a small amount of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol were detected among the liquid products over 3Pt/SiO2, indicating an insufficient hydrogenation of the aromatic ring under the applied reaction conditions; besides, the deoxygenation of the products was not observed. With the addition of Ni, more cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, and even cyclohexane were detected among the liquid products, indicating that the presence of Ni considerably promoted not only the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and the C=O bond, but also the hydrogenolysis of the alkyl C–O bond. Furthermore, 12Ni/SiO2 was observed to exhibit the low cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, and cyclohexane concentrations. This is because although 12Ni/SiO2 promoted further transformation of cyclohexanone into cyclohexanol and cyclohexane, the hydrogenolysis of the C–C bond was also enhanced simultaneously, leading to the opening of the cyclohexanol and cyclohexane rings to produce a large number of gaseous hydrocarbons. Therefore, the content of Ni must be set within an appropriate range, such that the hydrogenation performance and the inhibition of the gas formation are balanced. Based on the above results, a possible reaction pathway for the hydrogenation of phenol has been proposed (Scheme 1 a). Overall, the reaction pathway for the conversion of phenol under the current conditions mainly involved three steps: The first step was the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone via keto–enol isomerization [41] or tautomerization [45]. However, the intermediate (i.e., cyclohexenol or 2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one) was not detected by the GC–MS in this study. This may be due to the faster hydrogenation of the intermediate than its formation over Pt–Ni/SiO2. The second step was further hydrogenation of cyclohexanone to produce cyclohexanol [26,46]. The first two steps required the catalytic effect of Pt and Ni on the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and the C=O bond. The final step was the deoxygenation of cyclohexanol to produce cyclohexane by the hydrogenolysis of the C–O bond. The weak acidic OH sites located on the surface of SiO2 favored the adsorption of O atoms in the –OH or –OCH3 groups [47], and then the Ni sites mediated the hydrogenolysis of the C–O bond. The major compounds in the liquid products obtained from catechol hydrogenation are shown in Table 3 . Similar to the hydrogenation of phenol, the introduction of Ni also plays an important role in the hydrogenation of catechol. Over Pt/SiO2, more initial hydrogenation liquid products (i.e., phenol and 2-hydroxycyclohexanone) were observed, indicating the insufficient hydrogenation of catechol. Reasonably, more highly saturated cyclic alcohols were detected among the liquid products resulting from the catalyst, with increasing Ni content. The reaction pathway for catechol hydrogenation over Pt–Ni/SiO2 could be classified into two types (Scheme 1 b): (1) hydrogenolysis of Caryl–OH and hydrogenation of the generated phenol, (2) hydrogenation of the aromatic ring and keto–enol isomerization to form 2-hydroxycyclohexanone, followed by the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (and keto–enol isomerization) to produce cyclohexanol. At the first stage, two types of reactions occurred in parallel. The former pathway, which was less favored, resulted in trace amounts of phenol among the liquid products. This is because the bond energy of Caryl–OH (468 kJ/mol) is much higher than that of Calkyl–OH (385 kJ/mol) [48]. Note that benzene (i.e., hydrogenolysis of the Caryl–O bond) was not observed during phenol hydrogenation, indicating that the bond strength of Caryl–OH in catechol is weaker than that in phenol. This is attributed to the electron donation from the second –OH substituent or the steric hindrance of the adjacent –OH group in catechol [41]. In contrast, the latter pathway dominated, leaving a significant amount of unconverted cyclohexanediol among liquid products. This indicates that the cyclohexanediol conversion rate was much lower than that of catechol, which is due to both steric and electronic effects. The adsorption capacity of the aromatic molecules is significantly promoted by the highly delocalized π orbitals [49], compared with their saturated analogues with less regular chair conformation and sp3 orbitals. The major liquid products obtained from guaiacol hydrogenation are listed in Table 4 . Similar to the conversion of phenol and catechol, the following major products were formed through the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring: Cyclohexanol was the dominant product, with some intermediates, namely phenol and (methyl) cyclohexanediol. 3Pt/SiO2 and 3Pt3Ni/SiO2 exhibited a higher content of undesired phenol among the liquid products, indicating the poor hydrogenation activity of these two catalysts. In contrast, the presence of Ni promoted the formation of highly hydrogenated products (cyclohexanol and cyclohexane), and was also beneficial for the removal and transfer of the methyl groups, leading to the formation of the cyclic alcohol derivatives through a transalkylation reaction. Typically, transalkylation was reported to occur on acidic zeolites [50], which could be catalyzed by small amounts of the unreduced Ni cations acting as Lewis acid sites [42]. This reduced the loss of carbon, and therefore, there was no significant decline in the liquid product yield over 12Ni/SiO2. Furthermore, small amounts of diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane, and ethyl phenyl ether were also detected among the liquid products, indicating that the competing side reaction—i.e., etherification—inevitably occurred. Based on the quantification of the products, the formation of cyclohexanol mainly included two parallel routes (Scheme 1 c): (1) hydrogenation and keto–enol isomerization of guaiacol to 2-methoxycyclohexanone, followed by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis to cyclohexanone and further hydrogenation, and (2) direct demethoxylation of guaiacol and hydrogenation of the generated phenol [25]. Similar to the conversion of catechol, the hydrogenation rate was faster than that of hydrogenolysis for the conversion of guaiacol, resulting from the steric effect of the sp3 hybrid Caryl–OCH3 orbital. The hydrogenolysis of the Caryl–O bond took place during the hydrogenation of catechol and guaiacol instead of phenol. This is because the steric constraint from the second –OH or –OCH3 group in catechol and guaiacol preferentially resulted in a nonplanar adsorption mode [41]. Therefore, hydrogenolysis is more likely to occur during the hydrogenation of catechol and guaiacol. In addition to the abovementioned two routes, another less-favored route is the direct cleavage of Caryl–OH and hydrogenation of anisole to cyclohexanol, which is supported by the negligible content of anisole detected in the liquid products. As explained earlier, this is because of the considerably high bond energy of Caryl–OH. 3.2.4 Stability of the catalyst Based on the yield and composition of the liquid products, 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 and 3Pt9Ni/SiO2 exhibited superior catalytic performance in hydrogenation, leading to significant yields of the highly saturated products. However, compared with 3Pt9Ni/SiO2, the lower Ni loading in 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 is beneficial for reducing the amount of loaded metal. Besides, reduction of NiO is more likely to occur in 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 than in 3Pt9Ni/SiO2, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Accordingly, the 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 catalyst was selected as the optimal catalyst for the stability test of the hydrogenation of phenolic mixtures. As shown in Fig. 4 , 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 exhibited high stability during the hydrogenation of the phenolic mixtures: An almost 100% conversion of catechol and ~80% conversion of phenol were achieved, while that of guaiacol ranged between 71% and 83% over the test period. The fluctuation in the conversion of the phenolic monomers was observed in long-run. The reactivity of the catalyst fluctuated throughout the period, especially during the initial stage. Besides, a small amount of liquid products might remain in the pipeline of the fixed-bed reactor after each sampling. Even after 24 h, the conversion of the phenolic reactants remained above 80%, which is a satisfactory result for the hydrogenation of the phenolic mixtures. Furthermore, the spent 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 had a large surface area and pore volume (Table 5 ), suggesting controlled coke formation as well as catalyst deactivation. This could be because SiO2 is an inert material with negligible acid sites, while it is common knowledge that the formation of aromatic coke is promoted by acidic sites [51]. The XRD patterns of the fresh and spent 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 catalysts are compared in Fig. 5 (a). The new characteristic peaks of the Pt and Ni species observed after the reaction indicate their local aggregation on the surface of SiO2. Furthermore, low diffraction peaks were observed after phenol hydrogenation, indicating that the active species were still amorphous. For the 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 after catechol hydrogenation, the intensity of the diffraction peaks is slightly higher than that after phenol hydrogenation, while stronger and sharper diffraction peaks were observed after guaiacol hydrogenation, implying more ordered and crystallized Pt and Ni species. These results indicate that the trend of the diffraction peak intensities is correlated with the reactivity of the three phenolic monomers after the hydrogenation reaction. The polymerization of the phenolic intermediates results in coke formation on the surface of the catalysts, which accounts for their deactivation during the hydrogenation reaction [51]. The results of the TG analysis performed on the spent 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 5 (b)) show that the coke formed during phenol hydrogenation accounted for only 0.11 g per gram of catalyst; this was slightly higher, i.e., 0.15 g/g, during catechol hydrogenation. Although catechol conversion was remarkably higher than that of phenol, the liquid product yield from the former was slightly lower than that from the latter, indicating that more phenolic intermediates participated in the coke formation during catechol hydrogenation. In contrast, there was an obvious weight loss of the spent 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 after guaiacol hydrogenation and a high coke yield of 0.26 g/g, leading to a lower liquid product yield. However, for the hydrogenation of the phenolic mixtures, the moderate coke yield of 0.17 g/g indicates that 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 could significantly suppress the coke formation. As shown in Table 5, we observed a slight decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst after the reaction. This could be due to coke deposition, which could block some pores of the catalyst. The following order of surface area and pore volume corresponding to different reactants was observed: phenol > catechol > guaiacol. The results of the TG and BET analyses show that with increasing coke formation on the catalyst surface, there is a more obvious decline in the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst."
9,Hydrogenation–cracking of the distilled fraction of bio-oil,"3.3 Hydrogenation–cracking of the distilled fraction of bio-oil The distilled fraction of the bio-oil was further used as the feedstock to investigate the effect of mild hydrogenation on the production of aromatic hydrocarbons via catalytic cracking. The above optimized 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 was used for mild hydrogenation, while Ga2O3/HZSM-5, which was optimized in our previous study [52], was used for the subsequent catalytic cracking. The results in Fig. 6 indicate that compared to crude bio-oil, many large molecules, such as isoeugenol, vanillin, and levoglucosan, were not detected among the distilled fraction. Furthermore, the content of phenolics—mainly including alkylated phenols and guaiacols, which were still the major components in the distilled fraction—significantly decreased from 53.8% to 41.6%. In addition, the content of ethers, esters, acids, furans, and alcohols were also enriched in the distilled fraction. The products of single-stage cracking and hydrogenation–cracking of the distilled fraction were compared to determine the effect of mild hydrogenation on the cracking reaction. Fig. 7 shows the product yields in the single-stage cracking and hydrogenation–cracking reactions: the yield of the oil phase was only 24.6% from the former reaction, while the mild hydrogenation prior to catalytic cracking was observed to increase the yield to 38.6%. Thus, we conclude that the mild prehydrogenation is beneficial for the formation of the oil phase. Ethylene, which is an intermediate formed by the deoxygenation of the oxygenated reactants [11], is an important index in the cracking reaction, and therefore, it has been listed separately. The ethylene yield from hydrogenation–cracking (0.8%) was significantly lower than that from the single-stage cracking (4.9%). Generally, the oxygenates in the distilled fraction of bio-oil are believed to first undergo deoxygenation (dehydration, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation) to produce light olefin intermediates, such as C2H4, followed by further aromatization to produce aromatic hydrocarbons [11]. However, owing to a relatively low (H/C)eff of the distilled fraction, the high molecular weight oligomers were readily formed on the surface of the catalyst during the deoxygenation reaction, which resulted in catalyst deactivation, thereby inhibiting the subsequent aromatization of the light olefins. In contrast, the (H/C)eff of the distilled fraction could be remarkably improved via mild hydrogenation, which effectively inhibited the coke formation [16]. Thus, the aromatization activity of the catalyst was well maintained, which is consistent with the higher yields of the oil phase and the aromatic hydrocarbons (discussed below) from hydrogenation–cracking. The GC–MS total ion chromatogram of the oil phase from hydrogenation–cracking is also shown in Fig. 6. The family compounds in the oil phase have been classified and summarized in Table 6 . For single-stage cracking, the hydrocarbon content was more than 99% in the oil phase, while that of the aromatic hydrocarbons was up to 97.2%. However, a high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) content of about 22.5% was observed, which is not beneficial for its subsequent storage, transportation, and combustion. In contrast, for hydrogenation–cracking, the oil phase was composed solely of hydrocarbons—with 97.4% aromatic and 2.6% aliphatic hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) with content as high as 82.2% included benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), while the content of PAHs, which included naphthalene and its derivatives, was only 15.2%. This indicates that the introduction of hydrogen promoted the conversion of the distilled fraction into MAHs. Furthermore, the BTX content obtained from hydrogenation–cracking (63.7%) was remarkably higher in the oil phase than that from single-stage cracking (51.9%), indicating an improved oil phase quality after the mild hydrogenation. The liquid product appears as a clearly separated oil phase and aqueous phase, as shown in Fig. 7. The oil phase is light yellow, similar to commercial gasoline, while the aqueous phase is transparent. The elemental analysis of the oil phase shows that the oxygen content from single-stage cracking was 1.06%, while oxygen was not detected from the hydrogenation–cracking. This indicates 100% hydrocarbon content in the oil phase, which is in accordance with the results of the GC–MS."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, we reported the mild hydrogenation of phenolics, i.e., phenol, catechol, and guaiacol, over Pt–Ni/SiO2 at different Ni/Pt ratios. The hydrogenation of aromatic rings mainly occurred over Pt–Ni/SiO2, while the hydrogenolysis of the Caryl–OR bond also occurred in the hydrogenation of catechol and guaiacol. Furthermore, the effect of the different Ni/Pt ratios on the mild hydrogenation of phenolics over Pt–Ni/SiO2 was studied: an increase in the Ni content was observed to simultaneously promote the conversion of phenolics and the side reaction leading to gas formation. The 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the best performance in achieving high phenolic conversion in the range of 66%–99% with a high liquid product yield of 80%, while the side reaction resulting in gas formation was greatly inhibited. Moreover, a stable phenolic conversion of ~80% was maintained within 24 h, indicating a superior stability of 3Pt6Ni/SiO2 for the hydrogenation of phenolics. The feasibility of the upgrading strategy of hydrogenation–cracking for bio-oil was proven in this study. The yield and quality of the oil phase from the hydrogenation–cracking of the distilled fraction of bio-oil were obviously improved. The oil phase yield of the bio-oil fraction was 38.6%, which consisted entirely of hydrocarbons, of which 82.2% were monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Various oxygenated compounds in bio-oil, including phenolics, acids, and ketones, can be efficiently converted into aromatic hydrocarbons via hydrogenation–cracking. These renewable hydrocarbons have potential to be used as additives for transportation fuels."
