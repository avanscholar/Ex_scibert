0,Introduction,"Lithium ion batteries are extensively applied in portable electronic instruments, electric vehicles, and energy storage stations [1]. The energy density of lithium ion batteries is extremely imperative to improve for satisfying the demand of these fields [2]. Among the reported anode materials, silicon (Si) has been regarded as an optimal candidate for the improvement of energy density, because of its high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g−1), low operation voltage (0.2 V-0.3 V vs. Li+/Li), and abundant reserves [3]. Nevertheless, the alloy reaction mechanism of Si destructs its crystal structure to produce huge volume expansion (> 300%), which causes the pulverization and crack of Si particles, the delamination of electrode materials, the continuous production of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films, and the separation between electrode materials and current collectors [4,5]. These disadvantages deteriorate the electrochemical performance and thus severely impede the commercial application of Si anodes. At present, significant breakthroughs have been achieved via reducing the particle size of Si [6,7], compositing with other functional matrixes [8–11], producing porous or hollow structures [12–14], and optimizing the electrolyte additives [15], the conductive additives and the binders [16]. Among these strategies, binder optimization is considered as an effective method to overcome the above-mentioned problems, because active materials and conductive additives are adhered together on current collectors by polymeric binders to maintain the electrode integrity. Traditional PVDF with weak van der Waals forces cannot withstand the huge volume variation during discharge and charge processes. Therefore, numerous binders have been designed and fabricated for accommodating the huge volume variation stress. At present, poly(furfuryl alcohol)-polyvinyl alcohol (PFA-PVA) [17], polyvinyl pyrrolidone-polyaniline (PVP-PANI) [18], polyethylene oxide-polyethylenimine-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEO-PEI-PEDOT-PSS) [19], chitosan-glutaraldehyde (CS-GA) [20], Glycinamide modified polyacrylic acid (PAA-GA) [21], guar gum-boronic acid (GG-BC) [22], poly(N-methacryloyl-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) (PMDOPA) [23], chitosan-polyaniline (CS-PANI) [24], sodium carboxymethyl cellulose-polyacrylic acid (CMC-PAA) [25], transition metal cations bridged alginate (Alg-M) [26], and carboxymethyl cellulose-polyethylene glycol (CMC-PEG) [27] are developed to enhance the electrochemical properties of Si-based materials resulting from their strong mechanical properties and ion and electron conductivity. In addition, recently, self-healing polymers, such as polyacrylic acid-polyurethane (PAA-PU) [28], poly(ether-thioureas) (PET) [29], citric acid-poly (acrylic acid) (CA-PAA) [30], and glycol chitosan-oxidized alginate (GCS-OSA) [31], have been investigated as binders for Si-based materials, which can accommodate the volume change and improve the cycling stability. The above-mentioned reports and the current researches mainly focus on the special performance of polymeric binders, but the adhesive forces of polymeric binders with Si particles and copper (Cu) foils are crucial factors to sustain the electrode structure. Many pioneering works demonstrate the generation of hydrogen bonds of polymeric binders with SiOx layers on Si surface [32]. Thiourea-based polymers are extensively investigated as self-healing materials due to its dense hydrogen bonds [33–35]. Therefore, developing multiple hydrogen bonding thiourea-based polymeric binders is beneficial to the improvement of the bulk properties and the adhesive ability with Si active materials. Importantly, the adhesion property between polymeric binders and Cu foils plays a critical role in avoiding the separation of electrode materials from current collectors, which would hinder the electron transmission and deteriorate the cycling performance during repeated swelling and shrinking processes [36]. Many strategies have been reported to increase the physical contact areas and the chemical bonds for the improvement of adhesive ability between polymeric binders and Cu foils. For examples, Reyter et al. prepared three-dimensional networked Cu nanowires on Cu foils via electrochemical surface pre-treatment, which increased their interfacial contact area and improve the adhesion of Si-based materials with Cu current collectors [37]. Cho et al. fabricated polydopamine coated Cu foils to enhance their adhesive forces with Si-based electrode materials resulting from the formation of cross-linked actions between polymeric binders and polydopamine [36]. Shang et al. constructed all-carbon graphdiyne coated Si nanoparticles on Cu nanowires, which could improve the interfacial contact among the components of the electrode and accommodate the volume change of Si active materials [38]. However, these methods possess the complicated pretreated processes, the avoidance of electron transportation, and the high cost, respectively. Thus, a facile and effective strategy needs to be developed to enhance the adhesive forces of polymeric binders with current collectors. In our previous study, the physical interlocked layers were successfully constructed at the interface between polymeric binders and current collectors, but the formation mechanisms and influence factors were insufficient for the optimization of polymeric binders [39]. In this work, the preparation of the polymeric binders (CMC/TU) was carried out through the copolymerization reaction between carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) and thiourea (TU). The obtained CMC/TU binders possess the bifunctional role through the CuxS physical interlocked layers and hydrogen bonds with Cu foils and Si particles, respectively. The heat-treatment temperature and time were optimized to obtain the suitable CuxS layers between CMC/TU binders and Cu current collectors. The generation of CuxS were verified through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry measurements. When served as binders to micro (1–5 μm) (MSi) Si powders, they exhibited high initial coulomb efficiency (89.9%) and good cycle life (1059 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles). This work provides an effective strategy for the enhancement of binding forces of electrode materials with current collectors through the construction of the physical interlocked layers at the interface between polymeric binders and current collectors."

Then the CMC-TU solution was poured into PTFE mould and dried at 40 °C for 10 h to produce CMC-TU-F. CMC-TU-F films were heat-treated at 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C in vacuum for 2 h to obtain CMC/TU100, CMC/TU120, and CMC/TU140 films, respectively.

In addition, the CMC-TU-Cu were heat-treated at 120 °C in vacuum for 1 and 3 h to prepare CMC/TU/C120–1 and CMC/TU/C120–3. CMC/C120 was prepared using the same process with CMC/TU/C120. The thickness of binder films on Cu foils was about 2 μm."
5,Preparation of Si-based electrode disks,"2.4 Preparation of Si-based electrode disks The Si electrode disks were prepared by dispersing MSi, carbon nanofiber, and polymer binders of CMC and TU with a mol ratio of 1:1 in deionized water and ethanol solution. The electrode disks were dried at 40 °C in air for 10 h, cut as 12 mm disks, and then further heat-treated at 100 °C for 2 h, 120 °C for 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h, 140 °C for 2 h in vacuum, respectively. The as-synthesized electrode disks were denoted as MSi/CMC/TU100–2, MSi/CMC/TU120–1, MSi/CMC/TU120–2, MSi/CMC/TU120–3, and MSi/CMC/TU140–2 electrodes. In addition, the Si electrode disks with different mol ratios of CMC and TU (0.5:1 and 2:1) were fabricated and denoted as MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (0.5:1) and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (2:1). The MSi/CMC120–2 electrode disk was prepared using the same method with MSi/CMC/TU120–2. The mass loading of MSi/CMC/TUs was about 0.8–1.0 mg cm−2. Besides, the Si electrode disks with higher mass loading (1.2–1.4 and 1.6–1.8 mg cm−2) of Si active materials were fabricated and denoted as MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (1.2–1.4) and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (1.6–1.8)."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out via Nicolet 330 spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were tested through PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD instrument using the Kα radiation of Cu (λ = 1.5418 Å). The tensile and peeling propertieswere measured via the universal tension machine with the size of 1 × 4 cm and the stretch speed of 5 mm min−1. The microscopic morphology was detected by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-7001F, Japan) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The interface elemental information was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument (PHI Quantum-2000). The CMC/TU/C120 disk was dipped in deionized water for 5 h to remove CMC/TU120 binders, washed with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C for 5 h. CMC/TU/C120-w disk was obtained and measured by XPS and XRD instruments. The cycled electrode disks were washed using dimethyl carbonate and dried for the XPS measurement."
7,Electrochemical measurement,"2.6 Electrochemical measurement CR2025 button batteries were fabricated in an argon-filled glove box using Si-based electrode disks as the working electrodes, lithium metals as the counter electrodes, Celgard 2400 films as membranes and LiPF6 (1 mol L−1) in ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (volume ratio, 1:1:1) with the additives of vinylene carbonate (2 wt%) and fluoroethylene carbonate (10 wt%) as liquid electrolyte. The initial discharge/charge curves, cyclic properties, and rate performance were tested using the LAND battery test system (Wuhan, China) between 0.01 and 1.2 V at different current densities. CHI660E electrochemical workstation was used to measure cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz at an ac oscillation of 5 mV."
8,Results and discussion,"FTIR spectra of CMC, TU, and CMC/TU prepared at different temperatures are tested and recorded in Fig. 1 a. The FTIR spectrum of CMC consist of the characteristic peaks of -OH, -CH2-, -COO−, C-O groups. For TU sample, there are characteristic double peaks (3270 and 3162 cm−1) of primary amine (-NH2) and the characteristic peaks of absorbed water (3378 cm−1) and N-C=S group. After the copolymerization, for CMC/TU100 sample, the peaks of TU can be seen obviously, indicating the incompletion reaction between CMC and TU. However, when the heat-treated temperatures increase to 120 and 140 °C, the characteristic double peaks of -NH2 within TU changes to the characteristic single peak (3204 cm−1) of secondary amine (-NH-) within CMC/TU120 and CMC/TU140, confirming the occurrence of the copolymerization [39,40]. FTIR spectra (Supporting Information, Figs. S1 and S2) of CMC and TU pretreated at 100, 120, 140 °C display the inexistence of new peaks, demonstrating their good thermal stability. To investigate the generation of hydrogen bonds between CMC/TU120 binders and Si active materials, FTIR spectrum of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks is tested and collected in Fig. S3. After mixing with Si particles, the shift of characteristic peaks of -OH, C-OH, -COO-, C-N groups demonstrates the formation of hydrogen bonds with Si surface [32]. Fig. 1b presents XRD patterns of CMC, TU, and CMC/TU prepared at different temperatures. There is a broad peak at 2θ value of ∼22° for CMC sample, demonstrating its amorphous structure. The crystalline peaks of TU sample can be observed obviously, suggesting its crystal structure. After copolymerization of CMC and TU, when the heat-treatment temperature is 100 °C, the XRD pattern of CMC/TU100 sample consists of amorphous CMC peaks and crystalline TU peaks, indicating the incomplete reaction between CMC and TU. However, when the heat-treated temperatures increase to 120 and 140 °C, a broad peak of CMC/TU120 and CMC/TU140 at 2θ value of ∼24° demonstrates their amorphous structure, indicating the complete reaction between CMC and TU. To show the mechanical properties of CMC120 and CMC/TU binders, the tensile test and the 180 ° peeling test are measured and recorded in Fig. 1c and d. The CMC120 film displays a high stiffness of 30 MPa and a low strain of 16%, which cannot suffer the huge volume change (>300%) during swelling and shrinking of Si active materials. After copolymerization of CMC with TU, CMC/TU films display better strain properties than that of CMC120 film resulting from multiple hydrogen bonds of thiourea-based polymer, as shown in Fig. 1c. The strain property of CMC/TU-120 can achieve ∼51%, indicating the optimal heat-treated temperature contributes to the reaction of CMC and TU and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds, which can accommodate huge volume variation during Si-Li alloying and dealloying processes. The presence of multiple hydrogen bonds of CMC/TU binders increases the physical crosslinking among polymer molecules, which can resist the deformation from the exogenic action and sustain the stable molecule structure. Many pioneering works demonstrate that the chemical and physical crosslinking from three-dimensional networked structure and hydrogen bonding forces contribute to the enhancement of strain properties [30,41–43]. Besides, the viscosity (Fig. S4) of CMC/TU120 solution increases fivefold as compared with that of CMC120 solution, further confirming the formation of more hydrogen bonds after copolymerization. Fig. S5 shows the photographic images of CMC120, CMC/TU100, CMC/TU120, and CMC/TU140 films with unfolded and bending states. After the heat-treatment at 100 and 120 °C, CMC/TU100 and CMC/TU120 exhibit white color, as compared with transparent color of CMC120, demonstrating the copolymerization reaction of CMC with TU. There are a small number of particles on CMC/TU100 film, demonstrating the incomplete reaction of TU with CMC. Besides, when the heat-treated temperature is 140 °C, the color of CMC/TU140 film changes to brownness, indicating the occurrence of adverse reaction. The peeling test (Fig. 1d) demonstrates that CMC/TU/Cs samples (1.5–3.1 N) possess the larger binding forces as compared with CMC/C120 (0.8 N), demonstrating that the CMC/TU films can tightly adhere to Cu current collectors. The CMC/TU/C120 sample possesses the highest peeling force (3.1 N), suggesting that the optimal temperature contributes to improve the binding forces of CMC/TU binders with Cu current collectors. To strengthen the binding forces of the rubber with the steel cord in the tire industry, the brass layer needs to be plated on the surface of the steel cord, otherwise the tire would burst resulting from the peeling of the rubber from the steel cord. Pioneering works have confirmed that the generation of the physical interlocked CuxS layers at the interface during vulcanization strengthen the binding forces between the rubber and the brass-coated steel cord [44,45]. The stronger peeling forces of CMC/TU binders from Cu foils as compared with CMC binders are probably because of the presence of the physical interlocked forces at the interface. The top-view SEM images and the corresponding Cu element mapping images of CMC/C120 and CMC/TU/Cs prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 a–h. Fig. 2a and b present that there are smooth surface morphology and no Cu element distribution for CMC/C120 sample. However, with the improvement of heat-treated temperature, the granulated anchors form and grow, as shown in Fig. 2c, e, and g. The corresponding Cu element mappings (Fig. 2d, f, and h) confirm that the granulated anchors mainly consist of Cu, demonstrating the presence of CuxS at the interface between polymeric binders and metallic current collectors. It can be seen from Fig. 2g and h that the granulated anchors grow up and penetrate the CMC/TU films, demonstrating that the high temperature contributes to the growth of CuxS and weakens the binding forces of CMC/TU binders with Cu foils (Fig. 1d). To investigate the binding properties of CMC/TU binders with Cu current collectors, their cross-view SEM images are measured and presented in Fig. 2i–l. The contact degree of CMC/TU binders with Cu current collectors is better than CMC/C120 because the TU groups within CMC/TU binders can react with Cu to form CuxS interlocked layers. The top-view and cross-view SEM images of CMC/TU/C120–1 and CMC/TU/C120–3 have been tested and recorded in Fig. S6. The CuxS content of CMC/TU/C120 heat-treated at 120 °C for 2 h (Fig. 2e) is higher than that of CMC/TU/C120–1 (Fig. S6a) and lower than that of CMC/TU/C120–3 (Fig. S6c), demonstrating that the longer heat-treated time contributes to the formation of more CuxS. In addition, the cross-view SEM images show that the closeness degree of CMC/TU/C120 (Fig. 2k) is better than that of CMC/TU/C120–1(Fig. S6b) and CMC/TU/C120–3 (Fig. S6d), suggesting that the optimal CuxS layers play a crucial role for the enhancement of binding forces between polymeric binders and current collectors. Among CMC/TU/Cs samples, CMC/TU/C120 exhibits the closer contact between CMC/TU120 binders and Cu current collectors, indicating that the optimal temperature contributes to the formation of suitable CuxS interlocked layers to strengthen the binding forces of binders with current collectors, which enhance the electrochemical properties of Si anodes. To further confirm the formation of CuxS between CMC/TU120 binders and Cu current collectors, CMC/TU/C120-w was obtained by dipping CMC/TU/C120 in deionized water to remove CMC/TU120 binders and measured by XPS instrument. XPS spectrum (Fig. 2m) of Cu 2p exhibits two main peaks at ∼952 and ∼932 eV corresponding to two asymmetric peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 for Cu-Cu and Cu-S or Cu-O [46]. The asymmetric peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of S 2p at ∼163 eV in Fig. 2n can be assigned to Cu-S compounds [47], which further confirm the formation of CuxS between CMC/TU120 polymers and Cu foils. Besides, the presence of the peak at ∼168 eV may result from the residual CMC/TU120 binders [39]. XRD pattern of CMC/TU/C120-w shows that the characteristic peak of CuxS cannot be seen obviously because of the strong diffraction peak of Cu metal, as shown in Fig. S7. Fig. 2o presents the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of CMC/C/120 and CMC/TU/C120 for the 1st cycle. These two samples exhibit the weak oxidation and reduction current peaks. But for CMC/TU-Cu-120 sample, excepting the reduction peak of fluoroethylene carbonate at ∼1.2 V, a reduction peak at 1.7 V and an oxidation peak at 1.9 V correspond to the lithiation and delithiation processes of CuxS, which confirms the formation of CuxS layers [48]. Fig. S8 shows the cycling properties of CMC/C120 and CMC/TU/C120. The capacities of CMC/C/120 and CMC/TU/C/120 are less than 10 mAh g−1, demonstrate that CMC and CMC/TU binders have almost no electrochemical activity. The interfacial mode of CMC/TU binders with Cu current collectors are displayed in Fig. 2p. The in-situ formation of CuxS layer at the interface generates the physical interlocked forces between CMC/TU binders and Cu current collectors, which contributes to avoid the separation of electrode materials with Cu current collectors for Si anodes. To investigate the effect of CMC/TU polymeric binders on the electrochemical properties of Si anodes, Si microparticles (MSi) (1–5 μm) (Fig. S9) are served as active materials to measure the electrochemical properties. Fig. 3 presents the cross-view SEM images of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 before and after 1st discharge and charge processes. The thickness of MSi/CMC120–2 electrode disk increases 390% from 22 μm (Fig. 3a) to 108 μm (Fig. 3b) after 1st lithiation process, higher than that of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (87%) from 23 μm (Fig. 3d) to 43 μm (Fig. 3e), indicating that three-dimensional network structure of CMC/TU can resist the huge volume change of Si active materials. After 1st delithiation process, the expansion rate of MSi/CMC120–2 electrode disk (37 μm, 68%) is higher than that of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (23 μm, 0%) (Fig. 3f), demonstrating that the high strain property of CMC/TU-120 contributes to sustain the electrode integrity during Si-Li alloying and dealloying processes. The peeling tests of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks before cycling were carried out and recorded in Fig. 3g. The peeling force of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (2.2 N) is higher than that of MSi/CMC120–2 (0.7 N) resulting from the high viscosity and strong interlock structure of CMC/TU polymers. The photographic images of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 after the peeling tests (inserted in Fig. 3g) present that most electrode materials are peeled from Cu foils. To prove the improvement in interparticle adhesion strength caused by the hydrogen bonding of active materials and binder, the cohesion strength data were tested through universal tension machine. CMC120 and CMC/TU120 films with the thickness of ∼2.0 mm were prepared and tailored as 1 × 4 cm. The upper and lower edges of CMC120 and CMC/TU120 films were clamped on the universal tension machine. The stretch speeds were controlled at 5 mm min−1 and the force-displacement plots were recorded in Fig. S10. For CMC120 and CMC/TU120 films, the cohesion forces are higher than adhesion forces, indicating that the enhancement of adhesion strength among Si particles mainly results from the hydrogen bonding forces between active materials and binders. In addition, the cohesion force and strain property of CMC120 are higher and weaker than that of CMC/TU120, respectively, resulting from the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds after copolymerization of CMC with TU. To investigate the effect of CMC and CMC/TU binders on SEI layers at electrode/electrolyte interface, XPS spectra of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks after 1st cycle at 210 mA g−1 were measured and recorded in Fig. 4 . As compared with MSi/TU/CMC120–2, there is a characteristic peak of Si at ∼99 eV (Fig. 4a) for MSi/CMC120–2, indicating that the inhomogeneous SEI layers on the surface of Si particles would lead to the contact of fresh Si with electrolyte and the continuous formation of SEI films [46]. For these two samples, the characteristic peak of Si-O at 102–104 eV can be seen obviously, demonstrating the less SEI films covered on Si surface after 1st cycle. The C 1 s spectra (Fig. 4b) of the cycled electrode disks presents that the peak intensity of polycarbonate and Li2CO3 of MSi/CMC120–2 are higher than that of MSi/CMC/TU120–2, indicating the three-dimensional networked structure of CMC/TU binders contributes to avoid the excessive SEI production and restrain the formation of Li2CO3, which would lead to the high initial irreversible capacity and poor cyclic stability [46]. The O 1 s spectra (Fig. S11a) of the cycled electrode disks also confirm that the excessive Li2CO3 is formed on MSi/CMC120–2 as compared with MSi/CMC/TU120–2. The F 1 s spectrum (Fig. S11b) of MSi/CMC120–2 is similar to that of MSi/CMC/TU120–2, demonstrating that CMC and CMC/TU binders have no influence on the formation of LiF. The S 2p and N 1 s spectra of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 can be observed obviously, demonstrating the good stability of polymeric binders within electrolyte. Nevertheless, the strong noise signals of S 2p and N 1 s spectra can be observed clearly, resulting from the low atomic ratio of S (0.76%) and N (1.21%), as shown in the full spectrum (Fig. S12) of the cycled MSi/TU/CMC120–2 electrode disks. The three-dimensional networked structure of CMC/TU binders can cover tightly on Si surface and generate suitable and robust SEI films, which can improve the 1st coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of Si anodes. Fig. 5 a shows the 1st discharge and charge curves of MSi/CMC120 and MSi/CMC/TUs prepared at different heat-treated temperatures and times at the current density of 210 mA g−1 and the cut-off voltage of 0.01–1.2 V. For all the samples, there are obvious lithiation and delithiation voltage plateau at 0.05 V-0.18 V and 0.25 V-0.60 V, respectively. The MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode possesses the highest initial coulombic efficiency (89.9%) comparing with other MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes (86.9%−88.8%), indicating that the optimal temperature (120 °C) and time (2 h) stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. The initial coulombic efficiencies of MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes are higher than that of MSi/CMC120–2 electrodes (85.5%). The capacity loss for the formation of SEI layers from open-circuit voltage to 0.5 V are 34 mAh g−1 for MSi/CMC/TU120–2 and 88 mAh g−1 for MSi/CMC120–2, demonstrating that the multiple hydrogen bonding of CMC/TU binders contributes to enhance their bonding forces with Si surface and thus stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Fig. 5b shows the CV curves of MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes tested at a scanning rate of 0.2 mV s−1 for the 1st cycle between 0.01V and 3.0 V. The cathodic peaks at 0.16 V and 0.04 V and anodic peaks at 0.34 V and 0.52 V are assigned to the lithiation and delithiation processes, respectively. Besides, a cathodic peak at ∼1.2 V corresponds to the reduction of fluoroethylene carbonate additives within electrolyte. The peak of MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes are weaker than that of MSi/CMC electrodes, demonstrating that the binding forces between CMC/TU binders and Si active materials strengthen through multiple hydrogen bonds to improve the electrode/electrolyte interface stability. Nevertheless, the characteristic cathodic (∼1.7 V) and anodic (∼1.9 and ∼2.4 V) peaks of CuxS can be seen clearly for MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes resulting from the lithiation and delithiation processes [49]. These peak areas increase along with the heat-treatment temperature and time, demonstrating that the higher temperature and longer time contribute to the formation of CuxS, as shown in the inserted images within Fig. 5b. The cycling performance and coulombic efficiency curves of MSi/CMC and MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes are tested at 210 mA g−1 (1st cycle) and 840 mA g−1 (2nd-150th cycles), as presented in Fig. 5c. The better cycling performance of MSi/CMC/TUs (>800 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles) than that of MSi/CMC120–2 (171 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles) demonstrates that CMC/TU binders can sustain electrode structure through multiple hydrogen bonds and CuxS layers binding strongly with active materials and current collectors, respectively. Besides, the cyclic stability of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrodes (1059 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles) are better than that of other MSi/CMC/TUs electrodes (<200 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles). In addition, the average capacity fading rates are 0.66% for MSi/CMC120–2, 0.62% for MSi/CMC/TU100–2, 0.46% for MSi/CMC/TU120–2, 0.58% for MSi/CMC/TU140–2, 0.65% for MSi/CMC/TU120–1, and 0.61% for MSi/CMC/TU120–3 from 2nd to 150th cycles, indicating that the optimal CuxS layer strengthens the physical interlocked forces and improves the electrochemical properties of Si anodes. As compared with previously reported polymeric binders, Si-based anodes using CMC/TU as binders in this work exhibits better cycling performance, as shown in Table S1. To investigate the effect of mass loading of Si active materials on the electrochemical performance, MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (1.2–1.4 and 1.6–1.8 mg cm−2) electrode disks were fabricated and measured at the same testing condition with the above-mentioned electrodes with mass loading of 0.8–1.0 mg cm−2, as shown in Fig. S13. The capacities of these two electrodes can reach 1044 mAh g−1 after 80 cycles and 1141 mAh g−1 after 56 cycles, respectively, indicating that the presence of the physical interlocked layer can also contribute to sustain the electrode structure for high mass loading electrodes. However, the cycling performance of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrodes deteriorate along with the increase of mass loading, because more Si particles per square centimetre would produce larger volume change and cause the pulverization of electrode materials. The MSi/CMC/TU electrode disks were fabricated using CMC and TU binders with mole ratios of 0.5:1 and 2:1, denoted as MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (0.5:1) and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (2:1). Fig. S14 shows that the cycling performance of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (0.5:1) and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (2:1) are poorer as compared with MSi/CMC/TU120–2, demonstrating that the optimal ratio of CMC and TU contributes to form stable structure and improve the electrochemical properties. To investigate the effect of CMC and CMC/TU binders on the electrochemical dynamic of Si anodes, the electrochemical impedance spectra before and after 150 cycles and the rate performance of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 were measured and collected in Fig. 5d and e. Before cycling, the charge transfer resistance (inserted in Fig. 5d) of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 is similar to that of MSi/CMC120–2. However, after 150 cycles, the resistance values (Fig. 5d) of SEI films (RSEI) and charge transfer (RCT) of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 are quantified according to the equivalent circuit model (insert in Fig. 5d). RSEI and RCT values of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 (101 and 223 Ω) are significantly lower than that of MSi/CMC120–2 (308 and 1147 Ω), indicating that CMC/TU binders can sustain the electrode structure through the improvement of binding forces with the surface of Si particles and Cu foils via multiple hydrogen bonds and physical interlocked layers, respectively. The rate performance (Fig. 5e) of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 is similar to that of MSi/CMC120–2 at low current densities. When the current densities increase to 0.5 C and 1.0 C, the specific capacity of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 is higher than that of MSi/CMC120–2. The capacity retentions at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 are 97, 78, and 58% for MSi/CMC/TU120–2, higher than that of MSi/CMC120–2, demonstrating the better rate performance of MSi/CMC/TU120–2. These results indicate that the bifunctional effect of CMC/TU binders on Si active materials and Cu foils contributes to the improvement of charge transportation within the electrodes. The morphology of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks before and after cycles were observed to investigate the effect of bifunctional CMC/TU binders on the electrode integrity of Si anodes. Before cycling, MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks (Fig. S15) show the similar morphology, which consist of MSi, carbon nanofiber, and CMC or CMC/TU binders. Fig. 6 presents the SEM images of MSi/CMC120–2 and MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks after 150 cycles. The surface of MSi/CMC120–2 electrode disks (Fig. 6a and b) mainly consist of cracks and SEI films. However, the structural integrity of the cycled MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrode disks is well maintained without cracks on their surface, as shown in Fig. 6d and e, indicating that the 3D network structure of CMC/TU binders and their strong binding forces with Si surface contribute to sustain the structural integrity of MSi/CMC/TU120–2 electrodes and enhance the electrode/electrolyte interface stability. In addition, in Fig. 6c, the separation of electrode materials with current collectors can be seen clearly for the cycled MSi/CMC120–2 electrode disks. But for MSi/CMC/TU120–2 sample (Fig. 6f), the electrode materials still maintain close contact with current collectors, suggesting that the physical interlocked layer contributes to improve the binding forces between electrode materials and current collectors. For MSi/CMC/TU100–2, MSi/CMC/TU140–2, MSi/CMC/TU120–1, and MSi/CMC/TU120–3 electrode disks after 150 discharge-charge cycles in Fig. S16, the electrode surfaces are covered by obvious cracks and excessive SEI layers, indicating the optimal heat-treated temperature and time facilitate to sustain the integrated electrode structure and the tight contact with current collectors. The electrochemical performance of MSi can be enhanced through the bifunctional effects of CMC/TU binders. Firstly, the three-dimensional networked structure of CMC/TU binders contributes to sustain the integrity of Si electrode during the repeated swelling and shrinking processes. Secondly, multiple hydrogen bonding forces of CMC/TU binders can maintain their close contact with Si active materials. Finally, the physical interlocked mechanism of CMC/TU binders with Cu current collectors are proposed as follows [45,50–52]. On the one hand, the formation of CuxS layers can increase the physical contact area of CMC/TU binders with Cu current collectors. On the other hand, -CuxS-Sy- and -C-S- bonds are probably generated at the interface between Cu current collectors and CMC/TU binders. In the practical battery system, Si particles, acetylene black nanoparticles, and CMC/TU binders are alternative distributed at the interface between electrode materials and current collectors within Si electrodes. The large volume change of Si nanoparticles during the discharge and charge processes leads to the separation of electrode materials with current collectors. The presence of CuxS layers at the interface can increase the binding forces and sustain the close contact between CMC/TU binders and Cu current collectors."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we provide an effective approach for avoiding the separation of electrode materials with current collectors to enhance the electrochemical properties of Si anodes. The as-synthesized polymeric binders (CMC/TU) possess bifunctional effects on Cu current collectors and Si active materials through physical interlocked forces and hydrogen bonds, respectively. The copolymerization of CMC with TU and the formation of CuxS interlocked layer occur during the drying process of Si electrode disks, which is simple, low-cost, easy scale-up. MSi electrodes using CMC/TU as binders exhibit high coulombic efficiency (89.9%) and good cycling properties (1059 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles). The construction of physical interlocked layer at the interface between polymeric binders and current collectors can also be extensively used to enhance the electrochemical performance of other electrodes with large volume change."
