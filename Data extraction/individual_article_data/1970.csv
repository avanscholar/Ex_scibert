0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is regarded as an ideal clean and eco-friendly energy carrier. In recent years, hydrogen production has attracted much attention and been the subject of very active research [1–3]. Steam reforming (SR) of methane [4,5], alcohols [6,7], and hydrocarbons [8,9] is the main technology to produce hydrogen. However, to obtain high purity of H2 from SR process, multiple steps, typically including water gas shift (WGS), methanation and pressure swing adsorption [10], are inevitable and energy-intensive, which complicate the operations and increase the costs [11]. Coupling SR process with in-situ CO2 capture, sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR) process provides a simple process to produce high-purity hydrogen [12,13]. The SESR reaction integrates CO2 capture, WGS and SR reaction into a single step, therefore the thermodynamic equilibrium of SR will shift toward H2 formation and hence enhance hydrogen concentration [14,15]. Generally speaking, SESR can upgrade the hydrogen concentration of reformate from 50 to 80% to 95%-99%. Broda et al. reported that ~99% purity of hydrogen was obtained during SESR of methane reaction in a single step [16]. With two moving-bed reactors, Dou et al. achieved a continuous 96.1% hydrogen through the SESR of glycerol which is an abundant by-product from biodiesel manufacturing [17]. Chen et al. showed the direct production of fuel-cell grade H2 with CO less than 10 ppm in the SESR of acetic acid [18]. Recently, Dou et al. showed the SESR technology could further integrate with chemical looping steam reforming which called sorption-enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (SE-CLSR) processes, and the SE-CLSR reduced the heat demands of CaO based sorbent’ regeneration and attain low energy penalties [19–21]. All the works above showed a great potential of SESR in producing high-purity hydrogen. CaO-based materials are the most commonly used CO2 sorbents in SESR reaction due to its most advantageous characteristics, such as low cost and wide availability of CaO precursors [22], high CO2 capture capacity and fast kinetics of CO2 sorption-desorption [23]. However, the practical application of the CaO-based sorbent was severely limited by the rapid decline of its sorption capacity caused by the sintering-induced deterioration of microstructure during the high-temperature adsorption-desorption cycles [13,23–26]. It is usually observed that CO2 adsorption capacity decreases by 60–80% (Table S1) within the first 10 cycles for pure CaO or limestone sorbent [13,16,23]. For example, a continuously decrease in CO2 adsorption capacity from 100% to 54.8% and 24.2% in the fifth and tenth cycles, respectively, has been reported over limestone as sorbent [16]. He et al. showed a loss of adsorption capacity for limestone up to 85% after 20 cycles [27]. One of an effective approach to improve the cyclic CO2 uptake performance of CaO is incorporation of refractory materials such as Ca12Al14O33 [14,26,28], Ca5Al6O14 [29,30], MgO [23], and ZrO2 [31] as physical spacer. However, the promoting effect (Table S1) was only apparent when the inert spacers were in a large amount around 50 wt% [32]. In the case of 60 wt% MgO as inert spacer, the loss of CO2 capture capacity was less than 22% [33]. Bi-functional catalysts (Table 1 ) integrated metal catalysts and sorbents in a single particle presented the similar trend as well. Vanga et al. introduced 63 wt% Ca12Al14O33 as inert spacers in the synthesis of Ni-Ca-Al-O bi-functional catalyst and about 10% decay of CO2 capture capacity was observed [28]. Unfortunately, inert spacers do not contribute to the adsorption capacity or catalytic activity, resulting in low sorbent capacity (Table 1) and reducing the overall effectiveness of the process. Moreover, 40–60% losses have been reported in some bi-functional catalysts with 30–40 wt% spacers [14,16]. Comparing with the introduction of inert spacers, the preparation of CaO-based sorbents with porous structures is a more effective strategy to enhance the stability of adsorption performance [23,26,34–36]. Using paper fibre as a biotemplate, Li et al. prepared CaO-Ca12Al14O33 sorbent with a hollow microtube-like structure, and the loss of CO2 capture capacity was less than 10% after 10 adsorption–desorption cycles when the content of Al2O3 was 7.5 wt% [26]. Wang et al. synthesized Mn-promoted double-shelled hollow CaO using carbon microspheres as templates. When the doping amount of MnO was 11.5 wt%, the initial and final capacity of the sorbent in 25 cycles was 0.62 g-CO2/g-ads and 0.53 g-CO2/g-ads, respectively, showing less than 15% decay of CO2 capture capacity [35]. The stable CO2 uptake of these sorbents was contributed to the porous structure [23]. Meanwhile, the hollow porous sorbents were beneficial to handling the collapsing problem led by the continuous volume variation. However, to the best of our knowledge, designing porous structure to enhance the stability of sorbents in SESR reaction has been very rarely reported, especially for the bi-functional catalysts [37,38]. Herein, we attempted to design and fabricate a porous Ni-CaO-MgO bi-functional catalyst to improve the stability of SESR of glycerol (SESRG). The bi-functional catalyst was prepared by a template-assisted synthesis approach (Fig. S1) that yielded MgO-stabilized, Ni and CaO microspheres which were a spacer, active metal and sorbent featuring highly porous morphology. This porous structure was evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 adsorption–desorption tests. Meanwhile, MgO had been found to reduce the particle size of CaO and stabilize the structure of bi-functional catalyst. This work will offer a facile way to achieve the production of high purity H2 from SESRG."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of bi-functional catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of bi-functional catalyst All the bi-functional catalysts in this work were prepared by a hydrothermal method [23]. Typically, a solution was prepared by dissolving xylose (80 mmol) and glycine (13.2 mmol) at room temperature in 34 mL deionized water. Then, a solution of the mixture containing dissolved metal nitrates (Ni, Ca and Mg) (34 mmol, 10 mL) was introduced in appropriate quantities to the xylose solution with vigorous stirring. After mixing for 10 min, 6 mL of an aqueous urea solution (6 M) was added to the reaction mixture under stirring, followed by transferring to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and keeping at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained precipitates were filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol, then drying at 80 °C overnight to obtain carbonaceous sphere, followed by calcining in air at 800 °C for 2 h to produce the xNi-CMy bi-functional catalysts, where x represents the weight fraction of Ni, CMy represents the Ca/Mg molar ratio of y. The used catalyst was labeled as n-R and the decarbonized catalyst as n-C, where n stands for the number of cycles."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS, Hitachi Z-5000) was used to measure the veritable content of the catalysts. The textural properties of the reduced catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption at −196 °C (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics). Before the analysis, the sample was degassed at 250 °C under vacuum overnight. The specific surface areas were gained from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equations. The total pore volumes were measured at the relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99 and the pore size distributions were determined by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA). The Scherrer equation was used to calculate the mean crystallite size according to the (1 1 1) diffraction peak of Ni, the (2 0 0) peak of CaO, the (1 0 1) peak of Ca(OH)2, the (2 0 0) peak of MgO and the (1 0 4) peak of CaCO3. To analyze the reduction behavior of the sample, a TP-5080 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to carry out the H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) test. 50 mg samples were pretreated at 350 °C for 30 min under flowing N2 (30 mL/min). Upon cooling to room temperature, 30 mL/min of 10 vol% H2/N2 was used for the reduction with temperature ramping at 10 °C/min from 30 to 800 °C. The surface morphology and the micro-structure of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Merlin) attached to energy dispersiveX-ray spectroscopy(EDS, Oxford) operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF STEM) images, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analyses for the elemental distribution mappings were recorded in a JEM-2100F operated at 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, STA449 NETZSCH) was used to investigate the CO2 adsorption capacity. The sample was ramped from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 flow."
4,Sorption test,"2.3 Sorption test The sorption property was performed in a fixed bed quartz reactor in I.D. of 10 mm and length of 280 mm at atmospheric pressure. 0.2 g catalyst without dilution was sandwiched by quartz wool and packed in reactor. A thermocouple was inserted into the center of the catalytic bed to monitor and control the reaction temperature by a PID temperature controller with a temperature fluctuation of ±2 °C. The mass flowmeters (Sevenstar D08, with accuracy of 1%) were used to control the flow rates of gas. Before the test, the catalyst was heating from room temperature to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and reduced at 650 °C for 30 min in flowing H2 (30 NmL/min). Then, the reactor was purged with 30 NmL/min N2 for 20 min. For the sorption test of commercial CaO produced by calcinating limestone, 0.2 g sample was heating to 550 °C in 30 NmL/min N2. The carbonation was conducted at 550 °C for 20 min in 30 NmL/min 10 vol% CO2/N2, and the decarbonation was conducted in N2 (30 NmL/min) at 800 °C for 30 min. A gas chromatograph (GC, FuLi 9790) was used to detect the CO2 content in off gas every 1 min to calculate the CO2 sorption capacity. The GC was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). A TDX 01 column was used for H2 analysis in TCD. CO, CH4 and CO2 were analyzed by FID with a packed column for analyzing transformer oil. CO and CO2 were converted to methane in a methanator packed with Ni catalyst before entering FID. Meanwhile, to compare with the other’s works in which CO2 sorption capacity were usually evaluated by TGA [14,16,39], the samples after carbonation at first and 10 cycles were also analyzed by TGA. The adsorption capacity of sorbents and CaO utilization were calculated through the following equations: C O 2 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y = m loss m sample - m loss C a O u t i l i z a t i o n ( % ) = m loss m CaO × 56 44 × 100 % where msample, mloss and mCaO represent the mass of initial sample, loss mass of the sample and CaO mass in the sample, respectively."
5,SESRG test,"2.4 SESRG test 0.5 g bi-functional catalyst was used in SESRG experiments. Before the reactions, the bi-functional catalyst was heated from room temperature to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and activated at 650 °C for 30 min in H2 (30 NmL/min) flow. After cooling the reactor to 550 °C and purging for 20 min in 30 NmL/min N2, an aqueous solution of glycerol/water mixture (S/C = 4) with 30 NmL/min N2 as carried gas was fed into the same fixed bed reactor through a capillary tube at 0.02 mL/min (WHSV = 0.77 h−1) to start the SESRG reaction for 30 min. Then, the reactor was heated to 800 °C under N2 flow of 30 NmL/min and held for 30 min to regenerate the bi-functional catalyst. The concentrations of CO, CO2, H2 and CH4 in the off-gas were monitored every 2 min by GC. The liquid product was collected at the outlet in a cold trap in an ice bath every 30 min, and then the averaged conversion of glycerol was analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Agilent 1260) equipped with a refractive index detector. The conversion of glycerol is calculated by: X g l y = Glycerol in - Glycerol out Glycerol in × 100 % The concentrations of gaseous products are calculated by: C i % = [ i ] [ H 2 ] + C O + C H 4 + [ C O 2 ] × 100 The yield of H2 was defined as: Y H 2 % = m o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d 7 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l c o n v e r t e d × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,"The evolution of XRD patterns of the reduced 10Ni-CMy bi-functional catalysts with different Ca/Mg molar ratios are plotted in Fig. 1 . The formation of Ni was verified by the existence of characteristic peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, while the invisible of nickel-containing species suggested the they had been completely reduced. The appearance of Ca(OH)2 was owed to the highly hygroscopic nature of CaO which derived from the calcined catalysts [23,40,41]. It was surprising that the peaks of CaO were not detected, and this might indicate that the presence of small CaO particles which caused CaO to be completely covered by Ca(OH)2 or transformed to Ca(OH)2. After the incorporation of Mg, the catalysts exhibited a new diffraction peak at 42.9° which is the characteristic peak of MgO (2 0 0). Moreover, the peak was sharper with the decrease of Ca/Mg molar ratio, and this was caused by the agglomeration of MgO crystallite. It was should be noted that there was no solid solution between CaO and MgO due to the limited solubility of CaO in MgO [42], suggesting the mixing between CaO and MgO phases was a purely “physical” phenomenon [23]. Elemental analyses for bi-functional catalysts detected by AAS are summarized in Table 2 . Despite a certain variance, the content of Ni measured by AAS was in a good consistency with the nominal value. Meanwhile, according to the results, the molar ratios of Ca to Mg of 10Ni-CM9, 10Ni-CM7, 10Ni-CM4 and 10Ni-CM2 catalysts were 10, 7.1, 4.1 and 1.8, corresponding a MgO content of 5.9, 8.1, 13.0 and 25.0 wt%, respectively. These quantities of MgO were significantly lower than the reported contents so far in most CaO-based sorbents or bi-functional catalysts [43,44]. Moreover, the crystallite sizes of Ni and Ca(OH)2 calculated from the XRD data using the Scherrer equation did not show obvious difference with the change of Ca/Mg molar ratio, revealing that the introduction and content of MgO did not have a notable impact on the crystallite sizes of Ni and Ca(OH)2. However, the crystallite size of MgO had apparently grown up with the increase of MgO content. Although MgO had little effect on the average pore size and pore volume of the catalyst, the presence of MgO increased the specific surface area. The addition of 5.9 wt% MgO (10Ni-CM9) increased the surface area of the catalyst from 16.05 m2/g to 17.26 m2/g. And the surface area was further increased to 26.36 m2/g when 8.1 wt% MgO (10Ni-CM7) was incorporated. However, excessive MgO would lead to the decrease of the surface area, very likely due to the small MgO particles blocking the pores. All the bi-functional catalysts showed much higher surface area than the commercial CaO, supporting the superiority of template-assisted hydrothermal method. On the other hand, 10Ni-CM7 sample showed more concentrated pore size distribution (Fig. S2). H2-TPR measurement was performed to study the reducibility of the calcined 10Ni-CMy bi-functional catalysts with different Ca/Mg molar ratios. As shown in Fig. 2 , the TPR curves show the presence of four types of Ni species. The first reduction peak between 300 and 400 °C (peak 1) was assigned as the reduction of small surface phase Ni species [45]. While the peak in the range of 400–500 °C (peak 2) was caused by the reduction of large crystals of bulk NiO [39,46]. These free NiO (peak 1 and peak 2) had very poorly interacting with the support [47], since the reduction of unsupported NiO occurred at the similar temperature [16,48]. Meanwhile, the content of free NiO was decreased by addition of MgO due to the enhancement of the interaction between Ni and the support [49]. A shoulder peak started from 500 to 700 °C was observed, and it was ascribed to the reductions of NiO with weak and strong interaction with CaO or MgO [47]. Obviously, the existence of MgO had enhanced the reduction of Ni species, evidenced by the shift of peak 4 to low temperature. H2-TPR results also indicated that NiO was totally reduced below 650 °C, which was supported by the results of XRD (Fig. 1). SEM observations are carried out to reveal the micro-structural evolution of the synthesized materials, and the results are presented in Fig. 3 . The carbonaceous sphere (Fig. 3(a)) which formed in situ from xylose precursor during hydrothermal synthesis had been shown. The carbonaceous sphere acted as a template and encapsulate compounds of Ni, Ca and Mg species that were precipitated simultaneously via the hydrolysis of urea. After thermal removal of the template and reduction, the material transformed to microspheres with highly porous shells (Fig. 3(b)) which was composed of Ni, CaO and MgO nanoparticles. Meanwhile, some hollow microspheres presented in Fig. S3(a). Regrettably, the hollow structure could not be obviously identified from TEM (Fig. S3(b)) which was owed to the existence of a large amount of Ni particles. The porous structure could provide sufficient void space for the occurrence of SESR reaction. And the hollow structure provided the required volume to offset the pronounced volume variations originating from the repeated adsorption–desorption cycles, thus improving stability [35,36]. On the other hand, the porous microsphere structure (Fig. 3(c)) was still existed even after experiencing high-temperature SESRG reaction. This also reflected the stability of the structure of 10Ni-CM7 sample. The SEM inset of Fig. 3(c) showed that small MgO particles were uniformly dispersed on CaCO3 surface, which effectively separated CaCO3 particles. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the CaO particle size of 10Ni-Ca was obviously larger than 10Ni-CM7 (Fig. 3(b)). The statistical results (Fig. S4) further revealed that the average size of CaO nanoparticles of 10Ni-CM7 and 10Ni-Ca are 104.4 ± 18.8 nm and 200.3 ± 33.7 nm, respectively. This directly proved the presence of MgO minimized the size of CaO particles [23]. On the other hand, the elemental mapping of Ni, Ca and Mg (Fig. S5) indicated the homogeneous distribution of Ni, MgO and CaO in the micron size range. And the enrichment of Ni species at the surface was evidenced by the results of EDS (Fig. S5(e)). To further evaluate the compositional homogeneity of 10Ni-CM7 catalyst, the sample was characterized by HAADF-STEM with EDS analyses. As revealed by representative magnification HAADF image in Fig. 4 (a) and elemental mapping of Ni in Fig. 4(d), the Ni particles were uniformly dispersed on the support. Meanwhile, some agglomerated Ni particles were also observed which was caused by the high calcination temperature (800 °C). The elemental mapping of Mg (Fig. 4(c)) indicated the presence of MgO in the form of uniformly dispersed nanoparticles on the surface, supported by interval dispersion of Mg element. Fig. 4(e) and (f) showed a homogeneous mixing among the Ni, Mg and Ca, demonstrating the formation of well-mixed catalysts, sorbents and stabilizers on nanoscale, which was a key requirement for the effective structural stabilization. Fig. 5 (a) shows a typical CO2 adsorption breakthrough curve over the 10Ni-CM7 catalyst. Obviously, CO2 concentration maintained at a low level in the breakthrough period due to CO2 capture by bi-functional catalyst. With sorption capacity of catalyst decreasing, the concentration of CO2 rose quickly. In terms of sorption capacity, the breakthrough time, defined as the point when CO2 concentration exceeds 1.0 vol%, was used as a descriptor to evaluate the cyclic stability. As shown in Fig. 5(b), 10Ni-CM7 showed the highest initial CO2 sorption capacity among the 10Ni-CMy catalysts. This was a compromise between high CaO content and porous property, which provided more available CaO to participate in CO2 adsorption. Although commercial CaO presented high initial CO2 sorption capacity, it suffered from a serious performance fading. All 10Ni-CMy showed higher stability than commercial CaO, confirming the superiority of porous microsphere structure. Moreover, it also proved the introduction of MgO enhanced the cyclic stability. The highest sorption capacity and cyclic stability were achieved over the 10Ni-CM7 catalyst, which retained 58.3% capacity of the initial one after 10 cycles. Fig. S6(b) further shows that CaO utilization of 10Ni-CM7 measured by TGA was 59.1% after 10 cycles of repeated CO2 sorption–desorption, which exceeded the commercial CaO by ~109%. The CO2 adsorption capacity of 10Ni-CM7 (Fig. S6(a)) after 10 cycles was 0.374 gCO2/gcat. It was higher than those of typical bi-functional catalysts in the literatures usually reporting cyclic CO2 uptakes lowers than 0.20 gCO2/gcat [39,50–52]. The SESRG experiments were carried out at S/C ratio of 4 and 550 °C which are the optimized parameters in our previous work [53]. The results were shown in Fig. 6 and only the H2 and CO2 profiles were given for the sake of classify [39]. The profiles were divided into three characteristic regions, usually namely pre-breakthrough, breakthrough and post-breakthrough regions [39,54]. The high-purity hydrogen (98.66 vol%) and low concentration of CO2 (0.31 vol%) were achieved in the pre-breakthrough region over the 10Ni-CM7 catalyst, while the H2 and CO2 concentrations in the post-breakthrough region were 72.00 vol% and 23.31 vol%, respectively, indicating the significant increase in hydrogen purity through sorption-enhanced effect. Meanwhile, almost complete conversion of glycerol (Table S2) proved the high catalytic activity of 10Ni-CM7. Hydrogen yield in the pre-breakthrough stage was up to 96.34% higher than the post-breakthrough stage (92.63%). The improvement should result from CO2 capture which promoted the generation of H2. The content of MgO (Fig. 6) and Ni (Fig. S7) had little effect on the hydrogen purity. However, 10Ni-CM7 catalyst showed the longest pre-breakthrough period with CO2 concentration above 2.0 vol%, correlating the improved CO2 sorption capacity of 10Ni-CM7 (Fig. 5(b)). While, the better performance of 10Ni-Ca than 10Ni-CM4 and 10Ni-CM2 was due to the higher CaO content of 10Ni-Ca (Table 1). Ten SESRG-desorption cycles were performed to evaluate the stability of the 10Ni-CM7 catalyst. Fig. 7 (a) illustrates that the three typical stages were observed repeatedly during cycling, indicating that the sorption-enhanced effect existed in the whole process. Meanwhile, H2 purity (Fig. 7(b)) in the pre-breakthrough stage was maintained above 96.5 vol%, just showing negligible decay. The pre-breakthrough duration is deemed as an important indicator for the reaction stability of producing high-purity hydrogen, and the results are displayed in Fig. 7(b). The pre-breakthrough period decreased from 20 min for the first cycle to 12 min for the fourth cycle and then leveled off at 12 min till the tenth cycle, showing 40% loss in CO2 adsorption capacity. The aforementioned results demonstrated that the porous microsphere Ni-CaO-MgO bi-functional catalyst developed in this work could be used as an efficient and stable material for high-purity H2 in SESR process. As revealed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 8 , there were no obvious significant changes in the characteristic peaks of Ni and MgO, implying the stability of Ni and Mg species. Table 3 shows the sizes of MgO crystallite retained almost unchanged after 10 cycles. And this was ascribed to high Tamman temperature of MgO (~1290 °C) [23]. Ni crystallite was slightly sinterized with the size increase of 10%. On the other hand, although the agglomeration of CaO was observed, the size of CaO was still smaller than the critical thickness of CaO (~50 nm), allowing carbonation in the rapid reaction-controlled region [55]. The specific surface area of 10Ni-CM7 after 10 cyclic tests was still up to 18.69 m2/g at high desorption temperature (800 °C), evidencing the stability of material structure. Meanwhile, after 10 cycles, the used catalyst (Fig. S8) still possessed porous structure. TEM analysis was performed to study the morphological changes of the catalyst after 10 SESRG-desorption cycles. As presented in Fig. 9 , Ni particles were still uniformly dispersed on the support. However, the Ni particles grew from 30.4 nm (see the histogram in Fig. 4(a)) to 44.7 nm (see the histogram in Fig. 9(a)) after 10 cycles, indicating the sintering of Ni particles at high temperature. The elemental mapping of Mg (Fig. 9(c)) revealed the interval dispersion of Mg element and no substantial enrichment of Mg element, suggesting the stability of MgO as stabilizers during the dynamic SESRG-desorption cycles. Moreover, Ni, Ca and Mg elements remained even distribution in the whole process. These results further supported the stable performance of porous microsphere bi-functional catalyst for SESRG reaction."
7,Conclusion,"In this work, we synthesized a porous microsphere Ni-CaO-MgO bi-functional catalyst by a template-assisted hydrothermal method. The characterization results indicated the catalyst possessed a MgO-stabilized, Ni and CaO microspheres featuring highly porous morphologies with high specific surface area. This structure satisfied a critical requirement for a high CaO utilization, and the CaO utilization of 10Ni-CM7 after 10 cycles was 59.1% exceeding the commercial CaO by ~109%. MgO was found to minimize the particle size of CaO and stabilize the structure of bi-functional catalyst. After 10 cycles of repeated SESRG-desorption, 10Ni-CM7 as the best performing material required as little as 8.1 wt% MgO just showed 40% loss in sorption-enhanced effect. This work offered a facile one-pot way to stably produce high purity H2 from SESRG."
