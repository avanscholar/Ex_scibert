0,Introduction,"Broad range of studies on the nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds with the help of biopolymers as wall materials are being undertaken in these years to protect and induce a controlled release system of bioactive compounds. Nanoscale normally refers to a size <100 nm in the field of drug/nutraceutical delivery (Esfanjani & Jafari, 2016; Jafari, 2017; Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Kashiri, & Shakeri, 2020). Among various methods for nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds, the electrospinning method due to some advantages, such as production under ambient temperature without application of toxic solvents can be considered as a proper method for nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds in the food industry to maintain food safety (Ramakrishna et al., 2010; Weiss, Gaysinsky, Davidson, & McClements, 2009). Electrospun nanofibers because of some benefits such as desirable elongation, thickness, high surface-to-volume ratio, high porosity, non-contact production and amplified performance are preferred among other nanofiber manufacturing processes, such as drawing, thttps://translate.google.com/emplate synthesis, phase separation and self-assembly (Fahami & Fathi, 2018; Hoseyni, Jafari, Tabarestani, et al., 2020). In the electrospinning process, natural biopolymers can be converted to nanoscale fibers by exposure to a very high voltage electric field that creates charged fluid from positive pole to the negative pole (Rostami, Yousefi, Khezerlou, Mohammadi, & Jafari, 2019). Behavior of polysaccharides in response to high electric field applied in the electrospinning process can be classified into three groups: (i) the first group can form fibers, (ii) second ones can generate jets but do not form fibers, and finally, (iii) third group is unable to form jets (Stijnman, Bodnar, & Tromp, 2011). Gums as a new source of biopolymers are interesting candidates for the production of nanofibers (Taheri & Jafari, 2019). The leaf gum extracted from Azivash (Corchorus olitorius L.) has an appropriate viscosity (8.23 mPa s, 2g L−1, 40 rpm) to be used in the electrospinning process in comparison to other commercial hydrocolloids capable of jet formation (Hoseyni, Jafari, Shahiri Tabarestani et al., 2020); however, they are not able to form fibers (Yamazaki, Kurita, & Matsumura, 2008). Synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) have a hydroxyl group on each of its monomers; these groups are bonded to other polymers and facilitate the electrospinning process via converting solution to gel state (Fahami & Fathi, 2018; Islam & Karim, 2010; Kurd, Fathi, & Shekarchizadeh, 2017; Rezaei, Tavanai, & Nasirpour, 2016). Numerous studies have been undertaken to incorporate PVA with various gums as an aiding agent in the electrospinning process, such as cress seed gum (Fahami & Fathi, 2018), almond gum (Rezaei et al., 2016), basil seed gum (Kurd et al., 2017), alginate (Islam & Karim, 2010), agar (Sousa et al., 2015) and gum Arabic, karaya and kondagogu gum (Padil, Senan, Wacſ;awek, & Ŀerník, 2016), with PVA (10% w/v) levels between 60 and 70%. These researchers reported that PVA as an aiding agent resulted in a successful electrospinning process. Natural antioxidants such as catechins, have some limitations due to their instability under processing or storage conditions, that can be protected by encapsulation (Sabaghi et al., 2020; Sabaghi, Maghsoudlou, Khomeiri, & Ziaiifar, 2015). Many studies have been conducted in the field of nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds via electrospinning process to protect and transport these bioactive compounds to the target zone. For example, Neo et al. (2013) applied zein biopolymer to target gallic acid encapsulation. The results of antioxidant activity test showed that the inhibitory activity of gallic acid did not differ significantly before and after the electrospinning process and gallic acid encapsulation in zein nanofibers resulted in a controlled release of this antioxidant. Aytac et al. (2016) investigated the release behavior of gallic acid-cyclodextrin antioxidant complexes encapsulated by poly(lactic) acid (PLA) electrospun nanofibers in three media: aqueous, 10% and 95% ethanol. The release process of gallic acid from a PLA-gallic acid-cyclodextrin mixture was similar to PLA-gallic acid in all the three media. Gallic acid release reached a steady-state behavior after the initial burst release. They reported that surface area and type of medium are the most important factors affecting the release rates. Gallic acid, due to its hydrophilic nature, showed the highest release rate in aqueous and 10% ethanol media. Tampau et al. (2018) investigated the release kinetics of carvacrol encapsulated in poly(ε-caprolactone) electrospun nanofibers and applied them in starch multilayer films. The highest ratio and release rate of carvacrol was obtained in low-polarity simulated food media, such as 10% ethanol and 3% acetic acid. Polar media including 50% ethanol and isooctane, revealed a controlled release of carvacrol from the synthesized nanofibers. Aytac, Keskin, Tekinay, and Uyar (2017) evaluated the release of α-tocopherol-γ-cyclodextrin antioxidant complexes encapsulated in PLA electrospun nanofibers for food packaging. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance test showed that the application of these nanofibers on beef at 4 °C significantly reduced the oxidation rate. Therefore, these nanofibers were suggested as active packaging materials for long-term food storage. Nanofibers can be considered as a carrier of bioactive compound for health practices. As an example, Li, Kim, Chen, and Park (2016) encapsulated gallic acid in calcium alginate structure; in the first 30 min, more than 90% of gallic acid was released in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) (Jinglei, Li, Kim, Chen, & Park, 2016). Also, Li et al. (2018) encapsulated tocopherol in zein and mixture of zein and gum Arabic at a ratio of 1:10. The release rate of nanoparticles from zein was significantly higher than mixed zein and gum Arabic in SGF. On the other hand, the release process was not significant in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) (Juan Li et al., 2018). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the release of catechin as a natural antioxidant from innovative nanofibers in different food and digestion simulated media to apply these nanofibers for food packaging and drug delivery applications."
1,Materials and methods,"Azivash leaves were harvested in July 2018 from Shastkolah farm, Gorgan, Iran. Deionized distilled water (D.D.W) from Zolal Company (Iran), green tea catechin 96% HPLC grade from Chemsavers Company (USA), polyvinyl alcohol (Mw = 124 kDa, 99% hydrolyzed), ethanol 99%, isopropanol and other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Germany)."
2,Azivash gum extraction,"2.1 Azivash gum extraction As shown in Fig. 1 , Azivash leaves were powdered after drying at room temperature and screened through a mesh (0.425 mm sieve size). Accordance to the method of Brummer, Cui, and Wang (2003) with some modification, Azivash leaf powder was dissolved in the D.D.W ratio 1:30 (w/v) on a magnetic stirrer at 700 rpm in ambient temperature for 45 min. Then for purification, the mixture was passed through a filter cloth to separate the slurry and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 40 min (Centurion Scientific, K240, UK). The extracted gum was mixed with ethanol at −18 °C at a ratio of 30:70 (v/v) and was rinsed three times with pure isopropanol at 50:50 ratio. Finally, under vacuum conditions (0.01 Pa and −48 °C ), it was dried 72 h by a freeze dryer (Operon, FDB5503, South Korea) to obtain powder (Brummer et al., 2003). Extracted dried gum powder was about 54 g kg−1 of dry leaves. Azivash gum solutions at a concentration of 2 g L-1 in aqueous solution, was prepared by dissolving Azivash gum powder in D.D.W at 40 °C on a magnetic stirrer (700 rpm) for half a day and completed hydration in the refrigerator (4 °C) overnight. PVA solution at a concentration of 80 g L-1 was dissolved in D.D.W under magnetic stirring (700 rpm at 80 °C) until completely dissolved. Polymer solutions were mixed for 12 h using a magnetic stirrer (700 rpm) at a 70:30 ratio of PVA solution to Azivash gum solution. Finally, catechin at concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg L−1 was added into mixed polymer solutions."
3,Electrospinning process,"2.2 Electrospinning process The electrospinning device was equipped by a 10 mL syringe with a G18 needle containing polymer solutions (Fig. 1) and the electrospinning process was done at a high voltage of 20 kV, a feeding rate of 0.9 mL/h and needle to collector plate distance of 11 cm."
4,Instrumental analysis of catechin-loaded nanofibers,"2.3 Instrumental analysis of catechin-loaded nanofibers The morphology of the nanofiber was investigated by SEM (Tescan, Vegall, Germany). Nanofibers containing 500 and 1000 mg L-1 were coated with a thin layer of gold (5 min) and were taken at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and magnification of 10,000×. Then mean diameter of nanofibers was estimated through measuring an average diameter of 100 nanofibers by Digimizer software version 2018. ATR-FTIR spectrum (FT-IR Spectrophotometer, Alpha, Bruker, USA, OPUS Software) in the transient state was determined using a spectrophotometer in the range of 500–4000 cm−1 (Rezaei et al., 2016). Thermal stability of the generated nanofibers was investigated by Thermogravimetric Analysis (PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen-containing space at a temperature range of 30–700 °C (Varsha, Bajpai, & Navin, 2010)."
5,Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of nanofibers,"2.4 Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of nanofibers Encapsulation efficiency was determined according to the method of (Qi et al., 2010) through the amount of uncoated catechin via washing 15 mg of nanofibers with 15 mL of 99% ethanol; [(Total weight of catechin-Surface catechin)/Total weight of catechin] × 100 and loading capacity was determined as [(Total weight of catechin/Weight of nanofiber] × 100. Catechin content was measured via the spectrophotometry (Abs 765 nm) by the Folin-Ciocalteu method (Kodama, Gonçalves, Lajolo, & Genovese, 2010). Amount of catechin (g kg−1) was determined according to the standard curve (Y = 0.0775 + 0.9696X, R2 = 0.9725) which Y is Absorbance and X is mg L−1 catechin concentration."
6,Measurment of catechin release rate in the simulated gastrointestinal media,"2.5 Measurment of catechin release rate in the simulated gastrointestinal media Determination of catechin release from nanofibers in gastrointestinal simulation media was done according to the method of Alborzi, Lim, and Kakuda (2014) with some modifications. Briefly, 15 mg of nanofiber sample was placed in 15 mL SGF buffer medium for 2 h at pH = 1.2 and then in 15 mL SIF buffer medium for 6 h at pH = 7.4. Sampling was done every 20 min and 40 min in the SGF and SIF, respectively (n = 3). The release of catechin from the nanofibers was then determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method (Section 2.2)."
7,Measurment of catechin release in simulated low fat and high fat media,"2.6 Measurment of catechin release in simulated low fat and high fat media Evaluation of catechin release was performed based on polarity differences of low-fat (30% ethanol) and high-fat (95% ethanol) food simulants at ambient temperature. To investigate catechin release into these simulated media, nanofibers with an area of 30 cm2 were immersed in 40 mL of 30% (Benbettaïeb, Chambin, Karbowiak, & Debeaufort, 2016b) and 95% (Chen, Lee, Zhu, & Yam, 2012) ethanol solutions. At each time, 250 μL of the solution was removed from each medium and then, catechin release was analyzed by the Folin–Ciocalteu method (Section 2.2)."
8,Modeling the catechin release data,"2.7 Modeling the catechin release data To study the kinetics of catechin release from nanofiber in simulated digestion and food simulant media, the raw release data were fitted in Higuchi (C= Kt 0.5), Rigter-Peppas (C= Kt n), Peppas-Sahlin (C= K1 × tm + K2 × t2m), and Kupcha (C= K1 × t0.5 +K2 × t) models. In these Equations, C is the concentration of catechin at time t, K1 and K2 are kinetics constants in the Pepas-Sahlin and the Kupcha model, and m and n are the release coefficients. In the Kupcha and the Peppas-Sahlin models, K1 and K2 are emission constants and degradation constants, respectively. The ratio of K1 to K2 indicates the release mechanism. In Higuchi model, n is the release coefficient; when n = 0.5, it indicates the release behavior rakes place due to diffusion; if n is between 0.5 and 1, then the release behavior encompasses both diffusion and erosion; and n = 1 indicates that catechin release mechanism from nanofibers takes place via erosion mechanism (Sabaghi et al., 2020)."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis Design of experiments was performed in a factorial design (∝ = 0.05) with SAS software (Version 9.1 Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Charts were plotted using Microsoft Excel 2013 and modeling of the release data was done using MATLAB 2010a."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of nanofibers,"3.1 Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of nanofibers The results of this study revealed that with increasing catechin concentration from 500 to 1000 mg L−1, encapsulation efficiency decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 98.98 to 84.48%, and loading capacity increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 0.59 to 1.02%. According to results, a positive correlation was observed between the average diameters of nanofibers and loading capacity; doubling the catechin concentration enhanced the average diameter of nanofibers from 130 to 148 nm. Similarly, Neo et al. (2013) showed that the encapsulation efficiency of electrospun nanofibers from zein incorporating gallic acid decreased as gallic acid concentration increased; also nanofibers of Alyssum homolocarpum seed gum containing limonene had the same trend with respect to lower encapsulation efficiency (Khoshakhlagh, Koocheki, Mohebbi, & Allafchian, 2017; Neo et al., 2013). Decreasing encapsulation efficiency can be due to insufficient capacity of polymeric matrix for entanglement of catechin (Luangtana-anan et al., 2005; Xu & Du, 2003). The encapsulation efficiency of catechin achieved in this work using electrospining technique was higher than those reported for catechin retention by other encapsulation methods, such as ionic gelation and solvent displacement techniques, where encapsulation efficiencies were 43 and 79%, respectively (Hu et al., 2008; Pool et al., 2012). This could be related to the fact that electrospining process is performed under ambient temperature and pressure, and does not involve severe chemical treatments (Khoshakhlagh et al., 2017; Ramakrishna et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2009)."
12,Chemical structure of catechin-loaded nanofibers,"3.2 Chemical structure of catechin-loaded nanofibers ATR-FTIR spectroscopy of PVA, Azivash gum, catechin, nanofibers with and without catechin are shown in Fig. 2 . Considering catechin, EGCG and ECG are the main ingredients demonstrating C═O stretching at 1745 cm−1, C–C stretching mode of aromatics at 1610 cm−1, and the C–O stretching at 1015 cm−1 (Kang, Kotaki, Okubayashi, & Sukigara, 2010; Quilez-Molina et al., 2020). In the PVA molecule, region of 3200–3550 cm−1 is related to the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the hydroxyl group. The bands of 2840–3000 are emerged due to the alkyl group and regions of 1735–1750 cm−1 are related to CO groups. The regions of 1417–1461 and 1085-1150 cm−1 are attributed to CH2 and C–O–C bonds respectively (Mansur, Sadahira, Souza, & Mansur, 2008). In the Azivash gum powder, band area of 1602, 1023, and 1416 cm−1 are related to symmetric stretching of carboxyl and carbonyl groups of uronic acid. Bands in the 900-1250 cm−1 region represent C–O and C–O–C vibrations of the glycosidic bond and C–O–H bonds. Symmetric stretching of the C-OO group of acetyl and carboxylic acid are depicted in the band area of 1732 cm−1, which indicates the presence of both uronic acid and carboxylic acid in the Azivash gum structure. C–H junctions with stretching vibrations including C–H, C–H2, and C–H3 in C-6 glycosidic units are observed at the band of 2992 cm−1 (Rezaei et al., 2016). Stretching vibrations of O–H in gum structure, which are due to intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds are revealed at peak of region 3100 cm−1, which are noticeable functional groups in the gum structure (Martins et al., 2012). As shown in Fig. 3 , some changes occurred in the band intensities of control samples by adding gum in the region between 784 and 907 cm−1; also the intensity of bands increased in the region of 1212–1309 cm−1 owing to higher glycosidic vibrations of C–O, C–C–O, and C–O–H bands. The addition of catechin into nanofiber formulation shifted the bands of 1674 cm−1 and 1546 cm−1 to lower wavenumber values which could be attributed to H-bonded C–O vibration indicating the formation of hydrogen bonds between nanofibers and catechin (Kang, Chen, Okubayashi, & Sukigara, 2012; Terao et al., 2009)."
13,Thermal properties of catechin-loaded nanofibers,"3.3 Thermal properties of catechin-loaded nanofibers The TGA graphs of PVA, control nanofibers and catechin-loaded nanofibers and Azivash gum are shown in Fig. 3. At first, weight loss takes place in nanofibers containing 1000 mg L−1 catechin compared to the control nanofibers and Azivash gum due to water loss from the samples (Kayaci & Uyar, 2012). The second thermal degradation started at 280 °C, so that Azivash gum, control samples and 1000 mg L−1 catechin-incorporated samples lost about 37%, 14% and 19% of their initial weight, respectively. In the sample of PVA, this stage began at 338 °C and weight loss was about 7.37%. Last stage of thermal degradation of nanofibers began at about 348 °C; also Azivash gum, control fibers and 1000 mg L−1 catechin-loaded samples reached 25% and 39% of the initial weight. In the PVA sample, this stage began at 529 °C and weight loss was about 77.84%. Weight loss is due to the depolymerization of polymer chains. In another study, it was shown that addition of catechin into polypropylene films increased the thermal stability of fibers containing catechin in contrast with non-catechin fibers (Arrieta et al., 2014); also same results were reported by Sabaghi et al. (2020) when catechin added into chitosan-PVA films (Sabaghi et al., 2020). As can be deduced from ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, higher thermal stability of nanofibers with adding catechin is due to higher interaction via hydrogen bonds with polymer solution (Kayaci & Uyar, 2012)."
14,Release kinetics of catechin in simulated gastrointestinal media,"3.4 Release kinetics of catechin in simulated gastrointestinal media The results of catechin release from electrospun nanofibers of Azivash gum-PVA containing catechin in SGF and SIF media are shown in Fig. 5. In SGF medium, the highest percentage of release occurred after 60 min, which lasted up to 80 min. At this time, due to surface release and subsequent swelling of nanofibers, approximately half of the total catechin in the nanofibers was released. In SIF medium, the final release rate of the samples containing 500 and 1000 mg L−1 of catechin was 69% and 66.21% of the total catechin in the nanofibers, respectively (Fig. 4 ). Li et al. (2016) encapsulated gallic acid as the bioactive compound in calcium-alginate beads and their results showed more than 90% gallic acid release in SGF, with the highest release in the first 30 min (Jinglei Li et al., 2016). Also, Li et al. (2018) investigated the release kinetics of tocopherol encapsulated in zein and zein-Arabic gum at a ratio of 1:10. Within 120 min of the time when nanoparticles were placed in the stomach simulation medium, the release rate in zein-Arabic gum mixtures was significantly lower than zein alone; also the release rate of tocopherol was not significant in the SIF medium (Juan Li et al., 2018). Blanco-Padilla, López-Rubio, Loarca-Pina, Gómez-Mascaraque, and Mendoza (2015) investigated the release of curcumin from amaranth-pullulan electrospun fibers in pH = 7.4 buffer solution. The results showed that nanoencapsulation significantly retained curcumin after digestion (Blanco-Padilla, López-Rubio, Loarca-Pina, Gómez-Mascaraque, & Mendoza, 2015). Alborzi et al. (2014) investigated the release of folic acid from sodium alginate-pectin-poly(ethylene oxide) electrospun fibers at pH = 1.2, 3.0 and 7.8. In these aqueous media, the highest folic acid release was at pH = 7.8, which was attributed to the widespread swelling and partial dissolution of the fibers. In the medium of SGF, folic acid release profile was similar to pH = 1.2. Contrary to the results of the SGF medium, the intestinal simulation at pH = 7.8 had a small amount of folic acid release up to 40% in comparison to the alkaline solution. They concluded that the folic acid release from alginate fibers in the SIF was influenced by the constituents of the medium and pH (Alborzi, Lim, & Kakuda, 2014). Higuchi, Rigter-Peppas, Peppas-Sahlin and Kupcha models were selected to determine the best catechin release model from Azivash gum-PVA nanofibers. The values for the parameters of each model are presented in Table 1 . R2 > 0.85 in the models indicates that catechin release from Azivash gum-PVA nanofibers fitted well to these models (Table 1). In order to find the best model with the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest degree of freedom of error, the coefficient of R2/RMSE was considered. Thus, the Kupcha and Peppas-Sahlin models with the highest R2/RMSE were selected as the best models for nanofibers containing 500 and 1000 mg L−1 catechin, respectively and release data were fitted to the gastrointestinal simulant media on these two models (Fig. 5). The nanofibers loaded with catechin had a K2 > K1, indicating that the erosion mechanism of the nanofiber structure takes place (Table 1)."
15,Release kinetics of catechin in simulated food media,"3.5 Release kinetics of catechin in simulated food media 3.5.1 Simulated low-fat food medium The release rate of catechin from Azivash gum-PVA electrospun nanofibers in simulated low-fat food (30% ethanol: 70% water v/v) are shown in Fig. 5 . The results revealed that the release rate of nanofibers containing 500 mg L−1 catechin reached from 28.04 to 74.42% over a period of 48–120 h. The final release rate of catechin (87.13%) was fixed after 168 h (Fig. 6 ). In nanofibers containing 1000 mg L−1 catechin, the highest percentage of catechin release started from 24 h (7.84%) and reached to 83.58% after 72 h and finally after 216 h in 87.28% was fixed; therefore, it can be concluded due to swelling of nanofibers, catechin release from the nanofibers increased. The higher release rate at 1000 mg L−1 catechin compared to 500 mg L−1 catechin concentration could be related to the decrease in nanoencapsulation efficiency that caused an increase in the catechin level on the surface of nanofibers. Results of tyrosol and ferulic acid release from gelatin-chitosan film structures (Benbettaïeb, Assifaoui, Karbowiak, Debeaufort, & Chambin, 2016a) and quercetin from chitosan-fish gelatin edible films (Benbettaïeb, Chambin, Karbowiak, & Debeaufort, 2016b) in 30% ethanol medium showed that the release time of tyrosol and ferulic acid was not dependent on the concentration of bioactive compound. Furthermore, quercetin release also occurred gradually over 250 min from chitosan-fish gelatin films. Aytac et al. (2016) investigated the release of gallic acid-cyclodextrin complexes encapsulated in PLA electrospun nanofibers in three media; aqueous, 10% ethanol and 95% ethanol. The release rate of gallic acid in water medium and 10% ethanol from nanofibers was higher than 95% ethanol; in addition, the release of gallic acid from the PLA-gallic acid-cyclodextrin nanofibers in 95% ethanol was slower than the PLA-gallic acid nanofibers. These researchers concluded that the surface area and type of medium are the most important factors affecting the release rate. Muriel-Galet et al. (2015) applied oregano essential oil and green tea extract in ethylene-PVA as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent. The release test was done in 3% acetic acid, 10% ethanol, and 50% ethanol. The highest antioxidant release from the films was reported in 50% ethanol. The results showed that the release kinetics was dependent on the concentration of the bioactive compound and its release medium. Tampau et al. (2018) investigated the release kinetics of carvacrol, nanoencapsulated in electrospun poly-(ε-caprolactone) nanofibers applied to starch multilayer films. The highest release rate of carvacrol was obtained in a low-polarity food simulated medium, such as 10% ethanol and 3% acetic acid. In polar systems like 50% ethanol and isooctane, there was a controlled release of carvacrol from the fibers. Higuchi, Rigter-Peppas, Peppas-Sahlin and Kupcha models were also used to determine the best catechin release model from Azivash gum-PVA nanofibers in 30% ethanol. The values for the parameters of models are given in Table 2 . In order to find the best model, the coefficient of R2/RMSE was considered. Thus, the Peppas-Sahlin model with the highest R2/RMSE was chosen as the best model and the release data was fitted in this model (Fig. 6). In the samples containing 500 and 1000 mg L−1 of catechin, K2 was larger than K1, indicating the degradation of nanofiber structure is the main mechanism of release (Table 2). 3.5.2 Simulated high-fat medium Release of catechin from electrospun nanofibers in high-fat food simulant medium (95% ethanol: 5% water) are shown in Fig. 6. The release of catechin started from the surface of electrospun nanofibers. Evaluation of catechin release at concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg L−1 revealed that the highest intensity of release was observed at times of 24–72 h, 120–144 and 240–288 h, respectively. However, during the initial 72 h, a greater difference was observed between the release rates of the Azivash gum-PVA nanofibers containing 500 and 1000 mg L−1 catechin; probably due to difference in loading capacity and release mechanism, with increasing release time (more than 144 h), the release rate decreased. Finally, after 288 h, approximately 86.72 and 86.18% of the total catechin released from the electrospun nanofibers of Azivash gum-PVA containing 500 and 1000 mg L−1 catechin in high fat simulation medium, respectively (Fig. 6). Aytac et al. (2017) investigated the release of α-tocopherol/γ-cyclodextrin complexes encapsulated in PLA nanofibers for packaging in high-fat food simulant medium. Due to higher solubility of PLA/α-tocopherol/γ-cyclodextrin, the release rate of α-tocopherol was more than PLA/α-tocopherol; therefore, these nanofibers were proposed as active packaging for long-term food storage (Aytac, Keskin, Tekinay, & Uyar, 2017). Sabaghi et al. (2020) investigated the release of catechin from chitosan nanoparticles trapped in mixture of chitosan and PVA films in high-fat simulant media (95% ethanol); the results showed that release kinetics in high fat simulant medium was two times lower than low-fat simulant medium (30% ethanol). Thus, these researchers concluded that slower release rate takes place due to differences in the polarity of two simulant media (Sabaghi et al., 2020). In order to select the best catechin release model from nanofibers considering Higuchi, Rigter- Peppas, Peppas-Sahlin and Kupcha model, the parameters of each model were determined (Table 3 ). The highest coefficient of R2/RMSE for electrospun nanofibers containing 500 and 1000 mg L−1 catechin was related to Peppas-Sahlin and Higuchi models, respectively, and the release data were fitted to these models (Fig. 6). Based on the results of the parameters in Peppas-Sahlin model in electrospun nanofibers contains 500 mg L−1 catechin, K2 was larger than K1, indicating the release happens due to the destruction of the nanofibers structure. In nanofibers containing 1000 mg L−1 catechin, based on the models parameter, the release mechanism from the nanofibers was due to the diffusion phenomenon (Table 3). Increasing the catechin level improved the structure of the nanofibers and thus nanofibers endure in high-fat medium."
16,Conclusion,"Nanoencapsulation of catechin in a polymeric matrix of Azivash gum-PVA was performed via electrospinning. According to ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, loading of catechin into nanofibers caused some interactions between catechin and polymer solution; also catechin improved the thermal stability of generated nanofibers. In gastrointestinal simulation media. about half of the total catechin released in SGF; however in SIF, about 15% of the remaining catechin was released during 6 h, and the residual catechin was released from nanofibers structure at longer times in intestine. In high-fat food simulant, the release rate was two times slower than low-fat food simulant, due to differences in polarity values of two media. To sum up, electrospun nanofibers containing catechin can be suggested as an active coating on the surface of polymers to prevent oxidation of sensitive bioactive compounds in foods or applied in the pharmaceutical sector."
