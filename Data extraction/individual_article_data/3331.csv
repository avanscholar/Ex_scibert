0,Introduction,"The Fuel Cell technology and the utilization of Hydrogen as energy carrier have been signed as one of the most promising alternatives for fossil fuels substitution in growing motive and industrial park [1,2]. In addition, Fuel Cells are more energy efficient than internal combustion engines [3]. While oil and natural gas are the main current sources of hydrogen, alcohols have attracted some attention in recent years, specially ethanol [4–7]. Considering alcohols utilization for H2 production by Steam Reforming, the natural progression in alcohol structure and complexity is proposed in Fig. 1 . In this sequence, the final goal would be the direct use of vegetal carbohydrates, like glucose, avoiding intermediates for H2 production. Ethanol, which can be used for renewable production of H2 by Steam Reforming, is being used directly in combustion engines as part of the fuel mixture [8]. Although the direct use of ethanol in motor is not recommended [9], because of the presence of undesirable organic compounds in bioethanol production output, the world demand for this product will grow [5], increasing its price. On the other hand, glycerol is obtained as a byproduct of biodiesel production in the approximate proportion of 10% of initial oil used. For this reason its global availability is increasing over the years, giving a first incentive for industrial use. Additionally, pure glycerol is a poor fuel and cannot be burned directly in internal combustion engines [10]. Thus, glycerol appears as an alternative for replacement of ethanol in H2 renewable production by Steam Reforming. The stoichiometry of reaction can be summarized in the following equation [11], by Oxidative Steam Reforming (OSR): (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 ( l ) + ( 3 − 2 x ) H 2 O ( l ) + x O 2 ( g ) → 3 CO 2 ( g ) + ( 7 − 2 x ) H 2 ( g ) Δ H 0 = 346.5 − 571.7 x [ kJ / mol ] where x is the molar O2/C3H8O3 ratio, abbreviated as O/G ratio; and H2O/C3H8O3 ratio, as S/G ratio (Steam to Glycerol). In the OSR system, endothermic or exothermic conditions can be modulated by adjusting the O/G ratio, which also determine the stoichiometric S/G ratio. ΔH 0 for global reaction moves from 346.5 [kJ/mol], at O/G = 0, to −82.3 [kJ/mol], at O/G = 0.75. In relation to overall thermodynamics, the energy system is neutral when x = 0.61 in the above equation. The operation at this point is called Autothermal Reforming (ATR). If no O2 is added the reaction system is called Steam Reforming (SR) of Glycerol. The carbonic solid formation has to be avoided because of catalyst deactivation, so its representation becomes important. There are publications on Thermodynamics of SR and OSR systems of Glycerol that do consider the formation of solid carbon deposits, but these are represented exclusively as Graphite [12–14], while others include only gaseous species [15,16]. But Graphite is not the only possible structure for the carbonaceous deposits, since the presence of Amorphous carbon deposits has been reported in Reforming systems [17–19]. Also Carbon Nanotubes have been detected over Reforming catalyst [20–22], which production is favored at high temperatures [23]. The structure of carbonaceous deposits formed in a catalytic process depends on reaction pathway, catalyst characteristics and reaction conditions. According to these specifications, in a catalytic process is possible to obtain various types of carbonaceous deposits, that differ in morphology and reactivity [19,24,25]. A study developed over Ni catalyst has shown five types of carbon deposits [23]. The use of Graphite thermodynamic properties for the whole carbonaceous deposits representation can be, then, considered incomplete. The representation of those deposits and the gases evolved in reaction system can be adequately constructed based on their thermodynamic properties [26–28]. Through thermodynamic analysis the effect of CO2 sorbents in the Reforming system can also be analyzed to quantify how CO2 sorption would shift the equilibrium to products. Up to now, the thermodynamic equilibrium has been calculated with the inclusion of CaO [29], but the use of Hydrotalcites could be attractive because its maximum sorption capacity is given at lower temperatures [30,31]. This work analyzes the thermodynamic equilibrium composition of Oxidative Steam Reforming of Glycerol, considering an extended representation of carbon deposits, including Graphite, Nanotubes, Amorphous and Polymeric carbon. The analysis also includes the use of Hydrotalcites as sorbent of CO2."
1,Methodology,"For predicting the thermodynamic equilibrium composition by minimization of the Gibbs free energy function, the expression given in Equation (2) has to be minimized. (2) G = ∑ i = 1 N C g n i g ( μ i g , 0 + R T ln ( f ^ i ) ) + ∑ i = 1 N C s n i s μ i s , 0 In equation (2), NC g and NC s are the number of components in gas and solid phase, respectively; n i g , the number of moles of component i in gas phase; n i s , the number of moles of component i in solid phase; R, the gas constant in [J/mol K]; T, the temperature in [K]; f ^ i is the fugacity of component i in a multi-component solution (dimensionless); and μ i 0 = μ i 0 ( T ) is the chemical potential of species i at standard pressure, focusing on Enthalpy information [32]. (3) ( ∂ H ̲ i ∂ T ) P = c p i (4) ∂ ∂ T ( G ̲ i R T ) P = − H ̲ i R T 2 (5) G ̲ i = μ i The chemical potential can be calculated from equations (3)–(5), where G ̲ i is the partial molar Gibbs Free Energy; H ̲ i , the partial molar Enthalpy; and c p i , the heat capacity at constant pressure of component i [33–35]. (6) Z − 1 = P r T r ( B 0 + ω B 1 ) The fugacity ( f ^ i , where ^ denotes the estimation in a multi-component solution) was calculated under the assumption of real gases representation by a Virial Equation of State (VEOS) (equation (6)) [36] and excluding solid from the calculation of the gas molar fraction. In this equation, P r is the reduced pressure; T r, the reduced temperature; and ω, the acentric factor. (7) y i = n i g n gases (8) f ^ i = y i · P · ϕ ^ i In equation (7), n gases defines the total number of moles in gas phase; and, in equation (8), P is the dimensionless pressure (P eval/P std). (9) ϕ ^ i = ϕ i Equation (9) is the Lewis/Randall rule for an ideal solution model, and allows the calculation of fugacity coefficient of component i in the multi-component solution ( ϕ ^ i ) as the one for isolated species ( ϕ i ) . It can be calculated from equation (10). (10) ϕ i = exp ( y i P P c i T T c i ( B i 0 + ω B i 1 ) ) Equation (10) was derived from VEOS, where P c i is the dimensionless critical pressure of component i (Critical pressure/P std), while T c i and ωi are the critical temperature and the acentric factor of component i, respectively. Terms B i 0 and B i 1 were calculated from Pitzer correlation [36], available in equations (11) and (12). (11) B i 0 = 0.083 − 0.422 ( T T c i ) 1.6 (12) B i 1 = 0.139 − 0.172 ( T T c i ) 4.2 All the data for P c i , T c i , ω i , Δ G f i 0 , Δ H f i 0 and C 1 i to C 5 i (constants for polynomial expression of c p i ), required for the calculation of Gibbs free energy of gaseous species, were taken from international databases [26,27]. For graphite, nanotubes and amorphous carbon, Δ G f i 0 , Δ H f i 0 and c p i were calculated as in our previous work [37] from databases [38–40]. Polymeric carbon was represented as polyethylene, considered the simplest polymer, with less stringent formation conditions than polypropylene, for example. This allows to assume a more favorable Gibbs free energy of formation than other types of polymer. If the equilibrium composition contains polyethylene, then it would be possible to suggest the representation of other types of more complex polymers; if not, is not possible to have other types of polymer at thermodynamic equilibrium, sustained on its relative Gibbs free energies. The properties for polyethylene were taken from polymer thermodynamic data [41,42], fixing Δ G f Polyethylene 0 and Δ H f Polyethylene 0 as −2187.83 [J/mol] and 7117.56 [J/mol], respectively. For Hydrotalcites (Mg50) representation, Ficicilar and Dogu [31] suggested the general formula Mg2y Al2 (OH)4y , where y is 1.25 for Mg50, reaching a MgO:Al2O3 ratio of 1. The change in Hydrotalcites when CO2 is adsorbed can be represented by MgO ( s ) + CO 2 ( g ) ⇄ MgCO 3 ( s ) . So Δ G f i 0 , Δ H f i 0 and c p i for these solids were taken from databases [28]. The CO2 sorption capacity for Hydrotalcites was included as an upper bound for the yield of sorbent-CO2 complex. The considered sorption capacity depends on temperature, as shown in Fig. 2 . The mass of Hydrotalcites included in the different calculations is such that the adsorption of the entire stoichiometric production of CO2 at maximum sorption capacity of Hydrotalcites (430 °C) is possible. The process of CO2 adsorption on Hydrotalcites was represented up to 450 °C, where Hydrotalcites-like structures are destroyed [43]. The effect of CO2 sorption on thermodynamic equilibrium composition was also analyzed for a more common CaO sorbent. CaO sorption capacity also varies with temperature [44,45], and the considered variation is available in Fig. 2. Similarly to CO2 sorption on Hydrotalcites, the adsorption on CaO was represented as formation of CaCO3, and the mass of CaO was such that allows the adsorption of the entire production of CO2 at the maximum sorption capacity of CaO (700 °C). CaO and CaCO3 thermodynamic properties were taken from databases [28]. Therefore, 3 alternatives for CO2 sorption were considered for the Glycerol Reforming systems: no sorbent, Hydrotalcites sorbent and CaO sorbent. All calculations were performed in GNU Octave [46] with QtOctave editor [47] following an algorithm for discrete nonlinear minimization detailed elsewhere [37]. A set of 35 molecules were considered as possible species: • Gases: glycerol, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, isopropyl methyl ether, propane, propene, propadiene, allyl alcohol, propionic acid, acrylic acid, methyl ethyl ether, n-propion aldehyde and acrolein. • Solids: graphite, carbon nanotubes, amorphous carbon, polyethylene, magnesium oxide and magnesium carbonate (last two for the representation of CO2 sorption with Hydrotalcites), calcium oxide and calcium carbonate (last two for the representation of CO2 sorption with CaO). The atomic balance and non-negative constraints were included as in a previous work [37], and all calculations were performed at atmospheric pressure."
2,Results,
3,Extended carbon deposits representation,"3.1 Extended carbon deposits representation The composition of gases and solids at thermodynamic equilibrium depends on the system conditions (Temperature, S/G ratio and O/G ratio). When all carbon deposits are represented as Graphite, the formation of carbonaceous solids appears to be favored below 700 °C and S/G ratio under 4.0 (Fig. 3a), when no Oxygen is present. When O/G ratio grows, all carbon formation regions are included in those margins. The extended carbon deposits representation reveals the existence of two regions: below 450 °C the most favorable carbonaceous solid type is graphite (Fig. 3b); and above, nanotubes (Fig. 3c). This boundary moves to lower temperatures (425 °C), when S/G ratio grows over 3.0 (Fig. 4a). With the extended representation, the equilibrium composition for carbon deposits shows higher values than the composition calculated with only graphite. Is possible to note this difference in Fig. 4a above 450 °C, in carbon nanotubes region, for S/G ratios below 3.0. So, the yield for carbonaceous solids at thermodynamic equilibrium is higher than calculated up to now for Steam Reforming of Glycerol above 450 °C. Consequently, the H2 yield is usually overestimated when only graphite is considered. This is confirmed in Fig. 4b, where the difference in carbon deposits yield leads to lower Hydrogen, Carbon monoxide and Carbon dioxide yields between 450 °C and 600 °C, and higher Methane yields in the same region. With the data used in his work, there is no formation of Amorphous or Polymeric carbon (represented as polyethylene) at thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, it is likely that amorphous carbon formation reported on Glycerol Reforming catalysts can be related with the kinetics of carbon deposition far from equilibrium."
4,Hydrotalcites effect,"3.2 Hydrotalcites effect The removal of a product from a reaction system shifts the equilibrium conversion to the products side. Hydrotalcites can be used for CO2 sorption, but its sorption capacity varies with temperature [30,31]. If this behavior is incorporated in thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, then is expected to obtain higher yields for H2, the non-sorbed product, where CO2 sorption is maximum. A zero CO2 yield shifts the H2 equilibrium yield from 6.0 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] , for the no sorbent case, to 7.0 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] , as can be seen in Fig. 5 . Those two distinct maximums are achieved at different conditions: when CO2 is adsorbed with Hydrotalcites, the maximum yield of H2 is achieved between 375 °C and 450 °C and above a S/G ratio of 3.0 (stoichiometric); and without sorbents, at 600 °C and a S/G ratio of 10.0. Then, the maximum yield of H2 is 7.0 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] , and it is achieved between 375 °C and 450 °C when Hydrotalcites are present, within the region of maximum CO2 sorption (350 °C–450 °C) (Fig. 5b). It is interesting to note that maximum H2 yield is obtained within a temperature range, and not exclusively at 430 °C, where the sorption capacity of Hydrotalcites is maximum. This behavior is caused by the variation of CO2 equilibrium yield with temperature. In the case that no sorbent is present, the CO2 production is continuously increasing until the maximum yield reached at 500 °C (Fig. 6a). Whereas, if sorption on Hydrotalcites is considered, the total sorption capacity of the mass of sorbent is enough to remove completely the CO2 from the gas mixture between 350 °C and 450 °C (and not only at 430 °C), as can be seen in Fig. 6b. In must be noted that below 350 °C, CO2 sorption is not thermodynamically favorable, as can be demonstrated comparing the respective regions in Fig. 6. The effect of CO2 sorption with Hydrotalcites in carbon deposits equilibrium composition is shown in Fig. 7 . As in no sorbent case, Graphite formation is favorable below S/G ratio of 4.0, when O/G ratio is 0, and all other formation boundaries (for other O/G ratios) are included in this first interval. But the upper bound for Graphite formation region related with temperature is different when CO2 sorption changes: in no sorbent case, Graphite formation is favorable up to 450 °C (Fig. 3b), but when CO2 sorption with Hydrotalcites is incorporated, Graphite formation is favored only up to 350 °C (Fig. 7a). This effect matches with CO2 sorption profile just analyzed. Then CO2 and Graphite are both unfavorable between 350 °C and 450 °C when Hydrotalcites-like sorbent is incorporated, region where the formation of sorbent + CO2 complex becomes favorable. The effect of CO2 sorption with Hydrotalcites on carbon nanotubes profile includes only the 450 °C isothermal cut. At this temperature, carbon nanotubes formation is favorable when no CO2 sorbent is present (Fig. 3c), but unfavorable when Hydrotalcites are included in the system (Fig. 7b). The thermodynamic influence of Hydrotalcites on Glycerol Reforming systems can be compared with CaO. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , the maximum H2 yield for CaO sorbent systems is 6.85 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] , and is achieved at 600 °C and S/G = 10.00, when O/G ratio is set as 0. In conclusion, the equilibrium yield for H2 can be maximized by the use of Hydrotalcites as CO2 sorbent. This maximum has a higher value than that for H2 yield in CaO sorbent system, and is obtained at lower temperature: 350 °C–450 °C for Hydrotalcites, instead of 600 °C for CaO sorbent system (see Fig. 8). In both cases the H2 equilibrium yield is higher than that in the no sorbent system, in agreement with the expected shift in global reaction."
5,Oxygen effect,"3.3 Oxygen effect Oxygen is used in Reforming processes for avoiding carbon deposition and improving energetic sustainability of the whole process, sacrificing to some extent the H2 yield. The use of Oxygen also modifies the equilibrium composition. Fig. 9 shows the Hydrogen yield with CO2 sorption with Hydrotalcites at 375 °C, for various O/G and S/G ratios. Taking into account the stoichiometric relation between Glycerol, Oxygen and Water exposed in Eq. (1), Fig. 9 shows that the growth of S/G ratio from stoichiometric does not affect the Hydrogen yield, when Hydrotalcites are present. This behavior is different from that of no sorbent systems (Fig. 5a), where the S/G ratio over stoichiometry does modify the Hydrogen yield. Then, to study the effect of O/G ratio on the equilibrium of Glycerol Reforming when Hydrotalcites are present, S/G ratio should be stoichiometric at least. Thus, in the following analysis, S/G ratio has been set as stoichiometric for each O/G ratio, following Eq. (1). This means that as O/G ratio increases (x value in Eq. (1)) the S/G ratio decreases according to the stoichiometric coefficient 3 − 2x. This setting allows to study the effect of O/G ratio without dealing with water lack nor excess, optimizing the water content. The chosen S/G and O/G ratios are informed in Fig. 9, where stoichiometric S/G and O/G ratios for analysis are tabulated and marked with arrows. Fig. 10 is a representation of minimum S/G ratio required for maximum H2 yield as a function of O/G, at various temperatures. The maximum value of Hydrogen yield obtained at equilibrium is informed as a label next to each point. The temperatures chosen in this figure are related with the activity of Hydrotalcites: at 350 °C Hydrotalcites are active, but at equilibrium there is no CO2 capture (Fig. 6b), because it is thermodynamically not favorable; at 375 °C Hydrotalcites are active, the sorption of CO2 is favorable and the sorption capacity of Hydrotalcites is enough for capturing all the CO2 from equilibrium (as mentioned before, this complete CO2 capture from equilibrium remains constant up to 450 °C); and at 500 °C Hydrotalcites are not active, due to the destruction of its structure, so CO2 sorption profile returns to non sorbent conditions. Fig. 10 shows that above 500 °C, where Hydrotalcites structure is destroyed, the increase of the S/G ratio over the stoichiometric value can improve the yield of H2 up to a value of 5.42 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] , but is not possible to reach the maximum theoretical yield, 7.0 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] . This value is only available for no oxygen systems (O/G = 0), when Hydrotalcites are used as CO2 sorbents, within the temperature range between 375 °C and 450 °C. As expected, Hydrogen yield shows a decrease when O/G ratio grows, as shown in Fig. 11 , linked with a shift to exothermic conditions as ΔH 0 for global reaction moves from 346.5 [kJ/mol], at O/G = 0, to −82.3 [kJ/mol], at O/G = 0.75. Is important to note that a growth in O/G ratio is linked with a decrease in S/G ratio, given the stoichiometric proportion herein maintained. It is, then, reasonable to obtain less H2 yield with higher O/G ratio, because there are less water molecules in the system (and therefore initially less Hydrogen atoms in the system). In the absence of CO2 sorbents the maximum H2 yield is 4.86 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] for O/G = 0. Upon an increase of oxygen concentration this yield decreases even further, reaching a maximum H2 yield of 3.74 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] for O/G = 0.75 at 600 °C and stoichiometric S/G ratio. Even though, in presence of the CO2 sorbent, an increase of the O/G ratio also affects the H2 yield, by using Hydrotalcites the H2 yield can be maintained above 5.5 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] even for high oxygen concentration (O/G = 0.75). Specifically, Hydrotalcites addition could compensate the loss in H2 yield associated with the growth of the O/G ratio (Fig. 11), keeping its equilibrium value above 5.5 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] when the O/G ratio is below 0.75 and the temperature is between 350 °C and 450 °C, as seen in Fig. 11b. H2 maximum yield obtained at O/G = 0.75 when Hydrotalcites are present (Fig. 11b) is higher than the maximum yield for H2 at O/G = 0 without CO2 sorbent (Fig. 11a). Finally, the effect of the O/G ratio on the carbon containing species profile can be seen in Fig. 12 . An increase of the O/G ratio, with a stoichiometric water concentration, leads to a raise in carbon deposits equilibrium yield. This behavior is related with the formation or disappearance of the other C-containing gases (Fig. 12): CO and CH4 yields decrease with O/G ratio growth, while CO2 increases its equilibrium yield. Thus, an O/G ratio growth, linked with a stoichiometric S/G ratio decrease, shifts the global equilibrium, making more favorable the formation of highly oxidized products (CO2). These changes also affect the formation of hydrogenated products (H2 and CH4). It must be noted that all these effects can be avoided between 350 °C and 450 °C if Hydrotalcites are used as CO2 sorbents. Specifically, between 375 °C and 450 °C, there is no other product gases at thermodynamic equilibrium than H2, and there is no carbon deposits, as can be seen in Figs. 11b and 12."
6,Conclusion,"Traditional representation of carbon deposits for thermodynamic study of Glycerol Reforming system includes only graphite. This is an incomplete representation, since more types of carbonaceous solids have been reported. The extended representation of carbon deposits reveals the existence of two regions: below 450 °C the most favorable carbonaceous solid type is graphite; and above, carbon nanotubes. There is no Amorphous or Polymeric carbon (represented as polyethylene) at equilibrium, no matter what temperature, S/G or O/G ratio is chosen. The use of CO2 sorbents in SR and OSR of Glycerol shifts the equilibrium to products, increasing H2 yield. In those systems where Hydrotalcites were included as CO2 sorbent, H2 yield is maximized between 350 °C and 450 °C, while for CaO sorbent the maximization of H2 yield is given at 600 °C. The maximum for Hydrotalcites system is also higher, reaching 7 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] for O/G = 0 and S/G ratio above 3.0, against 6.85 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] for CaO system and 6.0 [ mol H 2 / mol Glycerol ] for no sorbent system, both at same O/G ratio and S/G = 10.0. For all O/G ratios, when Hydrotalcites were used for CO2 sorption the results show higher H2 yields than CaO and no sorbent systems, and those values were available at lower S/G ratios and lower temperatures. The addition of oxygen favors the energetic sustainability of the whole process, but affects H2 formation. An increase of the O/G ratio, with a stoichiometric S/G ratio, shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to CO2 formation, making less favorable the formation of H2, CH4 and CO, and more favorable the formation of carbon deposits, as a consequence of minor C-containing gases yield. This trend can be avoided between 375 °C and 450 °C by using Hydrotalcites as CO2 sorbent, as no CO2, CO, CH4 nor carbon deposits are observed at thermodynamic equilibrium, and H2 yield is maximized. From the thermodynamic analysis, once the O/G ratio has been chosen according to energetic considerations, it is advisable to carry out the Glycerol Reforming reaction with at least a stoichiometric S/G ratio, the addition of enough mass of Hydrotalcites for total CO2 sorption and a temperature between 375 °C and 450 °C. Those conditions maximize the H2 yield with no other product gases or carbonaceous solids."
