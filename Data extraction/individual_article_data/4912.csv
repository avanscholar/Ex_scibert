0,Introduction,"Secondary and tertiary amines are important organic materials and intermediates and are extensively used in the pharmaceutical, pesticide, and chemical industries [1]. Generally, secondary and tertiary amines can be synthesized by (1) amination of primary or secondary amines with organic halides [2], (2) reduction of imines [3], (3) reductive amination of aldehydes or ketones with amines under high-pressure-hydrogen reaction conditions [4], and (4) hydrogenating amination of alkynes or alkenes with primary or secondary amines [5]. Amination uses expensive raw materials such as iodides and bromides, exhibits low selectivities for and yields of the desired products, and may produce many halide salt wastes. The reduction of imines uses NaBH4 or H2 as the reducing agent. Reductive amination of amines with aldehydes or ketones requires high-pressure H2. The harsh reaction conditions pose safety risks, and careful operation and special equipment are needed. Hydrogenating amination uses metal complexes as catalysts. The complex operating conditions and low product selectivity and yield are not suitable for industrial applications. Recently, N-alkylation of amines with alcohols catalyzed by transition-metal complexes through a borrowing hydrogen (BH) strategy, in which the only by-product is water, has attracted wide attention and could be an alternative to the traditional syntheses of secondary and tertiary amines [6–8]. This method meets the requirements of cleaner production and might have potential industrial applications. However, transition-metal complex catalysts, such as Ru [9], Rh [10], Ir [11], Ni [12], and Cu [13] complexes, are relatively expensive and difficult to separate and recover. Research on the heterogeneous catalysts for N-alkylation of amines with alcohols has been performed and reported [14]. In our previous work [15,16], we reported for the first time that heterogeneous bimetallic Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts can catalyze N-alkylation of amines with alcohols to give the corresponding secondary and tertiary amines through the BH strategy. The effects of Pt loading and reaction conditions such as solvent, temperature, and substituent were also reported [14]. The carriers are very important for supported heterogeneous catalysts in terms of active component loading and dispersion. The pore structure, physicochemical adsorption properties, and acid-base characteristics of the supports can also affect the heterogeneous catalytic reaction. In this study, N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol to produce N-phenylbenzylamine over three different types of alumina-supported Pt-Sn catalysts was used as a model heterogeneous catalytic reaction. The main object is to investigate the effect of alumina on the catalytic performance of the green synthesis of secondary amines by N-alkylation of amines with alcohols based on the BH Strategy over supported Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Three types of Al2O3 supports (denoted by Al2O3-A, Al2O3-B, and Al2O3-C) with different surface structures and physicochemical properties were used to prepare the catalysts. Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared using the vacuum complex impregnation technique [17]. The weighed Al2O3 support was placed in a vacuum impregnation flask and continuously degassed for 30 min to remove the physically adsorbed gases and impurities on the surface and in the pores of the carriers. H2PtCl6, SnCl2, HCl, and H2O in certain proportions were stirred and mixed in a separating funnel by a N2 flow of purity greater than 99.995%, and then sprayed onto the alumina support in the impregnation flask. After impregnation for 30 min, the samples were kept under vacuum at 60–70 °C for 30 min, and then dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 520 °C for 8 h in air. The calcined samples were finally reduced at 470 °C for 4 h in a tube furnace using H2 of purity greater than 99.99%. The corresponding Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were denoted by Cat-A, Cat-B, and Cat-C. Because the densities of the Al2O3 supports were different, the Pt contents of the catalysts were adjusted to ensure that catalysts of the same volume loaded into the reactor had the same total amount of Pt. The components of the catalysts are listed in Table 1 ."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface areas of the alumina supports were determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 physical adsorption instrument. Samples were degassed for 2 h at 200 °C in a volumetric adsorption system. N2 adsorption was undertaken at −196 °C. The specific surface areas were calculated using the BET equation. The total pore volumes of the alumina supports were measured using a Micromeritics Autopore 9520 mercury porosimeter. A mercury contact angle of 130° and a mercury interfacial tension of 485 dyne/cm were used to calculate pore size distribution data from the mercury intrusion-extrusion curves. The crystallinities of the alumina supports were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max-γB powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2θ scanning range 10°–80°. The morphologies of the alumina supports were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2000 EX transmission electron microscope. The acceleration voltage was 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the alumina supports was performed using a Quanta 200F scanning electron microscope. The acceleration voltage was 20 kV. The Pt dispersions of the catalysts were measured using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemical adsorption instrument. The samples were reduced under H2 at 500 °C for 1 h and then purged under He at 520 °C for 1 h. CO pulse adsorption experiments were performed at 50 °C. A 5% CO/He mixed gas (0.1 ml) was sent to the reactor; the pulse interval time was 4 min. Pt dispersion was calculated based on the amount of adsorbed CO. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalysts was performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus. The samples were pretreated in Ar at 120 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the gas flow was switched to a 10% H2/Ar mixed gas. The samples were then heated to 500 °C with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min. A TCD was used to determine H2 consumption. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were performed using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus. The samples were pretreated under He at 500 °C for 1 h. After cooling to 100 °C, NH3 was adsorbed. The pulse volume was 0.2 ml and the pulse interval time was 4 min, until saturation of NH3 adsorption. The samples were then heated to 600 °C with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min. The desorbed NH3 was detected by online quadruple mass spectrometry."
4,Catalytic activity tests,"2.3 Catalytic activity tests The catalytic N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol to produce N-phenylbenzylamine was performed in a fixed-bed micro-reactor. The weighed catalysts (3 ml), with particle sizes of 12–18 mesh, were charged into the reactor. The reactor was filled with small silica balls on top of the catalyst bed. A mixture of benzyl alcohol and aniline in a molar ratio of 1:1 and with a total flow rate of 3 ml/h, and pure H2 with a flow rate of 100 ml/min, were mixed and sent to the reactor. The reaction temperature and the reaction pressure were controlled at 240 °C and 0.1 MPa, respectively. The products were cooled by passing them through a condenser and they were collected in a gas-liquid separator. The liquid products were removed every 4 h and analyzed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph. The selectivity for N-phenylbenzylamine was defined as the percentage of N-phenylbenzylamine in the total products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of alumina supports,"3.1 Characterization of alumina supports The XRD patterns of the three types of alumina supports are shown in Fig. 1 . The peaks at 2θ = 19.2°, 37.36°, 39.48°, 45.84°, and 66.96°, with d values of 0.4599, 0.2392, 0.2279, 0.1975, and 0.1396 nm, are assigned to the (111), (311), (222), (400), and (440) planes of cubic γ-Al2O3, respectively (JCPD 04-0858). This indicates that the three types of alumina supports are γ-Al2O3. The TEM images of the three types of alumina supports are presented in Fig. 2 . The ordered channels of Al2O3-A and the disordered structures of Al2O3-B and Al2O3-C can be observed in the TEM images. Al2O3-B is composed of random stack-like or cotton-like particles, and Al2O3-C is mainly built from needle-like or rod-like particles. The SEM images of the three types of alumina supports are displayed in Fig. 3 . It shows the presence of large numbers of macropores and micropores in Al2O3-A and Al2O3-C, while Al2O3-B has a microporous structure. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the alumina supports are presented in Fig. 4 . The isotherms of the alumina supports are type IV. The hysteresis loop features of Al2O3-A, in which the adsorption and desorption branches remain nearly parallel and horizontal over a wide range of partial pressures, are type H4, according to the IUPAC classification. This type of material often has narrow slit-shaped pores. Al2O3-B exhibits an H2-type hysteresis loop characteristic of solids consisting of ink bottle pores whose pore network structure may be independent. The hysteresis loop features of Al2O3-C are H1-type, which is often associated with mesoporous or macroporous structures with cylindrical pores, and the pore network structure may be connected. The mercury intrusion pore size distribution curves of the alumina supports are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that Al2O3-B has a unimodal pore structure with the pore size distribution centered in the mesoporous range, i.e., below 10 nm. Al2O3-A and Al2O3-C exhibit bimodal pore structures; the mesoporous pore size distributions are centered at 5 and 15 nm, respectively, and the macroporous ones are centered at 800 and 1300 nm, respectively. The BET surface areas, pore volumes, and pore size distributions of the three alumina supports are listed in Table 2 . It can be seen that Al2O3-B has the largest surface area (244.8 m2/g) and the smallest pore volume (0.37 ml/g). For the Al2O3-A and Al2O3-C supports, with bimodal pore structures, Al2O3-A has a larger surface area and smaller pore volume. Based on these results, it can be deduced that the surface areas of the alumina supports are mainly affected by mesopores, whereas the total pore volume is mainly affected by macropores."
7,Characterization of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts The Pt dispersions of the three Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Table 1. The Pt dispersion of Cat-A is 71.7%. Cat-B has the lowest Pt dispersion, only 38.0%. Although Al2O3-C has the smallest BET surface area and the Pt content of Cat-C is 2.5 times that of the other two catalysts, the Pt dispersion of Cat-C is still the highest, 93.9%. This indicates that the specific surface areas of the alumina supports might not be the main factor affecting Pt dispersion of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. The surface structures and acidic characteristics of the alumina supports can also affect Pt dispersion of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts [18]. The TPR profiles of the three Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . The TPR profiles of Cat-A, Cat-B, and Cat-C exhibit a large reduction peak at 200–400 °C, with maximum peak temperatures (T M) of 280, 255, and 220 °C, respectively. This peak is attributed to the reduction of Pt oxide [19]. The small shoulder in the TPR profiles of the three Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts at 350–400 °C is generally assigned to reduction of SnO x that interacts with Pt [19]. The TPR profile of Cat-B also has one large temperature reduction peak between 450 and 500 °C, which may correspond to the reduction of SnO x interacting with Al2O3 [20]. It can be speculated, based on the differences among the T M values of the first reduction peak of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, that the interactions of Pt with Al2O3-C or SnO x -Al2O3-C are weaker than those for the other two catalysts. SnO x in Cat-B is more easily reduced and forms a Pt-Sn alloy with Pt, which may be one reason why Cat-B exhibits the lowest Pt dispersion although Al2O3-B has the highest specific surface area. The NH3-TPD profiles of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The NH3-TPD profiles of the three catalysts show a large desorption peak at 150–250 °C and a shoulder at 250–450 °C, indicating that the acidity distributions of the three catalysts are relatively broad. The deconvoluted peaks of the NH3-TPD curves, using the Gaussian deconvolution method, are shown in Fig. 7, and the multipeak fitting results are collected in Table 3 . It can be inferred from the total NH3 desorption peak area that the order of the total acid contents of the three catalysts are Cat-B > Cat-A > Cat-C. Based on Narayanan's [21] definition of catalyst acidity, the acid distribution of Cat-A is similar to that of Cat-C and is related to medium and strong acidic centers; for Cat-B, strong acidic centers are essential."
8,Catalytic reaction performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.3 Catalytic reaction performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts The conversions of aniline over different Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 8(a) . In a continuous run of the N-alkylation reaction, the conversion of aniline gradually increased and nearly stabilized after 20 h. After reaction for 20 h, the conversions of aniline over Cat-A and Cat-B were 26.8% and 17.3%, respectively. The conversion of aniline over Cat-C was 82.4%, much higher than those over Cat-A and Cat-B. After 56 h, the conversions of aniline over Cat-A, Cat-B, and Cat-C were 27.2%, 13.7%, and 79.6%, respectively. Cat-A and Cat-C showed very good stability, whereas the activity of Cat-B decreased rapidly. Compared with the conversion of aniline over Cat-B for a reaction time of 20 h, the aniline conversion decreased by nearly 21% when the reaction was run for 56 h. The selectivities for N-phenylbenzylamine over different Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 8(b). During reaction for 56 h, the selectivities for N-phenylbenzylamine over Cat-A, Cat-B, and Cat-C were relatively stable, and the average N-phenylbenzylamine selectivities were 98.0%, 92.3%, and 95.4%, respectively."
9,Discussion,"3.4 Discussion In the BH strategy, the N-alkylation of amines and alcohols proceeds as follows. First, alcohols are dehydrogenated over the catalyst to form the more reactive aldehydes and H2. Then a condensation reaction takes place between the aldehydes and amines to form imines, with water as the only by-product. Finally, the imines are hydrogenated by H2 formed in situ to yield secondary amines. This mechanism was proved in our previous study [14]. The reaction products of benzyl alcohol over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts under the same reaction conditions were analyzed in this research. It was found that benzyl alcohol was almost completely converted to benzaldehyde, dibenzyl ether, and toluene. Benzaldehyde is the product of dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol [22], dibenzyl ether is the product of intramolecular dehydration of benzyl alcohol [23], and toluene is formed by hydrogenation/dehydration of benzyl alcohol [24]. In the initial stage of the reaction of benzyl alcohol over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, a large amount of toluene was detected in the products. As the reaction proceeded, the toluene generation gradually decreased. Most of the benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde after more than 10 h. Thus, after prolonged reaction, more benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde, which underwent condensation with aniline. This process also explains the finding that the aniline conversion over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts gradually increased after 12 h. The aniline conversion over Cat-A was higher than that over Cat-B. This is accounted for by the higher Pt dispersion of Cat-A compared with that of Cat-B. It was also found that Pt-Sn alloy formation on Cat-B is unfavorable for the N-alkylation reaction. Cat-C has the highest catalytic activity, and this may be the result of many factors. On the one hand, Cat-C has the highest Pt dispersion. The dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol occurs more easily on smaller Pt particles of Pt-Sn/Al2O3. On the other hand, Al2O3-C has the largest pore volume and diameter. The large pore volume and pore size distribution help the adsorption of benzyl alcohol and aniline and the desorption of the reaction product, N-phenylbenzylamine. The weak interactions between Pt and Al2O3-C can also help the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. Cat-A and Cat-C showed very good stability up to 36 h after the reaction reached a steady state. The rapid deactivation of Cat-B might be related to its microporous structure. The pore size distribution of Al2O3-B is mainly centered at 5–6 nm. This is not favorable for desorption of products and their removal from the catalyst. In addition, the NH3-TPD results showed that the acidity of Cat-B was not only the highest but was also present mainly in medium-strong and strong acid sites, which are prone to coke reaction over catalysts and decrease the catalyst stability. The highest acidic characteristics of Cat-B also result in the lowest selectivity for the secondary amine. It was also confirmed in our previous report [14] that higher yields of secondary amines can be obtained over catalysts with weaker acidities."
10,Conclusions,"The physicochemical characteristics such as BET surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, and acidity of alumina supports affect the Pt dispersion, reduction of SnO x , interaction of Pt with the support, and acid distribution of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. The differences among the physicochemical characteristics of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts result in different catalytic performance in the synthesis of secondary amines by N-alkylation of amines and alcohols. Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with (i) highly dispersed Pt particles as the active component, (ii) relatively weak acid sites and acid distributions, and (iii) large pore volumes and pore size distributions give excellent catalytic performance in green catalytic synthesis of secondary amines and are promising for industrial applications."
