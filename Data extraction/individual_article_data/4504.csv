0,Introduction,"The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is an interesting reaction from both a scientific and economic point of view. Economically, unsaturated alcohols (UA) are widely used in perfumes, air fresheners, cosmetics, flavors and medicinal substances. Scientifically, the challenge is to control the reaction pathway with the aim to obtain selectively the derivative UA. The production of these compounds is not easy because the hydrogenation of the CC bond of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is kinetic and thermodynamically more favourable than the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group (CO). Moreover, others secondary reactions such as cyclization, isomerization or cracking can also take place decreasing the UA yield [1]. Heterogeneous catalysis is a powerful tool to reach this purpose. Nevertheless, in the presence of the most of conventional hydrogenation catalysts, the saturated alcohol or aldehyde is preferentially obtained [2]. Thus, large efforts have been carried out to optimize both the operational conditions and the catalyst characteristics [3]. In this sense, results do not depend only on the selection of the adequate combination of active phase and supports, but also on the pre-treatment undergone by the catalyst, defining the chemical nature, dispersion and interaction between both phases [4,5]. The catalytic performance, namely selectivity, is related with the different interaction, inducing different adsorption modes of the reactant molecules with the catalyst surface. Delbecq and Sautet [6] develops theoretical calculations about the adsorption of aldehyde molecules on Pt and Pd-particles. The adsorption mode di-σ is mainly favoured on the (111) plane, so that the hydrogenation of the CO is favoured depending on the substituent on the CC bond. This is also observed experimentally, so, in the hydrogenation of prenal (3-methyl-crotonaldehyde) in gas phase on Pt (111) at 80°C, 65% selectivity to unsaturated alcohols with 20% conversion is obtained [7] while on Pt (110) the main products were the saturated aldehyde or alcohol [8]. This is because the compact structure of the surface (111) induces a steric hindrance for the accommodation of the two methyl groups and therefore prevents the CC adsorption and activates the adsorption via CO bond. This suggests that the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol could be influenced by the proportion of (111) planes exposed on the surface, which is favoured by increasing the Pt-particle size. Consequently, the particle size of the active phase is a very important factor determining the selective hydrogenation of the CO group. However, in spite that this fact is commented along the extensive hydrogenation bibliography [9], there is any study clearly delimiting the influence of this parameter. In this manuscript, the influence of the Pt-particle size on the selective hydrogenation of citral has been analyzed. For that, a platinum catalyst was prepared on carbon xerogel microspheres and pretreated in different experimental conditions obtaining Pt-particle sizes ranging from 3 to 10nm."
1,Experimental,
2,Pt-catalyst preparation,"2.1 Pt-catalyst preparation A microporous carbon xerogel (X) was selected as support. The carbon xerogel was prepared according to previous works [10]. In brief, the method consists in the polycondensation of resorcinol (R) with formaldehyde (F) in aqueous media (W), with Cs2CO3 as polymerization catalyst (C) using a three-necks glass reactor provided of reflux, controlled temperature and stirring. The molar ratios of the mixture were R/F=1/2, R/W=3/500 and R/C=800. The gel was aged at 85°C for 24h, after which the suspension was filtered and placed in acetone to exchange water inside the pores. Finally, the gel was dried by microwave under nitrogen atmosphere and carbonized at 900°C in a 100cm3/min N2 flow. The carbon xerogel support was milled and sieved to a diameter smaller than 0.15mm and then, impregnated with an aqueous solution of [(Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 (reagent grade supplied by Aldrich) to obtain a 3wt.% metal loading. The catalyst was dried at 100°C overnight and kept in a desiccator until use. Before each catalytic experiment, a fraction of this sample was pretreated at progressively more severe pretreatment conditions (temperature between 300 and 400°C and time between 3 and 12h in He flow) in order to obtain different Pt-particle size (Table 1 ). Catalysts were referred indicating the support (X) followed by the active phase (Pt) and the Pt-particle size determined by H2-chemisorption. For example, XPt-8 is the catalyst with a 3wt.% Pt-loading supported on X carbon xerogel with a Pt particle size of 8nm after pre-treatment."
3,Characterization of support and catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of support and catalysts Textural characterization of support and catalysts was carried out by N2 and CO2 adsorption at −196°C and 0°C, respectively, using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 equipment. The BET surface area (SBET) was determined and Dubinin–Radushkevich equation applied to determine the micropore volume (W0), the mean micropore width (L0) and the microporous surface area (Smic) [11]. Furthermore, the BJH method was applied to the N2 desorption branch in order to calculate the mesopore volume of the samples (Vmeso) and pore size distributions [12]. Pt dispersion (D) and mean particle size (d) were obtained by H2-chemisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray difraccion. HRTEM experiments were carried out using a Phillips CM-20 microscope equipped with EDAX microanalysis system and microphotographs analyzed by the appropriate software (ImageJ). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The average Pt crystallite size was estimated by the application of the Debye-Scherer equation. The chemical characterization of the catalysts was further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The spectra were obtained on a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer connected to a detector DLD (delay-line detector)."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3 Catalytic performance The citral hydrogenation was carried out in 100ml heptane solution at a constant hydrogen pressure of 8.3bar and 90°C using a Parr reactor model 5500. The experimental conditions: citral concentration, catalyst weight and stirring speed were previously optimized in order to avoid mass transfer limitations and fixed in 0.05M, 500mg and 1500rpm, respectively. A small volume of sample (1mL) was periodically withdrawn and analyzed by chromatography using a Bruker 430-GC equipped with a FID detector and a Varian GC Capillary Column CP7485 (25m×0.32mm×0.45μm). Citral and any possible product were previously calibrated."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Textural and chemical characterization,"3.1 Textural and chemical characterization The textural characteristics of support and catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The corresponding N2 and CO2-adsorption isotherms are shown in Fig. S1. Both support and catalysts are exclusively microporous materials, being null the mesopore volume. Results point out the blockage of porosity by Pt-particles according the pretreatment (particle size attained). It is also noteworthy the complementary information obtained by N2 and CO2 adsorption. It is well known that the CO2 adsorption provides information about the narrow microporosity, corresponding to micropores with diameter lower than 0.7nm, while the total microporosity is obtained from N2 isotherm only in absence of diffusion restrictions [13]. In all cases, W0 (N2)<W0 (CO2), denoting that narrow micropores are predominant. Thus, the decrease of parameters determined from N2 adsorption (SBET, L0 and W0 (N2)) are stronger when smaller Pt-particles are obtained, while Smic, L0 and W0 (CO2) only decay after the more severe pretreatment conditions. The smaller Pt-particles could be localized inside or in the entrance of the wider micropores thus blocking porosity (W0 decreases and L0 (N2) increases). With increasing the Pt-particle size, the Pt-particles should be formed therefore outside micropores, thus SBET, L0 and W0 (N2) slowly increases again. XRD, TEM and H2-chemisorption techniques confirm, as expected, that larger pre-treatment and higher temperature provoke a greater sintering of metal particles (Table 2 ). This is clearly observed in the HRTEM images (Figs. 1 and S2) and the corresponding histograms (Fig. S3), which point out also that a homogeneus Pt-particle size distribution is obtained at 350°C while histograms present long tails with increasing the temperature of pretreatment. Regarding XRD analysis (Fig. 2 ), practically no Pt-peaks are observed in the XPt-3 pattern, due to the small Pt-particle size, while these peaks are more defined and intense in the sense XPt-5<XPt-8<XPt-10. In general, there is a good agreement between the mean particle size values obtained by H2 chemisorption and HRTEM, being that differences due to the characteristics of each technique; chemisorption is favoured on the smaller Pt-particles while with HRTEM, and mainly XRD, bigger particles are easily determined. The Pt chemical nature and surface content were determined by XPS. These results are collected in Table 3 . The surface Pt-content, % Ptxps >3%, confirming the localization of platinum on the external surface. Moreover, as expected, the % Ptxps decreases after more severe pretreatment conditions, confirming also the stronger sintering in this sense. A similar distribution of Pt species was found in all cases. A mixture of Pt0 and PtII is detected, although the proportion of Pt0 is slightly favoured in the more severe experimental conditions. The corresponding B.E. values only differ slightly, denoting also a similar Pt-support interaction."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance In previous manuscripts [10,14] we have evidenced the influence of support on the Pt-performance, mainly when reducible oxides (TiO2) were used [4], because of the beneficial contribution of oxygen vacancies. Using carbon supports [10], inorganic impurities and the presence of mesoporosity on carbon supports favour the development of secondary reactions such as cracking, progressive hydrogenation or cyclization, decreasing the UA yield. Thus, for this study we have selected a pure and exclusively microporous carbon xerogel as support to avoid chemical or porous interferences. The citral conversion values reached with this pure support was below 5%, being citronellal and citronellol the main products obtained. Changes on the activity and selectivity of catalyst should be therefore related with the different Pt-particle size, that according to the results commented above, is the unique important difference between catalysts. In Fig. 3 the influence of Pt particle size on the catalytic performance is shown. Both activity (conversion) and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols increase as the particle size increases up to 8nm and then decrease. Clearly, the optimal Pt particle size is determined at around 8nm. As described in the bibliography [7,8], the formation of compact crystallographic layers (111) is favoured with increasing the Pt-particle size, inducing the adsorption of the aldehyde molecules through the CO bond, and so an increase in SUA. Nevertheless, in this sense, the contrary tendency was expected for conversion data, due to the smaller number of Pt in surface (active sites). These results point out that the Pt-clusters should present a minimum particle size to be catalytically active in this reaction. On the other hand, small Pt-particles are quickly deactivated by CO chemisorption on atoms forming edges or corners, which are in large proportion in particles smaller than 3nm [15]. Thus, the activity detected for XPt-3, could be due mainly to the presence of some larger particles (with diameter 6–9nm) detected in this catalyst (Figs. S2 and S3). The proportion of particles at around 8nm progressively increases favoured by sintering, thus, conversion quickly increases from 17 to 61%, while a moderate SUA increase (58 to 77%) is detected in the same Pt-particle range (from XPt-3 to XPt-8). Thus, catalytic activity is more favoured than SUA in this particle range, i.e. UA yield increased in a greater proportion due to the greater activity than selectivity increase. Thus, the citral adsorption is enhanced, simultaneously favouring the CO orientation to the catalyst surface with increasing the particle size up to 8nm. In the more severe pretreatment conditions, in spite that the large part of particles remains bellow 8–10nm, there is however a progressively greater fraction of bigger particles, reaching many of them values close to 30nm. This strongly enhance the crystallinity of the Pt-particles (Fig. 2), hindering the catalytic performance. Again, conversion drops faster and deeply than SUA. Different causes can contribute to the low activity of both smaller and bigger particles. Thus, it was described that the adsorption of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde was hindered by a steric repulsion between the metal surface in large metal particles and the aldehyde molecule [16,17]. On the contrary, small particles are quickly deactivated by irreversible CO-adsorption [15]. Therefore, particle size influences both the extent and the adsorption mode. The interaction between the aldehyde molecule and the catalyst surface, and consequently the selectivity reached, is also determined by the molecule substituents [16]. In this sense, we must remember that citral is a mixture of cis/trans isomers; we have detected a proportion of 46.5% neral and 53.5% geranial in the commercial reactant used. When compare results obtained at isoconversion (26% of citral conversion), it was found that the conversion of geranial linearly increases with the particle size up to 8nm, while the contrary tendency was observed for neral conversion (Fig. 3b. This fact can be related with a smaller interaction of the latter with the catalyst surface due to the hindrance induced by the neighbour methyl groups, in agreement with previous studies [16]. The adsorption via CO is more favoured on geranial than in neral due to the better accesibility of this bond to the metal surface. Wu et al. [18] also pointed out that PtCo-catalysts functionalized with amines are more active in the hydrogenation of geranial than neral, based on the larger steric hindrance of neral. This fact is also confirmed by analyzing the product distribution obtained in each case (Fig. S4). The main products are UA, and the main UA formed is geraniol (Gol), independently of the Pt-particle size. SGol reached values around 50% after 6h of reaction, which together values around 30% for Nerol (SNol) leads to SUA close to 80%. These values are significantly high for monometallic Pt-catalyst. The hydrogenation of nerol and geraniol produces citronellol (Col), but it was also pointed out that the hydrogenation of geraniol is favoured versus nerol [19]. Moreover, it was also suggested that Pt-catalyst deactivation is due to the accumulation of trans-isomers (geranial and geraniol) [20]. Thus, the smaller nerol yield observed is not due to a deeper hydrogenation regarding geraniol or a more developed tendency to form coke-precursors, but to the smaller activity induced by it greater steric hindrance. At the reaction beginning however, the main product obtained is citronellal (Cal) reaching selectivity values between 50 and 70%, i.e. the CC adsorption sites are originally available and actives. This is favoured on the highly exposed Pt-surface atoms (edge and corners) of the small particles (XPt-3) as suggested by Delbecq [6], but also, on the biggest particles of XPt-10 by increasing repulsion between the molecule and the surface [15,16]. The SCal decreases in all the conversion range independently of the particle size, suggesting that citronellal is hydrogenated to citronellol. However, in the case of most selective catalysts XPt-5 and mainly XPt-8, citrollellol increases faster after intermediate conversion degrees, indicating that in these cases, also UA are hydrogenated to citronellol. An additional experiment was carried out in order to confirm this hypothesis. A new raw citral, purchased in this case enriched in geranial (65% geranial – 35% neral) is used with XPt-5 catalyst in the same experimental conditions. An increase in conversion (from 41 to 55%) and SUA (from 65 to 71%) is obtained, which confirm the influence of the molecular structure on the catalytic performance. Finally, we have compared the stability of the best catalysts obtained (XPt-5 and XPt-8) by analyzing the results obtained in a second reaction cycle (Fig. S5). In the first cycle, conversion values are quite similar during the first 2–3h of reaction, but after that, XPt-5 seems to be deactivated and conversion values do not increase significantly from 4h of reaction. Thus both conversion and selectivity values are higher at long reaction times using XPt-8 catalysts, suggesting a higher stability of this catalyt. However, when compare the results in a second reaction cycle both catalysts present the same behavior. In spite that UA are practically the only reaction product obtained conversion values are smaller than 10%."
8,Conclusions,"The influence of Pt particle size on the catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of citral is deeply studied. A pure and microporous carbon xerogel structured in microspheres was selected as support to avoid chemical and textural interferences in the catalytic performance. Pt-particle size varies from 3 to 10nm after pretreatment in progressively severe experimental conditions. Due to the microporous character of carbon xerogel support, Pt particles are localized on the external surface being therefore Pt-dispersion the only variable. Both activity (conversion) and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols increase as the particle size increases up to 8nm and then decrease. Clearly, the optimal Pt particle size is determined at around 8nm favouring in this sense the interaction of citral molecules through the CO bond. This interaction is also dependent of the cis/trans isomer ratio of the citral reactant, being geranial conversion favoured regarding the neral fraction."
