0,Introduction,"The heteropolyacids (HPAs) are solid superacids and efficient acidic catalysts in variety of processes [1,2]. Acidity of solid catalysts is a function of mobility of delocalized protons within the lattice. The H+ cations delocalization is a result of the negative charge being spread over either an entire lattice, like in zeolites, or its sizable components such as polyoxoanions in the heteropolyacids, or over a functional group, like in the alkylsulfonic groups grafted in the functionalized mesoporous materials [3,4]. The latter category has an advantage of its acidity being located mostly on the extended surface of the catalyst, rather than in its bulk, which enables variety of larger organic molecules to be used in heterogeneously catalyzed synthesis, without suffering from hindered accessibility of the acidic protons within the bulk. However, the organic part of sulfonic acid may be prone to degradation, thermal or chemical, which may have its bearing on the stability of the acid strength of such catalysts. In comparison, the acidity of heteropolyacids seems to be more robust and, on the other hand, the accessibility of protons in heteropolyacids can also be improved by their supporting on certain high surface area materials. Several methods have been proposed for measuring the acidity of solid catalysts, either directly, by using a base molecules as probes, often combined with the IR detection, or indirectly, by assessing the catalytic performance in appropriate test reactions using various microreactors usually combined with the gas chromatography (GC) detection. Table 1 presents the methods for the measuring of acidity of heteropolyacid catalysts. The direct methods measure a parameter that is representative of the catalyst acidity. Pyridine and NH3 are usually applied as probe molecules. The representative parameters include the position and/or intensity of the IR bands of adsorbed molecule, as well as the microcalorimetrically measured heat of the NH4 + cation formation. These methods are useful for arranging a series of catalysts into a sequence of increasing relative acidity. In case of heteropolyacids, the NH3 is most often applied as a probe molecule, due to its ability to penetrate HPA’s crystal lattice, rather than being limited to sorption only on the surface. However, a great care has to be taken to avoid, or to account for, a misleading effect of multiple sorption. The formation of a dimeric N2H7 + cation, instead of the NH4 +, artificially expands both the uptake of NH3 and the heat of its sorption [5,6]. Recently, using the FTIR method (1) with pyridine as a probe molecule for the heteropolyacids was described in [7,8]. The methanol and the isopropanol conversion are the most popular amongst the test reactions (method (2)). The dehydration of MeOH has been widely used as acidity test in the HPA-containing catalysts (such as phosphotungstic and tungstosilicic acids) supported on various materials, including MCM-41 [9], titanium oxide [10,11], montmorillonite K10 [12], aluminosilicate [13] and boron nitride [14], with the results compared to unsupported heteropolyacids. The dehydration of 2-propanol has also been used to assess the acidity of oxides [15] and of the oxide-supported heteropolyacids [16–18]. Turek et al. [10] tested a series of catalysts, including γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, H3PW12O40, and H3PMo12O40 and were able not only to distinguish the type of active sites, but also to determine their strength. Bond et al. [13] investigated the kinetics of isopropanol dehydration on a series of catalysts containing H3PW12O40, supported on oxides or otherwise, as well as the CsnH3-nPW12O40 salts, using the gas chromatography to monitor the reaction. They reported the variation of the turnover frequency to correlate with the acid strength, determined by NH3 adsorption calorimetry, decreasing in the order: H3PW12O40 > Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 > 15%H3PW12O40/SiO2 > 15%H3PW12O40/TiO2 > 15%H3PW12O40/Nb2O5 > 15%H3PW12O40/ZrO2. A more comprehensive correlation of this type has been recently reported in [1]. Lacerda et al. [19] pointed out that the yield of propylene, which is a product of isopropanol dehydration, was found to be directly related to the amount of Brønsted acid sites in the catalyst. The catalytic reactions usually involve the GC detection of products, imposing a choice of a flow-through, over a batch microreactor, to be applied in the tests. A possibility of using a batch microreactor combined with the GC is limited by intrinsic difficulties in sampling of the gas phase over the catalyst bed. In this paper we propose to use the FTIR spectroscopy for in situ monitoring of certain test reactions progress in a more direct way than the GC detection can usually offer. To this end, an IR environmental cell has been used as batch microreactor. The parameters of reaction progress, that is, the conversion degree and the yields of products, were derived from the IR-detected variations in the gas phase. The dehydrations of methanol and 2-propanol were applied as test reactions. The gas flow-through microcalorimetry was applied for acidity determination and the data have been used as benchmarks for the results of the catalytic tests. For the dehydration of 2-propanol the batch test results were also compared to the analogous results from GC-combined flow-through mode reactor."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and catalysts,"2.1 Chemicals and catalysts Methanol (anhydrous 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) and isopropyl alcohol (anhydrous, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as reagents in the catalytic tests, whereas propylene (≥99%, Aldrich), dimethyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich) and diisopropyl ether (analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich) were used in calibration procedures in the catalytic experiments. The Keggin-type heteropolyacid H3PW12O40 (PW), H3PMo12O40 (PMo) have been provided by Sigma-Aldrich p.p.a. The Wells-Dawson type H6P2W18O62 (P2W) were prepared in our lab according to our previous synthesis procedure [20]. The physicochemical properties of P2W have been listed in [12]. The Wells-Dawson H6P2Mo18O62 (P2Mo) was synthesized in our lab for the first time, partly following the procedure described in [21]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a X’Pert PRO MPD (Pananalytical) powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA). TG analyses were performed by a Netzsch STA 409 PC/PG derivatograph. The heating rate was 5 °C min−1. The FTIR Excalibur 300 Series Digilab spectrometer, equipped with DTGS detector, was used for both the catalysts characterizations and the measurements in the gas phase. For the catalyst characterizations, the samples were prepared by KBr technique and silicon wafer technique [22]. The spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. The IR spectra of gaseous phase over the catalysts upon interaction with alcohols were recorded at increasing temperature (60–140 °C). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image was recorded by JEOL JSM-7500 F field-emission apparatus operated at 15 kV and coupled with EDS microanalysis. The microcalorimetric experiments were performed using a Microscal FMC 4110 microcalorimeter, described in [23]. Catalysts testing by gas chromatography in 2-propanol conversion in gas phase was carried out in a flow microreactor (Ø = 10 mm). The helium carrier gas was saturated with 2-propanol at r.t. The hydrated samples of catalysts were diluted with 0.2 g quartz grains (Ø = 0.19 mm) and preheated in situ in the reactor (helium flow rate 30 cm3 min−1) at 180 °C for 40 min. The weight of catalyst samples was adjusted in such way that it always contained 0.1 g of anhydrous HPA. The flow rate of reaction mixture was 23 cm3 min−1. The catalytic reactor was connected on-line with Perkin-Elmer AutoSystem XL Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Porapak QS column and the composition of the reaction mixture before or after the reaction was determined automatically, by injection of the outflowing gas directly into the chromatographic column. The catalytic test were carried out at the partial pressure of 2-propnol of 8.5 kPa and within the temperature range from 50 to 140 °C, dependent on the type of catalysts."
3,H6P2Mo18O62 preparation and characterization,"2.2 H6P2Mo18O62 preparation and characterization In preparation of H6P2Mo18O62 we follow a procedure originally given in [24] with certain modifications that have been found necessary. A water solution of Na2MoO4 has been mixed with H3PO4 and concentrated HCl. The mixture was kept boiling under reflux for eight hours. After cooling it down to r.t. NH4Cl was added to the solution. The precipitate was separated using Buchner funnel, extracted in water (1:1 by weight) and the supernatant solution was filtered out. The collected filtrate was used to prepare a 20% (by weight) solution of NH4Cl which was left for crystallization at r.t. The crystals were subsequently recrystallized at 40 °C and stored in refrigerator. After the recrystallization, the crystals were dozed with pure diethyl ether and dried on filtering paper. The obtained ammonium salt was dosed with concentrated HCl and extracted with diethyl ether until a point of the formation of three distinct phases of which the lowest one consisted of the required solution of the Wells-Dawson-type H6P2Mo18O62 (P2Mo) heteropolyacid. This lowest phase was then evaporated. The yield of synthesis was 75%. The XRD pattern of the obtained Wells-Dawson-type P2Mo is shown in Fig. 1A, indicating relatively good crystallinity. Apart from the main product, the Wells-Dawson-type H6P2Mo18O62, also an impurity of the Keggin-type H3PMo12O40 acid might possibly be formed in this synthesis. Nevertheless, the main reflections in the XRD pattern of the obtained product, that is, at 2θ = 6.7˚; 7.7˚; 8.4˚; 8.8˚; 9.3˚; 17.5˚; 24.4˚; 25.6˚, was confirmed not to belong to the Keggin-type H3PMo12O40, basing on literature data [25]. Fig. 1B shows the 31P NMR for the obtained Wells-Dawson-type H6P2Mo18O62 compared to the Keggin-type H3PMo12O40 reported in [26]. For the Keggin-type polyoxoanion, the 31P signal appears at 4.1 ppm, whereas for the Dawson-type structure, a well resolved signal is evident at 2.7 ppm. It can be concluded that our preparation leads to purely Dawson-type heteropolyacid. Fig. 1C shows the TG and DSC curves of the hydrated H6P2Mo18O62 sample. The total weight loss corresponded to 18.7 H2O per mole of heteropolyacid. Assuming that the last portion of water removed above 220 °C (3 mol H2O per mole HPA) corresponded to the “water of constitution’’ bonded in the form of OH groups, the formula of the initial sample was H6P2Mo18O62⋅18.7 H2O. The analysis also confirmed the high thermal stability of P2Mo up to 514 °C. The composition of P2Mo sample was confirmed by EDS analysis. This analysis (atomic percent of phosphorus and molybdenum) has been performed at 11 points of HPA (Fig. 2 ). The results are listed in Table 2 . The Mo/P ratio is close to the expected stoichiometric value of 9 in P2Mo. Fig. 3 A and B present the structural vibrations of the P2Mo anion, respectively, within the range of 1200 – 650 cm−1 and the vibrations of OH bond at 3600 – 1500 cm−1 respectively. Specified structural vibrations are listed in Table 3 whereas the positions of oxygen atoms: Oa to Oe in the anion are presented in Fig. 3C. The bending vibration of loosely bonded H2O is well resolved at 1620 cm−1 both in the as made P2Mo sample as well as in a sample after the evacuation at r.t. (Fig. 3A). The band at 3490 cm−1 corresponds to the OH vibration in loosely bonded water molecules, both in pristine the P2Mo, as well as after its evacuation at r.t. (Fig. 3B spectra a and b). The band at 1710 cm−1 may be ascribed either to oxonium ions (H3O+) or to dioxonium ions (H5O2 +) [27] in hydrated sample (Fig. 3B spectra a and b). At elevated temperature (100 °C), the absence of adsorbed crystallization water (Fig. 3B, spectrum c) is evidenced by disappearance of the 1620 cm−1 and 1710 cm−1 bands. Therefore, the broad band at 3260 cm−1 (Fig. 3B, spectrum c) may be assigned to OHO hydrogen bonds between the neighboring Wells-Dawson anions."
4,Novel method for acidity measurement,"2.3 Novel method for acidity measurement An innovative way of evaluating the acidity of HPA consisted of applying the IR spectroscopy, instead of gas chromatography, to follow the reactions commonly used for acidity testing in solid catalysts, namely: the dehydrations of methanol (MeOH) and 2-propanol (PrOH). A single calibration band has been selected in each IR spectrum in a way to avoid overlapping of the selected bands in the reagent spectra, MeOH or PrOH, with those in the product spectra. The analyzed products included dimethyl ether (DME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE) and propylene (C3). Fig. 4 brings together the spectra of gaseous MeOH and DME (reagent and product) with the selected calibration bands marked, respectively at 1033 cm−1, and 1178 cm−1. Fig. 5 , in turn, represents the gas phase IR spectra for PrOH, DIPE and C3 in which the bands at 1250, 1021 and 3091 cm−1, respectively, have been selected for calibration. The calibration curves has been shown in Figs. S1–S5 in Supplementary Material. They were prepared individually for each component, using the area under the selected IR band in its spectra recorded against its gradually increased partial pressure in reactor. The curves were fitted with straight lines, with the correlation factor R 2 ranging from 0.980 to 0.994. The dehydration activity tests were carried out using a batch microreactor located within IR spectrometer. Inside the microreactor, a sample containing 0.06 g of HPA, with respect to anhydrous material, was kept in a quartz boat. Each sample was tested at several discrete temperature points, ranging from r.t. to 140 °C. Prior to the experiment, the loaded reactor was pumped out for 10 min in order to remove the adsorbed water (Table 4 ). The sample was then exposed to a reagent, either methanol (0.7 kPa), or 2-propanol (1.5 kPa). The initial IR spectra of the gas phase were collected twice, after 10 and 20 min at r.t. Afterwards, the gas phase was pumped out and the reactor was heated to 40 °C. After reaching the required temperature, the pumping was still continued for 5 min, followed by a subsequent exposure to either alcohol at the pressure the same as that used previously at r.t. The IR spectra were then collected after 10 and 20 min at 40 °C. Each subsequent passage to a next temperature point involved the same procedure of evacuation and heating, with pumping for 5 min at new temperature, followed by exposure to a new portion of reagent, and the IR spectra collected twice at 10 min intervals. At each point, the gas phase composition was determined using the calibration curves for the individual components."
5,Results and discussion,"Recording the IR spectra of the gas phase over the catalyst bed in situ during the test reactions made it possible to detect changes in the gas composition resulting from the reaction progress. The dehydration of methanol on HPAs led to a gradually increased content of dimethyl ether in the gas phase. The conversion of 2-propanol, in turn, led to the formations of propylene and diisopropyl ether on those catalysts at the same temperature range."
6,In-situ methanol dehydration monitoring by IR spectrometer,"3.1 In-situ methanol dehydration monitoring by IR spectrometer Fig. 6 shows a temperature–dependent evolution of the gas phase IR spectra in the MeOH dehydration on the PW catalyst. The decreasing intensity of the 1033 cm−1 band, indicative of decreasing content of MeOH in the gas phase, demonstrates the increasing conversion of MeOH as function of temperature. At the same time the increasing content of the DME products is signaled by increasing intensity of the band at 1178 cm−1. To establish the MeOH conversion for each temperature point T, the surface area ST MeOH of the characteristic band for MeOH (1033 cm−1) in each spectrum, was used to calculate its ratio to the analogous area S°MeOH in the spectrum obtained prior to the reaction at the temperature T 0. The degree of MeOH conversion (ConvMeOH ) and yield of DME (YDME ) were then calculated using formulas (1) and (2) derived from the Clapeyron equation and the definition of conversion and yield: (1) C o n v M e O H = 1 - S M e O H T S M e O H o ∙ T o T ∙ 100 % (2) Y D M E = 2 ∙ a D M E ∙ S D M E T a M e O H ∙ S M e O H o ∙ T o T ∙ 100 % where: T o T o - the highest temperature at which no reaction occurs S M e O H o - surface area of the characteristic band for MeOH (at 1033 cm−1) at To (before starting the reaction) S M e O H T - surface area of the characteristic band for MeOH (at 1033 cm−1) at T aMeOH , aDME – calibration factors for MeOH and DME Fig. 7 represents the methanol conversion and yield of DME on HPAs tested as a function of temperature. The methanol dehydration over heteropolyacids starts above 80 °C (Fig. 7). Alcohol conversion over HPAs grows up to 82% (Fig. 7A). However, for PW and P2W, their rate of the activity increase with temperature is much more pronounced, compared to PMo and P2Mo. It can be noted, that on reaching the temperature of 120 °C, the HPA containing tungsten (PW, P2W) became definitely superior to those containing molybdenum (PMo, P2Mo). Below 120 °C, on the other hand, the activity of all the catalysts is low. This seems to suggest, that chemical composition may be more decisive for the activity of HPA than a type of heteropolyacid structure (Keggin or Wells-Dawson type). DME is the only detectable product. It is clear, however, that in most cases, there is a gap between the yield and conversion, i.e., the DME yield does not account for the whole MeOH conversion. This may be a result of the fact that only a fraction of an entire amount of MeOH molecules absorbed on HPA actually undergoes the dehydration. However, the part of MeOH that remains unreacted and still sorbed on the solid bulk of HPA crystallites HPA goes undetected in the gas-phase IR measurement. From the point of view of using the IR-derived MeOH conversion degree as a measure of catalysts acidity, the existence of the unreacted pool must be considered a nuisance, since in spite of being removed from the gas phase it does not necessarily involve any acidic functionality of catalyst. Hence the IR-derived conversion degree of MeOH carries a risk of overestimation when applied as a measure of catalysts acidity. Nevertheless, in spite of the potential overestimation, the MeOH conversion may still be useful in a comparative study of a group of catalysts, provided that an extent of the overestimation will be similar for all the materials within the studied group. This seems to be the case for HPAs."
7,Ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry,"3.2 Ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry The gas flow-through microcalorimetry has been used to measure the heats of ammonia sorption at 150 °C, concurrently with the uptake of ammonia. Results are presented in Table 5 . The strength of acid sites is proportional to the molar heat of NH3 sorption (-ΔH) whereas amount of irreversible sorbed ammonia corresponds the sorption capacities of catalysts. Hence the acidity order measured by microcalorimetry may be represented as follows: (3) PW > P2W > P2Mo > PMo The diagnostic power of the MeOH dehydration as an acidity test results from its mechanism relying on HPA’s protons to form a methoxonium intermediate (CH3OH)H+ before producing DME [28,29]. Hence the values ConvMeOH can be related to the acid strength of catalysts represented by the heat of ammonia sorption. Fig. 8 shows the linear correlations of the MeOH conversion degree and the yield of DME, both obtained from IR at 120 °C, plotted as function of the heat of NH3 sorption measured calorimetrically, -ΔH. The figure shows a gap between the conversion and the DME yield for all four HPAs (cf. discussion of Fig. 7 above). However, both parameters appear to be an approximately linear function of the heats of NH3 sorption, although with somehow larger scatter in the case of the DME yield. Line Yexpected (solid, green line in Fig. 8) represents a linear fit to half values of the experimental methanol conversion (Yexpected=ConvMeOH/2). Comparison of the DME line to half values of the conversion should help in a relative error estimation. It shows, that the relative error in acidity assessment due to the undetected, sorbed MeOH, decreases with acidity, being much larger for PMo, compared to PW (cf. Fig. 8). On the other hand, it may also be suggested, that the DME yield itself can be a measure of acidity. It correlates with the heat of ammonia sorption well, but seems to underestimate the actual acidity. We suggest, that both the IR-derived reaction parameters, the MeOH conversion degree and the DME yield, may be used as an acidity measure simultaneously, to confirm that both reveal the same acidity trend."
8,In-situ 2-propanol dehydration monitoring by IR spectrometer,"3.3 In-situ 2-propanol dehydration monitoring by IR spectrometer In similar way, the validity of using the conversion of 2-propanol for testing the acidity of catalysts has been examined for the same group of heteropolyacids. The reaction was carried out in situ using the same batch microreactor that was used for the methanol conversion placed within the IR spectrometer. The results are shown in Fig. 9 . The area under the band at 1250 cm−1, related to the PrOH content, decreases strongly with rising temperature, in contrast to the increase of the 3090 cm−1 band representing the C3 content. The content of DIPE, in turn, (1021 cm−1 band) initially rises with temperature, followed by a slight decrease on further temperature rise (to ca. 130 °C), apparently due to a consecutive formation of C3 from DIPE. The degree of PrOH conversion, ConvPrOH , has been calculated using the area under the characteristic PrOH band at 1250 cm−1. Formula (4) applied for the calculations is an analogous to formula (1) previously used for MeOH. The yields of products YC3 and YDIPE have been calculated using the areas of the characteristic bands for C3 (3090 cm−1) and DIPE (1021 cm−1) and the appropriate calibration factors (equations 5 and 6). The following formulas were used: (4) C o n v P r O H = 1 - S P r O H T S P r O H o ∙ T o T ∙ 100 % (5) Y C 3 = a C 3 ∙ S C 3 T a P r O H ∙ S P r O H o ∙ T o T ∙ 100 % (6) Y D I P E = a D I P E ∙ S D I P E T a P r O H ∙ S P r O H o ∙ T o T ∙ 100 % Y C 3 = a C 3 ∙ S C 3 T a P r O H ∙ S P r O H o ∙ T o T ∙ 100 % where: To – the highest temperature at which no reaction occurs S P r O H o - surface area of the characteristic band for PrOH at To S P r O H T , S C 3 T , S D I P E T areas of the characteristic bands at temperature T, respectively for PrOH, C3 and DIPE aDIPE , aC3 – calibration factors for DIPE and C3 Fig. 10 shows the IR-determined results of the PrOH dehydration tests on HPAs obtained using IR spectrometer in-situ at 120 °C. The highest conversion, as well as the highest yield of propylene, were observed for PW (91.1% and 17.8% respectively). Fig. 11 shows a correlation between the IR-determined results of the PrOH dehydration tests on HPAs and the microcalorimetrically measured heats of sorption of ammonia on the same catalysts. Both the degree of PrOH conversion and the yield of C3 show a good correlation with the heats of NH3 sorption in the HPAs, considered to be a measure of the catalysts acidity. Again, this correlation confirms the adequacy of the IR spectroscopy for determining the conversion degree in situ in the PrOH dehydration tests. Fig. 12 shows the IR-determined yield of the DIPE formation in PrOH dehydration on HPAs, as a function of temperature. Except for the PMo, the other catalysts show clear maxima, as the DIPE is increasingly consumed in the consecutive C3 formation. Effectively, the yield of DIPE reaches 60% on P2W at 70 °C and 42% on PW at 90 °C. In the case of P2Mo and PMo yield of DIPE is low (less than 10%) at low reaction temperature. The following order of maximum of yield of DIPE can be write: P2W > PW > P2Mo > PMo. This order does not correlate with acidity order determined by microcalorimetry (3) because P2W is most active catalyst in DIPE formation. It is also clearly seen that heteropolyacids containing tungsten are more efficient in DIPE production than HPAs containing molybdenum. Apart from the acid strength, therefore, yet another factor has its bearing on the catalytic performance of heteropolyacids in the conversion of 2-propanol. We know that the H+ species are involved in the formation of both the C3 and DIPE products. As it was confirmed for ethanol dehydration [30,31], the olefin (ethylene) is most likely formed on the surface of HPAs crystallites, whereas ether (DEE) is formed within their bulk. A similar arrangement may be expected in 2-propanol dehydration. The 2-propanol sorption capacity of the catalysts may be therefore crucial for it performance. As it turns out, the sorption capacity of HP2W is much superior to that of HPW [32]. Accordingly, the PrOH/H+ ratio at 40 °C on HP2W was measured to be 0.12, but on HPW it was only 0.04. This seems to be related to the higher activity of HP2W in the formation of DIPE."
9,In-situ 2-propanol dehydration monitoring by gas chromatography,"3.4 In-situ 2-propanol dehydration monitoring by gas chromatography The experiments described so far have been carried out using the IR cell connected with a dosing system making it possible to admit the alcohol reagents (MeOH, or PrOH). Effectively, the IR cell played a role of a batch microreactor. For comparison, a flow-through microreactor has been used to carry out the 2-propanol conversion with the gas chromatograph (GC) applied for the up-stream and down-stream analysis. Fig. 13 shows that both the conversion of 2-propanol and the yield of C3, determined by GC in the flow-through mode, turns out to be higher than those measured for this reaction using batch microreactor with IR analysis. The apparently better performance may be explained by an effect of water, which being formed in the process, can be instantly removed from the reactor working in the flow-through mode, while in the batch microreactor it remains on the catalyst and can block the H+ species. In either mode, however, the acidity trends of HPAs based on the PrOH conversion turned out to be the same. Comparing Figs. 11 and 14 makes it also possible to conclude that in both cases the acidity is approximately a linear function of the degree of PrOH conversion as well as of the yield of C3. The catalytic results of alcohols (methanol and 2-propanol) dehydration in gas phase were compare with the literature data [33,13] in Supplementary Material."
10,Conclusions,"Acidity of catalysts can be evaluated according to their performance in certain test reactions, such as dehydrations of methanol or 2-propanol, that can be carried out and analyzed in situ within an IR chamber. The monitoring of the catalytic performance in alcohol dehydration by FTIR spectrometer consists of evaluation of usual catalytic parameters such as the degree of conversion of alcohol and the yield of olefin. Both these parameters turned out to correlate well with the acidity of catalysts estimated by the heats of NH3 sorption, measured separately with the gas flow-through microcalorimetry. The following acidity trend of HPAs has been established: H3PW12O40> H6P2W18O62> H6P2Mo18O62>H3PMo12O40 Ranked according to heat of ammonia sorption, the phosphotungstic acids are more acidic than the phosphomolybdic ones. Among the latter, however, the Wells-Dawson type H6P2Mo18O62 (ΔH = 138 kJ/mol NH3) is more acidic than the Keggin H3PMo12O40 (ΔH = 115 kJ/mol NH3), whereas an opposite tendency appears among the phosphotungstic acids, with the Keggin structure H3PW12O40 significantly more acidic (ΔH = 235 kJ/mol NH3) than the Wells-Dawson H6P2W18O62 (ΔH = 159 kJ/mol NH3). It can be suggested that the composition of HPAs is more decisive for their potential acidity than the structure of polyoxoanion."
