0,Introduction,"Secondary amines are one of the important chemicals or intermediates for fine chemical syntheses. They are generally produced by stoichiometric reactions using alkyl halides with primary amines or the reductive amination of aldehydes or ketones with primary amines via the formation of imine [1]. However, the former process has drawbacks that a lot of inorganic salts and undesired different amines are produced as by-products. As to the reductive amination, alcohols are more beneficial than carbonyl compounds because carbonyl compounds are generally produced by the oxidation of alcohols. The N-alkylation of primary amines with alcohols to produce secondary amines has been recently focused as a new efficient method for the production of secondary amines [2]. It consists three steps in one-pot; (i) the dehydrogenation of alcohol to aldehyde, (ii) the dehydrated condensation of aldehyde with primary amine to form imine via hemiaminal intermediate, and (iii) the hydrogen transfer to produce secondary amine (Scheme 1 ). The hydrogen, generated by the step (i), can be used for the step (iii), so that neither O2 nor H2 is required for the alcohol oxidation or hydrogenation of imine. In addition, water is the only by-product. The N-alkylation has been mainly studied in the presence of homogeneous metal catalysts [3–7]. More recently, heterogeneous metal catalysts, such as Ru [8], Ag [9,10], Pd [11], and Cu [12] have been reported to be active for the N-alkylation. However, high catalytic activity or selectivity to secondary amine has generally been obtained by using excess amount of alcohols or amines or in the presence of acidic or basic additives. Gold catalysts, that had long been considered to be catalytically inert, have gained prominence since Au exhibits unique size- and support-dependent catalytic activity and selectivity [13]. We reported that Au clusters supported on inert porous coordination polymers could catalyze the N-alkylation of amine with alcohol under equimolar amounts of substrates [14]. Although the size effect of Au particles was pronounced especially for Au particles deposited on inert supports, base was required to promote the first dehydrogenation step, even when Au could be deposited as clusters smaller than 2nm. Later, Cao and co-workers reported that Au clusters deposited on TiO2 exhibited the highest catalytic activity and selectivity to secondary amine among the metal oxide-supported Au catalysts under the equimolar amount of substrates without additives [15]. However, the reaction was performed under pressurized N2. On the other hand, Peng et al. synthesized N-benzylaniline from nitrobenzene with benzyl alcohol over Au/Fe2O3 in the presence of large excess amount of alcohol [16]. These suggested that the catalytic performance of Au could be significantly changed by the kind of supports, however, the role of supports is not fully investigated. In this work, we have screened a variety of metal oxide-supported Au catalysts in the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol under the most atom-economical reaction conditions; using equimolar amounts of substrates without additives under atmospheric pressure of N2 and investigated the origin of support effects. We also examined the N-alkylation with aliphatic alcohol."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials High purity microparticulate CeO2 and ZrO2 (RC-100) were supplied by Dai-ichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. Alumina, (Al2O3, NEOBEAD 300), and TiO2 (P-25) were supplied by Mizusawa Industrial Chemicals, Ltd. and Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd., respectively. Proprietary WO3 was used as a support. Reagent grade, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and Fe(NO3)2·6H2O were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. and used as received. Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) was prepared by the neutralization method from aqueous Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution with aqueous Na2CO3 solution followed by calcination in air at 300°C for 4h. Tetrachloroauric acid tetrahydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O) was purchased from Kishida chemical. Dimethyl gold(III)acetylacetonate, Me2Au(acac), was purchased from Trichemical Laboratories Inc and used as received. Reagent grade, aniline, benzyl alcohol, N-benzylidenbenzylamine, dodecane, and toluene were purchased and used without further purification."
3,Instruments,"2.2 Instruments Ball milling was carried out by using Nagao System Planet M2-3 with ZrO2 pot and ZrO2 balls (ϕ =2 and 5mm). Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) observations were carried out by using a JEOL JEM-3000F operating at 300kV. Diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were obtained by using a JASCO FT/IR-620. Diffuse reflectance accessory (Spectra Tech, Collector) can be evacuated and heated. Catalyst samples were pretreated at 200°C for 0.5h under vacuum (<10−3 Pa). After the catalyst was cooled to room temperature, DRIFT spectra were obtained before the introduction of compounds. Then, benzyl alcohol, aniline, and benzaldehyde were adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces at room temperature under vacuum for 30min and DRIFT spectra were obtained after the adsorption under vacuum. The conversions and product yields of N-alkylation were measured by gas chromatography (GC) by using a SHIMADZU GC-14B with a G-Column G-205 (1.2mm i.d., 40m, Chemicals Evaluation and Research Institute Japan) using dodecane as an internal standard. Qualitative analysis was performed with a GC-MS (SHIMADZU PARVUM2 and GC-2010 with a Shinwa Chemical ULBON HR-1 capillary column, 0.25mm i.d., 30m)."
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation Gold on ZrO2 was prepared by the grinding method [17]. A mixture of metal oxide support (3.0g), Me2Au(acac) (50mg for 1wt% Au loading), and acetone (10g) was ground by ball milling (350rpm) in air at room temperature for 30min. The mixture was filtered, and calcined in air at 300°C for 4h. Gold on WO3 was prepared by mixing WO3 powder with Me2Au(acac) in an agate mortar at room temperature for 20min followed by calcination in air at 300°C for 4h [18]. Gold on NiO and Fe2O3 were prepared by the co-precipitation [19]. Gold on CeO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and Co3O4 were prepared by the deposition-precipitation (DP) method according to the literature [20]. Gold on MgO was prepared by DP in the presence of Mg citrate according to the literature [21]."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests A mixture of benzyl alcohol (52μL, 0.5mmol), aniline (46μL, 0.5mmol), Au catalyst (Au 1.5mol% to substrate), and toluene (3.0mL) was stirred under N2 atmosphere at 110°C for 22h. After the reaction, the mixture was extracted with Et2O and filtered. The filtrate was analyzed by GC using dodecane as an internal standard. In principle, there are two selectivities based on the conversions of benzyl alcohol and of aniline. To simplify the comparison of the support effects, the selectivity to secondary amine was calculated based on the total yields by the following equation: selectivity=yield of sec. amine/total yield of products (sec. amine, imine, aldehyde, and benzyl benzoate)."
6,Results,
7,Support screening,"3.1 Support screening Acid–base properties of metal oxides can be correlated to the electronegativity of metal element or metal ions (χ i) in metal oxide support and an increase in electronegativity increased acidity of metal oxide surfaces [23]. χ i is expressed as χ i =(1+2z)χ 0, where χ 0 is the Pauling's electronegativity of metal element and z is the valence of metal ions [23]. Table 1 shows the results of the N-alkylation of aniline (1) with benzyl alcohol (2) over Au NPs supported on metal oxides. Gold on basic (entries 1–3) and neutral metal oxides (entries 4–8) showed relatively higher alcohol conversions than Au on acidic WO3 (entry 9) except for Au/NiO (entry 2) and Au/Fe2O3 (entry 7). Among the catalysts, Au/ZrO2 gave both appreciable high catalytic activity and the highest selectivity to secondary amine (5) (entry 6). While Au/NiO (entry 2) and Au/WO3 (entry 9) gave relatively low alcohol conversions, they exhibited better selectivity to sec. amine than others. We have reported that Au/NiO was highly active for aerobic oxidation of methanol in the presence of amine and preferentially oxidized alcohol to give formamide [22], whereas it showed relatively lower catalytic activity but better selectivity to sec. amine than others in N-alkylation. This result implies that the catalytic nature of Au/NiO for alcohol transformation was altered by the presence of O2. Gold on CeO2 gave not only sec. amine but also benzaldehyde (3) and benzyl benzoate (6) as by-products, lowering the selectivity to sec. amine (entry 3). Benzyl benzoate was formed from benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol via the formation of hemiacetal followed by the dehydrogenation (Scheme 2 ). Gold on Co3O4 and Au/Fe2O3 gave only imine (4) and did not promote the hydrogen transfer even when the amount of Au was increased (entries 5 and 7). Cao and co-workers reported that Au/TiO2 exhibited high catalytic activity and selectivity in the N-alkylation [15]. However, Au/TiO2 did not show high selectivity to sec. amine under our conditions (entry 8) probably due to the relatively larger Au NPs (2.8nm) in our catalysts than 1.8nm in Au/TiO2 prepared by Cao and co-workers. In the N-alkylation, Shimizu et al. demonstrated that the yield of secondary amine could be correlated to the electronegativity of metal element in metal oxides, showing that volcano type relationships with Al2O3 support at the top for Ag clusters catalysts [9]. Fig. 1a and b show the relationships between the electronegativity of metal ions (χ i) and the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity to sec. amine, respectively. It has been reported in the reaction mechanism of Au NPs-catalyzed alcohol oxidation that the deprotonation of alcohols to form alkoxide takes place at the basic sites of metal oxide surfaces [24]. Therefore, basic oxides have been recognized as efficient supports. It is reasonable that basic and neutral oxides gave higher alcohol conversion than acidic WO3 (Fig. 1a). On the contrary, the relationships between acid–base properties and the selectivity to sec. amine were not observed under our conditions (Fig. 1b)."
8,Dehydrogenation of alcohol over gold catalysts,"3.2 Dehydrogenation of alcohol over gold catalysts Catalytic performance of Au catalysts for the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol was studied (Table 2 ). The reaction proceeded in the absence of aniline and the formation of molecular hydrogen was confirmed. The catalytic activity order was similar to the one for the N-alkylation. However, the conversion of benzyl alcohol decreased to 46% (entry 3) as compared to 82% in the N-alkylation over Au/ZrO2. It is likely that imine acted as a hydrogen acceptor to remove hydrogen or hydride from the Au surfaces in a similar manner to O2 in the catalytic cycle of oxidative dehydrogenation over Au catalysts [24]. Again, Au/NiO showed poor catalytic activity in the absence of O2 (entry 1). The catalytic activity of Au/CeO2 for the dehydrogenation was not affected by the absence of aniline (entry 2). Fang et al. demonstrated that Au NPs supported on hydrotalcite possessing both acidity and basicity exhibited the best catalytic performance among the other supports such as acidic or basic metal oxides for the dehydrogenation of alcohol in the absence of hydrogen acceptor [25]. They proposed that H+ would be supplied from acidic sites of hydrotalcite. However, taking into account that Au NPs supported on basic CeO2 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of alcohol, CeO2 possesses an ability to supply H+ although there are no acidic sites on CeO2. These results implied that hydrogen transfer efficiency from imine to sec. amine did not directly correlate to the surface acidity of metal oxide supports."
9,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.3 Optimization of reaction conditions We further searched better reaction conditions by using Au/ZrO2 (Table 3 ). To use excess amount of alcohol or amine has usually been adopted in order to achieve higher selectivity to sec. amines [8–12]. The fact, that the conversion of benzyl alcohol exceeded the conversion of aniline, suggested that side reactions of alcohol might occur such as disproportionation to benzaldehyde and toluene [25] and toluene formation by the hydrogenolysis with H2 generated by the dehydrogenation of alcohol [11]. Accordingly, 2-propanol was added as a hydrogen donor but not effective to improve the selectivity to sec. amine (entry 2). It was probably due to the reaction inhibition of benzaldehyde with aniline on Au surfaces. When an excess amount of aniline (2eq.) was used, the hydrogen transfer efficiency was improved to give 78% selectivity to sec. amine whereas the dehydrogenation of alcohol was inhibited (entry 3). An increase in the gold content appreciably improved the selectivity to sec. amine and 4mol% of Au achieved the selectivity of 94% under equimolar amount of alcohol and aniline without additives (entry 4)."
10,N-Alkylation of aliphatic substrate,"3.4 N-Alkylation of aliphatic substrate We examined N-alkylation by using aliphatic amine and alcohol. The combination of butyl amine with 1-hexanol did not give the corresponding sec. amine but butylidene butyl amine via the dehydrogenative homo-coupling of butyl amine. When reactive benzyl alcohol was used, the coupling of butyl amine was prevented and the corresponding sec. amine was obtained in 26% yield. In addition, 1-hexanol could be converted and reacted with aniline to give sec. amine in 15% yield. Although the selectivity to sec. amine was not satisfied at this stage, this result proved that Au/ZrO2 could promote the dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohol and followed the N-alkylation."
11,Adsorption behavior of metal oxide supported gold catalysts,"3.5 Adsorption behavior of metal oxide supported gold catalysts In order to investigate the support effects on the secondary amine selectivity, we studied the adsorption behavior of benzyl alcohol, aniline, and benzaldehyde onto the catalysts by DRIFT spectra (Figs. 2–4 ). Benzyl alcohol was adsorbed on Au/CeO2 and Au/ZrO2, but not on Au/WO3 judging from the adsorption peaks at 3060, 3024, 2954, and 2910cm−1 which were ascribed to the C–H stretching (Fig. 2). These results were in a good agreement with the surface acidity of metal oxides and the catalytic activity order for alcohol conversion. On the aniline adsorption experiments, new adsorption peaks were not observed for Au/CeO2 but for Au/ZrO2 and Au/WO3 (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3b and c, the peaks at 3076 and 3020cm−1 were assigned as C–H stretching. The peaks at 1605 and 1496cm−1 were assigned as CC ring stretching [26–28].Vijayaraj et al. reported that N–H stretching peaks of adsorbed aniline were higher wavenumber shift (3228 and 3320cm−1 from pure aniline at 3290 and 3355cm−1, respectively) [28]. They also mentioned that the peak between 3500 and 3800cm−1 was observed due to the interaction of polarized NH2 with surface oxygen, leading to the formation of surface OH groups [28]. The other report mentioned that a broad O–H stretching band between 3600 and 3700cm−1 indicated the OH/π interaction [26]. In Fig. 3, broad N–H stretching peaks at 3220–3330 and 3590–3630cm−1 were observed for Au/ZrO2 and ZrO2, suggesting the adsorption of aniline on their surfaces. Tanaka and Ogasawara reported that the peak was observed at 2570cm−1 (NH3 + deformation) when aniline was adsorbed on acidic sites [26]. They also proposed that the lower wavenumber shift of N–H deformation band from 1630cm−1 (pure aniline) to 1575cm−1 was due to aniline adsorbed on Lewis acid sites or by hydrogen bonds [26]. In contrast, we did not observed peaks at around 2570cm−1 for all the catalysts. Instead, the N–H deformation band was considered to be overlapped at 1605cm−1, suggesting that aniline was not adsorbed on strong acid sites but weakly adsorbed on Au/ZrO2 and on ZrO2 (Fig. 3b and c). These results imply that the presence of strong acid sites is not necessary since aniline can be weakly adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites or by hydrogen bonds. In addition, the adsorption peaks of aniline were also observed for ZrO2 without Au (Fig. 3c), indicating that adsorption ability was come from metal oxide properties. Aniline was adsorbed also on Au/WO3 judging from an adsorption peak at 1492cm−1 (CC ring stretching) although the peaks were very weak (Fig. 3d). Gold on CeO2 and Au/ZrO2 adsorbed benzaldehyde on their surfaces (Fig. 4). Due to the lack of aniline adsorption ability for Au/CeO2, benzaldehyde reacted with benzyl alcohol to form hemiacetal followed by the dehydrogenation to produce benzyl benzoate as a by-product (Scheme 2). Among these catalysts, only Au/ZrO2, which could adsorb benzyl alcohol, aniline, benzaldehyde on the surfaces, showed the highest catalytic activity and the selectivity, indicating that the adsorption of benzaldehyde on Au/ZrO2 enabled the rapid condensation of aniline with aldehyde into imine or hemiaminal intermediate on the Au surfaces."
12,Discussion,
13,Support effects on the N-alkylation,"4.1 Support effects on the N-alkylation To elucidate the reaction pathway for the N-alkylation, hydrogen transfer reaction from benzyl alcohol to imine over Au/ZrO2 was examined. The yield of sec. amine decreased to 17% as compared to 46% for the N-alkylation (Table 1, entry 6), meaning that imine was only slightly adsorbed on Au/ZrO2 surfaces. This was in opposite to the case of polymer supported Au clusters [14]. In the case of metal oxide supported Au catalysts, imine could not be easily converted to sec. amine once imine was formed in the reaction solution without catalysts or diffused into the solution from the catalyst surfaces. As Cao and co-workers [15] and Shimizu et al. [9] have mentioned for the N-alkylation over Au/TiO2 and Ag/Al2O3, respectively, it is likely that the hydrogen transfer would occur via hemiaminal intermediates rather than imine on Au/ZrO2 surface. Therefore, the aniline adsorption ability of metal oxides at the Lewis acidic sites or by OH/π-interactions would play an important role."
14,Reaction pathways for N-alkylation,"4.2 Reaction pathways for N-alkylation A plausible reaction pathway is shown in Scheme 3 . Deprotonation of alcohol was promoted at the basic sites of ZrO2 to from alkoxide on the Au surfaces. Gold catalyzes the β-hydride elimination to produce benzaldehyde. Aldehyde and aniline, which are adsorbed on the ZrO2 surfaces beforehand, react to form hemiaminal. Before hemiaminal is converted to imine, hydride on the Au NPs and proton on the surface OH groups on ZrO2 move to produce sec. amine. Acidic OH groups might contribute as proton sources and as aniline adsorption sites. However, taking into account that Au NPs supported on basic CeO2 could also catalyze the dehydrogenation of alcohol, protons could be supplied not only from acidic sites but also other surface OH groups. Although the acidic sites of ZrO2 would be involved in the catalytic reaction, acidity of metal oxides was not a major factor to determine the hydrogen transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of 2-propanol as a hydrogen donor lowered the selectivity to sec. amine over Au/ZrO2 (Table 3, entry 2). It is indicated that excess amount of alcohols inhibited the adsorption of aniline onto ZrO2 surfaces, resulting the imine formation in the reaction solution. Therefore, it can be concluded that aniline adsorption ability of oxide supports plays an important role to achieve high hydrogen transfer efficiency."
15,Conclusions,"We have demonstrated that Au/ZrO2 works as an efficient catalyst for the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol to yield secondary amine using equimolar amount of substrates without additives under N2 at an atmospheric pressure. Although Au/CeO2 showed the highest catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of alcohol in the absence of aniline, the hydrogen transfer efficiency was lower than that of Au/ZrO2 due to the lack of aniline adsorption ability. It was revealed that not only basic and acidic properties of metal oxide surfaces but also aniline adsorption ability by hydrogen bonding were important in the N-alkylation and that aniline adsorption might influence on the hydrogen transfer efficiency to give secondary amine in high yields."
