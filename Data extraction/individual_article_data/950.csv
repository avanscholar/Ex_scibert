0,Introduction,"Some binary mixtures with non-ideal vapor-liquid behavior produce azeotropes in thermochemical processes. Typical boiling azeotropes can form between two chemical components. A minimum boiling azeotrope can form when activity coefficients are greater than unity wherein components are dissimilar and repulsion forces are relatively strong. When activity coefficients are less than unity and components attract each other, a maximum boiling azeotrope can form (Luyben, 2013). These types of mixtures can be separated by special distillation methods, such as extractive distillation (Rodriguez-Donis et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2014a; Lei et al., 2014b; Shen et al., 2015; Lei et al., 2002), azeotropic distillation (Wasylkiewicz et al., 2000; Luyben, 2006; Munoz et al., 2006; Baharev et al., 2011) and pressure swing distillation (PSD) (Luyben, 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Kiran and Jana, 2015; Farsi et al., 2019a; Farsi et al., 2019b). PSD processes have advantages of a lack of a third solvent introduced, a relatively simple configuration, and possibility of heat recovery for energy savings (Knapp and Doherty, 1992; Suzuta et al., 2001; Repke et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016; Repke et al., 2005). This paper examines a batch reactive column and the operating condition consequences on system performance. The approach uses a sequence of steps and state of events in the model (Albet et al., 1994). The PSD process is a method based on azeotropic composition that changes the system's pressure without introducing other components. This shift in pressure can alter the relative volatilities. This principle is used for separation of maximum and minimum boiling homogeneous azeotropic mixtures into two operating columns including high pressure (HPC) and low-pressure columns (LPC) that operate at two different pressures in the PSD (Huang et al., 2008; Repke et al., 2005). In the minimum boiling mixture separation by the PSD, the bottom streams are recovered as high-purity products. The distillate streams are recycled into the other column and vice versa for the maximum boiling azeotrope (Wang et al., 2016; Repke et al., 2005; Albet et al., 1994; Luyben, 2012). Numerous past studies have been reported about the pressure swing distillation process. Fulgureas et al. (2016) reported the optimization of a water-ethylenediamine maximum boiling azeotropic system through PSD. They noticed that water-ethylenediamine can be used even though the azeotropic composition with low and high pressure is relatively small. After they applied heat integration within the system, the overall heat duty was reduced. Luo et al. (2014) made a comparison of extractive and PSD methods to separate alcohol/diisopropyl ether binary mixtures. They showed that pressure swing distillation can reduce the energy consumption and total annual cost (TAC) versus extractive distillation. Cao et al. (2016) examined the effects of feed temperature on the separation of methyl acetate and a methanol binary azeotrope by controlling PSD. They conducted an optimization of eight processes with eight feed temperature points. The results indicated that selecting a proper feed temperature can minimize the total annual cost. Repke et al. (2005) analyzed the separation of a homogeneous acetonitrile/water system and validated the predictions with experimental data. In their study, the robustness of PSD to disturbances of the feed concentration was reported. They showed that disturbances of the feed flow can be managed even when a relatively simple control structure is implemented and the process can be operated in a large feed concentration range robustly. Modla and Lang (2010) suggested batch distillation of PSD in a double column system for separating acetone-methanol mixtures. They investigated this separation by using a dynamic simulator and converting the energy demand of the separation to the CO2 emissions. They found two columns of the process can be integrated thermally while thermal integration of the two columns can reduce CO2 emissions. Fulgueras et al. (2016) presented a vapor-liquid equilibrium analysis to model and optimize the acetone-methanol mixture by PSD. For the simulation, they created two column configurations by using a process simulator. A thermodynamic model was developed based on a best fit of experimental vapor–liquid equilibrium data. In order to minimize the heat duty, for the high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) columns, the reflux ratios, feed stage locations and optimum theoretical number of stages were set. Wang et al. (2016) controlled and designed two different PSD processes: conventional (CPSD) in which minimum-boiling azeotropes are formed under both low and high operating pressures; and unusual (UPSD) in which minimum and maximum-boiling azeotropes are formed under low and high pressures for n-heptane and isobutanol. This azeotropic behavior exhibits maximum and boiling azeotropes, as the pressure increases. Two processes were compared with their dynamic controllability and economic viability. The authors concluded that the dynamic control of the UPSD is better than the CPSD while the CPSD has superiority of a lower TAC compared to the UPSD. Wei et al. (2013) studied dimethyl carbonate/methanol binary system design at a PSD unit. In this study, researchers performed steady-state and dynamic simulations. They proposed and examined two plant-wide control strategies under the flow rate and feed composition conditions. PSD has an opportunity for heat integration to make the system more energy-efficient. In the past few decades, some studies have been reported to improve the thermal efficiency of the pressure swing distillation process. Huang et al. (2008) examined and proposed heat integration by considering a rectifying/stripping section type for PSD process heat integration in terms of the separation of a binary azeotropic mixture of acetonitrile and water. They compared the conventional PSD with heat-integrated PSD processes. Through the separation of a binary azeotropic mixture of acetonitrile and water, this heat integration can improve the process design in terms of the thermodynamic efficiency and capital investment. Wang et al. (2015) controlled the heat integrated PSD to separate the tetrahydrofuran and methanol azeotropic mixtures. In their past work with PSD, no, partial, and full heat integration were simulated using Aspen Plus Dynamics. Their results demonstrated that in the low-pressure column, a suitable temperature control stage is crucial to control the process efficiently. Li et al. (2016) reported the separation of ethylenediamine/water in a PSD system to analyze economic advantages of heat integration. Their results showed that from an economic viewpoint, partial heat integration is more competitive than a non-heat-integrated process. Luo et al. (2016) examined the process of heat integration in a PSD for separation of an isobutyl alcohol-isobutyl acetate azeotropic mixture. They established and evaluated several control schemes by the feed flow rate and feed composition disturbances to maintain products purities. Qasim et al. (2016) studied optimization of a heat integrated PSD to separate a binary Toluene and 1-Butanol azeotropic mixture. They applied new heat integration methods and compared the conventional PSD process by using a vapor recompression technique combined with PSD. It was concluded that new heat integration methods can help to reduce utilities used in the process. Luyben (2014) explored the application of heat integration to methanol/trimethoxy silane separation processes via PSD to reduce energy costs. One of the promising thermochemical cycles of hydrogen production is the copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) water splitting cycle. Thermochemical cycles have attracted attention as an alternative large-scale hydrogen production method without emitting any contaminants into the environment (Farsi et al., 2019c). In the Cu-Cl cycle, water dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen and the other intermediate chemical species are all recycled on a continuous basis. Several physical and chemical processes occur during this cycle without releasing any pollutants externally (Natarer et al., 2009; Al-Zareer et al., 2017; Zamfirescu et al., 2012). The cycle has unit operations of hydrolysis, thermolysis, electrolysis and drying. The Cu-Cl cycle offers several unique advantages over other thermochemical cycles such as lower operating temperature requirements (below 530 °C) and utilization of low-grade waste heat for endothermic processes (Naterer et al., 2017; Naterer et al., 2015). The Clean Energy Research Laboratory (CERL) team at UOIT developed a four-step Cu-Cl cycle experimentally and theoretically to eventually scale-up this process to industrialization. In the thermochemical cycle, one of the crucial processes is separating and recycling of all chemicals to ensure continuous operation. The pressure swing distillation unit is integrated between the hydrolysis and electrolysis steps to concentrate the weak HCl acid product of the hydrolysis reactor. The PSD unit eliminates water and provides stronger acid to the electrolysis unit to make up anolyte with dissolved CuCl. A hydrochloric acid/water binary mixture forms a maximum boiling azeotrope in which a separation process is not possible through conventional distillation processes. At atmospheric pressure, the azeotropic HCl-water composition is 11.2 mol% HCl and the azeotrope's boiling temperature is 380 K. At a higher pressure (4 atm), the azeotropic composition is 10 mol% HCl and it boils at 419 K (see Fig. 1 ). For the azeotropic composition of the HCl-water binary mixture, the pressure swing distillation method is a promising approach to separate HCl-water via a small shift in composition (Farsi et al., 2019a; Farsi et al., 2019b). Past studies have focused on modeling, simulation and optimization of PSD and heat integrated PSD processes. A few experimental studies concerning PSD have been reported. Repke et al. (2007) operated PSD as a discontinuous (batch) process for acetonitrile/water homogeneous azeotropic separation with regular (feed charged into a bottom tank) and inverted batch process modes (feed charged into the top tank). They formulated a dynamic model for both batch processes and presented new experiments for the inverted batch distillation due to a lack of experimental data. They proposed an alternative inverted batch process. From past literature there remains a lack of data and understanding of HCl/water binary homogeneous azeotropic mixture separation by PSD has still remained. The author's previous studies (Farsi et al., 2019a; Farsi et al., 2019b) reported a comprehensive thermodynamic model and simulations of PSD for separation of HCl/water azeotropic mixtures to recycle concentrated HCl within the Cu-Cl cycle. Moreover, heat transfer modeling has been presented to predict the design objectives of the column. From mass and heat transfer and thermodynamic analyses, the PSD system have been designed and analyzed on both sides of the HCl/water azeotropic point. Furthermore, from mass and heat transfer analyses, the packing height of the column has been determined. In this paper, a new model is developed for the low pressure side of the experimental unit of hydrochloric/water homogeneous azeotropic mixture separation by pressure swing distillation. The PSD apparatus has been operated as a batch process for the low pressure column in CERL at UOIT. The obtained results from the low pressure side evaluation will be used for the next study of PSD as the high pressure column. The thermo-physical properties of the HCl(aq) azeotropic binary solution are obtained from Aspen Plus. The dynamic model of batch distillation has been simulated in EES. Also in this paper, the experimental data will been compared with the model results. The atmospheric distillation process of HCl(aq) is continued until the desired purities of products are achieved."
1,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"Fig. 1 shows temperature profiles at 1 atm and 4 atm for an HCl/water azeotropic system. As seen in Fig. 1(b) at different pressures, a small shift in composition is capable of separating HCl from water by pressure swing distillation. The complete schematic diagram of the PSD process in CERL is shown in Fig. 2 . It consists of three high pressure and two low pressure columns with reboilers, a reflux condenser, buffer vessels, steam condenser, HCl(aq) condenser, safety relief valves, pump, and throttling valves. The size of columns allows a yield of 100 g per day of hydrogen production, but the design of the columns is adjustable to increase this capacity. A packed atmospheric distillation column in CERL is shown in Fig. 3 . The columns are designed to be integrated in a Cu-Cl cycle to deliver over 100 g HCl(aq) per day. For research purposes, the sizes of heat exchangers and vessels were oversized. The column design is flexible and allows one to augment capacity by adjusting parts. The system is supplied with a low concentration HCl(aq) sourced from the hydrolysis reactor. The HCl(aq) at the supply port is in a liquid phase, as a low-concentrated HCl(aq), and it is mixed in the inlet buffer vessel with recycled low pressure HCl(aq) which comes concentrated at around 19% by weight from the bottom of the high pressure side. In the low pressure side (left side of the azeotrope point at 1atm). The buffer vessel with a capacity of 2.5 l is stirred by using a magnetic stirrer to mix streams before feeding two columns. The safety valve above the buffer vessel keeps the atmospheric pressure in the vessel. This is carried out by putting the safety valve atop the reflux condenser. If the pressure becomes more than 1 atm at the column inlet for any possible reason, gas is released in the fume hood. The valve system atop the condenser will permit air to come into the system if the pressure penetrates the vacuum. The low pressure distillation columns are made of 1 inch glass cylinder of 5 ft height. The feed is taken approximately at the middle of the column. The reflux section in two columns is at the top where the vapor pressure is placed. Re-boilers are set-up at the bottom of columns and consist of spherical vessels of 50 ml each, heated by electrical thermal tape. The columns are filled by Rasching rings to increase the interfacial area between the liquid and vapor phase. The non-isolated top part of the column allows for air cooling to form reflux condensers of cca. 20 cm each. An Allihn condenser inclined at 105° is used for the steam condenser and a vertical allhin condenser is used for discharging in a liquid trap. Also, a reflux condenser is implemented for steam condensation. The condensed water is discharged into water storage with a capacity of 25 l The storage is maintained at a constant level via a float valve passing fresh water from the reverse osmosis distillation equipment. Through the selective dissolution and decanting processes, the buffer vessel discharges water to the unit of operation to separate CuCl2 from CuCl. The bottom products of the low pressure columns are collected in a buffer vessel with a capacity of 4 l The concentration of the bottoms will correspond to the azeotrope point at atmospheric pressure which is about 20% by weight. The low pressure column consists of three sections: rectification (enriching) section, stripping section and feed section, as seen in Fig. 4 . At the rectification section, down-flowing liquid is contacting the rising vapor to remove more volatile components in the feed mixture. At the stripping section, by the rising vapor, downward flowing liquid is stripped of the more volatile component. Feed enters the column and is collected at the bottom in the reboiler. The supplied heat at the reboiler generates vapor. Vapor continues up to the stage in the unit to contact the down-flowing liquid. Removing liquid (here concentrated HCl(aq)) from the reboiler is named as a bottom liquid product. The vapor at the top last stage of the column is cooled by a condenser. Some of the liquid is recycled back to the top of the column (reflux). The condensed liquid (water) removed from the column is called overhead product or distillate. The low pressure column of the PSD system has been performed in a batch mode. The low pressure column is charged with a batch maximum boiling HCl/water azeotropic binary mixture. The distillation process is started with a feed molar fraction of 0.101. The glassy column is heated from the exterior at a constant heat flux. The temperature of the column's sections was measured over time and controlled not to exceed 108 °C and not vaporize HCl to the overhead product. From the start-up and end-time of the experimental run of the low pressure column, a sample from the bottom product was taken at certain time intervals. The samples were analyzed using an acid-base titration method with a phenolphthalein indicator to calculate the concentration of the bottom product."
2,Analysis and simulations,"Within the scope of this paper, the start-up dynamic behavior is modeled through several sequence steps to simulate the physical processes inside the distillation column. Modeling the distillation apparatus under the batch mode of operation is one of the challenging simulations as the system displays a complex behavior during the start-up period. Since the switch between the model's correlations might result in discontinuous behavior, a new model is developed for the batch processes in the distillation column. An accurate and consistent initialization of the batch system is used in the mathematical modeling. From Fig. 4, the vapor flows upwards to the stage above and the liquid stage flows to the stage below. From the stage of rectification and feed scheme, in each stage, a vapor stream, V, and liquid stream, L, enter the stage, and leave the stage in equilibrium. In this section, it is assumed that at each tray, there is an ideal uniform liquid and vapor mixture leaving the stage at the thermal equilibrium. The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) is reached in each tray in the column. The dynamic behavior of the low-pressure process of the pressure swing distillation process for the separation of the HCl/water binary maximum boiling azeotrope is derived based on the overall and component mass and energy balance equations (Farsi et al., 2019b; Mulia-Soto and Flores-Tlacuahuac, 2011). The column segments are rectification, stripping, feed, re-boiler and condenser sections with N trays including the condenser and re-boiler. With respect to Fig. 4, the mass balance of the rectification section can be written as follows: (1) d m i d t = m ˙ L i − 1 + m ˙ V i + 1 − m ˙ L i − m ˙ V 1 The liquid and vapor phase inlet and outlet of stage “i” are assumed to follow the mass balance in each tray. In the vapor and liquid flows, the component mass balance based on the more volatile component can be expressed as: (2) d ( m i x i ) d t = m ˙ L i − 1 x i − 1 + m ˙ V i + 1 y i + 1 − m ˙ L i x i − m ˙ V i y i where x and y denote the mole fraction of the more volatile liquid phase and vapor phase component respectively (Farsi et al., 2019b). The energy balance equation for the rectification section for the low pressure side can be written as follows (Mulia-Soto and Flores-Tlacuahuac, 2011; Gañí et al., 1986; Naterer, 2020): (3) d ( m i h i ) d t = m ˙ L i − 1 h L i − 1 + m ˙ V i + 1 h V i + 1 − m ˙ L i h L i − m ˙ V i h V i + Q ˙ h e a t The summation equation can be expressed as (4) ∑ i ( x k i − y k i ) = 0 The UNIQRK model is implemented to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the HCl(aq) azeotropic binary mixture and the vapor-liquid equilibrium. This model can show the azeotropic point of the HCl(aq) solution. It is not applicable in the phase diagrams. The thermo-physical properties of the HCl(aq) solution were calculated and reported in past literature (Farsi et al., 2019a; Farsi et al., 2019b; Saravi and Honarparvar, 2018). These incorporate an e_NRTL model to estimate the vapor and liquid enthalpy calculations in trays. The activity coefficient, partial pressure of the aqueous solution, K-value and HCl dissociation solution required for showing the phase diagram have a reasonable agreement with the experimental data (Farsi et al., 2019b; Saravi and Honarparvar, 2018). As mentioned before, the activity coefficient equations and Murphree efficiency (ɛ n, i ) are formulated based on the e-NRTL and UNIQAC models. The vapor phase is considered as an ideal gas. (5) y i , n p n = x i γ i , n p i v a p (6) ε n , i = y n , i − y n − 1 , i y n , i * − y n − 1 , i The mass balance and energy balance equations for the re-boiler of the low-pressure columns can be expressed as: (7) d m N d t = m ˙ L N − 1 − m ˙ V N − m ˙ B (8) d ( m N x N ) d t = m ˙ L N − 1 x N − 1 − m ˙ V N y N − m ˙ B x B (9) d ( m N h N ) d t = m ˙ L N − 1 h L N − 1 − m ˙ V N h V N − m ˙ B h B + Q ˙ R e b o i l e r It is assumed that total condensation occurs in the condenser thereby indicating that the vapor is completely condensed. So the overall and component mass balance equations for the reflux condenser are obtained as follows. (10) d m 1 d t = m ˙ V 2 − m ˙ L 1 − m ˙ D (11) d ( m 1 x 1 ) d t = m ˙ V 2 y 2 − m ˙ L 1 x 1 − m ˙ D x D The energy equation for the steam condenser of the atmospheric distillation column can be written as: (12) d ( m 1 h 1 ) d t = m ˙ V 2 h V 2 − m ˙ L 1 h L 1 − m ˙ D h D + Q ˙ c o n d The heat transfer coefficient and physical properties of the aqueous solution are extracted from past literature (Farsi et al., 2019a; Farsi et al., 2019b). Correlations of a Francis weir were applied for the hydrodynamic behavior of the pressure drop over the trays: (13) Δ p n = Δ p d , n + Δ p h , n + Δ p r , n (14) Δ p d , n = ξ v ρ n v ( w n v ) 2 2 (15) Δ p h , n = h f l ρ n L g The pressure drop may also affect the vapor stream of a tray which is taken into account via: (16) V ˙ i n , n = A a c t i v e M ¯ n ( 2 Δ p d , n ρ n v ξ v ) Moreover, the condenser outflow can be estimated according to the Francis weir formulation as an extra tray condition. (17) m ˙ o u t , c o n d = ρ n L l w M ¯ L ( h o w 750 ) 1.5 In order to simulate the dynamic behavior of the low pressure side of the batch distillation apparatus during the start-up operation, initial values are needed. The common procedure for generating initial values like allocating a tray as the feed concentration at the corresponding equilibrium condition is not applicable for the batch distillation process in this study. Instead this paper will use a reactive distillation column. In order to study the dynamic behavior of the batch atmospheric distillation column, different correlation sets are incorporated depending on the specific conditions. In the start-up period, changing dynamics of thermodynamic variables occurs at the column. This paper incorporates a modified version of the Albet Le Lann model (Albet et al., 1994a, 1994b) by introducing the plate filling ratio as an additional parameter. The filling ratio (also called local vapor generation event) can be defined as the value of the liquid hold-up wherein the plate is hot enough to produce vapor flowing up from the plate. It is assumed that at the start-up time, vapor is migrating from the plate below by the plate holes, while the liquid is held-up on the plate and consequently increases on the plate. In addition, once the liquid hold-up fills, the plate starts to heat up, while at the beginning the plate is not producing vapor. In this model, only the filling ratio parameter determines the dynamic behavior. With respect to the initial condition of the distillation column, it varies between 0 to1. The simplicity of this model is a main benefit, although it is not capable of including some conditions like the filled trays with liquid falling down before filling the condenser and introducing the reflux flow. For the dynamic modeling of the batch distillation process, consistent initial values based on the initial conditions are necessary in the simulation procedures. In this respect, an empty and cold column state are required as the initial starting condition. Following the reactive distillation model (Reepmeyer et al., 2004), during the start-up period, different phases can be identified. From an empty column, the boiler is filled up with 5 M HCl(aq) azeotropic solution at the ambient temperature. Once three heaters are turned on, the column starts warming until it reaches the designated temperature set by the multi-zone controller. When the liquid level is higher than the weir height on a tray, the liquid moves down into the lower tray. Once the re-boiler temperature reaches the boiling temperature, the first vapor stream is generated and moves into the upper stages. Since the upper parts of the column are not warm enough, the vapor stream is condensed totally and accumulated on the tray. This condensed liquid is then heated by the vapor rising from the re-boiler. Once the temperature and vapor pressure in the tray reaches the boiling point, the state of the tray becomes vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE). The vapor from this tray is rising to the upper level tray and then it is condensed. VLE is achieved from the bottom to the top trays and finally the top vapor condenses in the water-cooled condenser. From a dynamic behavior analysis of the batch distillation, the start-up time will end when all trays are in the VLE state and the liquid hold-up for the all trays reaches its weir height. Different equations are take into account when studying the dynamic behavior of the batch atmospheric distillation process. Therefore, the correlation sets are presented based on the defined conditions as follows. a) When the level on the tray is more than the weir height from the Francis weir formula (Eq. (14)) the liquid starts leaving the tray and no weeping through the bubbles exists. i f p n ≥ p n − 1 t h e n m ˙ o u t , c o n d = ρ n L l w M ¯ L ( h o w 750 ) 1.5 m ˙ o u t , c o n d = 0 b) When the pressure in the prior stage is higher than the pressure on the tray or condenser (Eq. (13)), vapor starts moving toward the tray or condenser when leaving a tray. i f l e v e l ≥ h w t h e n V ˙ i n , n = A a c t i v e M ¯ n ( 2 Δ p d , n ρ n v ξ v ) V ˙ i n , n = 0 c) If the vapor-liquid boiling temperature is lower than the temperature of the vapor outlet at the same stage, the phase equilibrium (Eq. (8)) is considered. If not, the equilibrium condition cannot be applied and it is required to substitute correlations to maintain the number of equations constant given the concentration (molar-based) with a value for the numerical calculation. i f T o u t , n ≥ T b o i l t h e n y ( i , n ) p n = x i γ ( i , n ) p i v a p · E l s e y i , n = x i , n The following steps are used in simulating the batch distillation column. When the temperature of the boiler reaches the bubble point, the vapor moving up is then condensing on the upper plate and gradually filling up the plate. In the hydrodynamic relation, it requires T n − T n b = 0 instead of V ˙ n = 0 . Moreover, in plate n-1, when the liquid hold-up reaches the filling ratio (α), vapor migration to the upper plate begins. It means that when ν n − 1 − α ν n − 1 m a x = 0 , the constraint V ˙ n = 0 is replaced by T n − 1 − T n − 1 b = 0 . When the condenser part is fully filled, the fixed reflux or total reflux is introduced and the tray at the top fills up for the ( 1 − α ) fraction. So at the event of ν 1 − ν 1 m a x = 0 , the constraint L ˙ = 0 is substituted by u 1 − m u 1 ( T 1 , P 1 , x 1 i ) = 0 . When the top tray is filled up completely, the liquid falls down to the lower plate. The plates gradually fill up. Thus, with the event, ν k − ν k m a x = 0 , the constraint L ˙ = 0 is substituted by u k − m u k ( T k , P k , x k i ) = 0 . Finally, once the bottom plate is filled up completely, the discontinuous stage finishes."
3,Results and discussion,"As mentioned earlier, the distillation unit in the lab-scale Cu-Cl cycle is a key apparatus for recovering the oxidized anolyte leaving the CuCl/HCl(aq) electrolyzer. Due to a lack of experimental data for the atmospheric distillation of an HCl(aq) azeotropic solution in the literature, this study intends to present comprehensive simulations and experimental data for future system analysis. Temperature profiles through the low pressure columns characterize the batch distillation process through recorded experimental data. From the experimental study, an accurate measurement of dynamic characteristics of the discontinuous stage for the batch distillation at the start-up period is achieved. Aspen Plus software provides the thermo-physical properties of the HCl(aq) azeotropic mixture with the help of empirical correlations in the estimation of saturation pressures, binary interaction parameters, activity coefficients and chemical equilibrium constant parameters. In addition, EES software is implemented to model the dynamic behavior of the atmospheric batch distillation process. Fig. 5 shows the measured and simulated temperature profiles at the re-boiler section. Initially, the filling coefficient is set to 0.96. The filling coefficient is assumed constant along the distillation column. In the experiment, the boiler temperature is set to 108 °C (boiling temperature of the HCl(aq) at the specific species concentration) by the multi-zone controller device. Increasing the boiler temperature speeds up the batch distillation process, wherein less time for separation of water from HCl results in an undesirable concentration of the top and bottom products. Operation of the atmospheric distillation column close to 100 °C allows the more volatile component (in the low pressure side where the more volatile component is water) to be separated from the HCl component. This situation would be comparable with the case that has an increase of re-boiler temperature (up to 120 °C), and both HCl and water start to vaporize which leads to the presence of acid in the condensed product at the top. At a lower operating temperature, there is more available time for the components of the solution to be separated from each other and consequently more desirable concentrations at the top and bottom products. Fig. 6 illustrates the molar based concentration of the bottom product during the start-up period for experimental and predicted results. Since the batch process operating temperature is low (changes between 101 °C and 110 °C) compared to the high temperature operation (above 120 °C), the bottom product concentration at the beginning of the experiment (first hour) is not sufficiently concentrated (near a value of 0.11). This is mainly due to less generated vapor from the boiling part where some part of the solution moves toward the bottom vessel with no change in the acid concentration. Over time and with generation of more vapor, more water as the more volatile component in the low pressure side is separated from the azeotropic solution. According to Fig. 6, the desired HCl molar concentration is obtained after 5 h. The batch distillation process is continued until the desired bottom concentration achieved. It should be mentioned that the bottom product feeds the high pressure columns in the lab-scale PSDU apparatus. Figs. 7 and 8 show the stripping and rectification section temperature profiles from the simulation and experimental studies. As can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the dynamic behavior modeling of the batch atmospheric distillation column for the HCl(aq) solution shows good agreement with the experimental observation. The stripping and rectification sections are set at an average temperature below 108 °C to avoid creating a superheated vapor at the condenser part in the top which may prevent condensation. The experimental outcomes show the actual behavior of the PSDU under specific measurement errors. The the model results illustrate the behavior of that unit based on its theoretical mode. Based on Figs. 7 and 8, the maximum discrepancy between the experimental and simulation results is found to be 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Fig. 9 shows the condenser temperature profile in both experimental and dynamic predictive simulations. From Fig. 9, at the first hour of operation, the condenser temperature is around the ambient temperature since there is not enough vapor at the top and consequently no condensation. The same procedure happened in the last hour of the start-up operation as there is not enough vapor to be condensed at the condenser from where the condenser temperature drops down to the ambient temperature. Fig. 10 shows the acid molar fraction in the top product for 8 samples. It is shown that the concentration of HCl species at the top is close to zero and does not undergo any significant change during the batch distillation process. This indicated the viable operation of the low pressure side in the lab-scale PSDU apparatus."
4,Uncertainty analysis results,"4.1 Uncertainty analysis results In the experimental study, although measures were taken to correct systematic errors, the data from a measurement is still only an estimation of the true measured value. To confirm the accuracy of data obtained from the experimental study, it is necessary to perform an uncertainty analysis. Typically the main sources of errors come from the practical operating condition (random or precision error) and from the measuring instruments (systematic error). Random error cannot be controlled and it is estimated by repeating the experiment to analyze the associated standard deviations and uncertainties in the measurements. The primary sources of uncertainty come from imperfect instrument performance in reading bias from equipment, uncontrolled environmental conditions leading to effects on the system's components, and finite instrument resolution. In this experimental study, an uncertainty propagation tool was applied via Equation Engineering Solver to estimate the uncertainty of the measured data based on a past NIST Technical Note (Taylor, 1994; Kline and McClintock, 1953). The sources of uncertainties in the estimated values and measured data are presented in Table 1 ."
5,Conclusions,"An experimental study of pressure swing distillation for separation of an HCl(aq) homogeneous azeotropic mixture was presented for a discontinuous (batch) process. A rigorous model was presented for a batch distillation unit. The model considers the dynamic behavior of the system performance which is verified through a series of experiments. The experiments were performed in two ways – first with a high operating temperature and less process time; while in the second, a moderate temperature and comparatively more hours of operation. From the empirical results, the desired product concentrations are achieved by the last operation procedure in which the binary solution finds enough time for the repetitive vaporization and condensation and consequently the more separation of the solution's components. The results indicate that with a 5 M HCl(aq) concentration at the feed section of the low pressure column, the purity of the top and bottom products after around 7 h reach the desired amount of 0.047 M and 6.2 M, respectively. This indicates a 24% increase at the bottom compared to the feed concentration."
