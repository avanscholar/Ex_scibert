0,Introduction,"Over the past several decades, the concept of biorefinery has attained a smorgasbord of attentions, since the excessive consumption of fossil fuels and triggered environmental pollution have become more serious. Lignocellulosic biomass consists of carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose) and polymers of aromatic, namely lignin(Li et al., 2020). Cellulose and hemicellulose could be fully utilized through the production of cellulosic ethanol and platform products at a high efficiency, while lignin was exploited in an inefficient and environmental-unfriendly way, such as direct burning(Wu et al., 2021). However, the application of alkali lignin (AL) has been hindered due to its natural recalcitrance and complex structure. Furthermore, the foaming or swelling in AL pyrolysis are challenges for continuous processing in industry. Therefore, it is pivotal to develop an advantageous and promising method to convert AL into high-value products, for example, bio-based products, which could keep the processing cost effective and encourage the holistic utilization of solid waste as part of the development of circular economies(Budarin et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2016). Through thermochemical process, lignin can be converted into three types of products, namely syngas, bio-oil, and biochar. Among the thermochemical methods, pyrolysis is the most common and feasible method for biomass conversion(Li et al., 2018). Syngas could be converted into liquid hydrocarbons and high-value added chemicals via Fischer-tropsch synthesis(FTS) (Yan et al., 2013). Bio-oil could be upgraded to deoxygenated hydrocarbon fuels or high-value chemicals, for instance cyclohexanol or cyclohexanone via hydrodeoxygenation (Ha et al., 2019). Biochars have many merits, such as developed pore structure, abundant surface functional groups and high surface area. These properties attribute to biochars high reactivity and wide application in many areas, such as carbon capture(Oliveira et al., 2017), soil remediation and compost(Qiu et al., 2020), wastewater treatment(Cho et al., 2019), catalyst(Han et al., 2020), and energy storage(Liu et al., 2019). Many efforts have been made for the valorisation of biochars, which could be stemmed from different feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass(Lian et al., 2020; Tayier et al., 2020), or the primary component, lignin(Liu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021). Burrell et al. (2016) explored the ability of four kinds of biochars derived from the mixed woodchips, wheat straw and vineyard-prunings at 525 °C and 400 °C to improve the nature of agricultural soils, where the woodchips biochar manifested the greatest effect on the improvement of bulk density and soil aggregate stability. Liu et al. (2019) directly pyrolyzed kraft lignin to prepare N, O, and S co-doped hierarchical porous carbons and the as-prepared biochars were successfully converted into sustainable high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials. It was found that high-level heteroatom doping (N, O, P, or S) improves wettability and conductivity as well as pseudocapacitance via Faradaic reactions. The production conditions (feedstock, temperature, atmosphere, and types of pyrolysis) had a strong impact on the yields and properties of biochars (Tripathi et al., 2016). Zhang et al. (2020b) explored how pyrolysis temperature (300, 400, 500 and 600 ℃) and types of biomass (wheat straw, corn straw, rape straw and rice straw) affected the physicochemical properties of biochars, and found that elevated pyrolysis temperature had a positive impact on the formation of a crystal structure in the straw biochars. The properties of biochars could be enhanced or modified by different methods, such as physical or chemical activation, composite modification, post heteroatoms doping modification, and biological modification(Li et al., 2020). Yoon et al. (2019) introduced a novel and cost-effective method to process kraft lignin with red mud under CO2 atmosphere, where CO2 as the reaction medium enhanced the porosity of biochars and the prepared biochars had an excellent performance on the reduction of p-nitrophenol and Cr(Ⅵ). Luo et al. (2018) modified biochars from corncob with acrylonitrile, and the related characteristics showed that only BC-350 (obtained at 350 ℃) was modified successfully, and the corresponding Cd adsorption capacity was 85.65 mg/g. Therefore, it is meaningful to valorise AL in an economical and environmental-friendly way, and there still needs more attentions and researches. In the present work, AL was chosen as the feedstock because of its abundance, and a simple and low-cost pretreatment method to process AL through slow pyrolysis was adopted. Then the physicochemical properties of biochars were determined by various techniques, such as SEM, TEM, and XRD. Additionally, GC-MS and GC were used to analyze the monophenols in bio-oil. For further valorisation of biochars, the use of which as catalyst and adsorbent was explored. The results showed that the pretreatment of nickel salts modified the foaming or swelling of AL successfully. Biochar from the pretreated AL by Ni(NO3)2 showed effective performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to prepare aniline, and biochar from the pretreated AL by (CH3COO)2Ni had a certain adsorption capacity for lead (Pb) in aqueous solution."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials AL was provided by Rizhao Huatai Paper Co., Ltd. (Shandong province, China) and it was acquired by acid precipitation of sulfate pulping black liquor. The received AL was washed with ultrapure water and then freeze-dried for later use. Then, the AL was analyzed by Elemental analysis (EA), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Nickel salts, including Ni(NO3)2, NiSO4, (CH3COO)2Ni and NiCl2, were directly used after purchased. All chemicals used were of analytical grade."
3,The pretreatment of AL,"2.2 The pretreatment of AL The volume of 5 g alkali lignin was about 15 mL measured by cylinder. Then 5 g of AL was mixed with 15 mL salt solution at room temperature where the ratio of lignin to water was 1:1 (v/v) and the ratio of nickel to lignin was equivalent to 1:20(g/g). The aim of the ratio of lignin to solution (1:1, v/v) was for well mixing between salt solution and alkali lignin powder. The mixtures were stirred continuously for 5 min in order that nickel salts could be dispersed evenly in lignin powders. Then the mixtures were freeze-dried at −105 ℃ and 80 mT (10.6 pa) until the moisture sublimated completely."
4,Slow pyrolysis of pretreated AL,"2.3 Slow pyrolysis of pretreated AL Slow pyrolysis of pretreated AL was performed on the fixed bed reactor. Details about the pyrolysis rig could be found in previous work(Wang et al., 2020a). About 4 g of pretreated AL were placed into the inner tube, and the equipment was purged for 10 min using nitrogen gas to ensure the inert atmosphere before pyrolysis. The tube furnace was heated up to 600 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min, and then maintained at the designated temperature for 2 h. Biochars were retrieved from the inner tube after the apparatus was cooled naturally. These biochars were marked as AW600, AA600, AN600, AC600, and AS600, where A meant alkali lignin, W/A/N/C/S meant the pretreatment with water, nickel acetate, nickel nitrate, nickel chloride and nickel sulfate, and the suffix referred to the final temperature in degrees Celsius. The biochar samples were used directly for further characterization and application exploration without further treatment."
5,Characterization of biochars,"2.4 Characterization of biochars The elemental composition of biochars, including C, H, N and S, were determined by Elemental analyzer (EA, Euro EA 3000). A small amount of sample underwent dynamic flash combustion being converted into nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide through oxidation and reduction. These gases were separated and detected by chromatography. Finally the converted components were determined by the thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and then the content of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur in the sample were gotten. The ash content was determined according to proximate analysis of solid biofuels (GB/T 28731–2012), where 0.5–0.6 g of sample was heated to 250 ℃ at the rate of 5 ℃/min and held for 1 h, then heated to 550 ℃ at the same heating rate and held for 2 h. The micro morphology and structure of biochars were monitored by Scanning Electron Microscope- Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS; SU3500 Aztec X-Max2) and TEM (TECNAI G220 TWIN, working at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV). For SEM-EDS, the biochar samples were ground to fine powder and the powder sprinkled on the sample table were gilded for better conductivity before test. For TEM, the biochar powder samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol at room temperature for 15 min, and the obtained solution was deposited onto copper grids for TEM analysis. The crystalline structure of biochars were acquired by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Bruker-D2) using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å, 40 kV and 25 mA) with a scanning range (2θ) of 10 ° to 80 ° at 2.5 °/min). The particle size of the crystal phase was calculated by the Scherrer formula. Surface areas of biochars were determined on Brumauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, ASAP 2460 Version 3.01) based on N2 adsorption methods, and the pore volume and pore size distribution of biochars were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Before analysis, 0.12 g samples were heated to 300 ℃ for 6 h in vacuum."
6,The application of biochars,"2.5 The application of biochars 2.5.1 The selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene To gain an insight into the catalysis performance of the as-prepared biochars(Liu et al., 2015), 100 mg of biochar and 1 mmol of nitrobenzene were added into the stainless-steel autoclave and 50 mL of methanol were added as solvent. Before starting the reaction, the rig was purged with H2 twice to exclude air in the reactor. The initial pressure of H2 was set as 2 MPa and the reactor was heated up from room temperature to 150 ℃ and remained for 2 h with continuous stirring (400 rmp). The resulting mixture was collected after the apparatus was cooled to room temperature. The analysis of the products was performed with GC-FID (PerkinElmer Clarus GC). 2.5.2 Adsorption experiments A certain weight of Pb(NO3)2 were dissolved by ultrapure water(18.25 mΩ cm−1) to prepare the stock solution of 400 mg/L Pb(Ⅱ), and the pH value was 4.67. Moreover, 0.01 M of NaNO3 solution was used to maintain a stable ionic strength(Lian et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021), then the stock solution was diluted to the desired concentration. A common adsorption capacity experiment was carried out by adding 100 mg biochars into 50 mL of adsorbate solution. The mixtures were shaken at 200 rpm and 25 ℃ for 24 h. After reaching the designated time, about 1 mL of mixtures were sampled and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter membrane. The content of Pb was determined by ICP-AES after dilution and acidification. The adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out using 400 mg/mL of stock solution with 0.1 g biochar at different time intervals (0/5/10/15/30/60/120/180 min) at 25 ℃. Meanwhile, pseudo-first-order kinetic model (Formula 3) and pseudo-second-order kinetic models (Formula 4) were used to probe the adsorption capacity of Pb (Ⅱ) onto biochar (Liu et al., 2021a). (1) Q t = v ( C 0 - C t ) m (2) Q e = v ( C 0 - C e ) m (3) ln Q e - Q t = l n qQ e - k 1 t (4) t Q t = 1 k 2 Q e 2 + 1 Q e t where C0 and Ct refer to the initial and equilibrium contents of Pb(Ⅱ) in solution (mg/L); V is the volume of stock solution (L) and m is the weight of biochar sample; Qe and Qt were the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and t time (min) of Pb (Ⅱ), respectively; k1 (min−1) and k2 (g·mg−1·min−1) represent equilibrium rate constant of two models, respectively. The adsorption isotherms were performed with various initial concentrations of Pb(II) (100/150/200/250/300/350/400 mg/L) at 25 ℃ for 12 h. Thereafter, the supernatant was taken to determine the concentration at equilibrium condition (Ce ). The isotherm studies were depicted by using Langmuir (Formula 5) and Freundlich (Formula 6) adsorption isotherm models(Wu et al., 2021). (5) Q e = K L Q m C e 1 + K L C e (6) Q e = K F × C e 1 / n Ce (mg/L), KL (L/mg) and Qm (mg/g) represent the concentration of Pb (Ⅱ) in the solution under isothermal conditions, the Langmuir coefficient and the single-layer adsorption capacity of the adsorbate, respectively. KF (mg/g (mg/L3)n) was the coefficient of Freundlich while n is the coefficient of heterogeneity."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The properties of alkali lignin,"3.1 The properties of alkali lignin FT-IR was used to reveal the functional groups of AL. According to literature(Liu et al., 2021b; Lv et al., 2018; Soongprasit et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019), all characteristic bonds were assigned and the results were shown in Table 1 . A wide and large peak at 3358 cm−1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of –OH, including phenolic –OH and aliphatic –OH, while the peak at 1368 cm−1 was due to the plane deformation of phenolic –OH. The two absorption peaks at 2939 and 2840 cm−1 were related to the stretching vibration of aliphatic CH, while the peaks at 1637, 1602, 1511 and 1422 cm−1 represented the skeletal vibrations of aromatic ring in AL. Since AL was precipitated from sulfate pulping black liquor of coniferous wood, more characteristic peaks of guaiacol units (G) were found in FT-IR spectrum. The peaks at 1269, 1129 and 849 cm−1 referred to the stretching vibrations of CO bonds in G units, aromatic CH stretching of G units and CH out-of-plane vibrations in positions 2, 5 and 6 of G units, respectively. Additionally, the peak at 1085 cm−1 was related to CO deformation at Cβ position and aliphatic ether while the peak at 1030 cm−1 corresponded to the deformation vibration of CO in secondary and primary alcohols or aliphatic ethers. The peak of aromatic ring breathing with CO or CO stretching vibration was found at 1214 cm−1, however, the peaks of unconjugated or conjugated CO were missing. It was speculated that CO groups were heavily modified or damaged by the harsh extraction process from paper-making industry(Zhang et al., 2020a). The inorganic elements in AL were determined by ICP-AES. The content of sodium was up to 0.48 wt%, while the total content of identified inorganic elements were 0.71 wt%. The high content of sodium in AL was originated from the fact that AL was derived from kraft pulp, which was obtained by cooking lignocellulosic biomass with a chemical solution containing sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. Moreover, the contents of C, H, N and S were determined and shown in Table 2 , as 56.10 wt%, 5.05 wt%, 0.45 wt% and 2.18 wt%, respectively. The content of O was obtained by mass balance according to the formula: O (wt%) = 100%-(C%+H%+S%+N%)-Ash%(Pariyar et al., 2020). Compared to native lignocellulosic biomass, the high carbon content of aromatic structure made lignin potential to be used to develop advanced carbon materials(Wang et al., 2021). The ash in AL reached 1.9 wt%, which might be due to inorganic element introduced by preparation process or mineral materials needed for growth. TG-DTG curves revealed the thermal degradation behaviors of AL, and the thermal degradation of AL happened in a wide range of temperature, as shown in Fig. 1 . The DTG curve of AL displayed two major maximum thermal degradation temperatures around 92 and 363 ℃ and the thermal degradation process could be subdivided into two stages based on the DTG profile. The first stage around 92 ℃ was assigned to the loss of water in AL sample. The second stage around 363 ℃ showed a maximum thermal degradation of AL, corresponding to the release of aromatic volatile matter(Chen et al., 2020). For inorganic element, Na, K, Ca, and Si were the dominant and all of the four elements accounted for 0.67% of lignin. All these inorganic elements might remain in the solid residue after heating process, including TGA and pyrolysis. So the 53.4% of solid residue for alkali lignin at 600 ℃ contained these inorganic elements, which also could be supported by the EDS results. Furthermore, the degradation rate at 600 ℃ was close to zero and the residue mass was about 53.4 wt% which was an advantageous temperature for the preparation of biochar."
9,The status of the products derived from the pretreated AL,"3.2 The status of the products derived from the pretreated AL The photographs in supplementary information compared the visual appearance of the pretreated AL prior to pyrolysis, biochars and bio-oils derived from pretreated AL with water and different nickel salts. There was no obvious difference between the pretreated AL, and all the samples showed a dark brown color in fine powder status. Bio-oils evolved from different pretreated AL samples showed remarkable discrepancy. Transparent and colorless liquids could be observed in bio-oils from AW600, AC600 and AS600, while the bio-oils from AN600 and AA600 appeared as transparent but bright yellow liquids. It was surmised that nickel salts influenced obviously the pyrolysis behaviors of AL so that there could be distinction in the composition and quality of these bio-oils. With regard to the biochar products, the physical status has changed a lot. Compared to AW600 in a foaming status, the volume of another four biochar samples narrowed obviously. AN600, AA600 and AC600 showed in fine powder while AW600 and AS600 were in a lump status. It was apparent that the pretreatment with different nickel salts modified the foaming or swelling of AL during heating process, and the inhibition effect of nickel salts on the foaming or swelling of AL showed in the following sequence: Ni(NO3)2 > (CH3COO)2Ni > NiCl2 > NiSO4. The pretreatment with Ni(NO3)2, (CH3COO)2Ni and NiCl2 avoided the pyrolysis rig being blocking caused by the foaming or swelling of AL, making the continuous pyrolysis of AL possible in industry. According to Zhou et al. (2015), the agglomeration of lignin upon heating might be owing to the existence of phenolic hydroxyl, carboxyl acid and aldehyde groups in lignin. They found that the pretreatment with Ca(OH)2 could inhibit the melting and agglomeration of a wide range of technical lignins. In the present work, the presence of Ni might occupy the active site in lignin structure, which inhibited the foaming or swelling of AL. These nickel salts showed difference in the decomposition temperature owing to the difference in anions, which resulted in the distinct modification ability in char foaming. In fact, the anion of nickel salts did not exist as the former state after pyrolysis. CH3COO− and NO3 − might be decomposed into gaseous products, and Cl− might be transferred into three phase products. The SO4 2− was converted into NixSy which would be discussed in XRD and EDS analysis. Besides, the conversion of anion during thermal process might contribute to the variation of SSA and TPV in biochar samples. Additionally, the modification of pyrolysis equipment also could inhibit the foaming of biochar. Park et al. (2019) used the bench -scale rotary kiln reactor to pyrolyze organsolv lignin and the rig could get fine powder of biochar through thermal process but the refit of pyrolysis rig was time-consuming and energy-consuming."
10,The characteristic of biochars,"3.3 The characteristic of biochars The yields and the elemental analysis of biochars were listed in Table 2, while the content of O was calculated by mass balance(Pariyar et al., 2020). All types of nickel salts increased the yield of biochars which meant that nickel salts promoted the formation biochars. In the work of Collard et al. (2012), the impregnation of Ni(NO3)2 also increased the yields of biochars stemmed from microcrystalline cellulose and alkali lignin. The content of C decreased a lot from 87.49% to 69.47%, which was still higher than the biochars evolved from lignocellulosic biomass. Lian et al. (2020) prepared biochars from invasive plant species at 350/450/550 ℃, and the contents of C were around the range from 60% to 70%, which were much lower than the biochars derived from lignin. In the view of Li et al. (2020) and Jiang et al. (2020), lignin-rich feedstocks were conducive to produce biochars with high fixed carbon content and developed pore structure. Thence, lignin was an excellent candidate for the production of carbon materials. On the other hand, the decrease of C content demonstrated that Ni was clearly deposited in carbon matrix. The content of S in AS600 was higher than other biochars, which meant that S from NiSO4 might still remain in the biochar because of the high decomposition temperature of NiSO4. Furthermore, the content of N in AN600 was higher than in other materials which might be owing to the formation of function group containing N. According to Wang et al. (2021) and Yuan et al. (2018), the doping of N atoms in metal based catalysts can enhance the lattice of carbon materials to be slightly deformed and form defects, which might contribute to the catalytic performance. The H/C and O/C molar ratio represented the degree of aromaticity and polarity of biochars, respectively (Pariyar et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b). In comparison to AW600, the aromaticity of other biochars were enhanced, indicating that the aromatic structure of lignin remained in the biochars. The O/C ratio of AC600 and AS600 revealed that the two biochars had more polar functional groups and stronger hydrophilicity compared to AW600. The specific surface area (SSA), total pore volume (TPV) and average pore diameter of the as-prepared biochars were summarized in Table 3 . The specific surface area and total pore volume of AW600 were relatively low, being 30.7 m2/g and 0.0113 cm3/g, which might be owing to the fact that lignin was nonporous material(Han et al., 2020). Ronsse et al. (2013) thought that the formation of pore in biochar was due to the release of volatile matters upon heating, and the pretreatment of nickel salts on AL all enhanced the release of volatile matters from lignin structure in the present work, so the textural structure of as-prepared biochars changed notably. The BET surface area of AA600, AN600, AC600 and AS600 were 414.2, 446.0, 399.6 and 435.6 m2/g, respectively. The pore size distribution curves showed that there was only micropores in AW600. In addition, a bit mesopores appeared in AC600 and AS600 while micropores, mesopores and macropores co-existed in AA600 and AN600. According to Liu et al. (2019), the co-existence of macropores, mesopores, and micropores, was notably beneficial to the fast transfer and diffusion ability of ions and thus enhance the electrochemical performance. The four salts all benefited the generation of mesopores while the pretreatment of Ni(NO3)2 and (CH3COO)2Ni contributed to the formation of macropores. To sum up, these results declared that the pretreatment by nickel salts had an effect for pore structure expansion while Ni(NO3)2 and (CH3COO)2Ni performed the best. The variation of the nickel species was monitored by XRD. According to Debye-Scherrer formula, the particle sizes of the identified species were calculated and the results were listed in Table 4 . First of all, the two broad peaks located at 22° and 44° were ascribed to (002) and (100) of amorphous carbon structure(Li et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019). Ni0 (PDF#04–0850) and Ni4S3(PDF#52-1027) were found in AA600 and AN600. The formation of Ni0 might be due to the reduction of Ni2+ by the char and gas generated during pyrolysis process(Shen & Yoshikawa, 2014; Wang et al., 2021). Similar results were obtained by Eibner et al. (2015), where both Cu0 and Ni0 nanoparticles were generated when they pretreated eucalyptus with metal nitrate to explore the catalytic pyrolysis. The formation of Ni4S3 was owing to the small amount of sulfur contained in AL, which interacted with Ni atom to generate the substance. Except for Ni0 and Ni4S3, NiS2 (PDF#11-0099) appeared in AC600. The species of Ni in biochar were more complicated when the content of sulfur increased in raw material, and the new particle of Ni3S2(PDF#44-1418) appeared in AS600. Said et al. (2018) concluded that the formation of Ni3S2 phase inhibited the volatilization of sulfur during thermal process. These results revealed that there was competition between nickel and sulfur in the reduction reaction occurred during pyrolysis process. Unfortunately, the mechanism and sequence of reduction still remained unknown and more researches were needed to be done. The SEM images depicted completely the different morphology of these biochars. AW600 was with smooth and non-pore surface in tight block structure, which resulted in the low specific surface area and total pore volume. The surface of AA600 was covered by smooth flaky species, while AN600 showed rough surface in molten status. However, the AC600 and the AS600 both showed fragmented surface, which appeared cracked and collapsed. Differently, AC600 developed more visual pore structure and the broken of surface for AS600 was weaker. Surface deformation and collapse contributed to the formation of advanced carbon materials with high SSA and developed pore structure. In general, different nickel salts did make a strong modification on the textural and morphological surface of biochars through changing the pyrolysis behaviors of AL. EDS results showed the distribution of element on the surface of biochar samples, which were in accordance with the ICP-AES results of AL, that is, Na, K, Si, and Ca were all detected by EDS and ICP-AES. In addition, N was only detected in AN600; Cl was only detected in AC600; the content of S increased a lot in AS600 compared with the other four biochar samples, which revealed the fate of element in anion. The TEM image of AW600 appeared mainly bulk carbon, and the same structure of lignin-biochar was observed by Li et al. (2021). Other TEM images pictured particles in different sizes where AC600 seemed to have two different sizes of particles because of the existence of Ni0 and NiS2, which could be evidenced by XRD spectra. As shown in TEM images, the particles were uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix while agglomeration of particles could be observed in AS600. Nano measurer software was used to analyze the size distribution of particles, and the average sizes were listed in Table 4. The results of TEM were almost in accordance with the value from Debye-Scherrer formula of XRD spectra. Except for AC600-1, the particle size of other groups distributed well. The difference of AS600 sample between XRD and TEM might due to the agglomeration of particles."
11,The characteristic of bio-oil,"3.4 The characteristic of bio-oil Small-molecular compounds were analyzed by GC-MS (Agilent 6890 N, Santa Clara) and the results revealed the effect of different nickel salts on the formation of monophenols. These monophenols were divided into two categories tinted in different colors. Owing to the raw materials evolved from coniferous wood, guaiacol and its derivatives colored in pink were observed. The catechol and its derivatives were the second category colored in green. The formation of catechol type might be due to the demethylation on the position at –OCH3 and then the H radical quickly combined to form stable substance. Compared to AW600, the bio-oil of AA600 showed no difference in product category; the peak of 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) propan-2-one was missing and the peak of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol appeared newly in bio-oil of AN600; bio-oil of AC600 lost the peak of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol while bio-oil of AS600 showed the new substance of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. To explicate the effect of nickel salts on bio-oil production, five mono-phenolic compounds were quantified by GC-FID (PerkinElmer Clarus GC, Waltham) and the variation of the content was consistent with the change of peak area in GC–MS spectra. In comparison with AW600, the total content of monophenols from pretreated samples decreased a lot from 4.01% to 1.35%. The variation in total content of monophenols demonstrated that nickel salts inhibited the depolymerization of lignin to small-molecular phenols and then the char yield increased. Furthermore, the content of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene in AC600 increased from 0.48% to 0.66% and the content of 4-methylguaiacol in AS600 increased from 0.55% to 1.07%. Accordingly (Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b), the pretreatment with nickel chloride contributed to the demethylation of –OCH3 to generate 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, while the pretreatment with nickel sulfate was conducive to the breakage of Cα-Cβ in side chain enhancing the production of 4-methylguaiacol."
12,The application of prepared biochars,"3.5 The application of prepared biochars Since the Ni0 particle embedded in carbon matrix might have the ability of catalyzing hydrogenation reaction, the biochars were applied to produce aniline from nitrobenzene in the present work. The results were shown in Fig. 2 (a). ICP-AES was used to detect if Ni was leached, the results showed that no Ni element was found in the reaction solution, indicating no leaching occurred. AW600 had no hydrogenation property, while AN600 yielded 80.5% of aniline and AA600 performed also quite well (72.5%). However, AC600 and AS600 performed poorly, yielding 10.9% and 20.1% of aniline. Aniline, an important chemical, was mainly used in the manufacture of dyes, drugs, resins, and a rubber vulcanization accelerator. A great deal of efforts had been made to produce aniline in an environmental-friendly and high-efficient way. Taheri-Ledari et al. (2020), Xu et al. (2019) and Sadjadi et al. (2019) used noble metal Ag, Rh and Pd respectively to fabricate catalyst for the conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline derivatives. Although a nice yield of aniline derivatives had been obtained in these works, the use of noble metal made the cost expensive and did not in favor of industrial application. According to Veerakumar et al. (2016), the reaction pathway of nitrobenzene hydrogenation could be summarized in four steps: the chemical adsorption of feedstocks on the catalyst; transfer of electron and hydrogen between solvent and reactant; the reaction of reactive H and feedstock; and the desorption of products. Therefore, we speculated that the Ni0 species embedded in the biochars played a key role in nitrobenzene hydrogenation. What’s more, the increased SSA and TPV also contributed to the adsorption of nitrobenzene, further promoting its hydrogenation. As supposed, smaller particle of Ni0 displayed stronger activity while the yield of aniline matched with the particle size of XRD and TEM. However, the AC600 and AS600 had more NixSy species which meant the content of the active Ni0 decreased, resulting in lower yield to aniline. The particle size of Ni0 increased notably in AC600 and AS600 that might influence the hydrogenation ability of biochars. According to the characterization results of as-prepared biochars, the SSA and TPV were enhanced strongly, which might contribute to the adsorption ability of materials. Therefore, the adsorption ability and capacity of lead(Ⅱ) of these biochars were tested and the results were shown in Fig. 2(b). Among these adsorbents, AA600 performed the best in the adsorption of lead with the capacity of 87.1 mg/g while biochar of AN600 went head to head with (86.0 mg/g). The adsorption kinetic and isotherm experiments were carried out with AA600 sample, which showed the largest adsorption capacity of Pb(Ⅱ). For adsorption isotherm, the correlation coefficient R2 of pseudo-second-order kinetics was higher than that of pseudo-first-order kinetics. In addition, Qe value from the experiment, pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and pseudo-second-order kinetic model were 87.1, 62.09 and 72.53 mg/g, respectively. The above two reasons indicated that the pseudo-second-order kinetic adsorption mechanism was dominant in the adsorption process. For adsorption kinetic, the correlation coefficient R2 of the Langmuir model was higher than that of the Freundlich model, which indicated single-layer adsorption. Zhang et al. (2019) prepared magnetic polyethyleneimine lignin by a reversed-phase suspension crosslinking method to adsorb Pb(Ⅱ) in aqueous solution and the as-prepared material could reach the maximum adsorption capacity of 96.60 mg/g. Kwak et al. (2019) post-treated biochars from sawdust, canola and wheat straw, and manure pellet by steam activation where the adsorption capacity for lead of biochar from canola increased from 108 mg/g to 195 mg/g after steam activation. Obviously, more modification methods needed to be done to improve the adsorption ability of biochar materials. According to Sizmur et al. (2017), charged ions and polar organic molecules could be removed positively from water by biochars with the effect of ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, physical sorption and precipitation. It was critical to modify the surface area and pore structure in order to expose active site of adsorption. Furthermore, the adsorbent needed to be conducive to separate from aqueous solution, such as Fe/Co/Ni-biochars with magnetism."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, this work introduced an economic process method for alkali lignin valorisation. The pretreatment with nickel salts improved the foaming or swelling in pyrolysis, notably changing the morphology and improving the pore structure of biochars. Moreover, Ni0 nanoparticles were generated in different size in biochars. AA600 reached a adsorption capacity of about 87.1 mg/g and AN600 yielded 80.5% aniline in nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Furthermore, the pretreatment with NiCl2 contributed to the formation of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, while Ni(SO4)2 enhanced the production of 4-methylguaiacol. Therefore, the results provided a novel orientation to valorise the widespread waste biomass, alkali lignin."
