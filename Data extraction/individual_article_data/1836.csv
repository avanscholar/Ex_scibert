0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a kind of plastic polymers with the normal formula [CH2CH(OH)]n. Because of its remarkable properties in film formation, adhesion, emulsifying, tensile strength and flexibility as well as resistance to oil, grease and solvents, PVA is widely used in various industries and in medicine directly or as a critical basic raw material like textiles and papermaking [1]. In recent years, PVA has been attracting increasing attention in the field of nano-materials production for the flexibility to modify [2,3]. The production of PVA has already arrived at 650,000 tons per year in 2001 worldwide [4], and is still increasing, especially in China [5,6]. Although PVA is reported to be biodegradable, it still remains as a huge threat to the environment [7]. First, the increasing demand and usage of PVA leads to enormous amount of PVA waste discharged to the environment every year, which exceeds the ecological carrying capacity and results in its accumulation in water system and soil. Second, because of the outstanding property of in emulsifying, they may exert strong surfactant activity and cause serious unexpected problems like accelerating the diffusion of other environmental contaminants and causing damages to plants. Particularly the nano- materials made of PVA which becomes highly popular in recent years can cause even more serious problems when carrying hazardous pollutants. The extensive use of PVA will likely continue for many years, making it urgent to investigate the impacts of PVA on the environment and find effective actions to prevent serous damages. The biodegradability of PVA is one of its advantageous features which means that it can be decomposed by microorganisms at low-cost [8–10]. In 1973, Pseudomonas O-3 strain, a bacterium isolated from soil was reported to be capable to take PVA as the sole source of carbon, in other words, they can decompose PVA. Experiments performed to elucidate the degradation mechanism explored an inducible enzyme Pseudomonas O-3 strain responsible to degrade PVA and assimilate the degraded PVA [11]. Since then, several bacterial strains that can degrade PVA have been reported, most of which belong to Pseudomonas. Besides the Pseudomonas enzyme, pyrroloquinoline quinone is also required as a coenzyme to complete the degradation process in some cases [12]. The main proposed mechanism of the degradation of PVA main-chain by bacteria is that a dehydrogenase or an oxidase oxidizes the neighboring hydroxyl groups and then a carbon-carbon bond cleaved reaction occurs with the participation of a hydrolase or an aldolase [13]. The oxidization process has two types: one enzyme involved and two enzymes involved. A study by Sakai et al. has reported that they isolated the secondary alcohol oxidase and the β-diketone hydrolase, and revealed that the oxidase utilizes molecular oxygen as an oxidant to form β-diketone in the PVA chain and then the bond between β-diketone is hydrolyzed by the β-diketone hydrolase [14]. The other type of PVA-degrading enzyme purified by Suzuki from Pseudomonas sp. O-3 can oxidize the hydroxyl group using oxygen and catalyze the bond between β-diketone [15]. Though the wild-type PVA-degrading enzymes have been isolated, purified and well-studied in the past, they are hardly applicable to the industrial scale, because of the low efficiency toward degrading PVA. Therefore, there is strong demand for modifying the enzymes to achieve better PVA degradation efficiency. The present works investigated the binding process between OPH and oxidized PVA using molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method, Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) method, molecular dynamics (MD). And focused on the cleavage mechanism of the carbon chain bond at the atomic level with QM/MM approach in order to provide molecular insights into the enzymatic reactivity and to assist improving the performance of the enzyme on degrading PVA. This can be of great value for the practical use of modified Pseudomonas hydrolyse for plastic waste treatment and recycle of PVA products. First, binding free energies between the ligand and Pseudomonas hydrolyse were studied by the MM-PBSA method and LIE method which has been demonstrated the ability to calculate the relatively binding free energy in previous studies [16–20]. Second, selected region included the reactant, crucial parts of Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad and the critical residues are treated with quantum mechanism and the rest of the system are treat with molecular mechanism in order to compute the energy changes for the reactions. The electrostatic effects of residues around the QM region are also investigated. The currently utilized method is more affordable to compute large biosystems than the all-quantum mechanism treatment and is more reliable than the molecular mechanism. The results provide new insights into the mechanism of PVA degradation by oxidized polyvinyl alcohol hydrolase as well as valuable guidance for future attempts to improve the enzyme performances."
1,Methods,
2,MD simulation,"2.1 MD simulation Acetylacetone (ACA), the dimer of oxidized polyvinyl alcohol were used in the present study as the ligand to investigate the interaction between the PVA and OPH due to its availability in the Protein Date Bank. The crystal structure (PDB code 3WL7, resolution 1.67 Å) of protein [21] and ligand simulated in the present study obtained by X-ray diffraction was download form the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). The missing residues 1–17 and 354–359 of OPH were omitted in the present work as they are all far away from the active site and the ligand, all simulations in the present work involved 3WL7 mutate the S172C to its natural-existing form. To estimate the binding free energy between OPH and ACA, we preform molecular mechanics combined with Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations for OPH-ACA, the native Pseudomonas oxidized PVA hydrolase (pOPH) (PDB 3WL6), the complex of a mutated pOPH (S127C) and the ligand, p-nitrophenyl caprylate (PNPC) which was replaced by ACA (PDB 3WL8) and four artificial mutation system obtained using Amber18 software package. Due to the lack of ligand position information for 3WL6 and 3WL8, the protein-ligand complex was obtained using of AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2), which has integrated a fast and accurate scoring function algorithm. Briefly, for each atom i , a type t i is assigned, then a symmetric set of interaction functions f t i t j of the interatomic distance r ij will be defined automatically, then under the optimization algorithm, attempts to find the global minimum of the conformation-dependent part of the scoring function: c = ∑ i < j f t i t j ( r ij ) The value of the function is the combination of the intermolecular and intramolecular section: c = c inter + c intra Finally, the binding free energy is calculated from the intermolecular part of the lowest-scoring conformation function: s i = g ( c inter ) The predicted docking results are output refer to the rank of calculated free energy [22]. For the docking process, both of the protein and ligand are first treatment by the AutoDockTools (version 1.5.6) [23] where the dock grid parameters are referred to the ligand position already known in 3WL7 and the grid box is approximately 30 × 30 × 30 Å3. The conformation with the lowest energy was selected as the initial binding fragment to carry out MD simulations. Ligand parameters were generated by antechamber17.3 using general amber force field (gaff) [24] during which the charge on every atom was calculated using the AM1-BCC method with the included sqm program [25]. The system was parameterized by LEaP using ff14SB in Amber18 suite [26]. TIP3P water model was used to modelling the solvent and 15.0 Å buffer region was added between the protein boundary and the regular octahedron periodical boundary. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) method were implemented to treat long range electrostatic interactions and a cut off of 8 Å was used to identify the nonbond interactions. The system size of each system are provided in the supporting information. The molecule dynamics was performed using pmemd.cuda module that uses GPU to accelerate simulation [27–29]. All systems were minimized through a 20,000 step with the steepest descent method to reach converged energy. Subsequently, they are quick heated using a 200 ps NVT langevin dynamics (collision frequency γ = 1.0). Which is followed by a 200 ps constant pressure (1.0 bar) equilibrating process to keep periodic box dimensions stable and system density fluctuating within 1.04 g/cm3. Finally 50 ns NPT MD was performed for all systems with a timestep of 2 fs under the SHAKE bond constraints with hydrogen involved, where trajectory files were written every 20 ps to ensure each of the conformations are sampled with statistical independence, as a consequence, there were 2500 frames in each trajectory. CHARMM molecular dynamics software was employed to perform the MD and generate stable structures and frames for QM/MM calculations. The topologies and parameters of the substrates in the CHARMM force field were generated from Swissparam (www.swissparam.ch) [30]. PROPKA version 3.1 was employed to determing the protonation states of all ionizable amino acid residues at the pH of 7.0 [31,32]. HBUILD module of the CHARMM molecular dynamics suite was used to add missing hydrogen atoms in the crystal structure according to the CHARMM22 force field [33–35]. The complexes were dissolved in a water droplet (TIP3P model) [36] and the radiuses were set to half the longest axis of the complex plus another 5 Å. Finally, the system constructed for the MD simulation was composed of 16,779 atoms. The neutralization step was skipped as the system is neutral. Prior to MD simulation, coarse energy minimizations were performed to relax the system. The system was first heated from absolute zero to 300.0 K within 50 ps (1 fs per step) and equilibrated thermally for 500 ps (1 fs per step) to reach the equilibration state. Subsequently another non-heating 50 ps dynamics simulation was performed. After that, a 20 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out at 298.15 K using the NVT ensemble to generate conformational samples for QM/MM calculations. During the MD simulations, a force of 3 kcal/mol/Å2 restrains was applied on substrate to keep consistence with its positions in the complex crystal structure. The leap-frog algorithm and Langevin temperature coupling method implemented in the CHARMM program was employed during the simulations [37]. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values during the MD period are provided in the supporting information."
3,Binding free energy calculations,"2.2 Binding free energy calculations To study the binding process of the pOPH and ACA, MM-PBSA method and Linear Interaction energy (LIE) method are carried out. MM-PBSA is one of the popular end point semiempirical method predict the binding free energy, in this method, Δ G bind is estimated from the free energies of the reactants and product of the reaction: Δ G bind = 〈 G PL 〉 - 〈 G P 〉 - 〈 G L 〉 where the subscript P stands for protein and L for ligand. The other popular method to estimate binding free energy is LIE method developed by Aqvist et al. LIE evaluated the averages of the interaction energies between the ligand and its surroundings environment from free and bound state based on evaluation of ligand interaction energetics. The binding free energy is calculated as Δ G bind = α 〈 E ele L - S 〉 PL - 〈 E ele L - S 〉 L + β 〈 E vdW L - S 〉 PL - 〈 E vdW L - S 〉 L where the superscripts L-S means the interaction between ligand and surroundings, subscripts ele and vdW denotes electrostatic and van der Waals interaction, respectively. Two empirical parameters α and β have been well studied. Both methods could lead to acceptable results, but the performance varies on systems as been demonstrated in other investigations. LIE method costs less computational resources than MM-PBSA owing to the entropy estimate, but due to the parameters, MM-PBSA are used more widely. Note that both methods is meant to calculated the relative binding free energy, thus the values should only compare with each other under the same method. In the present work, both two methods were used to study the binding process. MM-PBSA calculations were carried out using the MMPBSA.py.MPI in AmberTools18 [38]. Every 50 frame of the trajectory was sampled (50frames) and all other setup was set as the default values. Single trajectory protocol was employed to perform the MD simulation for MM-PBSA instead of the multiple trajectory protocol as the ligand is small (totally 15 atoms). According to an experimental report, configurational space explored by the receptor and ligand is relatively stable between the bound and unbound states [21]. LIE method were performed used CPPTRAJ version 18.01 for all the frames in all trajectories [39]. According to the previous reported, two parameters α and β are set to 0.18 and 0.5, respectively."
4,QM/MM calculations,"2.3 QM/MM calculations The ChemShell3.6.0 [40–42] platform which integrates the programs Turbomole7.2 [43] and DL-POLY [44] was used to perform QM/MM calculations [41], DFT method was applied to treat the atoms in the QM-region [43], and the CHARMM22 force field was used to compute the energy of MM-region. In the QM/MM calculations, hydrogen atoms served as link atoms were added on the bond axis by the ChemShell hybrid module and the link atom positions were determined according to the QM and MM atom positions automatically. Charge shift model [45] and electrostatic embedding method [46] were implemented in the calculations. Briefly, the electrostatic coupling were handled by including the MM atoms as point charges in the QM code, a charge shift correction were applied, in which charge present on the first layer of MM atoms (those direct connected to the QM region) is moved to the second layer (those direct connected to the first layer atoms). A dipole (consist of two point charges) was placed on the recipient atom in order to conserve the charge and dipole of the MM system. Fifteen frames were extracted from the 20 ns CHARMM MD simulation as the QM/MM study samples, those frames are selected because of the distance between the triad and ligand were less than 2.5 Å, which most probably would lead to catalytically relevant barriers. Each structure obtain from the 15 frames are used to perform QM/MM investigation to simulation the energy barriers. Potential energy surface scans were carried out by restraint the reaction coordinates, defined as the difference between the OG and O4 bond length in the first step and the C3 and C4 in the second step, and optimizing the geometries at each step using the hybrid delocalized internal coordinates optimizer (HDLC Optimiser) at the M06-2X/6-31G//CHARMM22 level. The HDLC Optimiser was employed to optimize the geometries of the intermediates and to search the transition states at the M06-2X/6-31G*//CHARMM22 level, 6-311++G** was used for computing the single point energy [47,48]. Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BGFS) algorithm in HDLC was used to determine the geometries of the intermediate products. Partitioned-Rational Function Optimization (P-RFO) method was employed to search transition state. The QM region consists of residues Ser172, Asp253, His298, Ser173, Ser66, Val67 and ACA. Overall resulted in a 70 QM atoms system (important atom are labelled in Fig. 1 ), atoms within 15 Å of the liang were set as the QM/MM region which were allowed to move and the outside MM atoms were fixed during the QM/MM calculations."
5,Boltzmann-weighted average,"2.4 Boltzmann-weighted average The reaction pathway modelled in the present work is often called restrain coordinate driving (RCD) methods which means the reaction is retrained to occur by forcing to a predefined chemically relevant reaction coordinate [49]. Compared with other QM/MM reaction pathway determing method like elf-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) or Nudged Elastic Band (NEB), the method cost less computational resources in spite of the drawback [50–52]. The final energy barrier is the integrated results based on considering all the fluctuant frames of a single enzyme molecule. Assuming that each frame obtained from the MD trajectory corresponds to a local special reaction pathway, previous QM/MM investigations have demonstrated that RCD method combined with Boltzmann-weighted averaging method could lead to experimental turnover number ( k c a t ) [53]. Boltzmann-weighted averaging method [54–56] was computed among the fifteen frames: Δ E = - R T ln 1 n ∑ i = 1 n e x p - Δ E i RT where Δ E is the average energy barrier, R is gas constant, n is the number of frames, Δ E i is the energy barrier of path i, and T is the temperature. If not specially noted, the “average barrier” mentioned in the following paragraphs refers to Boltzmann-weighted averaging barrier."
6,Results and discussion,
7,MM-PBSA and LIE,"3.1 MM-PBSA and LIE Binding is typically considered to be the first step in enzymatic catalysis. In Table 1 , we show the binding free energy ΔG bind obtained from the MM-PBSA and LIE calculations and the four residues having the highest energy contributions as indicated from energy decomposition calculations. As shown in Table 1, the ligand-protein binding free energies predicted by the MM-PBSA and LIE are dissimilar. Due to the usage of different method, the trends of the binding free energy changes after mutations are more relevant instead of the free energy values. The trends predicted by two method after are mostly in agreement with each other. According to experiment, mutating Ser172 of oxidized polyvinyl alcohol hydrolase (OPH) to Ala yields lower ligand-protein affinity, however, it remains unknown whether reaction can occur without the Ser residue of catalytic triad. The OPH Ser172Ala mutation can be considered not as important as others for improving the catalytic efficiency because Ser172 acts as a component of the catalytic triad, and previous study has shown the S172A mutation would result in nearly half of the catalysis rate [21]. The wild type lead to a higher energy difference which means the binding maybe relatively reliable in the real complex thus the 3WL7 is considered as an excellent system to carry out our next part investigation. Based on the calculations for the four artificial mutations (Ser66Ala, Val67Ala, Trp255Ala and Try270Ala), only mutating Ser66 to Ala results in a higher energy, which implies that Ser66 has significant contribution to the binding. On the other hand, the lower binding free energies obtained for the rest three artificially generated system indicate that the corresponding mutations may impede the binding process. Particularly, residue Val67 may significantly impede the protein-ligand binding and the subsequent catalysis reaction due to the lacking of ligand binding pocket. The system involving Tyr270Ala OPH also processes a lower energy in comparison with the wide-type OPH, possibly because that the large Tyr270 R group creates significant spatial barrier for the reactant to contact with OPH. In contrast mutating OPH Trp255 to Ala results in negligible binding free energy difference, suggesting that the Trp255 plays a neutral role in the OPH-ACA binding process. Energy decomposition calculation elucidated that Glu126 and Trp121 play significant binding roles in the OPH-ACA binding in most of the systems, the distance between ACA and two residues are less than 10 Å(distance between ACA and the four residues are provided in the Supportary Materials). Thus the van der Waals force and electrostatic influence play the main role, with solvation effects contribute to a small proportion. This is likely due to the large R group that has significant van der Waals influences rather than electrostatic and polar solvation effects brought by the two residues. The residue Asn120 also has a great contribution, however, lacks the large R group in comparison with Glu126 and Trp121. The S172A mutation carried out experimentally would cause the Michaelis constant (KM ) increases, which means the Ser172 can promote binding [21]. Thus the nearby residues especially the ones playing negative roles can be candidates for medications aiming at enhancing the OPH-ACA binding. The energy decomposition analysis of the ACA reveals that the three main forces are all relatively high in all system and both van der Waals and electrostatic force shows the ability to promote binding process. The van der Waals force remain relatively stable in all systems and is the strongest in the system involving the Tyr270Ala OPH. The electrostatic effect shows large variation among different systems and is the weakest in the Ser66Ala OPH participating system. Based on the binding free energy, electrostatic effects could be the main factor impacting the OPH-ACA affinity the van der Waals has little variation in different systems."
8,Reaction mechanism and structural details,"3.2 Reaction mechanism and structural details QM/MM calculations were conducted to delineate the detailed reaction mechanism that was proposed in previous studies [6,13,14]. Key bonds lengths changes of the reaction are analyzed in order to determine the structural changes in the OPH-ACA reacting process (Table 2 ) where the focus is put on the lowest energy pathway during the C-C bond break process as a majority of the catalytic reactions proceed through pathways with the lowest energy barriers (see Fig. 2 ). The OPH-ACA complex was selected as the investigation system because the crystal structure of the whole complex is available. In our MD simulation, RMSD is steady and the results are consistent with the structure determined by experiments, and the substrate moved a little from its initial position but still stay quite near to the catalytic triad 3.20 Å as shown in one of the frames. In the optimized reactant state, the length of the oxygen atom of the OPH Ser172 and the C4 of ACA decreased to 2.55 Å. In addition, the torsion angle (C2C3C4C5) of ACA change slightly from 150.47 to 159.30, leading C4 became even near to the Ser172 and promoting the degradation reaction. Followed by a transition state, an intermediate is generated which has a bond length of 1.52 Å between C4-OG. In this first reaction step, the C3C4 bond length of ACA remains relatively constant, however, the hydrogen bond formed between the OH group of OPH Ser66 and the ACA O4 changes slightly, indicating that the Ser66 play a critical role in this step through the hydrogen-bonding interaction. The O4 of ACA and the OH group of the OPH Ser66 acted as an electron receptor (ER), whereas the OH in Ser66 acts as an electron donor (ED), respectively. As the reaction proceeds, electrostatic attraction force between the ER and ED make the attraction between C4 and O4 of ACA weaker, and the OG of Ser172 formed a bond with C4 of ACA and consequently lead to the formation of the IM1. The second step involves the breaking of bond between C3 and C4 of ACA, of which the length increases to 2.96 Å from 1.55 Å as the participation of N atoms of residues Ser66 and Val67 results in the formation of a transition state. The high strength of the bond between C4 and O4 leads to C3 moving away from C4 and the formation of an enol like state, IM2. Subsequently a neighboring water reacts with the unstable IM2 and contributes a proton to generate an acetone molecule with C3. The hydroxyl group from water molecule will bind to the C3 atom resulting in the breaking of the bond between OG from Ser172 and C3, Subsequently, Hsd298 of the catalytic triad returns the proton to Ser172 and the enzyme gets back to the initial state. After this, the enzyme enters to the next reaction loop of which the mechanism is beyond the scope of this study. In summary, the H-bonds formed between the ACA and Gly65, Ser66, Val67 of the OPH are considered as the key factor contributing to the breaking of ACA C3C4 bond as the hydrogen-bond network stabilize the corresponding electrons of the ACA. The chain break mechanism is briefly illustrated in Fig. 3 . Overall the hydrogen bond network formed between ACA and OPH is critical to the reaction, among which the hydrogen bonds, OG-O4, Val67-O2, HN-O4 play key roles. Herein, the corresponding bond lengths are analyzed as they can indirectly reflect the hydrogen bond energies. The relationships between the bond lengths and the energy barrier are depicted for the OG-O4, Val67-O2, HN-O4 bonds in Fig. 4a . For the OG-O4, these frames with lower energies are mostly located in the area with shorter bond lengths. In the case of Ser66-O4, almost all frames have a bond length around 1.83 Å. Shorter Val67-O2 bond length can lead to lower energy barrier, so indicating the hydrogen bond is of considerable value to the reaction state. Overall the energy barrier are all located near the shorter bond length area, illustrating the strong correlation between the hydrogen bond length and the energy barrier. The results indicate that, future mutation studies can focus on modifying the hydrogen network between ACA and OPH to promote the catalysis reaction."
9,Energy profiles,"3.3 Energy profiles All 15 frames obtained from the MD simulation [57] with energy profile are shown in Fig. 4b . The majority of them shows similar energy change with an acceptable RMSD for the QM region (Fig. 4c ), Boltzmann-weighted average energy [58–60] differences between each state from the QM/MM simulation are calculated in order to avoid the deviation caused by the chosen frame and the results are depicted in Fig. 4d . The degradation of acetylacetone involves two elementary steps. In the first step the bond length between OPH Ser172 and ACA C4 decreases and the system overcomes a lower energy barrier of 9.0 kcal/mol and to form the first intermediate (IM1). After that, another 13.1 kcal is required to reach the second transition state, which is relatively high and makes the rate-determining step. Next the IM2 forms with a small energy change, which is followed by a proton transfer reaction associated with a huge energy gap to end the catalysis. The whole reaction procedure is exothermic and release 7.33 kcal/mol."
10,Residue electrostatic influence,"3.4 Residue electrostatic influence Twenty residues around the QM region, were chosen to calculate their electrostatic influence on the QM C3-C4 bond cleavage reaction. The energy change caused by the amino acid mutation can be calculated as follows: Δ E i - 0 = Δ E i - Δ E 0 where Δ E i - 0 is the difference between the charged and non-charged barrier, Δ E i is the energy barrier with charges on the R group of residue i set to 0, Δ E 0 is the energy barrier as a result of the original values. In order to analyzing the QM region, the residue chosen should in principle be outside the QM region. The geometry structures of the stationary points were kept unchanged in the calculation. A positive value of Δ E i - 0 stands for that neglecting the effect of R group of the i th residue will increase the energy barrier, while a negative one means the R group exert a negative influence on the catalytic reaction, namely the i th residue would impede the reaction. The electrostatic influences of the twenty residues on the ACA C3-C4 bond breaking processes are schematically represented in Fig. 5 . Asn112, Thp121, Glu198, Thr258, Arg264, Tyr270 have important contributions to the reaction ( Δ E i - 0 > 2.0 kcal mol−1), among which the residue Glu198 exert an extremely positive influence ( Δ E i - 0 = 13.89 kcal mol−1) and may act as a stimulus in the reaction. Among these, the result of Tyr270 has a consensus with the rare experimental data, which can prove our method is acceptable [21]. The significant influence of the Glu198 is a result of the −1 charge on the R group of Glu198, without the electrostatic influence of the R group the electrons between the C3-C4 bond is unlikely to move to the C3 and formed a acetone (position of Glu198 is provided the supporting information). On the contrary, Thr258 shows a negative influence ( Δ E i - 0 = −4.97 kcal mol−1) on the reaction, and relatively small contribution to the QM region. Other residues outside the QM region are considered to have relatively weaker electrostatic influence on the ACA C3-C4 cleavage."
11,Conclusion,"The present work carried out MD and QM/MM simulations to elucidate the binding contributions of several residues of OPH to the degradation of ACA. In the binding state, Glu121 and Trp121 facilitate the ACA contacting with OPH to prepare for the reaction. In the reaction state, Gly65, Ser66, Val67 form hydrogen network, which enhance the enzymatic efficiency. Bond cleavage between C3-C4 atoms of ACA is demonstrated to be the rate-determining step. To modify the OPH, residue Glu198 should be avoided due to its critical electrostatic influence. Future investigation on how to improve the enzymatic degradation of PVA or analogous polymers should focus on the modification of the residues of OPH that have less contributions to the catalysis reaction as revealed in the current study, especially the ones do not exert important effects in the electrostatic influence section."
