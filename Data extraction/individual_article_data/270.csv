0,Introduction,"One of the major challenges facing the world today is building a sustainable society for future generations [1]. Considering the continued decline in primary fossil fuels and concern for the environmental security, much attention is paid to the production of renewable fuels from a wide variety of resources, such as lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. wheat straw) and wastes such as animal wastes, sewage sludge (SS) and food waste. The biomass can be converted to biocrude by thermochemical processes, with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis being two most prominent. Out of these two processes, HTL is an attractive option, since either wet or dry waste feedstock can be used in the hydrothermal medium. The use of high-moisture biomass omits an energy-intensive drying process, which has been found to save about 50% of the total energy requirements [2]. As all biomass typically contains at least 50% moisture [3], and a pumpable slurry has to be created in order to carry out HTL processing, feedstock slurries typically contain 80–90% water [4]. Therefore, a vast amount of wastewater are generated, termed HTL-aqueous phase (HTL-AP). Its discharge into the environment without sufficient treatment leads to the environmental and health impacts due to the presence of toxic substances and also high levels of ammonium which could cause nutrient runoff and eutrophication. Moreover, it is also reported that during the HTL of woody biomass about 40% of the carbon partitions into the aqueous phase, reducing the carbon efficiency of the process and its disposal cost is estimated to be around 22% of the fuel production cost [5]. Considering this, and as stated in the review of Watson and et al. (2020) [6], it is highly relevant to determine the most suitable method to unleash the energy present within HTL-AP to maximize the upscale potential of the HTL process. Currently catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG) and anaerobic digestion (AD) are the two most referenced processes envisioned to tackle the HTL-AP processing issue [7]. In the CHG process the organic compounds dissolved in the HTL-AP can be transformed to gas consisting of CH4 and CO2 [8]. However, the capital cost to treat the HTL-AP by CHG is significant and the precious metal catalysts used are susceptible to sulfur poisoning [9]. In comparison, AD is a cost-effective method for HTL-AP treatment with energy recovery in the form of biogas (a mixture of CH4 and CO2) [10]. However, the HTL-AP can be toxic to anaerobes due to its high concentrations of ammonia or phenolic compounds, which inhibit the function of microorganisms and biogas production [11,12]. Hence, in some cases the AD cannot be applicable to the HTL-AP unless the high content of recalcitrant compounds in HTL-AP is diluted heavily or pre-treated [12,13,15,16]. Other strategies to valorize HTL-AP, such as aqueous phase reforming to produce hydrogen [17] and catalytic upgrading of aqueous streams rich in carboxylic acids into valuable olefins and alcohols via ketonization [2,18], have also been reported. However, deactivation of catalysts makes these valorization routes challenging. Alternatively, the group of A. Montoya (2020) reported for the first time an electrochemical oxidation (EO) process to reduce the quantity of soluble organic compounds in the wastewater produced from the HTL of microalgae (Chlorella sp.) [19] . The HTL-AP with a COD of 36,000 mg/L and organic nitrogen of 3000 mg/L was EO treated over a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode. A COD removal efficiency of 99% was achieved, including the decomposition of organic nitrogen to ammonium. Similarly, Juan A. Lopez-Ruiz et al. (2020) [20] recently performed the electrocatalytic oxidation of an aqueous phase produced from HTL of sludge. The process removed around 23% of nitrogen and 39% of carbon and 48% of COD at the applied potential of 4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. They also calculated the theoretical hydrogen production rate by assuming that all the electrons generated at the anode form hydrogen at the cathode. According to the calculations, the EO treatment of wastewater can generate enough hydrogen for hydrotreating biocrude. In general, the EO processes have their advantages due to their robustness and simplicity in operation [21]. Most importantly, the EO techniques can remove a relatively wide range of refractory organic and inorganic compounds. However, the EO method has long been criticized for its high energy consumption [22]. In this context, one way to offset the cost of EO- HTL-AP is to integrate energy recovery in the form of H2 from cathodic reactions working with parallel advanced anodic oxidation, making the electrochemical HTL-AP purification approach more economical and sustainable. The most promising and widely studied electrode for EO processes is the BDD electrode, since it possesses a large potential window, remarkable corrosion resistance and high chemical stability [23,24]. During electrochemical oxidation BDD anode generates weakly adsorbed hydroxyl radicals, which unselectively and completely oxidize organic substances [27]. Besides this, due to its wide potential window, it is also possible to produce valuable hydrogen [28] that can be integrated into the upgrading of HTL biocrudes to generate transport fuels. The properties and operating conditions play a significant role in the EO-HTL-AP, as they have a definite effect on the rate and efficiency of the EO process due to the different oxidability of the organic compounds contained in the process water [32]. Therefore, in the present study two different types of HTL-AP produced from the HTL process of wheat straw and sewage sludge were treated by EO over bipolar BDD electrodes by varying the energy densities. Two representative HTL-AP samples of wheat straw and sewage sludge were chosen to represent a range from low nitrogen (N) to high N content (409–1692 mg/L). For the first time we present data on simultaneous hydrogen production and COD reduction as a function of time and current density. The work further evaluates the overall implication of energy efficiency of an integrated HTL-EO process as well as the theoretical hydrogen availability for on-site bio-crude upgrading."
1,Materials and methods,
2,HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS characterization,"2.1 HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS characterization Hydrothermal liquefaction of the wheat straw and sewage sludge was performed on the continuous HTL pilot plant at Aarhus University (Denmark) and has been described elsewhere in detail [4,33]. The process operating parameters for HTL of wheat straw and sewage sludge are given in Table 1 . The HTL stream products were collected in a separation funnel and the HTL-AP by-products were then separated gravimetrically."
3,Electrochemical oxidation set-up,"2.2 Electrochemical oxidation set-up Electrochemical oxidation of HTL-AP was performed using proaqua-Testsystem-1 (pro aqua Diamantelektroden Produktion GmbH, Germany). The proaqua-Testsystem-1 is installed on a plastic sheet and consists of the proaqua-test-cell-1 and a control device with integrated pole reverser. Continuous reversal protects the built-in boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDD) and contact plates from sedimentation. When the reversal time has expired the system makes a pause and the poles are automatically reversed and the system starts again with the set reversal time. During electrolysis BDD produces weakly adsorbed hydroxyl radicals that non-selectively and completely mineralize organic contaminants: (1) BDD + H2O = BDD(•OH) + H+ + e- (2) BDD(•OH) + R = BDD + CO2 + H2O The current was supplied in a square pulse wave with the 50% of duty cycle. A pulse cycle T is composed of Ton (turn-on period) and Toff (turn-off period) [34]. During the Ton the steady current was delivered for 15 min, while at the Toff the current supply is stopped. Three boron-doped diamond electrodes are built into a flow-through cell. The distance between the electrodes is 2 mm, whereas the total electrode area of three electrodes is 126 cm2 (42 cm2 each electrode). The constant current was supplied with a BK-Precision 9103 power source (0–64 V, 0–10A). The experiments were performed in recirculating mode with a flow rate of 90 ml/min. The effluents of the HTL-AP were delivered by a peristaltic pump from a 2L reservoir borosilicate glass containing 500 ml of HTL-AP. The flask was mixed continuously at 400 rpm using a magnetic stirrer. Warming of the liquid during the experiments was observed mainly at higher current densities. At 1 A∙h intervals 2 ml samples were withdrawn and gas products were collected into 10 ml vials by flushing the vials for 5 min. The flow rate of the gases is monitored by a flow meter (BPC® µFlow, BPC Instruments AB, Sweden). The electrode voltage and current were noted each time from the power supply display. After each experiment, the proaqua-Testsystem-1 was cleaned with diluted citric acid solution followed by deionized water."
4,Characterization of water samples and gas analysis,"2.3 Characterization of water samples and gas analysis HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS before and after the EO treatment were analyzed for COD and NH4 + content using Merck Spectroquant cuvette tests (COD-114541 and NH4 +-114559). The total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) analyses were performed using a scalar FORMACS HT-I TOC/TN analyzer to account for the total organic carbon and total nitrogen present in the course of the EO of the HTL-AP samples. The pH and conductivity of the HTL-AP samples were measured with a portable meter (the Knick Portavo 907). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was employed for the identification of the main components of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS before and after the EO treatment. Prior to GC–MS analysis, the samples were derivatized with methyl chloroformate (MCF). The derivitization procedure was adapted from the studies [3,33]. Briefly, about 200 μL of the HTL-AP samples were mixed with 40 μL NaOH (5%) and 40 μL pyridine, then methyl chloroformate was added in two portions (2x20 μL) as a derivitization agent. The nonpolar compounds were then separated by addition of 400 μL chloroform containing an internal standard (4-bromotoluene, 20 µg/L). Additionally, about 400 μL NaHCO3 (50 mM) were added to the solutions in order to improve phase separation. The organic phase after extraction was analyzed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5977A quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC inlet was held at 280 °C with a split ratio of 20:1 and 1 μL was injected. A VF-5 ms column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used. The column oven was programmed to start at 60 °C, hold for 2 min, ramp at 5 °C/min to 200 °C, ramp at 20 °C/min to 320 °C and a final hold time of 5 min. The mass spectrometer transfer line and ion source were held at 300 °C. Electron impact ionization was employed at 70 eV and data acquisition was performed in scan mode (35–400 m/z). The data analysis was performed using Agilent Masshunter Quantitative analysis software. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) were quantitatively determined by gas chromatography (System 7890A, Agilent Technologies, USA) with a flame ionization detector GC-FID using a HP-INNOWAX column (30 m,0.25 µm, 0.25 ID) with helium and hydrogen as carrier gases. Gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) was employed for the determination of the gas composition. After an injection, the gas sample was divided into two flows and analyzed simultaneously within two detection routes: 1) H2 and 2) N2, CO2, CH4. Hydrogen was determined using a ShinCarbon ST Packed Column (Restek, USA) with argon as carrier gas, while N2, CO2 and CH4 were determined using a Porapak Q column (Agilent Technologies, USA) with helium as carrier gas. The quantification of H2 and CO2 was performed by GC-TCD (Agilent Technologies 7890A, USA) with a Porapak Q column (Agilent) and using nitrogen as carrier gas. The gas standards were prepared by mixing H2, CO2 and N2 with different concentration using Brook SLA 5800 mass flow controllers. The Brook SLA 5800 mass controllers were monitored by Brooks expert Support Tool (BEST) software. In this study gas flow rates are presented at 273 K and 1 atm."
5,Analysis and calculation,"2.4 Analysis and calculation The COD and TOC removal was calculated by (3) CODremoval (%)=(CODinitial -CODend)/CODinitial ∙100 (4) TOCremoval (%)=(TOCinitial -TOCend)/ TOCinitial ∙100 The general current efficiency (GCECOD) for the EO was calculated using the COD values (in g∙L-1), using the following formula (5) GCE COD = COD initial - COD end F V 8 I t ∙ 100 % where F is the Faraday constant and V is the solution volume (L), I is the applied current (A) and t is the electrolysis time (s). The GCECOD was divided to 3 due to three electrodes in the proaqua-Testsystem-1. The general current efficiency (GCEH2) for the hydrogen production was calculated by (6) GCE H 2 = FVnG MIt where n is the number of electrons, G is the flow rate (g/L) of H2, M is the molecular weight of H2 (g/mol), I is the applied current (A) and t is the electrolysis time (s). The GCEH2 was divided to 3 due to three electrodes in the proaqua-Testsystem-1. The energy recovered by the hydrogen production was calculated by the following formula: (7) E H 2 = γ V H 2 In which γ (0.0033 kW∙L-1) is specific energy for H2 gas and VH2 (L) is the volume of the hydrogen produced. The energy consumption was calculated: (8) EC = U I t where U is the applied voltage (V), I is the applied current (A) and t is the electrolysis time (h). The energy efficiency and EROI for HTL of wheat straw and sewage sludge were determined previously [4,33] considering the electrical energy consumed by the main units of the HTL pilot plant, such as trim heater, reactor and feed pump: (9) EROI HTL = Q bio - c r u d e ( k W ) EC HTL ( k W ) In order to estimate the energy efficiency of an integrated HTL-EO process the EROI calculations have been performed also considering the electrical energy of the EO unit as the energy output and the hydrogen produced as energy input: (10) EROI HTL - E O = Q bio - c r u d e ( k W ) + Q H 2 ( k W ) EC HTL ( k W ) + EC EO ( k W ) The EC for EO system was estimated from the experimental results of the present study and scaled up proportionally considering the volume of the HTL-AP produced from the HTL pilot plant: (11) EC 2 = EC 1 V 1 ∙ V 2 where EC1 is the electrical energy consumed for the V1 volume of the HTL-AP, V1 is the volume of the HTL-AP (0.5 L) employed in the present study, V2 is the total volume of the HTL-AP obtained from the continuous HTL pilot plant. Similarly, the theoretical hydrogen availability for on-site bio-crude upgrading is also defined by assuming that the formation of H2 is the consequence reaction of the oxidation of the organics of the HTL-AP: (12) V H 2 2 = V ( H 2 ) 1 V 1 ∙ V 2 where V(H2)1 is the volume of the hydrogen produced per V1 volume of the HTL-AP. The theoretical hydrogen availability was compared to the theoretical amount of hydrogen required to fully hydrogenate the bio-crude containing oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms, not taking into account any additional hydrogen for hydrogenation of double bonds or similar."
6,Results and discussion,
7,COD and TOC removal rates,"3.1 COD and TOC removal rates The physicochemical characteristics of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS are shown in Table 2 . As can be seen, the effluents are characterized by a significant content of COD (57108 and 35762 mg/L) and TN (429.9 and 1692.8 mg/L) for the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively. Also, both HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS present good conductivity, owing to the high concentration of different ions, which allows to conduct the EO process without increasing the electrolyte concentration by adding mineral salts. The pH of both effluents are acidic due to the presence of organic acids. The efficiency of EO of HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS was evaluated by supplying the current density in the range of 45.7–142.9 mA∙cm−2. In an attempt to qualitatively eludicate the electro-degredation pathway of the contaminants of the HTL-AP a wide variety of information is presented such as COD, TOC, TN and N-NH4 +/NH3 concentrations. Fig. 1 depicts the influence of the current density and electrolysis time on the COD and TOC removal percentages during the EO-HTL-AP. Generally, for both effluents the COD and TOC reduction increased with increasing applied current density and electrolysis time. This is due to the fact that higher charge input generates higher amount of oxidants. From the literature electro-oxidation of pollutants are known to proceed by direct and indirect oxidation mechanisms. At high current densities the mineralisation of organics is enhanced indirectly through the formation of strong oxidizers from heterogeneous species contained in the wastewater [35–37]. The EO of the HTL-AP-WS resulted in lower COD and TOC removal percentages than those of the EO-HTL-AP-SS, which can be explained by its higher initial concentrations of the COD and TOC [38]. For instance, the COD removal rates of HTL-AP-SS at 45.7 and 95.2 mA∙cm−2 were almost twice as efficient in comparison to that of HTL-AP-WS. At 142.9 mA∙cm−2 after 5A∙h of electrolysis the COD concentration was only 113 mg/L, thus reaching the European discharge limit values for COD (COD 125 mg/L, TN 15 mg/L) [39]. In the case of the EO of HTL-AP-WS, the COD decreased from 57,108 to 10,518 mg/L at 142.9 mA∙cm−2 after 5A∙h, thereby not complying with the discharge requirements. It can also be ascertained from Fig. 1 that the removal rates of TOC follow a similar trend to the COD values of the HTL-AP-SS for all current densities. The TOC removal rate of around 99% was observed at the current densities of 95.4 and 142.9 mA∙cm−2 after 5 h of electrolysis time. In the case of the HTL-AP-WS, the removal rates TOC were lower compared to the COD removal percentages. This could indicate that HTL-AP-WS also contains more persistent and less oxidizable organic pollutants [40,41]. The TOC removal efficiency was enhanced from 18 to 73% with an increase in the current density from 45.7 to 142.9 mA∙cm−2. The TN removal was relatively low at the current densities of 45.7 and 95.2 mA∙cm−2, while the maximum TN removal rates of about 21.7 and 39.8% were attained at 142.9 mA∙cm−2 after 5 A∙h of electrolysis time for the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively (Fig. 2 a and b). As seen in Fig. 2c, the average N-NH4 +/NH3 concentration of the HTL-AP-WS slightly decreased within 1 A∙h at 45.7 mA∙cm−2, fluctuating between 86.6 and 92.5 mg/L thereafter. In contrast, at 95.2 and 142.9 mA∙cm−2 the N-NH4 +/NH3 content decreased significantly after 2 and 1 A∙h, respectively, due to the stronger oxidative environment that promotes the oxidation of ammonia to nitrates and N2 gas. Ammonia is known to oxidize preferably at basic pH [42,43], while at neutral or acidic environment remains unaffected [44]. As seen from Table S1 in the Supporting information, the pH of the solution was basic only after electrolysis at 142.9 mA∙cm−2, so the decrease in the TN content after 5A∙h suggests that oxidation of ammonia took place to form N2. Concentrations of TN and N-NH4 +/NH3 of the HTL-AP-SS were 3.9 and 3.8 times higher than those in the HTL-AP-WS, accordingly their behaviour was different. From Fig. 2d, a gradual increase in the NH4 +/NH3 content was observed for all current densities because of the continuous electro-degradation of the nitrogen containing components. By the end of treatment, TN was mainly in the form of N-NH4 +/NH3 in the HTL-AP-SS at 142.9 mA∙cm−2. The fluctuation in the NH4 +/NH3 during the EO treatment can be due to the inequality of reduction and oxidation rates of the inorganic nitrogen species. Several competitive reactions can occurre simultaneously at the anodes and cathodes. In fact, NH4 +/NH3 can be formed by reduction of nitrates and also by oxidation of nitrogen containing aromatic compounds on BDD bipolar electrodes [45,46]. The reduction of the TN concentration at 142.9 mA∙cm−2 suggests that the oxidation was the predominant reaction removing the nitrogen as N2."
8,Current efficiencies for COD reduction and hydrogen production,"3.2 Current efficiencies for COD reduction and hydrogen production One possibility for energy recovery from the EO-HTL-AP is producing hydrogen gas [47]. Therefore, in order to evaluate the potential of the EO-HTL-AP to generate hydrogen, the hydrogen production rates were simultaneously measured during the EO of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS as shown in Table 3 . Based on the hydrogen production rates and COD removal rates, the general current efficiencies for the hydrogen production (GCEH2) and electrochemical oxidation (GCECOD) were determined and depicted in Fig. 3 . Several studies have already demonstrated that the oxidation of biomass is an excellent alternative to the less valuable OER (oxygen evolution reaction), and using biomass-derived substances instead of water with the aim of functioning as proton and electon donors in the EO process considerably reduces the processing costs [48]. In order to confirm this, we compared the hydrogen production rates for water oxidation and HTL-AP oxidation by supplying constant voltage. As expected, the current generation was negligible for water oxidation, while the presence of high contents of organic and inorganic substances in the HTL-AP allows to perform the electrolysis at a much lower potential. Then, NaCl was added to water to ensure the conductivity to be 24 and 7 mS/cm, corresponding to the initial conductivities of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively. In this case the hydrogen production rates were only 0.6 and 1.4 L/h at 47.6 mA∙cm−2 at 45.7 mA∙cm−2 for the conductivities of 24 and 7 mS/cm, respectively. At 147.2 mA∙cm−2 the hydrogen production rate reached 2.4 L/h for both conductivities. Based on these results, one can conclude that at 47.6 mA∙cm−2 around 43 and 22% of H2 is produced due the contribution of alternative electrons from the oxidation of organics of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively. In contrast, at highest current density the hydrogen is generated mainly from the water, since the hydrogen production rates of the EO of HTL-AP-SS and HTL-WS were lower by 20 and 15% than those of water oxidation with the conductivities 24 and 7 mS/cm, respectively. Correspondingly the general current efficiencies for the hydrogen production (GCEH2) and electrochemical oxidation (GCECOD) decreased with an increase in current density, as can be seen from Fig. 3. This can be associated with the commencement of side reactions, including oxidation of nitrogen, and/or the decreased concentration of organics that cause diffusion limitation. For instance, the oxidation of ammonia to form one mol nitrate and one mol N2 requires the 8- and 6- electron transfer [49–51], which consumes a greater fraction of the current input. The decrease in both GCEH2 and GCECOD were more prominent in the case of HTL-AP-SS due to its higher TN content. It is also interesting to note that CECOD was over 100% for HTL-AP-SS at 45.7 mA∙cm−2 due to the occurrence of the mediated oxidation mechanism by different inorganic species present in HTL-AP."
9,Energy consumption,"3.3 Energy consumption If the technical feasibility of the EO process is estimated in the context of the COD removal efficiency, the commercial viability is defined by the electric energy consumed [52]. Therefore, the energy consumption (EC) at different current densities and the energy recovered through the production of the hydrogen is demonstrated in Fig. 4 . The data in Fig. 4 shows that higher current densities require higher electric power consumption; however, the COD removal rates are slower with the lower current densities applied. About 7.5 and 13% of the electrical energy consumed can be recovered by the hydrogen gas production during the EO of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP- SS, respectively, at the current density of 45.7 mA∙cm2. As current density increases to 147.2 mA∙cm−2, the energy recovered by hydrogen production EH2 decreases to 3.9 and 3.6% for HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP- SS, respectively, since the hydrogen production rates did not increase significantly with the increment of the current density. From Fig. 4 it can be concluded that the EO-HTL-AP-SS is favorable at lower current density in terms of EC, hydrogen production and the COD removal rates. For instance, similar COD removal efficiency of about 57% can be achieved at the current densities of 45.7 and 147.2 mA∙cm2 after 5 h and 2 h, respectively. However, applying higher energy density resulted in higher electric power consumption (0.33 and and 0.56 kWh) and lower EH2 (0.01 and 0.03 kWh) for the current densities of 45.7 and 147.2 mA∙cm−2, respectively. With similar EC of 0.6 kWh higher COD removal rate of 78% can be achieved at 95.2 mA∙cm−2 after 3 h of electrolysis time and about 0.026 kWh energy can be compensated by the hydrogen formed. In the case of the HTL-AP-WS, applying lower current density is favorable in terms of the EC; however, it leads to significantly lower COD removal rates and hydrogen production rates. For instance, the employment of the current density of 45.7 consumed only 0.234 kWh, but resulted in the lowest EH2 and the lowest COD removal rate of 18%. The similar COD removal rate of 47% with the similar EC of 0.5 and 0.55 kWh was obtained for the current densities of 95.2 and 147.2 mA∙cm−2 after 5 and 3 h, respectively. However, higher EH2 is obtained at the current density of 95.2 than those obtained at 147.2 mA∙cm−2 (0.032 kWh vs. 0.02 kWh). According to the results obtained, one could assume that the optimum reaction conditions, in particular the current density and electrolysis time, can be adjusted depending on the concentration of the pollutants and their resistance to the electro-oxidation and the final applicability and priority of the reaction products (pollutants free water for direct discharge and/or hydrogen for the subsequent partial /full upgrading of the biocrude) or minimal energy consumption. For comparative purposes, Table S2 in the supplementary information, depicts the presented data in different units and the energy consumption and production as a function of g COD removed. For example; the experimental data point of the HTL-AP-SS at 45.7 mA∙cm−2 and 5 h of operation produced 0.03 kWh worth of H2 and removed 56.5% COD. This can be recalculated to 1.5 kWh H2 /kgCOD removed, the highest achieved in this experimental set. Comparing this to alternative HTL-AP technologies such as anaerobic digestion the energy yield is comparable; Posmanik et al. (2018) et al. [53] obtained, for a variety of feedstocks and HTL processing temperatures, a biomethane yield of approximately 150 L/ kgCOD on average, which translates to 1.4 kWh CH4 /kg COD. Only around half of the COD is converted in the AD study leading to 2.8 kWh CH4 /kg COD removed. Similarly, Shen et al. (2018) [54] used a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) to treat HTL-AP and produced 5 mmol H2/ g COD removed. In the current study approximately 12 mmol/ g COD removed was achieved with production rates of 168 ml H2/L/day in the MEC versus 43,000 ml H2/L/day in the current EO study. However, it must be stressed that the energy consumption is much higher for EO than for MEC and anerobic digestion technologies and therefore not directly comparable in terms of a total energy balance. Additionally, in the current EO study achieved 46 gCOD/L and 35 gCOD/L reduction in a charge time of 5 A∙h for wheat straw and sewage sludge HTL-AP respectively, while the quoted MEC study achieved reductions of 6 gCOD/L and the AD study 2.8 g COD/L."
10,Integration of HTL process with the EO-HTL-AP,"3.4 Integration of HTL process with the EO-HTL-AP EO techniques can be adjusted to different applications, and can be readily integrated with other technologies [55]. However, the EO processes have not yet reached commercial maturity due to the relatively high cost of electricity. Likewise, the energy balance of the HTL treatment is known to be unfavorable if the water content of the feedstock exceeds 90% [56]. Regarding this, it is important to assess the energy balance for an integrated system, which includes the HTL process and EO. In order to determine the energy balance of the integrated HTL-EO technology, the energy return on investment (EROI) was assessed based on the studies [4,33] and calculations from Eqs. (9) to (12). The EROI values for HTL of wheat straw and sewage sludge without EO were determined considering only the main requirements of the HTL process (trim heater, reactor, feeding pump). In the present study the cost for EO system was estimated from the experiments performed at 45.7 mA∙cm−2 and scaled up accordingly with the volume of the HTL-AP produced from the continuous HTL process of wheat straw and sewage sludge. It has to be noted that all calculations have been performed for one hour of operation. The results on the assessment of the EROI values for the integrated HTL-EO process is illustrated in Table 4 . The EROI of the HTL process alone was shown to be positive. The higher EROI values of the HTL of the sewage sludge can be explained by higher dry matter (DM) and higher yield of bio-oil and its higher caloric value. The integration of the EO unit with the HTL pilot plant decreases the EROI value by 2 and 1.6 times for WS and SS, respectively. However, it is still positive, thereby demonstrating potential of applicability of the EO unit integrated to the HTL pilot plant. On the other hand, at 45.7 mA∙cm−2 after 1A∙h the COD removal rates reached only 14.5 and 20.6% for the HTL-AP-WS abd HTL-AP-SS, respectively. Therefore, EO cannot be considered as a complete treatment but as a pretreatment step in a combined process with biological treatment at 45.7 mA∙cm−2. Furthermore, the EO of the HTL-AP over bipolar BDD could also generate hourly about 21 and 22% ((v/v)) of the hydrogen required for the on-site upgrading of the bio-oil products derived from the HTL of the WS and SS, respectively. It is worth mentioning that about 0.004 kWh is required to produce 1 L of H2 in a conventional water electrolysis [57], hence consuming ~10 times lower energy than our approach (0.044 and 0.035 kWh/L H2 for the EO of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively). This means that the electric EC should be still reduced by proper optimization."
11,Fate of organics in the HTL-AP,"3.5 Fate of organics in the HTL-AP One of the difficulties associated with the optimization process of the EO-HTL-AP is their complex and unknown composition, which prevents the determination of the electro-degradation pathway and consequently its optimization. The details of main compounds identified through GC–MS analysis (Fig.S1 in the Supporting information) and were classified into the groups depending on their structure and nature. The HTL-AP-WS mainly consists of the organic acids (acetic, butanoic, isopentanoic acid, pentadioic acids, 2-oxopentanoic acid, etc.) followed by anhydrides (butanoic and isobutanoic acid anhydrides), ketones (acetone), cyclic ketones (cyclopentanone, n-methylpentanones, methylated cyclopentenones) and aromatic compounds (benzenediols, phenolic compounds, etc), etc. Moreover, the presence of esters (diethylene glycol diacetate and dipropanates) is also observed. Nitrogen containing aromatic compounds (mainly pyridinic compounds) were classified into NAs, while short chain amines and carbamates were categorized as the nitrogen compounds. The HTL-AP-SS showed the presence of similar class components, but with a rich spectrum of the nitrogen containing aromatic compounds, namely pyrrolidines, pyrazines, pyridines, due to the different macromolecular composition of the initial feedstock containing a larger protein fraction. Fig. 5 illustrates the degradation rates of the main compound classes based on the Areaaf.tr./Areainit values of the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS components within electrolysis time at the current densities of 45.7 and 145.7 mA·cm−2, since the maximum and minimum efficiencies of COD removal rates were observed for these current densities. From Fig. 5b it can be seen that even at the early stage of the reactions more than half of most groups in the HTL-AP-WS were degraded apart from organic acids. The aromatic compounds, nitrogen containing aromatic compounds, cyclic ketones, ketones decomposed to CO2 faster than anhydrides, nitrogen compounds and esters for the experiment performed at the current density of 145.7 mA∙cm−1. The same trend of the disappearance of these compound classes were observed at 49.7 mA∙cm−2, but with 2 or 3 fold slower degradation rate (Fig. 5a). It should be pointed out that a wide variety of organic compounds, such as phenols and nitrogen compounds are considered as inhibitory substances for AD. In comparison to AD, electrochemical oxidation can remove more than half of these components within 2A∙h of charge time. The degradation order of the HTL-AP-SS compounds were similar to the removal trend of the organics of the HTL-AP-WS, but the decomposition of the NAs and aliphatic nitrogen compounds were found to be more resistant to the EO treatment due to their higher concentration and their richer diversity (Fig. 5 c and d). The accumulation of organic acids was previously reported and it was explained by their low hydroxyl radical rate constant values that are reported to be 1 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than phenols and aromatic components [58]. In the present study the higher value of the Areaaf.tr./Areainit than 1 for the organic acids also indicates that organic acids are the intermediates of the decomposition of other compound classes. For instance, the course of anodic oxidation of aldehydes and ketones generally follows the routes observed in chemical oxidation and lead to the generation of a mixture of acids [59,60]. Similarly, the electrochemical degradation of phenols are also known to proceed through the formation of mono- and dicarboxylic acids after ring cleavage [32]. The dominant EO mechanism of the NAs is an electrophilic attack of hydroxyl radicals [61] that enhance the transformation of the nitrogen atoms into nitro groups followed by their further release from the aromatic ring. Afterwards, the ring opening takes place and organic acids are formed as intermediates. In general, the persistency of the organic compounds can be related to their molecular and skeletal structures [62,63]. For instance, chemical compounds are known to contain electron donating (EDG) and electron withdrawing groups (EWG). Compounds with strong EDG (carboxylic acids, amides, halogens and nitro compounds, etc.) have been found to be effectively removed, while other compounds containing strong EWG (amines, alkoxy, hydroxylic, alkylic and acylic groups) are hard to be degraded [63,64], which is in a good agreement with the results of the present study. It should be also pointed out that the degradability of the compounds containing both EDG and EWG is more complicated, as it depends on the opposing effects if these functional groups. For example, 3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid and/or 2-hydroxy-6-methyl-pyridine-3-carboxylic acids present in the HTL-AP-SS are well degraded despite having –COOH group. Due to the abundance of the organic acids in the initial HTL-APs, the effluents before and after EO treatment were analyzed for the content of volatile acids (Fig.S2 in the Supporting material). According to the results obtained, acetic and propionic acids are prevalent in the initial solutions and effluents after the EO treatment. In both cases the EO led to the accumulation of acetic acid at the beginning of the treatment as a consequence of the electro-degradation of other pollutants. The content of acetic acid then reduced after 2 h of the electrolysis and reached 4.8 and 0.03 g/L at 145.7 mA∙cm−2 for the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively. The overall concentration of the organic acids after 5 h of electrochemical oxidation of HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS accounted for around 44 and 99% of the remaining TOC of the solutions, respectively, thus demonstrating that a significant fraction of the recalcitrant compounds were in the form of organic acids at 145.7 mA∙cm−2. In comparison, at 49.7 mA∙ cm−2 organic acids sum up also around 23 and 39% of the remaining TOC for the HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS, respectively. In order to study the nature of other refractory compounds that are not detectable by GC–MS, the samples of HTL-AP-WS and HTL-AP-SS were collected after 3 h and 5 h of EO treatment at 49.7 mA∙ cm−2 and dried overnight at 105 °C to remove water. Afterwards, samples were analyzed by FTIR and thermal analyses and the results are given in Fig. S3 and Fig. S4. The FTIR and TGA analysis showed that heavy molecular weight aromatic compounds containing C-O, C = O, OH stretches are less oxidizable by EO, which can be due to the presence of the rigid aromatic rings in the lignin fraction of the wheat straw [65]. From literature the electro-degradation of lignin and lignin-derived model compounds is known to proceed through several cycles of single electron transfers followed by Cα-Cβ cleavages [66]. As a result of this, different intermediates, such as aromatic acids and aldehydes can be formed. In general, the complete degradation of these recalcitrant compounds requires longer electrolysis time. The compositional difference in the HTL-AP solutions results in slightly different performance of the EO treatment. Higher amount of organic acids and the presence of less oxidizible heavy molecular weight aromatic compounds resulted in lower COD and TOC removal rates during the EO of the HTL-AP-WS. This information could be useful optimize and adjust the operating parameters of the EO process according to the initial composition of the HTL-AP in order to improve the process efficiency."
12,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates the possibility of an integrated HTL-EO process for anodic oxidation of the HTL-AP and simultaneous hydrogen production. It was shown that applying higher current density accelerates the COD removal efficiency at the expense of high energy consumption, while not significantly affecting the energy recovery from hydrogen production. A positive EROI is only possible when the current density below 50 mA∙cm−2. The lower COD removal rates of the EO -HTL-AP- WS for all current densities compared to the EO-HTL-AP-SS are due to the presence more refractory compounds, such as organic acids and high molecular weight lignin-derived aromatic species."
