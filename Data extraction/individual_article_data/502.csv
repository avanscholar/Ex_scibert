0,Introduction,"Sugar alcohols, named “polyols” or sugar replacers, are carbohydrates possessing a sweet sensation and functionalities but are neither sugars nor alcohols. They may be categorized as monosaccharide-derived (erythritol, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol), disaccharide-derived (isomaltitol, lactitol, maltitol, and trehalose), and polysaccharide-derived (hydrogenated starch hydrolysates). The chemical structures and properties of commonly used sugar alcohols are listed in Table 1 . They are naturally occurring in many fruits; but for commercial uses, they are manufactured from other carbohydrates including starch, sucrose, and glucose (Livesey, 2003; Park, Oh, Jo, Jin, & Seo, 2016). Sugar alcohols are considered as either generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or approved food additives by the FDA. They are sweeteners with reduced-calorie and commonly used in combination with other sweeteners to achieve desirable taste and sweetness level. These sugar substitutes contain somewhat fewer calories than sucrose, due mainly to being not well absorbed and even having a small laxative effect. Compared to sucrose or glucose, polyols have a lower glycemic response due to incompletely absorbed from the small intestine into the blood. Since sugar alcohols have a mono-, di-, or oligosaccharide carbohydrate structure, there exist diﬀerences in their metabolic fate in the human body. They are metabolized with little or no effect production of insulin once absorbed. Non-absorbed polyols enter the large intestine, where they are fermented by intestinal bacteria. Sugar alcohols have a laxative eﬀect upon consumed at high levels (Alonso & Setser, 1994). Individuals who take consumption of excessive amounts of polyols may experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as gas, diarrhea, and laxative effects, like over-intake of high-fiber foods and beans. Based on The American Dietetic Association advices, a daily intake of xylitol over 0.37 g/kg for males and 0.42 g/kg body weight for females (Oku & Nakamura, 2007), or 20 g of mannitol (Saulo, 2005), or over 92 g of maltitol would cause a laxative eﬀect. The laxative threshold value (LTV) for maltitol and erythritol are 60 g and 40 g, respectively (Levin, Zehner, & Saunders, 1995). Polyols do not promote tooth decay because bacteria in the mouth do not metabolize and convert these sweeteners into plaque or harmful acids. Xylitol even has inhibitory effect on oral bacteria. Hence, the FDA (1996) authorizes the use of the claim on labels of products containing sugar alcohols. The polyols as sweeteners of food additives are in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and were amended in No 1129/2011. With fewer calories than sucrose, they are frequently applied in sugar-free baked goods, cakes, cookies, candies, burger buns, chewing gum, ice cream, toothpastes, mouthwashes, breath mints, and pharmaceuticals (Rice, Zannini, Arendt, & Coffey, 2020). Most sugar alcohols are industrially produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of sugars under conditions of high temperature, high pressure, noble metal catalyst including platinum, argentum, lithium, and chromatographic purification steps, which lead to low yields of final product with expensive cost (Schiweck, Bär, Vogel, Schwarz, & Kunz, 2000; Park et al., 2016). Because of these drawbacks, biotechnological production of sugar alcohols has been actively pursued (Moon, Jeya, Kim, & Lee, 2010). For example, microbial fermentation offers safer and environmental-friendly processes to manufacture polyols. Typical commercially available sugar alcohols include sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol, and erythritol (Islam, 2011). Erythritol is the only sugar alcohol commercially produced by fermentation and contains four-carbon with about 60–80% of the sweetness of sucrose. It has been detected in the tissue and body fluids of humans and animals. Maltitol, known as α-d-glucopyranosyl-1,4-glucitol, is produced through maltose, which can be obtained by enzymatic degradation of starch. As a soluble hexahydric alcohol, it is derived from mannose or fructose through chemical hydrogenation of fructose, which yields a mixture of mannitol and sorbitol. Sorbitol, a hexahydric alcohol, is derived from glucose. It is isomeric with mannitol, manufactured by the catalytic reduction of glucose with hydrogen. Trehalose is commercially prepared from starch and is available as Ascend™. Trehalose could be utilized in foods and beverages including fruit juices, chocolate chips, nutrition bars, and dehydrated fruits and vegetables (Zhou, Peng, & Xu, 2007). Wheat dough bakery products are commonly consumed and widely welcome cereal foods, which represent staple foods, luxury gifts, snacks, infant foods, dietary products, pet foods, and decorated items with the addition of chocolate, cream, nuts, and other flavors. The dough is a comprehensive three-dimensional network structure with interaction among proteins, starch granules, water and entrapped air. As a crucial protein, gluten forms viscoelastic structure in dough and bread; while starches (amylose and amylopectin) also affect the structure properties of dough. During storage, bread would gradually be staled, which is associated with complex physical and chemical changes, including crumb firming, starch retrogradation, water migration and loss of flavor (Curti, Carini, & Vittadini, 2017). Starch retrogradation and water migration are two major factors to influence staling. In order to enhance structure, soften texture, and optimize processing, improvers including sugar alcohols, emulsifiers, enzymes, hydrocolloids have been gained popularity, which could deliver a stable and strong network, retarding staling, desirable taste and longer shelf-life in bread and other cereal foods (Ding & Yang, 2013; Korus, Witczak, Ziobro, & Juszczak, 2015; Huang, Guo, Wang, Ding, & Cui, 2016). For example, maltitol and sorbitol as sugar alcohols have potential as dough improver and antistaling agent in bread. Sugar alcohols are convenient for sucrose replacement since they can be added at an approximate 1:1 ratio to provide similar bulky capacity as sucrose. Due to non-reducing property, sugar alcohols do not participate in browning reactions during baking (Bhise & Kaur, 2014). Sugar alcohols with different levels were widely utilized in baked products (Peng, Qin, & Ding, 2018; Shariati et al., 2018; Kheirabadi, Hojattoleslamy, & Molavi, 2015; Martínez-Cervera, Salvador, & Sanz, 2014; Manisha, Soumya, & Indrani, 2012; Ghosh & Sudha, 2012; Ronda, Gomez, Blanco, & Caballero, 2005; Zoulias, Piknis, & Oreopoulou, 2000; Baeva, Panchev, & Terzieva, 2000), which has been summarized in Table 2 . These compounds with value-added properties in terms of functionality and health benefits could drive an array of applications. For instance, there is a vast scope of improving the nutritional quality of the bakery products to customize demand with healthier ingredients as well as to make it more nutritious and tastier (Arepally, Reddy, Goswami, & Datta, 2020). They were also widely used in sugar-reduced products as a nutritive sweetener. The possibility of replacing sugar in cake formulations by an equal amount of mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, and lactitol has been extensively examined (Psimouli & Oreopoulou, 2012; Martínez-Cervera et al., 2014). Erythritol, with high digestive tolerance, safe for diabetics, and antioxidant properties, is noncaloric, non-cariogenic, and nonglycemic (Regnat, Mach, & Mach-Aigner, 2018). Erythritol are used in bakery products such as candy and cake. Upon the combination of erythritol with fats such as butter, the cooling effect can make the texture waxy. Mannitol can serve as a sweetener, humectant, and bulking agent, and is used in sugarless candy, chewing gum, cereal, and pressed mints. Olinger and Velasco (1996) have found the softening effect of biscuit after the addition of sugar alcohols such as maltitol, sorbitol and isomalt in manufacturing biscuit. However, like that of control, cookie presented a hardness characteristic after adding lactitol. Erythritol is often combined with maltitol in bakery applications to increase sweetness and humectant properties. The diﬀerence between maltitol and erythritol in the body is that maltitol is slowly and partially absorbed after enzymatic digestion; while erythritol has a minimal caloric value through fermentation in the large intestine (Grembecka, 2015). Adding sorbitol into foods can prevent the drying of food and make food stay fresh and soft. Its application in bread cake has a significant effect; while adding it to the concentrated milk can extend the shelf life. It does not contain an aldehyde group and is not easily oxidized. Due to a reducing-sugar, it does not have a Maillard reaction with amino acids upon heating. It can prevent the denaturation of the carotenoids, edible fats and protein (Manisha et al., 2012). Trehalose, found in honey, mushrooms, and shrimp, is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules. It is produced by the body. Trehalose has half sweet as sucrose and possesses a low insulin response. It is heat stable and stabilizes proteins, serving as a biological preservative by protecting cell structure and being useful in freezing and thawing processes in maintaining a desired texture. Xylitol is a ﬁve-carbon polyol and adopts a linear and symmetrical conformation in which four out of the ﬁve hydroxyl groups of the molecule are oriented in the same direction, leading to forming a surface that is able to bind water more readily by a cooperative effect. It is a prevalent sugar substitute found in a wide variety of foods (Sahin, Axel, Zannini, & Arendt, 2018). What sugar reduction faces challenging in bakery industry is that sugar interacts significantly with various ingredients, leading to an increase in gelatinization temperature, a delay in gluten network development, an increase or decrease in yeast activity depending on the sugar level, enhancing emulsification, enhancing non-enzymatic browning, and contributing surface cracking due to recrystallization (Sahin, Zannini, Coffey, & Arendt, 2019). One of strategies in reducing sugar is to incorporate sweet bulking ingredients, such as sugar alcohols. Although sugar alcohols are not essential nutrients, their multiple potential health effects including non-cariogenic property in sugar-free tooth pastes, low-glycemic index for lowering diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, low-energy and low-insulinaemic activities in potentially reducing obesity, low-digestible for benefits in the colon, and osmotic functions for helps in colon-hydrating, laxative and purifying, have drawn great deal of attention (Livesey, 2003; Martínez, Pico, & Gómez, 2015). Polyols have been reviewed from biotechnological production, nutrition, digestion, metabolism and utilization perspectives as well as regulation (Rice et al., 2020); however, few studies have been considered in rheological properties, functionalities and roles in processing. Hence, this review will specifically focus on their process functionalities and texture contributions in bread, and further provide insights in utilization of sugar alcohols in bakery industry."
1,Dough rheological properties affected by sugar alcohols,"The dough with a consistent structure is a network containing starch, protein, water, and other minor compositions such as sugar replacement and salt. Physicochemical and rheological properties of dough including swelling power, water absorption capacity, kneading torque, thermal attributes, gelatinization, retrogradation, and texture were signiﬁcantly affected by the addition of sugar alcohols. The Farinograph and Extensograph tests have revealed that the addition of xylitol in a wheat dough lowered water absorption, significantly increased development, and stability time of dough. In the meanwhile, xylitol significantly enhanced stretching energy, extension degree and stretching resistance (Wang, Dong, Liu, & Yao, 2012). Adding xylitol could significantly reduce the peak viscosity, attenuation value, final viscosity, retrogradation value, and further effectively decreased the starch aging speed. Sun, Nan, Dai, Ji, and Xiong (2014) have indicated that the three types of sugar alcohols (maltitol, erythritol, and xylitol) in high concentration (1:1) inhibited swelling power of wheat starch. At 95 °C, the swelling power lowered signiﬁcantly with an increasing sugar alcohol content. The three types of sugar alcohols signiﬁcantly increased the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of wheat starch. Pasting properties of dough in presence and absence of sucrose or polyols could be characterized using a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA). Martínez et al. (2015) have examined the influence of 4 polyols (maltitol, sorbitol, xylitol and mannitol) on wheat and maize starches paste and gel properties, in comparison with those made only from native starches and their combinations with sucrose. The results indicated that polyols displayed an effect on starch properties similar to those of sucrose. The peak viscosity, setback, and gel hardness were increased; while brightness of L value was reduced after the addition of polyols. The polyol which exhibited more similar results to those made from sucrose was maltitol in all experiments. It was also reported that xylitol was the polyol which changed the native starch properties to a lesser extent in RVA curve, gel rheology and hardness. Those finding showed that pasting and gelation properties of starches with addition of polyols have a strong influence on the process. However, the results (Zoulias et al., 2000) in a study of sucrose replacement by polyols or fructose on dough rheology and properties in low-fat cookies were not consistent with the above ones. Maltitol gave rise in dough with high values of hardness and consistency as well as low adhesiveness and cohesiveness; while lactitol, sorbitol and xylitol showed the opposite effect. Maltitol resulted in dough with high values of hardness and consistency and low adhesiveness and cohesiveness, while lactitol, sorbitol and xylitol showed the opposite effect. It was also revealed that lactitol and sorbitol made improvement of the texture of low-fat cookies, leading to softer and less brittle. Xylitol affected texture favorably, but not flavor. Mannitol was observed not suitable for cookie formulation, as it restricts spread and imparts undesirable flavor and appearance in the cookies. Wang et al. (2012) have found that the addition of xylitol into wheat dough could significantly lower the peak viscosity, attenuation value, final viscosity, retrogradation value and peak time of dough. Maltitol and sorbitol could decrease the hardness, gumminess, chewiness and springiness of dough (Ding, Peng, Li, & Yang, 2019; Peng et al., 2018). Low addition of sugar alcohols (within 6% of flour, dry base) didn't impact a significant effect on the gelatinization properties of dough and wheat starch, while high addition level did. The result of determined by DSC similarly indicated that the use of maltitol could remarkably enhance the gelatinization temperature (p < 0.05) of wheat flour. The discrepancy in results may be ascribed to different raw ingredient tested, and methodologies used. No matter what it was, it was in accordance with that sugar alcohols added into dough made the gelatinization temperature increase. Sahin et al. (2018) have recently revealed the influence of three polyols on dough and product quality of burger buns. They incorporated xylitol, mannitol and maltitol individually into a burger bun system to substitute added sucrose by 30%, 50% and 100%, respectively. The gluten network formation was measured by using GlutoPeak. The torque maximum (TM) and the peak maximum time (PMT) were evaluated at of 36 °C. The TM represents the strength of the gluten network. The PMT is the duration the gluten network needs to be developed. It was monitored that gluten network development was delayed, and extensibility was decreased with increasing concentrations, as shown in Fig. 1 . It was interesting to show that maltitol and xylitol did not influence the pasting properties, whereas mannitol increased pasting temperature (+15 °C). Furthermore, polyols did not affect the viscoelastic properties of the dough. The mechanisms of action in sugar alcohols' effect on dough properties are diverse. Sugar alcohols are capable of forming hydrogen bond between starch chains in the amorphous regions in starch granules, which would restrict starch swelling and thereby would stabilize these regions. It was hypothesized that polyols increased the gelatinization temperature by forming polyol-starch intermolecular interactions in the starch amorphous regions (Sun et al., 2014; Allan, Rajwa, & Mauer, 2018). Polyols with more equatorial and exocyclic OH groups tended to increase the gelatinization temperature more, suggesting that polyols’ stereochemistry could play a role. The types of OH groups present in a polyol solution depend on the stereochemistry, and the ring structural conformation of boat or chair. Relatively, the reactivity of the OH groups follows the order of exocyclic > equatorial > axial (Miljković, 2010). The number and types of OH groups in polyols affected the H-bonding among polyols, starch and gluten. The greater number of H-bonding was, the stronger the effect was. The influence of the number of OH groups on onset Tgels of wheat starch was investigated (Allan et al., 2018). With an increase of the number of OH groups, the Tgel also increased, likely because the solute was forming more H-bonds with starch. The availability of water molecules competing within starch and polyols, the consequent reduction of the water activity, and the decrease of the free volume of sugar alcohol-water solvent appear to lead to a reduced plasticizing effect of the solvent (Wang et al., 2012). In terms of rheological properties of dough, adding polyols showed a greater effect on the viscosity. Like sugar, maltitol made an increase of the viscosity of dough. However, both xylitol and erythritol, as monosaccharide alcohol, generated a lower viscosity. The reason may be attributed to the difference in molecular weight, spatial structure and the number of OH groups (Zoulias et al., 2000)."
2,Rate of fermentation and specific volume influenced by sugar alcohols,"Generally speaking, sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol and lactitol are all slowly fermented to acid by oral bacteria, and xylitol is virtually non-fermentable. However, polyols could not be utilized and fermented by yeast. The fermentation rate was low in the present of sugar alcohols in comparison with the absence of sugar alcohols (Ding et al., 2019). Upon replacing the sugar with sorbitol or maltitol, the fermentation rate was remarkably low, as shown in Fig. 2 . It indicates that dough with maltitol had an overall slower fermentation rate, compared to the control. Furthermore, there is a diﬀerence in bread speciﬁc volume between control and 6% of maltitol addition (p < 0.05). A descending tendency in speciﬁc volume contributed by an increase in maltitol was monitored. Maltitol, as an unfermentable sugar, could not be utilized by yeast, which had a retarding eﬀect on dough fermentation and less production of CO2. Similar results had been reported in previous study (Sun et al., 2014), which used xylitol to investigate eﬀect on bread qualities. The specific volume of sugar alcohol bread was significantly smaller than control, as also reported by others (Wang et al., 2015; Hao et al., 2016). In the study of the application of sugar alcohol in the sponge cake (Niu, 2017), the microstructure of dough was observed by SEM. The findings indicated that the number and the total area of bubbles in the mannitol-containing dough were significantly smaller than those in the sucrose (control group); while the number and the total area of bubbles with erythritol were smaller than that in the sucrose. However, the number and the total area of bubbles in the batter containing xylitol, sorbitol and maltitol were not significantly different from those of the sucrose group. It was concluded that xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol were more suitable as a substitute for sucrose. The specific volume of bread significant smaller than control after the replacement of sugar with polyols, which could be explained by growth and reproduction of the yeast as well as protein's denaturation. Since yeasts do not utilize the sugar alcohols for the carbon source, growth and reproduction of yeast are slowed down, resulting in yeast's ability to produce CO2 drops, and further growth rate of volume of fermented dough is lower than the control. It was found that both sugars and polyols can stabilize proteins against heat denaturation, leading to the enhancement of the gas-holding. But the capability of the polyols was weaker than sugars (Hao et al., 2016), as indicated by the temperature of protein denaturation would be lower once sugar partial substitution with polyols in the formulation. The capability of holding gas reduced; therefore, the specific volume in sugar alcohol-bread was smaller than ones in sugar-bread. Additionally, the disulfide bond content of dough exhibited a decreasing trend and the free sulfhydryl groups showed an increasing trend in the addition of polyols, implying that polyols had a retarding effect for gluten network formation, which would lower the holding gas capability of dough (Liu, Zhou, Tran, & Labuza, 2009). It was reported that, compared to sugar-rich doughs, polyols lowered the fermentation quality, resulting in lower dough development and less gaseous release (Sahin et al., 2018). The addition of polyols resulted in a significant decrease in specific volume (−30 to −48%), and in a harder crumb texture (+135 to +678%). The authors have found that a reduction of 50% added sucrose by polyols was applicable, whereas mannitol was the most suitable sugar replacer amongst three polyols. The mechanism of polyols' effect on protein was complicated. Usually, sugars increase the thermal stability of proteins in aqueous solutions by changing their hydration properties. Extensive hydrogen bonding between polyhydroxy compounds and water stabilizes the native conformation of proteins. Also, the presence of polyol can intensify hydrophobic interactions inside a protein and confer resistance against denaturation since polyol solutions are less favored solvents than water for a polar amino acid. Therefore, it would require much more work to elucidate hydrophobic groups in the interior of the protein to polyol solutions than to water. The study from Campbell, Raikos, and Euston (2003) have suggested that polyols stabilized proteins against heat denaturation, not only by directly interacting with them but also by altering the structure of water, and hence strengthen the hydrophobic interactions of proteins. Steric exclusion was documented as the dominant mechanism of the preferential interactions between the protein surface and the cosolvent-solvent molecules (Timasheff, 2002). Liu, Ji, Zhang, Dong, and Sun (2010) have elucidated the molecular basis for polyol-induced protein stability using molecular dynamics simulations of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. Protein protection by polyols was highly associated with both the molecular volume and the fractional polar surface area, and the former makes more contribution to the protein's stability. Polyol molecules have only a few direct hydrogen bonds with the protein. Therefore, the direct interactions have little effect on the stabilizing effect. As for linear polyols such as xylitol and erythritol, their chain length acts as a main factor that affects their stabilizing ability. Maltitol possesses relatively large molecular size, so its preferential exclusion from the nonpolar surface of proteins increased. The preferential exclusion of polyols causes indirect interactions that prevent the protein from thermal unfolding. This work suggested that polyols protect the protein from thermal unfolding through indirect interactions. Based on loop-train reported by Belton (1999), β-sheet structures (trains) are naturally less elastic than β-turn (loops) in gluten protein. Anything that transforms the β-spiral structure into intermolecular β-sheet structure would negatively influence the quality of bread crumb. Pourfarzad, Ahmadian, and Habibi-Najafi (2018) have examined the interactions between polyols and wheat biopolymers in a bread model system using a Fourier transform infrared study. It showed that intramolecular β-sheets were almost increased upon an increase of polyol proportion in the models. Polyol supplement displayed an unfavorable effect on loaf volume of bread due to destruction of the β-spiral structure. In the secondary structures of gluten, β-spiral compositions can be considered as repeated β-turns and are recognized as one of the structural features relevant to the viscoelasticity of dough."
3,Distribution and migration of moisture in sugar alcohol-bread,"The development of baked products involves maximizing the moisture content to produce the best possible consumable qualities while minimizing aw. Sugar alcohols can act as effective humectants, thus depressing the aw. On the other hand, polyols possess high affinity for water to lead to a greater water competition with flour hydration during mixing and alter moisture migration and distribution in the storage. It was well known that water content and its distribution play a vital role in the properties of dough and bread, especially during the storage. Commonly, water migration occurred from the crumb towards the crust during bread storage. The distribution and status of moisture in bread directly affect the quality of bread, including hardness of crumb, mouthfeel, chewiness. In the meantime, water amount and redistribution influence starch crystallites formed. The relationship between bread quality and moisture have been paid much attentions by different research groups (Ribotta & Le Bail, 2007; Curti et al., 2017; Ding et al., 2019). In order to clarify the relationship, it is paramount to pursue a suitable research method and tool to quantify moisture. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) is a useful tool to assess the interaction among water, starch and gluten in the matrix. Through measuring the spin-spin relaxation time (T2), the status of water molecules with different mobility could be identified, which help us understand the moisture content and migration in food matrix (Khan, Wellard, Nagy, Joardder, & Karim, 2016). Peng, Li, Ding, and Yang (2017) have conducted study in distribution of moisture using LF-NMR in bread. As shown in Fig. 3 , the x-axis is associated with moisture and a longer T2 indicates a higher degree of freedom in water molecule; while the y-axis represents the signal amplitude of protons. The peak area expresses a relative content of water in each part (Li et al., 2012). T2 was used to confirm the water migration and distribution in the samples. There were three peaks of T21 (0.4–2 ms), T22 (4–20 ms), T23 (40–200 ms), which represent bound water, immobilized water (unfreezable water), and free water (freezable water), respectively, in the bread stored for 4 h. Bound water was firmly trapped in the starch granules and gluten network; while free water was no interacted with other molecules. The mobility of both types of water was relatively less to be influenced. As for T22, an immobilized one, water molecules were linked to the other biomacromolecules in the system and may easily be affected by storage conditions. It has been reported that water in bread becomes more bound or immobilized during staling due to its incorporation into crystalline starch and the possible transition of water within the amorphous domains, some of which undergo aging, thus changing hydration behavior (Ribotta & Le Bail, 2007). Hydration behavior of starch would become different with the addition of polyols. The softening effect of polyols could be attributed to their water retention capacity. Polyols tend to stabilize water-starch systems by becoming incorporated in the structure of the water that surrounds the starch chains. For instance, the interaction of polyols such as glycerol with water makes the water “unfreezable”, resulting in a reduction of freezable water in the system. LF-NMR can visually clarify the interaction between polyols and water. Using the same tool of LF-NMR technology, water mobility and distribution in bread with incorporation of sorbitol (Peng et al., 2018) or maltitol (Ding et al., 2019) have been assessed. Sorbitol could increase the water-bonding capacity and improve the tasting properties of bread. The slowly digestible starch content in bread was lower than the control, suggesting that sorbitol could descend the degree of aging of the sample. The study from Mantzari, Raphaelides, and Exarhopoulos (2010) also indicated that the moisture uptake rate was proportional to sorbitol level in the starch system tested. Maltitol has the potential to bind more water molecules, being ascribed to its structure of 9 OH groups. The hydrogen bond network in the starch-based matrices with maltitol was stronger than that with sucrose. Therefore, less water molecules could be trapped in starch granules or bound to glutens. Water tends to move to the molecules which are easy to form hydrogen bonds, thus water molecules play a role to act as a “bridge” to connect different biomacromolecules rather than starch chains and gluten network alone. Consequently, due to the existence of maltitol, there is a weaker interaction between water and starch chains or gluten network. It was found that sugars boosted hydrogen bond strength in the order: trehalose > maltitol (Liang, Wang, & Ludescher, 2015). The hydrogen bond network in the starch-based matrices with maltitol was stronger than that with sucrose, due mainly to a smaller molecule possessing more free molecular volume, which signifies that the OH in maltitol easily forms hydrogen bonds (Roussenova, Murith, Alam, & Ubbink, 2010). Xylitol added into dough could improve bread baking characteristics, including a decrease in hardness, an increase in moisture content, stabilization of volume of bread, and extension of shelf life. The effect of polyols on aw has been reported in burger buns (Sahin et al., 2018). It appears that maltitol and xylitol could bind free water stronger than sucrose, giving rise to a lower aw. Xylitol lowered aw more than maltitol did, most likely because of its smaller molecular weight and higher hygroscopicity. However, mannitol acted on aw significantly diﬀerent from maltitol and xylitol. It seems that the more amount of mannitol added, the higher of aw, which might be explained by its non-hygroscopic property, and further lead to a higher aw due to more free water available in the system. Because of no aldehyde group, polyols are non-fermentable by yeast/fungi and resistant to bacterial degradation, which makes an extension of shelf life. In general, sugar alcohols added into dough could modulate bread baking characteristics. During bread storage, polyols could affect the migration and redistribution of moisture, and furthermore adjusted the bread aging and quality. Currently, data concerning how sugar alcohols affect the molecular mobility and interaction forces in the starch and other components in the matrix in the microscopic level are limited. Atomic force microscope (AFM) could be a promising tool in capturing more information about interaction forces between moisture and starch (Zhong & Wang, 2019)."
4,Starch retrogradation of bread incorporated with sugar alcohols,"It is commonly known that sugar alcohols interfere with starch chains with the hydrogen bonds in starch-water-polyol systems, stabilize starch gels, and thus retard retrogradation. The rate of retrogradation is lowered by polyols. During bread storage, physical and chemical changes in the product may be occur, for example, crumb firming, water migration, starch retrogradation, and loss of flavor (Curti et al., 2017), indicating the characteristics of bread staling. Bread staling is a very complex process that is involved in amylopectin retrogradation, reorganization of polymers within the amorphous region, loss of moisture content, distribution of moisture between the amorphous and crystalline zone, and participation of macroscopic structure of crumb (Rojas, Rosell, & Benedito de, 2001). Among those factors, starch retrogradation and moisture migration are two main ones played key role in influencing bread staling. RVA rheological data showed that the setback of dough has gradually reduced from 1387 RVU to 842 RVU with adding xylitol increased from 4% to 16% (dry based flour) (Wang et al., 2012), demonstrating that incorporating xylitol could significantly cause a delay in retrogradation. Similar outcomes were observed by Sun et al. (2014). Maltitol, erythritol, and xylitol could postpone the retrogradation of wheat starch. It is believed that sugar alcohols play a role in inhibiting the retrogradation in starchy foods. Pourfarzad et al. (2011) have studied the effect of four polyols on the stale in Barbari bread during 14 days of storage at 25 °C. The result of bread's hardness was presented in Fig. 4 . As far as fresh bread, the addition of glycerol, sorbitol, maltitol, and propylene glycerol did not generate a significant effect on the texture. With respect to sorbitol-supplemented bread, during the 1st and 2nd days of storage, the hardness was not significantly different from the control. Two days later, an increase in hardness of bread was observed, but was lower than the control in both 1% and 5% of the sorbitol levels, which could attribute to the plasticizing effect of the sorbitol on starch/gluten biopolymers. These plasticizers could restrain the cross-links of starch molecules (Pommet, Redl, Guilbert, & Morel, 2005; Curti et al., 2017). Propylene glycol showed the most remarkable effect on reducing hardness at level 5%, possibly being attributed to its moisturizing effect. On the other hand, it was found that bread staling increased by the addition of maltitol (5g/100 g) (Pourfarzad et al., 2011), which was inconsistent with the results from other research groups (Ding et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2018). Pourfarzad et al. (2011) have monitored that the crumb moisture in the bread reduced by addition of maltitol between 3 and 14 days stored in comparison with the control, hence, addition of maltitol improved an increase of staling. With an increasing storage time, amylopectin recrystallization increased due to the high molecular weight and glass transition of maltitol, resulting in moisture distribution change, and partitioning away from the more tightly associated water (Liu et al., 2009). Texture quantification (Sun et al., 2014) revealed that hardness of wheat starch gel rose with increasing level of sugar alcohols, indicating that sugar alcohols probably facilitated the retrogradation of amylose, which follows the order of xylitol > maltitol > erythritol at a sugar alcohol and starch ratio of 2:1. Such effects might be contributed to more hydrogen bonds formed between sugar alcohols and starch chains, leading to greater energy needed to break down during gelatinization of starch granules. Some hypotheses are associated with sugar alcohols and bread staling. Sugar alcohols can act as plasticizers. Typically, plasticizers are molecules with low molar mass and consequently greater free volume. In high concentration, the addition of plasticizers such as glycerol and other small molecules to starch will lower the glass transition temperature (Tg) and make the material properties more rubber-like (De Graaf, Karman, & Janssen, 2003). However, at low concentration with starch, glycerol can serve as an antiplasticizer, decreasing elongation at break as well as the moisture and oxygen permeability (Zhang & Han, 2010; Roussenova et al., 2010). With respect to polyols, the effect on retrogradation depended on their concentration in formula: at low concentration, the effect was antiplastical, which was in favor of the staling of bread, and vice versa. Due to difference in molecule size, structure, and so on, the critical concentration of each polyols varies. Gaudin, Lourdin, Forssell, and Colonna (2000) have also elucidated that the existence of two competitive eﬀects: one associated with a decrease in mobility (anti-plasticization effect) at low sorbitol content (<27%) and the other with the enhanced mobility (plasticization function) in a starch-sorbitol-water system. The relative importance of these two eﬀects seems to be reversed, depending on sorbitol content, which could account for the changes observed at the macroscopic level. Another hypothesis is hydration effect. Polyols affect the staling of bread by changing the activity of water. The incorporation of polyols significantly decreased the apparent moisture content at 0 day, thereby making the Barbari breads potentially more stable (Pourfarzad et al., 2011). However, the aw was significantly reduced by only propylene glycol treatment from 0.883 (control bread) to 0.871 (1% of propylene glycol) and 0.867 (5% of propylene glycol). With reference to crumb hardness and moisture evaluation, it was proved that sorbitol and propylene glycol were able to decrease and delay the staling effect. There exists a competition for water molecules between polyols and flour constituents during dough mixing. Polyols were more prone to forming hydrogen bond with water molecules than gluten, resulting in a negative effect on the gluten network. It is also possible that polyols exert their negative effects by redistributing water from the gluten to the polyols and causing partial dehydration and/or conformational changes in the gluten network (Bock, Connelly, & Damodaran, 2013; Li et al., 2012). The highly hygroscopic attribute of polyols has been implicated in their ability to retard staling by forming an entangled amorphous matrix around the starch molecules via disrupting the hydrogen bond between neighboring protein strands as well as via reducing interchain attractive forces. Such a matrix may also contribute to the increased chain mobility, flexibility and homogeneity of the water distribution in the sample. Additively, some chemical reactions between starch-lipid or starch-protein interfere the staling of bread. Consider those chemical reactions, water has a good solvent effect and increases the mobility of the reactants to speed up reaction, which is so-called the solvent effect. On the other hand, water can dilute the reactants to reduce the reactive rate, which is the dilution effect. The solvent effect of water affects the mobility of starch molecules and the rate of recrystallization. When the water content was lower and the mobility of starch molecules was lower, solvent effect was main, dilution effect was secondary. Which effect has a greater impact to reaction, depending on the content of water, or rather, activity of water (aw) in the matrix. Due to the addition of sugar alcohols, aw was markedly affected by factors of sugar alcohols, including the number of OH group, the spatial configuration of molecule, and molecule weight. The exact mechanism of how sugar alcohols affect staling of bread are still arguable and needed to be further investigated and elucidated."
5,Conclusion,"Sugar alcohols or polyols, a group of reduced calorie sweeteners, are the natural and nutritive sweeteners. They are a group of low digestible carbohydrates which can be utilized instead of sucrose. As approval by the FDA as food additives, polyols can be directly added to products for human consumption. The bakery products incorporated with sugar alcohols could not only assist in maintaining oral health, managing weight, controlling blood glucose levels, thus lowering the risk of certain lifestyle-associated diseases, but also modulating processability, improving sensory and textural properties similar to those produced from sugar-sweetened bakery products. Polyols are commercially available either in solid crystalline form or syrups. They provide the baker a versatile range of ingredients to enhance the available portfolio of products, to influence processability, to blend well with regular sugars and flavors, and improve quality of finished products. Upon the utilization of polyols in practice, some challenges included high affinity for water, low capacity to crystallize, inability to be fermented by yeast, absence of Maillard reaction, viscosity lowering effect in cake batters, and a laxative effect with high usage levels; while some advantages of using polyols contain comparable sweetness, relatively low caloric content, serving as bulking and filling agent, lowering aw, and increasing freeze/thawing stability in frozen dough. To meet consumers’ health demands and improve the processability, a growing application of sugar alcohols is being delivered into baked products and other foods. Although some recent studies have confirmed human health benefits and process roles of sugar alcohols using advance analytical tools such as LF-NMR and AFM, the mechanisms of action and functionalities of polyols were still from being fully understood and clarified. This work highlights the effect of sugar alcohols on dough rheology, specific volume, moisture migration and distribution, and staling in bread, which are associated with starch pasting, gelatinization, crystallization, interaction among polyols, starch, proteins, and water matrix."
