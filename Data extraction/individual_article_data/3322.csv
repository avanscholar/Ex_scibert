0,Introduction,"Chiral alcohols, including secondary and primary alcohols, are a common type of optically active chemicals. As chiral building blocks or chiral sources, secondary and primary alcohols play important roles in medicine, cosmetic production, and food chemistry. Lipase-catalyzed resolution is an effective method to produce optically pure enantiomers [1–3]. Therefore, the mechanism of chiral-recognition of alcohols by lipases has become a research hotspot over the last few years. Kazlauskas et al. [4] investigated the resolution of 94-pairs of enantiomers of chiral alcohols catalyzed by lipases including PcL (Pseudomonas cepacia lipase), and proposed an empirical law of enantiopreference: the stereo-specific catalytic cavity of the enzyme contains large and small pockets that fit, respectively, the large and small group on the chiral center of the preferred enantiomer. This groundbreaking law was considered to be the origin of enantioselectivity by lipases [5,3]. Based on this law and using various genetic approaches, a number of studies on improving, manually altering lipase's enantioselectivity and even reversing the enantiopreference were reported [6–8]. Moreover, researchers were able to quantitatively predict with reasonable precision the enantioselectivity ratio of particular lipase-catalyzed resolution of chiral compounds using modern computational tools such as molecular docking and QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) calculation [9,10]. Nonetheless, the success of these studies was only based on secondary alcohols, whose chiral center is the hydroxyl α-C of the alcohol, the C alc α . Research, either genetic or computational, on stereo-recognition of primary alcohols, whose chiral center is not the C alc α , has been limited. These alcohols could only be resolved by a limited number of lipases including PcL [11,12]. Although by these lipases, only a small number of primary alcohols could be recognized, and even toward this small number of alcohols, the lipases’ enantiopreference did not obey Kazlauskas’ Rule [13–17]. In the present contribution, enantioselectivity by PcL toward 14 pairs of different chiral primary alcohol esters was investigated. The mechanism behind the deviant behavior of stereo-recognition of these substrates was studied by chemical modification of PcL, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulation. As a result, a new mechanism for enantioselectivity of lipase is proposed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PcL (Pseudomonas cepacia lipase in powder form, commercially Lipase PS) was purchased from Amano Enzyme Inc. Chiral primary alcohols including 2, 3, 3-trimethyl-1-butanol, 2-phenyl-1-propanol, 2-phenyl-1-butanol, 2-methoxymethyl-1-butanol, 2-methoxy-1-butanol and 2-phenoxy-1-propanol together with analytical samples of their optically pure enantiomers were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. Modification reagents, including CHD (1, 2-cyclohexanedione); DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate); EDA (ethylenediamine); EDC (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride); HNBB (2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide); IAA (iodoacetic acid); ICl (iodine monochloride); NAI (N-acetylimidazole); TNBS (2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid); TNM (tetranitromethane), were also purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. All other chemicals referred in this paper were of analytical grade."
3,Synthesis of substrates,"2.2 Synthesis of substrates Esters of chiral primary alcohols were synthesized from their corresponding alcohols. Alcohols and triethylamine (molar ratio=1:1.2) were mixed in an ice bath, and acetyl chloride was slowly added. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The end of reaction was determined by TLC (thin layer chromatography). The product was washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution several times, and residual water was removed by anhydrous sodium sulphite."
4,Resolution of primary alcohol esters,"2.3 Resolution of primary alcohol esters 10mL of a mixed solution of crude PcL powder (10mgmL−1), substrate (ester of chiral primary alcohol, 100mmolL−1) and PBS (phosphate buffer solution, 100mmolL−1, pH 7.0, including 10% V/V isopropanol as co-solvent) was added into a 20mL flask incubated at 27°C (300K) under 200rpm stirring. The reaction time was controlled as the conversion ratio was between 20 and 30%. The product was extracted by an equal volume of n-octanol. Substrates with aryl groups (2–7, 10–14) were analyzed by an Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with an Chiralpak AD-H column, whereas those without an aryl group (1, 8 and 9) were analyzed by an HP 1890 GC equipped with a Varian CP-Cyclodextrin-B-2, 3, 6-M-19 capillary GC column. The initial reaction rate= c·[Ester]0·V/Δt, where c is the conversion of the substrate, herein c should be less than 5%; [Ester]0 is the initial molar concentration of the substrate (100mmolL−1); V is the volume of the reactant (10mL); and Δt is the reaction time. The enantioselectivity ratio (E value) was calculated according to Chen et al. [18]: E =ln{1− c(1+ ee p)}/ln{1–c(1− ee p)}, where c is the conversion of the substrate; and ee p is the enantiomer excess, ee p =|[(S)-alcohol]−[(R)-alcohol]|/{[(S)-alcohol]+[(R)-alcohol]}×100%. In the formulas, the quantity in the square brackets denotes molar concentration."
5,Chemical modification of the lipase,"2.4 Chemical modification of the lipase The lipase powder adopted in the article was a semi-purified form and contains only PcL protein and some salts. Before modification, the powder was dissolved in deionized water, and added into a centrifuge tube (10mL) with ultrafiltration membrane (molecular weight cut off=10kDa), centrifuged at 12,000rpm at 4°C for 5min to remove the salts. The purified lipase was afterwards dissolved in buffer solutions for modification study. Arg (Arginine residue) was modified by CHD according to Patthy et al. [19]; Asp (aspartic acid residue), Glu (glutamic acid residue) and Lys (lysine residue) was modified by EDA, EDA and TNBS according to Barbosa et al. [20] and Geoghegan [21]; His (histidine residue) was modified by DEPC according to Miles et al. [22]; Met (methionine residue) was modified by IAA according to Gundlach et al. [23]; Trp (tryptophan residue) was modified by HNBB according to Hortan et al. [24]; Tyr (tyrosine residue) was modified by NAI, ICl and TNM according to Cacace et al. [25], Koshland et al. [26] and Riordan et al. [27]. All modification processes were carried out in an ice bath to avoid thermal inactivation. The modified PcL was desalted using an AKTA Prime protein purifier (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) equipped with a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The NAI-modified Tyr can be recovered by hydroxylamine: the reaction conditions were: 1mL of the desalted PcL was mixed with 30μL hydroxylamine (50% aqueous solution) and reacted for 1h. The resulting mixture was vacuum frozen for 12h. In addition to the standard reaction conditions of the chemical modification method referred to above, n-hexane was employed as an activator of PcL, because lipases are widely known to be activated at the aqueous-hydrophobic interface [28–30]. In the modification reaction coupled with activation, 10% (V/V) of n-hexane was added to the mixture under the same reaction condition."
6,Protein mass spectrum,"2.5 Protein mass spectrum Chemically modified PcL was isolated by SDS-PAGE according to Vandahl et al. [31]. The resulting denatured pure PcL was then digested by trypsin at 37°C overnight, according to Chen et al. [32]. The digested peptide slices were estimated by ExPASy PeptideMass (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_mass/). Finally, the sample was lyophilized using a Labconco FreeZone 18 freeze drier (Labconc Corporation, Kansas City, MO, USA) and afterwards dissolved in 20μL of acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1: 9, V/V) for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis according to Zehl et al. [33]. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix and ions were extracted into the linear UltraFleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Boston, MA, USA) using an extraction potential of 20kV in the high-mass detection mode according to Chang et al. [34]. Peptide mass fingerprinting data was also employed to search in NCBI non-redundant protein databases using the Mascot software (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA, USA)."
7,Simulation,"2.6 Simulation The XRD (X-ray distraction) crystalline structure of PcL (PDB ID: 2NW6) was used as a starting structure of the modeled lipase. The ligand ((phenoxymethyl)propyl methylphosphono-chloridoate, named POT in the file) and crystal water molecules (named HOH in the file) in the PDB file, were manually deleted in the Tripos SYBYL-X 1.1 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO, USA) workspace window. Then a pK a calculation for the titratable residues of the protein at pH 7 was performed using the online tool PCE [35]. Accordingly, the side-chain carboxyl groups of Asp2, Asp21, Asp36, Asp55, Asp56, Asp102, Asp121, Asp130, Asp159, Asp228, Asp236, Asp242, Asp264, Asp288, Asp303, Glu28, Glu35, Glu63, Glu118, Glu197, Glu289 and Glu302 were deprotonated and charged with −1.00; phenoxy oxygen atoms (O η ) of Tyr4, Tyr9, Tyr23, Tyr29, Tyr31, Tyr45, Tyr68, Tyr95, Tyr129, Tyr175, Tyr179, Tyr207, Tyr274 and Tyr282 were protonated; His15, His86, His114, His204 and His311 were set to the HIE state (each with a deprotonated N δ and a protonated N ɛ ); side-chain amino groups of Lys22, Lys70, Lys80, Lys165, Lys269, Lys283 and Lys316 and guanidyl groups of Arg8, Arg40, Arg61, Arg94, Arg115, Arg258, Arg297, Arg309, Arg314 were protonated and charged with +1.00; the N-terminal amino group was protonated and charged with +1.00 and the C-terminal carboxyl group was deprotonated and charged with −1.00. Additionally, the catalytic His286 was set to the HIP state (with both N δ and N ɛ protonated) with a charged state of +1.00, and the O γ of the catalytic Ser87 was deprotonated. The tetrahedral intermediates of the chiral primary alcohol esters’ enantiomers were generated by SYBYL-X. Starting with the resulting substrate structure and the enzyme structure prepared above, the substrate-enzyme complex in which acyloxy carbon atom of the tetrahedron covalently bonded to the catalytic group (deprotonated Ser87-O γ ) was elucidated by the covalent docking module FlexX of SYBYL-X according to Chen et al. [32] Molecular dynamic simulation procedures were performed by the AMBER 11 program [36] using the ff99SB force field. A TIP3P (transferable intermolecular potential 3P) [37,38] cubic periodic boundary water box was set up using a minimal distance 10Å between the box boundary and the protein. 22 Na+ and 16 Cl− ions were added to give a net charge of zero. Procedures of energy minimization, heating (from 0 to 300K) and density equilibrium were performed in turn. Subsequently, a 12.5ns dynamics simulation was performed at constant temperature (300K) and constant pressure (1bar) using a time step of 2fs. The trajectories and conformations of the system were recorded every 2ps. The first 2.5ns was for dynamics equilibration, and the remaining 10ns was taken for further interaction analysis. During the simulation, the pressure was controlled using the Berendsen algorithm [39]. SHAKE algorithm [40] was applied to all bonds. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald [41] method with a non-bonded cutoff of 12Å."
8,Results,
9,Resolution of primary alcohol esters,"3.1 Resolution of primary alcohol esters PcL-catalyzed resolution of 14 pairs of different chiral primary alcohols via hydrolysis of their corresponding esters was investigated (Table 1 ). The results indicate that the enantioselectivity was not related to the difference between groups directly connected to the chiral center of the substrate, and there was no (R)-preference commonly observed in lipase resolution of secondary alcohols either. What should be mentioned is, according to 8–14 vs. 1–7 in Table 1, enantioselectivity of PcL toward primary alcohol esters with Onon-α (oxygen atom at non-α-position of the acyloxy group) was far better than those without. Besides, according to 10–14 in Table 1, as the acyl moiety of the substrate increased in size (2–6, 10–14), the initial reaction rates decreased accordingly. This tendency is consistent with many studies before. However, the enantioselectivity decreased while acyl moiety growing, which is opposite to that observed for secondary alcohols. Substrate 10 and 2 were taken as model substrates for further investigation because they have similar structures yet large differences in the enantioselectivity."
10,Chemical modification of PcL,"3.2 Chemical modification of PcL To define regions related to the enantioselectivity toward 10 and 2, PcL was treated with 10 different common protein modifiers respectively (Table 2 ). It is widely accepted that hydrophobic environment induces the exposing of lipase's cavity of catalytic center by removing the α-helix covering it [23]. Therefore during the modification process, n-hexane was adopted as an activator of PcL to modify residues inside the catalytic cavity normally isolated from the outer solvent environment. In the absence of n-hexane, almost none of the modifiers influenced the enantioselectivity of PcL toward either 10 or 2. In contrast, in the presence of n-hexane, enantioselectivity toward 2 remained hardly affected by any modification, but enantioselectivity toward 10 was affected significantly by modifications targeting tyrosine residues. ICl and TNM (by ortho-substitution of the phenolic hydroxyl group) increased PcL's enantioselectivity toward 10 from 33 to 36 and 42 respectively. NAI (by acetylating the phenolic hydroxyl group) decreased the value to 9, which is less than a third of that of native PcL. MALDI-TOF-MS of the NAI-modified PcL in the presence of n-hexane (Table 3 ) showed that the only tyrosine residue in the catalytic cavity of PcL, Tyr29, was actually acetylated. Hydroxylamine treatment of NAI-modified PcL restored the modified Tyr to a free phenolic hydroxyl hydrogen, and the enantioselectivity was recovered (Fig. 1 )."
11,Molecular dynamics simulations,"3.3 Molecular dynamics simulations The complexes of PcL and the substrates were simulated using molecular dynamics (MD) computing. According to the resulting conformations generated by 10ns of MD, O γ of (S)-8, 9 and 10 (which were the preferred enantiomers according to Table 1) formed a hydrogen bond with Tyr29-O η H (Fig. 2 row 3, column 1–3), but (R)-enantiomers did not (Fig. 2 row 4, column 1–3). Both (R)- and (S)-10 enantiomers did not form a hydrogen bond with acetylated-Tyr29-O η of NAI-modified PcL (Fig. 2 row 3 and 4, column 4). Determination of the {PcL-Tyr29-O η -H⋯Onon-α -substrate} distance (Table 4 ) showed that only in the case of (S)-8, 9 and 10 +native PcL, was the {PcL-Tyr29-O η -H⋯Onon-α -substrate} distance in the acceptable range to form a hydrogen bond (2.7∼3.7Å). In all other cases ((R)- or (S)-1, 2 and 7 +native PcL, (R)-8, 9 and 10 +native PcL, (R)- or (S)-8, 9 and 10 +Tyr29-O η -acetylated PcL) the distance was too large to form a hydrogen bond."
12,Discussion,"The deviant behaviors from both alcohol and acyl moiety of the primary alcohol ester indicated that stereo-recognition by PcL for these type of substrates is decided by some non-Kazlauskas’ shape-determined interaction between the Onon-α of the substrate and certain structure features of the lipase, and the growing of substrate's acyl moiety made a negative effort to such an interaction. Modification of PcL (Table 3) suggested that, the weakening of Tyr29 ability as a hydrogen donor (via NAI modification) decreased the enantioselectivity toward 10, while strengthening the hydrogen donor capability of Tyr29 (via ICl or TNM modification) increased the enantioselectivity toward 10. However, these modifications had negligible effect on enantioselectivity toward 2. The only structural difference between 10 and 2 is the Onon-α , which is also very important to the enantioselectivity of native PcL toward primary alcohol esters (see entries 8–14 vs. entries 1–7 in Table 1). The significance of the presence of this Onon-α in chiral primary alcohol substrates, together with the influence by Tyr29's ability as a hydrogen donor was sufficient to infer that a hydrogen bond between Tyr29-OH and the Onon-α of the substrate enantiomer would aid significantly the stereo-recognition by PcL toward the primary alcohol ester. This indication was strongly supported by the MD simulation (Fig. 2 and Table 4), which showed that only the PcL preferred enantiomers ((S)-conformation) of 8, 9 and 10 were able to form such a hydrogen bond with Tyr29 (Fig. 2 row 3, columns 1–3, and Table 4 entries 5–7, column (S)). In contrast, the non-preferred (R)-8, 9 and 10 did not form any hydrogen bond with Tyr29 (Fig. 2 row 4, column 1, 2 and 3, and Table 4 entries 5–7, column (R)). Moreover, as enantiomers of 1, 2 and 7 lack the Onon-α to form a hydrogen bond with Tyr29-OH, PcL could not distinguish these pairs of primary alcohol esters and had poor enantioselectivity toward them. One more thing left to discuss is the influence of the acyl moiety of the substrate on enantioselectivity. Since we have mentioned above that PcL-Tyr29-OH and the Onon-α of the primary alcohol ester to a great extent decided the enantioselectivity, we postulate that increasing the length of the acyl moiety negatively effects to the formation of the {PcL-Tyr29-O η -H⋯Onon-α -substrate} hydrogen bond. As shown in Fig. 3a, in order to determine this “negative effect” quantitatively by MD simulations, the preferred enantiomer of chiral primary alcohol esters with Onon-α and different acyl moiety lengths ((S)-10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, respectively with C2, C4, C6, C8 and C12 acyl chain lengths) were respectively docked into the catalytic center of PcL. The resulting conformation of the substrate-enzyme complexes were simulated using MD, during which the {PcL-Tyr29-O η -H⋯Onon-α -substrate} distance was manually restricted to 2.7–3.7Å so as to form the hydrogen bond. Because the selected long acyl chain substrates would not readily form a hydrogen bond with Tyr29, the manual restriction was hypothesized to cause unreasonable structure of the simulated substrate-enzyme complex, and therefore there must be correlation between the unreasonability feature and the enantioselectivity. The MD result did match the hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 3b, the { C acyl 1 -O alc - C alc α - C alc β } dihedral displayed a clear consistent correlation to the enantioselectivity ratio, confirming that the chiral primary alcohol ester with a larger acyl moiety suffered stronger steric hindrance from the acyl side of the PcL catalytic cavity, thereby pushing the Onon-α further away from Tyr29-OH and thus decreasing the enantioselectivity."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, PcL stereo-recognition of chiral primary alcohols (and their esters) is mostly decided by the possibility and extent of the formation of a hydrogen bond between the Onon-α of the substrates and the Tyr29-OH of the lipase. Moreover, a larger acyl moiety was found to push the Onon-α further away from Tyr29-OH, thereby reducing the likelihood of this key hydrogen bond, and thus decreasing the enantioselectivity. This mechanism rather satisfactorily explains the lipase's deviant behavior of stereo-recognition of chiral primary alcohols which does not follow the former empirical rules and laws for secondary alcohols."
