0,Introduction,"The production of palm oil as one of the major edible oils consumed in the world has increased tremendously in the last decade and is led by Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand [1]. However, the milling process produces a huge volume of palm oil mill effluent (POME). Disposal of these wastes is already an economic burden on communities and industries, so creating a marketable product from these wastes would reduce the treatment cost. Recovery of energy from waste might reduce the cost of wastewater treatment, and contribute to reducing our dependence on fossil fuel. Hydrogen and energy production could mitigate these problems. Hydrogen production by microorganisms can be divided into two main categories: one involves the use of photosynthetic bacteria and algae under light conditions and the other, anaerobic fermentative bacteria under dark conditions. Dark fermentative production of hydrogen can convert often negative valued organic wastes into hydrogen-rich gas [2–4]. In addition, the major advantages of fermentative processes are rapid bacterial growth rates, relatively high hydrogen production capacities, operation without light sources and no oxygen limitation problems. At least at small-scale production ( 100 – 1000 l H 2 / h ) , these characteristics make it more competitive and economic than thermal and chemical conversion of fossil fuels into hydrogen gas [5,6]. The process is relatively low cost and effective, has low energy demands and generates minimal pollution [7]. Thus, hydrogen energy produced directly from renewable biomass and water by fermentative bacteria has a considerable potential for widespread use in the future. Raw POME is an acidic brownish colloidal suspension consisting of 86–90% water, 0.8–1.1% oil, 1.5 – 2.6 mg Fe 2 + / l , 3.5–4.2% total solids including 0.85–1.2% suspended solids with high organic content ( 75 – 96 g COD / l ) and high temperature ( 70 – 80 ∘ C ) [8,9]. Shin and co-workers [10] reported that low pH and high temperature conditions provide the best yields of hydrogen from food wastes. Atif et al. [11] used microflora isolated from sludge taken from an anaerobic POME wastewater treatment pond to produce hydrogen from POME under thermophilic conditions. These batch experiments showed a total yield of 4.7 l H 2 / l - POME with a maximum evolution rate of 0.45 l H 2 / l - POME / h . Mixed microflora from cow dung using an anaerobic contact filter system under mesophilic conditions has also been used to produce hydrogen from POME, achieving both hydrogen production ( 0.42 l H 2 / g COD destroyed) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction (40%) [12]. It has furthermore been demonstrated that thermophilic hydrogen production gave a higher reaction rate, better process performance from the perspective of energy recovery and decreased contamination by hydrogen consumers than mesophilic hydrogen production [10]. Investigations confirmed that certain Thermoanaerobacterium species have ability to produce hydrogen under thermophilic conditions [13–15]. The optimization of hydrogen fermentation, particularly nutritional and environmental parameters are important for process development. It is laborious and time-consuming to perform this operation using conventional techniques such as a one-factor-at-a-time method [16]. Moreover, this does not depict the interactive effects among the tested variables and guarantee the determination of optimal conditions. In contrast, the statistically based experimental design is a time saving method, which minimizes the error in determining the effects of parameters [17]. Statistical optimization methods have been successfully employed for optimization of several bioprocesses [18]. Recently, the statistical optimization design on hydrogen production has been reported. For instance, Fan et al. [19] investigated the effects of initial pH, substrate concentration on biohydrogen production by enriched microflora using response surface methodology. Lay et al. [20] investigated factors affecting hydrogen production from food wastes by Clostridium-rich composts using central composite design and factorial design. Although many studies on the effect of variations in culture parameters such as pH, concentration of iron, nitrogen and substrate, as well as other nutritional factors on hydrogen production by anaerobic bacteria, almost all of them were carried out at mesophilic conditions and dominated by Clostridium species [21–24]. There are so far no reports available for optimization of this process by Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge using statistical optimization methods. Fermentative hydrogen production depends on factors such as seed microorganisms, carbon source, nitrogen source, phosphorus source, pH and temperature. The optimum pH (5.5) and temperature ( 60 ∘ C ) for hydrogen production from POME using Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge was determined in a previous work [25]. POME is deficient in the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and additions of these elements are crucial for bacterial growth and subsequent hydrogen production. The present investigation aimed at understanding the effects of iron concentration, and C/N and C/P ratios in POME on simultaneous hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency by Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge under thermophilic conditions. The central composite design using response surface methodology was employed in order to investigate these effects and improve the hydrogen yield."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Anaerobic seed sludge,"2.1 Anaerobic seed sludge The anaerobic seed sludge used in this experiment was obtained from a lab-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) producing hydrogen from raw POME. The seed microflora for hydrogen production was collected from a palm oil mill wastewater treatment plant. The sludge was enriched with synthetic medium according to Fan et al. [19] with initial pH adjusted to 5.5 and operated under thermophilic condition ( 60 ∘ C ) to remove methanogenic bioactivity. The enriched sludge having a volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of 2.0g/l was gradually acclimatized with POME by successive transfer to increasing concentration of POME (10%, 30%, 60% and 100%). Then, the sludge was seeded into an ASBR for continuous operation. ASBR was operated at a 4-day hydraulic retention time, maintaining pH at 5.5 and temperature at 60 ∘ C . Sludge from this reactor was analyzed by DGGE and found to be dominated by Thermoanaerobacterium spp. The seed sludge was first centrifuged at 5000 × g for 1min, resuspended in raw POME, and then used as inoculum for the study of the effects of changing iron concentration, and C/N and C/P ratios in batch experiment."
3,Palm oil mill effluent (POME),"2.2 Palm oil mill effluent (POME) Raw POME was collected from the receiving tank of Trang Palm Oil Co, Ltd. in Southern Thailand. Raw POME has brown color, pH 4.2–4.5, a temperature of 70 – 80 ∘ C and a water content of 86–90%. The chemical characteristics of the POME are given in Table 1 . The POME was kept at 0 – 4 ∘ C until used."
4,Experimental design and data analysis,"2.3 Experimental design and data analysis The experiment was performed in 150ml serum bottles containing 60ml POME, where 5ml resuspended anaerobic seed sludge inoculum, 0.15 g NaHCO 3 and various amounts of iron, nitrogen and phosphate were added. The concentration of iron ( Fe 2 + ) ranged from 2 to 400mg/l, the C/N and C/P ratios from 45 to 95 using peptone as a nitrogen source and 450–650 using Na 2 HPO 4 · 2 H 2 O , respectively. C/N ratio and C/P ratio were calculated from total chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The 48 serum bottles were incubated at 60 ∘ C with an initial pH of 5.5 adjusted with 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl . The evolved gas was collected every 3h with a gas-collecting bag (Cali-5-bond, Calibrated Instruments, Inc.) and measured by the water displacement method using a graduated cylinder filled with acidic water ( ⩽ pH 3), in order to prevent dissolution of the gas components [26]. The microbial diversity of sludge samples was analyzed by DGGE. A confirmation experiment was carried out in 250ml serum bottles containing 120ml POME, where 10ml resuspended anaerobic seed sludge inoculum, 0.3 g NaHCO 3 and optimal concentrations of iron, nitrogen and phosphate were added. A factorial central composite experimental design was used to study the effect of the iron concentration and the C/N and C/P ratios on simultaneous hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency. The cumulative hydrogen production curves were obtained over the time course of a batch experiment. A total of 20 runs, performed in triplicates, were performed. Table 2 lists the actual ( X i ) levels of each variable. For statistical calculation, the test factors ( X i ) were coded as x i according to the following transformation equation: (1) x i = ( X i - X 0 ) / Δ X i , where x i is the coded value of the variable X i , X i = the actual value of the i th independent variable, X 0 = the actual value of X i at the center point and Δ X i = step change value. A quadratic model [27] was used to evaluate the optimization of environmental factors: (2) Y i = β 0 + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 + β 3 x 3 + β 12 x 1 x 2 + β 13 x 1 x 3 + β 23 x 2 x 3 + β 11 x 1 2 + β 22 x 2 2 + β 33 x 3 2 , where Y i is the predicted response; x 1 , x 2 and x 3 the parameters; β 0 the offset term; β 1 , β 2 and β 3 the linear coefficients; β 11 , β 22 and β 33 the squared coefficients; and β 12 , β 23 and β 13 the interaction coefficients. The response variable ( Y H 2 and Y COD ) was fitted using a predictive polynomial quadratic equation (1) in order to correlate the response variable to the independent variables [28]. The Y H 2 and Y COD values were regressed with respect to iron concentration and the C/N and C/P ratios. The Satistica (Statsoft, USA) and Design expert software version 6.0 (Stat-Ease. Inc., MN, USA) were used for regression and graphical analysis of the experimental data. The optimum levels of the selected variables were obtained by solving the regression equation and by analyzing the response surface contour and surface plots. The quality of the fit of quadratic model was expressed by the coefficient of determination R 2 , and its statical significance was checked by the F -test in the same program."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The biogas composition was measured by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard GC 6890 equipped with thermal conductivity detectors, TCD). Hydrogen gas was analyzed by GC-TCD fitted with a 1.5m stainless steel column SS350A packed with a molecular sieve (80/100mesh). Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The temperatures of the injection port, oven and detector were 100, 50 and 100 ∘ C , respectively [29]. Methane and carbon dioxide were analyzed by GC-TCD fitted with a 1.0m stainless steel column packed with Porapak T (60/80mesh). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 35ml/min. The temperatures of the injection port, oven and detector were at 150, 50 and 100 ∘ C , respectively [30]. The gas sample of 100 μ l for methane and 500 μ l for hydrogen was injected in duplicate. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard, HP 6850) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). A column capillary packed with nitroterephthalic acid-modified polyethleneglycol (DB-FFAP) and with a length of 30m was used. The temperature of the injection port was 250 ∘ C . The chromatography was performed using the following program: 100 ∘ C for 5min, 100 – 250 ∘ C with a ramping of 10 ∘ C / min , 250 ∘ C for 12min. The detector temperature was 300 ∘ C . COD, pH, suspended solid (SS), volatile suspended solid (VSS), biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD 5 ) , oil concentration, total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were determined in accordance with the procedures described in the Standard Methods [31]. Ammonium-nitrogen and phosphate concentrations were analyzed using commercial test kits from Spectroquant (Merck Ltd., Germany). The total carbohydrate content was analyzed by the anthrone method [32]."
6,Microbial community analysis,"2.5 Microbial community analysis Total genomic DNA was extracted from samples collected from batch cultures using raw POME and from cultures grown in optimized medium using the Ultraclean Soil DNA Kit (MoBio Laboratory Inc., USA). The region of the 16S rRNA genes corresponding to position 340–518 in the 16S rRNA of Escherichia coli was PCR-amplified using the forward primer; L340GCf ( 5 ′ -CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG- 3 ′ ) with a GC clamp at the 5 ′ end and the reverse primer; K517r ( 5 ′ -ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG- 3 ′ ) [33]. PCR amplification was conducted in an automated thermal cycler using the following protocol: initial denaturation for 5min at 94 ∘ C , 30 cycles of denaturation for 1min at 95 ∘ C , annealing for 30s at 55 ∘ C , extension for 1min at 72 ∘ C , followed by a final extension for 7min at 72 ∘ C . The DGGE analysis of the PCR products was performed by electrophoresis for 20min at 20V and 15h at 70V through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing a linear gradient of denaturant (100% denaturant corresponds to 7M urea and 40% (v/v) formamide deionized with AG501-X8 mixed bed resin) ranging from 30% to 60% in 0.5 × TAE buffer at a constant temperature of 60 ∘ C (DGGE unit, V20-HCDC, Scie-Plas Limited, UK) The gel was stained with Sybr-Gold ( 1000 × concentration) for 1h and visualized on a UV transilluminator. Most of the bands were excised from the gel and re-amplified with the forward primer without a GC clamp and the reverse primer. After re-amplification, PCR products were purified using E.Z.N.A cycle pure kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) and sequenced using primer K517r and an ABI PRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified by database searches in GenBank using BLAST [34]. The nucleotide sequences of the six sequenced bands from the DGGE gels are available in the GenBank database under the accession numbers AM396262-AM396267."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Effects of iron concentration, C/N ratio and C/P ratio on hydrogen production","3.1 Effects of iron concentration, C/N ratio and C/P ratio on hydrogen production The present study aimed at understanding of the effects of important process variables for fermentative hydrogen production from POME, and was partly based on previous knowledge obtained by Lin and Lay [35], Lay et al. [20] and Zhang et al. [24]. The hydrogen production ranged from 3.8 to 6.7 l H 2 / l - POME (Table 2). Low hydrogen production ( 4.2 l H 2 / l - POME ) was obtained using raw POME (Table 2, trial 16, control). Low C/N and C/P ratio (Table 2, trial 4) did not improve hydrogen production. A maximal hydrogen production ( 6.7 l H 2 / l - POME ) was obtained using moderate additions of iron, nitrogen and phosphate (trial 20). To evaluate the results, the data in Table 2 were subjected to regression analysis, using the following quadratic equation: (3) Y H 2 = 6509.28 + 298.18 X 1 + 416.24 X 2 - 106.12 X 3 + 159.75 X 1 X 2 - 29 X 1 X 3 - 72.25 X 2 X 3 - 1560.34 X 1 2 - 1070.34 X 2 2 + 569.66 X 3 2 , where Y H 2 is the hydrogen production response and X 1 , X 2 and X 3 are the coded values of iron concentration, C/N ratio and C/P ratio, respectively. The model presented a high determination coefficient ( R 2 = 0.98 ) explaining 98% of variability in the response. The value of the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R 2 = 0.93 ) is also very high, indicating a high significance of the model [36]. The ANOVA quadratic regression model demonstrated that the model was highly significant, as was evident from the Fisher's F -test with a very low probability ( P < 0.0001 ) and lack of fit model was not significant ( P = 0.09 ) . At the same time, a lower variation coefficient value ( CV = 3.42 % ) indicated a high precision and reliability of the experiments. Furthermore, the optimum conditions for maximizing hydrogen production yield, calculated by setting the partial derivatives of Eq. (3) to zero with respect to the corresponding variables, were an iron concentration of 199mg/l, a C/N ratio of 74 and a C/P ratio of 451. The maximum response values for hydrogen production yield were estimated as 7.2 l H 2 / l - POME . The three dimensional and contour plots are based on Eq. (3) with one variable kept constant at its optimum level, and varying the other two variables within the experimental range (Fig. 1 ). The main goal of response surface analysis is to unravel the optimum combination of variables in order to maximize the response. As shown in Fig. 1, the response surface of hydrogen production indicated that the optimum conditions fell inside the design boundary well. These results showed that iron concentration and C/N ratio had significant interactive influence on hydrogen production, but phosphate had no interactive effect. However, C/N ratio, C/P ratio and iron concentration all had an individual significant influence on hydrogen production.The significance of each coefficient was determined by probability values which are listed in Table 3 . It is obvious that the variables with a significant effect on hydrogen production was the term of iron concentration ( X 1 ) and C/N ratio ( X 2 ) ( P < 0.05 ) . It also shows that linear ( X 1 , X 2 , X 1 2 , X 2 2 ) and quadratic ( X 1 X 2 ) terms of iron concentration and C/N ratio are significant ( P < 0.05 ) , demonstrating that the microorganisms responsible for hydrogen production required both a supplementary nitrogen source and a suitable iron concentration for maximal hydrogen fermentation. Biological hydrogen production depends on the activity of hydrogenases, which are iron-containing enzymes directly responsible for hydrogen formation. Dabrock et al. [37] demonstrated that the in vivo activity of hydrogenase in fermentative bacteria decreased with iron depletion. The importance of iron in this process has also been reported for hydrogen production by Clostridium-rich composts [20] and mixed anaerobic microflora [24]. The importance of nitrogen source has been reported for hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum KU001 [38], but the effect of combination of nitrogen source and iron concentration on thermophilic hydrogen production has not been reported previously. Phosphate is also an important inorganic nutrient required for optimal hydrogen production [7]. The individual effect of phosphate on hydrogen production was reported by Lin and Lay [39], who found that the hydrogen production peaked when the Na 2 HPO 4 concentration in medium was 600mg/l."
9,"Effects of iron concentration, C/N ratio and C/P ratio on % COD removal","3.2 Effects of iron concentration, C/N ratio and C/P ratio on % COD removal The COD removal efficiencies ranged from 20.8 to 63% (Table 2). Lowest COD removal efficiencies (20.8–21.4%) were obtained using low C/N and C/P ratio (Table 2, trial 4) and only low C/N ratio (Table 2, trial 13), suggesting that COD removal is not limited by the lack of nitrogen and phosphorus. The COD removal of raw POME cultivation were 37.8% (Table 2, trial 16). High COD removal efficiencies (57–63%) were obtained in trials 1, 3, 7, 17, 19 and 20, i.e. under conditions that also stimulated hydrogen production. COD removal could be increased by 60% as compared with raw POME cultivation. As for hydrogen production, response surface analysis was performed for evaluating the effects of the variables on % COD removal and the regression coefficient and significant levels of the term are also given in Table 3. The quadratic equation (Eq. (4)) presented a high determination coefficient ( R 2 = 0.96 ) and the value of the adjusted determination coefficient (adjusted R 2 = 0.93 ). The ANOVA of quadratic regression model demonstrated that the model was highly significant, as was evident from the Fisher's F -test with a very low probability ( P < 0.0001 ) . (4) Y COD = 56.17 + 0.32 X 1 + 4.95 X 2 + 3.2 X 3 + 16.15 X 1 2 - 27.85 X 2 2 - 18.25 X 3 2 + 0.45 X 1 X 2 - 0.28 X 1 X 3 + 3.25 X 2 X 3 . At the same time, a relatively low variation coefficient value ( CV = 9.22 % ) was obtained. The optimum conditions for maximizing % COD removal, calculated by setting the partial derivatives of Eq. (4) to zero with respect to the corresponding variables were iron concentration of 100mg/l, C/N ratio of 72 and C/P ratio of 565. The maximum response value for COD removal was estimated to be 60.7%. The three-dimensional and contour plots are based on Eq. (4) with one variable kept constant at its optimum level, and varying the other two variables within the experimental range. As shown in Fig. 2 , the response surface of % COD removal indicated that the C/P and C/N ratios had significant interactive influence on COD removal efficiency but varying the iron concentrations had no interactive effect. However, C/N ratio, C/P ratio and iron concentration all had an individual significant influence on COD removal efficiency. Generally, COD removal efficiencies in fermentative hydrogen production processes are 20–40%. COD reduction of 30% has been obtained from molasses [40] and 40% previously from POME [12]. COD removal in the latter study was improved after supplementing the wastewater with nutrients (N, P and Fe). This confirms that POME is deficient in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. In general thermophilic bacteria in the Thermoanaerobacterium group require high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations [41,42]. However, effluents of fermentative hydrogen production still need further treatment before being discharged to the environment. It might be possible to produce hydrogen at the first stage of anaerobic treatment of POME, leaving the remaining fermentation products such as acetate and butyrate for further methane production or hydrogen production using photofermentation in a two-stage process."
10,Confirmation experiment,"3.3 Confirmation experiment The main results from our experiments revealed that maximum simultaneous hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency were obtained at an iron concentration of 257mg/l, a C/N ratio of 74 and a C/P ratio of 559. Under this condition, the model predicted a production of 6.5 l H 2 / l - POME and a COD removal efficiency of 57.8%. To confirm the validation of the statistical experiments and to improve the understanding of simultaneous hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency, three replicates of batch experiments were performed under optimal conditions. The results are summarized in Table 4 and are in close agreement with the predicted values, with hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency of 6.33 ± 0.142 l H 2 / l - POME and 55 ± 1.5 % , respectively. The total carbohydrate conversion was 92 ± 2.7 % . The hydrogen production using raw POME (Table 4, trial 16) and adjusted POME (Table 4, trial 1) were found to be 0.25 l H 2 / g COD removed and 0.13 l H 2 / g COD removed , respectively, with a hydrogen volume of 4.2 ± 0.02 and 6.7 ± 0.03 l H 2 / l - POME , respectively. According to the stoichiometry, each gram of carbohydrate produces a maximum of 553ml hydrogen with acetate as a by-product [6]. In our experiments the hydrogen yield increased from 40% to 66% of the maximum theoretical value when POME was adjusted to optimal conditions. This hydrogen production yield was higher than those of previous reports; 4.78 l H 2 / l - POME [11] and 4 – 5 l H 2 / l - POME [43]. A comparison of hydrogen production yield and COD reduction efficiency of various types of organic wastes including POME and POME where the C/N ratio, C/P ratio and Fe 2 + concentration were adjusted to optimum values are given in Table 5 . The development of hydrogen during the fermentation process is summarized in Fig. 3 A. A 3h lag phase before onset of hydrogen production was observed. No methane could be detected. Fig. 3B illustrates the formation of VFAs and alcohols accompanied by the production of hydrogen. After a lag phase, the concentration of VFAs and alcohols increased sharply. Under optimized condition, the biogas produced contained 58–60% hydrogen and the major submerged fermentation products were butyric acid (6.2g/l), acetic acid (4.3g/l) and propionate (0.12g/l) with a small amount of ethanol and lactate. The hydrogen production was accompanied with the production of VFA and alcohols. Butyric acid and acetic acid constituted more than 70% of total metabolites. In general, production of these two acids favors the production of hydrogen, according to Eqs. (5) and (6) [44]. Theoretically, four moles of hydrogen are produced from glucose concomitantly with 2mol of acetate: (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + 2 C 2 H 4 O 2 , with only 2mol of hydrogen produced when butyrate is the main fermentation product: (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 + C 4 H 8 O 2 . If the values obtained for acetate and butyrate in the present experiment are substituted into Eqs. (5) and (6), then the estimated value for hydrogen production is in good agreement with the actual values obtained under the optimum conditions. Only low amounts of propionic acid and lactic acid were produced in our study. This may have contributed to the high hydrogen yield as both of these acids are known to disfavor hydrogen production [7,15]. The results showed that cultural parameters had significant effect on the conversion of POME into hydrogen. Despite its complexity, relative resistance to biodegradation and deficiency in the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, POME was found to be a good substrate for hydrogen production. By addition of suitable amounts of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus, the hydrogen production yield can be increased."
11,Microbial community analysis,"3.4 Microbial community analysis The microbial diversity of the sludge from the raw POME cultivation and optimized medium cultivation was analyzed by DGGE. By the use of DGGE, a Thermoanaerobacterium sp. was identified as the most dominant organism, sharing 97% 16S rRNA sequence identity with T. thermosaccharolyticum (Fig. 4 ). According to the intensity of this band this bacterium has a higher population density under optimal conditions than in raw POME. This indicates that the optimal conditions favor the growth of this organism and that it might play an important role in the conversion of the carbohydrate- and fat-rich substrate to hydrogen. There have been many reports indicating that Thermoanaerobacterium spp. possess the capability to utilize complex carbohydrate such as starch, xylan, cracked corn, cellulose and simple sugar accompanied with hydrogen and acid production [41–45]. Several species of Thermoanaerobacterium are known for their hydrogen production characteristics, including T. thermosaccharolyticum, T. polysaccharolyticum, T. zeae, T. lactoethylicum and T. aotearoense. All these organisms have optimal growth conditions at 55 – 70 ∘ C and at pH 5.2–7.8 [6]. Two additional weak bands, probably representing other Thermoanaerobacterium strains were also found. Hydrogen-consuming microorganisms were not detected by DGGE under this condition. Other microorganisms that were detected include a Clostridium sp. a Desulfotomaculum sp., and a bacterium sharing high similarity with a Bacillus sp. Desulfotomaculum is a thermophilic, fatty acid-degrading, genus of sulfate-reducers and has been found to participate in hydrogen production in food-waste fermentations [10]. A co-metabolism of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. and Desulfotomaculum sp. could be the reason for maximum simultaneous hydrogen production and COD removal from POME under optimum condition. The major submerged fermentation products were butyrate ( 38 ± 3.3 % ) , acetate ( 16 ± 1.2 % ) , ethanol ( 12 ± 2.7 % ) , lactate ( 2.7 ± 0.9 % ) and propionate ( 0.6 ± 0.1 % ) . The low amount of lactate produced using the Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge under optimal conditions is surprising, as Thermoanaerobacterium spp. are able to produce lactate by fermenting glucose [15,39]. This is, however, an advantage for the development of hydrogen, as the lactate formation pathway does not lead to hydrogen production [7]. Of the variable factors tested in this study, nitrogen and phosphate are the nutrients for the growth of Thermoanaerobacterium species, while iron exerts a synergistic influence in the conversion of POME to hydrogen. Therefore, the use of Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge is promising for future engineering practice of biohydrogen production from POME."
12,Conclusion,"C/N ratio and iron concentration has a significant interactive effect on the hydrogen production ability of the Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge. By adjusting raw POME to a proper C/N, C/P and iron concentration, the hydrogen production rate can be increased by 60% as compared with raw POME. C/N and C/P ratios gave more profound interactive effect on COD removal. The response surface methodology (RSM) results indicated that the presence of 257 mg Fe 2 + / l , a C/N ratio of 74, a C/P ratio of 559 were optimal for simultaneous hydrogen production and COD removal and gave a predicted maximum hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency of 6.5 l H 2 / l - POME and 58%, respectively. The RSM with central composite design was useful for optimizing the biohydrogen producing process and the predicted values under optimized conditions were highly reproducible. The present study provides valuable information about the optimization of the medium composition favoring the growth of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. Addition of macronutrients and iron enhanced both hydrogen production and COD removal efficiency, and thus, improved simultaneous biohydrogen production and pollution reduction from POME with Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge."
