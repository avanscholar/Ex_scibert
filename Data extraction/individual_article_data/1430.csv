0,Introduction,"At present, the energy crisis and environmental pollution have become global problems, which have become obstacles to the sustainable development of countries around the world [1–3]. Recently, the rapid development of photocatalytic technologies, such as organic dyes degradation, photocatalytic H2 or O2 generation through water splitting, CO2 conversion and N2 fixation, has been recognized as one of the most attractive methods to alleviate the energy and environmental issues, because the solar energy is inexhaustible and easily accessible worldwide [4–6]. Among them, photocatalytic H2 generation through water splitting represents a very attractive pathway for converting solar energy to chemical energy [7]. Since Fujishima and Honda realized photoelectric catalytic hydrogen production through water splitting firstly in 1972, the development and research of photocatalytic materials have always been a research hotspot for researchers [8,9]. For more than 40 years, a variety of photocatalytic materials have been developed that can be used in photocatalytic processes. Most of the photocatalytic materials are inorganic compound semiconductors, such as metal nitrides, metal oxides, metal phosphides, metal sulfides and so on [10,11]. With the further research, when these semiconductors act as a single catalyst, the low separation rate and high recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers, narrow light response range and insufficient surface reaction sites result in the low H2 generation rate [12]. Consequently, researchers have conducted lots of studies on these problems, such as building heterojunction, noble metal deposition, organic–inorganic composites, introducing defects, element doping, etc [13–17]. Among these methods, constructing heterojunction can enhance the separation rate of photogenerated carriers and reduce their recombination efficiency, leading to the efficient photocatalytic activity [18]. According to the arrangement of semiconductors energy bands, conventional heterojunctions could be divided into I-type (crossover arrangement), II-type (staggered arrangement) and III-type (interrupted arrangement) [19]. Among these types, the II-type heterostructure is the most widely used in the field of photocatalysis technology. Usually, the role of the II-type heterostructure (containing semiconductor 1 (SC 1) and semiconductor 2 (SC 2)) is to transfer photoexcited electrons from high conduction band (CB) of SC 2 to low CB of SC 1 (Scheme 1 a), which can accelerate the separation of photoexcited carriers [20]. However, the electron-transfer is limited by the coulomb repulsions among photogenerated electrons [21]. Recently, an artificial vector Z-scheme system has attracted widespread attentions, which is an effective construction to boost the catalytic activities of photocatalysts [22]. Compared to the II-type heterostructure, an electron mediator (EM) is added between SC 1 and SC 2 of vector Z-scheme system (Scheme 1b) [23]. Noble metal (Au/Ag/Rh/Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene can be used as EM, which can effectively accelerate electron transfer process in the vector Z-scheme system, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic activity [24]. Moreover, the photoexcited electrons (stronger reduction ability) in SC 2 with a high CB and holes (stronger oxidation ability) in SC 1 with a low valence band (VB) can be retained [25]. For example, through surface modification, Domen group found that the solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of Ru-modified SrTiO3: La, Rh/Au/BiVO4: Mo sheet was up to 1.1% through pure water (pH 6.8) splitting [8]. Yang et al. found the 18% CdS/2%Pt/N-NaNbO3 nanorods exhibited a remarkably improved hydrogen production rate, which is 28-fold and 134-fold higher than that of CdS QDs and bare NaNbO3 nanorods under visible light, respectively [23]. However, the high cost of noble metals as EM restricted their applications. Therefore, it still is important and imperative for researchers to look for cheap and stable non-noble metals to construct new vector Z-scheme systems, which could offer a good deal of opportunities for studying the relationship between the observed complex phenomena and theories of photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting [26,27]. As one of the most common perovskite composite oxide (ABO3), CaTiO3 represents great potential applications in the energy utilization and environmental protection fields because of its characteristic crystal structure, stable photo-electrochemistry performance, and good photo-electrocatalysis activity [28,29]. Meanwhile, anatase TiO2 as one of the most important functional metal oxides has been investigated in wide application fields of catalysis and photoelectrochemistry for its good stability, non-toxicity, low cost and corrosion resistance [30,31]. For the staggered CB and VB positions, CaTiO3 and TiO2 can form II-type semiconductor heterostructure [32]. Therefore, a strong built-in electronic field (BIEF) effect could form between CaTiO3 and TiO2 heterostructure, which can increase the separation efficiency and transfer rate of photoexcited carriers, and enhance the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation [33]. Moreover, TiO2 and CaTiO3 have good lattice matching for the similar length of the Ti-O bonds (CaTiO3: 1.958 Å, TiO2: 1.976 Å), which is good for strengthening their interactions and further promote the separation of photoexcited charges [34]. Under UV–Vis irradiation, Wang group found that the 13.4% CaTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure sample greatly enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the CO generation rate was up to 11.72 μmol g−1h−1, which was nearly 5.6 times higher than that of bare TiO2 nanosheets [34]. Thus, the CaTiO3/TiO2 heterojunction is beneficial to separation of photogenerated carriers because of their matched band structures and similar crystal structures. What’s more, CaTiO3 and TiO2 are good single catalyst for solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion by light-driven water splitting [30,35]. Recently, it has been reported that many CaTiO3 or TiO2-based photocatalytic materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production [35,36]. For example, after adding H2PtCl6·6H2O, the hydrogen generation rate of Z-scheme MoS2/CaTiO3 heterostructure is up to 622.14 μmol g-1h−1, which is approximately 3.11 times higher than that of CaTiO3 (200.14 μmol g-1h−1) [12]. With the help of noble metal Pt, the TiO2/g-C3N4 composite (50 wt%) shows the highest photocatalytic activity (4128 μmol g-1h−1) among the experimental samples, which is 1.9 times higher than that of TiO2 (2205 μmol g-1h−1) under the same experimental conditions [37]. Hence, it is meaningful to study the vectorial Z-Scheme system with CaTiO3, metal nanoparticle and TiO2 to form composite photocatalyst for their photocatalytic hydrogen production property. Usually, the synthesis of CaTiO3/TiO2 composite often requires to synthesize TiO2 firstly, then TiO2 reacted with Ca2+ to obtain CaTiO3/TiO2 composite [32,34]. In this work, we provided a novel, facile, yet unexplored route, for the synthesis of the CaTiO3/TiO2 composite and all-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst. The vector Z-scheme system was beneficial to enhance the separation of photogenerated carriers and reduce their recombination efficiency. The light-driven H2 generation property of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 has been investigated systematically, and the hydrogen production rate of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 was up to 23.550 mmol g-1h−1 with the appropriate amount of copper loading. Experimental results showed that the non-noble metal Cu could be an effective EM to increase photogenerated electrons’ transfer rate. This work provided an intelligent design of non-noble metal vector Z-scheme system photocatalytic materials (CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2) for H2 evolution via an easily implemented tactic."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of perovskite CaTiO3,"2.1 Preparation of perovskite CaTiO3 At first, 5 mmol of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd.) was added and then stirred magnetically in 20 mL deionized water for 15 min. Subsequently, 1.7 mL of [Ti(C4H9O)4] (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, MO) and 0.4 g of NaOH (Beijing Chemical Works) were added to the above solution. After additional agitation for 1 h, the white turbid liquid was transferred to an autoclave and then hydrothermally treated for 24 h at 180 ℃. After then, the white precipitate was washed with dilute CH3COOH (Beijing Chemical Works), deionized water and absolute alcohol in turn. Finally, the obtained sample was dried at 60 ℃ overnight."
3,Fabrication of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 vectorial Z-Scheme composite photocatalyst,"2.2 Fabrication of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 vectorial Z-Scheme composite photocatalyst 20 mg of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (Tianjin Guangfu) and 50 mg of EDTA (Beijing Chemical Works) were dissolved to 1 mL of deionized water overnight to form Cu ion chelate. Subsequently, the Cu ion chelate solution, 25 mg of PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone, K30, Tianjin Chemical Reagent Research Co.) were added to 25 mL of 2 mg mL−1 stabilized CaTiO3 colloid (30 v/v%, isopropanol (Beijing Chemical Works)/deionized water). After additional ultrasound for 3 min and stirring magnetically for 10 min, the blue liquid was transferred to an autoclave and then hydrothermally treated at 160 ℃ for 24 h. When the reaction finished, the obtained sample was washed with deionized water and absolute alcohol in turn. Finally, the sample was dried at 60 ℃ overnight. All the chemical reagents were used without further purification. The similar processes were operated for the preparation of other catalysts with different copper loading, by using 10, 30, 40 mg Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O as the starting materials, respectively. No catalyst, CaTiO3, CaTiO3/(10, 20, 30, 40) mg Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, were named without catalyst, CTO, CTO-Cu-1, CTO-Cu-2, CTO-Cu-3, and CTO-Cu-4, respectively."
4,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution The photocatalytic H2 generation activity experiments of these photocatalysts were performed with an online photocatalytic H2 production system (CEL-PAEM-D8, CEAULIGHT Co., Ltd.) at 6 ℃. A Xe lamp (300 W, covered by cutoff filter: JB 300) was acted as the simulating solar light source (300–1100 nm). Typically, 30 mg of photocatalyst was put into a 30 mL of mixing solution (20 vol% methanol as sacrificial agent (Beijing Chemical Works) and 80 vol% deionized water). Before irradiation, the reaction environment was degassed by vacuum pump for 30 min to make the whole reactor in the vacuum condition. The evolved H2 gas was collected for every hour and tested by a gas chromatograph (GC7920-DTA)."
5,Electrochemistry tests,"2.4 Electrochemistry tests The transient photocurrent response (TPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out by a electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). The CTO or CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst casted on the ITO glass was used as the working electrode. The 300 W Xe lamp was acted as simulating light source. In the three-electrode testing system, the Ag/AgCl electrode, Pt electrode and ITO glass with the sample were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. The Na2SO4 (0.5 mol L-1) solution was used as the electrolyte in all the electrochemistry tests."
6,Materials characterizations,"2.5 Materials characterizations The crystal phases and structures of these composite were obtained by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku TTR III X-ray diffractometer) with a monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation source (wavelength λ = 1.54056 Å). The microcosmic surface structures and fine structures of samples were recorded via scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7500F, JEOL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL). N2 sorption isotherms were measured by ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics USA). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos-Axis spectrometer) tests were carried out to analyze the surface elements of these composites. The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the as-obtained materials were monitored via an ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis, U-4100, Shimadzu) spectrophotometer in the range of 250–800 nm with the BaSO4 as reference. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and decay curves for the luminescence were tested by QM 8000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA, Canada)."
7,Computational details and models,"2.6 Computational details and models First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to simulate the Cu/CaTiO3 and Cu/TiO2 interfaces. We used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) functional [38] and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [39] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code [40]. A Hubbard U = 6 eV was used to describe electrons in Ti's d orbitals to account for electron–electron correlation effects. Wave functions are represented in plane-wave basis truncated at 500 eV. The sampling of the first Brillouin zone in the reciprocal space was made using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme [41] k-point grid with densities of 0.2 Å−1. Gaussian smearing method with a width of 0.1 eV was used for the electronic state. The 1.0 × 10-6 eV on the SCF convergence criteria for the electronic energy and the 0.005 eV/Å on geometry relaxation convergence criteria were employed in all the calculations. The vacuum layer of 15 Å was added along the direction perpendicular to the surface to avoid spurious interlayer interactions. The dipole correction was included because the interface configuration does not have mirror symmetry along the c-axis. Considering the XRD and HRTEM results, we selected the Cu (111), TiO2 (101), and CaTiO3 (110) surface models to construct the interface configurations due to the better structural matching. The Cu (111) slab is represented with six layers. The TiO2 (101) and CaTiO3 (110) slabs contain 12 and 16 units, respectively. The average lattice mismatch for both Cu/CaTiO3 and Cu/TiO2 interfaces were less than 3%."
8,Results and discussion,
9,"Phase, microcosmic morphology and structure of the composite","3.1 Phase, microcosmic morphology and structure of the composite The CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite was synthesized successfully by a facile two-step hydrothermal route. The TiO2 was formed on the surface of CaTiO3 during the second hydrothermal treatment. The crystal structures and phase purity of the CaTiO3 and CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 samples were analyzed by XRD (Fig. 1 ). At first, pure perovskite CaTiO3 was prepared through one-step hydrothermal method, whose diffraction peaks were highly consistent with Diffraction Standards card (PDF # 88–0790). After adding different quality (10, 20, 30 and 40 mg) Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O in the second step hydrothermal reaction, the CTO-Cu-1, CTO-Cu-2, CTO-Cu-3 and CTO-Cu-4 samples were successfully prepared, respectively. According to the peak intensity of XRD, as the mass of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O increased, the content of anatase TiO2 (PDF # 84–1286) and Cu simple substance (PDF # 85–1326) continued to increase. It is possible that part CaTiO3 was transformed into TiO2 in-situ. The EDS spectrum of CTO-Cu-2 (Fig. S1) was used to testify the presence of Cu, Ca, Ti and O elements, and the observed atom ratios of Ca, Ti, O, Cu atom in the materials were 5.36%, 10.93%, 83.05% and 0.66%, respectively. Thus, the mole ratio of CaTiO3 and TiO2 was about 5.36: 5.57 in CTO-Cu-2 sample, which was close to 1:1. In order to characterize the morphologies and sizes of the CTO and CTO-Cu-2 in detail, their SEM, TEM and HRTEM images are displayed in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a and c show the SEM and TEM images of CTO sample. It was clear that there were many grooves on the surface of CTO, which not only provided more reaction sites, but also benefited the loading of Cu simple substance. As shown in Fig. 2b, d, there were many nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of CaTiO3, which should be the mixture of Cu and TiO2. Meanwhile, the HRTEM images of CTO and CTO-Cu-2 samples were provided. The lattice fringe (about 0.387 nm) in Fig. 2e and Fig. S2a was agreed well with the (110) facet (0.382 nm) of the CaTiO3. And there were three different lattice fringes in Fig. 2f and Fig. S2b, 0.376 nm (CaTiO3 (110)), 0.348 nm (anatase TiO2 (101)) and 0.208 nm (Cu (111)) [9,25,34], further indicating the presence of CaTiO3, TiO2 and Cu in the obtained composite. This datum also confirmed that the CaTiO3, TiO2 and Cu were in close contact after facile two-step hydrothermal treatment. To study the grooves structures of CTO and CTO-Cu-2 surfaces, their nitrogen sorption isotherms and pore size distributions (Fig. 3 a and b) were analyzed. Their nitrogen sorption isotherms displayed type IV isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop, illustrating that they possessed mesoporous structure [42]. And the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of CTO-Cu-2 sample (about 34.3 m2 g−1) was about 4 times higher than that of CTO sample (about 8.2 m2 g−1), which indicated that CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite could provide more active sites for the photocatalytic H2 production [4]. And their pore sizes (25–185 nm range) were reckoned by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method (Fig. 3b, Table 1 ). At the same time, the existence of pores is conducive to multi-light scattering/reflection, thereby enhancing the harvest of excitation light and improving the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, it was important that there was hierarchical porosity consisted of mesopores (25.9 nm) connected with macropores (185.9 nm) on surface of CTO-Cu-2 (Table 1), which favored fast mass transport and further improved H2 production rate [43]. To study the effect of CH3COO– and Cu2+ ions on TiO2 generation, we designed these controlled experiments in which 0 mg Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, 20 mg Ca(CH3COO)2 and 20 mg CuSO4 were substituted for Cu(CH3COO)2 in the second step hydrothermal reaction. And the composition of obtained samples was CaTiO3/TiO2, CaTiO3/TiO2, CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2, and were named CTO-Cu-0, CTO-Ca-TO, CTO-Cu-TO, respectively (Fig. S3d, the specific experimental method was shown in Supporting Information). It was clear that TiO2 could still generate without CH3COO– and Cu2+ ions (Fig. S3d, CTO-Cu-0). And the CH3COO– and Cu2+ ions also had not obvious effect on the formation of TiO2 (Fig. S3d, CTO-Ca-TO, CTO-Cu-TO). As shown in Fig. S3a and b, there were many anatase TiO2 nanosheets on CaTiO3 surface, which further suggested that part CaTiO3 was transformed into anatase TiO2 in-situ (CaTiO3 → TiO2). In addition, the XRD pattern of CTO-Cu-TO sample showed the formation of Cu simple substance (Fig. S3d). The SEM images of CTO-Cu-TO and CTO-Cu-2 samples were similar (Fig. S3c and Fig. 2b). In addition, the influence of solvent on the TiO2 formation was studied in the second step of hydrothermal process by the control experiments. When the solvent was only water, CaTiO3 was still CaTiO3 and no TiO2 was formed (Fig. S4a). When isopropanol was added to the solvent, a part of CaTiO3 at the surface was hydrolyzed to TiO2 in-situ (Fig. S4b). It shows that isopropanol has an important effect on the conversion of CaTiO3 to TiO2. When the solution contains water, isopropanol and copper acetate, the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite is obtained (Fig. S4c). Thus, CaTiO3 is stable without the other chemicals, and a part of CaTiO3 at the surface was hydrolyzed to TiO2 in-situ after adding isopropanol. And the reaction equations involved in the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite synthesis experiments (Scheme 2 ) are as follows: (1–1) [Ti(C4H9O)4] + 4H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 4C4H9OH (1–2) Ti(OH)4 + Ca2++2OH–→CaTiO3 + 3H2O (2–1) CaTiO3 + H2O(isopropanol) → TiO2 + Ca2++2OH– (2–2) Cu2++2e-→Cu In the beginning, [Ti(C4H9O)4] was hydrolyzed to Ti(OH)4, then Ti(OH)4 reacted with Ca2+ to obtain CaTiO3 under strongly alkaline conditions. In the second hydrothermal reaction, a part of CaTiO3 at the surface was hydrolyzed to TiO2 in-situ (CaTiO3/TiO2) [44,45]. Meanwhile, the thermal decomposition of Cu(CH3COO)2 yielded Cu nanoparticles to form CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite [46]. These phenomena further indicate that the CaTiO3/TiO2 and CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 complex photocatalyst can be synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method. The surface elements composition and chemical states of the CTO and CTO-Cu-2 were further analyzed by XPS. Compared with CTO sample, Cu element was appeared in the full XPS spectrum of CTO-Cu-2 sample besides Ca, Ti and O elements (Fig. S5). Fig. 4 show the high-resolution scans of Ca 2p, Ti 2p, O 1s and Cu 2p, respectively. Compared to CTO, the Ca 2p3/2 (346.2 eV) and Ca 2p1/2 (349.6 eV) peaks of CTO-Cu-2 shifted to the higher binding energy (Fig. 4a), which indicated the strong interaction between CaTiO3 and TiO2 [12,34]. The strong interaction should be attributed to the formation of a small number of chemical bonds ([Ti-O]-Ca) on the surface of CaTiO3 [47,48]. And the peak of Ca 2p shifts to higher binding energy may be due to slightly higher electron loss in this case [49]. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the two peaks at 458.3 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.1 eV (Ti 2p1/2) of Ti4+ species were due to spin-orbital splitting [50]. The peaks of CTO at 529.8, 532.1 and 533.4 eV can be attributed to the TiO bond, surface adsorbed OH– group and carbonate species, respectively (Fig. 4c) [50,51]. The peak of CTO-Cu-2 at 531.2 eV was assigned to the oxygen defect (Fig. 4c). As shown in Fig. 4d, the peaks of CTO-Cu-2 at 932.1 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 951.5 eV (Cu 2p1/2) further revealed the existence of Cu NPs in the CTO-Cu-2 heterojunction [52]."
10,Photocatalytic activity of vectorial Z-scheme CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity of vectorial Z-scheme CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction To investigate the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction, the H2 evolution experiments through water splitting were performed (methanol as sacrificial agent). As displayed in Fig. 5 a, pure CaTiO3 exhibited relatively poor hydrogen evolution rate (0.024 mmol g-1h−1) owing to its narrow light response range and high recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Compare to pure CaTiO3, the hydrogen evolution rate of CaTiO3/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst was improved (CTO-Cu-0: 0.253 mmol g-1h−1, CTO-Ca-TO: 0.108 mmol g-1h−1, Fig. S6a). Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of the vectorial Z-scheme CTO-Cu-2 composite was remarkably increased to 23.550 mmol g-1h−1 (Fig. 5a), which was about 981-fold and 93-fold higher than that of pure CaTiO3 and CTO-Cu-0 samples, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was attributed to the vectorial Z-scheme heterostructure, which could boost the separation and transport rates of photoexcited carriers and reduce their recombination efficiency [53]. When the Cu(CH3COO)2 was replaced by CuSO4 in the second step hydrothermal reaction, this final product (CTO-Cu-TO) also showed good hydrogen production rate (14.824 mmol g-1h−1, Fig. S6a). This result further shows that the all-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite is a good photocatalyst material for hydrogen generation. Moreover, the stability of the photocatalyst is one of the crucial indicators to evaluate its performance. In order to evaluate the durability of CTO-Cu-2 sample, the repeated photocatalysis experiments were carried out. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate showed about 10.5 % decline after four runs. In recent years, lots of work have been committed to preparing different kinds of vectorial Z-scheme composite photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production. Additionally, not only noble metal (Au/Pt) NPs but also multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can be used as electron mediator (Table 2 ) [20,27]. It is obvious that the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction synthesized in this work had efficient hydrogen evolution rate under simulated sunlight irradiation. Thus, the photocatalyst vectorial Z-scheme CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite could be a promising candidate for solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion through light-driven water splitting."
11,Analyses of the enhanced photocatalytic performance,"3.3 Analyses of the enhanced photocatalytic performance The energy band structure is of great significance for analyzing the root cause of the enhanced photocatalytic activity. The UV–Vis DRS of as-prepared samples were characterized to evaluate the optical property and energy band characteristics. As displayed in Fig. 6 a, CaTiO3 showed an obvious band-edge absorption at ca. 355 nm, and the band-edge absorption of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 samples at ca. 400 nm could be attributed to anatase TiO2 [58], which further indicated that the formation of TiO2 in the second step hydrothermal reaction. It was clear that the absorption range extended to the visible light region (595 nm) after the Cu NPs loading, which may be due to the darker color of the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 samples. In addition, CTO-Cu-2 sample had the strongest absorption in the ultraviolet region, which was consistent with the highest hydrogen production rate of CTO-Cu-2 sample. And the colors of these samples were getting deeper and deeper with the amount of Cu NPs increasing (the insets in Fig. 6a). In addition, the optical band gap energy was estimated using this formula (1) [59]: (1) α h ν = A h ν - E g n/2 where α, h, ν, A and Eg are the absorption coefficient, Planck’s constant, light frequency, constant and band gap energy, respectively. Hence, the band gap energies of CTO and CTO-Cu-2 could be reckoned to be 3.61 and 3.37 eV (Fig. S7), respectively. Moreover, the CB and VB for CaTiO3 and TiO2 could be obtained by the empirical Eqs. (2) and (3) [60]: (2) E VB = X - E e + 0.5 E g (3) E CB = E VB - E g where EVB, X, Ee, Eg and ECB are the VB edge potential, Mulliken electronegativity, energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 V), band gap energy and CB edge potential, respectively. The X values of CaTiO3 and TiO2 are 5.35 and 5.81 eV, respectively. Based on the empirical Eqs. (2) and (3), the EVB and ECB of CaTiO3 and TiO2 were (2.66 V and −0.95 V) and (3.00 V and −0.37 V), respectively, indicating that the CB edge potentials of CaTiO3 and TiO2 were higher than the H+/H2 reduction potential (0 V at pH = 0) and they all had the ability to generate H2 via water splitting. Moreover, their CB and VB positions were staggered, which met the condition to form II-type semiconductor heterostructure. Therefore, the strong BIEF effect in CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterostructure can boost the separation and transfer rates of photogenerated carriers and lead to the efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate [34]. To further study the change of photoexcited carriers’ recombination rate, the lifetimes of photoinduced carriers, PL emission spectra, transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests of samples were performed. The PL lifetime decay curves (Fig. 6b) could be fitted successfully based on first-order exponential decay equation. The lifetimes (τ) of CTO, CTO-Cu-1, CTO-Cu-2, CTO-Cu-3, and CTO-Cu-4 samples were 0.26, 0.49, 0.36, 0.35 and 0.29 ns, respectively. The lifetimes of CTO-Cu samples became definitely longer than that of CTO, which revealed that the photoexcited carriers’ recombination efficiency would significantly reduce [61]. Additionally, the PL emission peak intensity of CTO-Cu-2 was lower than that of CTO (Fig. S8), further indicating the more efficient photogenerated carriers’ separation on the surface of CTO-Cu-2 sample [62]. The generation of photocurrent is primarily due to the fast separation of photogenerated carriers and fast transfer of photoinduced electrons on the surface of the working electrode under irradiation [63,64]. Under light irradiation, the photocurrent of CTO-Cu-2 was about 26 times as high as that of CTO (Fig. 7 a), which further demonstrated that the photoexcited carriers’ separation and transfer efficiencies were enhanced on the surface of CTO-Cu-2. In addition, the smaller radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Nyquist plot, the lower resistance for the charge transfer, resulting in higher separation efficiency of photoexcited carriers. As displayed in Fig. 7b, the interfacial resistance for CTO-Cu-2 was smaller than that of CTO, leading to a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs on CTO-Cu-2 surface [4]. Both the low recombination rate of the photoexcited carriers and rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons were helpful to enhance the photocatalytic H2 production rate of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite. In order to further study the stability of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite, we tested XRD, SEM and XPS of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 after photocatalytic reaction. Through comparing the XRD patterns of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 before and after photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 1 and Fig. 8 a), there were no bright changes in the position of the diffraction peaks. As shown in 8b, SEM image of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 sample had also not changed significantly after the photocatalytic experiment. Comparing the XPS spectra of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 before and after photocatalytic reaction (Fig. S5, Fig. 4, Fig. S9, Fig. 8c and Fig. 8d), there were no obvious changes in the peaks position of all elements. These phenomena further showed that CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst had good stability."
12,The possible mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"3.4 The possible mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen generation To further certify the correctness of the Z-scheme, the theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) were conducted for CaTiO3/Cu (Fig. S10a) and TiO2/Cu (Fig. S10b) heterojunctions. Because both CaTiO3 and TiO2 are semiconductors, the Fermi energy levels of CaTiO3/Cu and TiO2/Cu are determined by the metal Cu and are usually considered to be fixed [23]. As shown in Fig. 9 a and b, due to the different electronic states, the CBM and the VBM of CaTiO3 is more positive than that of TiO2 relative to the Fermi level according to the density of states (DOS) figure, indicating that the CaTiO3 owns strong reduction ability and TiO2 owns strong oxidization ability in the photocatalytic reaction [23]. Thus, it can be conjectured that CaTiO3 and TiO2 in the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite can act as the reduction and oxidization zones, respectively. As a result, the band alignment of CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction is Z-scheme. Based on the above results and some literature [20,23], a tentative mechanism for photocatalytic H2 generation over the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite has been proposed. As shown in Scheme 3 , photoexcited electrons and holes are produced simultaneously on both CaTiO3 and TiO2 under irradiation. There are two major electron-hole pairs transmission paths (internal and external paths) in the vector CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 Z-scheme system. For the internal path, the part photoinduced electrons on the CB of TiO2 can easily flow into Cu NPs by the interfacial BIEF. Then, the electrons in Cu NPs transferred rapidly to the VB of CaTiO3 and recombined with the holes of CaTiO3. For the external path, there were more available electrons with strong reducing ability on the CB of CaTiO3 can be remained and used to generate hydrogen through reduction reaction. Simultaneously, the holes with strong oxidation ability on the VB of TiO2 were eliminated by the sacrificial agent (methanol) in the solution. Thus, the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 heterojunction composite material can efficiently promote photocatalytic H2 production through water splitting for the following reasons: (1) the matched band structures of CaTiO3 and TiO2, which conducive to the formation of the CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 vector Z-scheme system to effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and reduce their recombination efficiency; (2) The formation of the BIEF effect between CaTiO3 and TiO2 and the loading of electron mediator (Cu NPs) can facilitate part electrons transfer from to the CB of TiO2 to VB of CaTiO3."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, the all-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst with efficient hydrogen generation rate was successfully prepared via the facile two-step hydrothermal route for the first time. Particularly, Cu NPs as electron mediator with CaTiO3, TiO2 to form the vector Z-scheme system showed that non-noble metal Cu can be an effective electron mediator to accelerate photoexcited electrons transfer. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the obtained CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 composite with the appropriate amount of copper loading exhibited the remarkable photocatalytic activity of 23.550 mmol g-1h−1, which was about 981 times and 93 times higher than that of pristine CaTiO3 (0.024 mmol g-1h−1) and CaTiO3/TiO2 (0.253 mmol g-1h−1), respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the in-situ loading of electron mediator (Cu NPs) in the vector Z-scheme system can effectively promote the separation of photoexcited carriers and reduce their recombination efficiency, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 generation performance. Moreover, we proposed the possible transmission mechanism (internal and external paths) of photogenerated carriers’ excitation-recombination process on CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst. In this study, we offered a new synthesis route (anatase TiO2 nanosheets generated in-situ on the surface of CaTiO3) to prepare CaTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure, and the photocatalyst CaTiO3/Cu/TiO2 could be a potential candidate for solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion through water splitting. This may open a new prospect for the development of low-cost but efficient non-noble metal vector Z-scheme composite photocatalysts to boost photocatalytic H2 generation activity."
