0,Introduction,"Landfill leachate is highly polluted wastewater from percolating of rainwater accompanied by municipal waste and suspended matters (Ab Ghani et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2020). Landfill leachate is a potential cause of surface and groundwater contamination if not properly managed. This is because the leachate can easily migrate through soils and sub-soils that could eventually pollute streams, water wells and creeks (Tatsi et al., 2003; El-Salam and Abu-Zuid, 2015; Yong et al., 2018). Among the negative impacts of landfilling, leachate contamination raised major public concerns as it could be potentially hazardous to human health as well (Njoku et al., 2019). Treatment of wastewater is imperative to avert these risks (Rambabu et al., 2019, 2020). Moreover, landfill leachate is considered one of the most challenging effluents to treat attributed by its variable composition, characteristic and strength (Tugtas et al., 2013; Borba et al., 2019). Treatment for landfill leachate varies based on multiple factors such as characteristic of leachate, composition of leachate, age of landfill, moisture content, landfill engineering design and operation (Aziz et al., 2007; Moradi and Ghanbari, 2014) and therefore posing a great challenge that requires advanced treatment. The pH values of landfill leachate vary based of the age of landfill. Typically, young landfill leachate has pH less than 6.5, intermediate landfill leachate pH falls between 6.5 and 7.5 while mature landfill has pH value higher than 7.5 (Aziz and Ramli, 2018). Various advanced leachate treatment technologies have been proposed (Show et al., 2019). Practically, coagulation-flocculation method is most commonly employed to remove suspended particles from the wastewater (Amor et al., 2015; Oloibiri et al., 2015). Coagulation and flocculation process works by neutralizing suspended particles that are negatively charged (Saritha et al., 2017). Subsequently, the destabilized particles agglomerates to make up bigger flocs (Lee et al., 2014). Alum or poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) is the preferred choice of coagulant due to its wide availability and exceptional high coagulation efficiency (Zhao et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the usage of these coagulants suffers a drawback of potential release of residual toxic aluminium to the environment due to excess usage (Krewski et al., 2007). Health risk associated with prolonged exposure to aluminium includes bioaccumulation of the metal in human body, particularly in organ such as brain, bone and liver (Walton, 2012). Besides, residual aluminium in water is also associated with brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s as well as carcinogenic effects (Camacho et al., 2017). Therefore, the potential health risk associated with leachate pollution and the presence of residual aluminium from excess usage in water necessitates an optimized treatment process for landfill treatment. The application of coagulation-flocculation process is rather complex because it is composition-dependent. The dosing of coagulant plays an important role as under dosing will reduce pollutant removal efficiency whereas over dosing will lead to release of residual aluminium (Keeley et al., 2014). The treatment also entails high operation cost associated with cost of coagulant, chemical used to adjust pH, and mechanical energy required for mixing. Therefore, these parameters need to be taken into account in optimization of coagulation-flocculation process which consist of coagulant dosage, pH and mixing speed. The usage of alum seems to give wide range of the outcome (Djeffal et al., 2019) which has not been well understood yet. This is because there is no extensive study on the characterization of flocs after treatment with alum. The understanding of the flocs formation will assist the future treatment of landfill leachate more effectively. Optimization tool such as response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD) is employed in which it combines mathematical and statistical approaches to fit experimental results using polynomial equation (Sakkas et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2016). The process is effective and capable of elucidating the actual optimum condition because the synergy effect of multiple parameters is taken into consideration. Although there are many studies on the treatment of landfill leachate (Tripathy et al., 2019), limited studies were found on the optimization and the mechanism of coagulation and flocculation process in landfill leachate treatment using alum. In this study, RSM with CCD was applied to optimize the landfill leachate treatment by minimizing the usage of alum as coagulant and flocculant. The proposed conditions and the performance of pollutant removal include color, suspended solids and turbidity were also preliminarily evaluated. Subsequently, optimized condition for best COD removal is proposed. The mechanism of pollutant removal of using alum elucidated that hydrogen bond play a crucial role in the flocs formation. The hydrogen bonding seems to be responsible for the good aggregation between alum and pollutants in leachate. The optimized conditions for alum coagulation, floc characterization and FTIR analysis could address the knowledge gap to elucidate inherent mechanism involved in leachate pretreatment using alum coagulant."

2,Leachate characteristics,"2.1 Leachate characteristics The leachate was sampled from Jeram sanitary landfill site situated in Kuala Selangor District, Selangor, Malaysia with geographical location latitude of 03̊ 11′3.92′N and a longitude of 101̊ 21′11.11′E. It is located at the west coast of Peninsula Malaysia which is characterized by tropical climate. The climate is warm and humid throughout the year. Temperature of the site ranges from 27.1 to 28.5 °C and the site receives annual rainfall of 2802.1 mm. The landfill site is surrounded by palm oil tree plantation. It encompasses an area of 160 acres and receives 2500 tons/d of domestic waste while the leachate treatment plant has the capacity of 920 m3/d. The site has been operating since January 2007. The leachate sample was collected from detention pond and then quickly transported to the laboratory for preservation. The sample is stored in cold room at 4 °C to prevent any changes be it biological or chemical. Characterization of leachate sample is then carried out in accordance to the analytical procedures of Standard Method of Water and Wastewater, American Public Health Association (American Public Health Association. APHA, 2012) as depicted in Table 1 ."
3,Coagulation-flocculation test,"2.2 Coagulation-flocculation test In this study, a jar test apparatus of Lovibond, Model Floc Tester ET750 was used for the coagulation and flocculation test where sample was mixed in 1-L cylindrical beakers. Stirring was performed by impellers attached to rectangular blades. Speed and time of mixing were pre-set by automatic controller and timer. The alum coagulant (aluminium sulfate) stock solution of 1000 g L-1 was prepared by dissolving aluminium sulfate in ionized water. The coagulant was then added to leachate sample and the mixing process was conducted in two stages. At the first stage, the mixture was rapid mixed at 150 rpm for 5 min and then followed by slow mixing at 60 rpm for 15 min. After mixing process, the flocs were left untouched to allow settling for 30 min. Then the supernatant were collected with a plastic syringe below sample surface for further analysis. The color, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), suspended solid and turbidity were analysed. According to COD value, the removal efficiencies were calculated using Eq. (1) (Aljerf, 2018). (1) R e m o v a l ( % ) = C i − C f C i × 100 % where C i and C f are the initial and final COD value of leachate pollutant, respectively."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The leachate sample was analysed for multiple physicochemical parameters such as COD, pH, suspended solids, turbidity and color. Closed reflux method as described in APHA Standard Method was used to determine the COD level by using a HACH digester to heat up the reagent at 150 °C for 2 h. Measurement of COD level was then carried out with HACH DR2800 spectrophotometer. Suspended solids, turbidity and color were measured by using a Lovibond MD600 portable photometer. The pH was measured using Mettler Toledo F20 m. The measurement of COD, turbidity, suspended solids and color are carried out in triplicate, and the average readings are presented. Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry (ICP-OES) (PerkinElmer Optima 5300DV ICP-OES) was employed to determine and quantify metals present in the leachate sample. The morphology of dried floc was studied by using a Thermo Scientific Quanta field emission scanning electron microscope. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis of floc was carried out using PerkinElmer FTIR-Spectrum 400."
5,Design of experiment and data analysis,"2.4 Design of experiment and data analysis Design of experiment, mathematical modelling along with optimization of coagulation-flocculation process were performed using surface methodology technique via Design Expert 11 software (Mukherjee et al., 2018; Tripathy et al., 2019). The central composite model (CCD) was adopted to optimize chief parameters including dose of alum, pH of leachate and mixing speed. The central values obtained were 750 mgL−1, 8.5 and 100 rpm, respectively. The range of the variables was determined after a series of preliminary experiments. The flexible and highly diversified second order polynomial equation was applicable to elucidate the relationship of the variables and responses using Eq. (2) (Shalabh, 2013). (2) y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 k β i x i + ∑ i = 1 k β i i x i 2 + ∑ i ⊇ j k ∑ i = 1 k β i j x i x j where, y = predicted response, β 0 = offset term, β i = linear effect, β i i = squared effect, β i j = interaction effect. In CCD, the factorial design requires input of three types of points: center points, axial points and cube points. In which the total experiment number can be calculated using the following Eq. (3). In current study, the total experiment number from the equation is 20. (3) T o t a l n u m b e r o f e x p e r i m e n t s = 2 k + 2 k + C 0 where, k = number of factors, 2 k = cubic runs, 2 k = axial runs, and C 0 = center point’s run."

7,Performance of alum for the removal of pollutants,"3.1 Performance of alum for the removal of pollutants Preliminary studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of alum for the removal of COD and other physical contaminants removal including turbidity, color and suspended solid. Accordingly, the alum dosage range was narrowed down to 600–850 mgL-1 to determine optimum dose. It was found that alum was effective to remove COD, turbidity, color and suspended solid from the leachate. However, the sensitivity of removal performance differs in respect to changing parameters. Fig. 1 a shows that at natural pH of leachate (8.4–8.6) the highest COD removal of 52.1% was observed at alum dosage at 750 mgL−1 with constant mixing speed of 100 rpm. Based on other study (Ghafari et al., 2010), the removal of leachate is around 50–65%. However, the highest turbidity removal (92.8%) was observed at 700 mgL−1 due to sweep flocculation effect as the dosage was near saturation level, in which overdosing effect can be observed at higher dosage of 750 mgL−1with reduced turbidity removal to 89.7% (Yang et al., 2010). At the higher dosage above 750 mgL−1, COD removal decreases because flocculation of suspended particles is hindered. Particle aggregation study conducted by Wu et al. (2009) showed that at high dosage of alum, flocs formed from sweep flocculation mechanism are loose and tend to break down easily. As shown in Fig. 1b, The COD removal was the highest (53.5%) at 100 rpm mixing speed with 750 mgL−1 of alum. Nevertheless, the COD, turbidity, suspended solid and color removal decreased dramatically as the mixing speed exceed 200 rpm. This suggest that high mixing speed is inefficient for floc formation. Others also observed this phenomenon (Yang et al., 2010) in which the high mixing speed tend to break the floc. While determining range of suitable pH for optimization study, hydrochloric acid was added to lower down pH of the leachate. However, formation of foam was observed after pH adjustment, likely due to high amount of surfactant in the leachate, similarly observed by Tizaoui et al. (2007). The most effective pH for coagulation process of leachate sample is 8.5 with 750 mgL−1 of alum and 100 rpm (Fig. 1c). At pH 8.5, the COD, turbidity, color, and suspended solid removal are 28.97, 90.5, 77.3 and 88.5%, respectively. Although Palaniandy et al. (2010) reported 79% COD removal of the leachate using alum, the leachate was pre-treated with Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) with pH adjusted to 7. In this study, the satisfactory range of 52.1–53.5% COD removal of leachate could be achieved by adjusting the dosage of alum, mixing speed without any pre-treatment and pH adjustment. This finding suggests that coagulation using alum is satisfactory and could also achieve higher efficiency with the optimization tool."
8,Optimization of coagulation-flocculation process using alum,"3.2 Optimization of coagulation-flocculation process using alum The effect of operating parameters (alum dosage, pH and mixing speed) and their synergistic interactions were studied using CCD in RSM. The model generated the following reduced second order polynomial Eq. (4): (4) C O D = 52.63 − 0.2010 × d o s e + 6.76 × p H + 3.84 × m i x i n g s p e e d + 0.0137 × d o s e × p H − 0.2388 × d o s e × m i x i n g s p e e d + 0.1337 × p H × m i x i n g s p e e d + 0.0623 d o s e 2 − 17.48 p H 2 − 1.84 × m i x i n g s p e e d 2 The high level factors are represented by positive sign while low level factors are represented by negative sign. The coefficient of each factor approximates the expected response per unit variation in factor value when the rest of the factors are kept unchanged. Therefore, the higher coefficient value also indicates the significance of factor in the model. Twenty experimental runs were generated and the experimental data are analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to elucidate the synergistic relationship between the input factors and the output response which is COD removal in percentage. ANOVA also evaluates the variations between group of data to adjudge if their mean values are equal (Karimifard and Moghaddam, 2018). The result of ANOVA is shown in Table SM-1 to investigate interaction between operating parameters and the responses. The model F-value of 419.60 implies the model is statistically significant. The significance of study is also represented by the p-value of <0.0001. In the present study, mixing speed, pH, mixing speed2 and pH2 are the significant model terms. The accuracy of the model and the statistical significance were analysed using adjusted R2 and predicted R2. The adequate precision of 57.100 also indicates an adequate signal which translate into high signal to noise ratio. In this study, the adjusted R2 value obtained was 0.9950, which agrees reasonably with the predicted R2 value of 0.9860. The value also signifies a good fit between the experimental result and predicted result. The lack of fit value of 0.0920 also verified that the developed model is significant. Moreover, the predicted values versus actual experimental values graph depicted that the data are distributed closely along the straight line (Fig. 2 ). 3.2.1 Effect of dose and mixing speed Fig. 3 a and b shows the response surface plot for COD removal in response to variation of alum dosage and pH as well as dosage and mixing speed, respectively. It can be observed from the absence of contour line that the effect of alum dosage and mixing speed were not as significant as the pH in leachate treatment. In contrary with Ghafari et al. (2009), they claimed that dosage of alum played a significant role in leachate treatment. The dosage of alum is critical in the landfill leachate treatment because of the economic evaluation purpose and the avoidance of excessive alum in the discharge water. However, alum is well known to carry out sweep coagulation and thus excessive dosage will decrease the coagulation efficacy (Malik, 2018). For instance, Syafalni et al. (2012) reported 10,000 mgL−1 is needed to achieve maximum COD removal of 84.9% for stabilized landfill leachate, the range of alum dosage needed is summarised in Table 2 . Simultaneously, the mixing speed also plays an important role for elevated coagulation performance during the treatment. Initial rapid mixing is crucial to ensure coagulant and suspension is uniformly distributed. During the mixing, high velocities may cause the flocs breakage due to surface erosion. 3.2.2 Effect of pH As shown in Fig. 3c, the clear peaks indicated in three-dimensional response plot suggests that the pH is the most important factor. The two-dimensional plot of the responses on the pH—mixing speed plane (contour plot) depicts co-axial curve in which the center represents best conditions for 54% COD removal from initial concentration of 979 mgL−1 to final concentration of 455 mgL−1 at pH 8.5 and mixing speed of 100 rpm. In contrast with previous study (Marañón et al., 2008), the optimum removal of 26.4% COD was governed by adjusting the pH of leachate to 3.8. Interestingly, at higher pH, polymeric species of alum can better encourage colloids to adsorb on its surface. This finding further affirms that coagulation and flocculation treatment of landfill leachate presents high variability in treatment response based on operating parameters. In current study, when pH is adjusted to below natural pH (7.5–8), formation of foam hindered the coagulation process and the COD removal. Low COD removal at low pH is due to the formation of hydrogen ion at low pH which compete with metal hydrolysis product for organic ligands (Tatsi et al., 2003). On the other hand, at pH 8.5, COD removal increases presumably due to the feasible conditions that promotes adsorption, cross-linking and bridging between colloid particles. This finding is well agreed with by Zheng et al. (2011) that acidic condition results in dissociations of alum to form Al3+ which will be unsuitable for colloid adsorption, cross-linking and bridging as well as adhesion. Table 2 shows summary of similar studies of COD removal by coagulation treatment using alum. The initial pH for landfill leachate of current study is similar to other mature landfills. In comparison with previous studies, optimization study showed that pH adjustment was not needed for optimal COD reduction of current study. In addition, the alum dosage of 750 mgL−1 was also lower than the required dosage from previous studies (Ghafari et al., 2009; Farrokhi et al., 2015). Evidently, optimization tool provide important information to reduce operational cost associated to pH adjustment and coagulant dosage especially when dealing with high volume wastewater such as leachate. 3.2.3 Optimization of treatment and validation of model Optimization of COD removal using alum was performed using desirability function in multiple surface response modelling. The main purpose of the function is to optimize assorted combo of operating parameters for highest performance in COD removal. The optimal values of each factors were then ascertained by further experiment based on the optimal parameter values generated from the desirability function. Table SM-2 shows the optimal parameter values and desirability. The model shows a significant computation of COD removal at a comparably small error at 0.7%. From this result, it validated that the model can predict the COD removal accurately with relatively small error."
9,Physiochemical characteristic of the flocs,"3.3 Physiochemical characteristic of the flocs The surface morphology of alum flocs from the leachate treatment is presented in Fig. 4 . The SEM images shows that the flocs are well and compact in nature. The flocs seems to have many porous linkages and an amorphous surface structure. The rough and non-uniformly distributed porous structure also showed that aggregation of leachate particle has taken place (Teh et al., 2014). Fig. 5 depicts the FTIR spectra of leachate sample and alum flocs. The FTIR spectroscopy was conducted to gain further insights on the inherent mechanism involved in coagulation and flocculation process. FTIR spectra shows that there are occurrence of similar functional groups between leachate sample and alum flocs but the relative intensity of transmittance varied due to physicochemical interaction between leachate sample and active groups in alum coagulant (Ghani et al., 2017). Leachate and alum flocs show broad and strong peaks at 3276 cm−1 that coincides with Al–OH–Al stretching mixed with OH vibration commonly found with aliphatic alcohol groups (Djeffal et al., 2019). Another sharp peak observed at 1600 cm−1 also indicated the stretching of O–H group attributed to hydroxyl group within alum along with vibration of Al–O bond (Ni et al., 2012; Hussain and Haydar, 2020). In the alum flocs, new peak at 1109 cm−1 is corresponded to the presence of CN stretch which signifies that nitrogenous group is removed from the leachate (Mukherjee et al., 2014). Similarly, the appearance of new peak could also indicate the presence of HOO matrix (Singh et al., 2012). Although the FTIR spectrum of leachate and alum flocs is similar, several shifts of peak from 1365 to 2378 cm−1 are probably attributed O–H vibration in tertiary alcohols and CH2 groups (Day Jr, 1963). The presence of O–H groups also affirms that hydrogen bonds was formed between suspended solids in leachate and alum during coagulation process (Baranović, 2014). This is also concordance with other studies (Shi et al., 2007; Mukherjee et al., 2018) that hydrogen bond is formed during coagulation process. According to Hussain and Haydar (2020), the evidence of OH and HOO groups suggest formation of H bonds within alum coagulant, which normally form different hydrates such as hexadecahydrate (Al2(SO4)3·16H2O) and octadecahydrate (Al2(SO4)3·18H2O). These findings suggested that the formation of hydrogen bonds is responsible for pollutant removal in leachate during alum treatment."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, 54% of COD removal is achieved at alum dosage of 750 mgL−1, pH 8.5 and mixing speed of 100 rpm. The usage of optimum dosage of alum restrict the release of residual aluminium into the environment. The pH was found to be main contributing factor that improve the COD removal. The model shows high R2 value of 0.99 for regression model equation which verified that there is adequate agreement between experimental data and the model. The SEM micrograph indicated formation of compact flocs. Based on FTIR spectrum, there is a clear interaction between alum and leachate. This interaction is mainly due to formation of hydrogen bonds which is responsible for the coagulation and flocculation of the leachate. This study provides useful optimization result towards effective landfill leachate treatment technology. Similarly, effective pre-treatment of landfill leachate that reduces pollutant and toxicity of wastewater also proved to be the key point to facilitate better downstream processing treatment for resource recovery."
