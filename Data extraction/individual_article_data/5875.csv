0,Introduction,"The decrease of fossil fuels resources and the increase of the global climate change have made necessary the search of alternative energy sources such as biomass. The conversion of biomass to useful chemicals represents, in general, a major challenge. This turns out to be particularly ambitious if the process should be made in a sustainable and economical way, in order to replace the use of fossil fuels [1–3]. Among a variety of feedstocks derived from biomass, levulinic acid (LA) has been considered as a potential chemical platform with a broad range of applications [4]. LA can be obtained from the acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose [5], lignocellulosic sources [6], sucrose [7], starch and glucose [8], just to name a few biomass sources. LA constitutes a useful raw material for the production of added value chemicals, such as 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF), 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) and γ-valerolactone (GVL) [9], which is obtained from the hydrogenation of LA. GVL is a safe to store product and can be employed as a liquid fuel, food additive or as a solvent [10–14]. Currently, there are several methodologies for the hydrogenation of LA using both homogeneous [15] or heterogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium [16–18]: one of the most active metals for the hydrogenation of aliphatic carbonyl compounds [19]. In addition, a tandem process starting from sugars is potentially feasible since GVL can be obtained from d-glucose using an acid catalyst in combination with Ru/C [20]. Typically, LA has been hydrogenated to GVL using a large excess of H2 (30–100bar), harsh reaction conditions, co-catalysts [16] or additives (phosphines) [21], and the use of organic solvents instead of water [22]. In this context, the use of formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source in catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions is a well known method for the reduction of carbonyl functionalities [23]. FA is advantageously a liquid, relatively nontoxic, and has shown to be a reversible hydrogen storage system under very mild reaction conditions in the presence of the suitable catalysts [24,25], hence its use in the development of several catalytic systems [26,27]. Currently, few are the reports dealing with the LA hydrogenation or with closely related biomass derivatives along with the use of metal nanoparticles. Some of these processes usually require high temperatures [28,29]. Worthy to mention is the use of ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru-NPs) supported on titania (TiO2) as highly active catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL compared to the conventional ruthenium on carbon (Ru/C) catalyst [30]. Metal nanoparticles usually show great potential due to the their large active surface and their availability for chemical transformations [31]. Herein, we report a new catalytic system for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid based on Ru-NPs, using a readily available ruthenium source. In addition, the method is additive and phosphine free, employs one of two different hydrogen sources and is achieved under mild reaction conditions."
1,Results and discussion,"The use of Ru-NPs generated in situ from [Ru3(CO)12] allowed the hydrogenation of LA, key results for this transformation are summarized on Scheme 1 . An initial screening included a variety of solvents and H2 pressure (see Table 1 ). The use of THF and 3Å molecular sieves (3Å-MS) allowed the production of GVL in high yield (98.5%) with small amounts of 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) (entry 5); a similar experiment with the addition of a mercury drop showed a decrease in the activity, consistent with a heterogeneous process [32]. The use of alcohols as solvents yielded the corresponding ester as the main product (entries 2–4). Noteworthy, the use of water as solvent and a low H2 pressure allowed the production of GVL in very high yield (99%) (entry 8). The Ru-NPs involved in the reaction were isolated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation (10min at 5000 cycles/min), the corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. 1 . Ru-NPs exhibited an average size between 2 and 3nm for both THF (A) and water (B), while for the Ru-NPs in micrograph (C) the size is the smaller for the aqueous FA/Et3N system. These NPs were isolated from the LA hydrogenation using FA as hydrogen donor, having a diameter close to 1nm, probably due to the presence of Et3N acting as stabilizer [33,34]. As shown above, since the LA hydrogenation to produce GVL catalyzed by Ru-NPs using water as a solvent gave very good yields, we tested a variety of reaction conditions to optimize the reaction as summarized on Table 2 . The use of a low H2 pressure and 12h of reaction (entry 5) allowed 100% yield to GVL. By increasing the temperature, 1,4-PDO is produced in small amounts, derived from the hydrogenolysis of GVL [35]. Similarly, Table 3 contains the relevant results during the optimization of LA hydrogenation using FA as hydrogen donor. LA hydrogenation was carried out with an excess of FA and relatively high temperatures to ensure good or high conversions, since the use of stoichiometric amounts of acid and low temperatures yielded poor conversions. In all cases GVL was produced selectively. These results are in accordance with reports on the hydrogen generation from formic acid, it is know that hydrogen generation from formic acid in presence of triethylamine allows a higher catalyst activity, in the presence of a ruthenium-based catalyst [36]. In fact [Ru3(CO)12] is highly active for the generation of H2 from decomposition of formate at 75°C in the presence of KOH [37]. The catalyst recycling was assessed for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL using the FA/Et3N system and the conditions used on Entry 3, Table 3, Recycling yields are shown on Fig. 2 . Noteworthy, in the first and second cycles the catalyst recycling was successful; however, then after the third cycle the LA conversion decreased from 99% to 40% becoming completely inactive in the following cycle. We found that such behavior is related to agglomeration during the recycling process (see SI Section)."
2,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the current report describes a new selective and green procedure for the catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone in high yields with low loads of Ru-NPs, using low H2 pressure or formic acid as hydrogen donors and water as solvent. In this method acid-resistant Ru-NPs, generated in situ from [Ru3(CO)12], were used."
3,Experimental,"All manipulations were performed using a MBraun glovebox (<1ppm of H2O and O2). LA (98% purity), triethylamine (purity ⩾99.5%), molecular sieves (3Å) Ru3(CO)12, molecular sieves of 3Å and FA (reagent grade ⩾95%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and deoxygenated. Tetrahydrofuran (J.T. Baker) was dried and distilled from dark purple solutions of sodium/benzophenone ketyl radical. Methanol and ethyl acetate were purchased from J.T. Baker. Isopropyl alcohol was purchased from Mallinckrodf AR. Methanol and isopropyl alcohol were dried and distilled from solutions of metallic magnesium with iodine. All water used was distilled and deoxygenated under argon flow. Ultra high purity hydrogen (5.0, Praxair) was used."
4,Hydrogenation of LA with molecular hydrogen using Ru-NPs,"4.1 Hydrogenation of LA with molecular hydrogen using Ru-NPs Catalytic tests were carried out in 100mL stainless steel Parr autoclaves. In a typical experiment, the reactor was loaded with 1g of LA (8.6mmol), 3mg of nanoparticles precursor (Ru3CO12, 0.005mmol) and 15mL of distilled water, pressurized with 5bar H2 at room temperature, and heated at 130°C for 12h. The reaction mixture was extracted with 5×20mL of ethyl acetate and the solvent was removed with vacuum. Experiments with 3Å-MS and THF were carried out in a similar way. Batches of GVL were centrifuged after workup without observing deposition of metal nanoparticles."
5,Hydrogenation of LA with FA using Ru-NPs,"4.2 Hydrogenation of LA with FA using Ru-NPs In a typical experiment, the vessel was loaded with 1g of LA (8.6mmol), 3mg of nanoparticles precursor ([Ru3CO12], 0.005mmol) and 5mL of distilled water. Then were added 700μL of FA (820mg, 16.92mmol) and finally 220μL (1.57mmol) of Et3N. The reactor was heated at 130°C for 24h. The reaction mixture was extracted with 5×20mL of ethyl acetate and the solvent was removed by vacuum."
6,Catalyst recycling experiments,"4.3 Catalyst recycling experiments The catalyst recycling was made on a sample prepared as follows: using 3mg of [Ru3(CO)12], (0.005mmol), 1g of LA (8.6mmol), and 5mL of distilled water were charged in an autoclave, then 700μL of FA (820mg, 16.92mmol) were added followed by 220μL (1.57mmol) of Et3N, finally, the components were stirred at room temperature in a vessel for a few minutes and heated at 130°C for 24h. The LA was converted to GVL quantitatively, determined by GC–MS. Then all volatiles were removed by vacuum to yield a brown residue, which was used as the catalyst in the next reaction using the same reagents above quoted. Catalyst activity is completely lost after 4 cycles."
7,Hg (0) poisoning test,"4.4 Hg (0) poisoning test Homogeneity tests were performed following the above described procedures while in addition to the reactants, two mercury drops were added to the mixture. After reaction completion, the solution was filtered and analyzed by GC–MS. TEM micrographs were determined on a Jeol-2010 microscope equipped with a lanthanum hexaboride filament operating at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Samples for TEM observations were prepared by placing a thin film of the heptanes Ru-NPs solution in a holey carbon grid. The metal particle size distribution was estimated from the measurement of about 200 particles, assuming a spherical shape, found in an arbitrary chosen area in enlarged micrographs. Conversion and selectivity of the catalytic reactions were determined via Gas Chromatographic analyses performed on an Agilent 5975C system equipped with a 30m DB-5MS capillary (0.32mm ID) column."
