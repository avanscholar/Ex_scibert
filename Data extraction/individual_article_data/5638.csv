0,Introduction,"The oral route is most preferred way of drug administration due to its low cost, ease of use and high patient compliance, and presents around 70% of the US pharmaceutical market (Mohammad et al., 2019; Colombo et al., 2009). However, about 70% new synthesized compounds and 40% drugs on market are poorly water soluble, which limits their oral use (Fahr and Liu, 2009; Kalepu and Nekkanti, 2015; Lu et al., 2016). Nanocrystals, which were first introduced into pharmaceutical field in the early 1990s, are one of the technologies capable of overcoming the aforementioned obstacles. Nowadays, nanocrystals have proven their potential in oral drug delivery, with about ten commercial drug products and more than twenty products in different clinical trial stages (Lu et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2012; Keck et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2015). Bottom-up (precipitation) and top-down (disintegration) approaches are the two techniques to produce nanocrystals. In general, bottom-up techniques can produce nanocrystals with small particle size (around 100 nm), but suffer drawbacks like residual solvents, wide particle size distribution and low stability, therefore the bottom-up technique is not widely used. In the top down technologies, pearl/ball milling was widely used and there are several products, but a general problem of the method is the potential material erosion from the milling balls, leading to product contamination. Additional processing times (up to 24 h) or several produce cycles (more than 50 cycles) are needed to produce nanocrystals successfully, due to the relative weak breaking energy of pearl/ball milling. High pressure homogenization (HPH) is another frequently used alternative method nowadays (Kawabata et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2008), due to its high breaking forces at homogenization pressures up to around 2000 bars. This technique has advantages like low particle size distribution, good process repeatability and ease of scale-up. However, for several active pharmaceutical ingredients, extreme processing conditions (high homogenization pressure or/and cycles) are needed to produce nanocrystals. For example, the andrographolide nanocrystals with particle sizes of 476 nm could only prepared under 1200 bar for 30 cycles (Chen et al., 2018), and quercetin nanocrystals with particle sizes of 483 nm were produced under 1500 bar for 20 cycles (Sahoo et al., 2011). The resulting particle sizes in other studies are often above 100 nm. Therefore, research on the production of nanocrystals with small particle sizes (especially below 100 nm) by HPH is rare (Salazar et al., 2014; Park et al., 2018). Considering that particle size has a significant impact on solubility, and thereby on the oral bioavailability (Ren et al., 2019), production of nanocrystals with small particle sizes is urgently needed. In this study, puerarin, mainly used as a therapeutic agent to treat cardiovascular diseases (including myocardial ischemia, hypertension and so on), was employed as the model drug. In our previous works, we confirmed that the bioavailability of puerarin increased as particle sizes decreased (Tu et al., 2013; Yi et al., 2015). Herein, we intended to construct nanocrystals with ultra-small particle sizes (below 50 nm) by formulation of hydrogen bonds between the molecules, utilizing attractive force stronger than electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces, which normally exist between drug and stabilizers. Our hypothesis was that stronger attractive forces between the drug and stabilizer are expected to connect molecules closer and faster during the production process, resulting in a stabilization effect at early aggregation of nanocrystals, leading to ultra-small particle sizes. We developed a new HPH process to manufactured nanocrystals and characterized them in vitro and investigated the absorption mechanisms. This was followed by the in vivo characterization of the pharmacokinetic performance and therapeutic effect in a myocardial ischemia model. Fig. 1 illustrates the scheme of study."

3,Preparation and characterization of Pue-NCs,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of Pue-NCs Pue-NCs were prepared by high pressure homogenization (HPH). Briefly, 10.0% (w/v) puerarin was added into 20.0% (w/v) PVP K30-water solution and processed by high pressure homogenizer (AH-NANO, ATS Engineering Inc., Canada) at 700 bar for 10 cycles to obtain Pue-NCs. The parameters used are shown in Table 1 . The characterization of prepared nanocrystals was further investigated using the following methods: The particle sizes of the samples were determined by Dynamic light scattering (DLS), using PSS. particle sizing systems (PSS, America) and the particle sizes were presented as D90 (90% particles below this size). The hydrogen bonds were detected by Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra, performing on spectrometer (AVANCE III HD 600, Bruker, Switzerland) and Fourier Transform infrared spectra (FTIR), recorded using FTIR spectrophotometer (Spectrum Two, PerkinElmer, America). The morphology of puerarin nanocrystals (Pue-NCs) were studied either by S-4800 Field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan) or JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, Japan). The crystalline state of the sample was conducted by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-2550V, Rigaku Co., Japan) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, 2910 MDSC V4.4E, TA Analysis, Japan). The saturation solubility was studied by adding excess puerarin in water and 20% (w/v) PVP K30 water solution, or adding excess Pue-NCs in water, and then shaking at 37 °C for 24 h. After the equilibrium state was reached, the aliquots were filtered through 0.22 µm filters, and then diluted by methanol before HPLC analysis. Puerain (coarse puerarin), mixture (puerain and PVP K30 mixture was dissolved in water and then freeze-dried) and Pue-NCs (freeze-dried powder) were used in dissolution study. Powders (equivalent to 50 mg of puerarin) were weighed accurately and filled into 0 # gelatin capsules and then performed at 37 °C in 900 mL of water under 100 rpm by using basket method. Ten milliliters of samples were harvested at pre-set time and filtered through 0.22 µm filters immediately before HPLC analysis."
4,Stability studies,"2.3 Stability studies The stability of Pue-NCs was performed in both liquid state and solid state. In liquid state, the nanocrystals were suspended in water and stored at 25 °C for 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 month, while in solid state, the nanocrystals prepared in above section were solidified by freezing drying or spray drying and then stored at 25 °C for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 month. The freezing drying condition were: Samples were pre-frozen under −20 °C for 4 h, and lyophilized (MODULYOD, Thermo, USA) at −45 °C for 24 h. The spray drying was performed at spray dryer (SD-06AG, Labplant, UK) under a pre-set inlet temperature (180 °C) and inlet sample rate (2 mL/min). The particle sizes of solid nanocrystals were measured after redispersed the nanocrystals in water, and the redispersion process has no significant influence on the particle sizes of nanocrystals. The particle sizes were monitored at the pre-set time points throughout this study."
5,Transport across the Caco-2 cell monolayers,"2.4 Transport across the Caco-2 cell monolayers Caco-2 cell model was used to evaluate the absorption mechanisms of Pue-NCs. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acid, and inclubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After dilution into a suitable concentration, Caco-2 cells were added to the apical side (AP) of a transwell chamber at 2 × 105 cells/well. 0.5 mL culture media was added to apical side (AP), while that of basolateral side (BP) was 1.5 mL, and then the culture media was replaced every two days for the first week and everyday thereafter. To obtain a fine cell monolayer, Caco-2 cells were cultured for about 21 days until the transepithelial electrical resistance reached to above 400 Ω·cm−2. Prior to the experiment, the cell monolayer was washed by 37 °C HBSS three times, and then 0.5 mL HBSS with different formulations was added to AP side, meanwhile, 1.5 mL blank HBSS was added to BP side. After incubation for 1 h and 2 h, 0.5 mL medium was taken from BP side and replaced with preheated HBSS. The puerarin concentrations in the medium was assayed by HPLC after dilution with methanol. A series of drug concentrations (equivalent to puerarin, 200 µg/mL and 1, 15 mg/mL, dispersed in water for nanocrystals, while dispersed in 0.1% (w/v) CMS-Na for puerarin) were set to investigate the effects of drug concentration on the cellular transport mechanism. The transport direction, effects of micropinocytosis-mediated endocytosis, effects of stabilizers, P-gp efflux and temperature (37 °C and 4 °C) were also conducted. The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of each group were compared through the study, and were calculated according to the following equation. P a p p = dQ dt × 1 A × C 0 where dQ/dt is the transport amount of drug from donor side to acceptor side; A is the membrane area (cm2), and C0 is the initial concentration of drug in donor side."
6,Pharmacokinetic studies,"2.5 Pharmacokinetic studies A specific pathogen free grade male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was used for a pharmacokinetic study, and the animal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, Jiangxi University of TCM. The animals were kept at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C under natural light/dark conditions for 1 week and were given with food and water ad libitum. All the animals were kept fasting overnight before drug administration. Fifteen SD rats, weighting 250 ± 20 g, were divided into three groups. Puerarin suspension (dispersed 1%(w/v) puerarin into 2% (w/v) PVP K30-water solution, 100 mg/kg) and Pue-NCs (50 mg/kg) were administrated by gavage, while puerarin injection was intravenous administrated at 25 mg/kg. Blood samples (0.3 mL) were collected by retro-orbital puncture at 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 ,12, 24 h, after p.o. administration and 0, 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 h, after i.v. administration. The blood samples gathered were centrifugated at 4000 rpm for 10 min to gain plasma, and stored at −20 °C thereafter. To determine the puerarin concentration in plasma, P-hydroxybenzoic acid was employed as internal standard (IS). 20 µL IS solution, 100 µL plasma and 100 µL 5%(v/v) perchloric acid–methanol solution were mixed by vortexing for 3 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. 10 µL supernatants were injected into HPLC system to determine the drug concentration by using the HPLC conditions shown in section “HPLC analysis”."
7,Therapeutic effect of Pue-NCs on myocardial ischemia,"2.6 Therapeutic effect of Pue-NCs on myocardial ischemia Isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia model was employed for the experiment, and the animal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee, Jiangxi University of TCM. As reported in several works, the active mechanisms of puerarin to combat against myocardial ischemia were summarized to reducing the expression of CK, AST and MDA (Liu et al., 2019b) or AMPK/Akt/GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling pathway (Li et al., 2018) or anti-inflammatory (such as decreasing expression of TNF-α, mainly generated by monocytes and macrophages) (Liu et al., 2019a). So, in this paper, we mainly explore the reducing expression effect of formulations on the CK, AST and MDA in therapeutic studies. Amplitude of T waves were selected as physiological indicator, while Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA), α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) and Creatine Kinase (CK) were chosen as biochemical indicators. The SD rats, weighting 180–220 g, were randomly divided into five groups with 10 rats each group. The puerarin and Pue-NCs were suspended in water before administration. The scheme of the treatment was shown in Table 2 . Details are listed as follows: Group 1, control group (received water, p.o., and no other treatment); Group 2, negative group (received water, p.o., and isoprenaline, s.c.); Group 3, received puerarin, p.o., 50 mg/kg; Group 4, received Pue-NCs, p.o., 50 mg/kg; Group 5, received puerarin injection, i.v., 15 mg/kg. After administrating formulations or water for 7 days, the group 2, 3, 4 and 5 rats received isoprenaline (85 mg/kg, s.c.) at the 8th and 9th days (Tang et al., 2015; Darwesh et al., 2018), and meanwhile, the group 1 rats received salt water instead. After the treatments at the 8th days, the detection of electrocardiograms (T wave) was performed at 0, 1, 10 min and 24 h after administration of isoprenaline. The T wave amplitude (exhibiting as the highest amplitude of the T wave) (Hanninen et al., 2003) was measured by using Multi-channel physiological recorder analysis system (MP150, Biopac, America), and the decreasing ratio of T wave amplitude was calculated as the following equation. D e c r e a s i n g r a t i o = - T t T 0 × 100 % where Tt is T wave amplitude at pre-set times and T0 is T wave amplitude at 0 min. 24 h after the second injection of isoprenaline, the rats were administrated the formulations they received at the first 7 days. One hour after the administration, the rats were sacrificed and their blood samples were collected. The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) and creatine kinase (CK) were detected by using commercially available kits."
8,HPLC analysis,"2.7 HPLC analysis Puerarin concentrations in all samples (including plasma sample and cell sample) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the same condition as our work published (Tu et al., 2013). Briefly, determination was performed using an HPLC equipment (Shimadzu, Japan) consisting of a LC-20AT HPLC pump and an SPD-20A UV–VIS detector, under using of a Hypersil ODS2 C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 µm, Elite Analytical Instruments Co., China). The mobile phase was composed of methanol and 0.1% (w/v) citric acid–water solution at a volume ratio of 25:75, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. 250 nm and 30 °C were selected as the detection wavelength and column temperature, respectively."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the DAS 3.2 pharmacokinetics program (DAS 3.2.8 invented by the Clinical Trial Center of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China). All values were expressed as their mean ± SD. The statistical analysis was made by one-way ANOVA using SPSS Statistics 22.0 program. The differences were considered significant at p < 0.05."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Preparation of Pue-NCs by hydrogen bonds,"3.1 Preparation of Pue-NCs by hydrogen bonds 3.1.1 Preparation of ultra-small nanocrystals based on hydrogen bonds Pue-NCs with ultra-small particle sizes were produced by HPH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on preparation of nanocrystals based on hydrogen bonds via HPH. At first, a series of stabilizers with various physicochemical properties, e.g. polarity and polymer chain size, were introduced to prepare Pue-NCs. The stabilizer, such as PVP K30, which have a polar group and polymer chain could construct Pue-NCs with ultra-small particle sizes (about 20–40 nm), meanwhile, other stabilizers, such as SDS, PVA, HPMC and Poloxamer 188, which have no polar group or polymer chain could not gain Pue-NCs with ultra-small particle sizes (Fig. 2 A). Analyzing the chemical structures of puerarin and PVP K30, we found that several hydroxyl groups which may act as hydrogen bonds donor, were in the structure of puerarin, while in PVP K30 exist several amide groups (strong polar groups), may act as hydrogen bonds acceptor. We had hypnotized that hydrogen bonds might form between the hydroxy of puerarin and the amide group of PVP K30 (Fig. 2B). 3.1.2 Factors affecting the formation of hydrogen bonds The production temperature was employed as the factor affecting the formation of hydrogen bonds. We produced a series of nanocrystals under below 30 °C, 30–35 °C, 35–40 °C, 40–45 °C and above 45 °C, and regarded nanocrystals with particle sizes below 50 nm as successful samples. The successful rate was calculated as below: S u c c e s s f u l r a t e = A m o u n t o f s u c c e s s f u l e x p e r i m e n t s T o t a l a m o u n t o f e x p e r i m e n t s We found that successful nanocrystals could not form below 35 °C, and the successful production rate raised as production temperature increased (Fig. 3 A). With the increasing of production temperature, the thermal movements of polymer and nanocrystals increased, thus benefitted for the formation of hydrogen bonds. In addition, higher production temperature also benefits the distribution of polymer chain onto the surface of drug, and hence improving the stability and reducing particle sizes of nanocrystals. 3.1.3 Factors affecting the distribution of polymer chain The polymer/drug ratio and polymer chain length were selected for the distribution investigation of polymer chain. The effects of PVP/puerarin ratio on the formation of nanocrystals showed that insufficient or excess of polymer could decrease the success rate. Ultra-fine nanocrystals formed at a PVP/puerarin ratio at 2.0, with particle sizes of 20–40 nm (Fig. 3B). When the concentration of polymer was low, the polymer chain could not be completely adsorbed onto the drug surface, causing the aggregation of nanocrystals, however, when the concentration of polymer was very high, the polymer chain trends to be absorbed by two or more drug particles, and the nanocrystals are linked together by space bridging forces, thereby destabilizing the nanocrystals system (Mangal et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018b). A suitable polymer/drug ratio is needed to produce nanocrystals with good stability that will further influence the particle sizes of nanocrystals. To explore the effect of polymer chain length on the particle size of nanocrystals, a series of PVP with different chain length (molecular weight) were employed in this study. The molecular weight of PVP selected was about 3.5 k, 10.1 k, 37.9 k, 216.0 k and 630.0 k for PVP K12, PVP K17, PVP K30, PVP K60 and PVP K90, respectively. The results showed polymer with too small or too large molecular weight were insufficient in decreasing of particle size (Fig. 3C), revealing the polymer chain length was an essential factor for production of Pue-NCs. Too short chains could not complete cover the surface of drug nanocrystals, while too long chains trends to adsorbed by two or more drug particles, leading to an increasing of particle size (Chen and O’Mahony, 2016). As reported in previous works by others, to produce nanocrystals with small particle sizes by HPH, several combining techniques (e.g. NANOEDGE™ (Xu et al., 2012), H69™ (Sinha and Müller, 2013), H42™ (Salazar et al., 2013), H96™ (Salazar et al., 2012) and CT™ (Salazar et al., 2014) were invented, and the smallest nanocrystals was produced cavi-precipitation-HPH (H69™) with particle size about 22 nm, but organic solvent and extreme production condition (1500 bar) were used in the production process (Müller and Möschwitzer, 2009). Besides this study, there was no other report about producing nanocrystals with particle sizes below 100 nm (Salazar et al., 2014). Other attempts mainly focused on the effect of physicochemical properties (e.g. solubility, logP and hydrophobic data) of stabilizer and drug on the particle sizes of nanocrystals, but all failed to produce nanocrystals with small particle sizes (Eerdenbrugh et al., 2009; Verma et al., 2009; Yue et al., 2013, 2016; Xie et al., 2016). In this study, we prepare the ultra-small nanocrystals using hydrogen bonds between stabilizer and drug particles. Stronger attractive forces could connect drug and stabilizer closer and faster, thus inhibiting early aggregation of drug nanocrystals during the preparation process (Cravillon et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2012), hence, leading to nanocrystals with ultra-small particle sizes."
12,Confirmation of hydrogen bonds,"3.2 Confirmation of hydrogen bonds 1H NMR and FTIR were employed to further confirm the formation of hydrogen bonds. Comprehensive 1H NMR studies were initially carried out, and the results illustrated that no chemical structural change (or formation of new chemical bonds) has occurred in the physical mixture and nanocrystals manufacture (data shown in supporting information). Fig. 4 shows, puerarin and the physical mixture share the same infrared peaks at 3050–2800 cm−1, representing characteristic peaks of OH of puerarin, and 1800–1550 cm−1, caused by CC of puerarin. However, the infrared peaks of puerarin undergone changes during transformation into nanoscale. The peak at 1634 cm−1 for puerarin shifted to 1660 cm−1 in the nanocrystals, and no strict peaks were detected at 1610 cm−1, and 1570 cm−1 in the spectrum of nanocrystals, moreover, the peaks at 1800–1550 cm−1 and 3050–2800 cm−1 became stronger and wider for the nanocrystals. The increased wavenumber (or blue shift of peak for instead) may be explained as the hydrogen bonds formed acted shrinkage effect on CC bonds, leading to decreasing of bonds length. The hydrogen bonds can also increase the polarization degree of functional groups, e.g. CC and OH, hence, exhibiting stronger and wider infrared peaks."
13,Characterization of Pue-NCs,"3.3 Characterization of Pue-NCs The morphology of nanocrystals, made by HPMC, SDS and PVP K30, as stabilizers, were examined by SEM and TEM. HPMC and PVP K30 as stabilizers, appeared like spheroidal (Tu et al., 2013). However, the morphology of nanocrystals with SDS as stabilizer was rectangle-liked (Yi et al., 2015). In addition, the particle sizes of nanocrystals exhibited in SEM and TEM were similar with that of DLS (Fig. 5 ). The crystalline form of nanocrystals was studied by XRD and DSC, and Fig. 6 A shows the XRD patterns of puerarin and Pue-NCs at 2θ values between 10° and 80°. Several characteristic high-energy diffraction peaks appeared in the XRD curve of puerarin, indicating its crystalline structure. The crystallinity of puerarin slightly decreased during mixing with PVP K30, and almost disappeared during preparation of nanocrystals. The results of XRD revealed crystal transformation from crystalline state of puerarin to amorphous state of Pue-NCs. The observation was further confirmed by a DSC study. As shown in Fig. 6B, puerarin exhibited an endothermic peak at 234.55 °C, and after mixed with PVP K30, the endothermic peak was slight weaken, revealing decreased crystallinity of puerarin. Endothermic peak at 234.55 °C was not found in the DSC curve of Pue-NCs, showing the nanocrystals converted into the amorphous state. The saturation solubility and dissolution rate of puerarin and Pue-NCs were showed in Fig. 6C and D. The saturation solubility of puerarin was increased with the attending of PVP K30, and the solubility was further increased after transferred puerarin to nanocrystals. The dissolution rate of Pue-NCs was lower than puerarin coarse powder, which seems a conflict with the Ostwald Freundlich and Noyes–Whitney equations, however, after excluding the influence of drying process and PVP K30, the Pue-NCs exhibited higher dissolution rate than puerarin."
14,Stability of Pue-NCs,"3.4 Stability of Pue-NCs Particle size was employed as index to study the stability of Pue-NCs, in solid state or liquid state. The particle size of solid Pue-NCs was detected after dispersing them into water. During a 6 months study, the particle sizes of nanocrystals was unchanged, revealing stability in a liquid for more than 6 months (Fig. 7 A). After transforming them into solid state formulations, the nanocrystals were stable for 2 years (Fig. 7B)."
15,Transport of Pue-NCs across the Caco-2 cell monolayers,"3.5 Transport of Pue-NCs across the Caco-2 cell monolayers 3.5.1 Transport pathway of Pue-NCs The results are shown in Fig. 8 A and B. The Papp of puerarin and Pue-NCs in different concentrations were similar, and the Papp (BL → AP) and Papp (AP → BL) of puerarin and Pue-NCs had no significant difference. The results above confirmed that puerarin and Pue-NCs were transported across cell monolayer via passive transport. Micropinocytosis-mediated endocytosis pathway was also investigated, by employing colchicine as inhibitor. It can be seen in Fig. 8C, unchanged Papp and increased Papp were observed in puerarin and Pue-NCs, respectively, after adding colchicine, revealing the micropinocytosis- mediated endocytosis existed in the transport process of Pue-NCs. 3.5.2 Effect of P-gp efflux on transport of Pue-NCs To exclude the effect of stabilizer on the P-gp efflux, the transport experiments with or without stabilizer were conducted, and the results showed the stabilizer had no influence on drug transport (Fig. 8D). Fig. 9 E showed after adding verapamil, a P-gp efflux inhibitor, the Papp of puerarin was increased, while, that of Pue-NCs was not changed, revealing P-gp efflux has hindered the transport of puerarin across Caco-2 cell monolayer, but had no significant effect on the transport of Pue-NCs. 3.5.3 Effect of temperature on transport of Pue-NCs The results show the Papp of puerarin and Pue-NCs in 4 °C decreased, compared to that of in 37 °C, illustrating the temperature influenced the transport process (Fig. 8F). In addition, the Papp of Pue-NCs was higher than the Papp of puerarin, as shown in all experiments operated in Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Nanocrystals are generally assumed to dissolve faster than coarse drugs, thus forming higher drug concentration gradient, leading improved absorption in gastrointestinal. Under this knowledge, the volume of water in intestinal, excluding the effects of pH, bile salts and emptying time, influences the dissolution and subsequently, oral absorption of drugs, however, the water content in intestinal tract is highly variable depending on the physiological/pathological conditions and/or fasting/fed state (Lu et al., 2019). It was reported that in human volunteers, the fasted stomach contained about 35 mL of resting water, and the intestinal contained about around 77 mL water distributed into 16 pockets of 5 mL each. Meanwhile, after drinking 240 mL water, the gastric water volume declined rapidly with half emptying time of 13 min (Mudie et al., 2014). So, particular transport pathways of nanocrystals seem to exist in the intestinal tract. The endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi and Golgi/plasma membrane pathways in the transcytosis and exocytosis were found in the transport processes of paclitaxel nanocrystals (about 200 nm) (Deng et al., 2017), coumarin 6 nanocrystals (about 70 nm and 200 nm) (Miao et al., 2016) and lovastatin nanocrystals (about 400 nm) (Guo et al., 2019), and M cell uptake pathway was also found in the transport process of nanocrystals (Xie et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2017). Moreover, a caveolin-mediated endocytosis pathway was also found (Deng et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011). However, generally pathways or mechanisms of nanocrystals uptake are still unclear. For example, some researchers reported that nanocrystals could be taken up via micropinocytosis-mediated endocytosis pathway(Guo et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2013; Rabinow et al., 2007), but other researches did not observe this pathway (Deng et al., 2017; Miao et al., 2016), besides, no passive transport was found on nanocrystals with particle sizes above 70 nm, and whether this pathway may exist for nanocrystals below 50 nm is still unknown. In our study, we found the major transport mechanism for puerarin was passive transport, meanwhile, for Pue-NCs, with particle size about 20–40 nm, the passive transport and micropinocytosis-mediated endocytosis coexisted (Sugano et al., 2010)."
16,Pharmacokinetic study,"3.6 Pharmacokinetic study The blood concentration-time curves of puerarin suspension and nanocrystals after oral administration in rats and their pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Fig. 9, Table 3 . The results show that Cmax and AUC of puerarin were increased for Pue-NCs. The Cmax and AUC of nanocrystals were enhanced 2.36 and 11.54 folds, respectively. The increased Cmax can be explained a higher saturation solubility in digestive juice owing to its reduced particle size (Hecq et al., 2005; Brough et al., 2013), thus leading to a higher drug concentration gradient between gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and blood which markedly improved absorption. The increased saturation solubility is generally considered to contribute to enhanced AUC (Sawant et al., 2015; Kesisoglou et al., 2007), and the decreased particle sizes is considered to tend to enhanced permeability and cell uptake, thus enhancing bioavailability (Liu et al., 2018a; Yu et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017)."
17,Therapeutic effect of Pue-NCs on myocardial ischemia,"3.7 Therapeutic effect of Pue-NCs on myocardial ischemia After injected isoproterenol for 1 min, the amplitude of T waves was decreased by about 61% for the negative group, while that of puerarin group, Pue-NCs group and injection group was 58%, 19% and 30%, respectively. The decreased T waves trended to restore within 24 h after administration, and the decreased ratio of T waves was about 26%, −11% and 8% for puerarin group, Pue-NCs group and injection group, respectively, at 24 h, meanwhile, that of model group was 40% (Fig. 10 B). These results revealed that the Pue-NCs and injection could hinder and restore the decreasing of T wave in myocardial ischemia. No significant difference was found in the decreasing ratio of T wave between rats in the Pue-NCs group and injection group. Increased release of AST, MDA, α-HBDH and CK, and decreased release of LDH were observed in negative group, revealing that a myocardial ischemia was successfully established. After administration of puerarin (50 mg/kg), Pue-NCs (50 mg/kg) and puerarin injection (15 mg/kg), the release of biochemical indicators studied became closer to that of control group than negative group. The effect of both Pue-NCs and injection on decreasing the release of AST, MDA, α-HBDH, CK, and increasing the release of LDH were larger than that of puerarin. No significant differences of release of all biochemical indicators was found between Pue-NCs and puerarin injection. The results showed that puerarin has therapeutic effect for myocardial ischemia, and the therapeutic effect can be enhanced when transforming puerarin into Pue-NCs. Therapeutic equivalence was demonstrated between Pue-NCs (50 mg/kg, p.o.) and puerarin injection (15 mg/kg, i.v.)."
18,Conclusion,"In this study, a novel production strategy for nanocrystals with ultra-small particle sizes (<50 nm) was developed, and we confirmed the existence of hydrogen bonds by 1H NMR and FTIR. The results of SEM and TEM showed that the distribution of polymer chains onto drug particles benefited the formation of nanocrystals. The studies with Caco-2 cell monolayers showed that the major transport mechanism for puerarin was passive transport, meanwhile, for Pue-NCs, the passive transport and micropinocytosis-mediated endocytosis coexisted. The absolute bioavailability of Pue-NCs was 35.28%, which was 11.54 folds higher to that of puerarin. In addition, the Pue-NCs and puerarin injection gained therapeutic equivalence for myocardial ischemia at dosage of 50 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively. In conclusion, formation of hydrogen bonds was found to be an efficient strategy for production of ultra-small nanocrystals and the ultra-small nanocrystals can increase bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency."
