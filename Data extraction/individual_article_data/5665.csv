0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the depletion of fossil resources and increasing CO2 emission problems pushed the scholars to focus on developing renewable biomass resources to reduce the dependence on fossil resources [1]. Among bio-based chemicals, Levulinic acid (LA) and its esters, were considered as one of the most important lignocellulosic derived materials and a kind of versatile biomass platform molecules [2]. γ-valerolactone (GVL), which could be obtained by the catalytic hydrogenation of LA, had been identified as one of the most alluring platform molecules which was a sustainable commodity chemical and had tremendous potential as a biofuel due to its combustion properties. Therefore, generating GVL from biomass had drawn an increasing attention. Recently, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) process had been regarded as an attractive approach for energy-saving and cost-effective method in comparison to the former hydrogenation that needed high-pressure and flammable H2 using precious metal catalysts [3,4]. Among several hydrogen donors (H-donors) used in the CTH process, 2-BuOH [5] and i-PrOH [6–9] that belonged to secondary alcohols were widely used because they were less corrosive, non-toxic and no greenhouse gas (CO2) release compared to formic acid [10,11] and methanol [12,13]. Dumesic et al. firstly reported a viable and green process called CTH for quantitative yields of GVL using secondary alcohols as H-donor over heterogeneous catalysts ZrO2 in 150 °C for 16 h [14]. After that, more and more Zr-based heterogeneous catalysts had been reported [15–19]. Although many noble and non-noble catalysts were studied to facilitate this hydrogenation process under H2, there were very short of researches on catalyst use in the CTH process, and only Ru [8,9], Pd [20], Ni [21,22] and Cu [6] were investigated. Nevertheless, the use of costly Ru and Pd made against to the aim of producing low price liquid transportation fuels, and cheap Ni was a heavy metal with high toxicity that limited their large-scale application to a certain degree. Thus, to develop a low-cost and high-activity catalyst that could be industrial application was significant. Recently, nano copper had attracted research attention because of its excellent performance in the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process [23,24]. However, supported Cu catalysts were used rarely in this CTH process to produce GVL up to now. Ge et al. performed a CTH process of Methyl levulinate (ML) over Cu-ZrO2 catalyst to afford 75% yield of GVL, but its cyclic stability was bad because of inevitable leaching of copper particles [6]. Hence, moderate GVL yield and selectivity and the difficulty of reusing impeded the catalyst application. To this end, it was urgent to explore a nano Cu-based catalyst with high activity and stability to solve problems mentioned above. Herein, an effective ternary Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst which was prepared by co-precipitation method and could be sustainably used was explored for CTH process of ethyl levulinate (EL) to produce GVL under mild condition with i-PrOH as H-donor (Scheme 1 ). Comparing with the binary Cu/ZnO and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, the influence of different support oxides was explored both in the catalytic performance and in the structure of catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental materials,"2.1 Experimental materials EL (ethyl levulinate, 99%) as the initial reactant was purchased from Beijing inoke Technology Co. Ltd. AR grade Cu(NO3)2•3H2O, Zn(NO3)2•6H2O, Al(NO3)3•9H2O and Na2CO3 were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Ternary Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) catalysts with Cu/Zn/Al molar ratio of 6/3/1 were prepared by the coprecipitation method on the basis of procedure reported by Baltes C [25]. In a general procedure, metal nitrates [(Cu(NO3)2 (0.6 mol/L), Zn(NO3)2 (0.3 mol/L), Al(NO3)3 (0.1 mol/L))] were dissolved together as the corresponding solutions, and a mixed solution Na2CO3 (1 mol/L) was prepared as the precipitating agent. Typically, two solutions were dumped together into 200 mL of deionized water under continuously stirring and maintained at 70 °C with a constant pH (± 0.1 unit) = 7, controlled by Mettler-Toledo FiveEasy Plus™ (FE20), after the coprecipitation stopped and then aging for 1 h. After that, the obtained slurry was filtered and washed with deionized water, then dried overnight at 80 °C and finally calcined at a specific temperature for 3 h under air after grounding to obtain CZA precursors. The CZA precursors were denoted by their calcination temperature as CZAO-3, CZAO-4, CZAO-5, CZAO-6 and CZAO-7 at 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C, respectively. Ultimately, CZA catalysts were obtained when the precursors were reduced with a 5% H2/Ar mixture at 300 °C for 3 h in a tubular furnace. And they were denoted by their corresponding precursors, such as CZA-3, CZA-4, CZA-5, CZA-6 and CZA-7. For comparison, binary Cu/ZnO (CZ) catalyst with Cu/Zn atomic ratio of 6/4 and binary Cu/Al2O3 (CA) catalyst with Cu/Al atomic ratio of 6/4 were prepared by the coprecipitation method mentioned above, respectively. Their precursors were obtained after calcined at 300 °C for 3 h under air, which were denoted as CZO and CAO, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained by LabX XRD-6100 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 nm) and the 2θ angle in the range of 10°–80° at a speed of 6 °/min. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) mesopore and Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) microspore size distribution were determined by static nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique on a Autosorb-iQ-TPX, Quantachrome, USA after the catalysts were degassed at 120 °C under vacuum for at least 12 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were taken on a */JEOL JSM-7800F Prime Super resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (ER-SEM) to elucidate the morphology and microstructure of the catalysts. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done with */JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy to observe the microscopic particle shape and size of catalysts. Hydrogen-temperature-programmed reduction (H2–TPR) experiments were conducted on an Autosorb-iQ-TPX, Quantachrome, USA to determine the reducibility of different copper oxides of the catalysts."
5,Typical experiment and product analysis,"2.4 Typical experiment and product analysis All the experiments were performed in a 5 mL glass vessel covered with a Teflon top that could bear high pressure. Firstly, feedstock, catalyst and solvent were loaded into the reactor, then a certain N2 was filled in and the vessel was sealed. After that, it was put onto magnetic stirring apparatus at the desired reaction temperature for a certain time. Finally, after reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, liquid samples were collected and filtered with a 0.22 μm membrane, and the following was to analyze by GC-FID (Gas chromatography with flame ionization detector, Agilent GC7890A) and GC–MS (Gas chromatography with mass spectrometer, Agilent GC7890A- MS5975C) equipped with HP-Innowax column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). As for the solid samples, they were collected and washed with deionized water for several times for XRD analysis and then kept in ethanol for subsequent analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization XRD patterns of Cu particle with different support oxides were shown in Fig. 1 (a). The peaks of Cu were in the 2θ ranges of 42.0°–42.5°, 48.5°–52.0° and 73.5°–75.0°. The strong diffraction peaks of Cu particles were detected in CA catalysts, but no diffraction peaks of Al2O3 were detected which might be due to its amorphous phase [26]. Both the diffraction peaks of Cu and ZnO particles were observed in CZ catalysts. But only the diffraction peaks of Cu were detectable when the Al2O3 was put together with Cu and ZnO as a composition of the CZA-3 catalysts, which suggested that the addition of Al2O3 might increase the dispersion of ZnO and reduce its crystallinity [26,27]. The FWHMs of the peak of Cu in 42.0°–42.5° of CA, CZ and CZA-3 calculated by XRD diffraction patterns were 0.521, 0.584 and 0.674. Then, crystallite sizes of Cu in CA, CZ and CZA-3 were calculated by XRD diffraction patterns using Scherrer Equation [26,28,29], which were 18.5 nm, 15.4 nm and 12.7 nm, respectively (see Table 1 ). When the atomic ratios of Cu in three catalysts were constant (60%), a gradual decrease in crystallite size of Cu indicated the dispersion of Cu had been remarkably enhanced in CZA-3 [25,28–30], which might be due to the presence of ZnO and Al2O3 as a binary support. And that was agreement with the conclusions in the literatures [30,31]. The structural properties of the different catalysts were shown in Table 1. The BET surface areas of CZA-3, CZ and CA were 56.4 m2/g, 40.6 m2/g and 114.9 m2/g, respectively. The order of BET surface area was found to be CA > CZA-3 > CZ, and the order of crystallite size of Cu was found to be CA > CZ > CZA-3. Based on the data of BET and crystallite size of Cu, it illustrated that the addition of Al2O3 might effectively improve the overall surface area of the catalyst, and the presence of ZnO might be helpful to get Cu particles with smaller crystallite size. Therefore, it seemed that Al2O3 and ZnO effectively regulated the specific surface area and the crystallite size of Cu in the catalysts. The SEM images of CZA-3 catalyst were shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), and EDX mapping micrographs of synthesized nanocatalysts were displayed in Fig. 1(e). Generally, small particles were observed in Fig. 1(d). In addition, nothing particularly different between CZ sample (see Figs. SI-1(a) and (b)), CA sample (see Figs. SI-1(c) and (d)) and CZA-3 could be found from the SEM images. The EDX mapping micrograph of CZA-3 in Fig. 1(e) exhibited uniform dispersion of Cu, Zn, Al and O elements. The EDX mapping micrographs of CZ (see Fig. SI-1(g)) and CA (see Fig. SI-1(h)) exhibited uniform dispersion of Cu, Zn, O and Cu, Al, O elements, respectively. From TEM micrographs, it was obvious that the morphology and particle size of CZA-3 (see Fig. 1(b)), CZ (see Fig. SI-1(e)) and CA (see Fig. SI-1(f)) were different. CZA-3 had the uniform particle size mostly about 20 nm. Fig. SI-1(e) showed the microstructure of CZ which had the size from 10 nm to 30 nm. As shown in Fig. SI-1(f), the particles of CA were not well shaped and several particles also stuck together. Thus, CZA-3 had the more uniform and homogeneous particles than CZ and CA [26]. The HRTEM images of CZA-3 were presented in Fig. 2 . The interplanar distances were measured and annotated in the corresponding position. The Cu particles were in contact with several ZnO particles. It seemed that ZnO particles serve as spacers between Cu particles which probably prevented Cu particles from sintering [26]. Because the Al2O3 was amorphous, there was no clear lattice stripe displayed, and it might be in the place where the stripes were unclear [26,28,32]. The results of H2-TPR measurements were shown in Fig. 3 . According to the literatures, the reduction of CZAO-3 could be proceeded in three steps [33,34]. The curves of CZAO-3 and CZO were deconvoluted into 3 reduction peaks by the Guassian-type function. The three different intensity bands were at 170 –200 °C, 200–220 °C and 220–250 °C, respectively. That could correspond to the reduction of three kinds of Cu2+ into Cu, such as highly dispersed CuO particles (peaks 1 and 4), bulk CuO with ZnO contact (peaks 2 and 4) and bulk CuO without ZnO contact (peaks 3 and 6). The temperatures of reduction peaks of CZAO-3 were a little bit higher than that of CZO. Comparing with the high-temperature peak represented bulk CuO without ZnO contact, peak 3 of CZAO-3 was much lower than peak 6 of CZO. It could be speculated that the addition of Al2O3 increased the interaction between CuO and ZnO [35]. On the other hand, the curves of CAO were more complicated, and they were deconvoluted into five reduction peaks, while the peaks 7 and 8 correspond to highly dispersed CuO particles and bulk CuO with Al2O3 contact, respectively. And the peaks (temperature >250 °C) 9,10 and 11, correspond to large CuO particles [36]. It was obvious that CAO was much more difficult to be reduced without the addition of ZnO. Therefore, ZnO/Al2O3 as a binary support might intense the metal-support interaction of CZA-3, which might have an influence on the enhanced reducibility of copper [34,37]. Calcination temperature was essentially important for the formation of nondecomposed Cu/Zn hydroxy carbonate residues in the calcined precursors [25], which had strong influence on the Cu NPs and the metal-support interaction after H2 reduction [37]. Therefore, a series of CZA catalysts under different calcination temperatures were prepared to investigate the effect on the morphologies and the catalytic activities of the finally resulted samples. XRD patterns of a series of CZA catalysts calcined at different temperatures were shown in Fig. SI-2. The peaks of Cu were observed in all samples, and the intensity of peaks increased with the increase of calcination temperature, especially for the CZA-7 sample, which meant the higher crystallinity and/or the sintering of Cu particles. Besides, the peaks of ZnO catalysts were not obvious in CZA-3, CZA-4 and CZA-5, which illustrated the low crystallinity of ZnO. However, the peaks of ZnO could be observed prominently in CZA-6 and CZA-7, which indicated that high temperature could promote crystallization of ZnO particles. As for Al2O3, no diffraction peaks were exhibited in all samples, indicating its amorphous nature and/or high dispersion [26]. The Cu crystallite sizes of CZA-3 and CZA-7 calculated by XRD diffraction patterns using Scherrer Equation were 12.7 nm and 23.5 nm, respectively. It was consistent with the crystallite size and BET surface area results of corresponding CZAO precursors (see Table SI-1), and the CuO crystallite sizes of CZAO-3 and CZAO-7 were 5.8 nm and 20.4 nm, respectively. On the other hand, with the increase of calcination temperature, the BET surface area of catalyst precursors had been decreasing from 125.5 m2/g (CZAO-3) to 26.7 m2/g (CZAO-7). Apparently, CZAO-3 had the smallest CuO crystallite size and the largest BET surface area. Besides, since the surface area largely decreased to about 26 m2/g in CZAO-7, it seemed that high calcination temperature caused the collapse of porous structure of catalyst. From the SEM images of CZA catalysts in Fig. SI-3, it seemed that bigger cluster could be seen in CZA-7 catalyst. The EDX mapping micrograph of CZA catalysts in Fig. SI-4 exhibited uniform dispersion of Cu, Zn, Al and O elements and no particular difference could be found. The photographs of TEM indicated that CZA-6 and CZA-7 had larger particle size (see Fig. SI-5(a) and (b)), and had much different morphology compared to CZA-3. Regarding to above descriptions, it could be assumed that high temperature calcination resulted in sintering and recrystallization of copper and the collapse of porous structure."
8,Catalytic activity of various catalysts for the EL conversion,"3.2 Catalytic activity of various catalysts for the EL conversion The catalytic activities of CZA-3, CZ, CA and other catalysts were characterized for CTH process as shown in Table 2 . In the initial tests, the blank test showed that it was not possible to covert EL to GVL using i-PrOH as H-donor without any catalyst (entry 1). Notably, 90.7% conversion of EL and 88.6% yield of GVL were observed when CZA-3 as a catalyst was used (entry 2). The yields of GVL were 82.4% and 58.9% over CZ and CA, respectively. Compared the results of CZ with CA, the EL conversion of 90.5% over CZ was much higher than 65.7% over CA (entries 3 and 4). Since the crystallite sizes of Cu in CA, CZ were 18.5 nm and 15.4 nm, respectively, it seemed that the smaller crystallite size of Cu was a reason for the higher activity of CZ to facilitate the conversion of EL. On the other hand, compared the results of CZA-3 with CZ (entries 2 and 3), the EL conversion was almost the same, but the GVL yield of 88.6% over CZA-3 was higher than 82.4% over CZ. Besides, it could be seen that CZA-3 showed the superior catalytic activity and GVL selectivity of 97.7% was obtained compared to the catalysts of CZ (91%) and CA (89.6%). In addition, GC-FID photographs of solutions catalyzed by CZA-3 and CZ were shown in Fig. SI-6, and the peaks of EL of two catalysts were almost the same, but the peak of GVL of CZA-3 was a little higher, and another peak at retention time ranging from 10.0 to 10.1 min which might be an intermediate was much smaller than that of CZ. It seemed that the addition of Al2O3 made CZA-3 own the smaller crystallite size of 12.7 nm and the highest dispersion of metallic Cu mentioned before, which probably increased the activity of CZA-3 by accelerating the transformation of intermediate to GVL. To highlight the best performance of ternary catalyst of CZA-3, other catalysts such as ZnO, Al2O3, Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 and skeletal Cu were also examined (entries 5–8). The results illustrated that single ZnO or Al2O3 did not exhibit catalytic activity for the transformation. However, all of CZA-3, CZ and CA with ZnO and/or Al2O3 as support had catalytic activity, indicating that the active species in the catalysts was metallic Cu. The use of Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 gave 34.2% yield (entry 7) and skeletal Cu afforded 65.9% yield (entry 8). Several other Cu-based catalysts such as nanoporous copper catalyst CuNPore, Cu powder, CuO, Cu/ZrO2, Cu/SiO2, CuAlZn-alloy and Cu/MgO were also tested, however, no GVL was detected. In addition, nanoporous nickel catalyst NiNPore and catalyst Pd/C which had been widely used in the hydrogenation field were attempted, however it seemed that they could not trigger this reaction. Therefore, CZA-3 was chosen to follow the optimization to obtain higher yield of GVL. It was reported that synthesized CZA catalysts from different calcination temperatures had different morphological structures, and the surface properties and the active phase dispersion directly affected catalytic activity [38]. Thus, a series of CZA catalysts including CZA-4, CZA-5, CZA-6 and CZA-7 prepared in different calcination temperatures were tested for the CTH reaction (entries 9–12). As a result, the yield of GVL was significantly affected by CZA catalysts in different calcination temperatures. Obviously, CZA-3 had the best performance compared to others. The catalytic activity of CZA-4, CZA-5 and CZA-6 decreased a little than CZA-3, but CZA-7 as a catalyst only gave 1.4% yield of GVL (entry 12). Based on the BET results and crystallite size in Table SI-1, it assumed that the larger size of Cu crystallites and the collapse of porous structure might be two main reasons for CZA-7 deactivation at the high calcination temperature."
9,The effect of the various parameters,"3.3 The effect of the various parameters To clarify the effect of CZA-3 loading for CTH reaction, the experiments were carried out and the results were shown in Fig. 4 . When CZA-3 loading increased from 10 mg to 60 mg, the conversion of EL increased from 70.0% to 97.9% and the yield of GVL up to 92.65% was obtained at 30 mg. However, only a small extent of increase of 1.65% was obtained when CZA-3 loading was 60 mg. From the proposed mechanism of CTH reaction of EL over CZA-3 discussed in Scheme 2 later, dehydrogenation of i-PrOH occurred, and then hydrogen and acetone were produced [8,9,22]. Here, it was found that the hydrogen pressure increased with the increase of catalyst amount. Considering the economic problem, 30 mg of CZA-3 was used in further study. Next, the influences of reaction time and temperature were investigated. The reaction was conducted over CZA-3 at 120 °C and 140 °C for different reaction times of 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h (see Fig. 5 (a)). At 140 °C, EL could be converted rapidly from 0.5 h to 1 h, and EL conversion of 96.7% and GVL yield of 96.0% were achieved when time was 1 h. The optimal condition was 140 °C for 2 h to achieve quantitative conversion of EL and 99.0% yield of GVL. In addition, it could be seen that increasing reaction temperature or time could increase H2 production and the GVL yield obviously (see Fig. 5 and Fig. SI-7). From the results above, it seemed to be a positive correlation between the amount of hydrogen and the yield of GVL. Considering the temperature tolerance of high pressure glass containers, the experiment at higher than 140 °C was not conducted."
10,Reusability of the CZA-3 catalyst,"3.4 Reusability of the CZA-3 catalyst Since the lifetime of the catalyst had vital influence on economic benefit of whole reaction, the CZA-3 catalyst was recycled for several times to assess the reusability and stability. In Fig. 6 , it could be observed that CZA-3 showed high reusability even after repeated four times without the loss of catalytic activity, and the yield kept almost unchanged in 99% with CZA-3 fresh and in 98% with CZA-3 after reused four times. Furthmore, ICP analysis of the solution after the reaction illustrated that the stripping phenomenon of CZA-3 was negligible in the light of the concentration of Cu; Zn and Al were too small to be detected (see Table SI-2, entry 1). To check the stability of the catalyst, CZA-3 was recovered after each CTH reaction and characterized by XRD. CZA-3 reused four times was characterized by BET, SEM, EDX and TEM. The comparative study of the SEM and TEM morphology between fresh CZA-3 (see Fig. 1(b)–(d)) and CZA-3 after reused four times (CZA-3R) (see Fig. 7 (a)–(c)) illustrated that CZA-3R seemed to be rather similar with CZA-3. On the other hand, the element distributions of Cu, Zn, Al and O were still uniform (see Fig. 7(d)). Crystallite size of Cu calculated by XRD patterns just had little change (12.7 nm, 12.2 nm, 12.6 nm, 13.7 nm and 14.0 nm) (see Fig. SI-8(a)), which did not have much influence on catalytic performance. Besides, CZA-3R had the superior surface area of 60.4 m2/g compared to CZA-3 of 56.4 m2/g, indicating that there was no collapse of porous structure, which might contribute to maintain the high catalytic activity of the CZA-3R (see Table SI-3). According to the characterization results above, the surface morphology and internal structure of CZA-3R did not change a lot in comparison to the fresh one. Thus, it was proved that CZA-3 had good stability and sustainability. To explore the role of Al2O3 in the CZA-3 catalysts, the reusability of CZ catalysts was also tested in the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, the activity of CZ catalyst decreased after subsequent reuse four times and the yield of GVL changed from 93.3% to 70.2%. In Fig. SI-8(b), the XRD patterns of the CZ catalyst after reuse four times indicated that the crystallite size of Cu grew from 15.1 nm to 17.9 nm and the crystallite size of ZnO grew from 9.4 nm to 12.5 nm. It seemed that the sintering of Cu after reused several times at high temperature might be one of the reasons of deactivation of catalyst [39]. Since the phenomenon of Cu sintering of CZA-3 was obvious less than that of CZ, it indicated that Al2O3 had improved the thermal stability and sustainability of CZA-3 to maintain the catalytic activity, which was consistent with the previous studies [28,31]."
11,Scopes of H-donors and raw materials,"3.5 Scopes of H-donors and raw materials There was no doubt that H-donors were very important for the CTH reaction. Among various primary and secondary alcohols estimated, only the secondary alcohols such as i-PrOH and 2-BuOH exhibited better performance, and similar yields of 99.0% and 97.2% were obtained, respectively (see Table 3 , entries 1 and 2). On the other hand, primary alcohols were observed to have negative performances for the CTH reaction (entries 3–6). Moreover, Methyl levulinate and propyl levulinate were detected in the solution by GC-MS with MeOH or EtOH as H-donor, respectively, indicating that the transesterification reaction occurred instead of hydrocyclization of EL. What was interesting was that only cyclohexanol, EL, cyclohexanone and a little amount of GVL were detected when cyclohexanol was used as H-donor, indicating that EL was converted into the cyclohexanone (entry 6). The feedstock such as LA and its ester ML were also carried out (see Table 3, entries 7 and 8). The results showed that CZA-3 had a good performance for the CTH reaction of ML to obtain 97% yield of GVL. When LA was used as a feedstock, it was ineffective to transform to GVL and isopropyl levulinate was generated, indicating that the transesterification reaction occurred rather than CTH reaction. The ICP analysis of the solution illustrated that the concentrations of Cu, Zn and Al were 17.79 ppm, 195.6 ppm and 48.45 ppm, respectively, which indicated that the support of CZA-3 was destroyed by LA which was probably responsible for the trace yield of GVL (see Table SI-2, entry 2)."
12,The proposed mechanism of CTH reaction of EL over CZA-3,"3.6 The proposed mechanism of CTH reaction of EL over CZA-3 To figure out the mechanism of this CTH reaction, the liquid phase after the reaction was measured by GC chromatogram, and acetone as the product of dehydrogenation of i-PrOH and ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate were detected in Fig. 8 (a). In addition, the gas phase was also collected after the reaction, and an obvious H2 peak was detected by GC-TCD as shown in Fig. 8(b). It was obvious that dehydrogenation of i-PrOH occurred to produce hydrogen and acetone [8,9,22], and the results verified that the pathway of CTH was the metal hydride route which was different from direct hydrogen transfer (Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley, MPV mechanism) [40]. The obtained concentration of acetone was used to calculate H2 pressure through the state equation of ideal gas (PV = nRT, T = 298 K). Meanwhile, in order to confirm the intermediate of this CTH process, GC-Fid photographs of solutions after different time reactions at 140 °C mentioned at Section 3.3 were studied. As shown in Fig. 9 , two obvious peaks ranging from 9.9 to 10.0 min and 11.2 to 11.3 min were observed by GC chromatogram which could be confirmed as ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate and 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO), respectively. However, a peak ranging from 9.8 to 9.9 min appeared obviously at a prolong time, it could not be detected by GC/MS because of its small quantity. With the increase of reaction time, the peak of ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate decreased until disappearing, but the peak of 1,4-PDO increased. Obviously, ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate was an intermediate of the reaction and 1,4-PDO was a byproduct which was obtained from further hydrogenation of GVL [17,41,42]. According to our results and previous studies [22,40,43], the pathway for the CTH reaction of EL over CZA-3 was proposed as shown in Scheme 2. Firstly, a surface alkoxy group was generated when the OH bond of i-PrOH was absorbed on CZA-3 surface. Then, β-H elimination happened to produce acetone and two Cu-H active species of CTH process formed. The active H species hydrogenated acetyl group to obtain ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (D). Finally, intramolecular nucleophilic attack of compound D took place to afford GVL along with the regeneration of CZA-3 and the formation of ethanol. A trace amount of 1,4-PDO was also obtained by further hydrogenation of GVL [41]."
13,Conclusions,"We developed an effective ternary Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst by co-precipitation method for CTH process of EL to GVL. Comparing the various characterization results of CZA-3, CZ and CA, it seemed that ZnO and Al2O3 as binary supports could effectively regulate the specific surface area and the crystallite size of Cu in the catalysts. CZA-3 catalyst with the good dispersion of small Cu metal nanoparticles and relatively large BET surface area not only had the highest catalytic activity for the CTH process, but also had good circulation stability that could be reused at least four times without the loss of catalytic activity. In addition, the catalytic activities of CZA catalysts in CTH process of EL were closely related to the precursor calcination temperature which determined the crystallite size of Cu and its porous structure. Experimental results exhibited that lower precursor calcination temperature was needed for the reaction. With optimized conditions in hand, CZA-3 gave a 99.0% yield of GVL with i-PrOH as H-donor at 140 °C for 2 h. The present study provided a low cost, efficient and environmentally nanoparticle catalyst for the dehydrogenation process of i-PrOH and hydrogenation process of EL."
