0,Introduction,"Air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM), has been considered as one of the most serious health threats to the public health, atmosphere visibility, production efficiency, global climate and ecosystems (Apte, Marshall, Cohen, & Brauer, 2015; Huang et al., 2014; Zhang, He, & Huo, 2012). Depending on the particulate size, PM can be classified into PM10 (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm) and PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm). Herein, PM2.5 has a long lifetime for spreading over thousands of kilometers. It can adsorb toxic pollutants and bacteria in the air due to larger surface areas, and penetrate into the respiratory system and even the blood (Shen et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2011). Therefore, the development of versatile air filters to prevent PM2.5 from invading environment and human body is of great importance (Barhate & Ramakrishna, 2007). Nowadays, the nanofibers based filter has been verified to be an effective strategy for the removal of sub-micron aerosol (Leung & Hung, 2012). Consequently, many technologies, especially electrospinning have been developed to fabricate nanofibers in recent years (Zhu et al., 2017). This is because the electrospun nanofibers based filter can be prepared by various materials and exhibit controllable morphology and distinctive 3D structures (Jing et al., 2016; Wang & Pan, 2015; Zhang, Tang, et al., 2016). In particular, to further improve the filtration performance or tackle the trade-off between the filtration efficiency and pressure drop, the electrospun nanofibers incorporated with carbon nanotubes (CNT), metal-organic framework (MOF) or polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles (PTFE NPs) have been fabricated and show enhanced filtration performance due to the “slip effect” and electrostatic adsorption (Li, Wang, Zhang, & Wei, 2014; Wang, Zhao, Yin, Yu, & Ding, 2016; Zhang, Yuan, et al., 2016). However, unclear biological toxicity of nanoparticles and the dissipation of charges are unavoidable issues (Xiong, Yang, Zhu, Chen, & Dong, 2017). More importantly, the electrospun nanofibers usually suffer from low production rate and instability owning to their weak mechanical property (Singh, Ravi, Sun, & Tan, 2017). Consequently, other innovative approaches have been proposed to prepare the filter media. For instance, Liu et al. (2015) prepared poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) /TiO2 (PVA-co-PE/TiO2) hybrid nanofibrous filters via melt phase separation and suspension coating technique. The prepared nanofibers with diameters in a range of 50 nm–300 nm displayed a filtration efficiency of 95.3% owning to the decrease of pore size and the electrostatic absorption of TiO2 nanoparticles. Further, a different approach was described by using organic molecules self-assembly to design nanofibers. The self-assembled nanofibers based air filter reached a filtration efficiency of 89.69% for PM2.5 and 93.08% for PM10 particles (Singh et al., 2017). Very recently, an asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride-polyethylene glycol (PVDF-PEG) hollow fibers were developed by a dry-jet wet spinning technique and firstly applied to air filtration, which exhibited excellent filtration efficiency of 99.999% against poly-dispersed NaCl particles in both dead-end filtration and cross-flow filtration (Wang, Yong, Yu, & Chung, 2017). However, the pressure drop of the hollow fibers was too high and up to 5000 Pa. In addition to the preparation methods mentioned above, recent studies have found that nanofibers made from higher polar polymer materials can be used as high-efficient filters (Xu et al., 2018). For instance, Zhang, Zhang et al. (2017) reported that the direct e-spinning chitosan (CS) nanofibers exhibited more timesaving than other polymers in removing PM2.5, which was attributed to the strong polarity, positively charged NH3+ group and smaller diameter. Besides, CS is the second most abundant natural cationic polysaccharide with good membrane forming, biocompatibility and antibacterial ability. However, the mechanical brittleness of CS materials limits the practical applications. It is well-known that polymer blend with flexible-chain polymers is the most common method to improve the brittleness (Sionkowska, 2011). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a common synthetic polymer possesses good mechanical property and membrane forming, which is able to interact with CS through aggregation, ether-bridge connection and intermolecular hydrogen bond. Moreover, both CS and PVA have biodegradable ability so as to avoid the secondary environment pollution. Up to now, CS/PVA blend membranes have been extensively applied to reverse osmosis desalination, heavy metal adsorption, and wound dressing (Morgado, Miguel, Correia, & Aguiar, 2017; Salehi & Madaeni, 2014; Shafiq et al., 2017). The aim of this study is to explore a new avenue to tailor an antibacterial and environmentally friendly CS/PVA blend membrane for air filtration. A series of CS/PVA blend membranes with various mass ratios and thicknesses were prepared via NIPS. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were adopted in order to explore the miscibility between CS and PVA. Subsequently, the morphology, structure, mechanical property and surface charge were characterized. The filtration performance for NaCl aerosol particles removal was explored. Additionally, the antibacterial ability against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was also evaluated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CS powder (Mw = 540 kDa, degree of deacetylation = 87.3%) was purchased from National Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (China) and PVA pellet (Mw = 77 kDa, degree of hydrolysis = 88%) was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co., Ltd. (China). Adipic acid and other reagents were obtained from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nonwoven fabrics with negligible filtration efficiency (3.0%) and pressure drop (3.3 Pa) as supporting in the filtration test was kindly provided by Seattle New Material Technology Co., Ltd. (China). E. coli (ATCC8739) and S. aureus (ATCC 6538) were obtained from Tianjin Medical University (China). Phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (7.16 g L−1 Na2HPO4·12H2O, 1.36 g L−1 KH2PO4) was prepared in house. Beef extract, peptone, and agar powder were supplied by Tianjin Sanjiang Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. (China)."
3,Membrane preparation,"2.2 Membrane preparation The CS/PVA membranes with various mass ratios were prepared via NIPS as demonstrated in Fig. 1 (a). Firstly, CS solution was prepared by dissolving CS powder in 0.2 mol L−1 adipic acid aqueous solution at 30 °C under magnetic stirring for 6 h. And similarly, PVA solution was prepared after dissolving PVA pellet in 0.2 mol L−1 adipic acid aqueous solution at 90 °C under mechanical stirring for 3 h and cooled to room temperature. Then, the casting solution was prepared by mixing the two solutions in various mass ratio and stirred until to a homogeneous solution. After degassed, the casting solution was cast on a clean glass plate using an automated membrane applicator (Elcometer 4340, England) with a desired thickness, and then immediately immersed into the coagulation bath of saturated Na2SO4 aqueous solution at 20 °C for 30 min. Finally, the prepared membrane was neutralized with 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH aqueous solution and rinsed with deionized water to remove the residual alkali and Na2SO4. Before characterization, the CS/PVA blend membranes were fully lyophilized. The composition and viscosity of different casting solutions were listed in Table 1 . The polymer concentration in all casting solutions was 7 wt.%. The corresponding membranes with different CS concentrations (10–50 wt.%) were named as M10, M20, M30, M40, and M50, respectively."
4,Membrane characterization,"2.3 Membrane characterization The chemical structure of CS/PVA blend membrane surface was characterized using ATR-FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicollet NEXUS-670, USA) at 4000–600 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The thermal behavior of CS/PVA blend membrane was evaluated by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (DSC 204F1, Germany) operated from 50 °C to 250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere protection. The crystallinity of PVA component (χ) was calculated as Eq. (1) (Bonilla, Fortunati, Atarés, Chiralt, & Kenny, 2014). (1) χ (%) = ΔH/(ΔH 0 × w) × 100% where ΔH is the enthalpy of melting, ΔH 0 is the enthalpy of melting for 100 wt.% crystalline PVA, which is 156 J g−1, and w is PVA concentration in the membrane samples. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of CS/PVA blend membrane was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TM3030, Japan). The membrane was attached on an aluminum stage, and the cross section of blend membrane was fractured after frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were dried in a freeze dryer (FD-1A-50, Boyikang, China), and sputter-coated with gold before observation. The pore size distribution and the average pore size of CS/PVA blend membrane were obtained by a capillary flow porometer (3H-2000PB, Beishide, China). The samples were thoroughly infiltrated with the wetting liquid (Porewick) prior to measurement. Moreover, Image J analysis software was used to examine the surface porosity by analyzing the surface SEM images. Five SEM images of each sample were selected randomly to calculate the surface porosity. The membrane porosity was determined according to dry-wet weight method (Li, Cui, Zhang, He, & Li, 2016). The mechanical property of CS/PVA blend membrane was evaluated using an electronic stretching machine (INSTRON-5969, USA) with a crosshead speed of 20 mm min−1 and an applied force of 0.25 cN. To minimize the experimental error, each sample with a valid size of 5 mm × 25 mm was tested five times to obtain the tensile stress and elongation at break. The zeta potential of CS/PVA blend membrane surface was analyzed by an electrokinetic analyzer (Anton Paar, Austria). The samples were tested in 1 mmol L−1 KCl aqueous solution at 25 °C under an operating pressure of 300 mbar."
5,Filtration performance,"2.4 Filtration performance The filtration performance of CS/PVA blend membrane was measured by an automatic filter tester (Model 8130, TSI Group, USA) (Gao et al., 2017). The charge neutralized mono-dispersed NaCl aerosols with mass median diameter of 260 nm and count median diameter of 75 nm were generated by an aerosol particle generator. Under the help of an air compressor and a flowmeter, the generated aerosols passed through the membrane with an effective area of 100 cm2 at a constant face velocity. The filtration efficiency (η) of the membrane was calculated by Eq. (2). Furthermore, the quality factor (QF) as a trade-off parameter between the filtration efficiency and the pressure drop was calculated by Eq. (3). (2) η (%) = 1 − C e/Ci (3) QF (KPa−1) = −ln(1 − η)/ΔP where C e and C i represented the aerosol particle number concentrations at the inlet and the outlet of the filter holder, which were detected by laser photometer. ΔP was the pressure drop, which was measured by a pressure transmitter. The filtration experiment was conducted at room temperature with a face velocity of 5.3 cm s−1. The filtration efficiency, pressure drop, and QF of the membranes were calculated after excluding the contribution of PET nonwoven fabrics. The numerical results were reported as the mean value and standard deviation of five times measurements."
6,Antibacterial experiment,"2.5 Antibacterial experiment The antibacterial ability of CS/PVA blend membrane was evaluated via colony counting method using E. coli and S. aureus as the model bacteria (Meng et al., 2015). In brief, the bacteria were inoculated in 250 mL Lysogeny Broth (LB) liquid medium (15 g L−1 peptone, 5 g L−1 beef extract and 5 g L−1 sodium chloride, pH = 7.5) and cultivated in an incubator shaker at 37 °C and 120 rpm for 24 h. Subsequently, 1 mL of the bacterial suspension was pipetted into a flask containing 100 mL of LB liquid medium and incubated for 18 h to enhance the activity of the bacteria. The active suspension was then 100-fold diluted with LB liquid medium followed by 100-fold diluted with PBS. After that, the CS/PVA blend membrane (0.75 g, 5 mm × 5 mm) sterilized by ultraviolet radiation were immersed into a flask with 5 mL diluted bacteria suspension and 70 mL PBS, and the mixture was incubated in an incubator shaker at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 18 h. After the incubation process, serially 10-fold diluted bacteria suspension (100 μL) was spread on the prepared agar plates in the Petri dishes and cultured in a biochemical incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. Finally, the number of viable bacteria colonies was counted from the agar plate, and the antibacterial rate (Y) was calculated according to Eq. (4). (4) Y (%) = (C b − C s)/C b × 100% where C b and C s are the bacterial concentration of the diluted bacteria suspension after the incubation process with the black sample and the CS/PVA membranes, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Miscibility of CS and PVA,"3.1 Miscibility of CS and PVA The proposed interactions among CS, PVA and adipic acid in the casting solution were illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The adipic acid with two carboxyl groups provided protons for CS dissolution as well as interacted with the positively charged amino groups or acetyl group via the ionic interaction (the red dotted circle). Herein, the adipic acid acted as an ionic cross-linking reagent (Hamdine, Heuzey, & Bégin, 2005). Besides, these positively charged groups together with hydroxyl groups on CS would interact with PVA through ample hydrogen bonds (the blue dotted line) after blending. FTIR analysis of PVA pellet, CS powder, and CS/PVA blend membrane was carried out to confirm the proposed interaction mechanism and the miscibility of CS and PVA as shown in Fig. 2 (a). The broad absorption band at 3262 cm−1 in the spectrum of PVA pellet corresponded to the stretching υ (OH) mode of the free hydroxyl groups, which involved in the intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds. A similar broad contour was observed in the spectra of chitosan powder (3429 cm−1) and CS/PVA blend membrane (3000–3400 cm−1), which was ascribed to the stretching υ (NH) and υ (OH) vibrations. It meant that hydrogen bonds between −OH groups or between −OH and −NH2 groups occurred in CS/PVA blend polymer. Moreover, the peak position of bands corresponding to the amide group of CS/PVA blend membrane (1630 cm−1 and 1530 cm−1) was clearly lower than that of CS powder (1650 cm−1 and 1597 cm−1). This proved that the bonds of the amide group were weaker, because the strong intermolecular interactions between CS and PVA occurred after blending. This proves that the CS and PVA are miscible (Dai & Fan, 2011; Socrates, 2001; Zając, Hanuza, Wandas, & Dymińska, 2015). To further confirm the above observations, DSC analysis of PVA pellet, CS powder, and CS/PVA blend membrane were carried out as shown in Fig. 2(b). It was found that the melting endothermic peak decreased from 232.0 °C to 209.9 °C with the increase of CS concentration from 0 to 50 wt.%. The corresponding melting enthalpies (ΔH) were 68.6, 40.1, 27.4, 19.7, 15.5, and 11.6 J g−1 respectively. Hereon, the crystallinity of PVA component (χ) calculated by Eq. (1) decreased from 44.0% to 14.9%. The reason was that the incorporation of CS in PVA solution increased the steric hindrance and changed the ordered structure of PVA chains, leading to rearrangement in crystalline zone as a result of the interaction of intermolecular hydrogen bond between CS and PVA (Çay, Miraftab, & Perrin, 2014; Hang, Tae, & Park, 2010). In sum, the above observations are in good agreement with FTIR analysis and the proposed interaction mechanism."
9,Membrane morphologies,"3.2 Membrane morphologies The SEM photographs of CS/PVA blend membrane were presented in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3(a), M10 exhibited a typical asymmetric structure with an obvious skin layer and honeycomb porous structure. Interestingly, the skin layer disappeared at M20 and the honeycomb structure gradually changed into the sponge-like structure with the increase of CS concentration from 20 wt.% (M20) to 50 wt.% (M50). Specifically, the average pore size and surface porosity of CS/PVA blend membrane increased from 59.6 nm and 3.0% to 495 nm and 21.5% (Table 2 ) with the increase of CS concentration from 10 wt.% (M10) to 30 wt.% (M30) and then decreased to 355 nm and 7.0% with the further increasing of CS concentration to 50 wt.% (M50). M30 with 30 wt.% CS concentration had the largest average pore size and surface porosity. Generally, the pure PVA membrane obtained by NIPS displays a dense skin layer (Chuang, Young, Yao, & Chiu, 1999). However, the introduction of CS in PVA solution would disrupt the intra- and inter- molecular interactions among PVA chains and so far as to form new intermolecular interactions between CS and PVA (Zhang, Zou, et al., 2017). The new interactions would retrain the aggregation of PVA rich phase during the phase separation, leading to the obtained blend membrane with large pore size and high surface porosity. Noteworthily, the viscosity of casting solution rapidly increased from 588 mPa s to 1650 mPa s with an increase of CS concentration from 10 wt.% to 50 wt.% in the casting solution (Table 1). This is ascribed to the fact that the molecular weight of CS (Mw = 540 kDa) is much larger than that of PVA (Mw = 77 kDa) and both of them are miscible. Consequently, the casting solution with a high viscosity and more than 30 wt.% CS concentration would markedly restrict the movement of polymer chains and slow down the mutual diffusion between solvent and non-solvent during phase inversion, finally leading to the obtained blend membrane with a small pore size and low surface porosity (M40-M50) (Holda, Aernouts, Saeys, & Vankelecom, 2013; Hung, Wang, Lai, & Chou, 2016). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 4 , the pore size distribution curves of CS/PVA blend membranes shifted to the positive direction with a large pore size as the increase of CS concentration from 10 wt.% (M10) to 30 wt.% (M30) and then back in the opposite direction with a small pore size. In addition, it could be also found from Table 2 that the membrane porosity of CS/PVA blend membrane increased from 64.9% to 74.4% with the increase of CS concentration from 10 wt.% (M10) to 50 wt.% (M50). This indicated that the introduction of CS in PVA solution brought about the evolution of membrane structure from a relatively compact structure to a loose structure (Chuang et al., 1999). In sum, the final morphologies of CS/PVA blend membranes were strongly affected by the concentration of CS in casting solution."
10,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of filtration media are one of the major concerns in practical applications. The tensile stress and elongation at break of CS/PVA blend membrane were illustrated in Table 2 and Fig. S1. As a comparison, the tensile strength of M10 was up to 6.06 MPa due to the intermolecular interactions between PVA and CS, and the ionic cross-linking between polymers and adipic acid (Chen et al., 2008). Interestingly, the largest tensile strength of 6.36 MPa was obtained from M20. The reason was that M20 contained more CS molecules, which had a large molecular weight and hard backbones compared with M10 (Zhuang, Li, Fan, Lin, & Hu, 2012). However, up further increasing the CS concentration from 30 wt.% (M30) to 50 wt.% (M50), the tensile strength gradually decreased from 2.82 MPa to 1.00 MPa. This was because of the membrane structure evolution from a relatively compact structure to a loose structure. On the other hand, it also can be found from Table 2 that the elongation at break decreased from 31.0% to 4.20% with the increase of CS concentration from 10 wt.% (M10) to 50 wt.% (M50) (Bonilla et al., 2014)."
11,Filtration performances,"3.4 Filtration performances An excellent filter usually exhibits the hierarchical or gradient structure for trapping particles with different diameters during air filtration (Zhu et al., 2017). The filtration performance of CS/PVA blend membrane with a gradient interconnected structure was conducted at a face velocity of 5.3 cm s−1 as shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen in Fig. 5 that M10 displayed a high filtration efficiency of 99.82% for NaCl aerosols removal due to the small pore size of 59.6 nm and low surface porosity of 3.00%. However, a large pressure drop of 1500 Pa had reached the threshold value of the filter tester. A similar phenomenon can be observed in M20. Interestingly, the filtration efficiency and pressure drop distinctly decreased from 98.41% and 928.5 Pa to 18.47% and 178.6 Pa with the increase of CS concentration from 30 wt.% (M30) to 40 wt.% (M40). This was because the mechanical property of M40 (1.20 MPa) was so weak that it was hard to carry out the filtration test. Similarly, M50 showed a lower filtration efficiency of 10.85% and pressured drop of 154.6 Pa. Finally, M30 was selected as a preferable candidate in the following control of membrane structure. Obviously, the filtration performance is relative to the thickness of filtration media. In order to investigate the relationship between filtration performance and membrane thickness, CS/PVA blend membranes with thickness of 101, 68, 37, and 16 μm were prepared from the casting solution of M30 and designated as M30-1, M30-2, M30-3, and M30-4, respectively. Herein, CS/PVA blend membranes (M30-1, M30-2, M30-3, and M30-4) with different thickness exhibited the similar morphology including pore size distribution, surface porosity and average pore size as shown in Fig. S2-3 and Table S1. In other word, M30-1, M30-2, M30-3, and M30-4 have the similar surface direct interception for the removal of aerosol particles. The filtration performance of CS/PVA blend membranes with different thickness was demonstrated in Fig. 6 (a). When the blend membrane decreased in the thickness from 101 μm (M30-1) to 37 μm (M30-3), the filtration efficiency slowly decreased from 98.41% to 95.59%. Meanwhile, the corresponding pressure drop declined from 928.5 Pa to 633.5 Pa. The decrease of filtration efficiency and pressure drop was related to the thinning membrane with short filtration path (or pore channel) for air flow (Leung, Hung, & Yuen, 2010). This resulted in the weakening of inertia impact and diffusion effect for capturing aerosol particles. However, when the membrane thickness further decreased to 16 μm, M30-4 cannot remain intact during filtration test, which led to a failure of surface direct interception and then a sharp decrease to 70.4% in filtration efficiency. The corresponding pressure drop obtained was 355.5 Pa. There are several mechanisms, including direct interception, inertia impact, Brownian diffusion, and electrostatic adsorption, to remove aerosol particles from the air stream (Li et al., 2014). In this study, most of NaCl aerosol particles were captured on the intact membrane surface by direct interception. Meanwhile, a few of NaCl aerosol particles were captured in the membrane pore channel through inertia impact and diffusion effect. In order to further evaluate the filtration performance of CS/PVA blend membrane, QF (Eq. (3)) was introduced as shown in Fig. 6(b). QF values of M30-1, M30-2, M30-3, and M30-4 were 4.23, 4.68, 4.93, and 4.58 kPa−1, respectively. Obviously, M30-3 exhibited the highest QF value. This implied that the thickness of the membrane is closely related to the filtration performance."
12,Antibacterial properties,"3.5 Antibacterial properties The antibacterial property of M30 was tested following the colony counting method. Digital photographs of bacteria colony on the agar plate related to the blank, PVA membrane, CS membrane and M30 were shown in Fig. 7 . The bacterial suspension concentration and antibacterial rate by counting the bacteria colony were summarized in Fig. 8 . It is obvious that the number of E. coli and S. aureus colonies related to the blank and PVA membrane was more than that related to M30. The suspension concentrations of E. coli and S. aureus were 13.5 × 106 CFU mL−1 and 2.53 × 103 CFU mL−1, respectively. Interestingly, no colony was detected on the agar plate for bacteria cultured with CS membrane, which indicated that the antibacterial rate was up to 100% for both E. coli and S. aureus. The antibacterial rate obtained from PVA membrane was only 2.2% for E. coli and 1.6% for S. aureus, which implied that there was almost no any antibacterial activity. Consequently, it confirmed that the antibacterial activity of M30 with 94.8% for E. coli and 91.3% for S. aureus came from CS component. Further, Verlee, Mincke, and Stevens (2017) described that the antibacterial ability of CS based material was related to the surface charge. In this study, the surface charge of CS/PVA blend membrane was decided by CS concentration as shown in Fig. S3. M30 with 30 wt.% CS concentration exhibited positive charge of 18.9 mV as a result of the high molecular weight chitosan (Mw = 540 kDa) and degree of deacetylation (87.3%). The electrostatic interaction between M30 and bacteria disrupted the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in the leakage of intracellular constituents and the death of bacteria (Raafat, von Bargen, Haas, & Sahl, 2008). Besides, M30 could chelate the trace metal and then inhibit bacteria reproduction (Wang, Yang, & Zhang, 2010). In addition, it also can be found that the antibacterial rate of M30 for E. coli was higher than that for S. aureus. The reason was that E. coli cell wall was thinner and consequently more susceptible than S. aureus (Goy, Morais, & Assis, 2016)."
13,Conclusions,"CS/PVA blend membrane was successfully prepared via NIPS. The CS/PVA blend system was miscible owning to the interaction of the intermolecular hydrogen bond between them. The structure and properties of the resultant membrane were closely related to the CS concentration in the casting solution. The morphology of the resultant membrane evolved from honeycomb structure to sponge-like structure with the increase of CS concentration. M30 with 30 wt.% CS concentration exhibited a largest pore size of 467 nm and surface porosity of 21.5%, a moderate tensile strength of 2.82 MPa, and a positive charge of 18.9 mV. The thickness of the membrane is closely related to the filtration performance and the direct interception on membrane surface was the dominant mechanism for removing NaCl aerosol particles. M30-3 with the thickness of 37 μm exhibited the highest quality factor for air filtration and the filtration efficiency of 95.59% and pressure drop of 633.5 Pa were achieved. Additionally, the resultant membrane displayed high antibacterial ability against E. coli and S. aureus. In brief, our research opens a new avenue to tailor an antibacterial and environmentally friendly blend membrane for air filtration."
