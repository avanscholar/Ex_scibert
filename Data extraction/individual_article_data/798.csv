0,Introduction,"The development of renewable and sustainable energy sources have become an increasing concern because of increasing global warming and diminishing fossil fuel resources. Hydrogen's energetic potential lies in its ability to serve as a renewable energy source for efficient energy storage, transport, and manipulation with little or no pollution [1]. Hydrogen production through splitting water over a semiconductor-based photocatalyst in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell has been gaining a great deal of scientific attention owing to the solar energy utilization, simple setup, environmental compatibility, and so on. [2–4]. However, developing a proper semiconductor with narrow bandgap energy and sufficient negative conduction band (CB) potential is a major obstacle to enhancing the efficiency of solar hydrogen production in a PEC cell. Many researchers have mainly focused on hydrogen production over powder photocatalysts in batch reactor systems, which possess certain disadvantages, including the difficulty of separating gaseous products (H2 and O2) and inactive catalysts, a fast backward reaction between H2 and O2, and a tendency for agglomeration [5–7]. The immobilization of a thin film in the PEC cell can reduce the effect of the encountered drawbacks with powder suspension. However, the presence of overvoltage losses in the PEC cell hampers its performance for practical solar hydrogen production [8,9]. Connecting the DSSC to the PEC cell has been considered to be an attractive configuration to provide sufficient bias for a practical driving water redox over WO3 and α-Fe2O3 photocatalysts in the PEC cell. However, these photocatalysts with a positive CB do not meet the requirement for hydrogen production [10–12]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), as a significant metal oxide semiconductor, has been extensively studied for photocatalytic hydrogen production with some promising properties like non-toxic nature, low cost, high resistance to chemical and photochemical corrosion, and negative CB [13,14]. TiO2-based photocatalysts have not been adopted for large-scale solar hydrogen production applications because of their short wavelength excitation, fast recombination rates of photogenerated charge carriers, and low quantum efficiency. Introducing metal oxides into the TiO2 substrate is an effective approach for decreasing the bandgap energy, and therefore, improving the sunlight utilization [15–18]. In addition, TiO2 codoping such as Au-Cu [19], Fe-Cr [20], Cu-Ni [21,22], and Fe-Ni [23] can suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs and enhance hydrogen production performance. There has been no systematic investigation performed on the PEC components in the presence of modified TiO2 to enhance the performance of solar hydrogen production in the PEC-DSSC system. In our previous works, we investigated the influence of the preparation parameters including water, acid, Cu to Ni molar ratios, calcination temperature, and duration and total metal loading on the physiochemical and PEC properties of modified TiO2 through codoped Cu and Ni oxides in a PEC-DSSC system [21,24–26]. Moreover, we also explored the effect of the sintering temperature and thickness of the photoanode, electrolyte concentrations, and applied voltages on solar-driven hydrogen production and PEC properties in the PEC-DSSC system [8]. For gaining structural and mechanistic insights into further development of photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2 in the PEC-DSSC system, we synthesized a series of modified TiO2 as a photoanode in the PEC cell by varying the types of dopants (Cu and Ni oxides) using the sol-gel–associated hydrothermal method. The particular properties, such as crystal sizes and phases, surface morphology, surface chemical state, and absorbance of the prepared photocatalysts, were investigated by different characterization techniques. In addition, the influence of the active area of the photoanode, nature and concentration of sacrificial agents, and light intensities were investigated on the PEC properties and solar hydrogen production. To the best of the author knowledge, this systematic study on the reaction parameters in the PEC-DSSC system for hydrogen production has not been reported and it helps us to optimize reaction parameters toward practical approach for solar hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation A series of single and codoped Cu- and Ni-doped TiO2 were synthesized using the sol-gel–associated hydrothermal method. All the chemicals were purchased from Merck and used without further purification. The codoped TiO2 was prepared by mixing Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, titanium (IV) isopropoxide, absolute ethanol, and glacial acetic acid with a mixture of water and ethanol under vigorous stirring. Afterward, the hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 180°C for 12 h. The raw photocatalyst was separated via centrifuging (4000 rmp, 15 min) and rinsed with a mixture of deionized water and ethanol, dried at 105 C overnight, calcined at 450°C for 2 h, and labeled CN–TiO2 [25]. It is notable that the total metal loading and the ratio of Cu to Ni in codoped TiO2 were 10 mol.% and 6:4, respectively [25]. In addition, single Cu-doped TiO2 (C–TiO2), Ni-doped TiO2 (N–TiO2), and pure TiO2 were synthesized using a similar procedure, and their photocatalytic activities were compared with CN–TiO2."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen production setup,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production setup The modified TiO2 photoanode for the PEC cell was fabricated by printing four layers of modified TiO2 paste on the surface of a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate. Details of the paste preparation have been explained in our previous published work [27]. Fig. 1 shows a DSSC connected to a PEC cell in series to supply the required external potential (0.7 V). The DSSC was fabricated by sealing a sandwich layer of the double-layered–sensitized TiO2 with N719 dye and the printed platinum paste (Dyesol) using a hot-melt thermoplastic gasket. Afterward, it was filled with iodide-triiodide redox couple as the electrolyte. Finally, the photocatalytic reactions were conducted using a 500 W halogen lamp with visible light irradiation to investigate the PEC properties and photocatalytic hydrogen production. The hydrogen was collected around the Pt rod in a reversed burette over 2 h and identified using a multiple gas analyzer with computer controlled software (SRI Instruments 8610–0071)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was applied to quantify the amount of Cu and Ni elements by using a PerkinElmer-optima 8300 spectrometer. The crystal structure and phases were identified by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance instrument). The specific surface area (SBET) and optical properties of the photocatalysts were determined using a micromeritic ASAP 2000 analyzer and diffuse reflectance UV-Visible (DR-UV-Vis) spectroscopy (carry 100), respectively. In addition, further information related to the morphological and crystallographic information of the photocatalysts was obtained by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Zeiss Libra 200). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to study the surface chemical properties of the photocatalysts using Thermo-scientific K-Alpha with the standard calibration for copper, silver, and gold. The charge carrier transfer resistance, photocurrent densities, and flat band potential were investigated by applying electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photocurrent density (I-V), and Mott-Schottky (M-S) analysis, respectively. A computer controlled potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302 N, Metrohm) coupling with a frequency response analyzer module was used to conduct EIS with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 KHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV in the dark using Z-Plot/Z-View to control the instrument operation and data acquisition. The photocurrent density was measured by means of the linear sweep voltammetry procedure for data acquisition at a potential ranging from −0.5 to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 [26]. In addition, Mott-Schottky (M-S) was carried out on the EIS procedure to measure the capacitance as a function of the released potential in the system under depletion conditions [28]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Physicochemical properties The ICP-OES data show that the quantities of Cu and Ni were close to the target values as presented in Table 1 . In addition, these data confirm that Cu and Ni were well dispersed on the TiO2 surface. Fig. 2 displays the XRD patterns of all the synthesized doped and undoped TiO2. The XRD pattern of TiO2 (JCPDS 89–4921) illustrates the presence of anatase (101) as the main TiO2 phase and other anatase phases with less intensity (004, 113, 200, 105, 211, 204, 116, 220, and 301). The anatase phase of TiO2 with a more negative CB is the most promising phase for photocatalytic hydrogen production compared with its rutile phase [21,26,29]. The XRD patterns of all doped TiO2 were similar to pure TiO2 with a slight shifting and broadening of the anatase peaks. These shifts demonstrate the presence of some distortion in the anatase crystalline structure due to the incorporation of Cu2+(0.73 Å) and Ni2+ (0.69 Å) into the lattice sites [30–32]. The diffraction peak of NiO (JCPDS 65–2901) species were detected at 43.28° and 43.30° with fairly low intensity, corresponding to the NiO (200) phase [33]. Moreover, the CuO (002) and (111) peaks appeared at 35.48° and 38.7° in C–TiO2 and CN–TiO2 respectively, [34,35]. The Scherrer crystallite size of TiO2, C–TiO2, N–TiO2, and CN–TiO2 were 14.31, 12.45, 11.86, and 11.23 nm, respectively. The crystallite sizes of doped TiO2 were smaller than pure TiO2 because of suppressed crystal growth, thereby correlating with previous studies [16,23]. The crystallite size of C–TiO2 was slightly bigger than N–TiO2 because Cu2+ (0.73 Å) occupies interstitial positions of Ti4+ (0.68 Å) and results in strain in the crystal structure, as reported by Nishikiori et al. [36]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all prepared photocatalysts confirmed the IV hysteresis loop for mesoporous material. The existence of mesoporous pores improves the photocatalytic performance owing to a rapid diffusion of various reactants on the surface of the photocatalyst [37]. Table 2 shows that the porosity of the modified TiO2 with metal oxide enhanced owing to incorporation of Cu and Ni ions in the crystal structure and the elimination of nitrates from precursors during the heat treatment [38]. Furthermore, the codoped TiO2 had a slightly larger surface area with a great importance to increase the active reaction sites and interaction at electrode-electrolyte interface [23]. The TEM images reveal that the anatase phases of TiO2 were crystalline with cubic and hexagonal shapes as shown in Fig. 3 (a–d). The measured primary average particle sizes of TiO2, C–TiO2, N–TiO2, and CN–TiO2 were 14.90, 13.53, 12.41, and 11.65 nm, respectively. The similarity of these values and crystallite sizes calculated from X-ray diffractometer (XDR) implies that each particle is a single crystal [16,39]. Fig. 3(e–h) demonstrates the HRTEM images of (101) plane TiO2 anatase phase with the lattice fringe interlayer distance of ~0.35 nm [40]. In addition, the lattice plane of TiO2 (200) with the d-spacing of 0.194 nm was also detected in the C–TiO2 (Fig. 3(f)) and N–TiO2 (Fig. 3(g)) photocatalysts [41]. Furthermore, the lattice plane with a d-spacing of 0.235 nm for NiO (111) was detected in the N–TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 3(g)). The d-spacing of 0.240 nm for Cu2O (111) was observed in C–TiO2 (Fig. 3(f)) and CN–TiO2 (Fig. 3(h)). The coexistence of Cu2O and CuO on the surface of TiO2 helps to accelerate the interfacial electron transfer and reduce the charge carrier recombination by trapping photoexcited electrons in the CB of Cu2+ and transferring electrons from Cu+ to the adsorbed oxygen (Oad)[16,42]. The selected area electron diffraction pattern with polycrystalline rings in all the prepared photocatalysts for different anatase phases of TiO2 are depicted in Fig. 3(i–l). These rings correspond to (101), (004), and (200) planes of anatase TiO2 from the inner to the outer rings, respectively [43]. Fig. 4 (a) displays that the absorption spectra of doped TiO2 significantly shift to the visible region (400–800 nm) compared with the absorption of pure TiO2. The Tauc plots in Fig. 4(b) were adapted to find the bandgap energy at the intersection of a line drawn on the linear part of the plots with the horizontal axis, where [F (R). hʋ]1/2 is equal to zero [17]. The photon energy was obtained using Planck-Einstein (E = hc/λ), where, h is Planck constant = 4.13566733 × 10−15 eVs, c is the speed of light = 2.99792458 × 108 ms−2, and λ (nm) is the wavelength. The measured bandgap energies of TiO2, C–TiO2, N–TiO2, and CN–TiO2 were 3.00, 2.73, 2.90, and 2.54 eV, respectively. The absorbance of the modified TiO2 considerably extend to the visible region because of the presence of the subband states of Cu and Ni oxides in the middle of the bandgap energy of TiO2, causing the indirect transitions of the photoexcited electrons from the valence band (VB) to the CB edges. Furthermore, CuO species are able to trap both the photoexcited electron and the hole, however, NiO only traps holes. Thus, the presence of copper and nickel oxides can reduce the recombination rates and increase the number of photoexcited electrons on the surface of the photocatalyst [41,46]. The absorption peak of TiO2 in the UV region is related to the electron transfer from VB (2p orbitals of O2–) to CB (3 d orbitals of Ti4+). The surface plasmon resonance of Ni nanoparticles might be responsible for the significant and continuous absorption band of N–TiO2 from 400 to 700 nm [47]. The absorption bands of C–TiO2 at 210–270 and 400–600 nm correspond to the charge transition from ligand to metal [O2- (2p) → Cu2+ (3 d)] and the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+, respectively. Furthermore, the d-d (2E2g →2T2g) transition of a single electron in Cu2+ species causes an extension of the absorption edge into near infrared [48–51]. The synergistic effect of Cu and Ni could decrease the bandgap energy and extend the optical absorption into the visible region for the CN–TiO2 compared with others, which is in good agreement with the earlier reports by Riza et al. [17], and Sun et al. [36]. Fig. 5 (a) displays the XPS peaks of the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 spin-orbital splitting in undoped TiO2 at 458.58 and 464.88 eV, respectively. These peaks illustrate the presence of typical Ti4+ with octahedral coordination on the TiO2 surface [44,45]. The Ti2p3/2 binding energies in the modified TiO2 slightly shifted to the high binding energies, corresponding to the incorporation of both Ni2+ and Cu2+ in the TiO2 lattice site. In addition, the Ti2p1/2 peaks at 461.28 ± 0.1 eV for the Ti3+ species with more photocatalytic activity compared with Ti4+ species were identified in the doped TiO2 photocatalysts. Fig. 5(b) represents the XPS spectra of the O1s region for different types of oxygen species. The lattice oxygen (OL) peaks were the most intense peaks at 529 ± 0.5 and 530 eV for TiO2 and Ti2O3, respectively. The binding energy around 531 is related to the Oad owing to weak bonding oxygen or hydroxyl species on the photocatalyst surface [31]. The binding energy between 534 and 536 eV is ascribed to the adsorbed H2O of hydration, which usually appears ~1.5–3.5 eV higher than the OL [46]. The absorbed oxygen explains the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2, which can maintain the charge balance on the surface of TiO2 and improve the photocatalytic performance [31]. The peak of adsorbed H2O was more intense on the surface of CN–TiO2 because of more oxygen vacancies. Fig. 5(c) displays the XPS peaks of Cu2+ about 933 and 953 eV for Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively in C–TiO2 and CN–TiO2 photocatalysts. In addition, the binding energies at 932.5 and 952.38 eV for Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 illustrate the spin-orbital photoelectrons of Cu+ in Cu2O [38,47]. The shakeup satellite peaks at 940 eV in C–TiO2 correspond to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer in Cu2+ [48]. Fig. 5(d) demonstrates the XPS peaks of NiO species in C–TiO2 and CN–TiO2. The low intensity of the Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 peaks in CN–TiO2 is attributed to the incorporation of Ni in the TiO2 lattice and its homogenous distribution on the surface of photocatalyst [49]. The deconvoluted peaks at 855.78 and 856.45 eV correspond to Ni2p3/2 of trivalent Ni3+. In addition, other deconvoluted peaks, at 857.48, 859.38, and 862.68 eV of Ni2p3/2, correspond to the shake-up satellites of Ni2+in NiO and Ni(OH)2. Furthermore, the deconvoluted XPS peaks at 871.88 and 874.48 eV attribute to Ni2p1/2 of Ni2+ [49,50]."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production In the following subsections, the influence of different parameters on photocatalytic hydrogen production and PEC properties are discussed in detail. 3.2.1 Effect of different metal dopants Fig. 6 displays that the codoped TiO2 with Cu and Ni has a higher activity with a maximum accumulative hydrogen evolution of 150.30 μmol cm−2 under the visible light irradiation in a mixture of KOH and 10 vol% glycerol solution compared with 71.5 and 131.7 μmol cm−2 for N–TiO2 and C–TiO2, respectively. In addition, oxygen gas was not detected on the surface of the photoanode because of the fast oxidation of glycerol (sacrificial agent) by the photogenerated positive holes in competition with the hydroxyl groups from the water. This enhanced photocatalytic performance of CN–TiO2 corresponds to its small particles with large surface area and short distance for the migration of photogenerated electrons at the electrode and electrolyte surface. The synergetic influence of coexistence of Cu and Ni in TiO2 structure caused a high Cu2O:CuO ratio, oxygen vacancies, more absorbance in the visible region, and uniform particle size distribution. Moreover, the coexistence of copper and nickel oxides as p-type semiconductors with an n-type TiO2 photocatalyst creates p-n junctions on the surface of TiO2, facilitating charge carrier separation, reducing the recombination rate, and increasing the electron lifetime and the photocurrent density; the details have been presented in our previous research work [27]. The CN–TiO2 photocatalyst with the highest produced hydrogen was chosen for further optimization of the photoanode active area. 3.2.2 Effect of photoanode active area Finding the optimum photoanode active area is an essential ingredient to enhance PEC cell performance; however, it has not been widely investigated. Fig. 7 reveals the effect of different active areas (1, 1.5, and 2 cm2) on the hydrogen production of the CN–TiO2 photocatalyst. The accumulative hydrogen production reduced from 286.4 to 150.3 μmol cm−2 by increasing the photoanode active areas from 1 to 2 cm2. EIS was conducted to explain the influence of the active areas on the charge carrier transfer resistance and interaction between the modified TiO2 electrodes and the electrolyte interface on hydrogen production. Fig. 8 (a) shows the Nyquist plots under simulated 1 SUN illumination in a 1 M KOH and 10 vol% glycerol solution using a conventional three-electrode configuration. The equivalent circuit was fitted (inset, Fig. 8(a)) using the Randel's model, and the fitted data are tabulated in Table 3 . The sheet resistance (Rs) is in series with parallel connection of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and double layer capacitance (CPEsc) elements. Rct is in series with a Warburg diffusion impedance (W) of OH− or H+ ions on the surface of the electrodes at the low-frequency region [51,52]. The Nyquist plots and fitting data show that increasing the active surface area from 1 to 2 cm2 causes significant growth in the charge transfer resistance and charge carrier recombination rate. Consequently, the electron lifetime (τn = Rct × CPE) was reduced with a negative impact on the number of charge carrier species at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Fig. 8(b) depicts that the measured photocurrent density at 0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl decreased from 13.46 to 4.9 mA cm−2 by increasing the photoanode active area from 1 to 2 cm2. The photocurrent density decreased for a small change in the active area of TiO2 photoanodes because of less photogenerated electron transfer from the electrode surface to the outer circuit as confirmed by the EIS results [53,54]. The data of the photocurrent density and EIS disclose a linear relationship between the active area and the number of defect states as the charge carrier trapping centers. Therefore, a photoanode with a high active area has more charge transfer resistance and charge carrier recombination rate, which has a negative impact on the number of photoexcited electrons on the outer circuit [55]. 3.2.3 Effect of sacrificial agent nature and concentration Fig. 9 illustrates the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over CN–TiO2 thin film with an active area of 1 cm2 in 1 M KOH solution and different sacrificial agents (ethanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, and formic acid) with a concentration of 10 vol% in the PEC cell. The accumulative hydrogen production was 114.8 μmol cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution in the absence of organic sacrificial agents. Adding alcohol series increased the accumulative hydrogen production up to a maximum of 286.4 μmol cm−2 in the presence of glycerol. The amount of produced hydrogen confirms that the slow oxidation of hydroxyl groups by the photogenerated holes, resulting in more electron-hole recombination rates and suppressing of hydrogen production. The Mott-Schottky plot (1/C2 vs. V) provides information about flat band potential (V fb , 1/C2 = 0) and charge carrier density (ND) at the photoelectrode-electrolyte interface. Fig. 10 depicts the M-S plots with positive slopes as expected for an n-type semiconductor. The varying nature of the sacrificial agent from formic acid to glycerol caused a significant negative shift of the flat band potential and increased the ND as tabulated in Table 4 . This linear relationship between the flat band potential and pH electrolyte is explained by the Nernst equation ( V f b = V f b 0 − R T ln 10 F p H ) , where R is the universal gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, and T (K) is temperature [56]. A more negative V fb of the photocatalyst in the presence of glycerol has the thermodynamic ability to reduce more water to hydrogen. A higher value of ND in glycerol solution reveals a better photocurrent density compared with other sacrificial agents. This study confirmed that glycerol, as an industrial by-product, can be oxidized using a quite cheap method to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production [21]. Fig. 11 demonstrates the influence of different glycerol concentrations (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 vol%) as the designated sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production over a CN–TiO2 photoanode. The maximum accumulative hydrogen production was 338.4 μmol cm−2 in the mixture of KOH and 5 vol% glycerol. However, increasing the glycerol concentration from 5 to 20 vol% reduced the accumulative hydrogen production from 338.4 to 61.5 μmol cm−2. At a low concentration of glycerol (2 vol%), the EIS plots (Fig. 12 (a)) and the fitted equivalent circuit data (Table 5 ) reveal a high charge transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface owing to the slow rate of oxidizing hydroxyl groups of water, high recombination rate of charge carriers, and short electron lifetime. Consequently, the number of photoexcited electrons and photocurrent density diminished at the electrode-electrolyte interface (Fig. 12(b)). At high concentration of glycerol, the viscosity of glycerol is high which saturates active sites of thin film, increases charge transfer resistance, and decreases the electron lifetime and the photocurrent density [57]. Furthermore, the intermediates of glycerol oxidation compete with the glycerol to trap photogenerated hole, resulting in a negative impact on hydrogen production [58]. 3.2.4 Illumination intensity To date, there are only a few research work reports on the impact of light intensity on solar hydrogen production in PEC cells [59]. The effect of different light intensities was studied over the CN–TiO2 photocatalyst with an active area of 1 cm2 in the presence of 1 M KOH and 5 vol% of glycerol. Fig. 13 shows that the relationship between hydrogen production and light intensity until 100 mWcm−2 was linearly positive because the charge carrier consumption through the chemical reaction on the surface of photoanode is faster than the recombination rate of charge carriers. Increasing light intensity (340 mWcm−2) had an antagonistic effect on the amount of hydrogen produced from 338.4 to 73.9 μmol cm-2. Fig. 14 depicts the stability testing of CN–TiO2 composite at the optimum reaction condition. The results confirm that the photocatalyst produced hydrogen during 25 h without clear deactivation during repeated utilization. The fluctuations in photocatalytic hydrogen production by increasing light intensity explain that higher light intensity boosts the number of photoexcited electrons on the surface of the photoanode. Therefore, high charge carrier density increases the charge transfer resistance and recombination rate as shown in Fig. 15 (a) and Table 6 . In addition, Fig. 15(b) reveals that the photocurrent density reduced at high light intensity due to the high charge transfer resistance and low amount of photoexcited electrons at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Furthermore, the electrolyte viscosity decreases and ion mobility increases in the DSSC, which cause the intense charge recombination rates in the PEC cell and DSSC [60]. Furthermore, a similar result of decreasing voltage and efficiency of the DSSC under light intensity of more than 100 mWcm−2 was also reported by Adachi et al. [61]. Moreover, the photoconversion efficiency of all-prepared samples are shown in Figure S1 (supporting information). The maximum photoconversion efficiency of 6.26% at 0.03 V relates Vto CN–TiO at optimum reaction condition, which is the results of thick space charge layer at the photoelectrode-electrolyte interface and more electron transfer rates to external circuit compared with others. For comparison, the data were scaled to a light intensity of 100 mWcm−2, geometric area of 1 cm2, and applied voltage of 0.7 V. Lee et al. [62] reported hydrogen production of 56.6 μmol cm−2 over a WO3 photocatalyst in an H2SO4 solution. Shi et al. [12] described that the amount of produced hydrogen over WO3/BiVO4 photocatalyst reached 79.71 μmol cm−2 in a Na2SO4 solution. Maximum produced hydrogen of 338.4 μmol cm−2 over CN–TiO2 photocatalyst at the optimum condition confirms that CN–TiO2 is capable of facilitating the transfer of electrons and increasing the charge carrier separation. In addition, the CB edge of bulk WO3 was reported ~ +0.4 eV and below the hydrogen redox potential, which is still too positive for hydrogen production."
8,Conclusion,"We systematically investigated the effect of the photoanode properties and operating parameters on the photocatalytic hydrogen production and PEC properties in the PEC-DSSC system. The synergistic effect of coexisting Cu and Ni oxides in the TiO2 matrix improves solar hydrogen production compared with single doped and pure TiO2. These results are attributed to a greater absorbance in the visible region, the presence of Ti3+, a higher ratio of Cu2O:CuO, and oxygen vacancies on the surface of this photocatalyst. In addition, its improved physiochemical properties increased the number of photoexcited electrons at the photoelectrode-electrolyte interface, enhanced the charge carrier separations, and decreased the electron-hole recombination rates. The maximum accumulative hydrogen production over CN–TiO2 with an active area of 1 cm2 in 5 vol % of glycerol solution under the light intensity of 100 mWcm−2 was 338.4 μmol cm−2. Finally, these results confirm that a practical approach for hydrogen production requires further systematic studies by optimizing other operating parameters and applying one-dimensional heterostructure photoanodes to overcome overvoltage losses, provide sufficient voltage, and facilitate the electron transfer to the photoanode-electrolyte interface."
