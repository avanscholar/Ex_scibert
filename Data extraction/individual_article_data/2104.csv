0,Introduction,"Active packaging, whereby incorporated active components are released in a controlled manner, can serve as an effective way for increasing the safety and shelf life of food products. Food packaging produced from natural resources, such as cellulose, chitosan, gelatin, pectin, and soy protein, has been developed as alternatives to conventional packaging materials due to their biodegradability and low toxicity (Mangaraj, Yadav, Bal, Dash, & Mahanti, 2019; Yu et al., 2018). However, these biopolymers often exhibit reduced mechanical strength and low environmental stability. These limitations could be improved upon by using different approaches, including polymer blending, addition of nanofillers, chemical modifications, and incorporation of natural plasticizers (Arrieta, de Dicastillo, Garrido, Roa, & Galotto, 2018; Garavand, Rouhi, Razavi, Cacciotti, & Mohammadi, 2017; Jayakumar et al., 2019). Chitosan (CS) can be utilized for active packaging applications due to its excellent biological and film-forming properties (Choo, Ching, Chuah, Julai, & Liou, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). However, CS films suffer from certain drawbacks, including low tensile strength and water barrier properties. The thermal degradation of CS at above 200–220 °C also indicates a limited thermal stability of the biopolymer, which could restrict its packaging applications (Grząbka-Zasadzińska, Amietszajew, & Borysiak, 2017). Polymer blending of CS and PVOH was reported to enhance the physical, thermal and barrier properties, while preserving the intrinsic characteristics of CS films (Narasagoudr, Hegde, Vanjeri, Chougale, & Masti, 2020). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) is a synthetic semicrystalline polymer, which has a great film-forming ability and excellent characteristics, including high tensile and barrier properties, biocompatibility, and strong protection against many alkaline and acidic solvents (Haghighi et al., 2020). PVOH is potentially miscible with hydrophilic polymers, particularly CS, due to its abundance of hydroxyl groups. Film production using PVOH and CS is an effective method to gain desired properties, particularly as related to tensile properties and cost performance ratio (Bonilla, Fortunati, Atarés, Chiralt, & Kenny, 2014; Srinivasa, Ramesh, Kumar, & Tharanathan, 2003; Tripathi, Mehrotra, & Dutta, 2009). Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), an abundant polysaccharide, has a similar structure to celluloses from plants and vegetables. However, BNC is more effective as a reinforcing agent for the development of composite films due to its stronger reinforcing effects, such as higher tensile strength and degree of polymerization (Salari, Khiabani, Mokarram, Ghanbarzadeh, & Kafil, 2018). For instance, polylactic acid (PLA) composite films incorporated with as low as 0.5–1.0% (w/w) of BNC showed higher mechanical properties and stronger water vapor barrier properties than pure PLA and PLA/cellulose nanofibrils films (Gitari, Chang, Misra, Navabi, & Mohanty, 2019). To further enhance the overall properties of the composite films, the surface properties of BNC can be modified to improve the interfacial adhesion between the filler and the polymer matrix. Thus, improvements can be made through various surface modification techniques, including oxidation, silane grafting, acylation and incorporation of nanoparticles (Frone et al., 2018; Somord et al., 2018; Spaic, Small, Cook, & Wan, 2014; Wang et al., 2020). By introducing functional groups into BNC, its properties can be modified and, thus, improving the compatibility to the polymer matrix. The incorporation of silane-modified nanocellulose to PLA composite films improved the tensile properties, heat stability, light barrier property, and air permeability of the films (Jin, Tang, Zhu, & Zhou, 2020; Qian, Sheng, Yu, Xu, & Lopez, 2018). Also, Chanda et al. (2021) reported the enhanced dispersion, thermal and mechanical properties of polyethylene oxide films by incorporating silane-modified cellulose nanocrystals. The previous results showed that silane modification of nanocellulose allows them to be compatible with hydrophobic as wells as hydrophilic polymer matrices. However, due to the lack of antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, additional functional materials must be added for the development of active packaging films. Food additives have been incorporated in composite films for many purposes, including to improve the food texture, color, and flavor, as well as to control the growth of microorganisms during storage. Examples of these food additives are nisin, ethyl lauryl arginate, essential oils (EO), organic acids and their salts, natural antioxidants, and antimicrobials (Haghighi et al., 2020; Jin, Liu, Zhang, & Hicks, 2009; Valencia-Chamorro, Palou, Del Rio, & Perez-Gago, 2008; Zhao, Xiong, Zhou, & Xiao, 2019). Among them, 4-hexylresorcinol (4-HR) has been commonly used for prevention of melanosis in shrimps and other crustaceans (Gonçalves & de Oliveira, 2016). This antioxidant has been approved as a food additive in the EU and many countries, such as Canada, Brazil, and Australia for specified use in crustaceans (Selçuk & Özden, 2017). It was reported that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) films incorporated with a low concentration of 0.4% (w/w) 4-HR showed excellent antimicrobial activity (Kemme & Heinzel-Wieland, 2018). However, little research has been conducted to produce composite films incorporated with the active compound as a novel method to enhance food quality and safety. The goals of this study were to produce antioxidative PVOH/CS composite films incorporated with aminosilane-modified BNC (mBNC) and 4-HR using a solution casting technique. The morphological, physical, mechanical, and barrier properties of the films were studied using different mechanical and analytical techniques. The filling effects of 4-HR on the antioxidant properties of the films were determined using ABTS and DPPH techniques. The effects of the composite films on the shelf-life of vacuum-packaged refrigerated raw beef were also investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Medium molecular weight CS (degree of deacetylation 75–85%), citric acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). PVOH (average MW 85,000–120,000, 88% hydrolyzed), n-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AAPS), anhydrous CaCl2, and potassium persulfate were from ACROS Organics™ (Fair Lawn, NJ) and 4-HR was purchased from Alfa Aesar™ (Tewksbury, MA). Glucose, Na2HPO4, NaOH, NaCl and methanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical was supplied by TCI America (Portland, OR)."
3,Production of mBNC,"2.2 Production of mBNC BNC was produced using Hestrin and Schramm (HS) medium based on our previous method (Wang et al., 2020). In 500 mL of deionized water, 10 g glucose, 2.5 g yeast extract, 2.5 g peptone, 1.35 g Na2HPO4, and 0.75 g citric acid were mixed to make the culture medium. BNC was produced using a static incubation method of Gluconobacter xylinus ATCC 53582 in HS medium at 25 °C. After one week of cultivation, a BNC layer was formed on the surface of the medium. The BNC was removed and added into deionized water at 70 °C for 3 h, followed by treatment with NaOH solution (0.1 M) at 70 °C for 1.5 h. To remove unwanted materials, the BNC was washed with deionized water until the pH adjusted to 7.0. The modified BNC (mBNC) was produced via polycondensation of alkoxysilane using AAPS based on a previous technique with slight modifications (Shao et al., 2017). Briefly, the BNC was cut into square 2.5 cm2 pieces and soaked in a 10% (w/w) AAPS in ethanol solution. The mixture solution was slowly stirred at room temperature for 4 h. To remove impurities and unreacted AAPS, the mBNC was washed with ethanol. The mBNC slurry was prepared by blending at high speed (120 V, 60 Hz and 3.0 amps) for 0.5 h using a Waring commercial blender (Model 51BL31, New Hartford, CT, USA)."
4,Preparation of composite films,"2.3 Preparation of composite films PVOH crystals were dissolved in distilled water at 80 °C with constant stirring to make a 5% (w/w) PVOH solution. A 1% (w/w) CS solution was prepared by dissolving CS powder in 1% (w/w) acetic acid solution at 80 °C for 1.5 h under constant stirring. Both solutions were cooled to room temperature, followed by mixing in a 1:1 ratio until the development of a homogeneous suspension. 4-HR was dissolved in DMSO to obtain a 50 mg/g solution before adding into the film-forming solution (FFS), and the mixture stirred for 10 min. While stirring, 4% (w/w) of mBNC was added into the FFS. Five types of composite suspensions were prepared: PVOH/CS/mBNC without the incorporation of 4-HR (PCB) and PVOH/CS/mBNC incorporated with various concentrations of 4-HR, viz., 2.5 wt% (PCBH-2.5), 5.0 wt% (PCBH-5.0), 7.5 wt% (PCBH-7.5), and 10.0 wt% (PCBH-10.0). PVOH/CS films without the incorporation of mBNC or 4-HR (PC) were used as the control. Next, 75 g of FFS were transferred onto sterile square-shaped 12 cm2 petri dish and left overnight at room temperature before drying in an oven at 45 °C for 1–2 days."
5,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) An environmental SEM (Quanta 600 FEG; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) was used to investigate the morphological properties of the PVOH/CS composite films. The films (1 cm2) were mounted on aluminum stubs, followed by sputter-coating with a 10 nm gold layer before SEM observation. The film samples were scanned using an Everhart-Thornley secondary electron detector under a high-vacuum mode at 5.0 kV (surface morphology of films) or 10.0 kV (cross-sections of films)."
6,Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,"2.5 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy The films were studied using an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 380, Thermo, USA). FTIR spectra were obtained by scanning in the wavelength range of 4000–400 cm−1 with 4.0 cm−1 spectral resolution."
7,"Color, light transmittance, and opacity","2.6 Color, light transmittance, and opacity The film color was measured using a colorimeter (CR-410, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Japan). The total color difference (∆E) of the films was determined based on the L*, a*, and b* values measured. Light transmittance of the films was measured using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 50, Varian, Inc., USA). The transmittance of 0.8 cm × 3.5 cm films at 600 nm was recorded. A test cell without the films was used as the blank. The film opacity was determined based on an earlier method (Yu et al., 2019) using the following equation: Opacity = − log Trans 600 K where Trans 600 is the transmittance of the films at 600 nm and K is the film thickness (mm) determined at five different locations using a digital electronic caliper."
8,Moisture content (MC) and water solubility (WS),"2.7 Moisture content (MC) and water solubility (WS) MC of the films was evaluated as the weight loss percentage after drying, based on a previous method (Valizadeh, Naseri, Babaei, Hosseini, & Imani, 2019). The films were cut into square 25 mm2 pieces, followed by oven-drying at 105 °C for 24 h. The initial and final weights of the films were recorded for the measurement of MC as shown below: MC % = ( Initial film weight − Final film weight ) Initial film weight × 100 WS of the film samples was evaluated according to a previous method with slight modifications (Valizadeh et al., 2019). The oven-dried films were placed in 50 mL distilled water for 24 h. The films were then collected and oven-dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The initial and final weights of the dried films were recorded for the measurement of WS, using the following formula: WS % = ( Initial dried film weight − Final dried film weight ) Initial dried film weight × 100"
9,Tensile properties,"2.8 Tensile properties Tensile studies were conducted using a texture analyzer (TA-XT2i, Texture Technologies Corp., USA). Film samples were cut into 1 cm × 5 cm rectangular strips before subjecting them to the tensile measurement. The crosshead speed and initial grip separation were set at 0.5 mm/s and 25 mm, respectively."
10,Water vapor permeability (WVP),"2.9 Water vapor permeability (WVP) WVP of the film samples was studied based on an earlier method (Wu, Deng, Luo, & Deng, 2019). First, 15 g of anhydrous CaCl2 were added into a beaker, which was covered by the film samples and sealed using parafilm. The wrapped beaker was placed in a humid (75% RH at 25 °C) desiccator that contained saturated NaCl solution. For up to 12 h, the weight of the beaker was monitored at various intervals. WVP was measured based on the equation: WVP = ( ∆ M × K ) / ( ∆ P × t × S ) where ∆ M is the weight variation (g), K is the film thickness (m), ∆ P is the vapor pressure difference across the film (Pa), t is the time, and S is the vapor exposed area under test (m2)."
11,Antioxidant properties,"2.10 Antioxidant properties The antioxidant properties of the films were measured based on an earlier method with slight modifications (Yu et al., 2019). First, the films with a dimension of 10 mm × 50 mm, were incubated in 5 mL of 70% and 95% methanol solutions for 24 h. Then, the film extract solution was subjected to DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. For the DPPH assay, the film extract solution (2 mL) was mixed with methanolic DPPH solution (2 mL, 0.1 mM) before keeping it in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer. For the ABTS assay, ABTS (7 mM) was first added in a potassium persulfate solution (2.45 mM) before keeping in the dark for 16 h. Methanol was added to make a diluted solution with an absorbance value of about 0.7 at 734 nm. Then, the diluted solution (3.96 mL) was mixed with the film extract solution (40 µL) and the mixture kept in the dark for 6 min. The absorbance value was measured at 734 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The following equation was used to determine the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity: Scavenging activity % = ( Abs control − Abs sample ) Abs control × 100 where Abs control and Abs sample are the absorbances of the control and sample, respectively. 2.10.1 Application study on vacuum-packaged beef samples Beef samples, cut to a dimension of 15 mm3, were wrapped with the films before packaging them in vacuum-seal bags using a vacuum sealer (Model FoodSaver BagVac™, Tilia, Inc., USA). All the vacuum-packaged beef (PB) samples were kept at 4 °C for a maximum of two weeks. Unwrapped beef samples with and without vacuum-packaging were used as the controls. The beef samples were pulled out from the packages at predetermined periods, viz., 4, 7, 10, and 14 days after storage. Then, each sample was placed in sterile stomacher bags that contained 99 mL of 0.1% peptone water (pH=7.2). A Stomacher™ Circulator (Model 400, Seward™, UK) was used to homogenize the samples. The homogenates were diluted with peptone water before pour-plating with tryptic soy agar (TSA) on sterile petri dishes. All the plates were then placed in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 h and bacterial colonies on each plate were enumerated."
12,Statistical analysis,2.11 Statistical analysis All experiments were conducted at least thrice with duplicate (beef studies) or triplicate (all other studies) samples. The collected data were expressed as means ± standard deviations. Data analyses were performed through one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test was conducted by Minitab software (Version 19). A significant difference between mean values was represented by P ≤ 0.05.
13,Results and discussion,
14,Film microstructure,"3.1 Film microstructure The PC film’s surface was homogeneous and smooth without phase separation, indicating that the PVOH and CS were homogenously mixed ( Fig. 1A). Compared to the surface morphology of the PC film, the PCB film showed a rougher surface with the presence of streaks or ribbed lines (Fig. 1B). The incorporation of mBNCs in the film resulted in a slight aggregation of these compounds that appeared as white dots and streaks (Fig. 1B). By incorporating 4-HR into the PCB film, the surface became rougher, as shown in Fig. 1C. As more 4-HR was added, the level of ridges and ripples in the film increased due to aggregation of the organic compound in the polymer matrix (Fig. 1D). In Fig. 1E, the cross-sectional morphology of the PC film showed a homogenous surface without pores and cracks. When mBNCs were added into the film, these compounds aggregated and appeared as white dots or streaks (Fig. 1F). Also, pores were formed in the microstructure of the PCB film, which could be attributed to air trapped in the film during drying (Jahed, Khaledabad, Almasi, & Hasanzadeh, 2017). By adding 4-HR into the film, the aggregation of mBNCs was reduced in these areas as fewer white streaks or spots were observed in the SEM micrographs (Fig. 1G–H). This could be due to the emulsifying effect of DMSO, which resulted in better dispersion of 4-HR and mBNCs in the film (Ortiz, Salgado, Dufresne & Mauri, 2018). Compared to PCBH-5.0, the transverse section of PCBH-10.0 film (Fig. 1H) showed more wrinkles and ripples, which could be due to an increased density of crack deflection sites (Tian, Yan, Lu, & Jiang, 2017)."
15,FTIR,"3.2 FTIR The FTIR spectrum of the PC film showed a broad and strong absorption band at 3277 cm−1, which was attributed to an overlapping of both O-H and N-H stretching vibrations, indicating the formation of a strong hydrogen bonding between PVOH and CS ( Fig. 2). Also, the FTIR spectrum showed C-H stretching (2916 cm−1), CO ester stretching (1714 cm−1), amide I (1647 cm−1), amide II (1566 cm−1), CH and CH2 bending (1248 cm−1), C-O stretching (1090 cm−1 and 1031 cm−1), and C-C stretching (847 cm−1) (Choo et al., 2016; Lan et al., 2020). In the spectrum of the PCB film, the absorption bands at 4000–3300 cm−1 were strongly fluctuated, indicating the coupling reaction between the hydroxyl groups of mBNCs and AAPS, that resulted in the production of a hydroxyl association peak (Jin et al., 2020). Compared to the PC film, the O-H stretching band of the PCB film was broader due to the increased formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PVOH, CS and mBNCs. The vibration of Si-O-C was attributed to a new absorption peak at 1143 cm−1, suggesting a condensation reaction between silanol and hydroxyl groups of BNC (Qian & Sheng, 2017). Due to a weaker intensity of these peaks, they can be overlapped by other strong absorption bands, such as a C-O stretching band, resulting in difficult peak analysis. Upon the addition of 4-HR into the film, several new peaks were formed in the spectra of PCBH-5.0 and PCBH-10.0. For instance, the aromatic C-H stretching peak was observed at 3008 cm−1. The characteristic peaks at 1615 cm−1 and 1522 cm−1 were attributed to the aromatic ring stretching vibration. The aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending was assigned to the band at 705 cm−1. Compared to the PC and PCB, the peak at 1012 cm−1 was more intense due to the C-O vibration of 4-HR (Jo et al., 2017). The results suggested that mBNCs and 4-HR were successfully incorporated into the film. The FTIR results were in agreement with those of Yang, Ha, Kim, and Chae (2016)."
16,Color and opacity,"3.3 Color and opacity The incorporation of mBNCs had no significant effect on the redness of the PC film ( Table 1). Compared to the PC film, the PCB film showed an increase in yellowness and a slight decrease in lightness, which could be due to the incorporation of mBNCs that are white-yellowish in color. It was reported that rice starch films with increased yellowness and reduced lightness were produced upon the incorporation of silane-modified palm pressed fiber (PPF) compared to unmodified PPF (Phattaraporn, Waranyou, & Thawien, 2011). Also, the addition of silane-modified cellulose nanofibers produced a PLA composite that was yellower, as reported by Robles, Urruzola, Labidi, and Serrano (2015). When 4-HR was added, the films showed an increase in redness (higher a* value) and a slight decrease in lightness and yellowness. The increase in redness could be due to the addition of the pale red colored 4-HR solution into the films. The incorporation of mBNCs and 4-HR increased the ∆E values of the films. This behavior might be attributed to the decrease in the L* value and increase in film thickness, and a* and b* values. Without the incorporation of mBNCs and 4-HR, the PC film was visually clear and transparent. The film opacity increased after the addition of mBNCs and 4-HR, indicating a lower film transparency than the PC film (Table 1). The opacity values might be affected by the film thickness. It was observed that the film opacity increased with increasing film thickness. A similar behavior was also found by Galdeano, Wilhelm, Mali, and Grossmann (2013) using plasticized oat starch films. When a higher concentration of 4-HR was added, the film opacity slightly increased, which could be due to the incorporation of the hydrophobic material into the film. It might be due to a higher degree of crosslinking in the polymer matrix, reducing the interchain spacing in the polymer that, in turn, decreases the intensity of light passing through the film (Bierhalz, da Silva, & Kieckbusch, 2012). The opacity difference between the PCB films, with and without incorporation of 4-HR, is negligible. It could be due to only a small amount of 4-HR that was added into the film. Due to the color change and lower transparency of the films, subsequently packaged foods may have higher UV and visible light barrier properties, resulting in better protection of their flavor, color and nutrients."
17,MC and WS,"3.4 MC and WS The MC of the films is defined by the total amount of water that occupies the empty volume of a film’s microstructure (Haghigh et al., 2019). Upon the addition of mBNCs, the MC of the PC film decreased by 13.4% ( Table 2). This could be due to a higher degree of physical crosslinking and hydrogen bonding interaction between PVOH, CS and mBNCs. The findings were similar to those of Zhang et al. (2016). The MC of the films incorporated with 4-HR was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) compared to those of the PC and PCB films. As expected, the MC of the films significantly increased (P ≤ 0.05) as a higher concentration of 4-HR was added. This could be due to the amphiphilic properties of 4-HR that allowed the hydrophilic moieties to interact with water. The film thickness is an important parameter for evaluating the MC of the films. The MC of the films were increased with increasing film thickness. The increase in film thickness may allow more hydrophilic groups of 4-HR to interact with water. A similar result was also reported by Mali, Grossmann, Garcı́a, Martino, and Zaritzky (2004) using plasticized yam starch films. The WS of the PC film increased by 34.0% after the incorporation of mBNCs, which could be due to the presence of hydrophilic R-groups on the silane coupling agents that allowed them to interact with water (Table 2). Further, agglomeration of mBNCs may allow water molecules to enter and interact with the film more freely, resulting in a higher WS value (Zhang, Lu, Fan, Jiang, & Dong, 2019). In contrast, it was reported that water absorption of a soy protein isolate-based film decreased upon the incorporation of 1.23% silane-modified cellulose nanocrystals (Zhang et al., 2016). The WS of the composite films may greatly depend on the concentration and hydrophilic moieties of the modified nanocellulose. When 4-HR was added, the WS of the films was significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05). Compared to the other films, PCBH-10.0 had the lowest WS as the film hydrophilicity was decreased with the addition of 4-HR. The decrease in WS could also be due to the emulsifying effect of DMSO in the polymer matrix, which decreases the interaction between PVOH, CS, mBNCs, and 4-HR. Similarly, the WS of CS-thyme EO films was reduced with the addition of emulsifying agents (Lian, Peng, Shi, & Wang, 2019)."
18,Tensile properties,"3.5 Tensile properties The tensile strength (TS) of the PCB film was slightly improved compared to that of the PC film (Table 2). The TS of the film could be affected by various factors, including the crosslinking interaction between active groups on the surface of the nanofiller with the polymer matrix and the degree of agglomeration due to interactions between nanofillers in the polymer matrix (Zhang et al., 2019). Phattaraporn et al. (2011) reported that upon the addition of silane-treated PPF, the TS of rice starch film gradually increased, but it decreased when the concentration of PPF was 40%. Here, the TS of the film was slightly improved, which could be due to agglomeration of mBNCs, as confirmed by the SEM results (Fig. 1). The elongation at break (EAB) of the film was decreased by 14.9% upon the incorporation of mBNCs (Table 2). The reinforcement of nanocellulose produces films with improved continuity within the polymer matrix, which reduces the chain mobility, leading to increased film hardness and stiffness (Asad et al., 2018). Lee, You, Jin, and Kwak (2020) similarly reported that the EAB of a PVOH film was reduced upon the addition of dialdehyde-modified cellulose nanocrystals. When 4-HR was added, the TS of the film was significantly reduced (P ≤ 0.05). The TS of the PCB film significantly decreased, while the EAB of the PCB film increased significantly, indicating that the 4-HR worked as a plasticizer in the composite film. A similar result was observed in gelatin films incorporated with resorcinol (Bang, Shankar, & Rhim, 2019). Also, the PCB film had higher flexibility and lower rigidity with the addition of a plasticizer (e.g., DMSO). This could be due to the decreased formation of the intermolecular Van der Waals forces between the polymers and increased formation of the intermolecular bond between the polymers and plasticizer. It was reported that the increase in plasticizer content improved the elongation of bioplastic produced from microalgae (Dianursanti, Gozan, & Noviasari, 2018). When 4-HR was added into the PCB film, the EAB of the films was increased, which could be due to the plasticizing effects caused by the presence of residual solvents in the films. These findings were similar to that of Bochek et al. (2011)."
19,WVP,"3.6 WVP WVP is an important parameter for barrier properties of packaging films which depends on various factors, including the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic group, cracks, tortuosity, and porosity in the film. The incorporation of mBNCs considerably lowered the WVP of the PCB film by 29.1% (Table 2). This could be because of a reduction in water absorptivity of mBNCs due to covalent or hydrogen bonding interactions between the silane coupling agent with the free hydroxyl groups on the surface of mBNCs (Demir, Atikler, Balköse, & Tıhmınlıoğlu, 2006). As more 4-HR was added, the WVP of the film gradually increased. The increased amount of plasticizer improved the flexibility and mobility of the polymer network chains, leading to the formation of a looser network in the polymer matrix. The structural changes in the polymer matrix could lead to the increase in WVP values. Similar findings were reported when other plasticizers, such as sorbitol, glycerol, and Tween 80 were incorporated into CS films (Patricia Miranda, Garnica, Lara-Sagahon, & Cárdenas, 2004)."
20,Antioxidant properties,"3.7 Antioxidant properties Both the PC and PCB films showed weak ABTS and DPPH radical-scavenging activities. in the tested food simulants ( Fig. 3). The residual free amino groups on the surfaces of CS and mBNCs react with free radicals to produce stable macromolecule radicals, contributing to the film scavenging activities (Jahed, Khaledabad, Almasi, et al., 2017). The PC and PCB films showed higher DPPH-radical scavenging activities than ABTS-radical scavenging activities (Fig. 3A). This could be due to the pH-dependent DPPH cation, which is highly unstable in acidic media. It was reported that the presence of acidic solvents may result in false-positive results in a DPPH radical-scavenging assay (Ferri, Gianotti, & Tassoni, 2013). After the addition of 4-HR into the films, the scavenging activities of the films were enhanced against ABTS and DPPH radicals. In both food stimulants, PCBH-2.5 film showed strong ABTS and DPPH radical-scavenging activities, even when a low concentration of 4-HR was added. When more 4-HR was added, the DPPH and ABTS radical-scavenging activities of the films (e.g., PCBH-5.0, PCBH-7.5, and PCBH-10.0) remained at similar levels. These strong scavenging activities could be due to the ability of 4-HR to donate a proton by phenolic hydrogen to free radicals. Because of the amphiphilic properties of 4-HR, the oxidation reaction of proteins and lipids could also be reduced, resulting in a higher quality of packaged food products (Fidalgo, Deglesne, Arroya, Ranneva, & Deprez, 2018). Thus, the high concentration of phenolic constituents in 4-HR greatly contributed to the strong antioxidant properties of the films. 3.7.1 Application study on vacuum-packaged beef samples Raw beef samples without vacuum packaging film were used as the control. Compared to the control, all the PB samples had lower bacterial counts after two weeks of storage ( Fig. 4). At day 4, the bacterial counts of the control and PB sample without film were 7.7 and 6.5 log CFU/g, respectively. Compared to those films, the microbial load of PB samples wrapped with PC film was reduced by about 2–3 log CFU/g during storage. At days 4 and 14, the PCB film significantly decreased the bacterial loads of PB samples (P ≤ 0.05). Also, the bacterial loads of PB samples wrapped with all the 4-HR-incorporated PCB films were below the limit of detection, which was 1 log CFU/g. However, the bacterial load of PB samples with PCBH-2.5 increased above the limit of detection to 4.8 log CFU/g at day 14. Further, the bacterial loads of PB samples without film were maintained at 6.5–6.7 log CFU/g during storage. All the bacterial loads of beef samples at days 7, 10, and 14 followed the decreasing trend of bacterial loads at day 4 (Fig. 4). The bacterial loads of PB samples wrapped with all the tested films were below those of the PB samples without film, suggesting that all the composite films were effective in inhibiting and retarding bacterial growth under vacuum packaging conditions. Similarly, other researchers reported the applications of vacuum packaging and CS coating to improve the shelf-life of refrigerated beef (Duran & Kahve, 2020) and grilled pork samples (Yingyuad et al., 2006) at refrigeration temperature. In this work, an anaerobic environment was achieved by applying vacuum packaging to the food products. Vacuum packaging inhibits the growth of aerobic spoilage microorganisms, resulting in a lower rate of food spoilage. Also, the positively-charged amino groups on the surfaces of CS and mBNCs can interact with the negatively-charged cell membranes of the spoilage bacteria, resulting in cell damage and leakage of cellular materials (Fernandes et al., 2013; Yingyuad et al., 2006). Upon the addition of 4-HR, the antimicrobial activities of the films were significantly improved (p ≤ 0.05). This could be due to the capability of 4-HR to penetrate bacterial cell membranes and interact with the cell nucleus and proteins, as confirmed by the SEM results (Fig. 1)."
21,Conclusions,"In this study, mBNCs were produced by grafting aminosilane groups onto the surface of BNCs through a polycondensation reaction. Using a solution-casting method, PC-based composite films were developed with the addition of mBNCs and 4-HR. SEM and FTIR results confirmed that the morphological properties and chemical structure of the films were affected by the incorporation of mBNCs and 4-HR. The addition of mBNCs and 4-HR improved the redness, yellowness, opacity, and MC of the films. However, the brightness and WS of the PC films were decreased upon the addition of mBNCs and 4-HR. The mechanical test and WVP results showed that the addition of mBNCs and 4-HR produced films with higher flexibility, less rigidity, and lower water vapor barrier properties compared to the pure PC film, due to the plasticizing effect. The antioxidant activity of the films was improved with the incorporation of 4-HR due to the presence of phenolic hydrogens that could interact with the free radicals. Using vacuum packaging, the growth of bacteria on refrigerated raw beef was inhibited and food spoilage was retarded, resulting in an increased shelf-life of raw beef samples. Consequently, the results showed that the PC/mBNCs/4-HR film has a great potential to be utilized as an active food packaging material, due to the enhanced film flexibility, with excellent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of CS, mBNCs, and 4-HR.(Agulló, Rodríguez, Ramos, & Albertengo, 2003)."
