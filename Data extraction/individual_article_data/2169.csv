0,Introduction：,"Because of the energy and environmental crisis caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels, it is necessary to develop clean and renewable energy to promote sustainable development [1]. Hydrogen energy as a high energy density, zero carbon emission and clean energy is considered to be one of the most competitive alternatives to fossil fuels [2,3]. Electrocatalytic water splitting is considered to be one of the most promising green hydrogen production pathways due to its wide source of raw materials and high efficiency. However, due to the existence of hydrogen evolution overpotential, a large amount of energy will inevitably be consumed in the process [4,5]. The noble metals (e.g. Pt) are still the state of art electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but their high cost and scarcity severely impede their widespread use in industrial application. Hence, developing an economical, efficient and stable electrocatalyst is of great significance for industrial hydrogen production [6,7]. Among many electrocatalyst materials for sustainable and efficient hydrogen production, MoS2 have been widely studied as electrocatalyst because of its unique two-dimensional structure, abundant catalytic active sites and low H adsorption free energy [8]. However, most of the active sites of MoS2 mainly came from the S-Mo edge rather than the basal surface, and MoS2 has poor conductivity, which greatly limits its catalytic performance [9,10]. Further improving its activity in practical applications remains a great challenge [11,12]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with remarkable structural tunability and modifiable physicochemical properties, which have attracted considerable attention over the last several years [13,14]. At present, MOFs has been widely studied for realizing better gas storage, catalysis, gas separation and drug delivery. Gamze Yilmaz etc. proposed a structure-directing metal organic framework to coordinate functional metal centers that stimulate catalytic activity of the passive in-plane basal MoS2 domains. As a result, exceptional catalytic activity and stability were achieved [15]. C@MoS2 composite was prepared by Jianhui Feng et al. The enhanced HER activity can be attributed to the unique core-shell structure, where abundant active edge sites of MoS2 are exposed and the underlying carbon substrate effectively improves the conductivity of the electrode [16]. As a crucial subclass of MOFs, rare-earth based metal−organic frameworks (RE-MOFs) have been successfully employed in different fields such as catalysis [17], magnetism [18] and luminescence [19], However, it is rarely used in the field of electrocatalysis, partly because of its weak intrinsic catalytic ability [20]. Herein, we report Er based metal organic framework (Er-MOF) synthesized using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Erbium trinitrate pentahydrate by a solvothermal method. MoS₂ was then combined with the as-synthesized compounds to prepare Er-MOF/MoS2 catalyst by hydrothermal method. Compared with MoS2, Er-MOF/MoS2 has better HER performance with smaller Tafel slope (54.3 mV dec−1) and the initial potential at 10 mA cm−2 of Er-MOF/MoS2 is more positive than that of MoS2. This work provides a valuable and new method for designing efficient electrocatalysts for clean energy production and conversion."

When the addition amount of Er-MOF was changed to 50 mg and 150 mg, the obtained product was named Er-MOF/MoS2-50 and Er-MOF/MoS2-150."
6,Catalysts characterizations,"2.5 Catalysts characterizations XRD were collected by SHIMADZU XRD-6100 with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154203 nm) operating at 40 kV and scanning speed 5°/min, the step size was 0.02°, and the 2θ values ranged from 10° to 80°. The XPS profiles were recorded on an ESCALAB-MKII 250 photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation. The surface morphology and ellemental composition of the catalyst were analyzed by SEM (JSM-6610) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) detector and FESEM (JSM-78OOF)."
7,Electrochemical measurements,"2.6 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, CHI760E, Shanghai) using a typical three-electrode cell at room temperature. A carbon rod, an saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3.0 mm in diameter) coated with the synthesized catalyst ink were employed as counter, reference and working electrode, respectively. All potential values have been calibrated to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (see equation (1)) [25]: (1) Ε ( V v s . RHE ) = 0.0591 * p H + 0.1976 + Ε ( V v s . Ag / AgCl ) The catalyst ink was prepared according to the following procedures: 5.0 mg of as-prepared catalyst was ultrasonicated in 1 mL alcohol till create a homogeneous ink. Then 3 μL of this slurry was deposited on the glassy carbon electrode (loading amount: ~0.212 mg cm−2). After drying naturally, 3 μL of 0.5% Nafion solution was added and then dried completely. Prior to each electrocatalytic experiment, the electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4, 100 mL) was saturated with nitrogen (N2). HER was acquired by LSV in a potential range of 0 to − 1.0 V with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The slope of the Tafel curve was calculated from the LSV curve through Tafel formula (see equation (2)) The CV tests was measured at different scanning rates in the potential range of − 0.05–0.05 V. The impedance measurements were conducted in the same configuration from 0.1 to 100,000 Hz. (2) η = a + blog│j│ In which η denotes the applied overpotential, j is the current density, b (mV dec−1) is the Tafel slope and a is intercept."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the materials,"3.1 Characterization of the materials XRD was used to identify the phase structure and purity of the samples. The results are as shown in Fig. 1a. The synthesized MoS2 can be indexed as MoS2 [16]. The Er-MOF synthesized is consistent with the Er-MOF of XRD [21]. When Er-MOF/MoS2 is compared with MoS2, it is found that Er-MOF/MoS2 has a more obvious peak at 26.4°. It is a standard carbon peak, the peak comes from Er-MOF, which preliminarily indicating that Er-MOF/MoS2 has been successfully compounded. Also indicating that the carbonization degree of Er-MOF is deepened. The FE-SEM images of Er-MOF/MoS2, MoS2 and Er-MOF were given. As shown in Fig. 1b–d, Er-MOF has a scale of several microns. The surface of MoS2 has a great quantity of folds on the surface, which is conducive to the exposure of catalytic active sites. The size and morphology of the MoS2 are not relatively uniform. It can be seen from the Er-MOF/MoS2 diagram that the morphology of structure is very fragmented and chaotic, and it is a microporous structure larger than Er-MOF. Due to it has many microporous structures, which the micropores of Er-MOF/MoS2 can transport electrolyte to the catalytic surface. Thereby, the adhesion of gas-solid interface is reduced and the release of bubbles (H2) generated on the catalyst surface is promoted. As shown in Fig. 2a, EDS maps revealing the homogeneous distribution of Mo, S, Er, O and C elements over all the Er-MOF/MoS2. XPS measurements were carried out to analyze the surface chemical compositions and oxidation states of Er-MOF/MoS2. The full curve XPS spectra confirms the presence of Er, C, O, Mo and S elements in Er-MOF/MoS2 (Fig. 2c). As displayed in Fig. 2d, the C 1s peak spectra is deconvoluted into two peaks at 284.8 and 286.1 eV. Compared with the XPS of carbon elements of Er-MOF and MoS2(Figs. S1, S2), the carbon element in Er-MOF/MoS2 exists in the form of organic C, Carbon loses oxygen atoms and the degree of graphitization deepens. The 4d peak of Er element coincides with the 2p peak of S element, which shows the presence of Er-MOF. As displayed in Fig. 2f, S 2p peak spectra shows three peak which is due to the formation of sulfide (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks with the binding energies of 161.97 and 163.25 eV, respectively), and there are also exist lower-valence S-O bond (168.4 eV) within Er-MOF/MoS2 structure [26]. The Mo 3d peak spectra is deconvoluted into four peaks at 236.1, 233.4, 232.6, and 229.2 eV corresponding to Mo6+ 3d3/2, Mo6+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2, and Mo4+ 3d5/2, respectively [26,27]. In addition, Mo6+ can be assigned to the high-oxidation-state of Mo species (MoO3) due to the surface oxidation of MoS2. The XPS of Mo and S shows the successful preparation of MoS2. There, such results manifest that the MoS2 lamellas have been introduced into the Er-MOF system successfully."
10,Electrochemical hydrogen evolution properties,"3.2 Electrochemical hydrogen evolution properties HER performance was first investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution to examine the electrocatalytic activity of Er-MOF/MoS2. The catalytic activity of MoS2 and Er-MOF were also measured for comparison. At the same current density (10 mA cm−2), the lower overpotential of the catalyst (η10), the higher of HER activity. As shown in Fig. 3a, the LSV curves of the materials revealed pronounced differences in the HER activity. Obviously, It can be seen from the figure that Er-MOF performance worst catalytic activity, requiring a large η10 of 790 mV. In contrast, the HER activity of MoS2 was significantly higher, with an overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, when MoS2 is loaded on MOF material, the Er-MOF/MoS2 showed the best HER performance, which the η10 reduce by 93–234 mV compared to MoS2. Compared with MoS2, Er-MOF/MoS2, Er-MOF/MoS2-50, Er-MOF/MoS2-150, Er-MOF/MoS2 has better properties of active hydrogen evolution reaction. This indicates that the addition of MoS2 to Er-MOF can effectively improve the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction. If the amount of Er MOF relative to MoS2 is too large, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance will decline. Calculating the slope of Tafel curve derived from LSV curves can be utilize to understand the underlying HER mechanism of atalyst. A smaller Tafel slope indicates more favorable HER kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3b, Tafel curves of Er-MOF, MoS2 and Er-MOF/MoS2 catalyst are given according to LSV curve. The Tafel slopes using to analyze the HER kinetic behavior were fitted by Tafel formula. The Tafel slope represents an important parameter to understand the HER reaction pathways. In principle, HER in alkaline electrolyte involves three typical steps: (1) Volmer reaction: H2O + e- * → H* + OH-, (2) Heyrovsky reaction: H* + H2O + e- →H2 + OH- + *, and/or (3) Tafel reaction: H* + H* → H2 + 2 * . The Tafel slope of Er-MOF/MoS2 (54.3 mV dec−1) indicates that the HER process on the Er-MOF/MoS2 catalyst obeys the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [28]. Hydrogen desorption is the rate limiting step. The Tafel slope of Er-MOF/MoS2 (55.9 mV dec−1) is the smallest compared to MoS2 (69.9 mV dec−1) and Er-MOF(133.4 mV dec−1), which is also consistent with the HER performance of electrocatalyst. The increased catalytic activity may be attributed to the synergistic effects between MoS2 and Er-MOF interfacial region. Moreover, the hierarchical structure with coarse surfaces can offer a lot of catalytic active sites for HER and the porous structure of MOF can reduce the adhesion of gas-solid interface and promote the release of bubbles (H2) generated. To evaluate the active surface areas (ECSA), the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the samples was calculated via various scan rates of CV in the non Faraday reaction range. The CV curves of Er-MOF/MoS2 and MoS2 are shown in the Fig. 3c–d. Er-MOF/MoS2 has higher current density and area. Under the same conditions, the redox peak of Er-MOF/MoS2 is higher than that of MoS2. The Cdl value of Er-MOF/MoS2, MoS2 and Er-MOF were 31.5 mF cm−2, 12.3 mF cm−2 and 0.13 mF cm−2 respectively. The higher the ECSA value, the higher the catalytic activity. The ECSA of Er-MOF/MoS2 is larger than that of MoS2 and Er-MOF, indicating that Er-MOF/MoS2 has best catalytic activity which is consistent with the result of Tafel plots. To further inferred the reasons for the enhanced HER activity of Er-MOF/MoS2, EIS analyzes of Er-MOF, MoS2 and Er-MOF/MoS2 were performed at an overpotential of 234 mV. The corresponding Nyquistare are presented in Fig. 3h, the equivalent circuit was used to fit the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the electrolyte resistance (Rs). The semicircle diameter of Er-MOF/MoS2 is significantly smaller than that for Er-MOF and MoS2. As show in Table 1 The calculated Rct values followed the order: Er-MOF/MoS2 (2.3 Ω) < MoS2 (296.8 Ω) < Er-MOF (5668 Ω). The Rct values of Er-MOF/MoS2 is significantly reduced compared with Er-MOF and MoS2, indicating faster electron transfer of Er-MOF/MoS2 during the electrocatalysis process. This suggesting that in the process of synthesizing MoS2 based on Er-MOF, the effect of Er-MOF on MoS2 promotes the conductivity of the material and further affects its catalytic activity. The reason of high conductivity also can be demonstrated by the XPS and XRD results. As shown in the Fig. 3g, the stability of Er-MOF/MoS2 Composite catalysts can be judged by comparing the changes of polarization current density after a period of time at 200 mV overpotential. After 12 h of i-t-test, The current density of Er-MOF and MoS2 decreased to a certain extent (Figs. S3, S4). the current density of Er-MOF/MoS2 is basically stable indicating that it has good stability, which can be attributed to the stable structure of three-dimensional microporous structures."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a facile procedure was developed to fabricated Er-MOF/MoS2 by using Er-MOF as precursor and then compounding MoS2. Er-MOF/MoS2 exhibited the best water splitting electrocatalytic activities of as compared to Er-MOF and MoS₂. With only 234 mV overpotential, the current density can reach 10 mA cm−2, and Er-MOF/MoS2 also shows excellent long-term durability, highlighting its catalytic performance. The superior electrocatalytic activity can mainly be attributed to the following features: (1) uniform and well-dispersed heterostructure provide more active sites and high ECSA; (2) rapid charge transport of Er-MOF/MoS2 due to the high activity of MoS2 anchored onto Er-MOF; and (3) the synergistic effect of MoS2 and Er-MOF enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity of Er-MOF/MoS2."
