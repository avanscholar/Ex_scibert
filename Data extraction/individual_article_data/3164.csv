0,Introduction,"The hyperthermophilic bacteria have attracted increasing interest for potential biotechnological applications due to their many outstanding properties. They can produce hydrogen (H2), one of the renewable energy carriers for the future, with high yield from a wide range of carbohydrates, especially starch, hemicellulose or cellulose (Schroˇder et al., 1994; van Niel et al., 2002). Moreover, the very high growth temperatures between 70 and 110°C of hyperthermophiles make their H2 fermentation less sensitive to contaminations by H2 consumers. Although hyperthermophiles show a better resistance to high H2 partial pressures (van Niel et al., 2003), they are still under the influence of feedback inhibition from H2 build-up. The very high H2 partial pressure has an inhibitory effect on their H2 production by shifting metabolic pathway towards formation of more reduced by-products such as lactate, ethanol, acetone, butanol or alanine (Levin et al., 2004). Therefore, an efficient H2 removal step is required for maximizing the H2 yield. Gas sparging that reduces hydrogen partial pressure has been considered as an effective method to remove the H2 produced in the gas phase (Kausik Nath and Debabrata Das, 2004). In this study, the N2 sparging method for enhancing anaerobic H2 fermentation was applied on Thermotoga neapolitana. T. neapolitana, a strain of hyperthermophilic eubacteria belonging to the genus Thermotoga, was isolated from shallow marine sediment in a volcanic region near Lucrino, Bay of Naples, Italy (Belkin et al., 1986; Jannasch et al., 1988). It is an obligate anaerobe with an optimum growth temperature of 77°C but can tolerate low levels of oxygen quite readily in liquid cultures (Van Ooteghem et al., 2001, 2004). Since H2 partial pressure directly depends on the volume of the gas headspace or the liquid volume in the closed bioreactor, the effect of the gas headspace volume on the tolerance ability for H2 was first investigated. The effects of various substrate concentrations on the hydrogen production from glucose and xylose of this strain were then studied. Next, H2 fermentation using glucose or xylose under N2 gas sparging and non-sparging condition was investigated. Concentrations of H2 in the headspace of the culture vial and various other metabolites in the medium were measured to estimate the effect of N2 gas sparging on the H2 production of T. neapolitana."
1,Methods,
2,Microbial species and cultivation,"2.1 Microbial species and cultivation The hyperthermophilic bacterium T. neapolitana strain DSM 4359 was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Germany. The Thermotoga maritima basal (TMB) medium used for cultivation of the strain was optimized by the method of Jiang et al. (2006). Cells were routinely cultivated in batch mode using 120ml-serum bottles in a shaking oil bath at 150rpm with a 4% inoculum at 77°C and pH 7.5. Various gas headspace volumes and concentrations of glucose or xylose were used to optimize the growth and H2 production. The optimized conditions were then applied on studying H2 production under N2 gas sparging and non-sparging conditions. Twice of pure N2 gas was sparged immediately after the culture achieved the maximum H2 level in the headspace of the closed vials. The rubber lid of the serum bottle was not opened during sparging. The inlet of pure nitrogen flow sparged into the inside of the serum bottle through the needle connected to 0.2μm filter. Another needle is the outlet of the gas. Both of needles were inserted on the rubber lid of closed serum bottle. Each time of sparging was performed at the same flow rate for about 5min for an anaerobic atmosphere."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods H2 gas in the headspace was analyzed by using a gas chromatography system (GC, HP 5890 Series II, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2m stainless column packed with Carboxen 1000, 50/80 mesh (Supelco). The system temperatures of the injection port, oven, and detector were 120, 60, and 120°C, respectively with N2 as the carrier gas (55ml/min). Acetic acid and butyric acid were quantified by the same GC system with a capillary Hewlett Packard Carbowax 20M column (30m×0.5mm×1.33μm film thickness) and a flame ionization detector. The temperatures of the injection port, oven, and detector were 230, 100 and 250°C, respectively, with nitrogen as the carrier gas (12.5ml/min). The residual glucose concentration in the medium was determined by using a glucose oxidase technique with BMI glucose-E KIT (BMI Company, Korea). The xylose concentration was determined using phloroglucinol-based colorimetric method (Eberts et al., 1979)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Effect of ratio of the gas headspace volume and liquid volume on H2 production,"3.1 Effect of ratio of the gas headspace volume and liquid volume on H2 production The cells cultivated under sterile and non-sterile conditions showed the same growth and hydrogen production in all batch cultivations (data not shown). The bacterial populations after fermentations were observed under phase contrast microscope (Nikon, Japan) to consist of identical groups of rod-shaped cells enveloped in outer cell membranes. This indicates that a sterilization step is not necessary to the cultivation process of T. neapolitana because no contamination occurred in the conditions that favoured the growth of this bacterium. Therefore, the later investigations in our study were carried out under the non-autoclaved condition. Ratio of gas headspace volume and liquid volume has a clear effect on H2 production of T. neapolitana. In the closed 120ml-bottle, 40ml of liquid culture, thereby giving a gas headspace volume equal to 2/3 of the vessel volume, results in the best H2 gas production headspace (Fig. 1 ). When decreasing the gas headspace volume by increasing liquid volume, the H2 level in gas headspace volume increased even up to approximate 60% (v/v) but this increase in H2 level is insignificant because its total H2 production was not effective with lower produced H2 content. These results suggest that the optimum headspace volume for H2 production in T. neapolitana culture was approximately 2/3 of the vessel volume. This study is very significant to determine the most suitable ratio of liquid cultivation medium for the highest H2 fermentation in a closed bioreactor. The increase in liquid volume from 50 to 80ml gave approximate values of cell density (Fig. 1). This proves the growth of the bacterium increased with increase in liquid volume but their produced H2 content did not. Therefore, H2 production of the bacterium in these cases was inhibited by very high H2 levels in decreased gas headspace volumes."
6,Effect of substrate concentration on H2 production,"3.2 Effect of substrate concentration on H2 production The important role of initial substrate concentration in the H2 production of anaerobic microbial systems has been reported. According to in some previous studies, the initial glucose concentration may affect the dissolubility of H2 in the liquid medium and the productivity of H2 (Yao-ting et al., 2004; Majizat et al., 1997). In our study, the glucose concentration of 7g/l maximized the cell growth and H2 production. The maximum H2 accumulation at the glucose concentration was consistently 41.5% (v/v). A different maximum H2 level in this strain was reported to be about 20–30% (v/v gas headspace) under microaerophilic process (Van Ooteghem et al., 2001, 2004). Therefore, the level of oxygen in cultivation medium can affect the ability to tolerate hydrogen partial pressure of the bacterium. Under anaerobic condition, the bacterium show higher toleration of H2 partial pressure than under micro-anaerobic condition. In case of xylose as substrate, the optimal substrate concentration for growth and H2 production of T. neapolitana was 4g/l. The maximum H2 accumulation on xylose was 31.3% (v/v) (Fig. 2 ). Fermentative H2 production from hexose with this bacterial strain has been well reported but no literature is known regarding its H2 production from pentose (e.g., xylose). H2 production and the growth interrelate closely in T. neapolitana. As depicted in Fig. 3 , the optimal glucose and xylose concentrations for growth which were 7 and 4g/l, respectively, gave the highest H2 production. The substrate utilization of this bacterium reaches 97% and 92% for glucose and xylose, respectively. Increasing the substrate concentration of two sugars above their optimal values led two different changing tendencies of bacterial growth. In case of glucose, the growth of the bacterium increases and appears to reach a certain plateau following to increase of initial glucose concentration. While the growth of bacterium on xylose decreased when the initial xylose concentration was over the optimal value. Strictly anaerobic bacteria synthesize H2 from ferredoxin which indicates that the high H2 yield was associated with the formation of acetate and butyrate (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). In our study, acetate and butyrate were presented as the major metabolites of H2 fermentation from glucose or xylose in T. neapolitana (Fig. 3). One interesting thing here is that butyrate formation is quite more dominant than acetate formation with xylose as carbon source. Up to now, there has been not much research on H2 fermentation of T. neapolitana. Van Ooteghem et al. reported the results with only data of gas content investigation (Van Ooteghem et al., 2001, 2004). Another previous report on H2 production by T. neapolitana of Eriksen et al. (2008) indicated that T. neapolitana produced H2 with the yield of 2.4±0.3mol H2 mol−1 glucose and acetic and lactic acid were by-products in the fermentative medium. The same as the cases of different reduced products such as alcohols, the lactic acid production pathway is believed not to be accompanied with H2 synthesis and reduces H2 production. The lactic acid production could explain for the low H2 yield obtained from their research. In our research, H2 production with higher yield of 3.24±0.14mol H2 mol−1 glucose and 2.20±0.13mol H2 mol−1 xylose were obtained associated with the production of mixture of acetic and butyric acids. During experimental process, we noticed that when T. neapolitana the H2 production rate began suddenly decrease, it was the time the H2 content in the headspace achieved the maximum level and made a inhibitory effect on continuous H2 synthesis. This was the important moment to adjust the H2 production for a high H2 yield by gas sparging. The most effective N2 sparging should be carried out before this time when the H2 production inhibition caused by high hydrogen partial pressure occurred. The N2 sparging done after this time also gave an increase in H2 production but was less effective (data not shown). Metabolic pathways that produced reduced products appear to more effectively react when the H2 synthesis was depressed. Therefore, gas sparging is also considered to be an effective method to direct the metabolic pathway for an high yielded- H2 production."
7,Increasing H2 production using N2 sparging method,"3.3 Increasing H2 production using N2 sparging method N2 sparging was carried out using the 120ml-bottle for enhancing H2 production of the bacterium when the H2 content in the gas headspace reached its maximum value inhibiting the further H2 generation. The purposes of the N2 sparging were to renew the atmosphere in the gas headspace by removing the H2 and CO2 produced from the fermentation and to lower the partial pressure of H2 and CO2 and thereby improve H2 production. With H2 fermentation from glucose, two times of N2 sparging were applied after 40 and 70h for the first and second sparging, respectively. The maximum H2 contents after these N2 sparging are of different levels, 36–40%. Only one time of N2 sparging was applied on H2 production using xylose due to the lower maximum H2 content, 24–31% (Fig. 4 ). These decreases may have been due to cell degradation resulting from late stationary phase to death phase that reduced the viable cell population for H2 production. Results from Table 1 indicate the efficiency of N2 sparging in releasing the H2 production from the inhibitory effect created by the high H2 partial pressure. The production levels of H2, acetate and butyrate from the fermentation with N2 sparging were much higher than those from the non-sparged fermentation for H2 production from both glucose and xylose. The H2 yield with N2 sparging on glucose was 3.24mol H2/mol glucose. It was almost two-fold greater than that with non-sparging (1.82mol H2/mol glucose). The H2 yield with N2 sparging was increased by 78%. In case of xylose, the H2 yield with N2 sparging was increased by 56% compared with non-sparging, from (1.41mol H2/mol xylose to 2.20mol H2/mol xylose. N2 sparging method for enhancing H2 fermentation in our study is simple and economical application. This method does not continuously use the N2 flow but it is applied to remove produced H2 only when H2 content in gas headspace of closed bioreactor reaches the inhibitory level of H2 fermentation. Our N2 sparging method not only saves on N2 gas but also makes further H2 obtainment easy. In previous research on improving H2 production, continuous gas sparging was performed with mixed microflora. The highest previously reported increase in H2 yield by N2 sparging was 68% by Mizuno et al. (2000). Hussy et al. (2003) described an increase in H2 yield by N2 sparging of only 22% from 1.53mol H2/mol hexose to 1.87mol H2/mol hexose."
8,Conclusion,"This study confirmed the efficiency of N2 sparging in increasing H2 fermentation in a limited-volume, cultivation system. The proposed sparging method is simple and economical because it is carried out in batch mode at 40 and 70h after cultivation when the bacterium achieves the maximum H2 level in the gas headspace. N2 sparging increased the H2 yields by 56% and 78% on the pentose and hexose, respectively, compared with non-sparging fermentations. In comparison with previous studies on N2 sparging, the present study is superior in both enhancement of H2 production and ease of application because our N2 sparging method was simple, economical, and carried out intermittently."
