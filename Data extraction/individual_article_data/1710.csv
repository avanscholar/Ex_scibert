0,Introduction,"Development of a clean and renewable energy source has become an urgent need in modern times because of the depletion of fossil fuel, and also the possible correlation between global climate change and its consumption (Jo et al., 2008). Hydrogen (H2), with the highest energy density and generating only water after combustion, is considered as one of the most promising alternatives (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Fang et al., 2006). Besides its cleanliness, in terms of no greenhouse gas (GHG) production during combustion, hydrogen has many benefits, such as being used as the fuel for a conventional fuel cell, where electricity can be produced without combustion. Among hydrogen production processes, fermentative hydrogen production (FHP) is an attractive route since a variety of carbon sources can be used as the feedstock, such as starch (Liu and Shen, 2004), cellulose (Lay, 2001), sucrose (Chen et al., 2001), glucose (Lee et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Whang et al., 2011), xylose (Zhu and Yang, 2004), and mixture of biomass and organic wastes (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Hawkes et al., 2008; Juang et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2012). It is widely known that various volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and/or alcohols are produced through dark fermentative hydrogen production. The theoretical H2 yield is 4mol H2/mol glucose when acetate is the sole product while a maximum yield of 2mol H2/mol glucose was obtained when butyrate as the end product. The maximum yield of 12mol H2/mol glucose which should be achieved from the complete conversion of glucose to H2 and CO2 has never been attained in known biological system until now (Fang et al., 2006). The low conversion yield might presumably due to the natural consequence that microorganism tend to produce cell biomass evolutionarily instead of hydrogen, and to the competing reactions such as hydrogen consumption or division to other products (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). In practice, H2 yield is related to the metabolic pathways and end-products, like when butyrate-to-acetate ratio (B/A ratio) and lactate yield have been proved to be related to H2 production. Therefore, it appears that there are some critical metabolic activities in H2 fermentation which may be ignored in the currently proposed metabolic reactions and equations (Cai et al., 2011) and the potential of FHP anaerobes has not totally explored and their metabolic network requires to be understood. Possible fermentation pathways of H2 production by Clostridium sp. utilizing glucose have been reported in several researches (Sridhar and Eiteman, 2001; Zhu and Yang, 2004; Cai et al., 2010), it seems that Clostridium sp. share similar pathways. Clostridium tyrobutyricum is one of saccharolytic clostridia which is wildly incubated in butyric acid production (Zhu et al., 2002; Wu and Yang, 2003) and H2 fermentation (Jo et al., 2008; Whang et al., 2011) since it has many advantages over other species, including simple medium for cell growth and relatively high product purity and yield (Michel-Savin et al., 1990). However, the impact of incubation factors such as hydraulic retention time (HRT) or initial substrate concentration on metabolic flux distribution in the biological H2 fermentative system applying C. tyrobutyricum is still not well-known. The quantification of the pathway fluxes becomes important for both bioreactor operation and metabolic engineering in order to enhance H2 production. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has been considered as a useful methodology to calculate intracellular fluxes from extracellular fluxes, and would be helpful for the comprehension of flux regulation in the H2 fermentation (Manish et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2011). In this study, the metabolic network model for the fermentative hydrogen production of C. tyrobutyricum was developed. The MFA methodology was employed to illustrate the possible mechanism and flux distribution during glucose and lactate/acetate metabolism of C. tyrobutyricum, and to study the effect of HRT and initial substrate concentration on the intracellular fluxes under a constant temperature and pH."
1,Methods,
2,Bioreactor operation,"2.1 Bioreactor operation Two continuous stirred tank reactor-type (CSTR) bioreactors, fed with glucose (GA) and lactate/acetate (LA) respectively, were conducted in the present study. For the GA bioreactor, an isolated pure culture of C. tyrobutyricum FYa102 from previous studies (Li et al., 2010; Whang et al., 2011) was applied as seeding sludge, and 12,000mg/L of glucose, 1400mg/L of ammonium chloride, and 360mg/L of peptone were fed as a substrate. The seeding microorganism for LA bioreactor was obtained from a lab-scale continuous flow bioreactor fed with wasted residue from a bio-ethanol fermentation process (Juang et al., 2011) and C. tyrobutyricum was considered the major hydrogen-producing species in LA bioreactor (Wu et al., 2012). The predetermined concentration of lactate and acetate were served with a ratio of 10–3 as a substrate, and ammonium chloride and peptone were also added. The total volume of both bioreactors was 4L and the working volume was 2L. The feedstock solutions were stored at 4°C and continuously fed into the bioreactors using a peristaltic pump. Each liter of the influent feed was supplemented with the following chemicals (in mg): resazurin, 0.175; CaCl2·6H2O, 32.32; MgCl2·6H2O, 232.26; KCl, 167.81; MnCl2·4H2O, 63.87; CoCl2·6H2O, 3.87; H3BO3, 0.74; CuCl·2H2O, 0.35; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.33; ZnCl2, 0.27; FeCl2·4H2O, 10.62; sodium thioglycolate, 217.35; KH2PO4, 119 (Liu et al., 2010; Whang et al., 2011). The pH in both bioreactors was controlled at 6.0±0.1 with a pH controller by the addition of 5% H3PO4 and 10% NaOH throughout the experiments. The amount of biogases produced from both bioreactors was measured with a wet-gas flow meter (Shinagawa W-NK-0.5B, Tokyo, Japan)."
3,Sample preparation and analysis,"2.2 Sample preparation and analysis Biogases collected from the bioreactors and batches were analyzed by gas chromatograph (China GC 8900, Taipei, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 2m stainless column packed with Hayesep Q (60/80mesh) was installed in the oven and the operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were set at 90, 60 and 60°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15mL/min. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, and sugars were determined using high pressured liquid chromatograph (Hitachi D2000 system, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an ICSep COREGEL-87H3 column (7.8mm×300mm) in a 42°C oven and an RI Range 16× detector. The eluent used was 0.008N sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The pH, ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N), organic nitrogen, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to the standard methods (APHA, 1998)."
4,MFA and CellNetAnalyzer,"2.3 MFA and CellNetAnalyzer MFA is a modeling tool based on stoichiometric reactions analysis and mass balances (Cai et al., 2011). It can provide information about the intracellular metabolism conversion and metabolites exchange with extracellular environment despite the overwhelming complexity of cellular responses. The incoming fluxes of each metabolites node will balance the outgoing fluxes under the assumption of constructed metabolic network and pseudo-steady state (Cai et al., 2011). The CellNetAnalyzer, a software package of the MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.) for metabolic networks as well as signaling and regulation networks analysis, was used to estimate and predict the stoichiometry of different products during H2 fermentation."
5,Metabolic network of C. tyrobutyricum,"2.4 Metabolic network of C. tyrobutyricum The glucose and lactate/acetate metabolic fluxes network in H2 production developed for MFA was evaluated and modified from regular biochemical pathways of glucose metabolism reported for Clostridium species (Sridhar and Eiteman, 2001; Cai et al., 2010). The network of C. tyrobutyricum is presented in Fig. 1 , and the abbreviation of the metabolites and related reactions are summarized in Appendix A and B, respectively. The network was constructed using 21 reactions (J 1–J 20, and biomass synthesis) and 16 intracellular metabolites for the GA bioreactor, including glucose utilization (J 1) and production of lactate, formate, acetate, butyrate, ethanol, H2 and CO2 (J 6, J 7, J 8, J 9, J 10, J 11, J 13). For the LA bioreactor, there were 18 reactions (J −2–J −6, J 8, J −9, J 10, J 12–J 20, and biomass synthesis) and 16 intracellular metabolites in the network, since glucose, ethanol and formate were not detected during experiments. The model construction and MFA analysis were performed using the CellNetAnalyzer, and the steady state specific uptake/production/growth rate (mmol/gVSS/h) at different HRTs were used as constraints in the model. Mass balance for carbon was calculated to examine the reliability of output data and all the flux distribution were normalized by the basis of glucose or lactate/acetate uptake rate and expressed as percentage."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Node analysis of GA bioreactor,"3.1 Node analysis of GA bioreactor For the GA bioreactor, the metabolic flux distribution under the HRT between 2 and 18h are shown in Fig. 2 . The errors of carbon mass balance of each run were less than 5%. In general, HRT presented a significant impact on H2 production. H2 production became unfavorable when HRT approached to 4h which was the doubling time of C. tyrobutyricum, as found in batch experiments. In order to further understand the detailed flux distribution, node analysis was applied. Table 1 and Fig. 2 summarize the results of node analysis for the MFA of C. tyrobutyricum fed with glucose. The first hinge of this network was the intermediate metabolite G6P, the flux divided into two pathways at this node, recognized as the Embden–Mayerhof–Paranas (EMP) pathway (J 2) and the Pentose Phosphate (PP) pathway (J 14). The flux ratio of J 2/J 14 ranged from 15 to 100 when HRT >4h to below 10 when HRT <4h, suggesting that lower HRT condition was suitable for PP pathway. However, EMP pathway was the main route for C. tyrobutyricum during glucose fermentation. At the PEP node, the fraction of flux mostly was toward to pyruvate (J 5) instead of OAA (J 12) under every HRT conditions, with only a slightly increase of OAA distribution to 0.17% when HRT decreased to 2h. In glucose metabolism network, pyruvate was another important intermediate. Pyruvate could be converted either to lactate (J 6) or acetyl-CoA, but the production of acetyl-CoA could either co-generate formate (J 7) or reduced ferredoxin and CO2 (J 8). Among the three routes, J 8 was a critical route responsible for production of hydrogen from reduced ferredoxin through hydrogenase. Accordingly, it would be unfavorable to H2 production if the flux distributed to the production of lactate (J 6) or formate (J 7). The ratio of J 8/(J 6 + J 7) decreased from 5.5 to approximately 0.1 with a decreased HRT, indicating considerable amount of flux distributed into the routes which were unfavorable to H2 production at lower HRT conditions especially lower than 4h. The highest flux of lactate distribution was attained at HRT of 4h, which was closed to the doubling time of C. tyrobutyricum (Whang et al., 2011). The formation of lactate was regulated by two enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and inducible NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenase (iLDH). LDH converts pyruvate to lactate while iLDH reverses the reaction, and increase or decrease of their activity is attributed to the ratio of NADH/NAD+ and pH (Wu and Yang, 2003). In addition, microbial growth rate may also affect the activities of LDH and iLDH. Formate production was at a minimum level of 5.2% at HRT of 4h, while the maximum flux for formate of 37.2% appeared at HRT of 2h. In general, a lower HRT promoted a higher formate flux distribution which generated acetyl-CoA without generating reduced ferredoxin, resulting in the ratio of J 8/J 7 lower than at HRT <4h. At the node of acetyl-CoA, three major external metabolites of glucose fermentation were produced, including acetate, butyrate and ethanol. Ethanol distribution varied between 23% and 59%, except for a minimum value of 1.6% occurred at HRT of 18h, indicating a lower NADH2 consumption. The ratio of butyrate to acetate (B/A, J 10/J 9) has been considered as an important indicator for H2 production (Liu et al., 2010). In this study, the ratio of J 10/J 9 was higher than 1 at HRT >4h, and this ratio decreased to lower than 1 when HRT was lower than 4h."
8,MFA of LA bioreactor,"3.2 MFA of LA bioreactor Lactate utilization by Clostridium sp. has been studied when carbohydrates were present (Jo et al., 2008; Juang et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2012), but limited information was available for using lactate as a sole energy source during batch experiments. Matsumoto and Nishimura (2007) isolated three Clostridium species from slurry solution, and concluded that these species can produce hydrogen from acetate and lactate. The presence of acetate was found to be necessary during lactate fermentation, but the role of acetate, however, was still unclear. Diez-Gonzalez et al. (1995) suggested that acetate may serve as an electron acceptor during lactate utilization and acetate was not the limiting substrate (Woolford, 1984). The metabolic flux distribution of C. tyrobutyricum in LA bioreactor under different HRT and lactate/acetate concentration is summarized in Fig. 3 . The flux was presented in the order of volumetric loading rate (VLR), ranging from 21.8 to 83.5kg-COD/m3/day. The maximum distribution of H2 production (J 13) was 47% at VLR of 27.8kg-COD/m3/day, which was under the HRT of 18h and lactate/acetate concentration of 15,000/4500mg/L. Under the same condition, the highest ratio for lactate/acetate utilization was found to be 2.78, indicating the lowest acetate consumption. A lower acetate consumption indicated a lower ATP requirement for activation energy from acetate to acetyl-CoA, and thus, resulted in a higher NADH production during conversion of lactate to pyruvate. This can be confirmed by a lowest flux distribution of 4.72% from FdH2 to NADH and a maximum flux distribution for H2 production (47%). The flux distribution for butyrate (J 10) at different HRT and substrate concentration was similar ranging from 38.4% to 43.3%, since butyrate was the major end product of lactate and acetate fermentation (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995). In the pathway of lactate utilization, butyrate production was the only ATP generation step and the generated ATP was further utilized for activation of acetate. Table 2 summarizes the results of node analysis for the MFA of C. tyrobutyricum fed with lactate/acetate. At the node of pyruvate, more than 60% of the fraction flux was toward to Acetyl-CoA with co-generation of reduced ferredoxin and CO2 (J 8). About 20% to 35% of flux distributed back to PEP (J −5) and further produced materials for biomass synthesis via gluconeogenesis pathway. Two fluxes, including pyruvate (J 8) and acetate (J −9), flowed into the acetyl-CoA node and butyrate (J 10) was formed as the end-product. The highest ratio of J 8–J −9 was found to be 1.95, at which lowest acetate was consumed with a higher production of reduced ferredoxin, resulting in a highest hydrogen production flux."
9,Effect of metabolites on H2 production under different HRTs,"3.3 Effect of metabolites on H2 production under different HRTs In Fig. 2, the maximum flux distribution of C. tyrobutyricum fed with glucose for H2 production was found to be 161.4% at HRT of 18h. The H2 production flux decreased with a decreased HRT from 18 to 4h, and the production flux increased to 94.2% at HRT of 2h. The lowest flux for ethanol production was also found at HRT of 18h with a value of 3.2%. It is possible that a lower ethanol production reserves more NADH for other flux since NADH is required for ethanol formation. These reserved NADH can be used for butyrate production (J 10) or ferredoxin reduction (J 20), and thus promotes H2 production. Additionally, an increased butyrate production may increase the ATP formation which can be used for activation of acetate, and thus, promoted the lactate utilization (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995). This was also confirmed by the 0% lactate flux observed at HRT of 18h. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that lactate accumulation in lactate/acetate-fed bioreactors can be attributed to a relatively slow growth of Clostridium sp. on lactate and acetate compared with on glucose (Diez-Gonzalez et al., 1995; Jo et al., 2008; Whang et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a negative correlation between lactate flux and H2 production in glucose metabolism under different HRTs is illustrated in Fig. 4 A and this relationship agreed with the statement that lactate production reduces H2 production due presumably to the competition of NADH (Heyndrickx et al., 1990; Lee et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). The B/A ratio has been considered as an indicator in evaluating H2 production, with a higher B/A ratio corresponding to a higher H2 yield (Lee and Rittmann, 2009; Liu et al., 2010). In our study, the H2 production flux also showed a positive correlation with the ratio of butyrate flux to acetate flux (J 10/J 9) as indicated in Fig. 4B. Following the metabolism of glucose for fermentative hydrogen production, theoretically, 4 or 2mol of hydrogen are produced by converting 1mol of glucose to 2mol of acetate or 1mol of butyrate, respectively. In the case, a decrease in the B/A ratio tended to decrease hydrogen production, and therefore, the stoichiometry apparently disagreed with the correlation found in this study. Possible explanations for the above disagreement have been discussed in previous study (Cheng et al., 2012) including the metabolism of lactate and acetate for butyrate and hydrogen production. This mechanism often took place in the systems fed with organic wastes (Cavinato et al., 2011; Juang et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2012), but in this study, it seemed that this mechanism may also occur in the system fed with glucose as the sole substrate."
10,Metabolic flux analysis on biological H2 production,"3.4 Metabolic flux analysis on biological H2 production In order to achieve a higher H2 production yield, optimization of cellular metabolic pathways is necessary and this requires an extensive analysis and understanding of metabolic pathways and their regulation in the H2-producing organisms (Oh et al., 2008). Manish et al. (2007) were the pioneers applying MFA to biological hydrogen production with Escherichia coli and indicated that the mutant strain without ldh may increase hydrogen production. Based on a metabolic-pathway model for Citrobacter amalonaticus Y19, Oh et al. (2008) suggested that a hydrogen yield of 8.7mol/mol glucose can be possible if glucose metabolism was directed to the PP pathway and NAD(P)-linked hydrogenase was used to produce hydrogen. Cai et al. (2010) developed a metabolic network model of Clostridium butyricum W5 and reported that pH condition was a significant factor on hydrogen yield than initial glucose concentration according to MFA. In the following studies, by blocking the butyrate formation pathway, Cai et al. (2011) demonstrated a decreased hydrogen yield accompanied with an increased yield of ethanol using the hbd-deficient strain of W5. Furthermore, the aad-deficient mutant of W5, by inactivating the ethanol formation pathway, attained an enhanced lactate production but a decreased hydrogen generation (Cai et al., 2013). By applying MFA on results obtained from fed-batch experiments, Jiang et al. (2013) indicated that pH condition was critical to H2 production yield, with a maximum production of 3.9mol-H2/mol-glucose by a butyrate over-producing C. tyrobutyricum mutant. To date, MFA has been applied for biological hydrogen production mostly using results obtained from batch or fed-batch experiments. The current study, for the first time, applied MFA for biological hydrogen production using experimental results obtained from continuous flow bioreactors. Furthermore, this study evaluated the impacts of HRTs or dilution rates on biological hydrogen production from two different substrates, glucose or lactate/acetate. This work provided helpful information on optimization of operational parameters and development of molecular and metabolic engineering to improve yield and productivity of biological H2 production."
11,Conclusion,"The metabolic fluxes network of C. tyrobutyricum in H2 production from glucose and lactate/acetate fermentation was evaluated in this study. MFA results indicate that HRT presents a significant impact on the metabolic flux of hydrogen production from glucose. At HRT between 4 and 18h, increase of HRT increased hydrogen production but decreased lactate production, while at HRT below 4h decrease of HRT increased hydrogen production but decreased lactate production. The flux for lactate, butyrate and acetate seemed to affect H2 production, due presumably to their impacts on the balance of NADH, ferredoxin and ATP."
