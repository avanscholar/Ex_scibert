0,Introduction,"The increase in prices of petroleum based fuels, future depletion of worldwide petroleum reserves and environmental polices to reduce CO2 emissions have stimulated research into the development of biotechnology to produce clean energy from renewable resources [1]. Hydrogen is one of the answers to foreseeable energy crisis and environmental pollution. It is preferred to biogas or methane because H2 is not chemically bound to carbon, and therefore, burning does not contribute to greenhouse gases or acid rain [2]. Hydrogen is produced mainly from natural gas, a finite resource, through steam reforming, a process that generates large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is a principal cause of global warming. Therefore, it is imperative that to consolidate the benefits of using H2 as a fuel or energy carrier, alternative but cleaner processes that rely on renewable feedstock must be developed. Hydrogen production plays a very important role in the development of H2 economy. Thus, the innovation of technologies leading to safe, sustainable, economically feasible H2 production is in urgent demand. Hydrogen can be produced by anaerobic bacteria through dark fermentation. Anaerobic bacteria capable of H2 production includes species of Enterobacter [3], Bacillus [4], Clostridium [5,6] and Thermotoga [7,8]. Hydrogen production through dark or photofermentative conversion of organic substrates is of great interest due to its dual function of waste reduction and clean energy production, thereby acting as a promising option for biohydrogen production [9–11]. Fermentative H2 production can use various renewable biomass and numerous agriculture, municipal and food processing waste and wastewater sources [12–27]. Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is one of the most important fruit trees growing in the Arabian world and some neighboring counties and represents a good cash crop for many farmers. The date palm starts to produce fruits at an average age of 5 years, and continues production with an average yield of 400–600 kg/tree/year for up to 60 years [28]. The date palm is considered a symbol of life in the desert, because it tolerates high temperatures, drought and salinity more than many other fruit crop plant species [29]. It is one of the oldest trees from which man has derived benefit, and it has been cultivated since ancient times. It the only indigenous wild desert plant definitely domesticated in its native harsh environments appears to be the date palm [30]. Many insects are known to attack date palm fruits and trees [29]. Mycotoxigenic fungi, particularly aflatoxigenic Aspergilli, have been associated with dates and date products [31–35]. The rot of dates is due to increased infestation of pests and diseases, improper transporting, handling, and lack of cold stores, lack of marketing and export. By giving farmers a way to profit from dates that are starting to rot, they help to minimize the risk. Farmers will be happy to sell their rotten dates instead of throwing them away. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the H2 production from rotten fruits of date palm (P. dactylifera L.). The study also presents H2 production by sequential three stages fermentation by Escherichia coli EGY, Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and Rhodobacter capsulatus DSM 1710."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Isolation, purification and phenotypic identification of E. coli","2.1 Isolation, purification and phenotypic identification of E. coli E. coli EGY was recovered from Nile River water by Most Probable Number (MPN) techniques using lactose broth medium [36]. The positive tubes were confirmed on Eosin Methylene Blue Agar. Colonies were further characterized as E. coli by subculture on MacConkey medium. Bacteriological characteristics (Gram stain, Ryu's test, colony color, oxidase reaction, arginine dihydroxylase activity, nitrate reduction, utilization of carbohydrates, Levan formation, catalase test, gelatin hydrolysis, starch hydrolysis, esculin hydrolyzation and Tween 20) of the isolate were examined by using the methods described in Bergey's Manual [37]."
3,DNA extraction and amplification of 16S rRNA gene,"2.2 DNA extraction and amplification of 16S rRNA gene DNA was extracted from bacterial cultures using an SDS/CTAB lysis and phenol/chloroform extraction method [38]. The 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified using primer pairs 16S-F 10430 = AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG and16S-R10430 = AAGGAGGTGATTCCAGCC were used to amplify a near-full length, approximately 1500 bp fragment of 16S rDNA from the isolate. Amplification of 16S rRNA fragments from genomic DNA was carried out in a total reaction volume of 100 μL containing: 5 μL of bacteria DNA as template, 5 μL of each forward and reverse primer (10 μM), 50 μL of Go TagR DNA Polymerase Green Master Mix, 2x Kit (Promega, USA) and 35 μL of nuclease-free water. The reaction was performed using Eppendorf Ag 22331 Authorized Thermal Cycler (Hamburg, Germany) at Laboratory of Plant Molecular Biology, Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan. The reaction conditions were: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 180 s, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 70 s, annealing at 56 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 130 s. A final extension was conducted at 72 °C for 370 s. PCR products were purified (MonoFas DNA Purification Kit I, GL Sciences, Inc., Japan) and quantified photometrically (UV mini-1240 Shimadzu). Purified PCR products were cycle sequenced in both directions with the same forward primer and reverse primer using Applied Biosystems 3730X-1 DNA Analyzer (Fast Smack Inc. Division DNA synthesis, Kanagawa, Japan). The sequence reads were edited and assembled using BioEdit version 7.0.4 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and clustal W version 1.83 (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html). BLAST searches were done using the NCBI server at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi. Phylogenetic trees derived from 16S rRNA gene sequence were conducted in the context of 16S rRNA gene sequences from eight different standard bacterial strains obtained from GenBank: E. coli (AB548575), E. coli (AB548582), E. coli (HQ694183), E. coli CPBE30 (HQ259943), E. coli (AB548578), E. coli (AB548581), E. coli (FR715025) and Bacillus cereus (AY138277)."

Pre-culture medium was nutrient broth containing (g L−1): beef extract, 5; peptone, 5; NaCl, 3. Cells were shaken aerobically overnight (100 rpm) at 30 °C and used for subsequent H2 production experiments. C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was a generous gift from Prof Dr. George Bennett, Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. Cells were grown anaerobically on glucose (1 g L−1) in a defined medium (pH = 6.2) containing (g L−1): NH4Cl, 0.2; KH2PO4, 1.8; K2HPO4, 2.40; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1; FeCl3, 0.02; CaCl2, 0.01; Na2BO7·H2O, 0.011; ZnCl2, 0.015; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01; CuCl2·2H2O, 0.015; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.01 [6]. Cells used to inoculate the fermentor were harvested during late-log growth based on optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ca. 0.2. R. capsulatus DSM 1710 was purchased from DSMZ, GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany. Cells were anaerobically cultivated in 500-mL screw medium glass bottles full of medium at 32 °C under light condition. The illumination was provided by 100 W tungsten lamp adjusted to provide a uniform light intensity of 150–200 W/m2 at the surface of the bottle. To maintain anaerobic conditions, the medium was bubbled with N2 gas (99%) for 30 min before inoculation. The composition of the medium was as follows: Yeast extract, 0.3 g; Na2-succinate, 1 g; (NH4)-acetate, 0.5 g; Ferric citrate, 0.005 g; K2HPO4, 0.5 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 g; NaCl, 0.4 g; NH4Cl, 0.4 g; CaCl4·H2O, 0.05 g; Vitamin B12 Solution (10 mg in 100 mL H2O), 0.4 mL, Trace element solution SL-6, 1 mL and distilled water 1050. The pH was adjusted to 6.8. The medium was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. Sterile syringes were used to inoculate and remove samples."

Four substrate concentrations 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 g L−1 of sucrose were supplemented to fermentor as rotten date fruits. The fermentative H2 production experiments were conducted in 2 L MultiGen fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co. Inc, Edison, N.J., USA) with a working volume of 1950 mL. 2.5.1 First stage: installing and maintenance of anaerobic conditions by E. coli EGY 1700 mL of homogenized rotten dates in distilled water was added to the fermentor and supplemented per liter of the medium with glucose, 1 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.3 g and FeSO4·7H2O, 50 mg. Prior to inoculation, the pH of the medium was adjusted 7.3 by 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl. After autoclaving, 150 mL of E. coli cells pre-grown in nutrient broth (OD600 = 0.2) was inoculated into the fermentor. No flashing with nitrogen or argon was conducted. Fermentation temperature was controlled at 30 °C with stirring at 100 rpm. The fermentor was set in dark and the evolved H2 was collected and measured by displacement of 2 M NaOH which was used to absorb CO2 [39]. 2.5.2 Second stage: dark fermentation using C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 After 12 h (from the start time) at which H2 evolution by E. coli completely ceased, 50 mL of precultured broth (106 cell mL−1) of obligate anaerobic C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was injected into the fermentor. Fermentation temperature was controlled at 30 °C with stirring at 100 rpm. The fermentor was set in dark and the evolved H2 was collected and measured by displacement of 2 M NaOH. 2.5.3 Third stage: photofermentation using R. capsulatus DSM 1710 After finishing the H2 evolution by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, the pH was adjusted to 7 by 2 M NaOH. Aliquots, 195 μL of 1 M Fe-Citrate, and 312 μL of 1 M Na2MoO4·2H2O, were injected to the fermentor to reach a final concentration of 0.1 mM and 0.16 mM respectively [12]. Subsequently, 50 mL of precultured broth (107 cell mL−1) of R. capsulatus DSM 1710 was injected to the closed fermentor. No flashing with nitrogen or argon gases was conducted. The fermentor was maintained at 30 °C in light conditions with stirring at 100 rpm. The illumination was provided by 100 W tungsten lamp adjusted to provide a uniform light intensity of 150–200 W/m2 at the surface of the fermentor. The evolved H2 was collected and measured by displacement of 2 M NaOH. All gas volumes are reported at 1 atm and 25 °C. The evolved H2 gas was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Thermo Scientific TRACE GC Ultra) equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) and a Stainless steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A (80/100 mesh) 2 m × 1/8 inch × 2.1 mm and HayeSepQ (80/100 mesh) 4 m × 1/8 inch × 2.1 mm. The temperature at the column was initially 50 °C and was increased to 200 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min."

The composition of the fermentation medium was as follows (g L−1): sucrose, (2.5, 5, 10 or 20); glucose, 1; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.3; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.05; NH4Cl, 0.2; KH2PO4, 1.8; K2HPO4, 2.40; CaCl2, 0.01; Na2BO7·H2O, 0.011; ZnCl2, 0.015; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01; CuCl2·2H2O, 0.015; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.01."
8,Analytical assessments,"2.7 Analytical assessments Protein concentration was determined by CBB G-250 dye binding method described by Bradford [40] using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard protein. Total lipids were determined colorimetrically using kits of DIAMOND Diagnostics, Egypt. Sucrose was determined by enzymatic hydrolysis by sucrose and the resulted reducing sugars were determined by Nelson reagent [41]. The moisture content was determined by the method described by Shukur [42]. All minerals were analyzed in the ash of the rotten date palm fruits. Rotten fruit samples (1 g) were digested in nitric–perchloric acid mixture (5:3) and further analyzed for their mineral content. Sodium and Potassium were determined by flame photometer method [43]. Calcium and magnesium were assayed by the versene titration method [44]. Phosphorus was determined calorimetrically [45].

9,Results,
10,"Isolation, characterization and H2 production tests of E. coli","3.1 Isolation, characterization and H2 production tests of E. coli Bacterial isolate recovered from Nile river water in Upper Egypt was identified on the bases of phenotypic characteristics (Supplementary Table 1). Bacterial isolate was chosen for further identification using phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence of 800 base pairs of the isolate had a sequence with 99% similarity to E. coli (HQ259943). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from multiple sequences alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Supplementary Fig. 1). Bacterial isolate was tested for their capability to produce H2 (Fig. 1 ) as described by Penfold et al. [39] from glucose. The effect of the substrate concentration on biohydrogen production by E. coli from glucose was investigated and the highest H2 yield (0.7 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) was obtained with the 2.5 g L−1 glucose concentration (Fig. 1). The tested isolate could not produce H2 from non-hydrolyzed date palm fruits (Fig. 1). Hydrogen production by E. coli from acid hydrolyzed rotten dates was also investigated (Fig. 1). Acid hydrolysis was conducted using 3 M HCl at 120 °C for 20 min and later neutralized to pH 7.3 by 2 M NaOH and used as a substrate for H2 production by E. coli EGY. The isolate produced H2 gas from acid hydrolyzed rotten dates homogenate in an efficiency of 0.6 mol H2 mol−1 glucose equivalents of reducing sugars of acid hydrolyzed dates. Such H2 yield (0.6 mol H2 mol−1 glucose equivalents) represented highest H2 yield that was obtained with the 2.5 g L−1 reducing sugar concentration of acid hydrolyzed dates."
11,"Hydrogen production by sequential three stages fermentation by E. coli EGY, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and R. capsulatus DSM 1710","3.2 Hydrogen production by sequential three stages fermentation by E. coli EGY, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and R. capsulatus DSM 1710 Rotten dates used in this study were homogenized and analyzed (Table 1 ). Sucrose represented the major content (42%) of fresh rotten date palm fruits while soluble proteins represented only 2% of the total fresh mass of the rotten date palm fruits. No detectable reducing sugars were observed in the rotten date palm fruits. 3.2.1 First stage: maintenance strict anaerobic conditions by E. coli EGY A facultative anaerobe, E. coli EGY was applied to maintenance strict anaerobic conditions for C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 to grow and for subsequent H2 production from rotten dates homogenates without any addition of reducing agent or flashing with inert gases. As E. coli could not produce H2 from non-hydrolyzed crude homogenate of rotten date palm fruits, a small amount of glucose 1 g L−1 was added to the fermentor and installation of anaerobic conditions was conducted overnight with no flashing with inert gases. Evolution of H2 by E. coli EGY was used as indicator of installing anaerobic condition. The total volume of H2 produced by E. coli was 100 mL. 3.2.2 Second stage: dark fermentation using C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 As E. coli EGY could not produce H2 from non-hydrolyzed crude homogenate of rotten dates, such facultative anaerobe was used to maintenance strict anaerobic conditions for H2 production by an obligate anaerobic C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 from the crude sugars of rotten dates (Fig. 2 ). Hydrogen production by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 started after 12 h of inoculation (Fig. 2). The effect of the substrate concentration on biohydrogen production from rotten dates homogenates was investigated. The highest cumulative H2 (2 L) and formation rate (2.56 mmol H2 h−1 L−1) were obtained with the 10 g L−1 sucrose concentration (Fig. 3 ). However, the highest yield (6.1 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose) was obtained with the 2.5 g L−1 sucrose concentration (Fig. 3). It is more advantageous to operate the fermentation at moderate sugar concentrations (5 g L−1) to obtain a high H2 yields (5.2 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose) and a moderate formation rate (2.1 mmol H2 h−1 L−1). 3.2.3 Third stage: photofermentation using R. capsulatus DSM 1710 In a third stage, R. capsulatus DSM 1710 was injected after 40 h from the C. acetobutylicum inoculation. Hydrogen production by R. capsulatus DSM 1710 was followed for 4 days and the total H2 yield was recorded (Table 2 ). The maximum total H2 yield of all stages was obtained with the (5 g L−1) sucrose concentration of rotten dates (7.8 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose) which was higher than that obtained from pure sucrose (6.9 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose) (Table 2). Application of such optimum concentration of sucrose (5 g L−1) of rotten date palm fruits showed the highest estimated cumulative H2 yield (162 LH2 kg−1 fresh rotten date fruits) from the three stages used in the present protocol (Fig. 4 ). The application of N2 sparging and addition of a reducing agent (l-cysteine) produced similar amounts of hydrogen as compared with anaerobiosis generated by E. coli."
12,Discussion,"In this study rotten dates homogenates were used as a substrate for dark and photofermentative H2 production for investigating the efficiency of using such waste materials in future industrial application of biological H2 production. H2 production by sequential three stages fermentation by E. coli EGY and C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and R. capsulatus DSM 1710 was investigated. The chemical composition of date fruits varies among various species and influenced by the stage of ripening [46]. Sucrose represented 42% of rotten date palm fruits used in this study and it contained no detectable reducing sugars. That might be the reason for the inability of E. coli to produce H2 from the non-hydrolyzed rotten date palm fruits indicating that the facultative anaerobic E. coli could not degrade the non-reducing sugars of rotten dates. Thus, E. coli was added to the fermentor to maintenance anaerobic condition for H2 production by the strictly anaerobic C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 with no reducing agents added or flashing with nitrogen or argon gases. As E. coli EGY could not degrade the non-reducing sugars of rotten dates, a small amount of glucose (0.1%) was added to the fermentor. So that, generation of H2 by E. coli can be used as indicator for the installation of anaerobic condition. The facultative anaerobes such as E. coli EGY are able to consume O2 in a medium and so a steady anaerobic condition in a fermentor was attained without addition of any reducing agent. Clostridium sp. is extremely sensitive to O2 and their H2-producing abilities are inhibited by a slight amount of O2 in a fermentor, so the addition of a reducing agent such as l-cysteine in a medium is indispensable for its H2 production. However, such reducing agents are expensive and so the procedure for H2 production by Clostridium sp. without the reducing agent is desired. The inability of E. coli to degrade rotten dates is a desired character of the facultative anaerobes used in such protocol so that the H2 production is related to Clostridium only which produces H2 by higher efficiency than E. coli. In this study, control experiments for H2 production by Clostridium from rotten dates homogenates were conducted after flashing with nitrogen and addition of l-cysteine as a reducing agent without addition of E. coli and comparable results were obtained (data not shown). A mixed continuous culture of Clostridium butyricum and Enterobacter aerogenes removed O2 in a fermentor and produced H2 from starch with yield of more than 2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose without any reducing agents in the medium [47]. The use of facultative anaerobes to remove oxygen from the medium was effective for H2 and acetone–butanol production by Clostridium [48]. Moreover, aerobic Bacillus may function as an oxygen consumer in the mixed culture to create an anaerobic environment for Clostridium [49,50]. Since photosynthetic bacteria utilize organic acids, by-products produced by fermentative bacteria in H2 production, a microbial H2 production by a mixed culture of the fermentative bacteria and the photosynthetic bacteria has become a subject of considerable interest [22]. The spent media containing organic acids after H2 production by C. acetobutylicum were used as a substrate for the second stage H2 production using R. capsulatus in light. Dark fermentation with mainly acidogenic bacteria (Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp.) has the ability to produce H2 while converting organic substrates into volatile fatty acids and alcohols [26,51]. These soluble metabolites (e.g., acetic acid, butyric acid) can be further utilized via photofermentation (with photosynthetic bacteria, such as purple non-sulfur bacteria) resulting in more H2 production at the expense of light energy [52–57]. H2 production by Rhodobacter is associated mainly or completely with the action of nitrogenase. Since, the primary inhibitor/repressor of nitrogenase is oxygen, which irreversibly destroys this enzyme; the fermentor should be flashed with gases other than oxygen. In presence of nitrogen gas H2 is liberated as a byproduct of nitrogenase activity: (1) N2 + 8H+ + 8e− + 16 (Mg)ATP → 2NH3 + H2 + 16 (Mg)ADP + 16Pi However, Flashing with nitrogen gas is not recommended as large amounts of ATP and reducing power are consumed in the nitrogen fixation per se and little H2 is produced in comparison to the enzyme activity in absence of molecular nitrogen (2) 2H+ + 2e− + 4ATP → H2 + 4ADP + 4Pi In the presence of N2 the nitrogen fixation reaction dominates (Eq. (1)) and H2 production (Eq. (2)) is insignificant (if any) [58]. Thus argon is usually used for flashing the fermentor for H2 production by generally the purple non-sulfur bacteria. However argon is expensive to be used. In this study, R. capsulatus DSM 1710 was injected to the closed anaerobic fermentor by a syringe at the third photofermentation stage with no flashing by argon and H2 was efficiently produced. Although Rhodobacter is also a facultative anaerobe that can be mixed with clostridium with no need to E. coli, in the present study, the addition of R. capsulatus along with clostridium showed a lower maximum total H2 yield (5.5 mol H2 mol−1 sucrose) than the sequential protocol used which yield 7.8 M H2/mol sucrose. It is interesting to mention that the addition of the three organisms at the start of the experiment produced a lower yield either in continuous illumination or sequential dark and light periods than the described protocol (data not shown), since the addition of R. capsulatus DSM 1710 along with C. acetobutylicum might compensate for the sugar substrate utilization in their growth. The results presented herein suggest that rotten date palm fruits can be efficiently used for commercial biological H2 production especially in the Arab countries where the date palm trees are extensively cultivated. Date production is an international agricultural industry which has produced approximately 5.4 million metric tons (Mt) of fruit over the period 1999–2001 [59]. The date fruit is produced largely in the hot arid regions of Southwest Asia and North Africa. On average, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq had almost half of the harvested area of the world during this period. Date fruits were approved to contain adequate nutrients in satisfactory amounts to be suitable for growth of microorganisms [60]. Date fruits homogenate is rich in carbohydrates (75% w/w) and contains small amounts of protein and fat (1.1 and 2.9%, respectively) [61] in addition to many macro- and micro-elements [62,63]. Moreover, date fruits contain some vitamins (C, B1, B2, B3 and A) [64]. Arab countries possess 70% of the 120 million world's date palms and are responsible for 67% of the global date production [65]. Egypt has been the world's largest producer of dates since 1974 [65] and reports very high average yield compared to other countries. This is said to be due to good access to water by palms growing along the Nile valley [66]. As mentioned before, Egypt is one of the biggest producers of the date fruit in the world. Many microorganisms have been associated with spoilage of date fruits [67–70]. High percentage (35% of the total crop) of the date fruit crop is lost due to damage or low quality hindering export and local consumption [71,72]. Thus, it seems necessary to use this source for bioenergy production. It has potential to be used as a substrate replacing common carbon and mineral sources. It also contains a substantial level of nutrients and vitamins that are required for bacterial growth. The constituents of rotten dates can eliminate the need for expensive synthetic medium constituents. This study relies on using low quality date fruits as a fermentation medium to produce biohydrogen. The proportion of the date crop that currently goes to waste can be turned into useful energy. Because of the high cost of commercial prepared culture media, it is envisioned that date waste can be used as feedstock for the biological H2 production. Glucose, sucrose and starch are the fermentation substrates most studied in the laboratory [73–75]. Ueno et al. [18] operated a laboratory reactor continuously for over 200 days on sugar factory wastewater and obtained a yield of 2.52 mol H2 mol−1 glucose from sugar factory wastewater by a mixed microflora in chemostat culture. Lay [76] using mixed microflora with 0.75% soluble starch obtained 2.14 mol H2 mol−1 hexose. To date the majority of research has been directed at expensive pure substrates or to a much lesser degree solid waste or wastewaters, however for a truly sustainable process and to meet the demand for renewable energy more sustainable feedstocks will need to be utilized. These could include sugar-containing crops such as sweet sorghum and sugar beet, starch based crops such as corn or wheat, or ligno-cellulosics such as fodder grass and Miscanthus. Cheese whey supplemented with many minerals is another valuable substrate which contains approximately 44–50 g L−1 lactose. Clostridia can hydrolyze lactose to its component sugars followed by their use for producing H2 [77]. The maximum H2 yield produced from rotten dates in this study is quite good when compared with values using other substrates reported in literature (Table 3 ). Also, this study has shown that the use of E. coli EGY as facultative anaerobe for co-culturing with C. acetobutylicum could enhance H2 production from the non-reducing crude sugars of rotten date palm fruits. Hence, the production costs of fermentation such as reducing agents and argon gas for ensuring the anaerobic environment could be reduced. The addition of R. capsulatus DSM 1710 to the E. coli EGY and C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 mixture in a late stage, increased the total H2 yield and the described protocol did not require a reducing agent or flashing with argon."
13,Conclusion,"This study has shown that rotten fruits of date palm can be used as an inexpensive renewable substrate for biological H2 production. The study also indicated that the facultative anaerobic E. coli EGY can be used to install and maintain anaerobic conditions for a second stage H2 production by the strictly anaerobic C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. A third stage photofermentation using R. capsulatus DSM 1710 has been conducted to utilize organic acids produced from the dark fermentation stages. In terms of economical benefits, the H2 production from rotten dates by mixed culture without anaerobic pretreatment (reducing agent and flashing with argon) in this study reveals a great potential for furthering industrialized H2 production."
