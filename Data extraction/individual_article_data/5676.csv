0,Introduction,"In recent years, 3D printing became an encouraging technology for the production of nanocomposites for bone tissue engineering [1,2]. In-situ biomimetic mineralization of hydroxyapatite/3D scaffold is one of the most important applications of biomaterials to replace damaged hard tissues and repair bone defects [3]. Several biomaterials can be used for the preparation of bone tissue scaffolds. These biomaterials must meet certain requirements such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, appropriate mechanical strength and low cytotoxicity [4,5]. Synthetic polymers, such as aliphatic polyesters, have been extensively investigated and tested, like polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDO), and polytrimethylene carbonate (PTMC) [6–8]. Nevertheless, natural biopolymers are becoming a valid alternative for the substitution of synthetic polymers for manufacturing 3D scaffolds because of several advantages, such as biodegradability, availability, and low cost. Also, natural polymers have demonstrated the potential advantage of supporting cell function and adhesion. Some natural polymers are water soluble, which means that these polymers dissolve in cell-friendly medium, such as cell culture medium and phosphate-buffered saline, to form solutions/hydrogels [9]. Collagen, alginate, gelatin and chitosan which are interesting compounds for tissue engineering [5,10–12] are emerging as outstanding materials for the manufacturing of 3D scaffolds. Alginate is a natural biopolymer, which consists of two monosaccharide units: glucuronic acid and mannuronic acid. It has been commonly used as scaffold in tissue engineering, drug delivery and cell encapsulation due its biocompatibility, biodegradability and easy gelation with divalent cations under normal physiological conditions [13]. Similarly, cellulose nanofibers (CNF) have attracted increased interest in scientific and industrial research because of their unique properties, including sustainability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, high specific surface area, high mechanical strength, and abundant availability [14–16]. In addition to their physical properties, CNFs can be easily derived from various cellulose sources (such as wood or plant fibers) by using different techniques, i.e. pure mechanical shearing of cellulose fibers or a combination of chemical, enzymatic pretreatments and mechanical disintegration [17]. Owing to their high mechanical properties and extremely low percolation threshold, CNFs have been effectively used as reinforcing agent for various synthetic and natural polymers [18–20]. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a biodegradable and environmentally friendly synthetic polymer, with good thermal stability, optical properties and high oxygen barrier properties. It is widely used in various applications such as water purification [21], packaging [22] and tissue engineering [23]. In this study, we developed nanocellulose reinforced polymers with the objective of achieving a completely bio-based, new structural material for additive manufacturing, which is a new area of research. The development of viscoelastic inks that can be readily extruded, and yet form self-supporting features after exiting the nozzle, is challenging. PVA was crosslinked with bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF) bearing both carboxyl and aldehyde groups, in order to form stable cyclic acetal bonds with the hydroxyl groups of PVA. PVA-grafted CNFs were mixed with alginate to form more flexible and softer 3D printed scaffolds than those made with pure alginate. To the best our knowledge, such alginate/PVA-grafted BF-CNF/SA hydrogel has never been used for 3D extrusion printing. It was achieved in three steps. The first step consisted in the TEMPO oxidation of cellulose fibers and the generation of carboxyl groups at C6 position. The second step involved the mechanical defibrillation of oxidized fibers and the production of cellulose nanofibers (T-CNF). In the last step, periodate oxidation of T-CNF induced the formation of dialdehyde moieties in position C2 and C3 with the cleavage of the C2-C3 bond. The obtained bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF) were used as a potential cross-linker for PVA with the formation of stable acetal bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the aldehyde groups of BF-CNF. The addition of BF-CNF clearly improves the stiffness of the hydrogel, which was found to be homogenous. In order to evaluate bone precursor nucleation and growth, calcium phosphate was in situ mineralized on 3D porous scaffolds prepared with alginate/PVA-grafted CNFs hydrogels. The effect of pH (4 or 8) on the formation of calcium phosphate was also investigated showing that, in addition to their excellent dimensional stability, the developed scaffolds are homogeneously coated with a mineral layer. The 3D printed sodium alginate/PVA grafted CNF hydrogels turn to be promising scaffold materials for bone tissue engineering."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cellulose nanofibers were prepared from bleached bagasse pulp which was supplied from Quena Company of Paper Industry (Egypt). All the chemical reagents (hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium alginate (SA), sodium periodate (NaIO4), disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), sodium bromide (NaBr) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF),"2.2 Preparation of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF) TEMPO-oxidized bleached bagasse pulp was prepared according to a previously published method [10,24]. The first step consisted in dispersing the bleached bagasse pulp (5 g) in 500 mL of distilled water with 0.08 mg (0.5 mmol) of TEMPO and 0.8 mg of sodium bromide (8 mmol). Then, 50 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution were added under stirring and the pH was adjusted to 10. At the end of the reaction, the pH was adjusted to 7 and the product was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 30 min. The obtained modified fibers were further purified by several centrifugation cycles, i.e. the sediment was collected, diluted with distilled water and centrifuged. Finally, the modified cellulose was purified by dialysis for one week against deionized water. After the TEMPO reaction, the product was defibrillated with a Masuko grinder in order to obtaining TEMPO-oxidized CNF (T-CNF). Periodate oxidation of T-CNF was carried out according to a procedure described elsewhere [25]. 12 g of T-CNF diluted to 1% consistency were heated to 60 °C in a water bath, 46 mmol of sodium periodate (NaIO4) were added and the reaction container was covered with an aluminum foil to avoid periodate photo-induced decomposition. The reaction was stopped after 3 h by washing the resulting dialdehyde cellulose nanofiber with distilled water and filtering it in a funnel."
4,Preparation of alginate filament using 3D printing,"2.3 Preparation of alginate filament using 3D printing 2.5 g of PVA were dissolved in 0.5 mol·L−1 of Na2HPO4. Then 0, 5, 10 and 15% of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (with respect to the PVA content) were added. The PVA control sample was dissolved in water without Na2HPO4. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 4 using a 0.1 mol·L−1 HCl solution and mixing vigorously for 4 h at 40 °C. Then, 5 g of sodium alginate (SA) were added to the previous solution while keeping the mechanical stirring. The mixed pastes were filled into a 50 mL plastic syringe with a diameter of 15 mm. A metal nozzle with an end diameter of 0.5 mm was connected to the syringe and the syringe was placed in an in-home modified 3D printer (Leapfrog, Creatr HS model) connected with a screw-pump paste extruder (Wasp, claystruder). The extruded PVA/alginate filaments were printed in a cylindrical flask filled with a CaCl2 solution in order to cross-link alginate. The extrusion head speed was set at 1000 mm·min−1 and the hydrogel syringe was fed with a pressure of 0.5 bars. The width of the filament and the layer height were set at 0.6 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. The extruded filaments were left in the flask for 2 min, after which the filaments were putted in straight line."
5,Preparation of 3D printed scaffolds and mineralization,"2.4 Preparation of 3D printed scaffolds and mineralization 3D scaffolds with cuboid shape and nominal size of 20 × 20 × 10 mm3 were printed. It is worth noting that a CaCl2 solution (0.05 mol·L−1) was sprayed after each layer to induce partial crosslinking of alginate and strengthen the hydrogel. Afterwards, all the fabricated scaffolds were soaked in 0.5 mol·L−1 CaCl2 in order to complete the crosslinking of alginate and promote the in situ mineralization of calcium phosphate. The pH was adjusted, directly after mixing, to 4 and 8 using 0.1 mol·L−1 HCl and NaOH, respectively. The mixtures were stirred smoothly during three days at room temperature. Milky white materials were produced immediately on the surface of the fabricated scaffolds due to the formation of calcium phosphate. The crosslinked scaffolds were thoroughly washed with deionized water three times and freeze-dried for further characterization."
6,Determination of the carboxylate content,"2.5 Determination of the carboxylate content The carboxylate content of both T-CNF and BF-CNF was determined by conductimetric titration. In brief, dried sample of T-CNF or BF-CNF (~50 mg) was mixed with 0.01 M HCl (15 mL), the mixture was vigorously stirred until well-dispersed and titrated with 0.01 M NaOH solution. The carboxylate content of T-CNF or BF-CNF was determined by the sudden change in conductivity according to Eq. (1). (1) C = V 1 − V o × C NaOH m where C (mmol·g−1) is the carboxylate group content, V1 and Vo are the volumes of standard NaOH solution before and after titration, CNaOH is the concentration of standard NaOH solution, and m is the weight of the dried sample."
7,Determination of the aldehyde content,"2.6 Determination of the aldehyde content The aldehyde content of periodate oxidized T-CNF (BF-CNF) was based on oxime reaction between aldehyde group and NH2OH·HCl as reported [25,26]. Briefly, 0.1 g dry weight of BF-CNF was reacted with NH2OH·HCL (2.0 g) in 100 mL methanol solution at room temperature, and thymol blue used as a pH indicator. After 3 h reaction, the titration of the produced HCl was performed using NaOH methanol solution (0.03 M). The reactions and calculation formula are as follows: (2) (3) HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H 2 O (4) C = 30 V m mmol g − 1 where C is the aldehyde contents group; V is the volume of NaOH methanol solution (0.03 M) in mL, and m is the weight of oven-dried sample in g."
8,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,"2.7 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy KBr discs were obtained by mixing 10 mg of material with 300 mg of KBr. The FTIR spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) in the wavenumber range 4000–500 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and an accumulation of 16 scans per analysis. FTIR spectra were recorded."
9,X-ray diffraction,"2.8 X-ray diffraction X-ray powder diffraction was carried out on finely grinded scaffolds, before and after mineralization, at the MCX beamline at Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, Trieste, Italy [27,28]. The sample was poured in a thin walled borosilicate glass capillary with a diameter of 1.0 mm. The wavelength used for the data collection was 0.827 Å and the data were collected in the 2θ range (3–50°). In order to improve particle distribution statistics, the capillary was rotated during data collection."
10,Thermogravimetric analysis,2.9 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermal properties of the prepared samples were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The analysis was done using PerkinElmer TGA thermogravimetric analyzer under air flux from 25 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 min−1. The analyses were conducted in duplicate.
11,Morphological investigation,"2.10 Morphological investigation The scaffolds were observed using an optical microscope ZEISS Stereo Discovery V20 with an AxioCam ICc 5. Atomic force microscopy (AFM Multimode — DI, Veeco, Instrumentation Group) in tapping mode with multi 130 tips was used to characterize T-CNF and BF-CNF. The surface morphology of the prepared scaffold before and after mineralization was imaged using a scanning electron microscope (FEI-Quanta 2000, ESEMTM) equipped with a EDX Unit (Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyses)."
12,Mechanical testing of the filaments,"2.11 Mechanical testing of the filaments The prepared filaments were air dried and conditioned at 50% relative humidity for 3 days before tensile testing. Tensile tests were performed with an Instron model 5569 with a load cell of 5 kN and a crosshead speed of 10 mm·min−1. The diameter of the filaments ranged between 300 and 400 μm, which was measured using a ZEISS Stereo Discovery V20 with an AxioCam ICc 5 as shown in Fig. 1 . The images obtained were analyzed using the image J “Analyze stripes v2.4.5.b” plugin to estimate the filament diameter. Blue hill software was used for test control and collection of the data. The data collected were used to calculate the modulus of elasticity which was taken from the slope of the stress-strain curves. Five samples were tested for average and standard deviation calculation."
13,Rheological characterization,"2.12 Rheological characterization The rheological behavior of all prepared hydrogels was determined using a MCR 301 rheometer (Anton Paar). A parallel plate 25 mm in diameter was used and the gap distance was set to 1 mm. A cover was used to prevent water evaporation during measurements, and the temperature was maintained at 23 °C. The samples were equilibrated 1 min to remove any previous shear history. The viscosity was measured for shear rates ranging from 10−3 to 103 s−1. The viscoelasticity of all materials was examined and the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) was estimated from amplitude sweep tests conducted at the frequency of 1 Hz and strain ranging from 0.1 to 100%."
14,Results and discussion,"Scheme 1 presents the different steps for the production of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF) using chemical and mechanical treatments. The first step consisted in the TEMPO oxidation of cellulose fibers and the generation of carboxyl groups at C6 position. The second step corresponded to the mechanical defibrillation of oxidized fibers and the production of cellulose nanofibers (T-CNF). In the last step, periodate oxidation of T-CNF induced the formation of dialdehyde moieties in position C2 and C3 with the cleavage of the C2-C3 bond. The carboxylate content of T-CNF, which was 0.9 mmol·g−1 (as estimated by conductimetric titration), slightly increased after the periodate oxidation and reached 1.3 mmol·g−1, whereas the aldehyde content reached 2.5 mmol·g−1."
15,Characterization of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers,"3.1 Characterization of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. 2 confirm the effective oxidation of cellulose by TEMPO and periodate. After TEMPO oxidation, a new band, corresponding to the CO stretching of carbonyl groups, was detected at 1743 cm−1. A significant increase in the carbonyl groups band was observed after periodate oxidation of cellulose-CNF due to the formation of aldehyde groups. Peaks observed around 880 cm−1 are assigned to the formation of hemiacetal bonds between the carbonyl groups and neighboring hydroxyl groups at the C1 position. T-CNF and BF-CNF were also examined by AFM and images are shown in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. It can be noticed that the nanofibers become thinner and shorter after periodate oxidation, which can be attributed to loosening adhesion between microfibrils and the electrostatic repulsions between the surface charges. This study intends to show the use of bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF) as a potential cross-linker for PVA with the formation of stable acetal bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the aldehyde groups of BF-CNF as depicted in Fig. 3A. Fig. 3B shows the FTIR spectra for BF-CNF and PVA-crosslinked BF-CNF. A reduction in the absorbance peak intensity at 1745 cm−1 is observed due to the formation of acetal bonds. In addition, acetal linkage (COC) stretching vibrations near 1100 cm−1 are observed for PVA-crosslinked BF-CNF."
16,Rheological characterization of hydrogels,"3.2 Rheological characterization of hydrogels The rheological behavior of PVA/SA hydrogels with different BF-CNF contents was studied at 23 °C to investigate how the viscosity changes with the shear rate during the printing the process at room temperature. The viscosity of all hydrogels was measured for shear rates ranging from 0.01 to 1000 s−1. Fig. 4A shows that all the prepared hydrogels exhibit a shear-thinning behavior with viscosity decreasing when increasing the shear rate [29]. This behavior can be associated to the typical disruption of the hydrogel nanofiber network at high shear rates [30]. The increase in the BF-CNF content (with respect to PVA) led to higher viscosity values which are correlated with the dense entanglement among nanofibers, which was confirmed with SEM observation (Fig. 5 ). The linear viscoelastic region (LVR) and the yield stress of the prepared hydrogels were determined using amplitude sweep experiments at a constant frequency of 1 Hz. At low strain values, the storage modulus (G′) and the loss modulus (G″) were independent from the strain amplitude and the storage modulus was higher than the loss modulus, thus indicating that prepared hydrogels are highly structured. For higher strain values, the storage modulus progressively decreased revealing the destructuration of the hydrogel and the transition from an elastic to a viscous behavior when G′/G″ < 1. The critical strain (γc), corresponding to the transition from the linear viscoelastic region to the viscous region (i.e. the point where G′ shows 5% reduction from its LVR value) [31] was lower than 1% for most of the prepared hydrogels. Therefore, a strain value of 0.5% was selected to study the linear viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels in order to avoid hydrogel destructuration. Among tested hydrogels, PVA/15%BF-CNF/SA exhibited the highest storage modulus, which is in line with a denser crosslinking and a higher nanofiber concentration."
17,Tensile properties of PVA/BF-CNF/SA filaments,"3.3 Tensile properties of PVA/BF-CNF/SA filaments Fig. 6A shows the stress-strain curves for bare filaments for different BF-CNF contents. The addition of BF-CNF to the pristine hydrogel induced a drop in the strain at break value from ca. 4% to 1.5% and an increase in both the strength and the Young modulus from 20 MPa and 0.5 GPa to 26–32 MPa and 2.5 GPa, respectively. We tried a concentration of 2.5% BF-CNF, and no significant effect was observed. The neat change in the mechanical properties of the dry filament and the shift to a brittle behavior were interpreted as reflecting the formation of a dense CNF network even for low (5%) BF-CNF contents."
18,Characterization of 3D printed scaffolds,"3.4 Characterization of 3D printed scaffolds Fig. 7 shows the aspect of 3D printed scaffolds (20 × 20 × 8 mm3) in wet state (Fig. 7A and B) and freeze dried after soaking in water (control sampler) (Fig. 7C) and in CaCl2 solution (Fig. 7D). By comparing Fig. 7C and D it is observed that soaking the sample in the CaCl2 solution induced the generation of a rough surface and a slight increase in the diameter of the bare filament. These morphological changes can be ascribed to the reaction between calcium and phosphate ions on the surface of the dry filaments composing the printed scaffold. As shown in Fig. 8 FTIR spectra for the scaffolds prepared with and without addition of Na2HPO4 at different pHs (4 and 8) revealed the presence of the absorption bands typical of the PO stretching vibration mode ν3 at wavenumbers 1160 and 1049 cm−1, OPO bending vibration mode ν4 at 550 and 600 cm−1 and PO mode ν1 at 894 cm−1 which were absent for PVA/SA scaffolds (Fig. 8A). XRD spectra for PVA/BF-CNF/SA/calcium phosphate hybrids at different pHs are shown in Fig. 9 . A broad peak is observed around 2θ = 10.3° which is a common peak for polysaccharides, i.e. cellulose and alginate in the current hybrid. Moreover, at pH 8 (Fig. 9B), the formed hybrid showed characteristic signals at 2θ = 26°, 27.8°, 32.9°, 39.0° and 43.6° which are associated with the diffraction pattern of hydroxyapatite. In contrast, calcium phosphate precipitated at pH 4 (Fig. 9A) showed reflections at 2θ = 11.4°, 18.1°, 22.1°, 25.3°, 28.0°, 30.9°, 34.8° and 36.97°, that correspond to dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPDH) crystal phase formation. The peaks observed for the scaffold mineralized at pH 4 are very sharp reflecting a high crystallinity and big size of the crystallites for the calcium phosphate precipitated on the scaffold surface. SEM images for the 3D printed and freeze dried PVA/BF-CNF/SA hydrogels are shown in Fig. 10 . For the sample without calcium phosphate mineralization (Fig. 10A), the morphology is relatively homogenous and no clear evidence of a separated phase can be observed. The micrographs for scaffolds after calcium phosphate mineralization at pH 4 (Fig. 10B and C) showed large and thin platelets on the surface of PVA/BF-CNF/SA. The size distribution of the crystals is fairly uniform (from ca. 2 to 10 μm) and the crystal shape is well developed. It is also clear that the platelets do not occur as individual crystals, but form dense aggregates with steps and overgrowth of other crystals. In contrast to the hybrid grown at pH 4, the samples developed at pH 8 exhibit a relatively uniform porous morphology. This porous structure consists of hierarchical nanoplatelets (smaller than 100 nm). These observations agree with FTIR and XRD results. The effect of the pH of the mineralization environment on the morphology of precipitated calcium phosphate was already reported in the literature [32,33]. Salama et al. [34] observed that cellulose/calcium phosphate hybrids prepared in the presence of glacial acetic acid were characterized by the presence of calcium phosphate crystals with a micrometric lamellar structure while in the presence of sodium hydroxide crystals had a uniform structure with nanometric size. The TGA thermograms for the prepared scaffolds are shown in Fig. 11 . All samples exhibited a major weight loss in the temperature range 220–350 °C, which is typical for carbohydrate polymers. At 800 °C, the weight loss for PVA/BF-CNF/SA in the absence of calcium phosphate (blank) was79% whereas the weight loss for mineralized scaffolds formed at pH 4 and pH 8 was ca. 47%. Assuming a negligible interaction between the organic and inorganic phases during scaffold pyrolysis, the mass fraction of apatite in scaffolds mineralized at pH 4 and pH 8 can be estimated as 32%, thus indicating the effective crystallization of calcium phosphate."
19,Conclusions,"In this work, bifunctional cellulose nanofibers (BF-CNF) were prepared with reactive carboxyl and aldehyde groups and used for the crosslinking of PVA. Crosslinked PVA/alginate scaffolds were fabricated in the presence of Na2HPO4 via 3D printing and a subsequent in situ mineralization of calcium phosphate during scaffold crosslinking by immersion in a CaCl2 solution. The Young's modulus of cross-linked PVA/alginate scaffolds was increased from 0.54 ± 0.01 GPa for 0% BF-CNF to 2.76 ± 0.26 GPa when adding 15% BF-CNF. The pH of the mineralization process had a major effect on the nucleation and growth of calcium phosphate and XRD and SEM analysis showed that the mineral phase in the final hybrid material was mainly composed by dispersed lamellar hydroxyapatite at pH 8 and a homogeneous layer of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPDH) nanocrystals at pH 4. Overall, the prepared PVA/BF-CNF/SA scaffolds with nano-DCPDH could be promising substrates for bone tissue engineering application."
