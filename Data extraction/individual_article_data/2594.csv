0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic technology is considered as a promising solution to the deficient in energy and environmental pollution problems faced by human beings [1,2]. In typical photocatalytic, the electron-hole pairs of the photocatalyst are metastable [3]. It is easy to recombine in the form of thermal radiation before migrating to the active site of the photocatalyst surface, which is adverse to the photocatalytic reaction process of the photocatalyst [4,5]. Therefore, accelerating the separation efficiency of carriers and prolonging the lifetime of carriers are conducive to improving the photocatalytic efficiency [6,7]. As a common semiconductor, Cd x Zn1- x S has obtained a wide range of research at domestic and overseas thanks to its narrow energy gap, good visible light response and adjustable energy gap [8–10]. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of Cd x Zn1- x S is still affected by the rapid electron-hole pairs recombination. Therefore, it is crucial to further probe the modified Cd x Zn1- x S system under visible light to improve the photocatalytic activity [11–13].So far, several photocatalysts have been exploited for photocatalytic hydrogen production, for instance Cd0.8Zn0.2S/C3N4 [14], Ni2P-Cd0.9Zn0.1S/g-C3N4 [15], CoFe2O4/Cd0.9Zn0.1S [16], MoS2/Cd0.9Zn0.1S [17] and Zn0.1Cd0.9S/Snln4S8 [18]. These photocatalysts promote the separation and transfer of carriers and hence improve the photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, merely increasing the interface through nanostructures unable solve the electrons and holes recombination problem. In recent years, plasma photocatalyst has attracted much attention as promising excellent performance photocatalytic technology [19]. It is known that the LSPR spectrum of precious metal nanoparticles can be regulated by alteration in the size, shape, component or dielectric environment of the nanoparticles [20–22]. However, metals lack tunability, which can only be furnished by semiconductors [22,23]. Namely, by changing the carriers concentration, the physical parameter of the square of the LSPR frequency can be determined, as described in the Drude model [24–26]. The carriers density in precious metals like Au and Ag are relatively high (about 1023 cm−3) and stubborn to change distinctly [24,27]. In contrary, the carrier density of semiconductor is 1017 ~ 1021 cm−3 by doping and introducing defects [28,29]. Since 2009, Zhao et al. reported first that copper sulfide (Cu2- x S) nanocrystals (NCs) showed LSPR in the near-infrared, which cause the rapid development of the field of doped semiconductor NCs [30]. Cu2- x S is composed of multiple doped stoichiometric ratios, consequently, increasing the carrier concentration that can retain the near-infrared LPSR [30,31]. This near-infrared LSPR has many of the same properties as the precious metal visible range LSPR [30]. Shortly after, Luther et al. have demonstrated that essentially any semiconductor NCs with appreciable carriers concentrations can sustain LSPR [32]. Since then, metal-like LSPR have been found in various semiconductor, including CuSe [33], WO3 [34], In2O3 [35], Cu2Te [36], GeTe [37], and ZnO [38]. In this paper, BS with S vacancies are synthesized by simple and mild microwave assisted methods. The preparation time is shorter than that of conventional solvothermal method. The density of BS carriers with S vacancies are concentrated between 1017 ~ 1021 cm−3, and they have LSPR similar to precious metals. The LSPR of BS can be used as an electrons donor in the photocatalytic process, and the improved photocatalytic system enables the semiconductor carriers to be effectively separated. LSPR significantly improved the hydrogen production efficiency of CZS/BS-1.5 nanocomposite, with the hydrogen production rate up to 16.3 mmol·h−1·g−1, which are 2.3 and 5.6 times of CZS and BS, respectively. These results provide a new idea for improving photocatalytic hydrogen production effectively."

9,Results and discussion,
10,Characteristics,"3.1 Characteristics The two-step synthesis procedure of CZS/BS-1.5 nanospheres is demonstrated in Fig. 1 (a). The first step is to composite CZS nanospheres by microwave assisted method, and then proceed to regulate the Bi/S molar ratio to compound CZS/BS-1.5. It still has admirable dispersion and maintain preferable morphology compared with CZS nanospheres, indicating good stability of CZS/BS-1.5 synthesized by microwave assisted (Fig. 1b, c and S1). As shown in Fig. S2, the hydronium ion radius can represent the particle size of about 20–30 nm. Fig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of CZS/BS-X photocatalysts with different Bi/S molar ratios. Because the S source cannot be completely converted to S-2 to participate in the reaction. If the content of S source is insufficient, Bi atoms cannot form the structure of approximate tetragonal pyramid polyhedron in the way of five coordination. Therefore, there will be S vacancies in the crystal structure. It can be seen that the compound CZS/BS-1, CZS/BS-1.5 and CZS/BS-2 have similar diffraction peaks. The peaks of these samples indicate that their crystallinity is unexceptionable, and all the peaks are completely matched with CZS (01-0647) and BS (PDF#02-0391). All the diffraction peaks at 25.17°, 27.17°, 29.60°, 31.86°, 44.73°, 46.69° and 55.57° that can be assigned to (130), (111), (211), (221), (220), (431) and (311), respectively. The (111), (220) and (311) crystal planes are classified as CZS nanoparticles, the (130), (211), (221), (431) and (311) are attributed to BS nanoparticles. further prove that CZS, CZS/BS and CZS/BS-X have been synthesized [11]. At the same time, it is concluded that CZS nanoparticles is cubic crystal phase. To investigate the internal structure of CZS/BS-1.5, HRTEM (Fig. 1e, f, g and S3) are performed. In addition, the lattice spacing of 0.32 nm attributed to the (111) crystallographic planes, 0.34 nm and 0.37 nm correspond to (220) and (311) lattice plane of CZS, respectively. The compact with the interplanar spacing of 0.36 nm and 0.23 nm can be attributable to (130) and (431) crystal plane of BS [39]. Meanwhile, the enlarged HRTEM can distinctly emerge the atomic arrangement details of CZS and BS lattice plane. In addition, we can observe that the lattice fringes in the yellow region are blurred and intermittent, indicating defect rich region (Fig. S4). The high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image and the homologous energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images (Fig. 1h-l) demonstrate the existence of the elements Cd, Zn, Bi and S in the CZS/BS-1.5 compound. The clear fringes observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Fig. 1m) indicate the polycrystalline property of CZS/BS-1.5 nanoparticles and presence of (111) planes of CZS and (130), (211) planes of BS. The surface chemical structure of the prepared CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5 are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Consistent with the XRD consequence, the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 2 a) clearly revealed the presence of Zn, Cd, C, S and O in the CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5 composite. The peaks appeared at 1021.6 eV and 1045.8 eV are categorized as Zn2+, in the CZS/BS nanocomposite, the peaks position of Zn2+ shifted to lower binding energy relative to CZS/BS-1.5 (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c display the XPS peaks of Cd 3d at 404.8 eV and 411.5 eV conform to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, the Cd2+ in CZS/BS is confirmed to be the same as the characteristic peaks of Zn 2p [40,17]. the characteristic peaks of Cd 3d also shifts to the low binding energy in the CZS/BS samples. This may be due to the heterojunction between CZS and BS, which forms strong coupling effect between them. The binding energies classified as Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 are 158.1 eV and 163.4 eV (Fig. 2d) respectively, it indicates that Bi exists as trivalent (Bi3+). The peaks at 160.6 eV and 162.7 eV are related to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 in S2− [41]. The binding energy of Bi 4f and S 2p of CZS/BS-1.5 sample gradually decreases, this is because of the S vacancies in CZS/BS-1.5 structure. Simultaneously, The S intensity of CZS/BS-1.5 is lower than CZS/BS, further proving that S vacancies leads to reduced S content (Table S1). In addition, the atomic ratio of Bi to S in CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5 was quantitatively analyzed by ICP-MS. The atomic ratio of Cd/Zn/Bi /S in CZS/BS is 1: 1: 1.8: 2.7, and the atomic ratio of CZS/BS-1.5 is 1: 1: 1.8: 1.6. By comparing the atomic ratio of CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5, it can be found that there are S vacancies in CZS/BS-1.5. The typical signal of S vacancy of CZS/BS-1.5 present g = 2.007 in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum. However, there is no obvious signal in EPR spectra of CZS and CZS/BS, which indicates that S vacancy are successfully confirmed on the surface of CZS/BS-1.5 nanoparticles [42]. According to Fig. 3 b, the Raman absorption peak of CZS/BS-1.5 have been significantly enhanced. This phenomenon further indicates Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering effect (SERS) [43]. The LSPR of CZS/BS-1.5 is due to the increase of carrier concentration by S vacancy. Therefore, it has strong visible light absorption and effectively improves the sensitivity of Raman spectrum. Carriers density depends on the relative contribution of S vacancies, these systems are evident when the LSPR energy is observed as a function of S vacancies. The CZS/BS of S free vacancies show low energy LSPR, and with the occurrence of S vacancies, the LSPR will have blue shift [44]. The photocatalytic process incorporate the dynamic generation, transfer and electrochemical utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes, but it is difficult to monitor. LSPR proved to be a useful tool for detecting this dynamic light process. When CZS/BS-X nanoparticles are irradiated with visible light, the accumulation of light excited electrons will appear in the CB. The frequency of the LSPR are 0.236 eV, 0.289 eV and 0.334 eV, respectively, which can be used as a measure of the number of charges in the CB. Electrons are used for surface redox reactions, and the decrease in LSPR band intensity is used to detect electrons (Fig. 3d)."
11,Optical and electrochemical characterization,"3.2 Optical and electrochemical characterization The optical absorption of BS, CZS, CZS/BS and CZS/BS-X samples prepared with different amounts of thiourea are characterized by UV–vis spectrometer (Fig. 4 a). With the increase of thiourea content, the absorption intensity in the 350–450 nm region significantly increased and the absorption edge red shifted, which can be attributed to the LSPR of BS. The introduction of S vacancy will lead to the existence of defect energy level between valence band and conduction band, and the defect energy level serves as the position of conduction band, thus shortening the band gap and improving the visible light absorption. Therefore, The absorption of CZS/BS-1.5 in visible light is stronger than that of CZS/BS-1 and CZS/BS-2, and the red shift of absorption edge is more obvious. Therefore, the enhancement of light absorption caused by LSPR effect is expected to lead to improved photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. PL emission spectrum was applied to research the photogenic electron and hole separation behavior in photocatalyst. In Fig. 4b, The peak position at 505 nm is the strongest due to the rapid recombination of CZS electron hole pair. On the contrary, CZS/BS-1.5 has weaker PL peak owing to rapid electron and hole transfer and shorter diffusion length.The analysis showed that with the increase of thiourea concentration, S vacancies are introduced to capture electrons and photoexcited electron-hole pairs are separated, thus effectively inhibiting electron-hole pairs recombination and valid improving photocatalytic performance. From the survey in time resolved PL decay spectra (Fig. 4c), the decay kinetic of CZS/BS-1.5 (16.19 ns) is relatively slow than that of CZS/BS (8.13 ns). The increase of carrier lifetime in CZS/BS-1.5 indicates that the photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated during the photocatalytic reaction. The measurement of surface photovoltage (SPV) is a sophisticated noncontact technique to study the photoinduced charges separation and transfer on the surface of this process [45]. The carriers can separate in the defective product from the bending or defect caused by the internal electric field from the wave segment [46]. All photocatalysts have definite SPV response, indicating that the absorption of photons stimulate the generation and separation of charges [47]. The positive photoelectric signal indicates that the holes move from the interior to the surface, while the negative photovoltage response indicates that the electrons transfer from the interior to the surface [48]. charges separation induced by defect and positive SPV detected by CZS/BS-1.5 is significantly increased (Fig. 4d). As electrons are captured by S vacancies, more holes congest on the surface and SPV signals of CZS/BS-1.5 crack on the surface show more normal distribution [49]. The above results showed that the introduction of S vacancies significantly improved the separation efficiency of carriers and promoted the photocatalytic activity [50]. The band gaps of CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5 compound are evaluated from the Tauc-plot (Fig. S5a) by Kubelka-Munk method, which are 2.29 eV and 2.17 eV, respectively. Due to the existence of S vacancies, the band gap of CZS/BS-1.5 is reduced. The valance band (VB) of the photocatalysts are determined by XPS spectra in Fig. S5b. It can be seen that the VB of CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5 have no obvious changes, which are 1.33 eV (vs. Fermi level). The donor density is the mose crucial parameter to determine the Mott-Schottky curve of the electric field (Fig. 5 a) are applied to investigate the carriers density of the photocatalyst, according to Eq (1): [51] (1) N D = - 2 eÎµ Îµ 0 d ( 1 / C 2 ) dE -1 e is the unit charge value, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative permittivity of the BS (ε = 45F m−1), C represents the space charges capacitance of the semiconductor, N D is the donor density, and E is the electrode potential, respectively. It can be seen from Table S2, CZS/BS-1.5 donor density is 3.7 times that of CZS/BS, and this enhanced carrier density can be attributed to the presence of S vacancies. Compared with CZS/BS, the negative shift of the flat-band potential of the CZS/BS-1.5 sample is probably caused by the S vacancies in BS. To further probe the charges separation effects, the Debye lengths (L D) of CZS/BS and CZS/BS-1.5 samples are calculated according to the formula:[52] (2) L D = Îµ 0 Îµ r K B T 2 e 2 N D 1 /2 k B represent Boltzmann constant and T express absolute temperature. L D classified as Debye length and ε r is dielectric constant, respectively. According to the Schottky barrier model, the transition time across the depletion layer is linear to the square of L D. From Table S2, the as-prepared CZS/BS-1.5 sample exhibits shorter L D, thereby shorten the transit time is conducive to electron-hole pairs separation. In addition, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution activities of CZS, CZS/BS and CZS/BS-X are studied by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). As shown in Fig. 5b, CZS/BS-1.5 has a lower overpotential than CZS/BS even at high pressure, indicating that CZS/BS-1.5 photocatalyst can significantly reduce hydrogen overpotential and improve the efficiency of carriers separation [53]."
12,Photocatalytic performance,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance As shown in Fig. 6 a, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm CZS/BS can be categorized as type IV isotherm. In the domain of P/P 0 about 0.8–1.0, the isotherm reveal strait hysteresis loop, indicating that there are puffy and accumulational porosity. In additions, CZS/BS-1.5 has a high specific surface area (33.7 m2·g−1), demonstration that it has certain effect on photocatalytic activity. According to Fig. 6b, the photocatalytic activity of different samples is explored. It shows that with the increase of the amount of thiourea, S vacancies are generated. The separation efficiency of CZS/BS-1.5 electrons and holes are significantly enhanced, and hydrogen production rate can reach 16.3 mmol·h−1·g−1. The hydrogen production efficiency of CZS/BS is also improved compared with CZS, which is attributed to the heterojunction structure is beneficial to promote the separation of charges. The hydrogen production efficiency of CZS/BS-2 is improved compared with CZS/BS, which is attributed to the adsorption of large amount of S2- as the active centers on CZS surface. Therefore, there are more active centers to effectively promote the production of hydrogen. Meanwhile, the hydrogen production rate of BS is 0.21 mmol·h−1·g−1 (Fig. S6). Compared with the previous reports, CZS/BS-1.5 exhibits the excellent hydrogen production efficiency (Table S3). The concentration of sacrificial agent (Na2S and Na2SO3) will also affect the photocatalytic activity. It is rather remarkable that the hydrogen evolution rate reaches the maximum when the concentration of Na2S-Na2SO3 mixture is 1.0 M (Fig. 6c). The introduction of S vacancies brings the carriers concentration up to 1017 ~ 1023 cm−3, and causes the generation of LSPR in BS, which accelerated CZS/BS-1.5 hydrogen production rate and effectively separated CZS electrons and holes. The photocatalytic stability of CZS/BS-1.5 is obtained by repeating the experiment for four times (Fig. 6d). In these cycles, the continuous precipitation of hydrogen has no obvious attenuation, indicating that CZS/BS-1.5 is a stable photocatalyst. Meanwhile, the stability of CZS/BS-1.5 before and after photocatalysis are tested by SEM and hydration ion radius. The SEM image shows that CZS/BS-1.5 has basically the same morphology as before photocatalysis, and the size change of hydration ion radius detection is not obvious (Fig. S7, S8). At the same time, the EPR of CZS/BS-1.5 photocatalyst after reaction was detected, and the characteristic peak appeared at g = 2.007 (Fig. S9). The content of Cd2+ and Zn2+ in CZS and CZS/BS-1.5 was detected by ICP after photocatalytic reaction, which confirmed that the combination of BS was beneficial to inhibit the photocatalytic corrosion of CZS (Fig. S10). The above shows that CZS/BS-1.5 has good stability. Fig. 7 a shows the functional relationship between the hydrogen production rate and the Xe lamp power density. When the laser power density increased to 330 mW/cm2, the hydrogen evolution rate reached 16.3 mmol·h−1·g−1, the hydrogen evolution rate is 8.14 mmol·h−1·g−1 at 150 mW/cm2, indicating that there is certain relationship between the hydrogen production rate and the Xe lamp power density. In order to evaluate the light utilization efficiency of the photocatalyst, the wavelength dependent apparent quantum yield (AQY, Fig. 7b) of CZS/BS-1.5 is calculated as the formula [54,55]: (3) AQY = N e N p × 100 % = 2 × M × N A × h × c S × P × t × λ N e is defined as the quantity of reflex electrons, N p as the incident photons, N A is Avogadro constant, M is called the volume of H2 numerators, c is the light velocity, h is the Planck constant, P is the radiant intensity, S is the irradiation area, t is the photoreaction time, simultaneously, λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light. CZS/BS-1.5 has the highest activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production with apparent quantum yield (AQY) up to 19.6%, this is due to accelerated charges separation and carriers migration rate. In order to certify the significance of LSPR caused by S vacancies in promoting the transfer of electrons and holes separation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are proceed in the dark. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the CZS/BS sample is compared with CZS/BS-X, CZS/BS-1.5 in the lower frequency district shows that it has preferable conductivity. In addition, this conclusion confirm that the LSPR caused by S vacancies leads to a lower charges recombination rate in CZS/BS-1.5 and a faster electrons transfer speed. At the same time, according to the transient photocurrent response, the carrier separation efficiencies (ηbulk) can be calculated as 9.4%, 17.6%, 27.1% and 21.3%, respectively (Fig. S11). Moreover, the transient photocurrent responses under visible light are shown in Fig. 8b, it can be surveyed that the photocurrent is rocket with the Xe lamp is turned on, explaining the creation of electrons and holes. And on account of the recombination of electrons and holes when the light is removed, the value quickly drops to zero. The maximum photocurrent also indicates the quickest carriers transfer behavior of CZS/BS-1.5."
13,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism In order to further explore the charge migration between CZS and BS containing S vacancies, the work functions of CZS and BS containing S vacancies are calculated. The work functions of CZS surface and BS containing S vacancies surface are calculated to be 5.63 eV and 4.53 eV (Fig. 9 a and b), respectively. The difference in work function indicates that there is charge transfer at the interface between CZS and BS containing S vacancies. The greater work function of CZS will cause the charge to be transferred from BS containing S vacancies to CZS until the Fermi level counterpoise. After reaching the Fermi equilibrium, the CZS/BS containing S vacancies interface is charged to form an internal electric field, which accelerates the carriers migration between CZS and BS containing S vacancies. In addition, the formation of an internal electric field could greatly accelerate the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes. Simultaneously, compared with traditional BS, the containing S vacancies has lower surface work function (Fig. 9b and c), thence it has weaker electron binding ability and more obvious surface energy band bending. It is more conducive to accelerating photogenerated charge transfer and promoting surface reactions. Fig. 10 explains the LSPR mechanism of BS, on account of S vacancies, there are a large number of free electrons outside and inside the BS. These electrons interact to form an electron gas mass called plasma. In the absence of light, these electrons become electrically neutral. After being excited by light, the external electric field changes periodically with time. The surface plasmon of BS nanoparticles will change with the change of electric field. And that producing LSPR on the surface of BS nanoparticles. In the CZS/BS nanostructure containing S vacancies, schottky barriers are constructed at the interface between CZS and BS. Since the excitation of LSPR, the photogenerated electrons on the surface of plasma BS are promoted to a higher energy condition, which is known as hot electrons. These hot electrons can conquer the energy barrier between CZS and BS, and then immediately transfer to CB of CZS. This plasma effect may arouse more photogenerated electrons on CB of semiconductor to react with H2O to generate more hydrogen. At the same time, it means that the internal electric field is zero, the surface electric field is perpendicular to the surface of the semiconductor, and the semiconductor is in static equilibrium. Each charged particle has an electric field around it, and when the electric field is shielded by the surrounding electric field, it becomes neutral in space. This phenomenon indicates Debye shielding, and the space occupied by the particle field is L D."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, BS with S vacancies have synthesized by adjusting the S source content to make the carriers concentration between 1017 ~ 1023 cm−3, so that BS has a LSPR similar to precious metals. LSPR significantly increased the hydrogen production efficiency of CZS/BS-1.5 nanocomposite to 16.3 mmol·h−1·g−1, which is 2.3 times and 5.6 times of CZS and BS. Photochemical analysis shows that the unique LSPR enables the carriers to separate and transfer effectively in the process of H2O decomposition by photocatalysis."
