0,Introduction,"Novel, efficient and environmentally friendly energy conversion concepts are required for a progressive society trying to transit from fossil fuel energy dependent towards one relying on renewable sources. Renewable hydrogen production could meet such demandnot only because hydrogen is the most abundant element on earth but also widely regarded as an efficient energy carrier with clean burning features. With the foreseeable spread of fuel cell technology, more emphasis should be development of hydrogen production technology [1]. With solar-light offering an essentially inexhaustible source of energy and in the favor of reducing auxiliary components for hydrogen production process, it is possible to believe that photochemical method has a great research potential [2]. Nevertheless, even in spite of many efforts, the conversion efficiency achieved in photocatalytic water splitting is still too low to achieve a satisfactory result [3]. An alternative approach is photoreforming of aqueous solutions containing oxygenated organic compounds. Such photoreforming process is less endergonic which could minimize the back-reaction with oxygen [4]. Interestingly, the mentioned oxygenated organic compounds can be sustainably produced from largely available biomass. The application of biomass offers a sustainable alternative to petrochemical feedstock, and could be convenient in turning waste from a variety of economic sectors into energy resources. As reported, photoreforming processes require photocatalytic materials to generate holes for oxidizing biomass substrate then reduce aqueous protons to hydrogen using the resultant electrons [5]. In most studies, the photocatalytic materials usually refer to a variety of semiconductor materials. As known, TiO2 is one of the most popular candidates used in heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen production since its band gap energy sufficiently low to allow solar excitation as well as its low cost [6]. In general, the concept of photoreforming reaction could be expressed as: (1) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O → photocatalyst hv ≥ E bg nCO 2 + ( 2n + m/ 2 − k ) H 2 Driven by the sunlight, such routes enable the conversion intrinsically renewable resources into hydrogen through the combination of photo-activated oxygenated organic compounds oxidation and water splitting. Compared to water splitting, the proposed photoreforming process offers a more viable route for hydrogen production due to its less endergonic and minimizing the back-reaction with oxygen. Except for photocatalyst materials, the thermodynamics and kinetics involving in such photocatalytic hydrogen production process strongly depend on the energy level of oxidized state/reduce state of biomass organic species [7]. Although the bio-oil is a feasible feedst, hydrogen can only be produced from the aqueous fraction of bio-oil by aqueous phase processing and the hydrogen selectivity was still at a low level [8]. For many biomass-derived liquid substrates with various classes of organic compounds for hydrogen production, different molecule sizes and polarities could be identified. Actually, addition of water to biomass-derived oil would result in a phase separation with the larger and less polar, less polar molecules forming a very viscous bottom fraction, while the more polar compounds migrate to the top aqueous phase [9]. In thermochemical method, such difference in polarity does not affect much for the catalytic conversion of the biomass in the gaseous state. For photochemical studies, the addition of surfactants to liquid phase is the most commonly method used as an effective way to form liquid emulsions. However, the application of surfactants and surface-active polymers are discouraged, because their removal after reaction requires complex steps or there would be a high probability of causing secondary pollution for direct discharge. Although the biomass-derived alcohols being considered as a potential feedstock for hydrogen production, limited information is available in open literature on photocatalytic hydrogen production of water-insoluble biomass alcohols. Bio-octanol as an alcoholic functionality derived from bio-based feedstocks has been studied for many energy related fields, especially hydrogen production. But most of the proposed researches for hydrogen production is limited to biological or thermochemical methods [10–12]. As a long-chain alcohol (LCA) that is not miscible with water, bio-octanol, also other biomass non-water-soluble alcohols, used in photocatalytic hydrogen production is greatly limited compared to the short-chain alcohols (SCAs) [13]. There are two concepts emerging to achieve heterogeneous photocatalysis of immiscible reagents: one is phase-boundary catalysis which is realized by the surface-active solid particles locating at the boundary between aqueous and oil phases, without the formation of Pickering emulsions; the other is Pickering interfacial catalysis which is attributed to the self-assembly catalyst particles stay at the oil-water interface as emulsifiers, the formed rigid film surrounding the droplets could serve as a mechanical barrier against fusion minimizing the interfacial energy [14]. The Pickering emulsion is usually stabilized by amphiphilic solid particles (Janus particles) between the water and oil phase, forming numerous oil/water microdroplets. Janus-type particle imparts drastically different chemical or physical asymmetry properties and directionality within a single particle, and could be self-assembled on the oil-water interface due to this special nature [15]. This method could enlarge the interface area of water and oil significantly and the formed huge interface could help speeding up mass transfer and enhancing reaction kinetics [16]. Zhou et al. studied stable oil/oil Pickering emulsions for fast and efficient acetalization of immiscible long-chain fatty aldehydes with ethylene glycol using Janus-type silica nanoparticles and they achieved such interfacial catalysts for biphasic reactions without the use of solvents [17]. Pera-Titus et al. claimed that Pickering interfacial catalysis for biphasic systems could meet the requirements of green chemistry, such as: minimize or avoid of the amount of by-products and waste or solvents; and use of selective catalysts [18]. Although Pickering interfacial catalysis method has been studied in fine chemical synthesis, depollution and biofuel production etc. Rarely published research could be found for photocatalytic hydrogen production using Pickering interfacial catalysis method so far. The present work was commenced to explore the understanding of Pickering interfacial photoreforming catalysis of bio-octanol and water for hydrogen production. By fabricating amphiphilic TiO2 particles grafted by 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate as an attempt to achieve simultaneously self-assembly at the water/n-octanol interface, it was such particles can promote the formation of stable emulsion. As a result, the photoreforming process performed a better hydrogen production than that of pure water splitting. And photoreforming hydrogen production process was enhanced by microemulsion interfacial catalysis implemented by the synthesized amphiphilic catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of spherical TiO2 catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of spherical TiO2 catalyst All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, Shanghai, China). The deionized water used in the experiments was obtained from Millipore Milli-Q ultrapure water purification systems with a resistivity larger than 18.2 mΩ. In this work, typical spherical TiO2 particles were firstly prepared according to the method previously reported [19]. The preparation process could be described as 4.3 g titanium disulfate was dissolved in 75 ml deionized water with continuously stirring at room temperature. This aqueous solution was then mixed with 75 ml n-propanol. To stabilize dispersion polymerization and avoid particle aggregation, 1 g hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) was added as a steric dispersant. After 12 h of stirring, the obtained solution were kept at 80 °C for aging. The precipitate was separated from the suspension after being centrifuged for 30 min, then washed with distilled water and n-propanol. Finally, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h and then calcined at 600 °C for 2 h."
3,Surface modification of TiO2 particles,"2.2 Surface modification of TiO2 particles It has been reported that the ability to stabilize Pickering emulsion depends on the surface chemistry of emulsifier particles [20,21]. Accordingly, the key factor to tune the oil-water interfacial stability is to regulate the wettability of TiO2 surface in a wide range. Surface modification was found to be an effectivemethod to adjust the surface wettability of particles [22]. According to the preparation method of TiO2 [19], the used bare TiO2 possessed hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on the particle surface and the density difference of this group on the surface caused amphiphilic nature of TiO2. However, such surface nature had weak hydrophilic-lipophilic properties which was not sufficient to realize stable Pickering emulsification of bio-octanol and water. Therefore, a novel surface modification by a Pickering emulsion approach was proposed to enhance the amphiphilic property of TiO2 by using oil and water phases with very different polarities. The modification process of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (C10H20O5Si, a silane coupling agent) on the TiO2 surface was illustrated in Fig. 1 . In this process, Pickering emulsions were firstly formed as the oil added dropwise with high stirring. After hydrolysis of the silane coupling agent, the silanol combined with surface hydroxyl group of TiO2 particles in the form of hydrogen bonds. In order to prepare Janus-type particles, the amphiphilic surface modification need to be implemented with the prepared TiO2 sphere. Firstly, a suspension of 1 wt% TiO2 spheres in 50 ml distilled water was adjusted the pH to 3 with 1M NaOH or HCl for achieving lipophilic side modification [22]. After centrifugation at 13000 rpm (IKA T18 Ultra Turrax, Co. Ltd. Germany), 10 ml toluene solution containing 1 × 10−4 mol/l of silane coupling agent was added dropwise to the suspension. The obtained emulsion was stirred for 20min and subsequently aged for over 24 h. After that, the spheres were separated from solvent by centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and water alternatively for at least 3 cycles to remove excessive reagent. And then, the modified particles were dried in an vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 °C. The modified TiO2 particles are referred as Janus-type TiO2."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods The specific area of the sample was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using a N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 °C measured with Micrometric Acusorb 2100E apparatus. A typical experiment was conducted to a relative pressure, P/P0 < 0.3 at-196 °C, where P0 is the saturation pressure. Samples (approximately 80 mg) were degassed prior to the measurement at 100 °C for 1 h and then at 120 °C for 2 h. The pore size distributions were calculated in accordance with the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on Shimadzu XRD-6000 powder diffractometer (at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu Kα-ray, with λ = 0.1541 nm). A nominal step interval of 0.0025° 2θ with a step time of 100s in continuous mode was routinely applied. The Scherrer equation was used to calculate the mean crystallite size based on the diffraction peaks. The particle size of the sample was determined at 25 °C by dynamic light scattering (DLS) at a scattering angle of 173° with a Zeta sizer Nano ZS particle size analyzer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., England). A field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, LEO 1530) was used to study the surface morphology of samples. The detailed morphology and structure of the catalyst was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) using JEOL-2100 operated at 20 kV and the Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of particle surface was carried out on a XFlash 5030 detector. For a typical HRTEM analysis, the samples were ground and dispersed with ethanol, and deposited on a Cu grid covered with a perforated carbon membrane prior to the test. FT-IR spectra was recorded for the synthesized sample in air at room temperature on a Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700). The grafting efficiency and thermal behavior of modified TiO2 particles were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a Stanton-Redcroft thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C/min with a dwell time of 10 min. UV–vis diffused reflectance spectra of the samples was recorded by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan). The photoelectrochemical behavior of the samples were examined by Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) carried out under ambient conditions without light irradiation. The LSV experiments were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI600E) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 over the potential range of 0 to −0.8 V bias (vs Ag/AgCl) with a standard three-electrode configuration including a platinum wire as the counter electrode, standard Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and Na2SO4 (0.5M) aqueous solution as the electrolyte at room temperature. The system was continuously purged with N2 for moving O2 before test. The suspension of catalyst-Nafion-ethanol was spread on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductor glass which was served as working electrode. An optical microscopy equipped with a digital camera was installed under an inverted optical microscope (BDS400, Optex Co. Ltd., China) for observing surface topography of the formed emulsion."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were performed in a duplex Pyrex flask at ambient temperature and −0.1 MPaG pressure. The photocatalytic reaction was triggered using a light source system (320–780 nm, Philae technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China), which was positioned 10 cm away from the reactor in the vertical direction. The focused intensity and areas on the flask for xenon lamp were ca. 350 mW/cm2 and 0.28 cm2, respectively. In interfacial photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment, 0.1 g TiO2 catalyst/emulsifier sample was suspended in 100 ml of a mixed solution of 10 ml biomassderived n-octanol and 90 ml deionized water under ultrasonic to form emulsion. In the comparison experiment, the solution mixture was replaced with 100 ml deionized water. As the photocatalytic reaction system was directly connected to the GC, the prouduct gases were instantly pumped into the gas pathways of the online gas chromatograph system (GC-2014c AT, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, and nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of synthesized Janus-type TiO2 spheres,"3.1 Characterization of synthesized Janus-type TiO2 spheres Phase structures of the synthesized photocatalyst samples were investigated by XRD method. To determine the effect for calcination for the TiO2 crystallinity, diffraction patterns of the sample before (the sample was only dried under 25 °C for 24 h) and after calcinations were displayed (Fig. 2 ). It was found that the fine and sharp peaks of anatase TiO2 at 25.3°, 38.9°, 48.2°, 54.0°, 55.2°, 62.9°, 69.0°, 70.4° and 74.3° corresponding to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215) and (301) crystal planes of anatase TiO2, and this fact indicated the precursor particles were amorphous and completely transformed into anatase phase after calcined at 600 °C for 2 h. The average crystal size of particle was estimating from the widths of anatase (101) reflection obtained from the XRD results by the Scherrer formula [23], and the results were listed in Table 1 . In our previous study, such small size anatase TiO2 was found to be active for photoreforming hydrogen production [24]. Therefore, high temperature calcinations should be considered for TiO2 synthesis. In order to explore the particle size distribution of synthesized TiO2 spheres and their dispersion stabilities in aqueous phase, SEM and DLS analysis were implemented. As shown in Fig. 3 , the as-prepared TiO2 particles before and after surface modification displayed nearly spherical shapes with the average diameter of ca. 1.8 μm. From the FESEM results of the particle size analyzed by software Nano Measurer 1.2.0, one could found that there was slight difference of the detected average diameters in gaseous (FESEM) and aqueous environment (DLS) revealing aggregations. In fact, the performed surface modification had little effect on the dispersion stability of TiO2 sphere under such diameter scale. To further determine the detailed morphology and structure of the particles, the TiO2 samples were examined by TEM method. Fig. 4 clearly showed the round microsphere with a diameter of around 2 μm. The measured lattice fringes of 3.5 Å could be identified as the (101) anatase which confirmed the XRD results after high temperature calcination. These results clearly demonstrate organosilanes modification on the surface of TiO2 would not significantly affect the morphology and diameter of the particles. Furthermore, the EDX spectrum showed the presence of Si and C elements, which gave strong evidence for presence of the organic silanol on the surface of TiO2. The porous structure of TiO2 was investigated by N2 sorption analysis. The BET results and detailed pore parameters were summarized in Table 1. In Fig. 5 , the TiO2 samples before and after surface modification all showed typical IV type of sorption isotherms. The results evidenced the surface modification would not change the type of porous structure but decrease the specific surface area, average pore size and pore volume. This was probably because of the coverage of organic groups on the pore of TiO2 particles. The FTIR spectra of the bare and Janus-type TiO2 particles were depicted in Fig. 6 . From the observation of the two sets of spectra, the peaks below 700 cm−1 could be assigned to Ti-O and Ti-O-Ti bonding of titania [25]. The stretching vibration of absorbed water as well as surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 particles were confirmed by the extensive bands between 3400 and 3100 cm−1 and the low intensity peak at 1640 cm−1 [26]. Concerning the Janus-type TiO2, the spectra of the employed silane coupling agent involves characteristic bands of its functional groups such as the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibration of C-H bond in methylene group were observed at 2930 and 2870 cm−1 [27], C-H stretching vibration was observed at 1456 and 1398 cm−1 [28,29], the CO stretching vibration at 1713 cm−1 and C-O absorption bands at 1176 cm−1 were also identified [30,31]. The Si-O-Si band observed at around 1042 cm−1 indicated the occurrence of the condensation reaction between silanol groups. The peak in the region between 910 and 960 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration band of Ti-O-Si clarified the successful grafting of functional groups of silane coupling agents to the surface of TiO2 particles illustrated in Fig. 1 [32], since the residual and physical absorbed 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate molecules had been already removed before test. Based on the thermal response differences of TiO2 and silane coupling agent on its surface, thermal gravimetric analysis were performed in order to estimate the grafted amount of silane coupling agent. After preheated to 100 °C, the temperature was then raised to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air atmosphere. Fig. 7 showed the TGA and DTG curves for bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2. As can be seen, the bare TiO2 were relatively stable evidenced by the weight loss within ca. 2%. The slight weight loss around 100–170 °C could be assigned to limited amount of physically absorbed water at the surface of TiO2. From 200 to 450 °C, the weight loss was mainly due to the condensation of surface hydroxyl groups. There was no obvious DTG peak for bare TiO2 sample during the test demonstrated the weight loss rate and the composition were stable. However, a higher weight loss was observed for Janus-type TiO2 sample because of weight loss of the hydroxyl groups in grafted silanol at TiO2 surface in the temperature region of 200–450 °C. Moreover, it can be seen from DTG curve of Janus-type TiO2 that the increase of high weight loss rate began near 300 °C, and reached its maximum value at around 400 °C, which could be attributed to a large-scale oxidative thermal decomposition of organosilanechains [33,34]. Fig. 8 (a) showed a comparison results of UV–Vis absorbance spectra of bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2. As observed from the curves, there was a significant increase in the light absorption at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm which could be assigned to the band gap absorption of anatase TiO2 for both samples. Furthermore, the Kubelka-Munk diagram obtained from the data of UV–vis absorbance spectra was presented in Fig. 8 (b). For bare TiO2, the band gap was estimated to be 3.16 eV while the value of Janus-type TiO2 was 3.17 eV. These results indicated that surface modification had no obvious effect on the apparent band gap of synthesized TiO2 particle. To investigate the effect of amphiphilic surface modification on electrochemical properties of TiO2, the electrochemical measurements of the samples were carried out in a standard three-electrode configuration. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the samples were plotted at the range of 0 to −0.8 V bias potential (vs Ag/AgCl) in Fig. 9 . As shown, the synthesized Janus-type TiO2 slightly increased the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction due to the decrease surface active sites after surface modification indicating less catalytic activity for H2 production compared to bare TiO2. The Tafel plots of overpotential versus log(current density) were also illustrated based on the results of LSV using the Tafel equation (η = a+b·log(j), where η is overpotential, j is the current density, and b is the Tafel slope). The obtained result could further confirm the effect for the amphiphilic surface modification of TiO2, also the Tafel slope could give additional insight into hydrogen production mechanisms on the prepared TiO2. As shown in Fig. 9, the bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2 exhibited a Tafel slopes of ∼166 mV/dec and ∼222 mV/dec, respectively and these values could reflect the rate-determining step of electrochemical hydrogen evolution properties of the synthesized sample [35]. From the comparison of the Tafel slope values, one can observe the Janus-type TiO2 was less active for the H2 evolution than that of bare TiO2, which could be possibly due to the weak bond strength of adsorbed hydrogen and severe coverage of intermediates leaded by the amphiphlic surface modification."
8,Emulsification performance of the Janus-type TiO2,"3.2 Emulsification performance of the Janus-type TiO2 The wettability degree of liquid on the solid is dependent on the interfacial tensions, and that could be reflected by the contact angle (θ) of a liquid-vapor interface meets a solid surface. The results of the water droplet contact angle were given in Fig. 10 . As shown, the water contact angle of the synthesized bare TiO2 was 27.4° indicating good hydrophilicity, and the water contact angle of the surface modified TiO2 was 106.9° indicating good hydrophobicity. Therefore, it could be concluded that the synthesized TiO2 could possess hydrophobic properties after surface modification. For the purpose of examine emulsifying properties of bare and modified TiO2 particles, 2 ml bio-octanol was added into 18 ml water with 1 wt% of bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2 respectively added as emulsifier. After vigorous stirring for a few minutes, the bare TiO2 was completely suspended in the lower water layer shown in the insert legend of Fig. 11 and no emulsion was generated under optical microscopic observation. On the other hand, the Janus-type TiO2 was mostly distributed in the upper octanol layer, where Pickering emulsion was formed. The emulsion droplets were observed with optical microscope. Since the contact angles of the particles and initial concentrations of each components in the solution were known, the formed emulsion could be determined as oil-in-water emulsion [36]. The significant change in the emulsion can be interpreted by the wettability of particles, yet the bare TiO2 particles were too hydrophilic to stabilize Pickering emulsion. The Janus-type TiO2 particles were able to serve as solid emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsion with their amphiphilic properties [37]. To further examine the self-assembly ability of these particles, a variety of Janus-type TiO2 concentrations was attempted to observe the change in droplet sizes. As plotted in Fig. 11, with the increasing amount of particles from 0.2 to 1.0 wt%, the emulsion droplet size gradually decreased from 2395.7 to 252.3 μm. To be noted, only a slight change occurred for further increasing the amount of particles with a fixed octanol-water dosage and the results were not shown. This result was similar to the behavior of other type of solid emulsifier previously reported [38]. The phenomenon could be considered that more and more interface surface area was needed to be occupied by the increasing particles and the amount of raw materials was determined, these facts led to the decrease of emulsion droplet size [39]."
9,Photocatalytic H2 production at emulsion interface,"3.3 Photocatalytic H2 production at emulsion interface Except for emulsifier, the synthesized Janus-type TiO2 particles could also be applied as photocatalyst. In order to examine the catalytic activity at emulsion interface, an organic/water (bio-octanol/water) biphasic system was established for hydrogen production reaction. Firstly, the blank tests were carried out, and no obvious H2 can be produced without light or photocatalyst. The results of H2 production and the reaction rate under the light over bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2 in pure water and octanol-water reaction system were shown in Fig. 12 . The amount of the produced H2 was increased with the increasing irradiation time in all cases as expected. In the pure water system, both bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2 exhibited low activity for photocatalytic H2 production, and this could be attributed to rapid electron-hole recombination of TiO2 material. And the Janus-type TiO2 showed lower photocatalytic activity, which could be due to the decrease of active sites after the surface modification with certain grafting efficiency. In the case of biphasic reaction system, the addition of bio-octanol could improve the H2 evolution amount and reaction rate significantly for both bare TiO2 and Janus-type TiO2 indicating the promotion of photoreforming reaction. Actually, bio-octanol as in photocatalytic H2 production system could be serve as electron donor, which would combine with photogenerated hole of TiO2 and restrain the recombination of electron hole pair [13]. Especially, compared with bare TiO2, the Janus-type TiO2 exhibited much higher catalytic activity. The bare TiO2 particles were almost all distributed in water phase, so that the limited bio-octanol could be involved in the photoreforming hydrogen production reaction. Unlike bare TiO2, the Janus-type TiO2 could stabilize the emulsion droplets to increase oil-water interface surface area for enhancing the exchange of reaction substance, therefore increased the utilization of bio-octanol. This method might promote photocatalytic hydrogen production or degradation of other LCAs, which could somehow overcome its poor adsorption on photocatalysts. As seen in Fig. 13 , the H2 evolution rate increased with the increasing concentration of Janus-type TiO2 and the increment gradually decreased with the increasing of concentration implying an optimal ratio could be obtained eventually. This results could be associated with the curves shown in Fig. 11 meaning the concentration of TiO2 had a great effect on the droplets size, which was related to the amount of H2 production. Fig. 14 presented the H2 evolution amount in various water to bio-octanol ratio. Within the irradiation duration of 6 h, all the curves displayed growth tendencies. With the increasing ratio of water to bio-octanol, the H2 evolution amount increased at first and decreased subsequently in the selected range. From the results, the H2 production performance reached its maximum level at the ratio of 8:2. This obtained ratio would most likely be determined by the stoichiometric numbers on the possible reaction pathways and also influenced by the mass transfer efficiency correlated to the adsorption properties of catalyst and emulsion stabilization. The cyclic performance of the interfacial photocatalysis in Pickering emulsion system was further evaluated under the known optimal conditions. In this process, 0.2 g Janus-type TiO2 was suspended in the mixture of 20 ml bio-octanol and 80 ml water. After 6 h of each catalytic reaction, all instruments included the lighting were turned off for 12 h for the substrates to re-oxidize the catalyst. Fig. 15 listed the 15 reaction-recovery cycles with each cycle denoted as an accumulative H2 production amounts. In the second reaction cycle, the amount of H2 production decreased significantly from 342.16 μmol/g to 288.44 μmol/g. As the reaction cycle carried on, the H2 evolution continuously decreased and tend to keep stable after the third cycle. The decay might partially caused by the catalyst inactivation since the similar catalyst has been previously studied that its catalytic activity decayed after three cycles [6]. It was found that the emulsion droplets would decrease as the number of cycles increased under the observation of the microscope (shown in the insert images of Fig. 15) which might also be one of the reasons for the decrease in hydrogen production as the number of cycles increased. The relative stability in the later stage of the cyclic test may be due to a certain dynamic balance between the catalyst activity and the stability of the emulsion. To further investigate the cyclic performance, re-emulsion process was proceeded by re-stirring the emulsion after the 10th cyclic test. From the result, one can observe that the emulsion droplet damage became more and more serious as the number of cycles increases. Therefore, the stability of both emulsion and catalytic activity are the main factor for the H2 production decline. The stability of Pickering emulsion depends on many factors. Such as tunable wettability and Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance number (HLB), which could be controlled by the method and degree of surface modification. The emulsion could also be easily damaged by the generated gaseous products in the interfacial reaction. As the liquid being gradually consumed when the reaction proceeded, the relative size and quality of the particle to the emulsion droplet would getting larger bigger. Once this process developed to a critical extent, the emulsion would eventually disappear according to the result in Fig. 11. Therefore, the weight ratio and particle size of the catalyst should be in consideration when investigating the interfacial catalytic hydrogen production."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, an effective approach was demonstrated to realize interfacial photoreforming H2 production from bio-oil based organic substrate and water. An amphiphlic Janus-type TiO2 anatase was successfully synthesized through a selective modification method. The synthesized Janus-type TiO2, which was served as a solid emulsifier to stabilize Pickering emulsion with its self-assembly properties at the oil-water interface, exhibited excellent catalytic activity in Pickering interfacial reaction and the corresponding cyclic performance. Compared to oil-water biphasic interfacial catalytic hydrogen production, a higher yield of hydrogen production was obtained at oil-in-water Pickering emulsion interfacial catalysis due to the excellent emulsification property of Janus-type TiO2 catalysts providing a high accessibility for the reactants. Although the amphiphlic surface modification reduced photocatalytic activity to some extent by sacrificing the surface active sites, the amount of hydrogen generation from Pickering interfacial catalytic system was still larger than that of the conventional biphasic system. The cyclic hydrogen production performance was found to be influenced by both emulsification property and TiO2 catalytic nature. This conception of Pickering emulsion interfacial catalysis using Janus-type catalyst would inspire the field of hydrogen production from biphasic system, and the choice of substrates for photoreforming hydrogen production could be further extended."
