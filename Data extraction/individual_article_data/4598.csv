0,Introduction,"Electrospinning offers unique capabilities for fabrication of novel nanofibers with diameters ranging from nanometers to micrometers, controllable surface morphology and, a superior mechanical performance by applying electrical forces to natural or synthetic polymers solutions [1,2]. Electrospinning process is based on fundamental principle calls “electrostatic interaction”, under high voltage, a polymer solution is controlled via syringe pump, and needle behaves like an electrode to charge the solution and spun it to conductive metal collector surface [3]. Many parameters in terms of solution properties (surface tension, viscosity, conductivity, etc.), electrospinning set up parameters (intensity of electric field, distance between nozzle and collector surface, polymer flow rate, etc.) and ambient conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) affects morphology, tunable diameter and chemical composition of obtaining nanofibers [4]. Compared with another known form of the materials; nanofibers- ultra-fine, flexible, high strength/toughness, good thermal and electrical conductivity, bio/compliant properties- are candidates for many critical applications such as energy engineering (fuel cell, catalyst, etc.), tissue engineering-scaffolding (membrane for skin, blood vessel, nerve generations, etc.), life sciences applications (drug delivery, haemostatic devices, etc.), military protective clothing, nano-sensors (piezoelectric sensor, thermal sensor, etc.) [2]. The global environmental pollution and energy demand problems force to research and commercial fields to effort developing the many new types of clean energy materials like catalyst, storage mediums, electrode membranes, separators, collectors, super-capacitors, etc. and storage devices such as solar and fuel cells, lithium and sodium ion batteries, etc. [5]. To provide pollution- and carbon-free power for buildings, transport, and industries, hydrogen as an energy carrier plays a critical role in future energy options. In order to knock-down hydrogen price for practical applications, storage and releasing problems must be solved for the utilization of safe and efficient methods [6]. Last decades, ammonia borane (NH3BH3) identified as hydrogen (H2) reservoir with high energy carrier capacity, especially for jets and rockets applications. For power consumption, hydrolysis is the best methodology to release hydrogen, which chemically deposited in NH3BH3 in the presence of noble and non-noble metals/metal oxides, acids, bases, nano-alloys, and nanocomposites as catalysts as shown in Eq. (1) [7–9]: (1) NH 3 BH 3 ( s ) + 2 H 2 O ( l ) → catalyst NH 4 + ( a q ) + BO 2 - ( a q ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) In particular, to increase the interaction of NH3BH3 with catalysts’s active sites –, a different type of organic and inorganic support materials such as Al2O3, SiO2, carbon, polymers, clays, etc. have been evaluated - [7–9]. Among of them, polymers (PAN, PVA, PMMA, PANi, etc.) have been gain a special interest in the field fabrication of nanofibers, nanorods, and mats types prepared by low cost and efficient electrospinning technique [2,10–14]. The catalysts in the nanofiber structure, especially fabricated by electrospinning, have highly active sites to provide active morphological properties that provide active interaction with the reactant molecules due to their small and interrelated pores. The position of the catalytic active sites in the polymer skeleton and the polymer coating affects the catalyst reactivity [3,15,16]. Based on the increase in performance of the catalyst, investigation on regarding different polymer has been carried out in order to determine which is more effective as a matrix, and photocatalytic activity was tested against the toxicant simulated 2-chloroethylphynilesulfate under ultraviolet light irradiation [17]. Yu and Liu (2007) reported that when Pd/PAN-AA nanofibers were evaluated for their hexane productivity, they exhibited 4.7 times higher activity than Pd/γ-Al2O3, as well as their – reusability properties [18]. Electrospun NiCu nanorods@carbon nanofibers for highly efficient dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 had been synthesized based on electrospinning of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solutions, and introduced fibers showed superficial activity [19]. Pd doped Co nanofibers were prepared by using PVA and tested for hydrolysis of NH3BH3 under sun and daylight. It was concluded that nanofibers could also be explored as a photocatalyst for waste water treatment [20]. Electrospun CdS–TiO2 doped carbon nanofibers were introduced for visible-light-induced photocatalytic hydrolysis of NH3BH3 [21]. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers supported alloyed Pd–Pt nanoparticles as recyclable catalysts tested for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of NH3BH3 and catalysts showed high potential to find applications for the development of hydrogen generation for clean energy [22]. Li et al. (2014) prepared composite nanofibers using cobalt (II) chloride and PAN and found that they exhibited catalytic activity in hydrogen production from sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solutions [23]. Demir et al. (2004) found that Pd/PAN-AA nanofibers were 4.5 times more active in dehydrolinalol hydrogenation than Pd/Al2O3 catalysts [24]. Coşkuner Filiz and Kantürk Figen (2016) prepared Co, Ni, Cu metal oxide nanofibers from PVA (5 wt%)/metal acetate composites and they demonstrated that the Co-NF catalyst exhibits higher catalytic efficiency for hydrogen release from NH3BH3 than the Ni- and Cu-based metal oxide-NF catalysts [25]. Parametric investigation of electrospinning parameters is beneficial for improving the electrospinability of polymer solution and quality of the fibers by eliminating of beads and formation of uniform diameter. Based on the above consideration, herein we reported the fabrication and physicochemical characterization of polyacrylonitrile polymeric (PAN/CoAc) and metal oxide (Co3O4/Nfs) nanofibrous structured composite catalysts prepared by electrospinning technique. To best of our knowledge, statistically analyzed spinning parameters of Co-containing PAN solution to obtain smooth, beadles, homogeneous, and porous nanofibrous structures and especially their application in hydrogen production has not been reported before. The obtained fibrous - in the form of nanofibers were catalytically active as a catalyst used for NH3BH3 dehydrogenation with good repeatability during the fast reaction of hydrogen release."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyacrylonitrile (PAN; (C3H3N)n, % 99.995, Sigma-Aldrich, MW = 150000 g/mol), cobalt(II)acetate tetrahydrate (CoAc; (CH3CO2)2Co·4H2O, % 99.8, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethylformamide (DMF; HCON(CH3)2, Merck), ammonia borane (AB; NH3BH3, Sigma-Aldrich, >97%), were purchased and used without any further purification."
3,Preparation and characterization of nanofibrous composites,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of nanofibrous composites CoAc (5 wt%) and PAN (10 wt%) solutions firstly prepared by dissolving in DMF and stirred at 60 °C for 2 h to form a homogeneous solution. The prepared solution was placed in a plastic syringe then subjected to conventional single nozzle electrospinning (Inovenso Co. Ltd., Turkey) at different applied voltages (15 kV and 25 kV) and collection distances (5.0 cm and 7.5 cm) at a constant flow rate 1 ml h−1. The as-spun nanofibrous composites were collected on an aluminum foil and initially dried at room temperature. The half of dried polymeric structure nanofibrous composites were coded as PAN/CoAc and preserved in a desiccator. The other half of polymeric samples were refined and subjected to heat treatment under oxidative atmosphere in controlled temperature program (1 °C min−1 up to 450 °C, waiting 4 h at 450 °C, cooling to room temperature at 1 °C min−1) to remove the organic compounds. The samples were obtained in metal oxide structure coded as Co3O4/Nfs. Detailed electrospinning procedure parameters and codes of samples were listed in Table 1 . Morphology, crystalline, chemical, and thermal properties of nanofibrous structured PAN composites were characterized by several techniques (Figs. 1–4 ). Specifications and test conditions of physicochemical analysis were explained in Table 2 ."
4,Hydrogen evolution test for catalytic activity,"2.3 Hydrogen evolution test for catalytic activity The catalytic activity of introduced polymeric and metal oxide structured nanofibrous composites toward NH3BH3 hydrolysis was evaluated by measuring the evolved hydrogen volume in typical water-filled gas burette system containing a Pyrex reactor with three openings for introducing water, a hydrogen exhaust and a thermocouple. A 10 ml water was added to react with NH3BH3 sample (0.12 M) in the presence of the nanofibrous composites (5 mg) and, a solution was agitated at 750 rpm during the hydrogen production at 60 °C ± 2 °C which is the optimum working temperature for the fuel cell according to the U.S.A. Department of Energy (DOE) criteria. The total volume of dehumidified hydrogen gas was measured against to time and used for calculation of hydrogen generated rate (HGR, l H2 min−1 g catalyst−1) (see Fig. 5 )."
5,Further investigation of most active fibrous composites,"2.4 Further investigation of most active fibrous composites The further characterization of the most active fibrous composite was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and method volumetric surface analyzer using conventional multipoint Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) to get more information about its morphology, adsorption isotherms, and pores (Fig. 6 ). The details of characterizations were given in Table 2. The most active composite’s repeatability against to the NH3BH3 hydrolysis was tested with consequent 8 runs under the same conditions as explain in Section 2.3. In the repeatability test, firstly the fresh catalysts (∼5 mg) added to 0.12 M NH3BH3 aqueous medium and after the hydrogen generation was completed, the same amount of NH3BH3 powder was added into the reactor for starting a new hydrolysis reaction. Repeatability test results were given in Fig. 7 ."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical properties of polymeric nanofibrous composites,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of polymeric nanofibrous composites Processing variables were tested to determine their effect on fiber diameter determined from Fig. 1a-d, for the purpose of this system involving two significant independent variables as applied voltage, and nozzle-target in two alternative levels as 15–25 kV and 5.0–7.5 cm. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was carried out to conclude the significant levels of the factors and p-values was set to <0.05. Analysis results from two Factor ANOVA with replication which shows its degree of freedom (df), a sum of squares (SS), mean of a square (MS), F ratios, and p-values were given in ANOVA table (Table 3 ). ANOVA results indicated that distance (p = 0.0001 < 0.05) had an applied voltage (p = 0.0066 < 0.05) were significant factors that affect the fiber diameter. Moreover this, distance had the lowest p-value compared with the applied voltage which showed more significant effect on fiber diameters. As could be seen in Fig. 2, there was no interaction between the application voltage and the distance due to the parallelism of the straight lines obtained in this experimental results (p = 0.1387 < 0.05). There was no significant interaction between applied voltage and distance: at the high (7.5 cm) and low (5.0 cm) levels of distance, the fiber diameter considerably decreased as the applied voltage went from low (15 kV) to high level (25 kV) that appeared to be almost the same. Fig. 1 represents the SEM images (a–d) and inset plots illustrate the pore morphologies, XRD patterns (e) and FTIR spectrums (f) of corresponding polymeric PAN/CoAc composites. The representative SEM images of PAN/CoAc-1 were clearly showed fibrous morphologies in Fig. 1a. Fibers looked cylindrical with macroporous structure (average 167 nm) and had a quite uniform diameter distribution in the range of 780–960 nm. It was a natural feature of fiber production to obtain scattered distribution in fiber diameter [26]. It was seen that decreasing the tip to collector distance (from 7.5 cm to 5.0 cm) at same applied voltage resulting with larger diameters as can be seen as PAN/CoAc-2 (Fig. 1b). In most cases, optimum tip to collector distance was required for fibers to obtain uniformity as well as thickness. At the minimum distance, beads have been observed due to limited time to dry before the reaching the collector [4]. As can be seen from the Fig. 1b belongs to PAN/CoAc-2, cylindrical fiber still obtained with macroporous (∼250 nm), although thickening at the fiber with a bead (spotted with red circle) has occurred. Some researchers underlined that distance on the fiber morphology was not as significant as important other electrospun setup parameters [27,28]. It was found that by increasing the applied voltage resulted with an increase in the electrostatic force and more polymer injection was led to narrow fiber diameter [27,29]. In our study, fiber diameter was decreased from 3041 nm to 1846 nm, when applied voltage decreased under same distance condition (5 cm). When applied voltage was set up 15 kV to 25 kV for 7.5 cm distance, fiber diameter got thinner roughly almost cut in half (Fig. 1). Thus, voltage influence on fiber diameter was more effective than distance similar to literature reports [30–32]. The correlating these results from the Table 3 and Fig. 2 indicated the fiber diameters decreased with increasing the applied voltage. 10 kV increase in applied voltage results decreasing of diameter 416 nm at 7.5 cm and 1195 nm at 5 cm distance (Fig. 2a). The effect of the distance caused a reduction in fiber diameter and 2.5 cm increase resulted in an average fiber loss of 1335 nm (Fig. 2b). Average fiber diameters were followed to decrease trend with increasing of the nozzle-target distance (Fig. 2c). It was necessary to examine the interaction plots of applied voltage and distance on the fiber diameter. Fig. 1e shows the typical XRD pattern of polymeric PAN/CoAc composites prepared at different parameters by the spinning of PAN-Co acetate solution. During the electrospinning process, the cobalt acetate ions were ejaculated from the nozzle and fully coated by PAN polymer solution. Due to high electrospun frequency, polymer solution jet splinted into multiple branches and extended to the collector surface as it continuously traveled to it. Consequently, cobalt acetate ions were encapsulated into fibrous mats. As shown in this figure, all as-spun fibrous composites had the same crystalline structure. The peaks at 2θ ∼ 7.423°, 8.495°, and 11.292° matched well with the lattice spacing of 11.90 Å, 10.40 Å and 7.83 Å of cobalt acetate hydroxide, respectively. According to the JCPDS database, the peaks indicated consist of cobalt acetate hydroxide with the hexagonal structure (00-022-0582 JCPDS) in C10H16Co3O11 chemical formula. Moreover, there were other peaks detected between 10° and 20° corresponding to the PAN matrix that almost the same as in the previous report [28]. The combination with PAN did not influence the crystal structure of the host cobalt acetate material. It was noteworthy that the electrospinning process performed under various applied voltage and working distance has no influence on the crystalline structure of obtained polymeric fibrous composites. Fig. 1f shows the ATR/FT-IR spectra of neat PAN matrix fibers and polymeric PAN/CoAc nanofibers. All the samples shown similar spectra with characteristics bands assign to CN stretching vibration at around 2243 cm−1 and the absorption at 3600 cm−1-3200 cm−1 region, a result of moisture in samples. The peaks of neat PAN matrix fiber were assigned as 2933 cm−1 CH stretching in CH and CH2 groups, 1666 cm−1 CO stretching, 1452 cm−1 CH blending, 1071 cm−1 CN blending. After the electrospinning of PAN with cobalt acetate under different process parameters, FT-IR spectrums significantly changed. A significant reduction of peaks at 2243 cm−1 for the CN group meant that part of nitrile groups on the surface of the fibers was diluted [29]. Bands at peaks of 1409, 1440, and 1323 cm−1 originated from CH groups demonstrated that acetate groups were successfully introduced into fiber structure. Fig. 3 shows thermal analysis results of polymeric PAN/CoAc nanofibers: TG (a), DTG (b), DSC (c) and DMA (d) curves, also corresponding observation and findings of these curves were listed in detail in Table 4 . Polymeric nanofibers were composed of PAN polymer and cobalt acetate, which degraded at different temperatures and showed similar thermal behaviors. In the present study, to identify and quantify the degradation characteristic of electrospun acetate nanofibers, firstly PAN was subject to electrospinning to obtain neat PAN polymer fiber. When the heat was applied to polymeric materials, both physical and chemical changes were occurred and resulted in volatiles and some residuals. Decomposition reactions could be categorized into two mechanisms involving two sub-mechanism which were useful for the characterization and understanding of decomposition: (i) main chain reactions, (ii) side chain/substituent reactions. Generally, thermoplastics's degradation maintains the main polymer chain into the breaking of bonds. Also cross-linking reactions occur in the main chain which leads to the creation of bonds between two adjacent polymer chains [30]. In addition to this, acetate structure lost its water and dehydration reaction completed about 150 °C and formed into glass-like structure. Subsequently, anhydrous acetate crystallization occurred about 200 °C. The decomposition of acetate structure were identified in two-stage between 275 °C and 310 °C and rock-salt structure obtained after decomposition reaction [31]. It was well-known form the literature polymer composites degrade in several steps. The differences in the temperature were due to the variations in chain length and compositions. Generally, during the second step of the degradation of polymer and additives was occurred. Afterward decomposition of remaining structures took place in the third step. It was not possible to separate the different decomposition steps because the reaction mechanism was very complex. The TG and DTG curves of neat PAN nanofibers showed two reaction zone during thermal degradation, yielding a residual mass of 52.63% as could be seen in Fig. 3a and b. It was clearly observed, there was a big drop (30.05 wt%) took place approximately in the temperature range of 292.17–349.13 °C (Table 4). PAN nanofibers were thermally stable before ∼290 °C. The first zone was associated with nitrile oligomerization resulted with volatile products and the second zone was related with final degradation of the polymer occurred at around 423.04 °C with 17.32% weight loss determined from DTG curve [10,32,33]. Also, this observation matched with previous results of PAN matrix thermal behavior. Ghobadi et al. [14] reported an investigation of TGA analyses of PVA/PAN/r-GO ternary electrospun mats; it was shown that mass loss did not continue until 220 °C and over %95 remaining mass associated with PVA backbone was decomposition. According to the obtained TG and DTG curves of polymeric fibrous composites as shown in Fig. 2a and b, one could claim that considering each sample showed different thermal degradation behavior compared with neat PAN fibers due to the addition of acetate into the polymer matrix. The profile of weight loss of each polymeric composites were exhibited a similar degradation behavior and broken into three steps. The initial step for PAN/CoAc-1, PAN/CoAc-2, PAN/CoAc-3 and PAN/CoAc-4 composites started after 211.31 °C, 213.02 °C, 207.86 °C and 207.00 °C, respectively. Before these temperatures, no degradation reactions occurred, and all composites were thermally stable up to ∼210 °C. For instance, DTG curve for PAN/CoAc-1 sample showed three peaks with maximum peak temperatures (Tm) of 229.63 °C, 267.67 °C and 307.35 °C corresponding weight lost determined form TG curve and detailed results were listed in Table 4. After the first degradation steps, the second degradation started at temperature ranges of 245–253 °C and a mass loss occurred due to degradation of acetate groups in the fiber structure. Further heating up to 500 °C, the main degradation started at temperature ranges of 280–326 °C a significant mass loss occurred due to polymer degradation processes. Residual amount were calculated as 63.88%, 66.20%, 65.83% and 68.86% for PAN/CoAc-1, PAN/CoAc-2, PAN/CoAc-3 and PAN/CoAc-4, respectively. These were remarkably larger than those of the neat PAN nanofibers, related with the presence of an acetate structure in the composition of electrospinning solution. Residual was related with PAN backbone and oxide form of cobalt. The report underlined that, when the acetate structure heated under the nitrogen environment, cobalt oxide was obtained at different crystalline structure due to treatment temperatures [34]. It was found that spinning operating parameters did not show the significant effect on thermal stability of the PAN/CoAc nanofibers. In addition to this, it was necessary to underline that the maximum weight loss for PAN/CoAc-1 was observed and 64% residual amount calculated at the end of the 3rd zone in which indicated by the completion of thermal degradation. Also, weight loss quantification result could be associated with the changing of fiber and pore diameters. Fig. 3c illustrates the DSC curves of neat PAN and composites. Under inert atmosphere the exothermic reactions had a maximum peak at around 308 °C at DSC curve of neat PAN matrix took place owing to cyclization of CN group [35] and final endothermic degradation of polymer occurred around 420 °C associated with the second zone. Curves were exhibited in one separate temperature range was 200–250 °C with endothermic reaction before the cyclization assigned to decomposition of acetate groups on the fiber structure. After the electrospinning of PAN with CoAc, heat flow regime was changed and the exothermic peaks became narrow. The endothermic peak positions at ∼270 °C indicated that acetate crystallization in the fiber structure and further heating resulted with the decomposition of acetate structure. It could be seen from the DSC curves, the glass transition (Tg) of the nanofiber was not clearly visible as compared with DMA curves. The change in damping behavior (tanδ) of PAN/CoAc fibers compared with PAN matrix fiber was given in Fig. 2d. Tg values were determined as 111 °C neat PAN matrix. Damping behavior of neat PAN matrix showed similar for all composites. It means that the mobility of polymer chains in the matrix and composites were quite similar and Tg position of composites marginally shifted by about 2–4 °C to lower temperatures due to a stiffness of the composites [36]. PAN/CoAc polymeric composites had a light pink color, degradation was finished at 450 °C according to the thermal analysis results, and black color samples were obtained."
8,Physicochemical properties of metal oxide nanofibrous composites,"3.2 Physicochemical properties of metal oxide nanofibrous composites Polymeric nanofibrous composites were subject to controllably heat treatment at 450 °C under the oxidative atmosphere in order to remove the polymeric matrix and transform acetate to oxide structure. Fig. 4a–d illustrates SEM images of heat treated polymeric PAN/CoAc composites subjected to calcination in order to remove polymer matrix. The nanofibers had a smaller diameter than those of PAN/CoAc composites after thermal degradation at 450 °C. Co3O4/Nfs-1 nanofibers with average diameters of 493 nm were obtained after respective heat treatment. By removing organic groups from the fiber and transferring to acetate structure to oxide, the macroporous diameter was diminishing below 100 nm, associated with 45% decreasing in fiber diameter. After the removing of organic groups, the corresponding pore size of the calcinated mats fabricated at different setup parameters was decreased, and the surface of nanofibers became more fibrous with minimum pore size ∼100 nm (Co3O4/NFs-1). It should be underlined that nanofiber diameter was merely a result of the electrospinning parameters. It was also noted that metal oxide nanofibers had a smaller diameter compared with as-spun nanofibers [37]. Fig. 4e shows XRD diagram of metal oxide nanofibres were thermally treated after the spinning process under oxidative atmosphere at 450 °C to create Co3O4/Nfs nanofibers. Thermal treatment of polymeric fibrous composites, including cobalt acetate, under the oxidative atmosphere, the sharp peak between 10° and 20° for PAN polymer matrix disappeared, and no diffraction peak was belonging with it was observed in the XRD pattern. This result indicated the decomposition of PAN and transformation of crystalline structure. Moreover, all acetate peaks disappeared and led to form cobalt oxide due to the decomposition of acetate anion. The sharp and highly intense peaks revealed the crystalline nature of the cobalt oxide structure. As shown in XRD pattern, the peaks at 2θ ∼ 31.38°, 36.98° and 65.49° matched well with the crystal planes (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (4 4 0), respectively and crystalline phase transformation revealed dramatically into cubic Co3O4, -indexed with 03-065-3103 JCPDS. These sharp peaks confirmed the products were highly crystalline with 20–30 nm size, calculated from the Scherrer equation. XRD pattern showed that characteristic peaks corresponding to the polymer matrix were noted to differ somewhat from that of metal oxide which could be ascribed to a new crystalline structure in nanofiber composite mainly due to oxidation of cobalt acetate molecules in the polymeric fibers. Any significant impurities related to other structures were undetected that showed the obtained nanofibers were high in purity. No additional peaks of different phases were been found. This indicated that Co ions effectively built into the Co3O4 lattice and the spinning parameters could not affect the change of the crystal phase. As could be seen from Fig. 4f, also FTIR spectrum of Co3O4/Nfs was in furtherance this result, all organic groups belonging to PAN polymer matrix and acetate content deboned from the nanofibers structure. The peaks observed at 556 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the metal oxide for tetrahedrally coordinated Co+2 metal ions of Co3O4 [38]."
9,Hydrogen evolution efficiency,"3.3 Hydrogen evolution efficiency NH3BH3 hydrolysis conducted at 60 °C using different nanofibrous composites as catalyst and hydrogen production characteristics depicted the time course of generated hydrogen volume. Amount of substances used in hydrolysis experiments were fixed at 5 mg catalyst, 1.2 mmole NH3BH3 and 10 ml H2O. Collection of experimental data was continued up to amount of hydrogen release reached 50 ml in order to compare to introduce nanofibers’ catalytic activity and time course was investigated in three parameters as induction time (IT, min), completion time (CT, min) and hydrogen generation rate (HGR, l H2 min−1 g−1 cat) related with electrospinning parameters. Fig. 5a shows the hydrogen generation results obtained in the presence of PAN/CoAc-1,-2,-3, and -4 composites. All composites showed an induction time of several minutes, before the starting of the hydrolysis. The induction time was a typical property of catalyst which was the time required for interaction of NH3BH3 with a catalytic active phase of catalyst. After the time needed for the interaction between NH3BH3 and nanofibers, fast hydrogen release was observed and, all PAN/CoAc nanofibers showed catalytic activity against NH3BH3 hydrolysis reaction. The interaction of NH3BH3 with H2O molecules over fibrous composites resulted in the generation of three molecules of hydrogen per mol of NH3BH3, by-products as H-B-O, and NH-O. Resulting of strong adsorption of NH3BH3 on catalytic sites, reaction energy barrier decreased, and a reactant-weak complex between NH3BH3 and H2O formed. The reaction continued with breaking of N and B bonds in complex to form by-products and of H2 molecules [39–42]. Fig. 5a and b illustrates that all the composites were active and catalyst in the form of polymeric and metal oxide nanofibrous composites showed almost similar catalytic behavior that release of hydrogen took place after a specific time in contact with NH3BH3 solution. The Co3O4/NFs-1 catalyst with the best performance found compared with others. HGR varied from 1.09 to 1.99 l H2 min−1 g−1 cat were found with the best performance belonged with PAN/CoAc-4. Also, the order of HER was found as Co3O4/NFs-1 > Co3O4/NFs-3 > Co3O4/NFs-2 > Co3O4/NFs-4. During the initial 50 ml of hydrogen generation, the HGR catalyzed by Co3O4/NFs-1, -2, -3 and -4 nanofibers were determined to be 2.54 l H2 min−1 g cat−1, 1.44 l H2 min−1 g cat−1, 2.01 l H2 min−1 g cat−1 and 1.33 l H2 min−1 g cat−1, respectively. In contrast to narrow diameters nanofibers, larger diameter composites show had lower catalytic activity towards H2 release from NH3BH3. Thermal treatment of polymeric composites had a positive effect on IT, but it was slightly affected. At best, IT and CT was reduced, while HGR was faster than those. The same amount of hydrogen volume was achieved by using PAN/CoAc-1 in 7.95 min after 3.5 min IT was higher than its thermally treated form-Co3O4/NFs-1- in 4.66 min after 3.7 min IT. The enhanced catalytic activity for metal oxide nanofibrous composites, during the reaction, was mainly attributed to the role of oxide structure after thermal treatment. During the thermal treatment, active sites on the surface were created while removal of polymeric matrix and oxidation of acetate structures. The maximum hydrogen generation rate was obtained with the same catalyst amount by using the Co3O4/NFs-1 catalyst had been found higher than that obtained using as-spun PAN/CoAc-1 composites providing a better catalytic performance due to an increase of active sites during the oxidation process. Furthermore, it was noted that these for all nanofibrous composites, the HGR significantly increased with increase in applied voltage and decrease in distance. HGR of PAN/CoAc composites were slightly improved with changing applied voltage from 15 kV to 25 kV, while distance led to drastic changes in HGR. Similarly to these observations, the nozzle to target distance was more effective parameter for improving the HGR for Co3O4/NFs nanofibers compared with applied voltage. Electrospinning process parameters had an influence on fiber diameters which is related to the catalytic activity. Statistical analyses results proved that working distance had more significant effect compared to an applied voltage to obtain more small diameters. These results indicated that morphological properties influence the performance of catalyst for NH3BH3 hydrolysis. It was noteworthy that electrospinning was a facility technique to obtain the nanoscale fibrous structured catalyst. In order to underline the influence of morphology on hydrogen generation performance, the inverse relation of fiber diameter with hydrogen generation rate was also illustrated in Fig. 5c. The highest hydrogen generation rate was achieved in the presence of lowest diameter fiber with a porous structure."
10,Further investigation on the most active nanofibrous composite,"3.4 Further investigation on the most active nanofibrous composite According to the physicochemical characterization results of Co3O4/Nfs-1 composite, had featured morphological structure among all Co3O4/Nfs, was selected representative sample for detail characterizations. Fig. 6a shows TEM analysis, had been performed to explore more in-depth morphological characterizations of representative Co3O4/Nfs-1 composites. As could be seen from TEM images, Co3O4/Nf-1 was included uniformly size distributed numerous nanoparticles with the porous structure and a larger specific surface area was connected with each other. The internal structure of grains was nearly the same, and the histogram showed the grain size of Co3O4/Nfs-1 distribution ranging from 18 to 33 nm with a maximum peak at 21 nm. Smaller pores probably related to the surface smoothing and formation of smaller particles during high-temperature calcination of polymeric nanofibrous composites. The surface properties of representative nanofiber Co3O4/Nfs-1, was given in Fig. 6b and c, was analyzed by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The BET surface area of Co3O4/Nfs-1 was determined 41.39 m2 g−1. Fig. 6b was exhibited type IV according to the IUPAC classification with type H3 hysteresis loops that demonstrated mesoporous structures of in Co3O4/Nfs-1 nanofibers (see Fig. 6c). The mesoporous structure was also indicated by XRD and TEM results. In particular, metal oxide Co3O4/NFs-1 showed the best surface properties regarding minimum fiber diameter (493 nm) and pore size (<100 nm) performing the highest catalytic activity as 3.75 min induction period and 4.62 min completion time compared with nanofibers. As could be seen from Fig. 6c, the results of H2 release results found out that the HGR activity of nanofibers depended on diameter and pore size which were affected by the electrospinning parameters. It was noteworthy to underline that results showed higher reactivity observed for Co3O4/NFs-1 which fabricated under higher applied voltage compared with Co3O4/NFs-3 resulted in the formation of thinner nanofiber diameter. At the same time, the findings explained lower distance values led to higher diameters which resulted in poor H2 generation activity [20,43,44]. Fig. 7 represents the repeatability test results of nanofiber Co3O4/Nfs-1 of hydrogen evaluation. The performance of run 8 times under conditions at 0.12 M NH3BH3. Repeatability is very important for the practical application of catalysts. In this sense, HGR after each run was calculated and Fig. 7 illustrated evaluation of catalytic activity concerning HGR and hydrogen yield (%) for repeatability test. It was found that hydrogen completely released from NH3BH3 and H2 yield maintained 100% was unchanged after each cycle. The productivity of hydrogen remained almost unchanged and preserved 71% of its initial activity after 5th runs. These results indicated that the nanofiber catalyst was catalytically active and it could be re-used again as an active catalyst in the hydrolysis of H3NBH3. It must be noted that decrease in HGR could be associated with passivation of catalyst surface by increasing amount of byproduct (boron products, e.g., metaborate) after each run which decreased the accessibility of active sites [45]. It was suggested that after 5th run under conditions the catalyst could be isolated from spent solution and regenerated by the washing process. Table 5 is listed the reported HGR values with respect to their fabrication to scientifically confirm the activity of the product nanofibers were compatible with the estimated researcher’s reports. The catalyst preparation method effected on the morphology of the catalyst. For improving the surface properties of the catalyst, various preparation methods have been investigated, and superficial techniques for practical applications are developed. In addition to this, type of precursor, alkoxide, promoter, and carrier used in synthesizes process of catalyst also depended on parameters especially to explain the interaction between fabrication method and catalyst activity. It is well-known that morphological and electronical properties could be altered by changing production parameters. In order to determine the accurate correlation between fabrication type and catalyst efficiency, it has been definitely necessary to compare the fabrication method by completely using the same basic materials, solvents, etc. and same thermal procedure. Quite simply, we could compare our results based on HGR and fabrication method. Results were reasonable and comparable with reported value as given in Table 5. We noted that considering the in situ reduction and solvothermal techniques, sol-gel-electrospinning method provides higher activation towards hydrogen generation. Together with this, Co-based catalyst prepared by co-precipitation and sol-gel/nitrate combustion methods exhibited better activities."
11,Conclusion,"We purposed a facile technique as electrospinning for fabrication of Co based PAN polymeric and oxide nanofibrous composites, provided high catalytic activity and the repeatability in the hydrolysis of NH3BH3 for hydrogen evolution. In present study, electrospinning process parameters were statistically optimized for the preparation of beadles, smooth and mesoporous surfaced with nano-scale fibers in order to integrate as a catalyst, which had not been addressed in literature about spinning of PAN and cobalt(II) acetate solutions and their transformation into cobalt oxide fibrous structures. Previous reports had been primarily focused on synthesizing of Co based catalysts by other techniques with aim to understand the using of different type of supports to improve their catalytic activity [45,46,48]. Some fundamental studies had been also focused on testing their catalytic activity in the field of hydrogen production [49–51]. The change of polymer type as well as metal precursor used in electrospinning process effect the fiber properties could be take into account by testing a catalytic activity towards to hydrogen generation. Hence, the interaction plot approach was applied to find which of depended parameters, applied voltage and working distance, directly effect of fiber dimensions. Results indicated that, 5 wt% Co-10 wt% PAN concentrated solution, electrospinning parameters set up at 25 kV applied voltage and 7.5 cm working distance created smooth, beadles, homogeneous, and porous nanofibrous structures. All observations from our experimental study afforded to relevant remarks: (i) Optimization of electrospinning conditions - for smooth and mesoporous fiber surface with minimum diameter resulted as in 25 kV and 7.5 cm, (ii) Thermal treatment of polymeric composites at 450 °C required to obtain cobalt oxide structure and remove polymer matrix that encapsulated of active sites, (iii) Cubic grain Co3O4/NFs-4 sized in 21 nm, (iv) Co3O4/NFs-4 -classified under mesoporous structure with surface area 41.39 m2 g−1, (v) Mesoporous and nano-size structured cobalt oxide fibrous catalyst provided 2.54 l H2 min−1 g cat−1 activity and –repeatability in hydrolysis of NH3BH3 as comparison to other reported catalysts with respect to their fabrication techniques such as in situ reduction (2.20 l H2 min−1 g cat−1), solvothermal (1.14 l H2 min−1 g cat−1), sol-gel/electrospinning (2.30 l H2 min−1 g cat−1) [47–49]. The experimental results of catalytic activity tests supported the nano-scale fiber contains metal oxide showed distinguished features in hydrogen production. It also demonstrates metal oxide structured nanofibrous composites could be obtained after thermal treatment of polymeric fibers. This implied that thermal conditioning of polymeric fibers gain attention in order to improve catalytic efficiency. This key finding beneficial for developing catalysts for hydrogen energy applications address in future research."
