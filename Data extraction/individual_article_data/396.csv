0,Introduction,"The overgrowing human population and the necessity of industrialization have compelled governments to use fossil-fuels more than ever before, regardless of their numerous disadvantages such as emission of greenhouse gases and air pollutants [1]. Additionally, well-recognized fossil-fuels deficiency and its harmful environmental effects that would be inherited to the next generations have made researchers to find environment-friendly and interminable alternative energy sources. Based on the statistical investigations, among all renewable energies, biomass can be recognized as the third abundant energy source after coal and petroleum, providing more than 14 % of the annual power generation worldwide [2]. With numerous categories and overwhelming potencies, researchers have investigated many types of biomass to introduce more applications for them and achieve higher efficiencies in different processes. On the other hand, in line with the human population, demand for chicken and egg as foodstuffs has gradually expanded and thus, more chicken farms and cultivating peasants have been established to address such increasing demand of chicken supply. Accordingly, the huge amounts of wastes generated in these industrial scale chicken farms needs environmentally friendly management since the uncontrolled disposal of such organic wastes would result in serious environmental issues. As reported, corn is one of the main resources of energy in poultry rations, thus, not only the chicken manure (CM), but also corncob (CC) should be massively disposed as the major residues of the poultry industries [3]. Due to the abundant harmful environmental consequences, such organic and heavy metal containing wastes should be properly disposed and eliminate [4]. Many traditional approaches such as direct burning, landfilling, and composting as soil fertilizer have been used to address this global challenge. However, each of these conventional treatments has specific adverse side-effects on the environment [5]. For instance, direct burning of CC as well as many other agricultural wastes, which is common in many countries, can lead to the emission of NOx into the atmosphere and thereby, resulting in acidic rains [6]. However, for sustainable farming, newly-oriented thermochemical methods and green biochemical techniques such as pyrolysis, torrefaction, liquefaction, anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and supercritical water gasification of biomass have been introduced, providing opportunities to not only address the demands for animal and agricultural waste disposal, but also convert such wastes into value-added products [7]. Amongst all the thermo- and biochemical conversion pathways, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is known as a high-throughput thermochemical process in which plenty of solidus materials such as coal, agricultural, animal, and municipal wastes, as well as many liquid substances such as waste oils can be devolatilized and converted into higher calorific value gaseous products [8]. It should be noted that, although hydrothermal gasification (HTG) could be carried out at either sub, near, or supercritical condition, the particular chemical and physical properties of water such as high diffusivity, low viscosity, and low dielectric constant beyond the critical point (i.e., 374 °C and 22.1 MPa) have made the supercritical water (SCW) an effectual solvent for the organic components known to be water-insoluble at ambient condition [9]. This implies that the SCWG could be considered as an excellent alternative for the outdated conventional processes used to treat the wet biomasses such as CM. It has been shown that the non-catalytic SCWG process would not be efficient and/or cost-effective enough to be used on the industrial scale [10]. Therefore, to achieve an effective solution, many studies have been conducted to assess the advantages of different types of catalysts. Application of the homogeneous catalysts (e.g. NaOH, KOH, K2CO3, and Na2CO3) have been restricted due to their low syngas yield, low H2 selectivity, and high-energy-consumer recycling process [11]. On the other hand, heterogeneous catalysts have been successfully employed to enhance the SCWG efficiency, reduce the reaction temperature and pressure, and control the formation of undesired components. According to the published experimental studies, two main objectives of reducing the tar and maximizing the yield of H2 production were considered to assess the efficiency of catalysts in SCWG process [12]. However, in spite of the recent developments in catalyst synthesis and synthesizing advanced catalysts of high H2 production efficiency, still better performances would be expected by modifying the catalyst supports with reactive rare earth metal oxides [13]. Due to the particular functions and unique characteristics of cerium oxide (CeO2) as one of the most reactive rare earth metal oxides, it has been widely utilized in many scientific and commercial applications including catalyst synthesis [14]. Many researchers have recently prepared and investigated the various nanostructures of CeO2 including nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanocubes, nanotubes, nanowires, and nanorods [15]. Shape-selective hybrid composites have been synthesized by blending a series of ceria nanocrystals with graphene oxide. It has been experimentally shown that, in the hydrothermal synthesis process, alkali (e.g. NaOH) concentration and functional temperature would be the most effective parameters influencing the structure of the synthesized CeO2 [13]. However, without any consideration regarding the catalyst nanostructure, some researchers have added ceria to the catalyst active layer to promote its catalytic activity, and found that, with the presence of CeO2, higher catalytic activity in terms of syngas and hydrogen gas production could be achived [16]. As a promising one-dimensional nanostructure, nanorods have shown great potentials as building blocks in different nano processes. Among all the synthesis methods of one-dimensional CeO2 nanorods introduced, hydrothermal synthesis has been known as an one-step, economical, and controllable synthesis method [17]. In this study, to produce H2 enrich syngas, catalytic and non-catalytic supercritical water gasification process of CM were considered and the optimum operational conditions in terms of temperature, residence time, and feedstock concentration were assessed to improve the production of H2 enrich syngas. It has been shown that the gasification process and hydrogen production efficiencies would be improved in presence of catalysts. In addition, under supercritical conditions that facilitates water splitting, cubic CeO2 nanocatalyst was employed to not only increase H2 and CO2 production through improved water–gas shift reaction, but also lower the CO and coke formation [18]. To do so, hydrothermal carbonization of CC, as another crucial residue of poultry farms, was used to prepare catalytic supports. The hydrochar derived from the HTC of the CC was activated to achieve a green and cost-effective carbon-based catalyst supports and then used to produce catalysts of nickel/activated carbon (Ni/AC) and Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods. At the determined optimum condition, the capability of two different catalysts in the generation of various gaseous products were then compared to the non-catalytic experiments. Regardless of investigation on the use of CC as a catalysts support precursor, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have attempted to evaluate the co-persistence of ceria and CC activated carbon in the catalyst support. Therefore, for the first time, AC-CeO2 has been used in this study to catalyze water-gas shift reactions and could possibly be considered in the conversion of different types of biomass. To differentiate between the obtained catalysts, morphology, and physiochemical properties of each was precisely studied. The produced gaseous products were finally characterized to provide a deep understanding of the reaction mechanism."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and characterization of feedstock,"2.1 Materials and characterization of feedstock CM and CC were collected from Safadasht chicken farm located in Kurdistan province, Iran. As the originally collected samples were consisted of many unwanted components such as sand grains and chicken nutrient residues, prior to being used, the samples were passed through a strainer and dried for 24 h under atmospheric conditions. The dried samples were then crushed and sieved to obtain a uniform powder of 100 μm diameter. The Ce(NO3)3.6H2O, Ni(NO3)3.6H2O, NaOH, and ZnCl2, which all purchased with 99 % purity from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland), were used to synthesize the catalysts. To assess the elemental composition of CM, CC, chicken manure hydrochar (CM–HC), corncob hydrochar (CC–HC), and corncob activated carbon (CC-AC), as well as all the derived bio-oils, the elemental analyses were conducted using a CHNS analyzer (FlashEA 1112 series, Thermo Finnigan Company, USA). The weight percentage of oxygen was also calculated by subtracting all the other elements (hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur), as well as the remaining ash content, from 100 %. Additionally, the biochemical composition of the CM were analyzed due to the standards and methods reported by Van Soest et al. [19]. Using Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA) (TGA/SDTA851 and METTLER-TOLEDO compact), proximate analyses were also performed on CM and CC to determine the thermal stability of the feedstocks. The feedstock samples were heated from 30 °C to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under inert (nitrogen) atmosphere. The TGA profiles were then used to identify the moisture, volatiles, fixed carbon, and ash contents of feedstocks. In addition, to precise evaluation of the alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMS) of CM and CC, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used (ASTM D5185)."
3,Catalytic and non-catalytic SCWG processes,"2.2 Catalytic and non-catalytic SCWG processes All the HTG tests were conducted using an one-factor-at-a-time method in a batch SCWG system equipped with a custom designed 40 ml non-stirred 316 stainless-steel U-shaped pipe reactor as described in our previous study [8]. Schematic of the experimental setup has been illustrated in Fig. 1 . To assess the air and oxygen inside the reactor, a stream of argon gas was used as a neutral carrier. Chicken manure and water with certain ratios (0.375 g to 0.525 g) were diluted to the desired concentration using certain volume of deionized water (18 mL) and injected into the reactor as a slurry mixture and sealed tightly. The internal air was purged out of the reactor by argon gas through a specific syringe located on the reactor and pressure changes were recorded using a high pressure gauge. Subsequently, the accurately sealed reactor was placed in a molten salt bath (a mixture of potassium nitrate, sodium nitrite, and sodium nitrate with 1:1:1 wt ratio), equipped with a precise K-type thermocouple and a PID temperature controller. The temperature was first fixed and then the reactor was placed in the salt bath. At the conclusion of each experiment (5–35 min), the reactor was submerged into an ambient-temperature water bath. Letting the entire water vapor be condensed by keeping the reactor in the water bath for 20 min, the amount of the produced gas, mainly consisted of H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and some light gaseous hydrocarbons was determined using a low-pressure gauge. Also, to assign the constituents of the produced gas, the gas samples were collected by a precise syringe and subsequently analyzed by a GC apparatus (GC-TCD-Varian 3400 and Teyfgostar-Compact). The whole solid and liquid products were also collected using a vacuum pump, poured into a clean 500 mL beaker, centrifuged at 1500 rcf, and passed through a 10 μm-pore size filter paper to complete the separation. Keeping the obtained wet hydrochar at 120 °C for 10 h, the acquired solid bio-products were dried and stored for further analyses described in section 2.5. Finally, a separatory funnel was employed to decant the water-soluble and water-insoluble liquid products. The catalytic experiments were carried out at the optimum operational condition and followed the same procedure as those of the non-catalytic experiments, but with the catalysts loaded in the reactor tube (catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1–10) prior to the injection of the feedstock slurry."
4,Support materials,"2.3 Support materials Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of CC was implemented to achieve a green and cost-effective carbon-based support [20]. Considering the resemblance between the chemical and biochemical composition of CC and canola stalk, based on our previous studies and the results obtained for the HTC of Canola stalk biomass, the HTC of CC was carried out at 260 °C for 60 min [8]. To do so, the CC slurry consisted of 3 g dried CC and 15 ml of deionized water was poured into the 50 ml non-stirred stainless-steel U-shaped pipe reactor and all the other steps, such as purging with argon gas, sealing, and immersing into the molten salt bath were conducted similar to that explained for the SCWG process (section 2.2). To manipulate the porosity of the synthesized HC, solutions of ZnCl2 (4 g ZnCl2 in 5 mL deionized water) and HC (1 g HC in 5 mL deionized water), were mixed vigorously and stirred for 2 h. Subsequently, the uniform mixture of HC and ZnCl2 was refluxed at 80 °C for 8 h. To complete the activation process, the dried penultimate product was then loaded into a horizontal quartz tube furnace and left for 2 h at 700 °C, under the flow of argon gas. To naturalize the pH of the final products, after cooling down to ambient temperature, an acid (HCl aqueous solution (5%)) washing step was done. To achieve the desired nanostructure, 4 mmol of Ce(NO3)3.6H2O (1.30 g) and 0.5 g of CC-AC were initially dissolved in 15 mL deionized water and then, threefold of NaOH was dispersed into the solution. After being vigorously mixed with a magnetic stirrer, the entire solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon equipped autoclave. To facilitate the formation of nanorods, the autoclave was then submerged into a heated molten salt bath (150 °C) and left for 12 h. The obtained black-garish precipitates were eventually removed and labeled as AC-CeO2 nanorods catalyst support [21]."
5,Preparation of catalysts,"2.4 Preparation of catalysts To obtain well-dispersed active sites, a specific amount of Ni(NO3)3.6H2O (10 wt%) was thoroughly dispersed in a minimal amount of deionized water (about 10 mL). Under stable stirring condition at 80 °C, the catalyst supports (AC or AC-CeO2 nanorods) were then added to the solution and left until the water was removed by evaporation (about 15 min). To reduce the catalysts (Ni/AC and Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods), hydrogen gas was introduced to the reactor (50 mL (STP)/min) to pass over the catalysts for 3 h at 350 °C. It has been reported that the Nin+ would be reduced on carbon surfaces via carbothermal reduction at high temperatures [22]. In addition, by using char-supported catalysts, it has been shown that NiO could also undergo carbothermal reduction through the catalytic cracking of biomass substrates, suggesting that the cokes deposited at lower temperatures would be further converted at higher temperatures and reduce Ni2+ by the reaction of carbothermal reduction between NiO and carbon deposits [18]: (1) C + N i O → N i + C O In the absence of oxygen, the catalysts were then dried for 2 h at 120 °C and subsequently heated to up to 400 °C under argon gas flow to eliminate all undesirable components."
6,Characterization of catalysts,"2.5 Characterization of catalysts The comparison between the expected weight gain and the actual loaded amount of transition metal on the catalyst supports was accomplished by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Varian VISTA-MPX, Palo Alto, USA). To prepare the samples, the specific amount of each catalyst support was ultra-sonicated for 3 h in the 5 mL solution of 1:1 HCl (Chem-lab 37 %) and HNO3 (Merck 65 %) for 3 h (acid digestion). After being filtered, the obtained solution was diluted to 250 mL with deionized water. The crystallinity of the metal impregnated catalysts was analyzed by a precise X-ray diffractometer (PhilipsPW1840 X-ray, USA). Using a monochromatized Cu/K radiation (k = 0.15 nm, 36 kV, and 2 mA), diffraction plots were obtained while the scanning angle was changed from 10° to 80° at a scanning rate of 2° min−1. In addition, FT-IR absorption technique (Bruker ISS-88) was used to confirm the formation of organic functional groups on the surface of support materials. The infrared beam was passed through a transparent pellet, with a 1:20 ratio of sample and KBr salt. Total and individual metal active sites on the surface of the catalyst supports were also estimated by H2 chemisorption. The specific amount of each sample was heated to 500 °C for one hour under continues oxygen gas flow in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020C analyzer and then, while the temperature was reduced from 500 °C to 300 °C, the H2 reduction was carried out for 3 h under the vacuum condition. At 35 °C, hydrogen pulses were then introduced under different pressures (75–775 mbar) to completing the chemisorption process. The morphological features of the catalyst support and fully-prepared catalysts, including their specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore radius, were measured via N2 adsorption-desorption using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis Micromeritics TriStar ІІ ASAP 2020). To have a thorough study on the physical and morphological structure of the catalyst supports, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) imaging (SIGMA VP-500, ZEISS, Germany) was also carried out on the samples."
7,Characterization of byproducts,"2.6 Characterization of byproducts Bio-oil is a secondary product that would be produced at SCWG as a byproduct. Elemental analysis (section 2.1) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Agilent Technology, Japan) were used to analyze the bio-oil (BO) obtained in each experiment. Furthermore, the total organic carbon (TOC) of water-soluble products were assessed (Shimadzu, TOC-L analyzer). The composition of the gas products was also analyzed using a gas chromatographer (Varian 3400 and Teyfgostar-Compact) equipped with a methanizer, a flame ionization detector (FID), and a packed Proapak Q–S 80/100 stainless steel column (length of 30 m and internal diameter of 0.53 mm)."
8,Chemical reactions,"2.7 Chemical reactions SCWG has been found to be a complicated process, either in practice or in theory [12]. Hydrolysis, pyrolysis, liquefaction, extraction, and gasification are the five main chemical conversions taking place in a lignocellulosic SCWG process [23]. Following reaction (Eq. 2) has been introduced as a simplified reaction representing the whole chemical reactions taking place in an SCWG process [24]: (2) C H x O y + 2 - y H 2 O → C O 2 + 2 - y + x 2 H 2 Δ H ≫ 0 where x and y are the feedstock H/C and O/C molar ratios, respectively. In a competitive environment, different gaseous products would be generated through the following three reactions [25]: Steam Reforming: (3) C H x O y + 1 - y H 2 O → C O + 1 - y + x 2 H 2 Δ H = 310 ( K J m o l ) Water–gas shift (WGS): (4) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H = - 41 ( K J m o l ) Methanation: (5) C O + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + H 2 O Δ H = - 206 ( K J m o l )"
9,Process data interperetation,"2.8 Process data interperetation Gas yield was calculated as the ratio of each gas produced and the feedstock mass fed into the reactor as following [26]: (6) G a s y i e l d ( m m o l . g - 1 ) = m m o l e o f g a s e o u s p r o d u c t g r a m s o f c h i c k e n m a n u r e In addition, carbon liquefaction efficiency (CLE), carbon solidification efficiency (CSE), carbon gasification efficiency (CGE), and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) were calculated as follows [27]: (7) C L E % = G r a m s o f c a r b o n i n a q u e o u s p r o d u c t s G r a m s o f c a r b o n i n c h i c k e n m a n u r e * 100 (8) C S E % = G r a m s o f c a r b o n i n s o l i d p r o d u c t s G r a m s o f c a r b o n i n c h i c k e n m a n u r e * 100 (9) C G E % = G r a m s o f c a r b o n i n g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s G r a m s o f c a r b o n i n c h i c k e n m a n u r e * 100 (10) CCE = CGE + CLE + CSE Regardless of Eq. 10, in all the non-catalytic experiments, the calculated CGE and CSE percentages were subtracted from 100 % to find CLE, implying that the CCE changes were ignored in such processes. However, in the catalytic experiments, CLE could be determined by separating the obtained water-insoluble substances from the other products and then, Eq. 10 could be applied to calculate the CCE. Furthermore, the H2 production yields could be calculated as following [12]. (11) H y d r o g e n s e l e c t i v i t y = Y i e l d o f H 2 Y i e l d o f o t h e r g a s s e s In addition, the Dulong formula could also be used to calculate the higher heating values (HHV, MJ/Kg) of the obtained BO and HC, based on their elemental compositions [28]: HHV = 0.3491 MC + 1.1783 MH + 0.1005 MS – 0.1034 MO – 0.0151 MN – 0.0211 Mash(12)"
10,Results and discussion,
11,Feedstock and AC precursor characteristics,"3.1 Feedstock and AC precursor characteristics As shown in Table 1 , with lower amount of lignin, the cellulosic content of the CM was almost similar to that of the agricultural wastes reported by Lee et al. [29], thereby implying that the CM would be a better candidate for H2 production. However, it should be noted that such similarities or differences could also be related to the age, type, domestication, climate, and diet of the animals. In addition, as the composition of the catalyst support and specially its carbon content would be important in catalyst preparation (Eq. 1), composition of the CC–HC has also been reported in Table 1. After being carbonized, the carbon content of the CC-AC was increased by 14 % to almost 61 wt%. Fig. 2 demonstrates the TG-DTG curves of the proximate analysis of CM and CC. As shown, the curves were consisted of three temporal regions. The first region (50–180 °C) was attributed to the dehydration and elimination of high volatile materials such as external moisture and cellular water. Here, following the previously published procedure, the ash and moisture contents of both samples were measured separately to ensure the accuracy of the announced information [30]. The next region (180–540 °C) is mainly corresponded to the devolatilization and breakage of the temperature sensitive cells such as cellulose and hemicellulose contents of the samples. Heating the samples beyond 540 °C resulted in the third weight loss region of the TG-DTG curves in which the main DTG peak at around 650–750 °C was related to the decomposition of lignin contents. Slower decomposition rate of the solid residues remained from the prior stages could be inferred by the relatively lower slope of TGA curves at the third region. In addition, according to the obtained results, the higher fixed carbon percentage of CC than CM indicated that this agricultural residue would be a better candidate for the HTC process. All the results obtained here were in line with the previously published data and as explained before, the observed slight differences could be attributed to the domestication, age, and/or climate variation [5]."
12,Characterization of catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of catalysts 3.2.1 FT-IR Fig. 3 A shows the results of FT-IR evaluation of two different catalyst supports. The broad peak at about 3400 cm−1 for both graphs corresponds to the alcoholic OH stretching [31,32]. Although due to the presence of water molecules higher intensities were achieved for this peak in the KBr cell, in the case of AC-CeO2 nanorods, the addition of CeO2 probably heightened the population of OH functional groups on the surface of the catalyst support. Not only the OH stretching peak, but also the intensity of the peak related to the CO stretching of aliphatic ketones (around 1710 cm−1) were evidently increased, indicating that the formation of AC-blended ceria nanorods could proliferate catalyst supports by sufficient oxygen-containing functional groups. Accordingly, further oxidations such as acid treatment required to generate highly metal-dispersed catalyst would be irrelevant. The slight reductions observed in the intensity of the other peaks, such as those of the CH stretching of alkenes (2920 and 2890 cm−1), CH stretching of methyl group (1540 cm−1), aromatic CC stretching(1410 cm−1), and some other peaks observed between 500 to 1000 cm−1 attributed to CH bending of alkene, implied that the lower concentration of carbonic bands could directly affect the FT-IR spectra [33]. 3.2.2 Wide-angle XRD In line with previously obtained results, in addition to the three main NiO peaks located at 37 °, 43 °, and 62.5 °, Ni impregnated AC catalyst had two district XRD peaks at about 27° and 32° which could be related to the diffraction of its carbonaceous structure [26]. The four NiO obtained at similar angles (Fig. 3B) were related to the cubic NiO crystalline plane phase reflections in the amorphous form. By adding Ceria, no significant peaks could be detected at previously observed positions for AC, which could be in part related to either highly dispersed AC fragments among Ceria nanostructures or incorporation of AC and Ceria and formation of a single uniform solid phase. However, considering the high concentration of carbonaceous materials at the beginning of the reaction, AC agglomeration was inevitable and thus, two sharp peaks were expected in the catalyst XRD diagram. This implied that such observations could be resulted from the high AC dispersion of AC fragments. On the other hand, uniform crystallinity of derived catalyst supports demonstrated by FESEM analysis (Fig. 4 B) endorsed the formation of AC-CeO2 nanorods. Consequently, the obtained results indicated that, when Ce(NO3)3.9H2O and AC precursors were employed in the presence of a strong base, well-shaped nanomaterials could be achieved through facile NaOH-hydrothermal precipitation [28]. 3.2.3 FESEM Using FESEM imaging, morphological structure of the obtained AC (Fig. 4A) and AC-CeO2 nanorods (Fig. 4B) were studied as the catalyst supports. According to the obtained results, highly porous structure of activated carbon (Fig. 4A) implied that the ZnCl2 could be effectively used as a chemical activator. However, although physical variables affecting the ZnCl2 activation have been extensively studied in literature [34], to the best of our knowledge, the exact mechanisms by which it affects the carbonaceous structure of hydrochar are still unclear [5]. However, some pathways such as evaporation of ZnCl2 to Zn and Cl have proved to be able to enhance the porosity and some other morphological features of the carbonaceous precursors. The uniform nanorod structure (Fig. 4B) indicated that, aiming for a novel catalyst supports, hydrothermal method could be effectively employed to modify the typical green catalyst supports, such as AC, by specific metal oxides, such as ceria. Such uniform structure with pure and single-shaped composite-like nanorods could also be deduced from the XRD analysis results (Fig. 3B). Great applicability of such an approach could also be inferred from the aggregate free AC-CeO2 nanorod catalyst supports (Fig. 4B). To study the dispersion of Ce and C atoms on the surface of the composite-like catalyst support, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was carried out. Fig. 4C and 4D display the EDX mapping of Ce (purple dots) and C (red dots) atoms. Due to the high distribution of Ce, more oxygen-laden (i.e., Ce atoms) functional groups such as −OH could be placed on the surface of the modified catalyst support (section 3.2.1). Consecuently, more distributed metal sites can be expected, at least, on the exterior layer of the catalyst support than single AC [35]. Therefore, the activity of the Ni active sites to interact with biomass macromolecules would be stimulated. The oxygen-rich surface of the composite-like support was also confirmed through the obtained FESEM results (Fig. 4E). 3.2.4 H2-TPR The reducibility of the supported Ni catalysts was studied using H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis (Fig. 3C). The reduction profile of Ni/AC catalyst revealed a single-peak with two distinct shoulders at almost 345 °C and 525 °C, attributed to the reduction of NiO crystals (as the main active phase) to metallic Ni and the reduction of Ni cations who are in a strong interaction with AC, respectively [26]. The peak at 450 °C was related contributed to the interaction of Ni atoms to the support [36]. In comparison with the Ni/AC sample, the NiO active sites impregnated on the surface of the AC-CeO2 nanorods were reduced at the lower temperature. The main H2-TPR peaks of Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods could also be classified into three temporal categories. The first peak, occurring at around 300 °C was relevant to the reduction of oxygen-laden species on the surface of the composite-like catalyst. The peak observed at 350 °C was resulted from H2 consumption by NiO interacted with catalyst support. More hydrogen consumption through the reduction of CeO2 particles to Ce2O3 is the reason of such intense peak in that temperature interval. The last detectable peak at 430 °C represented the overall H2 absorbed by the NiO particles that had high interactions with the catalyst support. Therefore, changing the interaction between Ni and catalyst support, the presence of ceria enhanced the catalyst reducibility [37]. 3.2.5 BET, ICP-OES, and chemisorption Pore characteristics such as pore volume, average pore diameter, pore size distribution, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of AC, composite-like catalyst supports, and used catalysts were assessed through N2 physical adsorption-desorption at 77 K (Table 2 ). The results obtained for the specific surface areas and pore volumes were in line with those depicted in FESEM images (Fig. 4). A typical type-one isotherm associated with microporous structure (< 2 nm) was achieved for the ZnCl2 activated carbon which was in great accordance with other previously reported results [38]. Dividing the isotherm into two different regions of high-rising (at the relative pressures of less than 0.1) and slow-rising sections, N2 would be respectively adsorbed by the micropores and mesopores of AC. In addition, the capillary condensation of mesoporous could probably lead to H-1 hysteresis loop which would often be associated with agglomerated uniform spheres or/and cylindrical pore channels [39]. Accordingly, such observations approve the presence of mesopores in the structure of AC. On the other hand, with the average pore diameter of 14.56 nm, the BET isotherm of AC-CeO2 nanorods exhibited a type IV isotherm (Fig. 5 A). As reported in the literature, although the type of hysteresis loop highly depends on the pore size distribution, pore geometry, and other textural features, in general, this type of BET isotherm also specifies the mesoporous structure [40]. As reported in Table 2, with simultaneous incorporation of AC and CeO2, the BET surface area of the composite-like support was decreased from 412.20 m2. g−1 (AC) to 94.52 m2. g−1. On the other hand, when compared to AC with a pore volume of 0.24 cm3. g−1, the total pore volume of AC-CeO2 nanorods was significantly increased to 0.37 cm3. g−1, providing a favorable framework for hydrogen generator reactions. The pore size distribution of catalyst supports has been illustrated in Fig. 5B. Based on the experimental results, with the impregnation of Ni and NiO active sites on the surface of AC, the BET surface area was reduced by 41 %, while only 28 % reduction was observed in AC-CeO2. Such significant difference in pore volume and BET surface area could be probably attributed to the pore blockage by the nickel active sites. As proposed and approved by H2-TPR, differences in the catalyst supports pore blockage could also be explained by the smaller NiO fragments and larger pore diameters of the AC-CeO2 nanorods [10]. To specify the dispersion and the number of active sites on AC and AC-CeO2 nanorods catalyst supports, H2-chemisorption analysis was employed. As described earlier in the XRD interpretation, due to the high dispersion of Ni on the surfaces, the reaction of nickel with oxygen was highly probable. Therefore, when absorbed by Ni-O bands, the chemisorbed oxygen atoms could be replaced by hydrogen atoms. Considering the optimized H2-chemisorption temperature reported by Zhou et al. [41] and the obtained results of H2-TPR, nickel oxide reduction to metallic Ni would take place at round 350 °C. In addition, as the reduction of Ce(IV) to its metallic state occurs at almost 550 °C, the data reported in Table 2 correspond to NiO active sites without any interference of the other metallic or non-metallic agents [42]. The AC-CeO2 nanorods possessed better active sites dispersion rather than that of the AC which is originated from the chemical characteristics of each support. As discussed for the IR interpretation, NaOH-aided hydrothermal synthesis provided more hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of the catalyst support and it consequently led to better NiO dispersion. As well as the morphological information, Table 2 summarizes the ICP- OES results, comparing the targeted and actual Ni loaded on the supports. Due to the little differences (0.7 % for AC and 1.2 % for AC-CeO2 nanorods), the wet impregnation method was found as a highly practical process by which the metallic active sites can be impregnated on the catalyst supports with a great accuracy."
13,Operational variables and catalysts effect on gaseous products,"3.3 Operational variables and catalysts effect on gaseous products 3.3.1 Noncatalytic SCWG Supercritical water gasification is a complex process in which under high temperature and in supercritical water environment, the natural polymers in the biomass would be cracked into solid, liquid, and gaseous products. However, although in overall, the reactions for SCWG can be explained by steam reforming reaction (Eq. 3), despite extensive studies on the conversion of model compounds, conversion of the biopolymers into gaseous compounds has not been described in detail and has left unclear. The SCWG process conditions were changed systematically to assess the impacts that the operational parameters could have on the results of the SCWG process (Table 3 ). Such variations in the amount of each gaseous produce in response to the operational conditions could also be theoretically estimated by considering the three primary reactions of SCWG (i.e., steam reforming, WGS, and methanation), the overall reaction, and their enthalpies. While the residence time and feedstock concentration were kept constant at 30 min and 2.5 wt%, the impact of temperature on the total gas production and H2 yield in the SCWG of CM was studied by increasing the temperature from 375 to 450 °C, (Experiments 1–4, Table 3). Due to the high endothermic nature of steam-reforming reaction (Eq. 3) as the main H2 generator pathway, more carbohydrate decomposition and consequently more CO and H2 production would be expected at higher temperatures. On the other hand, considering the methanation reaction (Eq. 5), the higher the temperature, the more the reaction would be shifted to the left and thus, the more the CO and H2 would be consumed. In addition, although H2 production would be hindered in the exothermic WGS reaction (Eq. 4), such reduction could be neglected due to relatively low reaction enthalpy (−41 KJ. mol−1). Consequently, considering the endothermic nature of the overall reaction (Eq. 2) [43], gas yield was expected to be positively influenced by temperature elevation. According to the results depicted in Fig. 6 A, experimental results were consistent with the theoretical expectations where the total gas yield was enhanced from 14.13–21.19 mmol.gr biomass−1 by increasing the temperature from 375 °C to 450 °C. To be more specific, in such temperature elevation, H2, CO, and CO2 gas yields were improved with the factor of 2.14, 1.43, and 1.76, respectively. The lower improvement achieved for the carbon monoxide could be explained by the high portion of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in the CM samples that had the potential to stimulate and catalyze the WGS reaction [44]. On the other hand, the reduced amount of CH4 could also be attributed to the hindered methanation reaction [45]. Improvements observed in other gaseous hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6) were probably resulted from the thermal cleavage of biomass macromolecules at higher temperatures through thermal processes such as hydrolysis [27]. The carbon contents of solid, liquid, and gas products achieved at different temperatures have been demonstrated in Fig. 6D. According to the obtained experimental results, by increasing the reaction temperature, CGE was increased significantly, while CLE and CSE were experienced an intense decline. As mentioned earlier, such observation could be explained by the high endothermic steam-reforming reaction that promoted the biomass molecules to be gasified and converted from liquid and solid phases to gas phase. Such explanation could be confirmed by the results of the TOC analysis in which the higher temperature resulted in less organic carbon in the liquid products (i.e., less CLE). Based on the experimental results, 450 °C was found to be the optimum temperature in the SCWG process and thus, consistently used in all the remaining non-catalytic experiments. With 30 min resistance time, the impact of feedstock concentration on the main products yields and distribution was studied by increasing the concentration from 2.5 to 3.5 wt%. Based on the literature, the biomass moisture content or the amount of water in which the biomass particles are embedded, directly affects the decomposition and hydrolysis of its organic compounds. It should be noted that, this water is the water inherent in the structure of the biomass and is different from that of the reaction medium. [27]. This means that, when not sufficiently surrounded by the water molecules, part of the biomass fragments could possibly be left unreacted, thereby restricting their gasification. In addition, decreased water content of the reaction medium has been shown to be in favor of methanation and against the WGS and steam reforming reactions [46]. On the contrary, at higher water to feed ratios (i.e., low concentrations), the water molecules can freely react with biomass clusters and convert them to light hydrocarbons such as C2H4 and C2H6 to produce H2 through steam reforming reaction [45]. Therefore, the low amounts of the C2H4 and C2H6 in the overall produced gas obtained in experiment number 4, could be justified by the higher H2 generation (Table 3). Also, by keeping the water content constant and introducing more feedstock, as the water/biomass ratio was reduced, H2, CO, and total gas yield were all decreased gradually with the factor of 0.55, 0.70 and 0.85, respectively. As seen in Fig. 6D, the CGE was profoundly affected by the variation of feedstock concentration. At high feedstock concentrations, being left unreacted, most of the biomass was turned into solid residue and enhanced the CSE at such elevated feedstock concentrations. Moreover, feedstock concentration revealed minor influences on aqueous products and the optimum value of CLE was found to be around 3.00 wt%. This implied that, low, mediocre, and high feedstock concentrations were respectively in favor of gaseous, liquid, and solid (i.e., hydrochar) production. To study the effect of residence time on the SCWG of CM, it was changed from 5 to 35 min at constant feedstock concentration and temperature of 2.5 wt% and 450 °C, respectively. As reported in literature [47], in SCWG, gases would be initially produced through steam reforming (Eq. 3) and WGS (Eq. 4) reactions and afterwards, through the methanation (Eq. 5) reaction at later stages. However, although the overall gas yield was gradually increased in SCWG, in line with published reports, the amount of H2 decreased after experiencing an apex point at 15 min [48]. According to Table 3, the total gas yield was increased slightly and eventually reached to 21.32 mmol.gr biomass−1 in the most prolonged experiment, while H2 production was maximized in experiment number 7. This implied that it took almost 15 min for methanation reaction to start consuming the hydrogen and enhancing the diversity of gaseous products (e.g., increased amount of CH4 after 15 min). Carbon distribution in different products indicated that, regardless of overall weight of hydrochar, residence time had negligible impact on the carbon content of the solid material, meaning that the promoted carbon percentage in gaseous products were originated from aqueous substances. However, considering the weight of hydrochar formed, it could be concluded that the polymerization of some large biomass molecules would be promoted at extended residence times, leading to the formation of higher amounts of solid residues. Collectively, considering the high impact of temperature and feedstock concentration and the moderate effect of residence time on final products, experiment number 7 with highest H2 production (5.75 mmol.g−1 CM), H2 selectivity (30.27 %), and syngas yield (8.75 mmol.g−1) and was found to be optimal test and its operational conditions were replicated in subsequent catalytic experiment. 3.3.2 Catalysts effect on gaseous products To maximize the proficiency of the SCWG process, especially in terms of H2 and syngas efficiency, two nickel supported catalysts were introduced into the hydrothermal media. The catalytic experiments were carried out at the optimal operational conditions similar to that determined in noncatalytic experiments (section 3.3.1) and the distribution and nature of specific products were scrutinized to verify the impact of CeO2 associated with AC. As discussed, being fully surrounded by water molecules at high temperatures for an adequate time, the degradable macromolecules of initial feedstock would decompose into a wide range of water-soluble and insoluble substances, hydrochar, and light gaseous molecules. With the introduction of catalysts, the carbon recovery of gaseous products was significantly enhanced, implying the activity of nickel active sites impregnated on the surface of the catalysts. Compared to the Ni/AC catalyst, Ce-modified catalyst represented a better performance in hydrogen gas generation (i.e., H2 efficiency) due to the higher promotion of CC bond cleavage and methanation reaction, resulted from better dispersion of metallic active sites as verified by the chemisorption analyses results. In fact, any agglomeration of metallic sites was prevented by the oxygen-proliferated surface of the AC-CeO2 nanorods (confirmed by FT-IR results) providing them an opportunity to be exposed to more initial and intermediate free radicals. Moreover, it has been reported that the high temperature can negatively affect the catalysts performance [16]. Not only a series of structural problems, but also some physical issues such as coke coverage could partially deactivate the catalysts [10]. Herein, the incorporation of CeO2 resulted in the highest gas production yield of 27.78 mmol.g−1 CM, whereas the solid and liquid product yields were favorably decreased. In contrary, CLE and CSE of the catalytic experiments were significantly reduced, implying that the WGS (Eq. 4) and steam reforming (Eq. 3) reactions could be improved in such processes. Also, exposing the highly endothermic bio-oil cracking and char reformation reactions to high temperatures could hinder the production of water-insoluble and solid materials and accelerate the rate of gas and syngas production. The composition of the gas samples was significantly changed by the introduction of catalysts. In this study, although H2 and CO (as syngas) were the main interests, to assess the gas formation mechanisms and evaluate the catalysts influences, productions of the other gases were also studied (Fig. 7 ). According to the obtained results, the methanation reaction was accelerated in both catalytic performances as the main pathway to produce CH4. As shown in Fig. 7A, when compared to the non-catalytic experiments, the utilization of Ni/AC could lead to the highest methane level of 1.54 mmol.g−1 CM. In addition, although gradually suppressed by pore blockage, the slight differences observed in the amount of CH4 in the two conducted catalytic experiments could be possibly resulted from the inconsistencies in initial activation of methanation reaction on the porous structure of Ni/AC catalyst. The increments recorded in the amount of other gaseous hydrocarbons (i.e., ethane and ethene) supported the positive influence of Ni active sites in CC bond cleavage and turning heavy undesired biomass macromolecules to more beneficial products [49]. Due to the drastic endothermic essence of steam reforming reaction and the similar activity of catalysts and temperature, the more effective the catalyst, the higher the amount of H2 and CO [50]. Compared to the non-catalytic experiments, the amount of produced H2 was increased by 48 % and 76 % when Ni/AC and Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods catalysts were employed, respectively. Due to the consumption of CO in the WGS reaction, the amounts of CO were found to be almost identical in catalytic and non-catalytic reactions. However, resulted from the WGS reaction products, 137 % and 171 % enhancements achieved in the amount of carbon dioxide indicated that the overall reaction could be shifted to the right by the application of the modified catalysts. 3.3.3 Catalysts effect on aqueous products The influences of the catalysts on the chemical composition of final water-insoluble substances were assessed through a GC–MS analysis instrument equipped with a NIST mass spectral database. As depicted in Fig. 7B, the obtained bio-oils were all composed of the components that could be classified in ten distinct categories based on their main organic functional groups. The percentages reported for each category was calculated by dividing its corresponding chromatographic area by that of the all detected components. To do so, each component possessing a chromatographic area of less than 0.5 % of the total area was neglected. Considering the quantity and quality of the derived substances in catalytic processes, it could be concluded that the both catalysts had significant impacts on not only the gaseous products, but also on the chemical composition of derived bio-oils. As the most abundant category, phenol and its derivatives such as 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-methyl-Phenol and 4-methyl-phenol were originated from the degradation of lignin complex structure [51]. It has been extensively studied and reported that the dealkylation and hydrolysis of lignin molecules, known as one the most durable structures of lignocellulosic biomass, facilitate the breaking of CC bonds and accelerate the production of phenol and its derivatives in the hydrothermal process [40]. As attested by ICP-OES analysis, higher amounts of phenolic compounds could also be expected when some inorganic species such as alkali and alkaline earth elements were presented in the medium [52]. Despite higher reactivity of Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods in the decomposition of feedstocks macromolecules, when compared to the Ni/AC, the lower achieved phenolic compounds could be attributed to the conversion of phenolic compounds to other substances such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons through dehydroaromatization, dehydration, and hydrogenolysis reactions [53]. Collectively, due to the ability of the synthesized Ni catalysts in degradation of lignin, both catalysts drastically increased phenol and phenol-containing molecules, whereas, due to the capability of Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorodss in the consumption of such compounds, a slight decrement was observed. In spite of the CM dependency on poultry diet, N-heterocyclic compounds such as imidazole, are known to be the most abundant component of the CM. Although the Maillard reaction of amino acids and sugars has been known as the primary pathway of N-heterocyclic compounds production, the introduction of active catalysts could propel the radicals to interact with each other, generate gaseous products, and consequently hinder the N-compounds formation [54]. Therefore, reduction in N-heterocyclic molecules would be expected when the nano-catalysts were employed to catalyze the reaction. Furan and its derivatives could also be generated through the degradation of the CC bonds of cellulose and hemicellulose molecules. Considering the high activity of the catalysts equipped by transition metals, macromolecules of the feedstock would be decomposed to lighter compounds. Accordingly, it could be concluded that furan was the only constituent of its category when the composite-like based catalyst was employed [55]. The overall acid content was decreased in the catalytic experiments. As represented in Fig. 7B, due to the high efficiency of Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods in transforming the acids into hydrocarbons, the highest amount of CO2 was generated in the presence of Ni/AC-CeO2 through the decarboxylation reaction. Furthermore, esterification reaction might also be the other reason for the conversion of acidic compounds to ester derivatives. Also, a great portion of such generated molecules was converted to the aliphatic hydrocarbons through cracking reactions in the catalytic hydrothermal media. Besides, with the aid of dehydration, cracking, and aromatization reactions, some alcohol content could also be converted to aliphatic hydrocarbons [28]."
14,Comparison with previous studies,"3.4 Comparison with previous studies Based on the composition of the feedstock (Table 1), the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield of CM that could be expected from the gasification of chicken manure would be 35 mol H2/kg CM. However, in practice, the reported experimental values have been always far less than the such theoretical value. Table 4 demonstrates some conducted SCWG studies reported in literature. The operational conditions and the utilized catalysts have also been reported in this table. It should be noted that, although some investigations revealed more hydrogen gas in the content of the gaseous products, the higher temperature restricts their application. Considering the results summarized in Table 4, the gasification yield and hydrogen gas achieved in this study was among the highest reported in literature. Additionally, considering the catalytic studies, with the highest gasification yield at almost the lowest temperature, the obtained results indicated that the Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods was able to enhance the H2 production by the factor of 1.76 and thus, was recognized as one of the most effective catalysts."
15,Conclusion,"By designing 12 different non-catalytic experiments, main variables affecting the SCWG of chicken manure were investigated and optimized, attentively. According to the obtained results, optimum temperature, residence time, and feedstock concentration leading to the highest gas production was determined to be 450 °C, 15 min, and 2.5 wt%, respectively. Also, temperature was found to be the most influencing parameter affecting the overall gas yield (1.50-fold) and hydrogen gas selectivity (1.42-fold) while the other parameters revealed inferior effects. In addition, as one of the most crucial residues of the poultry farms, corncob was used to prepare the support of the catalysts. Using chemical activation and surfactant-free hydrothermal synthesis methods, two different catalysts were synthesized and applied in the SCWG at the obtained optimal condition. In spite of the positive impact of both catalysts, Ni/AC-CeO2 nanorods exhibited the highest syngas production (13.32 mmol.g−1 CM), H2 selectivity (36.42 %), and total gas production (27.78 mmol.g−1 CM) which was mainly contributed to the presence of ceria."
