0,Introduction,"To reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions deriving from the use of transportation fuels as well as to fulfill the increasingly stringent EU legislation, the most pursued path resides in the use, as such or as additives, of small aliphatic bio-alcohols, mostly because their employment requires minor adjustments in spark ignition (SI) engines. However, only C1 C2 alcohols have established themselves on the fuel market, while the use of higher homologous is still a research matter, mainly because, to date, methanol and ethanol can be more easily made on large industrial-scale with competitive pricing. While bio-alcohol fuels, in general, have proven to ameliorate combustion processes by reducing harmful by-products such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and soot [1,2], the beneficial outcome on NOx emissions is still controversial [3–6]. Nitric oxide (NO) is the most abundant species of NOx emissions [7]. In this regard, improving the understanding of the combustion chemistry of NO formation in alcohol + air flames via accurate measurements and subsequent development of appropriate kinetic models, is a critical step for the design of proper clean combustion engines. Only a few dedicated studies on NO formation and consumption from propyl alcohols fuels are available in the literature. Bohon et al. [8] investigated the effect of OH functional group on non-thermal NO formation by studying several C1 C3 hydroxylated fuel + air flames. A decrease in prompt-NO formation was observed as the OH/C ratio increases; consequently, the lowest amounts of NO were observed in the methanol flames. Further investigations showed how part of the oxidation of hydroxylated fuels goes through the formation of the formyl radical (HCO), inhibiting the prompt-NO route related to CH radical formation, i.e., non-thermal NO formation. NO formation of C1 C4 alkanes and alcohol fuels was experimentally investigated by Watson et al. [9,10]. The methodology involved the use of a jet-wall stagnation flame configuration coupled with planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) diagnostic to evaluate species concentration profiles in the post-flame region. Kinetic models available from literature were employed and assessed against experimental data. Some difficulties were encountered by the employed kinetic models [9] in identifying the correct position of the flame front, thus undermining the predicted thermal NO formation, which is strongly dependent on the residence time and so on the burning velocity of the fuel mixture. The following work from the same authors [10] was therefore focused on NO quantification in fuel-rich conditions, where its formation is basically located in the flame region and the time scale effects are less relevant. The tendency of the hydroxylated compounds to produce less NO than the respective alkane with the same number of carbon atoms was observed [9,10] and attributed to lower flame temperatures and the inhibitory effect of the alcohol functional group on CHx radical formations, even though such an effect became less prominent for higher oxygenated homologies [10]. Moreover, authors observed a linear dependence between NO and CH concentrations when results were scaled by the residence time, highlighting once again, even in the prompt region, the importance of a rigorous determination of the burning velocity for an accurate NO evaluation [10]. Bohon et al. [11,12] studied non-thermal NO formation in premixed C1 C3 alcohol and alkane flames. Flames were stabilized on a porous-plug McKenna burner [11,12] and Bunsen burners [12], while measurements were performed using an NO analyzer [11] and the PLIF technique [12]. A kinetic model, based on the Aramco 1.3 mechanism [13] extended to include C3 chemistry from Sarathy et al. [14] as well as NOx chemistry from GDFkin-3.0 [15,16], was also assessed against experimental data. The experimental uncertainty in [11] was evaluated in the range of ±10% and took into account the uncertainty related to the measured flame temperature profile and the estimated probing effects. Model predictions failed in reproducing experimental results and showed a general underestimation of NO concentration, especially for propanols + air flames [11,12]. Mechanism analysis highlighted a reduced depletion of NO through the NO-HCN reburning route, de facto scaling the role of NO reduction in alcohol flames of the prompt mechanism [11]. Moreover, the lower non-thermal NO concentration detected in the alcohol flames was attributed to the lower contribution of NO formation from NNH and N2O routes up to stoichiometric conditions, and the lower presence of CH radicals at fuel-rich conditions [12]. Therefore, this study aimed to present new accurate experimental data on NO formation in C3 alcohols + air flames. Flames were stabilized on a heat flux burner and quantitative NO concentrations were measured in the post-combustion zone by means of saturated laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The non-intrusive LIF technique results in increased reliability of experimental data, which allows avoiding the difficult quantification of the impact of invasive techniques on experimental uncertainties [11]. Moreover, new laminar burning velocity (LBV) data of propyl alcohols + air mixtures obtained with the heat flux method were also presented. The heat flux method permits an accurate LBV determination which in turn enables a proper evaluation of the chemical time scales of the fuel mixtures, then allowing a direct comparison of NO formed via the thermal route with kinetic predictions, contrary to the methods employed in previous studies, [9,11,12]. In addition, a new detailed kinetic mechanism of C3 alcohol isomers combustion along with a NOx chemistry subset was also proposed. Experimental data on LBV of propyl alcohols + air flames and NO concentration were used to assess the proposed kinetic mechanism, as well as available models from the literature, i.e., Bohon et al. [11] and POLIMI [13,17 19] kinetic mechanisms."
1,Experimental,"In this study, the heat flux method and the LIF technique were employed to measure the NO formation in propyl alcohols + air flames at 1 atm, over the equivalence ratios ϕ = 0.7–1.4. For the experimental quantification, the height above the burner (HAB) was set to 10 mm (post-flame region); this choice, as already previously observed by Konnov et al. [20], ensures that no air entrainment and/or conductive and convective heat losses may affect NO formation. The test fuels were provided by Alfa Aesar with stated high-purity (99+% for 1-propanol and 99.5% for 2-propanol), while the oxidizer (synthetic air) was provided by AGA with the following composition: 21% O2, 79% N2. The unburned mixture temperature was set to 323 K for both fuel mixtures and its overall accuracy was estimated to be better than ± 1 K. The heat flux method allows the stabilization of a flat premixed flame on a perforated burner under near-adiabatic conditions. Such conditions occur when the heat losses needed to stabilize the flame on the burner plate are compensated by the heat received by the inlet gases flowing through the preheated burner plate. Specifically, the burner plate consists of a perforated brass matrix (0.5 mm) with a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 2 mm, secured with thermal paste to the burner head. This latter is kept at a constant temperature of 368 K by a heating jacket supplied with thermostatic water; the plenum chamber is further supplied with a dedicated water heating system, to set to the initial fresh gas temperature. A mixing panel is used to control the flows of the vaporized fuel and the oxidizer, to set the proper equivalence ratio. Liquid fuel flow from the fuel reservoir, pressurized by nitrogen, is controlled through a liquid mass flow controller (Cori-Flow, Bronkhorst High-Tech) and is fed to a Controlled Evaporator Mixer (Bronkhorst High-Tech). Besides, the oxidizer flow is used as a carrier gas to facilitate fuel vaporization. A heating hose, set to the initial temperature conditions (323 K), is used to carry the fuel + air mixture to the burner, with the aim to prevent undesirable condensation. A full method description, as well as of the experimental setup and the data processing procedures, is given in [21]. Measurements of NO concentration were performed by the LIF technique and a thorough description of the employed method is available in our recent work [22]; however, a short description is given below. An Nd:YAG + dye laser system was employed for excitation of NO in the A2Σ+←X 2Π (0–0) band at wavelength 225.5 nm, and the fluorescence was detected in the (1–0) vibrational band around wavelength 236 nm. Measurements were made at irradiances high enough to approach saturated LIF conditions where the signal becomes insensitive to laser irradiance. Quantitative measurements were obtained by calibration versus the NO signal measured in a lean calibration flame seeded with controlled amounts of NO. For proper conversion of the signals into concentrations, data evaluation also needed to consider differences in temperature and concentrations of major species in the flames to account for differences in gas density and molecular collisions, the latter resulting in non-radiative de-excitation of NO thus competing with the fluorescence emission."
2,Modeling details,"The current combustion mechanism, hierarchically structured, consists of 203 species and 2295 reactions and is based on the recently proposed propanol mechanism provided by Capriolo and Konnov [23] in which important modifications introduced by Konnov [24] were implemented, namely the integration of the termolecular reactions associated to hydrogen oxidation, i.e., H + O2+R suggested by Klippenstein and Burke [25,26]; furthermore, transport properties were updated using calculations of Jasper et al. [27,28]. The proposed kinetic model was tested against large literature datasets for propanol isomers obtained at different combustion regimes (e.g. ignition delay times, well-stirred and flow reactors, flame structure) and good agreement in reproducing experimental values was found. The implemented NOx chemistry is based on the Konnov subset [29], to which several modifications and updates have been introduced. Specifically, reactions pertinent to NO chemistry (chemistry of NOx) have been revisited by Volkov et al. [30]. Moreover, the rate constant of the key thermal-NO reaction N2+O⇔NO+N was also updated adopting the expression of Abián et al. [31]. New thermodynamic data [32] were implemented for NH, NH2, NNH, HNO, HONO, HNOH, H2NO, NH2OH, NO3, HNO3, N2O4, N2H2, and N2H3. The other combustion mechanisms used for kinetic assessments include the one of Bohon et al. [11] in which, as previously described, the NOx sub-schemes from GDFkin 3.0 [15,16] are incorporated in the Aramco 1.3 [13] hydrocarbon mechanism. In addition, the POLIMI mechanism, in turn, based on the Aramco 1.3 [13] mechanism and extended to include C3 alcohols and NOx chemistry from [17,18] and [19], respectively, have been investigated. The Cantera software [33] was used to model adiabatic, one dimensional and freely propagating flames of propanols + air mixtures at atmospheric pressure. Multicomponent transport, thermal diffusion (Soret effect), as well as radiative heat losses, i.e., radiation from CO2 and H2O through an optically thin medium, were enabled for the calculations. Simulation convergence was achieved setting the adaptive grid parameters gradient and curvature both to 0.1. To match the simulated distances of the free flame with the corresponding experimental ones, the point of HAB=0 mm was set at the distance for which the burner head temperature (368 K) was achieved."
3,Results and discussion,"Figure 1 depicts measured and simulated concentrations of NO at HAB=10 mm (post-combustion zone), for propyl alcohols + air mixtures; the experimental accuracy related to the NO quantification procedure is ±8.7%; further details regarding its evaluation method are available in our recent work [22]. Simultaneously with NO quantification, LBVs measurements for C3 alcohols were also performed. At the investigated conditions and for both fuel + air mixtures, the peak in NO formation was located at the stoichiometric condition where the maximum flame temperature is reached and the thermal-NO contribution becomes more prominent. Particularly, a comparative analysis performed with the proposed kinetic model showed that, at stoichiometric conditions, the flame temperature for n-propanol + air mixture is ∼12 K higher than for its structural isomer and this, in turn, corroborate the higher value of the thermal-NO concentration found for n-propanol (∼10%), see Fig. 1. However, due to the propensity to form stable intermediates, i-propanol showed lower LBV values than n-propanol (by ∼8%), and so the longer residence time might have partially mitigated the difference in NO formation between the two isomers. At fuel-rich conditions, the non-negligible NO concentration is directly ascribable to the presence of the CH radical, playing a key role in the Fenimore's prompt-NO formation [34–36]. Moreover, one may note that from Φ=1.2, the NO production in i-propanol flames became higher than the one observed in n-propanol flames; this interesting aspect will be discussed following the comparative analysis of the kinetic models. One may note that, at the investigated conditions, NO concentrations in both alcohol isomer flames were similar and the differences are within overlapping error bars; however, such errors are systematic and therefore they do influence each measurement in the same way, which allows discerning the different NO formation patterns and trends in the propyl alcohols flames. At the tested conditions, the overall NO formation profiles from propanols + air flames are captured by the present model, while the Bohon mechanism fails in representing the experimental trend, especially at fuel-rich conditions. One may note that, as also previously observed, the Bohon model performances notably underestimate experimental results [12]. Perceivably, the present model tended to slightly and systematically overestimate the experimental results, while the POLIMI model had a closer agreement in reproducing NO formation in the thermal region (for Φ≤1.0). However, the POLIMI model showed a qualitative minimum in NO formation at fuel-rich conditions that were not spotted neither in the experimental data nor in the current model. Furthermore, the present and POLIMI mechanisms predicted the onset of a second peak in the prompt-NO region at Φ=1.45 which has not been possible to verify through the experimental observations. The reason could be the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities for Φ>1.4 that prevented a proper stabilization of the flame on the burner plate. Also, both the present and the POLIMI mechanisms are capable to reproduce the higher NO production in i-propanol flames experimentally observed in the prompt region; on the contrary, such behavior is not captured by the Bohon mechanism. Figures 2 and 3 depict the LBV measurements for C3 alcohol isomers performed, as mentioned, during the NO concentration measurements. In particular, Bohon and POLIMI models accurately reproduce the experimental data, showing very similar performances, as a consequence of the same core model shared. Therefore, the major differences in the predicted thermal-NO between the two literature models are attributable only to their different NOx subsets, as both models predict similarly the formation of the pool of reactive radicals, as well as the residence time, this latter also influencing NO production. On the contrary, even if the present model shows an overall good agreement in reproducing LBV of both fuel mixtures, it slightly underestimates the experimental results around stoichiometric conditions by ∼1.5 cm/s. Sensitivity analysis allows identifying the most important reactions governing the NO formation/consumption, as well as to highlight the difference among model behaviors. Figures 4 –9 depict the sensitivity coefficients, simulated with the present and literature models, for NO concentration in the propanols flame at HAB=10 mm, at Φ=1.0 and Φ=1.3. For both of the fuels, mechanisms predictions showed that NO formation at stoichiometric conditions is dictated by the Zel'dovich reaction N+NO⇔N2+O and by the branching reaction H + O2⇔OH+O. The present model also shows a large positive sensitivity to the formation of NO via the NNH route, i.e., NNH+O⇔NH+NO. This reaction, however, does not have the same relevance for the other tested models and played a key role in the higher NO formation predicted by the current model in comparison with the POLIMI mechanism. Additionally, a minor effect in thermal-NO over predictions by the present model can be also associated with the lower LBV predicted around stoichiometric conditions (Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, since, as mentioned, both the POLIMI and Bohon models have similar combustion time scales when their predicted LBV were compared (Figs. 2 and 3), their difference in the predicted NO concentration in the thermal region is then mainly due to the different reaction rates implemented for of N+NO⇔N2+O. Precisely, both models show similar performance when the reaction rate of N+NO⇔N2+O from the POLIMI mechanism is replaced into the Bohon mechanism (see Fig. S1). At Φ=1.30 the most important reactions promoting NO formation are related to the prompt-NO route as well as to the key radicals CH and triplet methylene (CH2). Particularly, all tested models consider that the reaction CH+N2⇔NCN+H governs the initial step in the prompt-NO formation. Moreover, only the present model shows sensitivity, as inhibitory reaction steps, to the scission of the hyperconjugated Cα-H bond by the H atom of the two alcohol isomers, i.e., NC3H7OH+H⇔CH3CH2CHOH+H2 and (CH3)CHOH+H⇔(CH3)2COH+H2. For the specific case, POLIMI and Bohon models share the rate constant expression for the reaction CH+N2⇔NCN+H, while the current model considers it lowers by a factor of 0.45. Thus, the main distinctions between the two literature mechanisms are attributable to the diverse reactions pertinent to the formation/consumption of the CH radical, and then to the propyl alcohols sub-mechanism, since both models share the same core (Aramco 1.3). To confirm such a statement, Fig. 10 depicts CH profiles at Φ=1.3 simulated with the tested models. The CH simulation results reflect the simulated trend observed for NO formation in the prompt zone, and the low NO prediction of the Bohon model is, as stated, largely dependent on the lower amount of CH radical predicted. To summarize, all the tested models, albeit in different ways, need to be improved to better reproduce NO production in propyl alcohols flames, restating the importance of the provided experimental data to further ameliorate the knowledge about kinetics of NO formation. With the purpose to elucidate the peculiarity of the higher NO concentration in fuel-rich i-propanol flames, the rate of production analysis (ROP) of NO was performed for both C3 alcohol fuels with the current model, at Φ=1.3 (Fig. 11 ) and at the maximum value of CH mole fraction. It was found, for both isomers, that the most important reactions involve a competition between the reburning and formation mechanisms. Specifically, as already highlighted in [11], the NO-HCN reburning sub-mechanism plays a fundamental role, contributing to NO depletion via the reaction HCCO+NO⇔HCNO+CO. Subsequently, a noticeable amount of isocyanic acid is reconverted to NO via the reaction HCNO+OH⇔NO+CH2O. Moreover, other important reactions involved in NO consumption and formation are, respectively, the metathesis reaction CH+NO⇔HCN+O and the reaction N+OH⇔NO+H. In particular, the effects of the reburning and the formation competition lead to a general slowdown via the prompt-NO pathway, more pronounced in n-propanol flames in which the amount of HCCO produced was found higher by approximately 10% (Fig. 11). Specifically, the oxidative process of the primary alcohol leads to the formation of propanal, CH3CH2CHO, and subsequently, via unimolecular dissociation, to ethyl (C2H5) and formyl (HCO) radicals, favoring the HCCO formation process via the ethylene (C2H4) and the acetylene (C2H2) routes. On the contrary, the i-propanol oxidation pathway involves the formation of the acetyl radical (CH3CO) via unimolecular dissociation of acetone CH3COCH3, which in turn dissociates to produce CH3 and carbon monoxide (CO), disfavoring the formation of C2H4 and C2H2 leading to the HCCO production (Figs. S3 and S4). In summary, the structural configuration of the primary alcohol implies that in the oxidation process more CHx and HCCO radicals are formed, compared to the branched alcohol; this aspect enhances the formation and depletion of NO via the prompt-NO and reburning-NO routes, respectively. This peculiarity leads, as a final result, to a reduced NO formation in n-propanol + air flames at fuel-rich conditions."
4,Conclusions,"The heat flux method and saturated LIF technique were used to provide new accurate quantitative NO measurements, in the post-combustion zone, of propyl alcohols flames. A new kinetic mechanism was also proposed, assessed against experimental data and its performance compared with literature mechanisms, namely the POLIMI and Bohon models. Besides, LBV measurements were performed to check the predicted residence time of the fuel mixtures from the tested models. Higher NO formation in the thermal region was found in n-propanol flames due to its intrinsic higher reactivity; on the contrary, in the fuel-rich zone the major NO production was detected in i-propanol flames. ROP analysis performed at Φ=1.3 with the proposed model revealed that prompt-NO formation was scaled by the NO-HCN reburning route, via the reaction HCCO+NO⇔HCNO+CO. Such effect was more pronounced in n-propanol flames, since HCCO production was favored in the oxidative process of the primary alcohol. Overall, models comparison revealed that, as expected, the distinct simulated results in the thermal and prompt regions are principally attributable, respectively, to the key Zel´dovich and Fenimore reactions employed. The Bohon and POLIMI models did not represent experimental data satisfactorily, while the present model reproduced the kinetics of NO formation with the closest fidelity. However, further adjustments in the present model are needed to better match experimental data, especially at fuel-rich conditions. To conclude, we believe that the new accurate experimental data provided will be of great help to further refine combustion mechanisms."
