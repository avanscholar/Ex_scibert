0,Introduction,"Semiconductor photocatalysis is inevitable to play a vital role towards the generation of hydrogen from water [1]. After the discovery of photocatalytic water splitting using porous TiO2 in 1972 by Honda and Fujishima [2], substantial efforts have been made in order to design highly photoactive semiconductor photocatalysts, which are highly useful in solar energy conversion and environmental pollution protection [3]. Various strategies have been employed in designing semiconductor photocatalysts either by increasing the surface-area, harvesting a wider-portion of the visible light from the solar spectrum [4–5]. Among all these semiconductors, porous TiO2 possess a most promising role in photo-reduction of water due to its low toxicity, chemical inertness, reproducibility, and recyclability with a bandgap of 3.2 eV, but the inherent disadvantage of porous TiO2 is the low quantum efficiency and trifling utilization of the visible light [6,7]. Nickel oxide (NiO) is a p-type semiconductor possessing high electron transfer properties, improved nontoxicity and conductivity of oxygen ions, chemical stability and excellent electron transfer properties, and a wider bandgap of 3.55 eV [8,9]. It has achieved increasing attention due to its various applications in catalysis [10], electrochemical studies and solar cells [11], etc., Graphene oxide possess layers of sp2 bonded carbon atom tightly bonded, which possess outstanding optoelectronic properties [12,13], their high surface area, chemical stability, and high electrical conductivity helps in the construction of hybrid photocatalysts. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) possesses good electrical conductivity and high electron mobility [14,15]. The delocalized conjugated system in graphene can efficiently accept and transfer electrons to the reaction interface and extremely high surface area [16], high work function, suitable oxidation level, it may act as a photosensitizer to extend the absorption of light owing to its aromatic macromolecules or after tuning of the bandgap [17]. The synthesis of the NiO/rGO composites has been involved so far with different studies of photo-degradation and the NiO/TiO2 (NPT) composite in hydrogen production [18–20]. Upon sunlight irradiation, semiconductor harvest light and electrons are transferred via the conduction band (CB), reaching a state of charge separation. The reduction and oxidation half reactions occur at the excited catalytic centres, to which the charge carriers migrate from the initial site. Pioneering studies of photocatalytic H2 generation and reduction of CO2 manifest that TiO2, as a promising candidate for photocatalysis, can uncover a new avenue for developing a heterogeneous photocatalytic system mainly due to its low cost, high photoactivity, good stability and easy fabrication. Recently, TiO2 has become the hot spot for solar energy conversion [21–23]. The formation of p-n heterojunctions has been proven to be one of the most interesting strategies for the production of low-cost and efficient visible light photocatalysts [27–34]. On the other hand, rational combination of TiO2 with other metal oxide semiconductors by altering the band gaps of the hybrids can boost visible light adsorption and increase the exciton separation efficiency [35,36]. When a p-n junction is formed by an n-type TiO2 and p-type metal oxide semiconductor, an inner electric field is created at the p-n junction interface where the p-type metal oxide region accumulates negative charges and the n-type TiO2 region accumulates positive charges. The photogenerated holes will be transferred to the p-type metal oxide valence band under light irradiation, and the photogenerated electrons will be transferred to the conduction band of TiO2. NiO/TiO2 hybrids have gained more interest among those of TiO2-based p-n heterojunctions because NiO has unique properties of usually high hole mobility [37–39]. Previous studies have shown that NiO can be considered as one of the most powerful co-catalysts to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 [40–42], and NiO/ TiO2 p-n heterojunctions with mesoporous hollow nanostructures due to their high specific surface area and more accessible active sites have shown elevated photocatalytic activity [43]. The inherent poor conductivity of metal oxide semiconductors, however, hinders the efficient transfer of excitons, leading to photocatalytic operation of NiO/TiO2 p-n heterojunctions to be further improved [24–26]. The usages of the dyes and pigments in various industries have been highly preferable to induce precise colors to the manufactured products in biological laboratories for analytical purposes and strains. The mixing of the Rhodamine B dye into the aquatic conditions results in high toxicity and low transparency of the wastewater, which irritates the eyes, skin, and respiratory system, which is carcinogenic and toxic to the reproductive and nervous system. Therefore, removing these contaminants from wastewater is highly necessary before releasing them into natural channels to protect both the environment and human beings [27,28]. Here, we elucidate the design, different characteristic properties, optical and electrochemical properties of a novel RGNPT −7.5Wt%. This heterostructured composite is highly useful in enhancing the electron/hole pair separation and charge recombination studies. The RGNPT −7.5Wt% has resulted in higher hydrogen generation efficiency of 8215 µmolg−1 and degradation efficiency of 88% after 180 min of light irradiation at 3 ppm concentration and pH-3. This work may pave the way for developing cost-effective heterostructured photocatalysts for renewable energy conversion applications."

The contact between the titanium isopropoxide (TIP) droplets on ammonia solution, a white precipitate will form immediately. After 1hr, the precipitates were filtered and washed 4 to 5 times with distilled water to obtain pH 7. The sample is left to dry on filter paper for 24 h. The sample was calcined at temperature (i.e., 500 °C for 5 h) at a low heating rate (5 °C per min) to explore changes in properties and catalytic activities [29]."
3,Preparation of NiO,"2.2 Preparation of NiO 1:4 molar ratio of nickel nitrate hexahydrate to urea. The accurate amount of Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O (0.08 mmol) and Urea (0.32 mmol) was taken in 80 mL of deionized water. The two prepared solutions were mixed in a beaker and stirring magnetic conditions at room temperature to an obtained homogeneous solution. Then the mixture was transferred into a round bottom flask, sealed, reflux method was maintained over the reaction and heating at 115 °C for 1.5 h in an oil bath. In this process, a light green precipitate (i.e., the precursor) was formed. After the reaction was completed, kept it to cool at room temperature and the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol to get neutral and colorless. The precipitate dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h, the precipitated powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 400 °C temperature for 1 h at (5 °C /min) to obtain the products in dark color NiO nanoparticles [30]."

The nominal molar ratios of Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2) 0.1 M, 0.5 M, 1.0 M were taken in a certain volume of 0.05 M Ni(NO3)2 aqueous solution. 100 mg of prepared porous TiO2 was dispersed in the above aqueous solution; mixed solutions were taken in the round bottom flask and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. After the reaction was completed, the precipitates were collected by centrifuge and washed with distilled water and alcohol 4 to 5 times, respectively. The washed precipitates were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The dried powder was calcined at 400 °C for 5 h [31]."
5,Preparation of RGNPT,"2.4 Preparation of RGNPT RGNPT was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. A desirable amount of GO (0.05, 0.075, and 0.1 g GO for 5, 7.5, and 10 Wt%, respectively) was dissolved in a mixture containing 20 mL DI water and 40 mL absolute ethanol, and this solution was sonicated for 1 h. Then, 0.1 g of NiO and 0.9 g porous TiO2 (10% NiO:90% porous TiO2) were added to the prepared mixture and sonicated for another 2 h to attain a homogeneous suspension. The attained suspension was transferred to 100 mL Teflon sealed hydrothermal autoclave and maintained the temperature at 120 °C for 3 h to develop the nanocomposite of rGO, NiO, and porous TiO2. The achieved nanocomposite was centrifuged and washed with ethanol 5 times and dried at room temperature [7]."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic hydrogen production RGNPT at variance in graphene oxide (5, 7.5, 10 Wt%), and variance in Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (0.1 M, 0.5 M, 1 M) have been carried out in a Pyrex glass double-walled photoreactor which is fitted with air tight rubber septum at the top portion. In all experiments, 20 mg of the catalyst, with 18 mL of deionized water and 2 mL of Methanol as SED, have been taken. The degassing and insertion of the inert atmosphere (N2) have been carried out for a period of 30 min through this portion of the reactor. Then the reactor is kept under a 450 W Xe arc lamp light irradiation (Newport Co., Ltd., USA and working at 400 W) with constant stirring. The evolved H2 gas was analyzed at a periodic interval (every hour) using gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer Clarus 590 GC containing molecular Sieve/5 Å column) with a thermal conductivity detector using N2 as a carrier gas."
7,Photo degradation experiment,"2.6 Photo degradation experiment The photo-degradation experiments of all the catalysts were performed in aqueous solutions prepared using deionized water in order to prevent any ion interference during the reaction. The degradation efficiency of the as-synthesized photocatalysts has been analyzed using (Rh-B) as the industrial organic contaminant [32]. The stock solution of Rh-B was prepared with a concentration of 1 g/L, from this, different variations of the concentrations such 1 ppm, 2 ppm, 3 ppm, etc., have been prepared. 40 mg of the photocatalyst has been added to 100 mL of the Rh-B solution at 3 ppm concentration. The reaction was kept for 30 min under dark to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. The photocatalytic degradation reaction has been initiated by exposing the solutions to a tungsten lamp. At specific time intervals, 5 mL of solution was taken to determine Rh-B concentration and the absorption capacity. The Rh-B concentrations and absorption capacity of the samples were measured using UV-Spectrophotometer to record the specific absorption λmax (maximum absorption wavelength). The degradation efficiency was calculated through the following equation: Degradation efficiency = C 0 − C C 0 × 100 Where, C0 and C denote the Rh-B concentrations ate initial time and sampling time."
8,Photoelectrochemical studies,"2.7 Photoelectrochemical studies The PEC (Photoelectrochemical) measurements were conducted in a three-electrode system using a potentiostat (CH Instrument, CHI 6005E) with the Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the sample modified ITO film photoanode was used as the working electrode. The working photoanode was prepared by drop-casting of the viscous suspension of each sample separately on ITO film of 2 × 2 cm2 surface area. 5 mg of each catalyst was dispersed into a suspension that contained 500 µmol ethanol and 20 µmol Nafion by 30 min of ultrasonication. Before measurement, the as-prepared samples of porous TiO2, NPT, and RGNPT-7.5Wt% were dried at 100 °C for 0.5 h to evaporate the solvent. The working electrodes were illuminated from the front side with simulated sunlight with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G, 100 mWcm−2 filter. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at an open-circuit voltage and at a potential frequency range of 100 000−0.1 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The collected EIS data was fitted to the equivalent circuit model using the Z View software."
9,Results and discussion,"To synthesize the RGNPT composite, we have used different methods such as self-formation, precipitation, and hydrothermal methods. A robust and easy synthesis process has been carried out in order to enhance the efficiency of the photocatalyst in photocatalytic reactions and dye degradation for the treatment of industrial wastewater into useful fluids."
10,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization X-Ray Diffraction of porous TiO2 was successfully prepared by the facile self-formation process using TIP precursors. The phase composition and crystallinity of the porous TiO2 have been studied by powdered X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1 ) have shown the diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 25.5°, 38.0°, 48.2°, 54.0°, 55.2°, and 64.7°, representing the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211) and (204) phase structures of the anatase porous TiO2 nanoparticles (JCPDS 21–1272) respectively [33]. The obtained 2θ values are similar to porous TiO2. The sharp peak at 25.5° of the porous TiO2 sample is indicating good crystallinity than porous TiO2. For the XRD patterns of NiO the 2θ peaks at 37.0°, 43.10°, 62.8°, 75.23°, 79.12° respectively. With the introduction of NiO and rGO improves the composition with decreasing band gap shows better absorption. In the XRD patterns of the RGNPT-7.5Wt% nanocomposite, no peaks were detected from the rGO surface, indicating that oxide. The diffraction peaks obtained for RGNPT-7.5Wt% are 25.25°, 38.0°, 48.12°, 54.0°, 55.23°, 62.94°, 75.14° were sharper, reflecting better crystallinity. The structural and morphological studies reveal the formation of the anatase phase of the porous TiO2, and the change in the morphological features of the composite after the rGO and NiO loading as shown in Fig. 2 and the formation of the highly porous TiO2 and its conversion into the heterostructured composite has been confirmed using the FE-SEM analysis as shown in Fig. 2(a). The TEM analysis of the as-synthesized composite confirms the formation of heterostructured nanoparticles where the d values of 0.25 nm, 0.24 nm, and 0.354 nm are obtained for the rGO, NiO, and porous TiO2 nanoparticles which attributed to (002) plane of rGO, (111) plane of NiO, and (101) plane of porous TiO2 respectively [20], as shown in Fig. 2(b, c& d). The presence of these elements has been depicted in S1 and S2. The TEM images further confirm the presence of three distinct phases of NiO nanoparticles in the inner layer and rGO nanosheets at the interface with the porous TiO2 porous nano particles at the outer layer."
11,BET analysis,"3.2 BET analysis The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis of the porous TiO2, NPT, and the RGNPT-7.5Wt% samples have been carried out, which reveals that the doping of the NiO on the porous TiO2 has increased the surface area from 45.65 m2/g to 90.10 m2/g with a decrease in pore diameter from 18.2 nm to 11.752 nm, but the doping of the rGO has completely decreased the surface area to 28.101 m2/g which are tabulated below. This decrease in the surface area has enhanced the hydrogen generation efficiency of the RGNPT-7.5Wt% composites. The Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the composites are shown in Fig. 3 (a & b), and its BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) plots and the values have been shown in Table 1 . It was reported, that the thermal/chemical reduction process when employed to reduce GO to rGO, the restoration of their π-conjugated structures completely not occurred. It was also seen that the rGO sheets tend to agglomerate due to the strong π-π interactions among the adjacent layers during the reduction process, which thereby decreases the specific surface area and their corresponding doping with the NiO and TiO2 over the RGNPT-7.5Wt% composite. The Optical properties of as-prepared photocatalyst were analyzed by UV-DRS spectrophotometer. Fig. 4 (a) represents the UV visible absorption spectra of porous TiO2, RGNPT in variation in Nickel and graphene oxide within the range of 250 – 800 nm. All the samples had vivid absorption in the UV light area (250–800 nm), indicating activation in this region. The RGNPT (GO-7.5Wt%) composite shows enhanced absorption intensity, the loading of GO content changes the catalyst from light to dark in color, leading to intense absorption, which further is expected to enhance the photocatalytic performance in the hybrid systems. Fig. 4(b) represents the Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of TiO2, NPT, and RGNPT-7.5Wt%. The presence of characteristic peaks at 1626 and 3418 to 3445 cm−1 confirms that the rGO is successfully assembled on the NPT composite and the formation of the RGNPT-7.5Wt%. Fig.S3 clearly envisage the band gap of all prepared catalysts using tauc plot indicating the decrease in the band gap of the as synthesized materials confirming the efficiency of light absorption and thereby enhancing the electron generation potentials. The elements and their valance states are examined using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectrum of the rGO/NiO/TiO2 (RGNPT-7.5Wt%) heterostructures (Fig. 5 ) reveals the constitution of C, O, Ni, and Ti, respectively in the absence of contaminants. As shown in Fig. 5(a-d) the XPS bands were deconvoluted, the C 1 s core level at 284.655 eV, 286.174 eV and 288.454 eV [21], O 1 s core levels 531.029 eV, 532.169 eV and 530.134 eV, 2p of Ti at 458.917 eV, 464.465 eV and 854.819 eV, 972.591 eV of 2p core level of Ni respectively."
12,Water reduction reaction,"3.3 Water reduction reaction In order to demonstrate the enhanced photocatalytic property of the various composites synthesized, the hydrogen evolution has been measured during the photocatalytic water reduction process. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), 6(b) and 6(c), the RGNPT with 7.5Wt% has resulted in higher hydrogen evolution rate of 2053 µmolg−1h−1, and their hydrogen evolution activity has been tabulated in Table 2 . This value is significantly higher than the other photocatalysts so far synthesized; this emphasizes the pivotal role played by the rGO layer at the interface between both semiconductors. The reduced graphene play an important role in water reduction process since it increases the electron mobility across the photoelectron transfer process as well as enhances the interaction with the water which are prerequisite for the H2 generation occurring in aqueous solution. The comparison of its activity with the as reported photocatalysts so far has been tabulated in Table 3 . To investigate the effects of the addition of NiO and rGO sheets to porous TiO2, the photocurrent generated as a function of applied potential, i.e., linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), was also assessed at a scan rate 50 mVs-1under dark and the illumination of simulated solar light, and the results for porous TiO2, NPT and RGNPT-7.5Wt% are depicted as shown in Fig. 7(a), under identical experimental parameters, RGNPT-7.5Wt% demonstrated a higher current (0.17 μAcm−2) than NPT (0.16 μAcm−2) and bare porous TiO2 (0.14 μAcm−2) composites. The superior photocurrent activity shows that the RGNPT-7.5Wt% composite has a strong ability to generate and transport the photoexcited charge carriers under the illumination of simulated solar light [15]. The obtain results consistent with the photochemical hydrogen generation and time-resolved PL spectra."
13,Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS),"3.4 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further employed to support the fast charge transport properties and higher separation efficiency of this photoanode (porous TiO2, NPT, and RGNPT-7.5Wt%). Fig. 7(b) depicts the EIS measurements on RGNPT-7.5Wt%, NPT and porous TiO2 at a potential of – 5.0 mV over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. In order to gain deeper insights about the charge transfer efficiency of the composites, the NPT and porous TiO2 shows larges arc radius thereby more resistance and less photocurrent compared to RGNPT-7.5Wt%. Moreover, EIS also confirmed that RGNPT-7.5Wt% heterostructure possesses lowest charge transfer resistance enlightening that heterostructure could significantly accelerate the electron mobility compared to NPT and bare porous TiO2 [42]."
14,Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectra,"3.5 Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectra To understand the charge-pair recombination studies, the Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) analysis of the two photocatalysts Porous TiO2 and RGNPT-7.5Wt%, have been carried out, the results as expected supports superiority in photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical porous TiO2 based ternary composite. These tri and tetra-exponential functions are used to fit parameters, as shown in Fig. 8 . The average lifetime of the porous TiO2 was found to be 0.1 ns, and that of the RGNPT-7.5Wt% was about 3.21 ns, and their values obtained have been tabulated in Table S1. The previous studies in our group as well as from the literatures, we have seen hierarchical porous TiO2 showed effective photon harvesting than the conventional TiO2. The HPT possesses high surface area and due to presence of ordered macro- or mesoporous TiO2 network with accessible and open pores with limited crystal defects it facilitates low recombination process of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the photocatalytic cycle, also it enhances the efficiency of photoabsorption and improves the mass transfer process. In this work, we have shown the superiority of charge carrier dynamics of the materials. The decay kinetics of RGNPT-7.5Wt% exhibits a longer average lifetime (3.21 ns) indicating effective separation of photoinduced electrons and holes during photocatalytic process [45]."
15,Effect of operational factors for degradation of rhodamine B,"3.6 Effect of operational factors for degradation of rhodamine B 3.6.1 Effect of GO content The photocatalytic performance of porous TiO2, NPT, RGNPT-7.5Wt% nanocomposites was inquired to find at which of the nanocomposite is showing more degradation efficiency in the presence of visible light irradiation at Rh-B concentration of 5 ppm. Rhodamine B degradation of porous TiO2 was 26% showing less decontamination of Rh-B due to high e/h recombination rate and wide band gap value. Also, with the loading of NiO on porous TiO2, the photo-degradation efficiency increased from 26 to 31%. The photo-degradation rate of all RGNPT nano composites, indicating that the addition of GO content enhanced the degradation efficiency under visible light irradiation. By increasing the GO percentage from 5–7.5Wt%, the photocatalytic activity increased from 36–65%. By increasing further weight percentage to 10 the removal rate decreased to 46%, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Graphene oxide can turn the adsorption ability and will decrease the electron-hole recombination ratio. Higher the GO wt% can dissipate the light irradiations and will bring down the available light adsorption surface of RGNPT-7.5Wt%. Consequently, the GO concentration at 7.5Wt% is an optimum concentration of RGNPT nanocomposite. Its calibration curve has been depicted in Fig. 9(a). 3.6.2 Effect of Rhodamine B concentration The effect of Rhodamine B concentration of 1–5 ppm, catalysts dosage of 20 mg/100 mL, the irradiation time of 180 min. Fig. 9(c) and S4 demonstrates the obtained results for different concentrations of Rh-B. The Rh-B degradation efficiency is 51% at 5 ppm; a further decrease of 5 to 1 ppm significantly increased to 92% of removal efficiency. This can be assigned to the fact that the rising of Rh-B concentration and its intermediate by-products deactivates the active sights and decreases the light diffuse to the active sights deposited on the surface of the catalyst, which is creditworthy for developing oxidative radicals. At a high concentration of Rh-B, a major portion of light can be absorbed by Rh-B molecules and their byproducts. This diminishes the photocatalytic activity and lowering the O-, OH.. RGNPT-7.5Wt% showed more photocatalytic activity because it indicated more amounts of decontamination under visible light. RGNPT-7.5Wt% nanocomposite was an efficient catalyst for the degradation of various contaminants. 3.6.3 Catalyst dosage The amount of catalyst dosage has a significant effect on degradation. The effect of pH on the RGNPT photocatalyst was analyzed by varying the dosage. The experiments were performed at pH of 6, catalyst dosage 10–50 mg/100 mL, Rh-B concentration of 3 ppm for 180 min. The degradation rate at catalyst dosage is shown in Fig. 9(d). By increasing the catalyst dosage from 10–40 mg/100 mL resulting in enhancing the photocatalytic degradation rate from 18% to 82% due to more active sites was available and more surface area, the superoxide ions, hydroxyl radicals were generated in this region. The possible mechanism for the degradation studies resulting in a better degradation over the acidic conditions are quietly due to the release of H + through the acidic functional groups of the Rhodamine-B, as the Rh-B tends to exist cationic and monomeric molecular forms the Rh-B+ and can enter the pore structure leading to the interaction with the hydroxyl radicals [43]. Further increase in photocatalytic dosage over 50 mg/100 mL, the photo-degradation rate decreased from 82% to 52%. This could be because of (1) Small pore volume and available surface area of the catalyst, (2) collision between hydroxyl radicals and Rh-B, (3) Extravagant hydroxyl propagation with a higher dosage of catalyst. 3.6.4 Effect of pH Based on studies, the initial pH of a solution is one of the important operational parameters which can influence the degradation rate of organic compounds. pH has a significant influence on the contaminant hydrolysis, and catalysts surface properties, oxidant, and contaminant ionization degree. The experiment was conducted at pH 3, 6, 12, catalyst dosage of 40 mg/100 mL of dye solution, the irradiation time of 180 min and Rhodamine B concentration of 3 ppm. As can be seen in Fig. 9 and Fig. S4 which dropped 88% to 35% with rising pH from 3 to 12. In the acidic range the dye will be in cationic form (Rh-B+) and pH is around 3–4 range. Hence due to electrostatic repulsive forces, the adsorption of the dye on the catalyst is less. Thus the surface promoted degradation is less and the observed degradation is primarily taking place in the solution. At higher pH value, the Rh-B+ gets deprotonated and its zwitter ion is formed. This can get adsorbed onto the negatively charged catalyst surface resulting in increased degradation of the dye. Further, under alkaline conditions, leads to the abundant formation of OH radical from the hydroxide ions, which also enhances the degradation [44]. This can get adsorbed onto the negatively charged catalyst surface resulting in increased degradation of the dye. Further, under alkaline conditions, more OH radical formation is possible from the abundant hydroxide ions, which also enhances the degradation The above results clearly envisage that the catalyst possesses maximum degradation efficiency of 88% at 40 mg/100 mL of dye solution at pH-3 followed a pseudo-first-order reaction. The photo-degradation of OChlorophenol with the same photocatalyst of TiO2/NiO-rGO (RGNPT-7.5Wt%) was found 88.4% of degradation at 100 mg/L OChlorophenol (100 mL) after 8 h of reaction with the addition of 0.01 mL of H2O2 at pH 6.5 [19]. The mechanistic aspect of the photodegradation studies including the usage of scavengers such as DMSO and Na2SO4 along with the catalyst were studied (Fig. 9(f)). The comparative studies with and without radical scavenger clearly envisage that the degradation efficiency is superior in the RGNPT-7.5Wt% composite without salt and solvent which acts as scavengers for the generation of the hydroxyl radicals."
16,Photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism,"The photocatalytic hydrogen generation mechanism follows the following pathway as depicted in Fig. 10 . The RGNPT-7.5Wt% composite on light irradiation exhibits electrons and leads to the formation of holes, and this involves the excitation of the electrons from the valence bond to the conduction band of porous TiO2, which involves the electrons to the conduction band of the rGO and that further leads to electron transfer to the NiO where the water reduction takes place. The electron-hole recombination takes place by the addition of the methanol as a sacrificial electron donor, which donates electrons, which leads to the higher hydrogen generation activity of the photocatalyst [46]."
17,Conclusion,"In summary, the synthesis of the RGNPT composite has been carried out using a simple hydrothermal process. The as-synthesized RGNPT- 7.5Wt% photocatalyst possesses enhanced light harvesting, efficient charge separation, photo-generated electron-pair recombination, and rapid charge transfer at the interfaces of the hetero junctions contributing to excellent photochemical activity in water reduction and dye degradation. The RGNPT with 7.5Wt% has resulted in higher hydrogen evolution rate of 2053 µmolg−1h−1 and dye degradation efficiency of 88% on optimal conditions of 40 mg/100 mL at 3 ppm concentration at 3 pH and 180 min of light irradiation. This work has depicted promising pathways for designing of novel rGO- based hetero composites for other nanodevices and wastewater treatments."
