0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as one of the clean energy is a suitable energy to solve the energy crisis which is become one of the most serious problem in 21st century. And photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is proved to be an environmentally friendly way to produce hydrogen [1–4]. In past few decades, many researchers used Cadmium sulfide (CdS) as the host material for PHE, because of the band gap (2.4 eV) for visible light absorption and proper conduction and valence band position [5–7]. Moreover, the nanorod structure of CdS combines the advantages of quantum confinement effect and bulk charge transfer, and is beneficial to adjust the band gap structure of the semiconductor while maintaining the original charge transfer model [8]. Unfortunately, the application of pure CdS is still limited by the rapid recombination of photo-induce charge and severe photocorrosion under light irradiation. In order to solve this problem, this work try to support cocatalysts and other semiconductors on CdS. The transition metal sulfide has widely used in the field of photocatalysis due to its excellent electrical conductivity and excellent light absorption properties [9–11]. As a kind of transition metal sulfide, NiS has attracted wide attention because of its ability to improve light absorption and provide abundant active sites. For example, Zhong and co-worker et al. reported that NiS loaded on mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites possess highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution [12]; and Zhang and co-worker et al. reported that NiS can be used as a hole co-catalyst to enhance photocatalytic performance [13]. However, most of the research on the application of NiS in photocatalyst to date only study one of its crystal phase [14–16]. Surendran, S and co-worker et al. are reported the (100) lattice plane of α-NiS is in favor of decomposing H2O into H+ and OH− [17]. Shen, R and co-worker reported β-NiS exhibits better conductive than other phases of nickel sulfide [18]. It is inferred that different crystals of NiS have different effects on photocatalysis. Meanwhile, α-NiS-β-NiS possess excellent stability at any temperature, outstanding visible light absorption ability and abundant active sites for PHE. Therefore, this study integrates the advantages of the two crystal phases by combining different NiS crystal phases for PHE. Although the light absorption ability and insufficient active sites of CdS can be effectively solved by loading the co-catalyst, but its shortcomings of easy aggregation and photocorrosion have not been effectively solved. Recently, the application of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) in photocatalytic has been widely aroused due to its’ high specific surface area, adjustable organic-ligand and metal central and liable to be further modified [19–22]. Also, the modified method of MOF in photocatalytic are diverse, one of the method is constructed heterojunction with other materials [23,24]. For example, Lee et al. and co-worker reported that BiOI/MOF constructed type-Ⅱ heterojunction to enhance photocatalytic performance [25]; Liu et al. and co-worker et al. reported that by constructing a Z-scheme heterojunction between NH2-UiO-66 and Bi2WO6 can effectively improve the removal efficiency of NO [26]. Otherwise, different heterojunction has different charge transfer model, which is play a vital role in improve photocatalytic activity. To explore the influential of organic-ligand to transfer of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, UiO-66 with different organic-ligand loaded on α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS is prepared. The results show UiO-66 with –NH2 can construct Z-scheme with α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS, (OH)2-UiO-66 or UiO-66 can only construct type-Ⅰ heterojunction. Additionally, the morphology of UiO-66 is uniform and the particle size is around 500 nm, which allows CdS nanorods with a length of 200 nm to be well loaded on the surface of NH2-UiO-66, thereby improving the dispersion of CdS. In this work, the UiO-66 with different functional groups was applied to construct heterojunction with α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS, in order to explore the role of functional groups in changing the electron transfer mode of photocatalytic systems. The results shows, Z-scheme is constructed in α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS/NH2-UiO-66 and type-Ⅰ heterojunction is formed in α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS/UiO-66 and α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS/(OH)2-UiO-66. Compared with type-Ⅰ heterojunction, Z-scheme is more conducive to the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs and possess a favorable oxidation and reduction ability, as well as inhibit the photocorrosion of CdS caused by photo-induced holes [27–29]. At the same time, α-NiS-β-NiS as cocatalyst can enhance light absorption ability in visible-light area and provide abundant active sites. As a result, the as-prepared sample show an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen rate of 17.88 mmol h−1 g−1 which is 7.9 times and 2.5 times as high as that of pure CdS (2.27 mmol h−1 g−1) and 7-α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS (7.18 mmol h−1 g−1), and it also show a prominent apparent quantum efficiency of 14.7% (420 nm). Therefore, this work provide a novel photocatalyst system for PHE which possess highly-efficient photo-induced charge separation and excellent visible-light absorption ability and a novel pattern to constructed Z-scheme."

3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Preparation of CdS nanorod The CdS nanorod was prepared according to previous studies [30]. In a typical synthesis progress, 8 mmol (2.946 g) Cd (NO3)2·4H2O and 12 mmol (0.9134 g) CH4N2S were added to 40 mL Ethylenediamine and stirred for 30 min. Then, the resulting solution was transferred to a 100 mL Tefflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and heated at 180 ○C for 24 h. Finally, the as-obtained sample were washed by ethanol and deionized water during the suction filtration, then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. 2.2.2 Preparation of α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS composite α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS was prepared by hydrothermal method. 0.22 mmol Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 2 mmol CH4N2S and 0.2890 g CdS nanorod were added to 35 mL deionized water. Then, the above mixture was ultrasound 10 min then stirred for another 30 min. Then, the mixed solution was transferred to a 50 mL Tefflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, then heated at 140 °C for 4 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the solid samples were washed by ethanol and deionized water during the suction filtration, then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The obtained product NiS: CdS is 7, and the sample was labeled as CN7. Adjust the addition amount of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O to 0.12, 0.16 mmol and 0.28 mmol respectively to obtain different ratios of NiS: CdS. The samples were labeled as CN3, CN5, CN7, and CN9. The synthesis method of UN, NUN and OUN are familiar with the CN7, which just change CdS to UiO-66 (U), NH2-UiO-66(NU) and (OH)2-UiO-66(OU). 2.2.3 Preparation of 7- α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS/MOF composite CNNU was synthesized by a solvothermal method, 0.15 g CN7, 0.0181 g ZrCl4 and 0.0233 g NH2-BDC (BDC, (OH)2-BDC) were added to a mix solution, which was comprised of 40.8 mL NH2-BDC and 7.2 mL acetic acid.

After mild ultrasound 10 min and stirred for another 10 min, the solid samples were washed by ethanol and deionized water during the suction filtration, then dried in an oven at 60 °C. The samples were labeled as CNNU (CNU, CNOU). By adjusting the CN7 to simple CdS, CdS/MOF was synthesized and labeled as CU, CNU and COU individually (see Scheme 1 )."
4,Physical characterization,"2.3 Physical characterization Crystal phase structure of obtained samples were characterized by powder XRD on Rigaku D/MAX 2500V, the microstructures were detected by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8220), a transition electron microscopy (TEM, FEI TECNAI G2 F30) and a high-resolution transition electron microscopy (HR-TEM, FEI TECNAI G2 F30) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha was used to identify the binding energy of Cd, S, Ni, Zr, C, N and O. FT-IR spectra was detected by Nicolet iS 50 to identify the covalent bond of the sample. The light-absorption ability of the sample was detected by an UV–vis DRS spectrometer (UV–2501PC) with BaSO4 as a background. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS55 with an excitation wavelength at 380 nm."
5,Photoelectrochemical characterization,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical characterization All of the electrochemical characterization of the samples was conducted by a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China), which is consisted by a three-electrode system. Pt foil, ITO coating with sample and calomel electrode were used as the counter electrode, work electrode and reference electrode respectively, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted under the frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz. The light source of Instantaneous photocurrent was a 300 W xenon lamp (λ ≥ 400 nm). Mott-Schottky plots were measured under the frequency of 1000 Hz. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of spin-trapped radicals were obtained using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker A300)."
6,Photocatalytic performance test,"2.5 Photocatalytic performance test Photocatalytic hydrogen production test was conducted in a 230 mL quartz reactor with a 300 W Xe lamp light source combined with a 400 nm cut off filter. Typically, 30 mg photocatalysts were added in 70 mL aqueous solution containing 10% volume ratio lactic acid as sacrificial electron donor. After fed in nitrogen for 30 min, the quartz reactor was put into the photoreactor with stir until the end of reaction. The circulating cooling water was maintained at 25 °C. The generated hydrogen was detected by a gas chromatography (GC-9720). The photocatalytic pollution degradation was test under the 300 W Xe lamp with the 400 nm cut off filter. In brief, 30 mg photocatalyst were added in 80 mL aqueous solution with 20 mg/L alizarin yellow R (AYR). Prior to visible-light irradiation, the solution was stirred under dark for 30 min to achieve equilibrium of adsorption-desorption. During the irradiation time, 0.5 mL was taken at certain intervals (e.g. 0, 10, 30 and 60 min), followed by withdrawn and filtered through 0.22 μm nylon membrane for the purpose of analysis. The active species radical trapping experiment was conducted to verify the mechanism of the hybrid material. Two radical groups (·O2 − and ·OH) were captured by benzoquinone (BQ) and tert butyl alcohol (TBA) in the reaction solution under light irradiation, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency was detected by the same quartz reactor but with a cut off filter of 420 nm. The average irradiation intensity and area were 35.5 mW cm−2 and 17.35 cm2, respectively. The formula of AQE calculate as follow: AQE ( % ) 2 × number of evolved hydrogen molecules number of incident photons"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physical characterization,"3.1 Physical characterization The crystalline structure and phase purity of different as-prepared samples were investigated by powder XRD technique. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the pure CdS sample exhibited seven obvious diffraction peaks, which were corresponded to wurtzite-structure of CdS (indexed to JCPDS No.41–1049) [31]. The XRD pattern of pure UiO-66, (OH)2-UiO-66, NH2-UiO-66 are showed in Fig. 1b, and it is consistent with previous work and the standard card, which confirms that the MOF was synthesized successfully [1,32,33]. For pure α-NiS-β-NiS (Fig. S1b), diffraction peaks were well indexed to β-NiS [34] (indexed to JCPDS No.86–2281) and α-NiS [35] (indexed to JCPDS No.50–1791). However, for binary materials (Fig. S1a) and ternary materials (Fig. 1a) samples, the XRD pattern showed no obvious diffraction peak of MOF and α-NiS-β-NiS, which may be explained as the low content of α-NiS-β-NiS and good distribution of MOF. In addition, the diffraction peak of CdS in CN, CNU, CNNU and CNOU had no obvious shift while combined with α-NiS-β-NiS and MOF, indicating that the addition of MOF and α-NiS-β-NiS had no influence on the crystal structure of CdS nanorod. The existence of NH2-UiO-66 and α-NiS-β-NiS in CNNU can be verified by SEM, TEM and XPS. The morphologies and microstructures of the as-synthesized CdS, NH2-UiO-66, CN7 and CNNU are further characterized by SEM and TEM images. In Fig. 2 a, the pure hexagonal CdS possess uniform rod nanostructure with the size of diameter and length distribution between 10-20 nm and 100–200 nm, respectively. Fig. 2b displays the SEM images of NH2-UiO-66 which exhibits an obvious octahetral structure, and the nanoparticle size of NH2-UiO-66 were around 500 nm, facilitated the attachment of CdS to its surface which was benefit accelerated the electron transfer between CdS and NH2-UiO-66. After composition, CN7 (Fig. 2c) and CNNU (Fig. 2d) can still observe the rod-like structure of CdS, the difference is that CNNU also observes the octahedral NH2-UiO-66. However, the complex neither observed α-NiS-β-NiS nanoparticle which may be attributed to the small size and low content. The more detailed interfacial structure is investigated by TEM image. In the TEM image of CNNU in Fig. 2e, not only the rod-like structure corresponding to CdS and the octahedral NH2-UiO-66 can be observed, but also the granular α-NiS-β-NiS can be seen. Also the good contact interface was formed between the three compositions which was benefiting constructed Z-scheme junction in CNNU. This result was consistent with that observed in SEM. In Fig. 2f, the lattice fringes around 0.35 nm, 0.223 nm and 0.27nm can be indexed to the (002) crystal plane of CdS, the (211) plane of β-NiS and the (002) plane of α-NiS, respectively. To get more information about spatial distribution of different elements, the element composition is also confirmed by the EDX analysis on the selected area. The result shown in Fig. S2 corroborate the existence of the elements Cd, S, Ni, C, N, O and Zr in the CNNU ternary composites. The chemical positions and states were further investigated by XPS. For Cd 3d spectra of as-prepared samples (Fig. 3 a), the peaks at 411.77 and 404.93 eV could be ascribed to Cd2+ [36]. The peaks in S 2p regions at 161.32 and 162.42 eV were assigned to S2− [36]. Interestingly, compare to pure CdS, the Cd 3d and S 2p core lever spectrum of CNNU shifted to higher binding energy, implying the CdS of CNNU has a dense electron density than that of pure CdS [37]. For Ni 2p, as shown in Fig. 3d, two peaks at 856.40 and 874.60 eV were related to the Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+2p1/2 of and another two satellite peaks correspond to the NiS precisely [38]. The C, N, O (Fig. S3) and Zr (Fig. 3c), correspond to the published literatures precisely, which could further confirm the successfully synthesis of NH2-UiO-66 [39]. Moreover, the binding energy of C, N, O and Zr in CNNU is lower than those of pure NH2-UiO-66, which means NH2-UiO-66 of CNNU possess poor electron density than pure NH2-UiO-66 [37]. The up-shift of Cd and S and the down-shift of C, N, O and Zr peaks, indicated the photo-induced electron transferred from NH2-UiO-66 to CdS, were confirmed the Z-scheme junction was successfully constructed in CNNU ternary composite, which would expected to facilitate the photo-induced charges separation and migration, thus enhance the ability of PHE. The optical properties were investigated by UV–vis DRS. The pure CdS (Fig. 4 ) exhibited sharp adsorption band edges at ∼530 nm parallel to the intrinsic adsorption edge of CdS nanorods. However, the α-NiS-β-NiS has no obvious adsorption edges around 200–800 nm, which is one of the main feature of the co-catalyst. Understandably, the existence of α-NiS-β-NiS co-catalyst can enhance the light adsorption of mixture in the visible-light of 540–800 nm as compared with pure CdS, and the increment was more significant in the case of the increase content of α-NiS-β-NiS, which may be resulted to enhance the PHE performance. Comparing with CN and CdS, the introduction of MOF leads to slightly decrease of the absorption ability in visible-light area, but it still has strong light absorption performance compared to pure CdS. Meanwhile, pure UiO-66 NH2-UiO-66 and (OH)2-UiO-66 exhibited adsorption band edges at 325, 445 and 473 nm, respectively."
9,PHE performance,"3.2 PHE performance In order to value the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance with different samples. The photocatalytic experiments were examined in 70 mL aqueous solution containing 10% volume ratio lactic acid as sacrificial electron donor with 30 mg photocatalyst under the visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). As shown in Fig. 5 a, due to the fast recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, there was very low speed of H2 (2.27 mmol h−1 g−1) generation of pure CdS. For CN7, with the assistance by α-NiS-β-NiS cocatalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate is rising up to 7.18 mmol h−1 g−1 which is 3.16 times of that of pure CdS. On the other side, CN3, CN5, CN7 and CN9 (Fig. S6a) all have better performance than pure CdS. This means that loading α-NiS-β-NiS on CdS can indeed effectively improve the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which can be attributed to the terrific light absorption ability and abundant active sites of α-NiS-β-NiS. However, the hydrogen evolution rates of different ratio of α-NiS-β-NiS exhibit the trend of rising up first and then decline, which can be explained by the optical shielding effect that limits the performance of binary material with high content α-NiS-β-NiS [40]. Meanwhile, the PHE efficiency of individual MOF, α-NiS-β-NiS/MOF and CdS/MOF were tested. The PHE of MOF and α, β-NiS/MOF is negligible, which is coincide with previous work [41,42]. Moreover, the PHE efficiency of CdS/MOF is better than CdS and individual MOF (Fig. S6b), which could be attributed to construction of heterogeneous structures. Notabaly, when MOF was further loaded on to CN7 the PHE performance was improved some extent. As shown in Fig. 5a, CNU, CNOU and CNNU exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity with hydrogen evolution rate reaching up to 8.13, 10.07 and 17.88 mmol h−1 g−1. The significant improvement of photocatalytic activity of CNNU may be due to the change of photo-induced electron transfer path. The AQE of CNNU in different wavelength is displayed in Fig. S7 which reveal that the CNNU possess a splendid convert efficiency in visible-light area. The superior performance of CN and CNNU can be ascribed to the improvement of separation of electrons and holes and the better photoelectric effect. In order to verify the stability of CNNU, 10 cycles of PHE were carried out under the same conditions, and each cycle lasted for 5 h. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the photocatalytic ability is decline after 35 h which might be caused by the consumption of sacrifice agent. After adding some sacrificial agents, the photocatalytic performance recovered, which means CNNU possess an outstanding stability. Comparing the XRD pattern (Fig. S6a) of CNNU before and after the reaction, the diffraction peak had no obvious shift and change, which means tha0t after 24 h of reaction, the crystal structure of CNNU did not change. In addition, the SEM pattern (Fig. S6b) after the reaction also showed no obvious changes in morphology. In conclusion, cyclic PHE test, XRD test and SEM test prove that CNNU has good stability. The excellent stability can be attributed to the construction of Z-scheme junction by introduction of NH2-UiO-66."
10,Analysis of photo-induced charge transfer,"3.3 Analysis of photo-induced charge transfer Electrochemical analysis including transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are conducted to verify the ability of electron generation and transfer of different samples. As shown in Fig. 6 a, CN7 exhibits the smallest arc radius when compared and CdS which can be attributed to the high electronic conductivity of α-NiS-β-NiS ensuring the low charge-transfer resistance and fast interfacial electron transfer [43,44]. And the arc radius further decrease after introduction NH2-UiO-66 in CN7. This phenomenon can be explained that the CNNU not only exhibited the feature of loading α-NiS-β-NiS but also possessed better conductivity after introduction of NH2-UiO-66. Furthermore, we tested the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of different composites. In Fig. S7, the composites with α-NiS-β-NiS possess smaller arc radius than single material, which further confirm the function of α-NiS-β-NiS. Meanwhile, the composition of CdS and MOF possess a small arc radius than individual MOF and CdS, which means the heterostructure could be benefit for electron transfer, and the same phenomenon appeared in the comparison of MOF/CN7 and CN7. In Fig. 6b, the transient photocurrent (i-t) curves showed that CNNU could deliver an evidently strengthened photocurrent response than the CdS and CN7, indicated the remarkable ability of generate photo-induced charges and the excellent separation efficiency of electrons and holes due to the enhancement of light adsorption ability and the construction of Z-scheme junction. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density of CNNU were more stable than CdS and CN7, indicated that the Z-scheme junction formed in CNNU was benefited for the stability of this photocatalysis system. Photoluminescence (PL) emission is conducted to prove the separation efficiency of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. The recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs will release the PL emission signal, and the weak emission peak symbolizes that the material has better separation efficiency of photo-induced electron-hole pairs [45]. All the samples are excited by the incident light with the wavelength of 380 nm and the emission peaks are around 572 nm. In Fig. 6c, the PL peak intensity of CN were weak compared to CN, which means the separation efficiency of CN7 was better than CdS due to the loaded of α-NiS-β-NiS, facilitated the migration of photo-induced electrons. In addition, after in-situ growth NH2-UiO-66 on CN7, the emission peak were further weakened due to the Z-scheme junction constructed by introduction of NH2-UiO-66, which is further improving the separation efficiency of photo-induced electron-hole pairs."
11,Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.4 Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The band gaps of CdS and MOF can be calculated from the absorption edge using the Kubelka-Munk equation. Based on the plot of (αhν)2 versus (hv) shown in Fig. 7 a, the band gap of CdS, UiO-66, (OH)2-UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 are 2.35, 3.90, 2.71 and 2.82eV, respectively [1,31]. It’s demonstrated in Fig. 7b that the conduction band (CB) of CdS, UiO-66, (OH)2-UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 are determined using the Mott-Schottky method. The slopes of the Mott-Schottky curves are positive, indicating that the CdS and all of the MOF are n-type semiconductor [46]. The flat potential of CdS, UiO-66, (OH)2-UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 are approximately −1.03, −1.23, −1.06 and −0.92 V vs SCE, respectively. Generally, the bottom of CB in n-type semiconductor is 0.1 smaller than its’ flat band [46], which means the conduction band of CdS, UiO-66, (OH)2-UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 are −0.93, −1.13, −0.96 and −0.82 V (vs NHE) respectively. By combining the results of the band gap values and Mott-schottky curves, the valence band (VB) of CdS, UiO-66, (OH)2-UiO-66 and NH2-UiO-66 are determined to be 1.42, 2.65, 1.66 and 2.04 V, respectively. The Mott-Schottky of different composites also tested. In Fig. S8, all of the curves possess positive slopes that means all of the sample maintain n-type semiconductor which could benefit for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. To confirm and investigate the mechanism of the CNNU photocatalyst system, the ESR spin trap (with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)) was employed. Fig. S9 shows no characteristic peak of ·OH or ·O2 − are observed in CU and CNNU without irradiation. Whereas, strong ESR signals corresponding to the DMPO-·O2 − (Fig. S8a) adduct are clearly observed for both CU and while CNNU under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the DMPO-·OH signals of CN and CNNU also detected under irradiation, but the peaks intensity of DMPO-·OH is not obvious which might be resulted to the VB of NH2-UiO-66 and the neutral solution not conducive to generate abundant ·OH. The above results suggested that CNNU possess the mechanism of Z-scheme systems. The photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted to verify the degradation experience of MOF-derived ternary materials. In Fig. S10a, the degradation efficiency of CNNU is lower than other two materials, which could be attributed to the absorption ability of CNU and CNOU. The degradation and radical trapping experimental were conducted to further verify the Z-scheme in CNNU. The result was depicted in Fig. S10b. Obviously, the degradation rate of AYR of CNNU has achieved 16.78% after 1h the irradiation of light (λ ≥ 420 nm). With the solution injecting benzoquinone (BQ), the degradation rate has obviously degraded. BQ as one kind of ·O2 − trapping agents can prevent ·O2 − react with AYR [47]. Therefore the attenuation phenomenon can be explained that ·O2 − is one of the active species of degradation of AYR. Also, the result of ·OH trapping experimental demonstrated that with the containing of TBA the degradation rate of AYR is improved with the addition of TBA [47], which means the consumption of ·OH is benefit for the degradation of AYR. This phenomenon can be explained by the consumption of ·OH could promote the separation of photo-induced charge which benefit to generate more ·O2 − active species. As reported in preceding text, the conduction band of both CdS and NH2-UiO-66 are satisfy to generate ·O2 − (−0.33 V vs NHE). However, only the valence band of NH2-UiO-66 is satisfy to generate ·OH (1.99 V vs NHE). The degradation mechanism (Fig. S12) is proposed by energy band diagram and previous work [48,49] . Combining with above analysis, the energy band diagram of CNU, CNOU and CNNU is depicted in Scheme 2 , and the energy band diagram of other materials is depicted in Fig. S11. For CNU and CNOU, the conduction band of UiO-66 and (OH)2-UiO-66 both are more negative than CdS, otherwise the valence band of UiO-66 and (OH)2-UiO-66 are more positive than CdS. Under the irradiation of light, the photo-induced electron-hole pairs of UiO-66 and (OH)2-UiO-66 all transferred to conduction band and valence band of CdS, which suggested the type Ⅰ heterojunction was constructed in CNU and CNOU. For CNNU, the electrons of CdS and NH2-UiO-66 will transition from the valence band to the conduction band due to the light irradiation. Combined with XPS, radical trapping experiment and ESR, the electron density of CdS in CNNU is higher than that of pure CdS, which means the electrons are prefer to transfer from NH2-UiO-66 to CdS. And the holes possess opposite trend compared to electrons which could accumulated on VB of NH2-UiO-66. For all this reason, a direct Z-scheme is proposed. Compared to type Ⅰ heterojunction, Z-scheme could limited the photocorrosion of CdS while the photo-induced charge are separate efficiently. Simultaneously, the α-β-NiS can serve as electron acceptor and possess a highly metallic system. So the electron will transferred from CdS to α-β-NiS, and trigger photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, α-β-NiS/CdS/MOF heterostructure photocatalyst has been successfully synthesized. NH2-UiO-66 loaded on α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS could formed Z-scheme which possess a better charge transfer model than α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS/UiO-66 and α-NiS-β-NiS/CdS/(OH)2-UiO-66. The Z-scheme has been confirmed by photocatalytic degradation experience and trapping radical experiments. The α-β-NiS has significantly improved the light absorption ability of pure CdS, therefore more photo-induced electrons generate could be guaranteed, and it could also enhance the transfer motivation of photo-induced electron. The optimal catalyst α,β-NiS/CdS/NH2-UiO-66 exhibits a H2 evolution rate up to 17.88 mmol h−1 g−1 and almost maintains the activity unchanged during the 24 h continuous photocatalytic reaction. This work provides a new insight design a MOF based Z-scheme heterojunction with highly-efficient photo-induced charge separation and excellent visible-light absorption ability."
