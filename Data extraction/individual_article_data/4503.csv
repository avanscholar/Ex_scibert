0,Introduction,"For the evaluation of factors controlling activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts, the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes was applied in numerous studies and recently reviewed [1–4]. Citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) belongs to this class of compounds and is also a valuable intermediate in industrial processes for the synthesis of vitamins, and flavours. Its rather complex hydrogenation network is given in Fig. 1 . Besides the nature of the active metal (e.g. palladium [5], platinum [6,7], gold [8]), further parameters like (i) presence of a second metal (e.g. rhodium–tin [9,10], nickel–tin [11], silver–indium [11]), (ii) support material (e.g. polyaniline [12,13]), and (iii) organic solvents [7] were reported for heterogeneously catalysed citral hydrogenation over the past years. In the case of supported ruthenium catalysts [6,14–19], the hydrogenation of citral produces citronellal, geraniol and nerol with citronellol as conjoint consecutive product. Modifying these type of catalysts with tin [16,20,21], iron [17,22], cerium [23] or copper [24] increases the selectivity towards geraniol and nerol. Homogeneous or multiphase catalysis with ruthenium complexes gave also high yields of unsaturated alcohols [25–27]. Ionic liquids are low-melting salts and gained much interest in catalysis [28–30] enabling novel concepts for the immobilisation of metal complexes (supported ionic liquid phase, SILP) that catalyse hydrogenation [31] or hydroformylation of unsaturated alkene [32–34]. In a similar fashion, the deposition of ionic liquids as thin layer (solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer, SCILL) was demonstrated in the silica supported nickel catalysed hydrogenation of cyclooctadiene enhancing the selectivity towards cyclooctene [35]. A similar concept was recently shown for the hydrogenation of ethylene on ionic liquid mediated platinum nanoparticles supported on silica [36]. Citral hydrogenation by using ionic liquids as bulk solvents was realised on supported palladium [11,37] and nickel–tin [11] catalysts. Due to their lower hydrogen solubility in contrast to conventional organic solvents, the activity was decreased in presence of ionic liquids. Palladium nanoparticles stabilised by ionic liquids on carbon fibres as support were able to catalyse citral hydrogenation [38–40]. Recently, we observed a promoting effect of dicyanamide based ionic liquids [41,42] in the supported palladium catalysed citral hydrogenation and under optimised reaction conditions the one-pot synthesis of citronellal was obtained by inhibition of the consecutive reaction towards dihydrocitronellal [43,44]. An interaction between palladium and the dicyanamide anion was proposed for the selectivity enhancement as it was shown by IR spectroscopy [44]. In a first approach, modification of Ru/Al2O3 with conventional ionic liquids based on the [PF6]− or [NTf2]− anion to obtain SCILL revealed a more pronounced selectivity towards geraniol and nerol [45]. Aim of this study was to examine the influence of [NTf2]− based ionic liquids as additives on the selectivity pattern of supported ruthenium catalysed citral hydrogenation which allows now the investigation of the intramolecular selectivity (i.e. CO vs. CC hydrogenation) and thus, the parallel reaction with respect to citral instead of the consecutive reaction (i.e. citral to citronellal but not further to dihydrocitronellal) typically catalysed by palladium [6,37,43,44]. Furthermore, the determination of initial turnover frequencies for the respective products will give insights how the ionic liquid acts as modifier."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst characterisation,"2.1 Catalyst characterisation The ruthenium content was determined by ICP-OES on a Spectro Modula, whereas the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was diluted in molten Na2O2 prior to analysis. Nitrogen physisorption was performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb at 77K to determine the textural properties of the catalysts, whereby the samples (100mg) were dried at 423K for 2h prior to analysis. By increasing relative pressures (multipoint-method), adsorption isotherms were recorded and specific BET [46] surface area and BJH [47] pore diameter were determined. The chemisorption experiment was performed at 294K and the sample was pulsed with H2 (435μL at 0.1MPa) until saturation was completed. The mean particle diameter was calculated using following equation: (1) d Ru = 6 ⋅ ( v Ru / a Ru ) ⋅ f S ⋅ w Ru ( n H 2 / m cat ) ⋅ M Ru whereby v Ru represents the atomic volume and a Ru the atomic surface area of ruthenium (data and equation obtained from [48]), f S the stoichiometry factor of H2 (1:1), on ruthenium, ( n H 2 / m cat ) the chemisorbed amount of hydrogen per catalyst mass."
3,Citral hydrogenation,"2.2 Citral hydrogenation Citral hydrogenation was conducted in a stainless steel autoclave (Parr, 300mL) equipped with magnetic stirring (impeller type) and a heating jacket. After charging the reactor with catalyst (Ru/Al2O3, Alfa Aesar, m cat =1g) and, if necessary, with ionic liquid ([BMIM][NTf2]=1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, [HMIM][NTf2]=1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, Merck, m IL =0.3–0.5g), the citral (Merck) solution (0.3molL−1 in n-hexane, Roth) was introduced. The reactor was then closed and magnetic stirring tuned to its desired frequency (1200rpm). For inertisation, the suspension was flushed with argon (2MPa, three times) before heating up at 1MPa Ar pressure to 373K. Charging the reactor with hydrogen (7MPa) determined the start of the reaction. During the course of hydrogenation, samples were taken periodically and analysed by temperature programmed gas capillary chromatography (HP 6890) using an Agilent DB-Wax column (l =30m, d i =0.25mm, t f =0.25μm), FID, and n-tetradecane (Merck) as internal standard."
4,Results,"The analysis of textural properties by nitrogen physisorption revealed a decrease in surface area and pore volume of Ru/Al2O3 after reaction (Table 1 ). In presence of [BMIM][NTf2] as additive, the post citral hydrogenation analysis of the catalyst gave very low values for the pore characteristics (S BET =27m2 g−1, V pore =0.29mLg−1). Characterisation by chemisorption of Ru/Al2O3 gave an H/Ru ratio of 0.16 corresponding to a mean particle diameter of 9.6nm. The conversion levels of citral hydrogenation and its selectivities (at 50% conversion) in presence of ionic liquids are summarised in Table 2 . For reference, a run with neat Ru/Al2O3 was also carried out without ionic liquid in order to compare activity and selectivity patterns. After 6h reaction time, full conversion was obtained for the hydrogenation of citral over IL-free Ru/Al2O3 and citronellal (S =51%) was the main product (entry 1). The unsaturated alcohols and citronellol were formed with much lower selectivity (26% and 14%, respectively). It is worth mentioning that the selectivities towards the unsaturated alcohols were enhanced (S =43…46%, entries 2–4) by [NTf2]− based ionic liquids lowering the citronellal selectivities for all runs (S =34…37%). The conversion levels for all three runs were decreased compared to the experiment without ionic liquid and depended on the introduced amount of [BMIM][NTf2] (entries 2 and 4). Independent on the choice of cation ([BMIM]+ or [HMIM]+, entries 2 and 3) nearly quantitative conversion (X =93…94%) was obtained and production of geraniol/nerol was favoured. Moreover, it should be noted that the amount of other by-products was lowered slightly (S =4…7% instead of >9%) in presence of [NTf2]− based ionic liquids. This beneficial effect of these ionic liquids should be illustrated by S–X plots for geraniol/nerol, citronellal, and citronellol, as depicted in Figs. 2–4 . Throughout the course of hydrogenation, geraniol/nerol selectivity is increased by the ionic liquids compared to IL-free conditions and ranges between 35% at the start of reaction to a maximum of 46% for conversions greater 50% (Fig. 2). Citronellal was obtained in higher amounts under IL-free conditions than for the addition of ionic liquids, whereas the selectivity decreases with increasing conversion reaching a minimum at X >99% (Fig. 3). The selectivity towards the consecutive product citronellol was not affected noticeably by the ionic liquids (Fig. 4), which increases during course of hydrogenation finally to 55%. In order to identify the selectivity enhancement towards the unsaturated alcohols in the case of adding the ionic liquids, initial turnover frequencies (TOFs) were determined by exponential fitting of the respective time-dependent decay on citral concentration of each reaction under the assumption of first-order kinetics and the characteristical data for Ru/Al2O3 obtained by ICP-OES and chemisorption, respectively (Table 3 ). For all listed reactions the accuracy of the fitting was checked and the regression coefficient was always greater than 0.967. Additionally, the initial site-time yields (STY [s−1] [49]) of citral hydrogenation were calculated by multiplying the initial TOF with the initial selectivity of the respective product (determined by extrapolation of the S–X plot towards X =0) which are also shown in Table 3. As expected, the reaction without presence of ionic liquid showed the highest TOF (0.140s−1) which decreased by a factor of about 3 with increasing ionic liquid mass reaching a minimum for 0.5g [BMIM][NTf2] (0.048s−1). Except for the initial TOF towards citronellol, all STYs were also lowered if an ionic liquid was present. Especially for citronellal (product of CC hydrogenation), the STY could be remarkably lowered by adding ionic liquids that decreased to a maximum factor of ∼4. In contrast, the STY of geraniol/nerol (products of CO hydrogenation) was lowered to a much lesser extent (only factor ∼2) and ranged between 1.5–2.8×10−2 s−1. In the case of citronellol (product of consecutive hydrogenation), a maximum could be observed by using 0.3g [HMIM][NTf2] (6.1×10−2 s−1), which was in the same range than for the hydrogenation without ionic liquid (5.6×10−2 s−1)."
5,Discussion,"In good accordance to previous findings on citral hydrogenation over ionic liquid coated supported palladium catalysts [43,44] and over Pd/C with ILs as bulk solvents [37], where in both cases a decrease in pore volume and surface area by treatment with ionic liquids was observed, the modified textural properties may be attributed to an immobilisation of the ionic liquids into the pores indicating an in situ generation of the catalytically active material that was already shown for the addition of ILs onto supported Pd catalysts [43–45]. The selectivity pattern of the IL-free Ru/Al2O3 in our study is comparable to alumina supported Ru catalysts known for citral hydrogenation [16], where selectivities towards geraniol and nerol are reported for citral hydrogenation on supported Ru catalysts [6,14,15,17,18,20,21,24,49] ranging from 13% [21] to 49% [50] at 50% citral conversion. This could be ascribed in general to the variety of the support material as well as aspects of catalyst preparation and chemical engineering, e.g. citral concentration and solvent. By choosing n-hexane as solvent, formation of citronellal ethylacetal, which was described earlier for ruthenium on alumina in presence of ethanol [15], could be circumvented and findings by Vannice et al. [7] have shown that a general trend for the initial turnover frequency of citral consumption could not be determined by varying the solvent and its respective polarity. In addition, solvent variation on the silver catalysed citral hydrogenation revealed the highest selectivity towards geraniol and nerol at 30% conversion by the use of n-hexane [51]. The use of Al2O3 as support material hinders in general the production of isopulegol which was reported for Ru/SiO2 in citral hydrogenation by Vannice et al. [6]. As previously shown on Pd/Polyaniline catalysts [44], an addition of ionic liquids leads to a decrease in the initial reaction rate and is also found in this study for Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. Because the results of nitrogen physisorption indicate coverage of the catalyst by the IL, the deposition of the latter onto the ruthenium surface influences the adsorption of citral and hydrogen. Furthermore, a decreased product desorption leading to an inhibition of active sites may be also taken into account. It has to be noted that the variation of the alkyl chain length of the imidazolium cation (butyl vs. hexyl) does not affect the selectivity pattern and the role of ionic liquid as modifier in this study is determined primarily by the physico-chemical properties, e.g. viscosity, density, that are less dependent on the type of alkyl chain. Although [BMIM][NTf2] and [HMIM][NTf2] are weakly basic [42], the decrease in citral conversion in presence of the added ionic liquids should be interpreted by their low hydrogen solubility in comparison to organic solvents [52]. This phenomenon is discussed for ionic liquids as bulk solvents in citral hydrogenation on Pd/Al2O3 [11]. Similar to catalyst activity, the selectivity pattern will be modified by the ionic liquids, as it is observed for [BMIM][NTf2] and [HMIM][NTf2] in the present study with geraniol and nerol as favoured products. The preferred formation of the unsaturated alcohols can be attributed, in general, to the electron-donating properties of a second metal [1,2] or to Lewis-acidic sites activating the CO group [1,2,17,23]. Besides the activation through a second metal, addition of bases, e.g. trimethylamine [22], improves also the selectivity towards geraniol and nerol in citral hydrogenation which is in good agreement to homogeneous or multiphase catalysis on ruthenium triphenylphosphine and TPPTS complexes, respectively [25–27]. The influence of alkali promoters on the ruthenium catalysed hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal (Prenal) was investigated by Blackmond et al. [53]. A polarisation of the CO group by potassium ions favoured prenal hydrogenation towards prenol concomitant with a decrease in CC group hydrogenation. For Pt catalysed liquid-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [54], addition of triphenylphosphine leads to a decrease in activity whereas the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol was slightly enhanced. The observed results in our study, namely that the formation of geraniol and nerol was enhanced in presence of [NTf2]− based ILs, may be interpreted as a modifying effect by the IL, which inhibits primarily the CC hydrogenation. The decrease in STY towards citronellal is more pronounced than for the unsaturated alcohols."
6,Conclusion,"In the present study, ionic liquids act as modifiers on the alumina supported ruthenium catalysed citral hydrogenation influencing conversion and selectivity. It supports the findings on supported palladium citral hydrogenation in which ionic liquids have a role as modifier enabling a one-pot synthesis of the intermediate citronellal by inhibiting the consecutive hydrogenation to dihydrocitronellal. Now, by choosing an appropriate IL, the parallel reaction towards citronellal or geraniol/nerol, i.e. CC vs. CO hydrogenation, is modified, whereby the unsaturated alcohols are produced with improved selectivities in presence of [NTf2]− based ionic liquids. It is shown that the deposition of ionic liquids influences the site-time yields whereby the conversion level and citronellal formation rate is lowered. As it was recently shown for controlling selectivity of consecutive reaction pathways in the selective citral hydrogenation on dicyanamide modified palladium/support catalysts, the performance on Ru/Al2O3 gives now an opportunity to influence the intramolecular selectivity and, thus, a parallel reaction. The observed effects are certainly helpful to control heterogeneously catalysed reactions by simplifying their complex reaction networks."
