0,Introduction,"Functionalised aromatic amines and alcohols are important intermediates in the production of a range of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, cosmetics, herbicides, dyes and polymers [1,2]. Amine and alcohol production can be achieved via the catalytic hydrogenation of nitro compounds and aldehydes [3,4]. Selectivity in the targeted reduction of NO2 or CO in the presence of other reactive functional groups (e.g. CN, CC, COOH) remains challenging [5,6]. In this study, we examine the feasibility of controlling the selective hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Reduction of NO2 is more facile than CO and the amine should be the preferred product [7]. The possible pathways associated with the conversion of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde are presented in Fig. 1 , where 4-aminobenzaldehyde (step (I)) and 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (step (II)) are commercially important compounds [8,9]. This reaction has been studied over soluble metal (Pd [10,11], Ru [8] and Co [12]) complexes and solid transition metal (supported Au, Ru, Ni, Pd and Pt [6,8,9,13–15] and PtO2–H2O [16]) catalysts in the liquid phase (P =1–50bar, T =303–423K). There has been only one reported gas-phase application (for 3-nitrobenzaldehyde) over MgO [17]. The reduction of both nitro and carbonyl functions generates 4-aminobenzyl alcohol (steps (III) and (IV)) as reported for reaction over PtO2–H2O [16], sol–gel entrapped Pd [18], MgO [17] and Ru/Al2O3 [8]. Moreover, the formation of 4-nitrotoluene can result from either direct attack of CO (step (V)) or further conversion of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (step (VI)) and has been detected in reactions over Au/Fe2O3 and Fe(OH) x [13]. Generation of 4-aminotoluene can proceed via steps (VII), (VIII) and (IX). It is well established [6,9,11,16] that 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzyl alcohol polymerise during hydrogenation with the formation of toxic azoxy compounds. The latter is favoured by the longer contact times that apply in conventional batch processes [11] and should be circumvented in continuous operation. Taking an overview of the literature, 4-aminobenzaldehyde has been the major product with selectivities up to 99% [6,9,10,12,13]. Preferential 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol formation has been demonstrated in reactions involving Ru complex catalysts [8], but the precise source of this selectivity or the means of controlling product distribution remains unresolved. Studies to date have focused on batch liquid-phase processes where enhanced selectivity in homogeneous catalysis required an alkali additive (KOH) [10,12] and operation under reflux conditions [12]. A switch to heterogeneous catalysis offers advantages in terms of product/catalyst separation while economies of scale favour continuous processes for high throughput. The use of Au catalysts has shown promise in the liquid-phase conversion of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to 4-aminobenzaldehyde although polymerisation was also observed [6,9,14]. Supported Au has exhibited chemoselectivity in NO2 reduction to NH2 in the presence of other reactive functionalities, e.g. CN [19], CC [9], Br [20] and Cl [21]. Bailie and Hutchings [22] first demonstrated CO activation on Au/ZrO2, resulting in enhanced selectivity to crotyl alcohol. This work has led to a number of investigations on the selective hydrogenation of CO to COH [23–33] over Au, but none of these studies have considered the conversion of nitrobenzaldehyde. Previous work has established the importance of the support [26,34–36] and Au particle size [21,37–39] in determining hydrogenation performance. Adopting Au/ZrO2 as our starting point, we have examined the role of support (TiO2 and Al2O3) and Au size on 4-nitrobenzaldehyde hydrogenation activity/selectivity with a consideration of reaction temperature effects."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and activation The ZrO2 support was prepared by precipitation of zirconium (IV) oxychloride octahydrate (ZrOCl2·8H2O, ⩾99.5%, Aldrich) with aqueous ammonia (35% w/w NH3, Fisher). The ZrOCl2 solution (0.1M) was added dropwise with vigorous stirring to aqueous ammonia (2.5M). Temporal pH changes were measured with a crystal-body electrode coupled to a data logging and collection system (Pico Technology), calibrated with standard buffer solutions (pH 7 and 10). The resultant hydrogel was washed with distilled water until the wash water was Cl-free (AgNO3 test), dried at 373K for 24h and calcined in air (20cm3 min−1 g−1) at 1Kmin−1 to 673K for 5h. Gold (ca. 1% w/w) supported on ZrO2, TiO2 (Degussa) and Al2O3 (Puralox) was prepared by deposition–precipitation (DP) where a suspension (300cm3) of HAuCl4 (173mg, 99.999%, Aldrich), aqueous urea (100cm3, 2.8moldm−3) and support (5g) was stirred (300rpm) and heated (1Kmin−1) to 353K, which was maintained for ca. 200min. Synthesis was conducted in the dark to avoid formation of metallic colloids in solution by photoreduction of Au(III) [40]. As a high residual chloride content (>300ppm) results in the formation of larger (>20nm) Au particles [41] and can poison catalytic sites [42], the catalyst precursor was washed repeatedly. Gold on Al2O3 prepared by DP is denoted by AuAl2O3-1. Alumina-supported Au was also prepared by standard impregnation of Al2O3 with an aqueous HAuCl4 solution (Aldrich, 7.3×10−3 M, 39cm3) where the slurry was heated at 2Kmin−1 to 353K and agitated (600rpm) in a He purge; this sample is denoted by AuAl2O3-2. The catalyst precursors were dried in He (10cm3 min−1 g−1) at 383K for 3h and sieved into a batch of 75μm average diameter. The samples were stored at 277K under He in the dark in order to prevent Au agglomeration, which can occur when kept in air and in the light [43]. The precursors were activated in 60cm3 min−1 H2 at 2Kmin−1 to 473K and passivated in 1% v/v O2/He at ambient temperature for ex situ analysis."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation The pH associated with the point of zero charge (pH PZC ) of ZrO2 was determined by potentiometric mass titration [44]. Three different masses (0.025, 0.050 and 0.075g) were immersed in 50cm3 0.1M NaCl to which a known amount of NaOH (0.1M) had been added to adjust the pH to 11. After stabilisation of the pH (ca. 1h), titration with HCl (0.1M) was performed under continuous agitation in He and temporal pH changes measured as described above. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), BET surface area, total pore volume, H2 chemisorption and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were measured using the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome) unit. In TPR analysis, samples (0.2g) were loaded into a U-shaped Quartz cell (10cm×3.76mm i.d.) and heated in 17cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5% v/v H2/N2 at 2Kmin−1 to 473±1K. The effluent gas passed through a liquid N2 trap, and H2 consumption was monitored by TCD with data acquisition/manipulation using the TPR Win™ software. The activated samples were maintained at 473K in a constant flow of H2/N2 until the signal returned to baseline, swept with 65cm3 min−1 N2 for 1.5h and cooled to ambient temperature. The samples were subjected to H2 chemisorption using a pulse (10μl) titration procedure, followed by TPD in N2 (65cm3 min−1) at 45Kmin−1 to 1173K. Surface area and pore volume were determined, respectively, in 30% and 95% v/v N2/He using undiluted N2 as internal standard. At least 3 cycles of N2 adsorption–desorption in the flow mode were employed, using the standard single-point method. The measurements were reproducible to within ±6% and the values reported represent the mean. Surface acidity was determined by pyridine adsorption followed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy analysis. Samples were pressed (ca. 1×103 kgcm−2) into thin wafers (ca. 10mgcm−2) and placed in the IR cell. Before pyridine adsorption/desorption, the samples were treated under static conditions at 473K for 1h in H2 (666mbar) and then outgassed under secondary vacuum at 423K for 1h. The sample wafers were contacted at ambient temperature with gaseous pyridine (1.33mbar) via a separate cell containing liquid pyridine. The spectra were recorded following desorption at 423K with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer (resolution 2cm−1, 128scans). The reported spectra were obtained after subtraction of the spectrum recorded prior to pyridine adsorption. The number of Lewis acid sites titrated by pyridine was obtained using a molar extinction coefficient value (ε =2.22cmμmol−1) for the ν 19 b vibration of coordinated pyridine (Py-L) at ca. 1455cm−1 [45]. Gold content was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer with an air–acetylene flame from the diluted extract in aqua regia. Powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded (over the range 10°⩽2θ ⩽85°) on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Diffractograms were identified using the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. tetragonal ZrO2 (50-1089), monoclinic ZrO2 (37-1487), anatase (21-1272), rutile (21-1276), Al2O3 (10-0425) and Au (04-0784). The fraction of monoclinic zirconia was calculated, based on the work of Toraya et al. [46], using the integrated intensities (I) of the (111) and (−111) monoclinic (m-ZrO2) and (011) tetragonal (t-ZrO2) planes, (1) X m = I m ( - 1 1 1 ) + I m ( 1 1 1 ) I m ( - 1 1 1 ) + I m ( 1 1 1 ) + I t ( 0 1 1 ) ; V m = 1.31 × X m 1 + 0.31 × X m where Xm represents the intensity ratio and Vm the fraction of monoclinic zirconia. Gold particle morphology and size were determined by transmission electron microscopy analysis; JEOL JEM 2011 HRTEM unit with a UTW energy dispersive X-ray detector (Oxford Instruments) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV using Gatan Digital Micrograph 3.4 for data acquisition/manipulation. Samples for analysis were prepared by dispersion in acetone and deposited on a holey carbon/Cu grid (300 Mesh). Up to 450 individual Au particles were counted for each catalyst, and the mean Au particle sizes are given as a surface area-weighted average (dTEM ) [34]. Gold dispersion (D) was calculated from dTEM values [47] and used to determine turnover frequency (TOF (s−1)). XPS spectra were collected on a SPECS (Phoibos MCD 150) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using an Al Kα (hν =1486.6eV) X-ray source. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated with respect to the CC/CH components of the C 1s peak (BE=284.7eV). All spectra processing was carried out using the Casa XPS software package."
4,Catalysis procedure,"2.3 Catalysis procedure Reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure at 423–473K, in situ after catalyst activation (in 60mlmin−1 H2 at 473K for 1h), in a fixed bed vertical glass tubular reactor (60cm×15mm i.d.). The catalytic reactor and operating conditions to ensure negligible heat/mass transport limitations have been described elsewhere [21,31,48], but some features, pertinent to this study, are given below. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone, ensuring that the organic reactant was vaporised and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst. Temperature was continuously monitored using a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde as a solution in ethanol was delivered at a fixed calibrated flow rate via a glass/Teflon air-tight syringe and Teflon line using a microprocessor-controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific). A co-current flow of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and ultra pure H2 (<1% v/v 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in H2) was maintained at GHSV =2×104 h−1 with an inlet 4-nitrobenzaldehyde molar flow (F)=6×10−5 molh−1. Hydrogen flow rate was monitored using a Humonics (Model 520) digital flowmeter where H2 content was far in excess of the stoichiometric requirements. The mass of Au to inlet 4-nitrobenzaldehyde feed rate (m/F) ratio spanned the range 0.6–12gAu mol−1 h. Reaction of benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene over Au/ZrO2 and Au/Al2O3-2 at 443K was also examined. Passage of each reactant in a stream of H2 through the empty reactor did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was frozen in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent analysis, which was made using a Perkin–Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionisation detector, employing a DB-1 (50m×0.33mm i.d., 0.20μm film thickness) capillary column (J&W Scientific). 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde (Aldrich, 98% w/w purity), benzaldehyde (Fluka, ⩾98% w/w), nitrobenzene (Fluka, ⩾99%) and ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, ⩾99%) were used as supplied without further purification. Fractional 4-nitrobenzaldehyde conversion (X) is defined by (2) X = [ 4 - nitrobenzaldehyde ] in - [ 4 - nitrobenzaldehyde ] out [ 4 - nitrobenzaldehyde ] in where the subscripts ‘out’ and ‘in’ refer to the outlet and inlet gas streams, respectively. Selectivity in terms of 4-aminobenzaldehyde (SMBAD ), as an example, is given by (3) S MBAD = [ 4 - aminobenzaldehyde ] out [ 4 - nitrobenzaldehyde ] in - [ 4 - nitrobenzaldehyde ] out where 4-aminobenzaldehyde yield (YMBAD ) was obtained from (4) Y MBAD = S MBAD × X Repeated reactions with samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered a product composition that was reproducible to within ±3%."

6,Au/ZrO2: Synthesis and characterisation,"3.1 Au/ZrO2: Synthesis and characterisation The structural characteristics of ZrO2 in terms of surface area and crystalline phase depend on a range of parameters, including the Zr salt precursor, pH and duration of precipitation and post-treatment, notably washing and calcination stages [49–51]. Precipitation of hydrous zirconia was accompanied by a temporal pH decrease from 11.8 to 9.4, as presented in Fig. 2 (a). The same pH response has been observed under equivalent synthesis conditions [52]. The XRD pattern of the calcined sample (Fig. 2(c)) exhibits both tetragonal and monoclinic phases. Six of the nine XRD peaks can be ascribed to monoclinic ZrO2 ((110), (−111), (111), (200), (022) and (310)) planes with three signals due to tetragonal ZrO2 ((011), (112) and (121)) planes; the fractional monoclinic content (Vm from Eq. (1))=0.65). Chuah et al. [52] have shown that zirconia-phase composition is sensitive to precipitation temperature, pH and calcination. Synthesis at temperatures in the range 303–353K in basic media and calcination at 773K generated a mixed phase that was predominantly monoclinic (Vm =0.50–0.78) [52]. The surface area (104m2 g−1, Table 1 ) and total pore volume (0.14cm3 g−1) are consistent with values (109m2 g−1 [53] and 0.16cm3 g−1 [54]) reported previously. The pH associated with the point of zero charge (pH PZC ) is a critical support property that determines solution pH requirements to ensure metal precursor–support interactions during catalyst preparation by deposition–precipitation [55]. A pH PZC of 7.4 was determined experimentally for ZrO2, which is in general agreement with the literature where pH PZC in the 6.2–8.5 interval has been recorded [56,57]. The pH PZC depends on oxide synthesis and composition where a lower value (6.2) is associated with the pure tetragonal form relative to the monoclinic phase (8.5) [56]. The temporal pH variation in the synthesis of (0.8% w/w) Au/ZrO2 is given in Fig. 2(b) where the pH PZC of ZrO2 is identified by the horizontal dotted line. The increase in temperature (up to 353K) resulted in a progressive decomposition of urea with an accompanying increase in solution pH. As the latter remained below the pH PZC the support bore a positive charge, favouring interaction with anionic gold species in solution ( AuCl 4 - and/or Au ( OH ) Cl 3 - ) [43]. The surface protonated hydroxyl sites act as nucleation centres for Au deposition [58]. The XRD pattern for Au/ZrO2 as prepared (Fig. 2(d)) only exhibits peaks due to monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2. Compared with the starting ZrO2 (Fig. 2(c)), the relative peak intensities differ and the monoclinic content is higher (Vm =0.85). This can be linked to the deposition step and associated contact with the aqueous Au salt solution, pH and temperature variations. Indeed, it should be noted that Xie et al. [59] observed a transformation of tetragonal ZrO2 following immersion in water at 298K (for 12h), resulting in a 78% conversion to monoclinic ZrO2 with no change to surface area. This was attributed to differences in surface free energy between the two phases after water adsorption. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of Au/ZrO2 generated the profile shown in Fig. 2(f) where a positive peak (H2 consumption) with Tmax =452K is in evidence. There was no detectable H2 consumption in the TPR (to 773K) of the ZrO2 support, which agrees with the literature [60,61], and the signal recorded for Au/ZrO2 can be attributed to the reduction in cationic gold. Positive TPR signals in the range 424–503K range have been recorded elsewhere for Au/ZrO2 [54,62]. In this study, the H2 consumed (Table 1) corresponds to the amount required (to within 10%) for the reduction of supported Au3+ to Au0. The surface area (93m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.13cm3 g−1) of the activated catalyst were lower than that recorded for the support alone (Table 1), which can be ascribed to partial pore blockage by the Au component. The relative intensity of the XRD peaks coincides for Au/ZrO2 pre- (Fig. 2(d)) and post- (Fig. 2(e)) TPR, indicating that the reduction step had no effect on support-phase composition. A weak signal at 38.1° (post-TPR) can be attributed to Au (111), but the peak intensity is too low to allow an accurate evaluation of Au particle size by standard line broadening analysis. Gold particle morphology and size were probed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and a representative micrograph is given in Fig. 2(g), which reveals quasi-spherical particles at the nanoscale (3–12nm). Particle size distribution is illustrated by the histogram in Fig. 2(h), which gives a surface area-weighted mean Au diameter of 7nm, matching that reported by Mohr et al. [38] for the synthesis of Au/ZrO2 by deposition–precipitation. The vast majority of Au particles are <10nm, which has been established as crucial for hydrogenation activity [63]. The electronic character of the supported Au phase can be critical in determining reactant adsorption/activation and consequent activity/selectivity [35,39] and is dependent on support interaction and dispersion [64]. XPS analysis was employed to probe Au electronic state where the profile (Fig. 2(i)) over the Au 4f binding energy (BE) region generates signals at 83.5±0.2eV (Table 1) and 87.3±0.2eV, which are in line with Au 4f 7/2 (83.7eV [62], 83.8eV [64]) and 4f 5/2 (87.6eV) values reported for Au/ZrO2. This represents a shift to lower BE relative to the reference Au foil 4f 7/2 (84.0eV) and may indicate electron transfer from the support to the nanoscale Au [65]. Catalytic activity in hydrogen mediated reactions is dependent on the H2 adsorption/dissociation capacity of the catalyst. Hydrogen chemisorption and release (TPD) results for Au/ZrO2 are given in Table 1. The available literature on the dynamics of H2 interaction with Au/ZrO2 is limited although hydrogenation activity has been established [22,62,66,67]. Dissociative uptake of H2 can occur at low coordination Au sites, i.e. at edges and corners [33,68] and H2 chemisorption is enhanced with increased Au dispersion [32,63,69]. Zhang and co-workers [54] have proposed that H2 activation requires the combined action of ZrO2 hydroxyl groups and surface Au sites. Moreover, it is known that H2 adsorbed on supported metals can spillover onto the ZrO2 support [70]. We could find no reported data with which to compare our ambient temperature H2 chemisorption value ( 56 μ mol g Au - 1 , Table 1). We should note that this level of uptake is appreciably lower than that recorded for other transition metal systems, such as Pt/ZrO2 (up to 1440 μ mol g Pt - 1 ) [61,71]. Hydrogen released during TPD far exceeded H2 chemisorbed, suggesting that uptake is an activated process with the possible contribution of spillover hydrogen during TPR to the total H2 desorbed."
7,Au/ZrO2: Catalytic response,"3.2 Au/ZrO2: Catalytic response The hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde over Au/ZrO2 generated 4-aminobenzaldehyde as the only product with no detectable hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis of the carbonyl group. This is the first report of 100% selectivity to 4-aminobenzaldehyde over Au catalysts, where reaction exclusivity was maintained at high levels of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde conversion (Fig. 3 (a)). Moreover, there was no evidence of any polymerisation or azoxy formation. A representative time-on-stream 4-nitrobenzaldehyde conversion (X) profile is presented in Fig. 3(b) that shows a temporal decline, which can be expressed in terms of the empirical relationship [20] (5) ( X - X 0 ) ( X 4 h - X 0 ) = t ( β + t ) where X 4 h represents fractional conversion after 4 h on-stream, β is a time scale fitting parameter, and X 0 is the initial conversion (obtained from the fit to Eq. (5), as shown in Fig. 3(b)). Reaction exclusivity to 4-aminobenzaldehyde was maintained with time-on-stream. Loss of activity during hydrogenation over Au catalysts has been attributed to coke deposition that occludes the active sites [72]. Moreover, water released as the by-product of nitro group reduction can have a deleterious effect on catalytic activity [54,73]. In previous work [20,31], we have established the applicability of pseudo-first-order kinetics for hydrogenation over supported Au, (6) ln ( 1 - X 0 ) - 1 = k m F where m/F is the ratio of mass of Au to inlet 4-nitrobenzaldehyde molar feed rate. The linear fit (passing through the origin) given in Fig. 3(c) confirms adherence to pseudo-first-order kinetics; the associated specific rate constant (k) is given in Table 2 . Prior published work has demonstrated a dependence of activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of nitro compounds and aldehydes on Au particle size [38,39] and the nature of the support [29,35,36]. In this work, we have set out to assess the feasibility of controlling product distribution in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. We obtained sole formation of 4-aminobenzaldehyde over Au particles (3–12nm, mean=7nm) on a non-reducible (ZrO2) support. Metal–support interactions in the case of titania are known to influence catalytic response [74]. Indeed, the use of Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2 in acrolein hydrogenation has revealed differences in activity/selectivity that were linked to Au coordination and reactivity at the Au–support interface [38,39]. We accordingly examined the catalytic action of TiO2 as an alternative Au support."
8,Au/TiO2: Characterisation,"3.3 Au/TiO2: Characterisation Preparation of Au/TiO2 by deposition–precipitation delivered a 1.2% w/w Au loading with a lower total (BET) surface area but comparable pore volume to Au/ZrO2 (Table 1). TPR analysis (Fig. 4 (a)) generated a reduction peak 364K that is close to the range (373–432K) previously reported for Au/TiO2 [34,75]. The associated H2 consumption (Table 1) is higher than that required for the reduction of Au3+ to Au0 ( 7.6 mmol g Au - 1 ). The excess H2 can contribute to a partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ at the Au–support interface [34,75]. The XRD measurement (Fig. 4(b)) is consistent with a mixture of anatase and rutile forms of TiO2 where anatase:rutile≈5:1, which is characteristic of Degussa P25 [76] for thermal treatment up to 923K [77]. The signal at 38.4° suggests the presence of Au metal but the peak overlaps with one due to anatase, which does not permit a calculation of Au size. The representative TEM image shown in Fig. 4(c) reveals dispersed nanoscale Au particles. The TEM-derived Au particle size histogram (Fig. 4(d)) shows a narrower distribution of smaller Au particles relative to Au/ZrO2 with a surface area-weighted mean diameter=4.7nm. The Au 4f 7/2 binding energy measured by XPS (83.4±0.2eV, see Table 1, spectrum not shown) is at the lower end of the range reported in the literature for Au/TiO2 (83.3–84.2eV) [64,65,78] and is close to the value recorded for Au/ZrO2. Dissociative hydrogen adsorption at ambient temperature has been established for Au/TiO2 [79,80]. In this study, H2 chemisorption and subsequent desorption were lower for Au/TiO2 when compared with Au/ZrO2 (Table 1). It is known that TiO x species, formed during activation, can migrate to the metal surface and occlude surface sites for H2 adsorption [81]. The lower H2-TPD can be attributed in part to the lower surface area that characterises Au/TiO2, limiting the extent of hydrogen spillover during TPR."
9,Au/TiO2: Catalytic response,"3.4 Au/TiO2: Catalytic response The hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde over Au/TiO2 has been studied in batch liquid mode, where 4-aminobenzaldehyde selectivity up to 99% was obtained [6,9]. Batch operation required high H2 pressure (10bar) with catalyst/product separation and purification stages. Gas-phase continuous operation ensures higher throughput at a lower operating pressure (P H2 <1bar). As was observed for Au/ZrO2, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde hydrogenation over Au/TiO2 generated 4-aminobenzaldehyde as the sole product. The reduction of nitro compounds requires effective polarisation of the NO function with nucleophilic hydrogen attack and the formation of a negatively charged intermediate [82]. Boronat et al. [68] noted higher selectivity to aminostyrene in nitrostyrene reduction over Au/TiO2 (98%) relative to Au/SiO2 (30%). Drawing on in situ IR analysis and quantum chemical calculations, they attributed this to NO2 activation at the Au–TiO2 interface. In a recent application of the selective energy transfer (SET) model to hydrogenation kinetics for a range of functionalised nitroarenes over Au/TiO2, activation of the O N O bending/stretching moiety at TiO2 or Au-TiO2 interface sites was proposed [83]. A similar surface dynamic can apply to selective NO2 reduction in the 4-nitrobenzaldehyde-Au/TiO2 reaction system. Au/TiO2 delivered a higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Au/ZrO2 (Table 2) although the latter exhibited greater H2 uptake and release (Table 1), which should lead to improved hydrogenation efficiency. We therefore propose that NO2 activation/polarisation is the limiting factor. Corma et al. [84] have demonstrated that nitrobenzene can adsorb on both Au and TiO2 where the interaction is weaker on the metal relative to the support but is significantly enhanced on highly uncoordinated Au atoms. The higher Au dispersion on TiO2 generates an increased proportion of edge and corner sites relative to Au/ZrO2 with a greater number of interfacial low-coordinated Au sites [85] that must contribute to enhanced TOF. It is established that the Au support plays a crucial role in modifying reactant activation in hydrogenation applications [26,35,68]. Reduction of both NO2 and CC in nitrostyrene was recorded for Au on SiO2 and C, in contrast to the selective action of Au on TiO2 and Fe2O3 [68]. Moreover, Au/FeOOH preferentially promoted the reduction of CO relative to CC in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, whereas both functional groups were reduced over Au/α-Fe2O3 [26]. In order to probe support effects further, we considered the catalytic consequences of using Al2O3 as an acidic carrier where two Au/Al2O3 samples with mean Au particle sizes that match Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2 were synthesised and tested."
10,Au/Al2O3: Characterisation,"3.5 Au/Al2O3: Characterisation The BET areas and pore volumes recorded for both Au/Al2O3 samples (Table 1) are in good agreement with previous reports [20,86]. TPR of the catalyst prepared by deposition–precipitation (Au/Al2O3-1, see Fig. 5 (a)) generated a peak with Tmax close to that recorded for Au/ZrO2, where H2 consumption matched the requirement for precursor reduction to zero valent Au. Hydrogen chemisorption agrees with that reported previously ( 33 – 38 μ mol g Au - 1 [87]) for equivalent Au/Al2O3 catalysts. Hydrogen desorption exceeded that measured for Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2 (Table 1), which can be attributed to the greater capacity of Al2O3 to accommodate spillover hydrogen [88]. The five XRD signals at 2θ =32–67° (Fig. 5(b)) correspond to the (220), (311), (222), (400) and (440) planes of cubic γ-Al2O3, where the broadness of the peaks is indicative of short range order. The absence of a detectable XRD signal for Au suggests a well-dispersed phase, which was confirmed by TEM analysis; a representative image is presented in Fig. 5(c). The diffractogram pattern for an isolated Au particle is given in Fig. 5(d) where the d-spacing (0.23) corresponds to the (111) plane of metallic gold. The Au particle size distribution (Fig. 5(e)) delivers a mean diameter (=4.3nm) close to that for Au/TiO2. Synthesis of alumina-supported Au with the same loading by impregnation (Au/Al2O3-2) generated a larger mean Au size (7.8nm, see Table 1); the associated catalyst characteristics are presented and discussed in detail elsewhere [31]. It is well established that catalyst synthesis by impregnation generates weak precursor/support interactions, leading to larger Au particles [27,67]. XPS analysis has generated equivalent BE values for both samples (83.2–83.3eV, Table 1). A shift in the Au 4f 7/2 signal to lower BE relative to the Au reference has already been reported for Au/Al2O3 and attributed to electron donation from the support [89,90]. 3.5.1 Au/Al2O3: Catalytic response In contrast to Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2, reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde over Au/Al2O3-1 generated 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol in addition to 4-aminobenzaldehyde as principal product (Table 2), i.e. reduction of both carbonyl and nitro functions (Fig. 1). Liu and co-workers [13] reported that the CO group in 4-nitrobenzaldehyde can be activated on Fe2O3 supported Au, but this resulted in hydrogenolysis leading to the formation of 4-nitrotoluene and 4-aminotoluene. The only reported production of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol involved the use of propyltriethylammonium ( CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 Net 3 + ) functionalized MCM-41-supported [H3Ru4(CO)12]− in liquid-phase (P H2 =50bar) operation [8]. This is the first report of CO group reduction with the formation of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol over Au catalysts. Selectivity was independent of conversion, as demonstrated in Fig. 6 (a). Alcohol formation suggests a critical contribution due to Al2O3. We have previously demonstrated selective hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3 [31]. Reduction of the carbonyl function is known to occur via a nucleophilic mechanism [91] where CO polarisation renders the oxygen susceptible to attack with hydrogen transfer to generate the alcohol [92]. Benzaldehyde interaction with the support can be ionic (e.g. on Mn3O4) or bridging (e.g. on Al2O3), the latter leading to the formation of a surface benzoate, which is an intermediate in alcohol formation. FTIR measurements have established that the benzoate results from benzaldehyde adsorption at Al3+ sites [93]. Lewis acidity is then a critical requirement, which we characterised by FTIR analysis using pyridine as an established probe molecule [94]. When pyridine is bonded to metal oxide sites, the frequency of ring-breathing vibrations (νCCN) is increased. The interaction of the nitrogen lone pair with oxide Lewis acid sites is associated with ν 8 a and ν 19 b bands position in the range 1600–1633cm−1 and 1445–1460cm−1, respectively, where a higher ν 8 a frequency reflects stronger acidity [94]. νCCN spectra (following outgas at 423K) are presented in Fig. 7 ; band positions and acid site concentrations are given in Table 3 . The ZrO2 and TiO2 supports present a peak at 1608±1cm−1, close to that reported previously (1603–1608cm−1 [94,95]), suggesting equivalent Lewis acid strength. In contrast, Al2O3 exhibits a principal peak at 1617cm−1 with a shoulder at a higher frequency (1623cm−1) that are associated with Al3+ sites in octahedral and tetrahedral symmetries, respectively [94]. The occurrence of a higher ν 8 a frequency for Al2O3 is indicative of stronger Lewis acidity than ZrO2 and TiO2, which can be attributed to the smaller Al ionic radius [96]. There is a measurable increase in acid site concentration in the order TiO2 >ZrO2 >Al2O3. The number of acid sites on oxide supports is dependent on synthesis method, bulk crystal structure, exposed surface crystallographic planes, pretreatment conditions as well as the method of analysis and a direct comparison with the literature is difficult [97,98]. The introduction of Au did not significantly affect acid strength or concentration in the case of Au/ZrO2, Au/TiO2 or Au/Al2O3-1. Conversion of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3-1 can be linked to strong surface Lewis acidity that contributes to the formation of a surface benzoate, which is reduced by hydrogen supplied from Au sites. Reaction over Au/Al2O3-1 was accompanied by a temporal variation of product yield, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The yield of 4-aminobenzaldehyde (YMBAD ) declined with time-on-stream while the yield of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (YNBOL ) showed an initial increase to attain a steady state (at t >1h). This response suggests a time dependent deactivation of sites responsible for NO2 reduction, as observed for Au/ZrO2 (Fig. 3(b)). 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde consumption followed pseudo-first-order kinetics as confirmed by the linear relationship presented in Fig. 6(c) with a TOF (Table 2) close to (but measurably higher than) Au/TiO2 and appreciably greater than that recorded for Au/ZrO2. This response is consistent with an activity dependence on Au particle size, where smaller Au particles (⩽5nm) show higher intrinsic efficiency. The effect of reaction temperature (423–473K) on the activity/selectivity delivered by (a) Au/TiO2 and (b) Au/Al2O3-1 can be assessed from the data presented in Fig. 8 . Full selectivity to 4-aminobenzaldehyde was retained over Au/TiO2 with an accompanying increase in selective hydrogenation rate with increasing temperature. In contrast, Au/Al2O3-1 exhibited a temperature dependent selectivity where 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol was favoured at lower temperatures, suggesting different activation energies for NO2 and CO reduction. Hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde over Au/Al2O3-2 in the temperature range 423–473K generated the results presented in Fig. 9 (a). In contrast to Au/Al2O3-1, reaction over Au/Al2O3-2 was 100% selective to 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (at 423–443K). The alcohol yield showed an initial temporal decline to attain a steady state after ca. 7-h on-stream (Fig. 9(b)). On the basis of FTIR measurement (Fig. 7), the Lewis acid strength of Au/Al2O3-2 was equivalent to that of Au/Al2O3-1. The increased number of acid sites on Au/Al2O3-2 (Table 3) can be ascribed to a higher residual Cl content [99], which is a feature of catalysts prepared by impregnation (using HAuCl4 as precursor) relative deposition–precipitation [87]. Reaction exclusivity to 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3-2 can be attributed to the action of surface acidity resulting in benzoate formation in tandem with larger Au size. In the hydrogenation of acrolein [38,39], increased selectivity to allyl alcohol (to the detriment of CC hydrogenation) was associated with an increase in Au size (from 4 to 8nm). The number of low coordination Au sites decreases with decreasing Au dispersion [85], limiting catalytic effectiveness in NO2 reduction, which must apply to Au/Al2O3-2. As in the case of Au/Al2O3-1, the formation of aminobenzaldehyde (NO2 reduction) over Au/Al2O3-2 was favoured by a higher reaction temperature (Fig. 9(a)). The larger mean Au size in Au/Al2O3-2 delivered an appreciably lower TOF than Au/Al2O3-1 (Table 2). Reaction selectivity was probed further by examining the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene over Au/Al2O3-2 and Au/ZrO2, which were chosen as they exhibit similar Au size but different surface acidities. Benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene hydrogenation generated benzyl alcohol and aniline, respectively, as the only products. The reactions are exothermic (calculated (HSC Chemistry, Version 5.0) ΔH 443K =−67kJmol−1 (benzaldehyde) and −469kJmol−1 (nitrobenzene)), exhibiting negative free energies where nitrobenzene→aniline (ΔG 443K =−442kJmol−1) is more thermodynamically favourable than benzaldehyde→benzyl alcohol (ΔG 443K =−18kJmol−1). Selectivity to 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol over Au/Al2O3-2 is consistent with the significantly higher rate of benzyl alcohol formation relative to aniline (Table 4 ). This can be attributed to a predominant contribution due to Lewis acidity that promotes CO activation. In contrast, reaction over Au/ZrO2, exhibiting weaker acidity, resulted in a measurably higher nitrobenzene hydrogenation rate relative to benzaldehyde. In this case, the more thermodynamically facile NO2 reduction is preferred, which can account for the observed selectivity in 4-nitrobenzaldehyde→4-aminobenzaldehyde. A higher reaction rate was obtained for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde relative to benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene over both catalysts, suggesting an activating inductive effect due to the second electronegative group on the benzene ring."
11,Conclusions,"We have established a dependence in the catalytic gas-phase hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde over supported Au on metal particle size and support properties, notably Lewis acidity. The preparation of a ZrO2 support by precipitation of ZrOCl2 in a basic medium generated a mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases (determined by XRD) with pH PZC =7.4. The incorporation of Au by deposition–precipitation increased the monoclinic ZrO2 content where TPR served to reduce Au3+ to Au0 (mean particle size=7.0nm) with greater H2 release (during TPD) relative to chemisorption, which is ascribed to spillover hydrogen. The hydrogenation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde over Au/ZrO2 generated 4-aminobenzaldehyde as sole product. An equivalent synthesis and activation of Au/TiO2 resulted in a narrower distribution of smaller Au particles (mean=4.7nm) that again exhibited 100% selectivity with respect to NO2 reduction and higher TOF relative to Au/ZrO2. In contrast, reaction over Au/Al2O3 generated 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol due to stronger surface Lewis acidity (as demonstrated by FTIR analysis following pyridine adsorption), which favours the formation of an intermediate benzoate that is reduced to the alcohol. Alcohol selectivity was enhanced with larger mean Au size, increasing number of acid sites and lower reaction temperature."
