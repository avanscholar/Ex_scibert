0,Introduction,"India is one among the select group of nations which follows the policy of reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel [1]. This policy provides the proper management of spent fuel arising from nuclear power production and is one of the best pathways toward making nuclear energy sustainable over a long period. During reprocessing of spent fuel for recovery of major actinides, uranium and plutonium, through PUREX process, a large volume of liquid high level waste (HLW) is generated. This HLW consists most of the metallic elements of periodic table, radioactive and non-radioactive and retains majority of radiotoxicity of the original spent fuel. It is therefore, essential to develop separation processes for radioactive elements for safe management of the waste as well as for value recovery from it. The usual practice is to separate HLW elements into several groups like long-lived minor actinides such as americium, neptunium and curium are separated together for transmutation, while heat-generating fission products like 137Cs and 90Sr, which contribute large part of heat load and radioactivity of HLW, are removed separately in order to make the remaining waste solution more amenable to manage [2,3]. In addition, the recovered 137Cs and 90Sr has wide applications as radiation source in radiotherapy, compact power source and a source of radionuclide 90Y (daughter product of 90Sr) for radiopharmaceutical applications [4,5]. A variety of processes like solvent extraction, ion exchange, membrane separation, precipitation, chromatographic separations, have been developed for removal of 137Cs and 90Sr from HLW [6–13]. Among these processes, solvent extraction has received more attention as it is well tested process in spent fuel reprocessing and also due to its several benefits like ease of handling, easy to remotise, high flexibility in stage designing and easy to scale up. Here in India, we are successfully separating 137Cs from HLW at plant scale using 1,3-dioctyloxycalix[4]arene-crown-6 + isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane solvent. The process selectively separates cesium with a very high decontamination factor of the order of 3600 [14], the separated 137Cs is being used to make vitrified γ-source for societal applications. Regarding separation of strontium from HLW several extraction processes have been reported, some of them are, UNEX [15,16], FPEX [17], SREX [18,19], TEHDGA and DGA (diglycolamide) process [20–23]. Among all these processes, SREX (strontium extraction) process employing DtBuCH18C6 as an extractant is one of the best known process for selective separation of strontium from HLW. In this process strontium is extracted from acidic waste solution using a 0.2 M solution of DtBuCH18C6 dissolved in a PUREX-like diluent comprised of 1.2 M TBP as phase modifier and an isoparaffinic hydrocarbon-Isopar-L as diluent. However, use of TBP, results in loss of selectivity of DtBuCH18C6 and significant extraction of uranium, plutonium and zirconium along with strontium takes place. This is undesirable when a high level waste is used to separate high purity 90Sr using SREX process for generation of 90Y required for therapeutic applications. In view of it, in this work, we have investigated the extraction of 90Sr from high salt content actual HLW using our existing industrial diluent system comprising of a mixture of isodecyl alcohol, a non-extracting phase modifier, and n-dodecane as diluent."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals 2.1.1 4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldibenzo]-18-crown-6 4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldibenzo]-18-crown-6 was synthesized as reported by Jun Fan et al. [24] by using cesium mediated template synthesis method where the reactants p-tert-butylcatechol, diethyleneglycol ditosylate and cesium carbonate as template was taken in molar ratios of 1.0:1.1:3.0 in THF as reaction medium. The reaction temperature was kept at 48–50 °C for 72 h. The product was purified with basic alumina and crystallized in n-hexane. Repeated re-crystallization was done to ensure complete absence of any phenolic or acidic impurities. Purity of 4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldibenzo]-18-crown-6 obtained was more than 99% (GC-MS). 2.1.2 4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldicyclohexano]-18-crown-6 (Fig. 1) Hydrogenation of 4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldibenzo]-18-crown-6 was carried according to procedure reported by Gula et al. [25]. As the reaction is catalytic hydrogenation, all the reactants/starting chemicals are made anhydrous prior to hydrogenation. The reaction mixture containing solution of 4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldibenzo]-18-crown-6 (substrate) in minimum amount of toluene, reaction medium-butanol, catalyst-5% Rh on activated γ-alumina (Sigma Aldrich) and reaction accelerator-isovelaric acid were taken in a weight ratio of 1:8:0.1:0.1 and hydrogenated at 65–70 °C, maintaining the hydrogen pressure at about 500–600 psi for 24 h to ensure complete hydrogenation of substrate. After necessary work-up the product was analyzed for unreacted substrate by GCMS, no peak at 472 m/z (4,4′(5′)-[di-tert-butyldicyclohexano]-18-crown-6) indicated complete hydrogenation of the substrate. As the product exists in various isomeric form and determination of absolute purity of the most effective isomer, cis-syn-cis is difficult, therefore, acceptability of the product was checked by determination of D Sr under standard conditions as reported by Horwitz et al. [18]. The synthesis procedure gave a consistent product quality and all the samples of hydrogenation were found to have D Sr ≥ 2.5 at 1 M nitric acid for 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6/1-octanol and thus qualified for further use. Other chemicals like, hydroxylammonium nitrate solution in water (2.8 M), isodecyl alcohol (mixed isomer) and n-dodecane were obtained from local market and used as received. High level waste of composition shown in Table 1 originated from our reprocessing plant of long-cooled pressurized heavy water reactor fuel with a burn-up of about 6500 MWD/tone has been used for extraction studies in batch mode. Stock solution of 85,89Sr (514 keV-γ) and 134Cs (604.7 keV-γ) were spiked to the waste for measurement of distribution ratios of strontium and cesium by tracer technique [26]."
3,Distribution ratio measurements,"2.2 Distribution ratio measurements For the determination of distribution ratio (D M), equal volume of organic phase constituted with DtBuCH18C6, isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane and aqueous phase containing metal ions was equilibrated for 15 min in a 5 mL glass vial. After the phase separation by centrifugation, the organic and aqueous phases were separated and analyzed for metal ions, the D M was calculated as the ratio of concentration (or radioactivity) of metal ion in the organic phase to the aqueous phase. Distribution ratio of strontium under control conditions and in the waste was determined by γ-radiometry of 85,89Sr by employing an intrinsic Ge detector connected to 4 K MCA at 514 keV. Assay of 134Cs and 241Am was carried out by gamma counting at 604.7 and 60 keV respectively. Plutonium was analyzed by alpha counting using ZnS/Ag scintillation counter and uranium by spectrophotometry using bromo-PADAP as chromogenic agent [27]. Determination of distribution ratio of inactive elements was done by analyzing only aqueous phase by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP/AES). The nitric acid concentration was measured by potentiometric titration using Metrohm 905 Titrando device. It was ensured that mass balance calculations have a maximum error of ±5% for radiometry and ±10% for ICP-AES analyses. All the experiments were carried out in a thermostated water bath maintained at temperature of 25 ± 2 °C."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Process solvent composition determination,"3.1 Process solvent composition determination DtBuCH18C6 dissolved in n-dodecane does not show appreciable extraction of strontium from 4 M nitric acid. As reported by Horwitz et al. [28] extraction of hydrated nitrate ions and its solvation by the diluent is necessary for extraction of strontium by DtBuCH18C6. Thus, in case of DtBuCH18C6 dissolved only in n-dodecane diluent, there is almost negligible extraction of hydrated nitrate ions due to high hydrophobic nature of n-dodecane. Adding an oxygenated aliphatic diluent like alcohols along with n-dodecane facilitates the solubility of water in organic phase resulting in extraction of hydrated nitrate ions and strontium by DtBuCH18C6. Here, a paraffinic branched alcohol, namely isodecyl alcohol is added to DtBuCH18C6/n-dodecane to facilitate the extraction of strontium. DtBuCH18C6 was found to have good solubility in isodecyl alcohol + n-dodecane mixture, with the increase in isodecyl alcohol content in the mixture the extraction of strontium increases. The results in variation of D Sr as a function of isodecyl alcohol concentration at different DtBuCH18C6 molarities (0.05–0.15 M) are shown in Fig. 2 . Extraction of strontium was low when DtBuCH18C6 was dissolved only in n-dodecane, extraction was found to increase with addition of isodecyl alcohol to the solvent for all the concentrations of DtBuCH18C6. From the results, it is clear that a higher concentration of isodecyl alcohol is more suitable for effective extraction of strontium. However, at isodecyl alcohol content above 50% (v/v), D Sr remains unchanged, this may be due to increase in nitric acid uptake with increase in isodecyl alcohol content of the solvent [14] which in turn interacts with DtBuCH18C6 and results in saturating the extraction capacity for strontium. As seen from the Fig. 2, for efficient extraction and stripping properties at desired acidities, 0.1 M DtBuDCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane was considered as appropriate process solvent for further studies. This solvent has not shown any third phase formation on saturation with high salt content HLW solution."
6,Extraction of strontium,"3.2 Extraction of strontium Extraction of strontium with 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane was evaluated with respect to the initial concentrations of HNO3, NO3 − and DtBuCH18C6. The results of D Sr dependency on HNO3 (initial) concentration for 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane is shown in Fig. 3 . A very small increase in D Sr was observed in lower region of nitric acid, at 0.5 M nitric acid concentration D Sr was 0.52, the increase is steep up to 8 M nitric acid (D Sr = 14.26) and then remains constant with further increase in nitric acid concentration without any decline in D Sr. The absence of leveling-off of D Sr at higher acidities can be explained by solvation of extracted nitric acid by isodecyl alcohol and thus preventing its interaction with crown ether. Participation of nitric acid in extracted complex formation is determined by plot of D Sr with nitric acid concentration at constant nitrate concentrations or at fixed ionic strength of 4.0 M (H,Na) NO3 (Fig. 4 ). The observed slope of 0.947 ± 0.02 suggests the presence of one mole of HNO3 in the extracted complex. The increase in nitric acid concentration favors the formation of organic soluble Sr2+.DtBuCH18C6.HNO3 adduct, thus, resulting in increase in D Sr. Extraction of strontium is almost negligible at lower nitric acid concentrations (≤0.1 M), therefore, this important property is used for stripping strontium from organic phase with deionized water. Fig. 5 shows the extractant dependency measurements for DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane at 4.0 M nitric acid. The slope of log–log plot is 1.21 ± 0.017, this value indicates 1:1 combining ratio of strontium and crown ether. Similar results are also reported for DtBuCH18C6 dissolved in 1-octanol or 1.2 M TBP-Isopar L diluents [10,11]. Role of counter anion on the extraction mechanism was determined from the plots of D Sr vs. [NO3 −]initial (Fig. 6 ) at constant nitric acid concentration. The results showed no change in D Sr with increase in nitrate ion concentration. Contrary to extraction behavior of most of the neutral extractants, this result suggests that nitrate ion is not participating in the strontium-crown ether complex formation. A quantitative explanation to this anomalous behavior is quite difficult considering the complexity of the biphasic solution equilibrium in these kinds of systems, however, a reasonable explanation can be given by the nature of strontium-crown ether complex formed and the polarity of organic medium. Slope analysis of the extractant and acid dependency plots indicated one strontium ion bonded with one molecule each of crown ether and HNO3 to give a cationic complex of type Sr2+·DtBuCH18C6·HNO3. This complex either remains ion paired with NO3 − ion to give Sr·DtBuCH18C6·HNO3·2NO3, or may remains dissociated from NO3 − ion to give free ions Sr2+·DtBuCH18C6·HNO3 and 2NO3 −. The extraction process may be thus represented as: (1) Sr2+ aq + 2NO3 − aq + DtBuCH18C6 org + HNO3 aq ⇄ Sr·DtBuCH18C6·HNO3·2NO3org (2) Sr2+ aq + 2NO3 − aq + DtBuCH18C6org + HNO3aq ⇄ Sr2+ · DtBuCH18C6·HNO3org + 2NO3 − org Ion-pairing as shown in Eq. (1) is favored by non-polar diluents with low dielectric constant such as paraffinic hydrocarbons, whereas, ion-pair dissociation (Eq. (2)) is favored in polar diluents like nitrobenzene [29]. In the present case the diluent used is 50% isodecyl alcohol + n-dodecane, the high concentration of polar isodecyl alcohol is expected to increase dielectric constant of the solvent which can predominantly support ion-dissociation extraction mechanism. Also, due to hydrogen bonding and electron pair donating ability of isodecyl alcohol, it can stabilize the cation and anion by solvation, thereby, increasing internuclear separations and preventing their close contact. Thus, the anomalous behavior of D Sr not depending on NO3 − ion concentration may be attributed to extraction mechanism following Eq. (2), where NO3 − ion is not a part of the strontium-crown ether complex. Variation of D Sr with strontium concentration for 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane is shown in Fig. 7 . D Sr remains nearly constant up to 3.0 mM (270 mg/L) of strontium, thereafter, D Sr decreases with increase in strontium concentration and sharp decrease was observed when the strontium in the aqueous phase was higher than 30 mM. At 350 mM, D Sr obtained was 0.39 which corresponds to extraction of about 0.098 M strontium in the organic phase, this value of strontium in the extract phase remains unchanged even at higher concentrations of strontium in the aqueous phase. The reason for this is the stoichiometry limit of 1:1 between strontium and crown ether."
7,Extraction of group II elements,"3.3 Extraction of group II elements Selectivity of strontium extraction from other group II elements present in HLW is important in view of recovery of 90Sr in high purity. In our HLW, calcium and barium are present in much more concentration compared to strontium, their concentrations are approximately 1120 and 375 mg/L respectively. Extraction of them dissolved in 4 M nitric acid was tested with 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane and the D values obtained are 0.015 for calcium and 0.2 for barium. A high selectivity of strontium extraction over calcium is observed but relatively lesser for barium. Extraction of strontium was measured with increase in concentration of calcium, the results showed no change in D Sr and high selectivity over calcium extraction (Table 2 )."
8,Batch extraction test of strontium from high salt content HLW,"3.4 Batch extraction test of strontium from high salt content HLW The results of distribution ratio measurements of metal constituents of HLW with 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane are summarized in Table 3 . It is seen that D Sr is much larger compared to other elements, however there is an extraction of plutonium and barium to some extent. Separation factor of more than 100 was obtained for Na, K, Al, Fe, Ln’s, U, Am and more than 10 for Pu and Ba. Extraction of plutonium is undesirable as it contaminate the 90Sr - 90Y recovery with alpha activity. Like trivalent americium which has shown almost no extraction, plutonium extraction can also be minimized by reducing plutonium (IV) (extractable species) to plutonium (III) (non-extractable species) by reductive extraction of plutonium in the presence of hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) [30]. 0.5 M HAN in feed solution of 4 M nitric acid was found sufficient in reducing Pu(IV) to Pu(III). The D Pu obtained under this condition was 0.02. Stripping of the loaded organic was carried by deionized water at equal phase ratio. In first contact almost 85% of the strontium was stripped, three consecutive contacts each with fresh deionized water results in complete stripping."
9,Stability test of 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane solvent,"3.5 Stability test of 0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane solvent The present studies have shown that DtBuCH18C6 dissolved in a mixture of isodecyl alcohol and n-dodecane is a promising extractant for strontium separation from high salt content HLW solution. Moreover, it is necessary to investigate the influence of acidity and radiation on the stability of the solvent. This was assessed by measuring the extraction and stripping efficiencies of the process solvent obtained after hydrolysis and radiolysis under controlled conditions. Hydrolysis was carried out by continuous stirring of equal volumes of solvent and 4 M nitric acid at 35–40 °C for three months (HLW is expected to have elevated temperature due to presence heat generating nuclides, 90Sr and 137Cs). After hydrolysis the organic sample was tested for D Sr at 4.0 M HNO3 (extraction condition) and at 0.01 M HNO3 (stripping condition). The solvent was found to retain its extraction and stripping properties at both the acidities indicating high hydrolytic stability of the solvent. Radiolytic degradation studies were carried out by irradiating the solvent in contact with equal volume of 4 M nitric acid by 60Co γ-source at a dose rate of 56 Gy/min up to cumulative dose of 0.6 MGy. The irradiated solvent after separating it from nitric acid was tested for extraction and stripping of strontium and the results are presented in Table 4 . The extraction of strontium, showed no appreciable change up to 0.2 MGy, however, beyond this there was slight decline in the extraction, but still the solvent retains its high extraction property (from 84% to 72%) up to an absorbed dose of 0.6 MGy. The stripping of the loaded organic at different absorbed dose was done by giving four successive contacts with 0.01 M nitric acid solution. There is almost no change seen in the stripping behavior of the irradiated solvent, it is because the degradation products of DtBuCH18C6 are non-acidic alcohols which do not interact with strontium during stripping process."
10,Conclusions,"0.1 M DtBuCH18C6 + 50% isodecyl alcohol/n-dodecane is found to be suitable solvent for separation of strontium from high salt content acidic HLW solution. The solvent showed increasing trend of D Sr with nitric acid concentration, optimum concentration of nitric acid for extraction and stripping is found to be 4 M and 0.01 M respectively. D Sr dependency on crown ether and nitric acid shows 1:1 complex formation of strontium with crown ether and nitric acid. Solvent exhibited high selectivity for strontium extraction, plutonium extraction to some extent was observed which was minimized by reductive extraction in the presence of 0.5 M hydroxylammonium nitrate. The solvent demonstrated fairly high stability towards hydrolysis and radiolysis. The experimental results obtained in this work would help to qualify the solvent for large scale separation of 90Sr from HLW."
