0,Introduction,"The current energy system based on fossil fuels is now facing two fundamental problems in sustainability: the depletion of fossil fuel and environmental pollution. This has led to an extensive search for new alternative energy sources and carriers [1]. Among various candidates, hydrogen is regarded as the most promising energy carrier, since it produces only water when combusted and has a 2.75 times higher energy yield (122kJ/g) than hydrocarbon fuels. In addition, as an automotive fuel, H2 can be easily applied in proton exchange membrane fuel cell vehicles as well as conventional internal combustion engines [2]. H2 can be made via several ways, including electrolysis of water, thermocatalytic reformation of hydrogen-rich organic compounds, and biological processes. Currently, H2 is exclusively made by steam reforming of gas, requiring electricity derived from fossil fuel combustion, a process that is energy intensive and expensive. Feedstock and energy for H2 production must be renewable if its purpose is to decrease the current dependency on fossil fuel. Sustainable generation of H2 may be achieved by a range of technologies, including biological processes [3]. Biological H2 production can be achieved by phototrophic and non-phototrophic methods. With the help of light, autotrophs such as algae and heterotrophs such as Rhodobacter sp. produce H2 from water and organic wastewater, respectively. However, phototrophic H2 production confronts several obstacles: (1) low solar energy conversion efficiency (2) slow reaction rate, and (3) low light penetration due to biofilm formation on the reactor wall. On the other hand, non-phototrophic production, often called fermentative H2 production (FHP), offers many advantages such as fast reaction rate, degradation of solid organic wastes, technical simplicity, and no need of light. As a result, it can serve to address two critical global issues simultaneously, energy supply and environmental protection [4]. FHP is one of the ways releasing excess electrons derived from organics with the help of the ‘hydrogenase’ function in bacteria. The following equations, Eqs. (1) and (2), are the main H2 production reactions involved in FHP from glucose. Comprehensive studies have been conducted dealing with operating parameters such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), carbon source, and H2 partial pressure [5]. However, little information is available about the effect of cations on FHP. (1) Glucose+2 H2O→2 Acetate+2 CO2 +4 H2 +4 ATP (2) Glucose→Butyrate+2 CO2 +2 H2 +2 ATP Cations play essential roles in adenosine (ATP) synthesis, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) oxidation/reduction, and enzyme activity, thereby accelerating microbial metabolism if maintained at proper concentrations. However, excessive cations can cause plasmolysis and loss of cell activity by creating high osmotic pressure and improper enzyme linkages. In particular, sodium, the main cation in biomass and seawater, leads to many problems in biological treatment systems of wastewater from seafood processing, the dairy industry, and chemical production. Besides, sodium concentration can be increased by buffer addition such as NaOH, Na2CO3, and NaHCO3. Therefore, research has been carried out on anaerobic digestion and biological nutrient removal processes to identify the inhibition mechanisms and alleviation of its inhibition [6,7]. For methane fermentation, it has generally been reported that sodium concentration over 2g Na+/L will cause a performance drop [8,9]. However, some studies have reported that continuous exposure of microorganisms to higher sodium levels increased the sodium tolerance. Seafood processing wastewater containing 5–12g/L of sodium was successfully treated with an anaerobic filter process [10]. According to Feijoo et al. [11], sodium concentration causing 50% inhibition exceeded 10g Na+/L for the sludge obtained from digesters treating high saline wastewater, but it was lower than 5g Na+/L when unacclimated sludge was used. Also, a stepwise increase of sodium level exhibited higher tolerance than a shock increase [12]. These findings suggest that acclimation could mitigate sodium inhibition. There are two known bacterial strategies to adapt to and cope with high sodium concentration; salt-in and compatible-solute strategies [13]. The main mechanism in the salt-in strategy is the extrusion of sodium ions outside cells concurrent with accumulation of potassium ions inside cells via a proton electrochemical gradient and at ATP expense. As this strategy does not reduce the osmotic pressure inside the cell, all intracellular systems should be tolerant at high osmotic pressure. On the other hand, in the compatible-solutes strategy, compatible solutes such as glycerol, ectoine, and glycine betaine are created for the proper functions of intracellular systems at high osmotic pressure. Debate continues over which strategy is more energy efficient, but it is clear that life in a salty environment is costly. Although salty organic substances, such as waste from the foodstuff industry, could be suitable sources for FHP and sodium is employed as the cation in general buffers and nutrients for FHP, research on this subject is scarce. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the sodium inhibition of FHP. Chronic and acute sodium toxicity was investigated by continuous-stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) operation and batch tests at various sodium concentrations, respectively."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate The seed sludge was taken from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.5, 2.83g CaCO3/L, and 5.3g/L, respectively. The sludge was heat-treated at 90°C for 15min to inactivate hydrogen consumers and to harvest spore-forming anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium sp. [14]. Sucrose of 25g COD/L was used as a substrate. Concentrations of NH4Cl, KH2PO4, and FeCl2·4H2O were added to yield a COD:N:P:Fe ratio of 100:5:1:0.33. Feed also contained the following nutrients (in mg/L): NaHCO3 1000; MgCl2·6H2O 100; CaCl2·2H2O 75; Na2MoO4·4H2O 0.01; H3BO3 0.05; MnCl2·4H2O 0.5; ZnCl2 0.05; CuCl2 0.03; NiCl2·6H2O 0.05; CoCl2·2H2O 0.5; Na2SeO3 0.05 [14]."
3,Continuous operation,"2.2 Continuous operation In this study, a CSTR with a working volume of 5.0L (325mm high by 140mm ID) was used. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate was maintained at 50g/Ld during the entire period of operation, which corresponded to 12h of hydraulic retention time (HRT). The reactor was mixed by mechanical stirring at 100rpm. The pH was maintained at 5.3±0.1 using a pH sensor, pH controller, and 3N KOH. Biogas production was monitored by the water displacement method and then corrected to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP). All experiments were conducted in a constant temperature room at 35±1°C. After being seeded with heat-treated sludge equivalent to 30% of the total effective volume, the reactor was purged with N2 gas for 5min to provide an anaerobic condition, and then operated in batch mode. When the H2 yield reached 0.2molH2/mol hexoseadded in the batch operation, continuous operation started [15]. The CSTR was fed with low-sodium influent containing 0.27g Na+/L by NaHCO3 (buffer solution) for 70 days; 30 days for start-up and 40 days as the control condition (Phase I). Subsequently, sodium chloride was added to increase the sodium concentration to: 2.41 (Phase II), 5.36 (Phase III), and 10.14g Na+/L (Phase IV-1) according to the batch test results using the control biomass. As H2 production failure was observed at Phase IV-1, sodium concentration decreased to 8.12 (Phase IV-2), 6.61 (Phase IV-3), and 5.36g Na+/L (Phase V) at further operation. At each phase, the reactor was operated at least 10 days, 20 times of HRT, in order to establish steady-state conditions, judging from metabolic products."
4,Batch test,"2.3 Batch test The inocula for batch tests were biomass collected from the continuous reactor acclimated at different sodium concentrations (Phases I, II, and III). The sludge was anaerobically centrifuged at 672g for 30min to eliminate any salt present in the mixed liquor and avoid uncontrolled antagonistic or synergistic effects. Batch experiments were conducted using fermenters (635mL) equipped with a pH sensor and magnetic mixing bar. Each batch fermenter contained 1g of the centrifuged sludge having 185–190mg VSS/g, 20mL of nutrient stock solutions (5×) to yield the same final concentration as CSTR, and a predetermined amount of NaCl stock solution (40g Na+/L). Sodium toxicity levels were varied for each fermenter; 0.27 (control), 3.00, 6.00, 9.00, 12.00, 15.00, 18.00, and 21.00g Na+/L. Distilled water was added into the fermenters to adjust the final volume to 100ml. The large headspace volume (535mL) was to alleviate the adverse effect of high H2 partial pressure during fermentation. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.00±0.05 by 3N KOH and HCl. The bottles were then purged with N2 gas, and placed in a water bath with a magnetic stirrer. Mixing speed and temperature were controlled at 100rpm and 35±1°C, respectively. Biogas production and its constituents were measured periodically from each bottle to estimate H2 production. As acids are produced during fermentation, resulting in a pH drop, 3N KOH was added to maintain the pH above 5.0±0.2. Organic acids, alcohols, and remaining substrate were measured after H2 production ceased."
5,Methodology,2.4 Methodology The modified Gompertz equation was employed in this study to describe the cumulative H2 production in the batch tests [16]. (3) H ( t ) = P · exp { − exp [ R ′ · ⅇ P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H(t)=cumulative H2 production (mL) at cultivation time t (h); P =H2 production potential (mL); R′ =H2 production rate (mL/h); λ=lag period (h); and e=exp(1)=2.71828. The inhibitory effect of sodium on specific H2 production activity (SHPA) was analyzed using a noncompetitive inhibition model as shown in Eq. (4) [17]. (4) R = R 0 ( 1 − I I ∗ ) n where R =specific H2 production rate at inhibitor concentrations of I (mLH2/gVSS/h); R 0 =specific hydrogen production rate without an added inhibitor (mLH2/gVSS/h); I =inhibitor concentration (g/L); I∗ =lethal inhibitor concentration beyond which the reaction cannot proceed (g/L); and n =constant.
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Measured biogas production was corrected to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP). Hydrogen content in the biogas was determined by a gas chromatography (GC, Gow Mac series 580) using a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.8m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A with N2 as a carrier gas. The contents of CH4, N2, and CO2 were measured using a GC of the same model noted previously with a 1.8m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with porapak Q (80/100mesh) using helium as a carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50°C, respectively, in both GCs. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C2–C6) and lactate were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Finnigan Spectra SYSTEM LC, Thermo Electron Co.) with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector (UV1000, Thermo Electron) and an 100mm×7.8mm Fast Acid Analysis column (Bio-Rad Lab.) using 0.005M H2SO4 as a mobile phase. Aliphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A, Dionex) and a 250mm×9mm IonPac ICE-AS1 column (Dionex) using 50mM HClO4 as a mobile phase. The liquid samples were pretreated with a 0.45μm membrane filter prior to injection to both HPLCs. COD and VSS were measured according to Standard Methods [18]. Glucose concentration was determined by the colorimetric method [19]."
7,Microbial analysis,"2.6 Microbial analysis In order to analyze the microbial communities, the DNAs in the sludge sampled at each sparging condition were extracted using the Ultraclean Soil DNA Kit (Cat # 12800-50; Mo Bio Laboratory Inc., USA). The 16S rDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The region corresponding to positions 357 and 518 in the 16S rDNA of Escherichia coli was PCR-amplified using the forward primer EUB357f (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) with a GC clamp (5′-CGCCCG CCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCC-3′) at the 5′ end to stabilize the melting behavior of the DNA fragments and the reverse primer UNIV518r (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′). PCR amplification was conducted in an automated thermal cycler (MWG-Bio TECH, Germany) using the protocol; that is, initial denaturation for 4min at 94°C, annealing for 40s at 55°C, extension for 1min at 72°C, followed by a final extension for 8min at 72°C. PCR mixtures had a final volume of 50μl of 10×PCR buffer, 0.8mM MgSO4, 0.5mM of each primer, 0.1mM dNTP, 25pg template and 1U polymerase. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel in 1×TAE for 30min for 50V, and then checked with ethidium bromide staining to confirm the amplification. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was carried out using the Dcode Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instruments. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1×TAE buffer for 480min at 70V and 60°C on polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) containing a linear gradient ranging from 40% to 60% denaturant. After electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 30min, and then visualized on UV transilluminator. Most of the bands were excised from DGGE polyacrylamide gel for 16S rDNA sequencing. DNAs were eluted from the excised bands by immersing them in 20μl of Tris EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for one day, and then PCR-amplified with the forward primer EUB357f without a GC clamp and the reverse primer UNIV518r. After PCR amplification, PCR products were purified with using Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold (MILLIPORE com., USA). All the strands of the purified PCR products were sequenced with primers EUB357f by ABIPRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Search of the GenBank database was conducted using the BLAST program."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Acute sodium toxicity,"3.1 Acute sodium toxicity Acute sodium toxicity of control biomass (Phase I) was severe as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 . H2 production decreased almost by half at 3.00g Na+/L and decreased further at higher sodium concentrations. As the H2 production was negligible at more than 15.00g Na+/L, Eq (3) was only applied at concentrations lower than 12.00g Na+/L. The lag period was also increased with sodium concentration, indicating that shock loading of sodium could result in the failure of H2 production. The pH profile shown in Fig. 2 confirms the retardation in microbial catabolism by sodium inhibition. The pH value dropped to 5.0 within 2h up to 6.00g Na+/L, suggesting that the biomass could readily adapt to 6.00g Na+/L. However, it took more than 5h when the sodium concentration was more than 12.00g Na+/L. SHPA (mLH2/g VSS/h) of the control biomass at various sodium concentrations was well fitted by Eq (4) with a high R 2 value of 0.974 (graph not shown), and the sodium concentrations causing 30, 60, and 90% inhibition were found: 2.41, 5.36, and 10.14g Na+/L, respectively. Effects of sodium on SHPA, H2 yield (HY), and substrate removal efficiency of biomass acclimated at different sodium concentrations are illustrated in Fig. 3(a), (b), and (c), respectively. The SHPA and HY at various sodium concentrations are expressed as “the percentage (%) of the control, the results from the batch test at 0.27g Na+/L using each biomass”. Acclimation substantially alleviated the acute sodium toxicity. Using the acclimated biomass the SHPA and HY were close to or even higher than those of the control at up to 6.00g Na+/L. The highest HY was observed at 3.00 and 6.00g Na+/L when the biomass acclimated at 2.41 and 5.46g Na+/L was used, respectively. This might be attributable to the osmotic pressure formed inside the cells during the acclimation period. A drop in the sodium concentration outside of the cell would facilitate the permeation of water molecules into the cell, which would in turn adversely affect the metabolic balance. Also, acclimation showed a positive effect on substrate removal efficiency. The concentration maintaining over 90% of substrate removal efficiency was increased to 12.00, 15.00, and 18.00g Na+/L when using the control and acclimated biomass at 2.41 and 5.46g Na+/L, respectively. At 12.00g Na+/L, in spite of high substrate removal, H2 production was 50% less than the control even when using acclimated biomass. This suggests that the metabolic pathway was shifted to a non-hydrogenic route by sodium inhibition under acute toxicity condition. As arranged in Table 2 , butyrate, lactate, and acetate were the major soluble microbial products of FHP. Interestingly, metabolic shift from butyrate to lactate was concurrent with sodium inhibition. For example, when using the control biomass, the butyrate portion decreased from 29.7% to 4.7% as the sodium concentration was increased up to 12.00g Na+/L. Instead, lactate production was predominant, accounting for 65.6% of the total organic acids. It is known that butyrate production is accompanied by H2 production (Eq. (2)), while all lactate producing reactions are non-hydrogenic as shown in Eqs. (5) and (6) [20]. (5) Glucose→2 Lactate+2 ATP (6) Glucose→Lactate+Ethanol+CO2 +1 ATP Although it is generally accepted that both acetate and butyrate productions provide high H2 production in pure culture, previous studies in using mixed culture showed a close relationship between butyrate and H2 production rather than acetate production. It was reported that H2 yield was linearly proportional to butyrate production or B/A (butyrate/acetate) ratio and doubts were even raised regarding whether the governing acetate production pathway in mixed culture was a H2-consuming reaction as shown in the following Eq. (7) [14,21]. (7) 4 H2 +2 CO2 →Acetate+2 H2O+(1–2) ATP To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a relation between lactate production with sodium inhibition in FHP. Previously, Xialong et al. [22] observed a gradual change of metabolic products from acetate, propionate, and butyrate to acetate with increasing sodium concentration, but did not report on lactate. The lactate production could result from either the microbial population change, which is discussed in 3.3 Microbial analysis, or the switched catabolic pathway of H2-producing bacteria. Lactate production is not commonly caused by main anaerobic H2-producing bacteria, Clostridium sp., under normal conditions. Thus far, its production is only reported when (1) H2 release is blocked; (2) hydrogenase activity is inhibited by carbon monoxide; or (3) iron or sulfur supply is limited [21]. Further study using a pure culture might reveal whether the metabolic pathway of Clostridium sp. could be altered by sodium inhibition or not."
10,Chronic toxicity,"3.2 Chronic toxicity Fig. 4 shows the daily variations of volumetric H2 production rate (VHPR) at various sodium concentrations. Although VHPR fluctuated at Phase III (5.36g Na+/L), average values at Phase II (2.41g Na+/L) and Phase III were higher than those at Phase I (0.27g Na+/L), which did not correspond with the batch test results using the control biomass. In Phase IV-1 (10.14g Na+/L), a sudden deterioration of H2 production was observed, and was not recovered at further operation with lower sodium concentrations (8.12, 6.61, and 5.36g Na+/L). The acute sodium toxicity evaluated by a batch test using the control biomass and chronic sodium toxicity obtained in continuous operation are compared in Fig. 5 . Under acute toxicity conditions, sufficient time is not provided for the biomass to adapt at the higher sodium concentration, and thus a steep decline of SHPA was shown. Meanwhile, in continuous operation, the biomass has sufficient time to adapt and retain their activity. At 5.00g Na+/L, the activity was decreased by 50% in the acute condition, but only 15% in the chronic condition. This adaptation effect was also observed for substrate removal efficiency. The average continuous performances of FHP at each phase are listed in Table 3 . H2 content and yield decreased with increasing sodium concentration, but the substrate removal efficiency increased due probably to the adaptation mechanism requiring more energy at a salty environment. Also, the biomass concentration increased as the substrate utilization increased. Table 4 summarizes the overall COD balance of H2, organic acids, alcohols, and biomass. The COD of biomass was calculated under the assumption that its chemical formula was C5H7O2N [24]. The COD balance was roughly 100±5% in Phases I, II, and III, but only 87% in Phases IV and V, suggesting that compatible solutes were formed for survival at the high salty condition and their leak to the broth. Several studies reported the leakage of compatible solutes such as betaines, ectoines, N-acetylated diamino acids, and N-derivatized carboxamides of glutamine as cell membranes were not perfectly impermeable to low-molecular-weight substances [13]. The butyrate portion decreased while lactate portion increased at a high sodium concentration, which agreed well with the batch test results. The portion of propionate, a by-product of the H2-consuming reaction, also increased at Phases IV and V. The reasons for the change of liquid state by-products distribution in continuous operation are discussed in 3.3 Microbial analysis."
11,Microbial analysis,"3.3 Microbial analysis Fig. 6 illustrates the DGGE profiles of the 16S rDNA gene fragment amplified from the biomass sampled in Phases I–V I–V. The major bands were excised and purified to determine the sequence. Table 5 shows the results of the sequence affiliation, and isolated microorganisms and their main metabolites from the carbohydrate [23,25–32]. In total, 10 bands were detected. While similar band types were observed in Phases I, II, and III, they were changed significantly in Phases IV and V. H2-producing bacteria, Clostridium pasteurianum, and non H2-producing bacteria such as Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum and Acetobacter aceti were detected in Phases I, II, and III. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus bovis and propionic acid bacteria (PAB), Selenomonas sp., were only detected in Phases IV and V. As LAB and PAB were not capable of H2 production, this population shift could be linked to a decrease of H2 production with an increase of lactate and propionate productions in Phases IV and V. Sodium tolerance of LAB and PAB would be better than that of H2-producing bacteria. Recently, halotolerant L. lactis, which could be active up to 20g Na+/L has been isolated from the intestinal tract of coastal fish [33]. Irrecoverable H2 production at Phase V also could be explained by the abundant preexistence of non H2-producing bacteria obtained at Phase IV. Similarly, there has been one report concluding that salinity level impacted the composition of microbial communities. In an anaerobic sulfate removal reactor, the removal efficiency decreased at a sodium concentration of 5.0g Na+/L, which was attributed to a decrease of the sulfate reducing bacteria dominancy [34]. As the drastic H2 production drop was accompanied with a microbial community, which resulted in irrecoverable performance, special care must be taken when the sodium concentration is increased. It is recommended that the sodium concentration be increased stepwise between 5 and 10g Na+/L when a salty substance is fed to FHP."
12,Conclusions,"Acute sodium toxicity was evaluated by several batch tests using acclimated biomass collected from the continuous reactor operated at different sodium concentrations of 0.27 (control), 2.41, and 5.46g Na+/L. Unlike the control biomass, which exhibited a monotonic decrease of HPA with increasing sodium concentration from 0.27 to 21.00g Na+/L, the acclimated biomass maintained their activity at a concentration lower than 6.00g Na+/L. Sudden exposure of the biomass to higher sodium concentration inhibited the substrate removal efficiency and microbial catabolism. However, the H2 production drop was mainly attributed to a change of the metabolic pathway favorable to lactate production while depressing butyrate production. On the other hand, as the biomass is allowed sufficient time to adapt to the chronic toxicity condition, HPA was well maintained up to 5.36g Na+/L. However, an irrecoverable H2 production drop was observed at 10.14g Na+/L with a significant increase of lactate and propionate production. A PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that the salty environment rendered the microbial community unfavorable to H2 production. LAB such as L. lactis, L. delbrueckii, and S. bovis and PAB, Selenomonas sp., were only detected at Phases IV and V."
