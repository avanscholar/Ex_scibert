0,Introduction,"Ever since the discovery of phosphorus-type ligands for the hydroformylation reaction in the 1960s, [1] they have been the most commonly used type of ligands in homogeneous catalysis.[2] Throughout the years, chemists have developed a deep understanding about their role in catalysis, resulting in a wide variety of different ones known in literature [3–6] or commercially available.[7] Contrary to the amount of knowledge about them, there are still reactions where they seem to have no great success. One of these reactions is the rhodium catalyzed reductive hydroformylation. Reductive hydroformylation describes the tandem-catalyzed transformation of olefins into alcohols as shown in Fig. 1 . With alcohols being one of the most important subsequent products of hydroformylation reactions, and hydroformylation being the biggest homogeneously catalyzed process with an annual production of over 12 million tons, [2,8] an efficient protocol for the one-step synthesis would be highly beneficial. Already from the very start of hydroformylation reactions, non-modified cobalt catalysts are known to directly yield alcohols as products, although under harsh conditions.[9] Later, a wide variety of rhodium and ruthenium catalysts in combination with phosphorus based ligands have been investigated.[10,11] To the best of our knowledge, up until now the most active reaction system utilizing phosphorus-based ligands was reported in 2012 by the group led by Vogt, using a rhodium/xantphos catalyst in the conversion of 1-octene.[12] Nevertheless, to date, no tandem-catalytic system was found which shows sufficient activity and which has the potential to compete with state-of-the-art two-step processes that are common practice in industry.[2] The main challenge remains to find a single catalyst, which at the same time shows high activity for the hydroformylation and hydrogenation step. Some recently reported catalytic systems by the groups led by Beller, Nozaki and our group solved this issue by using two distinctive catalysts, a rhodium based catalyst for the hydroformylation step and a ruthenium based catalyst for the hydrogenation step.[11,13,14] An alternative to phosphorus based ligands was already proposed back in 1972 by the group led by Fell. The use of N-methylpyrrolidine in combination with rhodium oxide led to the transformation of 1–octene to n–nonanol in high activity, even though high pressures of about 150 bar were needed.[15] Two years later, Jurewicz et al. reported the reductive hydroformylation of 1-hexene with rhodium in the presence of triethylamine at much lower pressures. Only 40 years later, in 2012, the group led by Alper presented the reductive hydroformylation of styrene with the addition of bidentate tertiary amines.[16] More recently, our group reported the reductive hydroformylation of tricyclopentadiene using triethylamine in combination with a rhodium precursor[17] and the group led by Monflier reported the transformation of unsaturated triglycerides to alcohols using a rhodium/trialkylamine catalyst.[18] Although the use of amines seems to be a very promising attempt, until now little or nothing is known about their role during the reaction. Whitehurst assumed that the amine does not bind to the rhodium center but instead supports the formation of negatively charged rhodium clusters.[19] In later literature, it is mostly assumed that the amine acts as a ligand based on experimental observations. Because tertiary amines have strong σ-donor but almost no π-back-bonding capability,[20,21] the binding of the amine is not self-evident. Hence, in order to surpass the status of a purely phenomenological approach, the role and influence of the tertiary amine must be clarified. In this publication, important parameters and constraints will be examined. Later on, electronic and steric properties of amine ligands will be linked to their catalytic outcome. Spectroscopic techniques such as NMR- and IR-spectroscopy are then used to identify the influence of the amine on a molecular level."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Initial reaction system and amine concentration,"2.1 Initial reaction system and amine concentration The first step was to elaborate an active catalytic system for the reaction. Based on the known literature, we chose to start with triethylamine as the amine additive. Triethylamine showed the highest activity during previous investigations of our group.[17] For comparability reasons, 1-octene was chosen as the model substrate. 1-Octene readily undergoes hydroformylation and has been used frequently as the model substrate in the existing literature concerning reductive hydroformylation.[22–24] Fig. 2 shows the reaction pathway and possible side reactions for the reductive hydroformylation of 1-octene (1). The first step is the hydroformylation to the linear (n) and branched (iso) aldehyde (2a + b). Hydrogenation of the aldehydes leads to the corresponding alcohols (3a + b). The most important ancillary reactions are the hydrogenation of the starting olefin to alkanes (4) and the isomerization of the double bond to alkene isomers (5). While isomerization is reversible and alkene isomers can even undergo reductive hydroformylation themselves (6, 7), hydrogenated starting material (4) is lost for the reaction. After an extensive screening of precursors (Supporting Information S 1.1), the combination of [Rh(acac)(CO)2] with triethylamine proved to be successful (Table 1 , entry 1.1). Already in these first attempts, a yield of 85% alcohol was achieved in 87% selectivity to alcohols within eight hours of reaction time. The observation of low activity in the olefin hydrogenation (4) is particularly important. Due to its similarity in nature to the aldehyde hydrogenation, hydrogenation of the starting olefin is commonly observed in reductive hydroformylation reactions.[10] Nevertheless, high catalyst loadings and long reaction times are needed at this point, attributing to a low catalytic activity. We started our investigations of this reaction system by identifying important parameters, which show high impact on the catalytic activity. Whenever almost full conversion was achieved, the catalyst load or reaction time was lowered to differentiate activity changes. When trying to lower the catalyst concentration, an unusual drop in activity for the hydrogenation step can be observed. Going from a catalyst concentration of 1.5 mol% (entry 1.2) to 1 mol% (entry 1.3), the alcohol yield drops from 48% to 9%. The main products are intermediate aldehydes. This severe drop in hydrogenation activity implies that there is also a change in the nature of the catalytically active species. Since the only parameter which is changed together with the catalyst is the amine concentration, its effect on the catalytic activity was investigated subsequently (entry 1.4–1.8). At a constant catalyst concentration of 1.5 mol%, lowering the rhodium to amine ratio to 1:2 again led to a significant drop in activity of the hydrogenation step and only 1% alcohol products were observed (entry 1.4). This is in accordance with the activity drop observed for the catalyst concentration. In contrast, increasing the amine to rhodium ratio accelerates the hydrogenation. Up to a Rh:NEt3 ratio of 1:400, the yield of alcohols increases to 82% (entry 1.7). When the amine concentration is increased further and triethylamine is used as neat solvent (entry 1.8), the hydroformylation step is inhibited with the consequence of a low total conversion of 49%. The results confirm that the activity drop initially observed is indeed linked to a decrease in the amine concentration rather than the catalyst concentration. The weak binding of the σ-donor amines could be the reason that a high excess of amine is needed to enable the formation of possible amine complexes. The observation of a selectivity change in this respect hints that the amine is mainly responsible for the hydrogenation activity of the system. A similar boost in hydrogenation activity is a well-known phenomenon in hydoaminomethylation reactions, where rhodium/phosphorus catalysts show hydrogenation activity in the presence of amines.[25,26]"
3,Carbon monoxide competing for the metal center,"2.2 Carbon monoxide competing for the metal center A strong dependency on the concentration can also be observed for the CO partial pressure (Fig. 3 ). Because full conversion was achieved during the previous experiments, the reaction time was lowered to 1.5 h to observe activity changes. In the three experiments on the left-hand side of Fig. 3, the synthesis gas composition was varied at a constant pressure of 30 bar. The highest hydrogenation activity, with a total alcohol yield of 47%, is reached at a synthesis gas composition of CO:H2 1:2 (c) and a carbon monoxide partial pressure of 10 bar. An increase in the carbon monoxide partial pressure (a, b) reduces the activity for hydroformylation, resulting in lower total conversions. On the other hand, decreasing the carbon monoxide partial pressure (d) abolishes the hydrogenation activity. Low alcohol yields of 11% are the result. Similar behavior can be observed when varying the total gas pressure. Higher carbon monoxide partial pressures (h, i) reduce the hydroformylation activity, while lower carbon monoxide pressures (f) drastically reduce hydrogenation activity. The fact that this behavior for the synthesis gas composition and the total pressure can be linked to the carbon monoxide partial pressure and are not individual trends is proven in the combined experiment (e). When both the total pressure and the synthesis gas ratio are increased, resulting in a carbon monoxide pressure of 10 bar, high yields of alcohol (52%) are observed, while as described above, increasing the total pressure and synthesis gas composition individually led to lower activity. A dependency on the CO partial pressure is already described for several phosphine based catalysts used in hydroformylation reactions.[27–29] In this case, there seems to be a strong impact on the hydrogenation activity. A similar effect for the hydrogenation step with Rh/amine catalysts was reported in literature for the one-pot two-step hydroformylation/hydrogenation of very high olefinic sunflower oil.[30] The strong dependency of the catalytic activity on the amine concentration and the carbon monoxide partial pressure highlights the sensitivity of the equilibrium for the catalytically active species. An explanation would be the competition between carbon monoxide and triethylamine for the rhodium center. In further experiments, a brief screening of solvents and the influence of the reaction temperature was investigated. Further information can be found in the supporting information (supporting information S 1.2)."
4,Systematic investigation of amine properties,"2.3 Systematic investigation of amine properties Assuming that the amine binds to the metal center during the catalytic cycle, a strong influence on the catalytic performance is expected depending on the nature of the amine, similar to phosphorus-type ligands.[2] In order to better identify important constraints, a systematization was chosen to identify the interaction between steric and electronic properties of tertiary amines and their catalytic activity. A well-known parameter for e.g. phosphorus ligands in order to estimate the steric hindrance is the cone angle.[31] The cone angle describes the average angle between the metal atom and the outermost edges of the van der Waals spheres of the ligand. Thus far, only a few examples of cone angles for tertiary amines can be found in literature.[32,33] In order to determine the cone angles for a wide variety of tertiary amines, it was assumed that the amine binds to the metal center. The molecular structure was optimized and the cone angle was calculated with the help of a Mathematica tool designed by Allen and his group.[33] In order to make the cone angles of the monodentate amines comparable to Tolman–angles, which are often described for phosphine type ligands, the amine cone angles are optimized binding to [Ni(CO)4L]. More detailed information about the computational methods and tabled data can be found in the supporting information (S 1.4 and S 1.5). A comparison of three angles calculated using this method, which are also published in literature, shows good accordance (Table 2 ). The basicity of the tested amines was used to represent their electronic properties. For amines, the basicity can be used as a very good approximation for the overall electron donor capacity since they are mostly σ–donors.[20,21] In total, the cone angles of eleven monodentate and two bidentate amines were determined and tested regarding their catalytic activity. The obtained results are plotted against the pK a of tested amines in Fig. 4 . Amines with cone angles between 132° (IV) and 238° (XI) and pKa values between 0.86 (I) and 11.51 (IX) were tested. Cone angles above 173° can only be realized with bidentate amines. Within the range of investigated amines, pKa values lower than 8.5 and for cone angles above 160° resulted in only minor alcohol yields, the highest being 7% for tetramethylethylenediamine (XIII). For all monodentate phenylamines (I, II, X), no conversion to alcohols was detected at all. Only the combination of the right steric and electronic properties resulted in high alcohol yields. All investigated amines with a pK a between 8.5 and 11.5 and at the same time a cone angle between 135° and 149° showed high activity, with triethylamine (IIX) and methyldiethylamine (VII) achieving the highest alcohol yields (62%). Interestingly, the linear to branched ratio, which is determined in the hydroformylation step, seems to be influenced in particular by the basicity of the amine, while the cone angle seems to have only a minor effect. This could hint that the amine cone angle plays an important role in the hydrogenation step of the reaction while the hydroformylation step seems to be mostly unaffected. The vast differences in catalytic activity highlight the importance of the amine properties. The strong steric influence in particular further suggests that the amines do indeed bind to the metal center. Another application of this map is to help estimate future amines with regard to their performance as additives in the rhodium catalyzed reductive hydroformylation."
5,Reductive hydroformylation of 1-octene with optimized conditions,"2.4 Reductive hydroformylation of 1-octene with optimized conditions With the insights gained during the previous investigations, new parameters under optimized reaction conditions were applied to the hydroformylation of 1-octene (Table 3 ). Because of the high activity, it was possible to decrease the catalyst concentration even further to 0.5 mol%. Under optimized conditions, 70% nonanol is generated within 1.5 h (entry 3.1). The only notable side product is the isomerization of initial 1-octene. In order to display the robustness of the catalytic species, a similar experiment was performed under optimized conditions, with the addition of 1 bar of ambient air. No notable decrease in the catalytic activity, change in selectivity or the precipitation of Rh(0) was observed in the presence of oxygen (entry 3.2). Since the isomerization reaction is an equilibrium, almost full conversion to alcohols can be achieved by prolonging the reaction time (entry 3.3). Interestingly, when the reaction time is prolonged to 16 h, branched products resulting from the hydroformylation of isomerized 2–octene were detected which had never been observed in previous experiments, leading to a decrease of the l:b ratio to 1.6. With the optimized conditions, a TOF of 93 h−1 is achieved. This is a significant increase compared to previously reported reaction systems for the reductive hydroformylation using amine ligands, and one of the most active reported catalytic systems for the rhodium catalyzed reductive hydroformylation in general.[10]"
6,Spectral examination of the catalytic species,"2.5 Spectral examination of the catalytic species Previous experimental results, but especially the strong influence of the steric constraints of the amine, suggests a ligand type effect of the amine. To further characterize the catalytic rhodium species n and to gain insights into the effect of the amine on the catalytic species, a combination of 13C- and 103Rh-, in situ 1H-Nuclear-Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy (NMR) and Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate the catalyst on a molecular level. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of rhodium bound carbonyls are shown in Fig. 5 . After heating a 13CO labeled catalyst solution for one hour under reaction conditions, the presence of several anionic rhodium–carbonyl species was evident. A 2D 13C-103Rh-HMBC spectrum helped to determine the 103Rh chemical shifts of the species observed in the 13C NMR previously. By comparison with literature data, we were able to identify the three anionic rhodium carbonyl-cluster species [Rh7(CO)16]3−, [Rh4(CO)11]2−, [Rh6(CO)15]2− and the mononuclear anionic complex [Rh(CO)4]− (Fig. 6 ).[34,35] 13C NMR experiments at different temperatures and times revealed a sensible equilibrium between the different species (supporting information S 2.4). In addition, it was possible to proof the presence of [Rh7(CO)16]3−, [Rh4(CO)11]2− and [Rh(CO)4]− also in a less concentrated reaction solution after 1.5 h of reaction time by using 13CO labeled synthesis gas and measuring under 13CO atmosphere (Fig. 7 ). It is known that anionic rhodium-carbonyl clusters can be formed in presence of amines and that [Rh(CO)4]− acts as the main reagent involved in the chemistry around the transformation of the different species.[36,37] Ammonium cations act as counter ions for the negatively charged complexes e.g. in the form of [HNEt3]+[Rh(CO)4]−. Although the formation of the anionic species is not utterly surprising, it cannot explain the catalytic activity and the strong dependency of the reaction on the steric hindrance of the tertiary amine. Additionally, for both reaction steps rhodium-hydride species must be involved. To further investigate on the role of the tertiary amine as counter cation, we tested several other counter cations (NEt4 +Cl−, PNP+Cl−, PPh3Me+Br−), the base kaliumhydroxide (KOH) and a combination of NEt4 +Cl− and KOH in the reductive hydroformylation of 1-octene. Although the formation of [Rh(CO)4]− in presence of KOH is described in literature[38] and NEt4 +Cl− is known to act as counter cation for anionic rhodium species similar to less alkylated amine salts[37], no conversion to alcohols (>1%) was observed during all experiments (supporting information S 1.6). It is therefore unlikely that the role of the tertiary amine in the reductive hydroformylation is just that of a counter cation or base for the formation of negatively charged rhodium-carbonyl species. Similar to the reactivity in presence of tertiary amines described for our reaction system, the formation of ethylene glycol from synthesis gas in presence of [HNEt3]+[Rh(CO)4]− was described by Wada et al. back in 1986. Also for this reaction, the employment of other bases or counter ions did not lead to the desired product.[39] It was suggested that for the catalytic reaction an amine hydride species is formed from the ionic complex as described in formula (1). (1) HNE t 3 + Rh CO 4 - ⇌ + CO - CO HRh CO 3 NEt 3 In this case the trialkylammonium ion serves as hydrogen source for the formation of the catalytically active hydride species. Because it was not possible to detect any hydride signals under the previous NMR conditions (room temperature, 3 bar syn-gas pressure), a pressure resistant sapphire-tube was used to monitor the catalyst formation under reaction conditions (30 bar CO:H2 1:2, T = 0 °C to 100 °C). We started by monitoring the 1H NMR spectrum of a concentrated catalyst solution with triethylamine at different temperatures (Fig. 8 ). Under syn-gas pressure several hydride species can be observed. The main species over a wide range of temperatures seems to be a rhodium-hydride complex with a 1H chemical shift of −18.7 ppm (at 100 °C). In addition at 100 °C a hydride species with a strongly shielded signal at −26.2 ppm is observed. At 25 °C a third species at −12.4 ppm and between 40 °C and 60 °C another species around −20 ppm might exist but cannot be distinctively identified because of a low signal to noise ratio. Since the catalyst is active for the reductive hydroformylation over a temperature range between 60 °C and 100 °C it is likely that especially the hydride species at −18.7 ppm plays a vital role for the reaction. Although no clear identification of coupling constants is possible, the signal at −26.2 ppm suggests a multiplet arising from a multinuclear species while the species at −18.7 ppm seems to be a singlet. A hydride shift like the one for the species at −26.2 ppm is known for example for the formation of multi-hydride clusters.[40] The second species at −18.8 ppm suggests an electron rich rhodium center. Chemical shifts in that region are known for bridging or on plane hydrogens, but also hint towards the binding of a strong donor like e.g. triethylamine. It was possible to confirm the same hydride species in much lower concentrations also in a sample resembling the real reaction mixture using in situ NMR under reaction conditions (supporting information S 2.5). In comparison to triethylamine, the same catalyst solution using diisopropylethylamine was investigated in 1H NMR (Fig. 9 ). While diisopropylethylamine shows about the same basicity as triethylamine, there is a vast difference in steric hindrance as can be seen in Fig. 4. If the amine acts solely as a counter ion, this exchange should have no significant influence. While in general, with diisopropylethylamine the same two hydride species as observed previously with triethylamine (Fig. 8) are formed, the equilibrium between them seems to be severely influenced. While at temperatures < 70 °C the species at −18.7 ppm is predominant, at temperatures > 70 °C the concentration of the species at −18.7 ppm drastically decreases and the second species at −26.2 ppm is formed. Additionally a third species is observed in low concentration at −12.5 ppm for temperatures >70 °C. Assuming the species at −18.7 ppm plays a vital role for the reaction, this might explain the vast differences in reactivity between the two amines. The observations suggest that the amine plays a vital role in the formation of the catalytically active hydride species which goes beyond the sole purpose of a counter ion. The formation of a Rh-N bond as depicted in formula (1) would be a likely explanation. Complementary to NMR spectroscopy, in situ–FTIR-spectra were measured. Using a 10 mL autoclave reactor with a continuous sample loop connected to an FTIR-spectrometer, it was possible to investigate the catalyst formation under reaction conditions. Pure acetonitrile was measured as background spectrum. Afterwards [Rh(acac)(CO)2], CO/H2 and trimethylamine were added stepwise. IR-spectra have been measured every two minutes. Fig. 10 shows a cutout of the carbonyl region between a wavenumber of 1500–2200 cm−1 of representative spectra (full spectra S 2.6). The initial spectrum of [Rh(acac)(CO)2] (Fig. 10 a) shows good accordance with literature.[41,42] The two sharp signals at 2013 cm−1 and 2085 cm−1 can be attributed to stretching vibrations of the carbonyl ligand while the signals at 1530 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1 can be assigned to vibrations of the acetylacetonato ligand. Upon addition of synthesis gas (Fig. 10 b), a slight distortion of the carbonyl peaks at 2015 cm−1 and 2085 cm−1 is observed together with a decrease in the intensity of the acetylacetonato vibrations at 1530 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1, indicating slow substitution of the acetylacetonato ligand. Within few minutes after the addition of triethylamine (Fig. 10 c), the carbonyl signals at 2013 cm−1 and 2085 cm−1 disappear and two broad signals at 1904 cm−1 and 1944 cm−1 as well as a small broad signal at 1817 cm−1 emerge. Moreover, the two signals at 1530 cm−1 and 1570 cm−1 attributed to the acetylacetonato ligand disappear, hinting towards a complete dissociation from the complex. The changes in the IR-spectra indicate the transformation of the catalytic complex into one or more new species. The shift of the carbonyl signals to lower wavenumbers cannot be explained by the formation of uncharged mono- or multinuclear carbonyl complexes, which show carbonyl adsorptions at wavenumbers > 2000 cm−1.[43,44] The shift to lower wavenumbers fits with the formation of anionic rhodium-carbonyl complexes. The signal at 1904 cm−1 can be identified as the previously described [Rh(CO)4]− species.[39] The second signal at 1944 cm−1 and the smaller broad peak at 1817 cm−1 fit very well with the IR-spectra reported in literature for the anionic [Rh4(CO)11]2− cluster.[45] With increasing reaction time [Rh(CO)4]− seems to become more and more the predominant rhodium species in solution (supporting information S 2.7)."
7,Conclusion,"The reductive hydroformylation of 1-octene with rhodium in combination with tertiary amine ligands was investigated. The focus was to understand the role of the amine within this reaction system. The most important parameters for hydrogenation activity are the amine concentration and the carbon monoxide partial pressure. With the help of a Tolman-like map, the influence of steric and electronic characteristics of tertiary amines was investigated. The nature of the amine is crucial for the hydrogenation activity. Only ligands with a pK a of around 8.5–11.5 and a cone angle between 135 and 155° show notable activity in the hydrogenation step. With the insights gained during the investigations, in the end a highly active, selective and robust catalytic system was developed Spectroscopic analysis helped to investigate the influence of the amine on the catalyst. 13C NMR revealed the presence of several anionic rhodium species ([Rh7(CO)16]3−, [Rh4(CO)11]2−, [Rh6(CO)15]2− and [Rh(CO)4]−. The amines act as counter ions for the anionic species but furthermore play a vital role for the formation of rhodium hydride species as was revealed by in situ high pressure 1H NMR. Two important hydride species have been detected at −18.7 ppm and −26.2 ppm. Depending on the amine, the equilibrium between those species is heavily influenced. The presence of anionic rhodium species, especially [Rh(CO)4]− in high concentrations was confirmed by in situ IR-spectroscopy."
