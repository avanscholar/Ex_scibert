0,Introduction,"World population growth over the last decades has increased the global energy demand and, consequently, gave rise to an accelerated search for alternative energy sources. Besides that, environmental and economic concerns would raise awareness on renewable fuels, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and simultaneously providing alternative sources of energy and less dependence of fossil fuels. The high concentration of pollutants and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing extinction of animal species, melting of the polar ice caps and changes in weather patterns (Gutiérrez-Antonio et al., 2017). In the United States, the transportation sector is responsible for most of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as a result of the combustion of petroleum-based products, such as gasoline (EPA, 2017). The development of bioproducts is an option to address these issues. Among the alternative products proposed, biodiesel is considered as one of the most promising alternative fuel sources (Al-Zuhair, 2007; Faried et al., 2017). Biodiesel is defined as mono-alkyl esters derived from the transesterification or esterification reaction of vegetable oils or animal fats fatty acids. Methanol is the most commonly used alcohol for the synthesis of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) because of its low cost and high reactivity. Several studies about the transesterification of vegetable oils (soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, etc.) and animal fats have been performed using methanol (Karmakar et al., 2010; Dai et al., 2015; Granjo et al., 2017; Machado et al., 2018; Kleinberg et al., 2019; Elkelawy et al., 2019). Extensive information is available on transesterification reactions, the production technology, process optimization and assessment of physicochemical properties of FAME (Karmakar et al., 2010; Maia et al., 2015; Granjo et al., 2017; Silitonga et al., 2020). Recently, non-edible vegetable oils have been studied to reduce the dependency on edible oils for biodiesel production (Dharma et al., 2016; Kusumo et al., 2017; Damanik et al., 2017; Ong et al., 2019; Silitonga et al., 2020). More recently, “green diesel” processes, through hydro-processing of vegetable oils, fatty acids and fatty acid esters (employing various reactions such as hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation) have been reported (Snare et al., 2006; de Sousa et al., 2016; Orozco et al., 2017; Srifa et al., 2018; Hongloi et al., 2019). Also, isomerization reactions are made in order to improve the cold behavior of the products (Plavenko and Kharina, 2018). The hydro-processing products are hydrocarbons, generally paraffin and/or isoparaffin chemically identical to those in fossil diesel, and in addition sulfur and aromatic free, high calorific value, low specific gravity, good cold flow properties, excellent storage stability and totally compatible for blending with conventional fuel (Kalnes et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2018). The main competitive advantage of hydro-processing vegetable oils, fatty acids and fatty acid esters is that it is a common commercial technology (UOP Ecofining™ process, 2017; Neste Oil, 2017), and due to the fact that it is a flexible process in terms of feedstock, it can be included in biodiesel production processes (Glisic et al., 2016; Snare et al., 2007). Although the use of hydrogen is considered a determining factor in production costs (Hsu et al., 2018; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2019), the option of incorporating a hydro-processing unit into an existing petroleum refinery, where hydrogenation support infrastructure is available is cheaper than building a stand-alone hydrogenation unit (Glisic et al., 2016). Since the amount of hydrogen required for green diesel production can come from various sources such as existing oil refineries (Kalnes et al., 2007), the future widespread use of these biofuels (biodiesel and green diesel) will depend of the development of new diversified process technologies that may be integrated with the existing technologies and industries. Nowadays, single biofuel manufacturing plants are much less competitive if compared to conventional petroleum refineries. A way to overcome this issue is by moving toward a biorefinery configuration, with the possibility of obtaining a set of different products and thus reducing production costs (Granjo et al., 2017; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2013). The Bioenergy Task 24 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that “biorefinery is the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and energy”, meaning that biorefinery can be a facility, a process, a plant, or even a cluster of facilities (de Jong and Jungmeier, 2015). Among the potential biomass feedstocks for biofuel production there is Babassu (Orbignya ssp.), a South America native palm tree, occurring in forests (ca. 180,000km2), offering renewable resources with immense energy potential that occupy large areas of land in Northern Brazil and Colombia (Carrazza et al., 2012; Porro and Porro, 2015). Besides this, it may also be used as biobased raw feedstock for chemical products. In addition to its agroforestry attributes, the babassu harvest has significant ecological and social importance, as its exploitation contributes to the generation of income to numerous families in the region and thus containing the rural exodus. In addition, babassu plays a key role in maintaining soil fertility and biodiversity favorable to reforestation of dry and nutrient-poor lands, ensuring environmental improvements (Barros, 2011; Campos et al., 2018; Souza et al., 2018). From its seeds, a clear, light yellow vegetable oil may be extracted. Babassu oil is rich in short-chain saturated fatty acids (Supplementary material, Table S1), such as capric, caprylic and lauric acids, being the latter (C12H24O2) the most abundant (40–55% wt.) (Reipert et al., 2011; Paiva et al., 2013; de Oliveira et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2016). Therefore, babassu oil may be an important raw material for the production of biofuels. This study evaluates, from a biorefinery-based perspective, an integrated production of different fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE), using babassu oil and C1–C8 alcohols, into a typical biodiesel plant configuration. For this purpose, babassu fatty acids were obtained from hydrolysis reactions and esterified with the alcohols in order to obtain methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, isoamyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters. Physicochemical properties (kinematic viscosity, density, higher heating value, pour point, cloud point and crystallization temperature) were evaluated and compared to the properties of biodiesel and green diesel reported in other studies. Finally, a multi-purpose flexible industrial configuration is proposed to be able to obtain both biodiesel and/or novel esters from babassu oil as feedstock."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Commercial babassu oil produced by Novo Nilo (Brazil) was used. Analytical-grade methanol (>99.8% wt.), ethanol (>99.8% wt.) and isopropyl alcohol (>99.5% wt.) were supplied by Synth (Brazil). Potassium hydroxide (>85% wt.), sulfuric acid (95–99% wt.), p-toluenesulfonic acid (98.5% wt.) and isobutyl alcohol (>99% wt.) were supplied by Vetec Química (Brazil). Propyl alcohol (>99% wt.) and isoamyl alcohol (>98% wt.) were purchased from Acros Organics (Belgium). 2-ethylhexanol (>99.6% wt.) was supplied by Sigma–Aldrich (USA)."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures 2.2.1 Hydrolysis reaction Initially the babassu oil was submitted to an alkaline hydrolysis (saponification) followed by an acid hydrolysis to obtain fatty acids, as schematically shown in Supplementary material (Fig. S1). Babassu oil was reacted with potassium hydroxide (0.3% wt. KOH/Oil), distilled water (0.2% wt. H2O/Oil) and ethanol (1.6% wt. EtOH/Oil) in a stirred flask at 60°C for 60min. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature (25°C), a sulfuric acid solution (20% v/v) was added in small volumes (20mL) until pH 1.0 to ensure a complete release of the fatty acids from their respective alkali salts (soaps). After that, the solid products (K2SO4) were filtered and the remaining liquid mixture was transferred to a separating funnel where it was washed with distilled water (3:1vol.) until 6<pH<7. This process of obtaining fatty acids was modified from Schroeder (2013) and Lima and Fernandes (2014). 2.2.2 Esterification reactions The fatty acids thus obtained were then esterified using different alcohols (methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, isoamyl or 2-ethylhexyl alcohol) in a three-neck round-bottom flask connected to a reflux water cooled condenser. All reagents (fatty acids+alcohol+catalyst) were taken directly to the reactor at a 1:2 molar ratio of fatty acids to alcohol and 10% wt. of the catalyst (p-toluenesulfonic acid, PTSA) and continuously stirred at 90°C for 4.5h. The mixture was then transferred to a separation funnel at room temperature (25°C) and washed with distilled water to remove residual catalyst. A rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) was then used to remove the remaining water and alcohol (1h at 80°C) to finally obtain the desired esters (Colonelli and da Silva, 2014). The conversion of babassu fatty acids into esters (χ fa ) was calculated using Eq. (1). (1) χ f a ( % ) = ( a f a − a e ) a f a × 100 where a fa is the acid number of the fatty acids and ae is the acid number of the esters, measured according to the AOCS method Cd 3d-63 (2017). In this method, ca. 0.5g of the sample was weighed and then 25mL of ethanol, previously neutralized with the same solution used for the titration, were added. A phenolphthalein alcoholic solution was added and titrated with potassium hydroxide solution 0.1N. The acid number values refer to the mass spent of the potassium hydroxide in milligrams for the neutralization of free acids present in one gram of sample. The fatty acids profile was evaluated using a gas chromatograph (Varian 450, USA) with flame ionization detector and helium as carrier gas. A CP-Wax capillary column (length: 60m, inner diameter: 0.25mm, film thickness: 0.25mm) was used in split injection ratio of 1:20 for the measurements, following the conditions reported in de Oliveira et al. (2018)."
4,Physicochemical properties,"2.3 Physicochemical properties Density at 20°C and kinematic viscosity (at 40 and 100°C) were measured using an automated digital viscometer-densimeter Anton Paar SVM 3000-Stabinger (Austria) according to ASTM D7042. The viscosity index was calculated using the kinematic viscosity values at 40 and 100°C, according to the method ASTM D2270. Higher heating value (HHV) was evaluated according to ASTM D4809 using a static jacket oxygen bomb calorimeter model C1 combined with a cooling water supply unit model KV 600 NR, both from IKA (Germany). Pour point, cloud point and crystallization temperatures were measured to assess the cold behavior of the esters samples. The pour point and the cloud point were determined using an automatic apparatus (ISL – CPP 5Gs from Grabner Instruments, Austria) according to ASTM D97 and ASTM D2500, respectively. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was performed to evaluate the crystallization onset temperature using a DSC 1 Star System from Mettler Toledo (USA). Approximately five milligrams of the sample were added to a 40μl sealed crucible under a nitrogen flow of 50mL/min and then cooled from −30 to 20°C at 1°C/min. Flash point was performed according to ASTM D93 based on the Pensky-Martens closed cup method, using a Koehler apparatus (USA). Statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro 9.1® software (Origin Lab Corp., USA) following the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's least significant difference analysis (p <0.05) for three measurements. The results were reported as the mean with standard deviation (±SD)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrolysis and esterification reactions,"3.1 Hydrolysis and esterification reactions The properties of babassu oil and fatty acids obtained after the hydrolysis reactions are presented in Table 1 . The increased acid number for the babassu fatty acids in comparison to the acid number of the original babassu oil indicates that the hydrolysis reactions were successfully performed (Tubino and Aricetti, 2011). The yield of fatty acids was ca. 81.0% wt. The production of fatty acids is corroborated by the reduction is viscosity values, according to de Filippis et al. (1995). The higher flash point of the babassu oil and fatty acids is favorable since it reduces safety hazards when the product is stored. The fatty acids composition of babassu oil is also reported in Table 1, showing mainly saturated fatty acids (especially lauric, myristic and palmitic). The conversion values of fatty acids to esters using different esterifying alcohols (all above 90% wt.) are shown in Table 2 . The conversion of fatty acids decreases with increasing aliphatic chain of the esterifying alcohol up to isobutanol, which is related by an increase in the nonpolar character of the alcohol molecule, as previously reported by Verma et al. (2016). However, for the branched chain alcohols, conversion increases with increasing carbon number (between C3 and C8), since the branching reduces the nonpolar character of the alcohols, facilitating its interaction with the carboxylic acid functional group. It may also be noted the lowest conversion obtained when using isopropanol which may be related to a steric hindrance of the hydroxyl group in this alcohol (Khan and Fatima, 2015)."
7,Physicochemical properties,"3.2 Physicochemical properties The values for density of samples obtained using different alcohols as esterifying agent are shown in Fig. 1 . Based on the ASTM D6751-20, the density value should be between 0.86 and 0.90g/cm3. The density values of all samples fall within the limits of ASTM standard and decrease with increasing carbon number of the alcohol. Only the product obtained when using the C8 alcohol did not follow that trend, probably related to the higher branching effect of the ethyl group in the 2-ethylhexanol molecule (Luna et al., 2019). The viscosity values at 40°C and 100°C increased with the growth of the esterifying alcohol carbon chain, as shown in Fig. 2 . This may be explained by the greater number of van der Waals-type interactions between carbon chains when a higher alcohol is used (Silva et al., 2016). The viscosity index (VI, see Fig. 2) is used to describe the change of viscosity with increasing temperature. The high viscosity index of all samples (>100) is an indication of low variations in viscosity with increasing temperatures. The kinematic viscosities at 40°C of all samples are within a range of 1.90–6.00cSt, which fulfills the biofuel specification (ASTM D6751). The higher heating value is an important parameter when evaluating a fuel potential, indicating how energetic it is based on the heat released during its burning (Malins et al., 2014). The considerable oxygen content in ester mixtures causes a reduction in the values for this property when compared to fossil fuels (Hoekman et al., 2012). Consequently, the carbon chain growth of the obtained ester molecules (after the reactions with various alcohols and considering the constant saturation degree of the raw material) caused a reduction in the oxygen content in relation to the carbon and hydrogen content. Thus, heating values increased, for higher alcohols (from 37.8 for methanol to 40.5MJ/kg for 2-ethylhexanol), as shown in Fig. 3 ."
8,Cold behavior of samples,"3.3 Cold behavior of samples One of the main technical issues related to FAME production and consumption is its inadequate cold flow behavior. Regardless of the nature of the oil used as raw material, all fatty acid methyl esters are vulnerable to operational problems when used in fuel systems exposed to low temperatures (Dunn, 2011; Sierra-Cantor and Guerrero-Fajardo, 2017). According to Bejan et al. (2014), the size and shape of the carbon chain is directly related to the cold properties of a given molecule. For instance, using branched esters improves the cold performance of an esters-based fuel (Knothe, 2005). The pour point is the lower temperature a fuel loses its flow ability. The cloud point, in turn, is the temperature at which the formation of solid crystals is observed. In general, the cloud point occurs at higher temperatures than the pour point (Knothe, 2005; Verma et al., 2016). The crystallization temperature obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates the temperature at which the first regular and well-defined crystalline structures occur (Peyronel and Marangoni, 2014). The experimental values obtained for pour point, cloud point and crystallization temperature (determined via DSC) in this study are shown in Fig. 4 . The values for these properties improved with the growth of the carbon chain of the obtained esters, being more strongly affected when using branched alcohols in the esterification reactions. As observed by Giraldo et al. (2013), the bulkier alcohol structures have important steric effects on the crystallization temperatures. The increasing distance between molecules hinders the molecular packing thus disfavoring the crystallization process. Overall, an expressive temperature drop of ca. −21°C was obtained for the cold behavior properties when using 2-ethylhexanol compared to using methanol as esterifying agent. Improvement of the crystallization temperature in similar ester systems have been reported using other methods, such as winterization (Silva et al., 2014), blending with mineral oil (Santos et al., 2011), chemical additives (Islam et al., 2016) and fractionation by molecular distillation (de Oliveira et al., 2018). A summary of results from those studies are reported in Table 3 . It may be observed that all products obtained through the esterification reactions with branched alcohols in this study show better cold properties than the other methods previously reported."
9,Comparison of the obtained esters and products from other feedstocks,"3.4 Comparison of the obtained esters and products from other feedstocks The products obtained through the esterification of babassu fatty acids with different alcohols were characterized and compared with biofuels produced by transesterification and hydro-processing reactions, as shown in Table 4 . The viscosity of esters produced was higher than the viscosity values found in babassu biodiesel and palm green diesel produced by de Oliveira et al. (2018) and Hsu et al. (2018), respectively. Although the viscosity value for castor oil green diesel produced by Orozco et al. (2017) is within the range found in this study, probably due to the structure of castor oil and that in addition contains hydroxyl groups, which may lead to parallel reactions and production of long chain compounds. On the other hand, a high calorific value makes green diesel more competitive in terms of combustion and engine performance (Aatola et al., 2008). The use of long chain alcohols such as isobutyl, isoamyl and 2-ethylhexanol improved the heating value of their derived esters, which present values close to those found in green diesel. Based on this, it was observed that these esters have better combustion characteristics than traditional biodiesel (FAME). The esters samples obtained have cloud points similar to the range found in green diesel produced by Neste Oil. In addition, the cloud points found in this study show a significant reduction compared to the data found in the green diesel (mixed and pure) by Orozco et al. (2017), due mainly that it is composed 90% of normal paraffin C17 and C18. The long chain alcohols also improved the pour point values of their derived esters, which present lower values when compared with non-edible oils (Kusumo et al., 2017; Ong et al., 2019)."
10,Process flowsheet for industrial production,"3.5 Process flowsheet for industrial production The biodiesel industry consists of hundreds of facilities worldwide producing billions of liters of this biofuel annually (Aransiola et al., 2014; Gebremariam and Marchetti, 2018; Manaf et al., 2019; Padula et al., 2012). An integration of the biodiesel production process to also obtain new co-products shall be an important mechanism of adding value to this industry. Biodiesel is currently mostly produced from the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats with methanol in a presence of alkaline catalyst. Glycerin is a by-product in this process. That reaction is followed by a separation phase system, where crude esters (upper phase) is separated from the crude glycerin (lower phase). The esters (biodiesel) are purified through excess methanol recovery, water washing multi-steps and finally dried. In this study, different esters are obtained from babassu oil, though their saponification using potassium hydroxide in the presence of ethanol, followed by the hydrolysis of the soaps with sulfuric acid. Fatty acids and glycerin are produced from these reactions. The obtained reaction products pass through a separation system in order to obtain fatty acids (upper phase) and a crude glycerin (lower phase). The fatty acids are then esterified with C1–C8 alcohols obtaining different alkyl esters, which are purified through washing steps. In this case the excess of esterifying alcohol is recovered from the water effluent from washing steps. In both processes, the crude glycerin is purified through splitting soaps with strong acids and removing the resultant free fatty acids by gravity decantation. A block diagram of both biodiesel FAME and alkyl ester production process are depicted in Fig. 5 . It may be seen that both processes present similar reaction processes and separation systems. The saponification, hydrolysis and esterification reactions of the biofuel process may be carried out in stirred reactors as well as the transesterification reaction of the biodiesel FAME process. Phase separations for both processes occur by gravity decantation with similar relative density of the involved streams. The water washing and drying systems to purify biodiesel FAME or biofuel esters with different alcohols are similar. The only operation that may not be integrated is the excess alcohol recovery due to physicochemical different properties of the alcohols. For example, the boiling points of methanol and 2-ethylhexanol are 64.7°C and 184.6°C (Supplementary material, Table S2), and their vaporization enthalpies are 34.4kJ/mol and 60.2kJ/mol, respectively, requiring different sizing conditions for the equipment applied to their evaporation and distillation processes. A multi-purpose and flexible industrial system capable of producing both biodiesel and new esters from babassu oil is presented in Fig. 6 . All equipment included in this flowsheet are present in typical current industrial process for traditional biodiesel production: stirred reactors for the transesterification steps, heaters and coolers for thermal transfer, settlers for liquid-liquid separations, washing columns, flash systems for purifying and drying esters. The degree of integration into one operating unit may provide benefits such as reduced operational costs and significant energy savings. A more efficient use of raw materials and the obtaining of a wider variety of products enables, consequently, increased the profit for a biorefinery. It is worth noting that energy efficiency, better use of raw materials, less idle equipment, greater economic profitability are all attributes of sustainability gains and improvement of the socio-environmental impact of a biorefinery."
11,Conclusions,"The products obtained after esterification with C1–C8 alcohols showed relevant changes on physicochemical properties when compared with FAME. Results for pour point, cloud point and crystallization temperature also indicated that cold properties are highly improved when using branched alcohols in the esterification reactions. An expressive temperature drop of 21°C was observed for pour point when 2-ethylhexanol was used instead of methanol in the esterification reaction. A multi-purpose process, consisting on a flexible industrial system capable of producing the different types of esters studied, was designed. The only operation that may not be integrated is the excess alcohol recovery due to physicochemical different properties of the alcohols. However, a high degree of integration with traditional biodiesel industry may provide benefits such as reduced operational costs and increased the profits for a biorefinery to obtain a wider variety of products."
