0,Introduction,"One of the largest social challenges today is the quest for alternative fuels, which would reduce the greenhouse gas emission as well as the heavy dependence on the depleting fossil fuels [1]. Ethanol is one potential alternative synthetic fuel for use in automobiles, and the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive is already in practice both in the U.S. and internationally. Compared to gasoline constituents, such as trimethylpentane, ethanol produces less CO2 per mile travelled although it does have a lower power density. Moreover renewable ethanol can also serve as a feedstock for the synthesis of variety of industrial chemicals and polymers [2]. Rhodium has been shown to be active for ethanol synthesis from syngas (CO, H2 mixture gas) [3–7]. It has been suggested that Rhodium’s unique activity for oxygenates products stems from its intermediate position in the periodic table between metals which do not dissociate CO (Ir, Pd, Pt) and thus favor methanol production and those which easily dissociate CO under reaction conditions (Co, Fe) and therefore favor production of higher hydrocarbons [8–10]. However, using unpromoted Rh, previous CO hydrogenation studies have observed strong selectivity to methane with minimal selectivity to oxygenates [3,4,6,11]. It is well known that the addition of promoters, such as K, Ti, V and Mn will greatly improve the catalytic performance of Rh catalysts resulting in moderate (i.e. ∼10%) selectivities for specific oxygenates such as ethanol [11–15]. Kinetic studies by Gao et al. [16] have attempted to unravel the role of the promoter. However, even basic questions remain unanswered such as: what is the phase of the promoter? What is its physical relationship to the active metal site? Are unique active sites created at the metal–promoter interface? Here we focus on one such promoter, Mn, to attempt to identify the active phase in the promoter as well as to establish a relationship between reactivity (activity and selectivity) and promoter–metal interaction. In previous studies, it was shown that the stronger metal–promoter interactions can enhance the selectivity to desired products [11,17–23]. In this work, we explore a simple way to enhance the metal–promoter interactions by increasing the Mn promoter loading, so that more Rh particles have access to the Mn promoter. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are chosen as the catalyst support in this work as many previous studies which used CNT supports, have shown exceptional catalytic performance [24–29]. CNTs typically have high surface area (200–300m2/g) [30,31], good mechanical and electronic properties as well as high thermal stabilities [32]. Most importantly for our current study, carbon has a much lower Z number (Z =12) than other supports such as SiO2 and TiO2, so the direct visualization of the Mn promoter and its interactions with Rh particles can be achieved using atomic resolution STEM imaging. The catalysts were tested in a plug flow reactor to determine the catalytic performance, i.e. the rate and product selectivity. In addition, STEM and EELS characterization were employed to quantify the degree of metal–promoter interaction, the particle size distributions, the oxidation state of Rh and Mn, and the phase of Mn. XANES and EXAFS measurements are used to confirm these results and demonstrate the enhanced selectivity to ethanol with increasing metal–promoter interactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts synthesis,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were purchased from Cheap Tube Inc. (O.D. 10–20nm, length 10–30μm, pore volume=4ml/g). Raw CNTs were refluxed in concentrated HNO3, 70vol%, for 10h at 120°C in a heating mantle while stirring. Then the mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water 8 times, followed by drying at 80°C for 8h. The supported Rh2O3 on CNTs was synthesized via Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI) using rhodium nitrate, Rh(NO3)3 (Sigma–Aldrich, 10% Rh in >5wt% HNO3). The precursor was dissolved in deionized water and then added drop wise to impregnate the support. The weight loading of Rh is controlled at 3wt% (0.36at.%). The catalyst was dried in air at room temperature for 24h followed by calcination at 280°C for 4h (5°C /min ramp) to convert the rhodium nitrate into rhodium oxide, Rh2O3. The addition of Mn promoter was sequentially performed also by IWI using manganese nitrate (Sigma–Aldrich, Mn(NO3)2), onto the 3 wt%RhCNTs (pore volume=1.5ml/g) which was synthesized in the first step. The loading of Mn is controlled as 1wt% (0.22at.%) and 2wt% (0.44at.%) respectively in order to vary the degree of metal–promoter interactions. In the end, a final calcination was performed at 250°C for 4h."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging was performed on pre-reduced catalysts (all the catalysts were reduced in flowing H2 at 300°C for 2h before microscopy work) using an aberration-corrected, cold-field emission gun microscope, JEOL JEM-ARM200CF, equipped with a post-column electron energy-loss (EEL) spectrometer, and operated at a primary energy of 200keV. For high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), a maximum spatial resolution of better than 70pm can be achieved, while an energy resolution of 350meV is possible for EEL spectroscopy. The probe size for HAADF imaging is 0.078nm using a 30μm aperture (i.e. a convergence semi-angle of 22mrad) and 0.1nm for EELS mapping using a 40μm aperture. The Gatan Enfina EELS spectrometer is calibrated to ensure that the spectrometer dispersion plane is parallel to the long axis of the CCD detector and properly focused on the detector plane. In addition, the quadrupole and hexapole magnetic lenses in the spectrometer are used to minimize the spectrometer aberrations, in particular for electrons entering the dispersion magnet at large angle with respect to the optical axis. The energy scale is calibrated using the focused zero-loss peak. The pixel dwell time for the EELS mapping is 0.2s/pixel. The samples were prepared for microscopy by grinding a small amount of the reduced catalysts (∼0.01g) and then loading the ground sample (by the electrostatic force) onto a holey carbon copper grid. In this work, HAADF images were used to determine the particle size distribution. The particle sizes were analyzed using the software Comptage de particule (V2). Roughly 500 particles from each sample were randomly chosen and counted for the particle size distribution plots. The elemental composition of the catalysts particles is determined using EELS spectrum imaging combined with mass contrast signals. CO chemisorption measurements were performed at the Catalyst Testing Lab at Northwestern University using an Altamira Instruments BenchCAT 1000HP. Catalysts (0.2–0.3g) were loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor tube, which was weighed before and after sample addition to ensure an accurate weight measurement. This tube was then loaded into the furnace. Each catalyst was reduced at 300°C for 2h (10°C/min ramp rate) and then flushed for 30min in He. 5%CO/He was then pulsed (595μl loop volume) into the system 15–20 times at 30°C to ensure the surface was saturated. Each spectrum was integrated to find the volume of CO remaining following adsorption. Surface saturation was typically reached within 10 pulses. Transmission X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) of the Rh K-edge and Mn K-edge of the in situ reduced MnRhCNTs catalysts were measured at Argonne National Laboratory’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) on the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team’s (MRCAT) bending magnet beamline in sector 10-BM. Catalysts samples were pressed into an in situ cell and reduced at 300°C in H2. After cooling to room temperature, the sample chamber was filled and sealed with He prior to measurements. The data fitting was done with the WinXAS software, version 3.0. A Rh foil was used as a reference for both XANES and EXAFS fitting (N Rh – Rh =12, R =2.69Å), and Mn metal, MnO, Mn2O3 and MnO2 were measured as Mn standards for XANES in order to derive the Mn promoter phase."
4,CO hydrogenation,"2.3 CO hydrogenation The CO hydrogenation performance of the Mn/Rh/CNTs catalysts was investigated under isothermal plug flow conditions by diluting 0.1g of the catalyst with 0.3g SiC (70mesh) in a half-inch diameter stainless steel reactor. Catalysts were reduced prior to reaction for 1h at 300°C in H2 (∼15% H2 balanced in Ar). Reactions were performed at 20bar, 290°C and a syngas flow ranging from 15ml/min to 110ml/min in order to compare the catalytic performance of all the catalysts at different CO conversions. The syngas feed has a composition of 32% CO, 64% H2 (a 1:2 CO:H2 ratio) and 4% N2 as an internal standard. The catalyst bed temperature was monitored by a thermocouple inserted within the catalyst bed. The reaction results reported here were generally obtained after 6h on-stream reaction. Catalyst activities and selectivities were stable over an additional 6h of data collection. A HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with one flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was integrated downstream of the reactor to analyze the reaction products. A 30m by 0.32mm ID HP-Wax bonded polyethylene glycol capillary column (made by Restek) was used for the analysis of the organic products (i.e. ethanol, acetaldehyde, propanol, acetic acid, etc.) via FID. Light inorganic gases (H2, CO, CO2, N2, etc.) and methane as well as light hydrocarbons were separated on packed columns and quantified with TCD."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization A series of Mn-promoted and Mn-unpromoted Rh/CNTs catalysts were synthesized via the IWI synthesis method. The particle size distributions of the catalysts were obtained from STEM imaging (Fig. 1 ), showing that the Rh particles are on average a little over 1nm in size. The Rh K edge EXAFS spectrum of each sample was also obtained in order to estimate the particle size. The Fourier transformation in R space of the data taken on a 2%Mn promoted 3%Rh/CNTs as well as a Rh foil are shown in Fig. 2 . The other catalysts (3%Rh/CNTs and 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs) gave almost identical spectra as the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs, so for simplicity those data are not shown here. From the EXAFS spectra, all the catalysts have large central peak at ∼2.5Å with a smaller shoulder at ∼1.8Å indicating that the particles are metallic with no formation of bimetallic RhMn nano-particles in contrast to the results of Mei et al. [33], in which the authors proposed an alloy nanoparticle model wherein the promoter atom Mn existed in a binary alloy with Rh on the Mn-promoted Rh/SiO2 catalysts. Mei et al. used a co-precipitation technique to synthesize their catalysts followed by calcination at 400°C and reduction at 260°C so the synthesis technique by which the promoter is added could have a significant effect on the nature of the promoter and the subsequent catalytic behavior. By fitting the spectra with the Rh foil standard, the coordination number and bonding distance can be extracted. Finally CO chemisorption was used as a probe of the available surface area for CO hydrogenation based on an assumption of a 1:1 CO:Rh surface site stoichiometry [34,35]. Previous experiments from Yates and Sinfelt has revealed that the stoichiometry changes with particle size but in this work all samples had similar particle sizes based on TEM and EXAFS so the stoichiometry was assumed to be the same for all samples. For all 3 samples the CO chemisorption data indicated very similar available surface areas (54–58%). This indicates that the presence of Mn does not reduce the available surface area for adsorption of CO and no site blocking occurs. The particle sizes by EXAFS and STEM and the dispersions indicated by CO chemisorption for promoted and unpromoted catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . Both the EXAFS and STEM indicated that the average Rh particle size of the three catalysts is about 1nm while the CO chemisorption indicated slightly less dispersion than expected for the particle sizes (which would indicate ∼80% dispersion) found via either EXAFS or STEM. As shown in Fig. 3 , XANES measurements after in situ reduction at 300°C are characteristic of metallic Rh for 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs. Using Rh foil and Rh2O3 as standard references, the XANES result from 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs matches the Rh metallic feature, in a similar fashion to the EXAFS spectra. Therefore, we can conclude that all the Rh particles after reduction would all exhibit Rh metallic phase in regardless of the amount of Mn loading. Previously [17], we found that Mn could shift the reduction temperature of Rh depending upon the method of Mn promotion. However, the reduction temperature of 300°C is sufficient to fully reduce the Rh in this case. Although promoted Rh catalysts have been intensively studied previously for ethanol synthesis, the phase and location of the promoter to the metallic Rh nano-particles are not thoroughly understood. XANES can be used to investigate the metal oxidation state and to help identify the promoter phase [36–39]. For example, Bayram et al. [39] have investigated the transformation of cobalt coordination environment during ethanol steam reforming by comparing the XANES spectra of Co species under reaction condition with the XANES spectra of Co standards (Co, CoO, Co3O4), to determine Co phase at various reaction temperatures. Following this example, we first examined the XANES of various Mn standards (Mn, MnO, Mn2O3, MnO2) as shown in Fig. 4 . The Mn standards exhibit distinct features in the primary XANES peak between 6.55 and 6.57keV that allows for straightforward discrimination between phases. Besides the major peak differences, the pre-edge of each spectra is another important feature to distinguish the Mn standards from each other. For example, the Mn metal has a pre-edge at ∼6.539keV, and MnO, MnSO4, Mn(II) acetylacetonate, and MnO2 have pre-edges energies of 6.5405, 6.5405, 6.5406, and 6.5430 respectively. The Mn2O3 sample has an extended shoulder right after its pre-edge peak and this feature is not observed with the MnO spectra. In Fig. 5 , the Mn K edge XANES spectra of 1%Mn3%RhCNTs and 2%Mn3%RhCNTs were plotted together with the MnO reference; both of the Mn-promoted catalysts have the same pre-edge energy as the MnO reference at 6.5405keV, without an additional shoulder peak right after pre-edge peak. Moreover, both of the catalysts also exhibited similar XANES major peak as the MnO reference. Consequently, the promoter phase (oxidation state) is confirmed here as Mn(II). The assignment of the promoter as MnO has been previously made by, Wilson et al. [40] for Mn/Rh/SiO2 catalysts, Morales et al. [41,42] for Mn/Co/TiO2 catalysts and Bezemer et al. [21] for Mn/Co/CNF catalysts. Although the promoter phase has been identified as MnO regardless of loading, it is also necessary to determine the physical relationship between Rh and MnO and to determine how the local structure influences catalyst performance. STEM–EELS mapping has previously been used to successfully analyze the distribution of the promoter phase on the catalyst surface [43]. Figs. 6 and 7 show the high-resolution imaging and elemental composition of the two Mn-promoted catalysts (2%Mn3%RhCNTs and 1%Mn3%RhCNTs). The Mn L-edge energy loss signal is used to map the Mn distribution, and mass contrast imaging was used for the Rh signal, since the Rh K-edge signal is not sufficient for EELS spectrum image analysis. By combining the STEM–EELS results from Figs. 6 and 7, it is obvious that on multiple different areas of both catalysts, Rh particles were found to be associated with a thin layer of MnO. However, the degree of Mn–Rh (promoter–metal) interaction is different for these two Mn loadings. On the 2%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst, MnO was found to have a higher degree of association with Rh particles than that on the 1%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst. For instance, in Fig. 6, it is common for the 1%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst that a layer of MnO were only in contact with 1–2 Rh particles, but in Fig. 7, it is common for the 2%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst that a layer of MnO were normally in contact with 3–4 Rh particles. In addition to EELS mapping, additional EELS spectra were taken when the electron beam, which has a probe size of 1Å in diameter, was placed directly on or at the edge of the catalyst particles. In this way, one can directly tell if there is Mn associated with the analyzed Rh particles in the corresponding EELS spectrum. We analyzed ∼150 particles and their vicinities for each catalyst to attempt to quantify the degree of metal–promoter interactions in the two promoted catalysts. For the 2%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst, there are ∼55% Rh particles are in contact with MnO, while for the 1%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst, there are ∼30% Rh particles are in contact with MnO. These results indicate that the higher the Mn loading, the higher the degree of metal–promoter interactions. EELS can also be used to confirm the oxidation state of the Mn promoter by looking at the Mn L edge energy loss spectrum. As shown in Fig. 8 , the Mn L 3-edge main peak was centered at 645eV and the Mn L 2-edge main peak was centered at 657eV, so the interval in between L 3 main peak and L 2 main peak is 12eV. Laffont et al. [44] have used high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy to study the intrinsic properties of various Mn oxides (MnO, Mn2O3, MnO, MnO2 and Mn3O4). In their results, the L 3 and L 2 edge peak difference for MnO is 12eV as well (641.2eV for L 3 main peak and 653.2eV for L 2 main peak). The peak onset energy of the L 3 and L 2 peaks is shifted in our spectra. These chemical shift phenomena might be caused by charge transfer between MnO and metallic Rh or even by the charge transfer in between the MnO and the CNTs support. Sun et al. also found this kind of chemical shift in their EELS of Pd–Cu/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts EELS study [45]. However, the L 3, L 2 peak difference is a fixed value and will not be affected by the shift, allowing us to confirm the presence of MnO (as opposed to Mn2O3 or MnO2 for which the peak differences are 11 and 10eV, respectively). Consequently, we can conclude the Mn(II) oxide promoter phase from the EELS analysis is in agreement with the XANES spectra (see Fig. 4)."
7,CO hydrogenation reactivity,"3.2 CO hydrogenation reactivity The CO hydrogenation reactivity results are summarized in Table 2 . At ∼3% CO conversion, the major products produced by the unpromoted Rh/CNTs catalyst are 10% ethanol, 51% methanol and 32% methane, small amount of light C2+ hydrocarbons (5%) and acetaldehyde (2%) are also detected in the total products. Previously, in our examination of Rh catalysts supported on silica (3wt% Rh, the average particle size is ∼2.7nm, reaction condition at 285°C, 20bar and 2:1 H2:CO ratio, 4% CO conversion) [17], we found that the selectivity to methane was 30% with higher hydrocarbons as the only other products, so the production of oxygenates by the unpromoted catalysts has been significantly improved by the presence of the CNT support. From Table 2, it is also observed that with the increase in the CO conversion, the TOF of the Mn/3%Rh/CNTs remains nearly constant within some experimental error. The 2%Mn/3%Rh/CNTs decrease. This could indicate that a mass transfer limitation exists at the higher Mn loading, but it seems likely that the decrease in the TOF is due to a combination of random error in the measurement (which can be seen for the 1%Mn/3%Rh/CNT catalyst) and the fact that the rate is an integral rate as the conversion increases (i.e. the concentration of CO decreases). These results here are similar to that of Egbebi et al. [15] in their study of 1wt%Rh/TiO2 catalyst (the average size is ∼1nm) for CO hydrogenation at 270°C, 20bar and 2:1 H2:CO ratio in which they found the products contained 62% methane, 10% ethanol, 5.5% methanol, 9.2% acetaldehyde and the rest ∼10% contained CO2 and C2+ light hydrocarbons at 1% conversion of CO. Just as the TiO2 support acts as a promoter, it appears to be the case for the CNT support as well, as the amount of ethanol produced from unpromoted catalysts is identical, while the selectivity to methane in our study is half that reported by Egbebi for Rh/TiO2. The ability to produce oxygenates from TiO2 supported Rh catalysts has been attributed to SMSI effects [46–48], where supports have strong interactions with active metal and act as a promoter. It seems here the support has an even better promoting effect than TiO2 catalyst, but the mechanism of promotion must be different here since the CNTs cannot be reduced to a suboxide which then covers the metal nanoparticles as has previously been observed with Rh/TiO2 [47]. Previous theoretical calculations [49,50] have suggested that the CNT support may influence the electronic structure of the metal nanoparticle, but the XANES does not offer any evidence to this effect. For the two Mn-promoted catalysts, the TOF of the two samples is similar to one another, but the TOFs are increased by an order of magnitude as compared to the unpromoted catalyst, which could be due to a lowering of the activation barrier. Moreover the increase in the TOF could also be associated with the presence of new sites that are created by the promoter/metal interface. Using CO chemisorption as a probe of available surface for reaction, we observe that CO can at least adsorb on approximately the same number of metallic sites regardless of the promoter’s presence. As discussed above, the STEM–EELS measurements have demonstrated that the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst has a better Rh–Mn metal promoter interaction than the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst. The degree of metal–promoter interactions was found to be an important factor for the productivity of desired products in our previous studies [17]. Increasing the degree of the promoter–metal interaction results in a higher selectivity toward the desired products (i.e. ethanol). If this trend holds, the 2%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst should have enhanced ethanol productivity compared with the 1%Mn3%RhCNTs catalyst due to its better metal–promoter interaction. As reported in Table 2, the selectivity toward ethanol is higher at all conversions. Furthermore, Table 2 indicates that the selectivity to ethanol decreases as the CO conversion increases. The origin of this decrease in selectivity stems from the production of a significant amount of CO2. This result is anticipated because at a syngas ratio (H2:CO) of 2, an increase in ethanol production will result in a simultaneous production of water which serves as a source for the water gas shift reaction. Water gas shift has also been observed in our previous CO hydrogenation study on MnRh/SiO2 catalyst at high CO conversion (above 40%) [17]. Excluding CO2 production, the selectivity to ethanol is actually seen to increase slightly as conversion increases as shown in Fig. 9 with the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst always producing more ethanol (∼10% higher selectivity) than the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst. The improvement in the ethanol selectivity for the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst here further demonstrates that more intimate interaction of the Mn promoter with Rh increases the alcohol selectivity. This is consistent with the previous proposal that the active sites for the CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols reaction are located at the interface of the active metal and the promoter [13]. The ethanol selectivity enhanced by better Rh–Mn interactions of this work is consequently in agreement with our previous results [17]. The work of Mei et al. provides another interesting contrast. In their Mn/Rh/SiO2 catalyst, the Mn and Rh are alloyed as opposed to Mn existing in an oxidized state. In their results, the catalyst produces similar amounts of CH4 at the same temperature and conversion but produces significantly more C2 oxygenates (other than ethanol) while producing no CO2. Accompanying DFT calculations show that the presence of Mn dramatically lowers the barrier for CH+CO to produce CHCO and increases CO insertion rates at the expense of hydrogenation events. Mei et al. also report very high barriers (>1.6eV) for CO2 formation from oxidation of CO with either O or OH, but this does not appear to be strongly affected by the presence of Mn so the suppression of water gas shift remains unclear . As ethanol selectively increases, the acetaldehyde selectivity decreases (e.g. acetaldehyde produced by 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs decreased from 6.5% to 2.4% when the CO conversion increased from 4% to 14%), suggesting that the acetaldehyde has not been fully hydrogenated to ethanol and acetaldehyde is likely an intermediate product. If we take the ratio of ethanol/acetaldehyde for the two promoted catalysts at various CO conversions, there is always a higher ethanol/acetaldehyde ratio observed for the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst (e.g. at CO conversion ∼4%, the ethanol/acetaldehyde ratio for 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs is ∼5.4, while for 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs is ∼4), suggesting that better Rh–Mn interactions promote the hydrogenation rate to give more ethanol. This result is slightly surprising given that the role of the promoter is typically regarded as facilitating C–O bond cleavage and C–C bond formation as opposed to C–H bond formation as suggested by theoretical studies for CO hydrogenation by Rh-based catalysts [33,51,52]. For example, in Zhao et al.’s [51] density functional theory calculations, the authors find that the Rh-decorated Cu alloy catalyst has a significantly lower CO insertion barrier compared to pristine Rh(111) and Rh(553) surfaces, whereas the variation of CH x (x =1, 2, 3) hydrogenation barriers on the three surfaces is modest. Similarly, recent calculations of Li et al. [53] examining metallic Mn overlayers about Rh surfaces, suggesting that the role of Mn is to lower the CO dissociation barrier as well as provide a lower barrier for CO insertion with the most favorable pathway occurring through formation of CH3CO. In addition, the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst produced no acetic acid nor C3+ oxygenates products, while the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst produced considerable amounts of these products (e.g. ∼22% at 3.6% CO conversion). As shown in Fig. 10 , the total production of oxygenates (excluding CO2) remains relatively constant as CO conversion increases with the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs producing slightly more oxygenates due to the substantial difference in the production of acetic acid and other C3+ oxygenates. Since acetic acid is an unwanted product in alcohol synthesis reaction, suppression of acid production by 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst is considered to be another improvement for alcohol synthesis. However, the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst did produce higher selectivity to methane than the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst. For example, at 4% CO conversion, the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst had a ∼49% selectivity to methane while the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst had a ∼38% selectivity to methane. In the CO hydrogenation by Mn-promoted Rh/CNTs catalyst by Pan et al. [25], the authors also observed that the methane selectivity was increased when the catalyst has a higher ethanol selectivity, specifically at 320°C and 30bar pressure (2:1 H2:CO syngas ratio), the RhMn-in-CNTs catalyst (Mn-promoted Rh catalyst deposited inside CNTs) produced ∼25% ethanol and ∼46% methane at a CO conversion of 18.8%, while the RhMn-out-CNTs catalyst (Mn-promoted Rh catalyst deposited outside the CNTs) produced ∼18% ethanol and ∼27% methane at a CO conversion of 1.8%. Pan et al. only compared the selectivity at two different CO conversions, so it is not clear how the change in conversion would affect their selectivity ratio (presumably at higher conversion there is a higher selectivity to non-C1 products) [17]."
8,Conclusion,"In this work, highly dispersed Rh/CNTs catalysts with and without a Mn promoter were synthesized. The average particle size of each catalyst was about 1nm. All catalysts are reduced to metallic Rh with no evidence of bimetallic RhMn nano-particle formation. Both XANES and EELS spectra show that the Mn promoter is present as MnO. EELS mapping showed that the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst has a better metal–promoter interaction than the 1%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst. Catalytic reactivity results show while both of the catalysts produced similar amount of total oxygenates (ethanol, methanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and C3+ oxygenates), the 2%Mn3%Rh/CNTs catalyst gave a higher ethanol selectivity which correlates with the higher degree of Rh–Mn interactions. Therefore, one can conclude that it is critical to create a high degree of interaction between the active metal and promoter to achieve high selectivity to ethanol."
