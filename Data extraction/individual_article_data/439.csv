0,Introduction,"Photocatalyst substances can convert light energy into chemical energy and undergo redox reaction [1–3]. Research using photocatalysts widely varies, from environment to renewable energy sector, with TiO2 being used as a representative photocatalyst. TiO2 receives maximum attention because it is: i) chemically stable, ii) inexpensive, iii) harmless to human body, and iv) displays high catalytic activity [3]. However, despite these advantages, a disadvantage of TiO2 is that its photocatalytic activity can only be generated in the UV region because of its significantly high bandgap energy [4]. Photocatalysts exhibiting activity in the visible light region have recently received much attention because of their high feasibility for photocatalytic decomposition under sunlight, fusion systems for CO2 conversion, and hydrogen production from water [5,6]. Bandgap engineering is a typical method that can increase photocatalytic activity in the visible light region. For example, anions with smaller electronegativity than oxygen are substituted (doped) with it in the photocatalysts [7]. Metal and anion doping are used to decrease and increase the CB and VB energies of TiO2, respectively. Anatase TiO2 has a bandgap of 3.2 eV, whereas TiO2 doped with metal or nitrogen ions has a bandgap of 2.6 eV and 2.5 eV, respectively [8]. This implies that metal and anion doping lower the bandgap energy so that electrons located in the VB can move to CB even in the visible region. The most well-known anions are carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur and well-known metal ion doping materials include Fe, Ag, and Br [9]. However, the effect of Ni metal ion doping has not been studied despite Ni having high utility value because of its high electronegativity. DO is an organic contaminant containing two symmetric and opposite ether bonds which has been widely used as a solvent in the production of textiles, adhesives, lacquers, dyes, varnishes, degreasing agents, and cosmetics. The recent widespread usage of dioxane has significantly increased the risk of soil, surface water, groundwater, and wastewater contamination. Since 1990, dioxane has been classified as a carcinogen and is known to cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes [10]. This paper describes the preparation method of N-Ni-TiO2 as a visible light-sensitive photocatalyst. In this study, physicochemical properties of N-Ni-TiO2 were analyzed and its photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and DO decomposition was evaluated using liquid phase plasma (LPP) from DO aqueous solution."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of N-Ni-TiO2 photocatalyst,"2.1 Preparation of N-Ni-TiO2 photocatalyst N-Ni-TiO2 was synthesized using the sol-gel reaction. In 16.7 M iso-propyl alcohol (Duksan, 98.5%), 0.5 M titanium tetraisopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and 0.5 M diethanolamine (Samjung, 99%) were mixed. Afterwards, this solution was stirred at room temperature for approximately 5 h to undergo reaction for obtaining a TiO2 solution. Subsequently, NiNO3 (Duksan, 99%) was injected into the solution. The amount of NiCO3 injected was adjusted differently in the range of 1–5 wt% of the mass ratio of TiO2 in the solution and was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. Later, 0.05 M NH3CO3 (Ducksan, 98%) was injected in the solution and stirred for 5 h to obtain a N-Ni-TiO2 precursor solution. Afterwards, this solution was dried at 130 °C for one day to obtain N-Ni-TiO2 powder, which was heated at a rate of 3 °C/min and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h to obtain N-Ni-TiO2 powder."
3,Photocatalytic decomposition of DO solution,"2.2 Photocatalytic decomposition of DO solution Photocatalytic reaction was performed in a reactor where LPP was directly irradiated with a liquid reactant, which is an aqueous solution with dissolved DO. The photocatalytic reactor with LPP used in this study was shown in Fig. S1. In this reactor, 150 mL reactant and 0.5 g photocatalyst were injected. During the reaction, gas and liquid products were analyzed using GC, which measured the changes in H2 production and DO concentration. The rate of H2 production as determined by the amount of hydrogen produced per 1 h. The hydrogen production yield was calculated based on the calibration of the area of the GC peak with respect to the amount of pure hydrogen."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The light absorption characteristics of N-Ni-TiO2 were analyzed through UV–visible diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS; Shimatzu, UV-2550) using BaSO4 as a reflectance standard material at 200–800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) was measured using PL spectrometer (Acton Research Co., Spectrograph 500i). A HeCd laser was used for excitation at 325 nm. The binding state of N-Ni-TiO2 constituent elements was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) obtained through an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (VG, MultoLab 2000) in a chamber at a pressure of 10-6–10-7 Pa using Al Kα X-ray. The resolution of N-Ni-TiO2 was measured at 0.35 eV using a silver fermi edge."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of N-Ni-TiO2,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of N-Ni-TiO2 Fig. 1 (a) shows the DRS of N-Ni-TiO2 with different Ni doping amounts. The absorption curve of N-Ni-TiO2 displayed a wider absorption region to visible light compared to TiO2. Moreover, the absorption region was widest at the Ni content of 3 wt%, and when it was increased by ≥5 wt%, the absorption region narrowed. The bandgap can be estimated from square root plot of the Kübelka–Münk function F(R) for photon energy. The plot of F(R)1/2 for photon energy is shown in Fig. S2. The bandgap of N-Ni-TiO2 obtained from the DRS was approximately 2.4 eV. Fig. 1(b) shows PL spectrum of N-Ni(3)-TiO2. The wavelength of peak luminescence is converted as the bandgap using equation E = hc/λ. The bandgap of N-Ni-TiO2 was estimated also ca. 2.4 eV. It is expected that doping nitrogen along with Ni can further enhance the photocatalytic activity. N-Ni-TiO2 under visible-light irradiation since N and Ni can modify the band structure as shown in Fig. S3. Co-doping introduces two different electronic states in the bandgap of TiO2, which decrease bandgap and lifetime of the charge carriers [11]. Fig. 2 shows the XPS results of N-Ni-TiO2. Tip3, Tip1, O1s, and N1s peaks were observed in the XPS. A significantly weak Ni2p peak was also observed. The inset image in Fig. 2 shows the N1s scan and it can be seen that N1s peaked at approximately 398 eV binding energy. The peak for N1s at approximately 400 eV appeared due to chemically adsorbed nitrogen compounds, nitrogen present inside N1s, and nitrogen present in the raw materials used to prepare TiO2. Nitrogen peak was because of nitrogen that was chemically adsorbed on TiO2 structure or present inside it. This type of nitrogen bond is categorized as interstitial type and has been reported to exhibit better photocatalytic activity [12]. Thus, nitrogen doping facilitated the utilization of visible light because of the absorption of 400–600 nm by N-Ni-TiO2."
7,Photocatalysis of DO solution using LPP on N-Ni-TiO2 photocatalyst,"3.2 Photocatalysis of DO solution using LPP on N-Ni-TiO2 photocatalyst Fig. 3 shows the rate of H2 evolution that simultaneously occurred with the degradation of DO during photocatalysis. The DO concentration decreased as the reaction progressed. Fig. 3(a) shows the case when no photocatalyst was injected in the DO aqueous solution having an initial concentration of 20 mg/L. The concentration decreased due to photocatalytic decomposition of DO on TiO2 and N-Ni-TiO2 photocatalysts. DO was observed to degrade faster on N-Ni-TiO2 than TiO2, suggesting higher photocatalytic activity on N-Ni-TiO2 than TiO2. Fig. 3(b) shows the rate of H2 evolution that simultaneously occurred with the photocatalytic decomposition of DO on TiO2 and N-Ni-TiO2 from the DO aqueous solution. Hydrogen was produced due to the decomposition of water and DO even when no photocatalyst was injected. Hydrogen production increased proportionally with LPP irradiation time. When a photocatalyst was injected, the rate of H2 evolution significantly increased. The H2 production rate was higher on N-Ni-TiO2 than TiO2 due to difference between the visible light sensitivity of both. As shown in the DRS results, N-Ni-TiO2 was activated by absorbing not only UV but also visible light in 400–600 nm range. LPP showed strong emission in the UV light of 309 nm and visible light of 486 nm [13]. Furthermore, N-Ni-TiO2 apparently showed photocatalytic activity for light emission in both regions, whereas TiO2 only showed the activity in the UV region. Additionally, DRS results indicated that N-Ni-TiO2 exhibited better photocatalytic activity due to its high photosensitivity extended to visible light."
8,Conclusions,The photocatalytic activity of N-Ni-TiO2 was investigated through the photocatalytic decomposition of DO using LPP. N-Ni-TiO2 prepared using the facile sol-gel method contained a light absorption region extending to visible light compared to TiO2. The bandgap of N-Ni-TiO2 was approximately 2.4 eV. Hydrogen was simultaneously generated with DO decomposition during the photocatalytic decomposition. N-Ni-TiO2 showed better decomposition and H2 production efficiency than TiO2. This was because N-Ni-TiO2 caused photochemical reactions under both UV and visible light by irradiating LPP that emitted strong UV and visible light.
