0,Introduction,"Deinking is a term describing a process for detaching and removing printing inks from recycled fibers to improve optical characteristics of pulp and paper using recovered printed material. It is the most important process stage in processing of recovered paper as a raw material for the production of deinked pulp primarily used for manufacturing different papers [1]. The detachment of the printing ink from the fibers of the disintegrated recycled pulp needs chemical and mechanical conditions. A combination of chemical and mechanical forces is often necessary to remove the ink particles from the fibers. The mechanical force is usually supplied by a pulper where the paper is beaten into its constituent fibers. The ink particles first are detached from the fibers by factors like: hydrodynamic flow of the liquid phase in the pulper, swelling of the fibers, flexing and bending of the fibers, and abrasion of the fibers against each other [2]. The mechanical force in the pulper is not sufficient for effective ink removal, therefore, surface active chemicals (e.g. NaOH, H2O2, chelating agent, etc.) are added in the pulper to decrease adhesion of the printing ink to the fibers and to increase the ink removal efficiency [1–3]. Due to the influence of the chemicals and the mechanical shear forces, ink particles of different sizes are released to the aqueous phase. The brightness of recovered paper is about 40–45% ISO after pulping [1]. Once the ink particles are detached from the fiber by the mechanical action, they are then separated from the fibers via a variety of operations like washing and flotation as shown in Fig. 1 . Wash deinking and flotation deinking are two principal deinking systems adopted by the paper industry. A sequence of these two processes is also possible and in many deinking processes, the mills used various combinations of both systems [1,4]. Flotation, the most common method used, provides a high yield of fibers, i.e. a low amount of rejects, and less effort to purify the white water produced. It is a selective separation method using the different surface properties of particles. Air is introduced into a diluted fiber suspension of 0.8–1.5% consistency. 1 1 Defined as the mass in grams of oven-dry fiber in 100g of pulp–water mixture. The water-repelling ink particles attach to the air bubbles and rise to the surface. The hydrophilic fibers remain in the water phase. The foam that contains the ink particles can be removed mechanically, by overflow. The efficiency of ink separation depends on the ink properties such as ink particle size, ink particle chemistry, the printing process, the printing substrate, aging of printed product, the conditions, and parameters of the deinking processes in terms of the chemical, mechanical, and hydraulic flow regimes such as chemical or collector concentration, water hardness, air bubble diameter, air-to-stock ratio, foam removal system, and paper quality used [5,6]. Many researchers described the factors that affect flotation deinking in their papers [1,2,4,5,7,8]. They recommended optimum values of consistency 0.5–2%, temperature 40–55°C, and water hardness 110–130ppm Ca2+, optimum amounts of deinking chemical sodium hydroxide: 0.25–1.0%, hydrogen peroxide: 0.5–1.0%, soap: 0.25–1.0wt% based on dry newspaper, and pH 8–11. During the process, flotation aids are added such as calcium salts and/or surfactants (collectors) [3]. The requirement for chemicals in a deinking process varies considerably depending on raw materials, the type of ink to be removed, quality specifications of the deinked pulps, and the type of process [1,9]. Different separation process function at different particle size ranges. The washing process is successful when the ink particles are very small. Flotation requires larger particles [1]. It is effective for removal of particles between 10 and 100μm, with the optimum size range about 20–40μm [1,10]. This is the lower limit for particles that are visible to the naked eye. There is a widespread recognition that better results are achieved by a combination system, since wash deinking is less effective in the removal of large ink specks (>20μm), whilst flotation deinking is less effective in removal of small ink particles (<20μm) [5]. Recovered graphic paper contains: printing inks, fibers, fillers, coating pigments, starch, synthetic coating binder, other paper chemicals, adhesives, and plastic films from converted paper, metal, sand, and glass. The basic components of the printing inks are vehicles (15–80% carriers which dissolve the solid binders and keep the ink in the press fluid and 5–50% binders responsible for forming the ink film), 5–30% colorants (practically insoluble, inorganic or organic pigments or soluble organic dyes that have rare use in conventional printing inks), and 1–10% additives which are useful to adapt certain ink characteristics such as drying, gloss, and abrasion resistance. Examples of such additives are drying agents, oils, waxes, plasticizers, lubricants, and dispersing agents, and other components. Table 1 shows typical recipes for black printing ink systems [6]. Due to economic advantages, water-based flexographic inks are used in newspaper printing in many countries like Iran. Saponifiable synthetic dispersions are the binders. Because these dispersions are soluble in an alkaline environment, the conditions of the flotation deinking process are insufficient for satisfactory deinking water-based flexographic printing. In contrast to offset and rotogravure inks, the inks do not have a hydrophobic nature. The particles of the flexographic ink are also very small. This results in impaired flotation efficiency [6]. Only a maximum brightness gain of 8% ISO in flexographic newspaper is attainable by flotation which is a very poor result. Using washing instead of flotation can remove the water-based ink and give the brightness gain about 20% ISO. Washing efficiency is also affected by variables like pH, temperature, and treatment given before the washing stage, usually during pulping. Results were similar for deinking tests for various European newspapers [6]. Flotation can be followed by washing, to increase brightness and to remove filler [1,5]. Flotation cell gives an increase of 12–14 units [5]. The brightness is about 60% ISO after deinking [1]. Bleaching can improve the brightness even more. When ink particles have been detached from the fibers and dispersed into the aqueous phase, a risk exists that they will redeposit on the fiber surfaces if the colloidal stability of the ink particles is not sufficiently high. Three types of redepositions are lumen loading, chemical redeposition (physico-chemical adsorption) onto the fiber surface, and mechanical entrapment into fiber surface irregularities. Among the chemicals used in the pulper such as the surfactants, sodium hydroxide provides a hydrophilic character to the ink particles [1,9]. The effective pulper capacity falls if sodium hydroxide is not used, since caustic aids wastepaper disintegration, probably by faster wetting of interfiber hydrogen bonds [5]. In the pulping stage, pH is high at approximately 9–10, due to adding of sodium hydroxide. Also sodium hydroxide causes swelling of the fibers resulting in easy removal of printing ink. A possible mechanism is that some binders in a printing ink can saponify and hydrolyze at high pH. This could improve the water solubility of the ink. In flotation, fibers are swollen by NaOH, and this action breaks the bond between fibers and print, because the print does not swell, it also increases final brightness. Another belief is that it hydrolyses ester groups in print particle networks, causing the print to break up into small particles [11]. For successful flotation, the ink particles must flocculate to larger agglomerates. The surface properties of the agglomerates also must change, i.e. the hydrophobic character must increase [1]. Chemicals that collect ink into greater particles while simultaneously giving these agglomerates a hydrophobic surface are collectors. Different types of collector chemicals are available. They are fatty acids, semi-synthetic, and synthetic collectors [1]. Soap increases the tendency of print particles to collect at air bubble surfaces, soap is called a “collector”. Prior to adding the collector, the removed ink particles from the fibers are too small with surface properties too hydrophilic to float. Calcium soap addition to a flotation cell creates foam which is deep enough to be separated from the stock by controlled overflow, but it does not grow uncontrollably. It also gives brighter stock. Calcium soap of stearic acid as a fatty acid collector can be added to the pulper or to the flotation unit. Adding in portions is also possible. Very strong opinions exist regarding the optimum dosing point. Both dosing points find frequent use. A need arises to add some surface active compound in the pulper if all soap is added in the flotation step. The main advantage with addition of soap to the flotation operation is better control of the foaming properties in the cells [1]. Hydrogen peroxide, as another chemical used in deinking, is believed to bleach fibers and increase the brightness of stock by reversing the yellowing of mechanical fibers caused by the caustic in pulper. It is effective at stopping the darkening of mechanical fibers caused by sodium hydroxide. It is commonly added to the pulper. It is also suggested that peroxide breaks bonds in print networks, which can help to detach print from fibers, and also create smaller print particles. These smaller particles may float better, which will decrease speckiness. One problem that occurs with the use of peroxide is its decomposition due to microbiological action. Catalase is an enzyme generated by bacteria to protect themselves against peroxide attack. It catalytically destroys peroxide very rapidly. The effect in a deink plant is obviously to reduce brightness sharply. It is difficult to free a system from catalase. Stressing the bacteria by either raising or lowering the temperature sometime works, and adding large amounts of peroxide can also resolve the problem [1,11]."
1,Our approach to deinking based on alcohols,"Alcohols are one of the most common frothers used in mineral flotation. These are used vastly in mineral industry. With increased pressure on all aspects of chemical use, a few mills have operated without any chemicals in their deinking mill [5]. In this paper, the effect of different alcohols was studied instead of hydrogen peroxide in different stages like: pulping, flotation, and combination of them. Alcohols as nonionic surfactants in alcohol deinking can play the role of frother, collector, and solvent of water-based flexographic ink particles simultaneously. Alcohols against hydrogen peroxide have no destructive effect on fibers [12]. Deinking is studied by a combination of an alcohol and soap (dual system), soap free, peroxide free in flotation stage, and totally peroxide free in both pulping and flotation stages. Deinking with alcohol can provide some advantages for a deinking plant. To fulfill these demands, the alcohol must be difficult to dissolve in water and be able to form hydrophobic surfaces, i.e. alcohol with long alkyl chain length. The influence of number of carbons in alkyl chain or chain length, on the froth properties (e.g. froth power) generated by alcohols was reported in [13]. Frother power is defined as volume of froth generated in a standard machine under standard operating conditions. Experimental literature data showed that for straight, branched chain, and cyclic alcohols having a varying number of carbon atoms, frother power increases with the number of carbon atoms up to 6 or 7, and then drops drastically when the alcohol has more than 8 carbon atoms [13]. Therefore, in this work, the effect of number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain (1–7) or chain length on brightness gain and intensity of ink spot is investigated in detail."
2,Experimental methods,"The flotation cell holds an effective volume of 1l, so for a consistency of 1.0%, 10g of dry paper is necessary. Deinking chemicals added to the process are typically specified as a percentage of the amount of dry paper added. Increased temperature alone can have a significant effect on properties. High pulping temperature increase ink and other contaminant dispersion. Laboratory flotation runs led to the conclusion that the flotation cell temperature was optimal between 40 and 45°C [5]."
3,Pulping,"3.1 Pulping Consistency in pulping is important for the chemical dosages since these are calculated on the amount of air-dry paper. A higher stock consistency in a pulper means less water and a higher concentration of chemicals. This gives a higher chemical efficiency [1]. Recovered paper is disintegrated in water at a consistency of 7% (recommended consistency 5–18% depending on the type of pulper used). Ten grams of paper was added to a 14 speed Blendmaster (Hamilton Beach, USA) blender which served as the pulper. The contents including different chemicals were pulped together for a total of 5min in blender [14]. The water temperature (40–45°C) did not change appreciably during pulping, even though there was no heating element connected to the blender. After pulping, the pH of the pulp in the blender was noted; for nearly all the chemicals used, the pH of pulp was approximately 9–10. Pulp obtained from pulping stage was subjected to one washing stage with 1l distilled water to eliminate residual chemical and ink separated from fibers."
4,Flotation,"3.2 Flotation The soap dosage naturally varies for different raw materials. A typical dosage for a mixture of old newspapers and magazines is 6–7kg soap per ton of recovered paper [1]. Calcium soap was 1% and created in situ by fatty acid [11]. The pulp was then transferred to the flotation cell and mixed in the cell for approximately 1min before checking the pH. After recording the pH, flotation was carried out for a total of 10min by activating an air inlet located below the stirring shaft. Air injected by a diffuser with flow rate 11/min, the average bubble size was about 0.5mm (size of bubbles covers a large spectrum and depends primarily on the type of air injector and the hydrodynamic parameters) and velocity of mixer was chosen 200rpm that has maximum efficiency for separation of 5–20μm particles [15]. The froth was then scraped off the top of the flotation cell by hand using a small paddle. Care was taken not to scrape too deeply into the froth, as this raises the risk of collecting paper fibers along with the ink. Periodically, the sides of the cell and the impeller were washed down with water to collect ink and paper. In some cases the froth becomes thinner or sinks. Further down into the cell as flotation proceeds, water should be poured into the cell to raise the froth layer high enough so that it can be scraped efficiently. Fig. 2 shows the four steps of the deinking procedure as employed in this study. After 10min of flotation, the air flow was stopped by turning off the air inlet on the impeller. Then, the deinked pulp from the flotation cell was carefully washed by 1l distilled water. The deinked pulp was then set to dry overnight after screening and pressing the final pulp by hand. To determine the efficiency of deinking, the pulp has to be fitted into a form suitable for testing; this is achieved by re-forming paper sheets (known as handsheets or brightness pads) from the pulp [16]."
5,Preparation of handsheets,"3.3 Preparation of handsheets The procedure to make the handsheets was adopted from Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) as the TAPPI Test Method T218 om-91 [8]. This test method suggested using 3g of dried pulp to form the sheets. Each 3g pulp sample was placed separately into the blender and diluted to 1l with distilled water. It was pulped for a total of 25–30s. The funnel used in this procedure was a 10cm inner diameter funnel with a perforated plate and connected to a 2l suction flask. The deinked pulp was carefully poured into funnel with care to rinse out the blender and collect all of paper. Once the handsheets were prepared by filtration, the excess water was removed before being set aside to dry using a machine press with a metal plate on the base and a clean piece of the larger filter on top. The press was lowered onto the top metal plate by a lever and pressure was applied for a total of 1min to squeeze out as much of the remaining water as possible from handsheet. After pressing each handsheet, they were placed under a fan to dry completely."
6,Measurement of brightness,"3.4 Measurement of brightness The brightness test was used to determine the amount of ink removed, which is common paper industry tests used to measure numerically the degree of reflectance of a paper sample when exposed to blue light at a wavelength of 457±0.5nm [17]. In general, the more the ink removed, the brighter are the sheets. Brightness test was done using brightness meter (Zeiss, West Germany) available at the Institute of Standards & Industrial Research of Iran. The tests consist of calibrating the brightness meter using a small magnesium oxide plate of certain brightness. The handsheet was placed over meter aperture, which was about 2–2.5cm in diameter. A 500g weight was placed over the sheet to ensure that no light escaped from the aperture. A digital readout reported the percentage brightness of the sheet at different points on a handsheet. The measurements were then averaged to get an average brightness value for the experiment."
7,Ink specks analysis and dirt count,"3.5 Ink specks analysis and dirt count Besides brightness gain, it is also necessary to determine the amount of visible ink specks on the deinked handsheets. The latter measure is considered even more important than the brightness gain for the deinking of newspaper. More than 90% of all dirt particles in recycled fiber processing are below a diameter of 20μm which is invisible to the naked eye [6]. The standard test for dirt count in pulp [18] and in paper and paperboard [19] developed by TAPPI counts ink particles only larger than 0.02mm2 or approximately 160μm in diameter. The methods provide a measure of the apparent dirt area on background using the TAPPI Dirt Estimation Chart. An invert microscope (wild Heerbrudd plan l×) with enlargement power of 400 was used to analyze the images of the handsheets. Five sample regions chosen randomly for each handsheet made from deinked pulp, with 2.5mm×5mm area, were analyzed; therefore, ink specks with diameter as low as 24μm can be detected. Image below certain threshold gray level is recognized as dirt, while the rest is considered the background."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Pulping stage,"4.1 Pulping stage Among the different waste papers available in Iran, newspaper “GHODS” with Ortho Printing black ink (11201133.NG20 & B/N=T50611727) was chosen. The brightness of paper before printing was 64% ISO. The different alcohols with one hydroxyl group and one to seven carbon atoms in alkyl chain used for this study are listed in Table 2 . The oxygen atom in alcohols is capable to associate with hydrogen-bonding network in water. When it is attached to a hydrophobic group its effect is diminished or even eliminated if the hydrophobic group is large enough. The alcohol deinking efficiency can be dependent upon its solubility. The aqueous solubility of alcohol molecule will depend upon the relative strengths of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic effects. The lower alcohols are miscible with water, where the hydrophilic –OH group constitutes a large part of the molecule. As the hydrophobic alkyl group becomes larger, water solubility decreases. Therefore, solubility is dependent upon the number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain (n). For primary alcohols: - If n is less than 4 the alcohol is quite soluble in water. - If n is 5–7 then the alcohol is sparingly soluble. - If n is greater than 8 the alcohol is practically insoluble. Thus, the number of carbons in chosen alcohols was considered between 1 and 7. Due to low solubility and low frothing power, the alcohols with eight carbons and more were not used. It must be noted that for practical and industrial purposes, the borderline between solubility and insolubility in water occurs at about five carbon atoms for normal primary alcohol. Besides the solubility, the other properties of alcohols such as surface tension, viscosity, wetting, etc., will depend upon this carbon chain [20]. At first, the effect of alcohols was studied only in one main stage of pulping alone. In each experience the pulp was washed with 1l distilled water (washing step) and then the brightness and intensity of ink spot were measured. The results are shown in Table 3 . The brightness of pulp with adding any chemical was 50.1% ISO and intensity of ink was more than 100,000cm−2. A gain of 1.7 in brightness was obtained as result of using 1.5% NaOH dispersant. Eight percent ISO amelioration was also observed with adding 3% H2O2. The higher brightness was achievable by applying the alcohol instead of H2O2 with the same dosage (3%). The maximum brightness of about more than 65% ISO was achieved by heptyl alcohol. The ink stripping mechanism using alcohol may consist of wetting of the surface due to an interface tension between the alcohol and the film surface which is as low as possible, then diffusion of alcohol and breakage of dipolar bonds and hydrogen bonds of the polymer chains constituting the ink film binder, also breaking the adhesive bonds between the film binder and the substrate, and finally lifting the ink particle to the bulk of liquid. Binders, e.g. acrylic resins, are partially responsible for forming the ink film. They envelop the pigment and bind it firmly to the print substrate. The brightness obtained by methyl alcohol was minimum and nearly the same by hydrogen peroxide. Many chemicals produce wet surfaces and foam but are not considered surfactants, e.g. methyl alcohol in aqueous solution. Methyl alcohol is not considered as the surface active agent because its concentration at the interface is the same as in bulk of liquid [21]. Its mixture with water may acts as a better wetting agent than water alone, probably by faster wetting of interfiber hydrogen bonds and faster swelling. Alcohols are also solvent of ionic compounds due to their –OH group and nonionic compounds due to their hydrophobic alkyl group. Another possible mechanism is that some binders and additives in a printing ink that cannot hydrolyze at high pH of alkaline water can dissolve better in this media. This could improve the water solubility of the ink, which compensates the role of H2O2. The measurements were averaged for straight, branched chain, and cyclic alcohols with the same number of carbon atoms, to get an average parameter value for the experiment. The average brightness values are presented in Fig. 3 . An increase in brightness was observed with increase in length of alkyl chain. The curve shows a steady increase in brightness, up to C5 atoms. Its variations are very significant for the case of C6 and C7 atoms in alkyl chain. It can be related to structure of hydrophobic part of the molecule. Short structure with a hydrophilic group at the end (–OH), described as “stump”, is only wetting and foaming agent but not a detergent. Long structure with a hydrophilic group at the end (–OH), described as “rod”, is not only wetting and foaming agent but also a detergent. Three basic concepts of solubility, adsorption at a surface, and formation of micelles (microphase) may explain the observed phenomenon in the case of C6 and C7 atoms in alkyl chain. The low solubility of these two alcohols gives adsorption and form micelle. The concentration of these alcohols is higher at the liquid/ink particle interface than in the bulk of liquid. Generally, it is adsorption at the interface that gives the surface active effects of wetting, emulsification, foaming, dispersing of ink particles, and detergency. It is also the micellar properties that give the solution and bulk properties of alcohol such as viscosity and solubilization. These two alcohols, as nonionic surfactants, control the surface tension of solution and cause the formation of micelles and microemulsions in the solution of low surface tension. Alkyl chain affect micelles formation and this effect increases with alkyl chain length. These micelles could affect their interaction with pigment and may improve the water solubility of the binder and pigment [21]. This effect is more significant for C7 atoms than C6 atoms. For alcohols with C7 atoms in alkyl chain, we achieved the brightness more than initial brightness of paper before printing. Therefore, by application of alcohol with long chain, it concludes that pulping and washing stages can be considered sufficient as deinking stages. Fig. 4 shows these values for intensity of ink spots. We observed high intensity and low variations for C1–C5 atoms and low intensity and high variations for C6–C7 atoms. Alcohols of C1–C5 atoms are totally soluble in water at pulping conditions (3% applied alcohol based on dry weight of paper is below the solubility limit of each alcohol). Their detergency, degradation of polymeric bonds of binder, and de-cross-linking of ink particles/substrate were enhanced by long alkyl chain. Comparing with methyl alcohol or H2O2, these values are about half by using alcohols with C7 atoms. In the case of C6 or C7 atoms, the detached pigments are partitioned between microemulsions of alcohols and the bulk solution. It could be related to heteroflocculation of pigments–alcohols and the tendency of pigments (carbon black) and binders (resin) to distribute more in microemulsions of alcohol than in bulk solution. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the longer the alkyl chain in the alcohol the larger number of pigments and binders will be present in the microemulsions at the same alcohol concentration."
10,Flotation stage,"4.2 Flotation stage In this case, the effect of alcohols was studied only in one main stage of flotation alone. On the other hand, we investigated the deinking efficiency of four steps: pulping/washing/flotation/washing, while the conditions of pulping and chemical used were not changed with optimum values cited in literature (i.e. NaOH: 1.5% and H2O2: 3%) but chemical used in flotation stage changed. The effect of alcohols and hydrogen peroxide used in flotation stage was compared. Because of good frothing properties of alcohols, each experience was done with and without calcium soap. Table 4 shows the results. The amount of soap was 1% and peroxide and alcohol was 3%. The comparison of results shows that the combination of soap and each alcohol gives more brightness than the combination of soap and peroxide. Flotation stage with adding peroxide ameliorates the brightness of pulp, obtained in pulping stage, only by 0.5% ISO. The role of peroxide is to break the bonds in ink networks, which can help to detach print from fibers, and also create smaller print particles. These smaller particles may float better, which will decrease speckiness. Using alcohol in flotation stage instead of peroxide with the same optimum dosage gives the more gain of brightness. The gain of about 1.5–15% ISO was obtained as result of using different alcohols. It can be related to frothing power of alcohols and their froth stability, a relatively quiescent region compared to the dynamic, turbulent region where bubbles are generated. The results showed that higher brightness was obtained by a normal aliphatic alcohol than its branch-chain isomer. The chemical structure of the various types of alcohols as frothers exerts a marked influence on the frothing power and froth stability. Experimental data available in literature [13] show that for monohydroxylated alcohols, higher frothing power was exhibited by a normal alcohol than its branch-chain isomers which conclude the results in accordance with ours. Using alcohol alone instead of soap–peroxide or soap–alcohol more brightness was always achieved. It is very difficult to consider the frothing properties of the frother alone in a flotation system as, although these neutral frothers are not meant to interact with the ink particle or other reagents, interaction occur which can change the overall rheological properties of the froths formed. All alcohols studied are polar oriented at air–liquid interface with the alkyl chain pointing away from the liquid. For all alcohols, there is a well-ordered hydrogen-bonding network at the interface. In this system, the long chain alcohols must take a position like that of the soap molecules with their polar groups oriented toward the water layer and their hydrocarbon tails toward the air bubble center. Alcohols could affect their stability and their interaction with pigments. Also, in the long chain alcohol, the heteroflocculation might occur between pigments and micelles of alcohol to form microemulsion. Aggregation of microemulsions as immiscible phases with air bubble results in high separation performance. Effect of the number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain on the average measured value of brightness is shown in Fig. 5 . In addition, the more the number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain the more gain was achieved. The froth volume increased with application of alcohol of higher number of carbon atoms. It shows a steady increase in froth volume with up to seven carbons and confirms the curve obtained for froth volume versus number of carbons in literature [13]. The maximum difference was in case of C7 atom in alkyl chain (about 14 units). As the alcohols are the nonionic surfactants, when n is less than 4 the alcohol is quite soluble in water but its surfactant properties are minimal. When n is 5–7 then the alcohol is sparingly soluble but the surfactant properties are at the maximum [21]. Thus, the solubility and practical nonionic surfactant properties are related. However, the relationship is not simple. For monohydroxylated alcohols, it was shown that the water solubility and the froth stability were influenced by the nonpolar portions of the molecule and, if a chain length of greater than eight carbon atoms was used, in a single or branch chain, the reduction in surface tension with concentration was sufficiently large to produce stable froths that would be too stable to handle easily in a flotation system. In the case of alcohol with any alkyl chain, we could achieve the brightness more than initial brightness of paper before printing. Fig. 6 shows values for intensity of ink spots. It decreases smoothly with number of carbon atoms in each combination. Alcohol alone is more effective than soap–alcohol combination. The difference between achieved number of ink spots decreases with number of carbon atoms in two cases of soap–alcohol and alcohol alone. On the other hand, the influence of chain length on deinking efficiency is more in the case of soap–alcohol than in the case of alcohol alone. The surface tension of alcohol/soap solution progressively decreases with increasing chain length of the straight-chain alcohol added. The alcohols affect micellar properties of calcium soap solution, i.e. micellar stability, polarity of micelle interior, critical micelle concentration (CMC), etc. The influence of long chain alcohols on the micellar stability of calcium soap solution is related to foaming properties such as foam ability, dynamic and equilibrium surface tension, and surface viscosity. The long chain alcohol causes an increase in micellar stability, due to the ion-dipole interaction between the soap and alcohol. Since the equilibrium surface tension for the soap/alcohol mixture is significantly lower than that for the pure soap solution, more foam is generated. Isomeric alcohols with identical main chain length exhibit similar behavior. The effect of isomeric alcohols with the same total carbon number on the surface tension of soap depends on the branching ratio of the alcohol. The effect of alcohol addition is to decrease the CMC of calcium soap surfactant due to the penetration of the micellar structure by the alcohol molecules. Also, the decrease of the CMC is greater for longer alcohols and for larger amounts of alcohol. Fig. 7 shows the effect of alcohol in flotation stage while its dosage changed. In this case, 1% soap was also used in combination with alcohol. Alkyl chain with higher number of carbon atoms gave higher brightness. For each alcohol, the brightness increased with dosage of alcohol and maximum of this gain was only about 2.5% ISO for all of alkyl chains. With increasing alcohol dosage from 5% to higher values, no sensible increase in brightness was observed. However, in the case of C7 alkyl chain a little decrease was observed. For a particular class of compounds like alcohols, the froth ability and froth stability can be related, in general, to the extent of reduction in equilibrium surface tension with concentration. However, other factors such as surface viscosity, bulk viscosity, and diffusion of surface active molecule to the surface can influence froth stability. In general, the frothing power and froth stability rise as the frother concentration is increased. At high concentrations, in the case of the frothers of very limited solubility such as alcohols of C7 atoms at dosage of more than 5%, the froth stability decreases. The insoluble material itself has a very low surface tension and inclusion of small droplets of it in the air–liquid interface of a liquid film causes the droplet to spread rapidly over the surface, owing the large differential interfacial tension between the droplet and the surrounding medium. This rapid spreading in turn causes a rapid thinning of the liquid film to the point of rupture and an unstable froth results. Due to this reason, the dosage more than 6% and also the alcohols of more than C7 atoms have not used in this work. The alcohol dosage more than 3% (equivalent to peroxide dosage) in flotation stage was not recommended because of environment and economic problems, therefore, the low dosage of alcohol is proposed. Fig. 8 shows values for intensity of ink spots. Fig. 9 shows the effect of alcohol alone in flotation stage with different dosages. Soap was not used in combination with alcohol in this case. The brightness, in general, in flotation stage without soap is higher than with soap. Alkyl chain with higher number of carbon atoms gave higher brightness. The brightness with the alkyl chain of C6 and C7 atoms was much higher than the alkyl chain of C1–C5 atoms. The brightness increases, with dosage of alcohol from 2 to 7% for each used alcohol. The maximum brightness gain, for all of alkyl chains was only about 2.5% ISO. The hydrophobic group, e.g. a long chain alkyl group, is not repelled by water, as the attraction of the hydrocarbon chain for water is approximately the same as that for itself. In fact, at low concentrations of alcohol in water the hydrocarbon chains will actually lie flat on the surface (air–water interface). It is only when there is a sufficient number of alcohol molecules at the interface that hydrocarbon chain of alcohol molecule is oriented normally to air–water interface. Frother type and concentration are likely to control the foaming properties in the presence of particles through a number of mechanisms [22]. The gas holdup is very sensitive to surface active agents found in multi-component liquids. The magnitude of the impact of surface active agents on phase holdup depends primarily on the operating conditions. The presence of alcohol as a nonionic surface active agent increases the gas holdup and, therefore, interfacial surface area [23]. The interfacial condition requires to establish as there is a balance between adsorption and desorption due to thermal motions. Thus, surface activity should be considered a dynamic phenomenon. Alcohol as a frother affects bubble dynamics in three ways. First, the average bubble size is reduced due to a reduction in surface tension. Alcohol with long chain tends to accumulate at the gas–liquid interface and lower interfacial tension. This leads to an increase in the bubble interfacial area and a decrease in its rise velocity. Perhaps, we should entertain that alcohol as a frother may condition the water as an air break-up medium [24]. Second, surface tension gradients are developed around the bubble surface immobilizing it, which leads to an increase in drag force and thus a reduction in the bubble rise velocity to the free surface of liquid in the flotation cell [23]. Finally, the addition of solute (e.g. alcohols) to liquid can enhance but usually severely hinder bubble coalescence. Coalescence requires the out flow of liquid between adjacent bubbles. The coalescence of bubbles is inhibited due to surface tension gradients slowing the drainage rate of liquid between two adjacent bubbles, i.e. Gibbs–Marangoni effect. The mechanisms invoked may retard (even reverse the flow) include Gibbs elasticity and the Marangoni effect driven by surface tension gradients and increased surface viscosity due to structural effects deriving from the nature of the nonionic surfactant [23,24]. The frother's modest surface activity then helps it stay at the air surface. On a practical side, it seems as well that frothers give the large surface area of gas injected into flotation cells. The magnitude of anti-coalescence will be a function of concentration, preserving the concept of a critical coalescence concentration (CCC) [24]. All three effects tend to keep the average bubble size small and rise velocity low. This in turn affects the gas holdup, phase mixing, and interphase mass transfer [23]. Gas holdup is always lowest for the tap water. Gas holdup only marginally increases with increasing alcohol concentration and molecular weight, with the latter being more important. Chain length and alcohol dosage can affect the flotation deinking efficiency due to their influence on contact angle between ink particles and air bubbles. It increases with increasing chain length and alcohol dosage. The more the contact angle, the more are hydrophobic properties of ink surface. Fig. 10 shows the value for intensity of ink spots."
11,Peroxide free deinking,"4.3 Peroxide free deinking In this case, we eliminated use of hydrogen peroxide in both pulping and flotation stages. Alcohol, with the same dosage of hydrogen peroxide, was used instead of peroxide in two mentioned stages. The results were compared with that obtained by application of hydrogen peroxide in two stages. Alcohol deinking presents more brightness than peroxide as Fig. 11 shows. The maximum brightness (about 70% ISO) obtained by alcohol of C7 carbon atoms in alkyl chain. Fig. 12 shows these values for intensity of ink spots. These two figures show that two possibilities exist in order to achieve a certain high brightness or small number of ink spots. First, increase the dosage of alcohol without changing its chain length. Second, increase the chain length of alcohol without changing its dosage. As –CH2– group in hydrocarbon chain increases, the consumption of alcohol decreases about one third for the same brightness. As a general result of our work, deinking efficiency increases with increasing alcohol dosage and molecular weight, with the latter being more important. This phenomenon is known “Traub law”. The frothers with C6 to C7 carbon atoms produce fine-textured, fairly selective froths that are brittle and, therefore, do not give problems with entrainment or excessive launder stability. They are sparingly soluble in water but are easily dispersed and are used undiluted, although in certain applications they can be premixed with collector."
12,Conclusion,"In this work the effect of alcohols, which are normally used in mineral flotation as frother, was developed in deinking flotation. Combination of soap and an alcohol instead of soap and peroxide in flotation stage can improve ink removal efficiency. Application of alcohol alone in flotation stage, compared with soap–hydrogen peroxide or soap–alcohol gave higher brightness of the deinked pulp. The higher brightness was achieved with the number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain. Some general conclusions can be reached on effect of carbons in the alkyl chain, or chain length, on the froth properties generated by alcohols. With growing alkyl chain solubility of alcohol decreases and also frother power increases with the number of carbon atoms up to 6 or 7. The results have shown the type and percent of alcohol as a frother has pronounced influence on the overall brightness. This particularly pronounced in which the law stability of the froth recovery, because of the complexity and interactive nature of processes occurring within the froth phase. Alcohols against a dispersant such as hydrogen peroxide have no destructive effect on fibers and are preferred agent to gives higher brightness. Frother remaining in the water may be undesirable from environmental and water recycling perspectives, but those and economic point of view are other matters."
