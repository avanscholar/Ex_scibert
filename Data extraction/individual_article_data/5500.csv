0,Introduction,"Diesel fuel has been extensively used for engineering machinery, automobiles, and shipping power equipment due to its high fuel efficiency and excellent drivability [1]. But, for the past several decades, the oil crisis is becoming increasingly serious and the combustion of fossil-based resources today occupies over two-thirds of the global dominating energy utilization [2], which also reflects our overwhelming reliance on fossil fuels as usual. In addition, the excessive consumption of mineral fuels leads to various types of air pollutants including oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO) and other harmful ingredients, and around 63% of greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are derived from the direct combustion of fuels [3]. Thus, novel approaches for the production of green and sustainable renewable energy, particularly biofuels which only emit slight CO2 gas in overall life-cycle [4,5], have become one of the top research items in engine development. Ethanol, which is yielded mainly from the sugary or starchy materials, e.g. corn, sugar cane, waste biomass materials, has an abundant feedstock base for its production in the global scope and becomes the most broadly used bio-fuels today [6–8]. Statistical data showed that, in USA, over 7.3 billion gasoline-equivalent gallons of ethanol were served as petrol additives in 2009 [6]. The International Energy Agency also indicated that the ethanol supply would climb from 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) in 2010 to 3.4mboe/d in 2035 [9]. Moreover, considering the favorable physical and chemical properties such as the higher oxygen content or octane number, ethanol receives considerable attention and has been the most studied alcohol for blending with conventional mineral fuels [10–15]. In reality, ethanol has been extensively used in gasoline engines, but of its not yet implemented large scale commercial on diesel engines. Generally, there are several serious obstacles for using ethanol/diesel blend: (1) Defects exist in the first generation biofuels, and major issue is that the current ethanol manufacture is restricted by its potential intimidation to food security and the “blend-wall” problem [16–18]. Therefore, the further application in diesel engines is restricted to some extent. (2) Ethanol has very finite miscibility in diesel fuel [19–22]. Thus, the ethanol/diesel mixtures present the phase separation. Ever since the development of high efficient, low cost pathways for producing bio-ethanol from cellulose biomass (second generation) and algal biomass (third generation) [23,24], the primary drawback has been transformed into the second issue. The ethanol/diesel blends can assume phase separation over a wide range of temperatures and water contents due to their difference in chemical structures and characteristics [25,27]. Fernando and Hanna [26] surveyed that most ethanol/diesel mixtures separated promptly into two distinct phases at room temperature. Therefore, in order to guarantee the phase stabilities of whole mixture systems and the blending fuel properties, some additives are required to be added [8,13,14,20,22]. Biodiesel is frequently used to act as a co-solvent or an emulsifying agent. Chotwichien et al. [28] researched that utilization of palm oil methyl, ethyl, and butyl esters as co-solvents in pure ethanol/diesel blend, and eventually, the addition of different palm oils improved the solubility and compensated the loss of density, viscosity, cetane number, etc. of ternary mixtures. Makareviciene et al. [19] and Kwanchareon et al. [29] observed the consistent result as Chotwichien et al. but also indicated the water tolerance of diesel-biodiesel-ethanol fuel blends were clearly not ideal. Kwanchareon et al. [29] explained that presence of just bits of water (5% water in volume) enhanced the polarity of the hydroxyl group of ethanol molecule and as a result, non-polar diesel could not be compatible with aqueous ethanol in any proportion at room temperature. De Caro et al. [21] further discovered that pure ethanol was greatly soluble in diesel at contents of about 0–30% and 70–100%, while most zones of miscibility turned cloudiness when the water content of ethanol surpassed 1%. In other words, the water resistance of three-component systems ultimately could embody the soluble ability of co-solvents just like phase separation temperature. In fact, the ambient water should be inhaled inevitably during the storage and transportation process, which readily destructs the stabilization of ethanol/diesel blend. But actually, when the blends ensure complete solubility, the appropriate amount of water in fuel is beneficial to the engine combustion and emissions [30–32]. Chang et al. [31] studied a diesel engine generator running on blends of 20vol.% ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) and only 0.5vol.% water with diesel fuel (ABE20W0.5 for short). They concluded that ABE20W0.5 enhanced the BTE (brake thermal efficiencies) by 1.92–2.49%, which corresponded with a decreased BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) of 1.94–2.63%, and significantly reduced NOx and PM emission factors by 23.5–27.0% and 17.8–33.1%, respectively, when compared with the results of ABE20W0 at various engine loads. Martinez-Frias et al. [32] investigated that a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine with high-efficiency heat recovery could work on a 35% ethanol-in-water blend while attaining a high BTE (38.7%) and a very less NOx emissions (1.6ppm). Similar results have also been obtained by Olberding et al. [33], which they used hydrous ethanol with 30% water in gasoline engine and demonstrated that hydrous ethanol addition showed higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx and CO emissions than pure gasoline fuel. Besides, Martinez-Frias et al. [32] and Shapouri et al. [34,35] highlighted the view that aqueous ethanol should pay more attention, since large amounts of extra money and up to 37% of the total output energy (ethanol and co-products) in ethanol production were spent in water removal. In total extra 37% output energy for water removal, the distillation covered 23% and the dehydration covered 14%. Meanwhile, Ladisch and Dyck [36] and Munsin et al. [37] also presented that the major energy depletion for the distillation of ethanol started sharply increasing once ethanol concentrations exceeded 90vol.%. This means that the application of hydrous ethanol should be larger than 10vol.% water content based on the economic manner. Generally, in order to address the contradiction between the higher water content and phase separation in ethanol/diesel fuel blend, the best option for generating a homogenous mixture is to add a co-solvent with excellent soluble capacity [25]. Higher alcohols (C4 and larger) own hydrogen donor groups (OH) in association with molecular functional groups that accept hydrogen, which interact more strongly with the polar materials. Besides, through van der Walls forces, the non-polarity or low polarity carbon chains of higher alcohols possess good affinity with the hydrocarbons of diesel. For this reason, alcohol additives present a much better soluble performance in theory. And in reality, higher carbon-number alcohols, especially n-butanol as a relatively short straight-chain alcohol, have been applied as a co-solvent additive in ethanol/diesel and methanol/diesel blends [38,39], but the systematized researches on their ability to promote stability of hydrous ethanol have not yet been completely established. In addition, other higher carbon-number straight-chain alcohols and some different molecular structures such as branched, cyclic alcohols have also not been compared. Hence, in this research, different higher carbon-number alcohols have been mixed with 90% ethanol/diesel blends. Among these alcohols, n-butanol (4-carbon), n-hexanol (6-carbon), n-octanol (8-carbon) and n-dodecanol (12-carbon) were selected for investigating the influence of alcohol chain length, while the effect of straight and branched chain about solubility was studied via comparing with the result differences of four isomers of butanol (n-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol). Additionally, the influence of hydroxyl and ketone group was focused by using cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone as co-solvents. The critical tasks were to ascertain the phase behaviors of hydrous ethanol/diesel systems with various co-solvents and component concentrations, and the dependence upon ambient temperatures. And finally, through combined with physicochemical properties and soluble capacity of alcohol additives, a premium and stable alcohol co-solvent fuel should be obtained."
1,Materials and methods,"Conventional diesel fuel was supplied by Sinopec Co., Ltd., Beijing Yanshan Branch in this study. The water content of premium diesel is lower than 0.02vol.% and the amount of ash content accounts for 0.1wt.%, which has very little influence on solubility performance. Meanwhile, to avoid the effect of different diesel component such as aromatic content on phase behavior [20,40], the same diesel fuel was used for all experimental tests. The diverse higher carbon-number alcohols were used, which included analytical (AR) grade pure ethanol, n-butanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol, n-dodecanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, iso-butanol, tert-butanol and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade 2-butanol. All of them are received from Real & Lead Chemical Co., Ltd and can ensure the purity over 99.5% except cyclohexanol (99%). Additionally, hydrous ethanol with different purities, mainly 90% ethanol, obtained by mixing pure water at a corresponding proportion and would be fully utilized on following experiments. The properties of some representative fuels are shown in Table 1 . In addition, it should be noted that all of these alcohols can be produced by bio-methods according to recent publication [41–44], which means that part of petrochemical diesel fuel would be replaced simultaneously."
2,Phase stability,"2.1 Phase stability The physical appearance of the multi-component systems can be classified in five conditions as shown in Fig. 1 : (A) clear liquid one phase; (B) crystalline liquid one phase; (C) crystalline liquid two phases; (D) gel; (E) clear liquid two phases, of which gel is a frozen or non-moveable status and occurs at low temperatures because of the relatively high pour point of the mixture [28]. In general, the order of stability on remaining physical-states was (A)>(B)>(C)>(E) based on the study by Lee et al. [30], while gel was not included in their study work. In fact, in our present experiments, the gel state was quite stable under the tested three ambient temperatures. In this study, all of the blends had been kept static for 7days at a specified temperature when the titration method (detailed introduction in Section 2.2) was applied to judge visually phase boundaries of hydrous ethanol, diesel and higher alcohol. And finally, the phase behaviors of blended fuel were surveyed by using binary and ternary phase diagrams as previous study work [45]."
3,Splash-blending and stability test,"2.2 Splash-blending and stability test As a main method in this experiment, titration [46] is an analytical technique and allows the quantitative study of an analyte dissolved in a sample. This is based on a thorough chemical reaction between the analyte and a titrant of special concentration which is added to the sample. And the titrant is injected until the phase boundaries are arisen. In this paper, one section is the temperature of phase separation of anhydrous ethanol/diesel. The blends of anhydrous ethanol and diesel were prepared, and anhydrous ethanol ratios varied from 0 to 90vol.% in 10vol.% increments. These mixtures were placed into a digital constant temperature incubator with 0.1°C precision, and gradually improved the setting temperature until the one-phase clear blends were visually observed. And for the other section, titration method was utilized, and the blend on hydrous ethanol (90vol.% ethanol and 10vol.% water) and diesel fuel was acted as an analyte. For subsequent works, hydrous ethanol/diesel mixtures were blended beforehand at different ratios that varied from 0 to 100vol.% in 10vol.% increments. The initial volume of these blends was set to 5mL, and then the given alcohol (titrant) was gradually added into the centrifuge tube by a high-precision pipette until phase boundaries of ternary system appeared. During the titration reaction, in order to obtain a homogeneous blend rapidly, a vortex mixer with a rotating capacity of about 5000rpm was used. After these processes, centrifuge tubes were placed in the incubator for observing the physical states of mixed tri-component fuels. And similarly, mixtures of the higher alcohol and hydrous ethanol concentrations ranging from 0 to 100vol.% were titrated with diesel fuel to cover completely the ternary phase diagram [46,47]. It must be emphasized that all of the homogeneous mixtures via injecting a co-solvent should have maintained motionless at 0, 15 and 30°C ambient temperatures. But owing to the formation of the liquid crystal phase under lower temperature, some of the ternary fuels generated needle crystals at 0°C which would be slow to disappear as the system temperature rose. Furthermore, the needle crystals were occurred in less than 30min when the aqueous ethanol was used, this needle crystal would be slow to disappear as the system temperature rose. However, this phenomenon did not appear as using the anhydrous ethanol at lower temperature. Thereby, for accurately judging the phase behavior and ensuring the comparability of the test, the lowest temperature was increased to 5°C and the result must be affirmed by observing the ultimate state of any mixture after the long-term (7days) standing."
4,Results and discussions,"The specifications of diesel and various anhydrous alcohol fuels are listed in Table 1. This data set presents several remarkable distinctions among the fuels and will provide a rational basis for the selection of co-solvent. The following conclusions can be received from Table 1. (1) A higher RON (research octane number) corresponds to lower ignition tendency, which also results in a negatively effect on diesel engine combustion control. And an increase in the carbon atom of alcohol fuels leads to a decrease in the octane number, making the high alcohols more suitable for diesel engines. Moreover, because of the stronger polar interaction which is reflected by the water-soluble, higher alcohol shows the superior solubility with diesel fuel. (2) Typically the oxygen content (wt.%) of alcohols reduces with the increase of carbon number. This directly contributes to the decreased fuel consumption and a better mileage, indicated by the alcohol’s density and lower heating value (LHV) as well. Considering the addition of ethanol to diesel must reduce the LHV of blends, it therefore should be compensated for by adding the co-solvent. However, for these fuel properties, the listed co-solvent additives can only guarantee not to further decline. (3) The heat of vaporization of alcohols is significantly higher than that of diesel, which means that the ability to start the engine in cold weather will be reduced with the addition of any alcohol. In addition, the density of straight alcohol increases with the enhancement of carbon and hydrogen content. In general, the higher density contributes to much stronger flow resistance, resulting in higher viscosity. The appropriate viscosity, which can be obtained by mixing a higher carbon-number alcohol into ethanol/diesel blends, has positive impacts on reducing the wear of fuel pump and injector. Meantime, the size of fuel drop, atomization quality and jet penetration will be more similar to conventional diesel fuel as higher carbon alcohols are added into ethanol/diesel blends. (4) Although the flash point temperature of alcohol increases with longer hydrocarbon chain, yet flash point value is dominated normally by the blending component in the mixture with the lowest flash point. Thus for the multi-component systems containing ethanol, the storage and transportation of them must be strictly managed as well. Besides, the change trend of pour point value is inversely proportion to that of flash point measurement. When the blend oil reaches the pour point temperature, it turns to a non-moveable system, resulting in clogging fuel lines and filters easily. Nevertheless, with regard to the ultra-low pour points of ethanol, the gel state should arise infrequently."
5,Effects of temperature and ethanol purity on phase stability,"3.1 Effects of temperature and ethanol purity on phase stability Pure ethanol and diesel fuel are relatively easy to mix at a higher temperature. However, the solubility falls sharply with the descending ambient temperature and eventually leads to the phase separation of anhydrous ethanol/diesel system, as shown in Fig. 2 . Absolute ethanol/diesel mixtures are completely miscible only with ambient temperature above about 40°C no matter how many ethanol fractions in blends. It is rational to explain that, as temperature rises, the thermal motion will be more violent which is conducive to the diffusion and dispersion of molecules. Meantime, it shows that the ethanol concentration in blends affects the solubility. With the increase of anhydrous ethanol concentration, it needs higher ambient temperature to avoid phase separation. Until ethanol volumetric fraction reaches 50%, the temperature of phase separation goes to the peak value of 40°C. After, with the further increase of ethanol volumetric fractions, the temperature of phase separation decreases. As ethanol volumetric fraction reaches 90%, the phase can avoid separation as long as ambient temperature is higher than 5°C. So, it can be found that the solubility is the worst as the volume ratio of ethanol and diesel is 1:1. To study the effect of ethanol purity on the phase behavior, E20-D (represented 20vol.% specific purity ethanol and 80vol.% diesel fuel blend) and E85-D with different water content are prepared in advance. Then, n-hexanol is selected as a titrant. Fig. 3 presents the phase behavior of E20-D and E85-D at 5°C with different water content in ethanol. As observed in Fig. 3, the addition of n-hexanol is at least 0.15 and 0.05mL (accounted for 2.9 and 1vol.%) for E20-D and E85-D respectively under anhydrous state to maintain clear liquid one phase, while it can be found from Fig. 2 that both of them need 30°C and 15°C respectively to avoid phase separation without co-solvents. Additionally, with the decreasing of ethanol purity, the need on the co-solvent increases dramatically. For example, if 90% ethanol concentration is applied, the minimum dosage of n-hexanol is 1.3 and 2.05mL to form homogeneous blend at 5°C. Accordingly, the ratio of co-solvent has accounted for 20.6 and 29.1vol.% for E20-D and E85-D, respectively. This phenomenon directly reflects that the presence of water can damage the stabilization of mixtures easier and thus needs more co-solvents addition."
6,Effects of alcohol molecular structures on phase stability,"3.2 Effects of alcohol molecular structures on phase stability 3.2.1 Effects of alcohol chain length on phase stability The phase behavior of ternary systems on 90% ethanol, diesel and different normal monohydric alcohols including n-butanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol and n-dodecanol have been tested at 5, 15 and 30°C and the results have been shown in Fig. 4 . It can be observed that the blend of 90% ethanol and diesel is almost insoluble due to the existence of water, whereas the four kinds of normal monohydric alcohols are miscible with hydrous ethanol or diesel at temperatures of 5–30°C. However, with the enlargement of setting temperatures, Fig. 4 shows that the areas of phase separation tend to decline, which also means the decreased reliance on the addition of co-solvents. Taking n-butanol for instance, the greatest blending of it to keep phase stable at 5°C, reduces by 6.3% and 26.9%, when ambient temperature increases to 15°C and 30°C respectively. Besides, Fig.4a and b illustrates that the gel will be emerged because the blends has higher pour point value as large proportions of n-dodecanol are added. The gel is gradual to melt as the temperature increases. From this perspective, it can also confirmed that, a high ambient temperature or a relatively low pour point of the additive play a positive role for the comprehensive and proper settlement of unstable phases of blends. A detailed titration values of n-hexanol to ensure one phase clear liquid of hydrous ethanol and diesel at 5°C have been shown in Table 2 . Meantime, to avoid phase separation, the blends need more co-solvents with the increase of ethanol fractions for all four higher alcohols, and the dosages reach the peak once the mixed solution of 90% ethanol and diesel with a volume ratio of 60:40. Then, as the fractions of hydrous ethanol rise further, the demands for additives are on gradual decrease. To be specific, the physical-state curve in ternary diagram generally shows an irregular parabola under the function of those higher alcohols. But for the blend containing n-dodecanol in 90% ethanol/diesel fuel, the phase separation points are most nearly in a line with lower addition, which decreases the effect of the incompatibility of hydrous ethanol and fossil diesel. In addition, by comparing physical states of the same temperature in Fig. 4, it is observed that to just turn the unstable phase of 90% ethanol/diesel blends into liquid crystalline 1 phase, the maximum dosage obviously decreases by 37.5–38.8%, 49.3–51.3% and 61.2–66.3% at temperatures of 5–30°C in relation to n-butanol for n-hexanol, n-octanol and n-dodecanol respectively. The result indicates that the requirements of the co-solvent additives are much less as alcohol chain length is much longer, while the pace of reduction diminishes gradually. Furthermore, in consideration of the possibility of the production of gel, it is clear that the normal alcohol with a longer chain is not always prefect. 3.2.2 Effects of functional groups on phase stability Fig. 5 presents the effect of functional groups on phase stability and two co-solvents of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone at 5, 15 and 30°C. Meanwhile, the difference between straight structure and cyclic structure can be obtained through the comparison between cyclohexanol and n-hexanol which has been shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that it needs more cyclohexanol to avoid phase separation into 90% ethanol/diesel blend compared with the addition of n-hexanol at the same ambient temperature. For example, to form homogeneous mixture, the lowest requirement of n-hexanol is 2.05mL, 2.5mL and 2.7mL for E60-D at 5, 15 and 30°C respectively and decreases by 13.8–18.2vol.% compared with cyclohexanol. Besides, considering the difference of hydroxyl group and ketone group for the phase behavior, the solubility of the ternary system involving cyclohexanone is visibly lower in relation to that of cyclohexanol under the same conditions. For ensuring the just solubility of 90% ethanol/diesel mixtures at all ratios, the maximum addition of cyclohexanone is 36.6–48.1vol.% higher than that of n-hexanol at temperatures of 5–30°C, and is still 14.3–21.2vol.% higher than that of cyclohexnol with lower purity. And similarly, owing to the high pour point of cyclohexanol, the mixtures containing it from about 95–100% by volume also appear the gel at 5°C. In general, majority of higher alcohols are identified as bio-derived fuels and studies on the biological process required for their production are emerging [42,48,49]. Currently, Philips et al. [49] reported a sustainable approach to constantly produce n-hexanol by syngas fermentation utilizing Clostridium carboxidivorans in a low-cost medium. And these facts show that n-hexanol has not only better solubility than both cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone but also the potential of biological preparation with low-cost, which makes it one of the most effective potential additive fuels. 3.2.3 Effects of straight and branched chain on phase stability For the purpose of further studying the influence of straight and branched chain structures of alcohols on the phase stable, co-solvent in the three-component system was turned to butanol isomers, which had been intensively investigated as alternative fuels. Considering the differences of these results are slightly, only E20-D, E40-D, E50-D, E60-D and E80-D are selected as tested fuels. Meanwhile for that reason, the ternary phase diagram is not intuitive to show the trend and thus the binary histogram has been shown in Fig. 6 . It presents that the addition of n-butanol in 90% ethanol/diesel fuel is slightly diminished when compared with that of iso-butanol and tert-butanol at 5, 15 and 30°C. It proves that the straight chain alcohol as a co-solvent possesses more superior solubility performance than branched chain alcohols. However, all of the blends containing 2-butanol present a stronger solubility in the same conditions. This might be due to the fact that 2-butanol is HPLC grade while the other butanol isomers are AR grade. It should be noted that, to keep the same purity, only 2-butanol is HPLC grade and others are AR grade. Although the purity of them is basically the same, there may exist different impurity compositions between AR and HPLC grade just like the water content. And this also reflects that the impurity compositions of the blending component may be crucial to the phase stable of multi-component mixtures."
7,Conclusions,"To evaluate the potential for utilizing alcohol as an effective additive for hydrous ethanol/diesel mixtures, different alcohols were tested. Firstly, n-butanol (4-carbon), n-hexanol (6-carbon), n-octanol (8-carbon) and n-dodecanol (12-carbon) were selected for investigating the influence of alcohol chain length on solubility. Secondly, the effect of straight and branched chain on solubility was studied via comparing with four butanol isomers. Finally, various functional groups effects were studied by both cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone to represent hydroxy and ketone group. The main results can be summarized as follows: (1) The specifications of ethanol/diesel blends can be partially compensated for by adding a longer straight chain alcohol. (2) Pure ethanol/diesel mixtures of all proportions is completely soluble once ambient temperature exceeded about 40°C. With the increase of ethanol volumetric fractions in diesel fuel, the temperature of phase separation increases first and then decreases. The solubility is the worst as the volume ratio of ethanol and diesel is 1:1. (3) When various types of alcohols act as stabilizing agents in 90% ethanol/diesel blends at different component concentrations and temperatures (5, 15, and 30°C), it can be found that alcohols with higher carbon-numbers provide better miscible capacity, but a higher carbon-number alcohol such as n-dodecanol correlates with a lower pour point which leads to the gelling for the blends. The straight chain structure and hydroxy group shows a better hydrotropy than that of cyclic and branched structure and ketone group, respectively. (4) By combining all analysis results, n-hexanol and n-octanol can be recommended as a co-solvent additive for hydrous ethanol/diesel system due to the acceptable fuel properties and soluble performance."
