0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation, one of the most important chemical reactions, enables the conversion of petroleum-based feedstocks into various valued chemicals (e.g., carbonyl composites and epoxides) [1,2]. In all sorts of oxidative reactions, the conversion of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aromatic aldehydes is of vital importance, since the aromatic aldehydes are the indispensable feedstocks/intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [3,4]. In recent years, the selective photoredox organic catalysis is being widely investigated in different kinds of organic transformations with the aim of converting and storing solar energy into valuable chemicals in a sustained fashion. Besides, due to relatively benign conditions of the reactions and the controllable redox capabilities of the active species, photocatalytic organic synthesis is also attractive for the mechanistic studies [5–9]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop the efficient and selective systems for photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols with solar energy, especially when molecular oxygen is used as the green oxidant. Generally, in the photocatalysis processes, the photons with the energy (hv ) equal to or above the bandgap energy (Eg ) of the semiconductor are first absorbed, producing the electron-hole (e−-h+) pairs [10–12]. Then, the photo-stimulated charge carriers will separate and transfer to the surface of semiconductors to participate in the redox reactions [13–15]. The separation efficiency of the charge carriers is one of the crucial factors determining the overall efficiency of the photoredox catalysis [10,14,15]. It is well known that increasing the crystallinity of a semiconductor can significantly promote the splitting and separation of the e−-h+ pairs, and thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity [16–20]. Moreover, the promoted charge separation and transfer will accelerate the activation of oxygen by transferring more photoelectrons to the absorbed oxygen [12,21]. In addition, the interaction between the reactant, the product, and semiconductors also influence the reaction efficiency and products distribution [20–24]. Previous works have demonstrated that the surface properties of photocatalysts greatly affect the absorption of benzyl alcohol (BA) and desorption of benzaldehyde (BZH), and thus tuning the conversion (con.) and selectivity (sel.) of the photosynthetic reactions [20–24]. Based on these understandings, the synergistic modulation of the structure and surface properties of photocatalysts may be an effective approach to advance photocatalytic organic transformations, such as the conversion of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes. Recently, the ternary BCN semiconductor materials, which are made from carbon doping into BN matrix with bandgap to be modulated by the degree of carbon incorporation, have attracted significant research attention in photocatalysis owing to the distinctive mechanical, thermal, and electronic features [25–27]. The non-metal BCN semiconductors present photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, water splitting and organic synthesis [8,27–31]. For example, our group has very recently found that light-excited BCN can trigger the oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes with molecular O2 as the oxidant [32]. However, the overall activity remains moderate, mainly because of the rapid charge recombination on BCN and the sluggish surface redox kinetics. In fact, we have previously found that pristine BCN materials contain abundant oxygen, which may derive from the structure defects [25,32]. As known, the defect sites can act as recombination centers of photoinduced charges, leading to inferior performance of photocatalysts [33,34]. The reduction of oxygen can lower the defect density of the BCN materials to promote the charge separation efficiency. At the same time, alternating the oxygen concentration of BCN may also adjust the surface properties, thus modulating the microscopic reaction processes, such as the adsorption and desorption of reactants and reaction intermediates [20,35]. Herein, we develop a facile approach to regulate the structure and surface properties of BCN semiconductor by hydrogen reduction treatment. As expected, the oxygen defects of BCN decrease evidently, which efficiently promotes the separation of e−-h+ pairs, as evidenced by photoluminescence (PL) spectra, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and transient photocurrent. The physicochemical and surface characterizations indicate that the surface properties of BCN after hydrogen reduction treatment can be precisely modulated. The strengthened structure and surface features of BCN improve the oxygen activation as revealed by O2-TPD tests. Consequently, the optimized BCN photocatalyst exhibits high performance for selective oxidation of BA under visible light illumination with the conversion and selectivity of about 80 and 90 %, respectively, superior to those of the pristine BCN."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of BCN,"2.1 Synthesis of BCN Boron acid was chosen as the boron precursor, starch was selected as carbon source, urea and ammonia were used as nitrogen source [25,32,36]. All the precursors were first ground thoroughly, and then calcined in a tube furnace (1250 °C, 5 h) as the reported works [25,32]. The obtained samples were washed by the HCl solution (0.1 M, 80 °C), and dried at 60 °C."
3,Synthesis of hydrogen-treated BCN,"2.2 Synthesis of hydrogen-treated BCN The above-obtained BCN (0.1 g) was directly calcined under hydrogen atmosphere (5 % H2 was preliminarily treated at 500 °C for 1 h (Ar, 50 mL min−1), followed by cooling down to 50 °C. The above sample was subsequently mixed with O2 (50 mL min−1, 1 h, 298 K) and the Ar gas was employed to flush again for 1 h remove the physisorbed O2. The desorption outline was obtained by rising the temperature from 30 °C to 500 °C (10 °C min−1) until the TCD signal comes back to the baseline."
4,Adsorption measurements,"2.3 Adsorption measurements The photocatalyst (8 mg) was immersed into the BTF (10 mL) solution containing benzyl alcohol (0.1 mmol) or benzaldehyde (0.1 mmol). After adsorption saturation, the filtered solution was analyzed by using an Agilent Gas Chromatograph (GC, Agilent). The catalysts were washed by using water to wipe off the physical adsorption of BA and BZH and dried under vacuum [20]."
5,Detection of superoxide radical anion (O2 −) and hydroxyl radical ( OH),"2.4 Detection of superoxide radical anion (O2 −) and hydroxyl radical ( OH) 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was dispersed in methanol or water to collect the superoxide radical anion or hydroxyl radical by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Bruker model A300 spectrometer), respectively [20,21]."
6,Photocatalytic activity,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity The photoconversion of various aromatic alcohols was conducted under a normal condition [3,32,37]. 8 mg catalyst, 0.1 mmol alcohol and 3 mL benzotrifluoride (BTF) were added to a Pryex glass bottle (10 mL) and then a pressure of 0.1 MPa oxygen was injected into the reactor under powerful stirring. After 30 min, the catalyst well dispersed in the solution and reached adsorption equilibrium, followed by irradiation with 400 nm LED light. After reaction for a certain time, the catalyst was removed, and the liquid supernatant was analyzed by using GC. Correspondingly, the formula of conversion (con.) and selectivity (sel.) were defined as follows. (1) Con. (%) = [(C0 – Calcohol)/C0] × 100 (2) Sel. (%) = [Caldehyde/(C0 – Calcohol)] × 100 Where C0 indicates the initial concentration of alcohol, Calcohol and Caldehyde are to the concentration of substrate alcohol and corresponding aldehyde, respectively."
7,Control photoactivity experiments,"2.6 Control photoactivity experiments Diverse radical scavengers including ammonium oxalate (AO, harvest photogenerated holes), tertbutyl alcohol (TBA, harvest hydroxyl radicals), potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, the scavenger for photoinduced electrons), and benzoquinone (BQ, harvest superoxide radical species) were added into the normal reaction condition to capture the reactive intermediate of the benzyl alcohol oxidation [32,38]."
8,The quantum yield (QY),"2.7 The quantum yield (QY) The QY was calculated according to the yield of benzaldhyde [8,31,39]. The detection condition was utilized a monochromatic 400 nm LED lamp (Shenzhen LAMPLIC Science Co. China) and the intensity of LED irradiation was 18.6 mW cm−2 (measured by Newport 66,902). The irradiation area was controlled at 2.25 cm2 and the reaction time was 1 h. The detailed calculation processes were shown below. QY = Ne /Np = 2MNAhc/SPtλ In the equation, Ne was the amount of reaction electrons, Np was the amount of incident photons, M was the amount of benzaldhyde, NA was Avogadro’s constant, h was the Planck constant, c was the speed of light, S was the irradiation area, P was the intensity of the irradiation, t was the photoreaction time, and λ was the wavelength of the monochromatic light."
9,Results and discussion,"Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) tests are first conducted to investigate the structure and surface properties of the as-synthesized BCN materials. As displayed in Fig. 1 a, two characteristic XRD peaks are observed at 2θ of 26 and 43°, which are correspondingly assigned to the (002) and (100) planes of BCN [8,25–32]. Compared with the parental BCN, BCN-600 shows obviously enhanced XRD peak intensity, suggesting its high crystallinity. These results also indicate that the defects in BCN decrease obviously after the hydrogen reduction treatment. FTIR spectra of BCN and BCN-600 are shown in Fig. 1b. The two bands at 1380 and 780 cm−1 belong to the in-plan B–N transverse stretching vibration and the out-of-plan B–NB bending vibration, respectively, [8,25–32]. The band of CO vibrations locates at around 1190 cm−1 and the band of sp2 CN bonds is at 1623 cm−1 [8,25–32]. These findings suggest that the main chemical structure of BCN-600 is almost identical to that of pristine BCN. Nevertheless, the OH-groups of BCN-600 at ca. 3400 cm−1 decrease evidently in comparison to BCN, which reflects its low defect density, consistent with the XRD results [35,41–43]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples are shown in Fig. 1c. The materials exhibit a type I behavior and give an almost horizontal plateau under the relatively low pressures, indicating the presence of microporous. BCN-600 possesses a smaller surface area compared to unmodified BCN, implying the increased structural order and decreased defects of the former. The pore size distribution plots display the two samples retain a predominant pore diameter of 1∼5 nm (Fig. 1d). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations are performed to analyze the chemical compositions and coordinative states of the samples. The survey XPS spectrum reveals the characteristic B, C, N and O peaks in the samples (Fig. 2 a) [25–29,32,43,44]. As can been seen, the O content of BCN-600 decreases largely compared to that of BCN. The results of Elemental analysis (EA, Table S1) manifest the percentage of O reduce from 18.77 wt. % for BCN to 12.74 wt. % for BCN-600, which is in line with XPS data. The decreased O content also implies the decreased density of defects in BCN-600. In the high resolution XPS spectrum of B 1 s (Fig. 2b), the peaks with binding energies of 189.8, 190.4 and 192.0 eV correspond to the B–C, B–N and B–O bonds [25–29,32,43,44]. The C 1s XSP spectra are divided into four peaks at 283.5, 284.6, 285.6 and 286.6 eV, separately. The main peak at 284.6 eV is the carbon domain. The other three peaks are indexed to the CB (283.5 eV), CN (285.6 eV) and CO (286.6 eV) bonds, respectively [25–29,32,43,44]. Fig. 2d shows the high resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s, in which the binding energies of NB, NC and NH bonds are at 397.9, 398.6 and 400.5 eV, respectively [25–29,32,42,43]. Fig. 2e depicts the curve-resolved O 1s signal of BCN and BCN-600. The peaks at 531.5 and 532.4 eV are assigned to the surface OH species the OC bond, separately, another peak at 533.3 eV represents the surface absorbed H2O [43,45]. The light-response characters of the BCN and BCN-600 samples are measured by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the two materials show characteristic optical absorption of semiconductors [25–29,32,43,44]. The light absorption edge of BCN-600 is obviously extended toward visible-light range. The increased optical harvesting will provide more chance to capture the photons and improve photoredox catalysis [46–49]. The band structures of BCN and BCN-600 are studied. Based on the absorption edges (Fig. 3b), the bandgap energies of BCN and BCN-600 are 2.64 and 2.32 eV, respectively [25,29,32]. From the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 3c, d), the derived flat-band potentials of BCN and BCN-600 are determined to be of -0.56 and -0.68 V, which indicates BCN-600 has higher potential for superoxide radical (O2 −) evolution than pristine BCN semiconductor [3]. Based on these results, the band structures of the materials are illustrated (Fig. S1). The morphology of the BCN-600 material is studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The low magnification TEM image shows that BCN-600 possesses the nanosized sheet-like structure [25,32]. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image indicates the high crystallinity of the BCN-600 nanosheets with the interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, which is indexed to the (002) plane of BCN-600 (Fig. 4 b) [25–32]. The elemental composition and distribution of BCN-600 is demonstrated by the elemental mapping images (Fig. 4c), which indicate that the B, C, N and O elements are uniformly distributed in the BCN-600 nanosheet. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum further confirms the elemental composition of BCN (Fig. S2). To gather more insight into the charge separation and transfer process of the BCN and BCN-600 samples, the photo/electrochemical experiments are operated. The transient photocurrent formation of BCN-600 is obviously improved relative to BCN (Fig. 5 a), implying the fast transportation of photoinduced electrons [25–32,50,51]. Photoluminescence (PL) tests are conducted to further reveal the separation and transport properties of photoexcited charges in BCN and BCN-600. A strong and broad PL peak is detected for BCN at room temperature (Fig. 5b), indicating the high recombination rate of electron-hole pairs in the material [25–32,52]. In comparison, an obvious PL quenching is observed for BCN-600, which signifies the remarkable suppression of radiative charge recombination. Time-resolved PL spectra of BCN and BCN-600 are also collected to detect the decay kinetic of photoexcited charges. As shown in Fig. 5c, the average charge lifetime of BCN-600 is 4.01 ns, which is longer than that of the pristine BCN sample (3.53 ns). The prolonged charge lifetime suggests that the photoinduced charges of BCN-600 have more chances to participate the redox reactions [25–29]. Furthermore, the transfer of photoexcited charges is also explored by EIS (Fig. 5d). A significantly decreased diameter of the Nyquist plot of BCN-600 is observed, which points to the reduced charge transportation resistance [21,52–54]. All these results indicate the enhanced separation and mobility of photo-stimulated charges of BCN-600 under light excitation, which will endow the material an improved performance for photocatalytic redox reactions. To probe the ability of BCN-600 for activating the molecular O2, O2-TPD measurements are carried out. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the pristine BCN sample gives a clear peak located at 152 °C, attributing to the desorption of chemisorbed and/or strong physisorbed O2 [20,54]. This phenomenon is also observed for the BCN-600 sample. On the other hand, the desorption peaks correspond to the strong chemisorbed O2 are observed at the higher temperatures [20,54], that is 377 °C for BCN-600 and 365 °C for BCN. Noteworthy, a higher O2 desorption temperature of BCN-600 reflects the existence of a stronger interaction between BCN-600 and O2, which suggests a lower O2 activation barrier of the material. Such observations indicate that BCN-600 may more favorable for the activation of O2 molecules into reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as O2 − and hydroxyl radicals ( OH) for organic photosynthesis. The EPR characterizations are conducted to monitor the formation of O2 − by the typical DMPO capture method. As presented in Fig. 6b, in the presence of DMPO, the characteristic EPR signals of O2 − are observed for both BCN and BCN-600, evidencing the generation of O2 − upon photoexcitation of BCN in the system [21,54]. Apparently, the BCN-600 material manifests much strong EPR response than the paternal BCN counterpart under light irradiation, illustrating the enhanced production of O2 − over BCN-600. No EPR signals are detected in dark (Fig. S3), suggesting the generation of the O2 - species is induced by light excitation. In addition, on matter under light irradiation or in dark, no EPR signals assigned to the DMPO- OH adduct are detected (Fig. S4a–b), excluding the formation of hydroxyl radical ( OH) in the system. These EPR results demonstrate that superoxide radicals (O2 −) is the main ROS responsible for the photocatalytic oxidation catalysis by the BCN material, which is further supported by the ROS capture tests by adding the typical scavengers (Fig. S5). The interaction between in BA, BZH and the BCN catalyst is examined by the absorption of the organic molecules. As shown in Fig. 6c, BCN-600 exhibits much higher BA adsorption and lower BZH adsorption capacities than those of BCN. The previous works have demonstrated that the ordered structure favors BZH desorption due to less defects, which improving the selectivity and yield of BZH [20]. The enhanced BA adsorption and reduced BZH adsorption capacities of BCN-600 suggest that the mass transfer process should be facilitated, which can promote the conversion and selectivity of BA to BZH. Based on the above characterizations and discussions, it is revealed that hydrogen reduction modification is an efficient strategy to modulate the texture and photoelectronic properties of the BCN material, permitting the better performance for photoredox reactions. The selective BA oxidation performance of the BCN-600 photocatalyst is thereafter evaluated by irradiation of 400 nm LED light. As shown in Fig. 6d, the BCN-600 enables the oxidation of BA with a greatly improved performance in comparison to that of BCN after photoreaction for 4 h. The conversion of the BCN-600 sample reaches 82.7 % with a selectivity of 96.2 %, respectively, which evidently outperforms the BCN sample with 37.6 % conversion and 86.2 % selectivity. The QY of BCN-600 for the reaction is determined to be 3.6 % at monochromatic irradiation of 400 nm [8,32,40]. Meanwhile, the BCN-600 sample can also selectively oxidize many other aromatic alcohols with high conversion and superior selectivity (Fig. 6e). Specifically, the substituents of electron-donating groups (e.g., R = OCH3, CH3) promote the formation of the corresponding aldehydes; while the substituents of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., RF, NO2) hinder the conversion reaction. The control experiments indicate that the temperature of the hydrogen reduction treatment largely influence the performance of the final BCN catalyst (Figs. 6d and S6−8). The efficiencies of the blank experiments (e.g., no catalyst or in dark or in vacuum/N2) are significantly decreased, suggesting the solar-induced nature of the reaction mediated by oxygen (Fig. S9) [20,32,54]. The cycling experiments are carried out to check the stability of the BCN-600 material (Fig. 6f) [20,32,55–58]. No apparent loss in the catalytic performance of BCN-600 is observed during the five repeated operations of the reaction. Furthermore, the XRD and FTIR tests for the used samples show that no obvious changes in crystal and chemical structures of BCN-600 are detected after the photoredox reaction (Fig. S10a–b). The wavelength dependence of the BCN-600 for photocatalytic BA oxidation are investigated (Fig. S11), and the results suggest that performance of the photocatalyst is powerfully rely on the wavelength of the incident light. The time-online study displays a noticeable augment in the reaction conversion (Fig. S12), but a slight reduction in BZH selectivity, which may be induced by over-oxidation of BZH after long-time reaction [32]."
10,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have presented a facile and efficient method to rationally regulate the structure and surface properties of the BCN semiconductors by hydrogen reduction treatment. The strengthened structure and surface properties of the modulated BCN materials favor the rapid separation and transportation of photoexcited charges as well as the activation of molecular O2. As a result, the modified BCN photocatalyst exhibits greatly enhanced performance for the transformation of alcohols to the aldehydes with high conversion and selectivity. The current work has highlighted the importance of delicate structural engineering in promoting charge separation/migration kinetics and O2 activation, which may motivate new opportunities of heterogeneous photocatalysis for selective organic synthesis with solar energy."
