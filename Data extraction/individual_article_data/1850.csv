0,Introduction,"Food waste (FW) is generated in agricultural production and post-harvest practices, food storage and distribution, industrial processing and household consumption. Around one-third of the total food produced to feed humans ends up as FW, accounting for ~1.3 billion tons per year (Schanes et al., 2018). The current FW generation in Hong Kong, Australia and India are about 0.0003, 0.0008 and 0.05 billion tons per year, respectively (Heller et al., 2018; Nandan et al., 2017). The projected amount of FW in Asian countries in the next 25 years is ~0.416 billion tonnes (FAO, 2017; Stone et al., 2020). On the other hand, economic growth, changing production and consumption patterns resulted in the high usage of plastics for packaging, clothing, beverage, trash containers and numerous other commercial and household commodities necessitated a rapid increase in plastic production and caused subsequent plastic waste generation. The estimated global municipal plastic waste generation for 2015 is 55–82 billion tons and a three-fold increase in municipal plastic is predicted for the year 2060 (Lebreton and Andrady, 2019). About 60 % of the total plastic production is consumed by household usage, for wrapping and packing, out of which ~70 % of plastics end up in municipal solid waste (MSW). FW disposal in open dumps or non-engineered land fill results in air, water and soil pollution. Biological treatment processes like composting and anaerobic digestion are time-consuming and thus, pose difficulty in handling the daily waste generated in large quantities (Elkhalifa et al., 2019). Conversely, plastic disposal is a tremendous problem due to its non-biodegradability and low reactivity (Hamad et al., 2014). Though a small amount of plastic waste is being recovered or recycled, most plastic waste is disposed of in oceans or landfills (Ryan et al., 2009). Waste-to-energy (WtE) technique is an attractive alternative for solid waste management. In the past few decades, the WtE technique through bioprocessing and thermochemical conversion has gained importance as an alternative energy source due to the depleting fossil fuel reserves (Idris et al., 2020). Thermochemical conversion techniques like combustion, incineration and pyrolysis are beneficial for producing valuable end products and substantial MSW volume reduction (Hamad et al., 2014). The emission of harmful gases such as dioxins and furans is the major bottleneck in the combustion and incineration of MSW (Fernández-González et al., 2017). Conversely, pyrolysis for solid waste management has received attention in recent years due to its effectiveness, reliability and eco-friendly operation. Pyrolysis results in the cracking of feed in an inert atmosphere and at a temperature of 400–700 °C with/without catalyst (Abdelsayed et al., 2019). Pyrolysis can achieve a volume reduction of solid waste up to 88 % by tuning operating parameters along with the production of useful end products such as solid (biochar), liquid (bio-oil) and gaseous (pygas) (Rajasekhar et al., 2015). Among the end products, bio-oil is gaining more attention as a potential liquid fuel and source of raw chemicals in the last few decades because of its renewability, high energy density and easy transportability (Hu and Gholizadeh, 2019). However, the main disadvantages of conventional pyrolysis with the electrical heating system include high energy losses due to low thermal transfer efficiency, slow heating rate, long processing time, undesirable heating of the pyrolysis chamber and poor control in the heating process because of uneven heat distribution (Shukla et al., 2019) Therefore, numerous researchers investigated microwave (MW) pyrolysis over conventional pyrolysis (Bushra and Remya, 2020; Miura et al., 2004; Sahoo and Remya, 2020; Shukla et al., 2019; Suriapparao and Vinu, 2015; Yu et al., 2020) Selective and rapid heating of feed at the molecular level, ease in control, high energy efficiency and peculiar energy transfer mechanism of MW improved MW-based treatment techniques (Remya and Lin, 2015). The high moisture content (~70%) of FW increases the presence of oxygenated compounds in pyrolyzed bio-oil with subsequent reduction in the higher heating value (HHV) along with an increase in the total acid number (TAN) (Adhikari et al., 2018). Whereas, bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis/MW pyrolysis of hydrogen-rich material such as waste tire, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) etc., possess less oxygenated compounds and thus provide high HHV (Ahmad et al., 2015; Artetxe et al., 2012; Czajczyńska et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2016). The household practice of FW collection and disposal in LDPE bags necessitates FW segregation from LDPE before the waste management practices. Conversely, co-pyrolysis is a better option to eliminate segregation and improve bio-oil quality (Fermanelli et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2016). MW co-pyrolysis of different biomass such as wood chips, bamboo sticks, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, straw, sawmill and paper mill discards along with tire, PP, PS, LDPE, HDPE etc. was performed by several researchers (Fermanelli et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2016; Supramono and Lusiani, 2016; Suriapparao et al., 2018). MW co-pyrolysis of FW was also performed on model kitchen waste such as potato peel, coffee hull, soybean protein, corn cups, almond shells, nutshells, waste cereals, waste peanuts crisps etc. (Jamradloedluk and Lertsatitthanakorn, 2015; Jia et al., 2016; Sajdak and Muzyka, 2014). However, bio-oil production from MW co-pyrolysis of heterogeneous FW and LDPE and the optimization of operating parameters for TAN, a significant bio-oil quality, was not reported in previous studies. Therefore, multifactor optimization of operating parameters using central composite design was performed in this study, emphasizing the recovery of high bio-oil yield with low TAN. Besides, the characterization of bio-oil was performed to evaluate its quality for subsequent use. The interaction mechanism of FW and LDPE hydrocarbons for bio-oil quality improvement was also proposed, along with the energy consumption analysis of the process."
1,Material and methods,
2,Feed composition and pre-treatment,"2.1 Feed composition and pre-treatment The feed used in this study comprised FW and LDPE. The composition of FW collected from a residential area is listed in Table S1, whereas the plastic bag used for FW collection was used as LDPE. The FW and LDPE were characterized for their proximate and elemental analysis. Subsequently, the FW was dried in a hot air oven to reduce the moisture content (<7%) to (i) reduce MW energy consumption for excess moisture removal during co-pyrolysis, (ii) for ease in feed grinding and (iii) to eliminate the high moisture content in bio-oil. Further, the size reduction of FW and LDPE was made separately up to 5 mm. According to the experimental design, different FW and LDPE ratio was used as feed in MW co-pyrolysis experimental runs. As LDPE is a non-MW absorber and FW is a poor MW absorber, 6 wt% of granular activated carbon (GAC) was added to the feed to improve MW absorbance and heating rate."
3,MW co-pyrolysis reactor,"2.2 MW co-pyrolysis reactor MW co-pyrolysis of feed was performed in a customized MW reactor (Ragatech, Pune, India), mentioned in our previous study (Shukla et al., 2019), with a maximum output power of 1000 W and operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz (Fig. 1 ). The reactor has control over MW power, temperature, reaction time, etc. The temperature of the feed was measured with a non-contact infra-red thermocouple. The feed was pyrolyzed in a quartz vessel with a capacity of 0.002 m3placed inside the MW reaction chamber. Quartz vessel was connected to a condenser (having a temperature of 5 °C) and a collection unit with an outlet pipe to facilitate condensation and bio-oil collection. Furthermore, one collection unit was also provided to capture the pygas."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The MW co-pyrolysis was conducted with grounded and thoroughly mixed feed. Prior to the MW co-pyrolysis process, nitrogen gas was purged for 20 min at the rate of 1 L/min to create the inert atmosphere. During the co-pyrolysis process, the nitrogen gas flow was kept at 0.25 L/min. Initially, few experimental trials were performed without GAC addition. Poor MW absorbance capacity of FW and LDPE led to high consumption of time and MW power. As a result, a slow heating rate was observed and even after 30 min of heating time, desirable temperature (400–700 °C) was not achieved. Hence, all the other experimental runs for optimization were conducted with GAC, where the desired temperature was achieved within 15 min. 50 g of the feed having different FW-LDPE ratios and GAC was taken in the quartz vessel inside the MW chamber and pyrolyzed at a temperature range of 400–700 °C. After reaching the desired temperature, residence time of 3–10 s was provided based on the previous literature, showing maximum bio-oil yield within 0.5–10 s (Jia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Subsequently, bio-oil and biochar were weighed and expressed as weight percentage to that of feed, whereas pygas was calculated by mass balance method. Dichloromethane was used as a solvent to extract all the condensate from the condenser and other connecting walls and tubes."
5,Optimization of operating parameters through response surface methodology,"2.4 Optimization of operating parameters through response surface methodology Optimization of operating parameters was performed by central composite design (CCD) using response surface methodology (RSM) (Remya and Lin, 2017). Firstly, the experimental design was framed with the statistical design of experiments by CCD; secondly, estimation of regression coefficients with the help of mathematical models was done, followed by the prediction of responses and the model validation. The experiments were conducted with three operating parameters (independent variables), namely residence time (RT), LDPE in feed (P) and temperature (T), to predict the responses in terms of bio-oil yield ( wt%) and TAN (mg KOH/g). Operating parameters were set at five levels (0, ±1 and ± α), with the higher and lower levels selected based on previous study (Liu et al., 2014). Table S2 enlists the coded and actual values of operating parameters. The experimental design consisted of six-star points (±α), eight factorial points (±1) and three centre points (0), resulting in 17 sets of experimental runs. The triplication of centre point run (0,0,0) ensured the rotatability and adequate precision (Rakić et al., 2014). Bio-oil yield and TAN were determined for each experimental run. Combined contour and 3D response surface plots of the experimental results have been plotted according to the experimental conditions to identify the dependency of the operating parameters on the bio-oil yield and TAN. Subsequently, a regression analysis was conducted to develop a second-order polynomial model to describe the experimental results. Model terms were chosen based on the p values at a 95 % confidence level. The results were thoroughly analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) by Design-Expert software (version 7), which includes the experimental design, data analysis and the quadratic model formulation. The three independent variables, RT, P and T, were related to the quadratic polynomial response model as per equation (1). (1) Y = K + X 1 R T + X 2 P + X 3 T + X 12 R T P + X 13 R T T + X 23 P T + X 11 R T 2 + X 22 P 2 + X 33 T 2 where Y is the predicted response, K and Xi are the regression coefficient, in which K is the constant, X1, X2, X3 are the linear coefficients, X12, X13, X23 are the cross-product coefficients and X11, X22, X33 is the quadratic coefficients. Further, to get corrected response, Yc the polynomial quadratic response obtained from the model (Y) was validated by performing three sets of random experiments and comparing the predicted values of dependent variables obtained from the model to that of the experimental outcomes (equation (2)). (2) Y c = Y + ε where ε is the random error."
6,Analysis of feed and bio-oil,"2.5 Analysis of feed and bio-oil Moisture content, volatile matter content, ash content and fixed carbon of the FW and LDPE were determined by proximate analysis (APHA, 2012). The ultimate analysis was carried out using an Elemental analyzer (Euro Vector EA3000) to determine the carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) content of FW and LDPE. HHV was determined using bomb calorimeter (Rajdhani Co. Ltd, New Delhi, India, Model RSB-5). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was done with TGA Q50 V20.13 Build 39 under a nitrogen atmosphere to investigate the thermal stability of feed. Bio-oil was analyzed for pH (pH meter, Adel model), TAN (ASTM D664) and HHV. The condensed hydrocarbons present in bio-oil were identified with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent 7890, 5975C). The analysis was carried out using HP-5MS capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 mm id × 0.25 μm film thickness) with ultra-high pure helium (99.9995 %) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min as the carrier gas. 0.2 μL of bio-oil was injected for the analysis. Following conditions were maintained during the analysis: initially, the oven temperature was maintained at 45 °C for 1 min, followed by a ramp at the rate of 5 °C/min to 240 °C, then the same temperature was kept constant for 15 min to allow the elution of all the compounds present in bio-oil. The MS ion source temperature and detector temperature has been adjusted to 275 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The scanned mass range was 35–450 Da and the electron ionization voltage was 70 eV. The split ratio of the injector was kept as 10:1. Organics compounds in bio-oil were identified by comparing the mass spectra corresponding to every peak with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library. Compounds with a match factor >85 % were grouped into different chemical categories."
7,Energy consumption analysis,"2.6 Energy consumption analysis The energy consumption analysis of MW co-pyrolysis process was done in terms of energy consumption to pyrolyze unit kg of feed and to produce unit kg of bio-oil (equations (3)–(7)). (3) E C D = P D × t D W f e e d (4) E C G = P G × t G W f e e d (5) E C P = P P × t P W f e e d (6) E C o v e r a l l = E C D + E C G + E C P (7) E C b i o − o i l = E C o v e r a l l Y b i o − o i l where, ECD, ECG and ECP are the energy consumed by the instruments used for drying, grinding and pyrolysis, respectively. PD, PG and PP are the respective representation of power input (kW) of instruments used for drying, grinding and pyrolysis. tD, tG, tP are the time (h) taken to dry, grind and pyrolyze the feed, respectively; whereas, Wfeed is the feed weight (kg). ECoverall and ECbio-oil represent overall energy consumption and energy consumption required to produce a unit kg of bio-oil. Ybio-oil represents the bio-oil yield (%)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characteristics of FW and LDPE,"3.1 Characteristics of FW and LDPE 3.1.1 Proximate, ultimate and energy content analysis The proximate, ultimate and energy content analysis of FW and LDPE is listed in Table 1 . Further, proximate analysis parameters are given as a ternary plot (Fig. S1). Both FW and LDPE exhibited high volatile matter content of 87 % and 89 %, respectively. Conversely, the FW showed low ash content (2 %) compared to LDPE (10.2 %). Carbon content of FW and LDPE was 41.17 % and 69.71 %, respectively. Whereas the respective value of hydrogen content for the same was 6.24 % and 10.67 %. Oxygen content in FW (49.52 %) was high compared to that of LDPE (~19 %). HHV of FW and LDPE was 13,167 kJ/kg and 32,646 kJ/kg, respectively. 3.1.2 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The weight loss of FW and LDPE with an increase in temperature is represented as a TGA plot; while the derivative of weight change with temperature, which indicates the activation of the thermochemical reaction, is shown as a derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve (Fig. 2 (a) and (b)). About 7 % of weight reduction in FW was observed within 110 °C, indicating moisture removal. Further, ~67 % reduction in weight was observed up to 350 °C of temperature, due to the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose between the temperature range of 200 °C–350 °C, with the highest DTG peak at 300 °C (Fig. 2 (a) (Jo et al., 2017). On the other hand, the slow decomposition of LDPE was observed up to 350 °C and the sudden release of volatiles was observed thereafter up to 550 °C (Fig. 2 (b)). This could be due to the release of small aliphatic chains in LDPE by random scission of the main chain (Dümichen et al., 2015). The weight reduction beyond 550 °C was due to thermal degradation and the formation of fixed carbon (Table S3)."
10,Interactive effect of operating parameters on the bio-oil yield and TAN,"3.2 Interactive effect of operating parameters on the bio-oil yield and TAN 3.2.1 Bio-oil yield Bio-oil yield varied from 17 to 42 % in various experimental runs (Table 2 ). At 550 °C temperature and 7 s residence time, MW pyrolysis of FW resulted in a bio-oil yield of 35 wt%. Under the same temperature and residence time, addition of 13 % LDPE in feed improved the bio-oil yield to 42 wt% (run 6–8, Table 2). This positive synergetic effect on bio-oil yield could be due to volatile generation via thermal breakdown of FW and LDPE. Previous studies also reported a positive synergetic effect on bio-oil yield with co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic (Fermanelli et al., 2020; Suriapparao et al., 2018). Fig. 3 (a–c) represents the effect of various operating parameters (residence time, LDPE in feed and temperature) on bio-oil yield. Fig. 3 (a) illustrates the 3D response surface and contour plots for the combined effect of temperature and LDPE in feed at a constant residence time of 7 s. The figure shows that the bio-oil yield increased from 17 wt% at 400 °C, reached a maximum (42 wt%) and decreased thereafter. The increase in bio-oil yield up to 595 °C was due to thermal decomposition of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids present in feed (in the form of volatile matter content) (J. Chen et al., 2019; Rajasekhar et al., 2015). Thereafter, with an increase in temperature, a decrease in bio-oil yield was observed due to secondary cracking of volatiles (Huang et al., 2008). Conversely, within the experimental boundaries of operating parameters, at a fixed temperature of 550 °C, residence time of 6–8 s and LDPE in feed <13 % resulted in the highest bio-oil yield of 42 wt% (Fig. 3 (b)). This could be due to the simultaneous breakdown of strong organic bonds of FW followed by its volatilization and depolymerization of LDPE, which increased the bio-oil yield (Zhang et al., 2018). Further increase of LDPE in the feed and residence time decreased the bio-oil yield up to ~30 wt% due to low MW absorption and increased volatilization caused by high LDPE in the feed and high residence time, respectively. An increase in bio-oil yield was reported with ~14 wt% addition of plastic to pinewood sawdust (Uzoejinwa et al., 2018). Moreover, increasing the residence time (7 s) and temperature (550 °C) also resulted in the maximum bio-oil yield of 42 wt%. Further, increase in the residence time and temperature beyond the optimal value decreased the bio-oil yield, which could have been due to the initiation of repolymerization reaction of feed (Fig. 3 (c)) (Das and Goud, 2021). Fig. 4 illustrates the relative yield of bio-oil, biochar and pygas from MW co-pyrolysis of FW and LDPE. Bio-oil yield decreased with >13 % LDPE in feed with the significant increase in biochar and pygas (Fig. 4 (a)). Conversely, temperature >550 °C showed a decrease in biochar yield with a corresponding increase in pygas yield (Fig. 4 (b)). A similar effect on biochar and pygas yield was observed with increased residence time (>8s) (Fig. 4 (c)). Thus, under optimized condition, along with 42 wt% of bio-oil yield was obtained along with biochar (42 wt%) and pygas (16 wt%) with SOx and NOx content below detectable limit. 3.2.2 TAN TAN of bio-oil varied from 16 to 45 mg KOH/g in various experimental runs. In run 1 (FW alone), 45 mg KOH/g of TAN was observed. LDPE addition in feed caused a significant decrease in the TAN of bio-oil (16 mg KOH/g, run 6–8). Increase in residence time and LDPE in feed reduced the TAN of bio-oil (Fig. 5 (a)). Breakdown of LDPE hydrocarbons promoted hydrogen transfer to saturate phenolic and carboxylic compounds present on bio-oil (Oasmaa et al., 2010), which decreased the TAN (16 mg KOH/g). However, LDPE in feed >13 % and residence time >8 s promoted the increase in TAN Secondary cracking of volatiles and generation of excess acidic, carboxylic and phenolic compounds contributed to higher TAN at temperature >595 °C (Fig. 5 (b)) (Oh et al., 2017). On the other hand, 470–580 °C of temperature and 4–7 s of residence time resulted in low TAN of bio-oil (Fig. 5 (c)). The decrease in TAN was achieved by the synergetic effect of non-oxygenated and oxygenated compounds generated from LDPE and FW (Supramono and Lusiani, 2016). Overall, minimum TAN of bio-oil (16 mg KOH/g) was achieved at 550 °C of temperature, 7 s residence time and 13 % LDPE in feed."
11,Statistical analysis of the experimental outcomes,"3.3 Statistical analysis of the experimental outcomes Regression analysis was performed using analysis of variance to determine the significance of each independent variable and its interactions in bio-oil yield and TAN (Table 3 ). After the regression analysis, a second-order polynomial model was obtained for predicting the response (bio-oil yield and TAN) in terms of residence time, RT (s), LDPE in feed, P (%) and temperature, T (°C). For the bio-oil yield and TAN model, F-value was higher than F0.05, rejecting the null hypothesis. Also, the coefficient of variation (C.V.) < 10 % for bio-oil yield and TAN (6.93 % and 8.8 %, respectively) indicated low variation from the mean value and reproducibility of the model (Reed et al., 2002). Adequate precision represents the signal to noise ratio. It compares the range of the predicted values at the design points to the average prediction error. A ratio greater than 4 indicates adequate model discrimination. In the present study, adequate precision is > 4 (16.05 for bio-oil yield and 8.8 for TAN), which satisfied the model significance. Therefore, generated models can be used to navigate the design space. The correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.97 and 0.89 for bio-oil yield and TAN, respectively. The respective adjusted R2 of 0.94 and 0.81 are in reasonable agreement with the necessary condition, i.e., adjusted R2 = ± 0.2 R2 (Frost, 2014). The linear term P (F −70.04, p- <0.0001) and T (F −12.86, p- <0.008), interaction term RTP (F −12.13, p- <0.010) and all the quadratic terms (P2 – F −12.69, p- <0.0092, RT 2 - F −70.04, p- <0.0001 and T2 - F −137.35, p- <0.0001) are significant factors for bio-oil yield. The TAN is influenced by linear term P (F – 6.00, p - <0.0441) and all the quadratic terms (P2 – F −34.05, p- <0.006, RT 2 - F −10.77, p- <0.0135 and T2 - F −22.77, p- <0.002). Thus, the second-order polynomial model for predicting bio-oil yield and TAN within experimental boundaries is given in equation (8) and equation (9), respectively. (8) B i o − o i l y i e l d ( % ) = − 310 + 200 P − 0.11 T − 15 R T P − 1.22 R T 2 − 3.08 P 2 − 0.0008 T 2 (9) T A N ( m g K O H / g ) = 320 − 7.2 P + 1.03 R T 2 − 0.10 P 2 − 0.0008 T 2"
12,Model validation,"3.4 Model validation A good correlation was obtained between the observed and predicted value of bio-oil yield and TAN (Fig S2 (a-b)), with R2 of 0.97 and 0.89, respectively. Bio-oil yield and TAN followed a straight line (Fig S3 (a-b)), implicating the normal dispersion of the error (Frost, 2014). Besides, the identification of outliers with externally studentized residuals (Fig S4 (a-b)) showed residuals within the acceptable range (±4.82 value of outliers). Further, to check the applicability of the obtained model in bio-oil yield and TAN prediction, three random sets of experiments within the experimental range were performed. The obtained experimental outcomes are compared to that of the predicted outcomes using equation (8) and equation (9). The polynomial model could predict the bio-oil yield and TAN with 4.8–7.1% and 6.3–8.1% of error, respectively (Table 4 )."
13,Detailed analysis of bio-oil quality and mechanism of bio-oil generation,"3.5 Detailed analysis of bio-oil quality and mechanism of bio-oil generation MW co-pyrolysis of FW and LDPE indicated higher bio-oil yield (42 %) compared to the bio-oil yield from MW pyrolysis of FW with/without MW absorbers or catalysts (Table 5 ). The pH of bio-oil obtained from MW co-pyrolysis was comparable with that of MW catalytic pyrolysis of FW. High moisture content of bio-oil obtained from MW pyrolysis of FW (~35%) was observed due to the hydration and reaction between hydrogen and oxygen molecule (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2015). Conversely, 44 % increase in HHV was observed in MW co-pyrolysis of FW and LDPE compared to that of MW pyrolysis of FW alone (Table 5) due to the synergetic effect of volatile matter present in FW and LDPE (Arshad et al., 2017; Himmel et al., 2007; Salman et al., 2019). The high availability of carbon and hydrogen in LDPE was responsible for improving bio-oil yield and HHV. A similar result was obtained in co-pyrolysis of FW and wood bark, which showed four times improvement in HHV of bio-oil compared to bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis of FW alone (Park et al., 2020). Chemical compounds present in bio-oil, obtained under the optimized condition, were determined using GC-MS analysis (Fig. S5). Major identified compounds with their wt % in bio-oil are shown in Fig. 6 . The bio-oil from MW pyrolysis of FW composed of acids (1.78 wt%), furans (1.73 wt%), alcohols (1.43 wt%), phenolic compounds (1.15 wt%) and alkanes (1.10 wt%). Addition of LDPE reduced the presence of acid and alcohol (by 40 %), furans (by 66 %), phenols (by 50 %) and enhanced the presence of alkanes (by 48 %), ketones and sugars in the resulted bio-oil (Fig. 6). Proposed reaction mechanism of bio-oil production from MW pyrolysis of FW and MW co-pyrolysis of FW and LDPE is presented in Fig. 7 . MW pyrolysis of FW resulted in the thermal breakdown of cellulose, glucose, starch and hemicellulose present in FW into smaller hydrocarbon chain followed by their subsequent volatilization, decarboxylation and depolymerization (Route 1) and produced Galloyl alcohol, 3-furfuryl alcohol, Citric acid, 2,6 dimethylheptadecane and furfural in bio-oil (Fig. 7). Similar compounds were observed in bio-oil from MW pyrolysis of agricultural waste and FW (Okaru and Lachenmeier, 2017; Chen et al., 2019b). During MW co-pyrolysis, thermal breakdown of LDPE resulted in the generation of highly reactive and unstable free radicals such as hydrocarbon radical (•HC) and hydrogen radical (•H). These free radicals propagated the breaking of large hydrocarbon chains of FW (obtained from route 1) into a smaller chain of hydrocarbons (Route 2). The random chain scission and structural breakdown of Galloyl alcohol, 3-furfuryl alcohol, Citric acid and 2,6 dimethylheptadecane were converted to Resorcinol, Levulinic acid, 1-Hexanoic acid and 2-Hexene respectively. Moreover, the addition of LDPE with FW generated ketones and sugar such as 3-Ethyl-1,2-cyclopentanedione and Arabinose, respectively, which could be due to the saturation of phenolic and carboxylic compounds via hydrogen transfer during FW and LDPE hydrocarbon interaction (Khaghanikavkani, 2013). Overall, bio-oil obtained from MW co-pyrolysis of FW and LDPE composed of 65 % oxygenated compounds and 35% non-oxygenated compounds. These oxygenated compounds were mainly obtained from carbohydrates present in FW such as cellulose, glucose, starch and hemicellulose (Oasmaa et al., 2010; Suriapparao et al., 2020). Several researchers reported that MW pyrolysis of FW alone resulted in oxygenated end products such as sugars, aldehydes, ketones, acids and phenols in bio-oil and thus low HHV, thermal instability and corrosive nature of bio-oil was observed (Brebu et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2018). Overall, the addition of LDPE with FW improved the bio-oil quality by lowering the concentrations of phenols, acids, aldehydes and ketones, which improved the bio-oil HHV from 9121.12 kJ/kg (FW) to 13,117 kJ/kg (FW-LDPE). Thus, bio-oil can be used in boilers, engines, turbines, transportation fuels and renewable feed for chemical synthesis."
14,Energy consumption analysis,"3.6 Energy consumption analysis Energy consumption analysis is an essential aspect of the pyrolysis process for its cost-effective application. Table 6 enlist MW pyrolysis of FW along with the energy consumption. Prior studies indicated higher energy consumption in FW drying (56.16–280.8 kWh/kg), resulting ECoverall of 58.66–290.17 kWh/kg (Kadlimatti et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2014; Suriapparao and Vinu, 2015). Whereas, less tD and corresponding low ED (1.4 kWh/kg) in the present study resulted in the ECoverall of 5.51 kWh/kg and ECbio-oil of 13.11 kWh/kg."
15,Conclusions,"This study investigated the possibility of microwave (MW) co-pyrolysis of food waste (FW) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to retrieve bio-oil. The addition of LDPE in feed resulted in 20 % increase in bio-oil yield compared to FW alone. Under optimized operating conditions (13% of LDPE in feed (P), 550 °C of temperature (T) and 7 s of residence time (RT)), 42 wt% of bio-oil yield was obtained with the low total acid number (TAN) of 16 mg KOH/g. The quadratic model was generated to predict the bio-oil yield and TAN with 4.8–7.1% and 6.3–8.1% of error. The bio-oil yield was mainly affected by linear terms of P and T, interactive effect of RT and P and square terms of all the operating parameters. Whereas, linear term of P and the square terms of RT, P and T affected the TAN of bio-oil. Addition of LDPE decreased the moisture content (30 %) and TAN (~62 %) of bio-oil, along with the significant enhancement in pH (40 %) and HHV (~44 %). The proposed mechanism for enhanced bio-oil quality is the synergetic effect of FW hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon radical (•HC) and hydrogen radical (•H) of LDPE. As a result, the saturation of phenolic and carboxylic compounds led to a significant reduction in phenols, alcohols, acids and furan compounds with the enhancement of useful alkanes and sugar compounds. Furthermore, energy consumption analysis of the process demonstrated the applicability of MW co-pyrolysis of FW and LDPE with an energy consumption of 13.11 kWh/kg of bio-oil."
