0,Introduction,"To date, abundant, low-cost and renewable lignocellulosic biomass has been utilized to replace conventional fossil resources for sustainable production of value-added biobased chemicals, biofuel molecules, and functional materials (Cai et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2019), which accelerates biomass utilization to meet the requirement of global energy transformation. Hemicellulose (25–35 wt%), Cellulose (30–50 wt%), and lignin (15–35 wt%) are three main lignocellulosic components (Peng et al., 2019; Riva et al., 2021). Hemicellulose is easy to be hydrolyzed with H+ into D-xylose followed by the dehydration to furfural (FAL) in acidic condition (Seretis et al., 2020). FAL is a versatile molecule, which is listed in the “Top10 + 4” compounds by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004 (Bozell & Petersen, 2010). It is a new type of renewable platform compound in production of detergents, biofuels, lubricant, polymers, perfumes, resins, food additives, and agrochemicals (Gong et al., 2019). FAL is also used for synthesis of furfuryl alcohol (FOL), furfurylamine (FLA), furoic acid (FA), etc. (Wang et al., 2020b). FOL, another kind of multi-functional furan-based chemical, has wide application prospects, such as adhesives, ascorbic acid, coatings, sealants, furan resins, and plasticizers, etc. (Halilu et al., 2016). Production of FAL and FOL from biomass has attracted the interest of researchers. Liquid- and gas-phase hydrogenation of FAL routes are main industrial production of FOL methods (Romano et al., 2016). However, high energy consumption and noble catalyst are required, accompanying with undesired byproducts. Recently, whole cell-catalyzed bioreduction of FAL to FOL has attracted much attentions due to its low energy consumption, high activity and high selectivity under the environmentally-friendly performance condition (Li et al., 2021a). Regeneration of coenzymes by coupling reductase with dehydrogenase is the most popular method in bioreduction processes (Peng et al., 2019). Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) can be used to couple coenzyme regeneration systems with reductases due to oxidation of glucose to produce gluconic acid with concomitant biotransformation of NAD(P)+ to yield NAD(P)H (Li et al., 2021b). However, the generated gluconic acid might change the pH value of reaction system and then affects the enzyme activity, thus a cumbersome pH adjustment is required, eventually making the process more complex and forming a large quantity of solid waste salt. The market price of glucose also poses an economic barrier to the application of bioreduction of FAL to FOL to industry. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is able to oxidize formate into generate CO2, and this process is accompanied by bioreduction of NAD(P)+ to yield NAD(P)H. CO2 is able to escape the reaction system. With the introduction of FDH for internal cofactor (NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H) regeneration and co expression with reductase and FDH in a microbe, it is much simpler and more controllable relative to GDH, which can operate without the need for pH adjustment during reaction progress. According to statistics, 60% of FAL is used to produce FOL (de Souza et al., 2019). Recently, the conversion of available inexpensive biomass into FAL has attracted widespread attention. Generally, FAL is prepared by hydrolysis of biomass with homogeneous inorganic acids (H3PO4, HCl, and H2SO4). However, the traditional hydrolysis process need the high loading of inorganic acids, which causes severe corrosion of equipment and environmental pollution (Shun et al., 2013). Very recently, the use of heterogeneous solid acids has gained much attention in recent years because of high catalytic activity, low corrosion, easy recovery, and good thermal stability (Li et al., 2021b). Using sulfonated perlite, sulfonated carbon nanotube, and aluminium-based alkaline-treated graphite, biomass have been successfully transformed to FAL (Li et al., 2021a). However, the preparation processes of solid acid catalysts are complicated and the raw materials are expensive, which represented an economic barrier for commercialization. Presently, a new type of ionic liquids, also known as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), have begun to find applications in the preparation of FAL from biomass (Morais et al., 2020). However, high loading of DESs are required, which are not easy to separate in the application process (Bystrzanowska & Tobiszewski, 2021; Liu et al., 2021b). Drawbacks of DESs in valorization of biomass into FAL can be addressed by loading low dosage of DESs onto the supports with large specific surface area. Silica synthesized by applying sol–gel process using TEOS as silica source has a large specific surface area and high thermal stability (Lestari & Helmiyati, 2020; Pan et al., 2020). TEOS is a common precursor of silica, which is non-toxic and less costly compared with other types of precursors. However, there is limited information about the effective utilization of deep eutectic solvents on the sol–gel derived silica catalyst and reductase biocatalyst using formic acid-driven coenzyme regeneration to chemoenzymatically catalyze FOL production from biomass in one-pot manner. Herein, DES-SiO2 solid acid catalysts, which were prepared in the way that DESs (e.g., DES ChCl:Lactic acid and Betaine:Lactic acid) were loaded on silica by the sol–gel method using TEOS as silica source in strong acid condition, were used for synthesizing FAL from corncob (CB). The properties of the catalyst were characterized with X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, Brunner-Emmett-Teller, and scanning electron microscope. The catalytic parameters on the production of FAL were evaluated. A catalytic mechanism was proposed for converting biomass into FAL with DES-SiO2 solid acid catalyst. To synthesize FOL from FAL, recombinant E. coli KF2021 cells harboring reductase and FDH were constructed, and bioreduction reaction factors were optimized with the aim to improve the FAL-reducing activity. Finally, CB was catalyzed into FOL were established by one-pot tandem transformation with a novel heterogeneous DES-SiO2 catalyst and newly constructed reductase biocatalyst in a developed DES-water system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials Corncob (CB) (34.1 wt% xylan, 17.0 wt% lignin and 29.7 wt% glucan) was collected from village of Jintan (Jiangsu Province, P.R. China). Choline chloride (ChCl), lactic acid (LA), betaine (B), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium formate (HCOONa), furfural (FAL), furfuryl alcohol (FOL), AlCl3, FeCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, MgCl2, CrCl3, ZnCl2, KCl, CaCl2, MnCl2 and other chemicals were bought from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, P.R. China)."
3,DESs-SiO2 preparation,"2.2 DESs-SiO2 preparation DESs was prepared by heating. HBA (ChCl or Betaine) and HBD (Lactic acid) were blended by stirring (200 rpm) at the specified HBA-to-HBD molar ratio in 500-mL round-bottomed flask at 80 ˚C for 3 h until uniform transparent solution was generated. The obtained DES ChCl:Lactic acid (ChCl:LA) or Betaine:Lactic acid (B:LA) was used as catalyst and solvent. The DESs-SiO2 catalysts were prepared in the way that DESs were loaded on silica by the sol–gel (SG) method using TEOS as silica source in strong acid condition. 100.0 g deionized water, DES B:LA, or DES ChCl:LA was supplemented into 1700 mL mixture containing 1000 mL TEOS and 700 mL anhydrous ethanol by sufficient stirring under a water bath condition at 60 ˚C, and this solution was denoted as solution A. 400 mL of concentrated HCl was mixed with 700 mL of deionized water by stirring, and this mixture was marked as solution B. Solution B was slowly dropped into solution A, and this mixture was fully stirred for 3 h at 60 ˚C and 300 rpm to form transparent gel solution, which was further placed in an oven at 70 ˚C for 24 h. Solid acid SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2), and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) catalyst were obtained by grinding."
4,DESs-SiO2-catalyzed the conversion of CB into FAL,"2.3 DESs-SiO2-catalyzed the conversion of CB into FAL 40 mL water, 2.0 g CB powder (50.0 g/L, 40–60 mesh) and solid acid catalyst (SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2), or ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2)) (0–5.0 wt%) were added into a reactor (100-mL) by stirring (500 rmp) at 160–180 ˚C for 10–50 min. After reaction, the samples were withdrawn for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis."
5,Construction of recombinant E. Coli KF2021 whole-cells harboring FDH,"2.4 Construction of recombinant E. Coli KF2021 whole-cells harboring FDH Enzyme genes of NAD(P)H-dependent reductase (CmCR) from Candida magnoliae (GenBank: AGJ03541.1) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii (GenBank: OWB83932.1) were ordered from GeneCreate Co., (Wuhan, P.R. China). pRSFDuet-1 backbone was linearized by primers pRSF-F (AGCCAGGATCCGAATTCGAG) and pRSF-R (GTGGTGATGATGGTGATGGCTG). CmCR was amplified by primers CmCR-F (GCCATCACCATCATCACCACATGGCTAAGAACTTCTCCAACGTCG) and CmCR-R (GATATATCTCCTTAGGTACCTTAGGGAAGCGTGTAGCCACC). Primers FDH-F (GGTACCTAAGGAGATATATCATGAAAATTGTTCTGGTTCTGTATGATGCAG) and FDH-R (CTCGAATTCGGATCCTGGCTTCATTTTTTGTCGTGTTTGCCATAGGC) amplified FDH. After the target gene CmCR and FDH were ligated and assembled, the assembled gene was inserted into the multiple cloning site 1 in pRSFDuet-1 following His-tag. Recombinant plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing after colony PCR. The plasmids were then electroporated into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) and obtained E. coli KF2021. Agarose gel electrophoresis assayed the formed gene of CmCR-FDH (1967 bp) (Fig. 1 a). The expression of CmCR (30.42 kDa) and FDH (40.27 kDa) were shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1b)."
6,KF2021 cell-catalyzed the bioreduction of commercial and CB-derived FAL into FOL,"2.5 KF2021 cell-catalyzed the bioreduction of commercial and CB-derived FAL into FOL Recombinant E. coli KF2021 was used for converting the commercial FAL or the biomass-derived FAL to FOL. Its cultivation and cell harvest were conducted as the previous report (Liao et al., 2020). Several bioreduction reaction parameters (e.g., loadings of cosubstrate HCOONa, temperature, pH, metal ion additives, etc.) influencing the bioreduction of FAL with KF2021 cells activity were examined in the aqueous media. FAL (50 mM) was transformed in 40 mL potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 6.0–9.0, 100 mM containing KF2021 whole-cell (0.050 g/mL), HCOONa (1:1–10:1, HCOONa-to-FAL molar ratio), NADPH (0.001:1, HCOONa-to-FAL molar ratio), metal ion (e.g., Al3+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Cr3+, Zn2+, K+, Ca2+, or Mn2+) (1.0 mM). Bioreduction for certain time (0–8 h) on a shaker (200 rpm, 20–50 ˚C), the samples were withdrawn for HPLC analysis. To examine FAL tolerance of reductase in KF2021 whole-cells, the bioreduction process was performed with commercial FAL at 20–100 mM. In the aqueous system (pH 7.5), whole-cell (50.0 g/L), HCOONa (HCOONa-to-FAL molar ratio 1.5:1), NADPH (NADPH-to-FAL molar ratio, 0.001:1) and FAL (20–100 mM) were incubated on a thermostats shaker (200 rpm, 40 ˚C) for 8 h. The withdrawn samples were determined with HPLC. 2.0 g CB powder (50.0 g/L, 40–60 mesh), 2.5 wt% B:LA-SG(SiO2) catalyst and 40 mL deionized water were supplemented into a reactor (100-mL). Reaction was conducted under the agitation of 500 rpm at 170 ˚C for 0.5 h. The liquor’s pH was subsequently regulated to 7.5 using NaOH. Biomass-derived FAL was catalyzed with KF2021 cells (50.0 g/L), NADPH (NADPH-to-FAL molar ratio, 0.001:1) and Ni2+ (1.2 mM) in 0–3 h at 40 ˚C. The withdrawn samples were quantified for HPLC analysis."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods Solid acid SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were measured with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrums (FT-IR), Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) as previously reported procedures (Peng et al., 2019). FAL and FOL were monitored with HPLC equipped with a Athena C18-WP column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) (Li et al., 2021b). The yield of FAL from CB was defined as the following: Yield of FAL = FAL produced (g) × 0.88 CB (g) × 0.341 × 150 96 × 100 % The FOL yield was defined as below equation: Yield of FOL = FOL produced (mM) Initial FAL (mM) × 100 %"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of DES-SiO2 catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of DES-SiO2 catalyst Using TEOS as silica source, silica prepared by sol–gel method had a large specific surface area and chemostability (Liu et al., 2021a). So far, there was limited information on the utilization of DES-loaded silica for the synthesis of solid acids to efficiently convert biomass into furfural (FAL). DES Betaine:Lactic acid (B:LA) and ChCl:Lactic acid (ChCl:LA) had same hydrogen-bond-donor (lactic acid) and different hydrogen-bond-acceptor (Betaine and ChCl). Silica was utilized as carrier to synthesize solid acid catalyst without DES (SG(SiO2)) and DES-loaded solid acid catalysts (B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2)) for transforming CB into FAL. The pore and surface structures of these solid acids were characterized via SEM, XRD, FTIR and BET analysis techniques. The morphological characteristics of SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were measured with SEM. SG(SiO2) was consisted of larger particles with even surface. The irregularly distributed pores were observed because of the existence of ethyl orthosilicate (Hajiaghababaei et al., 2011). Various hierarchical small particles appeared on B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) surface. B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) had much rougher surface, probably due to the loading of DES onto the surface (Wu et al., 2016). The states of SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were assayed by XRD. A wide range peak was observed around 25°. The characteristic diffraction peaks of B:LA-SG(SiO2) (2θ = 24.41) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) (2θ = 24.24) were slightly shifted to small angles compared to that of SG(SiO2) (2θ = 25.01). The small angle shift of diffraction peaks of B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) might result from the larger unit cell distance or the interlayer distance of the materials. The loaded DESs (B:LA and ChCl:LA) might enter into the inter-layer structure of silica, which resulted in the left shift of its diffraction angle (Zhao et al., 2017). To confirm the loading of DES on silica support, FTIR was employed to characterize SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2). The broad band observed at near 3439 cm−1 was associated with O–H stretching of H-bonded to H2O. The peak around 1739 cm−1 was related to carbonyl C = O on DESs (Mahmoodian et al., 2014). The peak around 1626 cm−1 was related to SiO-H stretching of SiO-H-bonded to H2O (El-Fakharany et al., 2019). The peaks about 1200–1000 cm−1 were ascribed to the intense Si-O vibrations of dense silica network (Al-Oweini & El-Rassy, 2009). The peaks at 1090 cm−1 and 1200 cm−1 were associated with Si-O-Si stretching (El-Fakharany et al., 2019). The peak around 952 cm−1 was attributed to silanol (Si-OH) stretching (Yuan et al., 2020). The peak at 797 cm−1 was ascribed to the symmetric Si-O-Si stretching (Lozano-Lunar et al., 2019). After the loading of DESs, the corresponding characteristic diffraction peaks of silica were retained, indicating that the DES-loading process had no significant influence on the structure of silica. The characteristic absorption peaks of carbonyl C = O in B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were obvious, indicating that the DESs had been successfully loaded on the support of silica. The surface and pore structure characteristics of SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were characterized by BET method (Table 1 ). DES could affect the specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume of materials. Low SSA was obtained after DES was loaded. SSAs of SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2), and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were 799.8, 443.9, and 517.6 m2/g, respectively. A decreased pore volume was also observed when DES was loaded. Pore volumes of SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2), and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) were 0.50, 0.38 and 0.49 cm3/g, respectively. However, an increased pore size was found due to the addition of ChCl:LA and B:LA. The pore sizes of B:LA-SG(SiO2) (3.4 nm) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) (3.9 nm) were larger than that of SG(SiO2) (0.3 nm). Probably, DES might fill micropores in materials, which would result in changes of surface and pore structure (Safa et al., 2017)."
10,Synthesis of FAL from CB with DESs-SiO2 catalysts,"3.2 Synthesis of FAL from CB with DESs-SiO2 catalysts For the efficient synthesis of FAL, it was necessary to optimize the catalytic reaction conditions (Catrinck et al., 2020). Effects of solid acid catalyst types on catalyzing CB to FAL were observed in Fig. 2 a. Compared to control without addition of solid acid catalyst, SG(SiO2), B:LA-SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) could substantially increase FAL yields. Especially, B:LA-SG(SiO2) could transform CB (50.0 g/L) to produce 58.5 mM FAL with the highest yield (45.3%). However, SG(SiO2) and ChCl:LA-SG(SiO2) gave the yield of 38.7% and 36.0%, respectively. B:LA-SG(SiO2) was chosen as the appropriate heterogeneous catalyst for synthesis of FAL. Diverse dose of B:LA-SG(SiO2) (0–5 wt%) on catalyzing CB to FAL had significant influence on the FAL yields (Fig. 2b). The generation of FAL was improved greatly with the rise of B:LA-SG(SiO2) dose from 0 to 2.5 wt%. Highest FAL yield arrived at 45.3%. Upon increasing B:LA-SG(SiO2) dose from 2.5 to 5 wt%, FAL yields dropped. The optimal B:LA-SG(SiO2) dose was 2.5 wt%. Compared with solid acid SO4 2-/SnO2-MMT and SO4 2-/SnO2-DTM (Jiang et al., 2018), B:LA-SG(SiO2) catalyst had higher catalytic activity, which could transform CB into FAL in water at relatively low of catalyst dose. Diverse temperature and time on catalyzing CB to FAL had significant effects for the FAL yields (Fig. 2c). FAL yield reached the maximum (45.3%) at 170 ˚C within 0.5 h. In summary, the supplementary of B:LA-SG(SiO2) (2.5 wt%, 1 g) and 40 mL water into the reactor (100-mL) enabled the efficient catalysis of CB (50.0 g/L) to FAL (58.5 mM) by stirring (500 rmp) at 170 ˚C for 0.5 h, and it was confirmed with HPLC. The FAL liquor contained FAL (58.5 mM), HMF (7.2 mM), HCOOH (0.51 mM) and levulinic acid (0.91 mM). FAL was obtained at 46% yield from CB using ChCl-OA (2 g) as catalyst in ChCl-OA/DOP biphasic system with the addition of AlCl3⋅6H2O (50 mg) and H2SO4 (1.0 wt%) at 120 ˚C (Bu et al., 2021). Oxalic acid was used as co-catalyst for assisting SO4 2-/SnO2-argil to transform hemicellulose-derived D-xylose into FAL at 180 ˚C (Xue et al., 2018). Sulfonic acid resins (Amberlyst-15) was used for catalyzing alginic acid to produce FAL with 32% yield in γ-butyrolactone–H2O (Kim et al. 2020). In this work, a higher FAL yield was achieved in the aqueous media using B:LA-SG(SiO2) as catalyst. It was one kind of metal-free catalyst, which had the characteristic of simple preparation, easy to operate, and environmentally-friendly to equipment as well as the environment. To test the reusability of B:LA-SG(SiO2) solid acid, it was attempted to reuse for five times to catalyze the synthesis of FAL from CB (50.0 g/L). Each batch was performed for 0.5 h in an autoclave (170 ˚C) containing 40 mL water. Reusing B:LA-SG(SiO2) from 1st to 3th batch, a stable B:LA-SG(SiO2) reusability was observed, and FAL yield dropped slightly from 45.3% to 43.3%. When CB was catalyzed at 3th and 5th batch, FAL yields arrived at 43.3% and 39.7%, respectively. B:LA-SG(SiO2) had good stability could be used repeatedly to catalyze CB to FAL. The sulfonated zeolites were reused seven times, and the FAL yield decreased from 52% (1st run) to 37% (7th run) (Li et al., 2021b). Sn-MMT was reused three times and the yield of FAL decreased by 11.7% (Li et al., 2015). The results showed that solid acid had good reusability, and the efficient recovery and reuse of B:LA-SG(SiO2) could potentially reduce the operating cost."
11,Possible catalytic mechanism for converting biomass to FAL with B:LA-SG(SiO2),"3.3 Possible catalytic mechanism for converting biomass to FAL with B:LA-SG(SiO2) Potential mechanism was proposed involving B:LA-SG(SiO2)-catalyzed transformation of CB into FAL in water. Cl- could disrupt the hydrogen bonds existing in the matrix of lignin-xylan-glucan. Lactic acid and HCl provided H+ to disrupt β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, which depolymerized and hydrolysized xylan. Under the acidic condition, B:LA as solvent could pretreat biomass, and glucan and xylan in lignocelluose were hydrolyzed into glucose and D-xylose with H+. B:LA-SG(SiO2) contained Lewis and Börnsted acid sites, which dehydrated biomass-derived D-xylose into FAL. The presence of Lewis acid and Brönsted acid sites existed on catalyst favored the catalysis of biomass synthesis of FAL, which was consistent with previous studies (Ji et al., 2021). Lewis acid and Brönsted acid sites isomerized aldose-ketose and accelerated the formation of FAL via ring dehydration (Padilla-Rascón et al., 2020). Generally, biomass-derived D-xylose molecule was isomerized by Lewis acids into more reactive isomer xylulose, which was then dehydrated by Brönsted acid to generate FAL. Biomass-derived glucose was isomerized followed by dehydration into 5-HMF, accompanying with formic acid and levulinic acid. In this work, synergistic catalysis of xylan and glucan in biomass into FAL, HMF and their derivatives was firstly discovered by B:LA-SG(SiO2) catalyst in the aqueous system."
12,Biosynthesis of FOL from FAL with KF2021 cells,"3.4 Biosynthesis of FOL from FAL with KF2021 cells Utilization of biocatalysis to synthesize key intermediates is a sustainable route due to mild performance conditions (Liao et al., 2020). Biocatalytic temperature, reaction pH, metal ions, etc., have a major impact on whole-cell activity (Cheng et al., 2020). Fig. 3 a depicted the effect of the cosubstrate HCOONa dose on the reduction of FAL by KF2021 whole-cells. HCOONa as a cosubstrate had a significant effect on the activity of KF2021. With the rise of HCOONa-to-FAL molar ratio from 2:1 to 10:1, the activity of KF2021 gradually decreased. Thus, the optimal HCOONa dosage was selected at 1.5:1 of HCOONa-to-FAL molar ratio. High doses of cosubstrate might have exceeded the tolerance of KF2021 cells which resulted in the reduced biocatalytic activity. In the previous work, FOL was synthesized at 30 ˚C with CCZU-H15 cells using cosubstrate glucose at 1:2 of glucose-to-FAL molar ratio (Qin and He, 2020). However, gluconic acid, which was produced using glucose as cosubstrate during the bioreaction process, negatively affected reductase activity and a constant adjustment of reaction medium’ pH was required. The market price of glucose would pose an economic barrier to the industrial application in the bioreduction of FAL to FOL. HCOONa was less expensive compared to glucose as cosubstrate. HCOONa could be oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) by formate dehydrogenase (FDH) with the concomitant bioconversion of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. CO2 might escape from the reaction system, and no additional pH adjustment was necessary during the bioreaction, making the operation simpler and greener. The biocatalytic temperature affected the bioreduction activity clearly (Fig. 3b). The highest bioreduction activity was found at 40 ˚C. Over this temperature, the bioreduction activity decreased gradually. The biocatalytic pH (6.0–9.0) had significant effects on the bioreduction activity (Fig. 3c). The highest bioreduction activity was found at pH 7.5. Thus, the appropriate for bioreduction pH was 7.5. Diverse metal ions (1.0 mM) were supplemented to the bioreaction system for enhancing the FAL-reducing activity of KF2021 (Fig. 3d). Zn2+, K+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ inhibited catalytic activity. Al3+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, and Cr3+ enhanced the FAL-reducing activities. Ni2+ promoted bioreduction activity significantly. Diverse dosage of Ni2+ (0–1.8 mM) on bioreduction activity were examined at 40 ˚C in the aqueous system (pH 7.5) (Fig. 3e). By supplementing 1.2 mM Ni2+ to the bioreaction media, the bioreduction activity arrived at the highest value. In the previous study, using glucose as cosubstrate, Ni2+ (0.1 mM) promoted the CCZU-K14 reductase activity (He et al., 2018). The apparent Ni2+ requirement by KF2021 cells was similar to that of an NAD(P)H-dependent reductase (ScCR) from S. coelicolor (Wang et al., 2011). In addition, different loading of commercial FAL (20–100 mM) were evaluated on the effects of bioreduction (Fig. 4 a). When FAL didn’t exceed 60 mM, the inhibitory effect of FAL concentration on KF2021 cells was not obvious. Bioreduction of 20 mM and 60 mM FAL within 8 h, the generated FOL were 16.4 mM and 55.4 mM. However, with FAL concentrations of 80 mM and 100 mM, only 47.2 mM and 45.6 mM FOL were obtained. In the previous report, B. coagulans transformed 100 mM FAL to 5 mM FOL in 24 h at pH 7.0 and 50 ˚C (Yan et al., 2018). M. guilliermondii converted 50 mM FAL into FOL with 83% yield at pH 7.2 and 35 ˚C in 5 h (Li et al., 2017)."
13,Valorization of CB into FOL via chemoenzymatic cascade synthesis,"3.5 Valorization of CB into FOL via chemoenzymatic cascade synthesis Chemoenzymatic cascade catalysis for the synthesis of highly value-added chemicals because of their green and sustainable nature has been a research hotspot in recent years (Wang et al., 2020a). After the conversion of at 170 ˚C for 0.5 h, the FAL liquor contained FAL (58.5 mM), HMF (7.2 mM), HCOOH (0.51 mM) and levulinic acid (0.91 mM). After pH of FAL liquor was adjusted to 7.5, KF2021 cells was used for transforming FAL. As shown in Fig. 4b, FAL (56.3 mM) was transformed for 180 min to yield 55.0 mM FOL with 97.7% yield. Similar to transformation of commercial FAL, CB-derived FAL was rapidly converted to FOL in a short period time at the same biocatalytic temperature and pH. As shown in Fig. 4b, bioreduction of CB-derived FAL (0.225 g) for 30–180 min, 0.205–0.224 g of FOL was obtained. Related to commercial FAL, CB-derived FAL could accelerate FOL formation. Sugars in FAL liquor might promote the enzyme activity. To test HMF and levulinic acid on the effects of FAL bioreduction, Substrate 1 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM)], Substrate 2 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM) plus HMF (6.9 mM)], Substrate 3 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM) plus levulinic acid (0.88 mM)], Substrate 4 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM), levulinic acid (0.88 mM) plus HMF (6.9 mM)] were prepared and transformed into FOL with KF2021 cells. Compared to substrate 1 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM)], substrate 2 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM) plus HMF (6.9 mM)] could slightly inhibit bioreduction activity. However, Substrate 3 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM) plus levulinic acid (0.88 mM)] and Substrate 4 [commercial FAL (56.3 mM), levulinic acid (0.88 mM) plus HMF (6.9 mM)] had no significant inhibition on the bioreduction of FAL. The CB-derived FAL liquor contained FAL, HMF and levulinic acid, and no clear inhibition was found on the FAL bioreduction. This strategy for tandem catalysis of CB using B:LA-SG(SiO2) catalyst and KF2021 whole-cells was feasible. Mass balance was calculated. The chemoenzymatic cascade valorization of lignocellulosic biomass to yield FOL was constructed with B:LA-SG(SiO2) chemocatalyst and KF2021 reductase biocatalyst. 2.0 kg CB and 1.0 kg B:LA-SG(SiO2) were supplemented into a reactor (100-L) with 40 L water by stirring (500 rpm) at 170 ˚C for 0.5 h. 40 L of FAL liquor was obtained containing 225 g of FAL. The pH of the FAL liquor was adjusted to 7.5. In the presence of 6.22 g NiCl2·and 1.742 g NADPH, FAL liquor was biotransformed into FOL (0.224 kg) with KF2021 whole-cells at pH 7.5 and 40 ˚C within 180 min. The FOL yield was 0.112 kg FOL/kg CB (0.328 kg FOL/kg xylan in CB). The cascade catalysis using DESs supported solid acid catalyst and KF2021 whole-cells harboring FDH and reductase was constructed for one-pot tandem conversion of CB into FOL in the aqueous system. The raw materials (e.g., DESs and TEOS, etc.) of DESs-SiO2 catalysts were metal-free, nontoxic, biocompatible and low-cost. The preparation processes of these catalysts were controllable and easy to operate with short reaction time. The use of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) to success coenzyme regeneration has attracted much attentions because of the formed benign byproduct (CO2) (Li et al., 2021b). The combination of chemocatalysis and biocatalysis in one same reactor, without the need to isolate the formed intermediates, would reduce operating time, reduce equipment input and waste generation, and had good potential for industrial applications."
14,Conclusions,"DESs were immobilized on silica by sol–gel method with TEOS as silica source for firstly efficiently valorizing biomass into FAL, and the optimized biomass-to-FAL performance was established. Possible catalytic mechanism for transforming biomass into FAL and its derivative was proposed. The biomass-derived FAL was efficiently biotransformed into FOL by newly constructed recombinant E. coli KF2021 whole-cells harboring reductase and FDH. One-pot conversion of CB (50.0 g/L) to FOL at 44.3% yield (based on xylan in CB) was developed via chemoenzymatic cascade catalysis with B:LA-SG(SiO2) chemocatalyst and KF2021 biocatalyst. This strategy provided an environment-friendly strategy for valorization of CB to FOL."
