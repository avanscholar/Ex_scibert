0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an important energy carrier and a promising substitute for fossil fuels because of its high energy density and environmental sustainability (Ren et al., 2011). Biohydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation integrates waste treatment with high-efficiency bioenergy recovery at low-cost and has great prospect for development and application (Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). Mixed-culture fermentations have various advantages in application: they are easily inoculated, are highly adaptable to environmental changes, and have a strong capacity to degrade various organic substrates (Dionisi and Silva, 2016). Due to the different waste substrate concentrations, unsuitable oxygen contents, and the complex dynamics at play in microbial community formation, the microbial biofilms or granule aggregates need a long time to reach steady state, which has a tremendous effect on the fermentation product formation and bioenergy recovery in wastewater treatment systems (Lin et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2018). Fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) can utilize carbohydrates in wastewater or waste biomass as substrates for growth, producing H2, volatile fattty acids, and alcohols as a result (Li et al., 2019; Xing et al., 2008). The hydrogen production by most highly-efficient HPB requires an anoxic environment due to the oxygen sensitivity of central enzymes in the fermentation process such as pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and [FeFe]-hydrogenase (Pachapur et al., 2017). Clostridium and Ethanoligenens, as the representative genera of mesophilic HPB, often prevail in continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors carrying out different types of fermentations (Calusinska et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2007). Dissolved oxygen present in the feedstocks inhibits the growth and H2-metabolism of these anaerobic HPB, which leads to long start-up periods (generally over a month) for establishing stable populations in hydrogen-producing reactors (Guo et al., 2008a; Han et al., 2012; Li et al., 2007). Therefore, a combination of deoxygenization with pre-immobilization might facilitate enrichment of HPB and shorten the start-up time of continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors. Anaerobic conditions can be maintained in continuous-flow H2-producing reactors via nitrogen flushing or addition of reducing agents, both of which are costly and unsuitable approaches at industrial scale operation (Pachapur et al., 2017). Alternatively, a deoxygenization approach of inoculating oxygen containing medium with aerobes or facultative anaerobes has been shown to be fairly effective in creating strict anaerobic conditions (Kumar et al., 2016b; Wang and Yin, 2017). A co-culture of the obligate anaerobic Clostridium butyricum and the facultative anaerobic Enterobacter aerogenes successfully produced hydrogen in medium containing oxygen (Pachapur et al., 2017; Yokoi et al., 1998). A recent study showed that continuous addition of H2O2 significantly enhanced hydrogen production in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) under micro-aerobic conditions by promoting the enrichment of facultative anaerobic microorganisms to consume oxygen for the growth of HPB (Paillet et al., 2019). Therefore, inoculation with aerobes or facultative anaerobes as O2 scavengers may be an effective strategy for fast start-up of continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative mesophilic aerobe found ubiquitously in nature that is capable of forming biofilms and thriving in diverse ecological niches (Riquelme et al., 2020). The optimum temperature and pH for cultivation of P. aeruginosa is 37 °C and 7.0 ± 0.2, respectively, which are consistent with the optimal conditions for cell growth and H2-metabolism of HPB (D'Argenio et al., 2002; Ren et al., 2007). Thus P. aeruginosa may serve well as an O2 scavenger in continuous-flow H2-producing reactors. Loss of bacterial cells can occur in continuous-flow reactors, which lead to a long period for granule or biofilm formation of HPB, thus it is necessary to promote the formation of these structures quickly through microbial immobilization, to retain the cell density in the reactor (Bakonyi et al., 2014b). A previous study showed that inoculation of pre-enriched H2-producing consortium effectively enhanced hydrogen production in an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor (ASBBR) (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2016). An expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor with granular biomass showed higher H2 production from acid agave bagasse hydrolysates compared with an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (AnSBR) with suspended cells (Muñoz-Páez et al., 2020). H2-producing granules improved the H2 production and shortened the start-up period of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor (Jung et al., 2013a, 2013b). Thus, the pre-immobilization and granulation in continuous-flow reactors may be an effective way to quickly recruit HPB and retain cell biomass. Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) utilize suspended bio-carriers to support high biomass density in compact operation units, which can enhance the performance of different wastewater treatment processes, such as nutrient removal (Almomani and Bohsale, 2020) and phosphorus removal (Ribera-Pi et al., 2020). It is also considered to be a suitable reactor configuration for cultivating biofilms, which can greatly reduce the loss of cell biomass from a reactor. However, no studies have yet been reported on the utilization of MBBRs for hydrogen production. The start-up performance and hydrogen production in the continuous-flow MBBRs integrating a sequential immobilization and deoxygenization (SIDO) method was assessed in this study. The pre-immobilized carriers were used to rapidly recruit HPB and the inoculation of aerobic P. aeruginosa served to provide a continuous oxygen scavenger. The main purpose of this study is to investigate a fast start-up and optimization strategy for hydrogen production in MBBRs under micro-aerobic conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Pre-immobilization of the inoculum,"2.1 Pre-immobilization of the inoculum The inoculum in this experiment consisted of pre-immobilized biofilms and granules formed by HPB and aerobic bacteria, which were acquired in an acclimation step. Activated sludge was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank of Wenchang municipal wastewater treatment plant (Harbin, China) and was acclimated in two identical anaerobic bottles after heat treatment at 100 °C for 40 min. Each anaerobic bottle (1 L) was loaded with 300 mL heat treated activated sludge, 700 mL diluted waste molasses and polyurethane sponge carriers (50% filling ratio). One of these bottles was additionally inoculated with 100 mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture (OD600 0.6), while the second bottle was pre-sparged with ultrapure N2 (99.999%) for 20 min to ensure anoxic conditions. Prior to inoculation, the facultative aerobic P. aeruginosa was cultured in LB medium (10 g/L peptone, 10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L yeast extract) in flasks under aerobic conditions at 35 °C. Waste molasses was obtained from Fengtangsugar factory (Liuzhou, China) and a 15 g/L solution was prepared by dilution with distilled water. This solution had a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 25101 ± 147.58 mg/L, and the COD: N: P ratio of the diluted waste molasses was adjusted to 500–1000: 5: 1 by addition of peptone and K2HPO4 as nitrogen and phosphorous source, respectively. The initial pH was adjusted to 8.0 ± 0.2 using 1 mol/L NaOH and 1 mol/L HCl. The two bottles were acclimated at 35 °C with shaking at a speed of 100 rpm, and were fed with diluted waste molasses every three days. The entire acclimation period lasted for 5–7 days, which was determined through the observation of the formation of granules and biofilms and the detection of gas component content in gas bag connected to each anaerobic bottles. After 5–7 days of acclimation, the proportions of hydrogen in the gas bags reached about 20%, biofilms were formed on the carriers and a lot of granules were formed at the bottom of the anaerobic bottles."
3,MBBR configuration and operation,"2.2 MBBR configuration and operation The MBBR was made of transparent plexiglass with an effective volume of 1.0 L, including a reaction section with 4 cm internal diameter and 28 cm length, and an upper settling section with 10 cm internal diameter and 8 cm length (Fig. 1 ). At the top of each reactor was a three-phase separator to prevent the loss of granule aggregates and to collect the generated gas. A cube-shaped polyurethane sponge (8 × 8 × 8 mm) was selected as the immobilization carrier of the MBBR, which occupied up to 30% of the working volume of each reactor. The pre-immobilized inocula (biofilms and granules) from the aforementioned anaerobic bottles, with and without P. aeruginosa were added to Pse-MBBR and N2-MBBR, respectively (Table 1 ). The N2-MBBR and its feeding solution were sparged with ultra-high pure N2 gas (99.999%) to remove oxygen. A third P. aeruginosa-inoculated MBBR without pre-immobilized biofilm carriers (Pse-N-MBBR) was used as control. A volume of 50 mL additional P. aeruginosa culture (OD600 0.6) was used to reinoculate one-time both the Pse-MBBR and the Pse-N-MBBR to strengthen the effectiveness of deoxygenization during operation. The feeding solution of each reactor was diluted waste molasses (15 g/L), which was same with solution used in the pre-immobilization process. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of each reactor was fixed at 13 h with an organic loading rate of 25.10 kg COD/m3. The up-flow rate was held constant at 3.35 m/h by controlling the recirculation ratio at 100: 1 using a peristaltic pump (BT100-2 J, Longer Pump Ltd., China) to keep the carriers in suspension. All reactors were operated in a temperature-controlled room at 35 °C for 30 days."
4,Chemical analyses and calculation,"2.3 Chemical analyses and calculation The metal ions of the molasses were digested with concentrated nitric acid and analyzed using a inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (SPECTROBLUE Ltd., Germany). The total organic carbon (TOC) and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) of molasses were measured using the Multi N/C ®2100 analyzer (Analytik Jena, Germany). Gas production of MBBR was recorded using a multi-channel respirometer (AER-208, Challenge Environmental Systems Inc., USA) connected to the top of each reactor, and the gas produced was collected in gas bags (1 L, DeLin, China). Before operation, the gas passages of the respirometer and gas bags were flushed with filter-sterilized N2 gas (ultrapure, 99.999%) to remove residual gas. Gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, and N2 gas (ultrapure, 99.999%) was utilized as the carrier gas for the GC. The hydrogen production rate (QH2 , mL/L-medium·h) was calculated based on the stable cumulative hydrogen production normalized to the liquid volume. The hydrogen yield (YH2 ) was calculated as the molar value of hydrogen production normalized to the molar value of substrate consumption (mol H2/mol-glucose, 1 g glucose ≈1.067 g COD). COD was measured using a potassium dichromate method (HACH DR/3900 Spectrophotometer, Loveland, Co., USA). Glucose was measured using the Glucose Detection Kit (Shanghai Rongsheng Biotech Co., Ltd., China) and sucrose was measured using the Sucrose Measurement Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Inc., China). The utilization ratios of glucose and surcose were calculated as previously described (Logan and Regan, 2006; Lu et al., 2012). Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were measured by gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP) with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The pH was measured using a pH meter (PHSe3C, Yangguang Lab. App. Co. Ltd., China)."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis The bacterial biofilms on the carriers and granule aggregates in the SIDO-MBBRs were observed by an optical microscope (Olympus CX23, Olympus Corporation Inc., Japan). Bacterial cells in the granules or the biofilms were harvested at 25 d, centrifuged at 12000×g for 5 min, and washed twice with 0.9% NaCl. Genomic DNA was extracted using FastDNA® Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the universal bacterial primers, 341F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). Afterpurification and quality determination, the PCR amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq PE250 platform. Fast Length Adjustment of Short reads (FLASH, http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/) software was used for the sequenceassembly (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011). Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by setting a 97% similarity using UPARSE (http://drive5.com/uparse/) software (Edgar, 2013). The OTU representative sequences were taxonomically classified using the GreenGene (http://greengenes.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/nph-index.cgi) database and Ribosomal Database Project (RDP, http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/) classifier (v.2.2) with a minimum confidence of 0.6 (Cole et al., 2014). Alpha diversity assessment was applied for analyzing complexity of species diversity in the samples (Schloss et al., 2009). The Venn diagram was drawn by the VennDiagram feature of software R (v3.1.1) and principal component analysis (PCA) of OTUs was performed using the package 'ade4′ of software R (v3.1.1). The representative OTU phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, http://qiime.org) software (Caporaso et al., 2010)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pre-immobilization enhanced hydrogen production in SIDO-MBBRs,"3.1 Pre-immobilization enhanced hydrogen production in SIDO-MBBRs The main gaseous fermentation products in each reactor were H2 and CO2 (Fig. 2 ). Rsults indicated that gas production was substantially improved in the SIDO-MBBRs. The cumulative gas production of the N2-MBBR was 16992.11 mL, similar to that of the Pse-MBBR (15117.70 mL), but much higher than that of the Pse-N-MBBR (7019.12 mL) (Fig. 2a). The maximum gas production rates of the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR were 1837.31 and 1471.94 mL/d, respectively, which were both higher than that of the Pse-N-MBBR (646.41 mL/d) (Fig. 2a). There were significant differences in cumulative hydrogen production, hydrogen production rates, and hydrogen yields of the different reactors (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05, n = 3). The highest cumulative hydrogen production was achieved in the N2-MBBR (6841.37 mL), followed by the Pse-MBBR (6083.82 mL), which reached 88.93% of that achieved in the N2-MBBR, while the Pse-N-MBBR produced only 2732.02 mL H2 (Fig. 2b). The average fraction of hydrogen in the gas produced of the different MBBRs ranged from 38.92% to 40.26%. The maximum hydrogen production rates of the N2-MBBR, Pse-MBBR and Pse-N-MBBR were 36.35 ± 0.58 mM/d, 26.38 ± 1.34 mM/d and 8.43 ± 1.29 mM/d, respectively (Fig. 2c). The maximum hydrogen yield of the N2-MBBR was 0.77 ± 0.08 mol-H2/mol-glucose, which was higher than each of other two reactors (0.56 ± 0.05 and 0.27 ± 0.07 mol-H2/mol-glucose, respectively) (Fig. 2d). The N2-MBBR and the Pse-MBBR achieved considerably higher hydrogen production efficiencies compared with the Pse-N-MBBR. Pse-MBBR had the highest H2 production in the initial stage of operation (0–5 days), indicating that the sequential immobilization integrated with the deoxygenization strategy based on inoculation of aerobic P. aeruginosa in the SIDO-MBBR system played a key role in promoting H2 production."
8,VFA concentrations and substrate utilization in MBBRs,"3.2 VFA concentrations and substrate utilization in MBBRs Ethanol, acetic acid, and butyric acid were the major organic components in the effluents of the different reactors (Fig. 3 ). Maximum ethanol concentrations reached 66.89 and 56.32 mM in the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR, respectively, which were much higher than that reached in the Pse-N-MBBR (21.56 mM) (Fig. 3a). No significant difference was observed in cumulative ethanol production between the N2-MBBR (758.30 mM) and Pse-MBBR (780.44 mM), but both produced much more than the Pse-N-MBBR (274.56 mM) (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05, n = 3). Little difference in acetate concentration was observed between N2-MBBR, Pse-MBBR, and Pse-N-MBBR, which reached maximum acetate concentrations of 20.78, 18.54 and 23.89 mM, respectively (Fig. 3b). Substantial butyric acid was detected in the effluents of N2-MBBR, Pse-MBBR, and Pse-N-MBBR, reaching maximum concentrations of 22.36, 19.73 and 9.62 mM, respectively (Fig. 3c). Cumulative butyric acid production reached 311.48 mM in the N2-MBBR and it was continuously produced over the operation period. Butyric acid production was high in the Pse-MBBR over the first 19 days but dropped off after day 20 (total of 263.60 mM), while the Pse-N-MBBR mainly produced butyric acid only in the later stage of operation (total of 120.56 mM). The accumulation of acid caused a variation in effluent pH (Fig. 3d). The pH of the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR decreased distinctly in the first 3 days, then bounced back and eventually stabilized around 5.43–5.56, while the pH value of the Pse-N-MBBR continuously decreased from 8 to 4.4. With an influent COD of 25101.02 mg/L, the COD removal rates of each reactor fluctuated between 16.29% and 54.26%, with maximum COD removal efficiencies reaching 54.25%, 51.66% and 50.46% in the N2-MBBR, Pse-MBBR, and Pse-N-MBBR, respectively (Fig. 4 a and b). Sucrose and glucose utilization rates were more stable than COD removal rates, and were much higher in the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR compared with the Pse-N-MBBR (Fig. 4c and d). The raw molasses contained mostly sucrose (60.72%) and a small amount of glucose (1.42%), demonstrating that sucrose was utilized as the main carbon source for reactors (Table 2 ). The sucrose utilization rates of the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR were similar and slowly declined from 80% to 60% with maximumsucrose utilization rates of 77.69% and 84.92%, respectively (Fig. 4d). Sucrose utilization in the Pse-N-MBBR was as high as the other two reactors in the early phase of operation, but sharply decreased below 40% after day 13. Compared with the Pse-N-MBBR, the SIDO-MBBRs (N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR) were more effective at converting waste molasses into H2, VFAs and ethanol."
9,Microbiomes and dominant HPB in the SIDO-MBBRs,"3.3 Microbiomes and dominant HPB in the SIDO-MBBRs After operation for 2 days, bacterial biofilms were formed on the carriers in the SIDO-MBBRs and white granule aggregates (2–4 mm in diameter) were cultivated at the bottom of each reactor, which were observed by an optical microscope. Over 60,000 high-qualified tags with an average length of 252 bp for each sample were obtained by Illumina Miseq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Shannon and Simpson indices showed that community diversity in all samples was low (Table 3 ). The communities in the N2-MBBR had a relatively higher diversity than those of the other reactors. The community diversity of biofilms was slightly higher than that of granules in the MBBRs. Venn diagram shows that 12 OTUs were shared across all samples, and the largest difference in the community structure was between the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that samples from the three reactors formed separate clusters, while the communities of the granules and biofilms from within the same reactors clustered together, indicating that the greatest differences in the microbial communities were between different reactors (Fig. 5 ). The predominant phyla in the communities of the three reactors were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (Fig. 6 a). The relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were 50.33–59.97% and 40.02–49.67%, respectively, in the N2-MBBR. Communities in the Pse-MBBR were dominated by Proteobacteria (64.49–64.60%) and Firmicutes (35.39–35.51%). By contrast, the relative abundance of Firmicutes (23.67%) was much lower than that of Proteobacteria (76.33%) in the Pse-N-MBBR. Microbial community structures in the Pse-MBBR and Pse-N-MBBR at the later stage of operation (25th day after inoculation) were similar at the genus level, and were different from that of the N2-MBBR (Fig. 6b). Predominant populations in the granules and carrier biofilms taken from the same reactor were similar. The majority population in the Pse-MBBR was affiliated with Enterobacter sp. (51.56% in granules and 56.11% in biofilms), followed by Clostridium sp. (30.65% in granules and 30.99% in biofilms), Pseudomonas sp. (12.94% in granules and 8.48% in biofilms), Lactobacillus sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., and Ethanoligenens sp. (Fig. 6b). Similarly, the predominant populations in the Pse-N-MBBR were Enterobacter sp. (63.99%), Clostridium sp. (22.26%), and Pseudomonas sp. (8.58%). The predominant genera in the N2-MBBR were also Enterobacter sp. (59.47% in granules and 49.89% in biofilms) and Clostridium sp. (36.84% in granules and 43.31% in biofilms), but Clostridium sp. accounted for a larger proportion of these microbial communities compared with those of the Pse-MBBR and Pse-N-MBBR. The Lactobacillus sp. population in the N2-MBBR (1.14% in granules and 5.26% in biofilms) and the Pse-MBBR (2.75% in granules and 2.91% in biofilms) was greater than that in the Pse-N-MBBR (0.64% in granules). The relative abundance of Pseudomonas sp. in the N2-MBBR was only 0.43–0.49%, since there was no exogenous Pseudomonas sp. added during acclimation. In addition, hydrogen-producing Ethanoligenens sp. were detected in the N2-MBBR, Pse-MBBR and Pse-N-MBBR at 0.25–0.36%, 0.62% and 0.05%, respectively. The microbial community analyses revealed that the HPB were effectively enriched in the different reactors. The relative abundance of total HPB (Enterobacter sp., Clostridium sp., Stenotrophomonas sp., Paenibacillus sp., Escherichia sp., and Ethanoligenens sp.) achieved 82.82–96.56% in all MBBRs. Phylogenetic analysis at the genus level indicated that Clostridium sp., Propionibacterium sp., Ethanoligenens sp. and Bacteroides sp. in ClusterⅡ were among the most common HPB, which carry out different types of fermentation. The functional classification of KEGG Orthology (KOs) based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence information also showed substantial differences among the samples of three reactors."
10,Rapid recruitment of HPB by sequential immobilization in SIDO-MBBR,"3.4 Rapid recruitment of HPB by sequential immobilization in SIDO-MBBR Dissolved oxygen present in the influent and headspace of reactors can inhibit the growth of HPB, and bacterial loss in continuous-flow reactors can retard the enrichment of HPB; as a result a long start-up period (longer than 10 days) is required for hydrogen-producing reactors (Guo et al., 2008a; Kumar et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2020). In this study, rapid recruitment of hydrogen-producing biofilms and granules in the continuous-flow SIDO-MBBRs was investigated. The combination of SIDO and MBBR substantially accelerated the start-up of hydrogen-producing reactors compared with the non-immobilized reactors (Fig. 2a). The hydrogen production rates of SIDO-MBBRs were rapidly increased at the initial stage (the first one to five days), indicating SIDO-MBBRs had shorter start-up time than previously reported hydrogen-producing reactors (from 20 days to a few months) (Castillo-Hernández et al., 2015; Han et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2013a). Contrasting that, substrate conversion efficiency and hydrogen production in the Pse-N-MBBR were low throughout the full operation period. The higher hydrogen production capacity of SIDO-MBBRs is attributed to the porous sponge carriers through: (1) immobilization of the acclimated bacteria and acceleration of the initial enrichment of slow-growing HPB and (2) promoting the biofilm formation in continuous-flow MBBRs that helps to prevent loss of biomass (Guo et al., 2008a; Kumar et al., 2016b). In addition, after a period of operation, the biofilm shedding from the sponge carriers, which floating at the upper part of the MBBR formed granule aggregates driven by the acting force of the internal circulation. The results suggest that the SIDO approach was effective at facilitating biofilm formation and sludge granulation in the MBBRs, which lead to increased biomass in the MBBRs and substantially enhanced hydrogen production. Compared with some other reactors, the SIDO-MBBR had higher COD removal rate, especially at the beginning of operation (Guo et al., 2008b; Ramos and Silva, 2017). However, the performances of hydrogen production (Fig. 2) and COD removal (Fig. 4) of SIDO-MBBR declined over time, mainly due to the poor mass transfer through the sponge carriers and the constant accumulation of dead cells. Therefore, further studies need to be performed to test different carriers that could give better performance and improve reactor productivity. The low community diversity in the SIDO-MBBRs was mainly due to the heat-shock treatment and subsequent acclimation process of activated sludge which facilitated enrichment of endospore-forming HPB (such as Clostridium) (Bakonyi et al., 2014a; Wang and Yin, 2017). The predominant populations in the MBBR reactors were Enterobacter sp. (49.88–63.99%) and Clostridium sp. (22.26–43.31%) (Fig. 6), which have been shown to have hydrogen production capacity in anaerobic fermentation (Ren et al., 2007; Xing et al., 2008). This suggests that the pre-immobilization was conducive to enrichment of HPB in these continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors. However, the operation of the SIDO-MBBR was not sufficiently stable, and could be further improved by changing the bioreactor configuration or by regulating operational parameters such as HRT, pH, and substrate concentration."
11,Effects of deoxygenization on performance of SIDO-MBBRs,"3.5 Effects of deoxygenization on performance of SIDO-MBBRs H2-production capacity of HPB can be inhibited by O2 because the central enzymes (especially FeFe-hydrogenase) involved in the fermentation pathways of HPB are oxygen sensitive (Lee et al., 2010). Flushing with ultrapure N2 (99.999%) is a common way to remove oxygen at laboratory scale, but is restricted in practical application due to high costs and the added operational complexity. An alternative approach can be to inoculate reactors with aerobes or facultative anaerobes to consume oxygen and create a strict anaerobic environment during the initial start-up phase of the bioreactor (Kumar et al., 2016b). Oxygen scavenging aerobic bacteria can be easily washed out from the continuous-flow reactors during the start-up stage, which can result in longer deoxygenation and start-up periods for reactors. In this study, the hydrogen-production performance in MBBRs applying these two different oxygen removal methods was compared. The Pse-MBBR showed a higher hydrogen yield (0.56 ± 0.05 mol-H2/mol-glucose) at the initial stage of operation and finally reached 88.93% of the cumulative hydrogen production of the N2-MBBR (Fig. 2a), most likely due rapid consumption of oxygen by the pre-immobilized P. aeruginosa in MBBRs, which quickly created a suitable micro-aerobic condition for facultative anaerobic hydrogen-producing bacteria (such as Enterobacter sp.) (Wang and Yin, 2017; Zhang et al., 2011). However, the hydrogen production capacity of the N2-MBBR gradually improved along the entire operational period and exceeded the Pse-MBBR by day 5. This can be attributed to enrichment of obligate anaerobic HPB (such as Clostridium sp.) in the N2-MBBR that remarkably improved the gas production performance of the MBBRs. P. aeruginosa has the ability to form biofilm and has no competition from HPB for utilization of sugar as a carbon source (Riquelme et al., 2020), which is why inoculation with pre-immobilized P. aeruginosa can serve as an alternative method for deoxygenation of MBBRs. The relative abundance of P. aeruginosa in the later operation stage of the Pse-MBBR was 8.48–12.94% due to the low oxygen concentration (Fig. 6). Instead, the facultative anaerobic Enterobacter sp. comprised 51.25% of the total community and might be responsible for abating the residual oxygen at this stage, maintining the low redox potential required for growth of the strict anaerobic Clostridium sp. (García-Depraect et al., 2019). Further studies focusing on redox potential change and community dynamics are needed to provide definitive evidence for the deoxygenation ability of these facultative anaerobes. Other aerobic bacteria could be screened to serve as inoculant for deoxygenation of SIDO-MBBRs, while inoculum density and immobilization time can be further investigated to enhance the deoxygenation efficiency."
12,Microbial interactions in the SIDO-MBBRs,"3.6 Microbial interactions in the SIDO-MBBRs The syntrophic interaction of various microbes in anaerobic fermentation can substantially improve hydrogen production (Xing et al., 2008). Facultative aerobes create low redox potential conditions for the growth of obligate anaerobic hydrogen productors during long-term operation (Kumar et al., 2016b; Wang and Yin, 2017). Meanwhile, cross-feeding interactions between different fermentative bacteria are universal. The primary fermenters degrade complex organic matters and provide metabolites for other partner microbes as carbon or energy sources (McInerney et al., 2009). Microbial community analysis suggested that Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp. were the predominant populations in all reactors (Fig. 6) and they have previously been identified as HPB in fermentation systems (Jeong et al., 2013; Wang and Yin, 2017). As a representative spore-forming HPB, obligate anaerobic Clostridium sp. has a high hydrogen-production capacity and its small molecule metabolites (lactate, acetate, butyrate, ethanol, H2, and CO2, etc.) can further serve as electron donors or electron carriers to other microbes such as denitrifiers, iron and sulphate reducers, and acetogens (Koendjbiharie et al., 2018; Nasr et al., 2017). The N2-MBBR achieved the highest hydrogen production efficiency among the three MBBRs (Fig. 2), which might be attributed to the high proportion of Clostridium sp. (40.08%) found in the reactor. Meanwhile, Enterobacter sp. not only contributed to the H2 yield in both the N2-MBBR and Pse-MBBR but also provided the strict anaerobic environment required for Clostridium sp. growth by scavenging oxygen. Several studies have shown that interactions between Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp. substantially improved hydrogen production efficiency in facultative anaerobic reactors by removed O2 without any reducing agents (Chen et al., 2015; Yokoi et al., 1998). This cooperative relationship might play a role in the observed performance of the Pse-N-MBBR, although their contribution in Pse-N-MBBR was obviouslylower than that in the N2-MBBR due to the lack of immobilization and poor hydrogen-production performance. A recent study suggests that the syntrophic associations between Clostridium sp. and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus sp. and Streptococcus sp.) enable Clostridium sp. to convert lactic acid and acetic acid into H2 and butyric acid (García-Depraect et al., 2019). A greater amount of butyric acid was detected in the fermentation products of the Pse-MBBR and the N2-MBBR, compared with the Pse-N-MBBR (Fig. 3c). This is likely due to the cooperative activities of Lactobacillus sp., Streptococcus sp. and Clostridium sp. that were not only responsible for residual oxygen abatement but also for generating more H2 and butyric acid through lactate-type fermentation. In order to have a deeper perspective on these microbial interactions, the dynamics of microbial communities in SIDO-MBBRs with operational time need to be further examined, and lactate profiles are needed in subsequent experiments to conduct an accurate and quantitative evaluation of lactate-type fermentation in SIDO-MBBRs."
13,Effects of influent pH on hydrogen production and stability in SIDO-MBBRs,"3.7 Effects of influent pH on hydrogen production and stability in SIDO-MBBRs pH is a critical factor in regulating dark fermentation, hydrogen production, and microbial community structures (Li et al., 2020; Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo, 2009). Fluctuation of reactor pH occurs as organic acids are produced by different microbes, which causes a feedback effect on microbial growth (García-Depraect et al., 2019). At the initial stage of operation, the pH of the three reactors declined rapidly from the influent pH 8 (Fig. 4d). After 3 days, the internal pH of the Pse-MBBR and the N2-MBBR gradually increased to a favorable range for microbial growth and metabolism, most probably because the addition of pre-immobilized biofilm carriers helped the cell biomass to resist the shock of fluctuating pH, while the pH value of the Pse-N-MBBR remained around 4.3. Previous studies have shown that pH can regulate the fermentation type exhibited in mixed cultures, and that the relatively high pH (>5.5) is more suited for the butyric acid-type and mixed acid-type fermentations whereas lower pH (4.0–4.5) is conducive to the establishment of ethanol-type fermentation (Li et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2007). Therefore, the higher pH of the Pse-MBBR and the N2-MBBR probably played a positive role in the enrichment of butyrate-type fermentative HPB and the stability of the SIDO-MBBRs. Further research should be performed to provide more information about the effects of pH on hydrogen production and community composition in SIDO-MBBRs."
14,Conclusions,"A SIDO strategy was coupled to an MBBR to shorten the start-up period and enhance H2 production. This approach substantially improved the hydrogen production and substrate conversion efficiencies of the MBBRs. A nitrogen flushed MBBR and a SIDO coupled MBBR produced more than two times hydrogen gas than an MBBR without pre-immobilization (Pse-N-MBBR). In addition, P. aeruginosa pre-immobilized MBBR (Pse-MBBR) enhanced H2 production rates and H2 yields in the early stage of operation, with cumulative hydrogen production reaching 88.93% of that achieved by the N2 sparged and pre-immobilized MBBR (N2-MBBR). The cumulative ethanol and butyric acid productions of SIDO-MBBRs were much higher than those of the Pse-N-MBBR. Enterobacter and Clostridium were the dominant populations in the microbial communities of all three reactors. The HPB were effectively enriched with the relative abundance of 82.82–96.56% in SIDO-MBBR. The results suggested that the SIDO-MBBR is effective for rapid recruitment of hydrogen-producing biofilms under micro-aerobic conditions and can shorten the start-up time of continuous-flow hydrogen-producing reactors."
