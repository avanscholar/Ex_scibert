0,Introduction,"Nitrobenzene (NB) as one of the most refractory pollutants in industrial wastewater posed a serious ecological hazard [1], being highly toxic and mutagenic potential to human health. Of late, many methods were reported to eliminate NB from contaminated water i.e. physical adsorption [2], advanced oxidation [3], reduction [4], and biodegradation [5], where reduction using stoichiometric reductant was an effective method that performed under mild condition. Aniline as the primary reduction product of NB showed less toxicity and more biodegradability [6], which was also an important intermediate in producing pigment, dyes, food additives, pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals. However, stoichiometric reduction using water gas or chemical H2 source as reductant often caused large amount of hazardous wastes and also serious pollution to environment [7]. Alternatively, selective hydrogenation reduction with molecular H2 gas was eco-friendly and cost-effective in converting NB into aniline [8], and the catalyst was a key point. To date, numerous heterogeneous catalyts have been developed using nobel metals i.e. Pd, Pt, Au or Ru as active center for nitroarenes hydrogenation [9,10], showing superior catalytic performance under mild condition. For instance, Pd-loaded carbon nanotubes had superior activity with turnover frequency (TOF) highly up to 66,900 h−1 and aniline selectivity up to 99% for NB hydrogenation [11]. However, high-cost and scarcity of nobel metals in earth would hinder their practical application, accompanying with the issue of over-reduction, leaching and poisoning due to super-active characteristics. Alternatively, the design of green catalysts based on earth-abundant transitional metals (i.e. Fe, Co and Ni) was highly desired from the points of low-cost and low toxicity, high stability, and ease of separation [12–14]. Metals with nano-scale sizes embedded in proper supports would be an ideal strategy for NB hydrogenation, not only to reduce the amounts of usage but also to improve their stability during the reaction because metal particle was often prone to sintering at high temperature. As a result, both active centers and supports were very critical for the catalytic performance, which was governed by the nature of interactions between metal centers and supports. Recently, carbons were widely used as supports for heterogeneous catalysts due to their characteristics of high surface areas, tunable pores, and functionalities [15], and N-doped carbons with mesopores and metals were convinced to be efficient catalysts for hydrogenation reduction [16–18]. For instance, Co-supported on N-doped carbons from carbonization of melamine, Co(NO3)2 and polyacrylonitrile had good activity in nitroarene reduction [12], and Co/mCN-900 sample with fluffy mesopores and rich N-species had a 100% conversion and 100% selectivity for NB hydrogenation into aniline under 120 °C and 1 MPa H2 with a TOF of 12.3. Yuan et al. [16] reported the production of Co@N-doped carbons from hydrothermal treatment of sucrose, melamine and Co(CH3COO)2 followed by carbonization, where Co-particles uniformly embedded in carbon network. Significantly, the as-obtained Co@NC-600 showed superir catalytic efficiency for transfer hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes using formic acid as the hydrogen donor [16]. In general, the presence of N-species would change electronic and charge mobility of carbon elements, leading to better distribution of active metals on the surface of carbons without serious agglomeration, which was useful to facilitate electron transfer to metals and then promote the adsorption and activation of H2 molecules [19]. The large enhancement from nitroarenes into anilines was ever observed for CoN co-doped carbons as compared to that of single N or Co-doped carbons under identical conditions, using molecular H2 gas as the reductant [14]. All the characteristics made great significance of carbons in liquid-phase hydrogenation [15]. For instance, S, N co-doped hierarchical carbons were ever reported as efficient metal-free catalysts from the carbonization of N, S-containing polymer precursor, showing high performance for the nitroarene reduction using hydrazine hydrate as hydrogen donor [20]. Though some types of metal-free carbons i.e. N-doped or P-doped nanotube were also reported as catalysts for NB hydrogenation using molecular H2 as the reductant [21,22], high conversion rate and selectivity was only observed as pressure larger than 3 MPa with reaction time extended up to 15 h. The conversion rate of NB was only of 60% with aniline selectivity of 90% even under condition of 170 °C and 4 MPa H2 pressure using N-doped carbon nanotubes as the catalyst [21], limiting large-scale industrial application at current stage. As a new class of crystalline materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) emerged as the templates or precursors to yield carbons [23,24], and zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) as a sub-family of MOF with imidazole ligands were popular to generate in-situ N-doped carbons on the use of water treatment or electrocatalysis [25–27]. The presence of Co-species in carbons originally from ZIF-67 also made them to be potential catalysts for hydrogenation reaction [23,28], showing high activity from synergistic effects between Co and N-species. For instance, N-doped carbons with Co/CoO particles were produced by ZIF-67 carbonization for nitroarenes reduction via in-situ generated H2 from tandem dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 [29], and the resulting Co-500-3 h catalysts with active centers of CoN structure and partial mesopores showed high chemical selectivity and magnetic recyclability for hydrogenation nitroarenes reduction. The defect engineering route was ever used to produce La-MOF for ring-opening polymerization of β-butyrolactone [30], in which the morphology of La-MOF varied from rod, baseball to nanosphere by adjusting the amount of 1-methylimidazole ligands, showing superior activity on the ring-opening reaction. However, the original MOF material directly used as the catalyst often showed an unsatisfied recycling performance. Recently, ZIF-67 powders with highly crystalline were also produced by a high-energy laser ablation technique via ablating Co targets in 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) solution [31]. The average size of ZIF-67 can be controlled by stoichiometric ratio of ligands to metal ions, and the shape of ZIF-67 can be precisely controlled by temperature and ablation time. After carbonization, the shape and particle size of ZIF-67 were believed to propose great effect on Co-included carbons, affecting catalytic performance on desired chemical transformation. Guo et al. [32] also reported the modulation of coordination environment in a hybrid MOF with varied ratios between ligands and metal source, and the in-situ produced Co-N3C structures in carbons would largely decrease free energy as compared with the conventional CoN4 and Co particles, boosting oxygen reduction performance as the catalysts. However, the precisely tuning size and shape of metal particles and electronic structure of carbons still remained a big challenge in hydrogenation reduction, and little focus was performed on the synergistic effects of metal particle size, hierarchical pores and N-species using N-doped carbons as supports. The existing N-species was widely demonstrated to be efficient to uniformly stabilize ultrafine metals, boosting activity of metal sites and also providing Lewis basic sites to facilitate adsorption of H2 molecules. Here, Co-species were in-situ encapsulated into N-doped carbons by the carbonization of ZIF-67 at 900 °C for 2 h, and the resulting catalysts showed excellent performance for liquid-phase NB hydrogenation into aniline under mild conditions (120 °C and 1 MPa H2). The structural characteristics of catalysts were studied, and molar ratio of ligand to metal source in ZIF-67 showed large effect on the distribution and particle size of Co-species on the surface of carbons, contributing to high activity and aniline selectivity. The general applicability of these catalysts for other nitro compounds was also investigated."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of ZIF-67 nanoparticles,"2.1 Preparation of ZIF-67 nanoparticles Preparation of ZIF-67 can be found elsewhere with modification [27,33], using 2-MIM and Co(NO3)2·6H2O as starting materials and CH3OH (99.8%) as solvent. A schematic illustration for production was shown in Scheme 1 , where 2-MIM (6.56 g, 8 mmol) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2.91 g, 1 mmol) dissolved in 40 mL methanol, followed by stirring at 30 °C for 24 h, and purple ZIF-67-8 powders were collected by centrifugation, washed by methanol and vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The analogous i.e. ZIF-67-4, ZIF-67-6 and ZIF-67-10 were also produced by similar steps with the varied molar ratio between 2-MIM and Co(NO3)2·6H2O of to be 4, 6 and 10, respectively."
3,Preparation of Co-NC-n catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of Co-NC-n catalysts N-doped carbons including Co-species (Co-NC-n) were obtained by in-situ ZIF-67 carbonization under N2 flow as presented in Scheme 1, where ZIF-67-n particles were placed in porcelain boat and carbonized at 900 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace, ramping of 4 °C/min. Before using Co-NC-n as the catalyst for NB hydrogenation, it was activated at 600 °C under H2 flow for 4 h to expose active sites and also reduce metal particle into possible single-atom outside the surface of carbons. As a control, NC-8 sample was also produced by treatment in 10% HF for 24 h to fully remove Co-species."
4,Procedure for the hydrogenation reaction,"2.3 Procedure for the hydrogenation reaction Hydrogenation was conducted in a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave, where 15 mg of catalyst, 150 mg NB, and 20 mL isopropyl alcohol were added, and air was removed via H2 purging using 1 MPa H2 for three times. Liquid solution was measured on a Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with Agilent HP-1NNOW AX capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm) and FID detector, and chlorobenzene was used as the internal standard. The NB conversion and aniline selectivity were calculated by internal standard method, and Co-NC-8 in solution was recovered with magnet and washed with ethanol to assess reusability. After vacuum-drying, catalyst was treated in H2 flow at 600 °C for 4 h for the next cycle, and Co-NC-8 was reused for at least seven runs."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were obtained on Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation as X-ray source with 2θ values ranging from 10 to 90°. Thermal analysis (TGA) was performed up to 900 °C on a METTLER TOLEDO Thermal Analysis System 1600HT. Microstructures were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6610LV) and transmission microscopy (TEM, Talos F200X). Porosity was evaluated by N2 isotherms at −196 °C on a Micrometrics TriStar II 3020 apparatus and surface areas were obtained by a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the element surrounding of catalysts. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was explored to measure the content of Co particles in catalyst."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physical structure of ZIF-67 precursors,"3.1 Physical structure of ZIF-67 precursors ZIF-67-n precursors with varied size were produced by a simple stirring method at room temperature, and the molar ratio of Co and MIM ligands were adjusted. The XRD patterns of ZIF-67-n and simulated ZIF-67 were listed in Fig. S1, and all peaks matched well with simulated ZIF-67 indexed from Crystallographic Information File (CIF) of the pure single crystal, confirming the construction of pure-phase ZIF-67-n [34]. The peaks at around 7.24, 10.32, 12.64, 17.94 and 26.85° were attributed to characteristic diffraction of (011), (002), (112), (222) and (134) plane for ZIF-67, respectively. Microstructures of ZIF-67-n were observed by SEM, and all particles in Fig. 1 had a rhombic dodecahedron structure with uniform size. Interestingly, the mean particle size for ZIF-67-n gradually decreased from 733 to 430 nm as the MIM/Co molar ratio varied from 4 to 10, resulting from the enhanced core sites for ZIF-67 nucleation with higher dispersion of Co caused by the excessive content of MIM ligand [31]. Thermal analysis of ZIF-67-8 was performed under N2 atmosphere and thermal behavior in Fig. S2 for ZIF-67-8 contained an obvious three-step decomposition process as temperature up to 900 °C. As temperature less than 480 °C, only small loss in weight was observed due to moisture evaporation outside the surface, indicating the superior stability of ZIF-67-n with high crystalline [31]. A main loss was observed in the range of 480–840 °C with sharp peak in derivative curve of 540 °C, indicating the formation of new carbonaceous phase from volatilization of organics and collapse of ZIF-67-8 skeleton. A small peak at 563 °C in derivative curve was probably due to the self-reduction of Co particles by the formed carbon materials. As temperature higher than 840 °C, the weight loss almost sluggished with formation of stable carbons, and residue in mass was of 20%. Then, a desired temperature of 900 °C was optimized for ZIF-67-n carbonization to produce Co-encapsuled carbons."
8,Physical structure of Co-NC-n catalysts,"3.2 Physical structure of Co-NC-n catalysts The conversion of ZIF-67-n into Co-NC-n catalysts was obtained by carbonization at 900 °C under N2 flow. As compared with XRD patterns for ZIF-67-n in Fig. S1, all peaks for ZIF-67-n disappeared and new peaks for Co particles appeared for Co-NC-n as shown in Fig. 2 , indicating the wholly collapse of ZIF-67 as carbonization occurred at 900 °C. These sharp peaks in Fig. 2 at around 44.2, 51.5, and 75.8° were attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes for the face-centered cubic Co materials [35], confirming the formation of metallic Co substance by self-reduction of carbon materials. The peaks for Co particles became weaker as an increase of MIM contents in the system, which also indicated the decrease of Co source. The broad weak peak at around 24° was attributed to the characteristic (002) plane for graphitic carbons. XRD results clearly indicated that the carbonization of ZIF-67-n at 900 °C resulted in the formation of graphitic carbons supported metallic Co particles. The morphology and microstructure of catalysts were evaluated by SEM and TEM method with results presented in Fig. 3 . It was evident that both Co-NC-4 and Co-NC-8 inherited original polyhedron shape of ZIF-67 matrix (Fig. 3), and carbonization did not destruct the structure. The degrees in shrinkage of particle size and roughness of surface were highly enhanced as more ligand used for the production of ZIF-67-n, indicating an excessive ligand would restrain crystal growth [27]. The particle size of Co-NC-4 was also larger than that of Co-NC-8 similar to the situation of ZIF-67-n, and no fracture existed in particles, although the surface was distorted. As shown in Fig. S3, the distribution size of Co particles in the carbon network were in a wide range of 20–100 nm with the main size of about 70 nm. It was clearly observed that partial of Co particles were embedded in the inner structure of carbons with slight agglomeration (Fig. 3d), and some graphitic carbon nanosheets were also formed by catalytic effect of Co-species [36]. It was not hard to infer that the presence of more ligands was efficient for Co dispersion, and Co ions can be better coordinated to produce ZIF-67-n. High-resolution TEM image in Fig. 3d indicated that the interplanar distance was gauged to be of about 0.2 nm for (111) plane of crystalline metallic Co, and distance of 0.34 nm was also observed for (002) plane of graphite [13], in good agreement with XRD patterns. All these results indicated that Co particles were partially encapsulated by graphitic layer, and metallic Co as active sites still exposed on the surface of carbons, which was believed to be useful for liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction with little metal leaching in the solution system. The N2 isotherms and pore size distributions (PSD) for catalysts were measured at −196 °C with results shown in Fig. 4 , and the detailed porous parameters were shown in Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 4, all isotherms were typical IV type with a small hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.45–1.0, indicating catalysts contained both micropores and mesopores in skeleton. The development of porosity was also observed for porous carbon materials from carbonization of ZIF-8 and glucose composites [27]. The N2 uptake sharply increased as P/P0 close to 1.0, indicating the presence of partial macropores probably from the shrinkage of pore wall during carbonization [33]. Pore size distributions determined by the density functional theory also supported the formation of hierarchical micro-, meso-, and macro-pores in the inner structure of catalysts (in Fig. 4b), where large majority of pores were located in the range of 2–4 nm and 30–70 nm. As shown in Table 1, the amounts of organic ligands applied for the production of ZIF-67-n precursors also affected the porosity of catalysts. Specifically, the BET surface areas of catalysts showed an increase trend as molar ratio of MIM/Co less than 8, while the further increase of MIM in ZIF-67-n would definitely lower surface areas. The lower surface areas of 141 m2/g for Co-NC-4 were caused by the lack of enough carbon source for the formation of catalysts, because more ligands would release more small molecules (e.g. H2O, NH3, and CO2) to produce pores during carbonization [28], while the lower surface areas (190 m2/g) for Co-NC-10 as compared to that Co-NC-8 was probably caused by the more serious shrinkage of pore walls [37]. Pore volumes of catalysts also exhibited a similar trend as shown in Table 1. As a result, the mesoporous feature of Co-NC-8 with large surface areas of 213 m2/g and average pore size of 6.53 nm was beneficial for substrates diffusion and adsorption and also expose more catalytic sites for liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction."
9,Surface structure of Co-NC-n catalysts,"3.3 Surface structure of Co-NC-n catalysts The survey curve for Co-NC-8 as an example in Fig. S4 included a pronounced C1s peak and three weak peaks for O1s, N1s and Co2p. XPS results revealed the presence of C, O, N, and Co in Co-NC-8 with atomic ratio of 89.59, 6.06, 1.57, and 2.78 at.%, that is 12.06 wt% of Co in skeleton. The detailed element content from XPS result and bulk content for Co-species from ICP-AES were shown in Table S1, where XPS results were largely lower than that of bulk results i.e. 41.64 wt% of Co for Co-NC-8. Considering the surface sensitive of XPS method, Co particles were indeed encapsulated in the inner structure with partially distribution on the surface [33]. C1s XPS spectra in Fig. S4 can be resolved into three peaks at 284.7, 285.5, and 286.8 eV, attributing to C-C/C=C, CN, and CO, respectively [36]. The presence of CN peak indicated that partial N-species from ZIF-67-n backbone preserved after carbonization [27]. As shown in Fig. 5 , deconvolution for all N1s spectra included three N-species at 398.6, 400.1, and 401.4 eV, attributing to pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic-N, respectively [28,32]. The detailed composition for three types of N-species was listed in Fig. S5, and the content of graphitic-N was much higher than that of other N-species from the catalytic effect of Co in carbon matrix, and among them Co-NC-8 contained the highest graphitic-N. The forms of Co particles in catalysts included Co(0) and CoOx with satellite peak as revealed by Co2p spectra in Fig. 6 using Co-NC-4 and Co-NC-10 as examples, where two broad peaks at 780.6 and 796.9 eV were separately due to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 [38]. It was obvious that both Co2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks showed moderate shift as an increase of ligands used for ZIF-67-n precursor. More specifically, binding energies at 780.3 and 781.5 eV in high-resolution Co2p3/2 peaks were separately owned to Co(0) and Co-Ox [39]. The intense signal in Co(0) peak confirmed high crystallinity of Co particles, and some Co particles exposed on the surface of catalyst transformed from CoOx due to reduction effect of carbon matrix [21,40]. Considering no diffractions for CoO were observed in XRD patterns for Co-NC-n catalysts (Fig. 2), the presence of CoOx peaks was probably owned to partial oxidation of the surface of metallic Co. All the functionalities were believed to facilitate H2 dissociation in the following hydrogenation reaction."
10,Nitrobenzene hydrogenation over Co-NC-n catalysts,"3.4 Nitrobenzene hydrogenation over Co-NC-n catalysts Liquid-phase NB hydrogenation into aniline was used to evaluate catalysts under condition of 120 °C and 1 MPa H2 pressure for 4 h. As shown in Table 2 , hydrogenation could not be achieved in the presence of pure ZIF-67-8 or without catalyst (Entries 1–2), and NC-8 without Co particles also showed limited NB conversion of 10% (Entry 3). As comparison, all Co-NC-n catalysts produced by ZIF-67-n carbonization indeed showed catalytic performance with NB conversion in the range of 50–100%, and Co-NC-8 even showed full conversion with 99% yield of aniline (Entry 6), probably correlating to high surface areas and high ratio of hierarchical meso-macropores. The large surface areas of 200 m2/g and small particle size of Co-CN-8 would also expose more active sites on the surface, accelerating H2 dissociation to participate in hydrogenation reaction [40]. It should be noted that no activity was observed as H2 pressure lower than 2 MPa at 170 °C over N-doped carbon nanotubes in previous work [21], and the NB conversion was only of 60% with 91% selectivity even as pressure up to 4 MPa for 10 h at 170 °C. All these results indicated that the presence of appropriate Co-species in carbons was benefit to catalytic performance under mild conditions, and the excessive metal loading was not conducive to the selective NB hydrogenation into aniline. Effects of time, temperature, and H2 pressure for NB hydrogenation over Co-NC-8 were evaluated to optimize the condition. It should be stated that the content of catalysts was of 15 mg and substrate was of 150 mg, because NB conversion decreased to 86% as substrate/catalyst ratio larger than 10. As presented in Fig. 7 , the longer time, higher H2 pressure and temperature promoted conversion, and NB conversion was enhanced from 20% to 86% as reaction time extended from 0.5 to 1.5 h under conditions of 120 °C and 1 MPa H2 pressure (Fig. 7a). Importantly, NB could be fully converted into aniline under conditions of 2.5 h, 120 °C and H2 pressure larger than 0.9 MPa, and a 100% selectivity retained in the entire period because aniline was the only product in hydrogenation. All these phenomena confirmed superiority of Co-NC-8 as catalyst for NB hydrogenation to produce aniline with best conditions of 120 °C, 3 h, and 1 MPa H2 pressure. In general, two routes were widely accepted for NB hydrogenation [21,41], one path was reduction via nitroso and hydroxylamine intermediates, and the other involved the azo intermediate of azobenzene-p-aniline and azobenzene. Based on the results via GC method, a possible path for NB hydrogenation over Co-NC-8 was proposed as shown in Fig. 7d. Typically, H2 molecules were adsorbed on Co-Nx active sites of Co-NC-8 and dissociated into two hydrogens. The produced H-species reacted with nitro group to form nitroso compound, and nitroso group combined with H-species to form phenylhydroxylamine intermediate. Then, phenylhydroxylamine was again reduced by adsorbed H2 to form aniline followed by the desorption into solution to produce final product [36]. During the process, Co-NC-8 catalyst featured hierarchical micro-mesopores would benefit for the transportation of substrates, intermediates, and products. A variety of substituted nitroarenes was also used as the substrates under identical condition to explore possible universality of Co-NC-8. As shown in Table 3 , Co-NC-8 exhibited good performance for most halogenated NB with conversion and selectivity larger than 80% (Entry 1–5), while o-chloronitrobenzene conversion was only of 64.3% (Entry 1). The selectivity for bromine and fluoronitrobenzene to aniline counterpart was larger than 99% without obvious dehalogenation. Selectivity was lowered to be 85% for p-chloronitrobenzene (Entry 2), and a certain amount of dechlorination occurred. It was widely reported that Pd-incorporated carbons often caused a wholly dehalogenation due to excessive activity [42]. Co-NC-8 as non-noble metal catalyst was a good choice for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated aromatic nitro compound. As shown in Table 3, Co-NC-8 also showed high conversion and selectivity for methyl substituents to aniline counterparts (Entry 6–8), while the conversion for hydroxyarylnitro groups was of only 65.4% (Entry 9). The electron-withdrawing groups i.e. halogens and -OH showed lower conversion as compared to that of substrate with electron-donating groups i.e. -CH3 [28,33]. The hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene over Co-CN-8 also showed unsatisfactory activity with conversion of 48% (Entry 10), and 3-aminostyrene selectivity was of 71.2% with 3-ethylaniline as a main byproduct. The relative low activity was probably due to steric hindrance effects and unstable CC bond [40], and the cleavage and hydrogenation of CC would automatically occur after hydrogenating nitro groups. The stability and recyclability of Co-NC-8 for NB hydrogenation were evaluated under the optimal condition. After each reaction, catalyst can be magnetically recovered and then reused after simple reduction by H2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 8 , Co-NC-8 as catalyst showed NB conversion larger than 99% under the conditions of 120 °C and 1 MPa H2 pressure for 3 h, and such high activity can be maintained in the first three cycles. Significantly, NB conversion still remained above 80% for the next four cycles, and XRD patterns for the used Co-NC-8 catalyst after 7 cycles in Fig. S6 changed a little as compared to that of fresh one only with slightly reduction in intensity. The decrease in conversion was due to Co-NC-8 deactivation from Co-species leaching into solution, and also insufficient oxidation and followed reduction of Co-Nx active sites [28]. As comparison, Co-NC-8 also directly reused for NB hydrogenation after recovering with magnet separation and vacuum-dried without H2 reduction. As shown in Fig. S7, the NB conversion dropped sharply from the second to fourth cycle with the value of only 17%. All the above results further confirmed that Co-species in Co-NC-8 would be partially oxidized during the hydrogenation of NB, resulting in a sharp decline in catalytic performance."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, ZIF-67-n precursors were obtained by changing molar ratio between Co salt and MIM ligands. CoN co-doped carbons with varied sizes were produced by in-situ carbonization of ZIF-67-n and used as catalysts for NB hydrogenation. Among them, the as-made Co-NC-8 showed the best catalytic activity under mild conditions of 120 °C and 1 MPa H2 pressure for 3 h, resulting from synergistic effects of large surface areas and also metallic Co, Co-Nx and CoOx, which can be recycled for 6 times without evident activity loss. Significantly, Co-NC-8 also had high activity for hydrogenation of other aromatic nitro compounds. The excellent stability for Co-NC-8 may be caused by well-confined Co-Nx active sites in skeletons, protecting Co-species from leaching and agglomeration during the reaction. The reported synthetic method via modulating molar ratio between metals and ligands could be applicable to produce carbons with amazing active structure from non-precious metals, boosting catalytic efficiency in selective NB hydrogenation and many other reactions."
