0,Introduction,"Energy is one of the main pillars of modern civilization, and it is indispensable in social life. However, with the rapid development of human society and the awareness of environmental protection, the non-renewable energy sources such as coal and oil are increasingly lacking, and the air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels is becoming increasingly prominent [1,2]. The world is up against the dual crisis of fossil fuel depletion and environmental deterioration. The search for sustainable and environment-friendly alternative fuels has become a pressing issue [3]. The biofuels have been considered viable alternative energy. Biodiesel, a renewable and environment-friendly biofuel that originated from vegetable oil and animal fat, is a promising substitute for diesel fuel [4,5]. Jatropha oil is non-edible vegetable oil, which is a good raw material for biodiesel production [6,7]. However, because of the triglycerides of unsaturated fatty acids contained in feedstock of Jatropha oil, Jatropha oil biodiesel generally has relatively high content of polyunsaturated fatty acid methanol esters (polyunsaturated FAMEs), which are the needless compositions for gaining biodiesel with ideal compositions of monounsaturated FAMEs. To upgrade Jatropha oil biodiesel, namely to increase the low-temperature fluidity and improve the oxidation property of biodiesel, the selective hydrogenation of Jatropha oil biodiesel becomes an important process to change polyunsaturated FAMEs into monounsaturated FAMEs. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is a promising technology to hydrogenate organics selectively [8–11]. In comparison with conventional hydrogenation in which using explosive hydrogen gas, CTH utilizing molecular hydrogen as the hydrogen donor is a simple, safe and eco-friendly method of hydrogenation. CTH reactions of vegetable oils or grease-like materials catalyzed by noble metal have been widely reported in literature [12–15]. Martinelli et al. investigated the CTH of castor oil using limonene as hydrogen donor and Pd/C as catalyst [13] Sancheti and Gogate investigated the CTH of soybean oil with Pd/C catalyst under ultrasound, and it was found that the CTH of soybean oil progressed effectively [14]. Although the noble metal catalysts have excellent catalyst performance in CTH, the widespread use of metal catalysts in industry is limited due to the high cost. Furthermore, CTH process generally demands long reaction time and high reaction temperature [16,17]. Therefore, the strengthening of CTH process under the condition of inexpensive catalysts is very important for the upgrading of Jatropha oil biodiesel. Microwave, as a transmitted medium and heated energy, can accelerate the reaction rate and improve the selectivity of chemical reaction [18–20]. Zhang et al. studied the isothermal kinetics of leaching indium from indium-bearing materials under microwave heating, and it was found that the leaching rate has been significantly accelerated by microwave [19]. Lin et al. reported the Jatropha oil biodiesel production with microwave heating system, which improved the Jatropha oil biodiesel yields [20]. In our previous work [21], using Raney-Ni as catalyst and under microwave irradiation, isothermal hydrogenation of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant temperature, which was successfully controlled by changing microwave power through PID controller, has been studied. It should be noted that, as mentioned above, the reaction under microwave irradiation was mainly studied under the condition of constant temperature. However, besides temperature, microwave intensity also has an important effect on the reaction. Microwave intensity, which can be directly reflected by microwave power, is the key to understanding the microwave enhancement effect on the reaction. Hence, microwave-assisted CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant microwave power is needed to study in detail. Moreover, the heating process of reaction system might be a long-running and non-isothermal process at constant microwave power. However, adequate studies have not been reported on the non-isothermal kinetics involved in hydrogenation of oils and fats. Thus, a new method to establish the non-isothermal kinetics is also needed, which would help to analyze the effect of microwave intensity on the reaction. In present work, with different levels of constant microwave power, the effects of catalyst dosage, microwave power, water quantity, isopropyl alcohol amount and stirring speed on the CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel have been studied. And then, non-isothermal kinetics happened in the reaction system at constant microwave power has been established, and the verification of non-isothermal kinetics has been presented. Lastly, the effects of microwave intensity on reaction rate and selectivity of CTH were investigated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Jatropha oil biodiesel was obtained by the transesterification method as already reported [22]. The compositions of Jatropha oil biodiesel are shown in Table 1 [21]. Raney-Ni (diameter less than 0.1 mm) was obtained from Raney metal technology Ltd., Jiangsu, China. Isopropyl alcohol was analytical grade."
3,CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant microwave power,"2.2 CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant microwave power Jatropha oil biodiesel (7 g), isopropyl alcohol, water, and Raney-Ni catalyst were taken in a three-necked flask. And then the flask was placed in a microwave reactor (MCR-3; Shijishuangke experimental instrument co., Led, Zhengzhou, China) with a temperature sensor and a motor-driven Teflon stirring rod. The reaction device diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In this study, different levels of microwave power, ranging from 50 to 250 W, were used to investigate the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant microwave power. Furthermore, with reference to the results of previous work from our laboratory [21], the CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant microwave power was carried out with catalyst dosage from 6 to 14 wt% of biodiesel, isopropyl alcohol amount from 16 to 48 g, water quantity from 60 to 140 g, and stirring speed from 200 to 600 rpm."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The Jatropha oil biodiesel compositions and upgraded biodiesel compositions were determined using GC according to the method of our previous work [21]. The unsaturation degree of biodiesel was determined by iodine value (IV, g indine/100 g oil) with Wijs method [23]. In the work, all the biodiesel samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the average value was used as the final data (the experimental standard deviation was less than 5%)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of operating parameters in microwave heating system of constant microwave power,"3.1 Effects of operating parameters in microwave heating system of constant microwave power 3.1.1 Effect of catalyst loading on CTH at constant microwave power The dosage of catalyst was of key importance to the chemical reaction [14]. The effect of catalyst loading on the CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel was investigated at a constant microwave power of 150 W under the condition as follows: isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water quantity 80 g, stirring speed 400 rpm, and reaction time 30 min. The results are represented in Fig. 2 . It was observed that with the increase of catalyst loading, the content of C18:2 significantly reduced. Compared with the initial C18:2 content of Jatropha oil biodiesel (30.5 wt%), the C18:2 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 12 wt% decreased to 6.2 wt%, and the C18:2 content catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 14 wt% further decreased to 3.6 wt%. However, even though the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 14 wt% had the lowest content of C18:2 composition, the cis-18:1 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 12 wt% (50.3 wt%) was significantly larger than the cis-18:1 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 14 wt% (43.1 wt%). Compared with the trans-methyl oleate (trans-C18:1) content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel (24.9 wt%) catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 12 wt%, the trans-C18:1 content catalyzed at the catalyst loading of 14 wt% increased to 30.6 wt%. The changes in cis-C18:1 and trans-C18:1 contents, as mentioned above, indicated that the transformation of cis-C18:1 to trans-C18:1 occurred under the high catalyst loading, which is an adverse reaction to gain an upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel of fine composites [21,24]. Moreover, it was observed from Fig. 2(b) that the IV of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel was progressively declined with the increase of catalyst dosage, demonstrating that the unsaturation degree of biodiesel declined [14]. The conversion ratio of C18:2 (CR C182) reached 79.7 wt% and 88.2 wt% at the catalyst loading of 12 wt% and 14 wt%, respectively. However, compared with the ratio of generated C18:0 to total (R C180) at the catalyst loading of 12 wt% (20.0 wt%), the ratio at the catalyst loading of 14 wt% increased to 35.7 wt%, indicating that deep hydrogenation of methyl oleate to methyl stearate had obviously occurred at the high catalyst loading. The inference of deep hydrogenation of methyl oleate at high catalyst loading also could be further proved by the change of C18:0 content with the increase of catalyst loading. It was observed from Fig. 2(a) that the C18:0 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel almost remained unchanged with the increase of catalyst loading from 6 wt% to 12 wt%. However, when the catalyst loading increased to 14 wt%, the C18:0 content showed a significant increase and reached 9.7 wt%. In order to ensure the content of C18:0 and trans-C18:1 in upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel as little as possible, 12 wt% of catalyst loading was considered as the appropriate condition and used in the further CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel. 3.1.2 Effect of microwave power on CTH The effects of microwave power on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel are shown in Fig. 3 . The hydrogenation of biodiesel was carried out with catalyst loading 12 wt%, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, water quantity 80 g, stirring speed 400 rpm, and reaction time 30 min. As shown in Fig. 3, the C18:2 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel decreased obviously with the increase of microwave power from 50 W to 150 W. When the microwave power was 150 W, the C18:2 content was 6.2 wt%. However, with the further increase of microwave power (>150 W), both the contents of C18:2 and cis-C18:1 in upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel almost remained unchanged. Moreover, the IV was gradually decreased until microwave power was 150 W, and the CR C18:2 also reached its minimum at the microwave power of 150 W, indicating that the minimum level of unsaturation degree of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel gained at microwave power 150 W. Therefore, 150 W microwave power was chosen as the optimal condition. 3.1.3 Effect of isopropyl alcohol amount on CTH The hydrogen donor is a key factor in CTH reaction, and it is reported that secondary alcohols are effective hydrogen donors [25,26]. Isopropyl alcohol, as common secondary alcohol, is easy to obtain and is usually chosen as donor in CTH reactions. The experiment without isopropyl alcohol has been studied in our previous work, and it was found that the water could provide hydrogen to some extent during the CTH of biodiesel [27]. However, the hydrogen supply by water was much weaker than isopropyl alcohol in the reaction system of CTH of biodiesel. Thus, isopropyl alcohol was the main hydrogen donor during the CTH of biodiesel. Under the condition of constant microwave power, the effect of isopropyl alcohol amount on the CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel was studied with catalyst loading 12 wt%, water quantity 80 g, stirring speed 400 rpm, microwave power 150 W, and reaction time 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4 , with the increase of isopropyl alcohol amount, the C18:2 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel obviously decreased. When the isopropyl alcohol amounts were 40 g and 48 g, no C18:2 composition was detected in the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel. The result demonstrated that in the range of isopropyl alcohol amount ≥40 g, all the C18:2 composition in the initial biodiesel has been successfully hydrogenated and completely converted into the C18 compositions of high saturation via the microwave-assisted CTH. It was also found that there was no difference in the cis-C18:1 content between the biodiesels prepared respectively at isopropyl alcohol amount 16 g and at 24 g. However, the cis-C18:1 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel declined rapidly when the amount of isopropyl alcohol was over 24 g, and meanwhile, both the contents of trans-C18:1 and C18:0 showed a significant rising trend. Furthermore, considering the gradual declination of IV in the range of isopropyl alcohol amount from 16 g to 24 g, it could be safely concluded that at a high isopropyl alcohol amount (>24 g), a significant quantity of cis-C18:1 composition could change into the compositions of trans-C18:1 and/or C18:0. In order to inhibit the loss of cis-C18:1 and the excessive generations of trans-C18:1 and C18:0, 24 g was considered as the optimum amount of isopropyl alcohol and used in the further CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel. 3.1.4 Effect of water quantity on CTH Water, as an inexpensive and readily available green solvent, is an important method for developing green chemical production. Moreover, water as a good microwave absorbing material has been widely used as the solvent in many microwave-assisted reactions [28–31]. The effect of water quantity on the CTH of Jatropha oil biodiesel was studied under the conditions of catalyst loading 12 wt%, stirring speed 400 rpm, microwave power 150 W, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, and reaction time 30 min. As shown in Fig. 5 , both at water quantity of 60 g and at 80 g, the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesels had a relatively low content of C18:2 composition, and the CR C18:2 was about 80 wt%. However, when water quantity was over 80 g, there was an obvious rise in the C18:2 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesels, indicating that too high water quantity had a negative effect on the hydrogenation of C18:2. Under high water quantity, the dilution of reactants of isopropyl alcohol and biodiesels would happen, and low availability of donors and receptors on the catalyst surface came into being because of their low adsorption on the active sites of catalyst. Moreover, it was observed that compared with that of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel prepared at water quantity of 60 g, the cis-C18:1 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel prepared at water quantity of 80 g significantly increased. With the further increase of water quantity from 80 g to 140 g, the cis-C18:1 content of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel prepared at different water quantity nearly kept a constant value, which was equal to the content value of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel prepared at the water quantity of 80 g. The results showed that increasing water quantity could avoid the transformation of cis-C18:1 to trans-C18:1. Moreover, in view of almost no changes of C18:0 content and minor fluctuation of R C180, it was found that in the range over 80 g, the water quantity had almost no influence on the deep hydrogenation of C18:0 generation. At the water quantity of 60 g, the IV of upgraded biodiesel decreased from ca. 97.08 of Jatropha oil biodiesel to ca. 80.39, and it was kept almost unchanged for upgraded biodiesel obtained at the water quantity of 80 g. However, the IV suddenly dropped to ca. 62.82 at the water quantity of 100 g, and it only showed tiny changes in the water quantity range from 100 g to 140 g, indicating that the unsaturation degree of upgraded biodiesel almost did not change. Based on the results mentioned above, it was found that when using a suitable amount of water in microwave-assisted CTH system, the high conversion ratio of C18:2 could be obtained with appropriate contents of trans-C18:1 and C18:0 in upgraded biodiesel. Therefore, 80 g was considered as the optimal condition of water quantity. 3.1.5 Effect of stirring speed on CTH The effects of stirring speed on the CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel are shown in Fig. 6 . The hydrogenation of biodiesel was carried out under the conditions as follows: catalyst loading 12 wt%, isopropyl alcohol amount 24 g, microwave power 150 W, water quantity 80 g, and reaction time 30 min. The CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel was a heterogeneous system (immiscible liquids and solid catalyst) [15]. The transport and diffusion of Jatropha oil biodiesel and isopropyl alcohol to the active catalyst center depended upon the turbulence intensity of liquid-phase [15]. The stirring speed decides the intensity of turbulence, and the increase of stirring speed can eliminate the external diffusion, which is favorable for heterogeneous reaction. As shown in Fig. 6, the contents of C18:2, trans-C18:1, cis-C18:1and C18:0 almost remained unchanged in the range of stirring speed from 200 to 600 rpm. Furthermore, the conversion ratio of C18:2, the ratio of generated C18:0 and the IV only showed a slight change in the stirring speed range of 200–600 rpm. The results indicated that the influence from the external diffusion was eliminated even at the stirring speed of 200 rpm. Accordingly, 200 rpm was chosen as the optimal condition of stirring speed."
7,Non-isothermal kinetics of CTH at constant microwave power,"3.2 Non-isothermal kinetics of CTH at constant microwave power 3.2.1 Non-isothermal kinetics at the microwave power of 50 W and at 75 W The temperature changes of reaction system with heating time under different microwave powers are shown in Fig. 7 . It was observed that the temperature under the microwave power of 50 W and under 75 W showed sustainable growth with time in 50 min and in 40 min, respectively. However, under high microwave power, the temperature of reaction system quickly increased and then kept constant with the further increase of heating time. As shown in Fig. 7, under 100 W and under 150 W, the reaction system under microwave heating changed into an isothermal state after 15 min and after 8 min, respectively. Considering this result, the kinetic parameters of non-isothermal kinetics at 50 W and 75 W were investigated. Jatropha oil biodiesel contained saturated and unsaturated FAMEs. During hydrogenating, the unsaturated FAMEs could be progressively transformed into the high saturated FAMEs. However, hydroisomerization reaction occurred during the hydrogenation of Jatropha oil biodiesel, and the isomer of scis-C18:1 and trans-C18:1 could be formed from the hydrogenation of C18:2. For simplicity of dynamic analysis, cis-C18:1 and trans-C18:1 were treated as a whole without further distinction. Namely, polyunsaturated FAMEs (C18:1) was used in kinetic description [15,32]. Thus, the CTH reaction process of biodiesel can be represented as a series reaction as follows [15]: (1) C18:2 → k 1 C18:1 → k 2 C18:0 where k 1 indicates reaction rate parameter for C18:2 to C18:1 (min−1), k 2 indicates reaction rate parameter for C18:1 to C18:0 (min−1). The composition changes of Jatropha biodiesel during the CTH reaction at microwave power 50 W and at microwave power 75 W are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 , respectively. In view of the change of upgraded biodiesel composition depending on both time and temperature in non-isothermal process, attempts were made to develop the content of composition as a function of time (t) and temperature (T), as expressed by Eq. (2): (2) c i = f t , T i = 1 , 2 , 3 where c 1 indicates content of C18:2 (wt.%), c 2 indicates content of C18:1 (wt.%), and c 3 indicates content of C18:0 (wt.%). As for a binary function z = f(u, v), if both u and v are unary functions with respect to x, the function z can be regarded as a unary function with respect to x. As shown in Fig. 7, for the non-isothermal process under the microwave heating system, there was truly a unary function relationship between the reaction temperature T and the reaction time t at the constant microwave power. Hence, Eq. (2) could be simplified to a unary function of content with respect to time, as shown in Eq. (3): (3) c i = f ′ t To depict the non-isothermal kinetics of hydrogenation, all reaction steps in Eq. (2) were considered to be irreversible and first order with respect to substrate [15]. Furthermore, in order to simplify the data processing, C18:1 was chosen as the whole target substance to explore the kinetics at a constant microwave power. Moreover, as presented in Section 3.1.5, the interparticle mass transfer resistance has been eliminated by rapid stirring. Therefore, the equations of reaction rate were depicted in Eqs. (4)–(6): (4) d c 1 d t = - k 1 c 1 (5) d c 3 d t = k 2 c 2 (6) d c 2 d t = - k 2 c 2 + k 1 c 1 In an infinitesimal time, the CTH of biodiesel at a constant microwave power could be considered to be an isothermal process. Hence, d c i dt efined by Eqs. (4)–(6) represented the reaction rate of C18:i under the instantaneous reaction temperature. Using the data in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 (corresponding to the microwave power 50 W and 75 W, respectively), the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2 at different time were calculated. The rate parameters are listed in Table 2 . It could be seen that, at the same reaction time, the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2 at 50 W were lower than those at 75 W. This was due to the fact that microwave can speed up the reaction rate [18–20], and the intensifying effect from microwave is more pronounced at the higher microwave power. Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the values of k 1 and k 2 both decreased with time at the constant microwave power of 50 W or 75 W. For the non-isothermal processes at microwave power of 50 W and at 75 W, the temperature of CTH system truly increased with time, as shown in Fig. 7. Hence, in the non-isothermal process of CTH of biodiesel at a constant microwave power, the value of rate parameter decreased with the increasing temperature, which was different from the result found in the isothermal process. In the isothermal kinetics of CTH of biodiesel, the value of rate parameter increased with increasing temperature [21]. The rate parameter in the non-isothermal process was truly connected to the instantaneous rate of reaction, and the rate parameter was calculated by dividing the reaction rate of d c i dt y the concentration ci . In other words, rate parameter for non-isothermal process was at special time point, and had a direct connection with instantaneous reaction rate and instantaneous concentration. Under the condition of constant microwave power, the reaction tended to balance with reaction time. At high temperature in the non-isothermal process (corresponding to the long reaction time at constant microwave power), even though the concentration changed little, the reaction rate significantly declined, which could be confirmed by the changing trend of composition concentration with time in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Thus, in the non-isothermal processes at 50 W and at 75 W, the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2 both decreased with the prolonging time, and meanwhile, with the increasing temperature."
8,2 Verification of non-isothermal kinetics at the microwave power of 50 W and at 75 W,"3.3 2 Verification of non-isothermal kinetics at the microwave power of 50 W and at 75 W As shown in Fig. 7, for the reaction system under 50 W, the system temperature of 65, 70, 75 and 80 °C was corresponding to the reaction time of 17, 20, 27 and 38 min, respectively; and for the reaction system under 75 W, the system temperature of 65, 70, 75 and 80 °C was corresponding to the reaction time of 13, 15, 18 and 22 min, respectively. In non-isothermal kinetics studies, it was found that the rate parameter varied with reaction time at the same microwave power, and the rate parameter had a certain relationship with the reaction time. The relationship between kinetic constant and reaction time was fitted. The fitting results at the microwave power of 50 W and at 75 W are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 , respectively. It was seen that there was a linear relation between kinetic constant and reaction time. Using the fitting equations of kinetic constant with respect to time, non-isothermal kinetics equations, corresponding to Eqs. (4)–(6), at the microwave power of 50 W and at 75 W were obtained (Table 3 ). To prove the accurateness of kinetic constant calculated for the non-isothermal kinetics, the composition contents of C18 FAMEs at different reaction time, corresponding to reaction temperature 65, 70, 75 and 80 °C, respectively, were firstly calculated using the non-isothermal kinetics equations (Table 3). The actual composition contents of C18 FAMEs corresponding to reaction temperature 65, 70, 75 and 80 °C, respectively, were also determined. The results of the calculated contents of composition and the actual content obtained in this work are represented in Fig. 12 . The sum of residuals (RSS) was used to represent the deviation between the experimental and the predicted contents of C18 FAMEs. The results of RSS values for different compositions at 50 W and at 75 W are presented in Table 4 . It was observed that the deviation between the experimental and the predicted content was within a reasonable range. Therefore, it was concluded that under constant microwave power, the rate parameters of non-isothermal kinetics calculated by this method were credible."
9,Effect of different microwave power on selectivity of C18:1 production,"3.4 Effect of different microwave power on selectivity of C18:1 production 3.4.1 Isothermal kinetics at the microwave power of 100 W and at 150 W The composition changes of Jatropha biodiesel during the CTH reaction at microwave power of 100 W and at microwave power of 150 W are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 , respectively. In view of the quick increase of temperature to a constant value in short time, it was difficult to obtain kinetic parameters of non-isothermal state at the microwave power of 100 W and at 150 W. However, the isothermal kinetic parameters, reflecting the reaction process at 100 W and at 150 W, were calculated according to the reported method whose accuracy has been verified [15,22]. The kinetic parameters at 100 W and at 150 W are presented in Table 5 . When the reaction temperature was 85.2 °C at the microwave power of 100 W, the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2 were 0.032 and 0.0008, respectively. However, when the reaction temperature was 85.7 °C at 150 W, the rate parameters of k 1 and k 2 were 0.076 and 0.00013, respectively. It was observed that the temperature of reaction system at 100 W was almost equal to the temperature at 150 W, but the rate parameters at two microwave powers were quite different, which was indicative of significant contribution from the non-thermal effect of microwave. [33,34] The significant increase of rate parameter at the microwave power of 150 W indicated that the non-thermal effect from microwave truly played an important role in strengthening CTH reaction which was carried out under microwave heating. 3.4.2 Effect of different microwave power on selectivity The hydrogenation selectivity of CTH is an important parameter to evaluate the catalytic upgrading of biodiesel. As the CTH reaction of biodiesel was a series reaction (as shown in Eq. (1)), the hydrogenation selectivity could be calculated using the ratio of rate parameters, according to Eq. (7) [15,22]. (7) S = k 1 k 2 where S indicates the selectivity of C18:1 production. The selectivity of C18:1 production under different microwave power is listed in Table 6 . It was seen that with the microwave power increase, the selectivity of C18:1 production obviously increased, indicating that the increase of hydrogenation rate of C18:2 to C18:1 was obviously more than that of C18:1 to C18:0 under higher microwave power. As non-thermal effect from microwave had a positive effect on the CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel, the increase in the selectivity of C18:1 production at high microwave power indicated that the non-thermal effect had a higher positive effect on the hydrogenation reaction of C18:2 to C18:1 than on the hydrogenation reaction of C18:1 to C18:0."
10,Properties of the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel,"3.5 Properties of the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel The biodiesel properties are dependent on the structural features (chain length, degree of saturation and branching of the chain) of FAMEs. Jatropha oil biodiesel with a high content of polyunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2) is the major cause of low oxidative stability of Jatropha oil biodiesel, which would make Jatropha oil biodiesel more susceptible to the oxidative deterioration and reduce the shelf life of biodiesel. The content of C18:2 in upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel finally decreased from 30.53 wt% of Jatropha oil biodiesel to 2.74 wt%, meaning that the oxidative stability of Jatropha oil biodiesel has been significantly improved. Moreover, biodiesel with a high content of C18:0, for the high melting points (39 °C) of C18:0, would have a poor cold flow property. The selectivity of C18:1 production obviously increased in higher microwave power, and the content of C18:0 in the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel only showed a slight increase to 8.33 wt% from 6.06 wt% of Jatropha oil biodiesel. In order to more clearly show the various properties of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel, the main quality indexes, including IV, cetane number (CN), cold filter plugging point (CFPP), cloud point (CP), pour point (PP), oxidation stability (OS), kinematic viscosity (υ) and density (ρ), were estimated using “BiodieselAnalyzer© Ver. 2.2 (available on ”http://www.brteam.ir/biodieselanalyzer“) [35]. The result is shown in Table 7 . CN measures the ignition performance of biodiesel. Compared with the CN value of Jatropha oil biodiesel (50.58), the CN value of hydrogenated biodiesel was 56.55, which met the minimum requirement of the biodiesel standards of GB 25199–2017 and EN 14,214 (51/49 and 51, respectively). CP, PP and CFPP represent the cold flow property of biodiesel. The values of CP, CFPP were 1.37 and 0.41, respectively, and the value of PP of upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel was below zero. Low freezing points of biodiesel could be used in the cold climate condition. The Jatropha oil biodiesel had a low OS value (6.45 h). However, the value of OS for the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel was 45.63 h. The result indicated that the antioxidative property of Jatropha oil biodiesel has been significantly improved after CTH reaction, and the ungraded Jatropha oil biodiesel held an excellent antioxidative behavior. In short, the upgraded Jatropha oil biodiesel properties fulfilled the Chinese and European standards."
11,Conclusions,"Microwave-assisted CTH reaction of Jatropha oil biodiesel at constant microwave power was successfully performed in the present work. The effects of operating parameters in the microwave heating system of constant microwave power on the CTH reaction of biodiesel have been investigated. The CTH reaction of biodiesel showed a non-isothermal process at low microwave power, and mainly appeared an isothermal process at high microwave power. The CTH reaction of biodiesel at constant microwave power, including non-isothermal process and isothermal process, could be well described by pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The kinetic rate constants and the selectivity of C18:1 production of CTH, including isothermal or non-isothermal state, were gained. It was founded that the non-thermal effect from microwave played an important role in strengthening CTH reaction, and had a higher positive effect on the hydrogenation reaction of C18:2 to C18:1 than on the hydrogenation reaction of C18:1 to C18:0. Future work should focus on the cost-benefit analysis in CTH processes heated by the method of microwave-heating."
