0,Introduction,"Renewable energy sources are highly desirable in this era of diminishing fossil fuels reserves and increasing environmental concerns. Several alternatives of renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, ethanol and biodiesel, are currently been exploited in order to promote a more sustainable development. Hydrogen is an attractive alternative fuel because of its availability (the most abundant element in the universe), it can be utilized in different applications and produced from a variety of feedstocks. At present, almost 95% of the world's hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels [1]. Renewable biomass is a promising source for hydrogen production due to its environmental benefits since the produced CO2 is consumed during biomass growth providing a carbon neutral cycle. Current processes for conversion of biomass to hydrogen, such as gasification and steam reforming, involve high temperatures and many side reactions, which decrease hydrogen selectivity [2,3]. Glycerol reforming for hydrogen production has been recently reviewed by Vaidya and Rodrigues [4]. Aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of oxygenated compounds derived from biomass to produce hydrogen, first developed by Dumesic et al., has several advantages [5]. It can be carried out at low temperatures, reducing the cost of the process because it is not necessary to vaporize water and minimizing undesirable decomposition reactions. Furthermore, it is possible to generate H2 and CO2 in a single step with low levels of CO, which is important for fuel cell applications [6]. Many oxygenated compounds, such as methanol, sorbitol, glycerol, ethyleneglycol and ethanol, have been used in APR process [5,7–9]. Glycerol is produced as a by-product during biodiesel production by transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. One ton of biodiesel yields about 110kg of crude glycerol or about 100kg of pure glycerol [10]. As biodiesel production increases exponentially, the crude glycerol is also produced in a large amount. One of the promising ways to utilize this diluted crude glycerol is to produce hydrogen by APR. Supported Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Ni catalysts have been tested in APR process and have shown good activity and selectivity for hydrogen production. The mechanism of H2 production by APR was described by Dumesic group [5,7,11]. The process involves the cleavage of C–C bonds as well as C–H bonds to form adsorbed species (especially CO) on the catalyst surface (Eq. (1)); then CO is converted in H2 and CO2 by the water–gas shift reaction (Eq. (2)): (1) C3H8O3 ↔3CO+4H2 (2) CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2 Thus, a good catalyst for APR process has to be active in the cleavage of C–C bonds and water–gas shift reaction, but has to inhibit the cleavage of C–O bond and methanation reactions. Ni shows a good activity for C–C scission followed by water–gas shift reaction, but it also exhibits high rates of methanation [6]. Dumesic group [11,12] reported that addition of Sn to Ni catalysts increases the selectivity for hydrogen production by decreasing the selectivity toward the formation of alkanes. Iriondo et al. [13] showed that addition of Ce to Ni/Al2O3 improved initial glycerol conversion and hydrogen selectivity for APR of glycerol. Buffoni et al. [14] observed that Ce inhibits dehydration reactions during steam reforming of glycerol, avoiding formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons that are coke precursors. Ceria support is used in several formulations of Ni steam reforming catalysts because it increases catalytic stability by promoting carbon removal from the metallic surface [15]. Zhang et al. [16] and Adhikari et al. [17] studied steam reforming of glycerol over Ni/CeO2 catalysts and did not observe any significant deactivation due to coke formation. To our knowledge, Ni/CeO2 catalysts have not been investigated in APR of glycerol yet. In this context, the objective of this work is to study nickel catalysts supported on ceria, prepared by three different methodologies (wet impregnation, co-precipitation and combustion), in aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production. The effect of the preparation methodology on the catalytic activity for reforming reaction and hydrogen selectivity was investigated, correlating with structural and morphological properties."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ni/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by three methodologies: wet impregnation (NiCe-Imp), co-precipitation (NiCe-CP) and combustion (NiCe-Com). The nominal NiO content was 20wt.% for all samples. NiCe-Imp was prepared by wet impregnation of CeO2 support, obtained from calcination of cerium nitrate at 773K, with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O. The catalyst was subsequently dried overnight at 383K and calcined in flowing air at 773K for 3h. NiCe-CP was obtained by co-precipitation of aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O and Ce(NO3)3.6H2O using 0.2M Na2CO3 as precipitant, under vigorous stirring and pH control at 9.0. The resulted precipitate was stirred in contact with mother solution for additional 1h at 353K, followed by washing with hot water and filtration. The powder was dried at 383K overnight and calcined in flowing air at 773K for 3h. For preparation of NiCe-Com catalyst, a mixture of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O and Ce(NO3)3.6H2O was melted on a hot plate (423K), and urea was added to the molten nitrates. It was used the stoichiometric amount of urea as determined by the propellant chemistry [18]. The basin was then placed in a furnace, pre-heated at 873K, where the combustion reaction took place. The powder was then calcined in flowing air at 973K for 3h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the catalysts was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Rigaku (RIX 3100) spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in a Rigaku Miniflex X-ray diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator using CuKα radiation (40kV). The textural characteristics, such as BET specific area and pore volume (BJH method), were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at 77K in a Micromeritcs ASAP 2000. Prior to the analysis the samples were outgassed for 24h at 573K. The reducibility of the catalysts was analyzed by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), carried out in a microflow reactor operating at atmospheric pressure. The samples were firstly dehydrated at 423K under flowing Ar before the reduction. A mixture of 1.59% H2/Ar flowed at 30mL/min through the sample, raising the temperature at a heating rate of 10K/min up to 1273K. The outflowing gases were detected by thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The reactions of APR of glycerol were carried out in an autoclave batch reactor of 600mL with 450rpm of agitation, using 200mg of catalyst and 250mL of aqueous solution of 1 or 10wt.% glycerol. Before the reaction, the reactor was purged with He to remove air inside. The catalytic tests were performed at 523 and 543K, resulting in autogeneous pressures of 37 and 52atm, respectively. The catalysts were reduced ex situ under 75mL/min of 20%H2/N2 at 973K, using a heating rate of 10K/min. Gas products were collected every hour and analyzed online by gas chromatography (GC-1000), equipped with a Hayesep D column and TCD. The products detected in the gas phase were H2, CH4, CO2 and CO. The molar fractions of these products were calculated without considering water. In the liquid phase only glycerol was quantified by a colorimetric method, using an enzymatic kit for triglycerides and a spectrophotometer. Conversion was calculated based on the moles of glycerol in the feed."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the catalysts is presented in Table 1 . The nickel loading of all samples is similar to the nominal value (20wt.%) showing adequate preparation methodologies for incorporation of nickel. Table 1 summarizes the textural characteristics of the catalysts. From the average pore diameter, it can be observed that all samples are mesoporous solids. The BET area of NiCe-Imp catalyst is smaller than the area of CeO2 pure support (85m2/g). This reduction in area is possibly due to the partial blockage of the pores of support by NiO particles. The low BET area of the catalyst prepared by combustion method is associated with the sintering of the particles due to the high temperature reached during the combustion process [19]. XRD patterns of the catalysts after calcination and the pure CeO2 support are displayed in Fig. 1a. The diffractograms show two crystalline phases: cubic fluorite CeO2 (JCPDS 34-0394) and cubic NiO (JCPDS 47-1049). The peaks at 2θ values of 28.5°, 33.0°, 47.4° and 56.3° represent the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of CeO2, respectively. The NiO phase shows peaks at 2θ values of 37.2°, 43.3° and 62.9°, representing the (111), (200) and (220) planes, respectively. The diffraction peaks of NiO in NiCe-CP catalyst are very broad, indicating a good dispersion of NiO crystallites in CeO2 matrix, as suggested by Jun et al. [20]. For NiCe-Com catalyst there is a narrowing of the diffraction peaks, showing a higher crystallinity obtained by this methodology, which may be associated with the high temperatures achieved during the synthesis. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts after reduction at 973K. The diffractograms show that NiO was completely reduced to Ni0 (JCPDS 4-850), with diffraction peaks at 2θ=44.5°, and 51.8°, correspondent to (111) and (200) planes, respectively. Thus, the ex situ activation was successful in reducing the catalysts. Table 1 also shows the average crystallite size of NiO and Ni, obtained by the Scherrer equation, using the (200) plane of NiO and (111) plane of Ni. The combustion method produced NiO crystallites with larger size, possibly due to sintering of particles during the high temperature synthesis. The flame temperature during the combustion synthesis is highly influenced by the nature of the fuel, and it is possible to produce smaller NiO crystallites, better dispersed on CeO2, using citric acid as fuel, as proposed by Gonzalez-DelaCruz et al. [21]. However, the smallest Ni crystallites were obtained in the NiCe-Com catalyst after reduction, indicating a better nickel dispersion. This can be explained by the stronger interaction between nickel and ceria in the combustion method, decreasing the mobility of nickel particles during reduction. Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of the catalysts. NiCe-Imp catalyst presented a reduction peak at low temperature (570K), which can be attributed to the reduction of free NiO species segregated on the surface of the support [17]. The reduction peaks at temperatures ranging from 690 to 800K are attributed to reduction of NiO species strongly interacting with the support and partial reduction of the support forming nonstoichiometric cerium oxides (CeOx). The presence of the low temperature reduction peak and the lower temperature of the main reduction peak for the NiCe-Imp catalyst shows that the interaction between NiO and CeO2 is weaker in this catalyst, as also observed by Chary et al. [22]. All profiles also showed an additional reduction peak at 1200K, which represents the reduction of bulk CeO2. According to Shyu et al. [23], the reduction of ceria capping oxygen occurs at around 593–753K, and the reduction of bulk CeO2 from Ce4+ to Ce3+ at temperatures higher than 1073K. Table 2 shows the experimental consumption of H2, calculated by integration of TPR profiles at temperatures up to 970K, and the theoretical uptake, considering the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0, as well as the reduction degrees. All catalysts presented reduction degree higher than 100%, which is associated with a partial reduction of the support, forming suboxides species."
7,Catalytic tests,"3.2 Catalytic tests The catalytic activity of the nickel catalysts for aqueous-phase reforming of 1wt.% glycerol solution at 523 and 543K is displayed in Fig. 3 . At 523K, the conversions increased with time up to about 6h, while at 543K they increased continuously up to 12h, except for NiCe-Com. It can be seen that the glycerol conversion increases by increasing the reaction temperature for all catalysts but this increase is much more pronounced for NiCe-Com. At 523K, the NiCe-Imp catalyst presented the highest conversions, of about 21% after 6h, while the conversion for NiCe-Com was lower than 13%. At 543K, the conversion of NiCe-Com was initially very low (7%) but achieved 30% after 12h, against 24% for NiCe-Imp. In order to understand the great increase in the glycerol conversion with temperature on NiCe-Com catalyst, XRD analysis of the catalyst after reactions were performed, with the results displayed in Fig. 4 . XRD pattern of the catalyst after reaction at 523K shows that nickel is reoxidized and some carbon is formed. On the other hand, after reaction at 543K the metallic nickel is preserved. Thus, the low activity of NiCe-Com catalyst for the reaction at 523K is related to the oxidation of nickel active sites and carbon deposition. The oxidation of Ni sites can be related to CO2 dissociation near the Ni–CeO2 interface, providing oxygen species that migrates to the metal particle [24]. The product distribution of the APR of 1wt.% glycerol at 523K is shown in Fig. 5 . H2, CO2, CH4, and CO were the only reaction products identified in the gas phase. The reactions using NiCe-Imp and NiCe-CP catalysts showed initial molar fraction of H2 higher than 90%, but during the reaction decreased to approximately 77%. For NiCe-Com catalyst the molar fraction of H2 remained stable around 85%. The CO2 produced in reactions with the NiCe-Imp and NiCe-CP catalysts showed low initial molar fraction, around 1%, but stabilized near 20 or 15%, respectively, while the reaction performed using the NiCe-Com catalyst produced around 10% of CO2. Molar fraction of CO stayed below 7% and production of CH4 was very low, with molar fraction less than 1% for all catalysts. The higher selectivity of NiCe-Com catalyst for production of hydrogen may be related to the lower Ni crystallite size. The lower Ni particle size of combustion derived catalyst decreases the number of surface ensembles composed of multiple nickel atoms that are necessary for CO dissociation, thus resulting in higher H2 selectivity. This effect is similar to the addition of Sn to nickel catalysts as reported by Dumesic group [11,12]. The maximum H2 molar fraction obtained by Shabaker et al. [11] in APR of glycerol using Ni–Sn catalyst was 64%, at 538K, with 30% of CO2. Wawrzetz et al. [25] showed that with increasing Pt particle size, H2 and CO2 formation decreased in APR of glycerol, while the rates to oxygenated C2 and C3 products from hydrodeoxygenation increased. For NiCe-Imp and NiCe-CP catalysts the distribution of products at 523K followed the same trend: H2 production decreased with time, while CO2 increased, which can be related to the fact that oxygenated hydrocarbons can readily undergo hydrogenolysis reactions on Ni surface [26]. Alternatively, hydrogen produced can be used in the hydrogenation of products from dehydration, as hydroxyacetone and 3-hydroxypropanal, as suggested recently by Wawrzetz et al. [25]. Fig. 6 presents the product distribution for APR of 1wt.% glycerol at 543K. Reactions performed with NiCe-Imp and NiCe-Com catalysts presented molar fraction of H2 initially around 85% and decreased to approximately 70% in the end of 6h of reaction. NiCe-CP catalyst showed more stability in molar fraction of H2, around 75%. Formation of CO2 stabilized at 15 and 30% using NiCe-CP and NiCe-Com catalysts, respectively; however, CO2 molar fraction continued to increase even after 6h of reaction with NiCe-Imp, reaching 22%. The molar fraction of CO was high at the beginning of the reaction, especially with NiCe-CP, which reached 16% and stabilized at 10%, however for the reactions with NiCe-Imp and NiCe-Com catalysts the molar fraction of CO stabilized at 5 and 2%, respectively. The production of CH4 remained below 1% for all catalysts. From Figs. 5 and 6, it appears that lower operating temperatures result in higher H2 production, which may be due in part to lower conversions of glycerol (Fig. 3), as observed by Shabaker et al. [11] using Ni–Sn catalysts. The aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol produces primarily H2 and CO2, according to reaction (3). In the present study, the H2 production varied between 70–90%, while CO2 was in the range of 10–30%, showing that H2/CO2 ratio was much higher than the stoichiometry of the reforming reaction, which indicates that the reaction did not occur according to purely APR. It is possible for glycerol to undergo dehydration and/or hydrogenation/dehydrogenation to produce H2 and liquid products, such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetic acid, propylene glycol and diglycerol, all of which were detected in the liquid products by Luo et al. [27]. According to Dumesic group [11,12], the liquid effluent of APR of oxygenated hydrocarbons contains only trace amounts of byproducts, such as aldehydes, alcohols, and organic acids (less than 50ppm at conversions greater than 90%). (3) C3H8O3 +3H2O↔3CO2 +7H2 Moreover, it can be seen from Figs. 5 and 6 that the formation of CO is low, indicating that the low temperature favors the water–gas shift reaction, since Ni has a moderate activity in this reaction (Eq. (2)). Although it is well known that supported Ni catalysts have high activity in methanation reactions of CO and CO2 [5], the CH4 formation was very low in the present study. The catalyst that presented the highest conversion in the reaction at 523K (NiCe-Imp) was also tested with solution of 10% glycerol, keeping the other variables equal. The increase of the concentration of glycerol from 1 to 10% caused a reduction in the conversion from 21 to 8%. The gas phase composition is shown in Fig. 7 . The molar fraction of H2 presented a decrease in relation to the reaction with 1% glycerol, beginning at 82% and decreasing to 67% after 10h. Wen et al. [28] obtained 59% of H2 and 18% of alkanes in the gas phase for APR of 10wt.% glycerol at 503K, using Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The main difference in the gas phase is related to the formation of carbon monoxide, which was greater than that of carbon dioxide using 10% glycerol. The molar fraction of CO reached 20% after 10h of reaction. Thus the increase in concentration of glycerol decreased the occurrence of the water–gas shift reaction."
8,Conclusions,"Nickel catalysts supported on ceria were synthesized by three different methods: impregnation, co-precipitation and combustion. The catalyst prepared by combustion has lower specific surface area but Ni crystallites formed upon reduction are smaller, indicating a good metal dispersion. The Ni/CeO2 catalysts showed great potential to be used in aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol, with good activity and high hydrogen production. Using solution of 1wt% glycerol, a maximum glycerol conversion of 30% was attained at 543K, with H2 molar fraction higher than 70%. These CeO2-supported catalysts showed lower formation of methane than alumina supported nickel, as reported in the literature. The catalyst prepared by combustion presented higher glycerol conversion at 543K and higher production of hydrogen at 523K, with solution of 1% glycerol, which may be related to the lower Ni crystallite size. This catalyst showed low glycerol conversion at 523K due to oxidation of Ni active sites and carbon deposition. The increase in glycerol concentration from 1 to 10wt% caused a decrease in glycerol conversion and hydrogen production."
