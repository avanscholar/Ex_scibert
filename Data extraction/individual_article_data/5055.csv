0,Introduction,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) being a conveniently storable and transportable chemical fuel has a massive demand in automobile sector [1,2]. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation via water splitting is a simple oxidation-reduction reaction, usually performed at ambient conditions, which can greatly contribute for the sustainable and clean fuel production [3,4]. In these directions, identification and development of new material systems and their synthesis strategies are some of the promising approaches. Alternatively, the quest for super-efficient catalysts, which are stable under various experimental conditions and facilitate the continuous hydrogen generation in water or water containing sacrificial agents, is in great progress [5,6]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used as photocatalyst for hydrogen generation under UV light due to its Physico-chemical properties viz., suitable band edge potential, high stability, good surface area, low cost, enhanced photo corrosion resistance [4–9]. On the other hand, TiO2 encounters two major limitations, (i) a wide band gap that restricts its optical absorption in visible region and (ii) poor conduction of photo-generated charge carriers that greatly affects the rate of reaction. Hence, the modification with metal [10–12], metal oxides [13–15] and non-metals [16] showed beneficial properties viz., extended absorption in visible spectrum or acts as co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic efficiency. Recently, several nanocomposites were reported to improve the visible light absorption as well as charge carrier utilization for the enhanced rate of hydrogen production in TiO2 [17–19]. Similarly, a control over the morphology of the catalyst can provide better stability and activity by facilitating a rapid charge carrier transfer to the surface [20–22]. In this connection, one dimensional (1-D) morphology of photocatalysts such as nanotubes, nanorods and nanowires have been investigated to improve the H2 production efficiency. They have unique properties like (a) unidirectional flow of electron-hole along the 1-D axis due to quantum confinement effect, (b) a large number of active sites available on catalyst surface, (c) enlarged band edge potential, (d) better separation of excitons (electron and hole), (e) Minimum number of grain boundaries at one dimensional nanostructure, which facilitated enhanced rate of catalytic H2 production [23–27]. Recently Praveen kumar et al., explored effect of TiO2 morphology (nanotubes and nanorods) on photocatalytic hydrogen production and emphasised the high photocatalytic efficiency of nanotubes attributed to more number of active sites on the interior as well as exterior of tubular surface [28]. Liu et al., examined nanowires based hetero junctions with various types of semiconductors like the metal oxide and metal sulphide nanocomposites for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production [29]. However, these reports have limited success on the stability and continuous hydrogen generation for extended time or recycling experiments. In materials perspective, nano-sized particles and nanostructures of CdS displayed improved hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. However, dissolution of CdS into Cd2+ and S2− in water under light irradiation dramatically affects its catalytic efficiency [30–32]. Reports on core/shell structured catalysts (CdS/ZnO, CdS/CdSe, CdS/NiO, CdS/TiO2) ascertain that the shell materials facilitate the facile separation of charge carriers and protection of core material in aqueous solution [33–35]. Several chemical methods have been adopted for the preparation of CdS/TiO2 based core/shell materials. Park et al. [36] explored photocurrent and photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance of CdS/Pt-TiO2 hybrid system synthesized by sol–gel method. Arabzadeh et al. [34] reported the synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activity of CdS/TiO2 nanowires for organic synthesis for oxidation reactions. Das et al. [37] adopted simple method for the preparation of CdS/TiO2 nanostructures and examined its physico-chemical properties. Ghows et al. [38] explored an ultra sound-cum-microemulsion method for the synthesis of CdS/TiO2 materials. Wang et al. [40] examined spatial separation of excitons at core/shell morphology of co-catalysts for efficient reduction and oxidation of water. Preethi et al. [41] claimed efficient hydrogen production in aqueous solution containing Na2S/Na2SO4 sacrificial agent using Fe2O3/CdS nanoparticles. Thus one dimensional core/shell nanostructures have been successfully used for enhanced H2 generation and minimize the stability issues. Recent reports claimed an improved and stable hydrogen production using core/shell 1-D nanostructures viz., CdS/Ni(OH)2 [42], CNFs@ZnIn2S4 [43], In2O3–In2S3 [44], ZnO/ZnxCd1−xTe [45], ZnO@ZnS–Bi2S3[46], ZnO/ZnS–PdS [47], TaB2/Ta2O5 [48], ZnO/CdS [49], CdS/NiO [50]. Also the Table 1 depicted the reports of one dimensional core/shell nanostructure for photocatalytic H2 activity. Zhang and co-authors utilized core/shell (metal/metal oxide) nanocompo sites for oxidation reactions such as primary alcohols to aldehyde and reported enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation performance [51]. However, to the best of our knowledge the influence of shell thickness and facile synthesis procedure for CdS/TiO2 nanorods with core/shell morphology for photocatalytic hydrogen production are not reported. In addition, it is envisaged that the use of hydrothermal method is beneficial to prepare large quantity of samples with improved catalytic activity. In core/shell materials, besides the synthesis methods, the shell thickness also plays crucial role for the enhancement of the hydrogen production. Since the shell acts as a protective material, it can retain the surface trap states of the core. Thus the control over shell is important objective for the minimization of charge carriers recombination and protection of core material from photo-corrosion and other stability issues. In this context, a controlled synthesis of CdS/TiO2 core/shell nanorod photocatalysts and fine-tuning of shell thickness in nanoscale are explored. Accordingly, the TiO2 shell thickness about 6 nm is synthesized for optimum hydrogen generation. The catalytic activity experiments were carried out under UV–vis or visible light irradiation. The optimized core/shell catalyst displayed around 1.6 folds higher activity than pristine core (CdS) and shell (TiO2). The reaction variables such as initial concentration of sacrificial reagents Na2S + Na2SO4 in water and solution pH were optimized to achieve higher photocatalytic activity. The prolonged hours of photocatalytic experiments were carried out to evaluate the stability of the photocatalyst. The superior performance of the catalyst reported in this study is also compared with literature reports and presented in Table 1."

3,Hydrothermal synthesis of CdS and CdS/TiO2 core/shell materials,"2.2 Hydrothermal synthesis of CdS and CdS/TiO2 core/shell materials A simplified cartoon representation of hydrothermal synthesis procedure is depicted in Fig. 1 . In a typical synthesis, cadmium chloride (0.13 M) was dissolved in water (40 mL) under magnetic stirring (10 min), results in Cd(OH)2 formation. To the above solution, an aqueous thiourea (0.73 M) was added drop-wise and stirred well for 1 h. It is proposed that thiourea react with Cd(OH)2 to form Cd(NH2CSNH2)(OH). Then the resulting colourless clear solution was subjected to the hydrothermal treatment in Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (capacity 50 mL) at 180 ± 2 °C for 24 h. Thus the obtained precipitate was washed twice with water followed by ethanol via centrifuge at 10,000 rpm. (REMI, C-24BL). Finally, the bright orange colour precipitate was kept in an electric oven pre-heated at 80 ± 1°C and dried it for 12 h, and labelled as CdS NR. A thin-layer of TiO2 wrapped-up as shell on the CdS NR was synthesised as below. CdS NR (0.61 g, 0.15 M) was dispersed into 2-propanol (50 mL) under sonication for 30 min. Subsequent addition of titanium tetra isopropaoxide (TTIP) solution (1.4 mL, 0.15 M) and H2O (30 mL) was added and stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture was subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 180 ± 2 °C for 15 h, during this process a thin-layer of TiO2 wrapped as shell on CdS NR was formed. Then, the obtained precipitate was separated by ultra-centrifucation subsequently washed with water and ethanol followed by drying at 80 ± 1 °C for 12 h. The pale orange colour precipitate was labelled as core/shell CdS/TiO2 NR. In order to optimize TiO2 shell thickness, the amount of TTIP 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 M was varied in 2-propanol and the resulting catalysts are labled as C3T1, C3T2, C3T3, C3T4 and C3T5, respectively."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization All the prepared catalysts were subjected to various characterization techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded 2θ = 20–60° using a BRUKERD8 ADVANCE X-ray diffract meter using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX), elemental mapping was obtained by using high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM; FEI Tecnai F20 S-Twin) operating at 200 kV. DR UV–vis spectrum was recorded by Varian Cary 5000 UV–vis-NIR Spectrophotometer. The oxidation state and surface composition of the catalyst was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 Xi-XPS system) with Al Kα radiation. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using spectro-fluorometer (FP8500, JASCO) at the excitation wavelength of 230 nm."
5,Photocatalytic experiment for hydrogen production,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiment for hydrogen production The quartz-made Kjeldhal flask reactor (185 mL) having single-port tightly sealed with a highly quality rubber septum for out-gassing and sampling. Typically, 5 mg of catalyst was dispersed into 50 mL of 0.3 M of Na2S and Na2SO4 aqueous solution and stirred for 30 min. in dark. The gases present in the free space of the quartz reactor and dissolved in the solution were removed by evacuating the reactor under vacuum followed by high purity nitrogen (N2) purging. Photocatalytic activity experiments under UV–vis light was carried out using 250 W Mercury lamp (Philips, model HPL-N). The average intensity of the light source (150,000 ± 100 lx) was measured using digital Lux meter (Model No: TES 1332 A). The visible light experiments using Xenon lamp (ORIAL instruments, New Port Co., Ltd, USA) with UV cut-off filter λ > 420 nm (FSQ-ND01). The fixed distance between the light source and reactor was maintained (4.5 cm) to minimize the thermal effect and reproducible results. In order to check the long-term stability of catalyst for prolonged usage, time-on-stream experiments were carried out continuously for 20 h, and rate of Hydrogen generation was measured for every 5 h interval. The control and blank (without catalyst) experiments were carried out under identical conditions."
6,Gas analysis and quantification of hydrogen production,2.5 Gas analysis and quantification of hydrogen production The off-line gas analysis system was adopted for gas generated during photocatalytic experiment. Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and molecular sieve/5 Å column under constant flow of nitrogen gas (IOLAR grade). The analysis conditions are given in Table 2 . The high pure hydrogen gas (IOLAR grade) with variable concentration was injected to standardize the equipment. The gas sample was injected at periodic intervals and the obtained peak area was used to calculate the volume of hydrogen generation. The standard hydrogen or oxygen gas was periodically injected into the gas chromatograph to ensure the stability of column and performance of the gas chromatograph equipment.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Crystal structure and morphology,"3.1 Crystal structure and morphology Fig. 2 shows X-ray diffraction pattern of pristine CdS, TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 core/shell (C3T1 to C3T5) catalysts. The peak indexed at 2θ = 25.4° indicates (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No: 21-1272). The pristine CdS exhibited well crystalline structure and the peaks indexed at 2θ = 24.7, 26.5, 28.2, 36.6, 43.8, 47.9, 51.9 and 53.2° corresponds to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112) and (201) planes of hexagonal greenockite CdS phase respectively (JCPDS No: 89-2944). Similarly, rest of the CdS/TiO2 (CxTy) catalysts also exhibited similar XRD pattern, where the peak intensities found to be increased from C3T1 to C3T2 which is directly proportional to crystallinity of TiO2 with concentration of TTIP precursor. On the other hand, the peak intensity was found to be decreased from C3T3 to C3T5, which is ascribed to the less crystalline or existence of crystalline-amorphous nature of the samples. In addition to this, the observed changes can also be ascribed to the random distribution of TiO2–shell onto the CdS from thinner to thicker layer due to lower to higher precursor concentration, respectively. Liu et al. [33] reported that the appearance of weak diffraction peaks for CdS due to the dense coating of TiO2 over CdS nanowires. In contrast to that Chen et al. [35] did not observe TiO2 peaks in their CdS/TiO2 catalyst, which was ascribed to the low diffraction intensity and overlapping of CdS and TiO2 peaks at 2θ = 25.4°. This clearly indicates that the synthesis methods can also affect the crystal structure of the materials. Fig. 3 displays the nanorod morphology of pristine CdS and CdS/TiO2 core/shell (C3T3) photocatalyst. The avergae diamter of the prestine CdS nanorods was measured to be about 84 nm (Fig. 3(a). Further, it can also be seen that the CdS core is uniformly covered by the thin-layer of TiO2 shell as shown in Fig. 3(b). The avergae length and diameter of the NR is found to be around 300 and 82 nm, respectively and the average thickness of TiO2 shell is found to be around 6.3 nm. It is reported that the thin shell thickness faciliates the transmission of the indcident light to the core material and improves the migration of excitons to the surface for the red-ox reactions to take place in the photocatalyst [52,53]. The HR-TEM image of C3T3 catalyst showed a lattie fringes of 0.321 and 0.351 nm corresponding to the existance of (101) plane of CdS and (101) plane of anatae TiO2, respectively (Fig. 3c). The chemical composition of the catalyst that analysed using TEM-EDX (Fig. 3d) revealed the presence of Ti, Cd, S, and O elements. The TEM-elemental mapping image (Fig. 3e) displays TiO2 covered on CdS. Han et al. [39] have measured the shell nm-size thickness of TiO2 shell in CdS/TiO2 using TEM images."
9,Optical and surface chemical properties of photocatalysts,"3.2 Optical and surface chemical properties of photocatalysts DR UV–vis spectra of photocatalysts are given in Fig. 4 . The pristine CdS NR shows visible light absorption around 580 nm, whereas the pristine TiO2 absorbs predominantly in UV spectrum about 390 nm. Further, with thin-layer coating of TiO2 shell on CdS core shows red shift and the absorption peak appears at lower wavelength range, than CdS core [33,39]. The relative intensity of the core/shell, with respect to core, decreases but absorption edge is shifted from 600 to 575 nm with increasing concentration of TiO2 from C3T1 to C3T5. Hence, the presence of TiO2 can decrease the visible light absorption of CdS to some extent [35]. The absorption shoulder around 600 nm in CdS/TiO2 catalysts can be attributed to the visible light absorption characteristics of CdS [54]. Fig. 5 (a)–(e) shows the X-ray photo electron spectroscopy measurements of optimized catalyst (C3T3). The survey spectrum of C3T3 showed peaks corresponding to Cd, S, Ti, O elements (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5(b) displays Cd 3d narrow scan which reveals two peaks located at 404.1 and 410.8 eV corresponds to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively. The observed binding energy (BE) values of Cd confirmed that Cd is in Cd2+ state. Fig. 5(c) shows S 2p spectrum, where the pair of peaks observed for S2− at 161.6 and 162.8 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively. All the observed BE values of Cd and S are well matched with literature reports [49,55,60]. Fig. 5(d) shows two peaks at 457.6 and 463.4 eV corresponding to 2 p3/2 and 2 p1/2 of Ti4+ state, respectively. The peak observed at 528.4 eV corresponding to O 1s state suggesting the existence of oxygen ions with -2 valence state (Fig. 5e). The literature reports also shows that the binding energy values of Ti, O, Cd, S in core/shell materials tend to show minor shifts when compare it with the non-core/shell materials [63]. Moreover, Yu et al. [32] explained that the non-core/shell nano-composite tend to show Ti 2p peaks at around 459.0 and 464.4 eV, which showed minor shift compared with the core material."
10,Photocatalytic activity under UV–vis light irradiation,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity under UV–vis light irradiation The overall photocatalytic activity of core/shell CdS/TiO2 (C3T3) was initially performed in purified water suspension. After a continuous light irradiation of 4 h, the produced gas sample was injected into the chromatograph and no characteristic peaks for either hydrogen or oxygen were found and experiments were repeated with fresh system for two more times and did not observe any activity. Based on these results, it was confirmed that C3T3 is inactive for overall water splitting. Then, the same catalyst was dispersed in aqueous solution containing inorganic sacrificial agents (Na2S + Na2SO4) with varying concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 M (at solution pH from 12.06 to 12.44). Accordingly, Fig. 6 (a) displays the increased volume of hydrogen generation with irradiation time, which is also observed for all the five samples. When the concentration of sacrificial agent was increased from 0.1 to 0.3 M, an increased activity was observed, whereas at higher concentrations (0.4 and 0.5 M) a decreased activity is observed. The catalyst tested with 0.3 M of sacrificial agent showed the highest hydrogen production of 20,050 mL g−1 of catalyst for 4 h. The physisorbed S2- and SO4 2- ions on the catalyst surface get involved in oxidation-reduction reactions with in-situ generated excition, which in-turn led to the production of the hydrogen gas. It is possible that at the higher concentrations, the density of ions adsorbed at catalytic active sites is significantly affected by Van der Waals force of attraction and resulting to the suppression of catalytic activity of the photocatalyst. Preethi et al. [41] explained that the optimization of initial concentration of Na2S and Na2SO4 is an essential parameter to achieve higher hydrogen production and similar discussions can also be found in the other literature as well [57,58,62]. Fig. 6(b) displays photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance of CdS/TiO2 core/shell material from 0.3 M of Na2S + Na2SO4 aqueous solution. These experiments were conducted to understand the effect of shell thickness (C3T1 to C3T5) which is directly proportional to concentration of TiO2 precursor (varied from 0.05 to 0.25 M). The hydrogen production data presented here is an average value of three consecutive experiments conducted under similar conditions. Among the catalysts tested, C3T3 displayed a higher rate of hydrogen generation of 4,992 mL g−1of catalyst, which is ∼28 and 39% higher than C3T1 and C3T2 catalysts, respectively. The observed increment in the catalytic activity of C3T1 and C3T2 can be ascribed to the partial coverage of core and improved optical activity of TiO2 shell. On the other hand, the observed decreased hydrogen generation on C3T4 and C3T5 can be ascribed to the increased shell thickness that screened the overall optical activity of the system. Generally, in the core/shell structured photocatalyst, the shell thickness between 2–20 nm often transmits the light effectively to the photo-active core and facilitates the migration of in-situ generated excitons to the shell surface and led them to involve in the reduction-oxidation reactions. Among the catalysts, C3T3 displayed ∼ 39 and 28% higher rate of hydrogen production ascribed to almost complete coverage of thin layer of TiO2 over CdS nanorods (vide supra), whereas the decreased activity could be due to the random coverage of CdS by TiO2 [52,53]. Sakamoto et al. [68] reported that the shell thickness in 2–6 nm range could be beneficial for large volume of hydrogen production. Zhang et al. [69] synthesized M@TiO2 (M = Au, Pd, Pt) core-shell nanostructures with tuneable shell thickness that facilitated the improved photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this direction, the present study also confirms that optimization of shell thickness is important to improve the photocatalytic activity of the core/shell structured photocatalysts. The effect of initial solution pH on the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen generation is shown in Fig. 6(c). The solution pH such as 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are adjusted using 0.1 and 0.01 M H2SO4 solution [59–61]. The steady increase in hydrogen generation is observed for pH 6,7 and 8 due to the well dissociated sacrificial ions (from HS− to S2− ions) on the catalyst surface. Whereas it is decreased when the pH is 9 and 10 [41], the highest rate of hydrogen production was observed at pH 8, this may be attributed to that at pH 8, the pH > the point of zero charge (pzc) value of CdS (5.6) and TiO2 (6.7). Point of zero charge is characteristic feature of catalyst which greatly influences the adsorption-desorption properties. At below this unique pH value, the catalyst surface becomes positive and above pzc the surface becomes negative. As a result, the surface of the catalysts acquire negative charge and hence it absorbs positive ions such as H+, which performs the reduction reactions at surface of the catalyst and facilitates to produce hydrogen gas. Further, it also noticed that when the solution pH is greater than 8, the catalytic activity decreases, which may be due to the repulsion between the negative surface charges with anions and excessive hydroxyl ions [70–72]. From the above results, it is confirmed that the alkali medium with pH 8 is more favourable for the effective adsorption-desorption properties and thereby the enhanced production of hydrogen gas in the reaction. Bao et al. [73], reported a decrease in hydrogen generation at higher pH, which was due to hydrolysis of SO3 2− and S2− ions. Fig. 6(d) displays the comparison of C3T3 with pristine CdS and TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It is observed that core/shell photocatalyst showed un-precedent hydrogen generation activity of 5,791 mL h−1 g−1 of catalyst. Hence, the core/shell structure obviously minimizes the charge carriers’ recombination through uniform ultra thin-layer of contact between the core and the shell materials. The optimized core/shell CdS/TiO2, pristine CdS and TiO2 catalysts are evaluated by time-on-stream experiments for 20 h and its efficiency for hydrogen generation is displayed in Fig. 6(e). The generated gas was analyzed and quantified using Gas Chromatograph at periodic interval of 5 h and it is noticed that hydrogen production increases with time in the order of C3T3 > TiO2 > CdS NR. Fig. 6(f) shows the amount of hydrogen produced over all the three catalysts, where a linear increase in rate is observed up to 10 h and found decreases with time till 20 h. It could be due to the pristine CdS as well as TiO2, which undergoes fast recombination of charge carriers besides the instability for long hours and photo-corrosive properties of CdS. The decreased activity after 10 h may be due to the decreasing concentration of sacrificial agent with respect to time and formation of intermediates."
11,Photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation The effect of TiO2 shell thickness on the photocatalytic activity of CdS/TiO2 core/shell is evaluated for hydrogen production under visible light and results are displayed in Fig. 7 . From the obtained results, C3T2 showed highest rate of hydrogen generation of 454 mL h−1 g−1 of catalyst. It is observed that catalytic activity of C3T5 is about 50% lower than the optimized C3T2 under identical experimental conditions. The decrease in the activity with increase in amount of TiO2 shell is attributed to poor light transmission to the core, thus less number of excitons available for red-ox reactions. At optimized conditions, about 11 folds decreased activity compared to UV–vis light irradiation was observed. This could be due to the more photons and higher light intensity as compared to visible light. These above results confirm that only the CdS is activated under visible light and generated the excitons that responsible for the reduction reactions at TiO2 shell surface as TiO2 could not be excited under visible light. Further, experimental data recorded exclusively under visible light irradiation is utilized to calculate the efficiency using the standard formula [28]. V i s i b l e l i g h t t o h y d r o g e n p r o d u c t i o n e f f i e c i e n c y % = V o l u m e o f h y d r o g e n ( m m o l ) I n c i d e n t V i s i b l e l i g h t ( m W / c m ² ) × 100 The catalysts C3T1, C3T2, C3T3, C3T4 and C3T5 showed visible light to hydrogen production efficiency of 4.97, 6.77, 4.88, 4.27 and 3.18% respectively. Here the optimized core/shell photocatalyst C3T2 displayed enhanced H2 production efficiency. It is ascribed to effective generation and utilization of photo excitons for catalytic reactions and minimized the charge carrier recombination and results are depicted in Table 3 ."
12,Opto-electrical properties of photocatalyst,"3.5 Opto-electrical properties of photocatalyst Photoluminescence (PL) spectra demonstrate the Opto-electrical characteristics of semiconducting material, specifically the recombination possibilities of the excitons generated under light irradiation. Fig. 8 displays PL spectra of core/shell CdS/TiO2 (CxTy), pristine CdS and TiO2 photocatalysts. The PL emission peak that obtained between 595 nm and 615 nm wavelength can be attributed to the band-edge free excitations in anatase TiO2. Moreover, the PL peak intensities of the prepared catalysts are found to be in the order of C3T3 < C3T4 < C3T5 < C3T2 < C3T1 < CdS. It is obvious that the peak intensity of C3T3 is lowest of all the catalysts indicating that the minimized recombination possibility of the carriers in the catalyst. In the case of pristine CdS, the higher peak intensity is ascribed to the rapid recombination of the charge carriers. From the PL study, it is confirmed that the core/shell structure minimizes the charge carrier recombination and facilities better surface-interface reactions. Vaidya et al. [56] reported the decreased PL intensity of the CdS/TiO2 and ZnS/TiO2 core-shell structures."
13,Photocurrent density and photo-electrochemical analysis studies,"3.6 Photocurrent density and photo-electrochemical analysis studies The photocurrent responses of the core/shell and pristine catalysts were tested under UV–vis light irradiation and these results revealed the characteristics of the density of charge carrier generation in the system. The photocurrent measurements were recorded for several on–off cycles and the corresponding current density vs potential(V, vs RHE) curves was found to be in the order of C3T3 > C3T2 > TiO2 > CdS as shown in Fig. 9 (a). The photocurrent is generated mainly due to the charge separation and successive transportation of excitons to the back contact across the catalyst and it showed higher current density of 1.42 mA cm−2 for C3T3 core-shell photocatalyst. These results are in good agreement with photoluminescence spectra (vide infra) and attributed to the successive electron transfer from the conduction band of CdS core to the energy levels of TiO2 shell. The improved electron transfer property of C3T3 core/shell catalyst under UV–vis-light irradiation was demonstrated through photo-electrochemical (PEC) studies. The photocurrent density of the C3T3 catalyst was analyzed through linear sweep voltammeter (LSV) in the dark and under UV–vis-light irradiation (Fig. 9(b)). The chosen catalyst demonstrated a good stability in the electrolyte solution and a high photocurrent density. The photon absorption results in charge generation and the transfer of the charge carriers to the reaction sites through the interface results in a high photocurrent density. Thus, the LSV measurements indicated that the C3T3 core-shell nanostructures can show excellent stability and efficiency for photocatalytic reactions. Suneel Kumar et al. [74] reported the transient photocurrent responses of ZnO, MoS2–RGO, and RGO supported MoS2-ZnO to confirm the visible light activity via several on-off cycles. The current density is enhanced under visible-light irradiation for RGO supported MoS2/ZnO, which was attributed to the electron transfer from the CB of ZnO to the CB of MoS2 and to RGO owing to its lower Fermi level and finally they concluded that the cascade-transportation of electrons led to the effective suppression of electron–hole recombination and improved the activity. Recently Han et al. [39] was studied the photo-electrochemical performance of synthesized CdS/TiO2 type-II core/shell particles. Saho et al. [75] also reported that the photocurrent of the CdS/TiO2 nanotube array electrode is much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 nanotubes electrode. Moreover, the CdS/TiO2 nanotube array electrode is prompt in generating the photocurrents under intermittent illumination, indicating that the charge-transport properties are rapid in the system."
14,Plausible reaction mechanism of CdS/TiO2 for hydrogen generation,"3.7 Plausible reaction mechanism of CdS/TiO2 for hydrogen generation Based on the catalyst characterization and photocatalytic experimental results a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed and depicted in Fig. 10 . Upon light irradiation on the CdS/TiO2 catalyst, the light interacts with CdS-core through TiO2-shell and it excites the electrons to CB and the holes to VB (Eq. (1)). Due to difference in the band edge potentials between core and shell, the holes and electrons injected into the respective energy levels of shell material and facilitate them to reach the surface and involve in the oxidation-reduction reactions at the catalytic active sites. At valence band, oxidation reaction of sacrificial sulphate ions to per-oxy sulphate takes place in the presence of H2O (Eq. (2)) besides the H+ ions. On the other hand, the holes directly involve in the oxidation of sulphate ions into sulfide ions, where it leads to the formation of various oxidation intermediates such as dithionate, per-oxy disulfide ions as given in Eqs. (3)–(5). At conduction band, the H+ ions that adsorbed/formed at the catalytic active sites undergo the reduction reaction to produce hydrogen gas by utilizing electrons as mentioned in Eq. (6). Similar type of reaction mechanism can also be found in the literature. For example, Bubler et al. [62] studied the oxidation of SO3 2−, S2− ions at valence band through capture of holes by inorganic scavengers and then reduction of H+ takes place to generate hydrogen fuel at conduction band. Recently, in our group, we reported the observation of an enhanced hydrogen generation on CdS/NiO catalyst in the presence of sacrificial agent Na2S and Na2SO4, where it was claimed that the effective utilization of generated charge carriers by the inorganic scavengers facilitated the enhanced red-ox reactions and minimized photo-corrosion of the CdS material [50]. The reactions involved in the CdS/TiO2 core/shell photocatalytic process are described below. Reaction mechanism: (1) CdS/TiO2 + hv → e− + h+ At Valence Band: Oxidation reaction (2) SO4 2− + H2O + 2 h+ → SO5 2− + 2H+ (3) 2SO4 2− + 2 h+ → S2O8 2− (4) 2S2− + 2 h+ → S2 2− (5) S2 2− + SO4 2− → S2O4 2− + S2− At Conduction Band: Reduction reaction (6) 2H+ + 2e− → H2"
15,Conclusions,"In summary, a facile hydrothermal method was developed for the synthesis of CdS/TiO2 core/shell nanorods with tuneable shell thickness. The obtained X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the co-existence of highly crystalline CdS and anatase phase TiO2 in the synthesized CxTy photocatalysts. TEM analysis confirmed the nanorod morphology, whereas the HR-TEM and elemental mapping analysis confirmed the existence of CdS and TiO2 as core and shell material, respectively. The DR UV–vis spectrum of the synthesized catalysts showed blue-shift in the absorption edge with increasing TiO2 shell thickness. The photocatalytic activity carried out under UV–vis light irradiation confirmed that the optimized concentration of sacrificial agents (0.3 M), shell thickness of 6.3 nm and solution pH of 8.0 facilitated the enhanced rate of hydrogen production under UV–vis light. The time-on-stream experiments indicated the good stability of the prepared catalysts towards continuous hydrogen production for prolonged hours. Photoluminescence spectra and photo-electrochemical analysis evidenced the minimization of charge carrier recombination in the optimized CdS/TiO2 core/shell catalyst. The catalyst characterization data and photocatalytic activity experimental results revealed that the efficient light absorption and minimized charge carrier recombination under the optimized conditions are the key reasons for the observed enhanced hydrogen production in developed CdS/TiO2 core/shell nanorods."
