0,Introduction,"Spaceflight safety has recently become a topic of heated discussion. Safety in spaceflight includes various aspects. One of them is proper choice of fuel. Many researches are devoted to different types of rocket propellants analysis and their characteristics comparison [1–5]. Over hundreds of different liquid propellants were lab tested. The primary factors which are needed to choose a propellant include ease of operation, cost, hazards/environment and performance. One of the promising agents for the propellants is hydrogen peroxide. It is considered to be used as both an oxidizer and a monopropellant. Propellant based on hydrogen peroxide has a number of advantages such as high density, non-toxic, high specific impulse and others. In order to use the hydrogen peroxide as a propellant it must be of high quality and above 90% concentration to reduce the decomposition on the surfaces of contact [6–8]. High-concentrated hydrogen peroxide is very insensitive to detonation by shock or impact. Obtaining hydrogen peroxide of required quality is a particular problem. Nowadays three major industrial methods of hydrogen peroxide production exists (electrochemical, anthraquinone autoxidation, and isopropyl alcohol autoxidation). The first technology provides the highest quality product but with a very high power consumption. It is used only to obtain a highly concentrated product. It can be used in a special technique because of its high quality despite of its cost. Comparison of other two methods shows that product quality is practically the same, as well as its cost. However, in Russia method of isopropyl alcohol autoxidation has spread. This technology is more environment friendly but more explosive compared to anthraquinone autoxidation, which is spread in the rest of the world [9]. Ensuring safety in the hydrogen peroxide production based on the isopropyl alcohol autoxidation is a complex scientific and technical task."
