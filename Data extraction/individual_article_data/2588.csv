0,Introduction,"Carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas significantly contributes to the global warming, which makes its conversion into valuable chemicals one of the most important challenges facing the modern world. But the activation of CO2 is difficult because this molecule, in which carbon atom is completely oxidized, is very stable and inert. The catalytic hydrogenation is a possible way for reducing CO2 concentration in air by its conversion into valuable products [1]. This process can produce fuels and chemicals such as methanol [2,3], formic acid [4], higher alcohols [5], dimethyl ether [6], and hydrocarbons [7,8]. CO2 hydrogenation into hydrocarbons can be divided into two major branches: methanation (Sabatier reaction) [9] and higher hydrocarbon synthesis similar to CO hydrogenation via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [10]. The latter branch is interesting and promising from both the ecological and industrial points of view. It allows synthesizing light olefins or liquid hydrocarbons that are valuable raw materials for the production of polymers, synthetic fuels, oils, lubricants and for organic synthesis [11,12]. On the other hand, the excess of expensive hydrogen is usually required for this process, therefore, minimization of H2 consumption is the main challenge in the industrial CO2 conversion into fuels [13]. Unfortunately, in the majority of works devoted to CO2 hydrogenation the H2:CO2 ratio of 3 or even higher is used [8,12,14,15]. Cobalt and iron catalysts are widely used in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis but in the case of CO2 hydrogenation over cobalt systems the methanation (Sabatier reaction) dominates [1,16–18]. Precious metals are also active in these process [19], and only iron catalysts produce a noticeable amount of long hydrocarbons via the two-step mechanism: CO is generated in the reversible water gas shift (RWGS) process in the first step and hydrogenated into CxHy in the second step [20]. FeOx species are active in RWGS, while iron (mostly Hägg) carbide catalyzes the second step, and it was found that carbon supports promote higher carbidization degree of the catalyst than oxide ones [21,22]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are distinguished among other carbon materials by the unique set of mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties promising for industrial use [23]. The constant price reduction, inertness, and high thermal conductivity of CNTs stimulate the interest to their practical application as a catalyst support [24]. At the same time, low bulk density and powder nature are major drawbacks of CNTs for this application. Therefore, the development of a bulk dense CNT material is one of the main challenges in the catalytic industry. Hot pressing, pressing with binder and spark plasma sintering (SPS) are the most popular techniques for producing bulk CNT-based materials. The SPS approach combines the action of high pressure and pulsed current, which results in the fast heating of the sample (up to 1000 K/min). In addition to its high sintering speed the SPS technique preserves the porosity and structure integrity of CNTs [25,26], which is essential for catalytic applications. Moreover, it was proposed that covalent bonding between individual CNTs during SPS produces a dense CNT framework [27]. The SPS treatment of CNTs decorated with Co oxide nanoparticles led to the formation of a new and unique type of material in which carbon encapsulated Co0 nanocrystals were embedded into the framework of CNTs [28,29]. Such materials may be promising as hydrogenation catalysts because carbon shells stabilize metal particles, while the dense structure of CNTs prevents particle sintering [30]. Carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles is an outstanding member of the family of core-shell nanoparticles. Their magnetic properties can be utilized in the effective separation of nuclear wastes, in biochemical products, and in hyperthermia treatment [31]. They also showed promising properties in energy storage applications, electro- and photocatalysis [32,33]. Carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles may be used in electromagnetic absorbers both for military and commercial applications [34,35]. Finally, these materials typically show high catalytic activity in different processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, aerobic oxidation of lignin-derived alcohols, phenylacetylene and hydrogenation of other organic compounds [36–39], and their incorporation into a rigid matrix can further improve the stability of the catalyst [40]. Supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) is widely used as a solvent in different processes including the catalytic ones [41]. Supercritical conditions of CO2 in a catalytic reaction allow eliminating mass transfer limitations. Moreover, hydrogen possesses extremely high miscibility with sc-CO2, therefore, the remarkable efficiency could be achieved in hydrogenation processes [42–44]. The increased space-time yield provided by the high density of the reaction media is the main advantage of the CO2 reduction under supercritical conditions [45–47]. This work studies CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons over spark plasma sintered Fe/CNT catalysts. The supercritical conditions of CO2 were used to enhance the mass transfer and increase the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The effect of sintering temperature on the structure and performance of the catalysts was also studied along with the structure evolution of the catalysts during catalytic tests."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis and oxidation of CNTs,"2.1 Synthesis and oxidation of CNTs Multi-walled CNTs were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hexane over the Co-Mo/MgO catalyst at 750 °C. The CNT growth catalyst was prepared by the combustion technique from the water solution of cobalt and magnesium nitrates, ammonia molybdate, glycine, and citric acid (all components from Vecton, Russia). After dissolution of all the components under rigorous stirring and ultrasonic treatment the mixture was annealed in air at 230 °C for 5 h and then at 500 °C for 5 h. The synthesized CNTs were annealed in air at 400оC and refluxed in concentrated HCl (Chimmed, Russia) to remove the growth catalyst. Anchor sites for metal nanoparticles were created on the CNT surface by their treatment with HNO3 water solution (∼70%, Chimmed, Russia, density – 1.4 g/cm3, purity – 99.999%) for 6 h. After the treatment CNTs were washed with distilled water through a polypropylene vacuum filter until neutral pH and dried at 110 °C."
3,Impregnation of CNTs with iron oxide and their SPS,"2.2 Impregnation of CNTs with iron oxide and their SPS The iron-based catalyst (named as “FeCNT”) was produced by wetness impregnation of oxidized CNTs with Fe(NO3)2∙6H2O (Vecton, Russia, 99% purity) ethanol solution. The calculated metal loading was 10 wt%. After solvent evaporation at 70 °C the sample was dried at 110 °C overnight and then annealed at 350 °C in N2 flow for 2 h. A Labox-625 system (Sinterland, Japan) was used for SPS. The samples were sintered under applied pressure of 30 MPa at 800 and 1200 °C under vacuum of 1.3·10−6 MPa. For these purpose FeCNT powder was placed into a graphitic dye and heated under pressing by pulsed direct current up to a desired sintering temperature (Ts) at a heating rate of ∼100 K/min. Then it was isothermally sintered for 5 min and cooled down. Depending on the processing temperature the sintered catalysts were named as “Fe800SPS” and “Fe1200SPS”. Before catalytic tests the catalysts were grinded in mortar. Fig. 1 shows the scheme of the catalyst synthesis route."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The unreduced catalysts were tested in CO2 hydrogenation at 350 °C, 8.5 MPa, and H2:CO2 ratios of 1 and 2 at GHSV of 9600 and 14400 NmLgcat −1h−1, respectively. FeCNT catalysts was also tested immediately after pre-reduction in H2 (2400 NmLh−1) at 400 °C for 2 h (denoted as FeCNTr). A tested catalyst (0.5 g) was placed between two layers of quartz sand in a stainless-steel fixed bed U-type reactor with the i.d. of the catalyst zone of 8 mm. The CO2 pressure was initially raised by a piston pump and then hydrogen was added up to a desired H2:CO2 ratio using a gas flow controller. After that, the reactor was heated up to 350 °C at a rate of ∼7°/min. Analysis of the products started an hour after the reaction temperature was achieved. Catalysts were tested for 7–8 h at H2:CO2 ratio of 1 and then the same time at H2:CO2 ratio of 2. A Chromatec-Crystal and a LKhM gas chromatographs equipped with Thermo TR-5ms, СаА, and Porapak Q columns were used to analyze H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons. The analysis of the products was carried out on-line. To prevent product condensation in the chromatographic inlet valve, the lines were heated up to 120 °C. Hydrocarbons were identified by GC-MS using a Thermo Focus-DSQ II instrument. No alcohols were detected in the products except the traces of ethanol."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption using a Quantachrome AUTOSORB-1C/MS/TPR gas sorption analyzer. Prior to analysis the samples were degassed under vacuum for 3 h at 250°С. An Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd.) was used for XPS analysis. The pass energies of the analyzer were 160 eV for survey spectra and 40 eV for high-resolution scans. Raman spectra were registered on a LabRam HR800 UV microscope-spectrometer using 5 mW argon laser excitation. For each sample, the spectrum was recorded in five points. The 900–1900 cm−1 region of the spectra was curve fitted with Lorentz and Gaussian profiles using OriginLab software as described elsewhere [48,49]. XRD profiles were collected on a Stoe Stadi P instrument equipped with the Ni-filtered CuKα X-ray tube. The domain size of crystallites was calculated by the Scherrer equation. The microstructure of the catalysts was investigated by TEM using a JEM 2100 F/Cs microscope (JEOL). The iron content was measured by X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) on a “ReSPECT” spectrometer (Tolokonnikov Ltd., Russia) using an Ag-tube operated at 35 kV and 0.1 mA and Co3O4 as an internal standard. Mixture of Co3O4, Fe2O3 and oxidized CNTs were used as calibration standards."
6,Results and discussion,"Before analysis and catalytic tests, the sintered tablets were ground into powders. The specific surface areas (SBET) of FeCNT, Fe800SPS, and Fe1200SPS were 193, 225, and 147 m2/g. The growth of SBET after sintering at 800 °C resulted from the formation of defective graphitic shells around metal particles and partial breakage of CNTs under pressure [50]. The decrease in SBET after SPS at 1200 °C can be associated with healing of CNT defects and formation of thick graphitic shells, i.e. with graphitization of the material. The XRD analysis of the fresh FeCNT catalyst (Fig. 2 ) revealed the presence of the magnetite phase (PDF card #75-33) with the domain size of ∼6 nm as calculated using the Scherrer equation. Sintering led to the auto-reduction of Fe3O4 to bcc-Fe and fcc-austenite (Fe,C) (PDF cards #6-696 and #31-619, respectively) by CNTs [30]. Magnetite nanoparticles anchored on defects of the CNT surface can be easily reduced with carbon atoms near defects that are labile at the SPS temperatures. With increasing the sintering temperature from 800 to 1200 °C the formation of cementite Fe3C (PDF card #75-910) was observed, while magnetite reflexes completely disappeared in the XRD pattern. The TEM images of FeCNT (Fig. 3 a and b) show iron oxide nanoparticles of less than 10 nm in size located both inside CNT channels and on the outer CNT surface. Ultra-small dots of 0.5–1 nm in size are also observed in the images. They testify to the strong interaction between metal salt and oxygen groups on the surface of oxidized CNT support. SPS led to a significant particle sintering: both small (<5 nm) and large (up to 200–300 nm) metal particles are observed in Fe800SPS (Fig. 3c and d). Most of particles are covered with carbon shells, but the coverage is not always complete, which results in the partial oxidation of iron particles. FFT processing of the images revealed the presence of magnetite in this sample in addition to (Fe, C)-austenite and bcc-iron phases (Fig. 3e–g), which agrees with the XRD data. Amorphous Fe-contained particles are also observed in this sample (Fig. 3h). The TEM images of Fe1200SPS show mainly huge particles of 20–300 nm in size (Fig. 3i–k), with cementite (Fe3C) inclusions being detected in some of these particles (Fig. 3l). Practically no small crystallites were detected in this sample. More dense structure of Fe1200SPS confirms the growth of bulk density with increasing the sintering temperature [28]. The TEM data agree well with the phase composition of the samples determined by XRD. Thus, SPS at 800 °C, probably, incompletely reduces iron oxide particles to metal or carbide ones. Moreover, the short SPS time of 5 min is insufficient for complete coverage of all reduced particles with graphitic shells. As a result, a rather complex system is produced in which several types of iron-containing particles exist: • bcc-Fe or carbide particles covered with carbon shells of different defectiveness; • ultra-small amorphous iron carbide or iron oxide particles (determination of their phase composition is impossible both by TEM/SAED and XRD); • uncovered or partially covered metallic or carbide particles with the surface oxide layer formed during air exposure of the sample after SPS. • pure iron oxide particles formed during air exposure of the sample after SPS In opposite to Fe800SPS, iron in the Fe1200SPS sample seems to be completely reduced and iron-containing particles are covered with continuous graphitic shells."
7,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance All the catalysts were tested in CO2 hydrogenation at 350 °C and 8.5 MPa. At these conditions the reaction mixture can be considered as a supercritical fluid (the critical parameters of carbon dioxide are 31 °C and 7.4 MPa). The main advantages of carbon dioxide hydrogenation under supercritical conditions compared to the gas phase hydrogenation are up to 7–8 times higher hydrocarbon performance and the increased hydrocarbon selectivity [51,52]. The sintered catalysts showed noticeable CO2 conversion without pre-reduction in contrast to FeCNT, for which only CO2 activation to CO was observed along with slight methanation (Table 1 ). CO was mainly produced through the RWGS reaction that is known to be catalyze by magnetite [53]. FeCNT was also tested after pre-reduction (FeCNTr sample). In this case the CO2 conversion was close to those for the sintered catalysts, but the activity of Fe800SPS was still higher. Such effect can be attributed to the framework structure of the SPS catalysts in which activated and dispersed Fe-containing nanoparticles are distributed over the dense CNT support. At H2:CO2 ratio of 1 the selectivity to CO decreased with the growth of the sintering temperature (Fig. 4 a). This can be explained by the decrease in magnetite content. The opposite trend was observed at H2:CO2 of 2 (Fig. 4b), which may reflect the increased hydrogenation rate at higher hydrogen concentration. In other words, the reaction proceeds through CO2→CO→CxHy transformations, and in the case of higher H2:CO2 ratio more produced CO is spent for the hydrocarbon synthesis. Slightly higher selectivity to light hydrocarbons was observed for Fe1200SPS at H2:CO2 of 1 while at higher H2:CO2 ratio the selectivities were similar for both sintered samples. Compared to the sintered catalysts, FeCNTr demonstrated the similar CO2 conversion but higher selectivity to methane apparently because of the smaller particle size in this sample (Fig. 4b). Carbide crystallites less than 4 nm in size are known to be highly active in methanation [54]. As expected, the growth of H2:CO2 ratio increased the CO2 conversion but reduced both the C5+ and CO selectivities (Fig. 4c), which agrees with the earlier observed intensification of CO hydrogenation and chain growth termination under the increase in hydrogen content [12]. The calculated activities of the sintered catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation are among the highest activities of iron catalyst available in the literature, while the selectivities to the total hydrocarbon fraction and to C5+ products are rather high for unpromoted systems taking into account the low H2:CO2 ratio used in our work (Table S1). The activity of the reduced FeCNTr catalyst is also high. Carbon-based supports, especially CNTs, are the most promising supports for CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. Even uniformly dispersed iron nanoparticles do not form inactive complex oxides on the surface of such supports. High thermal conductivity of CNTs assists heat dissipation over the system, while the carbon – iron interaction promotes CO2 activation for the hydrocarbon production. SPS of Fe/CNT catalysts increases the interaction between iron particles and carbon support by densification of the material and activates the catalyst by the oxide reduction and carbide formation. CNT-supported systems showed better activities and selectivities to hydrocarbons than the sibunit-supported ones [51]. This fact can be explained by the enhanced electrical conductivity of CNTs and hence by easier activation of CO produced by the RWGS process. Carbon shells and the surrounding framework of CNTs intensify the carbidization of iron species, which also strongly increases the catalyst activity."
8,Study of used catalysts,"3.2 Study of used catalysts CO2 hydrogenation proceeds via two stages: the RWGS reaction is followed by the Fischer-Tropsch process. The second stage may significantly change the catalyst structure and composition because of the metal sintering, carbide generation, and carbon support transformations. For this reason, the used catalysts were studied by TEM, XPS, and XRD. The XRD pattern of the FeCNT catalyst tested without pre-reduction (Fig. 5 a) contains only magnetite reflexions and shows no signs of reduction or carbide formation during catalytic tests. This correlates with the low activity of this catalyst and negligible CO fraction in the reaction mixture. At the same time, the XRD patterns of the sintered samples significantly changed after catalytic tests. The formation of magnetite, Hägg carbide, and α-Fe was observed in used Fe800SPS. Usually, most part of iron and its oxides transforms into carbides during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, but in the case of CO2 hydrogenation the concentration of CO in the reaction mixture is too low to convert all iron species into carbides. XRD pattern of used Fe1200SPS shows more pronounced reflexes of Hägg carbide and less intensive peaks of magnetite. There are two possible reasons for magnetite formation in used catalysts of CO2 hydrogenation. Firstly, it can be produced by iron oxidation with CO2 and CO during synthesis. Secondly, air exposure after catalytic test may oxidize the surface of both carbide and metal nanoparticles. Weaker XRD reflexes of Fe3O4 in used Fe1200SPS than those in used Fe800SPS can be explained by the significantly higher percentage of larger particles in the former catalyst. The iron core of these particles remained unchanged during catalytic test. In contrast to the sintered catalysts, in which the crystallite size remained stable during catalytic test, magnetite crystallites in FeCNT significantly grew from 6 to 15 nm (Table 2 ). The used catalysts were also studied by in-situ magnetometry. The thermomagnetic curve (TMC) of used FeCNT (Fig. 5b) shows only the presence of magnetite with the Curie temperature (Tc) of ∼570 °C. In contrast, the significant contribution from iron carbide with Tc of ∼220–250 °C is observed in TMCs of both sintered samples, with the higher portion of carbide being detected in used Fe1200SPS, which agrees with the XRD data. The increase in magnetization after 500 °C for Fe1200SPS apparently corresponds to the formation of metallic iron via auto-reduction of the catalyst. The size of iron oxide particles in FeCNT increased after CO2 hydrogenation according to the TEM data (Fig. 6 a–c). Particles in the sintered catalysts also changed: ultra-small particle transformed into larger middle-sized crystallites of 10–50 nm in diameter (Fig. 6d–i). Core–shell particles with the carbide core and amorphous shell were also detected in these samples (Fig. 6e), which is typical for used Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts [55]. The disappearance of carbon shells during catalytic tests may explain the significant amount of magnetite in both used catalysts detected by XRD and magnetometry after air exposure of the samples. Probably, the reaction temperature (350 °C) was high enough to initiate the hydrogenation of labile carbon of the shells. Though the carbon shells produced by SPS were not stable under catalytic test, they allowed avoiding pre-reduction before CO2 hydrogenation. The surface composition and chemical state of iron in the fresh and used catalysts were analyzed by XPS. The high-resolution Fe2p spectra were fitted with three synthetic components attributed to Fe0, Fe2+, and Fe3+ species as described in Ref. [56] with the slight variation in peak positions in the range of 706.7–707.0, 708.3–708.5, and 710.7–711.0 eV, respectively. The decrease in the XPS concentration of iron in the sintered catalysts (Fig. 7 , Table 3 ) results from the high surface sensitivity of this techniques. Carbon shells attenuate the photoelectron signal from iron containing particles and reduce the apparent XPS concentration of iron, the same way as it was previously observed for the similar Co-based samples [28]. With increasing the sintering temperature, the concentration of iron on the surface decreased because of the formation of thicker graphitic shells and larger particles as detected by TEM. XPS confirmed the presence of metallic iron in the fresh sintered catalysts (Fig. 7). But the surface of these catalysts significantly changed after catalytic tests: the used samples showed a noticeably higher iron concentration on the surface and practically the absence of metallic iron (Fig. 7b). This testifies to the disappearance of carbon shells, which not only increases the concentration of iron on the surface but also facilitates oxidation of metallic iron in contact with air. Thus, the XPS data confirm the disappearance of the core-shell structure of metal particles and their oxidation detected by other techniques. At the same time, no noticeable changes were observed in FeCNT after catalytic test: because of the low catalytic activity of this catalyst only traces of metallic iron and the slight decrease in the Fe/C ratio due to the particle sintering were observed. Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate the effect of catalytic process on the defectiveness of carbon component in the sintered catalysts. The 900–1800 cm−1 region of Raman spectra (Fig. 8 a) was curve fitted with 5 components as shown in Fig. 8b. These components were attributed to the G band at ∼1580–1600 cm−1 corresponding to E2g stretching vibrations of the graphitic lattice; D1 band at 1355 cm−1 associated with the A1g mode of the lattice and appeared from grain boundaries in polycrystalline graphite and three defective band: D2 band at 1600–1620 cm−1 (small-size graphene clusters or side-wall defects), D3 band at ∼1500 cm−1 (amorphous carbon fragments and stacking defects), and D4 band at 1100–1250 cm−1 (amorphous carbon fragments) [48,57,58]. The 2D (G′) band also observed in the Raman spectra at ∼2700 cm−1 results from the second-order two-phonon process [59]. The following parameters were calculated and averaged for five measured points of each sample: FWHMs of D1 and G bands, area ratio of D to G band, and intensity ratio of G′ to G band. The increase in the SPS temperature expectedly decreased the defectiveness of carbon component: The D/G area ratios for Fe1200SPS are lower than or similar to those for Fe800SPS (Fig. 8c). The improvements in the structure and stacking order of graphene layers are also confirmed by the increase in the IG’/IG ratio. The graphitization of defects and formation of thick graphitic shells at 1200 °C mainly contribute to these improvements, which agrees with the previous study [28]. The carbon defectiveness slightly decreased during catalytic tests, probably, because of the methanation of carbon shells and defective sites. The FWHMs of D1 and G bands also slightly decreased after tests reflecting the structural ordering (Fig. 8d). There are two possible mechanisms of the catalytic activity of carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles. The first one implies that the catalytic reaction proceeds on the shell surface owing to the electron transfer from the metal core to graphene surface. This hypothesis, so-called “chainmail” catalysis [40], was supported by several theoretical calculations and it is especially applicable for electrocatalysis. The other explanation refers to the diffusion of reagents and products through defects in graphitic shells [60,61]. In our case the SPS-derived catalysts initially contain both thin defective and thick well-ordered shells, but the majority of them undergo partial destruction during CO2 hydrogenation according to the TEM, Raman, XRD, and XPS results because of the rather high reaction temperature combined with hydrogen presence and possible dissolution of carbon shells under metal carbide formation. Thus, the access of CO2 to the metal surface is provided by defects in the shells. The unique and flexible SPS technique used in this work for the synthesis of the iron-based CO2 hydrogenation catalysts have several advantages over existing approaches. For example, Jones et al. suggested an elegant and simple technique for the synthesis of iron catalyst at the stage of CNT growth by CVD of ferrocene [62–65]. This technique allows dispersing and stabilizing of iron oxide nanoparticles on CNTs without the impregnation stage. At the same time, it has several drawbacks: firstly, it implies two-step activation process (oxidation-reduction) since iron species in the as-prepared catalyst are inaccessible for reagents because of CNT walls; secondly, the synthesis of such catalysts requires using a ferrocene–toluene mixture or another organic iron-containing compound, while conventional multi-walled carbon nanotubes are usually synthesized from light hydrocarbons over a catalyst. The SPS technique is more flexible in terms of the catalyst support. Though the impregnation stage is still required, any type of CNTs and even other carbon materials can be used as supports, including the commercially available ones. The produced catalyst pellets can be of different shape and density up to ∼1 g/cm3 and the particle size in these catalysts can be tuned by varying the synthesis conditions. The SPS iron-based catalysts show high activity in CO2 hydrogenation without pre-activation (pre-reduction) in contrast to the conventional catalysts synthesized by the impregnation of carbon supports [8,10,52,66]. Finally, the catalysts studied in our work demonstrate close or higher activities at lower H2:CO2 ratio and noticeably higher selectivity to C2+ hydrocarbons than the catalysts produced in Refs. [64,65] (Table S1)."
9,Conclusions,"SPS of the CNT supported iron catalysts transforms oxide nanoparticles on the support surface into metal iron nanocrystals. These nanocrystals are embedded into a dense framework of CNTs and part of them are covered with carbon shells. The SPS treatment simultaneously reduced, activated, and compacted the catalyst making it highly efficient in CO2 hydrogenation without pre-reduction. At the same time, rather high hydrogenation temperature of 350 °C and the presence of hydrogen in the reaction mixture led to the methanation of carbon shells during catalytic tests. As a result, a huge amount of magnetite was detected in the used catalysts by XRD, XPS, and TEM. The sintered catalysts showed high activities of 5.4–12.2 molCO2gFe −1s−1 and promising C2+ selectivities of ∼40–50 mol. % at low H2:CO2 ratios of 1 and 2 without pre-reduction. High efficiency of the catalysts was attributed to their high density that led to stronger metal-support interaction, which, in its turn, intensified carbidization and CO activation. The carbon support in contrast to the oxide one prevents the formation of inactive irreducible complex oxides and promotes catalyst activation. The supercritical conditions probably enhance CO2 hydrogenation and remove possible diffusion limitations. The formation of the active Hägg carbide in the sintered catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation was detected by XRD and magnetometry. Stability of the sintered catalysts against particle migration was attributed to the framework structure of densely packed CNTs that hinders mobility of iron-containing particles. Promotion of the sintered catalysts may further increase their selectivities which in combination with low H2/CO2 ratio should reduce the cost of the process and make it more suitable for large-scale application. Though the supercritical conditions used in this work are harsher than those commonly used in the Fischer-Tropsch industry, such benefits as lower H2/CO2 ratio, higher hydrocarbon selectivity and enhanced productivity, improved diffusion/dissolving properties of the substrate, and high ecological importance of the process should outweigh the increased cost of equipment. The synthesized framework materials are promising not only for CO2 hydrogenation but also for other heterogeneous catalytic processes, electrocatalysis, microwave adsorption, and energy storage."
