0,Experimental,"In a typical oxidation procedure employing R. ruber, lyophilized cells (0.6g) were rehydrated in phosphate buffer (6.0ml, 50mM, pH 8.0) for 30min at 30°C. Co-substrate acetone (1.0ml+2.0ml after 6h) and substrate rac-2-octanol (1.0g, 7.7mmol) were added and the mixture was shaken at 30°C for 16h. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc, the solvent was removed and the products were analyzed by GC using a chiral stationary phase. In a typical analytical oxidation procedure employing E. coli/ADH-‘A’ lyophilized cells of E. coli Tuner™ (DE3)/pET22b+-ADH-‘A’ (2mg) were rehydrated in Tris-buffer (500μl, pH 7.5, 50mM) for 1h at 30°C in Eppendorf tubes (1.5ml) by shaking at 130rpm. Substrate (10μl) and acetone (100μl, 1.7mmol) was added and the mixture was agitated at 30°C (130rpm) for 2h. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc, the solvent was removed and the products were analyzed by GC using a chiral stationary phase. The cultivation of the E. coli over-expressing ADH-‘A’ and its optimization will be published in due course. The diols and reference compounds were prepared and analyzed as previously reported [48]."
