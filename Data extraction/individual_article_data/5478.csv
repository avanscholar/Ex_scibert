0,Introduction,"Oilfield operations usually include an acidizing procedure that consists of the injection of an acidic solution (hydrochloric, acetic, formic, and sulfamic acids, for example) to promote well productivity. This process is necessary because of obstructions in the rocky matrix caused by the mineral build-up, which reduce the well capacity. These acids are combined in a concentration range of 5–35%, depending on the mineral composition of the well [1]. Although acidizing a well can increase its permeability, the risk of severe corrosion damage of the metallic materials must be considered [2]. The use of inhibitors is one technique commonly used for the protection of various types of steel from corrosion [3–10]. Inhibiting molecules must contain structural characteristics that favor metallic adsorption in acid environments, and functional groups that contain heteroatoms, a high electron density in electron donating atoms, p-type molecular orbitals, a large size to guarantee efficient coating, aromatic rings, conjugated double bonds, a suitable bond length between the metallic surface and substrate, and solubility in the medium are among the important properties that have been identified [11–14]. The adsorption process depends on several factors such as the concentration, volume, temperature, the chemical composition of the solution and organic fluid, pH, flow velocity, and general solubility [15,16]. Under the severe temperature, pressure, and pH conditions found in off-shore operations, the best performance is observed for formulations that contain auxiliary constituents such as intensifiers [17], surfactants [18], and solvents [19–21]. However, their development is time-consuming and requires significant capital investment on the part of industry. Most literature regarding corrosion inhibition concerns the action of single compounds. However, when used separately, these inhibitors are usually not sufficiently effective for industrial applications [19]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop multicomponent inhibiting formulations containing active components that synergistically protect the materials used in oil well production [22]. In addition, literature reports concerning corrosion inhibitors for oil well acidizing generally involve only HCl media [23–25]. In this sense, there are few studies that address the evaluation of corrosion inhibitors that meet industry standards in terms of general requirements and corrosion rates for organic acid media. This could be explained by the extremely unusual characteristics of the organic media compared to commonly used inorganic media (HCl, H2SO4, and HF). The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of combining propargyl alcohol (PA), octadecylamine (ODA), and 1,3-dibutyl thiourea (DBTU) into a formulation (F) with commonly used auxiliaries, such as solvents and surfactants [22]. The inhibition efficiency of this formulation was evaluated in an organic acidic solution to demonstrate the synergistic effect, when combined appropriately, of three low-cost commercial products that are readily available. The efficiency of the formulation was calculated using electrochemical and alternating temperature gravimetric methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to examine the surface morphology of the steel, confirming the protective character of the formulation developed."
1,Experimental,
2,Inhibiting formulations,"2.1 Inhibiting formulations Organic compounds alone are usually not effective for corrosion control, and a mixture containing additional intensifiers, surfactants, solvents, and co-solvents is required. On the other hand, existing reports generally concern the use of a single compound as a corrosion inhibitor. However, these single compounds, when used alone, are usually not sufficiently effective for industrial applications. Some authors have reported the use of more than one compound in inhibitor formulations, such as cinnamaldehyde and propargyl alcohol [26], formaldehyde and phenol [27], and aniline and formaldehyde [28]. Thus, in this study, we also employed more than one active substance in the formulation. The active substances used in the formulation (F) were propargyl alcohol (PA), octadecylamine (ODA), and 1,3-dibutyl thiourea (DBTU). Because ODA and DBTU are solids, it was necessary to find solvents for these substances. DBTU was tested using the following solvents: N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, PA, butyl glycol, and ethylene glycol. For ODA, the solvents used were cyclohexanone, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide. We also used a mutual solvent (butyl glycol) and a surfactant (ethoxylated nonylphenol) in the formulation (F)."
3,FT-IR,"2.2 FT-IR The active substances (PA, ODA, and DBTU) and the organic formulation (F) were analyzed using a NICOLET 6700 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) at a temperature of 20°C. In total, 20 scans were collected in the range of 4000 to 400cm−1 at a resolution of 4.00cm−1."
4,Gravimetric corrosion analysis,"2.3 Gravimetric corrosion analysis Carbon steel, API P110, with the following composition (wt%) was used: C, 0.280; Mn, 1.220; Si, 0.280; P, 0.016; S, 0.002; Ni, 0.010; Mo, 0.110; and Fe, 98.1. The test samples, having dimensions 8mm×20mm×5mm with a 3-mm central orifice, were tested in a 300-mL autoclave from 353 to 393K, for 5 and 24h in both steady and dynamic regimes. The acidification tests were carried out with isolated active substances and with the formulation (F) containing the active substances, as well as the mutual solvent (butyl glycol) and a surfactant. The concentration of the formulation was 1% (wt/v %). The mass loss was used to calculate the uniform corrosion rate according to ASTM G31 [29]."
5,Acid solution,2.4 Acid solution The aqueous acidic fluid with 12% (v/v) concentration was prepared with a mixture of 99.7% acetic acid (analytical grade) and 85% formic acid (analytical grade).
6,Effect of storage time,2.5 Effect of storage time The storage time was evaluated after a period of 214days to analyze the aging effects on the inhibiting agent.
7,Electrochemical analysis,"2.6 Electrochemical analysis Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a conventional three-electrode cylindrical glass cell at 353±1K. A silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl) and a large-area platinum wire were used as the reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. Before each electrochemical measurement, the open-circuit potential (OCP) was recorded as a function of time for up to 30min. After 30min, a steady-state OCP corresponding to the corrosion potential (E corr) of the working electrode was obtained. The anodic and cathodic polarization curves were obtained separately at a scan rate of 0.333mVs−1 in the anodic and cathodic directions (E = E corr ±250mV). A scan rate of 0.333mVs−1 was used to generate a linear polarization resistance (LPR) at +15mV and −15mV against the E corr. The scan rate used is considered a low scan rate and was used to observe the reaction stages clearly. Many previous works have chosen the same scan rate [30–33]. The procedures above were repeated for each concentration of inhibitor. The electrochemical experiments were performed using a computer-controlled instrument (Autolab Potentiostat/Galvanostat (PGSTAT302)) with the NOVA 1.11 software provided by Autolab used for polarization curves and linear polarization resistance, respectively."
8,Surface analysis - scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy,"2.7 Surface analysis - scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy The API P110 carbon steel surface was analyzed by SEM using a JEOL JSM 6460LB instrument with an acceleration voltage of 15kV. The samples were submitted to corrosion tests with and without the inhibitor (1.0% wt/v) at 373K for 24h. Samples were then washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried. One of the samples, for which the purpose was to confirm the presence of the inhibitor film on the surface, was not washed before analysis. Carbon steel samples with and without the inhibiting formulation were also analyzed via confocal laser scanning microscopy. This instrument was a ZEISS LSM 800 MAT with Zen 2.3 Blue edition software."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Development of the formulation,"3.1 Development of the formulation 3.1.1 Solubility of the active substances The active substances, ODA and DBTU, are insoluble in water and have reduced solubility in conventional solvents. The solubilization of ODA is challenging because it is a fatty amine, and ketones were the only efficient solvents among those tested. DBTU shows decreasing solubility in the following solvents: N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, PA, butyl glycol, and ethylene glycol. The Hansen solubility parameters (δT) may give a better understanding of the solubility of ODA and DBTU. This parameter consists of the sum of three parts: a dispersion coefficient (δD), dipolar intermolecular forces (δP), and hydrogen bonds (δH). Thus, compounds with similar δT values are normally capable of forming mixtures that result in a better extraction efficiency of the solvents and solutes [34]. An estimate of the Hansen parameters for ODA and DBTU are shown in Fig. 1 [34]. The solvents tested for ODA are alcohol, nitrile, amide, and sulfoxide classes and none had results as close as those obtained with cyclohexanone (ketone). The ketones are the only solvent class that has both δP and δH close to the values of the amine group. This indicates that cyclohexanone is the only viable solvent for ODA. The solvents for DBTU are amides, sulfoxides, alcohols, and glycols, decreasing in their solubility in that order. The most compatible solvents with DBTU have a larger value of δP and a lower value of δH when compared to the non-compatible solvents. This brings DBTU closer to the amide and dimethyl sulfoxide regions. Although it does not have the best performance as a solvent for DBTU, propargyl alcohol (PA) has other interesting functions in the overall formulation. PA is the most efficient corrosion inhibitor derivative with a hydroxy acetylene group in acidic media [35], and it is also the main constituent of the inhibitor present in the patent US 4698168 [36]. Therefore, PA was selected as a substance that can solubilize DBTU, but it also acts as an active substance. The solutions of ODA and DBTU were stable at room temperature, but, when added to the mixture containing the aqueous acidic fluid, small crystals were formed, resulting in a biphasic (solid-liquid) or triphasic (two immiscible liquids and suspended particles) system. To increase the stability of the mixture, we added a surfactant. This nonionic surfactant is an ethoxylated fatty alcohol that prevents the formation of precipitates in the formulation in the presence of organic acids. Another component of the formulation is butyl glycol, which has the function of a mutual solvent for all components of the formulation. There is also another solvent in the formulation, cyclohexanone, whose function is to solubilize octadecylamine. It is important to note that the substances that act as corrosion inhibitors are PA, ODA, and DBTU. The surfactant and the solvents (butyl glycol and cyclohexanone) do not protect the material. For this reason, they are included in the category “Others” in Table 1 , and their mass percent in the formulation is 40%: 8% of the surfactant, 22% of butyl glycol, and 10% of cyclohexanone. The percentage of each constituent in the formulation is shown in Table 1. The concentration of the formulation (F) used in the organic fluid was 1% wt/v and the concentration (% wt/v) of the active substances in the acidic fluid is also shown in Table 1. It is important to highlight that Finsgar and Jackson [19] have studied many formulation constituents and among them, there are solvents and surfactants. According to these authors, solvents are mainly used for two purposes: to reduce the viscosity for ease of handling and to ensure formulation stability in various environments. Indeed, the solvents have a similar function to the surfactants but with a different mechanism, acting by improving the corrosion inhibitor formulation solubility and dispersibility in the acid and its wettability on the acid–steel interface. In addition, one of the most used solvents for this purpose is butyl glycol, which is part of the formulation developed. 3.1.2 Inhibiting formulation characterization (FT-IR) The infrared absorption spectra of the active substances (PA, ODA, and DBTU), and the formulation F are shown in Fig. 2 . In the infrared spectra of PA (Fig. 2(a)), there is a sharp, broad peak at 3293cm−1 that corresponds to an OH group, a weak band near 2927cm−1 that corresponds to the CH2 stretching vibration, and a sharp band at 2120cm−1 that confirms the presence of triple bond in the molecule [37]. Fig. 2(b) shows the spectrum of ODA. The peak at 3332cm−1 is derived from NH stretching vibrations, and that at 1607cm−1 corresponds to the NH bending vibration. The peaks at 2918 and 2849cm−1 are related to CH CSP 3 axial stretching, and that at 1473cm−1 is derived from the CH2 bending vibrations. Fig. 2(c) presents the spectrum of DBTU that contains peaks related to NH stretching from the amide at 3090 and 3218cm−1, peaks related to CN stretching at 1162 and 1278cm−1, and peaks that correspond to CS stretching at 1048 and 1216cm−1. The spectrum of the inhibiting formulation (F) is shown in Fig. 2(d). This spectrum contains the characteristic peaks of the constituents, whose spectra have been discussed in this section. The peak corresponding to the OH group at 3294cm−1 is not sharp because of the presence of other substances, and the vibration of the triple bond in PA is present at 2118cm−1. The peak at 1630cm−1 is derived from NH bending vibrations related to the presence of ODA. The peaks at 1035, 1118, and 1226cm−1 belong to CS stretching and, at 1297cm−1, to CN stretching, which confirms the presence of DBTU. Therefore, the presence of the mentioned peaks confirms the composition of the formulation, and some of the peaks displacements are attributed to the mixture of substances."
11,Gravimetric analysis,"3.2 Gravimetric analysis 3.2.1 Isolated active substances Acidizing tests were performed with the isolated active substances (PA, ODA, and DBTU) in a steady regime at 353K (Fig. 3 ). The concentrations of the active substances tested in the acidic fluid were the same as when present in the formulation to enable the evaluation of the performance and contribution of each constituent of the formulation; that is, 0.30% wt/v PA, 0.07% wt/v ODA, and 0.20% wt/v DBTU. We observed that PA and ODA, in spite of their high efficiencies, have corrosion rates above the acceptable level (200mpy) of acidizing operations, whereas DBTU has good inhibiting properties. Previous studies have already reported the use of nitrogen compounds similar to ODA [38], acetylenic alcohols (including PA) [39,40], and sulfur compounds, such as thioureas and their derivatives [41–45]. Torres et al. [45], when studying thioureas, found efficiencies of 93% in aqueous media (HCl) at room temperature, and Dehri and Ozcan [41] investigated the use of methyl thiourea and phenylthiourea in 0.1M H2SO4 at 323K resulting in 90 and 96.9% efficiencies, respectively. The substance with the highest protective characteristics is DBTU, arising from the presence of nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms in its structure. When considering the efficiency contribution of each type of heteroatom, the following efficiency order is found: O<N<S<P [11]. Thus, DBTU should show the highest corrosion efficiency as a result of having different heteroatoms and, specifically, a sulfur heteroatom in its structure. The active substances were then combined, forming the inhibiting formulation (F). The corrosion rates and efficiency are shown in Fig. 3. There is a reduction of approximately 50% in the corrosion rate when comparing multicomponent formulation F to DBTU, further indicating the synergism and the importance of combining corrosion inhibitors in formulations. The corrosion inhibition is mainly due to the adsorption of the studied compounds preceded by the displacement of water molecules at the carbon steel/acetic+formic acid solution boundary. It also indicates that the improved performance of the formulation compared to those of the isolated active substances may derive from the stronger chemical adsorption and better surface coverage of the formulation. The inhibition is essentially based on the coverage of the metal surface by the inhibitor molecules, thus making contact with the corroding species difficult [46]. Because the formulation combines three active substances, a greater surface area is covered than that with the individual substances. In addition, the active substances have different anchoring points to the surface, which results in a synergistic effect. 3.2.2 Storage time for corrosion inhibitor F The effect of storage time of the formulation (F) was tested over 214days to evaluate if the efficiencies remained high after a long period of storage (Fig. 4 ). In comparison with a recently prepared (0 to 12days) formulation, the older formulation (from 62days onwards) showed a reduction in corrosion rate. This shows that there is no loss in the inhibiting efficiency on storage; in contrast, there is an actual improvement over time. Thus, the storage of the inhibiting formulation is possible and will not affect its protective properties. 3.2.3 Effect of temperature An increase in temperature is expected to intensify the corrosion processes and, as such, temperature is an important state variable to be analyzed [47]. The effect of temperature was investigated using formulation F and a system without the inhibitor. A corrosion rate of 200mpy was used as the evaluation criterion for a good inhibition process because it has been reported by different authors to be an acceptable corrosion rate for aggressive acidizing fluids [48–50]. Table 2 lists the results from 353 to 393K. A temperature increase, in the blank system, from 353 to 363K increased the corrosion rate over 10.000mpy. Above 373K, blank corrosion rate calculations became impossible because of the total mass loss of the test samples. This shows the aggressiveness of the acidic medium. Formulation F maintained its inhibition characteristics through temperature increases while also keeping the corrosion rate under the desired value of 200mpy. These results are of the same magnitude as other references, although the high temperatures investigated in this work have not been reported in the literature [51,52]. The corrosion of metal in acidic solution is generally accompanied by the evolution of molecular H2; accordingly, increasing the temperature accelerates the corrosion reactions, resulting in a higher dissolution/corrosion rate of the metal. Likewise, the corrosion inhibition was sustained to a greater extent at elevated temperature. This provides strong evidence that the chemical adsorption mainly dominates over the dissolution of metal resulting in strong interaction between the active substances present in the formulation and the metal surface [53]. The relation between temperature and corrosion rate can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation: (2) logCr = − E a 2.303 RT + logλ in which, E a represents the apparent activation energy, λ is the pre-exponential factor, R the absolute gas constant, and C r is the corrosion rate. The activation energy was calculated by plotting logC R versus 1/T, and this plot is shown in Fig. 5 . The value of E a for the inhibiting formulation was obtained from the angular coefficient and is around 28.76kJ/mol. This value is comparable to those of other studies [54] and indicates a high energetic barrier for corrosion in the presence of the inhibitor. 3.2.4 Effect of concentration and adsorption isotherm The selection of inhibitors for an acidic medium depends on the nature of the acids, the acid concentration, temperature, flow velocity, the presence of organic/inorganic substances, and the nature of the metal. Joia et al. [48] suggested a concentration of 2% wt./v of the active substance for addition to the acidic solution used in the well acidizing operation. This value is within limits imposed by lethal dose at 50% (LD50) toxicology reports. The chosen concentration for formulation F was 1% wt/v, half of the suggested concentration, and a high efficiency was observed. The concentration was then varied between the lower and upper limits to evaluate the effects on the protection of the metal (Fig. 6 ). The tests were carried out at 353K in the steady-state regime and with an immersion time of 24h. No significant difference in the formulation efficiency was observed, and all concentrations retained >98% efficiency and corrosion rates of <200mpy. Between 1.5 and 2.0% wt/v, there was practically no change in the corrosion rate. This can be explained as follows: the primary action of inhibition is the adsorption of the inhibitors onto the mild steel surface. An increase in the concentration of the inhibitor led to the gradual formation of multilayers, which further reduced the rate of corrosion beyond that achieved by monolayer coverage below that concentration [55]. In this work, only minor changes in the efficiency were observed at higher formulation concentrations. This is because, above a particular concentration, only additional coverage beyond the monolayer results, which is already sufficient for significant inhibition. Although an increase to 1.5% (wt/v) showed a small improvement in the corrosion rate, 1% (wt/v) was the chosen concentration for all further tests because it guarantees industry standard corrosion rates and does not require excessive amounts of the inhibiting formulation, reducing the overall cost. Organic molecules inhibit corrosion by preventing water molecules from reaching the metallic surface. This depends on the molecular charge, nature and electronic characteristics of the metallic surface, temperature, solvent adsorption, presence of ions, electrochemical potential, and solution interface. Adsorption isotherms were collected to describe the adsorption behavior of the organic compounds and to help us understand the mechanism of action. The inhibiting molecules were investigated by using Langmuir, Temkin, and Frumkin isotherms. The isotherm equations are shown in Eqs. (3)–(5) [50,54,56]. (3) C inh θ = 1 K ads + C inh Langmuir Isotherm (4) log θ C inh = log k ads + gθ Temkin Isotherm (5) log θ 1 − θ C inh = log k ads + gθ Frumkin Isotherm Here, K ads is the adsorption equilibrium constant, C inh is the inhibitor concentration, θ is the fraction of the metallic surface covered by the inhibitor, and g is the degree of lateral interaction between adsorbed molecules. The best fit was obtained with the Langmuir isotherm (Fig. 7 ), having an R2 of 0.996, followed by the Frumkin isotherm, having an R2 of 0.952, and Temkin isotherm, having an R2 of 0.906. The applicability of Langmuir's isotherm confirms that the organic molecules are adsorbed on the adsorbent in a monolayer; that is, the adsorbed molecules occupy only one site, preventing interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent [56]. The adsorption equilibrium constant (K ads) can be related to the adsorption free energy via Eq. (6): (6) ∆ G ads 0 = − RT ln 55.5 K ads , where R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The value 55.5 is the water concentration in the solution expressed in moles per liter. From Eq. (6), the calculated value of ∆G ads 0 is −26.6kJ/mol. The negative values of ∆G ads 0indicate spontaneous adsorption. In addition to this, adsorption is considered physical if│∆G ads 0│<20kJ/mol and chemical if │∆G ads 0│>40kJmol-1. Because the calculated ∆G ads is in between these values, adsorption occurs both physically and chemically [54]. 3.2.5 Dynamic corrosion tests Dynamic corrosive tests were carried out in a rotating cell at two different exposure times, 5 and 24h, with 1% wt/v of the formulation F to simulate more realistic fluid movement. The corrosion rates were 212 and 440mpy, respectively. This shows that carbon steel suffers a more accentuated corrosive process with longer exposure times. This is not only due to the longer contact with the corrosive medium but also the shear stress caused by fluid movement. Comparing the results with and without agitation, it can be concluded that agitation has a strong influence on the inhibitor, and this can be explained either by reducing or removing the protective film or increasing the corrosion rate. Because adsorption occurs both physically and chemically, the removal of physically adsorbed molecules is facilitated under sufficient shear stress. This can be avoided by rigid fluid velocity control, which hinders the removal of the physically adsorbed protective layer, or by lowering exposition times of the inhibitor formulation."
12,Electrochemical analysis,"3.3 Electrochemical analysis 3.3.1 Open circuit potential The variation in the open circuit potential (E OCP) over time, for the API P110 carbon steel in an acidic organic medium with different concentrations of the inhibiting formulation F, is shown in Fig. 8 . The E OCP curves shift in the positive direction in the presence of different concentrations of the formulation. The difference in E OCP in the absence and presence of the formulation indicates that the API P110 surface was covered and protected by the inhibitor adsorption. Inspection of Fig. 8 also revealed an initial sharp increase in corrosion potential with increasing immersion time, up to approximately 250s (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0% wt./v) and 550s (1.5% wt/v). The curve of the solution without the formulation reached a more stable E OCP after 1000s, and this must be related to the active corrosive reactions occurring at the steel surface. After this time, a gradual increase in E OCP was observed until a stable value was obtained. The OCP of the different concentrations reached a steady state after 12min, suggesting that the formulation had adsorbed on the carbon steel surface, forming a protective film. However, there was no significant difference in E OCP with concentration, and this may correspond to the excellent protective characteristics of the formulation, even at low concentrations. Based on literature reports, it is possible to classify an inhibitor as anodic or cathodic if the shift of E OCP in the presence of an inhibitor relative to the blank is ±85mV [25]. However, the positive shift in E OCP in the presence of the formulation is about 50mV. This indicates that both anodic steel dissolution and cathodic hydrogen evolution were inhibited by the active substances, which work synergistically in the formulation; that is, the formulation functions as a mixed-type corrosion inhibitor. 3.3.2 Linear polarization resistance measurements Linear polarization resistance (LPR) plots for carbon steel with and without different concentrations of the inhibitor formulation are shown in Fig. 9 . The main advantage of this electrochemical technique is that it is the only corrosion monitoring method that allows corrosion rates to be measured directly, in real time, as well as being nondestructive. A polarizing voltage of 15mV was chosen because it is well within the limits for which the linear relationship between i corr and E holds. In addition, the polarization voltage is sufficiently small to cause no significant or permanent disruption of the corrosion process; thus, the subsequent measurements remain valid [25]. The polarization resistance (R p) was estimated by using the angular coefficient of the potential (E) versus current density (i), measured using the corrosion potential (E corr). The inhibition efficiency (E lpr) was estimated from the value of R p in Eq. (7), and the values are listed in Table 3 . (7) E lpr = R p − R p 0 R p × 100 R p and R p 0 represent the polarization resistance with and without inhibiting formulation F, respectively. The data listed in Table 3 show that polarization resistance increased in the presence of the inhibiting formulation, confirming that formulation F acts as a good inhibitor for API P-110 steel corrosion in the strong corrosive medium. The inhibiting formulation shows high values of R p at all concentrations. Indeed, the values of R p increased as the formulation concentration increased, showing a significant elevation when the concentration increased from 1.0 to 1.5% wt./v (R p =416.44Ώcm2 and R p =788Ώcm2, respectively). The maximum polarization resistance value of 825.74Ώcm2 was obtained at the concentration 2.0% wt/v. However, a small efficiency difference was obtained on increasing the concentration, which means that the formulation F is effective even at low concentrations. The presence of three active substances contributes towards inhibition process because of the sulfur atom (1,3-dibutyl thiourea), the hydrophobic chain of octadecylamine, and the π bonds (propargyl alcohol) in these active substances. A comparison between the E lpr inhibition efficiency and gravimetric inhibition efficiency shows that the values are in good agreement, confirming that the formulation acts as a good inhibitor. 3.3.3 Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurements To determine the kinetics of the anodic and cathodic reactions, we carried out polarization experiments. PDP plots for carbon steel in the presence and absence of F are shown in Fig. 10 . The corrosion current density (I corr) and the corrosion potential (E corr) were estimated (Table 4 ). According to Badea et al. [57–59], two rules should be applied when using Tafel extrapolation. For an accurate extrapolation, at least one of branches of the polarization curve should exhibit Tafel behavior (i.e., linear on a semilogarithmic scale) over at least one decade of current density. In addition, the extrapolation should start at least 50 to 100mV away from E corr. Because there are two anodic reactions, as indicated by Fig. 10, it is not advisable to use Tafel extrapolation. However, some considerations can be made based on the I corr and E corr displacement, as well as anodic and cathodic branches. In acidic solutions, the anodic reaction is the movement of metal ions from the working electrode into the solution, and the cathodic reaction is the discharge of hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas or a reduction in the concentration of oxygen. The inhibitor may affect either the anodic or the cathodic reaction or both. A close examination of Fig. 10 reveals that the addition of the formulation to acetic+formic acidic fluid affects both the anodic and cathodic parts of the curve. The cathodic curves exhibit a well-defined Tafel region; on the other hand, the anodic curves indicate the existence of two types of reaction, as mentioned before. Nevertheless, there is a clear displacement of both curves to higher potentials when compared to the blank, once again showing the protective nature of the inhibitors. In addition, the corrosion current density, I corr, decreased noticeably at the lowest concentration of inhibitor, which suggests that the formulation behaves as a very good corrosion inhibitor, even at low concentrations. Moreover, the shape of the branches is not similar to the plots of the blank solution, which suggests the corrosion mechanism is changed by the addition of the formulation. Jayaperumal [60] studied PA in 15% HCl as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel at 303 and 378K. The potentiodynamic polarization revealed two steps in the anodic reaction, the same as observed in this work. Jayaperumal affirmed that, in the presence of acetylenic alcohols, corrosion is inhibited by adsorption of the organic molecules on the metal surface and the protection by the acetylenic alcohol is generally enhanced by the presence of iron ions. This is explained by the participation of iron ions in the condensation and polymerization reactions, leading to the production of surface films [61]. Therefore, some authors have proposed a multilayer formation mechanism because of the polymerization of acetylenic compounds from IR studies; others suggest the formation of a multilayer stabilized by both π- and hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, a three-dimensional chelate made of ferrous ions and inhibitor molecules over the metal solution boundary layer has been suggested [62]. Quraishi [63] has explained that the inhibitors prevent the corrosion of steel in hydrochloric acid by adsorption on the metal surface through their π-electrons. Possibly, because the mechanism of interaction of PA and the surface is complicated, the anodic reaction occurs in more than one step. As shown in Table 4, the corrosion current density I corr decreased noticeably in the presence of the formulation, but the concentration of the formulation (F) did not affect I corr significantly, indicating that the formulation behaves as a very good inhibitor. Moreover, the current density diminished markedly compared to the absence of inhibitor, which demonstrates that the inhibiting formulation was adsorbed on the metal surface, blocking charge transfer. Therefore, the inhibiting mechanism can be thought as the adsorption of 1,3-dibutyl thiourea and propargyl alcohol at the metal/solution interface to form a protective film, which separates the metal surface from the corrosive medium. The octadecylamine creates a hydrophobic layer and contributes to the replacement of water molecules for propargyl alcohol and dibutyl thiourea adsorption. Generally, the addition of the inhibitor can make E corr move in both directions. If the displacement of E corr is <85mV, the compound is classified as a mixed-type inhibitor. As shown in Table 4, the largest displacement of the E corr was 39mV, suggesting that the formulation acted as a mixed-type inhibitor, as suggested by the OCP measurements. In this sense, the formulation acts by reducing the anodic dissolution of the carbon steel and slowing the cathodic hydrogen evolution by blocking the active sites [64]. Moreover, the values are in good agreement with the LPR and weight loss measurements."
13,Morphology studies,"3.4 Morphology studies The images of the surface of the carbon steel with and without the inhibitor were obtained using SEM, and the surface composition was determined through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12 . The surface of the steel immersed in a blank solution is very rough and non-uniform compared to the steel immersed in a solution containing an inhibitor (Figs. 11(b) and (c)) and indicates severe and uniform corrosion. The steel surface with the protective film (Fig. 11(c)) very much resembles the steel before immersion in the acidic fluid (Fig. 11(a)), characterized by a relatively smooth and regular surface. The protective film can be observed in Fig. 11(d) and is distributed randomly on the overall surface of the mild steel. The images further reinforce the observation that the low corrosion rates are due to the adsorption of the inhibitor and result in the formation of a protective film with the reactive sites of mild steel surface, decreasing the contact between mild steel and the aggressive medium, which resulted in the excellent inhibition effect. The EDS composition analysis shows an increase in the percentage of carbon and oxygen in the presence of the inhibitor, as shown in Fig. 12(d). This increase is due to the inhibitor and is in agreement with the mass loss and microscopy results. The confocal laser scanning microscopy results confirm the severe attack by the acidic medium on the steel surface (Fig. 13 (a.1)). The profile is shown in Fig. 13(a.2) and illustrates the variable topography of the sample. As shown, certain regions have a maximum attack depth of 40μm (Fig. 13(a.3)). Clearly, as shown in Fig. 13(b.1), there is a more uniform surface arising from the protective effect of the inhibitor. This uniform characteristic can be seen in the topographical profile in Fig. 13(b.2), in which the depth of attack is of approximately 5μm (Fig. 13(b.3)). This result corroborates the SEM analysis, showing that the presence of the inhibitor results in a more uniform surface as compared to the surface without the inhibitor."
14,Conclusions,"The efficiency of the active substances increases in the following order: ODA<PA<DBTU. The efficiency of inhibiting formulation F is higher than the isolated active substances and increased after 214days of storage. This confirms the synergism of the active substances when combined into the formulation, which remain stable in the acidic organic fluid by the interactions with a mutual solvent and a surfactant, demonstrating the importance of the selection of the formulation components. The inhibiting formulation (F) maintains its inhibition potential with corrosion rates under the industry standard of 200mpy well beyond 373K, despite the aggressiveness of the acidic organic fluid. The protective effects of the inhibitor are profoundly influenced by agitation because of the removal or reduction of the formed protective film. The efficiency calculated from the linear polarization resistance was in good agreement with the gravimetric analysis and potentiodynamic polarization. An increase in the concentration of F resulted in larger R p values, indicating better surface protection, although the lowest concentration evaluated has an excellent inhibiting efficiency. The cathodic and anodic polarizations showed curve shifting to lower current density values. The formulation can be described as a mixed-type inhibitor. The high protection efficiency is directly linked to the protective mechanisms of the active substances present in the formulation. Therefore, high inhibiting efficiencies can be obtained from the combination of available substances in an adequate mass proportion in the development of organic inhibiting formulations."
