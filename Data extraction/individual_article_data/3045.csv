0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered to be one of the most significant clean fuels in future because of its pollution-free and sustainable properties. Photolysis of water for hydrogen production has attracted wide attention due to its non-pollution process [1–5]. Now, many kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts (e.g. TiO2 [6], ZnO [7], Bi2WO6 [8], BiOBr [9]) have been reported in hydrogen production by water decomposition under sunlight. Among these semiconductors, ZnO have attracted wide attention due to their environmental friendliness, excellent stability and low cost [10–12]. However, for the single ZnO, the large size and broad band gap will reduce the utilization of visible light and increase charge recombination rate, which leads to a poor photocatalytic performance [13,14]. Recently, a plenty of methods have been developed to overcome the above shortness, such as heterostructure constructing, element doping, cocatalyst loading and morphological control [15–18]. Among these methods, the nano structure can narrow the band gap of the ZnO, achieve the visible light response and provide the higher surface area to greatly increase the reaction sites for the photocatalytic H2 production by the morphological control [19,20]. Moreover, the bandgap of ZnO can also be adjusted by doping non-metal or transition metal (C, N or S) to form the Shockley junctions or introduce the structural vacancies [21–23]. In addition, the introduction of vacancies can enhance the electron density of Fermi energy level, which contributes to the charge transfer and separation [24]. However, the traditional methods to dope the elements into ZnO or fabricate the nanoscale ZnO still suffer from the complicated synthetic process and inevitable aggregation situation [25–27]. Therefore, developing the more effective synthetic strategy to obtain a nanoscale D-doped ZnO (D represent the doped elements) is urgently needed. As we all know, noble metals have been widely used because of their localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) effect and relatively stable chemical properties. Copper is considered to be an ideal material to replace precious metals in the field of photocatalysis due to its low price and good optical properties. Due to their porosity and tunability of organic linkers and metal coordination center, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential application in many fields [19,28,29]. In recent years, using MOFs as platform for the synthesis of composites is developed rapidly because of their compositional and structural diversities [19]. Such diverse features can integrate MOF materials with multiple elements and furtherly design the materials with desired properties [19]. MOFs have been demonstrated to be very useful precursors and templates for the fabrication of the nanoscale carbon [30] and carbon decorated MO (MO represents the metal oxide) quantum dots [31] by taking advantage of the long-range ordering at the molecular level. MOF-5 is a typical MOF material which exhibits the considerable potential application in catalytic organic reactions owing to its remarkable larger pore volume, large surface area and relative high thermal stability. Herein, the nanoscale C-doped ZnO precursor was firstly obtained by using MOF-5 as the precursor. The obtained C-doped ZnO was then decorated by Cu (Cu0) through a photo-reduction method. Due to the synergistic effect of the nanoscale structures and the doping of C as well as the loading of Cu cocatalyst, the prepared Cu/C–ZnO photocatalyst showed the outstanding visible-light response, enhanced charge separation efficiency, and led to the excellent H2 production rates under the irradiation of visible light."
1,Experimental,"The Materials, Characterization were shown in the Supporting Information, and the other experimental processes were shown in the follow."
2,Synthesis of MOF-5 nano-particles,"2.1 Synthesis of MOF-5 nano-particles MOF-5 was prepared according to the methods of reference [24]. The specific procedure as follow: 0.4 g of Zn(NO3)2 ·6H2O and 0.2 g of C8H6O4 were dissolved in 20 mL of ethylene glycol (EG), and then 32 mL of N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was added which was stirred for 1 h under room temperature. The mixture was transferred into a hydrothermal reactor at 150 °C for 6 h, the product was rinsed and filtered, and the MOF-5 was finally obtained."
3,Preparation of carbon-doped ZnO loaded with Cu photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of carbon-doped ZnO loaded with Cu photocatalysts C-doped ZnO (C–ZnO) was obtained by calcination of the MOF-5 at 450 °C whose heating rate was 5 °C/min, which was signed as C–ZnO-5. In order to maintain the original octahedron morphology, the heating rate of calcination was reduced to 1 °C/min, and the sample was signed as C–ZnO-1. Cu was doped on C–ZnO by the situ photo-deposition: 0.1 g C–ZnO was added into 65 mL certain concentration Cu(CH3COOH)2 methanol solution which was put into a 300 mL quartz tank to vacuum degassing using a vacuum pump, and then a 300 w xenon lamp was used to irradiate, and the reaction was happened. Cu doped C–ZnO-5 samples with different Cu contents were signed as Cux/C–ZnO, where X represented the contents of Cu. The formation process of the Cux/C–ZnO nanocomposite was illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
4,Photocatalytic activity tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity tests Photocatalytic hydrogen production was occurred in a 100 mL closed quartz Pyrex reactor. Normally, 50 mg samples were added to a 100 mL mixed solution (25 mL methanol and 75 mL distilled water). The reactor was degassed with nitrogen to remove residual air. The photocatalytic reaction was induced by irradiation of the suspension with a 300 w xenon lamp with UV cut-off filter (<420 nm). Gas products were analyzed periodically by gas chromatograph (GC-1690, Kexiao, China) with a TCD detector."
5,Result and discussion,"XRD patterns were performed to study the phase purity and crystal structure of the prepared samples. The results were displayed in Fig. 1 a. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.8°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.7°, 56.7°, 62.8°, 66.3°, 67.9°, and 69.1° were respectively corresponded to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) planes diffractions of wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS card No. 36–1451). In addition, the diffraction peaks of Cu were not observed when the contents of Cu were 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt%. With copper content increasing, the diffraction peaks of Cu at 2θ = 40.3°and 50.5° were gradually increased (JCPDS card No. 65–9026). It proved that Cu existed in the composite material as a simple substance. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curves (inset) of the Cu5/C–ZnO and C–ZnO samples were respectively shown in Fig. 1b and Supporting Information Fig. S1, they both exhibited the type Ⅳ isotherm including a hysteresis at a high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.7) which demonstrated the existence of mesoporous structures. The pore size distribution plots of Cu5/C–ZnO (inset of Fig. 1b) further indicated that the sample had the mesoporous structures and uniform pores. Through the BET method, the specific surface area was calculated, and the pore size was calculated by BJH model. The specific surface area and pore diameter of C–ZnO were 114.660 m2/g and 2.63 nm, while the Cu5/C–ZnO were 87.082 m2/g and 2.61 nm, respectively. It could be found that the specific surface area and pore diameter of the C–ZnO sample decreased after Cu loaded, it could be attributed to which Cu was filled into pore interior. Fig. 1c showed the TG curve of C–ZnO sample, two major weight losses were showed, the weight loss at 164 °C was caused by removal of residual water and unreacted organic matter. The sample showed the 24% weight loss at 450 °C which could be attributed to the release of CO2 by C combustion. It showed that the C content was about 24% in the prepared material. Fig. 2 a–e showed the XPS spectra of C–ZnO and Cu5/C–ZnO samples. From Fig. 2a, the C–ZnO and Cu5/C–ZnO samples were composed of Zn, C, O and Zn, C, O, Cu elements, respectively. Fig. 2b showed the Zn2p spectra, the C–ZnO sample showed two Zn-2p peaks at 1020.89 and 1043.7 eV which were related to Zn2p1/2 and Zn2p3/2, the two peaks were shifted to the higher energies of 1022 and 1045 eV in Cu5/C–ZnO sample which was ascribed to the presence of defects in C–ZnO [32]. The O1s energy level spectra were shown in Fig. 2c, C–ZnO had only Zn–O peak, however, the Cu5/C–ZnO sample showed two peaks at 529.63 and 531.1 eV which were respectively belonged to the O of Zn–O and chemisorbed oxygen [33], the more oxygen vacancy existed in the Cu5/C–ZnO sample which could reduce the rate of electron hole recombination and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. Fig. 2d belonged to the XPS spectrum of C 1s, the peaks of Cu5/C–ZnO sample were located at 284.8 and 288.3 eV, the impurity peak of C corresponded to the characteristic peak at 284.8 eV, and the peak at 288.3 eV was attributed to surface loosely bound carbonate species (such as CO) or the C incorporated into the interstitial void of the ZnO lattice [34]. Due to the extraction of electron from ZnO to Cu, the electron density on the surface of Cu was increased, and the XPS spectra of Zn 2p, O 1s and C1S for Cu5/C–ZnO showed the positive shifts compare with the C–ZnO. From the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2e), the peaks at 932.6 and 952 eV separately indexed to the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, which were respectively corresponded to Cu0 and Cu+, and No characteristic peak of Cu2+ was observed at 942.5 eV. According to XRD and XPS results, copper existed in the prepared material as Cu0. The valence band (VB) diagram of C–ZnO was shown in Fig. 2f, which was generally used to confirm the VB position of semiconductors. It could be seen that the VB position of C–ZnO was about 2.32 eV [35]. Fig. 3 a–c were the SEM images of MOF-5 under different magnifications. It could be seen that the MOF-5 had the regular octahedral morphology, and the average diameter of octahedrons was about 10 μm. From Fig. 3c, it could also be seen that the surfaces of MOF-5 were deposited by small particles. The SEM images of C–ZnO, 0.1 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% Cu coated C–ZnO samples were showed in Fig. 3 d-i. It could be seen that MOF-5 disintegrated after calcination, and its morphology was much uniform small particles (Fig. 3d) whose diameter was about 273 ± 5 nm. In addition, the morphologies of Cux/C–ZnO samples were consistent with C–ZnO whose diameters all were about 77 ± 5 nm, which indicated that the morphology of C–ZnO was not changed during photo-reduction of Cu. In order to maintain the octahedron morphology, the heating rate of calcination was reduced to 1 °C/min, and Cu was loaded by the same method, the samples were marked as C–ZnO-1 and Cu5/C–ZnO-1. The SEM images of the C–ZnO-1 and Cu5/C–ZnO-1 samples were shown in Fig. S2, it could be observed that the samples keep the octahedron morphology. TEM and SAED diagrams of Cu5/C–ZnO sample were shown in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4a, it could be seen that the particles showed also the octahedron morphology rather than the spherical particles as Fig. 3h, it indicated that the calcination and photo-reduction processes led to the octahedron grains of the MOF-5 (about 10 μm) refinement to form the tiny octahedron particles (77 ± 5 nm). The possible reasons for the grain refinement were as follow: the MOF-5 particles broken up and recrystallized when the MOF-5 was tempered to remove the organic skeleton for the preparation of C–ZnO matrix, and the generated C blocked the growth of the lattices which made the grain diameter refine to 273 ± 5 nm. During the photo-reduction process, the Cu intruded into the crystal boundary which led to the breakage of the crystal particles, and the grain diameter was furtherly refined to 77 ± 5 nm. The refined nanoparticles were beneficial for the visible-light response. In nanometer-scaled structures, the spatial proximity of the band edge wave functions to the interface will lead to an increase in the oscillator strength, which plays a decisive role in obtaining of the narrow band gap and a visible‐light response from two materials with large band gap [36]. From the SADE image (Fig. 4b), the ring diffraction pattern indicated the polycrystalline nature, and the rings in the SAED pattern could be attributed to the (200) and (111) planes of the Cu phase, it proved that the Cu was coated on the surfaces of the C–ZnO. Fig. 5 a–d showed the EDS elemental distributed images of C–ZnO sample, it could be seen that the elements C, Zn and O were uniformly distributed on the surface of the sample, and it could be inferred that C-doped ZnO was successfully prepared. The EDS elemental distributed images of the Cu5/C–ZnO sample were employed as Fig. 5e–i, the Cu element was uniformly distributed on the surface of the sample, which confirmed that Cu had been loaded on the surface of C–ZnO, successfully. The photocatalytic performances of the prepared samples were evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. The hydrogen production performances of pure ZnO, C–ZnO-1, C–ZnO-5 and Cux/C–ZnO catalysts were shown in Fig. 6 a，the hydrogen production efficiency of C–ZnO-5 sample was higher than that of C–ZnO-1. It could be attributed to which the C–ZnO-1 sample maintained the much bigger regular octahedron structure (10 μm) of MOF-5, the lower defect concentration was existed in the C–ZnO-1 sample, and the electrons were easier to recombine with holes than the sample C–ZnO-5 (octahedron particle diameter 273 ± 5 nm). Therefore, the wide band-gap materials had a photocatalytic response under visible light, which could be attributed to their nanostructures. The copper element shows the same plasma resonance effect as the noble metals which exhibits an LSPR absorbance at 600 nm which can promote the photocatalysis for many applications, it can provide the active sites for the formation of hydrogen, and the hydrogen evolution rate is remarkably improved after the copper loading [37]. When the Cu loading amount was 5 wt%, the highest photocatalytic evolution rate reached 16.09 mmol/g in 3 h which was 6.6 times of the C–ZnO-5 matrix and also about 9663 times higher than that of pure ZnO (16.65 μmol/g) in this study. But, no peak generated by Cu's LSPR was observed at about 600 nm because the content of Cu was too low in this study, and the similar result have even be reported [38]. The photocatalytic cyclic stability of Cu5/C–ZnO sample was shown in Fig. 6b, the H2 evolution rate could also reached to 13.68 mmol/g (Over 85%) in 3 h after 5 cycles, it showed that the material had the much better stability. It indicated that the Cu loading could greatly improve the hydrogen production performance of C–ZnO, and the Cu5/C–ZnO composite was an effective photocatalytic for H2 production with perfect stability. The photocatalytic hydrogen production property of this work was compared with a series of similar work, and the result was shown in Table 1 . The apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) of Cu5/C–ZnO at different wavelengths were then measured and showed in Supporting Information Fig. S3. The quantum efficiencies at 350, 500 and 650 nm wavelength of photocatalytic overall water splitting were 9.83%, 8.56% and 7.27%, respectively. The highest AQE reached 9.83% at 350 nm wavelength. Fig. 6c presented the UV–vis absorption spectra of the C–ZnO and Cux/C–ZnO samples. As a semiconductor, the relation between the band gap and UV–vis absorption could be determined by equation (2), and the respectively curve could be obtained as Fig. 6d. (2) α h ν = A ( h ν − E g ) n / 2 Where α, h, ν, A and Eg represent the absorption coefficient, planck constant, light frequency, constant and band gap, respectively. ZnO was a direct band gap semiconductor, the n value is 1 [42]. The band gap energy of C–ZnO sample could be calculated from a plot of (αhν)2 versus photon energy (hν), which was estimated to be about 2.87 eV in the prepared material. It suggested that the more efficient solar light utilization ratio was realized, which reached to the visible light region. Such, the absorption band edge of C–ZnO sample was broadened to 420 nm which could be attributed to the doping of C and the nanometer size effect. The absorption band edges of Cux/C–ZnO samples were wider than C–ZnO sample (As Fig. 6c) which could be attributed to loading of Cu on the surface of C–ZnO rather than in its crystal lattice [43]. Fig. 6e showed the Mott−Schottky plot of C–ZnO matrix, the positive slope of the plot indicated that the prepared C–ZnO was an n-type semiconductor, the flat band position of C–ZnO was obtained by extrapolation of Mott-Schottky plot which was about −0.69 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at pH = 7, and about −0.45 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The Mott Schottky plots and band gap of pure ZnO was given in Supporting Information Fig. S4, the result showed that C doping could obviously lead to the change of CB levels. For the n-type semiconductor, the conduction band (CB) was more negative about 0.1 V than the flat-band potential [44]. The CB of C–ZnO was about −0.55 V vs NHE. The position of VB could be calculated by the empirical equation Eg = Evb -Ecb, where Eg was the band gap of the C–ZnO, Evb was the VB potential, and Ecb was the CB potential. Correspondingly, the VB potential was about 2.32 eV. The band gap of the C–ZnO was obviously narrower than ZnO theoretical value (3.2 eV), it could be attributed to the generated defects in the ZnO crystal structure after the doping of C, which lifted up the VB of ZnO and pushed down the CB of ZnO to the lower energy level. Photo-electrochemical measurements were often employed to research the charge separation efficiency in the interface of the composites. The separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons and holes was one of the important factors to determine the photocatalytic performance. The Tafel polarization curves, transient photocurrent responses and electro-chemical impedance spectra (EIS) were used to study the charge separation efficiency in this work. Fig. 6f showed the transient photocurrent response curves of the catalysts in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. There was no obvious photocurrent in the dark, and the photocurrents of all samples were rapidly increased and remained basically constant when the light source was turned on. The EIS results were shown in Fig. 6g. The arc radius in the EIS spectra reflected the value of the resistance，the smaller radius reflected the lower of resistance for the charges transfer and the faster charges migration. Cu5/C–ZnO sample showed the smallest radius which should have the best photocatalytic performance. Fig. 6h showed the Tafel polarization curves which provided a clear and intuitive view to identify the value of the current density in the system. Comparing with the other samples, it was also noted that Cu5/C–ZnO sample showed the largest anodic Tafel slope. The larger anodic Tafel slope showed that Cu5/C–ZnO sample had the more reactivity, the much better catalytic performance and the much faster electron transfer. PL spectra could be used to reflect the generation, separation, and recombination properties of the photoexcited electron and holes in photocatalyst. Generally speaking, the visible PL emission can be ascribed to the intrinsic defects of the samples, such as zinc and oxygen vacancies, which could increase the light absorption，facilitate the carrier separation and carrier migration. As Fig. 6i, all PL spectra showed two broad emission peaks at 375–425 nm and 450–490 nm. The emission peak of the samples near 390 nm in the ultraviolet (UV) region was related to excitonic recombination, it was derived from the combination of electrons and hole which caused by zinc and oxygen vacancies defects [45,46]. The broad visible range emission peak at about 450–490 nm originated from the electron-hole recombination at a deep level which caused by oxygen vacancy defects [47]. According to this PL luminescence mechanism, the higher the electron-hole recombination rate will lead to the stronger the PL luminescence intensity, and the lower PL luminescence intensity proves that the sample has the higher electron-hole separation rate. From Fig. 6i, the PL emission intensity decreased significantly alone with the Cu content increase, the PL intensity was the lowest when the Cu content of was 5 wt%. It indicated that the Cu5/C–ZnO sample had the highest electron-hole separation efficiency, Cu co-catalysts could greatly facilitate the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes, and inhibit the recombination of the charge carriers, which was beneficial for the improvement of the photocatalytic performance. The photocurrent response of Cu5/C–ZnO sample was the strongest, which was consistent with PL analysis. According to the above experimental analysis, the significant increase of photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the fact that the doping of C can change the band gap of ZnO, while the loading of Cu can promote the separation efficiency of the photoexcited charge carriers on the surface of samples. As Scheme 2 , the electrons on ZnO VB cannot be excited by visible light which results the lower photocatalytic performance own to its wide band gap. On the contrary, the ZnO band gap can be narrowed by the doping of C and nanometer size effect which leads to a visible light response. The electrons on the VB of C–ZnO will migrate to CB under the visible light irradiation and are trapped by Cu cocatalyst, it leads to which the holes are leaved on the VB. Furthermore, the CB of the C–ZnO (−0.55V vs. NHE) is more negative than that of the H+/H2, the H+ can be photoexcited to form the H2 by photoelectron on the C–ZnO CB."
6,Conclusions,"In this study, the Cu decorated MOF-5 derived C–ZnO photocatalyst was synthesized through the calcination and photo-reduction method for the first time. Both the nanoscale structure and the doping of C could narrow the band gap of the ZnO to lead to a visible light response. Furthermore, the C doping also increased the electron density of Fermi level, which could effectively facilitate the charge separation. In particular, the loading of Cu cocatalyst could further accelerate the surface charge separation. It led to which Cu5/C–ZnO showed the most excellent photocatalytic H2 production performance under visible light."
