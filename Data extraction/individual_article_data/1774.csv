0,Introduction,"The recent dramatic increase in energy consumption resulted in severe environmental pollution and energy shortage, which necessitates a switch from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources such as wind-, solar-, ocean- and biomass-derived energy [1]. Compared to other renewable sources, biomass utilization showed many advantages due to abundant availability, ease storage and comfort transportation [2]. Currently, biomass provides approximately 14% of the world’s energy supply [3] and is in consistent with the concept of sustainable development [4]. Biodiesel is a form of liquid biofuels that can be produced from various feedstocks including vegetable oil, waste-cooking oil and animal fat through transesterification of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), generating glycerol as a byproduct [5]. The high potential of biodiesel utilization in the recent decade can be confirmed by its increasing annual global production. In 2014, the global biodiesel production increased by about 12-fold (30.1 billion liters) comparing to its production in 2004, with estimated annual waste glycerol (WG) production of 4.5 × 104 million ton [6]. In order to reduce the net energy requirements for biodiesel production and to compensate the cost difference between biodiesel and fossil diesel, conversion of WG into valuable compounds is a research hotspot [7]. Due to the high purification cost, unrefined WG is not preferred to be used by different industry sectors and, therefore, it has become a potential environmental pollutant [8,9]. The full utilization of WG using new innovative and cost-effective technologies is receiving increased attention. Conversion of WG from biodiesel-based industry into combustible oxygenated organics (e.g. alcohols and esters) through pyrolysis and/or co-pyrolysis might be an important approach. First generation biofuel feedstocks including crops and oil seeds [10] have ethical issues due to competition with animal feed and human food [11]. Alternatively, second generation feedstocks are produced from wastes and lignocellulosic agricultural residues. However, utilization of lignocelluloses for biofuel production is not economically viable at large scales due to the presence of lignin which requires a costly pretreatment [12]. Microalgae represent the main group of third-generation biofuel feedstocks with many advantages over other biofuel generations. Microalgae have short generation time, high photosynthetic rate, small footprint, high growth rate on wastewater without competing on the arable land, high CO2 sequestration efficiency, and high energy conversion [13,14]. In that regard, microalgal biomass showed much higher biofuel productivity than oil crops. Microalgal lipids can be extracted by solvents, and then converted into biodiesel through a transesterification reaction. However, biodiesel production from microalgae cannot utilize the non-lipid portion of the cell, and the process was reported as time consuming and costly with many environmental concerns. Consequently, thermochemical conversion by pyrolysis was suggested as the most efficient way for higher conversion rate of biomass due to conversion of the whole biomass in a single step [15]. Among pyrolysis products, the bio-oil is considered as the most valuable product as high energy-density biofuel [16,17]. Quantitatively, the bio-oil yield from pyrolysis of microalgae varies according to the microalgal species, harvest method, pyrolysis conditions and reactor type [18,19]. However, the bio-oil characteristics need to be upgraded in order to meet the standards required for transportation fuel and to be directly used in the existing engines with lower NOx emissions [20,21]. Currently, numerous upgrading methods have been applied to enhance the bio-oil characteristics, such as in-situ hydrogenation [22], hydrodeoxygenation [23,24], catalytic cracking of pyrolysis vapors [25], steam reforming [26], emulsification [27], esterification and extracting specific chemicals from the bio-oils [28]. For example, esterification and hydrogenation can be used to upgrade the bio-oil, but such processes are time consuming and costly with negative environmental impacts. The high cost is mainly attributed to the complexity of the operative production steps. In addition, preparation of esters or alcohols by chemical processing of the corresponding bio-oil component is often impractical due to prerequisite of many steps of initial preparation, bio-oil production, separation, conversion into the desired product and purification [29–31]. Maliutina et al. [32] enhanced the alcohol content in the bio-oil by pressurized pyrolysis (1 MPa) of microalgae at 600 °C. Results confirmed that the phytol 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol, with a relatively high concentration of 20.5%, was the major alcohol component in the bio-oil. However, it was accompanied by significant increase in nitrogen-containing compounds (NCCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols. In addition, the main disadvantage of such methods is the additional cost and energy consumption due to application of high pressure. Co-pyrolysis or catalytic pyrolysis could reduce the undesired carbonyl-compounds and produce or retain more high-value compounds, including alcohols and esters [33]. For instance, Yu et al. [34] used Pd/Al-SBA-15 as a catalyst to perform one-step hydrogenation–esterification of furfural and acetic acid. They reported that catalytic pyrolysis is the optimum selectivity to enhance the desired products (alcohols and esters) up to 66.4% with high conversion efficiency. In addition, Wei et al. [35] investigated the transformations of acids in the bio-oil to esters via ZSM-5 catalyst and confirmed the conversion of 89% of the acid to over 90% of esters using 2 wt% ZSM-5-catalytic pyrolysis. On the other hand, numerous studies evaluated the co-pyrolysis of biomass with different kinds of wastes in order to change the pyrolysis behavior and influencing the pyrolysis products in a cost-effective and eco-friendly way. Fang et al. [36] investigated the co-pyrolysis of paper mill sludge (PMS) with combustible solid waste (CSW) and found that 1:9 PMS:CSW ratio enhanced the alcohol content in the bio-oil, while adding 50% of PMS reduced the emission of gas pollutants. Peng et al. [37] studied the co-pyrolysis of textile dyeing sludge with microalgae and recorded that 80% blending ratio of microalgae resulted in lower average activation energy, higher co-pyrolysis effectiveness index and highest yield of the desired products. So far, co-pyrolysis of microalgae with WG and its impact on the bio-oil yield and composition were not previously studied. The unicellular green microalga Chlorella vulgaris is one of the typical microalgae with high growth rate, ability to grow in varied conditions, and produces promising pyrolysis products [38,39]. Therefore, the present study aimed to study the impact of different blending ratios of the industrial WG on the bio-oil yield and combustible oxygenated organics production through co-pyrolysis with C. vulgaris in a fixed bed reactor. After cultivation and harvest of C. vulgaris in a lab-scale photobioreactor, biomass and WG characterization and thermogravimetric analysis were performed. The produced crude bio-oil from pyrolysis experiment was further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography (GC–MS). Finally, preliminary recommendations for implementation of a proper ratio of WG to the microalgal biomass for enhanced compostable oxygenated organics were made."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microalgal growth and WG source,"2.1 Microalgal growth and WG source Chlorella vulgaris (SAG 211-11b, obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae, Göttingen University, Germany) was maintained in 300 mL of Flory medium [40] at 25 ± 1 °C and light intensity of 100 μmol photons m−2 s−1. C. vulgaris was scaled up into 4 L Flory medium in 5 L BoroKrzem Boro 3.3 glass bottle. At the middle of the exponential phase, the culture was transferred into lab-scale photobioreactor consisted of 20 vertical transparent polyethylene plastic bags (2 m length and 12.7 cm diameter) containing 16 L/each of Flory medium as described in our previous study [4] covering a land area of 2.0 m2. The initial optical density at 680 nm (OD680) was adjusted to 0.5 ± 0.07. Cultures were incubated at 25.0 ± 1.5 °C with average light intensity of 130 ± 12 μmol photons m−2 s−1 and 18:6h of light:dark cycle. Each column was bubbled continuously from the bottom using atmospheric air at aeration rate of 0.2 vvm. Growth was monitored every day by measuring the dry weight by filtration of 10 mL of the culture using 0.45 μm pore size filter paper followed by drying in oven at 80 °C until constant weight. Eq. (1) was used to calculate the cumulative biomass productivity (mg L−1 day−1), (1) B i o m a s s p r o d u c t i v i t y = ( DW t - DW 0 ) / t where DW0 and DWt represent the initial dry weight (g L−1) at the day of inoculation and that at time (t), respectively. At the time corresponding to the maximum cumulative biomass productivity, cultures were harvested by flocculation according to Vandamme et al. [41] using calcium hydroxide (pH 11), followed by centrifugation of the concentrated sludge at 3000×g for 10 min. After oven drying, the biomass was grinded, passed through a 100 µm aperture sieve, and kept in sealed plastic bags at ambient temperature for further use. WG was obtained from Cangzhou Xinsheng Recycling Resources Co., Ltd. (Hebei, China). The proximate and ultimate analysis of C. vulgaris and WG were measured as described in our previous study [15]."
3,Thermogravimetric analysis,"2.2 Thermogravimetric analysis Five different ratios of WG (0, 30%, 50%, 70% and 100%, w/w) were used in all experiments. In order to study the decomposition behavior, 10 ± 0.13 mg of the feedstock was placed in a quartz crucible of thermogravimetric simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA-449C, NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH, Germany). High purity nitrogen gas (>99.9 vol%) was used at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1. The temperature was increased up to 900 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. TG and DTG curves were drawn using OriginPro 8 SR0 (v8.0724, B724)."
4,(Co)-pyrolysis and product yields,"2.3 (Co)-pyrolysis and product yields Pyrolysis was performed in a fixed bed stainless reactor (11 cm height and 7.5 cm diameter) using nitrogen as a carrier gas (Fig. 1 ). In the present study, pyrolysis conditions were selected based on the previous study of Zainan et al. [38]. Initially, the furnace temperature was adjusted to 500 °C at a nitrogen flow rate of 800 mL min−1 to flush the reactor. When the temperature stabilized, the flow rate of nitrogen was reduced to 100 mL min−1 and the samples were fed into the reactor and pyrolyzed for 60 min. Pyrolysis product yields were calculated as previously explained by Wang et al. [15]."
5,Bio-oil characterization,"2.4 Bio-oil characterization 2.4.1 FTIR analysis The functional groups of the bio-oil were determined by FTIR (Nicolet Nexus 470 1.2). A drop of the bio-oil sample was pulverized with KBr at mass ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The infrared spectrum was studied at spectral range of 4000 cm−1–400 cm−1. The FTIR spectra were recorded by co-adding 32 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The obtained FTIR spectra were plotted using curve-fitting analysis in OriginPro 8. 2.4.2 GC–MS analysis Gas chromatography (GC, Agilent Technologies, 7890A) coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent Technologies, 5975C) equipped with a tripleaxis detector was used to determine the components of the bio-oil. The GC manufactured with HP-5MS column of 30 m length, 250 μm diameter and 0.25 μm thickness. High-purity helium at a flow rate of 3 mL min−1 was used as a carrier gas. The injector and detector temperatures were adjusted at 300 °C. The oven heating procedures started at initial temperature of 40 °C and increased to 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, then upheld at 300 °C for 5 min. The higher heating values (HHV) of the bio-oil and alcohol were calculated according to Saber et al. [42] and Pourkarimi et al. [43] using the following equation; (2) H H V MJ kg = 0.338 C + 1.428 H - O 8 + 0.095 S"
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis Three replicates were used in all experiments and results were represented as the mean ± standard deviation. The statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by least significant difference (LSD) test, was performed using SPSS (IBM, v.20) at a probability level (P) ≤ 0.05."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Microalgal growth and feedstock characteristics,"3.1 Microalgal growth and feedstock characteristics Fig. 2 shows the growth curve of C. vulgaris cultivated in polyethylene plastic bags for 17 days. Day 13 showed the highest significant dry weight of 2.00 g L−1 which showed insignificant differences by further incubation. However, the highest cumulative biomass productivity of 0.170 g L−1 day−1 was recorded at the 7th day, which showed insignificant changes up to the 9th day. Therefore, cultures were harvested at the 9th day of incubation for further experiments. From the proximate analysis (Table 1 ), WG showed significant higher volatiles and moisture contents (27.5% and 19.3%, respectively, higher than C. vulgaris). In addition, C. vulgaris showed 14.6% and 6.5% ash content and fixed carbon, respectively, which were not recorded in WG. However, no significant differences were detected in the carbon and hydrogen contents of both feedstocks, while nitrogen and sulfur contents of WG showed 37.6% and 69.7%, respectively, lower than C. vulgaris (Table 1)."
9,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis Fig. 3 shows the mass loss (TG) and derivative mass loss (DTG) of C. vulgaris blended with different ratios of WG. Results of TG showed that the decomposition of C. vulgaris was completed in three main stages (Fig. 3a). The first stage is a preheating stage (below 215.1 °C, with mass loss of 5.6%) due to the partial evaporation of moisture and small molecular volatiles. The second stage (from 215.1 °C to 567.0 °C) showed the main mass loss (68.75%) with the main peak at 341.8 °C (mass loss rate of −7.5%/min, Fig. 3a). The mass loss in the second stage is mainly attributed to the decomposition of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids of C. vulgaris [44,45]. In the third stage, a slow secondary thermal decomposition took place forming the tailing mass loss (3.6%) in a temperature range of 567.0–784.9 °C. TG of C. vulgaris showed relatively high solid matter (22.0%), which might be attributed to the high fixed carbon and ash content as shown in the proximate analysis. In addition, many inorganic compounds such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are required for microalgal growth which provides complex constituents in the biomass leading to the long-span pyrolysis temperature range [45,46]. In that context, proteins and lipids from two microalgae, Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4 and Chlorella sorokiniana CY1, showed degradation temperature ranges of 227–387 °C and 287–467 °C, respectively [47]. In addition, Wu et al. [48] confirmed 266 °C, 291 °C, and 348 °C as the maximum degradation peaks of glycine, starch, and medium chain triglycerides as model components of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, respectively. Therefore, the complex composition of C. vulgaris resulted in complicated pyrolysis process and overlapping of the corresponding different peaks which expanded the pyrolysis temperature range up to 567 °C. On the other hand, thermal decomposition of WG was completed in four stages (Fig. 3e), starting with the preheating stage up to 183.2 °C with mass loss of 6.9%. The second stage was a volatilization stage (183.2–231.4 °C) where some of volatile compounds released with a mass loss of 15.0%. This stage was followed by another severe decomposition stage (231.4–415.3 °C) with mass loss of 61.3%. Thus, the main decomposition stage of WG included two sub-stages which can be confirmed from the two peaks detected in the DTG curve. The final stage (415.3–804.6 °C) showed slight mass loss of 5.8% due to the decomposition of carbonaceous constituents in the solid residue. The final solid residue of WG was 11.0%, which is 50.0% lower than that of C. vulgaris. The interactions of WG with C. vulgaris (Fig. 3b–d) showed similar mass loss trends, where TG and DTG curves of the mixtures were distributed between those of sole C. vulgaris and WG. Using 30% WG showed a broad peak of mass loss during the second stage of decomposition (Fig. 3b), which is similar to that of C. vulgaris. However, increasing of WG to 50% and 70% in the blend showed two main peaks of mass loss (Fig. 3c and d), which is similar to that of pure WG. In addition, increasing of WG in the blend to 30%, 50% and 70% resulted in reduction of final solid residue to 16.2%, 4.5% and 5.0%, respectively. WG is organic compound which incline to volatilization and degradation easily [45], thus increasing of its proportion increased the DTG peak strength (Fig. 3b–e). Overall, the increase of C. vulgaris blend ratio resulted in higher solid residues, while increase of WG proportion enhanced the thermal decomposition rate at early stages of the process with lower solid residues, showing its minimum value at 50% WG. These results confirmed that C. vulgaris and WG have complementary advantages during co-pyrolysis which resulted in higher energy conversion potential."
10,Impact of WG on product distribution,"3.3 Impact of WG on product distribution The effect of different ratios of WG on pyrolysis product yields of C. vulgaris was further studied (Fig. 4 ). Pyrolysis of C. vulgaris individually resulted in bio-oil yield of 56.9%, which increased significantly up to 73.7% due to individual pyrolysis of WG. Co-feeding of 50% and 70% WG increased the bio-oil yield by 2.8% and 14.6%, respectively, over C. vulgaris alone. In addition, pyrolytic gas yield increased significantly by increasing of WG blend ratio. Both bio-oil and pyrolytic gas yields increased in favor of bio-char, which reduced significantly from 24.0% in C. vulgaris to 17.4% at 50% WG blend ratio (Fig. 4). In that context, Fantozzi et al. [49] reported that acetol and 3-hydroxypropanal are very reactive intermediates during glycerol pyrolysis which eventually tend to form syngas. In addition, Manara and Zabaniotou [50] confirmed that the increase of WG ratio in the blend with lignite enhanced the bio-oil yield which was attributed to the high volatile content of WG. They also recorded a significant reduction in the bio-char yield by increasing of glycerol ratio, which was attributed to the partial gasification of the carbonaceous residues (char) resulting in higher gas yield, which agrees with the present results. Recently, Fantozzi et al. [49] investigated the pyrolysis behavior of pure glycerol and found that the production of solid fraction was negligible, and the mass balance was almost closed by the volatiles. This finding can be confirmed in the present study by the results of proximate and TG analysis where WG showed higher volatiles and not detectable ash content as previously discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2."
11,Bio-oil characteristics,"3.4 Bio-oil characteristics 3.4.1 FTIR analysis The structural changes and component decomposition of biomass can be investigated by FTIR which records the changes in the main functional groups [51]. Fig. 5 shows the functional group profiles of the five studied samples of C. vulgaris, WG and their blends. The absorption intensity of the bio-oil from pure WG showed stronger stretching vibration from 3600 cm−1 to 3040 cm−1, which is attributed to O–H stretching. It is ascribed to macromolecules decomposition into smaller compounds, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, and phenols [52–54]. The dehydrogenation of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates forms amino acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons rich in C–H groups. In addition, pyrolysis of lipids from microalgae (mainly triglyceride) produced alkenes and alkanes which are rich in C–H group as well. The presence of C–H groups is represented by stretching vibration at 2940 cm−1. However, WG showed stronger peak than C. vulgaris, which might be attributed to the significant increase in the content of alcohols and esters in the bio-oil of WG. The peaks at 2357 cm−1 are assigned to CO functional groups [45]. WG bio-oil showed stronger CO2 peak, while it was much weaker in case of C. vulgaris. This confirms the high carboxylic acid content in WG bio-oil, which reduced by blending with C. vulgaris. In addition, WG showed stronger vibration amplitude at 1460 cm−1 and 1079 cm−1, which may be identified as asymmetric deformation vibration and C–H and C–N stretching vibration, respectively [55,56], which indicates the high content of ketones and aldehydes in the bio-oil. The absorption peak at 730 cm−1 appeared only in C. vulgaris-containing samples, which is associated with C–O stretching vibrations [57]. The evolved C–O peak was mainly attributed to the depolymerization of lipids and carbohydrates found in the biomass [36,45]. The abovementioned results confirmed a synergistic effect of WG and C. vulgaris during pyrolysis which resulted in significant impact on the bio-oil characteristics and composition as discussed in the following section. 3.4.2 Bio-oil composition Bio-oil is a complex mixture containing hundreds of organic compounds. Typically, bio-oils are highly acidic, mainly due to the presence of carboxylic acids, which results in severe problems of engines corrosion. In addition, the high content of NCCs in the bio-oil raised many environmental concerns due to NOx emissions. For these reasons, upgrading of bio-oils and/or enhancement of certain valuable compounds is a great challenge in order to be considered as a real alternative to fossil fuels. The detailed GC–MS spectra of the bio-oils produced from different blends are shown in the Supplementary data (Fig. S1 and Table S1). In general, a total of 114 compounds were detected in the different studied samples, that can be classified into main eight fractional groups namely, alcohols, esters, NCCs, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, phenols, ethers, and ketoaldehydes (Table 2 ). Results showed that the content of alcohols and esters increased sharply from 1.4% and 0.0% in the bio-oil of C. vulgaris to 52.2% and 28.7%, respectively, in the bio-oil of WG. However, 50% WG blend ratio showed the maximum alcohol content of 72.3%. This heterogenous increase in the compounds confirms the synergistic effect of WG which has inconsistent impact at different proportions. On the other hand, the content of NCCs in the bio-oil decreased from 63.4% in C. vulgaris to 6.3% in WG. However, using 50% blend of WG reduced the NCCs by 82.2% below C. vulgaris, while acids were completely disappeared. In addition, the content of phenols reduced gradually (from 11.5% in C. vulgaris) by increasing the WG proportion, reaching zero value in the bio-oil from sole WG. Moreover, ketoaldehyde proportion increase by increasing of WG blend ratio, which might be explained by the findings of Fantozzi et al. [44] who confirmed that pyrolysis of glycerol results in very reactive intermediates which rapidly decompose to form the most stable species, such as acetaldehyde and acrolein. In agreement with the present results, Yang et al. [58] and Zhang et al. [59] used a low temperature approach to upgrade the bio-oils through thermal decomposition with olefins over solid acid catalysts. Results confirmed simultaneous acid-catalyzed reactions of phenolic compounds, carboxylic acids, and water to form higher fuel value products, mainly esters or alcohols. On the other hand, hydrocarbons reduced sharply by increasing the WG proportion. The recorded reductions might be attributed to the activation of esterification and oxygenation reactions of hydrocarbons and acids to form esters and alcohol [29]. Although HHV of bio-oil showed reduction by increasing of WG blend ratio, the HVV of the produced alcohols, as the main target of the present study, showed its highest value of ≈23 MJ kg−1 at 50% and 70% WG which represented about 43 times higher than that of pure C. vulgaris (Table 2). Fig. 6 shows the suggested pathways for the reaction of C. vulgaris and WG intermediates. Pyrolysis of carbohydrates, such as glucose, might undergoes decarboxylation, decarbonylation and dehydration releasing H2O, CO2 and H2 which interact with hydrocarbons, and generate CO, CH4, C2H4 and other gases. Proteins are decomposed forming many NCCs and NH3. In addition, pyrolysis of pyrroles produced from glucose might results in NCCs. Due to the high content of carbohydrates and proteins in microalgae, pyrolysis of pure C. vulgaris resulted in relatively high concentrations of NCCs and hydrocarbons, while WG reduces their formation. On the other hand, glycerol might be decomposed at high temperature to form ethylene glycol, which dehydrated further to form alcohols. In addition, some amino acids, such as leucine, might undergo C–C cleavage and interact with CO2 and H2O to form isoputanol which can be converted further to esters. In addition, decomposition of glycerol might result in formation of organic acids. Therefore, WG enhanced the formation of alcohols, esters and acids. Overall, the total sum of esters and alcohols could reach the maximum value of 80.2% in the bio-oil at 50% blend ratio of WG. Thus, alcohols and esters were the main products in the bio-oil of 50% WG-blended samples."
12,Technical feasibility,"3.5 Technical feasibility Based on biomass production, bio-oil parameters, land area used in the present study and the culture volume, it is possible to estimate the large-scale production of alcohols and esters from pyrolysis of 1 ton of feedstock (Table 3 ). In addition, biomass and the land area required to grow C. vulgaris were estimated. Using the present cultivation system (320 L culture in a land area of 2.0 m2), the estimated total areal biomass productivity was 219.3 ton ha−1 y−1. Direct pyrolysis of 1 ton of C. vulgaris would produce 569.1 kg of bio-oil, which is about 10 times higher than biodiesel production from Scenedesmus obliquus using the same cultivation system [4]. This finding confirms that thermochemical conversion is most efficient route for higher conversion rate of microalgal biomass due to conversion of the whole biomass. Blending glycerol by 30%, 50%, and 70% with C. vulgaris enhanced the bio-oil yield to 571.8, 585.0 and 652.3 kg, which reached its maximum value of 736.6 kg using pure WG. A maximum alcohol production of 717.6 kg was estimated at 50% WG blend ratio, with 84.3 kg of esters. Direct pyrolysis of WG showed 53.1% conversion efficiency into alcohol, while 50% blending with C. vulgaris showed 71.8% conversion efficiency into alcohol. In addition to enhancement of alcohol and esters by WG blending with microalgae, this technique would reduce the land area required for biomass production by 50%. Therefore, the present study suggested a simple and practical approach for one-step alcohol and esters production."
13,Conclusion,"In the present study, an innovative approach for conversion of microalgae into alcohols and esters was proposed. WG enhanced the production of liquids and gases in favor of bio-char. Using 50% of WG in the blend enhanced the alcohols content in the bio-oil by 50 times and 38% over the individual pyrolysis of C. vulgaris and WG, respectively. In addition, 50% WG enhanced esters formation by 8 times over C. vulgaris, with reduction of NCCs by 82.2%. Recycling of WG for alcohols and esters production not only helps to save resources, but also solves the high cost of WG processing. This makes WG blending with microalgal biomass to be efficient route for alcohols and esters production that has a potential to recycle the WG from biodiesel industry. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of WG on pyrolytic gas and alcohol composition and characteristics. In addition, optimization of co-pyrolysis conditions is of great importance to further enhance the alcohols and esters yield."
