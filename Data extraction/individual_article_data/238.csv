0,Introduction,"The UK’s transport sector consumed 57 Mtoe of energy over a year which is 40% of total energy consumption [1]. Road transport was responsible for approximately 70% of the total consumption by transport sector [1,2] of which two-thirds is consumed by passenger vehicles [2]. ICEs (internal combustion engine) dominate the passenger car market with petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles accounting for 58.5% and 39.1% of total registered vehicles in the UK [3] and it is expected to be the case beyond 2030 where the sales of the ICE only vehicles will halt. Due to global warming, fossil fuels usage and CO2 emissions are targeted. From 2021, the CO2 fleet average target of 95 g/km must be met by vehicle manufacturers which is a reduction of 20% from 2017 target and 60% from the 2007 target. Many new technologies are being utilised for gasoline engines such as variable cam timing, direct injection, turbocharging to make the modern engines more efficient. Turbocharged engines offer high power density. However, due to this at high loads exhaust gas temperature can increase, this can constitute to loss of thermal efficiency and rise of NOX emissions. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is widely adopted in modern GDI engines to reduce NOx emissions [4]. The presence of N2 in the EGR also dilutes the charge. This serves as a de-throttling effect and contributes in increasing thermal efficiency by reducing the pumping losses [5]. However, at higher dilution rates combustion can become unstable. Hydrogen-enriched-EGR can stabilise combustion under such dilution settings. Alger et al. reported addition of 0.2% hydrogen in EGR can reduce COV (coefficient of variation) of IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) by 6% [5]. Hydrogen is seen as a carbon-free alternative to replace fossil fuels in modern gasoline direct injection engines. Hydrogen has high combustion energy, high flame propagation rate (comparison to gasoline), low ignition energy and low lean-flammability limits. Therefore, if introduced with gasoline in combustion chamber it not merely stabilises combustion under challenging operation conditions i.e. cold-start, low-load, lean-combustion, but also increases engine’s thermal efficiency and thus, reduction in fuel consumption. One-third of the energy provided to an ICE is wasted in the form of exhaust heat [6]. If part of this wasted heat is recovered from the exhaust gas, it can be used to increase engine’s thermal efficiency. One way of doing that is with simultaneous on-board production of hydrogen via thermo-chemical recuperation. The resulted H2-rich reformate from the reforming process is then fed back to the engine. This increases thermal efficiency of the engine due to i) increase in flame speed which makes the combustion cycle closer to an ideal otto cycle and ii) higher energy content of the reformate in comparison to the energy of the fuel used in the reforming process and also iii) due to the de-throttling effect as in the case of EGR [7–10]. Ji et al. reported 3% increase in thermal efficiency with 3% hydrogen addition [11]. Moreover, potential benefits of hydrogen rich reformate combustion in pollutant emissions reduction (e.g. CO, NOx, particulate matter) have also been reported. With reformate introduction into the engine, unburnt fuel near the combustion chamber walls decreases due to low flame quenching distance of hydrogen in comparison to gasoline, this leads to reductions in engine out CO emissions [12], despite the CO introduction within the reformate stream. Reductions in NOx in comparison to baseline engine operation have been also reported. CO content in reformate increases heat capacity of the charge in the combustion chamber which reduces in-cylinder temperature and hence reduction in NOx [13]. N2 (inert gas) in reformate also increases dilution which helps in lowering the in-cylinder temperature further which translates to further NOx reduction [12,14]. Significant reductions in PM (particulate matter) mass and number have also been reported [13]. Bogarra et al. examined particulate emissions for REGR combustion. Reductions along the whole particle size distribution were reported even for very small particles (10–50 nm) [12]. Although the PM mass and PM number reductions were reported, no changes to primary particle nanostructure were reported [15]. No detrimental effect on TWC operation was reported with reformate combustion [12,13,15]. Exhaust gas fuel reforming emphasis is now shifting to renewable fuels, bio-alcohols being emerged as potential candidates to replace gasoline from combustion engines and provide additional CO2 benefits. Hydrogen reforming of such biofuels can also provide further reduction in carbon emissions due to their carbon neutrality (carbon emissions from Well-to-Wheel) [16]. Methanol and ethanol have been extensively studied as reforming fuels for on-board hydrogen production [17–20]. Poran et al. reported a study on thermo-chemical recuperation of the waste heat recovery with methanol steam reforming in transient time dependent model [18]. Sall et al. reported a study of exhaust reforming with ethanol under relatively low temperatures (350 °C to 450 °C) [21]. Both studies reported benefits of the exhaust gas reforming in terms of combustion efficiency and improvements in engine thermal efficiency. Recovered waste heat can be measured as exergy change across a reformer. Recovered exhaust energy would vary with i) altering engine operation conditions due to change in exhaust gas temperature and mass flow (available exergy) and ii) with altering reforming process parameters i.e. fuel amount, reactants’ feed rates. The reforming process parameters define overall endothermic or exothermic nature of the process. Exergy-change reduces when exothermic reactions dominate the reforming process as these reactions cause fuel penalty [22,23]. Published literature on modelling of on-board fuel reforming lacks in considering the limited exergy availability in the engine exhaust and a strategy to maximise the exergy change [23–27]. Moreover, the on-board reformer studies in literature have been conducted on a few steady-state engine operation conditions and none on a vehicle test cycle [17–21]. To maximise heat recovery process, it is vital that operation of an on-board reformer is carried out when endothermic reactions such as steam reforming and dry reforming are favourable and dominating. With increase of alcohol fuel chain length, endothermicity of the reforming process increases, however the exergy available in the exhaust gas is limited. Therefore, optimised operation of an on-board reformer is desired. The objective of the study presented herein are: i) comprehensive examination of the effects of C1-C5 bio-alcohols against iso-octane on a thermochemical waste heat recovery system for more efficient and cleaner modern GDI engines at any given available exergy in the exhaust gas. ii) Detailed thermodynamic analysis of the reactor using species yields trends and Gibbs free energy to chemically differentiate the fuels. iii) To couple engine/vehicle simulation and thermodynamic reactor results to analyse waste heat recovery system’s performance at a range of steady state engine operation conditions (IMEP: 0.4–8.8 bar; engine speed 1000–3000 rpm) and over WLTC (worldwide harmonised light duty vehicle test cycle) for all the examined fuels. The study presents the combined capabilities of bio-alcohols and on-board hydrogen reforming for exhaust waste heat recovery to reduce total vehicle fuel consumption and thus tailpipe CO2 emissions for ultra-low emissions vehicles, efficient hybrid powertrains and range extender applications."
1,Methodology,
2,Fuels,"2.1 Fuels In this study, methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol and iso-pentanol are examined for on-board heat recovery via fuel reforming with iso-octane as a reference fuel. The properties of the fuels are displayed in Table 1 . Table 2 shows properties of gasoline used for the vehicle model."
3,Models integration,"2.2 Models integration A thermodynamic reactor model was created to obtain product yields for varying inlet temperature and reforming fuel amount. Simultaneously, an engine and a vehicle model were created in AVL CRUISE M to estimate exhaust mass flow and exhaust temperature for varying engine operation conditions. Results from the thermodynamic reactor model were fed into a Simulink model to generate lookup tables. For example, to compute hydrogen yield, temperature vs fuel amount vs H2(vol%) 3-D lookup-up tables were generated. Look-up tables were used to calculate available exergy, reforming efficiency, hydrogen efficiency and heat recovered. Fig. 1 presents a graphical illustration of the methodology."
4,Thermodynamic reactor model,"2.3 Thermodynamic reactor model To conduct thermodynamic study, Ansys Chemkin 18.2 package was utilised. Within Chemkin, equilibrium reactor was chosen as it exploits Gibbs free energy minimisation method to identify possible products from given reactor-inlet mixture composition under given inlet temperature and pressure conditions. The analysis was conducted for engine’s exhaust composition under stoichiometric conditions. The exhaust composition utilised in this study is shown in Table 3 . The reactor simulations were facilitated by detailed reaction mechanisms reported by Tsujimura et al. [34] and Sarathy et al. [35]. A series of zero-dimensional simulations were performed for inlet stream temperatures ranging from 350 °C to 950 °C with increments of 25 °C. The reformer inlet stream composition was varied for each simulation by changing the reforming fuel amount. The reforming fuel amount was varied according to the steam to carbon ratio (S/C: Eq. (1)) or oxygen to carbon ratio (O2/C: Eq. (2)), whereas, the engine-out exhaust composition was assumed to be constant (Table 3). S/C and O2/C for each fuel was varied between 0.5 and 4.0 and 0.3–2.5, respectively. The range of S/C is chosen because at higher S/C, the hydrogen yields are minute and at lower S/C coke formation is significant [36]. Pressure was maintained at 1 atm.

5,Vehicle model,"2.4 Vehicle model 2.4.1 Engine model A model was developed for a GDI 2.0L 4-cylinder turbocharged engine using AVL Cruise M. The model was validated experimentally (see Fig. A2, Fig. A3, Fig. A4). Full specifications of the engine are given in Table 4 . K-type thermocouples were installed at different positions in the intake and exhaust gas paths to measure the temperatures. Temperatures were recorded using PICO data logger. In cylinder pressure trace from the real engine were used to calculate ROHR (rate of heat release). The computed normalised ROHR curve and valve timing were inserted into model to capture combustion characteristics of the real engine (see Fig. 2 ). Temperature profiles from real engine were used to define characteristic maps for intercooler heat transfer and exhaust manifold heat transfer. FMEP (friction mean effective pressure) map was defined to account for parasitic losses. K03 turbocharger was modelled using the available K03 compressor and turbine maps. The developed engine model is shown in Fig. 3 . The engine temperature and fuel consumption profiles were validated with engine operated from cold start to 60Nm@2100RPM and then transitioned to 90Nm@2100RPM and back to 60Nm@2100RPM (see Fig. A3). The IMEP of the engine was validated at three engine operation conditions 30Nm@2100RPM, 60Nm@2100RPM and 105Nm@2100RPM. Experimental IMEP values under aforementioned operation conditions were observed to be 3, 4.8 and 7.2 bar, respectively. The model predicted IMEP values with 96% accuracy (see Fig. A2). The developed engine model was run at various IMEP conditions ranging from 0.4 to 8.8 bar with 0.4 bar increments and engine speed was varied between 1000 and 3000 RPM with increments of 200 RPM for each IMEP to obtain exhaust gas temperature and exhaust flow rate maps. The engine model was further integrated with driveline model to obtain temperature and flow rate profiles over WLTC. 2.4.2 Driveline model To accurately define characteristics of the components from engine to wheels, vehicle data such as curb mass, gross vehicle mass, overall length, wheelbase, width, brake discs dimensions, transmission gear ratios and final drive ratio were defined [37] and are shown in Table 5 . Vehicle drag coefficient was approximated to be 0.3 and projected frontal area was computed to be 2.28 m2. Total resistance force function of the vehicle was modelled using the Eq. (3), where C1(N) = 200, C2(N.(m/s)-1) = 2.6388 and C3(N.(m/s)-2) = 0.373896 are road load coefficients and V (m/s) is speed of the vehicle [38]. Driveline model is shown in Fig. 4 . (3) F = C 1 + C 2 × V + C 3 × V 2 WLTC vehicle duty cycle was used to benchmark the performance of different reforming fuels. Performance characteristics of the vehicle were used to obtain bespoke gear change profile based on the algorithm developed by UNECE [39]. The gear and speed profiles over the duration of the duty cycle are shown in Fig. 5 . Vehicle model was operated according to the duty cycle to obtain exhaust gas temperature and exhaust gas mass flow profiles."
6,Simulink model for heat recovery computation,"2.5 Simulink model for heat recovery computation To compute recovered heat, a Simulink model was utilised to analyse exergy and optimise the reactors operational parameters. Species mass fractions of H2, CO2, CO, H2O, CH4 and NH3, equilibrium temperature, equilibrium specific volume obtained from thermodynamic reactor results were fed into the model as a function of S/C and reactor inlet temperature in the form of 3-D lookup tables. The Simulink model’s execution logic is illustrated in Fig. 6 . 1-D lookup tables for exhaust temperature and exhaust mass flow as a function of time obtained from engine simulations results were imported into the Simulink model for each candidate reforming fuel. The lookup tables defined inlet conditions to the reformer and exergy availability. Exergy defines the extractable energy from an object with respect to its surrounding temperature. Exhaust temperature defined instantaneous reactor temperature. Definition of exergy change is shown in Equation (4), where H, S and To stands for enthalpy, entropy and standard room temperature (298 K) respectively. REGR rate defined feed rate of reactants into the reformer i.e. 10% REGR rate implies, one-tenth of exhaust is used as reactant for the reforming process. Exhaust gas flow and REGR rate defined number of moles at the reformer inlet. Each model execution returned optimal S/C values for each time-step of the vehicle duty cycle by maximising reforming efficiency and heat recovered from exhaust’s total exergy. Weighted sum of the two objectives to be maximised was utilised for optimal S/C evaluation. Consequently, recovered heat was computed from the LHV (lower heating value) gain resulted from the reforming process. To compute engine’s heat recovery map against IMEP and engine speed, the Simulink model was executed with exhaust temperature and mass flow values from engine model’s operation under several IMEP and RPM conditions.

7,Results and discussion,
8,Thermodynamic reactor analysis,"3.1 Thermodynamic reactor analysis Thermodynamic reactor simulations were carried out for each fuel. The resultant product yields were analysed for overall reforming process efficiency. Reforming efficiency (ηref) is the ratio of energy content at the reactor’s outlet and the energy content at the reactor’s inlet (Equation (5)). The reforming efficiency greater than 100% represents heat recovered from exhaust. Whereas, reforming efficiency less than 100% implies loss in some of the energy content of the reforming fuel. Reforming efficiency maps for each fuel were generated for the entire S/C and temperature range considered for this study (Fig. 7 ). From the reforming efficiency maps, it is evident that for all fuels reforming efficiency is maximum at temperature in excess of 800 °C. For higher temperatures, the highest reforming efficiency is available at lower S/Cs. This means that with rising temperatures endothermic reforming reactions obtain required energy from the exhaust heat [23] instead of oxidative-exothermic side reactions which cause fuel penalty. (5) η ref = LHV o f t h e r e f o r m a t e a t t h e r e f o r m e r o u t l e t LHV o f t h e i n j e c t e d f u e l a m o u n t × 100 With increase in temperature, H2 selectivity increases in comparison to CH4 this also contributed to increase in reforming efficiency. With increase in fuel chain length, the maximum reforming efficiency increases due to lower oxygen content and higher hydrogen content. Iso-propanol and iso-pentanol showed highest reforming efficiency of 120% and 118% respectively (similar to iso-octane), while methanol showed the lowest reforming efficiency of 114%. For constant inlet temperature, the reforming efficiency initially increases with rise in S/C and then starts to decrease at higher S/Cs. This trend can be explained by increasing H2 selectivity and decreasing CH4 selectivity with increase of S/C as shown in Fig. 8 . Moreover, with rising S/C, O2/C increases which gives rise to oxidising reactions to support endothermic reforming reactions. However, with high O2/C the oxidative reactions consume most of the fuels instead of endothermic reactions, this leads to a dip in hydrogen yield and hence lower reforming efficiency [40]. Park et al. reported a dip of 40% in hydrogen yield when O2/C was increased from 0.25 to 0.50 for POX of ethanol [40]. At 500 °C all the fuels except methanol showed increasing trend of hydrogen selectivity with increasing S/C followed by a steady decrease. Different trend of hydrogen selectivity of methanol is due to absence of C–C bond and hence lower energy required for its decomposition to CO and H2 [41]. Methanation selectivity decreases at higher temperatures due to its exothermic nature. Moreover, CO/CO2 decomposition is not thermodynamically feasible at higher temperatures due to its reversible nature [42]. From above it can be seen that the trends of H2 selectivity are comparable to reforming efficiency trends. Therefore, the results obtained from the thermodynamic reactor were further analysed to map hydrogen efficiency against S/C and inlet temperature for all the fuels. Hydrogen efficiency (ηH2) is defined as the ratio of energy content of hydrogen in the reformate and energy content of the injected fuel amount (Equation (6)). The generated hydrogen efficiency maps are shown in Fig. 9 . The shortest chain alcohol exhibits marginally highest hydrogen efficiency for studied temperature range under all S/C conditions i.e. 35% to 65% for methanol compared to 20% to 60% for ethanol and 15% to 55% for iso-pentanol. As the fuel chain length gets longer, the highest hydrogen efficiency is only available at higher S/C conditions. This is because with rising S/C, consequent increase of O2/C would result in increase in oxidative reactions. The exothermic nature of oxidative reactions would facilitate in breaking C–C bonds of C-2 or higher chain fuels for hydrogen production. (6) η H 2 = LHV o f H 2 c o n t e n t a t t h e r e f o r m e r o u t l e t LHV o f t h e i n j e c t e d f u e l a m o u n t a t t h e r e f o r m e r i n l e t × 100 For an application of exhaust heat recovery, higher S/Cs could limit the amount of exhaust waste-heat being extracted because the heat being utilised for endothermic reforming reactions is supplied by the exothermic oxidation reactions. To understand different hydrogen yields at different temperatures for each fuel, product species composition analysis is conducted to establish prominence of major reforming reactions i.e. methanation, steam reforming, dry reforming, WGS an RWGS (Table A1) under various reactor temperature conditions. The species composition analysis is conducted at S/C = 2 to ensure the hydrogen yield “knee-point” for each fuel lie in the feasible temperature range (350 °C to 950 °C). Fig. 10 shows H2 production with respect to H2O (a), CO (b), CO2 (c) and CH4 (d), respectively. Steam reforming (SR) consumes water and reforming fuel to form H2 and CO. Water gas shift (WGS) reaction turns carbon monoxide and water into H2 and CO2. Whereas reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction operates in the opposite direction to WGS. Dry reforming (DR) reaction consumes CO2 and reforming fuel to produce H2 and CO. At lower temperatures, methanation reaction is also very significant as it consumes H2 and CO or CO2 to form methane and water. Methanation reaction is exothermic in nature hence undesirable for heat-recovery purposes moreover it consumes H2 to form CH4 which results in reformate having less laminar flame speed (Table 1). To understand thermodynamic feasibility and prominence, Gibbs free energies of the major reforming reactions (Table A1) were computed over the examined temperature range. Fig. 11 showing comparison of the free energies for all the candidate fuels. Gibbs free energy is computed by taking the difference of standard enthalpy change and product of temperature and standard entropy change as shown in the Equation (7). (7) Δ G i b b s f r e e e n e r g y = Δ e n t h a l p y - T e m p e r a t u r e × Δ ( e n t r o p y ) From Fig. 9 it is evident that, hydrogen yield does not reach maximum for any of the fuels at temperatures between 350 °C and 450 °C. Fig. 10 (a) shows increase in H2/H2O ratio in this temperature range. This trend indicates consumption of water and formation of H2. Similarly, formation of CO can be deduced from Fig. 10 (b). From Fig. 10 (a), a sharp increasing trend of H2/H2O (mol/mol) indicates prominence of partial oxidation, direct decomposition and water gas shift reaction in the temperature range. A decreasing trend of H2/CO (mol/mol) can be observed in Fig. 10 (b). This indicates rapid increase in formation of CO as the temperature increases. This trend agrees with different studies reported in literature [14,43,44]. Fig. 10 (d) also suggest a significant formation of CH4 which reduces as the temperature increases, indicative of methanation reactions [43,44,45]. Therefore, most of the hydrogen production in the lower temperature range is resultant from partial oxidation and direct decomposition of the fuel [45] and water gas shift reaction [41]. As the temperature increases, highly endothermic reforming reactions such as steam reforming and dry reforming become more dominant. Increasing steam reforming prominence is indicated by sharp rise of H2/H2O curve (Fig. 10 (a)). At ~500 °C methanol exhibits highest hydrogen yield as indicated by hydrogen efficiency graph (Fig. 9 (a)), which is further supported by “knee point” observed in H2/H2O and H2/CO2 curves for methanol. Methanol having no C–C bonds benefits from low endothermicity of steam reforming reaction (Fig. 11 (a)) and hence steam reforming for methanol peaks quicker with increase in temperature compared to other fuels. Ethanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, iso-pentanol also reach maximum hydrogen yields respectively at temperatures between 500 °C and 600 °C. Vizcaíno et al. reported ethanol steam reforming over Cu-Ni supported catalysts for S/C2H5OH = 3.7 (S/C = 1.85) [43]. The study showed hydrogen selectivity flattening beyond 600 °C. Methane selectivity was ever decreasing with rise in temperature. The trend of hydrogen yield for n-butanol reported here is similar to a study reported by Hartley et al. [44]. The author studied products species for S/C = 2 and O2/C = 1.2 for four temperatures at 300 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C and 900 °C. The study showed maximum hydrogen production at 700 °C with negligible methane yields beyond 500 °C [44]. As the fuel chain length increases, the “knee point” for hydrogen yield lies further on the temperature axis which is due to increase of energy required for endothermic reforming reactions. At temperatures beyond 600 °C methanol hydrogen yield starts to drop steadily which is due to the onset of reverse water gas shift reaction. Fig. 11 (a) & (b) show that beyond 650 °C the dry reforming reactions are thermodynamically more favourable in comparison to steam reforming for C2-C5 alcohols and iso-octane which is evident from relatively flat trajectory of H2/CO2 curve. Hydrogen yield stay consistent for all fuels between temperatures 600 °C to 700 °C. Beyond 700 °C hydrogen production starts to drop despite dry reforming still thermodynamically feasible because dry reforming reaction produces less hydrogen in comparison to steam-reforming. The RWGS reaction can also be observed from steady H2/CO (indicating formation of CO) and H2/H2O (consumption of hydrogen and formation of water) curves. Due to exothermic nature of WGS reaction, as the temperature increases, the reaction feasibility decreases until the RWGS is thermodynamically more feasible [46]."
9,Engine exhaust exergy analysis,"3.2 Engine exhaust exergy analysis To compute fuels savings for both steady and transient engine operation, exergy analysis is conducted. The potential fuels saving can be calculated for available exhaust gas exergy to avoid overestimation of heat recovered. Exergy helps to compute maximum extractable or useful energy in a system and its environment. It accounts losses due to irreversibility in the form of entropy change. Fig. 12 shows, available exergy flow per kg/s of exhaust gas at range of S/C conditions (0.5–4.0) and reactor inlet temperature conditions (500 °C–950 °C). The exergy difference was computed between inlet and outlet temperatures of the reactor. The inlet temperature serves as a heat source temperature for the reformer and hence utilised as the environmental reference for the system. Exergy maps for all fuels show that above S/C = 2.5 all the fuels demonstrate negligible extractable exergy. This is due to prominence of oxidation reactions with increase in S/C and hence difference between reactor’s inlet and outlet temperature decreases. This reduces the exergy available due to no significant temperature gradient between the reactor and its environment. Methanol exhibits significantly less range of conditions where extractable exergy is available, whereas, overall, iso-pentanol shows maximum potential for heat recovery similar to iso-octane. As the fuel chain-length increases, the range of conditions where exergy is available increases too. This agrees with the published literature [24,47]. Therefore, for maximum heat recovery, longer chain fuels are beneficial. Whereas, for low temperature reforming, shorter chain alcohols can be utilised where reforming reactions are driven by the oxidation of reforming fuel. It can also be noted that maximum specific exergy is available for all the fuels at higher temperatures which is logical as at higher temperature the endothermic reactions will dominate, and the heat required for the reactions to proceed will come from the engine exhaust instead of fuel oxidation reactions (fuel penalty)."
10,Heat recovery analysis,"3.3 Heat recovery analysis From the available exergy, maps of energy recovery for all fuels were computed over a range of IMEPs and engine speeds (0.4–8.8 bar and 1000–3000 RPM respectively). The recovered heat represents the portion of total engine power recovered from waste exhaust heat. The heat recovery maps are shown in Fig. 13 which are derived by optimising amount of reformed gas for maximum heat recovery under steady state operation. Recovered heat is obtained using Equation (8). (8) Heat R e c v e r y ( % ) = exhaust e n e r g y r e c o v e r y r a t e engine p o w e r × 100 Heat recovery trends almost identically reflect the exergy maps’ trends. At low engine loads and low engine speeds, the energy recovery is minimal due to low temperatures and low exhaust mass flows. Under these conditions the reforming reactions are mostly driven by oxidation reactions hence extracted energy is significantly lower. However, as the engine load and speed increases, performance of heat recovery system increases due to rise in exergy available from the exhaust. This trend was also reported in alcohols reforming study conducted by Nguyen et al. [24]. From Fig. 12 (a), methanol exhibits lower extractable exergy from exhaust at low temperatures and lower heat recovery at low engine loads and speeds albeit highest waste-heat recovery of 5% at higher loads and speeds (Fig. 13(a)). Ethanol showed similar trend, although higher heat-recovery is seen at low engine load and engine speeds. At higher loads and higher REGR rates, lower S/Cs can be utilised due to increased exergy content in the exhaust. Fuel savings for medium engine loads and speeds increase with fuel chain length. Iso-propanol, n-butanol, and iso-pentanol recovered up-to 3% of waste-heat at medium engine loads. This suggests high exergy recovery for these fuels for medium engine load and engine speed operation due to higher endothermicity of reforming reactions of the fuels compared to smaller chain fuels but enough energy in the exhaust to derive endothermic reforming reactions without much help from oxidation reactions. Iso-pentanol showed heat-recovery for majority of the engine conditions with maximum waste energy recovery of up-to 4% of engine power. Iso-octane illustrated similar trend, albeit iso-pentanol performed better overall. This is logical, as longer chained fuels require very high energy from the exhaust to derive the reforming reactions. Fennel et al. reported exhaust heat recovery of 3.4% of engine power at 105Nm@2100RPM engine condition and 2.4% at 50Nm@3000RPM where gasoline as a reforming fuel was used [9]. The model predicted waste heat-recovery of 3.3% and 2.8% respectively at the same engine conditions. The predicted recovered exhaust heat is smaller but comparable to the reported value which could be due to heat loss from the reformer to the surroundings. 3.3.1 Heat recovery over WLTC All the fuels were further evaluated under transient engine operation for energy recovery. The AVL CRUISE M modelled vehicle specified above (section 2.4.2) was operated over WLTC to obtain instantaneous exhaust gas temperatures and exhaust mass flow. The predicted exhaust gas temperature (bTWC, before-turbo) profile over WLTC is shown in Fig. 14 . The system only utilises a small portion of the exhaust as reactant feed for the reforming process and does not interfere with the performance of turbo as demonstrated in our previous study with gasoline used as the reforming fuel [13]. To drive the heat recovery process waste exhaust heat after TWC (aTWC) is utilised. The specific enthalpies of the exhaust aTWC and before-turbo were found be approximately equal due to exotherms in the TWC. The WLTC consists of four different speed phases: Low, medium, high and extra-high. Vehicle speed is lowest in low phase and highest in extra-high region. Consequently, the temperature is highest in extra-high phase and lowest in low phase. Average temperatures in each phase is found to be 445 °C, 546 °C, 573 °C and 648 °C respectively. Heat recovery over WLTC was evaluated using the exergy analysis methodology in section 2.5. The operational S/C of the reactor was optimised to extract maximum exergy at maximum possible reforming efficiency for different REGR rates for all the fuels. While vehicle was stopped the reactor was not utilised and hence the fuel savings were counted as none. Moreover, using the instantaneous exhaust temperatures (Fig. 14) and outlet temperatures of the reactor (thermodynamic reactor results) over each S/C, potential extractable exergy was computed. The operational points of WLTC where extractable exergy was negative for all S/C range, the reactor was not utilised. The heat recovery was calculated by accumulating total rate of energy gain in reformate over the total engine power. Heat recovery (% of engine power) and reforming efficiency for all the fuels over WLTC is shown in Fig. 15 for the three REGR rates: low (10%) (a), medium (20%) (b) and high(30%) (c). To understand the constituents of the reformate energy, hydrogen efficiency for each WLTC phase was calculated for all the fuels (Fig. 16 ). Overall, going from low-speed phase through to extra-high-speed phase of the WLTC, the available exergy increased and hence increased heat recovery. All the fuels have shown distinct heat recovery/hydrogen efficiency despite same engine/vehicle operation conditions. This is due to prominence of reforming reactions i.e. WGS, RWGS, SR and DR being different along with operational S/C being optimised for each fuel at identical temperatures to maximise heat recovery and reforming efficiency. In low-speed, medium-speed and high-speed phases, at low and medium REGR rate configurations, the waste heat recovery rises with increase in fuel chain length for C1-C3 fuels, however fuels with more than 3 carbons exhibited similar heat recovery. In the three aforementioned speed phases, iso-propanol showed highest heat-recovery under low and medium REGR configurations due to highest-reforming efficiency and high hydrogen efficiency shown by iso-propanol. For high REGR rate, iso-octane displayed higher heat recovery. This is to extract maximum waste-heat and hence lower S/C being utilised which is evident from low hydrogen efficiency in Fig. 16. At high REGR rate, methanol showed negligible heat recovery for low and high-speed phases. This is attributed to higher S/C utilised which causes fuel penalty and smaller temperature gradient. Whereas, smaller S/C cannot be utilised due to limited available exergy. For extra-high-speed phase, all the fuels showed increase in heat-recovery with increase in REGR rate. For all three REGR configurations, bio-alcohols performed better than iso-octane. Methanol exhibited high heat-recovery under high-load and high-speed conditions as is observed for steady state operation. Overall, potential of heat recovery system under WLTC operation is best utilised by iso-propanol and iso-pentanol. 3.3.2 CO2 savings over WLTC The bio-alcohols examined in this study can be synthesised sustainably [16,48,29], thus further Well-to-Wheel greenhouse gas emission benefits are expected. Discounting the gasoline replaced by the H2 rich reformate in the combustion chamber, CO2 reductions can be estimated. Fig. 17 shows average Well-to-wheel CO2 reduction for all the fuels over WLTC. All fuels displayed different CO2 reductions although same engine/vehicle running conditions were used, this is because for each fuel, reforming products differ which results in different heating content of the reformate. The optimised operational S/C differed for each fuel to maximise heat recovery and reforming efficiency. Methanol produced highest accumulative H2 moles during the WLTC for REGR 10% and 20%, however ethanol and iso-pentanol produced more CO and CH4 which results in higher heating content in the reformate. For high REGR, iso-pentanol produced 32%, 13%, 3% more accumulative H2 moles than methanol, iso-propanol and n-butanol respectively with ethanol edging ahead by 1%. Overall, iso-pentanol contained more heating content in the reformate for medium and high REGR hence more gasoline was replaced in the combustion chamber resulting in highest CO2 reductions. Maximum CO2 reduction in excess of 8% was observed for iso-pentanol with all other alcohols demonstrated at-least 5% reduction in carbon emissions. This study accounts only the waste exhaust heat recovery in the reforming process. However, reformate combustion introduces changes in combustion characteristics and engine throttling. This contributes to further increases in engine’s thermal efficiency and reduction in fuel consumption. Therefore, overall fuel savings are possible even if the reforming efficiency is below 100%. A study conducted by Fennel et al. reported 4% fuel savings with overall gasoline reforming efficiency less than 87% [13]. Although, up-to 8% of fuel savings were reported when the reforming efficiency reached 114% where heat-recovery of 2.4% of engine power was obtained [13]."
11,Conclusion,"The impacts of the fuel amount and reactant’s feeds rate on exhaust heat recovery and reforming process efficiency are investigated for five bio-alcohols. A methodology is developed to couple results of an engine model and a fuel reforming reactor model for computation of the waste heat recovery from the engine exhaust gas and how this translates to vehicle CO2 and fuel savings. The impact of aliphatic (C1–C5) bio-alcohols for on-board thermo-chemical exhaust waste heat recovery, H2 production and hence fuel savings for a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine has been investigated. With increasing fuel chain-length, waste exhaust heat recovery increased due to rise in endothermicity of reforming reactions. Hence, specific extractable exergy was higher for longer chain alcohols over variety of reformer operation conditions. Cleaner combustion and reduction in pumping losses which are not accounted in this study may add to the engine and vehicle fuel savings overall. For steady state operation, shorter chain alcohols exhibited negligible waste energy recovery for low engine loads, low engine speeds. Although for high loads and high engine speeds, heat recovery of 5% of total engine power was seen for methanol, highest in all the studied fuels. Overall, iso-pentanol is observed to be a promising candidate for on-board fuel reforming with significant waste-heat recovery with respect to the engine power over the low (up-to 2%), medium (up-to 3%) and high load (up-to 4%) operation. Over WLTC, waste-heat extraction is observed for all the examined fuels. Extra high-speed phase of WLTC showed the highest heat-recovery for all the fuels due to highest exhaust exergy available. Iso-pentanol and iso-propanol showed highest heat-recovery in excess of 8.0% of the engine power for the extra-high-speed phase. Over the WLTC, on average, comparing the bio-alcohols, iso-pentanol illustrated potentially highest waste-heat recovery of 5.3% of engine power. Although, iso-octane illustrated highest waste-heat recovery of 5.7% of engine power. Investigating the impact of thermochemical heat recovery system on CO2 emissions, utilisation of bio-alcohols in contemporary powertrains can cut carbon emissions by ~8%."
