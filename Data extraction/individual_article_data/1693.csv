0,Introduction,"The excessive use of fossil fuels is one of the primary causes of global warming and acid rain, which have started to affect the earth's climate, weather condition, vegetation and aquatic ecosystems. Considering the global environment, there is a pressing need to develop non-polluting and renewable energy source. As a sustainable energy source, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. It is a clean and environmentally friendly fuel, which produces water instead of greenhouse gases when combusted. Furthermore, it has a high energy yield (122kJ/g), which is about 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels, and could be directly used to produce electricity through fuel cells [1,2]. Generally, there are four available basic processes for the production of hydrogen from non-fossil primary energy sources. These processes include: (1) water electrolysis; (2) thermo-chemical processes; (3) radiolytic processes; and (4) biological processes. For global environmental considerations, biohydrogen production from renewable organic waste represents an important area of bioenergy production [3–5]. Biological hydrogen can be generated by several ways. Hallenbeck and Benemann [6,7] described the fundamentals of biological hydrogen production: light-driven processes and dark fermentations. Nandi and Sengupta reviewed the photosynthetic and fermentative biological routes of hydrogen production [8]. Many studies have reported on the groundwork for biohydrogen production systems through photosynthesis [9–11]. However, hydrogen production by fermentative bacteria is technically simpler than that by photosynthetic bacteria. Because it does not rely on the availability of solar energy with large surface area and transparency of the mixed liquor of the wastewaters stream [12]. Gustavo et al. [13] reviewed fermentative hydrogen production from various substrates by different inoculum. These substrates not only included pure carbohydrates, such as glucose [14–16], xylose [17], sucrose [18–20] and lactose [21], but also molasses [22] and starch [23]. Besides, fruit waste [24], palm oil mill effluent [25], food waste [26–28] and other organic solid waste [29,30] was studied focusing on feasibility and process parameters of fermentative hydrogen production. Most of the inoculums for fermentative hydrogen production were pure culture (such as Clostridium sp.). Clostridium sp. is obligate anaerobes which are very sensitive to minute amounts of dissolved oxygen. In order to grow Clostridium sp. for hydrogen production, addition of expensive reducing agents (such as l-cysteine) may be required, reducing the feasibility in practical applications [31]. Therefore, some researchers use a mixed culture as inoculum. This mixed culture includes other fermentative hydrogen production facultative anaerobes (such as Enterobacter sp.). Yokoi et al. [32] have utilized a mixture of Enterobacter sp. and Clostridium sp. to produce hydrogen under a reducing agent-free culture medium and thereby lowering the cost of hydrogen production. Treatments of sludge used as mixed inoculum (including heating, chemical acidification, adding methanogens inhibitor, freezing and thawing, sterilizing and sonication) have been investigated as a method for increasing hydrogen production by altering the nature of the anaerobic microbial communities [33,34]. Hydrogen-producing anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium species form endospores when unfavorable environmental conditions are encountered by bacterial stresses (e.g., elevated temperature, chemicals, and radiation) [35,36]. If the activities of non-spore-forming hydrogenotrophic methanogens are inhibited by the dominance of spore-forming hydrogen- producing bacteria, the fermentation may possess a significant capacity for the conversion of organic wastes into hydrogen [14,20]. Selection of a proper pH is also crucial to enhance hydrogen production, due to the effects of pH on hydrogenase activity or metabolic pathways [37]. Some investigators [38,39] reported that maximum hydrogen yield was determined at a pH value of 5.5. Whereas Lee et al. [40] reported that the maximum hydrogen yield was achieved at initial pH 9.0. Cheong et al. [41] found maximum hydrogen yield under culture conditions of initial pH 7. These conflicting results seem to be due to the initial pH of the culture without maintained buffering capacity for preventing a decrease of pH. Little information is available on the biohydrogen production characteristics and mechanism from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) by mixed culture. As a major burden to the environment, the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) amounts to 170 million tons in 2006 in China, and this number is growing by 6% per year [42]. Nearly 60% of MSW is organic fraction such as kitchen waste, waste paper and urban greening waste. To treat OFMSW by fermentative hydrogen production, not only alleviates conflict between energy supply and demand in a certain extent, but also improves economic feasibility for MSW treatment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics and mechanism of biohydrogen production from the individual OFMSW by batch experiments using mixed culture as inoculum. For this purpose, seven varieties of typical organic materials were selected and their hydrogen production characteristics were studied. These materials included rice, potato, lettuce, lean meat, oil, fat and Banyan leaves which represent natural starches, cellulose, protein, vegetable lipid, animal lipid and lignocellulose materials widely existed in OFMSW."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed microorganisms,"2.1 Seed microorganisms The seed used in this study was heat treated anaerobic sludge. The sludge was originally obtained from an swine manure anaerobic digester and acclimatized with kitchen waste for 2month at 37°C. Firstly, the sludge was introduced into the anaerobic reactor, then the kitchen waste was added once a week and the adding amount increased step by step. Prior to use, the sludge was sieved to remove bone, sand and other coarse matters. Thereafter, the sludge was boiled for 15min to inactivate the hydrogentrophic methanogens and to enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria. The pH, ammonia nitrogen, alkalinity, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and volatile suspended solid (VSS) were 9.2, 230mg/L, 860mg/L, 119mg/L and 3750mg/L."
3,Experimental substrate,2.2 Experimental substrate The materials used in this study are given in Table 1 . All feed amount of substrate was 8.0g (calculated by VS) except meat of 5.0g in order to avoid ammonia inhibition [43].
4,Experimental setup and procedure,"2.3 Experimental setup and procedure A 500ml serum bottle used as a reactor was placed in the water bath at 37±1°C. The substrate and 200mL inoculum were added into the bottle. For the nitrogen-poor substrates (including rice, potato, oil, fat and banyan leaves), 5ml NH4HCO3 solution of 200g/L was added to supplement nitrogen source. Total substrate concentrations in reactor were adjusted to 20g-VS/L by adding distilled water except meat of 12.5g-VS/L. The initial pH was adjusted to 5.5 by adding 2mol/L HCl or 2mol/L KOH in this study. The headspace of the reactor was filled with pure N2 to assure the anaerobic condition. Mixing was conducted twice a day manually. The anaerobic digestion was finished until no gas was produced. Each experimental condition was carried out in duplicate."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Total solid (TS), volatile solid (VS), ammonia nitrogen and alkalinity were determined using standard techniques [44]. Heat values were determined by WGR-1 heat value analyzer. Elementary analysis was determined by Vario EL element analyzer. The pH was determined by pHS-3C pH meter. Biogas production was measured by the displacement of saturated brine solutions. The gas volumes were corrected to a standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (1atm) (STP). The compositions of biogas (H2, CH4 and CO2) were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). The operational temperature at the injection port, the column oven and the detector were 100°C, 70°C and 150°C respectively. Argon was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min. Liquid samples were centrifuged with 8000rpm at 0–4°C and filtrated with 0.45μm filter. The concentrations of VFAs and alcohols were determined using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6820) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The packed capillary column (DB-FFAP) was 30m×0.25mm with inner diameter 0.25μm. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min and split ratio was 1:50. The operational temperature of injection port and detector were 250°C and 300°C. The initial temperature of oven was 40°C for 5min, then increased to 140°C at rate of 10°C/min and maintained for 1min, subsequently increased to 250°C at rate of 5°C/min and maintained for 3min. The VFAs and alcohols analyzed included acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. The hydrogen production efficiency was evaluated using the hydrogen content (HC) in the biogas, hydrogen yield (the ultimate hydrogen production per gram VS, HY, mL/g-VS), volumetric hydrogen production rate (the hydrogen production from 1L culture per day, VHPR, mL/(Lculture ∙d)) and specific hydrogen production rate (the hydrogen production from 1g of dry biomass per day, SHPR, mL/(g-VSS∙d)). The modified Gompertz equation was used to describe the progress of cumulative hydrogen production obtained from the batch experiments [45]. Using the cumulative hydrogen production data to fit the modified Gompertz equation, the maximum hydrogen production rates were estimated. (1) H ( t ) = P × exp { − exp [ R m × e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } , Where H (t) is cumulative hydrogen production (mL), P hydrogen production potential (mL), R m maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/d), e =2.71828, λ lag-phase time (d) and t time (d)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogen production potential for different substrates,"3.1 Hydrogen production potential for different substrates Fig. 1 shows the cumulative hydrogen production and hydrogen content. For the carbohydrates substrate (including rice, potato and lettuce), gas production began immediately after the inoculation. The produced gas was found to consist of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Methane was never detected during the incubation of each substrate. During the first 2days, cumulative hydrogen production rapidly increased and then reached a plateau for each substrate. Hydrogen concentration increased sharply and reached a maximum value of 70% at 3days, 55% at 1day, and 67% at 1.5days for rice, potato and lettuce respectively. But they declined to 26%, 22% and 17% finally. The decrease in hydrogen concentration was likely to be associated with the consumption of hydrogen. However, no methanogenesis was observed throughout the experiment due to the inhibition of methanogenic activity by thermal treatment. This implies that hydrogen might be utilized by some other microorganisms, such as homoacetogens [46,47]. The hydrogen yields for rice, potato and lettuce were 134mL/g-VS, 106mL/g-VS and 50mL/g-VS respectively. It is noticeable that there was a lag time of about 15h for rice. For the protein substrate, only 18mL gas was produced during the hydrogen production fermentation of lean meat. No hydrogen was detected during the incubation with carbon dioxide as main gas component. For the lipid substrate (including oil and fat), the gas production was less than that using carbohydrates as the substrate. A hydrogen yield of 6.25mL/g-VS indicates that about 0.1% of oil was converted to hydrogen based on COD. Unpredictably, no hydrogen was produced with fat as a substrate. For the lignocellulose substrate, a hydrogen yield of 1.75mL/g-VS indicates that less than 0.1% of banyan leaves was converted to hydrogen based on COD. Fig. 2 shows the modified Gompertz equation curves fitted using the cumulative hydrogen production data for rice, potato and lettuce. The hydrogen production potentials, the maximum hydrogen production rates and lag-phase time were estimated using modified Gompertz equation. The results are given in Table 2 . The hydrogen production potential of lettuce was less than that of rice and potato, since cellulosic carbohydrate was more recalcitrant to degradation compared with amylaceous carbohydrate. Several studies have also reported hydrogen production from various carbohydrates by pure culture and mixed cultures in batch, continuous, and cell immobilization reactors. Table 3 lists the results of these studies including HY, VHPR, SHPR and HC for comparison. Generally, the unit of hydrogen yield was mol H2 / mol substrate or mL H2 / mol substrate which were reported in previous studies when substrate was pure carbohydrate (such as glucose and sucrose). But it is difficult to determine the molar amount of complex mixture, so in this paper, the units of hydrogen yields are unified to mL/g-VS at standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (1atm) (STP). As shown in Table 3, hydrogen yield is dependent on substrate, seed, reactor type and culture conditions. Moreover, these factors are interactional, such as temperature, pH and substrate concentration [19]. In general, the hydrogen yield of cellulosic carbohydrate (such as microcrystalline cellulose and lettuce) was less than pure and amylaceous carbohydrate, because hydrogen production from them requires hydrolysis reaction which requires long time."
8,Production of soluble intermediate metabolites,"3.2 Production of soluble intermediate metabolites The production of hydrogen accompanied VFAs and alcohols production during the anaerobic fermentation of organic substrate. The concentration and distributions of VFAs have been used as a useful indicator for monitoring hydrogen production [48]. The VFAs and alcohols concentrations at the end of fermentation were given in Table 4 . The main intermediate metabolites were VFAs with negligible alcohols. The VFAs concentrations were in line with hydrogen yields since VFAs were byproducts of hydrogen production fermentation. From the results of intermediate metabolites, it is concluded that the degradation of meat, oil, fat and banyan leaves were limited. The production of VFAs lowered the pH for the rice, potato, lettuce, oil and fat. Whereas the fermentation of meat increased pH since the degradation of meat produced ammonia. The same phenomenon was observed during the fermentation of banyan leaves, it was likely some alkalescent compounds were produced. However it is required to be warranted. The concentrations of dominating VFAs and their fraction in SMP are given in Table 5 . Among them, butyrate and acetate were the main intermediate metabolites for rice, potato and lettuce, accounting for more than 75% (w/w) of the total VFA and alcohols, suggesting a butyrate-type fermentation in this experiment. The results also suggest that the mixed culture used in this study possessed clostridial characteristics as evidenced by the typical hydrogen/acid- producing phases. The VFAs can be stimulatory, inhibitory or even toxic to the fermentative bacteria depending on their concentrations. A low level of VFAs may have no effect or a stimulatory effect on hydrogen production. However, at a high level, VFAs can lead to severe inhibition on hydrogen fermentation. It is presumed that the VFAs in their undissociated forms can freely permeate the bacteria cell membrane [52]. If the undissociated VFAs are pumped into the culture, they will penetrate the plasma membrane and dissociate depending on the pH inside cell. Thus, the pH inside the cell will be lowered. To prevent unfavorable physiological conditions within the bacteria cell, excess energy must be used to pump ions, e.g. potassium ions, from the culture. Therefore, the energy used for bacteria growth is reduced and the bacteria growth rate will be lowered [53]. On the other hand, if a high level of dissociated VFAs is present in the culture, the ionic strength in solution will increase. Such an increase can result in cell lysis. The effects of VFAs on the fermentative bacteria are associated with the buffer capacity (such as pH and alkalinity values). One of the criteria for judging fermentation stability is the ratio of VFAs/alkalinity. There are three critical values for this [54]: <0.4 fermentation should be stable; 0.4–0.8 some instability will occur; >0.8 significant instability. In this study, the ratio of VFA/alkalinity at the end of fermentation for rice, potato and lettuce substrate were far more than 0.8 which resulted in severe inhibition. It can be concluded that the removal of VFAs is required in order to produce hydrogen continuously. On the other hand, the energy contained in VFAs and alcohols should be further recovered. The hydrogen production fermentation followed by methane fermentation or photo-fermentation can realize this objective. During the following step, organic acids are converted to methane by methanogen or to hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria."
9,Biohydrogen production characteristic of components of OFMSW,"3.3 Biohydrogen production characteristic of components of OFMSW 3.3.1 Carbohydrates Fermentative hydrogen production usually proceeds from the anaerobic glycolytic breakdown of sugars. The majority of microbial hydrogen production is driven by the anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate, formed during the catabolism of various substrates. Acetate and butyrate are formed during hydrogen -producing fermentations. (2) Glucose + 2 H 2 O → 2 Acetate + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ G 0 = − 206.3 kj / mol (3) Glucose → Butyrate + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 ′ = − 254.8 kj / mol It is favorable thermodynamically using carbohydrate substrate to produce hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation. In theory, acetate fermentation is capable of generating 4mol H2 /mol glucose. This is the so-called “Thauer limit” [55]. Yield of hydrogen by butyrate fermentation carried out by some clostridia are lower than that of acetate fermentation. Several study results indicated that actual hydrogen yields were lower than 4mol that were theoretically possible, typically ranging from 0.5 to 2.5mol H2/mol hexose. In fact, the intermediate metabolites often are a mixture of acetate and butyrate: (4) 4 Glucose → 2 Acetate + 3 Butyrate + 8 CO 2 + 8 H 2 For this fermentation, the yield is 2mol H2/mol glucose. Approximately 50% of clostridia isolated to date carry out this mixed acids fermentation. Other fermentation pathways were found in sacchrolytic clostridia, such as the production of propionate by Clostridium arcticum, succinate by Clostridium coccoides, and lactate by Clostridium barkeri. 3.3.2 Lipids Glycerol and long chain fatty acids (LCFA) are mainly produced from anaerobic hydrolysis of lipids. Glycerol could be a substrate for hydrogen production and for solvent production with saccharolytic clostridia [56]. It is apparent that glycerol may be suitable substrate for solvent production rather than hydrogen production. The degradations of LCFA (β-oxidation) are thermodynamically unfavorable reactions unless the hydrogen partial pressure is maintained to an extremely low level: (5) n − LCFA → ( n − 2 ) − LCFA + 2 Acetate + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 = + 48 mj / mol (6) Pyruvate + Acetate + 2 H 2 → + CO 2 + H 2 O Δ G 0 = − 95.4 kj / mol It only proceeds at very low partial pressures of hydrogen, below 10−3 atm, when the free energy change is negative. This low partial pressure is realized in some natural anaerobic digestions where the produced hydrogen is consumed timely by hydrogenotrophic methanogens permits the reaction thermodynamically favorable. But hydrogenotrophic methanogens are absence in hydrogen production reactor where extremely low hydrogen partial pressure can not be maintained. Moreover, LCFA are one of the inhibitors for anaerobic bacteria [57]. They adhere to cell wall of bacteria which restricts the transportation of nutrition. Therefore, it may be difficult to produce hydrogen from long chain fatty acids. Because a large portion of chemical oxygen demand (COD) of lipid is converted to long chain fatty acids during the hydrolysis reaction, even if glycerol could have high hydrogen production potential, hydrogen production from lipid may not be high. In fact, hydrogen production yields of oil and fat were very low in this study. 3.3.3 Proteins Protein is hydrolyzed to various amino acids by extracellular enzymes. There are three types of amino acid degradation reactions under anaerobic condition [55]:1) Stickland reaction (7) Alanine + 2 glycine → 3 acetate + 3 NH 3 + CO 2 2) Oxidative deamination from sole amino acid (8) Leucine + 3 H 2 O → isovalerate + HCO 3 − NH 4 + + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 = + 4.2 kj / mol 3) Reductive deamination from sole amino acid (9) Glycine + H 2 → acetate + NH 3 Δ G 0 = − 77.8 kj / mol All degradation of amino acids involves production of volatile fatty acids and ammonia. The concentration of ammonia produced correlated with the amount of amino acids (proteins) degraded. Therefore, the degree of protein degradation can be known by observing ammonia concentration. In this study, when lean meat was used as a substrate of hydrogen production fermentation without NH4HCO3 added, ammonia was produced and the concentration was higher than that of other substrate fermentation with NH4HCO3 added. It can be concluded that the lean meat was degraded partially. An 18mL gas also testified this conclusion although the gas was carbon dioxide without hydrogen produced. There are some reasons why hydrogen was not produced. Firstly, hydrogen is not produced by Stickland reaction. Moreover, approximately 90% of amino acids degradation is carried out by Stickland reaction [58]. Secondly, oxidative deamination from sole amino acid is thermodynamically unfavorable reactions unless the hydrogen partial pressure is maintained to an extremely low level. Thirdly, amino acids such as glycine, which was degraded by reductive deamination can consume hydrogen as an electron donor [58]. Therefore, even if hydrogen is produced from oxidative deamination, the hydrogen can be utilized by reductive deamination. From the above, it may be difficult to produce hydrogen from substrate which includes a large quantity of protein. 3.3.4 Lignocelluloses Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin compose lignocellulose which has a complicated structure. For untreated natural lignocellulose materials, it is difficult to degrade. In most cases, the cellulose fibers are embedded in a matrix of other structural biopolymers, primarily hemicelluloses and lignin. Complicated structure feature limits the rate and extent of hydrolysis [59]. Therefore, it is very difficult to produce hydrogen from lignocellulose substrate unless suitable pretreatment is adopted."
10,Conclusion,"1) Boiling treated anaerobic sludge is an effective mixed inoculum for fermentative hydrogen production from OFMSW. 2) Among the OFMSW, carbohydrates is the most optimal substrate for fermentative hydrogen production compared with proteins, lipids and lignocelluloses. 3) The hydrogen production potentials of three individual carbohydrates were measured: rice 134mL/g-VS, potato 106mL/g-VS, and lettuce 50mL/g-VS. The hydrogen percentages of the total gas produced from rice, potato and lettuce were 57–70%, 41–55% and 37–67%, respectively. 4) In order to produce biological hydrogen continuously, the intermediate metabolites (including VFAs and alcohols) should be removed timely to avoid inhibition. On the other hand, intermediate metabolites should be utilized by a suitable secondary process step to increase the energy yields of the waste. The methane fermentation or photo-fermentation is suggested as secondary step to produce methane or hydrogen."
