0,Introduction,"Fusion-based preparation for the production of pharmaceutical formulations are gaining increased attention in the last decades. Specifically, among the several approaches adopted for the enhancement of API’s poor aqueous solubility (including the formation of soluble prodrugs and salts (Clas et al., 2014; Jain et al., 2015), the reduction of API’s particle size in either micro- or nano- scale (Merisko-Liversidge and Liversidge, 2011), the preparation of co-crystals (Pindelska et al., 2017), the formation of cyclodextrin complexes (Loftsson and Brewster, 2010), the use of ionic liquids (Huang et al., 2019) etc.) the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) with the use of fusion-based techniques, such as Hot-Melt Extrusion (HME) and KinetiSol® dispersing, is widely adopted nowadays (Ellenberger et al., 2018; LaFountaine et al., 2016b; Repka et al., 2018). In addition, fusion-based formulation processes are an integral part of more sophisticated pharmaceutical formulation approaches, such as three dimensional (3D) printing via Fused Deposition Modelling (where hot-melted extrudates are used as filaments (Long et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018) and injection molding (Claeys et al., 2015; Quinten et al., 2012). In most of the cases (i.e. when a fusion-based formulation approach is adopted) an API(s) and a thermoplastic matrix-carrier(s) are co-melted in suitable devices (such as a single or a twin screw extruder) in order to form a miscible (in most of the cases) melt, which, in turn, is cooled down to form a glassy API/matrix-carrier solid dispersion or solution (Huang and Williams, 2018; Vasconcelos et al., 2016). In addition to process related parameters, several material attributes affect the formation, the physicochemical and thermomechanical properties of such systems, including both matrix-carrier’s and API’s characteristics (such as glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting point (Tm), hydrophilicity, plasticizing ability, glass forming ability, content ratio etc.) (Lin et al., 2018). However, despite the large number of published studies, only a limited number of products have been marketed till today (Edueng et al., 2017; Vasconcelos et al., 2016). In order to solve some of presented drawbacks, new process-related techniques have been introduced, such as HME with direct capsule filling (Li et al., 2014; Ouyang, 2012), while new scientific research efforts continuously emerge in order to improve the physical stability and the physico-mechanical properties of such systems (Cicala et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019; Maniruzzaman et al., 2013; Meere et al., 2019). In this respect, and in order to further address these limitations, scientists are still researching for new matrix-carrier systems with improved processability (Desai et al., 2018; Mencik et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a semi-crystalline amphipathic component, is a non-ionic water soluble polymer available in a range of grades with various degrees of hydrolyzation (a measure of the ratio of hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol to hydrophobic polyvinyl acetate groups) and polymerization (LaFountaine et al., 2016a; Mori et al., 2018). The ratio of alcohol to acetate groups affects crystallinity, with increased alcohols leading to higher crystallinity, while fully amorphous PVAs are obtained only in high polyvinyl acetate contents (DeMerlis and Schoneker, 2003). Additionally, the ratio of alcohol to acetate groups highly affects PVA’s solubility and swelling properties. Based on these characteristics, PVA (especially PVAs with relatively high degree of hydrolysis, around 87.0–89.0%, called partially hydrolyzed PVAs) has attracted the attention of many formulation scientists working on fusion-based pharmaceutical processes (Brough et al., 2016; Mori et al., 2018). However, despite the increased interest, there are two major limitations that make PVA’s thermal treatment extremely difficult: i) the semi-crystalline nature of the polymer, which restricts its extrudability at temperatures below its melting point, and ii) its thermal degradation (elimination of hydroxyl and acetate side groups, forming water and acetic acid) which occurs after its melting (Alexy et al., 2002; Goodship and Jacobs, 2009; LaFountaine et al., 2016a). In order to overcome these limitations, and to improve PVA’s thermal processibility, plasticizers may be added. Generally, when a plasticizer is used, it occupies the sites among the polymer chain and, consequently, it prevents chain–chain interactions leading to a significant reduction in frictional forces between chains (Almeida et al., 2012). This leads to the lowering of the extrusion temperature (effectively limiting the risk of thermal degradation) improving flow (during extrusion) and reducing brittleness of the end product (Almeida et al., 2012). Considering the above, and despite the fact that the significance of plasticizer’s addition in PVA-based fusion pharmaceutical formulation processes has been widely recognized, to the best of our knowledge only a limited number of studies deal with this matter (De Jaeghere et al., 2015; Melocchi et al., 2016). Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate, for the first time, the effect of widely used pharmaceutical plasticizers on the thermo-physical and physicochemical properties of partially hydrolyzed PVA, used in fusion-based pharmaceutical formulation processes. Specifically, the effect of six (6) plasticizers (namely: mannitol, MAN, sorbitol, SOR, sucrose, SUC, triethyl citrate, TEC, anhydrous citric acid, CA, and polyethylene glycol, PEG) was evaluated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), hot-stage polarized light microscopy (HSM), powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR analyses. In addition, the plasticizing ability of the investigated additives was evaluated by measuring the Melt Flow Index (MFI) of suitable PVA-plasticizer blends, while molecular simulation (namely molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations) were employed in order to gain an insight into the binding affinity and molecular interactions occurring among the studied components."
1,Materials and methods,

K48576902, Merck & Co, New Jersey, USA) and PEG400 (Kollisolv® PEG 400, lot no. 74882375L0, BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) were all kindly donated by Rontis Hellas (Athens, Greece). All other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received."
3,Preparation of PVA-plasticizer melt mixtures,"2.2 Preparation of PVA-plasticizer melt mixtures PVA-plasticizer dispersions were prepared by co-melting approach (30% w/w plasticizer to PVA content was used in all cases). Briefly, appropriate amounts of PVA were mixed with plasticizers in a mortar and pestle and then heated at 200 °C for 5 min until a homogeneous melt dispersion (verified visually and via polarized light microscopy) was obtained. The dispersion was then rapidly cooled in an ice bath, without temperature control, and subsequently pulverized at room temperature with mortar and pestle, before being sieved through 300 μm sieve. All samples were placed in hermetically sealed amber glass vials and stored in a desiccator at room temperature (25 °C) in order to prevent moisture absorption prior to testing."
4,Miscibility evaluation,"2.3 Miscibility evaluation 2.3.1 Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) Component miscibility was evaluated with the aid of HSP estimated by the Hoftyzer-Van Krevelen group contribution methods. In this context, the total solubility parameter (δt ) of a molecule describes its ability to interact with other molecules based on the contributions of molar volume (V), dispersion (Fd ), polar (Fp ) and hydrogen bonding (Eh ) forces (Breitkreutz, 1998): (1) δ t = δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ h 2 (2) δ d = ∑ i F di ∑ i V i , δ p = ∑ i F pi 2 ∑ i V i , δ h = ∑ i E h ∑ i V i where δd, δp , and δh are the partial solubility parameters for intermolecular dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding forces, respectively. According to Greenhalgh et al., components are immiscible when Δδt > 10 MPa1/2, miscible when Δδ t < 7 MPa1/2 and likely to form a glassy solid solution when Δδt < 2 MPa1/2 (Greenhalgh et al., 1999). 2.3.2 Hot stage polarized light microscopy (HSM) HSM was used for the experimental evaluation of component’s miscibility during melting. Specifically, physical mixtures of PVA and plasticizers (at a ratio of 70:30 w/w PVA to plasticizer) were heated from 25 °C until complete melting (at a rate of 10 °C/min) on a Linkam THMS600 heating stage (Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd, Surrey, UK), mounted on Olympus BX41 polarized light microscope, and controlled through a Linkam TP94 temperature controller. Evaluation of miscibility was made by visual observation."
5,Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),"2.4 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC measurements were performed in a DSC 204 F1 Phoenix heat flux (NETZSCH, Germany). Specifically, DSC pans containing accurately weighted amounts (~5.0 mg) of samples (pure PVA, MAN, SOR, SUC, CA and PVA-plasticizer mixtures at a 70/30 w/w PVA to plasticizer ratio) were melt-quenched by heating up to 5.0 °C above the melting point of PVA with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, keeping it isothermal for 3 min, in order to erase any thermal history, cooling at a rate of 10 °C/min to 20 °C, before re-heating again at the same rate up to approx. 10 °C above PVA’s melting point. The instrument was calibrated for temperature using benzophenone, indium, and tin. The enthalpic response was calibrated using high purity indium. The melting point temperature (Tm) was determined as the onset temperature of the heat flow curve, the glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined as the inflection point temperature of the heat flow curve, while the enthalpy of fusion (ΔΗf) was determined as the integrated area of the total heat flow curve. The standard deviations of temperatures and enthalpies determined in this work were not higher than 1.0 °C and 3.0 J/g, respectively. Thermograms were analyzed using the NETZSCH Proteus – Thermal Analysis software package version 5.2.1 (NETZSCH, Germany). All experiments were conducted in triplicate."
6,Powder X-ray diffracrometry (pXRD),"2.5 Powder X-ray diffracrometry (pXRD) pXRD patterns of the pure components (PVA and plasticizers) and the PVA-plasticizer melt mixes (prepared according to Section 2.2) at zero time (immediately after preparation) and after three (3) months of storage at 25 °C, were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku - Miniflex II) with a Cu Kα radiation source for crystalline phase identification (λ = 0.15405 nm for Cu Kα). All samples were scanned from 5 to 60° 2θ."
7,ATR-FTIR spectroscopy,"2.6 ATR-FTIR spectroscopy Possible molecular interactions between PVA and the tested plasticizers were experimentally evaluated via ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Specifically, the ATR-FTIR spectra of pure components, physical mixtures and melt mixtures were obtained in the region of 750–4000 cm−1 using a Shimadzu IR-Prestige-21 FT-IR spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan), coupled with a horizontal Golden Gate MKII single-reflection ATR system (Specac, Kent, UK) equipped with ZnSe lenses after appropriate background subtraction. Sixty-four (64) scans over the selected wavenumber range at a resolution of 4 cm−1 were averaged for each sample."
8,Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA),"2.7 Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) TGA was performed in a Shimadzu TGA-50 thermogravimetric analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Approximately 5.0 mg of sample were placed into an aluminum sample pan, which was attached to a sensitive microbalance assembly, and heated from 25 to 300 °C at a rate of 10 K/min, using nitrogen as purge gas at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. Additionally, in order to verify that the preparation method of melt dispersions described in Section 2.2 does not induce PVA’s thermal decomposition, TGA was performed on pure PVA by placing approximately 5.0 mg of PVA into an aluminum sample pans, heating from 25 to 200 °C (at a rate of 10 K/min) and keeping it isothermal for 30 min at that temperature. All experiments were performed in triplicate."
9,Melt flow index (MFI),"2.8 Melt flow index (MFI) The MFΙs of pure PVA and PVA-plasticizer melts (at a 30/70% w/w plasticizer to PVA content) were measured at several temperatures (namely 190, 200, 210 and 220 °C) by using CEAST’s Melt Flow Quick Index (CEAST, Turin, Italy) according to the ASTM standard D 1238-04 and ISO standard 1133 (load 2.16 kg)."
10,Molecular simulations,"2.9 Molecular simulations 2.9.1 Preparation of initial structures The initial structure of PVA (50 monomers) having a 90% degree of hydrolysis (five hydroxyl units were replaced with acetyl units) was prepared using VEGAZZ v.3.1.2.39 (Pedretti et al., 2004). The initial structures of TEC, CA and PEG400 were obtained from a previous work (Barmpalexis et al., 2018), while the initial structures of MAN, SOR and SUC were obtained from PubChem (CID: 6251, 5780 and 5988, for MAN, SOR and SUC, respectively). After setting the initial molecular structures all materials treated as non-periodic structures were optimized (energy minimization) using the pcff_d force field (Sun et al., 1994) with XenoView v.3.7.9.0 suite (Shenogin and Ozisik, 2007). During geometry optimization tolerance was set at 1.00E−4 kcal/mol, while maximum displacement per iteration was set at 10 Å. A total of ten structures (for each component) were optimized and those with the lowest energy were selected for further analysis. Xenoview’s amorphous builder was used to generate the amorphous molecular structure of all compounds at 298 K by varying the rotatable torsions using the free rotation model method. The total energy of 10 independently generated simulation boxes containing either: four (4) PVA chains, thirty (30) PEG chains or sixty (60) plasticizer molecules (i.e. MAN, TEC, CA, SOR and SUC) having dimensions corresponding to each compound’s pycnometric density (i.e. PVA = 1.35 g/mL, MAN = 1.51 g/mL, TEC = 1.14 g/mL, CA = 1.66 g/mL, SOR = 1.29 g/mL, SUC = 1.59 g/mL, PEG400 = 1.12 g /mL determined experimentally with a helium pycnometer, Ultrapycnometer 1000, Quantachrome Instruments, USA) were minimized via steepest descent algorithm with 1.00E−4 kcal/mol tolerance and a 10 Å maximum displacement per iteration in order to remove unfavorable interactions and attain the lowest energy state. The structure with the lowest energy was selected for further processing. 2.9.2 Molecular docking simulations The binding affinity of plasticizers with PVA, characterizing the mutual compatibility of the systems was estimated via molecular docking simulations. During molecular docking, PVA was treated as receptor and the plasticizers as ligands, taking various orientations against the receptor. AutoDock-Vina software program (Trott and Olson, 2010) was used for the preparation of the compound structures (non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged and Kollman united-atom type charges and solvation parameters were added (Morris et al., 1998)), and the binding affinity values were calculated using an extension of force-field-based scoring functions considering hydrogen bonds, solvation and entropy contributions (Trott and Olson, 2010). 2.9.3 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations Following the minimization process from Section 2.9.1, MD simulations were performed in two phases: equilibration and production, based on Gupta et al. (Gupta et al., 2013). Initially an equilibration phase was employed where all prepared structures were relaxed via MD simulations for 2.0 ns under the NVT ensemble at 473 K (melting temperature of PVA) with pcff_d force field, 1.0 fs time step and Berendsen thermostat, followed by a further 2.0 ns processing under NPT (variable volume and shape) at atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) and 473 K, using a cut-off radius of 10.0 Å, spline distance of 1 Å, Berendsen thermostat, Andersen barostat, and 1.0 fs time step. Especially in the case of PVA, the resultant structure was further relaxed for another 2.0 ns at 800 K under NVT and an extra 2.0 ns under NPT at 473 K (with similar MD parameters as previously) in order to obtain a well-relaxed polymer structure with equilibrated density. In order to ensure the validity of the simulation the criteria suggested by van Gunsteren and Mark were taken into account for model development, force field selection, sampling scheme setup, and software selection/usage (Gunsteren and Mark, 1998). In the case of structures containing both PVA and plasticizer(s), a similar approach was followed by constructing well relaxed cells containing 30% w/w of plasticizer to PVA (i.e. one fifty monomer PVA chain with three SUC or TEC molecules, five MAN, SOR or TEC molecules and two PEG400 polymeric chains). 2.9.3.1 Tg calculation for PVA In order to verify that the MD constructed PVA structure is valid, polymer’s Tg was calculated by MD and compared to experimentally obtained data. Specifically, for the estimation of PVA’s Tg a MD simulation was followed by employing a cooling process with temperature dropping from 473 K to 293 K (a step of 10 K was employed). At each temperature, a total 200 ps NPT ensemble dynamics was carried out – 150 ps for equilibration and 50 ps for data sampling – and the Tg was calculated by plotting the averaged specific volume values (ν) against temperature. At each temperature, the final configuration of the MD run was used as the starting structure for next step. 2.9.3.2 Determination of compound’s solubility parameter at 473 K Using the relaxed structures obtained from the equilibration phase in Section 2.9.3, a NPT MD simulation was performed for 200 ps, with the same MD parameters. The final 50 ps of the trajectory captured during this production phase were used for computing the cohesive energy (Ecoh ) and solubility parameter (δ) for each compound according to the following equation: (3) δ = E coh V where V is the volume estimated by MD simulations. 2.9.3.3 Interaction energy (Einter) Einter is a characteristic parameter which can represent the interaction force of components in composite system. The interaction energy can be evaluated by the total energy of the blends and each component in the system according to the following equation (Macháčková et al., 2013): (4) E inter = E tot ( P V A / p l a s t i c i z e r ) - E tot ( P V A ) - E tot ( p l a s t i c i z e r ) where Etot(PVA/plasticizer) is the energy of the polymer/plasticizer system, Etot(PVA) is the energy of pure PVA and Etot(plasticizer) is the energy of the pure plasticizer. 2.9.3.4 Radial distribution function (RDF) The RDF, g(r), was calculated for PVA’s oxygens around plasticizer’s oxygens at 473 °C in order to gain an insight into the molecular interactions during melt processing."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Miscibility and mutual compatibility evaluation,"3.1 Miscibility and mutual compatibility evaluation Component miscibility and mutual compatibility are crucial factors affecting the preparation and physical stability of any polymer-plasticizer system. Immiscibility and mutual incompatibility may lead to phase separation between the two components (polymer and plasticizer), leading to system’s physical instability. In this respect, the miscibility and mutual compatibility of PVA with the selected plasticizers was evaluated both theoretically (via HSPs and molecular docking simulations) and experimentally (via HSM). Additionally, miscibility of compounds was evaluated at 200 °C (melting temperature of PVA) with the aid of MD simulations (see results in Section 3.7). 3.1.1 HSP results Table 1 summarizes the HSP values along with the difference (Δδt, in absolute values) between the estimated HSPs for all systems. Results showed that, at least according to the HSPs, MAN, SOR, SUC and CA are miscible with PVA, since the absolute difference in HSP values was less than 7.0 MPA1/2 (namely 4.9, 2.3, 0.2 and 4.6 MPA1/2 for PVA-MAN, PVA-SOR, PVA-SUC and PVA-CA respectively). In contrary, Δδt values above 10.0 MPA1/2 were obtained for TEC, and PEG400 (Δδt of 13.0 and 11.1 MPA1/2, for TEC and PEG400, respectively), indicating that these plasticizers are probably immiscible with PVA. 3.1.2 Molecular docking simulations In a further step, the binding affinity between PVA and the selected plasticizers was evaluated theoretically (via molecular docking simulations) in order to gain an insight into the mixing energy of components (i.e. their mutual solubility). Fig. 1 (A) shows the optimized molecular structures (after energy minimization) for all components, while Fig. 1(B) shows the most stable PVA-plasticizer poses (based on the conducted simulations) along with their calculated binding affinity values. Results showed that PVA had the lowest binding affinity with SUC (−5.0 kcal/mole) followed by TEC (−3.9 kcal/mole), indicating that, at least according to molecular docking simulations, the polymer has higher mutual compatibility with these two plasticizers. CA, MAN and PEG showed similar binding affinity values (−3.5, −3.5 and −3.4 kcal/mole, respectively), while SOR showed the highest binding affinity value (−2.9 kcal/mole) suggesting lower mutual compatibility with PVA compared to the rest of the plasticizers. 3.1.3 HSM results In order to verify the suggested theoretical findings, the miscibility of PVA with all tested plasticizers was evaluated experimentally with the aid of HSM. Fig. 2 shows the HSM obtained photographs at the melting point of the pure PVA and all PVA-plasticizer systems. Based on the obtained results, miscibility between PVA and the tested plasticizers was observed only in two (2) out of the six (6) cases. Specifically, PVA was miscible only with MAN and SOR, while immiscible melts were observed in the case of SUC, TEC and PEG400, where two distinct separated melt zones (corresponding to the polymer and the plasticizer) were observed. In the case of CA, an aggregated dark mass was formed simultaneously with PVA’s melting, indicating that the system is thermally instable (thermal stability of all systems is being evaluated in more details via TGA in Section 3.5). These results indicate that both theoretical approaches followed were not suitable to adequately predict PVA’s melt miscibility/solubility with the tested plasticizers. One explanation for this, is probably the fact that both approaches (i.e. HSPs and molecular docking simulations) do not account for the thermophysical properties of compounds, and generally, the effect of temperature on the mutual miscibility/compatibility of components."
13,DSC results,"3.2 DSC results Fig. 3 shows the DSC thermograms of the pure components and PVA-plasticizer mixtures. PVA showed a Tg (accompanied with a small relaxation endothermic peak) at 49.6 °C followed by a single melting endotherm at Tmelt 179.9 °C (ΔΗf = 42.05 J/g), while CA, SUC, SOR and MAN showed a single melting endotherm at 158.3 °C (ΔΗf = 127.38 J/g), 190.8 °C (ΔΗf = 110.40 J/g), 99.3 °C (ΔΗf = 146.67 J/g), and 168.2 °C (ΔΗf = 284.90 J/g), respectively. In the case of PVA-CA mixtures, DSC thermogram from the 1st heating scan showed a Tg at 46.3 °C (corresponding to the glass transition of PVA) followed by two melting endotherms at 136.6 °C (ΔΗf = 4.55 J/g) and 179.0 °C (ΔΗf = 17.89 J/g), corresponding to the melting of CA and PVA, respectively. Quench cooling and reheating (2nd heating scan) showed the presence of a single Tg at 44.3 °C, while no other thermal events were recorded, indicating that, probably, the PVA-CA are co-dispersed in amorphous state. Similarly, in the case of PVA-SOR, DSC 1st heating scan showed a Tg at 47.4 °C and two melting endotherms at 95.32 °C (ΔΗf = 34.68 J/g) and 177.4 °C (ΔΗf = 7.12 J/g), corresponding to the melting of SOR and PVA, while a single Tg at 45.7 °C was recorded during the 2nd heat scan, indicating that the two compounds were co-dispersed in amorphous state. In the case of PVA-PEG400 (liquid plasticizer), the 1st heating scan showed only the characteristic thermal events of PVA (i.e. glass transition at 46.1 °C and melting temperature at 195.8 °C, ΔHf = 32.76 J/g), while after reheating the quenched cooled sample (2nd heating scan), a single Tg was recorded at 44.6.X °C, indicating the amorphization of PVA. Similar results were recorded for PVA-TEC (TEC, as PEG400, is also a liquid plasticizer) with PVA’s Tg and a Tmelt recorded during the 1st heating scan (at 46.8 °C and 194.6 °C, ΔHf = 14.91 J/g), and a single Tg at 45.2 °C during the 2nd heating scan. In the case of PVA-SUC, the 1st heating scan showed PVA’s glass transition at 47.5 °C, followed by a single melting endotherm at 196.6 °C (ΔHf = 57.30 J/g), located between the melting temperatures of pure PVA and SUC, indicating the in-situ co-melting of SUC within the molten PVA during DSC heating. Results from DSC’s 2nd heating thermogram suggested the formation of a PVA-SUC amorphous dispersion since only a single Tg at 45.9 °C was recorded (no other melting or crystallization peaks were recorded). Finally, in the case of PVA-MAN, except for PVA’s Tg at 45.3 °C, DSC 1st heating scan showed only a single melting endotherm located close to the melting points of pure MAN (i.e. at 161.2 °C with ΔHf = 92.34 J/g) indicating the in-situ co-melting of PVA within the molten MAN during DSC heating. Reheating of the quenched cooled sample (i.e. 2nd heating scan) revealed the presence of a single melting endotherm (at 138.4 °C with ΔHf = 21.91 J/g) located significantly lower than both the melting points of pure components, and the melting point of the physical mixture (recorded in the 1st heating scan). This high melting point depression after quench cooling, suggests the formation of a strong molecular interaction between the polymer and the plasticizer. Looking at the above DSC analysis results, it can be concluded that the addition of MAN resulted in a significant reduction of PVA’s melting temperature (1st heating scan), while the addition of PEG400, SOR and SUC, resulted in a significant reduction of PVA’s melting onset (from ~150 °C to ~110–120 °C), indicating that these compounds may be suitable plasticizers for PVA. In contrary, CA and TEC addition to PVA (at least up to 30% w/w) did not significantly altered PVA’s melting characteristics. In addition, DSC results showed that PVA is able to form amorphous dispersions after melt-quench cooling (2nd heating scan) with all tested plasticizers except MAN (where a crystalline (or a semi-crystalline) dispersion is formed). However, keeping in mind that PVA can form miscible melts only with MAN and SOR (HSM results in Section 3.1.3) the absence of melting endotherms during DSC 2nd heating scan, may be attributed to either the formation of two separate (physically unstable) amorphous zones (one amorphous zone for the polymer and one for the plasticizers) or that in some cases (and in some extent) component amorphization is happening in situ during the DSC experiment. Therefore, in order to verify the physical state of the PVA-plasticizer systems proposed by DSC, pXRD analysis was employed."
14,pXRD results,"3.3 pXRD results Fig. 4 shows the pXRD diffractograms of pure components along with the PVA-plasticizer melt dispersions immediately after preparation and after three months (3 M) of storage. In the case of PVA, pXRD revealed an amorphous halo along with a characteristic strong crystalline reflection at 2θ ~19.5° and a shoulder at ~22.6° (representing the reflections of (1 0 1) and (2 0 0) from a monoclinic unit cell (Ricciardi et al., 2004)) indicating that the polymer is semi-crystalline. CA, SUC, SOR and MAN showed high crystallinity with characteristic 2θ reflections at 15.2, 18.3, 19.3, 22.7, 24.8, 27.4, 32.8 and 41.7° for CA, 8.3, 11.6, 13.05, 18.8, 19.6, 24.8, 25.2, 30.9 and 31.9° for SUC, 12.8, 19.0, 19.6, 20.5, 21.9, 22.9, 25.7, 26.9, 29.0, 29.3, 31.9 and 34.0° for SOR (indicative of type γ polymorph) and 10.5, 14.6, 18.8, 20.5, 21.2 and 23.4° for MAN (indicative of type β polymorph). TEC and PEG400 are amorphous liquids and hence their pXRD diffractograms were not collected. In the case of PVA melt dispersions with PEG400, TEC, MAN and SOR, pXRD diffractograms of the samples analyzed immediately after preparation (zero time) showed that PVA remained semi-crystalline after processing, since both characteristic 2θ reflections at ~19.5° and ~22.6° were recorded in all cases. Additionally, no characteristic peaks were recorded for MAN and SOR indicating that both plasticizers remained amorphous (at least immediately after the melting process). In the case of SUC and CA, a loss in PVA’s crystallinity was observed for both PVA-plasticizer systems (polymer’s characteristic shoulder at ~22.6° was not recorded) while both plasticizers were amorphously dispersed after processing (no characteristic pXRD peaks were observed for both plasticizers). Therefore, based on the above pXRD results in zero time, MAN, SUC, CA and SOR were all amorphously dispersed within the PVA matrix, while in the case of SUC and CA PVA’s crystallinity was also reduced. pXRD diffractograms of PVA-plasticizer melt dispersions after three months of storage (3 M) were also recorded and shown in Fig. 4. In the case of PVA-PEG400 and PVA-TEC, similar diffractograms to zero time were reordered (i.e. both characteristic crystalline peaks for PVA were present in 3 M and zero time diffractograms) indicating good physical stability upon storage. Similarly, the pXRD diffractogram of PVA-SOR melt dispersions stored for three months, showed no changes compared to zero-time pattern, indicating that PVA remained semi-crystalline, while SOR remained amorphous even after 3 M of storage. In the case of PVA-MAN, results showed the appearance of new pXRD peaks corresponding to MAN re-crystallization and the formation of MAN δ-polymorph (Cares-Pacheco et al., 2014), while in the case of CA, a similar to zero time diffracrtogram was obtained (i.e. CA remained amorphous and PVA showed reduced crystallinity). Finally, in the case of PVA-SUC, along with PVA’s characteristic diffractogram peaks, pXRD analysis showed the formation of several new peaks corresponding to SUC recrystallization, indicating that during storage, the dispersed plasticizer moves towards a more thermodynamically stable conformation (i.e. from amorphous to crystalline)."
15,ATR-FTIR results,"3.4 ATR-FTIR results In a further step, the formation of molecular interactions between PVA and the selected plasticizers was evaluated with the aid of ATR-FTIR. Fig. 5 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of pure components (Fig. 5(A)), along with the spectra of PVA-plasticizer physical mixtures (PM) and melt dispersions (MD) immediately after preparation and after storage for three months (3 M) at 25 °C (Fig. 5(B)). In regards to pure components, ATR-FTIR spectra showed several characteristic absorption peaks all compound. Specifically, for PVA at 3301 cm−1 (stretching of OH), 2929 cm−1 (symmetric stretching of CH2), 1724 cm−1 (stretching of CO from the remaining acetyl groups), 1423 cm−1 (bending of OH and wagging of CH2), 1321 cm−1 (δ(ΟΗ) rocking with CH wagging), 1145 cm−1 (shoulder stretching of CO from the crystalline part of PVA) and 1083 cm−1 (bending of OH from amorphous part of PVA); for MAN between 3400 and 3200 cm−1 (corresponding to the OH stretching vibrations with intermolecular hydrogen bonds, H-bonds), and between 3000 and 2800 cm−1 (characteristic of the CH stretching vibrations); for SOR at 3240 cm−1 (corresponding to OH stretching), at 2984, 2952 and 2917 cm−1 (characteristic of the CH stretching), at 1449, 1371 and 1328 cm−1 (corresponding to CH bending), at 1132, 1093, 1056 cm−1 (characteristic of the CC stretching) and at 879 cm−1 (corresponding to the CO stretching); for SUC at 3310 and 3380 cm−1, and one isolated sharp peak at 3560 cm−1 (corresponding to the OH-stretching), between 3000 and 2800 cm−1 (characteristic of the CH-stretching) and between 1500 and 800 cm−1 (corresponding to CO-stretching, CC-stretching, and COH-bending vibrations); for CA at 3475 cm−1, 3288 cm−1, 1750 cm−1 and 1710 cm−1, corresponding to the OH, COOH and CO stretching vibration, respectively; for PEG400 at 3375 cm−1 and 2910 cm−1, corresponding to OH and CH stretching vibration, respectively; and for TEC at 2958 cm−1 and 1740 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of CH and CO, respectively. In the case of PVA-plasticizer systems, comparison of the ATR-FTIR spectra corresponding to PMs and MDs analyzed immediately after preparation, showed the formation of molecular interactions in the case of PVA-MAN, PVA-SOR and PVA-SUC. This was in agreement with previously published studies, where molecular interactions have been reported between PVA and MAN (during the preparation of a sugarless coating layer (Higuchi et al., 2014)), PVA and SOR (during the preparation of PVA-based packing films (Tian et al., 2017)) and PVA and SUC (during the preparation of transient electronics (Xi et al., 2017)). In the case of MAN and SOR these results are in agreement with the HSM analysis, presented in Section 3.1.3, where both compounds were identified as being miscible with PVA. Specifically, in these cases, ATR-FTIR analysis showed a shift of PVA’s stretching OH to lower wavenumbers, with PVA-MAN showing a higher OH shift (i.e. from 3301 cm−1 to 3253 cm−1 compared to 3201 cm−1 for PVA-SOR), indicating the formation of stronger molecular interactions between PVA and MAN compared to PVA and SOR. This was in agreement also with the DSC analysis presented in Section 3.2, where the reheating of the quenched cooled PVA-MAN showed a single melting endotherm located at a significantly lower temperature compared to the pure components, suggesting thus the formation of strong molecular interactions between the two components. In the case of PVA-SUC, the addition the MD spectra shoed increased intensity of PVA’s peaks corresponding to the CO stretching vibration of the secondary alcoholic groups and the symmetric CsbndC stretching vibrations, indicating the presence of molecular interactions between the two components. For the rest plasticizers, ATR-FTIR spectra of the PMs were similar to MDs, indicating no molecular interactions between the tested components. Finally, no differences were observed in all ATR-FTIR spectra of MDs prepared immediately after preparation and those taken after storage for 3 M, except in the case of MAN and SUC, indicating that for the rest plasticizers the prepared MDs were stable (at least in terms of molecular interactions formed). In the case of PVA-MAN the shift of PVA’s stretching OH to lower wavenumbers observed in zero time samples was reversed, and the obtained FTIR spectra was similar to the initial PM spectra. Similar results were observed also in the case of PVA-SUC (i.e. similar FTIR spectra for PM and 3 M stability). This indicates that probably the presence of moisture water led to the demixing of the PVA-plasticizers and subsequently to the recrystallization of MAN and SUC seen in the pXRD analysis in Section 3.3."
16,TGA results,"3.5 TGA results Fig. 6 shows the TGA thermograms of pure components and PVA-plasticizers. As stated in the introduction, one major limitation that makes PVA’s thermal treatment extremely difficult is its thermal degradation, which occurs after its melting. Results from Fig. 6 shows that PVA’s thermal decomposition starts at approx. 250 °C, with MAN and SOR showing a similar degradation path (i.e. degradation at ~250 °C). In contrary, PEG400 and SUC seem to be more thermally unstable (compared to PVA, MAN and SOR) as their thermal degradation starts from approx. 225 °C, with SUC showing a much higher degradation rate compared to PEG 400, while CA and TEC are highly thermally unstable compounds since their degradation starts from below ~180 °C (below PVA’s melting) and it is completed at ~250 and ~280 °C, respectively. Additionally, it is important to note that PVA’s thermal trace in Fig. 6 shows a minor weight loss (~1.7% by weight) starting at ~50 °C, which can be attributed to the presence of free water. In general, the presence of residual water, which may act as a plasticizer itself or as crystallization inducing agent affecting several thermophysical and physicochemical properties of such melt dispersions, should be carefully monitored as it may lead to several stability-related problems. In regards to PVA-plasticizer mixtures, the addition of MAN, SOR and PEG400 showed good thermal stability (degradation starts after ~250 °C), indicating that their addition does not worsens PVA’s thermal degradation, while SUC led to less thermally stable PVA mixtures with degradation staring from ~225 °C. In contrary, the addition of CA and TEC led to the formation of high thermally unstable mixtures, with degradation staring from ~150 °C and 125 °C, respectively, indicating that the use of both plasticizers in PVA fusion-based pharmaceutical formulation processes should be avoided since it leads to polymer’s thermal degradation. Finally, Fig. S1 shows the TGA thermal profile of the pure PVA at 200 °C vs. time. Results, revealed the presence of a small portion of free water (~1.7% by weight) in PVA (small weight loss starting at ~50 °C), while good thermal stability was observed for up to 30 min. This indicates that the followed sample preparation method described in Section 2.2 is suitable for the preparation of PVA-based melt dispersions since it does not induce PVA’s thermal decomposition."
17,MFI results,"3.6 MFI results Fig. 7 shows the MFIs of pure PVA and PVA mixtures with 30 %wt. MAN, SOR, SUC and PEG400 (i.e. the plasticizers which showed good thermal stability during TGA evaluation). The test was performed up to 220 °C, i.e. the temperature at which PVA-SUC starts to thermally decompose. In general MFI (or else Melt Flow Rate, MFR) is the simplest, standardized (ISO 1133, ASTM D1238) measure of flowability for polymer melts. Increasing MFI values indicate a decrease in melt viscosity, although the measurement does not give a full picture of the flow behavior under different conditions such as shear rate or temperature, nor can it give any indications of viscoelasticity (Aho et al., 2015). Nevertheless, it is a good indicator of the flowability and suitable for quality control or comparative studies. Results from Fig. 7 showed that in all tested temperatures (with the exception of 190 °C for SUC) the addition of plasticizers resulted in higher MFIs, indicating better melt flowability and hence, better processibility compared to pure PVA. Comparison of the MFIs for PVA-plasticizer mixtures, showed that SUC had the lowest impact in terms of melt flow improvement, especially in lower processing temperatures (i.e. 190 °C). In regards to the rest plasticizers SOR and MAN showed higher MRI values in low processing temperatures (i.e. 190 °C), while PEG400 showed better results at higher temperatures (i.e. 220 °C). Therefore, based on the above it can be concluded that the use of MAN, SOR and PEG400 results in a significant improvement of PVA’s melt flow, although it should kept in mind that MFI is measured at a low constant shear rate, and therefore the comparison at higher shear rates, which may prevail in some fusion-based processes such as HME, can lead to wrong conclusions (Aho et al., 2015). However, the use of MRI may still be a good indicator for the initial screening of suitable PVA plasticizers."
18,Molecular dynamics simulations,"3.7 Molecular dynamics simulations 3.7.1 PVA’s Tg Fig. S2 shows the prepared amorphous cell of PVA (containing four 50 monomer chains) after the followed relaxation process, while Fig. 8 shows the obtained ν vs. T diagram, where a monotonic increase in ν is observed. The points in Fig. 8 were divided into two groups corresponding to the glassy and rubbery state. In each case, a separate straight line was fitted via linear regression and Tg was calculated by the intersection of the two regression lines. One point near the estimated Tg that did not show a clear physical state (rubber or glass) is excluded from the regression analysis according to Maus et al. (2008). MD simulations showed a Tg value at 343 K (i.e. 70 °C) which is in close agreement with a recently published study estimating PVA’s Tg via MD simulations at 350 K (Noorjahan and Choi, 2013), although in the latter a fully hydrolyzed PVA was modelled, in contrary to the partially hydrolyzed structure used in the current study. Additionally, the estimated Tg value was in good agreement (a small overestimation is observed) with the experimentally determined value (i.e. 49.6 °C by DSC). In general, such overestimation in Tg values are expected due to the time-dependent nature of the glass transition phenomenon during MD simulation (time in nanoscale) which results in faster cooling rates and hence, in early vitrification (Gupta et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the selected MD parameters can be considered reliable based on the near agreement between the measured and the experimentally determined Tg values. 3.7.2 Einter Fig. S3 shows the constructed MD amorphous cells after relaxation, containing the tested plasticizers (i.e. 60 molecules in the case of MAN, SOR, SUC, TEC and CA, and 20 polymer chains in the case of PEG400) used in order to estimate the total interaction energy between plasticizers and PVA according to Eq. (4). Results presented in Table 2 showed that the PVA-MAN, PVA-SOR and PVA-SUC exhibited the lowest Einter (i.e. −2528.8, −2451.3 and −2377.2 kcal/mol, respectively) indicating that these are the most stable PVA-plasticizer systems. This results are in agreement with the ATR-FTIR analysis, where significant molecular interactions were observed only for these systems. 3.7.3 Miscibility evaluation In order to account for the effect of temperature on component’s miscibility, MD simulations were employed and the solubility parameters of components (δMD ) were estimated at 200 °C based on Eq. (3). Results in Table 1, showed a close agreement between the calculated HSPs (via Hoftyzer-Van Krevelen group contribution method) and the estimated δMD . However, in contrary to HSP based miscibility evaluation, where MAN, SOR, SUC and CA were identified as being miscible with PVA (i.e. Δδt < 7.0), MD simulations showed miscibility only for the three out of the four components (i.e. MAN, SOR and SUC). This was closer to the experimentally determined results (HSM analysis in Section 3.1.3) where only MAN and SOR were identified as being miscible with PVA during melting. 3.7.4 MD trajectory analysis Interactions occurring between PVA and the selected plasticizers were also evaluated by generating the radial distribution functions, g(r), between the oxygen atoms of PVA and plasticizers (Fig. 9 ). In such diagrams, donor-acceptor distances between 2.2 and 2.5 Å can be characterized as strong interactions, while distances between 2.5–3.2 Å and 3.2–4.0 Å are considered as moderate and weak interactions, respectively. Results showed a peak at 2.85 Å, 2.87 Å and 2.90 Å for PVA-MAN, PVA-SOR and PVA-SUC, respectively, indicating the presence of molecular interactions between the polymer and the selected plasticizers. This is in agreement with the experimental observation via ATR-FTIR were molecular interactions were observed only in the cases of MAN, SOR and SUC."
19,Conclusion,"The present study showed that the selection of suitable plasticizers for PVA fusion-based pharmaceutical applications is a nontrivial procedure. Specifically, among the several plasticizers evaluated in the present study, CA and TEC showed good physical stability upon storage, however they were immiscible with PVA and led to extensive thermal degradation. PEG and SUC, although both immiscible with PVA, they were able to reduce PVA’s processing temperature and maintain acceptable thermal stability with PVA-PEG showing remarkably improved melt flow characteristics compared to PVA-SUC. On the other hand, MAN and SOR (both miscible with PVA) were able to significantly reduce PVA’s processing temperature and improve its melt flow properties without affecting its thermal decomposition, while SOR was amorphously dispersed within the PVA matrix compared to MAN which recrystallized upon storage. MD simulations were in close agreement with the experimental observations, indicating that they can be considered as a promising tool for modelling such systems."
