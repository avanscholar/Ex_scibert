0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation is a core process in the chemical industry that is typically conducted batch-wise in an excess of pressurised H2 to maximise product yield [1]. Current hydrogen production involves high temperature reforming processes [2]. Issues of safe handling, sustainable synthesis (12 kg CO2 generated per kg H2) and (production and distribution) cost [2] are the drivers for the search of alternative hydrogen sources and/or hydrogen donors. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation typically employs an organic hydrogen carrier (i.e. sacrificial donor) in tandem with a homogeneous catalyst [3] where generation of stoichiometric quantities of organic waste requires multiple separation/purification steps to isolate the target product and facilitate catalyst reuse [3]. The potential of heterogeneous catalysts (e.g. Pd [4], Ru [5], Fe [6], Pt [7] and Cu [8]) has been flagged [9] but work to date has focused on batch liquid systems that suffer from high operating pressure (typically 20−45 bar) [10,11], formation of by-products [12] and separation requirements for catalyst reuse. The feasibility of coupling endothermic and exothermic reactions over heterogeneous catalysts has been addressed in a recent review by Siddiki et al. [13]. We examine here an ambient pressure continuous coupling of (endothermic) non-oxidative dehydrogenation with (exothermic) hydrogenation to generate two valuable products without an external hydrogen supply. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), dehydrogenation (Step I) releases hydrogen (with Product 1) that is transferred (Step II) and used in hydrogenation with the formation of Product 2 through Step III. This requires two different active sites for hydrogen production and utilisation. We have focused on the continuous dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of biomass-derived 2-butanol/furfural [14,15] to valuable 2-butanone (1.2 million tons world production per year [16]) and furfuryl alcohol (130,000 tons world production per year [17]) (Fig. 1 (b)), which can be readily separated by distillation due to the (90 K) difference in boiling points [18]. Prior work has established selective furfural→furfuryl alcohol hydrogenation over supported Au catalysts [19] while alcohol → carbonyl compound hydrogen transfer is possible through a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) mechanism when the active sites for −OH and -C=O adsorption/activation are in close proximity [20]. Moreover, we have demonstrated viable coupling of (2-butanol→2-butanone) dehydrogenation with furfural hydrogenation over a physical mixture of Cu/SiO2+Au/CeO2 [21]. Hydrogenation rate in the coupled system is governed by the supply of hydrogen which depends on the amount (i) generated in 2-butanol conversion and (ii) transferred across the surface of the carrier. Alcohol adsorption/activation occurs at the Cu-oxide interface with the hydrogen-end binding to support basic sites [22]. The studies that have quoted a catalytic response for alcohol (e.g. isopropyl [23] and benzyl alcohol [24]) dehydrogenation towards changes in catalyst basicity are scarce [23,24], although they point to higher activity with increased basicity. The Lewis basicity (capacity for electron donation) of the carrier can impact on the cleavage of the OH bond, but we could find no reported correlation with hydrogen production. In addition, the redox nature of the oxide carrier can impact on the nature and mobility of hydrogen, as discussed in a recent paper by Wang et al. [25]. Up to date, most of the work has been conducted with pure H2 over perfect/clean oxide surfaces [26] and under conditions that differ significantly from those in standard transfer hydrogenation reactions using homemade/commercial oxide carriers. Herein, we evaluated the role of the support in determining hydrogen generation and transfer capacity with a view to maximising furfuryl alcohol production. We have examined a group of oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2) and address hydrogen utilisation efficiency by direct comparison with conventional hydrogenation using an external supply of hydrogen. The sustainability of the coupling process was quantified using the green metric environmental factor (E-factor, kgwaste kgproduct −1) [27]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The supports employed in this study (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All the gases used in this work (O2, H2, N2 and He) were of ultra high purity (>99.99 %, BOC). Furfural (≥99 %), furfuryl alcohol (≥99 %), 2-methyl furan (99 %), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (99 %), furan (≥99 %), 2-butanol (≥99 %), 2-butanone (≥99 %), octanone (98 %) and octanol (≥99 %) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation and activation Au/CeO2 was prepared by deposition-precipitation using urea (99 %, Riedel-de Haën) as basification agent. An aqueous solution of urea (100 fold excess) and HAuCl4 (6 × 10−4 M, 300 cm3; 99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the support (5 g) and the suspension stirred and heated to 353 K under reflux (2 K min-1). The pH progressively increased to reach 7 after 3−4 h as a result of thermal decomposition of urea. Copper on Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2 was prepared by an equivalent deposition-precipitation procedure using Cu(NO3)2 (3 × 10-3 M, 300 cm3; 99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) as metal precursor. The NaOH (2 M; ≥97 %, Fisher Scientific) base was added to an aqueous solution of the metal precursor containing the support (5 g) until pH = 10, heated to 353 K and aged under vigorous stirring for 4 h to ensure homogeneous deposition of Cu(OH)2 [28]. The solid was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water until pH = 7 and dried in 45 cm3 min-1 He at 373−393 K overnight. The catalyst precursors were sieved (ATM fine test sieves) to mean particle diameter =75 μm and activated at 2 K min-1 to 573 K in 60 cm3 min-1 H2. After activation, the catalysts were cooled to ambient temperature and passivated in 1 % v/v O2/He for off-line characterisation."
4,Catalyst characterisation,"2.3 Catalyst characterisation The Au and Cu loading was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer with an air-acetylene flame from the diluted extract in aqua regia (25 % v/v HNO3/HCl). H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), H2 chemisorption and total specific surface area (SSA) measurements were conducted on the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome Instrument) unit with data acquisition/manipulation using the TPR Win™ software (version 1.0). Samples were loaded into a U-shaped Pyrex glass cell (3.76 mm i.d.) and heated in 17 cm3 min−1 (Brooks mass flow controlled) 5 % v/v H2/N2 at 2 K min−1 to 573 K, swept with 65 cm3 min−1 N2 for 1.5 h, cooled to 453 K and subjected to H2 chemisorption by pulse (10−20 μl) titration. In blank tests, there was no measurable H2 uptake on the support alone. The SSA values were recorded with a (30 cm3 min−1) 50 % v/v N2/H2 flow using the standard single-point BET method. Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed at 423 K for 1 h in N2. SSA and H2 uptake values were reproducible to within ±5 % and the values quoted in this paper are the mean. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, scanning at 0.02° per step over the range 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 90°. The diffractograms were identified against the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. CeO2 (43–1002), Au (04-0784) and Cu (04-0836). Metal particle size and shape post-TPR was examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) on a JEOL ARM 200CF operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The scanned images were collected using either Gatan 806 High Angle Annular Dark Field, Gatan 805 Annular Dark Field/Bright Field or JEOL ADF1 detectors under the control of a Gatan DigiScan II, employing Gatan DigitalMicrograph software (version 2.31) for data acquisition/manipulation. Samples were prepared for analysis by dry deposition on a holey carbon/Ni grid (300 Mesh). The surface area weighted mean metal size (d) was based on a count of up to 800 particles: (1) d = ∑ i n i ⋅ d i 3 ∑ i n i ⋅ d i 2 where n i is the number of particles of diameter d i. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) before and after reaction was employed to determine the presence and type (e.g. light hydrocarbons (soft coke) at 473 ≤ T < 673 K, bulky hydrocarbons (hard coke) at 673 ≤ T < 873 K and carbon layers at T ≥ 873 K, [29,30]) of carbonaceous materials [29,30] deposited on the catalyst surface as a result of reactant/product decomposition [31] using a LINSEIS STA PT 1600 instrument equipped with a Type S 240 furnace (RT-1773 K). Samples (13 × 10−3 – 23 × 10−3 g) were placed in an alumina crucible (i.d. = 7 mm, volume 0.3 cm3) and heated in 100 cm3 min-1 N2 (Platon NGX), at 10 K min-1 to 973 K."
5,Catalytic system,"2.4 Catalytic system Reactions (stand-alone hydrogenation of furfural (in H2), independent dehydrogenation of 2-butanol (in N2) and coupled dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of 2-butanol/furfural (in N2)) were carried out at atmospheric pressure and 453 K, in situ after catalyst activation in a continuous flow fixed-bed tubular reactor (i.d. = 15 mm). Reaction conditions were selected to ensure negligible internal/external mass and heat transfer limitations. A layer of borosilicate glass beads served as preheating zone where the organic reactant(s) was(were) vaporised and reached reaction temperature before contacting the catalyst bed. Isothermal conditions (±1 K) were maintained by diluting the catalyst with ground glass (75 μm). Catalytic performance in a two bed arrangement (Cu/CeO2 on the top bed and Au/CeO2 in the bed below) was examined where each bed was separated by layer (15 mm) of glass wool; catalyst activation followed the procedure described above. Reaction temperature was continuously monitored by a thermocouple inserted in a thermowell within the catalyst bed. The reactant(s) was(were) delivered to the reactor at a fixed flow (2 × 10−2 cm3 min-1) via a glass/teflon air-tight syringe and teflon line using a microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific). Dehydrogenation was conducted in a co-current flow of N2 (20 cm3 min-1) with 2-butanol at GHSV (i.e. ratio of inlet gas flow rate (organic(s)+N2 or H2) to catalyst bed volume) = 3 × 103 h-1 and molar Cu (or Au, n) to reactant feed rate (n/F) = 2 × 10-4 – 4 × 10-4 h. Stand-alone hydrogenation was carried out in a co-current flow of H2 (20 cm3 min-1) with furfural maintained at GHSV = 3 × 103 h-1 with n/F = 1 × 10-3 h, where the H2 content was 90 times in excess to the stoichiometric requirement for furfuryl alcohol production. The coupled reaction was conducted in N2 (20 cm3 min-1) at GHSV = 3 × 103 h-1, n/F = 8 × 10-5 – 3 × 10-4 h, with Cu:Au molar ratio in the range of 12-48. In a series of blank tests, passage of each reactant in a stream of H2 or N2 through the empty reactor or over the (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2) support alone or in a H2 flow (stoichiometric H2/Furfural molar ratio = 1) over Au/CeO2 did not result in any detectable conversion. The reactor effluent was analysed by capillary GC (Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed split/splitless injector and a flame ionisation detector, employing a DB-1 (50 m × 0.33 mm i.d., 0.20 μm film thickness) capillary column (J&W Scientific)). Data acquisition and manipulation were performed using the TurboChrom Workstation (version 6.3.2) chromatography data system. Reactant and product molar fractions (x i) were obtained using detailed calibration plots (not shown). Reactant (i) conversion (X i) is defined by: (2) X i ( % ) = reactant i , in − reactant i , out reactant i , in × 100 and selectivity (S) to product (j) is given by: (3) S j ( % ) = product j , out reactant i , in − reactant i , out × 100 where the subscripts “in” and “out” refer to the inlet and outlet gas streams, respectively. Catalytic activity is also quantified in terms of (i) initial rate (R reaction,process), obtained from time on-stream measurements as described elsewhere [32], according to: (4) R reaction , process = F ⋅ X i n where the subscripts “reaction” and “process” refer to the dehydrogenation (D) or hydrogenation (H) reactions in the coupling and/or stand-alone processes and (ii) turnover frequency (TOF, h−1; rate per active site) calculated based on metal dispersion from microscopy analysis as described elsewhere [33]. Hydrogen utilisation efficiency in the stand-alone hydrogenation vs. coupled process was assessed by: (5) H 2 utilization efficiency = H 2 supplied H 2 consumed where H2 supplied is the amount provided ((i) from an external gas cylinder supply or (ii) via alcohol dehydrogenation) while H2 consumed represents the molar hydrogen utilised in the conversion of furfural. Repeated reactions using different samples from the same batch of catalyst delivered raw data reproducibility and mass balance within ±7 %. The E-factor was determined according to the method described by Sheldon [27], as the ratio of waste produced (i.e. mass of unreacted furfural+2-butanol+H2+N2 in the outlet gas stream) to product synthesised (i.e. furfuryl alcohol+2-butanone)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Conventional stand-alone furfural hydrogenation,"3.1 Conventional stand-alone furfural hydrogenation The physico-chemical properties of the Au/CeO2 catalyst are presented in Table 1 . Total specific surface area (SSA) was lower than the ceria support (49 m2 g−1), suggesting pore blockage by the metal component [34]. The H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profile for Au/CeO2 (Fig. 2 (I)) presents a maximum at 420 K with a 4-fold greater H2 consumption relative to the amount required for the Au3+→Au0 reduction (Table 1), indicative of partial support reduction at the Au-CeO2 interface [35]. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Au/CeO2 (Fig. 2 (II)) matched that of CeO2 with a cubic fluorite structure (JCPDS-ICDD reference 43–1002). There were no detectable diffraction peaks for gold, suggesting metal nanoparticles <5 nm [36]. The representative scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image (Fig. 2 (III)) confirms the formation of nano-scale Au particles (Fig. 2 (IV)) with a mean size of 3.5 nm. Small (≤5 nm) gold nanoparticles with a high concentration of (low-coordination) Au edge and corner positions [37,38], active sites for hydrogen adsorption/activation [39], are essential for significant catalytic activity in hydrogenations [37]. In standard furfural hydrogenation using an external supply of H2, Au/CeO2 promoted exclusive furfural → furfuryl alcohol transformation. In contrast, decarbonylation (to furan (path V) in Fig. 1 (b)), hydrogenolysis (to 2-methylfuran (path VI)) and/or ring reduction (to tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol (path VII)) have been reported for gas phase reaction over (Ta2O5, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2) supported Pt, Ni and Pd catalysts [40]. The Au/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a decline in conversion to reach a pseudo-steady state after ca. 2 h on-stream (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information). The extracted specific furfuryl alcohol production rate (TOF =171 h−1) was significantly greater than that recorded under similar reaction conditions (453 K) over (SiO2) supported Pt (133 h−1 [41]) and Ni (<1 h−1 [42]) catalysts. High selectivity to the target alcohol is a crucial requirement but H2 utilisation must also be addressed in terms of overall process sustainability [43]. Less than 1 % of the H2 supplied was used in hydrogenation over Au/CeO2 (i.e. 3 × 10-5 mol h−1 consumed vs. 32 × 10-3 mol h-1 supplied) with a high associated E-factor = 430, indicative of serious inefficiency [27]. Hydrogen dissociation is rate-determining in aldehyde hydrogenation over Au [44] and the low hydrogen utilisation can be attributed to a limited capacity of Au to chemisorb and activate hydrogen [45]. This is consistent with the significantly lower H2 uptake for Au/CeO2 (65 μmol gmetal −1; Table 1) relative to values reported for supported Pd and Pt catalysts with similar metal loading (1460−1870 μmol gmetal −1) [46,47]. Atomic hydrogen is generated stepwise during alcohol dehydrogenation over zero valent transition metal (e.g. Ni, Pt, Cu) catalysts [48–50]. This active form generated in situ can migrate from the metal nanoparticle to the support, along the oxide surface [51] and across solid/solid grain boundaries [52], to participate in hydrogenation [53] (Step II in Fig. 1 (a)). This supply of active hydrogen in the coupling dehydrogenation-hydrogenation circumvents the limitations associated with H2 activation by Au, while retaining the inherent reaction selectivity. An essential requirement for effective coupling is that dehydrogenation proceeds at an equivalent or greater rate than hydrogenation to ensure sufficient hydrogen supply. There was no detectable activity in stand-alone dehydrogenation (2-butanol in N2) using Au/CeO2 and a second metal is required to promote hydrogen generation from 2-butanol transformation. Copper supported on oxides [54–56] and carbon [57] is effective in gas phase (423−573 K) dehydrogenation (of cyclohexanol [54,55], n-pentanol [56] and ethanol [57]) and was accordingly chosen as our test catalyst."
8,Hydrogen generation from 2-butanol dehydrogenation,"3.2 Hydrogen generation from 2-butanol dehydrogenation A range of oxide carriers were chosen to evaluate the effect of the support on hydrogen production for a similar Cu loading (2–4 % wt., Table 2 ). The total surface area, which ranged from 38 m2 g−1 (Cu/CeO2) to 201 m2 g−1 (Cu/SiO2), is in agreement with values recorded elsewhere [58,59]. The H2-TPR profiles are presented in Fig. 3 where the H2 consumed (Table 2) was close to the requirement for Cu2+ reduction to Cu0. We observed a shift in the temperature of maximum H2 consumption (T max) during H2-TPR from 481−527 K for Cu supported on non-reducible ZrO2/Al2O3/SiO2 to 423−453 K for Cu on reducible TiO2/CeO2. A similar trend of lower temperature reduction of Cu on TiO2 vs. SiO2/Al2O3 [60] and CeO2 vs. Al2O3 [61] has been reported and attributed to strong metal-support interactions [62], resulting in a more facile reduction of the (Cu2+) precursor on reducible supports [63]. There were no detectable Cu XRD diffraction peaks (Figure S2 in Supporting Information), suggesting a well dispersed metal phase [45]. This is consistent with microscopy analysis; STEM micrographs are presented in Fig. 4 (I) with associated Cu histograms (II) for Cu/SiO2 (a) and Cu/TiO2 (b), as representative samples. Both catalysts exhibit Cu particles ≤5 nm with a similar mean size (2−3 nm). The characterisation measurements suggest similar properties for the supported Cu phase in all the catalysts. All the Cu catalysts exhibited an essentially time-invariant activity (see results for Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/TiO2, as representatives, in the inset to Fig. 5 ) and 100 % selectivity to the target 2-butanone with no evidence of dehydration ((path II) in Fig. 1 (b)) or dimerisation (path III)). The combined ultra-selectivity and catalyst stability achieved in this work represents a net improvement compared with reported selectivity to 2-butanone (50–90 %) over Cu catalysts in both liquid- [64] and gas-phase operation [65] and deactivation with time on-stream over Ni colloids [66]. The dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols over supported Cu is structure sensitive [67] and proceeds via a two-step mechanism [48] involving heterolytic cleavage of the OH bond [68] and abstraction of the second H in α-position [22]. Alcohol adsorption/activation occurs at the Cu-oxide interface with the α-hydrogen interacting with Cu and the hydrogen-end of the hydroxyl group binding to support Lewis basic (oxygen anion) sites [22]. The removal of the first H with the formation of a surface alkoxide [69] is rate determining [70] and should be sensitive to oxide Lewis basicity. This, in turn, is related to the partial negative charge of the oxygen in the oxide (-q O) which can be calculated [71,72] (see Supporting Information) and a higher -q O reflects greater Lewis basicity [73]. We quantify dehydrogenation activity in terms of hydrogen production rate and the dependence on -q O is presented in Fig. 5. Hydrogen produced was 2–10 times greater than that consumed in furfural hydrogenation over Au/CeO2 (dashed line in Fig. 5) under the same reaction conditions. We observe a linear increase of activity with increasing -q O (from Cu/SiO2 = 0.15 to Cu/CeO2 = 0.48). A greater Lewis basicity of the oxide oxygen anion (i.e. higher -q O) facilitates hydrogen extraction from the hydroxyl group in 2-butanol to form the alkoxide intermediate which, in turn, increases dehydrogenation rate. In support of this, there is evidence in the literature of greater (oxidative) dehydrogenation rates in the conversion of substituted benzyl alcohol with electron donating groups (vs. aliphatic alcohols) linked to a more facile removal of the acidic hydroxyl H on surface basic sites of a hydrotalcite catalyst [74]. We first examined the coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation (2-butanol + furfural in N2) over Au/CeO2 and Cu-based catalysts in separate runs. There was no coupling to produce furfuryl alcohol over Au/CeO2 and limited hydrogenation activity (R H,coupling ≤ 14 h−1) over all supported Cu catalysts. This demonstrates that only Au or Cu cannot promote both steps (dehydrogenation and hydrogenation) in the coupled reaction."
9,Coupled 2-butanol-furfural dehydrogenation-hydrogenation,"3.3 Coupled 2-butanol-furfural dehydrogenation-hydrogenation The concentration and mobility of reactive surface hydrogen supply to Au determines furfural consumption rate in the coupled process. Hydrogen generated in situ (via 2-butanol dehydrogenation over Cu) can diffuse across a solid-solid boundary [75,76] or desorb associatively and travel in between multiple catalyst beds in series to participate in hydrogenation reactions [77,78]. We examined the coupled process in these two configurations using (i) a two catalytic bed arrangement with Cu/CeO2 (highest dehydrogenation rate among the Cu catalysts) on top and Au/CeO2 (active in furfural hydrogenation) below (Cu:Au molar ratio = 12; see details in Experimental section) and (ii) a physical mixture of Cu/CeO2+Au/CeO2 in a single bed. Adopting the 2-bed arrangement, we observe the formation of furfuryl alcohol and 2-butanone as the only detected products. This result proves that hydrogen generated over Cu/CeO2 is transferred and borrowed by gold. In line with this, hydrogen desorption atT < 453 K was proven using temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) by Liu et al. (over Ru/CeO2) [79] and Sepúlveda-Escribano et al. (Pt/CeO2) [80]. In terms of activity, we recorded a similar conversion with time on-stream profile (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information) and hydrogenation rate relative to that in the stand-alone hydrogenation of furfural over Au/CeO2. This result indicates that hydrogenation activity is governed by the Au component where the hydrogen dissociation/activation capacity of gold determines surface hydrogen concentration and hydrogenation rate. Coupled reaction over Cu/CeO2 and Au/CeO2 in two separate beds was accompanied by a greater H2 utilisation efficiency (from 432 to 3) and a (2-fold) lower E-factor (= 215) relative to stand-alone hydrogenation over Au/CeO2. Full selectivity to target 2-butanone/furfuryl alcohol was retained in the coupled dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of 2-butanol/furfural over a (single bed) Cu/CeO2+Au/CeO2 physical mixture (Cu:Au molar ratio = 12). We recorded a significant (28-fold) increase in specific (per mol of Au) hydrogenation activity which demonstrates the formation of activated H species in the dehydrogenation step [81] over Cu/CeO2 that travel across the CeO2 support [82] and participate in the hydrogenation of furfural over Au/CeO2. This served to overcome the ""inefficient"" H2 activation step by Au (required in the stand-alone process and with a 2-bed configuration), resulting in higher hydrogenation rate, with full hydrogen utilization and a lower associated E-factor (= 15). Hydrogen generation is critical but hydrogenation response is also dependant on hydrogen transfer (between Cu → Au and across the CeO2) which can be influenced by interactions with the support [25]. In order to evaluate the possible support effects in coupled dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process we have assessed the catalytic action of physical mixtures containing Au/CeO2 with added Cu/oxide catalysts in a single bed configuration; the results are shown in Fig. 6 . Full selectivity to furfuryl alcohol and 2-butanone and a (2–28 fold) greater hydrogenation rate (relative to the stand-alone hydrogenation over Au/CeO2) was attained over each physical mixture. The linear correlation between hydrogen supplied (from 2-butanol dehydrogenation) and hydrogenation rate (Fig. 6 (I)) proves that furfural hydrogenation in the coupling process is controlled by hydrogen generation in the dehydrogenation step. Yang et al. [83] linked the observed increase of nitro group hydrogenation rate in the coupling process (ammonia borane dehydrogenation with substituted nitrobenzenes hydrogenation) vs. stand-alone hydrogenation to the high hydrogen generation rate via ammonia borane dehydrogenation. We compared the specific (per mol of Cu) dehydrogenation activity in the coupling process over Cu + Au physical mixtures (R D,coupling) with that in the stand-alone dehydrogenation of 2-butanol (R D,stand-alone) over the oxide supported Cu catalysts and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 6 (II). The greater hydrogen production in the stand-alone dehydrogenation over all the catalysts is indicative of competition between furfural and 2-butanol for adsorption sites [84] that must result in a displacement of 2-butanol by furfural. This is consistent with experimental work that has demonstrated a higher adsorption strength for furfural compared to alcohols on the surface of Cu/SiO2 [85]. Panagiotopoulou et al. [86] concluded a similar inhibiting effect of furfural using a series of alcohols (2-propanol, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol) in the liquid phase production of 2-methylfuran. It should be noted that Cu/Al2O3 deviates somehow from the general trend with an almost equivalent dehydrogenation activity in the coupling process and stand-alone reaction. We tentatively attribute this response to the presence of low-coordination oxygen atoms on the surface of Al2O3 [87,88] that can act as additional adsorption/activation sites for the -C=O functionality in furfural via nucleophilic attack at the polarised Cδ+ [84]. Taking the five physical mixtures presented in Fig. 6, H2 utilisation efficiency decreased in the order: Au/CeO2+Cu/CeO2 (1.00) > Au/CeO2+Cu/ZrO2 (1.02) > Au/CeO2+Cu/Al2O3 (1.19) > Au/CeO2+Cu/TiO2 (2.40) > Au/CeO2+Cu/SiO2 (3.34). These results indicate that the reducibility of the carrier does not impact significantly on hydrogen utilisation efficiency. Indeed, a similar hydrogen utilisation was obtained over (reducible) CeO2 and (non-reducible) Al2O3 supported Cu systems. Taking (non-reducible) Al2O3 and SiO2 we obtained a significant (36 %) difference in hydrogen usage. It is well-known [89] that carbonaceous materials (e.g. carbon layers or coke) can facilitate hydrogen spillover across oxides by transfer as a proton-electron couple (i.e. enhanced mobility compared with transfer as H atoms) [26]. All the supported Cu catalysts exhibited an initial decline in activity with time on-stream to attain a pseudo-steady state after ca. 90 min (Fig. 7 (I)). The degree of catalyst deactivation in the coupling process was quantified in terms of % of activity lost between initial and steady state conversion. Cu/CeO2 and Cu/Al2O3 exhibited the highest deactivation (∼8 %) while Cu/SiO2 and Cu/TiO2 showed a similar (high) stability (∼1 % deactivation). The observed temporal decrease in dehydrogenation activity can be attributed to coke formation, notably on acid sites of the carrier [90], during furfural conversion [91] over (e.g. SiO2 [92] and Al2O3 [93]) supported Cu catalysts. The possible formation of carbonaceous deposits was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis; the results for Cu/SiO2 (a) and Cu/Al2O3 (b), as representatives, are shown in Fig. 7 (II). The fresh (activated in H2) catalyst was carried through as a reference and the signals corrected to ensure that the profiles shown refer solely to carbon deposition during the coupled process. Both spent catalysts displayed a high temperature (>420−700 K) mass loss that can be linked to decomposition of ""soft coke"" (see Experimental section) generated during furfural conversion [29,30]. Over the same temperature range, we observe a (3-fold) greater mass loss over Cu/Al2O3 relative to Cu/SiO2 that can be linked to increased coke accumulation on the more acidic alumina. Likewise, Wan and co-workers [94] studying the synthesis of gasoline from methanol showed (by TGA analysis) higher (3.1 % vs. 0.5 %) coke concentration over zeolites with low (23 vs. 217) SiO2/Al2O3 ratio attributed to differences in acidity. The presence of carbonaceous deposits on the surface of Al2O3 facilitates hydrogen transfer in a similar manner to that on reducible supports as a proton-electron couple which, in turn, results in enhanced hydrogen utilization efficiency. Au/CeO2+Cu/CeO2, which delivered the best combined hydrogenation rate and hydrogen utilisation efficiency, was employed for further analyses. Catalytic coupling over a physical mixture of Cu/CeO2+Au/CeO2, varying the Cu/Au ratio, gave the results presented in Fig. 8 . In each case, 100 % of selectivity to the target 2-butanone and furfuryl alcohol products was achieved. The rate of furfuryl alcohol production was enhanced (from 1600 h−1 to 3800 h−1) with increasing Cu:Au (from 12 to 30) ((I)). This is an important result as it represents a 70-fold greater hydrogenation rate relative to reaction over Au/CeO2 using an external H2 supply (dashed line in (I)). The dependence of hydrogenation rate on Cu:Au ratio coincided with that observed for hydrogen generation from 2-butanol dehydrogenation (Fig. 6 (I)). Hydrogen utilisation efficiency converged at reaction stoichiometry, i.e. full usage by Au/CeO2 of the hydrogen generated by Cu/CeO2 (dotted arrow in (II)). Reaction at higher Cu:Au (= 48) served to increase hydrogen generation with only a marginal increase in furfuryl alcohol production rate. Full H2 utilisation was not achieved in this case, which can be attributed to insufficient Au to promote the hydrogenation step. The coupled process significantly lowered (215-fold) the E-factor to 2, which is at the lower end of the range (5->50) in the fine chemical sector [27]."
10,Conclusions,"Au/CeO2 (mean Au size =3.5 nm) promotes the continuous gas phase hydrogenation of furfural exclusively to furfuryl alcohol but less than 1 % of the hydrogen supplied is utilised in the reaction. A series of oxide (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2) supported Cu (2–4 % wt.) catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation to deliver post-H2-TPR metal nanoparticles with a mean size of 2−3 nm (from STEM). All the Cu catalysts promoted the sole formation of 2-butanone in the dehydrogenation of 2-butanol. The partial negative charge of the oxygen in the support correlated with hydrogen production rate where Cu/CeO2 delivered the highest dehydrogenation activity. A series of Au/CeO2+Cu/Oxide physical mixtures promoted exclusive formation of 2-butanone and furfuryl alcohol in coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation (of 2-butanol/furfural), where surface coverage by carbonaceous deposits facilitates hydrogen transfer, enhancing hydrogen utilisation efficiency. The combination Au/CeO2+Cu/CeO2 delivered full hydrogen utilisation and a 70-fold greater furfuryl alcohol production rate relative to conventional hydrogenation over Au/CeO2. Higher sustainability of the coupling process (vs. standard hydrogenation) is demonstrated with a significantly lower E-factor = 2 (vs. 430). Our results establish the basis for the development of a continuous alternative route for the sustainable production of high value chemicals via single-pot coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation."
