0,Introduction,"Severe global warming and fossil fuel depletion lead to the extensive research in pursuit of clean and renewable energy resources, such as CH4, H2, ethanol and butanol. Among these alternative energy resources, H2 is regarded as a promising energy resource because of its high energy content (122kJ/g). Biological H2 production processes from biomass have become increasingly attractive as a means of producing renewable energy, for their potential and capability to deal with organic wastes from agriculture and industry, whilst generating valuable H2 fuel. The biological processes are mainly divided into two fundamental processes: photo-fermentation and dark-fermentation. In comparison to photo-fermentation, dark-fermentation is technically simpler, owing to its independence on the availability of solar irradiation. Moreover, dark-fermentation is flexible towards various substrates, including glucose, cassava starch, waste ground wheat, cellulose, beet-pulp, and even municipal solid wastes [1–3]. Photo-fermentation on the contrary demands small molecular fatty acids as substrate, such as acetate, butyrate, propionate [4], which can be produced via dark-fermentation. A great deal of effort is currently being made to improve the H2 yield of dark-fermentation, including pre-treatment, optimum operating parameters, fermentative process integration with photosynthesis, and/or nutrient addition. Hydrogenases are the key enzymes during biological H2 production, which can drive the H2 evolution. Two metabolic types for H2 generation in dark fermentation are described: (i) pyruvate:formate lyase (Pfl) in an enteric-type mixed-acid fermentation of facultative anaerobes (e.g. Escherchia coli) and (ii) pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Pfor) in a clostridial-type fermentation of strict anaerobes (e.g. Clostridia) [5,6], involving a Ni–Fe hydrogenase and Fe–Fe hydrogenase, respectively [7,8]. [Ni–Fe] hydrogenases are widely distributed among bacteria [9], and less sensitive to oxygen inhibition than [Fe–Fe] hydrogenases [10]. Both Fe2+ and Ni2+ are supposed to have a major impact on the H2 production process. Karadag and Puhakka [11] reported that the H2 production was enhanced by 71% with the sole iron or nickel supplementation in a glucose-fed Anaerobic Continuous Flow Stirred Tank Reactor (ACSTR) with an initial glucose concentration of 9g/L; the highest yields were obtained at a concentration of 50mg Fe2+/l and 25mg Ni2+/l. Wang and Wan [12] suggested that Fe2+ was capable to enhance the biomass production yield within a certain concentration range and a maximum hydrogen yield of 311.2mL/g glucose was obtained at a Fe2+ concentration of 350mg/L. Yuan et al. [13] investigated the effect of L-cysteine on dark fermentative H2 production and demonstrated that the dark fermentative hydrogen production using anaerobic mixed cultures was significantly enhanced by adding a small amount of L-cysteine (0.1–1.0mM) as nutrient solution and that the metabolic pathways were shifted to produce more acetate and butyrate. Pre-treatment is recommended when biomass is used as feedstock of fermentative H2 production. Wang et al. [14] investigated the effects of HCl hydrolysis and enzyme hydrolysis on the H2 production from apple pomace. In another study boiled and partially hydrolyzed wheat was utilized for hydrogen production [15]. A previous study by Li et al. [3] demonstrated that H2 can be produced by fermentation (i) from carbohydrates, (ii) from long chain fatty acids (LCFA) obtained through anaerobic hydrolysis of lipids, and (iii) from amino-acids produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins in anaerobic conditions. Reaction (ii) and (iii) are less important due to the reaction equilibria, as explained hereafter. Only the reactions of carbohydrates are indeed characterized by a thermodynamic equilibrium in favor of H2 production and expressed by a considerable negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG 0) as illustrated for the fermentative conversion of glucose: (1) Glucose + 2 H 2 O → 2 Acetate + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Δ G 0 = - 206.3 kJ / mol (2) Glucose → Butyrate + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 = - 254.8 kJ / mol The H2 production reactions by the direct pathway from LCFA and/or through complex reactions from amino acids, are characterized by a low but positive ΔG 0, implying that the equilibrium does not favor H2 production unless the partial pressure of H2 is deliberately kept low. (3) n - LCFA → ( n - 2 ) - LCFA + 2 Acetate + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 = + 48 mJ / mol (4) Leucine + 3 H 2 O → isovalerate + HCO 3 - NH 4 + + 2 H 2 Δ G 0 = + 4.2 kJ / mol It is therefore indicated that it is favorable to use starch-carbohydrate as a substrate for hydrogen production, with a theoretical production potential of 4 [reaction (1)] or 2 [reaction (2)] mol H2/mol glucose respectively. Starch was utilized as substrate in this study. Although there are some researches on hydrogen production from starch, most of them need two separate steps (starch hydrolysis and glucose fermentation) to carry out hydrogen production when using starch as substrate. However, the starch hydrolysis and sugar fermentation could take place simultaneously in this study, making the hydrogen production process simpler, because we developed a novel complex microorganism agent with two pure strains A1 and B1. Strain A1 was capable of hydrolyzing starch by secreting amylase while strain B1 was able to produce hydrogen. L-cysteine and/or trace elements, such as Fe2+ and Mg2+, are important for the fermentative H2 production since supposed to be the co-factors of various enzymes. Their effects as well as the effect of substrate pre-treatment on the batch hydrogen production from starch were evaluated. The changes of the metabolites distribution were examined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental set up and procedure,"2.1 Experimental set up and procedure Batch experiments were conducted in 1.2L bottles with 0.9L effective reaction volume. Each reactor was filled with 0.8L fermentation medium, then inoculated with 100mL seed solution. The air in the head space of the reactors was removed by passing argon gas through the fermentation medium and the head space to provide anaerobic conditions. The reactors were placed in a thermostatic bath (35°C) and magnetically stirred to ensure thorough mixing and good mass transfer. A total of 8 reactors was operated in parallel, and indicated hereafter as R1–R8."
3,Medium composition,"2.2 Medium composition The seed medium had the following composition: beef extract (3g/L), peptone(10g/L), NaCl (5g/L). The fermentation medium contained 10g/L starch flour, peptone (2g/L), NaCl (5g/L), KH2PO4(1g/L) and K2HPO4(1g/L), which was previously determined as the optimal composition for H2 production in our former study [16]. The fermentation medium remained the same in all reactors, whilst the specific additions or pre-treatment are given as follows: R1(None); R2(FeSO4⋅7H2O); R3(MgSO4); R4(L-cysteine); R5(L-cysteine+FeSO4⋅7H2O); R6(L-cysteine+MgSO4). FeSO4⋅7H2O was used as Fe2+ source, whereas MgSO4 was the Mg2+ source. Each ion concentration was set as 0.02g/L. L-cysteine was added at a concentration of 0.3g/L. The starch flour in R8 was heated at 100°C for 30min as pre-treatment. R7 was set as a control test without being heated. Experiments were run in triplicate, with average results further reported."
4,Microorganisms,"2.3 Microorganisms The strains A1 and B1 applied in the experiments were screened and isolated from activated sludge used for producing methane-biogas from food waste in our laboratories. A previous study demonstrated that a mixture of pure cultures of A1 and B1, being an amylase-producing strain and acidogenic bacteria, respectively, enhance the hydrogen production in comparison with sole pure cultures of A1 and B1 [16]. The phenotypic identification of A1 and B1 was carried out by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. The results showed that A1 is related to Bacillus sp. and B1 belongs to Brevundimonas sp. Both bacterial strains are scarcely reported in literature for fermentative hydrogen production. The bacteria were first grown on the seed medium. The microorganisms were grown for four to five days at 37°C. The cultures were then transferred to the fermentation medium to produce hydrogen. The initial biomass concentration of the mixed culture was 0.05±0.01g/L, and the ratio of A1/B1 in the seed solution was 2/1(w/w), shown previously to be the optimum [16]."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Samples taken from the liquid phase were analyzed for total sugar concentration, then centrifuged at 10,000rpm to remove the solids, and the clear supernatants were used for the analysis of soluble sugar concentration, volatile fatty acids and alcohols. Total sugar and soluble sugar concentrations were determined by 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic Acid (DNS) Method. Volatile fatty acids and alcohols were determined by using a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID using a second-order temperature-programmed method. Total biogas was sampled from the head space of the reactors. The amount of total biogas produced was determined by water displacement method. The composition of biogas was sampled periodically and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C,SHIMADZU, Japan), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector(TCD) and a TDX-01 packed (3mm inside diameter) stainless steel column (2m×3mm). Argon was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 30mL/min. Temperatures of the column oven, injection, and detector were 160°C, 160°C and 180°C, respectively. The cumulative hydrogen gas production was determined from [17]: V H 2 ,i = V H 2 ,i - 1 + V w C H 2 ,i + V R,i C H 2 , i - V R,i - 1 C H 2 ,i - 1 where V H2;i and V H2;i-1 are the volumes of cumulative hydrogen gas production (mL) calculated after the ith and the previous measurement; V w is the total gas volume measured by the water displacement method (mL); V R,i and V R,i−1 are the volumes of the gas in the head space of the reactor for the ith and the previous measurement (mL); C H2;i and C H2;i−1 are the concentration of H2 in the head space of the reactor for the ith and the previous measurement (%). The biomass concentration in the inoculum was determined by centrifuging 20mL sample at 10,000rpm and drying at 105°C until constant dry weight. The pH of the fermentation medium was monitored by using a pH probe."
6,Comparison with fundamental glucose fermentation reactions,"2.5 Comparison with fundamental glucose fermentation reactions The experimental H2 production was compared with the expected H2 production based upon the measured VFAs. Assuming that acetate and butyrate were responsible for the hydrogen production, as will be confirmed in Section 3.2 hereafter, the calculation equation was described as follows [18]: (5) n ( H 2 ) = 2 n ( acetate ) + 2 n ( butyrate )"
7,Results and discussion,
8,effects of different additions on the hydrogen production,"3.1 effects of different additions on the hydrogen production Gas analysis showed that the biogas produced from the dark fermentation contained only hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Fig. 1 illustrates the variations of cumulative H2 production with time for different additions. The lag phase of H2 production in this study lasted about 24h, while the lag phase of H2 production with a wheat powder concentration of 10g/L lasted 38h in the batch experiments by Argun et al. [15]. The reasons might be differences of the seed microorganism, substrate type, substrate concentration, initial pH value, temperature and substrate pre-treatment between this study and previous studies, all being important factors in fermentative H2 production, affecting the hydrogenases activity and the metabolic pathways [19]. The maximum cumulative H2 production of 1928mL (1.94mol H2/mol glucose) was obtained with the sole Fe2+ supplementation, 104.9% higher than that of the control (941mL, 0.95mol H2/mol glucose). The results demonstrated that the sole Fe2+ addition could largely enhance the cumulative mixed culture H2 production. Hydrogenases, which are responsible for biological H2 production by catalyzing the H2 generation reaction, are metalloproteins. Hydrogenases are classified into three families: [NiFe], [FeFe] and [Fe] hydrogenases, which was initially referred to “mental free hydrogenase” [20], according to the metal atoms of their catalytic sites. Iron ion acts as the active site of hydrogenase. Hydrogenase is the key enzyme that catalyzes proton reduction to produce hydrogen. Iron is an essential element to form hydrogenase and ferredoxin, which is responsible for electrons transfer during hydrogen production process. Moreover, hydrogenases possess Fe–S cluster, and iron is involved in Fe–S protein which can affect protein fuctions primarily as an electron carrier. Hence iron is able to efficiently enhance the hydrogen production by positively affecting the hydrogenase activity of strain B1. However, the sole Mg2+ addition did not increase the cumulative H2 production. The H2 yield of sole L-cysteine addition was 1.53mol H2/mol glucose, indicating a considerable improvement as compared to the control: L-cysteine is an important nutrient for hydrogenase formation. The structural unit L-cysteine residue is a constituent part of [NiFe]hydrogenase and [FeFe]hydrogenase which is related to the active center. Besides, L-cysteine, as a reducing agent, has the ability to reduce the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) value in the fermentation system, which enhances the growth of some H2-producing bacteria [21], thus considerably increasing the cumulative H2 production. Another probable reason might be that L-cysteine also acts as a bioactive agent for fermentative hydrogen production, for it was reported to be a mediator between bacteria and substrate [22]. The cumulative H2 productions with the L-cysteine plus ions were lower than that with the sole L-cysteine addition, but still higher than the control one. The cumulative H2 productions with Fe2+ addition and Mg2+ addition were 1207mL and 1134mL in presence of L-cysteine, respectively. L-cysteine and the ion additions exhibited contrary effects, probably due to the fact that L-cysteine is chelating metal ions, thus making them largely unavailable and leading to the decrease in the hydrogen production [23]. The cumulative hydrogen data, depicted in Fig. 1, were fitted with the Gompertz equation and the determined constants are listed in Table 1 , where P is the maximum potential H2 production; Rm is the maximum H2 production rate; and λ is the duration of the lag phase. The Gompertz equation is defined as follows: H ( t ) = Pexp - exp R m e p ( λ - t ) + 1 As can be seen in Table 1, the order of the enhancement for the hydrogen production on the basis of the maximum potential H2 production, was Fe2+ > L-cysteine> L-cysteine+Fe2+ > L-cysteine+Mg2+. Compared with the control test, the cumulative H2 production and H2 yield were greatly increased. Unlike the cumulative H2 production and H2 yield, not all the H2 production rates were greatly improved, all being in the range of 4.5–19.1mLh−1. The highest Rm of 19.1mLh−1 was achieved by Fe2+ addition, while L-cysteine addition could only slightly increase Rm . Besides, it was found that Mg2+ could increase the H2 production rate whether L-cysteine exists in the medium or not, which was most likely attributed to the fact that magnesium ion plays a very crucial role of activator of many glycolytic enzymes, acting as cofactor of many kinases and synthetases involved in glycolysis process, such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase[24]. So magnesium ion has the ability to enhance glycolysis to generate more pyruvate and NADH, which will be further oxidated for hydrogen production. This was also the reason why Mg2+ addition could shorten the lag phase λ from 53h to 24h. The r 2 values of Gompertz fit were slightly low, (r 2 =0.90–0.99), and probably due to the untypical H2 production characteristics as a combination of starch hydrolysis, acidogenesis and hydrogenesis processes in the batch tests, where the starch hydrolysis and the resulting sugar fermentation took place simultaneously. Moreover, pH inhibition and substrate limitation are not taken into consideration in Gompertz equation. A more suitable model for H2 production with this mode of operation by additions still needs to be developed. The pH value seemed to have a negligible effect for different trace elements addition. However, there was a relationship between pH value and cumulative H2 production: H2 was generated only for pH<5.5. All the final pH values were around 3.4–4.0. Ruggeri et al. [25] reported that the H2 production rate decreased when pH reached 4.2–4.0 and completely stopped within a pH range of 3.2–4.0. The pH values in the range of 5.5–4.0 were favorable for H2 production in this study. Still lower pH values are not good for fermentative H2 production because the lower pH value resulting from the VFAs accumulation in the broth may repress the bioactivity of the bacteria. The hydrogenase activity was susceptible to the pH value. Since the pH range of 5.0–6.8 was suitable for hydrogenase, a lower pH would inhibit the hydrogenase activity and eventually lead to terminating the H2 production. According to the ADM1 model, the empirical lower pH inhibition term, I pH was defined as : (6) I pH = exp - 3 pH meas - pH UL pH UL - pH LL 2 where pHUL and pHLL denote the upper limit and the lower limit, respectively. In ADM1, the values of pHUL and pHLL are considered to be 5.5 and 4.0 for acidogenic bacteria [26]. When the pH reaches 4.0, the pH inhibition becomes remarkable because I pH is 0.05, which is close to 0. Liu et al. [27] assessed the effect of pH on fermentative biohydrogen production and found that the lowest hydrogen yield was observed at pH 4. The H2 yield was determined as the total H2 production per mole glucose fed and was 1.53mol H2/mol glucose fed, obtained with the sole L-cysteine addition, which slightly exceeded the literature result (1.29mol H2/mol glucose) [28]. The soluble metabolites distribution and H2 yield for the different test cases R1-R8 are summarized in Table 2 , with the major soluble metabolites being butyrate and acetate, whereas only a minor amount of ethanol was detected in the liquid phase during the whole fermentation time. The H2 production was mainly of a butyrate type fermentation rather than an ethanol type fermentation, where the butyrate percentages in the total soluble metabolites varied in the near-constant range of 59–67%, except in the case of sole Mg2+ addition. Butyrate and acetate favor H2 production, while a negative relationship between hydrogen yield and ethanol generation was observed. Karadag and Puhakka [26] reported that the increase in ethanol production was associated with the decrease in HPY (H2 production yield) in a glucose-fed ACSTR. The ethanol production with sole Fe2+ addition in R2 decreased by about 50%, when compared to that of the control (R1). This suggests that the ethanol production was inhibited by adding Fe2+ and L-cysteine, thus producing more VFAs and increasing the H2 yield, as also demonstrated by other researchers [29]. Moreover, in presence of L-cysteine, the H2 production process seems to be more smooth and steady."
9,effects of the pre-treatment on the H2 production,"3.2 effects of the pre-treatment on the H2 production The evolutions of the cumulative H2 production, H2 content and pH with time for control and substrate pre-treated tests are drawn in Fig. 2 . The average cumulative H2 production increased from 838mL to 1186mL by substrate pre-treatment. Moreover, the slope of the curve with substrate pre-treatment was far steeper than that of the control one, indicating that the H2 production rate was significantly improved by the substrate pre-treatment: the substrate pre-treatment contributed to the starch hydrolysis which is the limiting step in H2 production process so that the substrate was easier and faster utilized to produce H2. The fermentation ended within 120h when substrate pre-treatment was provided, which was only one-third to the fermentation time of the control, thus significantly faster. When a substrate pre-treatment is applied, the pH values were lower due to the effective starch hydrolysis and VFA formation. The H2 content tended to decrease with time from almost the same initial value of 64%, although it decreased sharply with substrate pre-treatment, while it exhibited a gentle decrease in the control test. This might be caused by the difference in pH value as well as by the ratio of the butyrate/acetate composition (B/A), which was related to the metabolic pathways. Lin [30] suggested that changes of H2 content affected the pH value in mixed cultures. It should be noticed that B/A ratio could mirror the pH value and H2 content. A high B/A ratio was in accordance with low pH value and low H2 content. The cumulative H2 production in Fig. 2 was also fitted by the Gompertz equation, and the constants are shown in Table 1. It demonstrates that the potential cumulative H2 production can be increased by 40% by substrate pre-treatment, and the lag time is shortened from 50h to 34h, implying that bacteria preferred the treated starch as substrate to produce H2. The maximum H2 production rate (Rm ) reached 28.0mLh−1 with substrate pre-treatment, which was 4.5 times that of the control (6.3mLh−1), and much higher than 14.14mLh−1 reported by Nath et al. [31]. The overall fit by the Gompertz equation was excellent (r 2 =0.99), implying that the Gompretz equation is adequate to model the cumulative H2 production with substrate pre-treatment. Metabolites distribution, butyrate content, B/A ratio and H2 yield for R7 and R8 were presented in Table 2. The soluble metabolites were still butyrate, acetate and ethanol and the butyrate content increased to 84%, suggesting that the fermentation was also of the butyrate type. The concentration of total soluble metabolites was 1.761g/L, lower than 1.868g/L of the control test. This was due to part of the carbon source being consumed for CO2 production. The H2 yield with substrate pre-treatment was 1.19mol H2/mol glucose fed, which was 40% higher than the control test. The butyrate to acetate ratio (B/A) calculated on a molar basis was used as a quantitative indicator of the H2 production and substrate metabolism [32]. Lee et al. [33] reported that the B/A ratios ranged from 1.1 to 6.7 in a MBR system and increased in proportion to the hydrogen production rate. A similar relationship between the H2 yield and the B/A ratio, where the B/A ratios were linearly proportional to the H2 yield, was found in Kim’s study [32]. Zhao et al. [34] demonstrated that the butyrate to acetate ratio was closely correlated with the hydrogen yield. This relationship was not found in the present study, but there was a relationship between B/A ratio and H2 content: the H2 content decreased from 58% to 53% when the B/A ratio increased from 2.00 to 4.83, suggesting that an increase in B/A ratio leads to a decrease in the H2 content. Theoretically, when the glucose was converted completely to acetate, the H2 content could reach 67%; at the same time, the H2 content was about 50% when butyrate was the only end product fermented from glucose. A high B/A ratio indicated that the butyrate production was dominant during H2 production, therefore the experimental H2 content obtained was close to the theoretical value of 50%. Profiles of cumulative H2 production, substrate degradation and glucose concentration as a function of time for R7 and R8 were illustrated in Fig. 3 . The glucose concentration fluctuated: during the first 16h, it increased rapidly to a peak value of 0.27g/L, afterwards it decreased and remained at a low level for the remaining fermentation time, which proved that the bacteria applied in this study did have the ability to hydrolyze the starch by amylase synthesized on its own. The glucose concentration with substrate pre-treatment exhibited a similar trend with the control test, of which the peak value (nearly 4.0g/L) was much greater than that of the control test. This demonstrated that substrate pre-treatment facilitated the hydrolysis of the starch by the bacteria so the substrate degradation was faster. Consequently, the faster substrate degradation resulted in the faster H2 production and the shorter fermentation time. With substrate pre-treatment, the pattern of the cumulative H2 production as well as the substrate degradation with time displayed a typical lag, exponential and stationary phases. In a sense, that might explain why the data with substrate pre-treatment could be well fitted with the Gompertz equation. Considering the fundamentals of acetate and butyrate formation from glucose in a fermentative H2 production process, the H2 productions based on the measured VFAs were calculated (Eq. 5), compared with the experimental values, and depicted in Fig. 4 . For the control test (R7), the experimental H2 productions matched the calculated H2 production based on VFAs during the primary period of the fermentation, whereafter, they were lower than those calculated based on VFAs. This might be caused by the high H2 partial pressure and the limited activity of reduced ferredoxin that catalyzed the reversible reaction of NADH+H+↔NAD+ +H2 by a [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase [5,8]. For substrate pre-treatment (R8), it showed that the experimental H2 productions were slightly higher than those based on VFAs, which was different from the control one. Considering the fermentative H2 production pathways, it was inferred that there might be another pathway to produce extra H2 without VFAs generation, like the formate dehydrogenation, of which the end product was principally ethanol [6]."
10,Conclusions,"The present study used mixed culture fermentation of corn starch and studied the effect of both starch pre-treatment and different additions on the H2 production. The results showed that Fe2+, Mg2+, and L-cysteine mainly acted on strain B1 which played a key role in hydrogen generation, and substrate pre-treatment principally contributed to strain A1 which was responsible for starch hydrolysis. The cumulative hydrogen production can be significantly improved by adding L-cysteine and/or Fe2+. The maximum cumulative H2 production of 1928mL and H2 yield of 1.94mol H2/mol glucose fed were obtained with the sole Fe2+ supplement, which was followed by the sole L-cysteine addition with a H2 yield of 1.53mol H2 /mol glucose fed. L-cysteine combined with ions exhibited a lower H2 production than the sole L-cysteine addition, but still higher than the control. The enhancement of the different treatments on the hydrogen production was Fe2+ > L-cysteine> L-cysteine+Fe2+ >L-cysteine+Mg2+, according to the maximum potential H2 production. Substrate pre-treatment accelerated the hydrogen production process and shortened the fermentation time. Moreover, B/A ratio increased from 2.00 to 4.83 when applying substrate pre-treatment. According to the metabolites distribution, the elements addition and substrate pre-treatment may result in a shift of metabolic pathways. The Gompertz equation fitted the cumulative H2 production with substrate pre-treatment very well, whereas it was not able to fit the data with elements addition. A more suitable model for H2 production still needs to be further developed. There was a relationship among H2 content, molar butyrate/acetate (B/A) ratio and pH value, where an increase in B/A ratio leads to the decrease in the H2 content and pH value."
