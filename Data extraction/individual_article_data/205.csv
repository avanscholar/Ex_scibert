0,Introduction,"The interest in exploring alternative processes for production of chemicals from renewable resources, such as fuels and plastics (for example, H2 and polyalkanoates), has been prompted by the imminent environmental crisis caused by global warming. Hydrogen is an optimum fuel since upon combustion generates only water and provides 2.75-fold higher energy (122 kJ/g) as compared to fossil fuels (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Unfortunately, only 5% of the total hydrogen production is used as a fuel owed to the lack of appropriate technologies to store it and transport it (Merugu et al., 2012). Regarding plastics, the replacement of oil-derived plastics with biodegradable plastics is urgently sought. For example, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) has similar characteristics to polypropylene with the great advantage that is biodegradable (Sacomboio et al., 2017). PHB is ideal for specialty applications such as the delivery and release of drugs, sutures, scaffolds for tissue engineering, nanoparticles for therapeutic treatments and cancer diagnostics, etc. (Ranaivoarisoa et al., 2019). Photofermentation with purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) from the genus Rhodopseudomonas is an attractive biological process for making high added value products such as H2 and PHB. Their integrated biological production could reduce their manufacturing cost. In fact, most reports suggest that the major expenditure contributor to the overall PHB production by fermentation is the cost of carbon substrate (Getachew and Woldesenbet, 2016) and PNSB can utilize a variety of organic compounds (carbohydrates and organic acids) (McKinlay et al, 2014; Shimizu et al., 2019), and agro-industrial effluents (Adessi and De Philippis, 2012). R. pseudopalustris DSM 123, a strain that is different from all the reported members of the Rhodopseudomonas genus (García-Sánchez et al., 2018), is particularly appealing for the simultaneous production of H2 and PHB. The use of ethanol as fuel is increasing, and consequently, the side streams from distillation (vinasses). Vinasses are generated in vast quantities and are highly polluting. In the case of spirits, for example, 1L of tequila results in 10-12L vinasses (López-López et al., 2010); in Mexico, 374 million L of tequila vinasses were produced in 2019 as byproduct of tequila manufacturing (CRT, 2020). This is a serious environmental problem because the majority tequila vinasses (TeV) are discharged without treatment to rivers and lakes. Tequila vinasses have been used for anaerobic digestion and dark fermentations (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2016). There are only a few reports of the production of H2 by PNSB from ethanol vinasses (Lazaro et al., 2015; García-Sánchez et al., 2018), and to the best of our knowledge there are no reports on the simultaneous production of H2 and PHB with Rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris (DSM 123) and TeV. This contribution analyzes the behavior of R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) for the simultaneous production of H2 and PHB using tequila vinasses supplemented with different nutrients."
1,Materials and methods,"The production of H2 and PHB with Rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris (DSM 123) was studied by the following strategy: first the effect of the concentration of acetate was assessed using a synthetic medium; then two cultivation media and the addition of nutrients to tequila vinasses were evaluated; afterwards the addition of Ar or N2 to the gaseous phase was compared with the same purpose, and finally, the concentration of phosphates was correlated for the production of both metabolites."
2,Microorganism and culture conditions,"2.1 Microorganism and culture conditions Conservation of Rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris (DSM 123) was carried out in the medium Rhodospirillaceae (RH), which consisted per liter: 0.3 g yeast extract, 1 g succinate sodium salt, 0.5 g ammonium acetate, 0.5 g KH2PO4, 0.4 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 g NaCl, 0.4 g NH4Cl, 0.05 g CaCl2·2H2O. The medium also contained per liter: 0.4 mL B12 vitamin (10 mg/100 mL water), 0.5 mL ethanol, 0.5 mL ferric citrate (0.1% in water) and 1 mL of trace elements solution. The composition of the trace elements solution was per liter: 0.1 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.03 g MnCl2·4H2O, 0.3 g H3BO3, 0.2 g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01 g CuCl2∙2H2O, 0.02 g NiCl2·6H2O and 0.03 g Na2MoO4∙2H2O; the pH was adjusted to 6.8 with NaOH 1 N. 60 mL of RH medium were placed in 120 mL serological bottles (tightly sealed with butyl-aluminum stoppers in order to keep anaerobic conditions) and sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C during 15 min. Then 6 mL of R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) culture was inoculated and the gaseous phase replaced with N2 and then incubated at 30 ± 2 °C during 48 h under active photosynthetic radiation at 200–300 µEm-2m-2s−1 measured with a universal light meter (Walz ULM-500)."
3,Evaluation of nutrients,"2.2 Evaluation of nutrients The inoculum, culture medium, culture conditions (30 ± 2 °C, N2, 200–300 µEm-2m-2s−1) used to evaluate the effect of nutrients on the production of hydrogen and PHB were prepared as described in section 2.1 for the subsequent fermentations. The cell concentration at the beginning of cultivation was adjusted to 3 g/L (dry basis) by optical density at 660 nm. Gaseous samples were taken in each run to determine H2 concentration and liquid samples to determine growth and PHB production every 24 h during 10 days (section 2.3). The gaseous atmosphere was replaced with N2 during 3 min every 24 h because it has been shown that in this manner the production of H2 is considerably increased (García-Sánchez et al., 2018). 2.2.1 Acetate concentration The effect of acetate over the production of H2 and PHB was evaluated by adding initially ammonium acetate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 or 5.0 g/L) to the medium RH under the experimental conditions described in section 2.2. Ethanol and sodium succinate were not added. 2.2.2 Effect of nutrients The culture media RH (section 2.1), CD, RHV, and CDV, were evaluated under the conditions described in section 2.1 and 2.2 (inoculum preparation, volume of culture medium, N2, light intensity, temperature, etc.). The medium identified as CD contained per liter (mg/L): 750 mg K2HPO4, 850 mg KH2PO4, 200 mg MgSO4, 11.80 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 2.80 mg H3BO3, 0.75 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.24 mg ZnSO4·7H2O, 2.10 mg MnSO4·4H2O, 0.04 mg CuCl2·2H2O, 0.75 mg CaCl2·2H2O, 2.00 mg EDTA-Na, 3.78 mg B1 vitamin, 3.60 mg biotin and 3.60 mg glutamate (Cardeña et al., 2017). Ammonium acetate was added (2 g/L) to both media, which had other carbon source. The culture media RHV and CDV were prepared with diluted tequila vinasses (at 2 g/L COD organic load as quantified by section 2.3) supplemented with the nutrients contained in the media RH and CD, respectively, excepting the carbon sources (ammonium acetate, ethanol and sodium succinate). 2.2.3 Ar or N2 Argon and nitrogen were evaluated for production of hydrogen and PHB by carrying out cultivations (see conditions in section 2.2.2) in the selected medium, the only difference was the replacement of the headspace of the cultures either with Ar or N2. 2.2.4 Addition of phosphates Fermentations were carried out in the selected medium as described in section 2.2.2. The concentration of K2HPO4 in the medium was adjusted to (g/L): 0.0, 0.1, 0.5 or 1.0. The concentration labeled as 0.0 g/L contained the phosphate already present in the tequila vinasses; the headspace was replaced with N2."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Biomass was determined both by dry weight and optical density (660 nm; Genesys 10S UV–Vis, Thermo Scientific). For biomass quantification by dry weight, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Centrifuge Eppendorf 5810 R) for 15 min, the precipitates washed twice with deionized H2O and dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The supernatant was utilized to determine sugar or organic acid content. Hydrogen was quantified by gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer Multisystem XL) with a Thermal Conductivity Detector at 100 °C by injecting 500 µL of gas sample in a column HayeSep D, 100/120 (Alltech), the oven set at 60 °C and the injector at 120 °C using N2 at 20 mL/min flow as carrier gas. The gas sample was collected from fermentation bottles over water using an upturned 100 mL measuring cylinder. The total volume was calculated by taking into account the displaced volume, plus the headspace. PHB was quantified as follows: 1 mL of cell culture was centrifuged (in this procedure centrifugation is at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant discarded), the precipitate was washed with DI water, centrifuged and then 1 mL sodium hypochlorite (1.8 wt%) was added to the precipitate and left for 1 h at 30 °C and centrifuged. The precipitate (PHB) was collected and the supernatant discarded. Then the sample was dehydrated with 1 mL ethanol (abs) and again centrifuged. 1 mL of acetone was added to the precipitate and then was vortexed and thereafter centrifuged. 1 mL sulfuric acid (98%) was added to PHB the temperature raised to 90 °C for 10 min, then left to cool down to ambient temperature and quantified by UV–vis at 235 nm (Thermo Scientific Genesys 10S UV/vis). Sulfuric acid was used as blank. A calibration curve was prepared with crotonic acid as standard in order to quantify PHB. Organic acids content was quantified by collecting the supernatant and after filtering through a membrane of pore size 0.45 mm, 20 μL were injected to an HPLC equipped with a diode array detector (2998 Waters) in an Alliance system (e2695), an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm mm, Biorad), the oven set to 50 °C and H2SO4 5 mM was used as the mobile phase at 0.6 mL/min. Calibration curves were prepared for succinic, lactic, formic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric and isovaleric acids. Quantification of carbohydrates and alcohols was carried out by injecting 20 µL of sample in a HPLC (Waters e2695) equipped a refractive index detector (Waters 2414) in an Alliance system (e2695), with a column Aminex HPX-87C (300 × 7.8 mm mm, Biorad), the oven set at 85 °C and water was used as the mobile phase at 0.6 mL/min. Calibration curves for glucose, fructose, ethanol and methanol were prepared in order to quantify the concentration of carbohydrates and alcohols. Total sugar content was measured by the method reported by Dubois et al. 1956, and reducing sugars were quantified by 3-amino-5-dinitrosalicilic acid (DNS) method. Total phenolic compounds were analyzed by the method described by Singleton et al., 1999. COD, total nitrogen and phosphorus, sulfates, chlorides, and potassium were determined with Hach kits. Fe, Na, NH4, Ca and Mg were quantified by ion chromatography, in an apparatus equipped with a pump (Dionex ICS-5000 + SP), conductivity detector (Dionex ICS-5000 + DC), and autoinjector (Dionex ICS-5000 + AS-AP). The system included a guard column (Dionex Ion Pac CG12A 4 × 50 mm) a column (Dionex Ion Pac CS12A 4 × 250 mm) and an ion suppressor (Dionex CERS 500 4 mm). The current applied was 59 mA, the eluent was methanesulfonic acid (20 mM) at 1 mL/min flow. The injected volume was 75 µL."
5,Kinetic parameters,"2.4 Kinetic parameters The maxima specific rates of growth (μmax, d-1) were calculated for each interval of time at the logarithmic phase; they are related to an “X” cellular concentration at a given time “t”. Hydrogen, biomass and PHB productivities (rH2, rX, rPHB) were obtained by taking the slope of the curve obtained by plotting the accumulated hydrogen, biomass or PHB versus time. Plotting the differences in biomass, H2 and PHB for each time period as a function of the difference of acetate (Ac) renders the yields YX/Ac, YH2/Ac and YPHB/Ac respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"It is well known that under phototrophic, anoxic and nitrogen limited conditions PNSB produce highly pure hydrogen. On the other hand, cells accumulate more PHB in alkali or under limited nutrient conditions. However, the production of H2 and PHB is specific for each PNSB strain (Cardeña et al., 2017; Adessi and De Philippis, 2014)."
7,Effect of acetate concentration on the production of hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate,"3.1 Effect of acetate concentration on the production of hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate Although the effect of specific acetate concentrations (from 10 to 60 mM) for hydrogen production has been amply studied on different PNSB species and strains, there are only a few reports on the effect of the concentration of acetate on the simultaneous production of PHB and H2 (Wu et al., 2012; Cardeña et al., 2017), and none for R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123). Fig. 1 depicts the profiles of growth of R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123), the production of hydrogen and PHB, and acetate utilization with different initial concentrations of acetate (Ac). It can be seen that for all treatments, the highest concentration of biomass (1.2 g biomass/L, Fig. 1-a) was achieved with 5 g Ac/L culture medium (CM). Apparently, as shown in Table 1 , by increasing the initial concentration of acetate the final biomass content is increased; the statistical analysis indicates that up to 6 days of fermentation the differences are not significant (P-value greater than 0.05). However, the longer the fermentation, the differences become significant as the biomass increased by twofold at day 10 comparing the lower concentration (0.5 g/L) to the higher concentration (5 g/L) of acetate. The specific growth rate maxima (µmax) are similar for all the concentrations of Ac tested. Fig. 1-a shows that after 10 days, the growth was unable to reach the stationary phase at acetate concentrations from 1.7 to 5 g Ac/L. Nonetheless, H2 and PHB have already reached their maxima before the end of the runs (10 days). Fig. 1-b shows that the production of H2 increased by increasing the concentration of Ac, and reached its maximum (200 mL/LCM) at a concentration of 3 g Ac/L at day seven. A similar production of H2 was obtained at 5 g/L Ac also at day 7. Indeed, there are significant differences (P-value < 0.05) in the production of H2 with different initial concentrations of Ac from 0.5 g/L to 3 g/L Ac; the concentrations of 3 and 5 g/L fell into the same homogeneous group (i.e no significant difference). The productivity (rH2, Table 1), behaved similarly to H2 production, but the yield of H2 with respect to the substrate (YH2/Ac, Table 1) was higher at 3 g/L of Ac as compared to the other treatments. This contribution can establish that R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) is able to produce a higher amount of H2 (200 mL/LCM) as compared to other reports. For example, Martínez-Merino et al. (2013) reported that Rhodopseudomonas sp. produced 25 mL H2/L with 1.5 g /L Ac; Rhodobacter capsulatus produced 45 mL H2/L with 1.8 g Ac/L, while Rhodobacter sphaeroides reached 90 mL H2/L with 2.1 g Ac/L. Moreover, the effect of varying the concentration of acetate (from 0.72 to 3.3 g/L) over the production of H2 was carried out with R. palustris P4; it was found that the higher production of H2 (approximately 25 mL H2 in 240 h) was obtained at 3.3 g Ac/L with no statistical differences on the production of H2 by increasing the concentration of Ac (Oh et al., 2004). The production of PHB was also increased by increasing the concentration of Ac up to 3.0 g/L (88.4 mg PHB/LCM, Fig. 1-c). Higher Ac concentrations decreased the production of PHB and the ANOVA showed significant differences (P-value < 0.05) on the production of PHB at different initial concentrations of Ac. It is worth noticing that the maximum production of PHB was reached at 48 h and thereafter decreased. This could be owed to the fact that once PHB accumulated, the reductive equivalents are recovered for production of H2 and bacteria use PHB for growth (Cardeña et al., 2017). Also, the productivity of PHB (rPHB) was higher when the concentration of Ac was 3 g/L, although the yield (YPHB/Ac) was higher at 1 g Ac/L (79 mg-PHB/g Ac). Interestingly, the productivity of PHB (103 mg-PHB/g biomass – day, obtained from 3 g Ac/L) obtained in this study was higher than the productivity obtained by Cardeña et al., (2017) at 16.4 mg-PHB/g–total suspended solids (TSS) – day, from 1.37 g Ac/L by R. palustris and other members of a consortium. The findings of this study are similar to the results reported by Sangkharak and Prasertsan (2007) for Rhodobacter sphaeroides, where the highest production of PHB was reached at Ac concentration 3.8–4 g/L. Fig. 1-d shows the substrate consumption profile at different concentrations. It is noteworthy that at 0.5 g/L, the acetate was completely consumed at day 8 (Fig. 1-d), while at higher acetate concentrations remnants can be observed, thereby suggesting substrate inhibition on growth, which can be observed by the decrease in the yield of conversion of acetate to biomass (YX/Ac, Table 1), owed to overflow metabolism characterized by incomplete consumption of substrate. Moreover, acid accumulation in the medium inhibits growth. Also, it is known that non-dissociated organic acids can penetrate the lipidic membrane of bacteria cells where can be dissociated at intracellular pH (7.5) which then decreases intracellular pH; moreover, energy is required to adjust the intracellular pH in anaerobic microorganisms (Corona-González et al., 2010; Pinhal et al., 2019). Inhibition by acetate and other organic acids is an important problem in different biotechnological processes because limits their utilization as substrates (Pinhal et al., 2019). Among the few reports on the simultaneous production of H2 and PHB, Wu et al. (2012) described that R. palustris WP3-5 produced 10% PHB dry cells at 48 h and 100 mL of H2 at 84 h from 0.48 g Ac/L; while Cardeña et al., (2017) showed that R. palustris WP3-5 produced the higher amount of PHB (4.8 mg-PHB/g TSS-day) and H2 (355 mL-H2/g TSS-day) with 3 g/L Ac, as compared to 1 g/L de Ac, similar to the results obtained in this study. These results indicate that the inhibitory concentration of Ac for production of H2 and PHB for R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) is 5 g Ac/L."
8,Comparison of culture media for production of hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate,"3.2 Comparison of culture media for production of hydrogen and polyhydroxybutyrate PNSB are able to produce H2 and/or PHB from industrial or agricultural residues such as food, sugar refineries and brewing side streams (Phongjarus et al., 2018), which contain monosaccharides, cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins, fats and proteins; other residues can contain also volatile fatty acids (VFA) (Kumar et al., 2019). TeV contain monosaccharides, VFA, alcohols, minerals, among others compounds, that significantly contribute to the organic load (Table 2 ), which is expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and can vary from 20 to 80 g/L (López-López et al., 2010). Recently, TeV have also been used for the production of H2 by photofermentation with R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) (García-Sánchez et al., 2018). Nonetheless, it is unknown its behavior during the simultaneous production of H2 and PHB with TeV supplemented with different nutrients. The bacteria were cultivated in two synthetic media (RH and CD), and two media with tequila vinasses (RHV and CDV). Fig. 2 shows the profiles for biomass, the production of H2 and PHB. It can be seen that the growth was similar with the different culture media, and that the stationary phase was unreached. The production of H2 with RH and CD media (Fig. 2-c) was significantly different (P value < 0.05), i.e. 50% higher in the CD medium as compared to RH. This might be explained by a higher concentration of PO4 in CD (Table 3 ), which favors the production of H2 (Oh et al., 2002). Furthermore, CD has 25-fold more molybdenum as compared to RH, and Mo is a cofactor of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for producing hydrogen (Adessi and De Philippis, 2012). The production of hydrogen was higher when TeV were used as substrate; RHV was 78% higher compared to RH, and CDV 24% higher compared to CD; however, there was no significant difference between RHV and CDV (P value < 0.05). The difference between the synthetic culture media and the media with TeV could be attributed to the nutrients that TeV contain such as carbohydrates, phenols, and a variety of VFA such as lactic, succinic, and valeric acids, as well as anions and cations necessary for cells (Table 2). Lactic acid is the main VFA (80% of the total acid content) in TeV and it has been reported that lactic acid produces more H2 in less time as compared acetate (Wu et al., 2012). Regarding PHB, the highest concentration was obtained with the synthetic media (RH and CD) at 48 h (day 2, Fig. 2-e). The accumulation of PHB was higher with the RH medium as compared to CD. With the media RHV and CDV the production of PHB was less than a half as compared to RH. Moreover, the concentration of PHB oscillated during growth due to its continuous consumption and production. This phenomenon could be the result of a low acetate concentration and carbon available to bacteria for the synthesis of PHB, because TeV have a lower VFA concentration (0.5 g/L) from which only 0.034 g/L are Ac, as compared to synthetic media, which have 2 g/L Ac. Some bacteria such as R. palustris WP3-5 can synthesize PHB only from acetate and propionate, and the efficiency of conversion of such acids is increased when the highest content of PHB is reached, attributable to competition between H2 and PHB for the reducing power once the synthesis of PHB has taken place (Wu et al., 2012). The difference on the production of hydrogen and PHB was no significant between the media RHV and CVD, and since the goal is to use TeV as substrate, the medium RHV was used in the following stages. As seen above, the results obtained in this contribution evidence the great potential of TeV for the production mainly of H2."
9,Argon and nitrogen,"3.3 Argon and nitrogen In order to investigate the effect of the type of gas in the headspace for production of both hydrogen and PHB by R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123), the gas phase was replaced with Ar or N2 in TeV cultures. Fig. 3 depicts the profiles of cell growth and production of H2 and PHB. Cell growth (Fig. 3-a) was 20% higher when the headspace was replaced with Ar as compared to N2 and at day 10 of cultivation, the stationary phase was unreached. In contrast, production of H2 was 35% higher (175 mL H2/L CM) when the cultures where carried out with N2 in 7 days of cultivation with a 1.8-fold productivity (rH2 = 25 mL H2/L-d) as compared to replacing the head space with Ar (i.e. 130 mL H2/L CM in 10 days and rH2 = 13.7 mL H2/L-d). Such behavior could be explained because PNSB’s photosynthetic system absorbs sunlight and carries out the transport of electrons that requires high amounts of ATP to fix N2 and produce H2 (Basak et al., 2014), resulting thus in a lower growth when N2 is in the system, since ATP is directed toward the production of H2 instead of towards growth. The preferred way to assimilate nitrogen is its fixation through nitrogenase via reduction of nitrogen to ammonia and releasing hydrogen as byproduct. However, the enzyme also works in absence of molecular nitrogen by using protons as electron acceptors in order to dissipate the excess of the cell’s reducing power (Adessi and De Philippis, 2012). Moreover, it has been shown that limiting N (NH4Cl) at a lower concentration of N, biomass is increased (Vincenzini et al., 1997). It has been reported for PNSB that in absence of nitrogen, nitrogenase is able to produce molecular hydrogen from protons in anaerobic conditions, a reaction that is associated with the consumption of ATP. Nitrogenase catalyzes the reaction for fixation of nitrogen using 16 ATP moles producing 1 mol of H2 and 2 mol of NH3. In the absence of nitrogen (for example Ar), all the electrons are assigned to the production of hydrogen using 4 mol of ATP and producing only hydrogen (Basak et al., 2014), thereby expecting a higher production of H2 with Ar. This finding should also be associated to the kind of strain utilized in this study. It is known that some Rhodopseudomonas species can grow in cultures rich in nitrogen and under a stream containing 95% N2, while other strains have lower growth under the same conditions (Howard et al., 1983). R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) has shown phenotypic and genotypic differences that include cell size, temperature range and pH optima, growth factor requirement and utilization of substrates. In contrast to other genus of Rhodopseudomonas is able to use formate and methanol. Therefore, R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) might have a different behavior on hydrogen production with respect to other strains of the genus (Venkata et al., 2012). It is worth to point out that reports on the use R. pseudopalustris (DSM 123) to produce H2 are scarce, and it is likely that this strain is more tolerant to high concentrations of NH4. On the other hand, production of PHB was 4-fold higher with Ar (81.9 mg PHB/L) in 2 days as compared to N2 (19.6 m PHBg/L) in 3 days. It can also be seen that the concentration of PHB with Ar was relatively constant during growth, meaning that PHB was not converted into H2, suggesting thus that N2 favors that the cell’s reducing power is transferred towards the production of H2 (Cardeña et al., 2017). There are only a few reports on the production of H2 and PHB with Rhodopsedomonas, particularly for PHB. To the best of our knowledge there are no reports comparing the effect of N2 and Ar on the behavior of both products."
10,Phosphate,"3.4 Phosphate The great majority of studies on microbial physiology and microbial metabolism have been carried out under excess of nutrients. In natural environments, however, microbes frequently lack critical nutrients for growth (McKinlay et al., 2014). PSNB synthesize and store PHB (through PHA synthase) as an intracellular reserve of carbon and energy under nutrient limitation (Cardeña et al., 2017). Therefore, it is of interest to study the effect of the addition of phosphate to the RHV culture medium (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 g/L K2HPO4) on the production of H2 and PHB. In general, culture media with R. palustris contain phosphate in the range of 0.15–9 g/L (Shi and Yu, 2004, Chen et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2013). Fig. 4 depicts the profiles for fermentation at different initial concentration of phosphate. Biomass was increased by increasing the concentration of phosphate, the highest 1.28 g biomass/LCM was reached at phosphate concentration of 1 g/L (i.e. 54% more biomass as compared to the growth without addition of K2HPO4, 0.83 g biomass/L CM). Such behavior could be attributed to the fact that the microorganism requires phosphate to synthesize the cell membrane, made up of phospholipids. R. pseudpalustris (DSM 123) has a lipidic profile that consists of diphosphatdylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine, unknown aminolipids, aminohopanoids and unknown phospholipids as main components (Venkata et al., 2012). Therefore, when the amount of lipids is insufficient, growth could be limited by phosphate deficiency. Similarly to growth, the production profile of H2 (Fig. 4-b) shows that at a higher phosphate concentration in the culture medium a higher production of H2 is obtained. Adding K2HPO4 at 1 g/L, a 2.6-fold H2 was reached as compared to the culture without K2HPO4 (267 mL H2/L vs 102 mL de H2/L CM). ANOVA indicates that there are significant differences on the production of H2 with different phosphate concentrations. It is likely that at phosphate concentrations greater than 1 g/L will increase also the production of H2. Oh et al. (2002) evaluated the effect of the concentration of phosphate in the range 10–300 mM (0.95–28.5 g/L PO4 -3) with R. palustris P4 and found that up to 50 mM (4.75 g/L PO4 -3) the production of H2 also increased; at higher phosphate concentration, H2 reached a constant volume of 37 mL. Opposed to H2, the higher concentration of PHB (Fig. 4-c) was obtained in the absence of K2HPO4 (305 mg PHB/L, in 6 days) and was 18 times higher as compared to the cultures with 1 g/L K2HPO4 (17.4 mg PHB/L, in 6 days). ANOVA shows that there are significant differences with the phosphate concentrations tested (P-value < 0.05) for production of PHB, suggesting thus that adding phosphate to tequila vinasses is not required for production of PHB. It is clear that limiting the concentration of PO4 -3 favors the production of PHB. In order to synthesize H2, nitrogenase catalyzes an endothermic reaction (which, requires external energy to surpass the positive barrier of free energy, i.e. ΔG0 = 75 kJ), with a high consumption of ATP. The stoichiometric balance indicates that 4 ATP molecules and 2 electrons are needed for each molecule of H2 produced (Adessi and De Philippis, 2014); PO4 -3 acts as precursor of ATP, favoring thus the production of H2. As PO4 -3 is limited in the culture medium, ATP formation are also constrained; the source of carbon is stored as PHB, leaving a part of PO4 -3 for synthesis of the biopolymer, since the membrane of the granule that contains PHB is constituted by phospholipids. The function of the covering of the phospholipid protein around the mass of PHB, presumably bare, is to reduce direct contact of PHB with water, avoiding the transition of the biopolymer from the liquid amorphous state to a more stable crystalline form. Also, it has been suggested that the phospholipid covering acts as a protecting barrier against cellular damages that could arise from interaction of PHB with cytosolic proteins (Prieto et al., 2007). Fig. 4-d shows the consumption of phosphate through the fermentations. It can be observed that at a lower initial phosphate concentration its consumption is faster and thorough. At phosphate concentrations of 306 and 702 mg/L, the consumption was incomplete, suggesting that these were in excess. On the other hand, phosphate concentration affected the consumption of lactic and formic acids already present in the vinasses (Fig. 4-e and 4-f); increasing phosphate concentration resulted in a faster consumption of lactic acid, while the concentration of formic acid was increased. The increased production of H2 and formate that resulted by increasing the initial concentration of phosphate could be associated to inactivation of hydrogenase. Hydrogenase are undesirable in production of H2 because induce the consumption of the gas, and some of them seem to couple the anaerobic oxidation of organic compounds with one carbon such as formate (Adessi and De Philippis, 2012), and when hydrogenase are inactive formate accumulates."
11,Conclusions,"This study has revealed the potential for production of H2 and PHB from tequila vinasses using R. pseudopalsutris (DSM 123). It is important to note that the conditions for production of PHB are different from those for production of H2 using tequila vinasses, as low phosphate concentration and the presence of Ar in the headspace favor the production of PHB, while high phosphate concentration and N2 in the headspace of the culture results in H2 as the main product. Consequently, future studies are focused on the production of H2 and PHB in cultures by steps, allowing to provide appropriate conditions for each product."
