0,Introduction,"In the present energetic scenario, renewable energy sources are not only strategic alternatives but are also becoming progressively mandatory. Among the options, hydrogen has been considered a promising carrier for different applications. Nowadays, steam reforming of hydrocarbons (mostly methane from natural gas) is still the main source of hydrogen at industrial scale [1], but the reforming of more complex, oxygenated molecules, such as bioethanol is becoming attractive [2,3]. The use of biomass derivatives, however, end up adding complexity to the reaction pathways and specific aspects in the catalyst design [4]. Among the oxygenated molecules that have been explored to produce hydrogen is glycerol, a byproduct from biodiesel production [5]. The glycerol steam reforming (GSR) reaction (Eq. (1)) involves two main reactions, the glycerol decomposition, producing H2 and CO (Eq. (2)), and the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (Eq. (3)), that produces additional H2 by the oxidation of CO to CO2 with steam [6]. According to these steps, the H2 selectivity from GSR reaction can be catalytic raised by favoring the WGS reaction [5]. (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O ⇌ 7 H 2 + 3 C O 2 Δ H = 128 k J m o l − 1 (2) C 3 H 8 O 3 ⇌ 3 CO + 4 H 2 Δ H = 251 k J m o l − 1 (3) C O + H 2 O ⇌ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H = − 41 k J m o l − 1 The GSR reaction has been reported under several conditions, mostly involving catalysts of Ni and Pt supported on oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, CeO2 and CeO2/ZrO2 [7–11]. Over the same support, Pt has been correlated to reduced methane formation when compared to Ni; moreover, the support has shown to be a determinant factor to favor H2 selectivity since it may participate in the WGS step [6,7,11,12]. Therefore, the design of high performance catalysts for H2 production from GSR reaction is a challenging task and many systems and additives have been explored. In this context, vanadium oxide is an effective promoter in several studies especially focused on the transformation of hydrocarbons to olefins, by dehydrogenation, or to COx and H2 through oxidation reactions [13–15]. For instance, when VOx/Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were applied to propane total oxidation, they showed higher catalytic activity compared to Pt/Al2O3 [16]. Moreover, when a WGS stage was integrated to ethanol oxidation, the V addition to the WGS Pt/CeO2 catalyst enhanced the activity [17]. The effect of vanadium as promoter on catalytic activity has demonstrated to be dependent on several factors. One of them is the support nature, as observed for methanol oxidation reaction to produce formaldehyde. Vining et al. [18] compared VOx grafted on SiO2 and CeO2/SiO2 and observed a remarkable increase in methanol conversion for the VOx/CeO2/SiO2 catalyst. Furthermore, the promoting effect of vanadium seems to rely on the VOx species formed over the support surface; Kilos et al. [19] showed that when tridimensional structures were created, they affected the accessibility of ethanol to the active sites of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, thus decreasing the turnover rates for ethanol oxidative dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. Moreover, the presence of vanadium in CeO2 catalysts has increased the stability towards Cl poisoning when applied to the combustion of chlorobenzene [20]. Thereby, the deposition of dispersed vanadium species over metal oxides can play an interesting role in glycerol decomposition, since these species are active for selective dehydrogenation of alcohols. In addition, VOx species have showed increased WGS activity when added to ZrO2 and CeO2 supported Pt catalysts through the increased reducibility of the support [21]. Hence, in this work the impact of vanadium loading in VOx-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts applied to WGS and GSR has been evaluated, showing that while the WGS step was favored with vanadium addition, the selectivity to H2 in GSR reaction decreased, suggesting the competitive role of the acid and redox nature of vanadium sites."
1,Experimental details,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The chemicals were used as received, without any pre-treatment. The support γ-Al2O3 was synthetized by the sol-gel method previously described [22]. Briefly, aluminium tri-sec buthylate (Merck, 97%) was stirred with ethanol and water at 80°C for 1h, then a certain amount of 0.1molL−1 HNO3 solution was added and the system was kept under reflux for 14h. The formed gel was dried at 110°C overnight and calcined under synthetic air flow at 500°C, 4h. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (1% wt) was synthetized by wet impregnation. One gram of the γ-Al2O3 support was added to an ethanolic solution containing 0.025g of H2PtCl6·H2O (Umicore, 40% Pt basis) and the dispersion was stirred in a rotary evaporator for 4h. The ethanol was evaporated in vacuum; the solid was dried at 110°C overnight and then calcined again under synthetic air flow at 500°C, 4h. The catalyst was labeled PtAl. The VOx-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of PtAl by adding 41, 82 and 163mg of NH4VO3 (Aldrich, >99%) dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water, to result in three catalysts with different loadings of vanadium (1.8, 2.5 and 6.6% V wt/gcat, respectively). After stirring and solvent evaporation, the solids were dried and calcined as before. The final catalysts were labeled 05VPtAl, 1VPtAl and 2VPtAl, and generally addressed as xVPtAl. For comparison, a 1VAl sample was prepared in similar way without adding the Pt precursor."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured in a Shimadzu XRD7000 equipped with Cu target (Kα=1.5406Å), operating at 40kV and 30mA. Vanadium and platinum loadings were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in a Shimadzu XRF1800. The surface area of the PtAl catalyst was obtained by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method in a Quantachrome Nova 4200 by N2 adsorption at – 196°C, after pre-treatment at 150°C by 24h. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR-H2) was conducted in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 equipped with a U-tube reactor. Thirty mg of catalyst were treated under N2 flow for 30min at 200°C, cooled to room temperature and heated to 1000°C, at 10°Cmin−1 under 30mLmin−1 of 10% H2/He. The H2 consumption was quantified by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector and a calibration curve. The signal obtained for the bare alumina support was subtracted prior the analysis. In situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra at V K-edge (5465eV) and Pt L3-edge (11564eV) were obtained at XAFS2 beamline at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), Campinas, Brazil. The samples packed in pellets were mounted in a home-made furnace connected to a gas flow system, working in transmission mode. Catalyst activation was conducted under 2.5% H2/He flow, 100mLmin−1 and the WGS reaction was conducted using CO:H2O vol. ratio of 1:3 and total flow of 100mLmin−1. To help the identification of the intermediate V species, bulk V2O5 reduction was conducted and the X ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data was analyzed by the methodology described by Wong et al. [23]. Briefly, the spectra obtained at selected temperatures were compared to V references compounds. After attributing the selected spectra to a known vanadium oxide phase (V2O5, V4O7, V2O4, V2O3 and VO), the identification of V species in the xVPtAl catalysts was done. X ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at Pt L3-edge were used to estimate the Pt metallic dispersion, through the analysis of the coordination numbers obtained for the first nearest neighbors of Pt, assuming a spherical nanoparticle model. The XAFS data was analyzed using Demeter software package [24]. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible range (UV–vis DRS) was performed using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis- NIR spectrophotometer. The catalyst was finely ground and the absorbance was measured in the 200–800nm range at ambient conditions. All spectra were obtained with hydrated samples and the reference compound was BaSO4. The Kubelka-Munk function, F(R∞), was obtained from the absorbance."
4,Catalytic activity,"2.3 Catalytic activity WGS reaction tests were performed in a fixed bed quartz reactor (i.d. 9mm) operating at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (75mg) was diluted in 125mg of ground quartz and reduced in situ at 500°C, 10°Cmin−1 for 1h in 35mLmin−1 of H2. The catalyst was cooled at 250°C and the WGS reaction was performed with 1:3 CO:H2O (v/v) feed ratio and total flow of 100mLmin−1. The CO conversion (%) was followed by gas chromatography in an Agilent CG 7890 equipped with a TCD detector, at temperatures of 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450°C, with 5 measurements at each temperature. The CO conversion was obtained by % COconv =[CO2/(CO+CO2)]×100. The specific rates were estimated by r=FCO (mol s−1)×% COconv ×MM (gmol−1)/(100×mcatalyst (g)×tm×D), where FCO CO molar flux; MM=Pt molecular mass; tm=metal loading and D=metal dispersion (estimated by EXAFS data). GSR reaction was performed in the same catalytic unit using 100mg of catalyst and 400mg of diluent. The catalytic test was performed at 400°C for 2h, with in situ reduction of the catalyst at 500°C for 1h under H2. A glycerol aqueous solution (3.3molL−1) was fed into the reactor by a Cole Parmer 74900 syringe pump (at a rate of 1.9mLh−1) and vaporized before reaching the catalyst bed, using He as carrier gas (30mLmin−1). The total liquid fraction was collected in a condenser flask and the gaseous products H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were analyzed by an Agilent GC7890A gas chromatograph, using a TCD and He as carrier gas. Glycerol total conversion was obtained by detection of unreacted glycerol in the liquid fraction in an Agilent GC7890A using a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). The liquid components were identified by an Agilent GC7890A using a mass spectrometer detector quadrupole 5978C inert XL NSD Agilent."
5,Results and discussion,"The diffraction profiles of the catalysts and the bare γ-Al2O3 support are shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction pattern of PtAl catalyst is similar to the γ-Al2O3 support and the absence of peaks corresponding to crystalline phases of Pt and/or PtO2 indicates that the metallic phase is well dispersed over the alumina surface. For the xVPtAl catalysts, an increase in the diffracted intensity can be seen below 2θ–30°. In fact, for the V2O5 standard, the three main peaks are found at 2θ equal to 20.28°, 26.15° and 31.01° and correspond to the (001), (110) and (031) reflections of the α-phase, respectively (PDF 041-146). Therefore, the observed slight increase in the intensity of the signal at this 2θ region for the xVPtAl catalysts suggests the absence of a highly ordered V2O5 phase. Table 1 shows the the Pt and V wt% obtained by XRF. Considering these values and the specific surface area obtained for the PtAl catalyst (BET 300m2/g), it was possible to estimate the vanadium surface coverage (V atoms per nm2) for each catalyst (Table 1). At these loadings, below 2Vnm−2 , the formation of V2O5 nanoparticles, not detected by XRD, was indeed not expected [25–28]. For example, Carrero et al. [29] found that V2O5 nanoparticles were formed when using ammonium metavanadate as precursor for coverages of 6.1Vnm−2 and greater, which is about three times higher than the maximum V loading of our samples. For other precursors the threshold was even higher (V loading necessary to form a monolayer over alumina was about 8Vnm−2). Similar results were found by Wu et al. [26] that detected that crystalline V2O5 becomes the dominant species only at much higher coverage, i.e., 14.2Vnm−2, although it started to be formed at coverages of 4.4Vnm−2. The absence of nanocrystalline V2O5 nanoparticles in our samples indicated by XRD were also confirmed by visible Raman spectroscopy (not shown) that did not present the characteristic intense band around 994cm−1 of the crystalline V2O5 phase [15,21,26,29]. One of the interesting and challenging aspects of vanadium is that it presents a variety of oxidation states and oxide structures. When dealing with vanadium oxides dispersed on alumina, it has been shown that the main species depend on the V loading [26–28]. At low loadings, these species can be monomeric, having VO bonds with the support, and polymeric, with bridging VOV bonds, as depicted in Fig. 2 . It is also important to consider the existence of hydroxyl species due to hydrated conditions [27]. Nevertheless, the loading range that dictates the prevalence of one or another structure and which one would render the support a higher reducibility depend on several factors, such as the vanadium precursor [29] and the oxide support. For instance, according to Nguyen-Thanh et al. [21] the predominant species over ZrO2 at low V loadings (up to 2.8nm−2) are monomeric VOx (having at least one VOZr bond with the support). At higher loadings, the amount of these isolated species increases to the limit in which the formation of polymeric VOx and a monolayer are favored, which possess more VOV bridging bonds, therefore interacting less with the support. The authors then correlated the high concentration of monomeric units to the increase in the support reducibility, which in turn was attributed as the main factor to the enhanced catalytic activity observed for WGS reaction in Pt-VOx/ZrO2 catalysts. In contrast, Wu et al. [25,26] investigated the surface of Al2O3 after impregnation with vanadium and suggested that the presence of dispersed polymeric units rendered facilitated reducibility in comparison with the monomeric ones. This observation was in agreement with the work by Ballarini et al. [28] in samples containing about 2% wt of V2O5 impregnated over γ-Al2O3 (0.7Vnm−2), which reported the reduction of isolated VOx species at higher temperatures. Samples with higher V loadings (7 and 10% wt) presented predominance of polymeric species and bulk vanadium oxide that reduced at lower temperatures. To compare the samples concerning the geometric and electronic structure of vanadium over xVPtAl catalysts, XANES spectra of the fresh samples (as-prepared) were collected at V K- and Pt L3-edges and are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. Fig. 3a shows that at room temperature all xVPtAl catalysts, in average, are composed by similar species in respect to their electronic and geometric nature. It is also evident that the dominant species are not similar to bulk V2O5, although the presence of the pronounced pre-edge peak around 5470eV is consistent with a similar local environment, with V5+ species in a non-centrosymmetric coordination with oxygen atoms [23]. The XANES data is in accordance to the works by Tanaka et al. [30] and Ruitenbeek et al. [31], who identified V species impregnated over alumina as VO4 units having V5+ ions in distorted tetrahedral coordination, as illustrated in Fig. 2. These results are also in agreement with the absence of V2O5 crystalline phase on the surface of the catalysts. In the case of Pt, the XANES spectra for all catalyst (Fig. 3b) indicate the presence of oxidized Pt species; however, the spectra do not match the PtO2 standard indicating the formation of a highly dispersed PtOx phase. To gain more insights about the evolution of VOx species as a function of V loading, the samples were analyzed by UV–vis DRS and the profiles are shown in Fig. 4 . It is worth to point out that the 1VPtAl and 2VPtAl samples may have sufficient V to present polymeric VOx species, following the work of Nguyen-Thanh et al. [21] and Ballarini et al. [28]. According to several authors [26,32,33], the absorption bands of the UV–vis DRS spectra around 240nm can be assigned to monomeric species of vanadium, while the bands at higher wavelengths (near 300–400nm) would be related to polymeric VOx. Crystalline V2O5 would present a broad absorption extending to longer wavelengths (> 450nm). A more quantitative analysis based on the linear relationship between the energy edge determined by UV–vis DRS and the number of VOV bonds found in polymeric species was proposed [34]. In our xVPtAl catalysts, the absorption bands are broad and due to the presence of Pt a quantitative evaluation is difficult. Nevertheless, it seems a consensus that the bands at longer wavelengths can be attributed to polymeric entities (onceV2O5 NPs are excluded) and as a consequence, Fig. 4 indicates that the amount of polymeric species seems to increase as a function of the loading (especially by observing the shift to higher wavelengths from 05VPtAl to 2VPtAl and the raise in the signal around 330 and 400nm). These results are in accordance with previous works on bare alumina up to the monolayer coverage [26,34,35]. So far, the fresh catalysts were characterized and they are composed of dispersed PtOx and monomeric and polymeric VOx species over the surface, with the latter probably increasing with V loading. Nevertheless, prior the reaction the catalysts were activated under H2 up to 500°C for 1h and Fig. 5 shows the modification of the catalyst during TPR-H2. The reduction profiles provide information about the reducibility of species as well as indirect information about the interaction between the components of the catalysts (V-Pt). Due to the small Pt loading (0.5% wt), the H2 consumption corresponding to PtOx reduction could not be detected in the PtAl catalyst, in agreement with the work by Garcia et al. [32]. On the other hand, clear H2 consumption is observed for all xVPtAl catalysts and the 1VAl support (prepared in a similar way to 1VPtAl but without Pt), indicating that the reduction of the VOx species could be detected. The inset in Fig. 5 shows the reduction profile of bulk V2O5, which exhibits a broad peak centered at about 670°C [26]. No H2 consumption at higher temperatures was found for all catalysts, which further corroborates the absence of a crystalline V2O5 phase. Comparing to the 1VAl support, the H2 consumption peak shifts the center to about 500°C, indicating that VOx species dispersed on the alumina surface are reduced more easily than bulk V2O5, in accordance with the literature [26,28,35]. Comparing the 1VAl support and 1VPtAl catalyst, it is clear that the presence of Pt shifts further the reduction towards lower temperatures (around 300°C). This effect has been associated to H2 spillover promoted by Pt over VOx species [32,36], suggesting some degree of Pt-V interaction. By comparing 1VPtAl with 05VPtAl and 2VPtAl catalysts, the H2 consumption is in line with the V loading increase. The similar reduction profiles of 1VPtAl and 2VPtAl suggest the predominance of similar VOx species, in agreement with the DRS UV–vis and V K-edge XANES data. Therefore, the TPR-H2 profiles indicate that the interaction with alumina and the presence of Pt facilitate the reducibility of the VOx species independently of the vanadium content, as also observed by Zheng et al. [37]. This property has been pointed out as an important factor in catalytic processes such as propane total oxidation [32] and WGS reaction [38]. The support reducibility can induce the formation of active OH species and/or promote their mobility over the catalyst surface [21], which are important steps in the WGS and steam reforming mechanisms [6,38]. As an attempt to clarify the catalysts changes during the reduction process, in situ XANES experiments at Pt L3- and V K-edges were performed. In the case of Pt, the results show the evolution of PtOx species to metallic Pt, as evidenced in Fig. 6 . The analysis of the EXAFS data are shown in Table 2 and indicates that xVPtAl samples undergo a decrease in Pt dispersion compared to PtAl, which was possibly caused by the additional calcination performed after vanadium impregnation. In the case of V K-edge, the analysis is more complex. Wong et al. [23] analyzed the main oxide phases and several other compounds with known structure and coordination. Among the most important vanadium oxide structures are V2O5, V2O4, V4O7, V2O3 and VO; their V oxidation states varies from +5 to +2 and their coordination evolves from distorted square pyramid (V2O5) to distorted octahedral and finally to regular octahedral (VO). For a better comparison of the samples, the authors took the zero of energy with respect to the first maxima of the first derivative of V reference foil spectra (at 5465.0eV) and the position of all peaks was then given respective to this energy. To support the analysis of the catalysts, we first performed the in situ reduction of bulk V2O5 and followed the changes of V K-edge spectra. In this way, the position of the features of the selected spectra measured here was compared to the data published by Wong et al. [23] and the intermediate vanadium oxides formed on the catalysts during reduction were assigned. Fig. 7 a presents the results for bulk V2O5 under TPR-H2. The intense pre-edge peak at 5470.0eV in V2O5 spectra (spectrum taken at room temperature) is characteristic of a non-symmetric local coordination, as in the distorted square pyramid, and correspond to the dipole-forbidden 1s→3d transition that becomes partially allowed due to the mixing of 3d-4p metal orbitals and overlap from V 3d orbitals with O 2p [23]. When the structure evolves from V2O5 to VO (regular octahedral) the symmetry increases and therefore the pre-edge peak decreases. The decrease in the V oxidation state from +5 to +2 also shifts the absorption edge to lower energies. Therefore, by heating under H2 the V K-edge XANES spectra evolves (Fig. 7a), with a progressive decrease in the pre-edge peak intensity and energy and a rise of the white line intensity. The corresponding assignments of the intermediate vanadium oxides are shown in Fig. 7b. Accordingly, at 512°C the structure of V2O4 is formed, with V4+ in distorted octahedral coordination. At 602°C the V4O7 phase can be identified, with V3+ and V4+ ions in distorted octahedral coordination. Finally, at 650°C the spectra is similar to the one attributed to V2O3. Comparing to conventional TPR-H2 (inset, Fig. 5) for bulk V2O5, the H2 consumption up to 650°C can be associated to the reduction of V2O5 to V2O3, which is probably reduced further to VO up to 800°C. After the successful assignment of the intermediary vanadium oxides formed during bulk V2O5 reduction, xVPtAl catalysts were also investigated by in situ XANES at V K-edge. The corresponding spectra obtained at selected temperatures are shown in Fig. 8 . Comparing the samples under reduction, above 400°C all three catalyst have similar profiles that did not change at 500°C. The main reduction of vanadium species up to 400°C was in accordance with conventional TPR-H2 results (Fig. 5), which showed no H2 consumption above this temperature for xVPtAl samples. The similarities of the spectra at 500°C for the three catalysts and V4O7 and V2O3 bulk phases suggest the presence of V3+ and V4+ ions coordinated in a more centrosymmetric configuration, consistent with distorted VO6 species. The small discrepancies with the bulk phases are likely originated by the dispersed nature of the species in the catalysts [23,31]. The presence of mixed valence (V3+ and V4+) species after reduction in H2 was also found by Wu et al. [25] on VOx/Al2O3 samples. Therefore, the results suggest that all three xVPtAl samples after reduction, including 05VPtAl, present mixed valence (V3+ and V4+) VOx species on the surface that would be the species available for the reaction after catalysts activation. Fig. 9 shows the performance of the catalysts for the WGS reaction and it became evident that the presence of VOx species significantly increases the CO conversion in comparison with PtAl catalyst, especially above 300°C. Table 3 shows the specific rate obtained at 250 and 300°C. Interestingly, a clear correlation with V loading was not found. The fivefold increase in the specific rate at both temperatures for xVPtAl catalysts compared to PtAl evidences the promoting effect of vanadium; however, the results suggest that the enhancement was not significantly affected by the V loading. Based on the previous results, the nature of VOx species over the surface of the catalysts may be very similar in spite of the increased V content. To understand the nature of V and Pt species under WGS reaction conditions, in situ XANES at V-K and Pt-L3 edges were measured. The results for 1VPtAl catalysts are shown in Fig. 10 ; the other ones (not shown) have similar profiles. The behavior of Pt and V species were not altered under WGS conditions, while Pt was in metallic form as after the reduction step, the vanadium remained in mixed V3+/V4+ oxidation state in a distorted octahedral coordination. In the light of these results, consideration about the WGS reaction mechanism is useful to shed light in the promoting effect of VOx species in this set of catalysts. Over bifunctional catalysts, there is a consensus that the dominant mechanism depends on the catalyst nature and reaction conditions, and there are several proposals in literature [38]. In systems composed of a noble metal (Pt) supported in a non-reducible oxide such as Al2O3 it is generally accepted that the WGS reaction proceeds by the associative mechanism, in which CO would adsorb on Pt while H2O would be activated on the support, forming H and OH species. These species would react with adsorbed CO and then produce intermediates such as formates, carbonates and bicarbonates, that would decompose to form CO2 and H2. The correct assignment of the sites in which the formation of these intermediates would occur and how it would happen (migration of OH species to the metal or of CO to the support, or yet to the interface) remains a challenge [39]. The importance of the support has also been extensively reported in WGS reaction studies and in the presence of reducible oxides such as CeO2, TiO2, Co3O4, the “redox” mechanism, involving the participation of oxygen from the support becomes favored [40]. This process would provoke the reduction of the support and the formation of an oxygen vacancy which would be regenerated with the adsorption and dissociation of a water molecule preferentially on these sites, therefore forming H2 [39]. Hence, the increase in the CO conversion of the xVPtAl samples when compared to the unpromoted PtAl catalyst can be thought considering the important role of the support in the WGS reaction mechanism. The addition of other oxides in Pt-based catalysts can modify the catalytic activity in several ways, such as by improving the dispersion and stabilization of the metal phase over the surface of the support, changing the reducibility of the support, altering the electronic state of metal phase, by creation of new active sites at the metal-support interface, among others [15,41,42]. Accordingly, the results presented in this work indicate that the enhanced catalytic activity observed for V promoted catalysts may be associated to the increase in the reducibility of the support and/or the creation of more active interface sites. The presence of polymeric VOx could lead to the formation of a higher amount of OH species on the catalyst surface, compared to PtAl, and these species would react to produce the intermediates as formate [36]. It has been proposed that the polymeric moieties could also increase the mobility of these OH species through the support, favoring the reaction [21]. It is interesting to note, however, that the lack of correlation with V content, suggests that the further addition of V in 1VPtAl and 2VPtAl creates additional VOx species that do not significantly participate in the reaction. This behavior is different from the one found for model Pt/Al2O3 catalysts promoted with cerium, where a correlation with CeO2 loading was found [42] suggesting that an increase in the promoter content increases the probability of forming metal-oxide interfacial sites. In the case of vanadium, however, the interaction with alumina and the tendency to form polymeric species spread on its surface [43] might frustrate the odds to form new Pt-VOx interfacial sites with increasing loading. It is interesting to note that in the 2VPtAl there are 30 times more V atoms than Pt ones. The importance of interfacial sites has been demonstrated in other systems. For example, Sener et al. [44], applying controlled surface reactions to produce Pt/Mo bimetallic catalysts, reported that the turnover frequency for WGS reaction exhibited a linear correlation with the amount of MoOx species in close contact with Pt metallic sites. The authors then suggested that the interfacial Pt-Mo sites would be the active ones for the reaction, and the MoOx promoter would have the role to stabilize water and/or OH groups, thus increasing their coverages, facilitating the reaction. DFT (density functional theory) has also helped to highlight the important role played by the Pt-metal oxide interfacial sites, revealing a complex framework depending on the system [45]. In this sense, for the xVPtAl catalysts the interfacial Pt-VOx sites may be the responsible for the 5-fold enhancement of the activity for WGS reaction compared to the PtAl catalyst. Considering the positive impact of vanadium in the WGS reaction, the catalysts were tested for the GSR reaction, aiming to maximize H2 production through the WGS step. Fig. 11 shows the gaseous products distribution (CO2, H2, CH4 and CO) obtained under GSR reaction. The results showed that for all samples the major gaseous products were CO and H2, followed by CO2 and a small fraction of CH4. The product distribution was consistent with glycerol decomposition reaction (Eq. (2)); however, the presence of CO2 indicated that WGS reaction (Eq. (3)) was also occurring. The CO2 fraction was higher for the xVPtAl catalysts and increased with the V loading, in agreement with the presence of VOx species favoring the WGS reaction. However, an opposite behavior for H2 was found; the xVPtAl catalysts showed lower H2 fraction compared to PtAl. This suggests that the H2 produced by WGS reaction may have been consumed by parallel reactions. According to Pompeo et al. [8], Pt-Al2O3 catalysts in GSR reaction favor the dehydration pathway of glycerol molecule, due to the acid nature of alumina, forming CH4 and CO2, by the following overall reaction: (4) C 3 H 8 O 3 → C O 2 + CO + C H 4 + 2 H 2 The authors reported that this reaction would proceed alongside the decomposition reaction (Eq. (2)), leading to the additional formation of CO and H2. Taking this reaction into account and the formation of the small amount of CH4, it is suggested that this step may occur as a minor route. Moreover, the higher fraction of CH4 and the reduced amount of H2 for xVPtAl suggest that parallel reactions are enhanced by the vanadium presence. The total liquid fraction of the products, collected at the end of the reactions, indicated no residual glycerol within the range of the calibration curve (up to 95%), showing that the reaction conditions led to total conversion of glycerol. The major products detected in the liquid fraction for all catalysts were ethanol, 2-propenal (acroleyn), 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, propanal and phenol, which strongly evidences the presence of glycerol dehydration reactions in acid sites of the support (Al2O3 and VOx/Al2O3) [8,46]. In fact, it has been reported the increase in support acidity with the addition of VOx species over Al2O3 within monolayer coverage regime [35]. Furthermore, the lower selectivity for H2 observed for xVPtAl catalysts are consistent with the reported activity of vanadium catalysts for the dehydration reactions of acetaldehyde and glycerol [27,47], that would be promoted by the acid sites of VOx, therefore leading to the formation of the aforementioned byproducts. In summary, although the V promoted catalysts exhibited higher CO conversions in WGS reaction when compared to PtAl sample, under GSR the presence of vanadium seems to favor the formation of byproducts, decreasing the fraction of H2, likely due to the acidic nature of VOx species."
6,Conclusions,"Vanadium oxides are interesting and challenging structures to apply in catalysis and their addition on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts illustrated the powerful tuning of the catalysts properties, as observed by their performance on WGS reaction. The promoted samples showed a five-fold increase in the WGS activity when compared to PtAl, therefore demonstrating the success of this approach. However, the increase of V content did not clearly impact in the WGS activity, which might be related to the formation of polymeric VOx species interacting with alumina surface instead of new interfacial Pt-VOx sites that would favor the reaction. The in situ characterization of the catalysts showed that metallic Pt and V3+/V4+ species are present during WGS reaction regardless of V loading. When applied to GSR reaction, the presence of VOx species favored the WGS step; however, the H2 fraction did not increased as expected, probably due to its consumption in parallel reactions and/or due to the acidic nature of VOx species over the surface that would lead to the formation of byproducts. Therefore, the overall result for both reactions reinforces the necessity of finding the right tuning of several aspects to optimize the catalyst activity and selectivity."
