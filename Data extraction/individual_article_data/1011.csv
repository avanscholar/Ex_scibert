0,Introduction,"Power-to-gas and power-to-liquid technologies via CO2 conversion might be part of the solution to reduce CO2 emissions, creating a closed utilisation loop while boosting renewable energy penetration in the present electrical system. In fact, gas and liquid fuels obtained from renewable energy sources (RES) and CO2 re-use couples the benefits of both clean energy sources and fossil fuels: on the one hand, clean energy and low CO2 impact typical of wind, solar, hydro and other RES, while on the other hand, the high density and reliability typical of fossil fuels without huge CO2 emissions [1]. The production of renewable fuels from solid oxide cells (SOC) fed with RES electricity and captured CO2 will be more expensive than fossil fuel, but cheaper than biofuels [2]. Numerous authors analysed the production chain in different power-to-liquids (PtL) plants for storing electricity into liquid fuels. The main studies are reported in Table 1 . Among the renewable fuels, methanol presents some peculiar characteristics. It is a well-known chemical compound that has increased its importance worldwide as a hydrogen carrier, as a fuel [12,13] and, more generally, as a multiuse chemical and energy feedstock [14] in the last few decades, even leading to the prospect of a future methanol economy [15–17]. In fact, methanol can be easily used, transported and stored without great changes in existing infrastructures (vehicle engines, fuel transport and distribution system). On the contrary, switching to a hydrogen economy with the mass production and utilisation of pure hydrogen would lead to a revolution in the fuel infrastructure [15]. Methanol results in a very interesting energy storage medium, as it is a high energy density carrier, both by weight and volume, and does not require high pressure storage, since its boiling temperature at ambient pressure is about 65 °C. Worldwide, the global methanol demand in 2015 was around 70 million tons. About 40% of this demand was attributed to energy applications [18]. Typically, methanol is produced from fossil fuels through methane steam-reforming or coal gasification [19], but can also be produced by means of other innovative processes such as catalytic CO2 hydrogenation [19]. Following the increase in climate change concern due to CO2 emissions, developing innovative systems for the production and utilisation of renewable methanol, for example methanol produced from RES and recycled CO2, is an interesting option to reduce the environmental impact due to the consumption of fossil fuels in energy, transport and industrial sectors. In fact, methanol is commonly used as a feedstock for petrochemicals (formaldehyde, acetic acid, propylene, ethylene etc.), for heat or steam generation, in both marine and ground transport sector [20] and for power generation in gas turbines or fuel cells. On the other hand, due to the progressive increase of RES exploitation, a massive contribution of energy storage is fundamental to increase the overall penetration, usability and dispatchability of RES. In this context, methanol as an energy carrier might help to solve the main issues related to renewable sources, improving their reliability and reducing the impact of intermittency and variability [21]. Also, coupling methanol production plants to conventional power plants will reduce the fluctuation seen due to the penetration of RES, smoothing the load profile and increasing the overall efficiency of the entire electric grid, thereby boosting the convenience of RES utilisation [22]. Moreover, in comparison to other energy carriers, such as the syngas produced following the power-to-gas routes, the power-to-methanol (the conversion of hydrogen to methanol and derived compounds, as for example, dimethyl ether, DME, methyl tert-butyl ether, MTBE and oxymethylene ether, OME) provides a more profitable way to convert electric energy [21]. While methanol from fossil fuels is currently based on centralised production and transport, a power-to-methanol approach would be decentralised with small to medium scale plants (with a foreseen production in the range of 50–100 kt/y). Currently, the largest demonstration power-to-methanol plant based on alkaline electrolysis, RES and captured CO2 is operating in Iceland (Carbon Recycling International George Olah Plant), with a production of about 4000 t/y and 5500 t/y of captured CO2 [23,24]. It is planned to expand the plant capacity up to 40000 t/y [25]. In this framework, heat integration and optimisation of reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs) for the production and use of methanol represents a relatively recent area of research and technological development of growing interest. Several papers in the literature have focused on methanol production from hydrogen via RES and recycled CO2. Leonard et al. [26] analysed a system composed of a CO2 capture section (studied in previous works by the same authors [27,28]), a water/CO2 co-electrolysis section via SOEC (solid oxide electrolyser cell) at high temperature (850 °C) and a methanol synthesis section (MSS). This study showed an increase in the overall system efficiency from 40.1 to 53.0% through a correct integration. Yuan et al. [29] analysed a hybrid system consisting of a wind turbine, water electrolysis, hydrogen and oxygen storage, coal-based methanol production (via gasification) and methanol fuel cells. An excess of wind energy feeds the electrolyser to produce hydrogen. Hydrogen and oxygen are stored and hydrogen is used to produce electricity in a fuel cell. Methanol is produced continuously using coal, hydrogen and oxygen, even in the absence of wind. Mermelstein and Posdziech [30] analysed a complex and complete RSOC system. The system was able to serve different purposes: renewable hydrogen production, power-to-gas, energy storage, grid balancing, and power generation via distributed fuel production. The system was composed of a fuel cell, a steam generator, a desalination unit and a hydrogen storage system. Di Giorgio and Desideri [31] studied a system for electrical energy storage (EES) with the aim of hindering issues related to the intermittence of RES. The system was composed of an RSOC and was studied by analysing different high temperature (1050 K) thermal energy storage (TES) technologies, including both latent and sensible heat storage, to optimise the energy balance. Santhanam et al. [32] analysed a conceptual RSOC system considering a high temperature TES system based on phase change materials (PCMs) to supply heat during electrolysis operations in order to quantify the theoretical limit of roundtrip efficiency for both an ideal reactor and a commercially available reactor at different operating pressures. Mottaghizadeh et al. [33] studied a complete self-sustaining system consisting of an RSOC coupled to a methanation process and a high temperature (850 °C) TES system based on PCM, looking for an optimal thermal integration and balance of plant using the Aspen Plus software. Endothermic reactions of the electrolysis process were promoted by the thermal energy stored during fuel cell operation. A roundtrip efficiency of 54.3% was calculated considering reference conditions, increasing up to 60.4% by improving the system design, resulting in a completely thermally self-sustaining system. Ferrero [34] carried out a comprehensive analysis of electricity storage using power-to-gas technology based on RSOCs to produce methane from RES, evaluating the optimal operating conditions. Soltanieh et al. [35] studied the coupling between a natural gas Matiant power plant [36] and a methanol production unit along with an oxy-fuel combustion CO2 capture process and alkaline water electrolysis. In this case, even though the methanol produced cannot be defined as renewable, all of the CO2 produced by the conventional power plant is captured and re-used to produce about 230 kt/y of methanol. Matzen and Demirel [37] analysed the production of methanol and DME using wind power to feed water electrolysis and CO2 captured by an ethanol fermentation plant. The analysis was carried out using several models developed in Aspen Plus. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to verify the environmental impact of these processes and the fuel production phase was found to be the most critical from the LCA point of view, showing, however, the environmental feasibility of the whole production process. In fact, both renewable fuels lead to a reduction of 82–86% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to a reduction of fossil fuel depletion of 82–91% compared to the corresponding conventional production routes. This paper concerns a study of a conceptual integrated power generation system based on the production of methanol via the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Hydrogen is produced from RES through an RSOC in SOEC operating mode and feeds the same RSOC in SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) operating mode. In this work, in contrast to those mentioned above, the integration is carried out between the RSOC system and the hydrogen-to-methanol conversion system. In this way the hydrogen storage is avoided and a more versatile chemical feedstock is produced, although a small hydrogen storage backup might be useful to ensure a constant hydrogen feed to the MSS even when the RES production is not stable. Moreover, in this study, the thermal energy is stored at a low temperature (about 130 °C) in a PCM-TES system, which is used to vaporise water during SOEC operation and in the reboiler in the methanol purification section. In the proposed system, methanol is treated as an energy storage medium and a hydrogen carrier, being produced and stored when renewable energy is available in excess and reformed back to hydrogen to be used in an SOFC to produce electricity during peaks of demand. Since the production of hydrogen in SOEC and its reutilisation after a methanol reforming process in SOFC occur at different times, the system does not require two different cells, but it does need a high temperature RSOC, which can typically be switched from one mode to the other one in a matter of minutes [38]. Using a single RSOC capable of operating in both modes, instead of two separate SOEC and SOFC, allows saving investment costs on some appliances and components and at the same time addressing numerous different markets with only one system (i.e. energy storage, distributed power generation, power to gas or liquids, hydrogen production, etc.) [30,39]. Nevertheless, to improve competitiveness, the optimisation of RSOC materials is required to guarantee a proper system stability [40,41]. Moreover, even though both SOEC and SOFC are characterised by relatively low stability and high degradation rate over time, Graves et al. [42] demonstrated with a 4000 h test that a SOC reversibly cycled between SOEC and SOFC mode, does not incur in degradation and, on the contrary, its ohmic resistance slightly decreases. The paper is mainly focused on the development of SOEC, SOFC and methanol synthesis models and on the integration of the RSOC with a TES system for the optimal management of the heat recovered from the SOFC exhaust gases, enhancing electrolysis and methanol production and increasing the efficiency of the overall system. Although single sub-systems have been analysed thoroughly in the literature and some similar integration studies have been proposed, to the best of authors’ knowledge a power-to-methanol process based specifically on RSOC, CO2 hydrogenation and heat recovery through a low temperature TES has not yet been assessed. As already mentioned, complete and comprehensive electrochemical models of the RSOC in both SOEC and SOFC operating modes were developed and implemented in Aspen Plus V8.8. A kinetic model was also developed to simulate the methanol synthesis process. While other papers analysed an RSOC system based on hydrogen, or coupled to methanation or within co-electrolysis processes, the main novelty of this study is the conversion of electrical energy further towards methanol in a future methanol economy perspective. Besides, the integration with a low temperature PCM-TES system results in a different and new approach compared to the high temperature energy storage systems proposed in the literature. Thermal coupling of the different sections was carried out to verify the feasibility of a self-sustainable system which not only consists of electrolytic hydrogen production, but also of further hydrogen conversion and utilisation for electricity production. Main drawback of the overall system consists of its high cost, related to electricity production from RES and, especially, to high temperature cells. However, in future perspective, these costs are expected to drop sensibly [43–46]. Nowadays, for G20 countries, the fossil fuel-fired power generation cost ranges between 0.05 and 0.17 USD/kWh, depending on the technology and region considered, whereas RES production costs in Europe, also without considering incentives and CO2 tax costs, already have dropped between 0.08 (onshore wind power) and 0.15 (offshore wind power) USD/kWh [47]. At present, PEM and SOEC methanol production processes are of the order of 2.5 and 15 times more expensive than conventional ones from fossil fuels, respectively [43]. However, due to an increase in SOEC installed capacity as well as R&D on cell materials, a large reduction in SOEC costs is foreseen in the next decades leading to an expected cost and lifetime comparable to alkaline and PEM cells by 2030 [43,44], leading this technology to be competitive in the future market."
1,System configuration and modelling,
2,Overall system configuration,"2.1 Overall system configuration The proposed system is composed of the following main sections: - an RSOC section, which operates alternatively in electrolysis mode (SOEC) and in fuel cell mode (SOFC), - a methanol synthesis and distillation section, - a TES section. Fig. 1 shows a simplified process scheme of the overall system considered in this study. SOEC and SOFC are indicated by two distinct blocks to represent the process but they belong to the same reversible RSOC unit. The SOEC is fed with water, air and renewable electricity producing hydrogen and air rich in oxygen. Then the hydrogen is compressed before entering the MSS together with CO2, which might have already been compressed in a previous process or compressed in loco depending on its origin and on the system requirements. Inside the methanol synthesis reactor, H2 and CO2 react to produce methanol which is purified and stored in the liquid phase. Subsequently, the RSOC mode is switched to fuel cell (SOFC), and methanol feeds the SOFC, where it is reformed to hydrogen that oxidises, producing electrical energy. During SOFC operation, the heat released by the hot exhaust is partially stored in the TES system to be subsequently supplied to the SOEC and MSS. Heat integration is necessary to both start the hydrogen production process and provide the residual heat needed by the electrolyser. As mentioned previously, sections of the overall system operate in alternating phases at different times. During periods of excessive electricity production from RES, SOEC and MSS produce hydrogen and methanol, respectively, which is stored. Afterwards, RSOC is switched to the SOFC mode and the stored methanol is fed to the cell producing electricity. The TES system operates in charge mode during SOFC operation and in discharge mode providing heat to the SOEC and MSS during their operation. Typically, SOFCs for stationary application are characterised by a power in the range 10 kW–1 MW [48]. In contrast, commercial RSOCs have lower size, with a maximum power in SOFC mode of about 50 kW, corresponding to an SOEC requirement of about 150 kW. In fact, an integrated system, such as the one proposed, requires a larger size to assume commercial interest. For this reason, looking to a future perspective, an RSOC of about 1 MW power output in SOFC mode was considered in this paper. Such a system requires feeding with about 600 kg/h of methanol, leading to a size of the MSS similar to that of the Olah plant [23,24], smaller than the conventional methanol plants with a size in the range 1500–5000 t/d [49,50]. An operating temperature of the RSOC of 850 °C was assumed in both SOEC and SOFC mode. High temperature RSOCs (HT-RSOCs) allow electrical power input to be reduced in the electrolyser mode and power output to be increased in the fuel cell mode. In fact, the increase in water electrolysis temperature notably reduces electrical energy demand with a corresponding increase in thermal energy request. Overall, the total energy required by electrolysis increases slightly [51,52]. Among other advantages, HT-SOCs: a) favour the kinetics of the reactions and minimise the electrochemical losses, resulting in higher efficiency; b) can be directly fed with different hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, without an external reformer and are less influenced by impurities in the fuel; c) are easily coupled to existing high temperature processes; and d) operate in both electrolyser and fuel cell modes without a substantial difference in performance level [53–55]. The following paragraphs provide a description of the models developed to simulate and predict the performance of the SOEC, methanol synthesis and SOFC sections."
3,SOEC section,"2.2 SOEC section The main component of the SOEC system is the electrochemical cell, consisting of both an anode and cathode, where the electrolytic reactions occur. The SOEC system also includes blocks such as heat exchangers, mixers and separators. Fig. 2 shows a simplified functional scheme of the SOEC section. Water (1E) feeds the SOEC at ambient temperature (25 °C), then it is preheated, vaporised and superheated (H1E) up to the operating temperature (850 °C). Afterwards, it is mixed with a fraction (9E) of the cathode exhaust (8E) in the mixer M1E to obtain a molar composition of the cell inlet equal to 90% water and 10% hydrogen to prevent electrode oxidation [56–58]. Inside the reactor (R1E), water electrolysis is accomplished with the following reaction (1): (1) H 2 O → H 2 + 0.5 O 2 which is given by the combination of the cathode reaction (2) and anode reactions (3), (4): (2) H 2 O + 2 e - → H 2 + O 2 - (3) O 2 - → 0.5 O 2 + 2 e - (4) O + O → O 2 The utilisation factor of water inside the reactor (i.e. the mass flow ratio between the water converted to hydrogen and the water at the reactor inlet) was set to 0.85. Both a cathode exhaust and an anode exhaust exit the cell: the first (8E) is composed of water vapour and hydrogen, and the latter (6E) by air rich in oxygen. In fact, air (4E) is fed to the SOEC as a sweep gas to clean the anode side. The air rich in oxygen is then cooled down (C2E) to the established SOEC exit temperature (7E), allowing thermal energy to be recovered. The water/hydrogen mixture (8E) is split (S1E) to ensure the required water/hydrogen ratio at the reactor inlet; the remaining flow (10E) is cooled down (C1E) to condense water vapour in the mixture. Gaseous hydrogen (12E) is then separated (S2E) by the liquid water (13E) and sent to the MSS. Table 2 reports the main operating parameters of the SOEC system. 2.2.1 Electrochemical model An electrochemical model based on equations proposed by Ni et al. [59–61] for planar cells was developed to describe the RSOC operation. The electrochemical equations were adapted and implemented in a Fortran routine in Aspen Plus. Indeed, two separate models were developed to simulate SOEC and SOFC processes. Indeed, the two SOEC and SOFC models are mostly identical and differ just for the concentration overpotential equations. Consequently, switching from one to another equation is achieved simply by exchanging the “anode” with the “cathode” subscription. The electrochemical characteristic and parameters are associated to the typical Ni YSZ-LSM electrode/electrolyte material. The models were validated, for both SOEC and SOFC mode, in a temperature range (800–1000 °C) typical of high temperature solid oxide cell systems [62,63], following experimental data reported by the same authors [59–61]. In the electrochemical SOEC/SOFC model, the equilibrium voltage E eq is expressed by Nernst equation given by Eq. (5): (5) E eq = E 0 + R T c 2 F ln p H 2 p O 2 1 2 p H 2 O where E 0 is the reversible potential [V], R is the universal gas constant [J/(mol K)], T c is the operating temperature of the cell [K], F is the Faraday constant [C/mol], and p i is the partial pressure of the generic chemical species. The reversible potential E 0 is calculated as a function of cell temperature by Eq. (6) [62]: (6) E 0 = 1.253 - 2.4516 · 10 - 4 T c Partial pressures at electrodes surface are calculated as mean values of the cathode and anode inlet and outlet [64]. The net voltage of the cell ( E SOEC and E SOFC ) is expressed by Eq. (7), by adding or subtracting the overpotentials η i to the equilibrium voltage E eq : (7) E SOEC / S O F C = E eq ± η act + η conc an + η act + η conc cat + η ohm where η act and η conc represent the activation and concentration overpotentials for both the anode and cathode, respectively, and η ohm the ohmic overpotential. Ohmic overpotential is estimated using Eq. (8) [65]: (8) η ohm = J t el ρ where t el is the electrolyte thickness [m], J is the current density [A/m2] and ρ is the electrical resistivity [Ω m] defined by Eq. (9): (9) ρ = 2.99 · 10 - 5 e x p 10300 T c Activation overpotentials are derived from the Butler-Volmer equation [66] and are defined by Eq. (10): (10) η act , i = R T c F sinh - 1 J 2 J 0 , i = R T c F ln J 2 J 0 , i + J 2 J 0 , i 2 + 1 Exchange current densities J 0 , i are defined by Eqs. (11) and (12): (11) J 0 , a n = γ an exp - E act , a n R T c (12) J 0 , c a t = γ cat exp - E act , c a t R T c where γ an and γ cat are the pre-exponential factors, and E act , a n and E act , c a t are the activation energy levels (at zero overpotential) for the anode and cathode, respectively. These parameters are found in the literature for the Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM electrode [61,67]. As previously specified, concentration overpotential equations differ from SOEC to SOFC. SOEC concentration overpotentials are calculated by Eqs. (13) and (14) [60]: (13) η conc , a n = R T c 2 F ln 1 + JR T c d an 4 F D O 2 eff p O 2 0 1 2 (14) η conc , c a t = R T c 2 F ln 1 + J R T c d cat / ( 2 F D H 2 O eff p H 2 0 ) 1 - J R T c d cat / ( 2 F D H 2 O eff p H 2 O 0 ) where p i 0 are the anode and cathode mean pressures [Pa], d an and d cat are the anode and cathode thickness [m], respectively, and D O 2 eff and D H 2 O eff are the effective diffusion coefficients for oxygen and steam [m/s2], respectively. The diffusion is related to both the interaction between molecules and that between molecules and pores. Effective diffusion coefficients are calculated using Bosanquet equations (15), (16): (15) 1 D O 2 eff = ξ η 1 D O 2 - N 2 + 1 D O 2 , K (16) 1 D H 2 O eff = ξ η 1 D H 2 - H 2 O + 1 D H 2 , K where ξ / η is the tortuosity versus porosity ratio, D O 2 - N 2 and D H 2 - H 2 O the molecular diffusion coefficients of oxygen in air (nitrogen) and of hydrogen in water vapour, and D O 2 , K and D H 2 , K the Knudsen diffusion coefficients of oxygen and hydrogen, respectively. The molecular diffusion coefficients and the Knudsen diffusion coefficients are evaluated referring to the Chapman–Enskog theory of ideal gas [68]. In general, Eqs. (15) and (16) can be written as the Bosanquet formula (17) (interpolation formula supported by the kinetic theory of gases [69]) to evaluate the diffusion coefficient in the transition region [70]: (17) 1 D electrode eff = ξ η 1 D i - j + 1 D i , K where D i - j , the molecular diffusion of the species i in the species j, can be expressed using the equations from Eqs. (18)–(23), as proposed in [68], referring to the Chapman-Enskog theory of ideal gas, while D i , k (Knudsen diffusion coefficient for the species i related to the self-diffusion coefficient derived from the kinetic theory of gases [71]) is calculated by Eq. (24). (18) D i - j = 0.0000266 T c 3 2 p M i , j 1 2 σ i , j 2 Ω D in which p [bar], T c [K], D i - j [m2/s], and the molecular weight M i , j [g/mol] is expressed by Eq. (19): (19) M i , j = 2 1 M i + 1 M j - 1 σ i , j [Å] is the mean characteristic length of species i and j: (20) σ i , j = σ i + σ j 2 Ω D is the diffusion collision integral (which is dimensionless) given by Eq. (21): (21) Ω D = 1.06036 Γ 0.15610 + 0.19300 exp 0.47635 Γ + 1.03587 exp 1.52996 Γ + 1.76474 exp 3.89411 Γ in which Γ is a dimensionless temperature coefficient expressed by Eq. (22): (22) Γ = T c ε i , j where ε i , j is the Lennard-Jones energy [K]: (23) ε i , j = ε i k B ε j k B being k B the Boltzmann’s constant. Table 3 reports the main parameters for effective diffusion coefficient calculations [68]: The Knudsen diffusion is expressed as [72,73]: (24) D i , K = d p 3 8000 R T c π M i where R is the universal gas constant [J/(mol K)], d p the mean pore size [m] and M i the molecular weight [g/mol], so that D i , K results in m2/s. In the case of the SOFC, the concentration overpotentials are different from the corresponding overpotentials of the SOEC. In particular, in the SOFC model, Eqs. (25) and (26) are used [61,74]: (25) η conc , a n = R T c 2 F ln 1 + J R T c d an / ( 2 F D H 2 O eff p H 2 O 0 ) 1 - J R T c d an / ( 2 F D H 2 O eff p H 2 0 ) (26) η conc , c a t = R T c 4 F ln p O 2 0 p c δ O 2 - p c δ O 2 - p O 2 0 exp JR T c d cat δ O 2 4 F D O 2 eff p c where p c is the cell operating pressure [Pa]. The dimensionless coefficient δ O 2 is defined by Eq. (27): (27) δ O 2 = D O 2 , K eff D O 2 , K eff + D O 2 eff where D O 2 , K eff is the effective Knudsen diffusion of oxygen, defined as the oxygen Knudsen diffusion coefficient, multiplied by η / ξ . Since SOFC and SOEC are the two operating modes for the same RSOC, the geometric characteristics of the cell, reported in Table 4 , are the same."
4,Methanol synthesis section,"2.3 Methanol synthesis section The MSS allows the production of methanol through the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 [25,75,76]. The core of the system is the synthesis reactor, where pressurised H2 and CO2 react to produce methanol. The catalytic process is based on the commercial catalyst Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. Fig. 3 shows a simplified functional scheme of the methanol synthesis and purification section. The hydrogen (1 M) produced during SOEC operation and CO2 are first compressed in two intercooled compression trains up to a suitable pressure for the methanol synthesis process (in this case assumed equal to 65 bar) and then mixed (M1M) with compressed recycle gas (27 M) obtaining a hydrogen-rich stream (13 M). Both compressor trains are each composed of 3 compressors (CP1M-CP2M-CP3M and CP4M-CP5M-CP6M) and two intercoolers (IC1M-IC2M and IC3M-IC4M). The pressure ratio of each compressor was set to a value slightly higher than 4, whereas the intercooling temperature was set at 38 °C. The hydrogen-rich stream 13 M is heated up (H1M) to 210 °C (14 M). Inside the reactor (R1M), assumed adiabatic, the temperature increases due to exothermic reactions. Downstream of the reactor, hot products (15 M) are cooled down (C1M) to 50 °C. At this temperature a first flash process (F1M) occurs, separating the unreacted gas (22 M), largely composed of hydrogen, from the liquid water/methanol mixture (17 M). A further flash (F2M) is performed at a lower pressure (1.2 bar) and temperature (22 °C) to separate the residual gases, mainly composed of CO2. Incondensable gases (25 M) from F2M are compressed up to 65 bar (CP7M), mixed together in M2M and then in M1M with reactor feeding (6 M and 12 M). To avoid the accumulation of by-products, 1% by volume of the recycled gas is extracted as purge gas (23 M). The liquid stream (18 M) is then heated up to 80 °C (H2M) before entering the distillation column (D1M). From the bottom of the distillation column, water (21 M) is recuperated in the liquid phase and can be recycled back to the SOEC. From the top of the distillation column, almost pure methanol (20 M) with a small content of carbon dioxide is gathered and methanol and CO2 are subsequently separated through methanol condensation. Methanol is then sent to the storage tank to be used to feed the RSOC in SOFC mode. Table 5 reports the main operating parameters of the MSS. The main blocks of the MSS are the reactor and the distillation column, which were implemented in Aspen Plus through the blocks RPlug reactor and RadFrac column, respectively. Tables 6 and 7 report the main parameters of the reactor and distillation column, respectively. Three different equations were considered for methanol production from carbon dioxide hydrogenation: carbon monoxide conversion (28), CO2 hydrogenation (29) and reverse water gas shift reaction (30): (28) CO + 2 H 2 → C H 3 O H (29) C O 2 + 3 H 2 → C H 3 O H + H 2 O (30) C O 2 + H 2 → H 2 O + C O As these reactions are linearly dependent, only Eqs. (29) and (30) were taken into account in the developed model. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood Hougen-Watson (LHHW) model was assumed as a kinetic model of the synthesis reactor, as proposed by Van-Dal and Bouallou [76], and rearranged to be compatible with the Aspen Plus input. The kinetic model was developed by Van-Dal and Bouallou starting from the original Vanden Bussche and Froment [77] model, modified by Mignard and Pritchard [78]. In particular, reaction rates for Eqs. (29) and (30) are given by Eqs. (31) and (32): (31) r C H 3 O H = k 1 P C O 2 P H 2 - k 6 P H 2 O P C H 3 O H P H 2 - 2 1 + k 2 P H 2 O P H 2 - 1 + k 3 P H 2 0.5 + k 4 P H 2 O 3 (32) r CO = k 5 P C O 2 - k 7 P H 2 O P CO P H 2 - 1 1 + k 2 P H 2 O P H 2 - 1 + k 3 P H 2 0.5 + k 4 P H 2 O where the kinetic constant values k i were calculated by Eq. (33): (33) ln k i = A i + B i T Table 8 reports the kinetic parameters considered for the LHHW model."
5,SOFC section,"2.4 SOFC section The stored methanol feeds an RSOC in the SOFC mode to produce electrical energy. Even though the same RSOC is used for both the SOEC mode and the SOFC mode, the SOFC flowsheet differs from the SOEC one due to the different operating modes. Fig. 4 shows a simplified functional scheme of the SOFC section. The cell is fed with methanol (1F), water (3F) and air (7F). Fuel and water are preheated and vaporised in H1F and H2F (at 64.6 °C and 100 °C, respectively) and then mixed with the anode recycle (14F) in M1F. Through the recycling of high-temperature anode exhausts, the gas rich in methanol and water vapour (5F) reaches a temperature of 300 °C and enters the reformer (RF1F). Reforming reactions allow the hydrogen content to be increased and the carbon monoxide content to be reduced in the cell feeding (6F). Inside the cell (R1F), hydrogen reacts with air (8F), previously heated in H3F, producing electricity and hot steam. The solid oxide fuel cell is simulated as an electrochemical reactor, operating at 850 °C and at atmospheric pressure, as in the SOEC mode. The SOFC operates with a hydrogen utilisation factor of 0.85. Cathode exhaust (10F) together with a portion of the anode exhaust (11F) feed a post-combustor (PC1F), where residual fuel (mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with traces of unreacted methanol) is burnt, producing heat to support fuel cell operation. Combustion products (12F) are cooled down (C1F). A great portion of the heat produced by the SOFC is used for supporting cell operation, but residual heat can be recovered and stored in the TES for later use in both SOEC and MSS sections. Equilibrium reactions at a constant temperature of 300 °C were considered for simulating the reforming process. In particular, methanol decomposition (34), water gas shift (WGS) conversion (35) and methanol steam reforming reaction (36): (34) C H 3 O H → 2 H 2 + C O (35) CO + H 2 O → H 2 + C O 2 (36) C H 3 O H + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + C O 2 Inside the cell, hydrogen and oxygen react according to Eq. (37): (37) H 2 + 0.5 O 2 → H 2 O The hydrogen-oxygen reaction reported by Eq. (37) is the combination of the partial electrochemical reactions (38), (39) at the two electrode sides: (38) H 2 + O 2 - → H 2 O + 2 e - (39) 0.5 O 2 + 2 e - → O 2 - The electrochemical model of the cell is the same as that reported in Section 2.2 for the SOEC and is derived from Ni et al. [61]. Table 9 reports the main operating parameters of the SOFC."
6,Thermal energy storage system,"2.5 Thermal energy storage system The overall system includes a TES system for storing the thermal energy recovered from the SOFC exhaust gases when the RSOC operates in SOFC mode. Afterwards, the stored thermal energy is handed over to both the SOEC and the methanol synthesis systems when the RSOC operates in SOEC mode. Since the stored thermal energy is handed over at a constant temperature (water vaporisation in the SOEC section and re-boiling duty in the distillation column), a TES system based on PCM was considered in this study. Among the suitable materials an organic mixture of potassium nitrate KNO3 (67%) and lithium nitrate LiNO3 (33%) was chosen. The main characteristics of the chosen PCM are reported in Table 10 [79–81]. A time-dependent model of the TES system for analysing its dynamic behaviour in the overall integrated system, presently in progress, was not among the purposes of this study. For this reason it was assumed that the TES system is able to carry out the charge and discharge phases, instantaneously following the requests for heat exchange with the other sections. Also, thermal losses were ignored for simplicity."
7,System analysis and discussion of results,"The energy system proposed in this paper is easily scalable, with just a few issues related to the RSOC size. As previously mentioned, the size of the overall system was established assuming an SOFC nominal power of around 1.5 MW. Actually, an SOFC based on a methanol feed of about 600 kg/h, similar to that of the sole commercial renewable methanol production plant currently in operation was considered [23]. Assuming a ratio between air and hydrogen of 4 by volume [82,83], the SOFC also requires an air feed of about 12000 kg/h. Finally, imposing a steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR) equal to 1.25 [84], and considering the recycling of anode exhaust, this resulted in a water feed to the SOFC of around 245 kg/h. The specific electricity consumption of the SOEC is about 34 kWh/kgH2, which is close to the values found in the literature [85]. In the proposed system, the methanol consumption in the SOFC (600 kg/h) was assumed equal to the methanol production in the MSS, leading to the same operating time for both the methanol production process (SOEC and MSS) and the methanol utilisation (SOFC). To produce 600 kg/h of methanol, a hydrogen feed in the MSS equal to about 120 kg/h is required. Assuming a molar ratio CO2/H2 slightly higher than the stoichiometric one [49,86], a carbon dioxide feeding of about 880 kg/h was also calculated for the MSS. Since SOEC and MSS operate in series at the same time, the hydrogen production by the SOEC is equal to the MSS consumption (about 120 kg/h). To produce such a quantity of hydrogen, a water feeding of about 1250 kg/h is required, leading to an electrical power requirement that is slightly higher than 4 MW. Globally, the input/output power ratio of the RSOC is about 3.5, which is consistent with the state of the art of RSOC [87]. The size of the methanol storage tank and of the TES system strictly depends on the operating time of both the production and utilisation phases of methanol. In this study, an operating period at constant nominal conditions was set to 6 h for both phases, under the hypothesis that an excess of RES electricity production is constantly available during the whole SOEC operation period. Obviously, considering a greater or lower operating period just leads to a different size of both the methanol storage tank and TES system. In 6 h, the MSS produces about 3600 kg of methanol, leading to a volume of liquid methanol stored for feeding the SOFC of about 4.5 m3. Tables 11–13 report the composition of the main flows in the SOEC, methanol synthesis and SOFC sections, along with mass flow and temperature. The compressors account for an overall power requirement of about 420 kW, mainly due to the hydrogen compression (about 290 kW). As described previously, several heating and cooling processes take place in different sections of the overall system, requiring an accurate analysis to identify a correct coupling between the different flows to enhance system performance. Firstly, an internal heat recovery was performed inside each section (SOEC, MSS and SOFC) to reduce the external requirements of thermal energy. However, the integration of different sections of the overall system is hampered since SOEC and MSS operate at different times than SOFC; therefore, the overall system can be assumed to be composed of two independent systems (production of methanol and utilisation of methanol). As a consequence, without considering any TES system, a regenerative heat exchange was allowed between SOEC and MSS. Finally, a TES system based on PCM was introduced to allow a thermal integration with the SOFC. Table 14 shows the major heating and cooling requirements in the different sections. A steady state behaviour was assumed for all processes, considering the system to already have started and be operational. Table 14 shows that the SOEC total heating requirements (H1E and H2E) largely exceed the thermal power recoverable by cooling down (C1E and C2E) the hot gas to ambient temperature, especially due to the thermal energy required to preheat, vaporise and superheat the water feeding the electrolyser (about 1450 kW). On the contrary, the SOFC heating requirements are lower than the thermal power that is potentially available from exhaust cooling. Initially, a pinch analysis was carried out to evaluate the maximum thermal energy recoverable with an optimal coupling of the hot and cold fluids in the overall system. Actually, a compromise solution was adopted with regard to that suggested by the pinch analysis, allowing to a simpler heat exchanger network without unduly affecting the overall heat recovery process."
8,Internal heat recovery and thermal energy balance of the SOEC section,"3.1 Internal heat recovery and thermal energy balance of the SOEC section An internal heat recovery was performed inside the SOEC to increase cell performance, but a large amount of thermal energy is still needed to fully satisfy its thermal energy requirements. Two heating and two cooling processes take place inside the SOEC. As can be seen from Fig. 2 on the cathode side, liquid water at 25 °C and ambient pressure is preheated, and then vaporised and superheated up to 850 °C (H1E); the mixture of unreacted water vapour and hydrogen is cooled (C1E), whereas on the anode side sweep air is heated up from ambient temperature to 850 °C (H2E) and air plus oxygen is cooled (C2E). Fig. 5a shows the simplified functional scheme of the SOEC section with thermal integration, whereas Fig. 5b shows the heat transfer processes described below in a T-Q diagram. In particular, red lines represent cooling processes of: MSS cooling water (a), anode exhaust (c), and cathode exhaust (f). Blue lines represent heating processes: feeding water preheating (b), partial vaporisation (d) and superheating (g), and sweep air heating (e). On the anode side, hot (850 °C) exhausts (6E) are used for preheating (HX5E) the cold sweep air (4E) up to 800 °C (assuming a minimum temperature difference of 50 °C). Globally, the energy that can be recovered by coupling the cold sweep air to the anode exhaust is about 320 kW. About 20 kW of thermal power still needs to be supplied by an additional heater (H3E) to complete the sweep air heating process from 800 to 850 °C. As the anode exhaust (6E) is composed of both the sweep air plus the oxygen produced in the SOEC, heating the sweep air from ambient temperature to 800 °C just cools the anode exhaust down to about 405 °C (7E), allowing further heat recovery. The residual thermal energy of the anode exhaust is recovered (HX2E) by the preheating of the SOEC feed water (1EI) from 80 to 100 °C and by its partial vaporisation. This process produces about 240 of the 1250 kg/h of the water vapour required by the SOEC, reducing the anode exhausts temperature to about 130 °C (7EI) and allowing an additional 180 kW to be recovered. As the heat released by the anode exhaust allows about a fifth of the global water vapour requirement to be produced, an external heat source is still required to complete the vaporisation process (HX3E), furnishing about 640 kW. The water vapour is superheated (HX4E) by recovering thermal energy from the hot cathode exhaust (10E) (a mixture of unreacted water vapour and hydrogen) which is cooled from 850 °C to 150 °C (11E). This process allows about 420 kW to be recovered, leading to a water vapour temperature of about 682 °C. The cathode exhaust is then cooled down (C3E) to allow the condensation of water and the production of pure hydrogen. To complete the water vapour superheating to 850 °C, it is necessary to provide additional thermal power equal to about 135 kW by an external source (H4E). Prior to water vaporisation and superheating, water at 25 °C (1E) must be preheated (HX1E) to 80 °C (1EI), exploiting a low temperature thermal energy source, if possible. A source was identified in the hot cooling water (CW1E) from the hydrogen intercoolers (IC1M and IC2M), where hydrogen is cooled to about 40 °C from 220 and 240 °C, respectively, releasing more than 180 kW. Hot (90 °C) cooling water is used to preheat SOEC feeding water up to 80 °C, allowing a further thermal energy saving of about 80 kW. Globally, slightly more than 1 MW of thermal power is recovered, mainly, exploiting both anode (520 kW) and cathode exhaust (420 kW). Less than 100 kW is recovered from the cooling water of the hydrogen intercoolers of the MSS. As a matter of fact, an external energy input of about 800 kW is still required to complete the heating of both sweep air and steam up to 850 °C and to complete the water vaporisation."
9,Internal heat recovery and thermal energy balance of the methanol synthesis section,"3.2 Internal heat recovery and thermal energy balance of the methanol synthesis section As for the SOEC, the system configuration allows an internal heat recovery to also be performed inside the MSS. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 14, the main thermal energy source can be identified in the cooling process of the synthesis reactor products (C1M) that need to be cooled from about 295 °C to about 20 °C to separate methanol and water from incondensable gases. Other possible thermal energy sources are the cooling water of the intercooled compressors. Thermal energy from hydrogen intercoolers (IC1M and IC2M) is used for water preheating in the SOEC, while no recovery from the cooling water of CO2 intercoolers (IC3M and IC4M) was considered since, depending on the origin, already compressed CO2 could feed the MSS, avoiding the use of a dedicated compressor. Fig. 6a shows the simplified functional scheme of the MSS section with thermal integration, whereas Fig. 6b shows the heat transfer processes described below in a T-Q diagram. In particular, red line represents the cooling of synthesis products and blue lines represents the heating of liquid water-methanol mixtures (a) and reactor feeds (b). The cooling of hot MSS products allows heating the reactor feed (composed of compressed hydrogen and CO2 and incondensable gases recycled) (HX1M) and the liquid water-methanol mixture to be fed into the distillation column (HX2M). The first is heated from 75 °C to 210 °C, recovering about 560 kW and reducing MSS products temperature from 292 °C to about 155 °C. The latter is heated from 22 °C to 80 °C, absorbing about 220 kW, leading to a final temperature of the MSS products which is slightly lower than 120 °C. The residual thermal energy to bring the reactor product to about 50 °C set in F1M is taken away via an external cooler (C2M). Due to its low temperature, the residual heat from 120 °C to 50 °C (around 660 kW) is not recovered. Finally, part of the heat stored in the TES system is used to provide energy to the re-boiling process in the distillation column. The thermal energy required by this process is 290 kW."
10,Internal heat recovery and thermal energy balance of the SOFC section,"3.3 Internal heat recovery and thermal energy balance of the SOFC section The exothermic reactions that take place inside the cell produce a large amount of thermal energy which is used: a) to preheat and vaporise methanol (H1F) and water (H2F), b) to sustain endothermic reforming reactions (RF1F), c) to increase the temperature of the reformed gas up to that of the cell operation (850 °C) and d) to complete air heating up to the cell operating temperature. As shown in Table 14, the thermal energy made available by cooling the hot cell exhaust (C1F) largely overcomes the remaining SOFC heating requirement for the air heating (H3F). Due to the exothermic reactions taking place in the post-combustor, the hot cell exhaust gases are characterised by a temperature slightly lower than 990 °C. Fig. 7a shows the simplified functional scheme of the SOFC section with thermal integration, whereas Fig. 7b shows the heat transfer process in a T-Q chart for the hot exhaust gases and both the TES-PCM system (a) and the cold air (b). According to the cell heat balance, the air (7F) must be heated from 25 °C up to about 760 °C, requiring about 2690 kW. Such a thermal power can be obtained cooling the hot exhaust (12F) down to about 380 °C (HX1F). The residual thermal energy of the exhaust (13F) can be released (HX2F) and stored in the TES system. Considering the previous finding, a total thermal power of about 930 kW must be released by the TES system to complete water vaporisation in the SOEC and satisfy the requirement of the re-boiling process inside the distillation column in the MSS. Neglecting for simplicity of the thermal losses of the TES system, the hot exhaust gases are cooled down to about 160 °C (13FI). The PCM stores the power in question (930 kW) as latent heat at 133 °C."
11,TES system,"3.4 TES system To store the energy needed for the process, considering an operating time of each phase equal to 6 h, a TES-PCM system is needed with a capacity slightly higher than 5500 kWh. The organic mixture of potassium nitrate KNO3 (67%) and lithium nitrate LiNO3 (33%) considered here is characterised by a latent heat of fusion equal to 170 kJ/kg, leading to a thermal energy storage capacity of 47.22 kWh/t. As mentioned previously, the present study assumes that the TES system is able to carry out the charge and discharge phases, instantaneously following the requests for heat exchange with the other sections. Under this assumption, a total mass of 116.5 t is needed for 6 h of operation, corresponding to a TES volume of about 56.8 m3 and considering a PCM density in liquid phase (the lowest one) of 1950 kg/m3."
12,Performance indexes of the system,"3.5 Performance indexes of the system The definition of a global performance index for an overall energy system such as that proposed in this paper can be ambiguous, due to its complexity and the management of different forms of energy. In fact, the performance of SOEC, MSS and SOFC can be evaluated through suitable efficiency indexes, but several differently defined performance indexes can be found in the literature. The efficiency of the SOEC η SOEC can be defined as in [88] by Eq. (40): (40) η SOEC = m ̇ H 2 · H i , H 2 P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C where m ̇ H 2 and H i , H 2 are the mass flow and the lower heating value of the hydrogen, respectively, P SOEC and P BOP , S O E C are the electric power of the SOEC and of the SOEC auxiliaries, respectively. The efficiency of the SOFC η SOFC can be defined similarly to that of the SOEC by Eq. (41): (41) η SOFC = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C m ̇ MeOH · H i , M e O H where P SOFC and P BOP , S O F C are the electric power of the SOFC and of the SOEC auxiliaries, respectively, and m ̇ MeOH and H i , M e O H are the mass flow and the lower heating value of the methanol, respectively. For the RSOC, an overall round trip efficiency can be defined ignoring (gross efficiency, η RSOC , G ) or including (net efficiency, η RSOC ) the parasitic power consumption incurred by the balance of the plant, as shown by Eqs. (42) and (43), respectively [33,89]: (42) η RSOC , G = P SOFC P SOEC (43) η RSOC = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C Referring to the net efficiency, η RSOC , by combining Eqs. (40), (41) and (43), the following Eq. (44) is obtained: (44) η RSOC = η SOEC · η SOFC m ̇ MeOH · H i , M e O H m ̇ H 2 · H i , H 2 = η SOEC · η SOFC · η MSS , C where η MSS , C is the chemical energy conversion efficiency of the MSS, defined analogously to a gasifier “cold gas” efficiency. The actual MSS overall efficiency can be defined by Eq. (45) [49]: (45) η MSS = m ̇ MeOH · H i , M e O H m ̇ H 2 · H i , H 2 + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S The term E ̇ MSS is the external power supplied to the MSS to preheat the reactants. In Eq. (45), E ̇ MSS is assumed to be introduced in the form of chemical potential power as the methanol and hydrogen chemical power in the same Eq. (45) and in Eqs. (40) and (41), which is then converted into thermal power inside the MSS. For this reason, Eqs. (40), (41) and (45) are thermodynamically consistent. Finally, P BOP , M S S is the power requirement of the MSS auxiliaries, mainly due to the compression of the reactants. A global efficiency can be defined for the overall system using Eq. (46): (46) η G = P SOFC - P BOP , S O F C P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S By combining Eq. (46) with Eqs. (40), (41) and (44) and rearranging the various terms, the following Eq. (47) is obtained: (47) η G = η SOEC · η SOFC · η MSS , C · φ SOEC = η RSOC · φ SOEC being: (48) φ SOEC = P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S The term φ SOEC , given by Eq. (48), represents the fraction of power entering the SOEC with respect to the total power entering the overall system. It is ideally equal to 1 in case the MSS does not require an external power supply ( E ̇ MSS = 0 , P BOP , M S S = 0 ). Moreover, by combining Eq. (47) with Eq. (45), one obtains the following alternative expression of the overall efficiency: (49) η G = η SOEC , R · η SOFC · η MSS where η SOEC , R is a rectified efficiency of the SOEC given by Eq. (50): (50) η SOEC , R = m ̇ H 2 · H i , H 2 + ( E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S ) P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C + ( E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S ) The term η SOEC , R coincides with η SOEC again when the MSS does not require an external power supply ( E ̇ MSS = 0 , P BOP , M S S = 0 ). In this case, obviously, it is also η MSS = η MSS , C . From a physical point of view, the rectified efficiency η SOEC , R represents the efficiency that the SOEC would have if it was also powered with the power ( E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S ) entering the MSS, returning this power in full to the MSS together with the hydrogen produced. Also, by combining Eqs. (47) and (49), the following Eq. (51) is obtained: (51) η RSOC = η SOEC , R φ SOEC · η SOFC · η MSS as well as: (52) η SOEC · φ SOEC · η MSS , C = η SOEC , R · η MSS Eq. (52) synthesises the correlation between the relevant efficiency parameters of the comprehensive SOEC-MSS system. Finally, these parameters can be used to define the efficiency of the power to liquid process η PtL as Eq. (53): (53) η PtL = m ̇ MeOH · H i , M e O H P SOEC + P BOP , S O E C + E ̇ MSS + P BOP , M S S = η SOEC · φ SOEC · η MSS , C The above-mentioned performance indexes were applied to two different system configurations: a) with a simple thermal integration without TES and b) with the introduction of the TES system. Table 15 reports a summary of the power and energy requested and produced by the different sections in the two different configurations: a and b. From these values, the performance indexes were calculated. While P SOEC and P SOFC represent the power absorbed and produced by the electrochemical reactions, the terms P BOP , S O E C and P BOP , S O F C include the power requirements of the electrical heaters (inverters, cooling power, and fan and pump power are ignored). For each section, the chemical power of hydrogen or methanol is also shown. Finally, Table 16 synthesises the main performance indexes of the different sections of the plant and the global efficiency of the two different cases: a) with a simple thermal integration without a TES system and b) with the introduction of the TES system. Table 16 shows that the global efficiency of the overall system without TES is about 0.276 and increases to 0.329 by introducing the TES system. On the one hand, this poor performance value is mainly due to the low value of the SOFC efficiency (slightly lower than 0.50), due to the use of methanol instead of hydrogen. On the other hand, the efficiency of the PtL section is higher than 0.56 without TES and increases up to 0.67 by introducing a TES section, values sensibly higher than those reported in Table 1 for many other PtL processes. The introduction of the TES system, reducing the external requirements of thermal energy, largely affects both SOEC and MSS efficiency. The first increases from 0.83 to 0.95, whereas the second increases from 0.66 to 0.70. Globally, the efficiency of the RSOC increases from 0.32 to 0.36."
13,Conclusions,"This paper reports an analysis of a conceptual integrated power generation system based on the production of methanol via the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. Hydrogen is produced from RES through an RSOC in the SOEC operating mode and feeds the same RSOC in the SOFC operating mode. In the proposed system, methanol is treated as an energy storage medium and a hydrogen carrier, which is produced and stored when renewable energy is available in excess and reformed back to hydrogen for use in an SOFC to produce electricity during the peaks of demand. The paper is mainly focused on the development of complete and comprehensive models of the SOEC, SOFC and MSS and on the integration of the RSOC and MSS with a TES system for the optimal management of heat recovered from the SOFC exhaust gases, enhancing electrolysis and methanol production and increasing the efficiency of the overall system. Even though single sub-systems have been analysed thoroughly in the literature, a power-to-methanol process based specifically on RSOC, CO2 hydrogenation and heat recovery through a low temperature TES has not yet been assessed. While other papers analysed an RSOC system based on hydrogen, or coupled to methanation, or within co-electrolysis processes, the main novelty of this study is the further conversion of electrical energy towards methanol in a future methanol economy perspective. Also, the integration with a low temperature PCM-TES system results in a different and new approach compared to the high temperature energy storage systems proposed in the literature. An SOFC nominal power of 1.5 MW was assumed based on a methanol feed of about 600 kg/h, which is similar to that of the sole commercial renewable methanol production plant that is currently in operation. The specific electricity consumption of the SOEC was about 34 kWh/kgH2. The SOEC shows an electrical power requirement that is slightly higher than 4 MW. Globally, the input/output power ratio of the RSOC is about 3.5, which is consistent with the state of the art RSOC. For an operating time of 6 h, the MSS produces about 3600 kg of methanol, leading to a volume of liquid methanol stored for feeding the SOFC equal to about 4.5 m3. The compressor trains of the MSS account for an overall power requirement of about 380 kW, mainly due to the hydrogen compressors. Moreover, the overall system requires more than 1 MW of thermal power from external sources. The integration with a TES system can almost completely satisfy this requirement. In fact, a total thermal power of about 930 kW can be stored and subsequently released by the TES system for the completion of water vaporisation in the SOEC and to feed the re-boiling process inside the distillation column in the MSS. The TES-PCM capacity required to store the energy needed for the process, was slightly higher than 5500 kWh. As the organic mixture of potassium nitrate KNO3 and lithium nitrate LiNO3 is characterised by a thermal energy storage capacity of 47.22 kWh/t, a total mass of 116.5 t is required, corresponding to a TES volume of about 56.8 m3. The introduction of a TES system, reducing the external requirements of thermal energy, largely affects both SOEC and MSS efficiency and consequently the global efficiency. The global efficiency of the overall system without the TES system is slightly higher than 0.28. Global efficiency increases up to 0.33, also considering the integration with the TES system. At present, even though SOEC methanol production is more expensive than other processes, using a totally favourable scenario with increased stack lifespan and electrolyser cost reduction, methanol cost production via SOEC will reach international market values. Future investigations will consider an SOEC operating at high pressure in order to increase its efficiency and reduce the compressor requirements in the MSS and the development of an accurate dynamic model of the TES system, meaning that it is necessary to evaluate its time-dependent behaviour during charge and discharge phases."
