0,Introduction,"Food packaging is an important part of the food industry. Currently, the majority of food packaging is made from petroleum-based polymers as they are inexpensive and easy to process and can be produced in large quantities. However, there are serious environmental issues associated with their use, including the depletion of fossil resources and global warming. Therefore, the development of bio-based polymers has recently attracted increasing attention. The biodegradability, non-toxicity, and selective antioxidant properties of composites made from bio-based polymers have been studied for applications in food packaging. Naturally active films also represent suitable substitutes for use as commercial plastics as they do not cause any inherent food contamination. Moreover, active films, which have biological activities, show good interactions and biocompatibilities with the food, such as increasing the antioxidant activities of certain foods [1–3]. Therefore, active packaging films are being increasingly used to extend the shelf life of food products and monitor the food quality. Phenolic compounds are plant-derived ingredients with a variety of biological activities, particularly antioxidant and pH-sensitive properties. Green tea is rich in gallic acid, catechin, and other phenolic compounds, which result in the excellent antioxidant capacity of a green tea extract (GTE) [4]. Siripatrawan et al. reported that chitosan films mixed with GTE showed high levels of free radical scavenging activity [5]. Chitosan is a functional biopolymer with intrinsic antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which consequently has a high potential for use in biodegradable active packaging. As a source of polyphenols, GTE can be used as an active agent and incorporated into films. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop an eco-friendly active film from chitosan incorporated with an aqueous GTE as a natural antioxidant. As mentioned above, biodegradable active packaging is the main focus of current food packaging research and development. Recently, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been widely used as a water-soluble film for packaging [6] because of its low cost, good mechanical strength, and biodegradability [7]. This plant extract was incorporated into PVA in order to develop a food packaging film with an enhanced strength and antioxidant activity. Owing to the good biological activities of GTE, a combination of GTE and PVA may have a beneficial effect on the biological characteristics of blend films. The use of the green tea as a potential natural additive to enhance the antioxidant activity and pH-sensitivity of biocomposite film remains to be studied. In this study, novel food packaging materials with good mechanical and antioxidant activities were developed. A GTE-PVA biocomposite film was made into a film and characterized. The relationship between the GTE content and the microstructure, physical properties, antioxidant activity, and pH-sensitivity of the biocomposite film was investigated. The GTE-PVA biocomposite film was found to be suitable for potential exploitation in the food packaging industry and optimized."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Green tea (500 g) was purchased from Ito En Ltd (Japan). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with a molecular weight (Mw) of 14.6 kDa, gallic acid (99%), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reagent, the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ), ferric chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, acetic acid (99%), glycerol, ethanol (99%), sodium carbonate, and potassium persulfate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Japan). Deionized water (DI water) and a vent filter for PE Tank (Type 2 Water) was used for solution preparation and dilution. All reagents were of analytical grade and used as received, without further purification."
3,GTE-PVA composite film preparation,"2.2 GTE-PVA composite film preparation Green tea leaves (20 g) were immersed in DI water (500 mL) at room temperature for 24 h. The wet green tea leaves were then crushed using a super masscolloider (12 × 100 rpm, 8 times) in water. The resulting dispersion of green tea leaves was freeze-dried for 2 days to obtain the green tea extract (GTE) powder. The total phenol content in GTE was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. PVA powder (4 g) was added to DI water (36 g) and stirred at 90 °C for 12 h to obtain a 10 wt% PVA solution. The PVA solution was mixed with different concentrations (2 wt%, 5 wt%, and 10 wt%) of GTE. Then, 10 wt% of glycerol was added to the GTE-PVA mixture as a plasticizer. The film-forming solutions were poured into petri dishes, and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were obtained after oven drying at 50 °C for 2 days."
4,Measurements,"2.3 Measurements 2.3.1 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements of the sample were performed using a Nicolet iS5 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) equipped with an iD5 ATR attachment. The FT-IR spectra of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were recorded from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 at a resolution of 1 cm−1 using an FT-IR spectrometer. 2.3.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Surface and cross-sectional micrographs of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SU3500; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage (15 kV) at 500 × magnification. Before analysis, the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were dried, fractured with liquid nitrogen, and coated with a gold layer using MSP-1S (Vacuum Device Inc., Tokyo, Japan). 2.3.3 Film thickness A digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Osaka, Japan) with a resolution of 0.001 mm in the range of 0 mm–45 mm was used to measure the thickness of the films. The thickness of each film was measured at 10 random positions, and the average thickness of each film was calculated, as per a previously reported method [8]. 2.3.4 Water contact angle The static contact angles of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were determined using a Drop Master DM300 (Kyowa Interface Science, Saitama, Japan). A water droplet (1.0 μL) was dropped onto the surface of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films (1 cm × 4 cm), and the contact angle of each film was determined in five different positions at 5 s (scanning time) after the attachment of the droplet in 0 min and after 5 min. The average values have been reported. 2.3.5 Opacity characteristics The opacity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the GTE-PVA composite film samples (1 cm × 4 cm) at 600 nm with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (U-2810, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), according to a previously reported method [9–11]. Eq. (1) was used to estimate the opacity of each film: (1) O p a c i t y = A b s 600 x where Abs600 is the absorbance of the film samples at 600 nm and x is the film thickness (mm). According to this equation, high opacity values indicate lower transmittance."
5,Moisture content,"2.4 Moisture content Each GTE-PVA biocomposite film was cut into 2 × 2 cm sections and the initial weight was measured. Then, the films were dried at 110 °C for 24 h. The moisture content was determined by drying the film sample to a constant weight [12]. After obtaining the dry weight, the moisture content (MC) of the film was calculated using Eq. (2): (2) M o i s t u r e c o n t e n t ( % ) = M i − M t M i × 100 where M i and M t are the weights of the film sample before (i) and after (t) drying."
6,Water solubility,"2.5 Water solubility The GTE-PVA biocomposite films were cut into 2 cm × 2 cm sections and weighed. Then, the film sample was placed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) with continuous stirring at room temperature [13]. After 24 h, the undissolved film samples were removed and dried to a constant weight at 110 °C. The water solubility (WS) of the film was calculated using Eq. (3): (3) W a t e r s o l u b i l i t y ( % ) = M d × ( 1 − MC ) − M f M d × ( 1 − MC ) × 100 where M d and M f denote the initial and final weights of the film sample, respectively. MC denotes the moisture content in the film sample obtained in Eq. (2)."
7,Water vapor permeability,"2.6 Water vapor permeability Fig. S1 shows the apparatus for measuring water vapor permeability of GTE-PVA biocomposite film. Each GTE-PVA biocomposite film sample with relative humidity of 50% was attached over a test tube (8 cm in depth and 4 cm in diameter), which was contained thoroughly dried silica gels. The film-covered test tube was weighed and maintained at 20 °C in a desiccator, and the film-covered test tube was weighed every 6 h for 3 consecutive days [14]. The water vapor permeability (WVP) was calculated using Eq. (4): (4) W V P = W × x A × ΔP × t where W is the weight of the test tube (g), x is the film thickness (m), t is the duration (s) of the increased weight of the test tube, A is the permeation area of the film sample (m2), and ΔP is the partial vapor pressure at 20 °C (2339 Pa)."
8,Mechanical properties,"2.7 Mechanical properties The GTE, PVA, and glycerol concentrations were considered as operational variables (denoted as A, B, and C), and the effect on the selected dependent variable, toughness (T), was calculated. The set of experiments followed the Box–Behnken design, a second-order, incomplete, factorial design [15]. The experiment design was statistically analyzed using the Design Expert® 10.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MA, USA). The model was validated through multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA). T was calculated as the area under the stress-strain curve per specimen volume, using Eq. (5). The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of the GTE-PVA composite film were established by tensile testing of the GTE-PVA composite films performed in a universal testing machine (EZ Graph, Shimadzu, Japan) [16]. (5) T o u g h n e s s = Energy V o l u m e (6) T e n s i l e s t r e n g t h ( M P a ) = F x × W (7) E l o n g a t i o n a t b r e a k ( % ) = Δ L L 0 × 100 where F is the stress for film fracture (N), x is the film thickness (mm), W is the film width (mm), and ΔL and L 0 are the elongated and initial lengths (mm) of the film, respectively."
9,Thermal stability,"2.8 Thermal stability The GTE-PVA biocomposite film samples were tested on a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) instrument TG/DTA 200 (Exstar, Woodland, California) by heating from 45 °C to 500 °C under nitrogen protection. The heating rate was set at 10 °C min−1."
10,Antioxidant property of the GTE-PVA composite films,"2.9 Antioxidant property of the GTE-PVA composite films 2.9.1 Total phenolic content The total phenolic content (TPC) of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films was estimated using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent reduction associated with a change in color from yellow to blue [8,17]. The GTE-PVA biocomposite films were prepared by soaking in 2.5 mL ethanol and mixed with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (0.3 mL, 10% v/v) and 2 mL of 7.5% (w/v) sodium carbonate solution. After 15 min, the absorbance of the mixture was measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Gallic acid (GA) was used as the reference and the standard curve was obtained for 0 ppm–1000 ppm of GA. TPC was calculated as a microgram GA equivalent per unit gram weight of the film. 2.9.2 Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) FeCl3 solution (0.02 M) was mixed with the TPTZ solution (0.04 M, in HCl) and sodium acetate trihydrate solution (pH 3.6) at a 10:1:1 ratio. The FRAP assay solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The prepared ethanol extract of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films (150 μL) was added to the FRAP assay solution (2850 μL). This mixture was incubated for 15 min in the dark. UV–Vis spectrophotometry was performed at 595 nm and the standard curve was obtained using GA as the reference at a concentration of 0 ppm–1000 ppm. The FRAP activity was calculated in terms of a microgram GA equivalent per unit gram weight of the film. 2.9.3 DPPH radical scavenging assay DPPH assay is an easy and rapid method to evaluate the antioxidant content of films [18]. The dose-dependent and time-dependent antioxidant ability of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films was evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging assay. For dose-dependent antioxidant measurements, different amounts of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films (4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, and 20 mg) were added to DPPH ethanol solution (100 μM, 4 mL). After incubation in the dark for 1.5 h, the absorbance of the reaction solution was measured using an Infinite® 200 (TECAN, Männedorf, Zürich, Switzerland) at 517 nm. For time-dependent antioxidant measurements, the GTE-PVA biocomposite films (20 mg) were added to a DPPH ethanol solution (100 μM, 4 mL). The absorbance of the reaction solution was measured for 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, and 60 min using an Infinite® 200 (TECAN, Männedorf, Zürich, Switzerland) at 517 nm. The % DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated using Eq. (8): (8) S c a v e n g i n g ( % ) = Abs ( control ) − Abs ( sample ) Abs ( control ) × 100 where Abs (control) and Abs (sample) indicate the absorbance of the blank and the reaction solution, respectively."
11,pH-sensitivity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"2.10 pH-sensitivity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films To determine the pH response of the GTE-PVA biocomposite film, it was exposed to different buffer solutions (pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) for 30 min. Then, the samples were evaluated using a UV spectrometer (U-2810, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) by scanning the sample from 400 nm to 700 nm."
12,Results and discussion,
13,FT-IR spectra of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"3.1 FT-IR spectra of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films The FT-IR spectra of the pure PVA, the GTE, and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films have been shown in Fig. 1 . GTE absorption bands were observed at 1350 cm−1, 1444 cm−1, and 1650 cm−1, in which 1350 cm−1 and 1444 cm−1 were attributed to a C–H stretching and 1650 cm−1 was attributed to a CC stretching. In contrast, the absorption bands of PVA were observed at 3280 cm−1, 2917 cm−1, 1425 cm−1, 1324 cm−1, and 1081 cm−1 [19]. These peaks were attributed to an O–H stretching of the hydroxyl group, CH2 asymmetric stretching, CO carbonyl stretching, C–H stretching of CH2, C–H stretching, C–O stretching of acetyl groups, and C–C stretching. For the GTE-PVA composite film, the hydroxyl stretching region in the range of 3500 cm−1-3000 cm−1 and the C–O stretching region in the range of 1300 cm−1-1000 cm−1 were relatively sensitive to compositional changes. Notably, some changes occurred in the band position and peak intensity for the GTE-PVA biocomposite films."
14,"Microstructure, thickness, and water contact angle of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films","3.2 Microstructure, thickness, and water contact angle of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films Fig. 2 a-d shows the surface images of the pure PVA film and each GTE-PVA biocomposite films, which have good transparency and no impurities. It indicated that PVA and GTE have no phase separate during the mixing process. The cross-sectional microstructure images of biocomposite films observed by SEM (Fig. 2e–h). In general, the pictures of surfaces and cross-sections of the films in SEM were smooth and uniform, indicating that PVA, GTE, and glycerol were homogenously mixed. The thickness of the PVA film and GTE-PVA biocomposite films has been summarized in Table 1 . The thickness of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films significantly increased with an increase in the GTE content. All the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were thicker than the pure PVA control film, and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films containing 10% GTE showed a maximum thickness increment ratio of 15%. GTE-PVA biocomposite films were significantly increased than pure PVA film. This increase was caused by the presence of GTE droplets between the PVA polymer chains. Water contact angle tests were used to determine the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the film surface. The static contact angles of the pure PVA film control film and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films have been summarized in Table 1. The results indicated that the hydrophobicity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films increased as the GTE concentration increased. The significant increase in the contact angles of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films was attributed to the inclusion of polyphenolic compounds contained in the GTE, which led to a decrease in the hydrophilicity of the film."
15,Physical appearance and color of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"3.3 Physical appearance and color of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films Opacity and light transmittance are critical properties for the film applications, particularly in the use of film to improve product appearance. Opacity value corresponds to a higher visible light absorbance of a film sample at a given thickness. As shown in Table 2 , the opacity values of pure PVA, 2% GTE-PVA, 5% GTE-PVA and 10% GTE-PVA biocomposite films were 0.6%, 1.8%, 2.8% and 3.4%, respectively. Opacity values, associated with the appearance and color of the films and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films was significantly higher than that of the pure PVA film. Light transmittance indicates the ability of the film to absorb light and the values of the different composite films at 400–800 nm wavelengths are shown in Fig. 3 . With the increase of GTE concentrations in the film blends, the transparency of the films decreased. In contrast, the GTE-PVA biocomposite films showed good barrier properties against UV light because of the UV absorption ability of the phenolic compounds in GTE. This result may have been due to the hydrogen bonding between GTE and PVA, which increased the density of the films, reduced the amount of penetration of the incident light, and then decreased the light transmittance."
16,"Moisture content, water solubility, and water vapor permeability","3.4 Moisture content, water solubility, and water vapor permeability As shown in Table 3 , compared with the pure PVA film, the biocomposites containing 2%, 5%, and 10% GTE showed a significant reduction in the moisture content. Moreover, the moisture content of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films decreased as the GTE concentration increased. These results indicated that the decrease in moisture content of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films was due to the inclusion of the hydrophobic components of GTE, which decreased the water absorption capacity of the film. The water solubility of the pure PVA film and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films has been summarized in Table 3. It followed the same trend as that observed in the moisture content studies. The GTE-PVA biocomposite films containing 2%, 5%, and 10% GTE showed a substantial decrease in water solubility compared with that exhibited by the pure PVA film. Several studies have reported that strong interactions between phenolic compounds and PVA chains decrease the availability of the hydroxyl groups of the polymer for water interaction [20,21]. Therefore, the decrease in the water solubility of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films indicated a strong cohesion between the GTE and PVA. Indeed, it has been found that most of the natural and synthetic biocomposites show remarkably extended shelf life during long-term storage. Fig. S2 proved that GTE-PVA biocomposite films have a good stability during a long-term storage. The WVP value reflects the ability to prevent moisture transfer in films. As shown in Table 3, the GTE-PVA composite films exhibited lower WVP values than those exhibited by the pure PVA film. Moreover, the WVP value of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films gradually decreased when the GTE content increased from 2 wt% to 10 wt%. The WVP of the active film was also affected by the interaction and uniform distribution of the GTE, temperature, humidity, and plasticizer concentration. In addition, the bulky aromatic in the skeleton of tea polyphenol could obstruct the inner networks of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films and reduce the water vapor affinity of the films. This decrease in WVP values was also reported when chitosan film was incorporated with carvacrol extract and apple polyphenol [22–24]."
17,Mechanical properties of the pure PVA film and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"3.5 Mechanical properties of the pure PVA film and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films The response surface describing the effect of the concentration of GTE, PVA, and glycerol on toughness has been shown in Fig. 4 . Increasing the PVA concentration increased the toughness values at lower GTE concentrations, indicating that the functional group of PVA played the role of a plasticizer, that is it enhanced the toughness of the developed GTE-PVA biocomposite films via carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. This behavior demonstrated that the formation between the GTE and PVA chains allowed for the sliding of the polymer chains during the mechanical test, thus improving their ability to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films. However, the toughness decreased with an increasing glycerol concentration. A negative effect on the toughness was found for the GTE-PVA biocomposite films when the concentration of glycerol was over 15%, because its interaction with GTE-PVA-glycerol reduced the direct interaction among cellulose chains, reducing the toughness properties. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the pure PVA control film and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films have been summarized in Table 4 . The GTE-PVA biocomposite films showed a higher tensile strength than that exhibited by the pure PVA film. In addition, the tensile strength of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films gradually increased with an increased GTE content. The increase in the tensile strength of the film containing GTE may be due to the hydrogen bond formed between the hydroxyl groups of the PVA and the polyphenols in the GTE, with similar improvements of the mechanical properties previously observed in the CS-green tea extract films [5]. As shown in Table 4, the EAB of the GTE-PVA biocomposite film gradually increased with an increased GTE content, indicating that GTE could significantly increase the flexibility of the GTE-PVA composite films."
18,Thermal properties of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"3.6 Thermal properties of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films Thermal analyses of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were performed to determine the effect of GTE on the thermal stability and morphology of the polymer. As shown in Fig. 5 , the GTE thermogram showed a broad degradation band that started at 150 °C, with a maximum at approximately 200 °C. Part of the catechin from the GTE was glycosylated, and these sugars were “caramelized” during heating. The partial degradation of the catechins, leading to the formation of gallic acid, and the polymerization of phenols, may also be related to this transition [25]. This degradation was observed over a wide range of temperatures, and the last stage, from 340 °C, was caused by the tea cellulose in GTE. The TGA of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films demonstrated that degradation occurred in three stages. The first stage, within the temperature range of 35°C–110 °C, corresponded to the dehydration of moisture and physiosorbed water molecules on the films. The second stage (110°C–230 °C) was caused by the tea polyphenols and the main intermolecular hydrogen bonding degradation of PVA. The third stage (230°C–360 °C) comprised the breakage of tea cellulose and the intramolecular chain degradation of PVA. The final stage (360°C–500 °C) comprised the cleavage of the C–C backbone of the PVA polymer and the production of carbon molecules and hydrocarbons. Notably, GTE-PVA film presented relatively lower weight loss than pure PVA film, suggesting the incorporation of GTE could enhance the thermal stability."
19,Antioxidant ability of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"3.7 Antioxidant ability of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films Tea polyphenols in GTE, such as catechins and gallic acid, show good free radical scavenging activities due to the presence of multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups [5]. Thus, the incorporation of GTE into food packaging films can considerably enhance the antioxidant activity of films to protect food from an oxidative damage. Gallic acid, is one of the major phenolic compounds in GTE and can be used as the standard for TPC measurement. As shown in Fig. 6 a, TPC was used as a preliminary antioxidant assessment for the pure PVA control film and the GTE-PVA biocomposite films with different levels of GTE content. The result has been attributed to the incorporation of GTE in the film. The FRAP assay is used to determine the antioxidant activity of films based on their ability to reduce ferric (III) iron into ferrous (II) iron. The GTE-PVA biocomposite films showed a substantial improvement in terms of their iron reduction capacity, with the level of FRAP activity increasing with the increasing GTE levels (Fig. 6b). The dose-dependent and time-dependent antioxidant abilities of the films have been shown in Fig. 6c and d. When the GTE content was increased from 2 wt% to 10 wt% on a PVA basis, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite film was found to increase gradually. When the film equivalent reached 5 mg mL−1, the DPPH radical scavenging activities of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films containing 2% 5%, and 10% GTE were 32.2%, 39.7%, and 52.9%, respectively. As presented in Fig. 6d, all the films showed time-dependent DPPH radical scavenging activities. The results showed that the GTE-PVA biocomposite films were comprised as follows: 10% GTE >5 GTE-PVA biocomposite film containing 5% GTE > GTE-PVA composite film containing 2% GTE > pure PVA film."
20,pH sensitivity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films,"3.8 pH sensitivity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films Color was used as an indication of the sensitivity of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films to changes in the pH, due to the structural transformations of tea polyphenols, in which catechin plays an important role. Catechin was converted into semiquinone after immersion in a buffer (pH > 7) (Fig. 7 a). At the same time, the color of the GTE-PVA biocomposite films changed to reddish-brown. When the pH of the solution was under 7, the film color (yellowish-green) was almost negligible; however, with an increase in the pH value, the film color became reddish-brown. The pH of the aqueous catechin was acidic and contained many hydroxyl groups, more than that in the GTE. The hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group was found to have a different dissociation when found at different positions. Therefore, when the pH of the solution was 7, the required NaOH equivalent was greater than 7, such that the color of the GTE-PVA composite films was different from that at pH 7 (Fig. 7b). As shown in Fig. 7c, the pH-sensitive GTE-PVA biocomposite films could be used as pH indicators to monitor the freshness of food products, based on changes in the color of the films."
21,Conclusions,"In this study, we developed an active food packaging film using GTE biomass compounded with PVA. The SEM images obtained indicated that PVA, GTE, and glycerol were homogenously mixed in the GTE-PVA biocomposite films established in this study. The tensile strength and surface hydrophobicity of the biocomposite films were found to increase with an increasing concentration of GTE. The increased concentration of GTE caused a significant reduction in the water solubility, water vapor permeability, and elongation at break of the established films. The GTE-PVA biocomposite films showed superior UV–vis light barrier properties compared to those exhibited by pure PVA control films. This characteristic may be attributed to the UV absorption ability of the phenolic compounds in GTE, a property that can be used to protect food from UV light. Owing to the abundant phenolics found in GTE, the GTE-PVA biocomposite films showed high levels of antioxidant activity and pH-sensitive abilities. The antioxidant assessment of the GTE films also confirmed an observable increase in their antioxidant activity compared to those observed in pure PVA films. Considering all the physical and functional properties, the GTE-PVA biocomposite films may be used in the future as a degradable and antibacterial active packaging material in the food industry and beyond."
