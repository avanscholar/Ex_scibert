0,Introduction,"The direct transformation of aldehydes to esters under mild conditions is a useful catalytic process in organic synthesis. The conventional synthesis process of esters involves oxidation and esterification two-step reactions of alcohols along with formation of toxic wastes and byproducts [1]. From the viewpoint of green chemistry, the direct transformation of aldehydes with alcohols is a more environmentally friendly procedure. The oxidative esterification reactions of aldehydes to esters have been achieved in a variety of ways, electrochemical oxidation [2], or through the use of metal oxidants and transition metals [3–8]. Recently, such transformations also have been achieved with catalyst such as V2O5, IrCl(cod)]2, etc. [9–12]. Although several methods have been reported for the direct preparation of aldehydes to esters, those processes usually require a large amount of reagents, extremes of temperature, lengthy reaction times, poisonous and polluting reagents, etc. Pd catalysts are used extensively in selective oxidation or oxygenation reaction [13–17]. A synthesis process for direct methyl esterification of aldehydes with alcohols to corresponding esters with the Pb, Mg-doped Al2O3-supported Pd crystal as catalyst has been developed in our laboratory, and the reactions produce water as only by-product [18] (Scheme 1 ). The reactions were found to be highly stereoselective to provide the esters in good yields, and it is also interesting to found that metal Pb had positive effect on reaction rate acceleration and selectivity enhancement in the presence of oxygen or not. In the previous research works, a possible oxidative esterification mechanism was proposed [6,19,20]. The reaction providing esters of aldehydes with alcohols was considered to proceed through the oxidative addition of metal species on the oxygen–hydrogen bond of alcohol to give an alkoxide. The attack of the resulting alkoxy group on the aldehyde carbonyl coordinated to the metal took place to afford a metal-bound hemiacetal intermediate, which undergoes further dehydrogenation (β-hydrogen elimination as an oxidation process) in delivering the ester. With assumption of the formation of intermediate hemiacetal, the oxidative condensation of aldehydes with alcohols can be performed to afford esters. However, relationships between the catalytic activity and structures of catalyst surfaces have not been well understood, and to our knowledge, little information on the detailed mechanism is known from the theoretical point of view. In the last few years, the developments of computational chemistry have made the investigations of realistic catalytic systems with theoretical approach feasible and reliable. The metallic systems Pd have been the focus of many studies because they play a great role in heterogeneous catalysis. Various theoretical researches have been carried out on Pd clusters with different size and Pd surfaces under various conditions [21–27]. The adsorption structures, energies and characters of representative molecules on Pd, such as alcohol [28,29], CO, O2 [30–32], as well as unsaturated hydrocarbons (ethylene [33], benzene [34], butadiene [35], etc.), have been covered with a large range of theoretical approaches. There are also reactivity and path investigations for different reactions, such as dissociation of H2, O2 and hydrogenolysis of compound on the Pd clusters and surfaces [36–39], and these studies show importance in confirm or discard hypothesis concerning structure and reactivity. The detailed direct transformation mechanism of methyl methacrylate (MMA) by methacrolein (MAL) with methanol on Pd catalyst was investigated by DFT calculation in this work as an attempt to gain more insight into the oxidative esterification mechanism and reactivity. MMA is important industry material used in manufacture of polymethyl methacrylate acrylic and polyvinyl chloride, and its synthesis has been carried out in our past experimental work [18]. As a small part of whole researches, what we did in this work is to model main line of reaction mechanism without oxygen. We hope that these results are useful and provide basis for works on influence of catalyst and reaction mechanism with oxygen. We have explored alternative paths and computed the activation energies of the various possible elementary steps, i.e., the activation of methanol to supply adsorbed methoxyl and co-product hydrogen structures, the attack of methoxy group and hydrogen on the different sites of MAL, the hydrogen eliminations of MAL following by reactions with methoxyl, the formation of possible intermediates including hemiacetal, the supposed subsequent β-hydrogen elimination to afford MMA, and the formation of by-product including saturated aldehyde and unsaturated alcohol found in our experiment works [18]. The structures of intermediates and transition states involved in these processes were determined, and the relative energies of these species were calculated. The different reaction paths were examined to discern which steps are feasible and appear to be an energetically favorable in catalytic cycle. We are interested mainly in the qualitative trends that can provide helpful information on the understanding of the elementary steps of direct methyl esterification for MMA."
1,Computational details,"Structure optimizations and energy calculations were carried out with the doubled numerical basis set with d-polarization functions and the generalized gradient corrected functional by Perdew and Wang (PW91) [40]. The mesh size in medium quality for the numerical integration was used, and the tolerances of energy, gradient and displacement convergence were 2×10−5 au, 4×10−3 au/Å and 5×10−3 Å, and the real space cutoff of atomic orbital was set at 4.0Å. Complete linear synchronous transit and quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) calculations were performed to determine the structures of transition states, confirmed by additional calculations of the intrinsic reaction path. The corresponding frequencies were computed at the same level in order to check the obtained stationary points to be ground states (minimum structures) with only real frequencies, or to be transition states (maximum structures or saddle points) with only one imaginary frequency displaying the desired displacements orientation and connection. The bare cluster calculations were performed spin unrestricted as past theory investigation [36]. The most favorable spin multiplicity of the cluster and cluster-adsorbate were determined by performing a series of calculations with different spin states to find the lowest energy state. The discussions are based on the energies of activation (ΔE ‡) and reaction (ΔE), and the ZPE corrections have been taken into account for all the cited energies. All calculations were carried out with the DMol program package in the Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc. In the theoretical calculations there are two major strategies commonly used to model a surface, the cluster approaches and the periodic supercell. For Pd, both of clusters and periodic supercell model were used widely. The cluster model approach is thought to capture the essential features and to be able to predict local properties such as geometries and vibrational frequencies quite well [41]. The calculations performed using clusters models of the Pd surfaces, such as Pd22 cluster exhibiting Pd (111) surface for CO adsorption [31], Pd18 and Pd19 cluster models of the Pd (111) surface for hydrogenolysis of acetate [36], appear to be reasonable and compare fairly well with periodic slab calculation results. A 20-metal-atom Pd (12, 8) cluster model was used in our calculations, and it is composed of two metal layers and mainly exhibits Pd (100) surface. The top layer of the cluster was allowed to relax with the adsorbed molecule and group, while the bottom layer was constrained to the bulk interatomic distances. In the text, R is used to for reactants, P for products, INT for intermediates, and TS for the transition states, respectively."
2,Results and discussion,"The conformation and characters of adsorbed complexes including unsaturated hydrocarbons and alcohol over Pd clusters or surfaces were objectives of some previous theoretical studies as mentioned above, and various coordination structures were proposed and discussed [31–33]. In our test calculations, different adsorption conformations for methacrolein (MAL) and methanol on Pd20 cluster were investigated and compared. The adsorption character is not object of our investigation in this work, so only two kinds of energy minimum adsorption modes (as shown in Fig. 1 ), η 2 for methanol and η 4 for MAL, were chosen for the reaction path calculations. The structural data of PdH and PdO bonds in optimized modes are given in Table 1 . The conformations are corresponding with past theoretical results of similar molecules [28,36,42], and the calculated binding energy, −69kJ/mol for methanol and −140kJ/mol for MAL, also appear to be a reasonable estimate (the binding energy was calculated by following equation [35]: Δ E bind = E ads − E reactant − E surface . Based on the adsorption structure of methanol in Fig. 1, the calculations for the initiating OH bond breaking reaction of methanol to form surface-bound methoxyl and hydrogen were carried out. The methanol on Pd surface is thought to dissociate into methoxy species and adsorbed atomic hydrogen [29,43]. The hydrogen is supposed to exist as PdH form that was investigated by the previous experimental and theoretical works, and our calculation results are consistent with their findings [44–47]. The formations of methoxy group and hydrogen in the reaction process were also confirmed by our experimental IR spectra results. The results of all calculations will be given as energies diagrams on which are represented the geometries of the intermediates (INT) and transition states (TS). The potential energy surface along the breakage of methanol is computed, and the transition state TS(m) connecting methanol (R(m)) and P(m) was located and shown in Fig. 2 . No matter for methoxyl, or hydrogen, there are various possible adsorption modes. In our calculations, the structures with bridge adsorption modes for both of them are more stable with low energy. Actually, the bridge adsorption of hydrogen on Pd surface has been investigated in detail by theory works [45,46]. The O⋯H and Pd⋯H distances in TS(m) are 1.780 and 1.621Å, respectively. The activation energy of this step is 66.5kJ/mol, and the reaction to the product P(m) with surface-bound methoxyl and PdH bond is endergonic by 41.1kJ/mol. The distances of PdH and PdO in P(m) were given in Table 1. In the presence of resulting methoxy group and hydrogen, surface-bound MAL can undergo a number of different possible reaction pathways. These include the attack of methoxy group, hydrogen addition and the hydrogen eliminations of MAL: (a) the attack of the methoxyl on the aldehyde carbonyl of MAL; (b) the attack of the methoxyl on the unsaturated CC bond; (c) hydrogen addition to the CO bond of MAL; (d) hydrogen addition to the CC bond; (e) hydrogen elimination of aldehyde carbonyl of MAL; (f) hydrogen elimination of CC bond. In this work, we computed all the possible paths for comparison, and these paths are investigated in the form of surface-bound MAL with successive adsorption of methoxyl or hydrogen in the neighborhood. In the actual circumstances, a catalytic cycle will include adsorptions, desorption and reactions. It is very hard to give a detailed description and comparison for all the actions while some pathways probably involve three or four free radicals (two hydrogens and two methoxyls). So, the adsorption processes and energies for methoxyl or hydrogen will not be considered in this work. Only the reaction pathways and energies will be discussed with the assumptions of successive adsorptions of radicals and molecules. The initial starting structure for each step is determined based on its distance along the linear path between the reaction site of MAL and methoxyl (or hydrogen), and the adsorption mode is expected to be the most favorable for the taking place of reaction."
3,(a) Reaction of the methoxyl with aldehyde carbonyl of MAL,"3.1 (a) Reaction of the methoxyl with aldehyde carbonyl of MAL The methoxy group would probably react with two sites of MAL, aldehyde carbonyl and CC bond. The two calculated possible routes of methoxyl with different intermediates and products are shown in Scheme 2 . The route along the attack of methoxy group to aldehyde carbonyl was computed firstly, and energies diagrams of two possible pathways for the route are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. Following the LST/QST procedure, the transition state labeled TS1(a) connecting the initiating reactant R1(a) that is with an adsorbed methoxy nearby MAL and intermediate INT1(a) was located and showed in Fig. 3. The OC distance between methoxy O and carbonyl C of TS1(a) is 2.643Å. The activation energy of this elementary step is 42.9kJ/mol, and the reaction is endergonic by 34.6kJ/mol. As for INT1(a), it could be actually regarded as an adsorbed analogous hemiacetal radical structure, and a further hydrogen addition will lead the formation of the complete hemiacetal intermediate which probably to undergo hydrogen elimination to afford MMA. However, the reiterated hydrogen addition and elimination process inspire us to consider the direct hydrogen elimination mechanism of INT1(a) at same time. So, both of hydrogen addition and elimination of INT1(a) were computed. The hydrogen addition path shown in Fig. 4 to form hemiacetal is discussed firstly, while the direct hydrogen elimination path is shown in Fig. 3 together with the attacking step of methoxyl as a continuous energy process. To simplify the hydrogen addition calculation, it is reasonable to use directly an intermediate INT2(a) which is INT1(a) with one more absorbed hydrogen close to the carbonyl C without considering the process of methanol breakage once again, and this structure also enables the H to transfer within the shortest distance. Since the adsorption of one more H will lead the discontiguous energy change, energies for the elementary steps are given independently in Fig. 4 and the corresponding value of reactant INT2(a) is set to 0.0kJ/mol. The reaction pathway connecting INT2(a) and INT3(a) (hemiacetal) was searched and shown in Fig. 4, and the transition state TS3(a) was located. The O⋯H and Pd⋯H distances in TS3(a) are 1.478 and 1.774Å, respectively, and the calculated barrier is 79.6kJ/mol. The hydrogen elimination of hemiacetal to form MMA would be along with two possible pathways, the reverse reaction of the hydrogen addition (with 75.0kJ/mol activation energy as shown in Fig. 4) and β-hydrogen elimination. In order to permit the hemiacetal β-hydrogen elimination leading to the formation of MMA, a conformation displacement of β-hydrogen in INT3(a) with change of stretch direction is required (shown in Fig. 4). This displacement needs a rotating of β-hydrogen to shorten the distance to the Pd surface. This step takes activation energy of 17.9kJ/mol, and the energy decreasing along with this conformation change is very small (−5.2kJ/mol). Starting from conformation changed product INT3″(a), the β-hydrogen elimination will cost 34.5kJ/mol activation energy, and give an adsorbed INT4(a) structure. A transition structure for this step was found with C⋯H and Pd⋯H distances being 2.009 and 1.657Å, respectively. The further hydrogen elimination of INT4(a) will lead to the formation of final product MMA, and the reaction path is shown separately in Fig. 5 for the energy discontinuousness. The activation energy (7.5kJ/mol) for second H elimination is much smaller than that of first. As for the direct β-hydrogen elimination of INT1(a) to produce MMA, a similar conformation displacement of β-hydrogen with hemiacetal is required (as shown in Fig. 3) in order to permit the reaction. This step takes activation energy of 37.8kJ/mol, and the energy increases 3.3kJ/mol. Starting from conformation changed product INT1′(a), the β-hydrogen elimination would lead to the formation of P(a)I with the adsorbed MMA. The reaction steps and energies are also shown in Fig. 3. A transition structure was found with C⋯H and Pd⋯H distances being 1.526 and 1.739Å, respectively. The activation energy cost for this step is 33.5kJ/mol, and it is exergonic. Comparing with the direct β-hydrogen elimination of hemiacetal radical, the formation and hydrogen elimination of hemiacetal takes more activation energy (79.6kJ/mol) and would be more difficult to take place."
4,(b) Reaction of the methoxyl with unsaturated CC bond of MAL,"3.2 (b) Reaction of the methoxyl with unsaturated CC bond of MAL Following the other possible pathway (b) of MAL shown in Scheme 2, the potential energy surface along the methoxyl reaction with unsaturated CC bond is also computed. The structure R1 in Fig. 3 is also starting points for the path (b), and the optimized structures of the involved species with energies are shown in Fig. 6 . The corresponding transition state TS1(b) for the attack of methoxyl to CC bond was located, and the C⋯O distances in the TS1(b) are 2.433Å. This step has a higher activation energy barrier of 63.0kJ/mol than methoxyl reaction with carbonyl, and the reaction energy is 1.4kJ/mol. A similar hydrogen elimination reaction of INT1(b) was considered for the same possibility as the hydrogen elimination in pathway (a). One hydrogen losing will lead to an unsaturated 3-methoxyl-methacrolein compound. The energy process was computed, while the involved optimized structures and the energies are shown in Fig. 6. The unsaturated aldehyde compound is not with energy advantage in its formation comparing with the product of hydrogen addition, and also not object product unlike MMA. These possible steps are also shown in Scheme 2. One more hydrogen addition of the INT1(b) will lead to the formation of the a 2-methyl-3-methoxyl-propylaldehyde compound through saturation of CC bond. Several test optimized calculations were carried out to search the adsorbed position of hydrogen that should be with minimum energy and favorable for taking place of reaction. Initiated with a structure INT2(b) with an adsorbed H on the most possible position beside CC bond, the hydrogen addition reaction was investigated and shown in Fig. 7 . The C⋯H and Pd⋯H distances in located transition state TS3(b) are 2.047 and 1.690Å, respectively. The possible final by-product propylaldehyde compound was obtained by this reaction. This step has an activation energy cost of 48.1kJ/mol and is exergonic (−8.8kJ/mol)."
5,(c) Hydrogen addition to the CO bond of MAL,"3.3 (c) Hydrogen addition to the CO bond of MAL The hydrogen addition to the CO bond of MAL will lead to formation of unsaturated alcohol. Following the proposed pathways in Scheme 3 , the potential energy surface along hydrogenation of CO bond was computed. Like explained above, since formation and adsorption process of H is not taken into account in this step, the energies for each elementary step are given independently and the corresponding value of reactant for each step is set to 0.0kJ/mol. As explained above, several possible structures were optimized to search the adsorbed position of hydrogen that should be favorable for hydrogen reaction with aldehyde carbonyl. The energy diagram for the reaction path is shown in Fig. 8 . The hydrogen reaction with nucleophilic O of CO bond will be prior comparing with C, and this assumption is confirmed by our test calculation (it will cost 101.6kJ/mol activation energy for hydrogen reaction with C). The hydrogen transformation process to O of CO bond from Pd surface was computed, and the transition state TS1(c) was found with 45.6kJ/mol activation energy. The O⋯H and Pd⋯H distances in TS1(c) are 1.610 and 1.659Å, respectively. The next step along this path is one more H transfer to aldehyde carbonyl which leads to the formation of alcohol coordinated to the Pd surface. The O⋯H and Pd⋯H distances of the transition state TS2(c) are 2.087 and 1.560Å, respectively. The computed activation energy of one more hydrogen addition is 104.1kJ/mol. This is a really high energy comparing with other step in catalytic cycle. The reaction is endergonic by 37.5kJ/mol."
6,(d) Hydrogen addition to the CC bond,"3.4 (d) Hydrogen addition to the CC bond The other H addition possibilities of MAL is to saturate the CC bond. The reaction calculations are following the path shown in Scheme 3, and involving structures with energies are shown in Fig. 9 . After carrying out a potential energy surface search initiated from a selected optimized structure with hydrogen on the most favorable position, we located an authentic transition state for the first hydrogen transformation process. The Pd⋯H distance between surface Pd and H of TS1(d) is 2.012Å, while the C⋯H distance is 1.547Å. The activation energy of this elementary step is 58.7kJ/mol, and the reaction is exergonic by −48.9kJ/mol. Based on the structure INT2(d) with one more hydrogen adsorbing near by the CC bond, the H attacking step to unsaturate C was computed, and transition state TS2(d) was located. The C⋯H and Pd⋯H in TS2(d) distances are 2.073 and 1.681Å, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9, the activation energy for the hydrogen transformation reaction is 64.5kJ/mol. The by-product saturated aldehyde will form by this pathway."
7,(e) Hydrogen elimination of the CHO group,"3.5 (e) Hydrogen elimination of the CHO group There is the possibility of hydrogen elimination for MAL to give different radical structures, then the radicals and methoxyl combining together to form products. The hydrogen elimination of CHO for MAL will give a CH2 C(CH3)CO acyl group. The pathway (e) along this reaction coordinate was computed, and the involved optimized structures with energies are shown in Fig. 10 . A potential energy surface search was carried out for the hydrogen elimination in MAL, we located an authentic transition state TS1(e) with 45.5kJ/mol activation energy. The Pd⋯H distance between surface Pd and H of TS1(e) is 1.680Å, while the C⋯H distance is 1.700Å. Based on the structure INT2(e) with adsorbing methoxyl near by the CH2 C(CH3)CO radical, the reaction between two radicals was computed, and transition state TS2(e) was found. The C⋯O distance between methoxy O and carbonyl C in TS2(e) is 2.544Å. As shown in Fig. 10, the activation energy for the methoxyl attacking reaction is 41.0kJ/mol. The final product MMA will form by this pathway shown in Scheme 4 . Comparing with the above attack reaction of methoxyl on CC bond with hydrogen elimination, the highest energy step of this path will cost 45.5kJ/mol activation energy and is competitive."
8,(f) Hydrogen elimination of the CC bond,"3.6 (f) Hydrogen elimination of the CC bond The hydrogen elimination of CC for MAL will give a CHC(CH3)CHO group. The optimized structures of the involved species for path(f) with energies are computed and shown in Fig. 11 . The corresponding transition state TS1(f) for the hydrogen elimination of CC double bond was found. The C⋯H and Pd⋯H in TS1(f) distances are 2.088 and 1.668Å, respectively. This step has a relative high activation energy barrier of 84.2kJ/mol, and the reaction energy is 32.8kJ/mol. The following reaction of intermediate with methoxyl will lead to formation of an unsaturated 3-methoxyl-methacrolein compound as path(b). The corresponding transition state TS2(f) for the attack of methoxyl to CC bond was located, and the C⋯O distances in the TS2(f) are 2.141Å. The activation energy of this elementary step is 67.7kJ/mol, and the reaction is exergonic by −35.8kJ/mol. Several above paths with different intermediates for oxidative esterification of MAL to MMA would be analyzed here. The computed energies of activation and reaction for the individual steps are listed in Table 2 . The cleavage of methanol is starting and essential step of MMA catalytic cycle. The activation energy for break of OH structure in methanol on Pd cluster is 66.5kJ/mol, while the computed bond dissociation energy of OH bond in CH3OH is 451.7kJ/mol (The BDE was calculated by following equation: BDE (R1–R2)=[E (R1)+ E (R2)]− E (R1–R2), and the experimental value is 104.2±0.9kcal/mol (435.8kJ/mol) [48]). Obviously, one of the critical roles of Pd catalyst is promoting the formation of methoxyl and initiate whole catalytic cycle. In several possible radical attacking paths, route (a) and (b) start with the attack of methoxyl, while other routes start with the addition or elimination of hydrogen. On the basis of the computed data, these pathways were compared and discussed to find a favored route. As shown in Scheme 2, in the path (a), the reaction of CO group with methoxyl needs lower activation energy (42.9kJ/mol) than that of unsaturated CC bond (63.0kJ/mol) in the path (b) at the beginning of reaction cycle. In the following steps of formed analogous hemiacetal radical structure in path (a), the further hydrogenation of aldehyde carbonyl to form exact hemiacetal intermediate will cost higher activation energy (79.6kJ/mol) than direct β-hydrogen elimination (33.5kJ/mol). Although a conformation change is needed firstly, the direct hydrogen elimination of the hemiacetal radical is the favorable pathway to give MMA. It is interesting to see from Fig. 3 that the total energy of the TS increases in a stepwise manner along the reaction coordinate while the reaction process is endothermic in pathway(a). The attack of methoxyl on CO group in pathway(a) is more difficult from a thermodynamic point of view. The attack of methoxyl on unsaturated CC bond in route (b) will probably lead to the formation of propylaldehyde compound. The following further H addition, or H elimination of its intermediate are with activation energies more than 50kJ/mol, while TS2(b) is with 64.0kJ/mol relative energy comparing with starting point. Based on the energy data of two hydrogen addition pathways (c) and (d) shown in Scheme 3, it could be seen that the reaction of CO group with hydrogen will be more feasible with lower activating energy cost (45.6kJ/mol) than that of CC bond (58.7kJ/mol). The second H transformations are more difficult in both case of CO and CC bond with unsaturated alcohol or saturated aldehyde as final product. In general, the reactions of CO are found to be prior to that of CC bond in catalyst cycle by calculations. As for the two kinds of hydrogen elimination reactions of MAL pathways (e) and (f), the hydrogen elimination of CHO have obvious advantage with 45.5kJ/mol activation energy. It is more important that the following attack of methoxyl on acyl group costs a low energy to form the MMA. Comparing the above different pathways, it could be found that attack of methoxyl, the hydrogen addition and elimination of CHO group have the similar energy barriers for the first step among all the paths investigated, and would be competitive in the beginning of catalyst reaction. However, the energy barrier for further hydrogenation of CO in path(c) to give the unsaturated alcohol is 104.1kJ/mol, which is the largest among all the paths computed and larger than the allover barrier (72.4kJ/mol) of the path(a) for methoxyl reaction with CO bond. As the rate-determining step of path(c), the second hydrogen addition of CO will be difficult to take place. In general, the path(e) for the direct hydrogen elimination of CHO in MAL is with an energy advantage. On the basis of comparisons for these energy barriers, one could expect that the hydrogen elimination of MAL following methoxyl reaction with CO will be a favored reaction pathway, which will lead to the formation of MMA, while the completely formation of hemiacetal intermediate is less possible. Our analysis is confirmed by the reaction kinetics results of the direct methyl esterification reaction for MMA [49]. It is found that acyl group formed by decomposition of aldehyde and methoxy group are coupled to form MMA based on the reaction kinetic researches. Actually, there are not very big energy differences found for these pathways, so it will be advantageous to get ideal product by changing the reaction condition and modifying the catalyst. The further theory and experimental investigations into the scope, mechanism, and synthetic application of oxidative esterification reactions are currently carried out in our laboratory, including influences of oxygen and PdPb catalyst."
9,Conclusions,"The detailed reaction mechanisms for oxidative esterification process of methacrolein (MAL) with methanol to methyl methacrylate (MMA) on a Pd20 model cluster have been investigated at the density functional level of theory. There are several possible mechanisms for the reaction of MAL, some of them are the attack routes of the methoxyl, while the others are the hydrogen addition or elimination routes of unsaturated groups in MAL. On the basis of calculated thermodynamic data of the entirely catalytic cycle, the direct hydrogen elimination of MAL then reacting with methoxyl would be the most important pathway, which is responsible for the direct formation of MMA as the principal product. Detailed reaction coordinate calculations were also used to isolate the transition states for elementary reactions in the formation processes of unsaturated alcohol and saturated aldehyde as final products. The stepwise formation of unsaturated alcohol by H addition, and that of saturated aldehyde through the CC double bond addition by methoxyl and H are also competitive."
