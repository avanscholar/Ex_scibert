0,Introduction,"Today, population growth and technology upgrades and consequently industrial development have led to the increment in the use of fossil fuels, such as diesel, gasoline, and petroleum [1]. These because of their great productivity are using for various industries around the world such as transportation and agriculture, as well as electricity production. Nevertheless, these fuels are known as a factor in climate change. In addition, environmental concerns about fossil fuels are growing as a social issue and the reserves of them are declining in the world [2]. Thus, the replacement of clean and sustainable energy sources with petroleum-based conventional fuels is an important subject [3,4]. As one of the most expected liquid renewable fuels in transportation, biodiesel has been broadly studied in the last decades owing to it produces less pollutants and greenhouse gases than fuels derived from petroleum and easier to store [5]. Biodiesel is usually obtained from animal or vegetable fats/oils and waste-oriented oils through transesterification process with ethanol/methanol in the presence of an alkali/acid catalyst [6]. Free fatty acid (FFA) and moisture content are two important parameters in choosing the type of oil. The main part of the cost of biodiesel production is the cost of raw materials. It should be noted that if edible vegetable oils/fats are considered to be feedstocks of the biodiesel for the transesterification process, Biodiesel production is not economical. Biofuels are made from animal and vegetable oils/fats and their use will increase the demand for these products, which may increase prices and lead to food-fuel competition and also it is causing the food crisis in some countries [7]. On the other hand, the industrial usage of inedible oil is very expensive because of inedible oils contain high amounts of FFA and water. Therefore, to eliminate FFA and water, more pretreatment steps will be required, leading to increased operating costs of biodiesel production [8,9]. Generally, biodiesel production and refining processes consuming the huge value of thermal and electrical energy which makes production of biodiesel more expensive than fuels derived from petroleum. Hence, in order to produce competitive and cost-effective biodiesels, it is essential to improve processes or provide energy from affordable resources. Glycerol is produced as a major by-product in the transesterification process of vegetable oils and animal fats. The glycerol produced is as much as 10% of the biodiesel obtained from the process. With increasing production of commercial biodiesel and, consequently, deflation of glycerol its production is envisaged to increase substantially in the future [10]. Pure glycerol is used in various chemical industries such as cosmetics, polymer, and food [11]. The crude glycerol obtained from the production of biodiesel by transesterification contains many impurities such as soap, salt, methanol, and fatty acids. Thus, the conversion of crude glycerol to pure glycerol is complicated and this requires further separation and purification processes that it results in high cost of production [12]. Crude glycerol is generally used in biodiesel plants to generate thermal and electrical energy by combustion or sell the product without any purification. It is worth mentioning that direct combustion of glycerol has low heating value. In addition, high viscosity of glycerol hampers flow spraying and stability that leads to generates acrolein due to uncontrolled burning. On the other hand, releasing glycerol with other substances into the environment causes serious problems [13,14]. For these reasons, glycerol is still a main impasse in the biodiesel production chain. The development of new and modern processes for the use of crude glycerol is essential to ensure the acceptable global production of biodiesel. To date, many studies have been carried out on the conversion of glycerol into value-added chemicals and fuels such as ethylene glycol [15], dihydroxyacetone [16], propene [17], lactic acid [18], and hydrogen [19]. Among these, hydrogen is an effective clean fuel and has excellent storage capacity. Hence, conversion of glycerol into hydrogen as an alternative and renewable fuel has received much attention. The thermos-chemical processes are the most important methods of glycerol valorization to obtain hydrogen because these methods can provide the highest hydrogen production efficiency compared to other methods. [20]. Autothermal reforming, supercritical water reforming, and steam reforming based on experiments and process simulations are studied more than other thermo-chemical reforming processes for hydrogen production [21]. Gue et al. [22] experimentally gasified Glycerol in supercritical water. The experimental results show that using biodiesel glycerol to produce hydrogen by steam reforming have good prospects. Adhikari et al. [23] carried out a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of steam reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production over the variable ranges. Zhang et al. [24] carried out glycerol steam reforming process over ceria-supported metal catalysts. Patcharavorachot at el. [25] investigated optimization of hydrogen production from glycerol through autothermal reforming processes, steam reforming processes, and chemical looping reforming processes. They found that steam reforming under the best conditions of H2 production has highest hydrogen yield than the other two. According to studies, the steam reforming process of glycerol has been the preferable method in the industry scales because of the highest hydrogen production efficiency. It should be noted that due to the thermo-chemical reactions of glycerol reforming is very endothermic, external heating source is necessary to provide heat for that. In order to economize the biodiesel production, the hydrogen produced can be burnt as fuel to supply the energy needed for the processes, or it can be sold as a product to the market. Recently, the use of hybrid-power generation to convert hydrogen to power has been discussed as an excellent electricity generation approach for the production and distribution market of power [26]. A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that produces electricity and heat directly from clean chemical reactions without combustion. Therefore, this technology has low environmental contamination [27]. Among all kinds of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have many advantages such as high operating temperature, ability to use various fuels, as well as easy integration with other power generators devices [28]. Many researchers have been worked on integrated systems containing SOFCs with their focus on power generation. For example, Oliva et al. [29] presented a new methodology to optimize solid oxide fuel cell systems under different scenarios with glycerol. Patcharavorachot et al. [30] presented an analysis of an integrated system of glycerol supercritical water reforming and pressurized SOFC. Zhang et al. [31] acknowledged a novel approach of the SOFC gas turbine hybrid system with internal reforming. They used the theories of electrochemistry and non-equilibrium thermodynamics to demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid system on pure SOFC. Rossi et al. [32] investigated a simplified framework to create dynamic models of SOFC/Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems. Conversion of waste heat to power in integrated power plant can increase the electrical energy conversion efficiency. In recent years this issue has been investigated by using different links of power cycles [33]. To the best of our knowledge, glycerol reforming coupled with SOFC power generation attached to biodiesel production plants has not been fully explored from the perspective of power generation. This literature suggests and analyzes an integrated process of biodiesel production and power generation. Crude glycerol that is obtained from the transesterification process, is modified through the steam reforming processes. Via reforming the glycerol and using of produced hydrogen in a SOFC, all of the energy demand of the biodiesel production and reforming processes are completely provided. In addition, to make biodiesel production more economical, the extra thermal power generated in the SOFC is used to supply the required thermal duty of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to generate power. The proposed model is simulated and modeled in HYSYS software."
1,Conceptual design,"The transesterification process performs by mixing the reactants including fatty acids, alcohol, and catalyst. A strong alkali or acid can be applied as a catalyst in this process. Glycerol should be disassembled from biodiesel in the production of biodiesel by transesterification process. Both glycerol and biodiesel have to remove alcohol (typically methanol or ethanol) and be recycled by refining processes. In the usual form, biodiesel is mixed with water to eliminate undesirable products, exclusively glycerol, which may still be present in biodiesel. Like a solvent, the water dissolves the glycerol and then it is separated and evaporated out of the biodiesel. For the steam reforming process, two streams of water and glycerol were fed the mixer with the same flow rate, pressure, and temperature. After that, a mixture of water and glycerol enters the reactor. Then, the water turns into steam in the reaction. After the production of hydrogen, the separation unit can be added to obtain pure hydrogen. Acid is also added to the glycerol to produce neutral glycerol. The steam reforming process is extremely endothermic. SOFC has the highest temperature performance among all types of fuel cell. The operating temperature range of this fuel cell is 600–1000 °C. SOFC can use both hydrogen and carbon monoxide as the fuel. It includes a solid oxide electrolyte (Generally made of ceramic) which is placed between two electrodes. At high-performance temperatures in a SOFC, oxygen ions (with negative charge) cross the crystalline network (generally a mixture of Zirconium and calcium oxide). In the cathode, air oxygen molecules combine with two electrons. When a gas fuel containing hydrogen passes through the anode, a negatively charged flow involves oxygen ions go over from the electrolyte to oxidize the fuel. The electrons generated in the anode pass through an external circuit and go to the cathode. With this, the electrical circuit is completed and the electrical energy is produced. SOFCs can have the potential, as a power generator and also because of the high operating temperature, to be used as a heating supply for the process. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the SOFC performance. Its thermal load can also be used in power generation cycles such as the ORC. ORC is a power generation cycle for a thermal power plant with steam power. The basis of the ORC is that first the working fluid is pumped into a boiler. The steam then enters the turbine and is then re-condensed by the condenser heat exchanger [34]. Fig. 2 illustrates the block diagram of the integrated process of biodiesel production and power generation that is developed in this study. As it is seen, crude oil is entered as a feedstock and biodiesel is produced along with calcium sulfate, methanol, oil, and glycerol. For achieving energy self-sufficiency in the biodiesel production process, glycerol is reformed and it is used in a SOFC power plant. Furthermore, because of the high operating temperature of SOFC, the thermal duty is provided for the Rankine power generation cycle."
2,Process description and simulation,The process flow diagram (PFD) of biodiesel production followed by glycerol reforming coupled with a SOFC power plant that integrated with organic Rankine cycle is exhibited in Fig. 3 . In this figure biodiesel production process data is extracted from [9]. The flow specifications of this process are summarized in Table 1 . Specification of operating conditions of the equipment is tabulated in Table 2 .
3,Biodiesel production,"3.1 Biodiesel production In this model, the description of biodiesel production concentrates on the acid-catalyzed process from waste cooking oil (WCO) with using hexane extraction. To avoid the formation of emulsions due to water washing, the use of hexane as a solvent has been suggested as a model for biodiesel production. However, the addition of hexane and methanol/water solvents increased the number of process equipment pieces and sizes of some separation units but researchers showed that the biodiesel plants using hexane and water solvents combined with methanol has yielded the highest annual return on investment [36,37]. One of the disadvantages of using alkali catalysts is soap-formation problems which lead to increase purification processes. Acid catalyst systems are insensitive to the presence of any FFAs in the feedstocks. Despite the high conversion efficiency of feedstocks into biodiesel by using acid catalyst systems, the biodiesel production rate in those systems is lower than alkali catalyst systems. Become visible that use acid catalyst systems can be a good alternative to the alkali catalyst systems. Therefore, this system has attracted a lot of attention in recent years [36]. The system uses an acid catalyst. Unlike the conventional methods that use water for biodiesel purification, in this process hexane is used as a solvent to disassemble the FFAs from other components because washing with water frequently causes the formation of emulsions [37]. The reaction conditions in this process are considered 50:1 for the molar ratio of methanol ( C H 3 O H ) to oil and 1.3:1 for molar ratio of sulfuric acid to oil. Esterification reactor is fed with sulfuric acid and Methanol with mass flow rates of 150 kg/h and 215 kg/h, respectively. Mass fraction of Stream 6 is 0.9254 for methanol and 0.0746 for sulfuric acid. WCO with pressure, mass flow rates and the molar ratios of oil 400 kPa, 1030 kg/h and 1.163 kgmole/h, respectively, enter into the esterification reactor (R-100) by pump p103. The temperature of WCO is adjusted in the heat exchanger (HX1 with heat duty 4398.4 kJ/h) to 60 °C before being fed into the reactor. Owing to the high methanol content in the output stream (stream 8) from the esterification reactor, stream 8 is dispatched to the distillation tower (T-100) after passing the heat exchanger (HX1). The heat duty required for this reboiler is 1483 kw. The stream 16 contains recycled methanol with flow rate 1594 kg/h. This stream before entering the reactor (R-100), is used to regulate the molar ratio of methanol to oil. The reaction mixture (Stream 22 at 1395 kg/h) contains 71 wt% biodiesel, 10 wt% sulfuric acids, 7 wt% glycerol, 7 wt% methanol, and 2 wt% unconverted oil that goes out of distillation tower after passes HX2 with heat duty 5261544 kJ/h. Due to the dissolution of hexane in methanol, the process of purifying biodiesel from impurities does not suffice by use hexane solvent alone. To hamper hexane dissolving in methanol, water must also be mixed with volumetric rate of 1:10. So instead of using an extraction tower, two splitters SP100 and SP101 are used for hexane extraction of biodiesel and water/methanol washing, respectively. The upper layer (stream 28) from SP100 contains large amounts of biodiesel and hexane, and few amounts of methanol, water, sulfuric acid, and glycerol. Remaining glycerol (29%), methanol (27%), sulfuric acid (40%) and water (4%) are in the lower layer (stream 27) that was combined with stream 49 from SP101 flows into the reactor R200 with temperature 36.52 °C and pressure 160 kPa for sulfuric acid removal. For entirely clearing irrelevant compounds such as sulfuric acid, water, and glycerol from the biodiesel and also hexane contents after hexane extraction, a mixture of methanol–water (0.14 m3/h and 80:20 v/v) is used in SP101 at room temperature. There are no glycerol and sulfuric acid in stream 50. Then, it was transferred to biodiesel distillation column T200 to clear the hexane. Also, the heat duty required for the reboiler T-200 is 1306 kW. At this step, the biodiesel is refined up to 98.9%. The hexane is evacuated from the upper part of the distillation tower T200 and recycle back to SP100 (about 98.49 wt%) to reduce the need for the fresh hexane (stream 63). For Acid removal, stream 29 with flow rate 490.46 kg/h enters into reactor R200. There, with adding calcium oxide (CaO) to the mixture, sulfuric acid is completely neutralized and produce CaSO4 and water. After that, the output stream (stream 32 with 560.33 kg/h) from the reactor is entered into the splitters SP102 to separate the CaSO4. Stream 33 that contains 61 wt% methanol, 30.5 wt% glycerol, and 8 wt% water, enters into the glycerol purification tower (T300) with heat duty 267.1 kW for reboiler in order to separate the glycerol. Stream 42 (104.3 kg/h) with temperature 93.17 °C and pressure 50 kPa is steered to glycerol reforming process. The mass percentage characteristics of the compounds use in the processes of the biodiesel production cycle are presented in Table 3 ."
4,Glycerol reforming coupled with SOFC,"3.2 Glycerol reforming coupled with SOFC To reduce the viscosity of the glycerol produced, it is diluted with water. This step facilitates the pumping process. The stream 42 contains a large amount of glycerol that goes into the glycerol reforming process. So, this stream is mixed with water (with 66 kg/h) and enters the heat exchanger (HX8 with heat duty 93.88 kJ/h) at 63.12 °C. The stream temperature rises up to 250 °C. Before feeding the reformer (R700), it is mixed with a stream 70 and its temperature reaches 756.03 °C. This stream (stream 71 with 636.50 kg/h) includes 43 wt% H2O, 32 wt% CO2, 16.33 wt% glycerol, 7 wt% CO, and 1.17 wt% hydrogen. Before explaining the continuation of the process flow diagram (PFD), it is useful to provide information on the reformer reactions. The reactions of hydrogen production through the glycerol steam reforming are as follows: (1) C 3 H 5 O 3 g + 3 H 2 O g ↔ 7 H 2 g + 3 C O 2 g (2) C 3 H 5 O 3 g ↔ 4 H 2 g + 3 C O g (3) CO g + H 2 O g ↔ H 2 g + C O 2 g In the main, the reaction (1) can be represented as overall glycerol steam reforming reaction that it is derived from the contribution of two reactions, glycerol decomposition (Eq. (2)) and water gas shift (Eq. (3)). In addition to the main reactions, many other reactions can be happening in the glycerol steam reforming such as CO and CO2 hydrogenation which causes methane to form. After reformer (R700), syngas produced from the glycerol steam reforming (stream 76) which contains 48.6 wt% CO2, 37.3 wt% H2O, 10.2 wt% CO, 3 wt% hydrogen, and 0.7 wt% methane, with temperature 769.41 °C and flow rate 717.07 kg/h is fed into the SOFC system. The hydrogen flow rate before entering the SOF is 19.43 kg/h. The syngas is used as fuel and is heated at heat exchanger (HX9 with heat duty 47.69 kJ/h) before entering to the anode. At the anode side, oxide ions react with hydrogen and carbon monoxide to produce water and carbon dioxide along with free electrons [38]. (4) H 2 + O 2 - ↔ H 2 O + 2 e - (5) CO + O 2 - ↔ C O 2 + 2 e - Since the steam that feeds the anode consists of H2O, CO, CH4, CO2, and H2, other reactions can be triggered at anode side at the SOFC operation temperature. Such as: (6) C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ 3 H 2 + C O (7) CO + H 2 O ↔ H 2 + C O 2 On the other hand, the fresh air goes to the compressor (C100) with flow rate 862.2 kg/h and room temperature. Then it passes the heat exchangers (HX10 and HX11) and compressor (C101) to get the favorable pressure and temperature. Next, air that is completely compressed is entered to SOFC at the cathode side. The following reduction occurs at the cathode side. (8) 1 2 O 2 + 2 e - ↔ O 2 - The main electrochemical reaction in SOFC makes steam and carbon dioxide, and release electrical and thermal energy. Nevertheless, anode exhaust gases include large amounts of dioxide carbon (stream 77 with flow rate 717.07 kg/h), so it blends with the cathode off-gas (stream 80 with flow rate 781.60 kg/h) and burns in the combustor (R600) to decrease the publish of pollutants into the environment and increase the syngas temperature for more usage such as supply heat duty for heat exchangers. The mass percentage characteristics of the compounds use in the processes of the glycerol reforming coupled with SOFC are given in Table 4 . The specifications of the SOFC used in this process are shown in Table 5 . For electrochemical model of SOFC, the cell voltage in each node is a function of the PEN structure temperature and electric current, computed as [39]: (9) V cell ( i , j ) = V Nernst ( i , j ) - V act ( i , j ) - V conc ( i , j ) - V ohm ( i , j ) where V nernst is Nernst potential, V act is the polarization of the activation, V conc is the polarization of concentration, and V ohm is the polarization of the ohmic potentials. It should be noted that due to polarization, the cell working voltage is lonely not equivalent to the Nernst potential. The Nernst potential introduce the fuel cell potential in terms of the partial pressure and temperature of the products and reactants in each node that is a function of the mole fractions of H2, O2, and H2O and E 0 , as below [39]: (10) V Nernst ( i , j ) = E ° ( I , J ) + R . T PEN ( i , j ) 2 F ln x H 2 ( i , j ) x O 2 ( i , j ) 1 2 x H 2 O ( i , j ) E 0 is the ideal potential of H2 oxidation at the PEN standard pressure and temperature that is calculated by the following formula: (11) E ° = 1.286 - 2.887 × 10 - 4 T PEN ( i ) Also, the total mole fraction of a kind is calculated with a function of the mole fraction of that kind in the two directions. (12) x k = x k - x z 1 + x k + y z 2 here, xk-y and xk-x are the mole fractions of a kind in the y and x directions, respectively. z1 and z2 are the ratios of the mole flow rate of air or fuel in the x and y directions to the total input mole flow rate of air and fuel, respectively. It is noteworthy that z 2 = 1 - z 1 . z 1 = N fuel - x N fuel - x + N fuel - y o r z 1 = N air - x N air - x + N air - y The sum of the activation polarization of the cathode and anode in each node of SOFC is the activation polarization. (14) V act ( i , j ) = V act - a n ( i , j ) + V act - c a t ( i , j ) With the hyperbolic equation of Butler-Volmer [40], the activation polarization of the anode and the cathode are calculated. (15) V act ( i , j ) = R . T PEN ( i , j ) α nf ∫ in h - 1 j 2 j ° ( i , j ) where α is the electron transfer factor (generally equal to 0.5), jo is the exchange current density, and n is the numeral of exchanged electrons in the oxidation reaction of H2. Therefore, jo of the cathode and the anode is calculated as follows: (16) j ° , c a t ( i , j ) = γ cat p O 2 ( i , j ) p 0.25 exp - E act , c a t R T PEN ( i , j ) (17) j ° , a n ( i , j ) = γ an p H 2 ( i , j ) p p H 2 ( i , j ) p . exp - E act , a u R T PEN ( i , j ) Here, γ cat and γ an are pre-exponential factors for the cathode and the anode. Eact,cat and Eact,an are the activation energy quantities of the cathode and the anode, respectively. These quantities are tabulated in Table 6 [41]. As it is seen in the formula above, the exchange current density is a function of the partial pressure of the kinds and the partial pressure of the kinds is calculated by a function of the partial pressure of the kinds in both x and y directions. (18) p k = p k - x z 1 + p k - y z 2 Here, pk-x and pk-y are the partial pressures of the kinds in the x and y directions, respectively. The total jo of the cathode and the anode is a function of their quantities in the x and y directions: (19) j ° , c a t = j ° , c a t - x z 1 + j ° , c a t - y z 2 (20) j ° , a n = j ° , a n - x z 1 + j ° , a n - y z 2 The ohmic polarization describes voltage loss caused by the resistance to ion mobility in the electrolyte, and the resistance to electron movements in the cathode, the anode and the IC structure, which is as follows: (21) V ohm = I R here R is the resistance and denotes the sum of the resistances of the cathode, the anode, the electrolyte, and the IC: (22) R = R an + R cat + R ele + R 1 c In addition, each resistance can be expressed as below: (23) R p = ∑ p ρ p δ p A p here p can represent anode, cathode, electrolyte, and IC, Ap is the cross-sectional area of the regions which current flows through it, and ρ p and δ p are electrical resistivity and the thickness of the parts. As well as, ρ p is a function of the PEN structure temperature, and its quantities are exhibited in Table 7 [42]. Concentration polarization is a resistance due to the concentration gradient between the electrode and bulk surface happens by mass transfer resistances. The concentration polarization is appraised as follows [43]: (24) V couc ( i , j ) = V conc , a u ( i , j ) + V conc , c a t ( i , j ) (25) V conc ( i , j ) = R . T PEN ( i , j ) 2 F ln x H 2 ( i , j ) x H 2 O s ( i , j ) x H 2 s ( i , j ) x H 2 O ( i , j ) + + R . T PEN ( i , j ) 4 F ln x O 2 ( i , j ) x O 2 s ( i , j ) Here, x k s defines the mole fraction of the kinds at the electrode surface which is itself a function of the quantities in x and y directions and can be measured as follows [44]: (26) x H 2 s ( i , j ) = x H 2 ( i , j ) - j R T PEN ( i , j ) σ an 2 F P an D an , e f f (27) x H 2 O s ( i , j ) = x H 2 O ( i , j ) + j R T PEN ( i , j ) σ an 2 F P an D an , e f f (28) x O 2 s ( i , j ) = 1 + x O 2 ( i , j ) - 1 exp j R T PEN ( i , j ) σ cat 4 F P cat D cat , e f f here, D an , e f f and D cat , e f f are the effective diffusion factors of the cathode and anode, and can be computed as below: (29) D an , e f f ( i , j ) = p H 2 O ( i , j ) p D H 2 , e f f ( i , j ) + p H 2 ( i , j ) p D H 2 O , e f f ( i , j ) (30) D cat , e f f ( i , j ) = D O 2 , e f f here, D H 2 , e f f , D H 2 O , e f f and D O 2 , e f f are the total effective diffusion factors of H2, H2O, and O2, respectively. It should be noted that D an,eff is a function of the partial pressures of H2O and H2 that are variable too in x and y directions. So the diffusion factor quantities can be computed in the x and y directions, as follows: (31) D an , e f f - x ( i , j ) = p H 2 O - x ( i , j ) p an D H 2 , e f f ( i , j ) + p H 2 - x ( i , j ) p an D H 2 O , e f f ( i , j ) (32) D an , e f f - y ( i , j ) = p H 2 O - y ( i , j ) p an D H 2 , e f f ( i , j ) + p H 2 - y ( i , j ) p an D H 2 O , e f f ( i , j ) The total quantities are calculated as: (33) D an , e f f ( i , j ) = z 1 D an , e f f - x + z 2 D an , e f f - y ( i , j ) The efficient diffusion factor of a kind in the porous electrodes is a function of the binary diffusion factor and the Knudsen diffusion factor, and can be specified as follows [45]: (34) D H 2 , e f f ( i , j ) = ε τ an 1 D H 2 , H 2 O ( i , j ) + 1 D k , H 2 ( i , j ) - 1 (35) D H 2 O , e f f ( i , j ) = ε τ an 1 D H 2 , H 2 O ( i , j ) + 1 D k , H 2 O ( i , j ) - 1 (36) D O 2 , e f f ( i , j ) = ε τ cat 1 D O 2 , N 2 ( i , j ) + 1 D k , O 2 ( i , j ) - 1 here, τ and ε are respectively the tortuosity and porosity, of the electrodes, quantities for which are demonstrated in Table 8 . Also, D O 2 , N 2 ( i , j ) and D H 2 , H 2 O ( i , j ) are binary diffusion factors of O2-N2, H2-H2O and, respectively, and can be appraised as below: (37) D A , B ( i , j ) = 0.00143 . T PEN ( i , j ) 1.75 p . M AB 1 2 ξ A 1 3 + ξ B 1 3 2 The term ξ k explains the diffusion volume of the kinds. MAB is the average molecular weight of AB which is calculated as follows: (38) M AB = 2 1 M A + 1 M B - 1 The Knudsen diffusion factors of the kinds can be determined as: (39) D K , A ( i , j ) = 48.5 d pore T PEN ( i , j ) M A 1 2 where MA is the molecular weight of the kinds, and dpore is the pore diameter of the electrode. The anode pore diameter is used for H2 and H2O, and the cathode pore diameter for O2 (see quantities in Table 8). The simulation results of the SOFC used in this process are listed in Table 9 ."
5,Organic Rankine cycle (ORC),"3.3 Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) One of the advantages of using ORC is its working fluid (R-113) which, unlike steam, is not corroding and not eroding the pipes and blades of the turbine. On the other hand, the small size plants of the ORC can have a significant efficiency due to its low fuel input rate. The heat from the combustion in combustor (R-600) is transferred by flue gases after passing several heat exchangers to heat transfer fluid (R-113) in Heat Exchanger (HX12) with heat duty 76.86 KJ/h. R-113 in this heat exchanger reaches a temperature of 140.21 °C to 192.5 °C with pressure 2.5 MPa and mass flow rate 2154.97 kg/h. This stream enters the turbine (T100) with pressure difference 1500 kPa and outlet temperature 153.9 °C. This turbine generates 6.02 kW power. After the turbine (T100) part of the high-temperature stream is separated and mixed with the cold stream (stream 107) and pumped back to the turbine (T100) after passing heat exchanger (HX12). The remainder of the high-temperature stream enters into the turbine (T101) with pressure difference 920 kPa and outlet temperature 98.23 °C which generates 10.15 kW electricity. The output of the turbine (T101) cools in the heat exchanger and reaches its temperature to 28 °C. The stream is then sent to the high-temperature stream by the pump (P101). According to the equations in Table 10 for HHV and LHV the efficiency with several definitions in the integrated cycle is calculated. These equations are derived from Ref. [46]."
6,Process simulation,"3.4 Process simulation HYSYS software is used to simulate the proposed process. For the simulation process, we in the software environment first define all of the chemical components of the proposed process that exist in the software library. Then, introduce any chemical compounds of process that are not in the software library by using hypothetical tool. The dominant chemical compounds for the streams containing various chemical compounds are contemplated as their representatives. To foretoken the activity coefficients, the two liquids that make the most contribution to the process is used as thermodynamic activity model. For this process, the high presence of methanol and glycerol in the streams of this process makes them representative. It should be noted that for making this process more realistic, the conversion rate of WCO to biodiesel is simulated based on the experimental data presented by Zhang et al. [36]. The principal assumptions applied for this process simulation can be announced as below: • 1 bar And 25 °C are considered as the dead state. • Pure hydrogen considers as fuel. • This integrated system operates under steady-state conditions. • Kinetic energies and change of the potential are totally neglected. • Heat loss from any subsystem is insignificant. • A constant adiabatic efficiency is considered for pumps (75%), compressors (70%), and Turbine (80%). • The pressure drop in the heat exchangers is ignored."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Model validation,"4.1 Model validation Biodiesel production integrates with hydrogen production for generating electricity through SOFC and ORC power plant is investigated and modeled. The simulated model results for biodiesel production process is compared by the results from Ziyai et al. [9] to verify this model. The comparisons between the simulation results of this model with the mentioned paper model in term the mass fraction of compounds present in the biodiesel processes show well compromise as presented in Table 11. According to the Table 11 the simulation results of biodiesel are in good agreement with the outcomes gets from the reference. Comparison of the model presented of the SOFC with the experimental data of Zhao et al. [47] is studied to verify the accuracy of the SOFC model. Fig. 4 illustrates comparison between the effect current density on cell Voltage of the SOFC proposed model and experimental data at several operating temperatures. The outcomes prove the experimental data and proposed model has good approval. This research completely covers the gap of previous studies. Finally, partial communication is used to validate the integrated process. Subsystem Sections are individually compared with similar processes in the industry or sources where process data is reported and validated."
9,Sensitivity analysis,"4.2 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis indicates the response of the system to the effects of design variables that aim to compare various process parameters. Sensitivity analysis is a way to make process optimization reliable. Fig. 5 displays the polarization curve of the under consideration SOFC. It is quite evident that the polarization curve is a function of the component design of the SOFC and the operating conditions. The operating conditions of the fuel cell to draw the polarization curve are summarized in Table 12 . Fig. 6 illustrates the effect of the operating temperature on SOFC performance. Under these conditions, the operating temperature can significantly affect the power density as a parameter. In the operating temperature range of this process, three different temperatures are investigated. The power density increases with the current density to the maximum value and then decreases. The voltage along with the current density due to the irreversible voltage losses is also reduced. As it is seen from the figure, the maximum power density increases with increasing temperature. Fig. 7 shows the effect of fuel utilization coefficient changes on total output power from SOFC and overall thermal efficiency (LHV base) which both increase with increasing fuel utilization coefficient value. In fuel utilization coefficient 0.9 the values of total output power from SOFC and overall thermal efficiency are 0.8605 and 0.861, respectively. Fig. 8 also shows the effect of fuel utilization coefficient changes on electrical efficiency (LHV base) and cell number. As the fuel utilization coefficient increases, the values of electrical efficiency and cell number also increase. Fig. 9 illustrates the effect of crude oil flow rate on total generated power in SOFC and SOFC cycle efficiency (LHV base) which both decrease with increasing the crude oil flow rate. Fig. 10 also illustrates the effect of crude oil flow rate on input flow to fuel cell and cell number. As seen from the figure, by increasing 90 kg/h in crude oil flow rate, input flow to fuel cell decreases from 104 kg/h to 88 kg/h. Cell number also reduced from 268 to 227. Figs. 11 and 12 show the effect of inlet heat to distillation tower T300 on the various parameters of the integrated structure. Fig. 11 demonstrates the effect of inlet heat to distillation tower T300 on mass fraction of glycerol in stream 42 and mass flow rate of stream 40. With the rise of inlet heat to distillation tower T300, the trend of mass fraction of glycerol in stream 42 and mass flow rate of stream 40 uptrend is up. Fig. 12 also demonstrates the effect of inlet heat to distillation tower T300 on electrical efficiency and total generated power that is seen to increase both of them. By increasing the input heat to the T300 distillation tower, the volumetric flow rate of the glycerol-water mixture is increased. Therefore, the compounds that lead to the production of hydrogen consumed in the fuel cell are increased. Consequently, increasing the amount of hydrogen input to the fuel cell, production power and electrical efficiency are enhanced. Fig. 13 shows the effect of inlet heat to distillation tower T200 on overall thermal efficiency (LHV base) and biodiesel flow rate. At 1318 kW inlet heat to T200, the overall thermal efficiency reaches 84% and the biodiesel flow rate is 1011 kg/h. By increasing the input heat to the T200 distillation tower, ascending steam from the tower with fluid moving down from the top of the tower come in direct contact on distillation tower trays. This contact increases the temperature of the liquid on the tray and eventually causes the liquid temperature to approach the bubble temperature. As the contact between steam and liquid increases, Separation process based on the boiling point of the input compounds into the distillation tower is performed with higher efficiency. Therefore, the flow rate of biodiesel discharged from the top of the distillation tower is increased. On the other hand, the rate of increase in flow rate growth of biodiesel discharged from the top of the distillation tower is more than the rate of increase in inlet heat to the reboiler. Thus, the total thermal efficiency increases according to the equations in Table 11."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, the integrated structure of biodiesel production and power is investigated by the HYSYS software. The utilization of the waste cooking oil is indeed an emerging process for the cost-effective biodiesel production. Biodiesel production from WCO with hexane extraction and following acid catalyst is applied as the biodiesel production approach. Glycerol steam reforming unit is attached to the biodiesel production processes for enhance glycerol and subsequently hydrogen production. Crude oil enters into the process with flow rate 1030 kg/h and biodiesel and glycerol are produced with the flow rate 1007 kg/h and 104.4 kg/h, respectively. To obtain energy self-sufficiency and power generation in developed biodiesel plants, the hydrogen produced by the steam reforming process of glycerol is used in the SOFC plant along with the ORC. The influence of parameters, e.g., operating temperature, fuel utilization coefficient, crude oil flow rate, inlet heat to distillation towers on solid oxide fuel cell performance, overall thermal efficiency, electrical efficiency, total generated power, and input flow to fuel cell was examined. The electrochemical model of the fuel cell was thoroughly investigated. Simulation results of SOFC showed that Current density, the amount of hydrogen produced, fuel utilization, cell voltage, cell number, and total generated power are 0.55 A/(cm2), 6.932 (kg mol/h), 0.7906, 0.85 V, 268, and 249.7 kW, respectively. SOFC cycle efficiency, electrical efficiency, and overall thermal efficiency based on HHV are 23.14%, 25.95%, and 86.66%, respectively. Their value based on LHV are 25.09%, 28.14%, and 85.16%, respectively. Overall, glycerol reforming into hydrogen and then converting the produced hydrogen into electricity by SOFC and ORC power plant can enhance the Efficiency of biodiesel plants. It can be described that glycerol reforming along with SOFC and ORC processes not only can provide the required thermal and electrical energy for the refining processes and biodiesel production but also generate a great deal of extra electrical energy which can be distributed to the power grid. Exergy analysis is recommended to better analyze the performance of the system. To investigate the environmental, economical, and technical aspects of this novel process, the exergoenvironmental and exergoeconomic evaluations are suggested for future researches. Furthermore, determining the origin of entropy generation is useful in each energy system. So, advanced exergy analysis should be implemented. Also, by applying the sensitivity analysis, it was identified, which factors must be optimized. Consequently, employing the optimization is suggested."
