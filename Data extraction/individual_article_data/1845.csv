0,Introduction,"In the process of transitioning towards a sustainable energy system (in German: the Energiewende), the replacement of conventional energy sources with renewable ones, as well as the reduction of CO2 emissions across all sectors, are fundamental objectives. Since renewable energy sources are subject to natural fluctuations and thus may not always match with demand, suitable energy storage technologies must be developed to ensure the security of supply. A promising storage option to harness the energy that cannot be used directly in the system is the production of H2 by means of electrolysis. The secondary energy carrier H2 can then be used in the currently fossil fuel-based transport sector, for instance in fuel cell vehicles. Aside from use in fuel cell cars, an attractive strategy to surmount the challenges arising from the Energiewende is coupling the energy generation, industrial and transportation sectors using Power-to-Fuel (PtF) technologies: the synthesis of transport fuels based on CO2 and H2 produced from renewable electricity by electrolysis [1–8]. In the literature, these fuels are increasingly referred to as electrofuels [9–12] or e-fuels [7,9,13,14]. In a sustainable system, CO2 can for instance be sequestrated from biogas or industrial exhaust gases, e.g. from cement, steel and chemical industry. Also CO2 sequestration from air can be considered. In cement plants for instance, 70% of the emitted CO2 is chemical reaction [15] related. According to Harp et al. [16], for an integrated steelwork, the only economically feasible way to de-carbonize in the short term is to use the CO2 emissions as a feedstock, e.g. for a Power-to-Methanol process. In an integrated steelworks, the use of coke oven gas can also be a source for the required H2 [16]. In Germany, around 19Mt CO2 were emitted by the cement industry in 2016 [15]. This amount of CO2 is more than 8 times higher than the CO2 demand which Power-to-Fuel processes would have been required to cover Germany’s fuel ethanol consumption in 2016 of 1485 million liters [17]. Beside the catalytic conversion based on H2 and CO2, the conversions via biocatalytic systems [18,19], bioelectrocatalytic systems [20] and electro-reduction [21] towards fuels and chemicals are emerging fields. The use of non-food based feedstocks (lignocellulosic, algal biomass and CO2, CO/H2 from industrial flue gases or from waste or biomass gasification) is an emerging field [22]. Potential advantages of biocatalysis and bioelectrocatalysis are moderate temperatures and pressures, toleration regarding trace amounts of contaminants in feed gas, decreased sensitivity to syngas component ratio, higher conversion due to irreversibility of biological reactions and high yield due to high enzymatic specificity [20,23]. Especially bioelectrocatalytic processes show high economic potential [20]. Syngas fermentation is still a relatively immature technology but may play a role in future energy systems [23,24]. Main challenges of biocatalytic processes are the upscale from laboratory-scale, the unclear sustainability and the many examples of slow and resource intensive development [18]. According to Qiao et al. [21], beside low catalyst activity, low product selectivity, insufficient fundamental understanding, and non-optimized electrode/reactor and system design for practical application, insufficient catalyst stability/durability is probably the biggest challenge of electro-reduction processes. The CO2 reduction product strongly depends on the electro catalyst material [25]. Mixtures of low hydrocarbons and oxygenates can be produced with Cu catalyst. Using Cu catalyst, direct electro-reduction of CO2 to ethene seems to be a competent pathway [26]. The principles of sector coupling are described in detail by Robinius et al. [27]. The roles of the transport sector and alternative fuels in the context of the Energiewende for a carbon-neutral economy are also outlined in detail in the literature [4,11,27,28]. Since electrofuels offer a convenient storage option for renewables from all sources and can at the same time be added to the existing infrastructure and used in conventional vehicles, these fuels have great potential to harness renewable energy for the transport sector in the near future. Furthermore, as outlined in the literature, especially for heavy duty vehicles, there is a long-term need for liquid fuels [4]. The main conceivable electrofuels can be subdivided into three groups [4]: 1. Hydrocarbons 2. Alcohols (methanol, ethanol, …) 3. Ethers (DME, OMEn) In their recent review regarding the production costs of electrofuels, Brynolf et al. [9] consider hydrocarbons, methanol and DME. This can be accounted for by the gap in the literature concerning the production of higher alcohols via the PtF concept. However, the suitability of alcohols as fuels is discussed in detail in the literature [29–34]. Apart from methanol, synthesis processes for the selective production of C1–C8 alcohols are biomass or petrochemistry-based. Based on the interest in PtF on the one hand and alcohols as transport fuels on the other, the aims of this contribution are to: • Deliver a comprehensive overview regarding the suitability of methanol and higher alcohols (C1–C8; up to octanol) as transport fuels and corresponding possible synthesis pathways based on H2 and CO2. • Develop synthesis pathways by adapting known and novel processes to the PtF concept. • Estimate the technical maturities of the adapted processes. • Make a first selection regarding the most promising synthesis pathways. • Identify further research gaps for further investigation. It is worthwhile to note, that the discussed synthesis pathways also offer promising syntheses for chemicals. This is especially the case for methanol, since it is the one of the most important industrial bulk chemicals. However, this paper is focusing on fuels since the transport sector offers a big market volume. According to Otto et al. [35], the potential of CO2 consumption for fine chemicals in the EU corresponds to ∼0.029% of EU greenhouse gas emissions. It thus can be concluded, that fine chemicals do not offer an avoidance option for large amounts of CO2 [35]. Bulk chemicals other than urea, which already uses CO2 as a feedstock, have a CO2 avoidance potential of ∼20 million tons CO2, which corresponds to ∼0.43% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions [35]. In contrast to that, the transport sector accounts for ∼23% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions [36]. In order to give a first impression, the production costs are roughly estimated and compared with the current resale price of bioethanol, methanol from natural gas and the refinery wholesale price of fossil gasoline."
1,Methods,"A future fuel produced with PtF technologies will need to fulfill two key criteria: suitability as a fuel with easy integration into the existing fuel systems and an economically-viable synthesis [3,4]. The focus of this contribution is the development of synthesis pathways by adapting known and novel processes to the PtF concept. At the same time, in this step the technological maturities of the pathways are estimated to make a closer selection in favor of the most promising synthesis pathways. In this contribution, the technical maturity of the process steps and synthesis pathways is evaluated via the technology readiness level (TRL) method which ranks the maturity of a technology on a scale from 1 to 9. This method was developed by the United States Department of Defense [37] and adopted by the European Commission in the Horizon2020 program [38]. Since the adaption of the original TRL method to other research fields lacks in clear definition, the European Commission developed a guidance which is consistent among energy related research fields [39]. This guidance does not replace existing definitions, but rather clarifies the definitions to be consistent all energy related research fields. The adapted TRL steps from 1 to 9 referring to the guidance principles for renewable energy technologies of the European Commission [39] are listed in Table 1 Commercial industrial processes are defined as state-of-the-art (SoA) in this work."
2,Suitability of alcohols as transport fuels,"This section provides an overview of investigations regarding the suitability of alcohols as blend partners for conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. Due to their oxygen content, alcohols are in general not suitable for usage as aviation fuels. One reason for this is the lower calorific value compared to hydrocarbons [40]. This would reduce the vehicle’s range and the fleet’s efficiency. According to the standard for synthetic jet turbine fuels, ASTM D7566, oxygen-containing components must be hydro-processed to remove essentially all of the oxygen [41]. Besides the thermal stability, another reason for this is that oxygenated species can impact ground handling equipment by attacking the materials [42]. Their physical properties limit or qualify alcohols as blending admixtures for conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. For European countries, the requirements to be met by automotive diesel and gasoline are described in the standards EN 590 [43] and EN 228 [44], respectively. Leitner et al. [45] state that the impact of each property relates to their various technical and environmental impacts, as well as to the tendencies of the desired values of each property to enable a clean and efficient combustion. The basic physical properties of gasoline [46,47] and diesel [4,47,48] fuels are extensively discussed in the literature. The fundamentals of compression-ignition (CI) and spark-ignition (SI) engines, including their respective combustion processes, are for instance described in detail by Bergthorson and Thomas [49]and Leitner et al. [45]. Alcohols from methanol (C1) through to octanol (C8) are also extensively discussed. The most frequently discussed alcohols are methanol, ethanol and butanol. A detailed discussion about the application of methanol and ethanol as drop-ins or pure fuels can be found in Menrad and König [29]. An overview of methanol as a drop-in or pure fuel is also given by Zhen and Wang [50]. Yusri et al. [30] reviewed engine performance and the exhaust emissions of the alcohols methanol, ethanol, and butanol in CI and SI engines. A systematic review of the use of methanol, ethanol and butanol in SI engines concerning the effects of performance, emissions, combustion characteristics and required car modifications was given recently by Awad et al. [51]. Reviews of the usage of butanol and pentanol are given in Vinod Babu et al. [31], Trindade and Santos [32], as well as Rajesh Kumar and Saravanan [33]. The review by Rajesh Kumar and Saravanan [33] also includes hexanol, octanol, dodecanol (C12) and phytol (C20). Octanol is identified as a promising alternative diesel fuel, for instance by Hoppe et al. [52], Cai et al. [53], Kerschgens et al. [54] and Janssen et al. [55]. Analytical assessments for octanol as SI and CI engine fuels were carried out by Wallner et al. [34] and Rajesh Kumar et al. [56,57], respectively. Rajesh Kumar et al. [56] indicate 1-octanol to be an excellent next generation diesel fuel. For comparison, the physical properties of the primary C1-C8 alcohols can be found in Table A1 in the Appendix A. Additionally, a brief evaluation of the influence of the molecular structure on the physical properties is given in the Appendix A. The differences in the energy content are negligible, while isomers have a higher potential as drop-in for the Otto engine due to their higher octane number and the primary alcohols having a higher potential as drop-in for the diesel engine with their higher cetane number. Referring to their properties, which more closely resemble conventional gasoline, Wallner et al. [34] note higher alcohols to be more interesting than shorter alcohols like ethanol. Amongst others, Trindade and Santos [32] confirm this statement by comparing ethanol with n-butanol and pointing out its advantages and disadvantages. According to many studies [32,33,52,53,57–62], alcohol-blended fuels can improve the combustion process in engines and have the potential to decrease pollutant emissions compared to pure fossil gasoline or diesel. In general, soot emissions are also significantly decreased. NOx, CO, and HC emissions depend on the test engine running conditions, which are indicative of engine optimization potential. One optimization, for instance, could be advanced injection timing [63]. To summarize, the literature reveals that methanol, ethanol, 1-/2-/iso-butanol and 1-octanol have the highest relevance with regard to the use of alcohols as alternative fuels. Methanol, ethanol and butanol are already commonly used as drop-in fuels. Methanol is regulated as a fuel for the USA in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, while ethanol and butanol are regulated and defined by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) [64,65]. In European gasoline, a 3% blend is standard [44]. In Sweden and China, unblended methanol is used in some instances. The RFS prescribes a legally-defined quantity of renewable fuels that must be used annually as a blending partner for conventional fuel in the United States. This was created by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was enhanced by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 [66,67]."
3,Analysis of synthesis pathways and technical maturity,"This section provides an overview of conventional and novel synthesis pathways, which present conceivable pathways for the synthesis of alcohols utilizing the PtF concept. Additionally, the technical maturity is estimated. Based on the technical maturity, as well as a further estimation of the potential, the most promising synthesis pathways are selected. The result of this selection is depicted in Fig. 3."
4,Conceivable reactions and processes,"4.1 Conceivable reactions and processes Conceivable processes for the synthesis of higher alcohols are the modified methanol and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) syntheses, Ziegler alcohol synthesis, aldol (aldehyde + alcohol) condensation and oxo synthesis. Oxo synthesis is also known as hydroformulation and is today’s SoA technology for selective alcohol synthesis. An overview focusing on the catalysts of modified methanol and FT syntheses for alcohol synthesis including conversion and selectivity is given in Surisetty et al. [68]. Modified FT syntheses include, for instance, the Synthol and Synol processes. A short critical review of recent developments regarding alcohol synthesis on cobalt-copper catalysts via the FT reaction is given by Xiang and Kruse [69]. The chain growth reactions of both the modified methanol and Fischer-Tropsch syntheses are dictated by the Schulz-Flory distribution [68,69] or Gaussian distribution [70], depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions. Based on the presence of pilot plants for the synthesis of alcohols with modified methanol and Fischer-Tropsch catalysts [71], the technical maturity of these processes is estimated with a TRL of at least 8. The Ziegler alcohol synthesis, like the Alfol process, is based on oligomerization reactions of ethylene on aluminum catalyst with oxygenation of the resulting alkyl group [72]. The result is a broad range of linear alcohols with a distribution corresponding to a Poisson curve [73]. The product distributions of the modified methanol and FT syntheses, as well as of the Ziegler alcohol processes, lead to insufficient selectivity for a specific alcohol. Since the chain growth reaction is completed when the product stream leaves the reactor, it is not reasonable to recycle the unwanted products after separation. Therefore, the modified Fischer-Tropsch and methanol syntheses are not considered in the following. In contrast, the aldol condensation and oxo synthesis are explained. Fig. 1 shows the aldol condensation via the example of the synthesis of butanol from ethanol. During conventional aldol condensation, an unsaturated Cn+1 aldehyde is formed from two Cn aldehydes with the elimination of water. The Cn aldehydes are formed by the dehydrogenation of Cn alcohols (compare Fig. 1: ethanal). To transform unsaturated Cn+1 aldehydes (see Fig. 1: crotonaldehyde) into Cn+1 alcohols (see Fig. 1: butanol), either a Cannizzaro reaction or hydrogenation with H2 is carried out. In the Cannizzaro reaction, the aldehyde reacts in a strongly basic medium to alcohol and the salt of a carboxylic acid [74], whereas in the hydrogenation only alcohol is produced. The Cannizzaro reaction is used in the Guerbet process [75–77], while hydrogenation is used in the Alfol process [72]. Fig. 1 shows the pathway via hydrogenation with the product n-butanol. The aldol condensation is carried out with two identical alcohol molecules, as mentioned before, or with two alcohol molecules of different chain lengths. In the literature, the availability of data for the condensation of alcohols with different chain lengths is worse, which is caused by low selectivities and yields. An example of the comparatively poor selectivities and yields for alcohols of different chain length is the aldol condensation of propanol from ethanol and methanol, which is described by Ueda et al. [78]. The dehydrogenation of ethanol to ethanal is a SoA process carried out over Cu-catalysts with 90% yield. An alternative is the oxidation of ethanol [79]. Although process like the Veba-Chemie process show yields of 97–99%, the loss H2 due to water formation would significantly decreases the process efficiency in the Power-to-Fuel concept. Oxo synthesis, also known as hydroformylation, is the second way to expand the carbon chain in alcohols [80–82]. It was developed in 1938 by Otto Roelen [83] and is the SoA for the production of alcohols, whereby over 50% of worldwide production is the result of the synthesis of butyraldehyde from propanol [80,83,84]. According to Todic et al. [85], who discuss the development of hydroformylation in 1980–1995, hydroformylation is most often used in industrial processes, such as the UCC or BASF processes. Industrial processes can be subdivided in such, which use rhodium based catalysts and such, which use cobalt based catalysts. A more detailed discussion of the different industrial processes, including process selectivities and catalyst systems is given by Bahrmann et al. [80]. Fig. 2 shows the oxo synthesis of propene to butanol. During hydroformylation, a Cn olefin (Fig. 2: propene) reacts with H2/CO (synthesis gas) and an unsaturated Cn+1 aldehyde (Fig. 2: butanal), which is then converted into a Cn+1 alcohol (Fig. 2: butanol) via hydrogenation. The required olefins are currently obtained exclusively through petrochemical processes [83]."
5,Reverse water-gas shift reaction,"4.2 Reverse water-gas shift reaction In the PtF concept, synthesis pathways start from H2/CO2. However, as stated above and also as the following shows, some processes require a process step wherein the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction appears upstream to convert CO2 and H2 into CO and H2O to provide synthesis gas (H2/CO). Thermodynamically reasonable temperatures are above 900 °C [86,87]. These temperatures are technically realistic [88]. Unde [89] proved a commercial Ni/Al23O16-catalyst to be stable under these conditions. Schmidt et al. [90] estimate a TRL of 6 for the rWGS technology."
6,Methanol synthesis,"4.3 Methanol synthesis The synthesis of methanol is conceivable via two different pathways: synthesis from H2/CO2 [91–95] and synthesis from H2/CO [96–98]. The SoA is the synthesis from H2/CO via the “low-pressure methanol process” [99]. According to Ott et al. [99], the production volume of methanol was 47 Mt in 2011, of which the largest part was synthesized with H2/CO. The estimated TRL of methanol synthesis from H2/CO2 differs in the literature. Referring to Schmidt et al. [90] and Buddenberg et al. [100], the TRL of the methanol synthesis from H2/CO2 is 9 and 8, respectively. Perez-Fortes et al. [101] estimate a TRL of 6–7. The TRL estimation can be justified with the presence of two pilot plants: one operated by the company CRI in Iceland opened in 2012 with 1300 t/yr capacity and expanded in 2014 to 4000 tMeOH/yr, which is today’s worldwide largest plant [102], and the other operated by Mitsui Chemicals Incs. in Osaka since 2008 producing 100 tMeOH/yr [103]. Table 1, Since the existing synthesis process is stable enough for a low-rate production and the company CRI sells the H2/CO2 based methanol to customers, we estimate the TRL at 8, referring to the definitions given by the European Commission (see Table 1). According to the company’s website of CRI [104], commercial scale plants with 50 MtMeOH/yr are actively planned in projects (FreSMe project and MefCO2 project). The projects aim to demonstrate the technology’s readiness for commercialization, which would lead to a TRL of 9. The commercially used catalyst for methanol synthesis based on H2/CO/CO2 is the CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 system [105]. However, these catalysts suffer from low selectivity and insufficient stability when using H2/CO2 [106]. Moreover, the presence of water resulting from the CO2 hydrogenation leads to catalyst deactivation [105]. Rodriguez et al. [107] provide an overview for the CO2 hydrogenation on Cu and Au centers and state that metal-oxide and metal-carbide interfaces are promising to increase the synthesis efficiency. Reviews regarding the experimental or theoretical CO2 conversion and selectivity of various Cu-, Ag-, Au-, Pd- and LaCr0.5Cu0.5O3 and regarding Cu-based, Pd-based and other catalysts including CO2 conversion and selectivity and technological advances are published by Saeidi et al. [108] and Jadhav et al. [105], respectively. Martin et al. [106] unveiled that In2O3 supported ZrO3 could be a promising alternative. We estimate the TRL at 3 since Martin et al. [106] did successful catalyst screening in a micro reactor. Although the TRL is relatively low, Martin et al. [106] state that In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts show a high efficiency, remarkable stability, 100% selectivity and outstanding activity under industrially relevant conditions and thus could pave the way for new technologies for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation."
7,Ethanol synthesis,"4.4 Ethanol synthesis Ethanol is industrially produced via fermentation of sugar (from grain starches, sugar beets or sugar crops) using microorganisms [68,109]. Another bio-based pathway is the fermentation of non-sugar lignocellulose. The development of this process is on the demonstration level and has a TRL of 7 [109]. An overview of production pathways towards ethanol from sugar, lignocellulosic and algal biomass including advances and future direction in syngas fermentation is provided by Devarapalli and Atiyeh [22]. Synthetic ethanol is industrially produced by means of the hydration of ethylene from the petrochemical industry [110,111]. These pathways however do not match with the PtF concept. Direct ethanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation is complex and suffers from a low selectivity and conversion rate [71,112]. A comprehensive review regarding thermodynamics, catalyst and reactor development, as well as the status of the technology underlying various catalytic pathways from H2/CO to ethanol, is given by Subramani and Gangwal [71]. According to their analysis, the commercial success of the direct synthesis from H2/CO is thermodynamically- and kinetically-limited by low yields and selectivity. In 2011, the TRL of the direct synthesis of ethanol from H2/CO was at a maximum of 4, since there were no prototype plants at that time [113], but the reaction has already been successfully carried out in a laboratory setting [114,115]. Other possible synthesis pathways are direct syntheses (Mixed-Alcohol-Synthesis (MAS) or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) from H2/CO [71,110,113–126], or synthesis from DME and H2/CO [118,127–130]. In the latter case, DME and CO are converted to methyl acetate which is then hydrogenated to ethanol and methanol [130]. As stated in Section 4.1, direct syntheses have insufficient selectivity. The intermediate product DME can be synthesized directly by means of a bifunctional catalyst from H2/CO (Synthesis gas-to-DME; STD) [131,132] or H2/CO2 [93,133–141] or indirectly via the intermediate product methanol (Methanol-to-DME; MTD [98,142–148]) [149]. The non-biomass-based SoA processes for DME comprise the indirect synthesis via methanol and direct synthesis via H2/CO, where the indirect route is used more frequently [150]. An example for MTD is the Lurgi MegaDME process using standard γ-Al2O3 with typical per pass methanol conversion of 70–85 % [148]. The synthesis gas (H2/CO) used in conventional plants mostly comes from the petrochemical industry. The TRL of direct synthesis of DME from CO2 and H2 is estimated to be 4, since suitable catalysts already exist and tests have been carried out at the laboratory scale [133]. A current challenge is to increase the selectivity and durability of the catalysts [133]. The TRL of the synthesis of ethanol from DME and H2/CO is estimated to be 4, since tests have already been carried out at the laboratory scale [127]. The synthesis gas, which is required for direct and indirect synthesis, can be produced via the reverse water-gas shift reaction from CO2 and H2. Since ethanol cannot be synthesized via oxo synthesis from methane and synthesis gas, in 1951 Wender et al. [151] presented a special case of the ethanol synthesis pathway via the homologation of methanol with synthesis gas. Due to the poor data availability and low selectivity for ethanol, this pathway is not considered in the following. However, referring to Subramani and Gangwal [71], this approach might be promising in terms of yield and selectivity."
8,Propanol synthesis,"4.5 Propanol synthesis The SoA process for the industrial production of propanol is the oxo synthesis using H2/CO and petrochemical ethene [152]. As explained in 4.1 before for the oxo synthesis in general, industrially used catalyst for the oxo synthesis of ethane to propanol are mainly rhodium- or cobalt based [152]. A global player in this synthesis is, for instance, OXEA [153]. A novel approach is direct synthesis from ethene, CO2 and H2 [154–156]. Since there are already suitable catalysts and tests have been carried out in the laboratory, the TRL is estimated to be 4. Besides production via oxo synthesis, the hydrogenation of propanal is the most important pathway in the industry [152], whereby the propanal is supplied by the petrochemistry. The hydrogenation of propanal corresponds to the hydrogenation of the aldehyde in the scope of oxo synthesis (see Fig. 2). Both process pathways are SoA. An uninvestigated alternative pathway is the aldol condensation from ethanol and methanol [78,152]. The TRL of this pathway is estimated at 2, since no catalyst has been investigated thus far. The ethene needed for the oxo synthesis can be produced by catalytic dehydration from ethanol [157–161]. This process is particularly relevant for the production of ethylene from bioethanol, for which several plants already exist [161]. According to Mohsenzadah et al. [161], the used catalyst can be subdivided in the four main categories phosphoric acid-, oxide-, molecular sieve- and hereropoly acid catalyst. In their work, Mohsenzadah et al. [161] give a detailed overview of already existing industrial plants and catalyst systems. On the basis of the already existing plants, the TRL of the ethene synthesis from ethanol is estimated at 9. Industrial ethene is produced from naphtha derived from the petrochemical industry [162]."
9,Butanol synthesis,"4.6 Butanol synthesis Until mid-1950, 1-butanol was industrially produced by the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation of acetaldehyde. The crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is subdivided in the aldolization of acetaldehyde to acetaldol over alkaline catalysts, the acidification of acetaldol to crotonaldehyde and the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to Butanol over copper catalysts [163]. According to Eckert et al. [79] the appropriation of acetaldehyde strongly depends on prices and availability of raw materials. At that time, acetaldehyde was mainly produced from acetylene or petrochemically produced ethanol [79]. The crotonaldehyde hydrogenation was replaced in the mid-1950s by the hydroformylation (oxo synthesis) of propene, which was invented through Otto Roelen in 1938 [164] and gained industrial attention in the mid-1950s. Until 1970 the oxo synthesis was done over cobalt-based catalysts at high pressures [80,163]. From mid-1970s to today, the oxo synthesis is done as low-pressure oxo (LPO) process over rhodium catalysts, which was jointly developed by Union Carbide, Davy McKee, and Johnson Matthey [80]. A detailed overview of the industrially used catalysts of the oxo synthesis, including working conditions and process developers, can be found in Tuta and Bozga [165]. Today, the low-pressure oxo process from H2/CO and propene is the SoA process for 1-butanol production [166–170], whereby the propene is supplied by petrochemistry [171] or as a by-product from ethene production [171]. However, this creates a direct correlation of the butanol price with the oil price [159]. Widely uninvestigated alternative propene syntheses are the dehydration of 2propanol [172–174] and 1-propanol [171]. Since no suitable catalysts with sufficient selectivity and yield have been identified thus far, the TRL of the propanol dehydration is estimated to be 2. The products of the oxo synthesis are 1-butanal and iso-butanal, which must subsequently be hydrogenated to butanol (see Fig. 2). Besides the propene hydroformylation (oxo synthesis) and crotonaldehyde hydrogenation (aldol condensation), the Reppe process developed in 1942 has achieved industrial importance for 1-butanol production [163]. In the Reppe process (also called carbonylation) olefins, carbon monoxide and water react under pressure to butanol [175]. However, the process technology is more expensive, and as a result the oxo synthesis with Co catalyst has been more successful [163]. A novel direct synthesis enables both hydroformylation and hydrogenation, in parallel, in one reactor over Shvo catalyst [176]. Catalysts and kinetics have already been researched [176], and so the TRL of this synthesis is estimated to be 4. Caused by improved bioethanol production and the already mentioned strong dependence of the butanol price from the oil price, there is an increased research activity [177–184] in using the aldol condensation to produce butanol from ethanol in one reactor. According to Dowson et al. [178] and Pang et al. [180], the aldol condensation is a perfect possibility to upgrade from biomass produced ethanol to butanol for utilization as drop-in for gasoline. Beside the use as drop-in for gasoline, Iso-butanol can be used to produce renewable jet fuels [185,186]. This is beside Fischer-Tropsch one of the few possibilities to produce jet fuels based on renewable electricity. A current challenge is the achievement of a higher selectivity [178–180]. Since most researchers are working on laboratory scale with micro-reactors [177,179,180], the TRL of the aldol condensation of 1-butanol from ethanol is estimated to be 3–4. Other research activities to produce butanol are the synthesis of iso-butanol directly from synthesis gas, which is limited due to low selectivity [187] and the aldol condensation of ethanol and methanol to iso-butanol, for which suitable catalysts have not been found yet [188]. For that reason, the TRL of the aldol condensation of ethanol and methanol is assumed to be 2. Another possibility, which has to be mentioned at this point, is the production of butanol with the so-called ABE (acetone, butanol, ethanol) fermentation [163]. However, this fermentation cannot be used in the defined methodology of the PtF concept. 2-butanol, favored as a drop-in for gasoline, can be hydrated from butene [83,163]. This petrochemistry-dependent process is SoA [163,189]. Aside from the petrochemistry, butene can be synthesized via the dehydration of 1-Butanol [189–192]. This dehydration is estimated with a TRL of 3–4, since on the one hand catalysts are being researched [191] and on the other, laboratory tests have already been carried out to determine suitable synthesis conditions [190,192]. Referring to the investigation of Geilen et al. [189] regarding the industrial synthesis of butene, the dehydration of butanol has shown no industrial significance up until now."
10,Pentanol synthesis,4.7 Pentanol synthesis Pentanol is produced industrially by oxo synthesis from butene and synthesis gas [193]. An alternative is aldol condensation from ethanol and propanol [194]. The technical maturity of this synthesis pathway is estimated with a TRL of 3 due to a current challenge in the development of suitable catalysts [194].
11,Hexanol synthesis,"4.8 Hexanol synthesis Cyclohexanol can be produced via the intermediate products of cyclohexene or phenol [195], both of which are SoA. Iso-hexanol can be produced via aldol condensation from propanol [196]. Since tests have already been carried out in a laboratory setting [196], the TRL of this process is estimated to be 4. Industrially, 1-hexanol is produced via the Ziegler process from ethene or from coconut or palm oils [73]. A theoretical possibility more selective processwould be the synthesis of 1-hexanol via hydroformylation based on pentene and synthesis gas, whereby the TRL of this synthesis path is conservatively estimated to be 1 due to lack of evidence in the literature."
12,Heptanol synthesis,"4.9 Heptanol synthesis Pure 1-heptanol has very little commercial importance and can be produced by oxo synthesis from petrochemical 1-hexene [73]. In presence of Rh-catalyst, the intermediate heptanal is produced highly selective. The oxo synthesis towards 1-heptanol is a SoA process [153,197]. Greish et al. [197] discovered promising Ni-Cr-Pt-catalysts for selective hydrogenation of heptanal into 1-heptanol."
13,Octanol synthesis,"4.10 Octanol synthesis 1-Octanol does not belong to the industrially-important alcohols and is currently mainly used in the perfume industry [73]. Today, 1-octanol is predominantly produced from petrochemical ethylene via Ziegler alcohol synthesis and petrochemical n-heptene via oxo synthesis [56]. Both processes yield mixtures of alcohols. Examples for industrial 1-octanol produced by means of Ziegler alcohol synthesis are Alfol 8 by Condea and Lorol C 8 by Henkel [73]. As a biomass-based pathway, 1-octanol can be synthesized from biomass-produced furfural [45,198]. In the literature, there is no process for the synthesis of 1-octanol either on a laboratory, prototype or industrial scale to be used in the PtF concept. Iso-octanol (2-ethyl-hexanol) can be synthesized via oxo synthesis [199] or via aldol condensation [167,200–202] from n-butanol. According to Sasol North America Inc. [202], there has been an industrial plant for octanol production via aldol condensation in the USA since 1962 and other plants in Germany (1964), Russia (1981) and China (1998). With regard to the molecular structure of the octanol produced, no statement is made in the reference. However, based on the general data, it is assumed that iso-octanol is produced in these plants. The required butanol for the aldol condensation is produced from ethanol, whereby this process ends at butanal, since it is the required educt for the aldol condensation (see Fig. 1). The hydrogenation of butanal to butanol is therefore omitted in the scope of this process. As is shown in Fig. 1, in the conventional process the aldol condensation and subsequent hydrogenation are carried out stepwise in separate reactors. Industrially used catalysts are e.g. sodium hydroxide for the aldol condensation of n-butanol and Cu- or Ni-catalyst for the hydrogenation to iso-octanol [196]. A novel process investigated by Patankar and Yadav [196] and Liang et al. [203] is the direct synthesis of iso-octanol from n-butanol via aldol condensation. In this synthesis approach, both reactions take place in parallel in one reactor over bi/tri-functional catalysts (e.g. Co/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3, Cu/Al2O3 [203]). Direct synthesis would simplify the process design. The technical maturity of the direct synthesis in one reactor to iso-octanol is evaluated with a TRL of 4, since catalysts have already been successfully tested with conversions of 100% [203] and one pot synthesis on a laboratory scale with selectivities of 90% [196]."
14,Alkenes,"4.11 Alkenes The alkenes needed for the oxo syntheses presented are synthesized by the dehydration of the next lower alcohols (see Fig. 2). Alternative alkene syntheses include the Methanol-to-Olefins process [204], production via the Fischer-Tropsch process [205,206] or the DME-to-Olefins process [207]. In these processes there is always a product distribution and selectivity regarding a particular alkene cannot be guaranteed, so these processes are not considered in the subsequent analysis."
15,Results and discussion,"The assessment of the technical maturity and analysis of possible synthesis pathways in the context of the Power-to-Fuel concept result in the developed pathways shown in Fig. 3. The dotted lines mark the synthesis pathways, which are neglected from further consideration due to inadequate product selectivity or technological maturity. The alcohols pentanol, hexanol and heptanol are also not considered further in the following, since according to Section 3, the alcohols methanol, ethanol, butanol and octanol have the highest fuel drop-in potential and should therefore be further investigated. Additionally, synthesis is barely possible via oxo synthesis with many intermediate products for the excluded fuels. Furthermore, the technological maturity of the hexanol synthesis and heptanol synthesis is very low. Branched and unbranched alcohols are summarized in Fig. 3 with the name of the respective primary alcohol. To provide a complete overview, the technical maturity, process description, educts and references of the developed synthesis pathways towards the intermediate products and alcohols are listed in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively. In a direct comparison, the oxo synthesis generally offers a higher selectivity than the aldol condensation. However, a recent publication showed increased selectivity of the aldol condensation [196], wherein the carbon chain length is doubled in one process step, unlike in the oxo synthesis, in which the carbon chain grows only by one carbon atom per two process steps. Therefore, for the examples described in Figs. 1 and 2, the synthesis of 1-butanol from ethanol via oxo synthesis requires four process steps, while the synthesis via aldol condensation requires only one. It can be concluded that for the oxo synthesis, many more process steps are needed, thus increasing the energy input, for example by separating columns and recycling loops. According to Atsonios et al. [118], the ethanol synthesis via the intermediate DME offers a higher selectivity, is more effective and less cost-intensive compared to the ethanol synthesis from synthesis gas produced using the rWGS reaction. The latter is therefore not considered in the following. Simplifying Fig. 3 with the non-promising pathways results in the synthesis pathways shown in Fig. 4 . Additionally, our estimated technical maturity (TRL, SoA) is also presented. Fig. 5 illustrates the technical maturity of a complete route shown in Fig. 4 limited by the lowest TRL occurring along the route. The presented synthesis pathways to produce higher alcohols based on H2 and CO2 provide a basis for further investigations regarding process evaluation and goal-oriented catalyst research. As highlighted by Saeidi et al. [108], not only the catalyst, but also the reactor configuration has significant influence on the synthesis performance. Thus, innovative reactor designs are also necessary. Compared with Power-to-Fuel synthesis pathways relating to hydrocarbons (Fischer-Tropsch) and ethers (DME, OME3-5), the synthesis pathways of higher alcohols generally show lower degrees of technical maturity. Fischer-Tropsch is already a globally-established technology and can be adapted to the synthesis from H2 and CO2 with the rWGS technology. OME3-5, meanwhile, is industrially-produced in China from coal, with the intermediate product of methanol. A comparative assessment regarding various aspects such as, for example, techno-economic analyses, process efficiencies, further potential and in-vehicle fuel suitability, as well as integration in a holistic assessment of the transport sector, would reveal the potential of a future fuel system."
16,Economical aspects,"With the aim to give a first impression, the production costs depending on the H2 costs [$/kgH2] are roughly estimated and compared with the current resale prices of bioethanol, methanol from natural gas and the refinery wholesale price of fossil gasoline. Since the different substances vary in their lower heating value (see Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix A), the term liter gasoline equivalent (lGE) was used. 1 lGE represents the amount of alternative fuel it takes to equal the energy content of 1 liter gasoline (32.2 MJ/l [217]). To determine the required H2 demand, we used the net reaction equation and assumed a product selectivity of 100%, which means that the only byproduct is water. The availability of data for methanol enables us to make a more detailed cost analysis. A detailed description of the evaluation of production costs of methanol based on H2 and CO2 can be found in the Appendix A. Fig. 6 shows the productions costs [$/lGE] dependent on the raw material costs for H2 [$/kgH2]. In the case of methanol, also CAPEX and other OPEX are considered to deliver a more realistic value. Detz et al. [218] calculated the costs for a Power-to-Fuel pathway towards methanol. In their case, an intermediate H2 cost of 7.1 $/kg leads to methanol production costs of 1.5 $/kg. For comparison, this value was added to the diagram. It can be seen, that the costs for CAPEX and other OPEX have marginal impact on the production costs. The production costs are mainly dominated by the costs for H2. A comprehensive comparison of cost ranges of biofuels is given by Brynolf et al. [9]. In comparison, the production costs of electrofuels are in the upper range, or more expensive than most biofuels. For ethanol, butanol and octanol, the plant investment costs are expected to be notably higher. However, it can be expected that costs for H2 still dominate. Using base cost assumptions from literature, Brynolf et al. [9] calculated electrofuel production costs of 2.17–3.04 $/lGE for 2015 and 1.73–2.23 $/lGE for 2030. According to the calculations of Detz et al. [218], in 2050, beside electricity costs also costs for CO2 become crucial for the electrofuel production, representing 32–48% of the total production costs. Comparing electrofuel price in dependency of the H2 costs with the market prices excluding taxes of gasoline from crude oil [219], methanol from natural gas [220] and bioethanol [221], represented as horizontal lines in Fig. 6, it can be concluded, that electrofuels can become competitive with cheap conventional fuels, if the costs for H2 is around 2 $/kg. The price of iso-butanol produced from corn was assumed to be 1.21 $/lGE [222]. This value can be met with a H2 price around 4 $/kg. Octanol was neglected in the market price comparison since it is a fine chemical nowadays. It is worthwhile to note, that the cost comparison with conventional fuels does not consider the benefits of electrofuels (CO2 reuse, use of surplus electricity, fossil independency, de-fossilization, CO2 mitigation, carbon footprint etc.). The answer regarding the difference between a single process efficiency and impact on the effectivity of a whole energy system requires further investigations, e.g. greenhouse gas analyses, life cycle analyses, energy system analyses. The main objective of Power-to-Fuel technologies is not to be fully competitive on the market, but more to help to effectively counteract climate change. Beside Bio-to-Fuel technologies which might suffer from land usage and food production competition, Power-to-Fuel technologies are the only technologies that can lead to de-fossilization of liquid fueled transport modes."
17,Conclusion,"The syntheses of methanol and higher alcohols via Power-to-Fuel technologies offer an alternative that is petrochemically-independent and does not compete with food production or land use. Alcohols can be used as transport fuel blend partners with the potential to increase engine efficiency and decrease emissions. As is indicated in Section 3, the most preferred alcohols for use as blend partners in transport fuels are methanol, ethanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and 1-octanol. Methanol and ethanol are already used conventionally as fuel blend partners. Within the framework of the Power-to-Fuel (PtF) concept, the syntheses of these alcohols based on H2 and CO2 vary in their preferable pathways and technical maturity. The direct synthesis of methanol from H2 and CO2 has already achieved a high level of technical maturity (TRL 8). The high technical maturity and probably high efficiency of this synthesis allows for a simple adaption to commercial-scale plants. Starting at H2 and CO2, the most promising synthesis pathway towards ethanol is via the intermediates DME and synthesis gas. We estimate a TRL of 4 for this synthesis pathway. Conceivable synthesis pathways for butanol in the context of the PtF concept are via aldol condensation and oxo synthesis. Since the required propane for oxo synthesis is currently a petrochemical product, the aldol condensation has a higher potential with respect to the PtF concept. For both pathways, process engineering analyses can provide conclusions about techno-economic potential. We estimate a TRL of 4 for the aldol condensation of ethanol to 1-butanol. According to the investigations described in Section 4.10 (see Table 2), no suitable synthetic pathway is currently known for the synthesis of 1-octanol. That is why we estimate a TRL of 1 here. The stepwise oxo synthesis is discouraged at this point due to the disproportionate number of necessary process steps. A possible synthesis pathway could be the aldol condensation of 1-butanol. This is the current state of the art (SoA) process for iso-octanol. At this point, targeted catalyst tests can provide information about potentials for the synthesis of 1-octanol by means of aldol condensation. As a first impression, methanol and ethanol based on H2 and CO2 can compete in terms of production cost with cheap conventional fuels when the price for H2 is around 2 $/kgH2. However, the aim of electrofuel production is not to be cost competitive with conventional fuels. Benefits such as CO2 reuse and mitigation, use of surplus electricity, fossil independency, de-fossilization as well as impact on the effectivity of a whole energy system need additionally be considered. To summarize, although alcohol synthesis via aldol condensation was replaced by oxo synthesis in the 1950s, which is the current SoA process, we conclude from our investigations that the aldol condensation pathway is preferable within the PtF concept due to its having fewer necessary process steps. However, catalysts still show insufficient selectivity. There is therefore a need for research, especially in catalyst and reactor development, to increase the selectivity, on the one hand, and process design and techno-economic assessment of the novel synthetic pathways, on the other."
