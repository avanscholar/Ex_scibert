0,Introduction,"In recent decades, the control or reduction of CO2 emission has become more and more impendent due to the notable greenhouse effect caused by the continuous rise of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and the accelerated consumption of carbon-based energy [1]. Strategies for reducing CO2 emissions include the use of non-fossil fuels such as hydrogen, renewable, and nuclear energies, the capture and storage of CO2 emissions, and the utilization of CO2 [2]. In particular, the conversion of CO2 to chemicals and fuels via catalytic hydrogenation, photocatalysis, or electrochemical reduction has attracted much attention for its sustainability and economy in waste reclamation [3–8]. Considering the thermodynamic stability of CO2 and extensive usage of hydrogen in petrochemical industry, catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce chemicals and fuels may be a relatively promising route [9]. These products (such as alcohols [10–18] and hydrocarbons [19–25]) can be used as fuels in internal combustion engines or raw materials in chemical industry. However, most reports on the synthesis of alcohols from CO2 hydrogenation focus on methanol production [9–17]. The synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols) via catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been seldom reported [18, 26–32]. Higher alcohols have been regarded as better and cleaner fuels than methanol, because higher alcohols have high octane numbers and the combustion of these fuels leads to low emissions of NO x , ozone, CO, and volatile aromatic vapors [33]. Moreover, useful chemicals such as ethanol and propanol can be separated with downstream separation units. Kusama et al. [27,28] studied CO2 hydrogenation over Fe-promoted Rh/SiO2 catalysts and obtained an ethanol selectivity of 16.0% at a CO2 conversion of 26.7%. Inui et al. [29] and Guo et al. [30] coupled Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) catalysts with Cu-based reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) catalysts to produce higher alcohols. CO2 hydrogenation could also be carried out at lower temperatures in a mixed solvent over homogeneous catalysts [26,31], Pt/Co3O4 [18], or Mo2C supported metal catalysts [32]. Although the hydrogenation of CO2 to produce C2+ alcohols has been studied to some extent, it is common that the economy of the previous catalytic system is not very satisfactory. Rh-based catalysts suffer from the expensive price of Rh metal, RWGS and FT-type mixed catalysts show high hydrocarbon selectivity, and the homogeneous catalysts used at low temperatures are limited by the difficulties in recovery and separation as well as the consumption of solvents. Therefore, the development of catalysts and technologies for the efficient synthesis of alcohols (especially higher C2+ alcohols) from CO2 hydrogenation is attractive for potential commercial applications. In CO2 hydrogenation for methanol or hydrocarbons synthesis, a highly attractive route of CO2 conversion is described as a two-step direct hydrogenation process consisting of the reduction of CO2 to CO via the RWGS reaction (Eq. (1)) followed by the tandem conversion of the more reactive CO molecules into organic products (Eqs. (2), (3)) [34]. Accordingly, bi-functional catalysts (with both RWGS and CO hydrogenation performance) are proposed, and the catalysts for methanol and hydrocarbon synthesis were designed by this idea in previous research [9]. Reverse water gas shift reaction (1) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O Alcohol formation reaction (2) nCO + 2n H2 → C n H2 n +1OH + (n − 1) H2O Fischer–Tropsch reaction (3) nCO + (2n + 1) H2 → C n H2 n +2 + nH2O Alkali doped Co–MoS2, as a modified F–T catalyst, has attracted much attention for its unique catalytic performance in CO hydrogenation to mixed low-carbon alcohols, especially the C2+ alcohols [35,36,37]. Meanwhile, this kind of catalyst was also reported to be effective in the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction [38,39]. Hence, the bi-functional catalytic property of the alkali doped Co–MoS2 indicates its possibility for C2+ alcohol production in CO2 hydrogenation. However, so far only a short communication reported CO2 hydrogenation for the synthesis of methanol and higher alcohols over an alkali salt doped CoMoS based catalyst [40], and there is virtually no more publication dealing with the catalyst properties, the reaction mechanism, or the optimization of similar catalysts. In the present work, a series of Mo–Co–K sulfide-based catalysts were prepared and their performance in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation was studied systematically. The effects of potassium and cobalt content in catalyst, reaction temperature, pressure, and space velocity were investigated. In addition, in order to improve the distribution of active components [41,42,43] and thus to improve the catalytic properties of the Mo–Co–K sulfide-based catalysts, various additives such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and activated carbon were added in the preparation step. The physicochemical properties of the additive-modified samples were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption, SEM, XPS, CO2-TPD, and H2-TPD techniques to reveal the correlation between the physicochemical properties and the performance of catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Mo–Co–K sulfide catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation. Typically, a solution (0.32 mol/l, 60 ml) of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM, (NH4)2MoS4, synthesized according to the literature [44]) and a solution (0.16 mol/l, 60 ml) of cobalt acetate (prepared by dissolving Co(CH3COO)2•4H2O, AR, in deionized water) were simultaneously dropped to a three-necked flask containing 40 ml deionized water under vigorous stirring. During the whole co-precipitation process, the pH value of the solution phase was carefully controlled at 5.6 with acetic acid (36–38%). The products were aged at room temperature for 2 h and then filtered and washed with deionized water. The filter cakes were dried at 80 °C overnight, mechanically mixed with a calculated amount of potassium carbonate (K2CO3, AR) and grinded. The precursors were then heated in N2 toward 500 °C at a heating-up rate of 5 °C/min, and then heated in N2 at 500 °C for 4 h. The obtained sulfide catalysts are denoted as Mo1Co x K y (x and y are the molar ratios of Co/Mo and K/Mo respectively). Mo–Co–K sulfide-based catalysts containing SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, or activated carbon (AC) were prepared by a similar method as described above except for the existence of the additive powders in the solution phase during the co-precipitation step. The weight ratio of the additive to Mo element is 54/100. The obtained sulfide catalysts are denoted as Mo–Co–K-M (M represents different additives)."
3,Catalytic evaluation,"2.2 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic test was carried out in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor equipped with on-line gas chromatograph (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information). For each experiment, 2 g sample (20–40 mesh particles) was charged into a stainless reactor with quartz lining (inner diameter 8 mm). CO2 hydrogenation was carried out under the reaction conditions of 280–340 °C, 3.0–12.0 MPa, V(H2)/V(CO)/V(N2) = 67.5/22.5/10, and GHSV = 750–6000 ml/(g h). Detailed reaction conditions are specified in figure captions. The reactants and products were analyzed by two tandem gas chromatographs (Agilent-6820). A packed column (TDX-01) was connected to a TCD detector using He as the carrier gas to separate H2, N2, CO, CH4, and CO2. A capillary column (Propake-Q) was connected to an FID using N2 as the carrier gas to separate C1–C4 alcohols and C1–C6 hydrocarbons. CO2 conversion and CO selectivity were determined using an internal standard, and the carbon-based selectivity of the carbon-containing organic products (including alcohols, hydrocarbons, and other oxygenates) was calculated by an internal normalization method. The catalysis data reported in the main text refer to the data collected after 20 h on stream (when a steady state was reached, Fig. S2). The reproducibility of the data is guaranteed, especially when the reaction reaches a steady state (Figs. S3 and S4)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Powder XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 200 mA. The 2θ angles were scanned from 5° to 70° at a rate of 5°/min. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 350 °C with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 instrument. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface areas, and the micropore volumes were calculated by using the t-plot approach. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken with a XL30E electron probe X-ray microanalyzer. The samples were deposited on a sample holder and coated with Au. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Perkin Elmer PHI 5000C system equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. The energy scale was calibrated by setting the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was performed in a quartz U-tube reactor, using a 100 mg powder catalyst. Prior to measurement, the sample was pretreated in a N2 flow (40 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. After the reactor was cooled to 30 °C, a flow of CO2/N2 mixed gas (V(CO2)/V(N2) = 50/50, 40 ml/min) was passed through the sample for 0.5 h to achieve the adsorption equilibrium. After 1 h of He flush (30 ml/min) at 100 °C, the sample was heated (10 °C /min) up to 550 °C under flowing He (30 ml/min). The CO2 content was detected by an Agilent 4890D gas chromatograph with TCD. H2 temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) was performed in a quartz U-tube reactor, using a 100 mg powder catalyst. Prior to measurement, the sample was pretreated in a N2 flow (40 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. After the reactor was cooled to 30 °C, a flow of H2 (99.999%, 40 ml/min) was passed through the sample for 0.5 h to achieve the adsorption equilibrium. After 1 h of Ar flush (30 ml/min) at 40 °C, the sample was heated (10 °C/min) up to 550 °C. The H2 content was detected by an Agilent 4890D gas chromatograph with TCD."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Optimization of Mo1Co x K y catalyst composition,"3.1 Optimization of Mo1Co x K y catalyst composition CO2 hydrogenation over a series of Mo–Co–K sulfide catalysts with the same Co/Mo molar ratio of 1:1 and varying amounts of K was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1 , for the K-free catalyst (K/Mo = 0), the major products are C1–C3 alkanes, together with CO yielded from the RWGS reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O). The addition of K to the alkali-free catalyst leads to slightly higher CO2 conversion and obviously higher selectivity to CO. In addition, methanol and ethanol are produced, with a selectivity of >70% in the total organic components. However, the continued increase of K/Mo molar ratio from 0.3 to 1.2 does not have significant impact on the reaction performance. The effect of Co/Mo molar ratio on the performance of catalysts was also investigated while keeping K/Mo ratio as 0.6. As shown in Fig 2 , the addition of Co to Mo–K sulfide can slightly increase the CO2 conversion (free of CO) and selectivity to total alcohols as well as C2+ alcohol products. The catalyst with a Co/Mo ratio of 1.0 seems to show the best catalytic performance."
7,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.2 Optimization of reaction conditions To evaluate the performance of the catalysts under different working conditions, CO2 hydrogenation was carried out at various temperatures, pressures, and space velocities over the optimized Mo1Co1K0.8 sulfide catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the results of CO2 hydrogenation at various reaction temperatures. When the reaction temperature is raised progressively from 280 to 340 °C, the total CO2 conversion increases from 20.7% to 27.7%. Meanwhile, the selectivity to CO increases monotonously, because RWGS (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O) is an endothermic reaction and its equilibrium constant increases as the reaction temperature increases. Therefore, CO2 conversion free of CO reaches a maximum value of 6.8% at 320 °C. It should be pointed out that different from Fe–Cr type high-temperature shift catalysts or Cu–Zn type low-temperature shift catalysts, Mo–Co type catalysts in WGS/RWGS reaction have relatively wide activity temperature ranges, generally from 150 to 500 °C, which means that their WGS/RWGS activity is not very sensitive to the temperature variation, especially in the temperature range from 280 to 340 °C [38], consistent with the relatively minor increase of CO2 conversion in our experiment. Fig 3(b) provides more details of the product distribution. In the total organic products, the selectivity to hydrocarbons increases at higher temperatures because of the enhanced hydrogenation, and the selectivity to alcohols is decreased. The higher selectivity to C2+ alcohols at higher reaction temperatures suggests that higher reaction temperature is more favorable for carbon chain growth. In order to obtain high yield of C2+ alcohols and low consumption of feed gas, we took 320 °C as the optimal operating temperature. The reaction pressure is another parameter that could affect the synthesis of higher alcohols. As shown in Fig. 4 , with increasing reaction pressure, CO2 conversion (both total and free of CO) and selectivities to C2+ alcohols and C1–C3 alkanes increase, while the selectivities to methanol and total alcohols decrease. Meanwhile, the selectivity to CO decreases obviously. These observations may be explained by a tandem reaction [34], in which the first reaction is the RWGS step for converting CO2 to CO by consuming H2, and the consecutive reaction is CO hydrogenation to produce alcohols and hydrocarbons. RWGS reaction is isovolumetric and the consecutive CO hydrogenation to alcohols and hydrocarbons (especially C2+ alcohols and hydrocarbons) is volume decreased. Therefore, from a thermodynamics perspective, a high pressure is beneficial for CO hydrogenation and in turn would accelerate the first step RWGS reaction, which results in the increase of CO2 conversion (both total and free of CO), the decrease of CO selectivity, and more production of C2+ alcohols. When the reaction is carried out at 12.0 MPa, CO2 total conversion and CO2 conversion free of CO reach 28.8% and 12.6% respectively, with corresponding selectivity to alcohols of 81.8% and C2+ alcohols of 10.9%. However, too high a reaction pressure has a much higher requirement for the material of the facility and also poses a safety problem. Therefore, the evaluations of the catalysts were mostly performed under the medium reaction pressure of 5.0 MPa in this work. The effect of space velocity on the catalytic performance was also investigated (Fig. 5 ). When the space velocity is increased from 750 to 6000 ml/(g h), the total conversion of CO2 does not vary obviously (around 25.0%–26.1%), while the selectivity to CO increases from 71.9% to 78.0%, which means that relatively less CO2 is converted to hydrocarbons or alcohols. Meanwhile, in total organic products the selectivity to hydrocarbons decreases, the selectivity to total alcohols increases, and the selectivity to C2+ alcohols decreases. It is usually suggested that WGS/RWGS reaction consists of a series of quick elementary reactions, and can reach thermodynamic equilibrium state relatively easily [38]. However, the consecutive step of CO hydrogenation is a kinetics-controlled reaction. Therefore, for the tandem reaction system, with increasing space velocity, the conversion of CO2 remains constant, while the yield of organic products declines. In addition, high space velocity reduces the retention time of the reactants, thus inhibiting the chain growth of alcohols and decreasing the selectivity to C2+ alcohols."
8,Performance of the additive-promoted Mo–Co–K sulfide catalysts,"3.3 Performance of the additive-promoted Mo–Co–K sulfide catalysts The effect of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, or activated carbon additives on the performance of Mo1Co1K0.6 sulfide catalyst was studied. As shown in Fig. 6 , the CO2 conversions on SiO2-, Al2O3-, or TiO2-containing catalysts are 24.5%, 24.7% and 24.4%, respectively, slightly lower than that achieved on Mo1Co1K0.6 (25.5%). On the other hand, the selectivity to CO for these catalysts are 82.5%, 80.5%, and 79.9% respectively, higher than that for Mo1Co1K0.6 (73.2%), which means that the RWGS reaction is promoted with the addition of SiO2, Al2O3, or TiO2. However, when activated carbon is added to the catalyst, CO2 conversion decreases significantly from 25.5% to 8.5%, and the selectivity to CO decreases from 73.3% to 64.4%. The organic product distribution (Fig. 6(b)) provides more details on the performance of the catalysts. The methanol content in the organic products produced by using Mo1Co1K0.6 as well as SiO2-, Al2O3-, and TiO2-promoted catalysts are 80.9%, 87.4%, 86.8%, and 83.7%, respectively, while the hydrocarbon contents are 13.3%, 8.7%, 9.0%, and 9.9%, respectively. The contents of C2+ alcohols are 5.8%, 3.4%, 4.0%, and 6.3%, respectively. In contrast, the organic product distribution is very special for the catalyst modified by activated carbon. The methanol content is 49.7%, methane content is 29.6%, and the C2+ alcohol is as high as 15.5%."
9,Characterization of the additive-promoted Mo–Co–K sulfide-based catalysts,"3.4 Characterization of the additive-promoted Mo–Co–K sulfide-based catalysts Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of Mo–Co–K-M catalysts. For Mo1Co1K0.6, the XRD pattern indicates a poorly crystalline hexagonal MoS2 phase with broad peaks at 2θ= 14.4, 33.3, 39.7, and 58.7° (○). The Peaks at 2θ = 30.7, 35.4, 46.9, and 54.4° (◇) are assigned to the Co–Mo–S phase, the peaks at 2θ = 26.0, 37.0, and 53.5° (△) are assigned to the MoO2 phase, and the peaks at 2θ = 21.4, 26.1, 29.9, and 30.6° (▽) are assigned to the K–Mo–S phase. The formation of MoS2 and MoO2 can be due to the pyrolysis of co-precipitation precursors in N2. The existence of Co–Mo–S phase shows that there are strong interactions between Mo and Co in Mo1Co1K0.6 [45,46]. The characteristic peaks of Co9S8 phase cannot be observed, suggesting that most of the Co2+ has reacted with ATTM during the co-precipitation step. Even if some of the Co2+ has reacted with free S2− in the solution, it is difficult to detect the Co-S phase by XRD due to its low content. Moreover, the XRD patterns of Mo–Co–K–M catalysts are similar to that of the Mo1Co1K0.6, implying that the addition of these additives does not change the crystalline state of the host catalyst dramatically. The specific surface area (S BET) and pore volume (V p) of Mo–Co–K–M catalysts are shown in Table 1 . S BET and V p both increase with the addition of additives to the host catalyst. This can be ascribed to the abundant pore structure of the additives, compared with poor pore structure of the Mo–Co–K catalyst. Additionally, Mo–Co–K–AC shows the highest S BET and V p value of 76.3 m2/g and 25.8 m3/g respectively, which could be related to the unique structure of AC as well. SEM images of different Mo–Co–K–M catalysts are shown in Fig. 8. All the five catalysts have irregular aggregated morphologies. The particle size and distribution is obviously different from each other. Compared with Mo1Co1K0.6 catalyst, Mo–Co–K–SiO2, Mo–Co–K–Al2O3, and Mo–Co–K–TiO2 have more uniform and relatively smaller particle size and there are no bulk SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 additives observed in the images, meaning that these additives may be covered by the Mo–Co–K agglomerates. However, for Mo–Co–K–AC, aside from the similar particle agglomerates observed (Fig. 8. (e)), there are some blocky-shaped particles with much larger particle size (Fig. 8 (f)). These large particles in the catalyst may be bulk activated carbon particles that are not coated by Mo–Co–K agglomerates. XPS spectra of Mo 3d of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . The binding energies for Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 of Mo1Co1K0.6 are 229.5 and 232.7 eV, respectively. With the addition of SiO2, Al2O3, or TiO2, the binding energies of Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 shift to higher values, while the addition of activated carbon results in the shifting to lower values. Yang et al. [36] pointed out that the doping of Co (as an electron-donating additive) would shift the binding energy of Mo 3d to lower value, and the shift value was positively correlated to the interaction strength between Mo and Co. Therefore, the interaction between Co and Mo is enhanced by the addition of activated carbon, and weakened by SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 in our case. The Mo 3d spectra of Mo1Co1K0.6 and Mo–Co–K–AC were studied by XPS-peak-differentiation-imitating analysis (Fig. 10 ). The distribution of Mo species and surface Co/Mo and K/Mo ratios are listed in Table 2 . The addition of activated carbon results in the increase of Mo4+ species. Low-valence Mon+ (mainly Mo4+) species on the surface of the catalyst are generally considered as the catalytically active sites responsible for the adsorption, activation, hydrogenolysis, or dissociation-hydrogenation of CO to form metallic carbine followed by CO insertion and chain growth [47,48,49]. The higher concentration of Mo4+ species at the surface of Mo–Co–K–AC means the higher ability for the production of C2+ alcohols, as shown in Fig. 6. Additionally, the Co/Mo and K/Mo ratios on the surface of Mo–Co–K–AC are 0.33 and 0.83, respectively, both lower than those on the surface of Mo1Co1K0.6 (0.55 and 1.70, respectively). The enrichment of Mo species on the surface of Mo–Co–K–AC may suggest the existence of more isolated MoS2 phase on the surface. MoS2 is a good sulfur-tolerant methanation catalyst with strong hydrogenation ability [47,50] and weak WGS-RWGS ability [51], which may result in the relatively low conversion of CO2 to CO and high selectivity to hydrocarbons (mainly methane) when using Mo–Co–K–AC as a catalyst. The CO2-TPD profiles of additive-promoted catalysts are shown in Fig. 11 . Mo1Co1K0.6 contains a low-temperature desorption peak ranging from 110 to 280 °C (maximum at 167 °C), which can be ascribed to the desorption of weakly adsorbed CO2 [13]. With the addition of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, or activated carbon, the desorption curve varies. The CO2 desorption profile of Mo–Co–K–AC is similar to that of Mo1Co1K0.6, while Mo–Co–K–SiO2 presents a wider desorption peak (from 110 to 335 °C) with a decreased maximum value. Mo–Co–K–Al2O3 shows a low-temperature desorption peak as Mo–Co–K, but also a high-temperature desorption peak centered at 343 °C. The same is for Mo–Co–K–TiO2 except that its high-temperature desorption peak shifts to 243 °C. The existence of high-temperature desorption peak can be ascribed to the strong basic active sites on the catalyst surface. As to Mo–Co–K–SiO2, although no single high-temperature desorption peak is observed, the desorption at relatively low temperatures occurs in a wide temperature range, which still means strong CO2 adsorption on the surface to some extent. As shown in Fig. 12 , a wide peak can be observed on all H2-TPD curves, which is ascribed to the desorption of weakly adsorbed H-species [49,52], most probably molecularly adsorbed hydrogen on surface active sites. The maximum desorption temperature and relative quantitative data are listed in Table 3 . The H2 desorption temperature shifts to lower values with the addition of SiO2, Al2O3, or TiO2 to Mo–Co–K, indicating weaker interaction between H-species and the catalyst surface. On the other hand, the desorption temperature of AC-promoted catalyst remains almost unchanged. The H2 adsorption capacity decreases for Mo–Co–K–Al2O3 and Mo–Co–K–TiO2, while it increases for Mo–Co–K–SiO2 and Mo–Co–K–AC. In the previous section, we supposed a tandem reaction system with the first step of RWGS and the second step of CO hydrogenation. According to this, the strong adsorption of CO2 molecules on the surface of the catalyst (shown in Fig. 11) is unfavorable for consecutive CO hydrogenation because of the inhibition of CO adsorption by occupying the active sites at high temperature. Moreover, the presence of less adsorbed H2 molecules on the catalyst surface is also negative for H2 dissociation and insertion of H intermediate species to the C-species in the CO hydrogenation reaction. Based on the above analysis, the decreasing of CO2 conversion to organic products is reasonable for Mo–Co–K–SiO2, Mo–Co–K–Al2O3, and Mo–Co–K–TiO2. In addition, because of decreasing H2 dissociation species on the catalyst surface, the formation of hydrocarbons is slightly reduced for these three catalysts."
10,Conclusions,"A series of Mo–Co–K sulfide-based composite were successfully synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method. With optimized K/Mo molar ratio of 0.3–1.2, Co/Mo molar ratio of 1.0 and proper reaction conditions, Mo1Co x K y sulfide catalyst indicates potential ability for C2+ alcohols production from CO2 hydrogenation. Under optimal reaction conditions (320 °C, 12.0 MPa, and 3000 ml/(g h)), the CO2 total conversion and CO2 conversion free of CO reach 28.8% and 12.6%, respectively, and the corresponding selectivities to alcohols and C2+ alcohols (free of CO) are 81.8% and 10.9%, respectively. Activated carbon can serve as a promoter of Mo1Co x K y , compared with SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2. The incorporation of activated carbon enhances the interaction between Mo and Co, increases the Mo4+ content on the surface of the catalyst, and influences the catalyst adsorption capacity and adsorption strength for CO2 and H2, which results in a high free-of-CO selectivity (15.5%) to C2+ alcohols."
