0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), as a carbon–neutral energy carrier, can facilitate decarbonization of certain carbon-emitting activities (IEA, 2019). H2 has an energy yield of 122 kJ/g which is 2.75 folds higher than the hydrocarbon based energy and produces energy by emitting water vapor (Staffell et al., 2019). H2 can be considered clean and sustainable only when produced by carbon–neutral and green routes as the fossil based H2 production is releasing 70 to 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually in Europe alone (EU, 2020a). Currently, the major H2 producing technologies are natural gas reforming or gasification mainly through steam methane reformation (SMR), electrolysis and liquid reforming (EERE, 2020a). SMR contributes to 95% of today’s industrial H2 production by using fossil-based feedstocks (IRENA, 2018; EERE, 2020b). Developing and implementing alternative routes for green/renewable H2 production based on solar thermal processes, or renewable resources derived technologies, or biological processes, and adding carbon capture technologies (CCS) embedding with the existing technologies can aid in achieving sustainability towards the accomplishment of ‘Hydrogen Economy’ that further accounts for climate neutrality (Fig. 1 ). Development of sustainable technologies are essential for producing low carbon embodied green/renewable H2 which can cross the economic and technological hurdles. The sustainability criterion can be met by replacing fossil-based feedstock with renewable resources and by adopting biological processes for its production. Green H2 production is listed among the top 10 emerging technologies of present day (WEF, 2020). Towards developing Green economy, biogenic waste/wastewater/biomass has been found to be a potential feedstock for the biofuels production including biohydrogen (bio-H2). Bio-H2 production by dark fermentation has garnered significant attention in the last two decades by utilizing these renewable feedstock (Sharma and Arya, 2017; Lim, 2019; Venkata Mohan and Pandey, 2019). The feedstock plays a major role wherein, wet biomass is well suited for the fermentation process as well as for decentralized energy production on site for reducing cost and energy expenditures (Reith et al., 2003). The nature and composition of biogenic waste/wastewater used as feedstock and its availability will play a major role in the overall productivity and economics. Though significant research was reported in the past two decades towards understanding, optimization, and scale-up, the dark-fermentation process still faces critical challenges to reach to industrial scale (Sarkar et al., 2020). The foremost challenges are biocatalyst nature and its metabolism, syntrophy and interactions among microbes, nature of the feedstock, feedback inhibition, substrate nature and composition, redox and temperature conditions, reactor configuration, and achieving or crossing the Thauer Limit (4 mol H2/mole glucose) (Chandrasekhar et al., 2015; Kamaraj et al., 2019; Soares et al., 2020; Nemestóthy et al., 2020; Ergal et al., 2020). Towards the scale-up, these challenges need to be addressed thus, are discussed in this communication."
1,Role of biocatalyst in Bio-H2 production,
2,Role of distributed metabolism on dark fermentation,"2.1 Role of distributed metabolism on dark fermentation Distributed metabolism of the individual microbial species or taxa present in the microbiome plays a major role in the production and/or degradation activities (EBRC, 2019). Microbial community dynamics during bio-H2 production are always non-static in contrary to methanogenic systems thus the compositional changes may lead to instability and fluctuated production (Castelló et al., 2020). The molecular characterization is evidencing various communities not restricting to Clostridium sp. The major bio-H2 producers are broadly divided into three groups of spore-forming obligate anaerobes (main producers), non-spore-forming obligate anaerobes (auxiliary functioning), and lastly facultative anaerobes (challenged producers) (Cabrol et al., 2017). Clostridium sp., under the first category, is the most efficient known bio-H2 producer yielding 1.5 to 3 mol H2/mol hexose (Cabrol et al., 2017) but are acid-sensitive (pH < 5.0) (Valentín-Reyes et al., 2018). Clostridium sp.is either exploited as pure biocatalyst or found in abundance in bio-H2 producing reactors (Zhang et al., 2020a; Rosa et al., 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; García-Depraect et al., 2020). Towards the achievement of the Thauer limit and exploiting Clostridium sp. capability, an artificial designed microbial consortium of E. aerogenes and C. acetobutylicum in a ratio of 1: 10,000 yielded 5.6 mol H2/mol glucose (Ergal et al., 2020). Non-spore-forming obligate anaerobes (auxiliary functioning) such as Ethanoligenens harbinense, Acetanaerobacterium elongatum (Clostridiales order), Megasphaera sp. (Firmicutes phylum), Acidaminococcus sp. (Firmicutes phylum), and Prevotella sp. (Bacteroidetes phylum) are grouped under the second category (Cabrol et al., 2017). The main role of Ethanoligenens harbinense is ethanol-type fermentation yielding ethanol, bio-H2, and CO2 and is thus considered to be a key intermediate bacteria in the anaerobic fermenter (Xu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020a,b,c). Megasphaera sp. is majorly associated with lactic acid production and is detected in bio-H2 producing reactors operated with diverse wastewater streams (Buitrón et al., 2019). Acidaminococcus sp. plays a major role in amino acid degradation towards bio-H2 production (Almatouq et al., 2020). Facultative anaerobes (challenged producers) such as Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Shewanella oneidensis and Pseudomonas stutzeri are other microbial dominant communities generally observed in bio-H2 producing reactors that are grouped in category three (Goud et al., 2012; Goud and Venkata Mohan, 2012; Cabrol et al., 2017)."
3,Microbiota in acidogenic reactor: favouring or competitive,"2.2 Microbiota in acidogenic reactor: favouring or competitive The bio-H2 production is not just the function of the main key player but it is resultant of the synergistic role of all probable positive interactions present among the microbes in the distributed metabolism of the mixed culture. The specific roles of these favoring microbial communities are listed as enhancing bio-H2 production, scavenging oxygen from the system (as the strict anaerobes-H2 producer), efficiently degrading organic substrates, help in maintaining pH (buffering the reactors), and cell aggregations for proper biofilm formation (Cabrol et al., 2017). The role of oxygen scavenging is mainly played by facultative anaerobes namely Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp., or Bacillus sp. (Cabrol et al., 2017; Elbeshbishy et al., 2017). Pseudomonas aeruginosa has also been explored towards its deoxygenation ability (Li et al., 2020d). These facultative anaerobes have an additional capability of producing bio-H2 thus, can enhance overall yields. The pH regulation by degrading acids can be achieved by Megasphaera elsdenii (lactic acid consumer when it is in excess quantities), Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans and Syntrophomonas wolfei (propionic acid consumers) (Cabrol et al., 2017). Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is known to symbiotically interact with Clostridial species by lactate cross-feeding for butyrate and bio-H2 production (Sikora et al., 2013). LAB can also facilitate cell aggregation in reactors which reduces/stops biomass washout, increase cell concentration, and withstand toxic environment (Cabrol et al., 2017). 2.2.1 Competitive/negative microbiota Contrary to the positive interactions, the competitive/negatively interacting microbiota can lead to severe consequences in overall bio-H2 production efficiency. The major competitive microbiota are listed as methanogens, homoacetogens, propionic acid producers, and lactic acid bacteria (Venkata Mohan, 2009; Goud and Venkata Mohan, 2012; Cabrol et al., 2017; Castelló et al., 2020). The methanogens can be successfully suppressed or eliminated by various pretreatment strategies but the suppression or elimination of propionic acid or lactic acid-producing bacteria is still a challenge and requires proper optimization. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens (consumes H2 and CO2, towards methane (CH4) production), the major H2 consumers dominates in the untreated inoculum/biocatalyst and thus directly influence the bio-H2 production efficiency (Huang et al., 2015; Si et al., 2015). Hydrogenotrophic archaea also utilize H2 for their cell growth thus, for in-situ and ex-situ biological biogas upgradation H2:CO2 ratio is set to be more than 4:1 (Zhu et al., 2020). To eliminate these H2 consumers pretreatment strategies like heat, acid, freezing, thawing, 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA), combined pretreatments have been extensively employed (Venkata Mohan et al., 2008; Viana et al., 2019). Strategies like gradual decrement of retention time (Ramos et al., 2020), reducing pH (< pH 5) (Huang et al., 2015), implementing negative pressure (40.52 kPa), supplementing air (Sarkar and Venkata Mohan, 2017), and using antibiotics in microbial electrolytic cells (MECs) (Catal et al., 2015) are also found to have positive influence on methanogens suppression. Homoacetogens, the other group of H2 consumers, uptake H2 and CO2 to produce acetate. The presence of homoacetogenic activity can be estimated by the acetate concentration in the system though the simultaneous occurrence of methanogenic activity can mislead this estimation (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2014; Castelló et al., 2020). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity can overlap homoacetogenic activity, however, in the absence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, homoacetogens play the main role in H2 consumption in the reactor system (Shi et al., 2015; Castelló et al., 2020). LAB is reported to suppress bio-H2 production by competing for substrate, producing lactic acid and ethanol (carrying out lactic acid/ ethanol fermentation by replacing bio-H2 production), and/or by excreting bacteriocines (Sikora et al., 2013). Propionic acid production is known to consume H2 during its production thus propionate producers are generally considered as competitors for bio-H2 production (Cabrol et al., 2017; Castelló et al., 2020). Propionic acid accumulation in the mixed fermentation can result through the inhibition of propionic acid oxidation to acetic acid by the obligate action of proton reducing acetogens at higher H2 partial pressure (Dahiya et al., 2020a). Also, higher H2 partial pressure results in higher NADH yield which replaces the butyric acid production pathway with propionic acid production pathway for the maintenance of NADH/NAD+ ratio within the microbial cell with concurrent bio-H2 production (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014; Dahiya et al., 2020a). This shows a relation between the propionic acid and bio-H2 production while some literature report claims no relation among two (Wang et al., 2006). On the contrary, the suppression of bio-H2 production due to higher propionic acid in the system has been reported (Khanal et al., 2004; Ali et al., 2020). Still, the correlation among the propionic acid and H2 partial pressure or its production is unclear thus needs further understanding. 2.2.2 Enrichment of biocatalyst towards bio-H2 production Several pretreatment strategies such as thermal, chemical, thermo-chemical, radiation, etc. were implemented for the selective enrichment of the acidogenic biocatalyst (Venkata Mohan et al, 2008a; Goud and Venkata Mohan, 2012; Sarkar et al., 2013; Goud et al., 2014, 2017; Braz Romão et al., 2018; Yang and Wang, 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Mañunga et al., 2019; Mockaitis et al., 2020). Heat shock pretreatment was reported to enriche Clostridium sp. and shifted the pathway towards acetic-butyric acid with enhanced bio-H2 production over untreated consortia (Goud et al., 2014). Heat and acid pretreatments were reported to have positive impacts towards enriching bio-H2 producing bacteria (Goud and Venkata Mohan, 2012). Five different inoculum pretreatments viz. alkaline, γ-radiation, heat-shock, aeration and acid exhibited varied impact on the overall bio-H2 production. Among all, alkaline pretreatment was observed to be most effective for bio-H2 production using antibiotic fermentation residue as substrate (Yang et al., 2019) while the acid pretreatment resulted in highest bio-H2 yield of 66.4 mL/g dry ryegrass and maximum carbohydrate utilization ratio (Yang and Wang, 2018) depicting feasibility of pretreatment for a specific substrate. Utilizing xylose to higher H2 conversion efficiency and volatile fatty acid (VFAs) production was also achieved with acid pretreatment among the acidic, thermal, acidic-thermal, and thermal-acidic pretreatments (Mockaitis et al., 2020). Comparatively, higher biogas yield was observed for chemical pretreatment than the heat pretreatment from cassava wastewater (Mañunga et al., 2019). The characteristic variation among the raw inoculum is huge thus based on the microbial distribution and substrate characteristic the pretreatment can be designed."
4,Feedback/product inhibition on lowering bio-H2 productivity,"Feedback or product inhibition is a problem dealt with numerous fermentation processes, and bio-H2 is not exclusive where the main inhibitors are H2 and VFAs produced during the acidogenic process. Elevated H2 partial pressure in the system directly reported to influence the metabolic shift and varied production of fermentative metabolites (mainly acetate, butyrate, propionate, and ethanol) by altering the electron flow of biochemical pathways and in turn affecting the conversion efficiencies of the reactions and overall bio-H2 production yield (Laurent et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2017; Sarkar et al., 2017). Elevated H2 partial pressure can be strategically reduced by the headspace gas removal, external inert gas transfer, optimizing reactor configuration for effective liquid-to-gas transfer, and utilizing homoacetogenic activity (Laurent et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2017). Homoacetogenic activity is suppressed in pre-treated biocatalyst but still have the capability to convert bio-H2 to acetate consequentially reducing H2 partial pressure but negatively impacting overall bio-H2 yields. Bio-H2 production is well correlated with the production of VFAs where, 4 mol H2/mol glucose and 2 mol H2/mol glucose is produced from acetic and butyric acid fermentation, respectively. These weak acids are known to coexist in equilibrium with their ionic counterparts. The dissociated acids generate hydrogen ions/protons (H+) leading to acidification of media. Also, the undissociated acids due to their lipophilic nature are known to cross the cell membrane of biocatalyst causing cell medium acidification and finally leading to hindered process performance (Dahiya and Venkata Mohan, 2019). The negative impacts of VFAs can be neutralized by system buffering which facilitates the balancing of H+ and hydroxide ions (OH−) concentration and maintaining the system redox conditions (Dahiya and Venkata Mohan, 2019) or by feed replacement strategy (Srikanth and Venkata Mohan, 2014). The positive role of buffers mainly sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and acetate buffer on bio-H2 production have been reported (Xu et al., 2016; Dahiya and Venkata Mohan, 2019; Rambabu et al., 2020). Improved VFAs production with co-generation of bio-H2 was successfully achieved with the sodium carbonate supplementation (Dahiya and Venkata Mohan, 2019) as it is found to support the glycolytic pathway (Rambabu et al., 2020). Metabolically, the acetic and butyric acid impacts can be reduced by NADP regeneration by the function of biocatalyst metabolism (Castelló et al., 2020)."
5,Influence of bioreactor configurations bio-H2 production,"Biosystem configuration plays a critical role in microbial dynamics, mass transfer between solid–liquid–gas, substrate-microbes interaction, substrate retention (Babu et al., 2009; Castelló et al., 2020), maintaining H2 partial pressure, and liquid–gas transfer (Laurent et al., 2012) during the bio-H2 fermentative process. Continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), granular sludge bed reactor (GSBR) [upflow (UASB) and expanded granular sludge bed reactor (ESBR)], fixed bed reactor (FBR), sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and customized designed configuration are widely studied reactor configurations for bio-H2 production (Laurent et al., 2012; Chiranjeevi et al., 2014; Pasupuleti et al., 2014). CSTR holds the advantage of easy design, simple reactor configuration, and operation while the lower biomass retention, prevalence of methanogens, and unstable microbial diversity are the main disadvantages that can be regulated by optimizing retention time and biocatalyst pretreatment (Castelló et al., 2020). UASB is the most widely used bioreactor for bio-H2 production as it holds the major advantage of biomass retention by the formation of self-aggregated granules though the formation of these granules are highly dependent on the presence of exopolysaccharide (EPS) forming microbes (Mainardis et al., 2020). Like UASB, FBR holds the advantage of biomass retention but has limitations pertaining to liquid–gas mass transfer and excessive microbial growth (Castelló et al., 2020). SBR process is based on defined phases: fill, react, settle, draw and idle, and thus have advantages of diverse control strategies, decoupling solid retention time (SRT) and HRT, wide instrumentation applicability, flexible operation, and lower cost due to single reactor operation in bio-H2 production (Santiago et al., 2020)."
6,Immobilization of biocatalyst for improved bio-H2 production,"4.1 Immobilization of biocatalyst for improved bio-H2 production Continuous bio-H2 production fails due to lower retention times and the problem of cell wash-out which can be resolved by various immobilization strategies (Han et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015; Gomes et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016). The cell immobilization technology was developed with an aim to address the disadvantages linked with suspended culture, granules formation for cell retention, improving bio-H2 production rates and yields, stabilizing continuous production during long-term operations and developing resistance to the metabolic stress (such as temperature, pH, and organic loading rates (OLR)) (Kumar et al., 2016). Immobilization to generate bio-H2 via dark fermentation can be employed in four ways (a) Adsorption-based immobilizations which provides better mass transfer, biomass retention, substrate utilization, and higher bio-H2 production through cell charge of the microorganism, ionic nature of the support matrix, electrostatic forces such as ionic force, vander waals forces, hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Biofilm (fixed film made up of bacterial colonies on a stable matrix) growth reactor configurations work on this principle and always have advantages over suspended growth reactor configurations yielding higher bio-H2 and VFAs (Chiranjeevi et al., 2014). (b) Encapsulation-based immobilization that prevents cell discharge into the medium and helps in better downstream processing of the medium for example anaerobic bacteria entrapped in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix shower higher bio-H2 yield compared to non-encapsulated process using an inhibitory fruit-flavored medium in the presence of hexanol, octanol, and myrcene (compounds present in fruits) (Akinbomi et al., 2015). (c) Polymer-based immobilization comes in the category of entrapment methods where the stability of the cells is improved by incorporating into the polymer matrix. Polymers are considered to be very stable due to their density, mechanical stability, and non-biodegradability (Singh et al., 2013). (d) Nano-based immobilization uses nano-sized biocatalysts which triggers the active sites of microbial enzymes which in return increase the bio-H2 production (Shuttleworth et al., 2014; Seelert et al., 2015). Nanomaterials have an advantage of longevity/reusability and cost-effective recovery thus silver, gold, palladium, iron, nickel, copper, etc. based on properties such as high electro-conductivity, larger surface area, and high surface to volume ratio have been studied (Pugazhendhi et al., 2019). Nanomaterials act as oxygen scavengers and reduce the oxido-reduction potential in fermentative processes (Pugazhendhi et al., 2019). Additionally, nanoparticles such as iron and nickel act as a cofactor on the active site of enzymes (hydrogenase and nitrogenase) thus significantly improving bio-H2 yield (Shanmugam et al., 2020). However, the major disadvantages are the preparation cost and reusing of nanomaterials at each step of the process. Though this issue can be overcome by the green synthesis of nanoparticles, still it has its own limitations (Srivastava et al., 2020). The factors affecting immobilization are reported to be matrix used for cell immobilization, carbon substrate used for fermentation, reactor configuration, and the operational parameters (Kosseva, 2011) which needs further attention."
7,Genetic engineering of acidogenic biocatalyst,"Genetic engineering has the potential to activate or over-express the gene of interest in achieving higher product yields. Bio-H2 production mainly occurs via (a) formate production, (b) Fd-dependent Hyd or pyruvate:Fd oxidoreductase (PFOR), and (c) NADH pathway (Mohanraj et al., 2019). Formate metabolic reaction mainly occurs in facultative bacteria where pyruvate generated by Embden Meyerhof Parnas (EMP) pathway is split into acetyl-CoA and formate by pyruvate:formate lyase (PFL) enzyme and formate hydrogen lyase enzyme (FHL) breaks down formate into molecular H2 and CO2 (Majidian et al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2019). In anaerobic Clostridium sp. a different metabolic reaction of PFOR is found where pyruvate is oxidized into acetyl-CoA which requires reduction of Fd by the action of PFOR. Further, Fd is oxidized and molecular H2 is produced by Hyd enzyme. Another reaction which takes place in many Clostridium sp. and other thermophilic bacteria is regulated by Hyd and NADH:Fd oxidoreductase. Fd is reduced by the action of NADH:Fd oxidoreductase, that is produced during carbon metabolism. Hyd transfers terminal electrons from reduced Fd to protons for generating H2 (Oh et al., 2011). Additionally, bacterial strains that have only PFL metabolism cannot produce H2 via NADH pathway hence, produce less bio-H2 (2 mol H2/mol of glucose) (Mohanraj et al., 2019). Theoretically, in photofermentation one molecule of glucose can produce up to 12 molecules of H2, though this never happens in vivo. Glucose catabolism via glycolysis restricts the pathway to yield below 4 mol H2 per mol glucose (Thauer limit). However, an alternate route that is directed to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) can yield 3-fold more NAD(P)H than glycolysis. Theoretically, 8 mol of H2 per mol glucose will be produced when the PPP is involved and 4 mol when glycolysis is involved (Kumaraswamy et al., 2019). The majority of the genetic engineering studies to increase bio-H2 production have been done in Enterobacter sp., Clostridium sp., and E. coli. Bio-H2 yield enhanced from 1.4 to 2.4 mol H2/mol glucose when Fe-hydrogenase (HydA) was overexpressed in Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 (Majidian et al., 2018). Among the genes fhlA, fdhF, and hycA (FHL pathway genes), nuoB and ldhA (NADH pathway genes), fdh1, hybO, ppk and narP (genes directly or indirectly related to FHL and NADH pathways), removal of nuoB or hybO genes reported to yield higher bio-H2 whereas FHL route found to be more convenient than the NADH route (Liu et al., 2006). Overexpression of Fe-hydrogenase (HydA), inactivation of ack gene which encodes acetate kinase is reported to enhance bio-H2 yield in Clostridium strains (Liu et al., 2006; Majidian et al., 2018). Towards achieving Thauer limit, the inactivation of ldh gene in Thermotoga maritime cell lines lead to lower maltose uptake and exhibited increased H2 resistance and production on a per-cell basis exceeding the physiologic/Thauer limit thermodynamically. Here, the wild-type T. maritima preferably produced biomass rather than bio-H2, however, genetically altered strains delayed the uptake of maltose allowing the organism to regenerate additional metabolic intermediates in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) yielding higher bio-H2 and making overall pathways thermodynamically feasible (Singh et al., 2018). Though, genetically modified strains have the potential to produce higher bio-H2 at lab-scale still more research towards economically feasible scale-up and delivering full-scale bio-H2 production with the optimized conditions needs to be investigated apart from regulatory approvals."
8,Process integration to enhance resource recovery,
9,Integrating dark and photo fermentation,"6.1 Integrating dark and photo fermentation The dark fermentation process with the optimized conditions hardly reaches to Thuaer limit (4 mol H2/mole glucose) (Łukajtis et al., 2018). Alternatively, photo-fermentation has ability to yield 12 mol H2/mol of hexose though it is also not achieved yet (Chandra and Venkata Mohan, 2014; Kumaraswamy et al., 2019; Reith et al., 2003). Combining these two fermentative processes have the potential to increase overall bio-H2 production yields (Chandra et al., 2015a) (Fig. 2 ). The integration of dark and photo-fermentation can be operated in single or two stages where later has advantage over the prior due to the setbacks like substrate inhibition, limited access to light, and pH conditions (Reith et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2012; Chandra and Venkata Mohan, 2014; Chandra et al., 2015a). Thus, hybrid system of dark and photo fermentation can be employed to overcome fatty acid inhibition. Two-stage bioreactors have gained much attention recently due to effective utilization of the carbonaceous substrates and lesser energy expense for bio-H2 production (Chandra and Venkata Mohan, 2014). Concept of co-culturing has been also established between alga-bacteria for bio-H2 production where photo-production of bio-H2 in these co-cultures was not only linked to the induction of hypoxia, but also to the ability of the bacteria to produce acetic acid from sugars (Chandra and Venkata Mohan, 2014; Fakhimi et al., 2019). The integration not only increase yield of bio-H2 production per mol of substrate, but also address the issue of optimum substrate utlization. Therefore, such hybrid systems can be promising route (Rai and Singh, 2016), however, needs to be explored extesively."
10,Other integration strategies,"6.2 Other integration strategies Bioprocess sustainability comes with the efficient resource recovery and carbon neutrality. In conventional dark fermentative bio-H2 production, the co-generated products and unutilized substrate are not recycled after the initial process which is ultimately expelled from the process loop. Integration of bio-H2 production with another biological process will maximize product synthesis and resource recovery by utilizing residues for further energy conversion and by-product refining. The dark-fermentative/acidogenic outlet contains VFAs that can be utilized by photo-fermentative bioprocess for enhanced bio-H2 production as discussed earlier or can be integrated with other bioprocesses for the electricity generation (Mohanakrishna et al., 2010; Gonzalez del Campo et al., 2012; Chandra et al., 2015b), microalgal cultivation (Venkata Mohan and Devi, 2012; Kong et al., 2020), yeast cultivation (Chatterjee and Venkata Mohan, 2020), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) synthesis/bioplastic production (Amulya et al., 2014; Reddy et al., 2012; Girotto et al., 2017), as a phosphate solubilizing agents for organic farming (Sarkar et al., 2019) or methane/biohythane/H-CNG production (Venkata Mohan et al., 2008a; Sarkar and Venkata Mohan, 2016) ultimately, converting the unutilized carbon into useful carbon and putting it back into the ecological loop. Utilizing the acidogenic effluent for the electricity generation can be achieved by either using microbial fuel cell (MFC) exploiting fermentative bacteria (Mohanakrishna et al., 2010; Gonzalez del Campo et al., 2012) or mixed photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) in a single chambered photo-bioelectrocatalytic system (PBES)/biophotovoltaic system (Chandra et al., 2015b). Microalgal and yeast cultivation provides a possibility of growth of new biocatalyst which themselves can be used for other higher value added products generation (Venkata Mohan and Devi, 2012; Chatterjee and Venkata Mohan, 2020). Based on the species and cultivation conditions, microalgae species can be chosen to produce spectrum of primary products like lipid, protein, carbohydrates or high-value products, such as carotenoids and nutraceuticals (Venkata Mohan et al., 2016). Researchers have utilized acidogenic effluent for lipid production through microalgae cultivation (Pei et al., 2017). Yeast can be chosen for microbial lipid, caratenoids or single cell protein production (Mata-Gómez et al., 2014; Chatterjee and Venkata Mohan, 2020). PHA produced using acidogenic effluent also has potential application in replacing the conventional plastics due to their bioderived origin and similar physiochemical properties (Reddy et al., 2012). The possibility of using the acidogenic effluent as phosphate solubilizing agent can provide a new dimension to organic farming as it can be a cheap and efficient source as biofertilizer and can balance the natural carbon (Sarkar et al., 2019). Bio-H2 production can also be efficiently integrated with anaerobic digestion generating CH4 towards biohythane (H-CNG) production which increases the engine efficiency as well as reduces the emissions (Venkata Mohan et al., 2008b; Sarkar and Venkata Mohan, 2016). Understanding the potential of H-CNG, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India (GOI) has considered H-CNG as a alternate fuel recently and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has also developed specifications (IS 17314:2019) for H-CNG (The Hindu, 2020)."
11,Biorefinery approach,"The development of an integrated and sustainable biorefinery model that is capable of utilizing the waste streams for the production of commercially important products is an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative for holistic waste management (Katakojwala and Venkata Mohan, 2020; Sarkar et al., 2020). Establishment of integrated biorefinery can meet current bioeconomy challenges to produce high-value compounds at a time within the same boundary. LCA analysis and techno-economic studies suggest that closed-loop circular model improves sustainability and techno-economic feasibility of any bioprocess. The closed-loop approach facilitates the integration of numerous unit operations for product synthesis to promote reutilization of product components and its value durability (Venkata Mohan et al., 2020a). The VFAs produced from acidogenesis can act as substrates for the production of alcohols, bioplastics, microalgal or microbial lipids, bioelectricity, etc. CO2 can be captured and diverted towards various other important chemicals (Venkata Mohan et al., 2016) as elaborated in earlier section. Unutilized substrate generated during acidogenic fermentation and from various other biological process integrations can be explored as an alternative feedstock for the cultivation of microalgae (mixotrophic/ heterotrophic modes). After extraction of primary products the microalgal biomass can be directly utilized as biofertilizer or biomass that could be hydrolysed into fermentable sugar and can be further utilized for secondary product syntheses like bio-H2, VFAs, bioethanol, higher alcohols and CH4 (Venkata Mohan et al., 2020b) in closed loop approach (Fig. 3 ). Yeast biomass obtained after extracting primary products can also be used as nitrogen source (Hakobyan et al., 2012). Closed-loop biorefinery improves applicability, economic feasibility, ensures material safety and environmental sustainability for establishing an ecofriendly and sustainable platform for bio-fuels and commodity chemical production."
12,Delivering renewable biohydrogen – commercialization and widespread adoption,"Bio-H2 though considered as an alternative energy carrier, its commercialization is a way more forward endeavor (da Silva Veras et al., 2017). H2 fuel has the potential to be used in situ but not as a long distance commodity. H2 as a fuel is mainly used in fuel cells for energy production. H2 in fuel cells can be a best source of fuel since they have high thermal efficiency (Wang et al., 2018). However, the biggest barrier for commercialization of H2 fuel is high cost (of production) and other various technical issues such as reliability and durability. In order to attain a sufficient capital return, with positive response from the End User, rigorous optimization from prototype phase to product deployment is required. Renewable H2 has been considered as the most sustainable H2 and among which the biomass/waste-derived H2 is equally important. The most critical aspect of this form of bio-H2 is the non-linear productivity from small to large scale production. Using biogenic waste/biomass as feedstocks for bio-H2 can reduce the load on fossil feedstock but brings various challenges. The major challenge is of heterogeneity in its composition and also its availability. Though the biogenic waste is abundant, but its collection, segregation, pretreatment at large scale, transportation and storage are still the major challenges (Dahiya et al., 2020b). These challenges can be overcome by proper and strict regulations from the Government for segregating waste at household levels, providing dedicated vehicles and site for the transportation and dumping of these wastes. Agriculture wastes though do not have the problem of segregation but its complex nature requires proper pretreatment strategies for utilizing it as feedstock. The cost of transportation of these feedstock can be reduced by providing bio-H2 production sitenear or in the centralized waste treatment facilities. The production facility itself can generate acidogenic streams with residual COD and VFAs content which can be treated by integrating biorefinery systems (Venkata Mohan et al., 2016; Hemalatha et al., 2019). Also, the dark-fermentative process co-generates CO2 that can be used as feedstock for other bioprocesses if efficiently purified and captured. Production of biomass with smart farming, utilizing and handling waste/wastewater/biomass effectively, capturing carbon efficiently can address these challenges as depicted in Fig. 4 . To utilize bio-H2 as fuel, purification, storage and transportation acts as main hurdle. The processes at present being energy-intensive and cost-ineffective, the purification and storage of bio-H2 remains a challenge (Kazakov et al., 2016; DOE, 2015). These are the major challenges that are required to be addressed for purification and storage of bio-H2 (Kazakov et al., 2016). Also, the separation of bio-H2 from complex biological gas mixtures is a difficult task as CO2, water vapour, hydrogen sulphide, etc. poses greater risk to achieve the required purification efficiency. The foremost challenges for bio-H2 storage in terms of its use as fuel include parameters such as energy efficiency, durability refueling time and cost (Bakonyi et al., 2015). The energy required for the exchange of H2 fuel is a concern for solid-state materials in a reversible manner. The generally used H2 purification methods such as pressure swing adsorption, cryogenic distillation, etc. are not applicable for purification of bio-H2 because of the requirements in feeding gas (near to 75–90%), operating pressures and temperatures. The optimum separation methods must take into consideration the mixture volume and composition, variation in production of gases with respect to time and the product quality (Bakonyi et al., 2015). With regard to refuelling time, it is necessary to develop refueling time systems of less than a few minutes over the H2 lifetime. In addition, the cost of onboard H2 storage being highly expensive, low cost and high volume manufacturing methodologies are needed for better storage (DOE, 2015). Adsorption/absorption and membrane processes are the two main technologies used for the purification and storage of H2, wherein the combination of both using organic polymer membranes for gas separation can provide novel and reliable opportunities (Pientka et al., 2014). However, these processes produce H2 concentrations of up to 75–80% which cannot be used for fuel cells application. Metal hydrides if used for this purpose, need to be surface modified or the impurities have to be removed in the presence of poisonous gases like CO, H2S, etc. (Kazakov et al., 2016). To conclude, a particular standardized operating process and code is required for H2 storage systems. H2 produced either in centralized or decentralized facilities; its transportation to the fueling stations is a challenge. Centralized facilities have lower H2 generation cost and higher transportation while the scenario is opposite for the decentralized facilities (DST, 2020). H2 can be transported in the form of compressed gas, liquefied form or in large molecules in dedicated transportation facilities depending on the geographical location through pipelines, tanks via roads or via shipping (DST, 2020). Bio-H2 production needs a special dedicated infrastructure for its production at centralized or decentralized facilities and similarly for its transportation. There is a need for proper channeling for producing sustainable bio-H2 and regulations for its storage, transportation and commercialization. There is a need for a policy framework that supports adequate research in the thrust areas like large scale production, designs of fuel engines, storage and transportation of fuel over a longer distance. Support and investment from industrial stakeholders for research over these thrust areas makes way for a new dawn of energy revolution. For commercial production and attracting the investors,incentives should be encouraged with a margin of profit. The selection of feedstock like biomass or biogenic waste should be given significant importance with government regulations. All environmental, economic and social aspects should be included with better economic regulations. If the H2 storage and transportation infrastructure will be well established then bio-H2 can be easily blended or infused with the conventionally produced H2."
13,Economics of Bio-renewable H2,"In an estimate, by 2050 24% global energy demand can be met by clean H2 with annual sales within the range of €630 billion (EU, 2020a). To achieve this demand requirement and fixing the cost of bio-H2 as fuel includes the availability of raw materials, processes optimization and transportation. With storage and transportation still a major problem to be solved, the production is always a major cost barrier. The production of algal bio-H2 alone costs about 5 million USD for one lakh square meter(Amos, 2004). This cost includes bio-H2 storage, algal culturing and engineering costs. The cost of photobiological and fermentative bio-H2 was estimated to be 0.0106 US $ GJ−1 and also, cost per kilogram of H2 from direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photofermentation and dark fermentation were estimated to be $1342.27, $1.96, $3.70 and $18.70, respectively (Sharma and Kaushik, 2017). Further, it was estimated that the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of bio-H2 will reach the competitive cost of around USD 2 to 3 per kg within the time period of 2008 (lab-scale) to 2042 (commercialization scale) with that of conventional fossil fuel and E85 (Lee, 2016a). According to another report, biomass-based microbial produced H2 cost wasestimated as INR 813/Kgas compared to SMR which produced H2 at INR 150/kg (DST, 2020). European Union has reported H2 cost of around €1.5 /kg for fossil-based H2, €2/kg for fossil-based H2 with carbon capture and €2.5–5.5/kg for renewable H2 in its territory (EU, 2020a). The feedstock cost is also critical as it impacts the overall product cost similar to the operating and maintenance costs (O&M), thus utilizing waste can be a potential option (Lee, 2016b). US Department of Energy (DOE) is targeting towards < $2 per kg for H2 production and $8/kWh for its storage systems with an ultimate cost of an <$4/kg for delivered and dispensed H2 (DOE, 2018). DOE has prepared a strategy to implement near-term, mid-term and long-term technologies where the near-term technologies includes present H2 generation while mid-term technologies includes renewable resources based energy andlong-term technologies include the pathways with near-net zero carbon emissions (EERE, 2020b) (Fig. 5 )."
14,Sustainability analysis of bio-H2 production,"Sustainability is key towards the development of Hydrogen economy where renewable H2 will play a critical role due to its energy and environmental perspectives (Rathore et al., 2018; Sarkar et al., 2020). Biobased products are generally considered as sustainable but technically not always found so. Thus, it always becomes important to access any bioproduct’s sustainability before launching into the main market. Life cycle assessment (LCA) will be a critical tool in performing sustainability analysis by assessing the associated environmental impacts during their life cycle (Dahiya et al., 2020b). LCA has been performed from bio-H2 at lab scale to pilot scale based on either different feedstocks or production processes (Reaño, 2020; Wulf and Kaltschmitt, 2013; Valente et al., 2017). Different approaches like gate-to-gate (Reaño, 2020), cradle-to-gate, cradle-to-grave, and gate-to-grave are used in H2 producing systems (Valente et al., 2017). These studies revealed that the full-scale renewable H2 production and its utilization in the real field is still under development stage and needs momentum. Marking the importance of substrate in bio-H2 production towards it sustainability, the 1.23 billion tonnes of the agricultural residues can generate 10.56 Mt of bio-H2 equivalent accounting 16% of the world’s total H2 production which could be further increased to 42% if higher agricultural residues are collected. The amount of collectable agricultural residues and bio-H2 from it might increase to 1.74 billion tonnes and 15.15 Mt, respectively by 2030. Additionally, a total of 59.84 (in 2013) and 85.86 (in 2030) Mt of ammonia can be synthesized by biochemically produced bio-H2 and also 35.38 Mt of natural gas could be saved but if steam reforming method is used for H2 production it will lead to a reduction of 75.5 Mt CO2 eq in GHG emissions and $3.02 billion in the related social costs (Alavijeh et al., 2020). Though the bio-H2 production is booming other factors, like utilization of organic residues effectively, process efficiencies, etc. needs to be considered for economic viability and environmental sustainability."
15,Conclusions,"Bio-H2 is still dealing with the challenge of its process optimization and scale-up. Bio-H2 though meets the major criterion of decarbonised economy, yet achieving the Thauer limit and further its commercialization are critical prerequisites compared to fossil-based H2. Feedstock selection and its preparation for utilizing as substrate are found to be an important criterion for sustainable and economically viable bio-H2 production. Integrating and implementing biorefinery circular models, and carbon capture is required for efficient resource recovery. There is a need to understand the process, associated environmental and socio-economic limitations for its translation and development."
