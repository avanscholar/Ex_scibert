0,Introduction,"As the rapidly increasing energy demand and the clearly seen unsustainability of the fossil fuel dominated energy supply system, the development of technologies for producing clean and sustainable energy has received numerous attention in both the research and application fields. As the solar irradiation absorbed by the Earth in one hour is more than the current annual energy consumption of the world [1], the utilization of solar energy by means of photocatalysis for hydrogen production via water splitting is of great significance. Photocatalysis can be described as the acceleration of photoreactions by employing catalysts, in which chemical molecules interact with the electron-hole (e−−h+) pairs that are generated by suitable electromagnetic excitation of the photocatalyst to form new compounds. One of the most significant investigations on heterogeneous photocatalytic processes can be dated back to the 1970s, when semiconductor (TiO2) based electrode shows the promising capability of splitting water under UV irradiation [2]. Since then, researches on heterogeneous photocatalysis have been rapidly expended to fuel generation by means of H2 evolution and CO2 reduction [3,4], water and air purification [5], and value-added organic synthesis [6]. Meanwhile, a variety of photocatalyst materials including metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3) [7–9], sulfides (e.g., CdS, MoS2) [8,10], and nitrides (e.g., Ta3N5, C3N4) [11–13] were developed for the aforementioned applications. A heterogeneous catalytic reaction usually involves three steps: adsorption (physisorption and chemisorption) of reactants, successive surface reactions, and desorption of products [14], which can be divided into two major categories for photocatalysis: the adsorption, dissociation and desorption of molecules, and surface reactions. The first step in the photocatalytic system is the activation of reactant molecules via their chemisorption on the photocatalysts, signifying the formation of strong chemical bonds between photocatalysts and reactant molecules; while the final step is the desorption of products from the photocatalysts, which can also release the fresh active sites one the catalysts. The elementary steps of adsorption and desorption processes have been further investigated to understand the reaction mechanism clearly by using the methods of scanning tunneling microscope (STM), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the step of surface reaction is also very critical in photocatalysis, involving the excitation, separation and capture of photo-excited charge carriers that attract much research effort to improve photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, all these elementary steps must be comprehensively optimized to design photocatalysts with high activity for H2 evolution and water splitting. Despite the significant progresses in this field within the last 40 years, the large-scale applications of photocatalysis have not been appeared yet due to several major challenges. Firstly, for the charge carriers excitation process, the bandgaps for most commonly used photocatalyst materials are not well matched with the solar spectrum, resulting in poor absorption of the major portion of the solar radiation. For example, the most widely investigated TiO2 exhibits a bandgap of 3.2 eV (anatase) that can only absorb UV light (λ < 388 nm) [15], consequently only ˜4–5% of the solar spectrum can be used. Some sulfide compounds show suitable bandgaps for visible light absorption (e.g., CdS), however, their low valence band potentials cannot provide sufficient driving force for oxygen evolution, and their stabilities are not satisfactory for applications. Secondly, in the process of charges separation, the rapid recombination kinetics of the photo-excited e−−h+ pairs results in the very low efficiency in utilizing photon energy for catalytic reactions. Various strategies have been carried out to extend the light absorption range of the photocatalyst and enhance the effective separation of e−−h+ pairs to improve the H2 production efficiency, including engineering the crystallite size, polymorph composition, orientation, heterojunctions, and impurity concentrations [7,15–17]. Thirdly, the sluggish surface reaction kinetics leads to low charges utilization along with the accumulation of photogenerated charges, greatly raising the possibility of the undesired side reactions. Multiple modification methods are employed to accelerate the charges capture, including introducing co-catalyst and exposing more active sites. These progresses can be found in several reviews that summarized the recent development in synthesis, characterization, and modification of photocatalyst materials for improving H2 production efficiency. However, although the photocatalytic performance of the modified materials has been improved to some extent, significant enhancement is still required for industrial scale applications. Obviously, the lack of fundamental understanding on how the electronic properties and geometric structure of the photocatalyst materials affect the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the elementary reaction steps limits the design of high-performance photocatalyst systems. To date, some excellent reviews have been dedicated to the efforts on regulating the electronic structure and charges separation of heterogeneous photocatalysts for the improved hydrogen production and water splitting [18–20]. However, no review summarize the recent progresses from the perspective of elementary reaction steps including the adsorption/desorption of reactant/product molecules as well as the excitation, separation and capture of charges, apparently which are inseparable and interactive in heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions. Therefore, a comprehensive review centering on every elementary reaction step is very necessary for understanding the recent progresses of photocatalysis toward the large-scale applications. In this review, we focus on the recent development in the fundamental understanding of photocatalytic H2 and/or O2 production from the perspective of elementary reaction steps. The optimization of electronic structure and construction of effective Schottky junction/heterojunction with the knowledge of elementary steps will hopefully enhance the utilization of visible light and quantum efficiency. Special attentions are paid to understand the reaction mechanisms of elementary steps, and the effect of various strategies on tuning the electronic properties of the materials by surface science approaches, time resolved spectroscopy, radical chemistry, and density functional theory (DFT). The potentials to design novel photocatalyst materials by using the aforementioned experimental and theoretical approaches are also discussed. Finally, a conclusion of reviewed works is provided along with a brief perspective."
1,Principle of heterogeneous photocatalysis,"The electronic structures of the semiconductor photocatalysts (i.e., CdS, Ta3N5, and TiO2) are characterized by an empty conduction band (CB) and a filled valence band (VB), which enables the excitation of e− to the CB while leaving h+ in the VB under electromagnetic radiation with a photon energy larger than the band-gap (Eg ) of the material (Fig. 1 A and B). Subsequently, the photon generated e−−h+ pairs can either be trapped on the metastable surface states (i.e., Mn-1 and OH•) or interact with electron acceptors (A) and donors (D) that are adsorbed on the semiconductor surface or within the surrounding electrical double layer of the charged particles. Whilst A and D should be H+ and H2O respectively for water splitting, H2 evolution can also be realized in the presence of scavengers (i.e., alcohols, Na2S). In this case the scavengers serve as electron donors. The photocatalytic performance of heterogeneous catalyst is forcefully affected by the elementary steps, i.e. the adsorption and dissociation of reactants and desorption of products (scavengers, H2O, O2, H2), and the surface reactions refereing to the excitation, separation and capture of charge carries. Firstly, the types and forms of adsorption species not only determine the reaction rate in the subsequent photocatalytic reactions, but also affect the reaction direction; while the fast desorption of product can supply more effective active sites for photocatalytic reactions. On one side, the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products are affected by the nanostructure, crystal texture and defect; on the other side, the adsorption and desorption of reactant/product species can also change the electronic structure of photocatalysts and prolong the lifetime of charge carriers. Secondly, the excitation, separation and capture of charge carries determine the utilization of solar energy and quantum efficiency, which depend on the electronic structures of catalysts and transfer capacity of charge carries. 1) The excitation of charge in a semiconductor is closely related to its unique electronic structures as the energy of the incident light should be higher than its bandgap energy (Eg). To enhance the utilization rate of visible light, the bandgap of photocatalysts has to be narrowed by various strategies (i.e. doping heteroatom, inducing defect, discovering new wide spectrum photocatalysts and designing hierarchical photocatalysts). 2) The excited e−−h+ pairs can also be recombined to release the photon energy in the form of heat, competing with the separation of charges. Although the excitation of e−−h+ pairs via irradiation normally takes place within femtoseconds, the rest elementary steps are much slower (Fig. 1C) [21]. In the absence of A and D, both surface charge trapping and recombination of e−−h+ pairs take place within a time scale of 10–100 ns, leading to the competition between these two steps. The interfacial charges transfer to the surface-adsorbed electron acceptors (Aad) and donors (Dad) generally occur within microseconds to milliseconds, which are much slower than those of both charge trapping and recombination processes [5]. This explains the intrinsic low quantum efficiency (QE) of photocatalysis, thus engineering the surface properties of the material to slow down the recombination kinetics and speeding up the interfacial charge transfers are two possible approaches to improve the QE. 3) The capture of charges by Aad and Dad is electrocatalytic reactions which is driven by photogenerated charges in the CB or VB of semiconductor. The positions of CB and VB define the redox potential of the e−−h+ pairs of a photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 1B. A CB minimum (CBM) that is no larger than 0 vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is required for the reduction of proton (H2 evolution), whereas a greater VB maximum (VBM) than H2O or H2O2 oxidation potential is essential to O2 evolution. The large onset overpotential and sluggish kinetics significantly hinder the capture efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. Consequently, extensive efforts have been devoted to increase the number of active sites, enhance the intrinsic activity and achieve high confinement for enhancing the capture and utilization of electrons and holes. Thus heterogeneous photocatalyst systems normally require a minimum of two components to realize efficient H2 production: the semiconductor that absorbs the light and generates e−−h+ pairs, and the cocatalysts that accelerate the H2 evolution and O2 evolution. Therefore, the kinetics of elementary steps involved in photocatalytic reactions are key factors for designing high performance photocatalysts. More detailed illustration of the working principle and basic steps involved in the photocatalytic H2 evolution using a semiconductor photocatalyst can be found in other review papers [22–27]."
2,Adsorption and desorption of molecules,"As the essential steps of photocatalytic reactions, the identification of the chemisorption species, along with the dynamics of their formation and transformation, is preliminary to adequately understand the heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction and design photocatalysts with excellent performance. Currently, various experimental approaches are available to explore the adsorption and dissociation processes of reactant species on the heterogeneous photocatalysts, including STM, TPD, and XPS, thus guiding the design of photocatalyst materials. The interactions involving adsorption and dissociation of scavengers (EtOH, MeOH), H2O and O2, and desorption of H2 are investigated with these methods by many researchers."
3,Alcohol adsorption & dissociation,"3.1 Alcohol adsorption & dissociation The adsorption and dissociation/transformation of alcohols as scavengers have been studied in detail. Several research groups probed the adsorption and dissociation of alcohols, which were generally used as hole scavengers for H2 evolution [28–36]. Ethanol molecules can diffuse along the Ti trough, and the diffusion can be promoted by the adjacent H atoms on the partially hydrogenated TiO2 surface [29]. Femtosecond two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) observation shared by Ma et al. showed that ethanol was molecularly adsorbed on the TiO2 surface under irradiation instead of dissociative adsorption (Fig. 2 A) [28]. The dissociation of molecularly adsorbed ethanol and the formation of bridging hydroxyls took place after ˜10 s, as indicated by a peak located at 5.5 eV. TPD revealed that the main intermediate was CH3CHO during the photocatalytic EtOH dissociation (Fig. 2B), which can be described by Eqs. 1 and 2 [28]. Here the Ti subscript indicates the adsorbed species on the five-coordinated Ti atoms. The TPD signal of H2O (m/z = 18) is originated from the recombination of bridging hydroxyls, where the CH3CH2OTi further loses an OH and desorbs as ethylene. Such process is similar to that of methanol dissociation that requires less energy [32]. (1) CH 3 CH 2 OH Ti +hv→ CH 3 CH 2 O Ti + HO br (2) CH 3 CH 2 O Ti +hv→ CH 3 CH O Ti + HO br The adsorption and dissociation of ethanol on the TiO2 surface has also been studied by STM imaging [30]. The ethanol molecules were firstly trapped at the bridging oxygen vacancy (VObr) sites and then dissociated into EtObr (Fig. 2C and D), which was confirmed by DFT calculations (Fig. 2E and F) [30]. Martinez et al. observed the dissociation of ethanol on the O vacancies at the <111>R step edges (VOs) (Fig. 2G) [31]. The adsorption and dissociation energy barriers of ethanol on the Ti atoms at the step edges (EtOHS–Ti) or VOs (EtOHS) were shown in Fig. 2H. Apparently the dissociation of EtOHS–Ti has to overcome huge energy barriers compared to that of the dissociation of EtOHS, indicating that the active sites for the ethanol dissociation was located at the VOs. The ethoxides on the Ti troughs react with h+ species to finally produce acetaldehyde [37]. Meanwhile, a TPD study combined with DFT calculation suggested that methanol undergoes the photo-dissociation via OH and CH bond cleavage [33]. Moreover, methanol can be converted into acetic acid (HCOOCH3) under continuous irradiation, where the CH3O and CH2O species were photogenerated stepwise and subsequently combined into acetic acid via the cross coupling reaction [38]. Interestingly, the cleavage of alcohols is sensitive to the identity of metals on the semiconductor, thus resulting in different products [34–36]. Whilst Pd and Pt NPs tended to facilitate the break of OH bond, Rh NPs favored the CC bond cleavage [34,35]. The dissociation of methanol was found to take place on the periphery of Pt NPs on the TiO2 (111) surface, where methyl was first generated and then migrated to the Ti rows on the TiO2 surface [36]. Since the adsorbed alcoholic intermediates (i.e., ethoxy) can react with the hole species, thus reducing the recombination of photoexcited charge carriers, the aforementioned mechanism analysis from atomic scale have to be considered in the design of photocatalyst materials. According to above reforming process of alcohols, the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the presence of α-H atoms in scavengers. Namely, the more α-H atoms, the higher H2 production rate because of more holes consumption in photoreaction. Thus, the number of α-H atom for the alcohols can serve as a reference in the choice of scavengers under the premise of eliminating the toxic effect of product for photocatalyst materials."
4,Water adsorption & dissociation,"3.2 Water adsorption & dissociation Water as the reactant of photocatalytic reaction could dissociate to generate H and OH species on the photocatalysts, afterwards, the H species could capture photo-excited electrons to produce hydrogen. Accordingly, the interaction (adsorption and dissociation) between water and TiO2 has also been explored [39–41]. Water molecules do not dissociate on the defect-free rutile TiO2 (110) surface with a coverage higher than 0.5 ML [39]. The molecular adsorption of water on rutile TiO2 (110) surface is more favorable than dissociative chemisorption, which agrees well with the TPD observations [42]. It was found that the location of O vacancies (VO) in anatase TiO2 (101) surface is crucial to water dissociation [43]. The HOH bond breaking was observed on the defective TiO2 surface using STM [41]. Early investigation by Schaub et al. proposed that the sole active site for water dissociation is the VObr [44]. However, recent study found that the number of dissociated water molecules cannot be adequately understood with VObr as the only active site. Water adsorption on the terraces and steps of TiO2 with a high step density was studied (Fig. 3 A) [40]. The density of Had atoms is twice as that of total VO after H2O exposure, indicating that both VObr and VOs act as active sites for water dissociation (Fig. 3B). What is more, the surface VO becomes more stable in the presence of water compared to the subsurface counterpart, which facilitates the migration of VO from the subsurface to the surface (Fig. 3C and D) [43]. The subsurface VO promotes water dissociation directly via forming surface VO indirectly. Besides, the adsorption energy of OH intermediate species can be increased by doping S atoms into the lattice of C3N4, which can lower the free energy change of water dissociation [45]. The VOintroduction and heteroatom doping to improve the catalytic performance via HOH bond breaking can provide additional protons for photocatalytic H2 evolution, offering another strategy to design photocatalyst materials. Moreover, the interaction between water and semiconductor can tune electronic structure of photocatalysts and absorbed species. Water adsorption on the InVO4 surface leads to a shrinking of the In–In and In–V distance at the surface, suggesting an enhanced electron mobility [46]. As for the effect of water adsorption on the structure and electronic properties of g-C3N4, one side adsorbed water can turn flat structured g-C3N4 sheet owing an indirect bandgap into buckle structured g-C3N4 with a direct bandgap [47]. Water-assisted holes trapping effect on semiconductor enables photogenerated electrons to live longer for reduction of electrons while the trapped holes are employed to water oxidation. It was observed that OH groups bound on semiconductor are able to trap holes and the coordinated water at low-coordinated TiOH site can further enhance holes trapping ability of OH groups by electron transfer from 3a1 molecular orbital of water to O 2p orbital of OH [48]. Meanwhile, the interfacial interaction of water with metal cocatalysts were also investigated to give more basic knowledge of heterogeneous catalysts. The interplay between water and Pt as the common co-catalysts have been also investigated, and then observed the formation of OHPt on Pt (111) [49]. And the adsorption of water on Pt (111) can induce the electrons transfer from 1b1 orbital of water to Pt and the formation of hydrogen bonding between water molecules [50]."
5,"Oxygen adsorption, dissociation & desorption","3.3 Oxygen adsorption, dissociation & desorption A better understanding of the interaction between O2 and semiconductor is critical for the design of photocatalyst materials, as O2 will be produced during water splitting and can capture photo-generated electrons. VO and 5-fold coordinated Ti atoms (Ti5c) are the O2 adsorption sites on TiO2 surface, where VO is more favorable for O2 adsorption than Ti5c [51]. However, note that the two adsorbed O2 species behaves differently upon UV radiation. The O2 on VO undergoes photo-desorption when light is commenced, whereas the O2 on Ti5c sites experiences photo-dissociation at low O2 coverage (<0.05 ML) [52]. It was therefore supposed that the O2 photo-desorption can be described as a hole-mediated process, where the chemisorbed O2 anions reacts with photogenerated holes, forming neutral O2 molecules and then desorbing from the TiO2 surface [53]. Moreover, the surface morphology of TiO2 also strongly influences the adsorption-desorption properties of O2 [54]. The O2 TPD spectra of three different TiO2 surfaces (Fig. 4 A) suggested that more O2 can be desorbed from the flat (110) surface than that of the two stepped surfaces. Many publications have demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of oxide can be improved by thermal reduction due to the introduction of VO induced, whereas the VO is not stable on account of healing by O2. The O2 dissociation is an electron-mediated process, where an O2 obtained an electron thus leading to the healing of a VO and creation of an O adatom [53]. The O2 thermal dissociation on TiO2 with controlled surface VO density was studied by TPD and STM imaging (Fig. 4B–D), and found that O2 can be dissociated at both Ti troughs and VObr [55]. The bright spots on the surface were TiOx (x ≈ 2) islands that were created by the adsorbed oxygen species (Oad) reacting with Ti interstitials. A larger average size of the TiOx islands observed for the high-reduced TiO2 than that for the low-reduced TiO2 revealed that more O2 can react with Ti interstitials on high-reduced TiO2 surfaces. Correlation between the reactivity and VObr density has been further rationalized by TPD (Fig. 4B). The amount of desorbed O2 gradually increased with increasing the VObr density (6–8% ML), then reached to the maximum at ˜8.3% ML, and dropped sharply at a high VObr density (8.5–10% ML). The drop of O2 TPD signal at the high VObr density suggested that more Ti3+ can react with the O species on highly reduced TiO2. Black TiO2 have attracted plenty of attention with oxygen vacancy (Ti3+) due to excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light. To maintain the catalytic activity of black TiO2, the O2 concentration of the photocatalytic reaction system should be extremely low. In addition to the aforementioned cases for pure semiconductor surfaces, the interaction between O2 and metal supported on the semiconductor was also investigated using synchrotron XPS (Fig. 4E) [56]. Interestingly, the O 1s peak shift can be solely associated to the band bending caused by the charge transfer from TiO2 to O2 (Eqs. 3 and 4), as the Au 4f peak remained unchanged (no donation or acceptance of charges). (3) O 2 gas ⇋ O 2 (ads) (4) O 2 ads + e - TiO 2 ⇋ O 2 - (ads) Considering the competitive reduction of H+ and O2 by the photo-generated electrons as well as the cure of VO, O2 reduction should be minimized during the construction of photocatalyst for H2 evolution by engineering the surface properties of both semiconductor and promoter."
6,Hydrogen desorption,"3.4 Hydrogen desorption The understanding of hydrogen desorption on photocatalysts is of fundamental importance to clearly describe the reaction process of photocatalysis. Comparing the STM images of hydroxyl covered (H atom adsorbed) surface before and after 90 min UV irradiation (Fig. 5 A and B), the hydroxyl disappear from the rutile TiO2 (011) surface [57]. In addition, no Vo were observed from the STM image, indicating that H atoms desorbed as H2 molecules instead of combination with lattice oxygen to generate H2O molecules. However, the hydroxyls still exist for the hydroxyl covered rutile (110) surface after UV irradiation. These phenomena suggested that the rutile (011) surface of TiO2 may show a better photocatalytic H2 evolution performance than rutile (110) surface. The interaction of hydrogen with co-catalysts is a significant descriptor for the choice of co-catalysts in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis. If the binding between H adatom and co-catalyst is too weak, the hydrogen is not readily captured by photocatalysts, whereas a too strong binding results in difficult desorption from photocatalysts. The different hydrogen adsorption free energy for metal co-catalysts mean discrepant catalytic activity. And the shift of hydrogen adsorption free energy after the adding of graphene demonstrated the carbon material was also a candidate of co-catalysts [58]. The evolution of hydrogen adsorption and desorption also can guide the design of bimetallic co-catalysts. The desorption of hydrogen molecules on Cu was easily in spite of difficulty for H atoms adsorption [59]. In contrast, Ni can capture H atoms easily. The alloying engineering of Cu and Ni can skillfully obtain a high hydrogen atoms adsorption energy and a low hydrogen molecules desorption energy for Cu60Ni40 alloy co-catalysts, contributing to a superior co-catalytic performance (Fig. 5C). The researches on the interaction of reactant/product species with photocatalysts and co-catalysts provide significant insights into the heterogeneous catalytic reactions occurring on photocatalysts surfaces. More attention has been concentrated to the influence of various strategies on the electronic structure and charges separation. Actually, the modulation of adsorption and desorption for reactant/product species on photocatalysts induced by the engineered strategies can supply additional information for the design of heterogeneous photocatalysts, i.e. the local arrangements of reactant/product species and the proximities to critical surfaces sites. For one thing, all the crystal texture, composition and defect of photocatalysts or co-catalysts affect the adsorption and desorption, and further then alter photocatalytic reaction pathway and reaction rate. For another thing, the adsorption and desorption of reactant/product species can change the electronic structure of catalysts and prolong the lifetime of charges. Consequently, a depth investigation on the interaction of adsorbates with photocatalysts surface is critical to comprehensively evaluate the various design strategies of heterogeneous photocatalysts."
7,"Excitation, separation and capture of charges","In addition to the adsorption and desorption process, the excitation, separation and capture of charges carries are other important steps for heterogeneous photocatalysis. As mentioned previously, the excitation wavelengths of photocatalysts are determined by the bandgap of semiconductors whereas the band position decides whether electrons/holes can be captured by H+/H2O. Noticeably, the rapid recombination of photo-excited charge carriers hinders the development of H2 evolution. Pelaez et al. probed that the trapping event of photo-generated radicals took place within ˜30 ps, and 90% of charge carriers recombined within 10 ns [60]. Similar phenomenon was observed on bulk GaP material by Lubberhuizen et al., where the majority of photogenerated charge carriers recombined within 20 ns [61]. Many attempts have been tried to enhance the photocatalytic performance by engineering the morphology, microstructure, polymorph composition. However, the photocatalytic performance of the physically-modified semiconductor were still far from satisfactory, thus further optimizing the excitation, separation and capture steps of charge carries by tuning electronic structures and transfer are crucial."
8,Excitation of charges,"4.1 Excitation of charges Many photocatalysts can only be excited with ultraviolet light occupying ˜4% of solar energy and the visible light taking up 43% of solar energy is useless in these catalytic systems. Due to the low utilization of solar energy, great efforts have been made to promote photocatalysts capable of using abundant visible light. Many strategies have been applied to improve the excitation efficiency by engineering the electronic structure of catalysts, developing wide spectrum photocatalysts and designing hierarchical photocatalysts. In recent years, in spite of the traditional photocatalysts, 2D materials with narrow bandgap like transition metal dichalcogenides [62] and C3N4 [63], have been used for hydrogen evolution or water splitting. In the theoretical aspect, the band edges of XAs (X = Si, Ge and Sn) with narrow bandgap span the water redox potentials at neutral environment, was potential candidate photocatalysts with high utilization rate of solar energy [64]. In addition, hierarchical photocatalysts can obtain enhanced light harvesting, contributing to the excitation of charges. It was attributed to longer light path for photocatalysts with hierarchical structure by light reflection and scattering [65]. Nevertheless, only depending on the design of hierarchical photocatalysts and development of wide spectrum photocatalysts is not sufficient to satisfy the practical application. Electronic structure of semiconductor is crucial for the exciting light range. DFT calculations have been extensively employed in calculating the electronic structures to predict the bandgaps and band positions of pristine and modified materials [66]. By revealing the density of states (DOS) of individual element that formed the semiconductor materials, the contribution of each element to the CBM and VBM can be extracted. For photocatalysts built with d0 cations (highest oxidation states) along with anions, the empty d orbitals of the cations and the full-filled p orbitals of the anions contributed to CBM and VBM in general (i.e., TiO2, V2O5, and Ta2N5) [22]. Meanwhile, the VBM of photocatalysts formed by d10 cations (highest oxidation states) with anions was originated from both the cation d orbitals and the anion p orbitals (i.e., ZnO and Ga2O3) [22]. However, variation in the oxidation states may result in changes in the electronic structures of complicated semiconductor photocatalysts. Based on these theories, utilizing element doping, defect introduction and strain introduction were applied to shift the CBM and VBM position, achieving the controllable management of electronic structure. 4.1.1 Element doping Both anionic (e.g. C, N, O, P, F) and cationic dopants (e.g. Cu, Cr, Rh, W, La) have been employed to tune the electrical structure [67]. Doping single element for extending the light absorption to cover visible light range has been employed for decades. The bandgap narrowing of tantalate perovskites (NaTaO3, ˜4.2 eV) by various dopants were calculated [66]. It was found that partially replacing O by N or I resulted in VBM shifting upward, and the doping of C reduced the potential of both CBM and VBM due to the C2pC2p excitation (Fig. 6 A). Related experiments demonstrated that N doped NaTaO3 indeed induced a change of bandgap from 4.0 eV to 3.7 eV [68]. It was further proved that the alteration of bandgap for semiconductor was a doping concentration dependent behavior. The UV–vis diffusion reflectance spectra (UV–DRS) of P doped TiO2 (Fig. 6B) revealed that lower doping concentration of P was more effective for the reduction of bandgap, whereas exorbitant doping resulted in blue shift of the absorption edge due to the suppression of crystal growth [69]. In addition to anionic doping, metal cations doping has been proved to be effective for bringing about visible absorption. BaTiO3 is a wide-gap semiconductor with a wide bandgap of ˜3.0 eV, nevertheless, Rh doped BaTiO3 showed an absorption band in visible light range on account of electron transitions from electron donor formed by Rh3+ to the CB composed of empty d orbitals. And it was capable to catalyst H2 evolution under visible light even without a sacrificial manner [70]. It should be noted that the improvement in photocatalytic activity for monodoping was generally limited due to the formation of localized states between the CB and VB, which can act as the electron-hole recombination centers [71]. Moreover, the change in band edge alignment of the doped systems may lead to variation of the oxidative and reductive power [72]. To overcome the disadvantage of monodoping, modifying the band structure of the photocatalysts by co-doping has been considered to be a promising strategy to narrow the bandgap while maintaining the ionic charge balance [73]. The co-doping of NW, LaC, CuSn, and PbI can narrow the bandgap of tantalate perovskites while reasonable photocatalytic performances can still be obtained [66]. Modak et al. investigated the band structure of WN co-doped NaTaO3 [74]. Since one electron deficiency created by replacing O2− with N3− can be compensated by replacing one Ta5+ with W4+, and the W 5d orbital had a lower energy compared to that of Ta 5d, the co-doping was expected to reduce the bandgap of NaTaO3 without reducing the number of charge carriers. Interestingly, it has been found that the distance between N and W atoms in the NaTaO3 structure (1.78 Å in ‘Str. I’ and 4.49 Å in ‘Str. II’) strongly influenced the electronic properties of the material, as revealed by the partial DOS (PDOS) plots and the band alignment (Fig. 6C and D). Note that the co-doping not only compensated the single doping effect (the Fermi level above the VB), also a significant bandgap reduction for ‘Str. II’ (2.67 eV) was observed, owing to the N 2p and W 5d that have contribution to the VB and CB, respectively. Such difference may arise from the bonding configurations of the metal atom to N atom (Ta–N–W in ‘Str. I’ and Ta–N–Ta in ‘Str. II’). Experimentally, the visible light adsorption of LaCr co-doped NaTaO3 originated from the doped Cr, meanwhile the doping of La can hinder the formation of Cr6+ which will consume electrons [75]. In addition to the co-doping of metal-metal and nonmetal-nonmetal elements, metal-nonmetal co-doping of semiconductor is also an effective strategy to induce superior visible light photocatalytic performance. Mishra et al. synthesized WN co-doped titania nanomaterials and demonstrated that the visible light absorption of photocatalyst does not merely depend on the N doping but also rely on W co-doping [76]. The co-doping of La and N could activate Sr2TiO4 for visible light photocatalytic water splitting by uplifting the VBM to narrow bandgap [77]. 4.1.2 Defect introduction Besides element doping, introducing defects is another effective strategy to modify the electronic structure. The calculated bandgap of La(OH)3 with Vo was 3.38 eV, which was much lower than 3.53 eV of pristine La(OH)3 [78]. DFT calculations revealed that a new impurity level below the CB was formed while the position of VB was unchanged. Sulfur vacancy (Vs) can alter the VB and CB together to engineer the bandgap of photocatalysts. The DOS of ZnCdS with Vs showed that two defect energy states occurred at above the CBM and below the VBM, respectively (Fig. 7 A and B) [79]. Theoretically, the bandgap of ZnCdS was narrowed by changing the CB and VB together due to the introduction of Vs. Many experimental works by creating VO to modify the electronic structure of the photocatalyst materials have been carried out. The anatase TiO2 (111) facet showed higher photocatalytic HER performance than other facets [80]. EPR analysis revealed that there were more paramagnetic Ti3+ centers (g = 2.002) on (111) facet than on (010), (101) and (001) facets (Fig. 7C). This can be associated to a higher density of VO on (111) facet owing to a higher density of under-coordinated O atoms (two-coordinated), as can be seen from the atomic structure (Fig. 7D). A new insight of the VO effect on H2 evolution was provided by controlling the spatial location of VO on K4Nb6O17. The presence of surface VO in the defective K4Nb6O17 can significantly increase the charge carrier density of K4Nb6O17, thus resulting in enhanced catalytic performance [81]. Moreover, a 0.2 eV reduction of the bandgap was observed for defective K4Nb6O17 compared to that of the defect-free counterpart due to a down shift of the CB. In addition, the presence of VO can also enhance the charge separation for SrTiO3 photocatalyst [82]. The ongoing attention has also been paid to the modulation of N defect as a high effective strategy in engineering the electronic structure. A facile 5 min thermal treatment in air could create large amount of defects in C3N4 [83], significantly narrowing the bandgap of materials (Fig. 8 A). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduction of N vacancies (VN) and cyano groups can induce the appearance of new light absorption edges and red-shift of intrinsic light absorption edges, respectively, resulting in remarkably extended light absorption in the visible light region (Fig. 8B). Compared with pristine C3N4, the activity of as-prepared C3N4 with N defect was improved by 21.5 times under visible light irradiation because of the extended visible light and weakened charge recombination. Apart from air-atmosphere treatment, the photocatalysts with rich VN can also be synthesized by the thermal treatment of H2, thus contributing to charges excitation. Two-coordinated VN for C3N4 are formed in the process of H2 treatment, leaving the neighboring C atoms with extra electrons [84]. And the hydrogen atoms occupation at VN site can further narrow the bandgap of C3N4 (Fig. 8C and D). In addition, HCl assisted exfoliation approach and hydrothermal-copolymerization have also been employed to prepare C3N4 with N defect [85,86] to obtain narrowed bandgap. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of element doping and defects can further enhance the photocatalytic performance [87]. For the N-doped La2Ti2O7 with the co-existence of VO, electronic structure analysis revealed that one O atom substituted by two N atoms and one VO created a continuum energy band above the VBM, in contrast to that of a mid-gap states formed by simply replacing one O atom with a N atom. Such a continuum band extended the light absorption without increasing the charge recombination kinetics, thus resulting in an enhanced visible light performance without diminishing the photocatalytic activity under UV light. 4.1.3 Strain introduction Applying strain on semiconductors is also a feasible method to tune the electronic structure of photocatalysts. The effects of strain on single layer structured Group-III monochal-cogenide (MX, M = Ga and In, X = S, Se, and, Te) materials were investigated [88]. Whilst the biaxial compressive strain increased the bandgap thus the driving force for redox reactions, a tensile force can reduce the bandgap for absorbing more visible light. Similarly, such effect has been also predicted on g-C3N4 and MoS2 [89,90]. The basal plane of the MoS2 can be activated by introducing strained VS. DFT calculation on the 2H-MoS2 revealed that introducing VS in the basal plane created new bands near the Fermi level, which can further shift towards the Fermi level with gradually increasing the tensile strain (Fig. 9 A), indicating that the optimum HER performance can be realized by controlling the VS concentration and strain intensity. Zheng et al. considered that the high HER activity observed for N-doped graphene on g-C3N4 may originate from the strain that introduced during electron transfer [91]. It was further proposed that the mechanical strain in g-C3N4 can be introduced via doping an isoelectronic silicon atom on the bridging carbon site, leading to substantial tuning of the HER performance of g-C3N4 at different coverage (Fig. 9B) [89]."
9,Separation of charges,"4.2 Separation of charges Although the modification of electronic structure can increase the utilization of visible light, the separation of photo-generated e−−h+ pairs is very important for the improvement of phtotocatalytic performance. Various methods are employed to enhance the separation of charge carriers to obtain photocatalysts with excellent performance, including the fabrication of unique nanostructures and interface engineering by the incorporation of foreign materials. The interface engineering has been widely applied to improve the charges separation [92], involving in Schottky junctions, heterojunctions and homojunctions. According to the separation mechanisms of charge carriers in various hybrid materials, the interfacial coupling can be classified into five types: Schottky junction (Fig. 10 A), Tpye II heterojunction (Fig. 10B), p-n heterojunction (Fig. 10C), direct Z-Scheme heterojunction (Fig. 10D) and homojunction [24]. For semiconductor-metal hybrid materials, the photo-generated electrons from semiconductor will migrate to metal surface due to a higher work function of metal than that of semiconductor, thus forming Schottky junction with upward band bending. In type II heterojunction system with staged band structures, the photogenerated electrons in CB of semiconductor 1 (S1) can be transferred to that of semiconductor 2 (S2), whereas the migratory direction of holes from VB is inverse, constructing a separation field of charges. Compared with II heterojunction, p-n heterojunction is capable of supplying an additional electric field to accelerate the charge carriers transfer. As for direct Z-scheme heterojunction, the photogenerated electrons in CB of S2 recombine with the photogenerated holes in VB of S1, leaving the photogenerated electrons in S1 and photogenerated holes in S2 for photocatalysis. So far, there are several categories of co-catalysts are employed to construct hybrid materials with junction: (1) metal/semiconductor or metal-like/ semiconductor to form Schottky junction, (2) metal sulfides/semiconductor, oxide/semiconductor, carbide/semiconductor, phosphide/semiconductor and non-metal/semiconductor to fabricate heterojunction, (3) different phases to create homojunction. 4.2.1 Fabrication of unique nanostructures The particle size and microstructure influence the diffusion length and subsequent lifetime of charge carriers [93]. Transient infrared spectroscopy revealed that the recombination of charge carriers on smaller WO3 was faster than that of large WO3 either under vacuum or in the presence of methanol (Fig. 11 A and B). Moreover, the identical lifetime of charge carriers under both conditions for large WO3 indicated that water adsorption was not the rate-limiting step for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on WO3. Interestingly, the particle size effect of α-Fe2O3 on water oxidation showed a different trend [94]. The over-potential for OER using Nano-Fe2O3 (+0.43 eV) was lower than that of Sonic-Fe2O3 (+0.63 eV), indicating that the injection of holes into water for Nano-Fe2O3 was easier due to a lower energy barrier (Fig. 11C). The hollow Fe2O3 hierarchical spheres showed excellent OER performance due to a short diffusion length for charges [9]. Besides, The onion-ring-like microstructure of C3N4 benefited to the diffusion of reactants onto active sites, in addition to the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes (Fig. 12 A and B) [95]. Well-ordered mesoporous TiO2 also favored the separation of photogenerated charges [96], confirmed by surface photovoltage spectra (Fig. 12C and D) [97]. 4.2.2 Introducing Schottky junctions However, the photocatalytic performance of the semiconductor with unique nanostructures were still far from satisfactory. The creation of Schottky junctions by adding metal or metal-like materials is an effective strategy to hinder the recombination photo-generated charges. During the past decade, a variety of metal or metal-like materials have been used as co-calayst to improve the photocatalytic performance of photoctalysts, including noble metals (e.g. Pd, Pt and Au), transitional metals (e.g. Ni, Co and Cu) and metal-like materials (e.g. graphene and carbon nanodots), as shown in Table 1 . (i) The interaction of co-catalyst and semiconductor The metal-semiconductor interaction has been extensively investigated by STM, with known fact that the metal nanoparticles (NPs) play important roles for H2 and O2 evolution as cocatalysts. Several researchers have focused on the interaction between the noble metal NPs and the TiO2 support [112,113]. Rieboldt et al. studied the influence of the reduced rutile (110) surface (r-TiO2) with VO, the oxidized rutile (110) surface (o-TiO2) with O on-top (Oot) atoms, and the rutile (110) surface with H adatoms (h-TiO2) on the distribution of Pt NPs by STM, as shown in Fig. 13 A–C [112]. It was found that small Pt NPs were distributed homogeneously with high density on r-TiO2 and o-TiO2, and large Pt NPs were preferentially found at the step edges on the h-TiO2 surface with low density [112]. Similarly, large Au and Ag NPs were also observed on h-TiO2 compared to that on r-TiO2 and o-TiO2 (Fig. 13D and E) [113]. This phenomenon can be ascribed to a higher mobility of the metal atoms (or clusters) on the h-TiO2 surface than on the r-TiO2 and o-TiO2 surfaces, thus leading to the aggregation of smaller NPs [112]. DFT calculations revealed that Pt atoms bound at VO and Oot were more stable compared to separated Pt atoms, thus restricting the diffusion of Pt atoms on r-TiO2 and o-TiO2 surfaces [112]. In contrast, Pt atoms trapped by the H adatoms (PtH) exhibited similar diffusion energy barrier to that of Pt fixed on the h-TiO2 surface (0.50 eV vs. 0.33 eV), implying the higher mobility of PtH. The supported metal NPs also exhibited different physical properties depending on the identity of the metal species [114]. Whilst the deposition of Co on TiO2 (111) resulted in smaller Co cluster with higher density, the deposited Au, Ni and Pt clusters on the same surface showed larger particle size with less nucleation sites due to their higher mobility [114]. These studies suggested that the particle sizes of the metal NPs can be tuned by modifying the surface properties of the semiconductor or alloying with other metals, which could guide the synthesis of controlled metal cocatalysts. For the formation of bimetallic NPs on semiconductor, one has to consider the diffusion of the metals from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives on different semiconductor supports [115]. The formation of AucorePdshell NPs using STM imaging and low energy ion scattering (LEIS), and found that Pd was initially deposited as clusters on the bare areas of substrate rather than on the existing Au clusters. A subsequent annealing was required to activate the migration of Pd toward the surface of Au NPs, forming the core–shell structures [116]. The interaction between metallic oxide (i.e., RuO2, IrO2) and semiconductor is also crucial for the improvement of photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. The growth of RuO2 (110) surface on rutile TiO2 (110) surface followed a stepwise manner, where the initially formed RuO2 nano-islands were gradually merged and eventually turned into large RuO2 terraces [117]. A Schottky barrier of 1.4 eV was formed at the interface that was induced by the band bending of TiO2 (1.2 eV), which could facilitate charge transfer and separation of the photo-generated e−−h+ pairs. It should be also pointed out that the RuO2 (110)−TiO2 (110) interface is a promising model system to study the OER process, as the RuO2 grows with the same lattice constants as TiO2 to give a well-defined interface. Since the loading, microstructure and chemical composition of the metal NPs supported on semiconductor can affect the photocatalytic H2 production [98], the knowledge in metal-semiconductor interaction derived from surface science studies provides crucial guideline for the design and synthesis of metal decorated photocatalysts. (ii) Creating Schottky junctions for hydrogen production and water splitting Employing noble metal (i.e. Pd, Pt and Au) NPs as cocatalysts can effectively improve the charge separation thus increase the photocatalytic activity [98,118]. The strong metal-support interaction can prevent the recombination of charge carriers, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity [118]. The kinetics of the excited electrons can be manipulated by tuning the composition and structure of the metal NPs (Fig. 14 A) [98]. Whilst the PdShell−AuCore (PdSAuC) structured NPs showed an optimum reduction rate constant (k red), the reversed trapping rate constant (krev ) of the excited electrons decreased with the increase of Pd content. Kinetic analysis indicated that the PdSAuC could yield an optimized ability in extracting the trapped electrons for reduction reactions, which was consistent with the measured H2 evolution rates. Later on this was proved by Han et al., who observed similar synergistic trend when using AuPd bimetallic NPs as the cocatalyst to modify g-C3N4 [99]. We also demonstrated that the selectivity of the reduction reaction can be realized by tuning the composition of the metallic cocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 14B [100]. While using Au and Ag monometallic NPs as cocatalyst promoted the reduction of H+ and O2, respectively, the Aucore−Agshell NPs showed no selectivity for the reduction of H+ and O2. Based on this discovery, appropriate cocatalysts need to be designed aiming at selectively reducing H+ for water splitting. Besides, the H2 oxidation, which is the reversed reaction of HER, has to be minimized. The Pt NPs with a higher oxidation state (PtO) can impede the H2 oxidation while still providing effective reaction sites for H2 generation [101]. This can be seen in Fig. 14C that a negligible H2 oxidation in the dark was achieved for PtO/TiO2, whereas Pt/TiO2 quickly oxidized the generated H2. Xing et al. also reported that the performance of Pt/TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 evolution could be related to the Pt oxidation state rather than the particle size [102]. The interplay between metal NPs and the semiconductor should also be considered for the design of photocatalysts. From the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of Pd–TiO2 [103], it was discovered that larger TiO2 with high crystallinity tended to supply more surface trapping sites for the excited electrons (near-surface Ti3+), while TiO2 with smaller size or low crystallinity provided more bulk trapping sites (bulk Ti3+). Obviously the surface trapped electrons were more feasible for charge transfer from the semiconductor to the metal for proton reduction. Moreover, the addition of Pd in middle-sized TiO2 can significantly reduce the amount of surface O 2 ∙- species, hindering the undesired H2 oxidation. Although most studies considered that noble metal NPs were the reaction sites for H2 evolution, Joo et al. proposed an alternative mechanism, claiming that the reduction of H+ occurred on the semiconductor. Then the surface adsorbed H was transferred to the metal sites to generate molecular H2 (Fig. 14D) [119]. Low cost transitional metals (i.e. Ni, Co and Cu) have also been examined as cocatalysts for H2 evolution [120,121]. After location of Ni nanoparticles with high crystallinity, the Schottky junction with built-in electrical potential formed at the interface of Ni and semiconductor can effectively improve the separation of charge carriers [104]. The fast hole transfer induced by loading Ni as cocatalysts also can confer high photo stability for CdS [105]. The activity of LaxNa1-xTaO3 was increased 9.3 times with nanosized Ni as a cocatalyst [106]. The performance of mesoporous Nb2O5 can be enhanced by four times via Cu modification [107]. It is generally considered that the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency could be significantly improved if the four-electron OER half reaction can be realized via a two-electron process. Moreover, Fe and Cu NPs can be used as the cocatalyst for g-C3N4 to realize overall water splitting via the two-electron process [11]. This strategy opens a new thought in the design of photocatalyst materials. Recently, metal carbide have also been used as cocatalysts (i.e., Mxene) for photocatalysis. The Schottky junction formed between MXene and semiconductor can enhance the separation of electrons and holes because of the metallic conductivity of MXene. The famous “Volcano plots” proposed by Nørskov et al. is an excellent theory to guide the design of cocatalysts for HER [122]. This theory was derived from the Sabatier principle, which has been extensively used in describing the correlation between the catalytic performance and the binding energies (or free energies for adsorption, ΔG) of the intermediates on the catalyst surface. An optimum performance is expected with moderate binding energies of reactive intermediates. In the case of HER, an intermediate ΔG for the surface adsorbed H on the catalyst (ΔG H = 0) would be ideal for an optimised performance. This strategy has been successfully used to guide the design of various promoters for HER [89]. In Fig. 15 A, the calculated free-energy diagram of HER demonstrated that the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate state (intermediate adsorbed H*) for O-terminated Ti3C2 were close to zero (|ΔG H*| = 0.00283 eV), which is even much lower than that of Pt and active sulfide [108]. The excellent HER performance of O-terminated Ti3C2 modified CdS2 can be ascribed to the charge separation and transfer. In Ti3C2/CdS2 system, the excited electrons in the CB of CdS can migrate to Ti3C2 leaving the holes in the VB of CdS, but the electrons cannot be transferred back to CdS due to the proper Schottky junction formed between Ti3C2 and CdS2 (Fig. 15B). The photoluminescence and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra revealed the high separation efficiency of charge carriers for the MXene-based Schottky junction (Fig. 16 ) [123]. Besides, the Ti3C2 also can restrain the hole-induced photocorrosion of CdS by the strong interaction between Ti3C2 and Cd2+ to confine Cd2+ ions [124]. These virtues endowed MXene as an excellent cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic acivity and stability of semiconductor. Dual co-catalysts of MXene and noble metal further boosted the catalytic activity of photoctalysts due to the synergetic effects. The loading of Ti3C2 along with Pt on C3N4 as co-catalysts effectively facilitated the separation of photogenerated carries via step-by-step electron transfer from C3N4 to Ti3C2 and then to Pt [109]. As a novel type of carbon material, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) is an alternative non-metal co-catalysts for water splitting to prevent the recombination of electrons and holes. The C3N4 nanotubes decorated with CQDs (Fig. 17 A) exhibited effective separation of electron–hole pairs, because of the high photocarrier transfer kinetics to drive electron-hole separation induced by the Schottky junction (Fig. 17B). [110] The photocatalytic water splitting can be processed via a two-electron process with H2O2 as the intermediate by using carbon nanodots (CDots) modified C3N4 photocatalyst [111]. The photogenerated H2O2 from H2O by C3N4 can be efficiently decomposed into O2 by the CDots cocatalyst, thus avoiding the photocatalyst being poisoned. 4.2.3 Constructing heterojunctions with other semiconductor materials In the past decades, the creation of heterojunction interfaces has been widely applied to improve the charges separation. The typical examples of heterojunction photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution or water splitting constructed by loading other semiconductors as co-catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . (i) Creating heterojunctions with metal based semiconductor Unfortunately, the high price and scarcity of noble metal limits the wider application of noble metal co-catalyst. In recent years, many researchers have extensively attempted to use inexpensive and abundant metal sulfides as photocatalytic co-catalysts. Xu et al. prepared CdS–ZnWO4 n-n heterojunction and found that the recombination kinetics can be tuned by varying the CdS content, as shown in photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 18 A [125]. The PL intensity of all CdS–ZnWO4 heterojunction was lower than that of pure ZnWO4 and reached a minimum for CdS–b-ZnWO4 (30 mol% of ZnWO4), indicating the sulphide-semiconductor heterojunctions can effectively improve the charge separation. Similarly, as for WS2 on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-CN) composite, the addition of WS2 significantly reduced the charge recombination (PL spectra in Fig. 18B) [126]. Nevertheless, MoS2 has also been considered as an efficient promoter for H2 evolution and has been employed to modify C3N4 [127,128]. Such improvement can be attributed to the appropriate alignment of the CB and VB between the photocatalyst and sulphide, which facilitates hole trapping at the sulfide sites via interfacial charge transfer. Hierarchical tandem heterojunctions constituted by multiple semiconductor can further improve the charges separation by a bridge. For TiO2/MoS2/CdS integrated tandem system, the work function data (Fig. 18C) revealed that the electrons from TiO2 and CdS easily escaped to MoS2 for photocatalytic H2 evolution, facilitating the charge separation and prolong lifetime of charges (Fig. 18D) [129]. The combination of metal and sulphide as cocatalyst could further enhance photocatalytic HER performance [130]. Yu et al. designed a sandwich structured photocatalyst, which constitutes of the Au@CdS core–shell cocatalyst and the SrTiO3 semiconductor (Au@CdS/SrTiO3) [131]. Fig. 19 A demonstrates that the PL spectra of Rhodamine B (RhB) can be quenched in the presence of photocatalyst, and the Au@CdS/SrTiO3 showed the maximum inhibition effect over the whole excitation range, indicating that the recombination of photo-excited charge carriers was minimized by using the Au@CdS core–shell cocatalyst. The mechanism of enhanced charge separation was summarized into the scheme shown in Fig. 19B. Under visible light radiation, free electrons generated from the plasmonic photosensitized Au were transferred to the CB of SrTiO3, leaving the Au sites being electron deficient and eventually compensated by the free electrons from the photo-excited CdS. What’s more, metal oxide is another alternative photocatalytic co-catalyst. Hollow FeTiO3−TiO2 hierarchical spheres with tunable ratio of Ti:Fe were prepared by Han et al. [132]. Linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study (Fig. 20 A and B) showed that a minimized charge transfer resistant was observed for the sample with a Ti:Fe ratio of 1:0.75, demonstrating that the formation of heterojunctions facilitated the charge migration. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of DMPO-·OH and DMPO-·O2 − can be used as the indicator of holes and electrons to explore the mechanism of charges separation. As for the WO3/g-C3N4 heterojunction, the photogenerated electrons and holes exists in the CB of g-C3N4 and VB of WO3, respectively, consistent with Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism (Fig. 20 C–E) [133]. The overall water splitting can be achieved using CaTaO2N modified with Rh/Cr bimetallic oxide cocatalyst under visible light radiation [134]. The strategy of applying two different metal oxide cocatalysts for both HER and OER has been investigated. Maeda et al. prepared the GaN:ZnO modified with Rhcore−Cr2O3shell and Mn3O4 as the promoters for HER and OER, respectively (Fig. 21 A and B) [135]. The reversed reaction of water splitting can be hindered due to the presence of the Cr2O3 shell, thus making the performance of GaN:ZnO loaded with Rhcore−Cr2O3shell and Mn3O4 higher than that of GaN:ZnO modified with either Rhcore−Cr2O3shell or Mn3O4. Besides, the Z-scheme architecture is also a promising strategy for achieving the overall water splitting by using two different semiconductors and a reversible shuttle redox mediator. Maeda et al. developed the Z-scheme water splitting system based on rhodium-doped barium titanate perovskite loaded with Pt (Pt/BaTiO3:Rh) and PtOx-loaded WO3, which were used as the HER and OER photocatalysts, respectively [70]. What’s more, metal phosphide has attracted considerable research as co-catalysts to separate the photogenerated charge carries. The p-type Cu3P has been coupled with g-C3N4 to fabricate p-n heterjunctions, as shown in Fig. 22 A [136]. The photogenerated electrons of Cu3P could transfer to the surface of g-C3N4 and the holes migrated from the g-C3N4 to Cu3P. After loading Cu3P, the average lifetime of charges was increased from 11.451 ns to 14.062 ns (Fig. 22B and C), revealing the effective separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, the existence of robust chemical interaction between Cu3P and g-C3N4 significantly suppressed the charge trapping by the g-C3N4 trap band, allowing more active photoelectrons to be captured by protons (Fig. 23 ) [137]. The introduction of CNT by dispersing Cu3P on CNT can further enhance the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers on account of excellent conductivity [138]. (ii) Creating heterojunctions with non-metal semiconductor Additionally, black phosphorus is alternative non-metal co-catalysts to fabricate heterojunction. Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQD) were used as hole migration cocatalysts of C3N4 on account of a high hole mobility of ˜105 cm2 V−1 s−1, signiﬁcantly improving the separation of the interfacial free carriers [139]. As shown in Fig. 24 A, the CBM and the VBM of black phosphorus-C3N4 were contributed by g-C3N4 and black phosphorus. Namely, the photogenerated electrons and holes would migrate to the g-C3N4 and BPQD, respectively (Fig. 24B–D), thus showing excellent photocatalytic performance. Ran et al. employed few-layer phosphorene as cocatalysts of CdS for hydrogen production with visible light irradiation. The superior activity originated from the matched electronic structure for phosphorene and CdS, excellent charge mobility and rich exposed active sites of phosphorene (Fig. 24E and F) [140]. 4.2.4 Forming homojunctions with different phases of semiconductor Furthermore, different phases of semiconductors can form homojunctions. TiO2 exists as three major phases of anatase, rutile and brookite. Anatase and rutile are two polymorphs co-existing in the benchmarking Aeroxide® P25 and other high performance TiO2 based photocatalysts [141]. The model predicted the ionisation potentiald (IP) of rutile and anatase to be 7.83 and 8.30 eV, respectively, where such offset of the IP between rutile and anatase made the rutile VBM ˜0.47 eV higher than that of anatase (Fig. 25 A). Combining with the calculated electron affinities (EA) of rutile (4.8 eV) and anatase (5.1 eV), the apparent bandgap for the rutile/anatase heterojunction was estimated to be ˜2.78 eV, which was significantly lower than either anatase (3.2 eV) or rutile (3.0 eV) alone. The calculation results agreed well with the XPS alignment on sol-gel synthesized TiO2 mixtures (Fig. 25B), suggesting that the photogenerated electrons flew from rutile to anatase thus facilitated the charge separation. Similarly, the photocatalytic overall water splitting using Ga2O3 can be enhanced by forming homojunctions between different phases [142]. The α–β Ga2O3 junctions prepared by tuning the calcination temperature (Fig. 25C) exhibited significant improvement in charge separation according to the time-resolved absorption spectra (Fig. 25D). Lately, zero-dimensional (0D)/two-dimensional (2D) phase heterojunction was exploited by Peng et al. who successfully sysnthesized 0D/2D phase heterojunction of Bi4MoO9 quantum dots/Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with effective separation and transfer of photo-generated carries [143]."
10,Capture & utilization of charges,"4.3 Capture & utilization of charges The capture of charges is also believed as a critical step in photocatalysis. The accumulation of charge carries induced by sluggish capture of charge carriers can accelerate the undesired side reaction and reduce the utilization of charges carriers, significantly decreasing the catalytic activity. Various methods have been employed to accelerate the surfaces capture of charge carries, such as increasing the number of active sites, enhancing the intrinsic activity and achieving high dispersion/confinement. Apart from enhancing the excitation and separation of charges, the loading of heteroatoms and co-catalysts, the creating of defects also can supply more active sites to accelerate the capture of charge carriers. As a frequently-used co-catalyst in phtocatalysis, the active sites of MoS2 is the coordinately unsaturated S atoms located at the edges of MoS2, whereas most S atoms on the basal plane are inert in catalysis. The unsaturated S atoms serve as active sites bond with H+, and the bound H+ can capture the electron easily [144]. The substitute of Mo atoms by Co atoms can create more unsaturated S atoms at the edge and on the basal plane, as shown in Fig. 26 A, then accelerate the capture of electrons for hydrogen evolution. The Electron spin resonance (EPR) spectrum (Fig. 26B) demonstrated the existence of S vacancies as a format of defect in defect-rich O-incorporated 1T-MoS2 (DRM) [145]. For defect-rich O-incorporated 1T-MoS2 and defect-free O-incorporated 1T-MoS2 (DFM), the introduction of defect can double the density of active sites (2.021 × 10−3 mol g−1 and 1.114 × 10−3 mol g−1, respectively), being beneficial to the capture of photo-generated electrons (Fig. 26C). Notably, the appropriate choice of scavenger solutions can effectively improve the intrinsic activity of photocatalysts by the efficient capture of charges. As for chalcogenide semiconductors, negligible H2 was generated with Na2S or Na2SO3 alone as scavenger due to the competitive capture of electrons by intermedium S2 2− and the powerless capture of holes by SO3 2− [146]. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced distinctly in the coexistence of Na2S and Na2SO3 because of the efficient capture of electrons and holes, embodying as a higher turnover frequency (TOF). In addition, the quantum confinement effect of nanosheet materials induced by ultimate two-dimensional anisotropy can prolong the charges lifetime and then offered more opportunities for the capture of electrons by H+, along with increased redox ability of charges, thus improving the utilization of charge carriers [147]."
11,Conclusion and perspective,"In this review, we have summarized recent progresses in the understanding of photocatalytic H2 evolution and water splitting processes from reactants adsorption (non-dissociation and dissociation), surface reactions, and product desorption. The adsorption and desorption of molecules as the essential elementary steps could influence the reaction rate and direction of next steps, considering about the concentration and forms of adsorbed species. In the past decades, molecular-level approaches have provided important insights into the adsorption and desorption processes for heterogeneous photocatalysis occurring on the surface and photocatalysts. The interaction of molecules, such as water, ethanol, methanol, oxygen, hydrogen, with photocatalysts has been investigated by various surface science approaches. It was found that the adsorption of water on semiconductor can change the electronic structure of photocatalysts, i.e. the transformation of indirect bandgap to direct bandgap and lifetime of charges, while the interaction of reactant/product molecules with photocatalysts can provide a significant reference in the choice of scavengers, co-catalysts and crystal texture. The UV-light excitation, rapid recombination of charge carries and sluggish capture of charge carriers are three major bottlenecks for large-scale applications of photocatalysis. During the past 40 years, the family of photocatalysts materials have been extended from traditional TiO2 to various materials. Heteroatoms doping and defect creation are effective strategies of engineering electronic structure to narrow the bandgap and match with the redox potential of hydrogen and/or oxygen evolution. Except for surface modification of semiconductor, various materials such as g-C3N4, Ta3N5, CdS, perovskite, carbon dots and MXene have been employed as photocatalysts or co-catalysts to effectively harvest visible light for hydrogen evolution and water splitting. In recent years, metallic MXene and functionalized MXene have shown extraordinary talents in hydrogen evolution and water splitting. The interface engineering of constructing Schottky junction, heterojunction and homejunction by loading various co-catalysts have demonstrated to be able to significantly enhance the separation of photogenerated e−−h+ pairs and prolong the life time of charge carriers. Moreover, the introduction of co-catalysts and defect creation can also alter the charges capture, then kinetically suppressing the backward reaction of hydrogen evolution. In spite of these significant developments, some inadequacies still need to be improved to guide the design of high performance photocatalysts. For the investigation of adsorption and desorption steps, more efforts should be focused on alternative photocatalyst materials other than TiO2, although it is more technically challenged than that of studying the well-defined rutile (110) surface. Moreover, the interaction of reactant molecules and co-catalyst attached on semiconductor need to be explored. These observations will provide more comprehensive knowledge for the elementary steps of photocatalysis. As for the surface reaction steps of heterogeneous photocatalysis, many mechanism analysis of strategies for photocatalysis is mainly based on the theoretical calculations. More efforts should be aimed at employing in-situ spectroscopy methods to investigate the charge separation, storage, and utilization kinetics, as well as reaction pathways and RDS of different photocatalyst materials. Importantly, it should also be noted that a comprehensive understanding of the photocatalytic water splitting process cannot be obtained by one elementary step and therefore calls for the coupling of every elementary step. In generally, a comprehensive and deep understanding for each elementary step of photocatalysis can help us elucidate the reaction mechanism of H2 evolution and water splitting. Utilizing these knowledge, we can optimize existing photocatalysts and search for new photocatalyst materials to achieve the industrial applications of photocatalysis."
