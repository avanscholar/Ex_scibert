0,Introduction,"Renewable carbon resources have a great potential for the production of chemicals and transportation fuels. Reductive hydrogenolysis of esters derived from biomass has received growing attention, because it potentially provides a pathway for wide variety of alcohols [1]. Short-chain alcohols such as ethanol are widely used in food, fuel, chemical, and other industries, while fatty alcohols are important raw materials that are used to synthesize plasticizers and surfactants [2]. Generally, the hydrogenation of short-chain esters, such as dimethyl oxalate [3–5], methyl acetate [6], and dimethyl adipate are performed in the vapor phase [7]. In a decentralized realization of that route, such an approach is energy consuming because of the vaporization and condensation of reactants and products, and the high H2/ester ratio requires substantial recycling of H2 [8]. Therefore, conceptually, liquid-phase conversion might be more economical and less energy intensive. For liquid ester hydrogenation, heterogeneous and homogeneous Ru-based catalysts are the most frequently reported [9–12]. Balaraman et al. [9] reported electron-rich, bipyridine-based Ru(Ⅱ) pincer complexes as catalysts for the hydrogenation of glycolide and lactide to 1,2-diols. Matteoli et al. [10] used Ru(CO)2(Ac)2(Pbu3) for hydrogenation of oxalates, reaching an ethylene glycol yield of 82%; however, overall heterogeneous catalysts appear to be more economical for this reaction [13]. Miyake et al. [12] studied Ru-Sn catalysts with different supports in liquid-phase hydrogenation of methyl laurate at 300 °C, reporting γ-Al2O3 to be the most suitable material studied. Sanchez et al. [14] described Ru-Sn-B/TiO2 to reach conversions above 90% at 290 °C in methyl oleate hydrogenation but only 25% alcohol selectivity. Overall, noble metal catalysts yield low alcohol selectivity. In contrast, Cu-based catalysts are excellent, because Cu is active for CO bond hydrogenation, but inactive for CC bond hydrogenolysis [15,16]. Thus, He et al. [17] reported a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst having an alcohol yield of more than 98% at 230 °C. The high selectivity was attributed to a combination of highly dispersed Cu° and Cu+ sites. Indeed, above 95% conversion and selectivity were achieved on Cu/ZnO catalysts for methyl laurate hydrogenation at 240 °C [18]. Wu et al. [19] described a Cu/SiO2 catalyst for hydrogenation of coconut oil via hydrogen transfer from methanol without added H2 (85% conversion at 240 °C with an alcohol selectivity of 100%). In the liquid-phase, sintering and/or leaching are the key problems for base metal catalysts [20,21]. O’Neill et al. [21] demonstrated a remarkable stability of Cu/γ-Al2O3 (prepared by atomic layer deposition) in liquid-phase hydrogenation as under-coordinated Cu atoms at edges, defects, and corners are covered by Al2O3. The stability of Cu-based catalysts, and their activity and for ester hydrogenation, has been found to be improved by doping with Pt, Ag, Au, B, and Zn [22–28]. In the latter case, synergetic effects between Cu and ZnOx have been attributed to (1) a morphologic effect (i.e., ZnO acts as a structural modifier to improve the Cu dispersion, (2) highly active sites created by modifying ZnO with Cu or oxygen vacancies or by the formation of a CuZn alloy, and (3) an atomic hydrogen reservoir located in ZnO particles [29]. According to previous reports, the dispersion of Cu species was the decisive factor of catalyst performance. Whereas, recent studies concluded that in methanol synthesis, the interfacial area between Cu and ZnO was a vital factor for the stability and activity of Cu/ZnO catalysts [26,29,30]. Metal-organic framework (MOFs) have been used as templates to synthesize metallic nanoparticles, as well as their oxide or sulfide equivalents [31–34]. For this catalyst we use Cu benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (Cu-BTC) a MOF with Cu nodes. During pyrolysis, Cu nodes are converted to metal nanoparticles, while the organic ligands form highly porous carbon [35]. In this way a catalyst consisting of a stable carbon support and highly dispersed metallic nanoparticles. In this work, we prepared a series of core-shell CuZnx@C catalysts by pyrolysis of Zn(NO3)2 loaded Cu-BTC. The Cu and Zn species were well distributed in the amorphous carbon after thermal treatment. The catalysts were characterized by thermogravimetry (TG), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The catalytic performance of CuZnx@C was tested in the hydrogenation of butyl butyrate to butanol as a model reaction, and the properties of active sites of Cu-based catalysts in liquid-phase hydrogenation of ester were well described."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99%) was obtained from Tianjin Yuanli Chemical Co. Ltd. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99%) was provided by Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Co. Ltd. N-butanol (99.5%), n-hexane (99.5%), and ethanol (99.7%) were provided by Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC 99%) was provided by J&K Chemical Co. Ltd. Lauric acid (98%), and butyl butyrate (99%) were purchased from TCI (Shanghai) Development Co. Ltd. N-propanol was purchased from Tianjin Concord Technology Co. Ltd."
3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis Cu-BTC was prepared through the method reported in reference [35] The method is briefly described as follows. Approximately 0.152 g BTC, 0.312 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and 4.75 g lauric acid were added into 76 mL n-butanol and stirred for 30 min until the solids were dissolved and a blue solution was obtained. The solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (200 mL) and heated under autogenous pressure at 140 °C for 4 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, the solid formed was separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol until the solution was colorless, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. CuZnx@C catalysts were synthesized by pyrolysis of the Cu-BTC precursors impregnated with Zn(NO3)2. For impregnation, a calculated amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 1 g Cu-BTC was added to 50 mL ethanol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Then, the remaining ethanol was removed by vacuum evaporation at 40 °C and the solid was dried at 50 °C overnight in a vacuum oven. The obtained materials were denoted as xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC, where x is the mass ratio of Zn to Cu. The CuZnx@C catalysts were obtained by thermal treatment of xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC in a tube furnace at 500 °C under N2. The Zn-to-Cu mass ratio was adjusted from 0 to 0.6 (Scheme 1 )."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization To obtain specific surface areas and pore size distributions, we performed N2 physisorption at 77 K with a Micromeritics Tristar II 3000 Analyzer instrument. The samples were pretreated at 100 °C for 1 h and at 300 °C for 3 h. Characterizations of Cu-BTC and xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC precursors were performed with a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 analyzer instrument after pretreating at 150 °C for 8 h. Actual Cu and Zn loadings were measured with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian Vista-MPX). Before measurements were taken, the Cu and Zn were added to mixtures of 5.5 mL HNO3 and 0.5 mL HCL and dissolved in the acid solutions by microwave digestion methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Data were obtained by scanning from 5° to 95° (2θ). To prevent changes in the sample, the materials obtained by pyrolysis in N2 were handled in tubes filled with Ar before measurement. The area of Cu was estimated with the following equation [36,37]: (1) S C u 0 = 6000 X C u / ( 8.96 × d h k l ) where XCu is the mass fraction of Cu and dhkl is the crystallite size of Cu. The optimum temperatures for the pyrolysis of catalyst precursors were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) on a NETZSCH STA449F3 instrument. Small amounts of catalyst precursors were loaded into an alumina container, and the analysis was conducted from 50 °C to 600 °C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images were performed with a Philips TECNAI G2 system electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun. The surface morphologies of catalysts were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a Hatachi 54800 field-emission microscope at 3.0 KV. Before examination, the powder samples were sprayed with gold for 60 s to guarantee its conductivity. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) were acquired with a PHI 1600 ESCA instrument (PE Company) equipped with an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray radiation source. The binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 285.0 eV as reference. The specific surface concentration of Cu+ (SCu(Ⅰ)) was determined by deconvoluting the XAES spectra. The basicity of the catalysts was characterized by CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) performed with a Micromeritics Autochem 2910. Approximately 0.1 g catalyst was pretreated at 200 °C with He followed by exposure to pure CO2 for 1 h. Then the sample was flushed with He to remove physically adsorbed molecules. The TPD was conducted from 50 °C to 600 °C under He. The desorption was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector."
5,Catalytic performance,"2.4 Catalytic performance A stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL) was used to evaluate the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts. Typically, 5 wt% butyl butyrate in n-hexane (24 g) and catalyst (0.3 g) were added to the autoclave, which was pressurized with H2 at 5.0 MPa and heated to 200 °C at a stirring rate of 800 rpm to eliminate diffusion limitations. At the end of the reaction time, the autoclave was cooled and the liquid was separated from the catalyst with a hydrophobic membrane. The products were identified and quantified using a gas chromatograph (Agilent Micro GC 4890) equipped with a Hewlett–Packard column (30 m V 0.32 mm V 0.50 m). n-Propanol was used as internal standard. The selectivity of n-butanol was 100% because no other product was detected. Therefore, the yield of n-butanol is defined as Eq. (2): (2) Y B u O H % = n B u O H 2 × n B u t y l b u t y r a t e The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as shown in Eqs. (3 and 4): (3) T O F C u ( 0 ) = Y B u O H × n B u t y l b u t y r a t e × 6.02 × 10 23 t × m c a t × S C u 0 × 1.46 × 10 19 (4) T O F C u ( I ) = Y B u O H × n B u t y l b u t y r a t e × 6.02 × 10 23 t × m c a t × S C u ( I ) × 1.46 × 10 19 where YBuOH is the butanol yield; nButyl butyrate is the initial amount of butyl butyrate; nBuOH is the amount of butanol in the final product mixture; t is the reaction time within which butyl butyrate conversion was less than 20%; mcat is the weight of the catalyst; and SCu(0) and SCu(I) are the surface areas of Cu+ and Cu°, respectively [15]."
6,Results,
7,Textural and morphological properties of Cu-BTC and xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC precursors,"3.1 Textural and morphological properties of Cu-BTC and xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC precursors The XRD patterns of Cu-BTC (Fig. 1 ) reflected the expected crystalline structure and show that the material was highly crystalline [38]. The patterns and cell parameters (Table 1 ) of all xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC catalyst precursors were similar to that of the parent material. This suggests homogenous distributions of Zn2+ in Cu-BTC, without distortion of the Cu-BTC framework. The octahedral structure of BTC was observed by SEM (Fig. 2 ), confirming that the octahedral structure was preserved during the impregnation process. The steep rise of N2 uptake at P/P0 = 0 to 0.02 in the sorption isotherms of xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC precursors (Fig. 3 (A)) reflects the microporous nature of the materials. The hysteresis loops at P/P0 = 0.9–1.0 for Cu-BTC and P/P0 = 0.5–1.0 for Zn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC indicate the presence of mesopores, albeit with low contribution to the total porosity as indicated by the small N2 uptake in this region. The specific surface area of Cu-BTC was 1466 m2/g and gradually decreased to 964 m2/g upon impregnation with increasing amounts of Zn(NO3)2. This decrease indicates that Zn species were deposited in the pores. This was also reflected in the changes of the pore size distributions. Fig. 3(left) shows that the proportion of the pore diameter at 1.1 nm (corresponding to the main channels) decreased with increasing loadings of Zn species and was negligible when the Zn/Cu ratio reached 0.6 [38]."
8,Textural and morphological properties of Cu@C and CuZnx@C,"3.2 Textural and morphological properties of Cu@C and CuZnx@C As shown in Fig. 4 , the TG trace of Cu-BTC treated in N2 features three main weight loss regimes. The weight loss from 40 °C to 120 °C and from 120 °C to 240 °C are attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed and structural water, respectively. The third steep loss from 280 °C to 365 °C with a weight loss of 32.8% is attributed to the decomposition of BTC. H2 and CO are produced in this process, which reduces CuO to Cu2O and Cu [32,39]. According to these results, the framework decomposition of xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC starts at 250 °C (i.e., lower temperature than for Cu-BTC [280 °C]). To ensure the total pyrolysis of BTC, all catalyst precursors were treated in N2 flow at 500 °C. The textural properties and composition of Cu@C and CuZnx@C catalysts are compiled in Table 2 . The actual and nominal loadings of Cu and Zn were identical. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions are shown in Fig. 5 (A) and (B), respectively. Most of the catalysts showed type IV isotherms with H4-type hysteresis loops, which indicates mesoporous structures. However, this mesoporosity decreases as the ZnO loading increases. The same observation was made for the specific surface areas, pore volumes and average pore size decrease (Table 2). The changes are hypothesized to be caused by partial occupancy of pores by ZnO. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Cu-BTC disappeared after thermal treatment (Fig. 6 ), which is in line with the expected loss of the primary structure of Cu-BTC. The XRD patterns of Cu@C showed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 43.2°, 50.4°, and 74.1°, which are assigned to the crystal planes (111), (200), and (220) of metallic copper (JCPDS No. 04-8436). The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.4°, 42.2°, and 61.4° are assigned to the crystal planes (111), (200), and (220) of Cu2O (JCPDS No. 78-2076). The XRD patterns of CuZnx@C catalysts show the characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnO (2θ = 32.0°, 34.6°, and 36.6°, JCPDS No. 36-1451). It is difficult to identify Cu2O particles in CuZnx@C, because of the overlap of the ZnO (101) and Cu2O (111) diffraction peaks, and the weak intensity of other signals of Cu2O. The crystal size of Cu crystals was calculated using the Scherrer formula based on the full width at half maximum of the Cu(111) diffraction peak., the CuZn0.3@C catalyst has the smallest Cu crystal size (Table 2), indicating that appropriate Zn (Zn/Cu = 0.3) doping could effectively prevent the agglomeration of Cu particles during pyrolysis. The lattice constant of Cu in CuZnx@C determined by XRD is identical to that of Cu@C, which indicates that Zn does not dissolve into the Cu particles to form a CuZn alloy [27]. Next, we used XPS and XAES to study the compositions and valence states of Cu and Zn species near the surface of Cu@C and CuZnx@C. The two peaks at 932.2 eV and 952.0 eV (Fig. 7 (A)) are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. [15,40,41] The absence of a Cu 2p peak at 942.0–944.0 eV indicates that most Cu2+ species had been reduced to Cu° or Cu+ during pyrolysis. The binding energy of the Zn 2p3/2 peak was located at 1021.9 eV (Fig. S2), which is in line with the presence of ZnO observed by XRD. eV) [42]. XAES was used to distinguish between Cu+ and Cu°, because their similar binding energies render XPS unsuitable for this analysis. As shown in Fig. 7(B), two symmetric peaks at 572.9 eV and 569.5 eV for Cu@C were assigned to Cu+ and Cu°, respectively. The carbon surface has many oxygenated groups and some of them can be retained after calcination and reduction. Cu+ is found to be formed in the reductive atmosphere of the pyrolysis process and is stabilized by the interaction between Cu and carbon via the oxygenated group on carbon surface (a species labeled as CuOC) [39]. Similar results were reported for Cu/SiO2 in our previous work, where Cu+ was stabilized by the interaction between Cu and Si (CuOSi) [15,40]. Compared with Cu@C, two new peaks centered at approximately 576.5 eV and 586.0 eV were found in the XAES spectra of CuZnx@C, which were in line with the standard spectra of Zn L3M23M45(3P) and Zn L3M23M45(1P), indicating the presence of ZnO [29,43]. Regarding Cu@C, the peaks at 569.4 eV and 572.6 eV correspond to Cu+ and Cu°, respectively. Cu+ in CuZnx@C could originate from the interaction between Cu and ZnO (Cu-O-Zn) [27,29] or carbon (CuOC). Deconvolution of XAES spectra (Table 3 ) suggests that the contribution of Cu+ first decreases with the introduction of ZnO into Cu@C but increases further with the ZnO loading. This supports the proposal that Cu+ species are created through Cu-O-Zn interactions in CuZnx@C. As shown in Fig. 8 , some Cu particles in Cu@C are encapsulated in carbon structures (shells), whereas some Cu particles are located outside the shells. The migration of Cu species to the outer surface of carbon during pyrolysis is hypothesized to be caused by the weak interaction between Cu and carbon. When a small amount of Zn was introduced (Zn/Cu molar ratio <0.6), the octahedral morphology of the Zn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC precursor was preserved after thermal treatment, and all Cu seems to be incorporated into the carbon shell. However, when the molar ratio of Zn/Cu reached 0.6, the original octahedral structure was transformed into smaller aggregated pieces (Fig. 2). TEM images of Cu@C (Fig. 9 (a), (b), and (c)) further illustrate that Cu nanoparticles (lattice spacing of 0.21 nm for Cu (111)) were wrapped by the carbon shell. Fig. 9(d) shows that Cu and ZnO particles also incorporate into the octahedral carbon shell. For instance, Fig. 9 (e) and (f) show the lattice fringes of Cu(111) and ZnO(102) domains to be in close proximity. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy images of CuZn0.3@C show uniform distributions of Cu and Zn in the carbon matrix (Fig. 10 )."
9,Catalytic performance of Cu@C and CuZnx@C,"3.3 Catalytic performance of Cu@C and CuZnx@C Butyl butyrate was used as the model reactant to test the hydrogenation activity of Cu@C and CuZnx@C. The results are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 11 (A). It is worth noting that the selectivity to butanol was 100%, because byproducts were not detected. Therefore, the reactant conversion is the same as the product yield. The space time yield (STY) of butanol was 0.05 mol/h/molCu on Cu@C, which is greatly improved by the addition of Zn. For example, the STY of butanol was 0.27 mol/h/molCu on CuZn0.3@C. We also investigated the stability of Cu@C and CuZn0.3@C catalysts. In selected experiments, the catalyst was washed with n-hexane at the end of the reaction and used again for ester hydrogenation in liquid-phase. Fig. 11 (B) shows that both Cu@C and CuZn0.3@C were stable under the conditions used for catalysis."
10,Hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters on CuZn0.3@C,"3.4 Hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters on CuZn0.3@C Methyl laurate and methyl caprylate were used as reactants to test the hydrogenation performance of CuZn0.3@C in a stainless-steel autoclave. As shown in Table 5 , high conversions of the methyl esters and selectivity to the corresponding aliphatic alcohols were achieved on CuZn0.3@C. However, byproducts generated from trans-esterification also were detected. Such byproducts are speculated to be caused by the presence of Brønsted acid or base sites on the catalyst. Therefore, a strategy to further suppress the side reaction and improve the selectivity to aliphatic alcohol deserves additional investigation."
11,Discussion,
12,Interaction between Cu species and ZnO or carbon,"4.1 Interaction between Cu species and ZnO or carbon Temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) is useful for characterizing the oxygen ions associated to various Cu species [36,44,45]. Fig. 12 shows CO2-TPD results of Cu@C and CuZnx@C catalysts. The two desorption peaks in the profile of Cu@C are attributed to weak (α peak) and moderately strong (β peak) basic sites. The weak basic site is attributed to OH groups(carbon hydroxyl) while moderately strong basic sites are associated with metal-oxygen pairs. The peak between 409℃ and 424℃ is assigned to the desorption of CO2 from Cu-O sites, while the peak at around 390℃ is attributed to desorption from Zn-O sites [44]. One additional CO2 desorption peak (γ peak) at higher temperature, assigned to strong basic sites, appeared with CuZnx@C. It is attributed to under-coordinated oxygen ions in Cu-O-Zn sites at interfaces between Cu and ZnOx (x = 0∼1) [25,44]. In line with this proposal, Table 6 shows that the proportion of strong basic sites (γ peak) increased as the ZnO loading increased. The formation of Cu-O-Zn sites seems to be associated with losses of Cu-O sites as seen from the decrease in the signal assigned to Cu-O, which decreases with increasing Zn loading. It has been reported that the interaction between ZnOx species and Cu+ species increases the Lewis acidity of the latter, which promotes methyl acetate hydrogenation [30]. According to the XAES results, the interaction between Cu and ZnOx in our materials is reflected by the binding energy of the Cu+ species in CuZnx@C (572.6 eV), which is lower than that of Cu@C (572.9 eV) (Fig. 7(B)). Hence, we conclude that Cu+ in Cu-O-Zn sites are electron deficient compared to those in CuOC bonds, which makes them more efficient to activate the carbonyl group of the acid moiety of the molecule."
13,The role of copper species on the liquid-phase ester hydrogenation,"4.2 The role of copper species on the liquid-phase ester hydrogenation The enhancing effects of ZnO on Cu-based catalysts for hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds has been studied by numerous groups. Zhang reported that Cu-ZnO interface sites (Cu0Zn) are the main active sites for CO bond hydrogenation, remarkably decreasing the apparent activation energy and improving the catalytic activity compared with pure Cu [27]. Our previous work demonstrated that the addition of ZnO to Cu catalysts leads to the formation of Cu-ZnOx species, being more active than Cu-O-Si species for the adsorption and activation of methyl acetate [26,29]. A synergetic interaction between Cu+ and Cu0 sites for gas-phase ester hydrogenation was proposed previously; that is, Cu0 facilitates H2 dissociation and Cu+ adsorbed methoxy and acyl species. Hypothesizing that similar interactions occurs in the liquid-phase study here, we calculated the turnover frequencies of both sites (TOFCu 0 and TOFCu +) based on the apparent surface area of Cu0 and Cu+ species. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the TOF values of CuZn0.15@C are higher than those of Cu@C, which renders higher catalytic activity even though Cu@C possesses the same Cu0 surface area and higher Cu+ surface area compared with CuZn0.15@C. This is attributed to the fact that Cu+ within Cu-O-Zn sites is more active than Cu+ in Cu-O-C sites. Fig. 13 shows that TOFCu + is independent of the surface area of the Cu0 species, implying that the amount of Cu0 species is not the determining factor for the reaction, i.e., the concentration of Cu0 sites is adequate for the activation of H2 at such reaction conditions [15]. Moreover, the excess of Cu0 does not affect the hydrogenation, especially when its surface area is higher than 6.8 m2/g. The linear correlation between the TOFCu 0 and Cu+ specific surface area indicates that Cu+ species is the key active site for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of esters on the studied catalysts. Provided that the catalyst has enough exposed Cu+, the H2 activation on Cu0 is concluded to be the rate-determining step. For the hydrogenation of ester, two steps are involved: hydrogenolysis of the ester to the aldehyde and the corresponding alcohol followed by hydrogenation of the aldehyde to the corresponding alcohol. Under our reaction conditions, the reaction rate for the second step is so rapid that the aldehyde was not detected. Therefore, hydrogenolysis of the ester is concluded to be the rate determining step. In a word, during hydrogenolysis of esters, Cu0 activates H2, while Cu+ adsorbs the carbonyl groups of esters. This synergy plays a key role on the reaction rates. Enhancing the adsorption of carbonyl groups on Cu+ sites by a Zn dopant can significantly improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst."
14,Roles of Cu-O-Zn and Cu-O-C species in ester hydrogenation,"4.3 Roles of Cu-O-Zn and Cu-O-C species in ester hydrogenation We carried out Density functional theory (DFT) calculations to disclose the roles of Cu-O-Zn and Cu-O-C species in ester hydrogenation (the computational details are described in the supplemental information). In the calculations, we used a ZnO(001) surface and an oxygen-containing defective graphene to model the two kinds of supports for Cu species. Methyl acetate (MA) was used as the reactant model to reduce computational cost. As shown in Fig. S1, the Cu+ species are more positively charged on the Cu-O-Zn (+0.34 e for each Cu+) surface than the Cu-O-C model (+0.28 e for each Cu+), which is consistent with the XAES results. We then thoroughly studied the adsorption of reactant, intermediates, and products involved in the hydrogenation of MA to ethanol on the Cu+ sites of each surface. The optimized adsorption structures, (Figs. S1 and S2a) show that the length of the CO bond adjacent to the carbonyl group of MA increases from 1.37 Å in the free form to 1.51 Å and 1.48 Å on the Cu-O-Zn and Cu-O-C substrates, respectively, pointing to easier MA dissociation to methoxy and acetyl species on Cu-O-Zn. The Cu-O-Zn surface also has more negative E ads values for all the species than the Cu-O-C surface, thus, suggesting that its better catalytic performance is caused by the strong interactions between the adsorbate and more positively charged Cu+ species. Furthermore, the calculated heats of reaction also indicate that the step-by-step hydrogenation of MA to ethanol is more exothermic on Cu-O-Zn than on Cu-O-C (Fig. S2b). Therefore, these calculations confirm that the Cu+ species are the key factor for the hydrogenation of the ester and that the Cu+ originating from the Cu-O-Zn sites have a much higher ability to dissociatively adsorb the ester than the Cu+ from Cu-O-C."
15,Conclusions,"We successfully synthesized MOF-derived CuZnx@C catalysts by direct pyrolysis of xZn(NO3)2/Cu-BTC precursors in N2 and tested it for hydrogenation of butyl butyrate in the liquid phase. The addition of ZnO improved the dispersion of Cu NPs owing to the strong interaction between Cu and ZnOx species. The catalytic activity of CuZn@C in liquid-phase ester hydrogenation resulted from the synergy effect of Cu0 and Cu+, with the latter sites being promoted when Cu and ZnO the interact. The linear correlation between TOFCu 0 and Cu+ specific surface area indicates that Cu+ originating from Cu-O-Zn is the key active site in butyl butyrate hydrogenation in the liquid-phase. DFT calculations confirmed that the Cu+ is the key active site for the adsorption and hydrogenation of ester to the corresponding alcohol. The authors declare no competing financial interest."
