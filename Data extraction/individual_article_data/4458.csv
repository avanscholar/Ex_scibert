0,Introduction,"As a fundamental electrochemical process, the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a critical role in many electrochemical devices, especially for overall water splitting to produce hydrogen, which has been considered as a clean and sustainable energy resource to potentially replace traditional fossil fuels in the future [1–5]. However, the inherently sluggish HER kinetics make it necessary to use electrocatalysts to improve the reaction efficiency, minimize the overpotential and satisfy the practical applications. Due to the lack of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts comparable to the expensive 20 wt% Pt/C, the large-scale application of overall water splitting to produce hydrogen is still overshadowed nowadays [6,7]. Intensive efforts have been devoted to design and develop noble-metal-free or less-noble-metal containing electrocatalyst with high HER catalytic activity. Although recent studies found that transition metal compound, such as phosphides [8–10], sulfides, selenides [11–13], and carbides [14–17] etc. [18,19] are all the most promising noble-metal-free candidates for HER, their electrocatalytic performance still cannot be compared with platinum. Therefore, the development of hybrid electrocatalysts combining the advantage of transition metal compound with less noble metal content may still be the best choice at present [20–24]. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), one of the two-dimensional layer-structured transition metal disulfides (TMD) with unsaturated sulfur atoms on the edges, is a promising catalyst for HER due to its rational hydrogen adsorption energy and cost-effectiveness [25–27]. Previous works proved that the active sites are mainly concerned with unsaturated sulfur atom located on the edge of the basal planes [28,29]. Up to data, various methods have been developed to expose the edge sites as many as possible to improve the HER efficiency, such as exfoliation into single or few layer, nano-crystallization the particle size, vertical-grafting on the subtracts, etc [30–34]. Besides, expanding the interlayer spacing of MoS2 is also believed an effective way to enhance the HER performance, which could significantly improve the H adsorption energetics on the catalyst and thus facilitate kinetics of the reaction [35–37]. Accordingly, it is more promising to synthesize nanostructured few-layer MoS2 with both high-density edges and expanded interlayer spacing. In addition, introduction of secondary noble metal into MoS2 could further improve the HER performance because of the preferable synergistic effect [38–41]. Loaded or grafted noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) could not only serve as additional HER catalytic active sites, facilitate electron transport, but also act as a barrier to prevent the intrinsically restacking or aggregating tendency of the layer-structured MoS2 due to the its much higher surface free energy and improve the HER catalytic stability. Combination of MoS2 with noble metal NPs is also a feasible approach to reduce Pt consumption and meanwhile ensure high HER catalytic activity for large scale application. Inspired by abovementioned studies, in this paper, we report the synthesis of ultrafine Pt-decorated interlayer-expended MoS2/N-doped carbon composite with sponge-like morphology through a one-pot pyrolysis protocol. PVP modified Pt nanoparticle was directly used as Pt precursor to avoid the aggregation and formation of large particles. The sponge-like N-doped carbon was generated as support to constructure a 3D catalyst networks. The synergy between Pt nanoparticle and few-layered interlayer expended MoS2 give rise to favorable intrinsic catalytic activity. Through these catalyst-design engineering efforts, the resulting composite showed much higher HER catalytic activities in acidic media with low overpotential (−20 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2), high exchange current density (6.24 mA cm−2) and much stable HER durability (more than 80 h). All these properties could be compared with that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This relative low-cost, and efficient cathode catalyst is suitable for mass production and practical applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials All the chemicals were all of analytical grade from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without any further purification. The PVP modified Pt colloidal were prepared according to the literature [42]. The methanol (180 ml), PVP (533 mg, Mw = 58, 000) and aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (6.0 mM, 20 ml) were mixed in a hermetic container (500 ml) and heated at 75 °C for 3 h. Then excess methanol and water were removed by rotary evaporation. The Pt NPs in the remaining solution were precipitated by adding acetone and then collected by centrifugation. Excess free PVP was cleaned with chloroform and hexane. Finally, PVP-modified Pt nanoparticles was dispersed in methanol to form a homogeneous colloidal."
3,Synthesis of Pt-MoS2/CN,"2.2 Synthesis of Pt-MoS2/CN Pt decorated ultrafine interlayer expended MoS2 anchored on N-doped carbon network with sponge-like morphology (Pt-MoS2/CN) was prepared through a one-pot pyrolysis strategy. 3 g melamine, 60 mg ammonium tetra-thiomolybdate and appropriate amount of PVP modified Pt colloid were mixed with 30 ml of N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF). After removing the solvent by rotary evaporator, the brown powder was pyrolyzed at 800 °C under an Ar/H2 (9:1) atmosphere for 2 h. The materials obtained with different Pt contents were named as Pt-MoS2/CN-0.5, Pt-MoS2/CN-1.1, Pt-MoS2/CN-3.2 and Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5, respectively (obtained by ICP-OES analysis). The compared sample without Pt (named as MoS2/CN) were prepared in the same way. The pure MoS2 was synthesized by directly pyrolyzed ammonium tetrathiomolybdate through the same heating procedure."
4,Material characterization,2.3 Material characterization Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained by a JSM-7001F field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100F electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) detector. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) were collected by Bruker D8 advance X-ray spectrometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) source operating at 40 kV. Raman analysis was performed on a Lab RAM HR800 spectrometer with 514.5 nm laser beam. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded by a VG Micro MK II system with an Al Kα X-ray source.
5,Electrochemical measurement,"2.4 Electrochemical measurement All the electrochemical performances were evaluated on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation. A standard three-electrode mode was consisted of an Ag/AgCl electrode, graphite rod and a glassy carbon electrode (decorated with a catalyst) as the reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. To prepare the working electrode, 4 mg catalyst, 2 ml isopropyl alcohol and 50 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%) were mixed under sonication for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then, 80 μL mixed ink was dropped on a glassy carbon electrode with 6 mm in diameter (mass loading: 0.552 mg cm−2) and dried naturally. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves were recorded within the frequency range from 0.01 to 1 × 105 Hz."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure and compositional characterization,"3.1 Structure and compositional characterization Pt decorated ultrafine interlayer-expended MoS2/N-doped carbon composite with sponge-like morphology (Pt–MoS2/CN) was prepared through a one-pot pyrolysis protocol. During preparation, PVP modified Pt-nanoparticle was directly used as precursor to prevent the formation of large aggregations. Meanwhile, ammonium tetra-thiomolybdate and melamine decomposed to form ultrafine MoS2 and 3D N-doped carbon networks, respectively. Interestingly, in this process, PVP not only acts as surfactant to prevent the aggregation of Pt, but also plays an important role in the pyrolysis to formation the interlayer-expanded MoS2 nanoparticles and sponge-like morphology, which can be proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. Pyrolysis of the mixture of ammonium tetra-thiomolybdate and melamine could only get a plate-like structure as showing in Fig. 1a. Further TEM analysis (Fig. 1d) indicates the plate are composed of flexible 2D layered N-doped carbon with some MoS2 nanoparticles confined on the surface, which also could be proved by the following XRD and XPS analysis. When PVP-modified Pt-NPs was added, the resulting 2D plate morphology turned to 3D sponge-like networks (Fig. 1b and c). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 1h) clearly indicate the uniformly dispersed C, N, Pt, Mo and S species. Besides, TEM analysis (Fig. 1e, f) clearly reveals that Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed within the carbon matrix and no aggregation could be observed. The particle size of Pt collected from over 30 different particles yielded an average value of 2.7±0.5 nm, matching well with that in the original PVP-modified Pt colloidal (2.6±0.3 nm) (Fig. S1). N2 adsorption-desorption experiments also indicate that the more PVP added the larger surface area could be gotten (Fig. S2). Using PVP modified Pt colloidal as precursor could not only prevent the formation of Pt large particles but also generate a porous structure for the resulting materials. In addition, the lattice spacing of 0.23 and 0.17 nm in the high resolution TEM image (Fig. 1g) are corresponding well with (103) and (106) planes of MoS2, respectively, indicating the formation of ultrafine MoS2 nanocrystalline within the porous carbon matrix. Therefore, the relative larger lattice spacing of 0.97 and 1.06 nm in Fig. 1f could be assigned as the interlayer spacing of the MoS2. It should be note that the interlayer space is obviously larger than that of bulk MoS2 (0.625 nm), which could significantly improve the H adsorption energetics on the catalyst and thus facilitate HER kinetics [27]. The formation of Pt decorated interlayer-expended MoS2/N-doped carbon composites could also be proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra analysis. Fig. 2a depicts the XRD patterns of the MoS2/CN and Pt-MoS2/CN composites. All the diffraction patterns exhibited a pronounced broad peak within 2θ range of 15–30°, which may be ascribed to the scattering of the amorphous carbon network. For MoS2/CN composite, the diffraction peaks are all broadened and in good agreement with that of 2H-MoS2 (JCPDS card no. 37-1492), indicating the formation of MoS2 nanocrystalline. When pyrolysis the mixture containing PVP-modified Pt colloidal, the resulting materials (Pt-MoS2/CN) show the similar diffraction patterns except that for (002). Comparatively, the (002) diffraction peaks for MoS2 in Pt-MoS2/CN composites all shifted to lower 2θ values, confirming the formation of interlayer-expended MoS2 nanocrystalline. These results consist well with above TEM analysis. Besides, due to the relative lower concentration and much close 2θ value with (103) diffraction peaks of MoS2, no obvious diffraction peaks of Pt could be observed even for that the loading content reached to 6.5 wt%. Fig. 2b shows the Raman spectra analysis of the composite MoS2/CN and Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5. The peaks at 1356 and 1595 cm−1 are attributed to the D and G bands of carbon network. The Raman shift located at 379.2 and 402.2 cm−1 could be assigned as E1 2 g and A1 g photon vibration modes. The frequency difference (∆k) of 23.0 cm−1 (smaller than 26.6 cm−1 of bulk MoS2) clearly demonstrates that most of the MoS2 nanocrystalline were composited of three layers within both of the composites [43]. The protonated pyridine nitrogen on the evenly distributed melamine interacts with thiomolybdate effectively inhibits the growth of MoS2 crystals along the c-axis, thereby forming few-layer MoS2 nanocrystalline [34,44]. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to investigate the surface chemical composition of the Pt decorated sample, the corresponding spectra for the MoS2/CN was also presented for comparison. The only difference for XPS survey is the Pt element. Fig. 3b depicts the C1s high resolution spectra, in addition to C–C and C–N bonds, C–O bonds also appeared in Pt-MoS2/CN composite, which may originate from the precursor of PVP-modified Pt colloidal. Both composites all contain graphitic N (400.3 eV) and pyridinic N (398.5 eV) within the high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s (Fig. 3c), confirming the successful N-doping of the carbon support [44,45]. The appearance of N–H band (401.6 eV) of Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 may be caused by PVP during the pyrolysis process [46]. The Pt 4f region for Pt-MoS2/CN composite shows four characteristic peaks from Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 orbitals at around 72.5 and 75.8 eV of Pt0 as well as 73.0 and 76.9 eV of Pt2+, although the binding energies of Pt0 show some positive shift compared with the standard, which may be caused by electrons changes under X-ray excitation [47]. Fig. 3e and f present the high-resolution XPS profiles within the Mo 3d and S 2p region. The characteristic peaks of Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 at 229.9 and 233.1 eV and those of S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at 162.8 and 164.0 eV clearly reveal the chemical composition of MoS2 within MoS2/CN structure. Comparatively, the binding energy of Mo 3d and S 2p have some negative shifts, and there are also exist lower-valence S-O bond (168.4 eV) and SO4 2- (169.7 eV) within Pt-MoS2/CN structure (Fig. 3f). According to TG analysis (Fig. S6a), the decomposition temperature of PVP is at about 400–460 °C, higher than that the formation of pyrolyzed MoS2 (230–360 ℃) [44]. The active S atoms of MoS2 nanocrystalline tend to react with oxygen formed PVP to generate the S–O bond, and thus form the interlayer expanded few-layer MoS2 [46]. Generally, the catalytic active sites of MoS2 are concerned with the exposure of Mo atoms [48]. The changes of the electronic states density of S may lead to intrinsic improvement of the Mo sites, which is beneficial for HER performance [49,50]."
8,Electrocatalytic HER performance,"3.2 Electrocatalytic HER performance HER performance was measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of these Pt decorated interlayer expended MoS2/N-doped carbon composites. The catalytic activity of the MoS2 and MoS2/CN were also investigated for comparison in the experiment. Obviously, MoS2 has the largest η10 overpotential (the overpotential of the current density at 10 mA cm−2). When confined within the porous N-doped carbon matrix, it has a greatly enhancement to −149 mV vs. RHE due to the formation of MoS2 nanoparticles and thus exposure more active site. Further introducing Pt nanoparticles led to substantial and gradual improvement in the HER activity. As shown in Fig. 4a, the η10 could significantly drop to only −20 mV vs. RHE when the platinum content reaches to 6.5 wt%, which is much better than most of the similar materials reported before (Table S1) and even better than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (−33 mV) (Fig. S7) [10]. Besides, the obvious onset overpotential shift from MoS2 to Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 also could be observed in the image, suggesting a possible change of catalytic active sites. Similar with that of η10, MoS2/CN composite exhibits a huge onset overpotential shift compared to bulk MoS2 due to the exposed more active sites. Interestingly, the onset overpotential present decrease first and then increase when PVP modified Pt colloidal was added, which may be concerned with the MoS2 content within the resulting composites (Table S2). The decomposition of ammonium tetra-thiomolybdate and melamine mixture could firstly generate MoS2/g-C3N4 and then get the MoS2/CN composite. Adding of PVP may greatly hinder the volatile of g-C3N4 at higher temperature and more carbon will be retained to form a 3D porous carbon network [51]. When Pt content large than 1.1 wt%, the active site provided by Pt NPs and interlayer-expanded MoS2 could compensate the decreased MoS2 content and further reduce the onset overpotential. The onset overpotential of Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 could dropped to 3 mV, which is also comparable to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (13 mV). The high HER catalytic activity of the Pt-MoS2/CN composite may attribute to the highly dispersed Pt NPs, interlayer-expanded MoS2 and 3D porous carbon network. Compared with normal MoS2, interlayer-expanded MoS2 process more active sites, which could significantly improve the H adsorption energetics on the catalyst. The co-existence of the Pt nanoparticles could not only serve as additional HER catalytic active sites, facilitate electron transport, but also act as a barrier to prevent the intrinsically restacking or aggregating tendency of the layer-structured MoS2 due to its much higher surface free energy. The synergy effect between Pt nanoparticle and few-layered interlayer expended MoS2 give rise to favorable intrinsic HER catalytic activity. Moreover, as an important parameter, Tafel slops were also performed in the experiment to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism of HER. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Tafel slop of pure MoS2 is 159.1 mV dec−1. When confined with the porous N-doped carbon matrix to form MoS2/CN composite, the Tafel slop decreases to 125.2 mV dec−1 due to the highly dispersed MoS2 nanoparticles. The more exposed active site and porous N-doped carbon structure could accelerate the speed of adsorption and diffusion during HER process. These Tafel values also indicate that hydrogen adsorption (Volmer reaction) is the rate-determining step for pure MoS2 and MoS2/CN composite. Interestingly, only incorporating a small amount of Pt within MoS2/CN structure, the Tafel slops could have a large decrease. The Tafel slop for Pt-MoS2/CN-0.5, 1.1, 3.2 and 6.5 are 110.4, 107.2, 106.9 and 104.2 mV dec−1, respectively. It is therefore revealed that HER over Pt-MoS2/CN composite proceeds through Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanisms and hydrogen desorption is the rate limiting step. The strong H+ ions adsorption capacity of platinum and interlayer-expended MoS2 nanocrystalline may be responsible for this phenomenon. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were used to further reveal the electrode kinetics. The equivalent series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) were calculated via the equivalent circuit model as shown in Fig. 4c. Obviously, the semicircles for Pt-MoS2/CN composites are all smaller than that of MoS2/CN under the potential of 48 mV vs. RHE. The Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 own the smallest Rct under low potential, reflecting a small hindrance in the circuit and a fast charge transfer between the solid-liquid interface. The result is in good agreement with the HER performance as shown in Fig. 4a. In addition to excellent HER activity, the Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 composite also exhibits good long-term durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. As shown in Fig. 4d, there is no obvious change for the LSV polarization curves before and after 1000 cycles. Significantly, it exhibits a continuous HER process over 80 h at an overpotential of 125 mV, and the current density of 10 mA cm−2 only display a slight degradation. The morphology and composition of the catalyst after the long-term operation as shown in Fig. S9. It clearly reveals the excellent catalytic activity and structural stability of the Pt-MoS2/CN composite. The interlayer-expanded MoS2 and Pt nanoparticles could be well wrapped by N-doped carbon network from aggregation and corrosion during the long-term reaction, and thus has a promising potential to substitute commercial Pt/C catalyst for HER. Generally, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is proportional to the effective electrode surface area, and thus was used to reveal the high activity of the Pt-MoS2/CN composite. The Cdl were calculated based on the cyclic voltammograms (CV) performance under different scan rate in the range of 0.1–0.2 V (Fig. S8). As shown in Fig. 4e, the Cdl of Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 is about 14.3 mF cm−2, much larger than that of MoS2/CN (7.2 mF cm−2), which means that the former has a relative larger effective active surface area. It is one of the main reasons for superior electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the exchange current densities of the composites were also calculated through fitting the Tafel plots at η = 0 V, as shown in Fig. 4f. The Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 composite not only shows the highest value (6.24 mA cm−2) for all the composites, but also larger than most of the similar materials reported before during HER processes (Table S1), indicating the potentially high hydrogen production efficiency."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, Pt-decorated ultrafine interlayer-expanded MoS2/N-doped carbon composite (Pt-MoS2/CN) was synthesized through a one-pot pyrolysis protocol. Using PVP modified Pt colloidal as precursor could not only avoid the formation of large Pt particles, but also play an important role in the formation of highly dispersed interlayer-expanded MoS2 nanocrystalline within N-doped carbon network. The electrochemical performance revealed Pt-MoS2/CN-6.5 has excellent HER properties in an acidic electrolyte with an overpotential of − 20 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and high exchange current density of 6.24 mA cm−2. The material also exhibits good durability over 80 h at an overpotential of 125 mV. The excellent HER performance, easy preparation together with the low cost makes it a promising cathode catalyst candidate for practical application."
