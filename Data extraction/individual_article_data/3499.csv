0,Introduction,"Dark fermentative H2-producing processes require less energy than physical/chemical processes, and have higher rates of H2 evolution in the absence of light and a greater versatility of substrates compared to biological photosynthetic processes [1]. Research on dark fermentative H2 production has been conducted in a variety of reactor systems. The continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is the most common operational mode and has been widely studied to continuously produce H2 from various substrates such as glucose, molasses, starch and cellulose [2–5]. In a conventional CSTR system, the solids retention time (SRT) is the same as the hydraulic retention time (HRT). This may limit the biomass concentration in the mixed liquor and therefore limit the substrate utilization and H2 production rates. In contrast, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) effectively decouples SRT from HRT and has been applied to anaerobic processes [3,6]. Studies examining MBRs for fermentative H2 production are still limited, however. Li and Fang [7] reviewed three reported cases of MBR processes for fermentative H2 production and indicated that generally the MBR mode did not show many advantages over the CSTR mode with respect to H2 production. This does not necessarily mean that MBRs are not suitable for fermentative H2 production, however, because other factors such as substrate utilization and system reliability in response to a variation of loading rates should be considered and investigated as well. Organic loading rate (OLR=influent substrate concentration/HRT) can influence H2 production in fermentative H2-producing CSTR systems but there is controversy in the literature as to whether higher H2 yields can be achieved with lower or higher OLRs [8]. A study of H2 production from a granular sludge-based CSTR at OLRs from 64 and 512g CODL−1 d−1 [9] indicated that a maximum H2 yield of 1.84mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 was achievable at an OLR of 512g CODL−1 d−1. This corresponded to an HRT of 0.5h and an influent glucose concentration of 10gL−1. In contrast, fermentative H2 production from waste sugar [10] showed that the highest H2 yields were found at an optimum HRT of 14–15h with a constant substrate concentration. There is limited information about the effect of OLR on the performance of a H2-producing membrane bioreactor (HPMBR) system. Oh et al. [11] observed that in their HPMBR system with an influent glucose concentration of 10gL−1 and SRT of 12h, the HRT could be reduced to 3.3h, increasing the glucose utilization from 90% in the CSTR mode to 98%, and increasing the H2 production rate (HPR) by 28% as well. Lee et al. [12] reported that with a substrate concentration of 20g CODL−1, further shortening the HRT to 1h provided stable volumetric HPRs of 1.48, 2.07 and 2.75Lh−1 (L-liquid)−1 for glucose, sucrose, and fructose, respectively. Both studies showed that with an HRT lower than 4h, the HPR was higher in the MBR mode than in the CSTR mode but this is due in part to the greater OLR possible at a lower HRT. What is not known is whether MBRs are superior to CSTRs with respect to H2 production at equal OLRs, because OLR also depends on the substrate concentration. To test this, H2 production from both operational modes must be compared at different substrate concentrations. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between OLR (and substrate concentration) and H2 production in the CSTR and MBR modes, and to determine if the MBR mode can enhance H2 production at high OLRs. This was done by evaluating the performance of a lab-scale fermentative H2-producing bioreactor run in the conventional CSTR mode and the MBR mode at different substrate concentrations."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reactor set-up,"2.1 Reactor set-up The continuous H2-producing bioreactor system is shown in Fig. 1 . The bioreactor had a volume of 7L of which 4L was liquid. The reactor was operated at 23±1°C and the pH was maintained at a value of 5.5±0.1 by automatic titration using 6M sodium hydroxide. In the MBR mode, a hollow-fiber ultrafiltration membrane module (ZW-1, GE Water and Process Technologies, Oakville, ON, Canada) was installed into the reactor. The flow rates of the feed, waste and permeate were controlled using digital-control peristaltic pumps (Cole-Parmer, Montreal, QC, Canada) to ensure an HRT of 8h in both operational modes and an SRT of 24h in the MBR mode. Most studies of fermentative H2 production from glucose have an HRT and SRT lower than 30h in the CSTR mode [7]. Mixing was provided by recirculation of the reactor contents with a peristaltic pump. Nitrogen gas (99.999% pure, Praxair, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was sparged into the reactor at a rate of 200mLmin−1 using two fritted-cylinder gas dispersion tubes with 40–60μm pore size (Corning Inc., Horseheads, NY, USA) in the CSTR mode to help mix the liquid and reduce the H2 consumption rate [13]; and directly into the membrane module at the same rate for gas scouring of the membrane surface in the MBR mode. The off-gas from the reactor passed through a 2L foam trap and a differential pressure flow meter (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Montreal, QC, Canada) to measure the gas flow rate. A digital pressure sensor (Sigma, Toronto, ON, Canada) was placed before the permeate pump to monitor the trans-membrane pressure."
3,Reactor start-up and operation,"2.2 Reactor start-up and operation To start-up the bioreactor, the empty reactor was purged with pure nitrogen gas for 30min and then 2L of screened anaerobic digester sludge (North Toronto treatment plant, Toronto, ON, Canada) and 2L of feed solution were added. The feed solution was prepared according to Kraemer and Bagley [14] to have a scaled-down glucose concentration of 1.3g CODL−1. The system was kept in the batch mode with only the recirculation pump working for 24h after which the reactor was changed to the CSTR mode with an HRT of 8h. After 3 days of operation, the mixed liquor was decanted and temporarily stored in another glass bottle with N2 sparging while the reactor was washed to remove sludge solids attached on the reactor's wall. Then the mixed liquor was transferred back into the reactor with continuous N2 sparging and the CSTR operation was resumed. Five experimental runs were carried out corresponding to OLRs of 4.0, 6.0, 13, 22 and 30g CODL−1 d−1, which were equivalent to influent glucose concentrations of 1.3, 2.0, 4.3, 7.3 and 10g CODL−1, respectively. The experimental sequence examined was in the OLR order of 4.0, 13, 6.0, 30 and 22g CODL−1 d−1. The amount of inorganic nutrients was proportional to the glucose input concentration (e.g., if the glucose input concentration was doubled, the nutrient concentration also doubled). Specifically, when the influent glucose concentration was 10g CODL−1, the nutrient solution entering the reactor contained (mgL−1): NH4Cl 500, KH2PO4 2000, FeCl2·4H2O 100, MgSO4·7H2O 100, MgCl2·2H2O 25.5, CaCl2·2H2O 25, NiCl2·6H2O 10, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O 7.1, ZnCl2 5.0, CuCl2·2H2O 2.5, MnCl2·4H2O 2.5, CoCl2·6H2O 2.5, KI 2.5, H3BO3 0.5, Na2WO4·2H2O 0.2, AlCl3·6H2O 0.1, Na2SeO3 0.1, NH4VO3 0.1. In each run, the reactor was operated in the CSTR mode for one week and then the membrane module was installed and the reactor was operated in the MBR mode for at least another week. After each run was completed, the reactor was cleaned and then returned to the CSTR mode. The influent concentration was adjusted to meet the OLR for the next run."
4,Analytical measurements,"2.3 Analytical measurements Headspace gases were measured by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector according to Kraemer and Bagley [15]. Standard methods [16] were used to measure total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the bioreactor. A GF/B glass fiber filter (Whatman, Canada) with a nominal pore size of 1.0μm was used instead of a 934-AH type with a nominal pore size of 1.5μm to provide better biomass capture (microscopic observation of the mixed liquor showed numerous single cells). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured according to Standard methods [16] as well. Four types of COD measurements were conducted. Influent COD measured the COD in the influent (the sampling location was after the glucose and nutrient solution mixing point). Total COD (TCOD) measured the COD of the mixed liquor in the bioreactor. Permeate COD measured the COD in the permeate in the MBR mode. Soluble COD (SCOD) measured the filtrate from the mixed liquor centrate. The mixed liquor samples were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 15min at 4°C and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45μm membrane filter (GHP Acrodisc GF, Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Residual glucose in the bioreactor and glucose in the permeate were analyzed enzymatically. Twenty microliters of the sample taken from the filtrate sample for SCOD measurement and 3mL glucose hexokinase (Thermo Electron Corp., Rockford, IL, USA) were mixed and vortexed for 1s and incubated at 37°C for 5min. The absorbance was measured at 340nm. Acetone, alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol), and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, i-butyric, n-butyric, i-valeric, n-valeric) were measured by headspace gas chromatography following the method of Kraemer and Bagley [13]. The samples were collected beginning from the 3rd day in each operational mode for at least 3 consecutive days. The steady-state value of a given parameter was taken as the average of the consecutive measurements for that parameter when the deviations among the measurement values were less than 5% in all cases. A t-test was used to determine significance at the 0.05 level using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Bioreactor performance,"3.1 Bioreactor performance Glucose conversion and soluble metabolite production in the CSTR and MBR modes are summarized in Table 1 for OLRs in the range of 4.0–30g CODL−1 d−1. Glucose was completely converted at OLRs from 4 to 13g CODL−1 d−1 in both operating modes. When the OLR was 22g CODL−1 d−1, only 60% of the glucose was converted in the CSTR mode but more than 98% was converted in the MBR mode. However, when the OLR was 30g CODL−1 d−1, glucose was partially utilized in both modes, with 66% conversion in the CSTR mode and 70% conversion in the MBR mode. The produced soluble metabolites included volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols. Butyric acid (HBu) and acetic acid (HAc) were the major soluble metabolites, together accounting for 78–97% of the total soluble metabolite COD, while alcohols and propionate contributed only 3–12%. Lee et al. [12] reported similar results in their study of H2 production in an MBR system. Consistent with other studies [12,17], the butyrate type fermentation predominated in the studied bioreactor. For the same OLR, the biomass concentration (gVSSL−1) was significantly higher in the MBR mode than in the CSTR mode (Fig. 2 ). This is mainly because the SRT in the MBR mode was three times that in the CSTR mode. In the CSTR mode, when the OLR increased from 4.0 to 13g CODL−1 d−1, biomass concentration increased; but when OLR further increased from 13 to 30g CODL−1 d−1, the biomass concentration did not increase significantly (95% confidence). In the MBR mode, the biomass concentration similarly increased when the OLR increased from 4.0 to 13g CODL−1 d−1, and increased further when the OLR increased from 13 to 22g CODL−1 d−1, but then did not significantly increase as the OLR increased from 22 to 30g CODL−1 d−1. The COD recovery, measured as the ratio of total COD leaving the reactor in all forms to the total influent COD, was 94–100% in the CSTR mode and 82–96% in the MBR mode (Table 2 ), not including COD associated with the solids deposited on the membrane surface. The high COD recoveries indicate that the reactor was at steady state when sampling and suggest that the average values of the measured parameters reliably represented the system steady-state performance."
7,Glucose conversion and hydrogen production,"3.2 Glucose conversion and hydrogen production The glucose conversion rate (GCR), calculated as (influent flow rate×influent glucose concentration−effluent flow rate×effluent glucose concentration)/mixed liquid volume, varied with OLR (Fig. 3 ). Because glucose was completely consumed at an OLR of 4, 6 and 13g CODL−1 d−1, the GCR was the same in both modes and increased linearly with OLR increases. When the OLR increased from 13 to 22g CODL−1 d−1, the GCR did not increase significantly in the CSTR mode but did increase in the MBR mode. In contrast, when the OLR was further increased from 22 to 30g CODL−1 d−1, the GCR significantly increased in the CSTR mode but slightly decreased in the MBR mode (the difference was not statistically significant). The GCR was not significantly different between the CSTR and MBR modes except at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1. Hydrogen production is perhaps the key criterion to evaluate the performance of fermentative hydrogen-producing bioreactor processes. The biogas produced consisted of H2 and CO2 with H2 consistently at headspace concentrations of 52–57% in both modes. The hydrogen production rate (HPR), calculated as moles of hydrogen produced per day/reactor liquid volume, is shown in Fig. 3 as well. For OLRs between 4.0 and 13g CODL−1 d−1, the HPR increased linearly with increasing OLR in both modes, showing a similar increasing trend as the GCR. At an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1, the HPR was higher than at the OLR of 13g CODL−1 d−1 in both modes. Furthermore, the HPR was 0.20molL−1 d−1 in the MBR mode, more than 50% higher than in the CSTR mode (0.13molL−1 d−1). When the OLR increased to 30g CODL−1 d−1, the HPR increased linearly to 0.19molL−1 d−1 in the CSTR mode but significantly decreased to 0.16molL−1 d−1 in the MBR mode. Overall, the HPR was significantly lower in the MBR mode than in the CSTR mode at all OLRs examined except 22g CODL−1 d−1. H2 yield, calculated as moles of hydrogen produced per mole of glucose converted, is widely applied to evaluate hydrogen productivity among different H2-producing bioreactor systems. In this study, the H2 yield ranged from 0.94 to 1.80mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 (Fig. 4 ). When the OLRs were between 4 and 13g CODL−1 d−1, the H2 yields averaged 1.25mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 in the CSTR mode (no significant difference with OLR) and 0.97mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 in the MBR mode (no significant difference with OLR). However, when the OLR was 22g CODL−1 d−1, the highest H2 yields of 1.80mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 in the CSTR mode and 1.77mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 in the MBR mode were observed and the two yields were not significantly different. At an OLR of 30g CODL−1 d−1, the H2 yield was not significantly different from that at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1 in the CSTR reactor but decreased significantly in the MBR reactor, although still remaining above the H2 yield observed at OLRs less than or equal to 13g CODL−1 d−1. In summary, there appeared to be a distinctive breakpoint between the H2 yields at OLRs of 13g CODL−1 d−1 or lower and those at OLRs of 22g CODL−1 d−1 and higher. The H2 yields at the higher OLRs were significantly greater than those at the lower OLRs. Higher yields have also been observed at higher OLRs in other studies [19–21]. Lin et al. [20] reported H2 yields of 2.17mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 at an OLR of 160g CODL−1 d−1 compared to 1.34mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 at an OLR of 20g CODL−1 d−1."
8,Factors affecting H2 yields at different OLRs,"3.3 Factors affecting H2 yields at different OLRs The H2 yields measured in the current study showed no relationship to OLR when the OLRs were below 13g CODL−1 d−1, for either CSTR or MBR systems, but then appeared to be maximized at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1 in both systems, decreasing as the OLR was increased further above that. Possible reasons for this non-linear relationship between H2 yield and OLR may be found by examining the glucose conversion and hydrogen production rates (GCR and HPR). The H2 yield is equal to the ratio of the HPR to the GCR. As seen in Fig. 3, both HPR and GCR were linear for both the CSTR and MBR modes when the OLR was less than or equal to 13g CODL−1 d−1. This also corresponds to the OLRs where all entering glucose was consumed (Table 1). The H2 yield increase at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1 occurred when all the entering glucose could no longer be consumed in either operating mode. In the CSTR mode, the HPR increased linearly throughout the OLR range examined with the H2 yield increase at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1 due to an abrupt decrease in the GCR. In the MBR mode, ignoring the HPR at an OLR equal to 22g CODL−1 d−1, the increased H2 yield at an OLR equal to 30g CODL−1 d−1 versus lower OLRs is due to the same phenomenon: HPR was linearly related to OLR but the GCR decreased. The MBR performance at an OLR equal to 22g CODL−1 d−1 was significantly different, however: the GCR remained linearly related to the OLR and the HPR significantly increased. At that OLR, the MBR mode significantly outperformed the CSTR mode with respect to glucose consumption and was only slightly overloaded (90–100% glucose conversion, Table 1) while at the highest OLR, both operating modes were significantly overloaded with respect to glucose conversion (glucose conversion less than 90%). One hypothesis to explain these results is that the GCR became limited once the system was overloaded with respect to glucose conversion, while the HPR continued to increase as the OLR increased. This was observed for the CSTR mode at OLRs equal to 22 and 30 CODL−1 d−1. Additionally, it is possible that when the system was slightly overloaded (90–100% glucose conversion), there was a fundamental change in the HPR to OLR relationship, resulting in an enhanced HPR as was observed for the MBR mode at an OLR equal to 22g CODL−1 d−1. If valid, these hypotheses suggest that there may be an optimum OLR for hydrogen production and that optimum may be near the OLR that causes overloading with respect to glucose conversion. Additional experimentation is required, with tests both above and below the overloading OLRs, to test these hypotheses. Additional studies are also needed to identify the specific metabolic responses that are occurring at or near the overloading OLR. The results of the current study contrast with the results of Van Ginkel and Logan [18] who observed that the H2 yield decreased with increasing OLR over the OLR range of 6–24g CODL−1 d−1 in a CSTR with an HRT of 10h. Van Ginkel and Logan hypothesized that the decreased H2 yield was due to inhibition of H2 production caused by H2 supersaturation in the liquid phase. Oh et al. [22] also observed homoacetogenesis in batch H2 production systems and postulated that this could decrease H2 yield. In the current study, neither of these reasons for the decreased H2 yield was likely valid, hence the differing results. Kraemer and Bagley [8] identified that dissolved H2 concentrations could not be decreased sufficiently to affect thermodynamic regulation and increase H2 yield. Subsequently, Kraemer and Bagley [23] determined that an optimum N2 sparging rate of 12mLmin−1 L-liquid−1 maximized H2 yield and further increasing the sparging rate did not increase H2 yield in a continuous-flow H2-producing bioreactor at an OLR of 32g CODL−1 d−1. In the current study, the sparging rate was 50mLmin−1 L-liquid−1 in both modes, high enough to ensure no limitations due to dissolved H2 concentration. Additionally, although H2 consumption, presumably from homoacetogenesis, has been detected in a continuous-flow system [13], the relative impact in an actively sparged system was low. Furthermore, if H2 consumption were a factor, it apparently decreased as OLR increased in the current study. The results of this study do not preclude a decrease in H2 yield at even higher OLRs than those tested. Van Ginkel and Logan [24] observed the initiation of solventogenesis with a concurrent yield decrease from 2.0mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 at OLRs of 26–77g CODL−1 d−1 to 1.6mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 at an OLR of 102g CODL−1 d−1 and showed this was likely due to inhibition from the undissociated acids produced. A total self-produced (not externally added) undissociated acid concentration of 19mM was identified as a threshold concentration for significantly decreasing H2 yields. In the current study, the highest concentration of undissociated acids was 4.1mM at an OLR of 30g CODL−1 d−1, more than four times lower than the threshold concentration reported by Van Ginkel and Logan [24], suggesting that inhibition due to undissociated acids was minimal in the current study."
9,Comparing CSTR and MBR operation,"3.4 Comparing CSTR and MBR operation At OLRs that were low enough to allow complete substrate consumption, the CSTR performed better than the MBR with a significantly higher H2 yield. The CSTR operation will require downstream separation of suspended solids while the MBR operation provides a permeate that is essentially free of suspended solids. The value of this trade-off, suspended solids removal versus higher H2 yield, must be determined for each system of interest. At OLRs that clearly overloaded the reactor with respect to substrate removal, the CSTR performance was, somewhat surprisingly, essentially equal to that of the MBR. In this study, although the biomass concentration was almost three times higher in the MBR than in the CSTR at an OLR of 30g CODL−1 d−1, the GCRs were equal and the HPR was slightly better in the CSTR. Conceptually, because of their higher biomass concentrations, systems with longer SRTs should provide overall faster substrate removal rates but this was not observed in this study at overloaded OLRs. Additionally, systems with longer SRTs allow slower growing microorganisms to be retained. The benefit of this, however, depends on the role of the slower growing microorganisms. In methanogenic systems, aceticlastic methanogens and syntrophic organisms are rate limiting and require a long SRT to be retained in the system. In a H2-producing system, the fermentative organisms grow quickly on soluble substrate. The retention of slower growing microorganisms does not appear to provide a significant benefit in this case but may be more important if non-soluble substrates are used. The MBR mode did provide a distinct benefit over the CSTR mode when the OLR was near the overloaded level. In the MBR, the GCR continued to increase linearly as the OLR increased from 13 to 22g CODL−1 d−1, just becoming slightly overloaded (90–100% glucose conversion) at the high end of the OLR range. In the CSTR, however, the OLR became significantly overloaded (glucose conversion <90%) between 13 and 22g CODL−1 d−1. Because no OLRs were tested within this range in the CSTR mode, a clearer identification of the OLR at which the system became overloaded cannot be made. These results clearly indicate, though, that for H2-producing reactors operated close to their maximum OLR with respect to substrate overloading, the MBR mode should provide more robust operation. While the H2 yield was equal between the MBR and CSTR at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1, because substantially more glucose was consumed in the MBR, over 50% more H2 was produced in the MBR than in the CSTR at this OLR, 0.78 versus 0.51molesday−1 (Table 2). Note also that the H2 production for the MBR at an OLR of 22g CODL−1 d−1 was the highest of all the conditions examined, even those receiving a higher OLR."
10,Conclusions,"When the OLR was below that which overloaded the reactors with respect to glucose utilization (13g CODL−1 d−1 or less in this study), the HPR was linearly related to OLR, and H2 yield was independent of OLR with an average of 0.97mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 in the CSTR mode and 1.20mol H2 (mol Gluc. Conv.)−1 in the MBR mode. Additionally, at OLRs below those that caused overloading, the CSTR operation provided a higher H2 yield than the MBR. When operating at these underloaded OLRs, the CSTR mode would likely be preferred unless the suspended solids separation capability of the MBR mode is needed. Similarly, when the OLR is above that which overloads the reactors with respect to glucose consumption (>22g CODL−1 d−1 in this study), the CSTR mode would likely be preferred for the same reasons. At the OLR close to that which caused overloading (22g CODL−1 d−1 in this study), the H2 yield increased significantly for both CSTR and MBR modes, suggesting that an OLR may exist that optimizes H2 yield and that OLR may be near the OLR that causes overloading with respect to substrate utilization. Furthermore, at this OLR, the MBR mode performed significantly better than the CSTR mode with respect to glucose utilization and H2 production. If a system is designed to operate close to the OLR which causes overloading, the MBR mode should perform better than the CSTR."
