0,Introduction,"Increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a result of industrial revolution (IPCC, 2013) and anthropogenic activities, i.e. combustion of fossil fuels such as wood, coal, oil, and natural gas, etc. (Bajracharya et al., 2017a; Leung et al., 2014), has necessitated the need to find alternative energy sources like, solar, wind, biomass, etc. Also, the need of the hour is to increase the energy supply to meet the escalating demand as well as to reduce the CO2 foot prints (Srikanth et al., 2016a,b). In the course of searching for such alternatives, researchers have found different ways of linking CO2 loads and alternative energy pools to produce industrially relevant chemicals or fuels. In recent years, various approaches for capturing and transforming CO2 to value-added chemicals were developed among which microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is one of the vibrant technologies that can utilize the renewable energy from solar or wind to transform CO2 into value-added products (Jourdin et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2013a). The combined action of microbial and electrochemical redox reactions that can reduce the thermodynamic energy required to transform CO2 into products forms the basis of this technology (Zaybak et al., 2013). Microbes that are capable of exchanging electrons with solid electron acceptors and have ability to accommodate CO2 into their metabolic pathways will catalyze this reaction (Lewis and Nocera, 2006; Lovley and Nevin, 2013; Nevin et al., 2011; Rabaey et al., 2011; Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010). After first inception of the MES in 2010 (Nevin et al., 2010), several studies have reported CO2 transformation at lab scale using pure (Giddings et al., 2015; Nevin et al., 2010, 2011; Zhang et al., 2013) and mixed cultures (Annie Modestra et al., 2015; Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2016; Jourdin et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2013b; Mohanakrishna et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2015a; Su et al., 2013; Tremblay and Zhang, 2015). Various studies reported till date on this concept (Marshall et al., 2013b, 2012; Steinbusch et al., 2010) have shown the possibility of producing acetate at higher titers and limited studies have reported up to C4 organics in significantly low titers (Bajracharya et al., 2017b, 2016; Arends et al., 2017; Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2017; Ganigue et al., 2015). Solubility of the CO2 and its availability to biocatalyst was listed as one of the limitations (Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2017; Mohanakrishna et al., 2016), along with the selection of microbes that can uptake the electrons and initiate C-assimilation to fine-tune the product slate and titers (Annie Modestra et al., 2015; Mohanakrishna et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2015a). MES researchers across the globe are in search for effective methods to dissolve CO2 and increase the contact time with biocatalyst and decrease the mass transfer issues related to CO2. Application of GDE is one such approach where the CO2 solubility can be substantially increased and the respective product formation also can be increased (Bajracharya et al., 2016). Bajracharya and co-workers reported first work on the application of GDE in MES, which increased the acetate production up to 2.1 times compared to the submerged electrodes (Bajracharya et al., 2017b). Similarly, application of 3D electrode also increased the contact time of CO2 to biocatalyst and resulted in enhanced acetate production (Jourdin et al., 2015). However, the major product considered in both these studies was acetate. Increasing the carbon chain length and producing alcohols, instead of lower chain organic acids will help the technology to see the commercial platform as the alcohols like ethanol and butanol can be used as drop-in fuels without modifying the existing transport infrastructure. On the other hand, the biocatalyst metabolic efficiencies also dictate the CO2 transformation ability and product slate. Major literature reported the use of autotrophic microbes like, Clostridium ljungdahlii, Moorella thermoacetica, Sporomusa ovata, etc., or selectively enriched homoacetogenic mixed cultures for CO2 transformation (Annie Modestra et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2012; Mohanakrishna et al., 2015; Nevin et al., 2010; Patil et al., 2015a). However, acetate was observed as foremost product of all these studies and other products reported are in significantly lower titers. Henceforth, there is a need of developing selective culture that has capability to produce higher organics. In this context, an attempt was made to study the application of GDE for the CO2 transformation to alcohols using selectively enriched mixed culture having ability to produce higher organics in a specially designed cell under -1 V of applied potential against Ag/AgCl reference electrode."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biocatalyst,"2.1 Biocatalyst An adaptive and forced laboratory evolution approach (selective enrichment) was used to enrich and isolate high performing biocatalyst from corroded metal piece. Briefly, the mixed culture obtained from corroded metal surface was initially enriched in mixotrophic media (glucose, 5 g/l, NaHCO3 – 1.2 g C-eq/day, HCOOH – 1.5 g/l, NH4Cl – 0.5 g/l, MgSO4 – 0.3 g/l, CoCl2 – 25 mg/l, ZnSO4 – 11.5 mg/l, CuSO4 – 10.5 mg/l, CaSO4 – 5 mg/l, MnSO4 – 15 mg/l; NiSO4 – 16 mg/l; FeSO4 – 25 mg/l) under CO2 partial pressure. After 3 repeated cycles of enrichment, the glucose concentration was reduced along with increasing bicarbonate concentration in 5 levels each followed by 3 consecutive cycles. Finally, the media was deployed of glucose and the culture enriched autotrophically using bicarbonate as sole C-source. The selectively enriched culture was pelleted out into phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) and inoculated into the Working Electrode chamber."
3,Reactor construction,"2.2 Reactor construction The reactor used in this study is similar to the one mentioned by Bajracharya et al. (2016), varying the material of construction, electrode arrangement and volumes. Dual chamber MES reactor was assembled using three circular cylindrical Perspex rings (5 cm diameter and 1.5 cm height) each of which forms about 29.45 ml chamber. Two Perspex circular plates without cylindrical hole in centre were used as end plates. The front two rings after end plate were considered as counter electrode and working electrode chambers respectively, separated by proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117), while the third ring was used as gas chamber. VITO-Core® GDE (projected surface area of ∼40 cm2) was used as working electrode in this study and placed between the working electrode and gas compartments with gas diffusion layer made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) facing the gas compartment and activated carbon layer facing the electrolyte side of working electrode chamber. Activated carbon cloth coupled to stainless steel mesh (projected surface area of ∼80 cm2) was used as counter electrode placed adjacent to membrane after working electrode compartment. Both the electrodes and stainless steel mesh were kept in PBS overnight. L-shape side port was fixed to the working electrode chamber to insert Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl, +201 mV vs SHE) reference electrode (ALS, Japan). Both the electrolytes for working electrode and counter electrode were placed in feed tanks of 2 L working volume (Schott-Duran bottles) having two channels at the lid for inlet and outlet and connected to the respective chambers."
4,Operation details,"2.3 Operation details PBS (pH 8.0) added with trace metal solution was used as electrolyte at working electrode, while PBS (pH 6.0) added with 0.5% NaCl was used as electrolyte at counter electrode. Experiment was carried out in batch recirculation mode, where both the electrolytes were recirculated using two peristaltic pumps from respective feed tanks at a rate of 30 ml/min. Both the feed tanks were closed properly without gaseous exchange and kept on magnetic stirrers at 300 rpm for proper mixing of the electrolyte. Initially, the electrolyte of working electrode was purged with nitrogen (N2) gas (99%) to maintain anaerobic condition and started recirculation. After one complete batch recirculation, the selectively enriched inoculum was added to the feed tank anaerobically. Simultaneously, the CO2 (99.99%) was fed to the gas compartment alongside of GDE at a rate of 15 ml/min. CO2 pressure in the gas chamber was maintained by keeping the CO2 outlet tube in water column (15 ml) to increase the CO2 diffusion through the gas diffusion layer of GDE. Experiments were carried out under anaerobic condition at ambient temperature (29 ± 2 °C). Experiments were carried out using potentiostat–galvanostat (Ivium, The Netherlands) system under constant potential mode by applying −1 V vs Ag/AgCl (−795 mV Vs SHE) to working electrode. All potentials mentioned in the manuscript are against Ag/AgCl reference electrode unless otherwise stated. Experiments were conducted as duplicate and the average of the results obtained were presented in the manuscript. Sampling was done every 5 days and after each sampling (5 ml), the volume of the feed tank was maintained by adding PBS (pH 8.0) with trace metal solution."
5,Analysis and calculations,"2.4 Analysis and calculations Current consumption based on the current density obtained from chronoamperometry (CA) at applied potential of −1 V and the product synthesis were considered to assess the performance of the reactor. The collected samples were analyzed for pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), Total organic/inorganic carbon (TOC/TIC), organic acids and alcohols. The pH and DO were monitored on daily basis, while the other analysis was done at every 5 days interval. TOC/TIC was analyzed using TOC analyzer (Multi N/C 2100S from M/s Analytic jena) and the product analysis was done using gas chromatography (GC). A Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 GC with flame ionization detector (FID) was used for the carbon number distribution of control and bio treated samples. A non-polar capillary metal column 100% dimethyl polysiloxane (60 m × 0.32 mm id × 0.25 µm film thickness) was used for the desired separation. The temperature programme was 35 °C (0.5 min) −10 °C to 450 °C (20 min) to achieve separation using injector temperature 350 °C and detector temperature 350 °C with 2.0 ml/min column flow (He). Head-space gas was analyzed on a Gas Chromatograph (NAT GAS-B analyzer) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TID) and 1.8 × 3.2 nm stainless-steel columns packed with molecular sieve 5A. Helium gas was used as carrier gas. All the calculations were done as described in literature as guidelines for MES (Patil et al., 2015b). Integrated coulombs consumption over time relative to the coulombs required to produce the exact quantity of each product formed was calculated as columbic efficiency (CE). Projected yield of the product were calculated based on the surface area of the electrode."
6,Results and discussion,Experiment was carried out continuously for 90 days without changing any of the operating conditions using selectively enriched biocatalyst. Current consumption and product profiles along with the change in pH and TIC levels were used to understand the experimental results and drawing the conclusions.
7,Product synthesis against current consumption,"3.1 Product synthesis against current consumption Higher current consumption (−13 ± 2.8 A/m2) was observed for 48 h, immediately after start-up of experiment with lot of fluctuations (Fig. 1 ). This higher current can be attributed to the catalytic current generated by the electrode due to the active functional groups on the carbon layer of GDE (Srikanth et al., 2016a,b). The current consumption gradually decreased with time and halted at −8 ± 1.2 A/m2 and continued for about 15 days with intermittent increment in current density. This is due to the adaptation of the biocatalyst to the reactor environment and their proliferation as biofilm on the carbon layer of GDE. During this phase, product synthesis was also observed as a result of microbial transformation of CO2. At the very first onset of product synthesis, CO2 is transformed to formic acid and acetic acid at a rate of 260 mg/l/day and 80 mg/l/day respectively on 5th day accounting for a total product of 1.7 g/l (Fig. 2 a). This was further increased to 360 mg/l/day and 106 mg/l/day of formic acid and acetic acids on 10th day of the experiment along with 21.6 mg/l/day of methanol accounting for 4.88 g/l of total product (Fig. 2b). Conversion of formic acid by formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase to methanol is one of the easiest pathways of reduction in microbial metabolism (Srikanth et al., 2017). About 5–9% of CE was attributed for formic acid synthesis in a total of 11–19% CE observed during first 10 days of experiment, which resulted in the formic acid synthesis at rate of 13–18 g/m2/day accounting for about 73–76% of total product (Fig. 3 ). Acetic acid was produced at a rate of 4–5 g/m2/day and occupied the remaining major fraction of 21–24% in the total product in these 10 days with about 5.5–8% CE. On day 15, a decrement in production of formic acid (191.33 mg/l/day) and acetic acid (92 mg/l/day) was observed coupled with increase in methanol concentration (30.87 mg/l/day) without change in total product concentration (4.71 g/l). This indicates the conversion of the formic and acetic acids to methanol consuming the redox equivalents under the applied potential. Further operation of experiment resulted in increased current consumption (−10 ± 0.88 A/m2) which remained more or less stable till 30th day. The product synthesis also increased with time and reached about 8.78 g/l by 30th day along with significant change in product slate. Methanol production decreased to 10.8 mg/l/day on 20th day along with drop in formic (134.5 mg/l/day) and acetic (84.5 mg/l/day) acids. After formic and acetic acids, methanol production was detected on 10th day at a rate of 1 g/m2/day (with 2.3% CE), which reduced to negligible production rates (0.1 g/m2/day with 0.25% CE) later with time. On the other hand, ethanol (30.65 mg/l/day) and butyric acid (43.65 mg/l/day) production was started at working electrode from day 20 onwards. Consumption of redox equivalents for reduction of acetic acid to ethanol and chain elongation to butyric acid under applied potentials and CO2 environment resulted in shifting the metabolic pathways. Further operation of reactor increased the production of ethanol (54 mg/l/day), acetic acid (94.4 mg/l/day) and butyric acids (50.4 mg/l/day) coupled with drop in methanol (10.56 mg/l/day) and formic acid (117.2 mg/l/day) production. On day 35, the production of butanol (14.13 mg/l/day) was observed along with ethanol (64.57 mg/l/day) consuming the formic (86 mg/l/day), acetic (46.29 mg/l/day) and butyric (49.33 mg/l/day) acids as well as methanol (8.23 mg/l/day). Increased current consumption at this time interval supports the start-up of new reduction pathway for butanol synthesis. After 40th day, the current consumption decreased (−6.5 ± 2.2 A/m2) till 62nd day with fluctuations followed by regaining stability up to 76th day (−9 ± 0.65 A/m2). After 76th day, the average current density remained similar but with fluctuations till the end of operation. Noticeable change was observed in product profile between 40th and 65th day of operation in connection with the drop in current consumption. Increment in rate of ethanol production (68.5 mg/l/day on 40th day to 141.07 mg/l/day on 65th day) was observed, while the butanol production rate was consistent between 40th and 45th days (29.8 ± 0.8 mg/l/day) as well as 50 to 65 days (36.5 ± 0.87 mg/l/day). In the same way, gradual drop in acetic (44.25 mg/l/day on 40th day to 31.69 mg/l/day on 65th day) and formic acids (70.75 mg/l/day on 40th day to 48 mg/l/day on 65th day) production was observed while the butyric acid showed substantial increment in production rate day by day (47.75 mg/l/day on 40th day to 87.39 mg/l/day on 65th day). On the other hand, methanol production became negligible (∼4 mg/l/day) and continued to decrease till the end of operation. Consumption of acetic and butyric acids towards the formation of butyric acid and ethanol is evident from this. The consistency in butanol production rate is from the consumption of butyric acid along with its production from acetic acid. About 2.1 times increment in the total product from 10.68 g/l on 40th day to 22.59 g/l on 65th day was observed. After 65th day, ethanol showed gradual increment from 168 mg/l/day on 70th day to 177.5 mg/l/day on 80th day followed by decrement on 90th day (168.89 mg/l/day). Similarly the butyric acid production rate was consistent till 90th day (89.3 ± 1.9 mg/l/day), while the acetic acid (30.14 mg/l/day on 70th day to 26.67 mg/l/day on 90th day) and formic acid (42.57 mg/l/day on 70th day to 29.78 mg/l/day on 90th day) showed gradual decrement. On the contrary, the butanol synthesis (40.87 mg/l/day on 70th day to 62 mg/l/day on 90th day) increased substantially during these days indicating the shift in metabolic pathway. Overall, the total product synthesized during 90 days of operation is about 34.28 g/l (Table 1 ) with a production rate of 233.26 mg/l/day of alcohol synthesis and 147.67 mg/l/day of organic acids. After increased production of formic and acetic acids, the ethanol and butyric acid production pathways were triggered by 20th day of operation at a rate of 1.5 g/m2/day and 2.2 g/m2/day respectively with each 4.8% CE in 21% of total CE. From then, the CE accounted for formic and acetic acids showed a gradual reduction and became consistent with ∼1% and ∼2% respectively with a production rate of 2 ± 0.4 g/m2/day and 1.5 ± 0.12 g/m2/day respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the butyric acid production also increased step by step, i.e., 2.45 ± 0.05 g/m2/day between 25 and 40 days with ∼ 5% CE, 3.35 ± 0.35 g/m2/day between 45 and 60 days with 6–8% CE and 4.4 ± 0.1 g/m2/day between 65 and 90 days with 9–9.5 CE. Overall, the butyric acid contributed about 15–24% of total product from day 20 to day 90 of operation with an average production rate of 4.6 g/m2/day. Both the ethanol and butanol production rates increased gradually with intermittent stationary phases, however, ethanol production was more progressive than butanol. After its first appearance on 20th day, ethanol production increased rapidly to 2.72 g/m2/day (with 8% CE) on 25th day followed by 3.2 g/m2/day (with 9.6% CE) on 30th day which stagnated at more or less similar value till 40th day. Further operation showed again gradual increment in ethanol production till 70th day (8.46 g/m2/day with ∼26% CE) and remained at almost similar value till the end of operation, indicating the consistent production of ethanol of about 45% in total product. On the other hand, butanol production started around 30th day (0.71 g/m2/day with 2.6% CE) and increased gradually to 1.88 g/m2/day (with 6.8% CE) which stagnated for next 15 days followed by gradual increment till the end of operation reaching 3.12 g/m2/day (with 11.56% CE) in 25 days. Butanol production occupied about 16% of the total product with an average production rate of 3.12 g/m2/day in 90 days (Fig. 4 ). Overall, the acid intermediates production was higher during start-up days of experiment with 17–23 g/m2/day which decreased with time till 40th day and remained more or less at similar value (7.9 ± 0.5 g/m2/day with 10–13% CE) till the end of operation, though the individual acid production rates varied. While, the alcohol production showed progressive increment with each day of operation from 1 g/m2/day (with 2.4% CE) to 11.7 g/m2/day (37.1% CE), indicating the switching over of metabolic pathways for increased reduction reactions as the organic acids accumulated (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Analyzing the head-space gas of the feed bottle did not show any H2 or CH4 gas productions, which are considered to be the major electron sinks for the electron loss in MES (Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2017). Hence, the total CE of 49% observed by the end of operation can be attributed to the products synthesized and the rest of the electrons can be considered lost due to the catalytic currents of the carbon layer of the GDE as well as the microbial metabolism for their growth and some mass transfer issues."
8,Bioprocess monitoring during CO2 transformation,"3.2 Bioprocess monitoring during CO2 transformation Change in various bioprocess parameters, like pH, DO, TOC, TIC were also monitored along with current consumption and product concentrations to understand the metabolic shifts with respect to time of operation (Fig. 5 ). Synergistic interaction of the biocatalyst with the working electrode is the main basis for the electron uptake (Srikanth et al., 2011) and its further utilization towards CO2 biotransformation. However, during the process, solubility of CO2 (measured as TIC) and its bioavailability has significant role. Similarly, pH of the electrolyte determines the CO2 solubility as well as shift in the metabolic activities of the biocatalyst (Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2016; LaBelle et al., 2014). On the other hand, DO of the electrolyte is also important to maintain the anaerobic conditions at working electrode favoring reduction reaction and thus preventing the electron loss through oxidation. Above all, the accumulation of acid intermediates triggers the other reducing metabolic pathways in the biocatalyst resulting in solventogenesis (Srikanth and Venkata Mohan, 2014). Significant changes in product titers as well as product slate at different time intervals of operation can be attributed to the cumulative effect of all these factors, which were studied under bioprocess monitoring throughout operation. Change in pH and DO were monitored on daily basis, while the others were monitored at every 5 days interval. The initial pH of the electrolyte at working electrode was set to 8.0 which allowed higher CO2 solubility accounting for about 1.24 g/l TIC on day 5 and upon solubility, it resulted in pH drop to 7.72. The pH drop continued further with time till 20th day (4.36) and started increasing again and by 40th day reached again above 5.0. Along similar lines, the TIC also decreased against time and suddenly dropped from 960 mg/l on 15th day to 342 mg/l on 20th day resulting in low CO2 availability. This drop in pH is also due to the accumulation of formic and acetic acids during this time which accounted for 262.5 mg/l/day. At this juncture, availability of DO helps the bacteria to oxidize acid intermediates and regain normal metabolic activities but in this system, the DO remained very low (0.2 ± 0.06 mg/l) throughout the operation. This has consistently maintained anaerobic condition at working electrode and supported the electron uptake activity of the microbes. Accumulation of acid intermediates coupled with lower pH disturbs the cytosolic pH of microbes by free flow of undissociated acids into cytosol and to sustain this all redox shuttlers (NAD+, FAD+, FMN+, etc.) come into action by accepting the H+ ions. However, this creates a deficiency of available redox shuttlers that ultimately leads to the triggering of solventogenesis (Srikanth and Venkata Mohan, 2014). This drop in pH along with accumulation of acid intermediates instigated the ethanol production pathway as well as chain elongation of acetic acid to butyric acid. Further operation showed decrement in the production rates of formic and acetic acids but increased the ethanol, butanol and butyric acid production rates, where there is a possibility of higher reduction. After 45th day, the pH of the system again lowered due to accumulation of butyric acid along with acetic and formic acids. This situation again reduced the solubility of CO2 to 286 on 55th day, which clearly shows the impact of pH. This has again created a necessity of triggering more reduction pathway that has resulted in butanol production. Once the butanol production started increasing, the pH of the system again increased to 5.0 and above. The measured TOC parallel to the TIC showed linear increment throughout the operation representing the consistent CO2 biotransformation, either to acids or alcohols. The biocatalyst used in this study is selectively enriched in presence of formic acid and CO2 partial pressure, which was proven to produce up to C4 organics like butyric acid and butanol at the enrichment stage itself. Henceforth, the application of GDE along with the selectively enriched culture that has ability to produce higher organics was studied for transforming CO2. This has resulted in significant increment in product concentrations, especially alcohols. The solubilized CO2 at the carbon layer of GDE that drew high catalytic current might have helped in converting CO2 into formic acid through microbial metabolism. This has led the microbial metabolism towards Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The consistent maintenance of formic acid concentration throughout the operation strongly supports the exploration of Wood-Ljungdahl pathway by the selective biocatalyst and also, the formic acid acted as hydrogen carrier for reduction reactions. Though the current densities as well as alcohol production rates observed in this study are higher than the available literature, upscaling of MES is still a long way to go due to the limitations of CO2 solubility, effective microbe-electrode interactions, increasing the electron transfer rate or reducing the electron losses, enhanced reaction rates, improved reactor design, etc. (Guo et al., 2015; Aryal et al., 2017). Even after using GDE, the solubility of CO2 is still on lower side (averaging to 0.4 g/l in terms of TIC) and it fluctuates highly with pH of the electrolyte. On the other hand, altering pH results in more acids or alcohols production which conflicts with CO2 solubility. Henceforth, research efforts in the direction of designing an efficient reactor for higher CO2 solubility along with a biocatalyst having ability to transform CO2 at faster rates is essentially required."
9,Conclusions,"Application of GDE was studied for the CO2 transformation in bioelectrocatalytic process using selectively enriched biocatalyst for 90 days. Formic and acetic acid production started immediately, whose accumulation triggered the stronger reduction pathways for ethanol and butanol production as well as butyric acid synthesis. GDE supported the CO2 solubility, which resulted in higher current consumption (averaging to 9–11 A/m2) and product formation (21 g/l of alcohols and 13 g/l of organic acids in 90 days) with a CE of 49%. Ethanol and butanol occupied respectively about 45% and 16% of total product which evidenced the larger potential of this technology."
