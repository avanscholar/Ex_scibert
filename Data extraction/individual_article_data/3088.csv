0,Introduction,"In recent years, the rapid development of industrialization and population have brought significant threat to the supply of clean water and sustainable energy [1]. Nuclear energy, biomass energy, tidal energy and hydrogen energy have been considered as the renewable energy sources to deal with the energy crisis [2]. Among them, hydrogen energy has aroused widespread attention because of its low pollutant, environmental friendliness, high combustion efficiency, and sustainability [3]. To date, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution has been proven as one of the most desirable approaches with the advantages of eco-friendly, clean and low cost [4-6], which has attracted more and more scholars'attentions [7]. Besides, the pollution in water resource caused by the organic dyes (e. g. methylene blue (MB) used in various fields of paper, plastic, or leather industries) would cause permanent eye burns, nausea, or other damaging influences [8,9]. Therefore, preparation of the multifunctional photocatalysts that can be used for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes has important implications [10,11]. CdS (Eg = 2.4 eV) is one of the most important transitionmetalsulfides, which is widely used in photoresistor, chemical sensor, photovoltaic (solar), and photocatalysis due to its polymorphic structures and unique photochemical properties [12-16]. However, the photo-corrosion of CdS always hinders its practical application [17]. It is well known that doping the Zn2+ ions is an efficient method to improve the photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS [18]. Since that the bandgap (Eg) of the CdxZn1-xS solid-solutions can be adjusted through changing the molar ratio of Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions [19]. Furthermore, additional energy levels can be introduced by the Zn vacancies, which would play a vital role in regulating the charge transfer, improving the photocatalytic activity and stability [20]. C. Feng et al. synthesized the g-C3N4/CNTs/CdZnS nanocomposites with the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 28.74 mmolg−1 h−1 [21]. S. Qi et al. applied the core–shell g-C3N4@Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunction photocatalyst for degrading MB and the degradation efficiency remained at 95% after four cycles reaction [22]. Moreover, the magnetic Fe2O3 is considered as a promising photocatalyst with superior superparamagnetic [23]. By coupling Fe2O3 with CdxZn1-xS solid solutions, a direct Z-scheme heterojunction can be formed,which can retain the electrons with stronger reducibility on the conduction band of CdxZn1-xS and the holes with stronger oxidize ability on the valence band of Fe2O3 and then enhance the photocatalytic efficiency [24]. In addition, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a typical two-dimensional carbon material, which has superior mobility of charge carriers, large surface area, and good chemical stability [25]. In this work, we reported firstly a simple hydrothermal methodto prepare the direct Z-scheme CdxZn1-xS nanorods-Fe2O3 quantum dots heterojunctions/rGO (CdxZn1-xS-FG) nanocomposites, which had the excellent photocatalytic activity for degrading organic dyes and producing hydrogen. By adjusting the molar ratio of Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions in precursor mixtures, the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG (Cd0.3Zn0.7S-Fe2O3/rGO) nanocomposites displayed the highest H2 evolution rate of 26.8 mmol h−1 g−1 and the highest degradation efficiency of 97.32% towards MB in 120 min under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic mechanism reaction was clearly explained by UPS, scavenging experiment and UV–Vis absorptionspectra."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Thiourea, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, sodium nitrate, potassium permanganate, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, ethylenediamine, thioglycolic acid (TGA), graphite, hydrogen peroxide, FeCl2·4H2O, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, FeCl3·6H2O, citric acid and PEG-4000 are all analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,"Preparation of CdxZn1-xS NRs, Fe2O3 QDs and graphene oxide (GO)","2.2 Preparation of CdxZn1-xS NRs, Fe2O3 QDs and graphene oxide (GO) The CdxZn1-xS NRs were prepared via a hydrothermal process. In the typical synthesis, 1 mmol of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 1-x mmol (x = 1, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 ml of mixed solution (10 ml of ethylenediamine and 10 ml of deionized water), followed by magnetic stirring for 1 h, then 3 mmol of thiourea was added slowly into the complex. After stirring for 2 h vigorously, the mixture solution was transferred into the Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and taken out. The CdxZn1-xS NRs were washed by deionized water and ethanol for three times, collected by centrifugation, and then dried at 60 °C for 4 h to get the powder. The preparation of Fe2O3 QDs and GO can be found in the supporting information [26,27]."
4,Preparation of CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites,"2.3 Preparation of CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites 0.0194 g of CdxZn1-xS NRs were mixed in 100 ml of deionized water under magnetic stirring to form solution A. 150 μL of TGA was dissolved in the solution A to form the CdxZn1-xS NRs-COOH aqueous solution (solution B). 0.046 g of Fe2O3 QDs and 0.046 g of citric acid were dissolved in 250 ml of deionized water with mechanical stirring to form the Fe2O3 QDs-OH aqueous solution (solution C). Meanwhile, 0.01 g of graphene oxide were dispersed in 10 ml of deionized water by ultrasound to form solution D. Solution B and solution C were mixed together under mechanical stirring. Two hours later, solution D was added to the above mixed solution drop by drop with mechanical stirring vigorously. At last, the mixed solution was transferred into the Teflon-lined autoclave at the preset temperature of 140 °C for 12 h. The final product was washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, then the powder was dried at 60 °C for 4 h."
5,Characterization of products,"2.4 Characterization of products XRD (X-ray powder diffraction) pattern was used to analyze the structure of CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites (MAC Science MXP-18, Cu Kα). The morphology of samples was investigated by JEM-2100 electron TEM (transmission electron micrographs) and HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy). The UPS (ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy) experiments were performed on a He Ⅰ lamp (21.22 eV). XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectrum) pattern was collected on a Vgescalab MK II X-ray system, with the monochromatic Mg Kα as radiation source (hν = 1253.6 eV), the peak at 284.6 eV of the C 1 s was used as the criterion. The powder samples of CdxZn1-xS-FG were pressed into the thin discs (13 mm in diameter) for XPS and UPS tests. The Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 was used to measure the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectra. The Nova l000 analyzer was used to estimate the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent response were conducted by an electrochemical work station (CHI-660C Instruments, China). Liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy (LCMS) was applied for detecting the degradation intermediates. The extract (5 μL) was injected into a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (LC) equipped with Eclipse Plus C18 column (4.6 mm * 100 mm, 5 μm; Agilent Technologies) and 0.1% formic acid solution/acetonitrile as the mobile phase at the speed of 0.5 ml/min. The carrier gas was N2. The gradient LC separation was coupled with a mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Q Exactive), which was performed in the negative mode on a mass spectrometer, ion source was HESI. The Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer was used to obtain the UV–Vis absorption spectra. Vibrating sample magnetometer (Lake Shore 7407) was used to collect the magnetic hysteresis loop."
6,Photocatalytic degradation measurement,"2.5 Photocatalytic degradation measurement 10 mg of CdxZn1-xS-FG photocatalysts were dissolved in MB water solution (50 ml, 7 mg/l). Before visible light illumination, the CdxZn1-xS-FG photocatalysts were magnetically stirred for 30 min in the absence of visible light to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the Xe lamp (CEL-HXUV300) was used as the visible light source, and the reaction suspension (2 ml) was taken out at an interval of 20 min. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency was achievedby monitoring the change of MB peak in the UV–Vis spectra. The degradation efficiency is calculated following the expression: Degradation e f f i c i e n c y % = 1 - A t / A 0 × 100 % where A0 was the initial dye absorbance of MB, At was residual MB absorbance at t time. The photocatalytic stability and scavenging experiments were also performed by the same approach."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment was performed in a Pyrex top irradiation reaction flask at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Typically, 50 mg of CdxZn1-xS-FG photocatalyst were added in Na2S (0.35 M) and Na2SO3 (0.25 M) aqueous solution (150 ml), and the oxygen in reaction flask was removed by flowing nitrogen for 30 min at room temperature. The 300 W Xe arc lamp (CEL-HXUV 300, a 420 nm cutoff filter) was used as the visible-light source to irradiate the suspension. And the irradiation area was controlled at about 1.0*1.0 cm2. The accumulated amount of H2 evolution was monitored by the gas chromatograph (GC-7900) in the air-tight continuous flow environment."
8,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a depicts the XRD patterns of CdS, ZnS, Fe2O3, rGO and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites. After the ultrasonication and hydrothermal treatment, GO nanosheets would be exfoliated, and a weak and broad diffraction peak can be detected at 24.12°, which corresponds to the (002) diffraction peak of rGO [27]. The diffraction peaks of CdS, ZnS and Fe2O3 can be assigned to the hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 41–1049) [17,28], the hexagonal ZnS (JCPDS No. 39–1450) [29] and the cubic Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 39–1346) [30], respectively. For the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites, the characteristic (311) peak of Fe2O3 and the (002) peak of rGO (002) could be discerned, suggesting the presence of Fe2O3 and rGO in the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites. Fig. S1 (a) shows the XRD pattern of CdxZn1-xS NRs. As the value of × decreased, the diffraction peaks continuously shift to the higher angle, the corresponding crystal phase changes from the hexagonal wurtzite structure of CdS to ZnS, which is the same as the XRD patterns of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites (x = 1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0 (Fig. 1b). As compared with the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs (Fig. S1 (b) the black rectangle), the diffraction peaks of Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites slightly shift to the lower angle. The results indicate that the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites is not a simple physical mixture of CdxZn1-x NRs, Fe2O3 QDs and rGO [31]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the detailed structure, morphology, and growth mechanism of Fe2O3 QDs, CdxZn1-xS NRs and CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites are investigated by TEM and HRTEM. In Fig. 2a, the Fe2O3 QDs with the average diameter of 10.55 nm are uniform but agglomerate. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.27 nm (Fig. 2b) matches well with the (104) planes of Fe2O3 [32]. Fig. 2c shows that the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs are smooth without any impurities. The lattice spacing of the (002) plane is about 0.32 nm (Fig. 2d). After coupling Fe2O3 QDs and CdxZn1-xS NRs with rGO (Fig. 2e), the CdxZn1-xS NRs-Fe2O3 QDs heterojunctions disperse on the surface of the ultrathin rGO nanosheets without evident variation. Noting that several pairs of staggered lattice fringes at the interface of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs-Fe2O3 QDs can be observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 2f). Consequently, the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites had been constructed successfully [33-35]. The growth mechanism of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites has been illustrated in Fig. 2g. It can be seen that the surface of Fe2O3 QDs and CdxZn1-xS NRs are modified by OH groups and COOH groups, respectively. Thus, the Fe2O3 QDs can be bonded to the CdxZn1-xS NRs by the COO groups. Meanwhile, the CdxZn1-xS NRs-Fe2O3 QDs heterojunctions are readily formed on the surface of rGO via van der Waals force [36]. The surface composition and the chemical state of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs, GO, Fe2O3 QDs and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites are studied by XPS spectra. The C, Cd, Zn, S, O and Fe elements can be found in the XPS survey spectrum of Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites (Fig. 3 a). The high-resolution binding energy spectra for C, Cd, Zn, S and Fe elements can be seen in Fig. 3b-f, respectively. The C 1 s peak for GO (Fig. 3b) can be decomposed into three Gaussian peaks at around 288.8, 287.1 and 284.8 eV, corresponding to the OCOH, CO and CC groups, respectively [37]. For the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites, the OCOH and CO peaks are dramatically reduced, indicating that the oxygen-containing functional groups are efficiently removed and the GO is reduced to rGO after the hydrothermal treatments [38]. As shown in Fig. 3c-e, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd, Zn and S for Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs exhibits the Cd 3d 3/2 and Cd 3d 5/2 peak at 404.7 and 411.5 eV, the Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 peak at 1021.1 and 1044.1 eV, the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peak at 161.2 and 162.4 eV, which are typical values for Cd2+ ions in CdS [39], Zn2+ ions in ZnS [40], and S2- ions in ZnS, respectively [41]. For Fe2O3 QDs (Fig. 3f), there are two peaks centered at 711.6 and 725.0 eV, corresponding to the Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 peak of Fe2O3, respectively [42]. Compared with Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs, the binding energy of Cd, Zn and S shifts to the higher direction, the binding energy of Fe shifts to the lower direction for the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites. It can be attributed to the partial electron transfer from the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs to the Fe2O3 QDs [43], resulting in the strong electronic interaction between Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs, which is helpful to improve its photocatalytic activity [44]. The energy band positions for the CdxZn1-xS NRs can be evaluated by the UV–Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4 ). It can be seen that the ZnS NRs exhibit the absorption peak in the UV region and the CdxZn1-xS NRs (x = 1, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1) display the absorption peak in the visible light region. As the Zn2+ doped ratio increased, the position of the absorption peak blue shifts and the color of the samples changes from orange to white gradually, suggesting the tunable energy band structures [45]. The Eg of CdxZn1-xS NRs can be calculatedby the equation below: α h ν = A h ν - E g 1 / 2 where A is a constant, α is the absorption coefficient, and hν is photon energy, respectively. The corresponding Eg are estimated to be 2.23 eV (CdS), 2.30 eV (Cd0.9Zn0.1S), 2.45 eV (Cd0.7Zn0.3S), 2.54 eV (Cd0.5Zn0.5S), 2.64 eV (Cd0.3Zn0.7S), 3.30 eV (Cd0.1Zn0.9S) and 3.49 eV (ZnS), respectively. Consequently, the Eg of the CdxZn1-xS NRs can be controlled from 2.23 to 3.49 eV. Moreover, the positions of conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) for CdxZn1-xS NRs can be evaluated by the theoretical calculations according to the following equations [46]: (1) E C = χ Cd x ∗ χ Zn 1 - x ∗ - 1 / 2 E g + E 0 (2) E V = E C + E g Where χCd = 4.3, χZn = 4.45, χS = 6.22 is the electronegativities of the Cd, Zn, and S elements, E0 = -4.50 eV is the standard hydrogen electrode, EC and EV are the energy levels of the CBM and VBM. The calculated EC and EV of the CdxZn1-xS NRs are presented in Fig. 4c and Table 1 . It can be seen that the EC values of the CdxZn1-xS NRs reduce graduallyas the value of × increased, which is beneficial for improving the reducing ability of the electrons on the conduction band. Fig. 5 and Fig. S2 exhibit the PL spectra of the CdxZn1-xS-FG (x = 0.9, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1) nanocomposites, ZnS and CdS NRs. The PL spectrum of the Cd0.9Zn0.1S-FG nanocomposites exhibits three peaks centered at 488 nm [47] (zinc vacancy coming from ZnS NRs Fig. S2a), 530 nm [48] (the direct electron-hole recombination of band transition from CdS NRs Fig. S2b), and 570 nm [49,50] (S vacancies), respectively. It’s obvious that the peak intensity of the zinc vacancies decreases until the doped ratio of the Zn2+ ions decreased to 70%, proving that the Zn2+ ions play an important role in affecting the transfer and recombination of photo-generated charge carriers and the best doping concentration of the Zn2+ ions maybe 70%. The average PL decay lifetime of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites is also calculated and presented in Fig. 5b and Table 2 . Among them, the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites possess the longest average lifetime (12.01 ns), which is beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction [51]. Both transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are powerful tools in studying the separation and transfer of the electron-hole pairs. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites display the highest photocurrent density than the others, indicating its lowest recombination efficiency of the photogenerated e--h+ pairs. Generally, the smaller radius of the arc semicircle in the EIS spectrum reflects the lower interface electron transfer resistance [52]. Fig. 6b shows that the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites present the minimum diameter, indicating its highest charge transfer rate. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 6c. It exhibits the type-IV isotherms, proving the characteristic of mesoporous. The Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites show a larger specific surface area of 245.85 m2 g−1, which is 5 times than that of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs. And the average pore size of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites and Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs are 5.81 and 6.73 nm, respectively. Consequently, rGO play a key role in enhancing the surface area. The VSM curves of the Fe2O3 QDs and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites show the superparamagnetic property at room temperature in Fig. 6d. The saturation magnetization value of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites is lower than that of the Fe2O3 QDs, mainly due to the lower mass content of the Fe2O3 QDs in the nanocomposites. Moreover, the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites can be readily separated by the external magnet in 40 s without complex purification process (the inset figure in Fig. 6d). To investigate the photocatalytic hydrogen production properties of the CdxZn1-xS- FG nanocomposites, the hydrogen evolution experiments are conducted under visible light irradiation (with λ ≥ 420 nm), 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution as the hole sacrificial agent. As presented in Fig. 7 a, there is no H2 detected when the experiment is carried out without photocatalyst or light irradiation. The H2 evolution rate of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-G, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F is 5.7, 10.3 and 22.4 mmol h-1g−1, respectively. Noting that the H2 evolution rate of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites is increased to 26.8 mmol h−1 g−1 , which is 4.7, 2.6, 1.2 times higher than that of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-G and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F, respectively. The excellent photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the following factors: (1) the formation of the heterojunctions between the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs would inhibit the recombination of photo generated e--h+ pairs [53], (2) the presence of rGO can disperse the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs-Fe2O3 QDs heterojunctions and increasethe surface area [54]. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 7b. As the value of × decreases from 1 to 0.3, the photocatalytic H2 production of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites increases to the maximum value of 26.8 mmol h−1 g−1. As the doped ratio of the Zn2+ ions increased, the number of the zinc vacancies would increase, which can provide more catalytic active sites, thus increasing the photocatalytic H2 evolution [55]. Fig. 7c shows that the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites display the maximum cumulative H2 production, indicating its excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. In addition, the durability and reusability of the photocatalysts are also crucial for the practical applications. The recycling tests of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites are performed under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 7d). It is worth noting that the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F nanocomposites exhibits a slight decrease after five cycles, which due to the photo-corrosion during the photocatalytic reaction [56,57]. Whereas the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites can maintain their photocatalytic H2 evolution activity without evident inactivation after five cycles, which can be attributed to the close interaction between the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-Fe2O3 heterojunctions and rGO [58]. The photocatalytic activity of the CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites are also evaluated by photodegrading MB under visible light irradiation. The suspension is mechanically stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium in the absence of visible light. The blank lines in Fig. 8 (a-d) indicate that the photolysis of MB is negligible without photocatalyst. Fig. 8a and c show that the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites exhibits the highest photocatalytic degradation activity compared with that of Fe2O3 QDs, Cd0.3Zn0.7S, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-G, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F and the other CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites (Fig. 8e). The process of photodegrading MB is shown in Fig. 8b, which is found to be the pseudo-first-order kinetics: l n C / C 0 = - k t where C0 is the initial concentration of MB (mg L-1), C is the concentration of MB (mg L-1) at a specific time t (min), and the slope k is the apparent rate constant (min−1) [59]. The k value of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites is 3.02 × 10-2 min−1, which is higher than that of the Fe2O3 QDs, Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-G, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F and the other CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites (Fig. 8f). As depicted in Fig. S3, the cycling photocatalytic stability tests of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-F, Cd0.3Zn0.7S-G and Cd0.3Zn0.7S nanocomposites are also conducted for five successive runs. It can be seen that the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG photocatalysts exhibit the best photostability and reusability, and the degradation rate remains almost the same after each cycle reaction. The UV–Vis spectra of MB degraded by the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites are showed in Fig. S4. There is a continuous decrease and blue shift for the absorption peak of MB centered at 667 nm. It indicates that the functional groups of MB, such as the N-methyl groups (N–CH3) and the imino groups (–CN–), are gradually cleaved to the low molecular weight compounds by active species [60]. The LCMS tests are used to investigate the products after the photocatalytic process. The peaks in the chromatograms can prove the formation of various intermediates during the MB degradation [61]. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the MB is degraded to the fragment ions at m/z = 284 after 15 min. With the time increased to 120 min, the MB is resolved into small molecules with the m/z = 366, 354, 256, 228. The possible three pathways of degradation can be seen in Fig. 9e [62]. Under the visible light irradiation, the N–CH3 and –CN– groups in the MB molecular structure can easily cleaved by the active radical species or ozone, forming the innocuous low molecular weight compounds, e. g. CO2, H2O or other gases [63,64]. Consequently, the photodegrade process using CdxZn1-xS-FG nanocomposites is environmentally friendly for wastewater treatment. In order to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism, UPS is characterized (Fig. 10 a and 10b). The Wf (work function), EC and EV of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs can be estimated based on the following equations [65]: (1) Wf = 21.22 - E1 (2) EV = Wf + E2 (3) EC = EV - Eg (4) ENHE = –EAVS – 4.5 where E1 is the upper emission onset energy, E2 is the lower emission onset energy, ENHE is the energy of normal hydrogen electrode and EAVS is the energy of absolute vacuum. The EC and EV values of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs are presented in Table 3 . Fig. 10c is the UV–Vis spectra of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs. The Eg values of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs are 2.64 and 2.56 eV, respectively. Therefore, the energy levels of the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs are shown in Fig. 10d based on the results of UPS and UV–Vis spectra. Under the visible light irradiation, the photo generated holes on the valence band of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs can not oxidize the H2O molecules into •OH, because the EV of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs (2.03 eV vs. NHE) is more negative than the potential of H2O/•OH (2.4 eV vs. NHE). Similarly, the accumulated photo-generated electrons on the conduction band of Fe2O3 QDs (0.1 eV vs. NHE) can not reduce O2 into the active species •O (-0.33 eV vs. NHE). Fig. 11 shows the influence of different scavengers on the MB photodegradation using Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites as the photocatalysts under visible light irradiation for 120 min. The active species h+, •OH or •O are trapped by EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate), t-BuOH (tert-butyl alcohol), and BQ (1,4-benzoquinone) [66], respectively. Therefore, both •OH and •O are the main active species during the photodegradation MB process under visible light irradiation. Based on the above experimental results, the possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism can be seen in Fig. 12 . Under the visible light irradiation, the photo-generated electrons on the conduction band of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs will transfer to the conduction band of Fe2O3 QDs. Meanwhile, the photo-generated holes on the valence band of Fe2O3 QDs will transfer to the valence band of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs, a conventional type-II heterostructure would form between the Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs (Fig. 12a). However, the accumulated photo-generated electrons on the conduction band of Fe2O3 QDs, and the accumulated photogenerated holes on the valence band of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs would not be beneficial for producing •O and •OH, which is inconsistent with the scavengers experiments. Therefore, the migration pathway of the photo-generated carriers follows the direct Z-scheme mechanism, as shown in Fig. 12b. The photo-generated electrons transfer from the conduction band of Fe2O3 QDs to the valence band of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs. Thus, the electrons with strong reducibility and the holes with strong oxidizability can be preserved, taking part in the surface photocatalytic reaction. Fig. 12c is the schematic diagram of the photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. The photo-generated electrons on the surface of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs would trigger the hydrogen evolution reaction. The photo-generated holes on the surface of Fe2O3 QDs will be consumed by the Na2S and Na2SO3 sacrificial reagents."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we successfully designed and synthesized a direct Z-scheme CdxZn1-xS-Fe2O3 heterojunctions/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites with superior photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic degradation of MB and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The results showed that the Cd0.3Zn0.7S-FG nanocomposites exhibited the highest H2 evolution rate of 26.8 mmol h−1 g−1 and the highest degradation efficiency of MB of 97.32% in 120 min under the visible light irradiation. The bandgap of CdxZn1-xS solid solutions can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio of the Zn2+ to Cd2+ ions. The Z-scheme heterojunctions between Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and Fe2O3 QDs would retain the stronger reducibility of Cd0.3Zn0.7S NRs and the stronger oxidability of Fe2O3 QDs. rGO played a key role to prevent the agglomeration of the CdxZn1-xS-Fe2O3 heterojunctions."
