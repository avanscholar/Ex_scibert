0,Introduction,"As one of the top value-added chemical candidates listed in the DOE/NREL report [1], GVL has attracted considerable attention due to its outstanding physicochemical properties in recent decades. High boiling point (approximate 207 °C), low vapor pressure (3.5kpa at 80 °C), and good low-temperature fluidity make it easy to be stored and transported in long distance. Due to its low toxicity and fruit flavor, it can be added to food and drink as the additive. In addition, several reports have demonstrated that GVL as a green solvent is exceedingly efficient to improve biomass conversion by dissolving biomass and humins, facilitating the formation of product and suppressing the product degradation [2,3]. More importantly, it can be used as an ideal precursor for the production of numerous valuable chemicals and biofuels, such as dimethyl adipate [4,5], 1,4-pentanediol [6], valeric esters [7], 5-fluorenone [8,9], and long-chain alkanes (e.g., C8-C18 alkanes) [10,11], which is conducive to alleviate the reliance on fossil fuels in modern society [12–14]. Catalytic hydrogenation of biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) or its esters to produce GVL is the widely used method in view of its low energy consumption [15]. A number of heterogeneous catalysts have been developed and it was found that noble metal (Ru, Ir, Rh, Pd, Re, etc.) based catalysts exhibited excellent performance [16–22]. However, the limitations of being high cost, prone to deactivation and difficult to regenerate restricted its practical application [23–25]. Recently, an alternative approach was developed to produce GVL by catalytic hydrogenation transfer based on MPV reduction Due to its highly chemoselectivity, carbonyl compounds can be reduced in mild conditions while the carboxyl or ester linkage is not affected [26]. In addition, using abundant and inexpensive alcohols as the reductant also shows significant economic advantages [27,28]. Some pioneered works have been done to explore different catalyst system and discover that Zr-containing catalytic system could efficiently convert LA or its esters to GVL [26,27,29–31]. For example, Mei Chia et al. reported that 80.4% of GVL could be obtained using ZrO2 as catalyst and secondary alcohol as hydrogen source [29]. Tang et al. found that the conversion of EL with 2-propanol over Zr(OH)4 at 200 °C giving an EL conversion of 93.6% and a GVL yield of 88.4% [25]. Other Zr-containing catalysts, such as Zr-β [32], Zr-TMPA [33], Al-Zr [34] and UiO-66(Zr) [35] were also explored. Most of them were prepared through traditional methods, e.g. sol–gel method, hydrothermal synthesis method, and co-precipitation method, which are relatively safe processes. However, the catalyst precursor is more expensive than common metals (Cu, Fe, Ni, Al) and the preparation processes are time-consuming, which would increase the cost and efforts. Due to the heterogeneity, a higher temperature (≥200 °C) or longer reaction time (≥5h) is still required in the reaction system. Therefore, we attempted to convert levulinates to GVL with an easily available noble-metal-free catalyst under mild conditions. Previous study proved that chiral Al complex was efficient for the C-O bond activation in carboxylic acids derivatives and exhibited excellence performance in MPV reduction [36]. In this study, classical Al(OiPr)3 was chosen as the hydrogenation catalyst, which is much cheaper and readily available. It has been used for the MPV reduction of unsaturated aromatic carbonyl compounds several years ago [37,38], but used for the reduction of ahenaliphatic ketones was rarely studied. The catalytic hydrogenation mechanisms were proposed by some researchers [39–41]. The generally accepted mechanism was the hydride transfer pathway via a six-ring complex in which the carbonyl compound and secondary alcohol were both bound to the Al center. The carbonyl was then activated upon the coordination to the Lewis acidic metal ion, followed by the hydride transfer from the alcoholate to the carbonyl group [39–40]. One alcohol molecular then replaced the reduction substrate binding to the Al center, and the reduction product could dissociate in solvents [42,43]. In fact, its application was shadowed by some modified catalysts with organic ligand or heterogeneous catalyst with several transition metals [41,44]. It was partially due to agglomeration of aluminum alkoxides, which resulted in the super-stoichiometric amounts dosage (1–20 equiv relative to substrate) [40]. In addition, the high recovery cost restricted the large-scale application [39]. However, we explored the catalytic effect of Al(OiPr)3 on GVL production and it exhibited fabulous catalytic activity with less amount than stoichiometric dose under mild conditions and the reaction pathway was different with reported heterogeneous Zr-containing catalysts. This result forced us to reassess application of Al(OiPr)3 on hydrogenation process and explore the detailed catalytic mechanism. Therefore, the effect of H-donors, reaction parameters including reaction temperature, residence time, the amount of catalyst, and the amount of alcohol on the GVL production were studied, which could provide thermodynamic data for the industrial evaluation in future. Furthermore, based on the results of kinetic experiment and LC/MS data, potential reaction routes of each step were proposed and supplemented with DFT calculations. Finally, a new plausible reaction pathway for the whole reaction via Al(OiPr)3 was proposed in detail. It is expected that our study will remotivate the application of metal alkoxide on the biofuel synthesis field and simultaneously give a theoretical support on the reaction mechanism."

All other chemicals (AR) were from Beijing Chemical Works and used without purification."
3,Comparative study of catalyst on GVL yield,"2.2 Comparative study of catalyst on GVL yield Comparative experiments of different catalysts were carried out in Milestone microwave lab station (Italy) equipped with sealed Teflon reaction vessels (100 mL). ZrO2 and Zr(OH)4 were prepared by precursor ZrOCl2·8H2O according to previous studies, respectably [30,27]. The reaction mixture consisted of 1 g ML, 19 g 2-propanol, 0.5 g catalyst. The reaction temperature was 180 °C and reaction times were set at 30, 60, and 120 min when ZrO2 was used as catalyst. The reaction was carried out at 200 °C in 40 min in the presence of Zr(OH)4. The reactions were conducted with Al(OiPr)3 for 30 min at 100 °C, 150 °C, and 200 °C, respectively. All of the reaction conditions were set to maximize the GVL yield for each catalyst."
4,Effect of reaction parameters on the production of GVL,"2.3 Effect of reaction parameters on the production of GVL The experiments were carried out in a 35-mL quartz pressure reaction vessel (PyNN Co. Ltd., USA). The H-donors, including ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol were explored. The reaction vessel was loaded with 0.5 g ML, 0.25 g Al(OiPr)3, and 10 g alcohols. The vessel was then heated to 150 °C (within 2 min) and maintained at this temperature for 30 min with a middle magnetic stirring. After the reaction, the vessel was cooled to 26 °C using forced-air cooling equipment. Liquid production was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS), respectively. Based on the GVL yield, the optimal alcohol was used for the further study. The reaction parameters of reaction temperature, residence time, the dosages of catalyst and the solvent were then discussed according to the reaction conditions presented in Table 1 ."
5,Kinetic experiments,"2.4 Kinetic experiments The 10-mL quartz pressure reaction vessel (PyNN Co. Ltd., USA) was loaded with 0.1 g ML, 1.6 g 2-propanol and 0.05 g Al(OiPr)3, and the mixture was heated to pre-set temperature (110–140 °C). After heating for a certain time (1–60 min), the vessel was cooled to 26 °C before being opened. The product was then quantitatively analyzed by GC instrument."
6,Sample analysis,"2.5 Sample analysis 2.5.1 GC/MS and GC analysis The sample analysis was conducted with an Agilent 5975C GC/MS Instrument with DB-5MS column (30.0 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and electron impact ionization (EI). The compositions of the resultants were quantitatively determined by a Shimadzu GC 2014C with a DB-5 column (30.0 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and an FID detector operating at 270 °C. N2 was the carrier gas and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The following programmed temperature was used: 50 °C (3 min) – 6 °C/min – 180 °C – 10 °C/min – 280 °C(3 min). The substrate conversion, GVL yield, GVL selectivity, GVL formation rate, IPL (Isopropyl levulinate) yield, and IPL selectivity were calculated by the following equations: Substrate c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = 1 - Mole o f s u b s t r a t e after reaction Initial m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e × 100 GVL y i e l d ( % ) = Mole o f G V L Initial m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e × 100 GVL s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = GVL y i e l d Substrate c o n v e r s i o n × 100 IPLyield ( % ) = Mole o f I P L Initial m o l e o f s u b s t r a t e × 100 IPL s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = IPL y i e l d Substrate c o n v e r s i o n × 100 2.5.2 LC/MS analysis For the identification of transition states (TSs) products, the sample was prepared under mild conditions (100 °C, 10 min) and analyzed by LC/MS (Thermos TSQ Quantum Ultra) equipped with a refractive index detector and a capillary column ultimate XB C18 (3um × 100 mm length). The mobile phase was the mixture of acetonitrile and water (80/20, v/v), the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. MS analysis in the negative ions mode was performed on a mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI ion source. The ESI sprayvolt was set at 3.5 kV and the mass scan range was 50–600 m/z. The heated capillary was set to 370 °C."
7,Computational method,"2.6 Computational method The computational calculation was performed to provide mechanistic understanding of the chemistry of the desired reaction catalyzed by Al(OiPr)3. All of the calculations were performed with Gaussian 16 package. The geometry optimizations in this study were carried out using the M062X-D3 method [45] with the basis set of def2-TZVP [46]. In the M062X-D3 method, the D3 term represented a dispersion correlation [47]. All the structures were fully relaxed, and vibrational frequencies were calculated. The initial geometries of transition structures were manually guessed and further verified by the presence of a single imaginary frequency and IRC (intrinsic reaction coordinate) calculations [48]. To account for the effects of solution environment around the catalytic active site, the calculations were performed in a 2-propanol dielectric using the SMD solvation model at the M062X level of theory with the same basis sets as used for the geometry evaluation [49]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Comparison of catalyst based on MPV reduction,"3.1 Comparison of catalyst based on MPV reduction To evaluate the catalytic activity of Al(OiPr)3, the comparative experiments with ZrO2 and Zr(OH)4 based on MPV reduction were carried out. As shown in Table 2 , 63.7% of GVL yield was obtained when Zr(OH)4 was used as catalyst in the absence of N2, which was much lower than the result obtained in N2 atmosphere reported by Tang et al. (Table 2, entry 5–6) [27]. This observation revealed that the reaction system with Zr(OH)4 might be sensitive to oxygen. When ZrO2 was used as catalyst, the maximum EL conversion (79.2%) and GVL yield (71.5%) were both higher than that with Zr(OH)4, it might be due to more catalytic sites (i.e.,Zr) existed with the same dosage of different catalysts (Table 2, entry 3,6). Howerve, these results was still lower than that reported by Tang (Table 2, entry 1,3) [30]. It indicated that ZrO2 was stable with presence of air, but it required high temperature to work efficiently (high energy consumption). Besides, prolonged reaction time resulted in a decrease in GVL yield (Table 2, entry 3–4), it might be because more side reactions occurred, such as aldol condensation between GVL, EL and acetone (dehydrogenation of isopropanol) [30,50]. A progressive deactivation of the catalyst would also be a reason for the lower catalytic activity [51]. On the other hand, Al(OiPr)3 could produce 48.9% of GVL at low temperature of 100 °C in 30 min with presence of air. When the temperature increased to 150 °C, the GVL yield arose to 85.2%, which was comparable to the Zr(OH)4 reported by Tang et al. (Table 2, entry 5, 7–9). The GVL production with Al(OiPr)3 can be identified as a time-saving and energy-efficient process. Hence, Al(OiPr)3 with high catalytic activity could be used for the further study."
10,The effect of H-donor,"3.2 The effect of H-donor Various alcohols as H-donors were evaluated on GVL production in this study (Table 3 ). The ML conversion with different alcohols except tert-butanol were all above 95%, and the secondary alcohols including 2-propanol and 2-butanol exhibited excellent performances with the GVL selectivity of 95.3% and 88.3%, respectively (Table 3, entry 4–5). In addition, the outstanding performance of 2-propanol was still observed when the substrate was replaced by EL and BL (Table 3, entry 7–8). When the primary alcohols were employed, most of ML was converted into corresponding levulinate esters through transesterification (Table 3, entry 1–3). This result indicated that Al(OiPr)3 could efficiently catalyze both of the transesterification and hydrogenation. The variation on the GVL production might be attributed to the differences between the reduction potentials of alcohols used. The reduction potential was represented as ability of providing H-atoms and defined as the difference of the standard molar enthalpy of formation between the alcohol and the corresponding carbonyl compound. Different alcohols based on the reduction potentials descended in the following order: n-propanol (87.3 KJ/mol) > ethanol (85.4 KJ/mol) > n-Butanol (79.7 KJ/mol) > 2-Propanol (70.0 KJ/mol) ≈ 2-butanol (69.3 KJ/mol) [52], which was in line with our results except n-propanol. In this case, alkyl chain length might be the dominate factor. The sum of the selectivity of GVL and levulinate esters was less than 100%, a small amount of by-products probably generated via aldol condensation, dehydration or derivative of intermediate and GVL (Figs. S1 and S2) [27,50,53]. The reaction with tertiary alcohol i.e. tert-Butanol gave a poor result of a ML conversion of 30.1% and a GVL selectivity of 15.1% (Table 3, entry 6). It was probably due to the steric effect suppressing the formation of transition state for its high stereo structure and electron density, and more side reactions occurred during the process."
11,The effect of the reaction parameters,"3.3 The effect of the reaction parameters The effect of reaction parameters including reaction temperature, residence time, the dosages of catalyst and the solvent was thoroughly investigated with 2-propanol being the H-donor. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the conversion of ML was complete under 130 °C. The GVL selectivity linearly increased from 67.4% to 95.3% as the reaction temperature increased from 130 °C to 150 °C. Further increase the temperature resulted in a slight drop in GVL yield, which might be due to the acceleration of side reaction [27]. Residence time was proved to be another dominate factor (Fig. 1b). Along with the increase of time from 10 min to 60 min, a maximum selectivity of GVL 95.3% was achieved at 30 min. It was noteworthy that IPL was generally formed at lower temperature or shorter time, and its selectivity declined as the GVL selectivity increased until it reached a constant value below 2%. Besides, the sum of the two products selectivity is generally above 90%. This phenomenon indicated that IPL might be an intermediate which was then converted to GVL. The catalyst dosage is an important parameter to measure the catalytic activity and the feasibility of industrial production. Hence, the experiments of various catalyst dosage were carried out in our study and the results were shown in Fig. 1c. A dramatic increase in GVL selectivity from 35.8% to 95.3% was observed as the catalyst dosage increased from 12.5% to 50%. At the same time, the selectivity of IPL decreased from 64.1% to 2.3%. These results revealed that transesterification could occur with lower dosage while the formation of GVL required high dosage. Taking the economic principle of industrial production into account, the solvent dosage also needs to be investigated (Fig. 1d). ML was mostly converted and GVL selectivity of 97.6% was higher than other dosages at the solvent loading of 16:1. Too low or too high loading would generate a certain amount of IPL, leading to the decrease in the selectivity of GVL. Hence, 16:1 was found to be the optimized dosage in this study."
12,Kinetic analysis,"3.4 Kinetic analysis The kinetics experiments were carried out over a range of temperature (Fig. 2, 110-140 °C, 10 °C for an interval). Previous studies hold that ML underwent hydrogenation and cyclization via an unstable intermediate, i.e. methyl 4-hydroxypentanoate, and IPL was formed as the by-product [54,55]. However, our kinetic experiments showed that a large amount of IPL was generated in early stage, and its rates of formation and removal were both proportional to temperature, which indicated that ML was more rapidly to undergo transesterification than hydrogenation. In addition, IPL could be efficiently converted to GVL as ML dose (Fig. S3). Based on these results, two plausible reaction pathways were proposed in Fig. S4. Due to the rapid nature of the methyl 4-hydroxyvalerate and isopropyl 4-hydroxyvalerate (4-HIPL) cyclization to GVL, hydrogenation and cyclization were combined as one step here. The kinetic equations for the reaction network were shown as follows: d C ML dt =- k 1 C ML Î± 1 C IPA β 1 - k 3 C ML Î± 1 C IPA β 3 d C IPL dt = k 1 C ML Î± 1 C IPA β 1 - k 2 C IPL Î± 2 C IPA β 2 d C GVL dt = k 2 C IPL Î± 2 C IPA β 2 + k 3 C ML Î± 1 C IPA β 3 where Ci terms were the molar concentration for species i, and ki was the apparent rate constant of step i. α i was the reaction order of ML or IPL in each step, and β i was for 2-propanol (IPA). In excess of 2-propanol, its difference of concentration could be negligible, and then the model equations could be simplified as follows: d C ML dt =- k 1 C ML Î± 1 - k 3 C ML Î± 1 d C IPL dt = k 1 C ML Î± 1 - k 2 C IPL Î± 2 d C GVL dt = k 2 C IPL Î± 2 + k 3 C ML Î± 1 The Matlab was used to optimise the rate constants and the results was summarized in Table 4 . Transesterification was fitted well to quasi-second-order model, and the two hydrogenation-cyclization steps were fitted to a first-order equation. In particular, the reaction rate constant of the transesterification was 8–20 times of the direct hydrogenation of ML to GVL at the same temperature. Compared to the ML, the hydrogenation of IPL to GVL was much slower. These results indicated that these two reaction pathways were both existed but the two-step process was the dominate one. As shown in Fig. 3 , the apparent activation energies (Ea) of hydrogenation-cyclization was higher than that of transesterification (38.8 vs 23.5 kcal/mol), indicating that the fomer was the rate-limiting step."
13,Reaction mechanism,"3.5 Reaction mechanism 3.5.1 Potential reaction routes To elucidate the whole reaction pathway, LC-MS was employed to detect the possible intermediate compounds of the reaction mixture. The chromatogram spectrum and the mass spectra of different retention time were shown in Fig S3 and Fig S4, respectively. The interpretation of main fragment ions in mass spectra was shown in Table 5 . As we can see, the ML molecular was bound to 2-proponal forming unstable complex, which was with K+ to give a specie at m/z 229.34. But the experiments have proven that no IPL was generated during the reaction without catalyst. Moreover, despite the fragments with m/z 205.05 and 222.95 were attributed to the combination of Al(OiPr)3 with H+ and H3O+, the catalyst could also be attached to the 2-proponal forming a four-coordinate aluminum complex, which was with H3O+ to give a specie at m/z 282.36. Based on these results, plausible transesterification routes were proposed in Scheme 1 . Due to the electrophilicity, the Al atom of Al(OiPr)3 was readily attract to the ester carbonyl oxygen which led the carbonyl carbon exhibiting relative strong electropositive property. The oxygen of 2-propanol was then connected to the ester carbonyl carbon and the hydrogen of 2-propanol attached to the ester oxygen forming an unstable TS1(Scheme 1a) [56]. Alternatively, the Al(OiPr)3 combined with 2-propanol and then the Al atom directly participated in the formation of TSs after attached to the ester carbonyl oxygen. In this case, the ester carbonyl carbon conected to the alkoxy oxygen of aluminum complex forming a four-centered TS2. After the electron transfer, a new linkage of C-O-Al was formed. The methoxy oxygen was then attached to the Al atom and a new four-centered TS3 was generated [57,58]. Through the electron transfer, IPL was finally formed (Scheme 1b). In addition, the Al atom of the complex could be also connected to the ester oxygen. As shown in Scheme 1c, a four-centered TS4 was probably formed via the connection of ester carbonyl carbon to alkoxy oxygen of aluminum complex [42]. IPL combined with one molecular of Al(OiPr)3, Na+ and H3O+ giving an unstable peak at m/z 404.46. It was inferred that hydride probably transferred from the alkoxy carbon of isopropoxide to the ketone carbonyl carbon of IPL through the TS1 (Scheme 2 ). The specie further released acetone and Na+ forming a specie with m/z 322.79. Subsequently, a solvent molecule attaching to the Al atom provided a proton via a four-centered TS2 that lead to the formation of 4-HIPL (isopropyl 4-hydroxyvalerate, m/z 179) and Al(OiPr)3. The mechanism of hydrogenation step was also in agreement with previous studies for the hydrogenation of ketones through MPV reduction [42,43]. Although the kinetic model of 4-hydroxy pentanoic acid or its esters converted to GVL has been explored by previous studies, to the best of our knowledge, the clear mechanism of ring-closure has not been reported yet [21,52]. Based on the experimentally inferred intermediate species and earlier studies, four possible routes were explored and proposed in scheme 3 . The first route was the intramolecular cyclization of 4-HIPL to GVL, which was in line with the easily reported studies for the catalytic conversion of LA to GVL in aqueous medium (Scheme 3a) [20,21]. In addition, the cyclization with the assistance of 2-propanol was confirmed by LC/MS data (Table 5, entry 13). As an electron transfer carrier, there was greater probability of 2-proponal involved in the formation of stable six-centered TS2 and promoted the ring-closure process (Scheme 3b). On the basis of this finding, Al(OiPr)3 was expected to be an alternative electron transfer carrier participating in the reaction (Scheme 3c). The last possible route was the inter-molecular cyclization between two molecules of 4-HIPL (Scheme 3d). The electron transfers probably occurred via a symmetric eight-center TS4 that produced two molecules of GVL. Unlike some other studies, the intermediates and TSs of direct hydrogenation of ML were not detected in this reaction system. Nevertheless, the possibility of direct hydrogenation still existed, and a detailed discussion would be done in the subsequent computational simulation section. 3.5.2 Computational results of possible reaction routes To find out the optimal route of the dominate pathway and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism, computational simulation was employed in our study. The free energy of each route of transesterification and cyclization process was shown in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b, respectively. Fig. 4a showed that the activation energy with route a was 48.0 kcal/mol, which was the highest energy barrier of these three routes. Between the two reaction routes assisted by aluminum complex (Route b and c), two-step process was completed with a 28.2 kcal/mol energy barrier, which was lower than the one-step process of 38.2 kcal/mol. The calculated free energies of four routes for the cyclization were shown in Fig. 4b. The intramolecular cyclization of 4-HIPL should overcome 48.5 kcal/mol energy barrier, which was higher than the 2-propanol route (37.8 kcal/mol, route b). Comparing to the Al(OiPr)3 and bis-molecule cyclization, 2-propanol route was also proved to be the optimal pathway. These observations revealed that the cyclization was properly carried out with the synergistic effect of 2-propanol, and other situations were almost impossible to occur. Based on the above conclusions, the reaction pathway could be completely drawn. The free energy and enthalpy profile were all shown in Fig. 5 . As we can see from the Fig. 5, transesterification was an exothermic reaction including two steps (P0 → P2). Al(OiPr)3 was firstly coordinated with one solvent molecule, followed by the isopropoxy transfer from the aluminum complex to the ester carbonyl carbon of ML (P0-P1) through the TS1. Subsequently, the methoxy oxygen was connected to the Al atom and then the methoxy was transferred to the Al(OiPr)3 (P1-P2). The hydrogenation was an exergonic and exothermic process (P2 → P5). Hydrogen transfer (R3) from the 2° carbon of isopropoxide to the ketone carbonyl carbon of IPL occurred forming the intermediate P3. Subsequently, the solvent molecule replaced acetone to form intermediate R4, the –OH of solvent provide a proton to complete a new hydrogen transfer. After the process, Al(OiPr)3 regenerated and the intermediate of 4-HIPL was formed (P4). Finally, GVL was generated through the cyclization, which was accomplished with one solvent molecule as a carrier of hydrogen transfer (P4-P5). The energy barrier of 37.4 kcal/mol of the cyclization made the hydrogenation-cyclization a rate-limiting step during the whole reaction, which was also in agreement with the experiment data. As mentioned above, the direct hydrogenation of ML was explored here. The reaction route was confirmed based on the hydrogenation of IPL. As shown in Fig. 6 ., the energy barrier (16.6 kcal/mol) was a little higher than that of IPL (14.3 kcal/mol), but lower than the transesterification process as shown above. This phenomenon confirmed the probability of direct hydrogenation of ML on the theoretical perspective. Taking the experimental data and LC/MS analysis the into account, direct hydrogenation of ML might account for an small part. This finding could be helpful for some other theoretical studies on catalytic hydrogenation of levulinate esters by alkoxides."
14,Conclusion,"Al(OiPr)3 exhibited a high performance on the catalytic hydrogenation transfer of ML to GVL. The process optimization showed that 97.6% of GVL was obtainable when 2-propanol was the H-donor and solvent without inert gas protection at 150 °C in 30 min. The transesterification occurred prior to the hydrogenation-cyclization, and its reaction activation energy were 23.5 kcal/mol. The hydrogenation-cyclization was regarded as the rate-limiting step with an activation energy of 38.8 kcal/mol. LC/MS data and computational results revealed that the transesterification was preceded through a two-step electron transfer with the activation of ester bond with Al atom as the transfer carrier, and then a two-step proton transfer occurred through carbonyl bond activation with Al atom to obtain 4-HIPL, followed by cyclization with the assistance of one molecular of 2-propanol to accomplish the reaction."
