0,Introduction,"With increasing energy demand, decreasing oil supply, and continuously accumulating waste in landfills, interest in converting lignocellulosic biomass to liquid and gaseous fuels has grown. The MixAlco™ is a flexible and cost-effective process (Agbogbo and Holtzapple, 2007). It employs a mixed culture of naturally occurring microorganisms to ferment biomass into carboxylate salts that can be converted into a wide array of chemicals (e.g., ketones, esters, alcohols) and fuels (e.g., jet fuel and gasoline) (Granda et al., 2009). The downstream processing steps of the MixAlco™ process necessitate the addition of hydrogen. Although hydrogen is the most abundant element, generation of gaseous hydrogen for hydrogenation reactions can be costly, with steam reforming and electrolysis being the two most common methods. New technologies for hydrogen production are being investigated, and microbial hydrogen production is a good alternative. Studies on fermentative hydrogen production have been conducted mostly using pure cultures (Evvyernie et al., 2001; Fabiano and Perego, 2002), although it is also a key intermediate from the anaerobic degradation of waste by a mixed culture (Lay et al., 1999; Mizuno et al., 2000; Sparling et al., 1997). It is difficult to predict hydrogen production from a mixed-acid fermentation. It has been reported in the literature (Chen et al., 2006; Demirel et al., 2010; Kawagoshi et al., 2005), although with wide fluctuations. Several models have been developed to predict fermentation end-products of both mixed acids and hydrogen (Offner and Sauvant, 2006; Rodriguez et al., 2006; Van Milgen, 2002; Xing et al., 2006), but with variable success. Every cellular reaction involves energy changes measured as Gibbs free energy. Because cells are very efficient, the net change in Gibbs free energy approaches zero for the sum of catabolic and anabolic reactions (Henry et al., 2006). The amount of catabolic energy microorganisms need to meet the anabolic demand depends on the specific fermentation system (e.g., temperature, pH, and substrate); therefore, hydrogen production is governed by the catabolic change in Gibbs free energy for a given system. (Heijnen, 1994; Tijhuis et al., 1993). This study uses the catabolic Gibbs free energy determined during batch fermentations of two feedstocks (paper and bagasse) to predict hydrogen production during continuous fermentations."
1,Methods,
2,Fermentors,"2.1 Fermentors Stainless-steel fermentors (SS) were used for all hydrogen fermentations. Each fermentor consisted of a 6-in.-long 4-in.-diameter Sch-10 stainless steel pipe sealed on each end with a 1/8-in.-thick stainless steel plate. The top plate of the fermentor was fitted with a quick-connect fitting (McMaster-Carr #4322K163), a 2-in. gasket (McMaster-Carr #4509K15) and cap (McMaster-Carr #4322K222) held in place by a tightened clamp (McMaster-Carr #4322K153). A ¼-in. quick-disconnect self-sealing valve was inserted into the cap for intermittent gas release (Swagelok #SS-QM2-B-400). To mix the contents, ¼-in. stainless steel tubing was bent back on itself and inserted into the mouth of the fermentor. The vessels proved to seal tightly; no pressure loss was detected after 10days with 10bar H2. The fermentors were placed on a Wheaton Modular Cell Production Roller Apparatus located in an incubator and rotated at 2rpm."
3,Substrates,"2.2 Substrates Two separate substrates were used in this study: used office paper and lime-pretreated sugarcane bagasse. Office paper was obtained from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University. Bagasse was obtained from the Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers. Chicken manure was obtained from the Poultry Science Department at Texas A&M University and was used as a nutrient source for the microorganisms. Because of its high lignin content, the bagasse was pretreated with lime (0.3g Ca(OH)2/g dry biomass) by submersion in a 60-L jacketed tank at 50°C. For 60days, air was bubbled up through the water/biomass. When the pretreatment was completed, the pH was 10. The solids were washed, neutralized with carbon dioxide, and allowed to air dry before use."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The concentration of carboxylic acids were measured as described previously (Agbogbo and Holtzapple, 2007). Gases produced during the fermentation were accumulated within the fermentor. The volume of gas produced was measured and analyzed using an Agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 4.6-m packed column with 2.1-mm ID (60/80 Carboxen 100, Supelco 1-2390). Samples were injected manually. The inlet temperature was 230°C, the detector temperature was 250°C and the oven temperature was ramped from 55 to 225°C, at 20°C/min rate, where it was held at 225°C for 1min. Helium was used as a carrier gas and the total run time per sample was 11min. Determination of hexose and pentose sugars and volatile solids (VS) composition of both the fresh substrate and fermentation residue was performed following NREL standard procedures (2004)."
5,Lignocellulosic mixed-acid fermentation procedures,"2.4 Lignocellulosic mixed-acid fermentation procedures Batch fermentation was performed at 55°C for 36days as previously described (Forrest et al., 2010), with the following modifications: To determine the reproducibility of the batch experiments, each substrate was fermented in three fermentors operated simultaneously under identical conditions. Countercurrent fermentations were initiated as batch fermentations (∼10days) using inoculum taken from the previous batch fermentation of the same substrate. The liquids and solids were transferred every 2days in countercurrent directions. At each transfer, the produced gas was vented and measured, and the solids and liquids were separated by centrifugation. The product liquid was analyzed for carboxylic acid and VS, the spent solids were collected for VS analysis and sugar analysis. Fresh biomass and fresh liquid were added. A constant wet cake of predetermined weight was maintained in each fermentor to achieve steady-state conditions. Once the transfer was completed, iodoform was added, and the pH was measured and adjusted to 7.0 with ammonium bicarbonate. Then the fermentors were purged with nitrogen, closed, and placed back in the incubator. Steady-state conditions were evidenced when a consistent acid concentration was produced for at least 2weeks in a row."
6,Theory and calculations,"Agricultural residues are composed of three main components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Although cellulose and hemicelluloses contain several types of sugars, the microbial pathways are generalized to hexose and pentose digestion. Pentose- and hexose-specific isomerases efficiently interconvert their target sugars, facilitating entry into metabolic pathways for energy conversion. Within all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic, glycolysis is the primary metabolic pathway, which converts glucose into pyruvate. Pentose digestion begins when pentose (e.g., xylose) enters the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, which converts five-carbon sugars into chemicals that can enter glycolysis. During the non-oxidative phase, three pentoses are converted into two fructose-6-phosphates and one glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate that enter into glycolysis and are converted into pyruvate. Fermentations are typically distinguished by the pathway end-products. For example, lactic acid fermentations reduce pyruvate into lactate. Similarly, alcohol fermentations reduce pyruvate to ethanol and carbon dioxide. This study focuses on mixed-acid fermentation using a mixed culture of bacteria to produce acetic and propionic acid and carbon dioxide, which can then enter fatty acid synthesis to form higher acids (i.e., butyric, valeric, caproic, and heptanoic). Microorganisms use catabolic reactions to fuel anabolic reactions ( Δ G T = Δ G C - Δ G A ) , with the resulting net Gibbs free energy change approaching zero ( Δ G T ≅ 0 ) (Henry et al., 2006). The standard Gibbs free energy change of a reaction ( Δ G R ° ) is calculated by summing the standard Gibbs free energies of formation ( Δ G R ° = ∑ v i Δ G F ° ) , where v is the stoichiometric number of Reactant i. The standard enthalpies of reaction ( Δ H R ° ) are calculated in the same way. Table 1 shows the Gibbs free energies of reaction for selected cellular reactions of hexose, pentose, and NADH. The type of sugar being digested, the type of acids produced, and hydrogen production affect the Gibbs free energy. The total Gibbs free energy (kJ) released from catabolic reactions by the specific production of each type of acid and hydrogen can be calculated by Eq. (1). (1) Δ G C = ∑ j Acid j × ∑ i ( χ i × Δ G ji ) + H 2 × Δ G H 2 Δ G C is the total Gibbs free energy change from catabolic reactions (kJ), Acid j is the carboxylic acid of Type j (mol), χi is the mol fraction of sugar of Type i (e.g., mol hexose/mol total sugars), Δ G ji is the Gibbs free energy of reaction for Type j acid from Type i sugar (kJ/mol), H2 is hydrogen produced (mol), and Δ G H 2 is the Gibbs free energy of reaction for hydrogen (kJ/mol). For any given system of substrate, buffer, and incubation temperature, the microorganisms adjust the spectrum of products ( Δ G C ) to match the needed Δ G A . Therefore, the energy selectivity (γ, kJ/g) of a system is described by Eq. (2). (2) γ ≡ Δ G C Δ VS Once γ has been determined for a system, hydrogen production can be predicted by combining Eqs. (1) and (2) and solving for H2 (Eq. (3)). (3) H 2 = γ × ( Δ VS ) - ∑ j Acid j × ∑ i ( χ i × Δ G ji ) Δ G H 2 A more detailed discussion of the microbial pathways and the Gibbs calculations is available in Forrest (2010)."
7,Results and discussion,"After 36days, the paper (PH) and bagasse (BH) batch fermentations were similar in total acid concentration, conversion and carboxylic acid productivity, but had distinctly different hydrogen selectivity (Table 2 ). Based on the carboxylic acids produced and sugars digested, the PH batch fermentation had an energy selectivity of −2.11±0.011kJ/g VS digested whereas the BH batch fermentation had an energy selectivity of −2.00±0.016kJ/g VS digested. Continuous countercurrent fermentations of both paper (PHC) and bagasse (BHC) ran for 206days. Tables 3 and 4 show the operating parameters and the results for these fermentations. When shifting to continuous operation, the hydrogen production dropped in the paper fermentation, but not in the bagasse fermentation. In the paper fermentations, the only significant change was that the percentage of acetic acid increased from 70% in the batch fermentation to 83% in the continuous fermentation. In contrast, the acetic acid percentage stayed roughly constant in the bagasse fermentations. Considering the microbial pathways, the increase in the percentage of acetic acid in the paper fermentations, which would result in a higher yield of NADH, should have resulted in an increased hydrogen production, however, it did not. These results emphasize that hydrogen is a secondary byproduct, and is produced only when there is an excess of NADH. During the continuous fermentations, to maintain a Δ G T close to zero, the paper fermentation used more of the NADH, leaving less to be converted into hydrogen. Using the energy selectivities determined during the batch fermentations, the actual carboxylic acids produced and the sugars digested during the continuous fermentations (Tables 2 and 4), the paper continuous fermentation (PHC) was predicted to produce 41.6±7.9mLH2/day with a hydrogen selectivity of 17.8mLH2/g VS digested whereas the bagasse continuous fermentation should have produced 111.4±10.6mLH2/day with a hydrogen selectivity of 52.1mLH2/g VS digested. The results for paper fermentation were successfully predicted using the thermodynamic analysis, whereas the outcome for the bagasse fermentation was less predictive. The actual PHC hydrogen production (36.8mLH2/day) is within the standard deviation predicted by the energy selectivities but the actual BHC hydrogen production (88.0mLH2/day) is just outside the predicted values. When compared to the experimental data, this gives an error of 11.5% for PHC H2 production and a 21% error for BHC H2 production. In both cases, the prediction is high compared to the experimental data indicating that rather than releasing the reducing power of the NADH as H2 gas, it must be used in other ways. This study proposes a simple mathematical formula that predicts hydrogen production from mixed-acid fermentations within 21% of the experimental data. Given the complexity of the system (mixed feedstock, mixed microbial cultures, mixed products), it is remarkable that such a simple formulation had this predictive ability. The current formulation is sufficient to approximately predict hydrogen production from the measured consumption of sugars and production of volatile fatty acids. Future refinements of the model should include the contributions of minor volatile acids (e.g., formic, octanoic), other products (e.g., lactic, pyruvic acid, ethanol), and metabolism of other substrate components (e.g., proteins, fats)."
8,Conclusions,"Hydrogen gas was collected and quantified from mixed-acid fermentations of paper and sugarcane bagasse. During batch fermentations, energy selectivity was measured and then applied to continuous fermentations. This thermodynamic analysis more accurately predicted the hydrogen yield of the paper fermentations (11.5% error) but was less predictive for the bagasse fermentations (21% error). It is anticipated that including a broader range of products (e.g., pyruvic acid) and reactants (e.g., fats) will increase the prediction’s accuracy. Nonetheless, in its current simplified form, the model has reasonable predictive ability and can be used to guide process design in industrial and energy applications."
