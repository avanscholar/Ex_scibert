0,Introduction,"Efficient purification and compression of hydrogen for energy storage and subsequent usage in H2 Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) remains a present-day challenge [1,2], as the movement towards decarbonisation of the energy and transport sectors is underway [3]. The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking targets 5.6 million fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and hybrid FCEVs by 2030, requiring approximately 3700 refuelling stations [2] in the European Union. The hydrogen available at refuelling stations will need to meet ISO standards (ISO 14687–2019) [4] and pressurised to 850–1000 bar or higher in order to refuel a FCEV at 700 bar [5] in 3 min [6]. Steam Methane Reforming (SMR, shown in Eq. (1)) and Autothermal Reforming (ATR, shown in Eq. (2)) are currently the predominant methods of hydrogen production, forming 70% of the total hydrogen production in the EU in 2015, the remaining 30% was formed as a byproduct from the chemical industry [2]. SMR is the process by which methane is reacted with water, in the form of steam, to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide at 3–25 bar [7], SMR is often coupled to a Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor to oxidise CO to CO2 and produce more H2 by Eq. (3). ATR involves the partial combustion of methane with oxygen to hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of steam at 20–100 bar [8]. Moreover, sulphide containing compounds are present in natural gas and are removed prior to SMR and ATR to <50 ppb [9]. Eq. 1 Steam Methane Reforming C H 4 + H 2 O ⇌ C O + 3 H 2 Eq. 2 Autothermal Reforming 4 C H 4 + O 2 + 2 H 2 O ⇌ 4 C O + 10 H 2 Eq. 3 Water Gas Shift C O + H 2 O ⇌ C O 2 + H 2 Therefore, hydrogen produced via SMR and ATR require purification, in order to reach the ISO standard of 0.2 ppm CO, 2 ppm CO2, 100 ppm CH4 and 4 ppb H2S [4], followed by compression to 850–1000 bar to meet refuelling station specifications. Current purification of hydrogen is achieved by pressure swing absorption which, if designed to separate CO, can achieve the ISO standard for CO, CO2 and CH4 [9]. The probability of failing to meet the ISO standards using the pressure swing adsorption method is unlikely for CH4, rare for CO2 but frequent for CO [9]. The compression of hydrogen is then completed by adiabatic mechanical compression [10], however, this compression method is energy intensive [11–13]. The compression of hydrogen can be achieved electrochemically, using the so-called Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump (EHP) or electrochemical hydrogen compression system. This isothermal compression process is demonstrably more efficient than mechanical compression, with an energy requirement to compress H2 to 1000 bar of ~4 kWh/kgH2 compared to 6.6 kWh/kgH2 for mechanical compression [11]. Additionally, the EHP system purifies H2 by reducing CO2 impurities by 5000 fold and CO impurities by 1000 fold [14], although further work is needed to validate the operation of EHP systems to meet ISO standards and to determine the operation current densities with different H2 feed impurities. The anode reaction in EHP systems is the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR, shown in Eq. (4)) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, shown in Eq. (5)), on the cathode. The anode and cathode are separated by a proton conducting electrolyte. Eq. 4 Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction H 2 ⇌ 2 H + + 2 e − Eq. 5 Hydrogen Evolution Reaction 2 H + + 2 e − ⇌ H 2 Protons are transferred through the membrane from the anode to the cathode via the same mechanism as described for Hydrogen PEMFCs [15–17], as the EHP operates with proton conducting membranes. Protons are subsequently reduced at the cathode, which becomes pressurised at the desired output pressure, to form compressed hydrogen. Hence the EHP system acts as an electrolytic concentration cell [18]. Since the membrane is proton-selective, the majority of the impurities in the hydrogen feed to the anode are not present in the compressed hydrogen product at the cathode, although small amounts may diffuse through the membrane [14]. One challenge that arises from operating an EHP with impurities such as CO or H2S, is the poisoning of the anode catalysts, typically Pt or PtRu, in the same manner as in PEMFCs. The use of CO poison tolerant catalysts, such as PtRu, allows for some CO in the feed, but this is still limited to low concentrations of <10 ppm CO [19] in the case of H2 PEMFC operation. One mechanism for poison mitigation in PEMFCs is from small concentrations of O2 in the anode, provided by O2 crossover from the cathode or explicitly added as an O2 bleed into the fuel stream [20–22]. O2 at the anode assists in heterogeneous oxidation of CO, a process which proceeds via the mechanism detailed in Eqs. (6)–(8) [21]. An O2 bleed is effective in mitigating poisoning in PEMFCs for <100 ppm CO [21,23,24], however care must be taken to avoid producing a mixture which is flammable/explosive, and also adequate mixing of the oxidant is required in order to reduce overheating problems at the anode [25]. Moreover, an O2 bleed has also been reported for H2S, however it was only partially effective [26]. Previous work by Kakati and Kucernak [27,28], demonstrated the use of ozone to remove sulphur poisoning via chemical oxidation of H2S from the Pt anode catalyst in a H2 PEMFC via Eqs. (9)–(16). This process relies either on direct action of oxygen or ozone itself, or one of the highly active reactive oxygen species formed when ozone decomposes in water, such as the oxygen ( O ⋅ ), hydroxyl ( H O ⋅ ) and perhydroxyl ( H O O ⋅ ) radicals [29,30]. Eq. 6 O 2 + 2 P t ⇌ P t − O 2 + P t ⇒ 2 ( O − P t ) Eq. 7 P t + C O ⇌ P t − C O Eq. 8 P t − C O + O − P t ⇌ C O 2 + 2 P t Eq. 9 P t + H 2 S ⇌ P t − H 2 S a d s Eq. 10 P t − H 2 S a d s ⇌ P t − S + H 2 Eq. 11 O 3 ⇌ O 2 + O ⋅ Eq. 12 O ⋅ + H 2 O ⇌ 2 H O ⋅ Eq. 13 H O ⋅ + O 3 ⇌ H O O ⋅ + O 2 Eq. 14 P t − S + O 2 ⇌ P t + S O 2 Eq. 15 P t − S + 2 [ O ] ⇌ P t + S O 2 Eq. 16 P t − S + O 3 ⇌ P t − O + S O 2 where [ O ] is one of the reactive oxygen species produced when ozone decomposes in water [29,30] (Eqs. (11)–(13)). Investigations into the effect of CO and CO2 on the EHP have been reported [31–37], however, limited work on poison mitigation in an EHP has been studied [31], using an air bleed. Moreover, the effect of H2S as a poison on an EHP has not yet been analysed. In this paper, the operation of the EHP with different poisons is investigated, first the effect of 20 ppm CO using two different anode catalysts, Pt and PtRu. Our previous work [38] also detailed the rate of poisoning of these EHPs and made a comparison to ex-situ testing. The second gas considered is comparable to the H2 product stream from a SMR-WGS reactor (feed composition of 78.6% H2, 18.5% CO2, 2.9% CH4 and 20 ppm CO) and thirdly the effect of H2S (100 ppb, 1 ppm and 5 ppm in H2 and 100 ppb in the SMR-WGS H2 feed) was investigated. Two different poison mitigation strategies were studied, “online” and “offline” regeneration. Online regeneration is in the form of bleeds in the H2 feed, consisting of 1.2% O2 and 1.15% O2+0.05% O3, the effect of the ozone addition to the bleed was examined at different EHP cell voltages (100 and 200 mV). Additionally, offline regeneration of the anode with O2 and O2+~4% O3 was studied. Offline regeneration consists of purging the cell with N2, followed by O2 or O2+~4% O3 and finally purging with N2 again while in potentiostatic mode. Lastly, the regeneration strategies were validated in a second system, the H2 PEMFC. Online regeneration is the most important strategy as it defines the efficiency of the EHP or PEMFC when operating with impure H2 feeds, the offline regeneration is of interest for periodic servicing or emergency protocols, when the anode is severely poisoned and requires fast regeneration."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup Hydrogen and oxygen/air, at certain concentrations, will form explosive mixtures. In hydrogen-oxygen mixtures, the explosive limits are 3.8–4.6% (lower explosive limit) to 94.6–95.4% (upper explosive limit) of O2 in H2 between 20 and 80 °C and 1–5 bar [39]. For further information, see supplementary section on explosive limits. The experimental flow diagram is described in Fig. 1 . During the O2 and O3/O2 bleeds, the MFC-1 and MFC-2 were operated in leader/follower configuration as a safety precaution. Therefore, if the H2 flowrate was impeded, as the O2/O3 flowrate was tethered to the H2 feed it would also decrease to maintain the flow composition. If MFC-1 were to fail open, it has been chosen so that the maximum output flow is 5 mL min−1 which would result in a maximum composition of 2.5% in 200 mL min−1 of H2. MFC-3 is used for offline regeneration, with an operation flowrate of 50 mL min−1. A single 5 cm2 (Dual Area Cell Fixture, Scribner Associates Inc.) cell is used. See supplementary section on ozone generation."
3,Electrode preparation,"2.2 Electrode preparation As received 47.8% Pt/C TKK TEC10E50E (Tanaka Kininzoku Kogyo) and 54% PtRu/C (Pt:Ru ratio of 1:1.5) TKK TEC61E54 catalysts were used and the catalysts loadings are as described in Table 1 . Electrodes were prepared by screen printing an ink containing an alcohol/water mixture, the Pt/C or PtRu/C catalyst and a Nafion™ ionomer dispersion (D2020) on SGL Carbon Sigracet 28BC™. Typical 7-layer MEAs (5 cm2) have been prepared by hot laminating between two ptfe coated laminating plates (T = 137 °C; 2 min; 11 N/mm2) a 50 μm thick Nafion 212™ PEM sandwiched between two gas diffusion electrodes. MEAs are described as Pt/Pt for Pt/C on the anode and Pt/C on the cathode, while PtRu/Pt MEAs refer to PtRu/C on the anode and Pt/C on the cathode. These MEAs were used as both EHP and Fuel Cell MEAs."
4,EHP and fuel cell electrochemical characterisation,"2.3 EHP and fuel cell electrochemical characterisation MEAs were pre-conditioned using the humidification and break-in protocols defined in the 2009 DOE protocol for single cell MEA testing [40]. Chronoamperometry was measured at iR-free cell voltages of 100 mV and 200 mV and a cell temperature of 35 °C with 75% RH H2 pure and mixed feeds (Air Products Ltd.) to the anode at a total flowrate of 200 mL min−1. The cell voltage was corrected for cell resistance during the measurements, determined using current interrupt for 40 μs every 2 s. The EHP system was operated at atmospheric pressure on the anode and cathode. The electrochemical response was measured using a Gamry potentiostat (Reference 3000) with a booster (30 K Booster). 2.3.1 EHP polarisation curves These were obtained by holding the cell voltage at each point for 5 min with a cell temperature of 35 °C and using pure H2 to the anode at a flowrate of 200 mL min−1 and RH of 75%, the polarisation curve was iR corrected after testing, using current interrupt at 100 mV and 200 mV. These resulted in an iR of 47.7 ± 1.1 and 41.7 ± 0.1 mOhm.cm2 for the Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs respectively. The maximum theoretical hydrogen efficiency of the EHP system may be calculated by using the flowrate of 200 mL min−1 H2, the Faraday constant (96 485.33 C mol−1), assuming a two electron reaction (for H2) and the ideal gas law. Thus, the maximum theoretical current density was calculated to be 5.3 A cm−2. 2.3.2 EHP online regeneration Bleeds of 1.2% O2 and 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 were used. The average current density used to plot the comparison graphs between different gas compositions were 1.04 ± 0.01 A cm−2 for the Pt/Pt MEAs (3 experiments) and 1.03 ± 0.14 A cm−2 for the PtRu/Pt MEAs (26 experiments) measured for all experiments at 100 mV. The average current densities measured at 200 mV were 1.59 ± 0.04 A cm−2 for the Pt/Pt MEAs (3 experiments) and 1.46 ± 0.12 A cm−2 for the PtRu/Pt MEAs (28 experiments). 2.3.3 EHP offline regeneration The EHP was purged at 200 mL min−1 with N2 for 2 min before and after O2 (or O2+~4% O3) purging at 50 mL min−1 for 1, 5, 15 and 20 min, thus, the total offline times were 5, 9, 19 and 24 min, respectively. 2.3.4 Fuel cell online regeneration A bleed of 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 was used. The average current density used to plot the comparison graphs between different H2 feeds was 1.11 ± 0.06 A cm−2 for PtRu/Pt MEAs (2 experiments) measured at 550 mV. 2.3.5 Fuel cell offline regeneration The cell voltage was set to 200 mV, purged with N2 for 2 min on the anode (200 mL min−1) before and after the O2+~4% O3 offline regeneration at 50 mL min−1 for 20 min, thus, the total offline time was 24 min. N2 was purged on the cathode (200 mL min−1) for the duration of the offline regeneration. 2.3.6 Electrochemical modelling The transient responses from poisoning were fitted using Eq. (17) in Excel, solving for the parameters n , k and j m i n . This equation was previously described by the authors [38], based on the Langmuir-Hill isotherm which took into consideration the complex nature of COad absorption over time, by allowing the number of sites blocked or influenced by the adsorbate to be non-integer and greater than one. In this case, a simplified version in which the poisoning process is presumed to start at t = 0 was utilised. Generalised Reduced Gradient (GDG) non-linear solver with Multistart and a population of 100 was used to fit the experimental data with the function, as previously described in Kucernak and Zalitis for HOR [41]. GDG non-linear solver with Multistart determines the global minimum statistically by randomly sampling the result using a large population of starting parameters. Eq. 17 j j m a x = j m i n j m a x + ( 1 − j m i n j m a x ) 1 1 + ( k t ) n where j (A cm−2) is the measured current, and j m a x and j m i n (both A cm−2) are the maximum (initial) and minimum (long-term extrapolation) currents, t (s) is time, n is related to the average number of free platinum sites affected by the poisoning molecule and k (s) is the length of time required for the current to fall halfway to its ultimate value [38]. For a given catalyst, poison and applied potential, the same value of n was expected, and so all three transients (no bleed, O2 bleed, and O2/O3 bleed) were fit simultaneously using a common value of n , but independent values of k and j m i n . The common value of n was fit to reduce the number of parameters fitted, and hence reduce the likelihood of over parameterization. A characteristic time associated with poisoning all the available platinum sites on the anode was defined as τ p o i s o n , associated with the mass flow of poison into the EHP. Eq. 18 τ p o i s o n = Γ c a t a l y s t S A c a t a l y s t L c a t a l y s t A e l e c t r o d e V f u e l c p o i s o n where Γ c a t a l y s t (mol.m−2) are the number of adsorption sites per area of catalyst, S A c a t a l y s t (m2.g−1), the specific surface area of the catalyst, L c a t a l y s t (g.m−2) is the catalyst loading on the electrode used, and A e l e c t r o d e (m2) is the area of the electrode in the cell. V f u e l and c p o i s o n are the volumetric flow rate of fuel into the cell (m3.s−1) and the concentration of the respective poison in that gas feed (mol m−3)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Polarisation curves,"3.1 Polarisation curves The EHP polarisation curves for the Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs are shown in Fig. 2 . These polarisation curves show a plateau at cell voltages of ~300 mV at ~2 A cm−2 for both MEAs, which corresponds to a hydrogen pumping efficiency of 37–40% (i.e. proportion of the inlet hydrogen is transferred across the membrane, Eq. (19), where = 5.3 A cm−2). Ströbel et al. [12] reported polarisation curves for a number of different commercial MEAs at 25 °C which achieved current densities between ~0.12–0.5 A cm−2 at 200 mV. The wide range of current densities was attributed to mass transport and iR differences between the MEAs. As noted in our previous publication, the capabilities of the Pt and PtRu catalysts when measured ex-situ under high mass transport conditions, are ~70 A.mg-1 metal at 200 mV. This mass activity translates into a maximum prospective current density of 11.9–21.4 A cm−2 for the MEAs used in this study, assuming the HOR/anode is the limiting reaction. Thus, mass transport limitations are prevalent here, as also reported by Ströbel et al. [12]. Chronoamperometry was performed on the different MEAs and the average current densities at 100 and 200 mV are reported in Table 2 , along with the hydrogen efficiency. As explained above, the mass transport limitations or diffusion limitations of the MEAs reduce the current density and thus the hydrogen efficiency of the system. However, similar current densities at 100 and 200 mV are measured on the Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs. Eq. 19 F u e l E f f i c i e n c y = i i t h e o r e t i c a l , m a x"
7,Online potentiostatic recovery,"3.2 Online potentiostatic recovery 3.2.1 H2 feed with 20 ppm CO The effects of different catalysts at the anode (Pt and PtRu), the presence of an oxygen or oxygen + ozone bleed, and the cell voltage (100 and 200 mV) when operating with H2+20 ppm CO are displayed in Fig. 3 with the derived parameters from the fitting results are shown in Table 3 . Considering the responses in the absence of any O2/O2+O3 bleed. Firstly, the PtRu anode catalyst was significantly more poison tolerant than the Pt catalyst, since the PtRu catalyst took ~2600 s to lose 50% of its original current density while the Pt catalyst took less than 500 s ( k values from Table 3), a time similar to the τ p o i s o n value (~570 s). The τ poison value represents the time required to poison all the catalyst sites, assuming all the poison flowing into the cell is adsorbed and none is oxidised. This similarity suggests that in the case of Pt, little CO is oxidised, and the majority is adsorbed. In contrast, the larger k value of PtRu suggests it has some degree of CO tolerance, which is already well documented in literature, where the poison tolerance mechanism is through the bifunctional mechanism and/or the ‘ligand effect’ [42–50]. However, for both Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt, the fit suggests that the extrapolated long term “steady-state” performance is zero at the cell operating temperature (Fig. 6 and Table S1). Next, the positive effect of the oxygen bleed on the current density is clearly seen on both the Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs. On the Pt/Pt MEAs at 100 mV, the long term extrapolated performance ( j m i n j m a x ) , increases from 0% to 29.3% after including a 1.2% O2 bleed, and further increases to 41.0% when using a 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed (Fig. 6 and Table S1). This O2 effect is also seen in H2 PEMFCs from O2 crossover from the cathode or an O2 bleed to aid in the CO tolerance of the anode catalysts [21,23,24] via heterogeneous oxidation of CO, Eqs. (6)–(8) [21]. The inclusion of 0.05% of ozone, a strong oxidising agent, further reduces the rate of poisoning on the Pt/Pt MEAs, via either a heterogeneous direct process, such as Eq. (20), or via the highly reactive oxygen species ( [ O ] , see Eqs. (11)–(13)), shown in Eq. (21). When the voltage is increased to 200 mV, the effect of the bleed is increased. At 200 mV the j m i n increases from 0% to 72.7% after including a 1.2% O2 bleed, and a further increase to 73.6% when using a 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed. This indicates that the CO tolerance also follows an electrochemical reaction, since increasing the voltage has accelerated the oxidation reaction, the reaction is proposed as Eqs. (22) & (24) [51]. Eq. 20 P t − C O + O 3 ⇌ P t + C O 2 + O 2 Eq. 21 P t − C O + [ O ] ⇌ P t − O + C O 2 Eq. 22 P t + H 2 O ⇌ P t − O H + H + + e − Eq. 23 R u + H 2 O ⇌ R u − O H + H + + e − Eq. 24 P t − C O + P t / R u − O H ⇌ 2 P t + C O 2 + H + + e − Due to its intrinsic CO tolerance, the PtRu/Pt MEAs show higher current densities than the Pt/Pt MEAs when using the 1.2% O2 bleed and the 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed at both 100 mV and 200 mV. When using bleeds, j m i n j m a x lies in the range 88–91% (Fig. 6C & D) for both sets of bleeds at both voltages. On the PtRu anode catalyst, the CO oxidation mechanism of chemical or electrochemical reactions cannot be identified as all current densities are high and little difference is observed between 100 and 200 mV or by use of 0.05% O3 in the bleed. Table 3 details the parameters from the electrochemical modelling of the transient responses from poisoning the Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs with 20 ppm CO. Here, the n value, which represents the number of Pt sites affected by poisoning, is slightly lower on the PtRu catalyst (1.5) compared to the Pt catalyst (1.8–2.1). This trend is also seen when fitting the transients using the ex-situ ‘floating electrode’ catalyst characterisation technique [38], although larger values of n are observed when using the EHP. The k (in seconds) is the length of time required for the current to fall halfway to its ultimate value of j m i n , this may be compared to τ p o i s o n which is the time to form a monolayer of CO. k on the Pt/Pt MEA when no bleed is used is 420–470 s, where τ p o i s o n 2 = 283 s, while k on the PtRu/Pt MEA when no bleed is used is 2610–2280 s, where τ p o i s o n 2 = 295 s. When k is significantly larger than τ p o i s o n 2 , this indicates that the catalyst is CO tolerant, as the measured rate of poisoning is lower than the theoretical rate if all CO entering the EHP is adsorbed and catalyst sites are blocked. Hence the Pt/Pt MEAs show some CO tolerance, however, k on the PtRu/Pt MEAs is almost 10-fold larger than τ p o i s o n 2 . Lastly, the values for k when using a O2 or O2/O3 bleed are shorter than with no bleed. This suggests that when a bleed is used, a dynamic equilibrium between the poison and the bleed species is established relatively quickly at the catalyst surface. 3.2.2 H2 feed from SMR-WGS The hydrogen feed investigated here is the SMR-WGS H2 feed, assuming that the CO component of the SMR-WGS feed dictates the poisoning rate, τ p o i s o n = 589s. A comparison between the H2+20 ppm CO feed and SMR-WGS H2 for the case of PtRu/Pt MEAs at 200 mV is made in Fig. 4A. This figure shows that in the absence of an oxygen bleed, the rate of poisoning is faster with the SMR-WGS H2 feed than with the H2+20 ppm CO feed. The best-fit parameters used for the model fits (Table 4 ) also confirm this impression, although because of a slow oscillation in some of the results, the fitting values may be prone to a small amount of error. The extrapolated steady state performance when using the SMR-WGS feed (Fig. 6) is close to zero, also seen for the H2+20 ppm CO values. The lower value of k , 1620–1920s with SMR-WGS H2 (Table 4), compared to 2280–2610s with H2+20 ppm CO (Table 3) and the slight increase of 0.2 in the value of n indicate that the PtRu/Pt MEA poisons faster when using the SMR-WGS H2 feed. Even when a bleed is used, the difference in performance between SMR-WGS H2 and H2+20 ppm CO remains. This faster rate of poisoning and lower current could be due to three phenomena, the first being CO2 undergoing the electrochemical reverse water gas shift reaction (ERWGS, Eq. (25)) [31,52] at the anode or CO2 crossover from the anode to the cathode and subsequent reduction via the ERGWS reaction at the cathode. The third phenomena involves CH4, which are unlikely reactions. Methane at the anode may undergo electro-oxidation (Eq. (26)) [53,54], heterogenous reaction with water (SMR, Eq. (1)) or catalytic conversion with O2, although usually methane is considered a diluent in the anode feed to PEMFCs. ERWGS (and indirectly Eq. (26)) form CO, which could further poison the anode and cathode catalysts, thus the rate of poisoning is faster when using the SMR-WGS H2 feed than when simply using H2+20 ppm CO. Eq. 25 C O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − ⇌ C O + H 2 O E 0 = − 0.061 V Eq. 26 C H 4 + 2 H 2 O ⇌ C O 2 + 8 H + + 8 e − E 0 = 0.169 V The addition of the 1.2% O2 bleed results in an improvement to the steady-state current density at 100 mV (Figs. 4B and 6) from 2.6% (without a bleed) to 48.5%. This indicates that oxidation of the CO is occurring. Previously, when using H2+20 ppm CO as a fuel with PtRu/Pt electrodes, no benefit in changing the bleed from 1.2% O2 to 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 was observed. In contrast, when using the SMR-WGS feed, there is a significant further improvement when ozone was included in the bleed. At 100 mV, after including a 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed, the long-term steady-state current density increases from 48.5% (~0.5 A cm−2 with the 1.2% O2 bleed) to 59.7% with the 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed (~0.6 A cm−2), indicating the oxidation of CO with O3 (via Eqs. (20) and (21)). As noted for the O2 and O2/O3 bleed with H2+20 ppm CO, the k values are lower when using the bleeds as equilibration is faster than when the system does not have a bleed. An increase in cell voltage from 100 to 200 mV also affects the current density and efficacy of the O2 and O3/O2 bleeds when using the SMR-WGS H2 feed with PtRu/Pt MEAs. An increase of 17.7% (to ~1 A cm−2) using the 1.2% O2 bleed and 12.9% in current density (to ~1.1 A cm−2) is observed using the 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed when the cell voltage is increased from 100 to 200 mV. This voltage dependence on the poison tolerance indicates involvement of electrochemical oxidation in the oxidation of CO from the PtRu surface. It might also be associated with the reduced overpotential available for CO2 reduction associated with Eq. (25). This voltage dependence was previously reported [31] in EHP testing with CO2 without a bleed, as the voltage is increased, the amount of poisoning of the EHP is decreased, promoting the hypothesis of an electro-oxidation of CO. In Fig. 4C the bleed of 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 retains the highest j m i n j m a x of ~73% at 200 mV when using the SMR-WGS H2 feed. The 1.2% O2 bleed also retains a high current density, however this result is unstable and changes with time, shown by a decrease to ~60% at 12000s. This instability in current density when using the 1.2% O2 bleed is also seen in Fig. 4B at 100 mV, where the addition of O3 to the bleed allows for more stable current densities. Previous work [55–58] on chronopotentiometry with reformate gas to the anode of a H2 PEMFC, using a PtRu anode catalyst, has shown oscillations in the measured voltage suggested as due to the coupling of Pt–CO and Ru–OH on the PtRu surface. After the introduction of CO, the CO will block active catalyst sites and the voltage will rise in order to maintain a constant current. At a specific voltage, the electro-oxidation of CO exceeds the rate of poisoning and the voltage drops [58]. This is not the case for chronoamperometry, as the voltage remains constant. Instability in the current during chronoamperometry is likely also due to the dynamic relationship between surface coverage, heterogeneous CO oxidation and electro-oxidation of CO, however, it is not as clear as in chronopotentiometry, since there are no voltage excursions to accelerate the electro-oxidation of CO. 3.2.3 H2 feed with H2S The effect of 100 ppb and 1 ppm (1000 ppb) H2S was investigated. H2S is a well-known poison for Pt and PtRu catalysts at the anode of H2 PEMFC via the Eqs. (9) and (10), although this poison has not yet been investigated in an EHP. Under the conditions of our experiments, the characteristic time to cover all the catalyst (assuming a 1:1 Pt:S ratio) of τ p o i s o n = 1.2 × 105 s (32.7 h) for 100 ppb H2S and 1.2 × 104 s (3.3 h) for 1 ppm H2S. As seen in Fig. 5, the introduction of 100 ppb H2S causes a ~15% reduction (to ~0.88 A cm−2 at 100 mV and 1.2 A cm−2 at 200 mV) and 1 ppm H2S causes a ~85–100% reduction (to ~0.15 A cm−2 at 100 mV and 0.03 A cm−2 at 200 mV) in the estimated steady state EHP performance. As seen in Fig. 5, this 15% reduction in current density using the 100 ppb H2S is seen in the first 15000–20000s (~4–5 h), and this is in line with τ p o i s o n as all of the H2S entering the system is absorbed (one Sad affects one hydrogen site). When the concentration of H2S is increased to 1 ppm, the time taken to lose 50% of the current density is k = 6870 and 17500s for applied cell potentials of 100 mV and 200 mV, respectively (~3–4 h, seen in Fig. 5). After this period of time ~60–100% of catalyst sites are expected to have Sad adsorbed if all S entering the EHP is adsorbed on the anode. Thus, using the 1 ppm H2S, one Sad atom affects 0.6–1 hydrogen adsorption sites. The electrochemical model fit parameters are shown in Table 5 , these also indicate that more Pt sites are involved in the poisoning with 100 ppb H2S, since n is 2-3x larger (to values of 3.1–4.7) when compared to CO ( n = 1.5 ), while a small increase in n is observed when using 1 ppm H2S to 2–2.1. This follows previous research showing that Sad may affect numerous hydrogen adsorption sites, due to a coadsorption model, where the Sad atom blocks the nearest neighbours for hydrogen adsorption [59], or beyond the nearest neighbours due to the electrostatic effects from a dipole moment formed from an electron transfer from Pt to S [60]. This effect is only seen for low coverages [59] of Sad, at high coverages the number of Pt sites affected per Sad atom is decreased. Thus, the model does appear to follow the underlying chemistry since proportionately fewer Pt or PtRu sites for hydrogen are affected at higher concentrations of H2S. In the case of 100 ppb H2S, the 1.2% O2 and 1.15% + 0.05% O3 bleeds retain over 97% of the current at 100 and 200 mV, this retained current is akin to the current measured without H2S (Fig. 5 and Table S1). Therefore it can be seen that both bleeds are effective in oxidising the H2S (Eqs. (14)–(16) [26]). As noted for the O2 and O2/O3 bleed with H2+20 ppm CO and SMR-WGS H2, the k values are lower when using the bleeds with 100 ppb H2S, as equilibration is faster at higher current densities than when the system does not have a bleed. Eq. 27 P t − S + 2 ( O − P t ) ⇌ S O 2 + 3 P t Eq. 28 P t − S + 2 P t R u − O H ⇌ P t + 2 P t R u + S O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − When the H2S concentration is increased to 1 ppm, the efficacy of the O2 bleed is reduced. The retained j m i n j m a x is 14.5% and 0% at 100 and 200 mV, respectively. Moreover, the current when using the 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed increases to 58.6 and 15.8% for cell voltages of 100 and 200 mV, respectively, however this ( j m i n j m a x ) would take many hours to reach, as k is 40 000–115 000s (11–32 h), and a reduction to only 96% is seen after 7 h of operation. The values of k in the case of 1 ppm H2S are considerably longer when using a O2 or O2/O3 bleed versus no bleed, especially for the O2/O3 bleed, since the change in current density is slower. Thus, the effect of ozone as a strong oxidant is observed and a voltage dependence on the H2S tolerance is also seen, since the current retained at higher voltages is higher, indicating electro-oxidation of adsorbed sulphur (directly, or indirectly as proposed in Eqs. (27) and (28)). This result of decreased O2 bleed efficacy under high H2S concentrations was expected, as previous work on 8 ppm H2S with a 5% air bleed (equivalent to 1% O2 bleed) showed minimal changes to the rate of poisoning in a H2 PEMFC [26]. The effectiveness of ozone as an oxidant for removing H2S poisoning in fuel cells was investigated by Kakati and Kucernak [27]. Their study involved an offline regeneration mode which reported removal of H2S from the catalyst surface after 600s by heterogeneous oxidation of adsorbed sulphur by O3 in O2 with the fuel cell not connected to a load. Under these conditions the ozone reduction reaction pulls the OCV of the anode to 1.6 V assisting in electrochemical oxidation of adsorbed sulphur during the ozone regeneration. 3.2.4 H2 feed from SMR-WGS-H2S The final H2 mixture feed considered was the SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed, which is a possible gas composition, depending on the H2 supplier and processing conditions. The gas composition is the same as the SMR-WGS stream with the addition of 100 ppb H2S. The characteristic poisoning time, based on the CO concentration of the feed is τ p o i s o n = 589s. The rate of poisoning with this SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed is faster than with the SMR-WGS H2 feed (Fig. 6 and compare Tables 4–6 ), as j m i n j m a x is 2–5% using the SMR-WGS H2 feed but <2% is retained when using the SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed. Additionally, Table 6 reports the electrochemical modelling parameters, showing that the value of n increases to 2.3 when using the SMR-WGS-H2S when compared to SMR-WGS H2 of 1.7. Moreover, k decreases to 350–704s when using the SMR-WGS-H2S when compared to 1618–1916s when using SMR-WGS H2, both trends in n and k indicate a faster rate of poisoning when using SMR-WGS-H2S, due to the presence of H2S, which poisons Pt and PtRu catalysts. As shown above, 100 ppb H2S reduces the j m i n by ~15% and is in line with the reduction seen here between the SMR-WGS H2 and SMR-WGS-H2S H2 combinations. As with the SMR-WGS H2 feed, the presence of an O2 bleed increased the j m i n to ~0.3 A cm−2 at 100 mV, the addition of O3 further improved the current density to 0.7 A cm−2, and the bleed effect was voltage dependent (Fig. 6). After the addition of the 1.2% O2 bleed at 200 mV, the j m i n increased to 61.5%. This current of ~0.3 A cm−2 at 100 mV is lower than the current of ~0.5 A cm−2 measured using the SMR-WGS H2 feed with a 1.2% O2 bleed, thus, despite the effectiveness of the O2 bleed with 100 ppb H2S shown above, the rate of poisoning is faster after the inclusion of 100 ppb H2S to the SMR-WGS H2 feed. The O3 addition to the bleed was noticeable with the SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed at 100 and 200 mV as the current densities retained increased after the addition of 0.05% O3. As discussed above, this ozone and voltage effect are due to the electro-oxidation, as well as heterogeneous oxidation, of CO and H2S. A summary of the online regeneration results with different H2 feeds are reported in Fig. 6C–D. The responses to the different fuels show a similar response at 100 and 200 mV but note that the average current increased by about 40% when increasing the applied potential."
8,Offline potentiostatic recovery,"3.3 Offline potentiostatic recovery During the offline potentiostatic recovery mode (100 and 200 mV), the flow into the cell is stopped, N2 was first purged for 2 min, followed by the regeneration with 1 bar(abs) O2 or 1 bar(abs) ~4% O3+O2 for different times and finally N2 was purged for 2 min before the introduction of pure H2. Potentiostatic offline regeneration avoids potential excursions to high voltages under O2 or O3, which may reduce catalyst degradation during cleaning [27]. This process is meant to represent an intermittent process which can be used to treat more serious poisoning events, or be applied during servicing. A summary of the offline regeneration results with different H2 feeds are reported in Fig. 7 B. The case of poisoning with SMR-WGS-H2S at 200 mV, offline cleaning using 20 min–4% O3+O2 is shown in Fig. 7A. The other offline cleaning cycles are shown in Figure S1 (H2+20 ppm CO), Figure S2 (SMR-WGS H2), Figure S3 (H2+5 ppm H2S) and Figure S4 (SMR-WGS-H2S). 3.3.1 H2 feed with 20 ppm CO Two MEA compositions were considered for offline regeneration from H2+20 ppm CO, Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt. As shown in Figure S1 and Fig. 7B, after 1 min with O2 at either 100 or 200 mV, on both Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs, the current densities of 1–1.1 A cm−2 at 100 mV and 1.5 A cm−2 at 200 mV are recovered. The mechanism of recovery is as described above in the online regeneration discussion, this CO oxidation is heterogeneous and electro-oxidation via Eqs. (6)–(8) and Eqs. 22-24, respectively. In order to determine the contribution from O2 to the oxidation of CO, the offline regeneration was performed with only N2 for 5 min, this is shown in Figure S1A. The offline regeneration with only N2 shows a recovery of >80%, indicating that O2 plays a role in regeneration, however, most of the regeneration occurs electrochemically with H2O (Eqs. (22)–(24)). 3.3.2 H2 feed from SMR-WGS The SMR-WGS H2 feed was considered for offline regeneration using only PtRu/Pt MEAs, shown in Figure S2 and Fig. 7B. Offline regeneration times of 1, 5 and 15 min with O2 at 100 mV and 200 mV partially recovers the EHP. The addition of ~4% O3+O2 at 200 mV is required to regenerate the EHP to current densities above 1.5 A cm−2. These results are in line with previous work by Nordio et al. [31] using a 50% H2 + 50% CO2, which showed poisoning from ERWGS reaction, which could be recovered after 5s with air at 1 L min−1, representative of 200 mL min−1 of O2, although CO may also be removed under pure N2 (>80%). This additional CO, generated from reactions with CO2, require longer offline regeneration times of 15 min, higher cell voltages of 200 mV and a more aggressive oxidising agent, ozone, to completely recover the EHP. The cell voltage dependence of the offline regeneration, also seen in the online regeneration which implies an electrochemical oxidation via Eqs. (22)–(24), as well as heterogenous oxidation with O2 via Eqs. (6)–(8) and O3 via Eqs. (20) and (21), of CO from the PtRu surface. 3.3.3 H2 feed with H2S Offline regeneration of the EHP after completely poisoning with H2S was done to understand the regeneration mechanism. A high concentration of 5 ppm H2S was chosen in order to rapidly poison the EHP, it should be noted that concentrations above 10–50 ppb H2S are unlikely in SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feeds [9], but 5 ppm was used to allow testing in a reasonable time period. After 4000–5000s exposure to H2+5 ppm H2S, the performance of the EHP is effectively zero due to complete poisoning of the anode (Figure S3). Figure S3G displays the offline regeneration with N2 at 200 mV for 19 min, this shows that regeneration does not occur with only N2, unlike in the case of CO. H2S binds strongly to Pt via Eqs. (9) and (10), which makes regeneration of MEAs difficult. Previous work on H2 PEMFC by Kakati and Kucernak [27] showed that after poisoning with 100 ppm H2S, the system could be offline regenerated with ~2% O3+O2 for 600s to recover 97–108% of the initial fuel cell performance. This EHP system differs from H2 PEMFC experiments with H2S in that the potential was constrained during offline regeneration and there is no oxygen on the cathode of an EHP, as there is in H2 PEMFC. The oxygen in H2 PEMFCs may crossover to the anode and assist with the oxidation of poisons, or H2S/CO crossover from the anode to the cathode and undergo oxidation. Since the EHP does not have oxygen on the cathode, the regeneration procedures need to be more rigorous. Fig. 7B demonstrates regeneration of the totally H2S poisoned EHP to ~1.4 A cm−2 (98% of initial activity), ~4% O3+O2 at 200 mV for 20 min is required. Offline regeneration with O2 via Eq. (14) allowed for partial recovery (30–50% shown in Fig. 7B), however, the current density decreased progressively with time after the initial recovery. This O2/O3 recovery mechanism is proposed to follow a heterogenous pathway via Eqs. (14)–(16). However, the EHP is not completely regenerated with ~4% O3+O2 at 200 mV for 20 min, as seen by the initial drop and slow decay in current density to 98%. This could be due to crossover of H2S from the anode to the cathode, which is more difficult to remove. 3.3.4 H2 feed from SMR-WGS-H2S The offline recovery for SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed is shown at 200 mV with ~4% O3+O2 for 20 min (Fig. 7A). The offline regeneration from the SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed under ~4% O3+O2 for 15 min at 100 mV is displayed in Figure S4 and Fig. 7B, this shows a partial recovery to ~75 of the initial current density. When the cell voltage is increased to 200 mV with ~4% O3+O2, the current density is further recovered to ~80–84% (~1–1.1 A cm−2, Figure S4) after 15 min and ~94–96% (~1.3 A cm−2) after 20 min (Fig. 7A). As discussed above in the offline regeneration with H2+5 ppm H2S, the H2S may cross over from the anode to the cathode and poison the Pt/C catalyst on the cathode. In the case of CO crossover poisoning the cathode catalyst, this may be removed via electrochemical oxidation. H2S is harder to remove than CO which may have crossed over, since O2 or O3 would also need to cross over to assist with the oxidation of H2S."
9,Recovery in H2 PEM fuel cells,"3.4 Recovery in H2 PEM fuel cells The most effective poison mitigation strategies were chosen for validation in H2 PEMFCs with a SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed at 550 mV cell voltage. The online regeneration was a 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleed (shown in Fig. 8 A) and offline regeneration was recovery under O2+~4% O3 for 20 min at 200 mV, the cell voltage was constrained at 200 mV to avoid potential excursions which may damage the PtRu or Pt catalysts (shown in Fig. 8B). The initial current density under pure H2 at 550 mV cell voltage was 1.11 ± 0.06 A cm−2 at 35 °C. After an initial rapid decay in current density after the anode feed was changed to SMR-WGS-H2S H2 (to ~20%, this initial dip was also observed in the EHP with a bleed), the current density recovered and stabilised at ~70% (0.8 A cm−2) for 7 h. The ISO standards (ISO 14687–2019) [4] set for purity to H2 PEMFC in automotive applications are 0.2 ppm CO, 2 ppm CO2, 2 ppm CH4 and 4 ppb H2S, here operation at ~70% current density with 100x, 92500x, 14500x and 25x the ISO standard for CO, CO2, CH4 and H2S, respectively, is shown using the combination of a CO tolerant anode catalyst (PtRu) and an O2/O3 bleed at 35 °C. Previous work on H2 PEMFCs with reformate contaminants, by Karimi & Li [61], utilising a bleed show a 12% drop in cell voltage for a H2 mixture containing ~24% CO2 and trace amounts of CO with a 0.5–4% O2 bleed at 80 °C. Another study by Sung et al. [62] investigated a 45% H2, 17% CO2, 3% CH4, 25 ppm CO, 1% O2, and 34% N2 feed at a constant current density of 300 mA cm−2 for 3000 h with a 5% air (~1% O2) bleed at 65 °C and observed a 3% decay in cell voltage. Moreover, Tingelöf et al. [63] reported that approximately 0.5% air bleed was required per 10 ppm CO at 60 °C. Modelling work by Zamel & Li [21] showed a 77% retention in current density by using a 1% O2 bleed with 100 ppm CO at 80 °C and an anode overpotential of 0.1 V. The effect of temperature on the poison tolerance of the PEMFC was also highlighted, showing an increase in temperature will improve the tolerance of the fuel cell to CO [21,64]. Thus, a cell operating at 35 °C is more affected by lower concentrations of CO than cells operating at higher temperatures. Additionally, the offline regeneration (Fig. 8B) recovered 102% (after 2000s) of the initial activity under pure H2. An improvement in performance after ozone treatment to a value higher than the initial (broken in) performance was seen both in offline cleaning work, and previously in work on recovering fuel cells from hydrogen sulfide and sulphur dioxide poisoning [27,28]. For instance, previous work by Kakati et al. found a fuel cell performance of 106% of initial performance at 0.6 V after exposure to hydrogen sulfide and offline regeneration with ozone (see Fig. 5 in Refs. [27]). This improvement is attributed to cleaning of the electrocatalyst through oxidation and removal of adventitious poisons which would otherwise build up within a normally operating fuel cell. The gradual decay in the higher performance is then due to the slow re-adsorption of those small quantities of contaminants (sub-pico molar quantities on the basis of the slow rate) which might exist within the catalyst layer. Thus, both regeneration strategies showed promising results, however, these strategies will need to be optimised for fuel cells. For instance, the bleed concentration, anode and cathode metal loadings, temperature and relative humidity were all optimised for the EHP setup and further work is required to optimise the H2 PEMFC regeneration protocol."
10,Conclusion,"This study looked at the effect of different poisons in the H2 feed to an EHP and different poison mitigation strategies. The different feed compositions considered were H2+20 ppm CO, 78.6% H2, 18.5% CO2, 2.9% CH4 and 20 ppm CO (SMR-WGS H2), H2+100 ppb H2S, H2+1 ppm H2S and 18.5% CO2, 2.9% CH4, 20 ppm CO and 100 ppb H2S (SMR-WGS-H2S H2). Two poison mitigation strategies were considered, online and offline regeneration. Online regeneration at 100 and 200 mV was performed by using two bleed compositions, 1.2% O2 and 1.15% O2+0.05% O3. Offline regeneration involved a potentiostatic hold with pure O2 or O2+4% O3 at a flowrate of 50 mL min−1 at a cell voltages of 100 and 200 mV. Firstly, the different anode catalysts were considered, Pt and PtRu. The PtRu anode catalyst was shown to be more poison tolerant than the Pt catalyst, therefore, the PtRu anode catalyst was used for the subsequently poisoned feeds. Starting with the H2+20 ppm CO feed, the 1.2% O2 and 1.15% O2+0.05% O3 bleeds were effective in improving the current densities obtained with both the Pt/Pt and PtRu/Pt MEAs. A voltage dependence of the current density on Pt/Pt MEAs suggested both an electrochemical oxidation of CO from the catalyst surface with O2 and O3, as well as chemical oxidation. For the PtRu/Pt MEA, minimum current densities of ~90% were achieved using both the O2 and O2/O3 bleeds at 100 and 200 mV, showing that due to the CO tolerance of PtRu, higher voltages and the addition of ozone was not necessary to improve the performance. The offline regeneration for this H2+20 ppm CO feed was 1 min of O2 at a flowrate of 50 mL min−1 at 100 mV or 200 mV to completely recover the MEA. The rate of poisoning of the MEA with the SMR-WGS H2 feed was shown to be faster, and the current densities when using the O2/O3 bleed are lower when compared to the H2+20 ppm CO feed. This faster rate of poisoning and lower current is likely due to reactions at the anode which form additional CO, these reactions could be the electrochemical reverse water gas shift reaction (ERWGS), methane electro-oxidation or heterogenous reactions with water/O2. Offline regeneration for this feed was determined to be 15 min of ~4% O3+O2 at 200 mV to completely recover the MEA to >1.5 A cm−2. For the H2+100 ppb H2S feed, it was found that the O2 and O2/O3 bleeds retained >97% of the initial current density, at both cell voltages of 100 mV and 200 mV. Moreover, the H2+1 ppm H2S feed with a O2/O3 bleed maintained >96% of the initial current density after 7 h with j m i n (extrapolated for after long periods of time) were 15.8–58.6%. However, when 100 ppb H2S is incorporated into the SMR-WGS H2 (SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed), the EHP had a lower current density of ~0.3 A cm−2 at 100 mV with 1.2% O2 bleed, which was dependent on voltage (~0.9 A cm−2 at 200 mV) and the presence of ozone (~1.1 A cm−2 at 200 mV). The best offline regeneration strategy for the H2+5 ppm H2S and SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed was 20 min of ~4% O3+O2 at 200 mV, although the EHP was not fully regenerated to the initial current densities. The EHP current densities were recovered to 98% after poisoning with the H2+5 ppm H2S feed and 94–96% with the SMR-WGS-H2S H2 feed. Finally, promising results were shown for both the online and offline regeneration strategies in a H2 PEMFC with the SMR-WGS-H2S, the O2/O3 bleed operation retained ~70% of the current density after 7 h and the offline regeneration recovered 102% of the current density after 20 min."
