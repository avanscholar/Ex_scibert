0,Introduction,"Liquid phase catalytic hydrogenations of CC and CC bonds-containing compounds are of high current interest to the manufacture of several market chemicals [1,2]. Thus, the stereo- and chemo-selective partial hydrogenation reaction of functionalized alkynes to alkenes is largely used in the synthesis of a variety of fine chemicals, including pharmaceutical and agrochemical building blocks, food additives, flavours and fragrances [3,4]. Partial hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes is critical in the bulk polymerization industry to achieve high product purity [5,6]. Compared to homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous systems are preferred for industrial applications due to the simpler integration in existing reactor equipments, cleaner downstream processing and easier reuse of expensive catalysts [7,8]. A main challenge in partial hydrogenation reactions is to achieve 100% selectivity to the desired product at high level of conversion [9,10]. A usual drawback of the processes is over-hydrogenation, i.e. alkanes are obtained as by-products, which ultimately results in selectivity and conversion to be inversely proportional [11,12]. When internal alkynes are to be hydrogenated, stereoselectivity issues must also be considered [13]. Among the heterogeneous catalysts developed over the years for these reactions, sophisticated systems based on solid-supported palladium nanoparticles (PdNP) containing variable, often large, quantities of toxic additives showed unsurpassed activity and selectivity [14,15]. Organic bases (e.g. quinoline [16,17], phosphines [18]), carbon monoxide [19], sulfides [20], sulfoxides [21,22], metal ions (Cu, Pb) [23] or polymers/surfactants [24] have been commonly used as a strategy to “selectively poison” palladium catalysts in order to reduce their hyperactivity. At the industrial level, the so-called Lindlar system, consisting of high amounts of Pd (5% wt) and Pb (2–3%) onto CaCO3, is frequently used in batch conditions for the partial hydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbons [25,26]. Additional shortcomings using modified solid catalysts include catalyst deactivation, limited reusability and the need of a careful control of the hydrogen uptake to achieve satisfactory performance [27,28]. It is therefore clear that the development of efficient, cost-effective, reproducible and environmentally friendly heterogeneous catalysts for the partial hydrogenation reaction of unsaturated CC bonds is of utmost importance [29,30]. Considerable process intensification and higher safety can be achieved by performing catalytic hydrogenations under the conditions of continuous flow [31,32]. Compared to batch operations, advantages are obtained in terms of reduction of processing steps, energy consumption and waste emission, easier purification, automation and enhanced space-time-yield productivity [33,34]. In addition, facile tuning of reaction conditions usually allows fast optimization of reaction outputs. For instance, in the continuous flow partial hydrogenation reaction of alkynes, adjustment of residence time enables the fine control of the contact period between reagents and catalyst, so that the intermediate alkene is swept away from the catalyst surface before being further hydrogenated, thus improving selectivity (Fig. 1 ) [35,36]. High yields of partial hydrogenation products can be therefore obtained without additives by selection of an appropriate flow reactor setup [37,38]. Liquid phase catalytic hydrogenations are usually achieved under continuous flow using concurrent streams of hydrogen and substrate solution through fixed bed devices, wherein reactors are classified into micro (10–500 μm) or mesofluidic (500 μm - several mm) on the basis of inner channels size [39,40]. Several reactor arrangements and catalyst morphologies are possible [41,42]. The most usual for the hydrogenation of hydrocarbons include honeycomb, packed-bed, monolithic and catalytic wall (film) systems. A schematic representation of these setups is reported in Fig. 2 . Honeycombs are composed of inert carrier materials, either ceramic, metal or plastic, shaped into multiple millimetre size parallel channels. The inner walls of the channels are then covered with a catalytic layer (10–500 μm thickness), usually consisting of a high surface area inorganic oxide carried (e.g. γ-Al2O3), upon which an active metal is dispersed [43,44]. The layer is commonly referred as catalyst washcoat. With few exceptions [45], honeycombs are used for unselective thermal processes in the gas-phase (e.g. combustion, pollutants abatement), due to the difficulties in achieving a homogeneous distribution of reactants within the channels, with consequent ineffective catalyst usage [46,47]. Packed reactors may accommodate solid catalysts of a wide range of dimensions and shapes. Common catalysts are based on metal nanoparticles immobilized onto randomly packed porous supports (μm - mm bead size). The preferred choice is for mesoporous materials (2–50 nm) due to the high surface area, however with resulting drawbacks in relation to pore clogging, sites accessibility, mass transfer limitations [48,49]. In addition, packed-bed systems may be affected by significant pressure drops, broad distribution of residence times, formation of hot-spots or stagnation zones, hence in poorly controlled fluid dynamics and low catalytic efficiency [50]. In order to circumvent these drawbacks, monolithic reactors [51] have been designed featuring an isotropic, open-cell hierarchical network of macro- and mesopores [52,53]. Both organic and inorganic support materials have been used to this purpose, with the latter providing better thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, limited volume and porosity changes with swelling and better radial permeability [54,55]. These monoliths join the advantages of high surface area typical of mesoporous materials with the low flow resistance typical of macroporous systems, resulting in efficient processing and mass-transfer [56]. Difficulties in this case are due to the hardly reproducible manufacture of monoliths, due to the sensitivity of the structure from the phase system composition [57,58]. Single-channels reactors are widely used in the lab-scale because of the effective heat transfer and fast mixing of reactants [59,60]. Issues may arise from both packing the catalyst into microchannels (10–1000 μm internal diameter) and significant back pressure evolution at high flow rates [61]. A potential solution is to immobilize the catalyst onto the inner wall of the channels (catalytic wall reactors) [62,63]. Different flow regimes may be attained in these devices depending on the relative rates of hydrogen and liquid flow and on the internal diameter size - namely bubbly, annular, churn, slug and segmented (Taylor) flow - with direct consequence on both conversion and selectivity of the hydrogenation process [64,65]. In the course of our studies on hybrid materials for electrochemical and catalytic applications [66,67], we recently described the synthesis of inorganic (zirconia)/polymeric (PVA, polyvinyl alcohol) hybrid materials with embedded Pd nanoparticles [68,69], and their use as catalysts in the partial hydrogenation reactions of various organic substrates in the liquid phase, both under batch [70] and continuous flow conditions [71]. A packed reactor system of 1.7 mm diameter pellets was used in the latter case. It was shown that the addition of zirconia greatly improves the resistance of the hybrid catalysts in hydrophilic solvents, hence, their potential for use under reaction conditions over prolonged reaction times. In the present paper we report the preparation of a catalytic wall reactor based on the above hybrid materials (iO-brane®) and its application to the partial hydrogenation reaction of representative diene and alkynes substrates under continuous flow conditions and different flow regimes."
1,Experimental,
2,General information,"2.1 General information Unless otherwise stated, all manipulations were routinely performed under nitrogen atmosphere by using standard Schlenk techniques. The palladium oxide-containing hybrid zirconia/PVA material (iO-brane®, whose composition in weight ratio to 80% saponified PVA normalized to 1 is ZrO2 0.14, PdO 0.21) was prepared as previously described [68,69]. All the other chemicals were reagent grade, commercial products and were used as received without further purification. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy measurements (ESEM) were performed on a FEI Quanta 200 microscope operating at 25 KeV accelerating voltage in the low-vacuum mode (1 torr) and equipped with an EDAX Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS). X-ray maps were acquired on the same instrument using a 512 × 400 matrix, 100 μs dwell time and 25 KeV accelerating voltage. Samples for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses were prepared by scratching the hybrid material layer from inside the tubes, followed by sonication for 30 min in ethanol and deposition of the supernatant onto a carbon coated lacey grid. TEM measurements were carried out using a CM12 PHILIPS instrument at 120 KeV accelerating voltage. Statistical nanoparticle size distribution analysis was typically carried out on 300–400 particles. Catalytic flow hydrogenations were carried out using a home-made continuous-flow reactor system constructed at Istituto di Chimica dei Composti Organo Metallici, Firenze (Italy). The system was designed to allow for a simultaneous flow of substrate solution and hydrogen gas through a reactor tube containing the heterogeneous catalyst. The reactor was completely inert, as all wet parts were made of PEEK, PFA or PFTE. The flow of the substrate solution was regulated by an Alltech® model 426 HPLC pump in PEEK. A constant flow of hydrogen gas was adjusted by a flow controller BRONKHORST HI-TEC model F200CV-002-RGD-11-V-MFC. The hydrogen pressure in the reactor was monitored by a BRONKHORST HI-TEC P502C-AGD-11-V-6K0R-EPC meter. The concurrent flows of gas and liquid were driven through a PEEK Y-shaped mixing tee equipped with a frit to ensure efficient gas dispersion. The mixed hydrogen-substrate solution stream was introduced in the reactor through a 6-port Rheodyne 9060 switching valve in PEEK. A hydrogen generator model Parker H2PEM-260 was used. At the outlet of the reactor, the product solution was collected for GC–MS and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and 30 m (0.25 mm i.d, 0.25 μm f.t.) SPB-1 and Varian VF-WAXms capillary columns. GC–MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu QP2010S spectrometer equipped with identical capillary columns. The metal content in the supported catalyst was determined by EDS analysis. The content of metal leached in the catalytic reaction solutions was determined by ICP-OES using a Varian 720 ES instrument. Palladium detection limit was (0.006 ppm). The solutions were analyzed directly after 1:2 dilution in 1% HNO3."
3,Preparation of the catalytic wall reactors,"2.2 Preparation of the catalytic wall reactors A raw aqueous dispersion of the hybrid material was prepared by mixing an oxyzirconium chloride aqueous solution (oxyzirconium chloride octahydrate 1.1 g, distilled water 20 mL), a palladium chloride aqueous solution (palladium chloride 1.2 g, sodium chloride 1.0 g, distilled water 20 mL), 0.72 g of carboxyl-modified silicone X-22-3701E (Shin-Etsu Chemical) and 100 mL of 10 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution. The PVA (Japan Vam & Poval) has saponification degree of 78.5–80.5% and it is characterized by a viscosity of 44–52 mPa･s (aqueous solution of 4%, 20 ℃). The raw solution was stirred and heated at about 40 ℃ for 1.5 h. A glass tube (10 cm length, 3.4 mm inner diameter) was charged with the above raw dispersion by a syringe. After 5 min the solution was drained out. The tube was then heated at 60 ℃ for half an hour. This preliminary coating treatment was repeated twice or more in order to obtain both the desired thickness of the hybrid layer and Pd content. The tube was then heated at 120℃ for an hour. After that time, the tube was cooled down to room temperature and filled with a 0.2 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and 0.044 M of sodium formate for 10 minute s. The inner surface of the tube was then washed with water at 80 ℃ (2 × 50 mL). The tube was finally heated at 120 ℃ for an hour. Palladium loading was established from EDS analysis (ca. 10% wt Pd) of the supported hybrid layer (typical weight ca. 1 mg). The glass tubes containing the inner iO-brane® layer were converted into catalytically active Pd°-containing materials by NaBH4 batch reduction. In a typical experiment, the glass tube (10 cm length, 3.4 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.6 μm, Pd content 0.124 mg) was dipped into a solution of NaBH4 (13 mg, molar ratio NaBH4 : Pd = 300:1) in 60 mL distilled water under nitrogen. The initially brown internal surface of the tube became darker and bubbles were generated. The mixture was left for 24 h under N2 atmosphere and room temperature. The tube was then washed with 3 × 100 mL degassed distilled water, 2 × 30 mL methanol, dried under high-vacuum and kept in a Schlenk tube under N2 atmosphere. The catalytic layer of the as-prepared tube (GT- iO-brane®-1) was characterized by ESEM, EDS and TEM analysis. An analogous procedure was adopted for the reduction of iO-brane® tubes with different Pd loading."
4,Catalytic hydrogenation reactions under continuous flow conditions,"2.3 Catalytic hydrogenation reactions under continuous flow conditions After reduction, the catalytic tubular wall reactor GT- iO-brane® was equipped with Swagelok fittings and nylon ferrules at each end, then connected through PEEK tubings to the continuous flow hydrogenation reactor equipment for the liquid-phase operations described above. Typical residence times, defining the amount of time that the reaction mixture spends inside the reactor, were in the range 20–200 s, corresponding to 0.1–0.5 mL min−1 substrate solution flow rate. Hydrogen flow rates were adjusted to have typical H2: substrate molar ratios inside the reactor in the range 1–30. An up flow arrangement was adopted. Catalytic hydrogenation reactions under continuous flow were carried out as follows. In a typical experiment, a N2-degassed solution of substrate in methanol (1,5-cyclooctadiene (1) = 0.055 M; 3-hexyn-1-ol (2) = 0.030 M,) was flown through the tubular wall reactor at a constant rate of 0.30 mL min−1 for 1 and 0.35 mL min−1 for 2, respectively, and room temperature. A concurrent, constant H2 flow of 1.20 mL min−1 and 0.56 mL min−1 was used, respectively. Under these conditions, the flow regimes detected were bubbly/segmented-type for 1 and segmented for 2, respectively. These flows resulted in a H2 pressure at the reactor inlet of ca. 2 bar (corresponding to a H2 : substrate molar ratio of ca. 6.6 and 4.4 for 1 and 2, respectively), while the hydrogen gas was released at atmospheric pressure at the outlet of the reactor. Therefore, the pressure drop generated by the wall reactor was ca. 1 bar. The attainment of the steady state conditions (ca. 0.5 h) was taken as the start time of the catalytic reaction. Reactions were typically followed for 5 h continuous time on stream. The reaction solution was periodically analyzed for conversion by GC, while aliquots were sampled every 1 h for subsequent Pd leaching analysis by ICP-OES. The catalytic tube was reused after washing with deaerated methanol at 1.5 mL min−1 for 1 h. The reaction products were unequivocally identified by comparison of the GC retention times and mass spectra with of those of authentic specimens. Quantitative analysis of the reaction products was carried out via GC based on calibration curves of pure compounds. Typical error was ±0.5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Hybrid organic - inorganic PdO/ZrO2/PVA materials with various Pd loadings were previously described as precursors for the manufacture of heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts, either in the form of membranes (60 ± 5 μm thickness) [70] or pellets (1.7 ± 0.2 mm diameter) [71]. The native materials were inactive prior of palladium reduction, however, treatment with NaBH4 under mild conditions allowed for the production of active Pd° species. Embedded PdNP were generated with typical size in the range 3.0–4.5 nm, evenly distributed within the solid matrix. In the present work, the hybrid material was layered onto the inner walls of glass tubes (1–4 mm internal diameter) by a simple deposition technique using a raw aqueous dispersion of hybrid palladium precursor [72]. Sequential repetition of the procedure resulted in different palladium loadings and layers thickness (0.5–1.5 μm) with an isotropic distribution along the whole tube length (≤1 m). After conventional borohydride reduction in water, the catalytic layer was characterized by ESEM, EDS and TEM analyses for morphology, Pd content and metal nanoparticles size determination. A representative ESEM image of a radial section of a glass tube showing the inner hybrid material layer is reported in Fig. 3 , wherein the film thickness is indicated. ESEM inspection of the film (Fig. 4 ) showed a reticular morphology of the coverage of the glass support. As previously reported for the parent hybrid pellets [71], the layered catalyst showed no significant difference of composition with respect to the native material by EDS analysis. A typical EDS spectrum of the catalytic layer is reported in Fig. 5 . The as-prepared wall-layered tubes were directly used as reactors for catalytic hydrogenation reactions under continuous flow conditions without further treatments, provided they were stored under nitrogen. Table 1 summarizes the labelling scheme adopted for the various wall reactors prepared. Irrespective of the Pd loading, TEM analysis showed the catalytic layer to contain a narrow size distribution of spheroidal PdNP with a 3.6 ± 0.9 nm mean diameter. A representative TEM image and the corresponding Pd particles size distribution are reported in Fig. 6 for GT- iO-brane®-3, as representative example. A surface/bulk palladium atoms ratio of 20% could be estimated from TEM data [73]. Chemisorption experiments were hampered by the limited accessibility of gas reactants to polymeric matrix in the dry state [74]. EDS maps showed the Pd metal to be evenly distributed throughout the catalytic layer. Similar PdNP size was previously found in the analogous pelletized hybrid catalysts [71]. The supported PdNP size was significantly lower than that reported for PVA-stabilized palladium colloids (8–50 nm) [75], that can be attributed to the steric stabilization of the polymeric matrix [76,77], and in line with that of other gel-type, polymer-supported heterogeneous Pd catalysts [78,79]. Variable PdNP dimensions were previously reported in Al2O3-washcoated catalysts, e.g. honeycombs (1.65 nm, 67% dispersion) [45] and foams (7 nm, 19% dispersion) [80]."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation reactions under continuous flow,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation reactions under continuous flow After equipment with Swagelok fitting, nylon ferrules and PEEK tubing (Fig. 7 ), the as-prepared hybrid layered tubes were connected to a home-made equipment allowing for concurrent and controlled flows of substrate solution and H2 gas through the catalytic wall reactor assembly (Fig. 8 ). The tubular reactor was set in a bottom-up flow arrangement. A down-flow setup resulted in poor liquid distribution and in irregular flow regimes under the fluid rates adopted. Catalytic partial hydrogenation reactions of functionalized hydrocarbons in continuous flow conditions were the performed using 1,5- cyclooctadiene (1) and 3-hexyn-1-ol (2) as probes. Choice of 1 and 2 was motivated by both their industrial relevance (vide infra) and by the fact that they are usual benchmark substrates for selectivity performance in semi-hydrogenation of dienes and internal alkynes, respectively, wherein stereoselectivity must also be considered. The potential hydrogenation products and the labelling scheme adopted are sketched in Scheme 1 . Both reactions were investigated using the wall reactors indicated in Table 1 under a wide range of H2 and substrate solution flow rates (methanol) and room temperature. For this substrates type, conversion and selectivity are known to be dependent from the flow conditions, particularly the residence time (τ) and the H2 : substrate molar ratio, and the combination thereof. Usually, the higher the τ (lower solution flow rates) and the H2 : substrate ratio (higher H2 flow rates), the higher the conversion and the lower the selectivity to the partial hydrogenation products, due to over hydrogenation. The partial hydrogenation of 1 produces cyclooctene (1a), a relevant monomer for the manufacture of a variety of polymers [81,82]. The formation of 1,4-cyclooctadiene (1b) may also be observed due to competitive hydro-isomerization reaction over supported PdNP catalysts, particularly at low H2 pressures [83,84]. Cis-3-hexen-1-ol (2a) is a valuable component of fragrances and perfumes (leaf alcohol) [85,86], which is currently produced in ca. 96% selectivity at 99% conversion by the partial hydrogenation of 2 using a batch process and Lindlar catalysts [87,88]. In the case in our hands, all catalysts were active under the flow reaction conditions adopted, showing very good to excellent selectivity to the partial hydrogenation products 1a and 2a at very low residence times and H2 : substrate ratios. The reaction conditions resulting in the best compromise results between conversion and selectivity for each reactor are reported in Table 2 and in Table 3 for 1 and 2, respectively. Productivities are indicated both as molprod gPd −1 h−1 and space-time-yield (STY, kgprod Lreactor −1 h−1) [89]. Selectivity to 1a was around 90% at ca. 70% conversion under 182 s residence time and ca. 6 H2 / substrate molar ratio, which results in ca. 0.08 kg L−1 h−1 STY. In the hydrogenation of 2, selectivity to the alkene was in the range 88–95%, of which ca. 90% was the cis isomer, at 70% conversion, under 156 s residence time and ca. 4 H2 / substrate molar ratio, resulting in ca. 0.05 kg L−1 h−1 STY to 2a. Use of a transparent glass tube allowed to monitor the flow regime established within the reactor. Under the conditions of Tables 2 and 3, the flow regimes observed were bubbly/segmented for 1 and segmented for 2, respectively (Fig. 9 ). In the latter case, a series of equally spaced liquid segments of ca 1.0–1.5 cm length was observed to flow within the reactor tube at regular rate. In a segmented flow, the contiguous portions of liquid and gas phase act as individual processing units. Mass transfer is due to convection within each segment and to diffusion through the continuously refreshing interface between adjacent segments, which enhances the contact with the catalyst layer and minimize diffusion limits (Fig. 10 ) [90,91]. Compared to bubbly flow, it has been suggested that segmented flow results in the formation of a thin liquid film between gas slugs and catalyst walls, while allowing an effective recirculation within segments [45,92]. This results in higher reaction rate and selectivity, as indeed observed in the case of 2, as well as for the hydrogenation of other alkynes substrates described in the literature, e.g. 2-butyne-1,4-diol [91,93]. Palladium leaching in solution was below the ICP-EOS detection limit in any case. The absence of catalytic activity of the recovered reaction solutions ruled out the contribution of homogeneous species to the hydrogenation process, indicating the catalysts to be truly heterogeneous [94]. Complete selectivity/conversion diagrams could be drawn for each wall reactor and for each substrate by changing the reaction flow parameters, i.e. the H2 : substrate ratio under fixed residence time and vice versa. Slightly different behaviours for 1 and 2 were observed. In the partial hydrogenation of 1, a pretty constant selectivity was usually observed with increasing conversion. The selectivity / conversion diagrams obtained at fixed 182 s residence time using the GT- iO-brane®-2 reactor is shown in Fig. 11 , left, as representative example. In the partial hydrogenation of 2, the selectivity to the ene product 2a + 2b significantly decreased with increasing conversion, as usually found using fixed bed catalytic reactors under continuous flow [35]. The diagram obtained using GT- iO-brane®-2 under a fixed residence time of 136 s is reported in Fig. 11, right, as example. The different behaviour can be tentatively attributed to the different flow regimes attained. Under a Taylor flow regime, a narrower residence time distribution of gas and liquid is expected [95], which may result in a higher sensitivity of catalyst performance to slight changes in reaction conditions, i.e. the contact time between substrate and active phase, and in better selectivity towards the partial hydrogenation product [96,97]. In the partial hydrogenation reaction of 1, the following key findings were observed using different GT- iO-brane® reactors under the same flow conditions: a) conversion and STY increased in the order GT- iO-brane®-1 < GT- iO-brane®-2 < GT- iO-brane®-3. This can be rationalized in terms of higher Pd content per unit reactor volume. b) selectivity was almost the same irrespective of the reactor. This can be ascribed to the same size of PdNP embedded in the catalyst layer. The formation of minor amounts of isomerization side product 1b (<7%) was observed in any case. Therefore, the selectivity for the hydrogenation reaction product, i.e. 1a / (1a + 1c), was actually higher (ca. 10%) than the overall selectivity indicated in Table 2. c) conversely to the Pd content, reactor productivity in terms of mol 1a gPd −1 h−1 decreased in the series GT- iO-brane®-1 > GT- iO-brane®-2 > GT- iO-brane®-3. This suggests a higher catalytic contribution of Pd particles directly exposed to the flow of reactants in the series, i.e. that for thicker catalyst layers the inner particles are less available, likely due to the permeability of the hybrid material. d) as a consequence of conversion and selectivity, yield of 1a increased in the series GT- iO-brane®-1 < GT- iO-brane®-2 < GT- iO-brane®-3. The highest yield observed was 69%, corresponding to a 0.08 kg L−1 h−1 STY of 1a. e) irrespective of the reactor, catalyst resistance was remarkable and slightly decreasing in the series GT- iO-brane®-3 > GT- iO-brane®-2 > GT- iO-brane®-1. The catalytic activity drop observed over 5 h time on stream is reported in graphical format in Fig. 12 . Numerical breakdown (%) for each reactor is reported in Table 4 . Since TEM analysis carried out after use in catalysis did not show any significant sintering of PdNP in any case, the trend observed can be tentatively attributed to a minor, undetectable loss of Pd active species in solution, which has greater consequences on the catalyst with lower Pd loading. Catalyst reuse was possible with no further activity decay, just by switching off the reactor system and restart it, provided it was stored under nitrogen or hydrogen meantime. f) catalyst's selectivity was not significantly affected by reactor usage. Irrespective of the catalyst, selectivity decrease was less than 0.4% over 5 h time on stream. (Fig. 13 ), that indicates the high stability of the catalysts. According to the above findings, the mean composition of the hydrogenation reaction solution of 1 over different GT- iO-brane® catalysts, under optimized flow conditions, can be represented as in Fig. 14 . Overall, these data indicate that the best reactor for the catalytic continuous flow partial hydrogenation reaction of 1, either in terms of product yield, catalyst resistance and STY, is GT- iO-brane®-3. Analogously, the continuous flow partial hydrogenation reaction of 2 over different GT- iO-brane® reactors under the same conditions showed that: a) conversion, STY (GT- iO-brane®-1 < GT- iO-brane®-2 < GT- iO-brane®-3) and productivity per mol Pd (series GT- iO-brane®-1 > GT- iO-brane®-2 > GT- iO-brane®-3) followed the same trend observed in the hydrogenation of 1. b)as above discussed, differences in catalyst selectivity was more pronounced with respect to the hydrogenation reaction of 1, with best results observed for the GT- iO-brane®-2 catalyst in this case, both in terms of chemoselectivity (2a + 2b) and stereoselectivity (2a). c) catalyst deactivation followed the same trend observed in the hydrogenation of 1. However, compared to 1, deactivation of catalyst GT- iO-brane®-1 was faster, while less pronounced for catalyst GT- iO-brane®-2 and catalyst GT- iO-brane®-3, respectively (Fig. 15 and Table 4). Selectivities over 5 h time on stream were also less regular (Figs. 16 and 17 ). Minor amounts of isomerization products were observed over GT- iO-brane®-3 catalyst. The mean composition of the hydrogenation reaction solution of 2 using different GT- iO-brane® catalysts is reported in Fig. 18 . Overall, because of stereoselectivity, the partial hydrogenation reaction of 2 showed to be more sensitive to slight changes in the catalytic reactor features compared to that of 1. In this case, the best catalyst in terms of desired product 2a yield, STY and catalyst resistance was GT- iO-brane®-2. As already reported for the corresponding pellet materials [71], the above findings indicate the resistance of the hybrid PVA/zirconia-supported PdNP under the conditions of catalytic hydrogenations. Deactivation of polymer-supported PdNP catalysts is commonly reported in the literature and attributed, inter alia, to dissolution of Pd crystallites, nanoparticles sintering and chemical degradation of the polymer [98,99]. PVA-supported palladium catalysts have been previously described for application to Suzuki–Miyaura [100], Heck [101] and chromium (VI) reduction [102] reactions, however with significant Pd leaching due to metal oxidation side-reactions. In the case in our hands, neither Pd loss was observed nor PdNP size increase, which can be attributed to the combination of several factors, including the steric stabilization of PdNP by the porous polymeric matrix [76], the strong metal-support-interaction effect of ZrO2 [103], the mechanical strengthening of PVA in the presence of hydrophilic solvents due to the addition of zirconia [71]. In terms of catalytic efficiency, GT- iO-brane® provided good compromise results between selectivity and conversion in continuous flow partial hydrogenation under very mild reaction conditions and very low content of palladium metal, that can be ascribed to both the good swelling propensity of PVA and the lack of strong interactions between functional groups from the polymer and the active sites [104]. In the partial hydrogenation reactions of 1 and 2, the GT- iO-brane® wall reactors showed similar selectivity at comparable conversion level compared to the corresponding packed bed reactor system (1.7 mm diameter pellets of Pd hybrid catalyst) [71]. Productivities were also similar for 1 and slightly lower for 2, respectively. Benefits with respect to the packed system rely in the much lower hydrogen to substrate molar ratio (4–11 for the wall reactor and ca. 11 for the packed reactor) and amount of hybrid catalytic material required to achieve comparable product yields (ca. 1 mg for the wall reactor and ca. 60 mg for the packed reactor), that can be ascribed to higher surface area available in the wall reactor system. The continuous flow, partial hydrogenation reaction of 1 has been described in the literature by PdNP-based catalysts immobilized either onto inorganic membranes [105], monoliths [106–108] or nanotubes [109]. Use of polymeric supports was also reported. Thus, compared to GT- iO-brane®, slightly better performance was provided under similar flow conditions using PdNP onto commercial, polystyrene ion-exchange resin beads (Pd@Dowex-Li, 150–300 μm), however a double amount of Pd metal was required in that case [110]. PdNP onto PVA membranes resulted in lower 1a yields [111], whereas pore-through-flow catalytic membranes based on polyacrylic acid [112,113] provided 1a in ca. 95% selectivity at 90% conversion, however under 50 °C and 10–40 bar H2. GT- iO-brane®-3 catalytic activity decay with time-on-stream was comparable with that previously reported, i.e. Pd@Dowex-Li, over an analogous timeframe [110]. A number of catalytic reactors, both packed-bed or monolithic type, have been reported for the partial hydrogenation reaction of 2 under continuous flow conditions in the liquid-phase. An up-to-date survey can be found in recent papers [35,108,114]. Most of these systems, as GT- iO-brane®, allow for the production of 2a with satisfactory selectivity without need of additives. To the best of our knowledge, the most efficient heterogeneous catalytic system described so far, in terms of product purity, is the polymeric macroporous monolith - PdNP supported Pd@MonoBor [115] and, in terms of 2a productivity per unit reactor volume and per unit Pd weight, is the titanate nanotubes-supported system Pd@TiNT [109]. Compared to the latter reactors, the performance of GT- iO-brane® ranks just below, but above that of PdNP onto conventional mesoporous or microporous supports [35]. If on one hand this confirms the efficiency of finely dispersed PdNP onto permeable supports for this reaction, on the other hand the GT- iO-brane® system provides clear advantages in terms of ease of reactor engineering. Compared to other polymer-supported Pd catalysts, the drop in efficiency of GT- iO-brane®-3 (ca. 1 mg) with time-one-stream, was similar to that of Pd@MonoBor (29 mg) [115] and slightly better than that of Pd@Dowex-Li (45 mg) [110], respectively, under similar reaction conditions. The so-called thermodynamic selectivity criterion established for the partial hydrogenation reaction of internal alkynes, states that “a selective catalyst involves strong adsorption of the alkyne and a low stability to the adsorbed alkene” [36]. Typical adsorption energies for alkynes and alkenes on Pd surface based on DFT calculations are around −1.7 eV and −0.8 eV, respectively [116]. As previously reported for 3-D egg-shell Pd catalysts [117], the good selectivity to 2a observed using GT- iO-brane® may be attributed to the easy accessible PdNP and to the morphology of layered catalyst, which allows for a short contact time between active site and intermediate alkene. As above discussed, establishment of segmented flow may also play a role in this case. Analogies can be established between the iO-brane® reactor and Pd@Al2O3 washcoated honeycomb catalysts. The latter have been described for the continuous flow, partial hydrogenation reaction of the alkyne 2-butyn-1,4-diol. It must be noticed that a high ene- and cis- selectivity (>93%) at 90% conversion was observed under a Taylor flow in that case as well, that was attributed to the high dispersion of palladium [45]. In that study, the superior performance of honeycombs, in terms of both selectivity and productivity, was highlighted compared to stirred tank and packed-bed systems. Washcoated reactors were also used in the catalytic hydrogenation of 3-methyl-1-pentyn-3-ol, however using a rotating foam stirred arrangement [80]. A better mass transfer rate and selectivity, but a worse activity, was obtained compared to the analogous slurry reactor."
8,Conclusions,"The catalytic partial hydrogenation reaction of multiple, unsaturated CC bonds in the liquid phase can be achieved under continuous flow conditions using solid-supported metal nanoparticles, either onto polymeric or inorganic materials [118,119]. Organic polymers are usually preferred due to practical benefits compared to inorganics: the composition of the polymers can be easily tuned so as to improve the sorption and permeability of reagents and products, additives can be incorporated, the manufacture technology of polymers is much developed thus allowing for a wider choice of materials [120,121]. Issues still exist in relation to the stability of the polymer, shrinking phenomena, volume and porosity changes with swelling, back pressure evolution and deactivation, which may adversely affect the long-term efficiency of the heterogeneous catalysts [122,123]. The addition of inorganic materials to a polymeric matrix, including raschig rings [124], glass [125] and others [126,127], has been used as a useful strategy to enhance the resistance of the catalysts. We have shown that palladium nanoparticles can be immobilized into a hybrid zirconia / PVA matrix to afford materials suitable for application to continuous flow, partial hydrogenation reactions in the liquid phase. Compared to the pure PVA, the addition of ZrO2 greatly improves the mechanical and chemical resistance of the support, while maintaining a good permeability to hydrophilic solvents. The partial hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons was carried out in flow mode with satisfactory selectivity under very mild conditions, with neither significant loss of catalytic performance and active metal over prolonged time on stream nor need of additives or regeneration treatments [128,129]. In addition, we have shown that use of the hybrid polymeric material allows for the facile engineering of wall reactors, thus to achieve effective miniaturization of a multiphase heterogeneous catalyst. The amount of Pd charged onto the wall reactor can also be easily modulated. This approach allows for the partial hydrogenation reaction to be achieved using very low amounts of supported catalyst (ca. 1 mg) and hydrogen/substrate molar ratios, thanks to the limitation of diffusional effects [130]. Leaching test experiments showed that the catalytic layer is not washed out under the hydrogenation condition adopted. The results described may be useful to the design of novel methods for the long-term, sustainable production of fine-chemicals and, particularly, to the engineering of new reactors and applications under continuous flow conditions [131,132]."
