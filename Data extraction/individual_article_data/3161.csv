0,Introduction,"Microalgae are grown in industrial wastewater through mixotrophic cultivation that utilizes carbon emissions from the same industry as a source of carbon has an enormous potential to be commercially valorized into various energy and non-energy related products (Cai et al., 2019; Chew et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2021). Fig. 1 Illustrates various such products produced from mixotrophic cultivated microalgal biomass. Microalgae consume the organic pollutants present in the wastewater, sunlight and carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere for bulk biomass production (Mohsenpour et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Yadav et al., 2021). This biomass was converted into biofuels and biochar primarily via hydrothermal liquefaction process (Xu et al., 2018; Cui et al., 2020). Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is one of the thermochemical conversion methodologies which has a huge commercial potential for biofuel production (Yuan et al., 2019; Alimoradi et al., 2020). This HTL process is employed on certain rigorous conditions such as temperature (200–400 °C), the residence time of about 15–120 min, and pressure (10–25 MPa) (Chen et al., 2018). Since water is used as a reaction medium in the HTL process, there is no necessity for the biomass to be dried (Meng et al., 2017). Emulsification, esterification, pyrolysis and hydro-treatment techniques are the other methods utilized for the production of bio-crude oil (Sharifzadeh et al., 2019). After sequential reactions (hydrolysis, repolymerization, decarboxylation, and dehydration), the wet biomass is converted into solid residue, gas product, bio-oil and HTL-AP with soluble nutrients and organics in it (Zheng et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). Despite providing useful applications, the HTL process possesses few drawbacks such as the formation of aqueous phase (HTL-AP), formation of gaseous products at higher temperatures, tedious cleaning process, scalability from lab scale to commercialization (Bueno et al., 2020; Cordova et al., 2020). The amount of aqueous phase formation primarily depends upon the biomass to solvent ratio and operating conditions (temperature, time and pressure) used in the HTL process. This wastewater also accounts for a high concentration of ammonia that is 1.86–7.07 g/L and also high chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 46–401 g/L (Watson et al., 2017). This wastewater is primarily comprised of sugars, acids, ketones, furans, alcohols, N-heterocyclic compounds, and cyclic hydrocarbon (Madsen et al., 2016). Additionally, due to the presence of highly toxic and hazardous elements, it poses a severe threat to our environment and the living organism (Tommaso et al., 2015). The economic viability of the process will be improved by HTL aqueous phase recycling or reuse. Despite the usage of bio-crude oil, the HTL-AP was also utilized in versatile applications such as platform chemicals recovery and reaction medium in HTL process (Liu et al., 2018). HTL-AP as co-solvent in HTL process increased the bio-oil yield with a lesser amount of organics penetration into the HTL-AP layer (Biller et al., 2016). Similarly, catalytic hydrothermal gasification is another means to valorise HTL-AP (Zhang et al., 2018). Hydrothermal gasification, thermochemical recycling, anaerobic fermentation, and several integrated pathways are such examples that push the fact that the HTL-AP must be reutilized properly compared to wastewater treatment. Recent studies have also shown that HTL-AP treatment produced gas fuels and electricity by the process such as biological (Si et al., 2019) and biochemical processing (Shen et al., 2018). Despite being advantageous, valorisation has its disadvantage such as inhibition in biological conversion, limited information in the literature regarding the comparison of technical, environmental, and economic challenges of the various approaches. It is necessary to determine the method by which the energy present within HTL-AP is to be unleashed. The idea behind this review was to consolidate all publications in various platforms like Elsevier, Springer and other resources that are made related to hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass for resource recovery. Mainly biofuel recovery was the ideal target of researchers those are working on thermo chemical processes. Various by-products like biochar, aqueous phase and gaseous products were recovered from the process. Currently researchers have changed their view on decoding applications of biochar. Not many studies were reported on recovering resource from hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater. Hence this review will provide economical benefits of hydrothermal liquefaction aqueous phase via resource recovery like enzymes, platform chemicals, etc."
1,Hydrothermal liquefaction,"Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), also called hydrous pyrolysis, will process any kind of biomass such as wet, dry, etc. Hydrous pyrolysis deals with the de-polymerization process which was carried out in an enclosed reactor at controlled pressure (10–25 MPa) and temperature (200–400 °C) (Xue et al., 2016; Yadav and Reddy, 2020). The HTL process produces liquid bio-crude oil as the primary product, with gas, aqueous, and solid residue as by-products. Wet biomass can be processed in HTL, but in the case of pyrolysis, the biomass must be free of moisture (<5%) (Gulab et al., 2016; Ranganathan and Savithri, 2019). Water is used as a solvent in the HTL process, as the conditions are towards the critical point of the water (374 °C and 22 MPa). This change in properties of water makes it possible to bring about a homogenous, fast and productive reaction. The subcritical water (374 °C) as a medium plays an important role in heat transfer and extraction processes (Watson et al., 2020). The product yield was primarily influenced by the process conditions (temperature, pressure, reaction time, catalyst, biomass to solvent ratio and the type of feedstock). There are multiple complex reactions taking place during the HTL process (Gollakota et al., 2018) among which, Depolymerisation, decomposition and recombination are the three major steps. Biomass gets disintegrated into several small compounds by the process of decomposition followed by de-polymerization (Gu et al., 2020). As these separate compounds are highly unstable, it undergoes recombination to form bio-crude oil, solid compounds, and gas. Residence time and temperature are the critical process parameters that define the products (Bio-crude oil, biochar, gaseous products and aqueous phase) distribution in HTL process. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, lignin, and other complex compounds make up the biomass. In HTL process, the biomass initially undergoes depolymerisation (Dandamudi et al., 2019; Onder et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). The thermal stability of the biomass was contributed by the hemicellulose and cellulose biopolymers. At a specific temperature and pressure the long-chain molecules are converted into short-chain hydrocarbons (Fernandez et al., 2018). The second step is decomposition, dehydration, decarboxylation, and deamination (Alba et al., 2013). The hydrolysis process converts the macromolecules found in wet biomass into monomers and polar oligomers. Breaking down the hydrogen bond in the complex cellulose molecule produces monomers like glucose. Glycolaldehyde, phenols, polar organic molecules, and organic acids are the main products of this step. The recombination and repolymerization of fragments in the third step. Due to the unavailability of the hydrogen compound, the reverse of the initial process occurs in this step (Liu et al., 2018). Coke formation or high molecular weight char compounds are formed when there is excessive unavailability of solvent (Reddy et al., 2013). Anastasakis and Ross (2015) investigated the ability of L. Hyperborea, L. digitata, and A. esculenta for biofuel production via HTL process at a temperature of 350 °C and residence time of 15 min and obtained a bio-crude yield of 9.8–17.8 wt % individually. The biomasses Nannochloropsis salina and Galdieria sulphuraria resulted in higher bio-oil yield (59 wt% and 31 wt%) when processed under subcritical conditions, temperature between 310 and 350 °C and at a pressure of 1.38 MPa (Cheng et al., 2019). From the previously mentioned studies, it was clear that bio-oil yield varies based upon the biomass used in HTL process. Biomass composition also plays a vital role in product distribution apart from HTL operating conditions (temperature, pressure, time, catalyst load and biomass to solvent ratio). In our previous study, C. vulgaris biomass upon liquefaction resulted in a higher bio-oil yield of 29.37 wt% at temperature of 300 °C and residence time of 60 min (Arun et al., 2018). Liquefaction of Tetraselmis sp. at a temperature of 350 °C, pressure of 5–21 MPa and residence time of 30 min resulted in a maximum bio-oil yield of 26.3% (Han et al., 2019). From these literature notes, it was clear that an increase in reaction temperature increased the biomass conversion percentage. However, further research is needed in depicting the exact mechanism and hindrance in the commercialization of this study from lab scale to industries."
2,Hydrothermal liquefaction-aqueous phase,"2.1 Hydrothermal liquefaction-aqueous phase The wastewater produced as a by-product of the HTL process is known as HTL-AP. HTL- AP's chemical oxygen demand (COD) reveals that it is made up of organic compounds. These organic compounds are used as a source of value-added compounds like platform chemicals. As a step ahead, this HTL-AP was explored as a reaction medium in HTL process (Chen et al., 2019a; Taghipour et al., 2021), a growth medium for algae (Das et al., 2020) and microbes for biomass recovery. In a recent study, it was reported that the HTL-AP obtained from algae, manure and sludge had COD of 84.4, 80.5, and 80.8 g/L respectively (Watson et al., 2020). HTL-AP valorisation techniques are difficult to perform practically because most of the bioconversion techniques will not be able to perform at high organics loading. As an example, in anaerobic fermentation, about 10 g COD/L of organic loading is required (Si et al., 2018) and similarly, it was 1–6 g COD/L in the case of the bio-electrochemical process (Shen et al., 2018). This shows that HTL-AP has to be diluted before the bioconversion method. The HTL-AP derived from the lignocellulose biomass comprises the least proportion of nitrogen content 0.8 g/L respectively. Henceforth, the total nitrogen content of this HTL-AP consisted mainly of organic nitrogen and ammonia (Gu et al., 2020). Table 1 elaborates the composition of HTL-AP obtained from various biomasses. The composition of HTL-AP shows that it can serve as a platform for various valuable products (Fig. 2 .). The total phosphorous content of HTL-AP was influenced by the feedstock composition as well as the method used to separate HTL-AP from the bio-oil (Li et al., 2017a; Leng et al., 2018). Recently, it was studied that HTL-AP can be used to cultivate C. vulgaris and wild-type Desmodesmus armatus (Chen et al., 2020). In another study, value-added products such as β-carotene and other platform chemicals were extracted from the HTL-AP produced from Dunaliella salina upon liquefaction at a temperature of 100–200 °C and reaction time of 60 min (Pirwitz et al., 2016)."
3,Resource recovery from HTL aqueous phase,
4,Resource for platform chemicals,"3.1 Resource for platform chemicals The HTL-AP is a potential source for the extraction of a wide variety of highly useful organic compounds. Monomers of Vinyl acetate can be produced from the HTL-AP (Rasrendra et al., 2011). In recent years, there has been a surge in demand for glycolic acid which has very good cosmetic applications (Vatankhah et al., 2020). It has been found that the HTL-AP has a high concentration of glycolic acid. Phenol extracted from the HTL-AP is a potential source in the petrochemical processes that are used for the production of dyes, anti-oxidants, pigments, alkyl phosphate, formaldehyde and urea resins, and resol resins (Holladay et al., 2007). HTL-AP of rice straw was utilized for the extraction of glucose, acetic acid, cyclopentenone, and monophenol (Lyu et al., 2015). HTL-AP was utilized to recover platform chemicals and carboxylic acids (Zhang et al., 2018). The HTL-AP obtained from the algae has a complicated organics distribution and thus there are not many reports on the production of the chemicals from HTL-AP of algae yet (Watson et al., 2020). The cost for the production of chemicals from the HTL-AP accounts for about 70% of the chemical price. Thus, more advanced technologies should be introduced for the cost-efficient and sustainable extraction of chemicals from the HTL-AP. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium are the three major inorganic compounds found in the HTL-AP. They have a wide range of uses as commercial fertilizers. The major source for the commercially used phosphorus was the geological deposits (Desmidt et al., 2015). Studies state that the amount of phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium present in the aqueous phase obtained from liquefaction of algae biomass was approximately 1–10, 5–20, and 1–8 g/L (Shakya et al., 2017; Quispe-Arpasi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). Generally, in Industries, ammonia is recovered from the HTL-AP using a method called stripping. Thus stripped ammonia can be utilized for the production of fertilizers. A recent study states that the air stripping method was preferred to extract 90% of ammonia from HTL-AP (McGinn et al., 2019). Despite all these technologies and methods for the extraction of nutrients from HTL-AP, the extraction of potassium from the HTL-AP is still challenging. There are still a lot of organic and inorganic compounds present in the HTL-AP that needs to be recovered. Thus the technology for the extraction of organic and inorganic compounds from the HTL-AP must flourish."
5,Algae cultivation,"3.2 Algae cultivation As the non-renewable sources for the production of fuels are being constantly depleted, scientists are looking forward to finding an alternative source for the production of fuel that is renewable and sustainable (Sivaramakrishnan et al., 2021). Mainly N, P, and K are necessary for a rich algal growth in a medium (Chew et al., 2020; Wágner et al., 2021). As the HTL-AP was rich in these nutrients, they are a very suitable medium for the growth of algae (Das et al., 2020). At present, many studies have been done on the growth of microalgae in the HTL-AP that are shown in Table 2 . In the majority of the cases, algae are used as the feed for the HTL process and many reports state that the HTL-AP from algae has a very good potential to support algal growth. Recent studies state that the algae uptakes and assimilates the P and N present in the HTL-AP. This is due to the fact that it is easy for the microalgae to convert ammoniacal nitrogen into amino acids (Alba et al., 2013). From the literature note, it was clear that majorly the HTL-AP was blended with water for algae cultivation. This was due to the composition of HTL-AP, since it has small chain compounds like acids, etc. Effect of various parameters such as growth period, aeration and temperature on algae growth in HTL-AP blended growth medium were reported in literature. Based on the mode of growth/yield quantification, researchers have reported the biomass yield as g/L, mg/L and mg/L.d respectively. Chlorella sp. was the most common microalgae cultivated using HTL-AP as a growth medium (Watson et al., 2017). HTL-AP obtained from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii resulted in 1.7 g/L of algae growth (Hognon et al., 2015). About 2.11 g/L of C. vulgaris algae biomass was cultivated from HTL-AP obtained from liquefaction of Chlorella soroliniana biomass (Chen et al., 2017). In another study, C. vulgaris biomass was cultivated from HTL-AP which was obtained from liquefaction of Nanochloropsis sp. at 350 °C and 35 MPa. In this study, the researchers obtained an algal biomass yield of 0.84 g/L (Li et al., 2017b). HTL-AP obtained from Phaeodactylum tricornutum at a temperature and pressure of 400 °C and 200 bar was utilized as a culture medium for the cultivation of P. tricornutum and it resulted in 13.4 g/L of biomass yield (Zhang et al., 2016). Despite the fact that the algae cultivation in the HTL-AP is uncomplicated, there are some challenges in it. The first one is the presence of organic and heavy metals in the HTL-AP (Leng et al., 2018). A large quantity of freshwater consumption makes the process economically inapt. In order to overcome these issues, many alternative methods like the incorporation of low-strength wastewater (Zhou et al., 2013), activated carbon (Erkelens et al., 2015), and zeolites (Wang et al., 2019) were studied."
6,Microbe cultivation,"3.3 Microbe cultivation Another potential use of the HTL-AP is that it can be utilized as a growth medium for cultivating microbial organisms for the recovery of value-added chemicals and biofuels. Recently, HTL-AP obtained from loblolly pine and marine Tetraselmis algae were used for the cultivation of Rhodococcus opacus and R. jostii. After 11 days, the R. jostii reduced the COD up to 93.4%, and R. opacus promoted the lipid accumulation of about 0.43 g/g cell dry weight (He et al., 2017). Similarly, the HTL-AP obtained from lignocellulosic biomass was used to cultivate Enterobacter species and it resulted in 9.4 folds in the microbial dry cell weight (Shende et al., 2017). The microbes undergo heterotrophic pathways to convert the organic constituents present in the HTL-AP more actively when compared to that of algae cultivation. HTL-AP of Nannochloropsis oculata at varying ratios (10–40 vol%) was utilized for the growth of E. Coli and Pseudomonas putida. The results showed that the maximum growth of the microbe was when 20 vol% of the HTL-AP was processed (Nelson et al., 2013). In HTL-AP, the microbe growth inhibitory compounds are the aldehydes. These inhibitory compounds damage the proteins and therefore causing the protein derivatives to get aggregated and misfolded (Jayakody et al., 2018). Modification of Pseudomonas putida genome resulted in increased tolerance or acclimatization (200-folds) towards HTL-AP (Jayakody et al., 2018)."
7,Liquid biofuels,"3.4 Liquid biofuels HTL-AP is a potential resource for enhancing the bio-oil yield in the thermochemical conversion process (Chen et al., 2019a; Jiang et al., 2020). The HTL-AP was also utilized in a mixture with the existing solvent system into the HTL reactor to enhance the yield of bio-oil. Table 3 elaborates the broad literature survey for liquid biofuels production from HTL-AP. Recycling of HTL-AP six times resulted in a bio-oil yield increase of 15.1% when compared to that of utilizing freshwater at a temperature of 350 °C for a reaction time of 20 min (Biller et al., 2016). HTL-AP recycle as reaction medium increased crude oil formation from 14% to 42% for six consecutive cycles at a temperature of 240 °C (Ramos-Tercero et al., 2015). In another study, recycle of HTL-AP obtained from Gracilaria gracillis and Cladophora glomerata resulted in a maximum bio-oil yield of 16–25% and 17–25% at third cycle respectively at a temperature of 350 °C for a reaction time of 15 min (Parsa et al., 2018). Recycling of C. vulgaris HTL-AP at the fourth cycle resulted in a maximum of 29–39% of bio-oil yield at a temperature of 275 °C for a time of 50 min (Hu et al., 2017). Recycle of HTL-AP obtained from the HTL of Spirulina plantesis at a temperature of 340 °C and time of 50 min showed a bio-oil yield of 30–40% at third cycle (Chen et al., 2019a). HTL-AP has the potential to improve the footprint and economics of the liquefaction process (Jensen et al., 2017). It was seen that the presence of low molecular compounds enhances biomass degradation during the HTL process. This methodology of recycling the HTL-AP will be a promising technique because it is cost-efficient, easy to incorporate, and comparatively simpler to scale up. This process of recycling the HTL-AP as a reaction medium has potential economic implications as in the coming years there might be a surge in the price of water commodity (Hu et al., 2017). Thus, in conclusion, this technique of valorising the HTL-AP has great potential and is a very suitable method for enhancing the properties of bio-crude oil and energy efficiency. Among all the other methods of valorising the HTL-AP, this method is very close to reaching the commercialization at full-scale."
8,Gaseous fuels,"3.5 Gaseous fuels 3.5.1 Methanation Various wastewater streams such as cosmetic wastewater (Puyol et al., 2011), olive mill wastewater (Gonçalves et al., 2012), and coal gasification wastewater (Zhao and Liu, 2016) have been utilized for methane production in past. The effect of algae growth inhibitors (organics and heavy metals) in the HTL-AP can be reduced by appropriate pre-treatment techniques as mentioned in Table 4 . The addition of activated carbon resulted in a 13–298% increase in methane yield with a shorter lag phase. Table 5 shows a literature review on valorising HTL-AP in the anaerobic digestion process to produce useful methane. In one analysis, HTL-AP with a volume of 20–40% was mixed with manure to produce methane with 244–313 mL/g COD via anaerobic digestion (Fernandez et al., 2018). In this process of utilizing HTL-AP, microbes play a significant role. At present, we do not have many studies on the effect of microbes on the AD of HTL-AP (Si et al., 2019). The organic compounds present in the HTL-AP increased the syngas formation by enhancing the degradation of the substrate. In the anaerobic digesters, the HTL-AP was mixed in proportion to the amount of waste substrate used. Interestingly, it was also reported that the composition of HTL-AP possess can affect the methanogenic activity in the anaerobic digester due to negative effects on microbes growth (Fernandez et al., 2018). Methanation has many benefits, including the production of biogas, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of organic manure (Paolini et al., 2018). Hydrolysis, Acidogenesis, Acetogenesis, and methanogenesis are the four primary steps in the anaerobic digestion (AD) method, and the step that limits the rate of the process is methanogenesis (Anukam et al., 2019). This technique of valorising the HTL-AP for the production of methane is a very good alternative for many other fuels obtained from non-renewable resources and is sustainable, eco-friendly, and cost-efficient. 3.5.2 Gasification Gasification is a process where carbon-rich feedstock is partially oxidized by supplying limited oxygen or steam, at a temperature in the range of about 100–1000 °C to produce syngas. Syngas is a gaseous mixture that contains mainly CO, CO2, CH4, and H2 (Raheem et al., 2018). This technology is utilized to make use of the trapped organic matter in the HTL-AP. The hydrogen yield from HTL-AP through the gasification process is detailed in Table 6 . Gasification of HTL-AP in 600 °C and 120 min resulted in a hydrogen yield of 21–58% (Duan et al., 2018). The inorganic compounds in HTL-AP act as a catalyst in the gasification process and thus enhancing the gasification efficiency and hydrogen production. HTL-AP of C. vulgaris under controlled conditions in the gasification process produced hydrogen of 3.31–23.65 mg/L, with the loading of 11,000 mg/L to 2000 mg/L (Cherad et al., 2016). HTL-AP processed via gasification process can result in reduced COD and TOC (Total Organic Carbon) value to a greater extent. From the literature note, it was seen that the higher temperature of gasification resulted in more amount of syngas formation. The biomass initially undergoes multiple reactions like water gas shift, methanation, steam reforming, etc. By water gas shift reaction or low range liquid hydrocarbon via Fisher-Tropsch synthesis, the additionally produced syngas can be converted into hydrogen (Raheem et al., 2017)."
9,Value addition of algae biomass cultivated from HTL-AP,"Algae is a valuable resource for recovering high-value products. Plant biostimulants include phytohormones, polymers, and small molecules. These biostimulants can improve crop production while also protecting it from abiotic stresses. These biostimulants are being researched using wild-type microalgae as a source. Biostimulants-based microalgae are still in the research stage; further research is required to determine commercial applications. Terpenoids, the largest class of products that comprises a countless number of bioactive secondary metabolites synthesized by plants. These have many applications such as biofuels, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals (Vickers et al., 2017). Plants typically produce just a trace amount of these secondary metabolites, so using genetically modified microalgae, these secondary metabolites may be formed in large quantities and concentrations (Vavitsas et al., 2018; Lauersen, 2019). The three major steps involved in the production of value-added products from algae is harvesting, extraction, and purification. Traditional extraction techniques include mechanical methods such as mixing and bead beating, ultrasound, and high-pressure homogenization, as well as chemical methods such as solvent extraction. Microalgae biomass contains carbohydrates of 50% of its dry matter. Monosaccharides such as fructose, galactose, manose, glucose, cellulose, and starch are present in microalgae biomass. The polysaccharides (Starch and Glucose) that are extracted from microalgae are utilized for bioethanol and biohydrogen production (Chochois et al., 2009). The carbohydrates that are extracted from the microalgae can be utilized in the pharmaceutical industries (Chew et al., 2017), biofuel production (Markou et al., 2012), textile industries, food industries, and in the production of thickening agents, water-soluble lubricants, stabilizers, thickeners, clinical drugs and emulsifiers (Arad and Levy-Ontman, 2010)."
10,Valuable enzymes from algae biomass,"4.1 Valuable enzymes from algae biomass Enzymes are essential compounds that play a major role in the reactions, scaling, and optimization of processes. Enzymes are, in reality, the most competent candidate for the majority of industrial processes. The demand for efficient enzymes to improve industrial processes is currently on the rise. As a result, a lot of research is being conducted to find a renewable source. Among many other sources, one of the potential sources for enzyme synthesis is algae biomass. In literature, the valuable Δ6-Desaturase enzyme was extracted from Phaeodactylum tricornutum microalgae (Zhu et al., 2017). Similarly, various enzymes such as acetyl-CoA, acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, photodecarboxylase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phospholipase A2 are produced from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella ellipsoidea, Chlorella variabilis, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Guo et al., 2017; Sorigué et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2017; Rengel et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2019). In addition to this, many more investigations have been done on the extraction of many valuable enzymes from the microalgae and among which, few are detailed in Table 7 ."
11,Challenges and future prospects,"It is transparent that HTL could process any type of biomass to recover various valuable products. HTL-AP can be a vital candidate for producing value-added chemicals, fuels, and electric gases. The major outcomes of the review were elaborated on in Table 8 . There are many feasible approaches for the conversion of HTL-AP, each of which has its pros and cons. This section explicates the summary of the limitations and advantages of all the processes studied. The HTL-AP, which has a simple composition, has been the subject of recent studies. Indeed, shifting the study's focus to treating the HTL-AP with a complex composition would increase the chances of recovering several more useful products. Additionally, it also encounters the problem of sustainability and economic barrier. On the other hand, separation of HLT-AP after HTL process and converting it into valuable products using biological methods have great potentiality in near future. Algae biomass can be cultivated in HTL-AP but it may not be as comparable with other chemical mediums. This was due to the growth inhibition of certain compounds present in the HTL-AP. Hence these inhibitory compounds must be processed to enhance biomass yield. In terms of cost and efficiency, still, further investigation is needed for this technique to prosper at a large-scale level. The anaerobic technique also serves a good purpose in terms of commercial application. However, the conversion of organics with nitrogen is poor and the residual effluent should be treated again by any other valorisation techniques. Further, the functional microbes must be enriched prior to treatment, and to enhance anaerobic fermentation, bio-augmentation must be conducted. Recycling can be employed in valorisation techniques such as gasification, liquefaction, etc. to reduce operational costs. Gasification is a crucial technique, but it requires a large amount of input energy, catalyst, and high reactor conditions. Although gasification can be incorporated on a large scale, there are many complications in decoding the reaction mechanism and pathways."
12,Conclusion,"To conclude, this review analyses the biological and chemical techniques for the valorisation of HTL-AP that was ended up as a by-product from HTL of biomass. To start with, the review was focused to depict the characteristics of HTL-AP for reuse and recycle. This review also comprises pathways for value addition of HTL-AP via algae cultivation, microbe cultivation, biofuel production, green fuel production. Further, it has been suggested that more focus has to be brought on HTL-AP and try to make the process energy-efficient, economical with less environmental impacts. Therefore, the integrated models possess a promising potential for HTL-AP valorisation."
