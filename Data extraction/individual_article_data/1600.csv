0,Introduction,"In drug development, low molecular weight compounds are often poorly water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) classified in the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) as class II (high permeability, low solubility) or class IV (low permeability, low solubility). Therefore, technology that can improve the solubility of highly hydrophobic APIs is needed [1]. Solid dispersion is a versatile technology used to develop oral solid dosage forms of poorly water-soluble drugs. A solid dispersion is defined as a dispersed mixture of one or more APIs in an inert carrier in the solid state [2]. Drug molecules in solid dispersions are often in an amorphous state, a higher energy state than crystals, which can lead to supersaturated solubility of the drug in aqueous medium and improved solubility [3]. Several techniques have been developed to produce solid dispersions, such as melting, solvent evaporation, solvent dissolution, grinding, spray dry, supercritical fluid processing, and hot-melt extrusion (HME) [4–6]. When producing pharmaceutical solid dispersions, an appropriate pharmaceutical carrier and manufacturing process for the target drug must be selected. Pharmaceutical polymers are often melt-blended with APIs at high temperatures to prepare solid dispersions. HME techniques, especially continuous processes, are ideal for manufacturing solid dispersions with high productivity [7]. A notable advantage of HME is the short exposure time to elevated temperatures, which largely alleviates concerns of API thermal instability and renders HME a suitable method for the mass production of pharmaceuticals. However, HME energy input from shear forces and high temperatures may cause API and excipient degradation that could significantly affect the product quality [8]. Electrospinning is a technique for fabricating polymeric nanofibers by applying a high-voltage electric field to a polymer solution via a flat-tipped metal needle (spinneret). Electrospun polymeric nanofibers are attracting attention as superior drug delivery systems, enabling pharmaceutical formulators to tailor drug release profiles according to the polymer properties [9]. To begin the electrospinning process, polymer jets are ejected from the Taylor cone at the nozzle tip of the spinneret. The electrical force applied to the working polymer solution overcomes the surface tension, ejecting a thin liquid jet. Bending and whipping of the polymer jet and subsequent drying of the solvent occurs as the liquid jet reaches the collector, assembling a solid nanofiber mat in a web structure on the collector [10]. The rapid solvent evaporation and drying speed in the formation process facilitate the manufacturing of dried fiber mats at room temperature. Therefore, electrospinning techniques are ideal for preparing drug–polymer complexes containing heat-sensitive APIs or inactive ingredients that cannot be processed using melting methods such as HME. Electrospinning directly converts the starting polymer solution into solid fiber sheets, enabling efficient production of polymer matrix carriers with homogeneous API dispersion, assuring drug content uniformity. Moreover, downsizing the drug to submicron size increases the specific surface area, enhancing solubility and bioavailability [11]. Preparing solid dispersions of poorly water-soluble drugs using polymeric nanofibers with large specific surface areas and high porosity is expected to dramatically improve solubility [12]. In this research, we investigated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an electro-spinnable material for preparing solid dispersions of poorly water-soluble drugs. PVA is a pH-independent, water-soluble, safe, and biocompatible synthetic polymer and is approved as a pharmaceutical excipient. The physical properties of PVA, including water solubility, are determined by the degree of hydrolysis (the ratio of hydroxyl/acetyl groups) and the degree of polymerization (the number of monomers forming a polymer) [13–15]. The degrees of hydrolysis and polymerization differ among the grades of PVA, which can be selected based on the intended application. PVA is widely used for binding, coating polymer, thickening, and emulsifying in the pharmaceutical field. Furthermore, by appropriately tailoring the molecular weight and concentration of the PVA solution, a homogeneous flat fiber mat can be prepared via electrospinning [16]. Recent studies have reported that preparing solid dispersions using PVA improved the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs [17,18]. The application of PVA nanofibers as a solid dispersion system for hydrophobic APIs has also been reported [19–21]. Since PVA is insoluble in organic solvents, the inclusion of hydrophobic APIs in PVA nanofibers requires uniform and stable drug dispersion in the aqueous continuous phase (PVA solution) before electrospinning. Gordon et al. produced PVA nanofibers with confined amorphous celecoxib nanoparticles by electrospinning PVA in volatile oil/water (o/w) nanoemulsions in the continuous phase via the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method [19]. However, the study did not examine drug release from the formulated PVA nanofibers nor optimize the PVA grade selection for PVA nanofiber dispersion of hydrophobic APIs. Low-energy emulsification methods, such as PIT technology, require the optimization of the formulation, emulsion composition, and temperature, which affect the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance values of the system. Alternatively, high-energy emulsification methods using mechanical shear forces, such as high-pressure homogenizers, are suitable for industrial applications because they allow flexible control of particle size distribution and the generation of submicron-sized emulsions from a variety of materials [22]. In this study, we fabricated nanofibers by electrospinning a nano-sized o/w emulsion prepared by homogenizing the drug solution dissolved in a volatile solvent (droplet phase) and PVA solution (aqueous continuous phase). Using different PVA grades, PVA nanofibers were designed as solid dispersions to improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. We characterized the physical properties and drug dissolution of the hydrophobic-API-embedded PVA nanofibers prepared by electrospinning. Polysorbate 80 (P80) was selected as an emulsifier to evaluate the effect of surfactants on PVA nanofiber solubility. For comparison with PVA nanofibers, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofibers were electrospun from a working polymer solution in which the drug was completely dissolved in an ethanol solution of PVP, a common solid dispersion polymer [23]. We used probucol (PBC), a typical BCS class II, as a poorly water-soluble model drug. The aqueous solubility of PBC is 3–5 ng/mL, resulting in an extremely low oral bioavailability of 2%–8% [24,25]."

3,Preparation of drug-loaded o/w emulsion using PVA,"2.2 Preparation of drug-loaded o/w emulsion using PVA Table 2 shows the composition and drug content of 13 PBC-containing PVA nanofiber formulations evaluated in this study (F1 to F13). The PVA solution was prepared by adding PVA to distilled water at 80 °C with stirring. In the formulations with P80, P80 was mixed into the PVA solution at room temperature. The o/w emulsion was prepared by adding PBC dissolved in an organic solvent to the PVA solution and emulsifying twice using a homogenizer (Polytron Model PT10-35, Kinematica AG, Luzernerstrasse, Switzerland) at a stirring speed of 8000 rpm for 5 min. Ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate were used as solvents for PBC at a weight ratio of 1/4 organic solvent/water. C6 was added to the oil phase to fluorescently label the PVA nanofibers at a weight ratio of 1/0.05 organic solvent/C6. Emulsion samples were diluted 100-fold with distilled water before measuring particle size using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) based on the dynamic light scattering (DLS) principle."
4,Preparation of drug/PVP solution,2.3 Preparation of drug/PVP solution Table 3 shows the formulation and drug content of PBC-containing PVP nanofibers. PBC and PVP were added to ethanol and dissolved at a stirring speed of 500 rpm; the PVP concentration was 15% (w/w).
5,Preparation of drug-loaded polymeric nanofibers by electrospinning,"2.4 Preparation of drug-loaded polymeric nanofibers by electrospinning For the electrospinning process, the PBC-containing PVA emulsion or PVP solution was loaded into a syringe with a 22G non-beveled needle (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Randomly oriented nanofibers were electrospun by applying 10 kV to the needle using a high-voltage supplier (HVU–30P100, MECC CO., LTD., Fukuoka, Japan). The standing plate collector was located 12 cm from the needle, and the PVA emulsion or PVP solution was loaded at a feed rate of 0.5 mL/h using a syringe pump (Yutaka Electronics Manufacturing, Gifu, Japan)."
6,Physicochemical properties of PBC-loaded nanofibers,"2.5 Physicochemical properties of PBC-loaded nanofibers The nanofiber mat prepared by electrospinning was imaged using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6510LV, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The fiber diameter (mean and standard deviation) was calculated by measuring 100 randomly selected locations from SEM images using image analysis software (ImageJ™, NIH). PVA nanofibers loaded with C6 were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; LSM-700; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Thermal analysis of drug-loaded nanofibers was performed using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC; EXSTAR6000; Seiko Instruments Inc., Chiba, Japan). The sample was placed in an aluminum sample pan for measurement as the temperature increased at 10 °C/min. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany, 40 kV, 40 mA) was used to determine the crystalline state of APIs over a 2θ range of 5°–40° using Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å wavelength). The PBC content in the recovered nanofibers dissolved in a 2/1 acetonitrile/distilled water mixture was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC conditions are shown in the Supplementary Methods ."
7,Dissolution test,"2.6 Dissolution test PBC formulation dissolution tests were performed using the paddle method (Apparatus 2) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP 17th Edition). A sample containing 5 mg PBC was added to 900 mL of 0.1% (w/w) P80 solution in distilled water at 37 °C ± 0.5 °C under paddle stirring at a rotation speed of 50 rpm. The PBC nanofibers were loaded into the dissolution test vessel using an alternative sinker as specified in JP17. At specific time intervals, 1-mL samples were withdrawn and filtered through a 0.45-μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter. The PBC concentration in the collected samples was determined using HPLC."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effects of PVA grades and PBC contents on the characteristics of drug-loaded nanofibers,"3.1 Effects of PVA grades and PBC contents on the characteristics of drug-loaded nanofibers In this study, we investigated PVA as a base material for preparing hydrophobic API-loaded nanofibers via o/w emulsion. In a preliminary experiment, we prepared a working solution of ethanol PBC solution and aqueous PVA solution (not an emulsion) and generated solid dispersion nanofibers ( Supplementary Methods ). Microscopic images of the PBC suspension showed that the PBC crystallized immediately after the working solution was prepared. The crystals in the fibers were irregular and coarse, and a dramatic improvement of PBC solubility could not be achieved ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Our preliminary investigations confirmed that homogeneous dispersion of the PBC molecules or particles throughout the PVA nanofibers was essential; thus, we used emulsion electrospinning to prepare a solid dispersion. Differing degrees of polymerization and hydrolysis among PVA grades affect properties such as solubility. We used partially hydrolyzed PVAs (80%, 88%) and fully hydrolyzed PVAs (98%, 98.5%) with different degrees of polymerization, as shown in Table 1. PVA also acts as an emulsifier, encouraging droplet dispersion in emulsion systems [26]. Therefore, PVA is an ideal material for preparing drug-containing nanofibers from stable and surfactant-free o/w emulsions with simple formulations. Since the hydroxyl and vinyl groups of PVA interact with the aqueous phase and oil phase (organic solvents), respectively, the concentration and type of PVA could affect the emulsion stability. Five PVA grades were used as dispersion stabilizers to evaluate their effects on the o/w emulsion. Throughout this study, the viscosity of the PVA solution for electrospinning was tuned to 2000 mPa-s. Fully hydrolyzed PVAs (PVA17-98, PVA5-98) formed o/w emulsions with poor dispersibility that gradually gelled. Fully hydrolyzed PVAs tend to gelatinize due to high surface tension and increased hydrogen bonds between PVA molecular chains, resulting in poor spinnability [27]. In contrast, stable o/w emulsions with particle sizes ranging from 300 to 500 nm could be prepared using partially hydrolyzed PVAs. The average particle size of o/w emulsions prepared using PVA24-88, PVA6-88, and PVA25-80 were 448.0 nm, 358.5 nm, and 547.6 nm, respectively. We used these PVA o/w emulsions to prepare PBC-containing PVA nanofibers. The o/w emulsions with partially hydrolyzed PVA showed good spinnability. In the case of F7 with PVA24-88, approximately 0.5 g of nanofiber mats were collected by continuous electrospinning at 0.5 mL/h for approximately 12 h (at least 70% yield). During the process of emulsion electrospinning, the emulsion droplets are condensed and stretched into an elliptical shape in the axial direction of the nanofibers [28]. SEM images showed that the PVA24-88 nanofibers had a linear cylindrical structure with a smooth surface (Fig. 1 a). PVAs with less polymerization, such as PVA6-88 (Fig. 1b), had smaller fiber diameters due to less physical entanglement between PVA chains. Additionally, the particle size of the PVA6-88 emulsion (358.5 nm) was larger than the fiber diameter (185 nm) after electrospinning, resulting in the formation of beads on the fibers (Fig. 1b). PVA25-80 (Fig. 1c) nanofibers had rough surfaces and a smaller diameter than PVA24-88 (Fig. 1a). The aqueous solution of partially hydrolyzed PVA25-80 had weaker surface tension [27] and was more susceptible to the electro-force field during the electrospinning process, producing a smaller fiber diameter. The fully hydrolyzed PVA17-98 emulsion partially gelled, resulting in a large variation in the fiber diameters (Fig. 1d). Preparing nanofibers from the fully hydrolyzed PVA5-98 emulsion was difficult due to gelation. These results show that homogeneous PBC-containing nanofibers could be developed from o/w emulsions prepared with partially hydrolyzed, highly polymerized PVAs. The PBC content also affected nanofiber diameter; compared to PVA24-88 nanofibers with 10% PBC (F1), those containing 20% (F6, Fig. 1e) or 30% (F7, Fig. 1f) PBC had larger fiber diameters. Some dents were also observed on the surface of nanofibers with higher PBC contents. The PBC contents in the developed nanofibers were almost equal to the theoretical values shown in Table 1, confirming that no PBC losses occurred during the emulsion formation and electrospinning process. Crystal polymorphs in pharmaceuticals affect API bioavailability. We investigated the effects of different PVA grades on the physical properties of PBC-containing nanofibers. We used PXRD and DSC to evaluate the crystallinity of PBC-containing nanofibers produced using the four PVA types (PVA24-88, PVA6-88, PVA25-80, and PVA17-98) that successfully formed nanofibers by electrospinning. Fig. 2 a shows the PXRD patterns of PBC-containing PVA nanofibers. The physical mixture containing 10% PBC exhibited PXRD peaks derived from PBC crystals, whereas the PBC-containing nanofibers generated a halo pattern. The DSC measurement results are presented in Fig. 2b. An endothermic peak was produced due to the melting of PBC crystals at around 125 °C in the untreated PBC original and physical mixture. An endothermic peak derived from PBC crystals was not present in the PVA24-88 nanofiber measurement, indicating that PBC was amorphous in PVA24-88 nanofibers. Very small endothermic peaks derived from PBC crystals were observed around 120 °C for nanofibers prepared using PVA6-88 and PVA25-80, suggesting that PBC may be partially crystallized but are mostly amorphous in these nanofibers. A relatively large endothermic peak derived from PBC crystals was observed in PVA17-98 nanofibers. The PBC molecules were not uniformly dispersed in the nanofibers because the PVA17-98 emulsion was gelatinized and partially phase-separated, which induced PBC crystallization. The PBC crystal endothermic peaks in F2–F4 nanofibers (formulated with PVA6-88, PVA25-80, and PVA17-98) were at a lower temperature than that of untreated PBC. The confined PBC nanoparticle crystals in the nanofibers may have shifted the melting point to a lower temperature due to the Gibbs–Thomson effect [29]."
10,Effects of PVA grades and PBC contents on drug dissolution from nanofibers,"3.2 Effects of PVA grades and PBC contents on drug dissolution from nanofibers The PBC-containing PVA nanofiber dissolution test was conducted according to the standard JP17 protocol. Fig. 3 a shows the results of in vitro dissolution of PBC and PBC-loaded nanofibers prepared using different grades of PVA. The bulk PBC did not dissolve and could not be detected by HPLC after 24 h of dissolution. In contrast, all PBC-containing nanofibers prepared using partially hydrolyzed PVAs (F1–F3) achieved drug dissolution rates of more than 80% after 24 h. In particular, PVA24-88 nanofibers (F1) exhibited the highest PBC solubility improvement. Nanofibers have huge specific surface areas and ultrafine structures, resulting in a large area in contact with water. In addition, nanofiber mat pores are larger than the fiber diameters, with porosities of 80%–90%, allowing for efficient water absorption and fiber disentanglement and dissolution after water uptake and swelling [12,30]. The PXRD (Fig. 2a) and DSC (Fig. 2b) results demonstrate that the solubility improvement can also be attributed to the nearly amorphous state of PBC in the nanofibers. Since PVA6-88 has a low degree of polymerization and is easily soluble in water, the F2 nanofibers showed the most rapid initial dissolution in the first 2 h of the dissolution test. However, the PBC dissolution rate after 24 h was lower in F2 than F1 nanofibers, which could be attributed to the partial crystallization of PBC embedded in the PVAF6-88 nanofibers (Fig. 2b). PVA25-80 nanofibers (F3) had a slower PBC release rate than the F1 and F2 nanofibers. The relatively low degree of hydrolysis in PVA25-80 hinders its dissolution in water. Therefore, the initial dissolution of PBC from nanofibers prepared with PVA25-80 was considered slow-release. The PBC dissolution rate of nanofibers prepared using fully hydrolyzed PVA17-98 (F4) was only 3% after 24 h; the nanofiber mats were not completely dissolved and remained in the vessel. This may be explained by the high PBC crystallinity in F4 (Fig. 2c) as well as the additional hydrogen bonds between PVA chains in fully hydrolyzed PVAs, which prevent disintegration in water. The dissolution behaviors of drug-loaded PVA nanofibers depended on the PVA properties, such as degrees of hydrolysis and polymerization, highlighting the possibility for tailoring drug release from nanofibers according to PVA grades. PVA nanofibers with higher PBC contents were prepared using PVA 24–88, which improved PBC solubility the most (Fig. 3a), and the effect of PBC content on drug dissolution was evaluated (Fig. 3b). The F7 formulation with up to 30% PBC content in the nanofibers exhibited a lower drug dissolution rate compared to F1 (11% PBC) and F6 (20% PBC). The PXRD and DSC results showed that PBC in PVA nanofibers was in an amorphous state regardless of the PBC content ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The wettability of PVA nanofibers may have decreased when the content of the hydrophobic drug (PBC) increased, reducing the dissolution rate. The PBC concentration in the dissolution test vessel is 5.56 μg/mL, which corresponds to 100% dissolution in the dissolution test figures. The solubility of PBCs in the dissolution test medium (0.1% P80 solution) was 0.53 ± 0.24 μg/mL ( Supplementary Methods ). In the dissolution test profile, dissolved PBC is likely to be supersaturated above 9.53% PBC dissolution in the medium. PBC released from PVA nanofibers retained an elevated level of supersaturation in most PVA nanofibers evaluated for PBC dissolution in this study. The typical “spring and parachute” release behavior, where the rate of dissolution decreases over time due to precipitation of dissolved API, was not observed. Thus, PBC molecules were gradually released from the nanofibers by the dissolution-controlled mechanism of the soluble PVA carrier or the diffusion-controlled mechanism of the drug molecules in the PVA nanofiber matrix. The gradual accumulation of dissolved PBCs in the medium may have maintained supersaturation without an obvious dissolution decline. It is also possible that the locally high PVA concentration in the fiber mat prevented API precipitation and crystallization during the dissolution process, maintaining local supersaturation [12]."
11,Effect of o/w emulsion solvent on PBC dissolution from nanofibers,"3.3 Effect of o/w emulsion solvent on PBC dissolution from nanofibers The effect of the o/w emulsion solvent used to prepare PVA nanofibers containing 30% PBC on drug dissolution from nanofibers was evaluated (Fig. 4 ). Ethyl acetate (F7), isopropyl acetate (F8), butyl acetate (F9), and isobutyl acetate (F10), which are immiscible with water, were used as solvents. From smallest to largest, the average particle size in each o/w emulsion was 276 nm (ethyl acetate) < 344 nm (isopropyl acetate) < 499 nm (isobutyl acetate) < 520 nm (butyl acetate), as shown in Supplementary Table 1. SEM images of PBC-containing PVA nanofibers prepared from each o/w emulsion by electrospinning are shown in Fig. 4a–d. The smallest fiber diameter was attained using F7, which was prepared using ethyl acetate and had the smallest emulsion particle size. Some bumps were observed on the fiber surface regardless of which organic solvent was used. The PBC crystallinity in F7–F10 nanofibers was evaluated by PXRD and DSC, revealing that PBC was present in an amorphous state regardless of the organic solvent used (Supplementary Fig. 3). Comparing drug dissolutions among PVA nanofibers prepared using different solvents (Fig. 4e), PBC dissolution decreased when butyl acetate (F9) and isobutyl acetate (F10) were used. Domokos et al. reported that using dimethylformamide (153 °C boiling point) to prepare PVP nanofibers by electrospinning produced nanofibers with some residual solvent (∼2,000 ppm) [31]. Therefore, using solvents with high boiling points (>100 °C), such as butyl acetate (126 °C boiling point) and isobutyl acetate (118 °C boiling point), may produce nanofibers with slight solvent residues, which could affect the wettability of PVA nanofibers and, consequently, reduce PBS solubility."
12,Effect of including a surfactant in the o/w emulsion on PVA nanofiber characteristics,"3.4 Effect of including a surfactant in the o/w emulsion on PVA nanofiber characteristics As shown in Fig. 3b, the drug dissolution rate of PVA nanofibers decreased when the PBC content in the nanofibers was increased to 30%. Delayed dissolution of nanofibers with higher PBC contents may be caused by reduced dispersibility of the drug molecules. To achieve homogeneous drug dispersion in PVA nanofibers, we added a surfactant emulsifier (P80) to the o/w emulsion and examined the effects on the physical properties of the nanofibers as well as drug dissolution. PVA nanofibers were electrospun from PBC-containing o/w emulsions with P80 concentrations of 0.1% (F11), 0.5% (F12), and 1.0% (F13). Fig. 5 a shows the particle size distribution of o/w emulsions measured by DLS, which decreased with increasing P80 concentration. The effect of P80 on the surface morphology of PBC-containing PVA nanofibers was evaluated via SEM (Fig. 5b–d). As shown in Fig. 1f, the surface of PVA nanofibers containing 30% PBC without P80 (F7) was uneven, but adding P80 produced PVA nanofibers with smooth surfaces. To evaluate the oil phase dispersion in the o/w emulsion, PBC-containing PVA nanofibers were prepared with the addition of a hydrophobic fluorescent substance (C6) to the oil phase (ethyl acetate) (Fig. 6 ). CLSM observations showed a decrease in the dispersibility of C6 in the PVA nanofibers with increasing drug content from 11% to 30%. In the F7 formulation with 30% PBC, C6-derived fluorescence was observed in discontinuous spots rather than homogeneously throughout the nanofiber. In contrast, C6 fluorescence was homogeneously dispersed in F13 nanofibers prepared with P80, suggesting that the presence of P80 as an emulsifier could enhance drug dispersion in PVA nanofibers. The effects of P80 surfactant on drug crystallinity and dissolution properties in PBC-containing PVA nanofibers were also investigated (Fig. 7 ). The crystallinity of PBC-loaded PVA nanofibers containing different concentrations of P80 was evaluated using PXRD and DSC. PBC-containing nanofibers prepared from F7 and F11–F13 formulations showed halo PXRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. 4). DSC results from PBC-containing PVA nanofibers without P80 showed no PBC melting peaks (Fig. 7a); however, melting peaks were observed in the DSC profiles of nanofibers prepared with P80. The PBC melting point was lowered in PVA nanofibers containing P80 compared with that of untreated PBC original, suggesting that some PBC exists as nanocrystals in these fibers (Gibbs–Thomson effect). The enthalpy (ΔH) calculated from the area of endothermic peak increased with increasing P80 concentrations [F11 (1.64 mJ/mg) < F12 (6.08 mJ/mg) < F13 (11.16 mJ/mg)], indicating that P80 increased the crystallinity of PBC in PVA nanofibers. Although PBC was partially crystallized, P80-incorporated PVA nanofibers showed higher PBC dissolution rates than those without P80, in which PBC was amorphous. The improvement in PBC dissolution was dependent on P80 concentration (Fig. 7b). In the process of emulsion electrospinning with surfactants, it has been reported that some surfactants may migrate from the emulsion droplet interface and distribute on the fiber surface [28]. Therefore, the presence of P80 near the surface of the nanofibers may have decreased the surface tension and improved the hydrophilicity and wettability of PVA nanofibers, improving the solubility and release of PBC."
13,Comparison of drug-loaded PVP and PVA nanofiber characteristics,"3.5 Comparison of drug-loaded PVP and PVA nanofiber characteristics PBC-containing nanofibers were prepared using PVP, a versatile matrix polymer for solid dispersions, for comparison with PVA nanofibers. As PVP is soluble in water and ethanol, PBC-containing PVP nanofibers can be prepared by electrospinning in a single step without emulsification (Fig. 8 ). PVP nanofibers with different PBC contents (F14–F16) were obtained by electrospinning (Table 3). In PVA emulsions in which the continuous phase is water, PVA nanofibers can be continuously prepared for a long time in a single-axis spinneret electrospinning system. However, the PVP/PBC ethanol solution was sprayed from a single nozzle in our electrospinning system, and PVP/PBC gradually precipitated at the nozzle tip, hindering continuous electrospinning for more than 1 h. The variation in fiber diameter of PVP nanofibers was greater than that of PVA nanofibers (Fig. 6a–c); some very thin fibers were observed in the SEM images of PVP nanofibers (Fig. 8a and b). PBC crystallinity in PVP nanofibers was evaluated by DSC (Fig. 8d). In F14 and F15 PVP nanofibers, there was no melting peak, indicating that PBC was in an amorphous state. In the PVP nanofiber containing 31.8% PBC (F16), an endothermic peak was observed, suggesting that some PBC was crystallized in the PVP nanofiber. The dissolution of PBC-containing PVP nanofibers was evaluated, and it was found that PVP nanofibers improved the dissolution of PBC (Fig. 8e). PVP nanofibers with the highest PBC content (F16) showed lower dissolution compared to F14 and F15 due to PBC crystallization. Since the PVA nanofibers containing 30% PBC (F7) were amorphous (Fig. 7a), PVA may be preferable over PVP as a solid dispersion carrier to initiate PBC/polymer interaction and retain the amorphous state with high PBC loading. PVP nanofibers showed rapid PBC dissolution, in contrast to PVA nanofibers with sustained-release profiles (Fig. 3b). When the PVP nanofiber solid dispersion was placed in water, the fibers dissolved immediately after the fibers absorbed water, resulting in an initial burst release of the drug. Thus, the dissolution properties of polymeric nanofibers are affected by the water solubility of the carriers. In PVA nanofibers, the absorbed water molecules readily displaced the drug molecules in the polymer matrix during the swelling of the PVA fibers, releasing the drug into the dissolution medium in a sustained-release pattern [12]."
14,Conclusions,"PVA nanofibers prepared from o/w emulsions were suitable solid dispersions that can potentially enhance the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. The effects of degrees of hydrolysis and polymerization of PVA on the physical properties of PBC-containing PVA nanofibers were evaluated. Among the tested PVA grades, highly polymerized and partially hydrolyzed PVA24-88 was proven to be particularly effective for preparing PBC nanofibers and improving solubility. PVA nanofibers with a PBC content of 30% were less soluble than PVA nanofibers with lower PBC contents. However, the incorporation of a surfactant (P80) as an emulsifier resulted in uniform dispersion of PBC in PVA nanofibers and improved PBC dissolution. Polymeric nanofibers can be tailored based on the characteristics of PVA, representing a promising advanced solid dispersion drug delivery system for poorly water-soluble drugs."
