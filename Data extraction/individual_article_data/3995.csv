0,Introduction,"Food waste is a public nuisance. Large amounts of food waste are generated all over the world; for example, 234 kg of food is wasted per capita in the UK every year (Salemdeeb et al., 2017). Most food waste is disposed of in landfills, incinerated, or recycled via composting and anaerobic digestion (Lee et al., 2020a; Salemdeeb et al., 2017). However, discarding food waste in landfill releases large quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs); hence, this practice has recently come under strict regulation by several governments (Lee et al., 2007; Manfredi et al., 2009). Incineration and composting can also lead to the emission of GHGs (Ermolaev et al., 2014; Melikoglu et al., 2013), and anaerobic digestion generates wastewater that causes acidification and eutrophication in local ecosystems (Xu et al., 2018). It is therefore crucial for adequate food waste disposal technology to be developed and utilized (Cha and Um, 2020). Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable natural resource that is inedible (i.e., 2nd generation biomass) (Dikshit et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019b) and is therefore common in various types of waste such as agricultural residues, forestry residues, and municipal solid waste (Jung et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2015). The utilization of food waste and lignocellulosic biomass as a value-added resource has received increasing interest, which has led to the development of a variety of methods and techniques by which these products can be reused (Lin et al., 2013). Of the various methods studied, pyrolysis, which is a thermochemical process that converts carbonaceous substances (such as biomass and biowaste) into non-condensable gases, pyrolytic oil (e.g., bio-oil), and solid char under anerobic and dry conditions (Kwon et al., 2018; Lam et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2021), represents an effective process for achieving both the valorization (Kim et al., 2020b; Kwon et al., 2019) and the disposal of waste (Yek et al., 2019). Bio-oil is generally targeted as a product of pyrolysis because it is an alternative liquid fuel (Lee et al., 2020b). Solid char is used not only as a solid fuel (Kim et al., 2015) but also as a carbon material that has been applied in various applications such as environmental remediation (Lam et al., 2019a, 2020), catalysis (Kwon et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020c, 2020d), and storage of energy (Azwar et al., 2018). Pyrolytic gases (i.e., non-condensable gases) can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines (Hossain and Davies, 2013). Pyrolysis is commonly utilized for the valorization of carbonaceous feedstocks; however, it is also effective for the clean disposal of biowaste, both by reducing the volume of waste and by minimizing the generation of harmful compounds such as benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Kim et al., 2020a, 2020c; Kim and Lee, 2020). Pyrolysis can be carried out with two or more feedstocks; co-pyrolysis has been demonstrated to improve the quantity and quality of bio-oil without the requirement for additional modifications to the pyrolysis system. For example, the co-pyrolysis of rice husk with microalgae (Enteromorpha prolifera) increased the yield of biochar by 26% over that achieved with pyrolysis using only rice husk (Uzoejinwa et al., 2019). The co-pyrolysis of rice husk with other forms of biomass, such as wheat straw or peanut shells, was observed to decrease the water content of the bio-oil by up to 15% compared with that obtained via the pyrolysis of rice husk alone (Fermanelli et al., 2020). The rapid catalytic co-pyrolysis of rice straw with waste oil improved the selectivity of BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) to 70% (Zhang et al., 2019) and the co-pyrolysis of bamboo waste with amino acids (glutamic acid or aspartic acid) decreased the temperature at which the biomass decomposed, decreasing the content of N-containing species in the bio-oil by 50% (Chen et al., 2019). Furthermore, co-pyrolysis has a higher ratio of performance to cost than other bio-oil upgrading processes such as catalytic cracking or hydrodeoxygenation (Abnisa and Wan Daud, 2014). This study aimed to examine the feasibility of co-pyrolysis as a method, not only for the clean disposal of waste products, but also for the effective utilization of food waste and lignocellulosic biomass. Wood bark was used as a lignocellulosic biomass surrogate. Although many previous studies have dealt with the co-pyrolysis of food waste with biomass feedstocks, most have only considered single-phase pyrolytic products (e.g., bio-oil or biochar). However, to assess the practicality of pyrolysis for the value-added utilization of waste substances, more systematic studies must be conducted using the same experimental apparatus to analyze pyrolytic products existing in three different phases (gas, liquid, and solid). The detailed identification, quantification, and characterization of all the three-phase pyrolytic products were therefore conducted in this study. The effects of the parameters involved in co-pyrolysis, such as the flow rate of the pyrolysis medium, the pyrolysis temperature, and the ratio at which food waste was combined with wood bark on the pyrolytic products were also investigated. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of strategies that can be used to achieve the simultaneous clean disposal and valorization of biowaste."
1,Experimental section,
2,Feedstocks,"2.1 Feedstocks The food waste was provided by a waste treatment plant located in Seoul, Republic of Korea. WB (lignocellulosic biomass) was obtained from a furniture factory located in Suwon, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea. The food waste was dewatered via screw pressing. Foreign matter in the food waste was then separated using a magnet, after which both the food waste and the wood bark were dried at 60 °C for 1 d. The food waste and wood bark were then ground to produce particles of 0.6–1.0 mm (Fig. S1). For the pyrolysis experiments, five different feedstocks were prepared by mixing the food waste with the wood bark in the following proportions: (1) food waste only (denoted as FW); (2) wood bark only (denoted as WB); (3) a mixture of food waste and wood bark with a weight ratio of 3:1 (denoted as FW3-WB1); (4) a mixture of food waste and wood bark with a weight ratio of 1:1 (denoted as FW1-WB1); and (5) a mixture of food waste and wood bark with a weight ratio of 1:3 (denoted as FW1-WB3). Proximate analysis of the food waste and lignocellulosic biomass was performed by measuring the moisture content (105 °C for 1 d in an open-top porcelain crucible), volatile matter (450 °C for 1 h in a covered porcelain crucible), and ash (750 °C for 1 h in an open-top porcelain crucible). The fixed matter content was calculated by subtracting the sum of the moisture, volatile matter, and ash contents from the initial weight of the sample. A muffle furnace (model: FHX-05; DAIHAN Scientific Co., Ltd., Wonju, Gangwon, Republic of Korea) was used for the proximate analysis. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents of the food waste and wood bark were characterized using the method used in (Mansor et al., 2019). The elemental composition (C, H, N, and S) of the food waste and lignocellulosic biomass was determined by combusting the sample at 1000 °C with tungstic anhydride and copper wire catalysts. The oxygen (O) content was estimated by subtracting the sum of the C, H, N, and S contents from 100%. An elemental analyzer (model: FlashSmart 2000; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for the ultimate analysis."
3,Pyrolysis experiments,"2.2 Pyrolysis experiments A continuous-flow pyrolysis reactor was built to carry out the co-pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark. The pyrolysis experimental setup consisted of a quartz tubular reactor (with an inner diameter of 21 mm, outer diameter of 25 mm, and a length of 600 mm), a mass flow controller (model: 3660 Series; KOFLOC, Kyoto, Japan), a hinged tube furnace equipped with a temperature controller (model: HTF-Q60; Hantech Co., Ltd., Gunpo, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea), a cold trap composed of an ice bath (maintained at −1 °C), and a dry ice/acetone bath (maintained at −50 °C). Feedstock (1 g) was loaded onto an alumina boat that was located at the center of the tubular reactor. Ultra-high purity nitrogen (N2) gas supplied by DK gas (Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea) was used to create an oxygen-free environment during pyrolysis. The flow rate of the N2 gas was controlled by a mass flow controller. The experimental setup for the pyrolysis is depicted in Fig. S2. To ensure the reproducibility of the experimental data, each experiment was conducted in triplicate."
4,Pyrolytic product analysis,"2.3 Pyrolytic product analysis The pyrolytic products in all three phases (i.e., non-condensable gas, oil, and residual solid) were characterized in this study. The non-condensable gases were identified and quantified using a micro GC (model: Fusion Gas Analyzer; INFICON, Bad Ragaz, Switzerland) that was connected in situ to the outlet of the reactor. Detailed conditions for the micro GC analysis are given in Table S1. The condensable chemical species collected by the cold trap were identified and quantified using a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) (GC model: 7890A; MS model: 5975C; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) that was equipped with an HP-5MS Ultra Inert column (part number: 19091S-433UI; dimensions: diameter of 0.25 mm, length of 30 m, and film thickness of 0.25 μm). Each GC–MS peak was identified using the NIST mass spectral library. The identified peaks were integrated, and the mass of each species was calculated based on the internal standard 5-methylfurfural (10 ng mL−1), which was used because it was not detected in any of the samples obtained from the pyrolysis. Detailed conditions for the GC–MS analysis are provided in Table S2. The surface area and porosity of the residual solid products were measured via N2 physisorption at −196 °C using an ASAP 2020 system (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., Norcross, GA, USA). Prior to the physisorption measurement, heating was carried out at 90 °C for 30 min and then at 150 °C in vacuum to degas the sample. The surface area and porosity of the sample were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) desorption methods. The total pore volume of the sample was determined at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99. The distribution of pore sizes in the sample was determined using the non-local density functional theory (NL-DFT), assuming that the pores were slit-shaped."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the food waste and wood bark,"3.1 Characterization of the food waste and wood bark Proximate analysis was conducted to describe the food waste and wood bark in terms of water content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash. Table 1 a shows the results of the proximate analysis and lignin contents of the food waste and wood bark. Significant difference was observed in the ash contents of the food waste (10.3 wt%) and wood bark (1.3 wt%). The contents of the food waste and wood bark were recorded in terms of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S), as seen in Table 1b. The table indicates that high levels of oxygen were present in both the food waste and the wood bark (approximately 42 wt%), alongside similar carbon and hydrogen contents. The nitrogen content of the food waste (3.9 wt%) was significantly higher than that of the wood bark (0.2 wt%). The difference in the nitrogen contents of the two samples was likely due to the presence of protein in the food waste (Abdul Samad et al., 2017). The food waste also included low levels of sulfur (0.4 wt%), which was not detected in the wood bark. The proportions of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives in the food waste and wood bark were identified and are listed in Table 1c, together with low amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (total 3.3 wt%). The contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in the wood bark were 40.1, 22.5, and 28.3 wt%, respectively. Extractives consisting of lipids, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, amino acids, phosphates, and other minor organic and inorganic species have also been observed in waste (Karmee and Lin, 2014; Mansor et al., 2019). Food waste is a well-known non-edible source of lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and phosphates (Pleissner et al., 2013, 2014), with a high content of extractives (96.7 wt%). The wood bark contained only 9.1 wt% of extractives. The extractives present in biomass are responsible for its smell, color, and durability (Rowell, 2013)."
7,Analysis of pyrolytic products,"3.2 Analysis of pyrolytic products The effect that the flow rate of the N2 gas has on the pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark was initially investigated by examining the process with the three different N2 flow rates of 100, 200, and 300 mL min−1 at steady states. However, no marked changes in the compositions or yields of the pyrolytic products were observed as a result of changing the flow rate. Thus, the N2 flow rate of 100 mL min−1 was used in other experiments aimed at investigating the effects of the other pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis parameters such as temperature and the blending ratio of food waste to wood bark. In this study, we attempted to provide a mass balance between the feedstock and all the compounds identified in the pyrolytic products. In other words, we intended to ascertain how much of the feedstock (weight basis; unit: μg gfeedstock −1) is converted into an individual compound. The results are presented in Table S3. Information about the chemical compounds identified (molecular weight, chemical formula, and chemical structure) is provided in Table S4. A total of 204 chemical species were identified, including 8 non-condensable gaseous compounds (entries 1 to 8 in Tables S3) and 196 condensable compounds (entries 9 to 204 in Tables S3 and S4). The non-condensable gases that were identified in the pyrolytic products included hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), alkanes such as methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), and propane (C3H8), and alkenes such as ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6). The condensable species were classified as phenolic compounds, PAHs and their derivatives, linear hydrocarbons, non-linear hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, amides, amines, nitriles, furans, indoles, pyrans, and carbohydrate compounds, among others."
8,Gaseous pyrolytic products,"3.3 Gaseous pyrolytic products Fig. 1 shows the yields of non-condensable gaseous compounds that were identified in the pyrolytic products obtained from the combination of food waste with wood bark at different ratios as a function of the pyrolysis temperature. In terms of weight, CO2 was the prominent permanent gas produced by the pyrolysis of all five feedstocks, with CO being the second highest. As the proportion of wood bark increased, the yield of CO increased and the yield of CO2 decreased. The yields of both CO and CO2 were observed to increase as the pyrolysis temperature increased. The ratio of food waste to wood bark also affected the yields of alkanes, alkenes, and H2; with more alkanes and alkenes produced as the ratio increased. However, the yield of H2 was highest at a food waste/wood bark ratio of 1 (i.e., FW1-WB1) at all temperatures tested. The total yield of non-condensable gases increased for all five feedstocks as the pyrolysis temperature increased. For example, the total non-condensable gas yield achieved with the FW1-WB1 feedstock increased from 62 700 to 175 300 μg gfeedstock −1 as the temperature increased from 300 °C to 700 °C. This can likely be attributed to the enhanced thermal cracking of condensable vapor via the heterogeneous reactions occurring in the gas–solid phase and the homogeneous reactions occurring in the gas phase as the temperature increases (Hossain et al., 2016; Nasir Uddin et al., 2013). Of the non-condensable pyrolytic gases, H2 is considered a clean renewable fuel because it has a much greater heating value than fossil fuels such as coal, gasoline, and methane, while the combustion of H2 gas generates few air pollutants. Pyrolysis is advantageous over other processes for the production of gaseous H2 owing to its simplicity and fuel adaptability (Uddin et al., 2014). Fig. 2 shows the yield of H2 gas produced via the co-pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark as a function of the weight ratio of FW/WB and the pyrolysis temperature. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the H2 yield increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. This is expected because higher pyrolysis temperatures enhance the decomposition of the vaporized species that are emitted from the feedstock during pyrolysis (Hossain et al., 2016). At all temperatures tested, the co-pyrolysis of food waste with wood bark produced more H2 than the pyrolysis of food waste or wood bark alone. The highest yield of H2 was obtained with the FW1-WB1 feedstock. This indicates that pyrolyzing food waste and wood bark together can increase the production of H2 gas. The higher heating value (HHV) of the pyrolytic gaseous products was calculated based on the heat of the combustion of each gas and the amount of gaseous products generated, the results of which are given in Table S3. As the pyrolysis temperature was increased, the HHV increased owing to the generation of more combustible gases. For example, the HHV increased from 2.9 to 11 MJ kg−1 as the temperature of the FW1-WB1 feedstock increased from 300 °C to 700 °C. The pyrolytic gases produced via the ratios FW1-WB1 and FW1-FW3 demonstrated the highest HHVs of the tested feedstocks. For example, the HHV of the pyrolytic gaseous products derived from the co-pyrolysis of FW1-WB1 and FW1-FW3 at 700 °C reached a maximum of 12 MJ kg−1."
9,Liquid-pyrolytic products,"3.4 Liquid-pyrolytic products Fig. 3 summarizes the results for the condensable compounds according to the classification. The yield of acids was the highest in feedstocks involving FW (e.g., FW, FW3-WB1, and FW1-WB1), with fatty acids being predominantly produced (palmitoleic acid, caprylic acid, petroselaidic acid, elaidic acid, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, linoleic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid), as can be seen in Tables S3 and S4. The fatty acid yields increased as the fraction of food waste in the feedstock increased because these fatty acids are commonly found in foodstuffs such as vegetable oils, fish, eggs, meat, and the products made using these ingredients. Resin acids such as dehydroabietic acid, which are commonly found in tree resins, were predominant in the feedstocks that included significant amounts of WB (e.g., FW1-WB1 and WB). The esters (entries 145 to 157) may have been generated via the transesterification of the fatty acids. Oxygenated compounds other than acids, including alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones, are commonly found in bio-oil produced via biomass pyrolysis (Diebold, 2000; Kim et al., 2019a). If pyrolytic liquid is to be used as a liquid fuel, the content of oxygenated species in the pyrolytic liquid needs to be reduced in order to improve the quality of the fuel. In addition to co-pyrolysis, microwave heating has recently been proven as an effective method for reducing the oxygen content in bio-oils derived from different feedstocks and their mixtures (Lam et al., 2019c; Wan Mahari et al., 2018). As seen in Fig. 3, the yield of phenolic compounds (entries 9 to 58) increased while that of acids decreased as the proportion of wood bark in the feedstock increased. This was most likely due to the fact that wood bark has a much higher lignin content than food waste (Table 1a). In addition, the yields of phenolic compounds achieved at 300 °C using all five feedstocks were much lower than those achieved at the other temperatures. For example, the phenolic compound yield achieved at 400 °C was approximately 11 times higher than that achieved at 300 °C when FW1-WB3 was subjected to co-pyrolysis. This is because the decomposition of the polymeric structure of lignin into chemical species with phenolic –OH groups begins to decompose at approximately 400 °C (Brebu and Vasile, 2010; Rodrigues et al., 2001). Several PAHs and their derivatives (entries 59–66) were identified in the pyrolytic products. These can be generated from phenolic compounds and other benzene derivatives via hydrogen atom abstraction, acetylene addition, and the Diels–Alder mechanism (Kislov et al., 2005). Cyclic compounds (entries 75–80, 84, and 85) can be produced via the dehydrogenation of linear hydrocarbons (Richter and Howard, 2000). Cholesta-3,5-diene (entry 81), stigmastan-3,5-diene (entry 82), stigmast-3,4-diene (entry 83), stigmast-5-en-3-ol (entries 92 and 94), and cholest-5-en-3-ol (entry 93) are produced via the high-temperature (>150 °C) reactions of β-sitosterol, which is a plant sterol that has a chemical structure similar to cholesterol (Aparicio and Aparicio-Ruı́z, 2000; Cert et al., 2000; Moreda et al., 2001). The furans (entries 172–179), indoles (entries 180–183), and pyrans (entries 184–187) likely originated from the cellulose that was contained in the feedstock (Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2015). Phenolic compounds and PAH derivatives accounted for 5%–55% of the identified condensable species. Phenols and their derivatives are potentially carcinogenic and can be toxic or lethal to fish at low concentrations (Abha and Singh, 2012). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has designated phenol and phenolic compounds as priority pollutants taking 11th place in a list of 126 undesirable chemicals (Raza et al., 2019; Yahaya et al., 2019). PAHs and their derivatives have mutagenic and carcinogenic capacities, are damaging to internal organs such as the kidney and liver, and cause heart diseases (Kim et al., 2013). In addition, reactions between PAHs and ozone and nitrogen oxides can lead to the formation of particulate oxygenated-PAHs, which are considered secondary organic aerosols (Lee et al., 2018). Fig. 4 shows the yields of phenolic compounds and PAH derivatives that are produced through the co-pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark as functions of the weight ratio of FW/WB and the pyrolysis temperature. As presented in Fig. 4, an increase in the pyrolysis temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C at the same FW/WB ratio tended to increase the yield of phenols. A further increase in the temperature from 500 °C to 700 °C decreased the yields of both phenols and PAHs. It is known that the formation of PAHs favors high temperatures (Sharma and Hajaligol, 2003) and phenolic compounds are more easily transformed into PAH derivatives at high temperatures. The yields of phenols and PAH derivatives were observed to increase as the amount of wood bark in the feedstock increased. This was likely due to the higher lignin content in the wood bark (Table 1a). However, the extent to which the formation of phenols and PAHs is enhanced by decreasing the fraction of food waste in the feedstock from 1 to 0.5 was not as significant as that of decreasing the fraction of food waste in the feedstock from 0.5 to 0. For example, at 700 °C (at which temperature the most H2 gas was produced), the yield of phenolic compounds and PAH derivatives increased by only 2.3% when the fraction of food waste in the feedstock was decreased to 0.5. However, the yield increased by 47.9% when the proportion of food waste was further decreased from 0.5 to 0. This indicated that combining the food waste and wood bark at a weight ratio of 1:1 allows a gradual increase in the formation of phenolic compounds and PAH derivatives (Fig. 4 )."
10,Solid pyrolytic products,"3.5 Solid pyrolytic products The nonvolatile carbon-rich solids that remain after pyrolysis (i.e., char) can be applied in a variety of applications such as fuel and structural materials. Characterizing the chars produced from the different combinations of FW and WB is beneficial in order to ascertain the potential use of the materials. The yields of char produced with the five different feedstocks at different temperatures were therefore compared (Fig. 5 ). The yields of char that were obtained from the five feedstocks at the same temperature did not differ significantly based on Student’ s t-test with a confidence level of 95%. The char yield was highest at 300 °C for all feedstocks; however, this decreased rapidly when the pyrolysis temperature was increased to above 300 °C. At pyrolysis temperatures higher than 300 °C, the cleavage of the C–H and –OH groups is enhanced (Li et al., 2018), leading to the release of more volatile compounds into gas and liquid fractions of the pyrolytic product (Demirbas, 2004). This might result in a decrease in the char yield. The chars that were produced at 300 °C were therefore considered for further characterization. The surface area, total pore volume, and mean pore diameter of the chars produced at 300 °C are listed in Table 2 , and the distributions of their pore size are shown in Fig. 6 . The pore size distribution determined by the NL-DFT method covers ranges of approximately 1.3–13.8 and 18.4–29 nm. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6, while the mean pore diameters of the chars derived from the five feedstocks were not significantly different, the surface area and porosity were enhanced in the order: WB > FW1-WB1 > FW1-WB3 > FW > FW3-WB1. Given that the removal of residual volatiles from the char results in enhancing the surface area and porosity of the char (Antunes et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2017), the co-pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark can be considered helpful in releasing more volatile species from the char than the pyrolysis of food waste or wood bark alone, while possibly allowing modification of the char properties. The results of the proximate and ultimate analyses of the chars made from different feedstocks are given in Table S5. Table 3 summarizes the HHVs of the chars made from different feedstocks, which were estimated based on the elemental composition of the chars (Table S5b) using an empirical equation available in the literature (Jenkins and Ekanayake, 2017). The chars had an HHV of between 22.7 and 23.8 MJ kg−1. Given that the HHV of coal varies between 16 and 26 MJ kg−1 (Tan et al., 2015), the HHVs of the chars means that these products could be considered reasonable for utilization as solid fuel."
11,Conclusions,"To design a strategy for the clean disposal and valorization of biowaste, the co-pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark (a surrogate feedstock for lignocellulosic biomass) was studied using a continuous-flow pyrolysis reactor that allowed the in situ collection and analysis of the gaseous, liquid, and solid pyrolytic products. A total of 204 different chemical species were identified and quantified in the non-condensable and condensable pyrolytic products. The flow rate of the N2 did not significantly affect the characteristics of the pyrolytic products, while the temperature and the FW/WB ratio greatly affected the yields of the pyrolytic products. Higher temperatures led to the production of more non-condensable gases and less char. The highest H2 yield was achieved with a gradual increase in the yield of phenolic compounds and PAH derivatives using the FW1-WB1 feedstock. Using the FW1-WB1 feedstock derived a char material with relatively high porosity compared to the other combinations of food waste and wood bark. The results of this study suggest that the co-pyrolysis of food waste and lignocellulosic biomass at the appropriate ratio aids in the production of H2 by minimizing the formation of harmful pollutants such as phenols and PAHs. This highlights the potential of co-pyrolysis for producing H2 while limiting the formation of chemical species that are harmful to the environment and human health. Thus, the co-pyrolysis of food waste and lignocellulosic biomass shows considerable potential for application as a technological alternative, not only to ease environmental burdens, but also to provide a promising solution for the production of hydrogen fuels."
