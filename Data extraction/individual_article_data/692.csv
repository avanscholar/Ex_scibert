0,Introduction,"The use of CO2 as a feedstock for producing chemicals has received considerable attention over the past decades [1]. There can be several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2, the main ones being the low cost of CO2 (especially considering CO2 emission taxes), the non-toxicity of the compound, and the impact on the global carbon balance. Although it may not have a major impact on the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, using CO2 as a feedstock is considered an integral part of carbon management. The major issue when trying to convert CO2 is the relative thermodynamic stability of this molecule. Thus, the conversion of CO2 to other chemicals will require energy [2]. There are several options to supply this energy, such as the use of high free energy content chemicals or the use of an external source of energy [3]. Nature uses the process of photosynthesis exploiting the visible light energy from the sun to produce carbohydrates. In all cases, a suitable catalyst has to be used to enhance the reaction rate of the selective pathway. One route for converting CO2 into chemicals is the reaction of CO2 with hydrogen on a copper based catalyst or modified methanol catalyst to form alcohols, especially methanol [4]. This is a well known reaction which recently attracted new interest because of the potential role of methanol in a future hydrogen economy. Recently, a paper has been published describing the methanol synthesis from H2 and CO2 on a Mo6S8 cluster using density functional theory [5]. For many years it was believed that carbon dioxide simply reduces to carbon monoxide [6] and from that point on follows the “standard” syngas chemistry of hydrogen and carbon monoxide [7]. However, recent experiments with isotopic labeling have indicated that methanol synthesis from CO and H2 proceeds through the intermediate step of CO2 formation by the water gas shift reaction followed by CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, at least on the standard copper based catalysts [3,8]. It was proven that direct CO hydrogenation to methanol does not take place on copper based catalysts [9,10]. There is interest in developing alternative routes for the production of ethylene and propylene. One of these routes runs via the formation of C2 and C3 alcohols as intermediate. In the base case idea, syngas is used as a feed. The syngas is reacted to ethanol and propanol, which are subsequently converted into ethylene and propylene. CO2 and hydrocarbons are considered to be the major by-products of this process. The co-produced methanol can be recycled, sold separately, or converted into olefins via an MTO type process. The syngas to alcohols process has been a topic of research since the early nineteen eighties. Dow has developed a cobalt molybdenum sulfide based catalyst that is able to convert syngas into a mixture of alcohols (mainly methanol, ethanol, and propanol) [11–16]. Details on the preparation of this catalyst are provided in the next section and in the patents mentioned. Recently, it was discovered that the CoMoS based catalyst is also capable of producing a mixed alcohols product mixture when using CO2 and H2 as a feed instead of syngas. The results of this work are described in the current publication. In practice, a process where CO2 and H2 are converted into alcohols/olefins is economically viable only if the hydrogen can be obtained in a cost effective manner. Conventional on-purpose routes to make H2 are energy intensive, which would have a negative impact on process economics."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A coprecipitated cobalt/molybdenum sulfide is prepared. Two solutions, one of (NH4)2MoS4 and one of Co(CH3CO2)2, are added simultaneously and dropwise to a stirred solution of aqueous acid. After stirring the reaction mix is filtered and the filter cake dried and then calcined at elevated temperature. The calcined cobalt/molybdenum sulfide is ground together with a clay, alkali salt, and lubricant and pelletized. For further details, the reader is referred to the following references: [14,15]."
3,Catalyst characterization,The catalyst characterization details are provided in Table 1 .
4,Test unit details,3.1 Test unit details The experiments are performed in a fixed bed reactor tube with a 0.95cm outside (0.70cm inside) tube diameter equipped with a sand bath for temperature control. The top and the bottom of the tube contain a layer of inert ceramic beads. The catalyst is crushed and sieved between 1.18mm and 1.78mm and approximately 260g of catalyst without diluent is loaded in between the two inert zones. The reactor tube is loaded into the sand bath and connected to the feed inlet and product exit lines. The total jacketed length is 1.83m and 30cm of outside tubing. There are two heated zones with two 1500W heaters per zone. The temperature is controlled by one thermocouple per zone placed in the sand bath. Both on the top and on the bottom 15cm of the inert ceramic beads section extends outside of the heated jacket area. H2S is co-fed during the experiments to compensate for any sulfur loss of the catalyst. In a typical experiment the H2S concentration is maintained at 50ppm. The total feed gas mixture is preheated at 270°C throughout the reactions.
5,Results,"Conversion and selectivities are calculated based upon on-line GC analysis of the inlet and outlet streams using an internal standard. Conversion is calculated in the following way: CO2 conversion=(CO2 inlet flow [mol/h]−CO2 outlet flow [mol/h])/CO2 inlet flow [mol/h]∗100% H2 conversion=(H2 inlet flow [mol/h]−H2 outlet flow [mol/h])/H2 inlet flow [mol/h]∗100%. The carbon and product based selectivity is calculated as the molar fraction of the component in the total product carbon stream, weighed by its number of carbon atoms. Four experiments were done in which the H2/CO2 ratio was varied between 1 and 3 and the temperature was varied between 310°C and 340°C. The pressure was kept constant at 103bar. The aim was to keep the WHSV constant at 0.5h−1, however there was a slight variation between 0.43 and 0.6h−1. The results are summarized in Table 2 . After changing process conditions, the catalyst was held at these conditions for a certain period of time until stable results were observed, before moving on to the next set of parameters. Hence, the data in the table are the results at stabilized activity, not at initial activity. Unfortunately, the GC method used did not allow for water to be detected."
6,Discussion,"If one assumes that the production of alcohols and alkanes does not occur via the direct hydrogenation of CO2, but rather through hydrogenation of CO, the reactions can be divided in three main classes: the reverse water gas shift reaction (r-WGS), the alcohol formation reaction, and the Fischer–Tropsch reaction: Reverse water gas shift reaction (1) CO2 +H2 ↔CO+H2O Alcohol formation reaction (2) nCO+2nH2 →C n H2n +1OH+(n-1)H2O Fischer–Tropsch reaction (3) nCO+(2n +1)H2 →C n H2n +2 + nH2O. If, on the other hand, one assumes that direct hydrogenation of CO2 occurs, the following reaction equations will describe the chemistry: Alcohol formation reaction (4) nCO2 +3nH2 →C n H2n +1OH+(2n-1)H2O Fischer–Tropsch reaction (5) nCO2 +(3n +1)H2 →C n H2n +2 +2nH2O. For all the experimental conditions we screened, CO is the major carbon containing product. This proves that reaction (1) occurs and that there is a mixture of CO/CO2/H2 present in the reactor. The mechanism for the alcohol formation cannot be proven from this set of data. One option is that it is formed through CO and H2 as is the case when syngas is used as a feed. Another option would be that methanol is formed through a direct hydrogenation of CO2. For this type of catalyst, no experiments with isotopic labeling have been performed so the question on mechanism remains unanswered. In any case, there is more consensus on the hypothesis that for the chain growth of the alcohol into ethanol and higher alcohols, CO is needed and thus the r-WGS reaction needs to take place. Regardless of the mechanism, based on the equations above (either combining 1 and 2/3 or focusing only at 4/5) it is clear what the required (stoichiometric) ratio of H2/CO2 is. For the alcohol formation reactions this ratio will always be 3/1, regardless of the length of the alcohol carbon chain. This is the reason why a ratio of 3/1 was chosen in the experiments (and not 2/1, which is typically the optimal H2/CO ratio when using syngas as a feed). For the Fischer–Tropsch reactions, the required ratio depends on the length the alkane carbon chain: 4/1 for methane, 7/2 for ethane, 10/3 for propane, etc. At a H2/CO2 feed ratio of 1, the main product is CO. This CO is produced via the r-WGS reaction. The rates of the alcohols and alkane formation reactions are relatively low in this case. This is probably caused by the relatively low amount of hydrogen available in the system. Most of it will be used by the r-WGS reaction. This explains the relatively high CO selectivity and the relatively low alcohol and alkane selectivity. Also the conversion of CO2 stays low in this case. When feeding a 3/1 mixture of H2/CO2, which is the stoichiometric ratio for alcohol formation, the CO2 conversion is higher, the CO selectivity is lower, and the alcohols and alkane selectivity is higher compared to feeding a 1/1 mixture of H2/CO2. We do not suggest that there is a real hydrogen limitation when feeding a 1/1 ratio of H2/CO2, but the H2/CO ratio in the reactor just seems to be less optimal for alcohol production in this case. The increase in temperature only marginally affects the conversion levels of both CO2 and H2. For an H2/CO2 feed ratio of 1 the effect is not significant, for a feed ratio of 3 the conversion is slightly higher for the higher temperature. Also the CO selectivity is hardly affected by the temperature rise at a fixed H2/CO2 feed ratio. This probably indicates that the system has reached the thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, concentrations of CO2/H2/CO do not change much in this case. There is, however, a large effect of the temperature on the selectivities to alcohols and hydrocarbons. The alcohol selectivity is lower and the selectivity toward hydrocarbons is higher at 340°C compared to 310°C. This is evident when looking at the alcohol to alkane ratio: this number increases from around 1 at higher temperatures to above 5 at lower temperatures. In addition, the selectivity ratio of longer compared to shorter chain alcohols and hydrocarbons changes with temperature. At higher temperature the chain growth is favored."
7,Conclusion,"This paper describes experimental results obtained in a fixed bed reactor using a CoMoS catalyst [11]. For the current set of experiments, a feed consisting of only CO2 and H2 was used. We conclude that CO2 and H2 can be used as a feed for the CoMoS catalyst to produce CO, alcohols, and hydrocarbons. Overall, a H2/CO2 ratio of 3 (or higher) is favorable for reaching significant conversion levels of H2 and CO2. A relatively small temperature increase does not significantly affect the conversion, probably due to a thermodynamic equilibrium constraint. However, low temperature is better for a good alcohol/alkane ratio. Mainly short chain alcohols are formed under these conditions, with methanol as the main alcohol product. Although the concept was proven, a process where CO2 and H2 are converted into alcohols/olefins is economically viable only if the hydrogen can be obtained in a cost effective manner."
