0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas has been and remains of attracting much attention as its cleanness, renewable character, and the highest gravimetric energy density (122 kJ g−1) [1–3]. As compared to the conventional chemical and electrolytical routes to produce hydrogen [4,5], biological hydrogen production provides a promising way because of its environmentally harmless [6,7]. Dark fermentation has been extensively studied because of their high efficiency and their potential to use renewable sources of biomass for hydrogen production [8,9]. However, its bottleneck is lower hydrogen yield as high effluent short-chain organic acid which can continue to pollute the environment [10–12]. Photosynthetic hydrogen production is a theoretically perfect process with transforming solar energy into hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria (12 mol H2/mol glucose). Photosynthetic bacteria can utilize organic substrates derived from wastewater to produce hydrogen [13], such as sugar industry wastewater [14,15], olive mill wastewater [16] and dairy industry wastewater [17]. However, the actual hydrogen yields are much lower than the theoretical maximum value. Promoting the hydrogen production yield of photosynthetic bacteria is one of the challenging issues presently faced by researchers. Some researchers have studied the effects of several parameters, such as carbon source, nitrogen source, C/N ratio, temperature, light intensity and nutrient medium [18–23] on photosynthetic hydrogen production. However, high hydrogen yield for the production of hydrogen has not been obtained. The photosynthetic bacteria contain light-harvesting system, which converts light energy to chemical energy [24,25]. Light source is crucial because all energy required for hydrogen production and electron transport is derived from the light energy [26]. In addition, only part of spectrum can be utilized by photosynthetic bacteria. The energy conversion efficiency from light to hydrogen varies under different light sources [27]. pH is another important factor influencing photosynthetic hydrogen production. The proper pH plays an important role in the hydrogen-producing process due to its influences on bacterial activity [28,29] and metabolism pathways [30,31]. Among the photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides has been extensively studied. In previous work, we have evaluated the effects of carbon sources on photosynthetic hydrogen production [32]. In this study, the effects of light source, light intensity, inoculum and initial pH on biohydrogen production were investigated using R. sphaeroides RV. This work was aimed to optimize hydrogen-producing factors and improve hydrogen production yield. The results of this study are expected to provide favorable reference toward the application of photosynthetic hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Photosynthetic bacteria and growth medium,"2.1 Photosynthetic bacteria and growth medium Rb. sphaeroides RV was purchased from Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The strains were grown in basic medium, which was composed of a basal mineral medium (1 L of basal mineral medium was composed of K2HPO4, 600 mg; KH2PO4, 500 mg; NaCl, 400 mg; CaCl2⋯2H2O, 50 mg; MgCl2⋯6H2O, 200 mg; FeSO4⋯7H2O, 5 mg; ZnCl2, 7 mg; CuSO4⋯5H2O, 2.4 mg; H3BO3, 16 mg; MnSO4⋯4H2O, 10 mg; NiCl2⋯6H2O, 2 mg; CoCl2⋯6H2O, 2 mg; NaMoO4⋯2H2O, 4 mg; EDTA-2Na, 0.4 mg), vitamins (1.4 mg/L vitamin H, 0.5 mg/L vitamin B1, 3.0 mg/L nicotinamide), 0.3 g/L yeast extract, 1.25 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g/L glucose and 6.84 g/L sodium succinate. The strains were cultivated anaerobically for 24 h under photosynthetic condition of 4000 lux at 32 °C (light-grown cells) and used as inoculum. When required, an inoculum culture was concentrated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min."
3,Experimental method in photo-fermentation,"2.2 Experimental method in photo-fermentation Hydrogen-production batch experiments were performed in 320 or 40 mL glass column photobioreactor. Fig. S1 schematically describes the photobioreactor (Supplementary materials). The temperature was maintained at 32 °C. The basic mineral mediums, sodium glutamate (0.67 g/L) and sodium acetate (1.45 g/L) were used as the medium for photosynthetic hydrogen production. The basic mineral mediums were the same as Section 2.1. Initial pH was adjusted with 4% (w/v) sodium hydroxide or 4% (w/v) hydrochloric acid. Argon gas was used to create anaerobic conditions. The gas volume was calibrated to 25 °C and 760 mm Hg. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate. All chemicals used in the experiments were of AR grade."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis The hydrogen content was determined by a gas chromatograph (Techcomp. Co., China, 7890II) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2-m stainless steel column packed with Porapak Q (80–100 mesh). The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were set at 70, 50 and 70 °C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. At each time interval, the total volume of biogas production was measured by a plunger displacement method using appropriately sized glass syringes [33]. The cumulative hydrogen volume was calculated by the following equation [34]: V H , i = V H , i − 1 + C H , i ( V G , i − V G , i − 1 ) + V H , 0 ( C H , i − C H , i − 1 ) where V H,i and V H,i−1 are cumulative hydrogen volumes at the current (i) and previous (i−1) time intervals, V G,i and V G,i−1 are the total biogas volumes in the current (i) and previous (i−1) time intervals, C H,i and C H,i−1 are the fraction of hydrogen in the headspace of the bottle at the current (i) and previous (i−1) intervals and V H,0 is the total volume of headspace in the bottle. Detection of the alcohols and volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C2-C6) were measured by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU Co., Japan, GC 14B) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 2-m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30–60 mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were set at 200, 165 and 200 °C, respectively. The carrier gas was argon at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Light intensity was measured with TES-1332 luminometer (Shenzhen Langpu Electronic Tech. Co. Ltd). Cell mass concentration was determined spectrophotometrically as optical density at 660 nm (OD660)."
5,Model analysis,"2.4 Model analysis The cumulative hydrogen production in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation [35]: H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL), P is hydrogen production potential (mL), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), e is 2.71828, λ is the lag-phase time (h), and t is the incubation time (h). The corresponding values of P, R m and λ for each batch were estimated using Origin 7.5, which is a scientific graphing and data analysis software."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of light source and light intensity on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effects of light source and light intensity on hydrogen production Halogen, tungsten and fluorescent lamps were used for light sources. Light intensity was measured at the surface of the vessel with TES-1332. Fig. S2 shows UV–vis absorption spectra of Rb. sphaeroides RV (Supplementary Materials). It indicates the absorption peaks located in 596 nm, 802 nm and 856 nm. It was reported that there was a characteristic absorption peak at the wavelength from 830 to 890 nm from bacteriochlorophyll a and it turned out that bacteria contain bacteriochlorophyll a [36,37]. The absorption peak in the range of 1020–1040 spectra region could not be detected, indicating that bacteria contain no bacteriochlorophyll b [37]. Table S1 shows the effect of light source on hydrogen production for photosynthetic bacteria. The hydrogen production for halogen and tungsten lamps was better than it for fluorescent lamp, which is because halogen and tungsten lamps have a wide range of wavelengths relative to fluorescent lamp. The range of wavelengths could satisfy the short-wave absorption of bacterial carotenoid (450–550 nm) and the long-wave absorption of bacteriochlorophyll a (715–1050 nm). Thimijan et al. reported that only specific wavelength of spectrum could active photosynthetic hydrogen production [38]. Miyake et al. found that photosynthetic bacteria got different responses under different light sources due to selective absorption for the specific light wavelengths [27]. So halogen and tungsten lamps were the better light source. Fig. 1 shows the light intensity of tungsten lamp affected cumulative hydrogen production. Light intensities were adjusted to 1200, 2400, 3600, 4800 and 6000 lux. The lower cumulative hydrogen volume and longer lag-phase time occurred at 1200 and 2400 lux. The cumulative hydrogen gradually increased to 21.6 mL with light intensity increased to 6000 lux. In addition, the lag-phase times shorten and the growth rate of bacteria increased. Table 1 shows the effect of light intensity on hydrogen production. Bacteria could grow well in all light intensity and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were greater than 2.0 g/L. The acetate consumption efficiency, hydrogen production, VSS and hydrogen yield remained unchanged hardly when light intensity exceeds 3600 lux. So 3600 lux was the saturated light intensity. The maximum light conversion efficiency was 0.72% at 3600 lux. The light conversion efficiency dramatically decreased when exceeding 3600 lux. Previous researches reported that the light conversion efficiency to hydrogen decreased with increasing light intensity [26,39], and the high light intensities are harmful to hydrogen production [40–42]. The higher light intensities induced rapid proliferation of bacteria and the increase of bacteria concentration, resulting in the decrease of light transmission and hydrogen production. In summary, 3600 lux was the best light intensity using tungsten lamp as light source for photosynthetic hydrogen production."
8,Effect of inoculating quantity on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of inoculating quantity on hydrogen production In this section, inoculating quantity was characterized quantitatively by initial OD660. Fig. 2 illustrates the effects of initial OD660 on final OD660 and cumulative hydrogen production. The results showed that the cumulative hydrogen production increased with increasing initial OD660 from 0.212 to 0.931, however, it trended to decrease with further increasing OD660 to 1.082. The self-shading effect of the cultures increased with the increment of OD660, which resulted in the decrease of hydrogen production [25]. The maximum cumulative hydrogen production of 32.6 mL was obtained at initial OD660 of 0.931. This suggested that in an appropriate range, initial OD660 could increase the cumulative hydrogen production with increasing initial OD660. In addition, the OD660 pattern with time exhibited a typical lag, exponential and stationary phase. The maximum final OD660 occurred at initial OD660 of 0.931. The effect of different initial OD660 on the substrate degradation and hydrogen conversion rate are shown in Table 2 . The acetate consumption efficiency increased with increasing initial OD660. Sodium glutamate consumption efficiencies were all greater than 95%. The maximum hydrogen production volume and hydrogen conversion rate (2.43%) were obtained at initial OD660 of 0.931."
9,Effect of initial pH on hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of initial pH on hydrogen production pH is an important factor influencing hydrogen-producing activity of photosynthetic bacteria [43]. Fig. 3 shows the effect of initial pH on hydrogen production. Fig. 3a indicated that hydrogen volume and hydrogen content were affect significantly by initial pH. The maximum of hydrogen volume and hydrogen content were 5.19 mL and 44% at initial pH 7.0, respectively. The maximum terminal OD660 were 2.232 and 2.245 at initial pH 7.0 and 8.0, respectively. Hustede et al. reported that bacteria cultures that buffered to avoid alkalinization were beneficial with hydrogen production [44]. The difference between initial pH and terminal pH was directly proportional to hydrogen volume, suggested that higher hydrogen volume was accompanied by the increase of pH. Other study found the pH firstly increased and then slightly decreased in the hydrogen-producing process [45]. In Table 3 the modified Gompertz model fits experimental data well with the R 2 values, which are all greater than 0.99. The minimum lag-phase time (5.6 h), the maximum hydrogen production rate (0.39 mL/h) and hydrogen production potential (5.19 mL) were produced at initial pH 7.0. The maximum acetate consumption efficiency and hydrogen yield were 98.2% and 653.2 mmol H2/mol-acetate at initial pH 7.0, respectively. In summary, the favorable initial pH for hydrogen production from acetate by phototrophic bacteria was found at pH 7.0."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, the photosynthetic hydrogen production has been improved through single-factor experiment. The results suggested: 1. The best light intensity of hydrogen production was 3600 lux for tungsten lamp. 2. Inoculum quantity experiments indicated that the higher hydrogen production volume and hydrogen conversion rate were obtained at initial OD660 of 0.931. 3. Initial pH experiments indicated that the maximum hydrogen yield reached to 653.2 mmol H2/mol acetate at initial pH 7.0. Next, response surface methodology will be used to find the optimum condition for maximizing photosynthetic hydrogen yield."
