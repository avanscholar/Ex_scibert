0,Introduction,"Noble metal catalysts including Au, Pd, Rh, Pt have been widely used in the fields of environmental protection, energy conversion, food processing, petrochemical and fine chemical industry due to their high catalytic activity, perfect selectivity, high temperature resistance, strong corrosion resistance and other comprehensive properties [1–4]. However, since their valuableness and scarcity, there is a critical need to develop new effective catalyst systems with lower cost in green catalysis science. For heterogeneous metal catalysts, the interfacial electronic structure is an important factor which could affect and control the catalytic performance of the catalysts [5–8]. Both the adsorption behavior of reactants and the process of reaction on the catalyst can be influenced by controlling the electronic structure of the catalyst, enhancing the catalytic activities finally [9–12]. Besides constructing the multimetallic and using supports with strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), the modification of organic ligands on metal-based heterogeneous catalysts and the regulation of crystal surface are also helpful to induce the change of the electronic structure and enhance the catalytic activity [13–16]. Zhang et al. have reported that supported metal catalysts modified by organic ligands exhibited an unexpectedly high selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO [17]. Liu et al. also used the schiff base to improve the hydrogen production efficiency of gold catalysts in the pure formic acid system [18]. Tuning the electronic structure by ligands hasbecome an effective and low-cost approach to optimize the catalytic performance of precious metalcatalysts. Although the supported gold catalyst with molecular oxygen has been developed as one of the ideal catalyst systems with high selectivity and environmentalbenefit, the activity and catalytic efficiency of gold catalyst are still limited [19,20], which blocks it from the theoretical designtopractical application. Some researches have shown that gold with (211) step contributed to the dissociation of oxygen, which has a promotion on the oxidation reaction [21,22]. Our previous report also confirmed that Au(211) surface obtains a higher conversion of alcohol due to the strengthened adsorption of alcohol and oxygen molecules [23,24]. However, the specific interaction mechanism between reactants and active sites remains to be determined at an atomic level [25,26]. Moreover, since the essence between different molecules can be attributed to the interaction of different electric charges, it is meaningful to understanding the electronic effect on this reaction as well as building accurately models which can rapidly predict reaction activity as a function of the electronic structure. It can be conductive to design and develop alternative catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols in chemical production [27–30]. Herein we develop an efficient method which can be used to predict the electronic effect on gold catalysts. AuNPs post-treated by N-heterocyclicmolecules have a significantly improved activity in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The optimal ligand-modified gold catalyst shows an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) (6197 h−1, 220 °C), which is more than twice that of other supported gold catalysts and is similar to the (211)-dominant twinning gold reported by us before, conducting us to understand the significance of electronic effect in the gas-phase aerobic oxidation of alcohols. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with a series of in-situ techniques indicate that both ligand-modified gold and (211) twinning gold have lower work functions as well as high degree of disorder, which acts a key factor for the enhanced activation and dissociation of oxygen molecules, promoting the catalytic activity on the oxidation process. These simple surface mechanism studies may therefore be applied to optimize the activity of industrial catalysts in the atmospheric condition as a guideline, highlightinga broad application prospectin the future."
1,Methodology,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of SiO2 The synthesis of SiO2 is according to the Stöber method with some modifications [31]. In a typical synthesis of silica microspheres, 160 mL of ethanol (containing 10 mL of water) mingled 6.28 mL of ammonia water (25%) mixed with 160 mL of ethanol (containing 10 mL of water) were added into a beaker withthethermostaticwater-set. After 30 min vigorously stirring at room temperature, tetraethyl orthosilicate (12 mL) was added into this solution. After continuous stirring for another 2 h, the mixture was centrifuged and dried at 60 °C overnight and then calcined at 350 °C in air for 5 h. 2.1.2 Synthesis of 1 wt% Au/SiO2 AuNPs (1 wt% Au/SiO2) were loaded on the silica microspheres by a deposition–precipitationmean with NH3 solution as previously reported with some modifications [32]. 1 g of SiO2 microspheres were introduced into 10 mL HAuCl4·4H2O solution (5.1 × 10-3 M) and the suspension was stirred vigorously at 75 °C for 60 min. Then, the solution was cooled down to 25 °C and ammonia water (1 M) was added until the pH valueexceeds10.After the solution continued stirring for 1 h, the solid was collected by centrifuging, washed 3 times in the 10 mL water solution, and then dried all night along in a vacuum drying oven at 50 °C. The precursor was reduced in the 5% H2/Ar atmosphere at 300 °C before being used for the catalytic reaction. The actual loading amount of gold was checked by the ICP-MS. 2.1.3 Process of ligand treatment For the post-treatment of AuNPs by the ligands, 500 mg of prepared 1 wt% Au/SiO2 samples were soaked in 10 mL of ethanol with 0.05 mmol of ligands (e.g. bipyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, thiophene and dodecanethiol) for 2 h at room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 rmp for 5 min, followed by drying and annealing in air at a temperature 0–5 °C higher than the corresponding boiling point for 1 h. The same method was used for the post-treatment of commercial AuNPs. 2.1.4 Synthesis of (211)-dominant twinning AuNPs The synthetic method is similar to our previous report [22]. The size is 3.3 nm which determined by TEM. 2.1.5 Synthesis of 5.2 nm AuNPs The synthetic method is similar to the synthesis of 3.3 nm AuNPs, except that the reducing agent is replaced from 83.6 mg NaBH4 to 220 mg tert-Butylamine borane (BTBC). 2.1.6 Synthesis of 8.3 nm AuNPs As the typical synthesis, HAuCl4 (30 mg) was added into Oleamine solution (10 mL) to form a clear solution. The mixture was heated until the colour of the solution became colourless. 100 mg BTBC was added into the solution which was cooled down to 90 °C. Keeping the mixture in 5 min until it became black. Raising the temperature to 140 °C gradually for 1–2 h before it cooled down. The products were separated as black solid powder by centrifugation. 2.1.7 Synthesis of 11.2 nm AuNPs The synthetic method is similar to the synthesis of 8.3 nm AuNPs, except that raising the temperature to 140 °C rapidly after the adding of 100 mg of BTBC. 2.1.8 Synthesis of 1% Au/SiO2 with different sizes AuNPs were loaded on SiO2 as previously reported by a colloid deposition method."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Transmission electron microscopy(TEM) images of the AuNPs and ligand-modified samples were recorded on the transmission electron microscope with model Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out on a Bruker D8 diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA, 5° min−1 from 30° to 50°). Rietveld refinement of XRD data was performed in GSAS-II using the chebyschev-1 algorithm with 3 terms to fit a background polynomial. Instrument parameters were refined according to the gold diffraction intensity standard and only the 1) pattern intensity, 2) unit cell a parameter, 3) particle size, and 4) particle strain were refined in successive order. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were tested on a spectrometer (VG Scientific ESCALAB Mark II). All binding energies in our report were corrected according to the standard C1s peak at 284.6 eV. The analysis of ICP-MS was performed on a spectrometer to determine the actual loading of the prepared catalysts. DRIFT-IR spectroscopy was measured by the spectrometer (Bruker Vertex80v FTIR) which has a resolution of 4 cm−1 and a scanned number of 32 times, equipping with a low-temperaturecell. In-situ Raman spectroscopy was recorded by a LabRAM HR 800 system combined with a He-Ne laser (light power = 17 mW, wavelength = 633 nm). The resolution of the Raman system was around 1 cm−1, and the number of scans was set to 30. XAFS measurements were performed at the 9BM beamline of the Advanced Photon Source located in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Au L3-edge XAFS data was processed with Demeter (v.0.9.26) as previous report."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation 2.3.1 Catalytic experiments The catalytic measurement for selective oxidation of alcohols in gas-phase was performed in a fixed bed reactor as described in our previous report[22]. The oxygen stream and the liquid reactant were delivered into the reactor through a syringe pump. The tests were carried out between 210 °C and 260 °C. The products were collected and checked by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. The gas-phase products were analyzed by the thermal conductivity detector. 2.3.2 Gas-phase titration experiment of oxygen The gas phase titration experiment of oxygen was performed at 220 °C in the fixed bed reactor and 2000 mg catalyst was pretreated by the pure O2 for an hour. Subsequently, N2 (30 mL.min−1) was used as the carrier gas to remove the oxygen physisorption on the gold surface and 1 μl benzyl alcohol was slowly injected to detect the chemisorbed amount of oxygen species according to the amount of benzaldehyde. The unreacted benzyl alcohol and liquid products were collected by cold trap filled with ethanol solution and quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography. 2.3.3 Gas-phase titration experiment of benzyl alcohol (BA) The gas phase titration experiment of BA was carried out at 220 °C with the fixed bed reactor and 2000 mg catalysts were pretreated by the pure N2 at 40 mL.min−1 for an hour. Then 1 μl benzyl alcohol was slowly injected to perform the absorption on the surface of the catalysts. The carrier gas was replaced by O2 after N2 purged for an hour continually. The chemisorption of the BA species on the catalyst could be identified according to the amount of benzaldehyde. The unreacted benzyl alcohol and liquid products were collected by cold trap filled with ethanol solution and quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Binding ligands with a post-treatment method,"3.1 Binding ligands with a post-treatment method Au/SiO2 catalysts were first prepared by the DPmethod as previously reported with some modifications, while ligand functionalization of gold catalysts was carried out by a post-treatment method which could not induce the obvious sintering of the gold catalyst. As a typical bipyridine treatment, fresh Au/SiO2 catalyst was treated by the ethanol containing a certain amount of bipyridine at room temperature, following by a 1 h calcination at the corresponding boiling point (Table S1). All the notations of the ligands are listed in the Table S1. The coverage of ligands on the surface of AuNPs can be easily achieved by regulating the concentration of ligands/ethanol solution. The quantitative analysis of surface coverage of ligands and electrochemical active surface area are obtained by the single-layer underpotential deposition of lead salt on the gold surface (Fig. S1). For instance, after processed by the 10 mL bipyridine /ethanol solution (5 mol/L), the actual surface coverage of 500 mg Au/SiO2 catalysts was 58%. TEM and XRD results indicated there is no visible particle aggregation occurred during the ligand modification processes (6.5 ± 1.6 nm versus 6.7 ± 1.2 nm, Fig. 1 a,1b and Fig. S2). High-resolution TEM images (HRTEM) showed that the facets and the morphology of the gold did not change after the 2,2-bipyridine treatment (Fig. 1c and 1d). The spacing of the lattice fringe is 0.235 nm, which is corresponded to Au(111) space. Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns further confirmed these results (Table S2). Besides, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern with clear diffraction lattice indicated both the AuNPs before and after ligand treatment were single-crystal In contrast, the surficial electronic structures of AuNPs are indeed changed by the presence of ligands. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the binding energies of Au/SiO2 catalyst located at 83.7 eV and 87.6 eV can be readily attributed to Au4f7/2 and Au4f5/2 signals of Au0. However, once Au/SiO2 is modified by the N-heterocyclic molecules (e.g. bipyridine, pyridine), the Au4f signals downshift about 0.5 eV. These results clearly indicate that gold is an electron acceptor in this system. Au L3-edge XANES spectra were collected to further follow the valence state of the gold. As it turned out, no obvious white normalized line intensity ascribed to the sign of Au3+ was observed in all the samples, indicating Au3+ were totally reduced in the preparation process (Fig. 2b). According to previous reports [33], the peak located at 11.945 keV was corresponded to the bulk gold (Au0), which was disappeared after ligands binding on the gold, implying an enriched electron density on gold catalysts at micro-level."
7,Gas-phase aerobic oxidation of alcohols,"3.2 Gas-phase aerobic oxidation of alcohols Gas-phase aerobic oxidation of alcohols is an ideal model reaction to investigate the surficial interaction because it is one of the most fundamental reactions which have been widely used in industrial synthetic chemistry [34,35]. Fig. 3 a shows the turnover frequency (TOF) values of different Au/SiO2 catalysts. Here, TOF is defined as the number of BA reacted per hour per gold atom on the surface. The Au dispersion (D) is determined by D = 1.3/dAu (nm), where dAu is calculated according to the Scherrer equation [19]. All the notations of the ligands showed in Fig. 3a are defined in Table S1. Interestingly, all these catalysts exhibit very different activities. Au/SiO2 catalysts modified by N-heterocyclicmolecules exhibit superior activity over Au/SiO2, corresponding to their electron-rich Au surfaces measured by semi-in situ methods (Fig. 3b). The optimal TOF on Au/SiO2-bipy (6100 h−1) is about three times higher than that on Au/SiO2 (2230 h−1), clearly indicating the importance of ligands. As we have seen yet, this is the highest space–time yield ever reported for (111)-dominant Au catalysts in aerobic oxidation of BA (Table S4), closing to twinning Au(211) catalyst which have been reported by us before. The formation of Au-S bond on the Au(111) surface might block the active sites and poison the catalysts. As a result, Au/SiO2-th and Au/SiO2-tp exhibit inferior activity to Au/SiO2. To further investigate the electronic effect as well as excluding other factors, catalytic activities of gold nanoparticles with different sizes were examined by us in the 220 °C (Table S5). Synthetic methods of different sizes of AuNPs and twinning-dominated AuNPs were referred to the section of supporting information. It could be seen that TOF values did not have significant changes with different sizes. Taking the logarithm of the reaction rate and the logarithm of the radius as the ordinate and abscissa respectively, an approximate straight line can be obtained with the slope of the straight line near −1.1 (Fig. S7), indicating that all the surficial gold atoms participate in the process of oxidation [36]. These results exclude the influence of size effect and interface effect (slope value between −1.7 and −2.5). Drawing support from ligands with poor stability, we successfully established a direct correlation between surface electronic structures and their catalytic activities by a combination of long-term catalytic tests and XPS measurements (Fig. S3a and S3b). As can be seen from Fig. S3b, a pronounced shift (~0.5 eV) toward lower binding energy is observed on the Au/SiO2-py (83.4 eV) relative to the Au/SiO2 (83.7 eV). Correspondingly, the TOF of Au/SiO2-py (5659 h−1) is 2.54 times higher than that of Au/SiO2 (2230 h−1). A continuous operation leads to a fast decay in TOF due to desorption of pyridine at 220 °C until it returns to Au/SiO2 identically 30 h later. Interestingly, by charging a small amount (0.2 wt%) of pyridine in benzyl alcohol, the deactivated TOF could recover and the downshift of Au4f signal reappears. These findings open another way to demonstrate that the electron-rich gold surface induced by ligands is the key factor for the promotion of catalytic activity. Nevertheless, ligands with high coverage may have a negative effect on the catalyst due to the steric effect (Fig. 3c). With the help of electrochemical means, the coverage can be determined by the ratio of the integral area for CO stripping curves between the ligand-covered catalysts and blank catalysts. At first, the conversion rate of Au /SiO2-bipy catalyst increased with the growth of bipyridine coverage, until it reached up to 58.2%, accompanied by the conversion reached the maximum (11%), and then began to decline. Further tests were performed by us to validate the coverage influence for other ligands (Table S6). The end results indicate that there is indeed a dynamic balance between the electronic effect and the steric effect of ligands. Only when the electron effect is dominant at low coverage could promote the oxidation process."
8,Kinetic studies on different electronic-rich catalysts,"3.3 Kinetic studies on different electronic-rich catalysts Kinetic studies were conducted to illuminate the mechanics preliminarily. Arrhenius plots of different Au/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 a and similar apparent activation energies (73.8 vs 67.3 vs 66.4 kJ mol−1) imply similar temperature sensitivity for these catalysts. Partial pressure experiments (Fig. 4b and 4c) demonstrate that both the apparent reaction orders of BA and O2 molecules are obviously reduced due to the existence of bipyridine, suggesting that the adsorption of bipyridine on Au surface could significantly strengthen the adsorption of BA and O2. Together with XPS and activation energy data, it leads us to an inference that the electron rich gold surface provides more active sites for the adsorption of reactants. In addition, Au/SiO2-pdz also shows smaller apparent reaction orders of BA (0.477 vs. 0.725) and O2 (0.461 vs. 0.756) than Au/SiO2, which is in good agreement with the inference. Subsequently, the chemisorption of BA and O2 was quantitatively analyzed by alcohol-oxygen titration experiments [37]. Typically, catalysts pre-exposed to oxygen was flushed by N2 (30 mL.min−1) to remove physically adsorbed O2 molecules. BA was introduced to react with the chemisorbed oxygen. Interestingly, the selectivity towards benzaldehyde is more than 98%, distinctly confirming that the chemisorption sites are responsible for BA selective oxidation. The concentration of chemisorbed O2 molecules on the AuNPs was then determined by the amount of produced benzaldehyde (2:1). Similarly, the chemisorbed BA could be titrated by O2 molecules. As shown in Fig. S4, the chemisorption of O2 on Au/SiO2 is very weak. However, once the Au/SiO2 catalyst is modified by electron-donating ligands (bipyridine and pyridazine), the amount of chemisorbed oxygen increase significantly. The adsorption capacity of O2 on Au/SiO2 is very weak. The adsorption capacity of O2 on Au/SiO2-bipy (1.08 mg.gAu -1) and Au/SiO2-pdz (0.85 mg.gAu -1) is 5.7-fold and 4.5-fold higher than Au/SiO2 (0.19 mg.gAu -1), consistent in the smaller reaction order of O2 shown in Fig. 4c. Besides, as shown in Fig. S4b, the presence of N-ligands also improves the chemisorption of BA on Au/SiO2 catalyst, coinciding with the kinetic study shown in Fig. 4b.Based on these researches, the chemisorption properties of gold catalysts were simulated by DFT calculations. Optimizing adsorption parameters and configurations are summarized in Table S3 and Fig. 4d. Clearly, adsorption energies of BA and O2 on N-ligands modified Au(111) surface are higher than those on clean Au(111) surface. Distances between Au(111) surface and reactant molecules are shorter with the existence of ligands, confirming that the presence of N-ligands on AuNPs facilitates the chemisorption of BA and O2. Bader charge analysis was conducted to verify the electronic effect of ligands on the Au(111) surface. Interestingly, all the values of Bader charges on N-ligand modified AuNPs are positive, indicating that electron transfers from N-ligand to the gold surface. Among various N-ligands, pyridine exhibits the largest bader charge population (0.075), in line with the previous XPS analysis."
9,In-situ characterization of electronic-rich catalysts,"3.4 In-situ characterization of electronic-rich catalysts Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was examined to distinguish the influence of the fracture of C-H and O-H bonds in the process of oxidation (Table S7). It is remarkable that the KIE values of different types of AuNPs are far less than 2, implying that the breaking of C-H and O-H is not the rate-limiting step [38]. However, these results are quite different in the liquid BA oxidation with the KIE value up to 3.8 at 120 °C, in good agreement with a previous report from Hutchings’ Group indicating there may be two different mechanisms between gas-phase and liquid-phase reactions [39]. Interestingly, both the twinning structure and ligands greatly increased the KIE value of the C-H bond, implying a similar action between the twinning effect and ligand effect. According to the previous report on the single crystal gold model catalyst from Friends’ Group, the existence of active oxygen species (O and OH, etc.) can greatly promote the efficiency of BA oxidation [40]. In light of this, it can be inferred that electronic effect in our reaction could influence the formation of oxygen species. Thus, a series of in-situ characteration was employed to examine behaviors in the real reaction environment. In-situ EPR spin trapping experiments with DMPO as the scavenger were examined for superoxide anion species (Fig S8). However, there were no apparent EPR signals observed on the gold catalysts processed by different ligands as well as the twinning-dominant gold in the BA oxidation, indicating their poor capabilities to produce the superoxide anion species, excluding the promoting effect from the superoxide anion species which could be induced by the electron-rich gold. Then, chemical structure and coordination environment of different gold catalysts were investigated by the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS). It was evident that gold catalysts had structural discrepancy after the enrichment for electrons (Fig. 5 a and Table S8). According to the radial distribution function of Au L3-edge, both binding ligands and twinning structure could slightly promote Au-Au peaks shift to high values, indicating the Au-Au bond length increases induced by the electronic effect. Moreover, the intensity of peaks became weaken compared to the Au foil, which implied the relaxation of metal binding and the high disorder for the surficial gold atoms. All these changes in the microstructure deeply influence the dissociation of O2 molecules on the gold. In-situ Raman spectra was performed to investigate the active atomic oxygen species produced during the reaction. Considering that active oxygen species are too active to detect on the surface of small gold nanoparticles (<50 nm), commercialized gold nanoparticles at about 500 nm were used to carry out in-situ experiments at room temperature. Furthermore, ligand modified gold catalysts were used as the research objects to investigate the electronic effect for BA oxidation due to their uncomplicated and easy operations. According to the preceding report, there is no significant size effect on the gold catalysts in the BA oxidation, providing the possibility for us to control the influence of other variables to study the electronic effect on the surface of gold. In addition, a mixture of BA with 0.2 wt% ligands was used as the substrate and identical catalytic performances could be obtained by this mixture as the former Au/SiO2-py catalyst (Fig. S9). On the other side, this mixing method could greatly maintain the stability and continuity of electronic effect during the reaction, which was more practical and meaningful. BA and ligands were introduced into the system by a bubble method. As the commercialized AuNPs, it could be seen that the mixing of ligands also significantly enhanced their catalytic activity (2132 h−1 vs 4597 h−1) according to the on-line detection, indicating the electronic effect has indeed no size effect on the commercialized AuNPs (Fig. S10). As shown in Fig. 5b, a very small peak at 587 cm−1 is observed on AuNPs after 30 min of reaction. According to Liu’s report, such a peak could be assigned to atomic oxygen species (Au-O-Au) generated on the gold while the broad peak at 800 cm−1 is ascribed to the phenyl C-H in BA [41]. The broad peak which could be identified as the OOH species (822 cm−1) was not detected, implying that no OOH species were produced in the reaction process. Control experiments conducted in pure oxygen without BA show no visible signals at 587 cm−1 (Fig. S11), consistent with the low dissociation probability of oxygen on Au surface. Moreover, stronger atomic oxygen signals are observed when N-ligands are bubbled together with BA [42]. The ratio of integrated Au-O-Au intensity to integrated C-H intensity increases from 0.13 for BA to 0.34 for BA mixed with 0.2 wt% pyridine, clearly indicating that ligands exhibited significant promoting effects on oxygen dissociation compared to the increment of BA adsorption on the gold. It is important to emphasize that active oxygen signals have a persistence in the entire reaction process, indicating that Au surface could dissociate O2 in a catalytic manner. Despite unattainability for twinning-dominant AuNPs in large sizes, DFT calculations introduced by the NVT canonical ensemble were performed by us to simulate the concentration of the coverage of partial intermediate species for the BA oxidation at 473 K (Table S9). It can be concluded from the result that the concentration of active oxygen species has an obvious increase on Au(211) compared to Au(111) surface (7.67e-10 vs 1.12e-10), which validates the Au(211) structure also promote the dissociation of O2. Taking all together, we can thus correlate the catalytic performance to the surface electronic structure of AuNPs. Specifically, the electron-rich structural AuNPs reduce the interaction energy of Au-Au bond which causes the structural disorder for the gold, and provide more sites for activation of reactants, especially molecular oxygen, and consequently exhibit superior activities in the oxidation of alcohols."
10,Work functions as the link of ligand and twinning effect,"3.5 Work functions as the link of ligand and twinning effect The work function refers to the minimum energy for an electron to escape from the metal surface, which is closely related to the Fermi level of the system [43–46]. Work functions of different types of gold were calculated as a comparison to explore the correlation between twinning structure and ligands (Fig. 6 a). Results indicated that ligands as well as twinning step surface have an induction to lower work functions than Au (111) surface, meaning the ability for electrons to escape from the gold surface had been enhanced [47]. Both twinning structure and Au-ligands system can be regarded as special electronic-rich structure, contributing to the oxidation of alcohols (Fig. S12). Based on this, an electron was injected into the Au(111) surface (recorded as Au(111)-) to simulate the extreme electronic effect (Fig. 6b). In the Au(111)-system, BA and O2 were co-adsorbed with the lowest energy. Interestingly, the injected electrons migrated and interacted with the oxygen molecule along with the system reached a new stable state, suggesting that the electronic effect for this Au(111)- system mainly affected the activation of O2 in the real reaction environment. Consequently, Theoretical calculations were used to investigate potential relationships between the activation of O2 and gold catalysts. Different types of gold catalysts were considered as a weak electron donor and work functions ϕ was used as a simple measure to reflect the electron-donating ability. Fig. 6a indicates that activation barrier and reaction energy for the dissociation of O2 are linear to ϕ values, implying that the electron-donation ability of the gold has a relatively main influence on the O2 activation both in kinetics (Ea) and thermodynamics (ΔE). Moreover, Au(111) combining with the bipyridine has the lowest values of work function as well as the easiest dissociation energy for O2 molecule, corresponding to the best catalytic activity in the ligand- modified gold catalysts in the BA oxidation (Fig. 3a). It is noteworthy that Au(111) surface pre-adsorbed a BA molecule can also induce the decrease of the work function value (5.07 vs 4.96), meaning that BA plays a role of weak electron-donor in this condition, which is conducive to O2 activation (Table S10). Fig. 6c further compares the free energy profiles of benzaldehyde formation on Au(111) and Au(111)-py. Overall, Au(111)-py is energetically favored for benzaldehyde formation over Au(111). In both cases, oxygen dissociation possesses the highest energy barrier and thus acts as the rate-determining step [48,49]. Importantly, pyridine molecules bound on the surface could significantly lower energy barriers for O2 dissociation (0.67 eV versus 1.24 eV), which is in accordance with our previous report (Figs. S13 and S14). It is noteworthy that the presence of pyridine on the Au(111) surface could also diminish the energy barrier for C-H cleavage (0.52 eV versus 0.65 eV). This situation also can be concluded from the DOS charts for different catalysts, in which the peaks of –CH2- move to the lower energy state (Fig. S15), indicating an easier activated state in the actual reaction. Subsequently, a further calculation was performed to explore the reaction path of the second BA molecule. It was interesting that the activation energy of the recombination of two OH radicals was lower than the abstracting of C-H bond both in Au(111) and Au(111)-py system (Fig. S16). This result implied that OH radicals produced from the first BA molecule are easier to recombine to form one H2O molecule and an O atom. Finally, O atoms participated in the reaction of the formation of the second benzaldehyde which was similar to the former process in Fig. 5c. Combining with a series of above results, it can be concluded that the improved oxygen dissociation and C-H cleavage are responsible for the high activity of electron-rich catalyst. Based on the above discussion, it can be inferred that facilitating oxygen activation induced by the electronic regulation could also promote the oxidation of other primary alcohols. To verify our hypothesis, the aerobic oxidation of a series of alcohols was conducted by us on various gold catalysts. As shown in Table S11, the catalytic activities of Au/SiO2-bipy, Au/SiO2-pz, Au/SiO2-pdz and Au/SiO2-(211) always higher than those of Au/SiO2 regardless of types of alcohols, indicating that electronic effect for gold catalysts in the gas-phase oxidation are universality. Even if 1-heptanol has the least effect in this method, electron-rich gold can also induce a 1.62 times enhancement. No obvious deactivation was detected for Au/SiO2-bipy catalysts during the catalytic test for benzyl alcohol in nearly 50 h (Fig. S17). Besides, XPS analysis carried out on the recycled catalyst, demonstrated that the spent Au/SiO2-bipy catalyst also exhibits a pronounced downshift of Au4f signals as compared to Au/SiO2, clearly revealing the good stability of Au/SiO2-bipy catalyst (Fig. S18). The same series of tests for the Au(211)-dominant twinning catalysts has been performed in our previous report. These results indicate that electronic regulation has a good stability and provides a good means to develop high efficiency gold catalyst for other gas-phase oxidation reactions."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, we developed an efficient method to analyze the electronic structure of gold catalysts on the research of gas-phase oxidation of alcohols. Binding N-ligands to the Au(111) produces electron-rich Au surfaces, which provide more active sites for the adsorption of reactants as well as the activation of the O2 molecule similar to twinning surfaces. A series of in-situ studies combining DFT calculations confirm that the electron-rich gold structure with lower work functions facilitates the oxygen dissociation, which consequently leads to an excellent activity in gas-phase oxidation of alcohols. All the results are beneficial for us to understand the reaction mechanism and to create more potential for the green oxidation of gold catalysts."
