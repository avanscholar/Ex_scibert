0,Introduction,"Currently, petroleum-based plastic materials have a serious environmental impact owing to their inert behavior in response to direct microbial attack. Therefore, to ensure the sustainability of products and environmental safety, alternatives to plastics such as modified plastics/natural-based products that can effectively improve the biodegradation efficiency and reduce environmental impact are attracting the interest of numerous researchers [1]. Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) have been widely employed in fields of mechanics, electronics, and biology owing to their excellent physical, mechanical, and biological properties [2]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is non-toxic, biocompatible, and degradable polymer, and is widely used in various fields [3]. Xiang et al. used supercritical CO2 (Sc-CO2) to prepare microcellular polymer foams and introduced four different types of amines into PVA to improve the foaming behavior [4]. Furthermore, Tian et al. prepared cross-linked PVA nanofibers by electrospinning and used glutaraldehyde vapor cross-linking to improve the water resistance and mechanical properties of the PVA film [5]. According to previous studies, the introduction of nanoparticles (NPs) into PVA films can enhance the tensile strength and crystal structure of the composite film [6,7]. TiO2 has considerable prospects for development as a photocatalytic antibacterial agent, and has attracted considerable attention owing to its affordability, nontoxicity, and unique physical and chemical properties [8]. The processing of nanomaterials incorporated into the polymer matrix improves the performance of the polymer matrix, which is closely related to the interaction and dispersion of the nanomaterials inside the matrix [9]. A commonly adopted method is direct addition of TiO2 particles to the substrate solution for film production; the film is obtained by continuous stirring, which is then poured into a glass container and dried [10]. However, owing to the high surface energy and large specific surface area, small particles of TiO2 powder easily form large aggregates, which are difficult to disperse in the liquid medium; further, complete utilization of the TiO2 characteristics cannot be achieved in the aggregate state [11]. Therefore, it is necessary to treat TiO2 before use. The synthesis of TiO2 particles in situ and incorporation into the polymer matrix is another common method; however, currently, this technique is only studied by extrusion and requires expensive equipment [12]. In this study, low-cost, effective, and pollution-free ultrasonic technology was used to address this problem. The high-frequency vibration and cavitation effect of ultrasonic waves were used to destroy the agglomeration structure of TiO2, such that it was evenly dispersed in the substrate solution, and its dispersion stability and photocatalytic activity were improved [13]. To enhance the antibacterial properties of the composite material when illuminated by visible light, organic photocatalytic materials were used for grafting. These materials are expected to compensate for the deficiency of TiO2 and can play a synergistic role in the antibacterial activity. 3,3′, 4,4 -Benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid (BPTA) is an organic compound with adequate light-induced antibacterial activity. Previous studies have shown that cotton cellulose treated with BPTA has superior antibacterial properties [14]. PVA on the polymer chain has numerous hydroxyl groups, which can form intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds [15]. The two anhydride groups of BPTA were hydrolyzed in hot water to obtain the corresponding tetracarboxylic acid (BPTCA). An aqueous solution of BPTCA can be directly used in the treatment of films, and the ester can be formed with the hydroxyl group of PVA under the catalysis of sodium hypophosphite [16,17]. After grafting with BPTA, the antibacterial mechanism of the composite material attains the triplet benzophenone double radical structure that can be readily oxygen-quenched; in addition, it can use a variety of biological agents and chemicals as active hydrogen sources to attract hydrogen atoms to form ketone groups [18]. Some peroxides and even superoxide agents may be generated when free radicals react with oxygen, and the products are called reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as HO• and H2O2, which lead to antimicrobial effects and chemical decomposition [19,20]. BPTA not only produces ROS under ultraviolet (UV) light, but also plays a role in visible light or light/dark conditions, compensating for the deficiency of TiO2 only under UV light, such that the composite material is “always working” as a bactericide [17,20]. Regarding the bactericidal principle of TiO2 and BPTA producing ROS, researchers believe that the generated ROS initially react with the bacterial cell wall, which is a crucial physical aspect of maintaining the integrity of the cell. Cell wall damage leads to an increase in cell permeability and allows ROS to further penetrate and attack the cell plasma membrane [21]. The peroxidation of membrane lipids and fatal destruction of cell membranes impair vital physiological functions such as respiration, and rapidly destroy the DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids, thereby reducing the cell viability and ultimately leading to the death of the bacterial cell [17]. Nano-TiO2 enhanced the mechanical properties and antibacterial activity of TiO2 and BPTA. In this study, we developed a new type of composite film that had significant antibacterial effects in both light and dark conditions. PVA/TiO2 NP films were prepared using the solvent casting method. Subsequently, a PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA film was obtained after the grafting reaction with BPTA under the catalysis of sodium hypophosphite [17]. Through the quantitative study of the ROS content produced by the composite film under light and dark conditions, and after the ROS produced by the film were quenched and reused, the “storage and sterilization ability” was explored, and antibacterial experiments were carried out. This film could be used as active packaging or as an antimicrobial material in the biomedical field."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA 1799 (degree of alcoholysis 98%–99%(mol/mol)), 3,3′,4,4′- BPTA purchased from Shanghai Yiyan Biological Technology Co., Ltd., and nano-sized TiO2 (20 nm in diameter, 99% pure, Hangzhou Wanjing New Material Co., Ltd.) were used as the starting materials. Acetone and sodium hypophosphite monohydrate were acquired from Chengdu Kelong Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Chengdu, China). N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline (p-NDA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus PTCC 1112) and Escherichia coli (E. coli PTCC1270) were acquired in lyophilized form from the China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (CICC, Beijing, China)."
3,Preparation of the nanocomposite PVA/TiO2 NPs films,"2.2 Preparation of the nanocomposite PVA/TiO2 NPs films Films were fabricated using the solvent casting method, in which the proportion of TiO2 NPs in the PVA solution was x wt%, where 0 < x < 10 [10]. Briefly, a 120 W ultrasonic bath (Shenzhen Union Ultrasonic Cleaning Co., Ltd., JP-020) was used to disperse TiO2 NPs in deionized water (10 mL) for 60 min. PVA (10 wt%) was stirred and dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water in a water bath at 80–90 °C, and TiO2 NPs were added to the obtained solution after full dissolution (approximately 3 h). The obtained mixed solution with NPs was vigorously stirred using a water bath magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous precursor solution, which was then subjected to ultrasonic treatment. Subsequently, the resulting viscous solution was poured onto a plexiglass plate and dried at 50 °C for 6 h, after which the completely dried films were peeled off; consequently, uniform, smooth, and thin films were obtained."
4,Catalytically grafted BPTA,"2.3 Catalytically grafted BPTA Because the use of benzophenone could compensate for the deficiency of TiO2, it could have synergistic effects on the photocatalytic activity. PVA/TiO2 NP films were grafted with BPTA to obtain PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA composite films [22]. BPTA was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 10 g L−1 by stirring at 80 °C, and sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (catalyst) was added to the solution, such that the ratio of catalyst to BPTA was 1:2 (mol/mol) [23]. The two anhydride groups of BPTA were hydrolyzed in hot water to obtain the corresponding tetracarboxylic acid, which could form an ester with the hydroxyl group of PVA under the catalysis of sodium hypophosphite [16]. After 2 h of reaction, the resulting films were washed with acetone and dried in a vacuum."
5,Film characterization,"2.4 Film characterization High-resolution scanning electron microcopy (SEM) equipment (FEI Quanta200, the Netherlands) was used to examine the surface morphology and evaluate the adhesion and distribution of TiO2 NPs in the PVA matrix operating at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin (FEI Co.) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The FTIR spectra of the film samples and pure materials were recorded on an FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Gmbh, Ettlingen, Germany) using an attenuated total reflectance accessory with a wavenumber range of 500–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and a scan speed of 32 s−1. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) (Model: Octane Plus) was used to study the elemental composition of the Au-coated samples and the distribution of metallic TiO2 NPs in the polymer matrix. The overall crystallinity of the different film samples was recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/max2200VPC, Japan) at diffraction angles of 2θ between 5 and 80°, with a scanning step of 0.4°/min, a voltage of 40 kV, and a current of 50 mA. Thermal analysis was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; STA 449C, Netsch, Germany), and measurements were made by increasing the temperature from 50 to 350 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under flowing nitrogen with approximately 1–2 mg samples [24]. The percentage of crystallinity (Xc) was calculated using the method described by Goudar et al. [25]: X c = Δ H e x p Δ H s t d × 100 where ΔHexp is the experimental melting enthalpy of the crystalline phase, and ΔHstd is the theoretical melting enthalpy of the PVA crystalline phase (138.7 J/g) [26]."
6,Mechanical properties of films,"2.5 Mechanical properties of films We adopted the method of Haghighi et al. to measure the tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) using an HD-B609B–S tensile tester (Haida International Equipment Co., Ltd.) [27]. Each film was cut into rectangular strips 60 mm long and 10 mm wide and the stretch speed was set at 50 mm min−1."
7,Color and light transmission,"2.6 Color and light transmission The color of the films was measured using a colorimeter (Sanenchi Handheld Colorimeter NR10QC, Shenzhen, China) at randomly selected points with a D65 illuminant. A standard white plate was used as the standard background for color measurement. The total color difference (ΔE∗) was determined as follows: Δ E = [ ( Δ a ) 2 + ( Δ L ) 2 + ( Δ b ) 2 ] 0.5 where ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb* are the differences between the film samples and the color values of the standard color plate, respectively. The T (%) of the different film samples was measured using a digital automatic photoelectric digital haze meter (WGW, Physical Optical Instruments Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China), wherein the haze meter was calibrated several times with a standard blackboard until the reading was stable; then, the membrane was placed directly into the instrument."
8,Water vapor permeability (WVP),"2.7 Water vapor permeability (WVP) The WVP was measured gravimetrically based on a standard method (ASTM E96/E96-10) (ASTM, 2013b), with slight modifications. During the test, 3 cm diameter discs were first cut from different sample films prepared independently, and the thicknesses of the different sample films were measured at five random points. The discs were sealed at the mouth of a glass tube containing silica gel (0% RH) and held in place with a 25 mm diameter O-ring. The assembly was then placed in a desiccator containing distilled water (100% RH) at 25 °C and 53% RH. At the same time, the desiccator was sealed to prevent water vapor leakage. Over a period of 15 d, the glass test tubes were weighed at a precision of 0.001 g every three days. Determinations were carried out in triplicate for different film samples, and the following formula was used to calculate the WVP: W V P = Δ w t × x A × Δ P where x is the film thickness (m), Δw is the weight change (g), A is the permeation area of the film (m2), t is time (h), and ΔP is the partial vapor pressure difference (Pa) between the dry atmosphere and water (2642 Pa at 25 °C)."
9,Biodegradability,"2.8 Biodegradability To explore the biodegradability of the composite film, we adopted the laboratory-scale soil degradation experiment method presented by Banhalee et al. with slight modifications [28]. Throughout the entire experiment, the soil ambient temperature was 18 ± 2 °C, relative humidity was 74 ± 6%, and pH value of the soil was 6.45 ± 0.05. Prior to testing, the samples were dried at 105 °C for 24 h and weighed to obtain the initial weight (W 0 ), and the mass of the membrane was recorded every 5 days (Wx). The weight loss of the samples was calculated using the following formula: Weight loss ( % ) = W 0 − W x W 0 × 100 %"
10,ROS quantitation,"2.9 ROS quantitation The method of Zhang et al. was adopted to measure the yields of two typical ROS (OH• and H2O2) to explore the photoactivity of the composite films [17]. A D65 standard daylight tube (GEF15T8/D) was used to simulate daylight exposure, and ROS generated by PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA composite films were measured using indirect spectrophotometry. p-Nitrosodimethylanilide (p-NDA) was proven to be a selective scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, and the yield of OH• can be quantified through the bleaching of p-NDA. In the quantitative test, 10 mg of each sample film was immersed in 10 ml of p-NDA (50 mM) and exposed to a D65 standard light source or dark conditions. The concentration of p-NDA in the solution was measured quantitatively by measuring the absorbance at 440 nm. The p-NDA calibration curve in H2O was established for the quantitative determination of the amount of OH• released by different samples under different exposure times, including p-NDA concentration before irradiation (C0) and residual concentration after exposure (C1); thus, the p-NDA consumption was determined. Hydroxyl radicals can oxidize p-NDA to an intermediate, and disproportionation reactions can occur between the two intermediates. One of them could be oxidized to a nitro species (not absorbing at 440 nm), thus resulting in fading, while the other reformed p-NDA. The stoichiometric ratio between the hydroxyl radical and p-NDA was 2:1, and the generated amount of hydroxyl radicals could be obtained. The yield of H2O2 was determined through an indirect spectrophotometric method following a standard operating procedure for analyzing the H2O2 concentrations in water (Procedure No: GSI/SOP/BS/RA/C/7, Issue Date: June 15, 2009) [20]. This particular method is consistent with the results of our previous study [23]."
11,Antimicrobial activity evaluation,"2.10 Antimicrobial activity evaluation The antibacterial performance of different composite films was assessed by two pathogenic bacteria: gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The antibacterial test was as follows: different samples (1 g) were immersed in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks. Then, a growth medium (50 mL) and the different microbial cell suspensions (1 mL) were added to different flasks and shaken at 120 rpm at 37 °C for 24 h, while a flask containing bacteria and a pure PVA film sample were used as controls [29]. After incubation for 24 h, 1 mL of bacterial culture was removed from each flask, and the suspension was serially diluted 10-fold. Diluted suspensions (0.1 mL) were plated onto triplicate nutrient agar plates using the spread plate method and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the number of viable cells (colonies) was recorded as the after-culture bacterial count and multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the mean colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. The antibacterial rate was calculated using the following formula: Mortality ( % ) = W t − Q t W t × 100 % where W t and Q t are the average number of bacteria grown after 24 h incubation for the control PVA film and different sample films, respectively."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis The performance of samples is determined by multiple parallel samples, and the data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Regarding the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the SPSS 19.0 Statistical Analysis System was used, in which the means were compared using Duncan's multiple interval test to determine which groups were significantly different from other groups (p < 0.05)."
13,Results and discussion,
14,Mechanism of photo-induced ROS generation,"3.1 Mechanism of photo-induced ROS generation Fig. 1 illustrates the mechanism of ROS production in BPTA-treated composite films. BPTA, as a photosensitive benzophenone derivative, can be excited to a singlet state upon exposure to daylight. When used as a photosensitive in photochemistry, the chromophore group of benzophenone undergoes light excitation and converts to the corresponding triplet state through intersystem crossing (ISC) [30]. The triplet excited state can be readily quenched by oxygen to generate 1O2 and can also react with a hydrogen atom abstraction from a suitable hydrogen donor to form a quinone group [19,31]. The photoactive cycle comprises the steps of excitation, dehydrogenation, and quenching [32,33], whereas quinone groups are quenched to yield ROS. With oxygen, the triplet-state quinone group may not be completely quenched, which may lead to some rearrangement of the structure and second hydrogen abstraction, resulting in the formation of a storage-active metastable structure [34]. As shown in the light-absorption transient structure of the samples, the structure has poor stability in the presence of oxygen, which can be readily converted to benzophenone and accompanied by the recovery of photosensitive activity [35]. Thus, it is easy to form and release ROS in BPTA-treated composite films, even under dim or completely dark conditions."
15,Morphology of composite films,"3.2 Morphology of composite films From the photomicrographs of the pure PVA film [Fig. 2 (a)] and PVA/BPTA [Fig. 2(b)], it is evident that the morphology underwent extreme changes and the smooth surface structure of PVA was transformed into a folded structure [36]. The same phenomenon was also observed for the PVA/0.75%TiO2 NPs/BPTA film. TiO2 NPs were relatively uniformly dispersed in the film, which proves that the ultrasonic dispersion and heating and stirring during the film preparation process successfully opened the TiO2 NP aggregates, resulting in a more uniform dispersion in the casting solution. Similar to the results of Heitz et al. [37], the NPs in the composite film modified by grafting were embedded in the PVA layer, as shown in Fig. 2(d). However, the homogeneous morphology of TiO2 NPs disappeared after grafting and became a heterogeneous morphology [36]. The surface chemical properties of TiO2 NPs determine the interaction and affect the binding between the NPs and the matrix. In the absence of grafting, only weak coordination is present between the TiO2 NPs and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the polyvinyl alcohol, and only a weak bond exists between the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the PVA and TiO2 NP aggregates [8]. TEM clearly shows the degree of dispersion of titanium dioxide (Fig. 2(e)). Pure TiO2 NPs are adequately aggregated; thus, ultrasonic dispersion is essential. Similar to the results of XRD, the lattice fringe distance obtained by HRTEM is 0.37 nm, which corresponds to the (101) diffraction direction of anatase TiO2 [13]. Because TiO2 NPs were lost or embedded in the PVA, the specific distribution of TiO2 NPs was analyzed using EDAX energy dispersion analysis. Fig. 3 presents the results of EDS mapping, which shows the incorporation and distribution of TiO2 NPs throughout the hybrid PVA thin film. The existence of the characteristic peak of Ti proved that TiO2 NPs were successfully incorporated into the films. Fig. 3(a)–(b) show a more uniform dispersion, in which 0.5 and 1 wt% of TiO2 NPs were incorporated, respectively. Fig. 3(c) depicts the reduced uniformity caused by the partial loss of TiO2 (1 wt%) in the PVA chain during grafting. The quantitative results of the investigated spectra (5.23 wt%, 23.75 wt%, and 4.85 wt%, respectively) clearly demonstrated the existence of Ti in the sample structures and confirmed the loss of TiO2 NPs during the grafting process, thus resulting in a Ti content in PVA/1% TiO2 NPs/BPTA that was only equivalent to PVA/0.5% TiO2 NPs/BPTA. The decrease in the Ti content after grafting was similar to that reported by Zhang et al. where the cross-linking process was soaked in the corresponding solution, resulting in a change in the distribution of TiO2, which became sparse. Moreover, some aggregates were randomly distributed on the top surface [10]. In summary, the distribution of the TiO2 NPs inside the polymer matrix was substantially uniform."
16,XRD analysis,"3.3 XRD analysis Owing to the inter- and intra-chain hydrogen bonding of PVA, the PVA polymer exhibits a typical semi-crystalline structure with a strong 2θ peak at approximately 19.55°, as shown in Fig. 4 (a) [15]. The PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA sample film presents anatase crystalline phases, with significant differences in the relative intensities between the peaks corresponding to different crystal planes to the peak intensity of the pure TiO2 sample [12]. The highest-intensity peaks for the TiO2 NPs and PVA/0.75% TiO2 NPs/BPTA samples corresponded to the anatase (101) planes, and the (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) diffraction peaks are also attributed to the tetragonal anatase TiO2 phase, which is in line with JCPDS 21–1272 [38]. The incorporation of TiO2 into PVA interfered with the polymer chain through the steric effect and hydrogen bonding between PVA and TiO2 NPs. The hydroxyl group became more terminally extended, which made the crystalline structure rigid, resulting in reduced crystallinity of the PVA polymer [39]. In addition, the intermolecular complexation between PVA and BPTA during the grafting process affected the crystallization of PVA. These are the two main reasons that the peak of the PVA/0.75%TiO2 NPs/BPTA composite film was weaker and narrower at 19.8° than that of the pure PVA sample."
17,FTIR analysis,"3.4 FTIR analysis According to the results of the FTIR-ATR spectroscopy in Fig. 4(b), pure PVA shows the tensile and bending vibration spectral characteristics of several peaks–OH, C–H, and C–O groups, and characteristic peaks at 3293, 2922, 1328 and 1090 cm−1, representing –OH stretching, C–H stretching, C–H bending, and C–O stretching, respectively [40]. The band between 650 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1 was attributed to Ti–O–Ti stretching bands, while the peak around 1110 cm−1 shows stretching vibrations of Ti–O–Ti [38]. The absorption peaks around 1388 cm−1 and 1635 cm−1 can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of O–O groups and the characteristic peak of water, respectively. The peak at 3435 cm−1, which is related to hydroxyl (O–H) stretching, was detected in pure TiO2 NPs, thereby describing the water as moisture [41]. In the presence of TiO2 NPs, owing to the intensified interaction between the PVA-OH group and TiO2 NPs, the spectral band of the composite film at 1374 cm−1 shifted to a higher wavenumber. This interaction limits the oscillation of the external bending plane and PVA-OH group, thus affecting the migration and physical cross-linking of the PVA chain [42]. The COOH peak of pure BPTA was located at 1700 cm−1, while the asymmetric and symmetric vibration peaks of the carboxyl group in BPTA were located at 1621 cm−1 and 1440 cm−1, respectively. In the spectra of the PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA film, peaks at 1586 cm−1 and 1230 cm−1 were assigned to ester O–CO and C–O moieties, respectively [43]. Moreover, the spectrum of the PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA film has a new ester peak at 1722 cm−1, which indicates that PVA and BPTCD were successfully combined during the grafting process [44]."
18,DSC measurements,"3.5 DSC measurements The DSC curves of both the pure PVA film and the PVA-based composite film were analyzed, and an endothermic peak was observed at approximately 85 °C, which corresponds to the glass transition temperature (Tg) in Fig. 4(c). Compared with pure PVA, all the PVA-based composite films show an increased Tg, which may be due to the addition of strong intermolecular interactions between different components, and the increase in intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which restricts the movement of the polymer chain [26]. In addition, the PVA film has an endothermic peak at 208.4 °C (Table 1) , which is related to the melting temperature (Tm) of the PVA film [10]. The Tm of the samples increased to different extents after the addition of the TiO2 NPs. Moreover, the decomposition of PVA and PVA/TiO2 NPs was notably higher at a temperature of approximately 320 °C; the addition of BPTA could solve this problem. The thermogram of pure BPTA has an endothermic peak at approximately 214.1 °C. Different crystallization rates lead to differences in crystallization time, making the exothermic peak of pure BPTA sharper than that of the PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA composite film. The calculated crystallinities of the pure PVA film and the PVA-based composite film were 36% and 32%, indicating that the addition of BPTA and TiO2 NPs reduced the crystallinity, which is consistent with the XRD results. Abnormal peaks observed in the DSC curve for PVA/BPTA and PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA composite films may be caused by catalyst sodium hypophosphite residue on the film surface from the grafting process."
19,Mechanical properties,"3.6 Mechanical properties As shown in Fig. 5 (a), TS and EAB of the PVA/TiO2 NP composite film increased to a certain extent, indicating that the addition of TiO2 NPs can improve the mechanical properties of the pure PVA film and exhibit a certain regularity. However, with the increase in the mass fraction of TiO2 NPs, both TS and EAB of the composite materials demonstrated a trend, wherein it increased at first and then started decreasing. When the TiO2 NP concentration increased to 0.75%, the TS of the composite films had a maximum value of 165.82 ± 1.73 MPa. After the addition of TiO2 NPs, it forms a hydrogen bond with the PVA, and the nanomaterial instigates anisotropic nucleation in the polymer. This improves the crystallization performance of the polymer and thus increases the TS of the composite material. However, further increasing the mass fraction of TiO2 NPs may lead to agglomeration, thus resulting in the uneven dispersion of PVA, which may reduce the contact area and interaction between the nanomaterials and the polymer and reduce the TS and EAB of the composite films to a certain extent [45]. The grafting of low-concentration BPTA significantly reduced the EAB and TS of the composite film. This phenomenon may be due to the intermolecular force generated by the cross-linking of organic materials in the film matrix, which changes the interfacial adhesion between BPTA and the matrix [46]. Moreover, the addition of BPTA interrupted the cohesion of the polymer chain, while the hydrogen bond formed during the grafting process of the PVA matrix caused the flexibility of the composite film to decrease."
20,Water vapor permeability,"3.7 Water vapor permeability The WVP values of the different samples are presented in Table 2 . WVP of the pure PVA film was 11.02 ± 0.32 × 10−13 g Pa−1 s−1cm−1 and this declined significantly (p < 0.05) after blending with TiO2 NPs. Among the PVA/TiO2 NP films, the composite film with the lowest TiO2 NP content (PVA/0.5%TiO2 NPs) exhibited the lowest WVP of 8.54 ± 0.12 × 10−13 g Pa−1 s−1 cm−1. With increasing TiO2 NP concentration, the WVP of the composite films increased gradually. However, the WVP of the PVA/TiO2 NP films was still lower than that of the pure PVA film. The NPs exhibiting such different effects on the WVP may be ascribed to various factors such as the type of polymer substrate, filler concentration, and compatibility between the polymer matrix and nanofillers [47]. The main reason for reduction in WVP can be attributed to the addition of TiO2, which resulted in the formation of a tighter and more complex network structure, which increased the diffusion path length of water vapor, thereby reducing the diffusion and solubility coefficients [48]. When the TiO2 NP concentration was 0.75%, the WVP of the film increased. This behavior was attributed to the agglomeration of TiO2 NPs, which led to a decrease in the number of TiO2 NPs that can play an important role, leading to an increase in WVP [45]. Similar to the results of previous studies, grafting BPTA resulted in a decrease in the WVP of the composite film, which was attributed to a concomitant decrease in film hydrophilicity owing to ester bond formation upon BPTA grafting [23]."
21,Surface color and light transmittance,"3.8 Surface color and light transmittance Table 2 shows the surface color and optical properties of pure PVA and composite films. The addition of TiO2 NPs significantly increased the lightness, a-values, and b-values, compared with pure PVA (p < 0.05). The increase in L-values occurs because TiO2 NPs have excellent brightness, and a low concentration of TiO2 NPs will increase the whiteness of the film [45]. As the concentration TiO2 NPs increased, the L-values and a-values of the composite film increased, but b-values decreased, indicating that the brightness and the redness of the film increased while the yellowness decreased. However, during the grafting process, the brightness (L-values) slightly decreased and the yellowness (b-values) significantly increased (p < 0.05), which was due to the yellow color of BPTA and decrease in TiO2 NPs. Consequently, due to the addition of TiO2 NPs and BPTA, the total color difference (ΔE) for the composite films increased significantly (p < 0.05). It can be seen from Table 2 that the pure PVA film has the best light transmittance, up to 90.08 ± 0.01%. As the mass fraction of TiO2 NPs increased, the light transmittance of the composite film gradually decreased, which was significant (p < 0.05). This phenomenon may be due to the scattering and refraction effects of nano-TiO2 on light. TiO2 NPs have a larger specific surface area and higher specific surface area refractive index, which can prevent visible light from being transmitted from the surface of the film [49]. The addition of BPTA resulted in the transmittance of the composite film decreasing significantly under visible light, with the lowest value occurring for the PVA/1%TiO2 NPs/BPTA film (36.34 ± 0.11%), which was 59.66% lower than that of the pure PVA film. The grafting process resulted in a dramatic decrease in the light transmittance of the composite film due to the chemical reaction between BPTA and PVA, under the action that the catalyst destroyed the original network structure of the film, and it interacted with the possible agglomeration of TiO2 NPs, which further hindered the light transmission."
22,Antibacterial activity,"3.9 Antibacterial activity To test the suitability of the prepared composite film for use as an antibacterial film for biomedical applications, the antibacterial activity of the composite films was tested through the contact killing bacteria experiment; gram-negative E. coli and gram-positive S. aureus were used as two bacterial types in this study. As shown in Fig. 6 , the pure PVA film did not show any antimicrobial activity against either of the bacteria. Compared with the control group, the composite film displayed better antibacterial properties for the two kinds of bacteria. In addition, the antibacterial ability was improved owing to the increase in the TiO2 NP quality ratio. SEM revealed that the grafting process could cause the loss of TiO2 NPs. However, by comparing the inhibition rates of PVA/0.25%TiO2 NPs and PVA/0.25%TiO2 NPs/BPTA, it was concluded that even though the number of antibacterial particles was reduced during the grafting process, the addition of BPTA still enhanced the antibacterial efficiency of the PVA/TiO2 NP composite film. After treatment with PVA/1%TiO2 NPs/BPTA for 24 h, the surviving populations of S. aureus and E. coli in the experimental group decreased by 99.62 ± 0.38% and 98.27 ± 1.47%, respectively, compared with the control group. The above bactericidal results can be attributed to the destruction of the plasma membrane and cell wall with the leakage of pathogen cytoplasmic content, which leads to the successful destruction of the bacteria [50]. As indicated by the research of Pencheva et al. the cell wall structures of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms are different: the peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria is very thin, and the outer membrane is wrapped in 23 outer membranes, which complicates the structure and chemical composition of gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the composite films were stronger against S. aureus than against E. coli [51]."
23,Biodegradability,"3.10 Biodegradability To evaluate the biodegradability of the PVA composite films, a soil embedding test was used to evaluate the weight loss of the films over a period of 20 d (Fig. 5(b)). After exposure to soil, the film became sticky and soft, and reduced in size. After 20 d of exposure to soil, the film experienced considerable weight loss, which indicates degradation by microorganisms in the soil, and the degradation rate of all composite films was faster than that of the pure PVA film (p < 0.05). After 20 d, by comparing PVA/0.25%TiO2 NPs (39.02 ± 5.3%) and PVA/0.25%TiO2 NPs/BPTA (41.87 ± 2.02%), it was found that, under the same TiO2 NP concentration, the addition of BPTA had a certain effect on the biodegradation rate. This may be due to the chemical grafting process that affects the original network structure of the film; however, it is not significant and only increases by 7.3%. However, the degradation rates of PVA/0.25%TiO2 NPs/BPTA and PVA/0.5%TiO2 NPs/BPTA composite films were 41.87 ± 2.02% and 42.3 ± 2.43%, which were 24.01% and 27.5% higher than that of the pure PVA film (33.71 ± 3.09%), respectively. PVA is biodegradable, and the water in the soil can easily penetrate the polymer network, thereby weakening the polymer chains and making them easily hydrolyzed by soil microorganisms [52]. Simultaneously, because of the presence of the surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 NPs, they were easily adsorbed on the surface of the polymer, and the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 NPs partly converted PVA into CO2 and H2O. In addition, TiO2 NPs easily formed agglomerates and were unevenly dispersed in the PVA matrix at a high concentration, thus forming a weak region in the composite film, thereby accelerating water absorption-induced swelling and promoting degradation [53]. Similar to the results of Kawasaki et al. because of the high concentration of TiO2 NPs, the surface area of microbes and their enzymes on the composite film were smaller, and the degradation efficiency did not increase with increasing TiO2 NP concentration [54]."
24,Analysis of ROS production,"3.11 Analysis of ROS production To quantify the rechargeability of ROS, we first exposed the sample films to 1 h of daylight irradiation, and then measured the production of OH• and H2O2 per 10 min. Consistent with our previous research, more than 90% of ROS in all the samples were released rapidly in the first 10 min and reached a relative balance (Fig. 7 (a)–(b)) [23]. Some studies have claimed that TiO2 demonstrates excellent antibacterial activity only in the UV wavelength range; almost no antibacterial activity was observed under visible light irradiation [13]. From studying the PVA/0.25% TiO2 NP film, it was found that TiO2 can produce ROS for sterilization under visible light, but the yield is low. This result is consistent with that of Chen et al. who used the DCFH-DA probe fluorescence method to determine the ROS content of TiO2 under UVA and visible light. By comparing the fluorescence intensity of the stained bacterial solution, they concluded that TiO2 can also produce ROS under visible light, but the effect was worse than that under UVA; moreover, this method cannot quantitatively determine the specific ROS content [55]. As expected, the PVA/1% TiO2 NPs/BPTA film exhibited the highest charging capacity. The number of OH• radicals produced was determined by the number of benzophenone moieties on the film. At the same BPTA concentration, TiO2 NPs had little effect on ROS production. After 1 h of daytime 24 charging, the release of OH• and H2O2 was 1749.35 and 483.71 μg g−1, respectively, corresponding to the charging rates of 129.16 and 8.06 μg g−1 min −1, respectively, showing that large amounts of light energy were used. Cyclic irradiation tests (Fig. 7(c)–(d)) were carried out on PVA/1% TiO2 NPs/BPTA samples with a 30-min-interval light-dark fatigue cycle. It was found that OH• and H2O2 were produced during the irradiation period and remained stable in the dark. This result was combined with the mechanism of ROS production (Fig. 1), and the amount of ROS increased only in the presence of light, which is consistent with previous reports [34]. Then, by quenching, ROS were produced and the production was reinitiated by inducing light, and the reusability of the composite films was explored through seven cycles to evaluate the economic feasibility of its practical application. PVA/1% TiO2 NPs/BPTA was used for the measurements. In each cycle, the sample was first irradiated for 1 h, and after each measurement, the excess thiosulfate solution was used to completely quench the generated ROS. The results are shown in Fig. 7(e). After seven cycles, no significant decrease in charge capacity was observed; that is, the composite film maintained 81.01% and 66.12% of its original OH• and H2O2 charge capacities, respectively. This demonstrates the structural stability of the sample film, which can be used as an antimicrobial material for multiple applications."
25,Conclusions,"In this study, PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA films were successfully prepared by solvent casting and chemical grafting. The results showed that, as TiO2 NPs were lost or embedded in the matrix, the homogeneous morphology of TiO2 NPs was lost after grafting and changed into a heterogeneous morphology. Through the antibacterial test, the PVA/1%TiO2 NPs/BPTA film was found to be more antibacterial than other films, with antibacterial rates of 99.62 ± 0.38% and 98.27 ± 1.47% against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. Finally, by quantitatively measuring the amount of ROS produced by the composite films under light and dark conditions, it was concluded that PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA can produce ROS in both cases, and the mechanism of ROS production was discussed. The cycling experiment after quenching ROS showed that the best-performing composite film (PVA/1%TiO2 NPs/BPTA) still maintained 81.01% and 66.12% of the original charging capacity of the OH• radical and H2O2 after seven cycles. Thus, the PVA/TiO2 NPs/BPTA film is a promising antibacterial material that offers the benefits of a stable structure and reusability that can work under light and dark conditions."
