0,Introduction,"Compared with non-renewable fossil fuels, sunlight and water resources are abundant and easily accessible renewable energy sources on the earth [1,2]. Therefore, the solar energy for splitting water to evolution hydrogen based on semiconductors has broad prospects in solving energy crisis and environmental pollution [3–6]. Current photocatalysts for water decomposition could not be applied to industrial production attribute to the main factors of high cost, low activity and poor stability [6]. The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), composed of sp2 hybridization of carbon and nitrogen is a polymeric organic semiconductor that considered to be a highly promising multifunctional material since its simple preparation process [7,8], suitable band gap, and good chemical stability which was first reported by Prof. Wang in 2009 [9]. Unfortunately, the bulk g-C3N4 prepared by conventional thermal polymerization methods has a limited specific surface area, and the lifetime of photogenerated carriers is reduced due to the influence of π-π conjugated electron system restrict the utilization of g-C3N4 in water decomposition [10–12]. Benefit by the high work function and suitable free energy of H-atom adsorption, the high hydrogen precipitation activity of g-C3N4 can be obtained by modifying with precious metals (Pt, Au, Ru) as co-catalysts [13–15]. However, the extreme expensiveness and rareness limited their practical applications [16,17]. Numerous efforts, including such as the construction of heterojunctions, the doping of heteroatoms, and copolymerization with organic molecules are used to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced carriers to enhance the hydrogen production activity of g-C3N4, but none of them have completely overcome the inherent defects of g-C3N4 [18,19]. Heterojunctions can reduce the compounding of photogenerated carriers and short electron transfer channels, but at the expense of reducing the redox ability of the sacrificial reagent [20]; heteroatoms doping expand the absorbance intensity of g-C3N4 as well as change the band gap, but the isolated states formed will becomes the compounding center of the photoinduced carriers [21]; the copolymerization of organic molecules can change the energy band structure of g-C3N4, but only very few organic molecules will attach to the texture edges of g-C3N4 [18,22]. Adsorption is a key aspect in multiphase catalytic reactions which is highly dependent on the microstructure of the catalysts, changes in structure directly affect the number and distribution of adsorption sites [23]. Therefore, different forms of g-C3N4 are designed and prepared, such as: thin layered [24], hollow sphere [25], hollow tubes [26,27], etc. Compared to pristine bulk g-C3N4, thin layered g-C3N4 is equipped rich in surface reaction sites, but tends to laminar stacking, which can lead to loss of active sites and the decrease of specific surface area [28]; the hollow tube g-C3N4 utilizes the inner cavity to achieve multiple scattering and reflection of incident light, and the carriers generated by the light excitation will migrate directionally along a one-dimensional (1D) path [29]. The honeycomb g-C3N4 prepared in this experiment is endowed with a large cavity, has a unique slow photon effect, and can delay and store a specific incident wavelength [28]. On the whole, the three-dimensional (3D) g-C3N4 structure has a large specific surface area, abundant active sites, shortened carrier diffusion paths, and convenient channels that could facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of reactants [30]. As a typical transition-metal carbide (TMC), molybdenum carbide has a simple preparation process, low cost and good stability, and has excellent H+ adsorption properties and d-band electronic density of states comparable to precious metals [31–33]. It has been extensively investigated in the fields of hydrodesulfurization, water gas transfer, photocatalytic hydrogen production, etc. Unfortunately, Mo2C prepared by high-temperature calcination has a large particle size and is tends to agglomeration. Liu et al. [34] overcame this challenge by growing MoC2 nanoparticles on rGo under calcination at 800 °C, and coupling them to TiO2. However, high-temperature calcination still has potential safety hazards. The method of synthesizing cubic MoC at a lower temperature is safer [35]. Although the carbon film cannot generate photo-generated carriers, its excellent conductivity facilitates the transport of electrons. Furthermore, rational anchoring of the catalyst on the carbon film is then an effective strategy. Shi et al. [36] covered CdS with a carbon film and loaded Zn on the outer surface of the carbon film, to increase the overall hydrogen production of the composite catalyst by 4.7 times compared to pure CdS. Under the guidance of the above ideas, this experiment successfully grown a large number of highly dispersed MoC-QDs on the carbon film, and coupled with a small amount of g-C3N4 with different morphologies. Under visible light irradiation, the hydrogen evolution of MoCB-15, MoCT-7, and MoCH-5 are 2.03, 3.14, and 3.58 times that of MoC-30, respectively, which proves that matching catalysts with different morphologies is an effective strategy to improve performance. This research conducted an in-depth analysis of the causes of performance differences through a series of analytical methods, and proposed possible reaction mechanisms."
1,Experimental section,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of the g-C3N4 and MoC-QDs/C-x Use heat shrinkage method to synthesize bulk g-C3N4. Put the crucible containing 6 g of melamine into the muffle furnace, keep the heating rate at 5 °C/min, and calcine at 550 °C for 2 h. The final product was named CN-B. The specific preparation steps of tubular g-C3N4 [26,27]: 1 g (8 mmol) of melamine was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water and stirred vigorously in a water bath at 85 °C for 0.5 h. Then it was transferred to a Teflon-lined while it was heated to 180 °C for 10 h. The mixture was washed and centrifuged and then dried in an oven. Finally, it was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 2.5 °C/min in N2 atmosphere. The final product was named CN-T. Honeycomb g-C3N4 was synthesized by air chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Refer to the published literature and use Stöber method to synthesize SiO2 nanospheres [37]. Typically, the mixed solution of 45.5 mL tetraethoxysilane and 45.5 mL absolute ethanol was stirred for 10 min, and then the above mixed solution was added to the 147 mL deionized water, 283 mL alcohol and 70 mL NH3 . 2H2O (28%) and stirred vigorously for 24 h. The milky white liquid produced by the reaction is washed several times with ethanol and water to obtain uniform SiO2 nanospheres. 3 g of melamine was added to the crucible, and then the SiO2 microsphere template was evenly covered on it. Control the temperature at 320 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and then increase it to 550 °C for 3 h at the same rate. 114.8 g of NH4HF2 was dissolved in 410 mL of deionized water, and the calcined mixture was soaked statically for 12 h. After washing, centrifugation and drying, the final product was obtained, which was named CN-H. The specific preparation process of MoC-QDs/C-x is as follows [33]. Firstly, solution A was prepared: x mmol (x = 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25) of melamine was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h. Then add dilute hydrochloric acid solution (1 mol/L) drop by drop to adjust the pH of the suspension solution to 4. Solution B was prepared: 0.5 mmol (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O was dissolved in 15 mL ethanol and 60 mL deionized water. Slowly add solution B dropwise into solution A, place it in a water bath at 90 °C and stir vigorously until it evaporates, and place it in an oven for drying. Calcined at 500 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min in N2 atmosphere, and then heated to 700 °C for 1 h. The final catalysts are named MoC-QDs/C-x (x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50). This experiment focuses on MoC-QDs/C-30, so it is simply named MoC-30. 2.1.2 Preparation of the composite catalyst Add 0.05 g CN-B, 0.03 g CN-T, and 0.01 g CN-H to a beaker containing 1 g MoC-30 and 60 mL alcohol respectively. After 10 min of ultrasonic treatment, continue to stir in a water bath at 60 °C until it evaporates. The three composite catalysts were named MoCB-5, MoCT-3, MoCH-1."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystal structure of products was tested with an X-ray diffraction (XRD), adopting Cu Kα radiation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a ZEISS EVO 10. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected by an ESCALAB Xi+. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) was performed with a FEI Tecnai TF 20. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra ware investigated using a FTIR-650. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) ware recorded with PerkinElmer Lambda-750, adopting BaSO4 as the reference. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution curve were collected on micromeritics (ASAP 2460). The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were taken on the FluoroMax-4 and Fluorohub-B. The electrochemical property of products was recorded in Na2SO4 0.5 M aqueous solutions by the workstation (VersaSTAT4-400, AMETEK) that own standard three-electrode cell, and the light used in the electrochemical test was a xenon lamp source (Microsolar300, Beijing Perfectlight). The working electrode was prepared by the FTO glass (1 × 1 cm2) coated samples (5 mg), ethanol and Nafion solution (1:9). The Mott-Schottky (MS) was recorded using different frequency."
4,Photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments The photocatalytic H2 production performance of samples was investigated by the multi-channel photochemical reaction system (PCX-50B, Beijing Perfectlight). The 10 mg samples, 10 mg Eosin Y (EY) and 30 mL 15% v/v TEOA solution as sacrifice reagent were added in the sealed system. The sealed system was filled with N2 and kept stirring. Then, the content of hydrogen produced through light irradiation was evaluated by a gas chromatography (GC-7900)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,XRD and FT-IR analysis,"3.1 XRD and FT-IR analysis Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to study the crystallinity and crystal structure of all catalysts. In this experiment, MoC-QDs/C-x with different crystalline phases is synthesized by varying the doping amount of the C source while controlling the quality of the Mo source to be constant ( Fig. 1 a). Hexagonal MoC (PDF#6-546) is first synthesized after adding 2.5 mmol of melamine; when melamine is increased to 5 mmol, MoC changed to hexagonal MoC-QDs/C-10 (PDF#65-8364); the addition of excess C source led to the synthesis of stable cubic MoC (PDF# 65-280). MoC-QDs/C-50 shows four diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.4°, 42.22°, 61.33° and 73.38°, which are assigned to (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of cubic MoC (PDF#, 65-280). Fig. S1a shows the XRD patterns of MoC-QDs/C-x synthesized from different qualities of melamine, revealing the close correlation between the C source content and the crystal phase transition process. The inset is an enlarged view of it at 12–30°, which advantageously proves the existence of carbon film [35]. In particular, MoC-QDs/C-15 has both hexagonal MoC-QDs/C-10 and cubic MoC crystal phases. In Fig. 1 b, CN-B and CN-H can detect two obvious diffraction peaks. Among them, CN-B has the highest crystallinity, and the lower diffraction peak of CN-H may be because the SiO2 template method destroys the crystal structure of g-C3N4. CN-T can only detect the diffraction peak at 27.3º, which is related to the reduction of repeating units in the planar direction of the tubular structure, in agreement with previous reports in the literature [26,27,38]. The characteristic peak at 13° is assigned to the (100) crystal plane, indicating that there are stacks of tri-s-triazine structures in-plane structural [39]; 27.4° peak is assigned to the (002) plane corresponding to the interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic systems. The XRD of all ratios of the composite catalysts MoCB-x, MoCT-x and MoCH-x are shown in Fig. S1b -d, with the characteristic peaks of MoC and g-C3N4 respectively marked. The diffraction peaks of the composite catalysts have no obvious peak position shift, indicating that the crystal structure distance of the two catalysts has not changed. The FTIR spectra of samples in the range of 500–4000 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 1 c. Different morphologies of g-C3N4 have similar characteristic peaks, the sharp absorption peak at 800 cm−1 comes from the bending vibration of tris-s-triazine unit [40]. The absorption band during the scope of 1200–1650 cm−1 is owing to stretching vibration of the C-N aromatic ring, and the broadband between 3000 and 3400 cm−1 is attributed to the amino groups [41]."
7,SEM and TEM analysis,"3.2 SEM and TEM analysis The morphologies and microstructures of the pure catalysts, MoCB-15, MoCT-7, and MoCH-5 are characterized by SEM and TEM images. In Fig. 2 a, MoC-30 formed by high-temperature calcination has a wrinkled and curled thin-layer cloth-like structure, indicating that the preparation of the carbon film is successful, and the MoC-QDs cannot be observed due to the small size. CN-B (Fig. 2 b) is a large block with smooth surface and stable structure. For the composite catalyst MoCB-15 in Fig. S2a, CN-B is tightly surrounded by the carbon film, which is beneficial to improve the electron transfer efficiency. In the Fig. 2 d, the large specific surface area of hollow tubular g-C3N4 facilitates the multiple reflection of incident light. Figs. 2 e, S2a, d show the SEM pictures of MoCT-10, MoCB-15 and MoCh-5, the carbon film coating g-C3N4 is beneficial to increase the contact area and shorten the electron transfer path. Additionally, the carbon film in the inner cavity plays a supporting role to prevent the collapse of the tubular structure. In Fig. S2b, the particle size of the well-dispersed SiO2 nanospheres is mainly concentrated at 300–500 nm. Fig. S2c presents a honeycomb-like g-C3N4, on which corrosion traces of SiO2 were observed at higher magnification (Fig. 2 c). In all composite catalysts, the agglomeration of the curled and wrinkled carbon film will cause a decrease in the specific surface area. To further confirm the presence of MoC-QDs, the MoCT-5 and MoCH-5 are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In Fig. 3 a, it is easy to observe that the tubular g-C3N4 is tightly surrounded by the carbon film. The very thin wall thickness of the tubular g-C3N4 is shown in Fig. 3 b, with a number of irregular cloth-like clinging to the g-C3N4. In Fig. 3 d, CN-H presents the spherical cavities remaining after etching SiO2, and the existence of carbon film. In the partial enlarged view (Fig. 3 e), dense MoC-QDs are distributed on the ultra-thin carbon film. In a high-resolution TEM (Figs. 3 c, 3 f), the red and yellow circle is used to mark the lattice fringe in the range of 2–5 nm. The lattice fringe of 0.247 nm is correspond to the (111) lattice plane of MoC, which proves that we have successfully synthesized MoC-QDs. Moreover, the area without lattice fringes is the carbon layer."
8,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis The chemical state of all samples is identified by XPS. It can be seen from Fig. 4 a that the catalysts all have three elements of C, N and O, which proves that the preparation of g-C3N4 is successful. With regards to C 1 s spectrum (Figs. 4 b), 284.8, 286.21, and 288.33 eV are attributed to graphitic carbon (CC), CO bonds, with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in NC-N [42]. The disappearance of CN-T's peak at 286.21 eV is related to calcined in N2 atmosphere. For the N 1s in Fig. 4 c, the peaks at 398.06, 398.94, and 400.39 eV are attributed to the C-NC, three-coordinated N atoms, and C-N-H groups, respectively [26]. The XPS full spectrum of MoC-30, MoCB-15, MoCT-7 and MoCH-5 is shown in Fig. 4 d, the composite catalyst including MoC-30 and g-C3N4 proved that the preparation was successful. Peaks around 400 eV can be assigned to Mo 3p orbital of MoC [43]. In the Fig. 4 e–g, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum of MoC-30 can be deconvolved into four peaks respectively assigned to (283.75 eV) MoC, (284.79 eV) CC, (286.03 eV) CO, and (288.46 eV) OCO bonds, which indicates that there is a part of sp2 hybrid carbon in MoC-30 [44]. The Mo 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 4 h) are split into 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, which are related to the characteristics of spin-orbital coupling [35]. The peaks at 228.97 and 232.04 eV belong to Mo3+ 3d5/2/3d3/2, corresponding to the + 3 oxidation state of Mo. The low oxidation state of Mo is considered to be the main active site in the hydrogen evolution reaction [12]. The (229.99 and 234.95 eV) Mo4+ 3d5/2/3d3/2 and (233.01 and 236.17 eV) Mo6+ 3d5/2/3d3/2 correspond to MoO2 and MoO3, which is caused by slight oxidation of the catalyst surface [45]. In Fig. 4, the binding energies of the composite catalysts undergo varying degrees of shift compared to pure g-C3N4, MoC-30, indicating that electron transfer occurs between the two catalysts upon binding."
9,Photocatalytic activity analysis,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity analysis Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen evolution activities of all catalysts in 15% (v/v) TEOA solution. Fig. 5 a intuitively reflects the relationship between the degree of dispersion of MoC-QDs on the carbon film and the photocatalytic H2 production activities. MoC-QDs/C-5 has the least amount of hydrogen activities, indicating that the excessive density of MoC-QDs inhibits the H2 evolution rate. The highest hydrogen evolution rate of MoC-30 indicating that MoC-QDs has good dispersibility on the carbon film which is make for the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The further increase of carbon source makes MoC-QDs sparsely scattered on the excessive carbon film that result in the lack of hydrogen evolution sites, so that lead to the gradually decreased activity. In Fig. 5 b, the H2 production activity of g-C3N4 is generally poor, stemming from rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and low light absorption. The optimal hydrogen production of the three composite catalysts in TEOA solution (pH = 9) with 10 mg of EY added for 5 h is shown in Fig. 5 c. Although the hydrogen production of CN-T and CN-H is not as good as that of CN-B, the hydrogen production of MoCT-7 and MoCH-5 are 1.54 and 1.76 times that of MoCB-15, respectively. The experimental results of Fig. 5 b and Fig. 5 c show that cleverly matching of nanomaterials with different morphologies is of great significance for improving performance. Fig. 5 d–f recorded in detail the H2 evolution capability per hour for different proportions of MoCB-x, MoCT-x, and MoCH-x. The increase activity of the composite catalyst may result from: i) Carbon film increases the transfer of electrons; ii) g-C3N4 and EY are the main providers of electrons, ensuring that abundant electrons participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction. iii) the work functions of MoC ranges from 4.23 to 7.47 eV. It has electron acceptor properties and is the main active site for the hydrogen evolution reduction reaction; iv) the close interface contact between MoC-30 and g-C3N4 with different morphologies shortens the electron transfer path. The stabilities of the MoCB-15, MoCT-7, and MoCH-5 are evaluated and shown in Fig. S3a–c, where the red line represents the addition of 10 mg EY, and the blue line represents no increase in EY. The composite catalysts almost maintained their original hydrogen evolution activity after 9 cycles of continuous irradiation, indicating its good stability and durability. This can be attributed to the structural stability of the catalysts: both honeycomb and bulk g-C3N4 have a stable structure that are not easy to change; the carbon membrane adsorbed in the inner cavity can support the tubular structure, effectively preventing rupture and collapse. In the dye sensitized systems, the pH of the sacrificial reagent and the EY addition amount have a great influence on the activity of the catalyst, so it has important research value. In Fig. 6 a–c reflect the hydrogen evolution activity of MoCB-15, MoCT-7 and MoCH-5 in pH 9, 10 solutions with the addition of 10 mg EY. When the pH of the solution lower than 9, high H+ concentration leads to TEOA protonation [46]; in an over-alkali solution, the decrease of H+ concentration can weaken the thermodynamic driving force of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Fig. 6 d–f explored the effect of different EY quality in the same sacrificial reagent on hydrogen production activity. Because a small amount of EY molecules cannot provide abundant electrons, which reduces the light absorption of the catalyst and decreases the number of electrons participating in the reaction [47]; excessive EY tends to accumulate on the surface of the catalyst and disperse into the solution, and cannot participate in the process of electron transport [48]."
10,BET surface areas and pore size distributions,"3.5 BET surface areas and pore size distributions The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore structure of the samples were analyzed by using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. According to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification, all the samples in the Fig. 7 are type IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loop. The BET surface area of materials is usually closely related to microstructure. The inner cavity and outer wall of the thin layer of CN-T and the spherical cavities remaining after the SiO2 is corroded all lead to the expansion of the BET surface area. In Table 1, the BET surface area of CN-T (21.43 m2g−1) and CN-H (35.20 m2g−1) are 2.5 and 4.1 times higher than that of CN-B (8.60 m2g−1), respectively. Larger surface area can provide sites for dye adsorption [47]. BET surface area of MoC-30 is as high as 59.86 m2 g−1, which is because MoC-30 has a fluffy and curled thin layer structure. The decrease in the BET surface areas of the composite catalysts is related to the change in the morphology of the carbon film. According to the pore diameter distribution curve in the illustration, the pore size of the catalysts is mainly concentrated in 2–50 nm, indicating that the sample has mesoporous characteristics. Combining with hydrogen production diagrams in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the BET surface area does not a decisive factor in the catalytic performance."
11,UV–vis DRS analysis,"3.6 UV–vis DRS analysis The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of MoC-30, CN-B, CN-T and CN-H are shown in Fig. 8 a. The black MoC-30 exhibits excellent light absorption. The different morphologies of g-C3N4 exhibit approximately the same absorption band, originating from the jump of charge from the N 2p orbital on VB to the C 2p orbital on CB [49]. The intrinsic absorption edge of CN-H and CN-T appears blue-shift compared with CN-B, which is related to the quantum confinement effect induced by the reduction in size and thickness [18]; the CN-T exhibits enhanced optical absorption in 450–800 nm, due to the multiple reflections of incoming light in the hollow tube [50]. Fig. S4 shows the absorption intensity of different composite catalysts in detail. Due to the occurrence electronic transition between the excited states g-C3N4 and MoC-30, the composite catalysts (Fig. 8 b) have strong and wide absorption covering almost the entire wavelength range (250–800 nm). The conversion between the absorbance intensity and band gap energy of the catalyst adhered to the Kubelka-Munk formula. Thus, the equation ahv = A (hv − E g ) n/2 is used to estimate the band gap energy (Eg) of the sample. It can be seen from Fig. 8 c that the Eg of CN-B, CN-T and CN-H are 2.7, 2.61 and 2.72 eV, respectively."
12,The PL and TRPL spectra,"3.7 The PL and TRPL spectra Fig. 9 a shows the photoluminescence emission (PL) spectra of the CN-B, CN-T, and CN-H at 380 nm excitation wavelength. The PL spectrum reflects the irradiative decay process of the semiconductor catalyst's electron transfer from the excited state to the ground state. Pure CN-H and CN-B showed a strong emission peak at 437 nm, indicating that the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is higher. After the photogenerated carriers are transferred to the surface of the catalyst, the proton adsorption capacity of g-C3N4 is weak, which makes the electrons unable to participate in the H+ reduction process [6]. The emission peak of CN-T is red-shifted from 437 nm to 463 nm, and the red-shift of the emission peak is related to the reduction of the sample band gap [30]. In addition, the decrease in PL intensity indicates that the directional mobility of carriers in the tubular g-C3N4 effectively separates the electron-hole pairs. Fig. 9 b shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the samples. The fitting decay lifetimes of samples are listed in Table 2, fluorescence lifetime indicates the time a particle exists in an excited state. The average lifetimes of CB-H, CN-B and CN-T are 0.62, 0.42 and 0.37, respectively. Obviously, the shorting of the average lifetime of the samples meant that electrons travel faster on the catalyst surface."
13,Electrochemical analysis,"3.8 Electrochemical analysis As can be seen from Fig. 10 a, the composite catalysts all exhibit good reproducible and reversible under periodic irradiation with visible light, indicating that the composite catalysts are able to provide a stable number of carriers [27]. The composite catalyst shows that the higher photocurrent densities are related to the increase in the light absorption intensity in Fig. 8, indicating that the composite catalyst can generate more photoexcited electrons and holes. The weakly tortuous photocurrent response curves of all pure samples can be detected only in the partial enlarged picture (Fig. 10 b), indicating that the photogenerated carriers produced by them are limited and the separation efficiency is poor. The photocurrent density of all samples decreases when the light source is obscured, because the photogenerated electrons are quickly transferred to the FTO substrate [51]. Nyquist plot is used to study the efficiency of electron transfer between the electrolyte solution (0.2 M NaSO4) and the catalysts on the working electrode. In Fig. 10 c, the existence of the excellent conductive carbon film makes MoC-30 have smaller arc size, and g-C3N4 has the highest impedance due to inherent defects. The semicircular arcs of the composite catalysts are much smaller than pure g-C3N4 and MoC-30, which proves that they have excellent electrical conductivity and low electron transfer resistance [52–54]. The photoelectrochemical activities for hydrogen activity of the catalysts coated on FTO substrate was investigated using LSV. In general, lower overpotentials are favorable for the hydrogen precipitation reaction [55,56]. The cathodic current densities of the composite catalysts are significantly lower than that of pure g-C3N4 and MoC-30. This is because the C film and MoC-QDs can reduce the onset potential and provide abundant active sites. Mott-Schottky plot is used to determine the flat band potential and characteristic type slope of the sample. As is shown in Fig. 10 f–i, the Efb of MoC-30 CN-B, CN-T, and CN-H at 500 Hz and 1000 Hz were recorded as − 0.95, − 1.21, − 1.48, and − 1.38 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively. After conversion, the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) of the catalysts is − 0.71, − 0.97, − 1.24, and − 1.14 V versus. The slope of the catalyst is consistent with the properties of the n-type semiconductor, with the ECB typically being − 0.1–0.2 V over Efb [54]. Therefore, the potential of conduction band (ECB) of MoC-30, CN-B, CN-T, and CN-H are calculated to be − 0.81, − 1.07, − 1.34, and − 1.24 eV (versus NHE). The CB position for samples is more negative than the H+/H2 potential 0 V versus NHE, indicating that prepared catalysts have the ability to reduce H2O and oxygen to H2 and superoxide radicals [57,58]. Integrating with the Eg of catalysts (Fig. 8 c), the VB of CN-B, CN-T, and CN-H are estimated to be 1.63, 1.27, and 1.48 eV. As shown in Fig. 11 a, the band gap energy of g-C3N4 is 1.21 eV, which is consistent with the previous article [59]. The result of DFT calculation is usually low, which is a normal situation [60]. This is caused by the weakness of the GGA function in the DFT calculation [61]. The band gap of MoC cannot be measured (Fig. 11 c), which is consistent with the results of UV–vis DRS analysis. The density of states (DOS) is used to evaluate the electronic properties of the catalyst. In the range of − 4 to 4 eV in Fig. 11 b, the orbit of the valence-band minimum (VBM) of g-C3N4 is mainly contributed by the N 2p state, and the conduction-band minimum (CBM) is mainly dominated of C 2p, and the contribution of N 2p is small. In particular, the VBM and CBM of MoC are mainly dominated by Mo 3d (Fig. 11 d). The charge density difference of g-C3N4 and MoC are shown in Fig. 11 e, f. The black, purple, and cyan spheres represent C, N, and Mo atoms, respectively. The red area represents electron accumulation, and the blue area represents electron consumption. The electrons are mainly distributed around the N atoms of g-C3N4 and the C atoms of MoC, and electron diffusion may occur after the two catalysts are combined. On the other hand, the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (DGH*) on the catalyst surface is an important indicator for evaluating the activity of the catalyst. Usually, the catalyst performance close to 0e V is the best [62]. Wang et al. [63] studied the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of hydrogen dissociation and adsorption on MoC, MoC/g-C3N4 at the corresponding sites. The calculation results proved that the introduction of g-C3N4 effectively enhanced the H* desorption/adsorption on the surface of the composite catalyst."
14,Proposed reaction mechanism,"3.9 Proposed reaction mechanism Based on the analysis and discussion of the above experimental results, Fig. 12 shows the possible reaction mechanism of the composite catalyst in the dye-sensitized system. First, the electrons on the VB of g-C3N4 are excited and transported to the CB under visible light irradiation, and the holes left in the VB are consumed by a sacrificial agent (TEOA) [64]. The well-conducting carbon film not only enhance the absorbance of the catalyst in the full wavelength range, but also serves as a two-dimensional matrix to provide a place for the anchoring of dye molecules MoC-QDs, and can capture the electrons provided by EY molecules and g-C3N4. The MoC has a large work function, which is the final flow direction of photoexcited electrons. The highly dispersed MoC-QDs are embedded in the carbon film and provide abundant active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In the dye-sensitized system, the LUMO orbital of the dye molecule is more negative than the CB potential of the catalyst, which can transfer a large number of electrons to the catalyst. EY molecules produce singlet excited state (EY1*) by absorb photon energy. The EY1* pass through inter-system crossing (ISC) to form triplet excited state (EY3*) with good stability [26]. The EY3* is reductively quenched to form free radicals (EY-•) under the action of TEOA [46]. At this time, a large number of electrons are transferred to the composite catalyst, and finally part of EY returns to the ground state."
15,Conclusion,"In summary, this article successfully prepared a composite catalyst coupled with g-C3N4 and MoC-30, and the nanostructures and properties of the catalysts were carefully investigated, highlighting the role of the inner cavity of CN-T and the slow photo effect of CN-H. In the whole reaction system, EY and g-C3N4 are the main electron donors; MoC-QDs grown on the carbon film enhances the light absorption capacity of the composite catalyst; highly dispersed MoC-QDs are the main active sites. In addition, the composite catalysts still have high stability after a continuous reaction for up to 45 h. This experiment is expected to provide some references for the in-depth study of g-C3N4 and the design of novel photocatalysts."
