0,Introduction,"The environmental problems and the need to improve air quality enforce the scientist to develop the efficient systems of clean energy production. Hydrogen is one of the cleanest fuels that can be exploited to generate energy (Llorca et al., 2013). H2 is mainly used in the chemical industry, but becomes more significant as fuel for power generation, especially for mobile applications. It is mostly extracted from natural gas, coal and liquid hydrocarbons. H2 can be produced from biomass gasification, from water by electrolysis, by steam reforming or partial oxidation from fossil fuels or all organic materials characterized by adequate hydrogen content. In recent years, the efforts to produce hydrogen from bio-ethanol by the steam reforming process have been intensified. Particularly, the possibility to use the as received bio-ethanol, without a previous distillation, in the fuel cell systems was evaluated, mainly due to the need for high working temperature. Successful implementation of practical technologies for H2 production from ethanol still requires many investigations, such as catalyst design and engineering, in-situ characterization, and study of the mechanism of the reaction. In the design of the catalysts, the attention should be focused on the development of active, H2 selective catalysts also resistant towards coke and carbonaceous compounds formation. In steam reforming, ethanol can be decomposed in the whole temperature range. The highest H2 production can be obtained when ethanol reacts with water to give CO2 and hydrogen Eq. (1), but this reaction requires high energy inputs and temperatures above 673 K. (1) CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3H 2 O → 2CO 2 + 6H 2 Δ H 0 29 8K = 173.3 kJ / mol The reaction pathways and thermodynamics depend on the catalysts which may favour dehydrogenation of alcohol to acetaldehyde or dehydration to ethylene. Both acetaldehyde and ethylene are important intermediates that might be formed even at low temperatures before the formation of hydrogen and carbon oxides occurred. While acetaldehyde plays an important role in the pathways leading to H2 formation, ethylene is a precursor of coke formation. However, acetaldehyde may decompose into methane and CO or condensate to produce acetone. Methane can be also formed at lower temperatures decreasing H2 production. Therefore, catalysts that would be active in H2 generation are sought. The economic reasons caused that steam reforming studies over noble metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) (Palmeri et al., 2007; Llorca et al., 2013; Martinsa et al., 2017) began to decrease at the expense of non-noble metal catalysts. It was found that supported Ni, Co or Mo catalysts are highly active in breaking the CC bond and producing of H2. However, high initial activity was suppressed by quick catalyst deactivation resulting from carbon deposition or particles sintering. To reduce the coke formation during the reaction, the alkali doped catalysts or basic metal oxides were proposed as a support (Freni et al., 2003; Frusteri et al., 2004a, 2004b; Szechenyi and Solymosi, 2007; Qiujie et al., 2009; Penkova et al., 2011; Bobadilla et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Wurzler et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). Our latest work (Zimowska et al., 2016a) on catalytic systems containing FexOy ultrafine nanoparticles on MoO3, obtained as a result of thermal decomposition of low porosity iron dodecamolybdophosphates FeHPMo12O40 and FePMo12O40 revealed that iron oxides can also enhance the hydrogen production in bio-ethanol steam reforming. Many attempts have been made to study the improvement of the yield of H2 production by tuning the catalyst texture, metal loadings, or particles size. Despite numerous papers presenting Fe-based catalysts, the nature of active sites is still a matter of discussion, as influence the reaction product distribution (Boudjemaaa et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017; Crouzet et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2019). Based on our experience in the tailored functionalization of clay derived supports and creation of the diverse iron-containing surface nanostructures (Zimowska et al., 2013, 2016b, 2016c, 2019), our idea was to merge into one system iron oxides and abundant clay minerals to obtain efficient, not expensive, eco-friendly, and highly porous catalysts also enriched into Mg species. In the present study, we propose the composite inorganic mesoporous materials combining a clay mineral, amorphous silica, and iron oxide, exhibiting catalytic properties for hydrogen production from ethanol. The use of clay minerals belonging to the major components of soil was dictated by their inherent features in composition, structure, and properties that allow for their engineering to obtain functional solids able to transform compounds into more desirable ones (Bergaya and Lagaly, 2013). In order to gauge catalytic properties related to the structure of the Fe species, triggered by the interaction with the support, the embedded catalysts, featuring Fe nanostructures on the surface of two highly porous supports: Porous Clay Heterostructures (PCH) and mesoporous silica (SBA-15 or MMS) were developed. Two different methods of iron deposition were applied, affecting different activity in steam reforming of ethanol. PCH composites were obtained by the incorporation of amorphous silica between the layers of clay mineral, Laponite. The composition of synthetic Laponite, resembling closely the natural clay mineral hectorite, consisting of one octahedral sheet (occupied by MgII) sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets (occupied by Si atoms) (Pálková et al., 2010a, 2010b; Gates et al., 2017) was the main reason for choosing this hydrous magnesium silicate for consideration in our studies. The properties of synthesized PCH composites were compared with the Fe doped mesoporous silica supports (SBA-15 and MMS) obtained by the surfactant directing structure method to provide the most efficient catalytic support. The functionalization of the supports by the development of the active surface Fe species, their nature related to the structural parameters of the supports, the pore size, acidity/basicity, type and size of particles as well as the role of clay mineral in H2 production, were investigated with the use of advanced adsorption and spectroscopic methods. According to the best of our knowledge, in this work for the first time, Laponite derived PCH composites functionalized by Fe species were applied for hydrogen production and confronted with mesoporous silica. Synergetic effect of highly porous catalytic systems based on abundant clay mineral supplying Mg species to suppress of coke formation and easy reducible Fe-O centres embedded into flexible amorphous silica base seemed to be the most promising system of selective ethanol decomposition. The potential to use the clay derived composites, featuring after functionalization nanocrystals of iron oxides and surface basicity due to Laponite component, beneficial in hydrogen production, was established."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Porous clay heterostructures (PCH) were synthesized according to Galarneau et al., 1995 and Zimowska et al., 2016b. Laponite RD®, synthetic layered hydrous magnesium silicate from Rockwood Additives (registered trademark of BYK Additives – named here as Lap) with empirical formula Si8Mg5.45Li0.4O20(OH)4Na0.4 and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 0.7 mmol/g was used to synthesize PCH support. In the first step, the interlayer sodium cations were exchanged for organic hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations (HDTMA). The amount of organic cations used for the exchange was two times the cation exchange capacity of Laponite. The aqueous solution of HDTMABr (CAS Number 57-09-0) was added to the aqueous suspension of Laponite and stirred for 16 h at ca. 60 °C. The excess alkylammonium salt was removed by repetitive washing with hot distilled water and centrifugation of supernatant until an AgNO3 test indicated the absence of halide anions. The resulting organoclay was air-dried. Subsequently, the neutral dodecylamine (DDA, CAS Number 124-22-1) as a co-surfactant and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source were added to 1 g of organoclay in the amounts corresponding to the organoclay/DDA/TEOS molar ratio of 1/10/75. After 4 h interaction at room temperature (RT) the solid component was recovered by filtration and air-dried. Annealing at 550 °C for 10 h in air flow resulted in the formation of PCH composite. Two types of typical mesoporous silica support (MMS and SBA-15), with a hexagonal arrangement of uniform pores but different size of the diameter of the pores were synthesized. Mesoporous silica known as Mesoporous Molecular Sieves (MMS), was prepared according to the procedure described by (Mokaya and Jones, 1996), by dissolving 5 g of dodecylamine in the mixture of distilled water and ethanol (2:3) under stirring. After the addition of 0.1 mol of TEOS, the mixture was stirred at room temperature (RT) for 20 h. The solid product was filtered off and calcined at 650 °C for 5 h to remove the surfactant. Ordered mesoporous silica, SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous type) was prepared according to the procedure described by Zhao et al., 1998. 4 g of non-ionic triblock copolymer Pluronic P123, Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (EO20PO70EO20, CAS Number 9003-11-6) was dissolved in 25 g of 35% HCl and 125 g of water under stirring. After 2 h 8.6 g of TEOS was added. The mixture was stirred for 20 h at 35 °C, and then the mixture was transferred to the HDPE bottle and heated for 24 h at 100 °C. The solid product was filtered off, washed with distilled water, and calcined for 6 h at 600 °C in order to remove the surfactant. Iron deposition was carried out by post-synthesis impregnation of siliceous PCH, MMS and SBA-15 supports. An appropriate amount of inorganic Fe-source (iron nitrate -Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) was employed to deposit of 8.5 wt% of Fe on each support (what corresponds to the molar ratio of Si/Fe equal to 10 in every sample. Additionally, the organic Fe-source (ferric citrate – C6H5FeO7) was used for PCH doping. The deposition method consisted of the successive soaking of 1 g of support with small (1.5 mL) portions of the aqueous solution containing of 0.07 M of Fe3+. During deposition, the sample was heated up to 80 °C to facilitate the evaporation of the solvent. Another portion of the solution was added dropwise to the dried sample. After impregnation, the as-synthesized samples were either directly calcined for 5 h at 550 °C (T method – thermal treatment) or, prior to calcination, autoclaved at 100 °C for 90 h (HT method – hydrothermal and thermal treatment)). As a result, eight functionalized samples were obtained, i) thermally treated: Fe-PCH/T, Fe-PCH-o/T, Fe-MMS/T, Fe-SBA-15/T, and ii) hydrothermally and thermally treated: Fe-PCH/HT, Fe-PCH-o/HT, Fe-MMS/HT and Fe-SBA-15/HT (Table 1 ) All chemicals were of reagent grade, manufactured by Sigma Aldrich and used as received."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods The morphology of the solids was carried out by JEOL JSM – 7500F Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) detection system of characteristic X-ray radiation INCA PentaFetx3 EDS system. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected with the X'Pert PRO (PANalytical B.V.) diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 30 mA by using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. All patterns were recorded in the 2 theta range from 2–72o with the use of silicon low background sample holder. The properties of Fe-modified samples were studied by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. A Mössbauer system equipped with the Janis top-loaded liquid helium cryostat (Janis Research Co., Wilmington, MA 01887 USA) and a conventional constant-acceleration spectrometer (Science Engineering & Education Co. USA) of the Kankeleit type in the transmission geometry was used. The γ-ray source (100 mCi 57Co(Rh)) and the absorbers were kept at RT during measurements. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for the determination of surface composition. The Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with the anode operating at 12 kV and 15 mA current emission was applied to generate core excitation. The hemispherical analyzer (SES R4000, Gammadata Scienta) was applied. The energy resolution of the spectrometer was 0.9 eV for the pass energy of 100 eV. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out in a quartz fixed-bed flow reactor connected online to the mass spectrometer (QMG 220 PRISMA PLUS). Signals of CO2 (m/z = 44) and Ar (m/z = 40) were recorded during the test. Prior to analysis, 100 mg of the sample was activated in He flow (40 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 2 h. Next, the reactor was cooled down to 30 °C, and pulses (250 μL) of 5% CO2/Ar were injected using a calibrated loop until saturation. Then, the sample was flashed in He flow. TPD was done from RT to 400 °C with ∆T = 10 °C min−1 under He flow (40 mL min−1). Catalysts were tested in the reaction of ethanol reforming in the temperature range of 250–550 °C and GHSV = 10,000 h−1, using a quartz gas flow-through microreactor. The concentration of ethanol in the flowing gas (N2) was ca. 15 g·m−3. Prior to the reaction, 0.3 cm3 of catalyst (0.25–0.50 mm fraction) was standardized in the flow of N2 at 200 °C for 2 h. More details are summarized in the Supplementary part (MS 1.)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology Scanning electron microscopy SEM images of the synthesized supports: clay derived PCH composite and mesoporous silica (MMS and SBA-15) clearly illustrated the differences in the morphology of the obtained materials resulted from the use of appropriate surfactant templates (Fig. 1 ). Soft templating caused the creation of very large particles of amorphous silica both SBA-15 and MMS type. The non-ionic surfactant mediated self-assembly of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) brought about the formation of aggregates of elongated, rod-like grains of mesostructured SBA-15 silica-based material (Fig. 1a). SEM image of the sample showed the presence of a well visible arrangement of the long and parallel pores which dimension may influence the transport limitations during the catalytic reaction. The exchange of the non-ionic surfactant into the combination of ionic HDTMA+ and neutral co-surfactant (DDA amine) led to the hydrolysis, condensation and polymerization of tetraethyl orthosilicate in the form of 1 μm spherical particles of MMS mesoporous silica (Fig. 1b). The use of Laponite as a nano scaffold completely changed the morphology of the synthesized PCH support. SEM micrograph depicted in Fig. 1c showed variously oriented platy particles of Lap, with their average thickness in the range of 10–14 nm, and plate width of 30–100 nm. They are much larger than primary particles of Laponite, with the disc-shaped crystallites of ca. 25–30 nm of a diameter and a thickness of approximately 1 nm, reported by Ramsay, 1986; Avery and Ramsay, 1986; Morvan et al., 1994; Hanley et al., 1997. However, the occurrence of tactoids with a higher dimension of Lap particles (average diameter of 40 nm and thickness of 2.5 nm) was revealed by Saunders et al., 1999 and indicated the adhering of consecutive, two to three face-to-face layers. Our studies showed a further level of Laponite particles organization, resulting from the face-to-face clustering of primary crystallites that can be easily adapted to the synthesis of PCH composites (Pálková et al., 2010a). The fusion of Laponite particles with silica precursor (TEOS) and a similar set of templates as in MMS material led to the formation of porous clay heterostructured composite support composed of amorphous silica nanotubes in the confined space of clay mineral interlayer. As a result, the morphology of PCH composite (Fig. 1d) presented the plates with dimensions of the average width in the range of 50–100 nm, similar to that of the used clay component and the average plate thickness 3–4 times higher than that of parent Lap particles. This observation implies that the molecular interactions leading to self-assembly of silica between the layers of Laponite ensure the creation of PCH composite grains with the dimension approximate to parent clay mineral, thus much smaller than mesoporous siliceous materials. This beneficial effect was attributed to the dimensions of clay mineral particles working as a hard nano-scaffold, which in the case of Lap is one of the smaller ones. Fig. 2A shows the XRD patterns of all catalysts modified by Fe doping. In the studied 2θ range (2–72o), the characteristic reflections of iron-containing phases were found mainly on PCH supports. Analysis of the PCH diffractograms indicated that nanocrystalline character of pristine Lap is maintained in PCH composite and two-dimensional structure of Laponite with (020), (110), (130), (200) and (060) reflections are preserved. The presence of an amorphous siliceous phase, which formed the walls of SBA-15 and MMS supports as well as the nanotubes between the layers of Laponite in PCH was reflected by the raised background in the range of 20–30° of 2θ. Calcination of the doped PCH resulted in the appearance of new reflections in the patterns, indicating crystallization of the Fe species of nanocrystalline character. The thorough analysis revealed that reflections characteristic of α-Fe2O3 were detected upon annealing of Fe-PCH/T sample, while Fe-PCH-o/T obtained after deposition of organic C6H5FeO7 salt exhibited the presence of low crystalline α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. The nanocrystalline structure of the surface Fe species was confirmed by HRTEM/TEM analysis of the calcined powders. TEM image of Fe-PCH/T sample with corresponding SAED (selected area electron diffraction) patterns (Fig. S1) indicated the presence of quite large (but not exceeding 80 nm) nanocrystals of α-Fe2O3 phase with rhombohedral R-3c symmetry. The analysis of TEM images and SAEP patterns of Fe-PCH-o/T sample confirmed the presence of two coexisting Fe oxide phases, well-ordered cubic nanocrystallites of Fe3O4 phase with the Fd-3 m symmetry and poorer exhibited nanocrystals of α-Fe2O3 phase. XRD analysis of Fe doped mesoporous silica revealed only traces of α-Fe2O3 on Fe-SBA-15/T support. Fe-MMS/T sample exhibited a lack of distinct reflections attributed to the Fe oxide phases indicating that iron was deposited in the form of well-dispersed species. The appearance of diffraction patterns has changed significantly after autoclaving. The hydrothermal treatment induced the formation of the more crystalline Fe oxides on the surface of Fe-SBA-15/HT or Fe-MMS/HT supports in comparison to thermally treated counterpart samples. The presence of two main reflections at 33.16° and 35.64° of 2θ on XRD of Fe-SBA-15/HT confirmed crystallization of α-Fe2O3 phase. Also, higher intensity reflections of the iron oxide phase were emerging from the background of Fe-MMS/HT. On the other hand, the use of hydrothermal assistance ensured better dispersion of FeOx nanostructures on the PCH surface. The intensities of the α-Fe2O3 phase diffractions diminished significantly in “HT” treated Fe-PCH/HT composite. Simultaneously, the XRD analysis of Fe-PCH-o/HT showed no evidence of α-Fe2O3 but only low-intensity reflection overlapping with the Lap component. To get insight into the nanocrystalline structure of the Fe species in the samples the XRD analysis was verified with the use of transmission electron microscopy investigation. TEM/SAED analysis confirmed that the HT process ensured the decrease of Fe-oxide dimension and revealed the crystallization of fine rhombohedral crystals of α-Fe2O3 on Fe-PCH/HT composite. HT treatment resulted also in better, more homogenous dispersion of the Fe species on Fe-PCH-o/HT composite. The analysis of the ring-like SAED pattern (Fig. S2) indicated that the intermittently visible, extra framework nanostructures under 5–8 nm were related to the Fe3O4 phase existence. N2 sorption isotherms and the main textural characteristics (Fig. 3 , Table 2 ) indicated that all synthesized materials possess highly extended specific surface areas. As a result of template removal from the PCH support, the extensive porosity with the surface area reaching the value 601 m2/g was developed. MMS silica exhibited a much larger specific surface area (SBET = 897 m2/g) and similar pore size distribution (PSD) confirmed by the most intensive peak centred c.a. 2.6 nm (Fig. 3B). As a result, the total pore volume of the MMS sample only slightly increased. The pore size distribution of SBA-15, derived from the NLDFT (nonlocal density functional theory) analysis (Neimark et al., 2000; Ravikovitch and Neimark, 2001; Thommes et al., 2006), indicated that pores in that material were more than twice larger (6.0 nm) in comparison to the counterpart samples. The enlargement of pore size in SBA-15 was not reflected by the development of the specific surface. As a consequence SBA-15 has S BET equal to 615 m2/g, similar to PCH composite. The textural variability appeared after transition metal deposition. Regardless of the applied supports, the introduction of iron resulted in the decrease of the S BET specific surface areas and the pore volumes. It is noteworthy that Fe doping lowered S BET roughly of about 20% reaching similar values for PCH and SBA-15 (~480 m2/g) and respectively higher for MMS (549 m2/g), although the 30% decrease in surface area was determined in this case. The detailed analysis of textural characteristics of Fe doped catalysts, synthesized by the “T” method, indicated that reduction of the specific surface area in all samples (Table 2) and observed downward shift of the N2 ads/des isotherms was caused mainly by the blocking of the template-generated channels in the supports. This statement was confirmed by the decrease of the peak intensities on the PSD profiles with simultaneous maintaining of the pore diameter maximum on all Fe-doped supports of the “T” – series. PSD data of Fe-PCH/T and Fe-PCH-o/T samples showed that the impregnation method followed by calcination caused the clogging of the supports pores mainly by the nanocrystals of iron oxide arising inside the channels. The slight shift of PSD profile towards lower pore sizes observed in Fe-SBA-15/T and the appearance of a small shoulder with the maximum about 2.3 nm on the PSD profile in Fe-MMS/T sample, suggested that some pores were covered by Fe-species lying along the walls of the siliceous channel. Iron incorporation with hydrothermal assistance resulted in a further downward shift of the isotherms with respect to the samples obtained by the “T” method (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the pore size distribution in HT treated Fe-SBA-15/HT and Fe-MMS/HT samples showed that the low peak intensities were similar to counterparts obtained by the “T” method, while the pore diameter maxima were similar to that of the parent samples. The disappearance of a shoulder on the PSD profile of Fe-MMS/HT and a slight shift of the pore diameter maximum towards values similar to parent SBA-15 support in Fe-SBA-15/HT indicated crystallization of larger FeOx clusters, which consequently caused the clogging of the pore system. HT treatment of Fe-PCH samples brought about a shift of the PSD maxima to the larger pore size region in comparison to the parent samples (from 2.6 nm up 4.5 nm) and increase of the average pore diameter (Table 2). The observed broadening of the pore system in the PCH supported samples was attributed to the pronounced embedding of Fe atoms into silica lattice of PCH composite, expanding the siliceous pore system of Fe-PCH/HT and Fe-PCH-o/HT samples, what was thoroughly described in our earlier work (Zimowska et al., 2016b). The above results indicated that the pressure treatment did not trigger so spectacular changes on siliceous supports as it took place in the case of PCH. This was not surprising since forced by the pressure migration of trivalent cations was additionally stressed by the clay layers resistivity on substitution. As a result, the FeIII was introduced into amorphous-crystalline PCH support subsidizing the siliceous network exclusively within the amorphous part. The substitution of SiIV by FeIII in SBA-15 and MMS lattice also occurred (what was confirmed by MS study) but in the case of PCH, this effect was much more pronounced. It is worth noting that the substitution in PCH was limited to an amorphous constituent, which gives a smaller contribution in whole material, while in silicate supports the substitution can occur in the entire volume of material. Therefore, the incorporation of heteroatoms into the structure of two-component PCH composite was site-selective, consequently increasing the density of the substitution in the siliceous network and formation of Si-O-Fe-O-Si linkages. As a result of the described mechanism of heteroatoms introducing, the silica network in PCH was pronouncedly expanded, which was confirmed by the increased dimension of the pore system."
6,57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS),"3.2 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS) 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of Fe doped porous silica samples were shown in Fig. 4 . The detailed numerical analysis of all spectra allowed to determine the hyperfine parameters of each component and their relative intensities (Table S1) revealing the coordination, local structure, symmetry, and state of Fe in the synthesized materials. All spectra were a superposition of at least two subspectra, which were symmetric quadrupole doublets seen in the central part of each spectrum (Fig. 4, light- and dark-grey components). The isomer shifts of these doublets were rather low (IS ≤ 0.23 mm/s), which was typical for FeIII species in tetrahedral surroundings (Burns, 1994; Fejes et al., 2000; Fejes et al., 2003; Mihályi et al., 2008). Fe species with lower quadrupole splitting (QS = 0.64–0.73 mm/s) can be referred to the high symmetry framework sites with low content of defects (bulk-type), whereas species with higher QS (1.06–1.30 mm/s) can be attributed to the FeIII ions occurring near to defect sites (surface-type). The values of the Mössbauer peak width of the resonance line (w) for both quadrupole doublets suggest well-defined framework structures of Fe-doped porous silica samples. Apart from the QS doublets in the central part of each spectrum, other components at high velocities with magnetic-like character can be found (Fig. 4, Table S1). The analysis of magnetic hyperfine parameters values revealed that identified components came from Fe2O3 mainly, in which FeIII ions adopt octahedral coordination. It indicated that crystallized α-Fe2O3 clusters were located in the extra-framework positions of the siliceous network. The characteristic magnetic sextets (40% of the total spectrum area) were quite well visible in Fe-PCH/T sample. Not so well distinguished magnetic components were also found in Fe-PCH/HT (28%), Fe-MMS/HT (53%), and Fe-SBA-15/HT (69%). In the last two samples, a very high contribution of extra-framework magnetic components in the total spectrum area was noted. Here, there was a strong reduction of resonance background baseline, especially in its central part, which was characteristic of the relaxation phenomena and can be related to the existence of ultrafine Fe2O3 particles and/or other iron oxide phases of superparamagnetic character (Zimowska et al., 2016a, 2016b). Such superparamagnetic oxide was well visible as a funnel-like component in the Fe-SBA-15/T spectrum (30%, black component). A weak relaxation component was also found in Fe-PCH-o/T (16%), whereas magnetic sextets do not exist anymore. Samples Fe-MMS/T and Fe-PCH-o/HT were almost totally free of magnetic components (thus, lack of Fe2O3), which indicated that all iron was distributed as subsurface species or was embedded into the framework structure. MS analysis showed that hydrothermal assistance leads to the substantial changes of the FeIII species distribution in the siliceous network. The most significant alterations were seen in MMS and SBA-15 matrixes, in which more than 50% of FeIII migrate from the intra-framework positions to the extra- ones after “HT”-procedure. Such extra-framework iron oxide particles had much larger dimensions, which caused the appearance of strong magnetic sextets in MS spectra. On the other hand, the weakening of magnetic components was the only visible change in Fe-PCH/HT after hydrothermal treatment, which was related to the loss of iron oxides crystallinity as well as the reduction of particle sizes. The minor changes were observed in the case of Fe-PCH-o/HT, in which HT-procedure caused the incorporation of almost all iron into the framework positions, thus ultrafine Fe2O3 particles were not observed in that sample. It is worth noting that hydrothermal treatment did not influence the oxidation state of iron species nor the FeIII (Td) distribution (bulk- and surface-like) in intra-framework positions of the siliceous network. Thus, such procedure can be used to controlled incorporation of FeIII into tetrahedral positions of various silica networks as well as to the rearrangement of some Fe species in extra-framework positions and even to their complete embedding into the bulk/sub-surface layers. The crucial role played here the appropriate choice of porous silica matrix. All these results were in line with XRD data and showed that due to strong support interaction, the nature and crystallinity of FeOx species were attributed to the matrix on which it was developed."
7,Redox properties of the catalysts,"3.3 Redox properties of the catalysts The results of H2-TPR temperature-programmed reduction with the hydrogen of iron-doped supports are presented in Fig. 2. All studied catalysts displayed hydrogen consumption in the range of 350–750 °C. Fe-PCH/T sample showed three peaks in the H2-TPR profile. The first uptake of hydrogen with a slight maximum at 440 °C was assigned to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. The presence of the second peak with a maximum at 544 °C indicated the reduction of bulky Fe3O4 to FeO. Much larger peak with a maximum at 637 °C revealed the formation of metallic iron. Hydrothermal assistance during Fe deposition changes the H2-TPR desorption profile of Fe-PCH/HT sample. The presence of two peaks and the shift of their maximum up to 452 and 637 °C indicated more difficult reducibility of Fe species. It was reported that the reduction of isolated FeIII species with tetrahedral coordination on porous siliceous supports required higher temperatures than that of FeOx cluster and decreased with the increase of the FeOx aggregation (Arena et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009; Macina et al., 2016). Therefore, taking into account the crystallographic parameters of the sample the presence of two broad maxima was related to the progressive reduction of highly dispersed FeIII entities which existence was confirmed by XRD and MS (Figs. 2 and 3, Table S1). A further shift of the reduction maxima related to the more difficult reducibility of the Fe species was observed for Fe-PCH-o/T and Fe-PCH-o/HT samples, where the maximum of the first hydrogen uptake appeared at 490 and 470 °C, respectively. H2-TPR profile of the Fe-PCH-o/T with the presence of the broad asymmetric peak ranging from 400–510 °C reflected the overlapping of H2 uptake processes, arising from different Fe species. Obtained after deconvolution, the maximum at 490 °C was attributed to the isolated FeIII species in tetrahedral coordination, embedded into the siliceous lattice. The shoulder at 422 °C was assigned to the reduction of Fe2O3 nanocrystals. The presence of a similar broad asymmetric peak ranging from 400–510 °C was observed for Fe-PCH/HT and Fe-PCH-o/HT samples. After a thorough analysis of the asymmetric peaks, one can find a relationship showing that the lower intensity of the shoulder and the lower of its temperature the fewer and smaller size crystallites of Fe2O3 were present on the surface of PCH catalysts. Therefore, with the diminution of Fe2O3 nanocrystals dimension, the maxima attributed to their reduction appeared at 440 °C (Fe-PCH/T), 431 °C (Fe-PCH/HT), 422 °C (Fe-PCH-o/T), 416 °C (Fe-PCH-o/HT), respectively and this was in line with XRD results. The shape of H2-TPR profiles without the pronounced presence of the third maximum suggested that complete reduction of the highly dispersed Fe entities was difficult, which was related to their embedding into the Si-O network. The shape of H2-TPR reduction profiles obtained for iron-doped MMS and SBA-15 supports exhibited different characters (Fig. 2). When both Fe-MMS/T and Fe-SBA-15/T featured only one reduction peak with a maximum at 424 °C, the H2-TPR profiles of Fe-MMS/HT and Fe-SBA-15/HT samples showed apart from the maximum at 415 °C, (Fe-MMS/HT) and 421 °C (Fe-SBA-15/HT), the appearance of the second peak with the maximum at 503 and 509 °C, respectively. Comparison of XRD, MS and H2-TPR results indicated that highly dispersed, isolated iron species, embedded into the siliceous lattice, developed on the extended surface of both mesoporous silica MMS and SBA-15 are reduced at higher temperatures (424 °C) while the low dimension nanocrystals of iron oxides underwent reduction at lower temperatures. Therefore, the hydrogen consumption at 415 °C (Fe-MMS/HT) and 421 °C (Fe-SBA-15/HT) was related to the reduction of FeIII in the aggregated small crystallites of oxide, while the reduction peaks occurring at 424 °C could be assigned to the reduction of sub-surface, isolated FeIII species developed on the surface of MMS and SBA-15 supports. These findings were in agreement with XRD measurements that support our conclusions giving valuable information about the crystallinity of Fe modified samples."
8,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies,"3.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies The surface composition of the iron-containing catalysts was characterized by XPS spectroscopy. The parameters of the quantitative analysis of XPS spectra in the binding energies (BE) regions of Si 2p, O 1 s, Fe 2p, and Mg 2p were collected in Table 3 . Upon impregnation of PCH composites, the relative content of Si at the surface of Fe-doped PCH significantly decreased. As is summarized in Table 3, the quantity of iron in Fe-PCH samples was about 3%. The slightly lower amount of Fe found in Fe-PCH-o/HT was the result of deeper embedding of Fe species into the siliceous network of PCH, which was studied in our recent work (Zimowska et al., 2016c). The lowering of the amount of Si-OH surface species corroborated the creation of Si-O-Fe linkages and the formation of sub-surface FeIII entities. The slightly opposite trend was found for magnesium contribution. XPS spectroscopy showed the enrichment of the PCH surface with MgII upon Fe doping. Our previous paper (Zimowska et al., 2016b, 2016c) indicated that acidic conditions during post-synthesis impregnation evoked partial decomposition of the Lap structure due to the dissolution of MgII from the octahedral sheet of clay mineral and migration of MgII towards outer layers of the composite. This effect was enhanced by hydrothermal assistance. The content of Mg entities influenced the basicity of the PCH surface. This is the reason why the basicity of the samples was evaluated later on."
9,The basicity of catalysts,"3.5 The basicity of catalysts The basicity of the catalysts is often assessed by the sorption of CO2 probe molecules (Liu et al., 2006; Keskitalo et al., 2007; Pavelec et al., 2017; Phongamwong et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2018; Schweke et al., 2018). Therefore, the surface basicity of synthesized catalysts was investigated by the CO2-TPD technique. At the beginning of the test, the catalysts adsorbed the first few pulses of CO2 and the full responses of the last subsequent ones indicated that maximum saturation of the surface has been achieved. The resulting temperature-programmed CO2 desorption profiles obtained for Fe-PCH samples are depicted in Fig. 5 . One desorption peak with a maximum at 72 °C was found in the CO2-TPD profile of the parent PCH. It indicated a very low concentration of the basic centres (2 μmol/g) and a very low basicity of the sample. The measured basicity of the PCH composite was attributed to the presence of Laponite - the crystalline component of clay derived sample - and its intrinsic structure. Laponite with its layered structure, consists of octahedral sheets sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets, occupied mainly by divalent MgII. In every third octahedron, due to the trioctahedral character of Lap, MgII coordinates with hydroxyl groups and can be accessed via hexagonal cavities in the tetrahedral layers (Ukrainczyk and Smith, 1996; Gates et al., 2017). It was their presence and availability that gave rise to the little sorption of CO2 molecules and contributed to the basicity of the PCH. Following the PCH functionalization, distinctive changes were observed in the TPD profiles. TPD of Fe-PCH composites showed several CO2 desorption peaks, indicating a variety of surface basic sites with different strengths. The strength of such sites increased as the peaks in the TPD profile appeared at higher temperatures. According to Liu et al., 2006 and Zhong et al., 2015 who studied the basicity of alkaline-earth oxides, the strength of the basic sites can be divided into three large groups in dependence of the temperature regions at which CO2 desorption occurs. Thus, the CO2 desorption occurring between 50–150 °C, 150–240 °C, and >240 °C indicates the ‘weak’, ‘medium’, and ‘strong’ basic sites, respectively. Generally, Fe-PCH samples exhibited a broad peak ranging from 40–300 °C with three maxima c.a. (70–89), (106–149) and (165–225o C) obtained after deconvolution, reflecting the overlapping of several CO2 desorption processes, arising from different basic sites. Analysis of the temperatures ranges at which CO2 desorption occurred revealed the presence of two weak and one medium basic centres in all series of Fe-PCH samples. The first weak basic sites (weak I) had the same origin as pure PCH. Development of another weak (weak II) and the new medium basic sites resulted directly from the doping of the composites (Fig. 5). The subsequent maxima corresponded to the similar ‘strength’ of the basic centres, but their different intensity revealed the different concentrations of these centres depending on the sample preparation method. The changes in the intensities of the second peak, expressing the concentration of the weak basic centres of type II, were in line with the amount of MgII species leached during impregnation of Fe-PCH structure (Table 3.). As the “weak I"" basic sites were related to the surface hydroxyl groups, it was found that dissolution of MgII from the octahedral sheet of Laponite and their migration towards the edges of the PCH layers brought about the creation of the new surface Mg-OH moieties, a stronger than coming from the intrinsic basicity. To get insight into the third maximum indicating the formation of the medium basic sites, the Fe-MMS, and Fe-SBA-15 samples were saturated with CO2 molecules. Analysis of CO2-TPD profiles revealed that regardless of the applied method of siliceous supports doping, all iron-containing SBA-15 and MMS samples exhibited a deficiency of basic centres. Adsorption of the CO2 pulses on Fe-SBA-15/HT and its response after saturation of the surface is presented in Fig. 5f,g, indicating only a negligibly small deviation from the baseline. Those findings pointed out that the presence of the third maximum on the CO2 profile was still related to the magnesium-enriched surfaces and ascribed to the Mg2+-O2− pairs evoking the medium basicity (Zhong et al., 2015). Analysis of CO2-TPD results revealed that the most basic character of the surface was shown by Fe-PCH-o/HT sample due to the highest number and the strength of basic sites. The above results showed that material engineering not only allowed to control the distribution and Fe speciation on the PCH surface but also to adjust the basicity of these surfaces which basic character can be arranged in the following series: F e - MMS ≈ Fe − SBA - 15 < PCH < Fe − PCH / HT < Fe − PCH − o / T ≤ Fe − PCH / T < Fe − PCH − o / HT"
10,Catalytic activity,"3.6 Catalytic activity The reactivity of Fe doped nanostructured clay-based PCH composites and Fe doped mesoporous silica was compared in the reaction of ethanol reforming. (Fig. 6 ). All catalysts successfully dissociated the CC bond of ethanol molecules, but it should be stressed that the type of support strongly influenced the distribution of the products of ethanol decomposition. Mesoporous silica (Fe-SBA-15 and Fe-MMS) prepared by “T” and “HT” methods exhibited roughly 10% higher conversion of ethanol than Fe-PCH samples. They revealed also pronounced dehydration of ethanol to ethylene (c.a. 50%) indicating acidic properties of these catalysts (Fig. 6). Simultaneously the yield to ethylene did not exceed 25% on Fe-PCH and above 500 °C it started to decrease. Pure PCH featured low activity due to the weak intrinsic acidity resulted from silanol groups presented on the surface (Zimowska et al., 2013). The most interesting aspect of catalytic tests was observed after exceeding 350 °C and related to hydrogen production. Fe-SBA-15 or Fe-MMS catalysts were not particularly selective to H2 formation, exhibiting from 10 to 35% of H2 yield. H2 was whereas the main product formed over Fe-PCH catalysts and Fe-PCH samples revealed the highest effectiveness of H2 production. Fe-PCH/T attained 60% of H2 yield at 550 °C. The analysis of the catalytic performance of all studied catalysts indicated that the development of nanocrystalline Fe oxides on the supports surfaces was beneficial for H2 production. The catalytic activity of Fe-siliceous supports enriched into iron oxides created by hydrothermal assistance was a premise confirming of this conclusion. Both Fe-MMS/HT and Fe-SBA-15/HT catalysts with a developed nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 on the surface exhibited higher selectivity to H2 than Fe-MMS/T and Fe-SBA-15/T samples with created sub-surfaces Fe species. Simultaneously, with the increase of the α-Fe2O3 phase contribution on Fe-PCH catalysts the highest yield to H2 was achieved. Another factor contributing to the increase of H2 production was the presence of Mg species triggered the favourable basicity of the catalysts' surface. Ipso facto, the sample with the highest number and the strength of basic centres (Fe-PCH-o/HT) was the second the most active catalyst among all tested, although its specific surface area was reduced almost twice (243 m2/g) in comparison to Fe-PCH/T (486 m2/g) exhibiting the largest H2 yield. It is worth noting that bare PCH without Fe species showed also traces of H2 (3%). To ascertain the function of the Mg species in bio-ethanol reforming, further analysis was carried out. First of all, basic centres did not increase the selectivity to acetaldehyde which resulted from the same and very low level of its yield (5%) on all catalysts. Acid centres promoted dehydration of ethanol to ethylene but were considered as a precursor of coke (Freni et al., 2003; Qiujie et al., 2009; Penkova et al., 2011; Bobadilla et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016;), according to the mechanism presented in Fig. S3. Dehydration of ethanol first proceeds by the protonation of the hydroxyl group, which leaves as a water molecule after cleavage of the CO bond. Then, the conjugate base deprotonates the methyl group, and the hydrocarbon rearranges into ethylene. Ethylene may rearrange into carbon deposits to form H2, followed by deactivation of the catalyst. The basic and the redox character of the catalysts contributed to dehydrogenation. The basic centres on Fe-PCH caused the depression of the overall acidity of catalysts. It was expressed by lower yield to ethylene. Consequently, the catalysts with the generated surface basicity should result in depression of coke formation during the reaction. Therefore the spent catalysts were characterized by XPS spectroscopy. XPS data analysis showed that the surface composition has changed significantly after the ethanol reforming. Two-threefold increase of carbon amount was observed on surfaces of all samples. The amounts of Si in the fresh and spent catalysts were almost the same. A significant decrease in iron contribution was found for spent samples (Table 3). PCHs with the embedded into sub-surface positions Fe species (Fe-PCH-o/T, Fe-PCH-o/HT) exhibited c.a. 35–48% reduction of Fe amount on the surfaces. Whereas, a much lower decrease of iron contents (c.a. 25%). were found on samples with developed Fe oxide (Fe-PCH/T, Fe PCH/HT). A more pronounced effect occurred on Fe-doped mesoporous silica. XPS analysis of Fe-SBA-15/HT and Fe-MMS/HT samples showed the 60–75% decrease of oxide derived Fe species and about 35–50% Fe content reduction on mesoporous silica catalysts with highly distributed Fe species (Fe-SBA-15/T and Fe-MMS/T). XPS investigations showed that iron species changed their oxidation state when interacting with ethanol upon the heating (Figs. S4 and S5). The binding energies of the Fe 2p peaks and their satellites in the fresh and spent catalysts were quite similar. However, the significant change in the relative areas of components was observed. All catalysts after the deconvolution of XPS Fe 2p spectra exhibited three doublets and their corresponding shakeup satellites. Fe 2p3/2 with BE in the range of 711.3 ± 0.2 eV were assigned to the presence of the FeIII species in the samples in the octahedral positions (in Fe3O4, and/or Fe2O3 oxides), whereas high-BE at 713.5 ± 0.2 eV confirmed the introduction of FeIII into the sub-surface lattice Si − O − Fe (tetrahedral) positions. The Fe 2p3/2 component with BE in the range of 709.8 ± 0.2 eV indicated the presence of the FeII species (in Fe3O4). After the catalytic test the contribution of FeIII species with BE at c.a. 711.3 eV decreased. Simultaneously, the content of the low BE component (below 710 eV) attributed to FeII species increased and their contribution was very similar on the surface of all catalysts. The most stable relative contribution revealed only FeIII introduced into the sub-surface lattice Si-O-Fe positions (Figs. S4 and S5). This indicated that the iron oxides present on the surface of the fresh catalysts were partially reduced by ethanol molecules, which was in line with our earlier studies (Zimowska et al., 2016a). Basing on the XPS results the mechanism of hydrogen production from ethanol can be proposed. In the first step, ethanol by dissociative adsorption to ethoxy species reduces iron oxide undergoing dehydrogenation to form adsorbed acetaldehyde. Simultaneously, the base participates in the removal of the proton and formation of the π-bond. Further decomposition of intermediates to CHx groups and CO2 and H adsorbed following by CC bond cleavage undergo. H2 is produced after desorption or, as a result of iron oxidation by water from the gas phase. The above data indicated that the use of hybrid, clay derived composites dual functionalized, enriched into Mg-OH species and reducible Fe oxides favoured dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and H2 generation with competitive dehydration to ethylene. Mg was a sufficient promoter to neutralize created acid sites. Such modification increased catalytic activity due to lower ethylene formation and reduced the formation of the carbon fraction during ethanol reforming. The presence of hydroxyls coordinated by MgII accessible owing to the Lap component in the support increased the rate of reaction in direction hindering carbon accumulation. To get insight into the stability of the generated heterogeneous surfaces in hydrogen production all catalysts were examined in terms of ethanol conversion vs. reaction time. The catalytic experiments were carried out by a gradual increase of temperature up to 550 °C and its maintaining for 3 h. The catalysts revealed the difference in H2 production (Fig. 6h). The trend of gradual deactivation was observed on Fe-mesoporous silica catalysts, whereas a more stable yield to H2 exhibited Fe-PCH catalysts. During a three-hour experiment, the yield to H2 oscillated around 40–43% (Fe-PCH-o/T), 48–49% (Fe-PCH/HT), 51–54% (Fe-PCH-o/HT) and 59–61% (Fe-PCH/HT), respectively. Simultaneously, a series of Fe-SBA-15 and Fe-MMS catalysts showed c.a. 6–10% drop of the activity. The above data were premise confirming that the support influenced the catalytic reaction, and the presence of clay mineral as a component of catalysts contributed to H2 production."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, two different methods of iron deposition into porous clay derived heterostructured PCH composite and mesoporous silica supports (SBA-15 and MMS) were compared. It was shown that wet soaking of the PCH with Fe3+ cations followed by thermal treatment, resulted in the growth of nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 whereas on MMS or SBA-15 supports caused sub-surface distribution of Fe species. The use of hydrothermal assistance ensured better dispersion of FeOx nanostructures on the surface of PCH supports, with even embedding of Fe into silica lattice, while induced the formation of more crystalline oxides on the surface of MMS or SBA-15 supports. All catalysts were active in steam reforming of bio-ethanol but a different distribution of reaction products was strongly dependent on the speciation of iron moieties developed on the supports surface and related to the acidic or basic surface properties of the used supports. The development of nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 on the surface of supports was beneficial for H2 production. Highly dispersed Fe centres on the surface of the siliceous SBA-15 and MMS promoted the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene which further polymerization resulted in the formation of carbon deposits. It is postulated that due to the creation of the basic sites on clay-derived PCH composite surface the reaction balance was shifted towards hydrogen formation, simultaneously limiting the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene. The generation of the weak basic sites was evoked by the migration of MgII to the composite surface from the octahedral sheet of Laponite building Fe-PCH structure. The presence of Mg markedly hindered the coke deposits formation facilitating the dehydrogenation pathway. The dehydration of ethanol to the ethylene was conducted on the acid centres particularly developed on the surface of mesoporous silica (Fe-SBA/T and Fe-MMS/T) where the formation of coke deposits was confirmed by XPS. The different distribution of reaction products indicated strong interaction of the support in the creation of active nanostructures during the synthesis of catalysts. Our studies have shown that amorphous silica, introduced between the layers of Lap, was a flexible base for anchoring active centers, which were available to reagents during the catalytic reaction. It was shown that clay derived PCH composites after functionalization with Fe species can serve as promising catalysts active in H2 production, more resistant to coke contaminants than Fe doped mesoporous silica.
