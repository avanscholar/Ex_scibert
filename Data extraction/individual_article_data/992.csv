0,Introduction,"Alcohol consumption is the seventh leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide, some 2.3 billion people are current alcohol drinkers. It directly causes nearly 3 million deaths indeed which not only becomes a global disease burden but also brings about substantial health loss (Griswold et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2018). Although researchers pointed out that the safest amount of alcohol consumption for health is zero (Griswold et al., 2018), drinking alcohol is still a very common social phenomenon. So far, alcohol consumption has been proved to be a risk factor for many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy and so on (Brunner et al., 2017; Csengeri et al., 2021; Griswold et al., 2018; Leong, 2019; World Health Organization, 2018). Related meta-analysis of prospective studies showed a direct linear relationship between alcohol and atrial fibrillation (AF) events, with an almost 8% increase in risk for each alcohol drink consumed per day (Conen, 2019). Especially, even low-dose, moderate, or habitual daily alcohol consumption can also increase the risk of AF (Csengeri et al., 2021). However, compared with the volume of alcohol intake, the frequency of alcohol consumption determines the increased risk of AF, and the patients who drank alcohol every day had the highest risk of AF (Kim et al., 2020). Therefore, the effect of frequent excessive alcohol consumption on AF is worthy of further study. The initiation, development and maintenance mechanisms of AF has been proved to be related to cardiac structural remodeling, electrical remodeling and autonomic nervous imbalance (Brunner et al., 2017; Christophersen et al., 2017; Guichard et al., 2020; Takemoto et al., 2017). Lipid peroxidation/ degradation, fibrosis and inflammation of myocardium are crucial components in these processes and ferroptosis also involves in these key pathological changes above (Martin-Sanchez et al., 2017; Protchenko et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). Ferroptosis is known as an iron- and lipotoxicity-dependent form of regulated cell death (RCD) which is triggered via iron-catalyzed process of lipid peroxidation initiated through non-enzymatic (Fenton reactions) and enzymatic mechanisms (lipoxygenases) under constitutive control by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4). (Dixon et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2019). It is characterized by increased iron ion level, intracellular glutathione consumption, decreased GPx4 activity, large amount of iron dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, excessive oxidative stress and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) dependent membrane lipid peroxidation. It is extremely important that the occurrence of ferroptosis depends on iron rather than other metallic elements. Therefore, if there is an imbalance of iron metabolism, especially iron overload disorders, it is likely to lead to the production of iron accumulation-induced ROS including hydroxyl radical (OH·). The generation of hydroxyl radical which relevance as one of the most harmful ROS depends on the reducing of hydrogen peroxide into a reactive radical by ferrous iron through Fenton reactions. In nature, the oxidizing ability of hydroxyl radical is second only to fluorine gas in solution. Moreover, hydroxyl radicals can also cause DNA damage in vivo and in vitro (Galaris et al., 2019; Imlay et al., 1988; Valko et al., 2005). Therefore, the pathological pathway of ferroptosis can be fundamentally blocked through stabling the imbalance of iron metabolism and oxidation/antioxidant systems. Accumulating evidences demonstrated that the key factors associated with ferroptosis have pro-survival functions which contribute to tissue maintenance, development and homeostasis (Galluzzi et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2016). Ferroptosis is associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including artery atherosclerosis, cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and so on (Fang et al., 2020, 2019; Gao et al., 2015; Lillo-Moya et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). However, it is unclear whether ferroptosis plays a regulatory role in AF induced by frequent excessive alcohol consumption. The purpose of this research was to explore whether ferroptosis involves in the susceptibility to frequent excessive alcohol consumption-induced AF and to propose a new therapeutic idea for the treatment of AF in this condition, as well as to provide guidance and warning for unhealthy alcohol-abuse lifestyle."

3,Animals and animal model,"2.2 Animals and animal model All animal experimental procedures in our study were carried out in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication, revised in 2011) and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Protocol No. 00,013,274). Adult male C57BL/6 mice (20–23 g, 6–8 weeks) were provided by the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei, China). The mice were conditioned in-house for 1 week after arrival with tap water and commercial diet available at will. Mice were housed in conditions under temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and a 12:12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water ad libitum. In addition, mice were weighed every day. 60 mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups and were fed for 21 days. Mice in the control group approached to 1 day (the first 20 days were administrated with sterile drinking water by gavage) or 21 consecutive days intervention at a single dose of 5 g/kg/d ethanol (Guillot et al., 2019) (53 % v/v edible ethanol was diluted to 30 % v/v) by gavage, resulting in a single or a consecutive excessive alcohol consumption intoxication. While mice in the experimental group experienced the same excessive alcohol drinking, but all received an intraperitoneal injection of Fer-1 (1 mg/kg) (Liu et al., 2020) 12 h earlier than drinking (abbreviated as: 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 group and 21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group). Similarly, mice in the control group all received an intraperitoneal injection of equal volume of normal saline (NS) (abbreviated as: 1d Alcohol group and 21d Alcohol group)."
4,Echocardiography,"2.3 Echocardiography Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography after the last treatment. Echocardiography was carried out using the VINNO 6VET ultrasound system (Vinno Technology, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China) which equipped with a 23-MHz linear array transducer (Vinno Technology, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China) after mice were placed in the supine position on an electrical heating pad under anesthesia (1.5 % isoflurane/100 % oxygen). The averaged echocardiographic parameters including heart rate (HR), left atrial diameter (LAD: anteroposterior, transverse and axial diameters respectively), left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) were collected from three to five cardiac cycles. The investigator was blinded to the treatment allocation when performing the measurements."
5,Ethanol concentration in serum,"2.4 Ethanol concentration in serum Serum sample extraction procedure and ethanol concentration determination. Mice were deeply anaesthetized by a lethal dose of intraperitoneal pentobarbital injection 3 h after the last ethanol gavage. Blood was collected by traumatic avulsion of retrobulbar vessels and kept for 10 mins at room temperature in tubes containing a serum gel with clotting activator (Aosaite, Shandong, China). Then blood samples were centrifuged at 3400 rpm for 30 mins at 4 °C. The samples were processed according to the operation instructions of the ethanol concentration assay kit next. Finally, samples were read at 570 nm and concentration of ethanol in the samples were calculated based on the standard curve which was established according to the instructions of assay kit. The results of which were displayed in millimole of ethanol per litre of serum."
6,Non-heme iron in serum,"2.5 Non-heme iron in serum Blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 3400 rpm (4 °C) for 30 mins to obtain serum in the same way above. The samples were processed according to the operation instructions of the serum iron concentration assay kit next. Samples were read at 520 nm and the non-heme iron content of unknowns were calculated by establishing a standard curve according to the manufacturer’s instructions, the results of which were displayed in micromole of iron per litre of serum."
7,Histopathology analysis,"2.6 Histopathology analysis After the murine hearts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, they were embedded in paraffin and made into 5-μm sections. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E): cardiac paraffin sections were dewaxed in xylene for 5−10 mins, and then dehydrated with anhydrous ethanol, 95 % ethanol, 85 % ethanol and 75 % ethanol for 5 mins each. After staining by hematoxylin solution (Harris) for 3−5 mins, the tissues were washing by 1% dilute lithium carbonate water solution back to blue. And then dyed the tissues in eosin (alcohol soluble) for 1–2 seconds without washing. Finally, the tissues were added into 95 % ethanol directly and dehydrated in absolute ethanol for 1−2 mins. Prussian blue staining: cardiac sections were deparaffinized at 60 °C for 1 h and hydrated in distilled water. Equal volumes of potassium ferrocyanide solution and hydrochloric acid solution were mixed to make a working iron stain solution. The cardiac tissues were then incubated by the working solution for 10−20 mins. The nucleus was restained with nuclear fast red solution for 5−10 mins. DHE-ROS reactive oxygen detection: after the frozen murine hearts were cut into 5-μm sections, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 mins. Each of tissue sections were added about 50 μl of DHE working solution (1:500 dilution), and placed in a moisturizing box to protect from light for one hour at room temperature. Finally, slow fade gold antifade reagent with DPAI were added to seal the sections. H&E staining and prussian blue staining were examined under a light microscope (CX31, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and accumulation of iron was visualized. All fluorescence images of DHE-ROS reactive oxygen detection were captured with a fluorescence microscope (BX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) in dark area."
8,Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR),"2.7 Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total proteins were extracted from the frozen atrial tissues. Protein concentrations were determined and normalized using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (G2026, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Following that, proteins (50 mg) were separated by sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Finally, secondary antibodies were incubated with the membranes for 60 mins at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence (BL523B, Biosharp, Anhui, China) was used to visualize the signals. Total RNA was purified from the atrial samples using RNAiso Plus reagent (9109, Takara, Japan). RNA was transcribed into complementary DNA with the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (#RR047A, TaKaRa). Then, qRT-PCR was conducted in a 20-μl reaction system containing cDNA, forward primers, reverse primers, and SYBR Premix Ex Taq (#RR420A, TaKaRa). The sequences of the primers used for qRT-PCR in this experiment are described in the supplementary materials. The protein and gene expression levels of target genes were normalized to the internal reference gene GAPDH."
9,Cell culture and treatment,"2.8 Cell culture and treatment H9c2 cell line was provided by the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12, Hyclone, SH30023.01, USA) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10099, GIBCO, Australia) and 1% penicillin streptomycin solution (Hyclone, SV30010, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Then, H9c2 cells were seeded onto 96-well cell culture plate in the culture medium mentioned above for 48 h. After that, cells were treated separately by 2 μM ethanol with or without the addition of Fer-1(1 μM) for 12 h or 24 h, some of the other cells were stimulated by 1 μM Erastin for 8 h. The effects of corresponding stimulus response on cell viability were detected by CCK8. In this study, samples in an experiment represented one independent replicate, and every experiment needed to be repeated at least 3 times."
10,Electrocardiograph analysis,"2.9 Electrocardiograph analysis Mice were anaesthetized using inhaled isoflurane (1.5 % isoflurane/100 % oxygen). Then, the 2 subcutaneous leads were positioned approximately on electrocardiograph (ECG) limb leadⅡ. Data were analyzed off-line using LabChart 7 Pro (AD Instruments, Sydney, Australia). ECG waveforms averaged over 4 consecutive beats were used for analyses."
11,Electrophysiological studies of isolated perfused hearts,"2.10 Electrophysiological studies of isolated perfused hearts All in vitro langendorff-perfused hearts were prepared according to previously published methods (Shuai et al., 2019). Detailed electrical stimulation and measurement methods are provided in the supplementary materials."
12,Statistical analysis,"2.11 Statistical analysis Results in our study were displayed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and analyzed by GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Comparisons among multiple groups were analyzed via one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test while comparisons between 2 groups were evaluated via Student's t-test or 2-way analysis of variance. Categorical data are expressed as percentages and were analyzed using Fisher exact test. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance."
13,Results,
14,The general status of drunken mice,"3.1 The general status of drunken mice In our research, we observed that mice treated with a single dose of excessive alcohol consumption showed obvious symptoms of neurological inhibition, such as walking instability, transitory lethargy, loss of righting reflex and so on. Generally, they could wake up completely within 3−5 h and return to normal state. In addition to the symptoms above, the mice treated with frequent excessive alcohol consumption also showed drowsiness and the decreasing of mobility, responsiveness and forage, which could be partially alleviated by injection of Fer-1. Due to the prolonged sleep time, decreased appetite and declined food intake caused by intoxicated drunkenness, compared with the 1d Alcohol group, the body weight of 21d Alcohol group’s mice did not increase significantly and remained slightly below their initial body weight baseline level (P＜0.01), and the drop of body weight could not be reversed even after the injection of Fer-1 (Fig. 1 A). Although there were differences in intoxicated drunkenness performance and treatment among groups, no statistical difference was found in serum ethanol concentration (Fig. 1B) and the overall average ethanol concentration was approximately 151.16 ± 16.38 mM."
15,Frequent excessive alcohol consumption was associated with the imbalance of iron metabolism and the increase of ferroptosis,"3.2 Frequent excessive alcohol consumption was associated with the imbalance of iron metabolism and the increase of ferroptosis In general, the concentration of non-heme ion in the serum of mice which exposed to frequent excessive alcohol for 21 days increased significantly and it was much higher than that exposed to excessive alcohol only once (P＜0.01), meanwhile the concentration of non-heme iron in the serum of mice in the combined use of Fer-1 treatment group decreased significantly compared with the group without Fer-1(Fig. 2 A). Moreover, prussian blue staining of atrial tissues showed that accumulation of iron in 21d Alcohol group was higher than that in 1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 group (P＜0.01), and it was decreased after treatment with Fer-1 (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the ferroptosis might be activated in this frequent excessive alcohol consumption condition. Besides, we found that the ferroptosis-related protein and mRNA levels of GPx4, FTL and FTH1 were significantly downregulated, while the corresponding indicators level of PTGS2 were significantly upregulated in atrial tissues of 21d Alcohol group compared with other groups (P＜0.05), and some of these changes can be antagonized by using Fer-1 in 21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group (Fig. 2B-D). Through the research on the level of oxidative stress reactions in atrial tissue, we found that the level of ROS in the 21d Alcohol group was significantly increased compared with other groups, while the fluorescence intensity of ROS was significantly decreased after Fer-1 treatment (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group), which was basically close to that in the 1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 group. In different stimulation experiments in H9c2 cells, it was found that alcohol stimulation could reduce the cell viability rate significantly, and with the stimulation time extended from 12 h to 24 h, the cell viability rate decreased even more. But compared with the positive control group (the stimulant was Erastin), the decrease was not sharp. Besides, we also observed that the addition of Fer-1 in the alcohol stimulation group increased the cell viability rate of H9c2 cells significantly (P＜0.05) (Fig. 2G). All of these evidences suggested that iron metabolism was abnormal and ferroptosis was activated in atrial tissue of mice with frequent excessive alcohol consumption, but the variation of related parameters could be improved by Fer-1."
16,Inhibition of ferroptosis had little effect on cardiac structure and function under frequent excessive alcohol consumption,"3.3 Inhibition of ferroptosis had little effect on cardiac structure and function under frequent excessive alcohol consumption The heart weight and heart weight to tibia length (HW/TL) ratio were significantly decreased in 21d Alcohol group compared with the 1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 group (P＜0.05), and these changes could be antagonized by the use of Fer-1 in 21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group (Fig. 3 A and B). In H&E staining, we observed that the intercellular structure of atrial tissues was loose in the frequent excessive alcohol consumption group mice compare with the other groups, but no obvious changes of cardiomyocyte steatosis, interstitial fibrosis, or inflammatory cell infiltration were observed (Fig. 3C). None of the histological and structural changes of the heart above had any effect on the left atrium diameter and left ventricular function in echocardiography (Table 1 ). However, since the course of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a chronic accumulation process, cardiac function in this 21-day periods is probably just in the early stage of compensation."
17,Inhibition of ferroptosis reduces frequent excessive alcohol consumption-induced atrial electrical remodeling,"3.4 Inhibition of ferroptosis reduces frequent excessive alcohol consumption-induced atrial electrical remodeling Although the left ventricular function was relative normal and the changes of left atrial diameters were in the compensatory stage among groups, the electrophysiological characteristics had undergone visible changes. Surface ECG (leadⅡ) recordings were performed on mice under inhaled anesthesia (Fig. 4 A). There was no significant change in the duration of P wave and QRS wave among groups (Fig. 4B and C); the T wave was inverted to different degrees only in 21d Alcohol and 21d Alcohol + Fer-1 groups, but not in 1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 groups (Fig. 4A). Compared with single excessive alcohol consumption group (1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 groups), RR interval of mice in 21d Alcohol group was shortened (P＜0.01), and injection of Fer-1 (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) could restore RR interval to a state similar to that of 1d Alcohol group (Fig. 4D); PR interval of mice in 21d Alcohol group was shortened, and injection of Fer-1 (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) could only partially but not fully reverse the changes (Fig. 4E); interestingly, the QTc interval of mice in 21d Alcohol group was prolonged (P＜0.01), and the injection of Fer-1 (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) could obviously antagonize the prolongation of related electrophysiological changes (Fig. 4F). Meanwhile, through determination the expression levels of protein and mRNA of ion channel (Kv1.5, Kv2.1, Kv4.3 and Cav1.2) and calmodulin (CaM) including PLB, p-PLB and Serca2α in the atrial tissues, we found that Kv1.5, Kv2.1, Kv4.3, Cav1.2, p-PLB and Serca2α were all significantly down regulated in 21d Alcohol group compared with 1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 groups (P＜0.05), but their protein and mRNA expression levels all increased significantly after Fer-1 treatment (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) (P＜0.05). And there was no significant difference in protein and mRNA expression levels of PLB among groups (Fig. 4G-I)."
18,Inhibition of ferroptosis reduces the susceptibility to frequent excessive alcohol consumption-induced AF,"3.5 Inhibition of ferroptosis reduces the susceptibility to frequent excessive alcohol consumption-induced AF Langendorff-perfused hearts were used to characterize changes in electrophysiological parameters: 90 % action potential duration (APD90), effective refractory periods (ERPs), inducibility rate of AF and duration of AF (Fig. 5 ). The APD90 and ERPs in frequent excessive alcohol consumption group (21d Alcohol group) were significantly shorter than those in the single excessive alcohol consumption groups (1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) (P＜0.05), and the shorten of these electrophysiological parameters could be partially prolonged by injection of Fer-1 (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) (Fig. 5A and B). Most importantly, the inducibility rate of AF and duration of AF in 21d Alcohol group were significantly higher than those in 1d Alcohol and 1d Alcohol + Fer-1 group which the inducibility rate was as high as 80 %, and the average duration was 48.75 ± 8.85 s. Both of the inducibility rate and duration of AF were significantly declined after injection of Fer-1 (21d Alcohol + Fer-1 group) (Fig. 5C-E)."
19,Discussion,"Frequent excessive alcohol consumption is undoubtedly harmful to health. It has obvious toxic side effects on liver, kidney, cerebrovascular system and cardiovascular system. Previous studies on excessive alcohol consumption mainly focused on the liver, it is recognized that alcohol has hepatotoxicity and long-term intake of alcohol can increase the burden on the liver which will cause the damage and degeneration of hepatocytes, as well as necrosis and proliferation of fibrous tissue, thus eventually lead to alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, function decline or atrophy (Singal and Mathurin, 2021). More importantly, liver is the main iron storage site of the body and plays a central and pivotal role in the regulation of iron homeostasis (Galaris et al., 2019). Iron is involved in most of biochemical systems such as the electron transfer reaction during mitochondrial respiration, synthesis and repair of DNA, hemoglobin oxygen transport, induction and generation of free radicals and many other important reactions. Thus, both the iron deficiency and excess will have adverse effects on the body. Iron deficiency can cause anemia, decreased immunity, abnormal metabolism, etc., while the iron overload will also cause pathological ion deposition in some organs, such as hemochromatosis or increased iron deposition in liver parenchyma, accelerating the process of hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress response, inflammatory reaction and hepatic fibrosis (Brissot et al., 2018; Fernandez-Real and Manco, 2014). The maintenance of iron homeostasis depends on the synergistic effect of ferritin (consisting of FTH and FTL, excess of intracellular iron is stored in ferritin), transferrin, hepcidin and iron related proteins. Current studies have confirmed that alcohol consumption can lead to the up regulation of transferrin receptor expression and increase iron uptake in the liver. At the same time, alcohol consumption can also decrease the expression of hepcidin, resulting in increased intestinal iron absorbing and iron storage in the liver, which can eventually lead to iron homeostasis disorders (Brissot et al., 2018; Harrison-Findik et al., 2007). Moreover, alcohol induced ferroptosis also play a role in hepatocyte autophagy through p62−Keap1−Nrf2 pathway (Zhao et al., 2021).The notion of alcohol consumption can induce iron homeostasis imbalance and ferroptosis is supported by studies above. Considering the scientific fact that both long-term and short-term alcohol consumption are related to the initiation and development of AF, it is necessary to explore the effect of inhibition of ferroptosis on alcohol consumption induced-arrhythmia, which may provide a new idea for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Until now, we have known that GPx4 is a member of the selenium-containing GPx family and plays a decisive role in the regulation of membrane lipid peroxidation. Through catalyzing the reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxide (PL−OOH) on membrane lipid to corresponding alcohol, it can prevent the interaction of PL−OOH and labile iron, thus avoiding the production of highly reactive radicals. Therefore, inhibition or depletion the activity of GPx4 will no doubt lead to the imbalance of ROS generation and scavenge, this is why GPx4 is known as the key regulator of ferroptosis (Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014; Maiorino et al., 2018). PTGS2 has been identified as a specific downstream marker of ferroptosis, and its’ upregulation represent the lipid peroxidation that occurs during GPx4-mediated ferroptosis (Tang and Kroemer, 2020; Yang et al., 2014). And in the elaboration of iron homeostasis above, we have mentioned that ferritin is a spherical cavity heteropolymer composed of two subunits of FTH and FTL. It allows the storage of iron at high concentrations or even in excess, so as to prevent the iron from accessing to substrates that generate ROS and thus ultimately constitutes an important component of the antioxidant system (Fang et al., 2020). Fer-1 is an effective ferroptosis inhibitor, which is considered to be an ROS scavenger. However, based on its chemical structure, it may also work by removing unstable iron from cell membranes as an iron chelator and by inhibiting the interaction between iron and peroxide, so as to prevent the formation of destructive free radicals (Louise Cragg et al., 1998; Skouta et al., 2014). In our study, we found that there was no significant difference in the concentration of ethanol accumulation in the serum of single and frequent excessive alcohol consumption mice, and whether ferroptosis inhibitor (Fer-1) was used or not, there was no effect on the concentration distribution of ethanol in the serum. But the concentration of serum non-heme iron was significantly increased in the frequent excessive alcohol consumption mice, as well as the protein and mRNA expression levels of GPx4, FTL and FTH1 were downregulated, while PTGS2 was upregulated in atrial tissues, and these changes could be reversed by using Fer-1. These clues suggested that the pathological processes of iron overload disorders and ferroptosis were activated in mice with frequent excessive alcohol consumption. Furthermore, we also observed that frequent excessive alcohol consumption can significantly interfere with the normal physiological metabolism in the body. The weight of corresponding whole body, heart and HW/TL showed no noticeable increase with the prolongation of drinking time. These signs may be related to the disturbance of lipid metabolism and the reduced food intake caused by alcohol intoxication. In histopathology, we could also find that the myocardial tissue of mice in the frequent excessive alcohol consumption group became relatively loose. In this study, the results of echocardiography showed that the changes of atrial structure and left ventricular function were not significant under the condition of short-term frequent excessive alcohol consumption. However, it was known that the exposure of long-term accumulative alcohol damage, especially in the state of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, the whole cardiac cavity often expands, myocardium develops hypertrophy and fibrosis, the cardiac systolic function declines, and a series of arrhythmias may occur (Artico et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2018; Ware et al., 2018). These results may suggest that the effect of frequent excessive alcohol consumption on cardiac structural remodeling and cardiac function in the short term (21 days) was not significant, while ferroptosis did not lead to a tangible result in structural remodeling. So, the cumulative effect of ferroptosis on long-term alcohol consumption is worthy of further study. Some previous studies have described the electrophysiological correlation between alcohol consumption and AF. Alcohol consumption caused AF through affecting potassium channels’ proteins (Kv1.5, Kv7.1, Kir2.3 etc.) expression and influencing potassium current (Sutanto et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Our results of this study are similar to those of previous studies. However, the feature of this study is that it proved that the abnormality of electrophysiological parameters will be aggravated under the condition of frequent excessive alcohol consumption, especially the inducibility rate of AF and AF duration time were significantly increased, as well as the proteins and mRNA expression levels of ion channel and CaM were abnormal. These results are consistent with the microstructure changes of ferroptosis. When ferroptosis occurs, the cell membrane is usually intact and the nucleus size is normal, but mitochondria are often characterized by electron-dense ultrastructure impairment such as reduction of volume, increase of membrane density, crumple of cristae-structured mitochondrial inner membrane, rupture of mitochondrial outer membrane and so on. Mitochondria supply energy to protein pumps, which are responsible for various ion flows in cell. The dysfunction of mitochondria due to ferroptosis will undoubtedly lead to changes in electron flow and electrical potential inside and outside the cell which eventually leading to a series of arrhythmias (Galaris et al., 2019). Due to the destruction and dysfunction of the mitochondrial membrane, excessive calcium ions (Ca2+) flow into the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial calcium overload (Wang et al., 2020). Studies have shown that specific inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by ruthenium red balanced calcium overload and maintained the integrity of mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2019). As the main intracellular Ca2+ influx pathway, L-type calcium channel (Cav1.2) causes changes in transmembrane potential by controlling the entry of Ca2+ into cells, and plays an important role in the generation of cardiomyocyte action potential, excitation contraction coupling, transcription of functional dependent gene and the release of hormones or neurotransmitters. According to our results, the protein and mRNA expression levels of Cav1.2 were down-regulated during frequent excessive alcohol consumption, so in this case, the increasing of intracellular Ca2+ concentration may be caused by the release of calcium pools in the endoplasmic reticulum or sarcoplasmic reticulum, rather than the transport of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell through protein pumps. Because in the case of mitochondrial impairment and dysfunction, a large number of ion transport may not be realized due to insufficient energy. After the intervention of Fer-1, the abnormality degree of arrhythmia parameters was improved to a certain extent. These evidences suggested that ferroptosis is an important pathological process involved in the initiation and maintenance of AF induced by frequent excessive alcohol consumption. Ferroptosis was activated due to frequent excessive alcohol consumption induced iron overload disorders, in this circumstance, a large number of iron-dependent ROS were produced. Both the oxidation/antioxidant systems disorder and iron homeostasis imbalance were equalized with the application of Fer-1, and then the generation of ROS reduced. Eventually, the susceptibility to AF was declined through reducing the ROS damage to cardiomyocytes. However, the mechanism of how iron and ferroptosis play a role in ion channel changes on arrhythmia remains to be further studied. In addition to the changes of potassium channels, calcium channel and CaM reported in this study, previous studies have also shown that alcohol consumption can induce atrioventricular reentrant arrhythmia in a dose-dependent manner. And the severity of myocardial reentry induced by alcohol depends on the coupling alterations between myocardial cells and the degree of myocardial fibrosis (Sutanto et al., 2020), but whether ferroptosis plays a role in this process remains to be further explored. In this study, we focused on the effects of spirits on arrhythmias, but recently there have been many different studies on the types of alcohol. Some studies suggested that wine, unlike other kinds of alcohol, has little effect on cardiovascular structure remodeling and functional changes (Rodrigues et al., 2018), which deserves further discussion. Generally speaking, ferroptosis is involved in the initiation, development and maintenance of AF induced by frequent excessive alcohol consumption. In this case, the susceptibility of AF is mainly related to the duration of alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, this finding is cautionary for people with alcohol abuse or people who drink excessively for social reasons on a long-term basis. Because AF is not only an independent arrhythmia disease, but also can lead to heart failure, thromboembolism, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular stroke and many other diseases, hence the use of ferroptosis inhibitor before or during the period of alcohol consumption may play a role of prevention and treatment in alcohol-related AF. However, as a synthetic antioxidant, Fer-1 successfully inhibits ferroptosis and reduces cell impairment caused by ROS, so that reduces cell death. But considering the practical clinical development and utilization of this drug, whether it will affect the balance between cell proliferation and death, and whether it will lead to other problems caused by cell longevity or even accumulation needs further exploration."
20,Limitations and strengths,"In this research, we studied the arrhythmic parameters such as the inducibility rate of AF in the isolated hearts of mice, which may be deviated from the real situation in vivo due to the lack of corresponding influence of the autonomic nervous system. However, the relevant research results are consistent with the trend of clinical phenomena observed in macro clinical practice anyhow."
21,Conclusions,"Frequent excessive alcohol consumption is associated with an increased susceptibility to AF compared with single excessive alcohol consumption. Besides, ferroptosis is involved in the initiation of AF induced by excessive alcohol consumption and through the inhibition of ferroptosis can reduce the susceptibility to AF in this condition."
