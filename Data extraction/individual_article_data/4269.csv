0,Introduction,"Oxazolidines are a class of heterocyclic compounds consisting of a five-membered ring containing one nitrogen, one oxygen and three carbon atoms [1]. Similar to well known oxazoles [2] and oxazolines [3], the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in oxazolidines are in the 1 and 3 positions, respectively, and there is always a carbon atom between them. In contrast, all of the carbon atoms in oxazolidines are reduced and the five-membered ring is fully saturated. Therefore, they have completely different steric structures and electronic properties. Unlike oxazolines, which have been extensively used as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis and supramolecular chemistry [4], the oxazolidines are less studied. Anyway, in recent years oxazolidines have also attracted considerable attention in chemical science and recently they have been used as chiral ligand in some catalytic reactions like in aza-Michael reaction [5], organozinc reactions [6], Friedel–Crafts reaction [7], or in palladium-catalyzed Diels–Alder [8] and allylation [9] reactions. Some of the oxazolidine derivatives are used as anticonvulsants and have application as performance modifiers in polyurethane coatings and paints [10]. Due to this, it is expected that the development of new oxazolidines and their coordination compounds can lead to new systems for several fields in medicinal, chemical and material sciences. Therefore, introducing efficient synthetic methods for selective synthesis and isolation of oxazolidines remains an interesting open research field in synthetic and heterocyclic chemistry. Although oxazolidines can show interesting properties, searching literature including Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [11] indicates that only a few number of oxazolidine compounds have been structurally reported until now. Surprisingly, most of them have been prepared by in situ metal template techniques from the reaction of aldehydes/ketones, 1,2-amino-alcohols (H2NCR2 CR2OH, RH or C) and metal salts like Fe [12], Zn [13], Pd [14], Nb, Gd, Sm [15], Cu [16] and Ni [17]. In these reports the ligand has not been isolated or characterized and in most of them it is suggested that the metal ion has catalytic effect on the formation of oxazolidine ring. Li and co-workers [18] have suggested that maybe beside the metal ion some other materials in the reaction mixture (like thiocyanate) have also effect on the formation of oxazolidine ring. Nevertheless, recently some oxazolidine compounds are produced by various methods in the presence or in the absence of metal ions [19]. Therefore, there is a lack of information about efficient synthetic methods for selective production of 1,3-oxazolidines and also their structural and physical properties. According to the previous reports it is obvious that the reaction of aldehydes/ketones with 1,2-amino alcohols is the simplest method for production of 1,3-oxazolidines. Although a Schiff base is the usual product of the reaction between primary amines and aldehydes/ketones [20], 1,3-oxazolidines can also be obtained if the alcoholic functionality of 1,2-amino alcohol involve in the water elimination reaction from hemiaminal intermediate (see Scheme 1 a). Recent reports on the crystal structure of hemiaminal compounds [21] confirm that the hemiaminal intermediates can be stabilized by controlling electronic parameters. So, it is predictable that the elimination of water molecule from this intermediate can be a controllable reaction, too. It is obvious that the elimination of water molecule by hydrogen atom of alcoholic group (OH) has higher energy barrier than hydrogen atom of NH moiety. Undoubtedly the metal ions have catalytic effect in obtaining a 1,3-oxazolidine instead of a Schiff base, but it is obvious that the other parameters like electronic character of the substituents can also control the water elimination reaction from hemiaminal intermediate. Considering literature indicates that in most of 1,3-oxazolidine complexes [12–18] a pyridine ring is connected to 1,3-oxazolidine ring while there is only one report on compounds containing phenolic moiety [15] (which is formed in the presence of lanthanide ions and also contains electron withdrawing aldehyde moiety). This matter indicates that electron withdrawing groups like pyridine ring facilitate the formation of 1,3-oxazolidine ring while electron donating groups like phenol derivatives facilitate the formation of Schiff base compounds. So, by employing strong electron withdrawing groups connected to aldehyde/ketone functionality and using 1,2-amino alcohols, selective production of 1,3-oxazolidines is not unreachable. Temperature is also the next effective parameter in this reaction. It is obvious that higher temperature can facilitate water elimination by OH functionality instead of NH group in obtaining 1,3-oxazolidines from hemiaminal intermediate. On the other hand, the coordination chemistry of copper(II) has attracted considerable attention during the last decades which is mainly due to the versatile applications of Cu(II) complexes [22] and their high structural diversities. Copper(II) complexes have been widely used in the fields like magnetism [23], biology [24], biomimetic studies [25], medicine [26] and also in several catalytic reactions (like cycloaddition [27], polymerization [28], CC coupling [29] and oxidation reactions). In oxidation reactions Cu(II) complexes show catalytic activities in the epoxidation of olefins [30], oxidation of alkanes [31], sulfoxidation [32] and oxidation of alcohols [33]. In this paper we report a green reaction methodology under solvent free condition for one-pot and selective synthesis of 1,3-oxazolidine based compound, (2-pyridin-2-yl-1,3-oxazolidine-4,4-diyl)dimethanol (H3L). The coordination potential of this compound was studied in preparing Cu(II) complexes. By considering this fact that the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds is one of the attractive and fundamental reactions in organic synthesis and catalytic studies [33,34], and also in continuous to our studies on the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols [35], the catalytic activity of the obtained Cu(II) complexes were studied in the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols. The effect of various effective parameters in the catalytic oxidation reactions were also studied in order to obtain optimum condition for the catalytic reaction."

6,X-ray crystallography,"2.5 X-ray crystallography The green needle crystals of complex 1 and blue needle crystals of complex 2 were obtained from CH3OH solvent by thermal gradient method. The crystals of complex 1 and 2 are crystallized in orthorhombic space group Pbca and monoclinic space group P2(1)/c, respectively. The X-ray data were collected at 293(2 ) K with an Oxford Sapphire CCD diffractometer using MoKα radiation λ = 0.71073 Å and ω-2θ scans. The analytical absorption correction was applied with the maximum and minimum transmissions of 0.919 and 0.512 (complex 1), 0.891 and 0.693 (complex 2), respectively [36]. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with the use of SHELX2014 program packages [37]. The C-bonded hydrogen atoms were calculated form geometry, the OH and NH hydrogen atoms were located from the difference electron density maps. All hydrogen atoms were constrained during refinement. The molecular structure plots were prepared using Diamond [38]. The data collection and refinement processes are summarized in Table 1 , selected bond lengths and angels are presented in Table 2 and Table S1, respectively."
7,General procedure for catalytic studies,"2.6 General procedure for catalytic studies Oxidation reactions were carried out under aerial condition using 3 ml of solvent and aqueous H2O2 (30 wt%) or TBHP as oxidant. In a typical experiment, the catalyst (complex 1 or 2), the solvent (3 ml) and the substrate (1 mmol) were placed in a 25 ml round bottomed glass flask. The mixture was heated to the desired temperature and after addition of oxidant, the resulting solution was kept stable at the selected temperature to continue the reaction. At appropriate intervals, aliquots were taken and analyzed by GC. The oxidation products were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic samples. Moreover, the progress of the reaction and products were also checked by TLC."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Syntheses and spectroscopy,"3.1 Syntheses and spectroscopy The reaction of 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol with 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde with 1: 1 M ratio in solvent free condition at 110 °C gave the 1,3-oxazolidine based ligand, H3L (Scheme 1a). Although the reaction of primary amines with aldehydes usually generates Schiff base compounds, due to the presence of alcoholic functionalities in suitable position and the presence of electron-withdrawing pyridine ring together with the high temperature we could successfully obtain 1,3-oxazolidine ring instead of the Schiff base compound. It is obvious that 1,3-oxazolidine ring is produced by the attack of alcoholic OH group to the hemiaminal intermediate which terminates to the 1,3-oxazolidine ring by removing a H2O molecule (see Scheme 1a). Higher temperature together with the formation of five membered ring facilitates the formation of 1,3-oxazolidine instead of Schiff base. It is obvious that the presence of pyridine ring as an electron-withdrawing group has also considerable effect in the attack of OH group to the hemiaminal intermediate. The formation of H3L was confirmed by elemental analyses, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy (Figs. S1–S3). In the FT-IR spectrum of H3L, the broad absorption band at 3385 cm−1 can be assigned to the NH and OH groups which the band broadening can be attributed to the hydrogen bond interactions. The characteristic signals for the vibration of CO and CN bonds of oxazolidine ring were observed at 1000–1051 cm−1. In the FT-IR spectrum of H3L the absence of azomethine CN vibration, which usually observes at about 1610 cm−1 [39], indicates the product of the reaction between amine and aldehyde is not a Schiff base compound. Both 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the ligand (see Figs. S2 and S3) indicate that there are two diastereomers in the solution which can be attributed to the chiral carbon atom between nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the 1,3-oxazolidine ring. The copper(II) complexes were synthesized by a similar method from the reaction of H3L and copper(II) chloride dihydrate with different molar ratios in methanol (see Scheme 1). During these synthetic attempts two mononuclear Cu(II) complexes were isolated. The reaction of H3L with CuCl2·2H2O in 1: 1 M ratios afforded complex 1 with the general formula of [Cu(H3L)(Cl)2]·CH3OH as the sole product. In the same reaction system, another mononuclear copper(II) complex with general formula of [Cu(H3L)2]2·2Cl (2) was obtained by changing the molar ratios of materials into 2: 1. Consequently, in this reaction the molar ratio of the reagents has considerable effect on the structure of the final products. Comparing the FT-IR spectra of complexes (Figs. S4 and S5) with free ligand (Fig. S1) shows that some bands of the 1,3-oxazolidine ligand are shifted to lower energies in the FT-IR spectra of complexes. This matter confirms the coordination of 1,3-oxazolidine ring to the metal ion. The bands in the range of 450–530 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra of 1 and 2 can be assigned to the CuN and CuO vibrations [40]. Also, FT-IR spectra of complexes show strong absorption bands at about 3170–3270 cm−1 which can be ascribed to ν(NH) stretching vibration of the oxazolidine ring [41]. The broad peak at about 3370 cm−1 is due to the O–H groups of H3L involved in hydrogen bonding interactions [41,42]. The electronic spectra of complex 1 (green), complex 2 (blue) and H3L (colourless) in methanol are shown in Fig. 1 . The ligand (H3L) displays strong bands at 213 and 260 nm which can be assigned to π → π ∗ transitions and the shoulder at about 280 nm can be attributed to n → π ∗ transitions. The shifts of the bands in complexes relative to the free ligand indicate the coordination of H3L to Cu(II) ion. For complexes, the broad band at about 300–350 nm is due to the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions. The other higher energy intense transitions at about 217 and 260 nm are due to intraligand transitions. Both 1 and 2 exhibit a weak broad band in the range of 600–700 nm which is related to d-d transitions [43]."
10,Crystal structure of complex 1,"3.2 Crystal structure of complex 1 The molecular structure of complex [Cu(H3L)(Cl)2]·CH3OH (1), determined by X-ray analysis, is shown in Fig. 2 a and selected bond lengths and angles are presented in Table 2 and Table S1, respectively. This complex crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system (space group Pbca). X-ray analysis showed that 1 is a neutral mononuclear complex of Cu(II) which is obtained by the coordination of one molecule of H3L ligand and two chloride anions to the Cu(II) ion. A methanol molecule is also located beside the complex molecule which is stabilized in the crystal structure by hydrogen bond interactions. The ligand is coordinated to the metal ion as a neutral tridentate ligand through nitrogen atom of pyridine ring, nitrogen atom of oxazolidine ring and the oxygen atom of one of the alcoholic groups. Both alcoholic oxygen and oxazolidine nitrogen are coordinated to the Cu(II) as neutral groups without loosing the hydrogen atom. The Cu(II) ion in 1 has a distorted square pyramidal geometry (CuN2OCl2 coordination environment) with τ = 0.06 (where τ = difference between the two largest angles/60; τ = 1 for ideal trigonal–bipyramidal and τ = 0 for ideal square-pyramidal). Two coordinated chloride anions and two nitrogen atoms of H3L (Noxazolindine and Npyridine) form the equatorial plane of the square pyramidal geometry and the axial position is occupied by the oxygen atom of the coordinated alcoholic arm. The axial CuO bond length is longer than the other bonds which is consistent with the Z-out Jahn–Teller effect usually found in Cu(II) complexes with a d9 electronic configuration [44]. The bond lengths around the atoms in oxazolidine ring is very close to the bond lengths in previously reported 1,3-oxazolidines [12–18]. The bond lengths and angels around the carbon atom connected to the N and O atoms of the 1,3-oxazolidines ring (C6) are in agreement with sp3 hybridization. This matter shows that the hybridization of this atom is changed from sp2 in the starting aldehyde to sp3 in the final product. Due to the presence of chloride atoms, methanol molecule, oxazolidine ring and alcoholic functionality in the structure of complex 1, the presence of strong and directed hydrogen bond interactions is predictable for this compound. Parameters of hydrogen bonding geometries in the structure of complex 1 are given in Table S2. The coordinated alcoholic group and the NH group of oxazolidine ring form hydrogen bonds with the coordinated chloride atom of the neighboring complex. Uncoordinated alcoholic arm of H3L also forms OH⋯O hydrogen bond with uncoordinated methanol molecule. As a result, a 1D polymeric chain is generated by these interactions (see Fig. 2b)."
11,Crystal structure of complex 2,"3.3 Crystal structure of complex 2 The needle blue crystals of complex 2 crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system (P2(1)/c space group). X-ray analysis indicated that the unit cell in complex 2 contains two crystallographically independent molecules (Fig. 3 a). However, the overlay of these two molecules shows that they are almost identical (Fig. 3b). The structures of these two molecules are shown in Fig. 3 and selected bond lengths and angles around the metal centers are collected in Table 2 and Table S1, respectively. In complex 2 the Cu atoms are located on the center of symmetry and two parts of molecules are related to each other by symmetry operation (i = −x+1,−y,−z + 1). In 2, two molecules of ligand are coordinated to the metal ion as neutral tridentate N2O-donor ligands. Therefore, this compound is a cationic complex and two chloride anions are located beside it as counter anions. The coordination environment around the Cu(II) centers (trans-CuN4O2) is best described as distorted octahedral geometry which is provided by coordination of one oxygen and two nitrogen atoms of two H3L ligands. The equatorial position of octahedral geometry is created by coordination of four nitrogen atoms (two N-pyridine and two N-oxazolidine) and the axial positions are occupied by the oxygen atoms of alcoholic groups. The axial CuO bonds are considerably longer than the equatorial CuN bonds which can be attributed to the Z-out Jahn-Teller distortion. The CuN and CuO bonds are in the normal range reported for Cu(II) complexes [45]. The chloride anions, located beside the complex molecules, are stabilized in the crystal packing by strong and directed OH⋯Cl, CH⋯Cl and NH⋯Cl interactions (see Fig. 3c and Table S2). A 2D polymeric network is generated by these interactions."
12,Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"3.4 Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol The catalytic activity of complexes 1 and 2 was tested in the oxidation of bezylic alcohols in the presence of aqueous H2O2 (30%) as a cheap, safe and green oxidant. According to previous studies the catalytic oxidation of organic substrates in the presence of transition metal complexes can be affected by some parameters like temperature, the nature of oxidant, time, solvent, etc [35,46]. Therefore, we studied the effect of some important parameters in order to find the optimum conditions for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of complexes 1 and 2. The results of these studies are summarized in Table 3 . In the control reactions (in the absence of catalyst or oxidant) the oxidation of benzyl alcohol did not occur after 5 h. The results of these experiments revealed that the presence of both catalyst and oxidant (H2O2) is essential for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The effect of oxidant to substrate ratio is one of the key parameters influencing on this type of catalytic reactions. Thus, oxidations of benzyl alcohol with different H2O2: bezylic alcohol molar ratios were carried out at 70 °C. The reactions were done by using 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 M ratios of H2O2: benzyl alcohol in acetonitrile as solvent. The profile for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is depicted in Scheme 2 , which shows the oxidation reaction can proceed via two steps: (1) oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and (2) oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid. The analyses of the reactions showed benzyl alcohol was oxidized to both benzaldehyde and benzoic acid in the reaction condition. Benzaldehyde was the main product of the catalytic reaction, but nevertheless, some amounts of benzoic acid were also formed as the side product by over oxidation of benzaldehyde. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 4 which indicates the conversion of benzyl alcohol increases continuously as time increases and then remains relatively constant after about 120 min. This can be attributed to the bleaching of the catalyst or to the other deactivation reactions which cause to decrease the catalytic acitivty. After 120 min the selectivity was decreased by increasing the amount of benzoic acid. Higher amounts of H2O2 led to a growth in the conversions but the selectivity toward the aldehyde was decreased. This matter shows that the higher amount of oxidant facilitates over oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid. The highest selectivity in aldehyde formation with reasonably high conversion efficiency was obtained with 2 equiv. of H2O2. Therefore, this ratio was selected as the optimum molar ratio of oxidant: substrate in other experiments. In order to get the best reaction temperature, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was studied at different temperatures (room temperature, 40, 60, 70 and 80 °C), and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . At room temperature, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was low. Increasing temperature from 25 to 70 °C increased the conversion but the selectivity toward aldehyde was also decreased at higher temperatures. At 80 °C, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was almost the same as 70 °C. This matter can be attributed to over oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid since at 80 °C the selectivity of aldehyde was significantly decreased. It is obvious that there is a competition between oxidation of benzaldehyde and oxidation of benzyl alcohol at higher temperatures. Although maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol was higher at 70 °C, since selectivity toward aldehyde was better at 60 °C, this temperature was considered as the optimum temperature for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The solvent effect in the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was also investigated (Table 3, Fig. 6 ). For this purpose, acetonitrile, toluene, methanol, chloroform, dichloromethane, DMF, THF and ethyl acetate were used as solvents in other catalytic reactions. It was observed that the catalytic activity of the catalyst decreased with respect to acetonitrile > acetone > ethyl acetate > dichloromethane > THF > methanol > chloroform > toluene > DMF. The solvent has a significant effect on the reaction even though the details of the exact role of the solvent is not very clear. However, it is known that acetonitrile also affect on the activation of H2O2 by forming a perhydroxyl anion (OOH−) or other oxygen transfer intermediates. In addition, acetonitrile has a comparatively good solubility, high dielectric constant and low donor number (coordination ability). Low catalytic activity in DMF can be attributed to its high coordination ability. In order to study the effect of the oxidant nature, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was investigated in the presence of TBHP instead of H2O2. The results of these studies are summarized in Table 3 which indicates that the nature of the oxidant has also significant effect on this catalytic system. In general, the results show that both conversion and selectivity are better when TBHP was used as oxidant. This matter can be attributed to weaker OO bond in TBHP respect to H2O2. Better selectivity in TBHP maybe is related to the steric hindrance of TBHP which can affect on the oxidation process. The catalytic activity of complex 2 was examined under the optimized conditions obtained for complex 1 (H2O2/benzyl alcohol molar ratio = 2, acetonitrile, reaction temperature 60 °C). The catalytic activity of complex 2 was lower than complex 1 which can be attributed to its octahedral coordination geometry and higher steric hindrance. The available space around the metal ion to interact with the oxidant and substrate is limited in the case of complex 2. The metal core in complex 1 with square pyramidal geometry has more available environment to interact with the reagents and shows higher catalytic activity. However, the selectivity of complex 2 toward aldehyde is higher than complex 1 which can be also due to the higher steric hindrance around the metal ion in this complex."
13,Oxidation of chloro-substituted benzyl alcohols,"3.5 Oxidation of chloro-substituted benzyl alcohols To explore the potential of complex 1 in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols, ortho-, meta- and para-chloro substituted benzyl alcohols were selected as substrates. The catalytic reactions were performed under the optimized condition obtained for benzyl alcohol and the summary of results is collected in Table 4 . Chloro-substituted benzyl alcohols were also oxidized to aldehyde by 1 in the presence of H2O2. Generally, all these substrates showed lower conversion than benzyl alcohol but their selectivity toward aldehyde was considerably better. This matter indicates that both selectivity and efficiency of this catalytic system are dependent on the electronic and steric demands of the chlorine group. The substrate with chlorine substituent on the ortho- position showed poor activity in comparison with the corresponding meta- and para-substituted substrates. This matter can be attributed to the higher steric hindrance in the former case. Low conversion of substrate with the chlorine substituent on the meta-position relative to the para- can be attributed to the higher electron-withdrawing effect of the Cl group at this position. Although the details of catalytic mechanism are not studied in the present work and the total mechanism of the reaction is not fully clear, on the basis of the electronic absorption spectroscopy studies (Figs. S6 and S7) and also by considering the previous studies on catalytic oxidation reactions by copper(II) complexes [47], it is predicted that the key step in this catalytic process is the oxidation of substrates by a peroxido-copper species formed after addition of H2O2 to the solution of complex. Although such species are not identified in this study, electronic absorption spectroscopic studies (see Figs. S6 and S7) indicate that the solutions of complexes 1 and 2 are sensitive towards addition of H2O2. By increasing H2O2 to the methanolic solution of complexes 1 and 2, the intensity of absorption band at about 200–300 nm increases. These changes can be attributed to the interaction of Cu(II) complexes with H2O2 and the formation of peroxido-copper species that oxidize the substrate [47]."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, 1,3-oxazolidine based ligand, H3L, was selectively synthesized in solvent free condition at 110 °C. Two new Cu(II) complexes, [Cu(H3L)Cl2]·CH3OH (1) and [Cu(H3L)2]·2Cl (2), were synthesized by the reaction of H3L and CuCl2·H2O in methanol. The ligand and its Cu(II) complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods. The structure of complexes was also studied by single crystal X-ray analysis which revealed square pyramidal and octahedral geometry around the Cu(II) ions in 1 and 2, respectively. The catalytic activity of complexes was studied in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol and its chloro-substituted derivatives with H2O2 or TBHP as oxidant. The results of catalytic reactions showed that these complexes can catalyze the oxidation of primary benzyl alcohols but the reaction conditions such as the nature and molar ratio of oxidant, temperature, solvent and the electronic and steric effects of the substrate are some important parameters in the activity and selectivity of these catalytic systems."
