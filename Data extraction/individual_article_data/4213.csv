0,Introduction,"The catalytic conversion of syngas to ethanol and higher alcohols (C2+ alcohols) has been of great interest [1–5] for the production of alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels and chemicals [6–8]. According to previous reports [9,10], efficient formation of ethanol and/or higher alcohols from syngas requires both C–C coupling of surface alkyl intermediates for carbon chain lengthening and prompt insertion of molecular CO into surface alkyl intermediates. The direct hydrogenation of molecular CO affords methanol [11,12], and no CO insertion to surface alkyl intermediates affords hydrocarbons [13,14]. The acyl species (C x H y –CO) are efficiently formed only when the kinetics of CO insertion matches that of C–C coupling, and they are then hydrogenated to ethanol or higher alcohols [15]. Therefore, the expected selectivity to C2+ alcohol product raises great challenges to catalysts for syngas conversion. The catalyst should be designed at atomic scale bearing active sites capable of activating CO in both dissociation and nondissociation modes to maximize the match between carbon-chain growth and CO insertion for higher alcohol synthesis. Co, Fe, or Ni catalysts for F–T synthesis are competent in CO dissociation, owing to low dissociative chemisorption energies [16]. Addition of a second component (such as Pd or Cu) to Co [17–30], Fe [31–45], or Ni [36] could enhance nondissociative CO adsorption. Combination of the metal sites in varied valences, such as Co0–Coδ+ [37–40] or Mo0–MoO(2− x ) [41], is also a way to improve the selectivity to ethanol or even higher alcohols. In this case, the low-valence center is the active site for CO dissociation, hydrogenation, and chain growth to form surface alkyl species, while the high-valence center is the active site for the insertion of molecularly absorbed CO [39,41]. More and more studies have pointed out that homogeneous and in-vicinity distribution of active sites for CO dissociative and nondissociative adsorption is essential to facilitating the insertion of molecularly adsorbed CO into surface alkyl intermediates and to the final formation of higher alcohols [19,42]. The yield of higher alcohols is maximized due to the CuCo alloy contribution [28], which is supported by the reduced CO insertion barriers on the Cu–Co boundary surface [43]. Higher yields for higher alcohols have been achieved on the catalyst with a CoCu alloy phase produced by oxalate co-precipitation [27,30], layered precursor [29], or perovskite route [20] methods. Intimate contact between Cu and Co sites facilitates synergic catalysis, favoring the formation of C2+ alcohols. Similar synergetic effects are observed with Cu–Fe x C y catalysts, in which the active α-Fe5C2 sites for chain growth intimately surround the defective and strained Cu sites [35]. Recently, it has been reported that the interface between Co2C and Co metal is essential for the production of C2+ alcohols (C2–C18) [40,44–46]. The synergetic effects of the Co2C sites for CO nondissociative adsorption with the Co metal sites for CO dissociative adsorption and subsequent carbon-chain growth selectively produce C2+ alcohols. CoGa nanoparticles are a novel catalyst developed by our group for effective conversion of syngas to ethanol and higher alcohols [47]. Supported CoGa nanoparticles originating from direct thermal reduction of Co- and Ga-containing layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as precursors, with Co and Ga pseudo-homogeneously distributed and CoGa particles well dispersed and trapped in an oxide support, provide higher selectivity to C2+ alcohols under higher CO conversion and exhibit excellent stability in catalysis [47]. The mechanism of promotion of Ga to Co catalytic sites in the pseudo-homogeneously distributed CoGa catalysts and the possible synergic catalysis between Co and CoGa sites merit much attention for more effective design of catalysts for ethanol and higher alcohols synthesis from syngas."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation,"2.1 Preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of LDHs CoGaZnAl-LDHs with various molar Ga/Co ratios (x=0.3, 0.6, and 1.0) were synthesized in situ on the surface of spherical γ-Al2O3 to obtain Co1GaxZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 precursors [48]. Typically, 0.0873 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.2678 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.0190 g of Ga (NO3)3·xH2O, and 0.2403 g of urea were first dissolved in 1.5 mL of deionized water. The resulting mixed solution was transferred to a 15 mL autoclave. Then 1.0 g of γ-Al2O3 (20–40 mesh) was added to the above solution as both the substrate and Al source. The autoclave was sealed tightly. The mixture was shaken in a table concentrator for 2 h at room temperature and then heated in an oven at 100 °C for another 12 h. The resulting solid was washed thoroughly with deionized water and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h, giving Co1Ga0.3ZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3. CoZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 and ZnGaAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 samples were synthesized following the same procedure. 2.1.2 Reduction Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 with various molar Ga/Co ratios (x = 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0) was prepared through the in situ reduction of Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3. Typically, about 1 g of Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 was put into a quartz boat, which was placed at the center of a horizontal quartz tube inserted into a furnace at atmosphere pressure. After the removal of air, the furnace was heated under flowing H2 (40 mL/min) at 5 °C/min to 700 °C and maintained at 700 °C for 2 h, affording Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3. When the furnace was cooled to room temperature, the Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 sample was passivated in a flow of 1% O2–N2 for 1 h, except for the samples for EXAFS and in situ XPS characterizations. For comparison, Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 and Ga-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 were prepared following the same process by the reduction of CoZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 and ZnGaAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3. The reduced samples were preserved under N2 for characterizations or pretreatment prior to characterization."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 powder diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The XRD patterns for all the samples were collected with a scanning angle (2θ) range of 3–70° at a scanning rate of 5°/min. Quantitative analysis for Co and Ga elements was performed using a Shimadzu ICPS-75000 inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP-ES). N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were carried out on Quantachrome Autosorb-1 system. The samples were outgassed in N2 flow at 120 °C for 2 h prior to measurement. The specific surface area was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1C-VP analyzer. SEM images were taken on a Zeiss Supra 55 scanning electron microscope. TEM and HRTEM images were taken on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN operated at 300 kV. The elemental line scanning was taken in STEM mode. The samples for STEM measurements were treated in ethanol under ultrasonic conditions before being deposited on a Cu microgrid, and covered by a carbon coating of several nanometers to eventually prevent magnetization. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature-programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD), and temperature-programmed desorption of CO (CO-TPD) were carried out on a Micrometric ChemiSorb 2750 chemisorption instrument with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For H2-TPR, Co1GaxZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 samples (∼0.1 g) were pretreated in a flow of Ar (40 mL/min) at 400 °C for 1 h to remove water and then was cooled to 30 °C. H2-TPR profiles were recorded from 30 °C to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a flow of 10% H2-Ar (40 mL/min). For H2-TPD, the Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 sample (∼0.1 g) was pretreated in a flow of 10% H2–Ar (40 mL/min) at 400 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 100 °C, held at 100 °C for 1 h for H2 absorption, and then purged in a flow of Ar (40 mL/min). The H2-TPD profile was recorded from 100 to 450 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and held at 450 °C for 2 h in a flow of Ar (40 mL/min). Calculations for Co dispersion were made using the total amount of adsorbed hydrogen and a stoichiometry of one hydrogen atom per cobalt surface atom. Meanwhile, the dispersion was determined from TEM images by the particle mean size assuming a surface atom density of 14.6 Co atoms/nm2. For CO-TPD, the Co1Gax-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 sample (∼0.1 g) was pretreated in a flow of 10% H2–Ar (40 mL/min) at 400 °C for 1 h and then was cooled to 30 °C with a flow of Ar (40 mL/min). CO flow was switched into at 30 °C for CO absorption for 1 h and then purged by a flow of Ar (40 mL/min). The CO-TPD profiles were recorded from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a flow of Ar (40 mL/min). The Co K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (XAFS) were recorded in transmission mode at room temperature at beam line 1W1B at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science. Co1Ga x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 samples were treated in situ under flowing H2 (40 mL/min) at 5 °C/min to 400 °C and maintained at 400 °C for 1 h prior to characterization. A Si(III) double crystal was used to monochromatize the X-rays from the 700 MeV electron storage ring. EXAFS data were examined using the Athena and Artemis programs. Surface elemental analysis was performed using a Kratos Amicus X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with MgK α radiation. Co1Ga x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 samples were treated in situ under flowing H2 (10 mL/min) at 5 °C/min to 260 °C and maintained at 260 °C at 3 atm for 2 h prior to characterization. Then the XPS characterization was performed under vacuum at room temperature. The C1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as a calibration peak. In situ FT-IR spectra for adsorbed CO were recorded on a Nicolet 380 model (Thermo Electron Corporation) equipped with an MCT-A detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. A KBr beamsplitter was used to obtain spectra in the range 4000–650 cm−1. The spectrum was collected at a spectrum resolution of 1 cm−1 in an accumulation of 64 scans. About 20 mg of the sample was pressed into a disk for each experiment. After being pretreated in situ in flowing H2 at 400 °C for 1 h, the cell was flushed with N2 flow to 30 °C. Then the background was collected at 30 °C. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to CO flow for 1 h and then purged with N2 to remove gaseous CO. Each spectrum was recorded under the N2 flow. For the spent catalysts, before pretreatment, the preactivation was first carried out to remove the possible surface carbon deposition from 30 to 550 °C C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a flow of air and the catalysts were held at 550 °C for 1 h. The site fractions χ was calculated using previously reported extinction coefficients ε for the linear and bridge modes of CO on Rh and the following equation reported in the literature [49]: χ = I / ( ε × f ) ∑ i = 1 n [ I i / ( ε i × f i ] . The peak intensity Ii was determined from deconvolution using Omnic software. The extinction coefficients ε used for the linear and bridge configurations were 26 and 85 (×108) (cm/mol), respectively [49]. According to a report on single-crystal Pt [50], the extinction coefficients ε used for the linear configuration on the undercoordinated Pt site is a factor of 2.7 greater than that on the well-coordinated Pt site. Extinction coefficients ε for the two bands in linear configuration were 26.0 and 96.2 (×108) (cm/mol), respectively. The value of f corresponding to the stoichiometric number of CO: Co ratios is 1 and 0.5 for the linear and bridge configurations."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The catalytic test was performed with a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor. A sample of 0.6 g of catalyst (20–40 mesh, 1 mL) was loaded into the reactor tube (ϕ = 10 mm, L = 38 cm). The remaining volume of the reactor tube was filled with quartz sand (20–40 mesh). Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was preactivated in situ in H2 (2000 h−1) for 1 h at 400 °C. After the reactor was cooled to 50 °C, the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature at a ramp rate of 2 °C/min and with a syngas (H2/CO = 2.0, 5% Ar as internal standard) flow rate of 2000 h−1 (GHSV(CO+H2)). The reaction was carried out at 260 °C and 3 MPa. After passing through a hot trap (180 °C) and a cold trap (0 °C), the tail gas was analyzed online by GC. Ar, CO, CH4, and CO2 were analyzed through a TDX-1 packed column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using He as carrier gas. C1–C5 hydrocarbons were analyzed through an Al2O3-packed column with an N2 carrier and a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). The aqueous and oil liquid products, collected from a cold trap and a hot trap, were analyzed offline by GC. The aqueous products, containing alcohols mostly, were analyzed through GSBP-INOWAX with N2 carrier and FID. Sec-butyl alcohol was used as an internal standard. The liquid oil products were diluted in cyclohexane solvent and analyzed through a DB-5 column with N2 carrier and FID. Ethyl cyclohexane was used as an internal standard. The CO conversion (χ CO), turnover frequency (TOF), and product selectivity were calculated according to the following equations: χ CO = F CO in - F CO out F CO in × 100 % S C i = F C i × i F CO in - F CO out × 100 % S ROH = ∑ i = 1 n S C i H 2 i OH TOF = GHSV ( CO + H 2 ) 3600 × V C at × CO % × χ CO m C at × w % M Co × D × ( 1 × χ linear + 2 × χ bridge ) where F is the moles of CO and product Ci (CO2, hydrocarbon, or alcohols) containing i carbon atoms. w% is the mass percentage of Co in the catalyst and D is the Co dispersion from H2 TPD, as calculated in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information. V Cat, CO%, and m Cat are set as 0.001 L, 33.3%, and 59 g/mol, respectively. CO can adsorb onto Co sites in two main configurations in this work, linear and bridge configurations, which exhibit CO to Co ratios (CO:Co) of 1:1 and 1:2. According to a reported method [49], TOF values are related to site fractions (χ) of Co sites with CO adsorbed in linear or bridge geometry, which could be obtained from the CO probe FT-IR analysis. The catalytic results after 15 h reaction are discussed. The mass balance and carbon balance have been calculated at each product and kept between 90 and 95%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Co and CoGa sites,"3.1 Co and CoGa sites The supported CoGa samples with varied Ga/Co ratios (denoted as Co1Ga x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, where x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0) were produced by the in situ reduction of Co1Ga x ZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 in H2 at 700 °C for 2 h (see Figs. S1–S3​ in the Supplementary Information for SEM images and XRD patterns). No reflections of Co and/or CoGa phases are resolved in the XRD patterns, but Co and/or CoGa particles are clearly observed in the STEM images (Fig. 1 ). The metal particles show no notable difference in mean size and size distribution, and all have the (1 1 1) facet exposed. The lattice spacing of the (1 1 1) facet is 0.202 nm for the Co particle in Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 and increases to 0.207, 0.210, and 0.213 nm for the CoGa particles in Co1Ga0.3-, Co1Ga0.6-, and Co1Ga1.0-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3. As revealed by an EDS line scan profile, Ga is mainly detected at the position where Co exists, indicative of the pseudo-homogeneous distribution. In each case, the Co content is approximately 1.5 wt.% and the Ga content varies from 0.59 to 1.63 wt.% (Table S1 in the Supplementary Information). The surface Co/Ga ratio is rather close to the bulk (Table S1), confirming the pseudo-homogeneous distribution of Co and Ga. H2 TPR profiles of Co1Ga x -ZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 (x = 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0) are shown in Fig. S4 ​in the Supplementary Information. Compared with H2-TPR profiles of ZnGaAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 and CoZnAl-LDHs/γ-Al2O3 reported in our previous paper [47], H2 consumption for Co1Ga x -ZnAl-LDH/γ-Al2O3 (x = 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0) between 500 and 700 °C is attributed to the reduction of Co (II) to Co0 and Ga (III) to Ga0. The reduction temperature of 700 °C could ensure the reduction of most Co (II) to Co0 and part of Ga (III) to Ga0. With the presence of Ga, the first nearest-neighbor distance shifts to a high R value (Fig. 2 A). By fitting the Co K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. S5 and Table S2 in the Supplementary Information), the coordination number for the Co atoms in Co1Ga x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 is found to be much lower in each case than for those in Co foil. The Co–Co distance (2.49 Å) in Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 agrees well with that in Co foil, but the average Co–M distances in the presence of Ga are all larger than the Co–Co distance and rise from 2.50 to 2.52 Å with increasing Ga loading (Fig. 2B). It can be learned from Artemis software that the Ga–Ga coordination distance in pure Ga0 is approximately 2.68 Å (ICSD 43539). Thus, the increase in Co–M distance is assumed to result from the replacement of Co with Ga atoms, forming Co–Ga coordination. In the in situ XPS spectra (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Information), the binding energy of Co02p 3/2 [51] shifts from778.3 eV for the Co0 in Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 to 777.5 eV for the Co0 in Co1Ga0.3-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, and declines gradually with increasing Ga/Co ratio. Accordingly, the binding energy of Ga02p 3/2 [52] increases from 1117.2 eV for GaZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 to 1117.8 eV for Co1Ga0.3-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, and the binding energy of Ga3+2p 3/2 [52] increases from 1119.1 to 1119.5 eV. The binding energies of both Ga02p 3/2 and Ga3+2p 3/2 rise with increasing Ga/Co ratio (Fig. 3 ). The increase in the electronic density of Co0 sites and the decrease in the electronic density of Ga sites indicates electron transfer from Ga sites to Co sites in Co–Ga coordination. According to the quantitative analysis of in situ XPS spectra (Table S3 in the Supplementary Information), despite a small amount of metal species, most Ga is present as oxide species. In light of the fact that Ga sites are mainly present as oxide species, the electron transfer is mainly contributed by Ga3+ sites. The Co–Ga coordination facilitates the reduction of Ga3+ sites, promoting the Ga0 fraction from 15% to 40% (Table S3)."
7,Promoted CO insertion and C–C coupling in syngas conversion,"3.2 Promoted CO insertion and C–C coupling in syngas conversion The resulting CoGa x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 was used as the catalyst for syngas conversion (Table 1 ). Both hydrocarbons and alcohols were produced for each Ga/Co ratio. Hydrocarbons were predominantly yielded (up to 68.5% selectivity) on Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, with a selectivity to alcohols (ROH) of 29.6%. The selectivity to alcohols (>50%) was remarkably promoted on Ga-containing Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3. Especially on Co1Ga0.6-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, the selectivity to alcohols (59.1%) was approximately double that on Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 (29.6%). The promotion of alcohol selectivity suggests the enhancement of CO insertion by Ga coexistence. But it is interesting that, in addition to the selectivity to methane, the fraction of methanol in the total alcohol products decreased and the C2+ alcohol fraction increased with coexisting Ga. The C2+ alcohols fraction reached 92.9 wt.% with approximately 29.1 wt.% C6+ alcohols. The unique higher alcohol selectivity of the Ga-doped catalysts is substantiated by the repeat experiments (Table 1). Reactions were also carried out at different temperatures on CoGa x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0; Fig. 4 ). The results demonstrate that the unique higher alcohol selectivity and C2+ alcohol selectivity of the Ga-doped Co catalysts are consistent across broader temperature conditions. Increasing reaction temperature results in a continuous increase in catalytic activity. Co1Ga0.6-ZnAl-LDO/γ-A2O3 shows higher conversion than other CoGa x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 at each temperature (Fig. 4A). A CO conversion of 43.5% is obtained at 260 °C on Co1Ga0.6-ZnAl-LDO/γ-A2O3, while 288 °C is required on Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 to reach the same conversion (Fig. 4A). For alcohol selectivity (Fig. 4B) and C2+ alcohol fraction (Fig. 4C), Co1Ga0.6-ZnAl-LDO/γ-A2O3 also shows remarkable superiority to other CoGa x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 at each temperature, especially higher than that for Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3. Both alcohols and hydrocarbons catalyzed by CoGa x -ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0) at 260 °C followed an approximate Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution (Fig. 5 ). The α values for both alcohols and hydrocarbons increased with the introduction of a Ga component. The observations indicated that the chain growth probability was also enhanced by the coexistence of Ga. The α values for alcohols were always lower than those for hydrocarbons at each Ga/Co ratio (Fig. 5), indicating that the CoGa catalysts have greater chain growth capability. But the difference in α values between alcohols and hydrocarbons became smaller with increasing Ga/Co ratio, indicating that the CO insertion probability approached to chain growth probability gradually with increasing Ga loading. Almost no conversion of CO was observed on ZnGaAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, indicative of the primary contribution from Co-involved sites to the syngas transformation. It should be noted that the by-product CO2, which is unwanted but frequently reported to be difficult to exclude [53] in the transformation of syngas, was successfully controlled to be below 2% on Co or CoGa catalysts in this work. It is not difficult to understand the enhancement of CO insertion probability, because increasing Ga loading afforded incremental Co–Ga coordination, as revealed by EXAFS results. More Co–Ga linkages gave more isolated Co sites that possibly accounted for linear adsorption of CO. As for the enhancement of chain growth probability, it probably resulted from the increased electronic density of Co sites owing to electronic donation from Ga, as revealed by in situ XPS results. The FT-IR spectra for CO adsorption (Fig. 6 ) well confirmed the deduction. In previous reports [50,54], the absorption bands around 2037 and 2023 cm−1 (Fig. 6A) were ascribed to the linear CO adsorption on the well-coordinated and undercoordinated isolated Co0 atoms (Coisolated sites) [55]. With increasing Ga loading, the absorption around 2037 cm−1 increased in intensity while 2023 cm−1 was maintained (Fig. 6B), indicating an increment in the number of well-coordinated Coisolated sites and an unchanged number of undercoordinated Coisolated. It is deduced that Ga is doped in the terraces of the particles rather than the steps, edges, or corners of the particle. The quantitative estimation of Coisolated and Coadjacent sites (Fig. 6C) revealed that the fraction of Coadjacent sites decreased while the fraction of Coisolated sites increased with increasing Ga/Co ratio. The fraction of Coisolated sites rose to nearly 53% at a Co/Ga molar ratio of 1. It is well known that linearly absorbed CO favors nondissociative CO adsorption, which is indispensable for CO insertion [56], the key step toward alcohol synthesis from syngas. The absorption bands at about 2003 and 1985 cm−1 (Fig. 6A) might arise from the CO bound in bridging geometries to neighboring Co atoms (Coadjacent site) at steps and terraces of the particles. With increasing Ga loading, the absorption around 1985 cm−1 shifted to lower wavenumber (from 1990 to 1982 cm−1) while 2003 cm−1 was maintained, further indicating that Ga is doped in the terraces of the particles (Fig. 6B). The lower CO stretching frequency indicated weaker CO π-bonds, which resulted from stronger metal–carbon (M–CO) binding. Strong metal–carbon (M–CO) binding is favored by electron-rich metal centers due to π-back bonding, which at the same time weakens the CO triple bond. It is deduced that Ga donation to Co caused the decrease in the asymmetric stretching frequency. More detailed investigation is needed to completely verify the deduction. The lower the CO asymmetric stretching frequency, the weaker the CO π-bonds, and the easier the CO bond cleavage. Thus, it is clear from the FT-IR spectra for CO adsorption that the incremental Coisolated sites promoted the CO insertion probability and the electronic-rich Coadjacent sites owing to the electronic donation from Ga to coordinated Coadjacent, accelerated the chain growth probability. But it is interesting that neither the selectivity to alcohols nor the chain growth probability for hydrocarbons displayed a simple rise with increasing fraction of Coisolated sites or electronic density of Co0 centers. Either alcohol selectivity or chain growth probability shows a maximum, hinting at synergic catalysis between Coisolated sites for CO insertion and Coadjacent sites for C–C coupling. FT-IR spectra of CO absorbed onto spent catalysts have been investigated, as shown in Fig. S7. The linear and bridge adsorption for the CO on spent catalysts are located at the same wavenumbers as on the fresh catalysts (Fig. 6). Similarly to the observations for the fresh catalysts, with increasing Ga loading, the linear adsorption for the CO around 2040 cm−1 increased in intensity while 2022 cm−1 was maintained, and the bridge adsorption for the CO around 1989 cm−1 shifted to lower wavenumber (from 1992 cm−1 to 1986 cm−1) while 2005 cm−1 was maintained (Fig. S7 ​in the Supplementary Information). This clearly substantiates that the Co site distribution has been well maintained. The FT-IR spectra of CO absorbed onto spent (Fig. S7) and fresh (Fig. 6) catalysts could well account for the Ga promotion mechanism. Moreover, TOF values assuming bridged or linear adsorption onto Co sites can be calculated based on the Co sites fraction (χ). As shown in Table 1, Co1Ga0.6-ZnAl-LDO/γ-A2O3 also presents remarkable superiority to Co1Ga0.3-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 and Co1Ga1.0-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3, especially higher than that for Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3. In the CO-TPD profiles (Fig. 7 A), in addition to the desorption peaks around 100 °C and at 500–540 °C, one appeared at 210–230 °C. This observation differed from those in the literature [57], where only the desorption around 100 °C due to weakly adsorbed CO and the one at 500–540 °C arising from strongly adsorbed CO have been observed. The desorption peak at 210–230 °C, resulting from the CO adsorbed in moderate binding, was weak in intensity for Co-ZnAl-LDO/γ-Al2O3 but became much more intense in the presence of Ga. According to a previous report [58], the desorption peaks around 500–540 and 210–230 °C are substantiated to be dissociative and nondissociative adsorption, respectively. Based on the area of the desorption peak, the fraction of dissociatively or nondissociatively absorbed CO is estimated and shown as a function of Coisolated site fraction in Fig. 7B. As expected, the fraction of nondissociatively adsorbed CO, the species inserted into the surface alkyl for higher alcohol synthesis, increased from 24.5 to 43.4% as the Coisolated site fraction increased, while the fraction of dissociatively adsorbed CO decreased. It is worthy of note that the nondissociative and dissociative CO fractions approached each other at a Coisolated site fraction of approximate 46%, where better alcohol selectivity was achieved. This means that the match of CO insertion and C–C coupling is the key to optimizing the production of ethanol and higher alcohols from syngas. The desorption of strongly adsorbed CO shifted gradually to higher temperature with increasing Ga loading, indicative of stronger binding of CO to electron-transferred Co sites from Ga, which is consistent with the FT-IR results of CO adsorption and the in situ XPS results. XRD patterns (Fig. S8 ​in the Supplementary Information) indicate that the spent catalysts well maintained the structure of the fresh catalysts, in accordance with the CO probe FT-IR analysis (Fig. S7). No reflections of the Co2C phase are observed, despite the synergic catalysis between Co2C and Co metal that has been reported to be essential for the production of C2+ alcohols (C2–C18) [40,44–46]. The support applied in this work for CoGa particles is ZnAl-LDO, an oxide with Al in the lattice of ZnO. The interfacial promotion effects of ZnO support through the formation of Zn–M bimetallic sites or ZnO–M interfacial sites has recently been the subject of intense debate [59–61]. But the promoting role of Zn in the catalysis has not been considered in this work, since in all the samples of this work Zn is present in a large amount."
8,Conclusions,"In conclusion, this work revealed the role of Ga in improving the selectivity to alcohols, especially to C2+ alcohols, in syngas conversion on the novel CoGa catalyst. The linkage of Ga to Co contributed to not only isolating the Co site but also donating electrons to Co atoms. The isolated Co sites are responsible for linearly nondissociative CO adsorption, boosting the CO insertion step to produce alcohols. The adjacent electron-rich Co sites are efficient for CO dissociative adsorption and the subsequent C–C coupling, which is inevitable for carbon-chain growth. Impressive selectivity to ethanol and higher alcohols were achieved at a Ga/Co ratio of 0.6, where CO insertion matched the C–C coupling. This work provides important information for the design of effective catalysts for ethanol and higher alcohol synthesis from syngas."
