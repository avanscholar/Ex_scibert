0,Introduction,"Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been studied for long time both theoretically and experimentally because HER is one of the most simple electrochemical reactions [1–8]. Recently, it attracts many research groups' attention due to the importance of hydrogen production by water electrolysis combined with solar- or wind-generated electricity as one of the most promising processes to realize sustainable energy system [9]. For water electrolysis to become a practical hydrogen production process, it is essential to avoid using platinum group metals and their alloys, which are known to be the most efficient electrocatalysts for HER but are expensive and less abundant, and novel electrocatalysts for HER such as semiconducting metal dichalcogenides with layered structure, e.g., MoS2 and WS2 [10–12], have been proposed [13]. Although various attempts have been made to improve their electrocatalytic activity for HER, it is still not satisfactory [14–18]. Recently, we have proposed theoretically that insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on electrocatalytically inert metal substrates could work as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [19–22] and proved experimentally that various forms of h-BN, i.e., BN nanotube (BNNT), BN nanosheet (BNNS) and sputter deposited BN, on gold substrate indeed act as electrocatalysts not only for ORR [23], but also for HER [24]. The fact that the highest activity for ORR at BN/Au electrodes was achieved by using BNNS [23], strong substrate dependencies [21,23,24], and theoretical evaluations [21,24] suggest that the interactions between BNNS and Au, particularly at the BNNS/Au interface, play an essential role for improved electrocatalytic activities for both ORR and HER. Attempts were made to increase the BNNS/Au interaction by decorating BNNS with Au nanoparticles and electrocatalytic activity for ORR at BNNS/Au was enhanced by the decoration [25]. To further increase the BNNS/Au interaction at the interface, smaller sized Au NPs were used for BNNS decoration. Not only higher ORR rate but also higher fraction of oxygen to H2O was achieved [26]. As the BNNS/Au interaction is also important for the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity for HER, here we examined the effect of Au NP decoration on HER rate at BNNS/Au electrode. We also attempted to decrease the amount of Au for decoration by incorporating other elements such as Ni, Cu, and Co to Au NP. To confirm the importance of BNNS, the HER rates at Au electrode modified by rGO decorated with Au and Au-Ni NPs were also examined."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Boron nitride (BN, ~99%, High Purity Chemicals, BBI03PB), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), HAuCl4 (99.9%), Nickel (or) Cu (or) Co acetylacetone, oleic acid, ultrapure reagent grade ethanol, hexane, H2SO4, HClO4 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. Oleylamine and borane-tert-butylamine complex were purchased from Aldrich. Water was purified by using Milli-Q system (Yamato, WQ-500, Japan)."
3,Preparation of BN Nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO),"2.2 Preparation of BN Nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) Size controlled BNNS (0.45–1.0 μm) was used in this study and was prepared by the method reported before [24]. Briefly, BN powder/isopropyl alcohol dispersion (3 mg/mL) was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 96 h. The dispersions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min after sonication and the 1/2 of supernatant was collected. Then, it was diluted by adding 3 times volume of IPA. The diluted BNNS dispersion was filtered by MF-Millipore filter (Merck Millipore, VSWP type) of 1 μm pore size. The filtrate was further filtered by a filter of 0.45 μm pore size. The BNNS residue on the 0.45 μm filter was collected as BNNS (0.45–1.0 μm). rGO was prepared by a modified Hummer's method [25,27]."
4,Decoration of BNNS and rGO with Au and Au-M NPs,"2.3 Decoration of BNNS and rGO with Au and Au-M NPs i. Preparation of small Au NPs of narrow size distribution: Small Au NPs of narrow size distribution were prepared as reported before [26]. Briefly, 20 mg of HAuCl4 was dissolved in a mixed solution of oleylamine (10 mL) and oleic acid (0.3 mL) under gentle Ar flow and magnetic stirring. The solution was heated to 90 °C to ensure HAuCl4 was completely dissolved. Then, 130.5 mg of borane-tert-butylamine complex was quickly injected in the solution. The mixed solution was then stirred for 2 h at 220 °C and was then cooled down to room temperature. The product was collected by centrifugation (8500 rpm, 10 min) after adding 40 mL of ethanol. The product was then dispersed in 20 mL hexane, precipitated out by adding 40 mL of ethanol and centrifugation, and re-dispersed in hexane [26]. ii. Preparation of small Au-M (M = Ni, Cu, and Co) NPs of narrow size distribution: Au-M NPs were prepared by the method similar to the one used for Au NP preparation. Under gentle Ar flow and magnetic stirring, 19.7 mg of HAuCl4·3H2O was dissolved with 38.5 mg of Ni(acac)2, Cu(acac)2, or Co(acac)2 in a mixed solution of oleylamine (10 mL) and oleic acid (0.3 mL). Following steps were exactly the same as those used for Au NP preparation as shown above [26]. iii. Decoration of BNNS with small Au and Au-M NPs of narrow size distribution: 10 mg of BNNS (0.45 μm–1 μm) was dispersed in 10 mL of IPA solution and sonicated for 3 h. 10 mg of as synthesized Au and Au-M NPs was dispersed in 25 mL of hexane and 25 μL of the Au NPs dispersion was added to the BNNS dispersion (10 mL) and sonicated for about 5 min. Similarly, decoration of rGO with Au and Au-M NPs was carried out. NPs should be adsorbed on BNNS at the defect sites and/or edges since theoretical calculation showed that strong interaction is expected between Au cluster and various defect sites and edges of BNNS [28] and many defects and edges are introduced during the preparation of BNNS from BN powder [21]."
5,Preparation of Au electrodes modified with Au and Au-M NP decorated BNNS,"2.4 Preparation of Au electrodes modified with Au and Au-M NP decorated BNNS Sputter deposited Au on Si substrate (1 cm × 1 cm) was used as working electrode. Au electrodes modified with Au and Au-M NP decorated BNNS were prepared as described before [26]. Briefly, BNNSs decorated with Au and Au-M NPs were then deposited on Au disk electrode (diameter: ~5 mm) by self-evaporation method. The Au disk electrode was perpendicularly placed in 2.5 mL of Au and Au-M NP decorated BNNS dispersion in a 4 mL beaker and was left until all the solution was evaporated at room temperature. Then the electrode was heated at 120 °C for about 2 h. Adsorbed NPs should be stabilize as the modified BNNS is placed on Au substrate as theoretical calculation showed [29]."
6,"XRD, TEM, and electrochemical measurements","2.5 XRD, TEM, and electrochemical measurements X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were carried out using RINT 2000 Ultima-III (Rigaku, Japan) with monochromatic Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and JEM-2100F (JEOL, Japan), respectively. For TEM measurements, 2 μL of dispersions of the bare and decorated BNNS were placed on a copper mesh grid and then the grid was left in air so that the solvent was evaporated. Electrochemical measurements were performed in rotating disk electrode (RDE) configuration. A potentiostat/function generator (Hokuto Denko, HSV-100) and a rotation speed control unit (Hokuto Denko, HR-202) were used to control the electrode potential and the rotation speed, respectively. Carbon paper and Ag/AgCl (sat. NaCl) electrodes were used as a counter and a reference electrode, respectively."

8,"Characterization of Au, Au-Ni, Au-Cu, and Au-Co NPs and BNNS decorated with Au and Au-Ni NPs","3.1 Characterization of Au, Au-Ni, Au-Cu, and Au-Co NPs and BNNS decorated with Au and Au-Ni NPs NPs and BNNS decorated with NPs were characterized by TEM and XRD. Details of TEM and HRTEM images of Au NPs and BNNS decorated with Au NPs were reported in our previous report [26]. Fig. 1 shows TEM images of the as-synthesized Au-Ni (a, b), Au-Cu (c, d), and Au-Co (e, f) NPs, respectively. TEM images of wide areas (a, c, e) show that all NPs have narrow size distribution ranging from 5 to 10 nm. Narrow range TEM images show that Au-Cu NPs are little larger than other NPs. XRD patterns of the as-synthesized Au and Au-Ni NPs (Fig. 2(a)) show the (111), (200), (220), (222) and (311) peaks of Au, the positions of which are in agreement with those of the reference data (JCPDS 04-0784) [30]. The diffraction difference between Au NP and AuNi NP in the 2 (range of 55–60 corresponds to the incorporation of Ni into Au [31]. Average sizes of the Au and Au-Ni NPs were determined by Scherrer equation [32] as 4.8 nm and 5.6 nm, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows TEM images of BNNS decorated with Au (i, ii) and Au-Ni (iii, iv) NPs. TEM images of wide areas (i, iii) show the narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 5 ± 0.8 nm, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. Higher resolution images (ii, iv) shows that both NPs are crystalline (likely to be a twin) and (111) and (100) phases of inter-lattice spacing of 0.24 and 0.21 nm, respectively, are exposed [27]. Incorporation of Ni, Cu, and Co in Au-Ni, Au-Cu, and Au-Co NPs, respectively, were confirmed by XPS."
9,HER activity,"3.2 HER activity 3.2.1 Electrochemical characteristics at Au electrode modified by BNNS decorated with Au, Au-Ni, Au-Cu, and Au-Co NPs Fig. 3(a) shows linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of Au electrodes with and without various modifications, i.e., Au, BNNS/Au, Au NP-BNNS/Au, Au-Ni NP-BNNS/Au, Au-Cu NP-BNNS/Au, Au-Co NP-BNNS/Au measured in Ar saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by scanning the potential negatively by 1 mV/s. Result at Pt electrode is also shown for comparison. Fig. 3(b) is Tafel plots for the results of Fig. 3(a) and Table 1 summarizes all the results. The current-potential (i-V) relation of Au electrode shifted positively by ca. 250 mV (at 5 mAcm−2)–300 mV (at 15 mA cm−2) by the BNNS modification as reported before [24]. The HER overpotential was further decreased by Au NP decoration as for ORR [25,26] by ca. 70 mV (at 5 mA cm)–90 mV (at 15 mA cm−2) and is only ca. 20 mV (at 5 mA cm−2)–40 mV (at 15 mA cm−2) larger than that at Pt electrode. These results support that BNNS edge atoms of certain positions in contact with Au are the active sites as reported before [24]. BNNS decorations by Au-Ni, Au-Cu, and Au-Co NPs are all effective to reduce the HER overpotential at the BNNS/Au electrode by 80 mV (at 5 mA cm−2)–110 mV (at 15 mA cm−2), 80 mV (at 5 mA cm−2)–100 mV (at 15 mA cm−2), and 65 mV (at 5 mA cm−2)–90 mV (at 15 mA cm−2), respectively, showing that Au-Ni and Au-Cu NPs decoration provide more but Au-Co NP provides less active electrode than Au NP decoration. The HER overpotential at Au-Ni-BNNS/Au is the smallest and is only 16 mV (at 5 mA cm−2)–30 mV (at 15 mA cm−2) larger than those at Pt electrode. Since the amounts and bonding states of foreign atoms, i.e., Ni, Cu, and Co, in NPs are not controlled and are not known, it is difficult to discuss why and how foreign atoms affect the HER activity [33]. These results, however, suggest the possibility of preparation of more highly active HER electrocatalyst with low Au content. Fig. 3(b) and Table 1 show that Tafel slope at Au electrode (75 mV/decade) was decreased by the BNNS modification to 40 mV/decade as reported before [24] but no further change was observed by Au and Au-M NP decorations. This is reasonable as active site for HER is the atoms of BNNS edges interacting with Au where adsorption energy of hydrogen is favoured for HER to proceed via Volmer-Tafel mechanism [24]. 3.2.2 Electrochemical characteristics at Au electrode modified by rGO decorated with Au and Au-Ni NPs To confirm the importance of BNNS support, the HER rates at Au electrode modified by rGO, the structure of which is similar to that of BNNS but is conductive, and by rGO decorated with Au NP and Au-Ni NPs were also examined. Fig. 3(c) shows the LSVs of Au electrodes modified by rGO, Au NP-rGO, and Au-Ni NP-rGO as well as of bare Pt electrodes measured in Ar saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by scanning the potential negatively by 1 mV/s. Fig. 3(d) is Tafel plots for the results of Fig. 3(b) and Table 1 summarizes all the results. The HER overpotential at Au electrode was reduced by rGO modification (rGO/Au electrode) by 40 mV at 15 mA cm−2 while it was reduced by BNNS modification by 300 mV at 15 mA cm−2, showing the electrocatalytic activity of rGO itself for HER is not so significant. The HER overpotential at rGO/Au electrode was further reduced by the decoration of rGO with Au NP and Au-Ni NP by 160 mV and 140 mV, respectively, proving that Au and Au-Ni NP-rGO combinations are also effective to enhance HER rate at Au electrode. The HER overpotentials at Au NP-rGO/Au and Au-Ni NP-rGO/Au electrodes are, however, larger than those at Au NP-BNNS/Au and Au-Ni NP-BNNS/Au electrodes, respectively, by ca. 80 mV, showing the crucial role of BNNS for the enhanced HER activity."
10,Conclusion,"We have demonstrated that HER rates at Au electrodes are significantly enhanced by the modification by BNNS decorated with Au, Au-Ni, Au-Cu, or Au-Co NPs. The highest efficiency was achieved at Au electrode modified by BNNS decorated with Au-Ni NPs where the HER overpotentials are only 15 mV (at 5 mA cm−2)–30 mV (at 15 mA cm−2) larger than those at Pt electrode. While exchange current density was increased by BNNS modification and further by Au and Au-M NPs decoration of BNNS, Tafel slope was decrease by the BNNS modification but not affected by the BNNS decoration by Au and Au-M NPs, showing that the decoration simply increases the number of active sites, i.e., the atoms of BNNS edges interacting with Au atoms. More detailed mechanistic studies with careful characterization of NPs and DFT calculations are under way."
