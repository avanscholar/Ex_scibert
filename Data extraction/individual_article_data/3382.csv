0,Introduction,"Reversible hydrogenation of Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) has been seen as an upcoming alternative to conventional hydrogen storage technologies [1–5]. In this technology, an aromatic compound can conserve hydrogen in a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The accumulating saturated compound can be stored for a long time. The hydrogen is reversibly released in a catalytic reaction and the aromatic starting compound is recovered and is ready for the new use [1]. Among the perspective storage materials, biphenyl and diphenylmethane have attracted considerable attention because they are not too expensive and have a reasonably high gravimetric hydrogen content, as well as sufficient compatibility with the existing gasoline infrastructure [6]. Biphenyl is industrially produced on the large scale (e.g. Therminol VP-1 Heat Transfer Fluid from Dow). Diphenyl methane is easily prepared by the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene with benzyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid. Among the specific requirements that are expected for an optimal LOHC, the low melting points and the low vapour pressures are always the prerequisites. The melting point of diphenylmethane is 25° and the melting point of biphenyl is 69 °C. However, the eutectic mixture of biphenyl (35 wt%) and diphenylmethane (65 wt%), became liquid already at 21 °C under 1 atm. This mixture is able to store 6.9 wt% of hydrogen via catalytic hydrogenation of over a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at 393 K under 50 bar of H2 [7]. The resulting hydrogenated mixtures of dicyclohexylmethane and bicyclohexane also released molecular hydrogen via catalytic dehydrogenation in the presence of a Pd-based catalyst with the conversion of 100% [8,9]. In recent years, fuel cells have drawn the attention of science and industry, because they generate useful energy with high efficiency using H2 and only water is generated as an emission. Hence, the development of fuel cell technology for both mobile and stationary power generation is motivated by the environmental aspect. A series of LOHC (cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, cyclohexene, 2-propanol, and cyclohexanol) were applied to the direct fuel cells [10]. The application of the eutectic mixture of biphenyl and diphenylmethane as a safe and economical hydrogen storage material in conjunction with a fuel cell has been demonstrated just recently [8]. While most of the previous studies focused mainly on the catalysis of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, only a limited number of thermodynamic studies have been published. The current study focuses on the equilibrium study and thermodynamic analysis of the biphenyl hydrogenation reactions. These results are indispensable for optimisation of fuel cell technologies based on LOHC. The thermodynamic data on diphenylmethane can be found in the literature [11,12]. Thermodynamic data on biphenyl we evaluated just recently [5]. Biphenyl derivatives involved in the thermodynamic analysis in this work are shown in Fig. 1 . The thermochemical information available on pure phenyl-cyclohexane and bicyclohexane has been collected from the literature and carefully evaluated in this work with the help of the complementary experimental and computational methods. The only previous chemical equilibrium study of the biphenyl hydrogenation was reported by Frye [13], however, the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants shows a large spread of experimental points leading to very uncertain reaction enthalpies. In this work, the chemical equilibrium of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of the biphenyl and its derivatives (see Fig. 2 ) was studied in a broad temperature range from 553 K to 648 K. The experimental enthalpies of reactions R-I to R-IV have been validated with thermochemical data on pure reactions participants, as well as with the help of the high-level quantum chemical calculations."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Samples of phenyl-cyclohexane, cis-1-phenyl-cyclohexene, bicyclohexane were of commercial origin (see Table S1) with purities of 0.97 to 0.99 mass fraction as given in the specification. Prior to the experiment, the samples were purified using fractional vacuum distillation. Purities were determined using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column HP-5 (stationary phase crosslinked 5% PH ME silicone, column length of 30 m, inside diameter of 0.32 mm, film thickness of 0.25 μm). The analysis was performed with the temperature program T = 353 K for 30 s followed by a heating rate of 0.167 K·s−1 to T = 523 K. No contamination (greater than the mass fraction 0.0009) could be detected in the samples used for the thermochemical measurements."
3,Chemical equilibrium study,"2.2 Chemical equilibrium study The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation experiments with biphenyl and phenyl-cyclohexane were carried out in an autoclave R201 (Korea, alloy Hastelloy C-276) with a volume of 300 mL. In a typical experiment, about 2 percent by weight of the substrate was dissolved in n-heptane. A known amount of solution was loaded into the autoclave. Before the experiment, the autoclave was sealed and flushed with hydrogen. To vary the substrate: hydrogen ratio, the reactor was evacuated and pressurized with hydrogen to a selected initial pressure. Catalytic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of biphenyl and phenyl-cyclohexane was carried out on the silica supported Ni, Pt, or Pd catalysts in the temperature range from 553 K to 648 K, in the pressure range from 2.7 MPa to 9.8 MPa, and with the molar ratio H2: substrate from 0.45 to 6.2. Sampling from the reactor was continued until no further change of the compositions was observed (see Fig. S1). The achievement of the true chemical equilibrium was in different test series with the wide variation of the molar ratio H2: substrate and the amount of catalyst in the reaction mixture. Reaction mixture identification was performed with gas-chromatograph Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra equipped with a capillary column Zebron ZB-1 100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.50 µm (100% Dimethylpolysiloxane). Reaction mixtures were analyzed by gas-chromatography. A Zebron ZB-35 capillary column 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm (35% phenyl and 65% dimethylpolysiloxane) was used. The samples taken from the reactor during equilibration were filtered off from the catalyst and injected directly to determine the composition of the reaction mixture."
4,Transpiration method: Vapour pressure measurements,"2.3 Transpiration method: Vapour pressure measurements Vapour pressures of biphenyl derivatives were determined using the transpiration method [14–17]. A tubular saturator was filled with the sample mixed with small glass beads to provide sufficient surface area for vapour-liquid equilibrium and to avoid a pressure drop along the saturator. At a series of constant temperatures (±0.1 K), a stream of nitrogen was passed through the saturator and the amount of material transported was collected in a cold trap (kept at 273 K). The volume of the carrier gas V N2 was determined by the digital flow rate sensor from integration with a microcontroller. We used the Honeywell S&C - HAFBLF0200C2AX5 digital flow rate sensor with uncertainty at the level of 2.5%. The flow rate of the nitrogen stream was also controlled by using a soap bubble flow meter and optimized in order to reach the saturation equilibrium of the transporting gas at each temperature under study. The volume of the carrier gas VN2 was read from the calibrated digital flow rate sensor. The saturation vapour pressure pi at each temperature T i was calculated from the amount of material collected in the cold trap within a certain period of time. The amount of material transported was determined by GC analysis using an external standard (we used pure hydrocarbons n-CnH2n+2). Assuming the validity of the Dalton‘s law applied to the nitrogen stream saturated with the substance i, the values of p i were calculated using the equation: (1) p i = m i · R · T a / V · M i ; V = V N 2 + V i ; ( V N 2 » V i ) where R = 8.3144598 J·K−1·mol−1 is the ideal gas constant; mi is the mass of the transported compound, Mi is the molar mass of the compound, and Vi is its volume contribution to the gaseous phase. V N2 is the volume of the carrier gas and T a is the temperature of the devices used for measurement of the gas flow."
5,Quantum-chemical calculations,"2.4 Quantum-chemical calculations Theoretical values of the gas-phase enthalpies of formation of biphenyl and its derivatives were calculated by using quantum-chemical calculations. We used the composite G4 method [18] available in the Gaussian 09 software package [19] for calculations of enthalpies H 298 which were finally converted to the Δ f H m o (g)-values and discussed. For quantum-chemical calculations, we used the most stable conformer of each compound. The well-established assumption “rigid rotator-harmonic oscillator” was used for the quantum-chemical calculations."
6,Results,
7,Chemical equilibrium studies of hydrogenation reactions,"3.1 Chemical equilibrium studies of hydrogenation reactions Chemical equilibrium was studied in the supercritical fluid phase (SCF) and gas-phase (Gas). Special experiments were performed (the experimental method is described in details elsewhere [20]) to determine the phase (liquid–vapour) diagram for a mixture modeling the hydrogenation reaction conditions. It has turned out, that the phase state of the system is determined by the properties of the solvent, and hydrogen and reacting hydrocarbons have a negligible effect due to their small amount. Thus, the phase state of the reacting system during the experiment was controlled predominantly by the phase diagram of the solvent. For the supercritical fluid area, the temperature, pressure, and density of the reaction mass under experimental conditions were greater than the critical temperature, pressure, and density. For the gas-phase area, the temperature and pressure were greater than the critical temperature and pressure, and the density was less than the critical density. The experimental equilibrium constant was calculated by the following general equation [13]: (2) K a = x rp x in ∙ ( 1 + 3.3 ∙ 10 - 4 ∙ P H 2 ) ν H 2 ∙ P H 2 ν H 2 where x in , x rp are the molar fractions of the initial substrate and the reaction product, respectively; P H 2 is partial pressure of hydrogen in atm; ν H 2 is the stoichiometric coefficient for hydrogen. The deviation of the system from ideality was taken into account by the equation ( 1 + 3.3 ∙ 10 - 4 ∙ P H 2 ) [13]. It should be noted that the non-ideality correction used in this manuscript was derived in [13] for solvent-free reactions, when the major component was H2. This probably explains the difference in the equilibrium constants in the gas and supercritical states (Table 1 ), since that correction was not designed for the case when large amounts of inert solvents are present. When calculating the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, the non-ideality of the system must be considered, taking into account all components of the reaction mixture (including the solvent). This is usually done using any equation of state. However, the use of equations of state requires reliable data on the critical properties of substances (T c, P c, V c) and the normal boiling point (T b). Unfortunately, such data are not available for phenyl-cyclohexane and bicyclohexane. Using predicting methods to obtain the missing information would lead to unpredictable errors in determining the activities. Therefore, the following assumptions were made when calculating the equilibrium constants. 1st assumption. The activity is equal to the product of the activity coefficient and the partial pressure of the component: (3) a i = γ i ∙ P i Then, for the R-I reaction, the equilibrium constant is: (4) K a = K γ ∙ K p = γ p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e γ b i p h e n y l ∙ γ H 2 3 ∙ P p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e P b i p h e n y l ∙ P H 2 3 2nd assumption. The partial pressure of a component is equal to the product of the total pressure in the system and the molar fraction of this component: (5) P i = x i ∙ P total Then, for the R-II reaction, the equilibrium constant is: (6) K a = K γ ∙ K p = γ p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e γ b i p h e n y l ∙ γ H 2 3 ∙ x p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e ∙ P total x b i p h e n y l ∙ P total ∙ x H 2 3 ∙ P total 3 3d assumption. Due to the fact that the total content of biphenyl, phenyl-cyclohexane and bicyclohexane in the reaction mass is less than 1.5% mol, the system can be considered highly diluted, therefore: (7) γ p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e γ b i p h e n y l ≈ γ b i c y c l o h e x a n e γ p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e ≈ γ b i c y c l o h e x a n e γ b i p h e n y l ≈ 1 and γ H 2 = 1 + 3.3 ∙ 10 - 4 ∙ P H 2 After performing all the necessary transformations, we obtain equation for calculating the equilibrium constant of the reaction R-I: (8) K a = K γ ∙ K p = 1 1 + 3.3 ∙ 10 - 4 ∙ P H 2 3 ∙ x p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e x b i p h e n y l ∙ x H 2 3 ∙ P total 3 For the R-II and R-III reactions, the equation for the constant is derived in the same way. The gas-phase equilibrium constant for the reaction R-IV was calculated according to equation: (9) K a = x p h e n y l - c y c l o h e x a n e 2 x b i p h e n y l ∙ x b i c y c l o h e x a n e The consistency of the obtained thermal effects of reactions from the chemical equilibrium and calorimetry data, as well as further confirmed by quantum chemical calculations, allowed us to use all these assumptions. Equilibrium constants measured in this work for reactions R-I to R-IV at different temperatures are given in Table 1 and presented graphically in Figs. 3–6 ."
8,Thermodynamics of vaporization of biphenyl derivatives,"3.2 Thermodynamics of vaporization of biphenyl derivatives 3.2.1 Absolute vapour pressures The experimental vapour pressures pi measured for the biphenyl derivatives (see Table 2 ) at different temperatures were measured with the help of the transpiration method. They were fitted with the following equation [14,15]: (10) R ln ( p i / p ref ) = a + b T + Δ l g C p , m o l n T T 0 where Δ l g C p , m o is the difference of the molar heat capacities of the gas and liquid phases respectively (see Table 3 ), a and b are adjustable parameters, R = 8.31446 J.K−1.mol−1 is the molar gas constant, and the reference pressure p ref = 1 Pa. The temperature T 0 appearing in Eq. (10) is generally an arbitrarily chosen reference temperature. In this work, it was chosen to be T 0 = 298.15 K. The first vapour pressures on phenyl-cyclohexane were reported by Stull [21], who compiled thermodynamic data for the Dow Company, which were available till 1947. The data in this compilation are presented as smoothed vapour pressures at certain pressures from 5 mmHg to 760 mmHg. The sources of the primary data compiled are not well documented or not available in this century. This may be one reason why the data from Stull [21] differ considerably from the more recent vapour pressure studies [22–26], as can be seen in Fig. 7 . Our new transpiration vapour pressures for the phenyl-cyclohexane agree very well with the results of Kasehgari et al. [24], measured with the static method in a comparable temperature range (see Fig. 7). Vapour pressures available in the temperature range up to the boiling point seem to be in agreement with the data from the low-temperature range (see Fig. 7). Vapour pressures for the 1-phenyl-cyclohexene have been measured for the first time (see Table 2). Available vapour pressures for the bicyclohexane are compared in Fig. 8 . The very accurate measurements on this compound measured by Wieczorek and Kobayashi [27] the static method are not directly comparable with our new results due to significantly different temperature intervals. Our new vapour pressures in agreement (see Fig. 8) with the ebulliometric vapour pressures reported by Myers and Fenske [36]. Ruby and Loveland [35] reported bicyclohexane vapour pressures using static (isoteniscope) methods between 283 K and 333 K. Even today, the exact vapour pressure measurements below 10 Pa are a challenging task, especially for the isoteniscope method. As can be seen from Fig. 8, their vapour pressures are only comparable with the latest results in the range above 10 Pa. 3.2.2 Vaporization enthalpies and entropies Vapour pressure measured at different temperatures, T, in this work, as well as those available from the literature have been used to derive the standard molar enthalpies of vaporization of biphenyl derivatives using the following equation: (11) Δ l g H m o T = - b + Δ l g C p , m o × T Vaporization entropies at temperatures T were also derived from the vapour pressures temperature dependences using Eq. (12): (12) Δ l g S m o T = Δ l g H m o / T + R l n p i / p r e f Experimental vapour pressures measured at different temperatures by the transpiration method, coefficients a and b of Eq. (10), as well as values of Δ l g H m o (T) and Δ l g S m o (T) are given in Table 2. The method for calculating the combined uncertainties of the vaporization enthalpies includes uncertainties from the experimental conditions of transpiration, uncertainties in vapour pressure and uncertainties due to the temperature adjustment to T = 298.15 K as described elsewhere [16,17]. 3.2.3 Temperature adjustments of vaporization enthalpies As a rule, thermochemical calculations are commonly performed at the reference temperature T = 298.15 K in order to compare or reveal structure–property relationships. The vaporization enthalpies at the reference temperature, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), were calculated according to the Kirchhoff́s equation: Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) = Δ l g H m o T av + Δ C p,m o ×( T av – 298.15 K) (13) The value Δ l g C p, m o = C p, m o (g) – C p, m o (liq) is the difference between the molar heat capacities of the gaseous C p, m o (g) and the liquid phase C p, m o (liq), respectively. Data required for the temperature adjustments of vaporization enthalpies are given in Table 3. The final experimental vaporization enthalpies at T = 298.15 K derived from the transpiration method are listed in Table 4 , column 5. For comparison, the compilation of the standard molar vaporization enthalpies for the biphenyl derivatives available from the literature is also given in Table 4. The literature data have been approximated by using Eqs. (3–5) in the same way as our own results. The combined uncertainties of the literature data have been also re-assessed as described elsewhere [16,17]. (13) R × ln p i / p o = - Δ l g G m ° θ θ + Δ l g H m ° θ 1 θ - 1 T - Δ l g C p , m ° θ θ T - 1 + ln T θ where p i is the vapour pressure at the temperature T, p o is an arbitrary reference pressure (p o = 1 Pa in this work), θ is an arbitrary reference temperature (in this work we use θ = 298.15 K), R is the molar gas constant, Δ l g G m o θ is the difference in the standard molar Gibbs energy between the gaseous and the liquid phases, Δ l g H m o θ is the difference in the standard molar enthalpy between the gas and the liquid phases, and Δ l g C p , m o θ is the difference in the molar heat capacity at constant pressure between the gaseous and the liquid phase. We have found five data sets of vapour pressures for 1-phenyl-cyclohexane. These data were uniformly approximated by Eq. 10 with the value of Δ l g C p,m o from Table 3 and the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values are listed in Table 4 for comparison with results derived in this work. As can be seen from this table the vaporization enthalpies derived indirectly from vapour pressure temperature dependences [22–26] are in very good agreement with our new measurements. Moreover, these results also agree well with those measured directly at 298.15 K by vaporization calorimetry [33]. Also the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-value obtained from an independent method based on the solution enthalpies measured by the high-precision solution calorimetry is in excellent agreement with vaporization enthalpies derived from different conventional methods. In order to obtain more confidence, we have averaged all nine entries for phenyl-cyclohexane in Table 4 and derived the value Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) = 59.8 ± 0.3 kJ·mol−1 which is recommended for the thermochemical calculations. Vapour pressures temperature dependence of 1-phenyl-cyclohexene have been measured for the first time. Vapour pressures for bicyclohexane discussed in the previous chapter seem to be consistent in the broad temperature range (see Fig. 8). However, the vaporization enthalpies Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) measured directly by calorimetry [33] are slightly below (but within the experimental uncertainties) the results indirectly derived from the vapour pressure temperature dependences [27,36 this work]. In order to obtain more confidence, we have averaged six entries for bicyclohexane given in Table 4 and derived the value Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) = 59.4 ± 0.3 kJ·mol−1 which is recommended for the thermochemical calculations. 3.2.4 Validation of experimental vaporization enthalpies with help of the Kovatśs retention indices The dissimilarity between the direct and indirect experimental vaporization enthalpies Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) for bicyclohexane has prompted the use of a correlation gas-chromatographic (CGC) method [3,37,38] to validate our new transpiration results. The CGC is the valuable method to establish the consistency of the results by correlating the experimental Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values with their gas-chromatographic Kovats’s indices [39] (see details in the electronic supporting information). The literature data available on the Kovatśs retention indices, J x, for cyclic hydrocarbons and biphenyl derivatives were taken for correlation with vapourisation enthalpies measured in this work (see Table 5 ). It is known, that the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values correlate linearly with Kovats’s indices in various homologous series of alkylbenzenes, alkanes, aliphatic ethers, alcohols, or in a series of structurally similar compounds [42]. As expected, the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K)-values correlated linearly with Jx values for a selected set of structurally similar compounds. For the set of Kovatśs indices for cyclohexane derivatives (see Table 5), the following linear correlation was obtained: (14) Δ l g H m o 298.15 K k J · m o l - 1 = 6.73 + 0.0403 × J x w i t h ( R 2 = 0.9999 ) The results for phenyl-cyclohexane, phenyl-cyclohexene and bicyclohexane obtained from the correlations with Kovatśs indices are in a very good agreement with those of the transpiration method (see Table 5). Such good agreement can be seen as additional validation of the experimental data measured in this work by using the transpiration method (see Table 2). It can be seen from Table 5, that differences between experimental and calculated according to Eq. (14) values are mostly below 0.2 kJ·mol−1. Hence, the uncertainties of vaporization enthalpies values estimated from the Δ l g H m o (298.15 K) − Jx correlation are assessed to be ±0.5 kJ·mol−1."
9,Discussion,
10,Experimental reaction enthalpies from the equilibrium study,"4.1 Experimental reaction enthalpies from the equilibrium study The temperature dependences of the equilibrium constant of reactions R-I to R-IV listed in Table 1 have been used to derive thermodynamic properties for these reactions (see Table 6 ) according to Eq. (15). (15) ln K p T = a + b ∙ 1000 T w i t h a = Δ r S m o ( T ) R ; b = - Δ r H m o ( T ) R where R = 8.31446 J.K−1.mol−1 is the molar gas constant; K p – is the equilibrium constant in the gas phase; T is the temperature, in К; Δ r H m o (T) is the reaction enthalpy, in kJ⋅mol−1; Δ r S m o (T) is the entropy change of reaction, in J⋅K−1⋅mol−1. In this work, the equilibrium study of hydrogenation reactions was performed in the supercritical fluid, as well as in the gas phase. As can be seen from Figs. 3–6, the equilibrium constants for both types of studies are different, but slopes of the temperature dependences the equilibrium constants for each type of reaction (that are responsible for the reaction enthalpy) are very close. As consequence, the Δ r H m o (g)-values from the “SCF” and “Gas” methods for each reaction R-1, R-II, or R-III are indistinguishable, within the boundaries of experimental uncertainties (see Table 6). It is interesting to compare our new results with those reported by Frye [13]. The experiments by Frye [13] were performed in a cylindrical stainless steel reactor connected to a pressure gauge. After loading with feed and catalyst, the reactor was evacuated and pressured with hydrogen to a selected initial pressure. Then it was heated and held at the desired temperature until the pressure reached a constant value. The time at constant temperature varied from about 30 min to about 70 h depending upon temperature. Finally, the entire equilibrium product was rapidly withdrawn and analyzed by a gas chromatograph. From this description, the experimental conditions that Frye used to study the hydrogenation reactions R-I and R-III are quite similar to those in our work for the “Gas” method. However, the equilibrium constants by Frye are slightly but systematically lower in comparison to our results (see Figs. 3 and 5). May be these differences could be attributed to the calibration of the chromatographic method, as well as to the inaccuracy of the temperature measurements in the reactor by Frye. Nevertheless, the reaction enthalpies derived from the equilibrium constants reported by Frye [13] are generally in agreement with our new data, taking into account the large uncertainties calculated for his values. The equilibrium study of reaction R-IV was essential to establish the general consistency of experimental reaction enthalpies. From a theoretical point of view this reaction is expected to be thermoneutral. Indeed, both thermochemical (TC) and G4 calculations support this expectation within the assigned uncertainties. Also the Δ r H m o (T)-values from the “SCF” and “Gas” methods for reaction R-IV are close to zero within the experimental uncertainties. It is apparent from Table 6, that the Δ r H m o (T)-values for the reactions R-I to R-IV are referenced to the average temperatures of the equilibrium studies, which are above 600 K. From the point of view of hydrogen storage, it is important to assess how different these reaction enthalpies are from the reaction enthalpies calculated according to Hesśs Law from the thermochemical data ascribed to the reference temperature T = 298.15 K. To answer this question, we need to collect reliable data on Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) for biphenyl, phenyl-cyclohexane, and bicyclohexane, as the main participants of reactions R-I to R-IV. The evaluation of these required data is described in the following chapters."
11,Hydrogenation reaction enthalpies derived from the thermochemical data,"4.2 Hydrogenation reaction enthalpies derived from the thermochemical data 4.2.1 Liquid-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation The gas-phase standard molar enthalpy of formation, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K), is generally composed from two contributions: (16) Δ f H m o ( g , 298.15 K ) = Δ l g H m o ( 298.15 K ) + Δ f H m o ( l i q , 298.15 K ) The standard molar enthalpies of vaporization, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), for the biphenyl derivatives are already evaluated in Table 4. The liquid phase standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K), for phenyl-cyclohexane and bicyclohexane available in the literature are in Table 7 and evaluated as follows. Phenyl-cyclohexane. Combustion enthalpies for phenyl-cyclohexane were reported in the literature twice [33,43]. The standard molar enthalpies of combustion (liq) and the standard molar enthalpies of formation Δ f H m o (liq) are referenced to the reaction: (17) C 12 H 16 ( l i q ) + 16 × O 2 ( g ) = 12 × C O 2 ( g ) + 8 · H 2 O ( l i q ) The Δ f H m o (liq)-value was obtained (see Table 7) applying the Hesśs Law to Eq. (17) with the help of recommended by CODATA [44] standard molar enthalpies of formation of H2O(liq) and CO2(g). In this work, we have re-calculated the original uncertainties related to combustion experiments according to the guidelines developed by Olofsson [45]. The uncertainty of the molar enthalpy of combustion and of the molar enthalpy of formation given in Table 7 is twice the overall standard deviation. The uncertainty of the molar enthalpy of combustion includes the uncertainties from calibration and from the combustion energies of the auxiliary materials. The uncertainties of the enthalpies of formation additionally include uncertainties of the reaction products H2O and CO2 [44]. The uncertainties are presented as expanded uncertainty with 0.95 level of confidence. In our opinion, both calorimetric studies of phenyl-cyclohexane are of high quality. Samples under study were carefully purified: purity 0.9993 mol fraction by Good [43] and purity 0.9996 mol fraction by Montgomery et al. [33]. The Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K)-values derived in both studies are in agreement within the limits of their experimental uncertainties (see Table 7). In addition, we used the experimental reaction enthalpy of reaction R-I from Table 6, and calculated the liquid phase enthalpy of formation of phenyl-cyclohexane by using the Hesśs Law. The value Δ f H m o (liq) = (82.1 ± 4.0) kJ·mol−1 (see Table 7) agrees well with the direct calorimetric results. Bicyclohexane. Combustion enthalpies for bicyclohexane were reported in the literature five times [33,43,46–48]. The standard molar enthalpies of combustion (liq) and the standard molar enthalpies of formation Δ f H m o (liq) are referenced to the reaction: (18) C 12 H 22 ( l i q ) + 17.5 × O 2 ( g ) = 12 × C O 2 ( g ) + 11 · H 2 O ( l i q ) In this work, we have re-calculated the original uncertainties related to combustion experiments according to the guidelines developed by Olofsson [44]. The details are essentially the same as described above for phenyl-cyclohexane. The original papers by Brull [46] and Wise et al. [47] were not available to us and we took the enthalpies of combustion (liq) from the NIST Webbook [49]. In the paper by Gollis et al. [48] the net enthalpies of combustion were obtained with a Parr Oxygen Bomb Calorimeter according to A.S.T.M. D240-57T. The purity of the sample was derived by vapour phase chromatography and infrared and ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The net calorific value reported by Gollis et al. [48] and we derived the enthalpy of combustion (see Table 7) by subtracting the enthalpy of vaporization of the water from the higher heating value. Except for the result by Brull [46], the Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K)-values derived from four studies are in fair agreement taking into account the limits of their experimental uncertainties (see Table 7). We also used the experimental reaction enthalpy of reaction R-III from Table 6, and calculated the liquid phase enthalpy of formation of bicyclohexane by using the Hesśs Law. The value Δ f H m o (liq) = -280.4 ± 7.9 kJ·mol−1 (see Table 7) agrees with those from the calorimetric studies. Biphenyl. Benchmark properties of biphenyl as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier have been evaluated with complementary experimental and computational methods just recently [5]. Thermochemical data relevant to this study are collected in Table 7. 4.2.2 Gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation: Validation with help of structure–property relationships Having evaluated the liquid-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (liq, 298.15 K) in Table 7, and the standard molar enthalpies of vaporization, Δ l g H m o (298.15 K), in Table 4, we can derive the experimental gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation, Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)exp for the biphenyl derivatives according to Eq. (16) (see Table 7, column 5). These re-evaluated values of experimental enthalpies of formation are undoubtedly important for the optimization of hydrogen storage technologies. However, from a scientific point of view, it is interesting to use these new data to trace the structure–property relationships in biphenyl derivatives and to gain a deeper insight into the energetics of structurally similar cyclic molecules. Moreover, the structure–property relationships help to assess the energetics of molecules that have not yet been investigated experimentally. Let us consider two series of cyclic compounds shown in Fig. 9 . The experimental data for the methyl-substituted cyclohexane derivatives are well established [50,51], and they can be used for comparison with the similarly shaped phenyl-substituted cyclohexane derivatives. As expected, the virtual dehydrogenation reactions of methyl-cyclohexane and phenyl-cyclohexane (see Fig. 9) show comparable reaction enthalpies (the numerical values are above the blue arrows). This similarity suggests that the isomerization enthalpy of 1-phenyl-cyclohexene to 4-phenyl-cyclohexene is also comparable to the isomerization enthalpy of 1-methyl-cyclohexene to 4-methyl-cyclohexene. The latter value Δ r H m o (g) = 5.8 ± 0.3 kJ·mol−1 (see Fig. 9) is well known from the equilibrium study [51]. Consequently, the unknown gas-phase enthalpy of formation of 4-phenyl-cyclohexene can be derived from 1-phenyl-cyclohexene as it shown in Fig. 9: Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) = 89.4 + 5.8 = (95.2 ± 1.8) kJ·mol−1 (see Table 7). The gas-phase enthalpy of formation of 1-phenyl-cyclohexene Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) = (89.4 ± 1.8) kJ·mol−1 (see Fig. 10 ) used for calculation of the gas-phase enthalpy of formation of 4-phenyl-cyclohexene was derived according to the Hesś s Law with help of enthalpy of formation of phenyl-cyclohexane evaluated in this work (see Table 7) and the experimental reaction enthalpy Δ r H m o (g) = −(107.9 ± 0.8) kJ·mol−1 (see Fig. 10) measured by the hydrogenation calorimetry [52]. The structure of 1-phenyl-cyclohexene investigated in this work (see Tables 2 and 4) and those studied by the hydrogenation calorimetry [52] is assigned as the cis-1-phenyl-cyclohexene as the most stable isomer in comparison to the trans-1-phenyl-cyclohexene. The cis/trans enthalpy of formation difference of 1-phenyl-cyclohexene, was measured in solution by photoacoustic calorimetry [53]. The experimental reaction enthalpy Δ r H m o (g) = (196.6 ± 12.6) kJ·mol−1 (see Fig. 11 ). This experimental result allows for estimation of Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K) = (286 ± 13) kJ·mol−1 (see Table 7) for the thermodynamically less stable trans-isomer of 1-phenyl-cyclohexene. Obviously, the trans-isomer is a highly strained molecule and the gas-phase enthalpy of formation can be useful, e.g. for testing of the high-level quantum-chemical calculations. 4.2.3 Gas-phase standard molar enthalpies of formation: Experiment and theory In this work, we used the high-level quantum-chemical calculations to support the reliability of our new experimental results. In the past decade, the high-level composite quantum-chemical methods become a valuable tool for obtaining theoretical Δ f H m o (g, 298.15)-values with so-called “chemical accuracy” of (4 to 5) kJ·mol−1 [54,55]. In this work we used the G4 methods to get the theoretical Δ f H m o (g, 298.15)-values of biphenyl, phenyl-cyclohexane, and bicyclohexane for validation of our new experimental results. An agreement or disagreement between the theoretical and experimental Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values provides a valuable indicator of mutual consistency. Conformational analysis and optimization of structures of biphenyl, phenyl-cyclohexane and bicyclohexane were performed by using the force field method MM3 [56] and the B3LYP/6–31 g(d,p) method [57]. Enthalpies H 298 of the most stable conformers for each isomer (see Fig. 12 ) were calculated by using the G4 method. The H 298-values calculated by the G4 (see Table S3) have been converted to the standard molar enthalpies of formation Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)theor using the atomization (AT) reaction. Based on our experience with the quantum chemical calculations, the enthalpies of formation from the atomization reaction sometimes systematically deviate from the experimental values [58]. However, a simple linear correlation could be found between experimental and calculated by atomisation enthalpies of formation of biphenyl, phenyl-cyclohexane, and bicyclohexane: (19) Δ f H m o ( g ) t h e o r / k J . m o l - 1 = 1.0046 × Δ f H m o ( g , A T ) + 3.6 w i t h R 2 = 0.9999 Using this correlation, the “corrected” enthalpies of formation of these compounds have been calculated (see Table 8 ) and these values are now in very good agreement with the experimental results. The good agreement observed among the theoretical and experimental Δ f H m o (g, 298.15 K)-values for biphenyl derivatives can be considered as an evidence of the internal consistency of thermochemical results evaluated un this work (see Table 7), which can be recommended now as reliable benchmark properties for further thermochemical calculations of hydrogenation reactions. For example, we can now answer the question asked at the end of Section 4.1. Indeed, the reaction enthalpies Δ r H m o (T)-values derived for reactions R-I to R-IV are referenced to temperatures well above 600 K. These conditions correspond to the temperature range of LOHC practical applications. However, the experimental equilibrium studies as carried out in this work are demanding and time-consuming. Nevertheless, as it can be seen from Table 6, the comparison of reaction enthalpies Δ r H m o (T≈600 K) derived in this work with those calculated according to the Hesśs Law from the thermochemical data evaluated in Table 7 at the reference temperature T = 298.15 K, provides a very important conclusion that the thermochemical data available at T = 298.15 K can be reliably used for the assessment of hydrogenation reactions energetics at elevated temperatures, without sophisticated corrections for heat capacity differences as required by Kirchhoff’s equation."
12,Thermodynamics of hydrogen release and uptake,"4.3 Thermodynamics of hydrogen release and uptake The reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reaction of biphenyl is given by the reaction: (20) C 12 H 10 ( l i q ) + 6 H 2 ( g ) = C 12 H 22 ( l i q ) The experimental reaction enthalpy, Δ r H m o = (-400.7 ± 7.8) kJ·mol−1, was derived from the equilibrium study, conducted in this work (see Table 6). For practical applications, values of the reaction enthalpies, which are calculated per mole of released hydrogen, are more important (see Table 9 ). Complete hydrogenation of biphenyl is accompanied by a heat release of Δ r H m o = –66.9 kJ mol−1/H2 (see Table 9). Note: all reaction enthalpies in Table 9 are reported relative to 1 mol hydrogen, not 1 mol of the substrate. For comparison, reaction enthalpies for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of benzene and alkylbenzenes are generally at the level of −67 kJ·mol−1/H2 (see Table 9). However, the biphenyl has significantly lower vapour pressures at ambient temperatures in comparison to the volatile alkylbenzenes. Hence, the LOHC based on biphenyl as the main component with the addition of aromatic compounds that lower its melting point is considered the best candidate, which is favourable in terms of thermodynamics, availability and cost."
13,Conclusions,"Equilibrium studies of biphenyl hydrogenation reactions were conducted. The consistent set of vapour pressures and standard molar thermodynamic properties of biphenyl derivatives was evaluated in this work with the help of complementary vapour pressure measurements, and empirical and quantum-chemical calculations. Thermodynamic properties of biphenyl derivatives are recommended as reliable benchmark properties for thermochemical calculations of the energetics of hydrogen storage. The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reaction enthalpy of biphenyl was calculated and compared with the data for other potential liquid organic hydrogen carriers. Due to the high hydrogen storage capacity, as well as very low volatility, mixtures with biphenyl could be considered as seminal candidates for LOHC."
