0,Introduction,
1,Current status,"1.1 Current status There is growing global attention on climate change and air pollution as evidenced by the formal ratification of the Paris Agreement in the 21st Conference of Parties in 2015. The agreement had the ultimate goal of keeping the mean global surface temperature increase to 1.5–2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100, increasing global and local focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1]. This raises the need for green fuels and low-carbon energy systems, given that the energy sector is the dominant contributor to a country’s GHG emissions. The energy sector predominantly uses fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil, and natural gas as primary resources to deliver power to many aspects of human life. In 2018, the global primary use of fossil fuels amounted to around 11.7 billion tons of oil equivalent [2]. This equated to 81% of total energy globally. Currently, coal and natural gas are used mainly in generating electricity, while crude oil is refined predominantly for the transport sector. The burning of fossil fuels contributes greatly to increasing carbon in the atmosphere and exacerbates climate change. Renewable energy such as solar, wind, hydro, tidal, geothermal, and biofuels generated 14% of the total energy mix in 2018 [2]. Solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind energy are sustainable sources of energy but are highly variable and intermittent. These sources of energy lack the reliability required for power generation. Hydrogen is identified as a key pathway for deep decarbonization for the energy and transport sectors in various countries [3]. A versatile energy vector that can be generated from various renewable (biomass and water) and non-renewable (natural gas, coal, and hydrocarbons) sources, Hydrogen has better efficiency than gasoline in terms of energy-to-movement conversion [4]. In addition to better efficiency, the emissions of air pollutants from hydrogen are reduced compared to traditional fossil fuels. To fully deploy hydrogen in the energy sector, many challenges need to be addressed. In the present state of hydrogen technologies, the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure is remarkably expensive, or otherwise excessively complicated [5]. Storage, handling, transport, and generation of hydrogen is problematic, especially when compared to the logistics of conventional liquid fuels. The volume and weight of hydrogen storage systems are currently still too high so it detrimentally affects vehicle range and all other storage technologies have low energy efficiencies. Life-cycle efficiency for chemical hydrides is affected due to by-product regeneration off-board. There is also a large energy requirement for compression and liquefaction for physical storage [6]. These challenges indicate a demand for a hydrogen carrier that can easily be handled using the current oil/gas infrastructure, as well as technologies to efficiently and economically generate hydrogen from this fuel. In this specific regard, methanol as a hydrogen-carrier is a great candidate to address these requirements. Methanol has a high H/C ratio of 4:1, is liquid at room temperature, and can be converted to hydrogen at lower temperatures relative to most fuels [7]. Fig. 1 summarizes the four different thermochemical processes, including methanol steam reforming (MSR), partial oxidation of methanol (POM), autothermal reforming of methanol (ATRM), and methanol decomposition (MD) that can utilize methanol to produce hydrogen."
2,Previous reviews,"1.2 Previous reviews Interest in methanol as a fuel for hydrogen production has been growing in the past two decades. Fig. 2 shows a publication search in Scopus using the keywords “methanol” and “hydrogen production”. The growing interest mirrors fuel cell research that utilizes high purity hydrogen. Palo et al. [7] reviewed methanol steam reforming (MSR) for hydrogen production and discussed various developments in MSR catalysts, reactors and system development, and the specific advantages and disadvantages of methanol as a hydrogen vector. They suggested that methanol’s simplicity would prove advantageous on the low power side (100–1000 W) as a pre-packaged consumable for reformed methanol fuel cells (RMFC), but would still be disadvantageous in terms of total reformed hydrogen production. Sa et al. [9] reviewed catalysts for methanol steam reforming and summarized recent developments in copper and group VIII to X metals as active materials. The authors compared both catalyst groups and concluded that copper-based catalysts exhibited higher activity, while group VIII to X metal-based catalysts outperformed copper in thermal and long-term stability. In terms of selectivity, catalysts with copper, platinum, and palladium as active materials favored the production of H2 and CO2, in contrast with most catalysts based on group VIII to X that favored CO. Yong et al. [12] looked at the different reaction mechanisms on the surface of the copper-based catalysts used for methanol reforming. They conceded that currently, the surface reaction mechanisms have not been established owing to complications arising from the secondary reactions: total oxidation of methanol (TOM), water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and partial oxidations of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). Iulianelli et al. [28] reviewed and compared hydrogen production from methanol via conventional and membrane steam reforming reactors. A reduction of total reactor weight and volume enabled further use in mobile reforming applications, selective hydrogen in a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions, and enhancement of methanol conversion by driving the MSR reaction forward. However, a technology and research gap in the production of high permeate fluxes in low pressures potentially translates to higher cost and lower stability during scaling up. Xu et al. [29] reviewed different catalysts based on copper and palladium for use in methanol steam reforming. The study reported on the comparable performance of Pd/ZnO to copper-based catalysts in MSR. Pd/ZnO showed relatively superior CO2 selectivity due to the formation of Pd–Zn alloys. Formaldehyde intermediates in the MSR reaction were transformed more effectively to H2 and CO2 over catalysts with Pd–Zn alloys in contrast with metallic Pd-dominated catalysts that favored H2 and CO."
3,Sustainability of energy systems,"1.3 Sustainability of energy systems There is a need to emphasize the sustainability of hydrogen production systems for energy due to the increasing demand for clean and green energy. Advanced sustainability tools such as exergy, exergoenvironmental, and exergoeconomic analyses are not currently in the scope of this review. However, it is imperative that these tools are given focus in the future to evaluate the energy systems’ holistic sustainability. Exergy-based methods that couple life-cycle analysis (LCA) considerations are increasingly popular tools to evaluate several aspects of biofuel energy [30]. Studies like Aghbashlo et al. [31] used exergoenvironmental analysis to evaluate the impact of the generation of the two routes (power generation and fertilizer production) from anaerobic digestion. This type of analysis showcases areas that need improvement in specific objectives. Another example is a study by Siddiqui and Dincer [32] that investigated a comparative well-to-pump life cycle analysis of different hydrogen production methods from ethanol and methanol. Highlighting the environmental effects of different routes."
4,Motivation and novelty statement,"1.4 Motivation and novelty statement At the time of writing, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no comprehensive review of hydrogen production from methanol looking at different pathways of conversion. The above reviews deal specifically with MSR, while methanol-specific reviews for POM, ATRM, and MD are not reported. This review aims to address this gap by a comprehensive examination of hydrogen production from methanol in the current literature. A comparison of four major pathways of methanol conversion is discussed. The purpose is to provide an understanding of recent developments in the field and compare different generating routes. Within these specific routes, an overview of catalyst development and reactor development is provided."
5,Methanol,"Methanol is a clear and colorless liquid with a sweet pungent odor that is soluble in water and a byproduct of the wood distillation industry. The first commercial process to produce methanol was established in 1830, while the first plant was established by BASF in 1923 [33]. At present, methanol is a worldwide chemical commodity with a capacity of 49 million metric tons in 2010 and is projected to reach 95 million metric tons by 2021 [34]. Formaldehyde synthesis is the main market for methanol, consisting of 27% of total demand, and other applications include olefin production, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) production, blending component for gasoline, and dimethyl ether (DME) production [7]. To date, the production of hydrogen from methanol is a niche market and is still in its infancy."
6,Sources of methanol,"2.1 Sources of methanol Commercial methanol is mostly generated from synthesis gas (syngas) by the catalytic reaction of its components: H2, CO, and CO2. The majority of the commercial methanol produced today comes from syngas from fossil fuels, either through the steam reforming of natural gas or the gasification of coal [34]. Nevertheless, emerging technologies and new research are looking at syngas from renewable sources such as biomass [35]. Eqs. (1) and (2) show the reactions to synthesize syngas from methane via steam reforming. Eq. (3) represents the water gas shift (WGS) [36] reaction that may occur during syngas formation or utilized in specific shift reactors to further convert CO and H2O to CO2 and H2, respectively. (1) CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 , Δ H 298 K = + 206 kJ mol − 1 (2) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + 4 H 2 , Δ H 298 K = + 165 kJ mol − 1 (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 , Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ mol − 1 Eqs. (4) and (5) represent methanol synthesis, usually over the industrial standard catalyst (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) [37]. In parallel, the reverse of the WGS reaction represented by Eq. (3) occurs. (4) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH + H 2 O , Δ H 298 K = − 50 kJ mol − 1 (5) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH , Δ H 298 K = − 91 kJ mol − 1 Bio-methanol, or methanol originating from biomass, is generated through multiple routes involving various processes. Fig. 3 details the different production routes from the primary source to methanol."
7,Methanol as a hydrogen carrier,"2.2 Methanol as a hydrogen carrier A unique fuel, methanol is advantageous as a hydrogen carrier in many aspects. It has the same H/C ratio as methane (4:1), but is a liquid at atmospheric pressure and typical environmental temperatures. Its low boiling point (65 °C) allows vaporization in roughly the same magnitude as water, and it is miscible in water enabling easier processing and containment [7,40]. The conversion of methanol to hydrogen occurs at a lower temperature range compared to other fuels. This has been attributed to the absence of C–C bonds in methanol that requires a higher energy input to break allowing a low-temperature operation leads to low CO levels [33]. Miscibility in water enables simplifies feed inlet design as water and methanol can be fed together and has anti-freezing properties as a solution. An important aspect of using methanol as a hydrogen vector is rapid and efficient conversion to H2 for utilization in energy applications. The subsequent sections will discuss these processes with methanol as feed for established thermochemical conversion processes such as steam reforming, partial oxidation, auto-thermal reforming, and methanol decomposition."
8,Methanol steam reforming (MSR),"Steam reforming is a well-known process of converting hydrocarbons into hydrogen due to its high efficiency and economic operation [44]. It generates more moles of hydrogen for every mole of methanol compared to the oxidation processes. Fig. 4 shows a schematic summary of MSR including subsequent steps. The reformer is usually coupled with a separator that harvests the high-purity H2 stream for applications such as PEMFCs. If high carbon monoxide levels are present, a shift reactor can be added to further convert the remaining CO into H2 and CO2."
9,Mechanisms,"3.1 Mechanisms MSR and MD reactions are expressed in Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively. WGSR, Eq. (3) consumes the carbon monoxide generated by MD to form additional hydrogen molecules. These three reactions depict the evolution of hydrogen from methanol [28]. Different reaction mechanisms are proposed by multiple researchers. (6) CH 3 OH + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + 3 H 2 Δ H 298 ° = + 50 kJ mol − 1 (7) CH 3 OH ↔ CO + 2 H 2 Δ H 298 ° = + 91 kJ mol − 1 The widespread use of copper-based catalysts in MSR extends from the use of the same catalyst in methanol synthesis [7]. The following literature investigates mechanisms of MSR over standard copper-based catalysts as it has widespread applications in industry and research. Yong et al. [12] discussed several mechanisms for the MSR reaction over copper-based catalysts. The first proposal was a sequential scheme of methanol decomposition followed by the water gas shift reaction (MD-WGS). Carbon monoxide was treated as the primary product, and the observation of low CO was attributed to the WGSR achieving equilibrium [45]. In this mechanism, it was proposed that Eq. (7) occurred first, followed by Eq. (3). An alternative proposal suggests that the products were directly generated from methanol dehydrogenation. The MSR mechanism is still an ongoing endeavor and an active area of research."
10,Catalyst development,"3.2 Catalyst development Catalysts in MSR are typically composed of active material, a promoter, and support. This section will discuss specifically Cu- and Pd-based catalysts because of their high activity and selectivity to the MSR reaction in conjunction with different promoters. 3.2.1 Copper-based catalysts In contrast with most of Group VIII to X metal catalysts that favor the production of syngas [46], copper-based catalysts favor the production of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, making it favorable for generating H2 for PEMFC applications. However, challenges encountered in the use of copper-based catalysts such as the high likelihood of sintering, sensitivity to sulfur and oxygen, and pyrophoricity can deactivate the catalysts. The effects of various variables have been investigated in the literature to understand catalyst performance. Reduction temperature, active site dispersion, active site surface area, promoter addition, and catalyst preparation methods are some of the variables investigated in the literature. The following subsections discuss literature that investigated the aforementioned variables. Cu/ZnO is an industry-wide catalyst used in low-temperature water gas shift, methanol synthesis, and MSR reactions. Conventionally, the formation of the catalyst starts with co-precipitating from a mixture of zinc and copper nitrates and sodium carbonate; this yields an amorphous precipitate that ages to a crystalline precursor. Mixed oxides of CuO and ZnO are obtained after drying and calcination, and are finally activated after the reduction of copper into its metallic state, usually by passing hydrogen gas as pretreatment. This pretreatment process is a difficult operation to bring to onboard systems [47]. There have been numerous observations of improvement in catalytic activity when ZnO is present with Cu, empirically confirming its role as a promoter. However, there is still no consensus on the promoting mechanism, and is still being investigated at present [48]. Burch et al. [49] proposed the spillover model where hydrogen was trapped by ZnO and facilitated hydrogenation in subsequent reactions. Yoshihara et al. [50], Ovesen et al. [51], Hadden et al. [52], and Topsoe et al. [53] suggested that the ZnO affected the morphology of active sites to. Lastly, Kanai et al. [54] attributed the promotion effect of ZnO to the Cu–Zn alloy formed after reduction. Copper-zinc catalysts are also used in conjunction with other promoters and support; and it is commonly utilized with Zirconia, Ceria, and Alumina. Nano-catalysts of copper and zinc were also investigated for MSR by Fasanya et al. [55]. The Zn nano-rods were grown in cordierite before impregnation with Cu. The nano-catalyst was evaluated for MSR in a fixed bed reactor between 180 and 350 °C. For temperatures at 180–230 °C, no CO production was observed for the methanol-to-water ratio of 0.8. This shows potential as an effective catalyst for MSR for low CO applications. Zirconium was also investigated in conjunction with Cu/ZnO and was found to enhance performance in multiple instances. The addition of ZrO2 has been reported to increase the dispersion of Cu crystallites within the catalyst. Jeong et al. [56] provided a comparison between Cu/ZnO, with and without the addition of Zr and Al2O3. The highest methanol conversion and lowest CO concentration were observed over the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst, attributing to the role of Zr in enhancing copper dispersion and forming small copper particles on the catalyst surface. Increased activity from the addition of Zr has been investigated by Yao et al. [57] using Cu/ZrO2 catalysts via different preparation methods. They reported that using oxalate gel co-precipitation resulted in high component dispersion and smaller copper crystallite size. Amorphous ZrO2 structure potentially caused the Cu–Zr interaction that lowers reduction temperature peaks. Sanches et al. [58] used Cu–Zn catalysts prepared by homogenous precipitation and reported that the presence of Zr increased lattice strain, making Cu crystals more accessible to reactants leading to higher methanol conversion. Zr also promoted the formation of Cu–Zn alloy that has been shown to improve methanol conversion. Sanches et al. [59] further investigated the effect of Zr on Cu/ZnO catalysts. The results indicated that increased microstrain exposed active CuO sites to reactants, increasing catalyst reducibility. The authors attributed the increase in microstrain to the distortion of the crystalline geometry of the Cu/ZnO catalyst with the embedding of amorphous Zr. Another alkaline oxide, cerium (Ce) has been reported to affect dispersion, redox behavior, and catalytic activity in copper-based catalysts [7]. Ce can adsorb oxygen as the oxidation state shifts from Ce (III) to Ce (IV). Oxygen is then released to react with carbon in the catalyst surface to suppress coke deposition [22]. This unique redox behavior has made ceria an interesting promoter, as evidenced by multiple studies investigating its effect on the activity and stability of copper-based catalysts. Liu et al. [60] reported that Cu/CeO2 catalysts had better performance than Cu/ZnO. Interaction of CeO2 with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 enhanced activity and hydrogen selectivity. Zhang et al. [61] tested the performance of various catalysts promoters loaded in copper (Cu/ZnO, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, Cu/ZnO/CeO2, Cu/ZnO/ZrO2, and Cu/ZnO/CeO2/ZrO2) for steam reforming, and observed a very stable performance for Cu/ZnO/CeO2/ZrO2 with no noticeable deactivation in 360 h of operation. Baneshi et al. [62] used a homogenous precipitation method to generate a CuO/ZrO2/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst. The presence of ceria led to better and more uniform dispersion, smaller Cu particle size, higher methanol conversion, low CO selectivity, and high stability. Wan et al. [63] doped CeO2 into CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 and observed that Ce lowered the activity of the catalyst but decreased CO selectivity. In summary, ceria has been reported as advantageous support to copper-based catalysts. It improves dispersion, particle size, and stability, while suppresses coke formation, making the catalyst active for a long duration. The addition of Ce drives selectivity towards H2 and CO2, and lowers CO, making it ideal for fuel cell applications. However, there are conflicting reports of the effect of Ce on Cu catalyst activity for MSR. There are cases that the presence of Ce lowered activity in the aforementioned studies. Other metals that are being investigated as promoters or supports for copper-based catalysts, Yang et al. [64] synthesized Cu/Zn–Al catalysts with rare earth metal modifications and a Zn–Al hydrotalcite precursor. Yttrium (Y), lanthanum (L), cerium (Ce), samarium (Sm), and gadolinium (Gd) were investigated. The results showed that Ce, Sm, and Gd addition improved copper dispersion, surface area, and catalyst reducibility in comparison to unmodified Cu/Zn–Al catalyst with Ce/Cu/Zn–Al outperforming all other modified catalysts. Other metals such as Indium were tested by Matsumura et al. [65]. The addition of In2O3 stabilized the catalyst, and inhibited CO formation, however, at inferior catalyst activity. Gallium (Ga) addition into Cu/ZnO catalyst has been reported to perform well in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [66]. Toyir et al. [13], Pohar et al. [67], and Liu et al. [13] showed that the presence of Ga increased Cu catalyst activity. Nano-catalysts of Cu catalysts with other metals are also investigated. Nano-powders of a catalyst of Cu, Cr, and Fe (CuCr1-xFexO2 at x = 0–1) were investigated by Hwang et al. [68] for MSR at 350 °C. The application of nano-catalysts can be applied to fuel cell vehicles due to its simplicity and high efficiency and stability. 3.2.2 Pd-based catalysts Group VIII metal-based catalysts (Ni, Rh, Pd, and Pt) have outstanding thermal stability when compared with copper-based catalysts, this implies a lower propensity to sinter at temperatures above 300 °C (a primary reason for catalyst deactivation). However, the aforementioned metals favor the production of syngas (CO and H2) instead of hydrogen (H2 and CO2) in MSR [69]. For MSR, Palladium (Pd) is shown to favor the same intermediary steps as copper-based catalysts when mixed with ZnO [70]. Ranganathan et al. [71] carried out MSR over Pd/ZnO and Pd/CeO2 and compared the effects of Zn against Ce. They accounted for the shift in selectivity on the quantity of acidic or basic active sites where Pd/ZnO had more acidic sites, thus favoring CO2 production. In contrast, Chin et al. [72] reported a highly active and selective Pd/Zn catalyst that was able to for Pd–Zn alloy at moderate temperatures (>300 °C) in reducing conditions. Iwasa et al. [73] also attributed the promotion of MSR and increased CO2 selectivity to the alloying of Pd with Zn in reductive conditions. They extended experiments to include other metals such as Cd, In, and Ga, and confirmed that alloying increased MSR activity and selectivity over MD. Iwasa et al. [74] investigated Pd/ZnO, Pd/Al2O3, and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts in MSR and showed that Pd was highly affected by the choice of support. They reported that using ZrO2 as support best enhanced the dispersion of Pd within the catalyst, but the Pd/ZnO provided the best selectivity for MSR. Further research of the Pd/ZnO catalyst by Iwasa et al. [75] showed that a prior reduction of the catalyst at higher temperatures would result in greater activity. They attributed this effect to the formation of more Pd–Zn alloys during prior reduction that further increased desired behaviors in the catalyst. Kim et al. [76] investigated the effects of Ru addition to Pd/Al2O3 catalysts on MSR. The authors compared the performances of Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/Ru/Al2O3 catalysts and reported the enhanced activity with Ru addition. The enhanced activity was attributed to alloying of Pd and Ru that resulted in decreased Pd particle size, and a high degree of dispersion throughout the catalyst. Temperature-programmed desorption analyses revealed that Pd–Ru alloying increased the desorption rate of the CO species adsorbed in the Pd active site. This step was revealed to be the rate-determining step and consequently increasing the reaction activity of MSR when Ru was added."
11,Reactors,"3.3 Reactors Traditional MSR reactors are tubular in a design filled with catalyst particles in a packed-bed configuration. A packed-bed reactor design has high pressure drops and unbalanced heat transfer within the system [77]. A high pressure drop within the reactor increases the pumping power required to keep a steady stream of methanol and water flowing in the reactor, while poor heat transfer characteristics produce inefficiencies within the reactor creating local differences. Microreactors address this by scaling reactor configurations to inner dimensions in the magnitude of millimeters [28,78]. Catalyst compatibility, reactant-catalyst contact, and pressure drop are important variables to consider in the design of an MSR reactor. Fig. 5 , based on the study of Iulianelli et al. [28], shows the different configurations discussed for conventional MSR reactors. Coil-based reactor designs (Fig. 5a) yield high conversions but with trade-offs in pressure drop that can be a restriction for compact applications. In contrast to coil-based reactors, rectilinear channel reactor designs (Fig. 5b) have low pressure drops but have low conversions because of sporadic distributions of mass [78]. A pinhole design (Fig. 5c) has the advantages of coil-based reactors in terms of conversions at lower pressure drops, but has a more complicated control due to a mass distribution that is dependent on the flow conditions [79]. Lastly, radial reactor designs (Fig. 5d) are highly compatible with MSR due to increasing sectional area when the product gas exits the reactor, lowering the pressure drop in comparison with tubular reactors with a constant velocity profile [80]. There are different strategies used in the design of microreactors. Channel wall coating was explored by Bravo et al. [81]. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 was used to coat a microchannel reactor on quartz and fused silica. The microchannel performance was a significant improvement over the same catalyst in a packed-bed configuration. Xinxin et al. [82] performed MSR in a wall-coated reactor with a PdZn/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalyst, and achieved 100% methanol conversion and a low CO selectivity at 0.5% in stable operation. Tajrishi et al. [83] used a wall-coated reactor to carry out MSR to test the performance of Cu/SAB-15-based nanocatalysts. Sanz et al. [77] compared coated micro-etched and micro-milled plates for MSR. They demonstrated high selectivity for H2 (75.0%) and CO2 (23.5%), and low levels of CH3OH (0.06%) and CO (1.44%), and concluded that chemical etching and milling had similar performances but chemical etching had the advantage of easy adaptation to large scale production. The key for wall-coated reactors is to have a uniform catalyst surface that maximizes surface area and lowers deposition on corners. Shedding, low adhesion, and high machining costs are barriers to the utilization of wall-coated reactors [84]. Packed-bed microreactors use conventional catalysts in microreactors. By utilizing conventional catalysts, the set-up of these reactors is simple and economic. Flow plugging and high pressure drops are the key disadvantages of packed-bed micro-reactors [85]. Catalyst structures are employed to minimize pressure drop that can be pre-coated outside the reactor fabrication rendering machining more economical. Zhou et al. [84] investigated the performance of porous copper fiber sintered felt (PCFSF) as a catalyst structure for an MSR microreactor. PCFSF was coated with Cu/Zn/Al/Zr. Zhou et al. [86] further extended the study on PCFSF to include the effect of fiber material, surface morphology, and different Cu/Al ratios in the support. Their results indicated that a rough morphology showed better performance in terms of methanol conversion. Membrane reactors incorporate membrane components that can be either an extractor, distributor, or contactor [28]. An extractor separates a desired product from the reactor by selective permeation, a distributor controls the rate of addition of a specific reactant, and a contactor intensifies the interaction and contact of catalyst and reactants. A membrane separator coupled with the reformer is an efficient way to address this challenge as well as reduce capital and operating costs [87]. The removal of hydrogen within a reactor system will shift the equilibrium in favor of the forward MSR reaction, and can lower the operating temperature and increase methanol conversion. Basile et al. [88] investigated MSR in varying water/methanol molar ratios and reaction temperatures in a fixed bed reactor coupled to a dense Pd–Ag membrane over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3/MgO. The setup with the membrane reactor performed better in terms of methanol conversion and H2 production than the fixed bed reactor alone. Ghasemzadeh et al. [89] used a silica membrane reactor for carrying out MSR and developed a one-dimensional isothermal model to assess the effects of catalyst loading, sweep gas flow rate, and H2 selectivity at different temperatures and pressures. Catalyst loading and sweep gas flow rate had a positive correlation with the MR performance, increasing H2 selectivity and yield."
12,Partial oxidation of methanol (POM),"Partial oxidation occurs when fuel and air are partially reacted or combusted in a reactor to create hydrogen-rich syngas. Air fed to the reactor is limited to inhibit the total oxidation reaction of hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water. It is controlled in such a way that the amount of oxygen is well below the stoichiometric requirement for full oxidation, resulting in a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with nitrogen and other trace elements [90]. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are formed in a succeeding WGS reactor from water and carbon monoxide from syngas [91]. MSR is a favored thermochemical pathway to generate hydrogen because of its high yield. However, MSR requires heat input to proceed because it is an endothermic reaction. On the other hand, POM is an exothermic process that generates heat as the reaction moves forward; it is kinetically faster and requires a smaller reactor vessel in comparison to MSR. Chen et al. [92] cold-started POM using ultra-low weight Pt/Al2O3 and (hexagonal boron nitride) h-BN-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, achieving hydrogen production without any preheating done. Temperature control, however, is a focal challenge in highly exothermic conditions. A higher reactor temperature shifts selectivity towards carbon monoxide and away from hydrogen [93]. Typically, POM has half the hydrogen selectivity of MSR and higher CO. Methanol is a favorable feedstock option for partial oxidation [94], and several studies have compared its performance with methane or higher hydrocarbons. The C–C bond in methanol reduces the coke formation that causes deactivation [95]. Operational conditions for POM can also be adjusted rapidly, improving control [96]. Catalytic POM has also reported higher conversions at lower temperatures than partial oxidation systems using methane."
13,Reactions,"4.1 Reactions The overall POM is a highly exothermic reaction and can be expressed by Eq. (8). (8) CH 3 OH + 0.5 O 2 ↔ 2 H 2 + CO 2 Δ H 298 ° = − 192 kJ mol − 1 The total system of reactions for POM, however, is more complex and involves different pathways for methanol and oxygen [97]. Otsuka et al. [98] and Lyubovsky et al. [99] proposed that intermediate reactions for POM are: MSR (Eq. (6)), MD (Eq. (7)), WGS (Eq. (3)), methanol combustion (Eq. (9)), methanation (Eqs. (10) and (11)), and oxidative hydrogenation of methanol (Eq. (12)). (9) CH 3 OH + 1.5 O 2 ↔ CO 2 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 ° = − 675.4 kJ mol − 1 (10) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H 298 ° = − 206.2 kJ mol − 1 (11) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 ° = − 164.9 kJ mol − 1 (12) CH 3 OH + 0.5 O 2 ↔ HCHO + H 2 O Δ H 298 ° = − 157.0 kJ mol − 1 The aforementioned reactions describe proposed mechanisms for POM that are still being explored in literature today."
14,Catalyst development,"4.2 Catalyst development Catalysts employed in POM systems have been categorized based on the active materials used and are generally classified into noble and non-noble metals. Operating temperatures for POM are above 200 °C to yield a high methanol conversion. The selectivity for CO2 and H2 in POM is highly dependent on the catalyst. Considering various metals, the most extensively used for POM are copper-based materials due to their high activity [99]. In this section, the literature investigating different active metals, promoters, and supports for catalytic POM is reviewed. Cu/Zn is a natural extension for converting methanol into hydrogen. Huang and Wang [19] first introduced POM using a Cu/Zn catalyst in 1986. The catalysts were prepared from co-precipitation in different compositions of Cu and Zn by weight and underwent activity measurements post-reduction. The study demonstrated exothermic POM at the optimum composition of 20–40% copper by weight with a promising high rate of hydrogen production. Alejo et al. [100] observed a positive correlation between surface area and activity. Increasing copper loading above 40 wt% decreased activity. Chen et al. [18] observed that temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) peaks of catalysts increased with higher copper loading. This means that during reduction pretreatment, higher copper loading required an increased quantity of hydrogen and a higher temperature to reduce CuO into active metallic Cu. The study attributed this effect to the possible increase of Cu crystallite size, lower dispersion of Cu, and weaker interactions with the supports at higher copper compositions. There is an optimum composition of copper in a Cu/Zn catalyst. An excess of copper (above 40 %wt.) lowers the metal surface area and dispersion as observed by the aforementioned literature. Alejo et al. [100] investigated Cu/ZnO and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts in POM. The catalysts used demonstrated high activity and selectivity for H2 and CO2. The study reported that the activity of POM increased with the measured Cu metal surface area where Cu–Zn interfaces play a role in modifying dispersion and particle size of copper. Additionally, the presence of Al in the catalyst inhibited methanol conversion but improved stability and selectivity for CO2. Chi et al. [101] investigated the effect of the oxidation state of Cu in the catalyst on the selectivity. The study reported an increased H2 selectivity with higher amounts of reduced metallic copper (Cu0), while CO2 selectivity is primarily driven by the O2 partial pressure. The results indicated contradicting constraints as an increase in O2 partial pressure in the feed results in the metallic copper to oxidize faster into Cu2O, lowering the H2 selectivity. Presently, a need to further elucidate the activity in different oxidation states is needed to determine the most active state of a metal. Wang et al. [102] evaluated the effects of various noble metal promoters on Cu/Cr on catalyst performance. The methanol conversion, CO selectivity, H2 selectivity, and CO2 selectivity were used to measure the catalyst performance and are summarized in Fig. 6 . Copper has low stability during operation because of the high risk of sintering [100]. Using a similar approach in MSR, Pd-based catalysts were evaluated for POM due to its high stability and long operations on-stream. Catalysts based on metallic palladium (Pd0) have been found to favor decomposition products (H2 and CO) similar to other Group VIII to X metals. Pd–Zn alloy, however, interacted in a way that was found to be selective to reforming products (H2 and CO2) and offer a high methanol conversion rate in POM [103,104]. Pd/Zn catalysts report comparable methanol conversion levels to Cu-based catalysts and similar selectivity. Agrell et al. [14] prepared Pd and Pd/ZnO catalysts for use in POM. The results indicated that Pd/ZnO selectively converted methanol into H2 and CO2 but with a higher rate of CO generation when compared with Cu-based catalysts. Other materials such as silver (Ag) and gold (Au) have been investigated as potential catalysts. Mo et al. [105] found that Ag supported by ZnO, Al2O3, and ZnO–Al2O3 was active towards POM; unfortunately, Ag-catalysts were observed to have low selectivity towards hydrogen. Potentially, modifying Ag/ZnO with CeO2 can improve H2 selectivity. Fig. 7 summarizes the performances of different Ag-based catalyst as investigated by Mo et al. [105]. Platinum (Pt) has high activity as a catalyst in POM with some studies reporting low CO product levels [106] (see Table 1). Chen et al. [107] utilized an ultra-low composition of platinum (0.2%) in POM. At a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 20,000 h−1, hydrogen production was achieved without pre-heating. However, cold starting POM had a lower conversion compared with a set-up with pre-heating. Table 2 shows a summary of recent studies regarding catalyst development for POM."
15,Reactors,"4.3 Reactors Unlike MSR reactors, the absence of steam simplifies most designs. The conventional design of packed-bed reactors is still the least complex. A non-uniform reaction surface in a packed-bed configuration contributes to varied heat transfer within the system. Similar to MSR, this creates hot spots within the reactor, creating inefficiencies within the system. Agrell et al. [14] reported a 60–120 K temperature difference between the furnace wall and the catalyst bed in a PBR for POM. Additionally, Kulprathipanja and Falconer [93] observed that the reactor temperature jumped by 100 K during POM set at 565 K. The catalyst bed exhibited bright orange hot spots and increased CO selectivity. Due to the exothermic nature of POM, these thermal jumps are uncontrolled and can disrupt the design for the desired reaction. 4.3.1 Thin-film tubular reactor To manage temperature jumps, thin-film tubular reactors (TFTR) were employed by Kulprathipanja and Falconer [93]. An indium and tin oxide catalyst was prepared by simultaneous precipitation and mixed with Al2O3. The solution was deposited in a tubular reactor. The use of TFTR in POM eliminated the thermal jumps that were observed in PBR. Because of the better temperature control, CO levels were also minimized. However, due to the geometry of TFTRs, increasing space time may prove difficult, and may require recirculation to achieve enough contact time between reactants and catalysts. As observed in the aforementioned study, more hydrogen was formed at higher space times in TFTR. 4.3.2 Structured reactor Porous support structures can be coated with catalysts and used in reactors to minimize plugging for POM. With proper design, enough contact can be established between the catalyst and reactants by the structure. Kulprathipanja and Falconer [93] tested a monolith tank reactor for POM. The reactor was observed to have a temperature difference within the monolith, with the higher temperature observed nearer the heater. But the geometry of the monolith tank reactor allowed for higher contact between reactants and catalysts. 4.3.3 Swiss roll reactor A recent reactor design in POM is the Swiss-roll reactor. Chen et al. [106] conducted POM in a Swiss-roll reactor using h-BN-Pt/Al2O3 as the catalyst. The radial design of the reactor makes the hotter product and cooler reactant streams flow countercurrent to each other, improving heat transfer and acting as pre-heating for the reaction. This is a marked improvement from the heat transfer limitations of conventional reactors. Hydrogen production was achieved from a cold start using the aforementioned catalyst and reactor. The authors concluded that the Swiss roll reactor was a capable reactor to simultaneously recover the excess enthalpy while catering POM with high efficiency for hydrogen production in the industry."
16,Autothermal reforming of methanol (ATRM),"Autothermal reforming is a process involving both partial oxidation and steam reforming reaction systems [44]. The fuel reacts with both air and steam to produce hydrogen-rich gas. Autothermal reforming of methanol (ATRM) uses sufficient heat generated from exothermic POM to trigger endothermic MSR with the ideal mixture of air, steam, and fuel. ATRM is ideally operated at a thermoneutral point where the system neither release nor consume external energy [113]. This replaces the external heat input for MSR reactors making ATRM setups relatively simpler with lower capital costs. Compared to POM, ATRM has better heat recovery and increased hydrogen yields."
17,Reactions,"5.1 Reactions The system of reactions that describe ATRM is derived from both Eq. (6) for MSR and Eq. (8) for POM. The reactant ratio is theoretically calculated so that the reaction will be thermally neutral [114]. But in a general form, ATRM is described by Eq. (13). (13) CH 3 OH + ( 1 − 2 r ) H 2 O + rO 2 ↔ ( 3 − 2 r ) H 2 + CO 2 Δ H 298 ° = ( − 241.8 ( 2 r ) + 49.5 ) KJ mol − 1 , 0 ≦ r ≦ 0.5 The “r” in the equation represents the ratio between oxygen and methanol fed to the reaction."
18,Catalyst development,"5.2 Catalyst development Suitable catalysts for ATRM need to be active for both POM and MSR under oxidation and reduction conditions, simultaneously [60]. Because of the large difference in the reaction rates between the endothermic steam reforming reaction and the exothermic methanol oxidation, the primary parameter that needs to be controlled in the reactor is the temperature. Table 3 shows a summary of the catalysts discussed by Chen et al. [46]. Cu-based catalysts have high dispersion related to high catalyst activity. However, Cu is prone to sintering leading to deactivation [15]. CeO2 is a viable option supporting Cu in ATRM [121]. The unique redox property of Ce enables it to be versatile and is suitable for preventing coking [122]. Hori et al. [123] suggested that Zr is a compatible dopant to alter the chemical and structural properties of Cu–Ce, improving stability and activity. Zn-based catalysts for ATRM showed considerable activity. Liu et al. [60] used pelletized ZnO–Cr2O3 at relatively high temperatures for ATRM, and showed good activity. Different supports for zinc catalyst were evaluated by Liu et al. [60] and is summarized in Fig. 8 . Based on the evaluation, Cr as support shows the highest methanol conversion, while Zr shows the highest hydrogen selectivity. Table 4 shows additional catalysts in the literature."
19,Reactors,"5.3 Reactors The majority of hydrogen generated in ATRM comes from MSR because of the additional hydrogen formed from water [132]. Due to the endothermic nature of MSR, oxygen is added in the reactor to generate heat chemically via POM [133]. The system then needs an input of an oxygen carrier, either pure oxygen or more commonly, air [134]. ATRM reactors in the literature show similar strategies as MSR and POM reactor designs. Extensive use of packed-bed reactors in different geometries represent the bulk of the designs. Unique packing of catalysts can provide advantages in ATRM. Richards et al. [135] used a stratified catalyst bed coupled with a Cu-based catalyst. The reactor showed fairly high methanol conversion at low O2/MeOH ratios compared to conventional packed-bed reactor configuration. Similar to MSR and POM, monolithic structures were used to improve the surface area and pressure drops in ATRM. Sanz et al. [136] used a monolithic catalyst that proved advantageous in providing heat to the downstream pellets. Novel feeding designs can also improve efficiency and activity. Johnson Matthey developed a reactor for ATRM over a Cu–Si catalyst named “Hot Spot” reactor [127,137]. The reactants were point injected in the middle of the catalyst bed. They produced a local high-temperature region that enabled the endothermic reforming reactions in the rest of the catalyst bed. Mu et al. [117] had successfully fabricated a mini-reactor composed of a reforming chamber, a catalytic combustion chamber, and two pre-heating chambers. The mini-reactor could be started at room temperature by the initial combustion of methanol to drive ATRM, producing hydrogen. Optimal methanol conversion achieved was 96.4%, with a reformed gas containing 51.04% H2, 26.68% N2, 2.12% CO, and 20.16% CO2."
20,Methanol decomposition (MD),"Methanol decomposition (MD) is an endothermic reaction that dissociates methanol into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. MD occurs to completion at low temperatures but at significantly slower kinetics than reforming and oxidation. An MD reactor may utilize waste heat from engine exhaust heat in in-situ applications with higher efficiency than gasoline or direct methanol [138]. Multiple catalysts have been historically investigated for MD; Cu, Ni, group VIII metals, and Zn/Cr catalysts have been evaluated by literature in different structures, preparation methods, and components [27,138]. MD is an attractive option for the production of hydrogen because it can reach a 100% conversion at a temperature of 473 K at atmospheric pressure [27]. It has potential applications as a fuel processor for portable power [139], high-pressure applications in gas turbines [140], in-situ reformers in internal combustion engines, and material for chemical and material processing [138]. In this section, the discussion will focus on the reaction mechanism (6.1) and catalysts (6.2)."
21,Reactions,"6.1 Reactions The MD reaction has been described in Eq. (7) and is included in the systems of reactions that describe MSR and POM. There is a consensus from experimental results that in MD over Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, and Fe surfaces, that methanol is adsorbed molecularly and forms a methoxy group adsorbed on the metal at higher temperatures [141]. The further decomposition steps of the methoxy group into the final products of CO and H2, however, are still highly debated. Zuo et al. [142] identified different reaction pathways for methanol over a Cu surface. Pathways for MD, MSR, and methanol oxidation were evaluated. For MD, the foremost reaction path identified was an initial scission of the O–H bond into a methoxy intermediate. The methoxy group underwent abstractions of H into CH2O, then into CHO, and finally into CO. However, the calculated rate constants in the temperature range of 473–573 K for the rate-limiting step of MD are lower relative to MSR and methanol oxidation, establishing that oxidation and reforming are faster than MD. A similar path was observed by Huberty et al. [143] for MD over a Ni surface, while Tawarah and Hansen [144] reported a similar path for MD over ZnO."
22,Catalyst development,"6.2 Catalyst development Initial investigation of MD catalysts was focused on Cu/ZnO catalysts due to their effectivity in low-temperature catalysis of methanol synthesis [145]. However, multiple active metals may be used: Cu-based catalysts are regarded as low-temperature catalysts operating at 200–275 °C, Zn/Cr catalysts typically operate at 350 °C, while Pt-based catalysts have optimal activity at above 400 °C [140]. Cheng [146] investigated the effect of ZnO and other metal promoters such as Cr, barium (Ba), and manganese (Mn) on Cu-based catalysts for MD at 250 °C. The study reported that ZnO, a highly effective promoter for Cu in methanol synthesis, had a significant detrimental effect on the activity, selectivity, and stability of the Cu-based catalyst in MD. The presence of Zn in the system limited the activity of all catalysts to conversions of around 35%, while without Zn, the conversion was in the range of 50–85%. The Cu/Cr catalysts also showed high selectivity to CO. The Cr content was also found to promote a reaction pathway to dimethyl ether and was required to be optimized to reduce the loss of selectivity to CO. Cheng [138] further investigated the effect of SiO2, alkali metals, and Mn and Ba oxides on promoting MD over Cu catalysts. Small amounts of alkali metals or SiO2 showed increasing dispersion of Cu that helped stabilize and maximize surface area for the reaction. Li et al. [24] used a spinel structure of copper to improve stability in hydrogen production using MD. Potassium (K) was also added to the catalyst to improve the selectivity to CO and H2. The spinel structure (CuAl2O4) acted as a reservoir of the active metal during the process and released Cu gradually, preventing rapid deactivation by sintering. Qing et al. [147] further investigated the deactivation of Cu in MD using a Cu/SiO2 catalyst for a long operation time. Rapid deactivation of catalyst occurred both in the initial operation (0–20 h) and the advance stage (200–296 h). The initial deactivation was attributed to coking and sintering of Cu. The final stage was due to loss of the support structure of the catalyst and was an irreversible degradation of the SiO2 during operation. Due to the high deactivation rate of copper and the need for both active and stable catalysts, multiple metals have been evaluated in the literature. One of these metals is Nickel (Ni), an active catalyst for MD. Matsumura et al. [26] performed MD over Ni supported by silica. An optimal Ni content of 40% showed the highest conversion rate of around 65% at 250 °C. The study reported that the crystallinity of Ni particles on the surface played a major role in the activity of the catalyst. The amount of adsorbed products (CO and H2) on the surface has been noted to improve activity. Pd and Pt were also investigated for MD. Lee et al. [148] evaluated the activity of Pd and Pt over silica and alumina supports for MD. The catalysts were active at temperatures 453–573 K. Pd reported a higher activity than Pt, while alumina-supported catalysts were more active than silica-supported ones. However, alumina-supported catalysts produced a dimethyl ether byproduct. Recent work has been reviewed by Araiza et al. [149] on bimetallic catalysts for MD. Bi-metallic catalysts composed of Cu paired with either Pd, Pt, or Ni was supported on nanoceria (CeO2). The addition of another metal influenced the dispersion of the active materials and ultimately improved activity, regardless of the metal added to Cu."
23,Perspectives and challenges,"The methanol economy was conceptualized by Nobel Prize recipient George A. Olah with the proposal to utilize renewable methanol in place of fossil fuel resources. Olah [150] suggested that methanol could be industrially generated by direct oxidative conversion of CH4 or reductive conversion of atmospheric CO2 with hydrogen. Olah’s vision positions methanol as a convenient storage medium that can be used either as a fuel in energy applications, or as a chemical feedstock to generate hydrocarbons. China has attempted to build a methanol economy and has been the most advanced nation to adopt its energy and chemical industry as such. Yao et al. [151] investigated the environmental implications of the proposed methanol economy in China. The current dominant production route based on coal performed worse than gasoline in a well-to-wheel perspective. However, methanol is largely utilized directly in this study, not as hydrogen. Yang and Jackson [152] reviewed the effect of the current methanol policy in place. The use of methanol-based technologies provides an inexpensive fuel that improves urban air quality. However, the current production routes still depend heavily on coal, ultimately increasing net GHG emissions, and exacerbate coal market volatility. Biomass-based methanol was identified by both studies as a key pathway to lower greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate competition for fossil resources, and drastically decrease primary energy consumption. However, huge capital considerations make renewable methanol uncompetitive in the short term [151], while policy and government have no concrete plans to support it [152]. Gumber et al. [153] compared the methanol and hydrogen economies. The key challenge for the application of the methanol economy is the cost and complexity of building renewable methanol sources and efficient conversion technologies to hydrogen. Energy applications post-conversion to hydrogen should be considered during technology selection. An example is the use of methanol in internal combustion engines by reforming the methanol on-board vehicle. This application does not require a low selectivity of CO as it can be further combusted in ICEs. Verhelst et al. [154] pointed out that the gap in future research has to address methanol utilization for internal combustion engines. Gaps in life cycle assessment of methanol-fueled vehicles, methanol engine efficiency, onboard reforming with engine waste heat, and cost-effectiveness of methanol-to-movement. Fuel cells such as PEMFC are clean technologies. However, it requires high purity hydrogen that is still a challenge. Finding methanol-to-hydrogen routes that provide high conversion and yield at lower temperatures and rapid kinetics is paramount to scale PEMFCs. Alternatively, a combination of scaling purification technologies like semi-permeable membranes with highly active catalysts can be explored. Several pathways have been presented in this study to produce methanol as well as transforming it into hydrogen for further utilization. The utilization of methanol-hydrogen systems in the future require advanced technologies that deliver increased efficiencies in the areas of methanol production from biomass or atmospheric carbon. The future cost of the biomass feedstock should not overly appreciate. The gasification of biomass to methanol can be further improved by improving gas cleaning, reformers, shift processes, and highly selective separation processes. Future hydrogen production from methanol will feature improved catalysts that are highly selective to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. These catalysts will be stable for long durations of time and a wide range of temperature levels. These will likely come from different catalyst configurations such as spinel catalysts that provide high reactive areas and stable configurations. Synthesizing active catalysts will also play an important role. Separation processes for H2 will also play an important role in increasing the overall efficiency of the system. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and ceramic membranes will allow high purity output streams while driving the reaction towards H2 production."
24,Conclusions,"Deep decarbonization of the energy and transport sector increases the need for the development of hydrogen technologies. Methanol as a hydrogen carrier addresses multiple problems associated with the logistics of hydrogen gas for energy applications. Methanol is a future-proof material and is a versatile fuel that can be sourced from sustainable. It is in a unique position that can bridge current fuel technology and applications to a sustainable future. Methanol can also be sourced from atmospheric CO2, making it a step closer to an envisioned methanol economy. The development of technologies to convert methanol into hydrogen is increasingly important. In this review, methanol steam reforming (MSR), partial oxidation of methanol (POM), autothermal reforming of methanol (ATRM), and methanol decomposition (MD) have been discussed and compared. MSR is featured by its endothermic nature, high conversion, selective formation of H2, and low CO generation, and easier temperature control. However, MSR is sluggish at start-up and requires an additional input of heat to drive the reaction forward. Catalyst development has been focused on copper, but there is a growing interest in Pd–Zn catalysts that offer a comparable activity and selectivity. Research in reactor design for MSR has been gearing towards microreactors with microchannels and microstructures (monolith, sintered felt, etc.). Membrane reactors for improving kinetics and separation are also a ripe area of research that may rival the conventional pressure swing adsorption process. POM reaction units can warm up easily by adjusting the oxygen flow rate to increase fuel combustion. There is a high risk of producing CO due to the difficult temperature control, and POM is still at lower levels of hydrogen yield compared to reforming. The rapid start of POM provides easier start-up and changeovers. A key part of recent POM research is the ability to cold start using novel catalysts and reactor design. Swiss roll reactors improve heat transfer limitations from conventional reactor designs. However, activity and selectivity remain an important improvement to be unlocked for POM. In ATRM, air and water are already fed to the reactor, making it simpler and easier to design when it comes to reactor selection. ATRM theoretically run at a thermos-neutral system, it neither uses nor produces external energy. This characteristic of ATR makes it more efficient and with better hydrogen selectivity compared to POM. At the same time, ATR has a better dynamic response compared to MSR and has the possibility to accommodate numerous fuels. MD is part of the system of reactions that describe the other modes of hydrogen production. It was believed to be the initial step for MSR and POM in some reports and has a kinetically slower reaction than MSR and POM. MD generates CO and is usually minimized for PEMFC applications. However, it is favored in in-situ reforming for internal combustion engines as CO is combustible. Table 5 compares these four routes of hydrogen production from methanol. The different processes discussed in this paper help guide the reader to understand the key methanol-to-hydrogen pathways and the flow of catalyst and reactor technology development in the past decades."
