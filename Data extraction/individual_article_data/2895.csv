0,Introduction,"Development of energy self-dependent wastewater treatment techniques would be important in the coming years considering environmental and economic sustainability aspects. Our fossil fuel based economy has led to fast depletion of conventional energy resources, on one hand, and caused environmental pollution leading to the problem of global climate change, on the other. Gradual substitution of fossil fuel based energy production by new and clean energy alternative has therefore, become necessary. One such environmentally acceptable energy resource is hydrogen. Traditionally, hydrogen is produced by steam methane reformer technique, which gives CO2 emissions or by electrolysis of water, which is energy intensive. Hydrogen production by microorganisms, on the other hand, involves the use of abundantly available natural resources like solar energy and water. Biohydrogen production is environmentally benign, being less energy intensive and non-polluting. Amongst the prokaryotes cyanobacteria have been suggested as ideal candidates for biological production of hydrogen [1], involving relatively cheaper inputs and simpler mass cultivation. Studies on biochemical pathways of hydrogen production have revealed direct involvement of three enzymes identified as nitrogenase, uptake hydrogenase and bidirectional hydrogenase [2]. Oxygen sensitivity of these enzymes has been dealt with using oxygen absorbers [3] or by indirect photolysis, separating the hydrogen and oxygen evolving processes temporally [4]. Heterocystous cyanobacteria tackle this problem by spatial separation of the hydrogen and oxygen evolving activities [5]. While efforts are underway to promote enhanced and sustained hydrogen production, the rates of production decline after some time and the spent biomass generated is dumped as a waste. In our batch studies, we have earlier reported that about 80–90% of the heavy metals like Cr and Co [6,7] and 75–95% of dyes like Reactive Red and Crystal Violet [8,9] can be removed by the 7 d old spent biomass from a hydrogen bioreactor using different combinations of operating parameters based on various models of RSM approach. It is however, important to investigate the biosorption phenomenon in continuous column with the ultimate aim to integrate it to the biohydrogen production process in a dynamic mode. In the present investigation hydrogen production by Nostoc linckia was studied in free as well as immobilized forms in photobioreactors (PBRs). The PBR with free biomass (PBRfr) was run for 7 days and the reactor waste after immobilizing in alginate was used for bioremoval of two metals (chromium and cobalt) and carcinogenic dyes (Reactive Red 198 and Crystal Violet) from aqueous solution in column mode, optimizing flow rate and column height followed by analysis of breakthrough curves using BDST model. For achieving enhanced rates of hydrogen production, optimized physico-chemical conditions were maintained in PBR and the live cyanobacterial biomass immobilized in alginate matrix was used. Three PBRs containing immobilized cyanobacterial biomass (PBRimm-I, -II, -III) were run for 5, 15 and 25 days, respectively. Exogenous carbohydrate supplement was given and sparging with argon (Ar) was done at different stages to replenish the endogenous substrate and create anaerobic conditions required to restore the declining rates of hydrogen production in the PBR. The biomass waste generated from the reactors was used for biosorption of the two metals, Cr and Co, and two dyes, Reactive Red 198 and Crystal Violet, in packed-bed columns under optimized bed height and flow rate."
1,Experimental,
2,Hydrogen production studies,"2.1 Hydrogen production studies N. linckia HA-46, a filamentous cyanobacterium isolated from oxidation pond of a regional textile mill was cultured in the lab using BG-11 medium with nitrogen supplement. Source, identification and culturing details have been described earlier [10]. 2.1.1 Hydrogen production in PBR by free cyanobacterium Seven day (7 d) old culture of free cyanobacterium was used for hydrogen production in 1-L capacity lab-scale photobioreactor (PBRfr) made up of borosilicate glass with a working volume of 0.9 L. A dense 7 d old culture of N. linckia (6 g dry wt/L PBR volume with Chl a concentration of 5.1 mg/L) was taken in the photobioreactor occupying 0.6 L volume to which 0.3 L BG-11 medium was added. Anaerobic conditions were created by sparging with the inert gas Ar in the beginning for 10–15 min to replace all the air in the reactor. The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 28 °C and illumination (3000 lx) was done from three sides with white fluorescent light. Light and dark cycles of 18/6 h were provided with intermittent stirring of the PBR at 100 rpm. The photobioreactor consisted of four parts; the hydrogen producing main reactor was connected to a vessel containing 50% KOH solution for absorbing CO2 produced by the cyanobacterium in the gas phase. The CO2 free hydrogen was further passed through a vessel (250 mL capacity; fitted with septum) containing water and a pinch of NaCl along with a few drops of HCl to absorb any moisture or alkaline vapors, and the gas in turn displaced water contained in the fourth vessel (1-L capacity), adopting the technique described by Pandey and Pandey [11]. After every 24 h gas sample was withdrawn through a gas tight syringe from the head space of the third vessel to analyze the concentration of H2 produced. Rate of hydrogen production was determined by injecting it in a calibrated gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with a 13× molecular sieve column, thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using nitrogen as a carrier gas. Temperature of the column was 75 °C while the injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 75 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Changes in Chlorophyll a and glycogen content of the culture were determined by hot extraction method [12] using methanol and by anthrone reagent method [13], respectively, at every 24 h. The experiment was terminated after 7 days, when the rate of H2 production declined substantially and the biological waste from the PBRfr was collected for sorption experiments. 2.1.2 Hydrogen production in PBR by immobilized cyanobacterium A dense 7 d suspension of live N. linckia (containing approx. 1.1 g biomass) was immobilized in alginate matrix. Cell suspension of N. linckia was mixed with sodium alginate and the suspension was dropped into CaCl2 solution through a syringe and small beads (3 ± 0.1 mm diameter) were formed [14]. Immobilized Nostoc beads were used in three parallel photobioreactors (PBRimm), which were run for 5, 15 and 25 days for hydrogen production. The design of the PBR was the same as described for that containing free cell. In each PBR, immobilized cyanobacterial beads occupied 0.6 L volume while the rest of the working volume (0.3 L) was filled by BG-11 medium. The reactor conditions were: pH 8.0, temperature 31 °C, light/dark duration 18/6 h and light intensity 3000 lx (provided by fluorescent lights from three sides) with intermittent stirring at 100 rpm. These conditions had been earlier optimized for enhanced hydrogen production rates of the cyanobacterium [10]. Argon was sparged at 0 d to create anaerobic conditions in the PBR for proper functioning of the oxygen sensitive enzymes, hydrogenase and nitrogenase, involved in hydrogen production. PBRimm-I was run for 5 d after which the rate of hydrogen production declined sharply. In PBRimm-II and -III, a supplement of glucose (20 mM) was given at 5 d. The PBR-II was operated up to 15 d when again the rate of hydrogen production declined sharply. In PBR-III, a second flushing with Ar was given at 15 d to restore the required anoxic conditions, and the reactor was run for 25 d after which the rate of production declined by about 50%. H2 produced in each PBR was quantitatively analyzed using gas chromatograph at 24 h interval. The biological waste in the form of spent cyanobacterial beads from the above PBRs was collected at 5, 15 and 25 d and used after washing for biosorption experiments."
3,Biosorption studies,"2.2 Biosorption studies 2.2.1 Immobilization of spent biomass from PBRfr The biomass waste at 7 days was collected from the PBRfr outlet tube by simple filtration, washed, oven dried at 80 °C for 24 h, and powdered. The powdered biomass was immobilized using sodium alginate and calcium chloride by entrapment method [9] to form beads (3.0 ± 0.1 mm), which were used as the biosorbent. 2.2.2 Optimization of column conditions Biosorption experiments were conducted in fixed bed glass columns of 2.5 cm internal diameter, having glass wool at the bottom and a 2 cm layer of glass beads (2 mm diameter) at the top, to provide a uniform inlet flow through the column. A known quantity of the biosorbent (immobilized biomass) was filled in the columns to obtain the desired bed heights (15, 20 and 25 cm) in different columns. A binary solution of chromium (20 mg/L) and RR 198 dye (100 mg/L), and single component aqueous solutions of cobalt (20 mg/L) and crystal violet (100 mg/L) were prepared, which were passed through three different columns in down-flow mode at different flow rates (3, 5 and 7 mL/min) using peristaltic pumps. Source, purity and nature of the dyes have been described earlier in our batch studies, which also showed that the optimum pH for maximum biosorption was 2.0 for both Cr(VI) and RR 198, while it was 3.5 for Co(II) and 8.0 for CV [6–9]. Therefore, we used a binary solution of Cr and RR 198 maintained at pH 2.0, which was run through a single column, while separate columns were run for biosorption experiments with Co (pH 3.5) and CV (pH 8.0). The pH of the feed solutions was maintained at desired value using 0.1 N HCl or 0.1 N NaOH, before it came in contact with the biosorbent in the columns. All experiments were carried out in duplicates. Breakthrough capacity was determined and BDST model was applied as discussed later along with the results. 2.2.3 Biosorption studies using spent immobilized biomass from PBRimm at different stages The spent cyanobacterial beads collected from the three PBRimm at 5, 15 and 25 d were used in packed-bed columns for biosorption of the two metals and dyes from synthetic solutions in continuous mode as described above. Column conditions that were optimized in the first experiment were used i.e. bed height (25 cm) and flow rate (3 mL/min). Concentrations of the residual metal ions were analyzed on Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu AA 6300) and that of residual dyes were determined spectrophotometrically (UV/VIS Spectro Scan 50V) by reading the absorbance at 523 and 590 nm for RR 198 and CV, respectively. Percent removal of each component by the immobilized spent biomass of the cyanobacterium was determined using Eq. (1) (1) Removal of metal / dye ( % ) = ( C 0 − C e ) / C 0 ∗ 100 where C 0 is the initial metal/dye concentration (mg/L) and C e is the residual concentration of the metal/dye (mg/L)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Hydrogen production in PBR,"3.1 Hydrogen production in PBR 3.1.1 Hydrogen production by free cyanobacterium in PBRfr Hydrogen production by free N. linckia ranged from 22 to 82 μmol/h/mg Chl a equivalent to 2.7–10.04 mmol/L/d PBR volume (Fig. 1 ) with average rates of 58.6 μmol/h/mg Chl a (equivalent to 7.17 mmol/L/d PBR volume) over 7-days operation of the PBR under ambient conditions. Rates of hydrogen production by the present strain are much higher in comparison to that of other cyanobacteria like Nostoc calcicola and Scytonema hofmanni reported to be 6.0 and 38.0 nmol/h/mg dry wt [15] and Lyngbya perelegans reported to be 18.9 nmol/h/mg dry wt [16]. Nostoc flagelliforme showed hydrogen production up to 84.2 μmol/h/mg Chl a in chemostat conditions [17], which was higher that of our strain used in free form under ambient conditions. The 18 h light/6 h dark cycles provided to the PBR permit synthesis of photosynthetic assimilates by the cyanobacterium in the light phase, which subsequently undergoes dark fermentation leading to release of H2. Alternate light/dark cycle helps in improving sustained hydrogen production as carbon dioxide is reduced to starch during light and the latter is converted into hydrogen gas, organic acids and alcohol under anaerobic conditions during dark [18]. Decline in concentration of glycogen in the cyanobacterial cells over 7 d of hydrogen production (Fig. 1) suggests that degradation of endogenous substrates is involved in the process of hydrogen production. The rate of hydrogen production diminished by 67–75% when glycogen level fell to 0.07 mg from an initial concentration of 0.3 mg/g concentration in the cells (Fig. 1). 3.1.2 Prolonged hydrogen production with immobilized cyanobacteria in PBRimm Extreme sensitivity of the hydrogenase enzyme to molecular oxygen, which is generated by the cyanobacteria by photosystem II in the presence of light, limits the evolution of biohydrogen, because production of H2 is usually for a very short period in oxygenic environment [19]. It is therefore, necessary to design an operating system that would ensure stable and long term hydrogen production. One of the recent approaches, for increased H2 production is cell immobilization in some suitable matrix and creation of anoxic environment, specially in case of filamentous cyanobacteria, in which breakage of filaments and structural degeneration normally occur due to agitation, resulting in decreased hydrogen production. Cell immobilization provides protection to enzymes mediating metabolic activities against environmental disturbances, thus enabling the cells to be used for longer duration [20,21]. Average hydrogen production by the immobilized cells in the PBR was found to be much higher (132 μmol/h/mg Chl a equivalent to 16.16 mmol/L/d PBR volume) than that by the free cells of Nostoc (58.6 μmol/h/mg Chl a) as observed during the initial 5 days (Figs. 1 and 2). Immobilization of microbial cells has often been found to be advantageous since it effectively separates the cells from the liquid phase and increases their mechanical stability. Effect of immobilization on facilitated hydrogen production has been reported mostly in unicellular microalgae [22,23]. However, there are only a few studies reporting hydrogen photoproduction in immobilized form [24,25]. In the alginate matrix which is a non-toxic low cost natural polymer [14], the organism is able to grow and cell density increases that help in more efficient light utilization by the cells [25]. Also, the polymerization process does not shift the pH inside the matrix and the pH of the alginate solution used is near neutral [25], which is optimal for cyanobacterial growth. During photosynthesis there is accumulation of carbohydrates, which is reserved as glycogen in cyanobacteria and it seems to play a role in biohydrogen production. In dark there is fermentation of endogenous carbohydrates accumulated during photosynthesis through a variety of fermentation pathways [26]. It was observed in the PBR with free cyanobacteria that there was decline in glycogen content as hydrogen production took place (Fig. 1). As the glycogen reserves degrade and deplete with time the hydrogen production efficiency of the cells in the PBR declines. Exogenous glucose supplement at 5 d in PBR-II and -III, therefore, restores hydrogen production in the reactors (Fig. 2 ). During the operation of the photobioreactor, oxygen seems to build up due to photosynthesis, thereby decreasing hydrogen production at later stages (15 d). Sparging with the inert gas Ar at this point, in PBR-III helps in restoring the anaerobic conditions and significantly increases the hydrogen production rates (Fig. 2)."
6,Biosorption studies,"3.2 Biosorption studies 3.2.1 Optimization of column parameters Adsorption of metals and dyes is dependent on the quantity of the sorbent in the column. The concentration–time profile or the breakthrough curves give important information for successful design of a column sorption process [27]. Breakthrough experiments were therefore conducted at different bed heights (15, 20 and 25 cm) while keeping the other conditions constant. Concentration of the metals and dyes was kept as 20 and 100 mg/L, respectively; pH was maintained 2.0 for RR 198 dye + Cr(VI), 3.5 for Co(II) and 8.0 for CV dye; and the flow rate was kept constant at 3 mL/min. Breakthrough curves were plotted between the concentrations of the metals/dyes in the effluent as a function of time (Fig. 3 a–d). It was observed that breakthrough time increased with increasing bed height for all the four pollutants which may be attributed to increase in number of binding sites broadening the mass transfer zone [28]. Also, greater volume of the solutions is treated with increased bed height leading to higher percent removal of the metals and dyes [29]. In comparison to the bed exhaustion time at 15 and 20 cm bed height, the value was much greater for all the sorbates at 25 cm bed height. Flow rate is an important parameter for evaluating the efficiency of sorbents in continuous treatment process of effluents. Effect of flow rate was studied keeping initial metal and dye concentrations constant at 20 and 100 mg/L, respectively, at a bed height of 25 cm, and varying the flow rate from 3 to 7 mL/min. Breakthrough curves for biosorption of metals and dyes on the N. linckia biomass at different flow rates are shown in Fig. 4 a–d. It was observed that breakthrough time decreased when the flow rate increased from 3 to 7 mL/min. As the adsorbate solution moves, adsorption zone also starts moving. After some time effluent concentration starts rising, this is termed as a breakpoint and the uptake capacity of the column at this stage is known as the breakthrough capacity. Breakthrough capacity of the packed cyanobacterial column was calculated as follows [30]: (2) Breakthrough capacity ( mg / g ) = breakthrough time × flow rate × initial metal / dye conc Mass of adsorbent in the bed Breakthrough time (t b) was taken as the time required by the effluent to reach the initial influent concentration C 0 (C 0M = 20 mg/L metal ions and C 0D = 100 mg/L dye concentrations). Flow rates significantly influenced metal and dye adsorption capacity by the biosorption column. At low flow rates the adsorption capacity was 15–18 mg/g for the metals and 53–65 mg/g for the dyes, which was much higher than corresponding values at higher flow rates, being 7–9 mg/g for metals and 32–41 mg/g for the dyes. Higher speed of adsorption zone at increased flow rate seems to provide insufficient time for the solute, thereby decreasing the biosorption. Greater adsorption capacity at low flow rates seems to be due to increase in residence time of the solute in the column and limitations on diffusion of the solute into pores of the sorbent at higher rates [31]. Both breakthrough point and bed exhaustion time were more for Co(II) as compared to Cr(VI). Adsorption capacity of the biosorbent was also slightly more for cobalt (18 mg/g) as compared to chromium (15 mg/g) at initial concentration of 20 mg/L. Out of the two dyes, the present biosorbent was found to be more efficient for biosorption of RR 198 dye as compared to CV dye as indicated by the breakthrough point, adsorption capacity and bed exhaustion time (Table 1 ). The spent biomass was however, quite suitable for biosorption of all the four sorbates from aqueous solutions. 3.2.2 Analysis of column data using BDST model The Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model is based on physically measuring the capacity of bed at different breakthrough values. The column service time was selected as time when the effluent metal/dye ion concentration reached 1 mg/L. Breakthrough curves were analyzed using BDST model. The BDST is a simple model for predicting the relationship between bed height, Z, and service time, t, in terms of process concentrations and adsorption parameters [32]. The model ignores the intra-particle mass transfer resistance and external film resistance such that the adsorbate is adsorbed on the adsorbent surface directly. With these assumptions the BDST model provides useful equations for predicting changes in system parameters [31]. Hutchins [33] proposed a linear relationship between bed height and service time given by Eq. (3); which was used in the present study: (3) t = N ∘ Z C i V − 1 K C i ln ( C i C b − 1 ) where C i is the initial metal/dye concentration (mg/L); C b is the breakthrough metal/dye concentration (mg/L); t is the time to reach breakpoint (min); N o is the sorption capacity of biosorbent (mg/L); Z is the bed height of column (cm); V is the linear velocity (cm/min) and K is the rate constant (L/mg/min). The plots of service time against bed height (Fig. 5 ) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min were linear indicating the validity of BDST model with high coefficient of regression (Table 2 ). Under constant experimental conditions iso-removal lines were plotted between service time and bed height for all the four pollutants. From the slope and intercept of respective iso-removal line, the adsorption capacity (N o) and rate constant of adsorption (K), were calculated which are shown in Table 2. The plot of service time against bed height at flow rate of 3 mL/min (Fig. 5) was linear (R 2 for Cr(VI) = 0.977, Co(II) = 0.986, RR 198 = 0.975 and CV = 0.968, respectively) indicating the validity of BDST model for the present system. The rate constant K calculated from the intercept of the BDST plot characterizes the rate of solute transfer from the liquid to the solid phase (Table 2). The computed K was 7.7 × 10−5–9.1 × 10−5 for metals and 2.9 × 10−5–3.0 × 10−5 for dyes. The value of rate constant of adsorption for the biosorbent is found to be rather small when compared to some other studies for removal of Cr(VI) by immobilized Spirulina platensis (K = 2.07 × 10−3 L/mg/h) reported by Gokhale et al. [34]; K = 0.081 L/mg/h, for removal of Co by Ulva reticulata in packed column reported by Vijayaraghvan et al. [35]; and K = 0.0116 L/mg/h for removal of Acid Green dye by Azolla filiculoides reported by Padmesh et al. [29]. A longer bed would therefore be more suitable to avoid breakthrough with the present biosorbent. Such considerations in BDST model parameters can be useful to scale up the process for other flow rates."
7,Metal and dye removal by multi-stage spent immobilized biomass from PBRimm,"3.3 Metal and dye removal by multi-stage spent immobilized biomass from PBRimm The ability of spent immobilized biomass from the PBRimm (5, 15 and 25 d) for the removal of two metals and dyes from aqueous solutions was studied and the data is presented in Fig. 6 a–d. The efficiency of removal was more for the 5 d reactor waste from PBR-I, as compared to that collected from the PBR-II (15 d) and PBR-III (25 d). Also the biosorbent removed the metal ions more efficiently than the two dyes. The 5 d waste biosorbent from PBR-I continued to remove 80% of Co and Cr up to 30 and 25 min, respectively, whereas removal of the same percentage of dye was for a shorter time that continued up to 8–20 min only. The biomass waste from PBR-II and PBR-III was relatively less efficient as these could remove 80% of the metals up to 10 min and 50% of the metals up to 30–40 min. In case of the dye 80% removal could be obtained only up to 4–8 min, while 50% removal continued up to 20–30 min. Bed exhaustion time was more in case of the PBR-I waste, being 550 min for the metals and 710 min for the dyes. Initial concentration of the dyes was higher and continued to be removed for a longer time by the column. A decline in the efficiency of metal and dye removal by the waste from PBR-II and -III, in comparison to that from PBR-I, can be attributed partially to gradual loss of mechanical stability of the immobilized cyanobacterial beads with time leading to increased compactness of the biosorption columns."
8,Conclusion,"Immobilization of the live cyanobacterium in alginate matrix significantly improved hydrogen production in the photobioreactor. Hydrogen production at average rate of 132 μmol/h/mg Chl a by the immobilized N. linckia biomass for a prolonged period of 25 days was achieved under optimized physico-chemical conditions in the PBR by maintaining required carbohydrate levels and anoxic environment. These were much higher than the average rate of hydrogen production by free cells (58.6 μmol/h/mg Chl a) over a period of 7 days. Biological waste from the PBRfr, immobilized and used as a biosorbent in packed-bed column for the removal of two metals (chromium and cobalt) and dyes (Reactive Red 198 and Crystal Violet) showed metal adsorption capacity of 15–18 mg/g and dye adsorption capacity of 53–65 mg/g under optimized column conditions (25 cm bed height and 3 mL/min flow rate). Application of BDST model to the biosorption data revealed linear relationship between bed height and service time. Biosorption efficiency of the spent immobilized biomass from PBRimm was found to be influenced by the duration of operation of the hydrogen photobioreactor. The 5 d reactor waste was more efficient as a biosorbent as compared to the 15 d and 25 d waste of the PBRs. The study opens new possibilities in coupling hydrogen production with wastewater treatment making use of locally available cyanobacteria."
