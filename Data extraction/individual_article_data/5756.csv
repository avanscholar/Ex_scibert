0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is employed as industrial raw material in many fields, especially in textile, paper, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), pharmaceutical and membrane industries (Thong et al., 2016). The corresponding wastewater often contains PVA, due to its high water solubility (Chaouat et al., 2008). PVA is difficult to be biodegraded (Hamad et al., 2014). In natural aquatic environment, PVA is persistent, and may promote the release of heavy metals from sediments into water (Hamad et al., 2014). In secondary wastewater treatment systems, the efficiency of PVA removal is usually low (Marušincová et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2017). Furthermore, the foam produced by PVA brings additional difficulties (Shan et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2005). Besides, the macromolecules of PVA will block the membranes when membrane technology is applied to the reclaiming of PVA-containing wastewater, which decreases the efficiency and increases the cost (Sun et al., 2013). Therefore, it is necessary to remove the polymers or break the long chains of the macromolecules in the wastewater before further treatment. Coagulation can remove some PVA, but there is still a lot of PVA left in the wastewater (Xing et al., 2012). For such water-soluble persistent organic polymer, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) should be a better choice (Sun et al., 2017). AOPs have been reported on PVA degradation, such as photocatalytic (Lin and Hsu, 2013), ionizing radiation (Ilčin et al., 2010), Fenton (Lin and Hsu, 2018), and ozone-hydrogen peroxide systems (Zimin et al., 2018). However, most AOPs generally perform effectively only under low pH conditions (Boczkaj and Fernandes, 2017). Furthermore, there are still problems such as the formation of precipitates (Sun et al., 2013), the relatively long reaction time (Lin and Hsu, 2013), and the consumption of large quantities of chemicals (Hamad et al., 2014). Ozonation is an important kind of AOPs that has been used extensively in water treatment, showing the advantages such as high oxidation potential of ozone (O3) and no residue left after treatment, but it also has some limitations such as the selectivity of degradation reaction and low ozone utilization efficiency (Ikhlaq and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2017; Peng et al., 2018). Therefore, heterogeneous catalytic ozonation technology has attracted much attention in recent years (Alver and Kılıç, 2018; Yuan et al., 2018), and the studies mainly focused on eliminating the above limitations of ozonation and improving the efficiency of oxidation, by adding appropriate catalyst to generate non-selective and highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals (Bai et al., 2016). However, there is still a lot of room for improvement for these studies, such as in decreasing the catalyst dosage, reducing the leaching of trace metals and improving the stability of the catalysts (He et al., 2018; Nawaz et al., 2017). Moreover, the application of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has seldom been reported in the degradation of PVA or other water-soluble persistent polymers. For this application, there are still challenges such as improving the efficiency and rate of degradation in a wider pH range, reducing the dosage of the catalyst, and improving the stability of the catalyst. In heterogeneous catalytic ozonation, supported catalysts are usually used (Zhao et al., 2014). Porous materials, such as metal oxides and molecular sieves, are often employed as supports (Chen and Wang, 2014; Ikhlaq and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2017). Some of the supports have also been proved to have catalytic effects themselves (Ikhlaq et al., 2015, 2012). Active components in the catalysts are usually transition metals or their oxides. Metals such as copper (Cu) (Deng et al., 2015), cerium (Ce) (Bing et al., 2013), and manganese (Mn) (Nawaz et al., 2017), have been studied. Among them, Cu is beneficial to the stability of the catalyst, and to the formation of surface hydroxyl groups, which are considered as the active sites on the catalysts and are critical for the formation of hydroxyl radicals. In addition, it has been reported that when Cu and other metals (e.g., Mn or/and Ce) are employed simultaneously, the catalytic performance can be further improved (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2015). In this study, to find an efficient, stable and rapid pre-treatment method which can break the long chains of PVA molecules in a wide pH range, heterogeneous catalytic ozonation was attempted. Supports and active components of the supported catalysts were screened, and the selected catalyst was optimized by improving the preparation conditions. Afterwards, ozonation with the optimal catalyst was further optimized. The possible mechanism of the ozonation was also discussed."
1,Material and methods,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents PVA (degree of polymerization: 1750 ± 50), metal nitrates and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). γ-Al2O3 was purchased from Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 280) was purchased from Nanhua Catalyst Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). All the reagents used were analytical reagents and without further purification. Deionized water was used for catalyst preparation and PVA degradation experiment."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation In this study, γ-Al2O3 and ZSM-5 were selected as alternative supports, while Cu, Mn and Ce were used as active components of catalysts. Among them, Cu was used as the key active component, and other two metals were used as the auxiliaries. The catalysts were prepared by ultrasonic-assisted incipient wetness impregnation method (Setiabudi et al., 2018). Taking γ-Al2O3-based catalysts as examples, copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) solution with certain concentration was introduced drop by drop onto γ-Al2O3 particles, which had been calcined at 500 °C for 1 h to remove impurities, to make sure that all the drops were absorbed by the particles. Then the particles were treated with ultrasonic vibration at 25 °C for 2 h, and then dried at 100 °C for 4 h. Afterwards, the samples were calcined in a temperature-programmed tube furnace at 500 °C for 3 h, with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min under air atmosphere, to obtain the CuO/γ-Al2O3 (CA) catalysts. Subsequently, the obtained CA was re-impregnated with cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3) or manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)2) solution, and the above processes were repeated under the same conditions, to obtain Cu–O–Ce/γ-Al2O3 (CCA) or Cu–O–Mn/γ-Al2O3 (CMA) catalysts, respectively. The ZSM-5-based catalysts were prepared using the same method. The screenings of supports and active components, as well as the preparation condition optimization, of the catalysts were evaluated based on PVA removal rate in the ozonation experiments (the dosage of the catalyst was 150 mg/L). Firstly, the catalytic performances of γ-Al2O3 and ZSM-5 loaded with Cu were compared, and the better support was determined. Subsequently, the effect of Ce or Mn doping on the catalytic activity of the selected support loaded with Cu was evaluated. Finally, the molar ratio of the selected active component to Cu (1:3–2:1), the loading rate of the transition metals (the ratio of the weight of the corresponding metal element(s) to that of the support, 0–11 wt%), and some key preparation conditions of the catalyst, including ultrasonic time (0–3 h), drying time (0–10 h), calcining temperature (300–600 °C) and calcining time (0–6 h), were optimized."
4,Degradation experiment,"2.3 Degradation experiment Schematic of experimental apparatus was shown in Fig. S1, batch reactions were conducted in 500 mL glass flasks at 25 ± 2 °C. In each flask, PVA solution (300 mL, initial PVA concentration = 20 mg/L, initial pH was adjusted with sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide to 7) and certain amount of catalyst particles were introduced. A magnetic stirrer was used to mix the suspension continuously at an agitation speed of about 150 rpm. Ozone generated via an ozone generator with oxygen as feed gas (YEK-S1000, Yierkang, China) was bubbled in the solution, through a glass aerator at 5.52 mg/(L·min). The reactor was linked to a tail gas absorption device, which equipped with potassium iodide solution. Water samples were taken from the flask through syringes at regular intervals, starting with O3 entry. After collection, the samples were bubbled immediately with nitrogen to remove the residual O3, and PVA concentration in the samples was analyzed. After the optimization of catalyst preparation, catalyst dosage (0–240 mg/L) and initial pH of the solution (pH = 4, 7, 10) were further optimized. Moreover, to examine the role of hydroxyl radical in catalytic ozonation of PVA, hydroxyl radical scavenging experiments were carried out. TBA is a commonly used hydroxyl radical scavenger (Zhu et al., 2017), and was employed in this study (60 mg/L). All experiments were conducted in triplicate."
5,Analysis and characterization methods,"2.4 Analysis and characterization methods Visible spectrophotometry (DR2800, Hach, USA) was used to measure PVA concentration by boric acid and I2/KI-iodide colorimetric method (Finley, 1961). Total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (TOC-5000A, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to analyze TOC in the solutions. Stirred ultrafiltration cell apparatus (Model 8200, Amicon, Millipore, USA) combined with TOC analyzer was used for the analysis of PVA molecular weight distribution, before and after treatment under the optimized conditions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for functional groups analysis of PVA. Iodometric method was used to determine ozone concentration in gas and water (Grunwell et al., 1983; Rakness et al., 1996). The optimized catalyst and the selected support (as a contrast) were characterized. The average particle diameter of the particles was measured by laser particle size analyzer (Bettersize, 2000; Bettersize Instruments Ltd., China). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were attained at −196 °C by accelerated surface area and porosimetry instrument (ASAP 2420, Micromeritics, USA). The BET surface area was estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the average pore diameter, pore size distribution and pore volume were determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The surface topography was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8020, Hitachi, Japan). Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained from a diffractometer (XRD, Empyrean, PANalytical B.V., Holland) using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA) in the 2θ ranges of 5–90°. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Escalab 250, Thermo Scientific, USA) was obtained using monochromatic Al-Kα radiation (15 kV, 150 W). The metal ions leached from catalysts into the solution were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS, AA-6880, Shimadzu, Japan). The point of zero charge (pHpzc) was determined by salt addition method (Mustafa et al., 2002)."
6,Kinetics model and statistical analysis,"2.5 Kinetics model and statistical analysis In this study, PVA degradation rates in sole and catalytic ozonation systems under different pH conditions were quantitatively compared. According to the preliminary study, pseudo-first-order kinetics model was used to calculate the degradation rates, and the model was expressed as Eq. (1) (Deng et al., 2015): (1) ln C/C0 = − k t, where, k (min−1) is the rate constant of reaction, while C and C0 (mg/L) refer to the concentration of PVA at time t = t (min) and t = 0, respectively. One-way analysis of variance was carried out to analyze the significance level of difference between two sets of data of degradation, using Origin (version 9.6, Originlab). The significance level was set to 0.05, and the difference was considered to be significant when P < 0.05."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Screening and optimization of catalysts,"3.1 Screening and optimization of catalysts 3.1.1 Screening of catalyst supports The effect of γ-Al2O3, ZSM-5 and Cu loaded γ-Al2O3 and ZSM-5 on PVA removal in the systems with or without ozone was shown in Fig. 1 . Without ozone, the effect of γ-Al2O3 or ZSM-5, or Cu loaded γ-Al2O3 or ZSM-5 on PVA was insignificant after 10 min of treatment (the removal rate of PVA < 4%). PVA removal in sole ozonation system was 33.4%, and with the presence of the particles, PVA removal increased to 55.5% (γ-Al2O3), 38.7% (ZSM-5), 58.6% (CA) and 54.0% (CuO/ZSM-5, CZ), respectively. Therefore, both γ-Al2O3 and ZSM-5 could catalyze the ozonation of PVA, but the performance of γ-Al2O3 was better. According to Ikhlaq et al. (2012), ZSM-5 can promote the surface reaction between adsorbed molecular ozone and the pollutant, while γ-Al2O3 can contribute to the decomposition of ozone and the formation of hydroxyl radicals. While PVA is considered to be degraded more effectively by hydroxyl radical than by molecular ozone (Sun et al., 2017). Therefore, γ-Al2O3 has a better performance. The doping of Cu improved the catalytic performance of both ZSM-5 and γ-Al2O3, and CA had a better performance. Therefore, γ-Al2O3 was selected as the support, and the subsequent optimizing experiments of catalysts were based on CA. 3.1.2 Screening and optimization of active components The performances of CCA and CMA in catalytic ozonation for PVA removal were compared in Fig. 2 . Similarly, without ozone, neither CCA nor CMA has significant effect on PVA (at 10 min, the removal rate of PVA < 3%). The presence of ozone increased the PVA removal rate to 60.5% and 73.7% after 10 min, and to 96.4% and 97.5% after 15 min of reaction, respectively. Although the removal rate of PVA in both CCA and CMA catalytic ozonation systems was higher than that in γ-Al2O3 or CA system at 15 min, only in CMA system, the removal rate was significantly better than that in γ-Al2O3 or CA system in the first 10 min (P < 0.05). It seems that the addition of Mn had a more significant effect on the performance of the catalyst than that of Ce. However, the results presented in Fig. 3 suggested that the positive effect of CMA should be attributed to the synergistic effect of both Cu and Mn, or all the three components (i.e., Cu, Mn and γ-Al2O3), as the effect of γ-Al2O3 loaded with Cu (the PVA removal rate was 58.6% (Fig. 1)) or Mn (56.6%) was similar. Meanwhile, it has been found that the effect of MnO2–CuO/Al2O3 on ozone decomposition is more significant than that of MnO2–CeO2/Al2O3 (Norsic et al., 2016), indicating there is a stronger synergy between Cu and Mn, than between Ce and Mn. In addition, Mn is cheaper and less toxic than Ce. Consequently, CMA was selected to conduct subsequent experiments. The effects of Cu/Mn molar ratio and loading rate on the performance of CMA were shown in Fig. 3. According to the results presented in Fig. 3a, after 10 min of reaction, the molar ratio of Cu to Mn with the highest removal rate of PVA (83.5%) was 1:2. The result showed the synergistic effect between Cu and Mn once again. This optimal molar ratio was similar to that reported by Huang et al. (2016), which was also effective in COD removal (88.6%, 60 min). The results presented in Fig. 3b showed that the loading rate with the highest removal rate (83.5%) was 4 wt%. Higher loading rate did not lead to a better catalytic performance, which may be due to the reduction of the specific surface area of the catalyst (e.g., the BET surface area of the catalyst decreased from 204.0 to 147.7 m2/g when the loading rate increased from 4 to 7 wt%), and similar anomaly of catalyst preparation has also been reported (Xu et al., 2016b). Moreover, the catalyst loaded with all the three metals (Cu, Mn and Ce), with the molar ratio of 1:2:2 and the loading rate of 4 wt%, was also tried, but the removal rate was not improved (only around 73.4%). Therefore, the CMA with molar ratio of Cu to Mn = 1:2, loading rate = 4 wt% was selected to conduct subsequent experiments. 3.1.3 Optimizing preparation parameters The effects of some preparation parameters on catalytic performance of the catalyst were shown in Fig. 4 . Ultrasonic impregnation time, drying time, calcining temperature and time did have some influences on the performance of the catalyst, but the influences were minor. According to the effects of these parameters, and the results in Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, the optimal catalyst was prepared as follows: Cu and Mn were loaded on γ-Al2O3 successively by ultrasonic impregnation method, and the molar ratio of Cu to Mn was 1:2 while the loading rate was 4 wt%; the particles were ultrasonic impregnated at 25 °C for 2.5 h, dried at 100 °C for 4 h, and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Similar catalyst preparation conditions were reported by Roshani et al. (2014), in catalytic ozonation of benzotriazole. Compared with those conditions, the impregnation time reported here was shortened significantly because of the aid of ultrasonic. The thus prepared catalyst was used in the following experiments. 3.1.4 Characterization of optimized catalyst Laser particle size analysis results showed that average particle diameters of γ-Al2O3 and the CMA were consistent (264.2 and 269.4 μm, respectively). The results of the BET analysis were listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. S3. According to the results presented in Table 1, the surface area of γ-Al2O3 decreased by 12.4% after the loading of Cu and Mn, the pore volume decreased by 8.4%, while the average pore diameter increased by 4.6%. The pore size distribution also indicated that the distribution was basically similar before and after loading (Fig. S3a). These results indicated that the loading of Cu and Mn blocked some of the micropores of γ-Al2O3, but the effect was minor. The reversible isotherm of both γ-Al2O3 and CMA were all type IV(a) of mesoporous materials with hysteretic loop in the range from 0.5 P/P0 to 1.0 P/P0 (Fig. S3b) (Thommes et al., 2015). According to the results of SEM (Fig. S2), the surface morphology of the two materials was also similar. Fig. S4 showed the XRD patterns of γ-Al2O3 and the CMA. Diffraction patterns of CMA were similar to those of γ-Al2O3, and only the intensity of the characteristic diffraction peaks was not so strong. No significant extra peak associated with Cu or Mn oxides was observed, implying that the Cu and Mn oxides in CMA were mainly amorphous. This might be due to the low loading rate and the high dispersion by ultrasound-assisted impregnation of Cu and Mn. The results also agreed with that Cu can prevent the formation of crystalline phase of Mn (Liu et al., 2018; Morales et al., 2008). The XPS spectra of γ-Al2O3 and CMA are presented in Fig. 5 a and Fig. 5b, respectively, and both spectrums contained Al, O, and C. Among them, the peak of C might be attributed to contamination caused by sample preparation and testing instrument (Yuan et al., 2018). Compared with pure γ-Al2O3, the content of O in CMA increased significantly, the O 1s peaks of both γ-Al2O3 and CMA were fitted into two peaks (Fig. 5c and d), whose binding energies were 529.4–530.4 eV and 531.2–531.9 eV, corresponding to lattice oxygen (Olat) and surface adsorbed species (Oads), respectively (Wang et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018). The estimated Oads and Olat ratio of CMA was higher than that of γ-Al2O3, and Oads was often considered to contribute to the formation of surface hydroxyl groups and improve the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst (Zhao et al., 2014). Cu and Mn were also detected in CMA (Fig. 5e and f). Cu 2p3/2 peaks located at 933.5 eV and 935.5 eV with a broad shake-up satellite near 941.2 eV, which was recognized as Cu (II) (Sable et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). There were three peaks in Mn 2p3/2, and the corresponding binding energies were 641.0 eV (corresponding to Mn (II)), 642.3 eV (Mn (III)) and 643.6 eV (Mn (IV)), respectively (Sun et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016). It has been reported that the presence of Mn with different valences in a redox system could enhance catalytic activity by promoting electron transfer (Sun et al., 2014). According to the results of pHpzc measurement, the pHpzc of γ-Al2O3 decreased from 8.4 to 7.9 after loading Cu and Mn. Studies have shown that the doping of transition metal can decrease the pHpzc of the support (Kyriakopoulos et al., 2010), and subsequently increase the surface polarity, which favors the adsorption of ozone (Alvárez’ et al., 2009)."
9,Optimization of catalytic ozonation,"3.2 Optimization of catalytic ozonation 3.2.1 Effect of catalyst dosage The effect of CMA dosage on PVA removal was shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in the figure, with the increase of catalyst dosage from 0 to 100 mg/L, the removal rate of PVA increased rapidly (P < 0.05) to 88.1%. Afterwards, the removal rate of PVA remained constant and even decreased slightly when the dosage was 240 mg/L. The phenomenon had also been observed in other studies, possibly due to the aggregation of particles (Kim et al., 2017), or/and the quenching of hydroxyl radicals due to the excessive active sites (Li et al., 2020). Therefore, 100 mg/L was selected as the optimal catalyst dosage. 3.2.2 Effect of initial pH The effect of initial pH values on PVA removal was shown in Fig. 7 . According to the results presented in the figure, initial pH of the solution had a significant effect on the removal rate of PVA in ozonation systems. In order to quantitatively compare the degradation rate of PVA by ozonation at different pH conditions, pseudo-first-order kinetics model (Eq. (1)) was used to fit the rate constants of PVA degradation. The estimated rate constants in different systems were listed in Table 2 . According to R 2 listed in the table, pseudo-first-order model was well fitted. For sole ozonation systems, the removal rate of PVA was fastest at pH = 10 (k = 0.12 min−1) and slowest at pH = 4 (k = 0.02 min−1). Under acidic conditions, it was difficult to generate hydroxyl radicals due to the low solubility and strong stability of ozone (Sun et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2018). While under alkaline conditions, hydroxyl ions could promote ozone decomposition to generate more hydroxyl radicals (Alver and Kılıç, 2018). The addition of catalyst could improve the degradation of PVA, and the order of the removal rate at different pH conditions in the catalytic ozonation systems was consistent with that in the sole ozonation systems. The rate constant of catalytic ozonation was 2, 4.6 and 2.6 times higher than that of sole ozonation at pH = 4, 7 and 10, respectively. This also indicated that the addition of catalyst could improve the ozonation efficiency more effectively under neutral conditions. When the solution pH was above or below pHpzc of the catalyst, the surface hydroxyls would be protonated or deprotonated, respectively (Stumm, 1992). Under neutral conditions, the solution pH was close to pHpzc (7.9), and the surface hydroxyls were mostly in the neutral state, which was considered to be conducive to the decomposition of ozone and the generation of reactive oxidation species (Afzal et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2018). The relatively limited PVA removal rate at pH = 4 (<pHpzc) should be ascribed to the decrease of neutral surface hydroxyls, as well as the inhibition of ozone decomposition in water under acidic conditions (Yuan et al., 2018). While at pH = 10, the PVA removal rate was higher than that at pH = 7, but this improvement should be attributed to the promotion of ozone decomposition by hydroxide ions (Staehelin and Holgné, 1982). At this pH, the activity of the catalyst was inhibited. One reason was the competition between hydroxide ions and the catalyst for ozone decomposition (Yuan et al., 2018). Another reason was the deprotonation of surface hydroxyls of the catalyst, which was considered to be adverse to the catalytic activity (Zhu et al., 2017). Under the optimal conditions of catalytic ozonation system, the removal rate of PVA was satisfactory at pH = 7 (97.8% in 15 min) and even better at pH = 10 (99.3% in 10 min). Although the removal rate was inhibited at pH = 4, it was still more than 60%. Therefore, compared with existing methods, such as Fenton treatments, the present method could be used in a much wider pH range. For example, when this method is applied to the treatment of neutral or alkaline wastewater containing PVA, such as centrifugal mother liquor and some pharmaceutical or dyeing wastewater, adjustment of pH is not required."
10,Possible mechanism of catalytic ozonation on PVA removal,"3.3 Possible mechanism of catalytic ozonation on PVA removal 3.3.1 Effect of hydroxyl radical on PVA removal The effect of TBA on PVA removal was shown in Fig. 8 . From the results presented in the figure, the addition of TBA inhibited the removal of PVA in catalytic ozonation systems significantly (P < 0.05), and the removal rate after 20 min decreased from 99.3% to 25.7%. It suggested that catalytic ozonation of PVA followed the hydroxyl radical reaction mechanisms. According to the results of XPS, the loading of Cu and Mn could increase the amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of γ-Al2O3, and Mn in the catalyst had different valences. More surface hydroxyl would enhance the interface reaction between ozone and the catalyst, and subsequently promoted the decomposition of ozone and the formation of more hydroxyl radicals (Alver and Kılıç, 2018; Xu et al., 2016b). Moreover, some other reactive oxidation species, such as O2•-, were also believed to be generated during this process (Zhang and Ma, 2008). O2•- was reported to promote the conversion among different valence states of transition metals on the catalyst surface and subsequently contribute to further generation of hydroxyl radicals (Xu et al., 2016a). Mn with different valences was considered to be helpful to promote catalysis through electron transfer, and the oxygen vacancy occurred in the process was replenished by ozone to form a cycle of electron transfer, which was also beneficial to the generation of hydroxyl radicals (Long et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2017). 3.3.2 Effect of catalytic ozonation on PVA molecules After catalytic ozonation, TOC content of the solution decreased from 10.97 mg/L to 9.49 mg/L, and the mineralization rate was only 13.5%. However, the results of PVA molecular weight distribution (Fig. 9 ) showed that the molecular weight of most PVA molecules was higher than 10000 Da (73.5%) before the reaction and lower than 3000 Da (75.8%) after the reaction. It suggested that the catalytic ozonation had changed the macromolecules of PVA into relatively small molecules (Hamad et al., 2014). The result of FTIR was shown in Fig. 10 , the intensities of stretching vibration of O–H (around 3400 cm−1) and C–H (around 1100 cm−1) decreased after 20 min of catalytic ozonation. Meanwhile, a new peak appeared at about 1710 cm−1, which corresponded to the stretching vibration of carbonyl group (CO) (Dong et al., 2019). Similar changes in FTIR spectra were also observed in the UV/chlorine system for PVA degradation (Ye et al., 2017). Therefore, in the catalytic ozonation system, more hydroxyl radicals were generated, and they attacked the carbon atoms more effectively. Subsequently, random chains scission occurred, the long chains of PVA molecules were broken into smaller pieces, and some hydroxyl groups were oxidized to carbonyl groups."
11,The performance of optimized catalytic ozonation,"3.4 The performance of optimized catalytic ozonation Under the optimal conditions, the removal rate of PVA reached 97.8% in 15 min at pH = 7, and 99.3% in 10 min at pH = 10. According to the results of metal leaching in CMA, the concentration of Mn in the solution was 0.026 mg/L (only about 1% of the Mn added), while Cu leaching was even insignificant (the concentration was lower than 0.005 mg/L), after 20 min of treatment at pH = 7. Meanwhile, the results of the catalyst reuse indicated that CMA maintained its catalytic activity after at least 5 cycles. After 5 cycles, the removal rate still remained 95.6% in 15 min at pH = 7. The catalytic ozonation changed the PVA macromolecules into relatively smaller molecules effectively, which was expected to improve the biodegradability of the wastewater, eliminate the problem of membrane blockage, and make the wastewater suitable for further treatment or reclaiming. To further evaluate the established catalytic ozonation system, some investigations of other AOPs on PVA degradation were compared in Table 3 . As shown in the table, although effective PVA removal can be achieved by the listed AOPs, each method usually has its own applicable conditions and limitations. UV-254 nm/TiO2 (Lin and Hsu, 2013) and visible light/S2O8 2− (Dong et al., 2019) systems need relatively long reaction time. The UV/H2O2 system (Hamad et al., 2014) consumes a large amount of H2O2, due to the relatively low UV absorbance of H2O2 (Rosenfeldt et al., 2013). Similarly, the Cu2+/O3 system (Tan et al., 2013) also has the cost problem caused by catalyst consumption, because it is difficult to recycle dissolved Cu2+ in the homogeneous catalytic system. Air-Fenton (Sun et al., 2013) and other Fenton-like (Lin and Hsu, 2018) systems can achieve a rapid degradation of PVA, but the production of sludge is a potential problem, which is also true for electrocoagulation technique (Chou et al., 2010). Moreover, these methods also have the problem of reduced removal efficiency at high pH, and the same is true for UV/chlorine (Ye et al., 2017) and IR/O3 (Sun et al., 2015) systems. In comparison, the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation system established in this study can degrade PVA effectively and rapidly in a wider pH range, the catalyst is stable, and the dosage of the catalyst is small. Furthermore, there are some systems similar to this study reported in recent years, for the removal of pollutants other than PVA, and three of them were also listed in Table 3. The Fe–Mn–Cu/γ-Al2O3/O3 system is effective for the degradation and mineralization of phenol (Wei et al., 2020). However, the removal rate of TOC decreased significantly with the increase of pH (about 35.7% decrease at pH = 12). Therefore, the effect of the catalyst has not been effectively showed under alkaline conditions. In both Mn/Cu-silica gel/O3 (Zhou et al., 2019) and Cu–Mn/Al2O3/O3 (Li et al., 2015) systems, the heterogeneous catalyst promote the degradation of target organic pollutants effectively. However, for the former, the degradation rate is slow, which takes 60 min to achieve 96% tricyclazole removal. While for the latter, a relatively large dosage of catalyst is required (4 g/L)."
12,Conclusion,"(1) The optimal conditions for preparation of the catalyst included: ultrasonic temperature = 25 °C, ultrasonic time = 2.5 h, drying temperature = 100 °C, drying time = 4 h, calcining temperature = 500 °C, calcining time = 4 h, Cu/Mn molar ratio = 1:2 and loading rate = 4 wt%. When the initial concentration of PVA solution was 20 mg/L, the optimal dosage of catalyst was 100 mg/L. (2) Catalytic ozonation with CMA was effective and rapid on PVA removal under both neutral and alkaline conditions, and the removal rate reached 97.8% in 15 min at pH = 7, and 99.3% in 10 min at pH = 10. (3) The degradation of PVA in the catalytic ozonation system followed the mechanism of hydroxyl radical reaction. After 20 min of reaction, 13.5% of PVA was mineralized, most of the long chains of PVA molecules were broken into smaller pieces, and some hydroxyl groups were oxidized to carbonyl groups."
