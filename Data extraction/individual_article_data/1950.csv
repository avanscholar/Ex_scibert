0,Introduction,"With rapid global industrialization and population explosion, energy deficiency and environmental deterioration are becoming unprecedentedly serious all over the world [1–3]. People are committed to searching clean energy, among which solar energy has attracted most attention [4]. Decomposition of water by photochemical reaction to generate hydrogen is assumed to be the most promising technology to utilize solar energy [5–7]. Various photocatalysts have been employed for solar-to-hydrogen conversion, including metal oxides [8–10], metal sulfides and nitrides [11,12], and non-metal conjugated polymers [13–15]. However, they are still far from industrial requirements. Therefore, designing and developing inexpensive but highly-efficient photocatalysts that split water to generate hydrogen by solar energy is a research focus in photocatalysis [16]. Significantly, graphitic carbon nitride as a conjugated polymer with two-dimensional layered structure, has a suitable bandgap (ca. 2.70 eV for g-h-heptazine phase) and extremely high chemical stability, but costs less [2,17]. It has been extensively studied for photocatalytic water splitting since the groundbreaking work in 2009 [18]. Unfortunately, in view of the fast recombination of photo-induced charges in g-C3N4, and the limited utilization of solar light as well, the performance of pristine g-C3N4 for hydrogen evolution is still quite low [2,19]. In this aspect, various techniques have been applied to improve the photoactivity including the regulation of nanostructure, construction of heterojunction with other semiconductors or incorporation with organic molecular to expand the π-conjugated system [17,20–24]. For example, Li and his colleagues developed aromatic rings-modified g-C3N4 nanosheets photocatalysts by co-condensation of urea and aromatic compounds [25]. The introduction of aromatic rings to g-C3N4 framework not only decreased the bandgap by modulating the electronic structure of the π-conjugated, but also enhanced the charge delocalization to accelerate charge migration. Based on this, 6-aminopyridine-2-carboxylic acid and 3-aminobenzoic acid were anchored onto g-C3N4 nanosheets through post-chemical modification. The larger π-electron delocalization of g-C3N4 photocatalysts exhibit superb photoactivity [26]. However, due to the existence of the hydrogen evolution overpotential, co-catalysts based on precious metals (Pt, Au or Pd) are essential for photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction [27]. Considering the high price of precious metals, all the catalysts obtained by the above modification methods still cannot be applied industrially. Therefore, it is extremely challenging but pressing to design a cheap and highly-efficient co-catalyst to achieve noble-metal-free photocatalytic hydrogen production. Recently, a variety of hydrogen evolution co-catalysts were reported to replace Pt for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, including metal phosphide (Ni2P, Co2P, NiCoP) [28–30], metal sulfide (CdS, WS2, MoS2) [12,31] and other metal-based derivatives ([FeFe]-H2ase) [32–36]. However, the preparation of the above co-catalysts is complicated, while their combination with g-C3N4 is not strong, resulting in poor stability and low activity. Obviously, it can be known from photosynthesis of green plants that chlorophyll as a photosynthetic active center is an Mg-containing porphyrin family molecule [37,38]. In view of this, it has been found that co-catalysts such as metal complex molecules and hydrogenases can be employed as hydrogen releasing sites [34,39]. After connecting with semiconductors through chemical covalent bonds or simple π-π conjugation, the obtained catalysts can generate hydrogen under solar light without Pt. As being reported, Ru (II) mononuclear or binuclear complexes were employed for CO2 photo-reduction containing sacrificial electron donors from water [35]. In our previous reports, transition metal complex molecular co-catalysts also were used for hydrogen evolution reaction in g-C3N4 photocatalytic systems [34,39]. It is easy to find that different oxidation states of the transition metal centers (such as M(I), M(II), and M(III)) can convert from each other easily [35,40,41]. Therefore, in the redox cycles between the different valence states of a metal, hydrogen is released from the metal active centers. The cycle process is similar to the role of Co-Pi co-catalyst in oxygen evolution, where the valence-change effect of Co active species can capture photo-generated holes and then promote the separation of photo-generated charge carries [42]. On the other hand, the redox property of a complex could be tuned using various ligands, so as to endow the metal complex with superior activity as a co-catalyst to decrease the over potential for hydrogen releasing [43]. However, to design a highly effective co-catalyst based on metal complex with robust covalent bonding to g-C3N4 is very promising but extremely challenging. In this work, we present a straightforward but effective method to develop a remarkable noble-metal-free photocatalyst for hydrogen production (Scheme 1 ). Briefly, thiophene embedded polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (TPCN) obtained by copolymerization of urea and 2-aminothiophene-3-carbonitrile (ATCN) serve both as a photosensitizer and a support. Secondly, a rationally designed nickel molecular complex (NiL2(Cl)2) prepared by bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2) serves as a co-catalyst [44,45], which acts as active species to release hydrogen. Moreover, thanks to the strong CN covalent bond between TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2 co-catalyst, NiL2(Cl)2 is extremely highly dispersed on TPCN framework with high loading content. Consequently, the obtained composite photocatalysts NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN exhibit superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 95.8 μmol h−1 with excellent stability, which is the highest value reported so far in noble-metal-free hydrogen evolution system."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Urea (CH4N2O, ≥99%) and N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99.5%) were acquired from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, ≥99.7%), tetrahydrofuran (THF, ≥99.5%), acetonitrile (CH3CN, ≥99%) and diethyl ether (Et2O, ≥99.5%) were attained from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Nickel (ΙΙ) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 98%) was purchased from Energy Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 2-chloromethylpyridine hydrochloride (C6H7Cl2N, 98%), 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HDBA, 97%), triphenylphosphine (PPh3, ≥95%), 2-aminothiophene-3-carbonitrile (ATCN, >97%), diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD, 97%) and triethanolamine (TEOA, 98%) were supplied by Aladdin Industrial Corporation Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was obtained by a pure water system (GWA-UN, Beijing, China)."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of CN and TPCN nanosheets Typically, to prepare thiophene embedded graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets, 20 g urea and 20 mg ATCN were directly mixed in 50 ml deionized water and then stirred at 80 °C to remove the water. The resultant solids were transferred into an alumina crucible completely wrapped with aluminum foil, and then calcined at 550 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 5.0 °C min−1. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained orange powders were washed and dried at 60 °C overnight. The harvested samples were denoted as TPCN. In comparison, pristine graphitic carbon nitride was prepared by direct thermal heating of 20 g urea at 550 °C for 4 h at the same ramping rate, and labeled as CN. 2.2.2 Preparation of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN hybrid catalysts To synthesize the hybrid catalyst, nickel molecular complex NiL2(Cl)2 was attached to TPCN nanosheets through CN covalent bonds by Mitsunobu reaction [46]. The preparation procedure for NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN is illustrated in Scheme 1. A corresponding possible chemical reaction pathway is depicted in Scheme S1. Briefly, 100 mg TPCN catalyst was completely dispersed in 40 ml THF by sonication. Then, different amounts of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HDBA, 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.50, 0.99, and 1.49 g) were added into the above suspension at 0 °C immediately. After that, triphenylphosphine (PPh3) with mole ratio of PPh3: HDBA = 1.2:1 was added and stirred for 30 min. And a certain amount (1.2 eq) of diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) dissolved in 20 ml THF was added to the above suspension with a rate of 2–3 drops per second. After being vigorous stirred for 24 h at room temperature, the solids were obtained after being washed three times with Et2O [46]. Subsequently, the dried samples were immediately re-dispersed in 60 ml CH3CN by sonication, and the corresponding amounts of 2-chloromethylpyridine hydrochloride (C6H7Cl2N, 0, 0.07, 0.33, 0.66, 1.31, and 1.97 g) were added into the dispersion [47]. Then, the suspension was transferred into a round-bottom flask and heated to reflux under nitrogen atmosphere for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered, washed three times with ethanol and deionized water, and then dried under vacuum oven overnight. The obtained catalysts were named as xL/TPCN (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Finally, the as-prepared xL/TPCN samples were re-dispersed in 40 ml DMF completely under sonication. And different amounts of NiCl2·6H2O (0, 0.05, 0.24, 0.48, 0.95, and 1.43 g) were dissolved in 20 ml DMF, and then dropped into the above suspension, respectively. After being stirred at room temperature overnight, the composite catalysts were obtained by filtration [48]. After being washed until the filtrate is clear and colorless, and then being dried under vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C, the obtained hybrid catalysts were marked as xNiL2(Cl)2/TPCN (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). 2.2.3 Preparation of NiL2(Cl)2/CN and NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN In addition, to demonstrate the key role of thiophene-ring in the plane of TPCN to promote photocatalytic hydrogen production, catalyst named as NiL2(Cl)2/CN based on unmodified CN was also prepared. However, in xNiL2(Cl)2/TPCN catalysts, NiL2(Cl)2 was covalently bonded to TPCN skeleton, and then Ni metallic active sites are directly integrated into the TPCN framework. For comparison, NiL2(Cl)2 was also simply loaded on TPCN surface following the same route without adding PPh3 and DEAD. The obtained sample was labeled as NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN. The detailed preparation conditions for the samples are listed in Table S1."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The phase structure of the samples was conducted using a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer. The surface chemical composition of the catalysts was recorded by a Thermo ESCALAB 250-X1 XPS. The morphology of the prepared samples was recorded with a Zeiss Merlin SEM at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV, and a JEM-2100F TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV with a Bruker X-Flash 5030 T X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer EDS. The optical absorption properties of the samples were recorded by a Hitachi U-3010 UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, Shimadzu IR Affiniy-1, Japan) spectra were recorded by mixing the samples with KBr pellets as the reference. A Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to record the Photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of the samples. Time-resolved fluorescence of the catalysts was detected on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 920 high-resolution spectrofluorometer and excited at 364 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermogravimetric analysis were performed by a Q600 SDT TA ING TGA under nitrogen atmosphere with a ramping rate of 10 ℃/min. The composition of the catalysts was measured by an Elementar Vario ELIII CHNSO element analyzer. Elemental contents of nickel species in the prepared catalysts were assayed by a PerkinElmer Optima 8300 ICP-OES."
5,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 evolution Photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out in a Labsolar III AG quartz reactor system with top-irradiation (Beijing, Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd). In brief, 50 mg catalyst was totally dispersed in 100 ml aqueous solution (H2O: TEOA = 9:1 vol%). After sonicating for 30 min, the suspension was put into a Pyrex reactor under continuous stirring. The reaction system was evacuated to vacuum before irradiation. After that, the reactor was irradiated by a 300 W PLS-SXE 300/300UV Xe arc lamp (Beijing, Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd) with an optical filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The average light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW·cm−2 which was determined by a PL-MW2000 spectroradiometer. The temperature of the reaction solution was controlled at 4 ℃ by circulating cooling water. To quantitatively analyze the gaseous reaction products, a GC 7806 online gas chromatography equipped with a TCD was used. In order to carry out cyclic test experiments, the evolved H2 was degassed after irradiation reaction for 3 h each time. Then, the next cycles were processed under the same conditions immediately. To discuss the wavelength-dependent photocatalytic performance of the catalyst, photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments were conducted in the same closed circulating system under different monochromatic light irradiation (cutoff with band-pass filters of λ ± 5 nm for 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 nm), respectively."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical properties of the prepared samples were performed using a three-electrode configuration in a quartz cell, assembly using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660C, Shanghai Chenhua, China). 0.5 M Na2SO4 buffer solution (pH = 6.5) was used as the electrolyte solution. The working electrode was prepared by dip-coating the dispersion of the catalysts (100 μL) on an FTO glass substrate (1 × 1 cm2). Then, the photocatalyst-modified FTO electrode was obtained after air-drying at room temperature overnight. The suspension was prepared by dispersing 5 mg catalyst in 1 ml ethanol containing Nafion solution (5 wt%, 50 μL) under sonication. The light source was a 300 W PLS-300/300UV Xe lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm). The steady state linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were measured from −0.2 to −1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were tested in acetonitrile with 0.05 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The periodic chopped light J-t curves were recorded at a constant potential of −0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 30 s). The Mott-Schottky plots were measured at −0.8 to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl at different frequencies of 900, 1800 and 3200 Hz, with an amplitude of 10 mV in the dark. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted within the frequency range from 106 to 10−2 Hz in the dark."
7,ICP-OES analysis,"2.6 ICP-OES analysis The as-prepared catalysts were pretreated by digestion with concentrated nitric acid. In detail, 10 mg powder sample was dissolved in 5.0 ml concentrated HNO3, and then sonicated for 15 min every 1 h. After reaction for 24 h, the mixture was diluted and filtered to 20 ml with deionized water before analysis."
8,DFT calculation,"2.7 DFT calculation To simulate the HOMO and LUMO of CN, TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN catalysts, DFT calculation was performed on Gaussian 09 program, using incremental Fock by default. Briefly, B3LYP and 6-31G (d, p) basis sets were performed and used in all DFT optimization. To simulate the experimental results qualitatively, the minimum trimmer unit cell with a pore is chosen as the calculation model. The optimized structure corresponds to the planar structure without any symmetry constraints."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology Pure carbon nitride CN was obtained from urea through calcination at 550 °C for 4 h [49]. Thiophene embedded polymeric carbon nitride TPCN was obtained by copolymerization with urea and π-electron rich monomer ATCN under the same conditions, as was detailed in the literature [26]. To disclose the reaction process during the synthesis of TPCN, TGA was carried out in nitrogen atmosphere. From the TGA and DTG curves (Fig. 1 a-b), one can see that urea shows two main decomposition temperatures at 233.2 and 382.3 °C, which is the process of the formation of tri-s-triazine ring from urea condensation. The result is consistent with what was reported in literature [2]. For the thiophene monomer ATCN, an obvious mass loss is observed in the range of 150.2–248.5 °C, which decomposes quickly and thoroughly as the temperature increases. It shows that ATCN is unstable and easily decomposes at high temperature. Fig. 1c displays TGA and DTG curves of urea-ATCN mixture. The thermal decomposition of the mixture exhibits four weight loss zones at 187.3, 319.7, 392.4, and 702.9 °C, respectively. The decomposition temperatures are different from that of urea, suggesting that the mixture of urea and ATCN undergoes different reaction route during the formation of TPCN. Upon temperature increasing, the urea-ATCN mixture presents rapid weight loss and further reacts to form TPCN catalysts. The above result indicates that TPCN is successfully obtained by the copolymerization of urea and ATCN [50]. In addition, it is found that the mixture of urea-ATCN does not completely decompose upon increasing the temperature up to 650 °C, which shows the stability of TPCN is significantly improved after introduction of ATCN. This is because of the enhanced delocalization of π-electron provided by the thiophene-ring, which stabilizes the entire CN skeleton and improves the thermal stability. According to the TGA analyses and previous reports [50], the formation process of TPCN is proposed and illustrated in Scheme S1. To analyze the phases of the catalysts, powder X-ray diffraction patterns of CN, TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN shown in Fig. 2 present two identical peaks, while XRD pattern of the co-catalyst NiL2(Cl)2 is shown in Fig. S1a. Take pure CN as an example, the (100) and (002) diffraction peaks are located at 13.1° and 27.8°, respectively [2]. The stronger one at 27.8° is associated with the periodic graphitic π-π interlayer stacking feature of the layers for conjugated aromatic system with a distance of 0.321 nm. The low-angle diffraction signal at 13.1° corresponds to the intralayer packing of heptazine units with a distance of 0.675 nm. Obviously, its XRD pattern matches well with previous reports (JCPDS 87-1526) [2,17]. Interestingly, upon the increase of loading contents of NiL2(Cl)2, the intensity of the (002) peak of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN decreases, while the diffraction of the (002) peak of TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN shifts from 27.8 to 27.5° compared with that of CN, indicating an increased interlayer distance from 0.321 to 0.324 nm. It can be attributed to the thiophene-ring embedded in the TPCN plane. Due to the π-electron rich property of the thiophene-ring, the interlayer π-π interaction force is enhanced and the insertion of sulfur atoms with larger radius and lone pair electrons further extend the interlayer distance [50]. For NiL2(Cl)2, there are several obvious diffraction peaks at 7.2, 12.5, 20.6, and 28.3°, some of which are overlapped with the diffraction peaks of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN (Fig. S1a). In addition, due to the low contents and high dispersion of NiL2(Cl)2 proved by the following results of ICP-OES, XPS and SEM, no characteristic diffraction peaks of NiL2(Cl)2 co-catalyst in NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are detected. However, ICP-OES result shows that the actual Ni contents increase with higher Ni dosages (Table S1). It proves that NiL2(Cl)2 is covalently anchored to TPCN framework successfully [27]. To demonstrate the functional groups of molecular structure, FT-IR spectra of CN, TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are recorded and displayed in Fig. 2. As represented in Fig. 2c, the broad peak in 2820–3480 cm−1 corresponds to NH and OH components. The absorption bands in the region 1150–1750 cm−1 come from stretching vibration characteristic of aromatic heterocycles [51]. The sharp peak at 813 cm−1 belongs to breathing vibration of the triazine rings [52]. FT-IR spectra confirm that the main skeleton of CN can be well maintained after introduction of thiophene-ring and NiL2(Cl)2 co-catalyst. Interestingly, while increasing the content of NiL2(Cl)2, several new absorption peaks at 1615, 1522, 1368, 1171, 1108, 993, 941 and 840 cm−1 are found (Fig. 2d), which can be determined as the corresponding characteristic peaks of benzene rings in NiL2(Cl)2 according to the FT-IR spectrum of NiL2(Cl)2 (Fig. S1b). It is concluded that NiL2(Cl)2 is successfully covalently bonded to CN framework. Moreover, ICP-OES result listed in Table S1 shows that Ni content of 3NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN is significantly lower than that of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, which indicates that the newly formed CN covalent bonds are helpful for the increase of the loading level of NiL2(Cl)2. Additionally, the intensity of the three peaks at 1575, 1408 and 1240 cm−1 becomes weaker upon increasing NiL2(Cl)2 contents. This can be ascribed to the decreased electron density because of the electron-withdrawing effect of metallic Ni active sites. The strong chemical bond with NiL2(Cl)2 quickens the transfer of photo-generated electrons from TPCN to metallic Ni active centers, thereby reducing the intensity of CN heterocycle vibration [34]. Fig. S2 shows the FT-IR spectra of comparative samples 3NiL2(Cl)2/CN, 3NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN and 3L/TPCN. The result also proves the above conclusion. The SEM images of the resultant catalysts all show typical ultrathin layered morphology and are closely stacked (Fig. 3 a-c) [53]. It is known that when used as a substrate, such ultrathin layered structure facilitates charge transfer and light absorption. Obviously, the main morphology of TPCN does not change after introduction of thiophene. Moreover, no apparently aggregated nanoparticles are found in 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, indicating that nickel complex content is low and uniformly distributed on the TPCN skeleton. TEM images of CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are displayed in Fig. 3d-f, showing their microstructures are in line with SEM observation. To analyze the elemental compositions and distribution in the catalysts, selected area EDS elemental mappings of TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN composite are depicted in Fig. S3 and Fig. 3, TPCN catalyst consists of C, N, O and S elements. Clearly, thiophene-ring is successfully introduced to the CN framework. EDX result of Fig. S4 shows a very low content of S (0.17 at%). For 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, as presented in Fig. 3h-m, C, N, O, S and low contents of Ni, Cl are homogeneously dispersed on the framework of TPCN. Among them, S and Ni, Cl are stemmed from thiophene-ring of TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2 co-catalyst, respectively. Consistently, the EDX spectrum of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN in Fig. S5 also shows the existence of S, Cl and Ni (0.35 at%). According to the EDS elemental mappings of Ni and Cl, it can be proved that NiL2(Cl)2 is homogeneously dispersed on TPCN, which can expose more metallic Ni active sites to generate H2. What is more, agglomeration of NiL2(Cl)2 active sites are avoided during the photocatalytic reaction and higher stability of the catalysts is ensured. The surface compositions and chemical valences of the obtained catalysts are investigated by elemental analysis (Table S2) and high resolution XPS (Fig. 4 and Figs. S6–S7). As listed in Table S2, the elemental composition of TPCN is not significantly difference from CN because the content of thiophene-ring is low. On the other hand, the C/N atomic ratio of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN (0.6999) is higher than that of TPCN (0.6715) and CN (0.6739) because the C content in NiL2(Cl)2 is higher. Obviously, the typical C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s peaks of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S7 [24]. A new peak of S 2p appears in TPCN, stemming from the introduction of thiophene-ring. Compared to CN, small amounts of S, Ni and Cl except C, N, O are detected in 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, which strongly confirms the existence of NiL2(Cl)2 and thiophene-ring. XPS spectrum of TPCN + Ni2+ shows no signal of Ni 2p, proving again that NiL2(Cl)2 is covalently bonded to TPCN (Fig. S6). Quantitative analysis of XPS shows the surface elemental composition of the catalysts (Table S3). CN has a C/N molar ratio of 0.7573, which is consistent with the value of ideal C3N4 (0.75). For TPCN, being embedded with thiophene-ring, the C/N molar ratio increases to 0.8018, and the content of S is 0.19 at%, which is consistent with the EDX result of 0.17 at% (Fig. S4). In addition, owing to the covalent bonding with NiL2(Cl)2, the C/N molar ratio of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN increases to 1.0204. The result is in line with elemental analysis (Table S2), indicating that thiophene-ring and NiL2(Cl)2 are introduced to CN successfully. High resolution XPS spectra provide more details of chemical states of the samples. Fig. 4a displays high resolution C 1s spectra, which can be fitted to two peaks at 288.4 and 284.8 eV. They are attributed to the carbons in NCN and CC/CC, respectively. The chemical shift of C 1s peak of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN is lower than that of CN and TPCN due to the introduction of NiL2(Cl)2. Meanwhile, there is a new peak at 286.1 eV for TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, corresponding to the CS/CO bonds [54]. The percentages of different C species are shown in Fig. S8a. The graphitic carbon (CC) in NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN increases a lot (from 6.89% to 25.11%) due to the existence of thiophene-ring and NiL2(Cl)2. Fig. 4b shows high resolution N 1s spectra, which exhibits four peaks centered at 398.9 (N2C, CNC), 400.1 eV (N3C, N(C)3), 401.3 eV (N1C, CNHx), and 404.5 eV (π excitation). Compared to CN and TPCN, the N 1s peaks of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN also show a slightly lower chemical shift, which is ascribed to the increase of electron density around 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, stronger shielding effect and faster charge separation caused by the incorporated NiL2(Cl)2 [55]. Obviously, more electrons and faster separation efficiency are beneficial to the reduction of protons to produce hydrogen. Fig. S8b presents relative ratios of the four N species, the content of NHx in TPCN increases from 8.93% to 10.14% in CN, which indicates that a thinner layer structure of TPCN. However, a lower NHx percentage in 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN (7.04%) was determined, which results from Mitsunobu reaction between amino groups of TPCN and hydroxyl groups of NiL2(Cl)2. The O1s spectrum (Fig. 4c) of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN features peaks at 532.7 and 531.6 eV corresponding to CO and CO/COC bonds, respectively [24], which are different from the peak of CN (532.4 eV, OH). High resolution spectra of S 2p are shown in Fig. 4d, which consists two peaks at 164.1(CSC) and 169.4 eV (CSOx C) [56]. The detected CO and CSC bonds respectively correspond to NiL2(Cl)2 and thiophene-ring. As shown in Fig. 4e, deconvolution of the Ni 2p spectrum of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN exhibits four peaks at 855.8, 861.7, 873.6, and 879.8 eV, which are sequentially originated from Ni 2p3/2, Ni 2p1/2 and their satellite peaks [57]. In addition, the twin signals at 200.00 and 198.4 eV of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN belong to Cl 2p1/2 and Cl 2p3/2 respectively are shown in Fig. 4f, which indicate the presence of [NiCl] coordination bonds in NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN hybrid catalysts [39]. In summary, XPS analyses further demonstrate the successful preparation of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN catalysts, and the co-catalyst NiL2(Cl)2 is combined with TPCN by robust CN covalent bonds."
11,Optical and photoelectrochemical properties,"3.2 Optical and photoelectrochemical properties Thiophene-ring embedded in CN framework can alter the optical properties and light harvesting ability. Fig. 5 a displays the UV–vis spectra of CN, TPCN, and xNiL2(Cl)2/TPCN series samples. The strongest visible light absorption is observed from the color variation of the samples (Fig. S9). Obviously, the color change is in line with the redshift in the UV–vis DRS [58]. For CN, the typical absorption edge of CN is 452 nm, which is corresponding to its bandgap. The intrinsic absorption band derives from π → π* electronic transition of the sp2 hybridization of C and N in the heptazine unit. After copolymerization with ATCN, TPCN shows significantly enhanced light absorption in UV–vis regions. Furthermore, in the region of 432–610 nm appears an obvious new absorption band. This is attributed to n → π* electronic transition of the lone pairs electron that from the electron-rich sulfur atoms and edge nitrogen atoms in TPCN [59]. What is more, the absorption intensity of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN in visible light region enhances with the increase of NiL2(Cl)2 concentration, which can be ascribed to the direct binding between TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2. The composite catalyst holds the advantages of (1) inhibiting recombination of photogenerated charges through fast transfer of electrons to NiL2(Cl)2 (an electron accepter), and (2) improving light harvest in the visible light region because of the enlarged π-electron delocalization [60]. Therefore, the introduced thiophene-ring and bonded NiL2(Cl)2 regulate the bandgap of CN and enhance the capture of visible light. To further disclose the role of thiophene-ring and NiL2(Cl)2, UV–vis DRS of NiCl2·6H2O, ATCN, 3L/TPCN, 3NiL2(Cl)2/CN, and 3NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN are recorded and depicted in Fig. S10. The absorption bands also strengthen the evidence for the presence of nickel complex NiL2(Cl)2 and covalent bonds in 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, which are in line with the FT-IR and XPS analyses. To evaluate the charge transport and separation efficiency of the as-prepared catalysts more profoundly, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CN, TPCN and xNiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are recorded and shown in Fig. 5b. For CN, it exhibits a strong PL emission peak at 442 nm, corresponding to the bandgap emission estimated by UV–vis spectrum (Fig. 5a). However, with the introduction of thiophene-ring, the PL intensity of TPCN reduces significantly and shows apparent redshift to 542 nm (inset of Fig. 5b), which is coincident with the UV–vis spectrum. Moreover, after grafting with NiL2(Cl)2, NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN displays lower PL emission peak intensity than TPCN and further redshift to 550 nm, suggesting that the bonding with NiL2(Cl)2 species plays a role in reducing the recombination between photo-generated electrons and holes [19]. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence spectra are illustrated in Fig. 5c. Due to the introduction of thiophene-ring, TPCN exhibits a minimized emission average lifetime of 3.45 ns compared to CN (5.80 ns). The introduced thiophene-ring acts as an electron trap center to improve the electron migration for the reduction of water to hydrogen immediately [20]. Particularly, 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN shows the lowest average decay lifetime of 3.35 ns due to the newly formed CN covalent bond, which is beneficial for the transfer of photo-generated electrons to the metallic Ni active centers to split water. Consequently, the introduced thiophene-ring and NiL2(Cl)2 accelerate the charge transfer kinetics of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN and significantly enhance its hydrogen production activity. In order to further discuss the charge migration kinetics during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, photoelectrochemical measurements were performed and shown in Fig. 6 . Time curves for the photocurrent response of the catalysts exhibit prompt photocurrent responses upon each illumination (Fig. 6a). It is clear that all materials present excellent photophysical stability, which is closely connected to the stability of photocatalytic hydrogen production [23]. It can be seen that 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN exhibits the highest photocurrent density (about three times that of CN). Undoubtedly, the increase of photocurrent density infers a more efficient separation efficiency of charge carriers, which matches well with the results obtained by PL and TR-PL. Fig. 6b shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots of CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN. Compared with CN and TPCN, the optimized sample 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN exhibits the smallest impedance arc radius. That is, the smallest charge-transfer resistance (Rct), [61] indicating that the covalent linking significantly enhances conductivity of the hybrid catalyst [35]. Particularly, for the reaction of water reduction to hydrogen, reducing the hydrogen evolution overpotential is an important factor [27]. In this case, linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) test of the as-prepared samples was carried out. The LSV curves of CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN catalysts are shown in Fig. 6c. Notably, the optimized sample exhibits much more pronounced cathodic current density and the lowest onset potential at 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, demonstrating the improved electron migration efficiency and faster reaction kinetics for water reduction [5,12]. In addition, it also indicates that the overpotential for H2 production at 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN reduced dramatically after linking with NiL2(Cl)2. The result is consistent with the hydrogen generation performance. Based on the discussion above, one can conclude that the NiL2(Cl)2 was successfully designed and served as an economical co-catalyst to replace Pt in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
12,Photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity In order to investigate the prominent influence of thiophene-ring and NiL2(Cl)2 on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Triethanolamine (TEOA) was used as a sacrificial reagent because of its high efficiency to remove photogenerated holes. As displayed in Fig. 7 a and d, under visible light illumination, TPCN does not show any hydrogen evolution activity. Once combined with NiL2(Cl)2, large amount of H2 is detected. The optimum hydrogen evolution rate attains to 95.8 μmol h−1 over 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN (Fig. 7a, c). Since Pt is a well-known co-catalyst for HER, the hydrogen evolution rates of pure CN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN with the addition of 3 wt% Pt under the same light irradiation were also examined. According to Fig. S11b, the hydrogen evolution rate of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN without Pt is almost 4 times of that of pure CN with Pt (26.4 μmol h−1), even reaching 82% of that of 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN with Pt (116.9 μmol h−1). The result indicates that it is practical to replace Pt with NiL2(Cl)2 in photocatalytic HER. As shown in Table S4, it is noted that the NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN hybrid catalyst exhibits the excellent hydrogen production activity among those reported noble-metal-free CN-based photocatalysts. For comparison, the comparative samples named as TPCN + Ni2+, 3NiL2(Cl)2/CN and 3NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN were examined and the result is shown in Fig. 7d and Fig. S11a. Among them, no hydrogen is detected on TPCN + Ni2+, while the hydrogen evolution rates of the reference samples 3NiL2(Cl)2/CN and 3NiL2(Cl)2@TPCN reach 29.2 and 16.4 μmol h−1, respectively. This means that NiL2(Cl)2 can produce H2 only when serving as a co-catalyst, and the covalent bonding of TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2 provides a significant promotion effect for hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, the result also reveals that thiophene-ring in TPCN framework significantly enhances the evolution of H2 by increasing the absorption of visible light and the transfer efficiency of the charge carriers [62]. But increasing the amount of NiL2(Cl)2 continuously (accurate content of NiL2(Cl)2 are shown in Table S1), the photocatalytic activity decreases rapidly. As reported, this is attributed to the excess NiL2(Cl)2, in which the metallic Ni active species will aggregate to form recombination centers to capture electrons and holes, resulting in lower photo-generated electron utilization [29,39]. In addition, the stability and recycling performance of the catalysts are depicted in Fig. 7b. It only exhibits a negligible decrease during the constant hydrogen evolution. Obviously, NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN displays excellent stability and reusability for photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen. Wavelength dependence of hydrogen evolution rates on 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN was also assayed (Fig. 7e). It is noted that the hydrogen evolution rates match well with its absorption curves, proving that the light absorption ability is a key factor for the photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the hydrogen evolution rate over 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN at 450 nm attains to 35.5 μmol h−1, and the calculated apparent quantum yield (AQY) is 6.68%. Further investigation on the structures and morphologies of the samples before and after photocatalytic reaction by XRD, FT-IR and XPS proves that the catalyst does not change, as depicted in Fig. S12 and Fig. S13. The experiments again confirm the high stability of the prepared NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN catalysts."
13,Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.4 Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution For the sake of discussing the mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, XPS valance band spectra and Mott-Schottky curves of CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN were recorded and shown in Fig. 8 . The bandgaps are calculated by the curves of (αhυ)2 versus hυ, which are 2.78, 2.34 and 2.25 V for CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN, respectively (Fig. 8a). XPS valance band spectra are shown in Fig. 8b. In general, the value calculated from VB to XPS can be attributed to the energy difference between the Fermi level and valance band maximum (VBM) [63]. Thus, the bandgaps of 2.41, 2.36, and 1.81 V (vs. NHE) for CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are obtained, respectively. Mott-Schottky curves (Fig. 8c) of CN, TPCN, and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN at frequencies of 0.9, 1.8 and 3.2 kHz reveals that they are all typical n-type semiconductors. The flat band potentials of CN, TPCN, and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are calculated to be −1.14, −0.84 and −0.86 V versus NHE (pH = 6.5), respectively. The flat band potential in aqueous electrolyte solutions can be approximated as the surface Fermi level.[64] Thus, the band structure alignments of CN, TPCN and 3NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN are summarized in Fig. 8d. Obviously, after copolymerization with ATCN, the bandgap of TPCN decreases by 0.44 V, indicating that TPCN has a broad light absorption range. The CB position corresponds to the LUMO energy level of tris-triazine, which consist of pz orbital. Therefore, the CB position of TPCN shifts from −1.51 to −0.82 V, which comes from the extended π-conjugated system by introduction of thiophene-ring [37]. Interestingly, the CB potential of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN is higher than that of TPCN (from −0.82 to −1.30 V), corresponding to a lower hydrogen evolution overpotential, which is thermodynamically more conducive to reduce proton to hydrogen [27]. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetry curve of NiL2(Cl)2 exhibits two reversible redox waves (Fig. S14), which are attributed to consecutive Ni(II)/Ni(I) and Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox processes [65]. The oxidation and reduction peaks at −0.35 and −1.67 V vs. Ag/AgCl are attributed to Ni(II)/Ni(I) [66]. According to the band structure alignment of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN in Fig. 8d, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN can migrate to the Ni active sites, resulting in the reduction of Ni(II) to form Ni(I), and then reducing H+ to H2 [58]. To further comprehend the role of NiL2(Cl)2 on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, DFT computations of CN, TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN were carried out and the result is presented in Fig. 9 . The result indicates that the LUMO of CN primarily originates from N p orbitals, whereas the HOMO mainly derives from hybridization of the C p and N p orbitals [37,67]. As to TPCN, the HOMO of the TPCN trimmer mainly locates at the ATCN segment while the LUMO mainly locates at the tri-s-triazine subunit, showing a more pronounced charge delocalization. The thiophene-ring with a lot of π electrons facilitates the delocalization of LUMO and HOMO of TPCN [50]. What is more, after being linked with NiL2(Cl)2, the LUMO and HOMO are mainly stemmed from TPCN and NiL2(Cl)2 framework. Namely, π-conjugated electrons are more likely to aggregate at the NiL2(Cl)2 segment, resulting in a wider π-conjugated system and higher charge transfer efficiency. As a result, higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate over NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN is achieved. Different from the traditional molecular photocatalysts that can be dissolved in solution easily, NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN can only be investigated in solid state. Combining our results with previous reports, a possible mechanism of the charge transfer and reaction processes in the photocatalytic hydrogen production is shown in Scheme 2 [35,40,68]. In the photocatalytic process, NiL2(Cl)2 serves as a highly active co-catalyst while TPCN is used both as a support substrate and a sensitizer for visible light capture. Electron transfer is efficient and most probably proceeds from TPCN framework to the nickel (II) co-catalyst. In other words, the photo-excited electrons and holes are generated from TPCN under visible light illumination. Then, the photo-excited electrons transfer to the NiL2(Cl)2 and reduce H+ to H2 immediately, while the photo-excited holes are quenched by TEOA. In detail, the photo-excited electrons in TPCN transfer to Ni(ΙΙ) active centers (covalently bonded NiL2(Cl)2). Ni(ΙΙ) is thus reduced to Ni(Ι) species, and then is protonated to Ni(ΙΙΙ)H intermediate which is highly active [68]. Therefore, Ni(ΙΙΙ)H transfers to Ni(ΙΙ)H immediately after capturing another photo-excited electron. Once combined with excess protons, Ni(ΙΙ) is recovered after releasing H2 [69]. Since the charge transfer kinetics from TPCN to NiL2(Cl)2 is very fast [35], it is difficult to observe intermediate states arising from the accumulation of Ni(Ι) during the photocatalysis processes. Above all, in such a mechanism, NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN acts as an efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution continuously."
14,Conclusion,"To conclude, we have successfully fabricated a noble-metal-free nickel molecular complex NiL2(Cl)2 modified hybrid photocatalyst NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN. Without any precious metals, the NiL2(Cl)2/TPCN hybrid photocatalyst exhibits outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (95.8 μmol h−1) and a notable AQY of 6.68% at 450 nm, both of which are much higher than most noble-metal-free CN-based hydrogen evolution catalysts [68,70–73]. This study highlights two key progresses. Firstly, the charge separation efficiency and light absorption are improved by introducing thiophene-ring to graphitic carbon nitride framework [26,74,75]. Secondly, a highly active nickel molecular complex NiL2(Cl)2 co-catalyst is successfully designed and covalently bonded to TPCN framework to reduce the overpotential of hydrogen evolution in water splitting [27,65]. This study provides a facile strategy to modulate the electronic structure of graphitic carbon nitride, and demonstrates a novel idea of designing noble-metal-free co-catalysts based on molecular complexes for hydrogen evolution [11], which exerts deep impact on solar-to-hydrogen conversion."
