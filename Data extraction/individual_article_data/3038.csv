0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is considered as a potential clean energy substitute for fossil fuels in the future because it has a high energy content, low emission and can be produced from renewable feedstocks [1]. Hydrogen can be produced by pyrolysis, electrolysis or bioprocesses using microorganisms. However, biological hydrogen production by fermentation/photosynthesis recently attracts a special attention due to environmental benefits, low energy requirement and low cost [22]. Among biohydrogen processes, fermentation is a promising route because it has a higher rate of H2 evolution in the absence of light. Fermentation also enables the H2 production from a wide range of potentially utilizable substrates including waste materials that facilitates waste recycling [21]. Moreover, fermentative microorganisms have a high growth rate and do not suffer much from inhibitory impact of oxygen in the system because the process is anoxygenic [2]. H2 fermentation at very high temperatures using hyper-thermophilic bacteria has been shown to be a potential process [3,18]. The feasibility of H2 production from renewable organic matter by hyper-thermophilic bacteria was indicated in some preliminary studies [4]. It is highly desirable to use minimal pretreatment of the raw materials and achieve maximum bioconversion to renewable energy sources [5,6]. Besides, operation of the dark fermentation process at extreme temperatures is favorable for the reaction kinetics and avoids contaminations by other H2-consuming bacteria. Some members of Thermotogales, an order of hyper-thermophilic eubacteria, have been considered as ideal organisms for the industrial bioconversion of waste to fuels because of very high H2 production from various carbohydrate-rich wastes [7–9]. A hydrogen yield on glucose of 4.0mol/mol, which is equal to the maximal theoretical value, was reported to be obtained with Thermotoga maritima MSB8, DSM 3109 [10]. Recently, reports on fermentative H2 production using thermophilic eubacteria Thermotoga have been published. Such organisms include Thermotoga neapolitana [11], Thermotoga elfii [12]. T. neapolitana was demonstrated to have a high consistent H2 production (25–30%) and tolerance of moderate oxygen amount (6–12%) in the gaseous phase of the batch reactor without apparent decrease in H2 content [11]. T. maritima and T. neapolitana have been studied for their potential to produce H2 [10,11] but their H2 production under various growth conditions has not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, we observed and quantified production of hydrogen as a byproduct of anaerobic fermentation by T. maritima and T. neapolitana in batch culture under different conditions of pH, temperature with the aim of optimizing the H2 production. Besides, we also studied the effects of various substrate concentrations and culture volumes on H2 production of two strains. The cells were also cultivated in media containing starch or cellulose to test the feasibility of hydrogen production on these feedstocks [19,20]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial species,"2.1 Microbial species The hyperthermophilic bacteria T. maritima strain DSM 3109 and T. neapolitana strain DSM 4359 were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Germany. At first, the freeze-dried strains were hydrated in 1.0mL of fresh culture medium, anaerobically kept in 1h at room temperature, transferred then anaerobically in serum bottles containing 20.0mL of fresh medium for cultivation."
3,Media for cultivation,"2.2 Media for cultivation T. maritima and T. neapolitana were routinely cultivated on the batch mode of 120-mL-serum bottles containing the T. maritima basal medium (TMB) with shaking. The TMB medium (signed as M1) used for cultivation of two strains was optimized by Yu Jiang et al. consisting of (amounts are in grams per liter of deionized water): 1.5g KH2PO4; 4.2g Na 2 HPO 4 · 12 H 2 O (22mM PO 4 3 - ); 0.5g NH 4 Cl ; 0.2g MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O (1mM); 27g NaCl; 4g yeast extract (YE); 1mL Balch's trace mineral solution [13]; 1mg resazurin; 40mL reducing solution. The reducing solution contained 200mL NaOH (0.2M); 2.5g Na 2 S · 9 H 2 O ; 2.5g cysteine HC · H 2 O [14]. Resazurin was used as a redox indicator. The final concentration of carbon sources including glucose, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose and cellulose was 0.5% (w/v). Another medium (called M2) was designed based on M1 with the following modifications: 15mL of the trace element solution (DSM-TES, see DSMZ medium 141) replacing for 1mL Balch's trace mineral solution and 1.0g/L of cysteine hydrochloride replacing for 40mL reducing solution. An amount of 1.0mL of mixture vitamin solution (thiamine hydrochloride, biotin, and B12, 40 μ g of each) [7] and 2.0mg NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O were added. The concentration of NaCl was used differently in 2.7% (w/v) for T. maritima and 2.0% (w/v) for T. neapolitana. The media were prepared under aerobic condition. After adding the reducing agent, the starting pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0 for T. maritima and 7.5 for T. neapolitana with 5N NaOH. Each 50mL of medium was dispensed into 120-mL-serum bottles stopped with butyl rubber stoppers, and sealed with aluminum crimp seals. The headspace of serum bottles was flushed with pure N2 in 5min for anaerobic atmosphere. The medium in the serum bottles was colorless and sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C in 20min. The culture temperature of both strains was 80°C with 1% inoculation."
4,Optimization of hydrogen production in batch fermentation,"2.3 Optimization of hydrogen production in batch fermentation The two strains were cultured at different temperatures ranging from 65 to 90°C and pH ranging from 5.5 to 9.0 for the optimal physical conditions. The hydrogen production of two strains was also studied with different volumes of culture medium to determine the effect of gas pressure on the cumulative hydrogen in the headspace of the closed bottles. Four different concentrations of glucose (5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 15.0g/L) and five different concentrations of YE (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0g/L) were used for investigation of hydrogen production under various concentrations of carbon sources. The hydrogen production with some different carbon sources including soluble starch, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and cellulose was also investigated."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Growth was monitored by dry cell weight (DCW) and optical density ( OD 600 ) with sterile media as the control. A relation between DCW and OD 600 was found to be: [ OD 600 ] = 0.3169 [ cell mass ] − 0.233 ( R 2 = 0.961 ) for T. maritima and OD 600 = 0.3768 [ cell mass ] − 0.4458 ( R 2 = 0.957 ) for T. neapolitana. Hydrogen gas in the headspace was sampled by a gas-tight syringe ( 100 μ L injection volume, Hamilton, USA) and determined by using a gas chromatograph (GC, Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2-m stainless column packed with Carboxen 1000, 50/80 mesh (Supelco). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 120, 70, and 120°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 55mL/min. Acetic acid was quantified by the same GC system as H2 measurement with a capillary Hewlett Packard Carbowax 20M column ( 30 m × 0.5 mm × 1.33 μ m film thickness) and a flame ionization detector. Temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were selected for the analysis: 230, 100 and 250°C with nitrogen as carrier gas at flow rate of 12.5mL/min. The residual glucose concentration in the medium was determined by using a glucose oxidase technique with BMI glucose-E KIT (BMI Company, Korea)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Simplification of the medium for cultivation,"3.1 Simplification of the medium for cultivation We cultivated T. maritima and T. neapolitana on M1 and our simplified medium M2 based on M1. The obtained result indicated that the TBM medium modified by Yu Jiang et al. [14] M1 and the simplified medium M2 gave the same growth. We selected M2 to cultivate two strains for further investigation because M2 kept enough anaerobic condition for cultivation with only a reducing agent (1.0g/L of cysteine hydrochloride). Moreover, M2 had a high buffering capability. The final pH in two batches using M2 was consistently within the range of 5.5–6.0 that had no inhibitory impact on growth of these strains. Due to the fact that T. maritima and T. neapolitana were the hyperthermophilic bacterial isolated from submarine regions, the culture media based on sea water for growth of these strains were usually very complex [7,8,15,23]. In this study, the medium M2 which was designed to culture both of the strains by using just KH2PO4, Na2PO4, YE and trace element solution was very cheaper and easier to prepare than the artificial sea water-based medium. This is one of great advantage to large-scale cultivations of these microorganisms."
8,Effect of temperature and initial pH on growth and hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of temperature and initial pH on growth and hydrogen production T. maritima and T. neapolitana were cultivated with shaking at 150rpm in an oil bath at the temperature range from 65 to 90°C. T. maritima gave the best growth and H2 production at 80°C but the optimal temperature of T. neapolitana was 75°C (Fig. 1 ). Both the cultures produced H2 after approximately 6–8h when entering the log phase of growth. The T. maritima achieved the highest level of H2 after 48h of cultivations longer than that in T. neapolitana only 36h. Hydrogen yield increased approximately two-fold higher at optimal temperature. At the higher temperatures, the bacteria showed shorter growth time from lag phase to the end of stationary phase (data not shown). T. maritima and T. neapolitana entered the late stationary phase after 52–60h at 65°C but at their optimal temperature, the growth time was 45–48h for T. maritima and 34–38h for T. neapolitana. The investigation of the growth and H2 production over the initial pH range of 5.5–9.0 at the optimal temperature of each bacterium were shown in Fig. 2 . When the initial pH level rose from 5.5 to 6.5–7.0, there was an increase in cumulative H2 production from 125 to 198mL H2/L medium. The increase of the initial pH in the range from 8.0 to 9.0 resulted in a decrease of in cumulative H2 production. The optimum initial pH values for growth and hydrogen production were 6.5–7.0 for T. maritima and 6.5–7.5 for T. neapolitana, respectively. The results showed a significant effect of different initial pH values on growth and hydrogen production of the bacterial. That implied that the pH control could stimulate the microorganisms to produce hydrogen. A previous research also indicated that the pH control is crucial to the H2 production because of the effects of pH on the hydrogenase activity [16]. At pH above 8.0, the cell mass was decreased so pH also have influence over other metabolism pathways of the bacteria."
9,Effect of substrates on growth and hydrogen production at the optimal temperature and pH,"3.3 Effect of substrates on growth and hydrogen production at the optimal temperature and pH In the optimal conditions of temperature and pH, T. maritima and T. neapolitana were grown in M2 containing a fixed YE concentration of 0.5g/L and different concentrations of glucose. The optimum H2 yield should be achieved with acetic acid as the main fermentative endproduct. The formation of reduced end products (e.g. ethanol, butanol, lactate, etc.) lowers H2 production, thus, the production of these end products should be avoided [2]. Investigation of acetic acid production during H2 fermentation was carried out to direct metabolism of the bacteria away from none-desired fermentation. Samples used for measurements of residual glucose and acetic acid were taken at the end of late stationary phase 45–48h for T. maritima and 34–38h for T. neapolitana after cultivation. At this time, content of H2 in both strains also reached the highest values. The results of the fermentation under various glucose concentrations are presented in Table 1 . The glucose in media with different glucose concentrations was not completely consumed during cultivation. At the initial glucose concentration of 7.5g/L for T. maritima and 10g/L for T. neapolitana, the glucose utilization shot up and increased insignificantly at higher initial glucose concentrations. However, the growth and H2 content of both strains showed the highest values of 2.37gDCW/L, 275mLH2/L medium for T. maritima and 2.44gDCW/L, 290mLH2/L medium for T. neapolitana at the initial glucose concentration of 7.5g/L (Fig. 3 ). Cell mass of bacteria sharply decreased when glucose concentration increased. At 15g/L of glucose, the growth was 0.67gDCW/L for T. maritima and 0.56gDCW/L for T. neapolitana, almost four-fold less than that at the optimal 7.5g/L of glucose. Obviously, high concentration of glucose had an inhibitory effect on growth in both of Thermotoga strains. In both T. maritima and T. neapolitana, there seems to have a given level of glucose utilization and it could be below 1.25%. The changes in cell mass under various initial glucose concentrations corresponded with the changes in H2 production. However, the effect of the initial glucose concentration on the acetic acid production was very distinct. It increased as glucose concentration increased from 10 to 15g/L. Medium M2 with 7.5g/L of glucose was used to study the effect of YE concentrations on the growth and H2 production (Fig. 4 ). The glucose utilization of two strains had a decrease when the increased YE concentrations were used. A considerable change in growth and H2 production was shown on the different conditions of YE concentration. In both T. maritima and T. neapolitana, the cell mass increased clearly when YE increased from 0.5 to 2g/L. The growth of the bacteria was almost insignificant at YE concentration of 2–6g/L. It appears that the YE concentration of 6.0g/L was the plateau level in growth of both Thermotoga strains. The H2 production of T. neapolitana clearly accelerated at the YE concentrations from 0.5 to 4g/L and probably achieved the saturated H2 level at YE concentration above 4.0g/L while the H2 production of T. maritima inclined to increase when YE concentration increased from 0.5 to 6g/L. An attractive result in this study was that at high YE concentration, T. maritima and T. neapolitana showed a very high H2 level, which was about 30–33% of total biogas in the headspace (data not shown). The effect of YE on H2 was different from on cell mass in both strains. The effect of YE on acetic acid production was similar with the effect of glucose. Acetic acid production increased when YE concentration increased. Therefore, YE was a essential component for the optimal growth of two strains, it is in agreement with the observations of previous studies [12,14]. The hydrogen yields in this study are 1.67molH2/molglucose in T. maritima and 1.84molH2/mol glucose in T. neapolitana. The hydrogen yield of 4molH2/mol sugar from T. maritima reported by Woodward et al. [17] was obtained under continuous nitrogen sparged condition and sucrose used as a substrate. Suellen et al. [11] investigated H2 production by T. neapolitana with hydrogen yield of only 0.53molH2/mol sugar with glucose as a substrate and batch fermentation condition. Therefore, as compared with some previous reports of studies on hydrogen production by Thermotoga strains, a higher hydrogen yield of the strain T. neapolitana was obtained in this study. The high H2 yields are associated with acetate fermentation product and low H2 yields are with propionate and reduced end-products such as alcohols, lactate, etc. Our study shows the hydrogen yields that are relatively lower than the theoretical value (4mol H2/molglucose) as well as low produced acetate concentration. These consequences may be because of that there are many metabolic pathways competitive with hydrogen formation during fermentation. Maximal hydrogen production rates of 10.0 and 2.7mmol/Lh, respectively, were previously reported on some strains Thermotoga [10,12]. These values obtained in our investigation were 8.2mmol/Lh in T. maritima and 8.7mmol/Lh in T. neapolitana. As compared to mesophilic anaerobes, these results show that hyperthemophiles still gained lower hydrogen production rates [4]. For high hydrogen yields with hyperthermophile, we need to improve this parameter."
10,Effect of culture volume on growth and hydrogen production at the optimal temperature and pH,"3.4 Effect of culture volume on growth and hydrogen production at the optimal temperature and pH In spite of the higher tolerance for high hydrogen level in hyperthermophiles, this product may still impose feed-back inhibition. A high level of produced hydrogen will make the metabolic reaction thermodynamically unfavorable [2]. This parameter directly depends on the ratio of culture volume to total vial volume. We used 120-mL-serum bottles to investigate the effect of culture volume on growth and hydrogen production. The results were shown in Fig. 5 . The culture volume had a more tremendous impact on H2 production than the growth. At 8.3% of cultivation volume (10mL medium in 120-mL-serum bottle), the bacterial cell had a very high H2 product rate of 883mLH2/L medium in T. maritima and 890mLH2/L medium in T. neapolitana. The H2 production gradually decreased as the culture volume increased. This experiment also enabled an observation the tolerance capability of accumulative hydrogen of T. maritima and T. neapolitana. The increase in culture volume made the level of accumulative H2 rise. At 41% of volume (50mL medium/120mL bottle), the accumulative H2 level achieved 31.6% of the total biogas in the headspace for T. maritima and 33% for T. neapolitana and the total H2 content obtained was the highest. Although the accumulative H2 at 50% of volume (60mL medium/120mL bottle) showed a higher level of approximately 39% but there was no increase in total H2 content and cell mass was also decrease. Therefore, the most suitable ratio of medium volume for H2 production is about 30%."
11,Hydrogen production from complex carbohydrates including in starch and cellulose,"3.5 Hydrogen production from complex carbohydrates including in starch and cellulose Hydrogen production by T. maritima and T. neapolitana was tested in M2 using soluble starch or CMC or cellulose as a carbon source with the supplementation of 0.5g/L of YE. Because YE is a good source of both carbon and nitrogen, we had to use a very low concentration of YE in this experiment for prevention of the growth depending on this substrate. In our case, both T. maritima and T. neapolitana could grow and produce H2 from fermentation of all tested substrates. The strain showed very much lower H2 levels such as 39–49mL H2/mL culture from cellulose than those from CMC (172–175mLH2/mL culture) and soluble starch (345–404mLH2/mL culture) (Table 2 ). Pretreatment of cellulose is required for hydrogen fermentation with high H2 yield."
12,Conclusion,We designed a simplified and economical medium from TMB medium. A consistent accumulation of more than 30% hydrogen was obtained by cultivating the bacteria in the medium using 7.5g/L of glucose and 4.0g/L of YE with using 31.6% of liquid medium. These are the appropriate concentrations of carbon and nitrogen source in the medium and the suitable ratio of medium volume supporting the growth and hydrogen production of these hyperthermophilic bacteria. The capability of using complex carbohydrates such as starch and cellulose to produce H2 was observed. The H2 level from fermentation of those substrates was not higher than that from glucose but the capability is the considerable potential to enhance the economic feasibility of the waste treatment combined with production of bioenergy in future. The hydrogen production from fermenting cellulose or starch or waste materials contain those compounds by T. maritima and T. neapolitana can be optimized and applied in industrial scale. Hyperthermophilic bacteria are very attractive for new biotechnology because of possessing highly thermostable enzymes. The biological processes using hyperthermophilic bacteria at extreme temperatures show some important advantages for technical applications. They are prevention of contaminations and cost saving for cooling. The members of the order Thermotogales demonstrated the ability of hydrogen production with high yield by using polysaccharides and lingo-cellulose from renewable organic matter. This fact provides inexpensive energy generation with simultaneous waste treatment that makes these strains more important in technical processes of hydrogen production in the future.
