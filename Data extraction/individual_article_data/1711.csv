0,Introduction,"Anaerobic fermentation has been extensively used for the treatment and energy utilization of organic wastes, such as animal wastes [1], municipal solid waste [2], and wastewater [3], to generate biohydrogen or biomethane. Biohydrogen is a renewable and clean energy source, with an energy density up to 142 kJ/g [4]. Nevertheless, the relatively low energy conversion efficiency (ECE) currently restricts deployment and commercial application of biohydrogen production via anaerobic fermentation. In order to improve the ECE and waste disposal capacity, single-stage dark hydrogen fermentation can be coupled with anaerobic digestion (AD) using hydrogenogenic effluents, which contain abundant residual energy in the form of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The cascading two-stage system incorporates an acidifying hydrogen production stage and a subsequent methanogenesis stage. Dark hydrogen fermentation is a biological process in which organic substances, such as saccharides and proteins, are degraded into hydrogen and VFAs via hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) under anaerobic conditions. Enterobacter aerogenes is one of the most studied hydrogen-producing strains [4]. E. aerogenes ZJU1, the HPB used in this study, is a strain of E. aerogenes that was mutated by nuclear irradiation via 60Co γ-rays [5]. The selected E. aerogenes ZJU1 mutant possesses a high hydrogen production capacity and stable inheritance. During the AD stage, residual soluble organic matter and VFAs in the hydrogenogenic effluent can be utilized to produce methane. This two-stage fermentation system has been tested in many laboratory studies, in which fermentative hydrogen and methane cogeneration was achieved using various feedstocks, such as algae biomass [1], food waste [6] and wastewater [3]. To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic limits of the microbial anaerobic fermentation reaction, it is required to improve biological activity and strengthen electron transfer of the fermentative microbes. Recently, some studies have found that biohydrogen production can be effectively improved through dosing metal or metallic oxide nanoparticles (NPs), such as Fe0, Ni0, Fe2O3 and NiO NPs, because they probably enhanced the bioactivities of ferredoxin oxidordeuctase and hydrogenase and electron transfer of HPB [7–9]. For example, Lin et al. has reported that dark hydrogen fermentation can be effectively improved with addition of ferric oxide NPs using E. aerogenes [10]. These researches have demonstrated the availability of metal-based NPs on improving single-stage fermentative hydrogen production, though the thorough analysis and substantial evidences on enhanced mechanisms of pure cultured HPB were deficient. Additionally, NPs added in the single-stage hydrogen fermentation effluent have scarcely been recovered and further applied in the AD process to promote methane production. The addition of NPs within the methane-producing AD system could accelerate methane production, probably because they are conducive to the establishment of direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) connections between exoelectrogenic bacteria and electron-accepting methanogens [11–14]. Moreover, it has been reported that electron-donating bacteria prefer to use short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or alcohols, and that means DIET would not be readily triggered by conductive materials (CMs) for macromolecular organics, such as polysaccharides and proteins [11]. This obstacle can be effectively relieved by coupling acidifying fermentation and the anaerobic digestion process in this study. Magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) are a material with high electro-conductivity that is 106 times greater than that of hematite NPs [11]. Additionally, conductive MNPs (~20 nm) potentially can be internalized by bacterial cells, thus facilitating their interaction with intracellular electron transfer system (ETS). Since previous studies demonstrated that metal oxide NPs, such as Fe2O3, TiO2 and ZnO NPs, can be accumulated inside of cells as well as interact with intracellular substances through physical, chemical or biological mechanisms [10,15,16]. Moreover, MNPs can be effectively recovered by means of magnetic separation, thus allowing for their reuse [17]. Several studies have shown the positive effect of magnetite on bio-hydrogen production [18–20]; however, the influences of MNPs on E. aerogenes have yet been reported. More importantly, the systematic studies on the responses of intracellular electron transfer chain associated with hydrogen production to MNPs are lacking. With regard to the AD process, magnetite has been demonstrated to effectively promote DIET between syntrophic partners in methanogenic systems [13,17,21,22]. Nevertheless, most of these studies are directed at the single-stage AD process, for instance, Yin et al. performed electrochemical and metagenomic analysis of microbial community in the presence of ferroferric oxide during single-stage methanogenesis [22]. In the two-stage hydrogen and methane co-generation system, the feedstock, CMs and a portion of bacteria used in the second-stage AD inherited from the effluent of the first-stage fermentation. The effect of CMs on microbial electron transfer and syntrophic metabolism in this case remains to be addressed. Furthermore, previous studies found that some CMs can stimulate the secretion of certain electrochemically active extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) during AD, such as c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts) [14,23]. EPS are generally regarded as natural macromolecule polymers excreted by microorganisms, which can participate in the syntrophic metabolism such as DIET due to the presence of redox active groups [23,24]. Nevertheless, there are few reports focused on comparing the contributions of conductive MNPs and EPS on extracellular electron transfer capacity of microorganism and the influence of MNPs on electrochemical characteristic of EPS. In this study, adding various concentrations of MNPs into a cascading dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion system was expected to facilitate microbial electron transfer for improving fermentative hydrogen and methane production performance. The primary purpose was to systematically elucidate the effect of MNPs on microbial electron transfer and syntrophic metabolism. Therefore, the effects of MNPs during the two-stage anaerobic fermentation were investigated via: i) observing the micro-topography of MNPs and E. aerogenes ZJU1; ii) determining the concentrations of soluble metabolic products (SMPs), the value of NADH/NAD+, and the activity of hydrogenase and ETS during dark fermentation; iii) evaluating the contributions of MNPs and EPS induced by MNPs to the extracellular electron transfer capacity of methanogenic microbes; iv) analyzing the shift in methanogenic microbial communities and pathways after the addition of MNPs."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and materials,"2.1 Inoculum and materials E. aerogenes ATCC13408, purchased from the Chinese Common Microbe Bacterial Preservation Administration Center and mutated by nuclear irradiation by 60Co γ-rays, was used in as inoculum for the dark hydrogen fermentation stage. The mutated strain was named E. aerogenes ZJU1 [5]. The culture medium and method for E. aerogenes ZJU1 were described in the Supplementary material. The methane-producing microorganisms used during the AD stage were enriched from the methanogenic activated sludge (MAS) sourced from an industrial CSTR AD reactor in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. The domestication and separation method for methanogens have been previously outlined by Xie et al. [25]. MNPs (magnetic Fe3O4 NPs; purity: 99.5%; diameter: ~20 nm) purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co. Ltd. were used as the additive to fermentation systems. Additionally, glucose purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China served as the substrate for fermentation."
3,Fermentation methods,"2.2 Fermentation methods 2.2.1 First-stage dark hydrogen fermentation 1 mL E. aerogenes ZJU1 seed medium was inoculated into 100 mL LB medium and cultured at 37 °C in a constant temperature shaking incubator at 180 rpm for 12 h. Then 1 mL cultured E. aerogenes ZJU1 solution was added into 100 mL fresh LB medium, and incubated in the constant temperature shaking incubator (37 °C, 180 rpm) for an additional 10 to 12 h to the mid-logarithmic growth phase. After that, 100 mL E. aerogenes ZJU1 culture was added in dark fermentation batch reactors (glass bottles) containing 200 mL culture medium (see Supplementary material) [25]. The pH of the fermentation broth was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.2 with 6 M NaOH and HCl solutions. MNPs were added into five batch reactors at concentrations of 0, 100, 200, 300, 500 mg/L, and each treatment was conducted in triplicate. Each batch reactor was sealed with a rubber stopper and then purged with high-purity nitrogen gas for 10 min, after which each bottle was placed in a constant temperature water bath at 37 °C to conduct hydrogen fermentation. After initiating the dark fermentation, gas samples were taken every 12 h and analyzed with a gas chromatograph (GC) until the end of hydrogen fermentation. 2.2.2 Second-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) Hydrogenogenic effluent mainly contains SMPs (e.g. ethanol, acetate and propionate) and residual glucose, both of which can be further utilized by methanogens to produce methane. The MNPs added during the first dark fermentation stage can be reused during the second AD stage to facilitate methanogenesis, thereby further increasing the total energy conversion efficiency (ECE). By the way, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was used to observe the morphology of MNPs at the end of hydrogen fermentation to ensure that the small-size characteristic of MNPs can be remained. After the first-stage fermentation, the recovery and reuse steps of MNPs are as follows: i) MNPs were separated from hydrogenogenic effluent using neodymium magnets of 4020 gauss [17]; ii) the separated MNPs were dried and weighed to calculate the recovery rate; iii) the volume of hydrogenogenic effluent and MAS required in the AD stage were calculated based on the principle that total volatile solids (TVS) ratio of original substrate to inoculum of 1: 2 [25] and total working volume of 300 mL; iv) after calculation, 215 mL of hydrogenogenic effluent and 85 mL of MAS were added to fermentation bottles containing the recycled MNPs. After the recovery of MNPs and hydrogenogenic effluent and the inoculation of MAS, the pH of the fermentation broth in each bottle was adjusted to 8.0 ± 0.1. Each fermentation bottle was sealed with a rubber stopper, and purged with nitrogen gas for 10 min and then placed in a constant temperature water bath at 37 °C for second-stage AD. Gas samples were taken at regular intervals and tested with a GC to calculate the methane yield and production rate until the end of the AD."
4,Analysis method,"2.3 Analysis method 2.3.1 Microbial surface morphology analysis The surface morphology of the fermentative microorganism samples (E. aerogenes ZJU1 and mixed methanogens) was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi SU-8010, Japan) after treating with gold spray. Sample preparation has been described in previously published literature [26]. SEM-EDS can be employed to observe the microscopic distribution of MNPs surrounding bacterial cells and the connecting relationship between MNPs and cells. SEM-EDS utilized high-energy electron beams to characterize the contents and distributions of elements within micrometer range. The impurity elements introduced during the spray-gold treatment process, such as Au and Ni, were deleted during EDS analysis. 2.3.2 Measurements of hydrogenase, ETS activity and NAD+/NADH concentration E. aerogenes ZJU1 samples in the presence of different concentrations of MNPs (0, 200 and 500 mg/L) were collected at 36 h and 48 h of hydrogen fermentation to determine hydrogenase activity. The hydrogenase activity was quantified by the amount of hydrogen produced from the Na-dithionite reduced methyl viologen catalyzed by hydrogenase released from per gram of dry weight lysed cells per hour [5,27], and the detail test procedures were described in Supplementary material. ETS activities of E. aerogenes ZJU1 added with 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs were tested with the 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride-electron transport system (INT-ETS) method [22]. And the concentrations of NAD+ and NADH of E. aerogenes ZJU1 amended with 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs were obtained using the NAD+/NADH Assay Kit with WST-8 (Shanghai Beyotime Biotech Co., Ltd., China), and the detail steps can be found in manufacturer’s instructions. 2.3.3 Excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra analysis Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of MAS was extracted after the second-stage AD using a modified heat extraction method based on previous studies [24,28–30], and the detail protocols can be found in Supplementary material. Three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (3-DEEM) spectra of EPS samples were acquired by a fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba JY Aqualog). The emission (Em) wavelength ranged from 250 to 500 nm in 4.48-nm increments and the excitation (Ex) wavelength varied from 200 to 500 nm in 5-nm intervals, and the scanning rate was 1200 nm/min. In the 3-DEEM spectra of EPS, the following five regions can be recognized according to the Ex/Em wavelength: simple aromatic proteins, such as tyrosine (Region I); tryptophan-like matters (Region II); fulvic acid-like substances (Region III); soluble microbial by-products (Region Ⅳ); and humic acid-like substances (RegionⅤ) [31]. The abundance of these dissolved organic matters in EPS can be presented as a percent fluorescence response (Pi,n ) [31,32], and the computing method was described in Supplementary material. 2.3.4 Electrochemical measurements The cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment was performed using a single-chamber three-electrode electrochemical cell (detail information was documented in Supplementary material) to evaluate the electron transfer capacity of biomass during AD [22]. Amounts of 50 mL methanogenic slurry from reactors treated with 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs were transferred into the electrochemical cell at the end of AD. The cell was sealed and then was purged with nitrogen gas for 10 min. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the CV curves were tested employing an electrochemical workstation (IVIUM, Tianjin Brillante, China). The scanning potential ranged from −1.2 V to 1.2 V (versus Ag/AgCl), and the scanning rates were taken as 25–200 mV/s. The apparent electron transfer rate constant (kapp ) can be obtained as per the Laviron equation [33]. To assess the contributions of conductive MNPs and EPS on the electrical conductivity of the MAS, a three probe electrical conductance measurement device was used to test the conductivities of MAS [34]. The methods of sampling, testing, parameters setting and calculating were described in Supplementary material. Additionally, a chronoamperometry (CA) measurement was employed to evaluate the electron acceptor capacity (EAC) and electron donor capacity (EDC) of EPS solutions, and the specific testing method were described in Supplementary material. 2.3.5 High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis Microbial communities in MAS were analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Five mL of samples were taken from the original MAS inoculum and the MAS after the second-stage AD treated with MNP concentrations of 0 and 200 mg/L. Phosphate buffer was used to rinse the samples, which were then centrifuged for 10 min in a high-speed centrifuge. The subsequent sediments were taken for DNA extraction using the OMEGA Kit (E.Z.N.ATM Mag-Bind Soil DNA Kit), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification; agarose gel electrophoresis; DNA purification and recovery; and DNA library sequencing preparation were all performed according to the previous study [35]. Sequencing was subsequently carried out on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The sequence data were analyzed by MR DNA (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined as a set of sequences clustered at 97% similarity. Finally, OTUs were taxonomically classified using BLASTN against a curated database derived from the RDP [35]. 2.3.6 Other analysis The contents of the gases produced from the two-stage fermentation process (mainly H2, CH4 and CO2) and SMPs contained in hydrogenogenic effluent (including ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate and isovalerate) were measured by the methods documented in Supplementary material."
5,Experimental data calculation and analysis,2.4 Experimental data calculation and analysis The calculation of kinetic parameters and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) for hydrogen and methane production was provided in the Supplementary material. Statistical analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was performed using Origin 8 software to evaluate the impacts of adding MNPs on experimental results. It can be considered that there is a statistically significant difference at P value < 0.05.
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphological effects of MNPs on E. aerogenes ZJU cells,"3.1 Morphological effects of MNPs on E. aerogenes ZJU cells Fig. 1 displays the surface distribution of carbon, oxygen, iron and sodium elements in the E. aerogenes ZJU1 culture treated with 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs. The location of the carbon element was basically the same as that of bacteria whether or not MNPs were added, since carbon is the basic element of organisms. In the absence of MNPs, the iron element was evenly distributed throughout the scanning area with low content, which mainly from the trace ferrous salts contained in the culture medium. In the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs, iron element was concentrated in the varying sized bright aggregated particle regions (as indicated with yellow arrows), and oxygen element also densely distributed in these regions; hence these particles were recognized as the aggregates of MNPs. These MNPs aggregates (tens to hundreds of nanometers) can attach to the surface of E. aerogenes ZJU1 cell. Previous study indicated that similar agglomeration of MNPs on the surface of the bacteria can be observed when immobilizing Clostridium beijerinckii with MNPs [19]. The MNPs attached to the cell surface potentially interacted with membrane structure proteins, especially membrane-bound hydrogenase. During the hydrogen fermentation, these MNPs are likely to involve the synthesis of active site of hydrogenase by providing ferrous element as well as accelerate the electron transfer to hydrogenase. Moreover, MNPs may also pass through the cell membrane into the interior of the bacterial cell to assist intracellular electron transfer process. Zhao et al. reported that zinc oxide NPs can enter the interior of Escherichia coli cells without breaking the cell wall [10,36]. Yang et al. proposed that zero-valent iron nanoparticles potentially can accelerate the electron transfer between ferredoxin and hydrogenase inside the cell of hydrogen-producing bacteria [37]. Moreover, SEM images of E. aerogenes ZJU1culture show that there are plenty of holes ranging from a few to tens of nanometers in diameter on the surface of bacterial cells treated with 500 mg/L MNPs (Fig. S6). This result could be attributed to an excessive concentration of NPs, which have toxic effects on cells, resulting in oxidative stress that damages the cell wall [7]."
8,Effects of MNPs on hydrogen production pathway and hydrogenase activity of E. aerogenes ZJU1,"3.2 Effects of MNPs on hydrogen production pathway and hydrogenase activity of E. aerogenes ZJU1 The SMPs in hydrogenogenic effluent mainly included ethanol, acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate and valerate (Fig. 2 A). Ethanol (16.1–20.7 mM), acetate (23.6–33.7 mM) and butyrate (18.3–22.9 mM) were the most abundant SMPs. The acetate concentration in the hydrogen fermentation effluent treated with 200 mg/L MNPs (33.7 mM) was 38.1% higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05); the butyrate concentration decreased from 22.7 mM to 20.6 mM; the ethanol concentration decreased from 16.5 mM to 16.1 mM; and the total SMPs increased from 76.1 mM to 82.1 mM. Results indicated that the acetate pathway of E. aerogenes ZJU1 was significantly enhanced with addition of 200 mg/L MNPs, whereas the butyrate pathway was possibly weakened. It was reported that the conversion of 2 mol of Acetyl-CoA (intermediate products of glucose degradation) to 1 mol of butyrate consumes 2 mol of NADH, whereas the conversion of Acetyl-CoA to acetate does not consume NADH [10,38]. Hence the shift from the butyrate pathway to the acetate pathway could provide more NADH, which can serve as an electron carrier to realize hydrogen formation by coupling proton reduction ( NADH + H + → NAD + + H 2 ) [38]. Moreover, the acetate concentration in the hydrogenogenic effluent treated with 500 mg/L MNPs was 23.6 mM, which was 3.3% lower than that of the control group; the butyrate concentration (18.3 mM) decreased by 19.4%; and the ethanol concentration increased by 25.5% to 20.7 mM. Therefore, the excessive MNPs weakened the acetate and butyrate pathways of E. aerogenes ZJU1 and could lead to the decrease in hydrogen yield. The concentrations of NAD(H/+) have significant impacts on hydrogen production of E. aerogenes, since the NADH-dependent hydrogen production pathway is one of the fundamental hydrogen production approach [39,40]. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, the concentrations of NADH of E. aerogenes ZJU1 increased from 4.14 ± 0.43 μmol/g DW to 5.07 ± 0.29 μmol/g DW in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs (P < 0.05), and the ratio of NADH/NAD+ increased from 1.02 to 1.32, which may be attributed to the regulation of MNPs on NADH related metabolic pathways, such as the shift from the butyrate pathway to the acetate pathway, by altering fermentative electron flows. Researchers proposed that NADH ferredoxin oxidoreductase (NFOR) can convert NADH into NAD+ and e−, and then the generated electrons are utilized for reducing H+ to H2 catalyzed by hydrogenase located in the inner membrane [39,41,42]. In this study, the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio in the reactor added with 200 mg/L MNPs will be favorable for hydrogen production. The hydrogenase activities of E. aerogenes ZJU1 treated with various concentrations of MNPs during 36–48 h of the hydrogen fermentation were shown in Fig. 2C and D. At 36 h of hydrogen fermentation, the hydrogenase activities of E. aerogenes ZJU1 treated with 200 and 500 mg/L MNPs were 130.2 ± 5.9 mL/(g-DW·h) and 163.1 ± 7.6 mL/(g-DW·h), respectively, which is an increase of 13.7% and 42.4%, respectively, relative to the control group. This result indicted that the enhancement effect of MNPs on hydrogenase activity obviously increased with the concentration of MNPs at 36 h of hydrogen fermentation. The increased hydrogenase activity can be related to the fact that the ferrous ions released from MNPs can participate in the synthesis of active site of hydrogenase. Moreover, MNPs attached to bacterial cell surface potentially can interact with membrane-bound hydrogenase to facilitate electron transfer of hydrogenase. Additionally, previous research indicated that hydrogenase activity can be affected by redox potential, thus MNPs can indirectly regulate hydrogenase activity by changing the NADH levels which related to redox potential [43]. At 48 h of hydrogen fermentation, it was observed that the hydrogenase activity of E. aerogenes ZJU1 treated with 200 mg/L MNPs was 178.0 ± 6.9 mL/(g-DW·h), which was 21.8% higher than the control group. Conversely, the hydrogenase activity of E. aerogenes ZJU1 added with 500 mg/L MNPs (99.6 ± 6.2 mL/(g-DW·h)) decreased by 31.8% comparing to the control group. This result can be attributed to the excessive MNPs or iron ions gradually infiltrating into the bacterial cells, causing oxidative stress that destroys the cell wall structure. SEM images (Fig. S6) show that numerous pores appeared on the cell wall of E. aerogenes ZJU1 treated with 500 mg/L MNPs. The destruction of cell wall structure exerted a negative impact on communication with the extracellular environment and bacterial metabolic activity, thus lowering hydrogenase activity."
9,Enhanced intracellular electron transfer of E. aerogenes ZJU1 with MNPs,"3.3 Enhanced intracellular electron transfer of E. aerogenes ZJU1 with MNPs The effect of MNPs on ETS activity of E. aerogenes ZJU1 was studied using INT-ETS method. ETS exists in all respiring microorganisms, including aerobic and anaerobic organisms, and its activity is an effective indicator for the intracellular electron transfer-relevant metabolic activities, such as cell respiration and redox reaction catalyzed by dehydrogenase [44,45]. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the maximum ETS activity of E. aerogenes ZJU1 (0.432 ± 0.031 μg/mL·min) was obtained in the reactor added with 200 mg/L MNPs at 48 h of dark fermentation, which is 29.7% higher than the control group. It can be found that the ETS activities of E. aerogenes ZJU1 treated with 200 mg/L MNPs were always higher than the control group during 36–60 h of hydrogen production, suggesting that the ETS activity was enhanced with the addition of MNPs. This result could be ascribed to MNPs involving in intracellular electron transfer associated with the synthesis of hydrogen, such as the electron exchange between NFOR and hydrogenase, due to its surface and quantum size effects and excellent conductivity. This study verified the enhanced intracellular electron transfer effect of MNPs."
10,Biohydrogen production with E. aerogenes ZJU1 affected by MNPs,"3.4 Biohydrogen production with E. aerogenes ZJU1 affected by MNPs E. aerogenes can produce hydrogen through two pathways. The first is the formate decomposition pathway, in which formate can be converted to hydrogen catalyzed by formate dehydrogenase (FHL). The second is the NADH pathway, in which hydrogen can be produced through reducing H+ with NADH produced during glycolysis [27]. The effects of various concentrations of MNPs on fermentative hydrogen production with E. aerogenes ZJU1 are shown in Fig. 4 . The hydrogen yield of the control group without MNPs was 215.4 ± 4.3 mL/g glucose. Addition with 100 and 200 mg/L MNPs increased the hydrogen yield to 243.8 ± 6.4 and 260.9 ± 6.3 mL/g glucose (P < 0.05), respectively. When the concentration of MNPs was increased to 300 and 500 mg/L, the hydrogen yield decreased to 232.3 ± 16.3 and 196.7 ± 4.8 mL/g glucose, respectively. The maximum hydrogen production rate (10.1 ± 0.4 mL/g glucose/h) was obtained in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs at 48 h of fermentation. The above results indicate that the addition of 200 mg/L MNPs had the best enhancement effect on fermentative hydrogen production for E. aerogenes ZJU1. The hydrogen yield and peak hydrogen production rate were 21.1% and 31.6% higher, respectively, than those of the control group. The improved hydrogen production with MNPs can be mainly attributed to the increase in NADH/NAD+ ratio and hydrogenase activity, which can directly result in the enhancement in NADH-dependent hydrogen production pathway. Additionally, in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs, the metabolic pathway of E. aerogenes ZJU1 shifted from the butyrate pathway to the acetate pathway, which can favor the increase of NADH/NAD+ ratio, thus it can be an indirect cause for facilitating hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the increased ETS activity with MNPs implied the improvement in the level of intracellular electron transfer-related metabolism, which had potential benefits for improving hydrogen production rate. However, the hydrogen production declined in the presence of high MNP concentrations, which is mainly related to the decreased hydrogenate activity. In addition, with the treatment of 500 mg/L MNPs, there were nano-scaled holes appeared on the surface of E. aerogenes ZJU1 cells resulting from the toxic effects of excessive MNPs, which may have negative effect on bacterial metabolic activity. Besides, the ethanol pathway of E. aerogenes ZJU1 enhanced, whereas the acetate and butyrate pathways weakened, which would increase the consumption of NADH and potentially had unfavorable effect on NADH-dependent hydrogen production."
11,Biomethane production from hydrogenogenic effluent affected by MNPs,"3.5 Biomethane production from hydrogenogenic effluent affected by MNPs The hydrogen fermentation effluent contained unconsumed glucose and liquid-phase metabolic by-products that can be further digested for methanogenesis, thereby improving the utilization efficiency of the feedstock and the total ECE. Furthermore, MNPs added during the hydrogen fermentation stage can continue playing a vital role during the methanogenesis stage by promoting DIET of methanogenic microorganisms. In view of the low loss rate of MNPs (<0.3%) during the hydrogen fermentation stage and high recovery rate of MNPs (>97.4%) before the start of second AD stage, it was believed that MNPs added at the beginning of hydrogen fermentation can basically remain the same concentration after fermentation stage, and most of them were reused in the second AD stage. Following 84 h of hydrogen fermentation, the enriched MAS was inoculated to produce methane. The effects of MNPs on methane production from hydrogenogenic effluent are shown in Fig. 5 . The methane yield of the control group without MNPs was 241.7 ± 6.1 mL/g, with the peak methane production rate (19.7 ± 1.1 mL/g/d) obtained on day 10 of the second-stage AD. The methane yield after adding 200 mg/L MNPs reached 297.0 ± 6.2 mL/g, which was 22.9% higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The corresponding peak methane production rate was increased by 26.4% to 24.9 ± 0.7 mL/g/d. The methane yield and production rates obtained after adding 100, 300 and 500 mg/L MNPs were all higher than those of the control group, though inferior to those of the group treated with 200 mg/L MNPs. The increased biomethane production performance can be mainly ascribed to the enhanced interspecies electron syntrophy between bacteria and methanogenic archaea in the presence MNPs. Recent studies indicated that CMs like iron-based NPs and carbonous materials can work as an electron conduit for DIET between syntrophic microorganisms to boost the biomethane yield and production rate [46]. Especially, nano-scaled Fe3O4 material exhibited high potential to facilitate DIET in syntrophic methanogenesis due to the presence of numerous active sites [46,47]. Besides, CMs are likely to interact with the EPS of microorganisms and enrich certain EPS compounds, such as protein and humic substances, which can act as redox mediators to benefit interspecies electron syntrophy [23,24,48]. It can be observed that the highest methane yield was obtained in the 200 mg/L MNPs treated group. This result was caused by the different levels of glycolysis and acidification that occurred during the first-stage dark fermentation due to the different additive dosage of MNPs. The content of acetate (33.7 mM) and total SMPs (82.1 mM) in the hydrogenogenic effluent amended with 200 mg/L MNPs were both the highest. SCFAs and alcohols are easily utilized during AD process because these substrates are preferentially used by electron-donating bacteria as electron donors [11], resulting in enrichment of exoelectrogenic bacteria capable of participating in DIET. Thus, biomethane production was enhanced most significantly by dosing 200 mg/L MNPs. In addition, compared with another work reported by Isfahani et al. to improve the AD performance with metal oxide based NPs [49], the enhancement effect on final methane yield with MNPs in this work was more obvious. This can be mainly ascribed to the fact that the DIET between electroactive bacteria and methanogens was more easily triggered in view of the high SCFAs concentration of the feedstock (hydrogenogenic effluent) and favorable electrochemical property of MNPs used in this study, while the main effect of Fe2O3–TiO2 and NiO–TiO2 NPs used by Isfahani et al. was reported to accelerate the hydrolysis of wheat straw feedstock in the early stage of AD [49]. Therefore, the effects of NPs on AD process can be related to the types and characteristics of feedstock and NPs used."
12,Effects of MNPs on electron transfer capacity and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of methanogenic activated sludge (MAS),"3.6 Effects of MNPs on electron transfer capacity and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of methanogenic activated sludge (MAS) The impacts of MNPs on the capacity of extracellular electron transfer of MAS were assessed by electrochemical methods. As shown in Fig. 6 A and B, CV curves of samples taken from methanogenic reactors added with 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs were obtained. From CV curves of the control group without MNPs addition, two distinct redox peaks with potentials of −0.03 and −0.46 V and currents of 1.40 and −1.58 mA were observed at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. For the group treated with 200 mg/L MNPs, the peak potentials of two redox peaks were −0.05 and −0.48 V, respectively, and the peak currents were 1.904 and −2.27 mA, respectively, at the scan rate of 100 mV/s. Previous studies indicated that the shapes and potentials of redox peaks are associated with the type of electroactive microorganisms and electrochemically active EPS, and the peak currents are probably related to the abundance of them [50,51]. It can be found that the shapes and potentials of redox peaks of the 200 mg/L MNPs treated group were similar with those of the control group, whereas the peak currents were larger. This result suggested that the type of electroactive bacteria and electrochemically active EPS involved in extracellular electron transfer probably did not change dramatically with the addition of MNPs, while the abundance of them significantly increased. Although it was difficult to identify the particular redox reactions from the redox peaks in CV curves due to the complexity of microorganisms and extracellular redox electron shuttles, the CV test could be used for quantificationally determining the extracellular electron transfer capacity between microorganism and electrode [51,52]. As illustrated in Fig. 6A and B, the peak currents and scan rates had linear relationship, which represents typical kinetically-controlled processes. Thus the apparent electron transfer rate constant kapp can be obtained according to the Laviron equation [33]. The kapp value of the control group was 0.0204 ± 0.0012 s−1, which increased to 0.0457 ± 0.0009 s−1 with 200 mg/L MNPs addition, indicating that the extracellular electron transfer capability of the methanogenic system was improved with the addition of MNPs. Fig. 6C presents electrical conductivities of MAS taken from methanogenic reactors treated with 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs. The conductivity of MAS increased from 6.25 ± 1.21 to 13.3 ± 1.34 μs/cm in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs. Furthermore, it has been reported that the abundance of electrochemically active EPS secreted by electroactive bacteria, such as c-Cyts and humic substances, have a significant impact on the electrochemical characteristic of methanogenic aggregates [24,53]. To evaluate the contribution of MNPs and the EPS generated by electroactive bacteria on the electrical conductivity of methanogenic system, the conductivity of MAS without EPS in the presence of 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs were tested. After removing EPS with a modified heat method (see Supplementary material), the conductivity of MAS treated with 200 mg/L MNPs (7.5 ± 0.22 μs/cm) was tremendously higher than that without MNPs addition (1.53 ± 0.334 μs/cm), which can be mostly attributed to the contribution of MNPs. In the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs, the contribution of EPS on the methanogenic system conductivity (5.8 ± 0.9 μs/cm) were comparable to that of the MNPs (5.97 ± 0.21 μs/cm). Furthermore, the electron exchange capacity (EEC), including the EAC and EDC, of EPS in the absence and presence MNPs were tested to evaluate the effect of MNPs on the electrochemical property of EPS (Fig. 6D). With the addition of 200 mg/L MNPs, the EAC and EDC of EPS increased by 30.8% and 35.2%, respectively (P < 0.05). It was reported that the EEC can indicate the total amount of redox active mediators in a sample [24], therefore the increased EEC of EPS with the addition of MNPs implied that MNPs probably promoted the secretion of redox active EPS. As shown in Fig. 7 , 3-DEEM spectra were used to characterize the effect of MNPs on the content of EPS. Five EPS components were recognized from the 3-DEEM spectra, and the percent fluorescence responses of them were calculated. The calculation results showed that the percentages of fluorescence response of Region III and Region V are 10.44% and 9.45% in the control group, 13.42% and 12.51% in the group treated with 200 mg/L MNPs. The organic substances situated in Region III (fulvic acid-like substances) and Region V (humic acid-like substances) belonged to humic substances [54]. Previous researches indicated that EAC and EDC had positive correlation with the content of humic substances due to the presence of redox active groups of quinones in humic substances [24]. Additionally, humic substance analogue such as AQDS and fulvic acid have been demonstrated to be capable of facilitating DIET between two Geobacter species [55]. Therefore, the addition of MNPs promoted the increase in the fraction of electrochemically active EPS, including humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances, which can serve as redox electron shuttles between syntrophic partners. Furthermore, the percent fluorescence response of Region I decreased from 59.11% to 52.38% with the addition of 200 mg/L MNPs. The organic matter located in Region I (tyrosine-like proteins) is usually considered to be biodegradable [31]. This result implied that the biodegradability of methanogenic system probably improved with the addition of MNPs."
13,Effects of MNPs on methanogenic microbial community structure,"3.7 Effects of MNPs on methanogenic microbial community structure As shown in Fig. 8 , microbial community (bacteria and archaea) analysis was performed at the genus level for the seed MAS, as well as the MAS taken from AD reactors without MNPs (control group) and with 200 mg/L of MNPs addition. 3.7.1 Bacterial community analysis The bacteria from the seed MAS were mixed fermentative bacteria that had not been acclimated by hydrogenogenic effluent. The dominant bacterial genera were Hydrogenophaga (15.87%), Saccharofermentans (6.91%) and Alkaliphilus (6.45%). Hydrogenophaga are facultative hydrogenophilic autotrophs that can oxidize glucose using oxygen or nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor [56]. Saccharofermentans are capable of degrading various carbohydrates into organic acids [57]. Alkaliphilus are alkalophilic microorganisms suitable for growth in environments above pH 8.0 [58]. After acclimation in effluents from the hydrogen fermentation stage, the dominant bacterial genera shifted to Alkaliphilus (10.49%), Thiopseudomonas (8.99%) and Saccharofermentans (8.38%). The relative abundance of Hydrogenophaga significantly decreased to 0.98%. This was probably due to the lower hydrogen partial pressure caused by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the AD reactors, which can inhibit the growth of hydrogenophilic bacteria. In contrast, Saccharofermentans were enriched, which can be attributed to the acclimation to residual glucose in the hydrogenogenic effluent. The relative abundance of Thiopseudomonas, which is capable of oxidizing acetate [59], increased from 3.60% to 8.99%; therefore acetate contained in the hydrogenogenic effluent can promote the enrichment of this genus. Additionally, the consumption of VFAs in the fermentation broth, which increased the pH, was favorable for the enrichment of Alkaliphilus, as demonstrated by its higher relative abundance. In the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs, Alkaliphilus (11.29%) and Saccharofermentans (8.64%) remained dominant, with relative abundances slightly higher than those of the control group. The relative abundance of Levilinea, which can also metabolize carbohydrates to generate organic acids [60], increased from 1.36% to 2.85%. Organic acid products are the main substrate used by electron-donating bacteria involved in DIET; thus, the consumption of organic acids likely boosted the proliferation of Levilinea. Syntrophomonas, accounting for 2.53%, were also enriched after dosing with 200 mg/L MNPs. This genus is capable of oxidizing fatty acid to produce H2 and CO2, which can be further used to produce methane through co-culturing with hydrogenotrophic methanogens [61]. Recent studies have reported the enrichment of Syntrophomonas by adding CMs such as biochar [62], carbon cloth [2] and magnetite [63] to AD systems. Furthermore, Zhao et al. proposed that Syntrophomonas enriched with ferroferric oxide can oxidize organic acids to produce H+, e− and CO2 (CH3(CH2)nCOOH + 2H2O → CH3(CH2)n−2COOH + CH3COOH + 4H+ + 4e−), which are subsequently consumed by Methanosaeta to produce methane (8H+ + 8e− + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O) [63]. Therefore, Syntrophomonas may be one of the bacteria involved in DIET triggered by MNPs. The relative abundance of Hydrogenophaga (a hydrogenophilic genus) accounted for only 0.45%, which was a 53.5% decrease when compared with the control group. This result indicates that the hydrogen partial pressure level in the AD reactor treated with 200 mg/L MNPs probably decreased, thereby shifting the mode of interspecies electron transfer between bacteria and archaea from interspecies hydrogen transfer (IHT) to DIET. Jing et al. reported that the Gibbs free energy calculated based on DIET is lower than that calculated based on IHT; therefore, magnetite-triggered DIET is thermodynamically more favorable than IHT [64]. The relative abundance of Sulfurospirillum was 2.04 times higher than that of the control group (0.16%). This genus can use ferrous iron and elemental sulfur as electron acceptors to oxidize butyrate, lactate and acetate [65,66], thus VFAs and MNPs in the fermentation broth promoted the enrichment of Sulfurospirillum. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Desulfobulbus, another electroactive bacteria that can oxidize organic acids [67], increased from 1.20% to 1.26%. 3.7.2 Archaeal community analysis The most dominant archaeal genera of the seed MAS were Methanospirillum (48.91%), Methanoculleus (18.00%) and Methanosaeta (13.44%). Methanospirillum and Methanoculleus are hydrogenotrophic methanogens that can use H2 or formate to reduce CO2 and produce methane [68,69]. Methanosaeta are acetoclastic methanogens that directly metabolize acetate to CH4 and CO2 [70]. After AD, the dominant archaea shifted to Methanoculleus (44.71%), Methanosarcina (15.98%) and Methanomassiliicoccus (13.85%). Methanosarcina can produce methane through both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways [71]. Methanomassiliicoccus can reduce methanol/methylamine to methane using H2 as an electron donor; however, it unable to produce methane with only H2 or methanol as a substrate, and CO2 and nitrate cannot replace methanol as the electron acceptor [72]. The shift in the archaeal community structure indicates that methanogenic pathways become more abundant after the domestication of hydrogenogenic effluent; however, the hydrogenotrophic pathway still remains dominant. After the addition of 200 mg/L MNPs, Methanoculleus remained the dominant (45.81%) archaeal species. It is worth noting that the relative abundance of Methanosarcina substantially increased to 24.61%. Methanosarcina is a common methanogen capable of participating in DIET. Many studies have reported that Methanosarcina are enriched after adding CMs, such as magnetite [22], carbon cloth [2] and biochar [62], in AD system. The co-culture of M. barkeri and G. metallireducens can reduce CO2 to produce methane through DIET, as G. metallireducens transfer electrons to M. barkeri through conductive pili [73] or by artificially adding CMs such as GAC, biochar and carbon cloth. Methanospirillum were enriched from 5.22% to 7.03% in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs. This result is consistent with a previous study that Methanospirillum were enriched when adding magnetite during the methanation of propionate [64]. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Methanobacterium decreased from 7.46% to 5.79%. As typical hydrogen-utilizing methanogen capable of maintaining the balance of hydrogen partial pressure in AD systems, the decreased abundance of Methanobacterium suggests that the electron transfer mode in the AD system possibly shifted from IHT to DIET. This result agrees with Zhao et al., who found that the abundance of Methanobacterium decreased drastically in the AD reactor with the addition of magnetite [63]."
14,Picrust analysis of methane metabolism function,"3.8 Picrust analysis of methane metabolism function The metabolism function of microbial communities based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing results can be predicted using the PICRUSt software. The veracity of metabolism function prediction by PICRUSt is approximately 84% to 95%, which can reasonably reflect the functional genetic makeup of the sample. Fig. 9 A shows the enriched genes encoding metabolic enzymes involved in methanogenic pathways after adding 200 mg/L MNPs. According to the KEGG database, the methanogenic pathways can be divided into three categories: the CO2 reduction pathway, the acetoclastic pathway and the methylotrophic pathway, as shown in Fig. 9B. Genes encoding enzymes involved in the CO2 reduction pathway in the presence of 0 and 200 mg/L MNPs were both dominant compared to the acetoclastic and methylotrophic pathways (Fig. 9A). This is mainly related to the microbial community structure of the two reactors, since the typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus is the most abundant archaea in both reactors. In the CO2 reduction pathway, the relative abundances of genes encoding formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (EC: 1.2.7.12) and coenzyme F420 hydrogenase (EC: 1.12.98.1) are relatively high. Formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase is primarily responsible for catalyzing the first step during the conversion of CO2 to methane, i.e. reducing CO2 to formylmethanofuran using reduced ferredoxin, and the relative abundance of gene encoding which increased from 0.933% to 0.989% after the addition of MNPs. The relative abundance of the coding gene for coenzyme F420 hydrogenase, which converts oxidized coenzyme F420 to reduced coenzyme F420, increased from 0.310% to 0.340% after the addition of MNPs. With respect to the acetoclastic pathway, acetate can be converted to acetyl-CoA through two ways. First, acetate can be converted to acetyl phosphate through the catalysis of acetate kinase (EC: 2.7.2.1), and then the conversion of acetyl phosphate to acetyl-CoA occurs by phosphate acetyltransferase (EC: 2.3.1.8). Alternatively, acetate can be directly catalyzed to acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC: 6.2.1.1). In the acetoclastic pathway, the relative abundance of the coding gene for acetyl-CoA synthetase was the highest (0.273%), and it was not significantly increased with the addition of MNPs. The relative abundances of coding genes for acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase were 0.006% each, and the abundance increased slightly to 0.009% after the addition of MNPs. This result may be related to the enrichment of Methanosarcina, which mainly converts acetate to acetyl-CoA through the mechanism described above [74]. The relative abundance of the coding gene for acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (ACDS) increased from 0.056% to 0.080% after the addition of MNPs. ACDS is a key enzyme involved in the acetoclastic pathway, which catalyzes the splitting of acetyl-CoA into methyltetrahydromethanopterin, CO and coenzyme A. In the methylotrophic pathway, the relative abundances of genes encoding methanol cobalamin methyltransferase (EC: 2.1.1.90) and coenzyme M methyltransferase (EC: 2.1.1.246) slightly increased after the addition of MNPs. Finally, the relative abundances of genes encoding tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase (EC: 2.1.1.86, 0.668%) and coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase (EC: 2.8.4.1, 0.387%), which are involved in the last steps of the three methanogenic pathways, increased to 0.718% and 0.403%, respectively, after the addition of MNPs. In addition, the relative abundances of CoB-CoM heterodisulfide reductase (EC: 1.8.98.1, 0.019%) and CoB-CoM heterodisulfide (EC: 1.8.98.6, 0.467%) were slightly increased to 0.027% and 0.474%, respectively."
15,Proposed mechanisms for enhanced hydrogen and methane co-generation with MNPs and the significance of this study,"3.9 Proposed mechanisms for enhanced hydrogen and methane co-generation with MNPs and the significance of this study The mechanisms for fermentative hydrogen and methane production enhanced by MNPs were proposed (Fig. 10 ). During the dark hydrogen fermentation stage, glucose was first degraded to pyruvate by E. aerogenes ZJU1, which was accompanied with NADH production that can be oxidized by NFOR [38], subsequently the generated electrons were transported to hydrogenase to produce hydrogen by reducing protons. Pyruvate is then further converted to formate or acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can be degraded via three pathways resulting in acetate, butyrate or ethanol as the final product [38]. Analysis of SMPs showed the shift of the fermentation metabolic pathway of E. aerogenes ZJU1 from the butyrate to the acetate pathway, which was beneficial in providing more NADH to produce hydrogen through the NADH-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the addition of MNPs increased the activity of hydrogenase and ETS, which are likely attributed to the enhanced biosynthesis of hydrogenase and intracellular electron transfer between NFOR and hydrogenase. These favorable effects result in a significant improvement of hydrogen production for E. aerogenes ZJU1. After completing dark fermentation, the effluent containing SMPs, residual glucose and additive MNPs were inoculated with mixed methanogens. According to the analysis of microbial community, residual glucose was degraded into fatty acids and CO2 by glycolytic bacteria, such as Saccharofermentans and Levilinea. The fatty acids and hydrogenogenic effluent SMPs were further decomposed by acetogens or electroactive bacteria, such as Syntrophomonas, Sulfurospirillum or Desulfobulbus, to produce acetate, CO2 and electrons. Finally, acetate and CO2 could be converted into CH4 through the acetoclastic and CO2 reduction pathways by archaea, respectively. CO2 reduction pathway was significantly enhanced in the presence of MNPs due to the improved extracellular electron transfer capacity, which resulted from MNPs serving as electron transfer conduit and redox active EPS, including humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances, functioning as electron transfer mediators. Furthermore, analysis of methane metabolism functions revealed that MNPs facilitate the enrichment of genes encoding enzymes involved in CO2 reduction to methane. Therefore, it is thought that MNPs can stimulate DIET between bacteria and methanogens, which were represented by Syntrophomonas and Methanosarcina, respectively. In brief, this study provided a feasible strategy to enhance two-stage hydrogen and methane production by regulating microbial electron transfer and syntrophism with the addition of MNPs. The findings of this study clarified the responses of the hydrogen production pathways, NADH level, activities of hydrogenase and electron transport system (ETS) to the addition of MNPs during the first-stage fermentation as well as the enhancement mechanism of DIET between syntrophic microorganisms with the recycled MNPs during the second-stage AD. Moreover, this study demonstrated the chain effect of MNPs on the two-stage process, for instance, the effect of MNPs on SMPs in the hydrogen production stage can potentially affect the enrichment of specific syntrophic bacteria in the AD stage, thus having a cascading effect on the methanogenesis process. Future work is required to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of such two-stage system with magnetic CMs added using complex organics as feedstock. Moreover, this system needs further optimization to promote the full-scale application and expand its beneficial environmental impact."
16,Energy conversion efficiency of two-stage AD,"3.10 Energy conversion efficiency of two-stage AD The heat values for hydrogen, methane and glucose are 242, 801 and 2888 kJ/mol, respectively [75]. The ECE values for fermentative hydrogen and methane cogeneration from glucose are shown in Table 1 . The total ECE reached the maximum (83.8%) in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs, which is 22.7% higher than that of the control group. Additionally, the ECE of the hydrogen production stage increased from 14.5% to 17.6% and the ECE of methane production increased from 53.8% to 66.2%. This result indicates that the ECE of fermentative hydrogen and methane cogeneration from glucose can be improved with the addition of MNPs; in particular, 200 mg/L MNPs can simultaneously and effectively increase the ECE in both the hydrogen and methane fermentation stages."
17,Conclusions,"This study demonstrates that the appropriate dose of MNPs can effectively promote fermentative hydrogen and methane cogeneration from glucose. During the hydrogen-producing stage, the hydrogen production pathway shift from butyrate pathway to acetate pathway in the presence of 200 mg/L MNPs, leading to the high NADH/NAD+ ratio. Additionally, the activities of hydrogenase and ETS of E. aerogenes ZJU1 were increased. These favorable conditions were beneficial for hydrogen production via the NADH-dependent pathway. During the AD stage, MNPs can not only work as electron transfer conduit between syntrophic partners, but also stimulate the production of electrochemically active EPS serving as redox mediators. Microbial community indicated that Syntrophomonas/Sulfurospirillum/Desulfobulbus and Methanosarcina, which were enriched in the presence of MNPs, were probably involved in methanogenesis through DIET."
