0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline provide most of the energy needs of the world today, however, due to their diminishing reserves, high prices and most importantly, their detrimental effect on the environment, alternative sources of energy and environmentally friendly fuels are now being developed. Today, molecular hydrogen is currently regarded as the most promising future energy source as it shows clean combustion and can easily be converted into electricity via fuel cells. In order to consolidate the benefits of using hydrogen as a fuel or energy carrier, alternative but cleaner processes that rely on renewable feedstock must be developed [1]. In the past, biological hydrogen production has been reported from numerous waste and wastewater sources such as municipal solid waste [2], food waste [3,4], rice winery wastewater [5], molasses and sugary wastewater [6,7], starch wastewater [8,9], domestic wastewater [10], lignocellulose materials such as rice straw, coir and sugar bagasse [11], paper sludge [12], palm oil mill effluents [13] and corn syrup water [14]. These studies have shown that biohydrogen production can rely on carbohydrate rich wastewater and waste as feedstock thereby providing a twin solution to bioremediation and energy generation. However, the sustainability of such a process largely depends not only on the availability of locally abundant renewable feedstock but also on the development of a microorganism that can maximise substrate conversion and energy yields from the process. Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after the milk has been curdled and strained. It is a by product of the manufacture of cheese. Whey contains about 5% (w/v) lactose [15], which is sufficient substrate to be used for fermentation purposes. Proper management of cheese whey is important due to strict legislative regulations governing effluent, as well as economic reasons that force its valorisation [16] Even though there are a number of technological developments in the utilisation of whey to other useful products, disposal of whey still remains a significant problem in the dairy industry [17]. These characteristics make this by product a suitable substrate for biohydrogen production. Dark fermentation employs both obligate anaerobes such as clostridia species as well as facultative anaerobes such as Eschericia and Enterobacter species. Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 has been previously well characterized and found suitable for hydrogen production studies as it has a high growth rate 0.57 h−1 and can utilize a wide range of carbon sources [18]. However, the yield reported from the wild type strain is 2.2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose whereas the theoretical maximum is 4 mol H2 mol−1 glucose [19]. Thus, the currently reported yield is too low to be an economically attractive and viable alternative to the existing chemical or electrochemical approaches. This bottleneck may be overcome by improvisation of process parameters, metabolic engineering or by genetic engineering approaches. Various earlier studies on this organism have focused on improvement of process parameter designs [19,20] and redirection of metabolic pathways [21]. However, till date, there has been no report on substantial improvement of the strain’s hydrogen production ability by genetic approaches. Morimoto et al. [22] showed that intracellular hydrogenase levels may be an indicator of the metabolic bottleneck for Clostridial H2 production. In the past, several investigators have reported heterologous overexpression of hydrogenase [23,24] and a few have reported homologous overexpression of hydrogenase gene [25,26] to enhance H2 production. Hypothesising that intracellular concentration of [FeFe] hydrogenase may be a rate limiting step in H2 production in Enterobacteriacae, in this study, we attempt to develop a genetically modified organism by homologous overexpression of FeFe hydrogenase in E. cloacae IIT-BT 08. Overexpression of [FeFe] hydrogenase in E. cloacae may play an important role in improving biohydrogen evolution by transferring reduced equivalents from electron donors to protons. Further, based on this work it may be possible, in future, to synthesize large amounts of [FeFe] hydrogenases for detailed biophysical analyses of this potent enzyme family leading to an improved description and explanation of their structure and function. Besides, the study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using whey as substrate for hydrogen production from the recombinant strain thus developed. In addition, the effect of supplementation of yeast extract on maximization of hydrogen production from whey was studied. Finally, the recombinant strain was compared with the wild strain E. cloacae IIT-BT-08 with respect to various hydrogen production parameters using whey as substrate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Bacterial strains, plasmids and media","2.1 Bacterial strains, plasmids and media Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Bacterial strain, E. cloacae IIT-BT 08, isolated and characterized previously by Kumar and Das [18] was used in the present study. The strain was routinely maintained aerobically on nutrient agar medium at 37 °C by monthly transfer. For recombinant E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 hydA+ strains, 25 μg mL−1 kanamycin was added liquid culture and grown over night. E. cloacae strains were stored at −20 °C as glycerol stocks."
3,Cloning of E. cloacae hydA gene,"2.2 Cloning of E. cloacae hydA gene Genomic DNA was isolated from mid-log phase cells by Marmur’s method as described previously [27]. A 444 bp DNA region containing the hydA ORF was amplified using Pfu polymerases (Fermentas) and subcloned into the pBSK cloning vector, to construct the recombinant plasmid pBSK-hydA. For expression cloning, the primers HYD-F and HYD-R used for the amplification of hydA were designed to incorporate suitable restriction sites BamHI and XhoI in the forward and reverse primers respectively."
4,Construction of recombinant plasmid and strains,"2.3 Construction of recombinant plasmid and strains E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 encoded ampicillin resistance; therefore, the expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia, USA) was reconstructed by disrupting its ampicillin antibiotic resistance gene at a unique Pst1 site (at position 1922) by a kanamycin cassette, having its own promoter, digested from pUC-4K (GE Healthcare, USA). The Escherichia coli–E. cloacae shuttle vector pGEX-Kan was thus developed. The hydA gene PCR amplicon was double-digested with BamHI and XhoI, gel-purified and subcloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of BamHI and XhoI digested pGEX-Kan vector, downstream of the tac promoter, to develop the pGEX-Kan-hydA recombinant vector (Fig. 1 ). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL-21 and the transformants were scored on Luria-Bertani agar containing Kanamycin (25 μg mL−1) and IPTG (20 μg mL−1). Inframe ligation of hydA with the promoter of the selected positive clones was confirmed by sequencing. Thereafter, the recombinant vector was chemically transformed into the competent E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 cells."
5,Hydrogen assay,"2.4 Hydrogen assay For hydrogen production, 10% (v/v) over night grown seed culture was inoculated into 300 mL MYG (1% (w/v) malt extract, 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract and 1% (w/v) glucose) or whey and grown aerobically till the O.D reached 0.4. Thereafter, the recombinant E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 hydA+ was induced with 500 μM IPTG (isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoiside) and adapted for 3 h under anaerobic conditions. Further, hydrogen production was carried out in 500 mL capacity shake flasks as described previously by Kumar and Das [18]. pH was adjusted to 6.5 by adding 5.0 N NaOH. For all the experiments E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 (wild type) was used as a control."
6,Hydrogenase assay,"2.5 Hydrogenase assay 2.5.1 Preparation of crude extracts exhibiting H2ase activity Cells from 300 mL cultures of both E. cloacae wild and recombinant strains were anaerobically harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 6000 g) at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with basal buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH-8.0, 20 mM sodium dithionite, Na-dithionite) and anaerobically harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 6000 g) at 4 °C followed by resuspension in the basal buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH-8.0, 20 mM Na-dithionite) containing 2 mM dithiothretol (DTT), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. The cells were stirred slowly for 30 min and lysed by ultrasonication (Misonix, USA) (40 s on 30 s off per cycle) at 4 °C. The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (Sorvall, USA) at 1,50,000 g for 120 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the crude cell lysate. 2.5.2 Assay The assay was performed as described previously by Dutta et al. [28]. Briefly, the H2ase activity was quantified by the amount of H2 evolved from Na-dithionite reduced methyl viologen (MV). The assay was performed in a gas-tight screw cap vials containing 2 mL of 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH-8.0, 5 mM MV, 10 mM Na-dithionite. The reaction was initiated after addition of the crude cell lysate. The assay mixtures were bubbled with argon to remove traces of dissolved oxygen before addition of the enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated in a shaker at 25 °C for 10 min. One unit of the enzyme is defined as the amount of H2ase evolving 1 ìmol of H2/min. The gas generated was analysed by gas chromatography (Perkin–Elmer, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector using 80/100 Porapak-Q (3.2 mm × 2 m) column."
7,SDS – PAGE analysis,"2.6 SDS – PAGE analysis Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) was performed with samples diluted in 4 × SDS–PAGE loading buffer (Novagen). The samples were boiled for 10 min, cooled on ice, and then loaded onto a 12% (w/v) resolving gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 80 V for 4 h."
8,Whey collection and characterization,"2.7 Whey collection and characterization Fresh crude (unskimmed) cheese whey was obtained from a sweet factory located in Kharagpur, West Bengal, India. Standard methods of APHA - AWWA were used for determination physico-chemical and biochemical characteristics of whey (Table 2 ) [29]. Whey was kept at 4 °C until used."
9,"Experimental procedure, set-up and hydrogen quantification","2.8 Experimental procedure, set-up and hydrogen quantification Fermentation was carried in Erlenmeyer’s flasks having a working volume of 500 mL at 37 °C and agitated at 150 rpm. Whey was diluted to 90.0% (v/v) with deionised water and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. When needed, whey was supplemented with 0.1–0.4% (w/v) yeast extract. For each experiment, the media was seeded with a 10% (v/v) inoculum and sparged with argon gas (99.9%) as described previously by Kumar and Das [18]. The culture pH was not controlled during fermentation. All experiments were conducted in triplicates."
10,Analytical methods,"2.9 Analytical methods Hydrogen content in the gas was determined in a gas chromatograph (GC; PerkinElmer LLC, MA, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless-steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh) as described previously by Kumar and Das [18]. Total sugar estimation was done using anthrone reagent as described by Loewus [30]. The COD was measured according to APHA standard methods (APHA, 1998) [29] using a COD measurement instrument set (DRB200 & DR2800 Portable Spectrophotometer, HACH®, USA). The pH values were monitored using a desktop pH metre (pH510, Cyberscan, Singapore). Biomass was measured turbidometrically at 600 nm using UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, PerkinElmer LLC, MA, USA)."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Improvement of hydrogen production rate by development of a homologous recombinant strain,"3.1 Improvement of hydrogen production rate by development of a homologous recombinant strain Recombinant strains can be developed through genetic and metabolic engineering which may lead to higher levels of hydrogen production. One strategy may be to enhance the specific hydrogenase activity by genetic modification. The [FeFe] hydrogenase from E. cloacae is transcribed from a 444 bp hydA gene investigated in detail in the past by Mishra et al. [27]. Though, it is the smallest hydrogenase known to date, the gene sequence coding for this enzyme is found to be similar to those of several known [FeFe] hydrogenases, mainly in the C-terminal region which includes the enzyme active site [27,31,32]. For expression of hydrogenase, the hydA gene was initially amplified under the control of the T7 lac promoter in the pGEX-Kan E. coli–E. cloacae shuttle vector. E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 was used as the host strain to over express the recombinant hydA for investigation of improved hydrogen production. Finally, a recombinant E. cloacae strain carrying multiple copies of the hydA gene was developed. The cloned hydA gene was confirmed by sequencing the recombinant vector and comparing it with the reported sequence in the NCBI database (GenBank accession number: AY676139). In vivo hydrogenase activity was determined by the hydrogenase assay. Induction parameters including the inducer concentration, period of induction and the cell concentration were optimised in order to increase the yield and rate of hydrogen production from the recombinant strain. Since the hydA gene was under the regulation of the tac promoter, different inducer (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase) concentrations were optimised. Maximum specific hydrogenase activity, 2.143 ± 0.32 μmol H2 (mg protein)−1min−1, was obtained when induced at 0.4 O.D for 3 h with 0.5 mM IPTG. The maximum specific activity for the recombinant was found to be 1.3-fold higher than that of the wild type as shown in Fig. 2 . Thus overexpression of [FeFe] hydrogenae in E. cloacae successfully enhanced hydrogen production. The results suggested that enforced hydrogenase activity accelerated oxidation of ferredoxin to release hydrogen gas [22]. Further, protein expression in the recombinant strain was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis and was compared with that of the wild type strain. The SDS-PAGE gel clearly showed that a protein with a molecular weight of ca. 42.1 kDa [fusion protein of GST (26 kDa) and hydA (16.1 kDa)] was highly expressed in the recombinant strain (Fig. 3 ). In vitro hydrogen production studies established that the recombinant cells actively produced 1.5 times more cumulative hydrogen production as compared to the wild type in glucose media under anaerobic conditions using 1% (w/v) glucose as substrate. Further, as shown in Table 3 , it was found that the glucose consumption increased to 74% for the recombinant as compared to 67% for the wild type. However, the biomass of the recombinant was found to be less than the wild type which may be due to the additional plasmid (pGEX-Kan-hydA) load on the organism. This is however, in contrast to the findings of Morimoto et al. [22] where growth rate of the clone was found to be identical to that of the host. Further, the composition of the end metabolites (butyric acid, acetic acid and ethanol) produced by the wild type and recombinant strain were determined and compared (Fig. 4 ). Acetate and butyrate fermentation on glucose by typical acidogenic Enterobacter species ideally proceeds according to the following Eq. (1) (1) Glucose → 0.8 butyrate + 0.4 acetate + 2 CO 2 + 2.4 H 2 It was found that in the recombinant strain, the acetic acid concentration increased in parallel with an increase in hydrogen gas evolution. Besides, at pH 6.5 the acetate to butyrate ratio (A/B ratio) was higher in the recombinant as compared to the wild type (Table 3). This was consistent with higher yields and rate of H2 production at this pH indicating that a higher A/B ratio could result in higher hydrogen productivity. This is in close agreement to the reports by White [33], Kim et al. [34] and Annous et al. [35] who reported that the higher A/B ratio facilitates hydrogen production. Further, the results are consistent with that of Morimoto et al. [22] who showed that overexpression of hydrogenase induced acetic acid production while drastically decreased lactic acid. It was also noted that ethanol was produced in significant concentrations both in the wild type and the recombinant. This is contrast with the result of Klein et al. [25] who showed that solvent production was below detection limits. Thus, the results clearly demonstrated that hydrogen evolution by E. cloacae was limited by the availability of active hydA which is in contrast to the findings of Klein et al. [25] for hydrogen production in Clostridium acetobutylicum. Recently, Zhao et al. [32] developed a recombinant by over expressing the synthetic hydA gene from E. cloacae into hydrogen producing strain of Enterobacter aerogenes (ATCC13408) and reported a 1.95 times increase in hydrogen production in comparison to the wild type, using 1% (w/v) glucose as substrate. Previous studies by Kumar et al. [21] have shown that hydrogen yields can be greatly enhanced by blocking solvent and lactic acid production. High ethanol production may still be a bottleneck to further enhanced hydrogen yields. Thus, in future, further improvements in the hydrogen yield may be achieved by overexpression of hydA coupled with genetic knockouts of alcohol and lactic acid pathways."
13,Fermentative performance using cheese whey as substrate,"3.2 Fermentative performance using cheese whey as substrate The study comparatively evaluated the feasibility of biohydrogen production from the wild and recombinant strains of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 using whey as substrate. The fermentation of raw whey, without supplements, resulted in low hydrogen production. The maximum hydrogen yield observed was 3.39 mmol gCOD−1 fed and 2.97 mmol gCOD−1 fed in the recombinant and wild type respectively. Previous researchers, Gaweland Kosikowski [15] Glass and Hedrick [36] and Zertuche and Zell [37] have reported that the lactose concentration of whey is around 5% and protein around 0.9%. Further, it has been reported that the limiting factor for whey fermentation by E. coli is essentially nitrogen, because protein is not an available nitrogen source for this organism, thus supplementation of whey with nitrogenous sources has been recommended to improve fermentation. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of yeast extract 0.1–0.4% (w/v) as nitrogen source for whey was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 , it was found that on supplementation of whey with 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract the maximum hydrogen yield from both the wild and recombinant type increased to 5.54 and 7.96 mmol gCOD−1 fed, respectively, indicating that nitrogenous sources were limiting to the growth and hydrogen production from this bacteria using whey as substrate. This is in concurrence with Yang et al. [38] who reported 10 mmol gCOD−1 fed with mesophilic mixed consortia. The maximum rate of hydrogen production obtained with 0.3% (w/v) yeast supplementation for the recombinant and wild type strains obtained were 6.31 mmol L−1 h−1 and 2.87 mmol L−1 h−1 respectively. Further, it was observed that any further increase in yeast supplementation had no significant effect on either yield or rate of hydrogen production (Fig. 5). This is in close agreement to the rate of hydrogen production obtained by various researchers as shown in Table 4 [1,38–46]. However, the rate of hydrogen production obtained in the current study is significantly less as compared to Vazquez et al. [42], who reported 46.61 mmol L−1 h−1 using cheese whey powder and sludge as seed. The final pH of the spent media was always in the range of 5.5–5.8 (data not shown) which is unlike the drastic drop in pH levels which occur in the dark fermentation using glucose as substrate. This was due to the significantly lower concentrations of VFA produced during fermentation using cheese whey as substrate. The volatile fatty acid analysis showed butyrate type fermentation having ethanol, butyrate and acetic acid as the major components (Fig. 6 a, Fig. 6b and Fig. 6c). In the past, several investigators [34,47–49] have reported higher butyrate to acetate ratio. However, this was found to be in contrast to the acetate type fermentation which was dominant when glucose was used as substrate. Thus, the study showed the feasibility of whey as sole carbon source for biohydrogen production. Further, the study showed the recombinant as more promising with 2.2-fold enhanced rate of hydrogen production compared to the wild type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing whey as a promising substrate for biohydrogen production from Enterobacter."
14,Conclusion,"E. cloacae is a promising target for metabolic engineering strategies to improve biological hydrogen production. In the present work, effects of hydrogenase overexpression on hydrogen evolution of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 in batch fermentations with both pure glucose and whey were investigated. The overexpression of [FeFe] hydrogenase in E. cloacae played an important role in improving biohydrogen evolution both in vitro and in vivo, by transferring electrons from electron donors to protons. The hydrogenase activity and hydrogen yield in recombinant strain were 1.3-fold and 1.2-fold higher than those of the wild type strain. The enhancement of hydrogen production was related to the changes in concentrations of main metabolites formed. Further, the recombinant showed a promising potential for bioremediation of whey when supplemented with 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract. However, it was seen that yield and rate of hydrogen production was comparatively low with whey as compared with glucose as substrate. Therefore, in future, further maximization of hydrogen yield may be obtained by supplementation of whey with Fe2+ and Mg2+ ions which act as cofactors of various enzymes involved in the fermentation pathway. It may be concluded that the elimination of lactose by fermentation using recombinant E. cloacae for acetate and butyrate production generates biohydrogen as by product. This opens new perspectives for the valorisation of the huge amounts of milk permeate, formed by the cheese industry. This waste could thus be used for production of low cost biohydrogen. Further, based on this work it may be possible to synthesize large amounts of high quality [FeFe] hydrogenases for detailed biophysical analyses and possible crystallization of this potent enzyme for a detailed insight into its structure and function."
