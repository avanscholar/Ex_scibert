0,Introduction,"The rapid consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels has resulted in environmental pollution and severe energy crisis, which emphasize the importance of renewable biofuel production. Biological hydrogen is a carbon-free renewable energy carrier, with the high energy density (Turner, 2004). Biological hydrogen production via anaerobic digestion is a less energy-intensive, environmental-friendly and sustainable method compared to the current energy production methods (Gomez-Flores et al., 2015). Several types of substrate have been utilized for biological hydrogen production through anaerobic digestion such as food waste (Nguyen et al., 2017), sugarcane straw (Janke et al., 2017), kitchen waste (Gao et al., 2015), fruits and vegetables waste (Scano et al., 2014), brown algae (Fasahati et al., 2017), organic waste (Lastella et al., 2002) and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (Barati et al. 2017). Anaerobic digestion for hydrogen production offers numerous significant advantages such as low sludge production and low energy requirement (Chen et al., 2008). Currently, organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) has been given attention to be utilized for hydrogen production (Rao et al., 2000). The generation of MSW amounts to 0.11 kg/capita/day according to central pollution control board (GIZ, 2015). Approx, 60% of municipal solid waste is organic fraction such as waste paper, urban greening waste and kitchen waste (Dong et al., 2009). Utilization of OFMSW for hydrogen production alleviates conflict between demand and energy supply as well as improves economic feasibility for treatment of municipal solid waste (Ionescu et al., 2013). In the dark fermentation process, the theoretical hydrogen yield depends on the type of microorganisms used. Based on the results of our previous investigations, in the present study, co-culture of E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes was used (Sharma and Melkania, 2017). Both the bacteria are facultative anaerobic and have the capability to grow under strict anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli have been isolated from sewage sludge and applied for production of hydrogen in the previous studies (Rachman et al., 1997; Jame et al., 2011; Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Both the bacterial species can utilize a wide range of substrate with fast growth rate and high tolerance to hydrogen partial pressure and dissolved oxygen (Zhang et al., 2011). Both the bacteria produce hydrogen via formate and NADH metabolic pathway (Rosales-Colunga and Rodriguez, 2015). Under formate pathway, formate hydrogen lyase complex is involved, which transforms formate generated from glucose into hydrogen while in NADH pathway, the NADH is the precursor for hydrogen production (Morimoto et al., 2005). E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes have been applied in mono-culture and co-culture systems in the previous studies (Maru et al., 2016). Sivagurunathan et al. (2014) applied E. coli for hydrogen production from fructose and achieved 1.17 mol-hydrogen/mol-fructose of hydrogen yield. Kumar et al. (2015) applied co-culture of E coli XL1-Blue and Enterobacter cloacae for hydrogen production from industrial wastewater and achieved a significant increase in the hydrogen yield. Co-culture of E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes was applied by Maru et al. (2016) for hydrogen production from glycerol who reported a 3.1 fold higher hydrogen productivity by using co-culture as compared to control. Application of co-culture system offers the advantage of improved hydrogen production and yield as compared to mono-culture systems (Pachapur et al., 2015). In co-culture system, different microbial strains are mixed which improves the individual characteristic that other strain lacks. Thus, the co-culture system eliminates the need for pretreatment steps and use of expensive reducing agents (Pachapur et al., 2015). Therefore, the co-culture system is cost-effective as compared to mono-cultures. It offers various advantageous such as resistance to environmental fluctuation, reduction in lag phase and provides eight times more stability in hydrogen production rate as compared to mono-culture systems (Pachapur et al., 2015). Anaerobic digestion has the main drawback that it is highly sensitive to toxicants (Chen et al., 2014). Phenolic compounds are environmental pollutants that are widely distributed due to their resistance to biotic and abiotic degradation (Yaoyu et al., 2014). Phenolic compounds are present in a significant amount of the household waste (Veeresh et al., 2005; Kougias et al., 2014) which is an important fraction of OFMSW. They are derived mostly from industrial and agricultural activities including waste discharge from coking, textiles, preservatives, dyes, herbicides, plastics and paper industries (Yaoyu et al., 2014). Presence of phenolic compounds indicates the co-disposal of hazardous waste in municipal solid waste (Kjeldsen et al., 1998; Slack et al., 2005). Apart from the aforementioned sources, the lignocellulosic material is present in the municipal solid waste, which consists of polymerized sugars such as celluloses and hemicelluloses which generates phenolic compounds as by-products of lignocellulosic hydrolysis (Gupta et al., 2014, Kongjan et al., 2010). Kurata et al. (2008) carried out an extensive study to find out the occurrence of phenols in municipal solid waste landfill leachates and reported that the phenols present there were- cresols, butylphenol, bisphenol A, and some chlorophenols. Tang et al. (2008) evaluated the concentration of catechol in municipal solid waste using artificial neural networks and laccase sensor and reported that catechol was present in the concentration range of 7.5 × 10–7 M to 4.4 × 10–4 M. Phenolic compounds are toxic in nature and difficult to degrade biologically (Kumar et al., 2011). These phenolic compounds have been found to be inhibitory for anaerobic digestion (Mussatto and Roberto, 2004). Kayembe et al. (2013) investigated the effect of phenol on biogas production by anaerobic digestion and found a 50% inhibition at phenol concentration of 1249 mg/L. The inhibition was caused due to integrity loss of biological membrane by phenol which resulted in reduced cell growth and assimilation of sugars (Mussatto and Roberto, 2004). Similarly, Hernandez and Edyvean (2008) evaluated the effect of seven phenolic compounds on anaerobic digestion and reported that 50% inhibition was caused by the addition of 328 mg catechol, 120 mg phenol or 271 mg 4hydroxybenzoic acid per gram-VSS biomass. Cao et al. (2010) has demonstrated the inhibitory effect of phenolic compounds using acid-pretreated corn stalk applying Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16. At higher concentrations, these inhibitors have a negative influence on lag phase and hydrogen yield (Kongjan et al., 2010). The phenolic compounds toxicity is very high even at smaller concentrations (Parajo et al., 1998). However, microbes can convert phenolic compounds to less inhibitory compounds to minimize their inhibitory effects if the concentration of the phenolic compound is within the limit of microbial tolerance (Liu et al., 2005). These investigations show that the presence of phenolic compounds inhibits anaerobic digestion severely. Therefore, it is essential to understand the impact of these inhibitors on anaerobic fermentation so that loss of hydrogen yield due to the presence of these inhibitors can be prevented. In the present study, the impact of phenolic compounds (viz. m-cresol, pentachlorophenol, bisphenol-A, and catechol) was evaluated on hydrogen production from anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste using co-culture of Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and media,"2.1 Microorganisms and media In the present study, the facultative anaerobes E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes were used. The bacteria were isolated from sewage sludge using EMB (Eosin Methylene Blue) agar. EMB agar is a differential and selective media for these bacteria. Luria Bertani medium (5 g yeast extract, 10 g peptone and 10 g NaCl per liter) was used for further growth of the isolated strains. The isolated bacteria were incubated at 37 °C. The isolated bacteria grown for five generations were used in the experiments."
3,Feedstock preparation,"2.2 Feedstock preparation The OFMSW was collected from a locally situated municipal waste landfill site in Uttarakhand, India. The OFMSW comprised of mainly household wastes such as bread, beans, rice, fruits, vegetables, paper, and meat. An electrical grinder was used to grind the OFMSW resulting in the particle size of less than 2 mm. The feedstock (OFMSW) was stored at low temperature (4 °C) to avoid its degradation. The characteristics of the feedstock are given in Table 1 . Density = (kg/m3); volatile solids = % (w/w); Total solids = % (w/w); sCOD(soluble chemical oxygen demand) = (g/L) ; pCOD(particulate chemical oxygen demand) = (g/L); tCOD (total chemical oxygen demand) = (g/L); ammonia = (g/L); total Kjeldahl nitrogen = (g/L); proteins = (g/L); lipids = (g/L); C/N ratio=; butyrate = (g/L); acetate = (g/L); lactate = (g/L); propionate = (g/L); Total volatile fatty acids = (g/L)."
4,Inhibitors,"2.3 Inhibitors Phenolic compounds viz. m-cresol, pentachlorophenol (PCP), bisphenol-A (BPA) and catechol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Their characteristics are given in Table 2 ."
5,Experimental set-up,"2.4 Experimental set-up Glass reactors were used to conduct the experiments. The volume of the glass reactors was 500 mL and contained screw caps filled with butyl rubber in order to extract gas samples. Sterilization of the media was done using an autoclave for 30 min at a pressure of 15 psi and 120 °C temperature. Each glass reactor was filled with 300 mL of OFMSW (with OFMSW concentration of 20 g/L). Then each bottle was inoculated with 25 mL of E. coli cell suspension and 25 mL of Enterobacter aerogenes cell suspension using a sterile syringe. Thus, a working volume of 350 mL was applied in the experiments. The pH of the medium was controlled at 5.5 applying 2 N HCl and 2 N NaOH. Medium sparging was done for 5 min with the pure nitrogen gas. Bottles were capped tightly and sealed with aluminium caps. Each treatment was analysed in triplicate. The phenolic inhibitors were applied in concentration ranges of 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 25.0 mg/L each, using a sterile syringe. The glass reactors were placed in an incubator shaker at 37 °C. The analysis of the composition and amount of the gas samples was done periodically every 12 h."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Total chemical oxygen demand, soluble chemical oxygen demand, particulate chemical oxygen demand, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, lipids, volatile solids, and total solids were estimated by standard methods (APHA, 2005). Proteins and carbohydrates estimation was done by the colorimetric method and phenol-sulfuric acid method (Reddy et al, 2011; Han et al., 2012) respectively. The phenols were estimated by HPLC (HPLC-Agilent 1200, USA) having an equipped UV detector and Aminex HPX-87H column. Sulphuric acid (5 mM H2SO4) was used as mobile phase at 65 °C temperature and 0.5 mL/min flow rate."
7,Gas analysis,"2.6 Gas analysis Analysis of hydrogen and CO2 was done using GC-2014 (Shimadzu), having porapak Q column (0.2 m × 3 mm diameter) fitted with the TCD-thermal conductivity detector. The operational temperature of column, injection port and detector were kept at 100 °C, 120 °C, and 150 °C respectively. Helium (He) was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 35 mL/min. Methane and VFA-volatile fatty acids were too analyzed by the gas chromatography at the same operational conditions using FID (flame ionization detector) instead of TCD. The modified Gompertz equation as shown in Eq. (1) was applied to estimate hydrogen production potential. (1) H = P exp - exp R m a x P ( λ - t ) + 1 where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); P(mL) is the hydrogen potential; Rmax is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); λ is the lag time (h) and t is the incubation time (h). Inhibition coefficient of each phenolic compound was estimated by equation (2). (2) Inhibition coefficient = 100 - hydrogen yield from the substrate with inhibitor hydrogen yield in control × 100"
8,Result and discussion,"As can be seen from Table 3 , the phenol compounds have a significant effect on hydrogen production. The Cumulative hydrogen production data was correlated with the modified Gompertz equation and regression analysis was done to determine the kinetic parameters."
9,Effect of phenol inhibitors on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of phenol inhibitors on hydrogen production Results show that phenolic inhibitors supplementation adversely affected hydrogen production and yield. The cumulative and specific hydrogen production in control was 227.9 ± 10.5 mL and 0.65 LH2/Lsubstrate respectively (Table 3). Fig. 1 shows the effect of phenol inhibitors on hydrogen yield (Fig. 1a) and hydrogen production rate (Fig. 1b). In control, the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production peak rate were 24.2 mLH2/gCarbo and 18.9 mL/h respectively. The supplementation of m-cresol resulted in the decline of cumulative and specific hydrogen production from 227.9 ± 10.5 mL and 0.65 LH2/Lsubstrate respectively in control to 93.4 ± 10.1 mL and 0.26 LH2/Lsubstrate at a concentration of 25 mg/L (Table 3). The hydrogen yield and hydrogen production peak rate declined to 17.4 mLH2/gCarbo and 13.6 mL/h respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, 28.0% decrease in the hydrogen yield was recorded. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) addition resulted in the maximum inhibition of hydrogen production with the minimum cumulative and specific hydrogen production of 36.4 ± 10.1 mL and 0.10 LH2/Lsubstrate respectively at 25 mg/L concentration of PCP (Table 3). Similarly, the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production peak rate declined to 13.6 mLH2/gCarbo and 9.6 mL/h respectively for PCP supplemented experimental batches (Fig. 1a and b) causing a 43.8% decrease in the hydrogen yield. Summarized ANOVA results of the fitting model for different inhibitors were estimated and are shown in Table 3. The model shows a p-value of 0.0061, 0.0145, 0.0092 and 0.0146 respectively for m-cresol, PCP, BPA, and catechol. The p-value for all the inhibitors is less than 0.05 which indicates a statistically significant model. Chlorophenols decrease the physiological activity of the anaerobic bacteria and exert an inhibitory effect on them (Puyol et al., 2011). For bisphenol-A (BPA) added experimental batches, the cumulative and specific hydrogen production declined to a minimum of 58.9 ± 10.4 mL and 0.16 LH2/Lsubstrate respectively at BPA concentration of 25 mg/L (Table 3). Similarly, hydrogen yield and hydrogen production peak rate declined from 24.2 mLH2/gCarbo and 18.9 mL/h in control to 15.2 mLH2/gCarbo and 11.9 mL/hr respectively for BPA treated batches (Fig. 1a and b). This indicates a 37.1% decrease in the hydrogen yield. Catechol addition resulted in the decline of hydrogen production with the minimum cumulative and specific hydrogen production of 85.8 ± 10.3 mL and 0.24 LH2/Lsubstrate respectively at catechol concentration of 25 mg/L (Table 3). For catechol treated experimental batches, the hydrogen yield, and hydrogen production peak rate were 16.5 mLH2/gCarbo and 12.9 mL/h respectively (Fig. 1a and b). Thus, catechol addition caused a 31.8% decrease in the hydrogen yield. Phenolic compounds are toxic to organisms and are reported as carcinogenic (Ozkaya, 2006). Xue et al. (2013) evaluated the effect of pentachlorophenol on anaerobic digestion and found that PCP inhibited microorganisms in batch reactor resulting in low biogas production. The aforementioned authors reported that inhibition effect was more serious at higher PCP concentration. The reasons for phenolic inhibition of anaerobic digestion have been given as (1) Extracellular microbial enzymes inhibition. (2) Microbial metabolism inhibition. (3) Substrates deprivation necessary for microbial growth (Hierholtzer et al., 2012). Wikandari et al. (2015) reported that the phenolic compounds in the concentration range of 0.5–5 g/L reduced biogas production by 50%. Similarly, Chapleur et al. (2016) reported that phenol addition severely deteriorated the anaerobic digestion of cellulose with a 50% decrease in microbial activity at 1.40 g/L of phenol. Lo et al. (2012) investigated the effect of BPA on municipal solid waste degradation and found that anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste was inhibited at BPA concentration exceeding 10 mg/L. Akassou et al. (2010) evaluated the effect of polyphenols on anaerobic digestion of wine distillery wastewater with cheese whey and dairy cattle manure and found that catechol had an inhibitory effect on anaerobic digestion at the concentration of 1664 ppm. Lin et al. (2015) evaluated the effect of phenolic compounds viz. syringaldehyde and vanillin on hydrogen production and reported that the hydrogen yield was decreased from 250.6 mL/g to 222.2 mL/g and 215.4 mL/g with the addition of syringaldehyde and vanillin respectively. Inhibition coefficients of phenol inhibitors were estimated using equation (2). With an increase in the concentrations of the phenol inhibitor from 0.5 mg/L to 25 mg/L, the increase in inhibition coefficient was from 14.3% to 60.0%, from 10.7% to 84.6%, from 9.2% to 75.3% and from 7.6% to 63.0% respectively for experimental batches treated with m-cresol, PCP, BPA and catechol (Table 3). The results clearly indicate that PCP caused stronger inhibition of hydrogen production as compared to other inhibitors. The inhibition of microbial growth by phenolic compounds is related to their molecular structure. The phenolic compounds have a non-polar part which promotes their passage through the cell membrane and a hydroxyl group which confers an acidic character to the molecule by combining with a system of delocalization electrons, resulting in destabilization of the cell membrane (Ahmad et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2010). Thus, the activity of phenolic compounds mainly depends on their ability to affect the function of lipoprotein membranes of the cell (Rao et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2008). Furthermore, some reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as OH−, H2O2, and O2 are generated by phenols which induce apoptosis by affecting cell metabolism (Ibraheem and Ndimba, 2013). Gompertz kinetic parameters, hydrogen production rate (Rmax) and lag phase (λ) were found to be dependent on the concentrations of the inhibitors (Table 3). The maximum hydrogen production rates were significantly lower in inhibitors added experimental batches as compared to control. The Rmax decreased from 18.9 ± 2.4 mL/h in control to a minimum of 7.7 ± 2.5 mL/h, 3.0 ± 2.7 mL/h, 4.9 ± 2.5 mL/h and 7.1 ± 2.1 mL/h respectively for experimental batches treated with m-cresol, PCP, BPA and catechol (Table 3). The corresponding increase in lag phase was from 12.6 ± 0.5h in control to a maximum of 16.4 ± 0.4 h, 21.5 ± 0.6 h, 19.2 ± 0.4 h, and 17.8 ± 0.4 h. The hydrogen content in the gas composition ranged from 37.4 ± 1.7% to 58.9 ± 1.8%, from 15.1 ± 1.3% to 28.9 ± 1.5%, from 21.6 ± 1.3% to 39.7 ± 1.8% and from 31.5 ± 1.4% to 44.9 ± 1.6% respectively for experimental batches treated with m-cresol, PCP, BPA, and catechol. The rest of the gaseous composition consisted of carbon dioxide. Methane was not detected in the gaseous samples."
10,Effect of phenol inhibitors on COD removal,"3.2 Effect of phenol inhibitors on COD removal Table 4 shows that COD removal efficiency of phenol inhibitors treated experimental batches is significantly lower than the control. In control, 41.2 ± 1.2% COD removal efficiency was achieved which declined to a minimum of 22.6 ± 1.7%, 10.3 ± 1.4%, 15.5 ± 1.2% and 18.6 ± 1.8% respectively for the experimental batches treated with m-cresol, PCP, BPA and catechol at a concentration of 5 mg/L (Table 4). Phenols are low molecular weight compounds which weaken cell integrity and affect selective barrier and enzyme matrices of the cell membrane which results in the reduced cell growth (Cortez and Roberto, 2010; Behera et al., 2014). Camarillo and Rincon (2009) evaluated the effect of inhibitory compounds on anaerobic digestion of waste-water from alimentary industry and found that phenol at the concentration of 150 mg/L almost completely inhibited anaerobic digestion and COD removal. The contribution of the different fraction of the substrate in hydrogen production was estimated (Tawfik and El-Qelish, 2012). For COD removal, the largest portion of carbohydrates was utilized while lipids and proteins had relatively smaller contributions (Table 4). Carbohydrates contributed from 69.8 ± 1.6% to 78.6 ± 1.3%, from 68.3 ± 1.1% to 79.1 ± 1.3%, from 71.5 ± 1.5% to 78.7 ± 1.8% and from 70.8 ± 1.3% to 78.3 ± 1.8% respectively for experimental batches treated with m-cresol, PCP, BPA and catechol (Table 4). The contribution of proteins for COD removal was from 3.2 ± 1.3% to 7.8 ± 1.7%, from 4.2 ± 1.2% to 7.3 ± 1.8%, from 2.7 ± 1.7% to 9.8 ± 1.5% and 5.1 ± 1.1% to 9.1 ± 1.8% while lipid contributed from 14.2 ± 1.3% to 21.6 ± 1.3%, from 15.7 ± 1.2% to 24.3 ± 1.3%, from 10.6 ± 1.8% to 24.5 ± 1.2% and from 14.5 ± 1.6% to 20.1 ± 1.4% respectively for experimental batches treated with m-cresol, PCP, BPA and catechol (Table 4)."
11,Inhibitors removal,"3.3 Inhibitors removal Phenol inhibitors affect the microbial metabolism. These inhibitory chemicals are converted into less inhibitory by-products by the microorganisms as long as their concentrations remain below a threshold inhibitory level (Boopathy et al., 1993). The degradation level of phenol inhibitors during fermentation has been shown in Fig. 2 . The results clearly indicate that at low concentration of 0.25 mg/L, 100% removal was achieved for every inhibitor applied. However, as the inhibitors concentration was increased, their removal efficiency was declined (Fig. 2). Xue et al. (2013) observed a 94.6% removal of PCP at the concentration of 14.9 mg/L which declined to 54.8% at PCP concentration of 29.5 mg/L. Chakraborty et al. (2010) isolated microbes from coke-oven waste-water and used them for phenol degradation. The aforementioned authors used phenol concentration of 200 mg/L and reported a 76.76% removal of phenol at optimal conditions. It has been suggested that the inhibitors degrade in their corresponding alcohols during fermentation (Behera et al., 2014). The reduction of inhibitors in anaerobic digestion is attributed to NADP coupled reductive enzymes in microbes (Ask et al., 2013). Thus, inhibitors supplementation reduced NADH level available for hydrogen generation which resulted in the decline of hydrogen production."
12,Volatile fatty acids,"3.4 Volatile fatty acids Fig. 3 shows volatile fatty acid generation at different concentrations of phenol inhibitors. Volatile fatty acid generation was lowered by phenol inhibitors which resulted in low hydrogen yield. At low concentrations of inhibitors, the most dominating volatile fatty acid in all experimental batches was butyrate followed by acetate while propionate was present in fewer amounts. Similar results were found by Fangkum and Reungsang (2011) who produced hydrogen from the hydrolysate of sugarcane bagasse using elephant dung as inoculums and reported that dominant volatile fatty acids were butyrate followed by acetate. Quememeur et al. (2012) conducted experiments for hydrogen production from xylose as a carbon source using anaerobic mixed culture and reported a high HBu/TVFAs ratio of 49.7% as compared to 33.3% HAc/TVFAs in control. However, in the present study as the concentration of inhibitors was increased butyrate and acetate concentration started declining while propionate started increasing (Fig. 3). In control, the concentration of butyrate was 3.92 g/L which decreased to a minimum of 3.55 g/L, 2.11 g/L, 2.26 g/L and 3.35 g/L respectively for m-cresol, pentachlorophenol, bisphenol-A and catechol at the concentration of 25 mg/L. Acetate concentration in the control was 2.89 g/L which decreased to 2.45 g/L, 2.22 g/L, 1.57 g/L and 2.32 g/L respectively for m-cresol, pentachlorophenol, bisphenol-A and catechol at the concentration of 25 mg/L. Propionate increased from 0.96 g/L in control to a maximum of 2.58 g/L, 5.78 g/L, 4.78 g/L and 3.24 g/L respectively for m-cresol, pentachlorophenol, bisphenol-A and catechol concentration of 25 mg/L (Fig. 3a–c). This shows that at the lower dosages of phenolic compounds, butyrate type fermentation was dominant pathway which shifted to propionate type at the higher concentration of inhibitors. Similar results were observed by Xue et al. (2013) who reported that pentachlorophenol addition transformed the fermentation type of system from butyric acid type to propionic acid type. The hydrogen producing fermentation process is thermodynamically affected by the lack or accumulation of volatile fatty acids (Mizuno et al., 2000). Therefore, a fluctuation of volatile fatty acids was influenced by the presence of phenolic inhibitors."
13,Conclusion,"The presence of phenolic compounds greatly affected hydrogen production and yield. The decline in hydrogen production was recorded at every concentration of inhibitors applied. Pentachlorophenol showed maximum inhibition with the highest inhibition coefficient of 84.6%. Soluble metabolite analysis revealed that at a lower concentration of phenolic compounds, the dominant volatile fatty acids were butyrate and acetate while at higher concentrations, the metabolic pathway shifted to propionate type. Therefore, removal of phenolic compounds from feedstock prior to fermentation is recommended to improve the hydrogen yield. Furthermore, investigation of other potentially toxic phenolic compounds is recommended."
