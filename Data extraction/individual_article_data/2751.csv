0,Introduction,"Selective oxidations of primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes (or carboxylic acids) and ketones, respectively, are pivotal reactions in organic synthesis. Traditional methods involve stoichiometric inorganic or organic oxidants such as hexavalent chromium, manganese dioxide or the Swern or Dess-Martin reagents, respectively [1]. Although such methods have broad scope they are very atom inefficient, involve the use of toxic and/or hazardous reagents and generate copious amounts of inorganic or organic waste. Consequently, there is an on-going quest for sustainable catalytic technologies, with broad substrate scope, using oxygen or hydrogen peroxide as the primary oxidants [2,3]. However, hypochlorite is widely favored as an oxidant in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, rather than oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, because of the potential explosion hazards associated with the use of the latter oxidants. We note, however, that the use of water as an inert, non-inflammable solvent alleviates this problem. Nonetheless, hypochlorite is inexpensive and the relatively low tonnages involved in pharma and fine chemicals mean that the generation of one or more equivalents of sodium chloride waste is not really an issue. Similarly, the use of environmentally unfriendly organic solvents as reaction media should, where possible, be avoided. In this context, water has several advantages: it is abundantly available, inexpensive, odorless, non-toxic and non-inflammable. Indeed, a variety of commercially important catalytic processes, such as hydrogenation, carbonylation, hydroformylation, olefin metathesis, polymerization and telomerization, is already performed in an aqueous medium at industrial scale [4]. These processes generally involve catalysis by low-valent transition metal complexes of phosphine ligands, and organometallic compounds as key intermediates. Replacement of the hydrophobic phosphine ligands used in organic media with highly water soluble hydrophilic equivalents, e.g. sulfonated triarylphosphines, allows such reactions to be conducted in aqueous/organic biphasic media. In contrast, catalytic oxidations generally involve transition metals in high oxidation states, coordinated to relatively simple hard nitrogen and/or oxygen-containing ligands, and coordination complexes as reactive intermediates. For example, in heme-dependent oxygenase and peroxidase enzymes active high-valent oxoiron intermediates are stabilized by coordination to a macrocyclic porphyrin ligand in the active site of the enzyme. Strong coordination of water to the hard metal center can suppress coordination of hydrophobic substrates, resulting in catalyst inhibition or deactivation by hydrolysis. Another distinguishing feature of catalytic oxidations ensues from the susceptibility of most organic ligands to degradation under oxidizing conditions. For this reason, readily oxidizable phosphines are not suitable ligands for oxidation catalysts. The aerobic oxidation of water soluble alcohols, diols and carbohydrates, over heterogeneous noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ru) in aqueous media has been extensively studied and dates back to the introduction of the term catalysis by Berzelius in the early 19th century [5,6]. The current drive toward the replacement of petroleum hydrocarbon feedstocks, derived from fossil resources, by carbohydrates derived from renewable raw materials [7] is stimulating a renaissance in catalytic oxidations of carbohydrate feedstocks and water is definitely the solvent of choice for these reactions. In the oxidation of alcohol substrates which are sparingly soluble in water two strategies have been employed for catalyzing oxidation in an aqueous/organic biphasic system. In the first category the substrate is dissolved in, or forms itself, an organic phase while the oxidant, and possibly also the catalyst, resides in the aqueous phase. A phase transfer agent is employed to transfer the catalyst and/or oxidant to the organic phase where the reaction takes place. Many catalytic oxidations with water soluble oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite and persulfate, fall into this category. In the second category the substrate is contained in a separate organic phase and the catalyst and oxidant are dissolved in the water phase where the reaction takes place. The product is separated as the organic phase and the catalyst, contained in the aqueous phase, is easily recovered and recycled. In this review we shall focus on the use of four types of catalyst: (a) water soluble metal salts and complexes, (b) metal nanoparticles as hybrid species at the interface of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis [8], (c) water soluble organocatalysts such as stable N-oxy radicals [9], and (d) enzymes [3g] in the oxidation of simple alcohols and, to a lesser extent, diols and carbohydrates."
1,Water soluble ligands,"A selection of water soluble ligands that have been used in catalytic oxidations with oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is shown in Fig. 1 . Early work generally involved biomimetic oxidations employing water soluble derivatives of porphyrins 1 and the structurally related phthalocyanines 2 [10]. A major issue associated with the use of porphyrins and, to a lesser extent, phthalocyanines is, in addition to their cost, their susceptibility toward oxidative degradation. In vivo the ligand can be replenished by intracellular synthesis by the host microorganism but this is not an option in vitro. Consequently, there is a definite need for oxidatively stable macrocyclic ligands. This led Collins and coworkers [11,12] to develop a series of iron(III) complexes of oxidatively and hydrolytically stable tetraamido macrocyclic ligands (TAMLs) of general structure 3, which are efficient activators of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, over a broad pH range. They have a variety of potential uses, e.g. to replace chlorine bleaching in the pulp and paper industry and in waste water treatment but applications in organic synthesis have, to our knowledge, not been reported. In the last decade a variety of water soluble metal complexes of chelating diamine and pyridine carboxylate-type ligands (see Fig. 1 for examples) have become popular as catalysts for catalytic oxidations in aqueous media."
2,Tungsten and vanadium catalysts,"DiFuria and Modena and coworkers [13] were the first to report the tungstate catalyzed oxidation of alcohols with aqueous hydrogen peroxide, in a biphasic system composed of water and 1,2-dichloroethane using a tetraalkylammonium salt as a phase transfer agent. Noyori and coworkers [14,15] optimized this methodology to afford an extremely effective, chloride- and organic solvent-free system using 1.1equiv. of 30% H2O2 at 90°C and the lipophilic methyltrioctylammonium bisulfate, [CH3(n-C8H17)3N]+HSO4 −, as a phase transfer agent (Fig. 2 ). Substrate catalyst ratios as high as 400.000 were used, affording turnover numbers up to 180.000. The active oxidant is a tetraalkylammonium pertungstate. A wide variety of secondary alcohols, including unsaturated alcohols, afforded the corresponding ketones in high yields. Primary alcohols gave the corresponding carboxylic acid in high yields via further oxidation of the hydrate of the intermediate aldehyde. Subsequently, Shi and Wei [16] reported the use of bis-quaternary phosphonium pertungstates or permolybdates for the selective oxidation of cyclohexanol and benzyl alcohol, to cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde or benzoic acid, respectively, under halide- and organic solvent-free conditions with 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, Neumann and coworkers [17] described the use of a hydrolytically and oxidatively stable sandwich type tungsten polyoxometalate (POM) catalyst, Na12[WZn3(H2O)2][(ZnW9O34)2], in the oxidation of alcohols with hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous biphasic medium without any added organic solvent. The catalyst was prepared from a mixture of the POM, branched polyethyleneimine (MW 600) and an octylamine-epichlorohydrin cross-linking reagent. In a further elaboration, Ikegami and coworkers [18] reported the use of a recyclable, thermoresponsive tungsten catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols with hydrogen peroxide in water. The catalyst consisted of a PNIPAM-based copolymer containing pendant tetraalkylammonium cations and a heteropolytungstate, PW12O40 3−, counter anion (see Fig. 2). At room temperature the substrate and the aqueous hydrogen peroxide, containing the catalyst in the form of micelles, formed distinct separate phases. On heating the mixture to 90°C a stable emulsion was formed, in which the reaction took place with as little as 0.1mol% catalyst. Subsequent cooling of the reaction mixture to room temperature resulted in precipitation of the catalyst as micelles which could be removed by filtration and recycled. More recently, Wang and coworkers [19] employed a self-assembled, mesoporous hybrid polyoxotungstate – guanidinium ionic liquid catalyst (see Fig. 2) in the triphasic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. During the reaction, the triphase catalytic system showed a special “on water” effect which was ascribed to the mesoporous structure and surface wettability of the catalyst. Ogawa and coworkers [20] recently reported the aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols in water, at 90°C and 0.1MPa O2, using 5mol% of an oxovanadium(IV) complex of 4,4/-di-tert-butyl bipyridine, 10, as the catalyst (Fig. 3 ). Other bipyridine ligands were tested but the di-tert-butyl bipyridine gave the best results."
3,Palladium(II) catalysts,"The palladium(II) catalyzed aerobic oxidation of alcohols has been extensively studied [21]. A general drawback of Pd catalysts is that slow reoxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II) results in the agglomeration of the Pd(0) particles to palladium black with accompanying catalyst deactivation. In the well-known Wacker process for the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde this problem is circumvented by adding copper(II) as a cocatalyst [22]. The latter reoxidizes the Pd(0) to Pd(II) with concomitant formation of Cu(I) which, in turn, is reoxidized by dioxygen to complete the catalytic cycle. In a continuation of studies [23] of Pd(II) complexes of sulfonated phosphines as catalysts for carbonylations in aqueous biphasic media, Pd(II) complexes of analogous water-soluble diamine ligands, such as the commercially available sulfonated bathophenanthroline (4a), were shown to be active and stable catalysts for aerobic oxidations of alcohols and olefins in aqueous biphasic media [24–26]. This and related ligands are able to stabilize transient Pd(0) species under oxidizing conditions, thus suppressing the formation of palladium black. With water immiscible alcohols the organic phase consists of the alcohol substrate and the carbonyl product (Fig. 4 ). Reactions were generally complete in 5h at 100°C/3MPa air with as little as 0.25mol% catalyst. No organic solvent is required (unless the substrate is a solid) and the product is easily recovered by phase separation. The catalyst is stable and remains in the aqueous phase, facilitating recycling to the next batch. A wide range of primary and secondary alcohols were oxidized with turnover frequencies ranging from 10 to 100h−1. The alcohol must be at least sparingly soluble in water as the reaction occurs in the water phase. Secondary alcohols afforded the corresponding ketones in >99% selectivity in virtually all cases studied. Primary alcohols afforded the corresponding carboxylic acids via further oxidation of the initially formed aldehyde, e.g. 1-hexanol afforded 1-hexanoic acid in 95% yield, and without the necessity to neutralize the carboxylic acid product with one equivalent of base. Alternatively, the aldehyde could be obtained in high yield by conducting the reaction in the presence of 1mol% of the stable free radical, TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl), which suppressed over-oxidation. A plausible catalytic cycle [25], consistent with the observed half-order in palladium, involves initial dissociation of a hydroxyl bridged palladium(II) dimer to afford the monomer as the active catalyst. Coordination of the alcohol substrate and β-hydrogen elimination affords the carbonyl product and palladium(0) which is re-oxidized to palladium(II) by dioxygen. Further evidence in support of this mechanism has been reported by Stahl and coworkers [27]. The Pd-bathophenanthroline system is an order of magnitude more reactive than hitherto reported catalytic methods for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. It requires no organic solvent, involves simple product isolation and catalyst recycling by phase separation. The reaction rate increases with electron-donating substituents in the alcohol substrate and electron-withdrawing substituents in the ligand, in accordance with the putative mechanism [28]. Buffin and coworkers [29] observed similar electronic effects in a study of the structurally related Pd(II) complexes of the biquinoline ligand (6) as catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols in water. The scope in organic synthesis of the Pd-bathophenanthroline system is limited by its low tolerance for substrates containing heteroatom functional groups, e.g. N or S, which coordinate strongly to palladium. Since the putative active catalyst is a monomeric species, formed by dissociation of the hydroxyl-bridged dimer in solution, substitution at the 2 and 9 positions in the phenanthroline ring should create steric crowding in the dimer and favor its dissociation and, hence, increase the overall activity. Accordingly, the bathophenanthroline (4a) bathocuproin sulfonate (4b) and neocuproin complexes (5) of Pd(II) exhibited TOFs of 50, 150 and 1800h−1, respectively, in the oxidation of 2-hexanol (Fig. 5 ), although the reaction with the neocuproin complex was performed in 50/50 (v/v) DMSO/water while the reactions with bathophenanthroline and bathocuproin sulfonates were performed in water [30]. The Pd((II) neocuproin catalyzed oxidations were performed in 1:1 mixtures of water and DMSO or ethylene carbonate at low catalyst loadings (0.1mol%) with TOFs of >1500h−1. The system also tolerates a wide variety of O, N, and S-containing functional groups in the alcohol substrate. More recently, Muldoon and coworkers [31] showed that Pd (II) complexes of anionic N,O-chelating ligands such as 7–9, were highly active catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of 2-octanol to 2-octanone at 100°C and 4.5MPa O2/N2 (8:92), with TOFs up to 1500h−1 using a catalyst loading of 0.1–0.2mol%. The reactions were conducted with the neat alcohol but the reaction could, presumably, be performed in an aqueous biphasic medium."
4,Noble metal nanoparticles as quasi homogeneous catalysts,"A more detailed comparison of the Pd(II) bathophenthroline and Pd(II) neocuproin complexes revealed a remarkable difference in the oxidation of the unsaturated alcohol substrate shown in Fig. 5. With the former, Wacker-type oxidation of the olefinic double bond was primarily observed while the latter underwent highly selective (>99%) oxidation of the alcohol moiety [32]. The latter result is consistent with the pioneering work of Moiseev and coworkers [33] who showed that giant Pd clusters (nowadays known as Pd nanoparticles) catalyze the oxidation of alcohol moieties and selectively oxidize allylic CH bonds in olefins. Indeed, further investigation [32] of the Pd(II) neocuproin complex revealed that it dissociates completely, under the reaction conditions, to afford Pd nanoparticles which are the actual catalyst. In an interesting variant on this theme Pd nanoparticles were confined within the protein core of a highly stable ferritin from the hyperthermophilic bacterium, Pyrococcus furiosus. Ferritin is an iron transport protein, one molecule of which can contain up to 4055 iron atoms stored as [FeO(OH)]8[FeO(H2PO4)]. Apo-ferritin, obtained by removing the iron salts, was incubated with a Pd(II) salt, followed by size exclusion chromatographic purification and hydrogenation of the Pd(II) loaded ferritin to generate a novel nanopalladium-protein hybrid. The latter proved to be an efficient and robust catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols in water at 80°C [34]. Following on from the pioneering studies of Rossi and coworkers [35] on the use of Au nanoparticles as catalysts for the aerobic carbohydrate oxidations, such as glucose to gluconic acid in aqueous media, various supported nanoparticles, e.g. Au-on-CeO2 [36], Au-on-Mg2AlO4 [37], Au-on-hydrotalcite [38], Pd-on-hydroxyapatite [39] and Pd–Au-on-TiO2 [40] were shown to be excellent catalysts for alcohol oxidations [41]. The reactions were performed successfully in organic solvents or solvent-free as well as in water. For example, Christensen and coworkers reported the aerobic oxidation of aqueous (bio) ethanol to acetic acid over Au-on-Mg2AlO4 [37]. When the oxidation was performed in methanol the methyl ester of the corresponding carboxylic acid was obtained. Supported Au nanoparticles have also been used for the selective oxidation of renewable raw materials, such as glycerol, furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural [37,42]. Mono- and bi-metallic nanoparticles are also stabilized by immobilization in polymer matrices, affording ‘quasi homogeneous catalysts’ for aerobic alcohol oxidations in water. Examples include Au and Pd nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked N,N-dimethylacrylamide-based microgels [43], Au dispersed in the stabilizing hydrophilic poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone [44], Au incarcerated in a polystyrene matrix [45] and Pd [46] or Pt [47] nanoparticles dispersed in an amphiphilic polystyrene-(poly) ethylene glycol resin. In a further elaboration pre-formed, polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilized Au–Pd nanoparticles were entrapped in a porous polyimide membrane [48]. Palladium nanoparticles confined in the nanocages of the mesoporous silica, SBA-16 catalyzed the aerobic oxidation of alcohols at room temperature in water [49]. Another interesting variation on this theme is the use of Au nanoparticles, stabilized by the redox active, water soluble poly (aniline sulfonic acid), as a catalyst for aerobic alcohol oxidation [50]."
5,Stable N-oxy radicals as organocatalysts,"The stable free radical, TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) is an example of an organocatalyst that is effective in the oxidation of a broad range of alcohols [51], including simple carbohydrates [52] and polysaccharides [53], using hypochlorite (household bleach) as the terminal oxidant. The method was first described in 1987 by Montanari and coworkers [54] who used 4-methoxy TEMPO as the catalyst and has been widely applied in organic synthesis [9,55]. Typically, 1mol% TEMPO or a derivative thereof is used in combination with 10mol% sodium bromide as cocatalyst, in dichloromethane/water at pH 9 and 0°C (Fig. 6 ). More recently, environmentally acceptable ester solvents, notably methyl acetate and isopropyl acetate, were shown to give results [56] comparable to or better than dichloromethane. The active oxidant is the oxoammonium cation, formed by oxidation of TEMPO by chlorine or bromine, which is regenerated in the catalytic cycle by reaction of the reduced TEMPOH with the primary oxidant (hypochlorite). Although only 1mol% is used in the Montanari protocol, TEMPO is rather expensive, and efficient recycling is, hence, an important consideration. It can be replaced by a recyclable oligomeric TEMPO, referred to as PIPO (polymer-immobilized piperidinyloxyl) which is derived from the commercially available antioxidant and light stabilizer, chimassorb 944, an oligomeric sterically hindered amine (see Fig. 6). PIPO proved to be a very effective and recyclable catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols, including a wide variety of carbohydrates, with hypochlorite in a bromide- and chlorinated hydrocarbon-free system [57–59]. The reaction is performed with 1mol% of PIPO and 1.25 equivalents of NaOCl in water as the sole solvent or in a water/methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) mixture. Other methods have also been described for the immobilization of TEMPO derivatives, e.g. by attachment to a Merrifield polystryrene resin [60] or functionalized silica, commercialized under the name Fibercat TEMPO by Johnson Matthey [61,62]. In another variation on this theme, a so-called ion-supported TEMPO was synthesized by building a TEMPO moiety into the side chain of a dialkylimidazolium salt (see Fig. 6). The resulting material catalyzed the oxidation of alcohols with NaOCl or I2 in water or an ionic liquid/water mixture [63]. Alternatively, immobilization on magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles provides the possibility of recovering the TEMPO catalyst magnetically [64]. In the case of large volume products the industrial potential would be significantly enhanced by replacing the hypochlorite by dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide. Copper complexes of bipyridine ligands, in combination with TEMPO and a base, were shown to catalyze the selective aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols, to the corresponding aldehydes, in aqueous acetonitrile [65–69]. Based largely on kinetic studies, a mechanism (Fig. 7 ) was proposed [70] which is analogous to that involved in the aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols catalyzed by the copper-dependent oxidase, galactose oxidase. This copper centered dehydrogenation mechanism, in which a copper coordinated TEMPO ligand plays the same role as a coordinated tyrosine radical in the galactose oxidase mechanism, differs totally from the oxoammonium type mechanism originally proposed by Semmelhack [71] for the Cu/TEMPO system. The aerobic Cu/TEMPO system was further improved by using air-microbubble techniques to facilitate gas absorption into the liquid phase [72]. It was also shown [73] that Cu(I) salts give better results than Cu(II) salts in a system using TEMPO and bipy in combination with N-methylimidazole as a base. Furthermore, extensive mechanistic studies performed by Stahl and coworkers [68,74] confirmed the copper-centered galactose oxidase-like mechanism for these systems. The absence of hydrogen atoms at the α-carbon atom in sterically hindered N-oxy radicals such as TEMPO prevents their degradation via elimination reactions. More recently, attention has been drawn to the use of sterically unhindered nitroxyl radicals such as AZADO [75,76] and ABNO [77,78], and derivatives thereof (Fig. 8 ), which possess α-hydrogens but are nonetheless stable toward elimination because the resulting double bond would be formed at a bridgehead and, hence, violate Bredt's rule [79]. It was already known that such unhindered radicals react faster than TEMPO but, more importantly, they are able to oxidize more sterically demanding alcohols that exhibit low reactivity toward TEMPO-based systems. As noted above, the Cu/TEMPO/bipy system is very selective for primary alcohols. Secondary alcohols are much less reactive, which was attributed to steric hindrance in the abstraction of an α-hydrogen atom from a coordinated alkoxide by a coordinated TEMPO ligand. In contrast, it was recently shown [77,78] that an analogous Cu (I)/ABNO can effectively oxidize a variety of secondary alcohols, including sterically demanding ones such as menthol. Similarly, Iwabushi and coworkers [80] recently showed that the Cu/AZADO system is active in the aerobic oxidation of a variety of unprotected amino alcohols. Interestingly, Ji and coworkers [81] recently showed that a ligand- and additive-free system comprising Cu(OAc)2/TEMPO (1mol%) was able to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of a variety of primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones, respectively, at ambient temperature in acetonitrile/water (1:2, v/v). Although the copper/N-oxy radical systems are by far the most studied, other metals, including iron, cobalt, manganese and vanadium, in combination with TEMPO, have also been reported [69]. The Fe/TEMPO system, for example, has not yet been subjected to rigorous mechanistic investigation but, on the basis of the economic and environmental benefits of using iron-based catalysts, it would seem to be worthy of further investigation. Many of the iron/TEMPO systems studied have been with Fe(NO3)3 or with added NaNO2 or NaNO3 [69] and such systems can involve reoxidation of the reduced TEMPO by NO2 and O2 as the terminal oxidant (Fig. 9 ). Similarly, Tong and coworkers [82] have reported highly efficient and selective aerobic oxidation of alcohols using a catalyst comprising TEMPO (1–3mol%), ceric ammonium nitrate (5mol%) and sodium nitrite (10mol%), in water as solvent. The cheapest source of NO2 is nitric acid and systems have been described [83–85] which utilize TEMPO/HNO3 in the absence of added metals, i.e. transition metal-free systems. Hypervalent iodine compounds, in stoichiometric amounts, are known to oxidize alcohols and the use of iodosyl benzene or a polymer-supported iodine (III) reagent, in combination with KBr as a cocatalyst, for the oxidation of alcohols in water has been described [86]. More recently a related catalytic system, consisting of PhIO2 (2mol%), Br2 (2mol%) and NaNO2 (1mol%),for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols in water at 55°C was reported [87]."
6,Enzymatic oxidation of alcohols,"Oxidoreductases are divided into four categories on the basis of reaction type. Dehydrogenases and (mono)oxygenases are cofactor dependent, that is they consume a stoichiometric amount of a nicotinamide cofactor (NAD or NADP) that has to be regenerated in order to be catalytic in cofactor. Oxidases and peroxidases, in contrast, catalyze oxidations with dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, without the need for a cofactor. In the context of alcohol oxidations we shall be mainly concerned with oxidases [88], which catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols by dioxygen, affording the corresponding carbonyl compound and hydrogen peroxide or water. There are two major types: copper-dependent oxidases, exemplified by galactose oxidase and laccase, and flavin-dependent oxidases, such as glucose oxidase. Alcohol dehydrogenases are widely applied in organic synthesis but mostly as ketoreductases (KREDs) in the reverse reaction, i.e. the enantioselective reduction of ketones. However, recently they have been studied as possible catalysts, in conjunction with regeneration of the oxidized cofactor with dioxygen and a second enzyme, for the oxidation of alcohols [89]. Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are extracellular, copper-dependent oxidases that are secreted by white rot fungi and play an important role in the delignification of lignocelluloses [90]. There is currently considerable commercial interest in laccases for application in pulp bleaching (as a replacement for chlorine) in paper manufacture and remediation of phenol-containing waste streams [91]. Galli and coworkers [92] were the first to show that laccase, in combination with TEMPO as a cocatalyst, catalyzed the selective aerobic oxidation of primary benzylic alcohols to the corresponding benzaldehydes but 30mol% of TEMPO was required. It was subsequently shown [93] that these reactions involve one-electron oxidation of the TEMPO, or a derivative thereof, by the oxidized form of the laccase to afford the oxoammonium cation, followed by reoxidation of the reduced form of laccase by dioxygen (Fig. 10 ). 10mol% of TEMPO was sufficient to give good conversions and excellent selectivities [94] but further reduction of the catalyst loading is necessary for large-scale use of this system. More recently, the laccase/TEMPO system was shown [95] to catalyze the oxidation of 1,4 and 1,5-diols to the corresponding lactones (Fig. 11 ). The enzyme could be recycled by immobilizing it as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) [96]. The laccase/TEMPO system also catalyzed the aerobic oxidation of the renewable diols, isosorbide and isomannide, affording the corresponding diketones (Fig. 11) in >99% yield [97]. The corresponding diamines, produced by reductive amination of the diketones, are of interest as starting materials for the production of bio-based polymers, e.g. polyamides. Especially the oxidation of isosorbide is surprising because of the low reactivity of the shielded endo OH group in isosorbide. Similarly, laccase/TEMPO catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of the primary alcohol moieties in starch, to give the corresponding carboxylic acid moieties [98]. The product, carboxystarch, has potential applications as a biodegradable water super absorbent but the relatively high enzyme costs form an obstacle to commercialization. Inefficient laccase use is a direct result of its instability toward the oxidizing reaction conditions. Here again, the stability of the laccase under reaction conditions was improved by immobilization [99] as a cross-linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) [100] thus removing reactive amino groups from the surface of the enzyme."
7,Conclusions and future outlook,"Important advances continue to be made in the design of catalytic oxidations of alcohols with the green oxidants, dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide, in aqueous mono- or biphasic systems, in the absence of organic solvents. They constitute attractive green alternatives to traditional oxidations employing atom inefficient stoichiometric oxidants in organic media and are, therefore finding wide application in industrial organic synthesis. They have several economic and environmental benefits: clean oxidants, no need for organic solvents, facile product separation and catalyst recycling. On the one hand, there is a marked trend toward the use of complexes of inexpensive and more environmentally acceptable first row elements (Fe, Mn and Cu) rather than noble metal complexes as catalysts. On the other hand, noble metal (particularly Au) nanoparticles as catalysts for aerobic oxidations of, inter alia, simple alcohols and polyols, are receiving increasing attention. Methods based on stable N-oxy radicals as organocatalysts for alcohol oxidations are also gaining in popularity, mainly owing to the fact that they are ‘heavy metal-free’. Similarly, enzymatic oxidations are in ascendence as more and better oxidases become commercially available in both free and immobilized forms. Finally, we expect that the mounting interest in the selective conversion of renewable carbohydrate feedstocks to commodity chemicals will further stimulate developments in the selective aerobic oxidation of alcohol functionalities in aqueous media in the future."
