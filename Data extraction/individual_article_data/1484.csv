0,Introduction,"Photocatalysis, a technology driven by solar energy, has attracted extensive attentions in energy and environmental fields due to its advantages of simple operation, economic-effectively, environmental friendly and mild reaction conditions [1,2]. In this technology, the development of low-cost, easy to prepare and efficient photocatalyst is significantly crucial. Graphite phase carbon nitride (CN), a metal free organic semiconductor photocatalyst, has the merits of easy to preparation, available raw materials, green preparation process, stable physicochemical properties, narrow band gap (about 2.7 eV) and adjustable energy band structure, etc. [3,4]. Although CN has been broadly applied in the photodegradation of organic pollutants and hydrogen production, it often suffers from limited specific surface area, less exposure of active sites, low utilization of sunlight, and easy recombination of photogenerated electrons-holes. Generally, researchers via regulating morphology [5–7], constructing heterojunction [8–11], constructing defects [12,13], doping [12,14–16] or integrated strategies to overcome the shortcomings of pristine CN. Among them, doping, involving small molecule (e.g., 4-diphenylphosphinobenzoic acid [17], salicylic acid [15], acetylacetone [18], p-iodobenzaldehyde [19]), heteroatom (e.g., nonmetal [20–22] or metallic [23]), polymer (e.g., urea formaldehyde resin [24], melamine formaldehyde resin [25]), has been proved to be an effective strategy to adjust the morphology, optical absorption and photogenerated carrier recombination of CN materials, so as to improve photocatalytic performance [26–30]. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a kind of cationic polymer and riches in multistage amino groups [12]. Recently, PEI has been used to reduce the work function of the electrode and adjust the local electronic environment of carbon nanotube or graphene to enhance the electrochemical oxygen reduction or water oxidation reaction [31]. When it comes to CN photocatalyst, Zhang’ group modified PEI on the pre-synthesized CN via facile electrostatic action to boost the photocatalytic disinfection activity [32] and the photocatalytic H2O2 production [33] of CN. Experimental results demonstrated that the modification of PEI can tune the local electronic environment of CN, improves the electron-hole separation. However, the photocatalyst fabricated by electrostatic adhesion may have the problem of poor stability, while the integrated CN by doping to form the CN framework will overcome the above defects. Recently, by simply doping the PEI into the skeleton of CN, Huo’s group constructed an integrated CN with fast charge transfer and enhanced light utilization efficiency [12]. In that research, the midgap states and amino groups generated by the dope of PEI was utilized to synergistic photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels. It is necessary to further optimize this strategy and explore the application potential of this kind of integrated CN materials in water pollution removal and energy production fields. Considering the advantages of doping, integrated CN and the improved photocatalytic performance bringing by PEI, an integrated CN photocatalyst with enhanced photocatalytic performance was constructed via thermal-induce copolymerization of PEI precursor with urea. The structure, morphology, crystallinity and photoelectric properties of the photocatalysts were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV–vis DRS and PL, etc.. The PEI doped integrated CN photocatalyst was used to photocatalytic degradation of TC and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Urea, tetracycline (TC), triethanolamine (TEOA), polyethyleneimine (PEI, M.W. = 10000, 50% aqueous solution) were bought from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Ascorbic acid (L-AA), isopropanol (IPA), ethyl alcohol, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) and EDTA-2Na were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of photocatalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of photocatalyst The photocatalysts were fabricated by a simple one-pot thermally induced polymerization. Specifically, 20 g of urea and × mg of PEI (x = 5, 14, 32.5, 50 or 75) were mixed and heated at 150 °C to obtain a clear solution. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was placed in muffle furnace and heated to 600 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid is ground into powder and labeled as xPCN. The pristine CN photocatalyst was synthesized by the same way without adding PEI and labeled as CN."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystallization properties of CN and xPCN were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU, D/max-2500). The functional groups of the photocatalysts were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, thermoscientific Nicolet 4700). The morphology and microstructure were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi regulus8100) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV–vis DRS) were obtained by ESCALAB250XI electronic spectrometer (VG scientific, USA) and Cary 500 spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2550, Japan), respectively. Photoluminescence (PL), photocurrent response (PCR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were characterized by F4500 (Hitachi, Japan) photoluminescence detector, CHI760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.) and PGSTAT-302 N (metrohm China Ltd.) electrochemical workstation, respectively."
5,Photocatalytic degradation,"2.4 Photocatalytic degradation The TC was employed as probe contaminants to investigate activity of photocatalysts, where 300 W Xe lamp and cut-off filter were used to filter ultraviolet light (λ < 420 nm) and served as visible light source. In a typical photocatalytic degradation process, the TC aqueous solution (40 mg L-1, 50 mL) containing 20 mg photocatalyst was stirred in the dark for 40 min to achieve the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. After turning on the lamp, 2 mL of mixture was taken out in certain time intervals, and the supernatant was analyzed by UV-2700 UV–vis spectrophotometer at 358 nm. To confirm the active substances produced in degradation process, the capture experiments were conducted. The processes were similar to the photocatalytic degradation experiment, except that 1 mmol L-1 of IPA, L-AA and EDTA-2Na were added as quenchers to capture ·OH,·O2 – and h+, respectively."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The activity of photocatalysts was further investigated by photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments at atmospheric atmosphere (PLS-SXE 300/300UV, Beijing Zhongjiaojinyuan Technology Co. Ltd, China). In brief, 30 mg photocatalyst was evenly dispersed into the mixture of 30 mL aqueous solution containing 10 vol% TEOA and 3 wt% Pt (produced by H2PtCl6·6H2O). A Xe lamp (350 W, λ > 420 nm) was used as visible-light source. Before illumination, the air in the reaction system was discharged with argon, and the whole reaction temperature was maintained at 18.5 °C by circulating water."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and composition,"3.1 Structure and composition The crystal structures of CN and xPCN were analyzed by XRD. As presented in Fig. 1 a, there are two obvious peaks around 27.5° (002) and 13.1° (001) for all samples, which correspond to the interlayer-stacking peak and in-plane peak of typical CN systems (JCPDS no. 85-1326) [34,35], respectively. In addition, compared with CN (Fig. 1 b), the interlayer-stacking peak gradually became broader and weaker with the increase of PEI contents in xPCN, suggested that the stacking sequence of CN deteriorated to some extent during the thermal-polymerization process [18]. The FTIR spectra of CN and xPCN in Fig. 1 c revealed the typical profile of graphitic carbon nitride, indicated that after doping PEI into the CN skeleton, the original conjugated system and functional groups of CN were well preserved [24]. Concretely, the typical peaks at 3000–3600 cm−1 were corresponded to the stretching vibration of O-H/N-H [36]. The characteristic peaks at 1200–1700 cm−1 and 810 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of heterocyclic units of aromatic CN and the bending vibration of s-triazine units, respectively [36]. XPS was employed to explore the chemical bonding states and specific surface composition of CN and 32.5PCN photocatalysts. The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 1 d presented that both photocatalysts were consisted of C and N elements, and a small peak of O element may come from the ineluctable adsorption of O2 or H2O [37]. In high-resolution N 1 s spectra (Fig. 1 e), the peaks with binding energy of 398.4, 400.2 and 404.2 eV were ascribed to sp2 hybridized aromatic nitrogen (CN–C), tertiary nitrogen (N–(C)3) and charging effects/N–N bonds/π-excitations/amino functional groups with hydrogen (N4) in graphitic carbon nitride materials, respectively [20,38,39]. In high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig. 1 f), apart from the two peaks around 284.8 (graphite carbon atoms C–C) and 288.1 eV (sp2-hybridized carbon N–CN in the framework of graphitic carbon nitride materials), the 32.5PCN included one more peak at 286.6 eV than CN, which corresponded to the C-NHx species, suggested that more -NHx groups were appeared on the surface of 32.5PCN owing to the doping of PEI [38,39]. The -NHx groups are beneficial to disperse in water, absorb protons and produce hydrogen [38–40]. The morphology of the photocatalysts were observed by the SEM and TEM. The SEM image of CN (Fig. 2 a) revealed a typical layered stack morphology with dense surface, while the morphology of 5PCN ( Fig. S1 a), 14PCN ( Fig. S1 b), 32.5PCN (Fig. 2 b), 50PCN ( Fig. S1 c) and 75PCN ( Fig. S1 d) displayed loose tremella-like lamellar structure (especially the xPCN with high PEI doping). Accordingly, the specific surface area increased with the increase of PEI doping (Table S1). In addition, the TEM images of CN (Fig. 2 c) and 32.5PCN (Fig. 2 d) also confirmed that the 32.5PCN showed thiner lamellar structure with few layers, while the CN was more dense. The loose tremella-like lamellar structure is very conducive to expose more catalytic active sites, improve light absorption and enhance molecular diffusion dynamics, thus improving the photocatalytic performance [3,41]. Combined with the above discussion, a possible formation process of tremella-like integrated CN photocatalyst via one-pot thermally induced copolymerization of urea and PEI is illustrated in Fig. 3 . As widely reported, urea was first decomposed into cyanic acid and isocyanic acid, then produced biuret and cyanuric acid. Under the action of NH3, the melamine was formed, which was further polymerized to form melem [42,43]. It is well known that the extension of melem generated CN frameworks via their side amino groups [42,44]. While the PEI is an amino-riched polymer, it may induce the extension of melem and extend conjugate structure of CN. Furthermore, the long-chain of PEI was decomposed at high temperature circumstance, and under the impact of gas [12], the stripped lamellar structure is formed, that is, the lamellar tremella CN. With the increase of PEI contents, the phenomenon became more evident and the specific surface area increased."
9,Photocatalytic performances,"3.2 Photocatalytic performances 3.2.1 Photocatalytic degradation of TC As an extensively used antibiotic, TC has been frequently involved in various fields and its residue has become a long-term problem [45,46]. The photocatalytic activity of CN and xPCN were surveyed by degrading TC in aqueous solution under visible light. As depicted in Fig. 4 a, the self-degradation of TC is not obvious and the adsorption abilities of TC for all photocatalysts in the dark were negligible. The degradation rate of TC by CN was 51.1% in 100 min, while the degradation rate of TC by 5PCN, 14PCN, 32.5PCN, 50PCN and 75PCN were 67.2%, 78.2%, 80%, 75.6% and 53.7% in the same time, indicated that doping an appropriate amount of PEI into CN can significantly improve the photocatalytic degradation effect of CN for TC. Furthermore, the plots of TC degradation obeyed the first-order kinetic equation (Fig. 4 b) [47], and the degradation rate constants (k) of CN, 5PCN, 14PCN, 32.5PCN, 50PCN and 75PCN are 0.00683, 0.01213, 0.01964, 0.02261, 0.01724 and 0.00838 min−1, respectively. It is worth noting that the maximum k value (32.5PCN) is 3.18 times of CN. 3.2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The enhanced photocatalytic performance was further confirmed by the photocatalytic hydrogen production over CN and xPCN. As revealed in Fig. 4 c and Fig. 4 d, when the PEI-doping contents increased from 5 to 32.5 mg, the H2 production performance of xPCN gradually increased, while further increase caused a decrease of H2 production. The 32.5PCN revealed the highest photocatalytic H2 production efficiency of 1223.44 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 2.46 times of CN under visible light. The results further confirmed that doping an appropriate amount of PEI into CN can improve photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of carbon nitride material."
10,Mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity 3.3.1 Light absorption properties and band structure The optical adsorption and band gap of CN and xPCN were explored by UV–Vis DRS. From Fig. 5 a, compared with CN, the synthesized xPCN displayed apparent red shift and significantly enhanced absorption in visible light region with increasing the contents of PEI, indicated that the addition of PEI can effectively improve the response ability of carbon nitride material to visible light. Meanwhile, as depicted in Fig. 5 a inset, the color of xPCN gradually deepened from light yellow (CN) to brownish brown (75PCN) and matched well with the change of optical absorption. Apparently, more photons were captured in the visible range for xPCN to trigger the photoreactions [48]. Moreover, the band gap was estimated by the Tauc formula αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2 [49], in which α represents the absorption coefficient, ν represents the optical frequency, Eg is the band gap, A is a constant, and the value of n depends on the transition characteristics of the semiconductor itself [50]. Different visible light absorbability results in different band gaps of photocatalysts. By drawing hν with (αhν)2, the band gap Eg of CN and xPCN were in the range of 2.72 eV-1.74 eV (Fig. 5 b), respectively. The Mott-Schottky test was adopted to explore the band position of photocatalysts. As presented in Fig. 5 c, the positive slopes of CN and 32.5PCN indicated that they were typical n-type semiconductors, and the flat band potentials (Ef) of CN and 32.5PCN were −0.92 and −1.02 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which can be converted to −0.72 and −0.82 V (vs. NHE) [12,24], respectively. As reported, the conduction band potentials (ECB) of most n-type semiconductors were about 0.1 V lower than the Ef [51,52], thus the ECB of CN and 32.5PCN were −0.82 and −0.92 V (vs. NHE), respectively. According to the empirical equation EVB = ECB + Eg and the Eg obtained from Taus plots [53], the valence band potentials (EVB) of CN and 32.5PCN can be calculated as 1.9 and 1.49 V, respectively. Based on the above discussion, schematic diagrams for the band structure of CN and 32.5PCN were depicted in Fig. 5 d. Compared with CN, the up shifted conduction band and obviously narrowed band gap of 32.5PCN were very conducive to the reduction of protons and the absorption of visible-light, thus enhancing the photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen production performance [54,55]. To deeply explore the mechanism of the charge transport in photocatalytic process [56]. Fig. 6 a showed the PL spectra of CN and xPCN. Notably, pure CN presented a strong emission peak around 470 nm, suggesting the high combination rate of the electrons and holes [25]. Contrarily, the xPCN photocatalysts exhibited significantly quenched photoluminescence intensity and the position of emission peak shifted to a longer wavelength, indicated that the doping of PEI can drastically inhibit the recombination of electrons-holes in CN, and the inhibition effect increased with the contents of PEI [57]. More intuitively, PL quenching was also confirmed by the photographs of CN and 32.5PCN powders and their suspended aqueous under UV-light (λ = 365 nm). As presented in Fig. 5 e, compared with CN, both powders and suspension of 32.5PCN exhibited distinctly weaker PL. 3.3.2 PCR and EIS The photoswitching characteristics, transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers were also surveyed by PCR and EIS measurements [58]. In Fig. 6 b, the PCR intensity of 32.5PCN was much higher than that of pure CN and other xPCN, strongly implied that the 32.5PCN possessed a more effective separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs [59,60]. Additionally, in Fig. 6 c, the electrochemical impedance radius of 32.5PCN was distinctly smaller than that of pure CN and other xPCN, indicated that 32.5PCN possessed lower interface charge transfer resistance and the higher charge transfer ability [61]. Evidently, these results indicated that doping an appropriate amount of PEI into CN can effectively promote the separation of photogenerated excitons and accelerate the transfer of photogenerated carriers, thus improving photocatalytic performance. In summary, it is consistent with reported in literature 12 [12], with the increase of PEI contents, the visible-light absorption and PL quenching ability of xPCN increased (This may be attributed to the increase of specific surface area), indicated that the doping of PEI can promote the absorption of visible-light and inhibit the recombination of electrons-holes in CN. It is worth noting that with the increase of PEI, the crystal structures of xPCN were destroyed to some extent. Meanwhile, the PCR and EIS of xPCN increase first and then decrease. That is, excessive doping PEI not only affect the crystal structures of xPCN, but also decrease the separation efficiency of excitons and transfer ability of carrier, thus decrease the photocatalytic hydrogen production and degradation efficiency. Based on the above factors, the 32.5PCN obtained the optimal photocatalytic activity. The 32.5PCN were further compared with similar or common photocatalytic materials reported in recent years for hydrogen production and degradation TC (Table S1) [48,62–66]. Apparently, the 32.5PCN exhibits higher hydrogen production performance and comparable degradation efficiency for TC. It is worth noting that this research produced hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and used less photocatalysts to degrade higher concentration of TC. 3.3.3 Evaluation of reactive species To further elucidate the mechanism of 32.5PCN on the degradation of TC under visible light, the free radical capture experiment was conducted to explore the active species. As presented in Fig. 6 d, compared with the system without quencher, the photocatalytic degradation of TC by 32.5PCN was inhibited by L-AA, IPA and EDTA-2Na, and the order of action was •O2 – > h+ > •OH. To further verify the role of •O2 – and •OH, electron spin resonance (ESR) tests were carried out by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-n-oxide (DMPO) as the capture agent. The results in Fig. 6 e and 6f revealed that the typical characteristic peaks of DMPO-•O2 – and DMPO-•OH were not observed under dark conditions, while appeared upon light irradiation. It is indicated that •O2 – and •OH were active substances in the process of TC degradation by 32.5PCN, which were consistent with the experimental results of free radical capture."
11,The reusability and stability evaluation,"3.4 The reusability and stability evaluation The reusability and stability are important indexes to evaluate the performance of photocatalyst. As depicted in Fig. 7 a, the degradation rate of TC over the 32.5PCN photocatalyst decreased slightly after four continuous photocatalytic degradation cycles, which may be caused by the loss of photocatalyst in the recovery processes. In addition, the XRD, photograph and FTIR of 32.5PCN before and after photocatalytic degradation of TC in Fig. 7 b and Fig. S2 showed that the crystal structure, color and functional groups of 32.5PCN has not obviously changed after four consecutive cyclic degradation experiments, which confirm the excellent reusability and stability of synthesized photocatalyst."
12,Conclusion,"Committed to solving energy crisis and environmental problems, PEI doped integrated CN with enhanced photocatalytic performances were developed for degradation and hydrogen production. The doping of PEI did not change the structure of graphite carbon nitride system, while exposed more active sites, widened the response range/ability to visible light, up-shifted conduction band, narrowed band gap and improved the separation/transfer ability of photogenerated carriers, thus generating improved degradation and hydrogen production performance. Moreover, benefiting from integrated carbon nitride structure, the optimal 32.5PCN photocatalyst displayed excellent stability. The research provided a new way to simple and low-cost enhance the photocatalytic performance of carbon nitride materials."
