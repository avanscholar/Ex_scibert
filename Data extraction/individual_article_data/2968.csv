0,Introduction,"The utilization of fossil fuels through combustion is the main driving force in the progress of industrialization. However, burning fossil fuels has caused a number of environmental problems such as air pollution, acid rain, deteriorated atmospheric greenhouse effect, global warming, and climate change. In contrast, hydrogen has been considered as a crucial candidate for the development of clean energy, and can be applied in industrial, residential, and transportation sectors (Evangelisti et al., 2017; Pudukudy et al., 2014). For instance, when hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells or burned in internal combustion engines, the prime by-product is water and air pollutant emissions are extremely slight. In general, hydrogen is produced from a variety of feedstocks such as fossil fuels, biomass, alcohols, and various hydrocarbons via thermochemical methods (Burmistrz et al., 2016; Chen and Lin, 2013). Currently, the steam reforming (SR) of methane or natural gas is the most important route to produce commercial hydrogen (Dufour et al., 2009; Palma et al., 2016). Compared to other thermochemical methods such as partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR), SR has higher theoretical H2 yield and energy efficiency (Haryanto et al., 2005). Moreover, no air, the common oxidizing agent used for POX and ATR, is consumed in SR. The hydrogen concentration in the product gas will be high, stemming from the absence of nitrogen. It should be mentioned that natural gas is not a renewable resource. Consequently, steam methane reforming (SMR) for hydrogen production is not an environmentally friendly process. In contrast, ethanol (C2H5OH) is a potential candidate for H2 production inasmuch as it is a renewable and available liquid source (Deluga et al., 2004). In fact, ethanol can be thought of as a H2 carrier in consequence of its easy transport. Ethanol is biodegradable and has low toxicity (Muroyama et al., 2010). It is miscible with water and easily reacts with water in SR to generate hydrogen-rich gas. Moreover, ethanol will not cause catalyst poisoning because of no sulfur contained (Fishtik et al., 2000). It is known that polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are one of the promising devices to practice hydrogen economy (Chandan et al., 2013). Though the hydrogen concentration in the product gas from ethanol steam reforming (ESR) is high, the concentrations of other gases such as CO, CO2, and CH4 may also exist. In particular, CO, present as an impurity in hydrogen, will cause surface poisoning on fuel cell electrodes and poor performance of catalysts (Chen and Jheng, 2007; Waszczuk et al., 2001). In this aspect, the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is a useful means to lower CO concentration and enhance H2 formation in a gas stream. Once the ESR is implemented, the WGSR can be subsequently carried out to diminish CO concentration to the level of 0.1–0.3% (Smith et al., 2010). In fact, not only the CO concentration is reduced from the WGSR, the efficiency of the fuel cells can also be intensified from the increase of hydrogen content. While the CO concentration in the stream from SMR or ESR is lowered through the WGSR, the CO2 concentration is raised (Chen et al., 2008b). Currently, CO2 capture followed by storage has been thought of as an effective countermeasure to decrease anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate global warming (Viebahn et al., 2015). In general, the higher the CO2 concentration in the flue gas, the better the CO2 capture performance and the smaller the capture reactor (Buhre et al., 2005). Accordingly, the WGSR is a promising process to simultaneously produce H2 and enrich CO2 from fossil fuels, biomass, and hydrocarbons. The resultant stream is conducive to the separation of H2 from CO2 via Pd-based membrane (Chen et al., 2016), thereby abating CO2 emissions. For example, the WGSR plays a pivotal role in the combination of coal gasification and pre-combustion CO2 capture in integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants for the development of clean coal technology (Carbo et al., 2009). The literature reviewed above suggests that the combination of ESR and WGSR can reach the requirements of sustainable source, H2 production, and CO2 enrichment at the same time. Besides, the easy transport of liquid ethanol provides flexible operation for prospective hydrogen economy. ESR or WGSR has been extensively studied in the past. To date, to the authors’ knowledge, only one study has been performed on the combination of ESR and WGSR (Batista et al., 2006); however, only one reaction temperature (400 °C) was considered. That is, the information from the integration of ESR and WGSR remains insufficient and the optimal operation has not been studied yet. For these reasons, the present study aims to explore the phenomena of H2 production and CO2 enrichment from a two-stage reaction where ESR followed by the WGSR is carried out. Meanwhile, the Taguchi method is employed to examine the influences of a number of operating parameters on the performance of the two-stage reaction. Furthermore, the optimal operation for maximizing the H2 yield from ethanol is evaluated. The obtained results are conducive to the development of clean H2 production and CO2 capture from the renewable feedstock of ethanol."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst characterization,"2.1 Catalyst characterization A variety of catalysts containing special or noble metals such as Ni/Al2O3−La2O3 (Carrera Cerritos et al., 2011), Co/ZrO2, Co/CeO2, (Song et al., 2010), Co/SiO2 (Batista et al., 2006), Pt/ZrO2 (Yamazaki et al., 2010), etc., have been used to trigger ESR. It is known that Ni supported on Al2O3 is a commercially available catalyst and has lower cost; hence a commercial Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (Clariant, FCR-4) was employed for ESR in this study. Meanwhile, a commercial catalyst of iron (Fe) supported on Cr2O3 (Sinchem Industry CO. Limited, B113-2) was adopted for the WGSR. The geometric shape of the Ni-based catalyst pellets was spherical (diameter = 5.25 mm), and the Fe-Cr-based catalyst pellets were cylindrical (diameter × length = 6.10 mm × 5.35 mm), as shown in Figs. 1 a and b, respectively. The scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol JSM-6500F) images of the Ni-based and Fe-Cr-based catalysts are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively, where the images were amplified by factors of 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000. The surface porous structures of the two catalysts can be clearly observed from the images. The figures also depict that the particles on the Ni-based catalyst are smaller than those on the Fe-Cr-based one. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Jeol JSM-6500F) spectrum of the Ni-based catalyst is displayed in Fig. 4 a where the peaks of Al, O, and Ni are obviously exhibited. Meanwhile, the peaks of Cr, O, and Fe are significantly observed in the EDS spectrum of the Fe-Cr-based catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4b. The mass and atomic percentages of O, Al, and Ni in the Ni-based catalyst, and O, Fe, Cr in the Fe-Cr-based catalyst are tabulated in Table 1 ."
3,Experimental setup and procedure,"2.2 Experimental setup and procedure The experimental system shown in Fig. 5 was used to carry out experiments for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide enrichment. The system consisted of a feeding unit, a reaction unit, a condenser, a gas analysis unit, and a liquid analysis unit. In the feeding unit, a mixture of ethanol and water was stored in a flask, and the flow rate of the feed liquid was controlled by a dosing/metering pump (KNF SIMDOS 02). The reaction unit was composed of an ESR reactor and a WGSR reactor in sequence. The internal diameter and length of the ESR reactor were 21 and 250 mm, respectively, and they were 39.8 and 360 mm for the WGSR reactor. Past studies (Shinoki et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2006) suggested that the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) for ESR was between 0.05 and 24 h−1. In this study, the values of LHSV corresponding to 2 and 4 cm3/min along with 70 g of the Ni-based catalyst were 2.14 and 4.28 h−1, respectively, which are typical for ESR experiments. Seeing that the volume of produced gas expanded significantly from the ESR, 450 g of the Fe-Cr-based catalyst was utilized to ascertain the sufficient reaction time for the WGSR. The temperatures of the two reactors were individually controlled by two temperature controllers. When the feed liquid flew into the first reactor, it was vaporized due to the high temperature environment. Then the ESR was triggered in the Ni-based catalyst bed. The produced gas subsequently flew into the second reactor in which the WGSR was excited in the Fe-Cr-based catalyst bed. After undergoing the two-stage reaction, the vapor in the effluent was preliminarily condensed in the condenser. The condensed liquid was collected and weighed by an electronic balance. The gas analysis unit comprised an automotive emission analyzer (Horiba, MEXA-584L), an online gas analyzer (Fisher-Rosemount, NGA 2000), and a wet gas meter (Shinagawa Corporation W-NK). The automotive emission analyzer was used to measure the CO concentration, while the gas analyzer was utilized to measure H2, CO2, and CH4 concentrations. The wet gas meter was employed to measure the wet gas flow rate. As for the liquid analysis unit, a portable refractometer (DGS C9W-SA0080) was applied to measure the ethanol concentration (vol %) in the condensed liquid so that the ethanol conversion in the reaction system could be calculated. Prior to performing experiments, the emission analyzer was calibrated by a standard gas, and the calibration of the gas analyzer was carried out using an internal calibrating gas. Pure water was used to carry out the zero point calibration of the refractometer. Meanwhile, a number of water-ethanol solutions with different ethanol concentrations were prepared to establish a calibration curve of the refractometer. Accordingly, it is believed the measured concentrations from these devices and/or instruments were precise and reliable. In each run, the experiment lasted for 4 h where the steady results were obtained."
4,Operating conditions and Taguchi approach,"2.3 Operating conditions and Taguchi approach In the experimental system, the performance of hydrogen production and carbon dioxide enrichment is subject to a number of operating parameters such as the feed liquid flow rate, water-to-carbon (H2O/C) molar ratio, ESR temperature, and WGSR temperature. Therefore, the four factors were taken into account. The Taguchi method is an optimization route which can be adopted to aid in experimental design and efficiently minimize the number of tests (Chen et al., 2013). Moreover, the Taguchi approach is able to identify the primary operating factors in affecting experiment performance (Chen et al., 2015a, 2017). These advantages make the Taguchi approach be able to drastically reduce the cost for seeking the optimal operation. In the experimental design, each factor has three levels. Levels for the feed liquid flow rate were 2, 3, and 4 cm3/min for appropriate LHSV, as described earlier. The stoichiometric H2O/C ratio for ESR is 1.5. On account of a two-stage reaction involved, three H2O/C ratios of 3, 4, and 5 were adopted to facilitate the second-stage WGSR. The ESR and WGSR were generally operated at the temperature range of 400–550 °C (Muroyama et al., 2010) and at around 350 °C (Haryanto et al., 2005), respectively; hence three temperature levels of 400, 450, and 500 °C for the ESR and 300, 350, and 400 °C for the WGSR were selected. The experimental design of the Taguchi method is based on a matrix where columns are assigned to factors and the rows list levels, as shown in Table 2 . Once the properties (i.e., levels) and parameters (i.e., factors) to be investigated are chosen, the next step is to define experimental runs. This is done by employing an orthogonal array which combines appropriate levels of all the factors. In this study, an L9(34) orthogonal array was used, as shown in Table 3 . A full factorial approach will include a total of 34 (=81) runs, but only nine designed runs (Table 3) are required in the Taguchi approach (Chen and Hung, 2013; Chou et al., 2009). By following the Taguchi method, the optimal set of the operating parameters for maximizing the H2 yield from ethanol could be obtained from the 9 runs. To reach this goal, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was introduced to analyze the quality characteristics of product or process parameters, and the criterion of the larger-the-better was adopted. This arises from the fact that a higher S/N ratio leads to a higher H2 yield. The S/N ratio in terms of the H2 yield was determined by the following equation (Chen et al., 2017; Chou et al., 2009). (1) S/N ratio = −10 log (1/y 2) y represents the measured H2 yield in the experiment. With the obtained S/N ratios in the 9 runs, the mean S/N ratio for a certain factor-level was calculated by averaging the S/N ratios. The optimal level for a certain factor is the one that had the largest mean S/N ratio value. The optimal combination was determined once all optimal levels for all factors were obtained."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Gas production and reaction performance,"3.1 Gas production and reaction performance Based on the level combination of the designed experiments in the orthogonal array shown in Table 3, the H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 concentrations in the product gas at the 9 runs are shown in Fig. 6 . Overall, the H2 concentration is in the range of 66.71–70.73 vol% (Fig. 6a) which accounts for the largest share in the product gas. Stoichiometrically, the ESR is expressed as (2) C 2 H 5 O H + 3 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 6 H 2 The preceding equation reveals that the theoretical H2 percentage in the product gas is 75% if all ethanol is converted and no other by-products, say, CO and CH4, are produced. The H2 concentrations at Runs 3, 5, and 9 are higher than 70% which is close to the theoretical result (i.e., 75%). This reflects the good performance of the reaction system at the three runs. In addition to Eq. (1), the ESR may also produce syngas, namely, H2 and CO, through the following step (3) C 2 H 5 O H + H 2 O → 2 C O + 4 H 2 This is the reason why CO is also detected in the product gas (Fig. 6b). In the studies of Comas et al. (2004) and Sun et al. (2005) regarding ESR using Ni-based catalysts, the values of CO and CO2 selectivity were in a comparable state at certain operating conditions. In Fig. 6b, the maximum CO concentration in the product gas is 3.69% which occurs at Run 7. This value is by far smaller than the H2 concentration (Fig. 6a), as a consequence of the WGSR which converts CO into CO2 in the second reactor (Fig. 5) through the following equation (4) C O + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 For this reason, it can be seen that the CO2 concentration (i.e., 18.99–23.44%) is much higher than the CO one (Fig. 6c). This indicates that carbon contained in ethanol can be effectively converted into CO2 in the two-stage reaction, thereby enriching CO2 in the product gas. This is conducive to CO2 capture from the product gas if CO2 storage is practiced. In addition to H2, CO2, and CO, CH4 is also detected in the effluent, and its concentration ranges from 1.52 to 6.07%. In industry, Ni-based catalysts are also common catalysts for methanation from syngas (Liu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012). The reactions are expressed as (Chen et al., 2015b) (5) C O + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + H 2 O (6) C O + 4 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + 2 H 2 O This is reason why CH4 is detected in the product gas as well. While the ESR proceeds, there are several reaction pathways that could also occur. They include ethanol dehydration and decomposition where ethylene (C2H4), acetaldehyde (C2H4O), and acetone (CH3COCH3) will form (Haryanto et al., 2005; Yamazaki et al., 2010). Ethanol may also react with water to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH). On account of inevitable generation of these by-products, the summation of the concentrations of the four gases in the 9 runs is smaller than 100%. The ethanol conversion and H2 yield of the 9 runs are displayed in Fig. 7 a and b, respectively. Fig. 7a depicts that ethanol is completely converted at Runs 2–5. The ethanol conversion in the other runs is incomplete, stemming from higher flow rate (4 cm3/min) and/or lower reforming temperature (400 °C). From the kinetic point of view, the residence time of the reactants in the catalyst beds is short if the flow rate is high, which disadvantages the chemical reactions (Ciambelli et al., 2010). Alternatively, the ESR pertains to endothermic reaction in nature. Heat provision for the reaction is insufficient if the reforming temperature is low so that reactants cannot react completely (González-Gil et al., 2016). The minimum ethanol conversion is 96.0% which takes place at Run 9. These results clearly reveal that, as a whole, the ethanol conversion in the reaction system is high. However, the high ethanol conversion does not always lead to a high H2 yield. For example, the ethanol conversion at Runs 2–5 is 100%; nevertheless, there is an obvious difference in the H2 yield between the four runs. The maximum H2 yield located at Run 3 is 4.21 mol/(mol C2H5OH) which is substantially greater than the results of the other three runs. This reflects that the appropriate combination of the levels of the factors plays a crucial role in maximizing the H2 yield."
7,Taguchi approach,"3.2 Taguchi approach As described earlier, the Taguchi method possesses the merits of identifying the sensitivity of factors and finding the optimal operation. To achieve this goal, the values of the S/N ratio of the 9 runs are plotted in Fig. 8 . Physically, the larger the S/N ratio, the better the system performance (Chen and Hung, 2013). Accordingly, the comparison of the S/N ratio among the 9 runs indicates that Run 3 renders the best result in H2 production. Run 3 corresponds to the combination of the feed liquid flow rate at 2 cm3/min, H2O/C ratio at 5, ESR temperature at 500 °C, and WGSR temperature at 400 °C (Table 3). This combination means that a lower feed liquid flow rate accompanied by higher H2O/C ratio, and ESR and WGSR temperatures provides a better performance. On the other hand, Run 1 with the four conditions of 2 cm3/min, 3, 400 °C, and 300 °C (Table 3) leads to the lowest H2 yield where the value is 1.85 mol/(mol C2H5OH). To further recognize the influences of the four factors on the H2 yield, the profiles of the mean S/N ratios of the factors are shown in Fig. 9 a. The profiles depict that the mean S/N ratio (or H2 yield) does not monotonically increase or decrease with rising the level value of the feed liquid flow rate (Factor A), H2O/C ratio (Factor B), or ESR temperature (Factor C). From kinetic or thermodynamic (Le Chatelier’s principle) point of view, a decrease in the feed liquid flow rate or the WGSR temperature facilitates H2 production; on the contrary, H2 formation favors a higher H2O/C ratio or ESR temperature. However, due to the coupling of the four factors on H2 production, the H2 production cannot be simply explained from the profiles in Fig. 9a. Nevertheless, the mean S/N ratio monotonically increases with increasing the WGSR temperature, clearly reflecting that the WGSR triggered by the Fe-Cr-based catalyst is kinetically governed rather than thermodynamically dominated. Similar phenomenon has been found in other studies (Chen et al., 2008a; Chen and Jheng, 2007). The effect of each factor is calculated from the maximum mean S/N ratio of the factor subtracted by the minimum one (Chen and Hung, 2013), and the effect values of the four factors are demonstrated in Fig. 9b. Physically, a larger effect value of a factor stands for its larger impact on the H2 yield. It is obvious that the role played by Factor B (the H2O/C ratio) on the H2 yield is markedly superior to the other three factors. It follows that, in the reaction system with the investigated ranges of the levels, the H2O/C ratio is a key parameter in determining the H2 yield. Fig. 9b also reveals that the influences of the four factors on H2 yield is ranked as Factor B > Factor C > Factor D > Factor A. Nevertheless, Factors A, C, and D are in a comparable state in that their effect values are close to each other."
8,Optimal operation,"3.3 Optimal operation From the profiles shown in Fig. 9a, the optimal operation for maximizing the H2 yield can be obtained by combining the levels of the four factors with maximum mean S/N ratios. Accordingly, from the viewpoint of the Taguchi approach, the optimal operation to maximize H2 yield is theoretically determined at the conditions of the feed liquid flow rate of 3 cm3/min (i.e., Factor A along with Level 2, A2), the H2O/C ratio of 5 (B3), the ESR temperature of 450 °C (C2), and the WGSR temperature of 400 °C (D3). The radar char of the optimal combination is shown in Fig. 10 . Based on this combination, an experiment was performed and Fig. 11 a presents the H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 concentrations in the product gas. The H2 concentration is 70.97% which is somewhat higher than that (=70.73%) at Run 9 (Fig. 6a), thereby verifying the optimal operation. Moreover, the CO2 concentration is 21.77% which is by far higher than the CO one (=0.81%), suggesting that the two-stage reaction at the optimal operation is able to effectively enrich CO2 concentration and abate CO formation. In addition, methanation is significantly lessened inasmuch as the CH4 concentration is as low as 1.59%. The values of ethanol conversion and H2 yield at the optimal operation are shown in Fig. 11b. It can be seen that all ethanol is converted and the H2 yield is 4.26 mol/(mol C2H5OH). This yield is higher than those of the 9 runs in Fig. 7b. In ESR, in addition to commonly employed Ni-based catalysts, some attempts have been performed by adding special or noble metals to improve the performance of the catalysts. Carrera Cerritos et al. (2011) prepared Ni/Al2O3−La2O3 catalysts with different weight percentages of La (5–12 wt%) by sol-gel process to produce H2 from ESR, and found that the catalyst containing 12 wt% of La rendered the highest H2 yield of around 4.2 mol/(mol C2H5OH), but also presented the highest deactivation. Song et al. (2010) prepared Co/ZrO2 and Co/CeO2 catalysts, and found that the highest H2 yields from ESR occurred at 550 °C where the values were 2.29 and 4.03 mol/(mol C2H5OH), respectively. Yamazaki et al. (2010) prepared Pt/ZrO2 catalysts with different weight percentages of Pt (1–5 wt%), and showed that the maximum H2 yield in ESR at 400 °C and H2O/C = 1.5 was 1.74 mol/(mol C2H5OH). Batista et al. (2006) prepared a Co/SiO2 catalyst, and ESR was carried out at 400 °C on a single catalytic bed reactor containing the catalyst alone or mixed with a Fe2O3 /Cr2O3 catalyst and on a double bed system formed by the Co/SiO2 and Fe2O3 /Cr2O3 separate layers. Their results suggested that all the catalytic systems had average ethanol conversion of 90%. Fig. 11b depicts that the H2 yield and ethanol conversion in the present study are higher than the values obtained in the aforementioned studies. This indicates that the two-stage reaction using common catalysts for ESR and WGSR along with the suggested optimal operation from the Taguchi analysis is able to effectively produce H2 when compared to performances using catalysts with special or noble metals."
9,Theoretical performance,"3.4 Theoretical performance To evaluate the performance of H2 production in the reaction system, the thermodynamic analysis is also carried out using the commercial software HSC Chemistry 7.0. Methanation pertains to exothermic reaction in nature. Thermodynamically, low reaction temperatures in the WGSR (≤400 °C) favor CH4 formation. It was found that the equilibrium CH4 concentration in the product gas was by far higher than those of other gases once methanation reaction was taken into account, implying that CH4 was the dominant gas in the effluent. This result substantially departed from the realistic results (Fig. 6). Consequently, the methanation reaction was neglected in the thermodynamic analysis. The predicted H2 yields and C2H5OH conversion of the 9 runs and the optimal operation are tabulated in Table 4 . The table reveals that all ethanol is consumed, that is, all the ethanol conversion is 100%, irrespective of which run is practiced. The predicted H2 yield is always higher than 5.74 mol/(mol C2H5OH). The maximum H2 yield is 5.96 mol/(mol C2H5OH), developing at Run 9, which has the highest H2O/C ratio and the lowest WGSR temperature. The profile of the H2 yield ratio of the measured result to the thermodynamic prediction is displayed in Fig. 12 . Unlike the thermodynamic analysis (Table 4), the H2 yield in the experiments depends on the operational combination (Fig. 7b) so that the ratio in Fig. 12 is sensitive to the 9 runs. The maximum ratio is 0.73 (=4.26/5.87), occurring at the optimal operation. It follows that up to 73% of thermodynamic H2 yield can be achieved from the two-stage reaction."
10,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production and carbon dioxide enrichment using ethanol, a sustainable source, as the feedstock through a two-stage reaction have been investigated experimentally and analyzed using the Taguchi method. In the two-stage reaction, the ESR and WGSR are integrated and a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and a Fe/Cr2O3 catalyst are employed to trigger the two chemical reactions, respectively. In the designed orthogonal array considering four operating factors and three levels, the analysis suggests that the H2O/C ratio has the greatest impact on H2 production, followed by the ESR temperature, the WGSR temperature, and the feed liquid flow rate, sequentially. On account of the coupling of the four factor in the reaction system, the profiles of mean S/N ratio in terms of the H2 yield cannot be simply explained from the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. The suggested optimal operation from the analysis leads to the highest H2 yield when compared to those in the designed orthogonal array, thereby verifying the Taguchi approach. The maximum H2 yield of 4.26 mol/(mol C2H5OH) accounts for around 73% of thermodynamic H2 yield which is higher than the performance of catalysts using special or noble metals in a single stage reaction. Meanwhile, the CO2 concentration in the product gas under the optimal operation is enriched to 21.77%, whereas the CO concentration is as low as 0.81%. Accordingly, it is concluded that the two-stage reaction in association with the Taguchi analysis can reach the requirements of high H2 production and low CO formation, and is conducive to subsequent CO2 capture as a consequence of no N2 involved."
