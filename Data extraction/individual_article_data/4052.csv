0,Introduction,"There has been substantial interest in the use of hydrogen (H2) as an additive to hydrocarbon fuels for improved performance, including extended flammability limits and reduced pollutant emissions through lean burning, due to the high reactivity [1–4]. Recently, in response to the concern over global warming, there is also increasing interest in the use of pure hydrogen as a clean fuel, in either combustion devices or fuel cells [5–8]. However, the use of hydrogen imposes considerable technological challenges, particularly those associated with storage, transport and the performance of internal combustion engines. The volume-based energy density of hydrogen is much lower than hydrocarbons because of the difficulty to be liquefied, though the mass-based energy density is high. Thus, it is practically difficult to store hydrogen in combustion devices and fuel cells. Also, the transport infrastructure such as pipelines has not been well established. Furthermore, hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines could also be susceptible to substantial nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emission as well as knock-limited operation. Ammonia (NH3) is easily storable with high hydrogen content (17.7% by weight): a saturated pressure of 8.8 atm at 21 °C [9]. Also, ammonia can be easily reformed to hydrogen at either low temperature with catalysts or high temperature without catalysts [9]. The reforming process eliminates the production of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and catalyst-poisoning gases in fuel cells such as carbon monoxide (CO), since ammonia does not contain carbon. Compared with conventional methanol or hydrocarbon reforming processes to produce hydrogen, the carbon-free reforming process is one of benefits of using ammonia. Thus, ammonia can be considered as a clean hydrogen carrier if it is transported, stored and on-site reformed to hydrogen. On the other hand, ammonia can be burned directly in internal combustion engines, avoiding the problems such as substantial NO x emission and knock-limited operation in the use of hydrogen. In practical use, however, due to low flame temperature and high ignition energy, it should be burned with additives or catalysts. Attractive as it is, the use of ammonia also imposes considerable technological challenges and public concerns, particularly those associated with toxicity, safety and the specific properties such as high reactivity with container materials and water and high thermal expansion [9]. Also, the incompatibility of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells in the presence of even trace levels of ammonia has been reported [9], which may cause a similar problem to catalyst-poisoning CO generation in the conventional methanol or hydrocarbon reforming processes to produce hydrogen and requires a very effective filtration system with high temperature operations. These technological and societal issues should be completely resolved. Since over the last hundred years ammonia has been commonly used as an industrial and agricultural chemical and hence, can be handled safely and recently some technological challenges have been overcome, e.g., development of container materials compatible with ammonia [9] and direct ammonia fuel cells [10], these issues are expected to be eventually resolved once ammonia is substantially considered as a fuel (or a hydrogen carrier). Ammonia is usually produced via the Haber–Bosch process with methane as a feedstock [9,11]. Recently, there has been interest in producing ammonia by gasification of coals, and in the future ammonia may be synthesized from sunshine, water and air [11]. The latter process eliminates the production of greenhouse gases such as CO2: thus, ultimately ammonia as a clean fuel can be produced through an eco-friendly process. Recently an alternative approach towards enabling hydrogen utilization and diminishing the associated storage, transport and emission problems by using ammonia has been suggested [9]. A conceptual diagram of the system to reform ammonia to hydrogen is given in Fig. 1 . Carbon-free ammonia is reformed to hydrogen for hydrogen-consumed devices. This reforming process is usually endothermic, hence requiring a heat source. The required heat is also obtained from ammonia burning. As aforementioned, however, due to low flame temperature and high ignition energy, it is not practical to burn ammonia alone. If hydrogen is added to ammonia/air mixtures, these problems can be resolved, though catalytic burning may be another option. The added hydrogen can be extracted from the reformed hydrogen. This scenario seems to be very likely, involving only water (H2O) vapor and nitrogen (N2) as the final products. This indicates that ammonia utilization as a clean fuel can be considered as an interim solution until developing a full-fledged hydrogen economy. There are limited database on ammonia burning and reforming, however, since ammonia has not been used as a fuel, though it has been widely used as fertilizers, refrigerants, catalysts and process chemicals more than a century [12–15]. Furthermore, combustion characteristics of hydrogen-added ammonia have not been much understood and reported. Thus, the fundamental combustion characteristics of hydrogen-added ammonia need to be investigated. It is widely recognized that flame/stretch interactions, due to preferential diffusion of various species and heat, can significantly affect the propagation velocities and structure of premixed flames [16–18], including strongly turbulent premixed flames typical of practical applications [19]. Motivated by these observations, several studies of flame/stretch interactions of laminar premixed flames involving fuel oxidation by conventional air or oxygen (O2)-diluents (such as N2, argon (Ar) and helium (He)) mixtures have been conducted [20–23]. In particular, the earlier studies of flame/stretch interactions of laminar premixed flames using outwardly propagating spherical flames provided a unique method to accurately measure the fundamental unstretched laminar burning velocities, and sensitivities of flame response to stretch and non-equidiffusion of both heat and mass (represented by the Markstein number) of premixed flames [21]. In view of the above considerations, in the present investigation we aim to study the potential of using ammonia as a clean fuel, particularly improving ammonia burning performance by adding hydrogen to ammonia/air mixtures, with the following specific objectives. The first is to accurately measure and predict the laminar burning velocities of hydrogen/ammonia/air flames at normal temperature and pressure (NTP) using outwardly propagating spherical flames in order to provide the fundamental combustion database of ammonia as a fuel and quantify the extent of burning rate enhancement due to hydrogen addition. The second is to measure and predict the Markstein numbers, which represent flame response to stretch and non-equidiffusion of various species and heat, in order to provide the database of another fundamental combustion parameter. We shall also examine the effects of hydrogen substitution on the flame structure, including distributions of temperature and species concentrations, and the NO x and nitrous oxide (N2O) formation. The study will be conducted for a wide range of global fuel-equivalence ratios, flame stretch rates (represented by the Karlovitz number) and the extent of hydrogen substitution. The present discussion begins with descriptions of experimental and computational methods. Results are then considered, treating flame evolution and stability, burning velocity/stretch interactions, unstretched laminar burning velocities, Markstein numbers and flame structure, in turn."
1,Experimental and computational methods,"The outwardly propagating spherical flame was adopted as the model flame for the present investigation. Fundamentally, the flame is relatively easy to generate and its global configuration and dynamics are also well defined. Practically, it is the phenomenon that is most relevant to combustion in the spark ignition engines and accidental explosions [22]. Experimental methods are similar to past work and will be described only briefly, see [20,21] for more details. The experiments were conducted in a spherical windowed chamber having an inside diameter of 312 mm. The reactant mixture was prepared in the chamber by adding gases at appropriate partial pressures to reach the desired initial pressure. The gases were allowed to mix each other prior to ignition (10 min). The combustible mixture was spark-ignited at the center of the chamber using minimum spark ignition energies to control ignition disturbances. The flame propagation sequence was imaged with shadowgraphy and recorded using high-speed digital camera, up to 8000 frames/s. Once combustion was complete, the chamber was vented and then flushed with air to remove condensed water vapor and to cool the system to the allowable initial temperature range of the experiments (298±3K). Present measurements were limited to flames having diameters larger than 10 mm to avoid ignition disturbances and smaller than 60 mm to limit pressure increases during the measuring period to values less than 1.0% of the initial pressure. No results were considered where the flame surface was distorted or wrinkled due to effects of buoyancy or flame instability. Similar to earlier work [20,21], measurements were limited to the ratio of flame thickness to radius δ D /r < 2% (δ D ≡ Du /SL where Du and SL are the mass diffusivity of the unburned gas and the laminar burning velocity, respectively) so that effects of curvature and transient phenomena associated with large flame thicknesses were small. Finally, radiative heat losses were small and hence, ignored similar to past work. For these conditions, the local (stretched) laminar burning velocity and flame stretch rate are given as follows [24]: (1) S L = ( ρ b / ρ u ) ⅆ r / ⅆ t , K = ( 2 / r ) ⅆ r / ⅆ t where r, t and ρ b /ρ u are the flame radius, time and the density ratio of burned to unburned gases, respectively. The density ratio needed to find SL from Eq. (1) was computed assuming adiabatic constant-pressure combustion with the same concentrations of elements in the unburned and burned gases. These calculations were carried out using the adiabatic equilibrium algorithm of McBride and Gordon [25]. The experimental results reduced via Eq. (1) were analyzed to find flame/stretch interactions. At the aforementioned thin-flame limit conditions, the relationship between laminar burning velocity and flame stretch rate can be conveniently represented by combining an early proposal of Markstein [16] and the “local conditions” hypothesis of Kwon et al. [26], to yield: (2) S L ∞ / S L = 1 + M a K a where SL ∞ is the unstretched downstream laminar burning velocity, Ma is the Markstein number (representing the sensitivity of flame response to stretch) and Ka is the Karlovitz number (the normalized flame stretch). The Karlovitz number is defined as K D u / S L 2 where Du is the binary mass diffusivity of ammonia into the diluent (N2). The small stretch limit is also of interest, to connect present results at finite levels of stretch to classical asymptotic theories of laminar premixed flame propagation, as follows [21]: (3) S L / S L ∞ = 1 − M a ∞ K a ∞ , K a ∞ ≪ 1 Fortuitously, both existing measurements and numerical simulations at normal temperature and normal to moderately elevated pressures yield a linear correlation between S L ∞ / S L and Ka, for values of Ka not too near quenching conditions, which implies constant Markstein numbers for each reactant condition [19–21]. In view of the complexity of laminar premixed flames a general proof of this constant Markstein number property is unlikely, however, once established for given conditions this behavior provides a very concise and helpful way of summarizing preferential-diffusion/stretch interactions. Experiments were conducted on ammonia/air mixtures with hydrogen addition. The composition of the mixture was defined by its global fuel-equivalence ratio ϕ and the mole fraction of the hydrogen in the fuel gas, x h = X H 2 / ( X NH 3 + X H 2 ) where X H 2 and X NH 3 are the mole fractions of hydrogen and ammonia, respectively. Experiments were carried out for ϕ = 0.60–1.67 and xh = 0.0–0.5 and at a mixture temperature of 298 ± 3 K and atmospheric pressure (NTP). The final results were obtained by averaging measurements of 4–6 tests at each condition. Experimental uncertainties (95% confidence) are as follows: SL ∞ less than 10% and |Ma| less than 25% for |Ma| > 1 and less than 25%/|Ma| for |Ma| < 1. The outwardly propagating spherical laminar premixed flames were simulated using the unsteady one-dimensional laminar flame computer code COSILAB [27], developed by Rogg [28]. This algorithm allows for mixture-averaged multicomponent diffusion, thermal diffusion, variable thermochemical properties, and variable transport properties. The CHEMKIN package [29–31] was used as a preprocessor to find the thermochemical and transport properties for COSILAB. Prior to computing flame properties, all these properties were checked against original sources. In order to get the final form of governing equations for outwardly propagating spherical laminar premixed flames, the following assumptions were made: symmetric flows and hence, a one-dimensional description, no body forces, zero bulk viscosity, no Dufour effect, no viscous dissipation, ideal-gas behavior of the mixture, a constant pressure and no radiation heat losses. The initial conditions are the known initial composition and temperature of the reactant mixture in the whole computational domain. The ignition of the reactant mixture is simulated by a hot spot-like temperature profile as an initial condition. Once the reactant mixture is ignited and the flame starts to propagate, the zero-gradient boundary condition is maintained at each end of the computational domain. The flame position was taken at the point where gas temperatures were the average of the hot and cold boundaries. Due to stringent flame thickness limitations, however, the results were not affected significantly by the criterion used to define the flame position. The governing equations were discretized using finite-difference approximations. The numerical algorithm employs self-adaptive gridding to deal with regions where property gradients are large, with the present results based on an Euler extrapolation method. The computational grid in space and time was varied to ensure numerical accuracy within 1%, estimated by Richardson extrapolation of SL . All the calculations were carried out with the detailed ammonia oxidation mechanisms of Miller and Bowman [32] and Lindstedt et al. [33], involving 19 species and 73 reversible reactions and 19 species and 95 reversible reactions (not counting the range of third body collision efficiencies), respectively. The backward rates for all the mechanisms were found from chemical equilibrium requirements using the CHEMKIN package [30]. The numerical simulations were analyzed similar to the measurements: flame propagation was allowed to proceed sufficiently far so that effects of initial conditions were small and other limitations used to control experimental uncertainties, e.g., δ D /r < 2%, were also applied to the predictions. Separate calculations were completed for unstretched (plane) flames using the steady one-dimensional laminar premixed flame code PREMIX, due to Kee and coworkers [34]. This code was used to predict structure of unstretched flames and to obtain some properties of unstretched flames. In order to get the final form of governing equations for freely propagating planar flames, assumptions similar to COSILAB code were made: no body forces, zero bulk viscosity, no Dufour effect, no viscous dissipation, ideal-gas behavior of the mixture, a constant pressure and no radiation heat losses. The boundary conditions used are the known composition and temperature of the reactant mixture and the zero-gradient condition of species and temperature profiles for completely burned combustion products. The governing equations were discretized using finite-difference approximations, which were solved by the modified damped Newton's method. Other properties of these calculations, as well as levels of numerical accuracy, were the same as those using the COSILAB algorithm."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Flame evolution and stability,"3.1 Flame evolution and stability Three kinds of flame surface instabilities were observed during the present investigation: preferential-diffusion instability (when Ma <0), hydrodynamic instability and buoyant instability [21]. The presence of preferential-diffusion instability could be identified by irregular (chaotic) distortions of the flame surface relatively early in the flame propagation process. Preferential-diffusion instability was invariably observed when Markstein numbers were negative; fortunately, flame surfaces remained smooth at small radii even for unstable conditions so that laminar burning velocities could be measured for a time for these conditions. Hydrodynamic instability could be identified by the development of a somewhat regular cellular disturbance pattern on the flame surface; fortunately, these instabilities generally were observed for flame diameters greater than 60 mm so that they did not affect present measurements. A typical image of the presence of preferential-diffusion instability (and probably hydrodynamic instability) is provided in Fig. 2 a. Finally, buoyant instability was readily detected by distortion of the flame surface from a spherical shape, as well as by upward motion of the centroid of the flame image (Fig. 2b). As noted earlier, no measurements were made when any of these instabilities were observed."
4,Burning velocity/stretch interactions,"3.2 Burning velocity/stretch interactions Results for finite flame radii involve finite values of flame stretch so that the laminar burning velocity at the largest r observed, S L ∞ ′ , still differs from the fundamental unstretched laminar burning velocity of a plane flame, SL ∞. Thus, values of SL ∞ were found from Eq. (2) by plotting S L ∞ ′ / S L as a function of Ka. This yielded linear plots so that extrapolation to Ka = 0 gave S L ∞ ′ / S L ∞ and thus SL ∞. Then given SL ∞, plots of SL ∞/SL as a function of Ka could be constructed for a given reactant mixture and pressure, as suggested by Eq. (2). Typical plots of this type are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 for H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP. Only some typical test conditions are illustrated in these figures; results at all the other test conditions are similar. Results of both measurements and predictions illustrated respectively in Figs. 3 and 4 exhibit the linear relationship between SL ∞/SL and Ka that was exploited to find SL ∞ well within experimental uncertainties; similar behavior was observed during earlier work for hydrocarbon-, alcohol- and hydrogen-fueled laminar premixed flames [19–21,23]. Thus, the slope of each plot, which is equal to the Markstein number according to Eq. (2), is independent of Ka over the range of the measurements on these figures. Similar behavior was observed over the entire test range, which involves Ka <0.8; however, quenching effects as extinction conditions are approached (where Ka would be on the order of unity) would probably yield a more complex response to stretch [18]. Effects of flame stretch on SL were significant, e.g., over the entire test range, SL ∞/SL varied in the range 0.4–2.5 for Ka <0.8. The predictions illustrated in Fig. 4 were based on the chemical reaction mechanism of Miller and Bowman [32] but findings using the mechanism of Lindstedt et al. [33] were qualitatively similar (and will be quantified when measured and predicted SL ∞ and Ma are discussed in sections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively). The results of the numerical simulations are seen to be qualitatively similar to the measurements, supporting both a linear variation of SL ∞/SL with increasing Ka to yield constant Markstein numbers for each flame condition over the present test range and similar values of ϕ and xh for unstable (Ma <0) and stable (Ma >0) preferential-diffusion behavior. However, the properties of preferential-diffusion/stretch interactions are seen most concisely from measured and predicted Markstein numbers, which are considered in Section 3.4. Finally, it should be noted that predictions could be conducted for more test conditions than the measurements, e.g., xh = 0.1 for ϕ = 0.80, xh = 0.0 for ϕ = 1.00 and xh = 0.1 for ϕ = 1.25. Since effects of buoyancy were ignored for predictions, the presence of buoyant instability was avoided, extending the limits of flame-propagating test conditions."
5,Unstretched laminar burning velocities,"3.3 Unstretched laminar burning velocities Measurements and predictions of SL ∞ as a function of the mole fraction of the hydrogen in the fuel gas and fuel-equivalence ratio for H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP are plotted in Fig. 5 . Measurements include the results of Ronney [12], Pfahl et al. [13], Jabbour and Clodic [14] and Takizawa et al. [15] for pure NH3/air flames at NTP and the present investigation for H2-added NH3/air flames. The results of Ronney [12] were found using propagating spherical laminar premixed flames in a closed chamber under microgravity condition but with no consideration of stretch effects. Pfahl et al. [13] also measured laminar burning velocities for pure NH3/air flames at NTP, using propagating spherical laminar premixed flames in a closed chamber but with no consideration of stretch effects. The results of Jabbour and Clodic [14] were found using the vertical tube method at NTP but with no consideration of stretch effects. Takizawa et al. [15] measured laminar burning velocities for pure NH3/air flames at NTP, using propagating spherical laminar premixed flames in a closed chamber but again with no consideration of stretch effects. Considering that in the present investigation only buoyant flames were observed for most pure and moderately H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP and that all the earlier measurements for pure NH3/air flames did not consider stretch effects, it is doubtful if buoyancy-unaffected, unstretched laminar burning velocities could be accurately measured. Predictions shown in Fig. 5 include the results based on the reaction mechanisms of Miller and Bowman [32] and Lindstedt et al. [33] found by extrapolating results for simulations of outwardly-propagating spherical flames similar to the measurements. As aforementioned in Section 3.2, predictions could be conducted for more test conditions than the measurements, due to the ignorance of buoyancy effects. It is observed that the earlier measurements for a stoichiometric pure NH3/air flame are 20–35% smaller than the present predictions, while the present measurements for stoichiometric H2-added NH3/air flames are 10–15% smaller than the present predictions. The larger difference between the earlier measurements and the present predictions for the stoichiometric pure NH3/air flame can be explained as follows. The linear relationship between SL ∞/SL and Ka which was exploited to find SL ∞ shows a positive slope for the stoichiometric pure NH3/air flame (Fig. 4) but stretch effects were not considered for the earlier measurements which include finite levels of stretch rates. Thus, the measured, stretched laminar burning velocities are substantially smaller than the predicted, unstretched laminar burning velocities as shown in Fig. 5. Among the earlier measurements, the results of Ronney [12] are the closest to the present predictions: this better agreement was again expected since his measurement was conducted under microgravity condition, though stretch effects were not considered. On the other hand, both the measurements and predictions for the stoichiometric H2-added NH3/air flames considered stretch effects. Thus, the difference between the present measurements and predictions has been caused just by the used chemical reaction mechanisms and assumptions and the numerical errors. Finally, the present measurements and predictions of SL ∞ for H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP show good agreement for moderately H2-added mixtures (up to xh = 0.3), while the discrepancy is large for highly H2-added mixtures (xh = 0.5). In particular, the laminar burning velocity of a ϕ = 0.6 and xh = 0.5 flame using the mechanism of Lindstedt et al. [33] is significantly overestimated. Therefore, it should be careful to use the chemical reaction mechanism of Lindstedt et al. [33] tailored for pure NH3 oxidation to predict highly H2-added, fuel-lean NH3/air flames, though the reason for this large difference is unknown. In general, agreement to the present extent is considered to be satisfactory in the determination and prediction of laminar burning velocities if the chemical reaction mechanism of Miller and Bowman [32] is used. All the measurements and predictions for H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP show significant increase of SL ∞ with hydrogen substitution. In particular, increase of SL ∞ for the fuel-rich flames is more substantial than fuel-lean and stoichiometric flames. For example, the xh = 0.5 H2-added NH3/air flames of ϕ = 0.80 and 1.00, respectively, exhibit about 99% and 84% increase from the xh = 0.3 flames, while the xh = 0.5 flame of ϕ = 1.25 shows an increase of about 115%. This difference can be explained from the SL ∞ profiles of the pure NH3/air flames in Fig. 6 and the pure H2/air flames in Fig. 7 . Specially, while the maximum SL ∞ for the NH3/air flames occur around ϕ = 1.1, for the H2/air flames it occurs around ϕ = 1.8 as a result of the high diffusivity of hydrogen. Consequently, the difference between the ammonia and hydrogen flames is larger for fuel-rich conditions, particularly around ϕ = 1.8."
6,Markstein numbers,"3.4 Markstein numbers Markstein numbers quantify the sensitivities of the flame response to stretch. Together with unstretched laminar burning velocities, they are the two most important global properties of a laminar flame subjected to aerodynamic stretching [21]. As discussed earlier, Markstein numbers are independent of Karlovitz numbers for present conditions. Measured and predicted values of Markstein numbers for H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP are plotted as a function of the mole fraction of the hydrogen in the fuel gas and fuel-equivalence ratio in Fig. 8 . As aforementioned in Section 3.2, predictions could be conducted for more test conditions than the measurements, due to the ignorance of buoyancy effects. In general, the absolute values of Ma are somewhat underestimated; but the measured tendency is well predicted computationally. Similar to the predictions of SL ∞ in Section 3.2, the predicted Ma of a ϕ = 0.6 and xh = 0.5 flame using the mechanism of Lindstedt et al. [33] shows a significant disagreement with the other prediction and measurement. The general characteristics of unstable behavior (Ma <0) at fuel-lean conditions and stable behavior (Ma >0) at fuel-rich conditions are consistent with conventional explanations of flame stability based on preferential diffusion of the deficient reactant, see [21] and references cited therein. Behavior at intermediate conditions (around ϕ = 1.0 where Ma = 0) is more complex and, as discussed in [21], involves preferential diffusion of both heat and mass. In contrast to the consistent increase in SL ∞ with hydrogen substitution, the dependency of Ma on the nature and extent of substitution varies substantially. Specifically, for fuel-rich conditions, all hydrogen-substituted flames show that Ma is positive and increases with increasing xh , implying more stabilized flames with hydrogen substitution. This observation is reasonable because rich ammonia flames are preferential-diffusionally stable, while the substitution with moderate amounts of hydrogen will either further stabilize it or assert minimal destabilizing effect as in the case of ammonia. For fuel-lean conditions, all hydrogen-substituted flames show that Ma is negative and decreases with increasing xh , implying more unstable flames with hydrogen substitution. This observation is consistent with the above discussion for fuel-rich conditions. For stoichiometric conditions, however, flames show that Ma changes from positive to negative with increasing hydrogen substitution, implying that the flames become more unstable. The generally enhanced flame instability implies that the stabilizing effect of hydrogen addition (through approaching fuel-rich conditions) is overweighed by the destabilizing effect caused by the correspondingly reduced ammonia concentration which tends to render the flame to be more unstable. This opposite trend is somewhat expected from the different responses of Ma with ϕ between the pure hydrogen/air and pure ammonia/air flames: almost linear increase with increasing ϕ for the latter but rapid increase across moderately fuel-lean to stoichiometric concentrations and then a plateau profile over fuel-rich conditions for the former [21]. The response of Ma with ϕ for the pure ammonia/air flames is similar to that for the pure hydrocarbon/air flames showing almost linear increase or decrease with increasing ϕ [20]. Consequently, the destabilizing effect due to the reduced ammonia concentration dominates the flame response for this stoichiometric mixture. Finally, it is encouraging that the numerical simulations based on detailed chemical mechanisms can reproduce these trends, even though Markstein numbers were not used during past efforts to optimize the chemical kinetic parameters used in these mechanisms."
7,Flame structure,"3.5 Flame structure As discussed earlier, measurements and predictions (particularly, based on the detailed reaction mechanism of Miller and Bowman [32]) of SL ∞ and Ma are in reasonably good agreement over the present test range; therefore, the predictions were exploited to seek improved understanding about flame-structure/stretch interactions and the effect of hydrogen addition on flame structure. Results of these types for H2-added NH3/air flames at NTP are discussed in the following based on the Miller and Bowman [32] reaction mechanism. Corresponding results based on the mechanism of Lindstedt et al. [33] were similar, except for highly H2-added, fuel-lean NH3/air flames. The approach involved numerical simulations of outwardly-propagating spherical flames for stoichiometric (ϕ = 1.0) and unstable (ϕ = 0.6) preferential-diffusion conditions. The effect of hydrogen addition on flame structure was observed by comparing results for a high level of H2-substitution (xh = 0.5) with corresponding predictions for a pure stoichiometric NH3/air flame (xh = 0). Flame-structure/stretch interactions were observed by comparing results for a moderate level of stretch (Ka = 0.11) with corresponding predictions for an unstretched (plane) unstable (ϕ = 0.6) H2/NH3/air flame (Ka = 0). Typical predicted structures of pure and H2-added laminar premixed NH3/air flames (ϕ = 1.0) at NTP are illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. Results illustrated in the figures include distributions of temperature and species mole fractions as a function of distance though the flame. It should be noted that the origins of the length scales for both pure and H2-added flames in these figures are arbitrary and they do not correspond to the central ignition point. The results show that maximum concentrations of the radicals HO2, H2O2 and NO2 are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than those of H, OH and NO; therefore, the latter tend to dominate reactive effects in the present flames. Considering the results for the stoichiometric flames in Figs. 9 and 10, hydrogen substitution causes flame temperatures to increase. This occurs because the higher-reactive hydrogen compared to ammonia causes the flame to become stronger (note the increased concentrations of water vapor at the hot boundary of the H2-added flame compared to the pure ammonia flame); this causes a corresponding increase of the flame temperature of the H2-added flame compared to the pure ammonia flame. The increased temperature (and possibly increased concentrations of light radicals such as hydrogen atom and hydroxyl radical) causes radical concentrations, particularly the major radicals H, OH, O and NO, in the reaction zone of the H2-added flame to increase compared to the pure ammonia flame (e.g., the maximum mole fraction of H in the H2-added and pure ammonia flames are roughly 0.0103 and 0.0013, respectively), increasing reaction rates and thus laminar burning velocities for the H2-added flame. However, it should be noted that the maximum mole fractions of NO and NO2 also increase with hydrogen substitution. Thus, hydrogen substitution is expected to make the NO x emission performance worse. Also, nitrous oxide (N2O) which is one of strong greenhouse gases is expected to increase with hydrogen substitution, though its distribution is not included in Figs. 9 and 10. Fig. 11 compares the maximum mole fractions of NO x and N2O as a function of xh for various fuel-equivalence ratios (ϕ = 0.60, 1.00 and 1.67). As expected, hydrogen substitution enhances NO x and N2O formation for all mixtures. At fuel-rich conditions, however, the amount of NO x and N2O emissions and the extent of the increase with the hydrogen substitution are much lower than those under fuel-lean conditions. This observation along with the earlier observation that the relative amount of increase in SL ∞ with hydrogen substitution is more substantial for fuel-rich conditions supports the potential of hydrogen as an additive for improving the burning performance with low NO x and N2O emissions in fuel-rich ammonia/air flames and hence the potential of using ammonia as a clean fuel. Typical predicted structures of unstretched and stretched laminar premixed H2-added (xh = 0.5) NH3/air flames at NTP for fuel-lean (preferential-diffusionally unstable) conditions are illustrated in Figs. 12 and 13 , respectively. Similar to the earlier results for pure and H2-added, stoichiometric NH3/air flames, maximum concentrations of the radicals HO2, H2O2 and NO2 are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than those of H, OH and NO; therefore, the latter tend to dominate reactive effects in the present flames. Finite levels of stretch cause flame temperatures to increase. This occurs because the faster-diffusing ammonia (and hydrogen) compared to oxygen causes the flame to become more nearly stoichiometric (note the reduced concentrations of oxygen and increased concentrations of water vapor at the hot boundary of the stretched flame compared to the unstretched flame); this causes a corresponding increase of the flame temperature of the stretched flame compared to the unstretched flame. The increased temperature (and possibly increased concentrations of light radicals such as hydrogen atom and hydroxyl radical) causes radical concentrations, particularly the major radicals H, OH, O and NO, in the reaction zone of the stretched flame to increase compared to the unstretched flame (e.g., the maximum mole fraction of H in the stretched and unstretched flames are roughly 0.0019 and 0.0005, respectively), increasing reaction rates and thus laminar burning velocities for the stretched flame. Although the effect of stretch on flame structure for fuel-rich (preferential-diffusionally stable) conditions is not provided, it is just opposite to the behavior just discussed for unstable conditions, similar to the earlier work [21]."
8,Conclusions,"The potential of hydrogen as an additive for improving the burning performance with reasonable nitrogen oxide and nitrous oxide emissions in ammonia/air flames and hence the potential of using ammonia as a clean fuel were studied experimentally and computationally. The experiments involved outwardly-propagating spherical laminar premixed flames, while the computations involved numerical simulations of the same flame configuration considering the detailed chemical reaction mechanisms of Miller and Bowman [32] and Lindstedt et al. [33]. The test conditions included fuel-equivalence ratios of 0.60–1.67, the mole fraction of the hydrogen in the fuel gas of 0.0–0.5 and Karlovitz numbers of 0–0.8, at normal temperature and pressure. The major conclusions of the study are as follows: 1. Effects of flame/stretch interactions for both measurements and predictions could be correlated based on the local conditions hypothesis according to SL ∞/SL = 1 + MaKa to obtain a linear relationship between SL ∞/SL and Ka, yielding constant Markstein numbers for given reactant conditions. 2. Effects of flame stretch on laminar burning velocities were substantial, yielding values of SL ∞/SL in the range 0.4–2.5; corresponding Markstein numbers were in the range −4.5 to 3.0. 3. Predicted and measured unstretched laminar burning velocities and Markstein numbers were generally in good agreement using the contemporary N/H/O chemical reaction mechanisms [32,33]. Nevertheless, discrepancies among the predictions and measurements at some test conditions, e.g., fuel-lean conditions with large hydrogen concentrations, merit additional consideration. 4. The substantial increase of laminar burning velocities with hydrogen substitution, particularly under fuel-rich conditions, is observed due to the increased amount of hydrogen atom. 5. Predicted flame structures show that the hydrogen substitution enhances nitrogen oxide (NO x ) and nitrous oxide (N2O) formation; at fuel-rich conditions, however, the amount of NO x and N2O emissions and the extent of the increase with the hydrogen substitution are much lower than those under fuel-lean conditions. 6. These observations support the potential of hydrogen as an additive for improving the burning performance with low NO x and N2O emissions in fuel-rich ammonia/air flames and hence the potential of using ammonia as a clean fuel. 7. Increasing the amount of substituted hydrogen tends to enhance flame sensitivity to stretch."
