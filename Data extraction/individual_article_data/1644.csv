0,Introduction,"Energy needs of chemical industry and society entirely depend on fossil fuels, which procures 90% of our requirements [1]. Besides, its key application in the automobile sector and machinery energy resources, fossil assets also contribute in synthesis of industrial fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals solvents. The energy required in the production of synthetic goods for domestic or industrial use make us more reliant on fossil fuels and non-renewable resources [2]. However, the accessibility of fossil reserves increases energy ambiguity along with rising oil prices and negative environmental aspects like excessive green house gases CO2, CO and other toxic emissions [3]. In order to minimize this rising energy crisis, researchers have projected that second generation cellulosic fuels are the ecological energy source to accomplish both energy replacement and net zero carbon discharges. Biomass is the only renewable reserve expected to be 1.7–2.0 × 1011 tons per year, from the natural sources globally [4], that can be processed to liquid hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals [5,6]. With prospect, over the past few decades, bio-refinery concept of lignocellulose feedstock is fascinating throughout the world [7]. The potential biomass affords the most easily executed and low cost solution for viable transport fuels and the only non-petroleum means to organic molecules for the production of industrially important intermediates, chemicals and polymers, thus exploiting biomass valorisation [8,9]. To be really ecological, biomass must be originated from feedstocks like non-edible biomass components, such as lignocellulose, cellulose, chitin etc. which do not compete with cultivated land use for food production, or and prevent deforestation to protect the environment. Lignocellulosic biomass act as a raw material for manufacturing of second generation biofuel and other compounds, since it is an ample, economical and readily available in nature [10]. Recent applications in the catalysis field have established favourable methods for exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass into various value added chemicals [11,12]. Among a widespread chemicals obtained from lignocellulosic biomass, furfural and furfuryl alcohol have been accepted as one of the most attractive platform molecules [13,14] since it can be used as valuable intermediate for synthesis of levulinic acid, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, GVL, pentane diols, as well as other value-added chemicals [15–17]. One of the widespread and sustainable approaches to lignocellulosic-fractionating technologies established to date comprises the acidic hydrolysis of polysaccharides to their monomeric constituents, which are then in turn transformed to 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (1) and furfural (2). Fig. 1 . Shows the furfuryl alcohol has extensive applications for production alkyl furfuryl ether as crucial biofuel constituents and in perfumes [18–21]. There are two promising ways to produce alkyl furfuryl ether from biomass derived furfural; either the hydrogenation using formic acid/using molecular hydrogen or the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) using isopropyl alcohol. The hydrogenation reaction using formic acid is more preferred over homogeneous/heterogeneous noble metal catalysts, which allow formation of furfuryl alcohol and furfuryl alkyl ethers subsequently by reaction with alcohols with significant yields. Considering the potential of furfuryl ethers as drop-in fuel alternatives, the development of novel protocol is greatly desirable [22,23]. Zhang et al. reported conversion of furfuryl alcohol to alkyl levulinate via ether formation using environment friendly methylimidazolebutylsulfate phosphotungstate catalyst at 110 °C with appreciable yield. Subsequently other method has been developed for the direct transformation of fructose into 5-(ethoxymethyl)furfural catalyzed by an organic − inorganic hybrid solid catalyst [24]. Lewis et al. indicated coupled transfer hydrogenation and etherification of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural with primary and secondary alcohols into 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans, without the use of external hydrogen sources or precious metals using Lewis acid Zeolites [25]. Furfural is a biomass-derived platform compound, with a yearly manufacturing demand of more than 2,00,000 tonnes. This resourceful intermediate found applications in several fields, such as agrochemical, oil refining and pharmaceutical industries and for the production of a variety of high-value-added chemicals such as bioplastics and biofuels that serve as blend-stock of petrol, diesel and jet fuels [26,27]. Alkanes and alkyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether, derived from Methylfuran and Furfuryl alcohol respectively, are regarded as favourable substrates for producing bio-diesel [28,29]. Also, it can contribute as the precursor for the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural by way of hydroxymethylation with formaldehyde [30–32]. The US-DOE has sanctioned Methyltetrahydrofuran as a constituent of P Series type fuels that likely to extend the demand of furfural and derivatives as the price of petroleum fuels continues to rise [33]. Further, furfuryl ethyl ether is an important flavor compound indicative of beer storage and aging conditions [34]. Tetrahydrofurfuryl ether can be used to modify anionic polymerizations of conjugated diene monomers. In view of the diverse applications and high value of etherified derivatives, it is of great concern to explore the transformation of bio-refinery molecules into furfuryl alkyl ethers. The acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of furfuryl alcohol is well known. Related to this, literatures on butanolysis are limited [35]. To the best of our knowledge, few reports are available that describe synthesis of furfuryl ethers. Consequently, the etherification of HMF has well clarified that resulted in either the monoether derivative or dimers [36]. The protocols that lead to formation of furfuryl alkyl ethers by halogenation of furan alcohols followed by etherification with aliphatic alcohols. Secondly, the formation of ethoxymethylfurfural achieved from 5-chloromethylfurfural using Ar-SO3H-SBA-15 a strong Brønsted acid as the catalyst [37]. The ultimate process is the direct etherification of furfuryl alcohol and monohydric alcohol, ethanol in the presence of an acidic molecular sieve ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) catalyst, though, the selectivity of furfuryl ethyl ether was attained only 44.8% [38]. Cao et al. attained only 58.9% selectivity of methyl furfuryl ether by etherification of furfuryl alcohol with methanol using acidic zeolite HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) [39]. Antunes et al. studied one-pot conversion of furfural to useful bio-products including alkyl furfuryl ether with appreciable yield, in the presence of a Sn,Al-containing zeolite beta catalyst prepared via post-synthesis routes. This protocol is beneficial in comparison with conventional liquid-phase paths that affords less poisonous waste and avoids solvation of the metal species and hydrolysis of metal precursors which can inhibit the incorporation of the Lewis acid centres. Antunes et al. have further explored the viable valorisation of furfural via integrated reduction and acid reactions in alcohol media, to give useful bio-products, namely, furanic ethers, levulinate esters and angelica lactones at 120–150 °C, by using composite consisting of nanocrystals of Zr,Al-Beta embedded in a mesoporous matrix [40,41]. Manishkumar S. Tiwari fabricated a novel metal–acid bifunctional catalyst containing palladium and dodecatungstophosphoric acid supported on titania nanotubes and illustrated applicability for one-pot synthesis of n-pentyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether from the condensation of n-pentanol and furfuryl alcohol followed by hydrogenation [42]. Recently, one research group indicated an alternative approach of Lewis and Brønsted acidity in metal chloride catalysis in organic media for reductive etherification of furanics. Two challenging reaction pathways were proposed: direct etherification to 5(isopropoxymethyl) furfural and reductive etherification to 2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan, with the selectivity depending on the metal ion. Furfural and furfuryl alcohol are used as model substrates to scrutinize pathway separately [43]. Shinde and Rode have explored an inspiring presentation of mix catalyst system [e.g. ZrO(OH) and Zr-Mont] in a single pot for cascade reductive-etherification of HMF with secondary alcohols via MPV reduction. The advantage of the protocol is that, both catalysts were obtained by the most simple and ecological method from inexpensive and viable raw materials [44]. In parallel Padovan et al. successfully used bifunctional Lewis and Brønsted acidic zeolites for the continuous production of bio-renewable furanic ethers. In view of that, it is obvious that a grouping of Lewis and Brønsted acidity offers the best opportunity of attaining high yields and selectivity to butoxy-methyl-furan. Kaolinite catalyst with Lewis and Brønsted acid sites revealed the application for the production of a furanic ether from biomass-derived furfuryl alcohol [45]. The etherification reaction was easily performed by the catalyst without any pretreatment and was effectively recycled that offers important eco-friendly advantages in the green chemistry [46]. One more research confirmed the synthesis of furfuryl ethers, through an etherification reaction of furfuryl alcohol and short chain alkyl alcohols by using reusable ZSM-5 catalyst with sacrificial reagent, such as trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF) or triethyl orthoformate (TEOF). These protocols proceed vigorously and effectively at 40 °C with negligible hydrolysis products and humins formation [47]. Sun et al. demonstrated selective conversion of fructose to 5‑ethoxymethylfurfural and ethyl levulinate in presence of Brønsted acidic IL-based hybrid catalysts with unique hollow spherical nanospheres [48]. Moreover, the exclusive hollow spherical nanostructures with good textural properties of the catalyst found decisive roles to their ethanolysis activity and selectivity, which facilitate accessibility to acid sites, and mass transfer and diffusion. Also, deactivation of the catalyst was inhibited by carbonaceous side products and leaching can be avoided due to chemical interactions between the [C3][SO3CF3 −] groups and nitrogen-doped carbon framework. The successful synthesis of furfuryl ethyl ether via reductive etherification of furfural in ethanol over Pd/C under mild conditions, reported by Wang et al. The notable advantage of this scheme compared with the earlier hydrogenation/ etherification method lies in a much lower reaction temperature, preventing the successive hydrolysis of furfuryl ethyl ether to other by-products such as levulinic acid or its esters [49]. Recently, Li et al. demonstrated an effective reductive etherification of 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural to 2,5-bis(methoxymethyl)furan (BMMF) by using Co-400 catalyst at 90 °C, 2 MPa H2 in 1 h, with 93% yield. By increasing reaction temperature, HMF was converted completely and achieved 98.5% yield of etherified product BMMF at 140 °C, 2 MPa H2. The one-pot synthesis of furfuryl ethyl ether (FEE) over Pd nanoparticles supported on TiO2, and active carbon via the catalytic reductive etherification of furfural in ethanol was systematically studied [50]. Concurrently, a favourable biomass-derived 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) was obtained by catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural over ZrBa-SBA bimetallic catalyst in presence of isopropanol as the H-donor with 98.3% at 150 °C in 2.5 h [51,52]. Another interesting application of phase transfer catalysts was premeditated to obtained 2-((benzyloxy)metyl)furan by reaction of benzyl chloride and furfuryl alcohol with admirable yields. Among the four phase transfer catalysts, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide was found to be the best delivering 82% conversion and 100% selectivity toward the product formation. Different parameters such as effect of catalyst, speed of agitation, catalyst loading, and concentration of base, reaction temperature, and mole ratio were investigated [53]. Photo-catalysis has recognized much attention as a prospective solution to the universal energy scarcity and for countering environmental protection. Hence, renewable and clean solar energy sources are steadily attracting researchers and have presented great opportunities in applications in the past 15 years, such as water splitting to produce hydrogen, decomposition of organic water contaminants in photovoltaic solar cells [54,55] and in reduction of carbon dioxide, etc. Visible light is plentiful (43%) in nature with respect to the ultraviolet (5%) and infrared (52%), but it usually cannot be trapped directly by the substrates to initiate the reaction [56,57]. As a result, visible light photo-catalysts, act as a linking means for the energy transfer between visible light and the substrates, will be of specific significance. Hence, it is essential to nurture a precise photo-catalyst, which is intense to visible light. In the preceding decades, researcher invested a great deal of time and assets evolving visible light–active photo-catalysts. Two approaches have been suggested to fabricate visible-light response photo-catalysts [58]. One method is the alteration of the wide band gap of photo-catalysts by doping TiO2, or incorporation of transition metals, like Co2+, Ni2+ and Fe3+ in ZnO to improve the optical features of the catalysts and the other is the investigation and expansion of new photosensitive materials capable of absorbing visible light [59]. Thus one of the major advantages of photocatalytic method over current technologies specified that there is no further requirement for secondary disposal methods. Another advantage of this process is that when compared to other advanced oxidation technologies especially those using oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone, expensive oxidizing chemicals are not required as ambient oxygen is the oxidant [60]. In the present work, we focus on the porphyrins which are among the most typical macrocycles in synthetic chemistry and have been extensively accepted as a photo-catalyst that recognized as a good photosensitizer, owing to their miraculous features like admirable photochemical stability, strong visible absorption band, well known conjugated p-electronic core and long-lasting photo-excited triplet state [61]. They have high stability, flexibility and an ample variability presented either by macrocycle metallation or by different substituents at its periphery known as meso-substituents with positive Hammett constant [62]. Thus porphyrins efficiently absorb sunlight and have high molar absorption coefficients in the visible region and functioning as one of the best photosensitizers in photodynamic treatment of cancer, due to their high competence to generate free radicals and excited state species [63,64]. Furthermore, some metalloporphyrins are very good catalysts and photo-catalysts in different reactions in presence of TiO2 contributing in the photo-degradation of organic contaminants [65]. Many exertions have been accomplished in the area of porphyrins knotting them on different supports viz. cellulose and metallic oxides, considering longer photochemical stability required for their extensive activity as luminescent materials and photo-catalysts [66]. The improvement of inexpensive, effective techniques to carry out the photocatalytic reactions has received attention that would allow the production of a clean fuel (hydrogen) at low negative environmental impact and other applications like synthetic production of carbon-containing fuels (e.g. methanol) by the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and recycling of CO from the environment [67,68]. One disadvantage of molecular systems is their reusability, as the separation of the catalysts from liquid media is very challenging [69]. To address this problem, one attractive way is their immobilization in solid hosts. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have performed as promising hosts, where catalytic centres can be bounded [70–73]. A number of porphyrin-based MOFs have been described comprising various applications including photocatalytic activities and solar fuel production photocatalysis [74–77]. Recently, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, was illustrated by bioinspired molecular photo-catalysts [78–80]. To the best of our knowledge, this is foremost example of the fabrication of MFBAFPBM for photo-catalysis under visible yellow light irradiation. In this work, we have synthesized MFBAFPBM and confirmed by various characterization techniques. The photo-catalyst employed for the etherification reaction in presence yellow light at ambient conditions. The effects of catalyst loading, reaction time, concentration of the precursors and illumination on etherification furfuryl alcohol and ethyl alcohol were discussed. This protocol with optimized conditions was tested by reacting variety of alcohols with furfuryl alcohol. Suitable mechanism of the etherification of the furfuryl and ethyl alcohol was also proposed."

After completion of the reaction, an excess of sulphuric acid was removed by vacuum filtration and the product washed with diethyl ether (3 × 10 mL), dried to afford the pure product (2C) and characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Yield 90%) 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 9.81 (s, 1H), 8.22 (s, 2H), 7.97 (d, J = Hz, 1H), 7.82 (d, J = 8.00 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (q, J = 2.80 Hz, 2H), 7.53 (d, J = 8.00 Hz, 1H), 7.38 (t, J = 8.80 Hz, 3H), 6.98 (q, J = 8.00 Hz, 1H), 5.34 (s, 2H), 4.54 (t, J = 4.00 Hz, 2H), 3.14 (t, J = 8.00 Hz, 2H), 2.23 (q, J = 4.00 Hz, 2H), 1.84 (q, J = 4.00 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 196.09, 161.54, 142.96, 135.63, 131.89, 127.08, 123.40, 123.18, 122.60, 120.52, 118.69, 115.40, 109.89, 73.94, 48.28, 47.90, 23.61, 22.87 2.3.7 Synthesis of MFBAFPBM Scheme 7 .

5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2 . shows that the formation of precursors 1B, 1C and photo-catalyst 4, were confirmed by evidence of functional groups using FT-IR spectra. The spectrum (1B) clarify a broad band between 3200 and 3500 cm−1, which correspond to the stretching vibration of the two amino group [88].The bands in the array from 2854 to 2954 cm−1 represent an aromatic CH stretching. Another characteristic low frequency band at 435 cm−1, is attributed to the stretching vibration of C-Cl [89]. The formation of IL Fig. 1. (1C) from (1B) is confirmed from the IR spectrum. Here we can observed that complete disappearance of the typical C-Cl bands at 435 cm−1 which prove the creation of new C-N bond attached with 3,4,9,10 perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride [90]. In addition, intensity of the peaks is significantly increased in the region 3200 to 3500 cm−1 due to incorporation of new hydroxyl group in IL (1C) formation along with slight shifting of vibration of NH groups. The appearance of intense peaks at 1600 to 1700 cm−1 assigned to aromatic aldehyde, further confirms the existence of benzimidazole moiety entangled with salicylaldehyde [91]. Finally, the synthesis of photo-catalyst, was achieved by condensation of 1C, 2C and pyrrole. The spectrum (4) displays a broad absorption peaks at 3200 to 3500 cm−1 attributed to amino ((N–H)) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups [92]. The characteristic bands appeared at 1300 cm−1 assigned to the absorption of sulfonic acid group [93]. Moreover the bands appeared at 1591 cm−1 and 1234 cm−1 are the distinctive bands of C = N and C-N respectively which confirmed the fabrication of the photo-catalyst containing all the desired constituents. Fig. 3 . Elucidate the formation of heterogeneous solid photo-catalyst MFBAFPBM was further confirmed by 13C NMR spectroscopy exhibiting NMR signals that are strongly broadened by magnetic interactions. (Fig. 3) illustrated the clusters of peak which were measured in the 13C NMR spectrum of photo-catalyst. 13C NMR measurements were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker 400 MHz at ambient temperature using D2O solvent. As shown in (Fig. 3), the C1 and C2 carbons of MFBAFPBM resonances at −2.050 and −6.582 ppm. The wide shoulder from 37 to 56 ppm represent aliphatic C of butane sultone moiety attached to benzimidazole ring. The signal at 37.339 ppm of C7, 61.285 ppm of C4, 56.169 ppm of C3, 46.683 ppm of C5 and 67.771 ppm of C6 are recognized [94]. Other signals at 119.904 ppm of C11-12, 124.934 ppm of C13, 160.059 ppm of C9 and 161.702 ppm of C10 are assigned to phenolic rings while 128.808 ppm of C14-17, 131.301 ppm of C8 (–C = N) attributed to benzimidazole ring. Similarly signals at 183.866 ppm of C18, 188.591 ppm of C19 are allocated to (C = O) [95]. These results prove that the aldehyde groups of 1C, 2C have reacted with the pyrrole lead to the formation of photo-catalyst 4 (MFBAFPBM). The surface morphology of the acquired photo-catalyst was scrutinized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FEI SEM Quanta Inspect S50 Scanning electron microscope [Hitachi S-3400 N] operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 KV equipped with EDS-Oxford INCA PENTA system to identify the elemental dispersal on the surface of the sample. We found in the SEM spectra C, O, N, S, and Cl present on the surface of the prepared photo catalyst [96] (Fig. 4 ). Acidity of photo-catalyst permits us to evaluate their reactivity. Hammett acidity function H0 is the most universal and useful characteristic of the acid strength of solid catalysts [97]. Hammett indicators are widely used in the investigation of acid-base properties of heterogeneous catalysts. Visual or spectrophotometric observation of the colour change of an adsorbed indicator supports in the assessment of the basic or acid strength of the surface. Hammett indicators are uncharged bases that can be transformed to conjugate acids by transfer of proton. According to literature, acidity of photo-catalyst was calculated using UV–visible spectrophotometer with a basic indicator by following the concept reported in literature [98]. In the present work, H0 values of porphyrin based photo-catalyst was determined using 4-nitroaniline (50 mL) as the indicator, with 100 mg photo-catalyst. The maximum absorbance of the unprotonated form of the basic indicator in water was observed at 380 nm, attests increase in acidity of the photo-catalyst, whereas the protonated form of the indicator could not be observed because of its small molar absorptivity and its location. Thus, the ratio [I]/[IH+] was determined from the differences of measured absorbance after the addition of photo-catalyst and the relative acidity was calculated by using Eq. (1) as a Hammett function (1) H 0 . H = pK I aq + log I / I H + Hammett values (H0) of the synthesized photo-catalyst was found to be H0 = 0.76 and correlated with their catalytic activity. (Fig. 5 ) The catalytic activity was enhanced with the acidity of the photo-catalyst which reveal the formation of hydrogen bonding of photo-catalyst to the substrate and this could play a crucial role to facilitate the product formation. Fig. 6 . presented the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and corresponding pore size distribution curve of the photo-catalyst. It can be clearly seen from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm that synthesized photo-catalyst can be recognized to type II (or type IV), which suggests a mesoporous pore texture. Furthermore, from the isotherms of photo-catalyst, it is apparent that the total surface area of photo-catalyst and pore width is found to be 13.22 m2/g and 5.80 nm respectively, which is comparatively larger than the reported photo-catalyst [99]. Moreover the surface area of the photo-catalyst will be more vital for effective catalysis. The thermal stability of the photo-catalyst was studied by using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) using a TGA instrument (TA Instruments - Q50Pl), with 10 °C/min heating, in Nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 800 °C. The TGA thermogram curves of the photo-catalyst (4) is shown in (Fig. 7 ). There are four phases in the TGA curve of the photo-catalyst. The porphyrin began to decompose at 101 °C involves, loss of less than 10% of the mass due to the elimination of physisorbed water [100]. While, the second stage (from 101 to 339 °C) includes the collapse of the meso-phenyl group by decomposition of –OH/ benzimidazole groups with the loss of 33% of its original weight. Beyond the 340 °C temperature, there is a continuous decomposition of porphyrin scaffold up to 800 °C. It is very well to note that the porphyrin photo-catalyst is so stable in air that it could be desiccated at temperatures up to 339 °C. The characterization of the optical properties of the photocatalyst needs the use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to know the optical bandgap of MFBAFPBM from a Tauc plot (Fig. 8 ) showed the UV–vis DRS spectra, indicating band gap of MFBAFPBM photocatalyst by the intercept of tangents to the plots of (ahv)1/2 versus photo energy is 1.29 eV. This is associated with the strong absorption characteristics of MFBAFPBM in the visible region accelerating photocatalytic activity at normal temperature under visible light irradiations. The progress of ethyl alcohol and furfuryl alcohol reaction was studied using an NMR-based technique to examine the formation of ethyl furfuryl ether, at different duration. Spectra were collected with a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer by using default instrument constraints for all experimentations [101]. The 1HNMR spectra (Fig. 9 ) were recorded with aliquots of the reaction mixture containing furfuryl alcohol, ethyl alcohol by separating heterogeneous photo-catalyst from 0 to 18 h. At the beginning of model reaction, (0 h), all the expected peaks of ethanol and furfuryl alcohol are found in 1HNMR spectrum (Fig. 8, 0 h). The formation of ethyl furfuryl ether steadily improved from 3 h to 18 h with the highest yield 87% in 12 h, in presence of heterogeneous photo-catalyst. The only difference in 1HNMR spectra of the reactants and the product is the disappearance of OH proton (D and D’). The disappearance of the primary alcoholic peaks at 4.25 ppm of reactants and slight deshielding of –CH2 singlet at 3.25 ppm of furfuryl group were recognized in the kinetics. (Fig.0 h, 3 h, 9 h,12 h, 18 h). The observation indicated that etherification of furfuryl alcohol completed in 12 h under optimized conditions [102]. The stability and reusability is a significant feature for heterogeneous photo-catalyst. The stability and ease of recovery of cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 3 in relations of efficiency with etherification reaction, over the number of cycles are greatly preferred and it is the best if the efficiency is constant and decreasing slightly with each cycle. The evaluations of stability tests were achieved by repeating the reaction nine times using reused photo-catalyst. The recovered photo-catalyst was separated after each experiment and washed repeatedly with acetone [3 X 10 mL], dried in the hot air oven and utilized for next run. The data acquired was indicated in (Fig. 10 ), pointed out that there is no perceptible drop in photocatalytic activity up to nine cycles. It was noted that photocatalytic etherification decreased by 16% at 9th cycle. It specifies that photo-catalyst fabricated in the current work is extremely stable and reusable photo-catalyst. The projected mechanism of photocatalytic etherification of furfuryl alcohol and ethyl alcohol by MFBAFPBM is shown in (Fig. 11 ). It is identified that, on absorption of visible light, the photo-catalyst, (MFBAFPBM) generates electron-hole pair depicted as below: Photo-catalyst + visible light → e − + h+ The porphyrin photo-catalyst could enable the separation of the electron–hole pair and stimulate the interfacial electron transfer process. The progression of single electron oxidation of furfuryl alcohol occurred in the presence of the excited state of photo-catalyst to afford the furfuryl radical (A) and •OH radical. The single electron transfer that generate the furfuryl radical (A) and •OH radicals (B) were supported by GC–MS spectra along with the formation of desired product. (Fig. 11). During the reaction, trapping of •OH radical was confirmed by isopropyl alcohol as a radical scavenger (Ref supporting file Fig. S35). Next, attack of furfuryl radical to the ethyl alcohol B delivered the intermediate C, which underwent rearrangement to form the desired product D along with generation of •H radical [103]. The coupling of •OH radical and •H radical gave the water molecule with generation of electron that recombine with excited photo-catalyst to get reduced state. Thus, we can conclude that the etherification mechanism of furfuryl alcohol and ethyl alcohol by prepared photo-catalyst comprise the generation of electron and •OH as reported in other photo-catalytic methods [104]."
6,Optimization of process parameters for etherification of furfuryl alcohol,"3.1 Optimization of process parameters for etherification of furfuryl alcohol Initially, experiments were conducted by one factor at a time, to know the selections of the three parameters, catalyst dose, illumination time, effect of light intensity and ratio of the substrates (Table 1 ). To augment the values of various operational parameters influencing the etherification, experiments were carried out by changing the catalyst dose MFBAFPBM from 5 mg to 30 mg, illumination time i.e. duration (6 – 30 h) and ratio of furfuryl alcohol to ethyl alcohol (1:1.2)."
7,Typical experiment for photo-catalytic reactions,"3.2 Typical experiment for photo-catalytic reactions (Scheme 8 ) In a model reaction, a reaction substrates furfuryl alcohol (1.96 g, 20 mmol), ethyl alcohol (1.10 g, 24 mmol), containing catalyst (20 mg), was charged into a 25 mL glass bottle and capped properly to avoid spilling. The reactor was kept in a rectangular home-made photo-catalytic reactor equipped with source of yellow light (5 W LED) from both the side and an exhaust to escape excess of heat. The distance between the reaction glass bottle and the source of light was 10 cm. The reaction mixture was kept under constant stirring at 600 rpm until the completion of reaction. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration; the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL) to get ethyl furfuryl ether. The organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and the desired product was attained by the removal of ethyl acetate under vacuum using rota-vapour. 3.2.1 Effect of photo-catalyst dose The major impact on etherification reaction was found by the quantity of photo-catalyst. The experiments were conducted by changing catalyst dose from 5 mg to 30 mg for substrate ratio of furfuryl alcohol (1.96 g, 20 mmol) to ethyl alcohol (1.10 g, 24 mmol) (1:1.2 mol) to study the effect of catalyst loading on the etherification. As indicated in Fig. 12 the yield of the product found to improve with increasing the dosage from 5 mg to 20 mg catalyst [105]. It may be due to the increase of catalyst quantity, total active sites intensified, that facilitates exposure of more active sites on catalyst surface. Further increase in catalyst dosage do not influence on the yield of product may be due to surface agglomeration and diminishing the surface active sites. Therefore further studies were carried out using 20 mg catalyst dose. 3.2.2 Influence of illumination time Taking into account the identified optimized catalyst dose, we have studied effect of illumination time from 6 h to 30 h on etherification reaction that demonstrated a significant contribution on the photocatalytic process by increasing the yield of products with respect to increasing illumination. It has been found that (Fig. 13 ) the yield of ethyl furfuryl ether increased speedily with radiance time from 61% at 6 h to 95% at 24 h, because more photo-electron are generated with increasing the illumination time. There was no appreciable change in the yield (95%) of product formation after 24 h illumination. This may be due to aggregation of photo-catalyst or active sites engaged by products that minimized the number of active sites of catalyst [106]. 3.2.3 Effect of ratio of reactants Next, by taking optimized catalyst dose (20 mg) and illumination time (12 h); we have studied the photocatalytic model reaction by varying the ratio of furfuryl alcohol and ethanol to evaluate the suitable composition for better yield of the product. The effect of different molar ratios of furfuryl alcohol to ethanol for ethyl furfuryl ether production was investigated in 25 mL glass bottle. The molar ratio ranging from 1:1, 1:1.1, 1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.4 and 1:1.5 was examined in presence of yellow light (5 W) using 20 mg photo-catalyst at ambient temperature. From Fig. 14 , the highest yield 95% of ethyl furfuryl ether was obtained when the furfuryl alcohol to ethanol molar ratio was 1:1.2. With higher molar ratios there is no considerable change in the yield of product. Present study confirms that with molar ratio of furfuryl alcohol to ethanol of 1:1.2 maximum yield was achieved in 12 h 87% in presence of other optimized reaction conditions [107]. 3.2.4 Effect of light intensity The effect of light intensity for the ethyl furfuryl ether production in the presence of optimized conditions, substrates were allowed to undergo etherification in presence of different light (white) intensities from 5 W, 9 W and 12 W LED. From the Fig. 15 it was observed that increasing light intensities, using 9 W and 12 W affording 95% yield at 12 h compare to 5 W 87%. There was no significant effect on yield of ether with change in duration of illumination from 12 to 18 h. On the other hand 5 W light source was found optimum for the photo-catalyst to perform the reaction [108]. 3.2.5 The effect of wavelength of the irradiation on the etherification of furfuryl alcohol with ethyl alcohol. The effect of wavelength of the irradiation was studied to know the precise wavelength of visible light from 400 nm to 750 nm suitable for photo-catalysis. In this study equimolar concentration of ethyl alcohol and furfuryl alcohol was used with a catalyst amount of 20 mg and light illumination of blue, yellow and white 5 W LED lamps. Fig. 16 demonstrates the yield dependence of ethyl furfuryl ether on the incident wavelength. The results indicated that photo-catalyst produced comparable results with respect to formation of desired product. However, it shows that higher photocatalytic yield achieved under irradiation of yellow light with 95% yield under optimized conditions. 3.2.6 Influence of volume of reaction media Finally, to prove the efficiency of photo-catalyst, effect of the volume of the reaction media, was demonstrated with model reactions using optimized conditions [109]. In a photo-catalytic method, the source of light should be optimum. If the light energy is not adequately provided, the initiation of photo-catalysis may not occur at optimum condition. On the contrary, when the light energy is over supplied, it will be unused and emit in the form of heat. Therefore, one approach to avoid such inadequate or over supplied of the light energy during the photocatalytic process is by monitoring the volume of the reaction media, to provide required light energy at an adequate level. In this study, the different volumes of the ethanol and furfuryl alcohol ranging from 10 mL to 100 mL was evaluated using optimized reactions conditions. The 90% yield of product was achieved till 90 mL (max volume) volume of the reaction media in presence yellow light. This proved that photo-catalyst is appropriate to transmit the light to entire reaction volume in the reactor. However, the yield of products slightly reduced when the volume of the reaction media was higher than 100 mL. With the optimized conditions in hand, we have performed etherification of furfuryl alcohol with methanol, n-butanol and n-octanol to give methyl furfuryl ether, n-butyl-furfuryl ether and furfuryl n-octyl ether respectively with good to excellent yields (Table 2 ). 3.2.7 Blending of furanyl octyl ether with diesel The successful generation of real diesel-range products by etherification of hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) was reported using nucleophilic substitution. The process gives high yields of EMF, however formation of HCl by-product imparted restriction which lead to cause premature wear. The curiosity for the synthesis of furanyl ethers has encouraged as the combustion of 17 wt% blends in diesel have already been presented to achieve well in diesel engines with a 16% reduction in soot [110]. The harmful emissions can be reduced by blending oxygenated furanyl ether with petrodiesel using blends that matches the desired cetane number and higher heating value of petrodiesel. The combustion, performance and discharge characteristics of the engine intensely depend upon the physicochemical properties of the fuel. In this work, different physicochemical properties of the neat diesel and their blends were measured in the laboratory according to the standard test methods (Supplementary file Fig. S40 and S41). The basic fuel properties such as density, kinematic viscosity, calorific value, Cetane number, flash point, fire point and pour point were measured. The results and standard test methods through which the tests have been carried out are mentioned in the report. Miscibility of furanyl octyl ether in the diesel fuel is the essential parameter for steady working of the engine. Preliminary evaluation tests on the solubility of furanyl octyl ether in the diesel fuel indicated that the mixing was excellent in any the proportions with no phase separation without using any emulsifying agent. Cetane number decides the ignition quality of a fuel. The Cetane number of commercial diesel fuel is normally in the range 40 to 55 [111]. The method used to determine the ignition quality in terms of Cetane number is determined by ASTM D 976. In this investigation, the Cetane number of diesel, 10%, 20% and 30% blended samples were performed. From the Table 3 , it was observed that there was no change in Cetane number of the neat sample and blended diesel samples. The various physicochemical properties of the fuels were tested in the laboratory according to the standard test methods and the results are summarized in Table 3. The density of blended fuels were measured in the testing laboratory according to the ASTM D 1298 standard test method. The results indicated that density of blended samples almost same for 20% blended sample but slightly reduces for 10% blended sample compare to neat diesel. Similarly, kinematic viscosity of blended samples studied rendering to ASTM D 445 and found drastically decrease for 10% sample and increases for 20% blending of furfuryl octyl ether. Wu et al. and He et al. have described that the density, viscosity of the oxygenated fuel play an important role on the upgrading of atomization behavior. They also supported that the spray quality of low viscosity oxygenated blended fuels improves as compared to neat diesel. Thus, the combustion efficiency enhances because of heat losses in the cylinder are decreased due to lower flame temperature of furfuryl octyl ether blend than that of sample diesel [112]. The calorific value of blended samples and neat diesel were measured by ASTM D 240 standard method. It is observed that the calorific value reduces for 20% blended sample due to increase in concentration of furfuryl octyl ether in the blends that upsurge in oxygen percentage in the blends while 10% blended sample do not show significant variation in calorific value [113]. The flash point is used in shipping and safety regulations to define flammable and combustible mixture. The flash point was determined in the laboratory according to ASTM D 93 standard method. In this study the flash point of the blended samples was found increasing with respect to neat sample [114]. Fire point is the minimum temperature at which the flammablevapors will continue to form and steadily burn once ignited. Fire points of the fuel blends were measured by ASTM D 93 standard method. In comparison to neat diesel fuel, the fire point value of blended diesel fuel sample (10% and 20%) were found to be high which ensures the safe transport and storage of biodiesel fuels [115].Pour point is often used to specify cold temperature usability of fuel oils. The pour point of blended samples and neat diesel are measured by ASTM D 97 standard method. It is observed that the pour point gradually increases for 10% blended biodiesel sample and slightly reduces for 20% blended sample compare to neat diesel [116]. Table 4 shows the comparison of the results of the present protocol against recently reported studies is presented. It is showing that synthesized heterogeneous photocatalyst (MFBAFPBM) afford good catalytic activity. Table 4 provides an evaluation of the etherification of furfuryl alcohol and ethyl alcohol using photo-catalyst and other heterogeneous catalyst. In comparison, work done by Chaffey et al. used ZSM-5 reported 60% yield [117] compared to Liet al. (66.5%) [118] and Gaudin et al. (75%) [119] with Co and Aberlyst catalystrespectively. Wang et al. confirmed Pd/C for reductive etherification of furfural in ethanol with 82% yield [120]. and Pariente et al. testified etherification of glycerol with Aberlyst A15 [121]. Argouarch et al. illustrated reductive etherification of aldehyde with methyl and ethyl alcohol by using Iron (II) ferrocene catalyst which is the closest comparison to this study with respect to yield [122]. Comparison between heterogeneous catalysts revealed that MFBAFPBM contributed for the better yield of ethyl furfuryl ether under optimized conditions using 5 W LED yellow visible light."
8,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized metal free sulfonic acid-functionalized porphyrin, entangled with benzimidazolium moiety (MFBAFPBM) and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Fourier transform NMR (FT-NMR), 13C NMR spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Consequently MFBAFPBM displayed effective heterogeneous photo-catalytic activity for sustainable etherification of furfuryl alcohol, with several alcohols using yellow visible (5 W LED) light. This protocol proceeded at ambient temperature lower than those of the reported etherification methods, with higher yields of furfuryl ethers. The low temperature route enhances the selectivity by lowering the formation of humin and other hydrolysis products. Further with optimized conditions, variety of furfuryl ethers employing 1:1.2 (Furfuryl alcohol : ROH) ratio, with high yields were obtained by reacting furfuryl alcohol with a range of alcohols such as ethanol, 1-butanol, 1-octanol in presence of visible yellow light by using 20 mg heterogeneous catalyst (Supporting information S43-S45). The Hammett acidity (Ho = 0.76) was determined and found appreciable proton levels in the catalyst. Here the MFBAFPBM photo-catalyst acquiring large surface area and reactive SO3H groups acts as a very reactive heterogeneous solid acid catalyst under metal free conditions. The higher catalytic presentation can be related to good Hammett acidity of the catalyst having suitable porphyrin chromophore with ionic benzimidazole moiety on perylene support. As a result, production of another prospective diesel candidate furfuryl-octyl-ether has been optimized to generate renewable fuel additives without the use of precious metals. A study for optimizing the reaction parameters such as catalyst loading, duration, intensity of light, wavelength and mole ratio of reactants has been performed and 20 mg catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity with 95% yield of furfuryl ethyl ether. A kinetic study showing the evidences for the progress of etherification of furfuryl alcohol was also confirmed by 1HNMR. Yet in terms of reusability, that produced significantly high amount of furfuryl alkyl ether at room temperature in presence 5 W LED, preferred an appropriate photo-catalyst as it was easily separated from the reaction mixture for next cycle, nine times without loss of catalytic performances. Finally, we have blended furfuryl-octyl ether with diesel (10%, 20% and 30%) and measured various parameters by standard methods and the results found to be much appreciable than that of real diesel sample. Thus MFBAFPBM makes it a capable candidate photocatalyst for the etherification of furfuryl alcohol with minimum quantity of photocatalyst under the irradiation of visible light. The improvement of visible light tempted photocatalytic activity was effectively achieved using bioinspired photocatalyst with low band gap in home-made photoreactor. This protocol is environmentally benign and economical, permits production of bio-renewable, furfuryl-octyl ether which possess prospective as fuel additives."
