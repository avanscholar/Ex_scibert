0,Introduction,"The effective conversion of solar energy is a feasible way to solve energy and environmental problems [1,2]. Hydrogen energy is an ideal choice owing to its environmental friendliness, cleanliness and renewability [3]. Therefore, a variety of materials capable of transforming light energy have been extensively investigated, such as TiO2 [4–6], Cu2O [7], Ti3C2 [8] and C3N4 [9,10]. TiO2 has been widely used in the field of photocatalysis due to its non-toxic and easy preparation characteristics. However, the band gap of TiO2 is 3.2 eV, which is a semiconductor material excited by ultraviolet light [11]. In order to improve the light-harvesting ability, TiO2 is usually combined with noble metal (Au [12], Ag [13], Pt [14]) and other narrow band gap semiconductors (CdS [15], Cu2O [16] and Fe2O3 [17]). When TiO2 is combined with precious metals, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) will cause the composite material to exhibit a certain absorption capacity in the visible light range, enhancing photocatalytic activity [18–20]. In addition, Cu2O as light-absorbing substance is also usually allied with TiO2 [21–23]. Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor with 2.0–2.2 eV band gap [24,25], which shows considerable absorbency in visible wavelengths. Cu2O is also widely used in photocatalysis due to its non-toxicity, low cost and easy preparation. The staggered energy band arrangement and the formation of heterojunction can promote the formation of Type-II electron transfer mode between composite materials, thereby improving photocatalytic performance [26,27]. Therefore, Cu2O/TiO2 composites have been investigated in many fields, such as photocatalytic H2 production, degrading organic matter, and CO2 reduction [28–30]. Lv et al. [31] successfully loaded Cu2O onto the surface of TiO2 nanospheres through hydrothermal process and realized photodissociation of seawater to produce hydrogen. Deng et al. [3] deposited the Cu2O layer on the TiO2 film by laser evaporation of Cu2O. Yan et al. [32] synthesized the Cu2O/TiO2 materials by calcination and realized the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. Additionally, the physical mixing method will also be convenient for synthesizing Cu2O/TiO2 composites. Compared to other methods, the pristine morphology of the two materials will not change via physical mixing. The different crystal faces have significant impact on the catalytic activity [33–35]. Therefore, the physical mixing makes it possible to systematically explore the influence of different exposed plane contacts on the photocatalytic performance. Xu et al. [36] synthesized Cu2O octadecahedra with {110} and {100} facets and loaded TiO2 onto the Cu2O surface through mechanical mixing, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the degradation of methyl orange. For Cu2O/TiO2 composites, the key factor for the improvement of its catalytic performance is the formation of p-n junction [37]. In other words, due to the difference in the concentration of electrons and holes, an internal electric field is formed between the interface of TiO2 and Cu2O. Under the action of internal electric field, the efficiency of charge separation can be significantly improved, which more conducive to electrons and holes to participate in the redox reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare Cu2O/TiO2 composites with high photocatalytic activity. In this work, Cu2O nanocube was synthesized by oil-water two-phase process, and then Cu2O/TiO2 composites were fabricated by physical mixing method. Among the prepared materials, the CT-70 (the additive amount of TiO2 was 70 wt%) showed the highest catalytic activity in photocatalytic H2 production. The photoelectrochemical tests indicated that the formation of heterojunction could significantly reduce charge transfer resistance and enhance photocurrent density."
1,Experiment section,
2,Reagents and chemicals,"2.1 Reagents and chemicals Cu2SO4·5H2O (≥ 9.0%, AR), sodium bis(2-ethylhexylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT, ≥ 97%, Aldrich), absolute ethanol (C2H5OH, ≥ 99.7%, Kermel), NaOH (≥ 96%, Kermel), ascorbic acid (≥ 99.7%, Kermel) and ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ cm) were used. All chemicals used were not further purified."
3,Fabrication of the catalytsts,"2.2 Fabrication of the catalytsts Cu2O was fabricated by oil-water two-phase process. Firstly, 1 mmol Cu2SO4·5H2O was dissolved in 60 mL ultrapure water (water phase), and 2 mmol AOT was dissolved in 20 mL absolute ethanol (oil phase). Then, Cu2SO4·5H2O solution was dropwise added to AOT solution by stirring constantly for 1 h. Next, 15 mL (0.5 M) NaOH was added to the mixed solution of Cu2SO4·5H2O and AOT, and stirred for 30 min, followed by adding ascorbic acid (2 mmol) into the solution under constant stirring for 2 h. Finally, the suspension kept at 80 °C for 3 h in 100 mL stainless steel autoclave. The obtained samples were washed 3 times by deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried overnight. The preparation of TiO2 is based on the reported literature [38]. The mass of prepared Cu2O/TiO2 composite material was determined to be 200 mg. Different qualities of Cu2O and TiO2 were weighed, and dispersed in 100 ml of ultrapure water under vigorous stirring for 30 min. The samples were collected by centrifugation, and dried overnight. The products were denoted as CT-20, CT-40, CT-60, CT-70 and CT-80 based on the mass percentage of TiO2, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using German Bruker D8 diffractometer equipment. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images were collected with using a JEM-7001F microscope. The lattice structure was obtained by JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on a Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA). Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) of the catalysts was performed using UV-U3900 UV-vis spectrophotometer. BET measurement (Belsorp-mini II, Japan) was characterized to analyze the specific surface area of the samples."
5,Catalytic activity evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic activity evaluation Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was performed in an 80 mL quartz tube. For each reaction, 20 mg catalyst was dispersed in 20 mL solution (CH3OH:H2O = 1:4). Subsequently, Ar is passed into the quartz tube for 30 min to exhaust the air in the quartz tube. Finally, the photocatalysts were illuminated under a xenon lamp (without a light filter) for 6 h and hydrogen data were recorded by a gas chromatograph every hour."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The crystalline structure and microstructure of catalysts,"3.1 The crystalline structure and microstructure of catalysts Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Cu2O, TiO2 and CT-70. The diffraction peaks at 29.5°, 36.4°, 42.3°, 61.3°, 73.5° and 77.3° correspond to (110), (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) of Cu2O (JCPDS 05-0667), respectively . The diffraction peaks at 14.2°, 24.9°, 28.6° and 48.5° can be indexed to the (001), (110), (002) and (020) of TiO2 (JCPDS 46-1238), respectively. Similarly, the diffraction peaks of CT-70 also correspond to the standard card of Cu2O and TiO2, which indicate Cu2O/TiO2 composites were fabricated successfully. And Fig. S1 shows that the pyrolysis process of all samples is roughly similar. Weight loss is mainly due to the elimination of a small amount of physically adsorbed water and further decomposition of organic residues. The BET surface area of the samples were investigated by using nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements (Fig. S2). The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated as 10.3, 353.5 and 200.8 m2 g−1 for Cu2O, TiO2 and CT-70, respectively (Fig. S2 (a)). It can be seen that TiO2 nanosheets have a largest specific surface area, and the specific surface area of CT-70 is 20 times higher than that of pure Cu2O. A larger specific surface area can accommodate more surface active sites and facilitate the transport of charge carriers, which is beneficial for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. S2 (b), CT-70 has a clear pore size distribution at 4 nm.which may offer more exposed sites. The morphology evolution processes of Cu2O were explored via adjusting the amount of reagents added. The SEM images of Cu2O products are shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 (a–c) shows the effect of water to alcohol ration on Cu2O. The ratio of water to absolute ethanol in Fig. 3 (a–c) is 4:4, 3:5 and 1:7, respectively, and the SEM images of Cu2O present inhomogeneous states. This phenomenon may be because the ratio of water to alcohol affects the uniformity of micelles in the solution. Fig. 3 (d–f) are the morphology images of 10, 20 and 25 mL of NaOH. As shown in Fig. 3 (d–f), the amount of NaOH has a huge impact on the morphology of Cu2O. When the amount of NaOH gradually increased, Cu2O evolved from a cubic shape to an octahedral shape. The influence of AOT on the morphology of Cu2O is shown in Fig. 3 (g–i). Similarly, when the amount of AOT is not optimal, the micelles in the solution will become non-uniform, so non-uniform Cu2O particles appear in the synthesized material."
8,XPS analysis,"3.2 XPS analysis In order to reveal the surface chemical state, XPS analysis were utilized. In Fig. 4 (a), the two main peaks of binding energy at 932.4 and 952.2 eV correspond to Cu (I) 2p3/2 and Cu (I) 2p1/2, respectively. Furthermore, there are two minor peaks at 933.3 and 953.5 eV, which indicates the presence of small amounts of Cu2+. This is because Cu2O is oxidized in air. The peaks of Cu 2p in Cu2O/TiO2 composites have shifted toward low binding energy, which indicate the chemical environment of Cu element is affected by the introduction of a larger number of TiO2. In Fig. 4 (b), the characteristic binding energies located at 457.26 and 463.03 eV can be ascribed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ti4+ in TiO2 [40]."
9,Optical analysis,"3.3 Optical analysis In order to evaluate the ability of materials to absorb light, UV-vis diffuse reflectance test was performed. It can be seen in Fig. 5 (a) that the absorption edge of TiO2 is at approximately 360 nm, which matches the intrinsic band gap of anatase TiO2 (Eg = 3.18 eV). The Cu2O shows certain absorption intensity in the wavelength range 200–600 nm. When Cu2O combined with TiO2, composite materials also have visible light absorption capacity. And the more Cu2O content in the composite material, the stronger the light absorption capacity. The bandgap valves of semiconductors can be estimated by the formula [31], αhν = K (hν - Eg)n/2, where α is absorption coefficient, ν is light frequency, K is a constant, and Eg is the band gap. For n-semiconductors, the value of n is 4. As for p-semiconductors, n is equal to 1. Therefore, the bandgap energy of Cu2O and TiO2 are 1.97 and 3.18 eV according to Tauc plots in Fig. 5 (b)."
10,Test of electrochemical performance,"3.4 Test of electrochemical performance Fig. 6 (a) and (b) are Mott-Schottky curves measured at frequency of 1000 and 1500 Hz, where Ag/AgCl electrode is used as the reference electrode. The negative slope of Cu2O indicates Cu2O is p-type semiconductor, and the positive slope of TiO2 suggests TiO2 is n-type semiconductor. Obviously, the flat band position of Cu2O and TiO2 located at 1.08 V and -0.42 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The flat band potential can be approximately equal to the valence band potential for p-type semiconductor, while that of n-type semiconductor can be identified as the conduction band value [41,42]. Therefore, the valance band (VB) of Cu2O is 1.08 eV, and the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 is -0.42 eV. The i-t curves were tested to evaluate light response capacity of Cu2O, TiO2 and Cu2O/TiO2 composites. In Fig. 6 (c), the photocurrent intensity of CT-70 is significantly higher than other materials. The order of photocurrent density is: CT-70 (37 μA cm−2) > CT-80 (12.8 μA cm−2) > CT-60 (5.4 μA cm−2) > TiO2 (4 μA cm−2) > Cu2O (1.4 μA cm−2). The high photocurrent response indicates CT-70 can easily be excited by light to generate photoelectrons [43,44]. The EIS test is performed to compare the charge transfer resistance of pre-preapred catalysts, in which the distances of semicircles represent electron transfer resistance. In Fig. 6 (d), the sequence of charge transfer resistance is: CT-70 (53 Ω) < CT-80 (69 Ω) < CT-60 (475 Ω) <TiO2 (2490 Ω) < Cu2O (4559 Ω). The CT-70 exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance, which suggests that CT-70 has excellent charge transfer rate [45,46]."
11,Photocatalytic test and mechanism,"3.5 Photocatalytic test and mechanism The photocatalytic H2 production experiments were carried out under the condition of Xe lamp as light source and methanol as sacrificial agent. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the photocatalytic H2 generation activities of Cu2O/TiO2 composites are increasing with the content of TiO2 from 0 to 70 wt % and further increasing the mass fraction of TiO2 to 80 wt % results in the obvious decrease of the photocatalytic performance. The order of photocatalytic H2 production performance of as-synthesized material is: CT-70 (8.33 mmol g−1) > CT-80 (8.07 mmol g−1) > CT-60 (7.45 mmol g−1) > CT-40 (5.35 mmol g−1) > CT-20 (1.29 mmol g−1) > TiO2 (0.17 mmol g−1) > Cu2O (0.02 mmol g−1). The photocatalytic capable of CT-70 is 416 and 49-flod higher than that of Cu2O and TiO2, respectively. Catalyst amount and many other factors are important, and the 10, 20, 30 mg catalyst amount were also compared in the Fig. S5. In addition, we compared the photocatalytic H2 production performance of this work with other Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalysts, and the results are shown in Table S1. Moreover, after 18 h of light irradiation, the photocatalytic activity of CT-70 can still be maintained at 95.80% (see Fig. 7 (b)). The excellent stability is attributed to the combination of TiO2 and Cu2O, which can reduce the photocorrosion of Cu2O. According to the Mott-Schottky plots and the Tauc curves, the conduction band of Cu2O can be calculated as -0.89 eV. Similarly, the valence band value of TiO2 can be determined as 2.76 eV. Therefore, the detailed energy band diagram of Cu2O and TiO2 can be shown in Fig. 7 (c). When p-type semiconductor is in contact with n-type semiconductor, an internal electric field will be formed at the interface. Under the influence of internal electric field, the photogenerated electrons and holes will migrate according to the Type-II mechanism [47,48]. In this mode of electronic transfer, the holes in the valance band of TiO2 will transfer to Cu2O VB. Meanwhile, electrons will migrate from the conduction band of Cu2O to TiO2 CB. The holes accumulated in the Cu2O valence band will oxidize methanol, and the electrons accumulated in the Cu2O conduction band will reduce H+ to H2. Such an electron transfer mode will greatly reduce the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes, remarkably boosting photocatalytic H2 generation ability of composite materials."
12,Conclusion,"Cu2O/TiO2 composite materials with excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity were successfully prepared by a routine of mechanical mixing. The photocatalytic H2 production performance of CT-70 is 416 and 49 times that of Cu2O and TiO2. The formation of p-n heterojunction effectively promotes charges separation, which results in the improvement of photocatalytic H2 efficiency."
