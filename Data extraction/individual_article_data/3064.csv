0,Introduction,"Aviation transport demonstrates excellent development prospect due to its high efficiency and rapid speed [1–3]. However, the jet fuel conventionally produced from fossil fuels has brought about a large amount of greenhouse gas [4,5]. To alleviate the depletion of fossil fuels and reduce the environmental impact, the investigation of the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to aviation fuel has become a hotpot due to the renewability, abundance, and carbon neutral characteristics of biomass [6–8]. Currently, the technical routes of biomass aviation fuel complied with the standard of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) [9,10] mainly include hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) [11,12], gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (GFT) [13], direct sugar to hydrocarbon (DSHC) [14], and alcohol to jet fuel (ATJ) [15,16]. Among these routes, HEFA is the most mature technology, but its production cost is relatively high due to the limited availability of feedstock. Similarly, ATJ and DSCH are the feasible technical routes, but it was reported that they also have high production costs due to the use of sugar rich feedstock [3,15–17]. GFT is the most well-developed technology for bio-jet fuel from lignocellulosic biomass and can obtain a wide variety of fuels [18,19]. However, biomass gasification and syngas reforming at high-temperature and pressure cause some challenges, such as difficulty in biomass feeding, high production costs related to operating cost and capital intensity, etc. The aqueous-phase conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bio-jet fuel has attracted a worldwide attention in recent years due to the mild operating condition and broad feedstocks [20,21]. Compared to GFT, the aqueous-phase conversion can avoid the high-temperature gasification and reforming for the production of syngas [22]. Some studies on the conversion of lignocellulose biomass to jet fuel-range hydrocarbons showed that the maximum carbon yield of aviation fuels from hemicellulose and cellulose derived from wood feedstock could be up to 80% and 50%, respectively [18,23]. Moreover, several important platform molecules, including furfural, levulinic acid (LA), and polyols to aviation fuel by various conversion pathways were summarized [24]. The results showed that hydroxylalkylation pathway and aldol condensation pathway had obvious advantages, and the suggested platform molecules (furfural and LA) could be directly produced by lignocellulosic biomass. To increase the yield of bio-jet fuel derived from the aqueous-phase conversion of lignocellulose biomass, several researchers carried out hydrothermal depolymerization experiments of lignin to achieve aviation fuel-range hydrocarbons in recent years [25–27]. The production of C8–C15 bio-jet fuel from lignin can be accomplished by one-step or two-step processes [28]. The one-step method involves the direct catalytic depolymerization of lignin to hydrocarbons [29,30]. More researchers focus on the two-step method, which involves the degradation of lignin first to phenolic monomers and dimers, followed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to generate hydrocarbons [25,31–34]. These studies show that it is feasible to produce bio-jet fuel from lignin. Moreover, the conversion of lignin can be up to 37.5%∼67.1% and the conversion of monomers and dimers to hydrocarbons can exceed 90% [34–36]. The aqueous-phase conversion to bio-jet fuels is a quite complicated process, involving the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, aldol condensation, and HDO. Therefore, a number of researchers carried out the process simulation and optimization to improve the efficiency of energy conversion and the yield of bio-jet fuel [22,37–40]. Some [22,37,38] conducted energy and economic analysis for the aqueous-phase conversion of corn stover and corncob to produce bio-jet fuel based on a 100 t/a-scale demonstration plant by Aspen Plus software. The results show that the yield of bio-jet fuel can reach 80–100 kg/t-bio and only 16% of energy of corn stover is transferred into that of bio-jet fuel, in which lignin is combusted to provide the required heat for the system. Considering that hydrogen is the raw material required for HDO, some researchers have examined the effect of lignin gasification for hydrogen on the system performance of lignocellulose-based bio-jet fuel [39,40]. Comparative studies of the different hydrogen sources show that the cost of bio-jet fuel in the case of natural gas reforming for hydrogen source is less than that in the lignin gasification case due to its increased electricity consumption and capital costs. Moreover, the lignin gasification for hydrogen causes a lack of heat required by the biorefinery process [39]. Efficiency is the key indicator of biomass conversion processes, and the above-mentioned literatures mainly employed energy efficiency to assess the bio-jet fuel production processes. However, exergy analysis, which can reflect the change of energy quality, is rarely concerned. One report on exergy analysis and cumulative exergy analysis based on life cycle assessment (LCA) showed that the production of hydrogen from lignin can achieve higher renewability [40]. Previous studies of the thermodynamic performance of aqueous-phase conversion to bio-jet fuel generally focused on lignin used for combustion to generate heat and electricity or gasification for hydrogen, which restricts the bio-jet fuel yield. However, the aqueous-phase conversion of lignin combined with the hemicellulose and cellulose to bio-jet fuel has not been reported. The recent studies indicate that not only cellulose and hemicellulose components of lignocellulosic biomass can be converted to aviation fuels via aqueous-phase process, but also the lignin component can be converted to cycloalkanes or aromatics with C8–C15 as bio-jet fuel. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out simulations and thermodynamic performance analyses of bio-jet fuel derived from full components of lignocellulose biomass by aqueous-phase conversion. On the basis of the above analyses, this study aims to maximize the target production of bio-jet fuel and increase energy and exergy efficiencies of the aqueous-phase process by utilizing the full components in lignocellulosic biomass including cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. We proposed the aqueous-conversion process by utilizing the lignin to produce aviation ranged cycloalkanes and using the unconverted lignin and phenols to burn for the process heat and steam or gasify for the hydrogen source. Moreover, the energy and exergy analyses, as well as energy-quality improvement rate are performed to different cases based on the process simulation using Aspen Plus. Furthermore, the thermodynamic performances of the aqueous-phase conversion cases studied are compared with GFT."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Process description,"2.1 Process description Based on the technical route of aqueous-phase conversion of lignocellulose biomass to bio-jet fuel proposed by the Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, China [37,38], two processes for the conversion of the full components of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in biomass to aviation fuel-range hydrocarbons are configured. Fig. 1 shows the schemes of the two process configurations. The main conversion steps of biomass to bio-jet fuel in this technical route are as follows: the hydrolysis of three components (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) in biomass, aldol condensation to oxygenated precursors, and HDO as well as the residues and biomass combustion for steam and heat supply. First, a two-step hydrolysis of biomass is proceeded with sulfuric acid solution for the production of furfural and LA from hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively. Then, the oxygenated precursors are formed by aldol condensation of furfural and LA in the presence of a basic catalyst. Followed with the steps of low-temperature hydrogenation and high-temperature HDO, the oxygenated intermediates are converted to bio-jet fuel with C8–C15. As for lignin to bio-jet fuel, it is accomplished by a two-step process. Lignin is first depolymerized with methanol as the solvent over a noble metal catalyst under a H2 atmosphere, where a part of lignin is converted into C6–C9 monomers by breaking C–C and C–O–C bonds, as well as another part is converted into dimers by selectively breaking C–O–C bonds. Subsequently, monomers and dimers are converted into cycloalkanes via HDO for bio-jet fuel [41]. Finally, for Case 1, the unconverted lignin and phenols with the hydrolysis residuals of hemicellulose and cellulose are used to burn for the process heat and steam, and for Case 2, the unconverted lignin and phenols are used to gasify for the process hydrogen source. The gasification unit mainly consists of pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion processes based on the staged gasification technology proposed by Li [42,43]. Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) show the two cases, respectively. In order to compare the system performance of biomass to bio-jet fuel, in this study, the gasification of lignin for hydrogen without the conversion of lignin to bio-jet fuel is used as a reference case (Case R), as shown in Fig. 2 ."
3,Process simulation and calculation parameters,"2.2 Process simulation and calculation parameters In this study, as the feedstock, corn stalk (CS) is fed into the system under ambient conditions of 25 °C and 1 atm. Contents of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and others in CS are 33.2%, 30.4%, 18.3%, and 18.1% [22], respectively. Table 1 summarizes the proximate and ultimate analyses of CS and its components. Based on Aspen Plus 10.1 (Aspen Technology, Inc.), the processes are simulated to obtain mass flow, energy flow, and exergy flow. The models and operation parameters for reaction processes are listed in Table 2 . Biomass hydrolysis, Aldol condensation, and high-temperature HDO are simulated by RYield block. The stripping of furfural is simulated by a flash model (Flash 2). RGibbs block is used to simulate gasification and combustion, while RStoic block is used to simulate low-temperature hydrogenation, lignin hydrolysis, and lignin HDO. For the conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose components, the process simulation is based on our previous study [40] and literatures [37,38]. The conversion of lignin to jet fuel-range cycloalkanes by a two-step pathway is simulated based on the experimental study of Bosch [34] and Yan [33] in this study. The depolymerization of lignin to gas–liquid-solid three-phase production is simulated by RYield block, affording a small amount of CO and CH4 gases, undepolymerized solid residues (SSR2) modeled by an unconventional substance, and some phenolic monomers and dimers as liquids. In this study, C10H14O2 and C11H16O3 are chosen as the model compounds for monophenols; C19H24O7 is used as the model compound for dimer; and the remaining liquid products are represented by C7H10O2 according to elemental and mass balance. The HDO of the model compounds to achieve bio-jet fuel is simulated by RStoic block. The main assumptions for process simulations are summarized as follows. • The reactors are operated in the steady state. • The particle sizes of feedstock are assumed to be uniform without considering the difference. • The reactor temperature and pressure are considered to be uniform, and the pressure loss of the system is ignored. • Ash in biomass does not participate in any chemical reactions. Based on the current experimental data reported previously [22,33,34,37,38], the yield of furfural and LA can reach 59.5 mol% and 34.4 mol% based on hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively [37,38]. And for the two-step process of lignin to bio-jet fuel, the hydrolysis of lignin can be up to 37.5%∼67.1%, with the conversion of monomers and dimers to hydrocarbons is more than 90% [34–36]. Thus, considering the further improvement of current technology and our project target, we choose the calculation parameters as shown in Table 2."
4,Evaluation method and indicators,"2.3 Evaluation method and indicators 2.3.1 Evaluation method On the basis of mass and energy flows obtained from Aspen Plus simulation, the thermodynamic performance for the hydrothermal conversion of biomass to bio-jet fuel is investigated by energy and exergy analyses. Exergy analysis is carried out based on Szargut's exergy model [44], and is under a reference environment of 25 °C and 1 atm. The specific chemical exergy of the biomass feedstock and three components of CS are calculated by the correlation formula reported by Song et al [45]. 2.3.2 Evaluation indicators To evaluate and compare the energy and exergy efficiencies of biomass to bio-jet fuel production among the different cases, some indicators are defined as follows. • Energy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( η en , J e t ) The energy efficiency of bio-jet fuel is used to measure the conversion degree of the total input energy ( En input ) of the production system into the target product bio-jet fuel ( En Jet ) , as shown in Eq. (1). (1) η en , J e t = En Jet En input × 100 % where En Jet is the lower heat value (LHV) of bio-jet fuel; En input is the total input energy to the system per ton of bio-jet fuel, including biomass, hydrogen and electricity. • Energy efficiency of system ( η en , s ) The energy efficiency of system is defined as the ratio of total energy outputs of the products ( En p ) to the total energy inputs ( En input ), as written in Eq. (2). (2) η en , s = En p En input × 100 % where En p is the total energy of the product outputs per ton of bio-jet fuel, including bio-jet fuel and by-product steam. • Exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel ( η ex , J e t ) The exergy efficiency of bio-jet fuel is used to measure the ratio of the exergy output of bio-jet fuel product ( e x Jet ) to the total exergy inputs ( Ex input ) in the production stage, which is written as Eq. (3). (3) η ex , J e t = e x Jet Ex input × 100 % where ex Jet is the specific chemical exergy of bio-jet fuel; Ex input is the total exergy inputs to the system per ton of bio-jet fuel, including biomass, hydrogen and electricity. • Exergy efficiency of system ( η ex , s ) The exergy efficiency of system is defined as the ratio of total useful exergy outputs ( Ex p ) to the total exergy inputs ( Ex input ), as written in Eq. (4). (4) η ex , s = Ex p Ex input × 100 % where Ex p includes the chemical exergy of bio-jet fuel product and the physical exergy of by-product steam per ton of bio-jet fuel. • Internal exergy loss rate ( ξ ) The internal exergy loss rate is defined as the proportion of internal exergy loss ( I int ) to the total exergy loss ( I ), which is expressed as below. (5) ξ = I int I × 100 % where I is the sum of external exergy loss and internal exergy loss. • Energy-quality improvement rate ( ε ) The energy-quality improvement rate denotes the improvement of energy density from raw material to bio-jet fuel per mass of target product, as expressed below. (6) ε = ex p - ∑ m i · e x m , i Ex m × 100 % where ex p denotes the specific chemical exergy of the product; m i and ex m , i are the mass fraction and specific chemical exergy of the i th resource consumed in production process including biomass, natural gas, chemicals and electricity. Ex m is the chemical exergy of the resources relative to 1 kg of the product."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Simulation verification of lignin to bio-jet fuel,"3.1 Simulation verification of lignin to bio-jet fuel As mentioned above, C10H14O2 and C11H16O3 are chosen as the model compounds for monophenols, C19H24O7 is used as the model compound for dimer, and the remaining liquid products are represented by C7H10O2. To verify the model of lignin to bio-jet fuel by two-step process, we carried out the simulation tests, including the depolymerization of lignin into monophenol and dimer as well as the conversion of monophenol and dimer to bio-jet fuel. Table 3 indicates that the relative differences between experimental and simulation values are less than 1% and 7% for the conversions of lignin-to-phenols and phenols-to-bio-jet fuel, respectively. Thus, the simulation of lignin conversion to bio-jet fuel is acceptable and usable."
7,Carbon flow distribution of biomass to bio-jet fuel,"3.2 Carbon flow distribution of biomass to bio-jet fuel To investigate the proportion of carbon during the conversion of biomass to bio-jet fuel, the distributions of carbon flow in Case 1 and Case 2 are separately plotted as shown in Fig. 3 . The carbon content of cellulose accounts for 32.0% of the total biomass carbon, while that of hemicellulose, lignin, and other extracts account for 29.9%, 27.1%, and 11.1%, respectively. Through the aqueous-phase conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose, 20.2% of the total biomass carbon is converted to bio-jet fuel, accounting for 32.66% of the carbon in cellulose and hemicellulose. Conversion of lignin to cycloalkanes corresponds to 5.7% of the conversion of the total biomass carbon into bio-jet fuel, accounting for 21.14% of the carbon in lignin. These carbons sum up to 25.9% of the total biomass carbon that is converted to bio-jet fuel. In addition, the residual carbon of biomass (74.1%) for Case 1 is combusted for heat and steam. By comparison, another 15.9% carbon in biomass for Case 2 is subjected to gasification for hydrogen production (7.9% from cellulose and hemicellulose, and from other extracts and lignin both accounted for 4%), which is used for the HDO process of oxygenated precursors and phenols. The equivalent of carbon in the CS that is converted to bio-jet fuel occupies 41.8% because the produced hydrogen is also converted into bio-jet fuel. Therefore, a higher amount of carbon in Case 2 is used in the conversion of biomass to bio-jet fuel than that in Case 1, while the final burnt carbon content decreases, accounting for 58.2%. It implies that lignin to cycloalkanes with hydrogen of Case 2 is beneficial for conversion of carbon contained in biomass into bio-jet fuel."
8,Energy and exergy analyses of bio-jet fuel production,"3.3 Energy and exergy analyses of bio-jet fuel production Based on the simulation results, the energy flow and exergy flow of the two processes are plotted, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . The primary input of Case 1 is biomass resource, accounting for 83.9% and 78.8% of energy and exergy, respectively, followed by hydrogen input, with 11.8% and 9.8% of energy and exergy, respectively. Compared to Case 1, energy and exergy from biomass are higher (94.7% and 88%, respectively) in Case 2, due to no requirements of hydrogen input. Moreover, the use of chemicals and electricity is a relatively small proportion in both cases. Shown as Fig. 4, the highest energy losses of Case 1 and Case 2 occur in the furfural production unit, accounting for 19.5% and 19.1%, respectively. The secondary high energy losses come from the LA production unit, accounting for 10.3% and 10.0% of Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. Besides, the energy losses of Case 1 and Case 2 in the combustion unit occupy 10.4% and 6.1%, respectively, which also need be concerned. Fig. 5 shows the exergy losses. By contrast with energy losses, the highest exergy losses for Case 1 and Case 2 occur in the combustion unit (34.0% and 27.0%, respectively), which are greater than energy losses in the two cases due to the presence of several irreversible losses. The exergy losses derived from the furfural unit are second biggest component in total exergy loess for the two cases (14.4% and 13.9%, respectively). Moreover, the exergy losses resulted from the fermentation unit in the two cases account for 8.2% and 7.9%, respectively. However, the exergy losses of LA production unit are less than its energy losses, indicating that the losses are belonged to low quality energy. For Case 2, the conversion of lignin to hydrogen in the gasification unit causes some energy and exergy losses (6.8% and 9.3%, respectively), resulting in a lower system efficiency than that of Case 1. Furthermore, it is can be seen from Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 that the energy proportions of by-product steam in both Case 1 and Case 2 (17.6% and17.1%) are obviously higher than the exergy proportions (4.4% and 4.2%). This indicates that the energy quality of heat recovered by steam is low, although the amount of heat energy is large, which is agreement with the results obtained in literature [40]. Both cases exhibit a similar internal exergy loss rate ( ξ ), accounting for ∼ 78%, which is a primary loss. For each unit, the ξ of the combustion unit is 90% due to the irreversible loss of chemical reactions and heat exchange. The ξ of the furfural unit is 81%, corresponding to the heat loss from the steam stripping and concentration process. These exergy losses are difficult to be used because they belong to low-temperature heat energy. However, the external exergy losses of the fermentation unit in Case 1 and Case 2 are significant, accounting for roughly 72%, resulting from the unused residues. In addition, the external exergy loss rate of the HDO unit is considerable (∼58%), mainly due to a large amount of methanol consumed. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize the unused residues in the fermentation unit as much as possible to find a better way to utilize glucose and xylose. Furthermore, the improvement of methanol recovery in the HDO unit is another available way. The unit for the depolymerization of lignin to bio-jet fuel has a small percentage of both energy loss and exergy loss, and the amount of losses are relatively similar in both cases, with energy loss of ∼ 1% and exergy loss of ∼ 1.3%, respectively. Irrespective of Case 1 or Case 2, lignin can be used for bio-jet fuel production to increase the yield, and the energy losses of this process are small, indicating that it is a feasible technology pathway."
9,Performance comparison of three lignin utilization methods,"3.4 Performance comparison of three lignin utilization methods The thermodynamic performance for different cases is compared, including energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, energy-quality improvement rate, and yield. The consumption of biomass in the process can be divided into hydrolysis biomass for bio-jet fuel production and supplemental biomass burned for heat and steam used in the process. As shown in Fig. 6 , bio-jet fuel yields of Case 1 and Case 2 are about 0.13 t/t hydrolysis biomass (db), which is 30% higher than that of Case R (0.10 t/t hydrolysis biomass (db) due to having no lignin into bio-jet fuel in Case R. By the addition of supplemental biomass consumed for combustion, the bio-jet fuel yields for Case 1 and Case 2 are 0.11 t/t biomass (db) and 0.09 t/t biomass (db), respectively, indicating that a high amount of supplementary biomass is used for combustion in Case 2. Moreover, the bio-jet fuel yield for Case R is the lowest, which is only 0.08 t/t biomass (db). However, compared with Case 1, it can be seen that both Case 2 and Case R need to supplement more biomass because lignin is most fully utilized by bio-jet fuel and hydrogen in the two cases. Therefore, the heat required by the process needs to be provided with additional biomass in the self-supply of hydrogen case, which is agreement with the report by Crawford [39]. The energy efficiencies of bio-jet fuel in Case 1 and Case 2 reach 26% and 25.3%, respectively, while the exergy efficiencies of bio-jet fuel are 22.8% and 22.0%, respectively, shown as Fig. 7 . The gasification of lignin for hydrogen production in Case 2 causes a certain number of energy and exergy losses, resulting in a worse thermodynamic performance than that in Case 1. However, both Case 1 and Case 2 have visible advantages over Case R in the thermodynamic performances. It implies that the conversion of biomass in the proposed processes of lignin to bio-jet fuel is more efficient than the combustion of lignin with gasification of partial lignin for H2 production. Moreover, Case 1 exhibits the highest degree of the resource utilization for bio-jet fuel by aqueous-phase conversion according to both the η en , s and η ex , s . In terms of an indicator for the energy-quality improvement rate (see Fig. 8 ), the ε value of Case 2 (14.67%) is 49.4% and 19.1% higher than that of Case 1 (9.82%) and Case R (12.32%), respectively. And Case R is 25.5% higher than Case 1, indicating that the low-quality biomass energy upgrades the most in Case 2, followed by Case R. For Case 1, the hydrogen source supplied from the reforming of natural gas leads to the increase in the consumption of high-quality fossil fuel. Therefore, Case 2 can sufficiently utilize biomass for the production of aviation fuel from the conversion of lignin to bio-jet fuel and hydrogen. From these indicator values, conversion efficiencies of biomass to bio-jet fuel are relatively poor than those of other bio-jet fuel production pathways [15,46]. To obtain the maximum possible results of CS to bio-jet fuel via aqueous-phase conversion, in this study, a simulation was performed based on the ideal conversions and yields in each step reported from the literature [33,34]. The yields of furfural derived from hemicellulose, LA derived from cellulose, and phenols derived from lignin are assumed to be 61%, 40% and 65.3%, respectively. Correspondingly, the expected energy and exergy efficiencies of bio-jet fuel can be enhanced to 31.5% and 27.8%, respectively, as well as the values of η en , s and η ex , s can be increased to 43.3% and 30.8%, respectively."
10,Comparison of bio-jet fuel production from aqueous-phase conversion and FT synthesis,"3.5 Comparison of bio-jet fuel production from aqueous-phase conversion and FT synthesis To further clarify the thermodynamic performances of bio-jet fuel produced via aqueous-phase conversion of lignocellulose biomass, the process of bio-jet fuel production via GFT is employed to conduct comparison. Based on our previous studies [47,48], the process of GFT includes biomass gasification (BG), FT synthesis (FT), and hydrocracking (HC) units, as shown in Fig. 9 . As feedstock, corn stalk was first subjected to gasification on the basis of interconnected fluidized beds to produce syngas in the gasification unit. After the purification of syngas, FT synthesis reactions were performed to produce FT hydrocarbons. Then, the produced hydrocarbons were separated into jet fuel (C8–C15), gasoline (C5–C7), diesel (C16–C20), and wax (C21+) through evaporation and condensation according to the carbon chain range. To obtain a high amount of bio-jet fuel, the wax was further hydrocracked to light alkanes and then separated to the different hydrocarbon range fuels, including bio-jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, and unconverted wax by distillation. Moreover, the residual heat from the gasification unit was used to generate electricity. The yield of bio-jet fuel is 86.4 kg/t-bio from GFT and 107.7 kg/t-bio from the aqueous-phase conversion of Case 1, indicating that the aqueous-phase conversion of biomass can achieve a higher yield of bio-jet fuel (Table 4 ). However, the yield of the total fuel products is 171 kg/t-bio by GFT, which is greater than that in Case 1, indicating that FT synthesis can generate more liquid products, but the jet fuel-range hydrocarbon is limited. By contrast, the fuel products obtained from aqueous-phase conversion all belong to target jet fuel-range hydrocarbons, which can be straight chain hydrocarbons and cycloalkanes. This result implies that the aqueous-phase conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is a suitable pathway to produce bio-jet fuel. Based on the yields of the product obtained, the exergy analysis shows that the values of η ex , J e t and η ex , s are 22.78% and 49.8% by GFT, respectively, in comparison to the maximum values of 27.82% and 30.78% by Case 1, respectively. The system exergy efficiencies of the aqueous-phase conversion are lower than that of GFT, although a higher bio-jet fuel efficiency can be obtained due to an obvious increase in the target product from biomass. On the other hand, an electricity of 4533 kWh per ton of bio-jet fuel is generated using the residual heat from GFT, which is not only supplied for the power required by the system, but also the redundant electricity (1694 kWh) can be output as a by-product. However, the by-product steam obtained via the aqueous-phase conversion exhibits a lower energy-quality than the electricity produced by GFT. Thus, the residual heat from aqueous-phase conversion used to produce electricity may be a better way. The distributions of total exergy in the system and exergy loss are illustrated by the bar and pie charts, respectively, in Fig. 10 . The exergy loss includes two parts, i.e. external exergy loss ( I ext ) and internal exergy loss ( I int ) (as shown in the dash lines). It can be seen that the main exergy losses in the two cases are attributed to the internal exergy loss, accounting for 44.7% and 53.0% in GFT and Case 1, respectively. The pie charts were drawn to investigate the exergy loss distribution of each process in the two cases. For the GFT system, the exergy loss of the gasification unit accounts for 82.6% of the total exergy loss, which is the main source of the system exergy loss, while that of the hydrocracking unit is relatively small, only accounting for 3%. Moreover, the ξ of the gasification unit is 89.5% presented in literature [47] because high-temperature gasification leads to the significant change in the biomass macromolecule structure and subsequently results in irreversible losses. In contrast, the external exergy loss rate is relatively small, mainly resulting from the flue gas emission and the heat loss of gasification. For Case 1, the major exergy loss occurs in the combustion unit, accounting for 46.4% of the total exergy loss. This result is mainly related to the conversion of high-quality chemical energy to low-quality heat energy via biomass combustion, leading to considerable irreversible exergy losses. In addition, a great many chemicals consumed during aqueous-phase conversion also cause a considerable loss. It can be seen that the high-temperature combustion and gasification poses a disadvantage to the energy quality."
11,Conclusions,"The aqueous-phase conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bio-jet fuel with the different utilization methods for lignin were simulated, analyzed and compared. Some conclusions are drawn as follows. (1) The distributions of energy and exergy flows show that the highest energy loss occurs in the furfural unit, followed by the LA and combustion units, while the maximum exergy loss occurs in the combustion unit and the internal exergy loss accounts for a significant proportion. This indicates that the energy and exergy analyses have obvious difference for such processes. Moreover, the exergy analysis reveals that high temperature reaction in combustion unit causes the decrease in energy quality. (2) Case 2 involving the hydrolysis of lignin to bio-jet fuel combining gasification to hydrogen can achieve a self-supply of hydrogen in the system and increase the energy-quality improvement rate (14.67%) of biomass conversion. Additionally, the distributions of carbon flow indicate that Case 2 is beneficial for conversion of biogenic carbon into bio-jet fuel. (3) The values of η en , J e t in Case 1 and Case 2 reach 26% and 25.3%, respectively, while the values of η ex , J e t are 22.8% and 22.0%, respectively. For the efficiency of system, the values of η en , s in Case 1 and Case 2 achieve 43.5% and 42.5%, respectively, while the values of η ex , s are 27.2% and 26.3%, respectively. Compared to Case R, the thermodynamic performances of both Case 1 and Case 2 are better, indicating that biomass is more efficiently utilized by the conversion of lignin to bio-jet fuel than that by the combustion of lignin. (4) The hydrolysis of lignin to bio-jet fuel is beneficial to obtain a higher bio-jet fuel yield (up to 107.7 kg/t-bio), which is much higher than that of the process integrating the combustion of lignin (75.3 kg/t-bio). (5) Compared to the GFT case with the bio-jet fuel yield of 86.4 kg/t-bio, the aqueous-phase conversion can produce a higher yield. However, the conversion of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin to bio-jet fuel is not sufficiently high and more consumption of chemicals also leads to the lower systematic efficiency."
