0,Introduction,"Low rank coals (LRCs), which account for 50% of the coal deposits on the earth, are regarded as an abundant reserve [1]. The efficient and rationalutilizationofLRCs, especially lignite, is always a worldwide problem [2–4]. Thus, it is highly important to develop a technology to utilize LRCs effectively. As the core of cascade utilization of LRCs,lowtemperature pyrolysis is an effective way to obtain high value-added tar, char and gas under mild conditions [5–9]. During low temperature pyrolysis process, the content and existence form of hydrogen in the raw material directly determine the distribution and properties of pyrolysis products. But due to the low hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio of LRCs, appreciable amounts of radicals released from coal during pyrolysis cannot be sufficiently stabilized by low molecular weight radicals to form medium-molecules, which leading to low tar yield and poor tar quality [10]. Hydrogen should be supplied from other sources by introducing hydrogen-rich organic matters. Accordingly, co-pyrolysis are carried out to explore whether the hydrogen in relatively hydrogen-rich raw materials is beneficial to improve the quantity and/or quality of tar. The co-pyrolysis of coal and waste materials, such as biomass [11–13], tires [14], petroleum residue [15], coal liquefaction residue [16], plastic [17,18], model components [19], sewage sludge [20], is nowadays a hot issueto utilize waste materials and produce valuable products for industry at the same time. Although lots of literatures about co-pyrolysis have been reported, the majority of them just paid attention on the synergic effects on product yield, the establishment of kinetics to express the pyrolysis process, or the selection of experimental conditions for obtaining tars with higher yield or chars with higher gasification reactivity. In this paper, the co-pyrolysis process was investigated from the view of hydrogen transfer. The pyrolysis mechanism and product distribution are closely related to hydrogen transfer. It can be illustrated that hydrogen transfer mechanism is a main part of co-pyrolysis mechanism. It is desired that more hydrogen transfer into desired products and less hydrogen transfer into undesired products. Therefore, the investigation of co-pyrolysis product distribution and hydrogen transfer in this paper is helpful for better understanding the interaction mechanism between raw materials during co-pyrolysis. And no related works have been reported. Vacuum residue (VR), which is obtained from vacuum distillation of crude oil, accounts for approximately 30–50% of the feedstock [21]. With the continuously growing consumption of global energy, the demand for crude oil has greatly increased [22–26], and the amounts of VR are progressively increasing. However, the total treatment capacity of VR through various technologies and the utilization of these residues are limited because of their some disadvantages, such as low economic value, high viscosity and density, and high contents of impurities [27–29]. Therefore, the rational utilization of VR is becoming urgently important [30,31]. VR is with relatively high H/C ratio, it may interact with coal during co-pyrolysis [15,32–34]. Suelves and Moliner et al. [33,34] studied the co-pyrolysis of petroleum residue and bituminous / subbituminous coal. They reported that there exists significant synergies on the production of light olefins C1-C4 and BTX. Zhang et al. [15,32] studied the co-pyrolysis of petroleum residue and three kinds of lignite and compared the gasification reactivity of co-pyrolysis chars. Results showed that, no synergetic effect was observed on char yield during the co-pyrolysis process, but a significant synergetic effect was observed during the gasification reactions of the co-pyrolysis char. The char’s graphite degree increased compared with that of lignite char. In this paper, VR was introduced to co-pyrolyze with Xilinhaote lignite (XL) in an aluminum retort under atmospheric pressure. Firstly, the co-pyrolysis product distribution were investigated, then the hydrogen contents in each products were tested and calculated to study hydrogen transfer. These are helpful to better understand the interaction mechanism between XL and VR during co-pyrolysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and preparation,"2.1 Materials and preparation In this experiment, XL was obtained from Xilinhot coal mine, located in Xilinhot City, Inner Mongolia. VR was collected in Sinopec Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Co., LTD. The proximate and ultimate analyses of samples are presented in Table 1 . The ash content in XL is much higher than that in VR. The volatiles of VR is 99.69 wt% (on dry and ash-free basis, daf), and that of XL is 44.32 wt% (daf). O content in XL is much higher than VR. H contents in XL and VR were 4.16 wt% and 9.71 wt%, respectively, indicating that VR is a substance with relatively high H/C ratio. XL was pulverized to powder through a 80 mesh sieve, subsequently dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h and stored hermetically prior to experiments. And VR was cut into granule with 2 mm, subsequently stored hermetically prior to experiments. Tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4), deuterochloroform (CDCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and n-hexane (HEX) used in this study were analysis reagent."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The experiments were performed in an aluminum retort at atmospheric pressure with no carrier gas. About 15 g of XL, VR or XL/VR mixtures (with 4, 7, 10, 13 and 18 wt% (daf) VR) was put into aluminum retort. The heating program was as follows: rapidly heated from room temperature to 260 °C within 20 min, then heated to 550 °C in a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 20 min [35]. A conical bottle was put in ice water mixture to condense liquid product (tar and water), and a vacuum air bag was connected to collect gaseous product. After the completion of pyrolysis process, aluminum retort was took out and cooled down. The char was took out from aluminum retort and weighted to calculate the char yield (wt%, daf). The mass of liquid product was calculated by weight increment of the conical flask. The mass of pyrolysis water was calculated using the method in Chinese standard GB/T 480-2010, and the mass of tar was subsequently obtained by subtracting the mass of water from the mass of the liquid. Gas yield was calculated by difference. In order to investigate the structures and components of tars, another two more times of each pyrolysis experiment were done. Gas chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis were performed by dissolving liquid products into n-hexane. To avoid the addition of extra hydrogens, the individual and co-pyrolysis tars were collected in C2Cl4. Then the dissolutions were detected by 1H-NMR to deeply investigate the types of proton in tar. For convenience, XL(100-x)VRx (x = 4, 7, 10, 13 or 18) was used to donate the XL/VR mixtures with 4, 7, 10, 13 and 18 wt% VR, respectively. XL-nHS, VR-nHS and XL(100-x)VRx-nHS were used to donate the n-hexane solubles in tars of individual and co-pyrolysis, respectively. Each co-pyrolysis experiment was carried out at least three times in order to determine the variability of the results and to assess the experimental relative errors less than 3.00%."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis 2.3.1 Proximate and ultimate analyses The proximate analyses of raw materials were made according to Chinese standard GB/T 212-2008. The ultimate analyses of raw materials, chars and tars were conducted with elemental analyzer (Vario Micro Cube, Elementar Trading Shanghai Co., Ltd.). The combustion tube was set at 1150 °C, the reduction tube was set at 850 °C, and the TCD detector was set at 60 °C. The data were corrected by deducting the blank measurement and comparing with standard sample. The contents of C, H, N and S in the samples were obtained. 2.3.2 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a TG-DTA/DSC analyzer (Setaram instrumentation Co., Ltd). About 5 mg of sample was heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under N2 (60 mL/min). The residual mass and differential mass loss data were plotted with increasing temperature to express pyrolysis conversion and pyrolysis rate of samples, respectively. Thermogravimetric (TG) curves express the residual mass of samples at an instantaneous temperature. And the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves expressthe mass loss rate of samples at the corresponding temperature. 2.3.3 Gas chromatography analysis Concentrations of individual component in gaseous products during co-pyrolysis process were tested by a 9800 type gas chromatography (GC) (Shanghai Kechuang Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd.) equipped with a TDX-01 column (thermal conductivity detector, TCD, for detecting H2, CH4, CO, and CO2) and a Plot-Al2O3 column (flame ionization detector, FID, for detecting C2 to C4 hydrocarbons). 2.3.4 1Hydrogen-nuclear magnetic resonance Tars were analyzed by 1H NMR with a Bruker Avance Neo 600 MHz to investigate the proton types in tars. The test temperature was set to be 25 °C, spectral widths was 11.9 KHz, delay times was 6 s. 0.5 mL CDCl3 was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube. NMR spectra were studied using the MestReNova 9.0 software (Fig. 1 ). Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal chemical shift reference. The hydrogen protons were classified into HA, HO, Hα, Hβ and Hγ (see Fig. 2 ) based on the attribution of the chemical shift summarized by other researchers [36–38], and the corresponding chemical shifts are presented in Table 2 . The relative contents (RCs) of each hydrogen proton type to the total hydrogen proton were calculated by the integral calculations. And the total integral value of each spectrum was normalized to the corresponding value of the TMS area (chemical shift from −0.08 to 0.08 ppm). 2.3.5 Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer analysis Tars were analyzed with a GC/MS analyzer (Agilent 6890/5973N, Agilent Technologies, USA), which was equipped with a capillary column coated with HP-5MS (crosslink 5% PH ME siloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film thicknsess, helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, mass scanning range of 30–500 amu). The column was heated to 60 °C and held for 2 min, and then heated to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 10 min. The organic compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra to NIST05 and Wiley7n library data, and their RCs (the content of each peak area) were obtained by the methods of normalization of peak areas."
5,Calculation,"2.4 Calculation 2.4.1 Theoretical values To evaluate the interactions between XL and VR during co-pyrolysis, the experimental yields of tar, water, gas and char were compared with the theoretical values. Theoretical values were calculated using weighted average sum as shown in Eq. (1). (1) Y mix , i = x Y VR , i + 1 - x Y XL , i where i is a kind of pyrolysis product (tar, water, gas or char) or a kind of gaseous product (H2, CO, CH4, CO2 or C2-C4 hydrocarbon) or a kind of hydrogen (HA, HO, Hα, Hβ or Hγ); Ymix, i is the theoretical yield of i from the mixture pyrolysis; YXL, i and YVR, i are the yields of i from XL and VR, respectively; and x is the mass fraction of VR in the mixture. For convenience, theoretical values are denoted as T and experimental values are denoted as E. 2.4.2 Hydrogen content in each product The experimental hydrogen contents in product on product basis (HP-E) were measured or calculated, respectively. HP-E in char and tar were measured with elementary analyzer. HP-E in gas was obtained by calculating the total mass of hydrogen in hydrogen-containing compounds (detected in GC analysis), such as CH4, H2, C2H6. Since the constant percentage of hydrogen in H2O, HP-E in water was simply calculated according to the atomic mass ratio of H in H2O. The theoretical hydrogen contents in product on product basis (HP-T) were calculated using weighted average of the HP-E in each product from individual XL and VR pyrolysis. 2.4.3 Hydrogen balance and distribution in co-pyrolysis products Total hydrogen content in feed is calculated using weighted average of the hydrogen content of individual XL and VR (measured by ultimate analysis). The hydrogen contents in co-pyrolysis products on a daf feed basis (HF-E) are calculated by multiplying HP-E and each product yield, respectively. (2) H F j = H P j × Y j where j is a kind of pyrolysis product (tar, water, gas or char); HF is hydrogen amount in product (wt%, on a daf feed basis), HP is the hydrogen content in product (wt%, on a daf product basis); and Y is the yield of pyrolysis product (wt%, on a daf feed basis). The RCs of hydrogen in each pyrolysis product are calculated by dividing HF-E in each pyrolysis product to the calculated total hydrogen content (∑hydrogen)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Thermal behaviors of XL, VR and XL/VR mixtures","3.1 Thermal behaviors of XL, VR and XL/VR mixtures Fig. 3 depicts the mass loss and mass loss rate during individual pyrolysis of XL and VR. Both XL and VR exhibit single-step decomposition. At the initial stage (before 250 °C), the weight losses of individual XL and VR experience little change. The weight loss temperature range of VR is 275–510 °C, which is a little wider than that of XL (350–500 °C). The maximum weight loss rates of XL and VR correspond to almost the same temperature (418 and 428 °C, respectively), while their maximum weight loss rates are significantly different. The final weight loss of VR (78.86 wt%) is much higher than that of XL (24.23 wt%) at the end temperature of pyrolysis, which is in good agreement with the high volatiles of VR in Table 2. What’s more, XL may interact with VR at 350–500 °C since they both release amounts of free radicals in the overlapping temperature range. The product distributions from XL, XL and VR/VR mixtures pyrolysis in aluminum retort are plotted in Fig. 4 , together with the theoretical yields on the basis of an absence of synergistic effect (the dotted line). The product distributions of XL and VR are very different. XL pyrolysis produces mainly char (67.68 wt%) with moderate yield of gas (17.11 wt%) and low yield of water (9.40 wt%) and tar (5.81 wt%). Differently, in VR pyrolysis, the tar yield is high (68.74 wt%). Char and gas yields are 17.18 wt% and 11.70 wt%, respectively. And water yield is only 2.37 wt%. Similarly, in another report [39], a maximum liquid yield of 61.5 wt% was obtained to be at 460 °C at a residence time of 30 min, and the liquid yield of VR pyrolysis increased with an increase in temperature as well as with an increase in residence time. The obvious difference of product distributions from XL and VR pyrolysis should have great affinities to the structural difference of XL and VR. For co-pyrolysis of XL/VR mixtures, with the increase of VR ratio from 4% to 18%, tar yield greatly increases from 8.59 wt% to 16.38 wt%, and char yield is slightly decreased from 65.80 wt% to 60.60 wt%. The yields of water and gas are both decreased slightly. Fig. 4 also exhibits the comparison of experimental and theoretical yields of co-pyrolysis products. The difference ratios between experimental and theoretical char and tar yields are all within the experimental error range. That is to say, there is no synergetic effect on the co-pyrolysis char and tar yields. Differently, synergetic effects are observed on co-pyrolysis water and gas yields: the overall experimental water yields are lower than the theoretical ones (difference ratios between experimental and theoretical values are 1.95–7.35%), and the experimental gas yields are lower than theoretical values (difference ratios between experimental and theoretical values are 4.59–5.90%). The individual and co-pyrolysis tars are dissolved in n-HEX to obtain the content of nHS in tars (in Fig. 5 ). The content of nHS in tar from XL is 86.31 wt%, and that from VR is as high as 99.53 wt%. Comparing the experimental and theoretical relative content of XL93VR7-nHS and XL82VR18-nHS, the experimental values are both obviously higher than the theoretical ones, which illustrates that the quality of co-pyrolysis tars have been improved. Similarly, in the co-pyrolysis of Huainan coal and its distillation residue of the primary coal tar [40], nHS content in co-pyrolysis tar was higher than the corresponding calculated value, which was an obvious evidence of a significant synergistic effect on the improvement of pyrolysis tar quality by co-pyrolysis."
8,Hydrogen contents in products,"3.2 Hydrogen contents in products In Fig. 6 , the experimental and theoretical values of hydrogen contents in individual pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis products are exhibited. HP-E are plotted in columns and HP-T are plotted in pointplots. HP-E from individual pyrolysis of XL and VR are varied. HP-Es in char (3.10 wt%) and tar (8.56 wt%) from XL are comparable with HP-Es in char (3.37 wt%) and tar (10.34 wt%) from VR, respectively. While the difference between HP-Es in gas from XL and PR VR is significantly visible. HP-E in gas from XL is only 2.57 wt%, lower than that from VR (18.20 wt%). HP-Es in char from co-pyrolysis are in the range of 3.15 wt% to 3.27 wt%, which are slightly larger than HP-Ts (3.11–3.15 wt%). As to co-pyrolysis water, due to the constant content of hydrogen (H) in water (H2O), HF-Es in water are not shown in Fig. 6. HP-Es in tar (9.74–10.22 wt%) are overall obviously higher than expected (8.64–8.87 wt%), and the difference ratios between HP-Es and HP-Ts in tar are in the range of 9.05% to 15.46%. This also reflects the fact that the quality of co-pyrolysis tar has been improved, which is coincident with the higher content of nHS in co-pyrolysis tar than expected. Interactions between XL and VR may be speculated as follows. When the temperature is higher than softening point of VR, VR is melted and the coal particles are wrapped up [41], which makes the release resistance of coal volatiles increases and thus prolongs the contact time between free radical fragments from XL and VR. At the same time, due to the high H/C atom ratio of VR compared with XL, VR can provide more low molecule weight radicals (like hydrogen and methyl radicals etc.), which combine with free radical fragments generated by XL pyrolysis to form medium-molecular weight substances (i.e. tar) otherwise these free radical fragments from XL would polymerize to form char if coal was pyrolyzed alone. Moreover, there are some deviations between HP-Es and HP-Ts in gas. HP-Es in gas are lower than HP-Ts, and the difference ratio between HP-Es and HP-Ts can reach 4.47%. This difference demonstrates that some interactions between XL and VR have taken place, contents of hydrogen-containing compounds in gas may higher than theoretical values. The detailed gaseous composition will be investigated in the next section."
9,Analysis of gas and tar,"3.3 Analysis of gas and tar 3.3.1 Gaseous composition analysis via GC Fig. 7 displays the yields of each gaseous component. CO and CO2 are the main gaseous components from XL pyrolysis, and their yields are 13.03 wt% and 2.53 wt%, respectively. Differently, in gas from VR pyrolysis, C1-C4 hydrocarbons are the main gaseous components. CH4 yield is 3.58 wt%, the yield of C2-C4 hydrocarbons are as high as 7.30 wt%, CO and CO2 only account for 0.29 wt% and 0.46 wt%, respectively. These vast differences in gaseous component are the result of the chemical structure of feed. XL contains more carboxyl and ether bonds, while aliphatics and aromatics with alkyl side chain are dominated in VR. Fig. 7 also shows the experimental and theoretical yields of each gaseous product from XL/VR blends. Clearly, CO2 from co-pyrolysis is the main component, and their yields decrease from 12.04 wt% to 9.97 wt% with increasing of VR ratio. All CO2 yields from co-pyrolysis are lower than expected (10.81–12.50 wt%). CH4 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons are increased with the increase of VR ratio. The experimental CH4 yield is around 1.24–1.48 wt%, lower than the theoretical values (1.43–1.73 wt%). On the contrary, the experimental yields of C2-C4 hydrocarbons (1.11–1.61 wt%) are significantly higher than expected (0.44–1.40 wt%).As Li and Nelson reported [42], the main source of C1–C4 hydrocarbons is the thermal cracking of tar. In this study, the alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in XL intensify not only the cracking of tar from XL but also that from VR to produce C2-C4 hydrocarbons. 3.3.2 Analysis of proton types in tar via 1H NMR The individual and co-pyrolysis tars were detected by 1H NMR, and the RCs of each type of proton in tars (on the basis of total hydrogen amount in tar) are plotted in Fig. 8 . The experimental RCs (bar chart) and theoretical values (point plot) are compared. Fig. 8a shows the experimental and theoretical RCs of monoaromatic hydrogens (HAM) and polyaromatic hydrogens (HAP), and those of other kinds of protons are listed in Fig. 8b. Fig. 8a shows that the RCs of aromatic hydrogens (HA) are relatively lower than theoretical values. In XL-tar, HA accounts for 17.33%, in which the RC of HAM is 8.56% and that of HAP is 8.77%. And in VR-tar, the RC of HA is only 5.10%, in which the RC of HAM is only 2.06%, and that of HAP is only 3.04%, indicating that the main components of VR-tar is aliphatics and/or the aromatics with long side chain substituents. Fig. 8b shows that the RCs of Hβ are the highest in both VR-tar and XL-tar. In VR-tar, the RC of Hβ is up to 56.82%, the RCs of Hγ and Hα are moderate, and they accounts for 24.67% and 11.52%, respectively. In XL-tar, The RC of Hβ is 40.06%, lower than that in VR-tar. The RCs of Hα and Hγ are 25.89% and 14.17%, respectively. The RC of HO which linked to oxygen is very low, it is only 2.55% in XL-tar and 1.89% in VR-tar. With the increase of VR ratio in feedstocks (from 3 4 wt% to 18 wt%), the RC of total aromatic hydrogen decreases slowly and gradually from 11.80% to 8.61%, among which HAM decreases from 7.31% to 4.61% and HAP decreases from 4.49% to 4.00%. The RCs of HO and Hα decreased slowly with increasing of VR ratio. On the contrary, the RCs of Hβ and Hγ increase with increasing of VR ratio. Among them, Hβ exhibits the most obvious increase, which varies from 47.41% to 52.01%. In addition, the experimental and theoretical values of the RC of various types of proton are compared in Fig. 8. Results show that the experimental values of aromatic hydrogen are lower than the theoretical values, especially that of HAP. The experimental RC of phenolic hydrogen (HO) is slightly lower than the theoretical value. The experimental values of Hβ and Hγ are higher than the theoretical values, especially the experimental values of Hβ (6.64% to 9.01% higher than the theoretical values). While the experimental value of Hα is lower than expected, the difference increases from 5.75% to 7.80% with increasing of VR ratio in feedstocks. Above all, the lower RCs of Hα and HA (especially HAP) and the higher RCs of Hβ and Hγ (especially Hβ) confirm the hydrogen donation of VR and the improvement of tar quality again. 3.3.3 GC/MS analysis for nHS in tar The individual pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis tars (XL-tar, VR-tar and XL82VR18-tar) were dissolved in n-HEX to obtain n-HEX solubles (XL-nHS, VR-nHS and XL82VR18 -nHS). Then nHS were detected by GC/MS to determine their composition and therefore to evaluate the interactions that take place in the co-pyrolysis of XL and VR. In Fig. 9 , the components detected in nHS can be classified into aliphatics, monoaromatics, polyaromatics, phenols, other oxygen-containing components (OOCs, including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, ethers and furans) and others (nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds, et al.). The compounds in each group are minutely listed in Tables S1–S3. The components in XL-nHS and VR-nHS are very different. In XL-nHS, the main components are aliphatics (33.05%), followed by polyaromatics (29.53%) and phenols (22.49%). In VR-nHS, aliphatics are the most predominant, accounting for 86.91%. And the contents of other kinds of components are all extremely low (≤5.57%). These indicate that the vast majority of VR-nHS is aliphatics. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 8, the RCs of Hβ and Hγ in VR-tar are much higher than those in XL-tar, and the RCs of aromatic hydrogens (HAP and HAM) and HO in VR-tar are much lower than those in XL-tar. In XL82PR18-nHS-E, aliphatics are also predominant (67.88%). Phenols account for 12.91% and monoaromatics account for 8.43%. Comparing the compositions in XL82VR18-nHS-E and XL82VR18-nHS-T, it is obvious that the experimental aliphatics content (67.88%) is higher than expected (42.20%). This is coincident with the result in 1H-NMR where the RCs of Hβ and Hγ (especially Hβ) in XL82VR18-nHS are notably higher than expected. The experimental value of polyaromatics (4.76%) is significantly lower than the theoretical value (24.74%), and the experimental value of phenolic content (12.91%) is also lower than the theoretical value (18.67%). This is also coincident with the result in 1H-NMR where the RCs of HAP and HO in XL82VR18-nHS are lower than expected, respectively."
10,Hydrogen distribution and interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis process,"3.4 Hydrogen distribution and interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis process In this section, hydrogen distribution in pyrolysis products is calculated to investigate the hydrogen transfer route and interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis process. As Table 3 shows, the summation of hydrogen in all products is very close to hydrogen in feed (the relative error was below 3.80%), which showing a good accuracy of the co-pyrolysis experiments. The RCs of hydrogen in each pyrolysis product (on the basis of ∑hydrogen in Table 3) are listed in Fig. 10 . This figure displayed the hydrogen transfer from feed to products. The colorful bars stand for the experimental RCs of hydrogen in each pyrolysis product, and the black lines stand for the theoretical ones. The hydrogen distribution in products from XL and VR are obviously different. For XL, 51.45% of hydrogen transfers into char, 25.50% of hydrogen transfers into water, only 12.26% and 10.79% of hydrogen transfers into tar and gas, respectively. While for VR, 70.54% of hydrogen transfers into tar, 21.13% of hydrogen transfers into gas, and only 5.74% and 2.58% of hydrogen transfers into char and water, respectively. As for co-pyrolysis of XL/VR mixtures, char is most welcomed co-pyrolysis product by hydrogen, and gas is the least one. There are obvious changes in the RCs of hydrogen in char and tar with the increasing ratio of VR. The RC of hydrogen in char decreases from 46.42% to 38.16%, the RC of hydrogen in tar increases from 19.73% to 31.59%. The RC of hydrogen in water slightly decreases from 21.30% to 16.57%. With no evident change, the RC of hydrogen in gas varies from 12.55% to 13.68%. Comparing the experimental and theoretical RCs of hydrogen transferred into each product in Fig. 10, there are no obvious differences between experimental and theoretical RCs of hydrogen transferred into char and gas. Hydrogen transferred into water is less than expected, and hydrogen transferred into tar is more than expected. These show that the addition of VR is advantageous to let more hydrogen free radicals transfer into tar to make the obtained tar lighter."
11,Conclusions,"In XL pyrolysis, 51.45% of the hydrogen in feed transfers into char. Differently, in VR pyrolysis, 70.54% of the total hydrogen in feed transfers into tar. In of co-pyrolysis, more hydrogen transfer into tar and less hydrogen transfer into water than expected. The yields of co-pyrolysis tars are almostly equal to the theoretical values, while the relative contents of hydrogen tranferred into tar are 1.57–2.70% higher than expected and the contents of n-HEX solubles in co-pyrolysis tar are higher than expected. These obviously show that the quality of co-pyrolysis tars have been improved. Besides, n-HEX solubles in co-pyrolysis tar contains more aliphatic hydrogen and less aromatic hydrogen than expected. The relative contents of hydrogen tranferred into water are 1.59–2.26% lower than expected. As to gas, the contents of C2-C4 hydrocarbon in gaseous product are higher than expected. One reason is probably that low molecule weight radicals (like hydrogen and methyl radicals) from VR are combined with the free radicals from XL to form gas molecule. Another reason is that AAEMs in XL may lead to the catalytic cracking of tar to produce C2-C4 hydrocarbon."
