0,Introduction,"Hydrogen transfer reactions are mild methodologies for reduction of ketones and oxidation of alcohols in which a substrate-selective catalyst transfers hydrogen between the substrate and a hydrogen donor or acceptor, respectively. Furthermore, the donor (e.g. 2-propanol) and the acceptor (e.g. a ketone) are environmentally friendly and also easy to handle [1–3]. Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones has recently emerged as an alternative method to asymmetric hydrogenation for the production of chiral alcohols due to its operational simplicity and easy availability of reductants [4–6]. Chiral alcohols are very important building blocks and synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis and the pharmaceutical industry [7,8]. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis using chiral metal complexes as catalyst precursors offers an ideal method for reducing ketones to chiral alcohols [9,10]. For the past ten years, a developed efficient method is the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of ketones using chiral ruthenium(II), rhodium(I), iridium(I), or lanthanoid complexes as catalyst precursors and iso-PrOH/KOH or HCOOH/Et3N as hydride source [11,12]. In general, asymmetric hydrogenation is mediated by a complex bearing rhodium(I), ruthenium(II) or iridium(I), among which our focus has been ruthenium(II). One reason is that the ruthenium(II) catalysts have excellent performances [13,14]. Another reason is that Ru enjoyed a cost advantage relative to other asymmetric hydrogenation metals such as rhodium(I) [15]. Phosphine ligands have found wide-spread applications in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations [16,17]. Phosphinites provide different chemical, electronic and structural properties compared to phosphines. The metal–phosphorus bond is often stronger for phosphinites compared to the related phosphine due to the presence of electron-withdrawing P–OR group. In addition, the empty σ∗-orbital of the phosphinite P(OR)R2 is stabilized and it makes the phosphinite a better acceptor [18]. The most important advantage of chiral phosphinite ligands over the corresponding phosphine ligands is the easiness of preparation. From a practical standpoint, it is a substantial interest to develop highly effective chiral phosphinite ligands for asymmetric catalysis. The excellent catalytic performance of phosphinite based transition metal complexes [19,20] prompted us to develop new ruthenium(II) complexes with well-designed ligands. Recently, we reported the synthesis of new P,O-ligands [21,22] and their application in ruthenium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation reactions [23–25]. As an extension of the ongoing research program, we become interested in the synthesis of new unsymmetric ligands: (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((diphenylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldiphenylphosphinite, 1 and (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((dicyclohexylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldicyclohexylphosphinite, 2. This study was completed with a synthesis and full characterization of neutral p-cymene–ruthenium(II) complexes. Herein, we also report that ruthenium complexes of these phosphinites form efficient catalysts for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives with iso-PrOH under varying conditions."

2,"Synthesis of chiral ligands, 1 and 2 and their ruthenium(II) complexes","2.1 Synthesis of chiral ligands, 1 and 2 and their ruthenium(II) complexes Phosphinite ligands (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((diphenylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldiphenylphosphinite, 1 and (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((dicyclohexylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldicyclohexylphosphinite, 2 were synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1 . Ligands, 1 and 2 were synthesized by hydrogen abstraction from the described chiral (2R)-2-[benzyl(2-hyroxyethyl)amino]butan-1-ol, by a base (Et3N) and the subsequent reaction with two equivalents of chlorodiphenylphosphine or chlorodicyclohexylphosphine, respectively, in anhydrous toluene or CH2Cl2 and under inert argon atmosphere. The new ligands have been characterized by the 31P NMR spectroscopy. The 31P NMR spectra of 1 and 2 show no unexpected features. Two singlets are observed in the 31P NMR spectrum of each ligand due to the inequivalent phosphorus nuclei. The 31P NMR spectra of the free ligands consist of two singlets at 112.95 and 114.05 ppm for 1 and at 147.25 and 148.63 ppm for 2 [26,27], in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds, respectively (see Supplementary material, Fig. 1) [28–31]. Solution of the ligands in CDCl3, prepared under anaerobic condition, is unstable and decomposes gradually to give oxide and the hydrolysis product diphenylphosphinous acid, Ph2P(O)H [32]. Furthermore, the 31P NMR spectrum also displays formation of PPh2PPh2 and P(O)Ph2PPh2, as indicated by signals at about δ −15.6 ppm as singlet and δ 35.4 ppm and δ −21.6 ppm as doublets with 1 J (PP) 224 Hz, respectively [33]. Because of the compounds 1 and 2 are not stable enough in solution, the ruthenium(II) complexes 3 and 4 were synthesized in-situ. Reactions of [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 with phosphinite ligands (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((diphenylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldiphenylphosphinite, 1 and (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((dicyclohexylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldicyclohexylphosphinite, 2 are depicted in Scheme 1. The starting ruthenium(II) complex was [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2, which was prepared from the reaction of the commercially available α-phellandrene (5-isopropyl-2-methylcyclohexa-1,3-diene) with RuCl3 [34]. The reactions of [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 with one equivalent of 1 or 2 in toluene at room temperature gave the red compounds 3 and 4 in high conversions, respectively. The reactions between ruthenium(II) precursor and bis(phosphinite) ligands, 1 and 2 are not affected by the molar ratio of [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 as well as the steric and electronic properties of the donor phosphorus atoms. The initial color change, i.e., from clear orange to deep red, attributed to the dimer cleavage most probably by the bis(phosphinite) ligand [35]. μ-(2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((diphenylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldiphenylphosphinito-bis[dichloro(η6-p-isopropyltoluene)ruthenium(II)], 3 and μ-(2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((dicyclohexylphosphanyl) oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldicyclohexylphosphinito-bis[dichloro(η6-p-isopropyltoluene)ruthenium(II)], 4 were isolated as indicated by singlets in the 31P–{1H} NMR spectra at (δ) 110.87 and 113.48 ppm for 3 and at (δ) 144.25 and 144.78 ppm for 4, respectively in line with the values previously observed for similar compounds (see Supplementary material, Fig. 2) [36]. It is significant to remark that 31P–{1H} NMR signals of ligands and complexes do not differ significantly [37]. These complexes are highly soluble in CH2Cl2 and slightly in hexane and they can be crystallized from CH2Cl2/hexane solutions. The structure of the P-coordinated complexes 3 and 4 is supported by spectroscopic data (1H and 13C NMR). 1H NMR spectral data of complexes are consistent with the structures proposed. Analysis by 1H NMR reveals these compounds to be diamagnetic, exhibiting signals corresponding to the aromatic rings. 1H NMR spectra of complexes display signals of the η6-p-cymene ligand together with the resonances of the hydrogens of the P-coordinated ligands (for details see experimental section). The arene signals are well resolved, as found in previously reported mononuclear η6-p-cymene complexes [38]. In the 13C–{1H} NMR spectrum of compound 3, J (31P–13C) coupling constants of the carbons of the phenyl rings were observed, which are in agreement consistent with the literature values [39,40]. In the compound 3, the coupling between i-carbons and the phosphorus is relatively large, 1 J (PC) 51.0 Hz, while the coupling between o-carbon and the phosphorus relatively small 2 J (PC) 11.06. In addition, the most relevant signals of 13C–{1H} NMR spectra of complex 4 are those corresponding to cyclohexyl moieties. Carbon atoms of the cyclohexyl rings are observed as four signals at 26.35, 27.20, 27.78 and 43.21 ppm in complex 4 (for details see Experimental section). Furthermore, the structures of the 3 and 4 were further confirmed by IR spectroscopy and microanalysis, and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical values (for details see Experimental section)."
3,Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives,"2.2 Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone derivatives The excellent catalytic performance and the higher structural permutability of phosphinite based transition metal complexes [41,42] prompted us to develop new ruthenium(II) complexes with well-shaped ligands. We paid particular attention to arene ligands [43], because (i) the spectator ligands automatically occupy three adjacent coordination sites of ruthenium(II) in an octahedral coordination environment, leaving three facial sites for other functions, (ii) arene ligands that are relatively weak electron donors may provide a unique reactivity on the metallic center, and (iii) the substitution pattern on the ring is flexible. Complexes 3 and 4 were tested as catalysts in transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in an iso-PrOH solution. These complexes were then examined in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of the acetophenone to the corresponding alcohol by iso-PrOH/NaOH as a reducing system. Our purpose here is to compare the coordinating abilities of various functionalized phosphinites in ruthenium(II)–arene complexes in the catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. A comparison of complexes 3 and 4 as precatalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of acetophenone by 2-propanol in the presence of NaOH are summarized in Table 1 . These complexes catalyzed the reduction of acetophenone to corresponding alcohol ((R), (S)-1-phenylethanol) in the presence NaOH as a promoter (Scheme 2 ). At room temperature, transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone occurred very slowly [44] with low conversion (5% after 1 h, entries 1 and 2) in all the reactions. But, at 50 °C (Table 1, entries 3 and 4), this reaction occurred slowly with high conversion and enantioselectivity (up to 82% ee). During this period, the color changed from orange to deep red. In addition, the ee’s do not vary with the time, as indicated by the catalytic results collected with 3 and 4. Reduction of acetophenone into 1-phenylethanol could be achieved in high yield by increasing the temperature up to 82 °C. The negligible catalytic activity of [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 was observed under the applied experimental conditions [45]. It should be also pointed out that complexes 3 and 4 are more active catalysts than the corresponding precursor: [Ru(η6-p-cymene)(μ-Cl)Cl]2 (41% maximum yield in 24 h) [46]. When the temperature was increased to 82 °C smooth reduction of acetophenone into 1-phenylethanol occurred with conversion ranging from 66 to 51% after 30 min for 3 and 4. The catalytic activities of 3 and 4 are comparable, with the TOF values referred to 3 h of 22 h−1 and 17 h−1, respectively. These reactions were carried out under Ar atmosphere at 82 °C and reached the maximum conversion within 6 h for 3 and 9 h for 4, respectively (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). In these cases conversions higher than 30% have always been obtained (TOFs up to 25 h−1), indicating that the reactions start immediately after the addition of base without any induction time. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the catalytic system, 3 and 4 display the differences in reactivity. Examination of the results in Table 1 reveals that the reactions with the phosphinite–ruthenium(II), 4 catalytic system proceeded more slowly than those of the phosphinite–ruthenium(II), 3. But, the catalyst based on (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((dicyclohexylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyldicyclohexylphosphinite, 2 is slightly more enantioselective than the (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((diphenylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyl diphenylphosphinite, 1 counterpart, with ee values of 78% and 67%, respectively (entries 5 and 6). Furthermore, as can be inferred from the Table 1 (entries 7 and 8) the presence of base is not necessary to observe appreciable conversions. The choice of base, such as KOH and NaOH, had little influence on the conversion and enantioselectivity. The base facilitates the formation of ruthenium alkoxide by abstracting proton of the alcohol and subsequently alkoxide undergoes β-elimination to give ruthenium hydride, which is an active species in this reaction. This is the mechanism proposed by several workers on the studies of ruthenium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation reaction by metal hydride intermediates [47,48]. In addition, optimization studies of the catalytic reduction of acetophenone in iso-PrOH showed that good activity was obtained with a base/cat. ratio of >5:1. Although the conversions gradually decreased on increasing the mole ratios of [acetophenone]/[ruthenium(II)] from 100/1 to 500/1, the enantioselectivity was still high (Table 1, entries 9 and 10). That’s to say, the ee remained unchanged when the molar ratio of substrate to catalyst was increased. For the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone, the catalyst system showed good activity and high selectivity even in the presence of small amount of water (Table 1, Entries 11 and 12). When we increased the amount of water in the reaction system, the high conversion with the same enantioselectivity remained intact. Performing the reaction in air slowed down the reaction but did not affect enantioselectivity (66–75% ee, Table 1, Entries 13 and 14). Encouraged by the enantioselectivities obtained in these preliminary studies, we next extended our investigations to include asymmetric hydrogenation of substituted acetophenone derivatives. The results in Table 2 demonstrate that a range of acetophenone derivatives can be hydrogenated with good to high enantioselectivities. The catalytic reduction of acetophenone derivatives was all tested with the conditions optimized for acetophenone. Complexes 3 and 4 showed very high activity for the most of the ketones. The introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as F, Cl and Br to the p-position of the aryl ring of the ketone decreased the electron density of the CO bond so that the activity was improved giving rise to easier hydrogenation [49,50]. An electron-withdrawing group such as fluoro group to the p-position was helpful to obtain good conversion and good enantioselectivity (up to 80% ee, Table 2, Entry 1 and 2), while the introduction of an electron-donating substituents such as methoxy group to the p-position tended to lower enantioselectivity while maintaining satisfactory activity (Entries 9 and 10). The position and electronic property of the ring substituents also influenced hydrogenation results. The introduction of an electron-donating group such as methoxy group to the p-position decelerates the reaction, but that to the o-position increases the rate however improves the enantioselectivity (Table 2, Entries 7–10). Among all selected ketones, the best result was obtained in the reduction of o-methoxyacetophenone giving 87% ee (Entry 8). The results (Table 2) indicated that strong electron-withdrawing substituents, such as fluoro, chloro, were capable of higher conversion but with slightly lower enantiomeric purity. Conversely, the most electron-donating substituent (–OCH3) led to lower conversion with higher ee. Additionally, we further extended our study from acetophenone to other aryl alkyl ketones and the results are also summarized in Table 3 (entries 1–8). It was found that the activity is highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of the alkyl group [51]. When the size of alky group is increased, the activity was remarkable decreased [52,53]. However, enantioselectivity was not significantly influenced by increasing the bulkiness of the alkyl group."
4,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have developed efficient ruthenium(II) complexes of inexpensive and easy-to-prepare based on (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((diphenylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)}amino]butyl diphenylphosphinite, 1 and (2R)-2-[benzyl{(2-((dicyclohexylphosphanyl)oxy)ethyl)} amino]butyldicyclohexylphosphinite, 2 ligands. High conversion and moderate to good enantioselectivity were obtained in the catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the performance of these catalysts quite surprising, since conversions and enantioselectivities are not significantly affected in the absence of base. Amazingly, the conversion of the reaction was also not affected in the air or with the addition of water."
