0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of alcohol is an important transformation in organic synthesis and several methods are known for this particular conversion [1]. Aldehydes are important class of compounds used as food additives and in fragrances and as intermediates in organic syntheses such as Aldol, Micheal, Cannizaro and Perkins reactions. To achieve selective oxidations, various homogeneous catalysts, such as salts of Cr, Mn, Ru, Re, HNO3, CrO3 in H2SO4, pyridinium chlorochromate salts, some in combination with bases and TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl) as co catalysts have been reported in the literature [1–5]. Many of the processes call for large amounts of the catalyst materials leading to hefty toxic waste. In some cases additives have to be employed which must be disposed or can only be recycled with difficulty [6]. The use of heterogeneous catalysts in the liquid phase offers several advantages over homogeneous ones such as ease of recovery and recycling, atom utility, and enhanced stability in the oxidation of alcohols. In the literature, many heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed for oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. To mention a few, Kockritz et al. [7] reported Ru–TiO2 for oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with NaOCl or tertiarybutyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The presence of bases as additives leads to side products, which pose difficulty in their separation from the reaction mixture. Clay cop catalysts were used for oxidation of primary alcohols in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in microwave irradiation, yielding good conversions, but with less selectivity [8]. Zhao et al. [9] have reported oxidation of benzylic alcohols to benzoic acids with mesoporous modified catalysts in hydrogen peroxide under solvent free conditions and found poor selectivity towards aldehyde formation. Due to the acid formation, it is also a tedious procedure to isolate the product from the reaction medium. Uranyl immobilized on mesoporous catalysts [10] were used for oxidation of alcohols employing TBHP as oxidant, but the reaction was not controlled and yielded acids, which again becomes cumbersome to isolate the product from the reaction mixture. The oxidation of alcohols with Ti-Silicate [11] showed less selectivity to aldehydes. Oxidation of alcohols in TBHP, with copper bentonite catalysts was reported by Alizadeh et al. [12] which demands the preparation of catalysts incorporating organic ligands. Oxidation of p-nitrobenzyl alcohol with TBHP as oxidant and zeolites [13] requires longer reaction durations. Choudary et al. [14] reported that Ni–Al hydrotalcite showed good activity for the oxidation of allylic alcohols, ketones, substituted benzylic alcohols to benzaldehyde by O2. Similarly, Kawabata et al. [15] reported that Ni–Mg–Al hydrotalcite also showed catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with O2. Oxidation of alcohols with hydrotalcites catalysts in TBHP under solvent free conditions were also reported with good selectivity, but with low conversions [16]. This prompted us to investigate and design an oxidation route for conversion of alcohol to aldehyde or ketone with improved selectivity and conversion efficiency. In this communication, to explore the scope of selective oxidation of alcohols using peroxide as oxidant, the catalytic efficiencies of different loadings of Ni on silica and titania are investigated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All chemicals were synthesis grade reagents available from (Merck). Silica gel (Merck) particle size 63–200μm, 70–230mesh, pore size 100Å, BET surface area 480–540m2 g−1 was used."
3,Preparation of catalysts,2.2 Preparation of catalysts The catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method by taking nickel nitrate nonahydrate in distilled water and adding to it silica gel and stirring for 2h at room temperature and agitating at room temperature for overnight. The solvent is removed by drying the material at 100°C for 12h.
4,Typical oxidation procedure,"2.3 Typical oxidation procedure p-Nitrobenzyl alcohol (2mmol) and catalyst (0.4g) in acetonitirle (15ml) and 30% hydrogen peroxide (1ml) are mixed at room temperature and heated at 90°C under stirring conditions, for the required duration. Then, it was filtered and to the filtrate small amounts of MnO2 was added to decompose the unreacted H2O2. The treated reaction mixture was filtered to remove solid MnO2, and the products were extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated in vacuum to afford the p-nitrobenzaldehyde as a pale yellow solid, m.p. 105°C, 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3, 25°C, TMS): δ=8.1 (d, 3J (H,H)=8.3Hz, 2H, aryl-H), 8.4 (d, 3J(H,H)=8.3Hz, 2H, aryl-H), 10.2 (s, 1H, CHO); IR (KBr pellets)=1700cm-1 (sh,CO; MS (70eV) m/z (%): 151 (64) [M+ ], 150 (61) [M+ -H], 105 (20) [C7H5O+], 77 (93) [C6H5+], 51 (100) [C4H3+]. The reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. The product was characterized by 1H NMR (400MHz-Bruker) and IR spectroscopy. Based on comparison with the standard sample, the product was identified as p-nitrobenzaldehyde."
5,Results and discussion,"Among the industrial oxidants with the exception of oxygen, H2O2 is unique due to its only byproduct, H2O. H2O2 is increasingly becoming a preferred oxidant in the industrial processes. Consequently the production of H2O2 is expected to increase in the next few years. Therefore H2O2 is a viable alternative, as chemical companies face strict guidelines on environmental pollution. [16–17]. Using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant, the catalytic efficiencies of the materials with 5, 10 and 15% Ni loaded on silica or titania supports were investigated. All the experiments were conducted in duplicate. The conversion and selectivity efficiencies for the six investigated catalyst materials, on the oxidation of p-nitrobenzyl alcohol to p-nitrobenzaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide are summarised (Table 1 ). An examination of the results in the Table 1 indicate that using 30% H2O2 as oxidant, with 5 and 10% Ni loaded catalysts on titania, although the selectivity is good, conversions are poor even with long reaction times. With 15% Ni loaded titania, negligible reaction progress was observed even after 17h reaction duration. The weak activity of Ni–TiO2 for oxidation of p-nitrobenzyl alcohol to p-nitrobanzaldehyde could be possibly due the weaker metal to support interactions not well suited for catalysis. With commercial TiO2, the reaction gave 30% less conversions and these results confirm that Ni in association with SiO2 and TiO2 is the active species for the hydrogen peroxide initiated oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones. Kawabata et al. [15] during the oxidation of alcohols using molecular oxygen and Ni loaded on hydrotalcite support have observed that at the active sites, Ni(II) actions were probably coordinated by either Mg(II) or Al(III) through oxygen bonding in which Mg(II) as a base can donate electron to the Ni atoms through oxygen, whereas Al(III) as a Lewis acid can activate alcohols as alkoxide anions by the deprotonation. The catalyst inactivity with higher Ni is resulting from the orientation of the Ni spread on support surface and due to the uneven distribution of the metal on the support adjacent to the active sites on the support. Using 30% H2O2 and with 5% Ni silica catalyst, with reaction time, % conversion improved from 4% in 6h to 80% by 17h, with higher selectivity of 95% for later reaction. With the 10% Ni silica catalyst, reaction was even faster and the 6h reaction gave 38% conversion. With increased reaction time, both the conversion and selectivity percentages have improved. With 17h reaction, it gave 90% conversion and selectivity >95%. The increased reaction duration has positively contributed to higher conversion and selectivities. With 15% Ni on SiO2, negligible conversion was observed even after 17h of reaction time."
6,The characterization part is moved prior to discussion of catalysts,"3.1 The characterization part is moved prior to discussion of catalysts 3.1.1 Characterization of catalysts Ni silica catalysts were characterized by following techniques: XRD, BET, IR spectroscopy SEM methods. 3.1.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns The XRD studies on the 10% Ni silica were carried out on Phillips-PW 1830 Powder X-ray diffraction instrument. The XRD spectra showed the characteristic bands of the nickel phase and support, but no mixed nickel oxide support phases were identified. The pattern for the supports was that of crystallized materials with the well defined bands except for the amorphous structure, as only one broad peak around 2θ=25 appeared, which is characteristic of silica (Fig. 1 ). A perusal of the figure shows the silica dioxide peak gets broadened with increased Ni loading. Zhou et al. [18] too reported that when nickel is incorporated into SiO2, the sharp peak at 22° broadens corresponding to an amorphous silica matrix. 3.1.3 BET surface area analysis BET surface area analysis of 10% Ni/silica was carried using the Brunnauer–Emmett–Teller Equation. As higher catalytic activity was observed with 10% Ni/SiO2, surface area of only 10% Ni/SiO2 catalyst is estimated. The BET surface area of the catalysts is 180mg−1. During the impregnation stage of the preparation, surface hydroxyl groups of the silica where consumed by reaction with the active phase precursor. Such a surface reaction may have caused the decrease of available surface area of the support, probably by closure of the pores. 3.1.4 FT-IR spectra The results of both 10 and 15% Ni/SiO2 were similar hence only the 10% Ni/SiO2 result are discussed. The examination of IR spectra of 5 and 10% Ni loaded SiO2 using FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the band at 1100cm−1 (asymmetrical Si–O–Si) is very perceptive to formation of silicates [20]. The vibrational stretching frequency of the hydrogen atom in hydroxide catalysts 5 and 10% Ni/SiO2 appears at 3422cm−1. The vibrational stretching frequency of the hydrogen atom in hydroxide at wavenumber 3422cm−1 indicates that it has ordered cation distribution [14]. In the IR results of 5% Ni/SiO2, the strong and intense absorption band between 1078–1050cm−1, shows the presence of Si–O–Ni bonds [20]. 3.1.5 SEM characterization Morphology and location of metallic species on the surface of the catalyst were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL JSM-6100 microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). The images were taken with an emission current=100μA by a Tungsten (W) filament and an accelerator voltage=12kV (Fig. 2 ). The SEM figures of the 5 and 10% Ni loaded silica are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The morphology shows crystalline Ni of 2–4μm is well distributed over the silica surface. The Fig. 2c and d show the scans of the 15% Ni loaded silica, which indicates that the distribution of Ni on support is either in conglomerates or in layers, thus hindering the participation of both Ni and silica active sites in the reaction. SiO2 or Ni2+ individually had no catalytic effect on the reaction. The observed reactivity of Ni supported on silica material can be possibly attributed to the metal and support interactions, and the resultant changes in surface properties of the reactive sites. Earlier studies by Urbano et al. [19] have revealed that supported Ni catalysts prepared by Ni(NO3)2 by impregnation exhibit wide size distribution when compared with prepared by more controlled and deposition method precipitation route which generates low metallic Ni particles. The low metallic surface of nickel on the silica support encourages the nickel oxide crystallized formation. The presence of weak interaction between metal and support, due to little distribution of Ni entailing the formation of the layer of impregnated Ni, probably contribute to the increase of catalytic activity [20–21]. The observed non- reactivity with 15% Ni loaded material, could be possibly due to the multilayer of Ni loading on the support resulting in loss of activity as suggested by Choudary et al. [16]. This is also supported by the SEM figures of the different amounts of Ni loaded silica in the current study (Fig. 2). An examination of SEM figures show that Ni particles are well distributed in 5 and 10% Ni loaded material with fine particles and the 15% loaded material shows Ni multilayers (Fig 2c) and conglomeration of Ni particles (Fig. 2d) on the silica surface. Further, the broadened silica peak with the 15% Ni loading relative to lower Ni- loaded surfaces in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1) also supports the surface characteristics illustrated by SEM figures. Recently from the TEM characterization studies of Ni/SiO2 prepared from nickel nitrate, Houi et al. have reported activity of Ni on silica surface depended on the particle size of the metal and lower catalytic activity is observed with increased Ni particle size. Activity with 15% Ni loaded silica they observed that support surface is almost completely covered by Nickel particles, [22] suggesting that the Ni could be unevenly distributed which has contributed to the low activity of 15% Ni/SiO2. CO is widely used as probe molecule to detect the presence and the nature of lewis acidic sites as well as Bronsted sites (in the present case acidic hydroxyls), to which it may have H– bond. When the interaction between CO and absorbing sites has basically an electrostatic nature (as in the foregoing cases), a hypsochromic shift occurs with respect to the free CO molecule (2143cm−1). From their study of the surface acidity of Ni/SiO2 catalysts by means of FT-IR measurements of CO, Bonelli et al. reported the hydroxyl stretching mode (OH) 3800–3400cm−1 and that of the CO stretch mode (v(CO), 2250–2050cm−1 [23]. They observed that with increasing CO pressure, a negative band develops at 3744cm−1, whereas a broad adsorption forms centred at 3666cm−1 and with a shoulder at 3600cm−1. These features are due to H-bonding among CO molecules and OH species; those originally absorbing 3745cm−1 isolated silanols shift to 3666cm−1 as do silanols at the surface of dehydroxylated silicas indicating that the acidity of silanols is not altered by the presence of Ni species [24]. The plausible reaction pathway involves the initial conversion of alcohol to alkoxide on the silanol site (acidic site) and formation of nickel peroxide upon reaction of hydrogen peroxide with Ni. From the alkoxide on the catalyst surface transfers hydride to peroxide ensuing the aldehyde formation. The formation of nickel peroxide followed by the abstraction of proton from the alkoxide results in the formation of the carbonyl product. The proposed reaction pathway can be justified from IR spectral results from the current studies. The samples are outgassed at 723K in the OH stretch region (3800–3400cm−1), which also gives a spectrum of the commercial silica used as a support. In 10% Ni/SiO2 a prominent band present at about 3745cm−1 is due to isolated silanols invariably observed at the surface of the silica. With pure silica, a component is seen at 3742cm−1 assigned to isolated/geminal silanols groups. When Ni is present, the peak at 3742cm−1 decrease in intensity and disappears at higher Ni loading representing to the nominal monolayer coverage and only the band of free silanols is seen. The disappearance of the 3742cm−1 band is probably related to the slightly more acidic nature of the species, i.e. the free silanols group’s band present that have facilitated the hydrogen peroxide initiated oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde. In the preliminary experiments, the scope of different Ni loaded catalysts on the titania or silica supports for the selective oxidation of menthol and cyclohexanol were also investigated. As conversions were poor (10%), those reactions were not studied further. The suitability of 10% Ni loaded silica support catalyst for the controlled oxidative. The conversion of other alcohols in acetonitrile solvent was also investigated. The results are summarised in Table 2 . Benzhydrol was absolutely oxidized to benzophenone with 100% conversion in 17h. Cinnamyl alcohol was oxidized to cinnamaldehyde with 100% selectively, but with 20% conversion, with no affect on the double bond. Cinnamyl alcohol an allylic alcohol is also investigated in this study. Results in this study were found improved compared with cinnamyl alcohol oxidation using NiAl Htlc catalysts [14]. Menthol is oxidized to menthone with 100% selectivity and again only a 20% conversion could be achieved in 17h reaction duration. Instead of hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, when either molecular oxygen or air was bubbled through p-nitrobenzyl alcohol containing 10% Ni loaded silica, even after 17h there was no noticeable reaction. This shows that hydrogen peroxide initiated oxidation of benzylic alcohols with 10% Ni loaded silica in acetonitrile is ideal system for the selective transformation to aldehydes. These results categorically demonstrate that 10% Ni silica catalyst is ideally suited for selective hydrogen peroxide initiated oxidation of benzyl alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, with good conversion and high selectivity."
7,Conclusion,"With 90% conversion and >95% selectivity, the 10% Nickel on silica catalyst with 30% H2O2 as oxidant, proved excellent system for selective and controlled oxidation of p-nitrobenzyl alcohol to p-nitrobenzaldehyde. Cinnamyl alcohol is also selectively oxidized to cinnamaldehyde, but with 20% conversion. Benzhydrol can be converted to benzophenone with 100% conversion and selectivity. In conclusion, Ni supported silica works as an ideal catalyst for hydrogen peroxide initiated selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes under mild conditions with good selectivity."
