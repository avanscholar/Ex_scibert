0,Introduction,"Energy production from fossil fuels suffers from two main shortcomings: non-renewability and CO2 emission. To address these challenges, conversion of biomass into hydrogen alleviates the environmental impact of fossil fuels and enhances sustainable development [1]. Fuel cells are promising devices for clean and efficient generation of power for global energy needs [2], and the full environmental benefits of hydrogen fuel cells [3–8] are realized when hydrogen is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass. However, hydrogen production from biomass remains a challenge because processes such as gasification, steam reforming of bio-oils, and dark fermentation suffer from low efficiencies and/or complex processing requirements [9]. Considered as an effective means for renewable hydrogen production, steam reforming of biomass-derived light oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as methanol, ethanol and EG, has been studied as the on-board hydrogen feed for fuel cells [10–12]. Among these feedstocks, ethanol is most attractive since it can be produced in large quantities from biomass and offers several advantages related to natural availability, storage and safety in handing [13]. Moreover, ethanol is a particular model compound for reforming larger polyols that can be derived from biomass [14,15]. In the past several years, many interesting catalytic materials have been developed for hydrogen production from steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) [16–18]. Among these materials, supported Pt catalysts showed high selectivity to H2 [19,20]. Our previous study [21] indicated that transition metal oxide supports significantly affect the hydrogen production activity and coke formation over Pt-based catalysts during SRE. However, the reaction mechanism and detailed coke formation were not clear. In this study, a more systematic study on ethanol adsorption from the catalyst support perspective and the effect of Pt addition on the ethanol desorption behaviors are investigated. The detailed reaction pathway and coke formation mechanism are also elucidated in this study."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1. Catalyst preparation Pt noble metal, CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, and amorphous C were chosen as model systems. Activated carbon (Strem) and TiO2 (Degussa P25) were used as received. CeO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles were synthesized with the recipes mentioned elsewhere [22,23]. Pt supported catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation technique. Aqueous solution of tetraamineplatinum (II) nitrate (Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, Strem 99%) was added dropwise onto the supports until they were fully wet. Then the samples were dried in air at 100 °C for 12 h (heating ramp of 2 °C/min), followed by calcination at 260 °C for 3 h (heating ramp of 2 °C/min). Normally, high calcination temperature is required for catalyst preparation in order to create the interaction between supports and metals. Here, we chose to use a lower temperature for calcination to avoid Pt species sintering and maintain high dispersion. The calcination temperature was high enough to decompose Pt precursor for the catalyst preparation. The catalyst was reduced before activity test. During the reduction process, an interaction between support and metal was created. Because of the interaction, the Pt species was present in partially oxidative state after reduction in hydrogen, which was confirmed by the XANES profiles in our previous work [24]. For all of the samples, the nominal amount of Pt was 1 wt%. The samples were refereed as Pt/CeO2, Pt/TiO2, Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/C."
3,Characterization,"2.2. Characterization CO chemisorption: the synthesized materials were characterized by CO chemisorption. Irreversible CO uptake measurements were used to titrate the surface metal atoms and to provide an estimate of the active sites on the catalysts. CO chemisorption was measured in an AutoChem 2920 II (Micromeritics) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to measure CO consumption. Quartz U-tube was generally loaded with 100 mg sample, and the sample was pre-treated in 10 vol% H2/Ar at 350 °C for 1 h, then cooled to room temperature. To minimize or cancel the contribution of ceria support, CO chemisorption was carried out at 0 °C by soaking the quartz tube in an ice bath. The carrier gas was helium at a rate of 50 mL/min. BET surface area measurement: the specific surface area of the reduced sample was determined by N2 adsorption/desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using an AutoChem 2920 II. Adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature was performed using a 30% N2/He stream, and the desorption area obtained after rapid heating was compared with the area of a calibrated volume. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used for the surface area calculation and mean particle size of supports determination. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC): OSC measurements were conducted in an AutoChem 2920 II (Micromeritics). The samples were reduced in a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar at 350 °C for 1 h, then cooled down to 300 °C, and held at this temperature with pulse of 10 vol% O2/He mixture till the sample was saturated during OSC analysis. Oxygen consumption was calculated based on the signals from TCD detector. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD): ethanol or NH3 vapor was vaporized at 55 °C and 30 °C respectively, and dosed to the reduced samples at room temperature till the sample was saturated. After the saturated catalyst was flushed in helium at room temperature for half an hour, it was heated up to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in helium stream of 50 sccm/min. The desorbed species were detected using an on-line mass spectrometer (QMS 200, Stanford Research Systems). In the case of NH3, the on-line mass spectrometer was used to detect NH3 (e/m = 16, 17) and H2O (e/m = 18) in exhaust gas lines. In the case of ethanol, H2 (e/m = 2), H2O (e/m = 18), CO (e/m = 28), CO2 (e/m = 44), CH4 (e/m = 16), and C2H4 (e/m = 27) were detected in MS."
4,Catalytic tests and products analysis,"2.3. Catalytic tests and products analysis The SRE reactions were performed in a continuous fixed-bed reactor as shown in Figure 1 . The reactor consisted of a 40 cm long 316 stainless steel tube with 12.7 cm o.d. and 9.4 cm inner diameter. Catalyst was dispersed on quartz wool which was supported by SiC. A K-type thermocouple was placed at the upstream side of catalyst bed in a stainless steel thermowell (0.325 cm o.d.). N2 was used as a carrier gas and metered by a mass flow controller from Brooks (model: SLA5850) while premixed ethanol and water were introduced into the system by an HPLC liquid pump (Series I from Scientific Systems, Inc). All three components were mixed in a pre-heater which was controlled at 200 °C before going through the tubular reactor. Vapor products were cooled by a condenser and drained every hour for GC analysis while gas products went to an online GC directly with valve injections. Generally, 0.4 g catalyst was tested with a liquid feed of water premixed with ethanol (water/ethanol molar ratio = 3 : 1) at 300 °C. The detailed testing procedure and product analysis were mentioned elsewhere [21]. To further investigate the performance of Pt/CeO2, a less loading of catalyst (0.04 g) and different ratio of ethanol to water (10 wt% ethanol) were employed during the reactions."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization results,"3.1. Characterization results Table 1 summarizes the BET N2 physisorption, CO pulse chemisorption and O2 adsorption results, including surface area, mean particle size of the supports, metal dispersion, active particle size, and OSC. Both ceria and zirconia prepared in our lab were in nano-scale, with CeO2 of 13 nm and ZrO2 of 11 nm, respectively. The particle size of TiO2 was 28 nm and is relatively large, which contained about 30% rutile titania. Amorphous activated carbon had the highest surface area (637.6 m2/g) among the tested supports. However, the metal dispersions on all the supports were very similar to each other and around 40±5%. The Pt particle sizes calculated from the dispersions were around 2–3 nm for all the samples. OSC measurements confirmed the existence of oxygen vacancy and estimated the amount of oxygen vacancies in the samples. Pt/CeO2 consumed the highest oxygen during the analysis while Pt/TiO2 and Pt/ZrO2 showed a much less oxygen consumption. Pt/C had no oxygen storage capacity. The results indicated that the stronger the interaction between Pt and support, the higher the OSC is."
7,Ethanol-TPD,"3.2. Ethanol-TPD Ethanol-TPD experiments were used to investigate the hydrogen production temperatures and reaction mechanism. The detailed ethanol TPD results from pure supports and the catalyst with Pt nanoparticles are presented in Figures 2–5 . TPD profiles of adsorbed ethanol on CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts are presented in Figure 2. H2, CO, CH4, CO2, H2O, and C2H4 can be observed at around 320 °C. The formation of H2, CO, CH4 over different metals supported on CeO2 has been reported in several previous studies [24,25], which suggested that ethanol adsorbed as ethoxy species on the surface that can be decomposed to H2, CO, CH4 [26,27]. C2H4 is produced from the dehydration of adsorbed ethanol which produces H2O as well. CO2 at around 320 °C was possibly generated from water gas shift (WGS) reaction at low temperature since desorbed H2O was detected in the temperature range from 100 °C to 300 °C. H2, CO and CO2 desorbed at high temperature (650 °C) can be assigned to the products of decomposition of strongly bonded intermediate species (i.e., acetates species, acetaldehyde). A fraction of acetate species was the precursor that decomposed to CO2 [28]. Acetaldehyde decarbonylation produces CO and H2. Overall, the addition of Pt greatly promoted H2 production with a larger amount at lower temperatures compared with that over CeO2 support alone (from 310 °C to 156 °C, and from 540 °C to 376 °C). Furthermore, the formation of C2H4 was inhibited which was reported to be responsible for coke buildup during SRE reactions [29,30]. Moreover, Pt doping to CeO2 deceased the amount of strongly bonded intermediate species as less H2, CO and CO2 were formed between 600 °C and 800 °C. CO and CO2 desorption temperatures were even lower compared with those over CeO2, indicating that the intermediate species became more active by Pt addition. TPD profiles of adsorbed ethanol for ZrO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts are presented in Figure 3. The main desorption products over ZrO2 occurred at round 300 °C including H2, CO, H2O, CO2, CH4, and C2H4, which can be corresponded to the decomposition of ethoxy species, WGS reaction and dehydration of ethanol. Two desorption peaks in TPD profiles may suggest two types of adsorption sites with different adsorption strength. However, the penetration of adsorbates from surface region into subsurface region [31,32] or the presence of single sorption site with lateral interaction between adsorbate molecules [33,34] also gives more than one peak. Hence, CH4 desorption peak at around 550 °C can be assigned to strongly bonded CH4 in the subsurface of ZrO2 or lateral interaction between CH4 molecules. However, methanation reaction (Equation 1) was possible since considerable amount of H2O was observed in the same temperature range. Pt addition onto ZrO2 promoted H2 desorption significantly compared with that over ZrO2 alone (from 312 °C to 235 °C and from 550 °C to 419 °C with much larger amount). Furthermore, C2H4 desorption was suppressed as well as on Pt/CeO2. Overall, the decomposition of ethanol mainly occurred at 240 °C and 400 °C over Pt/ZrO2 catalyst, releasing H2, CO, H2O, CO2, and CH4 as products. (1) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O Decomposition of ethoxy species, dehydration of ethanol, and WGS reaction were observed over TiO2 catalyst at 230 °C as shown in Figure 4. In addition, H2 production at 440 °C and 600 °C can also be detected due to the stronger bonding. H2 production occurred at two temperatures of 272 °C and 436 °C with much larger amount. Both H2 desorption peaks were corresponded to the decomposition of ethoxy species and WGS reaction. H2 desorption did not occur over Pt/TiO2 at 600 °C possibly due to the methanation reaction from CO with strong bonded H2. CO desorption peak at 750 °C was possibly from the strong bonded CO on Pt particles. Traditional criterion of strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is the rapid reduction of CO or H2 adsorption capacity without significant metal particle size enlargement when the reduction temperature is higher than 300 °C [35]. As we reported earlier [21], the interaction between Pt and TiO2 was very weak (confirmed by TPR and XANES data). Thus, CO adsorbed on Pt particles over Pt/TiO2 very strongly and desorbed at 750 °C which was not observed on TiO2. In the same temperature range, other species were not detected over Pt/TiO2. Moreover, H2 desorption at low temperature was even higher compared with that from TiO2 (from 240 °C to 272 °C). It should be noticed that C2H4 desorption was detected at 268 °C possibly due to the weak interaction between Pt and TiO2, causing coke buildup eventually during SRE reaction. The ethanol adsorption on C was weak due to very limited amount of desorption species compared with other oxide supports as shown in Figure 5. Decomposition and dehydration of ethanol, and WGS reaction took place at around 140 °C, producing H2, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, and C2H4. Pt addition onto C led to H2 desorption at a higher temperature compared with C alone (from 140 °C to 160 °C). Meanwhile, H2 desorption at 284 °C and 512 °C and CO starting desorption from 550 °C were from Pt particles. This desorption behaviors also confirmed the weak interaction between Pt and C. The CO2 production at 600 °C was possibly from Boudouard reaction (Equation 2) with strongly bonded CO on Pt particles. (2) 2CO → CH 2 + coke Overall, H2 production activity from Pt/C was negligible compared with that from other metal oxide catalysts, indicating that Pt alone was not a good catalyst for the bio-alcohol reforming. Hence, neither Pt nor support alone can be the very good catalysts for the bio-alcohol reforming process. We observed that the hydrogen production temperatures were in the order of Pt/CeO2<Pt/ZrO2<Pt/TiO2<Pt/C, which followed exactly the same order of SMSI decrease. In the case of Pt/metal oxides, Pt addition increased H2 amount. However, when SMSI was strong in Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2, H2 production was lower compared with that from support, and C2H4 production was inhibited as well. When SMSI was weak in Pt/TiO2, H2 production was higher compared with that from TiO2, and C2H4 production was also available. In the cases of Pt/TiO2 and Pt/C, strong bonded CO was available from Pt particles due to the weak SMSI, and even Boudouard reaction occurred over Pt/C catalyst, causing coke formation in SRE reactions."
8,NH3-TPD,"3.3. NH3-TPD NH3-TPD methods are capable of providing qualitative information of the total acid strength. The strength of acid sites corresponds to the peak temperatures of the NH3 desorption peaks. Except that C had nearly a neutral property since there was only a weak peak observed at the temperature above 350 °C, each of the metal oxide supports had one big and clear NH3 desorption peak. But the acid amount followed the order of C<CeO2<TiO2<ZrO2, which followed the same sequence of C2H4 formation amount in ethanol-TPD (Figures 2–5). The small peak on C indicates NH3 mainly interacted with the catalyst supports instead of Pt. A shift of the NH3 desorption peaks to a lower temperature, compared with their corresponding supports, over all supported Pt catalysts [21] was observed as shown in in Figure 6 . The interaction between Pt and supports was possibly connected to a weakened interaction between NH3 and supports. The acid strength followed the sequence: Pt/CeO2<Pt/ZrO2<Pt/TiO2. Thus, the acid sites were mainly determined by supports, but Pt weakened the interaction between NH3 and supports. The C2H4 desorption amount over supported Pt catalysts did not follow their acid amount sequence or strength order since Pt addition changed ethanol desorption behaviors. However, C2H4 was not observed when SMSI was strong in the cases of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2, while C2H4 was found when SMSI was weak in Pt/TiO2."
9,Catalytic activity and stability,"3.4. Catalytic activity and stability The catalysts were tested for their activity and stability at 350 °C under atmosphere pressure for 5 h with a steam/ethanol ratio of 3/1 and a loading weight of 0.4 g. Pt/CeO2 was further tested with 10 wt% ethanol/water and a loading weight of 0.04 g. The conversion of ethanol as a function of time obtained over the catalysts is shown in Figure 7 . The activity order followed the sequence of Pt/CeO2>Pt/ZrO2>Pt/TiO2∼Pt/C. The sequence was nearly exactly the same as the order of the Pt-support interaction, or the oxygen vacancy amounts in the supports. Much less conversion of 23% was achieved when much small amount of Pt/CeO2 (0.04 g) was used. Pt/CeO2 employed in SRE with 10 wt% ethanol in H2O showed almost 100% conversion since higher water/ethanol ratio favored the WGS reaction. However, H2 and carbon species production decreased since 1 mole ethanol has more H and C atoms than 1 mole water (Figure 8 ). After activity tests, we conducted TPO measurements for all the samples and the CO2 evolution curves are shown in Figure 9 . No obvious CO2 evolution peak was observed over Pt/CeO2 catalyst, indicating that there was no stable coke formation on this catalyst surface after the reaction with different water/ethanol ratios in the feed or even with the catalyst loading of 0.04 g. However, both Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/TiO2 samples had big and distinct CO2 evolution peaks. These CO2 desorption peaks could be assigned to active carbon species which were different from graphite-like carbon species. However, the activity of these carbon species was different."
10,SRE pathway and coke formation mechanisms,"3.5. SRE pathway and coke formation mechanisms The product distributions from GC analysis are presented in Figure 8. The liquid products were sampled hourly during the reaction and analyzed by HPGC with FID detector. The gas products were analyzed continuously by the on-line HPGC with TCD detector, which gives the real time compositions. The data of Figure 8 was derived from both the gas and liquid products after the reaction became stable over Pt/CeO2. The reaction intermediates like acetone and acetaldehyde, H2, CO, and CH4 were observed during SRE reactions over Pt supported catalysts. Based on the products, dehydrogenation (Equation 3), decarbonylation of acetaldehyde (Equations 4 and 5), methanation reaction (Equation 1), and decomposition (Equation 6) reactions were believed to be the major reactions in our study. (3) C 2 H 5 OH → CH 3 CHO + H 2 (4) CH 3 CHO → CH 4 + CO (5) 2CH 3 CHO → CH 3 COCH + CO + H 2 (6) (6) C 2 H 5 OH → CH 4 + H 2 + CO (7) CH 4 → polymers → coke (8) CH 3 CHO → coke (9) CH 3 COCH 3 → oligomers → coke (10) CH 4 → coke + H 2 (11) CH + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 (12) CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + H 2 As reported in literature [36,37], H2 production from SRE is mainly from the dehydrogenation of ethanol (Equation 3), decomposition of ethanol (Equation 6), WGS reaction of CO (Equation 11), and the steam reforming of methane (Equation 12), while coke formation is primarily from reactions (Equations 2,7,9) [27,38]. Under our reaction conditions, H2 production was mainly from the dehydrogenation and decomposition of ethanol, and the decarbonylation of acetaldehyde. Contribution to H2 production from WGS reactions and methane steam reforming was limited due to the trace of CO2 formed and a low reaction temperature (300 °C). Considering the largest amount of acetone formation over Pt/CeO2, it is believed that the decarbonylation of acetaldehyde (Equation 5) had more contribution to H2 formation than other two catalysts. Comparative amount of acetaldehyde formation over all three Pt-based catalysts and acetone formation amount of acetone deceased in the order: Pt/CeO2>Pt/ZrO2>Pt/TiO2, indicating that coke formation from acetone (Equation 9) was easier over Pt/TiO2 and Pt/ZrO2 catalysts. A proof point to support this observation was that CH4 and CO formation over Pt/TiO2 was very less compared with that over Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/CeO2. Acetaldehyde underwent decomposition preferably through reaction (Equation 9) followed by coke formation instead of reaction (Equation 4) over Pt/TiO2 catalyst. The main reason for such selectivity over Pt/TiO2 was because that CO formed in reaction (Equation 4) strongly adsorbed on Pt particles due to weak SMSI and desorbed at very high temperature as indicated by ethanol-TPD. These strong bonded CO could further underwent Boudouard reaction (Equation 2) to form coke and CO2. However, only a trace amount of CO2 was observed during SRE. As reported by Stagg-Williams et al. [39], oxygen vacancies of metal oxide supports can be replenished by CO2, releasing CO as a product. Coke formation from C2H4 by ethanol dehydration was common over metal supported catalysts [29,30]. It is believed that coke formation from C2H4 over Pt/TiO2 and Pt/ZrO2 was likely though C2H4 was not detected in gas products. The amount of coke from Pt/TiO2 was estimated to be more than that over Pt/ZrO2 due to the stronger acidity in Pt/TiO2, as confirmed by ethanol-TPD. C2H4 was found on Pt/TiO2. The reason why Pt/CeO2 had no coke formation even with Pt loading as low as 0.04 g was due to strong SMSI which allowed high oxygen vacancies (505 μmol O/g) formation during H2 reduction, and greatly promoted coke gasification [40–42]. As discussed above, the activity in SRE followed the strength of interaction between Pt and supports. SMSI led to a lower hydrogen production temperature and a higher activity. Moreover, a stronger interaction between Pt and supports resulted in less or no C2H4 formation while weak interaction caused C2H4 generation and strong CO adsorption during ethanol-TPD. Based on the ethanol-TPD data and product distributions, the H2 production pathway was similar over Pt supported metal oxide catalysts as proposed in Figure 10 . Hydrogen was mainly produced by the decomposition and dehydrogenation of ethanol, and the decarbonylation of acetaldehyde. Coke was formed over Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts, with four peaks at 264 °C, 312 °C, 360 °C and 397 °C, which could be assigned to coke from acetaldehyde, acetone, C2H4 and CO, respectively. The reason why Pt/CeO2 had no coke formation during SRE even with low Pt loading weight was due to very high oxygen storage capacity caused by SMSI. Overall, the results in this work demonstrates that the synergistic interaction between Pt and transition metal oxide supports plays an important role in hydrogen production activity and coke formation."
11,Conclusions,"SMSI has significant effect on ethanol desorption behaviors over Pt/metal oxide catalysts. Strong interaction between Pt and supports leads to H2 production at lower temperatures and no C2H4 formation, while weak interaction causes C2H4 formation and strong bonded CO on Pt particles during ethanol-TPD. H2 production over Pt-based catalysts is mainly produced by the decomposition and dehydrogenation of ethanol, and the decarbonylation of acetaldehyde. Coke formation can be formed from acetaldehyde, acetone, C2H4 and CO. However, when the interaction is weak, coke is easily generated from acetone, C2H4 and CO. When the interaction is strong, no coke formation is observed due to high oxygen storage capacity. The results obtained in this work provide insights into the development of novel catalytic materials for hydrogen production without coke formation."
