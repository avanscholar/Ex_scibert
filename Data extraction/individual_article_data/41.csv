0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation products are an important class of chemicals often produced industrially in batch systems using pressurised (5–100 bar) non-renewable H2 [1]. Coupling catalytic dehydrogenation with hydrogenation involves in situ hydrogen generation, transfer and utilisation [2]. It can be considered as a promising alternative that circumvents the requirement for external H2 with the possible generation of two high value products. However, catalytic coupling processes have only been demonstrated for a limited number of molecular combinations to date, most notably the coupled reduction of aldehydes/ketones (e.g. furfural [3], acetophenone [4]) with dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols (e.g. 2-butanol, 2-propanol [5]). We are not aware of any report in the literature that involves -C≡C- bond transformation in tandem dehydrogenation-hydrogenation, the focus of this work. Two active sites are required for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in the coupled system. Several catalysts have now been employed, primarily noble multi-metallic systems including bimetallic (e.g. Co-Ru [5] and Au-Cu [6]) and alloy catalysts (e.g. NiRuPtAu [7] and PdCu [3]). The use of a non-noble monometallic catalyst is an attractive consideration in the development of an effective catalyst, given the associated straightforward synthesis and low cost. However, there is a requirement for a bifunctional behaviour where the same metal promotes both steps. The metal oxidation state can control catalytic response [8]. Indeed, while metallic Au and Ag promote hydrogenation (e.g. nitroarenes [9,10]), the electron deficient counterparts (Auδ+ and Ag+) have been deemed active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols (e.g. benzyl alcohols, ethanol [11,12]). The use of monometallic catalysts in coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation is quite limited. Nevertheless, Jae et al. [13] examined the liquid phase coupled 2-propanol/5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural reaction over Ru/C and identified Ru0 and Ru4+ as the active species for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation, respectively. In a recent study, Reddy and co-workers [14] investigated the tandem 2-propanol/hydrocinnamaldehyde process using a series of oxide (SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and ZrO2) supported Cu catalysts and attributed the differences in catalytic response to variations in copper dispersion and acid-base properties of the support. Copper promotes -C≡C- bond hydrogenation [15] and alcohol dehydrogenation [16]. The active form of copper in alkyne hydrogenation still remains unknown and there is no general consensus regarding the copper oxidation state responsible for catalytic activity in alcohol dehydrogenation, i.e. Cu+ [17] and/or Cu0 [18] have been identified as the active species. The ultimate copper oxidation state is determined by the Cu precursor [19], synthesis method [19], activation conditions [20] and nature of the carrier [19]. It is difficult to establish an explicit link between dehydrogenation/hydrogenation response and Cu oxidation state from the available literature. Herein, we have considered the continuous production of styrene, a precursor of polystyrene with an annual worldwide production of 1 million tonnes per year [21], via hydrogenation of phenylacetylene coupled with benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation to benzaldehyde, an important intermediate in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [22] (Fig. 1 ). The target styrene and benzaldehyde products can be readily separated by liquid–liquid extraction [23]. The industrial manufacturing of styrene by catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over Fe-K-Cr oxide-based catalysts is inefficient due to (i) the multi-step nature of the process, (ii) catalyst deactivation and (iii) formation of propylene oxide as a by-product [24]. Gas phase catalytic hydrogenation of phenylacetylene has emerged as a viable alternative with a lower associated cost but over-hydrogenation (to ethylbenzene) is difficult to fully circumvent, notably at conversions > 80% [25]. Commercial benzaldehyde production can involve hydrolysis of benzyl chloride or oxidation of benzyl alcohol using (toxic) chromium and manganese salts with production of hazardous waste [22]. Gas phase dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol in N2 at P = 1 atm offers clear economic and environmental advantages [22], but an exhaustive search through the literature unearthed only two studies using MgO [22] and hydrotalcite [26] supported copper catalysts, where toluene was formed as a by-product. We provide in this work the first direct correlation between dehydrogenation-hydrogenation response and Cu oxidation state in the gas phase benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation coupled with phenylacetylene hydrogenation over a series of Cu/CeO2 catalysts. We demonstrate that product distribution can be tuned by changing the Cu oxidation state and switching from the stand-alone (independent dehydrogenation and hydrogenation) to the coupled process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation and activation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and activation The CeO2 support and bulk CuO (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) were used as received. Five CeO2 supported (1 and 15% wt.) Cu catalysts were synthesised by deposition–precipitation or standard impregnation and activated in flowing hydrogen (60 cm3 min−1, 2 K min−1 to 573–773 K; BOC, >99.99%). The metal content, preparation method and final temperature during hydrogen thermal treatment were selected in order to generate a series of catalysts with different Cu+/Cu0 molar ratio. The samples synthesised by deposition–precipitation or impregnation are denoted in this paper by the prefix “DP” and “IM”, respectively, followed by the Cu content (1 or 15% wt.) with the associated activation temperature (573 or 773 K) specified in parentheses. DP1(573), DP15(573) and DP15(773) were synthesised (at 353 K) by drop wise addition of a sodium hydroxide solution (2 M, Fisher Scientific, ≥97%) to a suspension containing the CeO2 carrier (3 g) and the metal precursor (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 40–600 cm3, 1 × 10−2 M, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), kept under constant (650 rpm) agitation until pH = 10. The system was aged (353 K, 650 rpm, 4 h) to guarantee homogeneous deposition of Cu2+ species. The precipitate was extracted by filtration, washed (distilled water until pH = 7) and dried (45 cm3 min−1 N2, 393 K, ca. 12 h, BOC, >99.99%). IM1(773) and IM15(773) synthesis was based on standard impregnation with aqueous CuCl2 (35–525 cm3, 2 × 10−2 M, 4 g of CeO2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%), where the slurry was heated (353 K, 650 rpm) until total evaporation; drying step as above. The catalyst precursors were sieved (75 μm, ATM fine test sieve), activated in H2 (step as above) and passivated at room temperature (60 cm3 min−1 1% v/v O2/N2) for ex situ characterisation."
3,Catalyst characterisation,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation The copper content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS, Shimadzu AA-6650 spectrometer, air-acetylene flame) from the extract in 25% v/v HNO3/HCl. Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR)/ desorption (H2-TPD) and hydrogen chemisorption analysis (at 498 K) were carried out in the commercial CHEM-BET 3000 unit (Quantachrome Instrument, detector = TCD, software = TPR WinTM). H2-TPR (17 cm3 min−1, 5% v/v H2/N2, 2 K min−1 to 573–773 K) was employed to determine the extent of Cu and CeO2 reduction, and the amount of surface chlorine [19], i.e. profile curve fitting (software = CasaXPS 2.3.17) serves to quantify the amount of hydrogen consumed during each transition step (α = Cu2+ → Cu+, β = Cu+ → Cu0, γ = Ce4+→ Ce3+ and δ = 2Cl*→ 2HCl; Cl* indicates adsorbed chlorine on the catalyst surface) and extract the concentration of copper species (denoted Cu TPR 2 + , Cu TPR + and Cu TPR 0 ), Ce3+ ( Ce TPR 3 + ) and adsorbed chlorine ( Cl TPR ∗ ). Post H2-TPR, physisorbed hydrogen was removed by treatment in flowing N2 (65 cm3 min−1, 1.5 h) at the final activation temperature. Hydrogen consumption during activation was corrected using H2-TPD (50 cm3 min−1, N2, 50 K min−1 to 1073 K for 1 h; the profiles for the four Cu/CeO2 catalysts are included in Fig. S.1 of the Supplementary Information) recorded in parallel directly after TPR to explicitly determine hydrogen utilised in the reduction of ceria. The samples were then cooled to room temperature and underwent hydrogen chemisorption by pulse (10–20 μl) titration. H2 uptake reproducibility was better than ±5% and the values quoted in this work are the mean; there was no detectable hydrogen uptake on the ceria support alone. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Scienta ESCA 300 spectrometer using a monochromatic Al anode (Kα 1486.6 eV, 10 kV, 20 mA). Before analysis, the Cu/CeO2 catalysts were activated in situ in a pre-chamber under H2 atmosphere (base pressure = 10−8 mbar, H2 partial pressure = 10−6 mbar; 2 K min−1 to 573–773 K) and subsequently subjected to ultra-high vacuum conditions (ca. 10−8 mbar). Full range survey (0–1100 eV) and high-resolution spectra (over the Cu 2p, Ce 3d core levels and Cu LMM Auger region) were collected; analyser pass energy = 150 eV. The Ce 3d uꞌꞌꞌ peak was calibrated at binding energy (B.E.) = 917 eV and used as an internal standard to compensate for charging effects [27]. Spectral curve fitting and quantification used the CasaXPS software, employing relative sensitivity factors provided by Scienta. The distribution of Cu and Ce oxidation states was also derived from XPS curve fitting by fixing the B.E. for each Cu species (Cu0 and Cu+ (Cu 2p 3/2 B.E. ≤ 933 eV) and Cu2+ (>933 eV)) and Ce peaks (uꞌꞌꞌ peak B.E. = 917 eV with the 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 peaks separated by −18.3 ± 0.3 eV) according to reported literature [27,28], using the Gaussian-Lorentzian curves after subtracting a Shirley background with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) fixed at 2.6–3.6 eV over Cu 2p 3/2 [29] and 2.6–4.9 eV over Ce 3d [30] regions. The concentration of Cu in different oxidation states derived from XPS data fit was compared with that determined according to the method described by Jasieniak and Gerson as reported in [31], i.e. (1) Cu XPS 2 + ( % ) = B 1 + A S / B S A + B × 100 (2) Cu XPS 0 + Cu XPS + ( % ) = A - A S / B S B A + B × 100 where A and B are the experimental areas of the main and shake-up 2p peak of Cu2+, respectively, while AS/BS represents the theoretical value for the ratio between the main and shake-up 2p peaks of pure Cu2+ (i.e. Cu(OH)2 AS/BS = 1.57; CuCl2 = 1.63 [31]). It is important to note that the values for the distribution of Cu oxidation states extracted from curve fitting of experimental data and using the method of Jasieniak and Gerson did not exceed 5%, considered acceptable [31]; the values quoted in this study (i.e. Cu XPS 2 + , Cu XPS + and Cu XPS 0 ) are the mean. XPS data recorded from the Cu LMM region was used to calculate the modified Auger parameter α', defined as the sum of the binding energy of the Cu 2p 3/2 and the kinetic energy of the Cu LMM peaks [31]. The distribution of copper oxidation states was also examined using the Wagner plot generated with data extracted from the analysis of the photoelectron and Auger electron regions. Reference data (i.e. B.E., K.E. and I') extracted from [31,32] for Cu2+, Cu+ and Cu0 were also included in the plot to facilitate the elucidation of the surface copper species. The (powder) X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were collected with a Bruker/Siemens D500 instrument (radiation = Cu Kα, scan rate = 0.02° step−1, range = 5°≤ 2θ ≤ 85°). Diffractograms were compared with the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. Cu (004–0836), CeO2 (043–1002) and CeClO (153–4659), for identification. Metal particle morphology was evaluated by probe corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using a FEI Titan Themis unit equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The scanned images were collected on a Fischione High Angle Annular Dark Field or FEI Annular Dark Field detector using the FEI TIA software (version 4.9 SP1) for data acquisition and analysis. Specimen preparation involved (dry) deposition on a holey carbon/Au (or Ni) grid (300 Mesh). The surface area-weighted mean copper nanocrystal size (d) was obtained from a measurement of up to 170 individual metal nanoparticles using the relationship: (3) d = ∑ i n i · d i 3 ∑ i n i · d i 2 where n i is the number of particles of diameter d i. Copper particle size distribution fitting was performed using Gaussian line shape functions. The identification of elements from EDX analysis was based on the Gatan DigitalMicrograph software (Bruker database), which revealed the presence of (i) Cu (signals at 0.93, 8.05 and 8.90 keV) from the supported metal phase, (ii) Au (2.20, 9.71) or Ni (0.85, 7.48, 8.27) from the grid and (iii) Ce (4.84–5.80) and O (0.53) from the support."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing Reactions (stand-alone hydrogenation of phenylacetylene in toluene under H2, stand-alone dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol under N2 and coupled dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of benzyl alcohol/phenylacetylene under N2) were carried out in a (continuous) fixed-bed glass tubular reactor (i.d. = 15 mm, 433–573 K, 1 atm), after (in situ) catalyst activation under conditions of negligible mass/heat transfer constrains. The organic reactant(s) was(were) vaporised and reached reaction temperature in a preheating zone of (1 mm) borosilicate glass beads situated above the catalytic bed. The reaction temperature in the catalyst bed was monitored (continuously) with a thermocouple and kept constant (±1 K) by mixing the Cu/CeO2 catalyst (1–50 mg) with (75 µm) ground glass. The organic reactant(s) was(were) fed into the reactor at a fixed calibrated flow rate (2 × 10−2 cm3 min−1) via a glass air-tight syringe (Hamilton) and Teflon line with a microprocessor-controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific). The stand-alone (uncoupled) reactions were conducted in a co-current flow of N2 with benzyl alcohol (gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 3 × 103 h−1, molar copper to reactant feed rate (n/F benzyl alcohol) = 8 × 10−5 – 4 × 10−4 h) and H2 with phenylacetylene (GHSV = 3 × 103 h−1, n/F phenylacetylene = 2 × 10−4 – 5 × 10−2 h, H2 content 80 times in excess to the stoichiometric requirement for the formation of styrene). Reactant conversion in the stand-alone reactions was varied by changing the n/F, altering the amount of catalyst while maintaining the total volume of the bed constant (884 mm3). The coupled reaction was conducted in N2 (GHSV = 3 × 103 h−1, n/F phenylacetylene = 9 × 10−5 – 2 × 10−4 h, Alkyne:Alcohol molar ratio = 1–191). The reactor effluent was condensed in a liquid N2 trap for subsequent analysis, which was made by capillary gas chromatography (Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL, detector = FID, column = DB-1 J&W Scientific (length = 50 m, i.d. = 0.33 mm, film thickness = 0.20 μm)). Qualitative analysis for the presence of HCl was carried out by flowing the gas through a two-necked gas-scrubbing bottle containing an aqueous NaOH solution (2 × 10−3 M, pH = 8.9) kept under constant agitation at 300 rpm with independent pH (Corning 440 pH Bench-meter) analysis. Before each run, the system was flushed with N2. The reactants (benzyl alcohol (Acros organic, 99%) and phenylacetylene (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%)) and products/solvent (toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), benzaldehyde (Fischer Scientific, ≥99%), ethylbenzene (Fluka, ≥99%) and styrene (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%)) and the gasses (He, N2, and O2 (BOC, >99.99%)) were used as supplied, without further purification. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using the TurboChrom Workstation (version 6.3.2) chromatography data system. Calibration plots (not presented) were used to calculate reactant/product molar fractions (xi ). In a series of preliminary blank tests, there was negligible conversion by passing (i) each reactant in a stream of N2 or H2 over the (CeO2) support alone or through the empty reactor or (ii) phenylacetylene in a stream of N2 over the activated Cu/CeO2 catalysts. Reactant (i) conversion (X i) is defined by (4) X i ( % ) = Reactant i , in - Reactant i , out Reactant i , in × 100 and selectivity in terms of product “j” (S j) is given by (5) S j ( % ) = Product j , out Reactant i , in - Reactant i , out × 100 where the subscripts “in” and “out” indicate “inlet” and “outlet” gas streams, respectively. Catalytic activity is also expressed as initial production rate (R, molproduct molCu −1 h−1) defined as: (6) R ( mol j mol Cu - 1 h - 1 ) = F i × X i , 0 × S j n where X i,0 represents the initial conversion of reactant “i” determined from time on-stream measurements as described in detail in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S.2) according to [33]. Turnover frequency (TOF, initial production rate per surface copper, h−1) was obtained using the metal dispersion (D) derived from microscopy measurements according to: (7) TOF ( h - 1 ) = R D Hydrogen utilisation efficiency in the stand-alone hydrogenation vs. coupled process was assessed by: (8) H 2 utilisation efficiency = H 2 supplied H 2 consumed where “H2 supplied” is the molar hydrogen provided, either (i) via alcohol dehydrogenation or (ii) from an external gas cylinder supply, and “H2 consumed” indicates the amount utilised in phenylacetylene conversion corrected with the surface hydrogen post-TPR from H2-TPD; H2 utilisation values ≫ 1 indicate low efficiency. Carbon mass balance and data reproducibility was better than ±10%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation 3.1.1 H2-TPR/XPS/H2 chemisorption analyses Catalytic performance in dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions is dependent on the concentration of surface active sites. In the case of Cu/CeO2, this is linked to the Cu0 and Cu+ concentration at the surface. In addition, the metal hydrogen uptake capacity is of practical importance in hydrogenation applications [34]. Hydrogen TPR measurements were conducted to examine the reducibility of the copper phase. The surface composition and chemical/electronic state of copper in the activated catalysts was determined by XPS analysis. The hydrogen uptake capacity of the Cu/CeO2 catalysts was measured by hydrogen titration at reaction temperature (=498 K). The H2 TPR profiles for the DP1 (Ia), DP15 (Ib), IM1 (IIa) and IM15 (IIb) catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 ; hydrogen consumption and distribution of Cu oxidation states derived from curve fitting the H2-TPR response is presented in Table 1 . Each profile exhibits a broad positive peak (H2 consumption) over the temperature range ca. 400–500 K (DP samples) and ca. 600–670 K (IM), which are close to the range of values reported (413–505 K (DP) [35,36] and 523–648 K (IM) [37,38]) for the conversion of Cu2+ into metallic Cu. A stepwise Cu2+ → Cu+ → Cu0 sequence has been proposed elsewhere [20] based on H2-TPR measurements where a mixture of the three copper species prevailed at T ≥ 580 K [39]. The volume of hydrogen consumed exceeded (by a factor up to 2) the amount required for the formation of metallic copper in all the catalysts, but was significantly lower (up to a 96-fold) than that required for the reduction of CeO2 → Ce2O3. This result is indicative of additional hydrogen consumption by (i) surface Cl species generated from the (CuCl2) metal precursor [19] and/or (ii) the CeO2 carrier, that can result in partial reduction, notably at the Cu-support interface [40]. The H2-TPR profile for the DP1(573) sample (Fig. (Ia)) presents, after deconvolution, a main peak at T max = 446 K, corresponding to the reduction of Cu2+ → Cu+, the hydrogen uptake associated with this signal matched (to ±1%, Table 1) the amount required for the α transition. A peak at higher T max (= 454 K) and lower intensity can be related to a partial reduction to metallic copper (i.e. Cu+ → Cu0) [41]. The associated hydrogen consumption was significantly lower than the amount required for the full β transition (21 vs. 79 μmol g−1; Table 1) and is consistent with a mixture of Cu+ (74%) and Cu0 (26%) post H2-TPR. The presence of Cu+ and Cu0 species after thermal treatment in H2 at 423–673 K was also observed by Dandekar et al. (for Cu/C) [42] and Kundakovic and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos (for Cu/CeO2) [43]. An additional positive signal at 461 K can be attributed to partial reduction of the support, i.e. Ce4+→ Ce3+; γ, with the occurrence of oxygen vacancies as a result of spillover hydrogen, i.e. migration of H to the ceria support. The degree of copper reduction appears to be sensitive to the strength of metal-support interactions [44] where surface defects on the carrier can stabilise transition metal nanoparticles, rendering them less susceptible to reduction [43]. While the presence of Cu+ post H2-TPR can be attributed to strong copper interaction with CeO2 oxygen vacancies, there is also the possibility of a stabilisation of Cu+ species via the redox equilibrium Ce4+ + Cu0 ↔ Ce3+ + Cu+ [45]. The H2-TPR profile for the DP15(573) catalyst (Fig. (Ib)) is very similar to that recorded for DP1(573) (i.e. peaks at Tmax 442 ± 4 K, 451 ± 3 K and 464 ± 3 K), albeit a far greater difference between the experimental and theoretical hydrogen requirements for the (α, β, γ) transition steps, which results in a modified distribution of copper and Ce3+ species with different oxidation states (Cu2+ = 50%, Cu+ = 14, Cu0 = 36, Ce3+ = 15; Table 1). The presence of Cu2+ and Cu+ following activation in hydrogen at T ≥ 573 K has been previously demonstrated by CO chemisorption [42], H2-TPR [43] and XPS measurements [45] for oxide- (CeO2 and ZrO2) and carbon-supported Cu catalysts. The generation of larger copper nanoparticles on DP15(573) (vs. DP1(573)) post H2-TPR is likely due to the higher metal loading [46]. The lower metal dispersion in DP15(573) leads to (i) inhibition of hydrogen diffusion in the Cu cluster and (ii) weak metal-support interactions linked to the small area of contact at the interface between the metal nanocrystals and the CeO2 carrier which, in turn, hinders Cu2+ reduction and lowers the concentration of Cu+. The H2-TPR profiles measured for the IM samples (Fig. 2 (II)) also exhibited three main peaks at T ≤ 658 K but they were shifted to a significantly higher temperature (by ~ 185 K) relative to the DP catalysts. This suggests variations in metal-support interactions that can be linked to the different (i) metal precursor (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O vs. CuCl2) and (ii) preparation method (DP vs. IM). A surface Cl content > 1 ppb (>1 ppm for 1–4% wt. supported copper catalysts prepared via CuCl2 impregnation [19]) has been demonstrated to facilitate Cu surface mobility with the formation of larger metal particles [47]. As the IM samples were prepared using CuCl2, it is to be expected that these catalysts will bear larger metal nanoparticles, interacting weakly with the support and requiring higher reduction temperatures. Chen et al. [48], studying the hydrogen TPR of several Cu/CeO2 samples reported a ca. 50 K increase in reduction temperature for samples pre-treated in different atmospheres (i.e. air, vacuum, hydrogen) and attributed this to a change in the electronic state of Cu nanoparticles that is dependent on metal dispersion with a shift to higher reduction temperature for bigger particles. Moreover, a stronger Cu/support interaction in the DP catalysts [19] improves the stabilisation of the excess electrons involved in the reduction step [49], lowering the temperature requirements. The H2-TPR profile for the IM15(773) (Fig. 2 (IIb)) exhibits, in addition to the peaks at T ≤ 658 K, signals at T max = 670 K, 678 K and 690 K, indicative of a multi-modal copper size distribution. The two H2-TPR signals at 670 and 678 K can be tentatively attributed to α and β transitions, respectively, during the reduction of larger Cu nanoparticles [50]. The H2-TPR signal at 690 K can be associated with the generation of HCl from CuCl2 (i.e. δ transition) linked to (i) Cl bonded to Cu and/or (ii) oxychloride species on the support. A similar rationale has been provided by Bond and co-workers [19] for the TPR hydrogen consumption peak recorded at T max = 700 K in their study of Cu/SiO2 and Cu/Al2O3 prepared with CuCl2 as metal precursor. The results from H2-TPR analysis demonstrate the generation of supported Cu particles with oxidation states in the range Cu0 = 14–77%, Cu+ = 14–74% and Cu2+ = 0–50% (Table 1). The 1% wt. Cu/CeO2 samples exhibit full reduction of Cu2+, whereas this step is hampered in the 15% wt. catalysts, which we attribute to inhibited hydrogen diffusion. Weak metal support interactions in IM (vs. DP) catalysts with increasing metal content (15% vs. 1% wt.) lowers Cu+ content. IM15(773) deviates somehow from this trend, where stabilisation via Cl− complexation [19] results in a high concentration of copper (I). The H2-TPR measurements provide critical information on bulk characteristics which can differ greatly from surface properties [51]. The distribution of Cu oxidation states on the catalyst surface can be extracted from data fitting in the Cu 2p core level. However, the results can be compromised by the overlapping of copper species (i.e. Cu+ and Cu0) [52]. It has been demonstrated [52], that analysis of X-ray induced Auger transitions (i.e. electrons excited as a consequence of the relaxation process following the ejection of an electron from a core orbital) can serve as an additional measurement to investigate copper on the catalyst surface, where the spectra of Cu+ and Cu0 exhibit distinct peak(s) and shape. Surface copper and Ce3+ was examined by XPS analysis of the Cu 2p 3/2 (Fig. 3 (a)), Cu LMM Auger (Fig. 4 ) and Ce 3d regions (Fig. 3(b)); the values derived from curve fitting of the XPS measurements are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5 (I). XPS analysis of the 1% wt. loaded samples (DP1(573) (Fig. 3 (Ia) and IM1(773) (IVa)) confirmed a total reduction of Cu2+ to generate a mixture of Cu+ and Cu0 species. In contrast, the 15% wt. catalysts (DP15(573) Fig. 3 (IIa), DP15(773) (IIIa) and IM15(773) (Va)) exhibit an additional XPS signal at 943 ± 1 eV that can be related to the presence of Cu2+, i.e. shake-up satellite peak that can be linked to the O 2p → Cu 3d transition [53]. A greater Cu2+ content was recorded with increasing metal content (15 vs. 1% wt.), lower activation temperature (573 compared to 773 K) and for samples prepared by IM (vs. DP). The results in the Cu LMM kinetic energy region (K.E.) 900–930 eV for DP15(573) (Ia) and IM15(773) (Ib), as representatives, are depicted in Fig. 4; Auger spectra of standards Cu2+, Cu+ and Cu0 are included to illustrate the level of similarity. The Auger spectrum for the DP15(573) presents a main peak at K.E. = 918.1 eV that is characteristic of Cu0 (K.E. = 918.6 eV, [31]), although the profile shape is similar to that of Cu2+. On the other hand, the main signal for IM15(773) (915.1 eV) can be ascribed to Cu+ (915.2 eV, [31]) although the response largely converges with the profile for Cu2+. The results from the analysis in the LMM Auger region demonstrate that major contributions due to Cu+ and Cu0 for DP15(573) and IM15(773) catalysts, respectively, can be excluded. This is in agreement with the low concentrations of Cu+ and Cu0 (i.e. 13%, Table 1) extracted from the curve fitting of the XPS spectra. The Wagner plot can be used as an additional tool for the elucidation of copper oxidation states on the catalyst surface [32]. In this approach, the photoelectron binding energy (B.E.) is plotted as a function of the kinetic energy of the Auger electron (K.E.) and represented by lines with slopes of −1 intercepting α' (see Materials and Methods section) and −3 intercepting I' (i.e. initial state parameter; values in this work extracted from [32]). The values of K.E. and B.E. for the DP15(573) and IM15(773) samples in the Wagner plot (Fig. 4 (II)) were obtained from the survey spectra (see Fig. S.3 in Supplementary Information) and the high-resolution spectra (Fig. 4(I) and 3(a)). The results for DP15(573) suggest the presence of Cu2+, (i.e. experimental data follows straight line with slope = -1 and αꞌ = 1851.33 eV [31]). In the case of IM15(773), the points fall in the region characteristic of Cu+ species (i.e. straight line with slope = -3 and Iꞌ = 3713.7 eV). Moreover, the calculated value of αꞌ = 1852.05 ± 0.05 eV for DP15(573) is close to that characteristic of Cu2+ , while that of IM15(773) (αꞌ = 1847.30 ± 0.10 eV) suggests the presence of Cu+ (1847.51 eV in CuCl [31]). The predominance of Cu2+ and Cu+ in DP15(573) and IM15(773), respectively, confirms the reliability of the distribution of copper oxidation states extracted from XPS data fitting in the 2p 3/2 region. The presence of Cu+ (DP1(573) and DP15(773)) and Cu0 (IM1(773)) species was also proved for the rest of the samples by data inclusion in the Wagner plot, which further confirms the results from XPS fitting. Consistent values for both measurements (H2-TPR and XPS) were obtained in the case of the low loading DP1(573) (i.e. Cu2+ = 0%; Cu+ = 74; Cu0 = 26, Table 1) and IM1(773) (0; 23; 77). However, there are inconsistencies in those obtained with each method for the high loading samples. We should flag that there is a dearth of published work recording Cu oxidation states based on more than one analytical technique with XPS [28] or CO chemisorption [42] typically used. Nonetheless, there are reports in the literature that have considered a combination of XPS, XANES and EXAFS [54] or H2-TPR and O2-TPO measurements [55]. The discrepancy observed between H2-TPR and XPS data can be attributed to the type of information obtained with both methodologies. Indeed, H2-TPR is a “bulk” analytical technique while XPS is applicable for surface analysis. A source of disagreement can result from the information depth of the XPS measurements (ca. 3 nm [56]). This suggests copper nanoparticles >4 nm in the high loading Cu/CeO2 catalysts, in agreement with previous studies [57,58] that have reported Cu nanocrystals of 8–18 nm for oxide (SiO2, Al2O3) supported copper catalysts with similar loading (16–20% wt.) prepared by IM and DP. Although the combination of analytical methods employed in this work is complementary, catalytic reactions occur on the catalyst surface, consequently the distribution of Cu oxidation states based on XPS measurements was adopted in subsequent tests. The Ce 3d profile for the fresh (untreated) CeO2 (Fig. 3 (VIb)) and hydrogen treated ((VIIb)) are similar and dominated by three spin–orbit doublets (peaks v/u, v''/u'' and v'''/u''' at 883 eV/901 eV, 888/907 and 899/917, respectively) that can be associated with the 3d 5/2/3d 3/2 levels of Ce4+ [30]. Two additional spin–orbit doublets (peaks v0/u0 and v'/u'; 880 eV/899 eV and 886/904) are also in evidence and can be attributed to the 3d 5/2/3d 3/2 levels of Ce3+ [30]. The extracted surface concentration of Ce3+ (11 ± 1%) matches the value quoted by Zhang et al. for bulk CeO2 [30]. The equivalent XPS response was expected considering the higher (≥823 K) temperature requirement for the Ce4+ → Ce3+ reduction [59]. A comparison of the XPS spectra of Cu/CeO2 (Fig. 3 (Ib-Vb)) with those of CeO2 ((VIb-VIIb)) suggests that incorporation of Cu served to facilitate CeO2 surface reduction with an increase (by up to 28%) in the concentration of Ce3+. Enhancements of up to 40% in Ce3+ surface content has been reported post-Pd incorporation [60]. This can be tentatively attributed to spillover hydrogen on Cu/CeO2 that can participate in a superficial reduction of the oxide carrier, a result that is consistent with H2-TPR measurements. The correlation between concentration of Ce3+ and surface metallic copper (CuXPS 0, %) is shown in Fig. 5(I), where there is a clear linear increase in Ce3+ density with increasing amount of Cu0 (0 → 77%). This tendency suggests H2 adsorption at Cu0 sites, and finds agreement with theoretical work (density functional theory (DFT)) demonstrating that molecular hydrogen does not chemisorb on Cu2+ or Cu+, but occurs on Cu0 [61] via dissociative adsorption [62]. Hydrogen uptake measured at reaction temperature (498 K) on all the Cu/CeO2 catalysts (1–147 μmol gCu −1) was similar (1–158 μmol gCu −1) to values reported previously for (Al2O3 and SiO2) supported Cu catalysts [63,64], but far lower than the uptake for standard transition metal catalysts used in industrial hydrogenations (e.g. 2023 μmol gPd −1 for Pd/Al2O3 [65]). This is consistent with the high energy barrier for H2 dissociation due to the filled d band of copper [66]. The hydrogen chemisorption vs. CuXPS 0 linear relationship shown in Fig. 5 (II), where H2 uptake capacity increases with increasing Cu0 surface content (13 → 77%), is further evidence for hydrogen chemisorption on metallic copper. 3.1.2 XRD/STEM-EDX The morphology of the supported copper nanoparticles was examined by combined XRD (Fig. 6 ) and STEM-EDX measurements (Figs. 7 and 8 ). All the catalysts present diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3°, 59.1°, 69.4°, 76.7° and 79.1° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420) planes of CeO2 with a cubic fluorite-type structure (JCPDS-ICDD reference 043–1002). The XRD patterns for the high loading Cu samples (DP15(573) (II), DP15(773) (III) and IM15(773) (V)) present additional signals at 2θ = 43.4°, 50.5° and 74.2° characteristic of (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Cu. The absence of Cu0 diffraction peaks in the 1% wt. Cu/CeO2 catalysis (i.e. DP1(573) (I) and IM1(773) (IV)) can be linked to the low metal loading and/or the presence of small (<5 nm) Cu particles [67]. The intensity (I) and width (W) of the main Cu XRD peak (2θ = 43.4°) is sensitive to copper nanoparticle size where a higher I/W ratio is indicative of larger metal nanoparticles [67]. Taking the three high loading Cu/CeO2 samples, the variation in I/W suggests the following sequence of increasing copper nanoparticle size: DP15(573) (I/W = 50 counts degree−1) ~ DP15(773) (60) < IM15(773) (440). The XRD diffractogram pattern for IM15(773) exhibits additional signals at 2θ = 12.9°, 25.4°, 30.9°, 34.1°, 40.8°, 44.3°, 51.7°, 57.1°, 76.9° and 79.1° due to the (001), (101), (110), (102), (112), (200), (211), (212), (115) and (312) planes of CeClO. This result is in line with the report of Soria et al. [68], who demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, using oxygen as a probe molecule, the formation of a cerium oxychloride layer post hydrogen thermal treatment to 773 K on the surface of Au/CeO2 and Rh/CeO2 prepared by impregnation using a chlorine containing metal precursor. The absence of detectable XRD signals for CeClO in IM1(773) (IV) can be attributed to the lower metal and Cl content. STEM-EDX analysis (see micrographs for DP15(573) (Ia) and IM15(773) (Ib) in Fig. 7, as representative samples) have revealed copper nanoparticles at the nanoscale (1–20 nm) for all the catalysts in this work. High magnification micrographs of individual nanoparticles (I) with associated EDX spectrum (II) on the surface of DP1(573) (a) and DP15(573) (b), as representatives, in Fig. 8 demonstrate that the Cu component is present as discrete nanoparticles with a pseudo-spherical morphology. Metal particle size distribution is illustrated by the histograms presented in Fig. 7 (II); mean Cu diameters (d) are shown in Table 1. The nature of the metal precursor, metal loading and preparation method are critical in determining the ultimate size distribution [69]. The mean diameter obtained from STEM analysis for DP1(573) (2 nm) and IM1(773) (4 nm) is consistent with the absence of XRD peaks characteristic of copper. Taking the same metal content and final activation temperature (i.e. 15% wt. and 773 K), the Cu/CeO2 samples prepared by impregnation using CuCl2 (vs. deposition precipitation with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) are characterised by a broader distribution of larger Cu particles, indicative of weaker copper-CeO2 interactions. As expected, the samples with the higher metal content treated at increased activation temperature bear the larger Cu nanoparticles, which can be attributed to greater mobility and agglomeration of Cu species that results in a wider size distribution [69]. This trend is in agreement with the distribution of copper oxidation states from H2-TPR and XPS measurements. The degree of heterogeneity for the high loading samples is illustrated by the results for the IM15(773) catalyst (Fig. 7 (IIb)) with an apparent bimodal distribution of smaller (ca. 9 nm) and larger (ca. 14 nm) Cu nanocrystals, consistent with the four H2-TPR peaks attributed to α and β transitions in Fig. 2 (IIb)."
7,Catalytic response,"3.2 Catalytic response The characterisation measurements demonstrate the generation of a series of Cu/CeO2 samples with copper oxidation states in the range Cu0 = 13–77%, Cu+ = 13–74% and Cu2+ = 0–55%. The impact of variations in the copper oxidation state on the tandem dehydrogenation-hydrogenation of benzyl alcohol with phenylacetylene has been considered. It has been demonstrated that Cu2+ is inactive in hydrogenation (e.g. isoprene conversion over 1% wt. Cu/ThO2 [70]) and dehydrogenation reactions (e.g. ethanol transformation using 20% wt. Cu/Al2O3 [17]). In order to confirm the inactivity of Cu2+ in the catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol and phenylacetylene, a (commercial) CuO was purchased and tested in the two (independent) reactions. CuO exhibited a lack of initial activity in both (dehydrogenation and hydrogenation) reactions. Based on these results, Cu0 and Cu+ were considered to establish the impact of metal oxidation state on catalytic performance. We first examine the catalytic response in the stand-alone phenyl acetylene hydrogenation, using an external hydrogen supply, and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation (in N2) over the five Cu/CeO2 catalysts. A compilation of the studies in the open literature on hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol is presented Table S.1 of the Supplementary Information; where pertinent, our results are related to the trends emerging from the tabulated studies. 3.2.1 Stand-alone phenylacetylene hydrogenation The stand-alone phenylacetylene hydrogenation over all the catalysts generated styrene and ethylbenzene as the only two products, with no evidence of ring reduction (to ethylcyclohexane) which has been observed for reaction over Pt/C [71]. The stepwise (CC → CC → CC bond) hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to ethylbenzene through styrene as reaction intermediate is presented in Fig. 1 (steps (III) and (IVb)), which also includes a direct (parallel CC → CC reduction) pathway (step (IVa)) [72]. At conversions ≤50%, reaction over all Cu catalysts generated styrene as the main product with secondary generation of ethylbenzene, consistent with the work of Merrill [73] working under high H2 pressure (10 atm) using Cu/Al2O3. In contrast, under similar reaction conditions full hydrogenation to ethylbenzene was promoted over Au/Al2O3 [34]. In each case, we recorded a temporal loss of activity to attain a pseudo-steady state after ca. 2 h (see variation of phenylacetylene conversion (X phenylacetyelene) with time on-stream over DP1(573), as a representative, in Fig. 9 (I)). Loss of activity in hydrogenation reactions over copper catalysts has been previously reported and ascribed to carbon deposition [39] and/or strong reactant/product adsorption on Cu [74]. In order to gain some insight into the reaction mechanism, the dependence of styrene selectivity on phenylacetylene conversion was investigated. At similar levels of conversion, variations in the Cu0/Cu+ of the five catalysts in this work did not impact on product selectivity (X phenylacetylene = 15 ± 1% → S styrene = 93 ± 2%, Fig. 9 (III)). In contrast, product distribution was sensitive to phenylacetylene conversion (Fig. 10 (I)). We recorded formation of ethylbenzene in trace quantities (S ethylbenzene ≤ 5%) at low phenylacetylene conversions (≤3%) and a shift to preferential ethylbenzene generation at the expense of styrene with increasing phenylacetylene conversion (X phenylacetylene > 50%). These results are consistent with a predominantly (stepwise) phenylacetylene → styrene → ethylbenzene mechanism following paths (III) and (IVb) in Fig. 1, typical for hydrogenation of alkynes in gas phase operation [75]. It is important to state that, under similar reaction conditions the Cu/CeO2 in this work delivered a 3 times greater specific styrene production rate [72] and enhanced selectivity (90% vs. 82% [76]) compared to Pd/Al2O3, a standard catalyst in industrial alkyne hydrogenation [25]. The effect(s) of copper oxidation state on the activity delivered by Cu/CeO2 was considered at the same degree of conversion (X phenylacetylene = 5 ± 2%) and the resultant variation of turnover frequencies (TOF, specific (per Cu surface atom) rate, see Eq. (7) and Table 1) with Cu0/Cu+ molar ratio is shown in Fig. 11 (I). The experimentally determined specific rate increased linearly with increasing Cu0/Cu+ in the catalyst. A similar trend was observed by Filonenko and co-workers [77] using (Group 11) Au in the hydrogenation of CO2, where a decrease in Au0 content was accompanied by a progressive decrease in activity. The opposite effect has also been recorded, with Ma et al. [55] reporting a concomitant increase in ester hydrogenation rate and Cu+/Cu0 ratio. The sequence of increasing activity over the Cu/CeO2 catalysts (i.e. IM15(773) < DP1(573) < DP15(573) < DP15(773) < IM1(773)) mimics the increase in H2 chemisorption capacity. The enhancement in hydrogen uptake that results from a greater Cu0 content (Fig. 5 (II)) was accompanied by an elevated hydrogenation rate. We could find no comparable published study of phenylacetylene hydrogenation over supported copper. However, our results are consistent with experimental work that has demonstrated a zero order dependence in -C≡C- bond coverage and identify H2 splitting as the rate-limiting step for the gas phase hydrogenation of propyne over Cu catalysts [39]. In addition to catalytic activity/selectivity, hydrogen utilisation efficiency is a key parameter that must be optimised to ensure process sustainability. The limited H2 chemisorption on Cu (i.e. at least 15 times lower compared to noble metals typically used in hydrogenations [65]) results in low H2 utilisation efficiency (200–400 vs. 1 for reaction stoichiometry; see Eq. (8) ) which represents a severe sustainability gap. 3.2.2 Stand-alone benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation. The consequence of changes in the copper oxidation state on the independent gas phase benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation was also investigated. All the Cu catalysts exhibited an essentially time invariant activity (see Fig. 9 (II) for DP1(573), as a representative), where benzaldehyde was the main product (up to 95%, path (I) in Fig. 1), while toluene was generated as a secondary product via hydrogenolysis (path (II)). In contrast, deactivation in liquid phase dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol over Pd/Al2O3 has been reported and attributed to active site blockage due to adsorption of CO from decarbonylation [78]. Reaction selectivity can be assessed from Fig. 10 (II), were benzaldehyde selectivity (S benzaldehyde) is shown as a function of Cu+/Cu0 molar ratio. We observe a tendency of decreasing S benzaldehyde (95 → 85%) with increasing Cu+/Cu0. Our results indicate a dependence of selectivity on copper oxidation state, which impacts on the benzyl alcohol adsorption/activation mechanism. There is limited evidence in the literature of a dehydrogenation selectivity dependence on copper oxidation state [22]. Cassinelli et al. [17] studying the dehydrogenation of ethanol over Cu/Al2O3 recorded a greater selectivity to ethyl acetate (via condensation) with increasing concentration of Cu0. Alcohol adsorption (through the polarised oxygen (O2–) of the –OH group [79]) on Lewis acid sites [80] with hydrogen scission of the C-OH bond following a nucleophilic attack [81] generates toluene. Benzyl alcohol adsorption can also proceed at the Cu-oxide interface with the –OH functionality binding to the carrier and the α-hydrogen interacting with copper [80], to form benzaldehyde. The reaction follows a two-step mechanism where abstraction of the second (α-)hydrogen through a carbocation-type transition state [82] is rate determining [80]. From a consideration of the copper electronic properties, a (Lewis acid) positive charge (Cu+) should facilitate interaction with the O2– of the hydroxyl group, favouring hydrogenolysis (to toluene). Specific benzaldehyde production rate (TOF) was calculated and the Cu0/Cu+ dependence is illustrated in Fig. 11(I) where a linear correlation is in evidence. The use of Cu/CeO2 catalysts in the non-oxidative gas phase dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol resulted in a significantly greater activity (by up to a factor of 16) relative to reactions over supported Au [80,83] and Pd [83] catalysts with comparable metal size (2–12 nm) in both, gas and liquid phase operation. The Cu0 rich catalyst (IM1(773); Cu0/Cu+ = 3.4) delivered a specific dehydrogenation rate that was twice that recorded for the lower content system (IM15(773); 0.3). This result suggests that Cu0 stabilises the rate determining transition complex with a resultant increase in reactivity, i.e. repulsion between positively charged Cu+ and the cationic transition state results in elevated intrinsic dehydrogenation efficiency with enhanced Cu0/Cu+ content (0.3 → 3.4). This result finds agreement in the work of Kon et al. [84] who, studying the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of 2-octanol over Re/Al2O3, demonstrated enhanced activity with increasing Re0 concentration. A greater dehydrogenation (vs. hydrogenation) activity is essential to ensure sufficient hydrogen supply in the coupling system. The results in this section confirm that this prerequisite is met by all the catalysts where hydrogen produced was at least 5 times greater than that consumed in the phenylacetylene hydrogenation step. 3.2.3 Coupled benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation with phenylacetylene hydrogenation The results presented in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 demonstrate that undesired full hydrogenation to ethylbenzene (path (IV) in Fig. 1) and hydrogenolysis to toluene (path (II)) were promoted in the stand-alone hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol, respectively, over the Cu/CeO2 catalysts. In contrast, the selectivity response is striking in that the five copper catalysts promoted the sole formation of the two target products, styrene and benzaldehyde, in the coupled process. The generation of styrene (from phenylacetylene transformation in N2 atmosphere) demonstrates effective use of the hydrogen generated in situ from the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. We could find no comparable study in the literature where a switch in selectivity was observed for standard vs. coupled alkyne hydrogenation with alcohol dehydrogenation. Nonetheless, Nagaraja and co-workers [18] studying the tandem dehydrogenation-hydrogenation of cyclohexanol-furfural over bulk Cu-MgO-Cr2O3 reported enhanced selectivity to cyclohexanone (from 75 to 100%) and furfuryl alcohol (50 → 100%) relative to the stand-alone reactions, but the authors did not elaborate further. Product distribution was largely insensitive to variations in X phenylacetylene (Fig. 10(I)) and copper oxidation state (Fig. 10 (II)) where 100% selectivity of both target products was maintained. We associate this switch in selectivity (from full to partial hydrogenation) towards styrene generation to the low H2:phenylacetylene molar ratio, close to stoichiometry in the coupling process (vs. 80:1 molH2 molphenylacetylene −1 in stand-alone hydrogenation). In support of this, Bridier et al. [39] studying the gas phase hydrogenation of propyne over a series of (Al2O3, SiO2 and hydrotalcite) supported Cu catalysts reported absence of triple bond over-hydrogenation (to propane) at inlet H2:propyne < 8. The suppressed hydrogenolysis to toluene can be tentatively linked to the presence of phenylacetylene as a hydrogen acceptor. Likewise, studying the same reaction over Cu/hydrotalcite by adding CO2 to the feed Gurram et al. [26] recorded a simultaneous decrease in toluene generation and a 2-fold increase in benzaldehyde selectivity, attributed to consumption of in situ generated H2 in the dehydrogenation step via reverse water gas shift reaction. Under similar reaction conditions, reactant conversion in the coupled process, shown in Fig. 9(I) (X phenylacetylene) and (II) (X benzyl alcohol), exhibit a similar time on-stream dependence to that observed in the stand-alone (hydrogenation and dehydrogenation) reactions, albeit greater phenylacetylene conversion and lower dehydrogenation activity in the coupling system. The generation of activated atomic hydrogen (from benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation) serves to circumvent the activation of molecular hydrogen (rate determining in the stand-alone hydrogenation [39]), thereby increasing hydrogenation activity. The lower dehydrogenation conversion in the coupled process can be tentatively linked to competition for (copper) adsorption sites that must result in a displacement of benzyl alcohol from the surface by phenylacetylene. Our premise is in accordance with the reported higher (~10 kcal mol−1) desorption energy barrier from Cu for acetylene [85] relative to ethanol and isopropanol [86]. Coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation can also proceed through direct hydrogen transfer (i.e. the CC bond in the alkyne is attacked by the α-hydrogen in the alcohol) following a mechanism similar to the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV), with a requirement for having the two active sites for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in close proximity [87]. The MPV mechanism was initially proposed for homogeneous systems where good results have been established in the liquid phase tandem hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds with alcohols [87]. Nonetheless, there have been several published studies [87,88] where it has been successfully employed in gas and liquid phase coupling processes over (metal supported) heterogeneous catalysts. Benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation in the coupled process following a MPV-like mechanism cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, inhibited hydrogen removal in the direct (vs. stepwise) process has been demonstrated elsewhere [89] and is consistent with the decrease in dehydrogenation activity for the coupled (vs. stand-alone) process. The extracted styrene and benzaldehyde TOF (from conversions vs. time on-stream profiles, Fig. 9) were used to establish the dependence between hydrogenation/dehydrogenation activity and copper oxidation state in the coupled process. The results are presented in Fig. 11 (II) where a linear correlation with respect to Cu+/Cu0 concentration for both reactions is in evidence. There are reports in the literature that demonstrate (via UV-PES and IR spectroscopy) alkyne adsorption on both metallic [85] and electron deficient [90] copper sites. In the case of (Pt-group) metals with high H2 chemisorption capacity (i.e. H2/Metal mol ratio ≥ 1 [91]), it has been proposed that -C≡C- bond adsorption/activation is rate determining in phenylacetylene hydrogenation [91]. The ceria supported Cu+ facilitates adsorption/activation of the (electron-donating) -C≡C- group in phenylacetylene through an electrostatic interaction (alkyne σ-donation followed by copper π-backdonation [92]) where a higher concentration of electron deficient copper results in an increased specific hydrogenation rate. Phenylacetylene adsorption on Cu+ limits the number of active sites available for the adsorption of benzyl alcohol at the hydroxyl oxygen and serves to suppress hydrogenolysis to toluene (Fig. 10 (II)). It should be noted that IM15(773) with the highest chlorine content (Table 1) deviates somehow from the general trend. We tentatively attribute the lower hydrogenation activity over IM15(773) to consumption of the available hydrogen in the conversion of Cl to HCl, consistent with the findings of Ordóñez et al. [93] who showed a decrease of (toluene) hydrogenation activity that was accompanied by the release of HCl from the catalyst surface. In order to test this premise, we monitored the pH of an aqueous NaOH trap before, during and after reaction where the solution pH progressively decreased (from 8.9) to reach 7.5 after 3 h as a result of HCl produced [94]. A similarly greater TOF with increasing Cu+/Cu0 ratio was recorded for the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol in the coupled process (Fig. 11 (II)). We envision a surface mechanism where phenylacetylene is adsorbed on Cu+ sites while benzyl alcohol is activated (via the –OH group) on Ce4+–O2− in close proximity to the copper nanoparticles. The uncoordinated α-hydrogen of the alcohol attacks [79] the activated triple bond which removes the hydroxyl hydrogen (from benzyl alcohol) in a concerted fashion to form a (six-membered cyclic) activated complex yielding the simultaneous formation of styrene and benzaldehyde. An increase in Cu+ content on the catalyst surface results in enhanced dehydrogenation activity. A similar mechanism was proposed by Wang et al. [95] for the liquid phase coupled 1-octanol dehydrogenation with styrene hydrogenation over Cu/La2O2CO3, although the authors did not identify the copper oxidation state active in the tandem process. The catalytic results suggest that the production of styrene and benzaldehyde in the stand-alone and coupled processes is favoured predominantly by Cu0 and Cu+, respectively. This has been accounted for in terms of a change in (i) the rate-determining step in the hydrogenation (i.e. activation of H2 vs. -C≡C- bond in the stand-alone and coupled reactions, respectively) and (ii) dehydrogenation mechanism (i.e. stepwise vs. concerted α-hydrogen elimination for stand-alone and tandem processes, respectively). Our results find agreement with reported modified catalytic response in hydrogenation of furaldehydes over Ru-catalysts, where metallic [96] and electron deficient [13] ruthenium species were identified as the active sites in the stand-alone and coupled reactions, respectively. Moreover, alcohol dehydrogenation in tandem processes over catalysts in which the active sites for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation are in close proximity, predominantly follow a MPV mechanism, where alcohol → hydrogen-acceptor hydride transfer is rate-determining [79]. We must stress that a switch from stand-alone hydrogenation to the coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation process (without external hydrogen supply) resulted in full phenylacetylene → styrene conversion, i.e. 100% yield of the target vinyl monomer, with a remarkably greater (two orders of magnitude) hydrogen utilisation. This exceeds the highest yields reported for gas phase hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (ca. 31% using Pd/Al2O3 [72]) and commercial production of styrene through ethylbenzene dehydrogenation (ca. 70% [97]). DP1(573) delivered the highest specific hydrogenation rate with almost full hydrogen utilisation and, therefore, it was employed for further analyses. The H2/alkyne ratio is key in determining the rate of alkene production where changes in hydrogen partial pressure affect available hydrogen on the surface. With the aim of further enhancing overall catalyst performance, we examined the effect of modifying the Alcohol:Alkyne molar feed ratio; the results obtained are presented in Table 2 . In each case, we achieved full selectivity to the target products (benzaldehyde and styrene). At Alcohol:Alkyne = 0.1 the amount of hydrogen generated in the dehydrogenation step is not sufficient to account for the recorded hydrogenation rate (i.e. 70 vs. 100 h−1). Alkyne hydrogenation can be enhanced by contributions due to spillover hydrogen (i.e. atomic hydrogen generated during activation via dissociative adsorption of H2 on supported metal sites that can migrate to the support). H2-TPD is a practical analysis that can be used to quantify spillover hydrogen. The greater than expected styrene TOF can be correlated with surface available hydrogen where H2-TPD is related to phenylacetylene consumption rate, closing the balance of H2 utilisation efficiency (i.e. 1 vs. 0.8). An increase in Alcohol:Alkyne (1 → 18) served to elevate hydrogen generated in the dehydrogenation step (step (I), Fig. 1) and styrene TOF (from 115 to 375 h−1) with 1.0–1.2 hydrogen utilisation efficiency. Reaction at greater Alcohol:Alkyne (31 → 191) further enhanced hydrogen production to attain a similar TOF to that achieved in the stand-alone dehydrogenation (i.e. 1030 vs. 1046 h−1). This result further confirms reactant competition with inhibited stepwise conversion of benzyl alcohol in the presence of phenylacetylene. Nonetheless, at high Alcohol:Alkyne ratio (≥31) we observed a decrease in styrene production where full hydrogen utilisation could not be maintained. The carbonyl group in benzaldehyde bears a higher electron density than the -C≡C- bond in phenylacetylene [98], with a consequent stronger interaction with Cu+ sites on CeO2. The higher production of benzaldehyde (at increased benzyl alcohol TOF) must decrease the number of active sites available for -C≡C- adsorption/activation (rate limiting in the hydrogenation step of the coupled process), lowering styrene TOF. The less effective hydrogen utilisation can be linked to low phenylacetylene surface coverage, where the amount of hydrogen generated is greater than that required for full transformation to styrene. We have achieved a significantly higher specific styrene production rate in the coupled process relative to reported value for stand-alone hydrogenation over Cu catalysts (375 h−1 vs. 0.2 h−1 [99]). The applicability of pseudo-first order kinetic treatment can be tested using the relationship [33]: (9) ln 1 ( 1 - X i , 0 ) = k · n F i where n/F i (s) represents the Cu molar ratio in the catalyst bed to reactant “i” (i.e. phenylacetylene or benzyl alcohol) inlet flow rate. The ln[1/(1-X i, 0)] vs. n/F i linear relationship for the coupled hydrogenation (Ia) and dehydrogenation (Ib) steps shown in Fig. 12 , confirms adherence to pseudo-first order behaviour. The sole formation of styrene and benzaldehyde was maintained in the 433–575 K temperature range. The Arrhenius plots for the hydrogenation Fig. 12 (IIa) and dehydrogenation (IIb) reactions in the coupled process delivered apparent activation energies of ΔE a hydrogenation = 75 kJ mol−1 and ΔE a dehydrogenation = 59 kJ mol−1, comparable with those obtained in the stand-alone reactions (ΔE a hydrogenation = 88 kJ mol−1, ΔE a dehydrogenation = 44 kJ mol−1; see Fig. S.4 in the Supplementary Information). We could not find any reported activation energy for a comparable phenylacetylene-benzyl alcohol coupling system in the literature. However, the apparent values obtained are similar to those recorded for phenylacetylene hydrogenation (using an external hydrogen supply) over Pd/C [100] (55 kJ mol−1) and alcohol (ethanol [101] and propanol [86]) dehydrogenation over carbon- and SiO2-supported Cu catalysts (50–115 kJ mol−1). We recorded a lower activation energy in the dehydrogenation step, further demonstrating that hydrogen generation is not rate determining in phenylacetylene → styrene transformation.

8,Conclusions,"The results in this study support the following conclusions: i. Activation in hydrogen of 1 and 15% wt. Cu/CeO2 prepared by deposition–precipitation and impregnation over the temperature range 573–773 K generated supported Cu nanoparticles (2–13 nm) with oxidation states in the range Cu0 = 13–77%, Cu+ = 13–74% and Cu2+ = 0–55% as confirmed by XPS, XRD and STEM-EDX measurements. ii. The H2-TPR results are consistent with a stepwise Cu2+ → Cu+ → Cu0 transformation with complete reduction of Cu2+ for the low loading samples bearing small (2–4 nm) metal nanoparticles. Inhibited H2 diffusion and weak metal support interactions for larger (7–13 nm) copper nanocrystals in the high loading Cu/CeO2 catalysts results in a mixture of Cu2+, Cu+ and Cu0 species post H2-TPR; the presence of bigger metal particles increases the temperature requirements for the reduction of the copper phase. iii. The generation of styrene and ethylbenzene via partial- and full-hydrogenation was observed in the stand-alone gas phase hydrogenation of phenylacetylene with low H2 utilisation efficiency. Although the copper oxidation state did not impact significantly on product distribution, we demonstrate a greater turnover frequency (TOF) over samples with increased Cu0/Cu+ attributed to elevated hydrogen uptake capacity. iv. Benzyl alcohol dehydrogenation produced benzaldehyde (over metallic copper) and toluene (via C-OH hydrogenolysis over Cu+). v. The coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation of benzyl alcohol with phenylacetylene over all the Cu/CeO2 catalysts resulted in the sole formation of the targets benzaldehyde and styrene products. An increase in Cu+/Cu0 was accompanied by an enhanced specific styrene and benzaldehyde production rate (TOF). We can account for this response on the basis of variations in the rate-determining step (in hydrogenation) and reaction mechanism (in dehydrogenation) for the coupled vs. stand alone processes. Reaction exclusivity was maintained over the temperature range 433–573 K (ΔE a hydrogenation = 75 kJ mol−1 and ΔE a dehydrogenation = 59 kJ mol−1) to attain 100% yield of styrene. vi. Full hydrogen utilisation and greater (up to 3-times) styrene TOF was recorded in the coupled dehydrogenation-hydrogenation process relative to the stand-alone reaction. Our results establish a basis for the development of a sustainable hydrogen-free continuous process for the production of high value alkenes/ketones using a non-noble copper catalyst."
