0,Introduction,"The present status of the maximum growth of energy is dependent on traditional resources like fossil fuels [1]. Day by day increasing demand for energy (as a fuel) and limitation of fossil fuels (petroleum, coal and natural gas), there is an essential requirement to make clean fuel and environmental friendly as the environment is very affected by air pollution [2]. The use of renewable energy becomes more important due to its alternative option to produce fuels as a form of energy and it focuses on making different technologies [3]. The climate issue and energy crisis have evoked a deep concern all over the world; speedy depletion of natural energy resources based of 80% is consumed from fossil fuel [4], besides searching for the new sources of energy, which must be clean, pollution free and renewable energy. The Present days, hydrogen gas introduces a potential energy source, attracting worldwide interest and having high content of energy (286 kJ per mol) [5]. Hydrogen is envisaged as alternative energy as a fuel carrier in the coming decades. It can replace the fossil fuels because of it having high potential, non– carbon-based, non-polluted and good symbol for the environment. Hydrogen energy is more gaining attention due to decrement of fossil fuel and increasing demand for energy [6]. It is having energy content/unit weight (142 kJ/g).It is safer and comfortable handling compare to other natural gases. After combustion, it produces energy and water vapors which is environmental friendly. These factors make the ideal condition for replacing fossil fuels. Now, H2 has been considered worldwide most alternative fossil fuel, safe fuel and pollution less. In the current scenario, hydrogen is developed by natural gases, naphtha and heavy oil, coal and electrolysis etc. Maximum H2 production (96%) is directly extracted by fossil fuels and nearly 4% H2 production indirectly way by using electricity from fossil fuel as feedstock, depicted in Fig. 1 .At present day, biomass is also becoming more favorable H2 production methods from the biological process due to the utilization of non-conventional recourses, and it uses at ambient temperature and pressure [7–8]. In this review paper, examine the existing industrial-based process and biological methods for H2 production. The aims of the work to focus on a comparative overviewed of H2 production methods mainly from hydrocarbon, biomass, and water using solar energy."
1,Present status of hydrogen production,"Most of researchers and specialists adopted that hydrogen holds excellent potential as energy in the future. Two factors, such as economic growth and industrialization of developing countries have been grown the world’s energy demand. Balat [10] reported the world H2 production was nearly 44.5 million tons per annum or 500 Bm3 by the end of the year 2008 and the estimated demand of energy will touch nearby 600-1000EJ up to 2050 [11]. Hosseini [11] reviewed the H2 fuel cell is favourable technology in future energy supply. Currently, resources of fossil fuel as coal, natural gas and crude oil provide approximately 80% of planetary energy demand [12]. It is assumed that consume petroleum in each day nearly 18.3 million barrels can replace hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles (car and light trucks) by the year 2040. It is also accepting that hydrogen-based powered vehicles are more efficient (2.5 times) of improved vehicles of gasoline and to full fill, the petroleum reduction would meet the requirement of hydrogen nearly 150 million by 2040. The overall net energy can save by the use of petroleum approximate 11 million barrels /day from all H2 production through petroleum reforming [13]. Rohland et al. [14] focused 36% shares from renewable resources by 2025 increased to world total energy 69% shares by 2050 from the same energy and 11% by 2025 grown to 34% from hydrogen up to 2050."
2,Hydrogen production from industrial process,"Many technologies are accessible for hydrogen generation by fossil fuels, but the mains are hydrocarbon reforming and most advanced methods [15].Various kinds of feedstock are available for H2 production on industrial bases but more ideal feed stock as input material is natural gas due to the availability of huge amount and beneficial price [16].There are also use some light alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, easy handling, and globally distributed [17]. There are some important techniques of hydrogen productions, as refer in Fig. 2"
3,Steam methane reforming (SMR),"3.1 Steam methane reforming (SMR) Steam reforming is a kind of technique to produce hydrogen through different feedstock like (higher hydrocarbon, acetone, ethanol, methanol, ethane and methane) with different catalysts. Methane is a more favourable feedstock to others because of better by-product formation [18].This technique can produce hydrogen in multiple stages, as shown in Fig. 3 . Steam methane reforming of natural gas is a well-established technology that is used to generate hydrogen with the presence of steam through the conversion of hydrocarbon and implemented the first industrial application of steam methane in 1930 [19]. The steam methane reforming process involves catalytically reforming or (syn-gas) production, gas purification or methanation and water gas shift. It is operated at a higher temperature range 700–900 °C with the endothermic process. The necessary chemical reaction of steam methane reforming as follows [20]. Reformer Equation (1) C H 4 + H 2 O ↔ 3 H 2 + C O Δ H = 206.2 K J / m o l a t 298 K Water gas shift reaction (2) C O + H 2 O ↔ H 2 + C O 2 Δ H = - 41.1 K J m o l a t 298 K Methanation reaction (3) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O ↔ 4 H 2 + C O 2 Δ H = - 164.9 K J m o l a t 298 K The reaction of water gas shift and reverse methanation are involved in a reaction of steam reforming over a catalyst at a higher temperature of more than 700 °C [20]."
4,Partial oxidation(POx),"3.2 Partial oxidation(POx) POx is another standard route to H2 production, which uses oxygen and hydrocarbon or methane fuel. The syngas (H2 + CO) and a mixture of CO2, N2, H2O, and a small amount of products such as methane are produced through partial oxidation. In a general way, oxidizing fuel is a requirement of energy balance in the presence of air. If sufficient air is not added, the fuel will oxidize incompletely, yielding mainly CO and H2. However, it provides the sufficient air yielding, mainly CO2 and H2O as well. However, if the air present becomes half, at that time the chemical equilibrium will predict the mixture of CO and H2, along with small traces of CO2 and H2O. The general equations are partial oxidation [21]. (4) C n H m + n 2 O 2 → n C O + m 2 H 2 (5) C H 4 + 1 2 O 2 ↔ C O + 2 H 2 Δ H = - 35 K J m o l a t 298 K Two-step reactions consist of partial oxidation of methane. In the first step reaction, total methane combustion in the presence of O2 to get CO2 and H2O. This is now followed by steam reforming of un-reacted methane and CO2 to receive syngas. The reaction accumulates with the reaction of water gas shift to obtain CO2 and H2O.The reactions of reforming are endothermic, however but total oxidation methane is an exothermic process ( Δ H = - 803 K J / m o l a t 298 ) [22]."
5,Auto thermal reforming(ATR),"3.3 Auto thermal reforming(ATR) This approach is combined with steam reforming and POx methods in an adiabatic reactor. This technique also provides the neutral reaction of pairing the endothermic as steam reforming and exothermic as partial oxidation. H2 yield is low than steam reforming, a better alternative option for fuel reforming due to neutral reaction in thermodynamically [23]. General equation: (6) C n H m + n 2 O 2 + n H 2 O → n + m 2 H 2 + n C O 2 ; Δ H 0 r e a c t i o n a p p r o x . t o z e r o Natural gas converted into a gas (H2 + CO) in the furnace of catalytic and then produced CO2 and H2 in catalytic shift reaction along with the water when CO reacts. CO2 can be captured through an absorption process by amines. Aqueous Amine solvent techniques are used for absorption of CO2 at industrial scale [24]."
6,Steam iron process,"3.4 Steam iron process This process is the old technique for H2 generation. This method is started in the 20th century and mainly for balloons and airships. This is also known as a conventional method in which produces the hydrogen from iron oxide and performed the temperature nearly 540°-900 °C [25]. It is a repeated process for H2O split by which oil and coal are utilized. This process is done to produce reducing gas by coal gasified and containing H2 and CO. This type of gas reacts by iron oxides like magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), and wuestite (FeO) to generate an iron oxide with reduced form [25]. The regenerated iron utilize in the reactor of the steam iron, consist of oxidized through steam to generate high abundant gas of H2 and Fe3O4 and touch the temperature nearly (1088 K-1143 K), represented by a chemical reaction. (7) 3 F e O + H 2 O → F e 3 O 4 + H 2 Steam iron reactor constitutes the small traces N2 and CO2 with 61% steam and 37% H2 and after condensation steam, improve H2 concentration nearly 96% with 1.6% CO2 and 2.5% N2 [26]."
7,Biological techniques of H2 production,"Hydrogen production is prepared by various methods of biological process. The biological process is an alternate technique of generating hydrogen and it is environmental friendly requires less energy-intensive and operated at atmospheric pressure and temperature [27]. Agriculture waste as raw material is the best promising candidate for the production of bio-fuels from anaerobic fermentation process [28]. Currently, the biomass is gaining more attention for hydrogen production and uses as waste material, cellulose, sucrose and starch but earlier used only glucose."
8,Dark fermentation,"4.1 Dark fermentation The fermentation process is done from anaerobic bacteria and green algae in dark conditions [29].It is conducted by a biochemical process that can be performed with and without the presence of O2 and obtained the CO2, acetone, alcohols and H2 by the performance of microbial transformation of organic material (feed material) [30]. Carbohydrate is a good example of glucose as organic carbon. As observed from equations no.8 and 9, glucose as biomass produces a 4 mol of hydrogen in each mol of glucose when acetic acid (CH3COOH) is the fermentation by-product and 2 mol of hydrogen in each mol of glucose can be produced as the butyrate acid (CH3CH2CH2COOH) is the fermentation by-product [31]. (8) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 C H 3 C O O H + 2 C O 2 (9) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 H 2 + C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 C O 2 Formation of hydrogen from dark fermentation depends on important parameters such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), PH value and gaseous partial pressure. PH value must be maintained in between ranges 5 to 6 for the optimal H2 production [32]."
9,Photo-Fermentation,"4.2 Photo-Fermentation This is the process of biochemical that is conducted using organic acid and solar energy under deficient nitrogen. Photosynthetic bacteria can convert organic acids like butyric, lattice and acetic into CO2 and H2 with the presence of nitrogenase [33]. For example, photosynthetic non-sulfur (PNS) bacteria have capable of converting volatile fatty acid s (VFAS) into CO2 and H2 with the presence of an oxygenic conditions [34]. For hydrogen production, carbon sources such as sucrose glucose, succinate instead of VFA can also be capable of PNS bacteria [35]. When the acidic acid of fermentation medium, 1 mol of acetic acid generated 4 mol of H2 as presented in Eq. (10). Ref. [36] (10) C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 O → L i g h t 4 H 2 + 2 C O 2 Δ G O = + 104 K J"
10,Hybrid system,4.3 Hybrid system It is a group arrangement approach of both photo and dark fermentation from biological wastes. It is adopted as a complete conversion process compares to other processes. This system can produce a maximum yield of H2 generation and less requirement of light energy. The system is referring in Fig. 4 [37]. Hydrogen can produce from dark conditions using anaerobic bacteria with different carbohydrates and comes out organic acid as a source for bacteria of photosynthetic to obtain additional production of hydrogen [38].The hybrid system is also known as two-stage process and sequential order of dark-fermentation process. These stages are represented by equations as follows [39]. (11) D a r k F e r m e n t a t i o n ( S t a g e I ) : C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 2 C H 3 C O O H + 4 H 2 (12) P h o t o f e r m e n t a t i o n ( S t a g e I I ) : 2 C H 3 C O O H + 4 H 2 → L i g h t 4 C O 2 + 8 H 2 (13) O v e r a l l r e a c t i o n : C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 12 H 2 + 6 C O 2
11,Bio-photolysis,"4.4 Bio-photolysis Bio-photolysis is utilized during the photosynthesis process using the ability of plants (mainly algae) to dissociate water. It is also a biological process in which split of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen presence of sunlight using isolated photosynthetic membrane and other catalysts. This process is mainly decomposition of water using photons with biological catalysts, known as photolysis of water. It is two categories of bio photolysis: Direct and indirect. 4.4.1 Direct bio-photolysis This process is used microalgae (green algae with cyanobacteria) through the presence of solar energy. It consists of photosynthetic reactions where as water is transformed into hydrogen represented by a general reaction [37]. (14) 2 H 2 O + L i g h t e n e r g y → O 2 + 2 H 2 Green algae dissociate water (H2O) molecules into hydrogen ions along with oxygen ions during photosynthesis. Anabaena cylindrica is an excellent example of cyanobacteria for direct bio-photolysis [40]. 4.4.1.1 Indirect bio-photolysis This process is done in 2 steps; the first step occurs with photosynthesis which generates glucose with O2 while in the second step, CO2 and H2 are generated through glucose along with water and the general reactions as follows [37]. (15) 12 H 2 O + 6 C O 2 + S o l a r e n e r g y → 6 O 2 + C 6 H 12 O 6 (16) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 12 H 2 O + S o l a r e n e r g y → 6 C O 2 + 12 H 2 Hydrogenase and nitrogenase are both responsible for hydrogen formation but more production rate of hydrogenase enzymes by green algae [41]. The process of indirect bio-photolysis is explained as shown in Fig. 5 [37]."
12,Overall summary of hydrogen methods,"In this section, comparative assessment on the bases of data of various kinds of H2 production methods has been discussed. The performance evaluation of H2 production, both technically and economically, are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . These methods are highly matured and developed and already exist. They are provided the advantages, disadvantages and efficiency on the bases of hydrocarbon and renewable energy sources (Table 1). Biomass is renewable, abundant feed material and readily available in the environment. Biological processes generate low yield and need a larger volume reactor. The total cost of H2 production methods depend on feedstock, source of energy and capital investment, included in Table 2. Low price of fuel such as coal and natural gas, more efficient as they were using feedstock, conventional techniques are producing H2 at a low cost nearly 2 US$/Kg, as depicted in Table 1. H2 production cost/kg considering and without considering CCS ranges 1.34–2.27US$. Production of hydrogen methods presents with their efficiency and its feedstock, refer table 1. Reforming technologies are most mature and reach efficiency up to 85% for SMR and followed by POx and ATR nearly 75%. The main outlines of the above section are renewable technologies become more competitive, its related cost and need more research to develop a more efficient manner of hydrogen generation."
13,Economic aspect,"5.1 Economic aspect Hay et al. [45] analyzed the production of H2 from an economical source such as coal and natural gas comprise 0.37–1.82 USD per kg and 2.48–3.15 USD per kg. However, the cost is high as of wind and solar energy. It is assumed that using biomass or waste materials as energy sources can be reduced to H2 production. In between the year of 2011–2016, globally hydrogen production was evaluated to expand through the compound yearly increase the rate of 5.6% and accepted that generation of H2 market will raise nearly USD 87.3 billion up to 2011 to USD 118 billion up to 2016 using by means of CAGR of 6.21% [45]. Kalamara [46] presented a most favourable and an inexpensive method for production of H2 is SMR (natural gas). The price of H2 is nearly 7USD/GJ and this approach is used more than half of globally H2 production. Hydrogen generation from biomass using pyrolysis and gasification obtain H2 prices more than 3 times higher compared to H2 prices produced by SMR process. H2 price from biomass gasification and pyrolysis estimated ranges from 10 to 14 US$ per GJ and 8.91–5.51 US$ per GJ. Its dependency on feedstock cost, accessibility and equipment [47]."
14,Hydrogen storage,"A storage device of H2 is an essential part and a big task of hydrogen storage for the use of a large scale. Hydrogen has high energy density and low energy density by weight and volume respectively, with the comparison to hydrocarbon [48]. The storage parameter such as gravimeter and volumetric should be higher for the devices of hydrogen storage. The material for H2 storage device is low cost, lightweight, suitable kinetic of desorption, adsorption, and recyclability. The U.S. DOE (Department of Energy) 2015 goals are the capacity of 40 g H2/litre and 5.5 wt% and 1500 cycles of a lifetime [49]. 1 kg of H2 occupies 11 m3 volume at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature with a lower density 0.09 kg/m3 [50]. Hydrogen is store in a gaseous state at ambient temperature but in the liquid state need the lowest temperature (-253 °C or 20 K) using vacuum insulated vessel. The main important methods of H2 can be stored physically, such as gas under pressure, cryogenic liquid state and frozen (solid) fuel like metal hydrides (combine physical and chemical). Highly pressurized gaseous H2 storage is a familiar and fully grown technique as a result of its technically simple and high rate of filling, require approximate higher pressure (77 MPa) using mechanical compressor (piston-type) [51].However, the work requirement of compression is higher than 2.21 KWh/kg, consisting of gravimeter (13 wt%) and volumetric density (less than 40 kg/m3) [52]. Cryogenic tank uses for storage of hydrogen in liquid form by two steps through compression and cooling process in H.E. (Heat Exchanger). Liquid H2 has a low boiling point, then the work required for compressor is nearly 15.2 kWh/kg; collecting volumetric density (at atm. pressure) is 70.8 kg/m3 but the parameter gravimeter density depends on size of the tank [51]. H2 storage in solid state is more effective at moderate pressure, temperature and stored by adsorption (on a solid surface). In the adsorption process, when several atoms of solid surface interacted by gas molecules, it bonded and released in reverse order. A low temperate 77 K and pressure 6 MPa, stored hydrogen by carbon nanotubes and providing volumetric density (10.8 wt%) and gravimeter (41 kg/m3) [52]. There are various metals used for storing hydrogen. Magnesium is adopted as attractive material because of lightweight, lower cost, and high capacity and it stores H2 (7.6 wt%) [53]. Metals (lightweight) as Li, Al, B, Mg, Na and Be, a huge variety of compound metal hydrogen [51]. Metal hybrids such as NaBH4, Ca2H, LiH, MgH2 and LIAlH4 studied of storage materials for H2 gas to fuel-cell. Best material such as NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) is used for high stability, safety purpose and higher storage capacity (10.8 wt%). However, react with water without using any catalyst and not stability in the air to generate hydrogen [54]. Most of the industries apply policy of H2 need superior package, transportation and storage as of production site to the users. Thus, research requires for hydrogen storage material is safe, commercial and reliable. There is an important criterion for H2 storage as the reversibility of uptake and release. Therefore, the reversibility criteria excepts the entire covalent and associated compound of hydrogen carbon because hydrogen is just released if it is heated at high temperature more than 800 °C, otherwise the carbon is oxidized [50]."
15,Conclusions,"In the development of hydrogen production, a tremendous amount of research is going on due to more reasons like its clean, high energy content, safe energy, and produced from different kinds of recourses such as fossil fuel, renewable other sustainability energy. Presently, Hydrocarbon reforming techniques are more used and developed for hydrogen production. Several researchers have been done the more works on bio-hydrogen using water and biomass along with solar energy, but still it continues to improve the efficiency of development. This review paper analyzed the developments in conventional techniques used by an industrial process, leading enhancement of H2 production and biological processes described by non-conventional techniques, promising methods for producing H2 from some advantages such as biomass, plenteous, cleanly and renewable source. The collection of industrial techniques are involve in different kind of reforming process such as steam methane reformation (SMR), Partial oxidation (POx), auto thermal reforming (ATR) and steam iron. Some other biological techniques of H2 production are adopted by various developing processes such as dark fermentation, photo fermentation, and bio-photolysis by direct and indirect. The reforming techniques are most efficient and mostly used for H2 production. Steam methane reforming (SMR) achieved nearly 85% and also reached around 75% by partial oxidation (POx) and auto thermal reforming (ATR) process. The reforming processes are not new methods, but these are the most efficient. Due to dependency on fossil fuels, developing alternate techniques of H2 production are necessary. Some techniques of H2 production are adopted by various developing processes such as the biological process is one of them. The biological procedure is producing low yields but gaining more interest due to easy and large availability of feed materials and low pollutions. Since H2 can be developed by various kind of renewable sources and efforts in minimal global warming, a lot of research work, introduced the whole world to make methods of H2 production efficient more and more. Still, H2 productions of conventional techniques are more attractive and economically, though non-conventional techniques are fields of scientific research. There are two main factors such as increasing ecological issues as well as the cost of energy. Bio-fuels are generating more interest in the development of H2 production fields. Bio- H2 production methods economy is more expensive than fossil fuel H2 production. The requirement of more research challenges the yields of bio-H2 to provide practical solutions. The economic analysis point of view reuses of waste areas feed material illustrated the sustainability of commercialization bio-hydrogen, on the other hand, storage of H2 is a big major issue, presented immediately to process utilization of H2 fuel, and needs research to the improvement of gravimetric and volumetric density."
