0,Introduction,"Numerous methods and feed stocks for hydrogen production have been explored in recent decades, since hydrogen meets the basic requirements as a green energy source – it has the highest heating value and it is environmentally friendly. As a rule, hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons by different conversion processes such as steam reforming, partial oxidation, CO2 reforming, and pyrolysis [1,2]. The use of plasmas has already been recognized as a feasible alternative to conventional reforming methods [3–8]. Acting as a thermo-chemical reactor, plasmas overcome many peculiar problems of catalytic reformers such as short lifetime of expensive catalysts, sluggish time response, etc. Various types of plasma reactors have been used for hydrocarbon reforming, viz., dielectric barrier discharge [9,10], gliding arc discharge [11–13], corona discharge [14,15], pulsed discharge [16,17], microwave discharge [18,19], radio-frequency discharge [20], and various hybrid discharges. Moreover, several plasma reactors have specifically been designed for reforming purposes [21]. Non-thermal plasmas are preferable when compared with the thermal ones due to the lower power consumption. They also benefit from a high reactivity and selectivity, thus providing high conversion efficiency. Among the advantages of non-thermal plasmas are their operation at lower temperatures than in traditional reforming systems, fast time response due to electrical feeding and versatile operation with a broad range of feed stocks such as natural gas, gasoline, heavy oils, alcohols, and bio-fuels [21]. Moreover, plasma techniques are usually environmentally clean processes since they are not primary greenhouse gas emitters. Pollutants emission into the atmosphere can be avoided because the plasma decomposes efficiently all the complex nocuous molecules peculiar to conventional technologies. In fact, the global CO2 emission balance can be reduced to zero if renewable feed stocks (bioethanol, methanol) are used and the feeding electricity comes from renewable energy sources. In this context, microwave generated plasmas at atmospheric pressure attract much attention due to their advantages as compared with those created by electrode- based DC and RF discharges. These advantages can be summarized as follows: microwave discharges enable a better energy transfer to the plasma, thus enhancing the production of high ionization and dissociation levels; the reaction vessels are simpler, without internal electrodes, and allow high-throughput atmospheric processing; the microwave-plasma coupling efficiency is nearly 100%; absence of high DC voltages; potentially, lower power consumption; and availability of inexpensive microwave sources at 2.45 GHz [22]. Due to the effective power dissipation, microwave discharges provide high densities of active species of interest, such as free radicals and atoms, which can promote numerous reactions. Various microwave-based plasmas have already been applied as hydrocarbon reformers [18,19,23–33]. In Refs. [23,24], the reforming behavior of n-hexane and isooctane was studied in pure steam microwave plasma at atmospheric pressure. The results show production of H2, but the conversion of the fuel was not sufficient. Surface wave discharges were used in Ref. [25] for ethanol and ethanol-water decomposition, although working at reduced pressure. The same specific type of discharge was tested by Calzada et al. [18] for reforming of different alcohols. The by-products detected were H2, C2 and CH. In a series of works, Mizeraczyk et al. [26–29] investigated the conversion of CH4 under high flow rates into hydrogen-rich gas by employing microwave plasmas. CH4 and C2H2F4 have been introduced into the plasma using swirl flow conditions and better parameters for hydrogen yield and energetic hydrogen mass yield were obtained [29]. Steam reforming of methane for hydrogen production was also studied in Ref. [30] using a microwave plasma reactor. Recently, the reforming of renewable hydrocarbon feed stocks have intensively been studied owing to environmental concerns [8–11,16–19,25,33–36]. Moreover, the use of liquid alcohols as reforming substances is suitable for portable applications and eliminates the safety concerns associated with gases [37–39]. In this study, a surface wave driven microwave plasma operating at atmospheric pressure has been applied for reforming of methanol to produce hydrogen rich gas stream. The plasma is created under vortex flow conditions using Ar as a carrier gas and mixtures of Ar/water with methanol. In order to create a vortex gas flow a swirl injection system is used. Mass spectrometry (MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) have been applied to detect molecular hydrogen and other by-products of methanol decomposition. The effect of water vapor on the hydrogen yield has been analyzed. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) has been applied to detect the emission of plasma radiative species. To this end, the emission of argon/methanol/water vapor plasma in the 230–750 nm spectral range has been investigated. The gas temperature axial profile in the discharge zone has been determined by measuring the rotational distribution of the Q1 branch of the OH ( A 2 Σ + , v = 0 → X 2 Π i , v ′ = 0 ) band. Stark broadening of the Hα (656.3 nm) spectral line has been used to determine the electron density. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis of the methanol decomposition in the argon plasma environment has been performed on the basis of a kinetic model which was developed for this purpose. This model, similar to that of Chemkin 4 [40], predicts the axial distribution of the species population densities along the discharge and its afterglow. The theoretical results have been compared with the experimental ones."
1,Experimental setup,"Fig. 1 shows the scheme of the experimental setup used. Microwave power up to 2 kW at 2.45 MHz is provided by a generator (Sairem). The generator is coupled to a waveguide (WR-340) system and is equipped with incident and reflected power meters. The waveguide consists of a water-cooled circulator, directional couplers, a 3-stub tuner and a waveguide surfatron originally designed by Moisan et al. (not shown on the figure) [41]. A moveable short-circuit allows for impedance matching so that a maximum electric field is achieved at the launcher position. The discharge ignites in a quartz tube with internal and external radii of 7.5 and 9 mm, respectively, placed vertically and perpendicularly to the waveguide wider wall. The output microwave power was kept at 450 W. The total Ar flow was 1000 sccm and the methanol flow rates were determined by calibration. The background gas consists of premixed Ar (purity of 99.999%), water vapor and methanol. A bubbling system has been used to introduce the mixture into the discharge. For this purpose, the Ar flux passes through a methanol filled tank (Q Ar/Methanol) at room temperature as shown in Fig. 1. Bubbling is also used when additional water vapor is introduced into the plasma (Q Ar/Water). The amount of water vapor in the background gas was controlled by the water temperature. Finally, the total gas flow introduced into the discharge tube is the combination of all the above fluxes (Fig. 1). The hydrogen production rate was obtained by calibration of the mass analyzer with pure hydrogen gas (99.999%). The discharge is sustained under vortex-type flow conditions, which are provided by a swirl system (Fig. 2 a). The latter consists of two tangential inlet nozzles, which create helical-shaped motion of the gas inside the plasma tube, with higher velocity near the walls. The background gases Ar and water vapor as well as the alcohol are introduced into the quartz tube using the swirl system, thus providing better gas mixing and better cooling at the same time. The vortex flow stabilizes the plasma torch along the tube axis and confines it to the center, especially at relatively high gas flow rates (Fig. 2). A Jobin-Yvon Spex 1250 optical spectrometer (diffraction grating 2400 gr/mm) equipped with a liquid-nitrogen cooled CCD (2048 × 512 matrix) camera has been used for the OES measurements. An optical fiber, pointed perpendicularly to the quartz tube, collected the light emitted by the plasma. A portion of the output gas from the plasma reactor was directed to a Stanford Research System RGA 200 mass analyzer and to an FT-IR Termo Nicolet 5700 spectrometer. The latter detected the absorption spectra of the species in the wave number range 1000–4000 cm−1."
2,Theoretical model,"An inherent difficulty encountered in developing a reliable model for reforming of methanol in the argon-plasma environment under analysis is that one must solve a highly nonlinear coupled set of spatially dependent differential equations. For the sake of simplicity, the present model is 1D, i.e., only axial variations are considered, and local thermal equilibrium is assumed. A kinetic scheme similar to that presented in Ref. [42] is used. The present scheme includes 28 components of methanol fragmentation and about 300 chemical reactions, which are presented in Table 1 . Considering the extended temperature range under the present conditions (up to 3500 K) the rate constants of the processes given in Ref. [42] have been corrected by interpolating the values in the required temperature range. The thermodynamic data of the processes were taken from available thermodynamic bases [40,43–46]. The expressions for the rate constants in the extended temperature range have been validated with available data in the literature [43,47–51]. The rate balance equations for the decomposition products were solved altogether with the gas thermal balance equation. The electromagnetic power absorbed by the electrons heats the gas via elastic collisions and excitation of rotational and vibrational molecular levels. The excited molecules are subsequently deactivated in collisions with atoms and other molecules. The gas temperature T(r) has a maximum in the center of the tube and decreases toward the walls. We assume its profile has a parabolic shape of the form T ( r ) = ( T a − T w ) ( 1 − ( r R ) 2 ) + T w , where T a is the temperature at the axis, T w is the wall temperature and R is the tube radius. We further assume that the main thermal losses are due to the radial heat conduction so that they can be expressed as 1 r ∂ ∂ r ( r χ ( T ) ∂ T ∂ r ) | r → R ≈ − 4 R 2 χ ( T ) ( T a − T w ) , where χ is the argon thermal conductivity. Therefore, under the assumptions considered the gas thermal balance equation can be expresses by the equation c p p 0 V 0 k B T 0 ⅆ T a ⅆ z = − 4 χ ( T ) R 2 ( T a − T w ) + δ S ⅆ P ⅆ z Here V 0 is the gas velocity, T 0 is the initial gas temperature, p 0 is the gas pressure, K B is the Boltzmann's constant, c p is the heat capacity at constant pressure, δ is the fraction of the absorbed wave power which is transferred to thermal energy of the gas, S is the plasma cross-section and P is the absorbed microwave power. It has been assumed that the microwave power is linearly dissipated along the plasma column length of about 2.5 cm. We have further assumed that δ ≈ 0.9, which is a typical value for atmospheric pressure conditions. The measured wall temperature axial profile has been fitted by an analytical expression and was used as external parameter in the numerical calculations [52]. The fact that the gas temperature is radially inhomogeneous has a strong influence on the spatial dependence of the rate coefficients for reactions with high activation energy, E a . In fact, the rate coefficients with an exponential dependence on temperature ( k = A T n exp ( − E a / R gas T ) ) strongly vary with radial position. In order to account for this effect in the framework of a 1D model, the rate coefficients have been radially averaged for every axial position z along the discharge tube. Thus, effective rate coefficients k eff calculated as k eff = 2 R 2 ∫ 0 R k ( T ) r ⅆ r = 2 A R 2 ∫ 0 R T ( r ) n exp ( − E a T ( r ) ) r ⅆ r have been used. The system of equations described above was solved in a self-consistent manner yielding an integral description of the axial structure of the discharge and post discharge regions as well as of the outlet gas stream. The algorithm used for the calculations is similar to that of the well-known computer code Chemkin 4 [40]. The equilibrium values of the stable substances (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon oxide, water and methanol) and intermediate complexes along the discharge are useful to understand the general workings of methanol decomposition. Calculations of the corresponding equilibrium molar fractions are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the temperature. As seen, practically 100% conversion of methanol is achieved in the temperature range 2500–3000 K at the pressure of 1 atm. Some co-products such as methane, water and carbon dioxide are obtained as a result of following globally distributed scheme: 6CH3OH → 4CH4 + 3H2O + H2 + CO + CO2. The mechanism of methanol decomposition is quite similar to that of the methanol combustion process. Firstly, methanol decomposes into complex radicals such as CH3, CH3O, CH2OH and CH2 due to interactions with Ar atoms [42]. Then, these radicals can recombine with each other, and form stable low molecular weight molecules, such as H2O, CO2, and CH4. However, at the higher temperatures the complex radicals decompose into simple complexes (H2, CO, H, OH), due to their interaction with H, OH and O radicals. As seen from Fig. 3, an increased content of free radicals and atomic species is observed at temperatures higher than 3500–4000 K."
3,Results and discussion,"The measurement of the hydrogen yield vs. the alcohol flow rate is a forthright method to determine the conversion efficiency of methanol into hydrogen rich gas. Different definitions of the hydrogen yield and the fuel conversion rate can be found in the literature. In this work, we adopt the following definitions for the hydrogen yield Y H 2 and the alcohol conversion rate C alc [11]: (1) Y H 2 = ( produced H 2 flow rate n 1 × initial alcohol flow rate + n 2 × initial water flow rate ) × 100 % (2) C alc = ( 1 − alcohol flow rate in the exhaust gas initial alcohol flow rate ) × 100 % The coefficient n in equation (1) is the maximum number of hydrogen molecules that can be obtained from a single alcohol molecule. In the case of methanol, n 1 = 2 and for water n 2 = 1. As the experimental results obtained by mass spectroscopy demonstrate, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are the main species of methanol decomposition in the argon plasma environment. The presence of other species is negligible and has not been detected. The time evolution of the H2 and CO partial pressures in the effluent gas stream as the methanol flow rate is successively increased is presented in Fig. 4 . As seen, the partial pressure of H2 increases substantially with the methanol flow while that of CO also shows some small increase. The hydrogen production rate is shown in Fig. 5a as a function of the methanol flow rate. The expected theoretical dependence according to the reaction (R1) CH3OH → 2H2 + CO is also shown in this figure, along with the experimental results. The hydrogen yield dependence on the methanol flow rate is shown in Fig. 5b . As can be seen from Fig. 5b, the hydrogen yield is close to 100% for methanol flow rates in the range 5–10 sccm. The contribution of the steam reforming reaction to the hydrogen yield has been investigated by introducing a small quantity of water vapor into the discharge. To this end, the Ar flow passes through a water tank as shown in Fig. 1. The change of the hydrogen production rate when water is added to the total (argon + methanol) flux is shown in Fig. 6 . Steam reforming of methanol proceeds through the reaction (R2) CH3OH + H2O → 3H2 + CO2. Therefore, the contribution of steam reforming results in an increase of the H2 yield (Fig. 6) by nearly a factor of 1.5 as it is shown in Table 2 . Simultaneously, according to the FT-IR measurements an increase in the CO2 amount is also detected (see Fig. 8 below). It should be noted that by using the “tornado”-type reactor nearly the same hydrogen production rate as in the case of laminar gas flow conditions can be obtained at lower feeding power, i.e., higher energetic hydrogen mass yield is achieved (see Table 3 ). As it can be seen from the results shown in Table 3, the energetic hydrogen mass yield increases by ∼10–20% when “vortex” gas flow is used instead of the laminar one. A comparison with the results obtained in the previous work (Ref. [19]) has been made. The detected infrared spectrum of the outlet gas stream before and after the microwave plasma is turned on is shown in Fig. 7 . The spectrum is detected in the 1000–4000 cm−1 wave number range at total Ar flow of 1000 sccm, microwave power of 450 W and methanol partial flow of 9.7 sccm (Q Ar/Methanol = 9%). The blue and black lines are the spectra detected with and without plasma, respectively. The methanol spectral signatures at around 1200–1400, 2100, 3000 and 3700 cm−1 are present only when the plasma reactor is turned off. This clearly indicates that the methanol molecules are practically all decomposed in the argon plasma environment. Simultaneously, the absorption peak of CO at about 2170 cm−1 is also detected, as expected from reaction (R1). The changes in the infrared spectra of the plasma outlet gas stream in the range 1600–2500 cm−1 when water vapor is introduced into the discharge are shown in Fig. 8. It is observed that adding water vapor leads to a decrease of the CO peak (at 2170 cm−1) and an increase of the CO2 (at 2349 cm−1) one. As a result of the steam reforming reaction (R2) an additional hydrogen molecule is produced and the CO2 amount increases. It this case, the methanol decomposition by reaction (R1) is followed by the water–gas shift reaction (R3) CO + H2O → H2 + CO2 and carbon monoxide is almost entirely removed. The theoretical results for the axial variation of the gas temperature and gas composition are presented in Fig. 9 . The reference point L = 0 corresponds to the swirl injector position. Outside of the launcher the gas temperature is almost constant, with a value of about 3500 K, along the discharge zone but sharply decreases in the afterglow plasma jet and approaches room temperature in the outlet gas stream. Since the methanol decomposition process is thermally dependent, the resulting stable species concentrations exhibit noticeable axial variations. Methanol decomposition begins at temperatures of about 1200–1500 K (at about L = 0.5 cm). Basic components of methanol decomposition in this segment are H2, CO, CH2O, CH4 and H2O. With the further increase in temperature CH2O, CH4 and H2O are additionally decomposed into CO and H2. There are some negligible amounts of H2O, CO2 and light hydrocarbon fragments (CH3, CH4, CH2O), with relative populations less than 10−3 along the discharge, as seen from the figure. In the outlet gas stream the gas temperature reaches an equilibrium value close to the room temperature. Here, the main products of the decomposition are H2 and CO as detected experimentally and the theoretical results demonstrate. The good agreement between the theoretical and experimental (mass spectroscopy) values of the H2 and CO molar fractions shown in the figure is to be noticed."
4,Argon/methanol plasma characteristics,"As seen from Fig. 2, the argon/methanol discharge exhibits a contracted conical shape and emits violet light. The detected emission spectrum in the 2400–7500 Å range is shown in Fig. 10 , for the same operational conditions as in the previous experiments, i.e., P = 450 W and Q t = 1000 sccm. The flow Q Methanol was kept at 4.7 sccm. Emissions from radiative molecular and atomic species such as CN (violet system, B2Σ → X 2Σ), C2 (Swan system, between 4500 and 5700 Å, A 3Πg → X ′3Πu), OH (A 2Σ+, υ = 0 → X 2Πi, υ′ = 0), NH (3360 Å system, A 3Π → X 3Σ−1), C (2479 Å) and the hydrogen Balmer-alpha line (6563 Å) were detected. The discharge operates in open atmosphere and radiative species containing nitrogen such as CN and NH can be detected. CN species are formed due to the three-body recombination reaction [18]: C + N + Ar → CN∗ (B2∑) + Ar The emission spectrum of the OH (A–X) transition provides a convenient way to determine the rotational temperature. The collision rates in the plasma at atmospheric pressure are high enough to ensure local thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, the rotational temperature can be considered nearly equal to the gas kinetic temperature. The OH spectra of the argon/methanol plasma in the range 3060–3150 Å have been detected along the discharge as well as at different partial methanol flow rates. Using the intensity of the OH emission lines and the classical Boltzmann plot method, the rotational temperature was estimated. The gas temperature values measured at the axial distance z = 0.6 cm from the launcher increase linearly, from 3100 K to 3600 K, when the methanol flow rate increases in the range 4.8–12.2 sccm. The temperature slowly decreases when moving away from the launcher, as expected. Stark broadening of the Balmer-alpha line (see Fig. 11 ) has been measured to estimate the electron density. To this end, the Hα line profile has been fitted by a Voigt profile (Fig. 11). A deconvolution procedure has been used to determine the full width at half-maximum of the Gaussian (Δλ G) and Lorentzian (Δλ L) components. Stark and van der Waals effects contribute to the Lorentzian broadening under the present conditions. Assuming that Ar atoms are the main perturbers, the following expression for van der Waals broadening Δλ van der Waals of Hα has been used [56]: Δλ van der Waals = 3.5·p·T g −0.7, Here, p is the gas pressure in atmospheres and T g is the gas temperature in Kelvin degrees. For gas temperatures in the range 2900–3100 K, the estimated van der Waals broadening is within the limits 0.126–0.131 Å. The latter has been deconvoluted from the Lorentzian full width at half maximum. The electron density has been calculated using the following expression [57]: Δλ Stark = 1.0 × 10−11·N e −0.649, where N e is the electron density in cm−3 and Δλ Stark is the Stark broadening width in nm. This expression is derived from a fit of the widths computed by Gigosos et al. [58] for a reduced mass μ = 0.976. The latter corresponds to the present emitter – perturber conditions, i.e., the pair hydrogen – argon. The calculated values of electron density are ∼ 2.0 × 1014 cm−3 for Q t = 1000 sccm, Q Methanol = 3.5 sccm and P = 450 W, while with a small addition of water N e ∼ 8.2 × 1014 cm−3. These density values correspond to the axial part of the discharge, from where most of the detected radiation is emitted."
5,Conclusions,"A microwave, “tornado”-type plasma, with swirl injection of the background gas, operating at 2.45 GHz and atmospheric pressure has been used to decompose methanol in argon and argon-water vapor plasma environments. The vortex gas flow “detaches” the hot plasma core from the wall and stable operation of the plasma source has been achieved due to the gas swirl injection. Methanol and water vapor have been introduced into the discharge by passing argon gas through the alcohol and water containing tanks. Mass spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy have been applied to detect molecular hydrogen, carbon oxide and carbon dioxide as the main products of the methanol reforming process. The performed study of the hydrogen yield dependence on the partial methanol flow shows that this yield is almost 100% for methanol fluxes in the range 5–10 sccm. It has also been found that the hydrogen yield increases by nearly factor of 1.5 when water is added into the plasma. We ascribe this fact to the water-gas shift reaction. It should be noted that by using “tornado”-type reactor nearly the same hydrogen production rate as in the case of laminar gas flow conditions can be obtained at lower feeding power, i.e., higher energetic hydrogen mass yield is achieved. Furthermore, optical emission spectroscopy has been applied to determine the gas temperature, the electron density and the radiative species present in the plasma. A theoretical model based on a set of rate balance equations describing the chemical kinetics and the gas thermal balance has been developed. The theoretical results on the decomposition products agree well with the experiment, confirming that the microwave plasma decomposition of methanol is a temperature dependent process and that methanol mainly decomposes into H2 and CO under the conditions considered. The present results clearly show that this type of plasma is an efficient tool for methanol reforming and hydrogen production. Further optimization of the reforming process to increase the hydrogen yield by using gases like nitrogen and changing the background and partial flow rates is in progress."
