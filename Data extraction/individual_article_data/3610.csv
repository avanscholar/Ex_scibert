0,Introduction,"In recent years, hydrogels featuring three-dimensional hydrophilic networks have been extensively studied, and especially smart hydrogels have attracted special attention due to their versatility, such as self-healing properties, reversible sol-gel conversion or color change in response to external stimuli (Bian, Jiao et al., 2018; Bian, Wei et al., 2018; Niu, Chen, & Liu, 2019; Ozay & Ozay, 2013; Tie et al., 2019; Wang, Tao, & Pan, 2016; Zhou et al., 2020). Self-healing is desirable to automatically restore the damaged hydrogel to its original state through dynamically reversible bonds (such as hydrogen bond or dynamic covalent bond), extending the lifetime and reducing the cost. The sol-gel conversion or color change of hydrogel can be used to intelligently monitor changes in the external environment (Lee & Lee, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). These intelligent behaviors broaden the application range of hydrogels, such as biological tissues, bioelectronics, drug release and sensor. At present, various polymers have been used to construct hydrogels, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogels are widely investigated due to their non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, water-solubility, simple-preparation and low-cost (Dai, Huang, & Huang, 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Yu, Shu, & Ye, 2018). However, the mechanical property of hydrogels including PVA hydrogel is considered to be a weakness because of its soft and brittle nature (Bian, Jiao et al., 2018; Bian, Wei et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019; Shao, Chang, Wang, Xu, & Yang, 2017). Therefore, smart hydrogels with good mechanical property are expected. To date, a lot of efforts have been devoted to reinforcing hydrogels, and the introduction of nanofillers to hydrogels was thought to be an effective way to improve their mechanical properties. In addition to graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, clay and metallic particles, increasing interest has focused on bio-based cellulose materials to strengthen the hydrogels as cellulose is hydrophilic, renewable, biodegradable and modifiable (Han, Lei, & Wu, 2014; Tanpichai & Oksman, 2016; Tummala, Joffre, Rojas, Persson, & Mihranyan, 2017; Yue et al., 2016). Lu et al. (2016) dispersed finely milling microfibrillated cellulose in PVA/borax substrate to improve the mechanical properties of self-healing hydrogel. Jing et al. (2019) prepared a cross-linked double network enhanced self-healing hydrogel by introducing cellulose nanofibril-calcium ion complexation into PVA/borax matrix. Shao et al. (2019) embedded tannic acid-coated cellulose nanocrystal into PVA/borax matrix to obtain a self-healing hydrogel with high tensile strength and adhesion strength. As a fascinating bio-based material, cellulose is used not only to reinforce hydrogels but also to construct intelligent hydrogels with different functions due to the presence of readily reactive hydroxyl groups in cellulose (Rol, Belgacem, Gandini, & Bras, 2019; Wang, Lu, & Zhang, 2016). Currently, a lot of stimuli-responsive chromogenic cellulose (such as photochromic, thermochromic or acidochromic cellulose) have been prepared by chemical modification, while few studies have used these stimuli-responsive cellulose to make color-tunable PVA hydrogels (Chauhan et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2018; Zhang, Ji, Yin, & Wang, 2019). Color-tunable PVA hydrogels have been constructed with quantum dots and lanthanide in the literatures (Yang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2014). We show here, for the first time smart PVA hydrogel with integrated mechanical reinforcement, self-healing and tunable color could be prepared by combining PVA with chromogenic cellulose materials. In this work, a self-healing and color-tunable smart hydrogel was reinforced by incorporating acidochromic regenerated cellulose (ARC) into PVA and borax hydrogel (Fig. 1 ). Typically, the ARC was prepared by introducing acidochromic dye to regenerated cellulose (RC), then the reversible didiol-borax bond and hydrogen bond were formed between ARC, PVA and borax crosslinker to make tough multifunctional hydrogel. The resulting smart hydrogel was investigated by FT-IR, SEM, TGA, optical images, UV–vis spectra, mechanical analysis and rheological analysis. These results showed that the tensile and compressive strengths of PB/ARC hydrogel increased by 580 % and 130 %, it was able to self-heal rapidly within 15 s, its color varied between yellow and purple at different pH values and its state also changed between sol and gel under different acidity or alkalinity. Therefore, this work provides a new, simple and low-cost method to construct multifunctional smart hydrogel, which has great potentials in the applications of color sensors, reusable flexible materials and smart drug delivery systems."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cotton cellulose fibers (length 0.2–1.0 mm, diameter 0.01−0.02 mm) were from Hua Fang Co., Ltd, China. Phosphoric acid (85 %) and 1-naphthol were obtained from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. 4-(ethylsulfurate sulfonyl) aniline (ESA) was purchased from Hubei Chushengwei Chemical Co., Ltd, China. Sodium nitrite (NaNO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 1750 ± 50) were used as received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetic acid and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O) were supplied by Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without any purification."
3,Preparation of ARC suspension,"2.2 Preparation of ARC suspension ARC suspension was prepared according to our previous reported literature (Ding et al., 2020). Cotton cellulose fibers (2 g) were wetted with water (18 mL) for 30 min and then precooled phosphoric acid (300 mL, 85 %) was added and stirred for 24 h at 4 °C to dissolve the cellulose fibers for obtaining a cellulose phosphoric acid solution. The cellulose solution was added into water as poor solvent to regenerate and reassemble RC with network structure (Fig. S 1) and enormous amorphous region (Fig. 2 (e)), and the final RC suspension was obtained after removal of phosphoric acid by repeated centrifugation. The acidochromic dye 1-hydroxy-4-[4-(ethylsulfurate sulfonyl)-phenylazo]-naphthalene (HESPN) was synthesized by diazo coupling reaction. The diazo component, originating from the reactants of NaNO2 and ESA/HCl solution at 4 °C, was added to the coupling component consisting of 1-naphthol and acetic acid, then they were stirred and reacted for 4 h at 20 °C. The HESPN dye was obtained after filtration, washing with acetic acid and drying. The mixture of RC suspension (2.5 wt%, 40 g), NaCl (4.80 g) and HESPN dye (100 mg) in a reactor was kept at 30 °C for 10 min before rising to 65 °C, then Na2CO3 (1.20 g) was added in the mixture at 65 °C and kept for 90 min. The product was obtained and named ARC after sequential washing with water-DMSO-water and homogenizing."
4,Preparation of PB/ARC hydrogels,"2.3 Preparation of PB/ARC hydrogels ARC suspension, PVA and water were added to a reactor and mechanically stirred at 90 °C for 2 h. Then the borax aqueous solution was added to above mixture and continued to stir for 10 min. Finally, the PB and PB/ARC hydrogels were obtained after cooling to room temperature. The compositions of resulting hydrogels were shown in Table 1 . PB/RC hydrogel was prepared by a method similar to PB/ARC-0.6 %, where RC was used instead of ARC."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations 2.4.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The cellulose suspensions (RC and ARC) and hydrogels (PB, PB/RC and PB/ARC-0.6 %) were frozen for 10 min using liquid nitrogen and subjected to freeze-drying on a DGJT-10 freeze-drier (China) at −55 °C for 24 h. The resulting dried samples were analyzed by a PerkingElmer Spectrum-Two (USA) spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. Specifically, the samples were either pre-cut into small slices of 3 mm length and 3 mm width (for PB, PB/RC and PB/ARC-0.6 %, which were in the form of a sponge) or directly loaded (for RC and ARC that were in the form of powders) in the sampler, compressed by a rotating pressure arm, and analyzed in the range of 500 - 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. 2.4.2 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) Solid state 13C NMR of RC and ARC were conducted on a spectrometer (Bruker AVANCE 400, Switzerland) in the proton noise-decoupling mode with 5 mm probe. 2.4.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD of samples were performed on X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max 2550PC, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 150 mA). The patterns were recorded from 2θ = 5° to 60°. 2.4.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Morphological analysis of the ARC and extracted ARC from PB/ARC hydrogel were carried out with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100, Japan) at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The extracted ARC was obtained by adding the PB/ARC hydrogel into HCl solution (pH = 5) to get the PB/ARC sol and then removing PVA and borax in PB/ARC sol through repeated washing-centrifuging-washing process. The concentration of ARC and extracted ARC suspensions was 0.1 mg/mL, and suspensions (30 μL) were deposited and dried on a carbon-coated copper grid for testing. 2.4.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Morphological structure of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels after freeze-drying and fracturing in liquid nitrogen was conducted on scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi TM-3030, Japan) operating at 15 kV accelerating voltage. The test samples were sprayed with a coating of gold by a sputtering apparatus (SBC-12, China) at 10 mA for 30 s. 2.4.6 UV–vis analysis UV–vis spectroscopy of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels with different pH values (2, 5, 10, 11 and 12) were studied by the UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA) in a range of 380−700 nm. The degree of substitution of dye in ARC was determined by a UV–vis spectrophotometer, and the solution for absorbance measurement was obtained by dissolving 0.1 g dried ARC powder using 70 wt% sulfuric acid (5 mL) and then diluting to appropriate volume. 2.4.7 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermal analysis of dried PB and PB/ARC (about 5 mg) were performed on the thermogravimetric analyzer (TG 209F1, Germany) under nitrogen atmosphere (20 mL/min gas flow) in a range of 30–600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. 2.4.8 Mechanical properties PB and PB/ARC-0.6 % hydrogels (5 mm diameter) were used to lift the weight with 200 g for evaluating the mechanical strength. Tensile property and compressive property of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels were investigated by a universal testing machine (UH6502, China). The hydrogels were cut into cuboid-shape specimens (60 mm × 5 mm × 3 mm) and used for tensile property at a strain rate of 100 mm/min. The hydrogels were prepared into cylindrical samples (30 mm diameter × 10 mm height) and used to be compressed to 80 % strain at a rate of 2 mm/min. 2.4.9 Rheological properties Rheological measurements of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels (35 mm diameter, 2 mm height) were performed on the rheometer (Thermo HAAKE-MARS 60, USA) equipped with a parallel-plate (35 mm in diameter). The frequency sweep experiments were carried out, and the viscosity, storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G’’) were recorded in a range of 0.01–10 Hz at 25 °C. Self-healing property of PB/ARC hydrogels was also characterized by the rheological tests. The curves of G’ and G’’ versus time for original PB/ARC hydrogel and self-healing PB/ARC hydrogel after being into 4 pieces were recorded within 600 s under 1% strain and 1 Hz. The curves of G’ and G’’ versus time for PB/ARC hydrogel were recorded with alternate change strain from 1% to 100 % under 1 Hz. The optical microscopy (Nikon, Eclipse 80i, Japan) is also used to observed the self-healing process of hydrogel after being cut into 2 pieces at room temperature. 2.4.10 pH responsive properties PB/ARC-0.6 % hydrogel was alternately treated with HCl (1 mol/L) and NaOH (1 mol/L) solution for 5 times to study the sol-gel transition of hydrogel. PB/ARC-0.6 % hydrogel was treated with HCl and NaOH solution with different pH values (2, 5, 10, 11 and 12) to study the effect of pH value on color change."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Fabrication of PB/ARC hydrogels,"3.1 Fabrication of PB/ARC hydrogels A simple method was used to fabricate the smart PB/ARC hydrogel, as shown in Fig. 1. The acidochromic ARC was first prepared by anchoring the dye on RC (Fig. 1(a)), and the color of cellulose suspension changed from milky to yellow after modification. As the ARC suspension changed from acidic to alkaline, its color also changed from yellow to purple due to the deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl group on the dye, and the process was reversible. Then the smart PB/ARC hydrogel was obtained by mixing the PVA, borax and ARC evenly (Fig. 1(b)). The resulting hydrogel showed brick-red due to its alkaline environment caused by borax hydrolysis, and the borate ions produced by hydrolysis reacted with the hydroxyl group of PVA to form a dynamically reversible complex network, which endowed hydrogel with self-healing property. In the PB/ARC hydrogel, ARC could form dynamic bonds with PVA or borax to improve the strength of hydrogel (as described below). The color-tunable ARC was investigated by FT-IR and solid-state 13C NMR. Compared with RC (Fig.2 (a)), the appearance of peak at 1545 cm−1 assigned to aromatic CC skeleton of dye demonstrated the existence of acidochromic dye in the ARC. The solid-state 13C NMR spectra of RC and ARC were recorded to illustrate grafting of HESPN dye on RC. In Fig. 2 (b–d), the amorphous region (60.95 ppm) of C6 in ARC showed maximum change in chemical shift and it was 0.65 ppm higher than that of RC, and the reason was the resonance up-shift effect of adjacent carbon during hydroxyl reaction (Ding et al., 2020; Gorgieva, Vogrinčič, & Kokol, 2015; Wang, Fu, Leu, & Dong, 2018). The degree of substitution of dye in ARC was calculated to be 0.0272 ± 0.0003 by UV–vis spectrophotometry. Fig. 2 (e) showed that the XRD of RC and ARC, in which the same diffraction peaks (2θ = 12.5° and 20.5°) corresponding to crystallographic form of cellulose Ⅱ were observed for both RC and ARC, while the crystallinity was slightly lowered from 36 % to 28 %, possibly due to the introduced dye broke the hydrogen bond between the cellulose chains. In Fig. 2(f), the TEM image showed that the resulting ARC consisted of fibrils with a length of several of micrometers and intertwined to form a networked structure, which facilitated physical entanglement and interaction between ARC and PVA chains for fabricating tough smart hydrogel. The FT-IR spectra of PVA, PB, PB/RC and PB/ARC are shown in Fig. 2 (g). The spectrum of PVA showed characteristic peaks at 3275 cm−1 (OH stretching vibration), 2913 cm−1 (CH2 stretching vibration), 1650 cm−1 (OH bending vibration of absorbed water), 1417 cm−1 (CH2 bending vibration), 1334 cm−1 (CH bending vibration), 1087 cm−1 (CO stretching vibration), 916 cm−1 (CH2 rocking vibration) and 843 cm−1 (CC stretching vibration). In addition, a small peak was observed at 1562 cm−1, which likely arose from carboxylate-containing impurities in commercial PVA. The PB spectrum looked similar to that of PVA, except the water peak at 1650 cm−1 grew more intense, possibly due to the hygroscopic nature of borax. Upon addition of RC and ARC into PB, a new peak at 1061 cm−1 characteristic of cellulose CO stretching was observed, while the spectrum of PB/ARC also showed increased intensity of absorption band at 1562 cm−1 resulting from vibration of the aromatic carbons on the chromophore. Fig. 2 (h) illustrated the UV–vis spectra of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels, the PB hydrogel was colorless and transparent, while the color of PB/ARC hydrogels gradually deepened and absorbance of hydrogels at 456 nm also increased with the increasing dosages of ARC. Therefore, the color of smart hydrogels could be tailored by simply adjusting the dosage of ARC. Similar to original ARC, TEM image in Fig. 2 (i) showed that extracted ARC from PB/ARC hydrogel was fibrous, suggesting that ARC dispersed in PB/ARC hydrogel in a fibrous form. The thermal stability of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels were evaluated and shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). It can be seen that PB and PB/ARC all degraded rapidly at about 280 and 433 °C, and the maximum decomposition temperature (284 °C) of PB/ARC-0.6 % was higher than PB (278 °C), which indicated that thermal stability of PB after adding ARC were improved slightly due to the physical interactions between PB matrix and ARC (Shao et al., 2017). The cross-section morphologies of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels were shown in Fig. 3 (c–f). The PB hydrogel showed a large and smooth porous structure, while the addition of ARC (0.2 %, 0.4 % and 0.6 %) to PB hydrogel resulted in the formation of unordered porous structure with smaller pore size, which might be beneficial for improving the mechanical properties of hydrogel due to the small pore distributed the stress evenly in the hydrogel to withstand strong stress (Bian, Jiao et al., 2018; Bian, Wei et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018)."
8,Mechanical properties of PB/ARC hydrogels,"3.2 Mechanical properties of PB/ARC hydrogels Mechanical properties are key parameters for hydrogels, and improving the mechanical properties is beneficial to meet the requirements in practical production and life. Here, the load bearing test of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels were conducted to evaluate their mechanical strength. As shown in Fig. 4 , it was found that when PB, PB/ARC-0.2 % and PB/ARC-0.4 % hydrogels were used to lift 200 g of weight, the hydrogels broke and the weight was not lifted. While, the PB/ARC-0.6 % hydrogels could lift up the weight with 200 g, which indicated the improved mechanical property of PB hydrogel by adding enough ARC. The reason may be that the introduction of ARC resulted in the entanglement between PVA and ARC and increasing cross-linking density of hydrogel network for transferring the stress to reinforce the PB hydrogel (Ge et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2017). The tensile test of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels was performed to further verify the improvement of ARC on mechanical property, and Fig. 5 (a) showed the tensile strength of hydrogels containing varied content of ARC. A significant increase of the maximum stress of PB/ARC hydrogels was from 5.2 to 35.3 kPa when the content of ARC increased from 0 to 0.6 % in the hydrogels, reflecting the obvious reinforcement role of ARC. In addition, the PB/ARC hydrogels also exhibited favorable compression property, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). For all the hydrogel samples, the compressive strength gradually increased with the increase of compressive strain and reached maximum value at 80 % strain. Compared with PB hydrogel (101.3 kPa), the compressive strength of PB/ARC hydrogels were higher and increased from 122.9 to 233.7 kPa with increasing ARC content from 0.2 % to 0.6 %, which revealed that the PB/ARC hydrogels became stronger. These phenomena were likely due to the increasing ARC dosage in hydrogel, which improved the small pore structure of hydrogel used to evenly distribute stress and the chemical and physical cross-linking network originated from complexation and hydrogen bond to prevent the crack propagation (Bian, Jiao et al., 2018; Bian, Wei et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2018). Rheology is also used to investigate the mechanical properties of PB and PB/ARC hydrogels. As shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d), the viscosity, storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G’’) of hydrogels increased significantly after the introduction of more ARC (0.6 %), reaching 761 Pa·s, 36,380 Pa and 6943 Pa, respectively. Fig. 5 (d) showed that the crossover (the point of transition between quasi-liquid state and quasi-solid state) of hydrogels gradually moved to low frequency with the increase of ARC content. These results also suggested improved mechanical property."
9,Self-healing properties of PB/ARC hydrogels,"3.3 Self-healing properties of PB/ARC hydrogels Self-healing ability is an important trait for hydrogel since it is beneficial to prolong the lifetime of materials. In this work, the smart hydrogels we made contained reversible didiol-borax complex and were expected to have self-healing ability, here the self-healing property of PB/ARC-0.6 % hydrogel as an example was illustrated in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the PB/ARC hydrogel was first cut in half, held in contact for 15 s without any external force and then stretched slightly, and the results showed that the two pieces of hydrogels were recombined quickly by the dynamic didiol-borax complexation and hydrogen bonds in hydrogels, showing rapid self-healing ability (Lu et al., 2016). The self-healing process of PB/ARC hydrogel was also observed by an optical microscope, as shown in Fig. 6 (b). The surface of hydrogel was scratched using a blade and left at room temperature, and the scratch was almost gone after 1 h without applied stress, which illustrated that the PB/ARC hydrogel owned a notable self-healing property. Fig. 6 (c) showed the self-healing mechanism of PB/ARC hydrogel. PB/ARC hydrogel had dynamic didiol-borax complexation and hydrogen bonds after introducing borax. When PVA/ARC hydrogel was cut into two pieces, these two dynamic bonds were cleaved at the interfaces. When the two cut pieces approached each other, the didiol-borax complexation and hydrogen bonds were restructured in the interfaces due to the strong linked tendency of borate ions and hydroxyl groups to heal into one piece of hydrogel. Rheological tests were conducted to quantitatively study the self-healing property of PB/ARC hydrogel. In Fig. 6 (d), the PB/ARC hydrogel was cut into four parts for testing the storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G’’) of self-healing hydrogel. It could be seen that the G’ (19,130 Pa) and G’’ (10,990 Pa) of self-healing PB/ARC hydrogel were closed to G’ (19,630 Pa) and G’’ (11,170 Pa) of original PB/ARC hydrogel, suggesting that most of network in hydrogel had been reconstructed by reversible didiol-borax complex and hydrogen bonds. In addition, continuous step strain measurements were carried out to investigate the self-healing recovery of hydrogel under strain damage, as shown in Fig. 6 (e). Under a low strain (γ = 1%), G’ of PB/ARC hydrogel was about 20,000 Pa and always higher than G’’ (11,210 Pa), showing a quasi-solid nature. Subsequently, G’ and G’’ of PB/ARC hydrogel significantly decreased due to the destruction of hydrogel network under a high strain (γ = 100 %), meanwhile the phenomenon of G’ (6000 Pa) lower than G’’ (7300 Pa) indicated that the hydrogel displayed a quasi-liquid state. When the PB/ARC hydrogel was treated with a low strain (γ = 1%) again, its G’ and G’’ quickly returned to the original state due to the reconfiguration of dynamic bond in hydrogel. These results revealed that PB/ARC hydrogel exhibited excellent thixotropic and auto-recovery properties."
10,pH responsive properties of PB/ARC hydrogels,"3.4 pH responsive properties of PB/ARC hydrogels Regenerated cellulose reinforced self-healing PB/ARC hydrogel also had excellent pH responsive properties, as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 (a) displayed a reversible sol-gel conversion under acidic and alkaline conditions. The hydrogel started in a purple gel state, and it completely turned into a yellow sol state within 10 min after adding HCl aqueous solution. The obtained yellow sol became the purple gel state again within 10 min after the addition of NaOH aqueous solution. This process was repeated for 5 cycles to illustrate the excellent sol-gel conversion ability of hydrogel in the acid-alkaline environment. The sol-gel conversion behaviors of PB/ARC hydrogel might be attributed to the destruction and reconstruction of the didiol-borax complex in response to pH value change (Lu et al., 2016). Fig. 7 (b) showed the color change of hydrogel at different pH values. As the pH value increased from 5 to 12, the hydrogel appeared yellow, brick-red and purple in turn due to the deprotonation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of the dye on ARC, and the color transition was reversible and rapid in several seconds. The color change with pH value of PB/ARC hydrogel was also monitored by UV–vis spectra, as shown in Fig. 7 (c) and (d). The maximum absorption wavelength (λm) varied from 456 nm (yellow) to 547 nm (purple) when the pH value changed between 5 and 12. Fig. 7 (d) exhibited the fatigue resistance of PB/ARC hydrogel in strong acid solution (pH = 2) and strong alkaline solution (pH = 12), and the results suggested that the λm of the hydrogel under strong acidic and alkaline condition remained basically unchanged at about 456 nm (pH = 2) and 547 nm (pH = 12) after 10 cycle tests. Therefore, the smart hydrogel showed great application prospects due to its pH response performance."
11,Conclusion,"In this work, a multifunctional smart hydrogel with improved mechanical strength was constructed by incorporating ARC into PVA/borax hydrogel. After introducing ARC, the color, thermal stability and pore structure of PB/ARC hydrogel became more darker, higher and smaller with the increase of ARC content, respectively. Compared with PB hydrogel, it was found that PB/ARC hydrogel could lift up 200 g of weight. Moreover, the tensile strength and compressive strength of PB/ARC hydrogel increased from 5.2 kPa and 101.3 kPa to 35.3 kPa and 233.7 kPa with the increased ARC content from 0 to 0.6 %, respectively. The increase of viscosity, storage modulus and loss modulus of hydrogel further verified improved mechanical strength after the introduction of ARC. PB/ARC hydrogel was automatically fused within 15 s and could quickly restore to the original state after undergoing different shear strain, which demonstrated excellent self-healing property. For smart PB/ARC hydrogel, the change of color from yellow to purple and the sol-gel state could be adjusted by controlling the pH values. Therefore, this work described a facile method to fabricate tough smart hydrogel."
