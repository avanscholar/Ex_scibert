0,Introduction,"As global energy consumption drastically increased during the last half-century, the development of economical and environmentally-friendly renewable energy has been a major challenge. There is no single solution to all energy-related problems, but in recent years, biodiesel has become an alternative energy source for mitigating the energy shortage. A transesterification process, the most common process for biodiesel production, produces about 10wt% of glycerol as a by-product. Hence, as the production of biodiesel increases, it becomes very important to find a means to utilize such excess glycerol. One alternative that seems promising is the use of glycerol as a renewable source for producing hydrogen. Steam reforming (SR) is a commercially efficient process for producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, hydrocarbons, alcohols, biomass, etc. The catalytic steam reforming of glycerol has been attracting a great deal of interest, as one mole of glycerol contains four moles of H2, which is higher amount than that of methanol and ethanol, although the H2:C mole ratio of glycerol is lower than that of methanol and ethanol. The steam reforming of glycerol involves the rupturing of CC, OH, and CH bonds, except for the CO ones [1–3] whilst the type of catalyst that is used strongly influences the product yield and selectivity. Much of the research on the catalyst has emphasized noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, and Ru [4–12], and non-noble metals, such as Ni [1,13–19], which are supported over several metal oxides, such as Al2O3, TiO2, CeO2, ZrO2, SiO2, and MgO. Among these catalysts, Ni-based catalysts on Al2O3 supports have received the most attention due to the catalysts’ low cost, availability and ability to break CC, CH, and OH bonds [1,13–15,20]. This type of catalyst also promotes a combined water-gas shift reaction that helps to remove the adsorbed CO from the catalyst’s surface [1,15,20]. However, it has been reported that most Ni catalysts suffer severely from coking and metal sintering, which result in the reduction of the catalyst’s activity and stability. These deactivations could be lowered by the addition of a promoter, largely in the form of metal oxides, especially lanthanide oxides, onto the Al2O3 supports. CeO2, a lanthanide oxide known as an oxygen storage material, has been the most frequently employed as the promoter for Ni/Al2O3 in several reactions particularly the steam reforming of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds [12,15,21–23]. This use of CeO2 has been a result of its remarkable structural and chemical properties, which enhance the dispersion of the active metals, to improve the stability of the Al2O3 support, and to alter the interaction between the metal and the support. In recent studies of glycerol steam reforming, ceria added onto the Al2O3 support of Ni catalysts improved both of the catalytic activity in terms of the glycerol conversion, and the physicochemical properties of the catalyst by stabilizing the Ni phase, and inhibiting the formation of coke and NiAl2O4 [1,10,12,13,15]. Adhikari et al. [10]. performed the glycerol SR over several noble metals (Ni, Pt, Rh Pd, Ir, Ru) on Al2O3 and CeO2/Al2O3 supports to find that CeO2 greatly improved the activity of Rh/Al2O3. As a catalytic promoter, ceria improves the stability of the active Ni phase [1] and retards the formation of inactive NiAl2O4 species [12]. Buffoni et al. [13] reported that Ni/α-Al2O3 modified by CeO2 inhibits the secondary dehydration reactions that generate unsaturated hydrocarbons and coke precursors, thereby causing the deactivation of the catalyst. According to Iriondo et al. [15], CeO2 promoter loading has a significant influence on the behavior of Ni/Al2O3 in glycerol SR. Only low CeO2 loading (5–10%) improves the activity of the catalyst. The enhancement of the activity of Ni/Al2O3 by CeO2 in the steam reforming of a glycerol-ethanol mixture was confirmed. Also, the performance of Ni/Al2O3 was better than that of Pt/Al2O3 [24]. In all previous studies of GSR over Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, all promoted CeO2-Al2O3 supports had been prepared by impregnating a ceria precursor on a commercial γ-Al2O3 support. No previous GSR work has used Ni-based catalysts supported on CeO2-Al2O3 derived by a sol-gel method, even though the method supports well-developed mesoporous structures of uniform pore sizes, high homogeneity for several components during synthesis, a high surface area, and high catalytic activity [25–30]. Moreover, an inclusive comparison between preparation methods has not yet been done on the structural characteristics of CeO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides and the catalytic behavior in GSR over nickel catalysts on CeO2-Al2O3 supports. This study investigated the effects of preparing CeO2-Al2O3 by a single-step sol-gel and impregnation method on the physico-chemical and structural properties of the mixed oxides and the Ni-supported catalysts. The catalytic activity, gas product selectivity, and coke resistance of the Ni catalysts supported on the oxides, towards the steam reforming of glycerol were studied. The CeO2-Al2O3 supports and Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were comprehensively characterized by several techniques."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The two alumina supports used to prepare the catalysts were commercial Al2O3 (Japan Chemicals) and a sol-gel derived alumina or xerogel, denoted as “Al_C” and “Al_S”, respectively. The Al2O3 xerogel was prepared by first dissolving an alumina precursor, aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (Al(OCH[CH3]C2H5)3 or ASB (97% purity, Aldrich) in ethanol (99.9% purity, QRëC) with vigorous stirring and heated up to 80°C. Next, nitric acid (67% solution, QRëC) was gently added into the mixed solution for partially hydrolyzing the aluminum precursor, and a clear sol was subsequently obtained. After the sol was cooled down to room temperature, deionized water was added, and transparent gel formed within a few minutes. Then, the gel was aged, dried at 120°C for 3h and calcined at 800°C for 3h to yield the Al2O3 xerogel. It was denoted as “Al_S” and used as a support for loading ceria promoter in the next step. Three CeO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides at 10wt% CeO2 were prepared by two methods, impregnation and sol-gel. For impregnation method, both Al_C and Al_S were the supports impregnated with cerium nitrate precursor (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, 99% purity (Aldrich Chemistry)). As described in the literature [31,32], the slurry of alumina powder and cerium nitrate solution was stirred vigorously overnight. After that, the impregnated slurry was dried and calcined at the same condition as shown above (120°C for 3h and 800°C for 3h, respectively). The promoted supports prepared from “Al_C” and “Al_S” were denoted as “CeAl_IC” and “CeAl_IS”, respectively. The third CeO2-Al2O3 support was prepared via the single-step sol-gel method which was done by making two separate solutions of the ASB and the cerium nitrate in ethanol. Then, they were vigorously mixed and stirred. As with the hydrolysis of the cerium-alumina precursors, gelation, drying and calcination procedures were followed using the same condition as above. The calcined CeO2-Al2O3 powder obtained via this single-step sol-gel method was designated as “CeAl_SS”. The Ni catalysts supported on all the CeO2-Al2O3 supports were prepared via the impregnation method following the procedure and condition described in our previous work [31,32]. The Ni at 15wt% was added into the CeO2-Al2O3 supports by using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, (97% purity, QRëC) as the metal precursor. The paste of the Ni-based catalyst powder obtained were then dried and calcined at the same condition as that of the supports. The Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts prepared using CeAl_IC, CeAl_IS and CeAl_SS supports were labeled as “NiCeAl_IC”, “NiCeAl_IS” and “NiCeAl_SS”, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 N2 adsorption-desorption The surface area of the catalysts was measured with an Autosorb I analyzer (Quantachrome) by applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method of N2 physisorprtion at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen (77K), while the pore size distributions of all the catalysts were determined by the Barret-Joyner-Hallender (BJH) method, as applied to the desorption branch of the nitrogen isotherm. Prior to the measurements, all the supports and the catalysts were sieved, and those with sizes of less than 250μm were evacuated at 120°C for 3h to ensure that there was no adsorbed moisture on the surface of the catalysts, which were then reduced by flowing H2 gas (99.99%, Praxair Thailand) at 700°C for 3h. Following the reduction, the catalysts were subsequently flushed under He (99.99%, Praxair Thailand) until cooling down to room temperature and were collected in the container kept in the desiccator cabinet in order to avoid exposing the reduced catalysts to air. 2.2.2 H2 chemisorption The amount of active Ni sites and the Ni dispersion on the catalyst surface were calculated from the H2-chemisorption data obtained using pulse chemisorption technique on a Micrometric Chemisorb 2720. Prior to the analysis, 0.1g of the catalyst was reduced in H2 flow at 700°C for 3h, and subsequently cooled in H2 stream down to 400°C and flushed with N2, each for 1h. After that, the temperature was decreased to 100°C for chemisorption analysis. The amount of H2 consumed was determined by periodically injecting 0.1μL of 99.99% H2 onto the sample and repeating at an interval of 10min until the successive consumption peaks exhibited the same area. A chemisorption stoichiometry H:Ni of 1:1 and a cross-sectional area of Ni of 6.494×10−20 m2 Ni-atom−1 were assumed in the calculation. 2.2.3 X-ray diffraction The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of all the promoted supports and catalysts were obtained by using a Phillips PW 1830 equipped with CuKα source radiation (λ=0.1538nm). The powder sample was sieved for particles with sizes less than 250μm and it was dried at 120°C for 3h to remove the moisture before analysis. The fresh catalysts were reduced under H2 gas flow at 700°C for 3h and were kept in the desiccator cabinet. Bragg angles between 10° to 100° were scanned at a rate of 0.05° (2θ)s−1. The mean crystallite diameters of Ni and CeO2 were calculated, using Scherrer’s equation, from the XRD peaks at 2θ of 51.8° (200) and 28.6° (111) for Ni and CeO2, respectively. 2.2.4 H2 temperature-programmed reduction Hydrogen-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed to investigate the interaction between nickel species and supports, and the reducibility of the catalysts. The characterization was conducted by using a Quantachrome apparatus (ChemBET 3000). In each measurement, 0.1g of a sample was reduced in a stream of a 10% H2/N2 mixture. The temperature of the sample was then increased from 50°C to 900°C at a ramping rate of 10°Cmin−1. The H2 consumption as a function of temperature was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) cell. 2.2.5 NH3-Temperature programmed desorption Surface acidity of the samples was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) on a Chemisorb 2720 chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics). The Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 samples were ex situ reduced at 700°C for 3h under H2 atmosphere. It was then placed into a quartz reactor and was pretreated in He flow at 200°C for 30min prior to NH3 adsorption. Upon cooling to room temperature, the sample was then saturated by an NH3 stream containing 15 vol% NH3 in He (Linde Thailand) at 110°C for 1h. Then the weakly adsorbed NH3 was subsequently removed by flushing with He (99.99% purity) until the baseline was stabilized. The NH3-TPD analysis was carried out with a temperature ramp of 10°Cmin−1 from 30 to 700°C in a He flow at 20mLmin−1. The desorption profile was monitored by a TCD cell and normalized by mass of the sample. 2.2.6 X-ray absorption near edge structure X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurement was recorded in the transmission mode at the Ni K edge and the Ce LIII edge at the Beamline 8 of the Synchrotron Light Research Institute, Thailand. The Ge (220) crystal was used as a fixed-cut double crystal monochromator (DCM) for selecting the high X-ray energy range from the synchrotron radiation (1.2GeV). The mixture of helium and argon gas was pumped into the ion chambers installed in front of and behind the sample in which the incident (I0) and the transmitted (I1). X-ray beams were continuously detected. Each sample was spread on the sample frame and sealed with Kapton windows. 2.2.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The surface chemical composition and oxidation state of the samples were characterized by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. Photoelectron spectra were performed using an AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical) electron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα monochromatic X-ray radiation source (hν =1486.69eV) at a power of 150W. A hemisphere photoelectron analyzer operated at constant pass energies of 80eV and 20eV for the survey and the high resolution scans, respectively. The catalysts were reduced ex-situ at 700°C under flowing H2 gas for 3h and were preserved in a desiccator cabinet. The sample was outgassed before transferring the XPS sample holder to the ion-pumped analysis chamber for data acquisition under 3×10−10 mbar. The peak of C 1s located at the peak binding energy of 284.6eV was used as an internal reference to correct all spectra. 2.2.8 Thermogravimetric analysis The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the change in weight due to coke deposited on the catalyst in relation to the change in temperature. The TGA analysis of the spent catalysts was performed by using a Pyris 1 TGA (PerkinElmer). Approximately 10mg of each sample was evacuated to remove the moisture before being placed in a holder. The sample weight was recorded under heating from a room temperature to 110°C, and maintained for 10min before heating it to 900°C in flowing O2 at 60mLmin−1 with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. The amount of coke deposited was calculated and presented in a unit of mmolCgCat−1 h−1."
4,Catalytic reforming of glycerol,"2.3 Catalytic reforming of glycerol The catalytic activity of the Ni-based catalysts in glycerol steam reforming was performed in a fixed bed reactor, operated isothermally at 700°C with a steam-to-glycerol molar ratio of 9, and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 42,000h−1. Prior to the reforming reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 700°C by flowing H2 gas of 40mLmin−1 for 3h. The glycerol solution (prepared from 99.5% glycerol (QRëC)) was then introduced into the pre-heater controlled at 300°C by using a HPLC pump (Eldex) with a flow rate of 0.1mLmin−1 before the solution entered the reactor. High purity (99.99%) He was used as the carrier gas. The outlet gas stream from the reactor was immediately cooled to condense and separate the liquid product. The gas product was collected and subsequently analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). H2, CO, and CH4 were detected by using a Molecular Sieve 13X column, whereas a Porapak Q column was used for determining CO2, CH4 and C2 hydrocarbons in the gas product. The condensed liquid products were qualitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS). A gas chromatograph (Clarus®680, Perkin Elmer) provides with a 30m×0.25mm Elite-WAX ETR capillary column and is directly connected with a mass spectrometer (Clarus®SQ8T) detector. He (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 2mLmin−1. The temperature was kept constant at 40°C for 5min, then it was increased to 250°C at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. The m/z was fully scanned from 29 to 120 under electron impact ionization at 70eV. The temperatures of both the injector and the FID detector were kept constant at 250°C. 1μL of sample was injected with a split ratio of 100:1. The activity of each catalyst was generally reported in terms of the conversions of the glycerol into gas phase (XGly), the product yield (Yi), and the product selectivity (Si), as formulated in the following equations: (1) X Gly ( % ) = moles of total C atoms in gas product moles of C atoms in feed × 100 For the H2 gas product: (2) Y H 2 ( % ) = moles of H 2 in gas product 7 × moles of glycerol in feed × 100 (3) S H 2 ( % ) = moles of H 2 in gas product moles of C atoms in gas product × 1 RR × 100 where RR is the reforming ratio of H2 to CO2 and is equal to 7/3 based on the stoichiometry of the glycerol steam reforming, as presented in Eq. (4): (4) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 3CO 2 For CO, CO2 and hydrocarbons (i): (5) Y i ( % ) = moles of species i in gas product moles of C atoms in feed × 100 (6) S i ( % ) = moles of species i in gas product moles of C atoms in gas product × 100"

6,Characterization of the supports and catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the supports and catalysts 3.1.1 Physical properties The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the Al2O3 and CeO2-Al2O3 supports, and the Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The CeO2-Al2O3 supports and the catalysts supported on CeO2-Al2O3 exhibited the same type IV isotherm, the characteristic of mesoporous solids, as that of the pure Al2O3 supports but with different hysteresis loops of pore structure. The supports and the Ni supported on the commercial alumina (Al_C, CeAl_IC and NiCeAl_IC) had H3-type hysteresis loop showing the “slit-shaped” pore structure. On the other hand, those based on sol-gel alumina (Al_S, CeAl_SS, CeAl_IS, NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_SS) yielded H2-type hysteresis loops indicating the existence of the “ink-bottle” pore structure, narrow pore mouth and large cavity. The detailed physical properties of Al2O3, CeO2-Al2O3 and Ni catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The Al_S shows smaller pore volume and average pore size diameter with narrower pore size distribution than does the Al_C (4–15nm vs. 4–30nm). It can be explained by the nature of the pore formation of the Al2O3 supports prepared from different methods. The pores of the Al_C support was formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles [27,33] while the Al_S pores were composed of initiating links between the sol particles forming a three-dimensional solid network [34]. Hence, the pore size distributions of the promoted supports follow those of the pure alumina supports; CeAl_SS and CeAl_IS oxides in the range of 3–15nm and 2–17nm, respectively, 4–30nm for CeAl_IC. These results reflect the more well-developed mesoporous structure of the sol-gel-based oxides over the conventional-based oxide. After impregnating CeO2 promoter into both Al_C and Al_S supports, the BET surface areas of the CeAl_IC and CeAl_IS promoted supports were severely reduced (from 220 to 167m2 g−1 and 241 to 137m2 g−1, respectively) as the small and some large pores had been blocked and partially filled with the CeO2 promoter. On the other hand, incorporating cerium onto the alumina structure of CeAl_SS prepared by sol-gel method caused a significant decrease in surface area of the promoted xerogel support (from 241 to 200m2 g−1). Impregnation of Ni component over the CeO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides further decreased the surface area of all the catalysts because of the coverage over the internal support surface and the pore blockage by nickel species. Among these catalysts the NiCeAl_SS had the highest value of 141m2 g−1 followed by NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC (131 and 129m2 g−1), respectively. 3.1.2 Crystalline structures of supports and Ni-based catalysts The crystalline phases of all the calcined oxides examined by XRD are illustrated in Fig. 2 (a). The reflections at 2-theta of 37.7°, 39.4°, 45.8°, and 66.8° were identified as the γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS 79-1558), and those at 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3°, 59.1°, 69.4°, 76.7°, 79.1°, 88.4°, and 95.4°, which belong to the cubic phase of CeO2 (JCPDS 34-0394), were detected in all the promoted supports. The calculated CeO2 crystal size (6.5nm) of the CeAl_SS is considerably smaller than those of CeAl_IS (9.0nm) and CeAl_IC (8.6nm), as summarized in Table 2 . It is also interesting to note that both CeAl_IS and CeAl_IC exhibited much higher intensity in the CeO2 crystalline than did the one prepared by the single step sol-gel method, although all the mixed oxides had the same ceria loading. This is an indication of the formation of a well-dispersed CeAlO3 species on the CeAl_SS. Fig. 2(b) presents the XRD patterns of all the reduced Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts and shows the peaks at 2-theta of 44.5°, 51.8°, 76.3°, and 92.9° corresponding to the Ni phase (JCPDS 04-0850). Also they all have the reflections at 19.1°, 31.4°, 37.0°, 45.0°, 65.5°, and 77.7° corresponding to the NiAl2O4 phase (JCPDS 10-0339). The presence of the NiAl2O4 phase arises from the incorporation of the NiO phase into the γ-Al2O3 phase and can be substantiated from two indications: (i) the relative intensity of the main reflection peaks (37° and 45°) commonly appear in both γ-Al2O3 and NiAl2O4 according to JCPDS 79-1558 (γ-Al2O3) and JCPDS 10-0339 (NiAl2O4) [35], and (ii) the shift of the maximum reflection peak of Al2O3 (440) from 2-theta of 66.8° to the lower angle of 66.3° for both NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC, and 66.5° for NiCeAl_SS, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (a). A further explanation for the former indication could be given regarding the relative intensities of the peaks at 37° to 45° for the γ-Al2O3 and the NiAl2O4, which are 0.69 and 1.54, respectively. The ratios for NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC were found to be 0.96 and 0.83 which are in-between those of γ-Al2O3 and NiAl2O4. However, for the NiCeAl_SS catalyst, the ratio was at 0.37, which is much lower than those of both phases. Further consideration was given to the peaks corresponding to the Ni phase especially at the 2-theta range of 43°−46°, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The NiCeAl_SS catalyst obviously shows the Ni phase at 44.5° whereas a broad peak starting from 43.2° to 46.7° was observed for NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC, indicating the existence of the NiAl2O4 phase in both catalysts. From crystal size estimation using Scherrer’s equation, the Ni crystallite sizes of the NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts are larger than that of the NiCeAl_IC catalyst, as listed in Table 2. The peaks corresponding to CeO2 structure were also observed in all the catalysts and the reduced NiCeAl_SS had the least relative intensity of the CeO2, which is similar to what was observed for the promoted support. In addition, the CeO2 crystal sizes for all the reduced catalysts were found nearly unchanged, showing that the impregnation of the nickel precursor onto the CeO2-Al2O3 supports had had an insignificant influence on the crystallite size of the CeO2. It is possible that there was no or little interaction between nickel and ceria as Ni2+ is not favored to integrate in the ceria structure, because of the too small ionic radius in VIII coordination [36], whilst the nickel species was well dispersed on the supports. 3.1.3 Metal dispersion The number of active sties and Ni dispersion results of all the reduced catalysts determined by H2-pulse chemisorption measurement are given in Table 1. It is shown that NiCeAl_SS has the highest number of active sites and metal dispersion which are slightly higher than those of NiCeAl_IS, and almost twice of NiCeAl_IC. This is because of the higher amount of the easily reducible nickel species on the NiCeAl_SS than that on the NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts as shown in the XRD results, and the higher surface area of the sol-gel based oxides. It is anticipated that ceria incorporated into alumina structure during the sol-gel preparation thereby lowering the interaction between nickel and alumina. This result is in agreement with that of the XRD. 3.1.4 Reducibility of the CeO2-Al2O3 and the Ni-based catalysts The H2-TPR of the promoted supports and the Ni catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively. Five temperature regions, located at below 300°C, 300–480°C, 480–620°C, 620–790°C and above 790°C, were observed in the TPR profiles of all the CeO2-Al2O3 supports, which are in accordance with the literature [12,25,37,38]. The broad peak observed below 300°C, which is much in evidence for the CeAl_SS support, corresponded to the removal of the moisture physisorbed on the support [39] and the oxygen adsorption on the Al2O3 [37,40]. The regions in the medium temperature ranges of 300–480°C and 480–620°C are related to the elimination of the surface oxygen atoms on the small CeO2 crystallites [25,38,41] and the formation of the non-stoichiometric CeOx phase, respectively [38,39,42]. Subsequently, the surface of the residual ceria that had been in more contact with the Al2O3 surface was reduced to form superficial CeAlO3 with the replacement of the Ce3+ cations in the Ce2O3 species that had been formed into the first layer of the Al2O3 during the prolonged reduction, which corresponded to the peak in the range of 620–790°C [37,38]. The last region, which is above 790°C, represents the removal of the oxygen atoms located in large bulk CeO2 crystallites [25,37,38,41]. For CeAl_IC support, the reduction peaks were observed in wide temperature regions with the maximum peaks centered at 394°C, 590°C, 739°C, and 880°C as shown in Fig. 4(a). The CeAl_SS support had small and broad reduction peaks ranging from 350°C to 880°C with the maximum peaks centered at 444°C, 603°C, 788°C, and 856°C. The very low intensity of the peaks for the CeAl_SS support could be attributed to the reduction of the much smaller sizes of CeO2 and the formation of well-dispersed CeAlO3, which is consistent with the XRD results. Contrary to what was observed for the CeAl_IC and CeAl_SS supports, the TPR profile for the CeAl_IS clearly shows the reduction peak in the medium to high-temperature regions with a maximum at 867°C, accompanied by a broad shoulder at 474°C, 619°C, and 765°C. Moreover, the latter peaks in the high-temperature region that are the characteristics of the bulk ceria reduction for the CeAl_IS and CeAl_IC supports prevailed considerably over that of the CeAl_SS support. These results suggest that the CeAl_IS and CeAl_IC supports had more portions of large CeO2 crystallite size than did the CeAl_SS support [25], which is consistent with the XRD results presented in Table 2. In other words, the reducibility of the supports increases with decreasing crystallite size of CeO2. The similar finding has been reported for TiO2 used as a support for Pt catalyst in water-gas-shift reaction [43]. The TPR profiles of the NiCeAl_SS, NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts exhibit similar broad reduction bands with maximum temperatures of 820°C, 810°C and 835°C, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). By performing curve-fitting and Gaussian multiple peaks deconvolution using Origin software, the three peak components of the reducible species and their corresponding area percentages were obtained as shown in Fig. 4(b) and summarized in Table 3 , respectively. The first peak appearing at a temperature below 650°C is the reduction peak of NiO interacting with Al2O3 support [15,35,44]. The second and the third reduction peaks, with the maximum peaks at 760–800°C and above 820°C, are ascribed to the reduction of the non-stoichiometric nickel aluminate species (NiAlxOy) and the stoichiometric species of NiAl2O4, respectively [12,33]. The Gaussian deconvolutions for the reducible species of the CeO2-Al2O3 supports were ignored because of the inconsiderable amount of CeO2-Al2O3 reduction when compared to the amounts of Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 reduction. The NiCeAl_SS catalyst shows three reduction peaks with maximum temperatures at 614°C, 774°C and 826°C, whereas the maximum peaks at 572°C, 757°C, and 812°C were observed for the NiCeAl_IS catalyst. Although the peaks of NiCeAl_IS had shifted to lower temperatures, the proportion of the reducible NiO-Al2O3 species of the NiCeAl_SS catalyst was larger than that of the NiCeAl_IS catalyst. By comparing with the NiCeAl_IC catalyst exhibiting the reduction peaks at the highest temperatures of 685°C, 802°C, and 844°C, the NiO-Al2O3 species of the NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts are in smaller quantities but more easily reduced at lower temperatures than that of the NiCeAl_IC catalyst. In addition, the stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric nickel aluminate species (NiAl2O4 and NiAlxOy) of both NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS were present at much lower temperatures than those of NiCeAl_IC. This shows that the nickel species on the xerogel alumina support had retained higher reducibility than did the one on the commercial non-xerogel alumina. The higher reducibility was a result of the incorporation of ceria into the alumina prepared by the sol-gel method. These results are also in agreement with those of XRD. 3.1.5 Acidity of Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts The NH3-TPD was performed to obtain the concentrations of the acid sites as well as acidity of the catalysts. The TPD profiles are displayed in Fig. 5 . The area under the peak was calibrated with a known quantity of NH3. Then, the amount of NH3 adsorbed representing the surface acid site concentration of the catalysts can be calculated as summarized in Table 3. Three catalysts have similar ammonia desorption patterns with a broad shape in the temperature range of 30–700°C, but with different acid site concentrations. NiCeAl_SS shows the highest total amount of acid sites than do NiCeAl_IC and NiCeAl_IS. Furthermore, the catalysts supported on the sol-gel derived xerogel showed a high temperature peak at about 350°C. These acid sites were contributed by the occurrence of CeAlO3 species [45] whilst the typical impregnation method induces the formation of fewer CeAlO3 perovskite structures. Guo et al. [30] also reported that the presence of higher temperature peaks on the CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by the sol-gel method had resulted from the interaction between the Ce species and Al2O3. The high temperature acid sites correspond to the Brønsted acid sites of the solid surface [30] and the strong Lewis acid sites contributed by Al2O3 [45,48], whereas the low temperature acid sites are weak acid sites and mainly contributed by CeO2 [46] due to its generally weak basicity [47]. 3.1.6 X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) To investigate the change in the Ni and Ce oxidation states after reduction with flowing pure H2 at 700°C for 3h, the electronic characters of the Ni and Ce atoms were explored by the XANES method. The XANES signals from the measured absorption spectra were extracted by the pre-edge background and were normalized by dividing the peak intensity by the height of the absorption edge. The data reduction was analyzed using the Athena software program. 3.1.6.1 Oxidation state of Ni Fig. 6 depicts the XANES spectra of the Ni K-absorption edge for the Ni standard, Ni foil (Ni0) and NiO (Ni2+), and the Ni samples, NiCeAl_SS, NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts. The XANES spectra of the NiO standard exhibited a small pre-edge peak due to the 1s-3d transition [12,49], and the white line of that sample was observed at 8350.2eV. In contrast, the weak pre-edge peak at 8332.7eV, or no white line, appertained to the Ni0 standard. After the catalyst samples were reduced, a change in the adsorption edge energy and a decrease in the white line intensity were observed for all the reduced catalysts. This indicated that Ni2+ in all the catalysts had been converted to Ni0 [12]. Additionally, the NiCeAl_SS had the highest reducibility, as its XAS profile was the closest to the Ni0 standard. This was in agreement with the results of the TPR studies. 3.1.6.2 Oxidation state of Ce The XANES spectra of the Ce LIII edge of the Ce standard, CeO2 (Ce4+) and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Ce3+), the fresh and the reduced Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The difference of XANES spectra between Ce4+ and Ce3+ is evidently presented as illustrated in Fig. 7(a) and (h), respectively. The Ce LIII edge XANES spectrum of CeO2 exhibits two main detached peaks at 5729.4 and 5736.2eV, labeled as B2 and C, respectively. The appearance of these two peaks corresponds to the different final states of Ce caused by the hybridization of the 4f orbital of Ce and the 2p orbital of O. The first white line, B2, occurs due to the electron transfer from the 2p orbital of O to the Ce 4f orbital, Ce [2p54f15d*,1] O 2p5, while the second peak, C, was found because there was no electron contained in the 4f orbital of Ce and no holes in the 2p orbital of O, Ce [2p54f05d*,1] O 2p6. This is in good agreement with the results reported in the literatures [50–52]. Besides the two main peaks, a small pre-edge peak at 5717.6eV, labeled as A, was also observed on CeO2 (Ce4+), because of the transition of the unoccupied Ce d-state at the bottom of the conduction band or the dipole-forbidden 2p3/2 to 4f [51,53]. Although the energy shift of the pre-edge peak is often used to determine the oxidation states of the Ce species in samples, it was hardly observed here as it was too subtle. Moreover, the shoulder of the intense B2 peak at 5726.7eV ascribed to the final state transition of Ce [2p54f15d*,1] O 2p5 was labeled as B1. This shoulder peak was observed on Ce4+ compounds and other rare earth oxides with a fluorite structure [50]. In contrast to the XANES spectrum for CeO2, the simple shape of Ce3+ absorption state was found, as only single white line at 5724.8eV, noted as B0, was observed, corresponding to the Ce [2p54f15d*,1] O 2p6 final state [50,52–54]. The single strong absorption not only was observed on the Ce(NO3)3·6H2O but also on all the Ce3+ compound, as investigated in the literatures [52,53]. The XANES spectra of the Ce LIII absorption edge for all the fresh Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were very similar to those of the CeO2 spectra as shown in Fig. 7 ((b)-(d)). Moreover, the trivial change in the height of the edge jump at the white line observed in the fresh catalysts could have resulted from the differences in the particle sizes and morphologies of the catalysts [51]. After all the fresh catalysts had been reduced under H2 atmosphere at 700°C, the peaks, identified as B2 and C, decreased, and a new white line noted as B0 was observed (See Fig. 7 (e)-(g)). Nevertheless, the presence of CeO2 was also detected, as the respective line labeled as C still appeared [54]. By comparison, the reduced NiCeAl_SS spectra contained the peak C, which was less intense than those of the reduced NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts. These results indicated that the NiCeAl_SS catalyst was more easily reducible than NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts. 3.1.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 3.1.7.1 Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 samples As with the XAS analysis, the XPS technique was extended to all the reduced catalysts for determining the oxidation state of the Ni element and the surface composition of the Ni species in different chemical states. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of the Ni species for the reduced catalysts were fitted by Gaussian-Lorentzian curve-fitting done with the CasaXPS software program in order to determine the peak areas for obtaining the relative surface proportion of the Ni species after subtracting a Shirley background. The XPS spectra of the Ni 2p3/2 core-levels for the reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 , and the binding energies of each Ni species are summarized in Table 4 . The XPS spectra for Ni 2p3/2 core-levels in all the reduced catalysts were deconvoluted into three peaks located at ∼851.6, 853.0, and 855.3eV, indicating the different oxidation states of Ni that corresponded to Ni0, Ni2+ from NiO weakly interacting with the Al2O3 support, and Ni2+ from the NiAlxOy and NiAl2O4 spinel structures, respectively [15,44,55]. Moreover, shake-up satellite peaks were observed at the binding energies of 857.4 and 861.5eV, showing the existence of Ni0 and Ni2+ species, respectively [55]. It indicates that there was a mixture of metallic Ni and Ni2+ species on the surfaces of all the reduced catalysts, inferring that some of the surface Ni2+ species had hardly been reduced into metallic Ni. This result is in agreement with the H2-TPR study. The relative proportions of different Ni species in the reduced catalysts were determined as listed in Table 4. After reduction, the divalent Ni strongly interacted with the Al2O3 support and formed NiAl2O4 which is the predominant species on the surfaces of all the reduced catalysts, especially the NiCeAl_IC catalyst. NiO which is the other Ni2+ form and easily reducible species was present the least in NiCeAl_IC, in the amount of less than half of those in NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_SS. Additionally, twice the amount of Ni0 was observed over the superficial NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts, as compared to that of the NiCeAl_IC catalyst. It is inferred that the NiCeAl_SS and the NiCeAl_IS catalysts had retained higher reducibility than the NiCeAl_IC. These results are in agreement with the XRD, TPR, and XAS results. 3.1.7.2 CeO2-Al2O3 samples Analysis of the XPS spectra of the Ce 3d core levels for all the Ni-based catalysts cannot distinguish the Ce 3d region from the Ni 2p region, because of the partial overlapping between Ni 2p1/2 and Ce 3d5/2 peaks located in binding energy rage of ∼870–890eV. To elucidate the effects of the alumina texture and the CeO2-Al2O3 support preparation methods on the surface chemical composition quantitatively, the CeO2-Al2O3 supports were analyzed. The XPS spectra of the Ce 3d core electron levels for the calcined CeO2-Al2O3 supports are depicted in Fig. 9 . Three pairs of spin-orbit doublets were observed to fit into the six small peaks in the spectrum of CeO2. The peaks labeled as v (882.0eV), v″ (886.9eV) and v‴ (898.3eV) are ascribed to the Ce 3d5/2 spin orbit component whereas the peaks present at 900.9eV, 906.0eV, and 916.4eV corresponded to u, u″, and u‴, respectively, belong to Ce 3d3/2 component [25,38,51,56,57]. Moreover, the satellite peak of Ce 3d3/2 (u‴) at a binding energy of 916.4eV is the characteristic of the transition from the Ce 3d104f0 initial state into the Ce 3d94f0 O 2p6 configuration or Ce4+ state [37,38,46,57]. Compared to CeO2, not only the three pairs of spin-orbit doublets, but also the growth of the v′ (884.2eV) and u′ (902.4eV) peaks was found in the spectrum of Ce 3d for all the CeO2-Al2O3 samples. These peaks are related to the Ce 3d9 4f1 O 2p6 configuration ascribed to the Ce3+ state. To verify the presence of the different oxidation states of Ce, the area percentage of the u‴ peak (%u‴) in the total Ce 3d region, Ce 3d5/2 and Ce 3d3/2, is used to describe the relative intensity of Ce4+ in the samples [37], as presented in Table 5 . It was found that the values of the %u‴ for all the CeO2-Al2O3 supports were lower than that for the CeO2 calcined at 800°C which is 13.4% as reported in the work of Shyu et al. [37]. The lowest %u‴ (∼7.1%) was measured in the CeAl_SS support while it was 11.0% and 12.4% for CeAl_IS and CeAl_IC, respectively, close to that of CeO2, suggesting that the Ce species on the Al2O3 support for CeAl_SS resembles Ce3+. This was due to the strong interaction between Ce and Al2O3 forming CeAlO3 [37,38]. As it can be seen in Fig. 9, the appearance of v′ and the diminution of the v component confirmed that the Ce configuration had crept into the Ce3+ ion state. The intensity ratios of v′ and v (I(v′/v)), summarized in Table 5, show that the CeAl_SS support had the higher value of I(v′/v), as compared to that of CeO2 (0.41) reported in the literature [25]. The higher intensity ratio, I(v′/v), with lower area percentage of u‴ for the CeAl_SS support demonstrated that the Ce3+ state was the main component in the electronic Ce configuration followed by CeAl_IS and CeAl_IC. By using the following equation [44], the concentration of Ce3+ on the surface of the CeO2-Al2O3 supports can be evaluated and the results are shown in Table 5. (7) % Ce 3+ = I v 0 + I v' + I u 0 + I u' ∑ ( I Ce 3+ + I Ce 4+ ) × 100 The Ce3+ concentration on the surface of the CeAl_SS was the highest while those of CeAl_IS and CeAl_IC supports were similar, confirming that the Ce3+ ion state was a predominant species on the CeAl_SS surface. The surface atomic ratio, Ce/Al, obtained from the intensity of the elemental peak normalized by the relative sensitivity factor, is also given in Table 5. The lowest Ce/Al ratio was observed in the CeAl_SS support, followed by CeAl_IC and CeAl_IS, respectively. This evidently confirms the greater incorporation of the Ce species into the Al2O3 structure forming CeAlO3 perovskite species during the condensation and gelation process in the single pot sol-gel preparation method than the impregnation methods. In addition, it was confirmed that larger Ce entity had been exposed on the surface of the promoted support prepared by the impregnation method, especially CeAl_IS support. This could be attributed to the nature of the impregnation method that allows the simultaneous adsorption and deposition of ceria precursors on the Al2O3 surface. The Ce/Al ratio of CeAl_IS being higher than that of CeAl_IC could have been due to the pore characteristic of the Al2O3 support. The slit-like plate with a wide pore mouth of Al_C provided paths for transporting and depositing ceria precursors inside the pores more easily than did the ink-bottle pore structure of Al_S. Additionally, it was found that the binding energies of O 1s for the supports derived solely by sol-gel and impregnated on sol-gel derived alumina, CeAl_SS and CeAl_IS, are in between that of pure CeO2 (529.5eV) and pure Al2O3 (531.3eV) while the CeAl_IC has the value at 531.6eV which is close to that of pure Al2O3. It clearly reveals that the interaction between CeO2 and Al2O3 is attributed to the Ce-O-Al interaction [25,38] forming CeAlO3 perovskite structure which can be initiated on the mesoporous structure of xerogel support. These XPS results are in accordance with the above characterization results."
7,Catalytic activity in steam reforming of glycerol,"3.2 Catalytic activity in steam reforming of glycerol The glycerol steam reforming is complex and comprises a variety of reaction pathways to produce several liquid and gaseous products. Since all the catalysts convert glycerol completely, with the known conversions of glycerol to gaseous and solid (coke-deposited) products, the conversion to liquid product can be calculated from the mass balance: {(C in liquid product)=(C in feed) – (C in gas product) – (C in solid product)}. As shown in Table 6, gas is the main product, followed by smaller amounts of liquid and solid products, respectively. The glycerol conversion into gas products and the gas product yields as functions of time-on-stream of all the catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 10 . In terms of glycerol conversion into the gas phase, the NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS exhibited high average values (during 2–20h) of 88.5% and 84.9%, respectively, whilst the value was much lower for NiCeAl_IC (69.7%). More importantly, the conversions over both the NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts were steadily high throughout the reaction period. On the other hand NiCeAl_IC showed a high average conversion of 82.9% up to 13h before dropping rapidly to 38.0% towards the end of the reaction period. The rapid decrease of the conversion into the gas phase is an indication of a severe deactivation of NiCeAl_IC, which is discussed in the next section. In considering the gas products, all the catalysts provided the same major types, which were H2, CO and CO2, with small contents of CH4 as shown in Fig. 10 with their yields. The trends of H2 yield for all the catalysts were similar to that of the glycerol conversion into the gas phase. The high average H2 yields for NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts at 66.7% and 64.4%, respectively, were obtained whereas the NiCeAl_IC catalyst provided a lower value at 44.4%. The average H2 yields in terms of the moles of H2 per mole of glycerol during 20h of the reaction were 4.7, 4.5 and 3.1 for the NiCeAl_SS, NiCeAl_IS, and NiCeAl_IC catalysts, respectively. The values for the catalysts supported on the sol-gel derived support were much closer to the theoretical value (∼6mol H2 per 1mol of glycerol) [58–62] and even more on the traditional alumina. For the CO2 and CO yields, the average CO2 yield was greater than the average CO yield for both NiCeAl_SS (45.6% vs. 38.9%) and NiCeAl_IS (45.0% vs 36.8%), but the yields were about the same for NiCeAl_IC. The greater CO2 yield resulted from the water-gas-shift reaction, which is strongly promoted by CeO2 [31,41,63,64]. The CeO2 particles of NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS were more dispersed than that of NiCeAl_IC, thereby better enhancing the water-gas-shift reaction. In addition, CO was oxidized by the surface oxygen vacancies of CeO2 [31]. Contrary to the H2, CO, and CO2 yields, the average CH4 yields were about 4% and 3% over NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS, respectively, and were significantly less than that on the catalyst supported on the traditional alumina, NiCeAl_IC (6%). In addition, traces of C2H6 and C2H4 were detected solely on the NiCeAl_IC catalyst. This could possibly be attributed to the high surface area and the well-developed mesoporosity of sol-gel derived supports, which give the high number of active sites of the NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts. The steam reforming as well as the gasification of the adsorbed hydrocarbons on the catalyst’s surface were thereby enhanced [27]. The traces could also be due to the presence of CeO2 and CeAlO3. The CeAlO3 species was oxidized to form the CeO2 species by capturing with CO2 and the active CeO2 reacted with the hydrocarbon species adsorbed at the Ni-support boundary and restored to the CeAlO3 species [65]. The average selectivities of the gas products as summarized in Table 6 showed trends similar to those of the yields. These results show that the catalysts supported on the sol-gel-derived ceria-alumina xerogel were more active and stable than was the catalyst supported on the commercial non-xerogel alumina. The higher catalytic activity of NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts than NiCeAl_IC catalyst principally results from the greater number and dispersion of active Ni species, and the reducibility of NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts than those of the NiCeAl_IC catalyst, as observed in the H2-chemisorption, TPR, XAS, and XPS results, respectively. The qualitative results of the liquid products provide important information for comprehending the reaction pathway. The liquid products found in the condensable phase can be categorized into three main groups: (i) compounds with 3 carbon atoms hydroxyacetone (acetol), 1,2-propanediol, acetone, 1-propanol, propanal, allyl alcohol, and propionic acids), (ii) fewer than 3 carbon atoms (acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetic acid, methanol, and formic acid), and (iii) more than 3 carbon atoms (2 cyclopentenone and phenol). The common products detected for all the catalysts were acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, propanal, allyl alcohol, and phenol. The products detected only for the two Ni catalysts supported on the CeO2-Al2O3 oxides prepared by impregnation, NiCeAl_IC and NiCeAl_IS, were hydroxyacetone (acetol), 1,2-propanediol, formic acid, and acetic acid whereas propionic acid, ethylene glycol, and 2-cyclopentanone were detected only on NiCeAl_IC. Based on these products and referring to the published works [7,15,35,66–70], the reaction pathways of glycerol conversion in the steam reforming process can be outlined and shown in Fig. 11 . There are four main reaction routes of glycerol consisting of three types of reactions: dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and dehydration. These reactions represent the effects of the bifunctional metal-acid properties of the catalysts [66]. The first and the second routes of glycerol dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis generate a common product, such as ethylene glycol, which is converted to acetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and ethanol. The hydrogenolysis of glycerol also produces methanol. The third route is the glycerol dehydration to hydroxyacetone (acetol), which can be converted simultaneously in three ways to form a variety of products. The detected products verifying this pathway are 1,2 propanediol, acetone, propanal, 1-propanol, acetaldehyde, ethanol, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, 2-cyclopentanone, and phenol. This pathway is caused by the activation of the terminal OH of glycerol on the Lewis acid sites, which is represented by the strong acid sites of the catalysts [71]. The fourth pathway is another glycerol dehydration reaction producing 3-hydroxypropanal, which is a starting reactant for the production of several chemicals. The species observed and confirming this pathway include allyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, methanol, formic acid, C2H4, and C2H6. This pathway involves the protonation of the secondary OH of glycerol to form acrolein, which favors the Brønsted acid sites mainly represented by the moderate acid sites that were classified [71]. The increase of the acid sites in NiCeAl_SS was mostly contributed by the increase of the CeAlO3 phase. It has been reported that dehydration and dehydrogenation favor the acidity of support surfaces [66–68] such as alumina and CeAlO3. All the acids (formic, acetic, and propionic), which were the condensable products obtained near the end of the pathways, were not detected on NiCeAl_SS whilst only propionic acid was not detected on NiCeAl_IS. These products could be catalytically reformed or hydrogenolyzed to smaller molecules such as H2, CO, and CO2 on the active nickel sites [72–74]. With the higher number of active sites and Brønsted acid sites, NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS promoted the hydrogenolysis and dehydration/dehydrogenation of the acids to gaseous products, H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 [66,68], respectively, better than did NiCeAl_IC. It was clearly shown that among the three catalysts, the Ni catalyst supported on CeO2-Al2O3 prepared by the single-step sol-gel method was the most active one for glycerol steam reforming for producing hydrogen gas."
8,Characterization of spent catalysts,"3.3 Characterization of spent catalysts 3.3.1 Crystalline structure of the catalysts The XRD patterns of the spent NiCeAl_SS, NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts after performing the glycerol steam reforming are illustrated in Fig. 12 . In addition to the phases found in the freshly reduced catalysts, the characteristic peaks of the carbon species and corundum or α-Al2O3 were obtained. The peaks appearing at 26.3° (JCPDS 75-0444), and at 24.9° and 30.0° (JCPDS 74-2329) correspond to the two carbon species that had formed on the catalysts. It was clearly observed that the spent NiCeAl_IC catalyst had relatively greater intensities of the characteristic carbon peaks than did those of the spent NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts. Corundum or α-Al2O3, a more stable alumina phase, reflecting at 2-theta of 25.6°, 35.2°, 43.4°, and 57.5° was formed from the dehydration, followed by the sintering reaction of γ-Al2O3 [75–78]. Similar to the results of the catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition, the phase transformations of alumina in NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS were much less than that in NiCeAl_IC, as seen from the relatively lower intensities of the peaks corresponding to corundum in Fig. 12. Furthermore, after performing the reforming reaction, the crystallite size of Ni on NiCeAl_IC increased more than twice that of the freshly reduced catalyst (6.9nm vs. 14.7nm) whereas it increased about one-third for both the spent NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts, as shown by the values in Table 2. The increase of Ni particle size is due to sintering during the reaction causing the deactivation of the catalysts especially NiCeAl_IC [31,79,80]. Apart from the carbon formation and the transformation of γ-Al2O3, decreases in the CeO2 characteristic peaks compared to all the freshly reduced catalysts, especially the NiCeAl_SS, were observed. This was attributed to the transformation of CeO2 to the CeOx and CeAlO3 phases, although no diffraction peaks of those phases had been found, owing to the highly-dispersed phases of CeOx and CeAlO3. It was confirmed that the CeAlO3 species had formed during the reaction. 3.3.2 Coke formation The types of carbon species that had formed on the spent NiCeAl_SS, NiCeAl_IS and NiCeAl_IC catalysts were investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Their TGA profiles and derivatives are shown in Fig. 13 . Three main losses were observed in all of the spent catalysts with different extents and temperatures. The initial loss below 200°C is related to the removal of moisture and CO2 adsorbed when the catalysts were kept under air at atmospheric pressure followed by the loss of the easily oxidized carbonaceous species [81,82]. The thermal decomposition of physisorbed carbonaceous products, termed as soft-coke, onto the catalyst surface occurs at the second step of the weight reduction between the temperatures of 200°C and 400°C. When the temperature was continuously elevated from 400°C to 750°C, a major decrease in the sample weight indicated the gasification of the bulky carbonaceous species or hard coke, generating CO and CO2 (COx) [31,83,84]. The hard coke species in the range of 500–600°C is associated with filamentous coke whilst it is graphitic carbon species for the higher temperature range of 600–700°C. The spent NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts exhibited graphitic coke species at similar maximum temperatures of 647°C and 658°C, respectively, whereas both the filamentous and graphitic coke species appeared at 573°C and 682°C, respectively, for the spent NiCeAl_IC catalyst. This graphitic carbon is an inert coke that scarcely reacts with oxygen or steam [85]. From the area under the peak derivatives displayed in Fig. 13, the deactivation rate in terms of coke yield in the solid product was obtained and shown in Table 6 . The table shows that NiCeAl_IC had been severely deactivated by coke formation at a coke yield of 9.6mmolCgcat −1 h−1 whilst the deactivation was much less pronounced on NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS (0.6 and 1.4mmolCgcat −1 h−1, respectively). In other words, the amount of graphitic carbon over the spent NiCeAl_IC catalyst was greater and more difficult to oxidize than those over the NiCeAl_SS and NiCeAl_IS catalysts because the steam reforming of glycerol over the NiCeAl_IC catalyst had produced larger amounts of CO, CH4, and C2 species than had the other catalysts. These gases were the initiating species of the coke deposited as some of them underwent a further Boudouard reaction, methane decomposition, and polymerization, respectively [31,83], forming different coke species on the catalyst surface. As previously mentioned, with the redox property of CeO2, some of the CO and carbon species that had formed could have been oxidized by the surface oxygen atoms of CeO2. However with the higher content of dispersed CeAlO3 in NiCeAl_SS, these carbon species were close to complete oxidization, thereby giving markedly low coke yields. A similar result of coke deactivation on the Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 prepared by the same impregnation method can be found in the work of Profeti et al. [12]. Comparing the results to those of the previous work [10,12,13] on glycerol steam reforming over Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts prepared using different methods at similar operating condition as shown in Table 7 , the catalyst prepared by the single-step sol-gel method in this work displayed remarkable activity and stability by giving the highest H2 yield of 80% and the lowest coke formation (5–28 times lower)."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, three CeO2-Al2O3 oxides were prepared by a single-step sol-gel method and impregnation of cerium precursors on two types of Al2O3, of which one was a commercial alumina whilst the other was a prepared xerogel. These oxides were investigated for their physical and chemical properties, as well as their effects on the catalytic behaviors of the Ni catalysts supported on these oxides towards glycerol steam reforming reaction. The different pore structures of CeO2-Al2O3 were strongly affected by the original textural properties of the Al2O3 supports. The high surface area supports with narrow pore size distributions and mesoporous structures were achieved when the promoted supports, CeAl_SS and CeAl_IS, were derived based on sol-gel method. The mesoporous support generated by the sol-gel method enhances the incorporation of the Ce species into the Al2O3 structure to form a CeAlO3 perovskite structure more than does the traditional method. The formation of this species suppresses any strong interaction between the nickel species and the Al2O3 support, thereby increasing the number of active sites and the reducibility of the active nickel species. Another important contribution of the CeAlO3 phase to the oxide is to increase in Brønsted acid sites. Hence, the Ni active sites combined with the Brønsted acid sites promote the hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation-dehydration of the bifunctional metal-acid Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst, thereby converting more condensable intermediates into gaseous products, as well as leading to higher glycerol conversion and H2 yield in glycerol steam reforming. In addition, CeAlO3 strongly inhibits coke formation, Ni sintering, and the transformation of the alumina phase, thereby producing excellent stability in the catalyst. Consequently, the single-step sol-gel method is a promising method for preparing CeO2-Al2O3 support of a Ni catalyst utilized in glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production."
