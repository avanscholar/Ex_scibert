0,Introduction,"The photocatalytic process has gained a lot of attention in recent years as an environmentally friendly technology (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2021b). This process can use renewable solar energy to perform a chemical reaction at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. While the photocatalytic degradation of pollutant into nontoxic compounds is the most investigated photocatalytic process (Rueda-Marquez et al., 2020), the photocatalytic synthesis of valuable chemicals is another approach which has a bright perspective. In contrast to the photocatalytic degradation that aims to oxidize the compounds and transform them into non-toxic chemicals, the purpose of photocatalytic synthesis is to transform the compounds into value-added chemicals (Islam et al., 2020). Many pieces of research have been conducted in recent years on the photocatalytic transformation of renewable materials into value-added products (Tahir, 2018). Alcohols are a kind of renewable materials that can be easily produced from renewable sources and could represent, therefore, an appealing feedstock for future bio-refineries (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2021a). Around 0.1 t of crude glycerol is generated during the production of each ton of biodiesel, i.e., glycerol is a major by-product of biodiesel production (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2020a). As the glycerol market is limited, the overproduction of glycerol has led to a significant drop in its price in (Meier et al., 2020). Ethanol, as the most often used simple alcohol, can be generated from the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes (Puga, 2016). This alcohol has widespread application as feedstock in the chemical industry and it is used as a precursor for different organic compounds. Methanol is another renewable alcohol that can be generated by direct pyrolysis of raw lignocelluloses (Liu et al., 2014). From a sustainable point of view, the conversion of these alcohols into valuable chemicals using photocatalytic process has great potential (Colmenares and Luque, 2014). Nevertheless, selective conversion of these alcohols is still a significant challenge because of the variety of generated products. The focus of most previous studies on the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols has been on the production of hydrogen, as a green and high-energy carrier (Chai, 2021). This process leads however to a significant amount of CO2, with longstanding impacts. A greener approach is the conversion of alcohols into both hydrogen and value-added carbon-containing substances, accompanied by the production of less CO2 (Garcia-Lopez et al., 2021). The alcohols can also be converted to gaseous carbon-containing compounds such as CO (for the synthesis of ammonia) (Zou and Arakawa, 2003) and CH4 (fuel or feedstock) (Bashir and Idriss, 2017). On the other hand, liquid-phase carbon-containing products can be generated from alcohols, during which no or less CO2 is ideally produced since the liquid products contain a high number of carbon atoms. For example, the generation of formaldehyde was reported in the case of methanol (Zou and Arakawa, 2003) and Hwang et al. showed that acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and acetic acid could be produced through photocatalytic conversion of ethanol (Hwang and Raftery, 1999). Glycerol has three hydroxyl groups and therefore, it has a great potential to be converted into a wide range of liquid products such as glyceraldehyde (Montini et al., 2011), dihydroxyacetone (Minero et al., 2012), formic acid (Augugliaro et al., 2010), glycolaldehyde (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013), acetaldehyde (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013), tartronic acid (Minero et al., 2012), propylene glycol (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013), ethanol (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013), methylglyoxal (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013), dimethyl-1,4-dioxane (Montini et al., 2011), formaldehyde (Augugliaro et al., 2010), hydroxypyruvic acid (Minero et al., 2012), ethylene glycol (Montini et al., 2011), glycolic acid (Minero et al., 2012), acetone (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013), and methanol (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013). It is worth mentioning that among these works only (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013) analyzed simultaneously the gas and liquid phase products. For a possible implementation of the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols into practice, suitable conversion and selectivity of products are required. To achieve this purpose, the previous works mainly focused on the development of novel catalytic materials such as Bi2WO6 (Zhang et al., 2014), Bi/Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55 (Zhao et al., 2019), and AuxCu-CuS@TiO2 (Guo et al., 2018). On the other hand, a few works integrated innovative techniques such as encapsulation of photocatalyst into a silica matrix to entrap hydroxyl radicals (Zhang et al., 2014) or addition of hydrogen peroxide to generate further hydroxyl radicals (Jedsukontorn et al., 2016). The optimization of process operating parameters is an effective and fundamental approach that can significantly affect both conversion and selectivity. Various operating parameters influence the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols, such as pH (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019c), alcohol concentration (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019b), light intensity (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2020b), catalyst load (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019a), and co-catalyst content (Dosado et al., 2015). In one of our previous works we analyzed the relative importance of the operating parameters of a photocatalytic conversion process and showed that catalyst load, pH, and alcohol concentration are important factors that can significantly affect the rate of photocatalytic transformation (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2017). To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no work related to the effect of operating parameters on the type and distribution of gas and liquid phase products of photocatalytic conversion of alcohols. The present study focuses on the investigation of the effect of operating parameters on the type, rate, and distribution of gas and liquid products in the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols. In this regard, methanol, ethanol, and glycerol were selected as representative alcohols and their photocatalytic conversion was studied in different operating conditions. The experiments were conducted at different photocatalyst loads, pH, and alcohol concentrations, and the gas and liquid phase products were analyzed. In addition to the type and amount of products, the alcohol conversion and the product selectivity were evaluated. Finally, based on the obtained results, reaction mechanisms were proposed for the photocatalytic conversion of the three alcohols. All information related to “Materials and methods” (Section S1), as well as the Figs. S1–S6, are given in the Supporting Information."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Gas-phase products generation,"2.1 Gas-phase products generation The gas-phase products were analyzed to evaluate the effect of photocatalyst load, pH, and alcohol concentration on the type and distribution of products. H2, CO2, CH4, and CO were detected in the gas phase. The analysis of H2 generation helped in the comparison with the carbon-containing products generation and the development of the reaction mechanism (Section 2.3), as well as in the comparison of the current results with available studies on alcohol valorization. It is worth mentioning that unlike the previous works, which reported the generation of CO from methanol (Naldoni et al., 2013) and ethanol (Bashir and Idriss, 2017), no CO was detected in this research from either methanol or ethanol. It shows that in these cases sufficient hole was available for complete oxidation of alcohols (Wu et al., 2008). Only at high concentrations of glycerol (more than 95%), CO generation was observed (see Fig. 3d). The photocatalyst load could have a significant influence on the rate of photocatalytic reactions, as well as on the distribution of products, by changing the number of accessible active reaction sites (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2017). The effect of the photocatalyst load on the gas phase products is depicted in Fig. 1 . Concerning the effect of photocatalyst load on the amount of H2 production (Fig. 1a), it can be seen that by increasing the photocatalyst load up to 0.5 g/L, the amount of H2 production from glycerol increased significantly; however, the increase was insignificant at higher photocatalyst loads up to 5 g/L. In the case of methanol and ethanol, a maximum amount of H2 production was observed at 1.5 g/L and 3 g/L, respectively. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that at catalyst loads lower than the optimum value, the adsorption of photons by photocatalyst is not complete (Moradi et al., 2015). On the other hand, at photocatalyst loads much higher than the optimum value, uniform adsorption of photons of light does not occur and the photons cannot reach the depth of solution (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2017). It is also observed from Fig. 1a that the amount of produced hydrogen from glycerol is higher compared to methanol and ethanol, in the entire range of photocatalyst load. In addition, slightly larger hydrogen production is obtained from methanol in comparison to ethanol. Similar results were reported for the valorization of different alcohol–water mixtures (Al-Azri et al., 2015). The amount of generated CO2 at different photocatalyst loads is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The trend of generated CO2 is almost similar to that of H2 for the three alcohols, which confirms that hydrogen is derived from alcohols. Concerning the effect of photocatalyst load on the amount of CH4 generation (Fig. 1c), only for the case of ethanol a substantial amount of CH4 was generated. The generation of CH4 from ethanol was also mentioned in a kinetic study of the photocatalyst reactions (Bashir and Idriss, 2017). The optimum amount of CH4 from ethanol is produced at a photocatalyst load of 3 m/L, similar to the case of H2 and CO2 generation. In the photocatalytic reactions, the solution pH could change the reaction path by affecting the photocatalyst agglomeration and adsorption of reactants on the surface active sites (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019c). The effect of pH on the gas phase products is shown in Fig. 2 . As seen from Fig. 2a, hydrogen is produced to a larger extent at acidic pH, which can be due to a higher dispersion of TiO2 in this condition (lower catalyst agglomeration) (Vero et al., 2009). The catalyst agglomeration not only affects the alcohol conversion process but also the deposition of Pt on the surface of TiO2 during the photodeposition stage. The amount of hydrogen production is maximum around a pH of 4. It can be attributed to the fact that pH of 4 is far from (i) the isoelectric point of TiO2 (≈6.8 (Feilizadeh et al., 2015)) where TiO2 particles agglomerate, and (ii) the p K a 1 of TiO2 (≈2.4 (Kormann et al., 1991)) where OH groups dissociate on the surface of TiO2 (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019c). It should be noted that at a pH near the isoelectric point, almost no electrostatic potential exists between TiO2 particles, and therefore, there is no interaction between the particles which leads to their agglomeration. In contrast to our previous work (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019c), a minimum is observed at a pH of 10. This behavior is attributed to the difference in Pt deposition on TiO2 surface: by ex-situ photodeposition (previous work) compared to in-situ photodeposition (this work), which was chosen because of the higher efficiency for hydrogen generation (Jiang et al., 2015). It was reported that the pH affects the in-situ photodeposition through the formation of Pt particles with different oxidation states (Wenderich and Mul, 2016). During the photodeposition of Pt at neutral pH, both Pt and PtO2 can be deposited, while only PtO2 could be formed at pH values higher than 9 (Xi et al., 1995). Fig. 2b shows the amount of CO2 generation at different pH. As also noticed above, the effect of pH on the amount of CO2 production is almost similar to that of hydrogen, which confirms that hydrogen derives from alcohols. It can be seen that a higher extent of CO2 is produced from glycerol and methanol compared to ethanol. Regarding the effect of pH on CH4 generation (Fig. 2c) the amount of CH4 is considerable from ethanol only. The maximum CH4 generation is observed at a pH of 4, similar to the pH corresponding to the maximum hydrogen and CO2 production from ethanol (Fig. 2a). This observation suggests the ethanol conversion could be maximized at a pH of 4. The substrate concentration is another significant factor in photocatalytic reactions that could influence the rate and path of reaction by changing the number of adsorbed molecules on the surface of photocatalyst (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019a). Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of alcohol concentration on gas-phase products. Around 5–70% glycerol is required for a high amount of hydrogen production, which reaches a maximum of 50% (Fig. 3a). This result coincides with previous works reporting the highest rate of hydrogen production at a glycerol concentration of around 50% (Slamet and Valentina, 2013) and 53.6% (López et al., 2015). 50% glycerol concentration (which is around 3.94:1 (glycerol: water) molar ratio) is close to the 3:1 stoichiometric molar ratio of glycerol reaction with water (Equation (3)). According to Fig. 3a, extremely low and high glycerol concentrations caused a significant decrease in the amount of produced hydrogen (at 0.1% and 99.9%, it decreases around 3.1 and 4.7 times in comparison to 50%, respectively). This shows that the amount of produced hydrogen enhances by increasing the glycerol concentration from 0.1% up to 50% because of rising the number of adsorbed glycerol on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, at concentrations higher than 50% the amount of produced hydrogen decreases due to the prevention of efficient adsorption of hydronium cations on the catalyst surface by glycerol (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2017). For the case of methanol, the amount of produced hydrogen increases significantly up to 10% methanol, then remaining almost constant up to 99%. Only at an extensive concentration of 99.9%, the amount of produced hydrogen decreased. A continuous increase in the amount of produced hydrogen by increasing the methanol concentration was already observed in previous works (Xu and Sun, 2009). This behavior follows the Langmuir-type isotherm (Karimi Estahbanati et al., 2019a) and implies that the adsorption of methanol is a significant step in its conversion. For the case of ethanol, hydrogen production increases significantly up to 5%, followed by a slight improvement up to 99%. Similar to the case of methanol, the amount of produced hydrogen decreased for 99.9% of ethanol. Interestingly, the current results show that the amount of hydrogen enhances around 2.7 and 340 times when ethanol concentration rises from 0 to 0.1% and 1%, respectively. This observation implies that at least 1% ethanol is required to generate a reasonable amount of hydrogen. The analysis of hydrogen generation by different alcohols shows that, in general, the amount of hydrogen obeys the order of glycerol > methanol > ethanol (Figs. 1a, 2a and 3a), which is similar to the obtained results in the previous works (Chen et al., 2015). This trend is because the amount of produced hydrogen is a function of the number of α-H in alcohol molecule which obeys a similar trend for the three alcohols (Chen et al., 2015). The higher surface coverage of ethanol on the TiO2 surface than methanol which leads to a higher number of adsorbed methanol on the surface can be another reason for more hydrogen generation from methanol (Chen et al., 1999). Fig. 3b depicts the effect of alcohol concentration on the amount of produced CO2. As seen, for all the alcohols the amount of detected CO2 decreased by increasing the alcohol concentration. The reason for this behavior can be the increase in CO2 solubility at high alcohol concentrations (Hadi et al., 2013). The generated CO2 through the conversion of alcohols at high alcohol concentrations dissolved in the liquid phase, and its concentration decreased in the gas phase. The amount of detected CH4 in the gas phase is depicted in Fig. 3c. Similar to the case of photocatalyst load and pH, CH4 was produced only from ethanol. The trend of CH4 generation is close to the trend of hydrogen production (Fig. 3a), though the amount of produced CH4 decreased at high ethanol concentrations that would be attributed to the higher solubility of CH4 at elevated alcohol concentrations (Wise et al., 2016). For instance, Wise et al. (2016) showed that by increasing ethanol concertation in aqueous solution from 50 to 70 wt%, the solubility of methane increases more than 10 times. Analysis of the CO generation (Fig. 3d) illustrates that not only no CO was produced from methanol and ethanol but also it was generated only at 95% glycerol and higher concentrations. It is also observed that 4.6 times more CO is produced by increasing the glycerol concentration from 95% to 99%. It demonstrates the significance of the presence of water for the complete oxidation of glycerol."
3,Liquid-phase products generation,"2.2 Liquid-phase products generation The liquid phase products in the photocatalytic alcohol conversion process were analyzed to investigate the effect of photocatalyst load, pH, and alcohol concentration on the type, amount, yield, and selectivity of the liquid products. Various liquid phase products were generated; however, formaldehyde and formic acid were common in the three alcohols. Since the liquid phase products were different for each alcohol, the effect of the abovementioned operating parameters is investigated individually for each alcohol in the following subsections. 2.2.1 Analysis of liquid-phase products from methanol The effect of operating parameters on the photocatalytic generation of liquid products from methanol is demonstrated in Fig. 4 . As seen, formaldehyde and formic acid were the generated liquid phase products. This figure also shows the amount of generated formaldehyde was much higher than formic acid in all the conditions, except at high methanol concentration. As seen in Fig. 4a, the production trend of formaldehyde and formic acid was similar at different photocatalyst loads. The optimum photocatalyst load for the production of liquid products from methanol photoreforming was obtained at 1.55 g/L. Since the rate of hydrogen production was also maximum at this photocatalyst load (Fig. 1a), it can be concluded that the rate of methanol conversion was maximum at 1.55 g/L. Fig. 4b illustrates the effect of pH on the generation of liquid products. In general, the amount of produced formaldehyde in acidic pH was more than basic condition. At pH of 4 and 10, the highest and lowest amount of formaldehyde was produced, respectively, which is similar to the obtained results for the hydrogen generation (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the trend of formaldehyde and formic acid production was almost opposite, suggesting the transformation of formic acid to formaldehyde because of pH variation. As seen in Fig. 4c, the amount of formaldehyde production initially enhanced severely with increasing methanol concentration up to 10% and then decreased intensely with increasing it up to 30%. The amount of formaldehyde generation at a methanol concentration of 10% was around twice that at 1% and 30% concentrations. Further increasing the methanol concentration slightly decreased the amount of produced formaldehyde. Unlike formaldehyde, increasing the methanol concentration up to 70% had no significant effect on formic acid production. Subsequently, it increased the amount of formic acid generation sharply until reached a maximum at 99% methanol concentration. Fig. S1 demonstrates the yield of liquid products in methanol photoreforming. As seen, in all conditions the yield of formaldehyde was higher than formic acid. According to Figs. S1a and b, at different photocatalyst loads and pH, the yield of liquid products was lower than 1%. At low methanol concentrations of 0.1% and 1%, the formaldehyde yield reached 29% and 3%, respectively. Fig. S2 shows the selectivity of methanol photoreforming liquid products. In the whole range of investigated pH and photocatalyst load, the selectivity of formaldehyde and formic acid were around 100% and 0%, respectively (Figs. S2a and b). Only at methanol concentrations higher than 70%, the selectivity of formaldehyde and formic acid decreased and increased, respectively. Interestingly, at methanol percentages of 99% and 99.9%, the selectivity of formic acid reached its maximum value of around 50%. It can be concluded that the production of formic acid from methanol is feasible only at very high methanol concentrations. 2.2.2 Analysis of liquid-phase products from ethanol Acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and formic acid were detected as ethanol photoreforming liquid products. The effect of photocatalyst load, ethanol concentration, and pH on the amount of liquid products from ethanol are presented in Fig. 5 . Similar to the previous works, acetaldehyde was the main liquid phase product (Sola et al., 2016). Fig. 5a shows the effect of photocatalyst load on the generation of liquid products from ethanol. Acetaldehyde was the predominant product in the entire investigated photocatalyst load range. The acetaldehyde production enhanced around 2.5 and 3.1 times by increasing the photocatalyst load from 0.1 g/L to 0.5 and 3 g/L, respectively, while a further increase to 5 g/L had almost no effect. By increasing the photocatalyst load, the amount of produced formaldehyde and formic acid remained almost constant. The effect of pH on the generation of liquid products is demonstrated in Fig. 5b. This figure shows that in the whole pH range, acetaldehyde was the main product. It shows pH had no significant effect on formaldehyde production. The maximum amount of acetaldehyde was produced at pH = 4. A similar result was obtained for the effect of pH on the hydrogen generation, which shows the detached protons from ethanol during acetaldehyde generation were converted to hydrogen molecule. For the case of formic acid, its production decreased by increasing the pH. Fig. 5c depicts the effect of ethanol concentration on the generation of liquid products. According to this figure, the production rate of acetaldehyde reached a maximum of 70% concentration. Formaldehyde production was almost negligible up to 50% concentration, while augmented intensely with increasing the concentration and reached a maximum value at 99%. Interestingly, at very high ethanol concentrations (99% and 99.9%) almost only formaldehyde was produced. In addition, ethanol concentration had almost no effect on formic acid production. The effect of operating parameters on the yield of liquid products in ethanol photoreforming is illustrated in Fig. S3. In general, increasing the photocatalyst load increased the yield of acetaldehyde, but did not have a significant effect on the yield of formaldehyde and formic acid (Fig. S3a). The analysis of the effect of pH on the yield of liquid products showed the maximum yield of 5.8% was obtained for acetaldehyde at a pH of 4, while it had a negligible effect for formaldehyde and formic acid (Fig. S2b). The yield of formaldehyde was higher at very low (0.1%) and high (95%, 99%, and 99.9%) ethanol concentrations (Fig. S3c). The selectivity of liquid-phase products in the ethanol photoreforming is shown in Fig. S4. In the investigated photocatalyst load range, the selectivity of acetaldehyde was around 80% and much higher than formaldehyde and formic acid. As the photocatalyst load increased, the selectivity of acetaldehyde enhanced initially up to 0.5 g/L and then remained almost constant. The selectivity of acetaldehyde was higher than 80% in the whole pH range and the maximum selectivity was obtained at a pH of 4. By further increasing the pH, the selectivity of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde decreased and increased, respectively, suggesting the conversion of acetaldehyde to formaldehyde. The selectivity of acetaldehyde was enhanced severely with increasing ethanol concentration at first until it reached the maximum value of 87% at 10% ethanol concentration. By further increasing the ethanol concentration, the selectivity of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde decreased and increased, respectively, during which the selectivity of formaldehyde reached around 96% at the ethanol concentration of 99.9%. This observation suggests the conversion of acetaldehyde to formaldehyde at ethanol concentrations higher than 10%. A maximum of around 35% was obtained for formic acid selectivity at 1% ethanol concentration, while it was negligible at other concentrations. 2.2.3 Analysis of liquid-phase products from glycerol In the glycerol photoreforming, different products of acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, formic acid, glyceraldehyde, and hydroxyacetone were generated. Because of the vast range of products and the interaction effects, the analysis of liquid products of glycerol conversion is complicated. The amount of these products is shown in Fig. 6 as a function of photocatalyst load, pH, and glycerol concentration. According to Fig. 6a, the maximum amount of glyceraldehyde was produced at a photocatalyst load of 3 g/L. On the other hand, the amount of photocatalyst had almost no effect on formaldehyde production (around 30 g/L). Acetaldehyde was mainly produced at a very low photocatalyst load of 0.1 g/L and decreased at higher photocatalyst loads. Fig. 6b demonstrates the effect of pH on the amount of liquid products of glycerol photoreforming. According to this figure, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and hydroxyacetone reached a maximum at neutral pH. The highest amount of formic acid and glyceraldehyde was produced at pH of 2 and 10, respectively. From an economic point of view, the selective production of glyceraldehyde from glycerol, an abundant by-product of biodiesel production, can bring a significant added value to the biodiesel industry (El Roz et al., 2019). The effect of glycerol concentration on the amount of liquid products is shown in Fig. 6c. Interestingly, glycerol concentration did not pose significant effects on the distribution of liquid products, especially at concentrations higher than 30%. For all the liquid products a local maximum was observed at 99% glycerol concentration and for all the products except acetaldehyde, this maximum was also an absolute maximum. By increasing the glycerol concentration from 95% to 99%, the amount of all liquid phase products decreased significantly. Fig. S5 demonstrates the effect of operating parameters on the yield of products in glycerol photoreforming. In the whole range of photocatalyst load and pH, the yield of products in the liquid phase was less than 1%. While, significantly higher yields were obtained at 0.1 g/L of glycerol concentration, during which 30% yield was observed for glyceraldehyde at this concentration. At 0.1% glycerol concentration, the yields of the products were in the order of glyceraldehyde > formaldehyde > formic acid > acetaldehyde > hydroxyacetone. The selectivity of liquid products in the glycerol photoreforming is shown in Fig. S6. According to Fig. S6a, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde had the highest and the lowest selectivity among liquid products, respectively. The maximum selectivity of 35% was obtained for formaldehyde at 5 g/L of photocatalyst load. According to Fig. S6c, with increasing the glycerol concentration from 30% to 95%, the selectivity of almost all the products in the liquid phase increased and reached a maximum."
4,Proposed reaction mechanisms,"2.3 Proposed reaction mechanisms The mechanisms of photocatalytic glycerol, ethanol, and methanol conversion were proposed based on the obtained results. Eqs. (1)–(3) show the overall reaction of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol conversion to hydrogen and CO2, with the assumption of the complete conversion of alcohols and intermediates, respectively. (1) C H 3 O H + H 2 O → C O 2 + 3 H 2 (2) C 2 H 5 O H + 3 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 6 H 2 (3) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 3 C O 2 + 7 H 2 As seen, for the stoichiometric conversion of 1 mol of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol, 1, 3, and 3 mol of water are required to produce 3, 6, and 7 mol of hydrogen, respectively. These values show a higher amount of hydrogen production from glycerol, as was found in the current work. It is noteworthy that in this work these stoichiometric values were not observed because of partial oxidation of alcohols, i.e., the liquid products are also generated. It can also be inferred from Eqs. (1)–(3) that the complete oxidation of 1 mol of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol generates 1, 2, and 3 mol of CO2, respectively, which is not eco-friendly. To reduce the CO2 emissions, it is therefore essential to study the corresponding reaction mechanisms and develop strategies for the optimization of selective production of value-added carbon-containing products. An overall mechanism for photocatalytic conversion of the alcohols is presented in Fig. 7 . As seen, the first step is the adsorption of a photon of light by TiO2 which leads to the formation of an electron-hole pair (e−/h+). These photogenerated species can trigger a series of reactions. For example, the reaction of photogenerated electrons with either H+ or H2O can generate a H • . Afterward, two H • can react to produce a hydrogen molecule (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013). The photogenerated holes can react directly with (i) alcohol (hole-mediated mechanism) and produce various products and intermediates or (ii) water to generate hydroxyl radicals. The produced hydroxyl radicals can then generate products by reacting with the alcohols or intermediates (radical-mediated mechanism). Accordingly, the generated intermediates can react with the photogenerated holes or hydroxyl groups to generate further oxidized products. The complete photoreforming of alcohol eventually produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide (as is shown in Equations (1)–(3)) (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2013). During these reactions, H2, CO2, CH4, and CO can be generated as gaseous products. The detailed mechanisms of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol photoconversion are discussed in the following subsections. 2.3.1 Methanol conversion According to the experimental data, formaldehyde and formic acid were produced through the photoreforming of methanol. The proposed mechanism for the methanol conversion is presented in Fig. 8 . Accordingly, a photogenerated hole or a hydroxyl radical first attacks the methanol molecule, and then a proton is separated (Chiarello et al., 2011). The proton is more likely to be separated from the carbon atom than oxygen during the formation of hydroxymethyl radical ( • C H 3 O ) in the methanol photoreforming (Asmus et al., 1973). The hydroxymethyl radical then reacts with another photogenerated hole or hydroxyl radical to form a formaldehyde molecule (Kandiel et al., 2011). The generated formaldehyde oxidizes by a hole or hydroxyl radical to form formic acid in two steps, during which two protons are produced (López et al., 2015). Finally, formic acid is decarboxylated by the Photo-Kolbe reaction to generate carbon dioxide ( Fig. 8 ) (Miwa et al., 2010). During these reactions, six protons are generated which react with the photogenerated electrons to generate hydrogen molecules (see Fig. 7). 2.3.2 Ethanol conversion The mechanism of ethanol photoreforming begins with the hole attack to ethanol molecule and production of either acetaldehyde (Sola et al., 2016) or formaldehyde (Puga et al., 2014). The generated acetaldehyde is then converted to CH4 and CO, after which CO participates in the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) to produce CO2 and H2 (Barba-Nieto et al., 2020). On the other hand, ethanol can be converted to formaldehyde by losing a methane molecule (Wang et al., 2010). Afterward, formaldehyde is converted to formic acid in two steps by adsorbing a hole and hydroxyl radical and losing a proton (López et al., 2015). Finally, the generated formic acid converts to CO2, similar to the mechanism of methanol conversion (Fig. 9 ). The generated holes through these reactions react with the photogenerated electrons to produce hydrogen molecules. In addition, methane can react with a hydroxyl radical, produced from water photolysis, to convert to CO2 and H2 (Murcia-López et al., 2014). 2.3.3 Glycerol conversion The glycerol photoreforming mechanism is more complicated than that of methanol and ethanol, and diverse products can be produced (Seadira et al., 2018). The proposed reaction pathway for photocatalytic glycerol conversion based on the detected products is shown in Fig. 10 . According to this figure, glycerol initially converts to glyceraldehyde by dehydrogenation reaction (Callison et al., 2018). The evolution of glyceraldehyde can proceed in two ways: first, glyceraldehyde converts to hydroxyacetone through the hydrogenation reaction, and second, it converts to ethylene glycol through the decarbonylation reaction (Callison et al., 2018). It was reported that hydroxyacetone can be also directly obtained from glycerol dehydration (Velasquez et al., 2014). The generated hydroxyacetone then decomposes to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde (Gutiérrez Ortiz et al., 2016). Another path is also reported in the literature to produce acetaldehyde, during which the generated ethylene glycol participates in the dehydration reaction (Sanwald et al., 2018). The generated acetaldehyde converts to CO by losing a CH4 molecule. The formed CO can react rapidly with water to produce CO2 and H2 (WGSR) (Berto et al., 2016). The generated formaldehyde from hydroxyacetone is converted to formic acid and then CO2, similar to the pathway that was described in the mechanisms of methanol and ethanol photoreforming. The obtained hydrogen atoms react with the photogenerated electrons to produce a hydrogen molecule. The generated CH4 (Murcia-López et al., 2014) and CO (Barba-Nieto et al., 2020) through these reactions can convert to hydrogen and CO2."
5,Reduction of CO2 generation through the synthesis of carbon-containing products,"2.4 Reduction of CO2 generation through the synthesis of carbon-containing products As already discussed, the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols to both hydrogen and value-added carbon-containing products can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. To quantitatively compare the reduction of CO2 generation by this approach in comparison to the conventional approach of H2 production, the molar ratio of CO2/H2 was calculated for the conducted experiments. Fig. 11 compares the experimental CO2/H2 ratios with the corresponding theoretical values (horizontal lines) calculated based on Eqs. (1)–(3) for methanol, ethanol, and glycerol, respectively. In this figure, the tests # 1–5, 6–14, and 15–19 correspond to the analysis of the effects of photocatalyst load (0.1, 0.5, 1.55, 3, and 5 g/L), alcohol concentration (1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, 95, 99, and 99.9%), and pH (2, 4, 7, 10, and 12), respectively. As seen, the CO2 generation could be significantly lower than the theoretical values (horizontal lines) through the conversion of these alcohols to carbon-containing products. Moreover, almost no CO2 was detected in some cases. It can be inferred from Fig. 11 that the CO2/H2 ratios for methanol, ethanol, and glycerol are reduced in average around 2.5, 5.0, and 3.9 times in comparison with the theoretical values (Eqs. (1)–(3)), respectively. In addition, a very low CO2/H2 ratio (less than 0.04) is observed for all alcohols when the alcohol loading is 95, 99, or 99.9 (tests # 12–14). The implications of CO2 reduction are of great importance from both ecological and industrial points of view."
6,Conclusion,"Different kind of alcohols can be easily produced from renewable sources. As renewable materials, they represent, therefore, an appealing feedstock for future bio-refineries. Most previous research on the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols has been driven on hydrogen production, which is inevitably accompanied by the generation of CO2 as by-product. As a cleaner alternative, we investigated and optimized here a strategy to synthesize both hydrogen and carbon-containing value-added products from alcohols, by generating no or little CO2. For the first time, we studied the effect of operating parameters on the type, rate, and distribution of gas and liquid products in the photocatalytic conversion of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol as representative alcohols. The experiments were conducted at different photocatalyst loads, pH, and alcohol concentrations. The main results can be summarized as follows: • CO2/H2 ratio for methanol, ethanol, and glycerol can be reduced in average around 2.5, 5.0, and 3.9 times compared to the stoichiometric values by the generation of both hydrogen and carbon-containing value-added products from alcohols; • CO2/H2 ratio is very low (less than 0.04) for all the alcohols at alcohol concentrations higher than 95%. • hydrogen can be produced from all investigated alcohols and in all operating conditions, while CH4 was mainly produced from ethanol, and CO was only detected by glycerol conversion at concentrations higher than 95%; • methanol conversion leads to formaldehyde as the main product, with an excellent selectivity higher than 95%; • optimum production of formaldehyde from methanol occurs at 1.5 g/L photocatalyst load, pH of 4, and 10% methanol concentration; • acetaldehyde is the main product of ethanol conversion when ethanol concentration is lower than 70%; • the selectivity of formaldehyde produced from almost pure ethanol (99.9%) can reach very high values of around 96%; • optimum production of acetaldehyde from ethanol occurs at 5 g/L photocatalyst load, pH of 4, and ethanol concentration of 70%; • glycerol conversion leads to several liquid products like acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, formic acid, glyceraldehyde, and hydroxyacetone, with the highest selectivity for formaldehyde in most investigated conditions. • the proposed reaction mechanisms for all investigated alcohols are of high interest since they can help in future studies to increase the selectivity of value-added products by determining the path of parallel and series reactions. In conclusion, we showed that a thorough optimization of the operating parameters in the photocatalytic conversion of alcohols can lead to a cleaner generation of carbon-containing value-added products through the valorization of alcohols, while reducing the CO2 emissions. Since the generated value-added carbon-containing liquid products are usually commercially more valuable than the residual alcohols, it would be of interest to investigate strategies to increase the selectivity of these products in the future works. The approach used in this work could further be applied for other photocatalysts and bio-sourced feedstocks. Moreover, combining this conversion approach with the photocatalytic reduction of the CO2 produced, even in low amounts, to generate fuels and other value-added chemicals could result in the development of a CO2-free process."
