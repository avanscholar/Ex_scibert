0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant, renewable and environmentally friendly carbon resource [1]. Efficient utilization of biomass for the production of fuels and chemicals is beneficial for energy supply and environmental improvement. Furfural (FF) produced from biomass by acid-catalyzed dehydration of xylose, was identified as one of the twelve most valuable chemicals derived from biomass [2]. Many high value-added chemicals could be produced from FF by means of hydrogenation (Scheme 1 ), such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2-methylfuran (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and so on [3]. FA manufacture makes use of the most of the FF production capacity [4], since FA is used as a raw material for producing foundry resins, plastics, synthetic fibers and other fine chemicals [5]. FA was produced industrially by selectively catalyzed FF hydrogenation in gas or liquid phase [6]. The gas phase technology has the advantages of mild reaction conditions, high selectivity, environmental friendly and so forth [7]. Therefore, the production of FA by catalytic hydrogenation of FF in gas phase has attracted much attention nowadays. Copper chromite was the well-known commercial catalyst for gas phase FF hydrogenation [8]. Nevertheless, the presence of toxic chromium species would limit the application of copper chromite catalyst. The development of efficient chrome-free catalyst is urgently needed for sustainable commercial production of FA. Thus, several Cr-free catalysts including noble metals and transition metals such as Pt, Pd, Au, Ni as well as Cu were developed for the hydrogenation of FF in gas phase [9–13]. The silica, alumina, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, cerium oxide, metal organic framework and the like were used as support for these metal catalysts [14–20]. Among these catalysts, silica supported Cu catalysts have been the best choice for potential industrial application due to the relative low cost and high selectivity to FA [21]. Numerous silica supported copper catalysts synthesized by various methods for FA production in gas phase were reported [15,17,21–26]. Some efficient catalyst systems were developed. For example, ammonia evaporation induced homogeneous precipitation was developed using either colloidal silica or fumed silica as silicon source for the manufacture of silica supported copper catalysts [21,26]. The ammonia evaporation derived catalysts showed high selectivity to FA (>95%) and good catalyst lifetime. Sol-gel method using colloidal silica as support was also applied for the production of silica supported copper sample for FF hydrogenation to FA [22]. High FA selectivity and good stability were also observed over the sol–gel derived catalyst. Even though the good performance was obtained using the above catalyst systems, the usage of the colloidal silica or fumed silica also carries a high cost. Besides, the above catalyst synthetic methods involve complex steps that require careful control. And the final samples need to be extruded to produce the pellet catalyst. In all, these catalyst preparation methods usually contain complex steps with higher costs and require forming steps. On the contrary, impregnation was a simple preparation strategy and the synthetic process was easy to control. When commercial spherical silica is used as support, the cost will be reduced and the forming process will be eliminated. However, the impregnation derived silica supported copper catalysts for gas phase catalytic FF to FA exhibited unsatisfactory performance up to now [21–23,25]. Therefore, the development of modified impregnation was necessary for the preparation of FF hydrogenation to FA catalyst with excellent performance. Professor Ding has reported that highly dispersed Ir catalyst was obtained by simple impregnation method using primary alcohol treated silica as support [27]. Motivated by this work, the copper catalyst with high dispersion was synthesized by impregnation using ethanolamine modified granular silica as carrier. The derived catalyst was highly efficient for the gas phase catalytic hydrogenation of FF to FA. The catalyst preparation method involves simple steps and further molding is avoided. Meanwhile the cost of the catalyst preparation was low due to the application of commercial spherical silica as carrier. Furthermore, the ethanolamine modified granular silica supported copper catalyst exhibited excellent performance compared to original granular silica supported copper sample and commercial CuCr-Strem catalyst. The outstanding performance was resulted from the highly dispersed metallic copper and higher amount of surface Cu+."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The granular silica (40–60 mesh) was obtained from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd. Ethanolamine (C2H7NO, 99%) and copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O, 99.99%) were procured from Aladdin Industrial Inc. FF was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The chemicals were used directly without purification except for FF. FF was distilled before employ. A commercial copper catalyst (62–64% Cr2CuO4, 6% BaO and 0–4% graphite), which was labeled as CuCr-Strem, was purchased from Strem Chemicals."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Silica modification with ethanolamine: The granular silica (denoted as SiO2) was modified by ethanolamine. Typically, 5 g of SiO2 was added into 15 g of ethanolamine. The mixture was then stood overnight. Afterward, the mixture was dried at 363 K in water bath until no free liquid was observed. The solid was dried at 393 K for 12 h and calcined at 573 K for 3 h, respectively. Different amount of ethanolamine was used for the initial modification. The obtained ethanolamine modified granular silica was labeled as SiO2-x (x = 1, 2, 3 and 4), where the x represents the initial mass ratio between ethanolamine and silica in the pretreatment mixture. Supported copper catalyst preparation: The ethanolamine modified granular silica (SiO2-x) supported copper catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method similar to previous work [28]. The SiO2-x was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O and then set for 20 h at 298 K. The solid was dried at 393 K for 12 h and calcined at 623 K for 3 h, sequentially. The obtained samples were denoted as Cu/SiO2-x (x = 1, 2, 3 and 4). The unmodified granular silica supported copper catalyst was synthesized by the same manner. The obtained sample was denoted as Cu/SiO2. A reference copper catalyst (Cu/SiO2-AE) was synthesized by ammonia evaporation similar to our previous work using granular silica as silicon resource [21]. The nominal loading of copper in these catalysts was 15 wt%."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The N2 physisorption test was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 instrument. Around 50 mg sample was used for each test that was performed at liquid nitrogen temperature. The sample was degassed for 5 h at 573 K before measurement. The specific surface area (SBET) was estimated according to the N2 isotherm using the BET method. The total pore volume (Vp) was obtained from the N2 amount adsorbed at a relative pressure close to unity. The average pore size (Dp) was determined by the BJH method. The crystal structure of calcined sample was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The test was performed on a PANalytical X’Pert Powder equipment with Cu-Kα radiation over a 2θ range from 10° to 80° at 40 kV and 40 mA. The XRD pattern of freshly reduced catalyst was collected using the Anton Paar XRK 900 reaction chamber on a PANalytical X'Pert3 diffractometer. The calcined sample was loaded into the chamber and reduced in a flow of H2 in-situ at 523 K for 2 h. After reduction, the XRD pattern was collected directly ranging from 10° to 80° at 40 kV and 40 mA under H2. The H2-TPR (temperature programmed reduction in H2) experiment was conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II instrument. 100 mg of calcined sample was applied for one test. The sample was purged by argon at 393 K for 0.5 h followed by cooling to 323 K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 1073 K (10 K/min) in a flow of 5% H2/Ar mixture at 50 mL/min. The H2 consumption was recorded by TCD detector. The specific surface area of metallic Cu and copper dispersion were determined by N2O titration using a Micromeritics AutoChem II instrument. The experiment consisted of three steps: first, calcined sample (70 mg) was loaded into the reactor. The reactor was heated to 523 K from 323 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min under 5% H2/Ar. The consumed H2 was recorded by TCD and denoted as A. Secondly, the sample was cooled to 333 K and purged by Ar for 30 min at 333 K. A 10% N2O/Ar gas was admitted and lasted for 60 min to oxidize surface metallic copper to Cu2O. Finally, the sample was purged by Ar for 30 min and then cooled to 523 K. Afterward, the sample was heated to 773 K in a flow of 5% H2/Ar with a heating rate of 10 K/min. The consumed H2 was monitored by TCD and labeled as B. The dispersion (DCu) of metallic copper and exposed metallic copper specific surface (SCu) were calculated from the following formulas [29]: D C u = 2 × B A × 100 % S C u = 2 × B × N A A × M C u × 1.46 × 10 19 Where NA is Avogadro’s constant (6.02 × 1023 atoms mol−1), MCu is the molar mass of copper (63.546 g/mol), 1.46 × 1019 is the number of copper atoms per m2. The nature of surface copper in the freshly reduced samples was measured by near ambient pressure in-situ XPS using EnviroESCA. The calcined sample was pressed into sheet and fixed on the sample holder. Then, the sample was heated to 523 K and maintained for 2 h in a flow of 10% H2/Ar at 10 mbar. The XPS spectra of fresh catalysts were collected after the in-situ reduction. The C 1s peak at 284.8 eV was used as the reference. Copper particles distribution in the fresh catalysts and spent catalysts was analyzed by TEM using JEM-2100. The calcined samples were reduced in a flow of 10% H2/Ar at 523 K for 2 h and passivated at 298 K under 1% O2/Ar for 2 h successively. The obtained catalysts were denoted as fresh samples. The elemental analysis of calcined and spent catalysts was carried out on the VARIO Elementar. The thermo gravimetric analysis (TG) measurement of spent sample was performed on the NETZSCH STA 449 F3 under air flow (sample mass: 10 mg, flow rate: 20 mL/min, heating rate: 10 K/min)."
5,Catalytic performance evaluation,"2.4 Catalytic performance evaluation The hydrogenation of FF was performed in a stainless fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, calcined catalyst (1 g) was loaded into the center of the reactor. The catalyst was in-situ reduced at 523 K for 3 h under H2. Afterward, the reactor was cooled to the specified reaction temperature before FF was pumped into the reactor. The hydrogenation reaction was carried out under the following conditions: 403 K, H2/FF molar ratio of 12 and weight liquid hourly space velocity of FF (WHSV) of 0.4 h−1. The analysis of products was the same as our previous publication [21]. The calculation of FF conversion as well as product selectivity was based on the following equations. The carbon balance was well than 95%. F F c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = 100 - m o l e s o f F F r e s i d u a l m o l e s o f F F i n i t i a l l y × 100 S e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = m o l e o f s p e c i f i c p r o d u c t s u m o f m o l e o f d e t e c t e d o r g a n i c c o m p o u n d s × 100"
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalytic performances,"3.1 Catalytic performances The performances of gas phase catalytic FF hydrogenation over the Cu/SiO2, Cu/SiO2-x as well as commercial CuCr-Strem catalysts were evaluated under moderate conditions. Changes in FF conversion and FA selectivity with time on stream (TOS) have been plotted as shown in Fig. 1 a and Fig. 1b, respectively. The FA selectivity was higher than 96% over the whole process for all catalysts. The MF was the sole by-product, which was produced by hydrogenolysis of FA [30,31]. The similar high selectivity toward FA during gas phase hydrogenation of FF was also obtained over copper catalyst [32]. The selectivity toward FA increased from 96% up to over 99% and then remained stable as the reaction progressed with reduced MF selectivity. Furthermore, it can be observed from Fig. 1 that the relatively higher FA selectivity was obtained when the FF conversion was relatively lower. The correlation between FF conversion and FA selectivity was also reported previously [8,33,34]. The unmodified granular silica supported copper catalyst (Cu/SiO2) was very poor for the gas phase catalytic hydrogenation of FF. The FF conversion was 84% at 24 h. It decreased sharply to about 40% at 36 h. The similar poor performance was also obtained over fumed silica supported copper catalyst derived from impregnation [21]. Compared to Cu/SiO2, the FF hydrogenation performance improved significantly using the ethanolamine modified granular SiO2 supported copper (Cu/SiO2-x) catalysts. After 36 h on stream, the FF conversion was nearly equal to 100% for the Cu/SiO2-x catalysts. The activity was far higher than that of Cu/SiO2. The stability of Cu/SiO2-x was greatly enhanced compared to Cu/SiO2. The performance was related to the mass ratio (x) between ethanolamine and silica in the initial modification. The time interval from the FF conversion of 99% decrease to 90% was defined as t90, which was used as a measure of the catalyst performance in FF hydrogenation. A larger t90 means the lifetime of the corresponding catalyst was longer. The t90 of the Cu/SiO2-1 catalyst was about 47 h. This illustrated that the performance was improved noticeably upon modification of the granular silica by ethanolamine. The lifetime for Cu/SiO2-1 was inferior to that of commercial CuCr-Strem catalyst, t90 of which was close to 100 h. The stability was further improved when the ethanolamine initial dosage in the granular silica modification was increased. For examples, the t90 was increased to nearly 135 h and 230 h for Cu/SiO2-2 and Cu/SiO2-3, respectively. The performance of these two samples was superior over that of the CuCr-Strem catalyst. When the mass ratio between ethanolamine and silica in the initial pretreatment was increased to 4, the lifetime of the Cu/SiO2-4 catalyst was not much increased over that of Cu/SiO2-3 sample. In consequence, it can be declared that the treatment of silica with ethanolamine would substantially boost the lifetime of the corresponding catalyst prepared by simple impregnation. Moreover, the lifetime of catalyst was extended with the increasing of ethanolamine initial amount that was no more than four times of silica. When the initial usage of ethanolamine for modification exceeded a threshold amount, the performance was barely further changed. The performance of Cu/SiO2-3 was comparable to that of fumed silica supported copper catalyst (Cu/F-SiO2-AE) that was derived from ammonia evaporation developed in our previous study [21]. It should be emphasized that the Cu/SiO2-3 has several advantages compared to the Cu/F-SiO2-AE, particularly, low cost of the granular silica support, and the simple catalyst preparation process. In addition, the spherical Cu/SiO2-3 maintained the same shape as the corresponding support (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, additional molding step was avoided. The copper supported on granular silica catalyst (Cu/SiO2-AE) synthesized by ammonia evaporation was also evaluated under the same conditions. The t90 of Cu/SiO2-AE was about 110 h that was much lower than that of Cu/SiO2-3, which states that the Cu/SiO2-3 exhibited the longer lifetime than that of Cu/SiO2-AE. Based on the above results, the Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst exhibited greatly improved value for industrial application."
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization Several characterizations were performed in order to uncover the difference in the structure of the catalysts. Based on the performance results (Fig. 1), the representative Cu/SiO2, Cu/SiO2-1 as well as Cu/SiO2-3 were characterized and analyzed in detail. The structural parameters were determined by N2 physisorptions (Table 1 ). There were no obvious differences in SBET, Vp and Dp among the samples, which revealed the different performance was not related directly to structural properties. Crystalline structure of calcined samples was measured by XRD (Fig. 3 ). The broad peak at approximately 22° was attributed to amorphous silica [35]. Besides, several diffraction peaks (2θ = 32.4°, 35.4°, 38.7°, 48.6°, 53.4°, 58.2°, 61.5°, 66.2°, 67.9°, 72.3° and 75.0°) were observed in Fig. 3. According to the PDF of 00-048-1548, theses peaks belonged to the feature diffraction of CuO [36]. The intensity of diffraction peaks from CuO was lower for ethanolamine modified granular silica supported copper samples (Cu/SiO2-x) compared to that of unmodified Cu/SiO2. The difference suggested that the dispersion of CuO increased upon the modification of granular silica with ethanolamine. The N content and C content of supports and corresponding catalysts were determined by elemental analysis. The N content and C content was 4.2% and 10.0% for SiO2-1 support. And the N content and C content was 7.1% and 16.6% for SiO2-3 support. The mass ratio of N to C (N/C) was around 0.42 for these two carriers. The data of N/C was smaller than that (0.58) in the ethanolamine molecule. This means that the N species was more likely to decompose than C species during thermal treatment. Furthermore, the N content and C content were far smaller than theoretical value in the initial modification. For example, the N content and C content of SiO2-1 in the initial modification were 14% and 24%, respectively. The above results suggested that the most of the ethanolamine molecules was decomposed during the thermal treatment and N doped carbon covered silica (SiO2-x) was obtained. The content of N doped carbon increased with the increase of ethanolamine usage in the initial modification process. Furthermore, there was no residual N and trace amount of C present in the Cu/SiO2-x samples suggesting that the covered N doped carbon material in the support was fully decomposed during the calcination of the catalyst. The combustion of N doped carbon under static air promoted the segregation of copper oxide species during calcination. Thus the highly dispersed copper was obtained on the silica support. The effect of ethanolamine therefore was to serve as a dispersant (N doped carbon) during the calcination that made CuO highly dispersed on the surface of granular silica. The similar promotion effect was observed for alumina supported cobalt catalyst in the presence of diethylene glycol [37]. And the highly dispersed Ir catalyst was also obtained using an α-alcohol treated silica as carrier [27]. The reduction property of the calcined copper samples was investigated by H2-TPR (Fig. 4 ). Three continuous hydrogen consumption peaks centered at 193℃, 227℃ and 294℃ appeared in the Cu/SiO2 sample. It is reported in the literatures that a higher temperature was needed for the reduction of copper oxide with larger particle size [24,38]. The presence of hydrogen consumption peak with large area at higher temperature (294℃) revealed that dominant large copper oxide particles existed in Cu/SiO2 sample. This phenomenon is consistent with the XRD result (Fig. 3). In addition, the existence of other two small peaks located at relative low temperature suggested that small copper oxide particles also existed in the Cu/SiO2 sample. The observation suggests that the copper oxide with rather wide size distribution in the Cu/SiO2 sample. The peak at about 201℃ with an obvious shoulder peak at about 224℃ was detected in the Cu/SiO2-1. The presence of shoulder peak for Cu/SiO2-1 revealed that particle size was not uniform, some large CuO particles also existed in the sample. The profile of Cu/SiO2-3 exhibited a single hydrogenation consumption peak at about 204−215℃, suggesting the presence of relative small CuO particles with homogeneous size distribution. The reduction degree of copper was roughly calculated by quantification of H2 consumption during H2-TPR. The results are listed in Table 1. The modification of granular silica using ethanolamine improved the reduction of copper oxide. Combined the results of XRD (Fig. 3) and H2-TPR (Fig. 4), it can be concluded that the modification of granular silica with ethanolamine could improve the copper dispersion as well as reduction degree of copper oxide and the promotion effect related to the dosage of ethanolamine in the initial modification process. TEM images (Fig. 5 ) of reduced samples verified the indication from H2-TPR (Fig. 4) results. The average particle size of copper in Cu/SiO2 sample was relatively large (17.8 nm) and the particle size distribution was rather broad. The small amount of ethanolamine modified granular silica derived copper catalyst (Cu/SiO2-1) contained mainly fine particles with some large particles. The particle size distribution was also not uniform but shifted to a narrow range in smaller particles. The average particle size was approximately 9 nm. The small particles (average particle size was about 5.3 nm) with homogenous distribution was observed for reduced Cu/SiO2-3 sample. The observation revealed that reduced Cu/SiO2-3 has evidently most abundant highly dispersed metallic copper particles. The XRD patterns of freshly reduced catalysts that were derived from the reduction of calcined catalysts in-situ under H2 in the Anton Paar XRK 900 chamber are depicted in Fig. 6 . The diffraction peak resulted from amorphous silica was also detected. Three peaks at 43.2°, 50.3° and 73.9° that were attributed to metallic Cu were seen [39,40]. The diffraction peaks from CuO were not observed in the freshly reduced samples. The absence of CuO peaks demonstrated that CuO was completely reduced to Cu2O or metallic Cu. The near ambient pressure in-situ XPS test (Fig. 7 ) was carried out for freshly reduced samples to inspect the surface composition. The in-situ spectra of Cu 2p and Cu LMM XAES are displayed in Fig. 7A and B, respectively. The peaks centered at around 933.1 eV and 952.5 eV assigning to the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 were observed in Fig. 7A. These peaks were attributed to the Cu+ or Cu° species [41,42]. In addition, characteristic satellite peaks at approximately 945−950 eV from Cu2+ species did not appear, demonstrating the absence of CuO [43]. The existence of Cu+ and Cu° as well as the absence of Cu2+ indicated the complete reduction of CuO. The result was in line with the XRD analysis (Fig. 6). Since the Cu 2p binding energy of Cu+ and Cu° are almost identical, the Cu LMM XAES (Fig. 7B) was applied to distinguish them [44]. Two overlapping Auger kinetic energy peaks were divided into two symmetrical peaks, located at 912.6–913.9 eV and 916.2–917.9 eV that were assigned to Cu+ and Cu°, respectively [40]. The modified Auger parameter, which was equal to the sum of the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 and the kinetic energy of Cu LMM Auger electron, was also commonly used to quantify the Cu+ (∼1847 eV) and Cu° (∼1851 eV) [45]. As listed in Table 2 , the auger parameter of the copper samples pointed to the coexistence of Cu° and Cu+. The molar ratio of Cu+/(Cu° + Cu+) was almost identical for all samples. The exposed metallic copper sites were quantified by N2O titration (Table 1). The metallic copper particle size derived from the N2O titration decreased with the modification of ethanolamine, which agreed well with data from TEM (Fig. 5). The surface area of metallic copper was 6.4 m2/g, 15.8 m2/g and 22.4 m2/g for Cu/SiO2, Cu/SiO2-1 and Cu/SiO2-3, respectively. Thus, the modification of granular silica promoted the dispersing of copper oxide, and then enhanced the dispersion of metallic copper. The Cu/SiO2-3 contained maximum exposed metallic copper sites. While the exposed metallic copper site in Cu/SiO2 was the lowest. Because of the Cu+ content was almost the same among the studied samples, the Cu+ sites also increased followed the sequence of Cu/SiO2, Cu/SiO2-1 then Cu/SiO2-3."
9,Discussion,"3.3 Discussion The characterization results of XRD (Figs. 3 and 6), H2-TPR (Fig. 4) and TEM (Fig. 5) illustrated that modification of granular silica support using ethanolamine promoted the dispersing of copper species, both oxide and metal. The uniformly distributed copper with small particle size was obtained using appropriate amount of ethanolamine modified granular silica as carrier. The higher copper oxide dispersion led to higher metallic copper surface area (Table 1). The Cu+ and Cu0 coexisted in the surface of support (Fig. 7, Table 2). And the similar Cu+ was also observed for different catalysts. Thus, the highest exposed metallic copper sites as well as the largest amount of surface Cu+ sites was obtained for Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst. The metallic copper and Cu+ are considered as the active site for FF hydrogenation [46]. Thus, the Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst exhibited excellent performance compared to the unmodified Cu/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the shape of ethanolamine modified granular silica supported copper catalyst synthesized by simple impregnation was well maintained (Fig. 2). Thus, the molding step was not needed for the catalyst application. Furthermore, the performance of Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst was also superior to that of commercial CuCr-Strem catalyst and ammonia evaporation derived granular silica supported copper catalyst (Cu/SiO2-AE). The textual properties and copper surface area of Cu/SiO2-4 were similar to that of Cu/SiO2-3, which resulted in the similar catalytic performances (Fig. 1). Therefore, the Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst prepared by simple impregnation using moderate amount of ethanolamine modified granular silica as support exhibited greatly improved value for industrial application."
10,Deactivation analysis,"3.4 Deactivation analysis As shown in Fig. 1, although the stability of Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst was considerably improved over the conventional Cu/SiO2 and commercial CuCr-Strem catalysts, the FF conversion still decreased slowly along the whole reaction process. The observation means that supported copper catalyst on ethanolamine modified granular silica deactivated at a very slow rate during FF hydrogenation. Thus, the deactivation mechanism was also analyzed. Metal sintering, carbon deposition as well as Cu species evolution may lead to the deactivation of copper catalysts as reported in the literatures [47–49]. The spent Cu/SiO2-3 sample after being employed in FF hydrogenation for 340 h was characterized and analyzed. From the TEM images (Fig. 8 ) of the reduced and the spent samples, it can be seen that the average copper particle size increased slightly to 7.7 nm from 5.3 nm after reaction, which suggested that the slight sintering occurred during the hydrogenation reaction. The sintering of copper particles resulted in partly decreased FF conversion. In addition, the TG measurement and elemental analysis were applied for the spent Cu/SiO2-3 sample. The carbon content was about 28.7 wt% as determined by elemental analysis (Table 1). The obvious weight loss (larger than 40 wt%) of spent Cu/SiO2-3 sample was also detected by TG (Fig. 9 ). The weight loss mainly ranged from 200 ℃ to 500 ℃. This kind of weight loss during TG under air was attributed to carbon oxidation [50]. The weight loss determined by TG was higher than carbon content measured by elemental analysis suggesting the existence of oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the spent sample, which confirmed that the deposited carbon species was generated by the polymerization of FF and FA [22,51]. Thus, evident carbon deposition was formed in spent catalyst and then some of the active sites were covered by deposited carbon, which would lead to the decreasing of FF conversion. Therefore, the deactivation of the catalyst may be attributed to the combined action of copper sintering and carbon deposition."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a highly efficient granular silica supported copper catalyst was developed for FF hydrogenation to FA in gas phase. The catalyst was prepared by simple impregnation using ethanolamine modified granular silica as support. The dispersion of copper increased with increasing ethanolamine usage in the initial modification. Highly dispersed copper with uniform particle size distribution was obtained for appropriate amount of ethanolamine modified granular silica supported copper sample (Cu/SiO2-3). The Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst contained maximum amount of exposed metallic copper sites and largest amount of Cu+ sites. The FA production performance was improved by using the ethanolamine modified granular silica as carrier. The Cu/SiO2-3 catalyst exhibited the best performance thanks to its maximum active sites. The slow deactivation resulted from the carbon deposition and slight copper sintering was observed."
