0,Introduction,"Municipal effluents, industrial swage and agricultural wastewater are the most important source of pollution in surface waters. This wastewater often contains chemical materials used in households, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum, detergents, heavy metals, etc. (Vincze et al., 2015). Since the compositions of sewage are very diverse and complex, it is difficult to estimate the effect of any chemical materials on the environment. However, the toxicity of some of specific compounds present in swage and outlet of wastewater treatment plant has been investigated (Nassiri Koopaei and Abdollahi, 2017). The production of ethanol from sugarcane molasses or sugar beet molasses generates a huge amount of wastewater, which can pose a serious threat to the aquatic environment (Satyawali and Balakrishnan, 2008). In this industry, to maintain the optimum performance of the alcohol producing yeasts, a high volume of water is required, which ultimately becomes wastewater. Therefore, the industrial unit producing alcohol is one of the most polluting industries in the world. Under normal circumstances, 10–15 L of wastewater are generated by 1 L of alcohol produced (Pazokei et al., 2006). The chemical oxygen demand (COD: 80,000–100000 mg L−1), biological oxygen demand (BOD: 40,000–50000 mg L−1), acidic pH, unpleasant smell and dark brown color are the essential characteristics of the swage of ethanol-producing plants (Satyawali and Balakrishnan, 2008; Xin et al., 2017). A significant part of this wastewater includes organic matter such as nitrogen (1660–4200 mg L−1), phosphorus (225–3038 mg L−1) and potassium (9600–17475 mg L−1), which can cause eutrophication of surface waters, increase water turbidity and disrupt the equilibrium in aquatic ecosystems (Satyawali and Balakrishnan, 2008). Pazokei et al. (2006) found that the discharge of each liter of effluent from these industrial units can lead to the contamination of 150–200 L of clean water. More than fifteen active industrial units in the field of production of medical and industrial alcohol (ethanol) from molasses are present in various provinces of Iran, including Lorestan, which often discharge their wastewater into the environment (Pazokei et al., 2006; Taghizadeh, 2011). Due to the fact that the cost of cleaning the wastewater effluent from the alcohol production industry is relatively high in developing countries, its implementation is scarce and the efficiency of the wastewater treatment system in these factories is also very low. Furthermore, conventional wastewater treatment processes are inappropriate due to the high concentrations of organic compounds, as solvent or colloid waste, in the sewage effluent of ethanol production units (Taghizadeh, 2011). One of the methods to monitor the ecotoxicological effects of polluting compounds in an aquatic ecosystem is the evaluation of the toxicity of these substances to the living organisms as a bio-indicator (Vincze et al., 2015; Fiorino et al., 2018; Dale et al., 2019; Miao et al., 2020). Once in the body, pollutants are mostly subjected to an intense hepatic metabolism to increase its water solubility and promote its elimination. Phase I enzymes such as carboxylesterases and members of the cytochrome P450 family and phase II enzymes such as glutathione s-transferase participate in this process (Aliko et al., 2018; Lammel et al., 2019). However, some of the xenobiotics in the sewage have genotoxic potential and can induce DNA damage and genetic mutations (Hariri et al., 2018; Jovanović et al., 2018). The metabolism and detoxification of many chemical compounds present in urban and industrial wastewaters (Giang et al., 2017) can also increase the production the reactive chemical species (ROS), which results in oxidative stress and cellular damage (Sakalli et al., 2018; Dale et al., 2019). To cope with these ROS, organism organisms have an elaborate antioxidant system that includes enzymes such as catalase or superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Banaee et al., 2013; Tur et al., 2018; Natalotto et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2017; Dale et al., 2019). In addition, the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceutical and cosmetic materials in wastewater can affect the sexual and behavioral physiology of aquatic animals (Pohl et al., 2018). Alterations in biochemical indicators (Banaee et al., 2016), oxidative stress damage (Karadag et al., 2014), and immunosuppression (Mahmoud et al., 2016) have been observed in fishes exposed to industrial and urban wastewater. Fish are one of the most sensitive animals to environmental changes (Fazio et al., 2014; Banaee et al., 2015a; Dale et al., 2019; de Andrade Brito et al., 2018). Consequently, the physiological and behavioral response of fishes can be considered as a bioassay for monitoring and assessing the risk of sewage discharge to surface waters (Karadag et al., 2014; Banaee et al., 2015b; Aguilar-Betancourt et al., 2016; Banaee et al., 2016; Topić Popović et al., 2019). Furthermore, the exposure of fish to pollutants can also be advantageous in assessing the environmental toxicity risk compared to routine physical and chemical tests to evaluate water quality (Aguirre-Martínez et al., 2017; Bartoskova et al., 2013; Rezaei Shadegan and Banaee, 2018; Sehonova et al., 2017). Additionally, the use of aquatic organisms as biosensors can provide accurate information from pollutant toxicity to researchers in a controlled environment (Karadag et al., 2014; Banaee et al., 2019c; Capillo et al., 2018). The drainage of the Nasr Ethyl Alcohol Company (Khorram-Abad City, Lorestan Province) into Khorram-Abad River (33°27′50″N 48°19′18″E) can disturb the aquatic life in this ecosystem. Thus, the purpose of the present survey was to assess the impact of sewage of the Nasr Alcohol producing unit on fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was selected as bioindicator since this species is considered adequate for environmental, toxicological studies due to its high adaptability to laboratory conditions, rapid growth, short bio-cycle, embryonic transparency, complete identification of genetic map and physiological characteristics. We hypothesize that exposure of fish to sub-lethal concentrations of wastewater effluent from Nasr alcohol production plant in Lorestan can cause biochemical changes, oxidative stress and induce genotoxicity in target tissues."
1,Methods and materials,
2,Fish,"2.1 Fish Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio) of both sexes, were acquired from a local farm (Shiraz, Iran) and were kept in a plastic tank supplied with dechlorinated, aerated tap water at 26 ± 2 °C with 14: 10 h light/dark cycle. Water quality was monitored daily considering unionized ammonia (<0.05 mg L−1), dissolved oxygen (6.5 ± 0.5 mg L−1), temperature (at 26 ± 2 °C) and pH (7.4 ± 0.2). Fish were acclimatized for two weeks before exposure to sewage and during this period fish health was monitored both by morphological and pathological examinations. Fish were fed twice daily with a formulated diet obtained from Beyza Feed Mill (Shiraz, Iran) and the excess food and feces were daily removed from the tanks. Feeding was stopped two days before the commencing of the experiment to keep the experimental animals under the same metabolic conditions."
3,Waste water,"2.2 Waste water The final wastewater effluent of Nasr Ethyl Alcohol Company was collected before it was drained into Khorram-Abad River, and carried to the Laboratory of Environmental Sciences and Pollution Control of Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology, Iran. Physical and chemical characteristics of the sewage effluents of the alcoholic production unit are submitted in Tables 1 and 2 . The raw wastewater effluent was collected every week and stored in a dark container at 4 °C until use. Because mortality was observed in fish exposed to 5% ≤ sewage, in this study, fish were exposed to 2% ≥ wastewater. The effluent was diluted with moderately hard water to obtain treatments of half, one and two percent of wastewater."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design The study was were appraised and confirmed by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Behbahan Khatam Alanbia University of Technology, Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources (486399.10.1- January 2018). One-hundred and eighty zebrafish were divided into four groups and stocked into twelve trial tank (80 L) which filled with 70 L dechlorinated water and exposed to sewage for 21 days under static-renewal conditions. Each treatment was replicated three times, and each tank contained 15 fish. Group I was maintained in tap water to serve as a control. Group II, III and IV were exposed to 0.5, 1 and 2% of sewage, respectively. Water (50%) from each tank was exchanged and replaced daily with fresh water and the appropriate volume of wastewater to maintain the nominal concentrations. After the end the trial period, 24 fish per treatment were sampled and weighed. After weighing, fish were benumbed with carnation powder solution (200 mg L−1). The fish were not fed for 24 h before sampling and dissection. The fish were autopsied to acquire the liver. For enzymatic and biochemical analyses, liver samples were homogenized on ice in cold buffer of 100 mM potassium phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with a pH of 7.0 comprising 2 mM of EDTA (Riedel-Haën, Germany). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatants collected and frozen at −25 °C until further analysis."
5,Biochemical parameters analysis,"2.4 Biochemical parameters analysis The activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were determined in liver homogenates following the methods developed by Moss and Henderson (1999). The total antioxidant capacity was assessed based on the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) following the technique designated by Benzie and Strain, (1996) using TPTZ (2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine) as a substrate. A Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was evaluated by the modified thiobarbituric acid assay (Placer et al., 1996). Catalase (CAT) activity was determined following the protocol presented by Góth, (1991) using H2O2 as a substrate. All biochemical indicator were measured in UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Biochrom Libra S22) and results normalized by protein levels assigned by routine techniques of Johnson et al. (1999). Total RNA isolation and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). A portion of zebrafish liver was dissected, immersed in Trizol Reagent (RiboEx, South Korea), and stored at −80 °C until they were used. The total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of homogenized liver tissue with Trizol Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA samples were treated with RNase-free water with DEPC (Thermo Scientific, USA). Contaminations with genomic DNA were avoided by treatment of 5 μg total RNA with DNase I (Thermo Scientific, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C. The quality of total RNA were evaluated using electrophoresis (Biorad, Minigel) on agarose gels (1%) stained with Loading dye (Thermo Scientific, USA). The quantification and purity of the RNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000; USA) at 230, 260, and 280 nm wavelengths. The cDNA was obtained using an oligo-dT primer and reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The qRT-PCR analysis was carried out on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system. The amplifications were conducted in a total volume of 25 μl, including ten μl of SYBR Green Master Mix reagents (2 × ), two μl of cDNA and 0.8 μl of one by one primer (10 μM), ROX dye (0.4 μL) and 11 μl DEPC H2O. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 94 °C for 5 min (for enzyme activation), and after that 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C (for denaturation), 30 s at 60 °C (for annealing), and 30 s at 72 °C (for the extension). An extra temperature-ramping phase from 95 °C to 65 °C was set for the melting curve. All reactions were conducted in triplicate with negative controls without a sample (replaced by 1 μl of ddH2O). The gene-expression levels were analyzed by normalizing to the standards of β-actin in the same sample. These primers were presented in Table 3 . Relative gene expression was calculated using the comparative CT (2^−ΔCT) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001)."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate the hypothesis of homogeneity and normality of the data. Abnormal data was modified in the proper way where necessary. The analysis of statistical data was carried out by one-way ANOVA, and comparisons of means were made by the Tukey HSD to detect significant differences (P < 0.01). The statistical analysis was carried out at the significance level of 1%, using Graph Pad Prism 8.0.2. Data are illustrated as mean ± SEM."
7,Results and discussion,"The present work was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effect of the effluent from the Nasr Ethyl Alcohol Company (Khorramabad, Iran) on the zebrafish (Danio rerio), (see in Figs. 1-6). No mortality was observed in fish during the semi-static experiments. The expression of carboxylesterase 2 (Ces2) and cytochrome P450 A (Cyp1a) genes increased after 21 days exposure to one and two percent of wastewater from the Ethyl Alcohol Company when compared with the control groups (P < 0.01), (Fig. 1 ). Consequently, the increased expression of Ces2 and Cyp1a genes after exposure to sewage may indicate the presence of chemical compounds that induce the detoxification response. Cytochromes P450 A play essential roles in the detoxification of the xenobiotics. In accordance, Lara-Jacobo et al. (2019) found that the expression of cytochrome P450 1A increased in embryos of Western clawed frog (Silurana tropicalis) exposed to diluted bitumen (dilbit) mixture. The authors suggested that increased P450 1A mRNA levels indicate the activation of the phase I detoxification system (Lara-Jacobo et al., 2019). A significant increase in the expression of Cyp1a and Cyp3a gene was observed in the liver of rainbow trout exposed to swage effluents (Cuklev et al., 2012). In addition, an increase in the transcription of Cyp1a was found in the liver of D. rerio (Aguirre-Martínez et al., 2017), and the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) mRNA 1 family genes in the gills of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus exposed to a pharmaceutical mixtures (Beijer et al., 2013). Geier et al. (2018) revealed that Cyp1a gene expression might be increased in various tissues of zebrafish exposed to some kinds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Geier et al., 2018). An increase in Cypa1A mRNA expression was reported in primary hepatocytes isolated from Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua exposed to ss-naphthoflavone (BNF), 1,2,3,7,8-polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and cadmium (Cd) (Søfteland et al., 2010) and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, H. nobilis, and Ictiobus cyprinellus exposed to rotenone (Amberg et al., 2012), and from Danio rerio exposed to 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicide (2,4-D) (Gaaied et al., 2019). A significant increase in Cyp1a gene expression was also observed in the gills of Cyprinus carpio after exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) (Agus et al., 2015). Carboxylesterases are a group of esterases that play an essential role in the hydrolysis of chemical compounds containing esters, thioesters, amides, and carbamates. However, esterases, after oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), are the third most important group of enzymes activated in xenobiotic detoxification (Alves et al., 2015). Furthermore, Soto-Mancera and Albendín (2020) found that the activity of carboxylesterase is essential for the maintenance of acetylcholinesterase activity. Glutathione S-transferase P-1 (Gstp-1a) gene expression was significantly elevated after two percent of sewage exposure (P < 0.01), (Fig. 2 ). Hence, the overexpression Gstp-1a gene may be a normal response to facilitate the elimination of toxic metabolites from the hepatocytes of fish exposed to sewage. A significant increase in the activity of GST was detected in the gills of P. lineatus exposed to wastewater effluent (Pérez et al., 2018). Similar result was reported in P. lineatus exposed to wastewater effluents (Cazenave et al., 2009) and sewage of agriculture fields (Vieira et al., 2016). Likewise, the Gst mRNA expression was significantly increased in the liver of O. kisutch after exposure to cadmium (Espinoza et al., 2012). The mRNA expression of Gstp-1a was increased in the hepatocytes of C. carpio exposed to tributyltin (Li et al., 2015) and D. rerio exposed to 2,4-D (Gaaied et al., 2019). Amberg et al. (2012) found that the expression of gst gene was increased in silver carp exposed to rotenone (Amberg et al., 2012). In the current experiment, gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Sod1), catalase (Cat), Glutathione reductase (Gsr) was significantly increased in the hepatocytes after 21 days of two percent of sewage exposure (P < 0.01), (Fig. 3 ). Increasing the expression of the Sod1 gene may be a normal response to increased levels of superoxide anions. Pérez et al. (2018) revealed that the activity of SOD increased in the gills of P. lineatus after encountering with wastewater effluent (Pérez et al., 2018). In C. carpio, treatment with di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) elevated Sod1 mRNA levels (Agus et al., 2015) and in Hypophthalmichthys molitrix exposed to rotenone (Amberg et al., 2012). Changes in Cat gene expression may reflect increased levels of hydrogen peroxide in fish liver cells exposed to sewage. Exposure to sewage effluents from treatment plants caused increased CAT activity in the liver of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Almroth et al., 2008). The mRNA levels of Cat gene were increased in silver carp after a 6-h exposure to rotenone (Amberg et al., 2012). The mRNA levels of Cat were also increased in the hepatocytes of D. rerio exposed to 0.2 and 0.05 mg L−1 2,4-D (Gaaied et al., 2019). Overexpression of Gsr gene in the liver of zebrafish exposed to sewage may help to scavenge ROS. Cazenave et al. (2009) showed that the activity of hepatic GR was significantly increased in liver of P. lineatus inhabiting in sewage-contaminated waters. An increase in the Gsr gene expression was observed in the C. Carpio after exposure to tributyltin (Li et al., 2015), and D. rerio exposed to 2,4-D (Gaaied et al., 2019). Results showed that Gpx1a gene expression significantly increased in hepatocytes of fish exposed to the one and two percent of sewage (P < 0.01), (Fig. 3). As a result, increased GPx expression may be a mechanism of cellular defense to neutralize of ROS and avoid lipid peroxidation and in hepatocyte of fish exposed to sewage. Similar finding were seen in the hepatocytes of C. carpio subjected to tributyltin (Li et al., 2015) and H. molitrix treated with rotenone (Amberg et al., 2012), and D. rerio exposed to 2,4-D (Gaaied et al., 2019). Agus et al. (2015) found that DBP exposure caused a significant increase in the Gpx gene expression in the gills of C. carpio ( Agus et al. 2015 ). Exposure to all concentrations of sewage significantly increased metallothionein 1 (Mt1) gene expression the hepatocytes of zebrafish as compared to reference groups (P < 0.01), whereas the expression of Mt2 was only increased after fish exposure to two percent of sewage (P < 0.01), (Fig. 4 ). Consequently, the increased expression of Mt1 and Mt2 in the liver of zebrafish can point of the presence of heavy metals in the wastewater effluent of Nasr Ethyl Alcohol Company. Our results are in accordance with previous findings that reported increased expression of Mt in liver of Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) (Espinoza et al., 2012) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) (Søfteland et al., 2010) exposed to cadmium. Researchers found that there are differences in the biochemical structure and function of metallothionein 1 and 2 in cells. MT-1 is often involved in the detoxification of metal ions, while MT-2 is included in the homeostasis of copper ions. Furthermore, MT-2 gene expression levels are tens of times higher than MT-1 gene expression levels (Wang et al., 2011; Dong et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018). Discharge of alcohol production plants can increase the concentration of sulfate (SO4 2−), bicarbonate (HCO3 −), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and Iron (Fe+2 and Fe+3) in water (Table 1). An enhanced ion concentration can damage the cell membranes through osmotic stress (Kleinhenz et al., 2019). Moreover, disturbance in the function of ion channels may imbalance the intracellular ion homeostasis. It negatively affects the activity of many enzymes. A higher iron level in fish can lead to cytotoxicity (Singh et al., 2019). An increase in iron may initiate a Fenton reaction and therefore cause free radicals and oxidative damages to cells (Singh et al., 2019). Sulphur compounds in sewage can disturb the function of mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase and thus prevent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (Sreejai and Jaya, 2010). Acetaldehyde is a highly toxic compound found in the sewage of an alcohol making unit (Table 2). In fact, acetaldehyde and aldehyde products present in the effluent can lead to lipid peroxidation through increased ROS production rates (Lu et al., 2018). Acetaldehyde has a carcinogenic potential and can interfere with DNA replication (Lu et al., 2018). The total antioxidant capacity measured with the FRAP assay in fish following exposure to one and two percent of sewage were significantly higher than the group used as a control (P < 0.01), (Fig. 5 ). This increase reflects the antioxidant adaptation to deal with the rise of ROS induced by the wastewater exposure. However, this increase in the antioxidant capability was not enough to avoid lipid peroxidation, since the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased in the liver of fish exposed to all concentrations of effluent (Fig. 5). Similarly, Pérez et al. (2018) showed that exposure to wastewater effluent caused higher MDA levels in the liver of P. lineatus. The increased MDA levels in hepatocytes evidenced an imbalance between the antioxidant capacity and ROS levels, leading to oxidative stress and increased lipid peroxidation. Oxidative damage was observed in the different tissues of Prochilodus lineatus after exposure to untreated sewage effluents (Cazenave et al., 2014; Vieira et al., 2016). Increased rate of lipid peroxidation in the liver of Channa punctatus exposed to sewage was previously reported (Javed et al. 2016a, 2016b). There was a significant increase in the activity of CAT in the hepatocyte of fish after exposure to wastewater effluent of Nasr Ethyl Alcohol unit for 21 days (Fig. 5) Increased catalase activity in the hepatocytes may have been a physiological response to increased hydrogen peroxide during the metabolism of xenobiotics present in the effluent. Increased CAT activity indicated oxidative stress. Exposure of leaf frog Phyllomedusa iheringii to sewage also increased CAT, SOD, and GST activities (Santos et al., 2015). Li et al. (2017) observed changes of CAT activity in the liver tissue of frogs (Rana chensinensis) after trichlorfon exposure. Gomes et al. (2019) studied the direct effect of carbamazepine and clonazepam on oxidative biomarkers in the liver of Danio rerio and reported increased MDA, and GSH levels and CAT activity. Sreejai and Jaya (2010) suggested that fish exposure to sulphur compounds increases CAT and MDA activity. The activity of ALT in hepatocytes of fish exposed to 2% sewage of the Nasr alcohol producing unit was significantly higher than that of the standard, whereas AST activity was increased after exposure to one and two percent of sewage (P < 0.01), (Fig. 6 ). One of the important non-enzymatic antioxidants is GSH, which consists of amino acids glutamate, cysteine and glycine. Since the AST and ALT enzymes contribute in glutamate biosynthesis from α-ketoglutarate (Ellinger et al., 2011), the increased activities of AST and ALT may contribute to the maintenance of the cellular antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, AST and ALT play a primary role in the metabolism of amino-acids and gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes (Banaee et al., 2019c). Therefore, increasing the activity of AST and ALT in hepatocytes of fish exposed to sewage may indicate an increase in the rate of cell metabolism under stressful conditions. Same findings were reported in C. carpio captured from contaminated areas in the Ataturk Dam Lake (Fırat and Alıcı, 2012; Güngördü and Ozmen, 2012). A significant increase was also observed in the activity of AST in liver of P. lineatus exposed to wastewater effluent (Pérez et al., 2018). The increased activity of AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH may also be due to the increased lipid peroxidation rate of the hepatocellular membrane. Lu et al. (2018) found that elevated AST, ALT, and ALP activity in the serum of acetaldehyde-treated mice were related to acetaldehyde hepatotoxicity (Lu et al., 2018). Fish exposed to one and two percent of sewage from alcohol producing unit showed a significant increase in LDH activity compared to the reference group (P < 0.01), (Fig. 6). An increase in the LDH activity is also a biomarker of cell necrosis caused by cytotoxicity (Parhamifar et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013). Therefore, the increased LDH activity found in the hepatocytes may derive from the combination of hypoxic conditions and oxidative damage to the cells associated to the pollutants present in the wastewater. Moreover, lactic acid is one of the most abundant compounds in wastewater. Therefore, lactic acid metabolism in the liver may account for the increased LDH activity. Banaee and Taheri (2019) found that the activity of LDH increased in the freshwater snail, Galba truncatula exposed to municipal sewage (Banaee and Taheri, 2019). Exposure to sewage caused a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in GGT activity in fish hepatocytes (Fig. 6). Since GGT has a crucial role in the λ-glutamyl cycle and glutathione homeostasis (Hanigan, 2014; Koenig and Seneff, 2015; Banaee et al., 2019a), a decreased activity in fish exposed to the sewage of alcohol producing unit may show interference in cellular glutathione homeostasis. Thus, reduced GGT activity may be a biomarker of oxidative stress in fish exposed to the effluent of an alcohol producing unit. Furthermore, GGT plays a significant role in the assimilation of amino acids; consequently, a reduction in its activity can interrupt the absorption of amino acids (Banaee et al., 2019b). Some results were observed in C. carpio exposed to micro-plastic particles and paraquat (Nematdoost Haghi and Banaee, 2017), and chlorpyrifos and polyethylene glycol (Hatami et al., 2019). The results displayed that ALP activity in fish liver cells was significantly increased when exposed to one and two percent of sewage compared to the reference group (P < 0.01), (Fig. 6). Increased ALP activity in the hepatocytes may be due to an increase in the rate of transphosphorylation to provide energy to counteract the effects of xenobiotics. Ullah et al. (2019) observed that deltamethrin led to a rise in the ALP activity in the silver carp (Ullah et al., 2019)."
8,Conclusion,"Our results showed that exposure to the wastewater from the Nasr Ethyl Alcohol Unit caused significant increases in the expression of antioxidant and detoxification-related genes in the liver of zebrafish indicating the presence of highly toxic xenobiotics in the sewage. The cytotoxicity and changes in biochemical parameters in the hepatocytes of fish can also be attributed to these pollutants in the wastewater of the alcohol industry. Therefore, the continuity in the drainage of the Nasr alcoholization unit to the Khorram-rood River could jeopardize the health of aquatic animals. Therefore, it would be advisable to legally prevent untreated wastewater from being discharged into the river. Additional studies to determine the specific contaminants present in wastewater would be necessary to better understand the possible toxic effects on the exposed fauna."
