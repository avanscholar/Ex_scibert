0,Introduction,"As a sustainable method of green energy conversion, photocatalytic hydrogen production has drawn great attention ever since the report on the solar water splitting of TiO2 at 1972 [1]. Among the visible light-responsive photocatalysts, CdS and ZnCdS alloy have attracted extensive research interests because of the narrow band gap, appropriate band position and high light absorption coefficient [2–7]. Various nanostructures of CdS including quantum dots (0D), nanowires (1D), nanosheets (2D) and nanoparticles (3D) have been constructed for solar water splitting, among which 1D and 2D structures exhibit excellent photocatalytic property thanks to the fast charge transfer and less carrier recombination [8–17]. Especially, sheet-like structure can not only provide a good platform for the growth of co-catalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction, but also make the hetero-interface more controllable for charge separation. Compared to the severe photo-corrosion of CdS, ZnCdS alloy shows relative higher photo stability and more tunable energy band gap [18]. Although ZnCdS QDs have been widely prepared for high efficient hydrogen evolution, they tend to aggregate with each other to decrease the surface energy. Such disordered aggregation will generate a lot of grain boundaries and surface defects, which acts as recombination centers for photo-excited carriers, thus highly limits the photocatalytic property. Considering the advantages of 2D structure, ZnCdS nanosheets should be highly expected for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, such a structure has been rarely reported yet. On the other hand, carbon based materials such as rGO [19], CNT [20], C-dots [21,22] and onion-like carbon (OLC) [23] play great role in photocatalytic application. The sp2 hybridization and surface functional groups are two characteristics of the carbon materials. When composited with semiconductor photocatalysts such as ZnCdS [24–28], C3N4 [29–32], TiO2 [33–36] and BiVO4 [37], the high electron conductivity originated from the sp2 hybridization allows them to act as effective reservoir and transporter for photoelectrons, while the surface functional groups bring emissive energy traps on the surface, leading to the wavelength-dependent luminescence emission and obvious optical absorption in visible-light region, thus greatly enhance the photocatalytic property. For example, CDots in CDots-C3N4 have unique photo-induced electron transfer, photo-luminescence and electron reservoir properties [30]; the OLC in OLC-ZnCdS has a larger size than C dots, which makes OLC to be a better substrate for supporting photocatalysts and enhances the H2 generation rate to about threefold of pure Cd0.5Zn0.5S [27]. Taken the advantages of ZnCdS 2D structure into consideration, the hybridization of ZnCdS nanosheets with OLC or C dots will be of great potential for efficient PC property. Herein, hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets with size of 145–211 nm and thickness of 24.8–29.1 nm were synthesized by a simple thermal solution method. The photocatalytic H2 generation rate of the nanosheets greatly surpasses the QDs counterpart. A core-sheath structure of ZnCdS-OLC was further formed by decorating the nanosheets with OLC, and a two-fold enhancement of the H2 generation rate (10.8 mmol/g/h) was obtained. As the effect of the morphology and hybridization on the optical, catalytic and electrochemical impedance property was systematically studied, the energy diagram and charge separation/transfer mechanism was revealed for the enhanced photocatalytic property."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials All chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade and used without further purification. Cadmium chloride (CdCl2·2.5H2O, ≥99%, Analytical reagent, Sinopharm), zinc chloride (ZnCl2, ≥98%, Analytical reagent, Sinopharm), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, ≥98%, Analytical reagent, Maclin), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥96%, Analytical reagent, Sinopharm), polyvinyl alcohol ([C2H4O]n, ≥99%, Sinopharm), sodium sulfite anhydrous (Na2SO3, ≥98%, Analytical reagent, Sinopharm) were used as received. Solutions were prepared using high purity water (Milli-Q purification system, resistivity >18 MΩ·cm)."
3,Synthesis of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets,"2.2 Synthesis of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets Firstly, 25 mL NaOH (15 mmol) aqueous solution was added into 20 mL ethylene glycol solution containing 2 mmol ZnCl2 and 2 mmol CdCl2·2.5H2O. After the mixed solution was stirred continuously and heated to 160 °C under the protection of nitrogen, 20 mL ethylene glycol solution dissolving 4 mmol Na2S was added. Then it was heated at 180 °C for 1 h for the growth of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets. After growth, the nanosheets were collected by centrifugation, washed by alcohol and deionized water respectively for three times, and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 12 h."
4,Synthesis of OLC-Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets,"2.3 Synthesis of OLC-Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets To prepare OLC, 25 mL aqueous solution containing 0.6 g sodium hydroxide and 0.6 g polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Mw: 1750) was transferred to a Teflon autoclave and heated at 250 °C for 10 h. After cooled down to room temperature naturally, large particles were filtered away from the obtained solution and the left product was dissolved in ethanol, which shows transparent light yellow color (Fig. S1). The synthesis of OLC-Zn0.5Cd0.5S composites was similar with that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets except the addition of OLC solution before the growth of CdZnS. The weight percentage (wt%) of OLC in the composite was tuned from 3% to 6% by changing the addition of OLC solution from 16 mL to 28 mL."

After growth for 1 h, the QDs were collected by centrifugation, washed by alcohol and deionized water respectively for three times, and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 12 h."
6,"Structure, compositional and optical characterizations","2.5 Structure, compositional and optical characterizations The morphology, microstructure and composition were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7100F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai 20) equipped with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å). The absorption property was studied by an UV–Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere device (UV-3600, Shimadzu)."
7,Electrochemical characterizations,"2.6 Electrochemical characterizations Mott-schottky measurements were performed in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 6.8) with a three-electrode electrochemical work station (CHI 760E, CH instrument). Pt foil and saturated Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. To make working electrode, 2 mg sample powder and 1 mg polyethylene glycol (M = 20,000) were mixed in 1 mL ethanol to form a paste, then it was spread over 1 cm2 square of FTO substrate and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The potential was converted to the potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by equation of E ( ν s RHE) = E ( ν s Ag/AgCl) + EAg/AgCl (ref) + 0.0591 V × pH, where (EAg/AgCl (ref) = 0.1976 V ν s NHE (Normal Hydrogen Electrode) at 25 °C) [38]."
8,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"2.7 Photocatalytic H2 evolution 30 mg sample powder was dispersed in 100 mL aqueous solution of 0.75 M Na2S and 1.05 M Na2SO3. After degassing for 30 min by nitrogen, the photocatalytic experiment was performed under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Perfect Light) with a cut-off filter of 420 nm and an incident power of 300 mW/cm2. The catalytic solution was kept continually stirring during the whole experiment. In every hour, 1 mL gas production was collected and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-2018, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD). Further cycling stability experiment was performed under the same condition. The calculation formula of AQE is as follows [39] : AQE ( % ) = number o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s number o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 % a 2 + b 2 = 2 × n u m b e r o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s number o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 %"
9,Results and discussion,"The Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets were prepared by a two-step solvothermal method. Firstly, Zn2+ and Cd2+ precursors were heated in ethylene glycol solution to form hydroxide intermediates, then sulfurization process was performed by Na2S at 180 °C to form Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Fig. 1 a-b show the SEM images of the hydroxide intermediates, in which smooth nanosheets with planar size of ~268 nm and thickness of ~40 nm can be found. Diffractive peaks of Cd(OH)2 (marked by asterisks) and Zn(OH)2 (marked by dots) crystal planes can be detected in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1c), suggesting the complex nature of the hydroxide intermediates. After sulfurizing, typical diffraction peaks of (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0) planes of hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S (JCPDF no. 89-2943) can be observed in Fig. 1f, indicating the phase transformation from hydroxides to alloy sulfides. Unlike the smooth hydroxide sheets with irregular shape, the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets exhibit a typical hexagon shape with rather rough surface (Fig. 1d-e). The planar size and thickness are within 145–211 nm and 25–29 nm, respectively, which are smaller and thinner than those of the intermediates. The microstructure and elemental composition of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets were further studied by TEM-related techniques. From the different magnification TEM images (Fig. 2 a-c), the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets are composed of many nanocrystals. The particle size distribution image (Fig. S2) demonstrates the nanocrystals have an average size of 8 nm, indicating the nanosheets have a three-layer thickness of the nanocrystals. In the high-resolution TEM image of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets (Fig. 2c), lattice fringes with spacings of 0.32 and 0.35 nm can be observed, corresponding well to the hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) facets, respectively. This agrees well with the result of the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) (Fig. 2d), where strong diffractive rings of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (0 0 2), (1 1 0), and (2 0 0) planes can be clearly distinguished. The elemental EDX mappings taken from the region shown by the HAADF image (Fig. 2e) exhibit that the elemental Cd, Zn and S are distributed uniformly among the nanosheets, demonstrating the successful composition of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets. Further, OLC was used as the support for the growth of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The microstructure of OLC is shown by the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3 a), where a concentric circular structure with the lattice fringes of 0.41 nm can be found, which is a lightly larger than that of graphite (0.35 nm) [27]. The typical layer structure strongly indicates the sp2 hybridization of carbon, while the less continual lattice implies the poor crystalline quality and possible defects. Notes that OLC is liable to connect with each other and forms larger clusters with the length above 100 nm (detailed information can be found in the Supporting Information Fig. S3). After adding the OLC supports in the reaction solution of ZnCdS, similar sheet-like products were obtained as shown by the SEM images (Fig. 3b-c). Compared to pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets, the hybrids have much larger planar size (887 nm) and coarser surface, which maybe caused by the large size of OLC. Fig. 3d-f display the microstructure and lattice fringes of the ZnCdS-OLC hybrid. The lattice distance of the particular cores (marked by yellow arrows) and layered shells (marked by red arrows) indicates the hybrid nanosheets consist of dense Zn0.5Cd0.5S-OLC core-shell nanoparticles. The shells are continuous and have a thickness of ~4–5 carbon layer, which makes the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanocrystals to be completely wrapped by carbon layers, thus prompting the carrier transfer between the cores and the shells. By comparing the thickness of the nanosheets (~102 nm) and the size of the OLC aggregates, it can be estimated that the OLC may traverse the nanosheets along the vertical direction, providing conducting 3D network for the electron transfer. The effect of the morphology and OLC decoration on the optical property of ZnCdS was systematically studied. Fig. 4 a-b exhibit the light absorption of the ZnCdS QDs, ZnCdS nanosheets and ZnCdS-OLC hybrid nanosheet. Pure ZnCdS QDs have a typical absorption edge at ~506 nm, while the absorption edge of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets red shifts to 550 nm, corresponding to the band gap of 2.19 eV from the Tauc plot (detailed information can be found in Supporting Information Fig. S4a). And the optical absorption of QDs exhibited an apparent blue-shift compared to the nanosheets due to the quantum size effect [40]. After hybrid with OLC, the absorption edge of the ZnCdS sheets further red shifts to 570 nm accompanied with a long tail over the visible even the infrared region for the absorption, indicating the positive role of OLC on the light absorption [41]. The coupling of ZnCdS with OLC leads to the enhancement in the absorption property. It has been recognized by both experimental and theoretical studies that C dots have energy gaps with LUMO and HOMO levels because of the hybridization of sp2 and sp3 [42–44]. As one important member of C dots, OLC also has an energy gap of 2.74 eV according to the Tauc plot (Fig. S4b), and sp2 CC, sp3 CC, CH and CO bindings can be clearly found in the fine-scan XPS spectrum of the OLC in the composite nanosheets (Fig. S5), indicating the presence of the oxygenated surface functional groups. Negligible changes have been detected in the Zn 2p, Cd 3d and S 2p binding energies before and after the addition of OLC (Fig. S6), suggesting the poor interaction of OLC on the valence states and chemical environment of ZnCdS. As a comparison, thanks to the up-converted PL effect of OLC originated from the surface functional groups [27], the bi- or multiple photon absorption at the longer wavelengths may enable the OLC to serve as the second light source for ZnCdS, thus extends the light absorption range of the hybrid. Fig. 4b displays the corresponding PL spectra. Significant band edge luminescence can be detected at ~560 nm for pure ZnCdS QDs and nanosheets. After decorated by OLC, distinctive degradation occurs in the luminescence, indicating charge transfer happens between OLC and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, which will be beneficial for the photocatalytic property. Fig. 4c shows the photocatalytic H2 generation property of Zn0.5Cd0.5S QDs, nanosheets and Zn0.5Cd0.5S-OLC nanosheets. Pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S QDs has a very low H2 generation rate of 3.4 mmol/g/h. As a comparison, the rate increases to 6.4 mmol/g/h for the nanosheets, nearly 1.9 times of pure ZnCdS QDs. Further raise to 10.8 mmol/g/h has been established for the ZnCdS-OLC hybrids (5 wt%), much higher than the ZCS QDs-OLC composites. The result suggests that the superiority of the nanosheets over the QDs, and the introduction of OLC can greatly prompt the photocatalytic property. The nanosheet hybrids show an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 26.6% at 420 nm and good photocatalytic stability. As shown by the stability test with four consecutive cycles (Fig. 4d), the generation rate of H2 is relatively stable with negligible degradation with the prolonged time and cycles. Further PC property evolved with the addition amount of OLC (Fig. 4e-f) demonstrates that the H2 generation rate is higher than pure ZnCdS nanosheets for the hybrids with wt% from 3% to 6%. With the addition of the OLC, the H2 generation rate of the hybrids firstly increases then decreases, and reaches the optimum value of 10.8 mmol/g/h at 5 wt% OLC. Notes that the charge transfer can be benefited from the sp2 conjugation of OLC, and the presence of the surface functional groups prompt the light absorption. However, the poor crystal quality and surface defects of the OLC also provide plenty of recombination centers for the carriers, and excess addition of OLC may introduce more recombination centers in the ZnCdS-OLC nanosheets. Therefore, there exists a competition between them. The optimum photocatalyst property indicates the positive and negative effects of reach a balance at 5 wt% of OLC. The charge separation/transfer mechanism and the band alignment of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S-OLC hybrid nanosheets are presented in Fig. 5 . From the Valence band XPS spectrum and Mott-Schottky curve of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets (Fig. S7a-b), the valence band maximum (VBM), Fermi level (Ef) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets locate at 1.35 V, −0.37 V and −0.84 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively (detailed discussion can be found the supporting information). Combined with the reported HOMO and LUMO levels of 2.27 and −0.47 V (vs. RHE) for OLC [27], the Zn0.5Cd0.5S-OLC interface forms a typical “type II” band alignment, namely, both the valence and conduction bands lie above those of OLC. As exhibited by the mechanism diagram (right panel in Fig. 5), the photo-excited electrons will flow to the OLC side while the holes reversely to Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Notably, as shown by the left panel of Fig. 5, the ZnCdS-OLC core-sheath 2D structure can not only prompt the electrons transfer along the nanosheet planes, but also enhance the charge transport in the vertical direction, thus greatly benefits the charge separation and limits the carrier recombination at ZnCdS QD/QD interface. Indeed, the charge transfer resistance of the ZnCdS-OLC nanosheets has been deduced from the EIS spectra (Fig. S8), which is as low as 114 Ω, much smaller than those of pure ZnCdS nanosheets (465 Ω) and QDs (4763 Ω), indicating the enhancement of OLC on the charge transfer. The roles of OLC on the charge separation and transfer property, together with the effect on the extension on light responsive wavelength, lead to the enhancement of the photocatalytic property of the ZnCdS-OLC hybrid nanosheets."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, Zn0.5Cd0.5S hexagonal nanosheets and the hybridization with OLC have been studied for high-efficient photocatalytic H2 generation by a two-step solvothermal method. The Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets consist of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanocrystals and have a planar size of 145–211 nm and three-layer thickness (~25 nm) of the nanocrystals. The hybrid nanosheets are much larger, and are built by Zn0.5Cd0.5S-OLC core-sheath particles. Compared with Zn0.5Cd0.5S QDs, the hybrids and pure nanosheets show the red shifts to 570 nm and 550 nm in the light absorption edge, of which the former extensively exhibits an absorption tail till longer wavelength. The typical “type II” band alignment was revealed for the hybrid nanosheets, which together with the core-sheath nanosheet structure, greatly prompts the photo-excited charge separation at the Zn0.5Cd0.5S-OLC interface, and benefits the charge transfer along the parallel and perpendicular directions of the nanosheets. These finally lead to the enhanced hydrogen production rate of 10.8 mmol/g/h for the hybrid nanosheets, surpassing pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanosheets (6.4 mmol/g/h) and QDs (3.4 mmol/g/h). This work opens up as efficient way to improve the photocatalytic property by morphology and hetero-interface control."
