0,Introduction,"As one of the most promising clean and green energy carriers, hydrogen is regarded as the best alternative to solve the ongoing energy crisis and issues related to environmental pollution [1–4]. In recent decades, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has attracted great attention because of its high efficiency and eco-friendliness [5–9]. Although Platinum (Pt)-based metals are still the most effective electrocatalysts for HER, the scarcity and high cost severely restricted their practical and widespread application in the hydrogen production industry [10,11]. Thus, developing an earth-abundant and inexpensive electrocatalyst with excellent HER performance is critical to solve the hindrance in the implementation of electrochemical HER into industry application. Among all these alternatives, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has received tremendous attention as a prospective HER catalyst due to its high structural stability and catalytic activity [12,13]. Experimental and theoretical research revealed that only the edge sites of MoS2 were active for HER [12]. Numerous efforts have been devoted to enhancing the HER activity of MoS2 through exposing more edge sites, including phase engineering [14–19], defect engineering [20–27], nanostructure design [28–31], oxygen incorporation [8,32], hetero-elemental doping [33–38]. Despite the great progress achieved so far, increasing the catalytic activity of MoS2-based electrocatalysts on a par with commercial Pt-based electrocatalysts still remains a great challenge. Recently, extending the active surface area of MoS2 on other two-dimensional (2D) layer materials to form layer heterojunction is demonstrated to be an effective approach for producing more the edge sites. The carbon material of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a graphene like framework also has attracted numerous researchers to explore its photocatalytic and electrochemical properties for hydrogen generation [39,40]. Since g-C3N4 and MoS2 have analogous layered structures, building an organic-inorganic graphene-like thin layered heterojunction between them should minimize the lattice mismatch and facilitate the planar growth of MoS2 on the surface of g-C3N4 to obtain more the edge sites. Some studies have been proved that growing MoS2 nanosheets on the g-C3N4 nanosheets could enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light [41–43]. Furthermore, the Schottky heterojunction catalyst of MoB/g-C3N4 was also synthesized, which shows a remarkable HER activity [44]. Typically, the preparation procedure of 2D g-C3N4 is relatively complex, which takes a long time to remove impurities. Therefore, finding an effective method to obtain 2D g-C3N4 with a high crystallinity is significant. In this work, we report a MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 hybrid catalyst with remarkable HER activity enhancement by forming a layer heterojunction. It was found that S-doped g-C3N4 displays a high crystallinity with facilitating the interlayer charge transfer and exhibits an enhanced visible-light hydrogen generation rate [45]. A series of MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 hybrid catalyst with layer heterojunction structures were simply constructed by growing MoS2 on the surface of S-doped g-C3N4. As expected, coupling of S-doped C3N4 on the MoS2 (MoS2-C3N4) can enhance the HER activity of MoS2. The optimal hybrid catalyst shows a small onset overpotential as low as 115 mV, a low overpotential of 173 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a low Tafel slope of 53 mV decade−1, and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.16 H2 s−1 per active site at η = 150 mV. This study will provide an effective strategy to build MoS2-based layer heterojunction for enhancing HER performance by rationally coupling of two similar 2D layered structure materials."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2), melamine and D-penicillamine were obtained from Aladdin company, China. The deionized water (18 MΩ/cm) was supplied by a Water Purifier Nanopure system. All analytical reagent grade chemicals used as received without any further purification."
3,Synthesis of S-doped g-C3N4,"2.2 Synthesis of S-doped g-C3N4 16 mmol melamine powder and 2 mmol D-penicillamine powder were completely dissolved in 50 mL alcohol under an ultrasonic treatment for 30 min at room temperature. Then the mixed solution was refluxed at 80 °C for 3 h and dried in drying baker at 60 °C for overnight to remove alcohol. After that, the mixed resultants were sequentially annealed through three stages: 300 °C for 1 h, 400 °C for 1 h and 550 °C for 4 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the product with brown-color was collected and grinded for thermal oxidation etching at 500 °C for 2 h in air. And the final production was used for further characterization and catalytic reaction."
4,Synthesis of MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction catalyst,"2.3 Synthesis of MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction catalyst Typically, 1 mmol Na2MoO4 and 3 mmol thioacetamide were dissolved in 30 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring to form a homogeneous solution. 60 mg S-doped g-C3N4 was added into the above solution with stirring for 30 min and sonicating for 1 h. Then, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 24 h. After that, the reaction system was allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. The obtained products were washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C under vacuum. The final product was denoted as MoS2-C3N4-60. In order to optimize the HER activity of the hybrid catalyst, the samples with different mass ratio of MoS2 and S-doped g-C3N4 were also synthesized by the same procedure with using S-doped g-C3N4 of 0 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively. And the samples were denoted as MoS2, MoS2-C3N4-40, and MoS2-C3N4-80, respectively. And the MoS2-C3N4 mixture was obtained by mixing the pristine of MoS2 and 60 mg of S-doped g-C3N4."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Suzhou Shimadzu Instrument Co., Ltd., China) with two 1-cm cuvettes and the ethanol was used as solvent. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Bruker AXS D8-Advanced diffractometer with Cu K α radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The morphologies of the samples were analyzed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) from MERLIN Compact. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were obtained with a Philips CM 20 operating at 120 kV. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images and corresponding energy dispersive mapping were obtained on a FEI Tecnai Osiris with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Raman spectral experiments were carried out by a Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Al K α as the X-ray source for excitation."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements All of the electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode system on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua, China). Graphite rod and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl-filled) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. A glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 3 mm covered by a thin catalyst film and 20% commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts were used as the working electrode. Typically, 4 mg of catalyst and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%, DuPont) were dispersed in 1000 μL ethanol/water solution (volume ratio of 1:1) by sonicating for 60 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then, 5 μL of the dispersion (containing 20 μg of catalyst) was pipetted onto a glassy carbon electrode (loading 0.283 mg cm−2). HER tests were conducted in a N2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted between 0.0 and −0.8 V versus RHE with a scan rate of 10 mV S−1. The Nyquist plots were measured with frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at an overpotential of 250 mV. All of the final potentials have been calibrated with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.059 pH. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the as-prepared samples recorded in a non-Faradaic region (0.2–0.3 V vs. RHE) at various scan rates (from 5 to 25 mV S−1) were used to measure the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl). Stability tests were performed using a continuous CV technique in a potential scan range from 0.0 to −0.50 V vs. the RHE at 100 mV S−1 for multicycle operation (from 5000 cycles) and chronoamperometry technique (at current density of 20 mA/cm2)."
7,Results and discussion,"Firstly, XRD was used to characterize the structure of as-prepared g-C3N4 and S-doped C3N4 (Fig. S1). It can be seen that two pronounced peaks appear at 13.2° and 27.8° (Fig. S1(a)), which can be assigned to (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) crystal face characteristic of graphitic-like carbon nitride crystal structure. Compared with that of g-C3N4, the (0 0 2) peak of S-doped C3N4 shifts to a higher angle (Fig. S1(b)), indicating a decrease in the lattice distance in the c-axis direction. And it could facilitate the interlayer charge transfer owing to the strong interactions between the π-π stacked large aromatic supramolecular layers [45]. Thus, it is better to grow MoS2 on the surface of S-doped C3N4 to build layer heterojunction structures for enhancing HER activity of MoS2. XRD patterns of the as-synthesized MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction composites, as well as S-doped g-C3N4, are shown in in Fig. 1 . For pure MoS2, there are two apparent peaks at 32.6° and 57.3°, which can be assigned to (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) planes of MoS2 phase (JCPDS no. 73-1508). All the MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 hybrid hetereostructured samples shows the similar peaks with that of pure MoS2. And no obvious peaks related to S-doped g-C3N4 can be found in the hetereostructured samples, which reveals that S-doped g-C3N4 should have very thin layered structure after thermal oxidation etching. In addition, all the as-synthesized samples were studied by UV-Vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. S2, the pure MoS2 and S-doped C3N4 show the peaks at 240 nm and 315 nm, respectively. The absorption peaks of MoS2 in the MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 hybrid hetereostructured samples show a red-shift. And the red-shift increases with increasing the quantity of S-doped g-C3N4 in the MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 hybrid hetereostructured samples, indicating that MoS2 was successfully grew on the surface of the S-doped g-C3N4. Furthermore, there is also no obviously peak of S-doped g-C3N4 when increased the S-doped g-C3N4 to 200 mg, which indicates that the S-doped g-C3N4 was became thin layer after the thermal treatment [46,47]. And there is obviously peak of S-doped g-C3N4 in the physical mixture which demonstrated that the S-doped g-C3N4 shows the bulk morphology after physical mixing. The absorption peaks of physical mixture shows the different situations compared to the MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 hybrid hetereostructured samples. The peak of MoS2 shows the blue shift, while the peak of C3N4 shows the red shift which are shown in Fig. S3(b) in the revised manuscript. Thus, the red shift and no second peak are owing to the formation of the heterostructure. The morphology and microstructure of the pure MoS2, S-doped g-C3N4 and MoS2-C3N4-60 hybrid hetereostructured samples were analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 2 . Both of S-doped g-C3N4 and MoS2 show the 2D graphene-like nanosheet structure (Fig. 2(a) and (b)), suggesting that flowerlike of MoS2 and stacked lamellar structure of S-doped g-C3N4 were assembled from a large number of thin nanosheets. MoS2-C3N4-60 hybrid composites show the clearly interfacial contact (Fig. 2(c)), which confirms that the 2D layered heterojunction between MoS2 and S-doped g-C3N4 was successfully obtained. For comparison, the morphologies of MoS2-C3N4-40 and MoS2-C3N4-80 were also characterized by TEM (Fig. S4), which also have 2D layer heterojunction structure. In addition, a clear crystal lattice can be found in HRTEM image (Fig. 2(d)), which is corresponding to the (1 0 1) plane of MoS2. The 2D layer heterojunction structure is further characterized linear scan EDS analysis across a typical MoS2-C3N4-60 nanosheet (Fig. 2(e)). It can be seen that the signal of each element shows regular fluctuations, which directly confirms the interfacial contact between the MoS2 and the S-doped g-C3N4. In addition, elemental mapping analysis of MoS2-C3N4-60 in Fig. 2(f) clearly demonstrates that demonstrate that the Mo, S, C, and N signals spatially correlate with each other, indicating the close interfacial contacts between MoS2 and S-doped g-C3N4. The close interfacial contact may enhance the charge transfer between the MoS2 and C3N4 owing to the π-π stacked large aromatic supramolecular layers in the S-doped g-C3N4 which improve the HER activity. The chemical state of the MoS2 growing on the S-doped g-C3N4 was carefully examined by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the high resolution XPS spectrum of Mo 3d were deconvoluted into two peaks. The peak at 226.3 eV can be attributed to S 2s in the MoS2 and MoS2-C3N4-60. And two characteristic peaks of Mo 3d in MoS2 are located at 232.8 and 229.1 eV from Mo4+ 3d 3/2 and Mo4+ 3d 5/2, while the corresponding peaks of Mo 3d in MoS2-C3N4-60 from Mo4+ 3d 3/2 and Mo4+ 3d 5/2 orbitals were shifted negatively, indicative of the strong chemical interaction (electron coupling) between MoS2 and S-doped g-C3N4 [42] and increase of electron concentration on the surface of MoS2 owing to the electron transferred from S-doped g-C3N4 to MoS2. In addition, the similar negative shift was also observed on the high resolution XPS spectra of S 2p. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the S 2p XPS spectra of MoS2 exhibit two peaks at 161.3 eV (S 2p 3/2) and 163.2 eV (S 2p 1/2), which is consistent with −2 oxidation state of sulfur, while the S 2p XPS spectra of MoS2-C3N4-60 were negatively shifted 0.3 eV. Therefore, the electron density of S was also increased in MoS2-C3N4-60. According the above analysis, building MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction can adjust the electron structure of MoS2 layer, which may be benefit to enhance the HER activity of MoS2. The HER activities of MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction samples were evaluated in a typical three-electrode system in N2-saturated H2SO4 electrolyte (0.5 M). As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the pure MoS2 sample shows a relative poor HER activity with an onset overpotential of 174 mV (denoted as the overpotential at the current density of 1 mA/cm−2) and an overpotential of 240 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2 with versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. In contrast, the MoS2-C3N4-60 exhibits an onset overpotential of 115 mV at the current density of 1 mA/cm−2 and an overpotential of 173 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2, which are much smaller than these of the pure MoS2, respectively. In addition, the MoS2-C3N4-60 exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity than the mixture of MoS2 and S-doped C3N4 (Fig. S5). These results demonstrate that building MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction is an effective method to enhance the HER activity of MoS2. Furthermore, the none S doping C3N4 coupled with MoS2 shows the worse HER activity than the MoS2-C3N4-60, indicating that the S doping is important to enhancing the HER activity. In addition, the overpotential of the MoS2-C3N4-60 catalysts is also smaller than that of MoS2-C3N4-40 (222 mV) and MoS2-C3N4-80 (223 mV), suggesting that the HER activities of MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction is dependent on the quantity of the S-doped g-C3N4 in the samples. Tafel slope as the intrinsic HER activity of the catalysts are obtained from the LSV curves. Generally, the lower Tafel slope of the catalyst means the faster kinetics and higher catalytic activity. In addition, the value of Tafel plot shows the rate-limiting step of the HER. The HER mechanism in acid can be divided into two different mechanisms: (1) Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (H+(aq) + e− → Hads (Volmer reaction) and Hads + H+(aq) + e− → H2 (g) (Heyrovsky reaction)) and/or (2) Volmer − Tafel mechanism (H+(aq) + e− → Hads (Volmer reaction) and Hads + Hads → H2 (g)(Tafel reaction)) [46]. Under a set of temperature (25 °C), a Tafel slope of 118 mV/dec indicates the rate-limiting is Volmer reaction, whereas obtained Tafel slopes of 39 mV/dec and 29 mV/dec indicate the rate-limiting are Heyrovsky reaction and Tafel reaction, respectively [48]. Therefore, an adsorption/desorption of H atoms competitive processes occurs at the surface of the catalyst, which should be optimized to improve HER activity of the catalyst. Tafel plots of pure MoS2, MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 and 20% Pt/C were calculated from the corresponding polarization curves, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The Tafel equation is employed to fit the linear portion of the plots: η = b log j + a where η, j, b, and a denote the overpotential, Tafel slope, current density, and a constant, respectively. The Tafel slope of Pt/C catalyst is ∼34 mV/dec, in line with the value as reported in the previous study [8]. The Tafel slopes are calculated to be 67 mV/dec (MoS2-C3N4-40), 53 mV/dec (MoS2-C3N4-60) and 58 mV/dec (MoS2-C3N4-80), which are apparently lower than 65 mV/dec (pure MoS2), demonstrating significantly improved catalytic activity of MoS2 by building MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction. Furthermore, the rate-limiting step of the MoS2-C3N4-60 and other samples are the Heyrovsky reaction. And the molecular hydrogen is generated by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism (Hads + H+(aq) + e− → H2). The exchange current density (j0) can be calculated based on the Tafel equation by calculating the intercept of the linear Tafel plots to the x-axis (where the thermaldynamic redox potential at 0 mV). The MoS2-C3N4-60 catalyst shows the j0 value of 8.31 μA/cm2, which is bigger than that of pure MoS2 (2.45 μA/cm2), MoS2-C3N4-40 (5.75 μA/cm2) and MoS2-C3N4-80 (1.62 μA/cm2). To further evaluate the intrinsic activity of active sites, the turnover frequency (TOF, the amount of H2 molecules produced from one active site per second) is calculated to study the intrinsic activity of the catalyst [49,50]. The CV cycles and the polarization curves with normalized for the active sites expressed in terms of TOF are shown in Fig. S6 and Fig. 4(c), respectively. And the obtained TOF values of MoS2-C3N4-60 is 0.16 S-1 at an overpotential of −0.15 V. Durability of the MoS2-C3N4-60 was tested based on CV and chronoamperometry techniques. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the polarization curves of MoS2-C3N4-60 before and after 5000 cycles sweeps are close to each other, even in the high overpotential region. In additional, HER measurements was conducted with an overpotential remaining constant for up to 24 h and the current density also showing minimal change. These results demonstrate the robust stability of the MoS2-C3N4-60 sample for HER in strong acid. And the MoS2-C3N4-60 shows better HER performance than previously reported catalysts (Table S1). Obviously, the HER activities of the MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 layered heterojunction were enhanced with increasing the mass of S-doped g-C3N4 and then decreased with further increasing the mass of S-doped g-C3N4. To elucidate the mechanism of the above phenomenon, we analyze the HER activities of the catalyst from the aspects of electronic conductivity and active sites, which are consider to be the most critical factors for the HER activities. First, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are tested in the frequency range 10 kHz to 0.1 kHz to understand the HER kinetics happening at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Fig. 5 (a) shows the Nyquist plots of the catalysts. It can be seen that the charge transfer resistance of the MoS2-C3N4-60 catalyst is smaller than that of pristine MoS2 and other MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 samples, indicating a faster electron pass process in HER kinetics. And the smallest charge transfer resistance of the MoS2-C3N4-60 could be probably attributed to the enhancement of interdomain conductivity by proper coupling MoS2 on the surface of S-doped g-C3N4. MoS2-C3N4-40 shows the highest charge transfer resistance, owing to the little couple between S-doped g-C3N4 and MoS2, which is not sufficient to enhance electron transfer between the MoS2 and S-doped g-C3N4. MoS2-C3N4-80 shows the bigger charge transfer resistance than MoS2-C3N4-60, owing to the more S-doped g-C3N4 coupled with MoS2. And more S-doped g-C3N4 in MoS2-C3N4-60 would decrease the exposing active sites of the MoS2, which is consistent with the TEM in Fig. S4(b). Moreover, the active site in the MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 samples is another parameter to elucidate the mechanism. To estimate the effective electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the samples, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) which is expected to be linearly proportional to the ECSA was determined based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. Fig. S7 shows CV curves of all the prepared samples at various scan rates (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mV s−1) in the 0.2–0.3 V versus RHE region. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the Cdl of the samples can be calculated based on the cyclic voltammograms. The double-layer capacitance was estimated by plotting the Δj (j a − j c) at 0.25 V versus RHE against the scan rate and were obtained by linear calibration of the slope. The values of Cdl are equal to half of the slopes of these plots. Obviously, the Cdl value of MoS2-C3N4-60 is measured to be 9.8 mF/cm2, which is bigger than that of pure MoS2(6.8 mF/cm2)and other MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 sample (7.2 mF/cm2 for MoS2-C3N4-40, and 4.4 mF/cm2 for MoS2-C3N4-80), indicating that the MoS2-C3N4-60 has a high ECSA and more effective active sites, which certainly leads to its highest catalytic activity. In addition, MoS2-C3N4-60 has the best conductivity since the Cdl is proportional to the conductivity and the surface area of the materials [30], which in line with the results of the EIS measurements."
8,Conclusion,"In this work, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy to optimize HER catalytic activity of MoS2 by contacting S-doped g-C3N4 to form a 2D layered heterojunction. The optimized MoS2-C3N4-60 catalyst exhibits a superior and durable HER performance with a small onset overpotential as low as 115 mV. In addition, MoS2-C3N4-60 shows a low overpotential of 173 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2 with a low Tafel slope of 53 mV decade−1. And a high TOF of 0.16 H2 s−1 per active site can be achieved at η = 150 mV. And the best HER activity can be attribute to the follow three reasons: the higher charge transfer rate in MoS2/S-doped g-C3N4 samples, electron structure adjusting for enhancing HER activity and more active sites exposing. This finding proposes an effective strategy to enhance HER activities of MoS2 by building 2D layered heterojunction."
