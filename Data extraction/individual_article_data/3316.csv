0,Introduction,"Gasification is a promising technology for converting low-grade biomass and wastes into an intermediate product, known as “synthesis gas” or “syngas”, which is suitable for use in a wide spectrum of applications including the generation of energy and the production of chemicals and liquid fuels. According to the chemical composition and the typical applications, two kinds of synthesis gas can be identified, namely the product gas and the biosyngas (bio-SNG) [1]. The product gas is obtained by gasification processes performed at low temperature (below 1000 °C) and consists in a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), CxHy aliphatic hydrocarbons, benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8) and tars in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O) [2]. Because of its complex chemical composition, the product gas is mainly applied for the generation of thermal energy and electrical power (indirect gasification) either in stand-alone combined heat and power (CHP) plant or through the existing co-firing technologies [3], whereas advanced synthesis routes of chemical and fuels are not the preferred option. The bio-SNG is produced by either high temperature (above 1200 °C) or catalytic gasification processes and consists in a mixture of CO and H2 with small quantities of CO2 and CH4 [4]. It can also be obtained from the product gas by additional treatments of thermal cracking or catalytic reforming. Biosyngas has a chemical composition similar to that of syngas derived from fossil sources and, accordingly, can replace the latter in all its applications, which include in particular CHP generation in gas engines, turbines and fuel cells, synthesis of liquid fuels via Fisher–Tropsch process, conversion into gaseous fuels such as hydrogen and substitute natural gas (SNG) and, finally, the production of chemicals such as methanol (CH3OH), dimethyl ether (C2H6O), ammonia (NH3) and oxo-alcohols [5]. A detailed overview of the main reactions and uses of biosyngas can be found in Wender [6]. Additional treatments of cleaning and conditioning are typically required for both the kinds of syngas in order to meet the requirements for the final application in terms of both H2:CO:CO2 ratios and level of impurities. A detailed overview of the main specifications for the major applications of syngas is provided by Boerrigter and Rauch [5]. Commonly, the non-catalytic high temperature routes involve the application of an entrained flow gasifier, while the catalytic ones, which require lower temperature levels, involve the utilization of either fixed or fluidized bed gasifiers with a catalytic reformer unit downstream for the conversion of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons into H2 and CO [3]. Fixed and entrained flow gasification can be considered as direct gasification technologies where the oxidizing agent, typically consisting of air, partly oxidizes the feedstock to provide the heat required for the endothermic gasification reactions. The utilization of pure oxygen in place of air is advisable for gasification processes involved in biomass to biofuels/biochemicals conversion chains, since a nitrogen-free syngas is typically required for the synthesis step. On the downside, providing pure oxygen requires an air separation unit, which involves high capital and operational costs, thus adversely affecting overall efficiency and economics of the process [7]. Indirect gasification is able to produce a gas with a very low nitrogen content instead, making it suitable for the subsequent synthesis of biofuels and chemicals. Interconnected fluidized bed technology allows for such type of gasification by using two fluidized bed reactors, namely a gasifier and a combustor [8] so that the energy required for feedstock gasification in the first reactor is supplied by char combustion in the second one via circulation of inert bed material between the reactors. Typically, the combustion reactor is fluidized by air while the gasifier uses as fluidization medium either CO2 or steam. The chemical looping gasification rests on this same principle (indirect gasification), still using two interconnected fluidized beds, but uses an oxygen carrier (metal oxide particles) instead of inert solids (e.g. sand) as bed material, which provides both lattice oxygen and heat needed for the overall process [9]. This approach has several potential advantages over the conventional indirect gasification. First, all the fuel is essentially converted in the fuel reactor and none in the air reactor, thus reducing the volume of the gas that needs clean-up and, hence, the cost of the gas cleaning. Secondly, replacing the inert bed material with metal oxides lead to additional benefits, including the catalytic abatement of tars [10], improved char gasification rates due to lattice oxygen uncoupling, less content of species that inhibit char gasification rates [11], and increased H2:CO ratio by promoting specific reactions [12]. Typically, the syngas obtained by pure oxygen gasification has the highest heating values in the range of 12–28 MJ/Nm3, followed by steam (10–18 MJ/Nm3) and air gasification (4–7 MJ/Nm3) [13]. The different gasification technologies typically require specific feed qualities and have different operational and, most importantly, capacity ranges. Indicative values for the different parameters are summarized in Ref. [13]. In detail, while fixed bed gasification is more suitable for small-scale applications (below 50 MWth input), fluidized bed and entrained flow gasification suits for medium (10–100 MWth input) to large-scale (over 100 MWth input) applications, respectively. Since the final price of the gasification gas might be subjected to fluctuation depending on the adopted plant design, feedstock type, co-product generated and local conditions, only costs and performances data are able to establish the potential of a specific gasification technology to become competitive for a specific end-use [14]. For instance, at a first sight, the high temperature gasification route would appear the most suitable for the synthesis of chemicals and liquid biofuels, since it yields a clean and high calorific value biosyngas in one step. However, it should be noted that high temperature gasification processes are mainly related to oxygen-blown entrained-flow gasifiers, which mostly work under pressure (typically 2–5 MPa) and have a capacity of several hundreds of MWth. Due to the need for oxygen, for example, this approach to gasification is not recommended for decentralized biomass-based power generation (up to approximately 50 MWth) [1]. Among the gasification technologies considered, the fluidized-bed gasification seems to be one of the most promising for the treatment of biomass and wastes due to its operating flexibility, which makes it possible to adopt different fluidizing agents (e.g., air, oxygen, steam, CO2, or a mixture of them), gas residence times, temperatures, in addition to use of specific catalysts directly inside the reactor without the need of a downstream catalytic unit [15]. In the last decades, the production of bio-SNG has attracted increasing attention due the ever-growing demand for natural gas and the need for the mitigation of the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, as well as from the point of view of security of supply [16]. Today's established technology involves fermenting wet biomass and wastes (e.g., slurries, manures and organic residues from food processing with dry solids content in the range of 5–30%) through anaerobic digestion and upgrading the resulting biogas (approximately 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide) to produce grid-quality methane [17]. To further increase the production of bio-synthetic natural gas, recently, much interest has also been focused on the gasification technology, which suits for a wider variety of feedstocks, including in particular lignocellulosic biomasses with dry solids content greater than 40%, and ensures a significantly higher production capacity [18]. Feedstocks with high water content (above 40%), in particular, can be processed by means of supercritical water gasification (SCWG) technique, a hydrothermal treatment in which water at supercritical conditions (temperature above 374 °C and pressure above 22.1 MPa) is used. At medium temperatures (<550 °C), a carbon rich syngas consisting mainly of a carbon dioxide and methane [19] can be produced, while an hydrogen rich syngas can be obtained at higher temperatures (>550 °C) [20]. However, it should be noted that SCWG demands higher power with respect to any other gasification processes to upgrade the processing medium into supercritical conditions. Several reactor concepts have been proposed and investigated in literature [21] to carry out methanation reaction, ranging from multiple adiabatic layers fixed beds with inter-cooling and optional product recycle (e.g. TREMP or Lurgi methanation) to fluidized bed reactors (e.g. COMFLUX methanation), in order to contain the temperature rise associated to the highly exothermic Sabatier reaction, and to avoid catalyst sintering while approaching the best thermodynamic condition for the process [22]. Regardless of the adopted gasification process design, due to the intrinsic elemental composition of biomass, the gas obtained by its gasification typically lacks the hydrogen amount required to completely reform the biomass carbon content into methane. Accordingly, a water gas shift reactor before methanation unit is typically required in order to adjust the H2:CO:CO2 ratio in the synthesis gas to the optimal value. Due to the increasing integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and photovoltaic energy, into power grids the demand for the temporal and spatial matching between supply of renewable energy and local demand is growing [23]. Power-to-Gas (PtG) technologies, therefore, are taking on an increasingly important role as they allow converting excess renewable energy into hydrogen by water electrolysis, thus ensuring the greater stability of the power grids with high penetration of renewable energy sources in addition to the production of alternative fuels for vehicles and thermal uses. However, the short-term deployment of hydrogen-based economy is limited by the lack of well-established infrastructures and hydrogen markets [24]. Accordingly, alternative polygeneration schemes based on more established energy products, such as synthetic natural gas (power-to-SNG concept), are currently under investigation [24]. In this scenario, the integration of biomass gasification technology and power-to-SNG concept has been investigated by combining gasification experiments in pre-pilot scale fluidized bed reactor with mathematical modelling for the catalytic methanation unit. Among other things, the integration of biomass gasification with power-to-SNG technology offers an interesting option to reduce the investment and operation costs of SNG production from syngas compared to conventional plants with water-gas shift units [25]; in fact, when electrolytic hydrogen is fed to the catalytic methanation unit, the external adjustment of the H2:CO:CO2 ratio by water gas shift reaction is no longer needed. The performances of the system are evaluated by adopting commercial wood pellets as feedstock, an iron catalyst as bed materials in the gasifier and pure air or air-steam mixture as the oxidizing agent. The configuration adopted for methanation unit consists of three adiabatic fixed bed reactors with gas recycle and inter-stage cooling to displace the gas temperature in the direction of higher equilibrium conversion. The performances of the methanation system are estimated by considering that the syngas stream coming from the gasifier system reacts with a pure H2 stream coming from an electrolysis cells array (EC) over a Ni supported on alumina catalyst."

2,Gasification unit,"2.1 Gasification unit A pre-pilot gasification plant equipped with a fluidized bed gasifier – described in detail in [26] – was used to carry out gasification tests. The fuel is fed in under-bed mode 16 cm above the conical distributor of the reactor and its flow rate is regulated by means of a double-screw feeder. An electrical tubular steam generator provides steam at moderate gauge pressure (10 kPa) and temperature up to 400 °C. Produced steam is mixed with a preheated air stream (600 °C) and then fed to the gasifier. A cyclone and a ceramic filter (2 μm nominal opening) in series are used for gas de-dusting. The concentrations of the permanent gases are measured on-line with an ABB continuous analyzer equipped with InfraRed (IR) detectors for CO, CO2, and CH4 and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2. Gaseous samples are also collected in 1 L bags and off-line analyzed by means of a microgas-chromatograph Agilent 3000A to determine the presence of hydrocarbon different from methane (up to C5). TAR sampling is carried out through a dedicated line for about 20 min under steady-state conditions, i.e. once permanent gas profiles were unchanging. Collected samples are firstly weighed and then dissolved in dichloromethane in order to separate the condensed water from the tar sample. The TAR concentration, after extraction by dichloromethane, is calculated as the ratio of the weight of the collected samples to the total volume of collected gases. TAR speciation is carried out by off-line analysis by means of a gas chromatograph (HP 9600 series). Elutriated fine sampling is carried out for the same amount of time reported above to evaluate the solids elutriation rates. Collected elutriated fines are weighted and characterized by means of a LECO CHN analyzer. The elutriation rate is finally calculated as the ratio of the amount of collected fines to the sampling period. More details on the experimental apparatus, catalyst preparation procedure and its characterization, and sampling procedure can be found in Ref. [26]. Commercial pellets (spruce wood, 6 × 10−3 m diameter, 3 ÷ 4 × 10−2 m length, 1149 kg/m3 and 476 kg/m3 apparent and bulk densities, respectively) were used as fuel. Table 1 reports the proximate and ultimate analyses, along with an estimation of the LHV, of the samples carried out using a LECO TG701 and a LECO CHN 628, respectively. The gasification performances under the adopted experimental conditions have been compared in terms of average gas composition, amount of tar produced, and elutriated collected fines. The gasification tests are performed using the same catalyst (Fe/Al2O3 catalyst), reported [26] to be stable, at fixed equivalent ratio (ER = 0.17) and temperature (800 °C). The other operating conditions are reported in Table 2 , along with the list of both the gasification tests purposely performed in this work and those previously reported in Ref. [26], identified as test 1 and 3, carried out in the same experimental apparatus, using the same catalyst but different operating conditions."
3,Methanation unit,"2.2 Methanation unit The CO/CO2 methanation reaction mechanisms for syngas methanation over Ni-based catalyst proposed by Ref. [27] is considered. For readers convenience, Table 3 summarizes adopted reactions and associated enthalpy variations. In Table 3 R1 and R3 represent the CO and CO2 methanation reactions while R2 is the reverse water gas shift reaction. The kinetic rate models can be expressed as described in Eqs. (1)–(4) according to Ref. [27]: (1) R 1 = k 1 P H 2 2.5 ( P CH 4 P H 2 O − P CO P H 2 3 K eq , 1 ) DEN 2 (2) R 2 = k 2 P H 2 ( P CO P H 2 O − P CO 2 P H 2 K eq , 2 ) DEN 2 (3) R 3 = k 3 P H 2 3.5 ( P CH 4 P H 2 O 2 − P CO 2 P H 2 4 K eq , 3 ) DEN 2 where: (4) DEN = 1 + K CH 4 P CH 4 + K CO P CO + K H 2 P H 2 + K H 2 O P H 2 O P H 2 In Eqs (1)–(4) Rj, Keq,j and kj are the reaction rate, equilibrium constant, and kinetic rate constant of reaction j (j = 1, 2, 3), respectively, while pi and Ki are the partial pressure and adsorption constant of species i (i = CH4, CO, H2, H2O), respectively. All the above kinetic parameters, depending on temperature, are given in Arrhenius-function form in Table 4 . Both reactions R1 and R3 (Table 3) are strongly exothermic and characterized by a substantial volume contraction. Therefore, high pressures and low temperatures are optimal conditions for methanation reactions. The high reaction enthalpy associated to the above reactions results in large potential adiabatic temperature increase that may cause catalyst sintering and possibly leads to carbon particles formation. The reported methanation process is carried out in a series of adiabatic fixed bed reactors with nickel-based catalysts and inter-cooling between each stage. A schematic layout scheme of the reported methanation unit (MR) is depicted in Fig. 2 . After entering the reactor, the temperature of the gas mixture rises because of the exothermicity of the methanation reaction. Accordingly, for the first reactor where the highest temperature increase occurs, to not exceed the 700 °C causing catalyst sintering [21] and carbon deposition [28], the temperature control is achieved with help of product recirculation so to increase the water content in the fed. The recycle ratio (molar gas flow rate of the recycle related to the outlet of the reactor) is typically chosen in a range between 0.5 and 3.0 for methanation reactors [29]. At the exit of each reactor stage, cooling and water condensing occur so to partially remove water and adjust the dew point of the gas, shifting the equilibrium towards the products. Fed stream coming up from gasification unit is mixed with H2 HP-PEM unit and cooled up to 300 °C before entering the first reactor of MR. Due to the decrease in reactants, the temperatures at the inlet of the second and third MR units will be higher as will be discussed later. Finally, methanation unit inlet pressure prior to the methanation achieving high reactant conversion was set to 20 bar, according to Ref. [21] so to achieve high conversion degree. To describe axial temperature and concentration profiles in each fixed-bed methanation reactor, a numerical 1D model has been used. It was assumed that the reactor is adiabatic and pseudo-homogeneous, hence neglecting the heat and mass transfer resistances between the phases and within the catalyst [22]. Finally, homogeneous properties are considered and catalyst surface is assumed to be completely exposed to the bulk fluid conditions, so that fluid-to-particle heat and mass transfer resistances are neglected. The material balances for each gas component (i = CH4, CO, CO2, H2, H2O, N2) was written as: (5) ε ∂ c i ∂ t = − u sg ∂ c i ∂ z − ( 1 − ε ) ρ c r i For all the symbols see the Nomenclature Section. In Eq. (5) ri, is determined by summing up the reaction rates of that species in all the reactions Rj (see Table 3) according to the stochiometric coefficient as follow: (6) r i = ∑ j = 1 3 ν i , j R j Since reactions occur with a reduction in moles, the gas superficial velocity (usg) can be calculated accounting for overall mass conservation as: The gas superficial velocity (usg) has been calculated as: (7) u sg ( z , t ) = PM in T ( z , t ) PMT in u sg , in where the subscript in refers to the inlet conditions. Finally, the energy balances were written as: (8) ( ε ρ g c pg + ( 1 − ε ) ρ c c pc ) ∂ T ∂ t = − u sg ρ g c pg ∂ T ∂ z + ( 1 − ε ) ρ c ∑ j = 1 3 ( − Δ H j ) R j The mathematical model (Eqs. (5)–(8)) has been completed with the following boundary and initial conditions: (9) c i ( 0 , t ) = c i , in , c i ( z , 0 ) = 0 T ( 0 , t ) = T i , in , T ( z , 0 ) = T 0 The inlet concentrations in Eq. (9) depend on the gasifier outlet. The values of the parameters used in the simulations are reported in Table 5 . Partial differential equations governing reactor dynamics were reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations by the application of finite differences over a uniform grid of 200 discretization nodes. The reduced set of ordinary differential equations have been numerically solved by making use of the Fortran library DLSODES (e.g. Ref. [30])."
4,Hydrogen production unit,"2.3 Hydrogen production unit An array of high-pressure polymer electrolyte membrane cells (HP-PEM) has been used to model the hydrogen production unit. The number of HP-PEMs to be arranged in the array was evaluated by considering that a constant hydrogen production in order to have a 7:1:1H2:CO:CO2 ratios at the inlet of the methanation unit should be attained to convert the whole CO/CO2 stream produced by the gasification. For the evaluation of the number of HP-PEMs to be arranged in the array, data from commercially available units were considered [31]. Accordingly, a nominal H2 production flowrate of 100 Nm3/h and an electric energy efficiency equal to 46.6 kWh/kgH2 were taken into account."
5,Results and discussion,"The gasification results obtained in the different tests are reported in Table 6 and Fig. 3 . Hydrogen is the most abundant component of the syngas followed by CO and CO2. About 4–5%vol. of methane and very small amount of ethane and ethylene (neglected in subsequent methanation step) are present, in agreement with previous results obtained by Ref. [26]. The presence of steam in the feed strongly enhances the H2:CO ratio of the produced syngas (Fig. 3). Increasing the bed height improves the hydrogen and CO production whatever the gas velocity, even if the H2:CO ratio for higher height is lower than that obtained with a lower bed inventory, suggesting that larger amounts of catalysts promote the hydrocarbon oxidation (no ethane and ethylene are obtained). Conversely, given that a bed height increase poorly affects the tar amount produced, it can be speculated that the tar conversion reactions (cracking, reforming, et cetera) were limited by factors other than catalyst quantities. As a proof of this, a marked reduction of produced tar can be observed when the gas superficial velocity is increased for a given bed height. This behavior is likely to be a direct consequence of the in bed enhanced solids mixing that reduces the fuel segregation promoting the release of volatiles in the bed. It should be stressed, however, that the higher the gas superficial velocity the higher the elutriation rate. As already stated, the additional hydrogen required for the methanation process comes from the HP-PEM system. According to reactions’ stoichiometries (R1- R3 in Table 3), the stoichiometric number (SN) for the composition of the feed is: (10) SN = mol H 2 − mol CO 2 mol CO 2 + mol CO The SN value is 3, as reported by Ref. [22], and according to this value the hydrogen demand by HP-PEM unit has been calculated. Fig. 4 reports gas molar fractions time series at reactors exit for a gas inlet composition corresponding to test 1 in Table 6. Similar results were found for all the case reported in Table 6. Clearly, the methane molar fraction increases moving along the reactor series while the fractions of all the other reactants decrease. Under the same operating conditions, the time series of the temperature at the exit of each reactor in MR are depicted in Fig. 5 . The adiabatic temperature increase in the first, second, and last reactor is 350 °C, 200 °C, and 50 °C, respectively. The reactant contents decrease moving along the MR unit and then temperature achieved in the first reactor is greater than that achieved in the second and third reactor respectively. In particular in Fig. 6 are depicted spatial temperature profiles when the regime conditions are attained. A sudden temperature increase close to the inlet occurs in the first reactor (Fig. 6) and gas quickly reaches the equilibrium conditions. Decreasing the amount of reactants in input to the second and the third reactor, a smoother temperature change can be observed. To gain insight about the effectiveness of the displace of gas temperature in the direction of higher equilibrium conversion by intermediate cooling, the evolution of the H2 conversion is reported in Fig. 7 for 3 methanation reactors as well as the adiabatic temperature effect. Each diagonal solid line represents an adiabatic reactor (inlet and outlet conditions), and each horizontal dashed line represents an intermediate cooling and the dashed-dot curve the equilibrium conditions. Thermodynamic calculation method to obtain the equilibrium curve reported in Fig. 7 is based on the minimization of the free Gibbs energy [32]. At the exit of the first reactor a hydrogen conversion of 69.5% is achieved, 89.4% at the exit of the second and 97.5% of the last reactor. Similarly, the CO2 conversion (not reported in Fig. 7) is 58.2%, 83.2%, and 96.2% at the exit of the first, second and last reactor, respectively. Finally, carbon monoxide is essentially converted into the first two reactors of the series. In fact, at the output of the first and second reactor there is a conversion of 83.9% and 97.8% respectively. In the last reactor an almost full CO conversion is reached. Main results for the methanation unit are reported in Table 7 . Methane molar fraction on dry basis ranges from 37% to 45%. Moreover, in all the investigated case an almost full CO and very high H2 conversions are attained. A not complete conversion of CO2 is attained, and this is particularly significant for test 5 characterized by a very low CO2 content in the fed. It should be noted here that, given that CO methanation (R1) is more exothermic than CO2 one (R2), the higher the CO:CO2 ratio in the fed, the higher the recycle ratio has to be so to operate the process well below 700 °C. It is worth to note that tests 2 and 4, although having different CO:CO2 ratios, have the same recycle ratio since test 2 is the one with the lowest amount of nitrogen in the feed (see Table 6). The H2 stream supplied by HP-PEM unit ranges between a minimum 0.01417 for the test 4 to a maximum of 0.01825 molH2 s−1 for test 6 (Table 7)."
6,Conclusions,"In this paper, an innovative process layout to promote the integration among a fluidized bed for biomass gasification, solar hydrogen, and syngas methanation was proposed and investigated. Spruce wood pellets were fed to a fluidized bed gasifier system that uses Fe/Al2O3 as catalyst. Results show that adding steam to air as a gasification agent allows to enhance the H2:CO ratio as well as to decrease the concentration of CO2 into the product gas. This, in turn, not only means a lower H2 supply by the HP-PEM unit, but also a lower amount of carbon from biomass that is lost as carbon dioxide in the stream leaving the methanation unit, with a consequent increase in the carbon conversion efficiency of the global process. Similar benefits are expected when plastic materials take part in the fuel blend composition due to the higher H/C ratio in plastics compared to biomass and deserve further investigation in future research. The produced syngas is considered to be fed, after purification and mixing with a pure hydrogen stream coming from HP-PEM system, to a methanation unit consisting of three adiabatic fixed bed reactors in series with inter-cooling, water condensation and removal, and product recycle. Different recycle ratios has been investigated so to achieve high reactor performances while limiting temperature increase in order to avoid both catalyst sintering and carbon deposition. Very promising results were obtained. In all the considered cases, almost complete (99.9%) along with very high conversions of CO and CO2 to CH4 were respectively achievable. This, in turn, significantly increases the LHV of the gaseous stream with respect to that of the syngas before methanation. Moreover, the stream leaving the methanation unit has a nitrogen content comparable with that occurring in some natural gas fields [33]."
