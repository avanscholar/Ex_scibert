0,Introduction,"Increasing fossil fuel energy consumption & demand and environmental problems are driving more and more research activities to renewable energy field, which focus on recovering energy such as heat, ethanol, diesel, biogas and hydrogen as well as other useful substances (fertilizer) from varied waste streams by using thermo-chemical/bio-conversion, aerobic/anaerobic fermentation, etc. [1–8]. Among these different alternative energy carriers, hydrogen is regarded as an ideal one due to its high energy density by mass and clean combustion characteristics, and its production from a wide variety of renewable organic waste by anaerobic fermentation is attracting increasing interest [6–8]. A number of studies on hydrogen fermentation from glucose, sucrose and food waste were reported [9,10], and some efficient pretreatment strategies, such as acidification, steam explosion and microwave irradiation, were employed for improving hydrogen production from agricultural stalk waste [11–13]. These pretreatment processes which could destroy cell microstructure and increase the porosity of these wastes enhanced the hydrolysis process of lignocellulosic waste which has low biodegradability [12,13]. Up to date, there is still a great interest to develop novel strategies for improving bio-hydrogen production from the renewable lignocellulosic waste. Recently, hydrogen fermentation of lignocellulosic waste was improved via thermophilic cellulose-degrading and/or hydrogen-producing microorganisms such as Clostridium thermocellum, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus [14–16]. In addition, crude cellulase was also introduced to enhance hydrogen fermentation of lignocellulosic waste [11,17]. Compared to physical and chemical pretreatment methods, enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic waste was regarded as an energy-saving and environmentally friendly pretreatment process. However, the high production cost of the cellulase and the relatively low cellulase activity under mesophilic conditions limited its large-scale application in bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste into bio-hydrogen. The aim of this current study is to develop a promising method for enhancing hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation of raw cornstalk mixed with the pretreated cornstalk by Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30. The effects of fungal pretreatment time and blending ratio on the cornstalk hydrolysis and the resulting hydrogen production were investigated. The mechanism on enhancement of hydrogen production was discussed by analyzing cellulase activity in the fermentation broth."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cornstalk was collected from Daxing district, Beijing, China. It was dried in air and milled to 18-mesh powder (1mm) by a miller. The powder was dried in an oven at 60°C for 24h before use. The main components of cornstalk were as follows (%, w/w, on dry weight basis): cellulose 36.5, hemicellulose 31.3 and lignin 11.9."
3,Fungal pretreatment,"2.2 Fungal pretreatment Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 was grown in solid potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium composed of 20% potato, 2% glucose and 2% agar. The liquid mycelial cultures were used as inoculum for the following fungal treatment experiments [18]. In brief, three small pieces (3×6mm) of 5-day-old mycelial cultures were transferred from the PDA slant to 250mL Erlenmeyer flask with 50mL autoclaved liquid medium (pH 6.2) composed of 6% spent grain, 0.5% glucose and 0.8% (NH4)2SO4. The liquid inoculum was cultivated on a rotary shaker (150rpm) at 30°C for 2days. The liquid mycelial cultures were then homogenized by high-speed stir in a blender before it was used as the inoculum in fungal pretreatment experiments. The fungal pretreatment was carried out by solid state fermentation. 8g grounded raw cornstalk and 20mL nutrient solution composed with 1.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.6% MgSO4·7H2O and 0.3% KH2PO4 were added into a 250mL Erlenmeyer flask. Prior to autoclaving at 121°C for 25min, the pH of the medium was adjusted to 6 using 1M NaOH. Homogenized liquid mycelial cultures (8.4mL) were added into the experimental flask and mixed together with the substrates using a glass rod. All flasks were incubated in a cultivation cabinet at 30°C. The fungus-treated cornstalks were collected for cellulase activity analysis after a given cultivation time (4, 5, 6, 7 and 8days)."
4,Hydrogen fermentation,"2.3 Hydrogen fermentation The above fungus-pretreated cornstalk together with the raw cornstalk was used for hydrogen fermentation. Hydrogen fermentation experiments were carried out under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. The thermophilic inoculum was collected from a 5L anaerobic digester with 4L working volume. The thermophilic anaerobic digestion was started by using sewage sludge from a local winery as the seed sludge and operated at 55°C for more than 6months. The digester was fed twice a day with synthetic wastewater. Fresh synthetic wastewater (500mL) was added into the digester during each feeding process after the same volume fermentation liquid was removed from the digester. The composition of synthetic wastewater was as follows (g/L): glucose 2.720, peptone 0.800, meat extract 0.560, NaHCO3 2.000, CaCl2, 0.028, KH2PO4 0.060, NH4Cl 0.320, MgSO4·7H2O 0.042 and FeSO4·7H2O 0.032. The above sludge has 24,000mg/L total suspended solids (TSS) and 12,000mg/L volatile suspended solids (VSS). The sludge was heat shocked at 100°C for 30min to inactivate the methanogens and then used as the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation inoculum [19]. The anaerobic mesophilic sludge collected from Gaobeidian Wastewater Treatment Plant of Beijing has 24,000mg/L TSS and 13,000mg/L VSS. The mesophilic sludge was heat shocked at 100°C for 30min and used as the mesophilic hydrogen fermentation inoculum [20]. A 500mL glass serum bottle contained 4g blended cornstalk (mixture of raw cornstalk with fungus-pretreated cornstalk), 75mL thermophilic or mesophilic sludge inoculum, 195mL distilled water and 30mL minimal nutrient solution. The composition of the minimal nutrient solution was as follows (g/L): NH4HCO3 16.7, KH2PO4 8.3, MgSO4·7H2O 0.83, NaCl 0.08, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.08, CaCl2·2H2O 0.08, MnSO4·7H2O 0.13, and FeCl2 0.02. All glass serum bottles in batch experiments were flushed with N2 gas for 5min, sealed with butyl rubber stopper, and incubated in an incubator at 55°C or 35°C. Triplicate bottles were used in all experiments, and all values were the means calculated in triplicate ±SD."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis The fermented mixtures were collected at a given time and centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10min. The supernatant was used for the analysis of volatile fat acids (VFAs), and the solid residue was dried at 60°C for 24h for cellulosic component analysis. The concentrations of VFAs and alcohol in the fermentation broth were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC 4890N, Agilent Inc., USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30m×0.25mm×0.25μm fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP). The temperatures of the injector and detector were set at 250°C and 300°C, respectively. The oven temperature was initially kept at 70°C for 3min, followed by a ramp-up of 20°C/min for 5.5min and held at a final temperature of 180°C for 3min. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 2.6mL/min. The contents of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were measured gravimetrically using the method described by Goering and Van Soest [21]. TSS and VSS were measured using the standard method [22]. Weight loss was defined as the decrease ratio of solid dry weight during fermentation. One gram fungus-pretreated dried cornstalk was suspended in 20mL distilled water and kept at 40°C for 1h. The solid–liquid mixture was centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10min, and the supernatant was collected for determining cellulase activity of the fungus-pretreated cornstalk. The hydrogen fermentation broth was centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10min, and the supernatants were used for determination of cellulase activity. Filter paper activity (FPA) of the liquid sample was measured using the method described by Miller and Ghose [23,24]. One unit of FPA was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1μmol of glucose equivalent per min during the hydrolysis reaction [24]. After membrane (pore size 0.45μm) filtration, the fragmented low-molecular weight lignin in fermentation broth was quantified by UV spectroscopy at 280nm [25]. The gas components were measured using SP 4320 gas chromatography (Beijing analytical apparatus company, China) fitted with a thermal conductivity detector. The GC was equipped with 2 columns separated by a switching valve. Two stainless-steel columns were packed with molecular sieve 5A and Porapak Q (80/100 mesh), respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 12mL/min. The temperatures of the column oven, injector and detector were set at 70°C, 150°C and 250°C, respectively. Two-point calibrations were performed for all gases to ensure the accuracy of the measurements. The volume of hydrogen produced in the glass serum bottle was measured using a syringe, and the cumulative hydrogen volume per glass serum bottle was calculated by multiplying hydrogen content by gas volume [26]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Comparison of mesophilic and thermophilic hydrogen fermentation of the mixed cornstalk,"3.1 Comparison of mesophilic and thermophilic hydrogen fermentation of the mixed cornstalk The cumulative hydrogen volume was higher in both mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation of the mixed cornstalk than that in the fermentation of raw cornstalk (Fig. 1 ). The cumulative hydrogen volume produced in the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation was significantly higher than that in the mesophilic hydrogen fermentation because the optimal temperature of hydrogenase of the hydrogen-producing microorganisms for the reversible conversion of protons to molecular hydrogen was in the range from 50 to 70°C [27]. As shown in Fig. 2 , significantly high cellulase activity was observed in the hydrogen fermentation of the mixed cornstalk which contained a great amount of cellulase (5.8IU/g-fungus-pretreated cornstalk). The cellulase activity in the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation was higher than that in the mesophilic hydrogen fermentation because the cellulase exhibited optimal hydrolysis activity in the high temperature. High cellulase activity in the hydrogen fermentation efficiently hydrolyzed lignocellulose. When the mixed cornstalk was fermented, the weight loss of 38.0% after the thermophilic fermentation was higher than that of 30.2% after the mesophilic fermentation (Table 1 ). Correspondingly, hemicellulose and cellulose decreased more significantly in the thermophilic fermentation compared with that in the mesophilic fermentation. Similar results were also reported in previous studies on the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation of various substrates [10,28]. The major VFAs detected in the hydrogen fermentation process were acetate and butyrate, and a small amount of propionate and ethanol were observed (Fig. 3 ). Both lactate and valerate concentrations were too low to be detected. These data revealed that the present hydrogen production process was a butyrate fermentation type [29]. The maximum acetate and butyrate concentrations reached 620.0mg/L and 423.0mg/L respectively under the thermophilic fermentation conditions (Fig. 3B), which were higher than those (581.2mg/L acetate of and 291.0mg/L of butyrate) under the mesophilic fermentation conditions (Fig. 3A). When the mixed cornstalk was used for hydrogen fermentation, VFAs synthesis was enhanced under mesophilic as well as thermophilic fermentation (Fig. 3). The accumulated level of VFAs in the hydrogen fermentation broth correlated well with the cumulative hydrogen volume produced."
8,Effect of fungal fermentation time on hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation,"3.2 Effect of fungal fermentation time on hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation In order to produce enough cellulase in the fungal treatment process, the raw cornstalk was treated by T. reesei Rut C-30 for a given time. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the cellulase activity increase from 5.2IU/g to 7.2IU/g with increasing fermentation time from day 4 to day 6 and decreased after 6days. Similar results were also observed in reported studies [30–32]. The decrease of cellulase activity might be due to slight degradation of cellulase by protease. As a result, the cumulative hydrogen volume in the thermophilic fermentation of the mixed cornstalk increased from 157.2mL to 176.8mL when the fungal pretreatment time increased from day 4 to day 6 (Fig. 4B). The cumulative hydrogen volume produced from the mixed cornstalks correlated with the amount and activity of cellulase existed in the fungus-pretreated cornstalk. The higher cellulase activity hydrolyzed more lignocellulosic components into soluble substances suitable for hydrogen fermentation. The highest weight loss after the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation was observed from the raw cornstalk mixed with the 6-days fungus-treated cornstalk among the fungal treatment time experiments tested. The weight loss (Table 1) of the mixed cornstalk after the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation correlated with the cellulase activity (Fig. 4) existed in the fungus-treated cornstalk."
9,Effect of blending ratio on hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation,"3.3 Effect of blending ratio on hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation The effect of blending ratio of the 6-days fungus-pretreated cornstalk to the raw cornstalk on hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation was conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . The cumulative hydrogen volume increased gradually with increasing the blending ratio from 1:9 to 1:5 because the more fungus-pretreated cornstalk brought more cellulase into the hydrogen fermentation broth. The highest cumulative hydrogen volume from the mixed cornstalk reached 194.9mL when the blending ratio of the 6-day fungus-pretreated cornstalk to the raw cornstalk was 1:5. In the fungal pretreatment process, some cellulosic components in the fungus-pretreated cornstalk were utilized by T. reesei Rut C-30 for cell growth and cellulase production. When over amount of the fungus-pretreated cornstalk was mixed with the raw cornstalk, the available substrate of the mixed cornstalk for hydrogen fermentation decreased. As a result, the cumulative hydrogen volume from the mixed cornstalk decreased to 176.8mL and 150.4mL when the blending ratios of the fungus-pretreated cornstalk to the raw cornstalk were 1:3 and 1:1, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the highest weight loss of 41.6% was obtained via thermophilic fermentation of the mixed cornstalk at an optimal blending ratio 1:5. Correspondingly, cellulose and hemicellulose in the mixed cornstalk after the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation decreased to 24.3% and 22.3%, respectively. As shown in Table 2 , the hydrogen yield of 48.7mL/g-cornstalk (i.e. 54.1mL/gVS) obtained by the fungal pretreatment process was comparable with those reported data obtained in hydrogen fermentation from stalk waste pretreated by steam explosion, acidification, alkaline hydrolysis and microwave irradiation [8,13,17,33,34]. In comparison with the thermal–chemical pretreatment and steam explosion, the fungal pretreatment was considered as an energy-saving and environmentally-friendly method that might offer a promising alternative for the enhancement of bioconversion efficiency of lignocellulosic waste [35]. In addition, process scale-up of the present fungal pretreatment with solid state fermentation is relatively easy because of less water consumption, low energy input and cheap equipment cost [36–39]. Cornstalk has been widely used for production of syngas, heat, electricity and bio-oil etc. by combustion, gasification and pyrolysis technologies [40,41]. In addition, cornstalk can also be converted into renewable bioenergy products such as ethanol, biogas by using industrial microbial fermentation [1,4,42]. When compared to ethanol fermentation, anaerobic digestion for biogas production obtained broad industrial application due to low cost, simple operation and wide variety of usable forms of biogas [43]. Together with these mature technologies from large-scale anaerobic digestion of cornstalk for biogas production [5,42,43], hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation integrated with the fungal pretreatment process will provide a promising alternative for the enhancement of bioconversion efficiency of lignocellulosic waste biomass to hydrogen, an ideal energy carrier due to its high energy density by mass and clean combustion characteristics."
10,Conclusion,A simple and practical fungal pretreatment process was proven to be effective for improving hydrogen production via thermophilic fermentation of cornstalk waste. The highest cumulative hydrogen volume from the mixed cornstalk reached 194.9mL when the blending ratio of the 6-day fungus-pretreated cornstalk to the raw cornstalk was 1:5. The enhancement of hydrogen production was related to more cellulase produced by T. reesei Rut C-30 that enhanced hydrolysis of cellulosic components in the hydrogen fermentation broth and produced more soluble substances available to hydrogen-producing microorganisms.
