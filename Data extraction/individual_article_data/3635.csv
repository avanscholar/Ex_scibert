0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been used as a clean, renewable and efficient energy source, which is considered as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels in various applications, such as power generation, chemical industry and medical treatment [1–5]. With more applications of hydrogen discovered, it is vital to handle hydrogen gas during its production, transport, storage, and use, because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless but owning a high diffusion coefficient, low ignition energy, and wide explosion concentration range (4−75 vol%) [6]. Effective and practical detection of the hydrogen gas trace has attached more and more attention in recent years. A wide range of technologies has been applied to detect hydrogen gas, including gas sensors, gas chromatography, thermal conductivity, mass spectrometry, scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy [7–12]. Among them, metal oxide semiconductor hydrogen sensors have been intensively investigated for their advantages of low cost, fast response, high sensitivity and reliability, and reliable fabrication processes [13–15]. Many metal oxides have been used for hydrogen sensings, such as WO3, ZnO, TiO2, NiO, and ZnO [16–20]. However, these gas sensors need to be heated by a hot plate up to 100−400 °C to obtain a good sensor response. Considering the explosiveness of hydrogen gas, the detection under room temperature without heating is necessary and demanded based on the safety requirement. The mixed metal oxides have been investigated extensively to improve properties of the materials. For example, the metal nanoparticles-loaded metal oxides exhibit favorable performance in many areas, including sening, catalysis and optical devices [21–27]. Also, the binary metal-oxide composites have been adopted for hydrogen sensing, and represent a promising direction to enhance the sensor selectivity and sensitivity [28]. The heterojunction effect formed in the composite metal oxides is often used in gas sensors to improve the sensing performance because of their small dimensions and high surface-to-volume ratios [29]. Among the common metal oxide semiconductors, TiO2 has been proven to be a promising sensing material with good chemical stability [30]; and WO3 has been used extensively in hydrogen sensing due to the high sensitivity to hydrogen, resulting from its gas chromic properties and unique morphological structure [31,32]. Till now, WO3-TiO2 composite has been used as a catalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis [33,34]. However, a WO3-TiO2-based hydrogen gas sensor under room temperature is lack of report. Thus, in this study, a novel WO3-TiO2 sensing material was used to make a hydrogen sensor under room temperature. Key sensing parameters such as the sensing response, sensor response time, selectivity, and measuring rage were evaluated. The sensing mechanism was also discussed in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials synthesis,"2.1 Materials synthesis WO3-TiO2 composite materials were fabricated using the sol-gel process. 1.6 g P123 (PEO-PPO-PEO) (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved into 30 mL of ethanol (C2H5OH) (PTM) and stirred for 1 h; subsequently, 2.3 mL of acetic acid (CH3COOH) (J.T Baker), 0.74 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl) (J.T Baker), and 3.5 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (C16H36O4Ti) (Fluka) were added thereto while stirring, and then the mixture was stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, different quantities of tungstic acid (H2WO4) powder (Sigma Aldrich) were added to obtain various weight ratios of WO3: TiO2 as 2.0 %, 4.0 %, 12.0 %, and 20.0 % with stirring for 1 h. Then the solution was stirred for 12 h at 40 °C to evaporate C2H5OH slowly. The obtained precipitate was moved to an oven and dried at 65 °C for 24 h and then calcined at 450 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. At the same time, pure TiO2 was prepared using the solution without the addition of H2WO4, and the pure WO3 was obtained from H2WO4. The prepared pure WO3, TiO2, and WO3-TiO2 composite materials were each uniformly mixed with 10 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a paste. The sensing film was fabricated by dip-coating it on a cleaned alumina substrate (10 mm × 5 mm) containing a pair of comb-like gold electrodes (Fig.1 (a)). The coated substrate was dried at 70 °C and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to ensure good ohmic contacts between thin films. (The rate is 1.5 °C/min)."
3,Composite material characterization,"2.2 Composite material characterization The characterization of the crystal structure of WO3-TiO2 composite material was conducted through X-ray diffraction (XRD) [Shimadzu XRD 6000, Cu X-ray tube (Cu Kα 1 = 0.15405 nm)]. The particle planes were characterized through XRD at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 30 mA, with the 2θ scanning range of 20°-80° at a scanning rate of 2°/min. The composition of the proposed sample was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVACPHI, PHI 5000 VersaProbe). The microstructural characteristics and chemical composition of the composite materials were investigated through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (JEOL JEM-2100 F FE-TEM). The surface area was calculated using a multipoint Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) model."
4,Study of sensor properties,"2.3 Study of sensor properties Fig. 1 (a) shows the prepared sensor; the hydrogen sensing mechanism is based on the gas adsorption and desorption processes occurring on the surface of the sensing material. The hydrogen detection system conducted in a homemade measurement chamber is displayed in Fig.1 (b). The fabricated sensor was placed in the closed chamber at a suitable temperature (25 ± 2 °C) and optimum relative humidity (RH) (60 % ± 5 %). During the measurements, a 100 mL/min hydrogen gas flow through the measurement chamber was maintained by using mass flow controllers, and a known quantity of hydrogen gas (diluted with air) was injected into the measurement chamber until the response stage reached an equilibrium. For the measurement of the recovery process, the air was introduced into the measurement chamber to sweep the hydrogen gas. The resistance variation of the fabricated sensor was monitored using a simple circuit with a computer for data collection and processing. A Jiehan 5000 data acquisition system was used to perform all the resistance measurements by repeating the test several times, and the input voltage was set to 2 V. The sensor response (S) was defined as S = Rgas /Rair (Rair is the resistance in ambient air and Rgas is the resistance in a mixture of hydrogen and air). The response time (T90 ) is defined as the time required to obtain a result equal to 90 % of the equilibrium signal. The recovery time (Tr90 ) is the time required to bring the signal back to 90 % of the background signal. RH in the sensing chamber was typically maintained at 60 ± 5 %, and it varied as 40 ± 5 %, 60 ± 5 %, and 80 ± 5 % to test the humidity effect on the proposed sensor. Besides, to investigate the sensor response of the fabricated sensor, carbon monoxide (CO), ethanol (C2H5OH), acetone (CH3COCH3), and formaldehyde (HCHO) were used as target gases with the same sensing process as the hydrogen gas condition under room temperature. Among them, the HCHO gas sample was prepared from the HCHO solution, and the preparation process has been introduced in our previous study [35]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of (a) TiO2, (b) WO3, (c) 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2, (d) 12.0 wt% WO3-TiO2, and (e) 20.0 wt% WO3-TiO2, respectively. The peaks corresponding to (101), (103) and (220) crystal planes are the main characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2, and the (110) crystal plane represents the rutile TiO2 (Fig.2 (a)). In Fig. 2 (b), three distinctive peaks at 2θ of 22.6 ̊, 23.12 ̊, and 23.86 ̊ are assigned to the (002), (020), and (200) crystal planes of monoclinic-phase WO3, respectively. The other crystal planes are also marked. The patterns of 4.0, 12.0, and 20.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 retain the characteristic peaks of TiO2 and those of WO3. The results indicate the successful fabrication of the WO3-TiO2 composite. Also, the average crystallite size (D) of the fabricated samples is calculated by Scherrer equation: D = 0.9 λ / β c o s ( θ ) where, λ = 0.154 nm is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and θ is the Bragg’s diffraction angle. The calculated results of the TiO2 (101) and WO3 (200) crystalline sizes are about 15.0 nm and 32.0 nm, respectively. The obtained crystallite sizes of the fabricated WO3-TiO2 composites (plane (101)) are about 10.9 nm, 10.4 nm and 9.9 nm with weight ratio of 4.0, 12.0 and 20.0 wt%, respectively. The result indicates a small decrease of the crystallite sizes with the increase of the WO3 amount. The elemental composition of the synthesized pure TiO2 and 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 were elucidated using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . Only Ti and O elements were detected from synthesized TiO2 (Fig. 3 (a)), and W, Ti and O were observed in Fig. 3(b) for 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 (Cu and C were derived from the Cu 200 mesh grid used as a support). These results reveal that the obtained TiO2 and WO3-TiO2 composite do not contain other impurities. Combining with the aforementioned XRD results, the successful synthesis of high-purity WO3-TiO2 can be confirmed. The element composition of the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 sample was analyzed using XPS. The Ti 2p, O 1s, and W 2f XPS spectra are displayed in Fig. 4 (a), (b), and (c), respectively. Fig. 4 (a) exhibits that the binding energy at 458.0 eV and 464.0 eV was attributed to the Ti 2p2/3 and Ti 2p1/2 energy levels [36]. The difference between the two energy levels suggests the Ti 4+ form of Ti element existing in TiO2 [37]. Fig. 4 (b) shows the O 1s spectrum of 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 sample. The binding energy at 529.0 eV was attributed to the O-Ti-O band, and the binding energy at 530.0 eV corresponded to the lattice oxygen of Ti4+-O or W6+-O, indicating that WO and Ti-O shared the orbital O 1s in W-O-Ti bond [38]. The XPS spectrum of the W 4f (Fig. 4 (c)) shows that W element had been doped into TiO2 during the formation of WO3-TiO2 composite [39].The binding energies of 36.3 eV and 37.1 eV corresponded to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, which were shifted from 36.1 and 37.0 eV for pure WO3, respectively [40]. The binding energy change of O 1s and W 4f indicates the change of the electron density on the surface of TiO2 and WO3, suggesting the electron transfer occurred in 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 sample [41,42]. Therefore, the formation of WO3-TiO2 heterojunction was further proved. TEM was employed to exam the structure of the synthesized pure TiO2 and the WO3-TiO2 composites, and the results are displayed in Fig. 5 . There are many small particles of TiO2 stacked with two kinds of holes (Fig. 5 (a)): the large holes left by the evaporation of P123 after calcination, and the small pores from TiO2 stacking produced by self-assembly. The TEM images of WO3-TiO2 composites with different proportions of WO3 (4.0, 12.0, 20.0 wt%) are shown in Fig. 5 (b) to (d). Fig. 5 (b) shows that the structure of 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 can retain the pores left with the removal of P123. However, as the proportion of WO3 increased, the particles agglomerated. In particular, when the proportion of WO3 was 20.0 wt%, severe agglomeration occurred, and the small pores in the composite material almost disappeared, as revealed in Fig. 5 (d). The composite materials were subjected to the BET test, and the results are listed in Table 1 . The specific surface area of TiO2, 2.0 wt% WO3-TiO2, 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2, 12.0 wt% WO3-TiO2, 20.0 wt% WO3- TiO2 were 84.8, 78.84, 109.8, 76.5, 69.6 m2/g, respectively. The 4.0 % WO3-TiO2 presented a higher specific surface area than that of pure TiO2 and other composites. The specific surface area decreased with the increase of WO3 content, from 109.8 m2/g of 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 to 69.6 m2/g of 20.0 wt% WO3-TiO2. The reason for this phenomenon is that when the content of WO3 in the composite material increased, the composite structure collapsed during the calcination causing the particles to aggregate, and indirectly blocked the pores of WO3-TiO2, leading to the reduction of the surface area. The BET test results are consistent with the TEM images: 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 composite processes the largest surface area with the most porous structure."
7,"Gas sensing performance of TiO2, WO3, and WO3-TiO2 composite","3.2 Gas sensing performance of TiO2, WO3, and WO3-TiO2 composite Fig. 6 (a) and (b) depict the plots of the sensor resistance of the synthesized TiO2 and WO3 versus time for 10,000 ppm H2 at room temperature, respectively. It is revealed that the synthesized TiO2 is a p-type semiconductor, whereas the WO3 is an n-type semiconductor. And an electrical aging phenomenon is observed for the pure TiO2 and WO3 sensing materials, which is that the resistance of the sensing element cannot be smoothly restored to the base resistance (Rair). The repeated resistance signal curves of the TiO2-based sensor and WO3-TiO2 -based sensors with various WO3 proportions are presented in Fig. 7 . The fabricated-WO3-TiO2-based hydrogen sensors were p-type semiconductor-based sensors and presented faster response and recovery than the TiO2-based sensor. As the proportion of WO3 in the WO3-TiO2 composites increased, the Rair decreased. The 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 showed promising sensitivity with high response. It should be noted that there is no electrical aging effect that occurred with TiO2- and WO3-based sensors for the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor, indicating the excellent repeatability and stability of 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2. The exact response time, recovery time, sensor response, and base resistance results are summarized in Table 2 . The sensors using WO3-TiO2 composites as the sensing element had a shorter response and recovery time than either TiO2 or WO3. Especially for the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor, the T90 and Tr90 were only 48 s and 5 s. Also, the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor possessed the best sensor response (S = 5.62), which was about 3 times of that for synthesized TiO2-sensor (S = 1.86), and about 3.7 times of that for synthesized WO3-sensor (S = 1.50). These hydrogen sensing performances echo the results obtained by BET analysis; it is estimated that 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 has the highest surface area, easy to catch the hydrogen gas and increase the amount of hydrogen adsorbed, leading to the fast response and high sensitivity. Besides, the Rair of the WO3-TiO2-composite-based hydrogen sensors decreased from 14.8 MΩ for 2.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 to 4.05 MΩ for 20.0 wt% WO3-TiO2. These lower Rair compared with that of the synthesized TiO2- and WO3-based sensor is due to the heterojunction effect of the WO3-TiO2 composite. When the sensing element material has a heterojunction effect, the electron migration efficiency can be effectively improved. However, the sensors using 12.0 and 20.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 with lower Rair due to more notable heterojunction effect performed neither faster response and recovery nor higher response sensitivity than 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor. It could be explained by the decrease in the specific surface area of the sensing materials. In summary, 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based hydrogen sensor presented good sensing performance with fast response (48 s) and recovery (5 s), and high response sensitivity 5.62 due to a high specific surface area and low Rair , benefiting from the porous structure and heterojunction effect. Table 3 lists the comparison of the sensing characteristics of different hydrogen sensors operating under room temperature. It is clear that the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor in this work shows competitive performance in H2 gas sensing as regarding the sensor response, response time and recovery time (Fig. 8 ). The responses of the proposed sensor at a hydrogen concentration of 1,000–10,000 ppm were investigated to study the influence of the hydrogen concentration on the sensitivity at room temperature; the results are displayed in Fig. 9 . The sensor response of 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor increased linearly with the increase of hydrogen concentration, with favorable linearity of 0.9917, confirming that 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 can be used as a hydrogen sensing material. Table 4 shows the effect of the humidity on the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based hydrogen sensor under room temperature. The sensor responses were measured as 7.18, 5.62 and 2.59 at RHs of 40 ± 5 %, 60 ± 5 %, and 80 ± 5 %, respectively. The response and recovery time extended with the increase of the RH, indicating the negative effect of humidity on the sensor response. It could be explained by that the moisture is absorbed on the surface of the porous structure, reducing the contact of oxygen and hydrogen with the sensing material. In practice, selectivity is a key parameter for gas sensors. Gas interference tests were performed at RH = 60 % ± 5 % with hydrogen and other gases to evaluate the selectivity of the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor. As illustrated in Fig. 10 , the obtained sensor exhibited a remarkable selectivity toward hydrogen with a limited response to the interfering gases, including 1000 ppm CO, 10 ppm HCHO, 1000 ppm C2H5OH, and 1000 ppm CH3COCH3. The sensor response of other gases is between 1.08 ∼ 1.13, and the sensing signal is quite insignificant. This result reveals that the proposed sensor possesses excellent selectivity toward hydrogen gas under room temperature. Furthermore, the stability test for 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor for 10,000 ppm H2 was performed at room temperature with RH 60 % (Fig. 11 ) for 15 days. The sensor response was maintained between 4 and 5 without significant degradation, indicating the high reproducibility of the proposed sensor. This results clearly demonstrates that the WO3-TiO2-based sensor can be employed in actual sites for the hydrogen detection with consistent sensing performance."
8,Sensing mechanism,"3.3 Sensing mechanism The hydrogen sensing mechanism is based on the gas adsorption and desorption processes occurring on the material surface. At a normal atmospheric condition, there would be different changing states of oxygen adsorption according to the operating temperatures [47]. When the WO3-TiO2 composite-based sensor is exposed to air, oxygen molecules are adsorbed by the surface [Eq. (1)]. And they combine with the electrons on the surface from the conductance band of WO3-TiO2 composite to produce chemisorbed oxygen (O2 −) when the operating temperature is below 100 °C [Eq. (2)]. Then, the introduced hydrogen gas reacts with the chemisorbed oxygen ion (O2 −) and formed of H2O molecules with releasing the electrons back to the conduction band [Eq. (3)], which causes changes in the resistance of the sensing material. The 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 composite has a high specific surface area benefiting from the mesoporous structure; therefore, much more oxygen is adsorbed to produce O2-, not only on the surface but also inside the material, as shown in Fig. 12 (a). As a result, the sensing performance of the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based sensor is more effectively improved. (1) O2 (gas) →O2 (ads) (2) O2(ads) + e− → O2 − (ads) (T＜100 °C) (3) 2H2 + O2 − → 2H2O + e− The benefit of the fabricated 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 composite is not only the large specific surface area but also the p-n heterojunction formed by decorating the p-type TiO2 with n-type WO3 (Fig. 12(b)) [37,38]. The heterojunction may improve the electron mobility and enhance the electronic interaction (Eq. (2) and Eq.(3)), resulting in a response elevation. Therefore, the WO3-TiO2 composite exhibits a higher response than WO3 or TiO2 alone."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, the WO3-TiO2 composite was fabricated for hydrogen sensing and was characterized using XRD, EDS, XPS, BET and TEM. A mesoporous WO3-TiO2 heterojunction (WO3: 4.0 wt%) was obtained with a high surface area of 109.8 m2/g. The 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2-based hydrogen sensor exhibited favorable hydrogen sensing properties such as high selectivity, fast response and recovery, good stability, repeatability, and a high response (S = 5.62) under room temperature. Furthermore, the hydrogen sensing mechanism of the WO3-TiO2-based sensor was proposed. Promising sense performance under low operating temperature makes the 4.0 wt% WO3-TiO2 an excellent candidate for hydrogen sensing in practical applications."
