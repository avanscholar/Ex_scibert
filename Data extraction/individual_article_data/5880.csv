0,Introduction,"The chemical industry needs to consider alternative, renewable sources to reduce both dependency on oil reserves and to decrease carbon dioxide emission into the environment (Ragauskas et al., 2006). Biomass is an important resource for the production of industrial bulk chemicals. Among the variety of biomass resources, organic waste streams are the most interesting ones because they are abundantly available, cheap and they do not compete with food (Tilman et al., 2009). Organic wastes can be biologically converted into carboxylates, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate under anaerobic conditions without need of costly sterilization operations as in pure culture fermentations. Organic waste materials generally contain a mixture of carbohydrate, protein and lipid polymers. Because of this complexity, organic wastes can only be transformed into the desired products by using a mixed culture. The first step in a mixed culture anaerobic process of organic wastes is hydrolysis of carbohydrates to monosaccharides, proteins to amino acids and lipids to glycerol and long chain fatty acids. After hydrolysis, these monomers are converted to carboxylates, hydrogen and carbon dioxide during acidogenesis (De Mes et al., 2003). Carboxylates are individually valuable products and they can be used in industry after separation from the fermentation broth and further purification. Carboxylates can however also be used in a secondary fermentation step to generate biofuels and poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates (Agler et al., 2011; Albuquerque et al., 2011; Holtzapple and Granda, 2009). Because of the diverse polymer composition of organic waste materials and the use of mixed cultures, anaerobic processes generate a mixture of various compounds rather than one single product. Furthermore, because of a high water content of the waste source, the final products are generated in diluted concentrations. Under these conditions, downstream processing of carboxylates requires a considerable amount of energy that negatively affects the production costs of the desired products. As a result, current biological production from waste materials cannot yet compete with chemical production from fossil oil in the market. Processes, which produce chemicals from organic waste materials, can only become competitive with production from fossil sources if the process can generate a single chemical and in a high concentration. Up to now, many studies have been applying fermentation with different organic waste streams, such as artificial food waste (Komemoto et al., 2009), manure (Coats et al., 2011), dairy wastewater (Bengtsson et al., 2008), paper waste (Ueno et al.,2007), organic fraction of municipal solid waste (Cavdar et al., 2011). These tests were conducted under various operational conditions, such as pH, temperature and organic load in continuous or batch-wise mode. Among the parameters which have been studied up to today, the effect of headspace composition on selective production of one carboxylate in high concentrations was not systematically investigated, while we have indications that certain fermentation pathways can be energetically suppressed or favored by hydrogen and carbon dioxide levels in the headspace (Thauer et al., 1977). Indeed, some studies investigated the effect of headspace, particularly hydrogen partial pressure, on anaerobic process, but these studies only focused on biological hydrogen production (Zhang et al., 2011; Kraemer and Bagley, 2007). To the best of our knowledge the effect of hydrogen and carbon dioxide on carboxylate formation has not been investigated yet. In this study, the objective was to direct mixed culture fermentation of organic waste towards a single product in sufficiently high concentrations by manipulating the headspace. This study aimed to reach a production of one major compound making up more than 50% of the total products. To this end, carboxylate production from three organic waste streams of different polymeric compositions, was monitored in terms of total fermentation product concentration as well as relative composition after supplying 2bar hydrogen and carbon dioxide or a mixture of these two gases to the headspace."
1,Methods,
2,Inocula and waste streams,"2.1 Inocula and waste streams Granular sludge from an anaerobic digester of the potato processing industry was selected as inoculum (Opure, Ede, The Netherlands). The granular sludge was washed with 20mM potassium phosphate buffer (at pH 5) and sieved with a mesh of 500μm for three times. After the last washing step, the granules were left in the same buffer solution overnight at room temperature. The next day, the granular sludge, with a 9% dry matter content and 11% ash content, was heat treated by boiling in water for 15min to avoid methanogenesis. As carbon source, instead of pure polymers, real organic waste streams from industry were used. Organic waste streams were collected from potato, meat and oil processing companies."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up PVC water-jacketed reactors (5L) were filled with 750ml basal medium. The basal medium was prepared according to Phillips et al. (1993) without sulfate to prevent sulfate reduction. Ammonium concentration in the medium was adjusted according to the carbon source used to keep the carbon to nitrogen ratio at 10. The pH of the medium was set to 5.0 using 4mM monopotassium phosphate and 4mM dipotassium phosphate buffers without changing the total phosphorus concentration in the medium. After substrate addition to a concentration of 8g COD/l, each reactor was inoculated with 8g of pre-treated granular sludge (wet weight). Then, the pH was corrected to 5.0 with 2M NaOH or HCl. The experiment with meat processing waste was controlled with 2M NaOH and HCl at pH 5 throughout the experiment to avoid pH increase by ammonia release from proteins. All reactors were adjusted to a final headspace pressure of 2bar by adding hydrogen, carbon dioxide or a 50:50 (v:v) mixture of these two gases. Pressure of the headspace of each reactor was monitored on-line with a manometer. During the experiment, pressure drops were noted in the reactors with mixed hydrogen and carbon dioxide headspace. In such case, headspace pressure was readjusted to 2bar by adding an appropriate amount of 50:50 (v:v) hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixture. A control reactor was prepared under the same conditions, but was flushed with nitrogen at the start of the experiment and left under atmospheric pressure. All reactors were kept at 30°C by hot water circulation and mixed at 100rpm by a magnetic drive stirrer. The incubation period was 30days. Gas and liquid samples were taken weekly. The headspace to liquid sampling ratio was chosen such that no underpressure was caused until the end of the experiment."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis The headspace was sampled through a rubber septum using a gas-tight plastic syringe and analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Trace GC Ultra) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). H2 content was analyzed with a 2m stainless steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A (80/100 mesh) using nitrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20ml/min. Methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen were analyzed with a 2m stainless steel HayeSepQ (80/100mesh) and molecular sieve 5A (80/100mesh) column connected in series with a valve. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 15ml/min. Before being analyzed liquid samples were centrifuged for 5min at 10000rpm to remove particles. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) samples were acidified with 1:1 (v/v) H2SO4 solution and then extracted with diethyl ether. VFAs were analyzed in a GC (CE Instruments-Thermoquest) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 15m AT-1000 filled capillary column (0.53mm×1.2μm). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 6ml/min. Acetone, ethanol and propanol were analyzed in the headspace of the samples at 60°C with the same GC fitted in split mode with a split/splitless injector and AT-WAX capillary column (60m×0.32mm×1.00μm). Carrier gas was helium with a gas flow rate of 1.6ml/min. Lactate was analyzed with a GC (Interscience, CE Instruments-Trace GC) equipped with FID detector in split mode with split/splitless injector and AT-1 capillary column (30m×0.53mm×5μm column). Each sample was treated with Ce(SO4)2 and kept at 60°C for 10min to convert lactic acid into acetaldehyde which was then analyzed in the headspace. Each waste was analyzed with the Phenol–sulfuric method (Dubois et al., 1956) for its glucose content, the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method with conversion factor of 6.25 (Pierce and Haenisch, 1948) for its protein content; and the Soxhlet extraction method (Pomeranz and Meloan, 1994) for its lipid content. Total and volatile solid contents were analyzed as described in Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). Total Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODt) was determined with Dr. Hach Lange cuvette tests, soluble COD (CODs) and NH4–N concentrations of each sample were determined with Dr. Hach Lange cuvette tests after centrifugation."
5,Calculations,"2.4 Calculations Part of the initial CODt added to the reactor is converted to products. The remaining part of CODt either stays in the same form of the initially added COD or is liquefied. In a balanced system, the initial amount of CODt, added to a reactor at start-up, should be recovered in various forms at the end of the experiment. COD recovery of the system was calculated with (1) CODrecovery ( % ) = ( CODt _ final / CODt _ initial ) ∗ 100 where CODt_final and COD_initial is the sum of measured CODt in the liquid (with solid particles) and in the gas phase at the end and start of the experiment (g COD). The hydrolysis degree represents the portion of initially added solid particles transformed into a soluble form. The hydrolysis degree of the system was calculated with (2) Hydrolysis degree ( % ) = [ ( CODs _ final - CODs _ initial - ( | CODH 2 _ initial - CODH 2 _ final | ) ) / CODsolid _ initial ] ∗ 100 where CODs_final and CODs_initial is the measured CODs at the end and start of the experiment (g COD), CODH2_initial and CODH2_final is the measured COD of H2 at the start and at the end of the experiment (g COD) and CODsolid_initial is the difference between the measured values of CODt and CODs at the start of the experiment (g COD). The fraction of a single product produced in the system was calculated with (3) Fraction ( % ) = ( COD _ product / COD _ allproducts ) ∗ 100 where COD_product is the COD calculated from the measured concentration of the single product produced in the system (g COD) and COD_all products is the sum of all calculated product COD values in the system (g COD)."
6,Results and discussion,"The objective of this study was to direct mixed culture fermentation towards a single product in sufficiently high concentrations by supplying 2bar of 100% hydrogen, 100% carbon dioxide or a 50:50 (v:v) mixture of these gases in the headspace. These conditions were considered to represent an adequate range for studying the impact of headspace composition on the fermentation process and product composition. As a carbon source, three real organic waste streams different in carbohydrate, lipid and protein composition were selected to observe the individual effect of polymer compositions on product concentration and type. Each headspace composition was run with three different waste streams. The compositions of the three waste streams are presented in Table 1 . Conform expectation, the waste stream from the potato processing company was rich in carbohydrates, the one from the meat processing company in proteins and the one from the oil processing company in lipids. Therefore, they were considered suitable for the test purposes. They are denominated carbohydrate waste, protein waste and lipid waste from now on. A COD recovery close to 100% of a system shows a good balance of the process. In this study, the COD recoveries of the reactors were determined by Eq. (1). The COD recoveries for the carbohydrate waste experiment were between 90% and 106%. Fig. 1 illustrates the COD balance in the carbohydrate waste reactor with hydrogen headspace. COD recoveries for the protein waste experiment were between 80% and 115%. Only in the reactors with lipid waste, COD recoveries were lower than 85%. The low COD recovery in the lipid waste experiment is probably caused by the difficulties in handling the viscous waste and taking nonhomogenous samples, as well as poor hydrolysis of lipids during fermentation. For all conditions, carboxylate concentrations were higher than alcohol concentrations. Acetate, n-butyrate and propionate were the main carboxylates depending on the headspace composition and the substrate type. In few cases, the COD fraction of i-valerate and n-caproate was above 10% of the total COD of products. Since this study focuses on production of a single compound, products fractions lower than 10% will not be discussed further. In the experiments with the carbohydrate and protein wastes, lactate was completely consumed within a 1week incubation period. On the lipid waste, lactate was produced, but in negligible concentrations. Because the fractions of the products varied in time, the results are presented after 1week and 4weeks incubation periods. Methane was not detected in any of the experiments."
7,Effect of substrate on the anaerobic process in the control reactors,"3.1 Effect of substrate on the anaerobic process in the control reactors First, the effect of substrate on the fermentation product type and concentration was investigated. The highest total carboxylate production was obtained with the carbohydrate waste and amounted to 4.9g COD/l. For the protein waste, total carboxylate concentration was 2.0g COD/l and for the lipid waste only 0.1g COD/l. The relatively low carboxylate concentration in the lipid waste compared to other waste types is caused by the low hydrolysis constant for lipids compared to proteins and carbohydrates (Christ et al., 2000). Since hydrolysis is often the rate limiting step of the overall anaerobic process, poor hydrolysis rates yield low product concentrations (Mata-Alvarez et al., 2000). Fig. 2 shows the three major product concentrations of the control reactors in the carbohydrate, protein and lipid waste experiments. From the produced carboxylates, acetate was the major product for all the control reactors after 4weeks of incubation. However, the acetate concentrations and fractions varied with substrate type. The maximum acetate concentration was 2.2g COD/l at 43% of the total carboxylates on the carbohydrate waste. Although the concentration of acetate, 1.3g COD/l, on protein waste was lower than on carbohydrate waste, its relative fraction was higher reaching 67%. With the lipid waste, concentrations of acetate were lower than 80mg COD/l. The results show that although carbohydrate waste produced higher carboxylate concentrations compared to protein and lipid wastes, product formation was not oriented towards one major carboxylate under a regular headspace, while the protein and lipid waste generated mainly acetate. On the carbohydrate waste, the second major carboxylate was propionate. Propionate concentration reached 1.7g COD/l constituting a 33% fraction. Butyrate concentration was lower than propionate concentration and amounted to 0.9g COD/l constituting a 17% fraction. Propionate and butyrate concentrations obtained on the protein waste were negligible. The variable product formation on the carbohydrate waste and the single type of product formation on the protein waste might be caused by pH differences in these experiments. In the carbohydrate waste tests, the reactors were run without pH control and the pH dropped to 4.2 for the control reactor (Table 2 ). This shift in pH may have lead to variable products formation. In the test with the protein waste, the reactors were kept at pH 5.0 to avoid alcalinization because of ammonia release from proteins. Keeping the pH at a fixed value of 5.0 may have led to production of a single major carboxylate, namely acetate. It is worth to note here that without pH control in the reactors with the protein waste, a pH increase above 5.0 would probably have occurred leading to a similar kind of discussion. Some references indicate that the fermentation process is more directed to acetate production at pH higher than 5.0 and to butyrate production at pH lower than 5.0 (e.g. Fang et al., 2006) while others rather point to the opposite (e.g. Rodriguez et al., 2005). Still, it is difficult to draw a certain conclusion about the relationship between pH and product type from former studies. The reason is that these studies worked with different organic substrates with different inocula. Gas production was negligible in the control reactors. Therefore, the effect of produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide on the process can be accepted as being minor. Hydrogen production in the carbohydrate waste test was 28mg COD/l-headspace and in the protein waste test 8mg COD/l-headspace and production only occurred during the 1st week of incubation. After the 1st week, the produced hydrogen was completely consumed in both experiments. Carbon dioxide production continued until the end for both the carbohydrate and protein waste tests reaching approximately 4mM. Hydrogen was not produced at all during fermentation of the lipid waste and carbon dioxide production was only 1.5mM."
8,Effect of headspace composition on anaerobic processes,"3.2 Effect of headspace composition on anaerobic processes We can distinguish two effects of headspace composition on anaerobic processes: (i) the effect on the hydrolysis step and (ii) the effect on the acidogenesis step. The increase in concentration of fermentation products depends on the efficiency of hydrolysis and the type of products formed depends on the conditions of acidogenesis. Both effects will be discussed separately in the following sections. 3.2.1 Effects of headspace on hydrolysis Hydrolysis is the first step of the anaerobic digestion process and it is often considered as the rate limiting step of the anaerobic process (Mata-Alvarez et al., 2000). A high hydrolysis degree can therefore enhance the overall process and increase total carboxylate production. The hydrolysis rate has been described before as a function of factors such as pH, temperature, substrate type and loading, particle size of substrate and concentrations of intermediate products (Veeken and Hamelers, 1999). In this study, the effect of hydrogen, carbon dioxide or a mixture of these two gases on hydrolysis of the carbohydrate and the protein wastes was studied. The hydrolysis degree was calculated with Eq. (2). Since bottlenecks in the hydrolysis of lipids were discussed previously, the results with the lipid waste are not discussed further in this section. Hydrolysis degrees on the carbohydrate waste after 1week and 4weeks of incubation are presented in Table 2. The rates of hydrolysis degree were clearly lower in the reactors under a modified carbon dioxide headspace at 1week incubation. After 1week, the hydrolysis degrees on the carbohydrate waste were the lowest in the reactors with the mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide and only carbon dioxide. To the best of our knowledge, such an effect has never been described in literature before. A maximum hydrolysis degree of the carbohydrate waste was obtained in the reactor with hydrogen headspace at the end of the 4weeks incubation period. For the headspace conditions of the mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, only carbon dioxide headspace and the control reactor hydrolysis degrees reached similar values at the end of the experiment. Hydrogen or carbon dioxide had no effect on the hydrolysis degree of protein waste. In all reactors fed with the protein waste, the hydrolysis degrees were approximately 30% after 1week (data not shown). At the end of the experiment, the hydrolysis degrees increased slightly in all headspace conditions including the control reactor, to a maximum of 34% in the reactor with carbon dioxide headspace. 3.2.2 Effect of headspace composition on product type It was anticipated that product formation could be steered by manipulating hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the headspace and that the effect would be different for different substrate compositions. Addition of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to the headspace had a clear effect on the product type and concentration. Table 2 shows the total VFA and main carboxylate concentrations at each headspace condition for the carbohydrate waste. It is observed that in the reactors with hydrogen and carbon dioxide or a mixture of these gases supplied in the headspace, the total VFA concentration increase was higher than in the controls. Since the final hydrolysis degree was similar in all cases, the difference in total VFA production seems to indicate different fermentation kinetics with variable headspace compositions. For each substrate type, the total carboxylate concentration in the reactor with hydrogen plus carbon dioxide headspace was higher than in those with solely hydrogen or carbon dioxide or in the control. The highest carboxylate concentration increase was 18.8g COD/l and was obtained on protein waste (data not shown). For each substrate type, the main carboxylate in the reactors with 2bar hydrogen and carbon dioxide headspace was acetate. The highest acetate concentration was 17.4g COD/l with a 87% fraction obtained on the protein waste (Fig. 2). Acetate production in these specific reactors continued throughout the experiment and its concentration exceeded the CODt amount which was added initially as substrate. The additional acetate thus had to be produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide present in the headspace by homoacetogens (Eq. (1) in Table 3 ). The consumption of hydrogen and carbon dioxide from the headspace in these reactors also proves the homoacetogenic activity (Fig. 3 ). In the lipid waste experiment, headspace consumption was negligible (not shown). Homoacetogens produce acetate from hydrogen and carbon dioxide available in the gas phase (Drake et al., 2002). Acetate production with a mixed inoculum via the homoacetogenesis process has previously been shown by Nie et al. (2007). This case will thus not be discussed further. On carbohydrate waste both acetate and butyrate concentrations could be increased by supplying 2bar hydrogen to the headspace compared to the control reactor. However, selective production towards a single compound was not found under this headspace condition (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Butyrate and acetate reached similar concentrations under 2bar hydrogen during 1month of experiments for every tested waste type. The highest acetate concentration of 2.6g COD/l and the highest butyrate concentration of 3.1g COD/l were both obtained with the carbohydrate waste. Acetate concentrations in the experiments with carbohydrate and lipid waste were slightly higher than in the control reactors while the opposite was true for the protein waste (Fig. 2). Apparently, production of acetate from protein waste was not favorable under elevated hydrogen pressure in headspace. Here, it should be reminded again that only for the protein waste, the pH was controlled at 5.0. In fact, in the reactor with the hydrogen headspace, the butyrate concentration and fraction was higher than acetate after the 1st week of incubation on the carbohydrate waste (Table 2). After the 1st week, the acetate production rate apparently became faster than the butyrate production rate. Hydrogen consumption from the headspace started at the end of the 2nd week of incubation. From that point on, caproate production, albeit in negligible concentrations, continuously increased while acetate and butyrate concentrations were stable. The highest concentration and fraction of caproate was found under hydrogen modified headspace. In these reactors, hydrogen consumption was 0.5bar in the carbohydrate waste and 0.25bar in the protein waste experiment. Hydrogen consumption was not detected in the reactor with lipid waste. The presented results indicate that the final product type and concentrations were not only determined by either the effect of hydrogen and carbon dioxide added to the headspace or the effect of substrates, but also by the combined effect of headspace and polymer source in the substrate. For the reactors with the carbon dioxide headspace, our findings show that a carbon dioxide headspace favors the production of butyrate from the carbohydrate type of waste whereas acetate is the main product for the other two waste streams (Fig. 2). The highest butyrate concentration increase was 2.5g COD/l and it was three times higher than in the control reactor. In fact, it is important to note that while the butyrate concentration obtained in this reactor was in absolute terms lower than in the reactor with hydrogen headspace, a higher butyrate fraction of 47% was obtained under a carbon dioxide headspace. Carbon dioxide pressure in the headspace was stable during all experiments. For protein and lipid wastes, both acetate and butyrate concentrations were higher than in the control reactors (Fig. 2). However, concentration levels were quite low (<1.6g COD/l). The butyrate concentrations were higher under each modified headspace compared to the control reactor. Furthermore fractions reached above 70% in the reactors with carbon dioxide and with mixed hydrogen and carbon dioxide headspace after a 1week test period for the carbohydrate waste while it was only 17% in the control reactor. High butyrate concentrations relative to other fermentation products might be linked to the lactate consumed during the 1st week of the experiment. Several intermediate fermentation reactions such as lactate oxidation to butyrate (Eq. (2) in Table 3) or butyrate production via consumption of acetate and lactate (Eq. (3) in Table 3) were previously presented in Agler et al. (2011). However, in the reactors showing lactate consumption, the amount of butyrate produced exceeded the amount of lactate consumed. Hence, butyrate production cannot only be explained by oxidation of lactate. Similarly, the amounts of acetate and lactate consumed in the carbon dioxide headspace reactor did not correspond to Eq. (3) in Table 3. Because also no carbon dioxide consumption or production was observed in the headspace of the reactors, carbon dioxide must have affected the fermentation reaction mechanism in a different way. Previously, effects of carbon dioxide sparging on a continuous fermentation process fed with sucrose were studied by Kim et al. (2006). They reached a butyrate concentration of 8.2g COD/l with a fraction of 71% of total carboxylates produced in a reactor sparged with carbon dioxide compared to 6.1g COD/l with a fraction of 40% in a reactor sparged with nitrogen. According to Kim et al. (2006), a carbon dioxide partial pressure higher than 0.7bar decreases the biomass activity of acetogens which consume butyrate for acetate production (Eq. 4 in Table 3). This conclusion is consistent with the observation of Hansson and Molin (1981). Under 1bar of carbon dioxide partial pressure they found that degradation of butyrate to acetate by acetogens was slightly limited compared to 0.2bar. A possible reason of the carbon dioxide inhibition is the damage on the cell membrane and on cell division (Dixon and Kell, 1989). In our study, the effects of limitation on butyrate degradation to acetate might be even higher for the reactor with 2bar of carbon dioxide in the headspace. Because of the inhibition effect of carbon dioxide on acetogens, butyrate consumption is reduced and its proportion may become higher in the reactor with carbon dioxide headspace. From the findings it can be concluded that propionate production can be ceased by hydrogen or carbon dioxide (Table 2). The propionate concentration increase in the control reactor was 1.3g COD/l with a fraction of 33% on the carbohydrate waste while it remained in minor concentrations (<0.4g COD/l) in all other headspace manipulated conditions (Table 2). This is in contrast to our expectation that propionate production could be more favorable especially under 2bar of hydrogen since the reaction requires 2mol of hydrogen with 1mol of glucose (Eq. 5 in Table 3) (Angenent et al., 2004). Results obtained in this research showed that initial hydrogen partial pressure up to 2bar did not limit acetate and butyrate production reactions from the carbohydrate, protein and lipid rich substrates. This is in contradiction with the fact that hydrogen can thermodynamically limit fermentation reactions when it accumulates in the headspace (Rodriguez et al., 2005). In mixed cultures, syntrophic communities are required to avoid hydrogen partial pressure increase in the headspace and to allow continued production of acetate and butyrate (Stams and Plugge, 2009). Similar mechanisms also apply for amino acid fermentation. Amino acid pairs can be degraded when they are coupled with hydrogen producing and hydrogen consuming reactions (Stickland reactions) to avoid hydrogen accumulation. Single amino acids can be fermented in a process that requires the presence of hydrogen-utilizing bacteria such as methanogens (Ramsay and Pullammanappallil, 2001). Degradation of long-chain fatty acids is also only possible at low hydrogen partial pressure (Sousa et al., 2007). Hydrogen is involved in many reactions and it can shift the reaction equilibrium. Because acetate and butyrate formation from glucose are accompanied by hydrogen production (Eqs. 6 and 7 in Table 3), our expectation with the high hydrogen partial pressure was that monomer degradation would be towards more reduced compounds such as alcohols or caproate. It is not clear why butyrate and acetate production reactions were more favorable under a headspace of 2bar hydrogen in headspace. This raises the question whether hydrogen serves as electron donor in our experiments in the electron carrier system together with protons as electron acceptor. Studies with single culture fermentation showed that depending on environmental conditions, bacteria can use other electron carrier systems apart from the proton/hydrogen couple, such as proton/formate (Müller et al., 2010). Mixed cultures, apparently, can tolerate high hydrogen partial pressure if not produced via fermentation reactions and can continue to produce acetate and butyrate in higher concentrations than under conditions having no headspace manipulation. However, as observed by Steinbusch et al. (2011), an even longer incubation period (>30days) might have led to additional adaptation of microorganisms and reactions towards the more reduced C6 or C8 carboxylates. As a matter of fact, we did observe the onset of H2 consumption in the carbohydrate fermentor under increased H2 pressure after 2weeks of incubation, with the concomitant production of caproate. The experiments showed various effects of the presence of hydrogen and carbon dioxide on fermentation product concentration and distribution: – Adding 2bar of hydrogen to the headspace increases the total carboxylate production, but does not result in selective product formation. Acetate and butyrate productions were not limited by elevated hydrogen partial pressures in the headspace. On the contrary, higher concentrations of acetate and butyrate could be generated, albeit in equal amounts. – Adding 2bar of hydrogen and carbon dioxide 50:50 (v:v) directed the fermentation to acetate production due to homoacetogenic activity. – Adding 2bar of carbon dioxide to the headspace favored the butyrate production up to 70% fraction, after 1week of incubation. – Adding hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide to the headspace ceased propionate production. This is contrary to expectation since propionate production from glucose is accompanied by hydrogen consumption. – Even when carbon dioxide is not consumed, it can shift fermentation equilibria when present at sufficiently high pressures. Carbon dioxide can thus be used to direct the fermentation to butyrate while a mixed hydrogen–carbon dioxide headspace yields acetate as major product. Still, it is important to note that a compromise often needs to be found between the highest product concentration and the highest fraction. While a high fraction may facilitate further product purification steps, a minimal concentration level is equally important to develop cost efficient processes. Although the presented results showed clear effects of headspace modification on fermentation reactions, this work should be considered a first step. Further research is required to explore the details of the processes concerned and confirm the suggested explanations for some of the experimental observations."
9,Conclusions,"This study showed that concentrations and fractions of carboxylates can be directed by supplying additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the headspace in mixed culture fermentation. Butyrate, caproate and total product concentration increases were higher in reactors with modified headspace than in the control reactor while propionate production was ceased. Carbon dioxide was not consumed from the headspace but it directed the fermentation process towards selective production of butyrate within 1week. Acetate production was selective and in high concentrations within 4weeks under mixed hydrogen and carbon dioxide headspace. A major single compound was not found under hydrogen headspace."
