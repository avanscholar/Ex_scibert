0,Introduction,
1,Motivation,"1.1 Motivation The reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols and the reverse, i.e., the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones are fundamental reactions in synthetic organic chemistry and an enormous variety of both stochiometric and catalytic methods have been developed [1,2]. In contrast there exist only few methods for the selective oxidation of vic-diols to the corresponding α-hydroxy-ketones [3,4]. In particular, viable methods for the oxidation of secondary hydroxyl functions in unprotected sugar polyalcohols [5] and furanose and pyranose sugars to give the corresponding furanuloses and pyranuloses are very rare [6,7]. A selective oxidation of vic-diols is challenging because the α-hydroxy-ketones are easily over-oxidized to diketones and ultimately carboxylic acids through oxidative C–C bond cleavage [4] and also tend to show uncontrollable secondary reactivity under the often either basic or acidic reaction conditions required by the oxidizing reagents employed. One of the most active and versatile among the homogeneous catalytic sec-alcohol/ketone oxidation/reduction systems are the metal-ligand bifunctional ruthenium complexes of the type [(η6-arene)Ru(XCH(C6H5)CH(C6H5)NH n )Y] (arene=1- i Pr-4-Me-C6H4 or similar, X=O, NTs, Y=Cl, H or not present for n =1, n =1 or 2) developed by Noyori and co-workers [8–12]. While the application focus of these catalysts in their optically active forms has been on the highly successful enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of ketones using iso-propanol as both the solvent and reducing agent, Noyori and co-workers also demonstrated that the η6-arene diamine ruthenium(II) based catalysts [(η6-1- i Pr-4-Me-C6H4)Ru(H)(1R,2R- NH(Ts)-CH(C6H5)CH(C6H5)NH2)] (1H) or the corresponding hydrogen deficient 16 electron complex (1) can successfully be employed under oxidizing conditions (i.e., in acetone solvent) without the presence of a base. This allows the kinetic resolution of racemic benzylic or allylic alcohols achieving high ee values (92–99%) at 50% conversion of one alcohol enantiomer to the corresponding ketone within 6–36h at 28°C [13]. However to our knowledge only benzylic and allylic alcohols have been oxidized under the kinetic resolution conditions [13], while the transfer dehydrogenation of aliphatic alcohols or vicinal diols has not been reported in the literature."
2,Experimental,
3,General,"2.1 General NMR spectra (400MHz/1H; 100MHz/13C) were measured in DMSO-d6 with DMSO (δ 2.49, 1H; δ 39.5, 13C) and deuterated chloroform (δ 7.24, 1H; δ 77.0, 13C) as the internal reference unless indicated otherwise. NMR solvents were stored inside a dry-box under argon atmosphere over 4Å activated molecular sieves. For variable temperature measurements the spectrometer temperature controller unit was calibrated using a bimetal thermometer directly inserted into the probe. DFT calculations were carried on a PC using the Gaussian 03 suite of programs. GC analyses were performed on a 30m×0.25mm PEG column. The GC FID was calibrated for alcohol and ketone substrates with cis-decalin as an internal standard. GC–MS experiments were performed on a Varian 3800, Saturn 2000 a 30m×0.25mm PEG column with 70V electron impact ionization or acetonitrile chemical ionization technique. IR spectra were recorded with a Bomen FT-IR using a 1.0 and 2.0mm CaF2 liquid cell or a 15μm cell containing a Teflon® washer (15μm) between two BaF2 cell windows. The IR cells were filled with the oxygen sensitive 16-electron complexes inside a glove box and carefully sealed from air atmosphere. Electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry was conducted on a JEOL HX110 double focussing mass spectrometer ionizing at 70eV with source temperature at 200°C. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was conducted on a MicroMass QTOF Global Mass spectrometer in a positive ionization mode (3.5kV spray voltage) at atmospheric pressure in acetonitrile. All experimental preparations were conducted in a dry-box under argon atmosphere and/or with usual Schlenk technique on a vacuum line. Acetone, iso-propanol and CH2Cl2 were dried by distillation under argon from anhydrous CaCl2, anhydrous K2CO3 containing LiAlH4 and K2CO3, respectively, degassed and stored under argon. Water was distilled under argon immediately before use. Alcohol and ketone substrates, cis-decalin and common solvents were purchased from commercial sources. All chemicals were reagent grade and used after degassing through repetitive freeze–thaw cycles. N-(p-tosyl)-1,2-diaminoethane [14], N-(p-tosyl)-ortho-diaminobenzene [15], 1,2-dinitro-1,1,2,2-tetramethylethane [16], 1,2-diamino-1,1,2,2-tetramethylethane [16], meso-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane [14] and N-(p-tosyl)-meso-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane [14,17] were prepared according to published literature procedures. meso-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane is commercially available."

After completion of the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture was kept at 40°C for 3h, then increased to refluxing temperature for 30min. After cooling to ambient temperature, white solids precipitated, which were filtered and dried in vacuo yielding 8.2g of crude product. The product was dissolved in 1M HCl (50mL), filtered through celite and the remaining clear solution was cooled to 0°C and 6M NaOH (50mL) was added carefully. The resulting white precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuo. 85% yield (6.2g, 23mmol).

A white precipitate appeared and was filtered and treated with 1M hydrochloric acid (∼50mL). The remaining solid was filtered and filtrate made strongly basic by addition of NaOH pellets (∼4g).

The Schlenk flask was evacuated and re-filled with Ar three times and 15mL dry, under Ar distilled dichloromethane was added with a syringe. The red/orange solution was stirred for 10min at room temperature and finely ground potassium hydroxide (0.5g) was added. The reaction mixture was red coloured and stirred for additional 45min at room temperature. Then, 15mL of oxygen free water was added with a syringe and the white solid and excess KOH were dissolved. The greenish aqueous solution was removed with a canula and the remaining dichloromethane solution was dried with CaH2 (∼0.4g) until hydrogen gas evolution stopped.

5,Kinetic experiments,"2.3 Kinetic experiments The reactions were carried out in a 7mL screw top vial equipped with a stir bar inside a glovebox under Ar atmosphere. GC-monitoring was conducted typically after 6h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 7 d and 14 d by direct injection of the crude reaction mixture. 2.3.1 Typical procedure under oxidizing/reducing condition Alcohol/ketone substrate (1.0mmol), 16-electron ruthenium catalyst (0.010mmol) and cis-decalin (∼50mg) were dissolved in 5.0mL acetone/iso-propanol in a 7mL vial and stirred at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by quantitative GC using cis-decalin as the internal standard. 2.3.2 Typical procedure for equal-concentration experiments Alcohol substrate (0.50mmol), ketone substrate (0.50mmol) and cis-decalin (∼50mg) were dissolved in 2.4mL acetone (2.4mL) and iso-propanol (2.5mL). Then, 16-electron ruthenium complex (0.010mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT. The reaction was monitored by quantitative GC using cis-decalin as the internal standard."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Selection of catalyst system and oxidation substrates,"3.1 Selection of catalyst system and oxidation substrates The most active ruthenium catalysts for “forward” reactions, i.e., reductions of ketones in iso-propanol solvents, were obtained with β-amino-ethanol and N-tosyl-1,2-diaminoethane as the ligands [9]. Presumably the resulting complexes allow the most facile access of substrates to the catalytically active centre because of the least amount of steric repulsion with the ethylene backbone [9,11,18]. Cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol and 1,2;5,6-O-diisopropylidine α-d-gluco-furanoside (diacetone-glucose) were chosen as model systems for sugar substrates for an initial evaluation of β-amino-ethanol and N-tosyl-1,2-diaminoethane p-cymene ruthenium complexes as catalysts in hydrogen transfer reactions under oxidizing conditions, i.e., in acetone or cyclohexanone solvent."
8,Transfer dehydrogenation reactions with known systems,"3.2 Transfer dehydrogenation reactions with known systems The results of the oxidation of cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol and diacetone-glucose with the β-aminoethanol p-cymene-ruthenium hydride complex (2H), which was synthesized according to literature procedure [18], are shown in Table 1 . The oxidation reactions were monitored by quantitative GC using N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP) as the internal standard. The experimental technique and actual activity of the catalyst was verified in a control experiment by the quantitative reduction of acetophenone to 1-phenyl-ethanol in iso-propanol after 6h at room temperature using an authentic catalyst sample from the same synthesis batch [8]. In all oxidation reactions, the initial colour of the reaction solution is purple but turned to dark brown containing black precipitate after 24–48h indicating the formation of ruthenium(0) as by-product of catalyst decomposition. Even at the very high catalyst load of 10mol%, the room temperature oxidation of cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol in acetone solvent was very slow giving less than 15% conversion after 24–48h (Table 1, entries 1,3,5). An increase in temperature to 56°C (b.p. of acetone) increased the conversion of cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol to 15% and 46%, respectively. A higher temperature was reached when the ketone solvent was cyclohexanone, which is not only preferred as a higher boiling solvent but also releases ring strain energy upon formation of cyclohexanol [19]. With cyclohexanone as the hydrogen-acceptor, cyclopentanol was oxidized to cyclopentanone in 70% yield after 24h at 100°C (Table 1, entry 6). Diacetone-glucose was not oxidized with acetone as the hydrogen-acceptor at 56°C but oxidation occurred with cyclohexanone at 100 and 150°C with 12% and 71% of cyclohexanol produced, which as a first approximation should be equivalent to the amount of diacetone-glucose oxidized. However, isolation attempts of the product of the diacetone-glucose reaction (Table 1, entry 9) failed and NMR analysis of the recovered solids revealed an intractable mixture of organic compounds generated through undefined side-reactions at the higher reaction temperature. Important insights into the relative stability of the Noyori catalyst under reducing and oxidizing conditions in acetone or cyclohexanone solvent emerge from these results. Under reducing conditions in iso-propanol solvent the reaction mixture is yellow-orange coloured indicating that the resting state is the 18-electron ruthenium hydride complex 2H as illustrated in Scheme 1 . However, under oxidizing conditions in acetone or cyclohexanone solvent, the deep purple colour suggest that the 16-electron complex 2 is the dominant resting state (the same observations apply to the N-tosyl-1,2-diaminoethane complexes 3 and 3H). We next attempted to use the 16-electron complexes 2 and 3 directly as the catalyst in order to establish whether this would have a positive effect on the reaction rate as the initial step is the dehydrogenation of the alcohol substrate. The syntheses of the 16-electron β-aminoethanol and N-tosyl-1,2-diaminoethylene-p-cymene ruthenium complexes 2 and 3 (Chart 1 ) were conducted in analogy to the reported synthetic procedure [8]. However, the syntheses and isolation of both 16-electron complexes 2 and 3 failed. The purple colour of either 16-electron complex was briefly observed after addition of KOH to a CH2Cl2 solution of the chloro complexes 2Cl and 3Cl (cf. Scheme 1), but the reaction mixture turned black within minutes and undefined solids were obtained. We therefore hypothesize that the 16-electron complexes 2 and 3 undergo a β-hydride elimination reaction forming the imine and aldehyde based ligands as shown in Scheme 2 , immediately followed by reductive elimination of the ligand leading to the complete disintegration of the complexes and formation of ruthenium(0). GC–MS analysis of the dark brown reaction mixture was however inconclusive as even with mild chemical ionization methods (acetonitrile) the presence of the very reactive imine and aldehyde intermediates could not be unambiguously determined. Implicit in these observations is that during catalysis under reducing conditions, i.e., in iso-propanol solvent, the hydrogenation of the 16-electron complexes 2 and 3, which by necessity must also be formed as reactive intermediates during the catalytic cycle, must be a lot faster than the ultimately destructive β-hydride elimination process."
9,Design and synthesis of oxidation resistant ligands,"3.3 Design and synthesis of oxidation resistant ligands To avoid β-hydride elimination, the synthesis of oxidation resistant ethylene diamine ligands containing no β-hydrides or disfavouring a β-hydride elimination, was planned and executed. The three target ligands N-tosyl-ortho-diaminobenzene (4), N-tosyl-1,2-diamino-1,1,2,2-tetramethylethane (5) and N-tosyl-meso-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane (6) prepared as the racemic mixture, are shown in Chart 2 . While the diamino compounds 4 and 5 do not contain any β-hydrides, the meso-1,2-diphenyl ligand (6) contains two β-hydrogen atoms. A β-hydride elimination from a 16-electron ruthenium complex of 6 was however not anticipated, as the complexes of the corresponding diastereomeric ligands (R,R- and S,S-configuration), which have an anti-arrangement of the phenyl substituents, have been shown to be stable under oxidizing conditions [13]. In the corresponding 18-electron complexes the syn-disubstituted 1,2-diaminoethane ligands should preferably coordinate to the ruthenium centre in an exo- rather than an endo-conformation as illustrated in Fig. 1 . In the exo-position the phenyl ligands point away from the reactive catalytic centre thus enabling a more facile access of an ketone to the hydride ligand. By the same argument an alcohol would approach the ruthenium centre in a 16-electron complex in such a way that the exo-conformation of the hydride complex would be formed. The catalytic activities of the syn- and anti-disubstituted ligand are comparable [17], but the enantioselectivity of the reduction of aromatic ketones was generally decreased with optically pure syn-disubstituted ethylene ligands in η6-arene ruthenium complexes compared to those in the anti-configuration. For the targeted non-enantioselective dehydrogenation reactions this is however not relevant and we postulated that the higher steric accessibility of the ruthenium centre imparted by the syn-exo arrangement of the phenyl ligands would result in a more active catalyst. The synthesis of N-tosyl-ortho-diaminobenzene (4) was carried out by tosylation of o-amino-aniline following known literature procedures [15]. The new ligand N-tosyl-1,2-diamino-1,1,2,2-tetramethylethane (5) was prepared by a three step synthesis as shown in Scheme 3 . The first step was the oxidative fusion of 2-nitro-propane to 1,2-dinitro-tetramethylethane in ethanol solvent with elemental bromine under basic conditions in 97% yield [16]. Subsequent reduction of the nitro groups to primary amines was effected by elemental tin in acidic medium. The resulting white solids were purified by steam distillation. Tosylation of the diamine compound with substoichiometric p-tosyl chloride in pyridine solvent gave 5 in 85% yield. As outlined in Scheme 4 the precursor to the third ligand, meso-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane (6) was synthesized from the reaction of neat benzaldehyde and ammonium acetate under refluxing conditions in 50% yield after recrystallization from methanol [17,20]. The meso-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane compound obtained was subsequently mono-tosylated with substoichiometric amounts of p-toluyl-sulfonyl chloride in pyridine to give racemic N-tosyl-meso-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diamino-ethane (6) in 48% yield."
10,Synthesis and properties of the new Noyori type complexes,"3.4 Synthesis and properties of the new Noyori type complexes The three N-tosyl-1,2-diamine ligands 4, 5 and 6 were then used to prepare the corresponding 16 electron η6-p-cymene ruthenium complexes 7, 8 and 9. Their structures are shown in Chart 3 . All three complexes were synthesized in analogy to published literature procedures [8,18]. The [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2 precursor [21], synthesized from α-pinene and ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate in refluxing ethanol, was reacted with one equivalent N-tosyl-diamino ligand at room temperature in degassed dichloromethane under Ar atmosphere giving the chloro complexes, which can be isolated as solids in 82% (7Cl), 94% (8Cl) and 92% (9Cl) yield, respectively. The chloro complexes were however not characterized, but directly further reacted to the 16-electron complexes in the same solution. Addition of solid KOH, produced a bright red coloured reaction mixtures of the corresponding 16 electron complexes with 7Cl and 9Cl and a deep purple colour with 8Cl. The compounds 7 and 8 are new compounds while 9/9H have previously been generated in situ using the optically pure (1S,2R)-ligand enantiomer [17]. The tetramethyl complex (8) and meso-diphenyl complex (9) are both extremely air-sensitive when dissolved in organic solvents, but can with the rigorous exclusion of oxygen be held in solution for weeks while maintaining their catalytic activity. All three 16 electron complexes can be isolated as solids in very good to excellent yields and their identity and elemental composition is confirmed by high-resolution ESI mass spectra [22]. Complexes 7 and 8 give well defined 1H and 13C NMR spectra C6D6 and CD2Cl2, respectively, but the red solution of complex 9 in CD2Cl2 gives complex spectra showing a mixture of different species with four hydride peaks at −5.65, −5.87, −6.26 and −6.39ppm (see Supplementary Material for images of NMR spectra of all three complexes). An integration of the hydride signals against all other protons present indicates that ∼22% of complex 9 is present in a hydride form, suggesting partial reaction to several different hydride complexes via a β-hydride elimination pathway (cf. Scheme 3). Complex 9 thus did not match our prediction of being resistant to β-hydride eliminations and behaves differently than the corresponding optically pure (1S,2S)-N-p-tolulenesulfonyl-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane based complexes with anti oriented phenyl substituents that result in well defined spectra and allowed a rare X-ray crystallographic structure determination of a 16-electron complex [8]. However, in contrast to complexes 2 and 3, no brown or black precipitates formed over the course of several days. Instead solutions of complex 9 and its hydride derivatives maintain their red colour and NMR spectrum appearance for days, which prompted us to explore the catalytic activity of this material under both reducing and oxidizing conditions and compare it to that of complexes 7 and 9 (see below). During our study Wills and co-workers described the use of enantiomerically pure 1S,2R-6 generating the corresponding 18-electron hydride complex in situ under reducing conditions, but gave no characterization data for this complex [17]."
11,Hydrogen transfer reactions with degradation resistant ligands,"3.5 Hydrogen transfer reactions with degradation resistant ligands The catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity of the ortho-diaminobenzene ruthenium complex 7 was investigated under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. A typical reaction was the oxidation of 1-phenyl-ethanol (1.0mmol, 0.20M) in 5.0mL degassed acetone with 0.010mmol (1mol%) ruthenium complex 7 and cis-decalin as internal GC standard at ambient temperature and Ar atmosphere. No catalytic activity was observed with 1-phenyl-ethanol and cyclohexanol after 7 days. After 4 weeks, the contents of acetophenone and cyclohexanone were only ∼1%. For an investigation of the catalytic hydrogenation activity under reducing conditions, the same concentrations as under oxidizing conditions were employed with acetophenone (1.0mmol, 0.20M) as the substrate, 0.010mmol (1mol%) ruthenium complex 7 and cis-decalin in 5.0mL degassed iso-propanol solvent at room temperature and under Ar atmosphere. Again the phenylene complex 7 showed no catalytic activity in reduction of acetophenone to 1-phenyl ethanol and only very marginal activity for the conversion of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanol (11% after four weeks). We attribute the low reactivity of 7 to the ability of the ortho-diaminobenzene to act as a non-innocent ligand, formally coordinating to the ruthenium centre as an ortho-quinone type system as illustrated in Scheme 5 . This fundamentally alters the electronic environment of the ruthenium centre compared to the typical Noyori system and is reflected in differences of the NMR shifts of the arene ligand. The aromatic hydrogens of the cymene ligand have a chemical shift of 5.17 and 5.05ppm in the tetramethyl-ruthenium compound 8 but in the ortho-diaminobenzene compound 7 the proton resonances are shifted downfield by approximately 0.5 to 5.67ppm and 5.63ppm, which indicates a higher ring current and thus more electron density donate towards the π*-orbitals of the cymene moiety. This electron density must originate from a more electron rich ruthenium centre than in the tetramethyl ruthenium complex, which in turn can be rationalized through the resonance structure 7′ on the right of Scheme 5, which postulates a ruthenium(0) centre. Hydrogen transfer reaction under reducing and oxidizing conditions were carried out with a series of representative secondary alcohol/ketone pairs and the tetramethyl complex (8) as the catalyst. Standard conditions for the oxidation reactions were again alcohol (1.0mmol, 0.20M) in 5.0mL degassed acetone with 0.010mmol (1mol%) ruthenium complex 8 at ambient temperature and Ar atmosphere and cis-decalin as the internal GC standard. The results of these oxidation reactions are shown in Fig. 2 . The reducing conditions employed the same concentrations as the oxidizing conditions, but with ketone substrate in iso-propanol solvent. The results of the reductions are shown in Fig. 3 . Under reducing conditions with iso-propanol as solvent and hydrogen source, the reaction mixture was yellow. In contrast, under oxidizing conditions the colour was deep purple. The catalytic hydrogen transfer activity of 8 under reducing condition is much lower compared to the TON and TOF for 1, 2, or 3 reported by Noyori and co-workers, which reported a quantitative reduction of acetophenone to 1-phenyl-ethanol within 24h [9,18]. The lower activity is likely a result of the steric hindrance by the four methyl groups present on the ethylene backbone in 8. As shown in Fig. 3, cyclohexanone and β-tetralone were quantitatively reduced to their corresponding alcohols within ∼5 d at room temperature and a 1mol% catalyst load in iso-propanol solvent. After 14 d acetophenone reacted to 95%, cyclopentanone 52% and α-tetralone 37% to their corresponding alcohols. Under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2) the order of reactivity is reversed compared to the reducing conditions and the catalytic activity is even lower and no quantitative oxidation of any substrate was observed even after 14 d. The 1-phenyl-ethanol content after 14 d is 69% compared to 82% of cyclopentanol. In order to probe the temperature response of catalyst 8, reactions with the cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol and α-tetralone/α-tetralol substrate pairs were carried out under both reducing and oxidizing conditions at 22 and 50°C. The data in Table 2 summarizes the results of these reactions. Under both oxidizing and reducing conditions the overall conversions of alcohol or ketone starting material of the hydrogen transfer reactions as well as the conversion after 24h were increased at the elevated temperature. However, even at the higher temperature cyclohexanol was only 5% converted after 7 d compared to 3% after 7 d at room temperature. Noyori and co-workers reported that the reduction of ketone substrates in iso-propanol solvent is first order with regards to the ketone. Similarly, the oxidation of allylic and benzylic alcohols in acetone solvent was first order in alcohol [13]. Thus assuming a pseudo first order rate law in alcohol under oxidizing condition and pseudo first order rate law in ketone under reducing condition we determined the corresponding rate constants from the concentration vs. time plots of the substrates as determined by quantitative GC (Figs. 2 and 3). Comparing the rate constants of the respective alcohol and ketone substrate pairs (Table 3 ) shows that the rates of the reductions are generally one to two orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding rates of oxidation. The exception is the α-tetralol/α-tetralone pair for which the oxidation reaction is markedly faster than the reduction, a fact that must be related to the formation of a benzylic conjugated carbonyl function upon oxidation of the alcohol. The implications of this phenomenon are discussed in greater detail in later sections (vide infra). The tetramethyl complex 8 was also tested in the oxidation of cis-and trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol as the substrate (1.0mmol) in 5.0mL acetone and cyclohexanone solvent at room temperature under Ar atmosphere. However, after 7 d only trace amounts (<2%) of iso-propanol or cyclohexanol as well α-hydroxy-cyclohexanone substrate were detected. The reactivity of the diol substrate was in the same range as the oxidation of the cyclohexanol model system and thus further studies were focussed on the oxidation of the cyclohexanol model system. Complex 9 was tested with the same cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone and α-tetralol/α-tetralone substrate pairs under oxidizing and reducing conditions using the same standard concentrations of 1.0mmol substrate in 5.0mL solvent, 1.0mol% catalyst load and cis-decalin as the internal GC standard. Cyclohexanol was oxidized to cyclohexanone after 24h only in trace amounts (<1%) and a 2% content was detected after 14 d at room temperature. In contrast, the same catalyst is much more active under reducing conditions 68% of cyclohexanone were reduced to cyclohexanol after 24h, 88% after 48 and 95% after 72h at room temperature. Under oxidizing conditions, α-tetralol was oxidized to α-tetralone in 20% after 24h and 84% after 14 d at room temperature. In contrast, the reduction of α-tetralone yielded no reaction after 24h and only 14% after 14 d. While the tetramethyl complex 8 is stable in solution for 3–4 weeks the diphenyl complex 9 starts to decompose after 2 weeks and a brown precipitate appears, presumably formed via the already discussed β-hydride elimination pathways."
12,Investigations into the coordinative inhibition of 16 electron complexes,"3.6 Investigations into the coordinative inhibition of 16 electron complexes We hypothesized that one possible reason for the slower oxidation reaction could be a coordinative inhibition of the catalysts (8 and 9) under oxidizing conditions through coordination of acetone or cyclohexanone solvent towards the Ru metal centre or amide/amine functionality of the catalyst (Chart 4 ). Coordination of acetone can in principle occur through an η1 or η2 coordination of the CO function, both of which have been shown to occur at various metal centres [23,24], or by enolization of the acetone and cooperative coordination of the resulting CC double bond and hydroxyl function. This hypothesis was investigated by a series of NMR experiments. A sample of complex 8 was prepared in acetone-d6 and scrambling of the amide proton (7.3ppm) was observed at ambient temperature in less than 24h. In benzene-d6 and CD2Cl2 solvent no scrambling was observed. All three solutions remained purple in a sealed NMR tube for over 2 months at ambient temperature and no decomposition was observed. In CDCl3 the complex decomposed to black precipitate after one week at room temperature. The scrambling of the amide proton can be explained through a rapid D/H exchange of acetone-d6 with the amide through ketone-enol tautomerism of acetone in solution or through a possible η2 coordination of the acetone enol to the Ru and NH moiety as shown in Chart 4. To further test this hypothesis, a low temperature 2H NMR experiment with 8 was carried out in acetone-d6 solvent at 400MHz aiming to observe any olefinic signals of the complexed enol form of acetone. The sample was cooled to −80°C and continuously shimmed observing the 2H solvent signal. The sample was then allowed to thermally equilibrate at −80°C for 15min and the 2H spectrum was recorded, however no olefinic 2H signals were observed in the 3–6ppm range. This means that the either there is no exchange of D/H with the amide function through the postulated η 2 coordination mechanism or it occurs so rapidly that even at −80°C that the exchange of formed enol–Ru complex and surrounding acetone is still too fast to be observed on the time scale of the NMR experiment. To test for coordination of the non-enolized form of a ketone solvent, a 13C NMR experiment was carried out with the same sample as well as cyclohexanone and complex 8. For the second sample 30mg of the 16-electron complex 8 was dissolved in 0.6mL CD2Cl2, ten equivalents of cyclohexanone added and the 13C NMR spectra recorded at room temperature. The 13C NMR resonance of a carbonyl carbon complexed to a metal centre typically occur in the normal downfield range of carbonyl resonances for η1 coordination but the resonances for η2 coordinated carbonyl groups are observed in the upfield range of 45–110ppm [23]. However, even with extensive data aquisition (4000 scans) no carbonyl resonances shifted from those of free cyclohexanone (211.5ppm) could be observed in either experiment. In conclusion, all experimental NMR evidence suggested that the exchange of the NH-proton occurs very rapidly at room temperature and even −80°C is too fast to be observed on the NMR time scale. In the 13C and low temperature 2H NMR experiment, no additional signals other than the free ketone were observed. NMR thus fails to provide any evidence for a coordinative inhibition of the 16-electron complex of 8 and 9 under oxidizing conditions. In a corresponding IR experiment that in principle allows the investigation of carbonyl coordination to a metal centre on much faster time scales, the ν CO stretching frequency of acetone can be used as a sensitive probe for coordination of acetone in a η1 or η2 fashion, however η1 coordination of a ketone to a metal centre lowers the ν CO usually less than 100cm−1. In contrast, with η2 coordination of ketone to a metal centre the ν CO is observed in the range of 1017–1160cm−1 due to the loss in bond order in carbon–oxygen bond [23,24]. One to ten equivalents of acetone were added to a dichloromethane solution containing complex 8 in a CaF2 cell with 0.2mm optical path length. No shift of the ν CO frequency was observed when comparing the IR spectrum of this sample to reference IR spectra of acetone or complex 8 recorded in dichloromethane. In another IR experiment complex 8 (10mg) was dissolved in neat acetone (0.5mL) and the IR spectrum was recorded using a cell with a very small (15μm) optical path length. Even with this very short optical path length, the intensity of the ν CO stretching frequency was too strong so that the maximum bottomed out between 1707 and 1715cm−1. Again no shifted signal in the 1600–1700cm−1 range or lower than 1600cm−1 could be observed. On the basis of NMR and IR evidence we therefore conclude that the Ru centre of 8 is inert towards coordination by the acetone solvent and that the observed lower catalytic activity of the tetramethyl Ru complex in the oxidation reaction cannot be attributed to an inhibition of the 16-electron species by the surrounding ketone solvent."
13,Thermodynamic investigations and models,"3.7 Thermodynamic investigations and models In the absence of evidence for any coordinative inhibition of the catalysts under oxidizing conditions, our investigations centered on a thermodynamical approach in order to explain the slower oxidation vs. reduction rates. A full kinetic analysis aimed at gaining further insights into the reaction parameters was not attempted on the basis of the following considerations: As illustrated in Scheme 1, there exist two distinct resting states of the catalysts system in solution, the hydrogen deficient 16-electron complex 8 and the hydrogen loaded 18 electron complex 8H. Effectively, there are therefore two different catalysts at different concentrations present in solution at any given time, the relative concentrations of which are a function of the redox potential and concentration of the participating alcohol/ketone pairs (both substrate and solvent). Determining these concentrations constitutes a major challenge to developing any kinetic model and to our knowledge no complete kinetic model and rate law taking this fact into account is available for the Noyori system. In consequence, we focused on thermodynamic parameters only, beginning with thermochemical calculations of the free reaction enthalpies of the isodesmic hydrogen transfer reactions. As the literature availability of experimental ΔG° values for the ketone/alcohol pairs selected by us is very limited, the relative free energies of the participating alcohol and ketone substrate with acetone and iso-propanol were determined through Gaussian 03 calculations by density functional theory [25]. The standard free energy of the transfer (de)hydrogenation of each alcohol with the acetone/iso-propanol pair, i.e., ΔG°, was calculated for the generic reaction shown in Scheme 6 and the equilibrium constants were calculated from ΔG°=−RT ln K at 298K. In order to correlate the calculated ΔG° results with the reaction actually carried out, ΔG reaction was calculated for the conditions using Eq. (1) shown below. The initial concentration of alcohol substrate was 0.2M and acetone solvent is present at 13.6M. Plots of ΔG reaction vs. the concentration of produced ketone are shown in Fig. 4. (1) Δ G reaction = Δ G ° + RT ln ⁡ Q , Q = [ ketone ] [ isopropanol ] [ alcohol ] [ acetone ] , [ ketone ] produced = [ isopropanol ] produced = : x = x 2 [ 0.2 − x ] [ 13.6 − x ] , [ alcohol ] initial = 0.2 M, [ acetone ] initial = 13.6 M, T = 298 K The calculated ΔG reaction values for the majority of the alcohol and ketone substrate pairs pass through and cluster around the zero-line, i.e., they are essentially thermoneutral. However the values for the α-tetralol/α-tetralone, 1-phenyl-ethanol/acetophenone and cyclopentanol/cyclopentanone pairs indicated in Fig. 4 are distinctively more negative suggesting that the equilibrium constitutes a quantitative oxidation of the alcohol to the corresponding ketone. These results are in principle congruent with the experimental values shown in Fig. 2, however the equilibrium for theses reactions had not been reached after 14 d. The results of the DFT calculations of ΔG reaction for the reaction involving the reduction of ketones (0.2M) in 5.0mL iso-propanol (13.1M) are displayed in Fig. 5 and also show a good correlation to the experimental data (Fig. 3). The reduction of α-tetralone is thermodynamically unfavoured and only a marginal α-tetralol content can be obtained at the equilibrium. The reductions of cyclopentanone and acetophenone are not as favoured as the other calculated ketone substrates, but the plots suggest that a quantitative conversion can be obtained at equilibrium. Since the DFT calculations were carried out on the 6–31/g(d) level for the gas phase environment a finite error must be attributed to the calculated values. In solution hydrogen bonding does occur especially in iso-propanol solvent which further affects the minimum energies and will influence the ΔG reaction values. However since the calculation of the ΔG reaction values involves taking the differences of the absolute ΔG values for an isodesmic reaction, it is reasonable to assume that the errors cancel out at least partially minimizing their effect on the relative results (see below for a direct comparison of theoretical with experimental results). From the experimental data (Tables 2 and 3) it is apparent that the reactions possessing a very negative ΔG° value in either oxidation or reduction direction were faster than those with lower ΔG° values. This observation suggests a relationship similar to the Hammond postulate, i.e., for the hydrogen transfer reaction under investigation, ΔG ‡ is correlated to ΔG°. With our observation that the resting state of the catalyst is dependent on the redox environment of the reaction partners involving solvents and alcohol and ketone substrates, the actual rate of reaction is then a superposition of the oxidation and reduction parameters for each of the two catalytically active species, i.e., one would expect substantially different rates for the forward and reverse reaction. As mentioned previously we refrained from trying to develop a full kinetic model for the Noyori system, as it would require a simultaneous knowledge of the actual relative concentrations of the two active catalysts species and the pairs ketones and alcohols present, which experimentally is difficult to realize [26]. In order to at least qualitatively detect the relative concentration of 8 in its 16-electron or 18-electron hydrogen loaded form, a simple experiment was carried out inside a glove-box under Ar atmosphere. Three solutions of 8 (5.0mg) were prepared using (A) 5.0mL acetone, (B) 5.0mL iso-propanol and (C) a mixture of iso-propanol (2.5mL) and acetone (2.5mL). The acetone solution (A) was deep blue-purple coloured. The iso-propanol solution (B) was orange-yellow coloured after approximately 15min at room temperature and the 1:1 acetone: iso-propanol mixture (C) was dark red-purple coloured. After addition of iso-propanol (1.0mL) to (A) the colour changed slightly to a reddish-purple similar to the solution (C). A similar colour resulted in addition of acetone (1.0mL) to (B). After addition of 15mL of iso-propanol i.e. a 1:20 mixture acetone: iso-propanol, the colour intensity reduces due to concentration effect but there is no change back to a yellow colour. Addition of 15mL acetone to (A) produced a deep purple solution with a taint of red. We therefore concluded that the 16-electron complex is the predominant species in any iso-propanol/acetone solvent mixture. The kinetic data analysis was limited to determining the initial rates for the reaction, for which in a first approximation the reactant concentrations are known. Within this ultimately thermodynamic approach to the problem, there is however one single situation where there is no need in knowing the actual kinetic law of the reaction in order determine a correlation between ΔG° and initial rates. This situation arises, when both the oxidized and reduced substrate as well as the oxidizing and reducing solvent are present in equal concentrations [27]. At time t=0 this is a condition easily realized experimentally. As expressed by Eq. (2), ΔG reaction equals ΔG° at t initial =0, when the concentration of ketone and alcohol substrate as well the concentrations of acetone and iso-propanol solvent are set to be equal. Through cancellation of the respective concentration values Q is 1 and hence ln Q is zero. The combined ketone and alcohol concentration was set to 0.2M with 0.010mmol ruthenium catalyst in order to be able to compare results with the experimental and calculated data for the oxidation or reduction reactions. Another advantage of the equal concentration experiment is the direct experimental determination of ΔG° from the substrate and reactant concentration (by quantitative GC analysis) once the equilibrium has been established. The error margin for this determination is low as neither the numerator nor the denominator of the equilibrium constant equation, K is close to zero. (2) For the special situation of equal initial concentrations of all redox substrate pairs, it can also be assumed that the rate law for the forward reaction (Eq. (3)) and the rate law of the backward reaction (Eq. (4)) are only a function of the concentrations of ketone and alcohol and catalyst in its hydrogen loaded and unloaded form, respectively. (3) r forward ( t = 0 ) = k forward × [ ketone ] initial × [ cat- H 2 ] (4) r reverse ( t = 0 ) = k reverse × [ alcohol ] initial × [ cat ] In this situation, the free energy of the hydrogen transfer reaction of a given alcohol/ketone substrate pair can therefore be visualized experimentally. The overall direction of the hydrogen transfer reaction can easily be determined by quantitative GC measurements of the alcohol/ketone substrate concentration. The standard free energy, ΔG° can then be determined experimentally through calculation of the equilibrium constant K when the hydrogen transfer reaction has reached its equilibrium stage, i.e., the concentrations of the reactants do no longer change with time [28]. The initial rates also obtained from the equal concentration experiments are listed in Table 4 and are based on the observed production or consumption of alcohol substrate, i.e., under overall reducing condition ketone substrate reacts to the corresponding alcohol substrate. Thus the initial rate is >0. A “negative” initial rate in alcohol substrate indicates that the overall reaction favours the consumption of alcohol, i.e., oxidation of the alcohol substrate occurs. To evaluate the reliability of the initial rate constant, the standard deviation of the first order exponential fit of alcohol contents were used to calculate the error margins of the initial rates with a very conservative confidence interval. The initial rates also obtained from the equal concentration experiments were plotted against the experimental ΔG° value in order to visualize a potential relationship (Fig. 6 ). A linear regression was calculated for both ruthenium catalysts giving a correlation factor, R 2, of 0.92 and 0.89 respectively. As the much faster oxidation of the secondary alcohols leading to the thermodynamically favoured α, β-unsaturated ketone shows, there clearly is a correlation between the thermodynamic driving force of the transfer dehydrogenation reactions and their relative rates. As the graphs in Fig. 6 suggest the correlation between the initial rates and ΔG° values is in fact linear, however no linear relationship between the logarithms of the rate constants and ΔG° values – as would be expected for a classic linear free enthalpy relationship – was found and at present we have no theoretical model to explain these results."
14,Conclusions,"The oxidation of aliphatic and cyclic secondary alcohols in acetone solvent by Noyori type η6-arene N-tosyl 1,2-diaminoethane based ruthenium(II) complexes with degradation resistant ligands proceeds only slowly and in low yield when compared to the reverse reduction reaction. The 16-electron amide complex is the resting state under oxidizing conditions and the 18-electron hydride complex under reducing conditions. A coordinative inhibition of the Ru or NH moiety of acetone solvent in an η1-or η2-fashion does not exist based on NMR and IR experiment evidence and is not the cause for the lower reactivity under oxidizing condition. The correlation of the initial rates of the alcohol consumption or alcohol production with the ΔG° of the participating alcohol/ketone pair gives an approximately linear relationship. The slope of this relationship is dependent on the catalyst employed. A possible explanation for the lower activity of the catalysts under oxidizing conditions compared to reducing condition is that there is a relatively high barrier of activation associated with the rearrangement of the 16-electron complex to a conformation required for hydrogen transfer and formation of the 18-electron hydride complex. Under oxidizing conditions, i.e., in excess ketone solvent, this formation of the 18-electron hydride complex becomes the rate determining step, while under reducing conditions, i.e., in excess alcohol solvent, the rate determining step occurs between the ketone substrate and the hydrogen loaded complex. Thus even though the overall reaction is a genuine equilibrium, the presence of two distinct active catalysts for the forward and reverse reactions gives rise to distinct reaction pathways with different activation barriers explaining the marked differences in reactivity in oxidation vs. reduction hydrogen transfer reactions. This difference in reactivity as well as an apparent inverse correlation between the initial rates of oxidation with the ΔG reaction for hydrogen transfer reactions under oxidizing conditions, also renders the Noyori type system unsuitable for the catalytic synthesis of α-hydroxy-ketones from vicinal diols."
