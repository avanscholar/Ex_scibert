0,Introduction,"Due to the exponential global increase in population, the day-to-day activities of humans continue to threaten mother earth mainly through the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). However, if corrective and preventive measures are not taken towards the production and use of fossil-fuel-based energy, the whole of mankind will be endangered on this planet earth. For instance, global primary energy demand is projected to reach about 20 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (BTOE) by 2040 [1], of which approximately 70 % will be derived from fossil fuels (main sources of anthropogenic CO2). Currently, this is unavoidable as we are a few decades away from transitioning fully into noncarbon-based renewable energy. Yet, continuous dependence on fossil fuels as the main source of primary energy could raise the average global temperature above 2 °C (compared to the preindustrial era, 1800–1900 AD). The aim is to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 °C (Paris Agreement) by having stringent control over CO2 (and other GHGs) emission, setting the goal towards low carbon to zero carbon emission. Global CO2 emission (energy-related) has been estimated to grow at a rate of 0.6 % per annum from 2018 through 2050, albeit, this projection is not globally distributed [2]. As depicted in Fig. 1 , it appears that the future contribution to increasing energy-related emissions of CO2 would mainly come from the non-member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This is because CO2 emission will apparently flatten from 2020 to 2050 for OECD member countries. Global energy and carbon intensities for both OECD and non-OECD countries will continue to decline through 2050. Although, non-OECD countries would use less fossil fuel-derived energy to generate economic activities (i.e. less energy-intensive, relative to OECD countries), however, they are expected to generate more CO2 emissions per unit of energy consumed [2]. This is a clear disparity in carbon and energy intensities, which reflects the difference in fuel mix (renewable and non-renewable) utilized for energy production by both types of countries. In order to mitigate further carbon emission, and keep the average global rise in temperature below 2 °C by the end of this century, two postcapturing applications of CO2 including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) have been proposed [3], focusing on utilizing CO2 as an alternative chemical feedstock in industrial processes. At this stage, no further compromise on the preservation of the environment in a bid to build a sustainable society where major chemical reactions and energy productions are sought from renewable energies (i.e. solar, nuclear, wind, tidal) towards attaining a low carbon future. To date, there still remains a significant gap between the net consumption of carbon-based products from CO2 hydrogenation and the overall emission of CO2. It is very crucial to continually search for eco-friendly, efficient, and economical strategies to capture and transform CO2 (both from atmospheric and industrial use) into fuels and chemicals. In this regard, alternatives have been proposed to effectively utilize renewable carbon resources, in a bid to mitigate CO2 emissions and produce value-added chemicals, while maintaining the sustainable development of our society. Although CO2 molecule is inert, research and development (R&D) efforts have shown that it can be reduced by catalytic conversion to value-added products which can serve as hydrogen storage materials and feedstocks for the syntheses of hydrocarbons and their derivatives (methanol, dimethyl ether, lower olefins, etc.) [4,5]. Thus, it becomes very important to synthesize active, selective, and intrinsically stable catalysts, as well as gaining an insightful understanding of CO2 transformation in various catalytic environments. This has driven research efforts towards the efficient and commercializable conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals, via various techniques. In the literature of catalytic CO2 valorization, the transformation of CO2 can be achieved on either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Attempts have been made to use various homogeneous catalysts including frustrated Lewis pairs, transition metal complexes, and N-heterocyclic carbenes with good activity towards CO2 reduction [6,7]. Meanwhile, it is accompanied by a low process economy and complicated catalyst/product separation process. Currently, research efforts on CO2 reduction on heterogeneous catalysts are focused on thermal, electrochemical, photochemical, biochemical, and plasma techniques [8]. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 clearly offers advantages over other processes such as environmental benignity, mild operating conditions, and easy control of reaction rates. Also, considering that the required H2 typically comes from water, it is better than thermal reduction where pressurized molecular H2 is required. However, this method appears limited by the high cost of electricity, which must be generated from renewable sources (i.e. hydrothermal, geothermal, solar wind, etc.) [9]. In addition, the electrochemical approach is suitable for limited CO2 conversion, and the production of fine chemicals, coupled with notably lower efficiency compared to the H2 evolution rate [10]. Research interest is also rising in the photochemical reduction of CO2, where visible light harvested from the sun is employed to generate photo-exited electrons and holes for the reduction process, in the presence of semiconducting materials (i.e. oxides, sulfides, phosphides) [8]. This process, although has the advantage of utilizing readily available solar energy, suffers from low process efficiency, hence, industrial commercialization is largely constrained. The biochemical method offers an eco-friendly approach to produce carbon-based chemicals from CO2 reduction. Meanwhile, it suffers from the high cost of catalysts and co-factor [11]. More so, the plasma-assisted catalytic approach to CO2 reduction continues to gain increasing research attention. The process is capable of solving the challenges involved with CO2 activation, owing to its inertness [12]. The process most commonly uses dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) with plasma catalysis to improve conversion efficiency and enhance selectivity to target value-added products, in a non-equilibrium environment [12]. In the midst of the advantages, there is a trade-off between energy and conversion efficiency. The thermochemical process is the conventional technique for converting CO2 by hydrogenation to a wide variety of products (alkanes, alkanes, methanol, dimethyl ether, formic acid etc.), over a solid catalyst, and in the presence of heat energy. The global lower olefin market is expected to reach $ 475.5 million by the end of 2027 (5.85 % compounded annual growth rate, CAGR). This is due to the shifting focus of consumers towards plastic goods and cosmetics [13]. Lower olefins (i.e. ethylene, propylene, butylene, and 1, 3-butadiene), are vital chemicals used as a building block for many petrochemical products (rubbers, synthetic textiles, plastics, cumene, styrene, butadiene rubber, etc.) [14]. Specifically, ethylene and propylene are the two topmost petrochemical products in the world [15], with global consumption of 150 and 100 million metric tons (yr. 2007), respectively. They are projected to increase by about 22 and 14 %, respectively, by the end of 2022 [16]. On this basis, the synthesis of C2-C4 = olefins is perhaps the most promising pathway to utilize CO2 via hydrogenation. Currently, the cracking of hydrocarbons is the main source of industrial lower olefin supply. In CO2 chemical utilization via hydrogenation, it is crucial to ensure that hydrogen is sustainably produced from renewable feedstock (for instance, water and biomass) and energy (i.e. solar, wind, hydrothermal), to avoid jeopardizing the main focus of atmospheric CO2 emission mitigation. Photochemical water splitting for hydrogen production offers simplistic technology with almost zero-emission, albeit, energy efficiency is low (11 %), and cost of H2 is high (10 $/kg H2) [17]. Other technologies involving low emission of CO2 including water electrolysis, biomass conversion, ammonia decomposition, etc., are also viable alternatives for hydrogen production [18–20]. Amidst all, R&D efforts must be focused on improving the development of economic, environmental-friendly, and efficient green hydrogen production technologies. CO2 plays a vital role in the carbon cycle (natural and artificial). CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins (henceforth represented as CTLO), is a promising route to utilize renewable carbon resources which can be sourced from chemical recycling of already existing plastics, various types of biomass, and fossil fuel point sources [21]. However, it requires R&D efforts in the area of rational design of catalysts. The “breakthrough catalyst” must be able to solve challenges such as CO2 inertness, activation of the CC coupling barrier, and fine-tuning reaction conditions favorable to the two-step reactions involved in CTLO (separate or simultaneous). A detailed understanding of structure-activity correlations between catalytic active sites and various reaction intermediates will guide the rational design of an optimal catalyst for the reaction process. In the “ensemble-size” model, for instance, the rate of reaction relates to the likelihood of locating an ensemble of n free and neighboring atoms on which reactants can adsorb and further transform to target products (via active intermediates species). These atoms must be arranged in a certain geometry, that will endow the catalyst with the required active sites [22,23]. According to Sabatier’s principle, the electronic effects governing the heat of adsorption of reactants and products should neither be too strong nor weak in order to give optimum coverage of competing species at the catalysts surface, coupled with product desorption [24]. The electronic and geometric properties of catalysts must be tuned via various strategies including the creation of oxygen vacancies, defect sites, doped-heteroatoms, etc. in a bid to generate a unique morphology/topology capable of exposing more active sites and stabilizing active intermediates for improved catalytic performance. There are good numbers of review articles already published on the hydrogenation of CO2, many of which focused on a different range of features including, but not limited to reaction mechanism and catalytic performance towards paraffin hydrocarbons [25], aromatics [26], and light olefins [27,28]. However, the review on CTLO reaction focusing on the understanding of structural-activity relationships of representative catalysts is absent in the literature. Yet, it very desirable towards optimizing the existing catalysts or rational design of scalable novel ones, with high performance, low cost, and intrinsic stability. Herewith, we systematically review advances in structural and electronic properties of different types of heterogeneous catalysts for CTLO reaction via various strategies which affect the catalytic performance. A breakthrough in this field of knowledge will not only help to mitigate CO2 emission but also contribute to the production of sustainable energy in the mid-term future."
1,CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins (C2-C4 =),"The hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons can be achieved directly over a standalone catalyst or via a tandem catalyst. Herewith, the “tandem” term is broadly used to indicate a combination of zeolites with either Fe-based Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalyst or metal oxides-based methanol synthesis catalyst. Regardless of the routes, it has been observed that catalytic properties and reaction conditions can be tuned to achieve various product distributions (light/heavy olefins, paraffin, aromatics, etc.). In the first approach, CO2 is converted to CO via reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction at equilibria, over a standalone catalyst, followed by subsequent transformation of CO to hydrocarbon products via FTS in a multi-step process [29,30]. This approach is henceforth designated as CO2 modified-FT process. In the tandem approach, CO2 is converted to CO or methanol over a hydrogenation catalyst, followed by further transformation of methanol to hydrocarbons over a zeolite catalyst. This sequence of processes can be achieved in separate reactors or coupled in a single reactor. A two-steps process was also investigated for olefin synthesis where CO2-FT catalyst hydrogenates CO2 to a wide range of hydrocarbon products (via CO intermediate), which then routed through a downstream zeolite catalyst bed for product redistribution. In the integrated one-step process, the synthesis of methanol and methanol dehydration reactions occurs simultaneously in a single reactor where a single catalyst exhibiting bifunctional properties is present. CO2 is mostly hydrogenated to methanol (via methanol-mediated route), followed by methanol conversion to olefins (MTO) on the bifunctional active sites [31]. Recent R&D activities are leaning towards this integrated single-step CTLO process, as the MTO process is already established and practiced as a commercial process by using suitable zeolite (SAPO-34/ZSM-5). The concomitant production of methanol and olefins in a single step eradicates the accumulation of methanol in the reactor. The buildup of methanol in the reaction system will hinder the CO2 conversion due to thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus, the single-step CTLO process can achieve high conversion of CO2. More so, both reaction steps occurring synchronously are favorable from the economic point of view, as only one reactor is required [32,33]. The most challenging aspect of CTLO reaction in a single-step process (single reactor) is the conflicting temperature requirement of the two synchronous reactions. CO2 is inert and requires high temperature for its activation, consequently limited by thermodynamics at elevated temperature (≥ 350 °C). The presence of an efficient catalyst can help to alleviate the thermodynamic barrier by favorably shifting CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction equilibrium. It has been widely accepted via experimental and theoretical studies that, depending on the nature of catalyst (i.e. different activation energy barriers), CO2 hydrogenation to methanol follows either the formate or RWGS pathways, with the former being preferable [34,35]. At a high-temperature regime, the formation of CO via competing RWGS is inevitable (CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O; ΔH° = +41.3 kJ/mol), and increases with increasing reaction temperature [36]. However, this temperature region is more feasible for olefin formation due to the rapid kinetics of CC bond formation at elevated temperatures. The conflict in operating conditions can be partially resolved by adding CO to the CO2/H2 feed mixture to mitigate the thermodynamic barrier at a high temperature. Martín et al. [37] reported that stepwise addition of CO to CO2/H2 mixture led to in situ generations of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of bulk In2O3 catalyst, and consequently boosted methanol space-time yield. Moreover, CO in the feed can influence the chemical equilibrium of CO2 hydrogenation, inhibiting RWGS, consequently shifting towards more favorable products."
2,Modified-Fischer Tropsch pathway for CO2 conversion,"2.1 Modified-Fischer Tropsch pathway for CO2 conversion A number of modified-FT catalysts have been reported to effectively catalyze the CTLO process, ranging from the Fe, Cu, and Co-based, over appropriate metal-oxide supports (Table 1 ). The most studied catalytic materials for the CTLO process using this route is Fe-based catalyst (α-Fe, Fe3O4, α-Fe2O3 etc.), perhaps due to their known performance in FTS and water gas shift (WGS) reactions [14]. It has been proclaimed that, during the CO2 to olefins reaction, different facets of iron-oxides can undergo electronic modification to form new phases that are endowed with properties capable of catalyzing both the formation of CO and its subsequent hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. For instance, some investigations reported Fe3O4 as the active phase for the RWGS step, and iron carbide (Fe5C2) as the active phase for the FTS step [38,39]. Attempts were made to investigate different supporters and promoters to enhance the performance of Fe-based catalysts, but unfortunately yielding mainly large hydrocarbons, with low selectivity to lower olefins in hydrocarbon products, and also suffered from the competing CO side product formation. The theory of Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) is normally used to describe the distribution of products in the FTS process. In the ASF theory, C—C chain growth (i.e. α-factor) indicates the probability that CO/CO2 atom molecule will react to extend the hydrocarbon chain, depending on the types of catalysts and reaction operating conditions [27]. It is crucial to note that switching from CO/H2 feed to CO2/H2 will notably change the product distribution, hence, all catalysts may ideally not follow the ASF product distribution theory [40,41]. It is important to note that the α-factor is normally not reported in CTLO studies. Instead, catalytic data are typically presented in terms of CO2 conversion, space-time yield, hydrocarbon product distribution, CO selectivity, and olefin to paraffin (O/P) ratio. These performance metrics vary depending on the nature of the catalyst (standalone or tandem), and operating conditions (pressure, temperature, H2/CO2 ratio, and space velocity). Primarily, the CTLO process aims to optimize the selectivity to C2-C4 = olefins, suppress the formation of CO, and minimize the production of methane. The most common choice of catalytic data representation is summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . The following sub-sections discussed the effect of supports and promoters and mechanisms for modified FT route. 2.1.1 Supports Support materials for FT-modified pathway include metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), nitrogen-doped carbon, which are capable of improving the heat and mass transfer properties because of their beneficial structures [27]. Fe over these supports with meso/macroporous structure can form active surface species capable of inducing electronic properties that enhance its catalytic performance. Amongst the metal-oxide supports, it appears that ZrO2 is the most active, due to their high surface basicity, which typically favors improved adsorption of CO2 at the reaction condition. This is also the same for CeO2, as it possesses redox property, capable of modifying catalytic properties in the absence of promoters, thereby facilitating the reduction of FeOx species into active phases [42]. Carefully controlled morphologies of ceria support (nanoparticles, nanocubes) promote the formation of olefins, relative to nanorod ceria. Ceria rod selectively exposes (110) and (100) surface planes, endowing its surface with higher oxygen concentration compared to (111) and (100) facets of ceria nanoparticles and the (100) facet of ceria cubes [42,43], which underlies the FeOX reduction to the desired phase. More so, support materials such as metal-organic framework (MOF) have been investigated for the CTLO process due to their high surface area and large pore volumes [44]. Gupta et al. [45] developed carbon-coated Fe-based core-shell nanocatalysts, where an increasing amount of carbon on the shell decreased the O/P ratio. The amount of graphitic carbon coating can affect the diffusion path of reactants, intermediates, and products within the core-shell framework, consequently affecting the production of olefins. The authors attributed the presence of a partially graphitized shell and optimum content of Fe3O4 and χ-Fe5C5 to be accountable for the excellent catalytic performance. In a study by Wu et al., novel honeycomb structured graphene (HSG) exhibited slightly better catalytic performance than reduced graphitic oxide (rGO). The 3-dimensional HSG architecture effectively dissipated heat of reaction, owing to the confined size of iron carbide nanoparticle at high temperature. The structure also hindered the agglomeration of iron carbide nanoparticles, albeit, high methane selectivity (28 %) was observed [46]. 2.1.2 Promoters The addition of alkali metal promoters to the bulk of the active metal component of catalysts is a very popular strategy to improve catalytic performance for FTS reaction. Ideally, doping active Fe-based catalyst with alkali promoters could induce the electronic and structural effects on Fe, thereby improving the adsorption of CO2 molecules and consequent enhancement of C2-C4 = olefin production [46]. For instance, the addition of K+ to Fe2O3 effectively hindered further adsorption of olefins, thereby inhibiting the hydrogenation of the double bond and production of saturated hydrocarbons, owing to truncation of chain growth mechanism [47]. More so, the type of promoter used can affect the formation of iron-carbide, which is typically responsible for driving the FTS reaction step. For example, K, Cs, and Rb significantly accelerated the transformation of FeOx to Fe5C2, relative to Li and Na [48], and shows enhanced olefin production. The presence of potassium (K) promoter in Fe-supported HSG (honeycomb-structured graphene) catalyst assisted the formation of a honeycomb unique structure that endowed the catalysts surface with a stable and abundant mount of Fe5C2 phase. Hence, improved CO2 conversion and high selectivity to light olefins were observed, compared to unprompted catalyst [46]. The presence of K dopant in the vicinity of distinctive honeycomb structure changed the electron density of Fe-species, consequently weakening the CO chemical bond and strengthening Fe-C bond which accounts for the acceleration in iron carbide (active site) formation, and benefited the olefin production [48]. Gascon et al. reported that K promotion to Fe catalysts can simultaneously activate the CO2 and increase the selectivity towards olefins. They have investigated K-promoted red mud (6.4, 14.3, 15, 0.1, 2.1 wt % of Fe, Na, Al, K, Ca, respectively) as a potential catalyst for CO2 valorization. The unpromoted red mud delivered light olefin selectivity of 15 % at 375 °C, relative to 22, 30, 36 % selectivity with K-promotion of 0.25, 1, and 2 wt%, respectively [49]. The same research group utilized high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) to show the image of Fe2O3@K2CO3 catalyst after the reaction, revealing Fe nanoparticles (200–350 nm) being surrounded by thick layers of carbonaceous potassium (K) [50]. In addition, they clearly observed the redistribution of Fe atoms on the surface of the K atoms (Fig. 2 a), which possibly favored the CO2 activation enhancement ability of K. The optimal composition of Fe2O3@K2CO3 enabled the conversion of CO2, delivering up to 44 %, with total olefin (C2-C10) selectivity of ∼ 62 % at 350 °C and 30 bar. Beyond alkali metals, Chernavskii et al. investigated Cu as a promoter for Fe-based catalysts. They observed that Cu promotion facilitated the dispersion of Fe particles, reduction of FeOx, and carbidization to form Hägg iron carbide [51]. Although, it is crucial to note that Cu promotes the selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbon, relative to other promoters (i.e. K, Zn, Mn, etc.). One of the most important metrics to tune during the design of Fe-Cu bimetallic catalyst is the Cu/Fe ratio. For instance, adding 10 wt% Cu to K-promoted Fe/Al2O3 raised CO2 conversion from 24 % to 41 % [52], and slightly increased the O/P ratio from 4.3 (without Cu) to 4.9 (with Cu and K promotion) at 20 bar, 300 °C, and 15.6 mL/min GHSV, without notable alteration of the catalytic structure and crystallinity. The selectivity to C2-C5 hydrocarbon reached up to 79 % for unpromoted catalyst and 88 % for catalyst with 10 wt% Cu promotion. Although, as the concentration of Cu was increased to 30 wt%, O/P ratio decreased to 4.1. SEM-EDX analysis revealed that as Cu content increased beyond 10 wt%, a Cu-rich layer grew stronger than Fe, indicating Cu-rich layer coating on the bulk iron oxides. Also, increasing the concentration of Cu (as a promoter) creates some phase separation effect. Cu is only miscible in iron oxide (Fe3O4) inverse spinel phase up to ∼ 10 %, beyond that, it begins to migrate out of the lattice, under CO2 hydrogenation reaction condition [53]. Recently, Chaipraditgul et al. reported that the addition of 2.6 wt% Cu to Fe/K-Al2O3 slightly increased CO2 conversion from 34 to 36 % at 20 bar, 340 °C, and 75 mL/min GHSV [54]. In contrast to the former report [52], the O/P ratio of unpromoted Fe/K-Al2O3 notably decreased from 6.7 to 5.4 for Cu-promoted Fe/K-Al2O3 catalyst. The authors attributed this decrease in O/P ratio (upon Cu addition) to a higher surface concentration of weakly adsorbed H on the catalyst surface, which promoted further hydrogenation of olefin to paraffin products. Comparing both reports, different Cu loading content in the Fe/K-Al2O3 prepared via different synthesis conditions could have induced different electronic behavior of the prepared catalysts, hence showing the variation in catalytic performance. Besides, both experiments were conducted at different operating conditions (most especially temperature and GHSV). In another investigation by Zhang et al., Zn addition to Fe catalyst led to the formation of ZnO phase and ZnFe2O4 spinel phase, thereby increasing Fe-Zn interaction and altered the adsorption behavior of CO2. More so, excessive Zn promotion (i.e. Zn/Fe of 1:5) can decrease CO2 conversion, while increasing the amount of lower olefins, due to its effective suppression of heavy products [55]. Witoon et al. reported CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins over Fe-Co-Zn/K-Al2O3 (0–1.74 wt% Zn) [56]. With the increase of Zn loading, CO2 conversion and light olefin yield were increased, reaching a maximum of 46.5 and ∼85 %, respectively, for 0.58 wt% Zn loading on Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 catalyst, and a decrease in conversion and yield were observed with a further increase in Zn loading. Meanwhile, the O/P ratio decreased from 5.0 (without Zn promotion) to ∼ 3 (at optimum Zn loading of 0.58 wt%), owing to a similar effect observed with 2.6 wt% Cu doping in Chaipraditgul et al.’s report (i.e. enhancement of olefin hydrogenation to paraffin as a result of a large amount of adsorbed H-atoms) [54,56]. Similar to Zhang et al. [55], XRD analysis of Fe-Co-Zn/K-Al2O3 revealed the formation of ZnFe2O4 which facilitated the reduction of FexOy species to metallic Fe. The addition of appropriate Zn loading content (i.e. 0.58 wt%) possibly enhanced the dispersion of metal/metal oxides and endowed the catalyst surface with a higher number of active sites, consequently improving the hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons via CO2 → CO (RWGS) → Hydrocarbons route. Manganese (Mn) and Chromium (Cr) have also been employed as promoters in CO2 to olefin reaction via CO2 modified-FT pathway. Wang et al. [57] co-precipitated α-Fe2O3 with Mn and Cr promoters (100:5 atomic ratio of Fe to promoters), and observed that a part of the Fe3+ was replaced with Mn3+ and Cr3+, resulting in an active solid solution of FeMn and FeCr. These solids inhibited catalyst reduction, enhanced catalytic stability, and promoted the formation of olefins. In some other reports, sodium was also investigated as a viable promoter, which enhances the basicity of support materials, consequently favoring high selectivity to olefins [58,59]. Liang et al. [60] modulated the structure of Na/Fe (1 wt% Na) by incorporating Mn (0–10 wt%), to access performance towards CTLO reaction. The catalysts were prepared by impregnating Fe3O4 support into aqueous solutions of Mn and Na. Although, as depicted in Fig. 2b, Mn doping showed no significant effect on the conversion of CO2, however, selectivity towards olefin improved (30.2 % C2-C4 = and 42.1 % C5+ optimum over 5Mn-1Na/Fe). This was attributed to the availability of strong Mn-Fe surface species, increased content of Fe5C2 phase, and decreased amount of CO adsorption, which suppressed excessive chain growth reaction. Mn loading amount of 5–10 % accelerated the formation of Fe5C2 phase in H2-reductive environment. In summary, many authors have established that iron-carbide (Fe5C2) species is the active phase in FTS Fe-based catalyst, effectively playing a vital role in C-C chain growth [61]. In addition, it was recently confirmed that the electronic state of surface carbonaceous species was altered by Mn promoter and led to the formation of Fe3C [62]. Tuning the properties of iron carbide species may go a long way to improve the catalytic performance for CTLO. Single and Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) were recently investigated as supports for Fe-K catalysts for CTLO reaction by Wang et al. [63]. While Fe-K/SWCNT (19 wt% Fe) was selective to heavy olefins (C5+, 39.8 %), Fe-K/MCWNT (19.4 wt% Fe) favored the production of light olefins (C2-C4 =, 30.7 %). The difference in light and heavy olefins distribution was attributed to the longer residence time of light olefins over Fe-K/SWCNT, relative to the Fe-K/MWCNT catalyst. This possibly favored more light olefins to undergo chain propagation for heavy olefin production. It can be deduced from the results that the specific surface area of Fe-K/SWCNT (681 m2/g) exceeds that of Fe-K/MWCNT (308 m2/g), which is beneficial for improved dispersion and stabilization of Fe-K/SWCNT active sites at a high reaction temperature, typically required for CTLO reaction. In addition, Fe-K/SWCNT possessed large curvature which benefitted the donation of electrons that facilitated CO bond cleavage, thereby simultaneously promoting the formation of carbon monomer and improved C/H surface ratio, conducive for olefin formation. Reports on the use of cobalt (Co) for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins via the CO2 modified-FT are rare. This could be due to its low RWGS activity compared to its Fe counterpart and/or its low selectivity to paraffin in FTS reaction. In addition to these, Co mostly favors methanation reaction under CO2/H2 reaction regime, consequence inhibiting Fischer Tropsch chain growth [10]. However, it appears that the presence of Co in close proximity with Fe can help to accelerate the formation of CO, which can further go through FT transformation to form C2+ hydrocarbons [64]. Co can act in synergy with K-promoter to improve the overall catalytic activity of Fe-based catalysts towards CO2 hydrogenation to olefins [65]. For instance, doping a small amount of Co (2.6 wt%) in Fe-K/Al2O3 improved the conversion of CO2 [66]. Also, Co doping of 0.53 wt% in Fe-K catalyst showed notable improvement in CO2 conversion (54.6 %), compared to Fe-K catalyst without Co-doping (41.7 %) [64]. In another investigation, Co-Fe/K/Al2O3 catalyst (8.7 wt% K and 0.17 K/F atomic ratio) revealed a decreased amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and improved CO2 adsorption, consequently reducing further hydrogenation of produced olefins [67]. The product selectivity for Fe–Co(0.17)/K(0.3)/Al2O3 as a function of CO2 conversion is shown in Fig. 2c (0.17 and 0.3 represent Co/(Co + Fe), K/Fe atomic ratio, respectively, with Co + Fe fixed at 15 wt%). As CO2 conversion increases, the formation of CO is observed to decrease, owing to its hydrogenation to C2-C4 lower olefins and paraffin. It is possible that some lower olefins could further hydrogenate to paraffin as evidenced by a sharp decrease in the O/P ratio with increasing CO2 conversion. albeit, this depends on the concentration of adsorbed hydrogen atom on the catalyst surface. Research investigations have shown that factors including catalyst design techniques and calcination temperature can be tuned to modulate structural properties. This can lead to enhanced specific surface area, thus more exposed active sites and improved catalytic performance towards the CTLO process. Numpilai et al. [68] accessed the effects of calcination temperature on the structure-activity relationship of Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 catalyst. As calcination temperature increased from 400 to 800 °C, CO2 conversion decreased (49 % to 37.2 %), selectivity to CO increased (9.4–28.9%), with an increase in O/P ratio (6.5–7.6). At a low calcination temperature (400 °C), the catalyst revealed aggregation of spherical particles with the grain size of the bulk catalyst in the range of 10–20 nm. Meanwhile, raising the calcination temperature to 600 °C revealed two different catalyst geometries including a narrow-like structure, formed from the chemical transformation of γ-Al2O3 to δ-Al2O3, and an agglomerated spherical phase of Fe2O3 (Fig. 3 a-d). Calcining the catalysts at temperature > 700 °C revealed nanowire structure, with the highest O/P ratio (7.2). This could be due to the low transformation of δ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3 which facilitated the inclusion of K into the crystal structure of Al2O3 to form KAlO2, showing the pronounced effect of the catalyst structure on its performance. For example, at the lowest calcination temperature (400 °C), the interaction between Fe species and other metal oxides is weak, thus accelerating hydrogenation ability and favoring the formation of saturated hydrocarbons. At appropriate calcination temperature (400–500 °C), Fe-Al2O3 interaction was moderately strong, which consequently reduced the amount of weakly Hads, directly correlated to its high performance towards olefins. Also, the newly in situ generated KAlO2 species produced at around 500 °C could bind hydrogen to the structure to form KAlH4, leading to the lower surface coverage of Hads species, consequently led to higher selectivity to olefins. The same group tuned the interaction of surface adsorbed species over Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 (12.4 wt% Fe, 2.6 wt% Co), to understand the structure-activity relationship [69]. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of calcined 2.5 KFe catalyst (i.e. 2.5 K/Fe atomic ratio) showed an aggregate of nanoparticles. The interaction of K with Fe involved charge transfer to the surface Fe atoms, which consequently favored increased selectivity to olefins. The yield towards light olefins was also increased from 1.82 % to 11.6 % as the K/Fe molar ratio was raised from 0 to 0.5. The addition of K enabled the donation of electrons to Fe species, leading to a strong interaction of H(ads) with the catalyst surface. Concomitantly, the presence of K promoted the abstraction of hydrogen from the catalyst surface, hindering complete hydrogenation and yielding excellent C2-C4 olefin selectivity (C2-C4 = of 46.7 % and O/P ratio of 7.6, over 0.25 K/Fe). Meanwhile, excess of K (i.e. 2.5 K/Fe) notably reduced the specific surface area (i.e. 22 m2/g against 126 m2/g for 0.25 K/Fe), and created a hydrogen deficient environment, eventually decreasing the activity. Wang et al. [70] utilized various preparation techniques including co-precipitation (C), hydrothermal (H) and solvo-thermal (S), to investigate the phase structure, morphology and the adsorption behavior of Fe-Zn/K catalyst (3:1, 2:1, 1:1 Fe/Zn molar ratios). Fe-Zn/K synthesized via hydrothermal method exhibited pores with a narrow neck (50 nm diameter), while co-precipitated sample exhibited a mesoporous structure consisting of loosely assembled coherent particles. On the other hand, the solvo-thermally prepared sample indicated the presence of hollow spherical mesopores (500 nm pore diameter), with nanosheet-like plates, piling up in its vicinity (Fig. 4 a-c). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of solvo- and co-precipitated samples indicated a strong interaction between Fe-oxides and Zn due to the formation of ZnFe2O4 phase, which changed the chemical environment of the molecules on the surface of the catalyst (Zn-Fe interaction). The co-precipitated sample (2Fe-1Zn/K) showed the highest activity at 320 °C, 20 bar (XCO2 = 54.7 %, C2-C4 = selectivity of 47.4 %). The researchers attributed the catalytic performance to its unique structure and small particle diameter. Optimizing Zn/Fe ratio could help to fine-tune the electronic effects, and maximize electron density around the vicinity of Zn, thereby enhancing the formation of ZnFe2O4 phase, consequently improving catalytic behavior. Recently, Dong et al. [71] reported the performance of sodium-promoted FeCo/NC-T (NC represents nitrogen-doped carbon, T represents pyrolysis temperature) for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins. The ZIF-67 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67) derived carbon support helped effectively anchor and disperse metal nanoparticles over it, consequently promoting the reduction and carburization of metal during the reaction, and thereby forming high olefins. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the average particle size of the metal increased. Fe-Co alloy was formed during N2 calcination, which later on converts to active components like Fe3O4 (facilitated by Fe-O connection), Fe5C2, and Co2C in situ (Fig. 4d). At a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C (FeCo/NC-500), HRTEM image showed only the crystal plane of FeCo (110), which is attributable to the destruction of ZIF-67 structure. In addition, the metal nanoparticles produced by the Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) (i.e. ZIF-67) carbonization were enveloped with graphitized carbon, effectively protecting the metal from sintering. FeCo/NC calcined at 400 and 500 °C exhibited CO2 conversion of 48.37 and 47.5 % respectively, higher than at 600 °C (37 %) and 700 °C (35 %). Meanwhile, the selectivity to C2-C4 = olefins was the highest for FeCo/NC-600 (27.1 %). Pyrolysis under low temperature facilitated the formation of iron oxide, thereby providing higher RWGS activity. The small particle size of FeCo/NC (calcined at 400 °C) (8−12 nm according to TEM) benefited the exposure of more active sites, hence higher CO2 conversion and hydrogenation ability, showing the highest CH4 selectivity among the investigated catalysts. 2.1.3 Mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation over modified-FT catalysts Generally, the mechanism of the CTLO process over modified-FT catalysts follows the chain propagation route. Yang et al. [25] described a redox pathway between Fe3 + sites and CO2 molecule, followed by chain propagation via carbide-type mechanism as depicted in Fig. 5 a. In the report, CO2 adsorbs on Fe(II) sites and oxidizes to Fe (III), forming carbonyl group (CO) and oxygen radical on Fe3 + sites. The H2 gas dissociates on the surface nearby the carbonyl surface group to form H radicals which attack the carbonyl C to form formic acid, and later on, formaldehyde or alcohol. In the termination step, hydrogen is abstracted from C-chain, reducing back the Fe-species and forming olefins. Gascon’s group also presented the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation over K-promoted Fe catalyst (i.e. Fe2O3@K2CO3), as shown in Fig. 5b. CO2 in the feed interacts with K on the Fe catalyst to form K2CO3 phase. The new phase then goes through various transformations eventually releasing CO (via KCOOH). Subsequently, CO is transformed to olefins over the active Fe5C2 phase, via the FTS route [50]."
3,Tandem catalysis pathway,"2.2 Tandem catalysis pathway In the previous section, we highlighted the hydrogenation of CO2 via the modified-FT pathway over standalone catalysts, which appears to suffer from wide product distribution. This not only limits the selectivity to targeted olefins, but it is also accompanied by the high cost of product separation. In an attempt to address these challenges, researchers have reported the possibility of using the tandem catalysis strategy [10,72]. The tandem approach is categorized into two; (1) mediated FTS pathway (2) methanol-mediated pathway. The methanol-mediated route comprises of the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, followed by subsequent conversion of methanol to olefin. The first reaction step is exothermic, albeit, accompanied by a parallel undesired endothermic RWGS, where CO is formed (especially at high temperature). The industrial production of methanol employs the use of syngas (CO + H2) as raw materials over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 ternary catalyst at an elevated pressure of 50–100 bar and a temperature range of 250–300 °C [73,74]. The introduction of about 10 % CO2 into the syngas feed, in the presence of the commercial catalyst, can improve the efficiency of the reaction [75]. Besides the industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, the performance of Cu/Zn/ZrO2, PdZn/ZrO2, PdZn/CeO2, Pd/In2O3 etc. have been tested for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [76–80]. For instance, PdZn/CeO2 revealed a CO2 conversion of about 14 % and methanol selectivity close to 100 % at 220 °C, 20 bar, and 2400h−1 space velocity [81]. In the synthesis of lower olefins over tandem catalysts, the production of methanol is usually perceived as an active intermediate that typically migrates to the pores of zeolite channels, where CC coupling takes place [82,83]. During this process, olefin products can further recombine with hydrogen to produce aromatic, paraffin, and higher hydrocarbons. The conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO), developed by UOP/Hydro is typically achieved in the industry over zeolite catalysts (ZSM-5 and SAPO-34). Although, using SAPO-34 for the MTO process, the main product has been reported as ethylene, with low propylene selectivity [84]. Due to this, the methanol-to-propylene (MTP) process was developed by Lurgi for the selective production of propylene over ZSM-5, accompanied with by-products such as fuel gases, liquified petroleum gas, and C5+ gasoline. In the Lurgi MTP process, up to 70 % propylene selectivity is possible when the by-products are recycled [85]. Fundamentally, methanol to olefin is conducted at high temperatures (400–450 °C), where the reaction is thermodynamically favorable [31]. Unfortunately, at this high temperature, CO2 hydrogenation favors the production of CO via RWGS, instead of methanol. Therefore, a compromise of the reaction temperature is required, to ensure that CO formation via RWGS is suppressed, while olefin production is maximized. This compromise is typically achieved at a temperature ≥ 350 °C. The same is true for the addition of CO to the CO2/H2 feed which increases the conversion of feed, owing to the formation of carbonylated surface intermediates during the reaction and the suppression of the RWGS reaction. Recently, attempts have been made to develop high-temperature methanol synthesis catalysts capable of increasing methanol yield at a temperature regime typical of MTO reaction (i.e. ≥ 350 °C), while effectively suppressing CO yield [86,87]. Ideally, at such an increasingly high reaction temperature, there would normally be a monotonous reduction of methanol selectivity. In an attempt to solve this conundrum, Temvuttirojn et al. investigated a series of ZnOx/ZrO2 catalysts at a varying calcination temperature of ZrO2 support (600–1000 °C) and observed a striking correlation amongst phases, adsorption properties, and calcination temperatures [87]. The incorporation of Zn into the lattice of ZrO2 support forming ZnO-ZrO2 solid solution (the main active phase, Zn-O-Zr) was revealed by XRD analysis, which was then correlated to the catalytic performance. The Zn-O-Zr was maximized for 15ZnZr-600 catalyst (15 wt% Zn, 600 °C calcination temperature) at the lowest tested temperature of 300 °C, delivering ∼ 75 % methanol selectivity. The authors attributed this performance to the weakly bonded Zn-O-Zr to CO2, which facilitated selective methanol production. As reaction temperature increases, the methanol selectivity for this catalyst showed a notable decrease. However, increasing the calcination temperature of ZrO2 (700–1000 °C) significantly reduced the weak adsorption of CO2, consequently enhancing methanol selectivity at high reaction temperature, due to the stabilized adsorbed species that hydrogenated to methanol. In their work, methanol selectivity was maximized for 15ZnZr-700 (67.5 %), 15ZnZr-800 (55.8 %), 15ZnZr-900 (39.6 %), 15ZnZr-1000 (25.6 %), and 15ZnZr-1000 (15.4 %), at reaction temperatures of 320, 340, 360, 380, and 400 °C, respectively. More so, the same group reported the role of calcination temperature of ZrO2 (600−1000 °C) on the catalytic properties of In2O3/ZrO2 (20 wt% In) towards CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [86]. Catalysts exhibiting weak adsorption to CO2 and H2 (for instance, 20In/Zr-600) only facilitated methane formation, with the observation of suppression of methane formation as the calcination temperature increased. However, catalysts with strong adsorption strength of CO2 and H2 (for Zr calcined at high temperature) improved the formation of methanol at the elevated reaction temperature. The yields of methanol were maximized for 20In/Zr-800 at 320−340 °C, and 20In/Zr-900 at 360−400 °C. The discovery of high-temperature methanol synthesis catalysts will continue to pave way for easy production of lower olefins in a single reactor where simultaneous reactions take place at similar temperature regime. 2.2.1 Methanol-mediated reaction pathway A few research groups have tried to probe the structure and morphology of catalysts in a bid to understand effects on performance towards CTLO, albeit, insufficient. In the subsequent sections, progress on CTLO research focused on the correlation between the catalytic structure and its performance is discussed. 2.2.1.1 Zeolite There are a variety of zeolite structures, ranging from nano-zeolite to hierarchical network. In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, one of the best ways to improve catalytic performance is to increase the number of exposed active sites on the catalyst surface, coupled with the enhanced specific surface area. Ideally, these can be achieved by controlling the particle size and/or introducing the pore system with open paths. A well-defined nano zeolite structure combines properties such as excellent molecular mass transfer and notable Brönsted acid sites, which can effectively improve the performance of the catalytic system. On the other hand, hierarchical assembly is a very efficient method to retain the intrinsic properties of nano-zeolite and provide novel multipurpose systems and functionality in a single structure, owing to their additional meso- and macropores [88]. Conventionally, any zeolite exhibiting 2–50 nm pore diameter in addition to their inherent microporous systems are referred to as hierarchical zeolites [89]. In hierarchical-structured zeolite, there exists a combination of micro, meso and macropores. The micro- and meso pore of uniform size are responsible for driving the shape and size selectivity for guest molecules and improving the interaction between the template (host) and reacting (guest) molecules. Meanwhile, molecular diffusion (owing to a short diffusion path) and easy access to active sites of the acidic material is governed by the macropores [90]. As it is evident from many reaction systems, the major characteristics that control the selectivity and product distribution over hierarchical zeolites are the chemical nature of active sites [88]. Unarguably, the strategies employed in the synthesis of hierarchical zeolite will lead to zeolites of various topologies, pore size, morphology, phase purity of zeolite crystals, etc. R&D activities in the synthesis of lower olefin from CO2 hydrogenation have employed the various structures of zeolite (both nanosized and hierarchical zeolite). García-Hurtado et al. [91] reported that the structural porous channels of zeolite molecular sieve on which active sites are located will determine the type of hydrocarbon(s) that would be produced. For instance, small pore zeotypes and zeolites (3–4 Å), exhibiting large cavities are capable of converting methanol to light olefins [92–94]. The large cavities allow the formation of an intermediate hydrocarbon pool (HCP) and favor the diffusion of light olefins out of small pores, consequently avoiding further oligomerization and cracking. Normally, a high amount of Brønsted acid sites (i.e. more aluminous zeolite) will favor oligomerization and cracking of lower olefins. In fact, when the Si/Al ratio is low, there will be more than one Al molecule per zeolite cavity, which has been reported to be correlated with the formation of coke species and rapid deactivation [95,96]. So, a high Si/Al ratio (100–200) zeolite is favorable for this process and is discussed in the following sections. 2.2.1.2 ZSM-5 zeolite There are more than 200 existing zeolite, out of which Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5), remains one of the most studied, with many useful industrial applications. Research on zeolite synthesis continues to greatly improve, with many investigations focusing on cost reduction and the search for environmental benign structural promoters (i.e. templates). A varying topology of ZSM-5 will form zeolites of various surface properties, shapes, and sizes. The presence of a structural defect in zeolites (ZSM-5, H-ZSM5), as Extra-Framework Al species (EFAl), external silanols, Si-OH nests can complicate the detailed understanding of surface catalytic reaction [97]. Losch, et al. [98] synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 (H-ZSM-5) through a fluorine-assisted approach, leaving behind zeolite crystals with no signal of a structural defect, albeit, peaks attributable to bridging Si—OH—Al Brønsted Acid Sites (BAS) were present, which are favorable to the production of olefins from methanol. The structure, size, porosity and mean diffusion path of ZSM-5 can be notably influenced by Si/Al ratio (Fig. 6 ). As the Si/Al ratio increases, the dispersion of acid sites located at the intersection of pore channels increased. The authors indicated that a molecule would have to diffuse through about 6 microporous pore channel intersections of H-ZSM-5FL (i.e. fluorine-assisted with no structural defect) before reaching the next (nearest) acid sites, thus, hindering further reaction and improving selectivity to olefins. In the following section, attempts are made to elucidate the structure, diffusion, and property relationships between metal-oxides and ZSM-5 zeolites active materials for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins. Liu et al. [99] doped K-promoted cobalt oxide into zeolite framework via wetness impregnation and ion exchange (Si/Al in the range of 50–200), to form K-CoOx/HZSM-5. As the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite increases, selectivity towards methane, C2-C4 olefins, and C5+ increased, while CO selectivity decreased. However, for the ion exchange synthesis procedure, product selectivity remained constant with increasing Si/Al ratio, due to the replacement of Brønsted acid sites with K. The selection of zeolite with appropriate topology can assist in stabilizing active intermediates and tune the selectivity towards targeted olefins. Gascon et al. [100] studied the effects of zeolite topology over Fe2O3@KO2/ZSM-5 catalyst (Fe/K molar ratio of 2). Mordernite zeolite (H-MOR) was utilized, which favored the formation of C2H4 (11.5 %) and C2H6 (12.5 %), due to its inactiveness for hydrocarbon cracking. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of magnetic angle spinning method (MAS ssNMR) revealed that methylated olefinic species, zeolite surface formate, and paraffin were trapped inside the post-reacted MOR (Mordenite) zeolite, thereby making hydrocarbon pool as the dominating reaction intermediates. The authors noted that ZSM-5 can more easily activate long alkenes to form carbenium ions which can be further incorporated into the aromatization cycle. However, the MOR zeolite possesses a higher protonation barrier, ensuring that heavy olefin fractions are unchanged. The same group also modified the acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 26) using Ca (3, 6, and 14 wt%), in a bid to enhance olefins production when combined with Fe-K FTS catalyst [101]. The presence of Ca suppressed the formation of aromatics (∼ 4 %), however, Ca in excess (14 wt%) led to a notable loss of activity, due to pore blockage. Doping Ca into the catalyst’s mixture improved the incorporation of CO (via ketene-like intermediate) onto zeolite surface, thereby increasing the amount of active surface acetate intermediate, which was later transformed into light olefin. In addition, Ca appropriately reduced the content of Brønsted acid density of the ZSM-5 zeolite and increased that of Lewis acid, consequently producing more lower olefin, at the expense of longer hydrocarbon chains. Some authors have reported that the use of tandem catalysts comprising of composite metal oxides and ZSM-5 appear to favor the production of aromatics and C5+ hydrocarbons, rather than lower olefins. For instance, a composite ZnAlOx on H-ZSM-5 delivered up to 74 % aromatic hydrocarbon, with ∼ 11 % C2-C4 = olefin selectivity and < 1 % methane among hydrocarbon products (without CO) at 593 K and 30 bar [102]. In another report, bifunctional In2O3/HZSM-5 (2:1 mass ratio) yielded up to 78 % selectivity to C5+ gasoline-range hydrocarbon, owing to the proximity of the two active components (i.e. reducible In2O3 and zeolite), which played the crucial role of suppressing RWGS reaction forming less amount of CO [103]. The ensemble of ZnZrO/ZSM-5 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation delivered up to 73 % aromatics and 4.9 % C2-C4 = at 320 °C and 40 bar [104]. Water formed via CO2 hydrogenation migrated to the H-ZSM-5 pores and promoted the formation of aromatic hydrocarbon. More so, the polycyclic aromatic formation was suppressed, leading to the excellent stability of the catalyst. 2.2.1.3 SAPO-34 zeolite The popularity of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO-34) zeolite continues to grow in many industrial reactions, specifically in the production of olefins from hydrocarbons. SAPO-34 is endowed with chabazite (CHA) cage (∼ 0.94 nm diameter) and a small 8-ring pore opening of about 0.38 nm. It possesses excellent thermal and hydrothermal stability, mild acidity, and external shape–selectivity [105]. The moderate acidity of SAPO-34 typically helps to induce high-selectivity towards light olefins [106]. One of the key backdrops of using SAPO-34 for olefin production (specifically, in MTO) is its propensity to form polymethylbenzenium ions (in situ), which can further transform into organic coke species, accumulating in the narrow channels of the SAPO-34 cavities [84]. Consequently, the active acid sites are blocked, thus limiting its diffusion, and causing rapid deactivation of the active sites for methanol intermediate to lower olefins. Researchers have attempted to solve this problem via the synthesis of nano zeolite and hierarchical zeolite, as they are capable of overcoming the diffusion limitation and coke deactivation [107,108]. Consequently, mass transfer and olefin selectivity are significantly improved. Unarguably, SAPO-34 of different shapes, sizes, and topologies is the most investigated acidic zeolite for CTLO reaction. To a reasonable extent, research investigations focusing on the synthesis of light olefin from CO2 and H2 have tried to employ advanced characterization techniques to probe the structure-property relationships of SAPO-34-based CTLO catalysts. However, there is a need to understand the detailed surface chemistry of interaction between metal-oxide and zeolite components of catalyst. Attempts have been made to synthesize lower olefins from CO2 hydrogenation by employing the synergy of FTS catalysts (promoted and un-promoted) with SAPO-34 zeolite, typically following the FTS pathway (CO via RWGS as active reaction intermediate). Gascon et al. [109] investigated CTLO over coated sulfated zirconia/SAPO-34 (at the bottom of the fixed bed reactor) and Fe2O3/K2O (at the top). Sulfur incorporation into zirconia formed ZrS shell nanoparticle with unique structure, allowing the cracking of C5+ produced on the Fe component of the catalyst at high temperature where conventional zeolite fall short. At 375 °C and 30 bar, CO2 conversion per pass was about 20 %, with C2-C4 = olefin selectivity of 43 % over the un-coated catalyst (Fe2O3@KO2/SAPO-34), while selectivity towards C2-C4 = olefins slightly increased over Fe2O3@KO2-ZrS/SAPO-34 (∼ 50 %). The incorporation of ZrS improved the acidic functionality of SAPO-34 and increased the production of light olefins. Also, the influences of zeolite structure and crystal size on the performance towards CTLO were accessed, using beta (BEA, 6.5−7 Å), Mobil-Five (MFI, 5–5.5 Å) and CHA (3.5 Å) zeolite topologies [91]. The type of surface reaction occurring in various zeolite topologies differs, due to various morphology, size, and synthesis techniques. The particle size of zeolites and their nano-sized counterparts were evaluated by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), and shown in Fig. 7 a-c. The reduction of particle size for nanosized zeolites (i.e. 10−15 nm n-BEA, 50−70 nm n-CHA, and 10−15 nm n-MFI) increased lower olefin selectivity, compared to the zeolite with larger crystals (30–40, 200 and 200–300 nm for BEA, MFI and CHA, respectively). As depicted in Fig. 7d, K/Fe3O4-MFI maximizes aromatics, while K/Fe3O4-CHA and BEA favored the production of C1 - C4 fraction, with high olefins selectivity. Shorter inter-crystalline diffusion paths facilitated the emergence of lower olefins before being involved in consecutive oligomerization reactions. This indicates that the reduction of zeolite particle size allowed large FTS products to access active sites, thus modifying the complex set of consecutive reactions, and consequently influencing product distribution. It is crucial to mention that controlling the crystal size of the zeolite framework will enhance the accessibility of FTS products to the inner structure of the zeolite but may increase the selectivity of reaction occurring on the external surface of the zeolite crystal or at the pore mouth. More so, metal-oxides (In2O3, ZrO2, CeO2) together with SAPO-34 zeolite have been used for CTLO reaction, where the former ideally catalyzes the hydrogenation of CO2 to either methanol or CO intermediate, and the subsequent formation of olefin occurs on the zeolite component. While some investigations have strategically created beds of both catalytic components separately (SAPO-34 is placed downstream of the metal-oxide catalyst), other research reports employ hybrid catalyst with both active components interacting simultaneously. For example, Ghasemi et al. [110] reported the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol over NiCu/CeO2 (17 % CO2 conversion), followed by in-situ synthesis of lower olefins of up to 77 % selectivity over porous SAPO-34 zeolite. The surface of NiCu/CeO2-SAPO-34 hybrid catalyst revealed irregular crystals, indicating that the addition of NiCu/CeO2 altered the regular cubic geometry of SAPO-34, thereby favoring the production of lower olefins. More so, Numpilai et al. [111] correlated the performance of hybrid In2O3/SAPO-34 catalyst towards CO2 to olefins with its phases and structures. The hybrid catalyst delivered a CO2 conversion and C2-C4 = olefin selectivity of 28.2 and 70 %, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that In2O3 particles are spherical in shape with some coalescence, possessing particle size distribution in the range of 10–20 nm (Fig. 8 a). In addition, TEM showed In2O3 nanoparticles with well-defined lattice fringes of 0.292 nm corresponding to (222) plane of In2O3. The high olefins selectivity is attributable to closely attached In2O3 to the external surface of SAPO-34, which is pivotal for fast diffusion of methanol intermediate into SAPO-34 pores. Tan et al. [112] reported hybrid catalysts consisting of metal oxides and acidic zeolite components, which couples two successive processes into the direct synthesis of lower olefins, as shown in Fig. 8b. Among a series of hybrid catalysts tested for the reaction, In2O3/ZrO2-SAPO-34 exhibited the highest selectivity to light olefin (∼ 43 %), and fairly high CO2 conversion (∼ 36 %), followed by Zn-Cr/SAPO-34. However, Cu and Ga-containing hybrid catalysts showed no activity for lower olefins production (Fig. 8c). In2O3/ZrO2 possesses weak hydrogenation ability which could hinder light olefins formed on SAPO-34 sites to further hydrogenate to paraffin. Hence, higher olefins selectivity compared to other hybrid catalysts. Also, the excellent selectivity can be attributed to strong CO2 adsorption to defective indium oxide and zirconia which created a large energy barrier that suppressed CO2 dissociation to CO. It could be that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the catalyst is due to the presence of a high concentration of anionic vacancies on both oxide surfaces. This exposes In3+ and Zr3+ vacancies acting as Lewis acid centers and enhances the Brønsted acidity of the adjacent Zr/In-OH group (initial precursor to methanol). In another investigation by Li et al., CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO/SAPO-34 catalyst exhibited close to 90 % lower olefins selectivity among hydrocarbon products, and low CO selectivity (∼ 45 %) [31]. The performance of the catalyst as a function of ZnZrO2 and SAPO-34 proximity, in a fixed bed reactor, is shown in Fig. 9 a. The spatial separation between the two active components leads to changes in selectivity to CO and lower C2-C4 = olefins. As spatial distance increases, the selectivity to lower olefins decreased, and CO became the dominant product. Hence, the excellent selectivity to lower olefins exhibited by ZnZrO2/SAPO (shown as I in Fig. 9a) can be attributed to an effective synergistic effect, with both sites intimately contacting. The investigation revealed that the catalyst can facilitate thermo-kinetic coupling through transfer and migration of CHxO intermediate species (i.e. CH3Oads, CHOads, and CH3OH) to the zeolite site (Fig. 9b). Spinel-type mixed oxides have been used in a variety of catalytic reactions, including CO2 to lower olefins (CTLO), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), etc. The typical structure of spinel oxide (8 tetrahedral plus 4 octahedral sites per unit), has its oxygen anions appropriately distributed cubic closed-packing, and cations’ distribution in the interstice between the oxygen ions [113]. The distribution of cations among the spinel structure ultimately determines its catalytic physiochemical properties. Liu et al. [114] used the spinel structure of ZnGa2O4 with SAPO-34 via mortar mixing, generating particles with appropriate proximity, thereby revealing O/P up to 8, with olefin selectivity >80 % at 350–400 °C. The conversion of CO2 was the highest for Zn/Ga (1:2) in either Zn-Ga-O or Zn-Ga-O/SAPO-34 spinel series. According to TEM analysis, the mean size of ZnGa2O4 spinel was about 7 nm with a narrow distribution, favoring the catalytic performance due to small particle size, Zn-Ga synergy and oxygen-defects (Fig. 10 a). It appeared that the push of methanol to olefins drives more CO2 conversion to methanol (ensuring that methanol is continuously available for transformation during the process), thus giving little room for CO production. The investigators assumed -Ga-O- and -Zn-O- pairs to favor the activation of H2, which allowed the generation of adsorbed H species for CO2 activation to methoxides (CH3Oads). The adsorbed methoxide went through further hydrogenation to methanol, followed by its selective dehydration to C2-C4 olefins (via dimethyl ether) in the SAPO-34 cages (Fig. 10b). Recently, the same research group reported the ability of spinel structured ZnAl2O4 and SAPO-34 to efficiently hydrogenate CO and CO2 to lower olefins, with Zn in the structure playing a crucial role in CO2 conversion [115]. Zn/Al ratio of 1:2 exhibited the highest CO2 conversion (15 % at 643 K) and C2-C4 olefin selectivity (87 %). However, excessive Zn/Al ratio resulted in over-hydrogenation of lower olefins to paraffin, probably due to the addition of extra Al in the spinel. HRTEM image of ZnAl2O4 (Fig. 10c) showed lattice fringes that are attributable to (220), (311), (400), and (511) facets of ZnAl2O4 spinel, indicating the formation of small particles composed of small spinel, and are dispersed on SAPO-34 crystallite in the catalyst (Fig. 10d). The structure-performance correlation of Zn-based spinel catalyst suggested that the oxygen vacant sites and surface -Zn-O- domain contributed to the hydrogenation of CO2 by facilitating CO2/H2 activation. The choice of structure-directing agent for zeolite synthesis, nature of raw materials, and Si/Al ratio tend to determine the particle size, topology, and physicochemical properties of the target zeolites. The use of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) template appears to be the best in directing the synthesis of small-sized SAPO-34, with favorable performance towards lower olefins selectivity. Even though TEAOH as a template is not economical for industrial use, researchers have employed strategies involving the introduction of other low-cost templates, to form bi- or tri-templating agents, without compromising the quality of the final zeolite [105]. Wang et al. [33] employed CuO-ZnO-kaolin/SAPO-34 molecular sieve to directly catalyze CTLO reaction. The SAPO-34 (kaolin as raw material, designated as Sk) was prepared using the temperature programming method in the presence of trimethylamine as a structure-directing agent. CuO-ZnO (CZ) was uniformly dispersed on the surface of lamellar-structured SAPO-34 (100 nm thickness) of high crystallinity and specific surface area (Fig. 11 a). As the incorporation of Si into the SAPO-34 increases, the distribution of strong acidic sites increases, leading to high selectivity to light olefins for CZ-k/S (65.3 %) and CZ/S (64.9 %). The lamellar structure is typically assembled through the layer-by-layer nucleation method, which endows catalysts with high activity and stability for CO bond hydrogenation [72,116] (Fig. 11b). The time on stream (TOS) data compares the stability of all catalysts, with the CZ-k/Sk exhibiting the best stability, due to the confinement effect which prevented the dissipation of methanol, consequently producing lower olefins (Fig. 11c). For all the catalysts, the yields of C2-C4 olefins were initially high, later on coke began to form, blocking the internal channels of SAPO-34 zeolite, thereby deactivating it, gradually. CZ-k/S exhibited large volume and average pore diameter, which is conducive to heat dissipation, thus preventing quick deactivation caused by local over-heat. In addition, the CZ/Sk and CZ-k/Sk have a strong ability to resist carbon deposition, owing to their lamellar structure, which shortened the diffusion path of intermediate products, preventing the generation of macromolecules from further reactions. Martín et al. [117] investigated CTLO reaction over MOF-derived In-Zr catalyst, in the presence of SAPO-34, CHA zeolite (Si/Al ratio of 15 and 30), and SSZ-39 zeolite (AEI structure). TEM images of MOF-based catalyst synthesized via solvo-thermal method indicated a well-dispersed In2O3/ZrO2 in the (In-Zr)MOF/CHA relative to In-Zr/CHA synthesized via physical mixture. (In-Zr)MOF/CHA30 exhibited the highest CO2 conversion per pass at reaction temperature > 425 °C and 30 bar, albeit, comparable conversion at low temperatures. MOF-based samples promoted CO2 hydrogenation into CHxO intermediate that further migrated to nearby strong Brønsted acid sites of CHA to form hydrocarbons. As depicted in Fig. 12 a, In-Zr/ CHA30 and (In-Zr)MOF/CHA30 at 375 °C revealed olefins selectivity of 73 and 87 %, respectively, with O/P ratio maximized at about 8. This indicates the importance of strong acidity in the conversion of methanol intermediate to lower olefins and avoiding the accumulation of oxygenated intermediates in the zeolite pores. This can be interpreted to mean that CHA zeolite allows MTO at a slightly lower temperature than SAPO zeotypes. The (In-Zr)MOF/CHA30 catalyst exhibited the best performance owing to its small size (50−100 nm), which benefited the transformation of methoxy intermediate to hydrocarbons, as a result of favored diffusion of methoxy intermediate to acid sites. It is also clearly discernable from the TEM image that the distance between In-Zr and acid sites in the well-dispersed MOF-derived hybrid support is shorter relative to others (i.e. distance between In-Zr oxide catalyst and zeolites), favoring methanol transformation to targeted olefins (Fig. 12b). Acid treatment of SAPO-34 could convert the tetrahedral framework of Al into octahedral Al species, resulting in decreased acid density [118]. Dang et al. [119] employed bifunctional In2O3-ZnZrOx/SAPO catalyst to access the effect of zeolite crystal size (0.4–1.5 μm) and pore structure on the performance of CO2 hydrogenation to olefins. The activity results are depicted in Fig. 12c, with optimum performance of 17 % CO2 conversion, and 85 % C2-C4 = olefins among hydrocarbon products. Small crystal size and hierarchical pore structure, with appropriate Brønsted acid sites, endowed the catalyst with high selectivity to lower olefins. As shown in Fig. 12d, the morphology of SAPO-34-C (1.5 μm) and SAPO-34-H (0.6 μm) changed from cuboid shape to butterfly geometry with irregular pores on the side faces, indicating the generation of a hierarchical structure after (1 wt%) nitric acid treatment. Meanwhile, SAPO-34-S (i.e. nano-sized zeolite), owing to its very small size, generated no hierarchical pore geometry after acidic treatment, but the particles were severely etched. Solid-state Magic-angle spinning (MAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to access the chemical environment of SAPO-34 and revealed that Brønsted acid sites are reduced after nitric acid treatment. The Brønsted acid sites are located at the bridging hydroxyl groups between the framework of Al and Si atoms, indicating that the surrounding vicinity of Al in SAPO-34 is closely related to acidic property [120]. Palygorskite, possessing a chain-layer structure was used to produce SAPO-34 [121]. Template agents including diethylamine (DEA), triethylamine (TEA), MOR, and TEAOH were employed to prepare palygorskite-based SAPO-34. While the DEA and TEA templates formed a small amount of SAPO-5 molecular sieve with flakes and hexagonal columnar morphology, the SAPO-34 prepared from MOR and TEAOH-based template agents revealed cubic shape with a small amount of rod-like palygorskite crystals attached to the surface, uniform size, and regular structure. The MOR and TEAOH-based SAPO-34 catalysts with ideal morphology were further treated with HCl, thereby destroying the structure of the palygorskite, and leading to reduced BET surface area, large pore volume, and pore size, which are beneficial to the adsorption of reactants and diffusion of product molecules [121,122]. The addition of HCl to palygorskite removed metal ion impurities, leaving behind mainly SiO2 (up to 70 %). The activity result showed that CuO-ZnO-Al2O3/SAPO-34 (TEAOH)HCl composite catalyst exhibited the highest performance (62 % light olefins, 2% CO, 10 % CH4, and 25 % C2-C4 at 673 K and 30 bar), due to the possession of ideal regular crystal structure, coupled with the possession of mild Brønsted acidity, which are unsuitable for the isomerization of light olefins to alkanes. 2.2.1.4 Core-shell type catalysts This synthesis strategy offers advantages including controllable size, shape, and surface properties. The core-shell strategy requires the encapsulation of nanoparticles into the core component, being protected by the shell, consequently allowing for the isolation of nanoparticles and prevention of migration and coalescence during the reaction (depending on target reaction) [123]. A very crucial factor to consider when designing a core-shell catalyst is the shell’s porosity, as it ultimately determines the accessibility of species from the outside to the surface of the core component. For instance, in CTLO reaction being catalyzed by a core-shell catalyst, the shell is usually a microporous zeolite shell, with the core being a metal-oxide catalyst. The CO2/H2 mixture passes through the microporous shell to the core metal-oxide sites where it is adsorbed to form methanol intermediate (methanol-mediated route). Then, the intermediate diffuses out of the core via the shell, where there are high chances of the acid sites catalyzing methanol to olefin [124]. Different core-shell catalyst preparation approaches can help to tune the porosity, crystal size, and topology of Brønsted acid sites, and the interaction among various species can be modulated in a manner that will enhance the desired structural property. In the synthesis of olefins, core-shell catalysts have been employed to hydrogenate CO in syngas to olefin (STO) and CO2 to lower olefins. Xie et al. [124] synthesized a well-defined core-shell structure (CeO2-Pt@mSiO2-Co), with the confined Pt/CeO2 interface serving as the core which converted CO2/H2 to CO, and the confined SiO2 in the vicinity of Co/mSiO2 shell interface (mSiO2 = mesoporous silica), transforming the CO intermediate to C2-C4 olefins through FTS pathway. Recently, metallic-oxide Zn-Cr covered by SAPO-34 was fabricated (Zn-Cr@SAPO-34 capsule) using an encapsulation approach (Fig. 13 a) [125]. The microporous SAPO-34 shell protected the Zn-Cr core, consequently blocking the contact between light olefins product and CO2 making it difficult for the lower olefins to further react to form paraffin on the Zn-Cr. The core-shell structure of the Zn-Cr@SAPO-34 capsule accorded the catalyst with a shortened distance between the two active components, consequently improving mass transfer and diffusion for an enhanced synergistic effect. The concentration of methanol intermediate during CO2 to olefins reaction via methanol-mediated route could affect the selectivity towards lower olefins. A low concentration of methanol intermediate could leave behind a large number of un-occupied acid sites on the zeolite material, leading to excessive acid sites to catalyze the MTO reaction. A novel core-shell catalyst design strategy could help to solve the CTLO problem. For instance, the presence of Zn in CZZ@Zn/SAPO-34 (CZZ represents CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 of 10:5:1 M ratio) reduced the total acidity and acid density of SAPO-34, leading to improved lower olefins selectivity [126]. Chen et al. [126] investigated the structure-performance behavior of bifunctional CuZnZr@Zn/SAPO-34 core-shell catalyst for CTLO reaction (Fig. 13b). The core-shell catalysts (i.e. CZZ@SAPO-34) exhibited a fairly uniform spherical structure, with the outer layer possessing cubic-type granules of SAPO-34 in a thickness of approximately 40 μm, evidencing that SAPO-34 structure was intact after coating the CZZ core (Fig. 13c). The modification of the catalysts with Zn (CZZ@Zn-SAPO-34) revealed an increased O/P ratio (4.1), CO2 conversion (20 %), and selectivity to C2-C4 = in hydrocarbon (60.5 %), relative to physically mixed CZZ/SAPO-34 (0.9, 13 %, 56 %, respectively). In the core-shell structure, SEM characterization revealed a tightly attached nanoparticles of Zr-Zn to SAPO-34, with large interface, consequently reducing the acidity of SAPO-34. 2.2.1.5 Mechanism over tandem catalysts The mechanism of CTLO reaction via methanol-mediated route combines CO2 hydrogenation over metal oxide active sites and methanol to olefins on zeolite sites. In the former, formate species has been agreed upon as the key reaction intermediate, regardless of the catalyst type. The formate species further hydrogenates to methoxide/formaldehyde, formic acid, depending on the nature of the catalyst [127]. In the MTO mechanism, the most crucial step is the CC bond formation. During the MTO step, the rate of methanol conversion is typically low at the beginning but later rises to 100 % after reacting for some period of time (120 −140 min at 450 °C, and 2 h−1 WHSV over SAPO-34) [27,128]. Once methanol begins to transform (via dehydration) into olefin products, its conversion will increase via an indirect pathway. Based on experimental data, the mechanism of methanol dehydration to olefins over SAPO-34 follows the indirect pathway [129,130]. In one of the mechanisms, methanol is dehydrated into (CH2)n (i.e. hydrocarbon pool, HCP) on the bulk of acid zeolite. Then, methanol reacts with the active HCP species to form lower olefins, which further undergoes alkylation, cyclization, condensation, hydrogen transfer to form light olefins, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbon. In the methanol-mediated pathway over tandem catalysts, the methanol thus obtained on the metal-oxide catalytic component migrates to the acidic zeolite where it is converted to various hydrocarbons via the classical HCP mechanism (Fig. 14 ). On the other hand, the dual-cycle mechanism postulated that there are two simultaneously competing cycles running in the zeolite pores (i.e. olefinic and aromatic cycles) [131]. The mechanism begins with a short induction period involving the direct formation of the CC bond, followed by the steady-state autocatalytic formation of hydrocarbons in the dual-concept. The olefinic and aromatic cycles are further subdivided into 3 pairs of elementary reaction steps involving methylation and dealkylation of aromatics, methylation, and cracking of olefins, cyclization, and hydrogen transfer. Since SAPO-34 and HZSM-5 tend to favor light olefins and aromatics respectively, the dual cycle mechanism represents a compromise between the two zeolites. Gascon et al. proposed a reaction mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins over Fe2O3@KO2/zeolite (Fig. 15 a). In the mechanism, CO was formed on the Fe3O4/KO2 catalysts via RWGS, after which part of the CO got transformed into different hydrocarbons on the Fe nanoparticles. The remaining CO diffused into the confined pores of zeolites (MOR and ZSM-5) via CO incorporation, to produce surface formates species, followed by subsequent in situ hydrogenation to surface methoxy species (SMS). The SMS undergoes further CO incorporation forming mostly ethylene, via direct reduction and deprotonation of ketene-like activation complex [100]. The same group proposed a different mechanism over the Fe-K/ZSM-5 catalyst [101]. Fig. 15b shows that CO (in situ via RWGS) converts to (CH2)x active hydrocarbon on the surface of the Fe-K surface, through an FT-like transformation. Then, the (CH2)x got carboxylated by CO, consequently forming ketenes on the zeolite component of the catalyst, bonding as zeolite/surface acetate species."
4,Research perspectives,"The synthesis of lower olefins from the hydrogenation of CO2 follows two pathways; CO2 modified-FT and methanol-mediated routes. Based on the literature reviewed herein, it appears that the plausible route would depend on the nature of the catalyst for the reaction. In the CO2-modified FTS route, Fe-based catalysts with alkali promoters on appropriate mixed oxide supports showed significant catalytic performance towards olefins production. In many cases, second metallic components (Cu, Mn, Co etc.) were incorporated into the Fe-based catalyst to form a hybrid catalyst, which not only facilitated the generation of active sites (particularly, various facets of iron-carbide) but also modulated the structural properties of Fe. On the other hand, the methanol-mediated route normally employs a combination of metal oxides (In2O3, ZrO2, ZnO, Ga2O3) for CO2 hydrogenation step, with zeolite acids for the MTO step. The representative standalone and tandem catalysts and their performance towards CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The selectivity to lower olefins (i.e. C2-C4 =) are reported in terms of total hydrocarbon distribution (i.e. without CO). The Fe-based standalone catalysts delivered better CO2 conversion (> 50 %) compared to tandem catalysts. Also, Fe-based standalone catalysts tend to produce gasoline-grade hydrocarbon (C5+), with selectivity reaching ∼ 25 %, compared to the tandem catalysts (< 10 %). In contrast to Fe-based catalysts, composite metal-oxides/SAPO-34 exhibiting bifunctional properties generally showed higher C2-C4 = olefins selectivity (∼ 89 %), with very low CH4 selectivity (∼ 5%) among the total hydrocarbons. This is an obvious deviation from the ASF distribution, owing to the strong synergistic interaction between the metal oxides and zeolite bifunctional sites in the tandem catalysts. The nature of the metal-oxides surface in tandem catalysts can determine the confinement of hydrocarbons within the zeolite pores. This is because various metal oxides possess different CO2 activation and CO adsorption ability for methoxy, and methanol intermediates formation required for subsequent conversion to olefins inside the zeolite pores. More so, the geometry/topology of the zeolite will determine the hydrocarbon product selectivity. For instance, it can be deduced from Table 2 that ZSM-5 zeolites tend to favor either C5+ (i.e. gasoline-range) or aromatic hydrocarbons. Beyond the chemical inertness of CO2, a wide range of product distribution, coupled with the production of undesired CO (via RWGS) and CH4 (via methanation) are the main challenges facing research advances in CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins. Many researchers have sought to combat these challenges by reducing structural defects (EFAl species, Silanol, etc.), through the use of a multi-templating strategy for zeolite design, towards enhancing zeolite functionality using acid treatment (e.g. HNO3), etc. These ultimately call for a rational design of highly active, intrinsically stable, and selective scalable bifunctional catalysts for the CTLO process. Achieving this requires a detailed understanding of structure-activity correlations via the use of combined computational and advanced spectroscopic characterization techniques. It can be safely deduced from this systematic review that many research investigations focused on catalytic performance, without insightfully probing the interaction among structure, diffusion, and performance. This has, to a large extent slowed the progress of fabricating the “breakthrough catalyst” worthy of industrial acceptability for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins. Some reports, although, employed advanced characterization techniques to access the physiochemical properties of synthesized catalysts, albeit, lack convincing analyses needed to establish a striking correlation between structural property and activity towards CTLO reaction. In light of the investigations on the CTLO process systematically reviewed herewith, future research should focus on the following detailed points. 1 Structural-Property Relationships: The ideal way to induce the electronic and geometric catalytic effects is through fine-tuning the synthesis condition, introducing other metallic components as promoters or supports to form a tandem catalyst with improved performance. To explore the structure-property relationship in tandem catalysts, for instance, it is crucial to know if the components of the catalyst strongly or weakly interact in the same aggregate. More so, during the course of the reaction, it is equally important to know if there is segregation of one or more of the components from the catalytic surface, and this can be achieved by using advanced characterization techniques (discussed in subsequent points). Computational techniques should be used to elucidate the interaction among catalytic components to induce an electronic effect in a manner that small atoms of the newly formed ensembles would possess active sites of various topologies such as kinks, corners, edges, tips, etc. For instance, density of state (DOS) calculations should be used to probe the electronic structure of metal-oxide surface as this will ultimately help to tune the adsorption energy for improved catalytic performance. This sort of computational approach allows researchers to locate a precise d-band center, consequently helping to better understand catalytic trends at the metal surface. Probing the presence of surface defects on catalysts' surface will be insightful in understanding how their presence affects catalytic performance. The information from such characterization, coupled with the knowledge of material and quantum chemistry can be used to tune the catalysts synthesis conditions, in a bid to optimize rational catalysts design for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins. 2 Improvement of Zeolite Topologies, Shape, and Size: Zeolites exhibiting very weak acidity normally favor hydrogen transfer reaction, consequently producing aromatics. Meanwhile, excessive acidity provides active sites for saturated hydrocarbon formation or coke formation. Therefore, research must focus on tuning Si/Al ratio which directly relates to acidity, to optimize Brønsted acid sites (mainly responsible for catalyzing CTLO reaction). For example, Xu et al. [132] utilized boron doping to tune the acidity of ZSM-5 (i.e. B-ZSM-5) for the conversion of methanol to propylene. The incorporation of boron into the zeolite MFI membrane offered the appropriate concentration and strength of Brønsted acidity to the ZSM-5 catalyst. When the density of Brønsted acid sites exceeds a certain catalytic threshold (best determined by computational quantum chemistry), they can modulate the structural orientation of the acidic sites, consequently favoring the alkene route. To fabricate a highly-efficient catalytic component for the conversion of methanol intermediate to lower olefins in tandem catalysts, it is important to understand the precise control of the intercrystalline nano-sized hierarchical porous structure. Unarguably, this can be achieved, to a large extent, by using various synthesis strategies (ultra-sound, microwave-assisted, templating, etc.), in a bid to endow the zeolite component with appropriate morphology to improve performance. For instance, to our knowledge, no report on CO2 hydrogenation to olefins has used the micro-wave-assisted approach to synthesize nanosized hierarchical zeolite. This zeolite synthesis strategy offers efficient energy use, facile morphology, homogeneous nucleation rate, and phase control, favorable for generating small zeolite crystals with uniform size distribution [133]. In a report for example, synthesizing SAPO-34 via ultrasonic-assisted method led to the formation of favorable spherical aggregated morphology with small particle size [134]. Research should also focus on employing a multi-templating strategy, as this can help to reduce zeolite particle size and improve intrinsic stability. In a report, TEAOH (25 %) and MOR (75 %) mixed template was used to develop spherical aggregate of nanosized SAPO-34, revealing reduced size, relative to using MOR template alone. The optimized SAPO-34 exhibited the longest lifetime of up to 840 min when tested for MTO reaction [74]. Furthermore, employing tri-templating agents for SAPO-34 synthesis, endowed the zeolite with high crystallinity, high surface area, and small nanoparticle size. These properties favored a significant increase in light olefin yield [135]. Beyond the multi-templating approach, research in the area of CO2 hydrogenation to olefins should also delve into the use of seed-assisted zeolite fabrication strategy. This approach can accelerate crystal growth, and leave behind zeolite with decreased crystal size. Sun et al. [136] synthesized nanosized H-ZSM-5 through this approach, with exponentially prolonged catalyst lifetime and a notable improvement in selectivity towards C2 and C3 light olefins, up to 85 % (673 K, WHSV =2 h−1). Therefore, CO2 to lower olefins research efforts should explore these frontiers, for improved catalytic performance. 3 Emerging Core-Shell Strategy: The majority of the catalysts tested for CTLO reaction via the methanol-mediated route involve two active components (metal oxide and zeolite). In this strategy, proximity and the large interfacial area between the two active components are pivotal towards modulating appropriate Brønsted acid sites. Moreover, the kind of precursor used in deriving the hybrid composite catalysts will go a long way to determine the length of the diffusion path. Many research works have been focused on the fabrication of catalysts via physical mixing, albeit, a few others employed the encapsulation strategy. A random physical mixing assembly would present an uncoordinated open environment for reaction to take place on the two active sites, consequently limiting the reaction of methanol intermediate to form olefins on the zeolite sites. This is because, some of the methanol would react outside the zeolite cage (absence of shape-selective regulation properties), thereby reducing the selectivity to lower olefins [125]. However, in the core-shell strategy, spatial arrangement increases the frequency of methanol intermediate to access the zeolite active sites. Therefore, increased research effort should be focused on synthesizing bifunctional core-shell microporous catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefin. This sort of catalyst would exhibit appropriate ensemble and electronic effects, beneficial to catalytic active sites. A breakthrough in designing novel and scalable 3-D nano-particle, with high performance, low cost, and intrinsic stability will not only help to mitigate CO2 emission but also contribute to the production of sustainable energy in the mid-term future. 4 Advanced Computational and Spectroscopic Techniques: A deeper understanding of solid-surface chemistry is central to the success of effective catalysts design. While a lot has been done by researchers in this context, a combination of knowledge from the fields of chemistry, computational dynamics, and engineering would go a long way to quicken the commercial attainability of CTLO. SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 zeolites are the most commonly used, even though they are not necessarily popular because of their ideal performance [28]. Researchers are yet to focus on creating favorable structural orientation of other zeolites/zeotypes with the appropriate acidity, pore system, pore size, and topology (e.g. CHA, BEA, MFI, DDR). Perhaps, a critical look into the characterization techniques detailed below will improve our understanding of the complex structure-activity correlations of metal-oxides/zeolite hybrid catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to olefins. A variety of research endeavors on CTLO have sought to understand structure-activity relationships using advanced characterization techniques including Mossbauer spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy (MAS and pulsed-field gradient methods), XANES, XAFS, to elucidate the chemical environment of molecular species, morphology, crystallographic phases etc.. Even so, the design of active, selective, and intrinsically stable catalysts for CTLO reaction is largely limited by a poor understanding of the structure and in situ chemical environment. This is undoubtedly desirable to identify the pivotal features that govern the metrics of a highly performing catalyst for the system under consideration. Neutron scattering characterization technique should be explored in the field of CTLO research, as it offers the ability to probe the structure and dynamics of catalysts. As earlier mentioned, the importance of metal-oxides and zeolite sites’ proximity and the molecular diffusion within the zeolite network cannot be overemphasized. The use of neutron total scattering (NTS) and Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) characterization techniques can provide vital information such as coordination among atoms, the distance between atoms in close proximity, and dynamics of diffusion. Very importantly, research should explore the use of state-of-art X-ray imaging techniques (Synchrotron-based). This can provide chemical and morphological information within the resolution of 10 nm to mm [137], a challenging adventure for the ex-situ imagine technique. 5 Mechanism of CTLO Reaction: The mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation over metal-oxides/zeolite hybrid catalyst remains elusive, complex surface reaction network being the culprit. A combination of advanced DFT computational study and in situ/ex situ spectroscopic studies can drive deeper elucidation of the reaction mechanism. In addition, more studies on the use of micro-kinetic modeling, machine learning, steady-state in situ transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) can give mechanistic insight and identification of active sites. Advanced computational studies should focus on DFT computation with consideration of ab initio thermodynamics, capable of exploring beyond the conventional DFT study typically conducted at 0 K condition, capturing a small time scale [138]. Although, advances in ab initio DFT computational studies have shown that it is inadequate for a detailed understanding of reaction mechanisms. To holistically describe an industrial reaction system from the atomic to the macroscopic scale, it is imperative to link atomic-scale DFT computation to multi-scale modeling. At a predictive-quality scale, multi-scale modeling allows for invaluable clarification of mechanistic understanding and screening of wide materials spaces for promising new catalysts – in silico [139]. To this end, attempts have been made to employ multi-scale first principle modeling consisting of ab initio DFT computation, kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, and macroscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the field of heterogeneous catalysis for exploring and designing emerging catalysis routes [140–143]. For instance, Huš et al. unraveled the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation using multi-scale modeling and experiment, on Zn3O3/Cu and a few other Cu/metal-oxides combinations. In their work, results from both micro-kinetic modeling and kMC simulations agreed with experimental data, even though no catalytic activity data from the experiment were used as an input variable in the modeling. This is a good computational development considering that multi-scale modeling can be used to investigate materials without requiring any prior explicit synthesis. In another investigation, the same research group reported multi-scale modeling of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over commercial Cu-based catalyst, by accounting for ab initio DFT computation, micro-kinetic modeling and kMC simulations, and CFD [144]. The kMC simulations were employed to show the evolution of catalytic surface coverage as a function of time and operating conditions on the microscopic level. The authors predicted H*, HCOO* and CH3O* intermediates as the most abundant adsorbed surface species, with their surface composition having a strong correlation with temperature and pressure. Initially, there was the only adsorption of H-atoms, until the catalyst surface got saturated at about 10−6 s, beyond which CO2 hydrogenation proceeded via the formation of HCOO** until steady state at 10-2 s. The authors noted that as operating temperature increases, the intermediate surface coverage decreased (most evident for H*). For pressure, the surface coverage for all intermediates increased with pressure. They further conducted CFD with first principle mean-field micro-kinetics modelling for CO2 hydrogenation, which not only revealed consistent catalytic activity results between modelling and experiments, but also confirmed the possibility of full virtual multi-scale modelling of industrial processes, capable of reducing computational time. As multi-scale modeling continues to be useful in many fronts, some authors have outlooked that its existing approaches are incapable of accounting for dynamic changes of working catalysts or cannot give insight into long-term degradation of catalysts [139]. Hence, the integration of machine learning (adaptive and recursive concepts) into a multi-scale modeling framework has been proposed. Interfacing between these two approaches will enable researchers to get hold of reliable feedback from catalyst composition, structure, and local concentration and temperature of the reaction medium. It appears that research investigations on CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins are yet to explore SSITKA, which remains a powerful tool to access the in situ kinetic information about reaction mechanism and catalysts surface reaction intermediates [145]. SSITKA study offers a leading advantage as reaction intermediate present on catalyst surface remains unchanged, under the isotopic mass effect. Beyond the determination of plausible mechanisms through SSITKA, we can also gain useful information about surface chemistry, including the concentration of adsorbed reaction species, distribution of catalytic activity, surface coverage. SSITKA can confirm that a particular reaction mechanism holds true for a number of catalytic reaction conditions, as opposed to traditional Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. On these premises, CTLO should leverage the powerful ability of isotopic kinetic study using various isotopic labels of CO2 (i.e. 12CO2, 13CO2) and H2 (1H. 2H, 3H)."
5,Conclusion,"As this systematic review considers direct hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins using heterogeneous catalysts, developing an industrial catalyst still remains challenging to researchers. Most especially, synthesis via the methanol-mediated route is still at its early stage, yet has prospects. As researchers continue to work on overcoming the activation barrier of inert CO2, it is equally crucial to invest significant research efforts towards limiting wide hydrocarbon distribution, methanation, and CO production. Fe-based catalysts offer a significant suppression of CO, thereby exhibiting high hydrocarbon selectivity, most especially in the presence of potassium promoter. However, selectivity to C2-C4 = olefins among these hydrocarbon products is low. This issue can be addressed by improving the development of bifunctional core-shell microporous catalysts for the process. Perhaps, a single core-shell tandem catalyst combining Fe, and/or other metal-oxides components as the core, and SAPO-34 as the shell, could be the solution to an industrial catalyst. The presence of moderate Brønsted acid sites, with a small 8-member ring window of SAPO-34, could be the reason for its high selectivity to lower olefins. As research in this area progresses, focusing on the five points raised in the research perspectives section will hopefully help to drive the design of high performing, stable and economical catalyst for the industrial synthesis of lower olefin from CO2 hydrogenation. Ultimately, a proper understanding of ensemble and electronic effect via the use of advanced computational techniques and spectroscopic studies would guide the breakthrough of rational design of an optimal catalyst for this process."
