0,Introduction,"In recent decades, there have been significant efforts to replace olefins derived from oil processing with alternatives with lower ecotoxicity and higher biodegradability. The hydrogenation of vegetable oils is a chemical process in which the saturation of the carbon-carbon double bonds (C = C) in the fatty acids (FA) of the oil occurs through the addition of hydrogen. The product is an oil with higher consistency, viscosity, melting point, and oxidation resistance [1]. These properties are required for the use of vegetable oils in non-edible applications as raw material for the production of bioparaffins, drug encapsulation, biolubricants, oxidative stabilization of biofuels and, alcohols and fatty acids synthesis, among others [2–6]. At industrial scale, vegetable oil hydrogenation is carried out in a semi-continuous slurry reactor equipped with blade stirrers and hydrogen bubbling. The reaction is performed at between 423 and 483 K, and 2.7 to 5.4 atm, using Raney Ni catalyst. After the reaction, the powder catalyst is separated from the hydrogenated oil with a filtration system, while the metal traces are removed in the bleaching step. The filtration and bleaching procedures are expensive, representing about 20% of the overall operating expenses, reaching up to 50% of total costs if those associated with hydrogen and catalyst consumption are excluded [7]. The use of structured catalysts could remove the filtration stage, reducing the processing costs and generating a more environmentally friendly process (avoiding the disposal of the spent catalyst). Metal-supported monoliths are suitable to achieve an efficient reuse of the catalyst, therefore making affordable the use of noble metals, which are more active and selective than Raney Ni catalyst. The use of palladium monolith catalysts in the hydrogenation of vegetable oil under different operating conditions, showing a progressive deactivation, has been investigated by several authors [8–10]. Boger et al. [10] found that the activity decreased in the first two batches to approximately 55% of the initial activity. After the third batch, no further change in activity was observed. On the other hand, Sánchez et al. found a drop of ∼25% in activity after the first reaction, and of ∼80% after six consecutive uses [11]. Considering these results, the application of palladium monoliths in the hydrogenation of vegetable oil carries a considerable economic risk [12]. The deactivation of palladium catalyst is caused by the formation of strongly adsorbed carbonaceous compounds on the metal surface, blocking the access to the active sites. Different regeneration methods have been studied, resulting in a slight improvement of catalyst activity [13]. On the other hand, platinum presents higher resistance than palladium particles to the formation of carbonaceous deposit, hence exhibiting better catalyst stability during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils [14]. Powder platinum catalysts have shown to be active for vegetable oil hydrogenation with lower selectivity towards trans fatty acids (TFA) in comparison to palladium and nickel catalysts [15–23]. No reports could be found in the literature on the hydrogenation of vegetable oil using platinum monolith catalysts. In this work, the synthesis of a platinum structured catalyst was studied. The noble metal was supported over an anodized aluminum substrate. The performance of the monolithic catalyst was evaluated for the hydrogenation of sunflower oil in a monolithic stirrer reactor. A thorough analysis of the stability of the catalyst was also performed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of monolithic catalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of monolithic catalyst An Al1050 commercial aluminum sheet was used as substrate for the preparation of the anodized Al monoliths. Table 1 shows the composition of the aluminum sheets. The aluminum foils were washed with water and acetone and dried in an oven to remove the impurities on the surface. After cleaning, the anodizing process was carried out using oxalic acid (1.6 M) as electrolyte at 313 K for 40 min, and 40 min pore opening. The flow density was 2 A dm−2. After the anodizing process, the samples were washed with water, dried, and then calcined at 723 K for 120 min in chromatographic air flow. Al2O3/Al monoliths were prepared by rolling up anodized flat and corrugated sheets. The geometric dimensions of the monoliths are given in Table 2 . The monoliths were loaded with platinum by the wet impregnation method at room temperature under orbital agitation. Two metal precursors were used: chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, Fluka) dissolved in water, and platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(C5H7O2)2, Pt(acac)2, Sigma-Aldrich)) dissolved in toluene. For the chloroplatinic acid precursor, the impregnation was carried out using a solution of 15.4 mM Pt for 60 min in the dark, at pH = 11, by adding ammonia solution (25%, Dorwil). On the other hand, for the platinum acetylacetonate precursor (23.9 mM Pt), the impregnation was performed for 24 h. After impregnation, both catalysts were dried at room temperature for 48 h and finally calcined at 723 K for 120 min in chromatographic air flow. The monolith catalysts were named as Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) and Pt/Al2O3/Al(ac) when chloroplatinic acid and platinum acetylacetonate precursors were used, respectively."
3,Characterization of monolithic catalyst,"2.2 Characterization of monolithic catalyst The monoliths were characterized using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm for surface area measurements at 77 K with a Quantachrome Instruments NOVA 1200e analyzer. The specific surfaces were calculated by BET method, while pore volume and pore size distribution were determined by the BJH method. Before analysis, the samples were degassed at 393 K for 24 h in vacuum. The platinum loading in the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with a Shimadzu 9000 spectrometer. Before the measurement, the samples were dissolved in aqua regia. The reduction temperature of the platinum particles supported over the anodized aluminum was determined by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) technique. The experiments were performed at between 298 and 773 K using an integrated unit equipped with a Gow-Mac model 10–952 thermal conductivity detector and a reducing gas mixture of 5% H2 in Ar (20 ml (NTP) min−1). Before the analysis, the monoliths were oxidized at 723 K for 60 min in chromatographic air flow (heating rate of 10 K min−1) and degassed at the same temperature for 60 min in Ar flow. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments were carried out using an integrated AutosorbIQ Quantachrome Instruments unit. The catalysts were oxidized at 723 K for 60 min in chromatographic air flow. After oxidation, they were reduced at 723 K for 60 min in chromatographic hydrogen flow and cooled under vacuum before analysis. The chemisorption analysis was performed at 313 K. The fraction of exposed platinum was calculated assuming a stoichiometry of one hydrogen atom adsorbed per surface Pt atom. The morphology and thickness of the alumina layer on the monolith substrate were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) on a LEO-EVO 40-XVP unit. The samples were previously coated through a metallization process. The amount of anodic alumina generated during the anodization process was determined from the weight difference of the Al2O3/Al monoliths before and after the chemical treatment performed to selectively dissolve the alumina layer. The dissolution process was carried out at 363 K for 45 min using a solution with a concentration of 0.5 M phosphoric acid and 0.2 M chromic acid. The mechanical stability of the catalysts was tested by the ultrasonic method. The samples were immersed in a hexane bath and subjected to an ultrasound bath at room temperature for 120 min in a Cole-Palmer 8892E-MT (47 KHz, 105 W) apparatus. Then the monoliths were dried. The weight of each sample was measured before and after the test to determine possible loss of catalytic material."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The reaction tests were carried out in a 600 ml Parr® reactor (model 4563) equipped with temperature controller and stirring, and operated in semi-continuous mode. The Pt/Al2O3/Al monoliths were reduced ex situ (773 K, 60 min, 20 ml H2 min−1) and then they were coated with refined sunflower oil. Two monoliths were mounted on the axis of the stirrer of the reactor, as blades. The catalytic tests were performed in the temperature range between 433 and 473 K, and hydrogen pressure between 2.7 and 5.4 atm, using 250 ml of commercial refined sunflower oil and chromatographic H2 (AGA, 99.9999% purity). Before the reaction test, the oxygen dissolved in the vegetable oil was removed by hydrogen bubbling for 60 min. The reaction time was 120 min with an agitation rate of 1400 rpm. The composition of the sunflower oil is given in Table 3 . When the set temperature was reached, the reaction was started by increasing hydrogen pressure. Samples were collected at regular times and the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The derivatization of the triglyceride (TG) was performed following the IUPAC standard method 2.301 [24]. The samples were analyzed on a HP4890D gas chromatograph using a SUPELCO SP2560 (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.2 mm) capillary column, according to the AOCS norm Ce 1c-89 [25]. The fatty acids in the analyzed samples were identified by comparison with Supelco 47,885-U analytical standard. The iodine value (IV) is a measure of the fatty acid unsaturation. It can be calculated from the fatty acid composition according to AOCS norm Cd 1c-85 [26]. The conversion was defined as the fraction of carbon-carbon double bonds hydrogenated during reaction test with respect to the original amount of double bonds. The C = C conversion at different times was calculated as follows (double bond shift was not considered): (1) X C = C [ % ] = I V 0 − IV I V 0 100 % where I V 0 is the initial IV value. Selectivity S1 is defined as the amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1) formed with respect to the amount of di-unsaturated fatty acids (C18:2) converted, while S2 is the amount of saturated fatty acids (C18:0) produced with respect to the amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1) converted. S1 and S2 were calculated by Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), respectively. (2) S 1 = C 18 : 1 − C 18 : 1 , 0 C 18 : 2 , 0 − C 18 : 2 (3) S 2 = C 18 : 0 − C 18 : 0 , 0 C 18 : 1 − C 18 : 1 , 0 where Ci,0 is the initial fatty acid concentration [mol m − 3]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis of the monolithic catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis of the monolithic catalysts The Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst was prepared by immersing the monoliths in a chloroplatinic acid solution at pH 11 (by adding ammonia solution), thus favoring the ligand substitution of [PtCl6]−2 complex according to the following reaction [27]: (1) [ PtC l 6 ] − 2 + 4 N H 3 → [ PtC l 2 ( N H 3 ) 4 ] + 2 + 4 C l − During the wet impregnation, the anodic alumina surface is negatively charged because the pH of the solution is higher than the isoelectric point of alumina, PZC = 8.3 [28]. The charge difference between the [ PtC l 2 ( N H 3 ) 4 ] + 2 complex and the alumina layer generates an electrostatic interaction, bounding the complex to the alumina surface [29]. On other hand, the Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac) monolith catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation using platinum acetylacetonate dissolved in toluene. It was reported that the Pt(acac)2 complex is bound to the alumina surface by physisorption interaction (without chemical reaction) [30]. The adsorption of the Pt(acac)2 complex over alumina is relatively weak in comparison with other noble metal acetylacetonate precursors [31]. This behavior may be explained considering that Pt (II) does not accept axial ligands in the planar Pt(acac)2 complex and that the interaction between the ligand π electrons and surface hydroxyl groups by hydrogen bonding is not sufficiently strong to anchor the complex [30,32]. The thermal decomposition of adsorbed platinum acetylacetonate species occurs between 393 and 623 K, forming PtO and PtO2 particles fixed to the support [31]."
7,Characterization of the monolithic catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of the monolithic catalysts Table 4 shows the Pt loading on the monolith catalysts and the dispersion ( ϕ ) (calculated from chemisorption measurement). Platinum particle size was estimated from its metal dispersion by Eq. (4), assuming semispherical geometry [33]. (4) D Pt = 6 M ρ M ϕ N a S a where D Pt is the platinum particle diameter [m], M is the metal atomic weight, ρ is the metal density (21.45 g cm−3), Na is the Avogadro number [atom mol−1], and Sa is the area of each surface platinum atom (8.0 10−20 m2 atom−1). Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst presented a metal dispersion of 62.1%. This result is similar to that reported by other authors using H2PtCl6 as metal precursor [34–36]. In contrast, Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac) catalyst showed a low metal dispersion (6.8%). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported in the literature about platinum particles supported over anodized aluminum using Pt(acac)2 as precursor. The mechanism by which Pt(acac)2 interacts with the alumina surface, and consequently the metal dispersion, depends on the nature of the active sites resulting from pre-treatment. Womes et al. [30] proposed that an adequate refilling of the support increases the anchoring of the Pt(acac)2 complex on the alumina surface, favoring the formation of smaller platinum particles. The textural properties of the anodized aluminum monoliths and catalysts were determined from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, and they are shown in Table 5 . The amount of alumina generated during the anodization process was 33.9 g Al2O3 by square meter of aluminum. The BET surface area of Al2O3/Al monoliths was 23.4 m2 g − 1 Al2O3, with a pore radius of 205 Å. Table 5 indicates that the morphological properties of the alumina layer were slightly modified during catalyst preparation. An increase in metal loading led to a decrease in surface area, pore radius and pore volume. The decrease in the average pore radius may indicate that the platinum particles could be located in the pores, resulting in a slight narrowing of the mesoporous channels [37,38]. The morphology and thickness of the alumina generated on the aluminum was analyzed by SEM. Fig. 1 A shows a cross-section of the sinusoidal monolith channels. Fig. 1B displays the alumina pores, which are perpendicular to the aluminum surface. Fig. 1C presents a top view of the anodized aluminum surface, showing that the alumina layer generated was homogeneous, with regular pores covering the complete aluminum surface. Some large openings are also observed. The pore radius observed is in good agreement with the value calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm by the BJH method (Table 5). Fig. 1D shows that the thickness of the alumina layer was of approximately 17 μm. Fig. 2 presents the TPR profiles of the oxidized samples, where the hydrogen consumption is plotted as a function of temperature for the Pt/Al2O3/Al catalysts using H2PtCl6 and Pt(acac)2 metal precursors. The profiles show positive peaks assigned to the reduction of Pt oxide. The reactions involved in the reduction process are the following: (2) Pt O 2 + H 2 → PtO + H 2 O (3) PtO + H 2 → P t 0 + H 2 O Both TPR profiles are similar, with three main peaks. Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst showed hydrogen consumption signals at 418, 568 and 643 K, while Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac) exhibited peaks at 413, 493 and 643 K. The hydrogen consumptions at temperatures below 550 K can be attributed to the reduction of platinum oxide particles. Meanwhile, the hydrogen consumption at higher temperatures can be associated with the reduction of platinum particles that interact strongly with the support [35]. The reduction temperature of the platinum catalysts mainly depends on the properties of the support and the catalyst preparation procedure [39–43]. Guo et al. [44] prepared a Pt/Al2O3/Al catalyst using chloroplatinic acid precursor. They observed hydrogen consumption peaks at 400, 710 and 780 K during the TPR analysis. In comparison with Guo´s catalyst preparation, the Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst studied in this work was dried for a longer period of time at room temperature after wet impregnation, favoring the formation of metal particles with lower reduction temperature, as reported by Belskaya et al. [45,46]. On the other hand, no reports could be found in the literature on TPR studies for Pt/Al2O3/Al catalyst using Pt(acac)2 precursor."
8,Catalytic tests,"3.3 Catalytic tests 3.3.1 Mass transfer effects 3.3.1.1 External mass transfer effects The Carberry criterion was used to determine the existence of external mass transfer limitations in the gas-liquid interface ( C a GL ) and liquid-solid film ( C a LS ) [47]. The external mass transfer limitations can be neglected when Ca < 0.05. The Carberry criterion is presented in Eqs. (5) and 6: (5) C a GL = ( − r obs ) k GL a GL C H 2 * (6) C a LS = ( − r obs , i ) k LS , i a LS C i where r obs is the observed rate [mol m − 3 s − 1], C is the concentration [mol m − 3] and the subscript i presents the reactant TG and H2. The volumetric gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient ( k GL ) in the reaction system was determined by Sánchez et al. [11] using the adsorption method, finding k GL a GL = 0.15 s − 1 for the same operating conditions as those studied in this work. The hydrogen concentration in the vegetable oil ( C H 2 * ) was calculated with the correlation proposed by Fillion and Morsi [48]. The liquid-solid mass transfer area ( a LS ) was determined from the dimensions of the foils that make up the monoliths as 3834 m2 m − 3. The liquid-solid mass transfer coefficients were determined from [49] as k LS , H 2 = 6.89 10−4 m s − 1 for hydrogen, and as k LS , TG = 4.35 10−5 m s − 1 for TG. Under the evaluated operating conditions, it was found that the external mass transfer limitations can be neglected in the liquid-solid film (for H2 and TG), while in the gas-liquid interface the reaction system presented restrictions. Similar observations were made by Boger et al. [10] and Zieverink [50] using monoliths for the hydrogenation of vegetable oil. 3.3.1.2 Internal mass transfer effects The Weisz-Prater criterion (Eq. (7)) was used to evaluate the existence of intraparticle diffusion limitations for both hydrogen and TG in the reaction system: (7) Φ i = ( − r obs , i ) ρ c L 2 D eff , i C i where Deff is the effective diffusion coefficient [m2 s − 1], L is the Al2O3 layer thickness [m], and ρ c is its apparent density [Kg m − 3]. The effective diffusion coefficient was calculated as follows: (8) D eff , i = D i ε τ According to the Weisz-Prater criterion, the internal mass transfer limitations can be neglected when Φ i < 0.1 [47]. Intraparticle diffusion coefficients were determined as D H 2 = 2.43 10−8 m2 s − 1 [48] and D TG = 3.62 10−10 m2 s − 1 [51]. The sunflower oil density was determined from [52] as ρ TG = 815.53 Kg m − 3. The catalyst density was 1220 kg m − 3 [53] and the Al2O3 thickness was 17 μm. The alumina tortuosity factor ( τ ) was 1 (due to the linear geometry of the pore) and the porosity was determined as ε = 0.3 [54]. The numerical value of the Weisz-Prater module was between 0.9 and 4.8 for H2, and 1.4 and 4.6 for TG. These results indicate that it is not possible to neglect the intraparticle diffusion limitations. 3.3.2 Effect of metal precursors on catalyst performance The Pt/Al2O3/Al monolith catalysts were tested in the partial hydrogenation of sunflower oil at 453 K and 4.1 atm. Fig. 3 shows the C = C conversion at different reaction times. Both catalysts reached a conversion of 18% at 120 min. However, the profiles differ, since Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst showed higher C = C conversions during the first 70 min of reaction. Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst had a lower metal loading than Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac) monolith, with a higher metal dispersion. The initial TOF (turnover frequency) was determined, being 7.8 and 13.7 s − 1 for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) and Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac), respectively. The results found in this work are in good agreement with those reported by other authors for Pt, taking into account that the support has a predominant effect in terms of catalyst activity for vegetable oil hydrogenation [15]. Cepeda et al. [16] investigated the hydrogenation of sunflower oil using Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (with H2PtCl6 as metal precursor), reaching a C = C conversion of 39% at 102 min and 423 K, 3.5 atm, and 0.0248 Kg Pt m − 3 oil (no metal dispersion was reported). McArdle et al. [2121] found a conversion of 19% at 120 min and 443 K, 3 atm, and 0.0063 Kg Ptsup m − 3 oil for the sunflower oil hydrogenation catalyzed by Pt/γ-Al2O3. Cheng et al. [23] reported a double bond conversion of 40% at 180 min and 443 K, 3 atm, and 0.0063 Kg Ptsup m − 3 oil for the soybean oil hydrogenation using Pt/carbon catalyst. Fig. 4 and 5 show the numerical values of S1 and S2, and the trans-isomer and stearic acid (C18:0) content, respectively, as a function of the double bond C = C conversion. The values of S1 at 18% conversion were 0.70 and 0.83 for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) and Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac), respectively, indicating that the hydrogenation of C18:2 to C18:1 was more pronounced for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac). On the other hand, the value of S2 was 0.30 and 0.17 for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) and Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac), respectively, indicating that the saturation of C18:1 to C18:0 was more pronounced for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl). Fig. 5 shows that Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) generated a higher amount of saturated fatty acids than Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac) catalyst at equal double bond conversion. In contrast, a higher trans-isomer content was observed for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac). These results can be understood in view of the platinum particle size. As stated by several authors, the selectivity of platinum catalysts in vegetable oil hydrogenation is influenced by metal particle size [21,23]. Smaller platinum particles promote the formation of saturated fatty acids. On the other hand, larger particles present a greater tendency to produce monounsaturated fatty acids, suggesting weaker double bond adsorption and faster desorption from the active sites of platinum particles before the full hydrogenation of FA can occur [21]. The particle size effect on trans-isomer formation may be explained considering the electronic properties of metallic supported particles. The metal-support interaction and the presence of electronegative ions (such as Cl−) on the catalyst surface reduce the electronic density of metal clusters, consequently increasing the adsorption strength of C = C double bonds [55]. In this sense, Nohair et al. [56] reported that an increase in the electronic density of the metal clusters yields a reduction in the adsorption strength of double bonds. In this way, smaller metal clusters tend to experiment electronic density alterations, favoring the double bond adsorption and facilitating the conversion of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated compounds, thus resulting in lower TFA levels. The TFA content found for Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) at XCC = ∼18% was slightly lower than that reported by Cepeda et al. [16] (18% trans-isomer formation) for powder Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst under similar operating conditions and with equal double bond conversion in sunflower oil hydrogenation. On the other hand, Sánchez et al. [11] observed 21% total trans-isomers at 20% double bond conversion (373 K and 4.1 atm) in the hydrogenation of sunflower oil using Pd/Al2O3/Al monolith catalyst. In agreement with these results, several authors have reported that platinum catalysts are less selective to trans-isomer formation than palladium catalysts [16,18,23]. 3.3.3 Effects of the operating conditions on the studied reaction Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) was selected to study the effects of the operating conditions on the hydrogenation of sunflower oil due to its low selectivity towards trans-isomer formation. Table 6 shows the double bond conversion, selectivities S1 and S2, and TFA concentration obtained in the catalytic tests at different temperature and H2 pressure, for a reaction time of 120 min. The highest and lowest conversions reached were 23.9% (Run 1) and 6.8% (Run 9), respectively. The highest trans-isomer content was 24.1% (Run 3), whereas the lowest was 7.8% (Run 9). A polynomial equation was used to model the response of the reaction test results (Table 6) as a function of the independent variables (temperature and pressure): (9) Z = α 0 + α 1 T + α 2 T 2 + α 3 P + α 4 P 2 where Z is the predicted response, T is temperature [K], and P is the hydrogen pressure [atm]. Multiple regression was applied to determine the coefficients α i of Eq. (9). The goodness of fit of the polynomial model was expressed in terms of the coefficient of determination R2. The results obtained by the multiple regression method are given in Table 7 . According to the obtained R2 values, the adjustment of the responses by polynomial Eq. (9) was satisfactory. Three-dimensional response surfaces are presented in Fig. 6 to analyze the effect of the experimental variables on XCC, S1, S2 and TFA content. The effect of the operating conditions on the responses are discussed below: a. Double bond conversion The increase in temperature and H2 pressure had a positive effect on C = C conversion (Fig. 6A). The conversion increased with temperature because the hydrogenation reaction rate increased. At higher temperatures, this effect was attenuated since mass diffusion effects restrict the overall reaction process. The conversion increased along with pressure for the whole range of analyzed conditions because the solubility of molecular hydrogen in the oil increases [48]. b. S1 and S2 selectivities Hydrogen pressure had a predominant influence on the selectivities toward the mono and saturated fatty acids. An increase in P H 2 had a negative effect on S1 and a positive effect on S2, as it can be seen in Fig. 6B and 6C. The formation of saturated FA was favored at lower temperatures and higher pressure. As stated above, an increase in pressure led to an increment in hydrogen solubility, favoring H2 adsorption over the catalyst surface, and in turn favoring the complete hydrogenation of unsaturated FA, which originates a decrease in S1. This behavior can be understood considering the overall hydrogenation process, which involves the saturation of cis-C18:2 to cis-C18:1 and its subsequent saturation to C18:0. The reaction pathway also involves the geometric isomerization of cis-C18:2 to trans-C18:2 and cis-C18:1 to trans-C18:1, and the hydrogenation of trans-C18:2 to cis-C18:1 and trans-C18:1 to C18:0. c. Trans-isomer formation Fig. 6D shows the TFA content as a function of the studied variables. This response increased with temperature due to the increase in the reaction rate of the cis-trans isomerization. This behavior has been documented previously by several authors, considering that trans-isomers are thermodynamically more stable than cis-isomers [21,22]. On the other hand, an increase in hydrogen pressure had a negative effect on this response at high temperature. This can be understood in view of the fact that, as temperature increases, the solubility of H2 in the oil rises [48]. This favored the adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst surface, increasing the probability of the adsorbed C = C bond being hydrogenated instead of isomerized [57]. The effect of hydrogen pressure on TFA formation also can be explained by the hydrogenation mechanism proposed by Horiuti-Polanyi [58]. According to this mechanism, the H2 molecule dissociates on the catalyst surface, reacting with the adsorbed fatty acid and forming an unstable half-hydrogenated intermediate complex. This half-hydrogenated intermediate can isomerize, or add or lose an additional hydrogen, depending on the hydrogen concentration on the catalyst surface and the hydrogenation activity. The trans-isomers formation is promoted at low hydrogen concentration (low pressure), while the hydrogenation reactions are favored at high concentration of hydrogen on the catalyst surface (high pressure). At 433 K, the pressure positively affected the production of trans fatty acids. This behavior may have occurred because at low temperatures, when the hydrogenation activity is low, the isomerization of the half-hydrogenated intermediate was promoted before C = C double bond saturation. This suggests that isomerization reactions are more sensitive concerning temperature than hydrogenation reactions. Cepeda & Calvo [59] examined the hydrogenation of sunflower oil with Ni/SiO2 catalyst using response surface methodology under similar reaction conditions to those studied in the present work. They reported that the effect of hydrogen pressure on trans isomer formation depends on hydrogenation activity, which is also determined by temperature reaction."
9,Stability of the monolith catalyst,"3.4 Stability of the monolith catalyst 3.4.1 Reaction test One of the main advantages of monolith catalysts is the possibility to easily separate them from the liquid reaction media and use them repeatedly. In this context, the stability of the structured catalyst is relevant. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported in the literature about the stability of structured platinum catalysts in vegetable oil hydrogenation. In this work, multiple consecutive tests (453 K, 4.1 atm, 0.02134 Kg Ptsup m − 3 oil and 120 min reaction time) with Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst were carried out to examine the effects of reuse on activity and selectivity. No treatment was performed in the samples between the tests. After the reaction, the monoliths were removed from the reaction medium and immediately dipped in a new batch of previously deoxygenated sunflower oil. Fig. 7 shows the double bond conversion, selectivities S1 and S2, and trans-isomer formation for 40 consecutive tests using Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7A, the double bond conversion remained almost constant (between 21 and 23%) after 40 consecutive uses of the catalyst, without any treatment between the tests. Meanwhile, trans-isomer formation exhibited a slight variation between 13.4 and 14.1%. These results are in agreement with those reported by Edvarsson et al. [14], who observed that after five consecutive tests, the powder catalyst Pt/γ-Al2O3 showed no change in activity or selectivity for the hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters. S1 had little variation (between 0.70 and 0.72), indicating that the formation of cis-monounsaturated compounds in multiple catalyst tests was favored. On the other hand, S2 showed a slight increase after twenty consecutive uses and then remained constant (between 0.21 and 0.23). 3.4.2 Characterization of the spent catalyst After 40 consecutive uses, the Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) monoliths were washed in hexane (at 323 K, three times), dried, and finally calcined at 723 K for 120 min in chromatographic air flow. Then they were characterized and compared to a fresh sample. Ultrasound adherence tests were performed to analyze the mechanical stability of the monoliths. As shown in Table 8 , no loss of catalyst support was detected in the spent sample. The textural properties of fresh and spent monolith catalysts were examined to detect possible morphological alterations. The results are given in Table 9 . The textural properties of the monolith remained unaltered after 40 reaction tests. The metal loading and the reduction temperature of platinum supported particles on monolith catalysts after multiple consecutive uses were determined by ICP-AES and TPR techniques, respectively. The results showed that the metal loading remained unaltered after 40 consecutive uses. Fig. 8 shows the TPR profiles of fresh and spent Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) monoliths. The area under the curve for fresh and spent catalyst was 142 and 144 arbitrary units, respectively, indicating that the reduction temperature did not have modifications. The active area of platinum supported catalysts can decrease by sintering of the metallic particles or by the chemisorption of intermediary compounds on the surface [60]. The metal dispersion of the monolith catalyst after multiple reaction tests was determined from H2 chemisorption data. As shown in Table 10 , the percentage of exposed metal remained constant for the successive reaction tests."
10,Monolith catalyst handling,"3.5 Monolith catalyst handling The preservation of the catalytic properties during storage, handling and commercial distribution is an important feature for the scale-up of monolith catalysts. The Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst has a higher reduction temperature than the maximum admissible operating temperature for most commercial dead-end reactors (493 K). The monolith catalyst has to be reduced ex-situ prior to being used in the reaction. In order to study the stability of the reduced Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst under storage conditions, the monoliths were reduced ex-situ (as described in Section 2.3) and coated with hydrogenated oil (IV = 30). Then the samples were cooled at room temperature and stored at 283 K for 180 days. Table 11 shows the composition of the partially hydrogenated sunflower oil obtained using fresh and stored catalysts. The operating conditions were: 453 K, 4.1 atm, 0.02134 Kg Ptsup m − 3 oil, and 120 min reaction time. The composition of the partially hydrogenated sunflower oil using fresh and stored monoliths was similar, indicating that the storage procedure was suitable to maintain the activity and selectivity of Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) catalyst for 180 days. In this way, the monoliths could be prepared and safely distributed. Table 12 compares the hydrogenation of refined sunflower oil carried out using the Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) sample and a commercial Raney Ni catalyst (Pricat 9910) at 453 K, 4.1 atm and 1400 rpm [61]. Fig. 9 shows images of the partially hydrogenated sunflower oil obtained using both catalysts. As shown in Table 12, for a C = C double bound conversion of ∼17%, the commercial Raney Ni catalyst was more selective toward TFA, promoting the production of monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1), and consequently showing higher values of S1 than Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl). This indicated that Raney Ni catalysts have a lower selectivity towards saturated compounds (S2). When the commercial Raney Ni was used, the hydrogenated oil showed a darker color, whereas with the monolith catalyst the oil exhibited the characteristic white color of hydrogenated edible oil. The application of monolith catalysts could avoid the expensive filtration and bleaching stages after the hydrogenation reaction."
11,Conclusion,"Platinum monolith catalysts with a substrate of anodized aluminum were successfully synthetized. The platinum catalysts were prepared with chloroplatinic acid and platinum acetylacetonate, and they showed to be active and stable in the partial hydrogenation of sunflower oil, reaching a double bond conversion of 18% at 453 K and 4.1 atm. The metal precursor used in the synthesis affected the catalytic properties of samples. The catalyst prepared from H2PtCl6 had a higher metal dispersion than the Pt(acac)2 loaded catalyst. The smaller Pt particles present in the 1.25% Pt/Al2O3/Al(Cl) had lower selectivity toward trans isomers and higher selectivity towards saturated compounds than the larger size particles in 2.25% Pt/Al2O3/Al(Ac). The effect of temperature and hydrogen pressure on C = C conversion, S1 and S2 selectivities and TFA content was studied using response surface methodology. It was determined that an increase in temperature and hydrogen pressure had a positive effect on C = C conversion, whereas S1 selectivity was favored by higher temperatures and low pressures. On the other hand, the trans isomer formation increased with temperature, whereas pressure exhibited a positive effect at lower temperature and a negative effect at higher temperature. This behavior may be attributed to the hydrogenation mechanism. The H2PtCl6 impregnated monolith catalyst was tested for multiple reuses. The catalyst maintained its initial activity and selectivity after 40 consecutive uses, with its catalytic properties unaltered. The results obtained in the preliminary catalytic stability test indicated that the catalyst could be used repeatedly for vegetable oil hydrogenation at larger scale maintaining the properties of the final product. As for the commercial nickel catalysts, the reduction temperature of the monolith catalyst prepared with H2PtCl6 was higher than the maximum temperature accepted for most commercial dead-end reactors (493 K). The monolithic catalyst was reduced, covered with hydrogenated oil and stored for 180 days without any detriment to its catalytic properties. This could represent a strategic advantage for the production and commercialization of platinum monolith at large scale."
