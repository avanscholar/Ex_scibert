0,Introduction,"In the past decade, it has been consistently shown that a hydrogen economy is one of the most promising alternatives to reduce greenhouse emissions to almost zero, especially if the production source is renewable (e.g. biomass or water). However, this concept has lost momentum due to a lack of hydrogen gas availability and the hurdles that need to be overcome concerning production, storage and utilization technologies [1]. On the other hand, hydrogen still plays a crucial role in the current economy in processes such as ammonia production and petroleum refining. Additionally, in the context of bio-economy hydrogen is also indispensable to increase the H/C ratio of biomass in order to convert it into biofuels similar to petroleum [2]. Traditional ways to produce hydrogen are steam reforming, partial oxidation (gasification) or pyrolysis of fossil or renewable sources. Another available technology is water electrolysis, however only a small percentage of the worldwide hydrogen production occurs this way because of its high energy demand. It is well known that global warming and the depletion of fossil sources are problems that need to be urgently addressed. For this reason, the use of biomass or biomass byproducts (e.g., lignin) has been proposed as an alternative solution. Due to its renewable nature, biomass has high potential for hydrogen production. Hydrothermal gasification of biomass involves the splitting of organic compounds with supercritical water. This is described in Eq. (1) as the ideal case of complete conversion to hydrogen with glucose as model compound for biomass. Primarily, carbon monoxide is formed, which reacts with water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Eq. (2)). The equilibrium of the water gas shift reaction is shifted towards the hydrogen side due to the presence of large water quantities. This means that water is an important reactant, not only in reaction (2) but also for the hydrolysis of biomass to glucose. The water gas shift reaction is kinetically inhibited but this can be overcome with alkali metals, which act as catalysts for this reaction [3–6]. Hydrogen formation is favored at temperatures significantly larger than the critical point of water (Tc =374°C and Pc =22.1MPa) because of its endothermic nature [7]. Reactions (1) and (2) consume water, therefore – according to the Le Châtelier principle – are favored at high dilution conditions. Consequently, at very low feedstock concentrations (e.g. 1wt.%), hydrogen formation is also possible at rather low temperatures. This effect is used in Aqueous Phase Reforming in the presence of nickel or other noble metal as catalyst. The presence of a solid catalyst limits the use of solid biomass, because biomass hydrolysis at these temperatures is rather slow. Only if dissolved organic compounds like model substances (e.g. glucose, sorbitol or glycol) are used as feedstock, significant amounts of hydrogen are attainable [8,9]. At temperatures near to the critical point of water, methane is the preferred product. Methane and carbon dioxide (Reaction (3)) are thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and higher concentrations or biomass dry mass content [7]. At temperatures around the critical point, water hydrolysis and CO formation are fast enough to enable the hydrogenation of CO on a solid catalyst (Eq. (4), [10]). This reaction needs typical hydrogenation catalysts like nickel or other noble metals, which also catalyze the reverse reaction depending on the equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the same hydrogenation catalysts (e.g. Ni, Rh, Pt) that are useful for CO hydrogenation to methane, are also useful for the hydrogen formation from hydrogen-rich compounds used in Aqueous Phase Reforming (Reaction (4)). (1) C6H12O6 +6H2O→6CO2 +12H2 (2) CO+H2O⇄CO2 +H2 (3) C6H12O6 →3CH4+3CO2 (4) CO+3H2 ⇄CH4 +H2O Hydrothermal gasification is a biomass conversion process that takes place at significantly higher pressures (approximately 30MPa) but relatively lower temperatures (around 600°C) than to reforming and dry gasification (800–1200°C). Also, it makes use of water as reaction medium; therefore, it is compatible with wet biomass. Depending on the reaction temperatures, hydrothermal gasification processes can be divided into three sub-categories: • Aqueous phase reforming (T=215–265°C) – Main products: H2 and CO2. When using biomass derived compounds (glucose, sorbitol, glycerol, methanol, and glycol) under subcritical conditions, it is thermodynamically possible to obtain hydrogen if the feedstock concentration is very low (around 1%), however the hydrolysis of biomass is slow. Noble metal catalysts are necessary for the hydrogen formation. High molecular weight constituents like lignin or cellulose are difficult to gasify in this way [11–13]. • Near critical 1 1 The terms „sub-critical“, „near critical” and “supercritical” refers to the critical point of water not of the mixture. catalyzed gasification (T=350–400°C) – Main product: CH4. Biomass or biomass compounds are gasified at near critical gasification conditions to obtain high degrees of carbon conversion to methane. Catalysts help to enhance the methane formation from CO hydrogenation [14]. • Supercritical water gasification (SCWG; T>374°C) – temperatures higher than 500°C are usually employed to obtain H2 and CO2 as main products. This process show high conversion rates; however, it is highly dependable on factors like operation conditions, feedstock, the nature of the catalyst (if used) or the reactor design. The gaseous products obtained from SCWG are mainly H2, CO2 and, in lower but varying amounts, CH4 [15]. Short-chain hydrocarbons, such as ethane, ethene, propane and propene, as well as CO are found in small amounts, since CO is partially consumed by the water shift (Reaction (2)) and, if a catalyst is present, by methanation (Reaction (4)) reactions. By considering the main global reactions and equilibria involved in the production of hydrogen and methane, it becomes obvious that the most important criteria that influence biomass gasification are: 1. Temperature: Higher temperatures favor hydrogen and lower methane production. 2. Biomass to water ratio (usually expressed as dry matter content). 3. Catalysts; for promoting Reactions (2) and (4) or to avoid unwanted side reactions. Biomass consists of many different components; therefore, it is a complex task to understand their influence on biomass gasification. As it was previously stated, hydrogen is crucial for the development of a bio-economy. In this scenario, biomass is not only used to produce hydrogen with a low CO2 print but also the hydrogen and the biomass is used to produce bio oil. This review covers some of the older key studies as well as several earlier reports [16–26] to contextualize the fundamentals of SCWG of biomass. In addition, the knowledge is updated by incorporating recent literature."
1,Influential factors on the hydrogen production in supercritical water gasification,
2,Biomass composition and structure,"2.1 Biomass composition and structure Lignocellulose is the abundant construction material of the cell walls of all terrestrial plants and contributes almost 90% to the available land biomass. Its use in form of agricultural, forestall and industrial residues and wastes is not in direct competition with food and feed production; therefore, it is a versatile feedstock to produce second-generation biofuel. The simplified average composition of lignocellulosic biomass consists of 40–55wt.% cellulose fibers and 15–35wt.% hemicellulose embedded in 20–40wt.% of lignin represented by C6H8O4 as approximate sum formula. Most of the cellulose in biomass is crystalline and a small portion is amorphous. Crystalline cellulose is built up by 5000–15000 glucose units β-1,4 glycosidic and hydrogen bonds. Amorphous hemicellulose consists of branched C5- and C6-sugars (xylose, manose, arabinose, glucose and galactose) linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds with a polymerization degree of 100–1000. The most abundant sugar unit in hemicellulose differs depending on the type of biomass. In the case of softwood glucomannan, a polymer composed of glucose and manose, is more abundant and in hardwoods glucuronoxylan predominates [27]. Lignin is composed from p-Hydroxy-propyl-benzene structures, namely p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, which are connected by ether and CC bonds to build a three-dimensional network. The proportion of these units vary from species to species: grasses consist of p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol units; softwood lignins are mostly conformed by coniferyl alcohol, and that from hardwoods is rich in coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol units [28]. In addition, varying amounts of moisture, inorganic ash and other constituents like proteins or resins are contained in lignocellulosic biomass. When it comes to hydrogen production via hydrothermal gasification, biomass composition is a determining parameter. Ash and protein content or the amount of lignin can shift the conversion efficiency towards higher or lower hydrogen yields. The impact of these factors on the final product distribution is presented in the following sections."
3,Cellulose and hemicellulose,"2.2 Cellulose and hemicellulose The decomposition mechanism of cellulose and hemicellulose as well as their contribution to the hydrogen formation has been usually studied with model substances using pure cellulose and xylan. T. Yoshida et al. [29] showed that cellulose contributes more to the hydrogen production than hemicellulose (xylan), possibly because of its intrinsic larger hydrogen content. Additionally, they established that there is no interaction between these components during SCWG. On the contrary, the authors showed that cellulose and xylan interact with lignin (organosolv) by acting as hydrogen donors for lignin splitting. This was established since the presence of lignin in the feedstock mixture dramatically lowered the hydrogen yield, which led to the conclusion that lignin undergoes a hydrogenation reaction. These results are supported by the findings of D. Meier et al. [30], who investigated the effect of hydrogen during hydropyrolysis of lignin. The results were obtained by varying the partial pressure of hydrogen, which led to an increase of the oil yield and to a decrease of the char yield from 41% to 3%. This indicated that recondensation reactions of lignin degradation products were avoided in the presence of sufficient and reactive H2. E. Weiss-Hortala et al. [31] analyzed the effect of phenol, as model substance for lignin, on the glucose gasification and they realized that even a small amount of phenol in the mixture could drastically reduce the hydrogen yield, however the precise reason could not be established. D. Castello et al. [32] verified this behavior by means of model substances. They conducted experiments in a continuous system at 400°C and 25MPa using phenol and glucose mixtures with different phenol concentrations (Fig. 1 ). The results clearly show that glucose gasification is hindered in the presence of phenol. Accordingly, the concentration of hydrogen in the gas product was lowered for the mixtures with the highest phenol concentrations. Yet, the inhibitory effect of the phenol was more notorious on the organic products soluble in water than on the gases. The explanation was that phenols interfere with the glucose degradation mechanism, favoring dehydration reactions (and thereby the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; 5-HMF). M. Sasaki et al. [33–35] studied the decomposition mechanism of cellulose at hydrothermal conditions and short reaction times. They found that the degradation path is different at supercritical than at subcritical conditions and that at temperatures below the critical point of water the decomposition rate of the hydrolysis products of cellulose is faster than hydrolysis of cellulose itself. Contrarily, under supercritical conditions most of the gasification products of cellulose (i.e. glucose, fructose, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentose, and cellohexose) are favored due to a homogeneous hydrolysis of cellulose promoted by its highly solubility and fast hydrolysis rates [34]. Sasaki et al. studied further the kinetics of cellulose at sub- and supercritical conditions and proposed a model to describe a more detailed reaction mechanism. By measuring the products from cellulose hydrolysis, they observed that microcrystalline cellulose was converted into saccharides and a water-insoluble precipitate at subcritical conditions. At longer reaction times, these consecutive products were hydrolyzed into glucose degradation products (fructose, erythrose, 5-HMF, glycolaldehyde, glycerolaldehyde). At temperatures above the critical point, cellulose was rapidly converted into the water-insoluble precipitate and saccharides, but the amount of glucose degradation products increased only slowly or not at all, even at long reaction times. Analyzing the solid precipitate, it was found that it was composed of two different types of crystals, namely cellulose I and II, but cellulose II was only present in the precipitate obtained at supercritical conditions. In their model, the authors proposed that at subcritical conditions hydrolysis takes place on the particle surface of cellulose I and at near- or supercritical conditions the crystallites swell or dissolve prior to a recrystallization that leads to the formation of cellulose II [35]. L.K. Tolonen et al. [36–38] studied this “swelling and dissolving mechanism” of cellulose microcrystallites at sub- and supercritical conditions in a bench scale, tubular batch reactor. At subcritical conditions, complete decomposition of cellulose occurred within the first six seconds, which is comparable with the findings of Sasaki et al. [34], who reported an almost full conversion after 7.3s. Analogous to Sasaki et al. [35], the work of Tolonen et al. [36] showed that the crystallinity of microcrystalline cellulose remained unchanged at subcritical temperatures. At supercritical temperatures, they proposed that the transformation of cellulose Iβ to cellulose II would be observed if swelling took place. They could identify that the precipitate was composed of cellulose II, the formation of which led to an increase of the solubility of the cellulose chains. Also, they found out that hydrolysis with consecutive dissolution takes place at temperatures as low as to 300°C. At supercritical conditions, the initial cellulose crystallites were destructed after swelling due to the lower crystallinity degree; however, given experimental limitations, the data obtained was insufficient to distinguish between swelling and dissolution. In a later study [38], the authors identified the compounds produced after the dissolution of the microcrystalline cellulose. The main products detected were polymers insoluble in water at standard temperature and pressure, soluble oligosaccharides, monosaccharides as well as products from dehydration and aldol condensation reactions of glucose. At supercritical conditions, depolymerization of dissolved cellulose occurs not only via heterogeneous hydrolysis, but also by “homogeneous” random glycosidic bond cleavage. This is a consequence of the swelling ability of supercritical water, which enables cellulose hydrolysis not only at the polymer chain ends but also along a chain. Finally, Tolonen et al. recommend supercritical conditions to favor the dissolution of cellulose but to employ subcritical conditions for the hydrolysis of the soluble oligomers. They also suggest short reaction times at subcritical conditions, given the fact that at these conditions dehydration reactions are promoted because of the high proton concentration. The degradation of cellulose was described by a simple two step mechanism via dissolved polymers to water-soluble products [38], It should be mentioned here that the studies of Tolonen at al. were conducted in a special apparatus enabling very fast heating rates, which are achieved by mixing the feedstock with preheated supercritical water. As just discussed, the decomposition of cellulose is different at subcritical and supercritical conditions. However, to reach the supercritical state, the water/biomass mixture must be heated up passing the subcritical region, which explains why the products of hydrothermal liquefaction are also found as intermediates during SCWG. The reaction path that describes the cellulose decomposition is as follows: for temperatures lower than 200°C, the long cellulose chains are hydrolyzed into water-soluble sugars (i.e. glucose). Under subcritical conditions at temperatures lower than 350°C, glucose reacts further into levoglucosan or into fructose, which continues to react into 5-HMF and furfurals by water elimination. Hydrogenation of HMF can lead to the formation of levulinic and formic acid that finally decompose into gaseous products, or HMF can rearrange and form stable phenols. Smaller molecules from glucose and from fructose, formed via aldol splitting, are also present. At supercritical conditions, gaseous products are formed [15,17,39]. Cellulose hydrolysis in supercritical water was studied in more depth by M.J. Cocero et al. [40–42] in a pilot plant with a continuous tube reactor. They proposed a reaction mechanism and developed a kinetic model to explain and predict cellulose decomposition at near critical temperatures. They found an increase of the reaction rate for the cellulose hydrolysis above the critical point of water because of cellulose dissolved in water. This means that the reaction occurs in a homogenous mixture and, thus, mass transfer limitations and the yield of large oligosaccharides are avoided. At lower temperatures, cellulose is not dissolved; therefore, hydrolysis takes place on the particle surface and the main products are oligosaccharides and small saccharides [40]. To explore cellulose hydrolysis at supercritical conditions further, the authors conducted experiments by changing the initial concentration (and therefore the solubility) of microcrystalline cellulose between 5 and 20% at 400°C and 25MPa. To avoid feedstock decomposition during the heating process, water was pre-conditioned at 450°C and cellulose was heated rapidly by creating a biomass/supercritical water flow mixture ratio of 1:3 at the inlet of the reactor. They determined that at higher concentrations, longer reaction times are needed for a complete cellulose conversion due to mass transfer limitations. At high cellulose concentrations, intermediate glucose production was considerably low. This was also reflected by the formation of other compounds such as glycolaldehyde, a product of the aldol splitting of glucose, or 5-HMF, a fructose dehydration product [41]. At SCWG conditions, 5-HMF mostly decomposes into gases; however, it can also form char particles at higher concentrations [43]. When the objective is gas formation or the production of liquids for further processing, the formation of char should be avoided. 5-HMF production is enhanced at temperatures lower than 300°C (at higher temperatures aldol condensation reactions are favored) by increasing the concentration of H+ in the reaction medium (e.g. by acid addition) or by increasing the pressure. D. Cantero et al. [42] were able to explain quantitatively with a kinetic model why 5-HMF production is low at SCWG conditions. They found that the product selectivity of glucose-to-fructose keto-enol tautomerization and the consecutive water elimination is highly dependent of the H+ and OH− ion concentration. This is the reason for high HMF yields at subcritical conditions. Contrarily, the aldol splitting is less affected by the H+ and OH− ion concentration and, therefore, it can occur in supercritical water, where the ionic product is low. Aldol splitting competes with the formation of 5-HMF and it dominates when the ionic product is low, i.e. when the formation of 5-HMF is less. Hao et al. [44] showed that gasifying cellulose alone leads to low gasification efficiencies of about 50% and to low amounts of hydrogen in the gas mixture. When the cellulose is mixed with low-concentration sodium carboxymethylcellulose and a Ru/C catalyst, the efficiency improves significantly and the amount of hydrogen in the gas phase increases up to four times. Similar results were presented by P. Azadi et al. [45], however they found that nickel-based catalysts compared to ruthenium-based catalysts showed higher activity and more hydrogen selectivity. Especially Ni/α-Al2O3 and Ni/hydrotalcite led to higher hydrogen concentration in the gas products. This study showed also that the proportion of H2 gas produced to the amount of hydrogen available in the feed is approximately the same for xylan and cellulose."
4,Monosaccharides as biomass components and as consecutive products of hemicellulose and cellulose,"2.3 Monosaccharides as biomass components and as consecutive products of hemicellulose and cellulose Monosaccharides have been studied to understand the homogeneous hydrolysis of more complex carbohydrates such as cellulose and xylan. These compounds are also interesting for feedstock richer in starch, with a high carbohydrate content like fruit, corn or cassava residues. Sugars like glucose or fructose have been acknowledged as model substances and the results are usually related to high hydrogen yields since they are more soluble in water and, thus, more readily available for conversion into H2. The most relevant model substance is glucose, as a direct intermediate of cellulose hydrolysis and as an abundant biomass component [46–51]. H.R. Holgate et al. [46] found that at temperatures above 550°C more than 97% of glucose decomposed primarily into acetic acid, acetonylacetone, propenoic acid, and acetaldehyde available in the liquid phase and into H2 and CO2 present in the gas phase. The water-soluble compounds can be further gasified into hydrogen, CO, CO2, and methane. The results obtained by A. Sınağ et al. [49] introduced a scheme of glucose decomposition under supercritical conditions. They proposed a mechanism with two reaction paths for the glucose conversion, which consists of a hydrolytic depolymerization followed by cleavage reactions to form short-chain aldehydes and acids, or by dehydration and ring closures to form furfural derivatives or phenols. The low molecular weight compounds decompose further to gases. A. Sınağ et al. [49] also measured a gas phase composed mainly of H2 and CO2 and higher yields at 500°C than at 400°C. Additionally, the amount of hydrogen can be improved in the presence of potassium salts, because potassium acts as a catalyst for the water-gas shift reaction (Reaction (2)). This favors the hydrogen production and suppresses the formation of furfural derivatives. This effect was also observed by X.H. Hao [48] after gasifying glucose with KOH and sodium carbonate in a continuous tubular SCWG reactor. In both cases an increase of the hydrogen amount and a decrease of the CO were detected. Another way to enhance the production of hydrogen from glucose is by mixing an oxidation agent like hydrogen peroxide. By mixing 4.5% of H2O2 to a mixture of anhydroglucose, P. Williams and J. Onwudili [50] achieved hydrogen percentages of up to 34% under supercritical conditions. They also observed that the residence time did not have a significant influence on the amount of total gas produced. R. Susanti et al. [52] experimented with glucose at different temperatures, residence times and initial feedstock concentrations and found that lower concentrations and high temperatures are the key to obtain a high hydrogen yield, which is compatible with the chemical thermodynamics. They also found out that it was possible to obtain almost the values expected at equilibrium conditions at 25MPa, 767°C, and 1.8wt.% of glucose for 60s. In this case the theoretical maximum yield expected was 12mol H2/mol glucose (Eq. (1)) and their result was 10.5–11.2mol H2/mol glucose. Fructose conversion was studied by B.M. Kabyemela et al. [53] as an isomerization product of the decomposition of glucose under sub- and supercritical conditions and short residence times between 0.02s and 2s. They detected the same products measured from the decomposition of glucose under equal conditions (mainly glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone) except for 1,6-anhydroglucose and glucose as isomerization product. These short-chain compounds are important for the hydrogen production, since they can be gasified more easily than long chain compounds [54]. SCWG of fructose was also studied by S. Nanda et al. [55] as model compound contained in fruits and vegetables. They employed a continuous flow tubular reactor and varied temperature, feed concentration, residence time and catalyst type to find the optimum conditions for H2 production. They observed that the hydrogen yield increased with rising temperatures and reaction time, but it decreased with feed concentration. The highest H2 yield obtained was 3.37mol/mol at 700°C (maximum temperature studied) after 60s and with a feed concentration of 4wt%. Regarding the catalyst effect, they studied KOH and NaOH and measured a threefold increase in the H2 yield with a maximum catalyst concentration of 0.8wt%. KOH lead to a slightly higher yield than NaOH. Glucose decomposition itself is already complex for detailed investigations because of the ring formation (5-HMF) and because it possesses two different types of functional groups (hydroxyl and carbonyl groups) [17]. For a better understanding of the glucose decomposition, some authors have studied glycerol as a model substance for carbohydrates. They propose an initial dehydration and pyrolysis into a small fraction of gaseous products and some intermediates like short chain aldehydes, hydroxyacetone, and propanoic acid. These can be reformed or pyrolyzed to produce the main gaseous fraction [56–58]. H. Jin et al. [59] proposed a 3D computational fluid dynamics model coupled with reaction kinetics to describe SCWG of glycerol. Based on their model, hydrogen yield increases significantly with the reactor length, which means with reaction time. They suggest a 1.69m long reactor to obtain 90% carbon efficiency for a reactor wall temperature of 700°C. W. Bühler et al. [56] explored the decomposition of glycerol in near- and supercritical water at different temperatures (350–475°C), pressures (25, 35, or 45MPa) and reaction times (32–165s). They explained the degradation of glycerol by two competing reaction pathways: the first one is driven by ionic reaction steps and dominates at higher pressures and/or lower temperatures. The second one consists of a free radical decomposition and is present at lower pressures and/or higher temperatures. S. Guo et al. [57] investigated the behavior of the SCWG of glycerol in a continuous tubular flow reactor. They obtained 52.0–68.9% molar fraction of hydrogen with no char and tar fractions. They also established that the highest hydrogen yield is achieved in the presence of low concentrations of NaOH (0.1% NaOH delivered 5mol H2/mol glycerol) and high temperatures. At temperatures lower than 400°C, glycerol remained almost unconverted. Hemicellulose is a polymer composed mainly by xylose; therefore, D. Gökkaya et al. [60] chose this sugar for conducting SCWG in a batch reactor for hydrogen production. They obtained slightly more than 1mol/mol of hydrogen in absence of a catalyst and the yield was increased up to 2.5 times in the presence of ruthenium on activated carbon. They also studied nickel on activated carbon, KOH and K2CO3. Ni/C gave the highest methane yield. Both potassium catalysts led to methane and hydrogen yields between the two carbon supported metal catalysts [61]. Lactose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose, was studied by S. Nanda et al. [62] as a model compound for dairy products. They obtained the largest H2 yield (16mol/mol) at 700°C and 25MPa after a reaction time of 60s and a feedstock concentration of 4wt.%. Additionally, the yield was improved to 22.4mol/mol in the presence of Na2CO3 as catalyst. They state also that dairy products can be an adequate feedstock for hydrogen production, despite the presence of proteins and fats."
5,Lignin content,"2.4 Lignin content As it has been already mentioned, biomass with high lignin content leads to lower conversion degrees. The lignin decomposition mechanism begins with the hydrolysis of the main structure into reactive low-molecular-weight fractions, such as phenolic compounds (guaiacol, cathecol, phenol) and formaldehydes. These compounds polymerize into heavier compounds via condensation/cross-linking reactions, leading to char formation [63–65]. Phenols obtained after the hydrolysis of the ether bonds are regarded as kinetically inert and they can survive for a relatively long time at SCWG conditions [39]; however, Z. Fang et al. [66] showed that by adding phenols to a water-lignin mixture the degradation of lignin occurs and polymerization chain reactions are inhibited, which leads to a product composed mostly of oil and a black precipitate with lignin-like character. Other substances like alkali salts [67], butanol [68] or boric acid [69] enhance the depolymerization reactions of lignin, either by encouraging the water-gas shift reaction for hydrogen formation (Reaction (2)), as is the case of alkali salts, or other ways of enhancing depolymerization reactions. Consequently, addition and condensation reactions are not promoted and the char formation is suppressed. This favors the production of lower molecular weight products, which are easier to gasify. Catalysts like nickel or ruthenium also hinder the polymerization reactions and promote the decomposition of aromatics, boosting the gas production [29,70]. The type of lignin also influences the product distribution. Several studies showed that the char amount of softwood gasification is higher than that of hardwood. Due to the larger contents of acetyl groups, guaiacyl-syringyl (hardwood) lignin is easier to hydrolyze than guaiacyl (softwood) lignin [71–73]. The depolymerization of hardwood lignin also involves the elimination of hydrogen and oxygen from the side chains, whereas the depolymerization of guaiacyl lignin involves the reduction of side-chain groups. This involves hydrogen consumption and, therefore, the gas yield decreases [74]. In the case of alkali lignin, the char residue is higher at supercritical conditions than at near-critical conditions since its sub-critical solubility is larger. Lower solubilities promotes the repolymerization and cross-linking reactions that lead to a phenolic biochar [75]. K. Kang et al. [76] used Central Composite Design as methodology to find the process optimum conditions to maximize hydrogen production with alkali Kraft lignin. The results showed that pressure had an insignificant influence on the hydrogen yield and that the optimal temperature, pressure and water-to-biomass ratio were 651°C, 25MPa and 3.9, respectively. This conditions lead to a theoretical hydrogen yield of 1.6mmol/g and it this was confirmed with experiments that resulted in a hydrogen yield of 1.48mmol/g. D. Forchheim et al. [77] observed that the formation of dimeric intermediates (i.e. catechol and guaiacol) is the main constraint during the decomposition of lignin and that the reaction rate of the guaiacol decomposition increases considerably at near-critical conditions. To stimulate the liquefaction of these intermediates, Raney nickel showed to be an adequate promoter of the hydrodeoxygenation of methoxyphenols (guaiacol) at low temperatures. Furthermore, it restrained the char formation. P.E. Savage et al. [78–80] gasified phenol and guaiacol in supercritical water at different temperatures, with and without catalysts to understand the decomposition mechanism. They observed that at higher temperatures (700°C) it was possible to obtain a gas product rich in methane and hydrogen and that the presence of a Ni catalyst enhanced drastically the H2 production. Furthermore, they identified several intermediate compounds from the decomposition of phenols (dibenzofuran and other dimers of phenol) that remain unreacted and are precursors to char formation (Fig. 2 ). They also established a direct relationship between the concentrations of phenol, water (in terms of water density) and the gas composition. This led to the suggestion of two competing reaction paths with reaction orders different than one describe the phenol decomposition: the first one is inhibited by the presence of water (pyrolysis; dominates in the presence of abundant phenol and little water) and the second one is supported by hydrothermal reactions (dominates with abundant water). Black liquor, a mixture of lignin and hemicellulose obtained as byproduct during the pulping process, was studied as precursor for SCWG by C. Cao et al. [81]. The experiments were conducted at different temperatures (300–800°C), reaction times (10–50min) and black liquor concentrations (2.5–9.5wt.%) in an Inconel® 625 batch reactor. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained at the highest temperature with a low initial concentration of feedstock. Based on their results and considering the black liquor production in China, the authors estimate a hydrogen production of up to 12 million tons with a reduction of up to 147 million tons of CO2. Organosolv lignin is the residue from the pulping technique that uses organic solvents to solubilize cellulose and hemicellulose from wood. Processing organosolv lignin has been typically carried out at subcritical conditions to avoid the repolymerization reactions that occur at supercritical conditions and that lead to the formation of char. To understand the behavior of organosolv lignin at supercritical conditions, X. Man et al. [82] proposed reaction mechanism that described its disassembly through two schemes: scheme 1 involves the hydrolysis and dealkylation of the polymeric structure composed of guaiacyl glycerols into formaldehyde and low molecular weight compounds (anisol, guaiacol, catechols). Scheme 2 involves cross-linking reactions between phenols and formaldehyde, which leads to larger compounds, and between phenols and methyl and ethyl ions forming methyl or ethyl benzenes. A. Yamaguchi et al. [83] studied different catalysts for SCWG of Organosolv lignin. The results showed that Ru(NO)(NO3)3/C led to the highest total gas yield (75%) but the hydrogen content was poor (3.1%). On the other hand, RhCl3/C led to a relatively low gas yield (18.7%) but the hydrogen content was the highest (30.6%). The highest hydrogen selectivity was shown by the ruthenium catalysts. Naturally occurring lignin (protolignin) behaves differently than dissolved and afterward precipitated lignins, since natural lignin has a different structure and no sulfur, which is in most pulp and paper lignins. This was demonstrated by exposing alkali lignin and bark from birch wood with a lignin content between 40–50% to supercritical water gasification with and without catalyst. The results from the birch wood bark showed gasification efficiencies and hydrogen yields comparable to those of carbohydrates at long reaction times [45]. In conclusion, it can be stated that lignin splitting is supported by active hydrogen, which may originate from the carbohydrates in biomass. This may lead to a hydrogen yield decrease, if the conversion is incomplete."
6,Proteins,"2.5 Proteins The hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids at supercritical conditions is a relatively slow process due to the stability of the peptide bond. The decomposition rate depends on the amino acid type, however the reaction follows a general scheme with two competing paths: decarboxylation, which leads to the formation of carbonic acid and amines, and deamination, which leads to the formation of ammonia and organic acids [84]. This was confirmed by the simplified reaction mechanism presented by K. Kang et al. [85,86] after studying fish entrails for the recovery of amino acids in sub- and supercritical water. They observed that after the hydrolysis of the protein chains mainly alanine and glycine were stable at subcritical conditions. In contrast, at supercritical conditions they rapidly decompose and were not detectable any more. Instead organic acids like lactic, acetic, and formic acid were detected. The decarboxylation of acetic acid together with the decarbonylation and decarboxylation of formic acid leads to the gas formation (Reactions (5)–(7) [87]: Decarboxylation of acetic acid: (5) CH3 COOH→CH4 +CO2 Decarbonylation and decarboxylation of formic acid: (6) HCOOH→CO+H2O (7) HCOOH→CO2 +H2 A. Kruse et al. [87] studied the differences between the decomposition of biomass rich in carbohydrates and rich in proteins at supercritical conditions. They experimented with real biomass using phyto (mixture of carrots and potatoes finely chopped) and zoo (finely chopped mixture of mainly cooked rice and chicken) biomass and encountered a low gas production from the zoo biomass together with severe corrosion of the reactor. To explain the unexpected low gas yield and after discarding a possible inhibition of the decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions, they proposed a possible formation of free radical scavengers via the Maillard reaction that inhibit free radical chain reactions. The gas production was considerably improved after adding K2CO3, due to the catalysis of the water-gas shift reaction and by reducing the feedstock concentration. For a better understanding of the protein decomposition at supercritical conditions, the authors employed glucose, alanine and K2CO3 as a model mixture for the zoo biomass and glucose with K2CO3 to represent phyto biomass. The results showed a similar behavior as with real biomass, since the gas formation in the presence of alanine was low. This led to the conclusion that glucose interacts with proteins or with its derivatives and form nitrogen containing free radical scavengers that inhibit the gas production via free radical chain reactions [88]. S. Changi et al. [89] studied phenylalanine as model compound together with different salts and with ethyl oleate to understand the degradation of amino acids at subcritical conditions in the presence of fatty acid esters and inorganics. They detected phenylethylamine as the major decomposition product formed via decarboxylation of the phenylalanine. Styrene is formed after the deamination of phenylethylamine, and by phenylethanol, formed via the hydration of styrene (Reaction (8)). (8) The decomposition of phenylalanine was incomplete at mild conditions and the phenylethylamine yield increased with increasing reaction times. At higher temperatures, the conversion degree of phenylalanine was almost complete, the phenylethylamine yield decreased and styrene became dominant. Especially at 350°C there was a significant production of most likely CO2 as well as the formation of higher molecular weight products via oligomerization. The addition of salts showed an improvement of the phenylalanine decarboxylation, especially with NaNO3 and K2HPO4. These salts also supported oligomerization reactions, decreasing the phenylethylamine yield. Regarding the presence of ethyl oleate, a trend between higher concentrations of ester and an increase of the phenylethylamine deamination and of the hydration of the styrene was observed. Conversely, higher concentrations of phenylalanine led to a higher conversion of ethyl oleate due to the acidic nature of phenylalanine in aqueous solutions (pH=5.9 at room temperature), and consequently to higher oleic acid yields. Other model substances provided better performance in terms of gasification efficiencies. Glycine gasified almost completely in the presence of potassium compounds [90]. N. Sato et al. [84] used alanine and its derivatives leucine, phenylalanine, serine, and aspartic acid. They found that the deamination and decarboxylation rates are different, depending on the type of amino acid. Rice silage, a residue from the ethanol distillation process, was used as a model for protein-rich biomass by H.T. Nguyen et al. [91]. Their results showed that SCWG of this feedstock at a constant reactor temperature of 400°C and 26.2MPa was only effective in terms of hydrogen production when Al2O3-supported Ni or Ru were used as catalyst. They also noted an active participation of the water during the process, since the hydrogen and oxygen mass balance yields exceeded 100%. They proposed that the gas production from rice silage follows similar reaction pathways as steam reforming (Reactions (1), (2) and (4)). However, this analogy failed to describe the appearance of C2+ species during the reaction. The formation of these compounds was explained either because of a Fischer-Tropsch-like reaction occurring at high pressures or because of aldol splitting reactions. Despite their high protein content, experiments with algae have shown promising results for hydrogen production under supercritical conditions. Using Nannochloropsis sp., Q. Guan et al. [92] obtained hydrogen concentrations between 4–10mmol/g, with increasing at lower algae concentrations. T. Minowa and S. Sawayama [93] showed the same relationship between feedstock concentration and hydrogen content in the gas product, obtaining up to 35% hydrogen in the gas product with Chlorella vulgaris as feedstock."
7,Lipids,"2.6 Lipids Studies regarding gasification of lipids under supercritical conditions are scarce. At temperatures below the critical point of water, oils and fats convert fast and efficiently into free fatty acids via hydrolysis reactions. R.L. Holliday et al. [94] investigated three types of vegetable oils in sub- and supercritical water. They could hydrolyze soybean, linseed, and coconut oils successfully into a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Hydrolysis occurred within the first 15–20min, yielding conversion of 97% or higher. Saturated (i.e. caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids) and unsaturated acids (oleic and linoleic acids) were found to be relatively stable at subcritical conditions; however, linoleic acid concentration (cis,cis,cis isomer) was reduced due to isomerization reactions. These reactions increased with the temperature and the preferred isomers formed were trans,cis,cis and trans,trans,cis. Under supercritical conditions, fatty acids were thermally degraded via decomposition, pyrolysis, or polymerization [94]. At these conditions, a free radical splitting can be assumed as the main decomposition mechanism that leads to many different compounds. P.E. Savage et al. [95] used ethyl oleate to model the hydrolysis and esterification reactions of lipids under subcritical conditions. At temperatures of 150°C–300°C and for reaction times between 5–1440s. The authors proposed an autocatalytic process instigated by the carboxylic acids produced during the reaction. The reverse esterification reaction is encouraged when high concentrations of ethanol, a product of the hydrolysis, are present. In a later study, it was shown that both hydrolysis and esterification reactions are acid catalyzed. In the case of the hydrolysis, oleic acid is the main catalyst and, contrary to the initial thoughts, water does not play a catalytic role. They also defined the protonation by H+ and by oleic acid as the rate limiting steps for hydrolysis, when no acid has been added. Regarding esterification, H+ is the sole cause for the catalytic effect and the rate limiting step is the protonation of the oleic acid by H+ [96]. E.A. Youssef et al. [97] conducted a research on oleic acid at temperatures between 400–500°C, pressure of 280bar and 30min reaction time. They observed that high hydrogen yields were possible at 500°C and in the presence of a pelletized Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. Without the catalyst, most of the oleic acid remained unconverted but with acidic catalysts and high temperature the conversion increased dramatically. The decomposition mechanism of oleic acid in supercritical water was explained as an initial hydrolysis of the oleic acid into long chain and volatile fatty acids followed by the dehydrogenation of the saturated compounds to form olefins. The products of the hydrolysis undergo decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions to produce CO and CO2, and the olefins decompose further into hydrogen."
8,Real feedstock and the role of mineral salts,"2.7 Real feedstock and the role of mineral salts Biomass is a complex substance composed not only by cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, but also by extractives and minerals which have an impact on both the hydrogen yield and selectivity. The presence of inorganics in biomass, especially of alkali metals, influences the hydrogen production due to a catalytic effect of the water-gas shift reaction. This means that the SCWG of biomass reaches equilibrium faster than model compounds without catalytic additions. The following section presents examples of SCWG of biomass and biomass derivatives (e.g. hydrochar 2 2 Hydrochar is the product of the hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. ) and how it affected on the hydrogen yield. As biomass with a high carbohydrate content, corn, corn starch, potato starch, potato or cassava are the common study subjects. M.J. Antal et al. [98] experimented with potato and corn starch, and potato wastes as feedstock, and obtained hydrogen contents ranging from 26% to 57%. They could establish that high temperatures (higher than 700°C) are necessary to increase the hydrogen yield at the expense of methane. This is consistent with the process thermodynamics and with the results obtained at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe [99], where they compared real biomass (corn silage and clover grass) with corn starch and they found that an almost total conversion of the biomass can be achieved at >700°C. Cassava root was compared with starch, cellulose and glucose by P. Williams and J. Onwudili [100]. Similar amounts of char were produced with cassava as with starch and hydrogen conversion ratios were comparable those of cellulose. Glucose showed the best performance under the same conditions. Recent studies of SCWG of carbohydrate rich biomass includes the conversion of fruit pulp with Ru/C catalyst [101] or fruit waste and other agricultural residues with alkali catalysts [102]. E. Kipcak et al. [103] gasified olive mill wastewater (OMW) in a coiled tubular reactor at five different reaction temperatures (400–600°C) and five different reaction times (30–150s) without a catalyst. OMW is characterized by having 83–96% water and 3.5-15% organic compounds and polyphenols, therefore it is a desirable feedstock for energy recovery by means of SCWG. The OMW used in this experiment had 6138mg/l TOC, 6168mg/l TC and 3.70mg/l of phenols. The optimum conditions to obtain the most energy-rich gas were 550°C, 250MPa, and 30s. At these parameters, the formation of methane was favored (34.84 mol%), and the hydrogen production restrained (9.23 mol%). The highest amount of hydrogen (10.79 mol%) was obtained at 600°C, 250MPa, and 60s. The gasification efficiency of wine distillery wastes (wastewater and wine grape slurry) under supercritical conditions has been studied in a diamond anvil cell to visualize the process and to analyze the products. The wastewater (effluent) was composed of 95% water and less than 5% of particles suspend. The wine grape slurry was 48.3% water 9.0% minerals and the rest was organic matter. The images obtained with a CCD camera showed different behavior for wastewater and grape slurry: both have in common that the sample decomposition begins after supercritical conditions are attained. At high concentrations of both materials, a carbonization reaction was observed, and a complete conversion was only achieved with small quantities of waste water [104]. The gasification experiments were conducted at 25MPa and three different reaction temperatures (400°C, 450°C, and 500°C). The highest gas efficiency was obtained from the waste water at the highest temperature with a very high methane yield (64.9 mol%) and the lowest hydrogen yield of the whole set of experiments (11.2 mol%). The hydrogen production from wine grape slurries was nearly constant with the temperature and the highest concentration was obtained from the most diluted wine grape slurry (24.8 mol%) [105]. Also other studies show a significant influence of the type of biomass [106]. Products derived from biomass such as hydrochar [107,108] and switchgrass biocrude 3 3 Biocrude is a common name for a liquid/tarry product mixture produced by thermochemical conversion of biomass. [109] have also been gasified under supercritical conditions. The results in terms of hydrogen production were not as promising as when using raw biomass. The switchgrass biocrude is an aqueous solution of oxygenated hydrocarbons (1.0-1.3wt.% carbon) obtained by treating switchgrass in subcritical water at 300°C and 100bar for 30min. The gasification process of the biocrude was conducted in a tube furnace at 600°C and in the presence of different metallic catalysts (Ru, Ni and Co) supported either on TiO2 or ZrO2. All catalysts except for Ru/ZrO2 were suitable for hydrogen production, due to an extensive char formation and the highest observed hydrogen yield of 0.98mol H2/mol C was obtained with Ni/ZrO2, as was the lowest methane yield [109]. D. Castello et al. [108] were the first to study the potential of hydrochar by gasifying it in 5ml micro-autoclaves at 400°C and 30MPa for different reaction times (1–16h). The hydrochar was obtained by carbonizing maize silage for 5h at 215°C and 2.4MPa in 5ml stainless steel micro-autoclaves. They found out that hydrochar can be effectively gasified, however the hydrogen content in the gas phase is very poor due to the low reactivity of the hydrochar. P.E. Savage et al. [107] gasified lipid-extracted algal hydrochars at temperatures between 450°C and 600°C at different reaction times. The highest hydrogen yield reported was at 500°C after 10min and an apparent activation energy for hydrogen formation of 97±12kJ/mol was estimated, which resulted to be indistinguishable from that of hydrogen formation from microalgae. This indicates that the hydrogen production by SCWG of hydrochar from microalgae is not significantly more difficult than that from algal biomass [92]. For char gasification also a kinetic model is presented [110]. Understanding hydrochar gasification is of special importance, because hydrothermal carbonization [111] was identified as unwanted side reaction during SCWG [112–114]. This reaction becomes increasingly dominant at higher concentrations or dry matter content, likely because of a higher reaction order and it leads to a gas yield decrease. This effect can be avoided by using a continuous stirred tank reactor as well as by the catalytic action of potassium salts. Here, high reaction order pathways are suppressed and the hydrogenation of reactive intermediates (5-HMF) is promoted. Consequently, unwanted polymerization and char formation are avoided [113,114]. Other researchers have studied algae gasification: Norouzi et al. [115] studied the conversion of Enteromorpha intestinalis with an iron-nickel catalyst, Tiong et al. compared Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus quadricauda with and without a Ni-catalyst [106] and Krishnan et al. compared three different micro algae with and without catalysts and salts [116]. In view of algae conversion also an AspenPlus process simulation was published, showing “overall energetic efficiency from 34.2 to 46.2%, in the fuel-equivalent efficiency from 44.1 to 55% and exergetic efficiency from 28.9 to 41.4%” [117]. A process design study investigated in detail the influence of reaction conditions and suggested lower temperatures and higher concentrations of micro algae for process optimization [118]. Concerning algae conversion, water recycling is of special interest for process efficiency. In the study of Elsayed et al. [119] recycling of water after SCWG was not successful because of an incomplete gasification. Here, the cultivation of microalgae was possible after the process water was treated with activated carbon and UV radiation. One important advantage of SCWG is that it is not limited to lignocellulosic biomass. Studies have shown promising results using sewage sludge gasification [120–123] and the review from C. He et al. [124] summarizes previous research work related to this feedstock. Sewage sludge is a complex material composed by carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, aromatic compounds, heavy metals, and inorganics. Due to this complexity, it is difficult to establish a trend or a specific reaction path that explains its decomposition. Hydrogen yields as high as 76vol.% have been reported in [125] when gasifying sewage sludge at 450°C and 34MPa for 1h in a batch reactor with 3g of NaOH as catalyst. Gasification in the absence of catalyst also led to relatively high yields: H. Schmieder et al. [90] obtained 49vol.% H2 after gasifying sewage sludge at 450°C and a pressure between 315 and 350bar during 2h and this amount remained practically unaffected after using K2CO3 as catalyst. Recently, N. Boukis et al. gasified digestate sludge, a by-product of the anaerobic digestion of biomass, in the pilot plant VERENA using a Ru/C catalyst protected by a bed of ZnO to remove sulfur compounds and potassium hydrogen carbonate to catalyze the water gas shift reaction [126]. They obtained a gas product with 16% H2, which was comparable with the results obtained from the gasification of pure substances (glycerol and ethanol) also conducted by the authors in this study. Alkali metals are an essential component of the mineral matter in biomass and several studies have confirmed their catalytic effect over the water-gas shift reaction (Reaction (2)). This reaction is the key reaction for the hydrogen production during hydrothermal biomass gasification. If this reaction is promoted, the hydrogen production will also increase [3,90,127–129]. The presence of “active hydrogen” that can react with reactive intermediates leads to the formation of short chain compounds, which contribute to the gas production [17]. To prove this, several salts (Na2CO3, KHCO3, K2CO3, NaOH, etc.) have been added to model substances to determine their effect on the product distribution. A. Kruse et al. [39] studied the role of intermediates during SCWG since they are responsible for the formation of aromatic rings, and they also react with the hydrogen from the water-gas shift reaction altering the distribution of the gaseous product. C4 compounds (1-butanal, 1-butanol, and cis-butendiol) with different functional groups that are known to be present during SCWG of biomass were used as model components under addition of K2CO3. At the reaction conditions of 500°C and 50MPa the gasification behavior of all compounds was very similar: H2 and CO2 were predominant and the amount of CO was below 2% due to the catalytic effect of the alkali salt. The reaction of all compounds led to the formation of phenols and other aromatic rings found in the water phase. D.C. Elliott [4,5] demonstrated that alkali metal salts have a stronger catalytic effect than similar alkaline earth compounds and they proposed a base catalyzed mechanism for the water-gas shift reaction that involves a cyclic system with three intermediate anions: carbonate, hydroxide, and formate. The carbonate anion together with water leads to the formation of the hydroxide and CO2. The hydroxide reacts with CO to produce formate, which in turn decomposes to carbonates and formaldehyde. The decomposition of the formaldehyde generates hydrogen. Watanabe et al. [130–132] proposed an ionic mechanism where the hydroxyl ion promotes the oxidation of CO to CO2. They also reported the catalytic effect of NaOH by gasifying formaldehyde, n-hexadecane (n-C16) and organosolv-lignin under supercritical conditions in a batch reactor at 400°C. In both cases, the addition of the alkali metal was followed by an increase of the hydrogen yield. At subcritical conditions, the formation of methane is thermo- dynamically favored and hydrogen produced is simultaneously consumed for the methane formation. G. Akgül and A. Kruse [6] studied the influences of NaHCO3 and KHCO3 on the water-gas shift reaction at different pressures and temperatures at subcritical conditions. Different concentrations of salts together with CO/H2O mixtures at a constant ratio of 0.004 and different concentrations of CO were heated up in a reactor with a ceramic liner to avoid catalytic effects of the reactor material. The gas composition showed a significant increase of the hydrogen production with higher temperatures and in the presence of salts. High pressures have a similar effect; however, it is less drastic compared to the temperature effects. The aqueous phase was analyzed for formic acid, since it was assumed to be an intermediate of the water-gas shift reaction [133]. The concentration of formic acid increased with temperature up to 250°C and then decreases. These results support the hypothesis that the water-gas shift reaction is indeed catalyzed by alkali salts, but there was no evidence for a based catalyzed mechanism or for a transformation from formic acid to formate as actual accelerating factor [6]. A. Sınağ et al. [129] analyzed glucose as a model compound for cellulose in the presence of K2CO3 to understand the effect of alkali salts and reported a notable increase of the hydrogen yield and a slight decrease of phenols concentration. They also compared the effect of Ni-Raney catalyst with K2CO3 and observed a higher hydrogen yield in the presence of the salt than of the metal catalyst. On the other hand, the methane yield was higher with nickel due to the catalysis of the hydrogenation reaction [134]. In another study the effect of the biomass nature in the presence of K2CO3 on the product distribution was analyzed using zoo mass, phyto mass, phyto mass with K2CO3 and glucose with K2CO3 in a batch reactor at 500°C and 30MPa with a reaction time of 1h. An increase of hydrogen was also reported for the mixtures containing K2CO3. However, in the case of pure phyto and zoo mass, the catalytic effect on the water-gas shift reaction was less pronounced due to differences in the composition of their mineral content [128]. Several recent papers also describe the classical catalytic activity of potassium [101,102,106,110,116–119,135]. A study regarding gasification of carbohydrates, aromatic compounds, glycine as a model compound for proteins and with real biomass in two tubular flow reactors and in two batch autoclaves showed that by adding KOH or K2CO3 to the mixture the gasification of the feedstock was almost complete at temperatures higher than 550°C. These conditions led also to a gas composition with a high percentage of H2 and CO2 and low CO content [90]."
9,Heterogeneous catalyst,"As mentioned above, salts have a significant effect on biomass gasification at supercritical conditions. In addition, the effects of solid catalysts have been widely investigated. In view of the basic chemical equations discussed in the introduction, the Reactions (2) and (4) need a catalyst because of their high activation energy. Reaction (2) can be catalyzed either by alkali salts or by heterogeneous catalyst like metals. Concerning hydrogen production, the reverse Reaction of (4) is of special interest. Methane and other hydrocarbons, also aromatics from lignin to a certain extent, need catalysts to be cleaved and, consecutively, to form hydrogen. In this case, typical hydrogenation catalysts like Ni, Rd, Pt, etc. are the typical choice. Also, unwanted side reactions between reactive intermediates (polymerization and char/coke formation) can be suppressed by hydrogenation of reactive groups because of the interaction by active hydrogen. All in all, the goal is to improve hydrogen selectivity and, if possible, to decrease the reaction temperature. D.C. Elliott et al. [136] confirmed that, in order to break up the polymeric organics in biomass and to produce gas effectively under conditions close to the critical point, the active metal catalysts that worked best were nickel, ruthenium, and rhodium, which improve the methanation reaction. Catalysts also enhance the segmentation of long chains into shorter and more degradable compounds. This ability is of extreme importance to produce hydrogen and the work presented by A.G. Chakinala et al. [54] supports this. They gasified several carboxylic acids and alcohols with different chain length and established a relation between the gasification efficiency, the chain length, the increasing number of single bond −OH groups, and the positioning of these groups. Nickel-based catalysts are widely used in SCWG since their performance and activity is comparable to that of the noble metals but they are relatively low-priced [73,91,137]. Additionally, nickel promotes the hydrogenation reaction and it supports the formation of CO and H2 from biomass, which in turn can form CH4 and CO2 via the methanation reaction. The catalytic effect of nickel leads to a high carbon gasification efficiency but the hydrogen production is suppressed by the consumption for hydrogenation [138]. This is supported by the results presented by A. Sınağ et al. [134] in their experiments with glucose under supercritical conditions in the presence of Raney nickel and K2CO3. They observed that Raney nickel promoted the degradation of intermediates (phenols, formic acid, and acetic acid) leading to high methane production. In contrast, hydrogen formation predominated with K2CO3 due to its catalytic effect on the water-gas shift reaction. M. J. Sheikhdavoodi et al. [138] investigated the catalytic effect of Raney nickel with that of alkali metals and activated carbon with the aim of maximizing hydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse in supercritical water. They verified that the presence of a catalyst is necessary to obtain a high hydrogen yields with KOH and NaOH, yielding the highest amount (6.6 and 5.6mol/g respectively). Raney nickel showed the highest carbon conversion efficiency but the hydrogen production was poor compared to the results obtained in the presence of alkali metals (1.3mol/g). P. Azadi and R. Farnoon [139] explained this in their review by claiming that Raney nickel catalysts strongly promote the CO bond cleavage and, if it is employed for the gasification of oxygenated compounds, it will react with some of the produced hydrogen resulting in a methane-rich gas mixture (hydrogenation of CO). One way of boosting the hydrogen production when using a nickel catalyst is by modifying its surface, also by variation of the support material. P. Azadi et al. [45] compared the catalytic activity of Raney nickel, Ni/α-Al2O3 and Ni/hydrotalcite with Ru/C and Ru/γ-Al2O3 as well as their impact on the hydrogen selectivity of SCWG of glucose, cellulose, fructose, xylan, pulp, lignin and bark. They showed that using Ni/α-Al2O3 and Ni/hydrotalcite not only resulted in a higher hydrogen selectivity but also in a higher production. The authors argue that these catalysts have lower nickel dispersions and lower number of Ni-defect sites compared to Raney nickel. The same is valid for the ruthenium catalysts, which could imply that the methanation reaction in supercritical water is susceptible to structural arrangements (i.e. defect sites) on the catalyst surface. In another study, the authors [140] investigated the effect of the catalyst concentration on when gasifying glucose, glycine, glycerol, lauric acid, and humic acid, representing carbohydrates, proteins, alcohols, fatty acids, and humic substances respectively. Their results showed that both carbon and hydrogen efficiencies increased with an increasing catalyst load until they stabilize at about 0.4g catalyst/g feed. A similar trend was found by the hydrogen and methane yields. The nickel catalyst strongly promotes the CO bond cleavage as well as the hydrogenation of the produced carbon dioxide. These two reactions lead to the higher methane production; however, it also corresponds to a lower hydrogen selectivity. Despite its advantages, the deactivation of nickel catalysts by tar forming products or carbon deposition, especially if it is an alumina supported catalyst, cannot be avoided [19,73,141]. To overcome this problem, S. Li et al. [142] showed that it is possible to produce large amounts of hydrogen from glucose SCWG using co-precipitated NiMgAl catalysts to avoid the formation of a char layer, which leads to the deterioration of the catalyst. They tested different molar ratios of Mg/Al and their results showed not only higher hydrogen yields of 912%, but also a higher hydrogen selectivity at a lower carbon gasification efficiency. This study also confirmed that Mg could increase the life span of the catalyst by hindering the graphite formation on the acid sites of alumina due to its anti-carbon ability. Also, the findings presented by Y. Lu et al. [143,144] showed that the catalyst support not only affects the hydrogen production and selectivity but also the durability of the catalyst. They experimented with supported nickel catalysts by impregnating the alumina support with different metal oxides, establishing a sequence based on the catalytic activity for hydrogen production (CeO2/Al2O3 >La2O3/Al2O3 >MgO/Al2O3 >Al2O3 >ZrO2/Al2O3) and for hydrogen selectivity (CeO2/Al2O3 >La2O3/Al2O3 >ZrO2/Al2O3 >Al2O3 >MgO/Al2O3). Besides, they found that the CeO2/Al2O3 support serves as a carbon remover on the catalyst surface, probably because CeO2 is capable of oxidizing char deposited on the surface due to its high oxygen storage capacity and oxygen mobility. A similar study was published by Kang et al. for the gasification of lignin with nickel based catalysts [145]. Nobel metals such as palladium, ruthenium or rhodium have a high catalytic activity and are the most studied catalysts, since they have shown a great potential for enhancing the hydrogen production in SCWG systems [146–151]. Ruthenium catalyzes hydrogenation reactions, and therefore low hydrogen yields as found in [45]. Ruthenium, however, is the key catalyst for obtaining high gas yields from proteinaceous feedstock since, based on the findings of H.T. Nguyen et al. [91], it shows a higher catalytic activity per metallic mass compared to nickel. Also, A. Yamaguchi et al. [149] employed ruthenium, rhodium, platinum, palladium, and nickel as carbon supported catalysts during SCWG of organosolv-lignin to study their impact on the hydrogen production and they found a related to the gas yield based on carbon: Ru>Rh>Pt>Pd>Ni. Even though Ru and Pd showed the best and worst performances in terms of gas production, they showed the poorest and highest hydrogen selectivity respectively. This leads to the assumption that lignin is first converted to hydrogen and CO, followed by the methanation reaction. This was also proven by measuring the gas composition vs. time, where it was found out that the hydrogen and CO concentration decrease whereas the CH4 concentration increases. They also identified a sequence related to the hydrogen yield: Pd>Ru>Pt>Rh>Ni. M. Osada et al. investigated the performance of the SCWG of lignin [147,148] and sugarcane bagasse [150] for hydrogen production in the presence of several supported ruthenium catalysts. They discovered that when repeatedly using the same supported Ru catalysts, the hydrogen yield was increased while the methane yield decreased. They also reported that the presence of sulfur hinders the lignin gasification by decreasing the gas yield, probably provoked by a lower number of active ruthenium sites available after the adsorption of sulfur impurities. On the other hand, the hydrogen selectivity is improved (4.8% H2 for Ru/C catalyst with sulfur and 3.4% H2 without sulfur). Sugarcane bagasse, an agricultural residue with a high lignin content, showed promising results after being completely gasified under supercritical conditions in the presence of Ru/C and Ru/TiO2 catalyst as well as producing higher hydrogen yields: 0.48mmol/g in the absence of a catalyst, 3.22mmol/g with Ru/TiO2 and 1.92mmol/g with Ru/C. Recently different new catalysts were tested and results have shown a positive effect of La- catalysts [152]. Jin et al. tested a bimetallic catalyst prepared at hydrothermal conditions for the gasification of furfural [153]. Also a TiO2 catalyst was produced this way [154]. For lignin gasification, recently a Ni-Co/Mg-Al catalyst was investigated [155]. A detailed kinetic analysis was presented for Ru/Al2O3 with glucose [156]. Instead of using a heterogeneous catalyst, biomass can be impregnated with nickel to get higher yields [157]. Carbonaceous materials have been also tested as catalysts and as catalysts supports due to their high surface area, stability in supercritical water, low-costs, and less corrosion problems as with metallic catalysts. To the author’s knowledge, M.J. Antal and his research group [158] were the first to publish results on SCWG with carbonaceous materials as catalyst. They studied the effects of spruce wood charcoal, macadamia shell charcoal, coal activated carbon, and coconut shell activated carbon on the gas formation from several feedstocks in supercritical water. They showed that the presence of a carbonaceous material increased the carbon gasification efficiency independently of its surface area, but in terms of hydrogen production, a higher surface area apparently did not promote the water-gas shift reaction, therefore the H2 yields are lower. M. J. Sheikhdavoodi et al. [138] confirmed also that the use of activated carbon led to higher carbon efficiencies than the gasification without a catalyst. Activated carbon showed a higher catalytic activity than Raney nickel in terms of hydrogen production but not as high as that of alkali metal catalysts. As the unwanted side reaction of SCWG leads to hydrochar formation. This hydrochar was investigated as catalyst for the gasification of macroalgae. An increase of hydrogen yield, a decrease of acids and an increase of phenols in the aqueous phase were observed as consequence [159]."
10,Water,"Water is the reaction medium and the second main reactant beside biomass, during SCWG [160]. Its unique properties as a supercritical fluid hinder the abundant development of undesired products like char and tar by solvation of intermediates, which are common to traditional dry gasification technologies and leads to lower gasification efficiencies, if not carried out at temperatures close to 1000°C and beyond [43]. With increasing temperatures properties like the density, viscosity, dielectric constant, and the ability to dissolve hydrocarbons and salts changes ([10] and literature cited therein). At supercritical conditions the density of water is approximately 90% less than at atmospheric conditions due to the larger distance between the molecules and less hydrogen bonds. Water is not a network connected with hydrogen bonds anymore, but with clusters [161]. The formation of a more “flexible” structure enables the rather high solubility of non-polar molecule (e.g. [162]). The low density of water at supercritical conditions implies that molecules can move with more freedom due to weaker and less hydrogen bonds, which in turn leads to the decrease of the static dielectric constant and of the viscosity [10]. The low viscosity leads to a faster reaction rate as a result of an improved diffusivity combined with high pressure that is consistent with the kinetic theory of gases [19,163,164]. For biomass to be converted into hydrogen, the large polymeric compounds must hydrolyzed into small oligomers and monomers, which, in turn needs to be solved to get a homogenous phase. For this reason, it is important to understand water as a solvent at supercritical conditions. At these conditions, the solubility of hydrocarbons and inorganics in water is strongly affected by the decrease of solvent polarity, which is explained by the reduction of the dielectric constant of water from 78 at atmospheric conditions to 1,8 at 400°C and 25MPa [10,12]. This makes water to an excellent solvent for organic compounds. On the other hand, for the degradation of cellulose, also swelling by the solvent water is important. Y. Ogihara et al. [165] observed the dissolution of cellulose using a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell. Different temperatures were studied to observe the dependence of the solubility as a function of the density of water. The authors could observe that the cellulose crystallites swelled at densities between 600 and 800kg/m3. At higher densities, the water access in the particles was restricted therefore higher temperatures were needed to observe the swelling. Additionally, the interaction of water with crystalline cellulose at large pressures and high temperatures results in a crystalline to amorphous structural transformation of cellulose (gelatinization) [166–168]. The dissolution of biomass in hot compressed water was studied by Z. Fang et al. using willow [169,170]. The results showed that low-density water was capable of completely dissolving fine wood particles by rapid heating [168] and the addition of alkali salts inhibited the formation of solid products [170]. The authors also observed that at temperatures as low as 200°C, lignin and hemicellulose dissolved and can be separated from the cellulose-rich matrix, which is dissolved at 310°C. Following this process, an almost complete conversion of wood (95%) can be achieved without the unwanted solid products that result from recondensation reactions between the dissolution products of lignin and hemicellulose [169]. This can be stated as a general rule: The high solubility of intermediates depress polymerization. The high or complete solubility of hydrogen supports hydrogenations, further depressing polymerization reactions (see part 2.7). Concerning the solubility of minerals, it decreases drastically at supercritical conditions and salts that are dissolved in water under ambient conditions precipitate as solids or in a separate liquid phase due to the lack of solvation by water molecules [161]. On the other hand, the solubility of organic compounds is enhanced in hot compressed water: small polar and non-polar organic molecules mix completely with the medium, and large organic compounds depolymerize into smaller blocks that continuously react in solution, hindering the char formation and increasing the gas product yield [17,161]. In conclusion, at typical reaction conditions of 550°C and 20MPa water acts as a nonpolar solvent with high solubility for organic compounds and gases but with poor solubility for inorganics. Even though water molecules themselves continue to be polar splitting polar bonds. During hydrothermal gasification, there are two main reaction mechanisms that control the biomass degradation and that depend on the process conditions. This has been demonstrated as a slope change in the Arrhenius plots of the guaiacol and glycerol degradation [77,109]. At sub-critical conditions, products formed via hydrolysis and ionic intermediates and hydrolysis are found. On the other hand, at supercritical conditions the reaction path is controlled by free radical reactions [10]. Another important feature of supercritical water is that it can provide hydrogen, making it an important reactant during the gasification of biomass. In this regard, water acts as gasification agent in the same way as in conventional gasification. However, the more reactive biomass compared to fossil fuels and the properties of water allow for conversion at lower temperatures. B. Kuhlman et al. [171] showed in their research that water plays a crucial role in hydrogen exchange reactions after observing H-D exchange in pinacolone in supercritical D2O as a reaction medium. The exchange mechanism might occur via radical intermediates as proposed by A. Kruse and K.H. Ebert [172]. Furthermore, K.C. Park and H. Tomiyasu [173] established that the hydrogen atoms found in the methane and hydrogen molecule were coming from the water and not from the feedstock. They employed also D2O as solvent and identified deuterium instead of hydrogen atoms in the product gas molecules. The fact that most of the hydrogen comes from the water-gas shift reaction is also supported by the research of A. Kruse et al. [39] after gasifying deuterated glucose with K2CO3 under supercritical conditions. The results showed also the formation of aromatic rings (phenols) with CD-bonds. Additionally, typical glucose degradation products (butanone and cyclopentanone) showed one carbon atom bonded to a deuterium atom, which leads to the conclusion that these products are formed during hydrogenation by H2 formed via the water-gas shift reaction. Reactions (2) show that by shifting the equilibrium to the side of hydrogen, hydrogen yields increase. Still, if only the decomposition of the biomass is considered, SCWG is the most efficient technology to produce high hydrogen yields. This was corroborated by recent molecular dynamic simulations [174]. In this study, H. Jin et al. investigated the reaction mechanism of the gasification of furfural in SCW (Fig. 3 ) and they presented a comparison between dry gasification, steam gasification and SCWG that clearly showed the higher hydrogen and lower CO-content of the gas product of SCWG."
11,Reactor material,"The construction material for reactors employed in SCWG processes should be chosen to endure the high thermal stresses (creep resistance) and the radial and tangential stresses generated by high pressures and temperatures. The most common materials are nickel alloys, like Inconel and Hastelloy, and high-alloyed stainless steels like the grade 316 because of their mechanical properties but also due to their corrosion resistance. D. Yu et al. [51] discovered that the materials employed and the corrosion degree affect the biomass decomposition in supercritical water. Two reactors made of Inconel® 625 and Hastelloy C–276 were used to gasify cellulose. It was detected that the hydrogen production with Inconel was more than 3 times higher than with Hastelloy implying that the water-gas shift reaction is promoted by this material. On the other hand, the corroded Hastelloy walls presented a higher catalytic activity than the new Hastelloy and the hydrogen yield was slightly higher than with Inconel. Bjerre and Sørenesen [175] observed a different behavior for formic acid decomposition in two reactors made by different stainless steels and different operation time (new and aged). They observed that formic acid had a significantly higher conversion degree, and thus a higher hydrogen production, in the corroded and aged autoclave than in the new one. By synthetically aging the new reactor with HF and repeating the reaction, it was proven that corrosion plays a crucial role in the catalysis of the decarboxylation and water-gas shift reactions. On the other hand, J. Yu and P.E. Savage [133] concluded that the effect of the reactor wall was insignificant compared to the catalytic effect of water after examining the influence of the surface-to-volume ratio of a reactor made of Hastelloy C-276 on the reaction rate. The reactor wall effect on the formic acid decomposition has been widely studied as reported in the review by M. Watanabe et al. [176]. They evaluated kinetic data from the works of J. Yu and P. Savage [133] and P.G. Maiella and T.B. Brill [177] to generate an extrapolated Arrhenius plot for supercritical conversion at around 25MPa. The rate constants calculated differed from each other in around 4 orders of magnitude. They attribute these discrepancies to the reactor history and material. D. Castello et al. [178] also found an influence from the reactor wall material when comparing Inconel® 625 with stainless steel 1.4571 during SCWG of glucose and beech wood sawdust at different temperatures and residence times. Their results from SCWG of glucose are like those presented by D. Yu et al. [51], since for short residence times and for all evaluated temperatures the hydrogen yield was higher for Inconel® 625 than for stainless steel. For higher residence times, the hydrogen production in the stainless-steel vessel was significantly higher than in Inconel® 625. The methane production increased constantly in both reactors. After comparing the hydrogen content in the gas, it was observed that the hydrogen selectivity of the stainless steel was higher. A similar behavior in terms of hydrogen production and selectivity was observed in the results of the SCWG of beech wood sawdust. Recently, gasification of black liquor was conducted in stainless steel and Inconel® 625 reactors. The nickel-base alloy showed a higher hydrogen formation at roughly the same carbon efficiency [179]. In gerneral, corrosion is an challenge for SCWG. P. Kritzer et al. [180] studied the corrosion behavior of nickel, molybdenum, chromium and nickel based Alloy 625 at conditions similar to SCWG for reaction times between 0.75h and 50h. They found that nickel and molybdenum were the most vulnerable since they started presenting a strong mass loss after only 5h. This was a consequence of the instability of the solid oxides in the high-temperature oxidizing solution. Corrosion phenomena in chromium and Inconel® 625 started at the grain boundaries. In the case of Inconel® 625 this might be due to high concentrations of phosphorous and silicon on these sites. T. Richard et al. [181] chose to study the viability of ceramics as reactor material, due to their high chemical stability under extreme conditions. They compared the behavior of 33 different ceramic materials under different SCWG scenarios. They found that materials like alumina and Y-stabilized zirconia easily corroded under subcritical conditions and are not suitable for supercritical water. SiC showed a higher stability in the subcritical region but when exposed to supercritical conditions it corroded easily. They established graphite and glassy carbon as suitable materials for reactor construction due to their low chemical reactivity and their tolerance towards high temperatures, however the mechanical stability was not considered."
12,"Operation conditions: temperature, pressure, reaction time, and feedstock concentration","The operation conditions define the strength of the reaction driving forces, i.e. the thermodynamics and kinetics. The calculated gas yields from the decomposition of a glucose/phenol mixture presented by A. Kruse and N. Dahmen [10] predict a nearly complete gasification at different temperatures in the sub- and supercritical regions, but the product distribution depends on the temperature. At low temperatures, the methane formation is preferred and hydrogen dominates at higher temperatures. However, if the feedstock concentration is kept low, the hydrogen production can be enhanced at low temperatures due to the Le Châtelier principle. Reactions (2) and (4) describe the hydrogen and methane formation from glucose and the fundamental role of water to obtain hydrogen instead of methane. Low feedstock concentration implies an excess of water; therefore, the thermodynamic equilibrium can be shifted favoring the water-gas shift reaction and Reaction (1). Contrarily to this and due to its exothermic character, the methane formation dominates at lower temperatures (Reaction (3)). The thermodynamic and kinetic behavior in SCWG have been experimentally and theoretically verified by several groups. A. Kruse et al. [15] determined experimentally that high concentrations of dry matter are detrimental for the hydrogen production, instead they foster the phenol formation. Y. Lu, et al. [182] modeled the thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium of SCWG of biomass. Their results showed that dry matter content (feedstock concentration) hinders the hydrogen production contrary to temperature and pressure, which promote it. They also attempted to experimentally find the optimal process conditions by varying the temperature, pressure, residence time, and feedstock concentration with an orthogonal design to maximize the hydrogen production from corn cob in the absence of catalysts. They confirmed not only that the modeling results agreed with the empiric results, but also that the order in which these parameters affect the hydrogen production in terms of severity: temperature>pressure>feedstock concentration>residence time. With higher temperatures, pressures and residence time the hydrogen yield increases, however the behavior is the opposite in terms of feedstock concentration [183,184]. D. Castello and L. Fiori [185,186] studied the thermodynamics constraints during SCWG of biomass with a non-stoichiometric model. Their results were validated by comparing them with the experiments conducted by A. Byrd et al. [187]. These findings are consistent with the Le Châtelier principle by showing a decrease of the hydrogen yield and an increase of the methane yield with increasing feed concentration. They also showed that char formation becomes relevant at high feedstock concentrations, low temperatures, and/or when using feedstock with a very high carbon content. They proposed a stoichiometric thermodynamic model based on 6 components and 3 independent reactions to describe the SCWG of biomass and emphasized on the conditions that lead to the maximum H2 production. It was found that high temperatures are only necessary to suppress the methanation reaction and not to push the water-gas shift reaction. Additionally, they found a feedstock-dependent factor (ψ) that relates the ratios H/C and O/C to be the determining factor for maximum H2 production per unit mass of feedstock."
13,Challenges and solutions,"The question on what are the main progresses reached in recent years and why it is difficult to place such a technology in the market arises. The main reason why a SCWG process is not attractive for industry today, due to the high processing costs; only biomass with high disposal costs are interesting feedstock [22,188–192]. For example, a review of techniques to convert banana waste in Uganda identifies SCWG as too expensive to be applied by low-income farmers [193]. In general, SCWG is judged to be too expensive [194]. A company might also be mistrustful of the non-conventional high temperature and high pressure applied. Concerning this, a risk analysis might be useful as carried out for SCWG of sewage sludge. In this study, Adar et al. [195] identified plugging, corrosion, reactor design and incomparable material selection as main problems. The primary risks were explosions, injuries by high temperature and malodor by incomplete gasification as well as noise by the pumps. The cause and effect diagram is shown in Fig. 4 . Concerning all risks, there are possibilities to prevent negative effects. Salt deposition and plugging is a challenge. It has been shown that do not only act as homogeneous catalysts, promoting the production of hydrogen; however, they can also work as salt catchers. A. Kruse et al. [196,197] developed a salt-water system (hydrothermal brine) to catch other salts and avoid reactor plugging. This phase successfully captured sodium and other alkali salts that could be further used to produce fertilizers. In the group of F. Vogel, salt separation was investigated in catalytic hydrothermal gasification for methane production. Anyway, the equipment designed for salts separation via sedimentation can be applied also in SCWG for hydrogen production [198]. This was demonstrated by N. Boukis et al. after the gasification of digestate sludge, where they were able to recover up to 80% of phosphate salts and 23% of potassium salts [126]. An improved design uses a concept applied by oxidation in supercritical water: cold water is injected to dissolve the salts in order to remove them [199]. This concept is similar to that of the transpiring wall reactors used in oxidation in supercritical water [200,201]. Promising results showed that a fluidized bed reactor might be good solution also for biomass with high ash content. Pioneer work was conducted by Matsumura et al. with carbon as catalyst transported through the reactor [202,203] and in a fluidized bed [204]. New reactors with a fluidized bed reactor have started working recently [205,206]. In another study, plugging by char formation was suppressed by a fluidized bed of alumina particles [207]. In view of the relative high costs, it is useful to regard SCWG not as a single process but in combinations with others. More than in the past, the idea of integrating the SCWG in a bio-refinery occurs. As an example, the combination of SCWG, or other techniques, with lignin production was suggested for the integration of a regional supply system for biomass [208]. Another idea is the combination with a solid fuel cell [209,210]. From the view of CO2-footprint the combination of SCWG with a supercritical steam turbine as well as with additional with anaerobic digestion was found to be very promising [211] (see Fig. 5 )."
14,Conclusion,"Basis of the activity on SCWG for hydrogen production is the pioneering work of Michael J. Antal. Looking back on more than 30 years of research, the authors state that still most of the newer publications deal with model compounds. A strong focus is on the test of new catalysts and here often glucose is used as feedstock. Only few new studies dealing with real biomass. Here still is basic knowledge missing on the interaction of different biomass components and on the influence of the structure of biomass. On the other hand, there are some studies with lignin, which opens new views inside the chemistry of SCWG. Two years after Michael J. Antal passed away, the hurdles for an industrial application are still the same as from the beginning and addressed in the recent publications: a) To high production cost in comparison with fossil fuel based hydrogen. Here some concepts of integration in process chains or bio-refinery like concepts are introduced. Cost calculation does not focus on hydrogen as product alone and – as consequence – appears more positive in view of an industrial application. In addition, the studies with lignin opens the application in SCWG in pulp and paper industry. b) Unwanted char/coke formation as competing reaction pathway to gasification. Here solid catalysts are applied. To avoid c) not as fixed bed but moving through the reactor or as fluidized bed. The concept of Kruse et al. [114] to use a CSTR to avoid char/coke is not further developed. c) Plugging by salts, because of the low solubility of salts in supercritical water. Here new techniques for salts and supercritical fluidized bed reactors (see b) are introduced. Corrosion is a hurdle as well, but not addressed in detail in this review. Especially in the case of sulfur containing biomass, it must be considered. The future of hydrothermal gasification could be as part of a bio-refinery. As example, during hydrothermal liquefaction and tarry oil and an aqueous phase are the products. The organic compounds in the aqueous effluent can be gasified and the hydrogen is used for up-grading the oil. In another study the aqueous effluent of algae hydrothermal liquefaction was partially gasified to recycle the water for algae production. This was not successful, but likely would be in case of complete gasification [212]."
