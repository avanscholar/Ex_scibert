0,Introduction,"In recent years, a shortage of global energy resources and the greenhouse effect have been becoming increasingly more serious. Therefore, developing methods to maximize fuel usage is crucial. The development of fuel cells has become an important way to deal with environmental and energy problems. In a fuel cell, hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce power and water and release heat. Fuel cells not only generate few pollutants, but they can also be adopted as independent power supply systems for remote mountaintops or locations with few electrical grids. Because a fuel cell system requires a long-term, stable supply of hydrogen, methods for producing hydrogen through fuel reforming have been extensively studied in recent years. Many studies have explored different fuels and reforming systems intended for use in hydrogen production. In addition, despite the widespread use of fuel reformers, when used in vehicles, portable, high energy density fuels should be primarily considered for reforming. These fuels include liquid alcohols such as methanol or bio-ethanol. Methanol steam reforming has the distinguishing features of a low reforming temperature, high hydrogen purity, a high conversion rate, low CO concentrations in the reformate gas, easy temperature control, and economic operation [1,2]. Notably, methanol is an attractive feedstock for hydrogen generation because it is recognized as playing one of the key roles in the transition to future energy scenarios that must become increasingly independent of fossil fuels. Over the years, methanol steam reforming used for hydrogen production has been extensively studied. For example, many efforts have been made to study the impact of important parameters on the performance of methanol steam reforming, including reformer design (multi-channel, radial and tubular) [3], liquid biofuels [4], catalyst type [5], catalyst layer design and arrangement [6], structural microchannel and manifold parameters [7], and flow and operation parameters [8]. Olah [9] suggested that future development can focus on methanol re-synthesis to form a carbon cycle. This application would be suitable for a portable reformer. Subsequently, a combined reformer fuel cell, known as a reformate methanol fuel cell (RMFC), was established. However, platinum catalysts for both RMFC and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are easily poisoned by carbon monoxide (CO), which affects their power generation performance. Thus, the concentration of CO in the hydrogen-rich gas produced from a fuel reformer is extremely crucial, and integration technologies intended to effectively reduce CO levels in reformate gases and to simultaneously combine fuel cells have become a fundamental research and development necessity. In addition, although there are various fuel reforming methods, in order for the fuel to function in a fuel cell, the amount of CO generated must be reduced to a specific concentration. Numerous researchers have combined steam reforming reactors with combustors to develop micro methanol reformers with the goal of increasing portability and reducing device size. Pan and Wang [10] developed a cross-flow plate-fin reformer (PFR) for methanol steam reforming with integrated fuel and water evaporation, steam reforming, and catalytic combustion. It was found that the heat transfer enhancement of the reformer was carried out through inner plate fins and outer catalytic combustion, thereby providing low CO concentrations and a high methanol conversion rate. Kim [11] integrated a micro methanol reformer with a catalytic combustor for portable fuel cell applications. He found that the conversion rate of methanol was 95.7%, with a hydrogen flow rate of 53.7 ml/min with 1.24% CO, which was adequate to operate a 4.5 W PEMFC. Velasco et al. [12] designed a microchannel reformer/combustor for methanol steam reforming and reported that when the reforming reaction was supported by the combustion reaction and the heat losses due to electric heating, almost isothermal behavior took place in the microchannel reactor. This confirmed good coupling during the methanol steam reforming and methanol combustion. Wang et al. [13] developed a new methanol fuel processing system based on methanol steam reforming and CO selective methanation for in-situ hydrogen production. They found that the methanol fuel processing system could operate continuously for more than 100 h and could directly provide PEMFC with low CO concentrations (<10 ppm) in the reformed hydrogen-rich gas and the ability to generate 100 W of electricity. Dolanc et al. [14] designed a miniature methanol reformer system to feed fuel cells that generated electric power as high as 100 W. The system comprises a complete setup, including catalytic reforming and preferential oxidation (PrOX) reactors, a combustor, evaporators, actuation and sensing elements, and a control unit. Zhang et al. [15] fabricated and tested a reformed methanol fuel cell (RMFC) as a portable power source. Successfully powering a laptop, the RMFC system exhibited stable performance during the complete work flow, including start-up, output, and shutdown. In addition, with a conservative 20 W power rating design, the maximum energy conversion efficiency (36%) of the RMFC system could be achieved, and it showed good stability during long-term operation. Yang et al. [16] designed a fuel processor composed of a methanol oxidative reformer, a methanol combustor, and a two-stage CO preferential oxidation unit. A self-sustained state was achieved with an H2 production rate of 0.99 Nm3 h−1 and an extremely low CO content of less than 25 ppm. However, the reformate gas was not directly supplied to a PEMFC. Pan et al. [17] developed a compact methanol reformer with a plate fin for the purpose of hydrogen production and showed that this reformer provided a high concentration of hydrogen, where the system efficiency was maintained above 74%. Chen et al. [18] developed a methanol processor with a low level of CO content maintained at 4–5 ppm for the online supply of hydrogen to a PEMFC for the purpose of producing a power output of 59 We. Schuller et al. [19] developed a methanol steam reforming reactor operated with a high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell for the purpose of recycling waste heat. The operating temperature of the coupled system was 180 °C, which is significantly lower than the conventional operating temperature in the methanol steam reforming process. Lo and Wong [20] studied the development of a catalytic combustor that could be used with both hydrogen and methanol fuels. The aim was to reutilize the exhaust hydrogen from a fuel cell under stable operation and to burn methanol during the start-up. After the fuel was switched to the H2/CO2 mixture, another 20 min was required to attain an optimal steady state, a high methanol conversion of 95%, and an acceptably low CO fraction of 1.04% at a reaction temperature of 278 °C. When producing hydrogen using steam reforming for fuel cells, essential factors must be considered, including the reaction temperature, the choice of catalysts, and the concentration of CO generated by the reformate gases. Because the CO concentration affects the performance of fuel cells, the PrOX method is typically applied to reduce it. Galletti et al. [21] investigated the purification of hydrogen-rich gas using Ru-based catalysts supported on a γ-Al2O3 washcoat. They found that complete CO removal could be achieved within a suitable temperature range. The best results were obtained with 4% Ru-γ-Al2O3 in the range of 300–340 °C. Li et al. [22] studied CuO–CeO2 catalysts coated with different transition metals (Mn, Fe, Ni, Ti, Co, and Cr). The CuC–Mn catalyst had the widest temperature range (from 110 to 140 °C). The CuC–Fe catalyst had the best activity under a low temperature reaction. Huang et al. [23] investigated the catalyst performance of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3, CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–Pt–Rh, and Pt–Rh in a reformer used for hydrogen generation from a solution of methanol and water. Among the catalysts tested, the CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the best performance at temperatures lower than 320 °C. Yu et al. [24] studied CO and H2 oxidation based on the thermodynamic equilibrium of catalytic oxidations over Au/TiO2 catalysts. The preferential oxidation of an H2-rich gas was investigated. The results showed that adding 1% O2 effectively reduced CO concentrations to less than 100 ppm at temperatures ranging from 0 to 90 °C. Kim et al. [25] prepared various Ru catalysts coated on different supports using a wet impregnation method. They found that the highest CO conversion could be obtained at low temperatures using Ru/YSZ. The high inlet CO concentration could be reduced to less than 10 ppm. Lee et al. [26] designed a propane reforming system that supplied air into the upstream region of a water gas shifting (WGS) reactor. The air feed to preheat the WGS reactor during the start-up period was able to reduce CO levels to less than 50 ppm in the PrOX reactor outlet. Air feeding was shown to cause the reformer to reach steady state within 10 min. Calò et al. [27] used a small reformer for H2 production and found that the methanation process may be more suitable than pressure swinging adsorption for reformate gas purification. Djinovi'c et al. [28] investigated Ru-based powder catalysts supported on CeO2 and γ-Al2O3 by methanation. It was found that a 5% Ru-γ-Al2O3–Cl catalyst gave the best overall performance. Hedström et al. [29] investigated the effects of dilute biogas on reforming efficiency, fuel utilization, dynamics, control strategies, and design criteria for a PEMFC system. Experimental data that could serve as the basis for design of PEMFC biogas systems operating in load-following or steady-state mode were reported for a 5 kW PEMFC stack. Combining a micro reformer with a combustor makes it possible to produce a substantial amount of hydrogen. However, this system functions at a small-scale level, and the heat transfer efficiency of the combustor and reformer must be considered. Therefore, if the reformer employs an autothermal reforming reaction, this not only reduces heat loss, but allows the system to function at a large-scale. Richards and Erickson [30] explored a methanol reforming system using a stratified catalyst bed and reported that the stratified system had fairly high conversions at low O2/CH3OH ratios. Additionally, it showed high selectivity towards hydrogen and low selectivity for carbon monoxide. Yoon et al. [31] used a copper-based catalyst for methanol autothermal reforming and found that the copper-based catalyst had higher selectivity for hydrogen and lower selectivity for carbon monoxide than a noble metal catalyst. Tang et al. [32] developed two fully coupled models to extend the current understanding of reformation processes related to temperature and fuel conversion. Experiments were carried out to obtain the necessary parameters to construct and validate the model. The model can be used to estimate the required reformer length for 100% fuel conversion as well as the effects of flow rate and geometry on conversion efficiency. Xu et al. [33] investigated fuel adaptability in a lab-scale 2.5 kWth autothermal reforming system. The reformer was designed with a mixing chamber and an NiOeRh-based bimetallic catalyst. The adaptability of the reformer to multiple fuels was experimentally studied under different operating conditions. It was concluded that the developed reformer and the associated catalyst have great fuel adaptability and high potential for use in a fuel-flexible autothermal reforming system. Choi et al. [34] investigated autothermal reforming (ATR) of methanol for the purpose of producing hydrogen for transportation applications. An equilibrium model was developed to help design a reforming system intended for future use in ATR research. Chuang et al. [35] designed a fuel reformer consisting of an autothermal reformer followed by an oxygen removal reactor, steam reformer, and water gas shift (WGS) reactor. The effluent from the WGS was fed to a series of three preferential oxidation (PrOX) reactors that reduced the CO concentration to less than 40 ppm. Based on the aforementioned literature, in response to future changes in energy applications, researchers are actively attempting to develop an effective fuel reformer system for fuel cells. Although some progress has been made in the development of micro hydrogen production for small-scale PEMFCs, relatively few researchers have constructed a complete system that includes both a fuel processor system and a fuel cell. Specifically, most studies on methanol reformers and PEMFCs were carried out separately. In particular, in-situ hydrogen production in most studies related to methanol fuel processor/PEMFC integrated systems is only suitable for low-power applications operating at 4.5 W [11], 20 W [15], 59 W [18], 100 W [13,14], and 160 W [36]. One of the novelties of this study lies in the fact that there is still a gap to be filled in the research on an overall integrated system. More importantly, based on the open literature and to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the development of an integrated system that includes a methanol reformer system comprising methanol autothermal reforming (ATR), high temperature WGS, low temperature WGS, and PrOX reactors and a kW-scale PEMFC with air bleeding. It is worth noting that the methanol reformer system proposed in the present work can successfully produce hydrogen-rich gas with low levels of CO for the purpose of real-time use in a kW-scale PEMFC system. Due to their high energy conversion efficiency, high power density, quick start-up, low operating temperature, and environmental friendliness [37], PEMFCs have been used as a power source for transportation, stationary, and portable power applications. However, the operation of PEMFCs requires high purity hydrogen. The common use of compressed hydrogen tanks has problems related to safety and inefficiency, which has led to technical challenges in commercial applications of fuel cells. In order to overcome these problems, there is a need for an effective method by which to develop a fuel processing system that can produce hydrogen in situ through the reforming reaction. However, a reformed gas with high CO concentrations cannot be directly supplied to PEMFC because high CO levels can poison the catalyst in the PEMFC system [38]. Therefore, it is necessary to design a CO removal module in the fuel processing system to produce a reformed gas with a low CO content. In this research, the air bleeding method was applied to the kW-scale PEMFC stack in the reformate PEMFC power generation system to improve the cell performance and the output power stability under CO-containing reformate gases. It is noteworthy that the effectiveness of air bleeding was verified in a real reformate PEMFC system. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, most previous studies on performance recovery and performance stability improvements of PEMFCs involving CO-containing reformate gases with air bleeding were carried out with a single cell (such as [39,40]) or at low power (e.g. Ref. [36]), but not with a kW-scale stack. In addition, in the case of studies on PEMFC stacks with air bleeding methods [41–43], simulated CO-containing reformate gases were used as anodic fuels instead of actual reformate gases from reformers. As a result, another novelty of this study was the verification of the effectiveness of air bleeding in a real reformate kW-scale PEMFC system. There are two ways to produce and utilize hydrogen: One is to feed reformate gas into a fuel cell to generate electricity after a reforming process, and the other is to directly switch it as a fuel in a traditional internal combustion engine. In this study, we focus on the former. The objective was to establish a methanol reforming and purification system to produce hydrogen-rich gas with low CO content in situ that is suitable to power a 1 kW-scale PEMFC system. Therefore, the ATR method was adopted to produce hydrogen-rich gas, and the gas was purified using WGS and PrOX reactors to reduce the CO concentration. An integration test was conducted on the purified hydrogen by feeding the gas into a fuel cell with air bleeding. The reactors used in this study can undergo hydrogen-producing reforming reactions without the use of external heat sources. Consequently, purified hydrogen gas can be stably supplied to a 1 kW PEMFC system."
1,Experimental setup and method,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup A schematic of the integrated system adopted in this experimental study is shown in Fig. 1 . A photograph of the entire methanol reformer system combined with 40-cell fuel cell stacks is shown in Fig. 2 . For the purposes of this study, a methanol reformer system was designed that employed autothermal reforming (ATR), a high-temperature water gas shift reaction (HTWGS), a low-temperature water gas shift reaction (LTWGS), and a preferential oxidation (PrOX) reaction. The autothermal reforming, water gas shifting, and preferential oxidation reactions are shown as follows: Autothermal reforming (ATR): (1) C H 3 O H + α ( O 2 + 3.76 N 2 ) + ( 1 − 2 α ) H 2 O → ( 3 − 2 α ) H 2 + C O 2 + 3.76 α N 2 ( 0 ≤ α ≤ 0.5 ) Water gas shifting reaction (WGS): (2) C O ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) → C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Preferential oxidation reaction (PrOX): (3) C O ( g ) + 1 2 O ( g ) → C O 2 ( g ) ATR was primarily used for hydrogen production through fuel reforming, Eq. (1), where the reactor for this reformer was constructed with stainless steel using machining processes. Subsequently, the hydrogen-rich gas was purified by the water gas shift reactions (HTWGS and LTWGS), Eq. (2), and the PrOX reaction, Eq. (3), to reduce the CO concentration. The HTWGS reactor was made of stainless steel because it has to withstand high reaction temperatures, whereas the remaining reactors (i.e., LTWGS and PrOX) were made of aluminum alloys. Table 1 shows a detailed summary of the system specifications and parameters used in this study. Regarding the experimental catalysts, the Pt/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst was used for the ATR reaction. The HTWGS and LTWGS reactions were catalyzed with their respective Pt/CeO2–ZrO2 and CuO–ZnO catalysts. Finally, a Pt–Ru-based catalyst was utilized for the PrOX reaction to reduce the CO levels. The volume of each reaction catalyst was based on the inlet volume flow rate and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). First, the fuel reforming for hydrogen production was conducted with an optimal O2/CH3OH ratio of 0.55 by feeding the prepared water-methanol solution (H2O/CH3OH = 0.5) into the ATR reactor through the liquid feeding system. Second, appropriate amounts of water and CO (H2O/CO = 5.6) were supplied to the HTWGS and LTWGS reactors. Finally, the gas fed into the PrOX reactor reacted with an optimal O2/CO ratio of 1.08 to reduce the CO concentration to a range that met the requirements of the fuel cell system. The operating temperatures of ATR, HTWGS, LTWGS, and PrOX were 565 (T3), 404 (T4), 306 (T8), and 192 °C (T14), respectively. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, in the methanol reformer system, two sets of solenoid valves were adopted (S.V.1 and S.V.2). When the ATR reactor was in a steady state or started in a cold state, the valves controlled the methanol flow rate of the reactor by decreasing the cold start up time. A K-type thermocouple device was used to measure the temperatures of the inlets/outlets and the catalysts of the reforming reactors (T1-T16 in Fig. 1), and the DAQ card was used to acquire the temperatures of each reactor. A condenser was employed to extract water from the product gas, which subsequently underwent a dry base analysis. The gas measurement analysis system included gas chromatography (Agilent 6850 GC) and a multi-component gas analyzer (Rosemount, Model NGA-2000). In this study, PEMFC stacks of 40 cells were employed, with specifications as shown in Table 2 . Pt–Ru and Pt catalysts were used for the anode and cathode of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), respectively. The PEMFC stack in this research had a single active area of 112.85 cm2. The oxidant for the cathode was air. The anodic catalyst loading and cathodic catalyst loading on the MEA were 0.45 mg/cm2 and 0.4 mg/cm2, respectively. The flow field was a three-channel serpentine design. The depth and width of the flow channel were 0.8 mm and 2 mm, respectively. This stack was air cooled, and the depth and width of a cooling channel were 1.2 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The fuel cell system was first activated using pure hydrogen before an integration test was conducted."
3,Experimental method,"2.2 Experimental method Various reforming methods influence the product gas composition and the amount of heat released during oxidation in a reformer. In this study, hydrogen was produced from methanol through the ATR reaction and was subsequently purified to reduce the CO concentration. During the testing process, the ATR reaction was tested with varying H2O/CH3OH and O2/CH3OH ratios to investigate the fuel reforming characteristics. The space velocity and the H2O/CO ratio were used to examine the WGS reactions. The space velocity and O2/CO ratio were used to determine the CO conversion efficiency of the PrOX reaction. The temperatures of the WGS and PrOX reactions must be strictly controlled to reduce the CO concentration. Specifically, if the temperature of the PrOX reaction is too high, it will cause hydrogen consumption, thereby significantly increasing the CO concentration. After preliminary testing, the parameters of each reactor were adjusted to operating conditions that reduced hydrogen consumption and achieved an allowable CO concentration. Next, the reformer system was tested for its stability. Finally, the performance of the reformer system integrated with 40-cell fuel cell stacks was examined. The CO in the hydrogen-rich gas affected the efficiency of the fuel cell. Therefore, during the fuel cell integration test, air was fed from the anode electrode of the MEA, a process known as air bleeding, to reduce the CO concentration. In addition, the effects of air bleeding on the current, voltage, and power output of the fuel cell stack were investigated. During the experimental test, a multi-component gas analyzer (Rosemount NGA-2000) was used to continuously monitor the real-time product gas to determine the changes in CO concentrations and ultimately prevent fuel cell damage. Before the gas sample entered the gas analyzer, it was cooled, dried, and filtered through a gas sample conditioning procedure. Then, the gas analyzer was used to measure specific gases. The analyzer was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector for the purpose of analyzing H2 concentrations and with infrared adsorption detectors for the purpose of measuring the CO, CO2, and CH4 concentrations. Relative to the full scale, the measurement error was ±1%. Additionally, a GC analysis was performed by collecting product gases into sampling bags at intervals of 30 min."
4,Relevant calculations,"2.3 Relevant calculations The relevant equations used for the calculations are shown below. The molar ratios of oxygen to methanol, water to methanol, water to carbon monoxide, and oxygen to carbon monoxide were calculated using Eqs. (4)–(7), respectively. The CO conversion efficiency was calculated using Eq. (8). O2/CH3OH (oxygen/methanol molar ratio): (4) O 2 / C H 3 O H = n ˙ O 2 n ˙ C H 3 O H = ρ o 2 × V ˙ O 2 M O 2 ρ C H 3 O H × V ˙ C H 3 O H M C H 3 O H H2O/CH3OH (water/methanol molar ratio): (5) H 2 O / C H 3 O H = n ˙ H 2 O n ˙ C H 3 O H = ρ H 2 O × V ˙ H 2 O M H 2 O ρ C H 3 O H × V ˙ C H 3 O H M C H 3 O H H2O/CO (water/carbon monoxide molar ratio): (6) H 2 O / C O = n ˙ H 2 O n ˙ C O = ρ H 2 O × V ˙ H 2 O M H 2 O ρ C O × V ˙ C O M C O O2/CO (oxygen/carbon monoxide molar ratio): (7) O 2 / C O = n ˙ O 2 n ˙ C O = ρ O 2 × V ˙ O 2 M O 2 ρ C O × V ˙ C O M C O CO conversion efficiency: (8) C O c o n v e r s i o n e f f i c i e n c y ( % ) = n ˙ C O i n − n ˙ C O o u t n ˙ C O i n , where n ˙ O 2 , n ˙ C H 3 O H , n ˙ H 2 O , and n ˙ C O represent the molar flow rates of O2, CH3OH, H2O, and CO, respectively; ρ O 2 , ρ C H 3 O H , ρ H 2 O , and ρ C O are the densities of O2, CH3OH, H2O, and CO, respectively; V ˙ O 2 , V ˙ C H 3 O H , V ˙ H 2 O , and V ˙ C O are the volume flow rates of O2, CH3OH, H2O, and CO, respectively; M O 2 , M C H 3 O H , M H 2 O , and M C O are the molecular weights of O2, CH3OH, H2O, and CO, respectively; n ˙ C O i n denotes the number of moles of carbon monoxide input, and n ˙ C O o u t designates the number of moles of carbon monoxide output."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogen production by autothermal reforming,"3.1 Hydrogen production by autothermal reforming The reformer designed in this study was adopted to carry out methanol reforming. In this system, an autothermal reforming (ATR) reaction was employed to generate heat energy for hydrogen production. During the reaction, because the gas composition of the product influenced the CO processing (i.e., the WGS and PrOX reactions), the O2/CH3OH and H2O/CH3OH ratios for the ATR reaction were adjusted to produce hydrogen-rich gas with low CO concentrations. Subsequently, the CO and water underwent WGS reactions to decrease the CO concentration and increase the hydrogen concentration. Therefore, the performance of the ATR reformer was based on the concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Summarizing the above, the hydrogen and CO concentrations were increased by enhancing the methanol conversion. These gases subsequently underwent WGS and PrOX reactions to reduce the CO concentration, thus maximizing the hydrogen production. The methanol conversion efficiency ranged from 59.92 to 100% (Table 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3 , the reaction temperature was in the range of about 200–650 °C, which greatly depended on the O2/CH3OH and H2O/CH3OH ratios. For a given H2O/CH3OH ratio, the catalyst bed temperature (T3) increased with the O2/CH3OH ratio. However, the catalyst bed temperature decreased with increases in the H2O/CH3OH ratio for a fixed O2/CH3OH. Consequently, as depicted in Table 3, for a fixed H2O/CH3OH ratio, the methanol conversion efficiency increased with the O2/CH3OH ratio due to the enhanced exothermic reaction of methanol ATR. It was noted that 100% CH3OH conversion was achieved at the O2/CH3OH ratio of 0.65 for all H2O/CH3OH ratios (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). For the O2/CH3OH ratio between 0.35 and 0.55, the CH3OH conversion efficiency decreased with increases in the H2O/CH3OH ratio. This phenomenon was caused by the relatively lower methanol supply (resulting in a decrease in the heat released from the ATR) and a greater steam supply (leading to the dilution or attenuation effect [11]) for the methanol oxidation reaction. Based on the ATR reformer test results (Fig. 3) with various H2O/CH3OH ratios, at the conditions of H2O/CH3OH ratios of 0.25 and 0.5, the highest H2 + CO concentrations were obtained at O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.45. When the H2O/CH3OH ratio was relatively higher (0.75), the highest H2 + CO concentrations occurred at O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.55. However, a satisfactory result was not achieved when the reactor temperature was low because there was insufficient heat to drive the WGS reaction. Furthermore, as can be seen, a relatively higher H2O/CH3OH ratio made it difficult to ignite the water-methanol solution. This affected the cold start time, resulting in poor reforming results. Overall, the highest H2 + CO concentrations occurred at the operating conditions of an H2O/CH3OH ratio = 0.25 and an O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.45. As shown in Table 3, when the oxygen supplied for the chemical reaction was relatively insufficient, for example, an O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.35, the increase in the H2O/CH3OH ratio caused both the H2 yield and the CO yield to decrease. On the other hand, when the O2/CH3OH ratio was relatively higher, such as 0.45 and 0.55, the condition under which the H2O/CH3OH ratio = 0.5 resulted in better H2 and CO yields. At an O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.65, better H2 yield (72.25%) and CO yield (51.80%) occurred at H2O/CH3OH = 0.5 and 0.25, respectively. Based on the results tabulated in Table 3, when the feed parameters were under conditions at which the H2O/CH3OH ratio = 0.5 and the O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.55, the best yields of H2 and CO were 84.76% and 61.24%, respectively. These values were therefore adopted as the feed parameter settings for the subsequent experiments. Fig. 4 shows the effects of various O2/CH3OH ratios on the ATR product gas concentrations. According to Eq. (1), methanol ATR produces CO2. As shown in Table 3, the methanol conversion increased with the O2/CH3OH ratio. As a result, Fig. 4 indicates that the higher the methanol conversion, the higher the CO2 concentration. It was also found from Fig. 4 that the increase in the O2/CH3OH ratio (ranging from 0.35 to 0.55) significantly increased the CO concentration. This is because the higher reaction temperature caused by the increased O2/CH3OH ratio facilitated the reverse water gas shift reaction and methanol decomposition to produce CO. In the case of a given H2O/CH3OH ratio of 0.50, when the O2/CH3OH ratio was between 0.45 and 0.55, through the ATR reaction, the highest concentrations of H2 and CO reached 33% and 10%, respectively. Therefore, the concentration of CO in the product gas must be initially reduced using WGS reactions before entering the PrOX reactor. If a gas with a high CO concentration is fed into the PrOX reactor, heat is released from the CO oxidation, causing the reaction temperature to increase dramatically. As a result, not only is it impossible to effectively remove CO, but hydrogen is also oxidized, thereby reducing the hydrogen concentration."
7,Reformate gas purification system (WGS and PrOX reactors),"3.2 Reformate gas purification system (WGS and PrOX reactors) In this study, a preliminary test was conducted on the reforming purification system to determine the characteristics of the HTWGS and LTWGS reaction catalysts. This was carried out by feeding different percentages of simulated CO gas into the WGS reactors under various H2O/CO ratios and catalyst bed temperatures. According to the results shown in Table 4 , when the catalyst in HTWGS was at temperatures from 300 to 400 °C, better CO conversion efficiency was obtained. When the catalyst in the LTWGS was in a temperature range of 200–300 °C, better CO conversion efficiency was also found. At a given H2O/CO ratio and a fixed CO concentration in the mixture of CO and N2, the CO conversion efficiency of the HTWGS reaction increased with increases in the temperature, and after reaching the maximum conversion efficiency at 400 °C, it decreased at 500 °C. In addition, a specific H2O/CO ratio must be used for the WGS reactions to achieve an effective CO conversion. Meanwhile, the LTWGS reaction obtained the best reaction temperature of approximately 300 °C (Table 5 ). Following the preliminary test, the operating parameters determined as optimal for the HTWGS and LTWGS reactions were combined with the ATR reaction parameters to comprehensively examine the reforming and purification system. After the ATR reformer test, the most appropriate parameters (ATR: H2O/CH3OH ratio = 0.5 and O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.55) were applied to perform fuel reforming intended to produce hydrogen. Then, the reformate gas was fed into the WGS reactors while controlling the amount of feed water (WGS: H2O/CO = 5.6). The temperature in the WGS reactors was maintained at approximately 400 °C. The concentrations of the HTWGS and LTWGS reaction products are shown in Fig. 5 . Initially, the ATR reaction generated 10% CO and 33% hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 5, following the HTWGS reaction, the CO concentration was significantly reduced to 2.23%, and the hydrogen was increased to 34.20%. In order to further reduce the CO concentration and improve the PrOX reaction, the HTWGS reaction products were fed into the LTWGS reactor, in which the CO concentration was reduced to 0.78%, while the H2 concentration was increased. This step was advantageous for the subsequent CO elimination stage in the PrOX reaction. Following the WGS reaction, the reformate gas composition contained approximately 0.78% CO, which would poison the platinum catalyst if directly fed into a fuel cell. Therefore, the PrOX reactor was developed to further reduce the CO concentration in the reformate gas. The GHSV of the PrOX reaction was set at 6450 h−1. Also, the O2/CO ratio employed for the PrOX reaction is extremely crucial. Fig. 6 shows the effects of the catalyst bed temperature (T14 in Fig. 1) and the O2/CO ratio on the PrOX reaction. It was found that the reaction temperature increased with the O2/CO ratio. In addition, the CO concentration initially decreased, subsequently followed by a slightly increasing trend after 250 °C. This was because the addition of O2 initially led to oxidation of the CO to form CO2. However, an excessive amount of O2 significantly enhanced oxidation, leading to an increase in temperature, in turn causing side reactions such as methanation. As can be seen, after the temperature reached 200 °C, the hydrogen concentration decreased, while the CH4 concentration increased. The effects of the O2/CO ratios on the CO conversion efficiency and catalyst bed temperature at GHSV 6450 h−1 are shown in Fig. 7 . These effects also indicated that the reaction temperature increased with the O2/CO ratio. The CO conversion efficiency was found to be increased with increases in the O2/CO ratio from 0 to 1.08. However, when an excessive amount of O2 was supplied, such as an O2/CO ratio = 1.44, the CO conversion efficiency was slightly decreased. It should be noted that when the O2/CO ratio reached 1.08, the CO conversion efficiency approached approximately 100%, indicating a significant reduction in CO."
8,An integrated durability test for the reformer system,"3.3 An integrated durability test for the reformer system The focus when developing a reformer system should be on the ability to stably maintain the production of low-CO hydrogen-rich gas to prevent poisoning of fuel cell electrode catalysts. Therefore, with the parameter settings tabulated in Table 1, a durability test was conducted on the reformer system. As shown in Fig. 8 , the catalyst temperature dramatically increased with the addition of fuel into the reformer system. This increase resulted from the autothermal reforming reaction, which supplied the thermal energy for the system. Subsequently, the hydrogen-rich gas entered the WGS reactors, where the HTWGS reactor temperature (T4) was maintained at 400 °C. Afterwards, the temperature decreased progressively as the gas went downstream in the LTWGS reactor. That is, T8 = 306 °C, T9 = 258 °C, and T10 = 210 °C. In other words, the operating temperature range of the LTWGS was approximately 200–300 °C, which is comparable to the study by Houston et al. [44]. In Table 1, the operating temperature in the LTWGS reactor represents the temperature at the inlet of the LTWGS (T8), which is 306 °C. This value also coincides with the result shown in Table 5, where for the LTWGS reaction, the best reaction temperature was approximately 300 °C. When entering the PrOX reaction, the reaction temperature (T11) was approximately 150 °C. At the LTWGS outlet, the hydrogen concentration was the highest, approximately 33%. After the PrOX reaction was completed, the hydrogen concentration decreased to 29.5%, and the CO concentration dropped to 20 ppm. An approximately 4 h durability test was performed on the reformer system. The product gas was sampled every 30 min for the purpose of the analysis, and the catalyst temperature for each stage of the reformer system was recorded. The results showed that the temperature of each reactor increased and gradually stabilized following system activation (Fig. 9 A and B). Specifically, the temperature fluctuated slightly during the first hour. However, the entire reformer system was maintained at a nearly constant temperature. The results of the product gas analysis indicated that the CH4 increased slightly for the first 2 h, but decreased momentarily before stabilizing. As shown in Fig. 9A, during the 4 h of testing, the reformate gas with a low CO concentration was maintained at approximately 20 ppm, which is not high. Then, this hydrogen-rich gas was fed into the PEMFC and was able to drive the kW-scale fuel cell system."
9,Durability test for the integrated reformer system and the PEMFC stacks,"3.4 Durability test for the integrated reformer system and the PEMFC stacks Following a series of stability tests, the reformer system was tested with a set of 40-cell PEMFC stacks. The reformer system was activated, and after it reached a steady state, the purified hydrogen-rich gas was fed into the fuel cell stack system. The gas at the fuel cell outlet was then measured, and the fuel cell was loaded at a current of 40 A. The results of this test are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 . The voltage was 30 V before loading, which was decreased to 26 V after loading. The power output was maintained at 1040 W. The hydrogen concentration decreased to approximately 10% after the reaction in the fuel cell. Although the CO in the product reformate gas was reduced to 20 ppm, this may have caused CO poisoning in the fuel cells. To prevent this, air at a suitable flow rate was fed into the reformer system 4 h prior to the test to activate CO oxidation, thereby protecting the MEA and reducing fuel cell damage. After 4 h, the air bleeding was turned off, and a test was conducted to determine whether a CO concentration exceeding 10 ppm had caused decreased fuel cell performance. The test results showed that the CO concentration at the system outlet had slightly increased (Fig. 11). On the other hand, the output voltage and power of the fuel cell had slightly decreased (Fig. 10); however, the effect was not significant. Overall, following 6 h of durability testing on the combined reformer and fuel cell stack system, it was found that the PEMFC stack was able to steadily supply 1 kW of power. CO is an undesirable product of methanol steam reforming because it can poison the Pt-based catalyst in a PEMFC. A typical PEMFC can only tolerate 10 ppm CO. When using a Pt–Ru catalyst, this value may increase to 50 ppm or more. In this study, the hydrogen-rich gas (the actual reformate gas) produced by the reformer was used, which has better performance than the simulated reformate gas [43]. The main difference between this study and Chen et al.‘s research [43] is that the actual reformate gases with concentrations of approximately 20 ppm CO were used in this study, but in Chen et al.‘s study, simulated reformate gases with up to 50 ppm CO were utilized. Additionally, the actual reformate gases entered the PEMFC at a temperature of approximately 80 °C (T18 in Fig. 1) in the present study, but the simulated reformate gases entered the PEMFC at a temperature of approximately 60 °C [43]. A moderately high temperature can mitigate the effect of CO poisoning on a fuel cell. A higher cell temperature can improve CO tolerance due to the strong temperature dependence of the adsorption equilibrium constant of CO on Pt [45–47]. Therefore, in this study, the integrated system was shown to effectively maintain at a steady state for 6 h, and its performance was better than when using simulated reformate gases [43]."
10,Energy conversion efficiency,"3.5 Energy conversion efficiency Fig. 12 shows the efficiency cascade of the integrated system, starting with methanol and ending with the net power output of the PEMFC. The value on the right represents the efficiency of each sub-process, and the one on the left shows the cumulative efficiency. The efficiency of each sub-process from ATR to PrOX is defined as: (9) η A T R = o u t p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r A T R i n p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y ( M e O H ) , (10) η H T W G S = o u t p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r H T W G S i n p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r A T R , (11) η L T W G S = o u t p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r L T W G S i n p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r H T W G S , (12) η P r O X = o u t p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r P r O X i n p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r L T W G S , In addition, ηPEMFC is the output electrical energy of the PEMFC stack divided by the chemical energy of the input reformate gas, as shown in Eq. (13): (13) η P E M F C = o u t p u t e l e c t i c a l e n e r g y i n p u t c h e m i c a l e n e r g y o f t h e r e f o r m a t e g a s a f t e r P r O X , As can be seen, for the overall reforming (ATR) and purification (HTWGS, LTWGS and PrOX) process reactions, the cumulative efficiency was 53.5%, indicating that 46.5% of the methanol energy was lost in the form of heat. Additionally, compared with the full utilization of pure hydrogen, fuel cell technologies cannot fully utilize the hydrogen from the reformer. Accordingly, only about 35% of the hydrogen supplied to the PEMFC can be converted into electricity."
11,Conclusions,"Based on the experimental results, the reformer system produced hydrogen through fuel reforming with the adoption of an adequate H2O/CH3OH ratio. This system employed an ATR reformer, which supplied thermal energy for the system using an autothermal reforming reaction. Therefore, an external heat source was not required. Furthermore, the heat generated by the ATR reactor maintained the product gas at a high temperature, providing sufficient heat for the subsequent WGS reactions. Accompanied by the HTWGS and LTWGS reactors, the system reduced the CO levels in the reformate gas, enhancing the subsequent PrOX reaction. Furthermore, an appropriate O2/CO ratio for the PrOX reaction was used to comply with the requirements of the fuel cell system. If this ratio is too high, the catalyst temperature increases, causing methanation side reactions and increasing the CH4 level. Consequently, the hydrogen is reduced, and the CO concentration is increased. A 29.5% hydrogen-rich gas with a CO concentration of approximately 20 ppm was achieved when the reformer and purification system were adjusted to the optimal parameter settings (i.e., an H2O/CH3OH ratio = 0.5 and an O2/CH3OH ratio = 0.55 for the ATR reaction, an H2O/CO ratio = 5.6 for the WGS reaction, and an O2/CO ratio = 1.08 for the PrOX reaction). Furthermore, the reformer system was confirmed to steadily produce low CO, hydrogen-rich gas after 4 h of durability testing. This system was then combined with 40-cell fuel cell stacks and tested for its durability over a period of 6 h. Meanwhile, in order to prevent CO poisoning in the fuel cells, an air bleeding method was adopted to improve the cell performance and the output power stability under CO-containing reformate gases. Importantly, there have been no studies using the present integrated system to explore the effectiveness of air bleeding on the current, voltage, and power output in a real kW-scale reformate PEMFC system. It was verified that the reformer and purification system steadily produced real-time hydrogen-rich gas that enabled the fuel cell with air bleeding to continuously generate a stable output power of 1040 W. It should be noted that in this study, the hydrogen-rich gas (the actual reformate gas) produced by the reformer was used, and its performance was better than that of simulated reformed gas [43]."
