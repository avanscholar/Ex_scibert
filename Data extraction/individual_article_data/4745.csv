0,Introduction,"Organic wastes are converted into methane in the conventional anaerobic treatment of wastewater/biomass [1]. The process can be divided into two distinct stages: acidification and methane production. Each stage is carried out by a number of microorganisms through syntrophic interaction. Acidification produces H 2 as a by-product, which in turn is used as an electron donor by many methanogens at the second stage of the process. Glucose or other carbohydrates are the preferred carbon source for the H 2 fermentation [2,3], which give rise to acetic and butyric acids together with H 2 gas: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 , (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 . The effluent from fermentative H 2 generation, rich in organic acids, could be further exploited by methanogenesis. From the ratios of acetic and butyric acids often formed, a H 2 yield of approximately 2.5 mol H 2 / mol hexose degraded can be expected, or approximately 0.3 m 3 / kg carbohydrate utilized, with about 60% in the off-gas. However, it is difficult to establish a high H 2 yield because the amount of fermentation products is significantly influenced directly/indirectly by various factors such as stirring [4] and pH level [5,6]. H 2 partial pressure in the liquid phase is one of the key factors affecting H 2 production [7]. The effects of poor mass transfer and H 2 inhibition can be crucial for solid wastes converting into H 2 in bioreactors. Many controversial observations regarding the influence of H 2 gas on the anaerobic breakdown of saccharides have been reported [8]. Tanisho et al. [9] by sparging with argon obtained an increase in residual NADH, which might be expected to give increased H 2 , although the H 2 production was not actually measured. Mizuno et al. [13] also used nitrogen gas sparging to enhance H 2 production from glucose. These authors found the same effect on NADH when sparging with H 2 , and attributed this to CO 2 removal. Therefore, decreasing the dissolved H 2 concentration by enhancing the H 2 mass transfer from liquid to gas phase should facilitate H 2 production, as well as solid waste decomposition in the reactor. Batch experiments have been conducted to produce H 2 from solid wastes [3,10] and cellulose wastewater [5,11], and continuous experiments are conducted with glucose [12,13], starch [7] and sugary wastewater [14]. Results so far indicated that the control of pH is crucial to H 2 production, due to the effects of pH on the hydrogenase activity [15] and/or metabolism pathways [5]. The reported optimal pH values for H 2 production are conflicting, varying from pH 9.0 for batch fermentation of sucrose to pH 4.0–4.5 and pH 4.7–5.7, respectively, for the continuous fermentation of sucrose and of starch [1,5,6,16]. As far as it is known at present, no attempt has been made to systematically study the influences of stirring and pH on high-solid organic wastes converting into H 2 . Additionally, satisfactory stability and specific yields have not been obtained in continuous flow studies with mixed culture due to inhibition by microbial competition. Especially, the design of a continuous H 2 producing process has often lacked background information from pilot studies. To remedy the latter, the following experiments were performed in a 10-L fermenter to produce H 2 using 3wt% spent brewery grains. H 2 production lag, rate, and yield at various levels of stirring and pH were evaluated. Subsequently, experiments were also performed according to a predictive polynomial quadratic equation incorporating multivariate analysis to optimize stirring and pH on the Clostridium-rich composts converting the wheat dregs into H 2 . Finally, the confirmatory experiments were performed with a 100-L pilot reactor in sequencing batch mode."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reactor set-up,"2.1 Reactor set-up Two fermenters with working volume of 10-L (id.: 20cm; long: 40cm) and 100-L (id.: 50cm; long: 90cm) were utilized, the former as a batch bioreactor for finding an optimal stirring speed and pH for H 2 production. The latter was a continuous flow bioreactor for confirming the results of 10-L experiments. The 100-L reactor was operated at a quasi hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days. Both reactors were run at the mesophilic temperature of 40 ∘ C . Stirring was achieved by mechanical mixer (10–200rpm). 2.1.1 Seed materials and start-up Previous observations [2,6] confirmed that the heat-shocked composts possess highly active clostridial H 2 -producing characteristics and a 3-h, 85 ∘ C pretreatment could produce high activity H 2 -producing microorganisms. In order to have homogeneous Clostridium-rich seed material, the supernatant liquid of grass composting mixture was obtained. This mixture was a 3-h, 85 ∘ C , heat-shocked grass-composting sample mixed completely with deionized water. The reactors were fed with spent grains and maintained at a constant solid concentration of 3.0wt%. Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids contained in the grains were 68.4%, 14.3%, and 2.8%, respectively. Each liter of media in the reactors was supplemented with 80g of NH 4 CO 3 , 40g of KH 2 PO 4 , 4.0g of MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , 0.4g of NaCl, 0.4g of MnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O , and 0.11g of FeCl 2 , which was modified slightly from [17]. The initial pH was adjusted to 6.5 by adding KOH. The reactors in the start-up period were operated in batch mode (without feeding and decanting). The amount of biogas produced was recorded daily using a wet-gas meter. A biogas sampling port was installed on the top of reactor to allow direct biogas sampling with a syringe. 2.1.2 Reactors operation After successful start-up, the 10-L bioreactor was operated under a batch mode, and pH was controlled by a pH controller following experimental design (Fig. 1 ). The 100-L bioreactor was fed individually with dry grains and nutrients. This reactor was tapped and charged six times per HRT at equal interval. It took about 10min for decanting and 20min for feeding. 2.1.3 Experimental design In order to find the optimal stirring speed and pH in the anaerobic chemostat reactor, 24 experimental runs were performed with the 10-L bioreactor (design as Fig. 1) and 2 runs of confirmation with 100-L pilot reactor (40 and 100rpm). In Fig. 1, Reynolds numbers (Re) were calculated through the following equation: (3) Re = ρ · V · D μ , where ρ is liquid density, kg / m 3 , V is liquid flow rate, m/s, D is reactor's diameter, m, μ is liquid viscosity, Pas. Thus, the Reynolds number of liquid in the 10-L reactor under various stirring speeds is listed in Table 1 . To avoid reliance on extensive external data to generate a reference distribution, a completely randomized design was adopted to manage all experiments. In each run, the reactor was seeded with fresh seed materials and data collected daily including H 2 , fatty acids, and alcohols. In addition, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solid (TS) of the reactor were determined in the initial and final stages."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The percentage of H 2 in biogas was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2-m stainless column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were 100, 70, and 100 ∘ C , respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min. The methane and carbon dioxide were determined using a second GC-TCD of the same model also with a 2m stainless column packed with Porapak T (50/80 mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven, and the detector were the same with those of the H 2 analysis. The detection limit of the TCD was 0.1% for methane. The concentrations of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) were established using a third GC of the same model with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 2-m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60 mesh). The operational temperatures for the injection port, the oven, and the FID were 170, 145, and 170 ∘ C , respectively. The alcohols, including ethanol, propanol and butanol, were assayed using a GC-FID of the same model with a 2-m glass column packed with Gaskuropack 54 (60/80 mesh). The operational temperatures for the injection port, the oven, and the FID were 200, 185, and 200 ∘ C , respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas for the determinations of methane, VFAs and alcohols at a flow rate of 30mL/min. The volatile suspended solid (VSS), which represented the biomass concentration, and the COD were measured according to Standard Methods (1998). 2.2.1 Data analysis Two equations were used, one to describe the H 2 production, the other to evaluate the optimization of stirring speed and pH. The details are outlined as follows: (1) The 10-L reactor was operated under a batch mode. Thus, H 2 production curves were obtained for each experimental run. Each curve was modeled to the data using the modified Gompertz equation. (4) H ( t ) = P exp - exp R m · e P λ - t + 1 . Fig. 2 shows a cumulative H 2 production curve best fitted by minimizing the ratio of the sum of square error to the correlation coefficient using “Solver” function in the “Tools” menu in Microsoft Excel 2000. The curve was initially fit visually and was subjected to the constraints of H 2 producing potential, P (mL), the H 2 production rate, R m ( mL H 2 / day ) , and the lag phase, λ (h). The rate values are normalized and expressed as R m / seeding material (Rs, mL H 2 / gTVS / day )”. In addition, Ps, the specific H 2 yield, was determined in this study. Ps is defined as P/substrate ( mL H 2 / gTVS ) . (2) The effects of stirring speed and pH on the Ps and Rs were analyzed as (5) Y i = β o + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 + β 3 x 3 + β 11 x 1 2 + β 22 x 2 2 + β 33 x 3 2 + β 12 x 1 x 2 + β 13 x 1 x 3 + β 23 x 2 x 3 , where Y i is predicted response (i.e., Rs and Ps); x 1 and x 2 are variables (i.e., stirring speed and pH); β o is the offset term; β 1 , β 2 , and β 3 are linear coefficients; β 11 , β 22 , and β 33 are the squared coefficients; β 12 , β 13 , and β 23 are the interaction coefficients. Multiple regression for Eq. (5) was performed using the function “LINEST” in Microsoft Excel 2000. The statistical diagnosis of above parameters was based on the approaches reported by Lay et al. [10], the following were used to evaluate a fit: correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) , standard errors (SE), 95% confidence limits, and t-values of the parameters (ratio of parameter value to SE)."
4,Results and discussions,"Twenty-four experimental 10-L reactor runs with various stirring speeds and pH were conducted to investigate their influence on H 2 production. The H 2 content, COD, and TS removal are listed in Table 2 and described in detail as follows."
5,Effects of stirring speed and pH on H 2 production and COD reduction,"3.1 Effects of stirring speed and pH on H 2 production and COD reduction Fig. 3 illustrates the cumulative H 2 production obtained from 10-L reactor with 3% spent brewery grains under various pH and stirring speed (refers to Fig. 1). In Fig. 3, H 2 production started clearly depending on pH values. The lag of H 2 production decreased from 18 to 9h and increased to 12h, while the pH increased from 5.0 to 6.0 and from 6.0 to 6.5, respectively. The lag was not significantly different with different stirring speeds. However, the H 2 production potential at pH 6.0 decreased from approximately 6.1 to 1.8L as the stirring speed was decreased from 100 to 20rpm, while their H 2 content of biogas was around 40–50% (Table 2). On the other hand, high COD reduction of 37.1% was obtained at the high H 2 production conditions of pH 6.0 and stirring speed of 100rpm as shown in Fig. 4 . Considering the above findings one could conclude that stirring speed significantly affected COD reduction as well as H 2 production when the reactor was at an optimal pH condition of around 5.5–6.0. This value was similar to that favoring glucose, sucrose and cellulose anaerobically converting to H 2 [3,5,7,13]."
6,Effects of stirring speed and pH on acid and alcohol production,"3.2 Effects of stirring speed and pH on acid and alcohol production Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate both VFA and alcohol increase and then decrease while the stirring speed of 10-L reactor increased from 20 to 100rpm and from 100 to 150rpm, respectively. It was apparent that the stirring speed of 100rpm was a threshold for the H 2 -producing microorganisms generating VFA and alcohol. However, a high VFA would result in a low alcohol level under different pH levels considering Figs. 5 and 6 globally. These phenomena were in agreement with Lay et al's study [2]. A heat-shocked sludge can convert carbohydrate-rich organic wastes to H 2 , which parallels Clostridium sp. fermenting carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose and soluble cellulose. The sludge was able to induce a metabolic shift from H 2 / VFA to alcohols. However, the H 2 development (refer to Fig. 3) did not quite match these trends. The RT-PCR and PCR analysis results also indicate that copious H 2 was generated from Clostridium thermocellum and Klebsiella pneunmonia when the reactor was maintained at a mesophilic condition of 40 ∘ C [18]. These results imply that despite the presence of clostridia bacteria, the other bacteria still predominate in the reactor to convert the waste to H 2 ."
7,Kinetic analysis of H 2 production under various stirring speeds and pH,"3.3 Kinetic analysis of H 2 production under various stirring speeds and pH The H 2 production of the microorganisms consuming spent grains typically displayed a lag period (refer to Fig. 2). During this period, the bacterial cells modified their physiological state to take advantage of their environment and began multiplying, and the spore suspensions developed into vegetative cells. The biosystem created with these cells initially transform substance into H 2 with an exponential phase ( R ) and a final saturation phase ( P ) obtained throughout the whole culture history. Dividing the R and the P by the amount of the seed material and the grains, respectively correspond to H 2 production activity (Rs) and the yield of H 2 . Eq. (4) was then used to fit the experimental data of each cumulative H 2 production. Table 4 summarizes the design matrix of the variables in natural units along with the best values of the parameters. In Table 4, the calculated values of R 2 for determining the correlation between observations and estimations were from 0.997 to 0.999. This indicates that parameters of Eq. (4) are significantly involved in the H 2 production variance with various stirring speeds and pHs. Detailed descriptions follow. 3.3.1 H 2 production lag Fig. 7 A illustrates that the lag period decreased from 20 to around 7h and increased to around 10h while the pH level increased from 5.0 to 6.0 and from 6.0 to 6.5, respectively. It is obvious that pH influenced the H 2 production lag more significantly than the stirring speed. A minimum lag was found at pH of 6.0. This result was different from that for general bacterial cell growth lag. The H 2 -producing lag in this study represented the germination period of the spore forming microorganisms generating H 2 [6] because the reactor was seeded with fresh heat-shock seeding liquid in each individual run. The H 2 production lag correlated with the germination of spore-forming microorganisms and was affected by pH condition. The substrate diffusion therefore becomes less important than pH during this period. 3.3.2 Specific H 2 production rate Fig. 7B shows the trends of specific H 2 production rate (Rs) under various pH's and stirring speeds. Comparing individual curve in Fig. 7B reflects that a high Rs has occurred at a pH of approximately 6.0. These Rs increased and decreased while the stirring speed increased from 20 to 100rpm and from 100 to 150rpm, respectively. This result implies that pH and stirring speed simultaneously influenced on Rs. The results of the stirring speed increasing from 20 to 100rpm were expected because the stirring speed corresponds to the rate of diffusion of a substrate across a biolayer based on Fick's first law [19]. Moreover, H 2 partial pressure in the liquid phase is one of the key factors affecting H 2 production. Mizuno et al.'s study [3] also indicate that nitrogen sparging could enhance a continuous stirred-tank reactor's performance converting glucose to H 2 at a pH of 6.0. However, Rs decreased significantly when the stirring speed was greater than 100rpm (Fig. 7B) in this study. Here it should be noted that total acids and alcohols decreased from 2.7 to 1.9g/L and maintained at approximately 1.0g/L, respectively, while the pH was 6.0 (refer to Figs. 5 and 6; Table 3 ). A previous study [5] indicated that influence of pH and HRT in starch fermentation corresponded to metabolic control because anaerobic H 2 -producing microorganisms (e.g., Clostridium sp.) shift their metabolism from H 2 - and acid-producing phase to alcohol-producing phase [20]. That is, the effect of metabolism was more important than that of substrate diffusion in this study. On the other hand, the stirring speed increased from 20 to 100rpm and from 100 to 150rpm, corresponding to Reynolds numbers from 1996 to 8807 and from 8807 to 12,357, respectively. That is to say, when the stirring speed of 10-L reactor was greater than 100rpm, its mixing condition would change from laminar flow to turbulent flow. Comparing flow conditions with total acid and alcohol productions listed in Table 3 elucidates that production of alcohol was better than that of acid while the reactor was under a turbulent flow. 3.3.3 H 2 yield Fig. 7C illustrates the influences of pH and stirring speed on H 2 yield. The developed trends were similar to those of specific H 2 production rate (Rs) and a high Ps occurred at pH of 6.0 and stirring speed of 100rpm. In order to assess the relationships among Ps, Rs, and λ , Pearson correlation analysis with data listed in Table 4 produced Pearson correlation coefficients, r of Ps vs. Rs, Ps vs. λ , and Rs vs. λ , 0.91, - 0.44 , - 0.55 , respectively. An examination of these r’s shows that there was high correlation between Ps and Rs; and λ correlated poorly with individual Ps and Rs, in fact negative correlations with them were obtained."
8,Relationship of H 2 production to various pH and stirring speeds,"3.4 Relationship of H 2 production to various pH and stirring speeds To depict the effects of both pH and stirring speeds on H 2 -producing yield, lag, and specific H 2 production rate, it is possible to use the probability (quadratic polynomial) model (refer to Eq. (5)). This model can be used to evaluate the effects of the parameters, pH and stirring speed, through linear, squared, and interaction terms on the variable H 2 yield, lag, and specific H 2 production rate. The data listed in Table 4 were subjected to multiple regression and generated the coefficients as listed in Table 5 . A comparison of R 2 listed in Table 5 confirms that Eqs. (6), (7), and (8) explain the proportion of the variability in the Ps, the Rs, and the λ as 0.73, 0,79, and 0.68, respectively. These poor R 2 results implied the existence of other unknown variables. Here, it should be noted that H 2 is an intermediate of acidogenesis in an anaerobic fermentation. Data illustrated in Figs. 3, 5, and 6 were good diagnostic evidence for that. The organics are converted to acids and alcohols as well as H 2 . On the other hand, t-values listed in Table 5 indicate that the significance of coefficients β 12 , β 2 , and β 22 of Ps, Rs, and λ was much lower than that of β 1 and β 11 . This implies that stirring speed would not directly influence the λ and the Ps because β 12 and β 22 are coefficients of interaction and squared terms, respectively. Sensitivity analysis [i.e., comparing Eqs. (6)–(8)] reveals that Rs, Ps, and λ would increase from 50 to 160mL H 2 / gTVS / d , 2 to 14mL H 2 / gTVS , and decrease from 4 to 8 days, respectively, while (pH, stirring speed) varied from (5.2, 40rpm) to (6.0, 120rpm). Consequently, it is possible to quantitatively determine the optimal pH and stirring speed for H 2 production by considering Eq. (6) together with Eq. (7). According to the Newton algorithm obtained, the optimum conditions approximated pH 6.0 and stirring speed of 120 rpm , giving Ps and Rs of 13mL H 2 / gTVS and 161mL H 2 / gTVS / d , respectively."
9,Confirmation experiments,"3.5 Confirmation experiments A 100-L reactor was used to confirm the effect of stirring speed on anaerobes converting high solids to H 2 . Our experiences indicated that it was difficult to obtain stable H 2 production when the reactor was fed continuously. Therefore, a semi-batch feed of twice per day of 16L of 3% spent grains per time was used. The reactor reached a quasi-HRT of 3 days. To achieve laminar and turbulent flows, two stirring speeds, 40 and 100rpm, were selected. Fig. 8 illustrates the H 2 production variations of the reactor under those stirring speeds. An examination of Fig. 8A reveals that as charging occurred there was significant stimulation of H 2 production from around 5 to 20L/d when the stirring speed was maintained at 40rpm (i.e., laminar flow). However, the same charging regime on the reactor did not produce similar H 2 production when stirring speed was 100rpm as shown in Fig. 8B. While we have not been able to explain this phenomenon, these results together with those of 10-L experiments indicated that H 2 yield was dependent on stirring speed while laminar flow prevailed."
10,Conclusions,"Twenty-four batch runs of 10-L experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of pH and stirring speed on the anaerobes converting 3% spent grains to H 2 . Two sequencing-batch runs of 100-L experiments were conducted to confirm the above operational strategies. Our results show that: 1. A high COD reduction of 37.1% could be obtained from the 10-L reactor at pH of around 5.5–6.0 and stirring speed of around 100rpm. This stirring speed for the 10-L reactor set a threshold where the H 2 -producing anaerobes shifted from H 2 /fatty acid production to alcohol production. 2. The pH was a more important factor than the stirring speed in shortening H 2 production lag and enhancing the yield. Accordingly, the optimal condition of pH of 6.0 and stirring speed of 120rpm obtained from the 10-L reactor by considering H 2 -producing rate together with the yield gave 161mL H 2 / gTVS / d and 13mL H 2 / gTVS . 3. Ten-L experimental results of H 2 production rate indicate that the anaerobes could shift their metabolisms from H 2 /acid production phase to alcohol production phase when the stirring condition was changed from laminar flow to turbulent flow. 4. Stable and reproducible H 2 production rate increased from 5 to 20L/day when the 100-L reactor operated in laminar flow and in sequencing batch mode with a quasi-HRT of 3 days."
