0,Introduction,"Spinel structured oxide materials have gained considerable attention in the material science field, because of their interesting properties, such as, magnetic, semiconducting, catalytic, and optical properties [1]. Attention was first drawn to their optical properties, since CoAl2O4 has been a historic blue pigment for a long time till today, for instance as a contrast-enhancing luminescent pigment. Cobalt aluminate powders have been widely used as inorganic ceramic blue pigments (Thenard’s Blue) [2]. The general formula of spinels is AB2O4. In the spinel structure, the anions are arranged in a cubic close packed array with the cations arranged in the holes of the array. There are eight tetrahedral and four octahedral holes per molecule. In case of normal spinels, the A2+ ions occupy the tetrahedral holes and B3+ ions are present in the octahedral holes. In case of inverse spinels, one half of A2+ ions occupy the tetrahedral holes and the remaining A2+ and all B3+ ions occupy the octahedral holes. Cobalt aluminates are also of great interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. CoAl2O4 has the normal spinel structure in which Co2+ ions are accommodated in tetrahedral positions, while Al3+ ions are in octahedral positions [3]. The major area of organic synthesis deals with the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. Among these, aromatic aldehydes are important for the preparation of fragrances and flavors, hence, a lot of attention is given to their effective production. Liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde has widely attracted the researchers, because it has tremendous applications in cosmetics, perfumery, food, dye stuff, agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. It is considered as the second most important aromatic molecule after vanillin [4]. Liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol using hydrogen peroxide is more convenient, because the oxidant has high content of active oxygen and is cheap, mild and environmentally benign [5]. Recently, CoAl2O4 has been prepared by a number of methods, such as co-precipitation [6,7], sol–gel [8,9], hydrothermal synthesis [10,11], and low temperature combustion [12]. Microwave technique is extensively used for the synthesis of various nanomaterials. Since, microwave heating is an in situ mode of energy conversion; they are fundamentally different from the conventional heating processes. In a microwave oven, due to the interaction of micro-waves with the material, the heat is generated within the sample itself. In conventional method, the heat is generated by heating the elements, and then it is transferred to the sample surface [13]. The use of microwave method has several advantages. The foremost of which are the shortened periods of synthesis, enhanced reaction kinetics, and the reactant selectivity, during the energy transfer from the microwave field, which assists the stabilization of the metastable phase of the material [14]. Nowdays, the plant extract has been used as both reducing and gelling agent for the synthesis of metal oxides. The plant extract plays not only a fuel role, but also has a coordinating action, capturing the involved metal ions in the amylose helix of the plant extract, impeding the separation of metal oxides [15]. Sesame indicum L., has been used extensively as a traditional food in the orient for various purposes and commonly known as sesame. Sesame (S. indicum) is an important oilseed crop that is cultivated for its edible oil, protein, vitamins, antioxidants and amino acids. Natural antioxidants, such as, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, curcumanoids, xanthons, phenolics, lignans, sucrose, tartaric, oxalic acid and terpenoids are found in various plant products (fruits, leaves, seeds and oils, and they are known to protect easily oxidizable constituents from oxidation. Hence, there is a tendency towards the use of natural antioxidants of plant origin to replace these synthetic antioxidants. S. indicum L. may be used as a reducing agent in the preparation of metal oxide precursor powders. [16]. In this work, cobalt aluminate nanoparticles were obtained by both microwave method and conventional method. Benzyl alcohol oxidation tests were carried out to study the influence of the preparation method on the catalytic activity of the nano CoAl2O4 samples. The best activity and selectivity towards the catalytic oxidation were observed from the one prepared by a microwave method."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cobalt nitrate (98% purity) and aluminum nitrate (97% purity) were used as the starting material, (Merck chemicals, India) and were used as received without further purification. The Sesamum (S. indicum L.) leaves were collected from local agricultural fields, Ariyalur, Chennai, Tamilnadu."
3,Preparation of the plant extract,"2.2 Preparation of the plant extract The fresh green leaves, Sesamum (S. indicum L.) were washed three times with ultra-pure water to remove the unwanted dust particles. The leaf extract used for the synthesis was prepared as follows: 50g of thoroughly washed leaves is taken in 250ml beaker, boiled, and stirred in 100ml ultra-pure water for 45min to obtain the clear solution. The resulting solution is called as Sesamum extract."
4,Synthesis of cobalt aluminate,"2.3 Synthesis of cobalt aluminate Cobalt nitrate and aluminum nitrate were dissolved in de-ionized water and then mixed with Sesamum (S. indicum L.) extract under constant stirring for 5h, at room temperature until a clear transparent solution was obtained. The molar ratio of Co/Al was kept as 1:2. The solution was dried in an air oven at 170°C for 3h. The powders were then sintered at 600°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min for 3h in a muffle furnace and was labeled as sample A (prepared by CM). The above-said clear transparent solution was placed in a domestic microwave-oven (2.45GHz, 900W) for 20min. Initially, the solution boiled and underwent dehydration followed by the decomposition with the evolution of gases. It vaporized the solution and instantly became a solid, and it was labeled as sample B (prepared by MM)."
5,Characterization of nano cobalt aluminate,"2.4 Characterization of nano cobalt aluminate The structural studies were carried out using a Philips X’pert diffractometer for 2θ values ranging from10 to 80° using Cu Kα radiation at λ=0.154nm. A Perkin Elmer infrared spectrophotometer was used for the determination of the surface functional groups of the nanomaterials. Morphological studies and energy dispersive X-ray analysis have been performed using a Jeol JSM6360 scanning electron microscope. The samples were coated with gold by a gold sputtering device for the better visibility of the surface morphology. Transmission electron microscopy, TEM, (CM200 FEG PHILIPS) was used to determine the shape and the average size of the crystallites. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples were measured by the using an automatic adsorption instrument (Quantachrome Quadrawin gas sorption analyzer) for the determination of surface area and total pore volume. The diffuse reflectance UV–Visible spectra of the nanomaterials were recorded using Cary100 UV–Visible spectrophotometer. The emission properties were recorded using Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer. The oxidized product after the catalytic reaction is collected and studied using Agilent GC technique. The column used for the study was DB wax column (capillary column) of length 30mm and helium was used as the carrier gas."
6,Catalytic test,"2.5 Catalytic test The oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a batch reactor operated under atmospheric conditions. 5mmol of oxidant (H2O2) was added along with 0.5g of the cobalt aluminate (sample A and sample B), and the contents were heated at 80°C in acetonitrile medium for 5h in a three necked round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and thermometer."
7,Results and discussion,
8,X-ray diffraction analysis,"3.1 X-ray diffraction analysis The purity and crystallinity of the CoAl2O4 nanoparticles were examined by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) showed the XRD pattern of the sample A (prepared by CM), and Fig. 1(b) displayed the XRD pattern of sample B (prepared by MM). It revealed that both the samples A and B had the same crystalline structure. The peaks appearing at 2θ=31.32°, 36.90°, 44.88°, 55.65°, 59.45° and 65.25°, can be indexed as (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystal planes of the cubic crystalline structure of CoAl2O4 respectively, in accordance with the standard JCPDS for a cubic spinel-type CoAl2O4 (JCPDS File No. 82-2251). The main diffraction peak (36.90°) of cubic spinel cobalt aluminate at the (311) plane was considered as a measure of its degree of crystallinity. A minor peak in the XRD pattern close to (311) reflection is assigned. The XRD pattern shows that the product is single-phase, and the peaks detected were the characteristic peaks of the cubic CoAl2O4. This result confirms that the CoAl2O4 nanoparticles obtained in this work are of very high purity. The average crystallite size for both the samples was calculated using Scherrer formula [17]. L = 0.89 λ β cos θ where, L is the average crystallite size (Å), λ, the X-ray wavelength (0.154nm), θ, the diffraction angle and β, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the observed peak. The peak position and the FWHM are obtained by fitting the measured peaks with two Gaussian curves in order to find the true peak position and width corresponding to the monochromatic Cu Kα radiation. The breadth of the Bragg peak is the combination of both instrument and sample broadening effects. Hence, the line broadening due to the instrument has to be decoupled with that of the sample by recording the diffraction pattern and studying the line broadening of a standard material, such as, silicon. The instrumental corrected broadening [18] β corresponding to the diffraction peak of zinc aluminates was estimated using the relation, β = [ β 2 measured − β 2 instrumental ] 1 / 2 The average crystallite size for the samples A and B was found to be 24.90 and 18.83nm, respectively, and is calculated for the reflection peak (36.90°) and 311, which possesses both higher angle and reasonable intensity. An increase in the crystallite size of the sample A is possible on calcination (600°C/3h), because the CM is high-energy consuming and requires rather long reaction times. The rapid microwave method leads to a fast reaction and the average crystal size of sample B is 18.83nm. The reduced crystallite size together with the formation of spinel phase at relatively low temperatures is the two strong arguments for the efficiency and utility of the proposed synthetic route to prepare nano cobalt aluminate. Hence, preparation of single phase spinel nano particles at lower temperatures makes this method technically simple and cost effective."
9,FT-IR analysis,"3.2 FT-IR analysis Infrared studies were performed aiming to ascertain the metal–oxygen and nature of the synthesized of CoAl2O4. The FT-IR spectra of the samples A and B are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Both the spectra showed the metal–oxygen stretching frequencies in the range 500–950cm−1 associated with the vibrations of M–O, Al–O and M–O–Al bonds. These spectra showed the presence of three bands centered at 758–753, 657–652, and 557–550cm−1, respectively. These bands are characteristic for cobalt aluminate spinel structure. The absorption peak of the sample A undergoes a shift in frequency for H2O molecules ranging from 3451–3436cm−1 and 1604–1578cm−1, and becomes weaker, when compared with the sample B, thus indicating the reduction in the degree of binding of H2O on the surface of greater crystallites [19]. In general, this shift of the absorption peaks toward the shift in Al–OH suggests that the Co–OH groups were changed and transformed to the Al–O–Co bonds [20,21]. The absorption at 2800–1000cm−1 was assigned to the deformation mode of Al–OH and Co–OH, which is typical of this class of materials. The strong absorption band at 2823–2806cm−1 is originated from the mode of CO 3 2 − ion. The presence of this CO2 is either because of the presence of aerial CO2 or may be because of the presence of CO2 inside the grains of powders [22]. Three bands observed at 500–950cm−1 are characteristic of cobalt aluminate spinels (for both sample A and B). These bands correspond to the AlO6 units, which build up the CoAl2O4 spinel, and indicate the formation of CoAl2O4 spinels for both sample A and B [23]. In this present work, the bands of FT-IR spectrum has confirmed the presence of the pure spinel-type CoAl2O4. In fact, the intensities and positions of the absorption bands depend strongly on the method and conditions of preparation [24]. No other intermediate phases are detected by the FT-IR spectra, which is in agreement with the results obtained by XRD."
10,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies,"3.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies Morphologies of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and are shown in Fig. 3. It is evident that the structures of the nanoparticles are nearly spherical-like with various sizes. Although, the particles are agglomerated, the boundaries between the crystallites are observable. SEM images of CoAl2O4 prepared by CM were shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), which confirmed the presence of agglomerated nanoparticles (sample A). Fig. 3(c) and (d) showed the formation of CoAl2O4 nanoparticles obtained for the sample B. Therefore, we can infer that CoAl2O4 nanoparticles are formed in both CM and MM. It can be observed that the particle size possesses a narrow size distribution in a range from 25.33–30.45 to 14.39–19.56nm. Actually, the mean particle size determined by SEM is very close to the average particle size calculated by the Debye–Scherrer formula from the XRD pattern. However, the observed difference in the particle size calculated by XRD and as observed by SEM may be due to the molecular structural disorder and lattice strain, which is resulted from the different ionic radii and/or clustering of the nanoparticles [25]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of CoAl2O4 spinels is strongly dependent on the shape, size, and size distribution of the particles. In order to confirm the formation of cobalt aluminate, EDX analysis was carried out on all the samples and a typical data on the (Co, Al and O) peaks have indicated the presence of CoAl2O4 phase without any other impurity. EDX spectrum of cobalt aluminate samples are shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f), for sample A and B, respectively. It is in good agreement with the XRD analysis. The peaks at 2.1, 10.11 and 12.2keV in the EDX spectra were due to the gold coated on the samples before recording HR-SEM."
11,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies,"3.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies The size and shape of the CoAl2O4 nanoparticles were investigated by TEM, as shown in Fig. 4. The presence of nanoparticles of bigger size for the sample A prepared by CM is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Fig. 4(c) and (d) shows the presence of CoAl2O4 nanoparticles of smaller size obtained from sample B, which is prepared by MM. The TEM image reveals that the powder is composed of loosely aggregated extremely fine particles. From this image, it is evident that the particles have a semi-spherical morphology, a narrow size distribution, and homogeneous shape. The size of nanoparticles was measured and the particle size distribution can be seen in Fig. 4(a)–(d). The majority of the particles have sizes in the range of 23.29–21.09nm to 18.56–16.17nm (for samples A and B), which is in accordance with those obtained by using Scherrer’s equation from the XRD pattern. From the data obtained by the HR–TEM micrograph, a particle-size histogram is drawn, and the mean size of the particles can be determined. The particle size distribution histogram is shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a) and (c). It was observed that both the nanoparticles obtained were spherical-like shape and the size is in the range of 10–28 and 10–26nm sample A and B respectively, and the mean particle size is about 24 and 20nm. This has proved a well dispersion of nano-CoAl2O4 particles in the formulation. Also, the mean particle size determined by HR–TEM is very close to the average particle size calculated by the Debye–Scherrer formula from the XRD pattern. The value of the average particle size is close to the mean crystallite size of samples A and B (21.18 to 16.39nm) determined from the calculation based on the XRD data. The small differences are inherent to the calculation or measuring errors [26]. Only a slightly difference is observed in the particle size of the samples measured by the XRD and TEM, and it may be due to the fact that the TEM measurements are based on the difference between the visible grain boundaries, while XRD calculations measure the extended crystalline region that diffracts X-rays coherently. Hence, the XRD method has a more stringent criterion and leads to smaller sizes [27]."
12,Diffuse reflectance spectral (DRS) studies,"3.5 Diffuse reflectance spectral (DRS) studies The good crystallinity of the nanoparticles is reflected on the blue color of the material. The energy-level for Co2+ (3d7 configuration), in both octahedral and tetrahedral ligand fields presents the three spin-allowed transitions. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of cobalt aluminate nanoparticles prepared by using CM and MM (samples A and B). The color of the cobalt aluminates is due to d–d transitions. The first peak at 640–440nm is assigned to the 4A2 (4F)→4T1 (4P) transition and the broad absorption band in the near-infrared is assigned to the 4A2 (4F)→4T1 (4F) transition of tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ ions. A second band around 430–360nm is associated with the 4T1 (F)→4T1 (P) transition of Co2+ in octahedral environments. The third band from (250–350nm) is associated to 1A1g→1T2g transition. In addition, an absorption band at 300–500nm appears in the spectrum. With regard to the above discussions and the cation distribution previously characterized, this new band, leading to a blue color, could be due to the Co2+ ions in the octahedral sites. The similar band is generated by octahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions [28–30]. This triple band creates the blue coloration, for the samples A and B (Fig. 5), which was prepared by using plant extract. It shows absorption bands at 518–511, 426–423, and 276–273nm, with a slight shift to lower wavelengths, whereas the blue samples showed a broad band maximum at lower wavelengths (blue shift). This shift indicates that the crystal size reduction has resulted in the improved blue color, for the sample B than the sample A with larger crystal size. However, further detailed study is necessary to confirm whether the blue shift is because of the reduction in the crystal size [31]."
13,Photoluminescence (PL) studies,"3.6 Photoluminescence (PL) studies The optical properties of the cobalt aluminates were studied by means of luminescence spectroscopy. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared by sample A (CM) and sample B (MM), respectively, are measured at room temperature in the wavelength range of 350–700nm and are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). In general, PL of cobalt aluminate shows the strong emission bands in violet (400–450nm), blue (450–490nm), green (490–560nm), yellow (560–590), orange (~590–635), and red (635–700nm) emission bands in the visible region. Moreover, the nature of the PL spectrum of cobalt aluminate spinel depends on the preparation methods [32]. The violet emission peak with weaker intensity around 430nm (423nm, 420nm) and the blue emission peak around 480nm (479 and 473nm) have been formed in the samples A and B. One green emission peak with stronger intensity around 530nm (532 and 528), yellow emission peak around 590nm (575 and 572) and the red emission peak around 700nm (673 and 670nm) have also been formed (Fig. 6). The violet emission peaks could be due to the radiating defects related to the interface traps existing at the grain boundaries. The peaks corresponding to the blue emission could represent a deep level visible emissions associated with the localized levels. The peaks corresponding to the green emissions may be attributed to the oxygen vacancies [33]. Yellow emission peak centered might be attributed to the radiative transition between the conduction band and defect states or defect states and valance band. The yellow emission related to the defects, such as, oxygen interstitials, and oxygen vacancies dominates among the deep level emission. The deep level yellow emission might have mainly originated from the oxygen interstitials [34]. The results were almost consistent with the energy of the red emission broad peaks around 700nm, and is attributed to the transition of the electrons from the surface states to the cobalt aluminate. Hence, the red emissions are related to the oxygen defects [35]. The shifts of the PL peak positions and peak intensity in both the blue and green regions toward lower wavelengths may be due to their crystal sizes [36]."
14,Surface area analysis,"3.7 Surface area analysis From the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm values at 77K of the cobalt aluminate, which the specific surface areas (S BET) together with the average pore radius (R p ) and total pore volume (V p ) are displayed in Table 1. The specific surface area and the pore volume can be increased, while maintaining a relatively constant pore radius with the optimal amount of filler loading in the cobalt aluminate nanoparticles. The specific surface area was obtained by using BET equation to measure the adsorbed amount of nitrogen on cobalt aluminate nanoparticles. The average pore radius was obtained by the H–K method, and the total pore volume and pore volume was attained by the t-plot [37]. The lowest surface area of 59m2/g is obtained for sample A as a consequence of the high flame temperature achieved during the CM. But for sample B by MM, it is increased to 94m2/g. The pore volume of sample A is 0.0747cm3/g, whereas for the sample B, it is 0.0958cm3/g. Similarly, the average pore diameter of the sample B is higher 8.59Å, but for the sample A, it is only 7.36Å. Nevertheless, the CoAl2O4 nanoparticles prepared by the MM were of narrower distribution than those prepared by the CM. It is well known that the formation of nanoparticles prepared by CM and MM depends strongly on the heating condition."
15,Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde,"3.8 Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde 3.8.1 Catalytic activities The BzOH oxidation to BzH happens as per following reaction: C 6 H 5 CH 2 OH + H 2 O 2 ⟹ Acetonitrile Catalyst C 6 H 5 CHO + 2 H 2 O The reaction progress was investigated under acetonitrile, hydrogen peroxide, cobalt aluminate, at 80°C, for 8h. 3.8.2 Mechanism of catalytic oxidation Cobalt aluminate nanoparticles were found to be good heterogeneous catalysts in acetonitrile medium for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using H2O2 as an oxidant. In the catalytic reaction mixture, only benzaldehyde was found as an oxidation product. In our study, solvent acetonitrile can activate the hydrogen peroxide by forming a perhydroxyl anion (OOH−) that nucleophilically attacks the nitrile to generate a peroxycarboximidic acid intermediate, which is a good oxygen transfer agent. Both organic substrate as well as the oxidant H2O2 dissolves in acetonitrile forming a uniform solution. The introduction of oxygen into reaction system form coordinated perhydroxyl anion (Co–OOH•) species. These observations reveal that the phenyl ring and the OH group of benzyl alcohol interact with the metal (Co2+) ion of CoAl2O4 and the inner active sites remains intact. The interaction of the phenyl ring and the OH group with the outer metal ions of CoAl2O4 is also evident by the adsorption of phenyl ring on CoAl2O4 [38]. But, the active sites are regenerated by the action of the oxidant with the catalyst, which leads to the desorption of the product molecules, thereby favoring the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The catalytic oxidation of BzOH should be attributed to the increase in the active sites; which may be due to the decomposition of H2O2 to H2O, and thereby it increases the catalytic activity. Therefore, it is likely that the benzyl alcohol, acetonitrile and H2O2 interact with CoAl2O4 effectively and the product is formed [39–41]. Based on the catalytic oxidation, a possible reaction path is shown in Scheme 1. 3.8.3 Oxidation kinetics of benzyl alcohol The liquid phase catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol using cobalt aluminate samples was evaluated using the linearized form of pseudo first order kinetics [42,43]. Pseudo - first order : ln ( C t / C o ) = − k SA ρ A ( t ) = − k obs ( t ) Here, C o , is the initial benzyl alcohol concentration, C t , the benzyl alcohol concentration at time t; k, represents the apparent reaction rate constant; and t, represents the reaction time. k SA is the surface normalized reaction rate constant (h/m2/l), and ρ A is the specific surface area concentration of the catalyst in the solution (m2/l). The surface normalized reaction rate or the specific reaction rate, k SA is equal to the observed rate constant (k obs) divided by the specific surface area concentration ρ A . The k obs values were calculated from the linearized plot of the pseudo first order rate model and later on was used for the calculation of specific reaction constant (k SA). From Fig. 7(a) and (b) it is seen that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde follows the pseudo first order rate kinetics as observed from the regression analysis that is greater than 0.999. Providing more surface active sites in cobalt aluminate will accelerate the efficiency towards the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In conclusion, the higher the specific surface area and the higher surface reactivity, higher will be benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde oxidation [44]. The surface normalized rate constant k SA obtained for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using the samples A and B was 0.094h−1 and 0.199h−1 respectively. A notable higher value of k SA in sample B shall be attributed to the increase in the surface active sites that was easily accessible for the reactants, and thus favoring the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Lower conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde for sample A may be due to the presence of fewer catalytic sites ( Table 2). The activity of the catalysts was related to the high surface area and small crystal size of sample B, which has favored the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol [45]. The catalytic activity of the cobalt aluminate was investigated by the examining its use in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in acetonitrile medium by using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Generally, benzyl alcohol oxidizes into benzaldehyde, benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate. However, only benzaldehyde was characterized as the oxidation product in the present case. Blank reaction performed under the same reaction conditions the yield of benzaldehyde as only 2.2% in the controlled experiment without any catalyst and oxidant. In the absence of the oxidant, cobalt aluminate showed only 6.9% yield of benzaldehyde, and in the absence of the catalyst, 17.1% benzaldehyde was produced indicating that the H2O2 alone is unable to oxidize benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde. In order to increase the yield of benzaldehyde, several promoters, such as, cobalt aluminate, H2O2, and solvent were added. Among the three additives, H2O2 was the most effective promoter for achieving the better yield of benzaldehyde. The oxidation of alcohols plays an important role in the organic synthesis, while the development of new oxidative processes continues drawing attention in spite of the availability of numerous oxidizing reagents. Hence, in terms of economic and environmental concern, catalytic oxidation processes with inexpensive and environmental oxidants are extremely valuable. Catalytic activity of in the presence and absence of catalyst/oxidant is shown in Table 3. 3.8.4 Reusability studies The recycle tests were conducted in order to investigate the reusability of the cobalt aluminate catalysts. The reusability performance of cobalt aluminate (A and B) for five cycles of batch oxidation reaction is illustrated in Fig. 8(a) and (b). After the catalytic reaction, CoAl2O4 (A and B) was filtered, washed with ethanol for several times, then dried at 120°C in an air for 3h to remove the ethanol. It was checked for five consecutive runs under identical conditions, during which the conversions and selectivity remained at almost a similar level to that of the first run. CoAl2O4 was found to have no appreciable loss of activity in the recycle tests, thus it was proved that it had a stable structure during the catalytic reaction. The above results demonstrate that nano CoAl2O4 samples could be promising catalytic materials in the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction with high activity and stability. Reusability of the cobalt aluminate (samples A and B) catalysts is shown in Table 4. 3.8.5 Oxidation of other alcohols Since cobalt aluminate samples (A and B) were found to be more active in the catalytic oxidation reaction using acetonitrile as the solvent and H2O2 as the oxidant, various alcohols, such as, p-methoxy benzyl alcohol, 4-nitro benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, 1-phenyl ethanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol were oxidized to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds in good to excellent yields and the results are shown in Tables 5 and 6. A series of substituted benzyl alcohols were selectively oxidized under the optimized conditions. Presence of the electron-withdrawing substituent on the benzene ring enhanced the reaction time and decreased the product yield. Thus, these catalytic systems showed relatively lower conversion rate in comparison with the oxidation of benzyl alcohol [46]."
16,Effects of synthesis,"3.9 Effects of synthesis Nano CoAl2O4 spinel was successfully synthesized by both CM and MM technique using Co (NO3)2·6H2O, and Al (NO3)3·9H2O as starting materials. In this simple and inexpensive method, metal nitrates are dissolved in water by adding a plant extract solution. Because of the high degree of homogenization, much lower temperatures are sufficient for the reaction to occur. Using the plant extract is one of the most accessible, fast and high-energy soft methods for the synthesis of simple and mixed metal oxide materials. According to the experimental results, the color of cobalt-aluminate spinel is strongly related to the successive preparation method. The results proved that the microwave heating system is a fast and easy synthesis method, in which there is no need for preparing the gel; and the solution can directly interact with the microwave and results in a well-developed combustion reaction. While in the conventional heating, the sol should be changed to gel and then converted to the product, due to the low temperature heating in a furnace ( Scheme 2). In this paper, cobalt aluminate nanoparticles were prepared by a conventional and microwave method using the plant extract. From the results, it is clear that the changing of the CM and MM method has great effects on the particle size, optical, and catalytic properties. However, the microwave heating environment gives rise to a rapid and simultaneous nucleation than the conventional heating method. Therefore, the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles with well-controlled size, shape and chemical homogeneity are interesting and important for catalytic purposes. Furthermore, the final powder produced in the microwave heating system has finer crystallites with narrower size distribution in contrast with the sample prepared in the furnace with the same starting raw materials. The plant extract was readily prepared from the inexpensive starting materials in water without using any other reagent. These unusual properties have been attributed to the extremely small sizes and the high specific surface areas of the nanoparticles. It is also well known that the catalytic activity of inorganic materials depends strongly on the particle size, morphology and structure."
17,Comparison of cobalt aluminate activity with other reported methods,"3.10 Comparison of cobalt aluminate activity with other reported methods Transition metal oxides have been receiving increased attention, because they exhibit unusual physical and chemical properties that are significantly different from those of relatively larger particles of the same materials. The different technique promises to be one of the versatile preparation methods, which enables to control the particle properties, such as, mechanisms of particle size control, morphology, homogeneity and surface area. These unusual properties have been attributed to the extremely small sizes and the high specific surface areas of the nanoparticles [47]. The low temperature synthesis technique has been proved to be a novel, extremely facile, time and energy saving route for the synthesis of ultrafine spinels at lower temperatures. In present method, in view of its simplicity and many other unique features, we expected that the combustion method would be useful for providing an alternative of low cost mass production of blue CoAl2O4 ceramic nanopigments. Therefore, we proposed the preparation of CoAl2O4 particles by the MM method at low temperature by using the of plant extract as a new mixed fuel and microwave as an assisted environmentally benign energy source [48,49]. Many researchers reported quasi-spheric or irregular shapes for the CoAl2O4 powders prepared by the sol–gel, complexation, reverse microemulsion method, etc. [50–54]. Table 7 shows the comparison of structure and particle size of CoAl2O4 prepared in the present work and those synthesized by other chemical methods. In the current work, a cobalt aluminate nanoparticle of the powders was attributed to the method of synthesis by using plant extract. But the other preparation procedures were performed for long-time at high temperature. It is also the purpose of the present study to gain more insight on which factors control the formation of the stable phases by the conventional and microwave method."
18,Conclusions,"In summary, increasing awareness towards green chemistry and plant extract processes has led the necessity to employ the environment-friendly approaches for the synthesis of non-toxic and biocompatible nanomaterials. In this study, cobalt aluminate spinel was prepared by using conventional method (sample A) and microwave method (sample B) using Sesamum (S. indicum L.) extract. This shows that the microwave method is more powerful and can achieve the same results within a shorter time when compared to the conventional method. The addition of plant extract controls the formation of cobalt aluminate nanoparticles with a similar and uniform shape and size. The average crystallite size for samples A and B was found to be 24.90 and 18.83nm respectively. The formation of cobalt aluminate phase was confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and the optical properties. The synthesized cobalt aluminate spinel act as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Since, the cobalt aluminate catalyst is able to oxidize BzOH to BzH with high activity, good reusability, remarkable stability and above all, environmentally friendly. Thus, it is concluded that they are promising materials for the industrial applications."
