0,Introduction,"The transformation of monohydric alcohols into various high-value-added chemicals, in particular diols, is one of the most attractive but challenging targets in chemical synthesis [1–4]. Monohydric alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, aromatic alcohols, can be facilely produced from various carbon resources (coal, natural gas, biomass, and organic wastes). These monohydric alcohols are not only versatile chemicals but also building blocks for the production of high-value chemicals [1–4]. Diols, such as ethylene glycol (EG), 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), pinacol, hydrobenzoin, are widely used as feedstocks in lubricant, plasticizer and surfactant, and can also be used as the precursors for manufacturing polyester fibers and resins [5–7]. The direct transformation of monohydric alcohols into diols is an atomic and economic route. At present, most of the diols are prepared through the traditional thermocatalytic processes. Take EG as an example, in industry, ethylene derived from petroleum is first epoxidized to ethylene oxide, which then hydrolyzed to EG [6,7]. However, it is very difficult to directly convert monohydric alcohols to diols in thermocatalysis, because the hydroxyl group is relatively active, and the cleavage of C − O and O − H bonds are easier than C − H bonds at the harsh conditions of thermocatalysis. Therefore, the preferential activation of C − H bond of alcohols and C − C coupling to diols while maintaining the hydroxyl group unchanged is difficult. Photocatalysis provides an alternative route that can preferentially activate the C − H bond in monohydric alcohols without affecting the hydroxyl group and C − C coupling into diols under mild conditions [1–3]. Alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, benzylalcohol, and furfural alcohol have been widely used as the hole sacrificial reagents for photocatalytic H2 evolution [8–14]. The alcohols can be converted into corresponding aldehyde or acetal by selective oxidation on some photocatalysts. Moreover, it is highly interesting that alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, can be converted into diols via C − C coupling on some special photocatalysts [1–3]. Although much progress has been achieved on photocatalytic transformation of monohydric alcohols to diols in recent years, the review article focusing on preferential activation of C − H bond of alcohols and C − C coupling to diols is still lacking. Herein, in this article, we devoted to reviewing recent advances on photocatalytic transformation of typical monohydric alcohols, including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, aromatic alcohols, into diols, such as EG, 2,3-BD, pinacol, hydrobenzoin, through C − C coupling process (Fig. 1 ). The key factors controlling product selectivity and activity are discussed, and the structure–performance relationships for preferential activation of C − H bond of alcohols and C − C coupling to diols are analyzed. The mechanistic insights and future trends in this emerging research area are also discussed."
1,Photocatalytic coupling of methanol,"Methanol is traditionally produced through the syngas process from coal, natural gas and biomass, and has also been directly produced from biomass-derived sugars and CO2 hydrogenation [15,16]. As an abundant and renewable one‑carbon (C1) building block, methanol has been used to produce olefins, aromatics, and oxygenates [17,18]. In photocatalysis, many processes have been developed for transforming methanol into value-added chemicals. The direct photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG is one of the most attractive routes [19–22]. Photocatalytic coupling of methanol and formaldehyde could also produce EG with high selectivity [23]. On the other hand, 1,1-dimethoxymethane (DMM) and ethanol could be obtained in photocatalytic transformation of methanol [24,25]. Moreover, photocatalytic coupling of methanol with terminal olefins could form higher aliphatic alcohols with high efficiency [26,27]. Some typical photocatalysts for methanol conversion and the performances are summarized in Table 1 . EG is an important chemical with global consumption higher than 25 million metric tons per year, and has been used as fuel additives, antifreeze, and monomers for the production of poly(ethylene terephthalate (PET) polymers [5–7]. Compare with the petroleum-derived ethylene industrial route for EG synthesis, the direct coupling of methanol to EG is an ideal process, but has not been achieved in thermocatalysis. The dehydrogenative C − C coupling of methanol to EG and H2 (eq. 1) is a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction, and photocatalysis provides an alternative route for EG synthesis driven by solar energy. (1) 2CH 3 OH → HOCH 2 CH 2 OH + H 2 , ∆G 29 8K = 9.3 kJ mol − 1 Methanol has been widely used as the hole scavenger in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and enhances the HER activity greatly. In most cases, the products of methanol oxidation were C1 derivatives, such as HCHO, HCOOH, CO, and CO2 [8]. At present, only a few studies have found that methanol could be directly photocatalytic coupling into EG on some metal sulfide photocatalysts, such as zinc sulfide (ZnS), cadmium sulfide (CdS), zinc–indium–sulfide (Zn2In2S5) [19,20,22]. In 1984, Yanagida et al. used methanol as a sacrificial electron donor to enhance the photocatalytic production of H2 on ZnS, and found that methanol was converted to EG and H2 under UV-light irradiation [19]. However, ZnS exhibited low activity (Table 1) because it only absorbs the UV light, which accounts for ~4% of the total solar energy in the solar spectrum. In our recent work, we demonstrated the first example of photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG driven by visible-light over MoS2 nanofoam modified CdS nanorod (MoS2/CdS) photocatalyst (Fig. 2a) [20], and this progress has been considered to be a new and sustainable process for the synthesis of EG [21]. Compared with other photocatalysts, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), CdS is quite unique in selective photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG. The preferential activation of inert sp3 α-C − H bond in methanol without affecting the hydroxyl group on the CdS surface could produce hydroxymethyl radical (•CH2OH), which can further form EG via C − C coupling. On CdS surface, the cleavage of C − H bond in methanol to •CH2OH occurred via a concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) mechanism with low activation barrier, and the weak adsorption of •CH2OH facilitates its desorption and coupling to EG [20]. On the other hand, MoS2 nanofoam provided sufficient H2 evolution active sites at the edge and facilitated charge separation, and this can efficiently promote the photocatalytic activity for EG formation. In addition, by using a process-intensified reactor, the selectivity and yield of EG were achieved 90% and 16%, respectively, after 100 h reaction (Fig. 2b). Besides MoS2/CdS, the cobalt phosphide (CoP) modified Zn2In2S5, an environmentally friendly photocatalyst, also showed a good selectivity (90%) for photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG under the simulated sunlight irradiation [22]. The photocatalytic dehydrogenative coupling of methanol to EG and H2 has provided a promising way for EG and H2 coproduction under mild conditions driven by solar energy. Fan et al. reported that EG could form from the photocatalytic coupling of methanol and formaldehyde over Pt/TiO2 under UV-light irradiation [23]. The EG selectivity could reach 80%. It is very interesting that only a trace amount of EG was formed over Pt/TiO2 while using methanol as reactant, but the addition of formaldehyde significantly promoted the EG formation rate (Fig. 3a). The EG formation rate increased first and then decreased with the amount of formaldehyde raised, and this implies that formaldehyde affects EG formation. In addition, low temperature benefited the formation of EG [23]. Mechanistic studies illustrated that the •CH2OH radical was generated by hole oxidation and quickly captured by formaldehyde to form EG in this system (Fig. 3b). Besides EG, DMM can also be produced through photocatalytic conversion of methanol under light irradiation. Chao et al. demonstrated the conversion of methanol to DMM over CdS/Ni2P under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 4a) [24]. The formation rate of DMM could reach 188 mmol g−1 h−1 with a selectivity of 83%. Methanol was oxidized by the photogenerated holes on CdS nanorods surface to form the •CH2OH intermediate, which would easily oxidize to formaldehyde. Furthermore, the formed formaldehyde reacts with methanol rapidly to obtain DMM (Fig. 4a). Sulphuric acid plays an important role in this aldolisation process. Moreover, light-driven one-step conversion of methanol to ethanol with high selectivity at mild conditions was reported by Liu et al., catalyzed by a gallium nitride (GaN) nanowire photocatalyst [25]. Mechanistic studies revealed that methyl carbene (methylene), as a reaction intermediate, was generated on the polar c-plane surface of GaN, then the methyl carbene can insert into the C − H bond of methanol to give ethanol (Fig. 4b). By decreasing the reaction temperature, n-propanol could also form from photocatalytic conversion of methanol on GaN, and this implies that methyl carbene can further insert into the C − H bond of ethanol to obtain n-propanol. On the other hand, the C − H activation of methanol to form •CH2OH radical make it can work as a hydroxymethylation agent to react with many other reactants to generate alcohols. Zhong and co-workers demonstrated a promising route for photocatalytic conversion of methanol and terminal olefins to longer aliphatic alcohols [26,27]. Pt/TiO2 and CdS were found to be efficient for this reaction under UV-light and visible-light irradiation, respectively. Mechanistic studies showed that photogenerated holes oxidized methanol to •CH2OH radicals, which would attack the terminal olefins to form longer aliphatic alcohols with the synergetic reduction of photogenerated electrons (Fig. 4c). These studies provide a green and sustainable strategy for synthesizing various alcohols by photocatalytic coupling of methanol and olefins [26,27]."
2,Photocatalytic coupling of ethanol,"As an important biomass platform molecule, ethanol has been considered as a potential alternative to petroleum due to its compatibility with current infrastructure [28]. The annual production of ethanol has rapidly increased and reached 100 billion Liter in 2013. Nowadays, various interests have been focused on the transformation of ethanol into high added-value chemicals. 2,3-BD is a versatile platform chemical and potential aviation fuel that has a wide range of industrial application in cosmetics, food, transport fuels, which has been produced by a bacterial fermentation pathway traditionally [29]. Thus, the direct coupling of ethanol to 2,3-BD is an atom-economical green synthesis route with great attraction. A number of progress have been achieved in the field of photocatalytic coupling of ethanol to 2,3-BD, and have provided a promising route for 2,3-BD synthesis [20–35]. Some typical photocatalysts and the performances are summarized in Table 2 . Similar to photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG, ZnS also showed good selectivity for photocatalytic coupling of ethanol to 2,3-BD [30]. Müller et al. found that ZnS particles with different sizes have different selectivities toward acetaldehyde or 2,3-BD [30]. Ethanol was selectively oxidized to acetaldehyde on micrometer-sized ZnS particles without other products by a “two-hole” process. On nanometer-sized ZnS particles, α-hydroxyethyl radicals (•CH(OH)CH3) were formed via a “one-hole” process for subsequent C − C coupling to 2,3-BD. They proposed that micrometer-sized ZnS would absorb multi-photons for multi-electrons and multi-protons transfer to generate acetaldehyde, while nanometer-sized ZnS would absorb single-photon and oxidize ethanol to •CH(OH)CH3 without further oxidation. TiO2 with proper structure also showed good selectivity for photocatalytic coupling of ethanol to 2,3-BD, although almost no EG was observed in photocatalytic conversion of methanol on TiO2. Lu et al. found that the crystalline phase of TiO2 has a significant effect on the selectivity of the products [31]. The commercial TiO2 powder (Degussa P25) with ~80% anatase phase and ~ 20% rutile phase showed a selectivity of 84% toward acetaldehyde and acetal in photocatalytic conversion of ethanol (Fig. 5a). After calcination at 900￮C, the crystalline phase of TiO2 was transformed into the pure rutile phase, and the selectivity of 2,3-BD was increased to 97% (Fig. 5a). They proposed that a higher density of surface hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2(P25) results in the high selectivity of acetaldehyde and acetal, and the weaker adsorption of •CH(OH)CH3 on rutile TiO2 surfaces favors the subsequent C − C coupling to 2,3-BD (Fig. 5b). Moreover, TiO2 nanotubes could bring a negative effect on the 2,3-BD selectivity, and the selectivity of 2,3-BD is only about 53% on rutile TiO2 nanotubes [31]. The reaction intermediates, •CH(OH)CH3, would be further oxidized to acetaldehyde or CO2 by oxygen-containing radicals and additional holes, and this would result in the low selectivity of 2,3-BD (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, Yang et al. systematically studied the effect of surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 on the selectivity of 2,3-BD in photocatalytic conversion of ethanol [32]. The increasing of surface hydroxyl groups on TiO2 would decrease the selectivity of photocatalytic conversion of ethanol to 2,3-BD. The substitution of surface hydroxyl groups on TiO2(P25) with fluorine could enhance the selectivity of 2,3-BD from 2.6% to 65% [32]. They found that the increasing of the surface hydroxyl groups on TiO2 photocatalyst would increase the amount of hydroxyl radical (•OH), which would result in the overoxidation of •CH(OH)CH3 intermediate into acetaldehyde. Thus, the less the surface hydroxyl groups of photocatalyst, the higher the selectivity of 2,3-BD. On the other hand, Li et al. found that, with the assistance of the H2O2 photolysis, the α-C − H bond of ethanol could be activated by hydroxyl radicals (•OH) to form •CH(OH)CH3 radicals without catalysts, which would subsequently C − C coupling to 2,3-BD [33]. The control of •OH concentration in solution is very important for the selectivity of 2,3-BD. The selectivity of 2,3-BD could increase from 36.5% to 93.1% while reducing the H2O2 concentration from 0.96 mol L−1 to 0.12 mol L−1 [33]. Thus, the steering of surface hydroxyl groups on semiconductor and the hydroxyl radicals in reaction solution are two effective strategies for promoting the selectivity of 2,3-BD in photocatalytic conversion of ethanol. ZnS and TiO2 are both UV-light responsive semiconductors, thus the development of visible-light responsive photocatalyts for C − C coupling of ethanol to 2,3-BD is also very important. Zhang et al. found that CoP/Zn2In2S5 could not only work for photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG but also for photocatalytic coupling of ethanol to 2,3-BD under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 6a) [17]. The Zn/In molar ratio of Zn m In2S m+3 (m = 1–3) showed a significant effect on product selectivity, ZnIn2S4 only produced acetaldehyde, while Zn2In2S5 and Zn3In2S6 have selectivities toward 2,3-BD higher than 40% (Fig. 6b). The modification of Zn2In2S5 with CoP could promote the formation of 2,3-BD, showing a 2,3-BD selectivity and formation rate of 53% and 3.2 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively (Fig. 6c). The photocatalytic C − C coupling of ethanol into 2,3-BD opens a new way for green and energy-efficient utilization of biomass."
3,Photocatalytic coupling of isopropanol,"Isopropanol is widely used as organic chemical raw material and organic solvent, such as solvent for coatings and inks. The 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol (pinacol) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of polymers, pharmaceuticals and pesticides [37]. The direct coupling of isopropanol to pinacol is a simple and efficient route for pinacol synthesis. Some typical photocatalysts and the performances for photocatalytic coupling of isopropanol to pinacol are summarized in Table 2 [37–39]. Compare with photocatalytic conversion of methanol and ethanol, TiO2 showed similar performances in photocatalytic conversion of isopropanol to that of ethanol. Lu et al. reported that isopropanol can be transformed into the pinacol over TiO2(P25) at room temperature under UV-light irradiation [37]. The calcination temperatures of TiO2(P25) affected the selectivity of pinacol significantly (Fig.7a). The original TiO2(P25) exhibit a low pinacol selectivity of 1.2% with isopropanol conversion of 37%. After calcination at 600 °C, the pinacol selectivity increased to 32% with isopropanol conversion of 46%. A pure rutile phase TiO2 was obtained after calcination at 800 °C, which showed a pinacol selectivity of 90% with isopropanol conversion of 14%, and yield of pinacol could reach 13% [37]. The mechanism studies reveal that isopropanol was oxidized by photogenerated holes to form 2-hydroxy-2-propyl radicals (•COH(CH3)2), and then C − C coupling to pinacol (Fig. 7b). It is interesting that the further oxidation of side-product acetone was difficult, and acetone could be reduced by photogenerated electrons to form •COH(CH3)2 for sequent C − C coupling to pinacol (Fig. 7b). Moreover, Cao et al. found that graphene oxide (GO) after hydrothermal treatment in NaOH also showed good activity for photocatalytic conversion of isopropanol to pinacol (Table 2) [38] . On the other hand, Li et al. also reported that, with the assistance of the H2O2 photolysis, isopropanol could be photocatalytic coupling to pinacol without catalysts [39]. The selectivity and formation rate of pinacol could reach 92% and 27 mmol h−1 without catalyst under UV-light irradiation. By adding Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst, the pinacol formation rate increased to 29 mmol h−1 while selectivity of pinacol decreased to 82%. The hydroxyl radicals (•OH) form from H2O2 photolysis were the active species for selective activation of α-C − H bond of isopropanol to generate •COH(CH3)2 radicals, which would undergo C − C coupling to pinacol (Fig. 7c)."
4,Photocatalytic coupling of aromatic alcohols,"Aromatic alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol, are important base chemicals and also one class of promising platform compounds that can be derived from various biomass resources [40–42]. Early studies in the field of photocatalysis mainly focused on the oxidation of aromatic alcohol to benzaldehyde [43–49], but few of them selectively obtained high value-added C − C coupling products. Remarkably, a series of C − C coupling products from benzyl alcohol, such as hydrobenzoin, benzoin, and deoxybenzoin, can serve as versatile structural intermediates in the manufacture of numerous chemical additives and upstream pharmaceutical products [50–55]. Nevertheless, in the conventional chemical industry, the synthesis of benzoin and its derivatives are principally focused on Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation of alkenes, which may unavoidably require the use of toxic cyanide and metal complex catalysts, and also result in a host of by-products [56–60]. Thus far, the dehydrogenative coupling of benzyl alcohol to C − C coupling compounds with non-toxic and high selectivity catalytic process is challenging. Photocatalysis has provided a promising route for direct C − C coupling of benzyl alcohol. This section focuses on the recent progress in the transformation of aromatic alcohols to corresponding C − C coupling compounds via photocatalysis (Table 3 ). Currently, the visible-light responsive solid-state semiconductors remain less explored for C − C bond forming reactions. Sun et al. reported a two-dimensional ZnIn2S4 nanosheets for photocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol to benzoin and deoxybenzoin under visible-light irradiation [55]. The yields of benzoin and deoxybenzoin achieved 58% and 40%, respectively, and the total C − C coupling compounds yield reached 98%. Hydrobenzoin was the main reaction intermediate, which could reach a maximal yield of about 70% within 2 h under light irradiation, and further oxidized to benzoin and deoxybenzoin in long-time reaction (Fig. 8a). It was proposed that the photogenerated hole on ZnIn2S4 could preferentially activate the α-C − H bond of benzyl alcohol to yield acrinyl radical intermediate (Fig. 8b). Meanwhile, the formed acrinyl radicals reached a high concentration on the surface of ZnIn2S4 nanosheet, then C − C coupling to hydrobenzoin (Fig. 8b). Moreover, the initially formed hydrobenzoin would be further oxidized to benzoin and deoxybenzoin by photogenerated holes during continued photocatalytic reaction. Analogously, Wang's group has fabricated a series of Zn x In2S3+x photocatalysts with adjustable band structure by varying the molar ratio of Zn/In for photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol [62]. Over Zn0.2In2S3.2, the major product was benzoin (yield 61%), and the total yield of benzoin and deoxybenzoin was 91%. Interestingly, over Zn0.6In2S3.6, although the total yield of benzoin and deoxybenzoin was 80%, the major product shifted to deoxybenzoin with a yield of 64%. They proposed that the key of tuning the major product from benzoin to deoxybenzoin was to decrease the conduction band bottom potentials of the Zn x In2S3+x photocatalysts by increasing the Zn/In ratio, and this results in the dehydration of hydrobenzoin to deoxybenzoin proceeding in a redox-neutral mechanism (Fig. 9 ). Besides Zn x In2S3+x , colloidal CdS quantum dots also showed good selectivity for photocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol to C − C coupling products (primarily hydrobenzoin) with total selectivity of 91% [63]. Although the total selectivity of C − C coupling products was high on previous reported photocatalysts, the selectivity of single product still need to be improved. Very recently, Xu's group demonstrated an electrostatic self-assembly approach to loaded CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto a spherical SiO2 surface, the obtained CdS/SiO2 photocatalyst showed high selectivity (95–100%) for photocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol to hydrobenzoin at ambient temperature and pressure [64]. The SiO2 modifying with branched poly-ethylenimine (BPEI) and the CdS QDs capping 3-mercaptopropionic acid can provide −NH2 and − COOH groups on their surface, respectively (Fig. 10a). In such a scenario, a direct electrostatic interface attraction by coulombic force is realized, by that means robust interfacial interaction between BPEI-SiO2 and CdS QDs would homogeneously distribute CdS QDs on the spherical SiO2 (Fig. 10a). Over 2.5 wt% CdS/SiO2, the formation rate of hydrobenzoin could reach 17 mmol g−1 h−1 with a selectivity of ~99% (Fig. 10b). Compared with bare CdS QDs, the CdS/SiO2 catalyst significantly boosted hydrobenzoin formation rates by 3.7 times, because of the distinctly enhanced photon-to-current conversion efficiency by increasing light-harvesting. In situ electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that the benzyl C − H bond of benzyl alcohol was oxidized on CdS QDs and the α-hydroxybenzyl radical intermediate was generated over CdS/SiO2 catalyst under light irradiation. Subsequently, the as-formed α-hydroxybenzyl radicals could further C − C couple to hydrobenzoin (Fig. 10c). Besides hydrobenzoin, benzoin could also be obtained with high selectivity (97%) in photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol over K+ modified g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation [50]. Photocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol to value-added chemicals coupled with H2 evolution has been proved to be a promising route. Guo et al. demonstrated an alternative route of photocatalytic coupling of aromatic alcohol to value-added chemicals integrated with CO2 reduction [66,67]. This strategy also provided a cost-effective CO2 photoreduction route for efficient solar-to-fuel conversion [68–71]. Taking colloidal CdSe/CdS semiconductor as the photocatalyst realized that highly efficient and selective coupling of 1-phenylethanol to corresponding pinacol coupled with photoreduction of CO2 to CO (Fig. 11a) [66]. The shell thickness of CdS would influence the catalytic performances, when the 3 atomic layers shell thickness of CdS, the reaction system demonstrated the maximum activity of CO formation rate and selectivity of 27.6 mmol g−1 h−1 and 95%, respectively. Meantime, the C − C coupling product of 1-phenylethanol also showed the highest formation rate of 26.5 mmol g−1 h−1 with a yield of 74%. In situ ESR measurements supported that the reaction proceeded via the acrinyl radical intermediate (Fig. 11b). Moreover, DFT calculations confirmed that the cleavage of Cα − H bond of 1-phenylethanol to form acrinyl radical owned the lowest bond cleavage energy on CdS surface (Fig. 11c). Recently, Xu's group demonstrated a new avenue for pairing photocatalytic C − C coupling of benzyl alcohol to value-added chemicals with CO2 reduction over cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant functionalized ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation [72]. The conversion of benzyl alcohol could reach as high as 99%, while the total selectivity of C − C coupling products (including hydrobenzoin and benzoin) reached 69%. Thus, the above studies would inspire further development of photocatalytic coupling of alcohols to value-added chemicals integrated with other promising reactions in a cost-effective manner under ambient conditions."
5,Conclusions and outlook,"As a promising strategy of direct conversion of monohydric alcohols into various high-value-added chemicals, in particular diols, photocatalysis has recently aroused great interest from academics to industry. The preferential activation of C − H bond without affecting the hydroxyl group in alcohols by thermocatalysis under harsh reaction conditions is difficult [1–4]. However, photocatalysis has offered a promising way for the activation and selective transformation of monohydric alcohols to high-value-added chemicals integrated with H2 coproduction or CO2 photoreduction under mild conditions. This article highlighted the recent progress of photocatalytic coupling of typical monohydric alcohols, including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, aromatic alcohols, into diols, such as EG, 2,3-BD, pinacol, hydrobenzoin (Fig. 1). The preferential activation of inert sp3 α-C − H bond of methanol without affecting the hydroxyl group, via C − C coupling into EG with high activity and selectivity has been realized. The MoS2 nanofoam modified CdS nanorod catalyst showed high activity for direct photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG with an EG selectivity and yield of 90% and 16%, respectively [20]. Nowadays, only several metal sulfide semiconductors, such as CdS, ZnS, Zn2In2S5, have been developed for photocatalytic coupling of methanol to EG [19–22]. Ethanol and isopropanol have been photocatalytically coupling to 2,3-BD and 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol (pinacol), respectively. The photocatalysts used for these two reactions were similar. Besides metal sulfide semiconductors, TiO2 showed good activity and selectivity in these two reactions [31,37]. Mechanistic studies revealed that the α-C − H bonds of ethanol and isopropanol were preferentially activated by photogenerated holes to form α-hydroxyethyl radicals (•CH(OH)CH3) and 2-hydroxy-2-propyl radicals (•COH(CH3)2) for subsequent C − C coupling to 2,3-BD and pinacol, respectively. Aromatic alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol, have been directly converted to corresponding aromatic pinacol and their derivatives via C − C coupling process under light irradiation. Besides g-C3N4, most of the photocatalysts reported for these reactions were metal sulfide semiconductors, such as ZnIn2S4, Zn x In2S3+ x and CdS [61–66]. CdS quantum dots was a highly efficient photocatalyst. A high formation rate (17.0 mmol g−1 h−1) and selectivity (~99%) of hydrobenzoin have been achieved in photocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol by using CdS quantum dots loaded spherical SiO2 photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation [64]. It has been revealed that benzyl C − H bond of benzyl alcohol is oxidized by the photogenerated hole to acrinyl radical, which could be further C − C coupled to hydrobenzoin. Although much progress has been achieved on photocatalytic transformation of monohydric alcohols to high-value-added chemicals, in particular diols, the development of highly efficient photocatalysts and deep understanding of reaction mechanism are still the keys of future research. Most of the catalysts reported for photocatalytic coupling of alcohols were metal sulfide semiconductors, considering the photocorrosion of metal sulfide, the development of non-sulfide photocatalysts with high stability is important. The more stable non-sulfide photocatalysts, such as metal oxide, metal nitride, are promising candidates for efficient photocatalytic coupling of alcohols to diols and H2. 1,3-propanediol is an very important polymer monomer and also has a wide range of uses. It is very attractive to develop a new photocatalytic route to produce 1,3-propanediol via direct C − C coupling of methanol and ethanol. The key to the selective synthesis of 1,3-propanediol is to construct an efficient photocatalyst for the selective activation of the α-C − H bond or β-C − H of ethanol. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations can be used for a deep understanding of the active sites and reaction mechanisms for C − H activation and C − C coupling. Photocatalytic conversions of alcohols to high-value-added chemicals via C − H activation and C − C coupling processes will become a significant strategy in chemical synthesis in the future."
