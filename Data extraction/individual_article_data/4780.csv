0,Introduction,"The distinctive characteristics of thin films obtained by different methods are the composition of the synthesized film and its stoichiometry, which have a noticeable effect on the properties of the film [1]. Depending on the properties (transparency, conductivity, porosity, etc.), thin films of tin oxide are widely used in various fields, from gas sensors to photocatalysts [2–6]. A rapidly developing field of application is transparent electrodes, for example, in solar cells [7–9]. For use as transparent electrodes, films must have a high transmittance in the optical range and a low resistivity. Synthesized tin oxide films do not always have the necessary conductivity. One of the ways to increase the conductivity of films is hydrogen plasma treatment [10–12]. The bivalent tin oxide formed under the influence of plasma is opaque in the visible region of the spectrum. Its formation leads to a decrease in the transparency of the films. In this regard, an important technical task is to work out the processing modes in order to increase the conductivity of films and preserve transparency. This paper presents the results of the study of the composition, optical and electrical properties of SnO2 films obtained by the modified dipping method. In this work the changes in the properties of SnO2 films during hydrogen plasma treatment also presented."
1,Experiment,"Thin films of tin oxide were produced by Sol-gel method. Five-water crystallohydrate of tin tetrachloride (SnCl4·5H2O) of LLP “Labhimprom”, Kazakhstan, was used as a precursor. The solvent used here was rectified alcohol (97%) “LUX ” production from LLP “Talgar-Alcohol”, Kazakhstan. The films were obtained from the SnCl4/EtOH system with a tin ion concentration of 0.08 mol/l; 0.11 mol/l and 0.14 mol/l. the Films were applied by a modified dipping method. A hydrolysis reaction occurs in the SnCl4/EtOH system: (1) SnC l 4 + 4 H 2 O → Sn ( OH ) 4 + 4 HCl The hydrochloric acid (HCl) released during the reaction (1) suppresses the hydrolysis of SnCl4 and shifts the equilibrium of the system to the left. Under conditions of water scarcity (reaction (1)), complete hydrolysis of tin tetrachloride and formation of tin hydroxide are unlikely to occur. Hydrolysis will go only on the first stage. Complete hydrolysis of tin tetrachloride occurs already on the surface of the substrate under the influence of moisture from the air. Hydrolysis leads to the appearance of reactive OH− groups and subsequent processes of polycondensation and phase formation, that is, the formation of Sol. The transition of Sol into gel, and then into xerogel (gel with more density than usual) occurs on the surface of the substrate. Each layer was air-dried for 15 min, then annealed at 400 °C for 15 min. At this time the decomposition reaction of tin hydroxide to SnO2 and water occurs on the surface of the sample: (2) Sn OH 4 → heating Sn O 2 + 2 H 2 O The water evaporates, leaving a thin layer of xerogel tin dioxide. In total, four layers were applied. The layer thickness was determined by micro-weighting method [13] and was: 127 nm at a tin ion concentration of 0.08 mol/l, 160 nm at 0.11 mol/l and 189 nm at 0.14 mol/l. The plasma was created in a capacitive discharge at a frequency of 27.12 MHz ± 0.6%. Hydrogen plasma treatment was carried out at a gas pressure of 6.5 Pa in the reactor. The power of the RF generator is about 20 Watts. The temperature of the samples during processing did not exceed 100 °C. The processing time was 3 and 6 min. The transmission spectra of the films were measured on two-beam spectrophotometers SF-256 UVI (190–1200 nm) and SF-256 (1100–2500 nm). The composition of the films was studied using an X-ray diffractometer DRON-6. The resistance of the films was determined by the four-probe method."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Spectrophotometric analysis of samples,"3.1 Spectrophotometric analysis of samples After application and treatment with hydrogen plasma transmission spectra were removed. Transmission spectra are shown in Fig. 1 .As can be seen from Fig. 1 on the transmission spectra of films obtained from solutions with a concentration of tin ions 0.12 mol/l, 0.16 mol/l and 0.2 mol/l (Fig. 1 a, b, c curve 1) there are weakly expressed and far-standing interference peaks. The determination of the optical parameters of the layer and its thickness is possible if the transmission spectrum shows clearly pronounced interference peaks. As the film thickness decreases, interference extremes are removed from each other [11]. The film thickness calculated by microweighing [12] is 130 nm, 160 nm, and 200 nm at a film-forming solution concentration of 0.12 mol/l, 0.16 mol/l, and 0.2 mol/l, respectively. The transparency of samples in the visible spectral region is 85–90%. Treatment of thin SnO2 films with hydrogen plasma within three minutes leads to a decrease in transparency by 0.5–2% of samples obtained from solutions with a concentration of tin ions of 0.12 and 0.2 mol/l. the Transparency of the sample obtained from a solution with a concentration of tin ions of 0.16 mol/l decreased by 3% in the visible spectrum. An increase in the duration of hydrogen plasma treatment to 6 min leads to a further decrease in transparency in the visible region of the spectrum. In particular, the transparency of the films at a wavelength of 470 nm. it was 89–87% without treatment, 88–85% after 3 min of treatment in plasma and 86–81% after 6 min of treatment in hydrogen plasma. As can be seen from Fig. 1 (Fig. 1a, b, c curve 2) the transmittance of samples in the visible spectrum is 85–90%. With increasing concentration of the film-forming system, the transmittance at a wavelength of 550 nm decreases from 90% (0.08 mol/l) to 88% (0.14 mol/l). The decrease in the transmittance is due to an increase in the thickness of the film. On the transmission spectra of thin films obtained from a film-forming system with a tin ion concentration of 0.14 mol/l, interference peaks far apart are observed (Fig. 1c, curve 2). On the transmission spectra of films obtained from film-forming systems with a tin ion concentration of 0.08 mol/l and 0.11 mol/l, the spectra partially coincide with the spectrum of the glass substrate. Determination of the thickness of thin optically transparent SnO2 films by the envelope method [14] is possible in the presence of interference peaks. The absence of interference peaks on the transmission spectra of films after treatment with hydrogen plasma (Fig. 1) indicates an increase in surface defects on which electromagnetic radiation is scattered [15,16]. The film thickness, extinction coefficient, film refractive index and absorption coefficient were calculated from the available interference peaks. The results of the calculations are presented in table 1 . The thickness of the film obtained from the SnCl4/EtOH system with a tin ion concentration of 0.14 mol/l calculated by micro-weighing was 189 nm, which differs from the data obtained by the envelope method (Table 1). The difference of 16% is due to the uneven thickness of the film on the surface of the sample. When applied by dipping, the film on the edge of the sample is thicker than in the center. When measuring the transmission spectra, the beam of electromagnetic radiation is directed to the center of the sample, where the thickness is less. As can be seen from Table 1, after treatment with hydrogen plasma for three minutes, the thickness of the film increased, presumably due to a decrease in density. There was an increase in the absorption coefficient. As noted earlier [17–19], hydrogen, being a reducing agent and being in a chemically active (ionized) state, restores a part of SnO2 molecules to SnO. (3) Sn O 2 + 4 H + → SnO + 2 H 2 O The resulting reaction tin (II) oxide (SnO) has a black-blue or brownish-black color. The formation of SnO molecules leads to an increase in the absorption coefficient. The greatest changes in the transmittance are observed in the visible region of the spectrum, in green light. Table 2 shows the values of the transmittance of thin films SnO2 at a wavelength of 550 nm (green light). Table 2 shows that the transmittance of films obtained from the SnCl4/EtOH system with a tin ion concentration of 0.08 and 0.14 mol/l when treated in hydrogen plasma for three minutes varies within the measurement accuracy of ± 1%. Increasing the processing time to six minutes, leads to a reduction in the transmittance to 88% for films obtained from the film-forming system with a concentration of tin ions of 0.08 mol/l. to 85% - at 0.11 mol/l and 84% at 0.14 mol/l. The decrease in the transmittance can be caused both by the formation of tin (II) oxide, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation in the visible region of the spectrum, and by the scattering of electromagnetic radiation from increased surface irregularities [10,20,21]. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to determine the reasons for the decrease in transmittance."
4,Diffraction analysis.,"3.2 Diffraction analysis. The original signal has a high noise level. Using the method of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio [22,23], the following data were obtained and analyzed. Fig. 2 shows the results of signal isolation for SnO2 films after receiving. From Fig. 2 it is seen that the films consist of crystallites of SnO2. Reflections from the SnO2 planes with Miller indices (1 0 1), (2 0 0) and (2 1 1) are observed. Fig. 3 shows the results of signal isolation for SnO2 films after three-minutes plasma treatment. Fig. 3 shows that after treatment with hydrogen plasma for three minutes there was a reflection from the SnO2 plane with Miller indices (1 1 0). This is due to the formation of SnO2 crystallites by heating the sample to 100 °C during plasma treatment. Reflections from crystallographic planes of other tin oxides (SnO and Sn2O3) were not detected. The observed increase in the absorption coefficient (Table 1) is associated with the formation of amorphous SnO clusters. There is an increase in the intensity of reflection from the SnO2 planes with Miller indices (1 0 1) for samples obtained from systems with a concentration of 0.11 mol/l (Fig. 2b and 3b). In [24] it is indicated that the intensity of SnO2 (1 0 1) planes should decrease after increasing the treatment time with hydrogen plasma. For the correct interpretation of this phenomenon, additional research is needed. Fig. 4 shows the results of signal isolation for SnO2 films after plasma treatment for six minutes. Fig. 4 shows that after treatment with hydrogen plasma for six minutes there were peaks of reflection of x-ray radiation from Sn2O3 (plane with Miller indices (0 2 1)) and SnO (plane with Miller indices (1 0 1)). On the X-ray of films obtained from the SnCl4/EtOH film-forming system with a tin ion concentration of 0.08 mol/l (Fig. 4a), the peaks of Sn2O3 and SnO are clearly visible. As the concentration of the film-forming system increases (Fig. 4b), the Sn2O3 and SnO peaks are broad and combined with the SnO2 peak (1 1 0). On the X-ray of films obtained from the film-forming system with a tin ion concentration of 0.14 mol/l, (Fig. 4c) peaks from Sn2O3 and SnO are not observed."
5,The surface resistance of the samples,"3.3 The surface resistance of the samples Pure stoichiometric tin dioxide (SnO2) is a dielectric. The conductivity of tin dioxide films is associated with the presence of intrinsic defects-oxygen vacancies that form small donor levels. The energy of formation of oxygen vacancies depends on the position of the Fermi level. When the Fermi level is near the ceiling of the valence band, the energy of oxygen vacancy formation is negative and is on the order of −0.3 eV. This leads to spontaneous generation of defects [15]. Therefore, pure, but not stoichiometric, tin dioxide (SnO2-x) is an n-type semiconductor. The resistance of the films was determined by 10 measurements at different sites of the samples. The Student coefficient for 10 measurements with a reliability of 0.95 = 2.262. The error was calculated by the formula: Δ A ¯ = t γ , n - 1 ∑ i - = 1 n A i - A ¯ 2 n - 1 n where, Δ A - is the absolute error of measurements, tγ,n- 1 is the Student's coefficient, Ai is the value of the i - th measurement, A - is the arithmetic mean, n is the number of measurements.y. Table 3 shows the average values of the resistance of the studied films. As can be seen from Table 3, the resistance of films without treatment depends on the concentration of the film-forming system. Films obtained from SnCl4/EtOH systems with a lower concentration have a lower thickness. It leads to an increase in the resistance of the sample. Three-minute treatment with hydrogen plasma resulted in a decrease in the resistance of the samples, approximately 1.5 times, due to an increase in oxygen vacancies under the influence of hydrogen plasma. In this case, the above reaction (3) is not complete and will have the form: (4) sn O 2 + 2 x H + → Sn O 2 - x + x H 2 O Thus, additional formation of oxygen vacancies occurs. Six-minute treatment in hydrogen plasma leads to a further decrease in resistance (Table 3). However, along with the decrease in the resistance is reduced and the absorption coefficient. The using of a longer treatment with hydrogen plasma (5,10,15,20 min) [25,26] leads to a decrease in the transmittance from 3% to 15% for films obtained by the Sol-gel method. The most suitable conditions for obtaining transparent conductive coatings is the using of a film-forming system SnCl4/EtOH with a tin ion concentration of 0.14 mol/l. Treatment for three minutes with a glow discharge plasma in a hydrogen atmosphere reduces the resistance of these films, without reducing the transparency. These conditions make it possible to obtain films with a transmittance of 88–87% and a resistance of 1.00 ± 0.22 MΩ."
6,Conclusion,"SnO2 films were obtained from the SnCl4/EtOH system with a tin ion concentration of 0.08 mol/l, 0.11 mol/l and 0.14 mol/l. The dependence of the film transmittance on the tin ion concentration in the SnCl4/EtOH system was observed. Increasing the concentration leads to a decrease in the transmittance. Three-minute hydrogen plasma treatment changes the transmittance of films obtained from a system with a tin ion concentration of 0.08 mol/l and 0.14 mol/l within the measurement accuracy. Increasing the processing time to six minutes, leads to a decrease in the transmittance of these films by 3–4%. This is due to the formation of Sn2O3 and SnO. The crystal structure of Sn2O3 and SnO is formed in films obtained from SnCl4/EtOH systems with a lower concentration of tin ions. In films obtained from SnCl4/EtOH systems with a tin ion concentration of 0.14 mol/l, after treatment for six minutes in hydrogen plasma, no crystal phases of Sn2O3 and SnO were detected. Treatment of hydrogen plasma led to the decrease of the resistance of the samples. To obtain transparent coatings, the using of a film-forming system SnCl4/EtOH with a tin ion concentration of 0.14 mol/l and treatment for three minutes with a glow discharge plasma in a hydrogen atmosphere (to reduce resistance) are the most suitable conditions."
