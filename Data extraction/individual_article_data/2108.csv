0,Introduction,"Propylene oxide (PO) is an industrially important chemical feedstock and widely used in the synthesis of propylene glycols, polyurethane and polyether polyols [1]. In addition to polypropylene and acrylonitrile, PO is the third derivative of propylene. Currently, PO is mainly produced by multiple reaction steps in liquid phase such as chlorohydrin process (using hazardous chlorine) and hydroperoxide process (using expensive hydroperoxides) [2–4]. These synthesis routes in liquid phase are not satisfied with the requirement of cleaner production. Therefore, developing a simple and green route for propylene epoxidation with molecular oxygen is promising for PO production in the industry. The gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with O2 and H2 has been studied for two decades and the catalysts used have developed from Au/Ti-based catalysts to bimetallic catalysts [5–8]. In respect of propylene, there exist three reactions in this route, i.e., propylene epoxidation (C3H6+ O2+ H2→ PO+ H2O), propylene hydrogenation (C3H6+ H2→ C3H8) and propylene combustion (2C3H6+ 9O2→ 6CO2+ 6H2O). Because the propylene combustion needs much higher temperature than 200 °C, it can be ignored at a lower reaction temperature (≤200 °C). Therefore, we mainly consider the propylene epoxidation and hydrogenation reactions, and CO2 generation was not accounted. For Au/Ti-based catalysts, Qi et al. pointed out that the propylene hydrogenation prevailed over Au clusters smaller than 2.0 nm (in the absence of alkalis) and over Au nanoparticles greater than 5.0 nm [9]. Oyama et al. found that the cyanide treatment of Au/TS-1 could generate Au(+1) nanoparticles and the treated catalyst exhibited high selectivity toward propylene hydrogenation [10]. It seems that Au(0) nanoparticles in the range of 2.0–5.0 nm contributes to the propylene epoxidation over Au/TS-1 catalysts. Recently, bimetallic catalysts have become a research hotspot in the field of gas-phase epoxidation of propylene due to their unique catalytic properties. A variety of bimetallic catalysts have been developed so far [7,8,11–21]. For example, Feng et al. designed the Au-Ag/TS-1-B (with blocked pore) and the catalyst with Ag/Au molar ratio of 0.1 showed a stable PO formation rate of 174–233 gPO h−1 gAu −1 at 200 °C [7]. The gold atom efficiency (i.e., PO formation rate per gram of gold) seems to be improved by the addition of a second metal into Au catalyst. Our previous work demonstrated that the Au-Pd/TS-1 with Pd/Au molar ratio of 0.5 exhibited the PO formation rate as high as ∼1000 gPO h−1 gAu −1 at 200 °C [21]. However, the unwanted propylene hydrogenation might be induced over bimetallic catalysts simultaneously. Zwijnenburg et al. reported that Au-Pt/TiO2-SiO2 mainly showed propylene epoxidation performance with PO yield of ∼1.0% and propane yield of ∼0.1% at 100 °C. While Au-Pd/TiO2-SiO2 tended to exhibit propylene hydrogenation performance with propane yield of ∼10% and PO yield of <0.01% at 100 °C [12]. Obviously, for the Au-Pd supported catalysts (e.g., Au-Pd/TiO2-SiO2 and Au-Pd/TS-1), both propylene epoxidation and propylene hydrogenation should be taken into consideration. These two reactions have been reported to be competitive over nano-gold catalysts for gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with O2 and H2 [9]. Herein, we investigated the reactions occur on Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts with Au-Pd nanoparticles ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 nm, which were the same as those used in our previous work [8,21]. To observe the pure propylene hydrogenation clearly, oxygen was removed from the reactants that consisted of H2: O2: C3H6: N2 = 1: 1: 1: 7 for propylene epoxidation over Au-Pd/TS-1. Then the effect of O2 on propylene hydrogenation was explored and the relationship between propylene hydrogenation and epoxidation was further discussed. Given that the reactions were complex over Au-Pd/TS-1, the active sites were investigated by designing four catalysts. In addition, a four-stage model was proposed for the first time. The effect of carbon monoxide (CO) addition was also demonstrated over Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts besides Au/Ti-SiO2 catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Au-Pd/TS-1,"2.1 Synthesis of Au-Pd/TS-1 TS-1 support was synthesized by the hydrothermal synthesis method reported previously [22,23]. Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts was prepared by the alcohol reduction-mediated supported method as described in our previous paper [8,21]. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, AR) was used as a protector for the dispersion of nanoparticles. First, Pd nanoparticles were reduced by ethylene glycol (EG, AR). Then, Au-Pd nanoparticles were prepared by the replacement reaction between Pd nanoparticles and Au3+. Finally, four Au-Pd/TS-1 catalysts with different Pd/Au molar ratios were prepared by adjusting the amount of palladium source, as listed in Table S1. According to the Pd/Au molar ratio, these catalysts are denoted as Au1Pd0.8/TS-1, Au1Pd0.6/TS-1, Au1Pd0.5/TS-1 and Au1Pd0.3/TS-1, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The bulk structure of TS-1 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Beijing Purkinje General) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and the local environment of titanium in TS-1 was evaluated by Ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis, Evolution 220) with BaSO4 as the reference. The great relative intensities of crystal planes of (101) and (501) in Fig. S1 shows that the synthesized TS-1 is a suitable support for propylene epoxidation [24]. Au-Pd nanoparticles was observed by a 300 kV field emission high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin) equipped with energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Genesis 60S). As can be seen from Fig. S2, Pd and Au elements are detected simultaneously in the obvious black particle on TS-1 (illustrated by Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 as an example), agreeing with the literature [25]. The Au-Pd alloy structure and its geometric morphology (i.e., cuboctahedron) have been confirmed by HRTEM images and in-situ CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) in our previous work [8,21]. Fig. S3 shows the HRTEM image of Au1Pd0.8/TS-1, confirming the cuboctahedron structure of Au-Pd alloy nanoparticles. Because the average sizes of bimetallic nanoparticles were in the range of 2.0–5.0 nm [8], these Au-Pd alloy nanoparticles were supported on the external surfaces of TS-1. The Pd and Au loadings were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; Varian ICP 720). The products of reaction over Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS; Finnigan Trace DSQ GC/MS) with helium (He, 99.999%) as the carrier gas. The generated OOH species during the reaction was detected by in-situ DRIFTS, which was performed on a Nicolet IS10 spectrometer equipped with a liquid-N2-cooled high-sensitivity MCT-A detector. The reactants were introduced into the high temperature reaction chamber (Harrick; HVC-DRP-5), and the spectra began to be recorded immediately when the sample was heated to the target temperature. The carbonaceous deposits were demonstrated by the differential FTIR spectra and thermogravimetric analysis (TG; TA Instruments SDT Q600). The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out on an automated chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics; AutoChem II 2920). The sample was purged with 50 mL min−1 He at 300 °C for 30 min, then decreased to 100 °C and followed purged with 50 mL min−1 10 vol% H2/Argon for 30 min. Afterwards, the sample was heated from 100 to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. For H2-TPR with O2 treatment, the sample was pretreated with 30 mL min−1 2 vol% O2/Argon at 100 °C for 30 min before H2 purge."
4,Catalytic testing,"2.3 Catalytic testing The gas-phase epoxidation of propylene was tested in a fixed-bed reactor. The reactant mixture, which consisted of C3H6: H2: N2: air = 3.5: 3.5: 10.5: 17.5 mL min−1, flowed through 0.15 g of Au-Pd/TS-1 (60–80 mesh) under atmospheric pressure. The space velocity was calculated to be 14,000 mL h−1 gcat −1. The catalyst was heated from room temperature to the reaction temperature at a rate of ∼1 °C min−1. The effluents were measured online by a gas chromatography (GC; SP-3420A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD; Chromsorb 102 packed column) and a flame ionization detector (FID; KB-wax capillary column). CO2 was not accounted for the products. Before GC detection, the reactants had enough time (more than 1 h) to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Results showed that there was almost no delay for the detection of PO. Considering that the GC peaks of propylene and propane are difficult to separate with the used KB-wax capillary column, the proportion of propylene and propane were roughly estimated according to their standard curves, where the linear correlation coefficients were 0.9999 and 0.9992, respectively. Blank test indicated that no PO was generated in the blank reactor. Catalytic performances were defined as follow: PO selectivity = moles of PO/ moles of C3 oxidation converted C3H6 conversion = moles of C3H6 converted to oxidation products/ moles of C3H6 in the feed H2 conversion = moles of H2 converted/ moles of H2 in the feed H2 efficiency = moles of PO/ moles of H2 converted to oxidation products PO (or C3H8) yield = moles of PO (or C3H8)/ moles of products"
5,Results and discussions,
6,Effect of O2 on propylene hydrogenation,"3.1 Effect of O2 on propylene hydrogenation Illustrated by Au1Pd0.6/TS-1 as an example, the pure hydrogenation of C3H6 was investigated. That is, O2 was eliminated and the reactant mixture was consisted of C3H6: H2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 28.0 mL min−1. Fig. 1 shows the C3H8 yields of Au1Pd0.6/TS-1 at 100 and 200 °C, respectively, without O2. The activity of propylene hydrogenation seems low at 100 °C within 0-5th h. When the reaction temperature increased to 200 °C, the average of C3H8 yield in this period (7-11th h) is measured to be ∼14%. After a small amount of O2 was introduced into the above system (i.e., C3H6: H2: O2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 3.5: 24.5 mL min−1), the corresponding C3H8 yield at 200 °C increases significantly to ∼70% in 12-17th h. At the same time, PO is produced and its yield is above 0.7%. Compared to the C3H8 yield of ∼14% without O2 at 200 °C, the introduction of O2 indeed significantly promotes the rate of hydrogenation at 200 °C, which is consistent with the literature [9]. The effect of O2 concentration was further investigated by introducing different O2 flow rates at the higher reaction temperature of 200 °C. During this period, the total flow rate remained at 35 mL min−1. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding C3H8 and PO yields of Au1Pd0.6/TS-1. As can be seen, the hydrogenation of C3H6 occurs slowly without O2 (i.e., 0% of O2 concentration; C3H6: H2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 28.0 mL min−1). The corresponding C3H8 yield of Au1Pd0.6/TS-1 is below 15%. However, when 2% of O2 concentration was introduced into the system (i.e., C3H6: H2: O2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 0.7: 27.3 mL min−1), the C3H8 yield increases significantly to ∼60% and the propylene epoxidation occurs. With an increase in O2 concentration from 2% to 10%, the change in C3H8 yield is relatively small, only increasing by ∼10%. The PO yield is measured to be ∼0.3% with 2% O2 and ∼0.6% with 4% O2. When O2 concentration changes from 6% to 10%, the PO yield remains at ∼0.7%. It can be seen that the effect of O2 concentration is less important than that of the presence or absence of O2 on propylene hydrogenation. The hydrogenation rate can be dramatically improved by introducing a small amount of O2 into the C3H6/H2 system at 200 °C. As known to all, a great energy of 436 kJ mol−1 is needed to dissociate H2 in the hydrogenation [26], but the activation of H2 with O2 only needs lower energy of 231 kJ mol−1, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The process is accompanied by the formation of hydroperoxyl (OOH) species. Our previous work has demonstrated that in-situ DRIFTS measurement could detect OOH species during propylene epoxidation [8]. Fig. S4 provides the in-situ DRIFT spectra (0−10 min) of Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 at 200 °C with the reactant mixture consisted of C3H6: H2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 28.0 mL min-1 and C3H6: H2: O2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 3.5: 24.5 mL min−1. Herein, the spectra at 5th min of Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 in. not in O2 atmosphere are compared and shown in Fig. 3(b). As can be seen from the inset figures, the absorption bands at 873 and 3400 cm−1 correspond to the OOH species [8,27], indicating that the introduction of O2 plays an important role in activating H2. The formation of OOH species is also confirmed by ex-situ Raman techniques (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Aramis; 532 nm line). As shown in Fig. S5, there is a weak peak in the region of 810−860 cm−1 for Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 catalyst pretreated at 200 °C for 2 h with the reactant mixture consisted of C3H6: H2: O2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 3.5: 24.5 mL min−1. While no peak is observed on the catalyst pretreated at 200 °C for 2 h with the reactant mixture consisted of C3H6: H2: N2 = 3.5: 3.5: 28.0 mL min−1. According to the literature, the peak at 837 cm−1 is assigned to the OO stretching mode in the Ti−OOH species [28]. Thus, OOH species is indeed generated in the presence of H2 and O2. To further investigate the effect of O2 on H2 dissociation, H2-TPR with/without O2 treatment was carried out on Au-Pd/TS-1 (illustrated by Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 as an example). Fig. 3(c) shows the H2-TPR plots of pure TS-1 and Au1Pd0.8/TS-1. For TS-1, there is no obvious reduction peak in the range of 100−600 °C, indicating that TS-1 framework is stable in H2 atmosphere. However, the reduction performance for Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 is observed. It can be seen that only one H2 reduction peak exists whether Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 was pretreated with O2 or not. This reduction peak is due to the reduction of Ti(IV) to Ti(III), resulting from H-spillover process over Pd-containing catalysts such as Au-Pd/TS-1 [8]. Xu et al. also reported that the Ti4+ could be reduced to Ti3+ by the dissociative hydrogen chemisorbed on Pd/TiO2 [29]. The H2 reduction peak of Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 with O2 treatment is located at ∼375 °C, which is a little lower than ∼385 °C without O2 treatment. It means that the H-spillover process over Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 can be enhanced via O2 treatment. Obviously, the incorporation of O2 contributes to H2 disassociation over Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts. On the other hand, the formed OOH species was reported to accelerate H2 dissociation in turn [30]. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the activation of H2 with OOH needs much lower energy of 66 kJ mol−1, as compared to 436 and 231 kJ mol−1. To sum up, the introduction of O2 promotes H2 disassociation and enhances the H-spillover process, thus improving the rate of propylene hydrogenation markedly. The formed OOH species (regarded as the key to oxidize C3H6 to PO [31]) also contributes to propylene epoxidation. As presented in Fig. 1, PO is generated after the introduction of O2 into the C3H6/H2 system."
7,Hydrogenation and epoxidation,"3.2 Hydrogenation and epoxidation Fig. 4 (a) describes the propylene hydrogenation and epoxidation over Au-Pd/TS-1 with Au-Pd nanoparticles located on the external surfaces of TS-1. As far as we are concerned, the propylene hydrogenation preferentially occurs at Pd sites, while the propylene epoxidation mainly occurs at Au-Ti sites [1,32,33]. Considering that Pd catalyst is reported to exhibit a high selectivity towards the direct synthesis of H2O2 from O2 and H2 [34–37], the propylene epoxidation may also occur at Pd-Ti sites where Pd sites are close to the Ti sites. The H2O2 produced on Pd sites needs to be transferred to the adjacent Ti sites, then the formed Ti−OOH will epoxidize propylene. If the distance between Pd and Ti is too great, H2O2 will decompose to H2O during the transfer process [38]. The number of Ti sites inside nanopores is much greater than that on the external surfaces (supposing that Ti species distributes uniformly), thus the Au-Pd nanoparticles should be confined inside the nanoporous channels of TS-1 in our future study. The reactivity of Au-Pd nanoparticles smaller than 1.0 nm also needs to be investigated. For Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts, there exist four sites of Au-Ti, Au-Si, Pd-Ti and Pd-Si sites. Thus, four catalysts (denoted as Au/TS-1-DP, Au/S-1-DP, Pd/TS-1-DP and Pd/S-1-DP) were prepared by the deposition precipitation (DP) method to demonstrate the active sites. The catalyst prepared by the DP method generally exhibits higher activity, which is helpful for analysis. Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the epoxidation and hydrogenation activities of above four catalysts at 200 °C, respectively. It can be seen that the PO formation rate of Au/TS-1-DP is much higher than those of the other three catalysts. Au/S-1-DP and Pd/S-1-DP hardly show epoxidation activities. Pd/TS-1-DP and Pd/S-1-DP mainly exhibit hydrogenation activities. It is concluded that Au-Ti sites contribute to propylene epoxidation and Pd species plays a major role in propylene hydrogenation. The PO formation rate of Pd/TS-1-DP at 200 °C indicates that the Pd-Ti sites are also active for propylene epoxidation. However, for Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts, only a few of Pd species nears Ti sites because that the Si/Ti molar ratio of synthesized TS-1 is ∼109. A large amount of Pd species anchors at Si sites [39,40], which is beneficial to hydrogenate C3H6. The Au species is suggested to anchor at Ti sites [41–43], thus the Au-Ti sites promote the synthesis of PO from O2, H2 and C3H6. Given that there exists H-spillover process over Au-Pd/TS-1, the chemisorbed hydrogen molecules dissociate at Pd sites and generate highly reactive hydrogen species, which could spill over to Au sites and react with the adsorbed O2 to form OOH species [8]. The OOH species could be transferred to the adjacent Ti sites for epoxidizing propylene, or directly combine with C3H6 to generates C3H8, as illustrated in Fig. S6. We have discussed the propylene epoxidation over Au-Pd/TS-1 at 200 °C previously [8,21]. Combined with the finding that Au-Pd/TiO2-SiO2 could exhibit poor activity at 100 °C [12], the catalytic performance of Au-Pd/TS-1 at 100 °C was explored in the work. Fig. 5 shows PO formation rate, PO selectivity, C3H6 conversion, H2 conversion and H2 efficiency vs. time-on-stream in hours at 100 °C for Au-Pd/TS-1. It should be pointed out that all the data were measured until the catalysts deactivated. Obviously, all the curves in Fig. 5 exhibit a similar trend, which could be divided into four stages, denoted as stages I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the stage I, H2 conversion increases significantly but H2 efficiency increases a little, as shown in Fig. 5(b1-b4). While the PO formation rate is low in Fig. 5(a1-a4). It can be inferred that a large amount of H2 is consumed by side reactions except the propylene epoxidation. The product of propylene hydrogenation can be verified by GC–MS analysis. Given that the stage I of Au1Pd0.8/TS-1, Au1Pd0.6/TS-1, Au1Pd0.5/TS-1 and Au1Pd0.3/TS-1 lasted for 0.7, 1.5, 2.0 and 6.5 h, respectively, the effluents of Au1Pd0.5/TS-1 at 100 °C with C3H6: H2: O2: N2 = 1: 1: 1: 7 during the first 1−2 h were collected and tested, as shown in Fig. 6 (a). The ion peaks located at mass-charge ratio (m/z) = 41.94, 40.92 and 26.94 imply the presence of C3H6. The ion peaks at m/z = 43.96, 42.94 and 28.93 may result from C3H8. H2O displays a molecular ion peak at m/z = 18.02. To further prove it, the reactant mixture was changed to be consisted of H2: C3H6: N2 = 1: 1: 8 to exclude the propylene oxidation by the elimination of O2. The corresponding MS spectrum is presented in Fig. 6(b). As can be seen, there are also the ion peaks at m/z = 43.93, 43.00 and 28.93, indicating the presence of C3H8. No H2O is detected without O2. Therefore, under the standard reaction conditions, C3H8 is indeed generated over Au-Pd/TS-1 and propylene hydrogenation preferentially occurs in the stage I. The decrease of PO selectivity is mainly due to the generation of acetone, which is also the main by-product over Au-Pd/TS-1 at 200 °C [8]. Notably, the different times in the stage I are related to the Pd/Au molar ratio instead of the effect of reactants adsorption. If it is a result of adsorption phenomena, the elapsed times in the stage I for Au-Pd/TS-1 with different Pd/Au molar ratios should be the same because the mass of catalysts as well as the space velocity were the same. As the Pd/Au molar ratio decreases from 0.8 to 0.3, the times in the stage I increases from 0.7 to 6.5 h, indicating that propylene hydrogenation is relevant to Pd addition. In the stage II, PO formation rate and PO selectivity increase simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 5(a1-a4). From Fig. 5(b1-b4), H2 conversion and H2 efficiency also increase. Thus, the epoxidation of C3H6 occupies a dominant position. In the stage III, the catalytic performance of Au-Pd/TS-1 is almost in a steady state and PO formation rate hardly changes. It is suggested that the hydrogenation and epoxidation of C3H6 achieve a balance. In the stage IV, both PO formation rate [see Fig. 5(a1-a4)] and H2 conversion [see Fig. 5(b1-b4)] decrease. It seems that Au-Pd/TS-1 deactivates gradually, resulting from the effect of carbon deposits or other reasons such as Au-Pd nanoparticles agglomeration. As illustrated by the example of Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 (because this Au-Pd/TS-1 deactivated after being tested at 100 °C for 6 h), the carbonaceous deposits are detected on the spent Au1Pd0.8/TS-1, as presented in Fig. S7. Results of HRTEM in Fig. S8 suggest that the size of Au-Pd nanoparticles on the deactivated Au1Pd0.8/TS-1 increases to ∼4.1 nm from the initial ∼2.0 nm. Based on the above analysis, we propose a four-stage model of catalytic performance for gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with O2 and H2 over Au-Pd/TS-1. Fig. 7 shows the C3H8 and PO yields of Au-Pd/TS-1 at 100 °C, which demonstrates the above four stages directly. It can be seen that for all the Au-Pd/TS-1 catalysts, the rate of propylene hydrogenation in the initial stage is much higher than that of propylene epoxidation. As a result, the hydrogenation of C3H6 dominates in the stage I. In the second stage, the rate of propylene hydrogenation drops more or less, but that of propylene epoxidation continues to increase. It can be concluded that the epoxidation of C3H6 occurs markedly in the stage II. In the stage III, the rates of propylene hydrogenation and epoxidation achieve a competitive balance. In the stage IV, these two rates decrease as a result of catalyst deactivation. Therefore, Au-Pd/TS-1 exhibits a typical four-stage catalytic performance at 100 °C, resulting from the competitive reaction between propylene hydrogenation and epoxidation. To prove that the phenomenon exists for all Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts, we prepared another Au-Pd/TS-1 catalyst with higher Pd/Au molar ratio (denoted as Au1Pd3.5/TS-1) using the alcohol reduction-mediated supported method. Fig. S9 shows the corresponding catalytic performance at 100 °C. There also exists a typical four-stage phenomenon for Au1Pd3.5/TS-1. To sum up, it is rational to propose the four-stage model of catalytic performance for gas-phase epoxidation of propylene over the whole Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts at 100 °C. When the experiment was performed at the higher temperature of 200 °C, the first two stages (i.e., the stages I and II) cannot be observed, as shown in Fig. S10. This might be because the balance between hydrogenation and epoxidation of C3H6 is achieved so quickly at 200 °C. The stage III is observed at first and after a period of time, the catalyst deactivates in the stage IV. That is the reason why we only investigated the propylene epoxidation activity of Au-Pd/TS-1 at 200 °C in our previous research [8]. For Au/TS-1 and Pd/TS-1 prepared by the same alcohol reduction-mediated supported method, there is no catalytic activity for Au/TS-1 at 100 °C, and no four stages can be observed over Pd/TS-1 at 100 °C (see Fig. S11). Hence, the four-stage phenomenon might be special to bimetallic catalysts such as Au-Pd/TS-1. This four-stage model well reveals the competition between propylene epoxidation and hydrogenation. According to this four-stage model, we proposed the potential guideline for designing bimetallic catalysts. For propylene epoxidation, the Stage I should be avoided as much as possible. While for propylene hydrogenation, the Stage II is not required. Specifically, for Au-Pd/TS-1 used in propylene epoxidation at 100 °C, the Pd/Au molar ratio could be increased appropriately (maybe increasing to ∼1, i.e., Au1Pd1/TS-1). In this case, the catalyst would exhibit better performance because it is quick to reach a balance between propylene hydrogenation and epoxidation. To verify the above presumption, we further investigate the effect of Pd/Au molar ratio on epoxidation activity of Au-Pd/TS-1 at 100 °C, as shown in Fig. S12. It can be seen that Au0.5Pd0.5/TS-1, namely Au1Pd1/TS-1, exhibits the highest PO formation rate among Au-Pd/TS-1 with different Pd/Au molar ratios. It should be noted that the sum of Au and Pd loadings for all bimetallic catalysts are almost the same. Therefore, the optimal Pd/Au ratio for propylene epoxidation at 100 °C is indeed 1. The positive effect of Pd addition is due to the synergistic enhancement over Au-Pd/TS-1 [8], while the PO formation rate decreases as the Pd/Au molar ratio is greater than 1."
8,Effect of CO addition,"3.3 Effect of CO addition Given that the propylene epoxidation is the wanted reaction, the presence of O2 is essential and the pronounced propylene hydrogenation seems unavoidable over Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts. Nijhuis et al. pointed out that the introduction of a small amount of CO into the epoxidation system could completely inhibit the propylene hydrogenation over Au/Ti-SiO2 [44]. Herein, we tried to introduce 0.5 vol% CO into the reactants consisted of C3H6: H2: N2: air = 3.5: 3.5: 10.5: 17.5 mL min−1 to switch off propylene hydrogenation over Au-Pd/TS-1. Illustrated by Au1Pd0.6/TS-1 as an example, Fig. 8 shows the C3H8 and PO yields of Au-Pd/TS-1 at 100 °C without/with CO addition. The initial activity is obtained from the stage III (steady stage) in the four-stage model, namely, the reaction time t = 0 h in Fig. 8 corresponds to t = 6th h in Fig. 5(a2)(b2). After being tested at 100 °C for 4 h, approximately 0.5 vol% CO was introduced into the reaction system and the total flow rate remained at 35 mL min−1. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the C3H8 yield decreases significantly under the effect of CO, agreeing with Nijhuis’s work [44]. However, the propylene hydrogenation is only suppressed to a certain extent instead of completely. This might be because CO competitively adsorbs on Au sites [44] and then inhibits the H-spillover on Au-Pd nanoparticles, resulting in the decrease of propylene hydrogenation. Simultaneously, the epoxidation rate increases a little after CO introduction. It was reported that the reaction mechanism involving CO as a co-reactant was different from that involving H2 as a co-reactant (surface oxygen vacancies for CO/O2/C3H6 system vs. OOH species for H2/O2/C3H6 system) [31,45]. Thus, the increase of propylene epoxidation is possible in the simultaneous presence of CO and H2. The corresponding mechanism of CO/H2/O2/C3H6 system might be more complex and we will do further research in our next work. In summary, the introduction of 0.5 vol% CO could abate propylene hydrogenation and promote propylene epoxidation over Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts."
9,Conclusions,"Au-Pd/TS-1 bimetallic catalysts prepared by the alcohol reduction-mediated supported method showed activity for gas-phase epoxidation of propylene with O2 and H2. When the reaction was performed at 100 °C, the catalytic performance of Au-Pd/TS-1 exhibited an interesting phenomenon. It can be divided into four stages, denoted as stages I, II, III and IV. In the stage I, propylene hydrogenation dominants and then the epoxidation dominants in the stage II. Afterwards, the two reactions achieve a balance in the stage III and the activity decreases gradually in the stage IV. The four-stage model is proposed for the first time, which reveals the competition between propylene hydrogenation and epoxidation. The insights reported here may guide us to understand the reaction mechanism of propylene epoxidation over Au-Pd/TS-1. The role of Au sites mainly contributes to the epoxidation of propylene and that of Pd sites is primarily responsible for the hydrogenation of propylene. Additionally, it is demonstrated that O2 could enhance the activity of Au-Pd/TS-1 for propylene hydrogenation, while the introduction of CO suppresses the hydrogenation. For propylene, the degree of epoxidation and hydrogenation is thus regulated by tuning the composition of reactant mixture."
