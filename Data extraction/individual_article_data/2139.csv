0,Introduction,"Biofuels such as biohydrogen and bioethanol are promising CO2 neutral fuels contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions as they are derived from renewable energy sources such as organic wastes [1]. Biohydrogen is efficient and environmentally friendly, since it has a high energy content, producing water as the sole end product after combustion [2]. As an attractive alternative fuel, bioethanol has already been widely used for road vehicles and for other applications due to the possibility of domestic production which can secure energy supply [3]. Biological hydrogen and ethanol production are widely studied processes [2–4]. Hemoheterotrophic (“dark”) fermentation was widely studied for biohydrogen and bioethanol generation [5–7]. More specifically, thermophilic and extreme-thermophilic dark fermentation have been drawing more interest for hydrogen and ethanol production [8–15], compared to mesophilic fermentation: higher yields due to thermodynamic advantages, better pathogenic destruction, limited growth of hydrogen consumers (e.g. methanogens and homoacetogens). Furthermore, certain thermophilic bacteria have the ability to produce ethanol simultaneously with hydrogen [5,14,15]. However, simultaneous biohydrogen and bioethanol production has scarcely been investigated, with only few studies being published so far [5,8]. Although formation of alcohols (e.g. ethanol) that would consume free electrons from NADH oxidation is usually unfavorable for hydrogen production [5], it is feasible to allow a balanced simultaneous production of both gaseous and liquid energy carriers for optimal total energy gain. The major advantage of this process is that, since hydrogen and ethanol are present in different phases, separation of the two biofuels would be relatively easy. Co-production of the two fuels with possibility of alteration of the main product has obvious advantages, as such a production system could utilize different market demands. A metabolic pathway resulting in simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production from glucose has been previously proposed [16], which results in theoretical production of 2mol H2 and 1mol ethanol (Eq. (1)). (1) C6H12O6 +H2O→2H2 +CH3CH2OH+CH3COOH+2CO2 A number of factors are crucial for the dark fermentation process. Substrate concentration and loading rate were shown to affect the hydrogen and ethanol yields during fermentation of glucose. High substrate loading rate may cause inhibition and decrease hydrogen production [15,33]. pH is very important for the activity of functional enzymes, and therefore pH buffers like phosphate or carbonate are often used for maintaining the pH at a certain level. Nutrients such as nitrogen (peptone and yeast extract), phosphorus, vitamins and mineral salts were shown to be essential for the synthesis of macro- and micro-molecules in the cells [18]. Despite a great research interest in extreme-thermophilic dark fermentation, most studies have only focused on the effect of individual factors (pH, HRT, ethanol tolerance) on either bioethanol [15,33] or biohydrogen production [14,16–18]. No information is currently available regarding the effect of pH and nutrients on simultaneous extreme-thermophilic biohydrogen and bioethanol production. In addition, knowledge of the microbial community structure is critical for optimizing the microbial populations and improving hydrogen and ethanol production by mixed culture fermentation. Therefore, the aim of the study was to screen a number of variables to identify those that significantly affect the simultaneous biohydrogen and bioethanol production. Effect of those variables on bacterial community structure was also studied."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula and experimental set-up,"2.1 Inocula and experimental set-up The initial inoculum was taken from a hydrogen fermentation reactor that was operated at 70°C [19] with glucose and synthetic basic anaerobic medium (BA medium) as previously described [20]. The culture was transferred to vials containing BA medium with 2g glucose/L. Then the vials were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and closed with aluminum caps. The headspace was sparged with gas mixture of 20% CO2–80% N2 for 10min to create anaerobic conditions. When the culture reached late exponential growth phase (OD660 =0.5), 10mL inoculum from the vials with highest hydrogen production was withdrawn and was transferred into 90mL BA medium in 250mL serum vials. This repeated batch cultivation procedure (according to Liu et al. [21]) was performed for three months. This enriched culture was then used as inoculum in the subsequent experiments. For estimation of background hydrogen and ethanol production from the yeast extract, the peptone and residual organic matter in the inoculum, control vials where glucose was omitted, i.e. vials with only inoculum, yeast extract and peptone were included. In order to find the effect of medium composition and pH on the production of hydrogen and ethanol from the enriched culture, the concentration of the medium components and pH were adjusted according to the Plackett–Burman (PB) experimental design."
3,Plackett–Burman (PB) experimental design,"2.2 Plackett–Burman (PB) experimental design PB design was employed to screen out the important variables with respect to their main effects. For this purpose, nine variables were chosen as follows: (X 1) substrate (glucose), (X 2) peptone, (X 3) NaHCO3, (X 4) FeSO4, (X 5) yeast extract, (X 6) phosphate buffer (PBS), (X 7) mineral salts, (X 8) initial pH and (X 9) vitamins. Phosphate buffer was a mixture of Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 with a mole ratio of 58:42. Twelve trials were generated by the software Design Expert 5.0 (Table 1 ). Additionally, another batch without substrate addition was used as control. All the trials were conducted in triplicate. The average measurement from the triplicates was used as responded value."
4,Statistical analysis for Plackett–Burman design,"2.3 Statistical analysis for Plackett–Burman design Plackett–Burman design ignores the interaction amongst factors and is based on the first-order model (Eq. (2)), (2) Y = β 0 + ∑ β i X i where Y is the response, Xi is the variable, β 0 is the intercept and βi is the regression coefficient of the model. The main effect of each variable was calculated by Eq. (3): (3) E ( x i ) = 2 ( ∑ M i + − M i − ) / N where E(xi ) is the concentration effect of tested variables, M i+ and M i− are the responded values from the trials where the variable xi was present at high and low concentrations, respectively. And N is the number of the trials (12). According to student's t-test for ANOVA, factors with confidence level of more than 90% were considered to have significant effect on the response. If the effect was negative, it indicated that the required value for increase of hydrogen or ethanol production was equal or less than (≤) the low value in the PB design. If the effect was positive, it indicated the required value for increase of hydrogen or ethanol production was equal or greater (≥) than the high value in the PB design."
5,PCR-DGGE,"2.4 PCR-DGGE PCR-DGGE was used here to study the microbial community structure in the mixed culture. Two milliliters of the mixed culture was withdrawn at the late exponential growth phase (OD660 =0.8), then centrifuged at 5000g for 5min. The pelleted cells were subsequently resuspended in 50μL of sterile MilliQ water. Genomic DNA was extracted and purified using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 51504). For bacteria, universal primer 1492-r and bacteria-specific primer 27-f were used [22] for the first PCR. PCR was performed in a 50μL (total volume) reaction mixture containing 50mM KCl, 20mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.4), 5mM MgCl2, each deoxynucleotide triphosphate at a concentration of 200μM, 1μL of Taq polymerase (2U/μL; Sigma), 10pmol of each primer, and 1μL of DNA extract. The thermal cycling program used for first amplification was as follows: pre-denaturation at 95°C for 5min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30s, annealing at 52°C for 40s, elongation at 72°C for 90s, and post-elongation at 72°C for 5min. The reactions were subsequently cooled to 4°C. The size of the amplicon was estimated on 1.5% agarose gel. Primers 518-r and 357-f (with 40bp GC clamp at the 5′-end) [23] were used to amplify the ∼200bp fragment of the V3 region in second PCR (PCR-2). The amplicon was used as DNA template to incorporate a GC clamp into the DNA fragment prior to DGGE [24]. The PCR-2 program corresponded to 20 cycles of three steps: 94°C for 1min, 65°C for 0.75min, and 72°C for 1min, 10 cycles of three steps: 94°C for 1min, 55°C for 0.75min, and 72°C for 1min followed by a final step at 72°C for 10min. PCR products were stored at 4°C and analysed on 1.5% agarose before DGGE. DGGE analysis of the amplicons obtained from PCR-2 was performed as previously described by Zoetendal et al. [25], using the Dcode Universal Mutation Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with 8% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels and a denaturant gradient of 30–60%. A 100% denaturing solution was defined as 7M urea and 40% formamide. Electrophoresis was performed for 16h at 70V in a 0.5×TAE buffer at 60°C. The DGGE Marker II Set (Nippon Gene, Japan) was co-electrophoresed with the samples. DGGE gels were stained with SYBR Green for 15min and analyzed on GelDoc XR 1708170 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). DGGE profiles were compared using the Quantity One software package (version 4.6.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Similarity indices of the compared profiles were calculated from the densitometric curves of the scanned DGGE profiles by using the Dice product–moment correlation coefficient. The Dice correlation coefficient was directly applied to the array of densitometric values forming the fingerprint. The coefficient is robust and objective, since whole curves are compared and subjective band scoring is omitted. Clustering of patterns was calculated using the unweighted-pair group method using arithmetic mean (UPGMA)."
6,Sequence,"2.5 Sequence The PCR products were excised from the DGGE bands and sent for sequencing (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The final sequences have been submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers FJ588630–FJ588637 FJ588630 FJ588631 FJ588632 FJ588633 FJ588634 FJ588635 FJ588636 FJ588637 . Sequence similarity searches were performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) sequence database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The H2 concentration in the gas phase was measured by using a gas chromatographic apparatus (MicroLab, Arhus, Denmark) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a stainless column packed with Porapak Q (50/80 mesh). Detection limit for H2 was 0.06% (v/v). Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols (ethanol, butanol) in fermentative liquid were determined using gas chromatography apparatus (HP 5890 series II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP FFAP column (dimensions mm). The GC-TCD and GC-FID conditions were set according to Liu et al. [14]. Detection limit for VFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, propionic acid and hexanoic acid) was 0.002% (w/v). Detection limit for ethanol and butanol was 0.0094% (w/v). Glucose, lactic acid and formic acid were determined by HPLC (Agilent) equipped with refractive detector and a column (Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H, 300×7.8mm) operated at 64°C; 4mM H2SO4 was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. Detection limits for glucose, lactic acid and formic acid were 0.001% (w/v), 0.0035% (w/v) and 0.003% (w/v), respectively."
8,Calculations,2.7 Calculations The reported hydrogen and ethanol yields were calculated as moles of hydrogen or ethanol produced per mole of glucose consumed. Glucose consumption was calculated as the difference of initial glucose minus final glucose left in the vials. The background ethanol and background hydrogen were taken into account.
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of pH and medium composition on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of pH and medium composition on hydrogen production Results obtained (data not shown) pointed out that almost complete glucose consumption (95–99%) was observed in all experiments. Hydrogen production was detected within 10h and reached to maximum in approximately 108h under all the conditions (Fig. 1 ). Highest hydrogen production of 298mL H2/g glucose (2.4mol H2/mol glucose, 60% of the theoretical yield) was observed in R6 which is comparable with the yields from other studies using extreme-thermophilic mixed cultures [6,19,26]. Glucose, initial pH, mineral salts, FeSO4 and vitamins were significantly affecting hydrogen production (Tables 2 and 3) . When the initial media pH were 7 and 5.5, the pH did not change significantly (less than 10% change compared to the initial pH) over the entire course of the experiment. That was due to the buffering capacity of the synthetic medium used. High glucose and vitamin concentrations negatively affected the hydrogen production, while oppositely mineral salts, FeSO4 and initial pH showed positive effect. Thus the combinations, low level of glucose (≤2g/L) and vitamins (≤1mL/L) and high level of pH (≥7), mineral salts (≥5mL/L) and FeSO4 (≥100mg/L), were favorable for hydrogen generation. Higher substrate (glucose) loading resulted in VFAs, ethanol and hydrogen accumulation, and thereby caused the inhibition of hydrogen production [17,27]. In the present study, higher initial pH (≥7) was preferred for the extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production. Although many studies reported that pH ranging from 6.2 to7.0 is optimum for extreme-thermophilic fermentation for both pure and mixed cultures [6,13,27], some investigators also showed optimum pH at 6.0 and 7.5 [28,29]. High initial pH facilitated hydrogen production because it compensates for the acidic effect of organic acids forming during fermentation. pH decrease will negatively affect the activity of iron containing hydrogenase enzyme involved in hydrogen synthesis [30]."
11,Effect of pH and medium composition on ethanol production,"3.2 Effect of pH and medium composition on ethanol production Highest ethanol yield of 1.53mol ethanol/mol glucose (76% of theoretical yield) (Table 2) was obtained in R3. This yield was higher than the reported yields ranging from 1.08 to 1.5mol ethanol/mol hexose for extreme-thermophiles including Thermoanaerobacter sp. and Thermoanaerobacterium sp. [31–34]. In our study, initial pH and mineral salts showed negatively significant effect on ethanol production, whereas glucose showed positively significant effect. Consequently, the combination of high level of glucose (≥5g/L), low levels of initial pH (≤5.5) and mineral salts (≤1mL/L) promoted high yield ethanol production. The increase of ethanol yield at higher substrate concentration, low pH (∼4.5) and low mineral salts concentration is due to the change of metabolic pathway leading to the synthesis of more reduced fermentation end products such as ethanol, lactate or alanine [30,35]. Previous studies have shown that when some minerals such as iron are limited (iron limited conditions) the reducing equivalents will be forwarded to ethanol production [35]. This would not only lower the production of hydrogen, but also would increase the production of alcohols, such as ethanol and butanol [36,37]."
12,Simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production,"3.3 Simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production At the applied process conditions and with the enriched culture used, ethanol and acetate were the main liquid fermentation end products from the anaerobic fermentation of glucose, accounting up to 62% and 97%, respectively, based on COD balance (Table 4 ). As ethanol and hydrogen are co-products, optimization of one product was on the cost of another. By controlling the medium composition and pH the fermentation can be directed to the preferred products. This possibility has tremendous potential, where variable and flexible product formation might be of interest. If simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production with a hydrogen and ethanol yield of 40% of the theoretical yield of each product (1.6mol H2 +0.8mol ethanol/mol glucose) is wished, fermentation at conditions as in R5 could be used. At conditions used for R5, a hydrogen yield of 1.58mol H2/mol glucose and an ethanol yield of 0.90mol ethanol/mol glucose were achieved, which correspond to equal optimization of both products. Only one study has so far looked on simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production at thermophilic conditions [8]. The yields obtained have been reported to be 0.68mol H2/mol glucose combined with 1.21mol ethanol/mol glucose obtained with mixed thermophilic culture dominated by Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus [8]. The combined hydrogen ethanol yields obtained in our study were higher compared to this study. The reason for that was probably due to the dedicated optimization of cultivation conditions (medium composition, pH and loading) in our investigation."
13,Effect of pH and medium composition on microbial community structure,"3.4 Effect of pH and medium composition on microbial community structure Qualitative analysis of the bacterial community composition was made to determine possible community changes in response to different cultivation conditions. Results obtained showed that different environmental conditions can quickly lead to community structure differentiation based on different growth rates of community members. Bacterial profiles exhibited a drop in similarity indices (Fig. 2 ) (from 96 to 38) up to 60% between mixed cultures developed under different conditions and original inoculum. All sequences (with an exception of G4 related to class Bacilli) obtained (Table 5 ) were phylogenetically affiliated to class Clostridia, order Thermoanaerobacterales, family Thermoanaerobacteriaceae (genus Caldanaerobacter and Thermoanaerobacter) and family Thermoanaerobacterales Family III, Incertae Sedis (genus Thermoanaerobacterium). Bacilli (similar to a lactic acid producer Bacillus coagulans strain B241) related bacterium (G4) was found solely dominant under condition R5; however, the lactic acid concentration of R5 (2.84mM) was much lower than that of the highest obtained in R10 (11mM), indicating this bacterium was not responsible for lactic acid production, and had little impact on hydrogen or ethanol production. Thermophilic growth of B. coagulans at 60°C was already reported [38] although the growth under 70°C was not tested. Thermoanaerobacter and Caldanaerobacter related bacteria (bands G1, G2, G7 and G8) existed under all conditions which are in line with previous studies demonstrating the ability for coproduction of hydrogen and ethanol with those bacteria [13,39,40,41]. Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum related bacteria appeared under eight conditions (R1, R5, R6, R7, R8, R10, R11 and R12). It has been reported in many cases not only as a hydrogen producer under (extreme-) thermophilic condition with H2 yield ranging from 2.42 to 2.53mol H2/mol hexose [13,42,43], but also as an ethanol producer with high ethanol tolerance [33]. An interesting finding was that band G6 matching 100% T. thermosaccharolyticum was presented only in R7. This band was the only difference in R7 bacterial fingerprint compared with the R6 pattern. The finding was due to the great difference in media composition (particularly glucose, vitamins and yeast extract content) between R6 and R7, resulting in complete sequence matching. Those medium differences can also explain that hydrogen production in R6 was much higher compared to that in R7. Bacterial community structure responsible for highest hydrogen (R6) and highest ethanol (R3) production consisted of common group of Thermoanaerobacter and Caldanaerobacter related bacteria. Results obtained showed that R3 and R4 contained the same functional group of bacteria (the same SI value), but R3 attained the highest ethanol production (1.53mol ethanol/mol glucose), much higher than that observed in R4 (0.66mol ethanol/mol glucose). Besides, for the cases in R10 and R11, hydrogen and ethanol production varied under the same bacterial community structure. This finding could be explained with the shift of metabolic pathway between hydrogen production and ethanol production due to the change in pH and medium composition (substrate concentration, and nutrients). The mixed extreme-thermophilic cultures derived from this study showed relatively flexible ability for both hydrogen and ethanol production depending on the environmental conditions. They could be regarded as simultaneous hydrogen/ethanol producers as hydrogen and ethanol fermentation under all conditions were driven mainly by the group of Thermoanaerobacter, Thermoanaerobacterium and Caldanaerobacter species."
14,Conclusions,"The statistical evaluation of important factors affecting extreme-thermophilic (70°C) hydrogen, ethanol and simultaneous hydrogen andethanol fermentation in mixed culture environment was investigated. It was demonstrated for the first time that hydrogen and ethanol production by the extreme-thermophilic mixed cultures could be regulated by manipulating pH and nutrients formulation; 1.58mol H2/mol glucose combined with an ethanol yield of 0.90mol ethanol/mol glucose was achieved in this study. Glucose, initial pH, mineral salts, FeSO4 and vitamins were determined for their significance in hydrogen production, while initial pH, mineral salts and glucose were significant for ethanol fermentation. Thermoanaerobacter, Thermoanaerobacterium and Caldanaerobacter species were dominant hydrogen and ethanol producers. They could find possible application in continuous reactor systems for biofuel production at elevated temperatures. However, to maintain the maximum flexibility provided by mixed cultures, the retention of slowest growing microorganisms needs to be secured by optimized process configuration. Microbial populations need to be able to respond quickly and provide benefits when influent characteristics change."
