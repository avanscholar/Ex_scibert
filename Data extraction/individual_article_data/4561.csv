0,Introduction,"Carbonyl compounds are vital reliance as intermediates in organic and pharmaceutical synthesis and have been widely exploited in diverse fields of chemical industry, for examples, perfumes, dyestuffs, and agro-processing. Some of the most important carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes (RCOH) and ketones (RCOR’), are commonly produced through catalytic oxidations of primary and secondary alcohols, respectively, invoking viable oxidants [1–4]. Nevertheless, while the oxidations of alcohols represent a facile and economic route for the production of aldehydes and ketones, the radical reactions are difficult to control due to the higher oxidation potential required. In general, compounds of transition metals, e.g., Cr or Mn are used as oxidants while utilizing precious metals such as Ru, Pd, and Au as catalysts during these oxidation reactions [5]. However, there are various drawbacks to using these reagents, including high cost and environmental concerns, which largely limit their industrial applications. Moreover, these oxidative systems are rather aggressive, thus require immoderate conditions (e.g., temperature, acidity, etc.) and may yield unwanted and difficult-to-remove by-products, which further jeopardize their applications. Thus, there is clearly a demand to develop innovative catalyst systems which may activate molecular oxygen effectively while retaining the high selectivity and mild conditions prerequisite for practical industrial applications. In this context, polyoxometalates (POMs), polyatomic ions with three-dimensional framework structure consisting of several types of transition metal oxyanions which are linked together through shared oxygen atoms, have attracted considerable attentions especially as oxidation catalysts. In particular, the POM/H2O2 system, is known to be an efficient, environmental benign, as well as cost-effective catalyst system for oxidation reactions [6–13]. Hydrogen peroxide is a widely used green oxidant, which is easy to handle and commonly applied under mild reaction conditions. On the other hand, POMs are known to exhibit fast and reversible multi-electron redox behaviors under mild conditions, thus, are promising catalysts for the oxidation of alkanes, aromatics, olefins, alcohols [14,15]. However, being soluble in most polar solvents, bulk POM catalysts are adverse for separation and recycling. In addition, their inherent low specific surface areas (typically, <10 m2/g) are also unfavorable for molecular diffusion and mass transport. To circumvent this problem, modified POM catalysts were developed and used. Their structural and acidic properties may also be manipulated through substitution of elemental compositions of the PW12O40 3‒ polyanions, by exchange of counter cation (i.e., H+) with metal ions to form insoluble salts [16–20], by dispersing on porous solid supports such as carbons, alumina, zeolites, and mesoporous silicas [21–24]. For ion-exchanged POMs, the type of exchangeable counter cation normally has a strong influence on the tertiary structure and acidic properties of the inorganic salts, thus, greatly affect their catalytic performances. Alkali (Na+, K+, Cs+, etc.) and transition metal (Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, etc.) ion-exchanged TPAs were found to exhibit high catalytic activity in acetylation and benzylation reactions [19]. Mono transition metal-substituted phosphomolybdate catalysts, namely PMo11M (M=Co, Mn, Ni) were also found to be highly active for oxidations of alcohols [20]. These novel catalysts offer an environmentally benign, solvent-free process for oxidation of alcohols without the drawbacks of waste production, equipment corrosion, and high cost, while facilitate easy catalyst recovery and recycling. Nonetheless, few reports are available on rare earth metal ion-exchanged POMs for application in oxidations of alcohols. Herein, we focus on synthesis and applications of rare earth (RE) metal ion-exchanged TPAs (RE-TPAs) for oxidations of alcohols. A series of lanthanide metals ion-exchanged TPA catalysts, namely M y H 3‒3y PW12O40 (y = 1/3, 2/3, or 1), were prepared by exchanging the ionic proton (H+) with M3+ cation (M=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm). The structural and chemical properties of these catalysts were characterized by different physicochemical techniques. Moreover, their catalytic performances were assessed and compared for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and detailed reaction process, product optimizations, as well as kinetic model of the reaction were also investigated for the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst, which shows the optimal performance."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All the chemicals were analytical grade and were used without further purification unless stated otherwise. The inorganic catalysts were synthesized by first dissolving H3PW12O40 (14.4g) in deionized water at room temperature while under vigorous stirring. Then, an appropriate amount of desirable lanthanide salts, namely M(NO3)3 (M=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm), was added to the above solution at 90°C under continuous stirring. The individual product so obtained after removing the water was dried 120°C followed by a calcination treatment under vacuum at 70°C overnight. Accordingly, a series of lanthanide metals ion-exchanged TPA catalysts were prepared and denoted as M y H 3‒3y PW12O40 (y = 1/3 for La, Pr, Nd, and Sm). For comparison, the cerium series samples, namely Ce y H3‒3 y PW12O40, were prepared by varying the amount of cerium nitrate (y = 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization All samples were characterized by a series of analytical and spectroscopic techniques, such as TGA, XRD, FT-IR, Py-IR, and solid-state 31P MAS NMR. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS-28 spectrometer at room temperature. The XRD study was conducted on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation generated at 40kV and 20mA. The thermal stability of various catalysts was characterized by using a Netzsch TG209 thermal gravimetric analyzer. Typically, the TGA profiles were recorded from room temperature (25°C) to 600°C under N2 environment and a heating rate of 10°C/min. The acidic properties of various catalysts were examined by FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine as well as 31P solid-state NMR of adsorbed TMPO. Py-IR spectra were recorded at room temperature using the same apparatus described above. Each sample was pressed into a self-supporting wafer, degassed in a vacuum manifold at 150°C for 4h, followed by exposing to pyridine vapor at room temperature at first, then, at 100°C for about 1h before removing the physisorbed pyridine. The 31P-TMPO NMR approach has been known to be an important and reliable technique for characterizing the acidic properties of both solid and liquid acid catalysts [25,26]. The solid-state 31P MAS NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker-Biospin Avance 500 spectrometer operating at a Larmor frequency of 202.46MHz using a 4mm double-resonance MAS probehead. The TMPO probe molecule was loaded onto the catalyst sample following a standard operation procedure described elsewhere [25–27]."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The catalytic performance of various catalysts was assessed by oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). All reactions were performed with a 100mL three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser. Desirable amounts of reactant (BzOH), oxidant (H2O2), and water were added onto the M y H 3‒3y PW12O40 catalyst (y = 0, 1/3, 2/3, or 1; M=La, Ce, Pr. Nd, or Sm) in the flask, then, refluxed at 110°C for 4h in an oil bath. Chemical analysis of products was carried out by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890B) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5 capillary column. The BzOH conversion and benzaldehyde (BzH) product selectivity were calculated by means of the internal standard method using biphenyl as the standard."
5,Experimental design and mathematical model,"2.4 Experimental design and mathematical model Response surface methodology (RSM) with a confidence level of 95% was exploited for optimization of experimental parameters based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD). The design of experiments include four independent process variables, namely reactant/oxidant ratio (BzOH/H2O2; x 1), reaction time (x 2), catalyst amount (x 3), and water amount (x 4), as specified in Table 1 . Accordingly, a 34 full-factorial central composite design with three coded levels was used, leading to a total of 29 experimental sets (including 24 factorial points and 5 central points). As shown in Table 1, the four experimental variables were tested at levels coded with either a minus sign (‒1; low level), zero (0; center level), or a plus sign (+1; high level). The coded values of these factors were obtained by the equation [28–31]: (1) x i = X i − X 0 Δ X i where xi, Xi , and X 0 (i = 1‒4) represents the coded, real, and central value of the independent variables, respectively. Whereas ΔXi =(high level−low level)/2 represents the step-change values of the associated variable. A second-order model equation given by RSM was used to optimize the reaction process, to predict the yield of product (i.e., benzaldehyde; BzH), and to reveal the interactions between experimental variables. The response of the experimental design (product yield), Y, may be expressed by a quadratic equation as: (2) Y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 4 β i x i + ∑ i = 1 4 β i i x i 2 + ∑ i < j 4 β i j x i x j where β0, βi, βii , and βij were the regression coefficients representing the offset, linear, quadratic, and interactive terms for the variables, respectively, and xi and xj (i and j = 1‒4) are the uncoded independent variables. The analysis of experimental data, analysis of variance (ANOVA) [28–31], and estimation of regression equation were accomplished by using a Design-Expert 6.0.5 software (Stat-Ease, USA)."
6,Kinetic study,"2.5 Kinetic study Factors such as reactant/oxidant ratio and reaction temperature may also affect the rate of the oxidation reaction, which is an irreversible process. In this context, the reaction rate, r, for oxidation of BzOH with H2O2 to BzH may be expressed by the simplified rate equation: (3) r = − d C A / d t = k ′ C A α C B β where CA and CB represent the instant concentrations of BzOH and H2O2, respectively, k′ is the rate constant, while α and β denote their corresponding reaction order. By taking the natural logarithm, Eq. (3) may be expressed as: (4) ln r = ln k + α ln C A where k = k ′ C B β refers to the modified rate constant. Since the values of k and α for the oxidation reaction at different temperatures may readily be obtained, the rate constant may be correlated with activation energy (Ea ) by the Arrhenius equation: (5) ln k = ln k 0 − E a R 1 T where R is the gas constant, T represents the temperature, and k 0 denotes the pre-exponential factor."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst properties,"3.1 Catalyst properties FT-IR spectroscopy is employed to elucidate the chemical compositions and local configurations of the samples. The IR spectra obtained from various samples are depicted in Fig. S1 (Supplementary materials) of the Supplementary Information. Similar to the pristine TPA (H3PW12O40; Fig. S1a; Supplementary materials), the RE-TPAs, namely M1/3H2PW12O40 (M=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) showed IR profiles with multiple absorption bands spanning between 4000 and 400 cm‒1 (Fig. S1b‒f; Supplementary materials). Among them, the broad overlapping absorption bands centering at ca. 3435 cm‒1 is ascribed due to stretching vibrations of O–H. The peaks at 1080, 983, 889, and 804 cm‒1, which may be attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of P‒O (central PO4 3‒ tetrahedra), and terminal W=Ot, edge-sharing W‒Ob‒W, and corner-sharing W‒Oc‒W of the WO6 6‒ octahedrons, respectively, represent the characteristic absorption bands anticipated for the Keggin unit of the PW12O40 3‒ (PW) polyanions [22,27]. While the weaker absorptions appeared at ca. 598 and 516 cm‒1 were due to symmetric vibrations of O‒P‒O and W‒O‒W, respectively [32]. Likewise, similar IR spectra were observed for the Ce3+-exchanged TPA series catalysts with varied exchange levels. Compared to the pristine TPA, while some variations in peak intensities of characteristic bands responsible for the Keggin structure were found in RE-TPAs, their positions remained practically unchanged regardless of the types and exchange levels. These results indicate the retention of Keggin structure and interactions between the rare earth metal cations and PW polyanions. Similar conclusions may also be drawn from the XRD results, as illustrated for the pristine TPA and Ce y H 3‒3 yPW12O40 series samples in Fig. S2 (Supplementary materials). The diffraction peaks observed for the pristine TPA at 10.3°, 25.3°, and 34.6° reveal the characteristics of Keggin PW polyanions with a long range order (Fig. S2a; Supplementary materials) [23]. However, such long range ordering appear to deteriorate with increasing level of Ce3+ exchange, as revealed by the progressive decreases in intensities of the main diffraction peaks and emerging of new peaks (see Fig. S2b‒d; Supplementary materials), Nevertheless, the Ce3+-exchanged TPA salts appeared to retain the desirable crystallinity. Again, the successful incorporation of rare earth metal cation (Ce3+) onto the pristine H3PW12O40 may be inferred. The thermal properties of the RE-TPA salts were also examined by TGA-DTG technique. As shown in Fig. S3a (Supplementary materials), the TGA-DTG profile of the pristine TPA shows three main weight-loss peaks at 73, 195, and 530°C due to the desorption of physisorbed water, the loss of crystalline water, and the collapse of the Keggin structure, respectively. These findings largely deviate from that of the pure Ce(NO3)3 salt (Fig. S3c; Supplementary materials), which exhibited weight-loss peaks at 150, 206, and 264°C that may be accounted for desorption of physisorbed water, loss of crystalline water, and decomposition of the cerium nitrate, respectively. By comparison, the weight-loss peaks observed for the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 sample (Fig. S3b; Supplementary materials) at 72, 183, and 573°C were rather similar to that of the pristine TPA, with the exceptional presence of an additional weight-loss at 334°C, which may be attributed to collapse of partially distorted Keggin units formed in the presence of the rare earth metal cations (Ce3+). Together with the results obtained from the FTIR and XRD studies, the above results provide additional supports to the notion that the PW polyanions tend to accommodate the rare earth metal cations easily to form crystalline salts that remained stable far beyond the temperatures employed for the catalytic studies (≤120°C). The acidic properties of the pristine and various RE-TPAs¸ which dictate their catalytic performances, were characterized by two spectroscopic techniques utilizing different base probe molecules, namely FT-IR of the adsorbed pyridine (i.e., the Py-IR method) [33] and solid-state 31P MAS NMR of the adsorbed trimethylphosphine oxide (i.e., the 31P-TMPO NMR approach) [25,26]. Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic molecule that is relatively electron deficient, mainly due to the presence of the electronegative nitrogen atom in the ring. As such the pyridine molecule has a strong proton affinity and tends to form PyH+ when in the presence of Brønsted acidic protons, leading to the signature IR absorption bands (denoted as Py-B) at ca. 1540 cm‒1. Pyridine molecule also tends to be adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, leading to absorption peaks (denoted as Py-L) at ca. 1450 and 1600 cm‒1. Meanwhile, the two types of interactions may also contribute to the band at ca. 1490 cm‒1 [34]. As displayed in Fig. 1 , the pristine TPA and Ce3+-exchanged TPAs indeed show four distinct absorption peaks at 1454, 1486, 1535, and 1604 cm‒1, which agree well with the above assignments. However, it is noteworthy that, upon increasing the Ce content (i.e., y) in the Ce y H 3‒3y PW12O40 salts, notable increases in the peak area of the Py-L absorption band at 1454 cm‒1 at the expanses of the Py-B band at 1535 cm‒1 was observed. This clearly indicates that the progressive increase in Lewis acidity with increasing rare earth metal loading (y) is readily accompanied by a gradual decrease in Brønsted acidity. In other word, the superacidic Brønsted acidity possessed by the pristine H3PW12O40 will gradually turn into Lewis acidic CePW12O40 when reaching y = 1.0. Such variation in acidic properties is thus responsible for the different catalytic activities observed for various rare earth ion-exchanged TPAs (vide infra; Table 2 ). By comparing the catalytic activities of various Ce3+-exchanged CeyH3‒3yPW12O40 samples with varied Ce content (y), it is clear that the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst exhibited the best performance during oxidation of BzOH with a conversion of 99.8% and a BzH yield and selectivity of 96.9% and 97.1%, respectively. Moreover, by comparing the performances of other M y H 3‒3y PW12O40 (M=La, Pr, Nd, and Sm) with a fixed metal content y = 1/3 (see Table 2), the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst clearly showed superior catalytic activity. Thus, we focus our investigation mostly on the series of Ce3+-exchanged TPAs and the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 sample is employed as the standard catalyst during process optimization. To gain further insights on acidic features of various catalysts, the solid-state 31P-TMPO NMR approach was adopted. The approach, which exploits basic phosphorous molecule (in this case, TMPO) as probe, has been proven to be a powerful and reliable technique for acidic characterization of solid acid catalysts. Comparing to the conventional techniques such as acid–base titration, calorimetry, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, and 1H NMR, the uniqueness of the 31P-TMPO NMR approach lies on its capability in providing detailed acidic features, viz. type (Brønsted versus Lewis), location (internal versus external), concentration, and strength of acid sites on solid acids. Moreover, it has been shown that a linear correlation exists between the observed 31P NMR chemical shifts (δ31P) of the adsorbed phosphorous probe molecule (such as TMPO) and the proton affinity (i.e., acidic strength) of the Brønsted acid sites [25,26,35]. Thus, the 31P-TMPO NMR approach not only makes possible differentiation of different acid sites but also quantitative measure of their acidic strengths. As the basic TMPO probe molecules are adsorbed onto the acidic catalyst, they tend to interact with Brønsted acidic protons with varied acidic strengths (or proton affinities) to form TMPOH+ complexes with specific distributions of δ31P. Fig. 2 displays the 31P MAS NMR spectra of TMPO absorbed on the pristine H3PW12O40 and Ce3+-exchanged Ce y H 3‒3y PW12O40 (y = 1/3, 2/3, and 1.0) series samples. For comparison, the spectra obtained from TMPO adsorbed on the pure Ce(NO3)3 salt is also appended. The 31P NMR spectrum of TMPO adsorbed on the pristine TPA revealed distribution of resonances that can be roughly categorized into three distinct regions, namely, δ31P=‒10 to ‒30, 55–75, and 80–95ppm (Fig. 2a). The sharp peak observed for the pristine TPA at δ31P=‒15ppm may be unambiguously attributed to 31P resonance of the PW kegging unit, whilst the broad overlapping peaks in the region of 55–75ppm should be due to the presences of (TMPO) n H+ adducts (n > 1.0) in which multiple TMPO molecules are associated with one protonic acid site. The above resonance signals are irrelevant to the assignments of Brønsted acid sites [27]. Rather, it is the signals arising from the TMPOH+ complexes, which locate within the δ31P range of 80‒95ppm, that are readily associated with the assignments of acid sites. For the pristine TPA, the three distinct 31P resonances with δ31P=82.9, 88.3, and 91.2ppm are therefore corresponding to TMPO adsorbed on each Brønsted acidic proton (H+) of the H3PW12O40. The fact that the latter two resonances showed δ31P>86ppm revealed that their acidic strengths readily exceed the threshold for superacidity [25−27]. These resonance features were not observed for TMPO adsorbed on the pure cerium nitrite (Fig. 2e). Upon exchanging the acidic protons (H+) with Ce3+ ions, resonance signals similar to that of parent H3PW12O40 were observed, however, the peaks appeared to be broadened due to the presence of the rare earth metal (Fig. 2b‒d). This indicates that while the Keggin structure remained intact in the Ce y H3‒3 y PW12O40 (y = 1/3, 2/3, 1) catalysts, the local environments surrounding the PW units and Brønsted acid sites may be altered with increasing degree of ion-exchange level. In this context, a continuous distortion of Keggin structural framework with increasing Ce concentration (y) is anticipated along with a progressive decrease in acidic strength. The above notion is supported by the gradual decreases in intensities and areas of resonance peaks with increasing Ce loading, especially within the 89–95ppm region. Moreover, upon introducing the rare earth metal cation onto the TPA, notable increase in peak intensity at ca. 66.5ppm was also observed, indicating the formation of Lewis acid sites (at the expanses of Brønsted acid sites) [25,36]. Unfortunately, this peak responsible for Lewis acidity was heavily overlapped with signals arising from (TMPO) n H+ adducts (n > 1.0), thus, preventing a justifiable description on its variation with Ce loading. Nonetheless, in terms of Brønsted acidic strength in these catalysts, the following order may be inferred: H3PW12O40 > Ce1/3H2PW12O40 > Ce2/3HPW12O40 > CePW12O40."
9,Oxidation of benzyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide,"3.2 Oxidation of benzyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide The catalytic activities of the pristine TPA and various RE-TPAs for oxidation of alcohol to aldehydes were assessed. In particular, the conversion and product yield during oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) over various catalysts were measured, as summarized in Table 2. The reactions were conducted under the conditions: H2O2 loading 11.34g, BzOH loading 5.4g, catalyst amount 0.216g (i.e., 4 wt% relative to BzOH), water amount 20mL, reaction time 4h, and reaction temperature 110°C. Clearly, the partially ion-exchanged catalysts showed satisfactory catalytic performances compared to the pristine H3PW12O40. In particular, the rare earth metal ion-exchanged catalysts showed excellent BzH selectivity compared to the pristine TPA. Among them, the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity with an optimal BzOH conversion (99.8%) and superior BzH yield (96.9%) and selectivity (97.1%). To further explore the role of Lewis acidity on catalytic properties of the RE-TPAs during oxidation of alcohol the catalytic performances of Ce3+-exchanged TPAs with varied Ce loading were evaluated and compared. It is noted that inferences of acid types and their concentrations of an acid catalyst, commonly discussed in terms of the ratio of Brønsted versus Lewis (B/L) acidities, on its catalytic activity have been studied [37]. Based on the aforediscussed results obtained from the two acidity characterization approaches, it is indicative that the pristine H3PW12O40 should possess predominately Brønsted acidity due to the sole presence of acidic H+, the amount of Lewis acidity should increase with increasing Ce3+ loading in Ce y H3-3 y PW12O40 TPA salts. These together with the fact that inferior catalytic performances were observed for the solely Brønsted (H3PW12O40) and purely Lewis (CePW12O40) samples compared to the partially ion-exchanged counterparts (y = 1/3 and 2/3; cf. Table 2) clearly indicate the preference of Brønsted-Lewis acid synergy during alcohol oxidation reaction. Again, the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity. For comparison, an alcohol conversion of 56.5% and a BzH selectivity of 90.9% have been observed over a PMo11Co catalyst [20] and a BzH yield of 92–93% was achieved over amino-functionalized ionic copolymer (or bipyridine)-HPA catalyst systems [7,38]. The aspects on the effect of Brønsted-Lewis acid synergy may be realized: firstly, the increase in oxidation capacity of the oxidant (H2O2) with increasing acidity [39]. Secondly, the existence of strong ionic interactions among the inorganic cation, the Brønsted acidic proton, and the PW polyanion in the RE-TPAs [40]. Clearly, the co-presence of Brønsted and Lewis acidities is favorable for catalytic oxidation of BzOH to BzH. By comparison, purely Brønsted acidic (H3PW12O40) or purely Lewis acidic (CePW12O40) catalysts showed inferior performances (see Table 2). A possible reaction mechanism invoked for benzyl alcohol oxidation over the partially ion-exchanged M1/3H2PW12O40 (RE-TPAs; M=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) is displayed in Scheme 1 [41,42]. The participation of both Lewis (Path 1) and Brønsted (Path 2) acidity is proposed based on the structural characteristics of the catalyst and aforediscussed acidity characterization results. It is anticipated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is widely used as oxidant for oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, should first undergo a β-hydride elimination, then, bond with the carbonyl compounds to form benzaldehyde and H2O as the final products. While the reason for the higher catalytic activity observed for the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst than its RE-TPAs counterparts M1/3H2PW12O40 (M=La, Pr, Nd, and Sm) remains to be answered. It is indicative that the catalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is closely related to the Brønsted versus Lewis acidity (B/L) ratio, which depends not only on the M/H ratio but also the type of incorporated RE metal."
10,Process optimization,"3.3 Process optimization Since the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst was found to exhibit the best catalytic performance among various RE-TPAs examined (cf. Table 2), it was chosen for further process optimization study. The effects of independent experimental variables such as benzyl alcohol to hydrogen peroxide (BzOH/H2O2) molar ratio, reaction time, catalyst amount, and water amount, were investigated together with the reaction temperature. Fig. 3 a shows the variations of BzOH/H2O2 molar ratio on BzOH conversion and BzH yield over the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst. Clearly, both the initial conversion and product yield increase with increasing amount of reactant, reaching a maximum at around BzOH/H2O2 =1:2, then descend gradually afterward. This indicates that a desirable amount of H2O2 oxidant (i.e., a dedicated amounts of BzOH versus H2O2) is favorable for driving the equilibrium toward formation of BzH. However, excess amount of H2O2 led to dilution of reactant (BzOH) and the catalyst, resulted in undesirable oxidation of BzOH, and hence, lowing of BzH yield. The influence of reaction time on catalytic activity was investigated under the experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 3b, the catalytic performance reached a maximum at the reaction time of 4h, leading to a BzOH conversion of 99.8% and BzH selectivity of 97.1%. However, a progressive decrease in activity due to excessive oxidation of BzH and depletion of H2O2 was observed at prolonged reaction time, thus, resulted in spoiling of product selectivity. The role of catalyst amount during the oxidation reaction was also investigated. It is clear that, by varying the amount of catalyst from 2 to 6 wt%, both the conversion and product selectivity first increased gradually to reach a peak value of 99.8% and 97.1%, respectively, at a catalyst loading of 4 wt% (Fig. 3b). Further increase in catalyst loading beyond 4 wt% resulted in a drastic decrease in catalytic activity. This is attributed to the excessive amount of acid sites presented in the reaction system, which provoked decomposition of H2O2 and formation of byproducts due to undesirable oxidation of BzH. The effect of water on catalytic activity during the oxidation reaction was investigated by varying the water amount while keeping other experimental parameters unchanged. Again, a maximum conversion (99.8%) with an optimal BzH selectivity (97.1%) was observed when the water amount reached 20mL. The presence of water is essential during alcohol oxidation reaction, it tends to form special droplets in the heterogeneous reaction system to favor adsorption and/or activation of molecular oxygen [43–45]. In addition, the presence of surface water may also increase the mobility of oxygen on the reducible support to enhance the number of oxygen vacant sites [46,47]. Nevertheless, as the adopted water amount exceeding 20mL, the reaction activity falls off rapidly due to dilution of catalyst system. As such, the deficiency in acid sites led to the decent of catalytic activity. The influence of temperature during the oxidation reaction was also explored. As can be seen from Fig. 3e, a rather low BzOH conversion of 66.4% was observed at 90°C. The conversion notably increased to a maximum of 99.8% with an optimal BzH selectivity of 97.1% as the reaction temperature was raised from 90 to 110°C. However, as the temperature of the reaction further increased to 120°C, notable decreases in conversion (87.3%) and selectivity (72.6%) were observed. Although the mobility of reactant molecules and reaction rate may be accelerated at higher temperatures to provoke formation/breaking of chemical bonds, decomposition of H2O2 is also exacerbated, leading to an overall decrease in catalytic activity. Thus, considering the production cost and energy consumption, oxidation of BzOH over the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst at 110°C would be eminent under the given reaction conditions. The response surface methodology (RSM) implemented with factorial experimental designs were exploited to explore interactive effects between the experimental variables and for optimization of reaction conditions. The yield of benzaldehyde (BzH), denoted as Y, was correlated with four independent experimental variables by a quadratic model: (6) Y = 96.73 + 4.81 x 1 + 1.85 x 2 + 3.74 x 3 + 2.74 x 4 − 7.54 x 1 2 − 3.99 x 2 2 − 5.15 x 3 2 + 0.85 x 4 2 + 1.92 x 1 x 2 − 2.56 x 1 x 3 − 1.25 x 1 x 4 − 5.55 x 2 x 3 − 3.41 x 2 x 4 − 1.27 x 3 x 4 where x 1, x 2, x 3, and x4 represent the four experimental variables whose assignment and coded levels are shown in Table 1. The model was verified with responses obtained from 29 experimental runs, as depicted in Table 3 . The coefficient of determination (R 2) obtained from regression of Eq. (6) was 0.9531, indicating that the model was reliable and there is no obvious difference between the experimental and predicted values. Moreover, the influences of process variables on BzH yield during oxidation of BzOH over the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst as well as the significance of the proposed model (Eq. (2)) were evaluated with the standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. Accordingly, the results obtained from the statistical analyses are summarized in Table 4 . That the F-value (20.32) predicted from the model is much higher than that of the tabulated value at 5% level of significance, together with the value of 2.42 obtained for the coefficient of variation (CV) verify the appropriateness and precision of the proposed model. The interactions between each pair of process variables and corresponding effect on BzH yield during oxidation of BzOH with H2O2 over the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst were further illustrated by the contour plots (Fig. S4; Supplementary materials) and three-dimensional (3D) response surface plots (Fig. S5; Supplementary materials) obtained from the predicted model of RSM. As revealed by the elliptical shape of the contour plot, it is evident that there exists strong correlations between the reaction time (x 2) and catalyst amount (x 3) for the BzH yield (Fig. S4; Supplementary materials). On the other hand, correlations between x 1 (BzOH/H2O2 ratio) and x 2 (reaction time) or x 4 (water amount), which exhibited circular or scattered contour plots, are less significant. Moreover, based on the results of 3D response surface plots (Fig. S5; Supplementary materials), it is indicative that the interaction between BzOH/H2O2 ratio (x 1) and x3 (catalyst amount) have stronger influences on product yield than the interaction of catalyst amount (x 3) and water amount (x 4). These observations were in excellent agreement with the ANOVA data (Table 4) and experimental results (Fig. 3a‒d). On the basis of the results obtained from the 29 experimental sets, the optimal reaction conditions during oxidation of BzOH with H2O2 over the test catalyst (i.e., Ce1/3H2PW12O40) may be derived as: x 1 =1.0:2.2 (BzOH/H2O2 ratio), x 2 =3.9h (reaction time), x 3 =4.2 wt% (catalyst amount), and x 4 =24.3mL (water amount), leading to a predicted BzH yield of 99.94%. To further verify these predicted results, three additional experiments were performed in parallel using these reaction parameters. As a result, an experimental BzH yield of 98.2% was achieved, leading to a product selectivity of 98.4%. Clearly, the results are in excellent agreement with the predicted values, hence, once again justify the validity of the proposed model."
11,Catalyst recycling test,"3.4 Catalyst recycling test The durability and reusability of the RE-TPAs for oxidation of alcohol was also assessed using the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst as the test sample. The test experiments were conducted under mimicked reaction conditions similar to the above optimal conditions and the results were displayed in Fig. 3f. It revealed that the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst was indeed durable after six consecutive experimental cycles without significant losses in conversion and selectivity. The BzH yield and selectivity decreased marginally from 98.2% and 98.4% in the first cycle to 94.9% and 96.8% in the last cycle, respectively. Additional study by FT-IR revealed that the characteristic absorption bands accountable for the Keggin PW polyanions (PW12O40 3−) in TPA remained practically unchanged even after five experimental cycles (Fig. S6; Supplementary materials). The slight decrease in catalytic activity observed during cyclic tests may be attributed to the loss of TPAs during the regeneration treatment; as evidenced by elemental analyses using the ICP technique. It was found that the overall concentration of P atom decreased from 1.05 wt% of the fresh catalyst to 0.75 wt% of the regenerated spent catalyst obtained after six running cycles. In spite of this small drawback, the above results indicate that the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst is not only durable but also recyclable for alcohol oxidation reactions."
12,Kinetic study,"3.5 Kinetic study The kinetic during oxidation of BzOH with H2O2 over the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst was also investigated. The experiments were conducted using reaction conditions optimized by RSM. Accordingly, the reaction rates during the oxidation reaction under varied reactant (BzOH and H2O2) loadings were recorded. Based on the simplified rate equation proposed for an irreversible process (Eq. (3); vide supra), the reaction rate (r) can be directly correlated with the rate constant (k) and the concentrations of BzOH (C BzOH) and H2O2 (CB ) with corresponding reaction order of α and β, respectively, as defined by Eq. (4). The variations of BzOH and H2O2 concentrations with time at various initial CA and CB values are shown in Figs. 4 a and 5 a, respectively. It is clear that the concentrations of both reactants decrease linearly with increasing reaction time. Accordingly, their corresponding reaction order (α and β) may be determined from the log–log plot of reaction rate and concentration, as depicted in Figs. 4b and 5b, respectively. As such, the respective orders of reaction derived from the slope of the log-log plots were found to be 1.5 and 1.0 for BzOH and H2O2, respectively. Moreover, the activation parameters may be derived based on the temperature dependence of the rate equation, as specified by the Arrhenius equation and Eq. (4). Fig. 6 a shows the variations of BzOH concentration with time under different reaction temperatures. An activation energy (Ea ) of 37.3kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor (k 0) of 3612.8L/mol⋅min may be derived from the corresponding Arrhenius plot in Fig. 6b. The rate equation for oxidation of BzOH over the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst may readily be written as: (7) r = − d C A d t = e 7.9 ( − 37.3 R T ) C A 1.5 C B It is worth pointing out that the Ea value so obtained for the present catalytic system is slightly lower than that catalyzed over a bio-reduced Au/TS-1 catalyst (38.2kJ/mol) [48], but much lower than that observed for oxidation of substituted phenethyl alcohols over the a N-chlorinated p-toluenesulfonamide (p-TSA) salt (81.3kJ/mol) [49]. The results indicate that the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst is indeed a highly effective catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones."
13,Conclusions,"A series of rare-earth metal ion-exchanged tungstophosphoric acid catalysts were successfully synthesized and exploited for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with H2O2. The synergy of Brønsted-Lewis acidity was found responsible for the high catalytic activity of RE-TPAs. Among various catalyst examined, the Ce1/3H2PW12O40 catalyst exhibit the best catalytic performance and employed for process optimization to obtain optimal oxidation conditions at reaction temperature of 110°C, BzOH/H2O2 molar ratio 1.0:2.2, reaction time 3.9h, catalyst amount 4.2 wt%, and 24.3mL water, leading to the desirable nearly full BzOH conversion with 98.2% benzaldehyde yield. These optimized experimental values are in good agreement with those predicted by the response surface methodology based on the Box–Behnken design model. Additional recyclability and kinetic studies also indicate that these RE-TPA catalysts are highly efficient, durable, and reusable for long-term operations, in particular for oxidation of alcohols and production of aldehydes and ketones."
