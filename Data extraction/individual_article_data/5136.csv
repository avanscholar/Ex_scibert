0,Introduction,"Cheese whey is a yellowish liquid resulting from the coprecipitation and removal of milk casein in cheese making processes. On average, during the production of 1kg of cheese, 9kg of cheese whey is produced as a by-product. This corresponds to 5 million tons a year of whey worldwide [1–4]. The typical composition of this waste is as follows: 4.5–6wt.% lactose, 0.6–1.1wt.% proteins, 0.8–1wt.% minerals, 0.05–0.9wt.% lactic acid, 0.06–0.5wt.% fats and 93–94wt.% water [1–4]. It has biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values ranging from 27–60kg/m3 to 50–102kg/m3, respectively. Therefore, it should not be directly discharged into the environment without appropriate treatment and/or valorisation [3] hence cheese whey management has become an important issue [1–4]. Two alternative methods of cheese whey management have traditionally been addressed [3]. The first is the application of physicochemical treatments and filtration technologies. Physicochemical treatments include thermal and isoelectric precipitation [5,6], as well as protein precipitation with coagulant/flocculant agents [7]. Filtration technologies include the use of ultrafiltration membranes and reverse osmosis [2]. The second option relies on the application of biological treatments without valorisation, such as aerobic digestion, and with valorisation such as anaerobic digestion, lactose hydrolysis and fermentation [3]. Aerobic digestion consists of the degradation of the organic matter in the whey at room temperature using short hydraulic retention times [8]. Anaerobic digestion is conducted to convert lactose into propionic acid, ethanol and lactose acetates [9]. Lactose hydrolysis is a preliminary step for other processes [4]. Cheese whey fermentation includes the production of ethanol, lactic acid, and hydrogen and many more [10]. The bioconversion of lactose to ethanol has a theoretical maximum yield of 0.538kg ethanol/kg of lactose [11,12]. Anaerobic fermentation has a theoretical yield of 4mol H2/mol lactose and produces a gas made up of a mixture of H2, CO2 and CH4. Another interesting and very promising option for the treatment and valorisation of cheese whey effluents is aqueous phase reforming (APR). APR is a catalytic process carried out at quite low temperatures and moderate pressures that allows the simultaneous production of different gases and liquids from an organic feedstock. The gas phase consists of a gas with a high H2 content, the liquid phase being a complex mixture of different organic compounds in water such as alcohols, ketones, acids, esters, aldehydes, furans, phenols and anhydro-sugars [13–16]. The product distribution strongly depends on the operating conditions under which the process is conducted. Therefore, APR can be customised either for the production of gases, helping to reduce the BOD and COD values of the feed or for the production of valuable liquids. In addition, the APR process dispenses with the need to vaporise the water and the organic compounds of the feedstock, thus reducing the energy requirements [17]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies in the literature concerning the effect of the operating conditions on the aqueous phase reforming of lactose or cheese whey. Holles and Skoglund [18] developed different pseudomorphic overlayer catalysts (Ni/Al2O3, Co/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Ni/SiO2-Al2O3, Co/SiO2-Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2-Al2O3) for the aqueous phase reforming of lactose. Furthermore, works dealing with the aqueous phase reforming of sugars are very scarce. Such studies that there are analyse the aqueous phase reforming of xylitol, sorbitol and galactitol. Jiang et al. [19] studied the APR of xylitol for pentane production over Pt/HZSM-5 and Ni/HZSM-5, analysing the effects of the reaction temperature, pressure and metal loading on the xylitol conversion and pentane selectivity. Kirilin et al. [20] reported the APR of xylitol in a continuous fixed bed reactor over three catalysts: Pt/Al2O3, Pt/TiO2 and Pt-Re/TiO2. Xi et al. [21] prepared different M/NbOPO4 multifunctional catalysts (M=Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, Rh and Ni) for alkane production by the hydrodeoxygenation of sorbitol in aqueous solution. Aiouache et al. [22] developed a lumped kinetic model for the aqueous phase reforming of sorbitol. The model was tested at temperatures ranging from 473K to 523K, using monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni-Pd catalysts supported on Al2O3, ZrO2 and CeO2. Kirilin et al. [23] investigated the APR of xylitol and sorbitol using a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Godina et al. [24] analysed the APR of sorbitol and galactitol using a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst in a continuous fixed-bed reactor at 225°C. Given this background, prior to deal with cheese whey, this work analyses the aqueous phase reforming of a lactose solution, the major organic constituent of this waste, as a possible option for the treatment and valorisation of cheese whey effluents and/or lactose solutions recovered from whey. Specifically, the work addresses the effect of the temperature, pressure, lactose concentration and W/mlactose ratio on the APR of lactose using a Ni-based catalyst. The effect of the operating conditions on the production and selectivity to the different gas and liquid products has never been reported to date. Therefore, the effect of the operating variables on gas, liquid and solid production and on the compositions of the gas and liquid phases has been exhaustively analysed. Furthermore, optimal values for the production of gas and liquid products have also been sought for their selective production. Consequently, this work represents a challenging and novel investigation not only for the management and valorisation of cheese whey but also for the valorisation of sugars or sugar-based streams."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The experiments were carried out in a small bench scale continuous unit for 3h employing a Ni-La/Al2O3 catalyst. The catalyst was prepared by coprecipitation, having 28% (relative atomic percentage) of Ni expressed as Ni/(Ni+Al+La), an atomic La/Al ratio of 0.035 and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 187m2/g. The lactose solutions were prepared dissolving d-lactose monohydrate (C12H22O11⋅H2O Sigma Aldrich, CAS Number 64044-51-5, Bio-Ultra >99.5% HPLC) in Milli-Q water."
3,Experimental rig,"2.2 Experimental rig The experimental rig used in the experiments was a microactivity unit designed and built by PID (Process Integral Development Eng & Tech, Spain). It consists of a stainless steel tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 9mm, heated up by means of an electric furnace [25,26]. The system pressure is reached with the aid of a micrometric valve that automatically adapts its position with the help of a rotor. A pressure gauge located at the exit of the reactor measures the pressure of the reaction section. A PDI control system is used to keep the reactor pressure constant during the experiments. The aqueous solutions of lactose are fed into the reactor by means of a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump (Gilson, model 307). The reaction products (gas and liquids) leave the reactor from its upper part, pass through the valve, where they are depressurised, and arrive at the condensation system. This system consists of several condensers where the liquid products are separated from the gas mixture at intervals of 1h to analyse the evolution over time of the liquid phase. The gas mixture is made up of N2, used as an internal standard, and the different gaseous products formed during the aqueous phase reforming reaction. An Agilent M3000 micro chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) was used for the online analysis of the gas phase. The liquid fractions were collected and analysed offline with a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 GC-system, model G3440A) equipped with Flame Ionization (FID) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) detectors. A schematic diagram of the experimental system is shown in Fig. S1."
4,"Operating conditions, response variables and statistical analyses","2.3 Operating conditions, response variables and statistical analyses The effect of the temperature (200–240°C), pressure (38–50bar), lactose concentration (1–10wt.%) and catalyst mass/lactose mass flow rate ratio (W/mlactose =10–40gcatalystmin/glactose) was experimentally analysed using a design of experiments (DOE) with statistical analysis of the results carried out by means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The effect of the operating conditions on the process was analysed for the following response variables: global lactose conversion (X lactose, %), carbon conversion to gas, liquid and solid products (CC gas%, CC liq%, and CC sol%) as well as the composition of the gas (N2 and H2O free, vol.%) and liquid (relative chromatographic area free of water and un-reacted lactose, %). Table S1 summarises the response variables and the analytical methods used for their calculation. The experiments, listed in Table S2, were designed using a 2k factorial design, where k indicates the number of factors studied (4 operating conditions) and 2k represents the number of runs (16). In addition, 5 replicates at the centre of the variation interval of each factor were carried out in order to evaluate both the experimental error and the curvature shown by the evolution of each variable. This factorial design minimises the number of experiments needed to understand the effect on the process of the operating variables and the interactions between them. As the response variables did not show a linear trend, this design was increased with 8 axial runs following a Box-Wilson Central Composite Face Centred (CCF, α: ±1) design, enabling the operating variables and interactions responsible for the curvature to be identified without modifying the range of study initially considered for the operating variables. The lower and upper limits of all the operating variables were normalised from −1 to 1 (codec factors) to identify their influence in comparable terms. For the analysis of the results, firstly the evolution over time of the response variables was studied. To do this, the results were divided into three intervals, each corresponding to the average value of the studied response variables obtained during each one of the three hours of experiment. All these values (three per experiment) have been compared using a one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test, both with 95% confidence. The results of the ANOVA analyses are provided as p-values. P-values lower than 0.05 indicate that at least two values are significantly different. Furthermore, the LSD test was used to compare pairs of data, i.e. either between two intervals of the same experiment or between two intervals of two different experiments. The results of the LSD tests are presented graphically in the form of LSD bars. To ensure significant differences between any pairs of data, their LSD bars must not overlap. Secondly, the effect of the operating conditions was studied considering the results corresponding to the first hour using a statistical analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) test with 95% confidence. This strategy allows not having to include the effect of the variations with time of the different response variables in the analysis. In addition, the cause-effect Pareto principle was used to calculate the relative importance of the operating variables on each response variable."
5,Possible reaction network for lactose aqueous phase reforming,"2.4 Possible reaction network for lactose aqueous phase reforming A plausible reaction pathway for the aqueous phase reforming of lactose is shown in Fig. 1 . The reaction network includes the formation of gases and liquid products. The formation of these compounds starts with an initial lactose decomposition by hydrolysis into glucose and galactose [27], which can subsequently be decomposed into other intermediate liquids. Three possible parallel routes explain the formation of intermediate liquids from these monomers: glucose/galactose isomerisation to fructose (A) [27–30] and/or retro-aldol fragmentation to erythrose and 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde (B) [30] and/or dehydration to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde [21,22,27,28,31–33] (C). Gases, mainly H2 and CO, are produced by the thermal decomposition and/or reforming reactions of the lactose and all the liquid intermediates (Eq. (1)) as well as by all the decarbonylation reactions that release CO. In addition, the WGS reaction (Eq. (2)) and the methanation reaction (the inverse of methane steam reforming reactions) (Eqs. (3) and (4)) are also possible, explaining the presence of CO2 and CH4 in the gas phase [34,35]. (1) C n H m O k + ( n - k ) H 2 O ⇔ n CO + ( n + m / 2 - k ) H 2 (2) CO + H 2 O ⇔ CO 2 + H 2 (3) CO + 3 H 2 ⇔ CH 4 + H 2 O (4) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ⇔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O 2.4.1 Formation of products via fructose: route A 2,3-dihydroxypropanal and/or 1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-one are produced from fructose via retro-aldol fragmentation [27–30]. The latter can undergo hydrogenation to produce glycerol and/or decarbonylation to form ethane-1,2-diol [29,30]. On the one hand, glycerol can be dehydrated to 1-hydroxypropan-2-one, which can then undergo hydrogenation to produce propane-1,2-diol [13,14,36–38]. Propane-1,2-diol can subsequently be dehydrated to form propan-2-one and/or propionaldehyde, which can be hydrogenated to propan-2-ol and propan-1-ol, respectively [36]. Afterwards, these two chemicals can be further transformed into butane and propane [14,36–38]. Ethanol might be formed from the hydrogenation of propan-2-ol [14]. On the other hand, ethane-1,2-diol can evolve towards 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde formation via dehydrogenation, which might lead to the formation of methanol by decarbonylation [13,14], or to the production of acetaldehyde and/or ethanol via dehydration and dehydration/hydrogenation, respectively [13,14,37]. Acetaldehyde can subsequently be transformed into acetic acid and/or methane, while ethene and ethane can be produced from ethanol [13,14,37]. 2.4.2 Formation of products via erythrose and 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde: route B Erythrose can undergo further hydrogenation to erythritol and/or hydrogenation/dehydration to 1,2-butane-diol. Subsequently, 2-butanol can be produced via hydrogenation/dehydration [30]. Butan-2-one and butane can be produced from the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation/dehydration of this latter compound. Ethane-1,2-diol can be produced from the hydrogenation of 2-hydroxyacetaledhyde and can either undergo further hydrogenation/dehydration to ethanol and/or dehydration to acetaldehyde. Ethanol can subsequently be dehydrated to ethene and hydrogenated to produce ethane, while acetaldehyde can subsequently be transformed into acetic acid and/or methane [13,14,37]. 2.4.3 Formation of products via 5-hydroxymetyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde: route C 5-hydroxymetyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde can be transformed into 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde via hydrogenation/dehydration, and/or hydrogenated to 5-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-carbaldehyde and/or decarbonylated/dehydrogenated to produce furfural and/or can evolve to (E)-4-(5-(hydroxymethyl)furan-2-yl)but-3-en-2-one via aldol-condensation [28,31,39,40]. Subsequently, 5-methyl-2-furaldehyde can be dehydrated giving formic acid and levulinic acid. This latter can be hydrogenated to 5-methyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one [33,39,40]. In addition, (1E,4E)-1,5-bis(5- (hydroxymethyl)furan-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one and 2-(hydroxy(5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2- yl)methyl)-5(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-carbaldehyde can be produced from (E)-4-(5-(hydroxymethyl)furan-2-yl)but-3-en-2-one and 5-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-carbaldehyde, respectively, via retro-aldol condensation [28,31,39,40]. Furthermore, furfural can undergo hydrogenation to 2-furomethanol and/or decarbonylation to furan [32,39,41]. Furan can be hydrogenated to tetrahydrofuran, which can firstly evolve to butanol through ring opening and subsequently to butane via dehydration [42]. 2-furomethanol can undergo further hydrogenation to 2-furanmethanol, tetrahydro- and/or hydrogenation/dehydration to 2-methylfuran and/or dehydration to 2-cylcopenten-1one [39]. Subsequently, 2-furanmethanol, tetrahydro can be hydrogenated/dehydrated to 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran. 2-pentanol and 1,5-pentane-diol can be obtained from this latter chemical through hydrogenation and ring opening, respectively [32]. 2-methylfuran can be hydrogenated to 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran and/or hydrogentated/dehydrated to 2methyl-2cyclopenten-1one and/or evolve to 1-pentanol via ring opening. Cyclopentanone can be produced from the hydrogenation of 2cyclopenten-1one. This latter can be hydrogenated to cyclopentanol [32]."

7,"Global lactose conversion and carbon distribution: CC gas, CC liq and CC sol","3.1 Global lactose conversion and carbon distribution: CC gas, CC liq and CC sol A complete and steady global lactose conversion (X lactose) was achieved in all the experiments, indicating that all the lactose was converted into gas, liquid and solid products. The C/O ratio close to 1 of lactose allows a complete conversion to be achieved [34,43]. Fig. S2 shows the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol obtained for the experiments, which vary as follows: 5–41%, 33–97% and 0–59%, respectively. Increases and reductions in these variables over time are detected in some experiments. The general trend for the CC gas is a steady evolution. However, decreases over time occur for some experiments (2–4, 6, 8, 13–15, 23, 24, 27 and 29). These decreases are particularly marked for experiments 8, 13, 15 and 29. One exception is experiment 8, where a lower W/mlactose ratio (10gcatalystmin/glactose) was used. The drops for the CC gas are more marked at operating conditions under which gas production is more favoured [25]. The CC liq displays increases (experiments 1, 9–13, 23–25, 27–29) and decreases (experiments 6 and 8) over time. In particular, sharp increases are observed for runs 1, 11 and 13. Most of the slight decreases observed for the CC gas take place along with increases in the CC liq (experiments 13, 14, 23, 24, 27 and 29). This evolution of the C product distribution is consistent with the work of Wawrzetz et al. [37] and Remón et al. [25], who demonstrated that the formation of H2 and CO2 via dehydrogenation followed by decarbonylation with the subsequent water gas shift is one of the fastest reactions during aqueous phase reforming. In addition, gas production decreases with catalyst deactivation, thus increasing the production of intermediate liquid products. Sharp increases in the CC sol are observed for experiments 6, 8 and 15, while decreases take place for experiments 1 and 11. Most of the decreases in the CC sol occur along with increases in the CC liq and vice versa (6 and 8–10). The decrease observed in the CC gas for experiments 13 and 15 accounts for the increases in the CC liq and CC sol, respectively, which might indicate a change in the product selectivity over time. Experiments 6 and 8 were performed using the highest temperature (240°C) and lactose concentration (10wt.%), along with the lowest W/mlactose ratio used in this work. Sugar molecules are unstable at the temperatures of this process and quickly decompose through pyrolysis, leading to the formation of char particles and gases [35]. This solid residue (char) can also be obtained from polymerised degradation products such as humic acids and large organic compounds ranging from C8 to C15 [23,27,28,31,33,39,41]. The formation of these macromolecules can occur from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde (route C). Furthermore, both lactose monomers (glucose and galactose) can react with other liquid intermediates or with 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde by cross-polymerisation. These reactions are favoured at high temperature and pressure [27,28,31,33]. In addition, char obtained from the pyrolysis of different biomass materials has been reported to have catalytic activity for the reforming and cracking of different hydrocarbons [44–50], which accounts for the decreases over time in the CC sol [34,35] and the increases in the CC liq observed in some experiments. The specific effect of the operating conditions as well as their possible interactions on the process has been studied considering the results obtained during the first hour of reaction. The models created in terms of codec factors considering the ANOVA analysis and the relative importance of the operating variable taking into account the cause-effect Pareto analysis are shown in Table S3. The CC gas is strongly affected by the lactose concentration, both linear and quadratic terms, and the interaction between the temperature and the W/mlactose ratio (T2W). An increase in the lactose concentration increases the CC gas. The temperature and its interaction with the W/mlactose (T2W) are the operating variables with the greatest effect on the CC liq and the CC sol. In addition, significant interactions between the operating variables also influence the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of the operating variables and the most important interactions on the product distribution in carbon basis, according to the ANOVA analysis. Specifically, Fig. 2 a and b, e and f, and i and j shows the effects on the CC gas, CC liq and CC sol of the reaction temperature, employing a pressure of 38bar for W/mlactose ratios of 10 and 40gcatalystmin/glactose, when feeding 1 and 10wt.% lactose solutions, respectively. Fig. 2 c and d, g and h, and k and l displays the effect of the temperature for W/mlactose ratios of 10 and 40gcatalystmin/glactose employing a pressure of 50bar when lactose solutions of 1 and 10wt.%, respectively, were used. 3.1.1 Carbon conversion to gas: CC gas The effect of the temperature on the CC gas depends on the pressure and concentration of lactose in the solution. At 38bar, two trends are observed depending on the lactose concentration. When a 1wt.% lactose solution is fed, the CC gas is low (8–14%) and neither the temperature nor the W/mlactose exert a significant effect on the CC gas. Conversely, for a 10wt.% lactose solution, the temperature has a greater influence on the CC gas and the effect of the temperature depends on the W/mlactose ratio. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose, the CC gas remains low and steady (around 12%) between 200 and 220°C and decreases slightly with a further increase in the temperature up to 240°C. For a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose an increase in the temperature from 200 to 240°C decreases the CC gas. In general, the CC gas is relatively low, which indicates that gas formation is not favoured at low pressure [19,23,51]. In addition, at 38bar feeding a 10wt.% lactose solution, the W/mlactose ratio significantly promotes gas production and an increase from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose produces an increase in the CC gas due to its positive kinetic effect on cracking and reforming reactions [25]. At 50bar of pressure, the temperature exerts a greater effect on gas production than at 38bar, and greater amounts of CC gas are obtained, especially for concentrated lactose solutions and high W/mlactose ratios. These conditions favour gas production from lactose and its liquid intermediate due to the positive kinetic effect of the catalyst. An increase in pressure favours gas formation [25] due to a increase in the rate of C-C bond cleavage reactions [52]. An increase in the CC gas when increasing the total pressure of the system has also been reported for the APR of xylitol [19] and other oxygenated compounds [17,53,54]. Regardless of the lactose concentration, the gas production displays a minimum with temperatures between 200 and 240°C. Specifically, an increase in temperature from 200 to 220°C decreases the CC gas, while a further increase from 220 to 240°C increases the CC gas regardless of the lactose concentration and W/mlactose ratio. This evolution depends on the W/mlactose ratio. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose the CC gas is relatively low and the decrease and the subsequent increase in the CC gas observed with the variation in temperature are not as marked as for 40gcatalystmin/glactose. For 40gcatalystmin/glactose a pronounced decay followed by a sharp increase in the CC gas occurs. At low temperatures (200–220°C) the positive kinetic effect helps to shift the reaction towards the formation of intermediate liquids, increasing the CC liq. Conversely, a further increase in temperature up to 240°C favours the transformation of these liquid products into gases, decreasing the CC liq [25]. As regards the W/mlactose ratio, an increase from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose does not greatly modify the CC gas for a 1wt.% lactose solution, while it increases the CC gas for a 10wt.% lactose solution within the whole temperature range considered. Gas production is kinetically favoured at high pressure and using a concentrated lactose solution due to the positive kinetic effect of these variables [25]. The effect of the lactose concentration can be gathered comparing Fig. 2a with b and c with d. This effect depends on the pressure and W/mlactose ratio. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose, the effect of the lactose concentration is very weak regardless of the pressure. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose the lactose concentration exerts a greater influence. At 38bar, the CC gas increases within the whole temperature range considered, especially between 200 and 220°C. At 50bar, a great increase in the CC gas takes place for 40gcatalystmin/glactose regardless of the reaction temperature. As regards the effect of the pressure, a comparison between Fig. 2 a with c and b with d shows the effect of this operating variable on the CC gas when 1 and 10wt.% lactose solution are used, respectively. For a 1wt.% lactose solution, the effect of the pressure is very weak. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose the decrease observed in the CC gas is slightly greater. For a 10wt.% lactose solution the CC gas does not greatly vary when the pressure increases from 38 to 50bar between 200 and 220°C, while a great increase in the CC gas takes places between 220 and 240°C. The effect of pressure is only significant when gas production is favoured [25]. The pressure exerts a significant influence on the kinetics of the process, since an increase in the total pressure of the system also increases the partial pressures of lactose and its intermediates, increasing the reaction rates of lactose APR reactions and thus enhancing gas production as reported in other works studying the APR of glycerol [17,53,54] and sorbitol [19,21]. 3.1.2 Carbon conversion to liquid and solid products: CC liq and CC sol The CC liq and CC sol show opposite tendencies, i.e. an increase in the former takes place along with a decrease in the latter and vice versa. A statistically significant and high relationship (p-value<0.0001; R2 =0.91) was found between the CC liq and CC sol by means of the Spearman’s multivariate test. The effect of the temperature on the CC liq and CC sol depends on the concentration of lactose in the solution and the W/mlactose ratio. For a 1wt.% lactose solution and a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in the reaction temperature increases the CC liq and decreases the CC sol regardless of the pressure. Conversely, when a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose is used, the CC liq increases between 200 and 220°C and decreases with a further increase in the temperature up to 240°C regardless of the lactose concentration. For a 10wt.% lactose solution different evolutions for the CC liq and CC sol are observed depending on the temperature, pressure and W/mlactose ratio. An increase in temperature decreases the CC liq and increases the CC sol when a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose is used. The increase in the CC sol only occurs at low pressure (38bar), while at high pressure (50bar) the CC sol remains steady with the temperature and the decrease in the CC liq occurs along with an increase in the CC gas. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose the CC liq increases between 200 and 220°C and decreases with a further increase in temperature up to 240°C. The effect of the pressure on the CC liq/CC sol can be gathered comparing Fig. 2e/i with g/k and 2 f/j with h/l for lactose concentrations of 1 and 10wt.%, respectively. The effect of the pressure is at its highest for 40gcatalystmin/glactose, and an increase from 38 to 50bar between 200 and 230°C increases the CC liq and reduces the CC sol for a 1wt.% lactose solution. For a 10wt.% lactose solution an increase in the pressure from 38 to 50bar decreases the CC liq and increases the CC sol between 200 and 220°C, while minor changes occur between 220 and 240°C. The effect of the W/mlactose ratio depends on the lactose concentration and pressure. At 38bar, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose decreases the CC liq and increases the CC sol for a 1wt.% lactose solution. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose increases the CC liq and decreases the CC sol between 210 and 230°C. A further increase in temperature up to 240°C decreases the CC liq and increases the CC sol. The analysis of the liquid product reveals that the concentration of furans in the liquid increases when increasing the concentration of lactose in the solution for a low W/mlactose ratio at 38bar. This suggests that polymerisation reactions might occur with a lesser spread as the concentration of lactose increases. Therefore, for a diluted lactose solution, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio promotes polymerisation reactions, thus increasing the CC sol. Conversely, for a concentrated lactose solution the thermal decomposition of lactose might be responsible for char formation and an increase in the W/mlactose ratio mitigates char formation and/or helps its removal. At temperatures between 230°C and 240°C this increase in the W/mlactose ratio increases char production, probably due to the higher spread of polymerisation reactions. At 50bar, an increase from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose does not significantly influence the CC liq and CC sol between 200 and 220°C for a 1wt.% lactose solution. Conversely, for a 10wt.% lactose solution, this increment in the W/mlactose ratio decreases and increases the CC liq and CC sol, respectively, from 200 to 210°C. Between 220 and 240°C, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose decreases the CC liq and increases the CC sol regardless of the pressure due to the greater spread of condensation and cross-polymerisation reactions [27,28,31,33]. The temperature exerts a positive kinetic effect on the process. When a low amount of catalyst is used, an increase in the temperature helps to decrease solid formation. However, an increase in the amount of catalyst in the bed also produces a greater spread of polymerisation, cross-polymerisation and condensation reactions from furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde. These two latter compounds, found in some of the liquid condensates, might lead to the formation of large molecules [23,27,28,31,33,39,41] that are insoluble in water and can promote char formation [27,28,31,33]. These chemical reactions leading to the formation of polymers are favoured at high temperature and pressure. Therefore, at temperatures between 220 and 240°C the CC liq decreases and the CC sol increases very sharply as high temperatures promote polymerisation reactions [27,28,31,33] and lactose decomposition through pyrolysis, leading to the formation of char particles [35]."
8,Effect of the operating conditions on the volumetric composition of the gas,"3.2 Effect of the operating conditions on the volumetric composition of the gas Fig. S3 shows the composition of the gas obtained for the experiments divided into three intervals of 60min each. The gas phase is made up of a mixture of H2 (8–58vol.%), CO2 (33–90vol.%), CO (0–18vol.%) and CH4 (0–14vol.%). As regards the evolution of the gas composition over time, H2 and CO2 display the greatest variations. Statistically significant decreases are detected for the proportion of H2, while increases occur for the relative amount of CO2 in the gas. This H2 depletion was also observed in the work of Kirilin et al. [23] during the APR of xylitol and sorbitol. They reported that the oxygenated compounds formed during the APR process might adsorb on the surface of the catalyst, thus hindering the catalyst performance and leading to a decrease in the H2 selectivity. This development is also responsible for the increase in the proportion of CO2 in the gas over time, as thermal lactose decomposition might be more favoured over reforming with the progressive deactivation of the catalyst. In addition, the decrease in the proportion of H2 in the gas may also be attributed to the structural changes of the alumina of the support [23]. The alumina of the catalyst support can be transformed into boehmite by water [52,55,56]. This transformation was reported in a previous work where this catalyst was used for the APR of crude glycerol [25]. The proportions of CO and CH4 remain steady for the vast majority of the experiments. In general, small variations are detected for the proportion of CO in the gas. One exception is experiment 16, where a relatively high increase in the proportion of CO over time takes place. The proportion of CH4 shows small variations over time. In some experiments an initial decrease in the proportion of CH4 takes place between the first and second hour of reaction, along with a posterior increase in its relative amount between the second and third hour. However, these variations are not important from a practical point of view due to the relatively low amount of CH4 in the gas. The specific effects of the operating conditions as well as their possible interactions on the volumetric composition of the gas were studied considering the results obtained during the first 60min of reaction. Table S4 shows the results of the statistical analyses performed. These analyses show that the temperature, the W/mlactose ratio and the interaction between these two operating variables are the variables with the greatest influence on the proportion of H2 in the gas. The temperature and the W/mlactose are the operating variables exerting the greatest influence on the proportion of CO2. The concentration of CO in the gas is mostly affected by the interactions between the temperature and the concentration of lactose (TC and T2C). The concentration of lactose substantially influences the relative amount of CH4 in the gas. Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of these interactions according to the ANOVA analysis on the composition of the gas. The effects of the reaction temperature, at 38bar and 50bar for W/mlactose ratios of 10 and 40gcatalystmin/glactose, feeding a 1wt.% lactose solution, are shown in Fig. 3 a and c, e and g, i and k, and m and o. Fig. 3 b and d, f and h, j and l, and n and p displays the effect of the temperature and the W/mlactose ratio at 38 and 50bar for a 10wt.% lactose solution. 3.2.1 H2 and CO2 The reaction temperature exerts a great influence on the concentrations of H2 and CO2. An increase in the former gas occurs along with a decrease in the latter and vice versa, as explained above. Therefore, the effect of the operating conditions is fully described for the proportion of H2, the relative amount of CO2 showing the opposite effect in most cases. In general, two trends are observed for the evolution of H2 and CO2 depending on the W/mlactose ratio. For a low W/mlactose ratio (10gcatalystmin/glactose) an increase in the temperature has little impact on the volumetric composition of these two gases regardless of the lactose concentration and pressure. Exceptionally, for a 10wt.% lactose solution at low pressure (38bar), a substantial increase in the proportion of H2 occurs. The sharp increase in the CC sol obtained at 38bar using a 10wt.% lactose might account for this development, as most of the carbon in the feed is transformed to solid, which results in a gas with a higher H2 content. Conversely, for a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose two trends are observed depending on the lactose concentration. For a 1wt.% lactose solution, an increase in the temperature from 200 to 220°C decreases the proportion of H2 in the gas regardless of the pressure. An increase in the W/mlactose ratio increases H2 generation by reforming. Between 200 and 220°C the proportions of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols in the liquid increase dramatically, which is accounted for by a greater spread of H2 reactions which increase the consumption of H2 [25]. Conversely, for a 10wt.% solution this same increase in temperature does not modify the proportion of H2 in the gas, while the increase observed in the proportion of CO2 still takes place, although milder than that occurring for a 1wt.% lactose solution. Hydrogen solubility increases with pressure, thus hydrogenation reactions in the liquid phase may be more favoured. The higher the lactose concentration, the lower the amount of water and consequently the higher is the partial pressure of H2 [25]. A further increase in the temperature from 220 to 240°C results in a substantial increase in the H2 concentration regardless of the lactose concentration and pressure. The H2 solubility in the liquid phase decreases with the temperature, diminishing the extent of the hydrogenation reactions, thus augmenting the proportion of H2 in the gas especially between 220 and 240°C [37]. In addition, the reforming reactions are endothermic while the WGS reaction is exothermic, which also results in an increase in H2 with the temperature [13,17]. The W/mlactose ratio exerts a significant effect on the concentrations of H2 and CO2 between 200 and 215°C and 225–240°C. This effect depends on the concentration of lactose in the feed. For a 1wt.% lactose solution, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose results in an increase in the proportion of H2. An increase in the W/mlactose ratio favours reforming reactions, increasing H2 production [25]. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, the effect of the W/mlactose ratio is only significant between 225 and 240°C. Within this temperature range, an increase in the amount of catalyst leads to an increase in the proportions of H2 due to the positive kinetic effect of the catalyst on the reforming reactions together with the decrease in the H2 solubility with temperature. At low temperature, the compensation between H2 production and H2 consumption in hydrogenation reactions accounts for the negligible effect of the W/mlactose ratio. The effect of the concentration of lactose in the feed on the proportion of H2/CO2 in the gas can be gathered comparing Fig. 3a/e with b/f at 38bar and Fig. 3c/g with d/h at 50bar. This comparison reveals that the effect of the lactose concentration depends on the temperature and pressure. Between 200 and 220°C the concentration of lactose exerts a weak impact on the proportions of these two gases. Conversely, between 220 and 240°C the concentration of lactose substantially influences the proportions of H2 and CO2 in the gas. At 38bar, a sharp increase in the proportion of H2 takes place due to the increase in the partial pressure of the reagents inside the reactor [25]. At 50bar the effect of the lactose concentration depends on the W/mlactose ratio. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in the lactose content from 1 to 10wt.% very slightly decreases and increases the proportions of H2 and CO2, respectively, probably due to the increase in char formation. An increase in the W/mlactose ratio lowers the effect of the lactose concentration on the relative amount of H2. As a result, the effect of the lactose concentration on the proportion of H2 for a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose is not significant, while the proportion of CO2 decreases slightly between 230 and 240°C. Under these conditions the decrease in the proportion of CO2 is the consequence of the increase observed in the proportion of CO in the gas. A comparison between Fig. 3a/e and b/f with c/g and d/h shows the effect of the total pressure on the proportion of H2/CO2 in the gas when lactose solutions of 1 and 10wt.% are fed, respectively. This comparison reveals that the effect of the pressure depends on the concentration of lactose. For a 1wt.% lactose solution and 10gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in the total pressure from 38 to 50bar does not greatly modify the proportions of H2 and CO2 in the gas. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose, this increase in pressure slightly increases the proportion of CO2 between 200 and 220°C; the effect of the pressure being insignificant from 220 to 240°C. For a 10wt.% lactose solution the effect of the pressure depends on the reaction temperature. The pressure does not exert a great impact between 200 and 220°C, while the proportions of these two gases are greatly modified with varying the system pressure when a temperature between 220 and 240°C is used. From 220 to 240°C, an increase in pressure from 38 to 50bar leads to a decrease in the relative amount of H2 when using a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose. In addition, these variations depend on the W/mlactose ratio; the lower the ratio, the greater are the variations in the proportions of H2 and CO2. An increase in pressure produces an increase in the partial pressure of the reagents inside the reactor, which promotes their transformation into gases [25] due to an increase in the rate of C-C bond cleavage reactions [52] favouring H2 production. 3.2.2 CO and CH4 The effect of the operating variables on the proportions of CO and CH4 is weak and the relative amounts of these two gases during the first hour of reaction are lower than 15vol.%. Under the temperatures studied in this work, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction is shifted towards H2 and CO2, which explains the low proportion of CO in the gas. The effect of the temperature on the proportion of CO depends on the pressure and the W/mlactose ratio. In general the effect of the temperature on the proportion of CO in the gas is very weak. At 38bar, the temperature does not influence the proportion of CO in the gas, which is lower than 4vol.% regardless of the W/mlactose ratio and the lactose concentration. At 50bar, the effect of the temperature is only significant when feeding a 10wt.% lactose solution using a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose. Under these conditions an increase in temperature increases the proportion of CO in the gas very sharply, which could indicate that decarbonylation reactions are intensified under these operating conditions [25]. The effect of the W/mlactose ratio on the proportion of CO depends on the pressure and lactose concentration. At low pressure (38bar), an increase from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose does not modify the relative amount of CO in the gas. Conversely, at 50bar, this same increase leads to a small decrease in the proportion of CO when feeding a 1wt.% lactose solution, while a sharp increase is observed for a 10wt.% lactose solution as explained above. The effects of the pressure and the lactose concentration on the proportion of CO in the gas are negligible, as CO formation is not thermodynamically favoured at temperatures lower than 240°C. The effect of the temperature on the proportion of CH4 in the gas depends on the concentration of lactose, pressure and W/mlactose ratio. Specifically, the temperature does not significantly influence the proportion of CH4 for a diluted lactose solution (1wt.%), while it exerts a moderate influence for a 10wt.% lactose solution. For a 10wt.% solution the effect of the temperature depends on the pressure and the W/mlactose ratio. At 38bar, an increase in the reaction temperature increases the proportion of CH4 for a low W/mlactose ratio, while this increase in temperature decreases the relative amount of CH4 for a high W/mlactose ratio. At 50bar, an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the proportion of CH4 in the gas regardless of the W/mlactose ratio. The decreases in the proportion of CH4 in the gas are the consequence of the endothermic nature of the methane reforming reaction [14] which is thermodynamically favoured at high temperatures and kinetically promoted using a high W/mlactose ratio. As a result of the dependence of the effect of the temperature with the lactose concentration and the W/mlactose ratio, the effect of the W/mlactose ratio is only significant for a 10wt.% lactose solution. The lower excess of water for a concentrated lactose solution reduces the development of the methane reforming reactions, increasing the proportion of CH4 in the gas [57–61]. For a concentrated solution, an increase in this ratio (from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose) increases the proportion of CH4 in the gas between 200 and 220°C, as methanation is favoured within this temperature range [25]. The effect of the total pressure is only significant for a 10wt.% lactose solution. Between 200 and 220°C an increase in pressure leads to an increase in the proportion of CH4 in the gas, while a further increase up to 240°C reduces the relative amount of this gas."
9,Effect of the operating conditions on the composition of the liquid phase,"3.3 Effect of the operating conditions on the composition of the liquid phase Fig. S4 summarises the relative amount of each of the different families of liquid compounds for the different experiments represented in 3 intervals of 60min each. The liquid phase is made up of a mixture of aldehydes, carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones and furans in water. Acetaldehyde is the most abundant compound for the aldehydes, while the carboxylic acids are mainly made up of acetic and propionic acids and, in a lower proportion, pentanoic acids. Alcohols include monohydric alcohols (mainly methanol and ethanol, and in lower proportions 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-pentanol and 2-pentanol), polyhydric alcohols (1,2-propanediol, 1,2-ethanediol, 2,3-butanediol) and, in lower proportions, monohydric substituted (2-methyl-3-pentanol) and alicyclic alcohols (2-furanmethanol). Ketones include C3-ketones such as 2-propanone (acetone) and 2-propanone-1-hydroxy, C4-ketones (2-butanone-3-hydroxy and 2-butanone-1-hydroxy, 2,3-butanedione and 2 butanone) and small amounts of cyclic ketones (cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone) and furanic ketones (2-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone). Furans comprise furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancaboxaldehyde and 5-methyl-2-furancaboxaldehyde. The presence of these compounds in the condensates is consistent with the pathway proposed in Fig. 1 and those proposed by several authors studying the APR of polyols and sugar based compounds [13,14,19–23,27–33,36–39,41,42,54,62,63]. The statistical analysis reveals significant differences (p-values<0.005) in the relative amounts of these compounds in the liquid phase. The results of the Fisher’s LSD test are plotted in Fig. S4. The relative concentration for the most abundant compounds, expressed as relative chromatographic area, varies as follows. Aldehydes: 0–11%, carboxylic acids: 0–22%, monohydric alcohols: 0–23%, polyhydric-alcohols: 0–48%, C3-ketones: 4–100%, C4-ketones: 0–18%, cyclic-ketones: 0–15% and furans: 0–85%. Increases and decreases in the proportions of these families with time are detected. Carboxylic acids, monohydric alcohols and C3 and C4 ketones display increases and decreases over time. Aldehydes and cyclic ketones mostly show decreases, while increases are mainly observed for furans. These variations have been analysed with the multivariate Spearman’s. The multivariate analysis reveals significant relationships for the proportion of C3-ketones with the proportions of monohydric alcohols (p-value=0.0001; R2 =0.55) and carboxylic acids (p-value=0.0215; R2 =0.24); and between the proportion of cyclic ketones and the proportions of C4-ketones (p-value=0.0001; R2 =0.41) and aldehydes (p-value=0.0001; R2 =0.56). In addition, the proportion of furans depends on the proportion of carboxylic acids (p-value=0.0001; R2 =0.42). These relationships can explain most of the variations of the liquid phase composition and confirm the pathway shown in Fig. 1. Table S4 shows the significant terms in the codec model and their relative influence in the process according to the ANOVA analysis for the proportions of the most abundant families of compounds present in the liquid phase during the first hour of reaction: aldehydes, carboxylic acids, monohydric and polyhydric alcohols, ketones (C3, C4 and cyclic) and furans. The interactions of the temperature with the W/mlactose ratio and lactose concentration with the W/mlactose ratio greatly influence the composition of aldehydes in the liquid. Carboxylic acids are influenced by the pressure and the interactions of temperature with both the lactose concentration (TC and T2C) and the pressure (T2P). The interactions of the temperature with the lactose concentration (T2C) and with the system pressure (T2P2) are the major factors responsible for the evolution of the proportions of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols. In addition, polyhydric alcohols are greatly influenced by the temperature (T2). The pressure (P2) and the interaction of the temperature with the lactose concentration (T2C) have a high impact on the proportion of C3-ketones, while C4-ketones mainly depend on the interactions between the temperature, pressure, lactose concentration and W/mlactose ratio (TPC and TCW). Cyclic ketones are strongly influenced by the lactose concentration and its interaction with the temperature and pressure (TPC). Many different interactions between the operating variables influence the proportion of furans in the liquid. Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the effect of these interactions according to the ANOVA analysis for the relative amounts of the most abundant compounds present in the liquid phase. Fig. 4 displays these effects for the proportions of carboxylic acids, monohydric and polyhydric alcohols, and aldehydes, while Fig. 5 shows these effects for the proportions of C3, C4 and cyclic ketones and furans. Specifically, the effects of the reaction temperature, employing a pressure of 38bar for W/mlactose ratios of 10 and 40gcatalystmin/glactose, feeding lactose concentrations of 1 and 10wt.%, are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 a and b, e and f, i and j, and m and n. Figs. 4 and 5 c and d, g and h, k and l, and o and p display the effects of the temperature and the W/mlactose ratio employing a pressure of 50bar when lactose solutions of 1 and 10wt.% were used, respectively. 3.3.1 Carboxylic acids Acetic and propionic acids are the most abundant carboxylic acids in the liquid phase. Propionic acid formation occurs to a lesser extent due to the higher proportion of 1-hydroxypropan-2-one hydrogenated compounds than dehydrated compounds in the liquid. Acetic acid is mainly responsible for the variations observed in the proportion of carboxylic acids during the first hour of reaction (Fig. 4a–d). Acetic acid is obtained in the final steps of routes A and B. The temperature exhibits two different effects on the proportion of carboxylic acids depending on the pressure. At 38bar an increase in the temperature leads to an initial increase in the proportion of carboxylic acids from 200 to 220°C followed by a substantial decrease between 220 and 240°C. In addition, this latter depletion strongly depends on the concentration of lactose in the feed; the lower the concentration of lactose, the sharper is the decrease observed. The temperature exerts a positive catalytic effect on the process. Therefore, between 200 and 220°C, an increase in temperature helps the formation of liquid end products. A further increase in temperature might shift their decomposition to gases. In addition, high temperatures can also partially hinder acetic acid formation as the solubility of H2 in water decreases with temperature. Conversely, at 50bar the temperature exerts a weaker effect on the relative amount of carboxylic acids. This increase in pressure kinetically enhances the acetic acid decomposition rate [25]. This effect depends on the lactose concentration. For a 1wt.% lactose solution a mild increase with temperature occurs between 200 and 220°C, followed by a small decrease from 220 to 240°C. However, this evolution with temperature is not as pronounced as it is at 38bar. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, the effect of the temperature is negligible between 200 and 220°C, while a small increase takes place with a further increase in the temperature up to 240°C. The effect of the W/mlactose on the proportion of carboxylic acids depends on the concentration of lactose, the temperature and the pressure. At 38bar the W/mlactose ratio does not significantly influence the proportion of carboxylic acids between 200 and 220°C regardless of the lactose concentration. Within this temperature range, the positive kinetic effect of the temperature can mask the effect of the W/mlactose ratio on the process and the lowest W/mlactose ratio used in this work (10gcatalystmin/glactose) might be sufficient to achieve high concentrations of acetic acid in the liquid. Between 220 and 240°C an increase in the W/mlactose ratio results in an increase in the proportion of this family of compounds for a 1wt.% lactose solution, while a decrease is observed for 10wt.%. An increase in the amount of catalyst promotes acetic acid production, which accounts for the increase observed. However, an increase in the concentration of lactose in the solution also increases the partial pressure of acetic acid inside the reactor, which kinetically favours its decomposition to gases [25]. At 50bar, the opposite effect is observed. For a diluted lactose solution, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio promotes acetic acid formation, while for a concentrated solution it favours its decomposition due to the increase in the partial pressure of the liquid intermediates [25]. In addition, the increase observed in the proportion of carboxylic acids takes places along with a decrease in C3-ketones, and vice versa. The greatest effect of the pressure on the proportion of carboxylic acids takes place between 220 and 240°C. An increase in the pressure from 38 to 50bar leads to a decrease in the proportion of carboxylic acids due to the positive kinetic effect of this variable for acetic acid decomposition [25]. 3.3.2 Alcohols: monohydric and polyhydric alcohols The variations in the relative amount of monohydric alcohols basically correspond to variations in methanol and ethanol, while the variations observed for polyhydric alcohols are accounted for by variations in the proportions of 1,2-propane-diol and 1,2-ethane-diol. The temperature has different influences on the proportion of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols depending on the lactose concentration, pressure and W/mlactose ratio, due to the large number of interactions detected between these variables. For a diluted lactose solution (1wt.%), an initial increase in the temperature from 200 to 220°C leads to an initial increase in the proportion of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols. The proportions of both families of alcohols decrease when the temperature is further increased up to 240°C regardless of the pressure and W/mlactose ratio. In addition, the increase and the decrease observed for the proportion of monohydric alcohols are sharper than for polyhydric alcohols. The temperature exerts a positive kinetic effect on lactose decomposition, which favours the production of liquid end products [25]. These results suggest that routes A and B are prevalent over route C between 200 and 220°C. This is in good agreement with the results from other works that report that sugar dehydration to produce furanic compounds is preferential at high temperatures [27,28,31,33]. A further increase in the temperature from 220 to 240°C helps the transformation of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols to gases [37,52,54,64,65]. In addition, high temperatures also potentiate dehydration reactions from lactose [27,28,31,33]. This leads to the formation of furan compounds, which favours route C over A and B. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, the effect of the temperature depends on the pressure and W/mlactose ratio. At 38bar, an increase in temperature between 200 and 220°C increases the proportion of monohydric alcohols without significantly modifying the relative amount of polyhydric alcohols in the liquid regardless of the W/mlactose ratio. A further increase up to 240°C results in a decrease in the proportion of monohydric alcohols irrespective of the W/mlactose ratio and in a decrease in the relative amount of polyhydric alcohols only when the highest W/mlactose ratio is used. An increase in the lactose concentration favours the advancement of the reactions in the liquid phase [25]. As a result, a lower temperature is required to achieve the highest proportion of polyhydric alcohols when the highest W/mlactose is used for a 10wt.% than for a 1wt.% lactose solution. In addition, an increase in the concentration of lactose produces a greater spread of sugar dehydration reactions towards furanic compounds [28]. This development produces a competition between routes A and B and route C. Therefore, a greater amount of catalyst is needed to produce the end products obtained from routes A and B. At 50bar two different trends are observed depending on the W/mlactose ratio for a 10wt.% lactose solution. When using a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in the temperature does not significantly modify the proportion of monohydric alcohols but slightly decreases the proportion of polyhydric alcohols. High temperature and pressure favours dehydration reactions from sugars [27,28,31,33], and therefore a low proportion of liquid end products obtained via routes A and B is achieved. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose, this increment in the temperature produces a sharp increase in the proportion of monohydric alcohols, without greatly modifying the proportion of polyhydric alcohols. This might account for the increase in the concentration of end products obtained from routes A and B. The pressure exerts a weaker effect on the proportions of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols than the temperature. The variations observed for the proportion of monohydric alcohols are relatively low when the system pressure increases from 38 to 50bar, while variations in polyhydric alcohols are not important from a practical point of view. The variations observed for monohydric alcohols depend on the lactose concentration. On the one hand, when a diluted lactose solution (1wt.%) is fed, an increase in pressure from 38 to 50bar slightly increases the proportion of monohydric alcohols between 200 and 215°C when a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose is used. Within this range, an increase in pressure increases the development of the reaction leading to the formation of liquid end products. This effect is only significant for a low W/mlactose ratio, as the positive kinetic effect of the catalyst can compensate for the lower amount of catalyst used, thus masking the effect of the pressure for high W/mlactose ratios. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose, this increase in pressure decreases the proportion of monohydric alcohols between 210 and 230°C. This increase in pressure kinetically enhances the decomposition of monohydric alcohols when a high amount of catalyst is used [25]. On the other hand, for a 10wt.% lactose solution, the effect of the pressure is relatively weak for 10gcatalystmin/glactose, while a moderate decrease in the proportion of monohydric alcohols is observed for 40gcatalystmin/glactose between 200 and 230°C. The effect of the W/mlactose ratio is relatively weak and depends on the pressure and lactose concentration. At 38bar, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose does not modify the proportion of monohydric alcohols when a diluted solution is used (1wt.%). Conversely, an increase in the lactose concentration makes the effect of the W/mlactose ratio significant, increasing the proportions of monohydric alcohols in the liquid. An increase in the lactose concentration makes route C prevalent over A and B, as explained above. This increase in the W/mlactose ratio increases the proportion of polyhydric alcohols between 200 and 220°C regardless of the lactose concentration due to the positive kinetic effect of the catalyst, which favours lactose decomposition. At 50bar an increase in the W/mlactose ratio decreases the proportion of monohydric alcohols between 200 and 220°C for a 1wt.% lactose solution. This depletion occurs along with an increase in the proportions of aldehydes and carboxylic acids in the liquid. Increases in the proportion of acetaldehyde and acetic acid are accounted for by these variations. The positive catalytic effect of the pressure and W/mlactose ratio helps shift the decomposition of monohydric alcohols to end liquids and gases [25]. Conversely, an increase in this family of compounds occurs between 220 and 240°C when a 10wt.% lactose solution is fed. Dehydration reactions are favoured at high temperature, pressure and using a concentrated lactose solution, which makes route C prevalent over routes A and B. Therefore, at these operating conditions under which routes A and B are not predominant, it might be necessary to use a high W/mlactose ratio to produce a greater spread of the reactions leading to the formation of end products obtained via routes A and B. In addition, the proportion of polyhydric alcohols increases between 220 and 240°C regardless of the lactose concentration due to the positive kinetic effect of the catalyst. 3.3.3 Aldehydes The relative amount of this compound in the liquid phase is low (0–12%), probably because it is one of the end products of lactose aqueous phase reforming and/or it can easily be transformed into gas in the final steps of the process [25]. The relative amount of aldehydes strongly depends on the W/mlactose ratio and the concentration of lactose in the solution. Very interestingly, the pressure (between 38 and 50bar) does not significantly influence the proportion of aldehydes in the liquid. This was also reported in a previous work analysing the effect of the pressure on the proportion of this family of compounds during the APR of crude glycerol [25]. When a 1wt.% lactose solution is fed, the liquid product has a negligible concentration of aldehydes for a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose, regardless of the pressure. Conversely, a sharp increase in the proportion of aldehydes occurs when increasing the temperature, especially between 220 and 240°C, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose within the whole interval of pressure considered (38–50bar). This increase in the proportion of aldehydes accounts for the decrease observed in the relative amount of monohydric alcohols. This development indicates that the dehydration of ethane 1,2-diol to acetaldehyde is more likely to occur than its hydrogenation to ethanol since at high temperatures H2 solubility decreases with temperature. In addition, high temperatures and W/mlactose ratios favour the advancement of the reaction in the liquid phase towards the formation of liquid products. Therefore, when a diluted lactose solution is fed, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose leads to a substantial increase in the proportion of aldehydes in the liquid. 3.3.4 Ketones: C3-ketones, C4-ketones and cyclic ketones The ketonic fraction is made up of ketones of three and four carbon atoms (C3-ketones and C4-ketones) together with cyclic ketones and, in lower proportions, furanic ketones. C3-ketones, mainly obtained from dehydration reactions, are the most abundant ketones in the liquid phase. The effect of the temperature depends on the lactose concentration and pressure. For a 1wt.% lactose solution, the proportion of C3-ketones decreases from 200 to 220°C and increases with a further increase in the temperature up to 240°C, regardless of the pressure and the W/mlactose ratio. Between 200 and 220°C an increase in temperature kinetically produces a greater spread of hydrogenation reactions in the liquid. However, the H2 solubility in water decreases with a further increase in temperature up to 240°C, thus hindering the hydrogenation of ketones to alcohols. This accounts for the increase observed in ketones and the decreases observed in the proportions of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols [25]. For this diluted lactose solution, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose leads to a decrease in the proportion of C3-ketones. This drop occurs between 200 and 230°C at 38bar and between 210 and 240°C at 50bar. These depletions account for a greater advancement of the reaction in the liquid phase towards the formation of liquid products [25]. For a 10wt.% lactose solution the effect of the temperature strongly depends on the pressure. At 38bar, the temperature does not significantly affect the proportion of C3 ketones in the liquid, and the W/mlactose ratio is only significant between 200 and 215°C, where an increase from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose slightly decreases the relative amount of C3-ketones. It is believed that the non-significant effect of the temperature is the consequence of two developments. On the one hand, between 200 and 220°C an increase in the lactose concentration increases the partial pressure of C3-ketones in the liquid, favouring their transformation towards liquid end products, thus decreasing their relative amount in the liquid. On the other hand, between 220 and 240°C the formation of furanic compounds from the dehydration of glucose and galactose through route C is favoured, decreasing the proportion of C3-ketones in the liquid. At 50bar, the effect of the temperature is not significant for a low W/mlactose ratio. However, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio up to 40gcatalystmin/glactose increases the proportion of C3-ketones at low temperatures very sharply. This increase is accounted for by the decrease in the proportion of monohydric alcohols in the liquid. For this W/mlactose ratio, an increase in the temperature results in a substantial reduction in the proportion of this family of compounds in the liquid, which accounts for the increase observed in the proportion of monohydric alcohols. The effect of the pressure on the relative amount of C3-ketones strongly depends on the temperature and lactose concentration. The effect of the pressure is minimal between 200 and 220°C, while significant variations occur between 220 and 240°C. When a 1wt.% lactose solution is used, an increase in pressure from 38 to 50bar results in an increase and a decrease in the proportion of C3-ketones for W/mlactose ratios of 10 and 40gcatalystmin/glactose, respectively, between 220 and 240°C. An increase in the total pressure raises the solubility of H2 in the liquid, which can compensate for the decrease in the solubility of this gas with the temperature when a high amount of catalyst is employed. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, the effect of the pressure depends on the W/mlactose ratio. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in the pressure from 38 to 50bar does not significantly modify the proportion of C3-ketones in the liquid. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose, this increase in pressure increases the proportion of C3-ketones in the liquid very sharply between 200 and 230°C. The chemical analysis of the liquid reveals that this increase is accounted for by a sharp increase in 1-hydroxypropan-2-one. For concentrated lactose solutions, route C is favoured over route A and B. However, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio can promote the isomerisation of glucose and galactose to fructose and the posterior retro-aldol reaction [27,29], thus increasing the presence in the liquid of initial products obtained from route A. In addition, a high W/mlactose ratio produces a greater spread of condensation and cross-polymerisation reactions from the furan compounds obtained via route C [27,28,31,33]. The proportion of C4-ketones and cyclic-ketones in the liquid phase is lower than the relative amount of C3-ketones. 2-butanone-3-hydroxy, 1-hydroxy-2-butanone and 2,3-butanedione, which are obtained from the dehydration/hydrogenation of erythritol (route B), are the most abundant C4-ketones in the liquid. The effect of the temperature on the relative amount of C4 ketones depends on the pressure and the concentration of lactose. At 38bar, the effect of the temperature depends on the concentration of lactose and the W/mlactose ratio. For a 1wt.% lactose solution and using 10gcatalystmin/glactose, the proportion of C4 ketones at low temperatures is negligible, and an increase in temperature from 200 to 240°C leads to a substantial increase in the proportion of C4-ketones. The decrease in the H2 solubility with temperature, decreasing the proliferation of hydrogenation reactions [25] of C4-ketones to alcohols, might be responsible for this increase in the proportion of C4-ketones. Conversely, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio up to 40gcatalystmin/glactose increases the proportion of C4-ketones at low temperature very sharply as the presence of a catalyst favours retro-aldol reactions [30]; thus increasing the presence of liquid products obtained via route B in the liquid. For this latter ratio, an increase in temperature decreases the proportion of C4-ketones between 200 and 220°C. A further increase in temperature up to 240°C leads to a substantial increase in the proportion of C4-ketones. At low temperature, an increase in the temperature kinetically favours hydrogenation reactions, while a further increase in temperature decreases the H2 solubility in water, thus hindering hydrogenation reactions [25]. Between 220 and 240°C an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose reduces the relative amount of C4-ketones in the liquid. At 50bar and using a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose, the effect of the temperature on the relative amount of C4-ketones in the liquid has a similar evolution regardless of the lactose concentration. The proportion of C4-ketones increases when increasing the temperature from 200 to 220°C, while a further increase in temperature up to 240°C results in a decrease in the proportion of C4-ketones. High pressure promotes retro-aldol reactions in hot compressed water [66]. Therefore at 50bar, an increase in temperature increases the proportion of C4-ketones in the liquid, which are obtained through route B due to the greater spread of glucose/galactose decomposition via retro-aldol reactions at high pressure. Conversely, for 40gcatalystmin/glactose the effect of the temperature depends on the concentration of lactose. When feeding a 1wt.% lactose solution, the concentration of C4-ketones decreases with temperature, while for a 10wt.% solution, an increase takes places as the temperature increases from 200 to 240°C. For a low lactose concentration the catalyst favours hydrogenation reactions [25], which leads to a decrease in the proportion of C4-ketones. Conversely, for a concentrated lactose solution, route C prevails over routes A and B [27,28,31,33]. Therefore, an increase in temperature might shift the retro-aldol reactions [66], which results in a liquid with a higher concentration of initial products obtained via route B. At this pressure (50bar), an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40g catalyst/min leads to a decrease in the proportion of C4-ketones regardless of the lactose concentration, as the catalyst favours the advancement of route B towards liquid end products. An increase in the pressure for a 1wt.% lactose solution has two different effects depending on the W/mlactose ratio. When a low amount of catalyst is used, an increase in pressure from 38 to 50bar increases and decreases the proportion of C4-ketones between 200 and 230°C and between 230 and 240°C, respectively. This is the consequence of two developments. High pressure promotes retro-aldol reactions in hot compressed water [66]. In addition, their subsequent transformation to end liquids is not favoured due to the low amount of catalyst, which globally results in an increase in the amount of C4-ketones in the liquid. For a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose, the same increase in pressure does not provoke great differences in the proportion of C4-ketones; the proportion slightly decreases between 200 and 240°C. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, this increase in pressure leads to a decrease in the proportion of C4-ketones between 200–215°C and 225–240°C; the effect of the pressure being negligible from 215 to 225°C. For a 10wt.% lactose solution, route C is favoured over routes A and B [27,28,31,33], which can explain the decay observed between 225 and 240°C. Cyclopentanone, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one and 2-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one are responsible for the variations observed in the proportion of cyclic ketones during the first hour of reaction. These ketones are obtained from the hydrogenation of different liquid intermediates obtained through the decomposition of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde, which is obtained from glucose/galactose dehydration (route C). The effect of the temperature depends on the pressure. On the one hand, at 38bar and regardless of the W/mlactose ratio and lactose concentration, the temperature does not significantly influence the proportion of cyclic ketones between 200 and 220°C, while an increase in the relative amount of this family of ketones occurs as the temperature increases from 220 to 240°C. The decrease in the H2 solubility with temperature might be responsible for the increase observed in this family of compounds, as this H2 limitation stops the advancement of the reaction in the liquid phase towards end products obtained through route C. In addition, high temperatures favour route C over routes A and B [27,28,31,33], which accounts for the increase in this family of compounds and the decreases observed in the proportions of carboxylic acids and monohydric alcohols. At this pressure (38bar), an increase in the W/mlactose ratio from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose increases the concentration of cyclic ketones in the liquid. The W/mlactose ratio does not significantly modify the proportion of cyclic ketones in the liquid for a diluted lactose solution. However, the higher the lactose concentration, the greater is the impact of the W/mlactose ratio on the proportion of this family of ketones. On the other hand, at 50bar the effect of the temperature depends on the W/mlactose ratio and lactose concentration. For a 1wt.% lactose solution, the proportion of cyclic ketones sharply decreases when increasing the temperature from 200 to 220°C and a liquid free of cyclic ketones is obtained between 220 and 240°C. For a low W/mlactose ratio this decrease accounts for the increase in the proportion of C3-ketones, while for a high W/mlactose ratio the sharp increase in the relative amount of furans in the liquid is responsible for the decrease in the proportion of cyclic ketones. For a 10wt.% lactose solution two different trends are observed depending on the W/mlactose ratio. Between 200 and 220°C, the proportion of cyclic ketones drops when increasing the temperature for 10gcatalystmin/glactose. Within this temperature interval the proportion of cyclic ketones is negligible for a W/mlactose ratio of 40gcatalystmin/glactose. Between 220 and 240°C, the W/mlactose ratio does not influence the proportion of cyclic ketones, and an increase in the relative amount of cyclic ketones occurs as the reaction temperature increases regardless of the W/mlactose ratio. The increase observed in the CC gas between 220 and 240°C might be responsible for this development. An increase in temperature favours the evolution of the intermediate liquid compounds obtained from route A and B towards gases [25], thus increasing the proportion of liquids obtained from route C. This transformation is favoured at high pressure [25]. In addition, the decrease in the H2 solubility with temperature might be responsible for the increase observed in this family of compounds. The effect of the pressure depends on the concentration of lactose, the temperature and the W/mlactose ratio. When a diluted lactose solution (1wt.%) is fed, an increase in pressure from 38 to 50bar increases the proportion of cyclic ketones between 200 and 220°C and reduces their relative amount between 220 and 240°C, regardless of the W/mlactose ratio. At low temperatures route C is not favoured, and an increase in the pressure increases the partial pressure of H2, which promotes hydrogenation reactions to produce cyclic ketones. Conversely, between 220 and 240°C an increase in pressure favours the formation of C3-ketones and furans. When a 10wt.% lactose solution is fed, the effect of the pressure is only significant between 200 and 220°C, an interval under which two different evolutions are observed depending on the W/mlactose ratio. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose, the pressure does not greatly influence the proportion of cyclic ketones in the liquid, while for 40gcatalystmin/glactose this increase in pressure results in a decrease in the proportion of this family of ketones in the liquid product. 3.3.5 Furans Furanic compounds, mainly 5-hydroxymethil-2-furancarboxaldehyde, 5-methyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde and furfural, are obtained from the dehydration of glucose and galactose via route C. The proportion of this family of compounds in the liquid is relatively low. Exceptionally, the proportion of furans in the liquid dramatically increases with temperature at high pressure and employing a high W/mlactose ratio for a diluted lactose solution. The effect of the temperature on the relative amount of furans strongly depends on the pressure. At 38bar, the proportion of furans in the liquid is very low. For 10gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in the temperature from 200 to 220°C slightly increases their proportion in the liquid, while a further increase in the temperature up to 240°C leads to a decrease in the relative amount of this family of compounds. Between 220 and 240°C the CC liq decreases and the CC sol increases very sharply as high temperatures promote the polymerisation and aldol-condensation reactions of furans [27,28,31,33]. At this pressure an increase from 10 to 40gcatalystmin/glactose reduces the proportion of furans regardless of the lactose concentration for the whole temperature interval considered, probably due to the greater spread of polymerisation and condensation reactions from furans [27,28,31,33] which might help the advancement of the reactions occurring via route C. At 50bar, the concentration of furans in the liquid depends on the lactose concentration and the W/mlactose ratio. When a low amount of catalyst is used, the proportion of furans in the liquid is very low and the effect of the temperature is very weak. Conversely, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio has a great impact on the proportion of furans when diluted lactose solutions are used. Specifically, for a 1wt.% lactose solution and 40gcatalystmin/glactose, an increase in temperature from 200 to 240°C increases the proportion of furans very sharply. This increase in the temperature also increases the CC sol as described above, suggesting that under these operating conditions the glucose and galactose dehydration is favoured, thus increasing the amount of liquids produced via route C. An increase in the concentration of lactose in the solution can potentiate the condensation and polymerisation of furans, thus decreasing their relative amount in the liquid [27,28,31,33]. As a result, a negligible concentration of furans is obtained with a 10wt.% lactose solution using 40gcatalystmin/glactose. The effect of the pressure depends on the lactose concentration and W/mlactose ratio. When a W/mlactose ratio of 10gcatalystmin/glactose is used, an increase in pressure from 38 to 50bar reduces the proportion of furans regardless of the lactose concentration. An increase in the system pressure favours the advancement of the reactions leading to the formation of end products [25]. Conversely, an increase in the W/mlactose ratio modifies the effect of the pressure. The proportion of furans augments when the W/mlactose ratio increases and decreases when increasing the concentration of lactose in the solution."
10,Prediction of optimal operating conditions within the range of study,"3.4 Prediction of optimal operating conditions within the range of study Optimal conditions for gas and liquid production were sought for this process, making use of the experimental models developed. The predicted R2 of all the models is higher than 0.90, allowing their use for prediction purposes. Four different optimisations were carried out. The first aims at the production of a gas with a high H2 content, and therefore comprises the maximisation of the CC gas and the relative amount of H2 in the gas. The second, third and fourth seek to maximise the production of alcohols (monohydric and polyhydric alcohols), ketones and furans, respectively. Therefore, the CC liq and the proportion of each family of liquids were maximised. In addition, the CC sol was minimised for all the optimisations. To meet these objectives, a solution that strikes a compromise between the optimum values for all the response variables was sought. To do this, a relative importance (from 1 to 5) was given to each of the objectives in order to come up with the solution that satisfies all the criteria. To globally maximise gas and liquid production, a relative importance of 5 was assigned to the CC gas and CC liq, while a relative importance of 3 was given to the properties of the gas or liquid (vol. H2 and relative amount of each family of compound) and to the minimisation of the CC sol in all cases. Table 1 lists the optimisation results. Taking these restrictions into account, optimisation 1 predicts a possible optimum for H2 production at the highest values of the temperature, pressure, lactose concentration and W/mlactose ratio used in this work. Under these conditions 4mol H2/mol lactose is produced. This H2 yield is similar to that obtained in anaerobic fermentation (4mol H2/mol lactose) and anaerobic fermentation plus photo-fermentation with l-malic acid (2–10mol H2/mol lactose), but lower than the H2 yield obtained during the catalytic steam reforming of lactose (16mol H2/mol lactose) [67]. The production of value-added liquids (optimisations 2, 3 and 4) is favoured when feeding a diluted lactose solution (1wt.%). Specifically, optimisation 2 indicates that the production of alcohols is preferential at medium temperature and medium pressure, using a low W/mlactose ratio. Under these conditions the proportions of monohydric and polyhydric alcohols in the liquid are 26 and 17%, respectively. Optimisation 3 predicts a selective production of C3-ketones at high temperature and pressure, using a low amount of catalyst. Under these conditions, the hydrogen solubility in the liquid is relatively low. This hinders hydrogenation reactions, thus increasing the proportion of C3-ketones in the liquid. Optimisation 4 predicts a maximum for the proportion of furans at medium temperature and high pressure using a high W/mlactose ratio."
11,Conclusions,"Aqueous phase reforming turned out to be a highly customisable process for the valorisation of lactose, the major organic constituent of cheese whey, for the production of either gas or liquid value-added chemicals. The operating variables exert a significant influence on the global results of the aqueous phase reforming (carbon converted into gas, liquid and solid products) as well as on the composition of the gas and liquid phases. The gas phase is composed of H2, CO2, CO and CH4. The liquid phase consisted of a mixture of aldehydes, carboxylic acids, monohydric alcohols, polyhydric-alcohols, C3, C4 and cyclic-ketones and furans. The optimisation of the process revealed that an elevated temperature and a high pressure favour gas production when using a high W/mlactose ratio and a concentrated lactose solution. Liquid production is favoured at high temperature using a diluted lactose solution and a low W/mlactose ratio. An elevated temperature and a high W/mlactose ratio favour solid production due to the proliferation of condensation and polymerisation reactions."
