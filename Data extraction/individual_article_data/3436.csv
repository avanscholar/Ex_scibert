0,Introduction,"The photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of organics is attractive for the immediate production of medicines and polymers. [1–3] This process can proceed under mild conditions without other additives [3]. During the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, the photocatalysts absorb the photons under light irradiation with the generation of excited electrons and holes [2]. Then the hydrogen donors, like alcohols, are oxidized by these excited holes over photocatalysts [4,5]. The generated protons can interact with excited electrons and organic substrates to obtain the desired products [6,7]. Meanwhile, these protons also can be directly reduced by the excited electrons for the H2 evolution. [8] The formation of H2 is considered to be competitive with the transfer hydrogenation of organics to consume the limited amount of excited electrons over photocatalysts. [6] Therefore, the rational design of photocatalysts is necessary to control the reaction pathway for producing the desired products [9]. The Pt species are typical co-catalysts and active sites in photocatalytic reduction. [6,10] The chemical states of Pt species play an important role in the selectivity of products [11]. For instance, the positively charged Pt (Ptδ+) species suppress the reversible oxidation of hydrogen species. [10,12] Meanwhile, the Pt–H species over Ptδ+ sites favor the reduction of organics rather than H2 evolution. [6] These results suggest that the design and preparation of photocatalysts with active PtOx sites are available. [13] Previously, these Ptδ+ species can be stabilized by alloying with other noble metals or coordinating with organic ligands. [2,6,10,14] In particular, the metal oxides acting as the support may provide the oxygen atoms for the stabilization of Ptδ+ species without any metal additives or ligands. [15] However, the application of this approach is rarely studied in the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of organics [15]. Among various metal oxides, niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) is a credible candidate for support. [16–24] Suitable redox ability for organic transformation is observed over non-toxic Nb2O5 [25]. Moreover, available transport of oxygen atoms is observed over two-dimensional (2D) Nb2O5, indicating that Ptδ+ species are potentially stabilized in Pt–O–Nb structure. [26,27] Thus, we may control the reaction pathways between H2 evolution and hydrogen transfer reduction of organics by the modification of Pt species via the design of support (Fig. 1 ). However, the preparation of Pt species supported on 2D Nb2O5 catalysts is complicated. [25] Generally, 2D Nb2O5 catalysts are synthesized from the exfoliation of layered niobate precursors with corrosive agents. [25] After that, the Pt species are introduced into Nb2O5 via impregnation or photo-deposition. [25] Thus, the efficient approach to prepare such Nb2O5-based catalysts is still desirable. Herein, we reported a method of one-step calcination to prepare the Ptδ+ species on 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates (designated as Pt/Nb2O5-A) from the mixture of ammonium niobate (V) oxalate, chloroplatinic acid, and melamine. Without the addition of melamine, metallic Pt (Pt0) species over bulk Nb2O5 (Pt/Nb2O5) were obtained. In the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, the dominant products were styrene and H2 over Pt/Nb2O5-A and Pt/Nb2O5, respectively (Fig. 1). In these processes, we defined internal hydrogen efficiency (IHE) to evaluate the utilization of hydrogen species in the reduction of phenylacetylene (as shown in the experimental section, equation 3). The IHE over Pt/Nb2O5-A was ca. 60 ∼ 80 %, which was significantly higher than that of Pt/Nb2O5 (ca. 20 ∼ 40 %). The influence of support on the chemical states of Pt species was revealed by the results of Fourier transform infrared spectra using CO as the probe molecule, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."

3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of Nb2O5, Nb2O5-A, Pt/Nb2O5, and Pt/Nb2O5-A In a typical procedure, 1.0 g ammonium niobate (V) oxalate, 1.0 g melamine, and 1.0 mL ethanol solution of H2PtCl6·xH2O (10 mg mL−1) and 9.0 g ethanol were mixed and magnetically stirred for 12 h. A sol-gel precursor was obtained in this process. Then the mixture was dried by rotary evaporation and further treated at 45 °C in a vacuum oven. After that, the mixture was ground into a powder and placed in a homemade vertical tube. The sample was calcinated at 550 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.5 °C min-1 at room temperature under air condition (30 mL min−1). After cooling to room temperature, the obtained catalyst was ground into a powder and designated as Pt/Nb2O5-A. For comparison, the sample prepared without melamine was denoted as Pt/Nb2O5. The sample prepared from ammonium niobate (V) oxalate under the same process was denoted as Nb2O5. The sample prepared from ammonium niobate (V) oxalate and melamine under the same process was denoted as Nb2O5-A. The Pt/Nb2O5-A was further treated at 350 °C for 2 h under hydrogen condition (30 mL min−1). The obtained catalyst was denoted as Pt/Nb2O5-AR."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline structures of Pt/Nb2O5 catalysts were measured by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, using a PANalytical X-Pert PRO diffractometer. The morphology of obtained catalysts and sizes of Pt species were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope. Light absorption ability of Pt/Nb2O5 catalysts and corresponding bandgap were analyzed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) on Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer. [18] XPS analysis was performed at Thermofisher Excalab X+, in which the binding energy was calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The contents of Pt in Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) analysis using Shimadzu ICPS-8100. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) of Pt/Nb2O5 catalysts was performed on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. In addition, the information of Pt species was analyzed by CO adsorbed Fourier transform infrared (CO-FTIR) spectra that were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument. [28] Typically, the catalyst sample was placed in a homemade infrared cell in a closed glass-circulation system. The sample was heated to 150 °C for 30 min. and subsequently cooled to room temperature. Then the sample was treated with the flow of argon gas for more than 30 min.. After that, background spectra were collected. Then the sample was treated with the flow of CO gas for 30 min.. After that, the flow of CO gas was replaced by Ar gas to remove the physically absorbed CO. The desorption spectra were collected at different exposure times to study the interaction between CO and the Pt/Nb2O5 catalysts."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test Photocatalytic reactions were conducted in homemade photoreactors under LED light irradiation. [18] Typically, 10 mg of the photocatalyst was placed in a homemade quartz tube with a magnetic stirrer, followed by the addition of 0.1 mmol of phenylacetylene dissolved in ethanol (1 mL). The atmosphere in the reaction tube was replaced by argon [1]. This system was irradiated with 365 nm light illumination for the desired reaction time under stirring. CAUTIOUS! In this process, an eye goggle is necessary to avoid eye injuries from 365 nm light. [29] The temperature was detected in the range of 20 ∼ 30 °C. When the reaction was accomplished, the gas product was firstly quantified. The helium as standard was injected into the reaction tube. [1] Then the generated H2 was quantified by gas chromatography (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD, Techcomp 7900). [1] After that, dodecane as the internal standard was added to the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture was filtered for further analysis. The amount of phenylacetylene, styrene, and ethylbenzene was quantified by GC-FID (Agilent 7890A). The conversion of phenylacetylene and IHE were calculated by the following equation (equation 1): Conversion (%) = (1 - amount of phenylacetylene after the reaction amount of phenylacetylene before the reaction ) × 100% The internal hydrogen efficiency (IHE) was defined as the following equation (equation 2): IHE = ∑ amount of products from the transfer hydrogenation process ∑ amount of products from the transfer hydrogenation process and amount of H 2 × 100% In the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, the IHE over different catalysts was calculated by the following equation (equation 3): IHE = n styrene +2n(ethylbenzene) n styrene +2n ethylbenzene +n H 2 × 100%"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure of catalysts,"3.1 Structure of catalysts To analyze the nanostructure, the morphologies of obtained Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A catalysts were measured by TEM (Fig. 2 a-d, and S1), respectively. Bulk Nb2O5 was observed over Pt/Nb2O5 sample (Fig. 2a). Especially, 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates were observed over Pt/Nb2O5-A (Fig. 2c, and S1e-f). These results indicate that melamine as a template is conducive to the formation of nanoplates when chloroplatinic acid was also present in the precursor. As shown in Fig. 2b and 2d, the average spacing of lattice fringes (d1 and d2) of Pt species was c.a. 0.227 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of cubic Pt. [12] Meanwhile, the Pt species were dispersed irregularly on Nb2O5 supports with sizes of c.a. 5 ∼ 25 nm (Fig. 2e). Besides, other lattice fringes were observed, in which the average spacing (d3) is c.a. 0.393 nm. The crystalline structure of as-synthesized catalysts was further characterized by XRD (Fig. 2f). Similar diffraction peaks over Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A at 2θ of 22.6°, 28.4°, 36.7°, 46.2°, 51.0°, 55.2°, 56.1°, and 59.0°, could be attributed to the (001), (100), (101), (002), (110), (102), (111), and (200) planes, respectively. [30,31] These diffraction peaks suggest the same pseudohexagonal structure of Nb2O5 (TT-Nb2O5, JCPDS card no. 28-0317) on Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A, implying that the melamine, as a template, plays a marginal role in the crystal structure of Pt/Nb2O5-A. [30] These results indicate the lattice fringes with 0.393 nm spacing are corresponding to the (001) plane of TT-Nb2O5 [21]. Additionally, a peak at 2θ of 39.8° was observed for as-synthesized catalysts, corresponding to the Pt(111) lattice plane [32]. This result was consistent with the TEM results. Furthermore, the Pt contents of all samples were quantified by ICP-AES. The Pt content (1.1 wt%, Table S1) of Pt/Nb2O5-A was similar to that of Pt/Nb2O5 (1.0 wt%). Due to the thickness change of the support, the optical properties of catalysts may be different. [33] The band structures of the obtained catalysts were analyzed by UV–vis DRS (Fig. 3 a-b). Both samples showed the absorption capacity of UV light. Compared to the Pt/Nb2O5, Pt/Nb2O5-A exhibited a blue shift of the absorption edge, implying its enlarged bandgap. [33] The bandgaps of Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A were 3.22 eV and 3.38 eV (Fig. 3b), respectively. Similar, the bandgap of Nb2O5-A is wider than that of Nb2O5 (Fig. S2). These results indicate that the broad bandgap of Pt/Nb2O5-A is mainly ascribed to the quantum confinement effect caused by the formation of the nanoplates. [34] Combined with the results of TEM images, these results suggest that the Pt species were loaded on Nb2O5 nanoplates by a one-step calcination approach. The chemical states of Nb and O of Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A were investigated by XPS. As shown in Fig. 3c, the high-resolution spectra of O 1s of all samples could be deconvoluted into two peaks around 530.0 eV and 531.5 eV, corresponding to lattice oxygen atoms, and surface adsorbed oxygen species, respectively. [27,35] The high-resolution spectra of Nb 3d of all samples could be deconvoluted into two peaks around 207.1 eV, and 209.8 eV (Figs. 3d), corresponding to Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 spectra line, respectively. [36] These results are consistent with the chemical states of Nb2O5 in previous reports. [35,36] Especially, the Nb 3d5/2 region over Pt/Nb2O5-A was centered at 207.0 eV and lower than that of Pt/Nb2O5, implying more Nb4+ and oxygen vacancies over Pt/Nb2O5-A (Fig. 3d). [36] This structure suggests the potential interaction of Pt species and Nb2O5 nanoplates. The chemical states of Pt species over Pt/Nb2O5 catalysts were analyzed by the results of XPS and CO-FTIR spectra. Two peaks around 70.4 eV and 73.8 eV were observed over Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A (Figure S3). These peaks could be assigned to the metallic Pt (Pt0) species. [4,13] Besides, the chemical states and stability of Pt species in all catalysts were further analyzed by the CO-FTIR spectra. CO molecule is a typical reductant that probes the oxidation states of Pt species when adsorbs and interacts with Pt nanoparticles [37]. After the adsorption of CO gas for 30 min., the residual CO in the gas phase and along with that physically adsorbs on Pt/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5-A samples were removed by the purging argon gas. As shown in Fig. 4 a-b, the adsorption peaks at c.a. 2170 cm−1 and 2120 cm−1 are attributed to the gas-phase CO molecules. [32] When the desorption time was prolonged to 100 min., only the peak at 2076 cm−1 was observed over Pt/Nb2O5 (Fig. 4a), ascribed to the adsorption of CO molecules on Pt0 species. [38] Especially, another peak at 2093 cm−1 was observed over Pt/Nb2O5-A, which was attributed to CO on the positively charged Pt (Ptδ+) species (Fig. 4b). [32] When the desorption time increased from 100 min. to 180 min., the peak at 2093 cm−1 was still present, indicating the stable Ptδ+ species under CO atmosphere (Fig. 4b). [32] This phenomenon may be ascribed to the stabilization of Ptδ+ species by 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates. Notably, the Ptδ+ species were not observed on XPS spectra may be due to the strong reduction potential of the electrons in XPS. [6] Furthermore, the results of H2-TPR are feasible to reveal the possible interaction between Pt species and Nb2O5 samples. As shown in Fig. 4c-d, the reduction temperatures of surface and interior Nb–O–Nb species were higher than 350 °C over Nb2O5 and Nb2O5-A. Furthermore, the reduction temperature of interior Nb–O–Nb species was much higher than that of surface Nb–O–Nb species. [39] As shown in Fig. 4c, three peaks at 460 °C, 503 °C, and 599 °C were observed over Nb2O5. After the introduction of Pt species on bulk Nb2O5, only two peaks around 333 °C and 599 °C were observed (Fig. 4c). In previous, the reduction temperature of Pt–O–Nb species was lower than 350 °C. [40] Therefore, the peaks at 333 °C, 460 ∼ 503 °C, and 599 °C can be attributed to the reduction of the Pt–O–Nb, surface Nb–O–Nb, and interior Nb–O–Nb species [41]. Similarly, the peaks at 356 ∼ 434 °C and 637 °C were observed over Nb2O5-A (Fig. 4d). After the introduction of Pt species on Nb2O5-A, only two peaks around 323 °C and 637 °C were observed (Fig. 4d), which are assigned to reduction of Pt–O–Nb and interior Nb–O–Nb species, respectively. [41] By comparing of H2-TPR results of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5-A, the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy on 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates led to the decreased reduction temperature of surface Nb–O–Nb species (356 °C and 434 °C) on the Nb2O5-A sample. [42] After the introduction of the Pt species, the peak intensity at 637 °C decreased significantly (Fig. 4d). These results indicated the migration of oxygen atoms from the interior structure over 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates to the surface Pt–O–Nb structure. [42] However, the peak intensity at 599 °C over Pt/Nb2O5 was close to that of the Nb2O5 sample (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the reduction temperature of Pt–O–Nb species over Pt/Nb2O5-A (323 °C) was lower than that over Pt/Nb2O5 (333 °C), suggesting much stronger transportability of the interior oxygen species over Pt/Nb2O5-A than that over Pt/Nb2O5 in the preparation process (Fig. 4d). [42] Accordingly, Pt species were stabilized in the Ptδ+ species over Pt/Nb2O5-A."
8,Photocatalytic reduction of phenylacetylene,"3.2 Photocatalytic reduction of phenylacetylene Herein, the performance of as-synthesized catalysts in the photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene in ethanol was evaluated under UV light (365 nm). As shown in Fig. 5 a, the amount of H2 product was much higher than that of styrene and ethylbenzene over Pt/Nb2O5 within 14 h of light irradiation. In contrast, the amount of styrene was much higher than that of H2 over Pt/Nb2O5-A (Fig. 5b). In order to evaluate the hydrogen efficiency, the IHE was defined and calculated according to equation 3 in the reduction of phenylacetylene (Fig. 5c). The IHE over Pt/Nb2O5-A (ca. 60 ∼ 80 %) was much higher than that over Pt/Nb2O5 (ca. 20 ∼ 40 %). These results suggest the reduction of phenylacetylene was dominated over the Pt/Nb2O5-A, while the H2 evolution was tended to proceed over the Pt/Nb2O5. The stability of the photocatalysts is vital for their potential application. [43] The recycling experiments of Pt/Nb2O5-A showed a slight decrease in the amount of generated styrene and H2 for five runs (Fig. S4a). Particularly, IHE over reused Pt/Nb2O5-A was still maintaining around 70 % (Fig. S4b) in this process, implying the robust structure of Pt/Nb2O5-A in the photocatalytic process. Additionally, the reduction of phenylacetylene was observed over other catalysts (Fig. 5d). The yield of styrene was 8% with trace H2 over Nb2O5-A (Fig. 5d), indicating the potential reduction of alkyne over pure Nb2O5-A. When the reaction time was extended from 10 h to 18 h, the yield of styrene was 9% (Fig. S5a), suggesting the inactivation of Nb2O5-A. The excited holes (h+) on Nb2O5-A can be consumed by ethanol under light irradiation. [25] Although phenylacetylene is possibly reduced by excited electrons (e−) and protons, the electrons are easily accumulated on pure Nb2O5-A, leading to the reduction and inactivation of the catalyst. [16] No styrene or H2 were observed over Pt/Nb2O5-A under dark conditions, indicating that the reaction is a photocatalytic process (Fig. 5d). The morphology of support may affect phenylacetylene absorption. [44] However, the amount of residual phenylacetylene in the solution was almost the same over different supports (Fig. S5b), implying the negligible effect of morphology [45]. Moreover, the Pt/Nb2O5-AR was obtained from Pt/Nb2O5-A by the reduction under the hydrogen atmosphere. The amount of H2 product was higher than that of styrene over Pt/Nb2O5-AR (Fig. 5d). The IHE over Pt/Nb2O5-AR (c.a. 49 %) was lower than that over Pt/Nb2O5-A (c.a. 74 %), indicating the Ptδ+ species play a vital role in the enhanced transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene (Fig. S6a-b). As mentioned above, it is a feasible strategy to control the dominant products by modification of Pt species via the supports."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, a strategy by support-induced modification of Pt species was proposed to control the dominant products in the photoreduction of organics. In the photocatalytic hydrogen transfer reduction of phenylacetylene, the dominant products were styrene and H2 over Pt/2D Nb2O5 nanoplates and Pt/bulk Nb2O5, respectively. As revealed by the results of XPS, H2-TPR, and CO-FTIR spectra, the presence of Ptδ+ species is critical for the photoreduction of phenylacetylene instead of H2 evolution. We further confirmed the interaction between Ptδ+ species and 2D Nb2O5 nanoplates is via available transport of the oxygen atoms in the preparation process. This support-induced modification strategy presented here may contribute to the development of an efficient photocatalytic system and the application of Nb-based photocatalysts."
