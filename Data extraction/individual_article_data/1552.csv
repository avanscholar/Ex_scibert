0,Introduction,"Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), one of the key basic processes in the fields of photochemistry, photophysics and photobiology, exists widely in nature [1–8]. The large Stokes shift between the absorption and tautomer emission [9], which is a critical property of ESIPT fluorophores, was first observed by Weller and co-workers in 1956 [10–12]. It produces a wide spectral window that avoids self-absorption and inner filter effects, thereby improving fluorescence analysis [13,14]. The ultrafast rate of ESIPT (KESIPT > 1012 s−1) [15] and the facile reversion between alcohol-ketone isomers [2,9] is highly attractive. Due to these beneficial characteristics, compounds exhibiting ESIPT are used for molecular logic gates [16–18], fluorescence sensors [19–22], organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) [23–28], and the like. ESIPT molecules have been widely used in various avenues of science and continue to be a subject of intensive research [29]. Most ESIPT reactions are carried out on the basis of hydrogen bond wires composed of the protonic acid groups and the adjacent basic sites [10]. Hydrogen bonds are weak electrostatic interactions. Inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonding are ubiquitous in molecules [30]. Hydrogen bonding can be remarkable enhanced in the electronic excited states, which are found wide acceptance and confirmation in the research community [31–36]. Hydrogen bonding bridges the ESPIT process and hence has a marked effect on it. Since hydrogen bonds are site-specific [37,38], it is facile to generate the intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between solutes and protic solvents [4,39,40]. Such intermolecular hydrogen bonds break the intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby impeding ESIPT processes. Alcohols are considered special polar protic solvents. They are both strong hydrogen bond donors and receptors, and can easily form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with fluorophores [41]. Methanol is a widely used alcohol found as a contaminant in biodiesel. Excess methanol is known to accelerate engine aging, which makes the development of methods for rapid and accurate monitoring of methanol content in bio-diesel highly desirable during industrial production. Recently, a novel fluorescent probe was designed by Wang et al., namely, 2-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-3-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-4Hchromen-4-one (HOF), which shows the ESIPT characteristics and was employed in the detection of methanol [42]. HOF shows two well-separated emission peaks in general organic solvents, but only a single emission peak in pure methanol. The alcohol-specific sensing of HOF is attributed to the formation of new intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between HOF and methanol that interrupt ESIPT processes. The configuration of hydrogen bond complexes varies in different solvents, depending on the number of solvent molecules interacting with HOF. Although the use of HOF is well known, the interaction mechanism between hydrogen bonds of the HOF system is not well understood. We sought to provide a more reasonable theoretical support of HOF alcohol sensing and its ESIPT mechanism. In such an endeavor a study of the hydrogen bonding dynamics of HOF in different solvents is of prime significance. The limitation of spectroscopic techniques used to direct reveal photophysical and photochemical properties is regrettable. In light of this, we chose the reliable DFT and TDDFT approaches for studying the excited state dynamics of HOF [43]. We put forward theoretical views on the ESIPT reaction of HOF in an aprotic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and protic solvents (methanol) and studied its excited state dynamics behavior. We obtained the geometric structures of HOF and its hydrogen bond complex in ground (S0) and the first excited (S1) states. Moreover, the infrared (IR) vibrations, absorption and emission spectra, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and potential energy curves (PECs) are employed to investigate the hydrogen bond interactions. To make the hydrogen bond interactions more intuitive, the reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis and topological analysis are also obtained by using Multiwfn program [44]."
1,Theoretical methods,"All ab initio calculations were carried out by utilizing Gaussian 16 suite [45]. The geometric structures of the HOF system in S0 and S1 states were optimized without any constraints by employing the DFT and TDDFT methods [30,46], respectively. To select the most suitable functional, a series of functionals were tested, including B3LYP-D3(BJ) [47], M06-2X and PBE0-D3(BJ) [48–50]. Dispersion is integral to the description of hydrogen bond interactions. However, the traditional DFT functional cannot accurately describe dispersion. To account for this, the inclusion of dispersion correction (DFT-D) was necessary in the ab initio calculation to achieve a good description of dispersion [51–53]. The calculated results of the UV–visible spectra of HOF are presented in Table 1 . A review of the experimental literature indicates that PBE0 is a competent functional for calculating the properties of HOF in the excited state. In the present study, the triple-zeta valence quality with one set of polarization functions (TZVP) [54] is deemed to be an excellent basis set for a broad variety of organic compounds. Consequently, PBE0 functional and TZVP basis set were then used to perform all ab initio calculations in this work. Additionally, we chose the polarizable continuum model (PCM) [55–57] to better explore solvent effects for toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol and methanol [58–60]. Among these, we focused on the reaction characteristics of HOF in DMSO and methanol. Frequency vibration analysis shows that all frequencies are positive, which indicates all optimized molecular structures are in the local minimum. The PECs showing the energy change trend of the ESIPT reaction in S0 and S1 states were obtained by scanning the corresponding O-H bond length."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Optimization of geometric structures,"3.1 Optimization of geometric structures DMSO and methanol were chosen as two representative solvents to discuss hydrogen bonding interactions. The atoms relevant to hydrogen bonds are numerically labeled as shown in Fig. 1 to describe expediently the following results. Hydrogen bonds at three different sites, namely HB1, HB2, and HB3, are considered. HB1 represents the interaction of O1-H1 in HOF with the O3 atom in methanol, and HB2 denotes the interaction of the O2 atom in HOF and O4-H3 in methanol. HB3 is the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction of two methanol molecules. Three geometric configurations of HOF optimized in DMSO solvent, including enol form (HOF-E), keto form (HOF-K) and open form (HOF-O), are shown in Fig. 1. Related bond lengths and angles are collected in Table 2 . The distance of O1-H1 in HOF-E is obviously longer than that in HOF-O, indicating that HOF-E forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond (O1-H1⋯O2) in S0 state. The distances of O1-H1 and H1⋯O2 in S0 state for HOF-E are 0.977 Å and 1.970 Å, while their distances in S1 state are 0.995 Å and 1.811 Å. The internuclear increases in the distance of O1-H1 and the decreases in the internuclear distance of H1⋯O2 from S0 to S1 states indicate that the O1-H1⋯O2 is enhanced in S1 state. The O1-H1⋯O2 bond angle increases from 120.2° in S0 state to 126.0° in S1 state. These data provide more evidence for the conclusions that the excited O1-H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond is enhanced, which provides the driving force for ESIPT process, thus the proton transfer reaction is more likely in S1 state. For HOF-K in S0 state, the distances of O1⋯H1 and H1-O2 are 1.809 Å and 0.998 Å, while their distances in S1 state are 1.942 Å and 0.982 Å, respectively, and are comparable to the corresponding bond length parameters of HOF-E. However, the O1⋯H1-O2 bond angle decreases from 125.2° in S0 state to 120.5° in S1 state. It can then be concluded that the O1⋯H1-O2 is weak in S1 state and more stable in S0 state. Accordingly, the reverse proton transfer of HOF is easier to occur in S0 state. In addition, O1-H1 and C=O2 groups can act as proton donor and acceptor in methanol lead to the loss of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding chelate ring. The HOF-methanol complex (HOF-2M) is shown in Fig. 1, and its geometric parameters are listed in Table 3 . The optimized results indicate the lack of a stable keto structure of HOF-2M. The variation of hydrogen bond parameters may be analyzed to give a reasonable explanation. The O1-H1 bond distances are 2.352 Å and 2.309 Å in S0 and S1 states, while the O1-H1⋯O2 bond angles are only 102.3° and 103.8°, respectively. The O1-H1⋯O2 clearly disappears in HOF-2M. In the absence of the hydrogen bonding bridge, the ESIPT process is naturally inhibited. With regard to HOF-2M, the lengths of O1-H1, O3-H2 and O4-H3 increase from 0.995 Å, 0.983 Å and 0.979 Å in S0 state to 1.005 Å, 0.985 Å and 0.993 Å in S1 state, respectively. At the same time, that of H1⋯O3, H2⋯O4, H3⋯O2 decrease from 1.703 Å, 1.748 Å and 1.723 Å in S0 state to 1.663 Å, 1.728 Å and 1.626 Å in S1 state, respectively, which indicate that intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HB1, HB2 and HB3) of HOF-2M system are stronger in S1 state than S0 state. In conclusion, all of the data analyses sufficiently confirmed that the ESIPT reaction cannot be performed in the HOF-2M system. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds impede the process of ESIPT reaction."
4,IR vibration analysis,"3.2 IR vibration analysis The change in hydrogen bond strength is correlated to the shift of IR vibration spectral peaks of the chemical bonds associated with the hydrogen bond [61,62]. The IR spectra of HOF in the O1-H1 and H1-O2 region stretching bands in S0 and S1 states are displayed in Fig. 2 . In the enol form of HOF, O1 and H1 are bonded to each other, whereas in the keto form, H1 is bonded to O2. For O1-H1, its stretching vibration frequency changes from 3447 cm−1 in S0 state to 3161 cm−1 in S1 state, which obviously shows a redshift of 286 cm−1, suggesting that O1-H1⋯O2 is enhanced in S1 state. A similar comparison is made for H1-O2, whose stretching vibration frequency is shifted from 3126 to 3376 cm−1 by electron excitation. The blue-shift of 250 cm−1 is a good reflection of the fact that the O1⋯H1-O2 in HOF-K is stronger in S0 state than in S1 state, which is conducive to the occurrence of reverse proton transfer in S0 state. The corresponding IR vibration spectra of the HOF-2M system are illustrated in Fig. 2 (c). The vibration frequencies of O1-H1, O3-H2 and O4-H3 are almost identical in S0 and S1 states. Moreover, the strength of HB1, HB2, and HB3 from the S0 to S1 states does not vary much."
5,Frontier molecular orbitals,"3.3 Frontier molecular orbitals The FMOs shown in Fig. 3 are an intuitive way of analyzing electron density distributions. The electronic excitation energy, composition and oscillator strengths for the enol form of HOF and HOF-2M are presented in Table 4 . Only the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are depicted in Fig. 3. Although the orbital transition contribution from the S0 to S2 states in HOF and HOF-2M reach 89.06% and 92.41%, their oscillator strengths are far smaller than the S1 state, that is to say, S2 state would not be further explained by us. The transitions from HOMOs to LUMOs of the HOF and the HOF-2M exhibit π-π* features according to the orbital diagram. Electronic excitation energy of HOF-E is 406 nm, and electronic excitation energy of HOF-2M is 413 nm. It exist a red shift of 7 nm. A smaller energy gap indicates a greater red shift in the absorption spectra. The energy gap of HOF-2M is slightly smaller than that of HOF, which is in consistence with the small red shift in the absorption spectra. Notably, the electron density of O1 atom of HOF decreases, while that of O2 atom increases from HOMO to LUMO, which greatly promotes the attraction of the O2 atom to the H1 atom. Apparently, charge transfer enhances the O1-H1⋯O2 and provides a powerful driving force for ESIPT. The MOs in the HOF-2M mainly distribute on the HOF molecule and rarely on the methanol molecules. Similarly, the electron density of O1 atom decreases significantly, while the electron densities of O2 and O4 atoms increase slightly from HOMO to LUMO. The change of electron density of O atom implies the reduction in binding of O1 atom to H1 atom and the increase in the attraction of O2 and O4 atoms to H3 and H2 atoms respectively. In other words, the intensity of the HB1, HB2 and HB3 is enhanced in S1 state. Analysis of intermolecular charge transfer reversely demonstrated that O1-H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond is substituted in HOF-2M."
6,Absorption and emission spectra,"3.4 Absorption and emission spectra To avoid complex and cumbersome graphics, we plotted the absorption and emission spectra of HOF in three more characteristic solvents (Toluene, DMSO and methanol) in Fig. 4 . The corresponding data is gathered in Table 5 . The absorption peaks of HOF in the Toluene, DMSO and methanol solvents are 398 nm, 406 nm and 413 nm, respectively, which are consistent with the 388 nm, 393 nm and 395 nm measured in the experiment [42]. The polarity of the solvent influences the Stokes shifts of the absorption and emission spectra. HOF has two emission peaks, which correspond to the enol and keto forms in the aprotic solvents. However, only one emission peak corresponding to the enol form is displayed in protic solvents, such as methanol, which agrees with the experimental results. The complete quenching of K* (keto form in S1 state) emission indicates that the ESIPT reaction of HOF is blocked in methanol and ethanol solvents, which provides a suitable sensing mechanism for the monitoring of alcohols."
7,RDG analysis,"3.5 RDG analysis To visually observe the position and strength of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in HOF and HOF-2M, the scatter plots and gradient isosurfaces were processed using the Multiwfn program [44] relative to the reduced density gradient (RDG) versus sign (λ2) ρ are shown in Figs. 5–7 . The contour value is set as 0.5. The relevant formulas can be written as: (1) RDG r = 1 2 3 π 2 1 3 ∇ ρ r ρ r 4 3 (2) Ω r = Sign λ 2 r ρ r Here, ρ(r) and eigenvalue λ2 are used to reflect the strength and type of interaction, respectively. The negative the value of Ω(r) (the deeper the blue) indicates the strength of the hydrogen bond. As shown in Fig. 5, the spike peak of HOF-E is about −0.03, while the spike peak of HOF-E* is between −0.04 and −0.05, and the isosurface of HOF-E* is a deeper blue than that of HOF-E. Clearly, the O1-H1⋯O2 hydrogen bond is enhanced in S1 state. A similar analysis for Fig. 6 showed the spike peak of HOF-K between −0.04 and −0.05, while the spike peak of HOF-K* is between −0.03 and −0.04, and the isosurface of HOF-K is bluer than that of HOF-K*. As expected, the O1⋯H1-O2 hydrogen bond in S0 state is stronger than in S1 state. It further demonstrates that the reverse proton transfer of HOF takes place in S0 state rather than S1 state. In Fig. 7, the spike peak of both HOF-2M and HOF-2M* are between −0.04 and −0.05, but the spike peak of HOF-2M* is slightly negative to that of HOF-2M. This implies that three strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds form in HOF-2M system and their strength varies slightly from S0 to S1 state. We were pleased to find that the isosurface between O2 atom and H1 atom is green in HOF-2M. There should be a Van der Waals interaction between O2 atom and H1 atom rather than hydrogen bond interaction."
8,Topological analysis,"3.6 Topological analysis Topological analysis is a direct method to visualize the strength of hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the existence of bond paths and the identification of critical points (CPs) in equilibrium geometry are sufficient conditions for designating interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) between two main atoms can also be obtained [63]. The bond critical points (BCPs) and bond paths of the HOF and HOF-2M are shown in Fig. 8 , and parameters of BCP related to hydrogen bond are presented in Table 6 . As the topological analysis graphs of the HOF and HOF-2M system are similar in S0 and S1 states, and the difference is only in the BCP parameters. Thus, we selected the images in the S0 state as the representative images. BCP1, BCP2, BCP3, BCP4, BCP5 and BCP6 represent the bond critical points of HOF-E, HOF-E*, HOF-2M (HB1), HOF-2M (HB2), HOF-2M* (HB1) and HOF-2M* (HB2), respectively. As expected, bond paths and BCP exist between the H1 atom and O2 atom in HOF, but not in the HOF-2M system. This proves that only intermolecular hydrogen bonds exist in the HOF-2M system. A recent computational study classified the strength of hydrogen bonds into three categories according to the electron density (ρ(r)) at BCP, where ρ(r) ≥ 0.03 a.u. represents a strong hydrogen bond; ρ(r) ≤ 0.02 a.u. represents a weak hydrogen bond and 0.02 a.u. ≤ ρ(r) ≤ 0.03 a.u. represents a medium strength hydrogen bond. As can be seen in Table 6, ρ(r) of BCP1 and BCP2 are 0.0291 a.u. and 0.0412 a.u., respectively. This indicates a medium strength intramolecular hydrogen bond of HOF in S0 state, while an enhanced one in S1 state. The increase of hydrogen bonding energy (EHB) can also explain this. EHB is half of the potential energy density (V(r)), which can be expressed as: E HB = V r / 2 The ρ(r) values at BCP are all >0.03 a.u. in the HOF-2M system, indicating that the intermolecular hydrogen bond is strong. A closer look at Table 6 reveals that absolute values of ρ(r) and EHB have the same pattern of BCP5 > BCP3 and BCP6 > BCP4, as are the other BCP parameters. This shows a change in the strength of the intermolecular hydrogen bond from the S0 to the S1 states. In summary, the topological analysis further verifies that the O1-H1⋯O2 is broken by stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds in HOF-2M."
9,Potential energy curves,"3.7 Potential energy curves Proton transfer is a dynamic process in which intermediate products are produced at each step. The potential energy curves can reflect the energy of each structure that is constrained for optimization during proton transfer [64–66]. The PECs of HOF in DMSO obtained by gradually scanning the O1-H1 internuclear distances are presented in Fig. 9 . As the O1-H1 bond grows in distance from the initial stable point to the adjacent stable point, the energy increases gradually then decreases. The increased energy is the energy barrier that needs to be crossed for proton transfer. The barrier in S1 state (3.60 kcal/mol) is much smaller than that in S0 state (9.95 kcal/mol), which means proton transfer is more likely to occur in S1 state. While, the energy barrier required for the reverse proton transfer is 7.01 kcal/mol in S1 state, which is much larger than that in S0 state (1.36 kcal/mol). Hence, the reverse proton transfer will occur in S0 state instead of S1 state. The whole process of proton transfer can be summarized as follows: under the photo-excitation, the HOF-E form transitions from the S0 to S1 states (HOF-E*), and subsequently crosses a small barrier (3.60 kcal/mol) to the HOF-K* form. Since the reverse proton transfer in the S1 state needs to cross a large potential barrier (7.01 kcal/mol), the HOF-K* form will directly undergo a radiation transition back to the S0 state (HOF-K), and then returns to the original HOF-E form through the reverse proton transfer. We also simulated the reaction path of the H1 atom in the HOF-2M system. Interestingly, the H1 atom is transferred to the O3 atom instead of the O2 atom. We unsuccessfully attempted the optimization of the stable keto structure transferred from the H1 to O3 atom, which revealed that the O1-H1⋯O2 in the HOF-2M system is indeed broken by O1-H1⋯O3 and O4-H3⋯O2 preventing proton transfer. Since we only examined the reaction path of the H1 atom and there is no proton transfer in the HOF-2M system, the potential energy curves were not included."
10,Conclusions,"The DFT and TDDFT are used to characterize the hydrogen bonding interactions and ESIPT reaction of HOF in different solutions. The intra and intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions between HOF in DMSO and methanol solvents is separately analyzed. Three intermolecular hydrogen bonds at different sites are considered in the HOF-2M system, and the loss of O1-H1⋯O2 of HOF is seen. The cleavage of O1-H1⋯O2 leads to the inability of ESIPT to proceed, which reasonably explains the quenching of the fluorescent emission band in the experiment and provides sensing mechanism for the alcohols detecting. The obtained spectral data is consistent with the experimental data. The IR vibration spectra based on the optimized equilibrium geometries and the MOs indirectly reflect the properties of enhancing hydrogen bonds in S1 state. RDG analysis and topological analysis also produced visualized graphs of hydrogen bonds to provide clear evidence for our analysis results. Finally, the ESIPT process of HOF is discussed and analyzed in detail."
