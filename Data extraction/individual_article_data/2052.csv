0,Introduction,"Plastics are the most often chosen material for the packaging of cosmetics, food, or pharmaceutical goods related to economical and practical reasons, such as cost-effective, light-weight, and the ideal protection maintained to the packaged product (Reichert et al., 2020). The global plastic production was 322 million tons in 2015, and about 50 million tons of plastics were evaluated for packaging applications (Gan & Chow, 2018). However, the increase in plastic waste generation is leading to negative impact on the environment (Scudeler, Costa, Cortez-Vega, Prentice, & Fonseca, 2020). Sustainability and cleaner production goals can be achieved by minimizing the packaging wastes (Herbes, Beuthner, & Ramme, 2018). Hence, there is an intensified interest to develop bio-based packaging films as alternative eco-friendly materials to diminish the impact of synthetic or non-biodegradable plastics on the environment (Dominguez-Martinez et al., 2017; Haghighi et al., 2020; Narasagoudr, Hegde, Vanjeri, Chougale, & Masti, 2020; Varghese, Pulikkalparambil, Rangappa, Siengchin, & Parameswaranpillai, 2020). In the renewability and biodegradability context, the expected growth of packaging demand for bio-based materials will be around 9.45 million tons by 2023 (Bajpai, 2019). Proteins and polysaccharides are mainly utilized polymers to fabricate bio-based films and coatings. The widely used ones are derived from alginate, carrageenan, cellulose, chitosan, pectin, pullulan and starch. Among the polysaccharides, the excellent film-forming ability and bioactivity of chitosan make it a favorite candidate for food preservation applications (Lan et al., 2020). Moreover, chitosan has superior characteristics as being degradable and biocompatible with other ingredients (Mi, Tan, Liang, & Sung, 2002). Additionally, chitosan brings the advantage of environmentally safe biodegradability because the degradation products of chitosan are non-carcinogenic, non-immunogenic, and non-toxic (Mi et al., 2002; Preda & Enculescu, 2012). However, the drawbacks of this commercially available product are having low mechanical strength and thermal stability as well as being expensive (Haghighi et al., 2020). In this sense, the combination of chitosan with other polymers has been proven to be an efficient strategy to reduce costs. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been broadly evaluated thermoplastic for the development of blends and composites with several biopolymers (Bonilla, Fortunati, Atarés, Chiralt, & Kenny, 2014). PVA is a biodegradable and water-soluble polymer with good chemical resistance (Chen, Wang, Mao, Liao, & Hsieh, 2008). It demonstrates high flexibility, good barrier characteristics, non-toxicity and resistance to acid and alkali environment (Aloui et al., 2016; Liu, Wang, & Lan, 2018). This odorless polymer can be processed by using several techniques including casting, injection molding or blown ﬁlm extrusion to produce food packaging materials (Ge, Lansing, & Lewis, 2021). Chitosan/PVA blends are miscible due to interactions between hydroxyl groups of PVA and hydroxyl and amine groups of chitosan (Uslu, Çelikkan, Atakol, & Aksu, 2008). Chitosan/PVA films show improved mechanical properties, oxygen and water barrier properties compared to neat chitosan films (Liu et al., 2018; Luis, Alexander, Lilian, & Cristian, 2021). However, there is still a need to develop novel chitosan/PVA composite films with enhanced physical, thermal, mechanical properties and water resistance to fulfil the demand of practical applications (Huang, Wang, Xu, & Wang, 2012; Narasagoudr, Hegde, Chougale, Masti, & Dixit, 2020). In recent years, several research groups have reported the great potential of food processing and agricultural by-products (e.g. peel, pod, pomace, rind, kernel, seed, skin, and stem) addition into synthetic and bio‐based polymer matrices to improve functional properties (Fehlberg, Lee, Matuana, & Almenar, 2020; Lalnunthari, Devi, Amami, & Badwaik, 2019; Sogut & Cakmak, 2020). This is not only a solution to reduce waste formation and environmental pollution but also a solution for the preparation of green composites in view of the sustainable bio-economy (Mohanty, Misra, & Drzal, 2002). Orange peels are promising biofiller candidates for polymer composites production (Fehlberg et al., 2020; Mamman & Ramalan, 2020; Quiles-Carrillo, Montanes, Lagaron, Balart, & Torres-Giner, 2018; Rathinavel & Saravanakumar, 2020; Tasdemir, Sahin, Karabulut, & Guru, 2019), owing to wide availability, low cost, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, which can propose great opportunities to improve value-added and environmentally friendly structural composites from waste. Orange is the main citrus fruit that has grown around the world with an estimated 49.6 million tons production in 2016/17 (Maharjan et al., 2017). In general, about 70 % of orange is used in juice or jam production (Siles, Vargas, Gutierrez, Chica, & Martin, 2016) and approximately 50 % of orange peel is produced during juice extraction (Verma et al., 2020), which is regarded as a by-product with low economic value. A little amount of the orange peel is evaluated in the food formulations like biscuits, cookies, drinks and sauces. Whereas, the rest of the peels with high moisture and complex organic content create a major disposal and soil pollution problem in countries with large orange production (Maharjan et al., 2017; Verma et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2018). However, this widely available and cheap material is composed of insoluble fibers, such as; cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and soluble ones such as pectin (Pandiarajan, Kamaraj, Vasudevan, & Vasudevan, 2018). Studies have also reported that orange peel contains natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds, in particular essential oils and polyphenols including limonene, myrcene, α-farnesene, γ-terpinene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinolene (Bechlin, Granella, Christ, Coelho, & Paz, 2020; Kevij, Salami, Mohammadian, Khodadadi, & Emam-Djomeh, 2020; McKay, Sawant, Fehlberg, & Almenar, 2021). Since orange peel contains valuable fibers and compounds, this by-product presents promising components that could also be evaluated in the development of polymer matrices as active and cost-effective natural additive. Studies have evaluated orange peels on the preparation of different polymer films (Kevij et al., 2020; Rathinavel & Saravanakumar, 2020; Sucheta, Rai, Chaturvedi, & Yadav, 2019), but the study of chitosan/PVA/orange peel ternary blends as an antioxidant active packaging film is still rare. Therefore, the present study focuses on preparation of orange peel powder incorporated chitosan/PVA composite films. The effect of orange peel contents on the barrier, color, mechanical, morphological, optical, structural, thermal, wettability as well as antioxidant activity properties of biocomposite films were evaluated. This work may provide a new insight for fruit peel incorporated chitosan and PVA based composite films not only in food preservation but also in biomedical applications (e.g. wound healing) that need innovative antioxidant strategies."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (≥ 75 % deacetylated) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dermstadt, GERMANY). PVA (average molecular weight; 44.05 g/mole, 95.4 % purity, 87.16 % hydrolysis degree, 24.9 mPa.S viscosity) was purchased from Zag Kimya (İstanbul, TURKEY). Orange peel (12 % w/w pectin) was purchased from Naturelka (Aydın, TURKEY). The orange peel was sieved using a steel mesh sieve (<100 μm). Glycerol was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, GERMANY). Acetic acid (Glacial, 100 % Anhydrous) was supplied from ISOLAB Chemicals (GERMANY). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), α‐tocopherol, β‐carotene, 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picryl‐hydrazyl (DPPH), linoleic acid and 2,2′‐azino‐bis (3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Sigma‐Aldrich GmbH, Steinheim, GERMANY)."
3,Preparation of chitosan/PVA/orange peel films,"2.2 Preparation of chitosan/PVA/orange peel films Five different biocomposite films were developed by the casting method (see details in Table S1 from the Supplementary File). Chitosan was dissolved in aqueous acetic acid solution (1 % v/v) at 50 °C with continuous stirring (250 rpm) for 2 h to obtain chitosan solution (1 % w/v). The PVA solution (5 % w/v) was prepared in distilled water at 75 °C for 12 h with stirring (250 rpm). The solutions of PVA and chitosan were mixed at 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1 v/v ratio by mechanical stirrer (600 rpm) to obtain a homogeneous solution. Based on the higher mechanical property, the PVA/chitosan ratio was chosen at 2:1 to prepare orange peel incorporated films (see details in Table S2 from the Supplementary File). Further, a specific amount of the orange peel (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 or 1.25 wt % in respect to the total mass of the polymers) was added to the solution and stirred at 50 °C for 1.5 h (250 rpm). As plasticizer glycerol was added to the mixed solution and the resulting mixture was stirred for half an hour at room temperature. This mixture (40 mL) was then cast onto round glass petri dishes (11.5 × 11.5 cm) and dried in an oven at 50 °C for 18 h (Fig.1 ). The prepared films were labeled as CH/PVA/OP0, CH/PVA/OP1, CH/PVA/OP2, CH/PVA/OP3, and CH/PVA/OP4, respectively."
4,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The cross-section and surface morphologies of the films were examined using SEM (Carl Zeiss/Gemini 300, Germany) at 5 kV acceleration voltage after the samples were coated with gold thin layers (15 nm) to diminish the charging effect."
5,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),"2.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The chemical structures and interactions of composite films were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet iS50 FT-IR, USA). The spectral information of films was recorded between wavenumbers of 500−4000 cm−1 at 4 cm-1 resolutions by transmission mode (Terzioğlu, Altin, Kalemtas, & Celik-Bedeloglu, 2020)."
6,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"2.5 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermal degradation of the films was monitored by using a TA/SDT650 (TA Instruments, Inc., New Castle, USA) thermogravimetric analyzer. The films were heated from 25 °C to 600 °C and 600 °C–900 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and an oxygen atmosphere, respectively (Terzioğlu et al., 2020). The heating rate was 20 °C/min."
7,Film thickness,"2.6 Film thickness The film thickness was measured using a digital caliper (ABS ASİMETO, Turkey) at five random positions for each sample. The measurement value was given as the arithmetic mean value."
8,Mechanical properties,"2.7 Mechanical properties The tensile strength, elongation at break and Young’s modulus of the composite films were studied using a universal testing machine (AGS-X Series, Shimadzu, Japan) with a crosshead speed of 15 mm/min under 1 kN load cell according to the protocol outlined in ASTM D882. The mechanical properties were examined from five separate measurements of each sample and the average data with standard deviations were presented."
9,Water solubility,"2.8 Water solubility The water solubility of the film samples was determined according to the method of Narasagoudr, Hegde, Chougale et al. (2020) and Amalraj, Haponiuk, Thomas, and Gopi (2020) with slight modifications. Film samples (2 × 2 cm) were dried at 60 °C for 24 h in an oven. Each film pieces were weighed (W1) and then immersed in 50 mL distilled water at 25 °C. After 24 h, films were dried at 60 °C for 24 h and reweighed (W2). The water solubility of film was calculated by: (1) S o l u b i l i t y % = W 1 - W 2 W 1 x 100"
10,Barrier properties,"2.9 Barrier properties Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the films were determined gravimetrically according to the method of the ASTM Standard Test Method (ASTM (American Society for Testing & Materials), 2003) with slight modifications. Briefly, the film sample was cut into a square (4 × 4 cm) and sealed over a centrifuge tube containing dried silica gel 0 % RH. The tube was stored in a desiccator at room temperature and 100 % RH. Changes in the weight of the cup were recorded at intervals of 1 h for 8 h. The WVP of the film was calculated by (Sarıcaoglu & Turhan, 2020): (2) W V P = w t x L Δ P x A where w/t is calculated by linear regression (R2>0.99) from the water absorbed by the system at the steady-state. A is the area of the circular mouth of the tube, L is the average film thickness, and ΔP (kPa) is the water vapor pressure difference through the film at 25 °C. Oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of the films were determined according to the ASTM D3985 procedure using an oxygen permeation analyzer (Systech Illinois Instruments Co., Model 8001, Johnsburg, USA). The films were evaluated at 23 °C and 0 % relative humidity according to the ASTM D 3985 method (ASTM (American Society for Testing & Materials), 2010)."
11,Contact angle measurements,"2.10 Contact angle measurements Contact angles were measured with an automatic dispenser system Attension Theta Lite model optical tensiometer (Biolin Scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden) via dropping distilled water (5 μL) to 2 × 2 cm film samples (Remedio, dos Santos, Maciel, Yoshida, & de Carvalho, 2019). The results were given as the average of three determinations."
12,Color measurements,"2.11 Color measurements The color and transmission measurements of films were performed with a color spectrophotometer (X-Rite Ci7800, Michigan, USA) with a standard illuminant D65 (daylight, without spectral highlights) and a 10 mm diameter area of illumination. The instrument was calibrated using the white standard and black trap included in the cap of the instrument and set to measure in the CIE L*a*b* format whereby values of spectro-photometric and photographic analysis are ‘L’ (brightness), ‘a’ (red-green axis), and ‘b’ (yellow-blue axis), respectively. Yellowness index and whiteness index were calculated according to the following equations as described by Koosh and Hamedi (2019). All measurements of the samples were measured five times at different locations. The results were reported as the means of measurements. (3) Y e l l o w n e s s i n d e x = 142.86 b * L * (4) W h i t e n e s s i n d e x = 100 – ( 100 - L * ) 2 + a * 2 + b * 2"
13,Film opacity and transparency,"2.12 Film opacity and transparency Film opacity and transparency were examined using the method as described by Cazón, Vázquez, and Velázquez (2020). The absorbance and transmittance spectrum of 200−800 nm was recorded for each sample using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The transparency and opacity of the films calculated using equation 5 and 6, respectively. (5) T r a n s p a r e n c y = log ( % T 600 ) x (6) O p a c i t y = A b s 500 x where %T600 = the percent transmittance, Abs500 = the absorbance at 500 nm and x = film thickness (mm)."
14,Antioxidant activity,"2.13 Antioxidant activity The antioxidant activities of films were determined using three different methods as DPPH free radical scavenging activity (Ferreira, Nunes, Castro, Ferreira, & Coimbra, 2014; Öztürk, Tel, Öztürk, & Duru, 2014), ABTS cation radical scavenging activity (Ferreira et al., 2014; Öztürk et al., 2014) and cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assays (Apak, Güçlü, Özyürek, & Karademir, 2004). Films were cut into small pieces and immersed in the solutions. All biological activity tests were carried out at four concentrations of the film solutions as 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 μg/mL. The antioxidant activity results of DPPH radical scavenging and ABTS cation radical scavenging activity assays are presented as 50 % inhibition concentration (IC50), while CUPRAC capacity activity assay results were given as absorbance (A0.50). The results were compared with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and α-tocopherol (TOC) used as antioxidant standards. The antioxidant activity assays were carried out with a 96‐well microplate reader, SpectraMax 340PC384, Molecular Devices (USA)."
15,Results and discussion,
16,SEM of orange peel and biocomposite films,"3.1 SEM of orange peel and biocomposite films The morphology of orange peel powder is presented in Fig. 2 . The peel particles have a heterogeneous size. The surface of the orange peel was rough with small pores. A similar observation was reported in the literature (Mafra, Igarashi-Mafra, Zuim, Vasques, & Ferreira, 2013). The final microstructure of the composite films mainly related to the interactions between the fillers and polymers in the blend (Bonilla et al., 2014). SEM was used to determine the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the biocomposite films, as shown in Fig.3 . The surface of the control film was uniform and smooth. The orange peel powder was unable to fully solubilize in the polymer solution. Therefore, a few agglomerates due to the insoluble particles were present in the surface of films. Since the chitosan and PVA have high compatibility, there was not any evidence of micro-phase separation in the cross-sections of films (Fig.3B). Also, no air bubbles, cracks and pores were observed from the SEM micrographs. The cross-sectional images of all films showed continuous and compact morphologies. It can be said that orange peels were dispersed within the polymer blend by the stronger adhesion on the interfaces of orange peel and macromolecular chains of the two polymers due to no obvious aggregations of orange peel in the cross-sections (El Miri et al., 2015)."
17,FT-IR analysis of orange peel and biocomposite films,"3.2 FT-IR analysis of orange peel and biocomposite films The FTIR spectrum of orange peel is presented in Fig. S1 (see details from the Supplementary File). Assignment of spectra is listed in Table 1 . The FTIR spectrum of orange peel exhibited the characteristic IR peaks. The FTIR analysis was performed to determine the structure of the biocomposite films. The assignments for absorption peaks are presented in Table 2 . The FT-IR spectra was given as Fig.S2 (see details from the Supplementary File). Several characteristic peaks of stretching and bending vibrations related to chitosan and PVA are exhibited in the spectra of the films. Compared to spectra of neat film, there are shifts in peaks at 1715, 1420, 1085 and 1025 cm−1 and a small intensity change of band centered at 1085 cm−1. The peak at 1715 cm−1 shifted to lower wavenumber indicated the increase in CO functional groups in the films. This should be explained by the intermolecular interactions between the orange peel and chitosan/PVA matrix (Lan et al., 2020). Besides, the shift of peak at 1420 and 1085 cm−1 to the lower wavenumber showed the participation of aliphatic and CO groups of orange peel in blending with polymers, respectively. Finally, the identification of the contribution of part of orange peel components as COC stretching of the polysaccharides was observed with the shift and intensity change at 1025 cm−1 (Campagnolo et al., 2019). The mentioned functional groups are responsible for the interactions. These results were evidence of good miscibility between chitosan, PVA and orange peel."
18,Thickness and mechanical properties of biocomposite films,"3.3 Thickness and mechanical properties of biocomposite films Film thickness is a significant parameter in determining physical characteristics of film (Kanatt, Rao, Chawla, & Sharma, 2012). The thicknesses of the chitosan/PVA films containing orange peel powder are given in Table 3 . As expected, the neat chitosan/PVA films were the thinnest (115 μm in average). The addition of orange peel to the polymer solution changed the average thickness of the films. The results showed that the thickness of the film increased when the orange peel powder content was increased from 0 % to 0.25 %, and the thicknesses were 115 and 120 μm, respectively. Increasing the orange peel powder from 1.00 %–1.25 % also led to an increase in the film thickness from 132 to 138 μm. This is due to the structure of incorporated orange peel powder, which is composed of both soluble and insoluble fibers (Hanani, Yee, & Nor-Khaizura, 2019). Furthermore, the increase in thickness with the orange peel loading could be related to the increase of solid content in films (Gaikwad, Lee, & Lee, 2016). Hanani et al. (2019) also reported that increase in the thickness of the fish gelatin films with the addition of pomegranate peel powder to the film-forming solution. Mechanical properties are very critical parameters in exploiting different biocomposite films for packaging purposes (Vahedikia et al., 2019). Generally, good tensile strength, sufficient elongation, flexibility and resistance to drilling is expected requirements (Martins, Romani, Martins, & Filipini, 2019). Packaging film must be capable of protecting against biological, chemical and physical damages with the changing environmental conditions, during handling, storage and shipping (Chavoshizadeh, Pirsa, & Mohtarami, 2020; Yang et al., 2016). Therefore, tensile analyses were examined to determine the effects of orange peel powder content and its combination with chitosan and PVA on the elastic-plastic behavior of the final bicomposites. Effect of orange peel powder content on elongation at break (EAB%), tensile strength (TS) and Young’s modulus (YM) of the chitosan/PVA films are presented in Table 3. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus of neat chitosan/PVA film were found to be 23.09 MPa and 18.64 MPa, respectively. The obtained TS value was similar to the value (24.9 MPa) reported for chitosan/PVA film (El Bourakadi et al., 2019). According to Table 4 , the addition of orange peel to chitosan/PVA film slightly decreased the TS from 23.09 MPa (control sample) to 17.77–21.43 MPa. The reason may be due to the reduction of inter-chain force of attraction within the polymer matrix (Mittal et al., 2016). This is in agreement with the study of Gaikwad et al. (2016), in which the neat PVA film exhibited lower tensile strength (11.24 MPa) than 1 % apple pomace incorporated film (10.85 MPa). For Young’s modulus, there was almost no difference between the results of neat chitosan/PVA and biocomposites films. It was observed that orange peel powder gave a significant contribution to elongation at break performance of the biocomposites. The EAB of the neat film increased from 220.84 %–257.52 % with the addition of 1 % orange peel powder. The further increase of peel powder content slightly decreased the EAB to 234.67 %. The reduced TS and enhanced EAB should be due to the plasticizer function of orange peel powder containing polysaccharides. The polysaccharides decrease the intermolecular forces and subsequently increase the polymer chains mobility (Ma, Liang, Cao, & Wang, 2018). It can be said that the obtained biocomposite films were mechanically flexible materials due to the observed elongation at break values."
19,Thermal properties of biocomposite films,"3.4 Thermal properties of biocomposite films Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is considered one of the most important techniques for studying the thermal stability of polymers and polymer composites for packaging materials. TGA analysis results of the chitosan/PVA films with or without orange peel powder are tabulated in Table 4. All biocomposite films presented four decomposition steps (see details in Fig.S3 from the Supplementary File). The first (35−140 °C) and second (170−240 °C) stage was associated with the evaporation of physically and chemically absorbed water and residual acetic acid, and thermal degradation of the polymer chains, respectively. The whole decomposition of blend components occurred in the third stage (250−420 °C). The weight loss observed in the last stage was related to the gradual oxidative degradation of carbonaceous residue formed in the third stage (Kasai et al., 2019). The decomposed residual weight of biocomposite films was increased after the incorporation of orange peel powder. As presented in Fig.S3, the addition of orange peel nano-filler increased the thermal resistance of biocomposite. The TGA thermogram of the samples exhibited a similar pattern which was the evidence of compatibility between the polymers and orange peel. It was observed that CH/PVA/OP4 biocomposite film exhibited the best thermal stability among other films. Besides, the temperatures of 10 % and 50 % residual weight were increased to higher values for orange peel loaded films compared to the neat film (Table 4). This result may be due to the hydroxyl groups of orange peel which led to the formation of strong hydrogen bonding interactions with polymer chains impeding the evaporation of water molecules and subsequently degradation of the chains."
20,Solubility and water vapor permeability (WVP) of biocomposite films,"3.5 Solubility and water vapor permeability (WVP) of biocomposite films The water solubility of the film is one of the key factor for packaging applications (Amalraj et al., 2020; Sarıcaoglu & Turhan, 2020). The component type and concentration as well as the wettability and surface behavior of the film are the effective parameters on the solubility of the films. The solubility of neat chitosan/PVA film showed the lowest water solubility value (78.2 ± 0.4 %). The result was comparable to those of Razmjoo et al. (2021) who reported 76 % solubility for pure PVA film. The addition of hydrophilic components caused an increase in the solubility value (Amalraj et al., 2020). Hence, the addition of orange peel slightly increased the solubility of films. The water solubilities of CH/PVA/OP1−CH/PVA/OP4 films were found to be 81.4 ± 0.3, 82.3 ± 0.4, 82.1 ± 0.6 and 83.1 ± 0.5 %, respectively. In general, high solubility would demonstrate lower water resistance; but high solubility is an indicator of biodegradability which could be an advantage in some applications including packaging wraps (Tajik et al., 2013). The water vapor permeability (WVP) of the films were ranged between 0.249−0.478 g mm kPa−1 h−1 m-2. The WVP of neat chitosan/PVA film was found to be the lowest. The presence of orange peel caused slight increases in the WVP values. The WVP values of CH/PVA/OP1−CH/PVA/OP4 films were found to be 0.293, 0.337, 0.433 and 0.478 g mm kPa−1 h−1 m-2, respectively. This could be explained by the more heterogeneous microstructure of orange peel incorporated films than neat chitosan/PVA film due to agglomerated particles on the surface of films as evaluated by SEM as well as the hydrophilic nature of orange peel (Moghadam, Salami, Mohammadian, Khodadadi, & Emam-Djomeh, 2020). A similar trend has also been reported by Hanani et al. (2019) for pomegranate peel powder incorporated fish gelatin films."
21,Oxygen transmission rate of biocomposite films,"3.6 Oxygen transmission rate of biocomposite films It is important to obtain packaging films having proper oxygen permeability especially for extending the shelf life of oxidation sensitive foods. The neat chitosan/PVA film was found to show a higher oxygen transmission rate (28.4 cc/(m2 day atm)) compared to all the orange peel loaded films. The OP of the films showed a slightly decreasing trend when the orange peel concentration increased. The OP values of CH/PVA/OP1−CH/PVA/OP4 films found to be 27.0, 24.3, 23.5 and 21.9 cc/(m2 day atm), respectively."
22,Physical appearance and optical properties of biocomposite films,"3.7 Physical appearance and optical properties of biocomposite films The optical properties such as color, transparency and opacity are significant characteristics of the film's appearance. It can be seen that the dried orange peel powder has a yellowish color and fibrous structure. Visually, the chitosan/PVA films containing orange peel powder had a very slight yellow color while neat ones were transparent and colorless. Similar phenomena of chitosan/PVA films were reported in previous researches (Yao, Hu, Qin, & Liu, 2020; Yu, Song, Shi, Xu, & Bin, 2011). The color of chitosan/PVA films changed and deepened with the increase of orange peel content (Fig. 4 ). Color parameters of the biocomposite films were summarized in Table 5 . Orange peel added chitosan/PVA films had lower L*, a* and whiteness index values than neat chitosan/PVA film. The b* value showed an increase in the yellow color intensity of orange peel loaded films compared to neat film (CH/PVA/OP0). The yellowness index values indicated that there was an increase in yellowness of the films with increasing orange peel content. These results were in accordance with the previous studies which reported that gelatin and pectin films including orange peel powder showed yellowish color because of the presence of pigments (e.g. carotenoid) in the orange peel (Kevij et al., 2020; Sucheta et al., 2019). The color and UV–vis light barrier, are important features to demonstrate the effectiveness of packaging for food and beverage applications as a protective agent lessening the effects of light on food deterioration (Hamdi, Nasri, Li, & Nasri, 2019; Kwon et al., 2018). UV–vis barrier properties of films were evaluated by the light transmittance of the samples (Fig.5 ). The neat chitosan/PVA film showed the highest transparency, while the incorporation of orange peel resulted in the decrease of the transparency values as a function of filler concentration, in agreement with color changes. This decrease might be because of the light scattering due to the presence of filler in the polymer matrix. The result is comparable to the study of Sogut and Cakmak (2020), who conducted the study on the evaluation of carrot fiber for chitosan films. The transparencies of films were also similar to the value of synthetic film (Lee, Son, & Hong, 2008). Also, the opacity values of the orange peel loaded films were higher when compared to the neat film (0.38 ± 0.04). The opacity of films increased consistently with increasing orange peel content from 0.46 ± 0.06 to 0.71 ± 0.09 (see details in Table S3 from the Supplementary File). It is evident that, as compared with neat film, orange peel containing films could be more efficient alternatives to protect the packed products from UV–vis light radiation that causes lipid oxidation, flavor and nutrient loss (Kevij et al., 2020). The CH/PVA/OP4 film with the highest peel concentration could have better barrier to ultraviolet light."
23,Surface wettability,"3.8 Surface wettability The surface wettability of biocomposite films is shown in Fig.6 . It is important to note that all prepared films exhibited hydrophobic surfaces with contact angles θ > 90 °, except CH/PVA/OP4 (Hambleton, Fabra, Debeaufort, Dury-Brun, & Voilley, 2009). The water contact angle value of the neat chitosan/PVA film was 120.0 °, higher than the value reported by Ghaderi, Hosseini, Keyvani, and Gómez-Guillén (2019) for chitosan/PVA blend film (74.9 °). Compared with neat chitosan/PVA film, the contact angle values progressively decreased in films with the increasing content of orange peel powder addition."
24,Antioxidant activity,"3.9 Antioxidant activity Antioxidant packaging is a significant category of active packaging which is a very promising technique to extend the shelf life of food products or to maintain or enhance the condition of the packaged food (Gómez-Estaca, López-de-Dicastillo, Hernández-Muñoz, Catalá, & Gavara, 2014; Hajji et al., 2016). Orange peel is bioactive compounds-rich by-product that was reported to be a renewable and valuable source of natural antioxidants (Bechlin et al., 2020). It can be supposed that the bioactivity of chitosan/PVA films will be enhanced by orange peel addition. Therefore, the bioactivity evaluations of films were determined using three different antioxidant activity assays (Table 6 ). The results indicated that radical scavenging activity could be observed in all films. The neat chitosan/PVA films also showed antioxidant activity that may be associated with the chitosan itself due to the availability of hydroxyl and free amino groups in the chitosan as well the strong hydrogen-donating ability of them (Demetgül & Beyazit, 2018; Xie, Xu, & Liu, 2001). As shown in Table 6, orange peel incorporated films exhibited higher antioxidant activity than neat chitosan/PVA film in a dose-dependent manner. The antioxidant activity of CH/PVA/OP4 film was the highest among all the films. The incorporation of 1.25 % orange peel powders resulted in a higher DPPH value, with up to a 25 % increase compared to neat films. The activities of films surpassed the antioxidant capacity of BHT and α-TOC in DPPH radical scavenging and CUPRAC assays, respectively. Previous literature has also reported an increase of film antioxidant activity with the addition of different fruit peel powders (Hanani, Husna, Syahida, Nor-Khaizura, & Jamilah, 2018, 2019; Moghadam et al., 2020). Additionally, the comparison between the antioxidant capacities of the orange peel and composite films demonstrated that the bioactivities of the films were higher than the peel. This could be explained by the additional antioxidant activity related to chitosan. Above results showed that orange peel incorporated films could be used in the food industry for antioxidant packaging applications."
25,Conclusion,"The biocomposite films were successively prepared by incorporation of orange peel to chitosan/PVA networks. The morphology, mechanical, optical, thermal and wettability properties of the films were affected by the orange peel content. The elongation at break values of films increased with the addition of orange peel powder and it had a negative correlation with the tensile strength results. The visible color alteration was observed after orange peel incorporation to the neat film. Orange peel addition led to a reduction in transparency by possessing a possible light-hindering characteristic. This effect was more noticeable at high orange peel contents. The water contact angle values indicated that the surface hydrophobicity of chitosan/PVA film decreased with the addition of orange peel powder. The thickness, flexibility, thermal stability and water vapor permeability of the chitosan/PVA films were increased, with the incorporation of orange peel. Moreover, orange peel in chitosan/PVA films tended to decrease the oxygen permeability. The antioxidant activity of films enhanced with peel addition showing the potential of films to preserve foods that have high sensitivity to oxidation. The orange peel powder can be evaluated as a low-cost filler to enhance the properties of biopolymer-based packaging films. Further efforts should be realized on the antimicrobial properties and biodegradation behavior of these films. Considering the evaluated properties, the biowaste incorporated composite films can find potential applications in the active packaging industry as a partial alternative to synthetic counterparts."
