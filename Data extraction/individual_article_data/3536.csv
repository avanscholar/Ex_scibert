0,Introduction,"The demand for hydrogen is increasing in recent times because of its wide applications in areas such as the production of chemicals, aerospace propulsion, metallurgy, crude oil refining, heavy oil and oil sands upgrading, and as fuel for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. Efforts to use hydrogen obtained from renewable source as fuel in fuel cells have also been intensified for the purposes of enabling alternative energy supply, environmental protection and regional development. Even though hydrogen possesses the highest energy content per unit weight (i.e., 120.7kJ/g) compared to any of the known fuels and burns cleanly (Krumpelt et al., 2003), it does not exist in the free form. An economically viable way of obtaining hydrogen can thus provide an alternative to the present world-wide reliance on fossil fuels with their attendant high pollution and release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Traditionally, hydrogen is produced commercially by the steam reforming of natural gas or naphtha (Sun et al., 2004). However, if a global cycle of clean and sustainable production of energy is envisaged, a new eco-friendly reservoir of hydrogen is needed. In this context, ethanol (a form of biomass) satisfies most of these requirements since it is easy to produce, and is also safe to handle, store and transport. Also, it is biodegradable, free of sulfur, low in toxicity and could be easily steam reformed to generate a hydrogen-rich mixture. In addition, it has high hydrogen content per kg of material compared to methane, ethylene glycol, glycerol, glucose, and sorbitol. In the literature, the thermodynamic feasibility of the catalytic steam reforming of ethanol (CSRE) to produce H 2 has been fully investigated (Fishtik et al., 2000; Freni et al., 1996; Vasudeva et al., 1996). The reaction of ethanol with steam is strongly endothermic and the desirable reaction produces only H 2 and CO 2 as shown in the reaction scheme 1: (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 ( Δ H 298 K =+ 174 kJ mol - 1 ) . However, in practice, other undesirable products such as CO and CH 4 and coke formation could also be obtained. Understanding the reaction pathways in any process is important in order to give an insight to why certain products are obtained at different reaction conditions and provide the ability to select the reaction conditions such as to favor the selective production of the desired products. Attempts have been made by Aupretre et al. (2005), Cavallaro et al. (2003), Comas et al. (2004), Frusteri et al. (2004a), and Haryanto et al. (2005) to elucidate the reaction pathways during the steam reforming of ethanol. The first and the third two groups of workers independently observed that ethylene and acetaldehyde were the two intermediates formed via dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. These intermediates are stable at temperatures below 473K but are completely reformed by steam (Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively) at temperatures above 673K (Fajardo and Probst, 2006). They concluded that the formation of these intermediates is as a result of ethanol decomposition or cracking and not from the reaction with steam: (2) C 2 H 4 + 2 H 2 O = CH 4 + CO 2 + 2 H 2 , (3) CH 3 CHO + H 2 O = CH 4 + CO 2 + H 2 . Comas et al. (2004) specifically noted that as the temperature increases from 673 to 773K, methane selectivity decreases while CO selectivity increases. They attributed the formation of CO to the initiation of steam reforming of methane at this temperature range and pointed out that the steam reforming of methane is the controlling reaction at this temperature range. Although, no evidence of water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) has been reported with Ni-based catalyst (Comas et al., 2004), evidence of WGSR have been reported over noble metals at high temperatures during steam reforming. Frusteri et al. (2004b), working on the reforming of ethanol over Rh/MgO at 923K, reported that the product distribution at this temperature range is largely governed by steam reforming of methane (SRM) and WGSR. The main problem encountered in CSRE is the formation of coke on the active sites of the metal which reduces the activity of the metal. The formation of coke has been reported to occur either from Boudard reaction or ethylene polymerization (Fatsikostas et al., 2002; Vaidya and Rodrigues, 2006a,b). The level of coking is greatly influenced by the reaction conditions and the properties of the catalyst. It has been reported that high water to ethanol ratio highly suppresses coking and certain metals such as copper have been reported to be very good candidate for the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde without any trace of ethylene being formed at low temperatures (Franckaerts and Froment, 1964; Raich and Foley, 1998; Tu and Chen, 1998). Consequently, Vaidya and Rodrigues (2006a) suggested that a two-layer bed of catalyst arrangement comprising a copper-based catalyst in the first layer and a second layer comprising Ni-based catalyst be used in CSRE in order to suppress the formation of coke via ethylene polymerization. The acetaldehyde formed at the first layer which is favored by Cu catalyst can then be completely reformed at high temperatures in the second layer made of Ni to obtain a hydrogen rich mixture. The possibility of obtaining a very high ethanol conversion in CSRE has been confirmed by Aupretre et al. (2002), Fatsikostas et al. (2002), and Freni et al. (2003). These workers also observed catalyst stability for their respective catalysts. On the issue of the feed material, it has been found that the non-distilled product of fermentation to produce ethanol (fermentation broth or crude ethanol) is a good source of ethanol for reforming, which has been shown (Akande, 2005; Akande et al., 2005, 2006) to be a potential feed for the production of hydrogen since the cost of the energy intensive distillation and purification of fermentation broth to obtain pure ethanol is circumvented. Also, crude ethanol contains other additional oxygenated hydrocarbons that can easily be reformed to produce hydrogen. Recently, we reported a 79% conversion of fermentation broth containing 12% ethanol over 15% Ni / Al 2 O 3 catalyst in a packed bed reactor (Akande, 2005; Akande et al., 2005). However, the 12% v / v ethanol content in the broth is adjudged to be dilute, and thus, substantial energy is used for simply vaporizing the excess water. In order to improve the economic viability of the process, the energetic advantages of the alcohol solution have to be improved (Haga et al., 1998). In this study, we have used concentrated crude ethanol (37% v / v ethanol) obtained from the reflux arm of the distillation column in order to improve the energetic advantages. The purpose of the present study is to perform a kinetic and reactor modeling for simulation of the production of hydrogen by the reforming of concentrated crude ethanol in a fixed bed tubular reactor."
1,Theory,
2,Kinetic modeling,"2.1 Kinetic modeling The development of kinetic model requires a good formulation of the elementary steps that lead from the feed materials to products. Few reports are available in the literature on the mechanism of this process (Akande, 2005; Akande et al., 2006; Diagne et al., 2002; Kugai et al., 2005; Mavrikakis and Barteau, 1998; Marino et al., 2004; Sheng et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2005; Fatsikostas and Verykios, 2004; Therdthianwong et al., 2001; Vaidya and Rodrigues, 2006b). The first two cited works investigated the mechanism of crude ethanol reforming over 15% Ni / Al 2 O 3 using dilute crude ethanol (15% v / v ). They formulated their elementary steps using Eley–Rideal (ER) mechanism and reported that the rate limiting step is the dissociation of adsorbed ethanol. Equally, Diagne et al. (2002) reported the following elementary steps which incorporated all the reactions that give rise to all the products obtained during the steam reforming of ethanol over Rh based catalyst as the possible mechanism ( ( a ) : adsorbed): (4) CH 3 CH 2 OH → CH 3 CH 2 O ( a ) + H ( a ) , (5) CH 3 CH 2 O ( a ) → ( a ) CH 2 – CH 2 O ( a ) + H ( a ) , (6) ( a ) CH 2 – CH 2 O ( a ) → CH 4 ( g ) + CO ( g ) , (7) CH 4 + H 2 O ( a ) → 3 H 2 ( g ) + CO ( g ) , (8) 2 CO + 2 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 , (9) 2 H ( a ) → H 2 ( g ) . These authors (Diagne et al., 2002) suggested that the rate limiting step for the production of hydrogen from ethanol is the formation of CH 4 via the surface reaction of adsorbed oxametallacycle intermediate. All the referred works except the first two agreed that acetaldehyde is the most likely intermediate formed during ethanol decomposition. Thus, although a lot of studies have been done on the reaction mechanism of steam reforming of ethanol as cited above, limited attempts have been made to formulate a mechanistic rate expression for the reaction. Also, only limited attempts (Sun et al., 2005; Vaidya and Rodrigues, 2006b) have been made in testing the validity of their rate expressions against experimentally obtained results. These authors independently showed that the steam reforming of ethanol is first order with respect to ethanol. Akande et al. (2005) had earlier formulated an ER based kinetic model for reforming of crude ethanol by assuming the dissociation of adsorbed ethanol as the rate determining step. However, this model did not adequately predict the present experimental results probably because different catalysts were used for the two studies. Thus, there is the need to develop a new kinetic model based on the elementary steps formulated for the new catalyst. The overall reaction used for the development of the kinetic models for the crude ethanol steam reforming is given in (10) C 2 H 6 O + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 , Δ H 298 K =+ 1.73 × 10 5 J / mol . Ethanol was used as the representative material for crude ethanol for simplicity and because of its much higher concentration compared to other components that are present in the crude ethanol mixture. Empirical and mechanistic rate models were developed to fit the experimental data as follows. Firstly, an empirical, irreversible fixed feed molar ratio power law rate model was developed as shown in (11) r A = k 0 e ( - E / RT ) N A n . Secondly, different mechanistic models were developed based on Langmuir–Helshinwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) and ER mechanisms. Basically, LHHW differs from the ER mechanism in that the former requires the adsorption of the two reactant species on the catalyst active site for any transformation to take place whereas the latter requires only one of the two reactants species to adsorb. We developed each of the kinetic models by considering each of the elementary reactions steps given below as the rate determining step. The elementary reactions assumed to have taken place in the process based on LHHW mechanism are given below: (a) Adsorption of ethanol on the catalyst active site: (12) C 2 H 6 O + ( a ) ↔ C 2 H 6 O * ( a ) . (b) Interaction of the adsorbed crude ethanol with an adjacent vacant site: (13) C 2 H 6 O * ( a ) + ( a ) ↔ CH 3 O * ( a ) + CH 3 * ( a ) . (c) Adsorption of water on the catalyst active site: (14) 3 H 2 O + 3 ( a ) ↔ 3 H 2 O * ( a ) . (d) Surface reaction (1) of water to produce surface oxygen and molecular hydrogen vapor: (15) 3 H 2 O * ( a ) ↔ 3 O * ( a ) + 3 H 2 . (e) Surface reaction (2) between adsorbed species: (16) CH 3 O * ( a ) + O * ( a ) + 2 ( a ) ↔ CO 2 * ( a ) + 3 H * ( a ) . (f) Surface reaction (3) between adsorbed species: (17) CH 3 * ( a ) + 2 O * ( a ) + ( a ) ↔ CO 2 * ( a ) + 3 H ( a ) . (g) Desorption of carbon dioxide: (18) 2 CO 2 * ( a ) ↔ 2 CO 2 + 2 ( a ) . (h) Molecular rearrangement of adsorbed hydrogen: (19) 6 H * ( a ) ↔ 3 H 2 * ( a ) + 3 ( a ) . (i) Desorption of hydrogen: (20) 3 H 2 * ( a ) ↔ 3 H 2 + 3 ( a ) . Elementary steps 18–20 were not used in developing any model. Similarly, the following elementary steps were used in developing models based on ER mechanism: (a) Molecular adsorption of crude ethanol on the catalyst active site: (21) C 2 H 6 O + ( a ) ↔ C 2 H 6 O ( a ) . (b) Dissociation of adsorbed crude ethanol into hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon fractions: (22) C 2 H 6 O ( a ) + ( a ) ↔ CH 2 O ( a ) + CH 4 ( a ) . (c) Surface reaction of adsorbed oxygenated hydrocarbon fraction with non-adsorbed water vapor: (23) CH 2 O ( a ) + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 ( a ) + 2 H 2 . (d) Surface reaction of adsorbed hydrocarbon fraction with non-adsorbed steam: (24) CH 4 ( a ) + 2 H 2 O ↔ CO 2 ( a ) + 4 H 2 . (e) Desorption of adsorbed C to regenerate the active site: (25) 2 CO 2 ( a ) ↔ 2 CO 2 + 2 ( a ) , where a = adsorbed species . On the whole, six LHHW and five ER models were formulated and tested. All the rate models, and the assumptions used in their derivation are given in Table 1 . The discrimination of the plausible models was based on predictive efficiency (i.e., the average absolute deviation (AAD%)) between predicted and experimental results and the similarity in activation energy value with that obtained from the power law model."
3,Numerical modeling,"2.2 Numerical modeling The theoretical numerical model used for modeling and simulating the performance of the packed bed tubular reactor (PBTR) consists of mass and energy balance equations developed by carrying out steady state mass and enthalpy balances around the reactor in the presence of pseudo-homogenous chemical reaction as documented in Bird et al. (2002). Most of the works reported on the simulation of packed bed catalytic reactors made use of some simplifying assumption in order to force these material and energy balance equations into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is done to facilitate analytical solution of the ODEs (Aboudheir et al., 2006). According to these authors, these assumptions could lead to marked deviations in the predicted and experimental results when there is significant heat contribution from the reaction. We had earlier shown that incorporating the axial dispersion term in the model helps improve the model predictive efficiency, and thus, simplifying the equations into ODE is not recommended. The reactor model in this work is intended to show the need to include the axial dispersion term in reactor modeling and simulation. Reasonable assumption included in our mathematical model are pseudo-homogeneous chemical phase, constant density, constant velocity and wall temperature, negligible pressure drop (i.e., no momentum balance), and the fact that species exhibit ideal gas behavior and negligible diffusion resistance. Based on the reactor geometry illustrated in Fig. 1 , the model equations for each of the component species i can be expressed in the radial and axial directions in the cylindrical coordinate system as given in Eqs. (37) and (38) for mass and energy balance equations, respectively: (37) D eff ∂ 2 C i ∂ r 2 + 1 r ∂ C i ∂ r + D eff ∂ 2 C i ∂ z 2 + ρ b r i = v ∂ C i ∂ z , (38) ( Δ H i ) ρ b r i ( r , z ) + λ eff ∂ 2 T ( r , z ) ∂ r 2 + 1 r ∂ T ( r , z ) ∂ r + λ eff ∂ 2 T ( r , z ) ∂ z 2 = ρ g C p v ∂ T ( r , z ) ∂ z . Considering the geometry of the PBTR used for the experimental work, the applicable boundary conditions for the material and energy balance equations are as given in (39) C i ( r , 0 ) = C i 0 , T ( r , 0 ) = T 0 at z = 0 and 0 ⩽ r ⩽ r 1 , (40) ∂ C i ∂ r ( 0 , z ) = 0 , ∂ T ∂ r ( 0 , z ) = 0 at r = 0 and 0 ⩽ z ⩽ L , (41) ∂ C i ∂ r ( r 1 , z ) = 0 , λ eff ∂ T ∂ r ( r 1 , z ) = - U tw ( T - T 0 ) at r = r 1 and 0 ⩽ z ⩽ L . At the outlet of the reactor, it can be assumed that the convective part of the mass and heat transport is dominating (Aboudheir et al., 2006). The material balance equation can be transformed into a molar flow rate format as given in (42) v ∂ N i ∂ z = D eff ∂ 2 N i ∂ r 2 + D eff r ∂ N i ∂ r + D eff ∂ 2 N i ∂ z 2 + ρ B vAr i . The resulting partial differential equations were solved simultaneously using the finite elements technique subject to these initial and boundary conditions in the form given above (Eqs. (38) and (42)) without any simplifying assumptions as reported by Aboudheir et al. (2006)."
4,Experimental details,
5,Catalyst and feed material,"3.1 Catalyst and feed material The catalyst used in this work was a nickel based commercial catalyst obtained from REB Research and Consulting, Ferndale, MI, USA. This catalyst exhibited a high hydrogen selectivity as well as good activity and stability in terms of crude ethanol conversion over a relatively long time on stream as shown in Fig. 2 . The crude ethanol used for the experiment was obtained from Pound Maker Agventures, Lanigan, Saskatchewan, Canada. The sample was a concentrated stream collected from a point on the recycling line carrying the reflux portion from the top of the distillation column back into the column. The crude ethanol was analyzed by HPLC for the composition and the results are presented in Table 2 . Based on this result, the molecular formula of the mixture was found to be C 2.17 H 6.14 O 1.35 . Thus, the stoichiometric equation for the reforming of concentrated crude ethanol based on the derived molecular formula can be written as in (43) C 2.17 H 6.14 O 1.35 + 2.99 H 2 O ↔ 2.17 CO 2 + 6.06 H 2 ."
6,"Experimental apparatus, procedures and analysis","3.2 Experimental apparatus, procedures and analysis Experimental kinetic data for the steam reforming of crude ethanol to produce hydrogen were carried out using a conventional catalytic PBTR operated isothermally at atmospheric pressure. The 8mm i.d. stainless steel reactor used for collecting kinetic data was BTRS (model number: 02250192-1) obtained from Autoclave Engineers, Quebec. The reactor was encased in an electric furnace controlled by a programmable temperature controller. Crude ethanol was fed by means of a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump regulated at the desired flow rates. The reaction temperature was measured with a sliding thermocouple dipped inside the catalyst bed. The error in temperature measurement was within ± 1 K . A typical run for the reforming of crude ethanol was performed as follows: 0.1–1.0g of the Ni-based commercial catalyst was crushed and sieved to an average particle size of 0.6mm and mixed with Pyrex glass (inert material) of the same average particle size and loaded into the reactor. The total catalyst bed height was 53mm. The feed consisting of crude ethanol (comprising ethanol plus other organics and water) was then pumped at the desired flow rate (i.e., space velocity) to the vaporizer maintained at 523K before entering the reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was activated by in situ reduction with 5% H 2 / N 2 gas (supplied by PRAXAIR, Regina, SK, Canada) flowing at 1.67 × 10 - 6 m 3 / s for 7200s. The reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure and the temperature range of 673–863K. A detailed schematic of the laboratory experimental skid is presented in Fig. 3 . The exit mixture from the reactor was passed through a condenser and a gas–liquid separator to separate the gaseous and liquid for further analysis. The qualitative analysis of the liquid product was done using a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) technique as documented elsewhere (Akande et al., 2005). The liquid product was analyzed quantitatively using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system, Agilent 1100 series model supplied by Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware, USA. A typical analysis was done by suitably diluting the liquid mixture with nanopure water and filtering it using a 0.2 μ m syringe filter. The components of the liquid were then separated in a 250 × 4.1 mm HC-75 H + column supplied by Hamilton Company, Nevada, USA maintained at 348K and eluted using 0.55mM succinic acid as the mobile phase at the rate of 1 150 cm 3 / s . The eluted components were detected by a refractive index detector. The composition of the reformer gas product was analyzed on-line by gas chromatography (Model HP 6890) using molecular sieve and Haysep columns equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with helium as the carrier gas."
7,Kinetic data collection,"Experimental runs to collect intrinsic kinetic data were conducted at reaction temperatures of 673, 763, and 863K and W / N A O ratios ranging from 3472.22 to 34722.22kgcats/kmolcrude. It is important to state that the calculation of weight of catalyst excludes the weight of the diluents added to catalyst while making the catalyst bed. Before choosing the above stated conditions, preliminary experiments and some theoretical calculations were carried out to determine the regime of operating conditions that will guarantee intrinsic kinetic data collection in order to eliminate film and molecular diffusion as reported by Idem and Bakhshi (1996). In addition, in order to ensure plug flow conditions (i.e., zero radial velocity and temperature profile), absence of back mixing, and absence of channeling, certain criteria reported by Froment and Bischoff (1990), and Rase (1987) in their work were implemented. These criteria are: (1) ratio of catalyst bed height to catalyst particle size ( L r / d p ) ⩾ 50 , and (2) ratio of internal diameter of the reactor to the catalyst particle size ( d / d p ) ⩾ 10 . In this work, we used L r / d p and d / d p of 88.33 and 13.33, respectively, which met all the requirements for plug flow."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Heat and mass transport limitations,"5.1 Heat and mass transport limitations Kinetic data collection in any experiment can only be considered to be intrinsic in the absence of heat and mass transport limitations. Several correlations are available in literature to determine the effects interparticle and intraparticle heat and mass transport limitations could have on the rate of reaction. In this work, such effects were investigated at a temperature of 863K; the highest temperature used for the reaction essentially as reported by Ibrahim and Idem (2006) because the severest heat and mass transport resistances occur at the highest temperature of the reaction, if at all it exists. 5.1.1 Heat transport effects The internal pore heat transfer resistance was estimated using the Prater analysis given by (44) Δ T max , particle = D eff ( C As - C Ac ) ( Δ H r ) λ eff , where Δ T max , particle is the upper limit to temperature variation between pellet center and its surface, Δ H r is the heat of reaction, C As and C Ac are, respectively, the concentrations at the pellet surface and center (assumed, respectively, to be same as bulk concentration and zero, as suggested by Levenspiel, 1999), D eff is the effective mass diffusivity obtained from D eff = ( D AB ε / τ ) (Fogler, 1999) where D AB is the bulk diffusivity of component A in B (i.e., ethanol in water), which in turn, is estimated using Brokaw equation (Perry and Green, 1997). The value for D AB was found at the maximum temperature of 863K to be 4.73 × 10 - 5 m 2 / s . The effective diffusivity D eff was estimated to be 2.95 × 10 - 6 m 2 / s . ε is the void fraction (estimated as the ratio of the volume occupied by voids to the total bed volume = 0.5 ), τ is the tortuosity factor taken as 8 (Fogler, 1999), λ eff is the effective thermal conductivity obtained using the correlation, λ eff / λ = 5.5 + 0.05 N Re (Walas, 1990) for packed bed tubular reactors. λ is the molecular thermal conductivity calculated using Wassiljewa correlation to be 8.57 × 10 - 5 kJ / m s K (Perry and Green, 1997). The effective thermal conductivity λ eff was found to be 9.3 × 10 - 3 kJ / m s K . A value of 0.2K was obtained for Δ T max , particle which shows that the pellet more or less had a uniform temperature. The heat transfer limitation across the gas film was determined using (45) Δ T max , film = L ( - r A , obs ) ( Δ H i ) h , where Δ T max , film is the upper limit of temperature difference between the gas bulk and the pellet surface, L is the characteristic length, r A , obs is the observed rate of reaction, h is the heat transfer coefficient (estimated from the correlation J H = J D = ( h / C p ν ρ ) N 2 / 3 where J H is the heat transfer J factor, and N Pr = C p μ / λ ). J D factor is given by the following correlations J D = ( 0.4548 / ε ) N Re - 0.4069 and ( k c / v ) N Sc 2 / 3 (Geankoplis, 2003); N Sc = ( μ / ρ D AB ) , N Re = ρ ν d p / μ ( 1 - ε ) . k c is the mass transfer coefficient obtained to be 0.33m/s based on the J factor analogy. The heat transfer coefficient h was determined to be 0.57 kJ / m 2 K s . A value of 0.4K was obtained for Δ T max , film . These results confirm the absence of heat transfer limitations externally and internally. These led us to assume isothermal operation conditions during the reaction (Levenspiel, 1999). Additionally, a more rigorous criterion for determining the onset of heat transport limitation during reaction which was developed by Mears (1971) was also used to further ascertain the absence of heat transfer resistance as given in (46) r obs ρ b R c E ( Δ H ) hT 2 R < 0.15 . On substituting the numerical values for the terms on the left-hand side (LHS) of Eq. (46) a value of 0.02 is obtained which is less than 0.15. Hence, heat transport limitation did not set in. 5.1.2 Mass transport effects The internal pore mass transfer resistance was calculated using Weisz–Prater criterion as given by (47) C wp , ipd = - r A , obs ρ c R c 2 D eff C As , where C wp , ipd is the Weisz–Prater criterion for internal pore diffusion, ρ c the pellet density, R c catalyst radius. The estimated value for C wp , ipd was 0.071. This value is much less than 1. Thus, this result indicates that the concentration on the catalyst surface is more or less the same as the concentration within its pores. According to Fogler (1999), this result is obtained as a consequence of the absence of internal pore diffusion limitations. To determine whether film mass transfer resistance has any effect on the rate of reaction, the ratio of observed rate to the rate if film resistance controls was examined. Eq. (48) illustrates this criterion: (48) observed rate rate if film resistance controls = - r A , obs C Ab k c d p 6 . The estimated value for the ratio in Eq. (48) was 2.5 × 10 - 6 . The result indicates that the observed rate is very much less than the limiting film mass transfer rate. Thus, the resistance to film mass transfer should not influence the rate of reaction (Levenspiel, 1999). Mears’ criterion (Fogler, 1999) is often considered a more rigorous criterion for determining the onset of mass transport limitation in the film. Therefore, we decided to apply this criterion to determine if there was any mass transfer limitation during the collection of the kinetic data. This correlation is given in (49) r obs ρ b R c n k c C A < 0.15 . The value of the LHS of the equation is 5.7 × 10 - 3 which is far less than the right-hand side of the equation. Therefore, it can be concluded that there was no mass transport limitation in the film. It should be noted that the chemical and physical properties of crude ethanol/water mixture used for simulation were based on that of a pure ethanol/water mixture. This is due to the negligible contributions of the other components to the physical and chemical properties of the mixture because the concentrations of lactic acid and glycerol were negligible. 5.1.3 Catalyst evaluation and experimental rates The catalyst activity was evaluated in terms of stability with regard to time on stream, hydrogen selectivity and crude ethanol conversion as follows: (50) Crude ethanol conversion ( X ) = kmol(organics) in - kmol(organics) out kmol(organics) in . Organics here refer to ethanol + lactic acid + glycerol + maltose . Fig. 2 gives the plot of crude ethanol conversion versus time on stream. The plot reveals that the catalyst was relatively stable over 21600min. Also, material balance was performed for a selected number of runs and the overall recovery was > 95 % in all the cases. The experimental parameters and conditions used in collecting the kinetic data are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . The table also contains the variation in crude ethanol conversion with the change in the ratio of the weight of catalyst to crude ethanol flow ( W / N A 0 ) at reaction temperatures of 673, 763, and 863K. The plot of crude ethanol conversion ( X ) against W / N A 0 is shown in Fig. 4 . The experimental rates of reaction were obtained using the differential method of analysis from the conversions versus W / N A 0 plot as given in (51) d X d ( W / N A 0 ) = r A ."
10,Estimation of the parameters of the rate models and validation,"5.2 Estimation of the parameters of the rate models and validation Estimation of the values of the model parameters was based on the minimization of the sum of the residual squares of the reaction rates by Gauss–Newton and Levenberg–Marquardt methods using non-linear regression software, NLEG. The values obtained for the parameters of the kinetic models that converged as well as that of the power law are presented in Table 5 . The validation of the models was based on the determination of the percentage average absolute deviation (AAD%) between the predicted rate using proposed kinetic model and the experimentally observed rate. Out of the 11 models, only six converged and were initially short-listed. They were however subjected to further scrutiny by imposing the restriction that an acceptable model should have an AAD ⩽ 15 % with activation energy comparable to that of the power law model. These restrictions led to four models passing this test and they were finally short-listed as acceptable models predicting the CRCCE. These models, with suitable parameter estimate, predict the reaction product distribution quite well over the range of operating conditions used here and thus provide support for their corresponding mechanisms. Fig. 5 depicts how well the empirical model as well as the final short-listed models fitted the experimental data. It can be seen that models 3, 4 and 8 exhibited better fit than the empirical model with values of the activation energies within the same order of magnitude as the empirical model indicating that there is no change in mechanism between these mechanistic models and the power law model. Model 2 was rejected on the ground that its activation energy was not close to that of the power law model while model 9 was rejected on the basis of a higher than desired AAD% value. Judging from the predictability of the experimentally observed rate by the final kinetic models, it is uncertain to say which of the three mechanisms single, double or triple site coverage would represent what takes place during CRCCE at high concentration of crude ethanol except further experimentation is conducted. However, on the basis of the availability of the number of active sites required at the rate determining step, it is most certain that the single site mechanism will be the most probable mechanism and the least energy will be required for generation of the active site. This reasoning provides the rational for choosing the single site mechanism as the most plausible model. Akande (2005) and Akande et al. (2006) had earlier reported a dual site coverage mechanism which supports the dual site proposition. However, this was based on a widely different concentration of feed components as well as different types of catalysts for the two studies. It is worth noting that CRCCE has not been widely investigated. Hence, there are scant reports on the activation energy value. The only reports available are those of Akande and co-workers (Akande, 2005; Akande et al., 2006). The difference between the mechanism reported in that study and the present work is in the activation energy and rate determining step (rds). The reported activation energies for both their mechanistic and power law models were in the order of 10 3 while the activation energies for our models (both mechanistic and power law) are in the order of 10 4 . This is expected because different catalysts exhibit different interaction on a common substrate. Also, the presence or absence of mass and heat transfer effect was not ascertained using the rigorous calculations presented in this work. It is likely that the low value of the activation energy reported in that work is due to the presence of mass and heat transfer resistances. Although, the values of activation energies reported in the literature for pure ethanol steam reforming have been in the order of 10 3 – 10 5 J / mol , it remains to be rigorously verified whether or not the lower end of values reported are due to mass and heat transfer resistances, as was done in this work using established correlations. The kinetic model with the best fit was obtained by assuming the adsorption of ethanol as the rds which is different from that proposed by Akande (2005) and Akande et al. (2006). Other works on pure ethanol steam system have strongly supported the surface reaction of oxametallacycle as the rds. However, the presence of other compounds in the feed could possibly affect the reaction mechanism. As reported by Vaidya and Rodrigues (2006a), the reaction order with respect to ethanol in CSRE is in the range of 1 and 2.52. However, Akande et al. (2006) reported a reaction order of 0.43 with respect to crude ethanol. Fitting our experimental data into the same form of empirical model gave a reaction order of 3.6 wrt crude ethanol. This may be attributed to a difference in mechanism due to catalyst type, and the presence or absence of heat and mass transfer resistances."
11,Simulation of CRCCE using theoretical model,"5.3 Simulation of CRCCE using theoretical model The parameters of the theoretical model (material and energy balance equations) used in simulating the production of hydrogen from crude ethanol reforming are given in Table 6 . These properties are based on those of a pure ethanol/water mixture because of the negligible contributions of the other components to the physical and chemical properties of the mixture since the concentrations of lactic acid and glycerol are considered negligible. These parameters were used in the material balance and energy balance equations (Eqs. (38) and (42)), respectively, to simulate the reactor at 763K and W / N A 0 of 34722kgcats/kmolcrude. The solution of the sets of resulting partial differential equations after incorporating the mechanistic rate model 8 (i.e., single site mechanism (ER 1)) was carried out using the finite elements method subject to the initial and boundary conditions. The results of the outlet compositions of reactor predicted by the model are shown below (Table 7 ) and were compared with the values obtained experimentally by analyzing the outlet composition of the reactor using HPLC and GC. The result shows that our numerical model predicts the system with a high level of accuracy with an AAD of 1.28%. The concentration profiles of the species are shown in Fig. 6 ."
12,Predictive performance of the numerical model,"5.4 Predictive performance of the numerical model The objective of any numerical modeling and simulation of any system is to obtain a mathematical model that accurately describes what happens in the entire range of operating conditions. An acceptable model should be able to duplicate the real system with minimum and acceptable error. Thus, the model was used to predict crude ethanol conversion at various W / N A 0 and temperatures used in the experimental studies to ascertain the validity of our model. A comparison of the experimental and predicted conversions of crude ethanol is given in the parity plot in Fig. 7 , which reveals that the numerical model gives an excellent prediction of the experimental results ( AAD %= 4.28 ) ."
13,Effect of axial dispersion term,"5.5 Effect of axial dispersion term There has been series of arguments on whether the axial dispersion term has any significant contribution to the performance in a packed bed reactor model at certain reactor dimensions. For example, Carberry and Wendel (1963) and Hill (1977) suggested that if the ratio of catalyst bed length to catalyst particle diameter is greater than 100, then, the axial dispersion term could be disregarded. Also, Froment and Bischoff (1990) and Rase (1987) suggested that the axial dispersion term is negligible when the catalyst bed height exceeds the particle diameter by 50. However, Aboudheir et al. (2006) showed from simulation studies that these criteria are not always true, and therefore should be further investigated in any particular case before it is being applied in setting up the model. Even though when these criteria are employed, they predicted an approximate plug flow behavior (i.e., almost flat radial conversion and temperature profiles in both cases), the radial variation in conversion and temperature can be very pronounced in an industrial scale reactor, as was pointed out by Aboudheir et al. (2006). Also, the simulated results shown in Figs. 8 and 9 slightly under-predicts the radial conversion and temperature profiles of fluid in the reactor when the axial dispersion term is neglected. Aboudheir et al. (2006) stated that the extent of this under-prediction depends on the ratio of v / D eff . In addition, the axial mixing term enhances the conversion of the reactants to product by maintaining a high reaction temperature simultaneous with the promotion of mixing of the reactants as they proceed along the bed which brings them into good contact thereby leading to increased conversion (Mostoufi et al., 2005). In a similar way, the axial mixing term in the energy balance equation is a heat transfer term. Therefore, the elimination of this term would mean neglecting a significant enhancement in heat transfer in the process. An enhanced rate of heat transfer as the fluid travels down the bed provides the heat thereby maintaining the high temperature necessary for the conversion of the reactant species to product. The rapid heat transfer also helps to maintain the heat along the reactor length thereby avoiding a sharp drop that could occur caused by an increase in conversion promoted by axial mixing. Basically, the axial dispersion term comprises a thermal conductivity term and a gradient term (Eq. (38)) as presented by Walas (1991). The former is always positive whereas the later could be positive or negative depending on the nature of the reaction. In an endothermic reaction, the temperature gradient is negative and this makes the term behave opposite to the other terms on the right hand side and therefore a heat contributing term rather than a heat absorption term. This term is a second differential term implying that it makes minimal contribution. However, when combined with the multiplier in the equation (i.e., the effective thermal conductivity), the contribution could be significant. The amount of heat contributed largely depends on the value of the effective thermal conductivity. For a system with high effective thermal conductivity, the heat transfer rate is high. This helps maintain the process temperature even though the reaction is consuming heat as it proceeds along the length of the reactor. The reverse will take place in an exothermic reaction where the gradient is positive. Also, the degree of under prediction is a function of the steepness of the axial temperature profile. This shows that even when these well documented criteria have been met by the experimental conditions, the axial dispersion term should only be disregarded after a careful comparison between the results obtained with and without its inclusion in the model equation have been made."
14,Simulation of effect of reactor length and W / N A 0,"5.6 Simulation of effect of reactor length and W / N A 0 To reduce the additional cost that would be incurred in separating the unconverted reactants from the products, it is essential to design a reactor that will give high conversion of reactants. This can be achieved by either increasing the catalyst bed length or by increasing W / N A 0 , both resulting in a decrease in space velocity of the reacting species in the PBTR. The effect of increase in length on conversion was simulated by increasing the catalyst bed length from 53 to 75mm at temperature range of 573–1063K and fixed W / N A 0 of 3121.5s. The results of the simulation are shown in Fig. 10 . These results show that a substantial benefit in conversion is obtained by increasing the temperature from 563 to 763K but a further increase in temperature to 1063K is not beneficial as the reaction is completed at a 20mm bed-length. The common characteristic exhibited by an endothermic reaction is that, they tend to be more reversible at lower temperatures. Hence, high temperatures favor irreversibility and high conversion. The plot further shows that there is almost a monotonic increase in conversion from the inlet to the exit of the reactor at a temperature of 573K. Also, there is a substantial additional increase in conversion on increasing the temperature in steps of 100 ∘ C . However, it can be seen in Fig. 10 that the benefit in additional conversion achieved with further increase in length of the catalyst bed height diminishes as the temperature increases. At temperatures > 763 K , there is no benefit to increase the catalyst bed height since the maximum conversion is already attained at the operating catalyst bed height. Similarly, the effect of increase in W / N A 0 on conversion was investigated at a fixed bed-length of 53mm and temperature of 763K in the range. The W / N A 0 (s) used for the investigation were 624.3, 3121.5 and 6867.4s and the corresponding conversions were 0.54, 0.87 and 0.97, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen that decreasing the flow rate leads to an improvement in conversion. However, at all the flow rates investigated, 90% of the final conversion is attained at a bed depth of 30mm. It therefore means that only 10% additional conversion could be achieved by the later 23mm bottom bed depth. Also, as can be seen from Fig. 11, there is still an increase in conversion with catalyst bed height even though the rate of increase is slower at higher space velocities (higher flow rates). When the three flow rates are compared, we can see that substantial benefit is derived in terms of higher conversion by reducing the flow rate. The simulated results reveal that there are limits as to which these two variables (temperature and flow rate) can be adjusted to obtain meaningful benefit and any design should seek to establish these ceilings."
15,Simulation of the axial temperature profile,5.7 Simulation of the axial temperature profile Fig. 12 shows the axial temperature profile for a run at W / N A 0 = 624.3 s and feed temperature of 763K. This figure shows the occurrence of a rapid drop in temperature from the feed entrance at the top of the catalyst bed to a bed depth of about 45mm after which it slows down and finally levels off towards the exit of the catalyst bed. This is a reflection of the slowing down of the conversion of the feed as it travels down the catalyst bed resulting from the reduction in the concentration of the reactant species.
16,Conclusions,"Kinetic models have been formulated for the production of hydrogen by the catalytic reforming of concentrated crude ethanol over a nickel-based commercial catalyst. The experimental data supplied was obtained for W / N A 0 in the range of 62.43–624.3s at atmospheric pressure and within the temperature range of 673–863K. Four of 11 detailed kinetic models developed using ER and LHHW mechanism gave an excellent prediction of the kinetic data and the average absolute deviations from the experimental data ranged from 3.7% to 9.12 %. Furthermore, a comprehensive reactor modeling was formulated to simulate the production of hydrogen by the catalytic reforming of concentrated crude ethanol over a nickel-based commercial catalyst at the temperature of 763K using the material and energy balance equations for packed bed catalytic reactor. The mathematical model was able to predict the concentration profiles of the species in both the radial and axial directions with high accuracy. Our modeling result shows that simplifying assumptions as has been done in most of the published works on the simulation of packed bed tubular reactor are capable of giving deceptive results."
