0,Introduction,"The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen (H2) via photocatalytic water splitting, is considered as a green approach for resolving the energy crisis and environmental issues (Fujishima et al., 2000; Maeda and Domen, 2010; Staffell et al., 2019). However, the significant challenges of photocatalytic water splitting are to utilize the whole solar spectrum and to develop efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The n-type semiconductors such as cadmium sulfide (CdS) have intensively been studied due to their suitable bandgap (~2.4 eV) and an appropriate band-alignment with water oxidation/reduction potentials (Kudo and Miseki, 2009). However, the preparation of CdS with controlled shape, size, crystallinity, and phase structure to achieve an enhanced and stable HER rate is a challenge (Jia et al., 2020). The unique one dimensional (1-D) CdS nanostructures are promising candidates for the photocatalytic H2 evolution due to their high aspect ratio, structure, and excellent optical properties (Tang et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2020). Furthermore, 1-D nanostructure enhances solar light absorption and scattering properties because of the small radial distance for charge-carrier diffusion, resulting in the suppression of photogenerated e−/h+ recombination (Garg et al., 2019). However, the CdS is not stable against photocorrosion for prolonged light irradiation. The sacrificial reagents (SRs) such as S2− and/or SO3 2− reduce the photocorrosion of CdS by scavenging the photogenerated holes before they oxidize the CdS (Jang et al., 2007). Moreover, the heterostructures of CdS with other semiconductors having favorable band-edge potentials could also improve its stability. The heterostructures can be synthesized through doping (Zhang et al., 2015), construction of heterojunctions (M. Wang et al., 2018), co-catalysts (Chen et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2020), etc. In this respect, the integration of CdS with metal-free, inexpensive, and green materials such as CQD in a simple way is highly desired (Chen et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2006). The CQD, an emerging photo-luminescent nanomaterial, has received a great research interest since 2004 owing to its unique properties of photoluminescence (PL), low toxicity, and excellent photostability with zero-dimensional nanostructures of <10 nm size (Xu et al., 2004). Besides, CQD is considered a promising photocatalyst due to its superior electron-donating properties and excellent charge transfer characteristics (Z. Zhao et al., 2018). To synthesize CQD, various techniques have been employed by using carbon sources such as citric acid (Martindale et al., 2015), ethylene glycol (C. Wang et al., 2018), urea (Simões et al., 2016), etc. The CQD can also be synthesized by utilizing renewable and abundant biomass (Meng et al., 2019). The carbon sources such as fruits and their peels (Aggarwal et al., 2020), almond husk (Tripathi et al., 2016), animals and animal derivatives (Feng et al., 2016), human derivatives (Sun et al., 2013), vehicle pollutant soot (Devi et al., 2018), etc. are carbonized to achieve cost-effective and eco-friendly CQD. Recently, Das et al. derived CQD (Das et al., 2019) and graphene nanosheets (Das et al., 2020) from biomass (pear juice) and used in various applications such as the detection of Fe and ascorbic acid, and the water splitting under visible light irradiation. The incorporation of CQD onto semiconductors such as g-C3N4 (Liu et al., 2015), TiO2 (Yu et al., 2014), CdS (Jiang et al., 2018), BiVO4 (Tang et al., 2013), KNbO3 (Qu et al., 2018), Cu2O (Li et al., 2012), WO2-NaxWO3 (J. Zhao et al., 2018), ZnO (Alam et al., 2020) was carried out to retain the photostability. The application of CQD synthesized from bio-waste materials for the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction is a prudent area of research; nevertheless, it is not yet reported in the open literature. In the present study, green fluorescent CQD was synthesized from orange peels and loaded onto the 1-D CdS via the chemical adsorption method. The synthesized photocatalysts were tested for the water-splitting reaction to generate H2, under visible light illumination. The effect of operating parameters such as photocatalyst concentration and CQD loading on CdS on the H2 production rate was investigated. The highest H2 production rate of 309 mmol g−1h−1 was observed with CQD/CdS. The reusability of CQD/CdS and bare CdS was also examined in three repeat experiments and observed a stable operation with CQD/CdS. The possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic water splitting was proposed on the basis of electron trapping by the CQD on the surface of CdS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to utilize the CQD synthesized from the waste biomass for the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction and reported >300 mmol g−1h−1 of H2 production rate which is the highest among the reported rates in the open literature using similar catalysts."

Deionized water (DI water) was obtained from a Millipore water purification unit (Elix-3 Milli-Q, Millipore, The USA)."
3,Synthesis of CQD from orange peels,"2.2 Synthesis of CQD from orange peels Carbon quantum dots (CQD) were synthesized by the hydrothermal method using orange peels following a previously reported procedure (Ettefaghi et al., 2018). Firstly, orange peels were sun-dried for 2–3 days and then prepared powder with the help of a grinder-mixer. Typically, 1 g of orange peel powder was mixed with 40 mL water and stirred for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. This solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h under hydrothermal conditions. After cooled down to room temperature, the solution was centrifuged at the rate of 5000 rpm to separate the precipitates from the solution. The solution was then freeze-dried to obtain CQD powder (2–10 nm). The yield of CQD was 10 wt% (0.1 g per g of dry orange peel)."
4,Synthesis of CdS nanowires,"2.3 Synthesis of CdS nanowires CdS nanowires were synthesized by a solvothermal method according to a previous report (Wang et al., 2019). 1.6 g of cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O) and 1.19 g of thiourea (CH4N2S) was dissolved in 25 mL ethylenediamine and stirred for 1 h to get a homogeneous solution. Then, the above mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, and the solvothermal reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 72 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product (CdS) was separated from the solution by centrifugation (5000 rpm and 10 min) and washed with distilled water and ethanol several times. Lastly, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C to get CdS."
5,Synthesis of CQD/CdS,"2.4 Synthesis of CQD/CdS CQD/CdS were prepared using a simple chemical deposition method. Firstly, the prepared CQD was dispersed in DI water to obtain a 1 mg mL−1 solution in a beaker. Then, 1 g CdS was mixed in the desired CQD solution and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The obtained powder was then collected by centrifugation and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. Various CQD/CdS photocatalysts with different mass fractions (0.25, 0.4, 0.5, and 1 wt%) were synthesized using the above-mentioned technique."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on X-ray diffractometer (Model: SmartLab, Make: Rigaku, Japan) using Ni filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) in the range of 2θ from 10° to 80° with a step size of 0.5° and a scan speed of 0.05 s/step. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy analysis was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Model: ESCALAB Xi+, Make: Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) with non-monochromatic twin anode. The working pressure of argon, pass energy and electron take-off angle was ~3 × 10−9 mBar, 20 eV and 55°, respectively. The full width at the half maximum of Au4f7/2 was 0.8 eV. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) were recorded to determine the optical absorbance using UV–Vis spectrometer (Model: UV-2600, Make: Shimadzu, Japan) with BaSO4 as the reference standard. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were collected using FESE microscope (Model: JSM–7610F, Make: JEOL, Japan) with an electron acceleration voltage of 15 kV. Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) was performed (Model: JEM 2100F, Make: JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) were obtained (Model: Sigma, Make: Zeiss, Germany) for the surface elemental analysis. N2 sorption data were collected using a Micromeritics instrument (Model: Tristar–II 3020, Make: Micromeritics, USA) in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.25. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to determine the functional groups (Model: IR Affinity 1, Make: Shimadzu, Japan). Raman spectra were collected using Laser Micro-Raman spectrometer (Model: LabRAM HR–800, Make: Horiba Jobin Vyon, Japan) with 532 nm Ar laser excitation. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded on the fluorescence spectrophotometer (Model: Fluoromax–4, Make: Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan) with an excitation light of 400 nm wavelength. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were recorded (Model: Lifespec II, Make: Eddinburg Instruments, UK). Photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out in a three-electrode configuration (Model: PGSTAT 302 N, Make: Metrohm, Utrecht, The Netherlands) at room temperature using the catalyst coated FTO glass, platinum and Ag/AgCl (saturated 3 M KCl solution) as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. Thin-film working electrodes (with area 1 × 1 cm2) were prepared by photocatalyst spin coating onto FTO glass followed by overnight drying at 60 °C. The current density as a function of voltage was measured using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the presence and absence of light. A 400 W metal halide lamp (Halonix Technologies Pvt. Ltd., India) was used as the light source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and capacitance studies were conducted on the same Autolab instrument in the frequency range from 10−2 to 104 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV AC signal. Mott-Schottky plots were measured in a potential range of 0 to 1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a frequency of 1000 Hz in the presence and absence of light. Prior to all experiments, the reaction media was purged with N2 gas to remove dissolved oxygen. The thermal behavior of CQDs was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Model: TG 209 F1, Make: Netzsch, Germany). The analysis was carried out in the presence of N2 as an inert atmosphere from 30 to 700 °C in a dynamic mode with a ramp rate of 10 K/min."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction Photocatalytic HER experiments were carried out in a gas-tight quartz reactor of 100 cm3 capacity, under visible light irradiation (Gogoi et al., 2020). In a typical experiment, the required quantity of photocatalyst was suspended in a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3 as a sacrificial reagent (SR). The suspension was sonicated for 10 min before the reaction to avoid the catalyst particle aggregation. Prior to each photocatalytic experiment, the solution was degassed flowing N2 at 30 mL min−1 for 30 min. The suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The 400 W metal halide lamp (with UV blocking) was used as the light source. The solution temperature was controlled at room temperature by using a water circulation system. All the photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a black box to prevent interference of stray light. The generated H2 was analyzed at every 10 min using an inline gas chromatograph (Model: 7890A, Make: Agilent, The USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a CP-Molsieves 5A column. The argon was used as the carrier gas. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated using the formula given below: A Q Y % = N u m b e r o f r e a c t e d e l e c t r o n s N u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 (1) = 2 × N u m b e r o f H 2 m o l e c u l e e v o l v e d p e r h o u r N u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s p e r h o u r × 100"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization 3.1.1 Structural analysis X-ray diffraction study: The XRD patterns of bare CdS and CQD/CdS are shown in Fig. 1 . The peaks at 24.8, 26.5, 28.2 36.6, 43.7, 47.8, 50.9, 51.8, 52.8, 58.6, 66.8, 69.3, 70.9 and 75.5° 2θ values were due to the diffraction from the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (202), (203), (210), (211) and (105) planes of CdS, respectively (Chen et al., 2018). In the case of CQD/CdS, no additional peaks corresponding to CQD were observed, even at higher loading of CQD. This may be due to a very low concentration of CQD (≤1 wt%) and/or high crystalline nature of CdS compared to CQD (Pei et al., 2016; Z. Zhao et al., 2018). In addition, no impurity peaks were observed in the XRD pattern of CQD/CdS (Chen et al., 2018). Besides, all XRD peaks (Fig. S1) after CQD doping were slightly shifted to the lower 2θ angle, indicating the doping of CQD into the lattice of CdS (Chai et al., 2018; Dey and Das, 2017). The XRD pattern of CQD (Fig. S2a) exhibited one peak centered at 21° and one less intense peak at 42° corresponding to the planes (002) and (101), respectively, of highly disordered graphitic carbon (Patra et al., 2018). XPS analyses: The XPS spectra of CdS and the 0.4CQD/CdS were shown in Fig. 2 to study the elemental composition and chemical states. The peaks corresponding to Cd 3d, S 2p, C 1s, and O 1s elements were observed in wide survey scans (Fig. 2a). The high-resolution Cd 3d spectrum for bare CdS was fitted with two peaks at 404.9 and 411.7 eV (Fig. 2b), corresponding to the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 spin–orbit, respectively, confirming the presence of Cd2+ in CdS (Wu et al., 2006). The spectrum of S 2p of bare CdS (Fig. 2c) peaks at 161.3 and 162.4 eV corresponds to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, with splitting energy of 1.1 eV, resembled the valance state of S2− in CdS. The 0.4CQD/CdS exhibited a similar trend for both Cd 3d and S 2p spectrum, but the corresponding peaks of Cd 3d and S 2p were shifted towards lower binding energies. The negative shift of binding energy peaks of Cd 3d and S 2p confirmed the increase of electron density of CdS, ascribing a strong chemical interaction between CQD and CdS (Zhang et al., 2020), consistent with XRD. The strong interaction enables an easy transfer of electrons from CdS to CQD (Ning et al., 2016). The high-resolution C 1s spectra of 0.4CQD/CdS revealed the surface functional groups on the CQD (Fig. 2d) in which the binding energies at 288.2 (11%), 286.7 (9.4%), 285.7 eV (33.6%) were attributed to OCO/COOH, CO/CO, and COH/COC bonds, respectively. The remaining binding energies at 284.7 (32.6%) and 284 eV (12.5%) corresponded to the CC/CH of sp3 and CC of sp2 carbon, revealing the presence of the graphite structure in CQD on the surface of CdS, consistent with FTIR analysis (Fig. S2e) (Tyagi et al., 2016; Yu and Kwak, 2012). The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra for 0.4CQD/CdS (Fig. 2e) exhibited three distinct peaks at 532.9 eV (25.9%), 531.8 eV (44.7%) and 530.9 eV (29.2%). These peaks can respectively be attributed to COH/COC, CO/Cd(OH)2/CdO, and CO/OH− group (Prasannan and Imae, 2013; Yousaf et al., 2017). The hydroxide interacted with CdS lattice forms CdO or Cd(OH)2 because of the spatial compatibility between the hydroxide group and sulfur (Bacaksiz et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2019). The atomic percentages of Cd, S, O, and C (Table S1) indicated the decrease of Cd and S atomic percentage upon CQD loading. 3.1.2 Spectroscopy analysis Uv–Vis spectra: A strong absorption threshold was exhibited by pure CdS at 530 nm (Fig. 3 a). The absorption threshold of the CQD/CdS did not shift significantly which may be due to only a small amount of CQD present on the surface of the CdS. The UV–Vis absorption intensity was the highest with pure CdS nanowires at wavelengths below 500 nm and was decreased with the increase of CQDs loading onto the CdS surface. This could be attributed to the coverage of CdS surface with CQD or the interaction of CQD with CdS which was confirmed by XPS analysis. A similar observation was made with other semiconductors such as graphene oxide upon deposition of CQD (Zheng et al., 2018). In addition, the light absorption of the CQD/CdS did not change in the visible spectral range. It confirmed the intact crystal structure of CdS even after the adsorption of CQD, similar to the above XRD result (Chen et al., 2018). However, the UV–Vis absorption of CQD (Fig. S2b) exhibited the highest peak at ~230 nm and ~300 nm in the UV region ascribed to ᴨ-ᴨ* (CC) and n-ᴨ* (CO) transitions, respectively, with a tail extending to the visible range (Yuan et al., 2016). The optical band gap energy (Eg) of the samples was calculated using the Tauc plot obtained from the Kubelka-Munk function (Murphy, 2007). The bandgap was measured by extrapolating the slope of the linear region to the photon energy axis (x-axis) as shown in Fig. 3a (dashed lines in the inset of Fig. 3a). A slight reduction in bandgap energy of 0.4CQD/CdS (2.3 eV) compared to bare CdS (2.35 eV) can be ascribed to the quantum confinement effect of CQD (Y. Wang et al., 2018). PL spectra: The PL intensity of the CQD/CdS was significantly lower than that of bare CdS (Fig. 3b), which implies the better separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the decrease of the recombination probability of photoexcited e−/h+ pairs. The 0.4CQD/CdS exhibited a higher separation efficiency than other CQD/CdS, in which the rapid transfer of electrons takes place from the CB of CdS to CQD (Zhao et al., 2014). Additionally, the strong PL emission behavior of CQD under 360 nm excitation showed a bright blue emission spectrum with a wavelength of 530 nm (Fig. S2c), indicating the fluorescent nature of CQD (Patra et al., 2018). The CQD images in the inset of Fig. S2c showed the light yellow color under visible light and blue color under UV irradiation at 360 nm excitation. Generally, CQD of 5 nm in size emits blue light when excited by UV and shorter wavelength lights in the visible range (Huang et al., 2019). Raman: To analyze the vibrational and structural properties of CdS and CQD/CdS, Raman spectra were used (Fig. 3c). The Raman spectra were dominated by the progression in the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode. The first peak was the A1 longitudinal optical (1LO) mode and the second one was the overtone of the LO mode (2LO). Two characteristic broad Raman peaks at 302.2 and 601.84 cm−1 were observed for pure CdS, that were assigned to the fundamental longitudinal optical (1LO) phonon and its overtone of the LO mode (2LO), respectively (Ahmed et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2007). In general, the intensity of longitudinal optical phonon mode (1LO) at 300 cm−1 is stronger compared to its overtone mode (2LO) at 600 cm−1 in bulk (CdS) 3-dimensional materials. However, in the present study, the trend was opposite (Fig. 3c), i.e., the intensity of 2LO was stronger than that of 1LO (higher integrated intensity ratio (I 2LO/I 1LO)). This phenomenon can be attributed to the anisotropic geometry and finite-size (<50 nm) of 1-dimensional CdS nanowires, which cause exciton-phonon coupling (EPC) (Fan et al., 2007; Xianghua et al., 2014). In 1-D CdS NWs the EPC is greatly strengthened due to the phonon confinement in the transverse directions and the transfer of elementary excitation in the longitudinal direction (Pan et al., 2005; Shen, 2002). Additionally, the decrease in the intensity of Raman peaks of CQD/CdS could be attributed to the surface coverage by CQD (Zhao et al., 2017). A slight blue-shift (at lower CQD loadings) and a red-shift (at higher CQD loadings) were noticed in the Raman bands at 300 as well as 600 cm−1 with the deposition of CQD on the CdS surface. This could be attributed to the partial replacement of sulfur by oxygen atoms in the CdS lattice and forming sulfur vacancies (Chuu et al., 1997; Sekhar et al., 2015), as observed from XRD and XPS analysis. The shifting was solute concentration-dependent due to the change in strain effects and/or lattice contraction with solute concentration (Chandramohan et al., 2010; Jostar. T et al., 2015). The Raman spectra of CQD was presented in Fig. S2d. The two characteristic Raman peaks centered at 1386 and 1593 cm−1 correspond to the D band and G band, respectively. The G band (which has E2g symmetry) is due to the in-plane bond-stretching modes of pairs of the sp2 hybridized carbon. The D band is due to the breathing mode of k-point phonons of A1g symmetry. This mode is not present in the perfect graphitic carbon and active only when the sample contains lattice defects and disorder (Ferrari and Robertson, 2000). Besides, the intensity ratio of D band to the G band (ID /IG ) is about 0.6, indicating the presence of amorphous carbon with fewer defects (Qiang et al., 2019). FTIR: The characteristic broad feature centred at around 3430 cm−1 and peak at 1641 cm−1 (Fig. 3d and Table S3) correspond to the stretching modes of the hydroxyl (OH) group and HOH bending vibration of water molecules, respectively. The peak at around 2900–2800 cm−1 assigned to CH stretching vibration and at 1550–1650 cm−1 corresponded to CC/CO stretching of aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, the intense peak in the range of 1070 cm−1 and 630 cm−1 belongs to COC stretching vibrations of ether and COH stretching modes of alcohol, emphasizing the hydrophilic behaviour of CQD (Pandian et al., 2011). The peaks corresponding to CdS in CQD/CdS were not altered, indicating that the induction of CQD into CdS hardly changes the chemical structure of CdS (Sachdev and Gopinath, 2015). The weak absorption band in both bare and CQD doped CdS NWs at around 2900–2850 cm−1 attributed to the CdO stretching vibration (Islam et al., 2015), which was also confirmed from XPS (Fig. 2e). FTIR spectra of pure CQD (Fig. S2e) showed the existence of peaks at around 2926 cm−1 and 1601 cm−1 which were attributed to the skeletal vibration of sp2 and sp3 CH bonds and CC or HOH bending vibration of water molecules, respectively. The peaks at 1391 cm−1 and 1060 cm−1 were assigned to the bending vibrations of COO−, and the CO/COC bands (Xu et al., 2019). The weak vibration band at around 1737 cm−1 ascribed to the CO carbonyl group. The existence of these oxygen-containing groups (carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and ether), as revealed from FTIR (Fig. S2e) and XPS (Fig. 2d,e), provide the CQD with good solubility in water (Pan et al., 2014). The presence of the OH groups on CQD reveals its ability to donate electrons during the photocatalytic reaction (Alarfaj et al., 2018). 3.1.3 Morphology The morphologies of bare CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS were investigated using FESEM and FETEM (Fig. 4 ). The CdS nanorods possess an average length of ~2–4 µm and an average diameter of ~30 nm (Fig. 4a). The induction of CQD on CdS did not change the structure of CdS (Fig. 4d), as also observed in XRD analysis. The HRTEM image of CdS showed clear lattice fringes, consistent with the (100) plane of the wurtzite phase (Fig. 4b). The CQD on CdS was not visible in HRTEM due to small size, low contrast, and amorphous nature (Sachdev and Gopinath, 2015). However, the HRTEM image of as-synthesized CQD in Fig. S2f,g showed the existence of 0.32 nm for (002) graphitic lattice planes, comparable to XRD pattern (Fig. S2a) confirming the successful synthesis of biomass CQD (Reckmeier et al., 2016). The SAED pattern of CQD/CdS revealed the amorphous nature of CQD (Fig. 4f) compare to pure CdS which clearly showed the single-crystal structure with one-dimensional morphology. The HRTEM and SAED patterns (Fig. 4a, b, and c) of bare CdS NWs revealed the well crystalline wurtzite phase of CdS NWs (Pei et al., 2016). While, the SAED patterns of the CQDs contain blurred ring structure due to its amorphous nature (Ramanan et al., 2018). The 0.4CQD/CdS showed a slight peak deviation in its SAED patterns (Fig. 4f), which could be attributed to the doping of amorphous CQD onto CdS NWs. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and BET-specific surface area of CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS were shown in Fig. S3a and Table S2, respectively. The little difference in surface area and the similar type IV isotherms indicates that CQD modification does not change the pore morphology of CdS. The pore size distribution from 2 to 20 nm confirmed the existence of mesopores (Fig. S3b). TGA curve showed weight loss between 210 °C and 510 °C in the case of 0.4CQD/CdS, revealing the slow decomposition of carbon present in CQD/CdS (Fig. S4) (Kumar et al., 2018). 3.1.4 Photoelectrochemical properties The transient photocurrent analysis was performed to investigate the charge separation efficiency of the materials. The photocurrent of the bare CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS was observed in chronoamperometry study (i-t) curves for light-on and -off cycles as shown in Fig. 5 a. The average photocurrent density of the 0.4CQD/CdS was 47.53 µA/cm2 at 1.23 V potential vs. RHE, which is about 2.0 times higher than that of bare CdS (24.37 µA/cm2) suggesting (i) an efficient separation of photogenerated e−/h+ pairs in CQD/CdS, and (ii) strong interaction of CQD with CdS for a faster charge transfer and higher separation, as also confirmed by XPS. The photo-quantum confinement effect of CQD helps in transferring the electrons from the CdS to CQD under visible light irradiation (Sciortino et al., 2018). These properties are crucial for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The EIS spectra of CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS with dark and light irradiation is shown in Fig. 5b. The arc radius in the EIS spectra represents the charge separation and transport resistance at the surface of the electrode. The arc radius of 0.4CQD/CdS reduced under visible light irradiation, indicating the faster charge transport kinetics, which was in good agreement with the result of PL and photocurrent analysis. The data were fitted to an equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 5b) and reported all the fitting parameters in Table 1 . As shown in the circuit, the series resistance of the semiconductor/FTO interface, the surface state trapping resistance at the bulk of photoelectrode, and charge transfer across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface are represented by Rs, Rtrap and Rct, respectively. The Rct values were found to be 229 kΩ and 73 kΩ, respectively for CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS, indicating the higher electrical conductivity of CQD/CdS compared to bare CdS. At the same time, Rtrap values for CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS were found to be 9.4 kΩ and 6.8 kΩ, respectively, which implies a facilitated charge transfer CQD/CdS compare to bare CdS. The decrease in resistances signifies the increase in electrical conductivity due to the electron acceptor ability of CQD from CdS (Molaei, 2020). Furthermore, the increase in capacitance (Ctrap) indicates better charge storage properties of CQD on the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces (Mohanta et al., 2019). Additionally, the TRPL spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 475 nm (Fig. S5). The TRPL decay for 0.4CQD/CdS was 1.46 ns, which is lower than that for CdS (2.26 ns) (Liu et al., 2018). The lower lifetime indicates an efficient charge transfer from the semiconductor to the cocatalyst surface and suppression of the electron-hole recombination (Gogoi et al., 2018; Wolff et al., 2018) The decreased PL lifetime clearly indicates the faster electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of CdS to CQD, effectively inhibiting electron-hole recombination (Li and Zhu, 2018; Sun et al., 2015). The flat band potential ( E fb ) and charge carrier density (ND) were calculated from Mott-Schottky (MS) measurements performed by EIS (Fig. 5c). The E fb was measured by extrapolating a line from the linear relationship of 1 C 2 versus E , where C is the space charge capacitance of the semiconductor electrode at 1000 Hz in the dark. The positive slopes of the MS plots indicate the n-type semiconductor. Apparently, the E fb of bare CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS were found to be −1.25 and −1.37 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (Weng and Chang, 2016) and −0.64 and −0.76 V (vs. NHE, from the Nernst equation), respectively (He et al., 2019). Generally, the bottom of the CB in n-type semiconductors is more negative by about 0.10 V than E fb (He et al., 2014). Therefore, the CBs of CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS were −0.74 and −0.86 V vs. NHE. These potentials are more negative than the redox potential of water (-0.41 V vs. NHE, pH = 7) (Maeda, 2013). The corresponding valence band (VB) potential of bare CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS were determined to be 1.61 and 1.44 V vs. NHE, respectively (VB = CB + Bandgap) (Fig. 5d) (Ai et al., 2019). The charge carrier densities were calculated from the slope of MS plot, which was 2.7 × 1020 and 3.6 × 1020 cm−3 for bare CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS, respectively (Table 1) (Mohanta et al., 2019). The increased carrier density leads to the increase of band bending by shifting the Fermi level, thus facilitating the faster transfer of photo-excited electrons from CdS to CQD under irradiation in the CQD/CdS heterostructures (Hou et al., 2015)."
10,Photocatalyst testing for water splitting,"3.2 Photocatalyst testing for water splitting No appreciable H2 production was noticed in the absence of photocatalyst and/or the light irradiation in both presence and absence of SR. All the photocatalytic water splitting experiments for H2 evolution were carried out in the presence of 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3 SRs (unless otherwise mentioned) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Effect of photocatalyst loading: Fig. 6 a shows the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate with different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 mg L−1) of CdS photocatalyst. The rate of H2 production was first increased with photocatalyst loading upto 1 mg L−1 and then decreased. Photocatalyst concentration of 1 mg L−1 exhibited the highest H2 production rate of 198 mmol h−1 g−1. At higher photocatalyst concentrations, the solution became turbid and thus blocked light irradiation (Yunus et al., 2017). The turbidity in the presence of 1 mg L−1 CdS was found to be 0.9 NTU which is much lower as compared to that with 10 mg L−1 (366 NTU). The agglomeration of photocatalyst may also affect the light absorption. Therefore, 1 mg L−1 photocatalyst was found to be optimal for further water splitting experiments. Effect of loading of CQD onto CdS: The H2 production rate using bare CdS and the 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 1 wt% CQD/CdS is shown in Fig. 6b. The rate was increased with wt% of CQD and reached a maximum at 0.4 wt% loading of CQD. The excessive CQD loading would occupy the active sites on the surface of CdS, hindering the light absorption. The H2 production rate was found to be 309 mmol h−1 g−1 over 0.4CQD/CdS (a typical GC chromatogram is shown in Fig. S6), which was 1.5 times higher as compared to that over CdS (198 mmol h−1 g−1). An apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 32.6% was obtained over 0.4CQD/CdS at 420 nm wavelength. There was no contribution of field effect and multiple excitations for production H2 because a black box was used to conduct the water-splitting experiments. Due to its delocalized conjugated structure, the CQD transfers the photogenerated electrons at a faster rate, resulting in an efficient electron-hole pair separation. The effective charge separation/transport (as confirmed by EIS, PL, and XPS spectra) are the major reasons for the better photocatalytic performance of CQD/CdS (Di et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2018). The comparison of H2 production rate data with that reported in the literature (Table S4) indicates at least one order of magnitude higher production rate in our study. The Pt deposited on CdS semiconductor exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate of 10 to 50 mmol h−1 g−1 (Jia et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015). The Bi-CQDs/CdS showed a H2 production rate of around 2 mmol h−1 g−1 through the interfacial charge separation (Wang et al., 2019). Zhu et al. achieved 5 mmol h−1 g−1 of H2 production from seawater using electrolytically prepared CDs on CdS (Zhu et al., 2019). As compared to above-mentioned studies, the H2 evolution rate (198 mmol h−1 g−1 with CdS NWs and 309 mmol h−1 g−1 with CQD/CdS) in the present work was remarkably high. This could be attributed to the existence of sulfur vacancies and the formation of cadmium oxide species, as confirmed from the XPS and FTIR analysis. The cadmium oxide present may form a heterojunction with CdS and results in the effective charge transfer and separation. This enhanced rate can be attributed to several factors: (i) the right amount of photocatalyst used, (ii) the right quantity of biomass-derived CQD used in the CQD/CdS catalyst, (iii) the SRs used and (iv) the formation of CdO heterojunction in between CQD and CdS. These four factors synergistically contributed to a higher H2 production rate. Testing the photocatalysts in the absence of SRs provides important information about the photo-corrosion of CdS in the presence and absence of CQD. The production rate of H2 over bare CdS and 0.4CQD/CdS under visible light irradiation without and with SRs is compared in Fig. 6c. The stoichiometric H2 and O2 yields (0.23 and 0.1 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively) were obtained using 0.4CQD/CdS. Whereas, using bare CdS, H2 was not produced in the absence of SRs. This indicates that the presence of CQD enhances the photocatalytic activity by providing reduction/oxidation active sites (Zhu et al., 2017). The stoichiometric production of H2 and O2 also indicates that the holes generated during the photo-irradiation are effectively used for the oxidation of water to produce oxygen but not for the oxidation of S2− ions in CdS. Therefore, the CQD present in the CdS restrains its photocorrosion. The recombination of charges is evidently lower with CQD/CdS as compared to that with bare CdS, which is why the H2 production is realized with CQD/CdS but not with CdS in the absence of SRs. This is in-line with the photocatalyst testing data in presence of SRs and the characterization data. It is worth noting that the photo-generated charges are not completely separated in the absence of SRs. This is evident when the H2 production data in presence of SRs (309 mmol h−1 g−1) is compared with that in the absence of SRs (0.23 mmol h−1 g−1) over 0.4CQD/CdS (Fig. 6c). The enhancement of the H2 production rate was because of the more effective scavenging of photo-generated holes by the SRs (Wang et al., 2013) as compared to that by water oxidation. Reusability and stability of photocatalyst: To investigate the stability of the photocatalyst, the solution was purged with N2 for 30 min after completion of each photocatalytic reaction experiment and were repeated for three cycles (Fig. 6d). The stability of 0.4CQD/CdS was higher as compared to that of bare CdS suggesting that the introduction of CQD onto the surface of CdS partly restrained the photo-corrosion of CdS. The CdS photocorrosion is mainly attributed to the oxidation of sulfide ions by photogenerated holes and/or radicals (reaction (1)). Tang et al. showed the inhibition of CdS photocorrossion by coating with amorphous carbon and tested for photodegradation (Tang et al., 2014). Liu et al. (2013) also reported the stabilization of CdS in the presence of CQD, resulting in higher photocatalytic activity (Liu et al., 2013). In the present work, CQD, on CdS surface, traps the electrons from the CB of CdS and protects CdS through hindering the attack of active species, especially OH radicals, on intermediate species S− to S2−. Thus, the faster movement of charge carriers (as depicted from the EIS analysis) in the CQD/CdS helps to suppress the self-oxidation of CdS by holes generated upon irradiation (Zhu et al., 2017). Moreover, the photogenerated holes were quenched by SR which prevents the photo-corrosion of CQD/CdS. Overall, the 0.4CQD/CdS photocatalysts demonstrated a good anti-photocorrosion property. (2) CdS + 2hVB + → Cd2+ + S Discussion and mechanism of enhancement of H2 production rate: A possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activity and charge transport phenomena of the CQD/CdS was proposed based on the above results and the literature reports (Fig. 7 ). Generally, the CdS semiconductor has a favorable band gap to absorb visible light (λ > 420 nm) and its conduction and valance bands favor H2 and O2 evolution reactions, respectively. With these two parameters in favor, one may expect that the H2 production is possible over CdS with visible light irradiation. However, the recombination rate of the photogenerated charges and the photo-corrosion are higher with CdS. These unfavorable conditions result in either lower or no H2 production. That is what we observed in this study: lower and no hydrogen production with and without SRs, respectively. The positions of conduction (CB) and valance bands (VB) of CdS lie at more negative and less positive potentials, respectively than those of CdO. In CdS/CdO heterostructure, the photoexcited electrons can transfer from CB of CdS to the CB of CdO and holes can migrate from VB of CdO to the VB of CdS. Thus, the recombination of charges is inhibited (Cho and Sung, 2017; Kahane et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2020). The formation of CdS/CdO heterostructure was evident from the XPS and FTIR analysis. Therefore, the better water splitting performance of CdS NWs in the present study as compared to that reported in the literature could be attributed to the presence of CdS/CdO heterostructures. Recently, CdS/CdOx photocatalyst was studied and achieved a higher rate of H2 evolution from the reforming of lignocellulose (Wakerley et al., 2017). Li et al. reported 2.6 times higher photoactivity with CdO/CdS than that with bare CdO due to the suppression of the recombination of charges (Li et al., 2013). Kahane et al. also reported a higher hydrogen production rate with CdS/CdO as compared to those of CdS and CdO (Kahane et al., 2013). On the other hand, in CQD/CdS, the stronger interaction between CQD and CdS and creating heterojunction of CdO with CdS, as evidenced by the XPS and FTIR and a faster charge transfer rate as depicted from the EIS Nyquist plot and PL spectra, effectively reduce the recombination of charge carriers (Zhu et al., 2017). This is because of the delocalized ᴨ-conjugated structure of CQD, which has superior electron-conducting properties (Qu et al., 2018). Besides, the 0.4CQD/CdS showed a higher separation efficiency (PL analysis), which plays a vital role in photocatalytic water splitting (Liu et al., 2013). The MS plot (Fig. 5c) demonstrated the shifting of CB potential of CQD/CdS towards more negative potential (from −0.74 to −0.86 V vs. NHE) upon the induction of CQD onto CdS. At the same time, the VB potentials were located below the oxidation potential of H2O to O2. Due to these favorable conditions, the hydrogen production rate is higher with CQD/CdS as compared to that with bare CdS. Therefore, the photoexcited electrons transfer from CB of CdS to CB of CdO and then to the surface of CQD, where reduction of water takes place. In addition, CQD/CdS produce H2 without any SRs under visible light at a stoichiometric ratio (H2:O2 ≈ 2:1) and the bare CdS did not produce any H2 (Fig. 6c). This indicates that the CQD suppresses the photo-corrosion of CdS and promotes O2 production by reducing the reaction between holes and S2− (CdS) to stabilize the catalysts. Thus, the significant enhancement of H2 rate and the stability of CQD/CdS semiconductor could mainly be due to the inhibition of both recombination of charges and the photo-corrosion of CdS. The SRs further help in scavenging the holes from the valance band of CdS and enhance the H2 production rate. The reaction mechanism of water splitting on photocatalyst using Na2S/Na2SO3 as SR can be described by reactions (3)–(6), (8). (3) P h o t o c a t a l y s t + h υ → P h o t o c a t a l y s t ( h V B + + e C B - ) (4) 2 H 2 O + 2 e C B - → H 2 + 2 O H - (5) 2 S 2 - + 2 h V B + → S 2 2 - (6) S 2 2 - + S O 3 2 - → S 2 O 3 2 - + S 2 - (7) S O 3 2 - + S 2 - + 2 h V B + → S 2 O 3 2 - (8) S 2 O 3 2 - + 4 h V B + + 6 O H - → 2 S O 3 2 - + 3 H 2 O S 2 - + 6 h V B + + 6 O H - → S O 3 2 - + 3 H 2 O ( o v e r a l l r e a c t i o n o f 5 , 6 a n d 8 ) (9) S O 3 2 - + 2 h V B + + 2 O H - → S O 4 2 - + H 2 O When the CdS semiconductor is irradiated with the visible light possessing energy more than the bandgap of CdS (2.35 eV), the electrons in the VB are excited to CB, creating holes in the VB (reaction (3)). The photoexcited electrons then move to the surface of the CdS where they undergo reactions with the adsorbed water molecules resulting in the formation of H2 (reaction (4)). At the same time, the photo-generated holes react with SRs such as Na2S and Na2SO3 and form yellow polysulfide ions such as S 2 2 - . The S O 3 2 - ions react with S 2 2 - and convert them back to S 2 - (reaction (6)). Thus the colorless state is maintained and prevents the sulfur deposition on CdS (Wang et al., 2017). The S 2 O 3 2 - ions oxidize back to S O 3 2 - by the reaction with 6 O H - ions and 4 holes (reaction (8)), particularly in the presence of carbon (CQD) (Zhu et al., 2017). In the overall reaction of reactions (5), (6) and (8), the concentration of S O 3 2 - ions increase and that of S 2 - ions decrease. The overall reaction consumes six holes indicating that three moles of H2 is produced for each mole of S 2 - ions consumed. The thiosulfate S 2 O 3 2 - ions oxidation (reaction (8)) is crucial for an effective overall reaction and for scavenging of holes. The biomass derived CQDs were attached with O H - groups (Fig. 3d & Fig. S2d) on the surface and/or edge, which positively influence the reaction (8). The S O 3 2 - ion undergoes complete oxidation to S O 4 2 - ions (reaction (9)), if the VB potential is more positive. However, MS plot (Fig. 5c) suggests that the VB potential of CQD/CdS is less positive than that of bare CdS. This indicates that the side-product formation from SRs with CQD/CdS is less possible. The oxidized products may get reduced by competing with hydrogen production. Since no reduction in the H2 production activity was observed, we can safely conclude that either reaction (9) is slower or the reduction of sulfate ions is not favorable."
11,Conclusions,"The carbon quantum dots material was synthesized from orange peels and embedded it into the 1-D CdS nanowires. The XRD and XPS revealed the strong interaction between CQD and CdS through the formation of cadmium oxide in the interface. The synthesized CQD/CdS was tested for the photocatalytic H2 production under visible light illumination. The 0.4CQD/CdS showed excellent photocatalytic, as well as photoelectrochemical performance, compared to that of bare CdS. A higher transient photocurrent density was observed over CQD/CdS (48 µA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) as compared to that over bare CdS (24 µA cm−2), indicating an efficient charge carrier separation over CQD/CdS. The highest H2 production rate of 309 mmol h−1 g−1 (AQY 32.6% at 420 nm) was obtained in the presence of sacrificial reagents (Na2S/Na2SO3) over CQD/CdS under visible light irradiation. The enhancement of the H2 production rate is mainly attributed to the optimum conditions used along with the outstanding charge separation/transfer properties through the cadmium oxide of CQD/CdS and the suppression of recombination of charges. The photostability of CdS was improved significantly upon the incorporation of CQD."
