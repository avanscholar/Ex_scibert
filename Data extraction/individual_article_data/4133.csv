0,Introduction,"Energy crisis and increasing environmental pollution are two of the greatest threats to human population sustainability at a global scale. Within this wide contest, wastewater previously considered as a waste is increasingly being used as a valuable resource for producing fresh water, energy and fertilizing nutrients (N and P). For instance, the wastewater's organic content can be converted into methane gas through the anaerobic process [1], and microbial fuel cell (MFC) [2,3] may also be a viable route for the production of energy from wastewater treatment. Photocatalytic oxidation using titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an effective method for the removal of chemically stable contaminants, it requires no chemicals input or output and TiO2 is inexpensive and non-toxic [4–8]. The photocatalytic oxidation of contaminants is initiated by the excitation of TiO2, which results in the promotion of an electron (e−) to the conduction band (CB) and creation of a hole (h+) in the valence band (VB) of TiO2 [9]. The photogenerated electrons and holes produce highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e. H2O2, HO·, O2·−) which can attack and oxidize organic contaminants [10], ultimately leading to complete mineralization. The utilization of freely available solar energy as the only energy input makes photocatalysis a sustainable and green process. However, one of the most important advancement in wastewater treatment should be the development of a new process that can simultaneously capture the chemical energy of the oxidized contaminants while meeting the effluent quality standards [1]. Although the appeal of the direct conversion of solar into chemical energy during a wastewater treatment process has been recognized for a long time, effective efforts are still rare. Recently, a series of studies have succeeded in using some organic fractions in wastewater (i.e. phenolic compounds and dyes) to act as electron donors for producing H2 [11,12] and for electricity generation [13], and our group has reported the feasibility of hydrogen generation during the removal of emerging contaminants [14,15]. Very few studies have focused on the harvesting of energy during the removal of both organic and inorganic compounds (e.g. nutrients) in contaminated water and wastewater, making this the main scientific and technological challenge for the water industry. In this study, inspired by the PhotoFuelCell system proposed by Lianos and coworkers [16–19], we demonstrate that dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DSPCs) may be valuable to address this technological issue. The concept of DSPCs is similar with that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In a DSSC, the sensitizer, which is usually a dye, absorbs the incident photons resulting in the excitation of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye. The excited electrons are then injected to the conduction band (CB) of the photoanode material (usually TiO2), they further transfer to the photoanode fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) supporting the TiO2 and through the external load, travel to the cathode FTO and to the cathode material (usually a Pt layer). They then transfer to the HOMO of the redox couples (usually I−/I3 −), and finally back to the HOMO of the dye [20,21] to close the cycle. In this process, the redox couples play a very important role as electrons bridges for the stabilization of charges in the DSSCs. One major innovating aspect of the present study is the replacement of the redox couples (such as I−/I3 −) in DSSCs with organic and inorganic compounds naturally occurring in urban wastewater, which collectively can act as an effective electrolyte and also reduced the dye from an excited state to a stable state. Although dyes have been reported to be unstable in water, they may have a temporary sensitization effect. Under an ideal situation, organic contaminants may be oxidized by an excited dye in the photoanode, while nitrate and heavy metal could be reduced in the cathode (Fig. 1 ) including the reduction of protons to H2. In this study, the DSPC with Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers as the photoanode material, a platinized FTO sheet as the counter electrode and actual urban wastewater as the electrolyte was investigated for the first time for the simultaneous generation of electricity, hydrogen gas and for the simultaneous removal of contaminants from wastewater, including 17-β-ethynylestradiol (EE2) as a representative of chemically stable and emerging contaminants, which was added to the wastewater. The performance and the underlying mechanisms of this highly innovating concept for environmental remediation with simultaneous generation of renewable energy are presented in this study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers photoanode,"2.1 Synthesis of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers photoanode Chiral TiO2 nanofibers were synthesized with N-(1-oxooctadecyl)-d-glutamic acid (C18-D-Glu) as template and details can be found in our previous study [22]. In a typical synthesis, C18-D-Glu (0.06g, 0.16mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (27.2g) and deionized water (160ml) while stirring at room temperature. After the mixture was stirred for 10min, titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (0.58g, 75% in isopropanol, purchased from TCI) was added to the mixture with stirring at 55°C. The mixture was allowed to react at 55°C with stirring for 2h. The products were collected by centrifugal separation and dried by freeze drying at −60°C, which resulted in a pale yellow powder. All organics in this product were removed by calcination at 550°C, and crystalline anatase was obtained. Then, the as-prepared pure chiral TiO2 nanofibers were used to fabricate Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers. In a typical synthesis of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers, pure chiral TiO2 nanofibers (0.2g) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (0.3g, purchased from TCI) were added into deionized water (100mL) while stirring at room temperature. After the mixture was stirred for 60min, AgNO3 (2.0mL, 0.1M) was quickly added into the mixture. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for further 60min and irradiated with an 8W UVC light for 40min. The suspension was collected by centrifugal separation and then dried at 80°C for 8h, which resulted in a brown powder. Finally, the powder was calcined at 300°C in air and Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers were obtained. Chiral TiO2 nanofibers were also physically broken with the application of pressure at 10MPa using FTIR tablet press (to avoid changes of the TiO2 morphological structures) prior to the deposition of Ag/AgCl, to prepare Ag/AgCl @ broken chiral TiO2 nanofibers. The synthesis of Ag/AgCl @ broken chiral TiO2 nanofibers was carried out under the same conditions used to prepare the Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers, to ensure that an equal amount of Ag/AgCl was deposited on the same amount of chiral TiO2 nanofibers and broken chiral nanofibers."
3,Assembly of DSPCs,"2.2 Assembly of DSPCs The Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers photoanode was prepared by adding 6g of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (MW 22,000, purchased from TCI) into 14mL of boiled distilled water with powerful stirring, producing a highly viscous liquid that was further diluted by adding to a solvent made of 18mL distilled water and 25mL ethanol at 70°C. Then, 1.62g of the as-prepared Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers were added into the PVA/water/ethanol solution to produce a suspension which was left to cool to room temperature. The photoanode films were produced on FTO glass (2.3mm thickness, 25cm2 area, 8Ω/sq, Dyesol Glass, previously cleaned with 2-propanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30min, and then thoroughly rinsed with distilled water, followed by drying on nitrogen) by coating a paste of the suspension using the doctor-blade technique [23]. After coating the films were kept in a clean box for 15min to relax surface irregularities and the residual mechanical stress of the coating. Finally, the photoanode was gradually heated at 80°C for 15min and then at 500°C for 30min. The thickness of the film (11μm) was increased by repeating this doctor-blade technique [24]. For the preparation of the counter electrode, a drop of 5mM H2PtCl6·H2O in 2-propanol was placed on the FTO glass substrate (25cm2 area), following by drying and annealing at 450°C for 30min. The photoanode was impregnated with the dye by immersion into a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile (CR, Sigma–Aldrich) and tert-butanol (CR, Sigma–Aldrich) containing a 0.5mM N719 (Dyesol) dye solution for 6h. Then, the dye-loaded photoanode was washed with acetonitrile and dried with nitrogen. The DSPCs were assembled into a sandwich design using the dye loaded photoanode and the cathode. The distance between the two electrodes was 5mm. The gap between the electrodes was filled with actual wastewater collected from the effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Suzhou (China) with further addition (0.56mg/L) of 17-β-ethynylestradiol (EE2) (HPLC grade, Merck) and CuSO4 (1.03mg/L). The chemical properties of the wastewater effluent are presented in Table S1 (Supplementary Material). The pH of the wastewater in the DSPCs was adjusted using 1mol/L H2SO4."
4,Instruments and experimental conditions,"2.3 Instruments and experimental conditions Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JSM-7041F at an accelerating voltage of 1kV. Large scope EDX analysis was conducted on an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (ZAF Quantification) attached to the SEM of JEOL JSM-7041F. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL 2011 operation at 200kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer D/MAX-2200/PC equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40kV, 20mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were obtained with PHI 5000C ESCA with Mg Kα source operating at 14kV and 25mA. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed in triplicate on similar samples to ensure reproducibility, on a SHIMADZU UV-2450 with a collection speed of 40nmmin−1 and BaSO4 as the reference. All samples were obtained by scratching films off the FTO substrates and degassing at 200°C overnight. Prior to irradiation, 12 fabricated DSPC cells (the volume of each cell was 12.5mL) were fixed vertically into an oscillation box, and were simultaneously shaken in the dark, for 40min, to establish adsorption–desorption equilibrium of the solution species with the electrodes. Then water samples for analysis were taken when all 12 cells were irradiated for two hours using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Oriel) equipped with a 150W xenon light and AM 1.5G type filter (Newport, 81094). It should be noted that samples for analyses were collected at 10-min interval sequentially from ordered DSPCs (e.g. sample #1 was collected from cell #1 at t =0, sample #2 was collected from cell #2 at t =10min, etc.) since the liquid volume in each cell was small and repeated sampling only from one cell would have interfered with the cell performance. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the 12 cells were measured as described elsewhere [24]. The amount of hydrogen, the concentrations of EE2, TOC, TN and DO were measured as shown in our previous studies [4,14,25]. Briefly, the concentration of EE2 was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1100). TOC was measured by means of a Shimadzu TOC-VVPN with an ANSI-V auto sampler. TN was measured using multi N/C 2100 TOC analyzer (Analytikjena, Germany). DO was monitored with electrode for DO sensor (UC-12-SOL, Central Kagaku Co.). The gas produced was collected by the water displacement method using a solution containing sulfuric acid (2%) and NaCl (10%) and then measured using a gas chromatograph (HP Agilent, 6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve 5A column."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers,"3.1 Characterization of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers SEM pictures of the Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers (Fig. 2a) revealed that the left-handed, double-helical morphology was preserved after the deposition of the Ag and AgCl nanoparticles. The average length of undamaged TiO2 nanofibers was ∼500nm and diameter was ∼20nm. TEM analyses (Fig. 2b–c) revealed that Ag/AgCl nanoparticles with the average diameters of 5–8nm were deposited on the surface of the chiral TiO2 nanofibers, preferentially at the outer edges of the TiO2 crystals of the helical structure, following the conceptual structure shown in Fig. 2d. The elemental and chemical compositions of the samples were further determined by XPS. The results (Fig. S1a, Supplementary Material) suggest that Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers contain Ti, O, C, Ag and Cl elements. The C1s was attributed to the adventitious hydrocarbon released from the XPS instrument [23]. In Fig. S1b (Supplementary Material), the Ag 3d spectra consists of two individual peaks approximately at 373 and 367eV, which are due to Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 binding energy, respectively. The existence of Ag0 and Ag+1 could be verified by further peaks divisions [24]. Consequently, the XPS analyses suggested that the nanoparticles deposited on chiral TiO2 nanofibers were made of Ag/AgCl composites. The elemental composition determined by EDX (Fig. S2, Supplementary Material), resulted in a Ag content of 5.49mol % and a Cl content of 2.86mol %, which indicated that the Ag/AgCl was virtually at a 1:1 molar ratio. XRD results also suggested the co-existence of Ag and AgCl (Fig. S3 and detailed descriptions in Supplementary Material). Further details on material characterization have been reported [22]. Moreover, the chiral nanostructure was preserved after the doctor-blade process although some aggregation of the nanofibers was observed (Fig. 3 )."
7,Contaminants removal in the DSPC,"3.2 Contaminants removal in the DSPC EE2 representing for chemically stable organic compounds and Cu2+ representing for heavy metal ions were spiked into the wastewater at specific concentrations to investigate the removal of contaminants (TOC, TN, EE2 and Cu2+) in the cell (Fig. 4 ). TOC, Cu2+ and EE2 were totally removed after 80min, while only approximately 70% of TN was removed within 120min. Simultaneously, a decrease of DO over time was observed, suggesting that the mineralization of TOC and EE2 was aerobic [15]. The fast photodegradation of the TOC including EE2 should be attributed to the combined effect of (i) the strong photocatalytic activity of irradiated Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers and of (ii) the oxidization ability of sensitized dyes. Regarding the first effect, Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers under visible-light irradiation produces photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the Ag nanoparticles due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [26]. In this process, SPR generates the electron–hole pairs in the semiconductor (AgCl and TiO2) by the dipole–dipole interaction between the donor (Ag) and the acceptors (AgCl and TiO2). The photocatalytic activity of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers should mainly be attributed to two simultaneous processes. The first process involves the strong electronic coupling between Ag and AgCl conduction bands, which injects photoinduced electrons from the Ag nanoparticles, quickly and efficiently, into the AgCl [27] and into the TiO2 helical structure, probably yielding superoxide radicals and finally HO· radicals from the reductive pathway, as reported with other dyes [28]. However, this effect should not be significant for the removal of the contaminants since the direct charge transfer from the noble nanoparticles, or the internal photoemission from TiO2 and AgCl [29], only plays a supporting role in the photoelectrical performance. This was verified of the J–V characteristics of the solar cells not sensitized without dye N719 (see Fig. S5, Supplementary Material). Regarding the effect of the sensitized dye on the removal of TOC and EE2, the redox potential of N719/sensitized N719 is ∼1.1V (vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) [21] and sensitized N719/oxidized N719 is ∼−0.6V (vs. NHE) [30] which is sufficient to oxidize most organic compounds in wastewater, since their redox potentials were mostly less than 0.6V vs. NHE [31]. As a result, the reduction of the sensitized dye to its ground state maintained the cell cycle until all organic contaminants were removed from the wastewater. Since the pH of the wastewater in the cell was slightly acidic, the decrease in the TN should be attributed to the reduction of NO3 − of the wastewater by the electrons transferred to the photocathode: (1) 2 N O 3 − + 10 H + + 8 e − → N 2 O + 5 H 2 O E 0 = 0.7989 V (2) N O 3 − + 4 H + + 3 e − → NO + 2 H 2 O E 0 = 0.9637 V This significant mass deficit in the TN balance also confirms that some gaseous product such as NO and N2O were generated as a result of NO3 − reduction. The residual 30% of TN remaining after the photoelectrical degradation of contaminants was completed should be in the form of NH3-N as it could not be reduced in either acidic or neutral conditions [32]."
8,Photoelectrical performance and hydrogen generation of the DSPC,"3.3 Photoelectrical performance and hydrogen generation of the DSPC SPR is characterized by a build-up of intense, spatially non-homogeneous oscillating electric fields in the neighborhood of the nanostructure [22]. The SPR effect at the photoanode improves the efficiency of the DSPCs by (1) increasing light absorption due to surface plasmons and light-trapping effects, (2) facilitating the charge separation as a result of the localized electro-magnetic field, (3) promoting the electron transfer to the adsorbed species, and (4) as a result of the electron storage effect that can shifts the Fermi level to more negative potentials [33–36]. Although the direct charge transfer from Ag nanoparticles to the semiconductor may also prove useful for the generation of electricity as mentioned above, the main mechanism of photo-excitation of the photoanode with visible light implies the sensitization of the N719 dye, and the transfer of excited electrons to the Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers, the external load, the counter cathode and lastly the simultaneous reductions of NO3 −, H+ and Cu2+. The presence of metallic Cu on the surface of the counter electrode after the reduction process was further substantiated by two XPS peaks at 932.6eV and 952.5eV (Fig. S4, Supplementary Material). In parallel to the above mechanism, the sensitized N719 dye is reduced back to its ground state by the adsorbed organic matter and nitrogen, which were present in the wastewater, making sacrificial organic and inorganic matter essential to sustain the mechanism of the DSPCs. This mechanism is further exemplified by the current–voltage (J–V) and current–power densities (J–P) plots, which were recorded to investigate the electrical performance of the cell (Fig. 5 ). The short-circuit current densities (J sc ), open-circuit voltage (V oc ) and power densities varied with time during the irradiation of the DSPCs. J sc decreased significantly over time and it even turned to be 0.02mA/cm2 after 80min and then remained stable, while V oc decreased moderately (Table S2, Supplementary Material). These should be attributed to the removal of contaminants in the cell as they functioned as electrons bridges. Moreover, J sc is determined by electron injection [20,35] which depends on the concentration of contaminants, hence, J sc decreased eventually to a relatively low level as the contaminants were totally removed, after 80min. However, J sc did not decrease to 0 as expected, since Ag can also be excited by visible-light irradiation while TiO2 can be excited by the small fraction of UV accessible under AM 1.5 irradiation, which produced electron–hole pairs [33]. Then the produced electrons transferred through the external load to the cathode while the holes may react with H2O. This is consistent with the photoelectrical performance of the solar cells not sensitized with N719 (Fig. S5, Supplementary Material). In addition, these produced holes may also oxidize some N719 molecules and disable the DSPC (this will be discussed in following section). In contrast, V oc is largely affected by the properties of the photoanode, i.e., the conductive band potential of the photoanode and the dye absorption number [36], thus V oc decreased. The characterization of the cell under dark conditions is shown in Fig. S6 (Supplementary Material). The dark currents observed due to the presence of CuSO4 (J sc of 0.016mA/cm2) were insignificant in comparison with the currents observed under irradiation (Fig. 5). Cu2+ is practically removed from the aqueous solution in 40min (Fig. 4) to which corresponds a J sc of 4.59mA/cm2. The fill factors (Table S2, Supplementary Material) were calculated according to [16,37]: (3) f f = P max J s c V o c where P max is the maximum power density. Fig. 6 shows the photogeneration of H2 over time in the DSPCs. The electrons transferred to the counter electrode reduced protons to H2, although some H2 could also be formed during the degradation of organic matter [11,38]. The accumulation of H2 was not observed until 40min ca., when DO and Cu2+ were almost totally consumed (Fig. 4) as the redox potentials of Cu2+/Cu (0.3394V vs. NHE) and the redox potentials of O2/H2O (1.229V vs. NHE) were higher than that of H+/H2 (0 vs. NHE) [39]. In agreement with the electrical performance, the rate of H2 production gradually decreased as the concentration of contaminants decreased and reached approximately zero, after 80min, when the electricity was only generated due to the excitation of TiO2 and Ag under irradiation. The photo-electricity conversion efficiency (PCE) was calculated (Table S2, Supplementary Material) to evaluate the photoelectrical performance of the DSPC. An efficiency of 3.09% was recorded at 0min, indicating 3.09% of the incident light energy was converted into electricity. Moreover, the electricity–hydrogen conversion efficiency (ECE) was calculated: (4) E C E ( % ) = E H 2 E el = 2 n t U ∫ P max A d t × 100 where E H 2 is the H2 energy (J) produced by the cell, E el is the generated electrical energy on the photoanode (J), P max is the maximum power density (W/cm2), A is the irradiated surface area of photoanode (cm2), n is the total amount of hydrogen produced (mol), U is the hydrogen energy content (122kJ/g) and t is time (s). As shown in Table S2, 78.1% of the electricity generated from 40 to 50min was converted to hydrogen energy. While after 60min, approximately 98% of the electricity was converted due to the total removal of NO3 − in the wastewater."
9,Chirality and plasmonic effect in the DSPC,"3.4 Chirality and plasmonic effect in the DSPC The highest PCE in this study was 3.09% which is relatively high considering that the electrolyte was actual wastewater rather than I−/I3 − solution. This supports the superior performance of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers as photoanode in the DSPC. Herein, the photoanodes prepared with chiral TiO2 nanofibers, Ag/AgCl @ broken chiral TiO2 nanofibers served as controls, to exemplify the chiral plasmonic effect on the performance of the DSPC. The SEM and TEM pictures of these reference photoanode are shown in Fig. S7 (Supplementary Material). The absorption spectrums of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers thin film and other reference photoanode thin films are shown in Fig. S8 (Supplementary Material). The stronger absorption of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers at 200–350nm compared to pure chiral TiO2 nanofibers can be attributed to the characteristic absorption of the AgCl semiconductor [40], besides, Ag NPs can absorb photons from an area much larger than their geometric cross section. Resonance energy transfer (RET), the transfer of energy from a plasmon to a nearby semiconductor, enhances the intensity of the electric field thereby increasing optical absorption [41]. In contrast, the increased response in the visible-light region (400–800nm) results from the creation of SPR [42]. The significant red shift of the absorption edge observed in the Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers (trace c) when compared with Ag/AgCl @ broken chiral TiO2 nanofibers (trace b), demonstrates that controlled chirality at the nanoscale level combined with the periodic distribution of the plasmonic Ag/AgCl in the chiral TiO2 nanofiber, induces a greater SPR effect. The nanostructured ordered helical arrangement of the Ag/AgCl nanoparticles induces coupled plasmon waves propagating along the helical path, causing increased absorption of the incident light components that are in tune with the handedness of the helices. The collective plasmons that oscillate along the plasmonic chiral structure of certain handedness lead to different rate of light absorption in response to right- and left-circularly polarized light [42]. Therefore, the acceleration of SPR excitation results from the nanostructured architecture of ordered and periodically positioned Ag/AgCl nanoparticles (Fig. 2), which are irradiated at specific incident polarization angles. Thus, it could be concluded that the more intense SPR created by Ag nanoparticles of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers can cause a stronger local field enhancement around the Ag nanoparticles, which can increase light absorption of the surrounding dye molecules in a dye-loaded film (Fig. S8, Supplementary Material). The higher rate of light absorption by the dye can result in an enhancement of the rate of electron injection to the photoanode [43]. The production of energy of the DSPC with the Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers photoanode and with other reference photoanodes were also studied (Fig. S9, Supplementary Material) to exemplify the advantages associated with the use of a chiral plasmonic structure. The PCE values of the cell with Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers photoanode were higher than those of the reference cell with Ag/AgCl @ broken chiral TiO2 nanofibers, which should be partly attributed to the higher light harvesting efficiency of the unbroken nanofibers. Furthermore, in these materials Ag nanoparticles act as an effective ‘antenna’ for the incident visible light that stores the incident energy and create an intense electromagnetic field in the immediate vicinity [33], which in turn increases the rate of electron–hole formation in some localized regions of the semiconductor by a few orders of magnitude [43]. Concurrently, nanofibers owns faster electron transport, slower recombination rate [44,45] and can serve as light-scattering centers to increase the optical light extinction length in the film, thus also enhancing the light harvesting efficiency [24]. Hence, in the photoanode of this cell, chiral TiO2 nanofibers and Ag nanoparticles act in a symbiotic relationship that improves the electrical performance of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers film. Firstly, the SPR effect of Ag nanoparticles is accelerated by the chiral structure due to its capacity of tuning the angle of the incident light and the scattering of light. Secondly, the lifetime of the large amount of electrons generated is extended, owning to the faster electron transport and slower recombination rate in the chiral TiO2 nanofibers. Thirdly, the surface plasmons and light scattering (Ag also acts as a scattering center) can increase the intensity of the local field and light pathways, which enlarges the optical cross-section of dye sensitizer coated on the photoanode [46]. However, it was unexpected that only a slightly higher PCE of the cell with Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers was observed in comparison to the PCE of pure chiral TiO2 nanofibers (Fig. S9, Supplementary Material). We reason that this is due to the Ag nanoparticles acting as recombination centers, in essence creating internal short-circuits throughout the bulk of the photoactive layer [47]. Hence, the slight PCE improvement should be ascribed to the trade-off between the chiral plasmonic effect and the electron recombination role of Ag nanoparticles."
10,Cell stability and reuse,"3.5 Cell stability and reuse The stability and reuse of the DSPC was investigated to establish the effect of inactivation caused by the leaching of dye from the photoanode or by the deposition of by-products on the electrodes. Fig. 7 shows the absorbance of N719 dye deposited on the photoanode as a function of time t relative to the absorbance of a freshly prepared photoanode (i.e., A t /A 0) [48]. 45% of the dye was found to desorb after 24h immersion in wastewater, while only 20% of the dye remained after 120h. Therefore, with such long timescale the reduction of photoelectrical performance shown in Fig. 5 cannot be attributed to dye detachment alone. In general, water is believed to cause a loss of activity in the DSPCs [49,50]. For the particular case of N719 dye, since the redox potential of ROS/H2O (∼2.85V vs. NHE) [28] is higher than that of N719/sensitized N719 (∼1.0V vs. NHE) [33] it is conceivable that the leached dye could be oxidized by ROS after the total consumption of TOC from the wastewater. Such effect was demonstrated by examining the photoanode absorbance and photoelectrical performance of the cell with the wastewater sealed in the cell replaced by fresh wastewater every hour or every two hours (referred as 1h cell and 2h cell). The rate of leached dye (Fig. 7) for the 1h cell was as that with the photoanode immersed in wastewater since the TOC of the wastewater was never totally consumed. In contrast, the rate of leached dye for the 2h cell was much more rapid, implying that the N719 molecules were oxidized by the excited ROS after the total removal of TOC. Similarly, the photoelectrical performance of the 1h cell (Fig. 8 ) showed PCE values of the 1h cell decreasing by approximately 50% (mainly due to the lower J sc), and lower V oc after 24h, which can be ascribed to dye desorption [20]. However, the loss of photoelectrical performance was significantly higher for the 2h cell with a 90% decrease of the PCE after 12h, which should be attributed to the oxidization of N719 after the removal of TOC of the wastewater. Therefore, a more stable performance of the photoanodes can be anticipated if the cell was operated with a continuous flow of fresh wastewater. Further research efforts should be directed toward the production of more stable dyes for use in water-based DSPCs including the use of electrolyte additives (such as ionic surfactants) [51–55] and the use of hydrophobic dye sensitizers [49]."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, a DSPC with Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers as photoanode material, platinized conducting glass as cathode material and actual wastewater as the bridging electrolyte was proposed for simultaneous generation of electricity, hydrogen and contaminants removal. Excellent photoelectrical performance, fast hydrogen generation and contaminants removal were observed due to the symbiotic relationship between Ag nanoparticles and chiral nanofibers, which was exemplified by comparing the photoelectrical performance of Ag/AgCl @ chiral TiO2 nanofibers photoanode with that of Ag/AgCl @ broken chiral TiO2 nanofibers. This configuration opens up new opportunities for producing renewable energy from wastewater treatment processes including organic and inorganic matter as viable resources. Chiral nanofibers doped with SPR metal nanoparticles photoanode have great potential in boosting the performance of DSPC. Although the novel DSPC shown here is far from optimum performance, there are huge opportunities for further development. The introduction of a semiconductor insulator could hinder Ag from capturing electrons and the operation of the cell in continuous flow of wastewater may reduce dye leaching. With continued advances in DSPCs for water-based applications, it may therefore be possible to increase the efficiency of energy generation and contaminants removal and finally achieve its successful implementation in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment processes."
