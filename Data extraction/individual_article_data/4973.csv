0,Introduction,"The hydrogenation of nitriles is an important industrial process to produce primary amines that are valuable feedstock for obtaining many chemicals, pharmaceuticals and polymers [1]. The reaction is usually carried out over transition metal catalysts and forms secondary and tertiary amines as by-products. In order to obtain selectively primary amines, large amounts of ammonia have been often employed, which creates waste problems that make the process more difficult to implement on industrial scale [2]. Thus, there is a need for developing selective metal-supported catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions to efficiently hydrogenate nitriles to primary amines under mild operation conditions. The general mechanism of nitrile hydrogenation and coupling to higher amines used by many authors is based on the pioneer work of Braun et al. [3], Sabatier and Senderens [4], and others [5,6]. This mechanism is shown in Scheme 1 for butyronitrile (BN) hydrogenation to n-butylamine (BA) and coupling reactions leading to dibutylamine (DBA) and tributylamine (TBA) [7,8]. Butyronitrile conversion in Scheme 1 proceeds via butylimine, a highly reactive aldimine that has never been detected among the reaction products in BN hydrogenation [9]. Thus, several authors have considered the participation of other intermediates such as carbenes and nitrenes [1,10–13]. The selective formation of primary amines from nitrile hydrogenation on metals would occur via nitrile intermediates [12,14–16]. There is a general agreement that skeletal and supported Co and Ni catalysts are particularly suitable to yield primary amines [15,17–19]. The nitrile hydrogenation reaction has been mostly carried out in liquid phase using solvents, metal catalysts and batch reactors. Although the solvent nature may greatly influence the catalyst performance, very few papers on the impact of solvent on the catalyst activity and selectivity for nitrile hydrogenation have been published [1]. Rylander et al. [20] investigated the benzonitrile hydrogenation on Rh/C in ethanol, benzene and octane. Besson et al. [21] studied the hydrogenation of valeronitrile in different alcohols. In this work we investigate the liquid-phase BN hydrogenation on Co/SiO2 in methanol (protic solvent), cyclohexane (non-polar naphthenic solvent), and toluene and benzene (non-polar aromatic solvents). We selected the Co/SiO2 catalyst to carry out this study because in a previous paper we observed that cobalt was the most selective metal for obtaining n-butylamine from butyronitrile [19]. Optimal solvent selection needs a detailed knowledge on the relationship between the solvent nature and the gas–liquid–solid interactions taking place in slurry reactors. Precisely, we have discussed in recent works the influence that the interactions solvent–catalyst, solvent–reactant and reactant solvent–catalyst have on the activity and selectivity of metal-supported catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [22–24]."
1,Experimental section,"Co(9.8%)/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnating Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich 98%) on SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich G62, 300m2 g−1) by incipient-wetness impregnation at 303K. The impregnated sample was dried overnight at 373K, then heated in air to 673K and kept at this temperature for 2h. BET surface areas were measured by N2 physisorption in a Micromeritics Accusorb 2100E sorptometer. Elemental compositions were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Shimadzu XD-D1 diffractometer. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed in a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920, using 5% H2/Ar gaseous mixture. The solvent-catalyst interactions were studied by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of the solvent preadsorbed at 298K. Samples were reduced at 673K in H2(5%)/Ar, cooled down up to 298K and finally exposed to a solvent-saturated He stream for 60min. Then the weakly adsorbed solvent was removed by flushing with He at 298K for 1h. Temperature was then increased at 10K/min and the gaseous effluent was analyzed by mass spectrometry in a Baltzers Omnistar unit. Butyronitrile hydrogenation was studied at 13bar (H2) in a Parr 4843 reactor at 373K, as in our previous studies [13,19]. The autoclave was loaded with 150mL of solvent, 3mL of butyronitrile, 1.0g of catalyst, and 1mL of n-dodecane as internal standard. Toluene, methanol, benzene and cyclohexane were used as solvents. Prior to catalytic tests, samples were reduced in H2 at 673K and loaded immediately to the reactor under inert atmosphere. Product concentrations were analyzed by gas chromatography using an Agilent 6850 GC chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector, a temperature programmer and a 50m HP-1 capillary column. Selectivities (Sj , mol of product j/mol of butyronitrile reacted) were calculated as S j =CjνBN/(CBN 0 −CBN)νj where νBN and νj are the stoichiometric coefficients of butyronitrile and product j, respectively. Yields (ηj , mol of product j/mol of butyronitrile fed) were calculated as ηj = Sj XBN. We verified that the catalytic activity results obtained in this work were obtained under kinetically controlled regime. The quantitative criteria described by Ramachandran and Chaudhari [25] were used to analyze the significance of gas–liquid, liquid–solid and intraparticle mass transfer on the reaction kinetics."
2,Results,
3,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The SiO2 surface area (300m2/g) did not change significantly after the metal impregnation and the consecutive oxidation/reduction steps used for obtaining Co/SiO2 (290m2/g). The calcined sample was characterized by XRD and TPR techniques. Co3O4 (ASTM 9-418) was identified from the XRD pattern in Fig. 1A. The Co3O4 particle size determined using the Debye–Scherrer equation was 12nm. The TPR profile of Co/SiO2 (Fig. 1B) exhibited two reduction peaks at 573K and 623K, which reflect the consecutive reduction Co3+ →Co2+ →Co0 [26]. From these results, it is inferred that Co was totally in the metallic state after the standard reduction step used prior to catalytic tests (reduction in pure H2 at 673K)."
4,Catalyst activity and selectivity,"3.2 Catalyst activity and selectivity Fig. 2 presents the curves of BN conversion and yields as a function of time obtained for Co/SiO2 in methanol, benzene, toluene and cyclohexane. From the XBN vs time curves of Fig. 2 we determined the initial BN conversion rates per g of catalyst (r BN 0, mmol/h gcat) that are presented in Table 1 . Data of selectivities (Si) and XBN at the end of the runs are also presented in Table 1. In all the solvents, XBN increased continuously on Co/SiO2 with the progress of the reaction, reaching 100% at the end of the runs. The r BN 0 values obtained in different solvents followed the order cyclohexane>toluene>methanol>benzene. Regarding catalyst selectivity, Co/SiO2 in toluene formed initially BA and BBA. According to the von Braun's mechanism [3], DBA is produced by hydrogenation of BBA which in turns would be formed by interaction between butylimine and BA. Consistently, Fig. 2 shows that BBA in toluene was formed at the beginning of the reaction and then went through a maximum as it was consecutively converted to DBA. The local slopes of the ηi curves in Fig. 2 give the rate of formation of each product at a specific BN conversion and reaction time. The initial slope of DBA formation curve in toluene was zero, thereby confirming that DBA is a secondary product. At the end of reaction, Co/SiO2 in toluene yielded a mixture of BA (70%) and DBA (29%), being the carbon balance 99% (Table 1). The Co/SiO2 selectivity changed when toluene was replaced by other solvents. If we consider a methanol→benzene→toluene→cyclohexane sequence, data in Table 1 show that the selectivity to DBA increased at the expenses of BA formation. Additional catalytic runs were performed on Co/SiO2 in toluene to determine the reaction order in hydrogen. The reaction orders were obtained from Eq. (1) that represents the BN conversion rate: (1) r B N 0 = k P H 2 a C B N 0 b . The dependence of r BN 0 upon P H 2 was studied at 373K by varying P H 2 between 5 and 25bar at C BN 0 =0.22mol/L. From the logarithmic plot of r BN 0 as a function of P H 2 (not shown here) we determined that reaction order a was about one. From this result, it could be expected that the catalyst hydrogenation activity will be higher in solvents providing the highest H2 solubility. However, we do not observe here a direct correlation between catalyst activity and H2 solubility. In fact, data in Table 2 show that the highest H2 solubility occurs in methanol, in which we obtained the lowest initial BN conversion rate. Then, it is clear that other solvent effects such as solvent–catalyst and solvent–reactant interactions have to be taken into account in order to interpret the observed changes in Co/SiO2 activity and selectivity."
5,Solvent–catalyst interactions,"3.3 Solvent–catalyst interactions In order to obtain insight on the solvent–catalyst interaction strength, we investigated the temperature-programmed desorption of the solvents on Co/SiO2 by analyzing the evolved products by mass spectrometry. Fig. 3 presents the solvent TPD profiles obtained on Co/SiO2. The TPD of cyclohexane shows the evolution of m/z =56 signal (the most intense signal in the cyclohexane fragmentation mass spectrum) and m/z =28 and 44 signals accounting for possible fragmentation of the cyclohexane molecule. No signals of evolved compounds were detected thereby revealing that the interaction between cyclohexane and Co is negligible. The desorption of toluene, followed by the m/z =92 signal corresponding to the molecular ion, occurred as a small peak at 365K. Desorption of several C2 and C4 fragments (m/z =26, 28, 43 and 44 signals) associated with toluene decomposition into lighter hydrocarbons took place at 404K. Evolution of C2 and C4 fragments was also observed at higher temperatures, between 573 and 620K. These results showed that toluene adsorbs irreversibly on Co and decomposes at low and middle temperatures. The TPD of benzene was followed by recording the m/z =78 signal that corresponds to the molecular ion, and other signals representing fragments formed from benzene decomposition. Fig. 3 shows that no benzene desorption (m/z =78) was observed while significant evolutions for H2, C1 and C2 species (m/z =2, 16, 28) were detected at temperatures higher than 500K. These high-temperature evolutions reflect the decomposition of strongly chemisorbed benzene over Co. Finally, Fig. 3 shows that the desorption temperature maximum of the peaks corresponding to two of the most abundant methanol ions (m/z =31, 32) appeared at 381K. Two additional broad bands corresponding to high temperature H2 were detected at about 570K and 880K respectively, which were accompanied by C2 and C3 hydrocarbon fragment evolutions (m/z =28, 44). These evolutions indicate the presence of surface cobalt sites on which methanol adsorbs very strongly and decomposes at high temperatures. In summary, the TPD results of Fig. 3 indicate that the solvent–catalyst interaction strength in non-polar solvents follows the order benzene>toluene>cyclohexane."
6,Discussion,"Results of Fig. 2 and Table 1 show that the Co/SiO2 activity and selectivity greatly depend on the solvent nature. By analyzing the results obtained in non-polar solvents it is inferred that r BN 0 decreases while SBA increases in the sequence cyclohexane→toluene→benzene. These changes in catalyst activity and selectivity may be interpreted by taking into account that according to solvent TPD experiments the solvent–metal interaction strength on Co/SiO2 follows the order benzene>toluene>cyclohexane. The reaction mechanism of Scheme 1 predicts that formation of DBA requires the readsorption of BA on the Co surface to react with butylimine and produce the secondary amine. The selective formation of BA would be favored therefore when a strong solvent–Co interaction takes place and hampers the readsorption of BA on the metal surface. This assumption explains why SBA increases when cyclohexane is replaced by toluene or benzene following the solvent–Co interaction strength trend. Moreover, the fact that Co/SiO2 exhibits the highest activity in cyclohexane probably reflects also the very weak cyclohexane–Co interaction, because this solvent will not block any surface active sites for BN adsorption and conversion. The BA yield obtained in methanol was higher than in non-polar solvents. This result cannot be explained in terms of a stronger methanol–metal interaction strength because our solvent TPD results showed that the methanol adsorption on Co is weaker than that of benzene, for example. In an attempt of interpreting the highest BA selectivity observed in methanol, we analyzed the possible interactions occurring in the liquid phase between the solvent and BA. In Table 2 we present the values of classical polarity parameters (dipole moment μ and dielectric constant ε) and hydrogen-bond-donation (α) and hydrogen-bond-acceptance (β) properties for the solvents used in this work. The values corresponding to BN and BA are also included in Table 2. Non-polar solvents exhibit low μ and ε values and they have no capability to act as H bond donor (α=0). Methanol is a protic H-bond donor (β=0.98) solvent that exhibits high values for polarity parameters ε and μ. In contrast, BA is an H-bond acceptor molecule of β=0.72. Thus, a strong interaction is expected to exist between BA and protic methanol causing the BA solvation in the liquid phase. The BA molecules would be then surrounded by alcohol molecules that will hinder the BA adsorption on Co and, as a consequence, also the formation of DBA that occurs by surface condensation between BA and butylimine. The solvation of BA in methanol, i.e. a solvent–reactant interaction, would explain then the high selectivity to BA that Co/SiO2 exhibits in this alcohol."
7,Conclusions,"The Co/SiO2 activity and selectivity for the liquid-phase synthesis of n-butylamine from butyronitrile hydrogenation greatly depend on the solvent nature. In protic alcohols such as methanol, the solvent–butylamine interaction in the liquid phase controls the selectivity to n-butylamine. Methanol is an H-bond donor solvent that strongly interacts with H-bond acceptor n-butylamine and causes its solvation in the liquid phase. The n-butylamine molecules are then surrounded by alcohol molecules that hinder the n-butylamine adsorption on Co and, as a consequence, impede the formation of dibutylamine via surface condensation between n-butylamine and nitrene intermediates. When non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane, toluene or benzene are used, the solvent–catalyst interaction strength determines the selectivity to n-butylamine: the stronger the solvent–catalyst interaction the higher the n-butylamine yield. This is because a strong solvent–Co interaction hinders the readsorption of n-butylamine over the metal surface and, as a consequence, also decreases its condensation rate to dibutylamine."
