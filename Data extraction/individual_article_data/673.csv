0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the thriving development of clean and sustainable energy is conducive to solve the growing global warming and shortage of fossil fuels problems [1-3]. Hydrogen is regarded as a pollution-free clean energy carrier with high-energy density. To have a large-scale and efficient production of hydrogen, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process of water electrolysis is a feasible way, which has a high energy conversion efficiency [4,5]. At present, platinum (Pt) based catalysts are the most widespread and efficient catalysts, but their ultrahigh cost and low quantity limit their practical application [6-8]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, low-cost and abundant non-noble metal electrocatalysts. Till date, there have been several research works on complexes of transition metals [9-11], such as transition metal carbides [12,13], oxides [14,15], sulfides [16,17], phosphides [18,19], and selenides [20-22], etc. These materials present good electrical conductivity and outstanding catalytic activity [23]. However, their electrocatalytic performance is far inferior to Pt-based catalysts due to the limited hydrogen absorption capacity of the single metal compound. Compared to the single metal selenides or sulfides, the bimetallic compounds heterostructures display better HER properties for enhancing the conductivity and increasing the active sites of the materials [24]. The heterostructure may result in a strong electron interaction in the interfacial area, which can improve the electronic structure and charge transfer, thereby enhancing the hydrogen adsorption energy [25]. For example, Yan et al. synthesized FeS2/CoS2 heterostructured nanowires, which exhibited a good HER activity [26]. Chen et al. reported Fe-Mo selenide material, which displayed more significant HER performance than pure MoSe2 and FeSe2 catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 [27]. Zhang et al. stated that MoSe2/NiSe2 composite catalyst has better HER activity compared to MoSe2 and NiSe2 catalysts [28]. The introduction of carbon materials is also beneficial to enhance the HER properties of the material. Graphene, as a matrix, has excellent conductivity and large surface area. It can not only prevent the agglomeration of catalysts, but also accelerate their charge mobility [29-31]. Therefore, the composite catalyst including graphene can deliver good HER performance. Chen et al. proved that CoP@rGO material had better HER behavior than that of bare CoP in alkaline solution [32]. Wang et al. reported that MoS2@rGO hybrid material exhibited better HER activities with 160 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2, compared to the crumpled MoS2 with 400 mV at 10 mA cm−2 [33]. He et al. developed Fe3W3C NRs/RGO hybrid electrocatalyst, which showed superior activity in acidic solution [34]. Inspired with the above mentioned methods, the introduction of graphene in the composites and the interaction between the bimetallic complexes can improve the HER performance. Besides, catalysts are only effective for acidic or alkaline electrolyte, which is a challenge for both acid and alkali resistance of catalysts. Hence, it is urgent to develop the high-efficiency, robust and compatible HER materials in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes for different practical applications. In this work, the material composed of CoSe2, MoSe2 and rGO was prepared by a facile one-pot hydrothermal process. In the CoSe2-MoSe2/rGO hybrid material, CoSe2-MoSe2 nanoparticles are uniformly attached to the graphene sheets. The hybrid electrocatalyst shows good HER activity and stability in acidic and alkaline solutions due to the heterostructure formed by CoSe2-MoSe2 and the introduction of rGO. In order to optimize the HER performance, a variety of CoSe2-MoSe2 catalysts with various Co/Mo proportions were prepared and tested, it’s concluded that the optimum proportion of CoSe2 and MoSe2 was determined as 1–1. In (acidic/alkaline) solution, the CoSe2-MoSe2/rGO owns an overpotential of 107/182 mV at 10 mA cm−2, and Tafel slope of 56/89 mV dec−1. The unique structure with bimetallic compound modified graphene sheets has a broad application prospect in hydrogen evolution in both solutions."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, ethylenediamine, Se powder, Nafion (5 wt%) and carbon cloth were obtained from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd. The chemicals were at the analytical level and no further treated."
3,Pretreatment of carbon cloth,"2.2 Pretreatment of carbon cloth The carbon cloth (CC) purchased required simple pretreatment. Firstly, the CC was carefully cut into the same size (1 cm × 1 cm). Then, it was ultrasonic washed with acetone for 15 mins. Finally, it was washed for several times with water and then dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h."
4,Synthesis of a series of CoSe2-MoSe2/rGO catalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of a series of CoSe2-MoSe2/rGO catalysts Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared in advance according to a modified Hummers’ method [33]. The CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO sample was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process. Firstly, 0.17 mmol (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 1.2 mmol Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O were added to 10 mL deionized water, respectively. After stirring vigorously for 20 mins, 5 mL GO (10 mg ml−1) aqueous solution was dripped into the above mixture. The obtained solution was stirred for another 1 h to achieve uniform dispersion. Then, 4.8 mmol Se powder and 25 mL ethylenediamine were added and kept stirred continuously for 15 mins. The obtained solution was poured in a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL) and heated at 200 °C for 20 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the powder was collected by centrifuging the solution with water and alcohol and dried at 60 °C. Similarly, MoSe2/rGO and CoSe2/rGO samples were synthesized by adjusting the existence of Co or Mo precursor. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–3), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–2), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), CoSe2-MoSe2(2–1), CoSe2-MoSe2(3–1), MoSe2 and CoSe2 materials were synthesized by changing the ratio of Co/Mo precursors with the same total molar amount without introducing GO. By changing the GO amount, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO with different rGO amounts were obtained. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO with 10 mg, 30 mg, 50 mg and 70 mg of rGO are named as CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-10, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-30, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-50 and CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-70, respectively."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The model of X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment is Rigaku TTR III. Raman spectroscopy was conducted in Raman microscope (Xplora Plus, Horiba). Scanning electron microscope (SEM, JME-7500F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) were conducted to examine the sample’s morphology. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to characterize the chemical states of the sample on Thermo ESCALAB with Al Kα radiation. The ratio of CoSe2 and MoSe2 was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The content of graphene in the compound was investigated by thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA)."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements HER properties were studied on a workstation (PGSTAT 302) in an acidic (or alkaline) solution with a three-electrode system. Ag/AgCl electrode (with saturated KCl) in 0.5 M H2SO4 or saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 1 M KOH were used as the reference electrode, respectively, and graphite rod was used as a counter electrode. To prepare the working electrode, the uniform mixture of 6 mg CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO, 250 μL C2H5OH, 750 μL H2O and 20 μL (5 wt%) Nafion solution was dripped onto the CC several times. Then, it was dried at 60 °C for 1 h. The loading of the sample was about 2.9 mg cm−2. The same method was conducted to prepare the work electrodes of the other contrasting materials. In all the electrochemical tests, the measured overpotential was converted into that vs. RHE by the conversion formula (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl/E SCE + 0.197/0.242 + 0.0592 × pH) [35]. The electrode was firstly performed with cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 15 mins to activate the electrocatalyst before all the tests. The scan rate of LSV measurement was 5 mV s−1 and corrected by IR contribution. The potential of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests was −300/350 mV vs. RHE in acidic/alkaline solution with 100 k to 0.01 Hz. The chronopotentiometry was performed at 10 mA cm−2, and 1000 cycles CV was tested with 100 mV s−1."
7,Theoretical calculations,"2.6 Theoretical calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out to understand the potential mechanisms of the enhanced performance of CoSe2-MoSe2 heterostructure with the Cambridge sequential total energy package (CASTEP) program of Material Studio (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The effects of exchange-related interaction were treated according to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized-gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [36,37]. The convergence criterion of the energy was 280 eV. For the (210) plane of CoSe2, a 3 × 2 × 2 k‐point sampling was adopted. A 3 × 2 × 1 k‐point sampling was used for both the (002) planes of MoSe2 and the CoSe2-MoSe2. The convergence was obtained with these parameters and the total energy was converged to 1.0 × 10−5 eV/atom. Phonon calculations were performed with finite displacement method at 298 K and zero point energy (ZPE) properties. The chemical adsorption energy of each hydrogen was calculated by ΔGH*=1/n(Gsurf-nH- Gsurf-nGH2/2), where n, Gsurf+nH, Gsurf and GH2 stand for the H atoms adsorbed number on the surface, the total surface energy with n H-adsorbed, the total surface energy without H-adsorbed, and H2 energy."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The structure and morphology,"3.1 The structure and morphology The schematic illustration shows the synthetic procedure of the samples with a simple hydrothermal process (Fig. 1 a). The phase composition was examined by the XRD measurement. The XRD patterns of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), CoSe2/rGO, CoSe2, MoSe2/rGO and MoSe2 samples are displayed in Fig. 1b. The peaks located at 2θ = 26.32°, 30.49°, 34.19°, 37.57°, 43.66°, 46.46°, 51.70°, 54.18°, 56.59°, 58.93°, 63.45°, 65.65°, 67.80°, 69.92°, 72.02°, 74.09° and 76.14° can be indexed to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (221), (311), (222), (023), (321), (400), (410), (411), (331), (024), (421) and (332) planes of CoSe2 (JCPDS no.88-1712). In addition, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 13.74°, 34.24° and 55.99° are assigned to (002), (102) and (110) of MoSe2 (JCPDS no.17-0887). These diffraction peaks are not obvious due to the poor crystallization of MoSe2. The peak at 23.60° indicates the successful reduction of GO during the synthesis of the composites [38]. In addition, the XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) of CoSe2-MoSe2 materials with different Co/Mo ratios reveal that the characteristic peak intensity of CoSe2 was gradually enhanced with the increasing Co content. The mechanism of the synthesis is as follows: during the synthesis process, GO had many oxygen-containing functional groups with negative valence, which can attract positive Co and Mo ions. Ethylenediamine reduced GO to rGO, and reduced Se powder to Se ions. Se ions and Co ions further combined to form CoSe2, and Se ions and Mo ions further combined to form MoSe2. As the CoSe2 composition and MoSe2 composition are mixed, the CoSe2-MoSe2 heterojunction was also formed on rGO. Eventually, the CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO was synthesized [28,39]. (1) Se → C 2 H 8 N 2 Se 2 - (2) Mo 6 + → C 2 H 8 N 2 Mo 4 + (3) Mo 4 + + Se 2 - → MoSe 2 (4) Co 2 + + Se 2 - → CoSe 2 The morphologies of the obtained materials were examined by SEM and TEM measurements. In SEM images (Fig. 1d and S1) of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO, the CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) nanosheets are attached to the rGO surface. The SEM images of CoSe2, CoSe2/rGO, MoSe2 and MoSe2/rGO are shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the pure CoSe2 and pure MoSe2 have obvious agglomeration. However, CoSe2 or MoSe2 has good dispersibility on rGO because rGO promotes the dispersion of nanoparticles to prevent agglomeration. In addition, the SEM images of CoSe2-MoSe2 with different proportions are displayed in Fig. S3. With the improper proportion of CoSe2, the agglomeration of CoSe2-MoSe2 is more distinct. The reunion phenomenon is less obvious with the optimized ratio of CoSe2-MoSe2 (1–1). In Fig. 1e and 1f, the TEM images show that the thickness of a single CoSe2-MoSe2 nanosheet is about 3.8–9.8 nm. In Fig. 1g, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image displays crystal lattice spacing of 0.2394 and 0.6442 nm, which are attributed to CoSe2 (211) and MoSe2 (002), respectively. These planes can be indexed and correspond to CoSe2 (JCPDS no.88-1712) and MoSe2 (JCPDS no.17-0887). The EDX elemental mapping images of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO are exhibited in Fig. S4. The identified elements of Co, Mo and Se are distributed uniformly. Tab. S1 summarizes the actual Co to Mo atomic ratios of the materials explored by ICP-MS. It demonstrates that the Co to Mo atomic ratio of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is about 49.09: 50.91. As expected, the actual Co to Mo ratios of samples are basically as the same as the added ratios of precursors."
10,"Raman, TGA, XPS and density of state analysis","3.2 Raman, TGA, XPS and density of state analysis Fig. 2 a presents the Raman spectra of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO and GO. The D band (1350 cm−1) and G band (1595 cm−1) correspond to amorphous carbon sp3-like and sp2-hybridized graphitic, respectively [22]. The ID/IG ratio (1.11) of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is larger than that (0.86) of GO, indicating that GO has been successfully converted into rGO [38]. TGA was performed to verify the content of rGO in the composite material. Fig. 2b shows the TGA curves of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO and CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) catalysts. It demonstrates that the amount of rGO in CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO catalyst is 28.64%. The graphene matrix can provide more electrically conductive pathways of composite material, contributing to the enhancement of HER activity. Raman measurement was further employed to characterize the rGO in the composite catalyst. XPS was employed to probe into the atomic valence states of the sample. Co, Mo, Se and C elements of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO material were identified in the XPS spectra (Fig. 2c-2f). In Fig. 2c, the features peaks of Co3+ 2p3/2 and Co3+ 2p1/2 focus on 779.0 and 794.0 eV, corresponding to Co3+ species. The peaks of Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2 concentrate in 782.0 and 796.6 eV, corresponding to Co2+ species. In addition, the peaks located at 786.5 and 801.3 eV correspond to the satellite peaks [40]. In Fig. 2d, the peaks of Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 appear on 228.5 and 231.7 eV, corresponding to Mo4+ species. The characteristic peaks of Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2 are centered at 232.9 and 235.9 eV, corresponding to Mo6+ species. And the other peak at 229.7 eV is associated with Se 3s of MoSe2 [41]. Fig. 2e shows that the two peaks located at 54.0 and 54.9 eV are attributed to Se2− species (Se2− 3d5/2 and Se2− 3d3/2) [42]. In addition, the small peak at 59.6 eV is related to SeOx on account of the oxidation of Se [43]. As shown in Fig. 2f, the CC chemical bond is centered at the main peak of 284.8 eV, CO chemical bonds appear on 285.7 and 287.3 eV. The rest of the peak at 288.8 eV can be ascribed to OCO chemical bond. The strength of the C peak reflects the completed conversion from GO to rGO in the synthesis process [33]."
11,The HER performance in acidic medium,"3.3 The HER performance in acidic medium The HER performance of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO was conducted in acidic medium. In order to optimize the HER performance, the optimum ratio (1–1) of Co/Mo elements was determined by comparing the hydrogen evolution activities of the materials with different Co/Mo ratios (Fig. S5a-S5c). The overpotential of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) (195 mV) is smaller than that of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–2) (212 mV), CoSe2-MoSe2(2–1) (229 mV), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–3) (232 mV) and CoSe2-MoSe2(3–1) (238 mV) in acidic medium at 10 mA cm−2. Fig. S6a-S6c show the electrochemical performance of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO with different amounts of rGO. The overpotential of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-50 (107 mV) is smaller than that of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) (195 mV), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-10 (178 mV), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-30 (137 mV) and CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-70 (123 mV) in acidic medium at 10 mA cm−2. For comparison, the HER performance of Pt/C, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), MoSe2/rGO, CoSe2/rGO, MoSe2 and CoSe2 were evaluated. The LSV curves without iR-correction of these catalysts are shown in Fig. S7. The LSV curves with iR-correction (Fig. 3 a) display the commercial Pt/C has the lowest overpotential among the materials. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has 107 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than that of MoSe2/rGO (141 mV), CoSe2/rGO (156 mV), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) (195 mV), MoSe2 (243 mV) and CoSe2 (254 mV). The overpotentials in acidic medium have been summarized in Fig. 3c. These prove that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has the best HER performance among all the synthetic catalysts. Tafel slope is applied to explore the electrocatalytic kinetics of the catalyst. The Tafel points are associated with data of LSV curve (η = blog(j) + a, where η, j and b represent overpotential, current density and Tafel slope, respectively). Fig. 3b shows the Tafel slopes of the as-prepared materials in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The commercial Pt/C shows the smallest Tafel slope among all the materials. The Tafel slope of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO (56 mV dec−1) is much smaller than that of MoSe2/rGO (62 mV dec−1), CoSe2/rGO (64 mV dec−1), CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) (66 mV dec−1), MoSe2 (73 mV dec−1) and CoSe2 (76 mV dec−1). This reveals that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has more positive reaction kinetics than the others (Fig. 3b and 3c). Based on previous papers, the Tafel slope reflects the reaction rate-controlling step. Different Tafel slopes (30, 40, and 120 mV dec−1) indicate different steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer). The Tafel slope of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is 56 mV dec−1 in acidic medium, suggesting the combination of Volmer-Heyrovsky is the rate-determining step. Generally, double-layer capacitance (Cdl ) is related to electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The catalyst with larger value of ECSA would have more active site and better electrocatalytic performance. Fig. S8 displays the CV curves of catalysts with different scan rates (20–200 mV s−1) with 0.1–0.2 V vs. RHE in acidic solution. As illustrated in Fig. 3d, the data was obtained by the anodic and cathodic current density difference (△j = J a - J c) at 0.15 V vs. RHE. The twice Cdl value was obtained by the half of scan rate and △j fitting. The Cdl value of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is larger than those of the other materials, demonstrating that the ECSA of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is larger than that of these materials in acidic solution. EIS analysis is used to further explore the electrode kinetics. Fig. 3e shows the Nyquist plots of the synthesized materials in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium. And the illustration of Fig. 3e reveals the corresponding equivalent circuit model. Rs and Rct mean the solution resistance and charge-transfer resistance, respectively. Under acidic medium, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct ) of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO (4.1 Ω) is smaller compared to those of the others (5.1 Ω of MoSe2/rGO, 9.9 Ω of CoSe2/rGO, 18.1 Ω of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), 67.0 Ω of MoSe2 and 120.2 Ω of CoSe2). It demonstrates that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has fast electron transfer rate, meaning better HER performance. Stability is an important parameter to evaluate the possibility of practical application. Fig. 3f exhibits the potential-time curve at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic electrolyte. It is observed that the overpotential has no obvious change even after 15 h HER procedure. The retention rate of the overpotential is 92.5% after testing for 15 h, indicating that the well long-time stability of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO. In addition, the illustration of Fig. 3f exhibits the LSV comparison of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO between the initial curve and the one after 1000 cycles CV. It shows that the LSV curves almost coincide, indicating the good cycling stability of the catalyst."
12,The HER performance in alkaline medium,"3.4 The HER performance in alkaline medium Besides acidic electrolyte, the CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO also owns outstanding HER performance in alkaline electrolyte. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) also has the best HER performance among CoSe2-MoSe2 with different ratios of Co/Mo in 1 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. S5d-S5f). Fig. S6a-S6c display that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO-50 owns the best electrochemical performance among CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO with different amounts of rGO in 1 M KOH. Fig. 4 a shows the commercial Pt/C has the lowest overpotential. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO presents 182 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline electrolyte, which is lower than that of MoSe2/rGO, CoSe2/rGO, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), MoSe2 and CoSe2. As shown in Fig. 4b, the commercial Pt/C shows the smallest Tafel slope. And the Tafel slope of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is 89 mV dec−1, the value is smaller than that of the others. The Tafel slope suggests that the combination of Volmer-Heyrovsky is also the rate-determining step in 1 M KOH electrolyte. These overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes have been summarized in Fig. 4c. As illustrated in Fig. S9, the CV curves were obtained with 0.5–0.6 V vs. RHE in alkaline solution. In Fig. 4d, the Cdl value of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is larger than those of the others, proving that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has the biggest ECSA among these materials. Moreover, the Rct value (6.9 Ω) of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is smaller than those of others (8.3 Ω of MoSe2/rGO, 11.8 Ω of CoSe2/rGO, 22.1 Ω of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), 73.6 Ω of MoSe2 and 124.1 Ω of CoSe2) in alkaline medium (Fig. 4e). It demonstrates that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has faster electron transfer rate in alkaline solution. Fig. 4f exhibits the overpotential-time curve of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO at 10 mA cm−2, which shows the overpotential has no obvious change after 15 h. The retention rate of the overpotential after 15 h is 98.4% in alkaline electrolyte, implying the well long-time stability of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO. In addition, as shown in illustrations of Fig. 4f, the LSV curves almost coincide after 1000 cycles CV, proving that the good cycling stability of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Tab. S2 and S3 summarize the comparison of HER performance between CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO and similar materials previously reported in both conditions."
13,Characterization of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO after the 15 h stability test in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes,"3.5 Characterization of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO after the 15 h stability test in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes The compositions of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO after 15 h stability test was studied by XRD. Fig. 5 a shows the XRD curves of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO before and after the 15-hour stability reaction in acidic/alkaline electrolytes. XRD curves of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO after the reaction includes the sample on the CC and the sample scraped off the CC. Except for the peak at 23.90° (CC), all the peaks after the test correspond to the peaks before testing. The absence of other distinct peaks verifies to the stability of the CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO during the HER reaction in both electrolytes. In Fig. 5b and 5c, the SEM images of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO (the scraped from CC) after the test in both electrolytes display that the morphology of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO is almost as similar as that before the test (Fig. 1d). Fig. 5d and 5e show the SEM images of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO (containing CC). Whether in the acidic or alkaline electrolyte, the morphology of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) nanosheets attached to the rGO surface still can be observed in the SEM image of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO attached to the CC after the stability test for 15 h. These results demonstrate that CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has no obvious change in morphology after the test in both electrolytes."
14,Possible HER mechanism in both media and the theoretical calculation,"3.6 Possible HER mechanism in both media and the theoretical calculation Probable catalytic HER mechanism of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO catalyst in acidic and alkaline media are displayed in Fig. 6 a and 6b, respectively, including: H3O+ + e− → Had + H2O (Volmer reaction), H3O+ + Had + e− → H2 (Heyrovsky reaction) and Had + Had → H2 in acidic medium, H2O + e− → Had + OH− (Volmer reaction), H2O + Had + e− → H2 + OH− (Heyrovsky reaction) and Had + Had → H2 (Tafel reaction) in alkaline medium. To explore the enhancement mechanism of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO, the interface electronic property of CoSe2-MoSe2 heterostructure was studied by the DFT calculation. According to the data of HRTEM (Fig. 1g), the crystallographic orientation relationship for the (210) plane of CoSe2 and the (002) plane of MoSe2 can be estimated. Comparing the density of states curves in Fig. S10a-10c, the Fermi level was enhanced due to the optimized CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) interface structure. In addition, the value of the band gap is an important factor to evaluate the electrical conductivity. The optimized structures of CoSe2, MoSe2 and CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) were established and shown in insets of Fig. S10a-10c, respectively. The band gap of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) heterostructure (0.024 eV) is smaller than that of CoSe2 (210) (0.047 eV) and MoSe2 (002) (2.029 eV). It implies that the interface of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) heterostructure is conducive to improve the electronic conductivity, which can accelerate the reaction kinetics and increase catalytic HER activity. Moreover, the band gap of the sample was also measured by ultraviolet spectrograph [44]. The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra with the Tauc analyses of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), CoSe2 and MoSe2 are shown in Fig. 6c. Although the measured band gap values are larger than the theoretical values, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO (1.425 eV) has a smaller band gap than CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) (1.482 eV), CoSe2 (1.570 eV) and MoSe2 (3.568 eV). To further understand the catalytic efficacies of the interface of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) heterostructure, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) of CoSe2, MoSe2 and CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) are shown in Fig. S10d. Intrinsically, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) (−1.84 eV) shows smaller ΔGH* compared to CoSe2 (−3.86 eV) and MoSe2 (−2.00 eV), suggesting that the interface of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) heterostructure can promote HER activity, which is consistent with the previous research [25]."
15,Comparative analysis of HER properties,"3.7 Comparative analysis of HER properties Compared to CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1), MoSe2/rGO, CoSe2/rGO, CoSe2 and MoSe2, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO owns the lower overpotential either in acidic or alkaline condition. Due to the introduction of rGO, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO shows a lower overpotential than that of CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1). Furthermore, CoSe2/rGO and MoSe2/rGO show lower overpotentials than pure CoSe2 and pure MoSe2, respectively. This is due to the interaction between the rGO and selenide, which can increase the conductivity and improve the faster electron transfer efficiency of the material. In addition, the HER performance of CoSe2-MoSe2 surpasses those of pure CoSe2 and MoSe2 due to the optimized hydrogen adsorption energy and fast HER reaction kinetics of the CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1) heterostructure. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO shows the best HER performance among all the catalysts. This is because rGO and heterostructure boost intrinsic activity, enhance the electronic conductivity, accelerate charge-transfer and benefit better HER activity."
16,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the synthesized CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO by one-step hydrothermal method is a high-efficiency catalyst. CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO has 107 mV (or 182 mV) at 10 mA cm−2, Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1 (or 89 mV dec−1) in acidic (or alkaline) medium. The superior HER performance results from the structure of the bimetallic compound decorated with rGO. In this unique structure, rGO can improve the conductivity of the composites. Furthermore, DFT calculation results further verify that the CoSe2-MoSe2 interface has the optimized hydrogen adsorption energy, good conductivity and fast reaction kinetics, contributing to the improvement of the whole performance. Hence, CoSe2-MoSe2(1–1)/rGO prepared by the simple, low-cost synthetic procedure is a promising catalyst with high performance for HER in acidic and alkaline media."
