0,Introduction,"Diesel engines are indispensable equipment in public transportation, heavy-duty machinery, power generation, and agricultural and industrial equipment owing to their higher fuel-conversion efficiency, power output, torque capacity, durability, and reliability over gasoline engines [1,2]. However, diesel engines produce significant amounts of gaseous air pollutants (especially NOX) and particulate matter. These emissions are factors in causing disease, and can lead to a decline in human immunity [3–6]. In recent years, fast depletion of fossil fuel and higher pollution levels have forced governments to implement stringent emission norms, and researchers have conducted intensive research on alternative and clean energy in diesel engines [7–11]. Primary alcohol has a hydroxyl radical connected to a primary carbon; the examples include methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol [12]. There are many advantages of primary alcohol fuels replacing fossil fuels, including the characteristics of being colorless, a pure substance, and producible from many resources such as biomass, natural gas, or coal [13]. Furthermore, the higher oxygen content and the existence of the hydroxyl (OH) group of primary alcohol fuels enhance the soot oxidation during the controlled mixing and late combustion phases. This leads to lower opacity levels, particularly at high engine operating loads [14,15]. Primary alcohol fuels have high octane numbers and can be used directly in spark ignition engines with flexible injection such as alcohol single fuel mode and alcohol/gasoline dual fuel mode [16,17]. However, the direct use of primary alcohol fuels in diesel engines without ignition assistance is difficult because they have low cetane numbers and viscosity. Hence, alcohol fuels have been mostly used in diesel engines with alcohol/diesel blend mode and dual-fuel mode [18]. It well-known that the common rail direct injection (CRDI) technology has been widely used in diesel engines, and a CRDI diesel engine can be easily converted to a dual-fuel engine by adding an alcohol injector to the intake ports [19]. Furthermore, with dual injection in the alcohol/diesel dual-fuel combustion mode, the alcohol substitute percentage can be flexible and instantaneously controlled online based on the engine demand under different operating conditions. Methanol (CH3OH) can be produced from natural gas, biomass, or based on coke oven gas. It can also be recovered through flashing evaporation during the continuous production of biodiesel via supercritical methanol [20]. Methanol has a high octane number, high latent heat of vaporization, and good lean-burn behaviors [21]. Meanwhile, the production process is relatively perfect. The cost of methanol is about one-third of that of gasoline and diesel, which makes the market prospects of methanol quite broad [22]. Nowadays, methanol is widely used as an alternative fuel in internal combustion engines, and many researchers have conducted relevant research on the use of alcohol/diesel dual fuel in diesel engines. Yao et al. [23,24] proposed the diesel methanol compound combustion (DMCC) mode, which is realized by injecting methanol with low pressure into the intake manifold and the methanol-air mixture formed therein. Then, the mixture in the cylinder is ignited by diesel fuel spray around the top dead center (TDC) of the engine. Furthermore, the DMCC mode was developed using an engine bench test and a vehicle road test. Some of the latest and most important studies on methanol/diesel dual fuel mode are listed in Table 1 . Ethanol (C2H5OH) is obtained from fermentable material and agricultural feedstock. It is a clean-burning, colorless, flammable, volatile, neutral, and oxygenated hydrocarbon [25]. Compared with methanol, ethanol shows better combustion characteristics owing to its lower enthalpy of vaporization and auto-ignition temperature. However, ethanol and methanol have a common problem owing to their low enthalpy of vaporization and their requirement for intake air preheated from combustion. In addition, mixing these fuels with diesel fuel is not straightforward owing to miscibility problems [26]. There have been numerous studies related to the combustion performance and emissions of diesel engines in ethanol/diesel dual fuel mode, as shown in Table 2 . n-Butanol (C4H9OH) can be produced from food waste and from biomes, eukaryotic bioorganisms, and other plant constituents containing cellulose [27]. n-Butanol has the advantages of higher heating value and viscosity, lower volatility and vaporization heat, and much lower hygroscopic and corrosive characteristics in comparison with methanol and ethanol [28]. Recently, very efficient techniques for the production of n-butanol were developed and n-butanol gained worldwide attention [29]. Most researchers observed that by adding n-butanol to neat diesel soot, nanoparticles, and CO emissions are significantly reduced without any changes in the brake specific fuel consumption and NOX. Table 3 lists relevant studies on n-butanol/diesel dual fuel engines. Non-road engines are mainly used in agricultural machinery, agricultural vehicles, engineering machinery, and industrial machinery. They consume a significant quantity of diesel, which results in an increase in energy demand for diesel fuel every year [45]. The European Commission recently tightened the emissions standards for non-road diesel engines [46]. To comply with the III- and IV-stage emission regulations for diesel engines of non-road mobile machinery in China, it is necessary to reduce the environmental impact caused by engines and encourage the use of biofuels, which are renewable and locally available throughout the year [47,48]. The non-road high-pressure common rail diesel engine has been extensively deployed in agricultural and engineering machinery. With a CRDI system, the injection timing, injection pressure, and injection quantity of diesel can be precisely controlled by the engine control unit (ECU). Furthermore, the engine has the characteristics of low emissions, low noise, low idle speed, good cold-start performance, and high reliability. In summary, there have been extensive research studies on methanol/diesel, ethanol/diesel, and n-butanol/diesel dual fuel in a compression ignition engine. However, there have been few comparative studies on the combustion and emissions of (methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol)/diesel dual fuel in a non-road CRDI compression ignition engine. Meanwhile, non-road diesel engines face an urgent need for alternative fuels and reduced emissions. In this paper, a combustion and emissions analysis of primary alcohol fuels (methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol)/diesel dual fuel with alcohol substitute percentages of 0% (pure diesel fuel), 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% was carried out. Further, the combustion characteristics and emissions of diesel with different alcohol fuel additions were compared and evaluated. The combustion parameters [such as cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), ignition delay, CA50, and combustion duration], performance (including BTE, RI, and COVIMEP), and emissions (such as THC, CO, NOX, and smoke) of the primary alcohol fuel/diesel dual-fuel engine were comparatively examined with various ASP values. The results of this study are intended to provide valuable insights for improving the performance of non-road compression ignition engines fueled by diesel and primary alcohol fuels operating under dual-fuel mode."
1,Experimental setup and procedure,
2,Experimental engine and fuel,"2.1 Experimental engine and fuel In this study, a single-cylinder, air-cooled, naturally aspirated, CRDI diesel engine with a displacement of 0.498 L and compression ratio of 17.0 was changed to a dual-fuel mode. Table 4 presents the main specifications of the test engine, and Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the experimental test bench. To enable operation in alcohol/diesel dual-fuel mode, an alcohol port fuel injection system including a fuel pump,relief valve, andinjector was added. The diesel injection pressure was maintained at 100 MPa, and the alcohol injection pressure was maintained at 0.45 MPa. Furthermore, the injection timing and injection duration of the diesel and alcohol fuels were controlled precisely by a self-designed electronic control unit, and the hardware was based on the SPC563M64 chip. The experimental tests were carried out using commercially available diesel and three primary alcohol fuels operating in dual-fuel mode. The current study used absolute methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol with a purity of 99%, while the diesel fuel was purchased from a local gas station. The properties of the diesel and alcohol fuels are listed in Table 5 ."
3,Experiment instrumentation,"2.2 Experiment instrumentation As shown in Fig. 1, the test engine was controlled by an AC electrical dynamometer (Powerlink CAC37). The engine load and speed were controlled by a 37-kW electrical dynamometer.A Kistler 6058A piezoelectric pressure transducer was installed in the cylinder head and was used to obtain the cylinder pressure. A combustion analyzer (Kistler Ki-Box) was employed to process the cylinder pressure signal. A highly precise electric balance (Heng Odd ES30K-1) and a mass flow meter (Emerson CMF025) were used to measure the consumption of diesel and alcohol fuels separately. A thermal mass flow meter (TOCEIL 20N080) installed before the air surge tank was used to show the intake air flow rate. Exhaust temperatures was measured witha K-type thermocouple, and the cylinder head temperature was measured with a PT100 sensor on the cylinder head. Regular exhaust emissions were sampled directly from the exhaust pipe. Then, the samples were sucked into an automotive exhaust emissions analyzer (HORIBA MEXA-584L) and the CO, THC, and NOX emissions were measured. The smoke capacity was measured using an opacimeter (Horiba MEXA-600S). Information on the experimental instruments in this study is listed in Table 6 . In this study, the cylinder pressure and its corresponding crank angle were recorded with a Ki-Box combustion analyzer for 200 consecutive cycles with resolution of 0.1 °CA. Combustion characteristics such as the HRR, ignition delay, CA50, combustion duration, mean in-cylinder temperature, and COVIMEP were calculated directly by the Ki-Box Cockpit software. Measured exhaust emissions such as the THC (ppm), NOX (ppm), CO (% vol), and smoke (% of opacity) were converted to BSTHC, BSNOX, BSCO, and BSsoot in g/kW·h−1 according to the related literature [51,52]."
4,Experimental procedures,"2.3 Experimental procedures All experiments were conducted at an engine maximum torque speed of 2500 rpm and a fixed load at 0.75 MPa IMEP (about 100% engine load). Diesel fuel with single direct injection was used at a fixed injection timing of −13 °CA ATDC and injection pressure of 100 MPa for all test conditions. Under dual-fuelcombustion mode, alcohol fuels were injected into the intake port with an injection timing of −136 °CA ATDC (intake valve closing timing) and injection pressureof 0.45 MPa. Meanwhile, diesel was directly injected into the cylinder aspilot fuel. In dual-fuel combustion mode, the injection quantity of the diesel fuel was decreased, and the injection quantities of the primary alcohol fuels were increased to keep the IMEP unchanged. The ASP was adjusted to 10, 20, 30, and 40% (when the substitution ratios of methanol and ethanol exceeded 40%, the engine could misfire and malfunction or stall). In this study, methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol were used as substitutes for diesel fuel. Fig. 2 shows the experimental procedure and the corresponding experimental steps, and Table 7 lists the operation conditions and basic experimental data. In addition, the ASP was defined as the percentage of the quantity of diesel replaced by alcohol fuels to the original diesel quantity. The ASP is defined by Eq. (1): (1) ASP = m d - m dm m d × 100 % where md is the mass flow rate of diesel in pure diesel mode in kg/h, and mdm is the measured mass flow rate of diesel in dual-fuel mode in kg/h."
5,Error and uncertainty analysis,"2.4 Error and uncertainty analysis It is known that estimations made deliberately may be free from complete uncertainties [53]. The error and uncertainty analysis is conducted to determine the precision of experiments. Experimental precision is based on the observation, test planning, equipment selection, condition, calibration, environment, and readings. Thus, the error and uncertainty analysis is a useful tool to comprehend the effects of numerous factors including measurement device selection, calibration of the device, ambient temperature and pressure, and measurement responsible. In this study, errors in the measured parameters appear as a result of random errors that were predicted based upon analytical methods [54] and calculated using Eq. (2). Meanwhile, the uncertainties in the calculated parameters were determined based on the route mean square method [55] and calculated using Eq. (3). (2) δ X = r min / x min where δX is the error of the measuring parameter, rmin is the minimum scale of the experimental instruments, and xmin is the minimum measured value. (3) R = R ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , ⋯ , x n ) (4) δ c = [ ( ∂ R ∂ x 1 δ X 1 ) 2 + ( ∂ R ∂ x 2 δ X 2 ) 2 + ( ∂ R ∂ x 3 δ X 3 ) 2 ⋯ + ( ∂ R ∂ x n δ Xn ) 2 ] 0.5 where R is the measuring parameter that is a function of independent variables x1 , x2 , x3 , …, xn ; δc is the uncertainty in the calculated parameter; and δX1 , δX2 , δX3 , …, δXn are the errors of the independent variables. Errors and uncertainties of the parameters in this study are listed in Table 8 ."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Combustion analysis,"3.1 Combustion analysis The effects of the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels on the in-cylinder pressure and HRR at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm are presented in Fig. 3 (a)–(c). Compared with pure diesel, the addition of the primary alcohol fuels significantly decreased the peak of cylinder pressure (Pmax). Moreover, the greater the ASP, the lower the Pmax. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 40%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased the Pmax from the baseline value of 65.2 bar to 46.0, 55.4, and 62.4 bar, respectively. This observation can be explained in two ways. First, the primary alcohol fuels all have considerably high latent heats of vaporization (as indicated in Table 5), which lead to significant cylinder temperature and pressure reductions owing to the cooling effect significantly cooling effects results in the in-cylinder temperature and pressure reduction [56]. The other is that the primary alcohol fuels have higher low-heat values than pure diesel fuel in the stoichiometric air-fuel mixture (as indicated in Table 5). As indicated in Fig. 3, the maximum heat release rate (HRRmax) first increased and reached a maximum in the ASP of 30% and then decreased in the ASP of 40%, and its corresponding crank angle occurred later with an increase in ASP. Specifically, the maximum HRRmax of methanol/diesel, ethanol/diesel, and n-butanol/diesel is 86.0, 87.1, and 90.2 J/°CA, respectively. Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that the crank angle of HRRmax retarded with the increased ASP. This finding may be resulted from the long ignition delay and better evaporation of ethanol, which increased the fraction of combustible mixture prepared during the period of ignition delay, contributing to an increase in the maximum rate of heat release [57]. Fig. 4 (a)–(d) presents a different rendition of the effects of the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels on the in-cylinder pressure and HRR for four ASPs (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 4, the Pmax obtained by the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels were consistently lower than those obtained with pure diesel, and the n-butanol/diesel mixture had the highest Pmax value. Furthermore, the higher the ASP, the lower the Pmax. Similar trends were found in the HRR results. The n-butanol/diesel mixture had higher values of Pmax and HRRmax than those of the methanol/diesel and ethanol/diesel mixtures. Furthermore, the crank angle of Pmax and HRRmax occurred later with the increase in ASP. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 40%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol retarded the crank angle of Pmax retarded from the diesel baseline value of 8.6 °CA to 21.5, 16.0, and 10.7 °CA, respectively. Meanwhile, the crank angle of HRRmax retarded from the diesel baseline value of 5 °CA to 18, 12, and 7 °CA, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of methanol into the diesel produced the lowest values of Pmax and HRRmax. This is attributed to the longer ignition delay results from a higher latent heat of vaporization and lower low-heating value, which led to retarded combustion phasing and more fuel burns at the expansion stroke compared with ethanol and n-butanol. In this study, the ignition delay is the crank angle between the injection start and the burned start. The burned start is the crank angle of the burned fuel mass 10%. The burned end is the crank angle of the burned fuel mass 90%. The combustion duration is the crank angle from the burned start to the burned end [58]. Fig. 5 displays the ignition delay as a function of the ASP during the addition of the alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. The figure shows that the ignition delay is prolonged with the increment of ASP. Furthermore, the higher the ASP, the higher the ignition delay. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 40%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol increased the ignition delay from the diesel baseline value of 16.3 °CA to 27.4, 23.3, and 18.7 °CA, respectively. This finding can be explained by the lowering of the cetane number with an increase in methanol. Moreover, an increase in the heat of evaporation of the diesel/alcohol fuel mixtures with an increase in the ASP decreased the temperature of the cylinder gases owing to fuel evaporation, and this could also increase the ignition delay of the diesel/alcohol fuels [59,60]. As indicated in Fig. 5, for a special ASP, methanol has the longest ignition delay. This occurred because methanol has a higher heat of vaporization and lower low-heat value than ethanol and n-butanol, which results in a lower in-cylinder gas temperature. This temperature results from the evaporation of diesel/methanol mixtures and an increase in the ignition delay. Fig. 6 shows the combustion duration as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the combustion duration significantly decreased with an increase in the ASP after adding the alcohol fuels. Furthermore, the higher the ASP, the lower the combustion duration. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 40%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased the combustion duration from the diesel baseline value of 48.8 °CA to 35.2, 39.1, and 44.3 °CA, respectively. Two reasons could explain this result. First, the oxygen content of the three alcohol fuels was greater than that of diesel (as indicated in Table 2), which led to an increased combustion efficiency. The second reason is the presence of the hydroxyl group in the molecular formulas of all primary alcohol fuels, which may yield a large number of hydroxyl radicals that speed up the oxidation of primary alcohol fuels. This process results in faster burning rates of diesel/alcohol fuel mixtures [61,62]. As indicated in Fig. 6, for each ASP, methanol has the shortest combustion duration. This occurred because methanol has a higher laminar burning velocity and oxygen content than ethanol and n-butanol, which results in an increased combustion rate and combustion efficiency of the diesel/methanol fuel mixtures CA50 (the crank angle of the burned fuel mass 50%) is another essential parameter for evaluating the combustion characteristics of internal combustion engines. CA50 is frequently used to optimize the combustion process and reduce regulated emissions and fuel consumption [63,64]. Fig. 7 shows CA50 as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. It is clear from Fig. 7 that CA50 consistently decreased with the ASP from 0% to 30%. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 30%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased the CA50 from the diesel baseline value of 13.8 °CA to 12.7, 12.9, and 13.0 °CA, respectively. However, CA50 of the methanol/diesel and ethanol/diesel mixtures increased by 4.1 °CA and 2.3 °CA with the ASP from 30% to 40%, respectively. Further, Figs. 5 and 6 show that a decreased cetane number and increased heat of evaporation resulted in a prolonged ignition delay, and the increased oxygen content resulted in a shorter combustion delay, respectively. This occurred because the oxygen content of alcohol fuels plays a dominant role in decreasing CA50. However, when a large amount of alcohol fuels was injected into the cylinder, the in-cylinder temperature dropped sharply, which may have caused CA50 to stay away from TDC. As can be seen from Fig. 7, for ASPs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, the methanol/diesel mixture had the earliest CA50, followed by the ethanol/diesel and n-butanol/diesel mixtures. However, this trend was reversed at ASP = 40%."
8,Engine performance,"3.2 Engine performance The engine BTE indicates the efficiency of conversion of fuel chemical energy into mechanical energy. Fig. 8 displays the BTE as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the BTE was reduced significantly by adding the primary alcohol fuels. Furthermore, the higher the ASP, the lower the BTE. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 40%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased the BTE from the baseline value of 36.7% to 34.5%, 33.0%, and 31.8%, respectively. This may be due to the ignition delay of the dual-fuel combustion was prolonged, and the start timing of the combustion and combustion phase shifted backward, which led to a decrease in the heat-work conversion efficiency [65]. As indicated in Fig. 8, the BTE of the methanol/diesel mixture was higher than those of ethanol and n-butanol under the same ASP. This occurred because the oxygen content of methanol is the highest among the three primary alcohol fuels (as indicated in Table 2), which resulted in complete combustion. The stability and smoothness of an internal combustion engine can be evaluated based on the nonrepeatability of individual cycles of operation, which is typically represented by the coefficient of variation of the indicated mean effective pressure (COVIMEP) [66]. Fig. 9 displays the COVIMEP as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. As indicated in Fig. 9, COVIMEP decreased marginally as the ASP increased after the primary alcohol fuels were added. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 30%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased the COVIMEP from the baseline value of 1.9% to 1.1%, 1.3%, and 1.4%, respectively. However, if ASP is 40%, COVIMEP of the methanol/diesel increases by 5%. This is because the higher the ASP, the higher the oxygen content. This reflects a significant improvement in engine operation stability that results from a substantial amount of oxygen in the alcohol fuel. Fig. 9 also indicates that for a specific ASP, the methanol/diesel mixture had advantages over the ethanol/diesel and n-butanol/diesel mixtures in reducing COVIMEP at ASPs of 10%, 20%, and 30%. However, the methanol/diesel mixture had the highest COVIMEP at 40% ASP. The reason for this observation could be that methanol has a higher oxygen content than ethanol or n-butanol, which led to engine operation stability and smoothness. However, a prolonged ignition delay led to incomplete combustion and instability when the ASP of methanol and ethanol was 40% (as indicated in Fig. 5). In this study, the ringing/knocking intensity (RI) presented by Eq. (5) [67] was used to evaluate the knocking intensity as follows: (5) RI ≈ 1 2 γ × 0.05 × dP / d φ max 2 P max × γ R T max where the terms (dP/dφ), Pmax , Tmax , R, and γ indicate the peak pressure rise rate, peak cylinder pressure, peak cylinder temperature,universal gas constant, and specific heat ratio, respectively. The usual critical value of the allowable RI of 5 MW/m2 was adopted in this study [68]. Fig. 10 displays the RI as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the peak ringing/knock intensity was found to be 3.02 MW/m2, which is much lower than the critical knocking point (5 MW/m2). Therefore, there was no knocking under the operation condition. As indicated in Fig. 10, the RI first rose and then dropped as the ASP increased from 0% to 40%. The maximum RI of methanol/diesel and ethanol/diesel mixtures appeared in the ASP of 20%, with values of 2.14 MW/m2 and 2.14 MW/m2 respectively. However, the maximum RI of n-butanol/diesel mixture is 3.02 MW/m2 in the ASP of 30%. This increased RI could be explained in that adding alcohol fuel with high oxygen content resulted in an increase in the heat release rate. The in-cylinder combustion process became quite rough, and the combustion noise increased. Thus, the tendency for knocking was more obvious. However, when more alcohol fuel was injected into the cylinder, the in-cylinder temperature dropped sharply. This resulted in a decreased RI. As indicated in Fig. 10, the methanol/diesel mixture had the lowest RI under all operation conditions. Two reasons can account for this result. First, the octane number of methanol was higher than that of ethanol and n-butanol (as shown in Table 5). As a consequence, the antiknock capability of the methanol/diesel mixture might have been better than that of the ethanol/diesel and n-butanol/diesel mixtures. The second reason is that the methanol had the highest latent heat of vaporization and lowest low-heat value (as indicated in Table 5), which resulted in a greater mass fraction of methanol injected into the cylinder. In addition, the cooling effects were more pronounced."
9,Exhaust emissions,"3.3 Exhaust emissions In this section, the effects of the alcohol fuel additions at different ASPs on the exhaust emissions without aftertreatment are described. The following toxic compoundsof the exhaust were measured:THC,CO, NOx,and sootemissions. Fig. 11 displays the BSTHC emission as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. As indicated in Fig. 11, the BSTHC emissions increased marginally as the ASP increased after the primary alcohol fuels were added. Furthermore, the higher the ASP, the greater the BSTHC emissions. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 40%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol increased the BSTHC emissions from the baseline value of 0.14 g/kW·h−1 to 0.48, 0.34, and 0.29g/kW·h−1, respectively. In general, there are three BSTHC emission formation mechanisms in a dual-fuel engine. First, some premixed alcohol fuel is expelled from the cylinder during the scavenging phase that results from the valve overlap angle. This is not completely oxidized in the exhaust pipe, resulting in an increase in THC emissions. Second, as a result of the wall quenching effect, narrow gap effect, and adsorption and desorption effects of the lubricating oil film and sediment, some unburned alcohol fuel stays in the cylinder for a long time and is expelled during the exhaust process [69]. Third, the high latent heat of vaporization of primary alcohol fuels also tends to lower the combustion temperature, which might cause incomplete combustion and hence an increase in THC emissions [65]. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that the methanol/diesel mixture had the highest BSTHC emissions under all operating conditions because methanol has the greatest volatility (in general, the lower the boiling point, the stronger the volatility) and the lowest low-heat value (as indicated in Table 5). The greater volatility and lower low-heat value resulted in more methanol being injected into the cylinder, and more methanol expelled from the cylinder during the scavenging phase. CO is a colorless and odorless gas that is generated in internal combustion engines mainly owing to the incomplete burning of fuel. This is caused by insufficient oxygen and temperature in the combustion chamber [70]. Fig. 12 shows the BSCO emission as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. Fig. 12 shows a steady decrease in the amount of BSCO emissions with the addition of alcohol fuels. The ASP increased after the alcohol fuels were added. Furthermore, the higher the ASP, the lower the BSCO. Specifically, for an ASP increase of 30%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased the BSCO emissions from the baseline value of 3.1 g/kW·h−1 to 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7 g/kW·h−1, respectively. However, the BSCO emission increased by 23% from ASP 30% to 40%. This finding can be explained in two ways. First, the oxygen enrichment could effectively decrease the locally rich spray regions where CO was mainly formed. Second, oxygen enrichment could improve the post-flame oxidation of CO in the late engine expansion and exhaust processes [71]. As indicated in Fig. 12, the methanol/diesel mixture had the lowest BSCO emissions at 10%, 20%, and 30% ASP. This finding could be explained in that methanol has the greatest oxygen content among the three primary alcohol fuels. However, methanol/diesel had the highest BSCO emissions at 40% ASP. This can be explained in that the increased ignition delay and COVIMEP at an ASP of 40% (as indicated in Figs. 4 and 8) led to incomplete and unstable combustion, which resulted in higher BSCO emissions. NOX formation is generally dependent on the in-cylinder temperature, oxygen concentration, and gas residence time it takes for the reaction to take place [72]. Thus, the peak of the in-cylinder temperature (Tmax) is need to prove as it strongly correlated to NOX emissions. In this study, the in-cylinder temperature was determined through the equation of state for an ideal gas (PV = nRT) with the recorded cylinder pressure [73]. Fig. 13 shows the BSNOx emissions and Tmax as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. It can be seen in Fig. 13(a) that the BSNOX significantly increased after the alcohol fuels were added into diesel fuel. However, with the ASP increased from 30% to 40%, the BSNOX emissions of the methanol/diesel and ethanol/diesel mixtures decreased. Specifically, for an AESR increase of 30%, the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol increased the BSNOX emission from the baseline value of 8.2 g/kW·h−1 to 8.7, 9.0, and 9.5 g/kW·h−1, respectively. However, the BSNOX emissions of the methanol/diesel and ethanol/diesel mixtures decreased by 10% and 4% from ASP 30% to 40%, respectively. This occurred because the alcohol fuel led to an increase in the ignition delay and heat release, resulting in an increase in fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase and hence an increase in the combustion temperature [74]. The decrease in Tmax resulted in more methanol and ethanol being added at a higher ASP, which led to a decrease in BSNOX. Similar trends were found for Tmax [Fig. 13(b)]. As indicated in Fig. 13, the methanol/diesel mixture had the lowest BSNOX emissions under all operating conditions. This occurred because a more pronounced cooling effect resulted from the higher latent heat of vaporization and lower low-heat value of methanol (as indicated in Table 5), which led to a lower maximal in-cylinder temperature and reduced the BSNOX emissions. These trends were consistent with the Tmax results in Fig. 13(b). In general, the OH group in the molecular structure of alcohol promotes soot oxidation and results in lower soot emissions. However, the soot emission of alcohol fuel is also affected by other parameters such as the viscosity, cetane number, fuel carbon content, and ignition delay [14,75]. Fig. 14 displays the soot emissions as a function of the ASP during the addition of the three primary alcohol fuels at IMEP = 0.75 MPa and n = 2500 rpm. The soot emissions decreased significantly with the addition of the alcohol fuels, as shown in Fig. 14. Moreover, when the ASP was 40%, the BSsoot emissionsfor the engine fueled with methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol decreased by 95%, 91%, and 86%, respectively, compared with that of 0% ASP (pure diesel fuel). Two reasons could account for this result. First, an improvement in the diffusive combustion and the promotion of post-flame oxidation of smoke occurred in the late expansion and exhaust processes. Second, a decrease in the amount of diesel fuel burned during the diffusive combustion duration reduced exhaust smoke [76]. Furthermore, it was observed in Fig. 14 that the addition of methanol had the lowest soot emissions under all operating conditions. This finding can be explained in three ways. First, the lower viscosity of methanol led to better fuel atomization, resulting in the formation of smaller fuel droplet sizes, which led to a lower opacity level. The second reason is the lower carbon content of methanol over ethanol and n-butanol, which also decreases the opacity levels. Finally, methanol has the highest oxygen content among the three primary alcohol fuels, and this can accelerate the soot oxidation."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, a comparative analysis of the effects of the addition of methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol on the combustion characteristics and performance of a non-road common rail diesel engine was performed. The test engine was operated at a maximum torque speed of 2500 rpm with an IMEP of 0.75 MPa for different ASPs: 0% (pure diesel fuel), 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Adding primary alcohol fuels led to a decrease in Pmax and increase in HRRmax, and retarded the corresponding crank angle of Pmax and HRRmax. n-Butanol had the highest Pmax and HRRmax and the earliest corresponding crank angle of Pmax and HRRmax, followed by ethanol and methanol. (2) The ignition delay increased and the combustion duration decreased as the ASP increased in the dual-fuel engine fueled by primary alcohol fuels/diesel. At a specific ASP, the n-butanol/diesel mixture had the lowest ignition delay and the highest combustion duration, followed by the ethanol/diesel and methanol/diesel mixtures. (3) Adding primary alcohol fuels led to a decrease in BTE and COVIMEP, but RI first increased and then decreased as the ASP increased. At a specific ASP, the methanol/diesel had the highest BTE and the lowest COVIMEP and RI, and the BTE also increased. Furthermore, the methanol/diesel mixture had the highest BTE. (4) After adding alcohol fuels, THC and NOX emissions increased, and CO and soot emissions decreased. In particular, the methanol/diesel mixture produced the highest THC and the lowest CO, NOX, and soot emissions compared with the ethanol/diesel and n-butanol/diesel mixtures owing to its greater latent heat of vaporization and lower low-heat value. In the future, more experimental research is needed to study increments of ASP and BTE and the reduction of THC and NOX emissions by optimizing the injection parameters for diesel and alcohol fuel. This includes examining the injection pressure, injection timing, and number of diesel injections in a conventional alcohol/diesel dual fuel engine. Furthermore, experimental investigations will be conducted on a modified alcohol/diesel dual direct injection engine."
