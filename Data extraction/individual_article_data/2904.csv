0,Introduction,"Acetic acid (HAc) is an important chemical substance in the world, which is used widely. And it is an important raw material for chemical products to produce vinyl acetate, acetate, acetic anhydride, terephthalic acid, chloroacetic acid and diketene. Besides, as excellent organic solvents, acetic acid is widely used in chemical, textile, plastic, medicine, rubber and dye industry[1–3]. Meanwhile, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is also used widely in industry and daily life[4]. However, a large amount of wastewater containing HAc and HCl is produced during the production process of glucosamine[5] due to the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis process of chitin, which is not only harmful for the environment but also causes the loss of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid. Therefore, separating and recovering acetic acid from wastewater containing HAc and HCl will not only benefit economically and environmentally, but also can recycle hydrochloric acid. Various methods have been proposed to separate organic acids from aqueous solutions, including basic/anion ion-exchange resins[6–7], (catalytic) distillation[8], micro emulsion liquid membrane separation[9], esterification method[10] and liquid–liquid extraction[11–15]. Adsorption is regarded as a technology with high reliability to recover acetic acid from dilute and complex solutions. However, its capacity is limited and post-treatment is complicated, thus resulting that basic/anion ion-exchange resins is only suitable for dilute aqueous solution[7]. Distillation consumes a large amount of energy and reduce economic benefits, which isn’t cost-efficient and environmentally-friendly[8]. Esterification method needs to take extra steps to generate the ultimate product, resulting the increase of complexity of process[16].Membrane used in membrane separation method is expensive and easy to break. Meantime, the yield is low, therefore this method is unsuitable for large-scale industrial production[17]. Among these methods, liquid–liquid extraction is regarded as an economical, environmentally-friendly and efficient method to separate acetic acid from other substances and gains attention widely because of its higher capacity and easier regeneration process. Liquid-liquid extraction of carboxylic acids by suitable extractants could be a promising method[18–22]. The traditional extractants used for extraction of organic acids are divided into three major groups: organophosphorus extractants[23–26], carbon bonded oxygen-bearing extractants (alcohols, ethers, esters)[27–28] and aliphatic amine extractants[29,30]. A significant drawback of known organophosphorus extractants is their low extraction capacity, good solubility in water and their hydrolysability in acid solution[23,31]. Oxygen-bearing hydrocarbon extractants are not able to fulfill the basic requirements since their distribution ratios are quite low[32]. As for aliphatic amine extractants, primary amines and second amines yield a high mutual solubility with water and are subject to form amide with carboxylic acids at high temperature, which makes it difficult to recover both carboxylic acids and amines since amide are highly stable. In contrast, tertiary amines was very effective for the extraction of carboxylic acid, but it was difficult to strip acetic acid from extractants[33]. Recently, amide extractants are regarded as potential replacements for traditional organic extractants[34–35]. Amide extractants have many advantages, such as good hydrolysis resistance and radiolysis performance[36], but there are little research carried out on extraction of two different polar molecular. The objective of this study is using proper amide extractant to separate two polar molecular (namely, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid) efficiently, environmentally and economically. Six different amides were used to separate HAc and HCl and the influence of alkyl chain is studied. Moreover, factors that influence extraction process were studied, including temperature, dilute ratio and phase ratio. The interaction mechanism of HAc extracted by amide was investigated by combining stoichiometry, FT-IR and quantum chemical calculations. Besides, the stripping process and recycling performance were also studied."

Ltd, China. The white oil (saturated alkanes) supplied by Maoming Huanhai Fine chemical Co., Ltd was served as diluents. All the chemicals and reagents used in our experiments were analytical-grade and deionized water was used to prepare all kinds of solutions. All relevant chemicals and reagents (analytical grade purity) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. Amide extractant is synthesized by mixing different anhydride and amine[37]."
3,Extraction and stripping procedures,"2.2 Extraction and stripping procedures In this study, the raw wastewater was prepared with the concentration of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid being 0.99 mol L−1and 4.20 mol L−1 respectively based on real production process of glucosamine[5]. Extraction process was performed by putting the amide extractant and the raw wastewater in a beaker in a thermostat water bath (DF-101S, China), after which it was stirred magnetically for 2 min. Then the mixture was held for stratifying before being divided into organic phase and water phase respectively. The operation of stripping process was consistent with the extraction process. The concentration of HAc in aqueous phase was obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of HCl was measured by titration."
4,HPLC analysis,"2.3 HPLC analysis High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system Agilent 1200 series was used to obtain the HAc concentration in the aqueous phase. Agilent Technologies ZORBAX SB-Aq column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used and the detection is Diode Array Detector with wavelength 210 nm. The liquid sample (20 μL) was analyzed for 40 min[11]. A series of HAc standard solutions were prepared to obtain the linear relationship between HAc concentration and peak intensity. The acetic acid concentration was calculated by applying regression equation y = 0.2501x-0.00006602 (R2 = 0.9997), in which y is the HAc concentration (mol L−1) and x is the peak intensity."

7,Computational methods,"2.6 Computational methods The molecular structure of different amides, n-C18H37NO-HAc complexes and n-C18H37NO-HCl complexes were optimized by Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-311G* level[38]. The bond length, bond angles, dipole moment were acquired using Gaussview. The wave function was analyzed by Multiwfn 3.6[39]. The color mapped isosurface graphs of the electrostatic potential were rendered by the VMD 1.9.2[40]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of alkyl chain of amides on the extraction of acetic acid,"3.1 Effect of alkyl chain of amides on the extraction of acetic acid Six different amides were chosen to separate acetic acid and hydrochloric acid respectively. A series of extraction efficiencies, stripping efficiencies and separation factors were obtained, as is shown in the Fig. 1 . In contrast to other three types of extractants, the extraction efficiencies of n-C10H21NO, n-C14H29NO, n-C18H41NO and i-C14H29NO are within 47 ~ 60%, which are higher than that of tertiary amines (40%~ 43% for tri-n-octylamine extractant)[41–43]. As for carbon bonded oxygen-bearing extractants, the extraction efficiencies of 39%, 36%, 43% are obtained by methylisobutyl ketone, octanol and Ethyl acetate separately, which are lower than that of amides[44–45]. 47% of HAc is extracted by trioctylphosphine oxide organophosphorus extractants, which is similar to that of amides but is costly expensive[46], meaning that amide is a suitable extractant for the extraction of HAc compared with other three major groups. As for the six amides, it can be seen that the rank of the ability of acetamide containing two symmetrical alkyl branches to extract acetic acid from raw wastewater was: n-C10H21NO> n-C14H29NO> n-C18H41NO, while the rank of ability in terms of amides with a fixed length of the symmetrical branch chain was i-C13H27NO> i-C14H29NO> i-C20H41NO. As for isomers, the ability to extract acetic acid was weakened with the degree of branching of amides higher. In order to understand the influence of alkyl chain of amides on the HAc extraction deeply, hydrogen bond formed during extraction and dipole moment of amides were investigated and relevant information was shown in Table 1 . In general, the distance between H atoms and electronegative atoms, namely acceptor atom, as well as the hydrogen bonding angle are used to judge whether hydrogen bond is formed or not. From the calculation results, the bond length between carboxyl hydrogen atom from acetic acid and carbonyl oxygen atom from amides are all within 1.72 Å and 1.77 Å, which are shorter than the sum of van der Waals atomic radii of O and H (2.72 Å) but longer than covalent bond length of O − H (0.96 Å)[47]. And the bond angles formed are found to be within the criteria of the O − H···O hydrogen bond[43]. However, hydrogen bond length and bond angles of different complexes with different alkyl chains differ with each other, which illustrates that alkyl chains have an influence on extraction ability. In terms of acetamide with two symmetrical branches (n-C10H21NO, n-C14H29NO, n-C18H41NO), the bond angles are similar (ranging from 169.90° to 170.09°) and very close to 180°, which reflects the directivity of hydrogen bond. The dipole moment sees a decline and the hydrogen bond length rises with the increase of alkyl chain of acetamide, which illustrates that the hydrogen bonding interaction formed between amide and HAc and the hydrophilicity of extractant are weakened by the alkyl chain. As for amides with the length of the symmetrical branch chain fixed, namely i-C13H27NO, i-C14H29NO and i-C20H41NO, the bond angles are smaller than the other three amides, but they are still within the criteria of hydrogen bond. In terms of the effects of alkyl chain, there are similar trends among hydrogen bond length, dipole moment and alkyl chain, namely, hydrogen bonding interaction and the hydrophilicity, are weakened due to the influence of alky chain. As for isomers, the bond angle of n-C14H29NO-HAc is larger than that of i-C14H29NO-HAc, which proves that the electrostatic repulsion between n-C14H29NO and HAc is smaller than that between i-C14H29NO and HAc, indicating that the hydrogen bonding interaction might be stronger. This can also be verified by the hydrogen bond length and dipole moment. The hydrogen bond length of n-C14H29NO is shorter than that of n-C14H29NO, and the dipole moment of n-C14H29NO is higher than that of i-C14H29NO, which indicates that n-C14H29NO had more hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding interaction is stronger. As a result, the ability of n-C14H29NO to extract HAc is higher than i-C14H29NO. In conclusion, alkyl chains influence the ability to extract HAc by changing hydrogen bond strength, dipole moment and bond angles. The alkyl chains bonded with CO of amides have a greater influence than that bonded with N of amides since they are more hydrophobic. The general rule is that with the elongation of alkyl groups, the extraction efficiencies see a decline for all amide extractants while stripping efficiencies rise."
10,Double hydrogen bond coupling extraction of acetic acid,"3.2 Double hydrogen bond coupling extraction of acetic acid By balancing extraction efficiency, separation factor, stripping efficiency and stratification time, n-C10H21NO and n-C14H29NO were not selected since the stratification time was too long. i-C14H29NO and i-C20H41NO were not chosen because the extraction process was too complicated due to the low extraction efficiency. Compared with i-C13H27NO, the ability of n-C18H41NO to separate acetic acid from hydrochloric acid was higher. Thus, n-C18H41NO was chosen as the optimal extractant. 3.2.1 Effect of the extraction temperature Thermodynamics was investigated first in order to provide an insight into the effect of the extraction temperature. The distribution ratios of HAc in n-C18H41NO extractant and aqueous phase with different temperature were obtained. Enthalpy change (Δr H m) could be calculated by plotting ln D vs. 1/T according to Van't Hoff equation and following equations: (5) D = b K ex (6) lnD = ln ( b K ex ) + - Δ r H m RT where b means linear relationship between D and K ex. Fig. 2 shows that ln D is a function of 1/T (ln D = −1.56 + 813.28/T). According to the above derivation, the standard molar reaction enthalpy change was −6.76 kJ mol−1. The negative value illustrates that the HAc extraction reaction was exothermic. Therefore, the ability of extractant to extract HAc is weakened with the increase of temperature. The extraction efficiencies at 298 K and 308 K are 56% and 55% separately, which are similar to each other. As a result, 308 K is chosen as the extraction temperature for next sections since it is more controllable in the real production process. 3.2.2 Effect of the dilute and amide concentration Adding certain amount of dilute is supposed to improve the fluidity, accelerate stratification and reduce impurity entrainment (water). White oil (saturated alkanes) have the advantages of strong dispersing ability and low price; therefore they are widely used as diluents. The organic phase was made up with different volume fractions of 100%, 80% and 60% respectively. Extraction efficiency of HAc and HCl was obtained in organic phase with different concentrations of extractant, as is shown in Fig. 3 . The extraction efficiency of HAc and HCl both decrease with the proportion of white oil increased. When the percentage of n-C18H41NO is 60%, the extraction effiency of HCl by extractant decreases to about 1%, meantime the separation factors increases from 6.0 to 36.7, which means that the organic phase can separate HCl and HAc successfully. Therefore, organic phase containing 60% of extractant and 40% white oil was chosen to separate HCl and HAc. 3.2.3 Effect of the volume ratio of organic phase to aqueous phase The ratio of organic phase to aqueous phase has a significant influence on extraction efficiency. The ratio was obtained by measuring the saturation capacity of extractant. Saturation capacity was obtained by extracting many aqueous phases with one organic phase until the concentration of acid in the organic phase stayed basically unchanged. The saturation capacity was confirmed by the analysis of the concentration in the organic phase. The results of saturation capacity were shown in Fig. 4 . The concentration of HAc rises with the increase of extraction times, while the concentration in organic phase stays basically unchanged after being extracted for four times. The extraction efficiency is almost zero and the concentration of HAc reaches 0.5024 mol L-1. As a result, the ratio (2) is calculated through HAc concentration in wastewater divided by 0.5024 mol L-1. Likewise, the saturation capacity for HCl is 0.2929 mol L-1, while the theoretical ratio for extracting HCl is 15. In summary, the ratio of 2: 1 was chosen for countercurrent extraction process to extract HAc more but extract HCl as little as well. 3.2.4 Seven-stage countercurrent extraction In order to recover HAc as much as possible, countercurrent extraction process was applied with extraction stages calculated by using following empirical equation: (7) N = - 2 + lg 100 - E N - 2 + lg 100 - E 1 where N indicates the stages needed, while E N and E 1 represent extraction efficiency obtained in the desired stage and that of the first stage of countercurrent extraction. N was seven with the ratio of aqueous phase and organic phase being 2: 1 and E N being 99% since E 1 was 47.27%. Seven-stage countercurrent extraction was chosen after the concentration of HAc and HCl achieved a balance in aqueous phase and organic phase within the seven-stage countercurrent extraction process. After extraction process reaching balance, the extraction efficiency of HAc was as high as 99.70% and the acidity in each organic phase and aqueous phase stayed basically unchanged, meaning that the extraction process is highly reliable and stable (Fig. S2). The HCl product was obtained from the raffinate with the concentration being 4.00 mol L−1 (Fig. S2). The HCl purity was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. S3), and the purity is high up to 94%."
11,Double hydrogen bond coupling extraction mechanism,"3.3 Double hydrogen bond coupling extraction mechanism The interaction mechanism between HAc and n-C18H37NO is studied by applying stoichiometry of complexes, FT-IR analysis and quantum chemical calculations, based on which double hydrogen bond coupling extraction mechanism was proposed. 3.3.1 Stoichiometry of extracted complexes It is of great importance to study the determination of complexes of HAc and amide extractant. The extraction efficiencies and distribution ratios were obtained with different extractant concentration in order to provide support for the complexes structure. The reaction coefficient of extraction reaction between amide extractant and acetic acid was studied by slope method, which is deduced as follows: (8) HAc + nB ↔ HAc · nB (9) K ex θ = C HAc · n B C θ C HAc C θ · [ C B C θ ] n (10) D = C HAc · n B C HAc (11) C B = n V = ρ · w M (12) ln D = ln K e x θ + n ln ( ρ · w M · C θ ) where n was the stoichiometric number, w was the mass fraction of extractant and M was the molar mass of extractant, K e x θ was the standard equilibrium constant, D was distribution ratio of acetic acid in organic phase to aqueous phase. The stoichiometric number was the slope of the ln D - ln ρ · w M · C θ , as is shown in Fig. 5 . The relationship of lnD - l n ρ · w M · C θ can be obtained from Fig. 5, and the fitting regression equation was ln D = - 1.361 + 1.316 ln w · ρ M c θ . It can be concluded that n was 1.316, which meant the amide extractant was complexed with acetic acid in a ratio of 1: 1 in the extraction process. 3.3.2 FT-IR analysis In order to investigate the extraction mechanism, FT-IR was applied to study the association modes of complexes because different complexing modes will lead to different IR absorption peak. The FT-IR spectra of blank amide extractant, amide extractant containing HAc and HCl were studied and the peaks of characteristic peaks were listed in Table 2 . The occurrence of peak at about 3450 cm−1 in blank amide may be hydrogen bond formed between water molecules in extractant and CO from amide[48]. It is obvious from the Fig. 6 that the peak intensity at about 3450 cm−1 in amide containing HAc is stronger than that of blank amide, since the HAc concentration in amide was higher than water concentration, thus resulting that the hydrogen bond formed between hydrogen of HAc and CO of amide is stronger. It is well known that 1234 cm−1 is the C-N stretching vibration peak of tertiary amide and the characteristic peak of amide I band (νCO) occurs in 1649 cm−1 nearby[49], but the peak splits into two peaks of 1645.06 cm−1 and 1609.58 cm−1 respectively after HAc is extracted into the amide, as is shown in Fig. 6, which may be resulted by conjugate between CO of HAc and CO of amide since n-C18H41NO forms hydrogen bond with hydrogen of HAc through CO. Therefore, the complexes formed is regarded to be connected by forming hydrogen bond. The new peak at 1732 cm−1 [50] in the complexes indicates the ν(CO) of HAc, which illustrates the complexing between HAc and amide. In contrast, the main difference in amide containing HCl is that a strong and wide peak at about 3400 cm−1 appears compared with blank amide, which is similar to the ν(OH) of hydrogen bond formed between O atom of amide and H atom of HCl. Therefore, the amide might combine with HCl by forming hydrogen bond. 3.3.3 Charge distribution analysis The charge distribution was studied in order to understand the interaction sites of acids and n-C18H37NO. The calculated results are shown in Table 3 . Due to both N and O are electronegative atom and could be served as an acceptor of a hydrogen bond, it should be discussed whether hydrogen bond was formed with N1 or O21. From the calculation results, it can be concluded that N1 is electropositive atom, while O21 is an electronegative atom, which illustrates that O21 serves as the acceptor of hydrogen bond instead of N1. Besides, H59 of methyl bonded with CO is more positive than other two hydrogen atoms (H58 and H60), meaning that a different electrostatic interaction could be formed between H59 of n-C18H37NO and O3 of HAc. As for HAc, the most negative charges are around O3 and O4, while H8 is the most positive charges among all hydrogen atoms. The charge of hydrogen atom in HCl is 0.226, which is similar to the charge of H8 atom of acetic acid. In general, the calculated values of atomic charge could provide an understanding on electrostatic interaction between atoms. From the above calculated results, a strong electrostatic interaction could be formed between O21 of n-C18H37NO and H8 of acetic acid. Besides, since O3 of acetic acid is a negative charge and H59 of n-C18H37NO is a positive charge, the other strong electrostatic interaction was possible. As for HCl, a strong electrostatic interaction would be formed between O21 and H of HCl. As for the high separation factor of HAc to HCl, it can be seen that the charge value of H8 of acetic acid is lower than that of hydrochloric acid, meaning that a stronger electrostatic interaction is formed between n-C18H37NO and HAc than n-C18H37NO and HCl. What’s more, the other electrostatic interaction formed between O3 of HAc and H59 of n-C18H37NO would further strengthen the bonding interaction between n-C18H37NO and HAc, which illustrates that the ability of n-C18H37NO to extract HAc is stronger than to extract HCl. 3.3.4 Electrostatic potential analysis Apart from atomic charge distribution, electrostatic potential is a good tool to understand interaction between n-C18H37NO and acids[51–52]. In order to illustrate association mechanism, the VMD 1.9.3 program was used to plot the charge distribution map according to the molecular electrostatic potential. As for HAc (Fig. 7 a, d), the red region (high electrostatic potential) is distributed on the carboxyl hydrogen atom (H8) and methyl. The vdW surface areas (electrostatic potential values higher than 20 kcal mol−1) is 7 Å2 and account for 7.21%, which is attributed to the surface near the hydrogen atom of carboxyl group. Likewise, there is also a small proportion (12.84 Å2, 13.21%) of the vdW surface area with the values lower than −20 kcal mol−1 and these surface areas are from oxygen atoms of carboxyl group. The global maxima and minima of the electrostatic potential are 48.41 kcal mol−1 and −34.3 kcal mol−1 respectively, which corresponds with the hydrogen atom of carboxyl group and oxygen atom of carbonyl. As for HCl (Fig. 7c, f), the range of electrostatic potential values is similar to that of HAc. It can be seen that the vdW surface areas and proportion with electrostatic potential higher than 20 kcal mol−1 are 9.49 Å2 and 16.60% respectively. The maxima and the minima of electrostatic potential are 40.98 kcal mol−1 and −12.53 kcal mol−1, which are attributed to the hydrogen atom and chlorine atom. It can be inferred that a strong electrostatic interaction could be formed for both n-C18H37NO-HAc complexes and n-C18H37NO-HCl complexes due to the fact that the vdW surface areas with electrostatic potential values higher than 20 kcal mol−1 for both acids is similar. As for n-C18H37NO (Fig. 7b, e), the blue region is distributed on the carbonyl oxygen atoms (O21), with the minima of electrostatic potential being −44.24 kcal mol−1. 94.97% of the vdW surface of n-C18H37NO has a relatively low electrostatic potential value (−15 to + 15 kcal mol−1), while it should be noted that the maxima of local electrostatic potential appears on the H53 of methyl. Therefore, during the process of extraction, the electrophilic region (H8) of HAc might attack the nucleophilic region (O19) of nC18H37NO to form hydrogen bond, which is consistent with Markham (1996)[53] and Iuchi (2002)[54]. Meantime, it is also possible for O3 of HAc to interact with H58 of n-C18H37NO. Since the local electrostatic potential of O3 and vdW surface areas lower than −20 kcal mol−1 are −34.30 kcal mol−1 and 12.84 Å2, it should be enough to form the other hydrogen bond between O3 and H58. As for the interaction between nC18H37NO and HCl, likewise, hydrogen atom of HCl could interact with O19 of nC18H37NO to form a hydrogen bond. Deeper analysis would be discussed in the next part. 3.3.5 Topology analysis According to analysis of FT-IR, stoichiometry of extracted complexes, charge distribution analysis and electrostatic potential analysis, n-C18H37NO-HAc and n-C18H37NO-HCl was proposed as the complexing structures. To understand deeply about the selective separation of HAc and HCl by nC18H37NO, topology analysis based on atoms in molecules (AIM) theory[55] was used according to optimized n-C18H37NO-HAc complexes and nC18H37NO-HCl complexes to obtain more information about the intermolecular interaction between n-C18H37NO and acids. Electron density (ρ BCP), Laplacian of electron density (▽2 ρ BCP) and energy density (H BCP) at bond critical point (BCP) are considered to evaluate hydrogen bond formed during extraction. As for n-C18H37NO-HAc complexes, two different BCPs are formed between H8 and O19, H53 and O3 during extraction. ρ BCP and ▽2 ρ BCP are shown in Table 4 . As for O5H8···O19, the values of ρ BCP and ▽2 ρ BCP are 0.0418 au and 0.1330 au, which are within the criterion for hydrogen bonding interaction (ρ BCP values within 0.002–0.04 and ▽2 ρ BCP values within 0.02–0.15 au)[56]. The negative value (-0.00097 au) of H BCP for O5H8···O19 indicates that the bond has covalent character[57]. The same conclusion could be obtained for C18H53···O3. In contrast, the value of H BCP for O5H8···O19 is positive, which indicates that the hydrogen bond formed between C18H53···O3 is stronger than that formed between O5H8···O19. This can also be verified by the values of potential energy density V(rBCP), which is widely applied to illustrate the strength of the hydrogen bond. The V(rBCP) value of C18H53···O3 (-0.01108 au) is lower than that of O5H8···O19 (−0.03520 au). Therefore, double hydrogen bond coupling extraction mechanism is proposed (Fig. 8 a). Due to the electron-withdrawing effect of O atom bonded with alkyl group of amides, the charge of H bonded with C right next to the CO is positive enough to form a hydrogen bond with CO of HAc. Together with the hydrogen bond formed between CO of amides and carboxyl hydrogen atom of HAc, double hydrogen bonds are formed during extraction. As is shown in interpenetration map (Fig. 8c), double hydrogen bonds could be seen clearly. This mechanism is verified by other five amides after topology analysis is carried out. From the Table S1, it can be seen that double hydrogen bonds are formed for all the other five amides, with one strong hydrogen bond and one weak hydrogen bond. As for nC18H37NO-HCl complexes, the values of ρ BCP and ▽2 ρ BCP were 0.0431 au and 0.1347 au respectively, which are similar to the values of nC18H37NO-HAc. The negative value (-0.00056 au) of H BCP indicates the covalent character of the interaction (Fig. 8b). The formed hydrogen bond could be seen clearly from Fig. 8d. According to the V(rBCP) value (−0.03479), it can be concluded that the hydrogen bond strength (Cl1H2···O19) of n-C18H37NO-HCl complexes is slightly weaker than that (O5H8···O19) of n-C18H37NO-HAc complexes (−0.03520 au). Meanwhile, the other hydrogen bond (C18H53···O3) of nC18H37NO-HAc complexes strengthens the interaction between nC18H37NO and HAc due to the coupling effect of double hydrogen bonds, which results that the electron density is higher among bonding region. As a result, a stronger interaction is formed between n-C18H37NO-HAc complexes. The double hydrogen bond coupling effect is the key for n-C18H37NO to separate HAc and HCl successfully."
12,Stripping process and recycling of amide,"3.4 Stripping process and recycling of amide After countercurrent extraction process, the HAc concentration in the organic phase was 0.5680 mol L−1. According to the thermodynamics analysis in section 3.2.1, The stripping efficiencies at 338 K and 348 K are 48% and 47% respectively. As a result, 338 K was selected as the stripping temperature in order to reduce energy consumption. 3.4.1 Effect of phase ratio of aqueous phase to organic phase As for stripping process, the effect of phase ratio of aqueous phase to organic phase was studied first. Deionized water was used as the stripping agent, and the ratios of organic phase to aqueous phase were 1: 1, 1.5: 1, 2: 1, 2.5:1, 3:1, respectively. The influence of phase ratio on the stripping efficiency and HAc concentration in the stripping solution was studied, as is shown in Fig. 9 . With the increase of the phase ratio, the stripping efficiency of HAc gradually decreased, and the concentration of HAc in the stripping solution gradually increased. In order to keep the concentration of the stripping water as high as possible, and simplify the stripping process as much as possible, the ratio of 1.5: 1 was finally selected for countercurrent stripping, thus ensuring that HAc was stripped completely. 3.4.2 Eight-stage stripping process Since single-stage stripping process can’t strip HAc from extractant effectively (stripping efficiency 56%), eight-stage stripping process was accepted to make the stripping efficiency up to 90% according to empirical Eq. (7). After a balance was achieved in the countercurrent stripping process, the stripping efficiency stayed about 91.94%. The HAc concentration is 0.7958 mol L−1 (Table S2). The HAc product purity was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. S4). The HPLC analysis showed that a high-purity HAc was obtained (97%). 3.4.3 Recycling of amide extractant The residual acid in organic phase was removed by NaOH in order to recycle amide extractant. After being regenerated, extractant was used to extract HAc from raw wastewater with 7-stage countercurrent extraction process. After the acidity stayed unchanged, the extraction efficiency was about 99%. It can be seen that the extractant efficiency of newly synthesized amides extractant is similar to that of amide extractant regenerated in Table S3, which indicates that the amide extractant could be recycled. The process flow diagram for recovering HAc and HCl is shown in Fig. 10 . High-purity HAc product (97%) and HCl product (94%) are obtained. In the past, our research group succeeded in separating lactic acids with 100 000 tons produced annually by using centrifugal contactor separator device. The continuous dynamic separation process consumes low energy as well as the ease of scale-up benefits a lot in terms of cost and simplicity."
13,Conclusion,"In our study, applying amide as extractant to separate HAc and HCl from wastewater was reported as well as relevant process was developed. The influence of alkyl group was studied by quantum chemical calculations and experiments. The ability of amide to extract HAc is weakened with the elongation of alkyl group. Stoichiometry, FT-IT spectrum and quantum chemical calculations were carried out in order to explain the extraction mechanism and the high separation factor of HAc to HCl. The high separation factor of HAc to HCl is achieved due to the coupling interaction of two hydrogen bonds formed between HAc and n-C18H37NO-HAc. Moreover, double hydrogen bond phenomena could be observed for other five amide extractants. As a result, double hydrogen bond coupling extraction mechanism was proposed to illustrate the strengthened bonding interaction between HAc and amide. As for double hydrogen bond coupling extraction, thermodynamics study illustrates that the extraction process is exothermic (-6.76 kJ mol−1). After optimizing extraction process, stripping process and regeneration process, high up to 99% of HAc could be extracted by seven-stage countercurrent extraction process with optimized extractant (60% n-C18H37NO and 40% dilute) and a ratio of 2:1 (O/A) at 308 K, while 90% of HAc could be recovered in an eight-stage stripping process with a ratio of 1.5: 1 at 338 K. The regenerated extractant performs the same as the newly synthesized extractant. The HAc product and HCl product was obtained with high purity (97% and 94% respectively). It is believed that double hydrogen bond coupling mechanism is a promising method to separate HAc and HCl and the process is highly reliable, eco-friendly and cost-friendly to recycle HAc and HCl in the wastewater during the production of glucosamine."
