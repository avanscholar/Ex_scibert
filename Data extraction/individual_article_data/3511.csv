0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are one of the major energy resources widely used to meet our energy requirements. The discovery of new crude reserves has been steadily decreasing. Furthermore, this resource is fast being depleted. Many consider fossil-fuel combustion as the major source of global warming [1–3]. Providing an affordable, reliable, environmentally sustainable energy to the world’s population presents a major challenge for the first half of this century and beyond [4]. The utilization of various alternative sources of energy such as wind, geothermal, tidal, solar and biomass has been researched. The exploitation of renewable fuels to fulfill our energy requirements, like hydrogen, bioethanol, dimethyl ether, and biodiesel has been widely investigated to sustain the energy requirement [5–8]. One of the potential applications of biofuels is generating power using fuel cells [9,10]. Among the existing fuel cells, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are versatile fuel cells because they can accommodate various fuels due to their high-temperature operating conditions [11–13]. The use of various liquid hydrocarbons for utilization in SOFCs has been examined due to their easy storage, high hydrogen contents, and higher reactivity compared to other hydrocarbons [14,15]. Internal reforming of oxygenated fuels in SOFCs improves reforming activity and reduces the rate of carbon deposition through a favorable route to CO/CO2 [14]. Biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel obtained by transesterification of vegetable oil or animal fat with methanol and alkali as a catalyst [16]. Biodiesel has a very high flash point, making it one of the safest alternative fuels. Because biodiesel is non-toxic and biodegradable, handling and storage are safer than conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke opacity is decreased by blending petroleum diesel with biodiesel in a combustion engine [17]. Along with above mentioned advantages, stoichiometrically biodiesel can produce 35 mol of H2 per mol of biodiesel with HCR of 1.844 which strongly depends on WBFR [18]. Therefore biodiesel is a prospective feedstock for utilization in hydrogen production for fuel cell applications. Hydrogen can be produced by partial oxidation (PO), steam reforming (SR), and autothermal reforming (ATR) processes. The PO and ATR processes have the merits of fast start-up times because of the exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction. However, SR provides higher efficiency and reformates quality, i.e., a higher hydrogen yield, lower rate of side reactions and fewer by-products. This reaction is strongly endothermic, requiring a flame to heat the reactor to the reforming temperature necessary to achieve high conversion. The ATR is a combination of SR and PO reactions, with both reactions occur simultaneously. This combination is considered to be one of the most attractive options for the on-board reforming of complex hydrocarbons like kerosene and diesel [19,20]. Its main characteristics are a low energy requirement (due to the complementary SR and PO reactions), low energy consumption, high gas space velocity (HGSV; at least one order of magnitude greater than traditional SR), and a preset H2/CO ratio easily regulated by inlet reactant ratios and CO2 recycling [21]. Three fuel-processing options for the production of hydrogen from biodiesel were examined at a conceptual design level by Specchia et al. for the utilization in PEMFC’s. 1. Autothermal reformers (ATR) with high and low temperatures shift (HTS/LTS) reactors. 2. Autothermal reformer (ATR) with a single medium temperature shift (MTS) reactor. 3. Thermal cracker (TC) with high and low temperature shift (HTS/LTS) reactors with high and low temperature shift reactor. The ATR with both HTS and LTS reactors showed the most promising results; with a net electrical efficiency of 29% based on the fuel’s lower heating value (LHV). The ATR of biodiesel was carried out by Kraaij et al. [22] using a catalyst provided by Johnson-Matthey with a high gross-fuel-processor efficiency of 87% and a low CO content (below 10 ppm), providing a reformate-gas composition suitable for PEMFC use. The catalyst converted 99% of the biodiesel into hydrogen and 0.6% of the rest was methane, with the remaining 0.4% attributed to (NMHCs) in the form of C2–C5 alkenes. Ospinal-Jiménez examined the ATR of biodiesel using Pt and Rh based catalysts at 540 °C with water/carbon ratios from two to six and oxygen/carbon ratios of 0.6–1.45 in a plug-flow reactor (PFR) [23]. The rhodium-based catalyst did not shows any catalytic activity; the platinum-based catalyst produced an outlet gas with 25% hydrogen, 3% CH4, 21% CO and 38% CO2 at 485 °C and water/carbon (W/C) = 2, oxygen/carbon (O/C) = 0.5. By increasing (W/C) to 3.5, the CO2 output increased due to the water-gas shift reaction. A maximum hydrogen selectivity of 19.85% was reported with O2/C = 0.6. The use of a catalyst promoted the formation of a liquid products consisting of aromatics like hexane, toluene, benzene, and xylene (ortho, meta, and para) with a maximum of 4382 ppm of benzene. Coke formation was detected under all conditions and catalyst soot was also detected. A decrease in catalytic activity results from coke formed from aromatic hydrocarbons [24,25]. Nguyen et al. [26] examined the roles of rhodium- and rhodium-ceria-coated alumina-monolith catalysts in the catalytic PO of methyl acetate as a model component of methyl esters to better understand the conversion of biodiesel into hydrogen. The Rh catalyst demonstrated the highest methyl acetate conversion at an O/C ratio of 1.33, and the decrease in the conversion rate with increasing O/C ratio was higher than for Rh/Ce. The results obtained were different from those obtained by Specchia et al. who reported an optimum O/C ratio of 0.35 during APU simulations [18]. The ratio of 0.6 was reported by Ospinal [23]. Ramanathan et al. [27] examined the production of olefins by the PO of biodiesel. At O/C ratio =1.1, the selectivity for H2 was 85% and for CO was 80%. As the O/C ratio was decreased, the selectivity toward these species decreased rapidly as the “total hydrocarbons” (i.e., all products C2 through C15) increased. The amount of CO2 formed due to combustion reactions remained <13% for all C/O ratios. The C2 through C5 species were almost exclusively olefins and the larger species comprised both olefins and olefin esters. Ethylene dominated the small olefins, with a maximum selectivity of ∼25%, followed by propylene and smaller amounts of higher olefins. The lack of research and detailed experimental investigation of hydrogen production from biodiesel has prompted a thermodynamic analysis of the process to determine the optimum conditions to produce hydrogen. ATR has been reported as the best process to produce hydrogen, but clearly with limited success. Different optimum O/C ratios have been reported in the literature. Similarly, a hydrogen selectivity of 44% was reported by Kraaij et al. [22] and 25% by Ospinal-Jiménez [23] which is very limited for utilization in fuel cells. Similarly none of the literature reports the conditions under which carbon free reactor environment can be obtained. A thermodynamic analysis would provide a clear picture of the best operating parameters for operating a biodiesel fuelled ATR reformer. In this study, hydrogen production via the ATR of biodiesel was evaluated on a thermodynamic basis for the first time. The effect of variables such as the water-to-biodiesel molar feed ratio (WBFR) and oxygen-to-biodiesel molar feed ratio (OXBFRXBFR) on the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were examined. The formation of by-products such as alkanes and alkenes was also evaluated along with a coke-free region and the effect of inert components on the process. The possible reasons for coke formation were also discussed."
1,Modeling methodology,
2,Minimization of Gibbs free energy,"2.1 Minimization of Gibbs free energy Equilibrium compositions can be calculated in one of two ways, either by calculating the equilibrium constants or by minimizing the Gibbs free energy. One of the disadvantages of using the former is that it is more difficult to test for the presence of some condensed species in the reaction products than the latter. However, it is anticipated that solid carbon may be produced during the fuel reforming process and deactivating the catalytic reactions [28]. Therefore, a method based on minimization of free energy is normally used in fuel reforming analysis. The condition of the chemical equilibrium may be stated in terms of thermodynamic functions such as the minimization of the Gibbs or Helmholtz free energy or the maximization of entropy. Among these, minimization of the Gibbs free energy is more favorable when the reaction temperature and pressure are specified. For a mixture of n species (1 to m are for ideal gases and m + 1 to n are for condensed species), the Gibbs free energy (G) can be expressed as. (2.1.1) G = ( G , T , p , n i ) ; j = 1… m , m + 1… n (2.1.2) G = ∑ j = 1 n n i g ˙ i For reacting species in gas phase, (2.1.3) G = ∑ j = 1 n n j ( ∂ G ∂ n i ) T , P , n ≠ n i where nj denotes the number of moles of each respective component of the mixture. The molar chemical potential μj of species j is defined as: (2.1.4) μ ˙ i = ∑ j = 1 n n j ( ∂ G ∂ n i ) T , P , n ≠ n i (2.1.5) G = ∑ j = 1 n n i μ ˙ i (2.1.6) G i + ∑ j = 0 k λ j a j i = 0 (2.1.7) μ i = g i ( T , p i ) (2.1.8) g ˙ i ( T , p i ) = h i ( T ) − T s ˙ j P ( T , p i ) (2.1.9) μ ˙ i = h i ( T ) − T s ˙ j P ( T , p i ) (2.1.10) μ ˙ i = h i ( T ) − T ( s j . o − R ln ( y i p p o ) ) (2.1.11) μ ˙ i ( T , p i ) = g j . o ( T ) + R T ( ln ( n i n ) ) − R T ( ln ( p p o ) ) (2.1.12) μ ˙ i = μ i . o ( T ) + R T ( ln ( n i n ) ) − R T ( ln ( p p o ) ) (2.1.13) n = ∑ j = 1 m n i ; j = 1…. m The equilibrium state at specified T and p is determined by minimizing the Gibbs free energy and is subject to the constraints imposed by conservation of atoms. (2.1.14) b j o = ∑ j = 1 n a i j ; i = i …. l In the above equation is the number of atoms of element i in the reactants, and aij is the number of atoms of element l in species j in the products. (2.1.15) θ = G + ∑ j = 1 l λ i ( b i − b i o ) where λ i is the Lagrangian multiplier. Hence, the condition for the equilibrium becomes: (2.1.16) δ θ = ∑ j = 1 n ( μ ˙ j + ∑ i = 1 l λ i a i j ) δ n j + ∑ i = 1 l ( b i − b i o ) δ λ i = 0 Treating the variations ( δ n j ) and ( δ λ j ) as independent yields (2.1.17) μ ˙ i = G + ∑ i = 1 l λ i a i j = 0 ; j = 1… n Thus, for ideal gas, combining Equations (2.1.11) and (2.1.16) gives. (2.1.18) μ i .o R T + ( ln ( n i n ) ) + ( ln ( p p o ) ) + ∑ i = 1 l θ i a i j = 0 ; j = 1… m (2.1.19) μ i .o R T + ∑ i = 1 l θ i a i j = 0 ; j = m + 1… n (2.1.20) θ i = λ i R T For a given T and p, Equations (2.1.12), (2.1.13), (2.1.17) and (2.1.18) form a set of n + l + 1 simultaneous equations for solving the n unknown ( n i ) , (l) unknown ( δ ) and n. The thermodynamic function is then solved by the Newton–Raphson method for the unknowns."
3,Reactions of ATR of biodiesel,"2.2 Reactions of ATR of biodiesel The reactions occurring in the ATR of biodiesel is tabulated in Tables 1 and 2 . In order to maximize hydrogen production, it is crucial to ensure adequate supply of steam and oxygen and to minimize by-products like coke and methane. The present procedure was used to evaluate various gaseous species such as hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water (H2O), and elemental carbon (C) as a solid. The major products of the ATR of biodiesel are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. The performance of the system was measured in terms of yield and selectivity. The individual components of biodiesel, e.g., methyl oleate, were individually considered to form real biodiesel mixtures. (2.1.21) X e ( % ) = ( F bin − F bout ) F bin × 100 (2.1.22) Y i ( % ) = F i ( x i × F i ) × 100 where, X e is the equilibrium conversion of biodiesel, F bin and F bout are the molar flow rates of biodiesel at the inlet and outlet, respectively, Y i is the yield of either hydrogen or carbon monoxide, F i is the molar flow rate of either hydrogen or carbon monoxide at the outlet and x i is the stoichiometric yield, 35.1–35.5 for H2 and 13.97–18.91 for CO depending on the type of methyl ester, as shown in Table 3 . Generally, the definitions of catalyst selectivity are different according to the convenience of describing a catalytic reaction. In the ethanol SR reactions, the selectivity of hydrogen was usually defined as the mole ratio of hydrogen produced to the ethanol consumed [29]. The selectivity (S p) for hydrogen and other gases were defined as follows [30]: (2.1.23) S p ( % ) = mol p ∑ mol sp × 100 Where molp represents the moles of each product, and molsp represents the of sum moles of products. The thermodynamic compositions of the expanded product set for the investigation of by-products are shown in Table 4 ."
4,Results and discussion,"This section addresses the implications of producing hydrogen-rich fuel-cell feeds from the PO, SR, and ATR processes. The initial mole of biodiesel was set to 1mol. The analysis was carried out at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 300 and 800 °C at different water-to-biodiesel molar feed ratio (WBFR) from 3 to 12 and oxygen-to-biodiesel molar feed ratio (OXBFRXBFR) from 0 to 4.8. Pure oxygen was considered for the evaluation of the process. Complete conversion of biodiesel was observed in the considered range of pressure and temperature. The selectivity and yield of hydrogen was an important parameter which varied in the examined range of temperature, WBFR, and OXBFR. The simulations were performed at atmospheric pressure since previous investigations of SR of oxygenated hydrocarbons have already shown that higher pressures are thermodynamically unfavorable [33,34]. The increase in pressure shifts the equilibrium to reactants in the key hydrogen forming reactions (R-1) [35]. Carbon monoxide methanation increases with increase in pressure resulting in increased methane selectivity thereby negatively affecting hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields [36]."
5,Hydrogen and carbon monoxide formation,"3.1 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide formation Marquevich et al. reported that hydrogen production from various oils, e.g., rapeseed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and soybean were very similar. This was attributed to their very similar compositions, with oleic and linoleic being the main fatty acids in varying proportions [37]. Therefore, soybean oil methyl ester (SOME) was selected to evaluate the hydrogen production in the current study. Fig. 1 a and d shows the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide as a function of OXBFR and temperature in the PO process. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield increased with increases in temperature at constant OXBFR due to increased PO activity. Hydrogen yield reached a maximum of ∼46% at OXBFR = 0.8 at 800 °C. While carbon monoxide yield was maximized at OXBFR = 4.8 at 800 °C. At constant temperature, an increase in OXBFR negatively affected hydrogen yield, as a result of oxidation (R-19) [38], but carbon monoxide yield increased with OXBFR at constant temperature, reaching a maximum of 52.38% at 800 °C. An increase in temperature causes the oxidation of coke (R-29) to carbon monoxide thus resulting in an increase in carbon monoxide yield. The Fig. 1b and e shows the effects of WBFR and temperature on the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the SR of SOME. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields were lower at low temperatures due to the formation of methane as result of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-5) and coke (R-9). Hydrogenation or methanation of carbon monoxide (R-5) consumed almost all carbon monoxide produced at all WBFRs. With an increase in temperature at constant WBFR, the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increased as a result of an increase in the SR of methane (R-8) and the improved steam gasification of coke (R-27) [35,39,40]. At constant temperature, an increase in WBFR increased the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide due to an increase in reforming activity along with coke gasification. Marquevich et al. (2000) reported higher hydrogen yields (80%–87%) at S/C above 6 in comparison to 61% predicted in simulation. They reported that temperature had little influence on hydrogen yield in the range of 650–850 °C at these S/C ratios. Higher hydrogen yield ∼75% even at lower S/C = 3, was reported in comparison to 50% at WBFR=3 observed in simulation at 750 °C using commercial nickel((United Catalysts G90C) based catalyst at constant GHSV of 9150 h-1 [40]. Similarly nickel catalyst prepared by hydrotalcite-type (HT) precursor, with a Ni/Al atomic ratio of 2/1 exhibited 10 times higher activity in comparison to commercial catalyst. H2 production of 2.6 mol H2/h gcatalyst was observed with HT catalyst in comparison to 0.25 molH2/h gcatalyst exhibited by commercial catalysts (ICI 46-1 and UCI G90C) at 570 °C and an S/C = 6 [42]. Catalyst with lower nickel content exhibited the highest activity throughout the range of 550–650 °C and S/C ratios of 3–9. This was because of its smaller nickel crystallite size and higher BET area along with water adsorption capacity [43]. Compared to hydrogen, carbon monoxide yield increased sharply with increases in WBFR. It has been reported that an increase in WBFR causes a decrease in carbon monoxide production due to an increase in the water-gas shift reaction (R-4) [44]. This can be explained by the fact that biodiesels are complex oxygenated hydrocarbons compared to ethanol or methanol. Biodiesel has a tendency to form higher amounts of coke compared to ethanol or methanol. Therefore, increasing temperature promotes coke gasification (R-17) resulting in an increase in the yield of carbon monoxide. As carbon monoxide is utilized as fuel in SOFC fuel cells, WBFR values were chosen such that they would favor the formation of carbon monoxide over carbon dioxide. Increases in WBFR along with temperature caused an increase in the steam reformation of methane (R-8) along with coke gasification, resulting in the carbon monoxide yield reaching a maximum of ∼64% at 800 °C and WBFR = 12 [39,45]. In both the PO and SR processes the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide was considerably low at 800 °C, operating temperature of SOFCs. Therefore, the effect of ATR conditions on the yield of carbon monoxide and hydrogen was examined at 800 °C. Fig. 1c and f shows the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide under ATR conditions at 800 °C. As in SR, WBFR is the parameter which determined the hydrogen yield and the selectivity for coke in ATR. A high WBFR ratio favors the formation of hydrogen, and similar behavior has been reported in the ATR of dimethyl ether, glycerol, and methanol [46–48]. The yield obtained by ATR was considerably higher compared to that obtained by the PO process. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, the yield of hydrogen was reduced with increasing OXBFR at high WBFR and high temperature. The yield obtained in ATR was lower compared to the SR process at the same temperature. In comparison to hydrogen, ATR greatly affects the yield of carbon monoxide. The yield of carbon monoxide reached 91.66% at WBFR = 9 and OXBFR = 4.8 in ATR compared to 52.4% at OXBFR = 4.8 under PO and 63.7% at WBFR = 12 in SR at 800 °C. An increase in WBFR to 12 decreased the carbon monoxide yield to 87.82% in ATR at the same temperature as a result of the water-gas shift reaction (R-4). In general, high WBFR and high OXBFR are preferred to produce hydrogen-rich gas at 800 °C, as the primary goal of fuel reforming is to maximize the amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced. The yield is significantly affected by coke and methane selectivity; therefore, it is important to understand the general sensitivity of the process variables (i.e., temperature, WBFR, and OXBFR) on the selectivities for the products. 3.1.1 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide selectivity The selectivity for hydrogen as a function of temperature and OXBFR for WBFR values of 3, 6, 9, and 12 is depicted in Fig. 2a–d. The highest selectivity for hydrogen occurred under pure SR conditions (OXBFR = 0) which was monotonic with respect to temperature at a given WBFR and also with respect to WBFR at given temperature. The hydrogen selectivity was a weak function of OXBFR; the selectivity decreased slightly with an increase in OXBFR at all temperatures. The selectivity for hydrogen was a strong function of temperature at all OXBFRs and WBFRs. At SOFC temperature, selectivity decreased from 57.24% at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 0 under SR conditions to 54.07% at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8 in the ATR as a result of fuel oxidation(R-31). Marquevich et al. reported higher hydrogen selectivity 68.5% with ICI 46-1catalyst in SR of vegetable oil at 650 °C and S/C of 9. Changing the catalyst did not show a significant effect on the hydrogen selectivity [37]. Higher hydrogen selectivity 71.8% was reported by Shotipruk et al. in SR of distilled palm fatty acid at 900 °C with Ce–ZrO2 catalyst at with S/C = 3. In disagreement with simulations introduction of oxygen (ATR conditions) increased hydrogen selectivity up to O2/C = 0.8 and with further increase in oxygen had no effect on the selectivity in ATR of distilled palm fatty acid [49]. The increases in selectivity for hydrogen with WBFR were due to the increase in reforming activity along with improved gasification of coke (R-27). Although increases in WBFR should shift the water-gas-shift reaction equilibrium to the left, toward hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the shift in equilibrium was negligible as the selectivity for carbon dioxide over carbon monoxide was insignificant. The effects of steam dilution were considered, as excess steam was utilized in the gasification of the coke formed (R-27), but dilution effects were not observed at these WBFRs. Fig. 3a–b depicts the selectivity for carbon monoxide as a function of temperature and OXBFR for WBFRs of 3, 6, 9, and 12. Under PO conditions with WBFR = 0, carbon monoxide selectivity reached 27.89% at OXBFR = 4 and 800 °C. Oxidation to carbon dioxide (R-30) decreases carbon monoxide selectivity, with an increase of OXBFR to 4.8, but the selectivity for carbon monoxide under PO conditions was lower compared to ATR at all OXBFRs. The selectivity for carbon monoxide in a PO process has been reported to be higher than in SR and ATR of dimethyl ether [46]. Higher coke formation in the PO of biodiesel compared to dimethyl ether resulted in lower PO activity and a reduced selectivity for carbon monoxide [50]. Compared to hydrogen, carbon monoxide selectivity was lowest under SR conditions, reaching a maximum of 25.2% at WBFR = 12 at 800 °C. This could be due to the increased coke selectivity under SR conditions. Similar to hydrogen under SR conditions, carbon monoxide selectivity monotonically increased with respect to temperature at given WBFR. At constant WBFR, an increase in temperature increased carbon monoxide selectivity with OXBFR, probably due to coke oxidation (R-29) and the PO of methane (R-14). At lower temperatures (300–400 °C), the selectivity for carbon monoxide was a weak function of temperature and OXBFR at all WBFRs considered. At temperatures above 500 °C, the selectivity for carbon monoxide was a strong function of temperature and OXBFR at all WBFRs. At all temperatures examined, increasing the OXBFR from 0 to 3.2 at WBFRs from 0 to 9 (ATR conditions) increased the selectivity for carbon monoxide, which attained a maximum of 39.16% at WBFR = 9, OXBFR = 4.8 and 800 °C. Shotipruk et al. reported 51% carbon monoxide selectivity at 900 °C, O2/C = 1 and S/C = 3 with Ce–ZrO2 catalyst [49] in ATR of palm distilled fatty acids. At the higher WBFR of 12, the water-gas shift reaction (R-4) increased thereby reducing the carbon monoxide selectivity. The water-gas shift reaction (R-4) caused carbon monoxide selectivity to decrease when the WBFR was increased to 12 at OXBFRs of 4 and 4.8."
6,Production of hydrogen from various types of biodiesel,"3.2 Production of hydrogen from various types of biodiesel The ATR of soybean oil methyl esters (SOME) showed maximum yields and selectivities for both hydrogen and carbon monoxide were attained at WBFR = 9 and OXBFR = 4.8. Coke formation was completely inhibited and methane selectivity was minimized at these conditions. Soybean oil is a edible oil and an increase in prices has caused many biodiesel plants to halt production and delay the construction of new plants [51]. Like soybean oil, palm oil is also facing crises of food vs. fuel uses [52]. In order to maintain adequate supply and reduce the cost of production for effective economic application in fuel cell technology. Hydrogen production from biodiesel obtained from coconut, jatropha, mahua, lard, yellow grease, cotton seed, palm and corn etc were examined and compared with pure soybean oil. The yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from various types of biodiesels such as (a) canola oil methyl esters (CAME), (b) coconut oil methyl esters (COME), (c) corn oil methyl esters (CRME), (d) palm oil methyl esters (POME), (e) Soybean oil, and (f) SNME are shown in Fig. 4 . The transparent curve in the figure represents CO yield while solid curve represents H2 yield. The yields and selectivities for the SR and ATR products from various types of biodiesels at 800 °C, WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8 are shown in Tables 5 and 6 . Yields of hydrogen were highest in the SR process with all the types of biodiesel considered. The highest yield was obtained with COME, while the lowest was obtained with soybean oil. The relative hydrogen yields from the biodiesels examined were in the following order: COME > CRME > SOME > CAME > SNME > POME > Soybean oil. The order of carbon monoxide yields was different than for hydrogen, and was found to be: COME > Soybean oil > POME > CRME > SOME > CAME > SNME. Similar to yield, maximum hydrogen selectivity was obtained in COME while lowest in soyabean oil. Carbon monoxide selectivity was highest in soyabean oil and lowest in SNME. Marquevich et al. reported that hydrogen selectivity for rapeseed, corn, soybean, and sunflower oils were very similar, as all the differences were of the same order of magnitude as the experimental error [37]. In ATR the hydrogen yield decreased for COME and soybean oil, respectively, at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8. Yields of carbon monoxide for COME decreased in ATR compared to the SR process. The lower formation of coke and the introduction of oxygen decreased carbon monoxide produced by oxidation (R-30). The yield of carbon monoxide with CAME, CRME, POME, and SNME increased with the introduction of oxygen under ATR conditions. The difference in the orders of hydrogen production can be attributed to the use of oxygen in ATR, causing oxidation of hydrogen (R-31). The introduction of oxygen increased carbon monoxide production due to the oxidation of coke (R-30), thus changing the amount carbon monoxide produced depending on the amount of carbon formed in the SR of each type of biodiesel. The order of hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields in ATR was different to that obtained under SR conditions and are shown below: SOME > CRME > CAME > SNME > POME > Soybean oil > COME CRME > CAME > SNME > SOME > POME > Soybean oil >COME The hydrogen selectivity in ATR of edible oils was different to that seen in SR conditions. Highest selectivity was obtained in ATR of SNME while lowest was found in COME. Carbon monoxide selectivity was highest in CAME and lowest in COME. Fig. 5 represents the effect of WBFR and OXBFR at 800 °C, on the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from various biodiesel derived from nonedible and animal sources such as beef tallow methyl esters (BTME), (b) cotton seed methyl esters (CSME), (c) Jatropha oil methyl esters (JOME), (d) lard methyl esters (LME), (e) Mahua oil methyl esters (MOME), and (f) yellow grease methyl esters (YGME). The yields and selectivities for products in the SR and ATR processes from various nonedible and animal sources at 800 °C, WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8 are shown inTables 7 and 8 . The highest yield of hydrogen was observed in the SR process, similarly to the edible oils. The orders of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced in SR of nonedible oils given below: CSME > LME > YGME > BTME > MOME > JOME BTME > LME > CSME > MOME > YGME > JOME The hydrogen selectivity was highest in SR of BTME while lowest in SR of JOME. Czernik et al. reported a 74% yield with 48% selectivity yield in the SR of trap grease in a fluidized bed reactor at 800 °C, steam/carbon (S/C) ratios of 3–5, and a GHSV of 900–1200 h−1 [53]. Carbon monoxide selectivities in SR nonedible oil esters did not deviate much; SR of CSME was highest while MOME was lowest. The order of hydrogen produced under ATR conditions was similar to that obtained in SR. As with the edible-oil biodiesels, carbon monoxide produced in the ATR of non-edible oils and animal fats varied with respect to SR. The order of production is as follows: CSME > LME > YGME > MOME > BTME > JOME CSME > JOME > MOME ≫ LME > BTME > YGME Hydrogen selectivity in ATR of MOME was highest and CSME was lowest. In comparison to hydrogen, carbon monoxide selectivity was highest in BTME and lowest in JOME. The selectivity for methane in the SR of COME was the highest while methane selectivity in soybean oil was the lowest. Methane selectivities as low as 0.5% were reported by Marquevich et al. in the SR of soybean oil at 600°C over ICI 46-1 catalyst at steam/carbon = 6 [37]. Methane selectivity for soybean oil under ATR conditions was comparable to that obtained by Marquevich et al., while the selectivity for methane in the ATR of COME was lower than reported by Marquevich et al. The highest coke selectivity was observed in the SR of CAME. Soybean oil and COME exhibited very little or no coke selectivity in SR conditions. Coke formation was completely inhibited under ATR process."
7,Formation of alkanes,"3.3 Formation of alkanes By-product alkanes are formed in the SR, PO, and ATR process. The alkanes forming reactions compete with hydrogen forming reactions, resulting in lower yield and selectivity. Methane can be formed due to the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-5) or coke (R-9) and cracking of the oil. At lower temperatures, e.g., 300 °C, the formation of methane is due to hydrogenation reactions; at temperatures greater than 650 °C, the formation of methane is due to the cracking of the oil [41]. Similarly, the formation of higher alkanes like ethane has been reported in the SR of vegetable oil [37]. The formation of C1–C5 gases has been attributed to decomposition by C–C bond cleavage of both saturated and unsaturated oxygenated hydrocarbon molecules as well as long-chain hydrocarbon radicals and the undecomposed triglyceride molecule of the oil [54]. Similarly hydrogenation of carbon monoxide will also form higher alkanes(R6-8) [55]. In our evaluations, hydrogenation of carbon monoxide was considered as the contributor for alkanes. The selectivity for alkanes like ethane, propane, and butane was highest at 300 °C. Simulation results showed similar behavior. At 300 °C various reactions such as the water-gas shift reaction (R-4) were taking place along with the hydrogenation reactions. The highest alkane selectivity was observed under SR conditions at WBFR = 3. The introduction of oxygen at WBFR = 3 increased the oxidation of alkanes (R18-21) as the supplied steam was insufficient for the water-gas shift reaction (R-4). This was evidenced by an increase in carbon dioxide and water. The formation of alkanes under pyrolysis conditions WBFR = 0 and OXBFR = 0 were not examined. Increasing WBFR to six increased the water-gas shift reaction (R-4), consuming carbon monoxide and increasing hydrogen selectivity. Therefore, carbon monoxide available for the hydrogenation to alkanes was reduced, thus reducing the alkane selectivity. Similarly, higher WBFRs (9 and 12) caused dilution due to the excess steam supplied, reducing selectivity for alkanes. Increases in OXBFR at WBFR = 3 increased both the oxidation of alkanes (R18-21) and carbon dioxide selectivity. Table 9 shows the selectivity for various alkanes in the ATR of soybean oil and at 300 °C. Methane selectivity reached a maximum of 31.25% at WBFR = 3. A lower methane selectivity of 1.4% at 300 °C was reported by Idem et al. in the cracking of oil [54]. They reported a decrease in alkane selectivity with increase in temperature and steam/oil ratio. The selectivity did not increase, even with an increase in temperature to 400 °C and a steam/oil ratio of 4/1. A methane selectivity of 38.1% was observed at 550 °C in the cracking of vegetable oil [37]. This shows that the methane formed at 300 °C was the result of hydrogenation reactions. Ethane selectivity reached a maximum of 61.14% at WBFR = 6 and OXBFR = 0 and was reduced to 21.32% at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8. Propane and butane selectivities reached maxima of 58.36% and 59.20%, respectively, at WBFR = 3, decreasing to 14.75 and 10.74% at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8. Katikaneni et al. reported increase in selectivities for ethane and propane while decrease in butane selectivity with an increase in temperature to 550 °C in presence of steam [56]. The Selectivity for ethane was reduced and propane and butane selectivity increased in presence of HZSM-5 catalyst at same temperature and WHSV. The formation of alkanes with SOME was compared to the formation of alkanes with soybean oil. The selectivities for various alkanes in the ATR of soybean oil are presented in Fig. 6a–d. The selectivity for methane was slightly higher for SOME than unmodified oil, reaching 31.81% at 300 °C and WBFR = 3. As for methane, the selectivities for ethane, propane, and butane were slightly higher compared to the oil. The selectivity for methane was higher with unsaturated biodiesel compared to saturated biodiesel, as shown in Table 8. Methane selectivity increased, with an increase in the saturation of the components of biodiesel while an increased unsaturation resulted in the decrease in the selectivity for methane. Furthermore, an increase in the linoleic content of biodiesel has shown to decrease methane selectivity; see Tables 4 and 9. Although the simulations predicted higher selectivity for the higher alkanes, reports in the literature have shown that the selectivity for these alkanes, e.g., ethane, propane, and butane, is limited in the SR of vegetable oil and free fatty acids at temperatures between 550 and 900 °C [42,49]. At high temperature (900 °C), the selectivity for methane was significant, about 30.7%, in the SR of free fatty acids [49]. Hence, the effects of temperature and OXBFR on the selectivity for methane were studied at different WBFRs. As the selectivity of methane in the ATR of soybean oil and SOME were similar, the effect of variables like temperature, OXBFR, and WBFR were studied with SOME. The selectivity for methane in ATR of SOME as a function of temperature and OXBFR at WBFRs of 3, 6, 9, and 12 is shown in Fig. 7 . The highest methane selectivity was observed under SR conditions at WBFR = 3 at 300 °C due to the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-5), as shown in Fig. 6. At constant WBFR, an increase in temperature resulted in a decrease in methane selectivity as a result of methane steam reformation (R-10). Under SR conditions, increasing WBFR from 3 to 12 decreased methane selectivity at all temperatures. At lower temperatures (300–450 °C), a decrease in methane selectivity was caused due to dilution of the product stream [59]. Above 500 °C, increasing WBFR caused an increase in the SR of methane (R-10) resulting in reduced selectivity [39]. A methane selectivity of 1.73% was observed at 800 °C and WBFR = 12. The methane selectivity is a strong decreasing function of OXBFR at its lower values, from 0 to 3.2. Selectivity decreased from 1.75% at OXBFR = 0 to 1.38% at OXBFR = 3.2 at constant WBFR = 3 and 800 °C. At higher OXBFR, the decrease in selectivity was weak function of OXBFR, reducing selectivity to 1.25% at OXBFR = 4.8. Similarly to SR, in ATR the selectivity decreased with an increase in WBFR, reaching a minimum of 0.54% at OXBFR = 4.8."
8,Formation of alkenes,"3.4 Formation of alkenes Thermal cracking is a competing and unavoidable reaction during the SR of vegetable oil and biodiesel [41]. Cracking of vegetable oil begins at 250–350 °C by cleavage of the ester bonds to yield free fatty acid chains. At higher temperatures, fatty acids decompose by decarboxylation and decarbonylation to saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, liberating carbon oxides. These hydrocarbons are then further converted by ethylene elimination, isomerization, and hydrogen-transfer reactions to yield ethylene, propylene, and other small hydrocarbons [54]. The formation of ethylene propylene and butylene by the PO of SOME has been reported in the literature [27]. Ethylene dominated the small olefins, with a maximum of ∼25%, followed by propylene and smaller amounts of higher olefins. Therefore, the formation of butylene was not investigated. Ethylene (C2H4) has been reported to cause rapid coke formation in the reforming process. Yoon et al. showed that a large quantity of C2H4 was produced by the pyrolysis of heavier hydrocarbons at local fuel-rich areas in the ATR of diesel. Thereafter, in the absence of oxygen and water, C2H4 was transformed into coke through a pyrolytic process [60]. Increasing temperatures above 500 °C has been reported to increase ethylene formation, reaching 40.8% at 750 °C [37]. At high reaction temperatures, large amounts of C2–C4 olefins are obtained from the cracking of oil which can oligomerize and then aromatize to produce large amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are responsible for the deactivation of catalysts by filling the pores with polyaromatic compounds formed by gas-phase free-radical reactions [57,61]. Theses alkenes viz. ethylene propylene and butylene can also hydrogenate to ethane, propane and butane. Higher selectivity for alkenes at high temperature, 750 °C has been reported [41]. Billaud et al. reported maximum selectivity of C1–C4 olefins formed by pyrolysis of rapeseed oil methyl ester, at 850 °C with 30% ethylene selectivity [50]. This high selectivity for ethylene would greatly affect the life and activity of the catalyst. Therefore, the formation of alkenes in the ATR of SOME and soybean oil was examined at 800 °C. Alkene selectivity was greatly affected by the SR and PO processes. Under the SR process, i.e., OXBFR = 0, increasing WBFR increased the SR of alkenes (R32-33) thereby reducing alkene selectivity and increasing hydrogen and carbon monoxide selectivities. Similarly, under PO conditions, where WBFR = 0, increasing OXBFR increases the PO of alkenes (R34-35) to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Under ATR conditions at lower WBFR (WBFR = 3), in the case of propylene from oil significant amounts of carbon dioxide were seen due to the oxidation of carbon monoxide (R-30). Under ATR conditions the OXBFR selected promoted PO instead of the total oxidation of alkenes (R36-37). The selectivity for alkenes in the ATR of soybean oil and SOME is represented in Fig. 8 . The highest propylene selectivity, 57.01%, was observed in soybean oil PO at OXBFR = 0.8 (Fig. 11b). The selectivity for propylene was a strong function of OXBFR. Increasing OXBFR resulted in a decreased selectivity of 14.2% at OXBFR = 4.8 due to PO (R-34). A selectivity less than 10% at oxygen/carbon = 0.66 was reported by Subramanian et al. in the PO of SOME at 800 °C [27]. Alkene selectivities under SR and ATR conditions were considerably lower compared to PO. The lowest selectivity, 27.3%, was obtained at WBFR = 3 in SR, while the introduction of oxygen (OXBFR = 0.8) increased selectivity to 42.39% under ATR conditions. ATR is a combination of PO and SR; at lower WBFRs, PO is dominant, hence higher propylene selectivity was seen compared to SR. Although the selectivity for propylene was higher under ATR conditions, it was lower compared to the selectivity obtained under PO conditions. Idem et al. reported the formation of propylene in the catalytic cracking of canola oil. The selectivity for propylene in the gas-phase product increased with increases in both temperature and the steam/canola oil ratio. A propylene selectivity of 18% was obtained at 500 °C and steam/carbon = 1 [54]. Katikaneni et al. reported an increase in propylene formation with the introduction of steam over a silica-alumina catalyst. A selectivity of 24.1% at 450 °C and WHSV = 1.8 h−1 was reported; the selectivity increased to 36% over HZSM-5 catalyst at same operating conditions [57]. Alkene selectivity was reduced to zero at WBFR = 9 and OXBFR = 4.8. Compared to the unmodified oil, the formation of propylene was lower in the PO of SOME. Selectivity of 33.39% was observed at OXBFR = 0.8(Fig. 11d). Under SR and ATR conditions, selectivities of 18.41% and 15.31%, respectively, were obtained at WBFR = 3 and OXBFR = 0.8. The selectivity for propylene in SR of SOME was similar to that reported by Idem et al. [54]. As for propylene, ethylene selectivity with soybean oil was higher under PO conditions. Ethylene selectivity reached a maximum of 55.61% at OXBFR = 0.8 for soybean oil (Fig. 8a), and increases in OXBFR resulted in selectivity decreasing to 12.5% at OXBFR = 4.8 due to oxidation. Subramanian et al. reported a 25% ethylene selectivity at O/C = 1.19 at 800 °C on an Rh–Ce catalyst; the decreased selectivity could have been due to the presence of the catalyst [27]. Ethylene selectivities of 35.8% and 27.16% were evident in SR and ATR, respectively, at WBFR = 3 and OXBFR = 0.8. Marquevich et al. reported a 40.8% ethylene selectivity under cracking conditions at 750 °C and steam/carbon = 6 [37]. Under SR conditions the selectivity decreased below 1% with all the catalysts examined. Selectivities of 10.1% and 14.4% on silica–alumina and HZSM-5 catalysts were reported by Katikaneni et al. at 550 °C and WHSV = 1.8 h−1 in the presence of steam. Coniglio et al. reported an 18.4% ethylene selectivity in the SR of waste cooking oil at 800 °C [62]. Ethylene selectivity was decreased to zero at WBFR = 9 and OXBFR = 4.8. Unlike propylene, ethylene selectivity did not increase under ATR conditions at lower WBFRs and OXBFRs. Under PO conditions, ethylene selectivity increased slightly with SOME. A selectivity of 57.01% was observed at OXBFR = 0.8 (Fig. 8c), which was reduced to 14.20% at OXBFR = 4.8. Selectivities of 37.40% and 29.29% were seen in SR and ATR, respectively, at WBFR = 3 and OXBFR = 0.8. High WBFR (WBFR = 9 at OXBFR = 4.8) reduced the ethylene selectivity to zero."
9,Formation of coke,"3.5 Formation of coke Coke is one of the most important factors in the ATR or SR of hydrocarbons. Coke deposition has been a more challenging problem on Ni-based catalysts, especially with heavier hydrocarbons and liquid fuels that contain aromatic compounds [61,63]. The process of auto-oxidation of biodiesel is summarized as reaction initiation (by a catalyst or heat) followed by hydroperoxide (ROOH) formation involving molecular oxygen uptake and hydrogen-atom abstraction from the hydrocarbon substrate. The hydroperoxide formed decomposes to form a range of reactive radical species; polymerization via radical addition to carbon-carbon double bonds (CC) and radical side-reactions produce secondary oxidation products such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and alcohols [64]. The carboxylic acids, e.g., acetic acid, can decompose to form coke, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide [65]. Aldehydes can further produce methane and alcohols may produce alkenes like ethylene which are coke precursors [35]. Similarly, ketones like acetone are also responsible for the formation of coke [66]. In the ATR of methyl esters or oil, cracking of oil or biodiesel is a competing reaction. Aromatic hydrocarbons are formed from the thermal reaction of olefins and diolefins, aromatization reactions, and hydrogen elimination from C6 + cyclo-olefins at high temperature. At high reaction temperatures, large amounts of C2–C4 olefins are obtained from the cracking of oil, which can oligomerize and then aromatize to produce large amounts of aromatics [67]. Aromatics not only cause a lower reforming efficiency but the degradation of the catalysts in the shift reactor and the preferential oxidation reactor [68]. Biodiesel (methyl esters) can also pyrolyze to produce coke, hydrogen and monoxide [18]. During pyrolysis of the biodiesel, coke is formed from –CH2– groups of the reactant molecules; the reaction is complex and is catalyzed by nickel and iron oxides [49]. At high temperatures, lower-molecular-weight products are formed. Therefore, at high temperature, more of the lower-molecular-weight compounds such as methane ethane, and ethylene are formed at the expense of the C3+ hydrocarbons [66]. Ethylene and propylene are formed from fatty acids by ethylene elimination, isomerization, and hydrogen-transfer reactions, as discussed earlier. Ethylene and propylene are the main precursors of coke formation [37,54,60]. Coke is obtained by the following routes: 1. Decomposition of long-chain hydrocarbon radicals into its elements (carbon and hydrogen) [69]. 2. Polymerization of olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons, polycondensation of oil and heavy oxygenated hydrocarbon molecules [70]. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are the intermediates in the formation of coke from aromatic hydrocarbons. These products are formed by successive elimination of hydrogen from aromatics [54]. Extensive removal of hydrogen from polyaromatic hydrocarbons results in coke [57]. Dupain et al. reported the decomposition of triglycerides into fatty acids is governed by radical cracking reactions [71]. The relatively high number of double bonds in the fatty acids enhances the formation of aromatics. In the ATR of biodiesel, methane is formed as a result of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (R-5) and cracking reactions. At high temperatures, methane can decompose to form coke (R-23). Similarly, the reduction of carbon monoxide (R25-26) and the boudouard reaction (R-24) are also contributors to coke formation. Coke formed by various pathways can hydrogenate to methane in a hydrogen-rich environment [72,73]. The effect of methane on the formation of coke in the ATR of SOME at 300 °C was examined. Two cases were formulated to study the effect of methane. In case 1, methane was excluded from the primary product species (H2, CO, and CO2); in case 2, methane was included with the product species H2, CO and CO2. Fig. 9a–b represents coke selectivity as a function of WBFR and OXBFR at 300 °C. The highest coke selectivity was observed at WBFR = 3 and 300 °C, i.e., under SR conditions. A coke selectivity of 48.1% was observed in case 2 (Fig. 11b). Coke selectivity decreased to 45.62% in case 1 at the same conditions (Fig. 11a). Katikaneni et al. reported a 36% coke selectivity at 400 °C over a Ni–Al catalyst in the cracking of oil [70]. In the simulations, coke selectivity decreased in both cases with an increase in WBFR and OXBFR. Coke selectivities decreased to 30.70% and 39.08% in case 1 and case 2, respectively, with an increase in WBFR to 12. Under ATR conditions, coke selectivity decreased considerably compared to SR. Coke selectivities of 44.9% and 48.12% were observed in case 1 and case 2, respectively, at WBFR = 3, and OXBFR = 0.8; on increasing WBFR to 12 and OXBFR to 4.8, the selectivities reached 22.8% and 38.77%. The selectivity for coke in case 2 was higher than in case 1 under both SR and ATR conditions. Thus, the hydrogenation of coke contributed to the methane formed at 300 °C in both SR and ATR processes. Fig. 9c–e represents coke selectivity as a function of WBFR and OXBFR at temperatures of 600, 700, and 800 °C. Increases in temperature at constant WBFR did not have a significant effect on coke selectivity. Coke selectivity reached 36.31% at WBFR = 3 and 800 °C. Increasing WBFR decreased coke selectivity considerably; selectivity reached 11.93% at WBFR = 12 and 800 °C. The selectivity was still too high to achieve a coke-free environment. Compared to WBFR, increases in OXBFR tremendously decreased coke selectivity. Zero coke selectivity was obtained at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8 at 800 °C. 3.5.1 Coke free regions Fig. 10 shows the formation of coke-free regions in the ATR of SOME. To minimize the coke selectivity during the production of hydrogen from SOME, oxygen was introduced. Simulations were carried out to determine the minimum oxygen required for a coke-free environment at various WBFRs and temperatures. The coke region was the largest with WBFR = 6 at 600 °C and increases in temperature resulted in a decrease in coke regions due to improved gasification (R-27) and oxidation reactions (R28-29). Increases in WBFR also showed significant reductions in coke regions. WBFR = 9 and OXBFR = 4.8 gave the smallest coke region at 800 °C. Coke selectivity in SOME was the highest at WBFR = 3 and 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 9a. Therefore, the formation of coke from pure esters was examined as a function of OXBFR at WBFR = 3 at 300 °C. Fig. 11 represents coke selectivities in ATR for pure methyl esters at 300 °C and WBFR = 3; the yields and selectivities of the products in these trials are listed in Table 10 . The highest amount of coke formation was observed with methyl linolenate, with lowest with caprate and caprylate at OXBFR = 0, i.e., in the SR process. Coke selectivity was depressed with an increase in OXBFR, i.e., under ATR conditions. An increase in carbon number increased the formation of coke. Unsaturated methyl esters showed a higher tendency toward coke formation compared to saturated methyl esters. Increase in degree of saturation and unsaturation have shown to increase coke selectivity. Table 11 shows the yield and selectivity of products from various types of biodiesel under SR conditions at 300 °C and WBFR = 3. Fig. 12 represents coke selectivity in the ATR of various types of biodiesel. Increases in the linoleic content of the biodiesels examined, have shown to increase the selectivity for coke. The highest coke selectivity was seen in the SR of SOME (53.60% linoleic acid), as discussed earlier; COME (1.28% linoleic acid) showed the least selectivity for coke."
10,Inert-component effect,"3.6 Inert-component effect In the ATR of SOME and various types of biodiesel investigated in the preceding sections, pure oxygen was used as an oxidizing agent. However, in ATR for in situ hydrogen generation for a fuel cell, it is convenient to use air rather than pure oxygen [68]. So, it is necessary to study the effect of nitrogen on the reaction. In addition, the fuel dilution by nitrogen has been found to lower the cell electrochemical performance by decreasing the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and simultaneously increasing the concentration overpotentials. Consequently, the dilution effect is expected to further decrease the electrical efficiency of an SOFC operated directly with methane [74]. Here, nitrogen was used as the inert component and its influence under SR and ATR conditions was examined at 800 °C. Fig. 13 represents effect of NBFR (nitrogen to biodiesel molar feed ratio) and WBFR on the selectivity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide under SR (a-H2, d-CO) and ATR conditions at OXBFR = 2.4 (b-H2, e-CO) and OXBFR = 4.8 (c-H2, f-CO). Introduction of nitrogen had minor effects on the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Increasing NBFR slightly increased hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields by shifting the equilibrium to products [35]. Hydrogen yield increased from 68.81% to 69.89%, while carbon monoxide yield increased from 91.66% to 92.78% with the introduction of nitrogen (NBFR = 10, WBFR = 9, and OXBFR = 4.8; data not shown). The effect of nitrogen on the selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide would be greater than for the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, as increasing the nitrogen content would dilute the outlet composition of the ATR reformer, affecting selectivity. At constant WBFR in SR, increasing NBFR decreased the selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide from 46.70% and 10.98%, respectively, at NBFR = 0 to 39.39% and 9.36% at NBFR = 10, both at WBFR = 3. Increasing WBFR resulted in an increase in the selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide, as discussed earlier. Hydrogen selectivity decreased from 57.24% to 47.68% at NBFR = 0 and NBFR = 10 respectively at a constant WBFR = 12. Unlike for hydrogen, carbon monoxide selectivity was not appreciably affected by NBFR. Carbon monoxide selectivity decreased from 25.73% at NBFR = 0 to 21.68% at NBFR = 10 respectively at constant WBFR = 12. At constant NBFR, increasing OXBFR did not decrease hydrogen selectivity appreciably. For example, at WBFR = 3 and NBFR = 2, increasing OXBFR from 2.4 to 4.8 decreased hydrogen selectivity from 46.27% to 45.96%. Carbon monoxide selectivity increased from 21.11% to 31.02% at same conditions, similarly to ATR without nitrogen. Increasing NBFR to 10 at constant WBFR = 3 and OXBFR = 4.8 decreased hydrogen selectivity by ˜ 10%, i.e., selectivity decreased from 48.9% at NBFR = 0 to 38.80% at NBFR = 10. Carbon monoxide selectivity increased by ˜4.5%. On increasing WBFR at constant NBFR and OXBFR, an increase in hydrogen selectivity was seen at all WBFRs. Carbon monoxide selectivity increased with increasing WBFR up to 9 and with further increases carbon monoxide selectivity decreased. A hydrogen selectivity of 44.89% and a carbon monoxide selectivity of 32.09% were observed at WBFR = 12 and WBFR = 9 respectively, at NBFR = 10 and OXBFR = 4.8 under the ATR process. The effect of nitrogen on coke selectivity was examined under SR conditions investigated, as shown in Fig. 12f. At constant WBFR = 3 and NBFR = 0 coke selectivity reached a maximum as discussed earlier. Increasing NBFR from 0 to 2 caused a decreases coke selectivity by 1.9133% and 0.835% at OXBFR = 0 and OXBFR = 4.8 respectively. Furthermore, an increase in NBFR to 10 decreased coke selectivity to 7.77% and 3.377% at OXBFR = 0 and OXBFR = 4.8 respectively. Increasing WBFR to 12 at NBFR = 10 decreased carbon selectivity to 9.53%, compared to 11.935% at NBFR = 0."
11,Conclusions,"A thermodynamic analysis of the production of a hydrogen-rich gas from biodiesel for application in solid-oxide fuel cells was carried out using a Gibbs-free-energy-minimization method. The Lagrange undetermined multiplier method was used to calculate the equilibrium compositions. This study focused on the thermodynamic aspects of generating hydrogen-rich fuel-cell feeds from the combined processes of methyl ester SR and PO, i.e., by ATR. The performance of the process was measured in terms of the yields and selectivities of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The operating conditions for the production of hydrogen by the ATR of biodiesel were optimized with the complete conversion of fuel. The effects of the operational parameters temperature, WBFR, OXBFR, and NBFR on the yields and selectivities of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were examined. Hydrogen production from various types of methyl esters, e.g., corn, coconut, palm, etc., was evaluated. The formation of by-products such as alkanes, alkenes, and coke were examined under ATR conditions. The selectivity for alkanes and alkenes from biodiesel was compared to pure oils. Further, the effect of methane formation on coke selectivity at lower temperatures (300 °C) was examined. The formation of coke from pure oil and various types of biodiesel was also studied. The results led to the following conclusions: • The best conditions to operate a biodiesel fuelled ATR reformer are WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4 at 800 °C (SOFC temperature). At these conditions hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields of ∼76.8% and 91.6% with 57% and 36.78% selectivities respectively were obtained. Further at these conditions coke selectivity is inhibited and offering a coke free operation. Similarly formation of coke forming, alkenes like ethylene is inhibited at this temperature. Methane selectivity is also minimized at these conditions. • The maximum hydrogen yield and selectivity occurred under SR conditions (i.e., OXBFR = 0) while carbon monoxide yield was maximized in ATR conditions (i.e., OXBFR = 4.8) and WBFR = 12 at 800 °C. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production increased with increasing WBFR at all temperatures and reached ∼76.9 and 63.7% respectively at 800 °C and WBFR = 12. • The introduction of oxygen as a reactant (i.e., ATR), decreased hydrogen selectivity below that in SR. In contrast to hydrogen, carbon monoxide selectivity with the introduction of oxygen (i.e., ATR), increased above the selectivity obtained in SR. • Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production at a given WBFR and OXBFR was invariant in the temperature range considered. At a given WBFR, an increase in OXBFR decreased hydrogen selectivity; a maximum hydrogen selectivity of 57.24% was obtained at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 0 at 800 °C. At a given WBFR, an increase in OXBFR increased carbon monoxide selectivity; a 39.2% carbon monoxide selectivity was reached at WBFR = 12 and OXBFR = 4.8 at 800 °C. • The highest selectivities for alkanes and alkenes were observed under SR and PO conditions, respectively. SOME and soybean oil exhibited similar selectivities for methane, ethane, and propane. The selectivities for ethylene with SOME and soybean oil were similar, but higher propylene selectivity was exhibited in soybean oil. At the optimized conditions, i.e., WBFR ≥ 9 and OXBFR = 4.8, SOFC temperature (800 °C) and atmospheric pressure, only CH4 and C can thermodynamically coexist with H2, H2O, CO, and CO2, while C2H4, C3H6, C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10 are suppressed essentially to zero. • Under SR conditions, COME and CSME produced the highest amounts of hydrogen, while COME and BTME produced the maximum carbon monoxide. SOME and CSME produced the maximum amounts of hydrogen in the ATR process, while carbon monoxide production reached maxima in the ATR of CAME and CSME. Hydrogen production can be increased by transesterification of oils, i.e., hydrogen production by the ATR of SOME was higher than for soybean oil. • An increase in saturation of the esters increased methane selectivity, while an increase in unsaturation resulted in a decrease in the selectivity for methane. Coke selectivity increased with increase in degree of saturation and unsaturation of esters. An increase in carbon number increased the formation of coke, as did an increase in the linoleic content of a biodiesel. • The introduction of a nitrogen component did not appreciably affect yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide but significantly affected the selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide; coke selectivity was also slightly affected by nitrogen."
