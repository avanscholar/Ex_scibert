0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the prototype alternatives renewable energy to fossil fuels. Hydrogen can be produced by many methods among that biological method by dark fermentation and photo fermentation is more popular. This method is environmentally friendly and capable to utilize the organic waste to eliminate the pollution [1]. Dark fermentation has various advantages, for example, high rate of bacterial growth, requires low energy input, no oxygen limitation problems and low costs [2,3]. Various types of waste materials can be used as substrate for biohydrogen production such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) [4], starch-based materials [5], lignocellulosic materials [6], food wastes [7], dairy wastes [8] and glycerol waste [9]. Palm oil mill wastes are abundant and their quantities depend on palm oil production process. The demand for palm oil in the world increased at an average rate of 7.36% per year during 2006–2010 [10]. In Thailand, palm oil production was 1.35 × 106 tons in 2010 [10] and this generated palm oil mill effluent (POME) of about 5.87 × 106 m3, according to data for the Thai palm oil industry [11]. In addition, POME has been reported to have high potential for hydrogen production [4,12]. The production of hydrogen not only utilizes wastewater as substrate but also as a treatment method before discharging to environment. Mixed culture is more appropriate for hydrogen production from non-sterilized organic wastes under mesophilic temperatures at 20–40 °C [7,8,13] or thermophilic conditions at 50–60 °C [14–16]. Thermophilic operation may be suitable to meet legislation for treatment of feedstock containing pathogens. Additionally, thermophilic hydrogen production process was more efficient than the mesophilic one in both hydrogen production rate and yield. However, energy input was needed for operating thermophilic condition. Hence, thermotolerant microbe is more attractive for hydrogen production since it requires less energy input than thermophile and only limited studies were reported. It is the aim of this study to investigate the feasibility of hydrogen production from POME using thermotolerant consortia. Three major factors, initial pH, nutrient composition and temperature were optimized using non-sterile POME. The corresponding microbial communities were also analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Anaerobic seed sludge and inoculums preparation,"2.1 Anaerobic seed sludge and inoculums preparation Seed sludge was taken from anaerobic covered lagoon for biogas production from palm oil mill at Taksin Palm (1971) Co., Ltd, Surat Thani Province, Thailand. The sample temperature was 42 °C when measured on-site. Prior to use as inoculum, the seed sludge sample was pretreated with heat-shock pretreatment at 90–95 °C for 30 min."
3,Palm oil mill effluent (POME),"2.2 Palm oil mill effluent (POME) POME was collected from Trang Palm Oil Co., Ltd, Trang Province, Thailand. It had the following characteristics; brown color, pH 4.57, chemical oxygen demand (COD) 56.3 g/L, total solids (TS) 49.5 g/L, volatile solids (VS) 39.9 g/L, ash 9.6 g/L, total nitrogen (TN) 1.33 g/L, total phosphorus (TP) 0.22 g/L and total iron (Fe) 0.14 g/L."
4,Effect of heat treatment on seed sludge and initial pH on hydrogen production,"2.3 Effect of heat treatment on seed sludge and initial pH on hydrogen production The heat-treated and untreated seed sludge were used as inoculums. The batch experiments were carried out in 25 mL serum bottles with a working volume to head space of three-fifths (15 mL working volume and 10 mL head space). The solution contained 1.5 mL inoculums and 13.5 mL non-sterile POME, then the initial pH was adjusted to 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5. All batches were flushed with nitrogen gas and incubated for 48 h at 45 °C to obtain the thermotolerant consortia. At the end of cultivation, the cultured broth was measured for pH, then centrifuged (5720 g for 10 min), the supernatant was determined for their soluble metabolite. The treatment which gave the maximum hydrogen production without methane content in the biogas was selected for optimization studies."
5,Effect of nutrients on hydrogen production using response surface methodology (RSM),"2.4 Effect of nutrients on hydrogen production using response surface methodology (RSM) RSM with factorial central composite design (CCD) using the software package Design Expert Version 5.0 was used for nutrients optimization. The effect of three parameters selected based on the previous report [4]; H2NCONH2 (urea), Na2HPO4 and FeSO4·7H2O were employed as independent variables with the range of 0–0.4 g/L, 0–0.8 g/L and 0–0.6 g/L, respectively. The experiment was designed by using the software consisted of 20 serum bottles including the control. Twenty serum bottles were incubated at 45 °C for 24 h. The variable, X i, was coded as x i according to equation (1) such that X 0 corresponded to the central value: (1) x i = ( X i − X 0 ) / Δ X i , where x i is the coded value of an independent variable X i, X i is the actual value of an independent variable, X 0 is the actual value of an independent variable at the center point and ΔX i, is the step change of variable. A confirmation experiment was carried out in the same size serum bottles. Quadratic model was used to express the hydrogen production as a function of independent variables: (2) Y i = β 0 + β 1 X 1 + β 2 X 2 + β 3 X 3 + β 12 X 1 X 2 + β 13 X 1 X 3 + β 23 X 2 X 3 + β 11 X 1 2 + β 22 X 2 2 + β 33 X 3 2 where Y i is predicted response; X 1, X 2 and X 3 the parameters; β 0 the offset term; β 1, β 2 and β 3 the linear coefficients; β 11, β 22 and β 33 the squared coefficients; and β 12, β 23 and β 13 the interaction coefficients."
6,Effect of temperature on hydrogen production,"2.5 Effect of temperature on hydrogen production The treated seed sludge of 3.6 mL (10%) was inoculated into a 60 mL serum bottle containing 32.4 mL POME. Each bottle was flushed with nitrogen gas to provide anaerobic condition and capped with a rubber stopper before incubation at various temperatures. The batch tests were conducted at 25, 37, 45 and 55 °C. Gas sample was taken at time intervals for determination of total biogas and hydrogen content until biogas production stopped. At the end of fermentation process, the culture broth was measured for pH and COD concentrations. After centrifugation (5720 g for 10 min), the supernatant was determined for the soluble metabolites."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods Hydrogen content of the biogas was determined using an Oldham MX 2100 gas detector (Cambridge Sensotec Ltd., England). Methane content was analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu 8A, Japan) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Operating temperature was set at 100 °C for injector and detector with argon as carrier gas. Porapak Q column with ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene polymer was used. Soluble metabolites, ethanol (EtOH), butanol (BuOH), and volatile fatty acids (VFA) includingacetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr) and butyric acid (HBu) were analyzed by a gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard, HP 6890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Innowax capillary column packed with polyethylene glycol (HP 19091N–133E) was used. The temperature of the injection port and detector were 240 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The oven was performed using the following program: (i) 70 °C for 2.5 min, (ii) 70–100 °C with a ramping of 40 °C/min and hold at 100 °C for 0.2 min, (iii) 100–200 °C with a ramping of 10 °C/min and hold at 200 °C for 2 min. Helium was used for carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL/min. TS, VS, Fe and pH were determined in accordance with the procedures described in the Standard Methods [17]. COD, TN and TP concentrations were analyzed using commercial test kits from Spectroquant (Merck Co., Ltd., Germany)."
8,Microbial community,"2.7 Microbial community The microbial community of thermotolerant consortia was studied using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The samples were collected from seed sludge of all temperatures. Total genomic DNA of samples was extracted using soil E.Z.N.A.™ Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Omega bio-tek Inc., USA). Amplification of the first and the second PCR were described by Hniman et al. [18]. For the first PCR, the region of 16S rDNA was amplified using a universal primer set including the forward primer 27f (5′-GAGTTTGATCCTTGGCTCAG-3′) and the reverse primer 1492r (5′-GAAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3′). For the second PCR, DGGE analysis was amplified using the forward primer; L340GCf with a GC-clamp at the 5′ end (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and the reverse primer; K517r (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) [19]. The DGGE analysis from the second PCR product was performed by electrophoresis. In order to completely fuse the PCR product to the gel, the electrophoresis was carried out at 20 V for 20 min. Then the electrophoresis was adjusted to 130 V for 7 h with 8% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels and a denaturant gradient of 30–70% in 1× TAE buffer at a constant temperature of 60 °C. DGGE gels were stained with Sybr-Gold for 30 min and then the bands in the gel were excised. The excised bands were re-amplified with the second primer without GC-clamp. After re-amplification, PCR products were purified and sequenced by the Pacific Science sequencing facility (Pacific Science Co., Ltd., Thailand). Closest matches for partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were carried out with the BLAST server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of heat-treated seed sludge and initial pH on hydrogen production,"3.1 Effect of heat-treated seed sludge and initial pH on hydrogen production Effect of the initial pH (4.5–6.5) on production of hydrogen and inactivation of methanogen from POME was investigated using untreated and heat-treated seed sludge (Fig. 1 ). The amounts of hydrogen gas were dependent on the initial pH with very low hydrogen production (1.5–2.7 mL/L-POME) at the initial pH of 5.0 and none at the initial pH 4.5. The weak acid might negatively affect its hydrogenase activity as well as metabolism pathway [20,21]. The initial pH of 5.5–6.5 of heat-treated and untreated inoculum gave high hydrogen production (598–794 mL/L-POME) with the highest value from the initial pH of 6.5 using untreated inoculum. However, different optimal initial pH was reported. For example, low initial pH at 4.5 was the most effective for hydrogen production from rice slurry using anaerobic digester sludge of municipal wastewater treatment plant [13]. High initial pH at 9.0 was optimal for hydrogen production from the synthetic medium using digester sludge as an inoculum [22]. Although the untreated inoculums at the initial pH 6.5 gave the highest hydrogen production, it also generated methane (data not shown). It was reported that some methanogens could grow at pH 5.6–6.2 while most methanogen could produce methane between pH range from 6 to 8 [23]. No methane was detected in biogas at all initial pH values in batch fermentation using the heat-treated seed sludge. This indicated that heat-shock treatment could inhibit methanogenic bacteria [14]. In addition, the hydrogen production by using the heat-treated sludge at the initial pH 6.0 was slightly higher than that at pH 6.5. Therefore, the heat-treated seed sludge and the initial pH 5.5 to 6.5 were compared to select the optimum condition. Data on the cumulative hydrogen production at the initial pH 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5 were fitted to the kinetic model with modified Gompertz equation to select the best initial pH and suitable time for producing hydrogen. The equation could estimate the values of various parameters including cumulative hydrogen production, maximum hydrogen production rate and lag phase at each initial pH experiment (Table 1 ). The maximum cumulative hydrogen production (702.52 mL/L-POME) and maximum hydrogen production rate (74.54 mL/L/h) were obtained at the initial pH 6.0 with the shortest lag phase (8.3 h). The optimum pH at 6.0 from this study was the same as previous reports [24,25]. The final pH value in the effluent decreased to the pH range of 4.88–5.18 which was inversely corresponded with the increase of VFA. HAc and HBu were the main VFA constituents (35.07–44 mM and 36.77–43.44 mM, respectively) found in the effluent while small amount of HPr (0–1.62 mM) was detected. The main alcohol product in the effluent was EtOH (21.57–32.07 mM) while BuOH was not detected. Results clearly indicated that the initial pH adjustment to the optimum value at 6.0 and heat-shock treated seed sludge were necessary in order to obtain high hydrogen production without methane generation. Therefore, this optimal condition was selected for the optimization studies."
11,Optimization for hydrogen production using RSM,"3.2 Optimization for hydrogen production using RSM CCD experiment was designed to optimize the concentrations of urea, Na2HPO4 and FeSO4·7H2O to maximize the hydrogen production and determined the potential interaction (Table 2 ). The hydrogen production ranged from 501 to 988 mL/L-POME and the maximum value was observed in trial 20 with intermediate values of the three variables. Low hydrogen production of 501 mL/L-POME was obtained from trial 3 with addition only Na2HPO4. The results indicated that high concentration of Na2HPO4 and FeSO4·7H2O (trials 3, 5 and 7) did not improve hydrogen production, neither high urea nor Na2HPO4 (trials 2, 3, and 4). The data from Table 2 were fitted to a regression using the following quadratic equation: (3) H 2 production ( mL / L ) = 645.52 + 1724.02 X 1 − 685.13 X 2 + 1608.86 X 3 − 4304.24 X 1 2 + 672.01 X 2 2 − 2848.85 X 3 2 + 78.08 X 1 X 2 + 777.09 X 1 X 3 + 131.57 X 2 X 3 The results of an ANOVA tested used to identify terms in this equation (3) with the regression coefficients of R 2 = 0.97 suggested the high significance of the model. The P-value in this experiment was very low (<0.0001), indicating the model terms were significant. Additionally, lack of fit model was not significant with P = 0.41. A high precision and reliability of this study was observed from C.V. value of 4.67%. The response surface plots and the corresponding contour curves described by the regression equation are shown in Fig. 2 . The results showed that urea and FeSO4·7H2O concentration had significant interactive influence on hydrogen production, but Na2HPO4 had no interactive effect. However, urea, FeSO4·7H2O and Na2HPO4 concentration had an individual significant influence on hydrogen production. The significance of each coefficient was determined by P-values. The significance as P-value less than 0.05 were found in linear term of urea (X 1), Na2HPO4 (X 2), FeSO4·7H2O (X 3), square term (X 3 2) of FeSO4·7H2O and quadratic terms (X 1 X 3) of urea and FeSO4·7H2O. These results demonstrated that urea Na2HPO4 and FeSO4·7H2O were required by hydrogen-producing bacteria to maximize hydrogen production. Optimization on nitrogen, phosphorus and iron sources for hydrogen production from POME using Thermoanaerobacterium-rich sludge was previously reported [4]."
12,Confirmation experiment,"3.3 Confirmation experiment To confirm the validation of the statistical experiments, three replicates of batch tests were conducted under the optimal conditions. The outcome from CCD indicated that in the presence of 0.25 g urea/L, 0.02 g Na2HPO4/L and 0.36 g FeSO4·7H2O/L, the hydrogen production of 1075 mL/L-POME was predicted. Validation experiment showed that the hydrogen production was 968 mL/L-POME. The deviation between the predicted and the result obtained (observed value) was 9.95% for hydrogen production. The improvement in hydrogen production greater than 1.6 fold as compared with the control (605 mL/L-POME) was achieved. However, the hydrogen production depends on the source of seed sludge, the characteristic of the substrate and cultivation condition. For example, O-Thong et al. [4] demonstrated that the operation at high temperature (60 °C) and high COD (75.2–96.3 g/L) in POME was more appropriated for hydrogen production (6330 mL/L-POME) than that obtained from this study (968 mL/L-POME). At the end of cultivation, the major metabolites were HAc (25.02 mM), HBu (23.49 mM) and EtOH (19.76 mM) with a small amount of HPr. The hydrogen content under the optimum condition (31%) was 10% higher than that of the control (21%) or increased by 1.5 fold. Besides improvement on the hydrogen production, COD removal was also increased from 30 to 37%."
13,Effect of temperature on hydrogen production,"3.4 Effect of temperature on hydrogen production Effect of temperature on hydrogen production was investigated at fixed optimum nutrient concentrations (0.25 g urea/L, 0.02 g Na2HPO4/L and 0.36 g FeSO4·7H2O/L) with the initial pH of 6.0. Time course on hydrogen production at 25, 37, 45 and 55 °C indicated that the hydrogen fermentation reached the stationary phase at 75, 63, 53 and 53 h, respectively (Fig. 3 ). Effect of temperature on hydrogen production was estimated using the modified Gompertz equation (Table 3 ). The R 2 of all temperatures were higher than 0.99 indicating that the results were highly precise. The maximum hydrogen production (985.3 mL/L-POME) was obtained at 55 °C, followed by at 37 °C and 45 °C (948.29 and 939.96 mL/L-POME, respectively). At 25 °C, hydrogen production (706.42 mL/L-POME) and the production rate (22.52 mL/L/h) were lowest while its lag phase was longest. The maximum hydrogen production rate (75.99 mL/L/h) was achieved at 45 °C, followed by at 55 °C and 37 °C (49.34 and 41.91 mL/L/h, respectively). The lag phase was shortest (8.12 h) at 45 °C but not significantly different from that at 55 °C. The maximum hydrogen yields (27.09 mL/g COD) was at 37 °C, followed by 45 °C (26.86 mL/g COD); 55 °C (26.63 mL/g COD); and 25 °C (22.08 mL/g COD). The maximum hydrogen production from the consortia in this study at 55 °C was about 2.5 and 4 folds higher than those obtained from cow waste slurry at 60 °C (392 mL/L-slurry) and 75 °C (248 mL/L-slurry), respectively [26]. In addition, fermentation at 50 °C was found to give a higher hydrogen yield (57 mL/g VS) than at 35 °C (39 mL/g VS) [16]. At the end of hydrogen fermentation process, the final pH in all treatments dropped due to the formation of soluble metabolites mainly VFA. These consisted of HBu, HAc and EtOH in all cases (Table 3). HBu (40.05–44.94 mM) was the major component of VFA followed by HAc (30.05–41.49 mM) and EtOH (17.00–22.19 mM), respectively. Low amounts of HPr (1.54–4.08 mM) were detected at every temperature. Butyrate (0.37–0.67 mM/mM glucose) and acetate (0.34–0.42 mM/mM glucose) were also the main VFAs from glucose fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum M121, Clostridium butyricum ATCC19398, Clostridium tyrobutyricum FYa102, and Clostridium beijerinckii L9 [27]. Lactic acid was not detected at all temperatures tested. The fermentation process of POME resulted in the depletion of organic matter with 32–37% removal efficiencies."
14,Microbial community,"3.5 Microbial community Bacterial communities of hydrogen fermentation under mesophilic (25 °C and 37 °C), moderately thermophilic (45 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) conditions were demonstrated on DGGE profile (Fig. 4 ). Results of the sequence affiliation in each band on DGGE are summarized in Table 4 . The samples at each log phase were taken from the incubation time at 48, 30, 18 and 18 h and the incubation temperature at 25, 37, 45 and 55 °C, respectively. A phylogenetic tree from the DGGE profile of all temperatures is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The results from characteristics of 16S rDNA fragments of 12 bands could be divided into three groups. These were: Clostridium spp. (band 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12); Weissella sp. (band 3); and Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (band 7). Clostridium spp. was dominant species at all incubation temperatures which cover 75, 89, 71 and 83% at 25, 37, 45 and 55 °C, respectively (Fig. 4). The affiliates of genus Clostridium are identified as the major species for evolving hydrogen during dark fermentation [28]. In addition, the dominant culture of Clostridia can be easily obtained by the heat treatment of biological sludge [29]. A high hydrogen yield was obtained at an incubation temperature of 37 °C. The microbial diversity comprised of: Clostridium paraputrificum; Weissella soli; C. butyricum; Clostridium hydrogeniformans; C. beijerinckii; and Clostridium spp. An incubation temperature at 45 °C gave the maximum hydrogen production rate and its microbial community comprised of: C. paraputrificum; W. soli; C. butyricum; Clostridium thermopalmarium; Clostridium baratii; and Clostridium sp. The lowest hydrogen yield, hydrogen production, hydrogen production rate and microbial diversity were obtained at 25 °C and comprised of: C. paraputrificum; Clostridium bovipellis; W. soli; and C. tyrobutyricum. The highest hydrogen production was obtained at 55 °C and consisted of C. paraputrificum, C. butyricum, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, C. baratii and Clostridium spp. C. paraputrificum (band 1) was found to be the only one dominant bacterium represented at all temperatures. C. paraputrificum M-21 was previously reported as a hydrogen producer that was capable of solubilizing and fermenting not only chitinous material but also starch wastes including cellulosic materials [30]. C. bovipellis (band 2) is a mesophilic bacteria as it appeared at 25 °C and 37 °C only, not at 45 °C or 55 °C. However, this strain has not been reported as a hydrogen producer. C. hydrogeniformans (band 8) and C. beijerinckii (band 10) were found only at 37 °C which might enhance hydrogen yield and hydrogen production. C. beijerinckii L9 was reported to give a higher hydrogen yield (2.81 mmol/mmol-glucose) than C. acetobutylicum M121, C. butyricum ATCC19398, and C. tyrobutyricum FYa102 [27]. Moreover, C. beijerinckii PS-3, isolated from fermented oil palm sap, gave the maximum hydrogen yield of 140.9 mL/g total sugar and a cumulative hydrogen production of 1973 mL/L-oil palm sap [6]. Recently, C. hydrogeniformans was reported to grow at 15–40 °C, with a pH in the range 5.0–10.0, and capable of fermenting cellobiose, fructose, galactose (weak), glucose, maltose and salicin [31]. C. thermopalmarium (band 6) was obtained at 45 °C and 55 °C which could be considered as moderately thermophilic hydrogen producer. This strain could also be isolated from palm wine with the optimum growth temperature at 55 °C [32]. In addition, the strain was found to ferment sugars to butyric acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Since C. thermopalmarium is a non-cellulolytic, hydrogen-producing bacterium, hydrogen production could be improved by co-culture with cellulose-hydrolyzing Clostridium thermocellum [33]. Among all hydrogen-producing species from the DGGE profile, T. thermosaccharolyticum (band 7) could be detected only at 55 °C, indicating thermophilic bacteria. T. thermosaccharolyticum is always found to be dominant in microbial communities of a thermophilic condition. It is capable of degrading complex carbohydrates such as starch and cellulosic materials along with the hydrogen emission [34]. Band 3 was affiliated with the lactic acid-producer, W. soli, which is normally found in soil. The bacterium was obtained at the temperatures 25–45 °C, not at 55 °C. The presence of a lactic acid-producer normally causes lower hydrogen production. W. soli can be inhibited by controlling the temperature at about 55 °C since the strain was not observed at this temperature in the DGGE results."
15,Conclusions,"The initial pH of 6.0 and using heat-treated seed sludge as an inoculum gave the maximum hydrogen production (702 mL/L-POME) and production rate (74.5 mL/L/h). Nutrients optimization by RSM gave the optimum value at 0.25 g urea/L, 0.02 g Na2HPO4/L and 0.36 g FeSO4·7H2O/L. At the optimum condition, hydrogen production of 1075 mL/L-POME was predicted and 968 mL/L-POME was obtained from the validation experiment. The maximum hydrogen yield (27.09 mL/g COD) was obtained under mesophilic condition (37 °C). The highest hydrogen production (985.3 mL/L-POME) was achieved at thermophilic temperature (55 °C) while the maximum production rate (75.99 mL/L/h) was detected under thermotolerant condition (45 °C). Microbial community studies revealed that Clostridium spp. was the dominant species and C. paraputrificum was present at all temperatures tested, indicating its thermotolerant properties. Therefore, both initial pH and nutrient optimization factors could improve the hydrogen production from POME under mesophilic through to thermophilic conditions in correspondence with the microbial community."
