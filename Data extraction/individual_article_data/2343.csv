0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels have played an important role in the development of modern industry processes throughout the past century [1]. However, the depletion of crude oil due to increased consumption as well as the implementation of more stringent environmental regulations during recent years has led to a renewed interest in seeking out environmentally friendly alternative fuels and additives. Under these circumstances, the so-called Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) process has now become a promising solution for the synthesis of alternative liquid fuels from syngas derived from coal, natural gas, or renewable biomass. In addition to the hydrocarbons produce as the main product of the F–T reaction, by-products [2,3] such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, and other oxygenated chemicals are also produced. Out of these potential by-products, the higher alcohols (C1–C5) have a wide range of applications, including use as oxygenates for fuels, fuel additives, or intermediates for value-added chemical products such as medicines, cosmetics, lubricants, detergents, and polyesters [4]. Hence, higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) through the F–T process has become an active subject of research in the area of alternative clear fuel production [5]. Till now, various types of catalysts have been reported for use in HAS from syngas, such as alkali promoted Cu/ZnO [6–9], Cu-modified F–T catalysts [10–13], Rh-based catalysts [14,15], and Mo-based catalysts [16,17]. Among those catalytic systems available for HAS reaction, Cu-based catalysts containing active metal towards F–T synthesis (Fe, Co, or Ni), such as Cu–Fe based catalysts, are considered very promising catalysts [18,19]. According to previous studies [12,19,20], the synergistic effect between Cu and F–T elements plays an important role in HAS reactions because the production of C2+ alcohols requires a dual active site. Cu could be acting to facilitate the dissociative chemisorption of H2 and the associative adsorption of CO, while F–T elements could induce the dissociative adsorption of CO as well as hydrogenation. Many researchers have reported Cu–Fe based catalysts with relatively good catalytic performances through adding additives or loading active components onto supports [11,12,21]. However, the structure of these catalysts was usually amorphous or very complicated, making it difficult to elucidate the relationship between the catalytic structure and the performance of the reaction. Therefore, it would be highly useful to construct a model catalyst with regular structure in order to study the synergistic effects among the active components. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) materials have gained wide interest for use as heterogeneous catalysts or supports due to their versatility in chemical composition and structural architecture. The Cu-containing LDHs materials have been shown to possess highly dispersed Cu ions [22,23], which implies a significant synergistic effect between Cu and Fe. In addition, the layered structure of the catalysts was retained after calcination [22]. Using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, Grey et al. [24] further verified that the layered nature of LDHs created a homogeneous and regular structure, and also reduced negative impacts on synergistic effects through inhibiting the sintering of Cu at higher temperatures [25,26]. Moreover, the topotactic transformation of LDHs materials to metal oxides or metal–metal oxide composites could be of great significance for multi-metal catalysts. Therefore, the regular structure and the special physical chemical properties of the LDHs materials make them appropriate for use in orderto study the synergistic effects between Cu and Fe in the HAS process. Herein, in this paper we designed and synthetized Cu–Fe based catalysts derived from LDHs precursors for use in the hydrogenation of CO to higher alcohols. Through the use of different characterization techniques such as N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and H2 temperature program reduction (H2-TPR), we are able to discuss the influence of the Fe/Cu molar ratio on the LDHs structure, the relationships between the physical–chemical properties of the catalysts, and the catalytic performances of as-prepared catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Highly dispersed Cu–Fe based CFx (x refers to the molar ratio of Fe/Cu: x =0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.8, 1) catalysts were prepared according to the reported method [22] with some modifications. In a typical procedure, 1.21g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 0.505g (0.707g, 1.01g, 1.616g, 2.02g) Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 12.8gMg(NO3)2·6H2O, and 5g Al(NO3)3·9H2O [For CF1 catalyst, n(Cu2++Mg2+)/n(Fe3++Al3+)=3] were dissolved in 400mL deionized water, referred to as solution A. Solution B was the mixture of 0.25mol/L K2CO3 and 0.8mol/L KOH. Solutions A and B were simultaneously added into a glass reactor under vigorous stirring at room temperature and a pH value of 9.5. The slurry was then aged at 120°C for 20h, filtered, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and finally dried at 80°C for 12h. The samples with layered double structure were identified as CFx-LDH (x =0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.8, 1). These CFx-LDH precursors were then calcined at 350°C in stationary air for 3h and the obtained catalysts were identified as CFx (x =0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.8, 1). Certain amounts of the catalysts were reduced in a flow of syngas (H2/CO ratio of 2:1, 40mLmin−1) under atmospheric pressure at 573K for 8h. Then they were moved into a container full of fluid wax to protect the catalysts from oxygen and waited for further characterizations. Typically, catalysts CF0 without Fe was prepared following the same procedure described above as comparison."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The specific surface areas and pore volumes of the samples were detected using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Micromeritics ASAP-2000). The bulk structures of the samples were measured by XRD (Rigaku D/max-RA, Cu Kα radiation, λ =1.542Å). The morphologies of the samples were obtained using TEM (JEM-2010 FEF, 200kV). XPS data were recorded on a Thermo VGESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer at a pressure of 2×10−9 Pa using an Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source. H2-TPR was carried out in a quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. 0.03g of the sample was loaded into the center of a reactor tube which had been purged with N2 gas at 473K for 1h. Then a reductive gas (5% H2/Ar) was introduced into the tube at a flow rate of 30mLmin−1. The temperature of the reactor was increased linearly from 373 to 1273K with a ramping speed of 10Kmin−1 using a temperature-programmed controller."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation 1.0mL samples (40–60mesh) diluted with an equivalent amount of quartz granules were evaluated in a pressured fixed-bed reactor at 533K, 4.0MPa, and GHSV of 5000h−1 with a H2/CO ratio of 2:1. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were reduced in situ in a flow of syngas (H2/CO ratio of 2:1, 40mLmin−1) under atmospheric pressure at 573K for 8h. Data was taken at steady-state after 24h on-stream. The effluent gases were analyzed using a Carbosieve-packed column with a TCD and an Al2O3 column with a flame ionization detector (FID). Propake-Q columns with TCD and FID were applied for the analysis of water, methanol, and other alcohol products in the collected liquids."
5,Results and discussion,
6,N2-adsorption,"3.1 N2-adsorption Fig. 1 presents the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of CFx (x =0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.8, 1) samples, which are type IV isotherms according to the IUPAC classification. The H3-type hysteresis loop (P/P0 >0.4) demonstrates that there are large amounts of slit-shaped pore channels formed due to the aggregation of plate-like layers. The BET surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume of these CFx catalysts (as calculated from the adsorption isotherms) are summarized in Table 1 . The calculated surface area of CF0.2 is 110.7m2/g, and increases continuously to 131.7m2/g for CF0.35, before reaching its highest point at 135.0m2/g for CF0.5. The increase of BET surface areas could be attributed to the dispersion effect of the increased Fe content [26,27] on the Cu species. However, after further increasing the Fe/Cu ratio, the calculated surface area of the sample is reduced to 99.0m2/g (for CF0.8), with the smallest (62.3m2/g) obtained over CF1 catalyst. This effect could be attributed to the decline of orderliness of layered double hydroxide crystallite when there is a larger Fe component. This could also be explained by Jahn–Teller distortion which brings about the poor long range ordering [28]. Trends measured for the change in pore diameter and pore volume for different Fe/Cu ratios of the samples are similar to those changes observed for the BET surface area (see Table 1)."
7,X-ray diffraction,"3.2 X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of as-prepared CFx(x =0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.8, 1)-LDH hydrotalcites are shown in Fig. 2 . Sharp and symmetrical reflection peaks at 11.5, 23.2, 34.6, 38.9, 46.3, 60.4, and 61.8 are observed in the precursors of these catalysts, which are assigned to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110), and (113) diffractions observed in well-crystallized LDHs (JCPDS 41-1428). No other peaks due to Cu or Fe containing oxides are found in the curves, indicating that the Mg2+ and Al3+ ions in the brucite-like layers have been replaced by Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions [22]. Moreover, it is also observed that the intensity of the (003) peak declines with increasing Fe content. This effect could be due to the structural destruction and decline of orderliness of layered double hydroxide crystallite associated with the increase of Fe content, in accordance with the N2 adsorption–desorption results. The XRD patterns of CFx catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 a. The broad peaks at ∼13° are attributed to the remaining layered structure in the catalysts. The broad peaks at ∼36° and ∼60° are attributed to the presence of MgO after calcination. Apparently, after calcination the characteristic lamellar structure of the Mg–Al hydrotalcite still remains in all of the samples, revealing slight collapses of the framework. Upon comparison of the XRD patterns seen for the CFx catalysts and for their precursors (see Figs. 2 and 3), it can be seen that the remaining diffraction peak (003) shifts to a higher degree than that of the corresponding LDHs precursors. This is due to the partial loss of carbonate and water in the interlayer of the LDHs during calcination, as reported elsewhere [22]. From inspection of the enlarged profile of the ∼13° diffraction patterns of the catalysts in Fig. 3b, it can be seen that the diffraction degree of (003) experiences regular change with respect to the Fe/Cu molar ratio. Compared to (the other samples) the corresponding LDHs precursors, the (003) peak of CF0.5 changed less than the other four samples. Based on Braggs law: 2dsin θ = nλ, it is understood that there is a negative relationship between the degree of diffraction for the remaining (003) peak and the distance between layers. This result means that the CF0.5 catalyst has the largest spacing between layers, consistent with the N2 adsorption–desorption results. Moreover, after calcination, none of the five calcinated catalysts are found to contain any apparent diffraction peaks due to separated Cu-containing oxide or Fe-containing oxide species. This means that the Cu or Fe oxides are highly dispersed over the layered double structured Mg–Al hydrotalcite and also that the layered structure might inhibit the sintering of the supported metal oxides [22,23,29]. The XRD patterns of CFx catalysts after reduction at 573K for 8h are showed in Fig. 3c. In the paper reported earlier [22], it is found that the relative angle of (003) shifted to higher position with increasing reduction temperature. Therefor the broad peaks at ∼18° should be the remaining layered structure in the catalysts. It is clear that CF0.5 catalyst exhibits the strongest diffraction peak of remaining (003) crystal plane, indicating more layered structure in CF0.5 than the other four catalysts. It is also noticed that compare to the XRD pattern of calcined samples (see Fig. 3), the remaining diffraction peak (003) shifts to a higher degree. This may due to the further collapse of layered structure in the reduction process. Similar as the XRD results after calcination, neither Cu nor Fe species are found in the XRD result of reduced catalysts, revealing the highly dispersion of active components due to the layered structure of LDHs."
8,TEM,"3.3 TEM Fig. 4 shows TEM images of the CFx catalysts. All of the catalysts exhibit plate-like morphologies comprised of layered platelets standing up and lying down. Fig. 4f–j presents the cross-sections of layered platelets in the CFx samples. From these results it is possible to observe the layered structure of hydrotalcites implied by the above XRD results. No Cu or Fe oxide particles are observed in the TEM images, further indicating that the metal oxides are highly dispersed over the obtained samples."
9,Surface chemistry,"3.4 Surface chemistry In order to investigate the surface chemistry of the catalysts and clarify the synergistic effects between Cu and Fe, XPS of Cu 2p and Fe 2p spectra with fitting curves are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The quantitative analysis of the Cu 2p and Fe 2p signals for the CFx catalysts are listed in Tables 2 and 3 . The Cu 2p spectra recorded for the samples with various Fe contents are shown in Fig. 5a. According to early reports by Li and Lenglet [30,31], it is possible to distinguish between tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Cu2+ cations. In this study, CuA 2+ ions located at octahedron are referred to CuO species, and the CuB 2+ ions located at tetrahedron are referred to Cu2+ in spinel, such as CuFe2O4 or CuAl2O4. The results show that the CuA 2+ cations in the CuO are the sintered Cu ions and the other Cu2+ observed are highly dispersed Cu ions. From the quantitative analysis of Cu 2p, the percentage of Cu2+ ions that are CuB 2+ ions increases initially from 62.69% (for CF0.2) to 87.1% (for CF0.5) in correlation with the increase of Fe content, and then decreases to 64.91% (for CF1). The CF0.5 sample possesses the highest dispersion of Cu oxide, in agreement with the BET and XRD results. The Fe 2p spectra recorded for samples with various Fe substitution ratios are shown in Fig. 5b. Results also confirm the coexistence of two species of Fe [31]. Similar as the Cu2+ ions, FeA 3+ ions are referred as Fe2O3 species and the FeB 3+ ions are referred as Fe3+ in spinel, such as CuFe2O4 or MgFe2O4. However, as opposed to the variation patterns of the CuB 2+ contents (Fig. 6 a), the FeB 3+ contents of sample CF1 is higher than sample CF0.8 (Fig. 6b). The reason may be due to the fact that increases in Fe content contribute to the formation of MgFe2O4 [32]. Moreover, considering the increase of Fe/Cu molar ratio result in the crystallite of LDHs to decrease which could be observed from the XRD result showed in Fig. 2, the disorderedtransformation of FeB 3+ could be caused by the increase of amorphous phase in the catalysts precursor. For the catalysts reduced by syngas at 573K for 8h, the satellite peak completely disappears and the Cu 2p3/2 peaks shifts to ∼932.9eV (Fig. 5c). As is known Cu0 cannot be distinguished from Cu+ by the Cu2p XPS spectra, thus Cu LMM Auger spectra was performed to further clarify the copper species. According to the Cu LMM spectra showed in Fig. 5d, Cu and Cu+ all exist [33], the peak with a kinetic energy of 918eV is attributed to metallic copper, while the peak at 916.3eV is assigned to Cu+. From the above analysis it is clear that of the five catalysts, CF0.5 exhibits the highest content of tetrahedrally coordinated Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions, revealing that this arrangement offers the highest possibility of contact between Cu and Fe. As for the binding energies of Cu2+ and Fe3+, tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated metal ions show similar shift pattern. As shown in Table 2, the five CFx catalysts clearly all show lower binding energies of Cu than in CF0 sample, indicating the synergistic effect between copper and iron in the five catalysts. Moreover, according to Tables 2 and 3, the CF0.5 sample exhibits the lowest Cu binding energy and the highest Fe binding energy. These results clearly suggest that among the five catalysts, the CF0.5 sample exhibits the strongest synergistic effects between Cu and Fe [11]."
10,Reductive behaviors of the catalysts,"3.5 Reductive behaviors of the catalysts In order to provide further insight into the synergistic effects of Cu and Fe, H2-TPR measurements of the samples were performed. Fig. 7 a shows the TPR profiles of the five catalysts, where two reduction processes are observed in the low (500–650K) and high (>650K) temperature ranges. For sample CF1, the first shoulder peak (522K) corresponds to the reduction of CuO to metallic Cu, while the subsequent strong peak (578K) is attributed to the reduction of CuFe2O4 or CuAl2O4 to metallic Cu and Fe3O4 [34] or Al2O3. For the other four samples, the strong reduction peak in the low temperature range is ascribed to the reduction of CuFe2O4 or CuAl2O4 to metallic Cu. The peaks observed in the high temperature range for all of the samples could be due to the continuous reduction of Fe oxides to metallic Fe via a FeO intermediate. The differences observed between sample CF1 and the other samples may be due to the excess Fe content, which contributes to the collapse of layered structure and subsequently leads to sintering of CuO to bigger particles [22]. This observation is supported by the BET and XPS results. As is shown in Fig. 7b, the reduction temperature of the main peak for the five catalysts increases from 586K (for CF0.2) to the highest temperature recorded, 607K (for CF0.5) in correlation with the increase of Fe content. With the further introduction of Fe content, the reduction temperature decreases to 578K (forCF1). As has been observed, the synergistic effect between Fe and Cu acts to increase the reduction temperature of the Cu oxides [26,34] as well as facilitate the reduction of Fe oxides due to the hydrogen spillover effect of the Cu atoms [35,36]. The fact that the highest reduction temperature recorded for the Cu oxides was observed for sample CF0.5 further indicates its strongest synergistic effect between Cu and Fe, in accordance with the XPS measurements."
11,HAS performances of the catalysts,"3.6 HAS performances of the catalysts The catalytic performances of the CFx catalysts towards CO hydrogenation were examined under the following reaction conditions: 4.0MPa, 533K, GHSV of 5000h−1, and n(H2)/n(CO)=2.0. The CO conversion, selectivity towards total alcohols, hydrocarbons, and CO2, and the product ratio of alcohols/hydrocarbons as well as the alcohol distribution are presented in Table 4 . The results show that the alcohol selectivity increases with increase in Fe content until it reaches a maximum of 20.77% for CF0.5, before decreasing with the further addition of Fe content. Based on the results, sample CF0.2 shows very high CO2 selectivity (72.88%) and very low alcohol selectivity (2.91%). This result implies that CF0.2 possesses high water–gas-shift (WGS) activity. This finding is consistent with reported results [38–40] that CuAl or CuMgAl catalysts could be active catalysts for the WGS reaction. However, the CO2 selectivity of the other four catalysts is relatively low and is most likely due to the fact that higher Fe content works to suppress WGS activity in the catalysts through the formation of Cu–Fe dual active site. Also, as illustrated in Table 4, except for CF0.2 which exhibits a relatively high CO conversion due to the high WGS activity over the catalyst, it can be seen that the overall conversion of CO increases with increase in Fe content. To eliminate the effects of the WGS reaction on the alcohol selectivity of the catalysts, the product ratio of alcohols/hydrocarbons is calculated from the selectivity of alcohols and hydrocarbons, and represents the capacity of catalysts to produce alcohols (Table 4). It is seen that the introduction of Fe can initially increase the product ratio of alcohols/hydrocarbons, with the highest product ratio of alcohols/hydrocarbons obtained over CF0.5. However, upon a further increase of Fe content, the product ratio decreases and the very low alcohols/hydrocarbons ratio of 0.15 is observed for CF1. The production of higher alcohols requires the synergistic effect of both homogeneously dispersed Fe and Cu species. The relatively smaller amount of Fe species in the CF0.2 catalyst certainly decreases the possibility of contact between Cu and Fe, and thus decreases the formation of the Cu–Fe dual active sites [41] necessary for higher alcohol synthesis. However, too many Fe species (CF1) also negatively affects alcohol production by resulting in the destruction of layered structure and sintering of Cu, in effect also decreasing the possibility of contact between Cu and Fe. The distribution of alcohols/hydrocarbons product ratios reveals that the strongest Cu–Fe synergistic effect, in other words the highest possibility of contact between active components in samples, is for sample CF0.5, in accordance with the XPS and TPR results. However, it should be also noticed that the synergisticeffect regarding product selectivity (ROH/CHn) ratio may be biased because of the different conversion levels at the same temperature. In the case of alcohol distribution, selectivity for C2+ alcohol is of special interest. As illustrated in Table 4 and Fig. 8 , with an increase in the Fe/Cu molar ratios, the C2+ alcohols selectivity increases from 34.66% (for CF0.2) and 39.21% (for CF0.35) to the highest 48.06% (for CF0.5). This is mostly likely due to the introduction of Fe content contributing to an increased possibility of contact between Cu and Fe. This addition of Fe also results in the formation of Cu–Fe dual active sites and an increase in the ability for chain growth in the catalysts. As the relative amount of Fe increases within an appropriate range, the chain growth ability of the catalysts can be promoted in order to increase the selectivity for C2+ alcohols. However, when even more Fe is added, the C2+ alcohols selectivity decreases from 44.77% (for CF0.8) to 41.14% (for CF1). The associated chain-lengthening probabilities of the catalysts listed in Fig. 8 also show the similar variation trend. The reason for this behavior may be attributed to the structural destruction of LDHs that leads to the sintering of CuO [42] and thus a lower possibility of contact between Cu and Fe. This effect is disadvantageous to both the chain growth ability and C2+ alcohols selectivity of the catalyst. Given the above characterizations and the catalytic results measured, it is noteworthy that similar shift patterns among the physical–chemical properties as well as similar catalytic results of the catalysts are found upon the introduction of Fe content into the Cu based catalysts. The relationships between the Fe/Cu molar ratio and the BET surface area, alcohols/hydrocarbons product ratio, and C2+ alcohol selectivity for all samples are shown in Fig. 9 a. These curves all show a similar volcano trend variation pattern. Moreover, many other volcano curves are found when plotting the Fe/Cu molar ratios and other physical–chemical properties of the five catalysts, such as the temperature of Cu reduction, the amount of Cu2+ located in spinel form, the binding energies of Cu2+ and Fe3+, pore diameter, pore volume and so on. The fact that an increase in Fe content leads to similar variations for the physical–chemical properties examined indicates that there must be intrinsic associations among these physical -chemical properties. It is clear that variation of the Fe content directly causes the shifts observed in the physical–chemical properties tested, some of which may be the essential factors for the trends seen in the catalytic performances of the CFx catalysts. In other words, the catalytic performance of the catalysts could be measured by the degrees of some of the physical–chemical properties, such as the contents of tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ions or the temperature of Cu species reduction. As seen in Fig. 9b, it is clear that the varying of the alcohols/hydrocarbons product ratio nearly have the same trends as changes in the reduction temperature of Cu, indicating that harder reduced Cu species existing in the catalysts may lead to higher total alcohol selectivity. As is discussed in Fig. 7, stronger synergistic effects would increase the temperature of Cu reduction. It is also noted that the temperature of Cu reduction may be affected by the tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ion content. Tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ions are Cu ions which have strong interactions with other metal ions such as Al or Fe ions, as discussed earlier in Section 3.4. These strong interactions may result in the increased Cu reduction temperatures. The relationship between the alcohols/hydrocarbons selection ratio and the tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ion contents is shown in Fig. 9c. Perfectly linear relationship (Adj. R 2 =0.9878) is seen in the plot, indicating that the presence of more tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ions than octahedrally coordinated Cu ions in the catalysts may lead to higher total alcohol selectivity. This means that the tetrahedrally coordinated Cu species are most likely the precursors for the formation of the main active site for CO insertion during the process of C2+ alcohol synthesis. Moreover, the relationship between the alcohols/hydrocarbons product ratios and the degree of diffraction for the remaining (003) peaks is shown in Fig. 9d. Linear relationship is also found (Adj. R 2 =0.9488), indicating that as the 2θ value of the remaining (003) peak shifts to a higher degree, higher total alcohols selectivity is observed. Based on the negative relationship between the diffraction degree and the distance between layers, as discussed in Section 3.2, it is possible to examine the relationships between alcohols/hydrocarbons ratios and the spacing of the layers in the CFx samples. The activity and selectivity of the HAS catalysts are clearly dependent on their layered structures. Results show that larger distances between layers have a positive influence on the HAS process. For example, when the pore size of the catalysts become larger, carbon growth becomes easier [43], propagation of the primary product is more effective, and therefore the alcohol selectivity becomes higher in general, and so as to the C2+ alcohol selectivity."
12,Conclusion,"Highly dispersed Cu–Fe based catalysts have been successfully synthesized via thermal decomposition of layered double hydroxides precursors. XRD and TEM images have shown that Cu and Fe species were highly dispersed after calcination. The Fe/Cu molar ratio has a significant influence on the physical–chemical and catalytic properties of the prepared catalysts for the process of CO hydrogenation to higher alcohols. Upon increase of the Fe/Cu molar ratio, the tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ion content, the reduction temperature of Cu, and the spacing of layers of the as prepared catalysts exhibit a similar volcano trend as their alcohols/hydrocarbons product ratio. Results show that the alcohols/hydrocarbons product ratios have a perfectly liner relationship with the tetrahedrally coordinated Cu ion contents, indicating that it is most likely the main active site for the CO insertion process. It is also found that a higher reduction temperature of Cu species as well as larger spacing between layers is favorable for the synthesis of alcohols. Finally, the catalysts with Fe/Cu molar ratio of 0.5 show relatively high alcohol selectivity (20.77%) and C2+ alcohol selectivity (48.06%) compared to the other catalysts."
