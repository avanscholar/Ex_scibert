0,Introduction,"Steam reforming reactions have attracted much attention in producing hydrogen for residential reformers in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [1,2]. Various hydrocarbons and alcohols including methane [3–7], propane [8,9], butane [10,11], methanol [12,13], and ethanol [14,15] have been utilized as a hydrogen source in the steam reforming reaction in order to meet the flexible market demand. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has also served as an alternate source for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. LNG infrastructure may become more widespread in near future, which will make LNG well suited as a hydrogen source for residential fuel cell applications. Although ruthenium- and rhodium-based catalysts exhibit a superior catalytic performance compared to other transition metal-based catalysts, nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in the commercial steam reforming processes due to their low cost and relatively high intrinsic activity [16–18]. However, it is well known that conventional nickel-based catalysts suffer from severe catalyst deactivation in the steam reforming reactions due to the carbon deposition and nickel sintering [17–20]. Many efforts have been made to increase the stability of nickel-based catalysts in the steam reforming reactions [21–25]. It has been reported that addition of small amount of barrier or thermal stabilizer suppresses the carbon deposition and nickel sintering in the nickel-based catalysts [21–23]. However, decrease of catalytic reforming activity is inevitable when these second metals are added into nickel-based catalysts. Therefore, developing an efficient nickel-based catalyst with high activity and long durability is still required for hydrogen production by steam reforming reactions. Modification of surface and textural properties of nickel-based catalysts has been widely attempted to achieve high catalytic performance in the reforming reactions [24–27]. Especially, it has been previously reported that well-developed mesoporosity and finely dispersed nickel species in the mesoporous nickel–alumina catalyst prohibited the carbon deposition and nickel sintering during the reforming reactions [26,27]. In this respect, mesoporous nickel–alumina catalysts have attracted much attention in order to improve both activity and stability. It is known that aerogel-based catalysts can enhance the dispersion of active metal and internal mass transfer due to their superior surface area, well-developed porosity, and large pore diameter compared to xerogel-based catalysts [27–29]. Therefore, aerogel-based catalysts have been utilized in various catalytic reactions [29,30]. To our best knowledge, however, application of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst to low temperature steam reforming reaction has not been systematically examined yet. In this work, a mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst was prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method. For comparison, a nickel catalyst supported on mesoporous alumina aerogel was prepared by an impregnation method. The prepared catalysts were applied to hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG. The effect of preparation method of supported nickel catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst,"2.1 Preparation of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst A mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst was prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method, according to the similar method reported in literatures [26,27,30,31]. Fig. 1 shows the schematic procedure for the preparation of mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst. A known amount of aluminum precursor (aluminum sec-butoxide, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol at 80 °C with vigorous stirring. Small amounts of distilled water and nitric acid, which had been diluted with ethanol, were slowly added into the solution of aluminum precursor for partial hydrolysis of aluminum precursor. After maintaining the resulting solution at 80 °C for a few minutes, a clear sol was obtained. The sol was cooled to 60 °C, and a known amount of nickel precursor (nickel acetate tetrahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was then slowly added into the sol to obtain a nickel–alumina composite sol. After cooling the nickel–alumina composite sol to room temperature, a monolithic gel was obtained by adding an appropriate amount of water diluted with ethanol into the sol. The gel was aged for 7 days, and then it was dried at 50 °C and 170 atm for 10 h in a stream of supercritical CO2. The resulting powder was finally calcined at 700 °C for 5 h to yield the mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst. The prepared nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst was denoted as NiAE-SS. For use as a support, a mesoporous alumina aerogel (denoted as AE) was also prepared by a sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method without using nickel precursor, according to the similar method described above [26,27,30,31]. A nickel catalyst supported on mesoporous alumina aerogel was then prepared by impregnating a known amount of nickel precursor (nickel nitrate hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) onto AE. The prepared catalyst was denoted as Ni/AE-IP. The nickel loading in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts was fixed at 20 wt%."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of support and catalysts were obtained with an ASAP-2010 (Micromeritics) instrument. Crystalline phases of support and catalysts were investigated by XRD (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) measurements using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. In order to examine the interaction between nickel species and alumina, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a conventional flow system with a moisture trap connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of hydrogen (2 ml/min) and nitrogen (20 ml/min) was used for 0.1 g of catalyst sample. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area of the catalysts. Prior to the chemisorption measurements, 50 mg of each catalyst was reduced with a mixed stream of hydrogen (2.5 ml/min) and argon (47.5 ml/min) at 700 °C for 3 h, and subsequently, it was purged with pure argon (50 ml/min) for 15 min at 700 °C. The sample was then cooled to 50 °C under a flow of argon (50 ml/min). The amount of hydrogen uptake was measured by periodically injecting diluted hydrogen (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) into the reduced catalyst using an on-line sampling valve. Nickel dispersion and nickel surface area were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface nickel atom and that cross-sectional area of atomic nickel is 6.49 × 10−20 m2/Ni-atom. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (JEM-2000EXII, Jeol) were conducted to examine the nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts and to see the carbon deposition and nickel sintering on the used catalysts. Carbon deposition in the used catalysts was determined by CHNS elemental analyses (CHNS 932, Leco)."
4,Steam reforming of LNG,"2.3 Steam reforming of LNG Steam reforming of LNG was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the catalytic reaction, each catalyst (100 mg) was reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (3 ml/min) and N2 (30 ml/min) at 700 °C for 3 h. Feed composition was fixed at CH4:C2H6:H2O:N2 = 4.6:0.4:10:30. Total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was maintained at 27,000 ml/h g. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). LNG conversion and hydrogen yield were calculated according to the following equations on the basis of carbon balance. (1) LNG conversion ( % ) = ( 1 − F CH 4 , out + F C 2 H 6 , out F CH 4 , in + F C 2 H 6 , in ) × 100 (2) Hydrogen yield ( % ) = F H 2 , out 2 × F CH 4 , in + 3 × F C 2 H 6 , in × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical property of catalysts,"3.1 Physical property of catalysts Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of support (AE) and catalysts (Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS). All the samples clearly showed IV-type isotherms with H2-type hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of well-developed mesoporous structure [32–34]. Detailed physical properties of support (AE) and catalysts (Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS) are summarized in Table 1 . All the samples exhibited high surface area, large volume, and substantially large pore diameter, representing successful preparation of aerogel materials in this work. It is interesting to note that Ni/AE-IP catalyst exhibited lower surface area, smaller pore volume, and smaller average pore diameter than NiAE-SS catalyst, even though nickel loading in both catalysts was identical. This is because mesopores of AE support were significantly blocked by the nickel species during the impregnation process, in good agreement with the previous results [27,35]. On the other hand, textural properties of NiAE-SS catalyst were comparable to those of bare alumina aerogel support (AE). This can be understood by the fact that acetate groups in the nickel precursor controlled the hydrolysis and condensation reaction of aluminum precursor as chelating ligands during preparation of NiAE-SS catalyst, resulting in the formation of Ni–O–Al composite structure [26,36]. The above results suggest that textural properties of supported nickel catalysts were strongly affected by the preparation method."
7,Crystalline structure of calcined catalysts,"3.2 Crystalline structure of calcined catalysts Crystalline phases of calcined support (AE) and catalysts (Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS) were examined by XRD measurements as shown in Fig. 3 . It is noticeable that AE support exhibited poor crystallinity even after the high temperature calcination process (700 °C for 5 h). In other words, AE support was in the transition state between amorphous alumina and γ-Al2O3. Considering the fact that alumina phase is transformed from boehmite (AlOOH) to γ-Al2O3 at temperature above 500 °C [37,38], it is likely that hydroxyl-rich surface and well-developed mesoporosity of AE support significantly retarded the dehydroxylation and sintering of alumina. It is interesting to note that no characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to bulk nickel oxide were observed in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts. Instead, both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts exhibited three distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.6°, 44.5°, and 64.7°, indicative of nickel aluminate phase (solid lines in Fig. 3). A close examination of diffraction peaks revealed that the diffraction peak of Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 3) shifted to a lower diffraction angle in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts, representing lattice expansion of Al2O3 caused by the incorporation of Ni2+ ions [39,40]. This is because finely dispersed nickel species in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts intimately interacted with alumina."
8,Metal–support interaction in the catalysts,"3.3 Metal–support interaction in the catalysts TPR measurements were carried out to examine the interaction between nickel species and support. It is known that TPR profiles of supported nickel catalysts are strongly affected by the nature of metal–support interaction [41,42]. Fig. 4 shows the TPR profiles of Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts. Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts showed single reduction band at above 700 °C. This means that nickel species strongly interacted with alumina in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts through the formation of nickel aluminate phase, in good agreement with XRD result (Fig. 3). During the formation of nickel aluminate phase, Ni2+ ions are incorporated into tetrahedral sites or octahedral sites of alumina depending on the calcination temperature, nickel loading, and physicochemical properties of alumina [43]. Interestingly, it has been reported that Ni2+ ions located in the octahedral sites of alumina (Nioct) are less reducible than those in the tetrahedral sites (Nitet) [43]. Surface nickel aluminate mainly composed of Nitet is readily reduced at temperature below 800 °C, whereas bulk nickel aluminate with a lot of Nioct is hardly reducible at above 800 °C. Therefore, it can be inferred that nickel species in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts were finely dispersed as a form of surface nickel aluminate [44,45]. Interestingly, the amount of hydrogen uptake on NiAE-SS catalyst was larger than that on Ni/AE-IP catalyst, as listed in Table 2 . Furthermore, reduction peak temperature of NiAE-SS catalysts was slightly lower than that of Ni/AE-IP catalyst. This means that nickel species in the NiAE-SS catalyst were more reducible than those in the Ni/AE-IP catalyst, because Ni/Al atomic ratio in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalyst was nearly identical (Table 1)."
9,Crystalline structure of reduced catalysts,"3.4 Crystalline structure of reduced catalysts Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts reduced at 700 °C for 3 h. It was observed that the diffraction peak of Al2O3 (440) (dashed line in Fig. 5) moved back to the original diffraction angle in the reduced Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts when compared to the diffraction peak in the calcined catalysts (Fig. 3). Furthermore, both the reduced catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic nickel (solid lines in Fig. 5, JCPDS 04-0805). This result indicates that surface nickel aluminate phase in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts was completely reduced into metallic nickel during the reduction process employed in this work. However, NiAE-SS catalyst exhibited relatively broad and weak diffraction peaks of metallic nickel compared to Ni/AE-IP catalyst. This means that metallic nickel in the NiAE-SS catalyst was more finely dispersed than that in the Ni/AE-IP catalyst."
10,Nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts,"3.5 Nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts Nickel dispersion in the reduced catalysts was further confirmed by TEM analyses. Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts reduced at 700 °C for 3 h. No large agglomerates of metallic nickel were found in the reduced NiAE-SS catalyst. However, Ni/AE-IP catalyst retained large aggregates of metallic nickel, representing relatively poor dispersion of metallic nickel in the Ni/AE-IP catalyst. This result is well consistent with XRD result (Fig. 5). To see the particle size distribution of metallic nickel, sizes of 500 metallic nickel particles in the reduced catalysts were directly measured from TEM images (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows the particle size distributions of metallic nickel in the reduced catalysts. Reduced NiAE-SS catalyst exhibited narrow nickel particle size distribution and small average nickel particle size (2.2 nm), whereas Ni/AE-IP catalyst showed relatively broad nickel particle size distribution and large average nickel particle size (3.3 nm). This is because metallic nickel reduced from Ni–O–Al composite structure of NiAE-SS catalyst retained strong resistance toward sintering or aggregation during the reduction process. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted in order to determine the nickel dispersion and nickel surface area in the reduced Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for reduced Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts are listed in Table 3 . It was observed that the amount of hydrogen uptake on the NiAE-SS catalyst was larger than that on the Ni/AE-IP catalyst. As a consequence, NiAE-SS catalyst exhibited higher nickel dispersion and higher nickel surface area than Ni/AE-IP catalyst. This implies that NiAE-SS catalyst retained more active nickel sites for catalytic reaction than Ni/AE-IP catalyst."
11,Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG,"3.6 Hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG Fig. 8 shows the LNG conversions and hydrogen yield with time on stream in the steam reforming of LNG over Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts at 600 °C. Both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG. However, Ni/Al2O3-commercial catalyst experienced a significant catalyst deactivation during the reaction due to the significant nickel sintering and carbon deposition [24,25]. It can be inferred that high surface area, large pore volume, and well-developed mesoporosity of both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts played an important role in facilitating internal mass transfer of reactant and product in the steam reforming reaction. Metallic nickel reduced from surface nickel aluminate phase in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts also stabilized the catalytic performance by suppressing nickel sintering or carbon coking during the reaction. The amounts of carbon deposited on the surface of Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts after a 2500-min reaction were negligible (2.7 and 1.7 wt%, respectively). However, it was observed that NiAE-SS catalyst exhibited a better catalytic performance than Ni/AE-IP catalyst in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen yield. This result can be explained by the excellent chemical and textural properties of NiAE-SS catalyst. High nickel surface area, high nickel dispersion, and well-developed mesoporosity of NiAE-SS catalyst not only provided a large number of active nickel sites, but also suppressed the carbon deposition and nickel sintering through the acceleration of gasification reaction between adsorbed intermediate carbon species and adsorbed steam (–OH2) or hydroxyl molecules (–OH) [46,47]. According to kinetic studies, steam reforming of methane over nickel-based catalysts is related to the various adsorption mechanisms [48,49]. Among various reaction steps, dehydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbon species on the surface of active nickel site (equation (3)) is known as a rate-determining step for overall steam reforming reaction [48,49]. (3) CH 4 + x Ni ∗ ↔ CH x − Ni ∗ + ( 2 − 0.5 x ) H 2 Therefore, high catalytic performance can be achieved by enhancing the number of active nickel sites on the surface of reduced catalysts. It is known that carbon coking reaction requires relatively large number of adjacent active nickel sites compared to steam reforming reaction [48]. This means that steam reforming reaction can be preferentially enhanced by improving the dispersion of active nickel site on the catalyst surface. Fig. 9 shows the XRD patterns of Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts after a 2500-min reaction. Both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts retained metallic nickel (solid lines in Fig. 9). This means that metallic nickel species retained their electronic state even after the steam reforming reaction due to strong interaction between nickel species and alumina in both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts. It was observed that NiAE-SS catalysts exhibited relatively broad and weak diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic nickel. This means that metallic nickel in the NiAE-SS catalyst was much smaller than that in the Ni/AE-IP catalyst. It was further confirmed by TEM images of used Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts (Fig. 10 ). Non-uniformly distributed metallic nickel particles in the reduced Ni/AE-IP catalysts (Fig. 6 (a)) were vulnerable to sintering or aggregation, resulting in the formation of large metallic nickel particle during the steam reforming reaction. On the other hand, no significant change in the size of metallic nickel particle was observed in the NiAE-SS catalyst before (Fig. 6 (b)) and after (Fig. 10 (b)) the reaction due to the uniformly distributed metallic nickel species. It is concluded that NiAE-SS catalyst prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method served as an efficient catalyst in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG."
12,Conclusions,"A mesoporous nickel–alumina aerogel catalyst (NiAE-SS) was prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method for use in hydrogen production by steam reforming of liquefied natural gas (LNG). For comparison, a nickel catalyst supported on alumina aerogel (Ni/AE-IP) was also prepared by an impregnation method. The effect of preparation method of supported nickel catalysts on their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance in the steam reforming of LNG was investigated. It was found that NiAE-SS catalyst retained superior textural properties compared to Ni/AE-IP catalyst. Nickel species were highly dispersed on the surface of NiAE-SS catalyst without significant pore blocking through the formation of Ni–O–Al composite structure. In the steam reforming of LNG, both Ni/AE-IP and NiAE-SS catalysts exhibited a stable catalytic performance. However, NiAE-SS catalyst showed a better catalytic performance than Ni/AE-IP catalyst in terms of LNG conversion and hydrogen yield. High nickel surface area, high nickel dispersion, and well-developed mesoporosity of NiAE-SS catalyst not only provided a large number of active nickel sites, but also suppressed the carbon deposition and nickel sintering. Furthermore, uniformly distributed metallic nickel particles in the NiAE-SS catalyst showed a strong resistance toward carbon deposition and nickel sintering during the reaction. It is concluded that NiAE-SS catalyst prepared by a single-step sol–gel method and a subsequent CO2 supercritical drying method served as an efficient catalyst in hydrogen production by steam reforming of LNG."
