0,Introduction,"Citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) among other α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, is an interesting probe molecule because it presents two reactive conjugated CC and CO bonds and a scantily reactive isolated CC bond. From a commercial point of view, catalytic hydrogenation of citral is important in flavor, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries because it permits to obtain selectively geraniol plus nerol or citronellal following parallel routes, as shown by the reaction scheme in Fig. 1 . In this process unsaturated alcohols are the most valuable products, but citronellal is preferentially formed [1]. Consecutive hydrogenation of these products leads to other important fine chemicals [2]. Ruthenium, which is one of the most inexpensive noble metals, has demonstrated to be intrinsically active in hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, but it is just moderately selective towards the valuable unsaturated alcohols [3,4]. Nevertheless, as it has been frequently reported, selectivity towards the desired products may be improved by means of an appropriate formulation of the catalyst [5,6], modifying the reaction system [7] or even, by using mathematical models to search for the optimal composition of multi-component catalysts [8]. An important aspect of the formulation of the catalysts is referred to the nature of the support [9,10]. In this sense, the electron donor materials as well as those electron acceptors offer interesting possibilities as catalyst supports, because they interact with the metal particles and promote formation of either electron-rich or electron-deficient metal species, respectively. These electronic changes may modify the mode and strength of the metal-reactant interaction and enhance the selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols through different reaction mechanisms [11,12]. On the other hand, for Ru/zeolite supported catalysts it has been pointed out that the geometrical structure of the zeolite induces preferential adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes through the terminal CO carbonyl group, which enhances the stereospecificity towards formation of unsaturated alcohols [13–15]. Recently we have demonstrated the existence of such an effect in hydrogenation of citral over Ru/KL [16] and doped Pt/KL supported catalysts [17]. Likewise, we have analyzed the effect of addition of sulfur compounds to the feedstock [18] and found that certain modifications of the electronic state of the supported metals influence the catalytic performance. Furthermore, it was observed that improvement of hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in terminal position, forced by the geometrical structure of the zeolite, is higher than that provoked by the electronic changes induced on the metal in the same type of catalysts. Now, in order to compare the incidence of the geometrical effects of KL zeolite and the electronic effects promoted by other different reactive supports on the catalytic behavior of Ru, we have studied the citral hydrogenation reaction over three Ru catalysts supported on KL, graphite and ZrO2, respectively. It is known that graphite and zirconia exhibit electron donor properties and moreover, the former can be functionalized in order to modify the properties of the supported metal [19,20]. Accordingly, from a practical point of view graphite and zirconia, as TiO2 in some cases [21] are more effective catalyst supports than other conventional carriers, as alumina or silica, for producing unsaturated alcohols from citral [22] and cinnamaldehyde [23]. The prepared catalysts were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO adsorption microcalorimetry. Kinetic results in the hydrogenation of citral in the liquid phase are analyzed in terms of the electronic and geometrical effects."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Three catalysts containing 2wt.% of ruthenium were prepared by using three supports of very different chemical and geometrical properties: (a) commercial graphite of high surface area (HSAG-200, Lonza LTD, SBET =193m2 g−1) previously treated under He flow at 1173K for removing oxygenated groups from the surface [24]; (b) zirconia (SBET =116m2 g−1) prepared by calcination of zirconium hydroxide (MEL chemical) at 973K for 2h and (c) KL zeolite (Union Carbide, SBET =245m2 g−1) previously calcined at 873K and washed with distilled water. Incipient wetness impregnation of the supports, with particle size in the range 53–65μm, was carried out at room temperature by using ruthenium acetylacetonate in acetone solution. After drying at 393K the samples were reduced at 673K for 2h in flowing hydrogen and then suspended in 2-propanol under inert atmosphere to be afterwards used. No chloride precursors were used in order to avoid electronic effects different to those arising from the specific properties of the supports."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Specific surface area of the catalysts was determined by application of the BET method to the isotherm of N2 adsorption at 77K, obtained in a Micromeritics Asap 2000 system. The number of exposed metal atoms was calculated by both hydrogen and CO chemisorption measurements. The hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed in a conventional volumetric system at 373K, in where the reduced and outgassed samples of catalyst (300mg) were contacted with successive hydrogen pulses between 66Pa and 13.100Pa. The loss of pressure due to the adsorption was measured and the hydrogen uptake determined extrapolating to zero pressure the linear portion of the adsorption isotherm. The number of exposed metal atoms (RuS) was calculated assuming an adsorption atomic stoichiometry H/Ru=1/1 and the metal dispersion of the catalysts (D H) defined as D H =100 RuS/RuL, where RuL is the number of Ru atoms per gram of catalyst, as determined by inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The CO uptake on the catalysts and the evolution of the CO adsorption heat were registered in a Tian Calvet heat-flow microcalorimeter (Setaram C-80 II) isothermally operated at 330K and connected to a glass vacuum-dosing apparatus. The metal surface was titrated by treating the reduced samples with successive pulses of the probe gas, following the experimental procedure described in detail elsewhere [25]. From the total CO uptake at the monolayer, metal dispersion (D CO) was calculated assuming a molar stoichiometry Ru/CO=1/1. The mean metal crystallite size was calculated from the dispersion values assuming the spherical model, d (nm)=1.32/D CO. Temperature-programmed reduction measurements (TPR) were made in dynamic mode, in a conventional device with a quartz U-shape reactor and TCD, heating the unreduced samples from room temperature to 973K, at 5Kmin−1 under a flow of 10% H2/He mixture (20mlmin−1). The TCD signal was registered and, additionally, the effluent gas of the reactor analyzed by GC. Analysis of the catalysts by TEM was performed in a JEOL 2100F field-emission gun electron microscope operated at 200kV. For this purpose a small amount of each sample was dispersed in ethanol and a drop of this suspension placed on the respective lacey carbon film coated copper grid (3.0mm, 200mesh)."
4,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurements Catalytic activity was evaluated in the hydrogenation of citral in the liquid phase. Reaction was performed in an autoclave reactor system with a stainless steel vessel of 300mL (Autoclave Engineers) operated in the batch mode at 323K, 5MPa and 500rpm. The reduced catalyst (0.5g) suspended in 40mL of 2-propanol, was transferred to the reactor containing a mixture of 0.5mL of citral and 60mL of 2-propanol. After outgassing under helium flow, the temperature was risen to 323K, hydrogen fed and the pressure quickly adjusted at 5MPa. At that moment a sample of the reacting mixture was taken and this was considered to be the time zero of the run. Reaction progress with time was followed by collecting periodically aliquots of liquid samples of the reactor, which were analyzed by gas chromatography. Previously, it was verified that under the experimental conditions used the process is essentially controlled by the surface chemical reaction [26]. Hydrogen, before use, was passed through a deoxo purifier and a 5A molecular sieve filter"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Some properties of the catalysts, such as ruthenium loading, dispersion, specific surface area and mean ruthenium crystallite size, calculated from both CO chemisorption (d CO) and TEM measurements (dTEM ) are summarized in Table 1 . As shown, ruthenium loading (Ru) is very similar to the nominal ruthenium content. Metal dispersions, measured either by H2 chemisorption (D H) or by CO chemisorption (D CO), are rather moderated and all in the same order, the mean metal particle size being 8–9nm. In comparison with the respective supports, all the samples show a decrease of specific surface area (SBET ) by effect of the metal loading, especially Ru/KL. Regarding to this catalyst, it is pertinent to remind that the loss of specific surface area, as well as the low value of metal dispersion attained, was attributed to blocking of part of the zeolite channels by small ruthenium particles. Inside of these channels other smaller metal particles remain occluded, without any exposition to the probe molecules [16]. This assertion is now strengthened by observations in the representative TEM image in Fig. 2 , where a high population of homogeneously distributed metal nanoparticles, of around 1nm, can be observed together with other larger ones. From the histogram in Fig. 3 a the mean particle diameter results to be 1.7nm. The fact that the diameters of the smallest particles are comparable to that of the zeolite channel harmonizes with the conviction that those nanoparticles are located within the channels and also with that the mean particle size, calculated from CO chemisorption (d CO =7nm) is overestimated. Study by TEM of the other two samples was also performed and the respective micrographs given in Figs. 4 and 5 . The corresponding histograms are shown in Fig. 3. Micrograph of Ru/HSAG displays metal particles of a wide variety of sizes, in the range 1–11nm, with mean particle size of 5nm. For this catalyst the overestimated value d CO =9nm may be related to changes in the assumed stoichiometry for the CO adsorption (Ru/CO=1). In fact, the higher metal dispersion estimated from the hydrogen chemisorption suggests the formation of bridged CO species (Ru/CO=2/1) in accordance with that previously reported [24]. For Ru/ZrO2, micrograph in Fig. 5a shows a great population of spherical nanoparticles on the highly crystalline support. As shown in Fig. 3 the maximum population corresponds to particles of 2nm, although the mean crystallite size resulted to be 3nm. A detailed analysis of micrographs of this sample reveals that some metal nanoparticles seem to be “as embedded” at the support (Fig. 5b and c) or partially encapsulated with perceptible amorphous material at the metal-support interface (Fig. 5a, d, e and f). Furthermore, some of these particles seem to be covered, at less in part, by a thin overlayer of amorphous material. Accordingly, an important portion of the surface of these ruthenium particles is not exposed to the probe molecules. These observations can explain the overestimated mean particle size derived from the CO chemisorption (8nm) and induces us to believe that some kind of metal-support interaction can take place in that sample. However, since suppression of CO and H2 chemisorption is not complete, such interaction does not attain a SMSI state as that reported by Tauster et al. [27] but reminds the phenomenon described by Coq et al. [28] for other Ru/ZrO2 catalysts. Taking into account the unique properties of ZrO2, it is feasible that partial encapsulation and/or decoration phenomena occur during the impregnation and the subsequent reduction of the catalyst, with formation of Zrn+ species at the metal-support interface, through the reduction of ZrO2 in the close proximity of the metal sites. In this sense, the presence of amorphous phase around of some ruthenium particles is consistent with the rupture of ZrO bonds and the subsequent rearrangement of both the support surface and the crystal lattice [29,30]. The TPR profiles in Fig. 6 show that all the catalysts precursors are reduced bellow 600K. Thus, it can be assured that the three catalysts are completely reduced during the reduction step at 673K. The TPR profile of Ru/KL displays an intense and very well defined peak at 471K, which is overlapped to another one weaker at 411K. Analysis of the exit gases in the range 370–520K indicated that in addition to the signal corresponding to hydrogen consumption, this profile includes those of CO, CO2 and methane originated by decomposition of the ruthenium precursor. This observation evidences that decomposition-reduction of ruthenium acetylacetonate occurs following two successive steps, which may be related to two different oxidation states of the ruthenium precursor, as it has been mentioned in other cases [31]. On the contrary, this profile contrasts with that of a RuO2/SiO2 supported catalyst [32], which exhibits only one peak attributed to a single ruthenium species weakly interacted with the support. The TPR profiles of Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 precursors also display two overlapped reduction peaks. For Ru/HSAG they appear at 406K and 421K, the former being a shoulder of the latter. This profile shows, additionally, a broad and weak peak at 585K, which is related to both hydrogen consumption and methane formation. This evidences a partial gasification of the support, very probably around the metal particles [33]. The reduction peaks in the Ru/ZrO2 profile appear at higher temperatures (477K and 541K, respectively) thus reinforcing the suggestion that a certain metal-support interaction does exist. Hence, it is plausible that during the reduction step not only the ruthenium precursor is reduced but also the surrounding ZrO2 may become partially reduced via spilled-over H2 from Ru particles, as suggested by the observation of amorphous phase in the close vicinity of some Ru particles. No hydrogen consumption was previously observed for the supports under TPR conditions. All the registered reduction temperatures are within the range of those reported in the literature for Ru/SiO2 (440K) Ru/C (510K) [26] and for the unsupported RuO2 (490K) [34] however, the fact that they are different to each other indicates that the reducibility of the metal precursor, in the order Ru/HSAG>Ru/KL>Ru/ZrO2, depends on the nature of the corresponding support. Microcalorimetric profiles in Fig. 7 provide evidence of a high energetic homogeneity of the CO adsorption sites for Ru/KL, while the other two catalysts are energetically more heterogeneous, especially Ru/HSAG. Furthermore, the strength of the adsorption sites is different for each catalyst, the initial adsorption heat being in the order Ru/HSAG>Ru/KL>Ru/ZrO2, in opposite trend to that of the reduction temperatures showed by the TPR profiles. It seems that the easier the reduction of the catalyst precursor the higher the adsorption heat. For Ru/KL the initial adsorption heat, 120kJmol−1, remains unalterable up to coverage degrees around 0.85 and then it declines to physisorption values (40–50kJmol−1). For Ru/ZrO2 the initial adsorption heat (110kJmol−1) also remains practically invariable up to θ =0.50, afterwards it declines to 100kJmol−1 for θ =0.80 and finally it falls sharply to values that may be associated to physisorption phenomena. Ru/HSAG shows the highest initial adsorption heat (160kJmol−1) which quickly decreases down to 120kJmol−1 for a coverage degree as low as θ =0.10. Afterward, it progressively decreases in the range θ =0.10–0.80 and then, for higher coverage degrees, it abruptly declines. Adsorption heats around 120kJmol−1, as that found for Ru/KL, agree with those reported by other authors for linearly adsorbed CO on ruthenium sites weakly interacted with the support, as it occurs for Ru/carbon, Ru/Al2O3 [35], Ru/SiO2 [36], Ru polycrystalline and Ru/TiO2 [37]. The initial adsorption heat calculated for Ru/HSAG (160kJmol−1) may be related to the formation of bridged CO species bonded to the metal, as suggested above. Such a value of adsorption heat is also typical of CO adsorption on electron-rich metal particles, which could be originated by an electron transfer from graphite towards the ruthenium nanoparticles located in the close proximity of edges and corner of the graphitic structure, where the electron donor character of graphite is higher [24,38,39]. It should be noted that the oxygenated groups of the support that can restrain such electron transfer [40] were removed by the previous thermal treatment given to it. The CO adsorption heat found for Ru/ZrO2 (110kJmol−1) is lower than that expected from a hypothetical electron enrichment of the metal due to the basic character of ZrO2 [11,41,42]. These results, as well as those obtained from the TPR analysis, suggest that ruthenium nanoparticles interact with electron acceptor sites rather than with electron donor ones. Indeed, adsorption heats as low as 110kJmol−1 are usually associated to Men+-carbonyl species [43]. For Ru/amorphouszirconia catalysts prepared from acetylacetonate precursor Coq et al. [28] explained the formation of bimetallic RuZrn+ type complex at the RuZrO2 interface, through formation and subsequent decomposition of Zracetylacetonate species. However, since no amorphous zirconia was used in our case, the electron acceptor sites interacting with ruthenium have to be formed through another mechanism, as the one we have suggested above."
7,Hydrogenation of citral,"3.2 Hydrogenation of citral Conversion of citral as a function of the reaction time for the three catalysts is given in Fig. 8 . Initial hydrogenation activity (a 0) and turnover frequency at initial time (TOF) are summarized in Table 2 . The conversion plots show an alike kinetic behavior for samples Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2, the initial activity of Ru/HSAG (a 0 =68μmolgcat −1 min−1) being lightly higher than that of Ru/ZrO2 (a 0 =57μmolgcat −1 min−1) but the TOF values of both catalysts are very similar. It is observed in Fig. 8 that the initial activities of these samples remain nearly stable up to 45–60% conversion, while for higher conversions they gradually decrease. In contrast, the initial activity of Ru/KL, which is substantially lower (a 0 =26μmolgcat −1 min−1) declines after 25min of reaction, when only 12% conversion is achieved. Moreover, TOF is also lower (0.80min−1) decreasing to 0.28min−1 when conversion is 50%. Under these conditions the normalized activity (a 50/a 0) for this catalyst is 0.35, while those for Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 are 0.81 and 0.95, respectively. The overall kinetic behavior of Ru/KL is noticeably similar to those reported for other metal/zeolite catalysts in hydrogenation of different α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, including citral, in where the important activity decay observed is usually attributed to the partial blocking of the metal active sites by the strong adsorption of products of decarbonylation and/or oligomerization reactions [3,44,45]. Likewise, the activity values of Ru/HSAG are comparable to those previously found for other Ru/graphite catalysts in the same reaction working in hydrogen flowing at 333K and atmospheric pressure [26,46] and much higher than those reported for Ru/SiO2 at 300K [3] and Ru/Al2O3 at reflux temperature [47]. With regard to Ru/ZrO2 to our knowledge information about hydrogenation of citral over Ru/zirconia catalysts is not available. Nevertheless, we have found that our results are in a good accord with those published for hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde at 383K and 4.5MPa over different Ru/zirconia supported catalysts [28] where TOFs in the range 84–239h−1 have been reported. The main reaction products for the three catalysts were citronellal, geraniol, nerol and citronellol. Significant concentrations of isopulegol and 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol, together with small amounts of other by-products, were obtained for Ru/HSAG. Selectivities towards these products as a function of the citral conversion for the three catalysts are depicted in Fig. 9 . For Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 selectivity towards geraniol+nerol (SG + N ) increases with conversion from 21% to 25%, initially, up to around 35% for conversions higher than 50%. Selectivity towards citronellal (SCal ) is maximum (>65%) at the start of reaction and then it gradually decreases to values lower than 10%, as result of its consecutive hydrogenation into citronellol. For Ru/KL, in contrast, there is a drastic loss of selectivity towards citronellal with conversion, while the selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols strongly increases from 12%, initially, to 46% when conversion is 40–50%. So, at these levels of conversion Ru/KL results to be the most selective catalyst towards geraniol and nerol. It is well established that hydrogenation of citral is a structure insensitive reaction [47] however, the results about the effect of the metal particle size on the selectivity are rather contradictory [5,48]. Even so, since the ranges of Ru particle size found by TEM for our catalysts are very close, it seems reasonable to attribute the different performances observed to the electronic and/or the textural effects above discussed. Furthermore, the fact that the values of SG + N found for the three catalysts are initially the lowest and then increase with conversion to become the highest, suggests the occurrence of changes at the surface of the catalysts during the reaction time, which seem to be more pronounced in Ru/KL. It is opportune to take into account that zeolites containing Lewis acid sites [49] as well as zirconium-containing catalysts [50] show excellent activity for the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley–Oppenauer reactions. For that reason, in order to verify the possible activity of Ru/KL and Ru/ZrO2 in such reactions under our experimental conditions, kinetic experiments were performed using helium instead of hydrogen. After 10h of reaction either geraniol or nerol were never observed. We believe that abstraction of hydrogen from 2-propanol is highly disfavored at 5MPa and still more under hydrogen pressure. In fact the MPVO reactions are always carried out at atmospheric pressure, at reflux temperature and, of course, in absence of hydrogen. Hence, formation of geraniol and nerol through the MPVO reaction may be discarded under our experimental conditions. It is known that adsorption of citral (E+Z) on the catalyst surface may occur through either the conjugated CC double bond or the CO carbonyl group (Fig. 1) with the subsequent formation of the respective activated complex in the adsorbed phase. Meanwhile, hydrogen is competitively chemisorbed and homolytically dissociated on the metal [51] to give the adatom RuH, (θH). Interaction of one of these reactive complexes with two neighboring θH species leads to the chemisorbed precursor of either citronellal or unsaturated alcohol, which are then desorbed to the liquid phase. In this catalytic process electron-rich as well as electron-deficient metal species at the catalyst surface can promote the formation of unsaturated alcohols following different mechanisms [52] either because they inhibit the hydrogenation of the conjugated CC double bond or because they favor the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. For Ru/HSAG, stabilization of electron-rich ruthenium species (Run-) at the surface, as suggested above, increases the electrostatic repulsion between the metal surface and the conjugated CC bond of citral and favors the back-bonding with the π* CO orbital. As a result, selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols is favored in the detriment of that of citronellal. For Ru/ZrO2 the occurrence of Zrn+ species in the RuZrO2 interface, as suggested by the TEM measurements, in association with Ru0 species located in its close proximity can constitute active sites [Ru0 Zrn+] dual in nature, which may be particularly active for hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of citral, as we recently proposed for Pt-doped catalysts [17]. A plausible actuation of the dual active sites [Ru0 Zrn+] involves adsorption of citral through the CO carbonyl group. in manner that carbon is anchored to Ru0 species while the nucleophilic oxygen is bonded to an adjacent Zrn+ species, of Lewis-acid character. This highly reactive intermediate complex is attacked by hydrogen homolytically dissociated on the surrounding Ru0 sites (θH species) to form the adsorbed precursors of the unsaturated alcohols. In this way activity and selectivity towards geraniol and nerol are enhanced in the competitive transformation of citral. This explanation harmonizes with that given for the behavior of Ru/ZrO2 catalysts in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [28] and with those referenced in several reviews for hydrogenation of different α,β-unsaturated aldehydes over bimetallic catalysts [5,53]. In this context Bachiller-Baeza et al. [26] verified the positive role of Fen+ species on the formation of geraniol and nerol from citral over FeRu supported catalysts. More recently we have noticed the enhanced activation of the carbonyl group of citral over RuCu/KL catalysts by effect of positively charged species in the interface CuRu [54]. Improved hydrogenation activity for the carbonyl group of citral and other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been also achieved by using Ge and Sn as promoters [55,56]. The fact that Ru/KL exhibits the lowest hydrogenation activity and TOF, despite it show evidence of electron-rich ruthenium species arises from some geometrical properties of the catalyst such as the structure of the zeolite and/or the size, shape and location of ruthenium particles inside the zeolite. In this sense the blockage of some channels by metal nanoparticles of around 1nm, occluding part of ruthenium loading, and the hindered free transit of citral through the channels by effect of other smaller metal nanoparticles that diminish the effective diameter of them [16] are responsible for the kinetic behavior of Ru/KL. Indeed, the molecular diameter of citral (0.67nm) [57] is only lightly lower than the aperture of the zeolite channels (0.71–0.78nm) [58]. Although Ru/KL is highly selective towards citronellal at the beginning of reaction, it can be assumed that the blockage and the geometrical constraints of the channels can prevent adsorption of citral through the conjugated CC double bond and force the adsorption end-on CO group on the metal particles obstructing these channels, thus favoring preferential formation of geraniol and nerol in these zones of the catalyst. If this is so, the origin of the increased selectivity values towards unsaturated alcohols with conversion, which is observed in higher degree for Ru/KL, can be explained from the results in Fig. 10 , where the yields to geraniol+nerol and citronellal+citronellol are plotted as a function of the reaction time. For this purpose, since the CC bond of the unsaturated alcohols is much more stable than the CO group of citronellal, we can assume that all citronellol is formed from citronellal. For Ru/KL, as it can be seen, the rate of transformation of citral through hydrogenation of the conjugated CC double bond progressively decreases with time after 25min of reaction, while the hydrogenation rate of the CO group remains practically unalterable along time. These results contrast with those displayed for Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 in Fig. 10, for which the hydrogenation rates corresponding to the conjugated CC and CO bonds of citral decrease in parallel. For Ru/KL, and according to our results, it seems that confined metal sites, where only forced hydrogenation of carbonyl group can take place, are highly resistant to the poisoning effect of the decarbonylation and oligomerization products. As consequence, SG + N continuously increases with time (Fig. 9) and Ru/KL results to be the most selective catalyst toward unsaturated alcohols at conversion levels higher than 50%. It is noticeable, on the other hand, that although the activity losses of Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 are significant lower than that of Ru/KL at conversion levels below 45–60%, for those catalysts SCal also decreases at the beginning of reaction in favor of S G + N . This suggests that, for these catalysts, metal sites able to hydrogenate the conjugated CC bond are also more sensitive to the toxic by-products. All these findings indicate that in order to gain selectivity towards geraniol and nerol, hydrogenation end-on CO group of citral induced by the steric hindrance inside of Ru/KL, together with the higher stability of the hydrogenation active sites only accessible to that functional group, are more effective than the electron-rich or the electron-deficient species formed in Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2, as result of the respective metal support interactions."
8,Conclusions,"Characterization measurements and performances of the prepared Ru/KL, Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of citral have been analyzed and discussed. For Ru/HSAG, formation of electron-rich Ru particles, by effect of the electron donor character of graphite, disfavors hydrogenation of the conjugated CC double bond of citral and promotes that of the CO group. In the case of Ru/ZrO2 stabilization of Ru0 Zrn+ species in the RuZrO2 interface, as suggested by characterization measurements, activates the CO bond and favors formation of geraniol and nerol in the detriment of that of citronellal. In contrast, for Ru/KL occlusion of part of ruthenium loading and constriction of some zeolite channels by small nanoparticles, hinders the free access of citral to the zeolite and reduces the overall hydrogenation activity of the catalyst. Moreover, although this catalyst is scantily selective towards unsaturated alcohols (12%) at low conversion levels, the fact that the active sites of free access to the citral molecule are more sensitive to poisoning than those on the confined nanoparticles, where only forced adsorption end-on CO group of citral can take place, improves the selectivity towards geraniol and nerol when the conversion increases, reaching 46% for 40–50% conversion. It is noticeable, therefore, that geometrical hindrances in Ru/KL influence the activity and the selectivity towards hydrogenation products of citral in a higher degree than the modifications of the electronic state of the ruthenium active sites derived from the metal-support interactions in Ru/HSAG and Ru/ZrO2 catalysts."
