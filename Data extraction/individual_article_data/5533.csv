0,Introduction,"The synthetic processes for fine chemicals often involve the selective reduction of unsaturated carbonyls to unsaturated alcohols. Generally, this type of selective reduction can be achieved using hydride-donor reagents, such as LiAlH4 and NaBH4. However, when the unsaturated groups are conjugated to carbonyl groups, the reagents convert the unsaturated carbonyls to saturated carbonyls or alcohols in some cases [1]. Moreover, the hydride-donor reagents are not suitable for the industrial production of fine chemicals because they are rather expensive and require complicated after-treatments. It is well known that the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction is highly specific for aldehydes and ketones [2]. Thus, this reaction is useful for the selective reduction of unsaturated carbonyls including conjugated ones. However, the reaction has several practical problems, mainly resulting from the poor activities of the aluminum isopropoxide, traditionally used as the catalysts. Generally, almost stoichiometric amounts of the catalyst are required. Recently, Ooi et al. developed new aluminum alkoxides that exhibit high catalytic activities during the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction [3,4]. However, the recovery and repeated use of the catalysts have no practical values. Thus, there is another problem, when this reaction is used for large scale production; that is, waste generation. The reduction of carbonyls to alcohols using supercritical alcohols has been reported by Gubin et al. [5,6], Kamitanaka et al. [7] and Sominsky et al. [8]. It has also been reported by Gubin et al. that the CC bonds of 1-hexene and styrene are reduced to CHCH bonds using supercritical 2-propanol [5,6]. Recently, Nakagawa et al. found that the CC bonds of alkenes with conjugated phenyl group(s) were hydroxyalkylated or reduced using supercritical methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol at the reaction temperatures of 573K and above [9]. In this report, we describe our attempts of the selective reduction of the CO bonds of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols using supercritical 2-propanol (T c =508K, P c =4.76MPa, ρ c =0.273kgdm−3)."
1,Experimental,
2,General,"2.1 General All reagents other than 7-octenal were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. The sample of 7-octenal, which contains 4% octanal, was provided by Kuraray Co., Ltd. The sample was used without further purification. The GC analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu GC-15A (FID, DB-17, 25-m column). The 1H NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker DPX400."
3,Reduction of unsaturated aldehydes using supercritical 2-propanol,"2.2 Reduction of unsaturated aldehydes using supercritical 2-propanol All reactions were carried out in sealed Pyrex tubes (ca. 2mm inner diameter, ca. 70mm length and ca. 3.2×10−4 dm3 inner volume). A portion of the 2-propanol solution of the substrate (the density of supercritical 2-propanol and the concentration of the substrate were specified in the text in each case) was placed in a Pyrex tube with one closed end. The air in the tube was replaced by argon gas and the other end of the tube was fused shut under reduced pressure. After sealing, the tube was placed in an autoclave (SUS316, 0.030dm3) with the appropriate amount of methanol. The methanol was used in order to prevent the tube breaking as a result of a pressure gap. The autoclave was then heated to the reaction temperature (heating time from room temperature to 573K: ∼15min). The reaction time mentioned in the text indicates the period when the vessel was maintained at the reaction temperature. After a specific time, the autoclave was cooled using an air stream to quench the reaction (cooling time from 573 to 473K: ∼5min). The products in the tube were then identified using GC, 1H NMR and IR. The conversions were estimated by GC analyses using the internal standard method."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Reduction of 7-octenal using supercritical 2-propanol,"3.1 Reduction of 7-octenal using supercritical 2-propanol Gubin et al. have reported that the CC bonds of 1-hexene and styrene are reduced to CHCH bonds using supercritical 2-propanol at 683K [5,6]. Nakagawa et al. found that 1,1-diphenylethylene was converted to 3,3-diphenyl-1-propanol (hydroxyalkylation) and 1,1-diphenylethane (reduction) using supercritical methanol at 623K, while no reactions occurred between 473 and 573K [9]. Kamitanaka et al. reported that the CO bond of acetophenone is smoothly reduced using supercritical 2-propanol to yield 1-phenylethanol even at the temperatures as low as 573K [7]. These findings suggest that the reduction of the CO bond using supercritical alcohol proceeds more smoothly than that of the CC bond, and that supercritical alcohols are candidates as reagents for the selective reduction of the CO bonds of unsaturated carbonyls. Based on this idea, 7-octenal was subjected to selective reduction using supercritical 2-propanol. Fig. 1 shows the relation between the reaction temperature and the product distribution (7-octen-1-ol, octanal and 1-octanol). At the reaction temperatures of 473–573K, the amounts of the obtained 1-octanol were negligible. It can be presumed that the formation of octanal from 7-octenal was also negligible, because the 7-octenal used as the substrate contained 4% octanal as impurity. However, the amounts of 7-octen-1-ol increased with the rise in temperature. The selective reduction of the CO bond to 7-octen-1-ol obviously proceeded at 523–573K. Fig. 2 shows the relation between the reaction time and the concentration of 7-octen-1-ol under the different densities of supercritical 2-propanol. The reduction rates of 7-octenal to 7-octen-1-ol are dependent on the densities of the supercritical fluid. The use of high density (0.39kgdm−3) supercritical 2-propanol resulted in the rapid formation of 7-octen-1-ol, and the concentration of 7-octen-1-ol reached the maximum value after 2h. The concentration gradually decreased due to the further reduction to 7-octanol. Fig. 3 shows the relation between the reaction time and the yield of 7-octen-1-ol under the different initial concentrations of 7-octenal. The 0.25–2.0moldm−3 solution of the substrate afforded a similar time course of the reduction and the maximum yield (70–80%) of 7-octen-1-ol was attained at the reaction time of 2h. On the other hand, the higher concentration (3.0moldm−3) of solution afforded a lower yield of 2-octen-1-ol (maximal yield: less than 60%, at the reaction time of 3h). This suggested that the products of the reactions between the substrate molecules, such as the polymerization and the aldol condensation, increased with the increasing substrate concentration. Fig. 4 shows the relation between the reaction time of the 7-octenal reduction and the product distribution, when the reaction was carried out under the following conditions: reaction temperature (573K), density of supercritical 2-propanol (0.34kgdm−3) and concentration of unsaturated aldehyde (0.25moldm−3). It is apparent that the selective reduction of the CO bond proceeded under these conditions. Based on the above results, we decided to apply the above reaction conditions to the reduction of some α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
6,"Reduction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using supercritical 2-propanol","3.2 Reduction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using supercritical 2-propanol Hydride-donor reagents, such as LiAlH4 and NaBH4, have been observed during the reduction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls to give 1,2-reduction products (unsaturated alcohols), 1,4-reduction products (saturated carbonyls) and/or fully saturated products (saturated alcohols) [1]. On the other hand, the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction is highly specific for the 1,2-reduction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls to α,β-unsaturated alcohols, because aluminum alkoxides (Al(OCHR2)3) used as the catalyst, form a six-membered cyclic transition state with α,β-unsaturated carbonyls. The aluminum coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate as does the α-hydrogen to the carbonyl carbon (1,2-coordination). The formation of the six-membered transition state should be a reason why no 1,4-reduction occurred in the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyls. Kamitanaka et al. postulated that the reduction using supercritical 2-propanol proceeds via a six-membered cyclic transition state similar to that for the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction [7]. Subsequently, Sominsky et al. also proposed a cyclic transition state for the uncatalyzed Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction of aldehydes and ketones under supercritical conditions [8]. Thus, we could expect that the supercritical 2-propanol reduction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls would preferentially afford unsaturated alcohols via the 1,2-reduction. Based on this idea, we reduced 3-methyl-2-butenal (prenal), cinnamaldehyde, 2-methylcinnamaldehyde, trans-2-octenal and 2-octynal using supercritical 2-propanol at 573K. These results are shown in Figs. 5–9 . As expected, the use of supercritical 2-propanol resulted in the preferential formation of unsaturated alcohols (1,2-reduction products) for all of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Regardless of the substituents on the α- and β-carbons of the substrates, the conversion of the substrates was greater than 90% and the yields of the saturated aldehydes and the saturated alcohols were negligible at the reaction temperature of 573K. On the other hand, the yields of the unsaturated alcohols were strongly dependent on the substrate structures; the order of the yield of the unsaturated alcohols was prenal (3-methyl-2-butenal)< trans-2-octenal<cinnamaldehyde<2-octynal, 2-methylcinnamaldehyde. For the prenal (3-methyl-2-butenal), the yield of prenol (3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol) was around 50% for the reaction time of 5h. Taking into account the fact that the yield of 3-methylbutanal is negligible, this indicates that the reactions other than the reduction of the CO or CC bond, such as polymerization, acetalization and aldol condensation, smoothly proceeded in the case of prenal (3-methyl-2-butenal). It is noteworthy that the reduction of 2-octynal to 2-octynol proceeded more smoothly than the reduction of the alkenals to alkenols. After 15min, the conversion of 2-octynal and the yield of 2-octyn-1-ol were 95 and 84%, respectively. The high reactivity of 2-octynal suggests that 2-alkynal can easily form the cyclic transition state with 2-propanol. The reduction of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using supercritical 2-propanol was found to afford the 1,2-reduction products. This result is the same as the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction, although the supercritical-reaction system includes no aluminum ions to coordinate to the carbonyl oxygen. This supports the idea by Kamitanaka et al. and Sominsky et al. that the hydroxyl hydrogen of supercritical 2-propanol, in place of an aluminum ion in the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction system, coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen to form a six-membered cyclic transition state."
7,Conclusions,"We examined the selective reduction of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols using supercritical 2-propanol. Unsaturated (conjugated and unconjugated) aldehydes were found to provide unsaturated alcohols as the predominant products. These results further support the previous notion that the reduction of carbonyls using supercritical 2-propanol proceeds via a six-membered cyclic transition state, which is similar to that of the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction. The selective reduction using supercritical 2-propanol is useful for the industrial production of fine chemicals, because it proceeds without the further addition of a catalyst and generates no by-products other than the oxidation product (acetone) of supercritical 2-propanol."
