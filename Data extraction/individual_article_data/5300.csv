0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a cost-effective process that has been widely applied for organic wastewater treatment while also recovering energy as methane [1–3]. The performance of anaerobic digestion depends on the collaboration between several groups of microorganisms carrying out hydrolysis, fermentation, and methanogenesis [4]. The balance between these steps is of crucial importance to maintain the stability in AD. Methanogenic reactions rely on the unimpeded electron flux between microorganisms, thus the efficient interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens is the key to achieving uninhibited anaerobic treatment [5–7]. However, the conversion of fermentation intermediates (especially propionate) to methane can only happen when produced hydrogen is maintained at a very low level (H2 partial pressure lower than 100 ppm) due to the thermodynamics limit [8,9]. The transportation of electrons from intracellular or extracellular electron donors to acceptors across the cell membrane is a process referred to as extracellular electron transfer (EET) [10]. There are two main types of EET mechanisms: mediated electron transfer (MET) and direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) [11]. Compared to MET, DIET is considered to be a more efficient electron transfer pathway through cell components such as e-pili or c-type cytochrome without relying on the diffusion of electron carriers such as hydrogen [9,12]. However, the effective range of DIET between different species is often low [13]. The proposed mechanism for long-range DIET is through cellular appendices such as pilus-like structures or forming filamentous multicellular structure, which allows electron transport at centimeter scales [8,14]. Unfortunately, the biosynthesis of these conductive cell components requires significant energy investment by microbes [15]. Several conductive or semi-conductive materials such as granular activated carbon (GAC), biochar, carbon nanotubes, and magnetite have been reported to greatly enhance the methanogenesis in AD [16–19]. Park et al. [20] reported that under lower temperature conditions (25 °C), GAC supplementation reduced the lag time and increased the maximum methane production rate in rural wastewater anaerobic digestion. These stable and electrically conductive materials promote DIET between electron-donating and electron-accepting cells via a conduction-based mechanism, which compensates for the lack of pili and other cell components involved in DIET. In general, GAC supplementation offers great advantages in AD as reported by many researchers [21–23], and the effects of GAC may go beyond the stimulation of DIET [8]. Another crucial factor that can affect EET and methanogenic processes is the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which can be decreased to an ideal level for methanogenesis with the addition of redox materials such as carbon nanotubes [24,25]. Moreover, the formation of biofilm or granular sludge allows for different bacteria to spatially group together, which remarkably benefits biomass mutual cooperation [26–30]. GAC provides high surface area for bacteria to attach to and shortens the cell-cell distance to achieve efficient interspecies electron transfer. However, the amount of GAC applied in anaerobic reactors is often low, ranging from 0.5 to 50 g/L, and the attached biomass makes up less than 10% of the total biomass yet is responsible for more than 30% of the methane production [16]. In a recent study, a relatively small volumetric ratio of GAC (7% volume) enhanced the organic loading capacity by 4-times and methane production by 1-time [23]. It was revealed that even not directly in contact, GAC enhanced the sludge microbial activity and stimulated microbial community changes based on RNA analysis [23]. Yin et al. [31] and Lv et al. [32] proposed that quorum sensing (QS), which regulates the microbial density and structure by excreting signal molecules, was affected by the addition of conductive materials. Several signal molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and 3′-5′ cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) were reported to regulate the genera that participated in DIET [32–34], indicating that QS may play an important role in adjusting the microbial community to induce syntrophic interactions. Further, the secretion of signal molecules may potentially contribute to sludge granulation, allowing the microbes to stay in close proximate and promotes syntrophic interactions [35]. Further, limited number of studies have applied GAC in a continuous AD reactor operated under low temperature conditions (10–20 °C), which is an aera of interest for AD operation in temperate regions [20]. Due to the heavy nature of GAC, it settles at the bottom of a continuous UASB reactor and limits the contact between GAC and biomass; therefore, it is potentially beneficial to fluidize the GAC. Conventional fluidization of GAC requires maintaining a high up-flow velocity (at least 200 mL/min), as seen in conventional fluidized-bed biofilm reactors (FBBR) [36,37]. To reduce operation costs, other attempts in GAC-fluidization in bioreactors have been investigated. For instance, Park et al. [12] suggested fabricating moving-bed biomass-support media from conductive materials, which prevented the formation of thick biofilms and stimulated DIET more efficiently than fixed-bed media. Recently, Liu et al. [38] demonstrated enhanced AD performance by gluing graphite on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as an electron mediator, however, mechanical mixing was still required. The introduction of low-density carriers to decrease the overall density and increase GAC distribution in the reactor may help to provide better mixing conditions in GAC-based UASB reactors, further improving reactors performances. This study aimed to examine the effect of GAC fluidization on AD reactor performance efficiency. Three UASB reactors, supplemented with plastic biofilm carriers-only, GAC-only and the self-fluidized-GAC (plastic biofilm carriers combined with GAC) reactors were operated and compared under ambient temperature (20 ± 0.5 °C) for 120 days. Fundamental mechanisms with respect to the impact of GAC addition on reactor performance were evaluated and discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental setup and inoculum,"2.1 Experimental setup and inoculum Three up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors with a working volume of 2.0 L each were operated continuously at room temperature (20 ± 0.5 °C) for 120 days. The inoculum sludge (VS 7.4 g/L) was obtained from a full-scale anaerobic digester at a local wastewater treatment plant (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). The Control reactor was supplemented with fifty polyethylene (PE) plastic media of 1-inch diameter (Powkoo, Canada) as shown in Fig. S1. The GAC-only reactor was supplemented with 25 g/L activated carbon pellets (Acurel®, USA), which settled at the bottom of the reactor due to the relatively higher density of GAC (~2 g/mL) than the sludge blanket. The SF-GAC (self-fluidized GAC) reactor was filled with the same amount of GAC in the GAC-only reactor evenly packed into fifty plastic media. The multiple-channel structure in the plastic carriers provides water flow and nutrient access for the bacteria colonization on and captures the produced biogas, allowing carriers move to the upper layer of the sludge blanket by means of buoyancy."
3,Synthetic wastewater and analytical methodology,"2.2 Synthetic wastewater and analytical methodology The composition (per liter) of this synthetic wastewater was as follows: glucose (3.0 g); CaCl2·2H2O (0.026 g); MgCl2·7H2O (0.05 g); NH4Cl (0.23 g); K2HPO4 (0.031 g); KH2PO4 (0.027 g); NaHCO3 (2.0 g); and trace nutrient solution (0.3 mL) as described in our previous work [23]. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of this high-strength synthetic wastewater was 3000 mg/L. The feeding was flushed with nitrogen gas for 15 min to deoxygenate before it was fed to the reactors. COD, total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were determined based on the protocols from Standard Methods of American Public Health Association [39]. The pH was measured with a pH meter (B40PCID, VWR, SympHony). The biogas was collected in a 10 L foil gas bag (CHROMSPEC™, Brockville, Canada) and the methane production was assessed twice a week by measuring the gas volume in the gas bag with a 500 mL syringe, and the composition of biogas was determined using gas chromatography (GC, 7890B Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a Hayesep Q column and a thermal conductivity detector. Helium gas with a 99.999% purity was used as the carrier gas in the system. The operation temperature of the oven and the detector was 100 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The dissolved methane was measured using a NaCl saturation method according to Zhang et al. [40], and the results of which are shown in Fig. S3. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) including acetate, propionate, and butyrate were analyzed using ionic chromatography (IC) (DIONEX ICS-2100, ThermoFisher, USA) equipped with a conductivity detector and IonPac AS18 Analytical Column (2 × 250 mm) after being filtered through 0.22 μm membrane filters (Fisher Scientific, CA)."
4,Sludge characterization and hydrogen inhibition tests,"2.3 Sludge characterization and hydrogen inhibition tests Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests were conducted for sludge from all three reactors at steady state to determine the maximum methane production rate of the incubated sludge for different reactor configurations in different parts of the reactors (up and low layers of the sludge blanket, sampling locations were shown in Fig. S2). For each SMA test, 5 mL of sludge from the reactor was diluted with 15 mL deionized water and added to 38 mL serum bottles. Sodium acetate (1 g/L) and H2/CO2 (volumetric ratio 4:1) were fed into the bottles to determine the activities of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, respectively. The headspace of the bottles was filled with nitrogen gas in the SMA tests for acetate or H2/CO2-mixed gas in the SMA test for H2/CO2 and then sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps. To determine whether DIET-functioning microbes were enriched in the reactors, a high hydrogen partial pressure (about 10 kPa) was applied to inhibit the hydrogen-producing pathway during propionate degradation. The seed sludge was taken from the middle port of the three UASB reactors during steady state operation. 1 to 2 mL of seed sludge was added to 38 mL serum bottles to inoculate with the same amount of sludge VSS. Sodium propionate was used as the sole carbon source. Dipotassium phosphate and monopotassium phosphate were supplied as buffer in lieu of sodium bicarbonate in the nutrient solution to prevent the generation of carbon dioxide from inorganics. The COD concentration of the nutrient solution was 1 g/L and each bottle contained 10 mL of the nutrient solution [41,42]. The high hydrogen partial pressure conditions were achieved by replacing the nitrogen headspace with hydrogen gas. Nitrogen-flushed bottles, with or without GAC, were used as control. Three kinds of activated carbon with different particle sizes, including GAC (activated carbon pellets as applied in the UASB reactors), SAC (small granular activated carbon from Sigma-Aldrich, 4–12 mesh Oakville, ON, Canada) and PAC (powdered activated carbon obtained by grinding SAC), were supplemented (0.055 g/bottle) to serum bottles to investigate the impacts of the carbon-based material size. Batch assay bottles were incubated at room temperature in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm in the absence of light. All batch tests were conducted in triplicates."
5,AHL extraction and analysis,"2.4 AHL extraction and analysis AHL in the sludge and water phases was measured by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) [43]. The following AHLs (>97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Canada) and measured in this study: C4-HSL, C6-HSL, 3O-C6-HSL, C8-HSL, 3O-C8-HSL, C10-HSL, 3O-C10-HSL, C12-HSL, 3O-C12-HSL, C14-HSL, and 3O-C14-HSL. Briefly, mixed liquor was collected from the middle of the UASB reactors three times in one day then centrifuged at 9500 g for 10 min, and sludge pellets were re-suspended in 5 mL methanol with 50 μL protease inhibitor C (Sigma-Aldrich, CA). The mixture was ultrasonicated at 200 W for 30 min and centrifuged again at 9500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then filtered through 0.45 μm membrane filters (Fisher Scientific, CA) and recorded as sludge phase. Similarly, 100 mL of the reactor effluent was centrifuged, filtered, and recorded as water phase. Finally, all the samples were concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with HLB tubes and then evaporated to dryness with a nitrogen evaporator. The samples were dissolved in methanol spiked with 20 μg/L of C4-HSL-d5 as an internal standard before analysis by the LC-MS/MS."
6,Modified Gompertz model,"2.5 Modified Gompertz model A modified Gompertz model (Eq. (1)) was applied to compare the biogas production potential (P), maximum rates of methane production (Rm), and the duration of lag phase (λ, in days) using OriginPro® [44]. The equation is as follows and the fitted curves are shown in Fig. S4. (1) M = P × e x p - e x p R m × e p λ - t + 1"
7,Microbial community analysis,"2.6 Microbial community analysis To compare the microbial communities enriched in reactors with different configurations, suspended biomass samples (account for more than 90% of the total VS) were collected from the top, middle and bottom ports of the reactors (as shown in Fig. S2) at the end of the experiment and were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min. DNA extraction was performed for the sludge pellets using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the universal primer pair 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG) and the 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Miseq platform and analyzed using the QIIME 2 DADA2 pipeline with 99% similarity with reference to the Greengenes database version 13_8. Prediction of microbial functions was done using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) referring to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database [45]."
8,Statistical analysis,2.7 Statistical analysis A student’s T-test using Microsoft Excel® was performed to determine the level of significance between means. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically different results.
9,Results and discussion,
10,Reactors performance,"3.1 Reactors performance 3.1.1 COD removal and methane production Three UASB reactors, including the carriers-only reactor (Control), GAC-only reactor (GAC-only) and the self-fluidized GAC reactor (SF-GAC) were fed with 3 g COD/L glucose and operated at room temperature of 20 °C for 120 days. The GAC in the GAC-only reactor was settled at the bottom of the reactor throughout the experiment and occupied 3% of the total reactor volume; while the GAC in SF-GAC reactor was dispersed along the sludge bed, thus the design enhanced the sludge/GAC contact. The final VSS in the Control, GAC-only and SF-GAC reactor were 12.1, 11.5 and 15.1 g, respectively, indicating that the SF-GAC configuration benefits biomass growth and retaining in a UASB reactor. The organic loading rate was step-wise increased from 500 g COD/m3/d (from days 1 to 54 including 40 days of reactor start-up) to 1000 g COD/m3/d (from days 54 to 68) then to 1500 g COD/m3/d (from days 68 to 120). The addition of GAC (in both GAC-only and SF-GAC reactors) remarkably enhanced reactor performances in terms of COD removal and methane production (Fig. 1 ). During steady state operation (from day 100 to the end of experiment), the effluent COD was 137 ± 45 mg/L in the SF-GAC reactor (with GAC well mixed in the reactor sludge blanket), 201 ± 31 mg/L in the GAC-only reactor (with GAC settled at the bottom of the reactor), while the effluent COD in non-GAC reactor remained high at 1013 ± 50 mg/L. Overall, GAC-amendment in reactors reduced the lag phase for methane production and led to a two-fold higher methane recovery. The methanation rate was 0.66 ± 0.02 g CH4-COD/g influent COD in the GAC-only reactor and 0.77 ± 0.02 g CH4-COD/g influent COD in the SF-GAC reactor, both of which were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of the non-GAC reactor, being 0.33 ± 0.08 g CH4-COD/g influent COD. There was no significant difference in methane production between the GAC-only reactor and the SF-GAC reactor (P > 0.05) until day 79, while after which SF-GAC reactor exhibited a 16.9% higher methanation rate (P < 0.01) compared to the GAC-only reactor. This observation indicates a successful energy recovery system established through the novel SF-GAC UASB reactor design. 3.1.2 COD balance The influent COD has three fates: being converted to methane or accumulating in the sludge bed or effluent. As shown in Fig. 2 , without the GAC amendment, the non-GAC reactor had high COD accumulation in the sludge (35.4 ± 6.7%), only 32.9 ± 8.3% influent COD was converted to methane, and 40.5 ± 9.0% influent COD ended up in the effluent. In comparison, the GAC-amended reactors exhibited remarkably higher methane conversion percentage, with 66.1 ± 1.7% and 77.3 ± 2.2% influent COD converted to methane in the GAC-only and SF-GAC reactors, respectively. As a result, improved effluent quality (10.6 ± 5.1% influent COD for the GAC-only reactor and 6.4 ± 3.0% influent COD for the SF-GAC reactor) and reduced sludge accumulation (21.6 ± 2.6% in GAC-only reactor and 19.0 ± 2.9% in SF-GAC reactor) were observed for GAC-amended reactors. Comparing the two GAC-amended reactors, it was clear that more energy was harvested as biomethane from the SF-GAC reactor."
11,Spatial variation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and activity,"3.2 Spatial variation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and activity Mixed liquor samples were taken from the top, middle, and bottom layers of the sludge blanket in the UASB reactor, along with the effluent to determine the spatial distribution of VFA under steady state conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 , effluent VFA was the highest in the non-GAC reactor and was the lowest in the SF-GAC reactor. This result corresponds to the high methane production and COD reduction in the SF-GAC reactor. Further, for all three UASB reactors, the bottom layers of the reactors exhibited the highest VFA concentrations and lowest pH, as compared to the middle and top layers of each reactor. This observation indicates that fermentation was the dominant process at the bottom of the reactors. Interestingly, for the SF-GAC reactor, although VFAs concentrations remained as the lowest among the three reactors in reactor effluent and in the middle and top layers of the reactor, the SF-GAC reactor had the highest VFAs accumulation at the bottom layer of the reactor as compared to GAC-only and non-GAC reactors. This result indicates that the conversion of VFAs to methane was mainly promoted at the mid and upper layers of the reactor (i.e., middle to top layer of the sludge bed), while a fermentation zone existed at the bottom layer of the SF-GAC reactor. Hence, it can be concluded that the GAC addition not only accelerated the methanogenesis process, but also the acetogenesis rates in the reactor, which may be attributed to the improved syntrophic degradation activities, as described by [15], who found that GAC greatly increased the abundance of syntrophic bacteria such as Syntrophomonas, Symbiobacterium, and Desulfotomaculum species and enhanced the syntrophic methanogenic pathway. The observed low VFA accumulation at the bottom layer of the GAC-only reactor may be attributed to the high methanogenic activities at the bottom layer of the GAC-only reactor (as GAC accumulated at the bottom layer of the reactor). The segregation of fermentation and methanogenesis as observed in SF-GAC reactor provided more principal electron donors (i.e., short-chain fatty acids and alcohols) for DIET-functioning bacteria such as Geobacter species, allowing them to thrive under the competing pressures of various microorganisms in complex organic wastes treatment [46]. On the contrary, the highest VFA and COD accumulation were observed throughout the control reactor, indicating the lowest system stability [47]. Overall, our observations demonstrated that the SF-GAC reactor configuration enhanced the performance of anaerobic digestion by fluidizing GAC and promoting the fermentation and VFA conversion efficiency throughout the reactor, as compared to the conventional GAC-amended (GAC-only) reactor. Fig. 4 illustrated the sludge SMA variations with the supplementation of H2/CO2 or acetate, which were reflected as hydrogenotrophic (SHMA) and acetogenotrophic methanogens activities (SAMA), respectively. The overall methanogenic activities for H2/CO2 were remarkably higher than those for acetate in all three reactors, which indicates that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the predominant pathway. At the bottom layer of the reactors, the SHMA was the highest in the GAC-only reactor (0.052 ± 0.003 g COD/g VSS/d), as compared to the SF-GAC (0.034 ± 0.002 g COD/g VSS/d) and the non-GAC (0.017 ± 0.001 g COD/g VSS/d) reactors. In comparison, at the top layer of the reactor, the SHMA was the highest in the SF-GAC reactor (0.052 ± 0.004 g COD/g VSS/d), as compared to the GAC-only (0.037 ± 0.000 g COD/g VSS/d) and non-GAC (0.037 ± 0.001 g COD/g VSS/d) reactors. The settled-GAC (GAC-only) reactor promoted the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity of the bottom sludge, but not for the top sludge where the biomass cannot get close contact with GAC. The SF-GAC reactor exhibited higher SHMA at both the bottom and top layers, as compared to the non-GAC reactor. It was interesting to observe that SAMA was relatively high in the GAC-only reactor, where no clear spatial variation was observed. The relatively lower SAMA in the top layer of the SF-GAC reactor may be attributed to the high SHMA and syntrophic activities enriched in the SF-GAC reactor. Overall, GAC addition led to a 3 to 6 times SAMA increase, as compared to that in the non-GAC reactor. Comparing to the methane-producing capability that calculated from SMA and the corresponding VSS, the observed methane yield of the control, GAC-only and SF-GAC reactors accounted for 65.4%, 62.5% and 68.8%, respectively. The observed 30% difference may be attributed to the methanogenic activity of the biofilm in each reactor, which was consistent with previous findings [16]."
12,Batch tests under high hydrogen partial pressure,"3.3 Batch tests under high hydrogen partial pressure To examine if the sludge developed DIET-function, high hydrogen partial pressure was introduced to the sludge to hinder the hydrogen producing pathways involved in propionate degradation. DIET offers an alternative to the conventional hydrogen interspecies transfer which can still function under hydrogen inhibitory conditions. Different sizes of activated carbon (i.e., GAC, SAC, PAC) were added to the seed sludge taken from three UASB reactors. The conversion of propionate to methane under different gas compositions and with or without activated carbon conditions were shown in Fig. 5 . Under such high hydrogen partial pressure conditions, only with direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) can methane produced [48]. Adding small-sized activated carbon (SAC and PAC) to the GAC enriched sludge (i.e., seed sludge taken from GAC-only and SF-GAC reactors) enabled methane recovery from propionate under the high hydrogen partial pressures. In contrast, this process was suppressed under hydrogen inhibitory conditions without the supplement of activated carbon, and the addition of pellet activated carbon (GAC) failed to help mitigate the hydrogen inhibition in the serum bottles during the 40 days experiment. Sludge taken from the non-GAC reactor showed little methane production under high hydrogen partial pressure even with the addition of SAC and PAC, indicating a lack of DIET-functional microbial communities. The microbial consortium enriched in the GAC-only reactor started to generate methane in about 25 days with the supplement of SAC and PAC and reached final methane production of 12.12 ± 0.34 and 11.55 ± 0.14 mg-COD, respectively. The high hydrogen concentration showed less impact on the SF-GAC sludge with the addition of SAC and PAC compared to sludge enriched in other reactors. Specifically, 11.75 ± 0.60 and 15.20 ± 0.27 mg-COD methane production was observed for serum bottles seeded with sludge from SF-GAC reactor with SAC and PAC addition, respectively, which was comparable to the N2 and N2 + GAC conditions (12.57 ± 0.32 and 12.65 ± 0.30 mg-COD methane) in these reactors. The maximum gas production rate in the SF-GAC consortium (0.7 and 0.9 mg-COD CH4/d with SAC and PAC, respectively) was more than triple that of the GAC consortium (0.2 mg-COD CH4/d) according to the modified Gompertz model (Fig. S4). Eliminating hydrogen inhibition with the supplementation of small-sized activated carbon, as observed in the microbial consortium enriched with GAC-addition in UASB reactors, indicates the establishment of DIET between microbes. Further, more syntrophic partners that participated in DIET may have been enriched in the SF-GAC reactor compared to the GAC-only reactor, as suggested by the higher methane production rate. GAC fluidization created a better mixing condition that facilitated DIET by acting as an electrical conduit between propionate-oxidizing bacteria and methanogens with higher electron transfer efficiency. In comparison, lower DIET-active microbes were enriched in the GAC-only reactor as indicated by the lower methane recovery rate."
13,AHLs distribution,"3.4 AHLs distribution Eleven kinds of AHL were extracted and detected from the sludge and water phases in three UASB reactors as shown in Fig. 6 . The AHLs were more abundant in the sludge phase than the water phase, indicating the intensive communications between microbes mainly happened in the sludge phase of the reactors and the poor diffusivity and low solubility of AHLs, as also discussed in previous studies [49]. The total AHL concentration in the sludge phase of SF-GAC was 61.48 ng/L, higher than that detected in the non-GAC and GAC-only reactors (45.08 ng/L and 44.25 ng/L, respectively). The AHL composition in each reactor was also different. In the non-GAC reactor, the long-chain AHLs (i.e., C10- to C14-HSL) were more abundant than the short and medium chain AHLs (i.e., C4- to C8-HSL) with 3O-C10-HSL (10.52 ng/L) and C14-HSL (10.62 ng/L) as the predominant AHLs in the sludge phase. In the GAC-only reactor, the medium-chain AHLs were abundant, especially 3O-C8-HSL (8.21 ng/L), followed by 3O-C10-HSL (5.92 ng/L), C8-HSL (5.56 ng/L), and 3O-C6-HSL (5.51 ng/L). Interestingly, both medium- and long-chain AHLs increased in the SF-GAC reactor with four types of AHLs including C8-HSL (9.64 ng/L), 3O-C8-HSL (11.44 ng/L), C12-HSL (8.33 ng/L), and C14-HSL (13.83 ng/L). Overall, the plastic media added in the non-GAC and SF-GAC reactors promoted the excretion of long-chain AHLs, especially 3O-C10-HSL (for non-GAC), C12-HSL (for SF-GAC), and C14-HSL (for both non-GAC and SF-GAC), while the medium-chain AHLs, such as 3O-C8-HSL and C8-HSL, were promoted in both GAC-amended reactors (GAC-only and SF-GAC reactors). The total concentration of short- and medium-chain AHLs showed a positive correlation with the methane production in all three UASB reactors. Processes such as plasmid transfer, swarming, bio-surfactants production, EPS excretion, growth, and motility were reported to be influenced by 3O-C8-HSL and C8-HSL, which were predominantly found in GAC-amended reactors [50–53], implying the stimulating effect of conductive material on system performance might be associated with the elevated levels of medium-chain AHLs. C4-HSL, 3O-C6-HSL and 3O-C8-HSL were identified as the specific QS signals of hydrolytic-fermentative bacteria, which might be associated with the enhanced fermentation in SF-GAC reactor comparing to the non-GAC reactor [54]. Further, 3O-C8-HSL and C12-HSL have been reported to positively correlated with hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which were promoted by GAC addition, indicating an interspecific coordination of syntrophic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens mediated by the signal molecules [55]. Specifically, cellular morphology such as the growth of long filaments of Methanosaeta harundinacea 6Ac were reported to be promoted by AHLs and altered carbon metabolic flux that favored the conversion of acetate to methane [56,57], which might be the case in the GAC-amended reactors since the acetate conversion by filaments had a higher reaction rate comparing to short cells [57]. Long-chain AHLs, such as 3O-C10-HSL, C12-HSL, and C14-HSL, were mainly found in the carrier-supplied reactors (non-GAC and SF-GAC reactors), which might be related to the biofilm formation on the carriers [58]."
14,Microbial community and functionality analysis,"3.5 Microbial community and functionality analysis The most abundant and representative genera in three UASB reactors were shown in Fig. 7 . At the bottom layers, non-GAC and SF-GAC reactors had the dominant bacteria being an unclassified genus in family Enterobacteriaceae (27.0% and 37.1%, respectively). Enterobacteriaceae ferment glucose with acid production, which correlated well to the low pH and high VFA concentrations in these zones (Fig. 3), indicating that acidogenesis was the main process at the plastic-carriers-amended reactors bottom. In the presence of GAC at the bottom layer of the UASB, the dominant genera for GAC-only reactor were one uncultured genus in Clostridiales order (28.6%) and Clostridium (24.2%). Clostridium are often observed in the presence of sugar to produce organic solvents such as butanol. Further, this fermenter has been reported to acting as an electron sink that consumes extracellular electrons, which may play an important role in controlling the redox balances in a GAC-filled zone [59]. In the middle and top layers, one uncultured genus in Clostridiales order and Lactococcus were predominant in the non-GAC control reactor, which accounted for 18.9% and 18.8% in the top layer, and 45.7% and 10.8% in the middle layer, respectively. However, an unclassified genus in order Bacteroidales, Treponema and genus T78 were more abundant in the middle and top layers of both GAC-amended reactors. Treponema contains known homoacetogens that produce acetate from hydrogen and carbon dioxide [60], which was consistent with the significantly higher SAMA observed in the GAC-amended reactors. The syntrophic fatty acid metabolizers such as Syntrophus, Syntrophomonas and Geobacter only existed with low abundance in control reactor (less than 0.2%), but had much higher abundance at the upper reactor zones with GAC addition (0.3% to 2.3%). It has been reported that Syntrophus is likely to produce e-pili and grow via DIET [61]. Similarly, Syntrophomonas was a previously reported putative DIET participant and was greatly enriched on the GAC surface [62]. Further, many Geobacter species are exo-electrogens and are considered as DIET indicator microorganisms, the relative abundance of which increased up to 8 times and 44 times in the GAC-only reactor and the SF-GAC reactor comparing to the control reactor, respectively. At the genus level, 13 archaeal taxa were detected among all samples (Fig. 7B). The dominant genera were Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium, accounting for 36.0% to 47.1% and 27.5% to 42.5% in the control reactor, respectively. With GAC added at the bottom of the reactor (GAC-only UASB), Methanosarcina was enriched throughout the reactor, and Methanobacterium only accounted for 15.5% to 24.4% in the reactor. In comparison, Methanosarcina was greatly enriched at the middle and top zones (62.9% to 77.5%) of the SF-GAC reactor, and the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium dominated the reactor bottom (64.2%). Our results suggested that location of GAC amended played a significant role in controlling the spatial distribution of microbial community in the UASB reactors. Methanosarcina, a potential DIET-active methanogenic archaea that could accept extracellular electrons [12], was remarkably enriched in the GAC-only reactor and the upper zones in SF-GAC reactor. The coexist of exo-electrogenic bacteria (e.g., Geobacter) and Methanosarcina indicated that DIET-based syntropy between these microorganisms occurred in GAC amended reactors (throughout the GAC-only reactor and middle to top layers in SF-GAC reactor). Further, Methanospirillum, which was not detected in the non-GAC reactor, but has been reported to produce electrically conductive archaellum enabling long-range electron transfer [63], was enriched in GAC-amended reactors, with the relative abundance ranging from 2.4% to 5.1% in the GAC-only reactor and from 4.3% to 11.4% in the SF-GAC reactor. These results indicated that GAC supplementation would stimulate the growth of previous reported DIET-active microorganisms and GAC fluidization further enriched well-known DIET partners such as Geobacter and Methanosarcina, boosting methane production by enhancing DIET. The functional profiles of the microbial communities in three UASB reactors were predicted using PICRUSt as shown in Fig. 8 . At the reactors bottom, control and SF-GAC reactors showed similar functional patterns, which were significantly different from those observed in the GAC-only reactor, indicating that the presence of GAC at the reactor bottom greatly influenced the characteristics of the microbial functional profiles. At the bottom layer of both control and SF-GAC reactors, microbial functions in relation to membrane transport, signal transduction, transcription, and metabolism including carbohydrate metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of other amino acids, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were promoted, as compared to the bottom layer of the GAC-only reactor. This observation correlated with the higher substrate concentrations in control and SF-GAC reactors (see Section 3.3); suggesting that the nutrient availability plays significant roles in the development of these functional profiles. In comparison, the bottom of GAC-only reactor showed the highest prevalence of translation, replication and repair, folding, sorting and degradation in the genetic information processing group, which may be correlated to the accelerated cellular response to GAC. Further, the cell motility function, which can be used as an indicator of conductive pili growth that facilitates cell-to-cell attachment and electron transfer [64–66], was greatly increased in the bottom of GAC-only reactor. For the top layer biomass, both GAC amendment strategies stimulated similar microbial functions, different from those from the control reactor. For instance, as compared to the control reactor, the cell motility was promoted at the top layer of both GAC-amended reactors (i.e., GAC-only and SF-GAC). Higher energy metabolism was also observed in GAC-amended reactors, which correlated well with the enhanced methane metabolism in these reactors, similar to the results reported in the literature [67]. Moreover, compared to the control and GAC-only reactors, SF-GAC showed the highest prevalence of the signal transduction function in both top and bottom zones. This result correlated well with the AHL variations. These findings further demonstrate that SF-GAC configuration achieved better performance through process segregation (hydrolysis at the bottom and methanogenesis at the top), while the GAC-only reactor indistinctively enhanced the microbial activities throughout the reactor."
15,Implications,"3.6 Implications Enhanced methane recovery was achieved through self-fluidizing GAC in a UASB reactor, which enhanced the contact of GAC with the digester sludge without the need for mechanical mixing. Enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activities were observed throughout the reactor depth. Although previous studies have demonstrated that adding conductive materials to anaerobic digesters can improve methane recovery, no direct evidence of DIET has been reported for continuously operating AD reactors [46]. In the present study, hydrogen inhibition experiments provided direct evidence of the enrichment of DIET-active microbiome in both GAC-amended reactors. Further, various GAC-amendment strategies influenced the methanogenic activities differently. Efficient VFA reduction in GAC-only reactor (where GAC accumulated at the bottom of the UASB) and an elevated VFA at the bottom of the reactor, which was then significantly reduced through syntrophic metabolism at the top of the reactor (observed in SF-GAC reactor, where GAC was well distributed throughout the reactor depth) demonstrate the importance of optimizing the reactor design to realize the full benefits of DIET-active reactors."
16,Conclusion,"This study evaluated the performance of a modified UASB reactor amended with self-fluidized GAC. Enhanced methanation rates and organics removal were achieved in the novel configuration without external heating and mixing requirements as compared to the non-GAC and the GAC-only reactors. The enriched microbial consortium in both GAC-amended reactors can mitigate hydrogen inhibition with the supplement of small-size activated carbon, while the non-GAC reactor cannot. DIET participants (e.g., Geobacter and Methanosarcina) were enriched in the GAC-amended reactors especially the SF-GAC reactor. Medium-chain AHLs (3O-C8-HSL and C8-HSL) were identified as key signaling molecules, which might associate with the promotion of DIET between syntrophic partners. The self-fluidized GAC reactor exhibited a clear separation in reaction zones, where fermentation largely existed in the lower zone and enhanced methanogenesis dominated in the upper zone of the reactor. Our study suggests an economical and efficient reactor configuration that increases methanogenic activity by reinforcing the contact between GAC and sludge, providing a novel strategy for future reactor design."
