0,Introduction,"With increasing pollution and the shortage of traditional fossil fuels, efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are essential. Although platinum group metals exhibit high efficient HER activity in water-splitting technologies, the high cost and low abundance are the main reasons to hinder their applications [1,2]. Therefore, the synthesis of a cost-effective electrocatalyst with high performance is supreme desirability, especially in the case of water splitting for large-scale H2 production at a high current density (100 mA cm−2) [3–5]. Earlier reports about tungsten carbide-based materials as HER electrocatalysts were investigated due to their low cost, high electrochemical stability, and analogous electronic structures with Pt [6–8]. In reality, these materials could not replace the noble metal catalysts yet mainly because of their poor activities at a high current density.[9,10] It is well known that more active sites, higher activity in each site, and fast electron & mass transport can be tailored via the materials' microstructure design, heteroatom doping, and surface/interfacemodification to facilitate the HER kinetics [8,11–13]. In these tungsten carbide-based materials, W2C is a significantly more active HER catalyst, proven in the Gong group's theoretical calculations [14]. Furthermore, improving the electronic conductivity of these W2C-based materials can also enhance their HER performances [15,16]. A common way is introducing a functional carbon to hybridize or seal the W2C, such as rGO, CNTs, and organic framework-derived carbon [14,17–18]. However, these hybrid materials were usually prepared by solution-based preparation methods, which might cause the aggregation of W2C nanoparticles during the thermal treatments, decreasing the available active sites [19]. Electrospinning is a versatile and straightforward technology for synthesizing one-dimensional nanomaterials, which could induce a faster electron transport [20,21]. Meanwhile, carbon matrix derived from polymerhas multiple functions in electrospinning-assisted carbothermal hydrogen reaction synthetic strategy: a reducing agent to facilitate the transformation of WO3 to W2C, an adjuvant for enhancing their conductivity, inhibiting the agglomeration of W2C nanoparticles [22,23]. Therefore, combining the 1D structure and embedding W2C nanoparticles within the carbon matrix could be favorable for faster electron transport, thus significantly enhancing HER activity, further boosting the HER performance at high current densities. Motivated by the above considerations, pure-phase W2C nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers (W2C/C NFs) were obtained by a synthetic strategy of electrospinning-assisted carbothermal hydrogen reaction. The as-prepared hybrid nanofibers exhibited superior HER activity over broad pH ranges, requiring small overpotential (η) of 92, 81, and 115 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral medium, respectively. Significantly, the activity of W2C/C NFs could precede the commercial Pt/C at high current densities in alkaline media, revealing its potential application at high current density. This efficient HER activity was mainly assigned to their 1D structures, embedding W2C into the carbon matrix and the optimized thickness of carbon layer."
1,Experimental section,"Synthesis of W2C/C NFs: In a typical procedure, 0.6 g of PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Mw = 1300000) and 1.3 g of AMT (Ammonium metatungstate, Mw = 2956.26) were dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water stirring for 12 h at room temperate (RT). After that a homogenous precursor solution was obtained for further electrospinning, performed at a voltage of 15 kV, a collection distance of 11 cm and a flow rate of 0.01 mL min−1 under RT. The electrospun nanofibers were preoxidized at 200 °C for 6.0 h in air. Finally, the black nanofibers were obtained under H2/Ar (VH2:VAr = 20 mL min−1:50 mL min−1, precisely controlled by the flowmeter) at 700 °C for 2.0 h with a rate of 2.5 °C min−1, named as W2C/C-20 NFs. Other samples were synthesized using a same heat treating process followed to W2C/C-20 NFs, except the different hydrogen content, such as VH2:VAr = 10 mL min−1:50 mL min−1 and VH2:VAr = 30 mL min−1:50 mL min−1, denoted as W2C/C-10 NFs and W2C/C-30 NFs, respectively. As a control experiment, the W2C/C nanoparticles were prepared by the simple mixture of PVP and AMT under the same heat treating conditions with W2C/C-20 NFs, named as W2C/C-20 NPs. Characterization: Employing a series of devices examined the as-prepared materials' composition, morphology, microstructure, and chemical analyses. Based on a three-electrode cell, the electrochemical measurements of the electrocatalyst for HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS mediums were tested on a AUTOLABPGSTAT302N electrochemical station, respectively. Approximate 5 mg of the catalyst was mixed with 290 μL of isopropyl alcohol and 10 μL 5 wt% Nafion. 15 μL of the slurry was pipetted with a micro-syringe and spread on the polished Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface and the electrode was dried under the infra-red lamp. The detailed testing were exhibited in Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI) [24]."
2,Results and discussion,"Schematic illustration for fabricating W2C/C NFs is shown in Fig. 1 . The precursor nanofibers containing AMT and PVP exhibited a continuous 1D structure with a relatively uniform diameter after heating in the air at 200 °C for 6 h. Then, the W2C/C nanofibers were formed at 700 °C under H2/Ar atmosphere, proved by the samples' XRD pattern. As displayed in Fig. 2 a, the main characteristic diffraction peaks at 34.5°, 37.9°, 39.4° and 52.3° were assigned to the (100), (002), (101) and (102) crystal planes of W2C (PDF No. 35–0776), respectively [25]. During carbonization treatment, H2 as a promoting agent played a critical role in facilitating the formation of W2C. Pure-phase W2C was produced when the H2 gas flow was higher than 20 mL min−1 and metal W (PDF No. 04–0806) was detected in W2C/C-10 NFs as the gas flow of H2 decreased to 10 mL min−1. Further considering that the pyrolysis of AMT and PVP occurred around 400 °C, a possible formation mechanism of W2C during carbothermal hydrogen reaction could be described as follows: WO3 + H2 → WOx + H2O (2 < x < 3)(1) WOx + H2 → WO2 + H2O(2) WO2 + H2 → W + H2O(3) CO → C* + CO2(4) W + CO → W2C + CO2(5) WOx + C* + H2 → W2C + CO + H2O(6) where C* is atomic carbon. W2C was formed by the reaction of (5) and (6), which is similar to the formation of Mo2C [26]. It was also reported that W2C could convert to WC in a CO-rich atmosphere by reaction between W2C and atomic carbon (C*) or CO [27,28]. However, in our case, WC was not detected, indicating that the carbothermal hydrogen reaction stopped at W2C, mainly due to the high ratio of H2 and relatively low reaction temperature (700 °C) [29]. Therefore, the process for W2C, in this case, could be WO3 → WOx → WO2 → W → W2C. The FT-IR spectra of pre-oxidation nanofibers and their composites are shown in Fig. 2b. The broad region between 750 and 1000 cm−1 in the spectra of W2C/C NFs belonged to the W-C/W = O vibrations [30]. The similar characteristic absorbance peaks indicated their analogical composite, which was well agreed with XRD results. SEM and TEM were employed to characterize the morphology and microstructure of W2C/C NFs. Low magnificationSEM images (Fig. 2c,e,g) revealed that all samples possessed a 1D structure with an average diameter of 200–300 nm. Further, the high magnification SEM images (the insets in Fig. 2c,e,g) indicated that the metal carbides were uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix. Based on their typical TEM micrographs and the element mappings of W and C (Fig. 2d,f,h and Figure S1), it could be observed that W2C nanoparticles were homogeneously embedded in the carbon matrix without apparent aggregation. The lattice fringes of nanocrystals depicted by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), with a spacing of about 0.25 nm, were in good agreement with the spacing of (100) plane of W2C. Moreover, an amorphouscarbon layer formed on the surface of W2C nanoparticles in W2C/C NFs could be observed. The thickness of the carbon layer gradually decreased with the increase in the H2 amount, which was attributed to the fact that the metal W could further react with carbon to produce W2C under a high H2 ratio. The decreased carbon content can further demonstrate this in W2C/C NFs (Fig. 3 a), as the residue was WO3 after oxidation in the air. Therefore, the carbon content in W2C/C-20 NFs and W2C/C-30 NFs was approximately 1.1 wt% and 0.82 wt%, respectively. Embedding W2C into carbon matrix can efficiently limit carbide overgrowth, provide more exposed active sites, and facilitate a high-efficiency electron transfer, leading to an enhanced HER activity [31,32]. It should be noted that carbon is inactive for catalytic HER. The thick carbon layer on the surface of W2C may weaken the interaction of W2C and hydrogen, leading to inferior HER activity. Therefore, an optimized thickness of the carbon layer on the surface of W2C could have an important influence on the HER activity of W2C. The structural peculiarities of W2C/C NFs were further evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. The peaks located at 693 and 807 cm−1 were due to the stretching mode of W-C (Fig. 3b) [12]. The peaks located at 1356 and 1580 cm−1 were assigned to D and G bands related to disordered carbon and sp2- hybridized graphitic carbon, respectively (Figure S2) [33]. In this case, the ID/IG intensity ratios of W2C/C-10 NFs, W2C/C-20 NFs, and W2C/C-30 NFs were 1.01, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. The tiny difference of these values demonstrated a similar graphitic degree, indicating that the variety of HER catalytic activity was not led by conductivity differences [34]. XPS measurements revealed the surface chemistry of W2C/C-20 NFs. The high-resolution W 4f spectrum is seen in Fig. 3c. The strong peaks at 31.7 and 33.9 eV were attributed to the W-C bond [35]. The other peaks at 35.7 and 37.8 eV were assigned to the inevitably surface oxidation of W2C in the air [25,36]. Compared with W2C/C-20 NFs, there were more oxidized species on the surface of the W2C/C-30 NFs, as shown in Figure S3. This may result from the fact the too thin carbon layer could not provide efficiency protect of W2C from oxidation, which might be weakening their HER catalytic activity. Fig. 3d is the high-resolution C 1 s spectrum for W2C/C-20 NFs, which could be deconvolved into four binding energy peaks. Here, the binding energies of 282.8, 283.6, 284.7, and 286.9 eV were attributed to C-W, C–C/C = C, C-N, and C = O species, respectively [37]. Figure S4 shows the specific surface area and pore structure of W2C/C-20 NFs, from which the specific surface area of W2C/C-20 NFs is about 9.5 m2 g−1 with hierarchical pore-size distributions of around 4.85 and 7.51 nm. These nanopores were mainly attributed to the carbothermal reduction reaction of WO3 and C matrix, which can offer abundant channels for mass transfer. The electrocatalytic activities of W2C/C NFs towards HER in an alkaline electrolyte were evaluated with a regular three-electrode setup [24]. The LSV polarization curves of 20% Pt/C and as-prepared samples were recorded under the same loading amount at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. As expected, the commercial Pt/C catalyst showed the highest HER activity with an overpotential (η10) of 29 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2. Among W2C/C NFs catalysts, the W2C/C-20 NFs presented the best HER performance with η10 of 81 mV. In this case, the performance was evaluated by traditional GCE rather than the metal-based foam, carbon cloth or self-supported materials with large supportive areas [38–41]. This activity was superior to W2C/C-10 NFs, W2C/C-30 NFs, and many reported HER catalysts in alkaline condition, as summarized in Table S1. Furthermore, the HER performance of as-prepared catalysts preceded the commercial Pt/C at high current density (Fig. 4 b). As an inherent parameter for electrocatalysts, the Tafel slope (η = a + blog(j), where b represents the Tafel slope) was used to investigate the HER process's kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Tafel slope for the W2C/C-20 NFs was 53.5 mV dec-1, much smaller than those of W2C/C-10 NFs (69.8 mV dec-1) and W2C/C-30 NFs (63.9 mV dec-1), suggesting more favorable kinetic properties. Additionally, Tafel slope values also indicate that the HER took place on the surface of all electrocatalysts, following a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism [42]. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the charge transfer kinetics. The Nyquist curves recorded at η of 100 mV (Fig. 4d) exhibit that the W2C/C-20 NFs had the lowest semicircle diameter in the high frequency region, which was obtained by fitting a equivalent circuit model (Figure S5). This result means the smallest charge transfer resistance and more facile charge transfer properties [17]. To obtain the origin of superior activity of the W2C/C-20 NFs, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) derived from CV at different scan rates. As presented in Fig. 4e and Figure S6, the Cdl of W2C/C-20 NFs was 85.06 mF cm−2, which was higher than those of W2C/C-10 NFs (46.93 mF cm−2) and W2C/C-30 NFs (50.29 mF cm−2), indicating more active sites in W2C/C-20 NFs [32]. As another significant aspect of HER catalysts, the stability of W2C/C-20 NFs electrocatalyst was evaluated by chronoamperometry at η of 81 mV. As presented in Fig. 4f, the current density exhibited a relatively constant output with a decrease of ~12% during 10 h testing, suggesting its good long-term stability. This was further proved by the comparing LSV polarization curves before and after 3000 continuous CV scanning, displaying a slight change of current after 3000 cycles test. Moreover, the composition and morphology of W2C/C-20 NFs after 3000 CV cycles measurement was investigated by SEM, XRD and XPS (Figure S7), which were no noticeable changes, proving the W2C/C-20 NFs as electrocatalysts with excellent structural stability. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic HER performances of 20% Pt/C and as-prepared W2C/C NFs electrocatalysts were investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4. The W2C/C-20 NFs exhibited the best HER performance with η10 of 92 mV (Figure S8a and S8b). As can be seen in Figure S8, the smaller Tafel slope (63.5 mV dec-1), larger Cdl (108.5 mF cm−2) and smaller Rct of W2C/C-20 NFs than those of the W2C/C-10 NFs and W2C/C-30 NFs further demonstrated its faster kinetics, more exposed active sites and faster charge transfer process. The stability of W2C/C-20 NFs electrocatalyst in acidic solution is presented in Figure S8f. The polarization curve after 3000 cycles test exhibited a negative shift by only 9.8 mV on η10 from the initial one. Meanwhile, the current density from chronoamperometry measurement at η of 92 mV remained 81% of original value after more than 10 h operation. These results suggested the robust durability of W2C/C-20 NFs electrocatalyst in acidic solution. Moreover, the HER performance of W2C/C NFs were also investigated in neutral solution (Figure S9). The W2C/C-20 NFs catalyst exhibited superior performance with η10 of about 115 mV and good durability, as illustrated by the curves of LSV after continuous 3000 CV cycles and chronoamperometry measurement. The intrinsic activity for 20% Pt/C, W2C/C-20 NFs and W2C/C-30 NFs was also evaluated by turn-over frequency (TOF), as shown in Fig. 5 and Figure S10, which were calculated based on the assumption that all metal ions of the catalyst can contribute to the electrocatalytic HER performance [24,40]. Compared with W2C/C-30 NFs, the W2C/C-20 NFs catalyst presented a dramatically increased TOF value with an increasing overpotential in alkaline and acidic solutions, respectively. The samples of W2C/C-20 NFs and W2C/C-30 NFs with the same characteristic signals of W2C exhibited a noticeable difference in HER performance. As discussed earlier, the W2C/C-30 NFs with slight amorphous carbon lead to more severe oxidation on their surface than that of W2C/C-20 NFs and, consequently, causing weakened electrocatalytic properties. Moreover, we compared the LSV polarization curves of W2C/C-20 NPs and W2C/C-20 NFs, indicating the 1D structural advantages for enhancement the HER performance (Figure S11). Based on the above results and discussions, W2C/C-20 NFs with excellent HER performances could be mainly attributed to the following reasons: (1) W2C nanoparticles embedded in carbon matrix prevented the nanoparticle aggregation during the synthesis, providing abundant accessible active sites [43]. (2) The synergistic effect of embedding W2C in the appropriate carbon matrix could regulate the electronic structure of active sites and thus facilitate a significant increase of HER activity. (3) the unique 1D nanostructures would provide a continuous and effective conductive network in micrometer scale [44]. (4) the carbon layer on the surface of W2C could improve the dispersity of nanosized W2C to avoid agglomeration, reduce the electrical resistance among active nanocrystals, and avoid the oxidation of W2C nanoparticles to guarantee high stability of the electrocatalyst during long-term operation [45–48]. Therefore, combining the architectural structure and composing features, the W2C/C-20 NFs should be an efficient HER electrocatalyst at high current densities."
3,Conclusions,"In summary, W2C/C NFs had been fabricated by electrospinning and subsequent carbothermal hydrogen reaction. The W2C nanoparticles in-situ formed during carbonization and uniformly dispersed in the carbon nanofibers with 200–300 nm nanometers. As-prepared W2C/C-20 NFs displayed excellent HER activity at broad pH, featuring with low η10, small Tafel slope, and long-term stability. Significantly, W2C/C-20 NFs exhibited η of 81, 137, and 157 mV to reach 10, 100, and 200 mA cm−2 in alkaline media, respectively. The results of this work would provide some new paves to explore tungsten-based Pt-like electrocatalysts toward HER and other catalytic system.
