0,Introduction,"Since its isolation in 2004, graphene, the single atomic layer that consisted of sp2-bonded carbon atoms, has attracted significant attention due to its unique mechanical, electrical and thermal properties [1–3]. The popularity of graphene has also stimulated renewed interests on graphite oxide (GO), because GO can be served as a precursor for large-scale synthesis of graphene [4]. Recently, more and more researchers have paid attention to the role of GO nanosheet (GONS) as reinforcement agent in polymer composites. The use of GONS offers several advantages over the pristine graphene. For example, GONS can be readily exfoliated into single-layered or few-layered sheets in aqueous or some organic solvents. The excellent dispersibility of GONS can even result in the formation of liquid crystals [5] and facilitate the fabrication of macroscopic assembly of graphene [6] and homogenous polymer composites. Furthermore, the functional groups attached on the GONS can cause strong interactions with host polymers [7–9]. In the past few years, many composites, such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [10,11], chitosan [12], and epoxy [13], have been fabricated based on GONS. However, in these studies, with the aim of sufficiently oxidizing graphite, all the preparation methods for GO have used excess amount of oxidant. Although the fully oxidized GO could be well exfoliated, the complete oxidation inevitably introduced a large number of structural defects, such as wrinkles, crumples and atomic vacancies into the graphene [14,15], which were detrimental to the intrinsic properties of GONS, and could lower the performance of GONS in high-performance polymer composites. Moreover, the highly oxidized and defective GONS was unsuitable to prepare high-quality graphene, because even if the oxygen-containing groups could be removed to a large extent, the structural defects were still remained in the reduced GONS [16,17]. Therefore, from the materials science point of view, it is important to prepare less oxidized and less defective GO to create relative high-quality GONS for real applications. In fact, some previous reports have already tried to tailor the characteristics of GO by adjusting the preparation parameters. For instance, Lee et al. have synthesized a series of GOs using Brodie and Staudenmaier methods, they found that the ratio of sp3 carbon to sp2 carbon varied with different oxidation times, however, the long oxidation times they applied could also introduce significant damages to the graphene [18]. Jeong et al. also characterized different GOs prepared by Brodie method. They reduced the oxidation time as short as 5min, but they did not consider the exfoliation behavior of the less oxidized GO, which was indeed a critical aspect of the practical use of GO [19]. Xu et al. used a modified Hummers’ method with less oxidant to prepare mild oxidized GO, but their focus was mainly on the performance of the corresponding reduced GONS, while neglected the effect of oxidation on the characteristics of GO and corresponding GONS [20]. Similarly, Eda et al. have prepared partially oxidized GONS by reducing the amount of oxidant during oxidation, followed by intercalating tetrabutylammonium hydroxide into the partially oxidized GO. They also investigated the reduction behavior of the partially oxidized GONS and the performance of the corresponding reduced GONS [21]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the relationship between the extent of oxidation of GONS and its reinforcement effect on polymer composites. In our previous researches, we paid great attention to the reinforcement of polymer composites by graphene-based materials [22,23]. In this study, in order to optimize the reinforcement effect of GONS, we synthesized GONS with different characteristics, and used them as nanoscale fillers for fabrication of polymer composites. Firstly, we used a modified Hummers’ method [24] to synthesize GO with different degrees of oxidation. We controlled the extent of oxidation of GO by adjusting the amount of oxidant instead of the oxidation times because of the fast reaction rate between graphite and KMnO4. The characteristics of the GOs and corresponding exfoliated GONSs were investigated, some interesting phenomena that different from previous reports were observed. Secondly, to demonstrate the practical significance of the less oxidized GONS in polymer composites, we evaluated and compared the mechanical reinforcement effect of different GONSs on polymer composites by using PVA as a model polymer, the experimental results were further evaluated by the Halpin–Tsai model."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Graphite powder (∼100 mesh, 99.9995%) was obtained from Alfa-aesar Co. Ltd. Concentrated sulfuric acid (95–98%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), and concentrated hydrochloric acid were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (SCRC), and used as received. PVA with repeat unit numbers of 2400–2500 (PVA 124; hydrolysis degree, 98–99%) was purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Preparation of GOs with different degrees of oxidation,"2.2 Preparation of GOs with different degrees of oxidation GOs were prepared as follow: first, 0.5g graphite was dispersed in 50ml concentrated sulfuric acid and stirred for 30min, then cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. Then, different amount of KMnO4 (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5g) was slowly added to the mixture, and elevated the temperature to 35°C, maintained for 1h. After that, the temperature was gradually raised up to 70°C and maintained for another 1h. The method used by Kosynkin et al. was applied to determine if the reaction were complete [25]. However, for the reaction of graphite with 300wt% KMnO4, it was found that there was still KMnO4 remained even after reaction at 70°C for 1h, therefore, for this sample, the reaction was not complete. After reaction, the mixtures were poured into 500mL deionized water that contained 3mL of H2O2. The dispersions were centrifuged and extensively washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (10%) and deionized water, then dried in vacuo at 60°C."
4,Fabrication of GONS/PVA composites,"2.3 Fabrication of GONS/PVA composites The typical procedure for the fabrication of composites was as follow: 100mg GO was first dispersed in 100mL water and sonicated for 1h. Then the dispersion was subjected to centrifugation at 4000rpm for 30min to remove the un-exfoliated particles, the sediments were dried and weighed to calculate the concentration of the GONS dispersions. Then required amount of the GONS dispersion was mixed with PVA solutions, and stirred overnight. After that, the homogeneous mixture was poured into a plastic dish and dried at 60°C until the weight became equilibrate."

The tensile property of GONS papers was measured with an Instron 4465 instrument at room temperature with a humidity of about 50% at a crosshead speed of 0.05mm/min, and the initial gauge length and width were 15mm and 3mm. For tensile test of composites, the crosshead speed was 5mm/min, and the initial gauge length and width were 40mm and 4mm. The conductivity of GONS papers were measured by a four-probe method. The degree of crystallinity of composite was measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), model 6200 (Seiko, Japan)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis and characterization of GOs with different degrees of oxidation,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of GOs with different degrees of oxidation Controlled oxidation by modulating the oxidant amount has been previously used by several groups [25,26], including ours [27], to longitudinally unzip multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The degree of oxidation and unzipping of the MWCNTs varied with different amount of KMnO4. Therefore, it is rational to speculate that the same method can also be used to tailor the characteristics of GO. Because the reinforcement effect is not only related to the quality, but also the aspect ratio of GONS, while these parameters are strongly dependent on the degree of oxidation, so we set the dosage of oxidant as 100, 200 and 300% the weight of graphite to investigate how the extent of oxidation influences the quality and aspect ratio of GONS, and how the combination of structural quality and aspect ratio influences the reinforcement effect of GONS to polymers. The corresponding GOs are defined as GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3. The maximum amount of KMnO4 is 3 times the weight of graphite, because 300wt% KMnO4 is enough to ensure the sufficient oxidation of graphite [24]. We have also tried to minimize the amount of oxidant to 50wt% of the graphite, but we found the obtained GO could hardly be exfoliated in water. Different from previously used modified Hummers’ method, in which the reaction temperature was always fixed at 35°C [24], we elevated the reaction temperature in two steps in this study: first, set the reaction temperature at 35°C and maintained for 1h to consume most of the oxidant; second, heated the slurry to 70°C and maintained for another 1h to completely consume the oxidant. In this manner, we can directly correlate the degree of oxidation of GO with the amount of oxidant. Moreover, it is more controllable and reproducible to prepare the same sample in different batch if we strictly controlled the dosage of oxidant. However, we found that even in this reaction condition, the oxidant in preparation process of GO-3 could not be completely consumed, confirming that 300wt% oxidant is indeed enough to fully oxidize the graphite. Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR spectra, Raman spectra and XRD patterns of graphite and GOs. As expected, the extent of oxidation and lattice distortion increased with increasing the oxidant amount. As revealed by the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1(a)), the peak intensities of oxygen-containing groups in GOs, including C–O and C–O–C groups (950–1300cm−1), and CO (carbonyl and carboxyl) groups (1720cm−1), become stronger with more oxidant, suggesting more functional groups are generated. Moreover, the gradually increased peak intensity of CO groups from GO-1 to GO-3, can be served as a hint that more cracks induced by oxidation are formed in GO with higher level of oxidation, because it was demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the CO groups were mainly attached on the edges of GONS in previous studies [28,29]. Raman spectra (Fig. 1(b)) show D band, an indication of disorder, at around 1330cm−1, and G band at around 1580cm−1, in all GO samples, confirming the formation of structural defects. Moreover, the D/G intensity ratio increases from 1.03 for GO-1, to 1.13 for GO-2, and 1.25 for GO-3, suggesting more structural damages or functional groups are introduced in GO with higher extent of oxidation. XRD results (Fig. 1(c)) also support the same order of overall oxidation. The GO-1 shows two peaks, one belonging to GO structure appears at 13.1°, corresponding to d-spacing of 0.68nm, and the other is at a position close to the 002 reflection peak of graphite (2θ =26.4°), which is attributed to the diffraction of un-oxidized graphite. However, the peak of un-oxidized graphite becomes very small in GO-2, indicating the GO-2 is nearly fully oxidized, and 200wt% KMnO4 might be enough to prepare well exfoliated GONS. The peak assigned to the GO structure slightly shifts to 12.3°, corresponding to d-spacing of 0.72nm, suggesting more oxygen groups are penetrated into the interlayer. In GO-3, as a result of complete oxidation, the peak arose from GO structure appears at 11.7°, corresponding to d-spacing of 0.76nm, and the peak at position of 26.4° is disappeared. To elucidate the extent of oxidation of GO more quantitatively, we analyzed the XPS spectra, and the high resolution C1s spectra of GO samples, as shown in Fig. 2 . The C/O atomic ratios of GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3 are 3.68, 3.06 and 2.31, respectively, which is in agreement with the order of oxidation characterized by other methods. Notably, the C/O ratio of GO-1 is even comparable to some reported reduced GO [30,31]. Moreover, XPS can also provide important information on the surface functionalities of GO, although it is not strictly precise. Fig. 2(b–d) shows that the high resolution C1s spectra of GO samples can all be fitted into four peaks, the peaks at about 284.8–285.1eV are attributed to the components of CC/C–C groups, the components assigned to C–O (hydroxyl and epoxy) groups are located at 286.7–287.2eV, the peaks corresponding to CO groups are at the position of 287.8–288.2eV, and the components of O–C–OH are at the position of 289.3–289.5eV [32,33]. The oxygen-containing groups increase with increased oxidation, and the observation that CO and O–C–OH groups gradually increase from GO-1 to GO-3 suggests more oxidative cracks have been generated with more oxidant [29], which is consistent with the FT-IR characterizations. The oxidation can not only alter the composition and physiochemical property, but also the morphology of graphite. Therefore we used SEM to investigate the GOs, with the aim of giving visual evidences on how the oxidation affected the morphology of GO. The SEM images of graphite and GOs are shown in Fig. 3 . The graphite (Fig. 3(a)) displays a typical laminated structure, and the layers of graphite are arranged in order. Interestingly, GO-1 shows a similar morphology to graphite, suggesting the mild oxidation has not destroyed the ordered structure of graphite too much. However, the occasionally observed curved cloth-like sheets, as labeled in the rectangular area in Fig. 3(b), indicating the outer layers of graphite has been oxidative delaminated, while the inner layers is less or not oxidized. The GO-2 appears a paper-like morphology in the SEM image, which may result from the sequential oxidative delamination of the graphite, and the face-to-face restacking of the delaminated GO sheets during the washing and drying process. However, it seems that the structural destruction is more serious in GO-3, because the graphite is broken into small pieces and lost the long range ordering, therefore, the GO-3 looks like agglomerates rather than thin plates after drying. The SEM characterizations also confirm that the damages of graphite caused by oxidation increase with increasing the degree of oxidation, which is in conformity with the Raman characterizations."
8,Exfoliation and characterization of GONSs,"3.2 Exfoliation and characterization of GONSs For most applications, in order to fully exploit the unique properties of graphene based materials, the GO must be exfoliated in single-layered or few-layered sheets. The exfoliation behavior of GO should largely affect its performance in some applications, such as polymer composites. Therefore, we have tried to exfoliate different GOs in water. After sonication of the aqueous solutions of GOs (1mg/ml) for 1h, the solutions were subjected to centrifugation at 4000rpm for 30min to remove the un-exfoliated particles. After carefully weighing the dried precipitates, we found the exfoliation rates of GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3 were about 40%, 90% and 100%, respectively. Note that the exfoliation rate of the less oxidized GO-1 is still much higher than that of pristine graphite in organic or water/surfactant solutions [34,35]. The results also suggest that 200wt% KMnO4 could nearly fully oxidize the graphite, which is consistent with the XRD results. The dilute solutions (0.1mg/ml) of the corresponding GONSs are shown in Fig. 4 (a). From the picture, it can be clearly seen that the color of GONS-1 is much darker than that of GONS-2 and GONS-3, implying a better preserved electronic conjugation [36]. UV–vis spectra of the different GONS solutions are shown in Fig. 4(b). Interestingly, the spectrum of our GONS-1 exhibits a main absorption peak at 265nm, a position very close to the absorption peak of pristine graphene [37], and a shoulder at about 230nm belonging to the characteristic peak of GO [38], suggesting the GONS-1 is dominated by sp2 areas, and the oxidation condition we used has not introduced large area of damages to the basal plane of GONS-1. For GONS-2, the peak at 230nm increases, suggesting the oxidized domain in the GONS-2 is larger than that in GONS-1. However, the peak at 265nm still remains in the GONS-2, indicating there are still significant sp2 areas in the GONS-2. This observation also suggests that by properly controlling the amount of oxidant, the graphite could be fully oxidized and exfoliated while preserved from strong damages. The GONS-3 shows a main peak at 230nm, and a shoulder at 300nm, which is identical to previously reported fully oxidized GO. Therefore, the UV–vis characterizations demonstrate that the GONS-1 has larger π-conjugated domains as a result of the less oxidation, which is important for some applications related to its electronic properties. We further used TEM and Raman spectroscopy to investigate the morphologies and structures of GONSs. As shown in Fig. 5 , the GONS-1 (Fig. 5(a)) displays a relatively smooth surface, suggesting little damages have been introduced into the plane of GONS-1, which is in sharp contrast to GONS-2 (Fig. 5(b)) and GONS-3 (Fig. 5(c)). In GONS-2, there are many linear wrinkles that are attributed to the defects caused by oxidation across the whole surface [39], which is a common feature of GONS. The oxidation induced defects are much more in GONS-3, because the distortion of the graphene lattice is more serious, and some small holes are even existed in this sample. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of all the GONSs display the sixfold-symmetry diffraction patterns, suggesting the hexagonal symmetry of the graphene is maintained, or at least partially preserved in our GONSs with various degree of oxidation [40]. Raman characterizations reveal that the ID/IG values of GONS-1, GONS-2 and GONS-3 are 1.10, 1.15 and 1.26, respectively, following well with the level of oxidation of GO-1, GO-2 and GO-3, and are also consistent with the UV–vis and TEM characterizations. To quantitatively investigate the degree of exfoliation of different GOs, AFM characterization was applied. The typical tapping-mode AFM images and height profiles of GONSs deposited on mica substrate are shown in Fig. 6 , and the statistics of height calculated from a large number (100 pieces) of sheets of each samples are also presented. Based on the height statistical analysis, it is found that the GONS-1 has an average thickness of about 2nm, corresponding to 3–4 layers, while the mean thicknesses of GONS-2 and GONS-3 are about 1nm, corresponding to single layer [36]. We again attributed the obtained few-layered GONS-1 to the incomplete oxidation of GO-1. The sizes and shapes of GONSs have also attracted our attention, because we note that there are many strip-shape sheets in GONS-1. Besides, although the shapes of GONS-2 and GONS-3 are more isotropic as compared to GONS-1 in the planar direction, the average size of GONS-3 seems much smaller than that of GONS-2. Therefore, we also calculated the lengths and widths of the three samples based on AFM analysis, about 100 pieces of sheets were counted for each sample. The statistics of lengths and widths of the three GONSs are showed in Fig. 7 , from which we can see that the average length of GONS-1 is about 500–600nm, and the average width is about 200nm, indicating a more anisotropic nature. However, the mechanism of the formation of strips in GONS-1 is not clear at present. In GONS-2, the average length and width are all about 500–700nm, while for GONS-3, these values are all below 200nm, suggesting the GONS-3 has been broken into small pieces due to the excessive oxidation. Since the structural qualities of GONSs can be reflected by the macroscopic properties of their two-dimensional assembled papers, we have also investigated the mechanical or electrical properties of GONS papers and reduced GONS (RGONS) papers. The GONS papers were fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration of the aqueous dispersions of GONSs [41], the good exfoliation and dispersion state of GONSs guaranteed the uniformity of the resultant papers, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). The SEM images of fracture surfaces of the three GONS papers show typical laminated morphology of graphene papers, demonstrating the well-packed layered structures (Fig. 8(b)). The RGONS papers were prepared by immersing the GONS papers in a mixture of hydriodic acid and acetic acid with a volume ratio of 2/5 at 40°C for 24h to partially remove the oxygen-containing groups [32], then washed with sodium bicarbonate solution and subsequently annealed at 220°C for 2h to decompose the residual functionalities [42]. After reduction, the RGONS-1 paper remains its integrity with relatively smooth surface, while the RGONS-2 and RGONS-3 papers become inhomogeneous with some crumples across the surfaces (Fig. 8(a)). The SEM images also indicate the delamination of RGONS-2 and RGONS-3 papers, because some cavities are found in the fracture surfaces, suggesting the gases generated by the decomposition of functional groups have destroyed the integrity of the papers with higher level of oxidation (Fig. 8(b)). These results suggest our less oxidized GONS can be served as a good precursor for preparation of free-standing and integrated graphene paper. TGA characterizations were performed to confirm the reduction of GONS papers. The weight losses of GONS papers are mainly occurred at the temperature between 150 to 350°C (Fig. 8(c)). In this range, the weight loss of GONS-1, GONS-2 and GONS-3 papers are 22.5%, 38.1% and 48.5%, respectively. After reduction, the weight loss of RGONS-1, RGONS-2 and RGONS-3 papers decrease to 2.7%, 3.9% and 7.2%, respectively. Such results demonstrate the efficient reduction of GONS papers. Fig. 8(e) shows the mechanical properties of GONS papers. For each sample, three strips were measured and the results were averaged. The modulus and strength of GONS-1 paper are 9.6GPa and 59.2MPa, respectively. As the oxidation of GONS paper increases, the modulus and strength increase to 14.1GPa and 94.2MPa for GONS-2 paper, this is reasonable, because the mechanical properties of GONS paper are mainly determined by the hydrogen-bonding network that formed between oxygen-containing groups and intercalated water molecules [43,44]. The GONS-2 paper has more oxygen-containing groups than GONS-1, therefore, the mechanical properties of GONS-2 paper is better than GONS-1 paper. For GONS-3 paper, the modulus and strength decrease to 11.4GPa and 44.9MPa, which may be due to the much smaller sizes of GONS-3. However, the conductivity of GONS-1 paper is 2–3 order of magnitude higher than those of GONS-2 and GONS-3 papers. For instance, the conductivity of GONS-1, GONS-2 and GONS-3 papers are 2.7×10−3, 4.4×10−5, and 1.5×10−6 S/cm, respectively. After reduction, the conductivities of papers dramatically increase by 5–7 order of magnitude, suggesting the efficient reduction of GONS papers. Significantly, the conductivity of RGONS-1 paper is approached a reasonably high value of 315S/cm, which is among the highest conductivities of reduced GONS [45]. In contrast, the conductivity of RGONS-2 and RGONS-3 papers are 144 and 69S/cm, respectively. The much higher conductivity of GONS-1 and RGONS-1 papers are consistent with previous characterizations that the less oxidized GONS-1 possesses fewer structural defects in the basal plane, and suggests that the GONS-1 should be a better reinforcement agent for polymer composites. Although the aim of this work is not to investigate the reduced GONS or exploit the electrical properties of GONS-1 and RGONS-1, the results presented here are expected to facilitate the preparation of highly conductive graphene-based materials."
9,Preparation and characterization of GONS/PVA composites,"3.3 Preparation and characterization of GONS/PVA composites For efficient reinforcement of polymers by incorporation of graphene, several critical issues should be considered, such as the homogeneous dispersion of graphene in the matrix, the strong interfacial interactions between graphene and the matrix, and the intrinsic properties of the graphene [7–9]. To date, many successes have been achieved in respect to the first two aspects thanks to the processibility and functionalability of GONS. However, the reinforcement effect could be compromised by the large quantity of defects presented in the basal planes. The use of less oxidized GONS could offer a potential pathway to address this issue. To test if the less oxidized GONS could provide better reinforcement effect, we compared the performances of the three GONSs fabricated in this study in reinforcement of polymers. It is noteworthy that because the GONS-2 was nearly but not fully oxidized, and completely exfoliated into single-layered sheets, therefore, the performance of GONS-2 in polymer composites should comparable or even better than traditionally used fully oxidized single-layered GONS, while the GONS-3 should represent an excessively oxidized sample. PVA was chosen as a model polymer because its water solubility and the strong interactions with GONS [10,11]. The composites were fabricated by a simple solution-blending method, the contents of fillers in all the composites were fixed at 0.2wt%. The relatively low weight fraction of filler was selected to ensure the uniform dispersion of GONS in the matrix. SEM images can provide direct visual evidence of the dispersion state of the composites, as shown in Fig. 9 . Similar to the morphologies of GONS/PVA composites in the literatures [46,47], the GONSs in the PVA matrix are homogeneously distributed and tend to align parallel to the film surface in this study, such observation was always attributed to the strong interactions between PVA and GONS, and the two-dimensional nature of GONS. However, the fracture surface of GONS-2/PVA seems rougher than that of GONS-1/PVA, this is because the smaller thickness of GONS-2 could generate more surface areas. In GONS-3/PVA, due to the much smaller sizes of GONS-3, less sheets could be observed. Tensile test was employed to evaluate the reinforcement effect of different GONSs. For accuracy, at least four strips were tested for each samples. The typical stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 10 (a), and the average modulus and tensile stress are compared in Fig. 10(b). The modulus and tensile stress of pure PVA are 4.25GPa and 98.4MPa, which were slightly higher than our previous reported values [27]. The GONS-1 shows the best results in terms of improving the modulus and tensile stress of the matrix. The modulus and tensile stress of GONS-1/PVA are 5.94GPa and 127.4MPa, corresponding to improvements of 39.8% and 29.5%, respectively. These values for GONS-2/PVA are 5.17GPa and 117.3MPa, corresponding to increases of 21.6% and 19.2%, respectively. However, for GONS-3/PVA, the increments in modulus and tensile stress are only 12.3% and 11.8%. The elongation at break of all the composites are about 50–60%, suggesting the low content of filler could not deteriorate the ductile of PVA. These results clearly demonstrate the better reinforcement effect of the GONS-1. As PVA is a semi-crystalline polymer, the degree of crystallinity could strongly influence the mechanical properties. Therefore, we performed DSC analysis to investigate the crystallinities of the composites [27]. The DSC curves of the composites are shown in Fig. 11 , and the calculated crystallinities are labeled in the figure. The DSC analysis suggests that the incorporation of all types of GONSs could lower the crystallinity of PVA, which is similar to previous studies conducted by others [46,48]. The decreased crytallinity is also attributed to the strong interactions between GONS and the polymer chains, which could lower the inter-chains interactions of the polymer matrix. The results suggest that the increased mechanical properties are mainly due to the reinforcement of the GONSs. As shown, although the aspect ratio of GONS-1 is smaller than that of GONS-2, the GONS-1 still shows better reinforcement effect than GONS-2. We attributed this observation to the higher quality of the less oxidized GONS-1. The intrinsic mechanical property of GONS-1 should be the best among all the GONSs because of its lowest degree of oxidation. In addition, Suk et al. have directly measured the mechanical properties of GONS with different number of layers. They found that the modulus of monolayer GONS was about 200GPa, while for three-layer GONS with the same extent of oxidation, this value was about 700GPa [49]. In our study, the GONS-1 is not only with much less defects, but also possesses 3–4 layers, therefore, its mechanical property should be even better. To probe if our experimental results were reasonable, we used Halpin–Tsai model to predict the modulus of our composites. Because the aspect ratio of GONS-3 was the smallest and the degree of oxidation is the highest, we only compared the reinforcement effect of GONS-1 and GONS-2. The Halpin–Tsai model we used is given in the following Eqs. (1)–(4) [10,50]: (1) E 3 D = 3 8 1 + ( 2 L G / 3 T G ) η L V G 1 - η L V G + 5 8 1 + 2 η T V G 1 - η T V G E PVA (2) E 2 D = 1 + ( 2 L G / 3 T G ) η L V G 1 - η L V G E PVA (3) η L = ( E G / E PVA ) - 1 E G / E PVA + 2 L G / 3 T G (4) η T = ( E G / E PVA ) - 1 E G / E PVA + 2 where E3D and E2D are modulus of composites with randomly and uniaxially distributed GONS. EG and EPVA are tensile modulus of GONS and PVA. LG , TG , and VG refer to the length, thickness, and volume fraction of GONS in the composites, respectively. The densities of GONS and PVA are 2.2 and 1.3g/cm3, respectively. The average length and thickness for GONS-1 are about 550 and 2nm. For GONS-2, these values are about 650 and 1nm. The modulus of GONS-1 and GONS-2 are selected as 700GPa and 200GPa based on the previous work [49], while the modulus of PVA is 4.25GPa from the experimental results. Note that the modulus of our GONS-1 should be higher than the reported value because of the lower degree of oxidation as compared to fully oxidized three-layered GONS [49]. The calculated values of E3D and E2D are compared to the experimental results, as shown in Fig. 12 . It is found that the calculated values finely support our experimental results that the GONS-1 shows better reinforcement effect than the GONS-2. However, the calculated modulus is lower than the experimental value, which was also observed in previous reports [51–53]. It is thought that two reasons are accounted for this phenomena in our study. Firstly, the modulus of GONS we used for simulation is lower than the real modulus because of the lower degree of oxidation of our GONS. Secondly, the strong interactions between the GONS and PVA could cause a substantial interphase zone, the adsorbed polymer chains confined in this area have different conformation and viscoelasticity as compared to the bulk polymers, and the length scale of this confinement effect can be up to tens of nanometers to several hundreds of nanometers [54]. Moreover, these interfacial layers also have a significantly higher modulus than the bulk polymers. Therefore, the efficient volume fraction of the filler is usually much higher than the real volume fraction of the nanofillers [52,53]. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that by lowering the degree of oxidation of GO, high-quality GONS that have better reinforcement effect to polymers can be fabricated. Moreover, we can imagine that if we could further optimize the aspect ratio of the less oxidized GONS, even better results could be obtained."
10,Conclusions,"GOs with different degrees of oxidation were fabricated by treating graphite with different amounts of oxidant. FT-IR, Raman, XRD, XPS and SEM measurements revealed that the surface functional groups and structural defects increased with increasing the amount of oxidant. The exfoliation behaviors of the GOs and the corresponding GONSs were also investigated. It was found that the less oxidized GONS-1, which was reacted with 100wt% amount of oxidant, could be exfoliated in aqueous solution with an exfoliation rate of 40%, while 200wt% amount of oxidant could nearly fully oxidize the graphite. AFM revealed that the average thickness of GONS-1 was about 2nm, corresponding to 3–4 layers, while most of the GONS-2 were single-layers. UV–vis, TEM, Raman and electrical conductivity characterizations also demonstrated the relatively higher quality of GONS-1. The reinforcement effect of different GONSs to polymer composites were evaluated by using PVA as a model polymer. The results demonstrated the better reinforcement effect of the less oxidized GONS-1 as compared to the nearly fully oxidized single-layered GONS-2. It is expected that this study could provide an alternative, or as a balance between previously used poorly processible and surface-inert pristine graphene and defect-rich fully oxidized graphene oxide for polymer composites."
