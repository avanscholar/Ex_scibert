0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is currently regarded for mid-term as a promising energy vector in both transport and power generation sectors. Hydrogen is a versatile and efficient fuel, which undergoes a clean combustion since water is the only product generated. Nowadays, most hydrogen is currently produced by steam reforming of methane, which is accompanied by large emissions of CO2. Thus, all the carbon contained in the raw methane ends up as CO2, formed and released in the hydrogen production plant. A different approach is the production of hydrogen by catalytic decomposition of methane, which has become an attractive alternative for hydrogen production. In this process, methane is transformed into solid carbon and hydrogen, which implies that it is free of CO/CO2 emissions, while moderate energy consumptions are required [1,2]. The presence of catalysts allows excessively high temperatures to be avoided in contrast with the thermal methane decomposition, which requires values over 1200°C. Metal catalysts exhibit the highest activities in methane decomposition, but they present the disadvantage of being rapidly deactivated by the carbon deposits generated as co-product of methane decomposition [3,4]. Furthermore, regeneration of metal catalysts by burning those carbon deposits is not a valid option since it would lead to undesirable CO2 emissions. Alternatively, the use of carbonaceous materials as catalysts for methane decomposition reaction is being extensively explored. The most remarkable advantages of carbon catalysts are as follows: a) high thermal stability; b) strong resistance to deactivation by either poisons present in the feedstock or by carbon deposits; c) regeneration step is not needed; d) the reaction could become autocatalytic, and e) the co-produced carbon might be more easily marketable [5–8]. Numerous types of carbonaceous materials have been tested in recent years as catalysts for methane decomposition [5–12]. Although the reaction mechanism is not completely elucidated yet, it its clear that the catalytic performance of carbons is mostly determined by their crystallinity and surface properties. Thus, amorphous carbons are more active catalysts than crystalline ones, this fact being attributed to a higher amount of surface active sites on the formers. On the other hand, those carbons having a high external surface area and/or mesoporosity offer a higher accessibility to the methane molecules and usually exhibit a higher resistance to deactivation by carbon deposits. In a recent work, we have reported preliminary results about the use of ordered mesoporous carbons as catalysts in this reaction. In particular, two carbon materials belonging to the CMK family [13] have shown to be highly active catalysts for hydrogen production via methane decomposition reaction [14]. The best results were obtained over the CMK-5 type carbon, characterized by having high surface area and a double mesopore system. In this work, we report in more detail a comparative study of the catalytic properties corresponding to CMK-type carbons and samples of the most representative commercial carbons usually employed as catalysts in the methane decomposition reaction for hydrogen production. Thereby, a CMK-5 material has been compared with carbon black, microporous activated carbon and mesoporous activated carbon samples."
1,Experimental,"CMK-3 and CMK-5 carbons were synthesized using a nanocasting pathway with pure silica SBA-15 as hard-template, following the procedure reported in literature [15]. Accordingly, the structure of CMK carbons is the replica of that corresponding to SBA-15. For SBA-15 preparation, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich) and a non-ionic triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123, Aldrich) were used as silica source and as structure directing agent, respectively. Firstly, 4g of Pluronic P123 were dissolved in a mixture containing the following composition: 0.041mol TEOS : 6.67mol H2O : 0.24mol HCl. Subsequently, the solution was subjected to hydrolysis–condensation reaction at 40°C for 6h and hydrothermal treatment at 90°C during 3 days. Finally, the filtrated solids were calcined at 550°C during 6h under static air. For the synthesis of CMK carbons, furfuryl alcohol (FA, Acros Organics) was used as precursor, oxalic acid (OA, Acros Organics) as polymerization catalyst and trimethylbenzene (TMB, Aldrich) as solvent. In a typical synthesis, the pores of SBA-15 were filled with a solution containing 0.012g OA/3mLFA in TMB by the wetness impregnation technique. Afterwards, the carbon precursor was polymerized within the SBA-15 pores by heat treatment at 50°C for 1 day and, then, at 90°C for 2 days. Carbonization was then performed under inert atmosphere using the following temperature program: a) 150°C for 3h; b) heating to 300°C at 1°C/min; c) heating to 850°C at 5°C/min, and d) isothermal for 3h. Finally, the silica template was removed by dissolution with an ethanol–water mixture containing 1M NaOH. The black powders were then filtrated, washed and dried at 90°C overnight. CMK-3 sample was obtained by using pure FA in the infiltration solution, while for CMK-5 preparation a solution containing 50% FA in TMB was used. As a consequence, in this case the pores in SBA-15 are not completely filled by the carbon precursor. For comparison purposes, three commercial carbons were used as reference materials: microporous activated carbon (AC-mic, Merck), mesoporous activated carbon (AC-mes, Darko) and carbon black (black pearls 2000, CB-bp, Cabot Corp.). Carbon catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption analyses (77K) using a Micrometrics Tristar 3000 sorptometer. Samples were previously degassed at 200°C under nitrogen flow. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) equation was applied for surface area determination. Pore size distribution of mesoporous carbons was calculated using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Philips X'PERT MPD diffractometer operating with CuKα radiation. A Philips Technai 20 Transmission Electron Microscope, operating with a tungsten filament working at 200kV, was used to obtain micro-images. Methane decomposition reactions were performed on a simultaneous DSC-TGA thermobalance (SDT 2960, TA instruments). A flow of 100mlmin−1 of 10 % CH4 in Ar was employed as reactive gas. The gas is fed horizontally over the cylindrical pan that contains the catalyst sample. Previous experiments were performed varying the gas flow rate in order to ensure that the process is not controlled by the external diffusion step. The amount of catalyst initially loaded in the thermobalance varied in the range 3–11mg, depending on the expected activity for each sample. Reactions were operated under both temperature programmed and isothermal conditions. Prior to the reactions, carbon catalysts were dried at 250°C under nitrogen flow. Hydrogen production was indirectly measured through the weight increase of the catalyst due to the carbon deposition, according to the stoichiometry of the reaction: (1) CH4(g)→2H2(g)+C(s)"
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the N2 (77K) physisorption isotherms of the commercial carbons. The isotherm of AC-mic is type I, typical of microporous materials, as denoted by the strong adsorption present at low relative pressures. In the case, of the AC-mes sample the isotherm shows significant adsorption at intermediate relative pressures, which is consistent with the presence of mesopores in this material. Nevertheless, it presents also an important adsorption at low relative pressures, indicating that this sample contains micropores. Therefore, the AC-mes sample exhibits a bimodal micro-meso-porosity. Likewise, the isotherm of CB-bp exhibits a complex shape, with significant adsorption at both low and high relative pressures. As indicated in a previous work, this fact is consistent with this material being formed by microporous nanoparticles. The adsorption in the micropores corresponds to the first step in the isotherm observed at low relative pressures, while the interparticle voids are responsible of the strong adsorption occurring at high relative pressures. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of CMK-3 and CMK-5 samples are illustrated in Fig. 2 A. Likewise, their corresponding mesopore size distributions, estimated by application of the BJH model to the adsorption branch of the isotherm, are shown in Fig. 2 B. Both samples exhibit type IV isotherms, denoting clearly the presence of mesoporosity. CMK-3 shows a single adsorption step featured by an inflection point at a relative pressure about 0.30, which indicates that this material is formed by just one type of mesopores. In contrast, two steps can be observed for the CMK-5 sample. Thus, in addition to the main step with inflection point at a relative pressure about 0.30, a second adsorption step occurs at higher relative pressures (c.a. 0.65). From the BJH pore size distribution (Fig. 2 B), it can be clearly seen that both CMK samples have in common a pore system of 3nm diameter size. This porosity corresponds to the cavities generated by the removal of the silica template. Accordingly, these mesopores are a replica of the silica walls in SBA-15, which implies that their size is determined by the width of the latter. Interestingly, a second type of mesopores, located at 5.8nm, appears for CMK-5. This additional mesoporosity is due to the partial filling of the SBA-15 pores with the carbon precursor during the CMK-5 preparation. In this case, the size of these mesopores is determined by the diameters of the mesopores in SBA-15, although having a smaller size due to the partial filling, polymerization and carbonization of the carbon precursor. Fig. 3 illustrates the structure of the CMK-3 and CMK-5 carbons, which are the replica of that corresponding to the raw SBA-15. It can be seen that while CMK-3 is formed by carbon nanorods, CMK-5 consists of hollow carbon nanotubes. In both materials, the cylindrical carbon nanostructures are linked through small lateral carbon bars, which impart stability to the whole structure. These bars are originated by the micropores present within the walls in SBA-15 connecting the mesopores. Table 1 summarizes the textural properties of the different carbons determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms. All the carbon samples exhibit BET areas higher than 1000m2 g−1, the CMK-5 material presenting the highest value (close to 2000m2 g−1). Application of the t-plot method to the N2 isotherms confirms that most of the surface area in the AC-mic sample is associated to micropores. Likewise, a high contribution of the micropores to the overall surface area is observed for the CB-bp material, although it possesses a significant external surface area as it is formed by nanoparticles. In the case of the AC-mes sample, the presence of microporosity is also detected while the main contribution to the BET surface area is due to the presence of mesoporosity. According to the BJH model, the AC-mes sample possesses a wide pore size distribution in the mesopore range (20–80Å). In contrast, CMK samples are free of any discernible microporosity in agreement with their purely mesoporous nature. Low-angle XRD patterns of CMK carbons are depicted in Fig. 4 , together with that of the SBA-15 template. The appearance of (100), (110) and (200) reflections, typical of ordered mesostructures with 2-D porous hexagonal symmetry (p6mm), confirms that replication of the SBA-15 pore structure was succeeded. Therefore, both CMK samples can be considered as ordered mesoporous carbons. The wide-angle XRD patterns corresponding to the different carbon samples are shown in Fig. 5 . All patterns show the (002) and (101) reflections, corresponding to the graphite structure. The broadness of these reflections indicates that both commercial and CMK carbons must be considered as essentially amorphous materials, with just small domains of graphitic crystallites. The (002) reflection shifts to lower angles for the carbon black and the CMK carbons, which indicates a higher curvature of the graphene layers, as typical of turbostratic carbons [16,17]. CB-bp and CMK-5 were also characterized by TEM, some representative images being displayed in Fig. 6 . Carbon black CB-bp is formed by aggregates of nanoparticles. The average size of the latter is around 20nm, which accounts for the existence of an important fraction of external surface area and interparticle porosity, as above concluded from the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. Higher magnifications of the TEM images confirm the presence in this sample of a disordered structure, also revealed by wide-angle XRD analysis, with just small domains of graphene layers. On the other hand, CMK-5 particles exhibit much larger dimensions and the typical morphology of SBA-15 particles, showing that they have also replicated the shape of the particles in the raw silica. When enlarging the CMK-5 TEM images, a high mesoscopic order with a hexagonal pore array may be clearly observed. Moreover, by means of EDX analyses the high purity of such particles was determined with only traces of silica being detected. The catalytic properties of both commercial and CMK carbons in methane decomposition were evaluated by thermogravimetric measurements using the installation and conditions described in the experimental section. In all cases, the carbon deposits formed from methane decomposition were located within the thermobalance pan covering the catalyst particles. No carbon deposits were observed in any other part of the thermobalance, neither in the outer of the pan. These facts are a clear indication of the absence of an homogenous process of methane decomposition, whereas no catalytic effect can be attributed to the pan material (alumina). Fig. 7 compares the evolution of the carbon formed from the reaction, and deposited on the catalysts, corresponding to the five carbon catalysts under temperature programmed conditions, referred to the initial catalyst weight (W/W0). In addition, Table 2 shows the hydrogen production normalized to the initial mass of catalyst at the end of each reaction as well as the estimated threshold temperature of the reaction (TTh). This last parameter was estimated as the temperature at which a 0.5 % weight increase of the initial catalyst weight occurred due to carbon deposition. It is remarkable that CMK-3 and CMK-5 carbons become active at temperatures between 25 and 35°C lower than those corresponding to CB-bp and AC-mic (778 and 779°C, respectively). In this way, it must be pointed out that CB-bp was one of the most active carbon catalysts in methane decomposition so far reported [6,7]. On the other hand, AC-mes shows a very low threshold temperature, denoting the high initial catalytic activity of this material for methane decomposition. Concerning the catalyst stability, it is observed that the AC-mic sample becomes rapidly deactivated, reaching just a small weight increase and hydrogen production at the end of the experiment, due to the blockage of its microporosity by the carbon deposition from methane decomposition. In the case of the AC-mes sample, the catalytic activity is clearly higher than that of the AC-mic, indicating the positive effect derived from the presence of the mesopores, although the hydrogen production is clearly below the values corresponding to CB-bp and CMK materials. As it is observed in Table 2, the carbon black sample leads to a hydrogen production just slightly higher than that of CMK-3 but clearly lower than the value obtained with CMK-5. This material presents the highest activity, with a total production close to 1mol of hydrogen per gram of catalyst along the duration of the experiment. The catalytic activity and resistance of the catalysts have been also compared under isothermal conditions in order to isolate the effect of the temperature and time. Fig. 8 A represents the evolution of carbon deposition observed with the different catalysts in experiments carried out at 950°C for 24h. Again the AC-mic sample becomes very fast deactivated due to its micropore nature. A similar behavior is observed for the AC-mes sample, although it may afford the deposition of larger carbon amounts before being deactivated. This fact is probably related to the presence in this material of mesopores and a higher pore volume compared to the AC-mic sample. In the case of the CB-bp carbon a significant change in the slope of the curve is observed after 8h of reaction, suggesting that it also undergoes deactivation. For the CMK samples, after a sharp initial change in the slope that takes place at short reaction times, the carbon deposition rate remains almost constant, indicating that these materials exhibit a high resistance to deactivation. In a second series of experiments, the catalysts exhibiting the highest activity (CMK-5 and CB-bp) were compared under more severe conditions by increasing the reaction temperature up to 1000°C and extending the reaction time. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 8 B. In this case, CB-bp is also strongly affected by the carbon deposition, suffering a sharp decrease of the catalytic activity for reaction times longer than 4h. Under those conditions, the CB-bp sample is almost completely deactivated, the weight increase curve reaching a plateau for a carbon deposition of 5g per g of raw catalyst. In the case of the CMK-5 sample, after the sharp change above commented in the curve slope that occurs at short times, the catalysts keeps a high activity with an almost linear rate of carbon deposition. As a consequence, in this experiment is evident that the CMK-5 material is quite more active than the CB-bp sample. The reaction rate in the experiment at 1000°C has been estimated as an average for the first 20 minutes of reaction and expressed as hydrogen production per gram of catalyst and per hour. The hydrogen production rates so obtained for CB-bp is 0.189molH2 g−1 cat h−1, whereas for CMK-5 this parameter has a value of 0.599molH2 g−1 cat h−1, confirming that CMK-5 exhibits a quite higher catalytic activity. Likewise, it must be remarked that after 72h of reaction around 25 grams of carbon have been deposited per gram of CMK-5 catalyst. Interestingly, in spite of so huge amount of carbon deposited, the CMK-5 material still retains a remarkable catalytic activity. The amount of carbon deposited at the end of this experiment is quite superior to that corresponding to the complete filling of the CMK-5 pores. Consequently, it must be concluded that the carbon produced from methane decomposition may leave the CMK-5 pores, growing towards the outside part of the catalyst particles, which should be interpreted as a direct a consequence of the singular mesoporosity present in this material with two uniform mesopore systems. As earlier indicated, in both temperature programmed and temperature constant experiments, the activity curves obtained for CMK-5 show a sharp transition in the carbon deposition rate. This interesting fact is also present when using the CMK-3 catalyst. The ratio between the pore volumes of CMK-5 and CMK-3 samples, corresponding to the 3nm pores, has been calculated as 1.39. On the other hand, the ratio between the W/W0 values at which the transition of activity occurs for CMK-5 and CMK-3 is 1.44, when operating under temperature programmed conditions. For the isothermal reactions the W/W0 ratio presents a value of 1.32, which also agrees very well with the ratio between the pore volumes of both CMK samples. All these facts suggest that the activity transition observed in the CMK catalysts at short reaction times is related to the partial filling of the catalyst pore volume caused by the carbon deposits. At short reaction times, the size and amount of the carbon deposits formed are small compared to the diameter and volume of the catalyst pores, hence the process takes place controlled by the rate of the chemical steps. However, for larger values of the size and amount of the carbon deposits, diffusional restrictions appear slowing down the accessibility of methane molecules to the active sites. Nevertheless, within the diffusional control regime the catalysts keeps a significant activity for long reaction times, showing that the carbon deposits are able to leave the CMKs mesopores, reaching and growing towards the outside part of the catalyst particles, which in turn allows these materials to retain a high catalytic activity for extended period of times and under the deposition of high amount of carbon coming from the methane decomposition reaction."
3,Conclusions,"Ordered mesoporous carbons, designated as CMK-3 and CMK-5, have been compared with commercial carbon materials (AC-mic, AC-mes and CB-bp) as catalysts for the hydrogen production by methane decomposition. This process presents the advantage of being free of CO2 emissions but has the challenge of the great amounts of carbon deposits which are formed on the catalyst, causing its deactivation. Therefore, the catalyst resistance to deactivation is an essential aspect to be considered in this process. Ordered mesoporous carbons have shown to be excellent catalysts for the hydrogen production by methane decomposition. Among the commercial carbon samples, the best results are obtained with the CB-bp sample, whereas the AC-mic and AC-mes materials become deactivated more quickly, in spite of the presence in the latter of a significant mesoporosity. Nevertheless, the activity exhibited by the ordered mesoporous carbons, especially in the case of CMK-5, is quite superior to that of the CB-bp sample. Moreover, CMK-5 may stand the formation of very high amounts of carbon deposits while still retaining a significant catalytic activity. Accordingly, it is proposed that with this catalyst the carbon formed from methane decomposition may leave the CMK-5 pores, growing towards the outside part of the catalyst particles, which avoids the total blockage of the mesopores and explain that this catalyst exhibits significant activity even after a deposition of 25 grams of carbon per gram of CMK-5."
