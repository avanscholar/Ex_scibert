0,Introduction,"Different technologies are currently available and used in the industrial production of biodiesel fuel. Processes of transesterification are usually based on homogenous alkaline catalysis, with NaOH, KOH and their alkoxides [1]. Main problem of using homogenous catalysts is necessity of relatively expensive and complex treatments of product finalization (neutralization, flushing and separation) [1–4]. These processes of purification are not environmentally favorable because of excessive water consumption, and utilization of strong alkalis and acids which has huge negative influence on environment [1,5,6]. An alternative method would be of suitable heterogeneous catalysts which solves a number of economic and environmental problems (non-corrosive catalyst easy to store easily and quickly removed from the liquid product – filtering) [7,8]. Transesterification in supercritical conditions were investigated as an alternative to conventional biodiesel production processes [9–14]. In supercritical conditions, dielectric constants of alcohols are significantly less than in normal conditions. Therefore, it approaches the dielectric constants of non-polar substances such as fats and oils, and creating a predisposition to create a single-phase system of oil and alcohol. In addition, ionic product of alcohol increases with increasing the pressure, which is why it is assumed that alcohol in supercritical conditions is not only a reactant but also an acidic catalyst [15–17]. These characteristics permit that the reaction in supercritical conditions could take place without stirring and that the water content and unsaturated fatty acids are not a limiting factors in the process of biodiesel fuel production. Several researchers have carried out investigations on the supercritical transesterification process concerning reactivity and kinetics [10,18–22]. However, there is insufficient literature which compared the effect of types of alcohol on the transesterification. Madras et al. [10] carried out transesterification of sunflower oil in supercritical methanol and supercritical ethanol at various temperatures (200–400°C) at fixed pressure (200bar) and with a constant molar ratio of alcohol to oil at 40:1. They observed that the conversions increased with the increase in temperature with both alcohols; however in supercritical ethanol the conversions were higher. These observations were confirmed by Biktasev et al. [23]. Tan et al. [24] concluded based on their optimization study that supercritical methanol reaction can achieve optimum yield (81.5%) at relatively lower reaction time compared to supercritical ethanol process (79.2%). Although these studies provided some useful information concerning the effect of methanol and ethanol on biodiesel yield they did not consider the environmental feasibility of the process which is also of great importance to access process viability. The environmental feasibility of biodiesel production in supercritical methanol conditions has been evaluated by several authors [21,25,26] while there is limited research on supercritical ethanol reaction [27]. Marulanda [21] and Morais et al. [26] concluded that the supercritical methanol process has a lower environmental load than the conventional base catalyzed process. On the other hand the environmental viability of the supercritical methanol process is questioned by Kiwjaroun et al. [25] due to high energy demand of the process and significant fossil energy consumption in the process chain of methanol. A widely accepted opinion is that by using ethanol instead of petroleum-based methanol, the transesterification process may become more sustainable and renewable because ethanol can be produced exclusively from renewable sources [28]. In the present work we studied the process of biodiesel production by the transesterification of rapeseed oil in methanol and supercritical ethanol using the experimental setups with batch regime. The effect of four variables, alcohol, temperature, pressure, time of the reaction on the biodiesel yield was investigated. The material and energy flows from each process were estimated and were used as inputs for the comparative environmental assessment."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials characterization,"2.1 Raw materials characterization Rapeseed oil produced from an oilseed rape of a Serbian origin named Kata was used in the experiment. Kata is a winter oilseed rape from the “00” maturity group (low erucic acid and glucosinolates) which makes the oilcake suitable as animal feed. Physical and chemical properties of the oils obtained are given in Table 1 . Methanol of a 99% purity used in the transesterification process was obtained from the methanol and acetic acid complex from Kikinda, Serbia (according to SRPS H.B2.031). The density is 0.791g/cm3. Ethyl alcohol used in the experiment is a fermented ethanol of a 96% purity which was delivered by Reahem d.o.o. from Novi Sad, Serbia (according to SRPS E.M3.020)."
3,Equipment and experimental procedure,"2.2 Equipment and experimental procedure Transesterification was carried out in a batch reactor (Anton Parr 4520) of 2dm3 volume. The reactor was equipped with a stirrer, with variable speed, between 0 and 670 revolutions in minute, and with an electric heater, with the possibility of heating, up to 350°C. The speed of the stirrer and the temperature of the heater were controlled with a microprocessor control unit (Anton Parr 4842), (Fig. 1 ). Oil and alcohol (methanol or ethanol) mixture was added in the reactor in molar ratio 1:42 [11,19]. The closed vessel was purged in nitrogen stream, to displacing the residual air content. After heating the reacting mixture up to desired temperature (within ±2°C), the desired pressure in the vessel was achieved by introduction of nitrogen (99.9% purity, Messer). The experiment was conducted at different temperatures (250, 300 and 350°C), pressure (8, 10, and 12MPa) and reaction time (7, 15, and 30min). After the anticipated time for transesterification, the reaction mixture in the reactor was cooled down on about 150°C. Alcohol vapour together with nitrogen were missed through on a water-cooled condenser column (length 3.5m coils), where the alcohol vapour condenses. After cooling the reaction mixture the same was poured into the separation vessel at temperature of 55°C. Although the separation begins after the first few seconds, the mixture was left in separator over 16h. After the separation of biodiesel, it was vacuum distilled, to extract the residual alcohol. The experimental results are obtained by variation of transesterification conditions. In all experiments the esters yield (E Yield ) was calculated by the following equation: (1) E Y i e l d = Amount of ester layer ( g ) ⋅ purity of ester layer ( % ) Amount of edible oil , feedstock ( g ) ( % ) After decanting, all product samples were weighed and the amount of ester was identified. By involving the values of the ester amount and the amount of edible oil in Eq. (1), yield is obtained as a function of purity of ester layer. The resulting biodiesel is subjected to gas chromatograph (GC) analysis to determine the content of fatty acid esters (according to SRPS EN 14103). GC analysis was performed on the Gas Chromatograph GC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu, equipped with autosampler AOC-20i, Capillary Column InterCap WAX (length 30m, inner diameter 0.25mm, film thickness 0.25μm. Analysis of the standard mixture of methyl esters RM-1 was carried out using reference probe sample of 0.6μL at split ratio 40:1. The injector and detector temperatures were 260°C, and the analysis was performed in isothermal conditions at 200°C. Helium was applied as carrier gas with flow rate of 3mL/min. Methyl heptadecanoate (purity >99%) (Fluka Analytical) was used as an internal standard. Sample of 1μl was injected into an injector. The used amount of electricity needed to heat the reaction mixture of oil and alcohol and to maintain the desired temperature in reactor was measured by an electricity counter (Tracon Electric TVO-F1-1). The amount of energy, nitrogen used to provide the necessary supercritical pressure (8, 10, and 12MPa) was determined empirically."
4,Statistical analysis,"2.3 Statistical analysis In order to describe the effect of temperature, pressure, time and type of alcohol on biodiesel yield linear multiple regression model was applied. Multiple regression models were estimated for each type of alcohol for the purpose of evaluating the importance of independent variables in determining the dependant variable. As the explanatory quantitative variables are not all measured in the same units their relative importance in explaining the dependent variable is established by means of standardized coefficients. For the linear regression model with p predictor variables standardized coefficients can be expressed as: (2) b ′ i = s Y s X i ⋅ b i , ( i = 1 , … , p ) , where b i , (i =1, ..., p) are the least squares estimates of regression coefficients, s Y and s X i are sample estimates of standard deviations of variables Y and X i , (i =1, …, p). Standardized regression coefficient represents the number of standard deviation units change in Y associated with one standard deviation change in X i , when other predictor variables are held constant. Multiple coefficient of determination (R 2) may be expressed using squares of standardized regression coefficients ( b ′ i 2 ) and simple coefficients of correlations between predictor variables (r ij ) as: (3) R 2 = ∑ i = 1 p b ′ i 2 + 2 ∑ i = 1 p ∑ j > i p b ′ i b ′ j r i j . Therefore, the contribution of each individual variable in explaining dependent variable is the ratio: b ′ i 2 R 2 ⋅ 100 ( % ) . It is important to note that standardized regression coefficients should be used to compare the effects of variables within equations. They can never be compared across samples or populations because the standardization is different for each group. Beside separate models for each type of alcohol, the linear multiple regression that includes both type of alcohol was estimated. Type of alcohol was included in the model as dummy variable with values 1 for methanol and 0 for ethanol alcohol. The interactions of alcohol with pressure, temperature and duration of reaction were tested by means of F-test and the difference in average levels of dependent variable applying t-test. As categorical variables do not have standard deviation, standardized coefficients for categorical variables are meaningless. In the case that the regression modal contains both numerical and categorical variables the other approach for comparing the importance of predictors should be applied. One of the approaches is based on the ratio of variances of the contributions of two sets of variables [29]. The ratio ω can be determined by: (4) ω = η ′ ⁡ W ′ ⁡ W ⁡ η γ ′ ⁡ H ′ ⁡ H ⁡ γ where η is the coefficient vector and W is the model matrix for the first set of predictors, γ is the coefficient vector and H is the model matrix for the second set of predictors. If ω =1, then both sets of predictors contribute the same amount of variation in the dependent variable. The least squares estimates of regression coefficients, estimates of coefficients standard errors, t-statistics for testing significance of the coefficients, standardized regression coefficients, R 2 and F-test were calculated using STATISTICA release 12 software [30]. The relaimpo package for program R 3.0.1 [31] was used for calculating the relative importance of independent variables, corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals and the ω ratio."
5,Life cycle assessment (LCA),"2.4 Life cycle assessment (LCA) Life cycle assessment (LCA) method is used to compare the environmental impacts of biodiesel production using two types of alcohol under different process conditions. LCA is a technique to assess the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life cycle. LCA is performed by (i) compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases throughout the life cycle of the investigated product (life cycle inventory analysis – LCI) and by (ii) evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with identified inputs and releases (life cycle impact assessment – LCIA). The analysis was conducted according to the ISO 14040:2006 following the principles of the attributional LCA. The functional unit (FU) is 1kg of biodiesel produced using supercritical methanol or supercritical ethanol under various process conditions, which means that all LCA results are related to 1kg of biodiesel. The LCA results reflect the differences in environmental terms between the alternative transesterification processes. Other processes common to the commercial biodiesel production technologies are outside the system boundary. The LCA is based on the results of LCI analysis which include information on all of the elementary flows to (i.e. emissions to air, soil and water) and from the environment (i.e. natural resources) from all the unit processes associated with the life cycle of a product or service. The total quantity of elementary flow i (E i ) in the life cycle of biodiesel was calculated using Eq. (5): (5) E i = ∑ j = 1 n I j ⋅ E i , j where I j – the quantity of input j in the transesterification process (e.g. g oil/FU); E i,j – the quantity of elementary flow i in the life cycle of input j (e.g. g CO2/g oil); n – number of inputs in the transesterification process. The quantity of material and energy inputs (I j ) in the transesterification process was calculated for each of the 54 biodiesel production alternatives. The estimation of the quantity of rapeseed oil and energy consumed in the transesterification process is based on measured data (see Section 2.2 and Table A.1). The quantity of alcohol consumed in the transesterification process is assumed to be equal to the stoichiometric amount of alcohol which is calculated from the stoichiometric alcohol-to-oil ratio of 3:1 for the transesterification process. Apart from the data regarding the quantity of inputs in the transesterification process (I j ) the quantification of elementary flows related to the biodiesel production requires data on type and quantities of emissions emitted and natural resources consumed in the life cycle of each of these input (E i,j ). These data are available from the Ecoinvent v. 2.2 database which is considered to be the most comprehensive LCI database in Europe. This database is integrated in the SimaPro 7 LCA software, which was used for the calculations [32]. A tabular overview of material and energy inputs and outputs in the transesterification process, as well as reference to data source used for the calculation of the life cycle inventory of these inputs is given in Table 2 . Transesterification is a multifunctional process resulting with two co-products: biodiesel and glycerine. According to ISO 14040:2006 the environmental flows associated with a multifunctional process should be allocated between the co-products. In this study economic allocation was used. This is consistent with the approach applied in the Ecoinvent LCI database. According to this method 99% of the burdens associated with the transesterification process are allocated to biodiesel [33]. The potential environmental impacts of natural resources consumed and emissions released into environment in the life cycle of biodiesel are evaluated using the LCIA method. In this study, the LCIA is limited to the assessment of impacts on global warming (in terms of kgCO2 eq/FU) and cumulative fossil energy requirements (in terms of MJfossil/FU). These impact categories are chosen since reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel depletion are the main driving force for the development of biodiesel industry. For the assessment of global warming impact we used the ReCiPe 2008 v. 1.08 LCIA method [34], which is based on the commonly accepted CO2 equivalency factors recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The cumulative fossil energy requirement is evaluated using the cumulative energy demand (CED) method [35]. The CED of a product represents the direct and indirect energy use in units of MJ throughout the life cycle, including the energy consumed during extraction, manufacturing and disposal of the raw and auxiliary material [36]. Both LCIA methods are integrated into the SimaPro 7 software, which was used for the calculations."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Result of transesterification,"3.1 Result of transesterification This section presents the results of two series of experiments conducted by varying different parameters for each of the alcohols, in order to determine the effect of temperature, pressure and type of alcohol on the activity in the function of time. 3.1.1 Yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) On the temperature of 350°C and pressure of 12MPa yield increases with time, from 7 to 15min (from 92.2% to 93.0%), however on 30min it decreases to 89.9%. This means that equilibrium and maximum yield is achieved between 15 and 30min. The decrease of yield on 30min can be explained by reversibility of the transesterification reaction which has been favored by temperature and by the increase of the concentration of esters and glycerine along with the duration of reaction run. On 10MPa and 350°C, the effect of reversibility is similar, but with decreasing of the pressure the yield is smaller while the maximum yield (87.5%) is achieved at 15min. Further reduction of pressure at this temperature decreases yield and the maximum yield is achieved at 30min (82.2%). By reducing the reaction temperature (300°C and 250°C) the yield decreases and it takes longer reaction time to achieve yields observed at higher temperature. The lowest yields are at a minimum temperature, minimum pressure and short reaction time (250°C, 8MPa, 7min; the yield is 13.8%). 3.1.2 Yield of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) In the series of experiments with ethyl alcohol highest yield was obtained at the highest temperature, time and pressure. By increasing the reaction time at 350°C and 12MPa, yield increases during the whole range (from 63.36% to 93.22%). This means that the equilibrium in the observed range of pressure, temperature and reaction time has not been reached. On 350°C, 10MPa and 15min equilibrium and maximum yield (91.0%) was observed. After reduction of pressure at this temperature the maximum yield is reached at 30min (80.1%). In general, lowering the pressure would be followed by yield decrease. By reducing the reaction temperature (350–250°C) the yield decreases which can in general be compensated with prolonging the duration of reaction. The lowest yields are at a minimum temperature, minimum pressure and short reaction time (250°C, 8MPa, 7min; the yield is 14.8%)."
8,Results of regression analysis,"3.2 Results of regression analysis The least squares estimates of regression coefficients, estimates of coefficients standard errors (SE), t-statistics, corresponding p values and standardized regression coefficients are shown in Table 3 . The overall goodness of fit of the regression models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination and F-test. Since the p values of all coefficients are less than 0.05 and less than 0.01 for b 1 and b 3 in the case of methanol alcohol, it may be concluded that temperature and reaction time have highly significant and pressure significant effect on yield of FAME. This corresponds to our previous findings (see Figs. 2 and 3 ). All considered predictors in the case of ethanol have highly significant effect on FAEE (p <0.01). The high values of R 2 and statistically highly significant F values for both models, indicate that applied multiple regression models adequately describe experimental data. As the independent variables in the model are mutually uncorrelated, multiple determination coefficient of the regression model is the sum of squares of standardized regression coefficients: R 2 = ∑ i = 1 3 b ′ i 2 . The relative contributions of individual variables in explaining dependent variables are shown on Fig. 4 , where 95% bootstrap confidence intervals are also presented. It can be noted that the rank of predictor importance is equal in both cases. Examination of the magnitude of the estimates indicated that in the case of methanol temperature was approximately 8 times as important as time, and time was approximately 4.3 times as important as pressure. In the case of ethanol alcohol temperature was approximately 2.4 times as important as time, and time was approximately 4.4 times as important as pressure (Fig. 4). It is assumed that the alcohol molecule directly attacks the carbonyl carbon of fatty acids bounded in glyceride species. In obtained intermediate molecule the hydrogen bond energy is lowering. The hydrogen bonding in a supercritical alcohol plays a vital role concerning its reactivity. Supercritical methanol is more acidic than supercritical ethanol, therefore shows higher reactivity as alkylation agent [37]. The phenomenon can be explained with the higher dipole moment of methyl alcohol (2.87D on 20°C) compared to the ethyl alcohol (1.66D on 20°C). Less reactivity of ethyl alcohol results in longer reaction time. Small effect of pressure can be explained by the fact that the increase in pressure affects only the orientation of the molecules. Higher proportional impact of pressure in the case of ethyl alcohol (Fig. 4) could be explained with easier orientation of higher alcohol molecules. The regression coefficients and the corresponding significance tests of the model that in addition to temperature, pressure and time contains a type of alcohol are shown in Table 4 . The estimated regression model was highly significant (F(4,49)=101.16, p <0.0000) and may be expressed as: (6) Y ˆ = − 164.5818 + 0.5408 X 1 + 3.1326 X 2 + 1.1201 X 3 + 6.4086 X 4 , where X 4, called dummy-variable is coded 1 for methanol and 0 for ethanol. The model had two different regression equations, one for methanol (Eq. (7)) other for ethanol (Eq. (8)): (7) Y ˆ = − 158.1732 + 0.5408 X 1 + 3.1326 X 2 + 1.1201 X 3 , for methanol , and (8) Y ˆ = − 164.5818 + 0.5408 X 1 + 3.1326 X 2 + 1.1201 X 3 , for ethanol. The influence of temperature, pressure and reaction time on the yield is highly statistically significant (p <0.01), while the contribution of the variable types of alcohol is statistically significant (p <0.05). As the interactions of temperature, pressure and time with the type of alcohol are not statistically significant (Table 5 ), the influence of these variables on the yield effect does not depend on the type of alcohol. Therefore estimate of parameters β i (i =1, 2, 3) are independent of the variable X 4. Since the coefficient of dummy variable shows the difference in average levels of dependent variable, the results in Table 5 have shown that the difference in average FAME and FAEE yields has been significantly different (p =0.01387). For the observed range of temperature, pressure and reaction time, the mean yield of FAME is significantly higher than the mean yield of FAEE (Fig. 5 ). This observation can be best explained by the reactivity of triglycerides with alcohol, which decreases with increasing of alkyl chain of reacting alcohol [9]. Ratio of effect standard deviations of two group of variables numerical and categorical is 7.818 and corresponding 95% confidence interval is (3.605, 16.957). The null hypothesis that ω =1 is rejected and it can be concluded that both sets of predictors do not contribute the same amount of variation in the dependent variable. Ratio of effect standard deviations of X 1 and X 4 is 6.89 with approximate 95% confidence interval (3.171, 14.97). If the contributions of X 3 and X 4 are compared the value of ratio is 3.332 and 95% confidence interval is (1.495, 7.43). As the ω ratio is higher than 1 and the confidence interval does not include 1 it can be concluded that the effects of temperature and reaction time on yields is significantly higher compared to the effect of the type of alcohol. For the comparison X 2 and X 4, the ω ratio is 1.596 and corresponding confidence interval (0.645, 3.951). This means that there is no significant difference between the contribution of pressure and alcohol to biodiesel yields."
9,Results of LCA,"3.3 Results of LCA At higher reaction temperatures and shorter reaction times transesterification in supercritical methanol instead of supercritical ethanol is justified since the process with methanol has lower global warming impact (Fig. 6 ) and lower cumulative fossil energy demand (Fig. 7 ). This is primarily because of the higher consumption of rapeseed oil per unit of biodiesel produced in the process where ethanol was used instead of methanol, i.e. due to the relatively higher yield of FAME in the observed range of reaction conditions (Fig. 5). Furthermore, compared to the process with methanol the transesterification with ethanol has in general higher consumption of alcohol and energy per unit of biodiesel produced (calculated from Table A.1) as a consequence of the longer reaction time required for the same yield. With increasing the time of reaction the comparative advantage of supercritical methanol is decreasing (Figs. 7 and 8 ). Points 1, 10 and 22, on Figs. 6 and 7, show the extreme differences of transesterification by ethanol and methanol. Extreme differences in points 1 and 10 (350°C, 7min, 8MPa and 300°C, 7min, 8MPa) can be explained with the fact that the reaction with methanol is faster and this is more evident in biodiesel yield at shorter time of reaction. With prolonging the reaction time by keeping the temperature and pressure constant differences in yields of FAME and FAEE decrease. Extreme difference at point 22 (250°C, 15min, 8MPa) can be explained as a consequence of the lower boundary conditions of ethanol-related to pressure, so it can be assumed that the conversion of ethanol becomes higher, because the reaction with ethanol takes place in kinetic regime, and with methanol in diffusion-kinetic regime. By increasing of pressure this difference decreases and the influence of temperature and reaction time becomes the most important variable. Biodiesel yield has a crucial effect on LCA results. Lower impact category indicator results were observed at higher yields of biodiesel. This is because the LCA results – both in terms of global warming impacts and cumulative energy requirement of the transesterification process – are mainly determined with the oil consumption per unit of biodiesel produced. Rapeseed oil related environmental flows are responsible for 74–83% of the global warming impact and 60–68% of cumulative energy demand of the transesterification in supercritical methanol. In the case of FAEE the contribution of oil to global warming impacts and fossil depletion is 70–77% and 62–70%, respectively. Based on data from the Ecoinvent 2.2 database methanol has a lower global warming impact, however higher cumulative fossil energy requirements than the same mass of ethanol produced from corn (0.75 compared to 1.92kgCO2eq/kg; 36.91 compared to 19.34MJfossil/kg). A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to investigate whether the global warming impact of FAEE could be reduced by using ethanol produced from other sources than corn. The results have revealed that the global warming impacts of FAEE can be reduced if ethanol from grass, sugarcane or sugar beets is used instead of corn based ethanol. However, at reaction temperatures between 300°C and 350°C and shorter reaction time even the environmentally most favorable ethanol process would have a higher global warming impact than the transesterification in supercritical methanol (Fig. 8)."
10,Conclusions,"Comparing the influence of pressure, temperature and reaction time on yields it can be concluded that the influence of temperature is higher than pressure and time of reaction. However, these variables have different importance in the case of FAME and FAEE. The relative importance of time in explaining yields is significantly higher in case of FAEE. In the observed range of temperature, pressure and reaction time, transesterification in supercritical methanol yields in average more than transesterification in supercritical ethanol. Equilibrium in supercritical methanol is achieved in shorter time. With prolonging the time of reaction beyond equilibrium the yield of FAME decreases due to reversibility while the yield of FAEE continues to increase. These observations are valid for reaction conditions investigated (7–30min, 8–10MPa, 250–350°C). The results of LCA have revealed that at higher temperatures and shorter reaction time the usage of ethanol instead of methanol will not reduce the global warming impact and improve the renewability of the transesterification process. This is primarily because of the comparatively higher yields and lower energy and alcohol requirements per unit of biodiesel produced at higher temperatures in the supercritical methanol process."
