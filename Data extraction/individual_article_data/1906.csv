0,Introduction,"Presently, fuels and chemicals are generally derived from fossil resources. The increases of world population and economy lead to high demands of energy and petrochemicals as well as environmental issue, those lead the researchers are interested in bio-based energy and chemical developments to replace fossil consumption [1,2]. The integrated biorefinery processes employ various biomass feedstocks and conversion technologies to produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals [3]. Excluding biofuel, the bio-based chemicals can be divided in many kinds such as bioplastics, polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), plant oils, fatty acids (FA), bio-lubricants, bio-solvents, biosurfactants, inks and dyes, and other bio-synthetic products [4]. Oleochemicals are chemicals derived from vegetable oils and animal fats. The basic oleochemicals include fatty acids, methyl esters, fatty alcohols of these fatty acids and glycerol as well as fatty amines [5], those can be used as raw materials or as intermediaries for pharmaceutical and food industries, soap and laundry detergent, and personal care products, etc. Palmitic acid (PA) is a saturated long-chain fatty acid, which is naturally found in plant oils and animal fats, palm oil and palm kernel oil, as well as in butter, cheese, milk and meat. As available fatty acid material, PA is an interesting material that is transformed into high value oleochemicals. Isopropyl palmitate is the one of high value oleochemicals to employ as solvent for mineral oil, silicone and lanolin, further, it is widely consumed in tropical medicinal preparations due to its good absorption characteristics. Isopropyl palmitate is typically prepared by esterification of palmitic acid with isopropyl alcohol in presence of catalyst. In addition, many researchers have reported that the homogeneous catalyst has higher performance than heterogeneous catalyst for esterification of fatty acid with isopropyl alcohol [6,7]. Chin et al. [8] reported that the use of heterogeneous hybrid silica gel-‘succinic acid-zinc acetate’ catalyst at 140 °C for 4 h using stirred batch reactor provided 70% conversion of palmitic acid to isopropyl palmitate. Chandane et al. [9] investigated p-toluene sulfonic acid as a homogeneous catalyst for esterification in molar ratio of 7:1 (isopropyl alcohol to palmitic acid), the conversion of palmitic acid of 92% to isopropyl palmitate was shown at 6 h. However, to prepare isopropyl palmitate by esterification process using homogeneous catalyst, the limitations of this process were high alcohol consumption, catalyst separation and neutralization. Fatty alcohols are also the appealing oleochemicals, which can be applied for cosmetic and personal care industries as emulsion stabilizers due to their amphiphilic properties. Normally, fatty alcohols are produced through hydrogenation of methyl ester of fatty acid, and can be produced directly through hydrogenation of fatty acid [10]. However, the hydrogenations of methyl palmitate or palmitic acid mostly produced 1-hexadecanol, and the reaction conditions were occurred under high pressure with long reaction time. Catalytic hydrogenation of methyl palmitate over Pd–Cu/ diatomite catalyst under initial H2 pressure of 5.5 MPa at 300 °C for 7 h in autoclave reactor was produced 1-hexadecanol in yield of 21.9% [11]. Zhang et al. [12] reported that 1-hexadecanol in 57.86 % yield was produced from hydrogenation of palmitic acid with Cu/Al2O3 at 330 °C. From above reviews, there are the intricacy of bio-based chemical synthesis about the many steps of processes and/or the limit of reaction conditions. So, the one-pot synthesis over heterogeneous catalyst for simultaneously obtaining bio-based chemical is the most intriguing object. In addition, in literature surveys, the production of n-pentadecanol at mild conditions had slightly reported. The major reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), decarbonylation (DCN), decarboxylation (DCX) and hydrocracking [13–17] are provided into catalytic hydrotreating to reduce the content of heteroatoms (O, N, and S) from raw materials, that involves biofuel and bio-based chemical productions from bio-based materials. Due to the high prices of commercial nickel-based catalysts and the expensive materials of catalyst supports such as Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2 or MgO [18,19], brown coal with high ion-exchange capacity and high porosity can be a cheap catalyst support [20]. Brown coal is inexpensive with the price below $100/ton, being more than 50 times cheaper than the activated alumina [21,22], so that the use of coals as the support material is advantage in many respects including a coal-supported nickel catalyst. Nickel-loaded Loy Yang brown coal char catalyst (Ni/LY char) had been particularly investigated on gasification of biomasses to produce syngas [23,24]. Meesuk et al. [25] studied bio-oil production by hydropyrolysis of rice husk using Ni/LY char catalyst. Limonite ore is a cheap Fe-based catalyst, it is mostly performed for the catalytic cracking and reforming of tars or volatiles from biomass and coal [26–30]. Hita et al. [31] used limonite ore as a catalyst to study structure–reactivity relationships from hydrotreatment of lignins. There are no reports of Ni/LY char and limonite ore catalysts that play on production of bio-based chemical by catalytic hydrotreating of fatty acid. In this study, the low-cost catalysts of Ni/LY char and limonite were prepared to aim the feasibility of production of bio-based chemical from fatty acid by catalytic hydrotreating, when the palmitic acid was used as a representative reactant. The parameters of catalyst type, solvent type; non-polar (hexane) and polar aprotic (acetone); and reaction time were considered. The chemical compounds of products were analyzed and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were presented in chemical composition group, carbon number distribution and product selectivity. The liquid product properties including elemental composition, higher heating value, H/C and O/C atomic ratios, and degree of deoxygenation (DOD) were characterized. The properties of fresh and spent catalysts were also characterized."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Palmitic acid (≥98%, GC grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was used as a reactant. Analytical reagent grade hexane (99%) and acetone (99.8%) solvents, and nickel (II) carbonate basic were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Ammonium carbonate (≥30.0% NH3 basis) and 28% ammonia solution were purchased from Chameleon Reagent, Ltd. Loy Yang (LY) brown coal from Australia was used as a support for nickel-loaded brown coal char catalyst (Ni/LY char). The Indonesian natural limonite ore obtained from Kobe Steel, Ltd, was applied as limonite catalyst."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The Ni/LY coal was prepared by ion-exchange method [23–25] using LY coal and nickel solution. For nickel solution preparation, 35 g of ammonium carbonate, 95 g of nickel (II) carbonate basic, 200 g of 28% ammonia solution and 170 g of deionized (DI) water were mixed and stirred for 1 h. Then, the blue solution was separated by filtration and collected as a nickel solution ((NH3)6·NiCO3). The LY coal (11.5 g) with particle size in range of 0.5–1 mm was mixed with 13.55 ml nickel solution and 10 ml DI water for ion-exchanging by stirring for 3 h. The ion-exchanged LY coal was filtered and washed with DI water until the water was neutral pH, then it was dried in the oven at 107 °C for 24 h under N2 environment. In this study, nickel loading amount was 6.6 wt% in Ni/LY coal. The Ni/LY coal was devolatilized for generating Ni/LY char under N2 atmosphere, the temperature was increased from room temperature to 650 °C with heating rate of 15 °C/min and held at 650 °C for 1 h. After devolatilization, Ni/LY char was produced with nickel loading of 12.78 wt%. It is noted that the weight percentages of nickel were calculated by ash analysis. Limonite catalyst was prepared following the method of Li et al. [26], the fine particle of limonite ore was mixed with DI water in mass ratio of 1:1 and dried at 107 °C for 24 h. After that limonite was crushed and collected the particle size in range of 0.5–1.0 mm by sieving. Limonite catalyst was used directly in the reaction without activation step."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Fresh and spent catalysts were characterized the physicochemical properties and crystalline structure. The BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore size diameter of catalysts were evaluated using nitrogen physisorption measurements (BELSORP-max, MicrotracBEL Corp.). The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a SmartLab (Rigaku Corp.) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The diffraction patterns were recorded at scanning range from 10° to 80°. X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Shimadzu EDX-7000) was applied to analyze the element composition of catalysts. For Ni/LY char catalyst, fresh and spent catalysts were examined the morphology using FE-scanning electron microscope (JEOL JEM-6335F). The nickel size distribution was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010)."
5,Production of bio-based chemicals by catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid,"2.4 Production of bio-based chemicals by catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid 2.4.1 Operating conditions of catalytic hydrotreating Catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid was carried out in 120 ml stirring batch-autoclave reactor as shown in Fig. 1 . Palmitic acid of 1 g was mixed with 10 g of solvent and 1 g of catalyst, then the mixture was placed in the reactor. The reactor was closed and compressed with 1 MPa H2 for 3 times to displace the air, then the initial H2 of 3 MPa was compressed and held in the reactor. Next, the reactor was heated to the temperature of 300 °C and held for 1–5 h with impeller rotation speed of 200 rpm. After reaction, the mixtures were rested to cool down into room temperature. The gaseous phase (not analyzed) was released. The catalyst was separated from liquid phase by filtration. The liquid product after solvent removal was collected and analyzed. 2.4.1.1 Product analysis After catalytic hydrotreating, the liquid mixture (product and solvent) was collected, the solvent was removed from liquid product by evaporation under bench hood atmosphere at room temperature. The composition of liquid product was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP2010) equipped with Rtx-5MS column (length 60 m × inner diameter 0.25 mm × film thickness 0.25 µm) and flame ionization detector (FID). The sample of 0.05 g was diluted with 2.5 ml GC grade acetone before analysis. The oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 2 min and raised to 300 °C with heating rate of 3 °C/min and held at 300 °C for 40 min. The mass spectrometer detector was programmed with solvent delay technique to eliminate the solvent signal, the peak of acetone was disappeared from the chromatograms of product compositions. The standard mass spectrum library from National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) was used to identify the substances of product from GC–MS. The relative fraction of product substances can be calculated from the peak area percentage of the GC–MS chromatogram that also can be implied as yield percentage [32], which was determined as Eq. (1). The percentage of palmitic acid conversion [33] was defined as equation Eq. (2). The product selectivity [32] was calculated by Eq. (3), the term of area of all products was a summation of peak area of all detected substances without palmitic acid. (1) Yield % = Area of desired product Area of all detected substances x 100 (2) Conversion % = Mass of initial palmitic acid - Mass of unconverted palmitic acid Mass of initial palmitic acid x 100 (3) Product selectivity % = Area of desired product Area of all products x 100 The elemental compositions of palmitic acid and products from catalytic hydrotreating were analyzed by Leco CHN-2000 elemental analyzer, the oxygen content was calculated by differential. The higher heating value (HHV) of product was calculated by means of Sheng and Azevedo [34] as Eq. (4). (4) HHV MJ / Kg = - 1.3675 + 0.3137 C + 0.7009 H + 0.0318 O Where the C, H, O and N are the weight percent of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen in products, respectively. The degree of deoxygenation (DOD) was calculated using Eq. (5), (5) Degree of deoxygenation % = MO palmitic - MO Product MO palmitic x 100 where MOpalmitic and MOproduct are the molar oxygen/carbon ratios of palmitic acid and product from catalytic hydrotreating, respectively [35]."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization In this research work, for the Ni/LY char case, the Ni/LY coal after ion-exchange preparation was devolatilized into Ni/LY char by heating with 15 °C /min and holding at 650 °C for 1 h under N2 environment as a fresh catalyst. While the limonite catalyst from a raw limonite ore was used directly without reduction step. The spent catalysts were picked up from conditions of 3 MPa initial H2 pressure at reaction time of 5 h with hexane solvent. The chemical analysis of fresh and spent catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The active elements, Ni and Fe were a little change between fresh and spent catalysts. The textural properties including BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore size diameter of fresh and spent catalysts were shown in Table 2 . Considering the fresh catalyst, Ni/LY char catalyst indicated the high BET surface area of 308 m2/g, the total pore volume was 0.188 cm3/g with average pore diameter of 2.43 nm. While the limonite catalyst had the lower BET surface area than another one with 95 m2/g, the total pore volume was 0.300 cm3/g with average pore diameter of 12.59 nm. After catalytic hydrotreating, the spent catalysts illustrated the decreases of the BET surface area and the total pore volume while the average pore sizes were increased. Both spent catalysts especially Ni/LY char were highly deactivated that caused by coking and carbon deposition on the outer surface or within pores of catalysts, that led to the losses of catalytic surface site and catalyst effectiveness [36]. Furthermore, the study of Li et al. reported that the spent Ni-based catalyst from bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation at reaction temperature of 300 °C also had the decreases of BET surface areas (from 279 to 16 m2/g) and total pore volume (0.154 to 0.022 cm3/g) [37]. The Ni/LY char catalyst was rapidly deactivated due to the Ni particles and active sites covering by amorphous and graphitic carbons [38], the discussion would be supported by XRD patterns. The XRD patterns of fresh and spent catalysts are presented as Fig. 2 . As seen in Fig. 2a, the fresh Ni/LY char had the diffraction peaks at 2 θ of 44.6°, 52.0° and 76.7° which belong to Ni (JCPDS card No. 00–004-0850) [19]. The amorphous carbon was presented with a broad peak at 2 θ around 24.3° [39], the graphite showed the characteristic diffraction peak at 2 θ of 26.57° (JCPDS card No. 00-056-0159) [40]. The partially graphitic structure was presented on the fresh Ni/LY char catalyst due to the graphitization during catalyst preparation via carbonization at 650 °C for 1 h under N2 atmosphere that accorded with the presence of graphitic structure of carbon materials from other works [41,42]. The spent Ni/LY char catalyst showed characteristic diffraction peak of Ni mostly similar to that of fresh Ni/LY char, but the intensity of graphite diffraction peak was changed. The decreasing intensity of graphite peak in spent Ni/LY char might be discussed by the structure transformation of coke that deposited on catalyst. He et al. studied the characteristic of coke deposition on Ni-based catalyst during catalytic cracking and reforming of toluene, they reported that the formation of amorphous carbon was prior to that of graphite carbon, and a part of amorphous carbon converted to graphite carbon. In their experiments around 620–650 °C, the formation rate of graphite carbon was obviously increased from 30 to 60 min, then, from 60 min to 120 min the amount of graphite carbon decreased while that of amorphous carbon increased [38]. In this study, the spent Ni/LY char catalyst was passed 650 °C for 1 h in process of catalyst preparation and was operated during catalytic hydrotreating at 300 °C for 5 h, so the spent catalyst presented the decrease of graphitic carbon in XRD pattern. The graphite phenomenon was attributed to the aging process of graphite carbon in which the formed graphite structure might be destroyed into small graphite layers and even amorphous carbon. As seen in Fig. 2b, the fresh limonite presented the diffraction peaks of goethite (Fe2O3 ∙ H2O; JCPDS card No. 00–001-0401) which was an iron oxyhydroxide that found in limonite ore, then after the catalytic hydrotreating reaction under the 3 MPa H2 atmosphere at 300 °C for 5 h, the spent limonite showed the pattern of magnetite (Fe3O4; JCPDS card No. 01–073-9877). The present of magnetite in spent limonite catalyst related with the study of Li et al., they found the main chemical component in raw limonite ore at 30 °C is goethite (presented in formula of FeOOH) which did not dehydrate below 200 °C. The higher temperature of 400 °C the goethite was transformed into magnetite due to the pure hydrogen atmosphere [26]. The transformation of goethite to magnetite during catalytic hydrotreating could be illustrated by the dehydration (calination) of goethite to hematite as Eq. (6) [30,43], and the partial reduction of hematite to magnetite for catalyst activation as can be seen in Eqs. (7)–(8) [44]. (6) Fe2O3 H2O → Fe2O3 + H2O ΔH = +7.87 kJ/mol (7) 3Fe2O3 + H2 → 2Fe3O4 + H2O ΔH = -16.3 kJ/mol (8) 3Fe2O3 + CO → 2Fe3O4 + CO2 ΔH = +24.8 kJ/mol For morphological characterization of Ni/LY char catalyst, the SEM images of fresh and spent catalysts are showed in Fig. 3 . The surface of spent catalyst was more smooth than fresh catalyst according to the decreases of BET surface area and total pore volume. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of fresh and spent Ni/LY char catalysts. The histograms of metallic Ni particle size distribution as determined by statistical analysis of about 200 particles without counting agglomerated Ni particles [45] are also presented. In Fig. 4a, the fresh catalyst presented the dispersion of Ni species on LY char, the metallic nickel in round shapes as dark grains dispersed well in LY coal char with particle size distribution in range of 3.5–8.5 nm (average size of 5.66 nm). The spent catalyst in Fig. 4b showed the less increase of average metallic Ni size (6.12 nm), the Ni particles showed a little decreasing dispersion on LY char."
8,Catalytic hydrotreating over Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic hydrotreating over Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts To compare the effects of polar and non-polar solvents on conversion and product composition, acetone and hexane were represented as polar and non-polar solvent species, respectively. Background of acetone selection was that acetone is appreciated to use as polar aprotic solvent for catalytic reaction [35,46,47]. Therefore, the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid under the initial H2 pressure of 3 MPa at reaction temperature of 300 °C for 1, 3 and 5 h with Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts, using acetone and hexane as solvents were considered. 3.2.1 Production distribution Under the experimental results, the productions of bio-based chemicals via hydrotreating of palmitic acid under different solvents were divided into 2 parts including Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts. 3.2.1.1 Palmitic acid conversion As shown in Fig. 5 , Ni/LY char catalyst with acetone solvent presented the constant palmitic acid conversion at about 67% in all of reaction times, which might be a maximum conversion due to the limit of Ni/LY char catalyst ability in this reaction conditions. The percentage of palmitic acid conversion might be rapidly increased from initial conversion to nearly constant conversion at reaction time before 1 h. Then, the conversions held constantly from 1 to 5 h. The reason could be supported by the results of other researchers. Fang et al. reported that the palmitic acid conversion over PTA@PdCu@FeIII–MOF-5 catalyst was 95% at reaction time of 1.5 h then the reaction was reached to constant conversion (99.8%) at 2 h under initial H2 pressure of 2 MPa at reaction temperature of 240 °C [48]. Ding et al. studied the hydrodeoxygenation of palmitic acid over MoO2/CNTs catalyst, the result was found that the nearly complete conversion of palmitic acid was obtained after reaction for 40 min under 4 MPa initial H2 at 220 °C [49]. Ojeda et al. investigated the palmitic acid conversion over Ni/ZMS-5 with H2 flow rate of 20 ml/min under reaction pressure of 2 MPa at 300 °C, the reaction presented the constant conversion about 98% at reaction time of 2 h [50]. In addition, Xin et al. reported that the hydrodeoxygenation of palmitic acid over activated carbon supported nickel phosphide catalyst obtained the complete conversion at 2.5 h with operating conditions at 5% H2/Ar flow rate of 30 ml/min and reaction temperature of 350 °C [51]. From above reviews, their operating conditions closed to this research study so that it might be feasible that the reaction at 1 h approached the constant conversion of palmitic acid, however, it was noted that the chemical compositions of liquid products were different. For the case of hexane solvent, Ni/LY char catalyst presented the palmitic acid conversions of 16.76%, 26.67% and 31.41% at reaction times of 1, 3 and 5 h, respectively. Limonite catalyst case, the reaction under acetone solvent showed the increase of palmitic acid conversion when the reaction time was increased with 77.63%, 79.37% and 86.47% at reaction times of 1, 3 and 5 h, respectively. For the liquid products from hexane solvent case, limonite catalyst presented the increasing conversion from 86.26% to 93.43% when the reaction time was increased from 1 to 3 h. The complete palmitic acid conversion was shown at 5 h. It can be noted that the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid with limonite catalyst under non-polar solvent presented the high conversion of palmitic acid, especially at reaction time of 5 h, it could show the complete conversion. 3.2.1.2 Chemical composition group The obtained liquid products analyzed by GC–MS were divided into 8 groups of bio-based chemicals including fatty acid, hydrocarbon, ester, alcohol, ether, ketone, aldehyde and other compounds. The composition groups of liquid products are shown in Fig. 6 . Considering the liquid products from catalytic hydrotreating over Ni/LY char with acetone solvent as shown in Fig. 6a, the compound groups of hydrocarbon and ketone were increased, esters were slightly decreased when reaction time was increased. The reaction time of 1 h showed the highest ester composition in percentage of 58.94 when compared with other reaction times, ketone and hydrocarbon were also found in 6.01% and 2.85%, respectively. While at 3 h, ester group was lightly decreased, ketone and hydrocarbon were lightly increased into 6.35% and 5.16%, respectively. And at the reaction time of 5 h, the liquid product composition was consisted of 12.49% hydrocarbon, 9.62% ketone and 42.43% ester and the unconverted palmitic acid was 32.92%. For the case of Ni/LY catalyst with hexane solvent, the small hydrocarbon compounds in liquid products were 5.09%, 7.99% and 12.75% at reaction times of 1, 3 and 5 h, respectively. The unreacted palmitic acid was decreased by the increase of reaction time because it converted to other chemical groups. Focusing the reaction time of 5 h, the liquid compositions were compounded with 12.75% hydrocarbon, 15.58% ester, 68.71% palmitic acid and small amount of alcohol. From the above results it can be concluded that, the use of polar aprotic solvent in catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid with Ni/LY char might appreciate for producing ester and ketone. In addition, with low temperature of 300 °C and initial H2 pressure of 3 MPa, the operation could be done at 1 h to obtain high percentage of ester in about 59%. As Ni/LY char is the cheap catalyst so that it is very interesting to use Ni/LY char for ester production via the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid to gain bio-based chemical from biomass. However, the use of non-polar solvent with Ni/LY char could improve the conversions of palmitic acid, but the conversions also stilled in low percentage with the maximum conversion only 31.41%. The composition groups of liquid products from limonite catalyst with acetone solvent are illustrated in Fig. 6b. The compositions presented the increases of hydrocarbon and alcohol groups when the reaction time was increased. In the reaction time of 5 h, the product fractions were 34.32% ketone, 29.51% hydrocarbon, 9.8% alcohol and 7.35% ester, and the remained palmitic acid was 14.04%. For limonite catalyst with hexane solvent, especially at 5 h, the product was mainly distributed in oxygenated compounds (alcohol, ester, ketone and aldehyde) with the dominant group in alcohol (up to 52%). Even though it could generate hydrocarbon, its percentage was not satisfying, 25.72% hydrocarbon. Moreover, when focusing on ketone products, limonite ore with polar aprotic solvent could produce ketone group in about 35% at reaction time of 3 h. So, the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid over limonite catalyst might be more suitable for producing bio-based chemicals than biofuels. As the results, the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid over low-cost Ni/LY char and limonite ore catalysts have the ability and potentiality to produce the oleochemicals especially ester and alcohol groups, which are fatty acid ester and fatty alcohol, those are the important intermediaries that can be developed to be derivatives for producing consumable goods in various industries such as detergent, surfactant, solvent and lubrication. 3.2.2 Proposed overall reaction pathways The proposed overall reaction pathways for catalytic hydrotreating of fatty acid can be explained as Fig. 7 . The proposed reaction pathways were adapted from various researches [14,52–54] together with the results obtained on different catalysts and solvents in this study. Based on the catalytic hydrotreating over Ni/LY char catalyst, ester was found as a main product group that was generated when the fatty acid was reacted with alkyl alcohol via esterification (reaction (1)) [53]. Then, ester could be cracked into aldehyde and alcohol as shown in reaction (2) [54], however, aldehyde and alcohol could be converted alternately via hydrogenation and dehydrogenation as presented in reaction (4) [55]. Then, alcohol might be converted into n-alkane via hydrogenolysis (reaction (5)) with the number of carbon atom same as original fatty acid [56]. The major routes for n-alkane generation via hydrotreating over Ni/LY char were decarboxylation and decarbonylation of fatty acid, which simultaneously occurred to produce alkane and alkene with one atom of carbon less than the carbon atom of fatty acid as can be seen in reaction 12 and 15, respectively [57]. After that, Cn-1 alkene was hydrogenated into Cn-1 alkane via reaction 13 [58]. For the proposed reaction pathways of catalytic hydrotreating of fatty acid over limonite catalyst, especially the reaction under acetone solvent, ketone was found as a main product group that might be occurred by ketonization. As presented in reaction 21, two fatty acids were reacted together via dehydration reaction to produce the anhydride, then it was converted into ketone via ketonization with CO2 removal as shown in reaction 22 [59]. Furthermore, ketone could be transformed into long chain hydrocarbon via hydrogenolysis as reaction 23. The long chain hydrocarbons also were generated from aldehyde via the reactions 9 and 10. The light fatty acid and hydrocarbon products could be generated by cracking (reaction 11) [14]. Considering the transformation of hydrocarbons, Cn-1 alkane and Cn alkane were isomerized into saturated hydrocarbon isomers as can be seen in reactions 14 and 24, respectively. Then the saturated hydrocarbon isomers were converted into unsaturated hydrocarbon isomers and further transformed to cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes and aromatics via dehydrogenation as presented in reactions 25–28 [52]. Likewise, the Cn-1 alkenes could be transformed into unsaturated hydrocarbon isomers and cycloalkanes via isomerization (reaction 16) and cyclization (reaction 17), respectively. Moreover, Cn-1 alkenes also might be formed into dimers or heavy products via dimerization as reaction 18 [14]. Additionally, heavy products were generated by dehydrogenation and dimerization of fatty acid as can be seen in reactions 19 and 20 [60]. The alcohol group that mainly found in the product from the case of limonite catalyst under hexane solvent was formed by hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation following reactions (3) and (4). 3.2.3 Carbon number distribution As the results from Figs. 5 and 6, when considered the palmitic acid conversion into the chemical composition groups of products, it was found that the catalytic hydrotreating conditions of initial 3 MPa H2 pressure at 300 °C for 5 h presented the high conversion of palmitic acid and showed the interesting chemical groups. To compare the carbon number distributions of the liquid products from these operating conditions with both catalysts and two solvents, the results were presented in term of carbon number and product content. The liquid products were divided into 10 groups of hydrocarbons (n-paraffin, isoparaffin, cycloparaffin, olefin and aromatic) and oxygenated compounds (ester, alcohol, ether, ketone and aldehyde). The major products were the oxygenated compounds, however there were the small amounts of non-polar substances as hydrocarbons. Moreover, the total chromatograms and main compounds of liquid products from GC–MS are shown as Figure S1 in supplementary material. 3.2.3.1 Acetone solvent Acetone is widely used as polar aprotic solvent, which has been reported to be effective in several hydrothermal processes including hydrothermal liquid fraction of biomass into bio-oil [61,62], and the hydrothermal upgrading of crude bio-oil [35,63]. In this study, acetone was also applied as solvent for catalytic hydrotreating. For catalyst hydrotreating of palmitic acid with Ni/LY char catalyst under acetone solvent in this study, the products were mostly distributed in 19 carbon atoms (C19) in percentage of 36.98 with 34.83% ester, 1.32% ketone and 0.83% alcohol as shown in Fig. 8 a. The ester, isopropyl palmitate (C19H38O2), was found as the main component of product that presented in peak No.6 of chromatogram (Figure S1a). As shown in Fig. 9 , the reaction pathway of catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid to isopropyl palmitate over Ni/LY char especially in acetone solvent was considered. Acetone might be used as a co-reactant; acetone was a ketone compound that could be transformed to alcohol by carbonyl reduction (1) [64]. Acetone was reduced and converted to isopropyl alcohol (secondary alcohol) in the presences of H2 and Ni catalyst as reducing agents, then isopropyl alcohol reacted with palmitic acid to generate isopropyl palmitate via esterification (2). GC–MS chromatograms of the products from Ni/LY char catalyst with acetone solvent are shown in Figure S1a of supplementary material. The peak of acetone was disappeared in chromatogram because acetone solvent was removed by evaporation from liquid product after catalytic hydrotreating reaction, and the mass spectrometer detector was programmed with solvent delay technique to avoid the solvent signal. Acetone was also used as co-reactant in other research works, Chen et al. [61] reported that the bio-oil produced with acetone had more peaks of GC–MS chromatogram than other solvent types, it indicated that the composition of bio-oil generated from acetone was complicated. Moreover, Oh et al. [35] studied the use of polar aprotic acetone in hydrodeoxgenation (HDO) of bio-oil, acetone acted as co-reactant during HDO reaction, the esters were observed in liquid product due to the possibility of hydrogen bonding between polar solvent and organic compound. The other esters were distributed in 2.46% isopropyl myristate (C17); 1.43% hexadecanoic acid, 2-methylpropyl ester (C20); 1.17% isopropyl stearate (C21); and 1.05% hexadecanoic acid, hexadecyl ester (C32). The hydrocarbons distributed in n-paraffin which were 5.26% C15 and 2.43% C17 when isoparaffin and cycloparaffin hydrocarbons were lightly presented in 1.41% C18 and 0.88% C12, those were heptadecane, 2-methyl; and cyclopentane, 1-butyl-2-propyl; respectively. The ketones were distributed in 5.68% C17, 1.32% C19 and 0.85% C18 those were 2-heptadecanone, 2-nonadecanone and 5-octadecanone, respectively. The unconverted palmitic acid (C16) was 32.85%. Considering limonite catalyst under acetone solvent in Fig. 8b, the product composition was variously distributed than Ni/LY char case. The ketone was the main composition group of the product with 34.34%, that were mostly distributed in 10.46% C17, 7.54% C9, 4.4% C6, 2.43% C18 and 1.95% C19 with the main components of 2-heptadecanone; 2-cyclohexen-1-one,3,5,5-trimethyl; 3-penten-2-one,4-methyl; 5-octadecanone; and 2-nonadecanone; respectively. The unconverted palmitic acid was presented in 13.53% C16. Alcohols were 9.8% of product those mostly distributed in 2.16% C10, 1.54% C15 and 1.31% C9 with dominant components of 3-ethyl-5-methyl-1-heptyn-3-ol; n-pentadecanol; and 2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-en-1-ol; respectively. The ester group was found in percentage of 7.35 with 2.56% distribution in C19 (isopropyl palmitate). Ether compounds were found in 3.96% with main components of furan, 2-methoxy (C5); and 3,4-dimethylphenyl tetradecyl ether (C22). For the hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbon was found as a main specie with 13.79% of the product, which distributed in 4.11% C9, 3.37% C18, 2.99% C12 and 2.66% C27 with the major components of benzene,1,3,5-trimethyl; octane,3,7-dimethyl-1-(2,5-xylyl); benzene,1,4-dimethyl-2-(2-methylpropyl); and benzene,1,3,5-trimethyl-2-octadecyl; respectively. The formation of benzene,1,3,5-trimethyl (mesitylene) might be explained by the aromatization of acetone. As shown in Fig. 10 , the reaction pathway was adapted from the study of aromatization of acetone over zirconium phosphonate catalyst [65]. For this study, under the condition of limonite catalyst, acetone molecules were near enough to each other to occur condensation-polymerization reactions then mesityl oxide (3-penten-2-one, 4-methyl-) was generated as identified in peak No. 9 of Figure S1b. Then, phorone (2,5-heptadien-4-one, 2,6-dimethyl-) was formed as presented in peak No. 12. After that isophorone (2-cyclohexen-1-one, 3,5,5-trimethyl-) was produced via cyclization then mesitylene was generated by aromatization those were confirmed as peaks No. 13 and 10, respectively. Olefin hydrocarbon was found in 6.32%, the carbon number distributions were 2.24% C19 (1-nonadecene), 1.25% C16 (pentadecane, 8-methylene) and 1.01% C23 (9-tricosene, (Z)). The cycloparaffin hydrocarbon was found in 6.15% of the product with carbon distributions of 2.29% C12 and 1.89% C10; cyclopentane, 1-butyl-2-propyl was found as a dominant component of the group. The n-paraffin hydrocarbon was lightly found with 3.78% of the product, it was mainly distributed in 1.48% C15 (n-pentadecane). 3.2.3.2 Hexane solvent Focusing Ni/LY char catalyst with hexane circumstance (Fig. 11 a), the compositions were mostly distributed in the dominant oxygenated compound, the unconverted palmitic acid with 16 carbon atoms was 68.59%. The other oxygenated compounds with 14.64%, ester compounds, especially C19 and C32 were generated from the reaction of palmitic acid to liquid products including isopropyl palmitate; and hexadecanoic acid, hexadecyl ester; respectively. Hydrocarbon compounds were found only in n-paraffin groups those were distributed in 9.38% C15, 1.27% C16 and 1.25% C14. Regarding limonite catalyst under the same solvent type as shown in Fig. 11b, the oxygenated compounds were greatly generated at 73.93% that consisted of 51.84% alcohols. The produced alcohol was 56.97 times when compared with Ni/LY char catalyst case. n-Pentadecanol (C15) was found as a major alcohol with 37.05% that was presented in peak No. 27 of chromatogram (Figure S1d). The other alcohols were distributed in 12.59% C25 and 2.07% C27 (1-pentacosanol and 1-heptacosanol, respectively). The esters were mainly distributed in C32 of 12.61% that was hexadecanoic acid, hexadecyl ester (as seen in peak No. 8 of Figure S1d). Hydrocarbons were found in 10.2% n-paraffins (5.08% >C34, 4.28% C16 and 1.58% C15) and 13.66% olefins. The olefins were distributed in 6.67% C20, 4.41% C19 and 2.39% C30 those were 1-eicosene, 1-nonadecene and 13-methyl-Z-14-nonacosene as main components, respectively. 3.2.4 Outstanding bio-based chemical products The product selectivities of the selected outstanding oxygenated compounds of ester, ketone and alcohol groups from catalytic hydrotreating were calculated from Eq. (3) and summarized as shown in Table 3 . Ni/LY char catalyst could promote the ester as the main group especially in acetone solvent, which had the 82% isopropyl palmitate of ester with product selectivity of 51.87% as an outstanding compound. For ketone, 2-heptadecanone was found in selectivity of 8.46%. Considering the products from Ni/LY char catalyst with hexane solvent, in ester group, isopropyl palmitate was also found with product selectivity of 27.76%, while the other compounds, ketone and alcohol, had less product selectivity. Although the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid with Ni/LY char under hexane solvent had no acetone or isopropyl alcohol in the system, isopropyl palmitate was lightly presented in liquid product. The reason could be discussed by the ability of CC cleavage of Ni-based catalyst [54]. Palmitic acid might be partly cleaved into the small structures then the light substance that had carboxyl group (COOH) was converted into alcohol (ROH) via hydrogenolysis and reacted with long chain fatty acid (palmitic acid) then transformed into fatty acid ester. However, isopropyl palmitate under hexane solvent was less produced than under acetone solvent. So, Ni/LY char catalyst under acetone solvent was appropriated for production of bio-based chemical from palmitic acid in order to produce ester especially isopropyl palmitate. Isopropyl palmitate is an interesting compound that widely uses in personal care and cosmetic products [66]. In addition, isopropyl palmitate can be used as an excellent solvent for mineral oil, silicone and lanolin [67]. In view of automotive and fuel industries, isopropyl palmitate is the branched chain fatty acid esters that can optimize the biodiesel properties such as enhancing its lubrication to reduce friction caused by engine components and reducing the pour point and cold filter plugging point, hence could increase the service life of the engine and enhance the low temperature fluidity [68]. To discuss the outstanding oxygenated compound, isopropyl palmitate, with other methods, the interesting isopropyl palmitate productions via various esterification are listed in Table 4 . In view of biocatalyst, Barsé et al. [69] studied the isopropyl palmitate production using immobilized enzyme (CAB-P(S-co-DVB)/P(S-co-DVB)) as a biocatalyst via esterification of palmitic acid and isopropyl alcohol, they reported that the result under hexane solvent showed the conversion of palmitic acid in 35.7%. Another example of biocatalyst, Silva et al. [70] investigated the lipase G immobilized on poly (styrene-co-divinylbenzene), the optimum conditions with 85.68% conversion were found at 17.07 %m/v biocatalyst concentration, 2.71:1 M ratio (palmitic acid to isopropyl alcohol) in 12 h of reaction. Although the use of biocatalyst illustrated the green production of isopropyl palmitate with satisfying conversion, the refined enzyme preparation and enzyme immobilization procedures were elaborate, and long time in reaction were restriction of methods. The synthesis of hybrid silica gel-‘succinic acid-zinc acetate’ (SG-SAZnA) as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce isopropyl palmitate via esterification was studied by Chin et al. [8], the results showed that the conversion of palmitic acid was about 70% at molar ratio of 5:1 (isopropyl alcohol to palmitic acid), reaction temperature of 140 °C for 4 h. While the homogeneous catalyst was investigated by Chandane et al. [9], they reported that the 92% conversion was occurred in the conditions of 7:1 M ratio of isopropyl alcohol to palmitic acid at 82 °C for 6 h with p-toluene sulfonic acid. The use of homogenous catalyst in esterification showed higher conversion of palmitic acid than heterogeneous catalyst. However, the esterification using homogeneous catalyst had some problems about high alcohol consumption, catalyst separation from product, and neutralization of catalyst. In case of non-catalyst, the two-step noncatalytic method for isopropyl palmitate synthesis was investigated by Fu et al. [66]. First-step acylation reaction, palmitic acid and thionyl chloride were reacted to form palmitoyl chloride then isopropyl alcohol was added in second-step to react with palmitoyl chloride for generating isopropyl palmitate. The conversion of palmitic acid to isopropyl palmitate via the two-step noncatalytic process were highly presented of 99.72%. Nevertheless, sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid were also generated from reactions, which could be a significant problem for operators of refining and chemical process units, and environment, due to their corrosive and toxicity. In this study, catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid with Ni/LY char catalyst under hexane solvent showed the conversion of palmitic acid of 31.41% and isopropyl palmitate was generated in yield of 8.64%, while under acetone solvent the conversion of palmitic acid was 67.15% and isopropyl palmitate was generated in yield of 34.83%. Thus, the catalytic hydrotreating over Ni/LY char catalyst using acetone solvent in this study was a one of the attractively alternative routes to produce ester, especially isopropyl palmitate with rather high conversion of palmitic acid and good in yield. It consumed that the reactants produced isopropyl palmitate simultaneously in one-pot reaction. In addition, Ni/LY char was a heterogeneous catalyst with particle size in rage of 0.5–1 mm, after reaction the spent catalyst could be easily removed from liquid product by filtration. Focusing on limonite catalyst, the outstanding oxygenated group was alcohol generated from the hydrotreating under the non-polar solvent, that was more than half of the total products. In addition, the notable compound was n-pentadecanol in product selectivity of 37.05%. n-Pentadecanol is a long-chain alcohol (LCOH) or fatty alcohol, which is used as an ingredient in industrial chemicals, lubricating oils, and consumer products. Moreover, Cowan-Ellsberry et al. reported that LCOHs were commonly used as intermediates in surfactant and detergent productions [71]. General pathway of fatty acid to alcohol by catalytic hydrotreating under H2 atmosphere that has modified following several researches [14,54,72] is shown in Fig. 12 a. The pathway is begun when the carboxyl group (–OH) of fatty acid is cleaved and removed in form of water by hydrogenolysis, then the fatty acid is converted to aldehyde. Finally, the aldehyde is converted to alcohol by hydrogenation. This conversion, alkyl group is not changed the number of carbon atom. Nevertheless, in our research work, n-pentadecanol was not generated following general pathway as Fig. 12a. Palmitic acid (C16) was converted to n-pentadecanol (C15) with carbon loss in one atom, the proposed reaction pathway is shown in Fig. 12b. In the case of hydrotreating over limonite, referring the elemental analysis in section 3.2.2, limonite ore was compounded with iron metal. Moreover, the XRD patterns confirmed the form of metallic compound during reaction was magnetite (iron (II, III)). The presence of Fe-based catalyst might promote the decarbonylation of palmitic acid to n-pentadecanol with one carbon atom less than the reactant due to CO removal, this reason was supported by the study of Bian et al [73]. For discussing on the fatty alcohol productions, many researches reported that fatty alcohol mostly produced via hydrogenation of fatty acid and methyl ester of fatty acid using various fatty acids as the reactants. Zhang et al. [12] studied the hydrogenation of lauric acid (C12H24O2) with Cu/ZrO2 at reaction temperature of 330 °C, 83.12% yield of lauryl alcohol (C12H26O) was produced with conversion of lauric acid of 88.75% at 5 h. While lauryl alcohols were generated from hydrogenation using Cu/MgO and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts with yield of 97.6% and 99.2%, respectively, and conversions of lauric acid were 96.9% and 98.9%, respectively, at reaction time of 3 h. Wang et al. [74] investigated hydrogenation of methyl palmitate with NiIn IMC/SiO2 catalyst in fixed-bed reactor, 1-hexadecanol was produced in yield of 94.8% with conversion of methyl palmitate of 100%. Furthermore, Huang et al. [11] studied Pd–Cu/diatomite catalyst for hydrogenation of methyl palmitate under initial H2 pressure of 5.5 MPa at reaction temperature of 300 °C with n-heptane solvent in autoclave reactor, 1-hexadecanol in yield of 21.9% with conversion of methyl palmitate of 99.9% was generated at reaction time of 7 h. Schlipkoter et al. [75] investigated the two-step method for producing myristyl alcohol (C14H30O). For first step, the esterification of myristic acid (C14H28O2) with myristyl alcohol using immobilized lipase B as biocatalyst was operated in bubble column to generate myristyl myristate (C28H56O2). Second-step, the hydrogenation of myristyl myristate was carried out under 3.5 MPa H2 at temperature of 100 °C in autoclave reactor, two molecules of myristyl alcohol was generated with conversion of myristyl myristate of 100% at reaction time of 18 h. Nevertheless, two-step method was intricate for transferring substances due to difference reactor for each step, had long reaction time in step of hydrogenation. To discuss the fatty alcohol producing from palmitic acid, Table 5 presents the various conditions and catalyst species in production of fatty alcohol via hydrogenation of palmitic acid. Zhang et al. [12] investigated in situ hydrogenation of palmitic acid to fatty alcohol over Cu/Al2O3 catalyst in presences of methanol and water as solvent and hydrogen sources. Under reaction temperature of 330 °C for 1 h, the conversion of palmitic acid was 66.67%, and 1-hexadecanol was obtained with 57.86% yield as the product. While the study of Luo et al. [76] reported that 1-hexadecanol was produced in selectivity of 99.7% with conversion of palmitic acid of 99% from Ru-Sn/ SiO2 catalyst under 4 MPa H2 at hydrogenation temperature of 240 °C for 4 h using dodecane solvent in autoclave reactor. For the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid over limonite catalyst using hexane solvent in this study, the conversion of palmitic acid was 100%, and n-pentadacanol was produced in yield of 37.05%. The limonite catalyst provided the main selectivity on n-pentadecanol as a unique product with mild conditions (low temperature and pressure) while the Cu/Al2O3 and Ru-Sn/ SiO2 catalysts led the products as same in 1-hexadecanol. The reaction temperature used in this study, 300 °C, was lower than Zhang et al., and the H2 pressure of 3 MPa in this study was lower than Luo et al. Limonite catalyst was prepared by grinding, washing and drying, it had no need for a supported material, and the price of limonite ore was cheap. So, the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid over limonite catalyst under hexane solvent is a one of available routes for producing fatty alcohol especially n-pentadecanol. From above results it can be concluded that the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid over Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts can produce the interesting bio-based chemicals that apply to be the midstream, downstream and/or final oleochemicals in various industries such as personal care products, automotive, detergent and surfactant. In this research work, it is noted that the bio-based chemical products from palmitic acid by catalytic hydrotreating over Ni/LY char catalyst was dominantly in isopropyl palmitate that was 13.6 times in ambience of acetone and was 8.7 times in ambience of hexane when compared with limonite catalyst. Meanwhile, limonite catalyst focused on n-pentadecanol in ambience of hexane that was 57.9 times when compared with Ni/LY char catalyst. This discussion infers that the cheap catalysts had the considerable feasibility to produce the bio-based chemicals in groups of ester and alcohol. In this research, acetone in analytical reagent grade was used for avoiding the impurity factor in experimental study. Based on the results of this work, the bio-acetone is interesting to further develop this research finding for future work in order to emphasize on sustainable green manufacturing. The use of bio-acetone as a bio-solvent can support the green production of bio-based chemicals. The bio-acetone can be produced from the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation of glucose that derived from hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials [77,78]."
9,Liquid product characterization,"3.3 Liquid product characterization To characterize the liquid products from catalytic hydrotreating, the products from catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid with different catalysts at the conditions of 3 MPa H2, 300 °C reaction temperature and 5 h reaction time were considered. In Table 6 , the elemental compositions of liquid products are presented. When compared with raw palmitic acid, the products of catalytic hydrotreating from Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts were shown the increasing weight percentages of carbon and hydrogen, and the decreasing weight percentage of oxygen. The calculated HHV from Eq. (4) was increased when carbon and hydrogen were increased, and oxygen was decreased that related with the study of Jafarian [79]. Compared with palmitic acid, the HHVs of products were increased (from 31.36 to 32.11–34.13 MJ/kg), Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts with acetone solvent showed the HHVs of 32.43 and 32.58 MJ/kg, while HHVs of products from hexane solvent were 32.11 and 34.13 MJ/kg, respectively. The degree of deoxygenation (DOD) was calculated from O/C atomic ratio, DODs of liquid products from limonite with acetone and hexane solvents were higher than DODs of products from Ni/LY char in both solvents. From the study of Oh et al. [80], except to HHV improvement, the oxygen removal could improve the fuel properties of the products including viscosity and acidity. However, the products from both catalysts had the low HHVs when compared with crude oil [81]. The H/C and O/C atomic ratios are indicated in Table 6 and are plotted as Van Krevelen diagram (Fig. 13 ). The products of all conditions showed the increasing H/C ratio and the decreasing O/C ratio, excepting limonite with acetone showed the lower H/C ratio than raw palmitic acid. limonite catalyst with hexane solvent showed the highest H/C ratio at 2.08 and the lowest O/C ratio at 0.04. Although, the products had high H/C ratios, but the O/C ratios were still high when compared with O/C ratio of crude oil (~0). As results by discussion in the events about the products have low HHVs, DODs and O/C ratios, it can be concluded that the products from catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid using Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts are inappropriate for using as fuel, but they are more suited for bio-based chemicals."
10,Conclusions,"The textural properties including BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of the prepared low-cost catalysts were 308 m2/g, 0.188 cm3/g and 2.43 nm, respectively, for Ni/LY char and were 95 m2/g, 0.3 cm3/g and 12.59 nm, respectively, for limonite. Catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid over low-cost catalysts could produce bio-based chemical such as intermediate and downstream oleochemicals including their derivatives, especially fatty acid ester and fatty alcohol. Under the initial H2 pressure of 3 MPa at reaction temperature of 300 °C and reaction time of 5 h, Ni/LY char catalyst with acetone solvent resulted the conversion of palmitic acid of 67.15%, the liquid product was compounded with esters in yield of 42.43% that had isopropyl palmitate as main component with 82% of ester. Consequently, use of Ni/LY char under polar aprotic solvent could produce the isopropyl palmitate more than non-polar solvent of 13.6 times. The oleochemical product from limonite catalyst with hexane solvent was principally distributed in alcohol group with yield of 51.84%, the n-pentadecanol was a major compound with yield of 37.05% that was 57.9 times when compared with Ni/LY char. The properties of liquid product from Ni/LY char and limonite catalysts exhibited the increases of carbon and hydrogen elements, and the decrease of oxygen. The DODs of liquid products from Ni/LY char catalyst were in range of 19.11–27.44%, and for liquid products from limonite catalyst were in range of 42.89–65.15%. The HHVs of both catalysts were in range of 32.11–34.13 MJ/Kg. However, the HHVs of products are lower than crude petroleum oil for 1.34 times so they are inappropriate for using as fuel, but they are more suited for bio-based chemicals. In conclusion, from the experimental results the catalysts have the reasonable feasibility to apply in the catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid for production of bio-based chemical, especially in oxygenated compounds including ester, ketone and alcohol groups. This present research work indicates the 3 advantages: 1) low-cost catalysts have the feasibility and potentiality for producing bio-based chemicals with low temperature under the appropriate conditions such as polar or non-polar solvents, and H2 pressure. 2) Ni/LY char catalyst can be applied for catalytic hydrotreating of palmitic acid in order to obtain high content of esters. 3) The cheap Fe-based catalyst, limonite ore, is high potential to generate the product in main compound of alcohols."
