0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has the advantages of zero carbon footprint and high energy density, which is regarded as an ideal sustainable energy carrier to replace the consumption of fossil fuels in the future [1–3]. Electrochemical water-splitting hydrogen production, which can be driven by sustainable energy sources such as wind or solar energy [4,5], has attracted much attention because of its simplicity, repeatability, and environmental friendliness [6–8]. High-performance electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) processes are mainly limited to noble metal-based composite materials [9], such as Pt [10], Ir [11], Re [12], Ru [13], Pd [14], Rh [15] and other precious metals, because of their optimal hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔG H*) [16]. However, high cost and scarcity restrict their large-scale industrial application. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) [17,18], has become the most widely studied as high efficient alternatives to noble-metal for electrocatalytic water-splitting electrocatalysts [19]. Among them, the earth-abundant tungsten-based phosphides (WP2, WP) [20–22] because of its excellent conductivity and stability, was widely investigated recently. The self-supported three-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanoparticle films, nanorod, nanowire arrays and nanosheet arrays, have large increased specific surface areas and abundant reactive sites [23]. Meanwhile, the feature of polymer-binder-free processes is able to maintain the advantage of the high intrinsic conductivity of the catalysts [24,25]. For instance, Zhang et al. [26] prepared ultra-fine WP nanoparticles with W-rich vacancies through a self-exothermic reduction strategy at low temperature (300 °C), which exhibits a superior HER activity in acidic solution. Wu et al. [27] synthesized a coral-like WP nanorod array on W foil by in situ oxidation followed phosphorization reactions. The overpotential was 109 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the Tafel slope was 79.8 mV dec−1. Similarly, three-dimensional mesoporous semi-metallic WP2 nanowire arrays were prepared on the carbon cloth with an efficient hydrogen evolution performance [28]. In addition, the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔG H*) on the surface of the catalyst has an important effect on the HER performance. Heteroatom doping [29] is one of the most effective ways to manipulate electronic structures and adjusting hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy [30]. Ni-doped WSe2 [31] was proved to have a lower hydrogen adsorption energy and enhanced catalytic activity compared with WSe2. In the respect, the electrode design based on edge-rich morphology and heteroatom doping is a promising strategy to promote the activity for HER. As far as we know, the well-fabricated WP2 nanosheet arrays doped with transition metal Ni heteroatoms for efficient HER have not been reported. In this paper, we demonstrate a successful strategy for nickel-doped WP2 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (Ni-WP2 NS/CC) synthesis by in-situ phosphating reaction of nickel-doped WO3 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (Ni-WO3 NS/CC). The as-prepared cathode materials show well electrocatalytic performance and stability, with an overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec−1, and the electrocatalytic activity maintained for at least 25 h without significant attenuation. Compared with pristine WP2, the prepared Ni-WP2 NS/CC shows more exposed active sites and lower charge transfer resistance, and their electrochemical activity and stability are better than most reported congeneric electrocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that the Ni doping affects the intrinsic properties of the WP2 thereby significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance. This work offers a valuable way for synthesizing efficient 3D heteroatom doped catalytic electrodes and would help to understand the doping effect on the electrocatalytic performance of tungsten phosphide."

Tungsten (VI) chloride (WCl6, 99.9%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, ≥99.7%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·H2O, ≥99.0%), oxalic acid (C2H2O4·2H2O, ≥99.5%), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, ≥99.0%) and cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, ≥99.0%) were purchased form Xi Long Chemical Co., Ltd. A commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst and 5 wt% Nafion were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. All of the chemicals were used directly without further purification treatment."
3,Synthesis of Ni-WO3 NS/CC,"2.2 Synthesis of Ni-WO3 NS/CC The WO3 nanosheet arrays were synthesized on carbon cloth via a simple alcohol-thermal method. Firstly, the pieces of CC (1 × 3 cm2) were hydrophilic treatment by dilute nitric acid (volume ratio of 60%) at 100 °C for 10 h in the oven and then washed with plenty of deionized water. Then, the carbon cloth was ultrasonically washed with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 30 min, respectively. After that, 0.6 g oxalic acid, 0.3 g WCl6 (0.76 mM) and 1.8 mg NiCl2·6H2O (0.0076 mM) were dissolved in 40 mL of ethanol, then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave with the pre-cleaned CC placed vertically in the reaction kettle and inject argon about fifteen seconds to drive air out. Ni-WO3 NS/CC was obtained via solvothermal reaction at 180 °C for 10 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was naturally cooled down to room temperature, and taken out the CC washed several times with ethanol and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Finally, the dried CC was annealed in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain the precursor 1% Ni-WO3 NS/CC. We adjusted the amount of NiCl2·6H2O to synthesize different amounts of nickel-doped tungsten trioxide, which denoted as 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5% Ni-WO3 NS/CC. The same method was followed in synthesis of Co-WO3 NS/CC under the same conditions."
4,Synthesis of Ni-WP2 NS/CC,"2.3 Synthesis of Ni-WP2 NS/CC The Ni-WP2 NS/CC was fabricated via an in-situ solid-phase phosphating reaction under argon atmosphere in a double-zone tube furnace. In brief, 2.0 g of NaH2PO2·H2O was located at upstream heating zone and heated to 300 °C, while a piece of Ni-WO3 NS/CC was located at the downstream center heating zone, where the temperature was maintained at 700 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. During the reaction, the Ar gas flowing at a constant rate of 20 s.c.c.m (standard-state cubic centimeter per minute). After naturally cooling to room temperature, the product Ni-WP2 NS/CC was obtained. Different nickel content Ni-WP2 NS/CC phosphating from corresponding precursor Ni-WO3 NS/CC was denoted as 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5% Ni-WP2 NS/CC. The elemental composition (Molar percentage of Ni/W) of product results from EDS spectra are showed in Table S1. The Co-WP2 NS/CC cathodes were also synthesized using the same method."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystal structures of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) using PANalytical X'Pert3 powder diffractometer (XRD) (Cu K α radiation, λ = 1.54056 Å) in the range of 10 to 90°. The microstructure of as-prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-638OLV) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) attachment. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was taken by ESCALAB 250Xi system. The binding energy for C 1s peak at 284.8 eV was used as the reference for calibration."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were performed with a three-electrode system in the 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution at room temperature (25 °C) by electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments): The Ni-WP2 NS/CC (exposed area of 1 × 1 cm2) serves as the working electrode, a 5 mm diameter graphite rod as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was purged with N2 for at least 30 min before the electrochemical test. For comparison, the commercial Pt/C loaded on C cloth (Pt/C/CC) was performed the electrochemical measurement. Pt/C/CC electrode was prepared through 10 mg of Pt/C (20 wt%) catalysts were dispersed in a mixed solution contained 480 μL ethanol/water (v/v = 230/250) and 20 μL Nafion (5 wt%) solution, mixed by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then a certain amount of the dispersed solution was loaded on a piece of carbon cloth to obtain working electrode Pt/C/CC. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was measured at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in the 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. All the measured potentials were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. SCE) + 0.2412 V + 0.059 × pH. The potentials were corrected for IR compensation (90%) was applied for the electrochemical measurements for the ohmic resistance of the solution. The polarization curve was plotted as an overpotential (η) vs. logarithmic current (log j) to obtain a Tafel plot. The Tafel slope (b) was calculated by fitting the linear portion of the Tafel plot to the Tafel equation (η = b log (j) + a). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize the electrolyte resistance and capacitance of electrocatalysts. The AC impedance measurements were conducted at a constant AC voltage with an amplitude of 5 mV and the frequency over range of 105 to 0.1 Hz. The cyclic voltammetry curves measured from − 0.25 to 0.25 V (vs. RHE) for 3000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A continuous and stable overpotential with current density of −10 mA cm−2 for 25 h was conducted to test the electrochemical stabilities of the electrocatalyst."
7,Theoretical calculations,"2.6 Theoretical calculations All the geometry optimization and Gibbs free energy calculations for adsorption of hydrogen based on DFT were carried out by using the CASTEP module of Materials Studio 8.0 in this paper. We use the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional method to describe the electronic exchange correlation effects and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials to represent core-valence electron interaction. In addition, we selected the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) project as the minimization algorithm and spin-polarization was employed for all calculations. And the semiempirical DFT-D correction of Grimme method was adopted for dispersion corrections. We choose Pt (111) and WP2 (100) as slab models in our calculations, all surface models were simulated with a three-layers thick and the two-layers were fixed, with a vacuum thickness of ~15 Å. The cutoff energy of 500 eV is used for the plane-wave basis set and the self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance was 2.0 × 10−6 eV per atom. The Monkhorst-Pack mesh k-points of 2 × 2 × 2 and 2 × 2 × 1 were employed for the geometric optimization of the bulk and the slab models of WP2, and 6 × 6 × 1 was used for the correlative computations of the Pt (111), respectively. The convergence tolerances were set to 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom for energy, 0.01 eV Å−1 for maximum force, 0.02 GPa for maximum stress, and 5.0 × 10−4 Å for maximum displacement, respectively. The different adsorption free energies of H were determined by the following formula: ΔG H* = ΔE H* + ΔZPE − TΔS, where ΔE H*, ΔZPE, and ΔS represent the binding energy, zero-point energy and entropy change of H* adsorption, respectively. According to the previous literature, the value of (ΔZPE − TΔS) can be approximated to 0.24 eV, so the free energy of the adsorbed state can be estimated ΔG H* = ΔE H* + 0.24 eV. ΔE H* can obtain from the equation: ΔE H* = E H*+slab − E slab − 1/2E H2, where E H*+slab and E slab were the total energy of slabs molecule with and without hydrogen atom, E H2 denotes the total energy of a gas phase H2 molecule."
8,Results and discussion,"As schematic diagram showed in Fig. 1 , Ni-WP2 NS/CC was synthesized via a two-steps process: a solvothermal growth of Ni-WO3 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth, followed by in-situ phosphating reaction to synthesize Ni-WP2 NS/CC. Fig. 2 (a) displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of pristine WP2 and Ni-WP2 NS/CC with different nickel content doping. We found that the main diffraction peaks of WP2 and Ni-WP2 at 20.97°, 26.11°, 31.10°, 36.10°, 43.95°, and 46.60° were well indexed to the standard PDF card of monoclinic WP2 (PDF No. 76–2365). As shown in the XRD pattern that the diffraction peaks of 0.5%, 1% and 3% Ni-WP2 with no obviouschangecompared with pristine WP2, indicating that such a small amount of dopant was not capable of taking an obvious effect on the crystalline nature of pristine WP2. The part of the amplification of XRD pattern in Fig. 2(b) shows that the diffraction peak of the ( 1 - 11 ) crystal plane is slightly shifted toward the low angle direction, which is attributed to the lattice expansion of WP2, arise from the replacement of tungsten ions (ionic radius: 0.6 Å) by slightly large nickel ions (ionic radius: 0.69 Å). As for 0.5%, 1% and 3% Ni-WP2, no other Ni-related diffraction peaks appeared, but XPS spectrum showed a trace presence of Ni species in the sample. These results indicate that the dopant Ni have entered into the WP2 lattice and dispersed uniformly. However, with the further increase of nickel content, the new diffraction peaks at 15.6°, 34.87°, 44.9°, 55.1° appeared in 5%, 10%, 20% and 50% Ni-WP2 (Fig. S1), which means NiWP2 (PDF#09–0453) is formed. For all samples at a broad peak at 2θ of 26° and 43° were ascribed to carbon cloth. In addition, we investigated the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of precursor Ni-WO3 with different Ni contents. As shown in Fig. S2(a) of pristine WO3 and Ni-WO3 at 23.12°, 23.58°, 24.38°, 33.26°, and 34.18° are matched well with (002), (020), (200), (022) and (202) planes of the standard PDF card of monoclinic WO3 (PDF#71-2141). It is also observed that the strongest diffraction peak of the (200) crystal plane at 24.2° was slightly shifted to a lower angle and the intensity was decreased (Fig. S2b). Furthermore, Fig. S2(c) showed the main diffraction peaks of Ni-WO3 at 19.3° and 30.8° were well indexed to (100) and ( 1 - 11 ) planes of the standard monoclinic NiWO4 (PDF No. 72–1189). The main diffraction peaks of 50% Ni-WO3 at 37.25°,43.27°,62.88° and 75.41° were well indexed to (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of the standard PDF card of cubic NiO (PDF No. 47-1049). This indicates that monoclinic NiWO4 and cubic NiO would emerge when the dopant Ni concentration is too high. The morphology of the synthesized Ni-WP2 NS/CC was investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images of 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC (Fig. 2c, d, f) show the nanosheet arrays were vertically oriented grown on the carbon cloth and interconnected with each other. Compared with the Ni-WO3 NS/CC (Fig. S3), the nanosheet arrays morphology of Ni-WP2 NS/CC (Figs. S4–S8) is retained, with amounts of thinner nanosheets growing perpendicular on the carbon cloth, which would be beneficial for electrocatalytic activity. EDS mapping (Fig. 2g–i) and spectrum (Fig. S9) reveal that the 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC was composed of P and W with atomic ratio (P/W) about 2:1, and contained a trace amount of Ni elements. Fig. 2(e and j) show the TEM and HR-TEM images of 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC clear crystal lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.299 nm and 0.285 nm, which are corresponding to the (110) and ( 1 - 11 ) planes of the monoclinic WP2, respectively. And the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Fig. 2(k) shows the discrete and bright diffraction spots, indicating the high crystallinity of the 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC, which can be indexed to the ( 2 - 01 ), (110), ( 1 - 11) and (111) planes of WP2, respectively. Fig. 3 (a) displays the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey pattern of 1% Ni-WP2 and WP2 NS/CC with P, W, and Ni element peaks to analyze the surface chemical element composition. From the P 2p spectrum of 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC in Fig. 3(b), three fitting peaks at 129.8, 130.7 and 134.05 eV are distinctly perceived in the spectrum. The main peaks at around 129.8 and 130.7 eV correspond to P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 in WP2, respectively [32]. While the weak peak at 134.05 eV is indexed to features of P–O arising from superficial oxidation in air. Fig. 3(c) displays the high-resolution W 4f spectrum, with two strong peaks fitting at 31.98 and 34.1 eV are assigned to W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 of WP2 [33]. The two weak peaks at 36.9 and 38.85 eV are attributed to W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 of WO3 due to surface oxidation in air. For Ni 2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 3(d), two peaks with binding energies at 853.92 and 871.3 eV are attributed to Ni 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 belongs to the P–Ni [34,35]. Moreover, Fig. S10 shows the XPS survey spectra of pristine WP2 and Ni-WP2 with different contents as well as high-resolution spectra comparison of P, W and Ni elements. The W 4f of Ni-WP2 in Fig. S10(b) shows that the binding energy (BE) of W 4f 7/2 peak is shifted to a higher energy direction compared to the pristine WP2, which is related to their electronegativity [36]. Doping of Ni will lead to the electron transfer between the metals and the positive migration of the W 4f 7/2 peak indicates that the partial electron transfer of W to Ni [37,38]. While the P 2p 3/2 peak (Fig. S10c) of Ni-WP2 shows a slight negative shift, which indicates the stronger electron interactions between the dopant Ni and WP2, the site of P can easily gather electrons to participate in the catalytic reaction, and correspondingly improve the electrocatalytic performance [39–41]. These changes also indicate the electron interactions of the transfer from positively charged (δ +) W atoms to negatively charged (δ −) P atoms in WP2 [42]. These prove that the Ni has been implanted into WP2, matching our previous XRD results. We evaluated the HER performance ofthe prepared samples in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. 4 (a) shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of WP2, Ni-WP2, and Pt/C catalysts with IR compensation at a sweep rate of 2 mV s−1. Pt/C catalyst shows impeccable electrocatalytic performance with overpotential close to 0. The pristine WP2 has an overpotential of 145 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, 1% Ni-WP2 has the optimal HER performance compared with the pristine WP2, the overpotential reduces to 110 mV, while the overpotential of 0.5%, 3% and 5% Ni-WP2 at 10 mA cm−2 was 129, 116 and 124 mV, respectively. In addition, Fig. S11 shows the XRD patterns and polarization curves of 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC catalysts obtained by phosphating at different temperatures, which shows that it has the best performance at 700 °C. The Tafel plot depicted the dependence of steady-state current densities on various overpotentials, and it is an important parameter used to evaluate the main mechanism in the HER reaction process. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Tafel slopes of 0.5%, 1%, 3% and 5% Ni-WP2 were smaller than the pristine WP2 (80 mV dec−1), which are 73, 65, 69 and 71 mV dec−1, respectively, indicating that they are more favorable for the HER process. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) was designed to investigate the dynamics of interfacial charge-transfer. We calculated the charge transfer resistance (R ct) by means of the Nyquist plots in Fig. 4(c), in which the R ct are fitted and the equivalent circuit model is shown in the illustration. EIS fitting result revealed that the R ct of the WP2 and 1% Ni-WP2 are 5.4 and 4.0 Ω, respectively, indicating that the 1% Ni-WP2 has a more efficient electron transfer process. The data comparing the HER performance of WP2 doped with different contents of nickel was displayed in Table S2. These results prove that a small amount of heteroatom doping can increase the performance of materials, but excessive dopants will introduce impurity phases and reduce its electrochemical properties. We further investigated the stability of 1% Ni-WP2. As shown in Fig. 4(d), after 3000 cycles continuous CV tests in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, the polarization curve has negligible attenuation compared with the initial curve. The time-dependent current density curve of 1% Ni-WP2 maintained a constant current density of ~10 mA cm−2 catalytic activity for at least 25 h without any attenuation, implying that it has high stability in acidic electrolyte. Fig. S12(a and b) shows the current density versus time (i–t) curves of WP2 shows a slight attenuation of catalytic activity for at least 20 h under a static overpotential of 150 mV, which can be attributed to the proton consumption in the test electrolyte and the barrier of the hydrogen release process by the hydrogen bubbles attached to the electrode surface. The XRD patterns of WP2 and 1% Ni-WP2 NS/CC before and after long-term stability test indicated that the structure of WP2 and 1% Ni-WP2 was not apparently changed during the HER reaction (Fig. S12c and d). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) can be estimated from the double-layer capacitance obtained by linear fitting the non-faraday region of the CV curves [43]. As shown in Fig. 4(f), we estimated the C dl value of WP2 and Ni-WP2 from corresponding CV curves (Fig. S13a, b) to be 41.3 and 73.8 mF cm−2, respectively, indicating that the Ni-doped WP2 catalyst possesses nearly 2 times the active site of an electrochemical reaction than WP2. The turnover frequency (TOF) is the most significant indicator of the intrinsic activity per site of electrocatalysts and is related to the number of H2 molecules released per second per active site [38]. We further calculated the turnover frequency as shown in Fig. S14, where the TOF values of WP2 and Ni-WP2 were 0.07 and 0.09 s−1 at 200 mV, respectively, indicating that Ni dopants can inherently improve the catalytic activity of WP2. Additionally, the faraday efficiency of H2 production was also measured, 1% Ni-WP2 catalyzes the HER providing nearly 92% Faraday yield in acidic electrolyte (Fig. S15). In addition, we investigated the effect of cobalt doping on the hydrogen evolution performance of WP2 NS/CC. Fig. S16(a) shows the polarization curves of 1%, 3% and 5% Co-WP2 catalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4. 1% and 3% Co-WP2 show better HER performance compared to pristine WP2, affording the current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 122 and 128 mV, and the corresponding Tafel slope were 75 and 88 mV dec−1 (Fig. S16b), respectively. As the doping amounts of cobalt increases, its electrochemical performance becomes increasinglyworse. A comparison of HER performance for Co-WP2 NS/CC was shown in Supplementary Table S3. It is well known that HER activity is closely related to the free energy of absorbate H* and adsorption–desorption of hydrogen [44,45]. Consequently, the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔG H*) is widely served as a dominating descriptor to evaluate HER performance in acid electrolytes [46]. As previously suggested the ‘volcano relationship’ by Nørskov [47], for which a low value of ΔG H* ≈ 0 is considered to be the optimal candidate electrocatalyst for HER, because the appropriate ΔG H* can balance the reaction barrier of the adsorption and desorption steps [48]. To fundamentally understand the underlying mechanisms of the effect of Ni doping in WP2 on HER catalytic activity, the ΔG H* value of WP2 and Ni-WP2 was calculated by DFT on the theoretical research. We use the geometric optimization calculation by CASTEP, the doped model is to replace the W atoms in the pure WP2 model slab with Ni atoms, where hydrogen is adsorbed at the metal site, metal bridge site and phosphorus site as shown in Figs. 5 (a) and S17. Fig. 5(b) shows the calculated Gibbs free energy values of different sites of WP2 and Ni-WP2. DFT calculation results show that the ΔG H* value of Pt (111) is approximately −0.09 eV, which is very close to thermoneutral and the value reported in previous literature [49]. The optimal ΔG H* value at the W site of the Ni-WP2 is about −0.18 eV compared with the WP2 (−0.42 eV) decreased significantly, which is very beneficial for HER. The bridge site and P site of Ni-WP2 are −0.28 and −0.33 eV, respectively, which are smaller than W site. For the pure WP2, the ΔG H* values at the bridge site and P site are more negative for −0.59 and −0.76 eV, respectively. Figs. S18 and S19 show the top and side views of the optimized H atom at different adsorption sites on WP2 and Ni-WP2. The lower values of ΔG H* indicate the stronger adsorption capacity for H on the catalysts surface, which would severely limit the desorption step of hydrogen and against H2 generation [50]. Fig. 5(c) shows the d-orbital partial density of states (DOS) on the surface atoms of Ni-WP2 and WP2 to analyze the effect of Ni doping on the electronic structure. The d-band center of Ni-WP2 after Ni doping is further away from Fermi level relative to that of WP2.According to the d-band theory [51–53], a lower d-band center implies the weakening hydrogen adsorption capacity to the catalytic surface, which will help to enhance HER activity. Moreover, the calculated density of states (DOS) of pristine WP2 (100) and different numbers of Ni atoms to replace the W atoms in the pristine WP2 (100) were displayed in Fig. S20, we observed that the d-band of 1Ni-WP2 is the most deviating from the Fermi level, where the number of Ni atom accounts for about 1.38% of the total number of atoms in the calculation model, which was more consistent with our experimental results. To further explore the effect of Ni doping on the electronic structure of the WP2 system, we conducted an electron density difference calculation to determine the electron density distribution of W and P atoms around the doped Ni and to understand the change in electron density during the adsorption process. The electron density difference of Ni-WP2 and WP2 was shown in Fig. S21, where the red and blue colors represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. It can be seen from the figure that strong electron accumulation was observed around Ni atom and electron depletion was observed around W atoms, so it can be explained that the transfer of electrons from W atoms to Ni atom increases the electron density around Ni atom. Compared with pure WP2, the electron density of W caused by doped Ni will be lower, so the binding energy of W will be higher. The electron density around P is higher, so the binding energy of P will be lower. In addition, it can be seen from both figures that the electrons are depletion around the W atoms between P and W, and electrons are accumulated around the P atoms, so the transfer of electrons from W to P occurs. These results are consistent with our previous XPS analysis results. These results indicate that Ni doping can effectively reduce the energy barrier and regulate electronic structure, so adjusting the inherent electronic structure by heteroatoms is an effect way to promote HER activity of the electrocatalyst."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully synthesized Ni-WP2 NS/CC through phosphating Ni-WO3 NS/CC. The prepared optimized Ni doping on WP2 NS/CC has the advantages of more exposed active sites and lower charge transfer resistance, and show higher electrocatalytic activity and stability than pristine WP2. DFT calculations further prove that the doping of Ni regulated the electronic structure of WP2, weaken the H adsorption on the surface of WP2, and decrease the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy closer to the thermoneutral state, thereby enhancing HER activity. This study provides a valuable way for synthesizing efficient 3D heteroatom doped catalytic electrodes, and helps to understand the doping effect on the electrocatalytic performance of tungsten phosphide."
