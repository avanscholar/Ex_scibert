0,Introduction,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation is the major contributing factors in in the development and progression of different types of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty [1–3]. An increase in the number of VSMCs in the neointima of the blood vessels due to VSMC proliferation is one of the major characteristics of these lesions. Occlusion of the blood vessels can eventually lead to severe clinical problems, such as thrombosis or embolus formation [1–4]. Phospholipids are critical to mediate key signaling pathways by recruiting or activating cytosolic proteins on various membrane compartments [5–7]. Among these signaling phospholipids, phosphatidic acid (PA) has been increasingly recognized for its roles in various cellular functions including proliferation and migration [8–10]. A source of signaling PA is generated from phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Although PLD has been shown to be activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and angiotensin II in VSMCs [11–15], it remains unclear how the two PLD family members, PLD1 and PLD2 [9,16], function in physiological and pathological conditions in the vascular system. We have recently shown that PLD2 is required for injury-induced neointima formation through the regulation of VMSC migration [17]. An outstanding question is whether PLD1 and PLD2 undergo a similar type of regulation, and mediate the same signaling and cellular functions in VSMCs. Activations of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT signaling pathways are critical to the progression of VSMC proliferation as a result of vascular injury [18,19]. It has been shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediates the activation of the ERK and AKT pathways downstream of multiple cellular stimuli, such as angiotensin II and PDGF, in multiple cell types [20–22], and is critical to VSMC proliferation and injury-induced neointima formation [23,24]. ROS levels can be regulated by many signaling pathways through different mechanisms; therefore, defining the signaling pathways that regulate ROS levels in the vascular system has been an active research topic [25–28]. In the current study, we show that PLD1 is critical to VSMC proliferation and injury-induced neointima formation in the carotid artery ligation mouse model. Deletion of Pld1 blocks the activation of both ERK and AKT pathways though regulating intracellular ROS levels. These data demonstrate that PLD1 contributes to pathological vascular remodeling and suggest the potential of using PLD1 as a new therapeutic target for diseases related to vascular injury."

3,Animal and carotid artery ligation,"2.2 Animal and carotid artery ligation All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International guidelines, and have been approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The generation of Pld1 knockout mice was described previously [30] and has been backcrossed to a C57BL/6 background. The generation of Pld2 knockout mice in this study has been described before [17,31]. The knockout allele has been always maintained in a hemizygous background to avoid potential functional compensation. The carotid artery ligation was performed on both male and female wild-type (wt) and Pld1 −/− mice at the age of 10 weeks as described [32]. In brief, the left common carotid artery of anesthetized mice was ligated with 5/0 sutures proximal from the carotid bifurcation. The cut of the skin was closed with auto clips. The mice were sacrificed and perfused with formalin at 4 weeks after the ligation surgery."
4,Histological analyses,"2.3 Histological analyses The ligated left common carotid artery was collected, fixed with formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks. The cross-sections with 5-μm thickness were collected at 0.5 mm distally from the ligation site for the following analysis of morphology and histology. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical staining were performed using standard protocols. Briefly, paraffin sections were first deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. The sections were then boiled in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 10 min for antigen retrieval. After the sections were cooled down, endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation of the slides with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min. After blocked in 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, slides were incubated with desired primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies, and visualized with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit from Vector laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA). Neointimal and medial areas were quantified by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The medial area was measured by subtracting the area defined by the internal elastic lamina from the area defined by the external elastic lamina, and the neointimal area was measured as the difference between the area inside the internal elastic lamina and the luminal area. The number of immunohistochemically stained cells positive to an antibody was blind counted."
5,Cell culture and measurement of cell proliferation and ROS levels,"2.4 Cell culture and measurement of cell proliferation and ROS levels Primary VSMCs were isolated from mouse superior mesenteric artery as previously reported [33] and cultured in in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10437-036) from Millipore Sigma. Cells were passed to new plates by trypsin digestion when they became confluent, and used for experiments at 4–6 generations. To measure cell proliferation, VSMCs were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 2 ml medium. At different days after plating, cells were detached by trypsin digestion and viable cells identified by trypan blue exclusion were manually counted by a hemocytometer under a Nikon light microscope. To manipulate intracellular ROS levels, primary VSMCs were treated with 1 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to scavenge ROS for 30 min, or different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to increase ROS for 15 min. Cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS were measured by flow cytometry after loading the cells with 5μM DCFH-DA [2-(2,7-dichloro-3,6-diacetyloxy-9H-xanthen-9-yl)-benzoic acid] (85155, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and 2 μM MitoSOX Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (M36008, Thermo Fisher Invitrogen), respectively."
6,Western blotting,"2.5 Western blotting Total cell lysates were directly lysed with 1 × SDS loading buffer plus phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM NaF, 3 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 4 mM sodium tartrate) and protease inhibitor cocktails (04-693-116-001, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and sonicated with 3–4 bursts of 5–10 s each to break DNA. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were transferred to a new tube. About 2 million cells were used for protein extraction. Twenty μg of boiled protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry transfer. After blocked with 1% casein or Odyssey blocking buffer, the membranes were simultaneously probed with total and phospho-primary antibodies, followed by appropriate Alexa680- and IRDye 800-conjugated secondary antibodies. To detect additional protein targets, the parallel membranes with the same loading were probed with different antibody combinations. No stripping and re-probing were performed. The fluorescent signals of targeted proteins were detected by an Odyssey infrared imaging system from Li-Cor Biotechnology (Lincoln, NE) as described previously [34,35]. The intensity of band of interest was quantified using Odyssey Image Studio Lite. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with the same conclusion."
7,Statistics,"2.6 Statistics The statistical differences were evaluated between control and each of the treatments using either Mann-Whitney U test (all analyses except Fig. 5C and D) or two-tailed Student's t-test (Fig. 5C and D). All data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001."
8,Results,
9,PLD1 deficiency inhibits injury-induced neointima formation after carotid artery ligation,"3.1 PLD1 deficiency inhibits injury-induced neointima formation after carotid artery ligation To evaluate the role of PLD1 in injury-induced vascular remodeling, we performed common carotid artery ligation procedure in wt and Pld1 −/− mice [32,36]. In this model, artery ligation causes cessation of blood flow, thus promoting VSMCs in the media of artery to migrate into the intima, where their subsequent proliferation leads to the formation of neointima and a narrowing of the lumen. Ligation of the left common carotid artery led to a significant neointima growth 4 weeks after the procedure in wt female mice, but much less neointima growth in Pld1 −/− female mice, as measured by the ratio of neointima and media (Fig. 1A & B). Similarly, neointima formation was also significantly inhibited in Pld1 −/− male mice compared with those in wt male mice 4 weeks after carotid artery ligation (Fig. 1C & D). Since PLD1 deficiency inhibited neointima formation in both male and female mice, our experiments were performed in both genders thereafter."
10,PLD1 contributes to VSMC proliferation,"3.2 PLD1 contributes to VSMC proliferation The accumulation of VSMC in the intima of injured artery is mainly caused by the proliferation of VSMCs migrated from the media of the artery [36,37]. To determine the contribution of VSMC proliferation to neointimal formation in Pld1 −/− artery, we performed immunohistochemical staining for PCNA, which is a proliferation marker, in the neointima and media at 4 weeks after carotid ligation injury. There is a significant reduction in the percentages of PCNA-positive VSMCs in neointima and media in Pld1 −/− mice as compared to wt mice (Fig. 2A & B). Consistent with this in vivo data, removal of Pld1 also reduced the number of primary VSMCs in culture, whereas removal of Pld2 had no effect (Fig. 2C). We previously showed that PLD2 inhibitor but not PLD1 inhibitor reduced VSMC migration in basal as well as angiotensin II- and PDGF-stimulated conditions [17]. To confirm the inhibitor result, we performed cell migration assay using primary VSMCs isolated from wt and Pld1 −/− mice. In consistence with inhibitor treatment, there is no difference in PDGF-stimulated migration between wt and Pld1 −/− VSMCs (Fig. 2D). Together, these results suggest PLD1 deficiency reduces VSMC proliferation, which contributes to the inhibition of neointima formation in injured Pld1 −/− artery."
11,PLD1 deficiency reduces the activity of ERK and AKT in VSMCs,"3.3 PLD1 deficiency reduces the activity of ERK and AKT in VSMCs ERK and AKT signal pathways activated by growth factors are important for VSMC proliferation and cell cycle progression [38,39]. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms through which PLD1 promotes VSMC proliferation and injury-induced neointima formation, we performed immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 and AKT as measurements of their activation status. In consistent with proliferation results (Fig. 2), the phosphorylation levels of both ERK1/2 and AKT are reduced in injured artery from Pld1 −/− mice (Fig. 3A–F). The reductions in the activities of both ERK1/2 and AKT are intrinsic to VSMCs, since their phosphorylation levels are also reduced in primary Pld1 −/− VSMCs (Fig. 4A ). The regulation of ERK1/2 and AKT activity is PLD isoform-specific. The phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and AKT are only reduced in Pld1 −/− VSMCs, but not in Pld2 −/− VSMCs (Fig. 4A). PLD1 inhibitor-treated but not PLD2 inhibitor treatment reduced the phosphorylation levels of both ERK1/2 and AKT (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the regulation of their activities is dependent on PLD1 catalytic activity. These results also support our previous finding that PLD2 is not involved in the regulation of VSMC proliferation [17]."
12,Decreased ROS levels in Pld1 −/− VSMCs,"3.4 Decreased ROS levels in Pld1 −/− VSMCs Vascular injury leads to increased ROS levels, which are responsible for the increased VSMC proliferation in artery [26–28,38,39]. PLD activity has been reported to mediate ROS levels in several cell types [40–43]. To test whether PLD1 is involved in the regulation of ROS levels in injured artery, we performed immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydroxy-2-noneal (4HNE), which is widely used as a marker for cellular oxidative stress levels in immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections [44,45]. The intensity of 4HNE antibody staining is significantly lower in both intima and media of injured Pld1 −/− artery as compared to that in wt artery (Fig. 5A & B). To directly test that PLD1 is involved in the regulation of ROS levels in VSMCs, we compared the levels of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS in cultured primary wt and Pld1 −/− VSMCs by DCFH-DA and mitoSOX Red staining, respectively. In consistent with the in vivo finding, both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS levels in Pld1 −/− VSMCs are significantly lower than those in wt VSMCs (Fig. 5C)."
13,PLD1-dependent ROS production contributes to the activation of ERK and AKT in VSMCs,"3.5 PLD1-dependent ROS production contributes to the activation of ERK and AKT in VSMCs Our findings that PLD1 deficiency reduces ROS production as well as the activities of EKR and AKT suggest that PLD1 may regulate the activities of ERK and AKT through ROS production. To test this hypothesis, we first measured the active status of ERK and AKT in Pld1 −/− VSMCs treated with hydrogen peroxide by Western blotting. We found that hydrogen peroxide increased the phosphorylation levels of both ERK and AKT in a dose-dependent manner in Pld1 −/− VSMCs (Fig. 6A ). In addition, the reduction in the active status of ERK and AKT in Pld1 −/− VSMCs can be similarly rescued by hydrogen peroxide treatment in VSMCs isolated from both male and female (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that PLD1 regulation of ROS signaling is not specific to genders. This result is consistent with our observation that PLD1 deficiency in both genders reduced neointimal formation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of ERK and AKT can be reduced by the treatment of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) in wt VSMCs (Fig. 6B). Together, these data support that activations of ERK and AKT are downstream of PLD1-generated ROS."
14,Discussion,"VSMC proliferation in the arterial wall plays an important role in the development of postangioplasty restenosis and atherosclerosis [1–3]. However, the complex mechanisms regulating this process are not fully understood. As far as we know, the role of PLD1 in vascular injury has not been reported. In the present study, we examined the involvement of PLD1 in vascular remodeling and the mechanism through which PLD1 regulates VSMC proliferation in primary VSMCs and neointima formation in a well-established carotid artery ligation mouse model. We found that PLD1 is essential for intimal hyperplasia (Fig. 1). We did not find that PLD1 affects the migration of VSMC using PLD1 inhibitor in the previous study [17], which is confirmed by using Pld1 −/− primary VSMCs stimulated with PDGF in the current study (Fig. 2C). The mechanism through which PLD1 promotes neointimal formation in injured artery is different from PLD2, which promotes neointima formation through regulating VSMC migration but not proliferation [17]. Our results indicate that although both PLD1 and PLD2 are involved in vascular injury-induced neointima formation, they function through distinct mechanisms, i.e., proliferation and migration, respectively. Pld1 knockout mice show no detectable developmental abnormality [30], suggesting that PLD1 mainly play a critical role in the pathological conditions, and that it may represent a potential target for vascular dysfunction with limited toxicity. PLD isoform-specific inhibitors have been developed [46], and may be further improved by rationale design based on newly solved human PLD1 and PLD2 structures [47–49]. Application of these inhibitors in the treatment of vascular injury should be tested in the future studies. The production and removal of ROS are tightly regulated by several enzymatic systems in the cytosol and mitochondria. Superoxide anions can be produced by extracellularly or by cytochrome C oxidase in mitochondria, membrane-associated NADPH oxidase, or 5′-lipoxygenase in the cytoplasm, and are rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide by the action of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase enzymes. ROS is removed by catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and thioredoxin peroxidase (peroxiredoxins) [28,38,50]. Under normal physiological conditions, ROS destruction by antioxidant enzymes maintains a controlled activity of signaling cascades. In contrast, in vascular disease, the production of ROS exceeds endogenous antioxidant capacity, leading to aberrant production of ROS, which in turn results in abnormal physiological responses [25,28,38,50]. While the exact molecular mechanism through which PLD1 regulates ROS levels in VSMCs remains to be further investigated, it appears that the role of PLD1 is context-dependent. We reported before that PLD1 inhibition reduced mitochondrial ROS, but had no effect on cytoplasmic ROS, in glucose-starved cancer cells [41]. In the current study, we found that PLD1 deficiency inhibits both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ROS in primary VSMCs in normal culture condition. The regulation of different sources of ROS by PLD1 and the underlying mechanisms may depend on cell types or extracellular environments. PLD1 but not PLD2 regulates adhesion-dependent ROS production stimulated by phorbol ester, chemoattractant, and Fcγ receptor [40]. Both PLD1 and PLD2 promote the membrane association of p47 and ROS production in lung endothelial cells under hyperoxia [42]. However, we were not able to observe any change in p47 membrane association in Pld1 −/− primary VSMCs (supplemental Fig. 2). PLD1 can also bind to peroxiredoxin II (Prx II) upon phorbol ester stimulation [51]. It is still unclear whether this binding changes Prx II activity, thus regulating ROS levels. In the future studies, it would be critical to determine how PLD1 or PLD1-generated PA is engaged in different effectors to regulate compartmentalized ROS production in response to various upstream stimuli. Early studies relied heavily on the use of primary alcohols or overexpression of catalytically inactive PLD mutants to inhibit PLD activity, which has been proven to be problematic [52,53]. Therefore, the roles of PLD in regulating ROS levels need to be carefully evaluated using more reliable reagents, such as newly developed PLD1-specific inhibitors and PLD1 knockout cells in more recent studies [30,40,41]. At present, the exact molecular mechanism by which ROS regulates proliferation is not fully understood. PLD activity is upregulated by growth factors in VSMCs [11,13], which is a major proliferative signaling pathway in these cells [11]. ERK and AKT pathways are two major downstream signaling pathways upon the activation of growth factor signaling [38,39]. Our data show that PLD1 deficiency reduces VSMC proliferation through inhibiting the activity of both ERK and AKT pathways, suggesting that PLD1 may be involved in the early signaling events in growth factor signaling. The activation of PLD1 leads to the production of signaling lipid PA on various membrane compartments. PA can function directly as a signaling molecule to recruit downstream effectors [9,16]. Interestingly, ROS is also an essential player in growth factor signaling in VSMCs [21,25,28]. These results support that regulation of ROS levels by PLD1 may play a critical role in growth factor signaling during vascular. In summary, our study reveals a new role for PLD1 in VSMC function. PLD1 promotes the activation of ERK and AKT through the production of ROS. Inhibition of this process impairs VSMC proliferation and neointima formation after vascular injury. Our findings support that the PLD1-ROS-ERK/AKT signaling pathways play a crucial role in injury-induced vascular remodeling and might be a therapeutic target for vascular diseases."
