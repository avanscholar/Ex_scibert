0,Introduction,"Biodegradable packaging materials have recently gained attention in the food industry due to consumer’s awareness of associated environmental benefits. Among them, polyvinyl-alcohol (PVOH) is a water soluble petroleum-based polymer with very good optical properties, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability and good film-forming ability to be used as food packaging (Aslam, Kalyar, & Raza, 2018; Shi et al., 2008; Tian, Yan, Rajulu, Xiang, & Luo, 2017). These intrinsic characteristics make PVOH an interesting material for the development of active packages or coatings of great interest in the food area. The development of active materials aiming at maintaining or enhancing the quality and safety of packaged food through the incorporation of antimicrobial and/or antioxidant natural compounds is, in fact, an active research area (Chen et al., 2018; Fang, Zhao, Warner, & Johnson, 2017; Kwon, Chang, & Han, 2017; Neo et al., 2013). However, the most widely used processing methods for the development of packaging materials require high temperatures which could compromise the active properties of many of antimicrobials and antioxidant compounds, as most of them are thermosensitive (i.e. essential oils) (Atarés & Chiralt, 2016; Ramos, Jiménez, Peltzer, & Garrigós, 2012). To counteract this problem, electrospinning has been lately proposed as an alternative to develop active food packaging materials (Estevez-Areco, Guz, Candal, & Goyanes, 2018; Fabra, Lopez-Rubio, & Lagaron, 2016; Lin, Mao, Sun, Rajivgandhi, & Cui, 2019; Pinheiro Bruni et al., 2020). By means of this technique, encapsulation structures can be developed by applying electrostatic forces between a solution of the biopolymer and a grounded collector without the need of using high temperatures for drying the materials, as the solvent is evaporated during the flight of the solution towards the collector due to the whipping of the biopolymer caused by the high voltage application (Anu Bhushani & Anandharamakrishnan, 2014; Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, this technology provides several advantages in preserving the functionality of the active compound encapsulated within the electrospun fibers. As active compounds, essentials oils (EOs) have attracted extensive research, because apart from being a natural product, they have also demonstrated numerous biological activities like, for instance, antimicrobial, antioxidant or anti-inflammatory amongst others (Brahmi et al., 2016; Gómez-Estaca, López de Lacey, López-Caballero, Gómez-Guillén, & Montero, 2010; Yen, Hsieh, Hsieh, Chang, & Wang, 2015). Specifically, essential oils from bay (Laurus nobilis) and rosemary (Rosmarinus oﬃcinalis) have received much attention because of their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (Göksen, Fabra, Ekiz, & López-Rubio, 2020; Ojeda-sana, Baren, Elechosa, Juárez, & Moreno, 2013; Ramos, Teixeira et al., 2012). However, one of the drawbacks of PVOH as a matrix to include the essential oils is its high water solubility which limits its application in real foods with high water activities. To overcome this problem, several strategies have been carried out in the literature, including mixtures with other polymers (Çay, Miraftab, & Perrin Akçakoca Kumbasar, 2014; Peresin et al., 2014; Yang, Li, & Nie, 2007) and the use of cross-linking agents (Shi et al., 2008) in order to improve the functionality and applicability of PVOH-based materials. Crosslinking can be achieved applying either physical (heat treatment, gamma irradiation, ultraviolet) or chemical agents (glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde) (Mansur, Sadahira, Souza, & Mansur, 2008; Miraftab, Saifullah, & Çay, 2015). However, most of these treatments have been reported to be harmful. For instance, migration of metal ions, used as cross-linkers, could exert cytotoxic effects (Lee & Mooney, 2001). Other crosslinking chemical agents such as glutaraldehyde are highly toxic and are prone to leach out from the packaging material to the food, thus compromising food safety (Lin, Gu, & Cui, 2018). As an alternative, citric acid (CA), a food-grade compound (Suganthi et al., 2018), has been proposed in this work as a crosslinking agent to keep the integrity of the PVOH materials once in contact with high water activity food products (Stone, Gosavi, Athauda, & Ozer, 2013). This proof-of-concept study proposes a new route for the development of novel active packaging structures of interest in food preservation. Therefore, based on the considerations outlined above and potential applications of active films, the objectives of the present work were to develop PVOH active films by means of electrospinning and to investigate the influence of the crosslinking treatment on the morphology, thermal and physicochemical properties of the developed structures. Finally, their application as a potential antimicrobial and antioxidant food packaging material has been evaluated in chicken breast fillets."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Laurus nobilis essential oil (LEO) and Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil (REO) were obtained according to Göksen et al. (2020). Specifically, the composition of REO and LEO was previously determined (Göksen et al., 2020), and the main compound found in both essential oils was 1,8 cineole (55.80 % and 69.87 %, respectively). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) was purchased from Plásticos Hidrosolubles S.L. (Valencia, Spain) and citric acid (CA) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A). The strain of Listeria monocytogenes CECT 4032 (NCTC 11994) was obtained from the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT, Valencia, Spain). Oxford-Listeria-selective agar base was purchased from Thermo Scientific-Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK). Fresh chicken breast slices were purchased from a local supermarket in Valencia (Spain) and immediately transported to the laboratory and kept under refrigerated conditions."
3,Preparation of electrospinning solutions,"2.2 Preparation of electrospinning solutions PVOH solutions were prepared by dissolving 14 g PVOH powder in 100 mL distilled water at 60 °C under magnetic stirring at 300 rpm. Aqueous solutions containing CA were similarly prepared and then, 5 g of CA were incorporated into the PVOH solution under stirring for another 2 h. Aqueous solutions containing LEO or REO essential oils (EOs) were prepared by adding 10 g of each EOs into the as-prepared PVOH aqueous solution and stirred for 2 h to obtain homogeneous solutions. Compositions and nomenclature of each formulation are compiled in Table 1 ."
4,Characterization of electrospinning solutions,"2.3 Characterization of electrospinning solutions The Wilhemy plate method was used to measure the surface tension of the biopolymer solutions using the in EasyDyne K20 tensiometer (Krüss GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The viscosity of the electrospinning solutions was measured using a rotational viscosity meter (Visco Basic Plus L) from Fungilab S.A. (San Feliu de Llobregat, Spain) using spindle no TL1 at 12 rpm. The electrical conductivity and pH of the solutions were determined using a conductivity meter (XSCon6) and pH meter (XS pH50) from Labbox (Barcelona, Spain). All measurements were done in triplicate at 25 ± 2 °C."
5,Electrospinning process and post-treatment of the fibers,"2.4 Electrospinning process and post-treatment of the fibers The electrospinning solutions were loaded into 5 mL plastic syringes connected to an 18-gauge stainless steel nozzle with horizontal configuration. This process was carried out by an electrospinning apparatus including high-voltage (0–30 kV) power supply (Acopian, USA), a syringe pump (KD Scientific, USA) and a collector plate. The flow rate of the solutions, applied voltage and tip-to-collector distance were set to 0.15–0.20 mL/h, 18 kV and 10 cm, respectively, based on preliminary optimization trials. The electrospinning process was carried out under ambient conditions (20 °C and 58 % RH). After the electrospinning process, the samples were cured in an oven at 170 °C for 10 min to foster materials’ crosslinking with/without CA. The temperature and time were fixed based on screening experiments."
6,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The morphology of the nanofibers was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800, Matsuda, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and working distance of 8−16 mm. The samples were coated with gold-palladium sputtering under vacuum (Pinheiro Bruni et al., 2020). After analysis, the diameters of the fibers from SEM micrographs were measured using ImageJ software (Image J, NIH, Maryland, USA)."
7,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis,"2.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis Electrospun fiber mats were characterized using FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Rheinstetten, Germany). The scans were recorded in the spectral range from 650 to 4000 cm−1. All spectra were collected with a resolution of 4 cm−1 by averaging 16 scans."
8,Thermal properties of electrospun fibers,"2.7 Thermal properties of electrospun fibers Thermal properties of the electrospun mats were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Perkin Elmer, Inc., DSC 7) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (TA Instruments model Q500 TGA). For TGA, the samples (approximately 10 mg) were heated up from 25 °C to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. TGA curves express the weight of the sample as a function of temperature. For DSC analysis, samples (between 2−5 mg) were heated of 10 °C min−1 from 20 to 290 °C under nitrogen gas and using an empty pan as a reference. Indium was used for calibration and the thermograms from an empty pan were used for correcting the slope of the thermal scans from the samples. All tests were carried out, at least, in duplicate. The degree of PVOH crystallinity was calculated from the ratio: (1) χc (%) = (ΔHm/ΔHm°) × 100 where ΔHm° = 138.6 J g−1 is the melting enthalpy for a perfect 100 % PVOH crystal (Jiang, Qiao, & Sun, 2006)."
9,Challenge tests,"2.8 Challenge tests Fresh chicken breast fillets (0.80 g carbohydrate, 22.18 g protein, 1.54 g fat content per 100 g) were purchased from a local market in Valencia (Spain) and transferred to the laboratory within 1 h and kept under refrigerated conditions. These fillets were aseptically cut into pieces of 10 g and covered with the electrospun structures. The prepared samples were then placed in sterile petri dishes and petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 °C up to 7 days. The physicochemical and microbiological analyses were performed, in triplicate, at 0, 1, 4 and 7 days of storage. The antioxidant analysis was carried out, in triplicate, at the beginning and at the end of the storage time. Four different groups were prepared: uncovered fillets (control) and fillets covered (directly contacting the pieces of chicken) with the cross-linked fibers (PVOHc, PVOHcLEO, PVOHcREO). The pH and color parameters of the samples were measured at each storage time. Briefly, chicken breast samples (10.0 g) were homogenized with 90 mL of distilled water for 1 min using a homogenizer (MICCRA GmbH, Heitersheim, Germany). Then, the homogenate was used for determination of pH value (Gonzales-Fandos, Herrera, & Maya, 2009). Color parameters (CIE L*, a* and b*) of chicken breast samples were determined using Chroma Meter-CR 400 (Konica Minolta Japan). The lipid oxidation was evaluated by means of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). The TBARS value was evaluated with the 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) distillation method described by Fontes-Candia, Erboz, Martínez-Abad, López-Rubio, and Martínez-Sanz (2019)) with a slight modification. Briefly, 10.0 g of chicken breast meat were homogenized with 30 mL of water. The homogenate was transferred to a distillation flask (500 mL) with 65 mL of water and then the pH was adjusted to 1.5 with using HCl (4 N). Ethanolic propyl gallate (10 %, 1 mL), EDTA (10 %, 1 mL), and a drop of anti-foaming agent were added to mixture. The flask was connected to a Soxhlet apparatus and the mixture was boiled until 50 mL of distillate were gathered. After distillation, 5 mL of TBA reagent (0.02 M TBA in 90 % acetic acid) were added to 5 mL of the distillate and placed in a boiling water bath for 40 min of reaction. As a control, 5 mL of distilled water were used instead of the distillate. After cooling at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 535 nm in a spectrophotometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA). TBARS value was calculated by multiplying the absorbance readings by a factor of 7.8 and expressed as mg malondialdehyde (MDA)/kg meat. The inhibition of lipid oxidation was determined after 7 days as follows: (2) I n h i b i t i o n % = ( T B A R S b l a n k - T B A R S e l e c t r o s p u n ) ( T B A R S b l a n k - T B A R S d a y 0 ) × 100 In this equation, TBARSday 0 corresponds to the TBARS in the uncovered fresh chicken breast meat at day 0 and TBARSblank and TBARSday 7 refer to the TBARS in the control sample (uncovered fresh chicken breast) and in the different meat samples covered with the electrospun materials after 7 days of refrigerated storage, respectively. The antimicrobial assays were carried out as follows: chicken breast fillets (10 g) were sterilized by immersion in ethanol 70 % for 5 min. Before packing, the samples were soaked in the bacteria suspension of L. monocytogenes (approximately 108 CFU/mL) and left under a laminar flow safety cabinet for 15 min for attaching inoculums onto chicken breast meat surface. Later on, the samples were packaged individually with the nanofibers (5 × 5 cm) previously sterilized with UV light for 30 min. Packaged and control samples (unpackaged) were placed into sterile petri dishes and sealed with parafilm and then stored at 4 °C. L. monocytogenes presence in the different samples was evaluated by plate counting at different time intervals (0, 1, 4 and 7 days) during cold storage."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis All results were presented as the average ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS software (version 17.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) using Tukey's test."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Development and characterization of active ﬁbers containing LEO or REO,"3.1 Development and characterization of active ﬁbers containing LEO or REO Initially, the physicochemical properties of the electrospinning solution were evaluated and correlated with the morphology of developed fibers. Different sizes and morphologies can be obtained through electrospinning processing of biopolymer solutions depending on solution properties (surface tension, viscosity, electrical conductivity) and process parameters. In this work, CA was added as a PVOH crosslinking agent (in combination with an annealing process required for effective crosslinking) in order to avoid the disintegration of electrospun fibers once they would be in direct contact with food, since most of them present high water activity. PVOH-based solutions with and without CA or EOs were initially characterized and the results are compiled in Table 1S of the Supplementary Material. pH values of the PVOH solutions were around 5.3 at room temperature and they significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with the incorporation of CA due to its acidic nature. The addition of CA resulted in a slight increase in the viscosity values of the biopolymer solution, in agreement to that previously reported by Esparza, Ullah, Boluk, & Wu, (2017), although it did not significantly affect the average diameters of the fibers obtained. In general, the incorporation of EOs made the fluid solutions more viscous (greater apparent viscosity values) than the neat PVOH and PVOHc solutions (see Table 1S) which, surprisingly, resulted in thinner fibers (see Table 2S in the Supplementary Material) thus suggesting that, in this case, the diameter of the fibers was mainly governed by the electrical conductivity of the electrospinning solutions. Concerning the conductivity values, the addition of CA solution provoked a sharp increase (p < 0.05) in electrical conductivity of the PVOH solution (1081 μS/cm), probably ascribed to the ionic nature of this carboxylic acid in solution. A similar trend was observed in PVOH-EOs solutions containing CA, favoring the formation of slightly thinner fibers during electrospinning as the greater conductivity facilitates jet stretching, as inferred from Table 2S and Fig. 1 . Regarding the surface tension values, PVOH-aqueous solutions showed surface tension values significantly lower than those of the solvent (72 mN/m). Likewise, the incorporated EOs behaved as surfactants, further decreasing the surface tension values of the solutions. A slight increase in surface tension was observed upon CA addition when compared with their counterparts prepared without the natural crosslinking agent. As deduced from the solution properties, surface tension did not play a major role on the morphology of the fibers which were mainly governed by the increase in the electrical conductivity of the CA-containing solutions, favoring the formation of thinner fibers. The SEM images of PVOH-based fibers (with and without CA and EOs) are displayed in Fig. 1. Table 2S of the Supplementary Material gathers the average diameter of the electrospun fibers before and after the annealing process used to promote the PVOH-CA crosslinking. The size measurements from the SEM micrographs revealed that the average diameter of fibers decreased with the incorporation of both essential oils (LEO/REO) and CA, mainly ascribed to the increase in electrical conductivity. Interestingly, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the average diameter was clearly observed in PVOH and PVOH/EOs films after the annealing process. In contrast, this increase was significantly lower if the electrospun coatings had CA, suggesting that interactions between the PVOH and CA preserved the morphology and porous structure of the coating, and thus the integrity of the fibers, to a greater extent. The increase in the average diameter of the electrospun fibers in annealed films prepared without CA can be attributed to a partial melting of the PVOH matrix and subsequent aggregation of the PVOH-based fibers during the heat treatment, as it is clearly observed in the images B, E and H of Fig. 1A. As most food products present high water activity, the integrity of the PVOH-based electrospun fibers upon water immersion was also evaluated and their morphology after immersion and subsequent drying was analyzed by SEM in order to evaluate the effect of crosslinking on water resistance. As expected, when CA was not used, the fibrillar morphology of the electrospun PVOH/EOs films was completely lost after water immersion (Images C, F and I of Fig. 1A), as previously reported by other authors (Çay & Miraftab, 2013; Destaye, Lin, & Lee, 2013). In contrast, the cross-linked films kept their fibrillary morphology (although a certain swelling was observed as deduced from the increase in the average fiber diameter- see Table 2 ), providing a better stability and evidencing the efficacy of the annealing process in promoting the esterification reaction between carbonyl groups in CA and hydroxyl groups in PVOH (see Fig. 1B). In general, crosslinking reduces the interstitial spaces between the biopolymer chains, thus reducing molecular motion and preventing extensive swelling of the electrospun fibers (Çay & Miraftab, 2013; Miraftab et al., 2015; Santiago-Morales, Amariei, Letón, & Rosal, 2016). Infrared spectroscopy was used to evaluate the changes in the molecular structure of the different electrospun mats obtained. As very similar spectra were obtained for the mats with the two different EOs, only the ones containing LEO are shown for clarity. ATR-FTIR spectra of the neat and LEO-loaded PVOH or PVOH/CA electrospun films before and after the annealing process are gathered in Fig. 2 . The spectrum of neat PVOH, as previously described, showed an intense band between 3600 and 3200 cm−1 ascribed to the stretching of OH groups and other characteristic bands between 2840 and 3000 cm− 1, attributed to the stretching C–H from alkyl groups and between 1757−1710 cm−1 corresponding to the CO stretching and CO from acetate groups remaining from PVOH (Andrade, Barbosa-Stancioli, Mansur, Vasconcelos, & Mansur, 2008; Mansur et al., 2008). For comparison purposes, the different spectra were normalized to the vibrational band at 1232 cm−1, assigned to the stretching vibration of CO arising from alcohol and ester groups (Esparza, Ullah, Boluk, & Wu, 2017). Upon EOs incorporation, no significant shifts were observed in the spectral bands of the neat PVOH or PVOH/CA independently of the final compositions of the films, thus, suggesting that EOs were not chemically interacting with the PVOH network. However, a decrease in the OH stretching band was seen upon EO incorporation. Annealing is known to promote crystal formation in polymeric materials. From Fig. 2A, it can be clearly seen that annealing caused an increase in the OH stretching band centered at 3300 cm−1, probably indicating stronger hydrogen bonding interactions. Another remarkable change, was the intensity increase in the range from 1000−1100 cm−1 (CO stretching in COH groups and COC groups), thus probably indicating that this area could arise from crystallizable chain segments in PVOH. In contrast, additional spectral changes were observed in the samples containing CA (Fig. 2B). Similar to what was observed in the mats without CA, the heat treatment caused an increase in the OH stretching band and in the range from 1000−1100 cm−1, both probably indicating increased molecular order in the PVOH chains. But apart from these changes, an increase in the bands from 1700 to 1750 cm−1 arising from ester and carboxylic bonds was also observed in the heat-treated samples, thus confirming the crosslinking reaction. Presumably, during the heat treatment process, CA is first dehydrated to its anhydride and subsequently, the ester group is formed through the ring opening of the citric acid anhydride by the −OH groups present in the PVOH backbone and this process is repeated to complete the crosslinking (Nikfarjam, Taheri Qazvini, & Deng, 2014). The thermal stability of the electrospun fibres was also assessed by thermogravimetric analysis. As very similar thermograms were obtained for the mats with the two different EOs, only the ones containing LEO are shown for clarity. Fig. 3 shows the thermogravimetric curves of the neat and LEO-loaded PVOH or PVOH/CA electrospun films before and after the annealing process. Neat PVOH showed a first stage of mass loss (25–150 °C), attributed to the loss of water molecules (both weakly and strongly interacting with the polymer). The second phase of mass loss (200–375 °C) has been associated to the decomposition of the side chains of PVOH and the third stage ranging from 375 to 500 °C has been mainly related with polymer main chain degradation (Van Etten et al., 2014). Thus, the last two stages were responsible for the mass loss of around 92 %, which corresponded to the structural decomposition of PVOH. Considering that the neat LEO and REO had only one degradation peak (∼ 88 °C) corresponding to the evaporation of the volatile compounds present in the essential oils (Göksen et al., 2020), the shift to higher temperature (∼ 120 °C) observed when the EOs were incorporated within the PVOH matrices, suggest that the polymer increased their thermal stability. Interestingly, a new degradation peak at around ∼ 185 °C (see Fig. 3) appeared in the samples containing CA, which probably corresponds to the degradation temperature of neat CA, as it has been previously reported to occur in a single-step between 160 and 220 °C (Wyrzykowski, Hebanowska, Nowak-Wiczk, Makowski, & Chmurzyński, 2011). After the annealing process, a smoother peak was found at higher temperature (∼ 162 °C) in PVOH-LEO-AN, evidencing that EOs were mostly degraded due to the annealing treatment carried out at 170 °C, at a much higher temperature than the degradation temperature of both LEO and REO. It was also observed that the main degradation peak of PVOH was shifted to lower temperatures in PVOH-EOs-AN samples, indicating that the presence of LEO or REO detrimentally affected the degradation temperature of neat PVOH. Interestingly, a new degradation peak centered at ∼ 89 °C was found in annealed samples containing CA, even in those prepared without EOs, suggesting the presence of less heat-stable molecules which were probably formed during the annealing, which degraded at this temperature. Furthermore, one of the main changes that occurred after the annealing process was related to the stability of the PVOH macromolecules cross-linked with the CA. In fact, the thermal degradation during the second and third weight loss stage occurred more gradually and started at higher temperatures when CA was present, thus suggesting that the interactions between CA and PVOH had a protective impact on the thermal stability of the developed electrospun fibers. Thus, TGA results suggest that crosslinking had a positive effect on the thermal stability of the polymer material, while the inclusion of the essential oils had the opposite effect. The degree of crystallinity has important effects in the physical properties of biopolymers. Thus, the thermal properties of the PVOH and PVOH/CA films and the active films containing EOs were also investigated by DSC analysis. Table 2 compiles the temperature of melting (Tm), as well as the melting enthalpy (ΔHm) and crystallinity (Xc) obtained from the first heating run. ΔH can be used to estimate the crystallinity of a polymer sample. Interestingly, just after electrospinning, i.e. without an annealing process, the fibers obtained were amorphous and no thermal transition was seen through DSC. In contrast, the annealing process promoted crystal development, which was different depending on the initial composition of the fibers. As seen in Table 2, the presence of EOs, increased the melting point of the annealed fibers, indicating that the crystals present in the materials were bigger or more perfect. This could be ascribed to a plasticization effect of the oils, facilitating chain mobility and packing during the annealing process, fact which led to higher melting temperature and higher melting enthalpy. In contrast, Lan et al. (2019) stated that the addition of d-limonene in PVOH matrices hindered crystallization of the PVOH molecules, thus resulting in lower melting temperature and enthalpy which was ascribed to the d-limonene impeding hydrogen bonding not only within PVOH molecules but also between PVOH molecular chains. Similarly, Hernández-López et al. (2019) reported an ΔH decrease when pine essential oil was added to PLA-based composite fibers, indicating that the incorporation of the dispersed phase into the matrix reduced the crystallization of the biopolymer matrix. It should be stressed, however, that in the thermal data provided in the mentioned works was obtained after erasing the thermal history of the materials, while in our case the thermal parameters were obtained during the first heating ramp. Regarding the effect of citric acid incorporation, similarly no transition was observed before annealing, while after this heat treatment crosslinking was promoted, thus limiting the ability of polymeric chains to reorganize, thus, resulting in lower melting points, although similar crystallinity values. This implies that although the amount of crystals formed during annealing was similar in the samples with or without citric acid, they were smaller or less perfect when crosslinking took place."
13,Challenge tests,"3.2 Challenge tests Challenge tests on chicken breast fillets were carried out to ascertain the antioxidant and antimicrobial effectiveness of the active fiber mats on real food samples. Although TGA analysis revealed that EOs were mostly degraded during the annealing process, the functional properties of the developed electrospun fibers were tested to determine if the LEO or REO remaining after the annealing process had antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. In fact, previous works carried on EOs loaded-casting films revealed antilisterial activity even though the losses of volatile compounds during the film drying ranged between 39 and 99 %, depending on the EOs and EOs:biopolymer ratio (Sánchez-González, Vargas, González-Martínez, Chiralt, & Cháfer, 2011). Initially, the physicochemical quality of the packaged and unpackaged samples was evaluated in terms of pH and color parameters. Table 3S from the Supplementary Material shows the changes in the pH values during the storage in the different chicken samples covered by electrospun structures. The initial pH value of the fillet was ∼ 5.97. The pH development in the chicken breast fillets can be affected by both the microbial growth and the oxidation process which occurred to a different extent in the different packaged samples. As expected, the pH of unpackaged samples slightly increased during the storage time, ranging between 5.97 and 6.81. This agrees with the fact that foods stored under aerobiosis and rich in proteins and free aminoacids, such as chicken breast fillets, present a pH increase as the number of microorganisms that cause spoilage increases (Křížek, Vácha, Vorlová, Lukášová, & Cupáková, 2004; Ntzimani, Paleologos, Savvaidis, & Kontominas, 2008), as it will be detailed below. Furthermore, the proteolytic activity also results in the production of basic compounds which could contribute to the increase in pH (Vinci & Antonelli, 2002). In contrast, the pH of the packaged samples did not vary significantly during the storage time or it was even slightly decreased, confirming that these samples were better protected. Table 3 shows the changes in the color parameters (L*, a* and b* values) of the food samples during storage at refrigeration conditions (4 °C). L* values decreased during storage in all the samples, indicating that the chicken fillets became darker, change that was more accentuated in unpackaged samples. Regarding the sample redness (a* values), it increased during storage time in unpackaged samples. In contrast, it was significantly lower in packaged chicken breast fillets and there was a trend to decrease during the storage time in those prepared with electrospun fibers containing EOs, suggesting some interaction between the essential oils and the meat pigments, thus affecting redness. The sample yellowness (b* values) increased to a greater extend in unpackaged chicken breast fillets which could be related with the greater lipid oxidation of these samples as it will be detailed bellow. Lipid oxidation values during chilled storage of the chicken breast fillets are gathered in Table 4 for the samples covered with the different electrospun structures. Samples packaged with PVOHc structures inhibited lipid oxidation around 19 %, whereas samples packaged with EOs-loaded electrospun fibers prevented lipid oxidation to a greater extent, reaching a ∼43 and ∼65 % of lipid oxidation inhibition for PVOH films prepared with REO and LEO, respectively. The protective effect observed for PVOHc electrospun coatings can be ascribed to the presence of non-cross-linked (free) CA in the chicken samples, which may contribute to improve food quality and shelf-life (Doležalová, Molatová, Buňka, Březina, & Marounek, 2010; Gonzales-Fandos et al., 2009). Interestingly, this effect was enhanced with the incorporation LEO and REO, indicating that even most of the EOs were degraded during the annealing process, the remaining compounds had antioxidant properties as well as antimicrobial activity, as it will be detailed bellow. Regarding the antimicrobial activity, viable counts of L. monocytogenes after 7 days of incubation at 4 °C on chicken breasts are displayed in Fig. 4 . An increase of about 1 log in the counts of pathogenic bacteria was observed in the chicken breast controls after 7 days of storage. In contrast, samples with PVOHc did not significantly increase the viable counts while a growth inhibition was observed in the chicken breasts packaged with PVOHc/EOs electrospun structures, exhibiting up to 1 log decrease with respect to the initial values and with the PVOH/LEO having slightly more antimicrobial effect than REO. Therefore, in terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial growth, the use of EOs-loaded PVOH films significantly prolonging the shelf life of chicken breast fillets, being LEO more efficient than REO. These differences can be ascribed to the presence of the most active compound, 1,8 cineole, which was present in greater amounts in LEO (∼ 69.87 %) than in REO (∼55.80 %) (Göksen et al., 2020)."
14,Conclusions,"Active cross-linked electrospun PVOH fibers were prepared containing two different EOs. Citric acid (CA) was used as a cross-linker together with an annealing process with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the fibers in contact with high moisture foods. The average diameter of the fibers decreased with the incorporation of both EOs and CA, mainly ascribed to the increase in electrical conductivity. The morphology and porous structure of the electrospun fibers containing EOs and PVOH was successfully maintained to a greater extent in annealed samples after being immersed in water, evidencing the efficiency of the crosslinking process. In contrast, this effect was not observed in the annealed electrospun samples prepared without CA. Furthermore, physicochemical and thermal stability of annealed electrospun PVOH food packaging structures were successfully improved by the incorporation of CA. The materials were tested to improve preservation of chicken breast samples, even though the annealing process probably degraded most of the EOs, as observed through TGA. These active packaging coatings containing LEO and REO enhanced the shelf-life of chicken breast fillets, reducing the lipid oxidation process and reducing Listeria counts during cold storage. Therefore, this works provides a simple method to obtain PVOH-coatings with suitable integrity for use in the active preservation of fresh food products like meat."
