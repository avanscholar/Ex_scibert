0,Introduction,"The dramatic increase in the demand for transport fuels coupled with diminishing crude oil reserves and the increase in environmental concerns have raised the interest in renewable energy. One of the fuel alternatives that is currently being investigated is hydrogen (H2). Unlike fossil fuels, H2 burns cleanly, without emitting any environmental pollutants [1]. In addition, H2 possesses the highest energy content per unit of weight (i.e. 142kJ/g) which is about 2.75 times greater than that of hydrocarbon fuels. H2 is considered to be the energy carrier of the future [2] and could have an important role in reducing environmental emissions. However nearly 96% of the H2 used in fuel cells or as raw material in the petrochemical industry is produced from fossil fuels by methods such as catalytic steam reforming, refinery oil partial oxidation and gasification that release carbon dioxide (CO2) and are not sustainable [3]. Biological H2 (biohydrogen) production is a promising alternative to overcome the use of these petroleum-derived hydrocarbons [4] and has attracted worldwide attention for its potential as an inexhaustible source and low cost. The production of H2 through dark fermentation offers significant advantages over other forms of biohydrogen production because it requires lower investment, simpler operational conditions compared to more sophisticated technologies and is environmentally advantageous especially when it is derived from renewable resources [3,5]. In order to enhance the yield and economy of H2 production by dark fermentation, it is important to explore suitable cheap substrates, which can be utilized by a broad range of H2 producing microorganisms [6]. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to microbial conversion of low-priced industrial and agricultural wastes into bioenergy [6–8]. The use of the unpurified side product of biodiesel production, viz. crude glycerol, could be an ideal source for industrial fermentation. Biodiesel is one of the promising alternatives such as renewable fuels and its production capacity has been well developed in recent years [9]. Although biodiesel represents a secure, renewable and environmentally safe alternative to fossil fuels, its economic viability is a major concern. At the same time, the increased production of biodiesel influenced remarkably the glycerol market due to the generation of a surplus of crude glycerol which is yielded as by-product at about 10% (w/w) of the biodiesel production [10]. The global biodiesel market is estimated to reach 37 billion gallons by 2016 with an average annual growth of 42%, which means about 4 billion gallons of crude glycerol will be produced each year. Biodiesel can be produced using a variety of feedstocks like pure plant oil, waste vegetable oil, waste animal fat and algae oil [11]. Apart from the feedstock (fat or oil), several other chemicals are needed to make biodiesel. Thus at the end of the transesterification reaction the crude glycerol is a mixture of different compounds that contains approximately 50–60% of pure glycerol, 12–16% alkalis, 15–18% methyl esters, 8–12% methanol and 2–3% water. In addition, elements such as Ca, Mg, P, or S can be present [12] and which might be useful for the microorganisms. The glycerol produced in the transesterification is not pure and thus of low value. However, the composition in organic matter and basic elements is one of the reasons why glycerol has been identified as a promising carbon source for industrial microbiology in the future [13]. Besides, it can improve the economic viability of the biodiesel industry. In addition to availability, low prices and potential to mitigate possible environmental hazards and reducing greenhouse gas emission [14] another advantage of using crude glycerol in dark fermentations is the highly reduced redox state of carbon in glycerol compared to common sugars like glucose and xylose. This enables it to have a higher yield of reduced products such as H2 [15]. Until recently, the fermentative metabolism of glycerol has been reported in species of the genera Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and Anaerobiospirillum among others [6,8,16–19]. In addition, various mixed microflora and co-cultures have also been examined for their ability to produce H2 from glycerol [6,20]. In this paper, first we evaluated different strains viz. E. coli CECT432, E. coli CECT434 and E. cloacae MCM2/1, for their capacity to ferment pure glycerol to H2 and other useable side products. Secondly, the strain that produced higher H2 (E. coli CECT432) was mixed (ratio 1:1) with a previously isolated strain of Enterobacter spH1 [6] to study the effect of co-culturing on the H2 production using pure and crude glycerol. The kinetics of the H2 production, the fermentation end products and the carbon balance were determined. In addition, the composition of the crude glycerol was thoroughly investigated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Fermentable substrates,"2.1 Fermentable substrates Pure glycerol (purity ⩾99%), glucose (d-glucose, anhydrous) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Madrid, Spain. Crude glycerol was obtained from a local biodiesel production plant (Stocks del Vallés BDP S.A., Barcelona, Spain) that utilizes waste vegetable oil (WVO) and waste animal fats (WAF) as the raw material for biodiesel production via the alkali mediated transesterification process."
3,Microorganisms and culture conditions,"2.2 Microorganisms and culture conditions Escherichia coli CECT432 and E. coli CECT434 were obtained from the Spanish culture collection (CECT, Valencia). Enterobacter cloacae MCM2/1 was previously isolated in our laboratory from a gasoline contaminated soil [21], and Enterobacter spH1 was previously isolated from Sant Carles de la Ràpita, Spain [6]. The latter strain (Enterobacter spH1), which showed highest H2 production among other strains, was used for mixed cultures with E. coli CECT432. The first three stains were tested for their ability to produce H2 from pure glycerol and the mixed culture was tested on both pure and crude glycerol. The growth medium, nutrient broth (NB), consisted of 5.0g/L peptic digests of animal tissue, 5.0g/L sodium chloride, 1.5g/L beef extract and 1.5g/L yeast extract [6]. The fermentation medium (MYG) was prepared with 10g/L malt extract, 5g/L yeast extract, 10g/L sodium chloride and 20.2g/L pure glycerol or 5.1% (v/v) crude glycerol. The pH of the media was adjusted to 6.7 before sterilization at 121°C for 20min. Both media were selected because of their suitability for H2 production [6]. The strains were aerobically precultured overnight in NB in serum bottles at 37°C in an incubator-shaker at 200rpm. The cells were harvested at the end of the exponential phase from the NB medium and this grown cells where inoculated to the MYG medium in a jacketed bioreactor with different volume %. For the mono culture experiments 10% (v/v) inoculum of one strain was used and for the co-culture equal 5% (v/v) of each strain was used. All experiments of MYG medium were done at pH=6.34 and under anaerobic conditions. All fermentations were performed in a batch system. A 1.2L jacketed bioreactor was used with a working volume of 500mL and operated at 37°C and continuous stirring at 200rpm. A total of 450mL of MYG medium, containing different concentrations of substrate, was added to the bioreactor and autoclaved (for 15min at 121°C). An anoxic atmosphere was created by continuous purging with 30mL/min of argon gas (99.99%). The reactor was on-line connected to a GC to directly analyze the gases generated. The liquid fermentation products were analyzed by GC/MS and HPLC. Unless stated otherwise, the duration of the batch fermentation was 72h. Each experimental condition was studied in duplicate or triplicate."
4,Analytical procedures,"2.3 Analytical procedures Headspace analysis. The composition of the gas phase of the co-culture experiments was measured every 30min throughout the fermentation using a GC-14B gas chromatograph (Shimazdu, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 80/100 Porapak-Q column. The operational temperatures of the GC for the injection port, oven and detector were 150°C, 80°C and 200°C, respectively. Argon and helium were used as the carrier gas at a flow of 30mL/min for measuring H2 and CO2 respectively. The H2 from the fermentation was quantified by comparison with pure gas standards. For each batch, the gas samples were analyzed continuously by online GC connected to the bioreactor. The chromatogram was developed and analyzed using the Turbochrome Navigator (version 4.1) software from the Perkin Elmer Corporation. Liquid analysis. The concentration of glycerol and fermentation products such as organic acids (formate, lactate, acetate, propionate, butyrate), alcohols (butanol, ethanol and methanol), diols (1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 2,3-butanediol) and alcohol sugars, were determined and quantified by HPLC (Agilent 1100 Series) furnished with HP Chemstation software (Agilent, Waldbron, Germany) for data acquisition. The column was a Transgenomic ICSepICE COREGEL-87H3. The method used has been previously published by Garcia-Llobodanin et al. [22]. Prior to the analysis the liquid samples were centrifuged at 9800rpm for 15min and filtered through a 0.2μm disposable filter. The injection volume of the sample was 20μl. 2.3.1 Biomass analysis Biomass was estimated by protein measurements using a modified Lowry method [23], involving a treatment with NaOH and SDS, which completely lysed all cells. The dry cell biomass was calculated taking into account that protein comprises about 60% of the cell content [24]. The carbon fraction of biomass dry cell weight content was estimated to be 54% with an average chemical composition of CH1.74O0.33N0.23 [25,26]. 2.3.2 Analytical procedures for biodiesel waste (crude glycerol) The glycerol content of crude glycerol was determined by HPLC after appropriate dilution and filtration, as described above. The water content was measured following the standard method (ISO 2097-1972) by using the volumetric Karl Fisher titration. Ash content was analyzed according to the standard method (ISO 2098-1972) by burning 1g crude glycerol in a muffle furnace at 750°C for 3h. The MONG (non-glycerol organic matter) levels were calculated according to the following equation: (100−(% glycerol content+% water content+% ash content)) [27,28]. The composition of other compounds present in the biodiesel waste (mainly MONG), were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The equipment used was a GC/MS (6890N, Agilent of GC/Pegosees III, Lego of MS) equipped with a capillary column HP-FFAP (Agilent 19091F-433, 0.25mm×30m×0.25um). The column temperature was initially kept at 35°C for 4min, then raised at 10°C/min to 150°C, kept at 150°C for 10min, then raised to 250°C at 15°C/min and maintained at this temperature for 10min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were set at 245 and 250°C, respectively. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (Analytik jena, Multi N/C 2100). Pure glycerol was used as a reference. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis of ash was used to identify the salts. The XRD analysis of the ash was recorded using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Bragg-Bentano for focusing geometry and vertical θ-θ goniometer) with an angular 2θ diffraction range between 3° and 90°. The samples were dispersed on a Si (510) sample holder. The data were collected with an angular step of 0.03° at 5s per step and sample rotation. Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54056Å) was obtained from a copper X-ray tube operated at 40kV and 30mA. The crystalline phases were identified using the JCPDS files. The elemental composition of the ash was determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with a JEOL JSM-35C scanning microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 15kV. A small portion of each sample powder was coated on a metallic disk holder and covered with a thin carbon layer before SEM analysis. Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 28 instrument with a resolution of 4cm−1. It was used to analyze the characteristics of the pure glycerol and the crude glycerol in the biodiesel waste. 2.3.3 Data analysis and kinetic parameters We modeled the fermentation data using the Gompertz equation according to the formula described in Maru et al. [29] for the estimation of the cumulative hydrogen production (Pi(t)), the consumption of glycerol (So-S(t)) and the yield of the fermentation end-products (YPmax,i). Moreover, the maximum specific production or consumption (qmax,i) was calculated using the ratio of the maximum production rate or maximum production rate to maximum dry cell weight (DCWmax). (1) q max, i = R max, i DCW max or q max, i = S max, i DCW max where q max, i is the specific production or consumption rate i (mmol/Lh), R max ,i – the maximum production rate i, Smax – maximum substrate consumption rate (mmol/Lh) and DCWmax – maximum dry cell weight (g/L). Carbon balances (C-balance) and degree of reduction balances (ε-balance) were calculated according to Oh et al. [25] and Converti and Perego [26] using the standard elemental biomass composition (molecular formula for the mixed culture) CH1.74O0.33N0.23 [24–26]. This corresponds to the biomass carbon content of 53.6% and with a degree of reduction of 4.32 electrons per C atom. Glycerol uptake efficiency. The efficiency of glycerol uptake (E) by the strains was calculated using the equation described in Maru et al. [6]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characteristics of the crude glycerol,"3.1 Characteristics of the crude glycerol The crude glycerol obtained from the WVO and WAF was a dark brown liquid with a neutral pH of around 6.8. The chemical characterization of the crude glycerol used in this work is presented in Table 1 . The glycerol content was around 47.5% (w/w), which was lower than what was reported by others with values between 65% and 85% (w/w) [30,31] and similar to the composition of crude glycerol described by Saenge et al. [32]. However its composition differed from the components content reported by Manosak et al. [33]. The differences in composition of crude glycerol can be attributed to different feedstocks and different glycerol purification methods used by the biodiesel producers. GC/MS. The composition of crude glycerol derived from the WVO and WAF methyl ester plant was also analyzed by GC/MS. The list of the compounds that were detected and their abundance using this technique is shown in Table 2 (and Supplementary Fig. 1). Besides glycerol, the crude glycerol contains various compounds, including fatty acids and other derivatives described in this table. The compounds determined by GC/MS are diverse, which could be related to the type of feed stock (WVO and WAF), as observed by Hu et al. [34]. FTIR. Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectrum (400–4000cm−1) of crude glycerol in comparison with the spectrum of pure glycerol. The FTIR analysis shows the presence of functional groups of COO, OH, CO, CH [35]. The entire functional group spectrum of the crude glycerol was almost similar to that of pure glycerol but with a broader absorption band at 3300cm−1 and two well-defined bands at 1644 and 1216cm−1. The glycerol moiety of the pure compound is evidenced by the absorption band at 1500–1200cm−1 assigned to overlapping of the CH in-planes and OH bending in the glycerol molecule. The presence of the OH group in both samples (pure glycerol and crude glycerol) was evidenced by the fundamental mode of OH stretching at 3600–3000cm−1 [36]. The broader band at 3300cm−1 was probably due to the OH groups from water and in addition to the OH from the glycerol molecules as the crude glycerol still contained about 40% (w/w) water [37]. The CH stretching band was seen at around at 2862.6–2929.6cm−1, while the bands for CH scissoring and bending appeared at the region of 1410–1450cm−1. The bands around 1000–1300cm−1 were contributed by the CO group stretching in the sample. The 2970, 1235, and 1220cm−1 bands fit in the ranges that indicate OH bonds. COH bending was found at 1403.5–1486cm−1, CO stretching at 1454.5cm−1 and 1113.6cm−1 represented the primary alcohol and secondary alcohol. The presence of some impurities (MONG 7.2% w/w) was shown by the absorption band at 1644cm−1 (CO group) which was similar to the research findings of Yong et al. [36]. Yong et al. [36] observed a band around 1649cm−1 and suggested that this peak corresponded to the oxidation products of glycerol such as glyceraldehydes, dihydroxyacetone and free fatty acids. The other band around 1216cm−1 could be CO stretches (strong absorptions; asymmetrical coupled vibrations) of saturated aliphatic esters from the MONG [38]. XRD. The XRD analysis showed (Supplementary Fig. 2) that the crude glycerol contains a large amount of salt crystals of K2SO4 and lower amounts of Na2Mg(SO4)(H2O)4. These salts are a result of the KOH, used as a catalyst in the transesterification, and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) used for neutralization or/and esterification processes [12]. SEM. The Elemental analysis using SEM for the biodiesel ash (5.6% (w/w) is shown in Supplementary Table 1. As can be referred in this table the crude glycerol has a very large amount of potassium and phosphorus. Thompson and He [12] also investigated the elemental composition of crude glycerol from different feedstocks (such as mustard seeds, canola, soybean, and waste vegetable oil). They reported the presence of calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, sulphur. Schröder and Südekum [39] have also reported the following elemental composition of crude glycerol from rapeseed oil feedstock: phosphorous, potassium and sodium. Cadmium, mercury, and arsenic were all below detectable limits. TOC. The total organic carbon composition (%) of the crude glycerol revealed that 66.5±4% TOC was due to glycerol and 33.5±4% was due to MONG and others."
7,Comparative biohydrogen production by E. coli and Enterobacter strains using pure glycerol,"3.2 Comparative biohydrogen production by E. coli and Enterobacter strains using pure glycerol Fig. 2 shows the comparison of H2 production, biomass growth and ability of glycerol conversion by E. coli CECT432, E. coli CECT434 and E. cloacae MCM2/1 using pure glycerol (20g/L or 0.22M) as substrate. It can be seen that over a period of 72h E. coli CECT432 shows the highest H2 production (0.96mmol/Lh or 21.2mL H2/Lh). The increase in H2 production correlates with an increase in dry cell mass. The specific H2 productivity was 38.6, 58.0, 31.1mL/gDCWh for E. coli CECT 432, E. coli CECT434 and E. cloacae MCM2/1, respectively. However, it is important to note that there is also growth and H2 production for all the three strains in the control (without glycerol). This is mainly due to the yeast and malt extract. It is reported by Ito et al. [40] that addition of both yeast extract (5g/L) and tryptone (5g/L) to synthetic medium, effectively increased the rate of H2 and ethanol production and glycerol consumption. They suggested that some nutrients, such as specific amino acids and vitamins stimulate the growth of Enterobacter sp. The H2 yield (mol H2/mol glycerol consumed) was 0.61, 0.47 and 0.37 for E. coli CECT 432, E. coli CECT434 and E. cloacae MCM2/1, respectively. These yields are lower compared to a previous study with newly isolated Enterobacter and Citrobacter sp. [6] and similar to studies done by other researchers [15,40]. E. coli ferments glycerol anaerobically [15,41], but its specific growth rate on glycerol is very low [16]. Moreover, as indicated in Fig. 2 the maximum dry cell mass growth was also low. Nonetheless, E. coli is very attractive for glycerol utilization because it is one of the most commonly used host organisms for industrial applications. Besides, it is easy to manipulate genetically, and can produce a wide variety of anaerobic fermentation products [16]. The other parameter used for the comparison was the glycerol uptake efficiency. The glycerol uptake efficiency for E. coli CECT432 (57%) was higher than that of E. coli CECT434 (42%) and E. cloacae MCM2/1 (45%). However, these data are significantly lower than those reported earlier [6]."
8,Optimization of H2 production using a mixed culture (1:1) of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432,"3.3 Optimization of H2 production using a mixed culture (1:1) of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 The aim of this study was to investigate whether a co-culture (Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432) would give higher amounts of H2 using pure glycerol and crude glycerol. In our previous study Enterobacter spH1 [6] produced 167.4mM of H2 under the same conditions. Kotay and Das [42] had reported a 10% increment using a consortium consisting of E. cloacae IIT-BT 08, C. freundii IIT-BT L139 and Bacillus coagulans IIT-BT S1 with glucose as a substrate. Enterobacter and E. coli are closely related belonging both to the family of Enterobacteriaceae and have shown their potential of producing high H2 yields. These bacteria are metabolically versatile, and utilize a wide range of carbon sources. Of all the fermentative hydrogen producers, Enterobacter sp. have attracted much attention due to their high growth rate, ease of culture similar to E. coli, and wide substrate range [43]. Fig. 3 gives an overview of the metabolic pathway involved in glycerol fermentation by E. coli CECT432 (data about the metabolic products detected by HPLC/GC are not shown but included in the figure) and Enterobacter spH1 [6] based on the identified metabolites. The dashed boxes show that E. coli CECT432 and Enterobacter spH1 use similar reductive pathways to 1,2-propanediol and ethanol. It was reported by Hu and Wood [16], that a chemically mutated strains of E. coli can produce more ethanol and synthetize 1,2-propanediol in the presence of tryptone. In our previous study [6] Enterobacter spH1 produced high amount of ethanol and a very small amount of 1,2-propanediol. The mixed culture of these two strains has improved the production of H2 and other usable end products. Interestingly, the co-culture (1:1) of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 resulted in a higher H2 production of 212.8mM (Fig. 2) from pure glycerol. Moreover, the amount of H2 produced per mol of glycerol converted, increased from 0.61 to 1.26molH2/molglycerol. This data indicate that the mixed co-culture has the ability to co-exist, but also that the overall fermentation is affected by the co-culture, leading to a higher H2 yield. Therefore, energy and carbon balances, kinetic parameters over the H2 production and the usable products were studied in more detail using pure glycerol and crude glycerol. 3.3.1 Fermentation of pure glycerol and crude glycerol Fig. 4 (a–d) shows the time course of a batch fermentation by the mixed culture (1:1) of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 using pure glycerol and crude glycerol. Our results clearly show that the mixed culture is perfectly able to grow on pure glycerol and crude glycerol as source of carbon and energy. The type of carbon source and the initial substrate concentration usually play an important role in the bacterial growth and product yield [44]. It has been discussed by Choi et al. [45] that one of the primary issues when using crude glycerol for bioconversions is to acquire a microbial host which is able to tolerate batch-to-batch variations and the impurities found in this co-product [45]. These inconsistencies are largely due to differences in the quality of the initial oil feedstock used and the presence of contaminants as seen in Supplementary Table 1 [13]. Finding organisms that produce H2 and that can tolerate the impurities found in the crude glycerol is the main challenge [45]. Here, we show that the mixed culture of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 has the ability to produce H2 without any complex pre-treatment of the crude glycerol. This utilization by the mixed culture is attractive in reducing the cost and scaling up of the process. In Fig. 4(a–d), it is showed that pure glycerol and crude glycerol were mainly fermented to ethanol, lactate, 2,3-butanediol, acetate, CO2, H2, succinate and minor amounts of 1,2-propanediol (data not shown in these figures). However, 1,3-propanediol and formate were not detected. These end products are commonly found in mesophilic glycerol fermentation by Enterobacteria [46]. The only difference we observed using the two carbon sources was a small amount of propionate in the crude glycerol culture. On both pure glycerol and crude glycerol the highest soluble metabolite concentration was found for ethanol with an amount of 170 and 222mM, respectively. This suggests that the mixed culture of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 is a good producer of ethanol. Ito et al. [40] have also proposed the production of hydrogen gas and ethanol from glycerol-containing wastes of a biodiesel manufacturing process using Enterobacter aerogenes HU-101. Alternatively, according to Dharmadi et al. [46], the anaerobic fermentation of glycerol by E. coli can also generate ethanol, lactate, succinate, and hydrogen. Fig. 4(a) also shows that total H2 production from pure glycerol was lower than crude glycerol. This could be due to the higher succinate formation (23.6mM) using the pure glycerol than the crude glycerol (3.5mM). Substrate consumption and product formation for the mixed culture (1:1) of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 have been fitted (solid lines in Fig. 4(a–d)) using modified Gompertz equations [29]. These figures show the typical curves of product formation and substrate consumption. Table 3 (a and b) show the kinetic parameters determined from the Gompertz modeling and the maximum molar yields (YPmax,i), maximum specific production or consumption (qmax,i) and maximum glycerol conversion (%). It can be seen that the regression coefficients (R2) indicate a strong correlation between the experimental data and the model, except for acetic acid. The maximum rates of H2 production (Rmax,H2) (Table 3(a and b)) were 8.5 and 15.8mmol/Lh and the corresponding yields (YH2) were 1.01 and 1.53molH2/molglycerol consumed for pure glycerol and crude glycerol respectively. The Rmax,EtOH were 4.0 and 10.5mmol/Lh with a corresponding (YEtOH) of 0.88 and 1.21molethanol/molglycerol consumed for pure glycerol and crude glycerol respectively. The higher yield above the theoretical values of ethanol and H2 for the crude glycerol suggested the contribution of the unknown carbon sources or electron sources present in the crude glycerol. The maximum production rate of H2 was less than the value of Ito et al. [40] (30mmol/Lh). This difference could be due to the type of medium used (synthetic and MYG). The same authors have reported that addition of a porous ceramics material support to fix cells in the reactor, increased the H2 production rate to 63mmol/Lh with a corresponding ethanol yield of 0.85mol/mol-glycerol. The ethanol yield of 1.21mol/mol-crude glycerol obtained in our work is much higher. It has been also reported by Ito et al. [40] that the yield of H2 and ethanol decreases with an increase in the concentrations of biodiesel waste and commercially available glycerol. Moreover, they pointed out that due to a high salt content in biodiesel waste, the rates of H2 and ethanol production were much lower than those found at the same concentration of pure glycerol. However, in this study the 5% (w/w) crude glycerol, which contains 279mM of glycerol, did not inhibit the growth and H2 production. Rather it was shown that the H2 cumulative production of 281mmol/L on crude glycerol is higher than that on pure glycerol, which contains only 220mM of glycerol (Fig. 4(a and c)). Also, in this study, the XRD and SEM analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1) show that the salt we have in the ash is mostly K2SO4 and Na2 Mg(SO4)2(H2O)4. Therefore, the total K2SO4 in this study is about 2.5g/L which is much less than the 7g/L K2HPO4 and 5.5g/L KH2PO4 present in the synthetic medium used in Ito et al.’s [40] study. Henceforth the total amount of salt present in this study due to NaCl in the MYG medium and the crude glycerol, is not likely to inhibit the H2 production."
9,Carbon balance and carbon distribution for crude glycerol and pure glycerol,"3.4 Carbon balance and carbon distribution for crude glycerol and pure glycerol It is important in any microbial fermentation process that the mass balances of substrates and end products are satisfied; otherwise, some important microbial metabolite might be overlooked. Table 4 presents the balances of carbon (C-balance) and degree of reduction (ε-balance), using pure glycerol and crude glycerol as substrates. These were carried out using the experimental final concentrations of products (hydrogen, ethanol, lactate, acetate, succinate, 2,3-butanediol, 1,2-propanediol, carbon dioxide and biomass). The C-balance calculation was based on the input-output determined by analyses of all the measurable metabolites and the TOC analysis. The degree of reduction balance values was also calculated. The increment in the biomass growth was included in the C-balance and ε-balance as well as the initial carbon contained in the yeast and malt extract (TOC measurements) used in the MYG medium. The validity of the present approach was confirmed by checking the carbon material balance and degree of reduction balance (Table 4), for which carbon and the degree of reduction recoveries for pure glycerol and crude glycerol were around 97.0%, 103.9% and 102.7%, 104.3%, respectively. The carbon recovery for crude glycerol was slightly >100% indicating that there might be some carbon sources other than glycerol that might be involved in the fermentation, whereas the carbon recovery of 97% for the pure glycerol was similar to the values reported earlier [25,26]. The minimal deviation of C-balance from 100% also indicates that end product has been consistently analyzed by HPLC and TOC. Table 4 also indicates the carbon distributions of the pure glycerol to the metabolites."
10,Conclusions,"Diluted crude glycerol from biodiesel can be used as substrate for anaerobic fermentation by Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432. Their mixed culture has an increased effect on fermentation of pure and crude glycerol to hydrogen yield and biomass. The glycerol conversion by the mixed culture shows a mixed-acid type of fermentation, with hydrogen, ethanol, lactate, acetate, succinate, 2,3-butanediol, and CO2 as main end products. The H2 yield (YH2) and ethanol yield (YEtOH) obtained from crude glycerol by the mixed culture are the highest obtained using mesophilic strains reported to date. Considering the kinetics of the study the best fitting was obtained using the modified Gompertz equation for both the product formation such as gaseous product (R2 >0.9976) and liquid products (R2 >0.9775, except for acetic acid, R2 >0.8575) and substrate consumption (R2 >0.9875). The optimization with higher amount of crude glycerol (>5% v/v) has to be studied for the dark fermentation in the future, since it will reduce the cost due to the dilution process used in the medium."
