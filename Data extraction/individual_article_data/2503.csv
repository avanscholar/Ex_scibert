0,Introduction,"Over the past two decades a large quantity of research has focused on microbial production of hydrogen (H2) from hexose and pentose sugars using mixed anaerobic cultures. A major driver for forging ahead this work is the depletion of fossil fuels coupled with increasing climate change. Among the various biofuels research projects under development, hydrogen (H2) is emerging as a contender because it is a clean burning fuel and if it is derived via microbial fermentation there is no net emission of greenhouse gases. Using mixed anaerobic microbial cultures to produce H2 depends on the flow of chemical species between the various trophic groups such that the net free energy is negative [1]. Dark fermentation of sugars by mixed cultures consists of acidogenesis (conversion of sugars to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and H2), acetogenesis (acetate production from VFAs) and methanogenesis (using acetate or H2/CO2 to produce methane (CH4)) [2]. Inhibiting the H2 consuming populations allows for H2 production instead of methane and acetate. If acetate is the only reduced carbon by-product from glucose fermentation, the H2 yield is 4 mol mol−1 glucose (Table 1 , Equation (1)) while only 2 mol of H2 is produced if butyrate is the only reduced carbon end product (Equation (2)). Between pH 5 to 6, acetate and butyrate are produced in addition to other liquid by-products such as lactate, propionate and short chain alcohols (Equations (3)–(5)) during glucose fermentation by mixed anaerobic cultures. Major H2 sinks leading to low H2 yields include the production of lactate (Equation (4)) as well as alcohols (Equation (5)). Low yields are also caused by H2 consumers such as homoacetogens (Equation (6)), hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Equation (7)) and sulfidogens (Equation (8)). Improving the H2 yield, by inhibiting H2-consuming microorganisms and directing electron equivalents to H2 is an objective in dark H2 fermentation research using mixed anaerobic cultures. Enhancing the H2 yield in mixed anaerobic cultures can be accomplished using chemicals such as bromoethanosulfonic acid (BESA), chloroform, acetylene and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) [3–7]. In addition, heat treatment is another method used to inhibit or suppress the growth of H2 consumers in mixed anaerobic microbial cultures [8]. Although heat treatment of mixed anaerobic cultures has been extensively studied as a method to increase H2 production; however, no study has been able to translate laboratory scale studies into data for full-scale studies. This data includes engineering design, capital cost and operating and maintenance cost for a full-scale system. Major unknown costs associated with failure of a full-scale facility include disposing, reseeding and heating the culture to over 100 °C. Failure of a reactor operating using heat treated cultures can be attributed to improper operational conditions or from using none sterile feedstocks which are contaminated with aerobic, anaerobic and facultative microorganisms. Anaerobic and facultative microorganisms could proliferate in a bioreactor and cause failure. Using a chemical stressing agent such as LCFA to selectively suppress the growth of H2-consuming microorganism is a practical alternative to heat treatment. If a reactor containing LCFA treated cultures fails, the significant costs will include disposing, reseeding and adding an LCFA. LCFAs are microbial inhibitors which have been used to control the growth of selected microorganisms in H2 producing cultures [4–7]. LCFAs and glycerol are the only by-products produced from the hydrolysis of vegetable oils. Vegetable oils are renewable biodegradable organic chemicals which can be isolated from fried food effluents or produced from the processing of oil seeds or algae. Aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens are inhibited by LCFAs [9,10]. Several studies have provided evidence showing polyunsaturated LCFAs (linoleic acid (LA; C18:2) and oleic acid (OA; C18:2)) can uncouple syntrophic methane production [11–13] and re-direct the flow of electron equivalents to proton reduction [4–7]. Hydrogen yields reaching 3.1 mol H2 mol−1 glucose have been reported in glucose fermenting mixed cultures inhibited with LA [7]. LCFAs, by-products from LA degradation, such as palmitic (PA, C16:0), myristic (MA, C14:0), and lauric (LUA, C12:0) are inhibitory to many anaerobic microorganisms. LUA can impair the growth of Gram-positive bacteria although it is less active than polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids [14,15]. The inhibition of aceticlastic methanogens by LUA was reported at levels reaching 1.6 mM (320 mg L−1), whereas 4.3 mM (860 mg L−1) was reported to decrease aceticlastic activity by 50% [11]. LCFA mixtures containing MA and LUA have been reported to suppress methanogenic activity to a greater extent when compared to cultures fed each fatty acid. According to Soliva et al. [16], the methanogenic activity in a mixed culture fed an MA:LUA mixture (2:1) decreased by 96% when compared to cultures fed only LUA. The ability of long to medium chain LCFAs to direct the flow of electrons towards H2 production instead of methane during glucose fermentation is unknown and additional work is required to demonstrate their effects on uncoupling syntrophic interactions. Many studies have shown that LA can retain its inhibitory characteristics on a variety of anaerobic microbial populations [4,6,7]. However, the impact of LA degradation by-products (PA, MA and LUA) on H2 producing and H2 consuming microbial populations have not been reported. LCFAs are slowly degrading chemicals and they are expected to be present in a mixture comprising a series of by-products in batch or continuous flow reactors. Hence, the objective of this study is to examine the effects of PA, MA, LUA, and a mixture PA:MA (50:50) on H2 production from glucose in batch reactors using anaerobic mixed cultures at 37 °C with an initial pH set at 5.0."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula source,"2.1 Inocula source The anaerobic granular culture utilized in this study was obtained from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating effluent discharged from an ethanol manufacturing facility (Chatham, ON)."
3,Experimental design and hydrogen production studies,"2.2 Experimental design and hydrogen production studies Experiments were designed to examine the effects of LUA, MA, PA (TCI, OR, USA (99% purity)) and a mixture PA:MA (50:50 on a molar basis) on H2 production from glucose (Table 2 ). All experiments were performed simultaneously using the same granular microbial culture. LCFAs control experiments were designed using LUA, MA, PA and MA:PA to examine their impact on the inoculum over an 8 day experimental period. The objective of experiments conducted with glucose plus LCFAs (individual LCFA plus an LCFA mixture) was to determine the effects of LCFAs on H2 production and the diversion of electron equivalents away from methanogens and other H2 consuming microorganisms. All experiments were conducted in triplicates using 160 mL serum bottle batch reactors incubated at (37 ± 2 °C) and mixed using a shaker (Lab Line Instruments Model 3520) set at 200 rpm. The initial pH was set at 5.0 and the volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration was 2000 mg L−1 [7]. Triplicate glucose control batch reactors were prepared to assess the performance of anaerobic mixed cultures without any LCFAs. For experiments conducted with LCFAs (LUA, MA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA) controls and glucose plus LCFAs (LUA, MA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA), two sets of batch reactors (2 × 12) were prepared and injected with LCFA (7.131 mM) one day before day 0 (glucose injection). LCFA stock solutions (100,000 mg L−1) were prepared in accordance with the procedure described by Saady et al. [7]. Glucose (ACP Chemicals, Montreal, Quebec) from a stock solution (100,000 mg L−1) was injected on day 0 and again on day 4 in the glucose controls and cultures fed glucose plus LCFAs. The initial concentrations of glucose and LCFA fed to the cultures are shown in Table 2. Four days after the first glucose injection, all the batch reactors were opened, the pH was re adjusted to the initial value (pH 5.0), purged with N2 (Praxair Windsor, ON (99.99% purity)) for 3 min and re-sealed again with Teflon® lined septas and capped with aluminium crimp caps."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis Headspace gases, VFAs, and alcohols were monitored daily for 4 days after each glucose injection. Glucose degradation was monitored for 24 h in the glucose controls and the glucose plus LCFA fed cultures. Four days after the second glucose injection (day 8), the volatile suspended solids (VSS) and total suspended solids (TSS) for all the experimental conditions were measured in accordance to Standard Methods [17]. All the analytical methods are the same as those described previously by Chowdhury et al. [4]. All the liquid and gas analytical data are reported as the mean of triplicate samples."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis A principal component analysis (PCA) identifies trends in a data set by finding trend lines which directions maximize the variances of the data points [18]. The PCA reduces the redundancy and show patterns in a data set. The number of PCs is less than or equal to the number of original variables. The original data set undergoes a linear transformation such that the relative location of the data points remains the same. In the transformed data set, each measured variable corresponds to one of the axes representing the projections of the points. The principal components correspond to the axes of a new coordinate system [19]. The axis corresponding to the direction of the first principal component is represented by a line required to minimize the sum of squared perpendicular distances from it to each point in the data set. The axis corresponding to the direction of the first principal component (PC) is associated with data showing the best trend with the data points. The first PC accounts for a majority of the variance in the model. The direction of the second PC (and other principal components) also minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular distances of the data set points. The second PC is linearly independent from the direction representing the first PC and other PCs. The second PC accounts for the second largest variance not already accounted for by the first PC. The same applies to the third, fourth, fifth etc. PCs in the model. Each PC accounts for an independent trend in the data set and hence, they are not correlated [19]. A plot of two PCs display observations showing grouping, trends, outliers and similarities among different samples. A PCA was performed using Statistica 9 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) to identify the main sources of variation between the two cultures before and after treatment with individual LCFAs (LUA, MA and PA) and the LCFA mixture (MA:PA). The quantity of H2, CH4, VFAs and alcohols from glucose degradation were used as input for the PCA. In addition, data from terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) for the different experimental conditions was subjected to the PCA. The Tukey's paired comparison procedure was used to determine statistical differences between multiple means at the 95% confidence level [20]."
6,Flux balance analysis,"2.5 Flux balance analysis A flux balance analysis (FBA) was applied using data from experiments 1 to 5 for the glucose controls and for cultures fed glucose plus LCFA (Table 2). The metabolic reactions network and the stoichiometries were adapted from the model reported by Chaganti et al. [21] (See Appendix A and B). The FBA was conducted using the MetaFluxNet software, Version 1.8.6.2. The inputs included the external substrate (glucose) and the measured by-products (gases, VFAs, and alcohols). Acetate or acetone production was selected as the objective functions."
7,Genomic techniques,"2.6 Genomic techniques Microbial diversity of the anaerobic communities in the glucose controls, those treated with only LCFA and glucose plus LCFAs was determined by nested PCR of the 16S rRNA gene using the T-RFLP method. Details of the T-RFLP method were described previously by Chaganti et al. [22]. Hae III T-RFLP profiles and the raw data sets were comprised of the peaks reflecting the size in base pairs (bp) of terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) and the area of each peak measured in fluorescence units. The relative abundance of each band detected was determined by calculating the area of each peak as a percentage of the total area. The relative abundance of each bacterial specie which was estimated by the mean richness determined from 16S rRNA T-RFLP Hae III profiles was plotted as a percent (relative abundance) versus the fragment size in (bp)."
8,Results,
9,Hydrogen and methane production,"3.1 Hydrogen and methane production The measured cumulative amount of H2 produced in batch reactors is equal to the gross amount of H2 produced minus the gross amount of H2 consumed. The quantity of H2 produced and the quantity of H2 consumed are due to the H2 producers and H2 consumers, respectively. Under conditions when the gross amount of H2 produced equal the gross amount of H2 consumed, the quantity measured is zero. Hydrogen was detected in the glucose controls and cultures fed LCFA plus glucose. After the first glucose injection, the controls, LUA, MA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA treated cultures produced maximum H2 yields of 2.00 ± 0.32 0.79 ± 0.10, 0.97 ± 0.28, 2.53 ± 0.18, and 1.17 ± 0.57 mol H2 mol−1 glucose, respectively (Table 3 ). After the second glucose injection, the maximum H2 yield reached 2.24 ± 0.15, 1.10 ± 0.15, 0.58 ± 0.14, 1.99 ± 0.18, and 1.04 ± 0.34 mol H2 mol−1 glucose in the controls, LUA, MA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA treated samples, respectively. A maximum yield of 2.53 ± 0.18 mol H2 mol−1 glucose was recorded in cultures fed PA after the first glucose injection on day 3. In comparison to other cultures, the PA treated samples did not show a H2 production lag phase after the first or the second glucose injections. Note after the first glucose injection, a 24 h lag phase was observed in the controls, LUA, MA, and MA:PA treated cultures after the first glucose injection. Hydrogen consumption was observed in the controls, LUA, PA, and MA:PA treated cultures after the first and second glucose injection. The control cultures utilized a net amount of 0.36 ± 0.18 mol H2 mol−1 glucose and 0.70 ± 0.25 mol H2 mol−1 glucose (measured on days 3 and 7) within 24 h. While in the LUA treated cultures, net consumptions of 0.11 ± 0.08 mol H2 mol−1 glucose and 0.05 ± 0.02 mol H2 mol−1 glucose consumed were observed after the first and second glucose injections, respectively. A significant degree of H2 consumption was detected in the PA treated cultures on day 4 (1 day after reaching the maximum yield). On day 4, a net quantity of 0.70 ± 0.28 mol H2 mol−1 glucose was consumed in the PA treated cultures, whereas on day 8, the net H2 consumption decreased to 0.26 ± 0.04 H2 mol−1 glucose. After reaching a maximum H2 yield (on day 3), a net consumption of 0.47 ± 0.16 mol H2 mol−1 glucose was detected within 24 h in cultures treated with a 50:50 PA:MA mixture after the first glucose injection. The maximum methane (CH4) levels produced by the control cultures were 630 ± 125 μmol per bottle and 60 ± 20 μmol per bottle on day 4 and 8, respectively. In the PA treated culture, the maximum CH4 produced (60 ± 33 umol per bottle) was detected on day 2. Methane production was completely inhibited in the LUA treated culture after the first glucose injection (data not shown). Overall, the CH4 production decreased to less than 3 ± 1 umol per bottle in all the LCFAs treated cultures after the second glucose injection (days 5–8)."
10,Glucose degradation,"3.2 Glucose degradation Glucose degradation was affected by the presence of various LCFAs (LUA, MA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA). Relative to the glucose controls, the initial glucose degradation rate decreased in cultures fed with LCFAs. The degradation rate (ug glucose mg−1 VSS min−1) for the controls and cultures fed PA, MA, MA:PA and LUA were as follows: 5.57 ± 0.48, 2.46 ± 0.34, 1.88 ± 0.41, 1.78 ± 0.32 and 0.67 ± 0.15, respectively. Although, the initial glucose degradation rates in the LCFA treated cultures were significantly different (p < 0.05) and less than that of the control culture, the rates were statistically similar for cultures fed PA, MA, and MA:PA (Data not shown). The initial glucose degradation rate was significantly reduced in the presence of LUA when compared to cultures treated with the other LCFAs, while in the PA treated culture it was the least affected. Approximately 57%, 63%, 67% and 87% of the added glucose was consumed within 24 h in the LUA, MA:PA, MA and PA treated samples, respectively, while up to 70% was consumed in the controls."
11,Volatile fatty acids production,"3.3 Volatile fatty acids production The major volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced were lactate, acetate, propionate and butyrate (data not shown). Lactate was produced in the LUA, MA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA treated cultures. The MA treated cultures produced approximately up to 730 ± 150 mg L−1 of lactate until day 4 with levels reaching 3100 ± 210 mg L−1 on day 8. Samples treated with LUA, PA, and 50:50 MA:PA also accumulated lactate on day 8. The lactate levels detected in the LUA, PA and 50:50 MA:PA treated cultures were approximately 760 ± 35, 1200 ± 70 and 950 ± 75 mg L−1, respectively. The PA treated samples produced lactate only after the second glucose injection (days 5–8). Lactate production in the PA treated samples was associated with a decrease in the H2 yield after the second glucose injection compared to the H2 yield observed after the first glucose injection (days 1–4). Acetate was produced in all cultures under the various LCFA stress conditions. Acetate in the controls reached maximum levels of approximately 1500 ± 110 mg L−1 and 2500 ± 70 mg L−1 after the first and second glucose injection, respectively. In cultures treated with LUA, the acetate concentration reached 700 ± 140 mg L−1 on day 4 and this level was maintained following the second glucose injection. PA treated cultures produced approximately 1700 ± 110 mg L−1 and 2400 ± 85 mg L−1 acetate on day 4 and day 8, respectively. In comparison, cultures treated with the 50:50 PA:MA mixture produced less acetate when compared to other LCFA treated cultures (530 ± 110 mg L−1 and 550 ± 65 mg L−1 by days 4 and 8, respectively). Control samples produced propionate up to approximately 100 ± 70 mg L−1 after the first glucose injection (day 4) and approximately twice this quantity was detected after the second glucose injection. Increasing propionate concentrations were observed in the MA:PA treated cultures throughout the incubation period with levels reaching a maximum of 1150 ± 55 mg L−1 on day 8. The LUA treated cultures produced 196 ± 35 mg L−1 on day 4 and this level remained the same until day 8. Increasing butyrate concentrations from approximately 920 ± 70 mg L−1 to 1290 ± 10 mg L−1 and about 930 ± 50 mg L−1 to 1620 ± 70 mg L−1 4 days (day 4 to day 8) after the second glucose injection were detected in the controls and PA treated cultures, respectively. Butyrate was not detected in cultures treated with MA; however, cultures treated with the 50:50 MA:PA mixture produced approximately 350 ± 30 mg L−1 on day 4 and 930 ± 10 mg L−1 on day 8, respectively."
12,Alcohols production,"3.4 Alcohols production i-Propanol was produced at variable levels in cultures treated with LUA, MA, MA:PA, and PA (levels reached a maximum of about 1320 ± 150 mg L−1 on day 8). On day 8, the quantity of i-propanol produced in cultures fed with the different LCFAs was as follows: LUA > MA > MA:PA > PA. i-Propanol was not detected in the control cultures fed glucose. Ethanol was produced in all of the cultures in various quantities. LUA treated culture produced approximately 830 ± 130 mg L−1 ethanol 1 day after the first glucose injection and the levels reached about 900 ± 10 mg L−1 on day 4 and 1780 ± 70 mg L−1 on day 8. Cultures treated with MA:PA and PA produced ethanol in the order of 700 ± 65 mg L−1 and 310 ± 70 mg L−1, respectively, on day 8. The PA treated cultures produced more ethanol after the first glucose injection than after the second injection. In comparison, the MA treated cultures also produced smaller quantities of ethanol after the second glucose injection. On day 4, n-propanol was produced in the MA and MA:PA treated cultures to maximum levels reaching approximately 335 ± 70 mg L−1 and 680 ± 40 mg L−1, respectively. The MA:PA treated cultures accumulated increasing levels of n-propanol (up to 1030 ± 30 mg L−1) after the second glucose injection. n-Propanol was not detected in the controls, LUA and PA treated cultures. i-Butanol was produced in the controls, LUA and MA treated cultures. The control cultures produced i-butanol on day 1 (1 day after the first glucose injection) and maintained a constant level of approximately 100 ± 10 mg L−1 until day 5 (1 day after the second glucose injection) and then the concentration increased to a maximum of 470 ± 40 mg L−1 on day 8. In the LUA treated cultures, i-butanol was observed on day 4 and the level increased on day 6 to a maximum of 280 ± 0.0 mg L−1. The MA treated culture produced about 450 ± 50 mg L−l of i-butanol 1 day after the first glucose injection. Maximum levels of i-butanol detected in the MA treated cultures reached approximately 460 ± 30 mg L−l on day 4 and 630 ± 70 mg L−1 on day 8."
13,Electron mass balance,"3.5 Electron mass balance Electron mass balances are shown in Fig. 1 for the glucose and the glucose plus LCFA fed cultures. Cultures treated with PA converted approximately 21 ± 1% of the electron equivalents available in glucose to H2. This indicates a conversion efficiency of approximately 64 ± 2% was attained (based on a maximum of 4.0 mol of H2 per mol of glucose). Cultures treated with LUA diverted more electron equivalents to alcohols than cultures treated with other LCFAs (Fig. 1D). After the second glucose injection, approximately 30 ± 3% and 35 ± 1% of the electron equivalents were diverted to i-propanol and ethanol in LUA treated culture, respectively (Data not shown). Approximately the same quantity of electrons was diverted to acetate and butyrate in the glucose control cultures and those treated with PA."
14,Principal components analysis (PCA),"3.6 Principal components analysis (PCA) The PCA was conducted using the glucose degradation by-products data for all conditions to detect similarities and differences among the cultures treated with different LCFAs. The first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for approximately 72% of the total variability in the data (Fig. 2 ). PC1 was correlated with H2, acetate, butyrate, and i-butanol while PC2 was correlated with lactate, formate, ethanol, i-propanol and n-butanol. Responses for the control and PA treated cultures were close to each other (Fig. 2); however, the MA and LUA treated cultures were located remotely from the controls and PA treated culture suggesting that their responses were different. The MA:PA treated culture was closer and thus, more similar to the PA than the MA treated cultures."
15,Flux balance analysis,"3.7 Flux balance analysis The FBA was used to establish the dominant pathways and to indicate H2 sinks when various LCFAs were added to the mixed cultures. The results of the FBA showed the pathways for the maximum H2 yields for the controls, LUA, MA (Fig. 3 A), PA and MA:PA treated cultures (Fig. 3B). The quantity of H2 consumed was determined from the hydrogen flux reactions (R12 –R13) (Fig 3). The H2 consumption (mol mol−1 glucose) trend for the various treatment conditions was as follows: MA (0.49), LUA (0.39), PA (0.29), MA:PA (0.29) and control (0.08). The FBA showed the following H2 consumption (mol mol−1 glucose) trend for the homoacetogenic reaction (R17 in Fig. 3): 0.32 for PA, 0.24 for MA, 0.20 for LUA and 0.12 for the MA:PA treated cultures compared to 0.08 for the controls."
16,Microbiological analysis,"3.8 Microbiological analysis Microbial samples from the glucose controls and cultures treated with LA, MA, PA and MA:PA mixtures were analyzed using the T-RFLP method. The relative abundances of the dominating bands are shown according to their fragment size (bp) in Fig. 4 and the species included in each band in Table 4 . The PCA of the T-RFLP's profiles yielded 3 PC's which accounted for 89% (20.5% (PC 1) + 44.2% (PC 2) + 24.5% (PC 3)) of the variance in the data set (Fig. 5 ). The score maps for PC1–PC3 (Fig. 5A) and PC2–PC3 (Fig. 5B) accounts for approximately 65% and 44%, respectively, of the variance in the data set. Notice the similarity between the glucose controls, PA and MA treated cultures in the PC1–PC3 map while in the PC2–PC3 map, the MA and MA:PA treated cultures are similar and the differences between the controls, PA and MA treated cultures."
17,Discussion,"Decoupling the syntrophic relationship between H2 producers and H2 consumers in mixed anaerobic communities can be accomplished using a variety of chemical stressing agents [3–8]. Single LCFAs have been used as stressing agents to divert electron fluxes towards H2 production in mixed anaerobic communities [4–7]. To date, polyunsaturated LCFAs with 18-carbons (LA and OA) have been investigated as H2-consuming microorganisms inhibitors [4,5,7]. LCFAs shorter than C18 such as LUA, MA, and PA can also impose varying degrees of inhibition on many anaerobic populations. In this study, anaerobic mixed cultures produced different quantities of H2 when they were exposed to LCFAs containing less than 18 carbons (LUA, MA, PA, or 50:50 MA:PA). These LCFAs affected not only the H2 yield but also the distribution of by-products, the glucose degradation rates, the composition of the microbial community and the dominant species. The methane profiles for the LCFAs treated cultures suggested significant inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Although all of the LCFAs inhibited methane production, the H2 yields varied with the type of LCFA. The maximum H2 yield (2.53 ± 0.18 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) was attained in cultures treated with PA in comparison to cultures treated with LUA, MA or a 50:50 mixture of MA:PA. The H2 yield observed in cultures treated with LUA (1.10 ± 0.15 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) is unexpected because LUA is able to impose a stronger degree of inhibition on methanogens when compared to oleic acid (OA) or other LCFAs shorter than C18 [11]. In this study, LUA could inhibit selected H2 producers and this may explain the low H2 yield observed in the LUA treated cultures. Evidence from similar studies has shown reduced H2 and CH4 yields with increasing LUA levels [16]. When comparing the maximum H2 yield over the duration of the experiment, LUA, MA, and MA:PA treated cultures were statistically similar to each other; however, they were statistically different from the controls and the PA treated cultures. Notice the H2 yields for the controls and PA treated cultures were statistically similar. Based on the H2 yields, PA imposed a larger degree of inhibition on H2 consumers when compared to cultures treated with LUA, MA, or MA:PA. The H2 versus time profiles clearly show a growth associated relationship [44] for all the LCFAs tested. PA was seemingly less harmful to acidogenic H2 producers in comparison to MA and LUA. This argument is based on the higher H2 yield (Table 3) and the initial glucose degradation rate. The glucose degrading activity due to LUA was approximately 1.5 fold less in comparison to PA. Using the Tukey's test at a 95% confidence interval [20], the glucose initial degradation rates for MA, PA and the 50:50 mixture of MA:PA treated cultures were statistically the same but they were different from the controls and LUA treated cultures. The high H2 yield in the PA treated cultures was associated with a large fraction of electron flux directed to acetate and butyrate in comparison to the other LCFAs. Conversely, the low H2 yield observed for the LUA treated culture is associated with the production of elevated levels of reduced by-products such as lactate, i-propanol and ethanol [45]. The data suggest that PA changed the cellular metabolic conditions such that the H2 producing populations were able to produce a maximum yield via the combined acetate-butyrate fermentation pathways. A wide variety of by-products was observed in all cultures treated with LUA, MA, and MA:PA when compared to the controls and those fed PA. Alcohols were produced in cultures treated with LCFAs shorter than those bearing 16 carbons. In cultures fed with LUA, the low H2 yield correlated with elevated alcohol levels. On day 8, the percent electron equivalents diverted to the various alcohols were as follows for the various treatment conditions: LUA (68%) > MA:PA (42%) > MA (24%) > Control (9%) > PA (3%) (Fig. 1D). Notice the PA treated cultures with the maximum H2 yield were associated with low alcohol levels. In the controls and LCFA treated cultures, acetate and butyrate were produced in addition to lactate, propionate and alcohols. Lactate production and the formation of small quantities of propionate in the PA treated cultures after the second glucose injection likely contributed to the decrease in the H2 yield. Lactic acid formation is used as a mechanism to reduce the H2 partial pressure and subsequently, control the fermentation process [46]. The accumulation of reduced byproducts (lactate, propionate and ethanol) was likely due to the inhibition of hydrogen producing acetogens and methanogens [47]. The inhibition of acetogenic microorganisms as well as methanogens could likely be attributed to the combined effects of elevated H2 levels [47] and long chain fatty acids such as PA [47]. The effects of LUA and MA treatment on the by-products distribution in comparison to that observed for the PA treated cultures and controls are shown using the PCA (Fig. 2). The data points for the LUA, MA, and MA:PA treated cultures are located remotely from those for the PA treated and controls on the PC1 and PC2 plot. The by-products observed in the LUA and MA treated cultures were not ideal for maximizing the H2 yield. In order to maximize the H2 yield, the electron flux from glucose degradation should be directed towards acetate and butyrate instead of reduced by-products such as lactate and alcohols. The FBA (Fig. 3) showed that production of acetate (via homoacetogenesis) and the formation of alcohols were the major H2 sinks in cultures treated with LCFAs. The extent of these reactions was variable depending on the different LCFAs. Homoacetogenic microorganisms consumed more H2 in the LCFA treated cultures in comparison to the controls. Notice cultures fed MA, LUA, and MA:PA consumed more H2 (mol mol−1 glucose) [(R21) MA (0.19 ± 0.02), LUA (0.17 ± 0.05), and MA:PA (0.15 ± 0.02)] in the i-propanol producing reaction compared to the controls (0.01 ± 0.00) or PA treated cultures (0.00 ± 0.00) (Fig. 3). This trend is unanticipated because LCFAs possessing a lesser degree of inhibition on homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens are expected to consume H2 and subsequently produce acetate and methane, respectively. However, notice cultures fed LCFAs possessing lesser inhibitory characteristics produced reduced by-products (ethanol, i-propanol and lactate) in order to relieve the thermodynamic effects imposed by elevated H2 partial pressures. Although the lactate and alcohols levels were low in the glucose controls, the quantity of acetate and butyrate were greater in comparison to the inhibited cultures (data not shown). A wide variety of microorganisms survived after treating the cultures with different LCFAs. Eubacteria, a member of the homoacetogenic group, was predominant in the controls (28%) and lower levels were detected in cultures fed with LCFAs (LUA (1.4%), MA:PA (0.2%) and PA (0%)). Generally, a more diverse bacterial population was detected in the PA treated culture when compared to cultures treated with LUA, MA, or MA:PA. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (3%) was detected in the MA:PA treated culture. According to Maczulak et al. [48], PA at a threshold level (200 mg L−1) is capable of impairing the growth of B. Fibrisolvens. Thermoanaerovibrio acidaminovorans (60%) dominated the controls followed by Geobacillus sp. and Eubacterium sp. (28%) while Clostridium sp. constituted less than 1%. Evidence by Baldursson [49] has shown that T. acidaminovorans is a potential H2 producer and hence, a major contributor to the increased H2 yield in the PA treated cultures. In comparison to the controls, treating the culture with MA, MA:PA, or LUA increased the abundance of Clostridium plus Bacillus sp. to 67%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. In the PA treated cultures, the relative abundance of Clostridium plus Bacillus sp. was 34%–48% whereas T. acidaminovorans decreased to 7% and the abundance of Geobacter sp. and Bacteroides increased to 12 and 10%, respectively. Data from these studies clearly indicate organisms from the Clostridium and Bacillus genera survived the microbial stresses imposed by LCFAs. The maximum yield (2.53 ± 0.18 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) observed in the PA treated cultures containing Clostridium plus Bacillus sp. is comparable to the yield reported for a heat-treated inoculum (2.8 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) [50]. The maximum yield observed for the PA treated cultures also greater than that reported for studies conducted at low pH. Fang and Liu [51] and Khanal et al. [52] reported yields of 2.1 mol H2 mol−1 glucose at pH 5.5 and 1.7 mol H2 mol−1 glucose for a pH range of 4.5–6.5, respectively. Comparing the results from this study with previous work using LCFAs inhibited H2 producing cultures is shown in Table 5 . The H2 yield achieved in the presence of PA is greater than the yield achieved with OA (2.2 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) [53] and is comparable to that achieved with LA (3.1 mol H2 mol−1 glucose) [7]. Using LCFAs or heat treatment to inhibit or prevent of growth of H2 consumers in mixed anaerobic communities have been reported by several researchers, however: further work is required to assess the cost effectiveness of both treatment options. The technical feasibility of heat or LCFA treatment of mixed anaerobic cultures is not described in any study. Regarding its effectiveness to inhibit H2-consuming microorganisms, heat treatment is not sufficient to develop a suitable H2-producing microbial consortium [54] because it does not exclusively select these microorganisms [55]. According to Duangmanee et al. [56], repeated heat treatment cycles are necessary to increase H2 production. No work to date has fully evaluated the long term impact of using heat or LCFA treated cultures. Hydrogen producing technologies using mixed microbial studies are still evolving and data is lacking for an economic analysis of treatment options using heat or LCFA treated cultures."
18,Conclusions,"Although all the LCFAs (LUA, MA, and PA) examined suppressed H2 consumption in mixed cultures, their effects on H2 production were not the same. PA was the most effective in enhancing the H2 yield with a maximum reaching 2.53 ± 0.18 mol H2 mol−1 glucose for cultures treated with 7.13 mM PA. The control and PA treated cultures were similar; however, both were different from the MA treated and LUA treated cultures based on the PCA. PA imposed the largest inhibitory effects on H2-consumers and these cultures maintained a larger bacterial diversity based on the T-RFLP analysis. The FBA data showed that PA decreased the quantity of H2 consumed via homoacetogenesis compared to the other LCFAs. The results suggest that PA established conditions favoring the acetate pathway under which the maximum H2 yield was attained. Other LCFAs shorter than C16 directed the production of reduced by-products such as lactate, i-propanol and ethanol. The control culture was dominated by T. acidaminovorans (60%), Geobacillus and Eubacterium (28%) with Clostridium sp. less than 1%. Relative to the controls, treatment with PA, MA, MA:PA, or LUA increased the Clostridium plus Bacillus sp. populations by 48%, 67%, 75%, and 87%, respectively. PA treatment increased the Geobacter and Bacteroides populations to 12% and 10%, respectively, and decreased T. acidaminovorans to 7%. PA treatment was able to produce a more diverse bacterial population compared to treatment with LUA, MA, or MA:PA."
