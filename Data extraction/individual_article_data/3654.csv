0,Introduction,"Presently, hydrogen is predominantly manufactured by catalytic reforming of light hydrocarbons (primarily, natural gas or naphtha) via steam methane reforming (SMR) process. Goals for energy security, sustainability and cleaner environment have resulted in a heightened interest in the use of vast domestic renewable resources such as biomass as a source of hydrogen. In this regard, biomass-derived methane-rich gases (BMG) such as landfill gas (LFG), biogas and digester gas are potentially important renewable resources for the near-future hydrogen production. LFG is generated by natural degradation of municipal solid waste (MSW) by anaerobic microorganisms and consists mainly of methane and CO2. Once the gas is produced, it is collected in a series of wells drilled into the landfill and connected by the system of pipelines. Biogas is generated by an anaerobic digestion of agricultural and animal waste. (It should be noted that sometimes the term biogas is broadly interpreted and refers to a gas produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation of any biodegradable organic matter including manure, sewage sludge, MSW, etc.). Likewise, a digester gas is produced at waste-water treatment plants by anaerobic decomposition of sewage/sludge. There are several advantages to using BMG as a feedstock for hydrogen production: (i) it is a domestic energy resource, which can be used to offset (at least, partially) hydrocarbon fuel imports, (ii) it is a local resource, thus, there would be no need for its delivery by means of an expensive pipeline system, (iii) it can be obtained at little or no cost, thereby helping to decrease the end-use cost, and (iv) can generate local employment. Most importantly, if not utilized, methane from BMG can pose more serious environmental damage than CO2 alone. According to estimates of global warming potential (GWP) of different greenhouse gases reported by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), methane is 21 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere when compared to CO2 over a 100-year time period [1]. Over the period of two and a half centuries, global average atmospheric concentrations of methane have increased 150% from approximately 700–1745 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) [2]. Once emitted, methane remains in the atmosphere for approximately 15 years (it is slowly removed from the atmosphere by a variety of chemical and photochemical reactions involving hydroxyl radicals). Methane is emitted from a variety of both human-related (anthropogenic) and natural sources. It is estimated that 60% of global methane emissions are related to human-related activities. Fig. 1 shows the major human-related sources of methane emissions in the US in 2001 in millions of tons (MT) [2]. The largest methane emission (about 10MT/year) comes from the decomposition of wastes in landfills accounting for about 34% of all methane emissions (28.85MT/year). The amount of methane generated depends on the quantity and moisture content of the waste and the design and management practices at the site. Manure management associated with domestic livestock and wastewater treatment plants are also among major methane emitters. Natural sources of methane include wetlands, permafrost, termites, oceans, methane hydrates, wildfires and other sources. Reduction in methane emissions from human-related sources is one of the most cost-effective ways to realize environmental benefits of GWP reduction in the near term due to the high GWP of methane. Although the resources of LFG and BG are vast and widely available throughout the country, they remain mostly unused. According to a recent study, only small portion (330 out of 2100) landfill sites in the US utilize LFG to generate heat or electricity, and over 500 landfills flare or burn the gas outright [3]. To put the numbers in perspective, the combined methane-generating capacities of seven landfills situated within 80km from the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) would be adequate to produce about 55ton per day of hydrogen (which is the capacity range of a large modern hydrogen plant). In Florida, 59 landfills generate about 1.6millionm3/day LFG (in methane equivalent) [4], which could yield up to 100,000ton of hydrogen per year. However, despite the large and widely available resources of LFG and BG, no large-scale commercial hydrogen production process based on these feedstocks has been implemented in the US yet (and, as far as we know, anywhere in the world). LFG and BG are very complex gaseous mixtures containing methane and CO2 along with small amounts of N2, O2, H2S and a variety of organic (e.g., non-methane hydrocarbons, alcohols, organic acids, esters) and element-organic (e.g., S-, N-, P-, Si-organic) compounds. Table 1 shows the composition of LFG, BG and digester gas from different sources (table depicts most important components of LFG and BG neglecting low-ppm level species). As seen from Table 1, the composition of these biomass-derived gases, in general, is quite similar although varies from one source to another: all of them contain CH4 and CO2 as major components with methane concentration exceeding that of CO2 in the gaseous mix. In this paper, we limit our discussion to LFG only, keeping in mind that all the process development issues discussed here are also applicable to other BMG such as biogas and digester gas. In principle, there are three routes to producing hydrogen from LFG (see Fig. 2 ). According to the first approach (Fig. 2A), LFG is combusted in a turbine (or an internal combustion engine) to produce electricity, which is then used to electrolytically split water to form hydrogen and oxygen. However, the overall energy efficiency of such a system will be quite low (15–20%) because of Carnot limitations during the combustion stage. In the second approach, methane is separated from LFG using any of the available conventional technologies (e.g., cryogenic absorption, amine-scrubbing, selective adsorption, membrane separation), and converted to hydrogen via the well-known SMR process (Fig. 2B). It should be noted, however, that the separation of methane from CO2 and other LFG components is an energy intensive and rather costly process. Furthermore, in many cases this may not be economically and environmentally the most desirable option, especially when the resources are not large enough or the sources are located in remote areas. In the third approach, LFG is directly (i.e., without first recovering methane) processed (or reformed) to synthesis gas (or syngas) and then to hydrogen via water–gas shift (WGS) and H2–CO2 separation stages (which are well-known commercial technologies) (Fig. 2C). This option is technically simpler and more flexible compared to the second approach (since, no CH4–CO2 separation stage is needed), and, potentially, more cost effective than the other two approaches. In this work, we focus on the development of hydrogen production process via catalytic processing of LFG according to the third approach described above. Since CH4 and CO2 are two predominant components of LFG, the latter could be processed to syngas according to a technological approach called CO2 reforming of methane (also known as “dry” reforming). This is a strongly endothermic reaction that is carried out catalytically at the temperature range of 800-950°C producing syngas with the H2:CO molar ratio of 1:1 according to the following chemical reaction: (1) CH 4 + CO 2 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO , Δ H ∘ = 247 kJ / mol . Practical implementation of CO2-reforming of methane faces several key challenges, and one of the most serious among them is deactivation of transition metal-based catalysts used due to deposition of carbon (or coke) formed during methane decomposition and CO disproportionation reactions. From the practical viewpoint, it is preferable to operate CO2-reforming of methane at moderate temperatures maintaining the CH4:CO2 ratio close to unity, which would require a catalyst that kinetically inhibits carbon formation under conditions that are thermodynamically favorable for carbon deposition [9]. Comprehensive reviews on the topic of CO2-reforming of methane using transition metal catalysts were recently published by Hu and Ruckenstein [9] and Bradford and Vannice [10]. With regard to catalytic reforming of LFG-derived CH4–CO2 mixtures the aforementioned technical difficulties are aggravated by two additional factors. First, the presence of S-, N-, Si- and halogen-containing compounds can readily poison the catalysts used in the reforming process. In principle, these harmful contaminants could be effectively removed from LFG before the reforming stage using conventional technologies (e.g., ZnO polishing, selective adsorption, scrubbing, etc.). For example, Spiegel and Preston demonstrated that the use of activated carbon (AC) beds resulted in 99% removal of sulfur and halide compounds from LFG produced at Groton (Connecticut) landfill site [6]. The second factor relates to the feedstock non-uniformity; specifically, methane concentration varies in a wide range and typically exceeds that of CO2 in the LFG mixture (in most cases, [ CH 4 ] = 55 – 65 vol % ). This leads to an undesirable methane decomposition reaction (2) that readily occurs at the operating temperatures of the reforming process: (2) CH 4 → C + 2 H 2 , Δ H ∘ = 76.0 kJ / mol . Nickel-, iron- and cobalt-based catalysts are known to be particularly active in methane decomposition reaction [11]. The product carbon (or coke) blocks active sites of the catalyst leading to its rapid deactivation. In principle, the deposition of coke could be prevented by either using highly selective catalysts (i.e., catalysts that promote CO2 reforming of methane, but suppress methane decomposition reaction), or adding an oxidizing agent to the CH4–CO2 feedstock that guards the catalyst against coke formation. In this paper, we explore analytically and experimentally some technological aspects of hydrogen production via catalytic processing of the CH4–CO2 mixtures mimicking the composition of a typical LFG. Of particular importance are issues related to the catalyst activity, stability and selectivity for CO2 reforming of methane. The effect of oxidizing agents (steam, oxygen) on the catalyst stability and process sustainability is determined. The technical feasibility of the process is validated on a pilot-scale hydrogen production unit with the capacity of 5kWth. Techno-economic analysis of the LFG-to-H2 process is also discussed."
1,Experimental,"A premixed gaseous mixture obtained from Holox, Inc. with the composition of CH4–56.9vol%, and CO2–43.1vol% (i.e., molar ratio of CH4:CO2 is 1.3) was used. This particular CH4:CO2 ratio mimics that of the LFG generated by a local landfill in Cocoa, Florida. For the sake of simplicity, the ppm-level impurities such as, H2S, halides and others were not included in the feedstock because they could be efficiently removed by off-the-shelf technologies before the reforming stage. Also, other typical impurities in LFG such as N2, O2 and non-methane hydrocarbons were not included in the feedstock because they are unlikely to affect the process chemistry and performance of the catalysts used. Argon (99.999vol%) and oxygen (99.5vol%) (Air Products and Chemicals) were used in the experiments. Steam was produced from deionized water and introduced into the reactor using a precision syringe pump (Cole Palmer) and an evaporator. A commercial reforming catalyst NiO (1–15wt%)/Al2O3, and a high-temperature WGS catalyst (Fe–Cr-oxides containing: 8–12wt% of Cr2O3 and small amounts of copper oxide) and a low-temperature WGS catalyst (wt%: ZnO 40–55, CuO 35–50, Al2O3 5–15, graphite < 5) were obtained from Süd-Chemie Inc. AC (coconut) was obtained from Fisher. In the bench-scale experiments, the catalysts were used in the form of 10–18 mesh granules. In a typical experiment, 0.5g of a catalyst was placed inside a quartz micro-reactor ( OD = 1.2 cm ) and purged with Ar at 600°C for 1h before start of the run. The reactor temperature was controlled using a type K thermocouple connected to a Love Controls temperature controller. All the experiments were conducted at the atmospheric pressure. The average residence time within the catalyst layer was about 1s. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface after each reforming experiment was determined by subjecting the catalyst to oxygen and measuring the amount of CO and CO2 produced from combustion of carbon. In the pilot-scale experiments, the reforming catalyst: NiO (1–15wt%)/Al2O3 and both high- and low-temperature WGS catalysts were used as received from the manufacturer (i.e., in the form of extrudates and pellets). A 0.30kg of Ni-catalyst was placed in a reforming (plug flow) reactor made of an Inconel-600 alloy with the outside diameter of 5.1cm and the length of 45cm. A 0.38kg of high-temperature WGS, and 0.45kg of low-temperature WGS catalysts were placed in the WGS reactors made of stainless steel 316 (the reactors dimensions are similar to the reforming reactor). The three reactors were positioned in Thermolyne 21100 tube furnaces with temperature controllers. The reacting gases were metered by mass flow controllers (MKS Instruments, Inc.) connected to a FieldPoint data acquisition and control module (National Instruments, Inc.), and the resulting mixtures were fed in the reforming reactor. The desired process flow rates were controlled using a LabVIEW 7.0 virtual instrument (National Instruments, Inc.). The pressure drop across the reforming reactor was continuously monitored while gas concentration measurements were taken periodically. Gas sampling stations for concentration measurements are positioned after the reforming reactor, the WGS reactors, the water condenser and the gas separation unit. The reforming, high- and low-temperature WGS reactor temperatures were maintained at 850, 450, and 200°C, respectively. Steam from the steam generator was preheated to 300°C before entering into the reactor. The steady state regime throughout the system was established in about 2h. The more detailed description of the pilot-scale unit and its operation is provided in Section 3.5. The gaseous products of the reforming reaction were analyzed gas chromatographically using two SRI- 8610A GC-TCD instruments: the first gas chromatograph used Ar as a carrier gas and a silica gel packed column, and the second one used He and Hayesep D B column."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of CH4–CO2 and CH4–CO2-oxidant mixtures,"3.1 Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of CH4–CO2 and CH4–CO2-oxidant mixtures In this work, AspenPlus TM chemical process simulator was used to determine equilibria of CH4–CO2 and CH4–CO2–Ox mixtures (where Ox is an oxidant). The reforming reactions were modeled using a Gibbs reactor minimizing the free energies in order to calculate the conversion rates at given operating conditions. The input parameters were: the feed composition and flow rate, inlet temperature and pressure, and the reactor temperature and pressure. To elucidate the effect of CH4/CO2 ratio on the products distribution, the methane-rich mixture ( CH 4 : CO 2 = 1.3 ) is analyzed along with the equimolar gaseous mixture ( CH 4 : CO 2 = 1 ) . Fig. 3 depicts the thermodynamic equilibrium compositions of two reacting CH4–CO2 mixtures: (A) CH 4 : CO 2 = 1 : 1 (molar), and (B) CH 4 : CO 2 = 1.3 : 1 (molar), at the temperature range of 300–1000°C and an atmospheric pressure. It is evident from the Fig. 3 that a significant amount of elemental carbon could be formed in both CH4–CO2 mixtures in a wide range of temperatures. In the case of equimolar reacting mixture (i.e., CH 4 : CO 2 = 1 : 1 ), carbon practically disappears from the products mix at temperatures above 850°C, and H2 and CO become predominant products with their molar fractions reaching a plateau. In contrast, the CH 4 : CO 2 = 1.3 : 1 mixture could produce a substantial amount of carbon that remains in the product mix over the entire range of temperatures (300–1000°C). It is noteworthy that at the upper range of temperatures, the latter mixture produces the syngas with the elevated H2:CO molar ratio of ∼ 1.3 (compared to H 2 : CO ≈ 1 ratio produced from the equimolar mixture). Evidently, the presence of carbon and superstoichiometric quantity of hydrogen (compared to CO) in the equilibrated reacting CH 4 : CO 2 = 1.3 : 1 mixture could be attributed to the methane decomposition reaction (2). The addition of steam to the CH4–CO2 mixture drastically alters the product slate (Fig. 4 A, B). Fig. 4A illustrates the effect of steam on the equilibrium composition of the CH 4 : CO 2 : H 2 O = 1.3 : 1 : 1.3 (molar) mixture (note that the molar CH4:H2O ratio is equal to one). It can be seen that the addition of steam resulted in the disappearance of carbon at T ⩾ 750 ∘ C and an increase in H2:CO ratio in the equilibrium mixture to about 1.6:1. Fig. 4B depicts the equilibrium molar fraction of the products of reforming of CH 4 : CO 2 : H 2 O = 1.3 : 1 : χ mixture as a function of H 2 O : CH 4 = χ molar ratio. It can be seen that hydrogen concentration is not affected appreciably by χ , whereas, CO concentration passes through a maximum at about χ = 0.3 . Methane concentration decreases with the increase in χ value, which could be explained by contribution of SMR reaction. Most importantly, carbon molar fraction markedly drops as H 2 O : CH 4 ratio increases, and carbon practically disappears at χ = 0.4 . The effect of oxygen on the thermodynamic equilibrium composition of CH4–CO2–O2 mixtures is depicted in Fig. 5 A, B. Fig. 5A shows equilibrium concentration of the products obtained from the mixture CH 4 : CO 2 : O 2 = 1.3 : 1.0 : 0.9 (molar) as a function of temperature (note, that in this mixture O2:CH4 ratio is equal to 0.69:1; the basis for selecting this particular ratio will be discussed in Section 3.4). The comparison of Figs. 5A and 3B indicates that the addition of oxygen diminishes the yield of hydrogen and increases the yield of water. Hydrogen yield reaches a maximum at about 720°C and slightly drops at higher temperatures. CO yield was also reduced, but to a lesser extent compared to H2. Carbon disappears as a reaction product at temperatures above 700°C. Fig. 5B depicts thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of products obtained from CH 4 : CO 2 : O 2 = 1.3 : 1 : θ mixture at 850°C and 1 atm as a function of O 2 : CH 4 = θ molar ratio in the mixture. Hydrogen molar fraction drops monotonically from about 0.5–0.35 with the increase in O2:CH4 ratio, whereas CO fraction reaches a maximum at O 2 : CH 4 = 0.17 : 1 . CO2 and H2O yields see monotonic increase with increasing O2:CH4 ratio (in particular, at θ > 0.15 ). Carbon molar fraction drastically drops to almost zero before O2:CH4 ratio reaches the value of 0.2. Methane yield is also reduced with an increase in O2:CH4 ratio, and completely disappears at θ = 0.6 . It can be concluded from the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations for the CH4–CO2–O2 mixture that carbon could be eliminated from the reforming reaction products at O2:CH4 values of θ > 0.2 , whereas, the thermo-neutrality condition for CH4–CO2 reforming process can be reached at θ ≈ 0.7 (at 850°C, 1atm)."
4,Ni-catalyzed reforming of CH4–CO2 and CH4–CO2–H2O mixtures,"3.2 Ni-catalyzed reforming of CH4–CO2 and CH4–CO2–H2O mixtures Experiments involving catalytic reforming of the CH4–CO2 and CH4–CO2–H2O mixtures employed commercial (Süd-Chemie Inc.) NiO (1–15wt%)/Al2O3 reforming catalyst (hereafter, it will be designated as Ni-catalyst). The objective was to explore the catalyst stability and process sustainability issues at the conditions favorable for carbon lay down (via decomposition of methane). Fig. 6 shows the products of reforming of the CH 4 – CO 2 = 1.3 : 1 mixture catalyzed by Ni-catalyst at 850°C. It can be seen that the process produced a syngas with the initial H2:CO ratio of about 1.3 (by volume) but as the experiment progressed the hydrogen concentration gradually dropped and CO concentration increased. Moreover, the steady-state regime was not reached within first 5h of the reaction. CO2 conversion gradually dropped over the course of the experiment. The reaction initial stoichiometry could be approximated by the following equation: (3) 1.3 CH 4 + CO 2 → 2.6 H 2 + 2 CO + 0.3 C . A significant quantity of carbon was produced during the reaction. In particular, the amount of carbon accumulated on the Ni-catalyst surface over period of 5h corresponded to a methane-to-carbon conversion yield of 15.3mol%. During the course of the reforming reaction, the catalyst was completely disintegrated (i.e., it was reduced from grayish pellets into a fine black powder). Disintegration of Ni- catalyst could be attributed to the growth of carbon particles inside the catalyst pores. These experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of the CH 4 : CO 2 = 1.3 : 1 mixture (see Fig. 3). This is an indication of high catalytic activity of Ni-catalyst for both CH4–CO2 reforming and methane decomposition reactions. These experimental observations evidence a major role played by methane decomposition reaction in the overall Ni-catalyzed CH4–CO2 reforming process (although the contribution of Boudouard reaction cannot be ruled out). Carbon produced by methane decomposition reaction blocks the catalytic active sites causing gradual deactivation of the catalyst, and, hence, a decrease in hydrogen concentration."
5,Effect of steam,"3.3 Effect of steam Carbon lay down on the surface of the Ni-catalyst could be prevented by addition of an oxidant (e.g., steam, or CO2, or oxygen, or combination thereof) to the CH4–CO2 feedstock. The effect of steam on the amount of deposited carbon on the Ni-catalyst surface was quantified in a series of experiments conducted at 850°C using variable steam/methane ratio ( steam / CH 4 = χ ) . It was found that the amount of coke produced is reduced considerably with the increase in the steam:CH4 ratio. In particular, at the molar ratio of H 2 O : CH 4 > 0.45 practically no carbon deposit was detected on the catalyst surface. These values are in a fairly good agreement with the value χ = 0.4 determined by AspenPlus TM simulation (see Fig. 4B). Fig. 7 shows the distribution of gaseous products obtained by Ni-catalyzed reforming of the CH 4 : CO 2 : H 2 O = 1.3 : 1 : 1.3 (molar) feedstock (note that steam to methane ratio in the reacting mixture was 1:1). The average concentrations of hydrogen and CO in the effluent gas were 58 and 34.5vol%, respectively. The H2:CO ratio in the presence of steam increased appreciably compared to the experiment where no steam was added (from H 2 : CO ≈ 1.3 to ≈ 1.7 ). Carbon dioxide concentration in the syngas also increased, evidently, due to competition between steam and CO2 for methane molecules. No carbon deposits were detected on the catalyst surface and there were no signs of Ni-catalyst degradation after 5h of reforming of the CH4–CO2–H2O mixture. The composition of syngas produced by Ni-catalyzed reforming reaction with the addition of steam is in a good agreement with the thermodynamic equilibrium data at the same temperature (for dry syngas) (see Fig. 4A). The experiments also demonstrated that steam/methane molar ratio of about 0.6 in the CH4–CO2–H2O feedstock would be adequate to prevent catalyst deactivation and ensure high overall methane conversion yield. It should be noted that this amount of steam is significantly less than that normally used in the SMR process, where steam to methane molar ratios are in the range of 3–4 [12]."
6,Autothermal reforming of CH4–CO2 mixture,"3.4 Autothermal reforming of CH4–CO2 mixture The advantage of adding oxygen to the reacting CH4–CO2 mixture is twofold: it hinders deposition of carbon on the Ni-catalyst surface and provides heat input to the strongly endothermic reforming process. The latter factor is very important from technical viewpoint as it allows carrying the process in an autothermal or thermoneutral regime. AspenPlus TM simulation was conducted to determine the amount of oxygen needed for reforming of the CH4:CO2 (1.3:1 molar) mixture in an autothermal regime. Fig. 8 depicts the process heat flow as a function of O2:CH4 ratio at a temperature of 850°C and P = 1 atm . It was determined that at the above conditions the reactor can be operated adiabatically at a molar ratio of about O 2 : CH 4 = 0.7 : 1 . A series of experiments on catalytic reforming of CH4–CO2–O2 mixtures at 850°C and atmospheric pressure using NiO (1–15wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst was also conducted. Fig. 9 depicts the molar fraction of reforming products obtained from CH 4 : CO 2 : O 2 = 1.3 : 1 : θ mixtures as a function of O 2 : CH 4 = θ molar ratio. Fig. 10 shows the amount of coke and water produced (in g/g catalyst) from the above mixture as a function of O 2 : CH 4 = θ molar ratio. It is evident from these results that addition of even small amounts of oxygen to the feedstock dramatically reduces the extent of carbon deposit, and at the molar ratio of O 2 : CH 4 > 0.2 only traces of carbon could be detected on the catalyst surface. A comparison of the experimental data with the AspenPlus TM simulation results (see Fig. 5B) indicates that good agreement exists between experimental and predicted values for the molar fractions of the reforming products, which points to high catalytic activity of the Ni-catalyst at these operating conditions. Evidently, addition of oxygen to the feedstock significantly improved the sustainability of the CH4–CO2 reforming process. On the down-side, using oxygen would add to the product cost (on the other hand, the use of air instead of O2 would make the gas separation system more complex and costly)."
7,Pilot-scale validation of hydrogen production via catalytic reforming of LFG-mimicking gas,"3.5 Pilot-scale validation of hydrogen production via catalytic reforming of LFG-mimicking gas A pilot scale hydrogen production unit with a capacity of 5kWth H2 was designed, fabricated and operated (see Fig. 11 A, B). Fig. 11B depicts a schematic diagram of the hydrogen production unit comprising three main systems: catalytic reforming, gas conditioning and hydrogen separation/purification subunits. CH4, CO2 and O2 were metered, mixed in a pre-determined proportion and delivered to a catalytic reformer filled with commercial NiO (1–15wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst. In order to achieve an autothermal regime in the catalytic reactor at the above temperature, the feed composition was maintained as follows: CH 4 : CO 2 : O 2 = 1.3 : 1.0 : 0.9 (molar). Fig. 12 depicts the temperature profile within the autothermal reformer and high- and low-temperature WGS reactors. It can be seen that the temperature within the catalytic reformer during the experiment was maintained at a fixed level of about 850°C, which is an indication of a sustainable autothermal regime in the reactor. Fig. 13 depicts the composition of the reformate gas after the catalytic autothermal reactor. A steady-state condition was reached within first 2h, and no catalyst deactivation occurred during the experiment. The average concentrations of H2, CO and CO2 in the effluent gas (after the reformer) were 43, 39 and 18vol%, respectively. The resulting syngas was directed to the gas conditioning subsystem, which consists of high- and low-temperature water gas shift (HT-WGS and LT-WGS, respectively) reactors. In WGS reactors, CO reacts with steam producing CO2 and more hydrogen according to the following chemical equation: (4) CO + ( H 2 O ) g → H 2 + CO 2 Δ H ∘ = - 41.5 kJ / mol . Fig. 14 shows the composition of the gaseous product after the HT-WGS reactor containing HT-WGS catalyst (Fe–Cr-oxides) obtained from Süd-Chemie Inc. The concentration of CO in the effluent gas dropped below 2vol%, whereas H2 and CO2 concentrations were maintained at about 58 and 40vol%, respectively. The gaseous product of the HT-WGS reaction entered the LT-WGS reactor containing Sud-Chemie Zn–Cu-oxide catalyst. After the LT-WGS reactor, CO concentration in the syngas was further reduced to about 0.1vol%. Steam was removed from the effluent gas in a series of condensers maintained at the range of temperatures from 15 to - 50 ∘ C . At the final stage of the process, hydrogen was separated from H2–CO2 mixture using a cryogenic adsorption (CA) sub-unit (exit CO2 stream after the cryogenic separation unit is not shown on the diagram). The CA system consists of a series of packed beds filled with an adsorbent that adsorbs and desorbs CO2 in a cyclic process. After screening a number of adsorbents including a variety of AC and molecular sieves, coconut-derived AC was chosen for the CA application. Hydrogen purity after the H2 separation/purification unit exceeded 99.9vol%."
8,Description of the proposed LFG-to-H2 process,"3.6 Description of the proposed LFG-to-H2 process Fig. 15 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process for production of hydrogen from LFG (for simplicity, only major process unit operations are shown, neglecting to include heat exchangers, compressors and other commonly used equipment). The excess moisture is removed from LFG in a water condensation unit via staged refrigeration (not shown in the scheme). H2S and other potentially harmful impurities (e.g., halides) are removed from LFG in an adsorber (1) using ZnO and AC beds. Most of non-methane hydrocarbons and condensable organics are also removed during the refrigeration and adsorption stages. As reported by Spiegel, for typical average concentrations of H2S in LFG, the time interval between replacing the adsorbent carbon materials is 5–6 months [6]. The pretreated LFG, which is essentially CH4–CO2 mixture with small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen, is mixed with steam (at a steam to methane molar ratio of 0.5–1) and enters an externally heated tubular reforming reactor (2) filled with Ni-catalyst, where it is converted to a syngas (predominantly, H2–CO mixture with small amounts of N2 and CO2). A portion of LFG is used as a fuel to provide heat input for the endothermic reforming process (via external heating of the reformer using air or oxygen). The resulting syngas is mixed with an additional amount of steam and introduced to the high-temperature WGS reactor (3) resulting in conversion of most of CO to H2 and CO2. Separation of H2–CO2 mixture is carried out in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit (4) (note that modern SMR plants utilizing PSA units typically do not include the low-temperature WGS stage). The off-gas from the PSA unit contains combustible gases: H2, CO, CH4, and is used as a fuel for providing supplemental heat input for the catalytic reformer (2). In an alternative technological approach (Fig. 15B), the LFG is mixed with oxygen and directed to an autothermal reformer (5). Since the reforming process is conducted in an autothermal (or thermo-neutral) regime, there is no need for the LFG and/or PSA off-gas to be used as a fuel for the external heating of the catalytic reactor (thus, in this case, any unrecovered hydrogen from the off-gas will be lost). The purity of hydrogen gas after the PSA unit typically exceeds 99.999vol%."
9,Techno-economic assessment of hydrogen production from LFG,"3.7 Techno-economic assessment of hydrogen production from LFG Flowsheeting and techno-economic evaluation of the LFG-to-H2 process was conducted using Aspen Plus TM chemical process simulator. Three scenarios were considered for modeling the process. They were: (1) the reforming process with the external heat input by combusting LFG with air (air-fired reforming), (2) the same external heat option, but using oxygen instead of air (oxygen-fired reforming), and (3) the autothermal reforming (by introducing LFG–O2 feed directly to the reformer). The tenet of these process options has been described in the previous section (see Fig. 15A, B). Process efficiency ( η ) is defined by the following equation: η = HHV H 2 , product HHV LFG , fuel + HHV LFG , feedstock + W compression × 100 ( % ) , where HHV is the higher heating value of hydrogen and LFG, and W is the compression work. The first law efficiencies for the air-fired, oxygen-fired and autothermal reforming options were determined to be 60%, 61% and 40%, respectively (based on HHV values). Thus, the process efficiencies for air- and oxygen-fired options are relatively high and very close to each other. Relatively low process efficiency of the autothermal option can be attributed to substantial loses of hydrogen from the PSA off-gas. The preliminary techno-economic assessment of all three scenarios was conducted to evaluate the commercial potential of the technology. The main objective was to determine whether it is more cost effective to locally (in Central Florida) produce hydrogen from LFG as opposed to shipping it in from the nearest large liquid hydrogen plant situated in Louisiana about 1000km away. Capital cost estimates were performed using the Icarus Process EstimatorTM (IPETM), which is part of the Aspen Engineering Suite. Individual process components are mapped into IPETM, and the process simulation results are transferred from Aspen PlusTM in order to size the equipment. All the components in the AspenPlus TM spreadsheet are equated to equipment types and then priced for the next largest size. All pricing data are taken from actual industry data. Engineering, procurement and construction costs are added to the project. Operating cost estimates were provided by the IPETM tool. Hydrogen production costs were determined for both gaseous and liquid hydrogen. Since no actual cost data for the LFG was found in the literature, the LFG cost was assumed to be $1.42/GJ (in NG equivalent) based on the data provided by a local landfill developer (essentially, it is the cost of removing water and particulates from LFG to the extent that it is suitable for recovering methane and pumping it to the NG pipeline). The composition of LFG used in the economic analysis is presented in Table 1 (LFG from local landfill in Cocoa, Florida). The capital cost estimates for the hydrogen liquefaction were taken from Ref. [13]. An average electricity rate was assumed at $0.052/kWh [14]. Compressor power requirement cost was added at the same rate. The operating and maintenance costs of H2 production were calculated assuming a plant lifetime of 20 years and a discount rate of 6%. A current gate purchase price of $650/ton O2 at NASA Kennedy Space Center was assumed for oxygen cost (for the oxygen-fired and autothermal reforming cases) [15]. In addition, an evaporator capital cost was added and amortized. The cost of CO2 sequestration was also considered in order to account for possible environmental impact of the proposed technology. Sequestration of CO2 generated in the process would result in a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the release of LFG directly to the atmosphere. To account for CO2 sequestration, an additional capital cost estimation for CO2 compression equipment is included along with the corresponding cost of electricity at the $0.052/kWh rate. US Department of Energy cost estimates for CO2 sequestration utilizing currently available technology are used in the analysis [16]. The techno-economic assessment of the LFG-to-H2 process was performed for a wide range of capacities from less than 1ton H2 per day to 20ton per day of hydrogen; this allows determination of the economy of scale for all three scenarios (i.e., with air- and oxygen-fired and autothermal reforming options). A regression analysis was performed to give an approximate cost of hydrogen on a per kilogram basis. Three separate cases were analyzed: (1) gaseous hydrogen production without CO2 sequestration, (2) liquid hydrogen production without CO2 sequestration, and (3) liquid hydrogen production with CO2 sequestration (Fig. 16 A–C). Fig. 16A shows simulation results obtained for the first case, i.e., where gaseous hydrogen is produced. Clearly, the unit cost of gaseous hydrogen produced drops significantly as the H2 plant capacity is increased. The air-fired reforming process is more cost effective on per kilogram of H2 gas basis than an oxygen-fired process. The autothermal reforming option is economically the least attractive because of high oxygen cost and hydrogen losses associated with the PSA off-gas. In case of liquid hydrogen production (Fig. 16B), the trend is identical, but the hydrogen production costs for all three options increase significantly due to high H2 liquefaction costs. Fig. 16C presents results for the analysis of liquid hydrogen production with CO2 sequestration. It can be seen that the air-fired reforming option remains economically most attractive, although the cost of hydrogen production is increased due to the added cost of CO2 sequestration. However, the trend was reversed for the O2-fired and autothermal reforming, making O2-fired case as the least attractive option. As a point of reference, we note that the cost of liquid hydrogen delivered to NASA-KSC at the Central Florida is about $4.5–5.0/kgL-H2 [15]."
10,Conclusions,"The technical and economical feasibility of hydrogen production from renewable methane-rich gases such as LFG, biogas and digester gas were analytically and experimentally evaluated in this paper. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations for the reformation of CH4–CO2, CH4–CO2–H2O and CH4–CO2–O2 mixtures were conducted using AspenPlus TM chemical process simulator. The technical issues related to the catalytic reforming of LFG and biogas stem from the fact that at the reformation temperature of 850°C, these methane-rich gases tend to produce carbon via methane decomposition that deactivates the catalysts used by blocking off the active sites of the catalysts. The deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface could be prevented by adding steam or oxygen to the feedstock. In particular, addition of relatively small amounts of steam mitigates Ni-catalyst deactivation and significantly improves the process sustainability. Addition of oxygen to the feedstock not only prevents build-up of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, but also provides heat input for the endothermic process—thus, allowing for the process to operate in an autothermal or thermo-neutral regime. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis indicated that the condition of thermo-neutrality for the reforming process could be achieved at a O2 to CH4 molar ratio of about 0.7:1 in the feedstock. Hydrogen production by processing of LFG-mimicking gas was experimentally validated using a 5kWth unit comprised of catalytic reforming, gas conditioning and H2 separation/purification sub-systems. Hydrogen with the purity of 99.9vol% was obtained. Three scenarios distinguished by the mode of heat input to the process (i.e., external vs autothermal) were modeled using AspenPlus TM chemical process simulator. The reforming process using an external heat input and air for combustion gives an overall first law efficiency of approximately 60%. This scenario is particularly advantageous because PSA produces hydrogen with very high purity, and the PSA off-gas can be used in the combustor. A preliminary economic assessment indicates the liquid hydrogen product costs in the range of $3.00–$7.00 per kilogram depending upon the production rate, heat input option and if carbon sequestration is included in the scheme. Hydrogen production options involving autothermal reforming and external heat input using O2 for combustion were economically less attractive, mostly due to the high cost of oxygen required."
