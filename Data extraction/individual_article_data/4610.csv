0,Introduction,"Waste activated sludge (WAS), an inevitable byproduct formed during the activated sludge process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and the yearly increasing amounts produced have become a huge challenge for treatment and disposal. Approximately 40 million tons of WAS (80% moisture content) was generated in 2015; this value has steadily increased, with an annual growth of 13% in China, and will further increase to 60 million tons in 2020 (Meng et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015a). Considering the resource characteristics of WAS (organics and nutrients account for 90–95% by dry weight), many researchers have concentrated on converting WAS to valuable products, e.g., volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (He et al., 2019), methane (Mao et al., 2015), hydrogen (Wang et al., 2019b) or biofuels (Manara and Zabaniotou, 2012). Hydrogen has tremendous potential as a promising alternative clean energy; its combustion product has zero pollution (only water), and it possesses a higher energy density of 120 MJ/kg than other gaseous fuels (i.e., methane (50 MJ/kg) and ethanol (26.8 MJ/kg)) (Kadier et al., 2016). Dark fermentation and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are two feasible technologies to recover hydrogen from WAS (Kadier et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2018). MECs, an effective approach for high-purity hydrogen generation, are less restricted than anaerobic fermentation because they can exploit a wide range of organics as feedstocks (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, VFAs and ethanol) (Lu et al., 2011). In contrast to bioelectrolysis alone, coupling with anaerobic fermentation can effectively enhance the hydrogen yield. Our previous study produced a 0.54 mL/g VSS hydrogen yield in a system consisting of prefermentation and MECs (AD-MECs) but only 0.17 mL/g VSS in sole MECs fed with WAS (Zhou et al., 2019). Khongkliang et al. obtained 465 mL H2/g COD in a fermentation and MEC system, while that in the sole MEC system was only 182 mL H2/g COD (Khongkliang et al., 2017). However, the hydrogen yield in AD-MECs is still limited when using raw WAS as the feedstock because most organics are trapped in microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which restricts conversion from biodegradable organics to hydrogen (Li et al., 2019a). Therefore, appropriate pretreatment is required to ensure that organics are released and readily available for subsequent cascading conversion. Free nitrous acid (FNA), which can be produced as a byproduct in situ through the nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor in WWTPs, is an eco-friendly, low-cost and renewable chemical (Law et al., 2015). It has been reported that FNA and its derivatives, at the parts per million (ppm) level, are effective in damaging the cell membrane and destroying intracellular macromolecular organics of microorganisms (Jiang et al., 2011). Zhang et al. found that FNA could lead to WAS decomposition by triggering the crack of macromolecules, especially proteins in EPS (Zhang et al., 2015). While the further exploration according to the research of Wu et al. revealed that FNA was extremely effective in membranolysis rather than EPS decomposition (Wu et al., 2018). In a word, the effect of FNA on EPS decomposition is still uncertain. Thus, assistive technologies have been explored to fill the gap left by FNA, such as physical (i.e., heat and ultrasound) and chemical methods (i.e., surfactants and Fenton) (Hallaji et al., 2018, Niu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014b; Zhao et al., 2016). However, these technologies are either eco-unfriendly or energy consuming. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a broad-spectrum anti-microbial disinfectant (E0 = 1.81 eV) that forms no toxic byproducts. Relevant studies have proven the effectiveness of PAA in EPS decomposition and cell destruction via the formation of hydroxyl radical (•OH), which further enhances the biodegradability of WAS. Appels et al. demonstrated the effective solubilization of organics by PAA and a 21% increase in methane production from WAS (Appels et al., 2011). Zhang et al. indicated that PAA can effectively dissolve bound EPS into soluble EPS, especially under acidic conditions (Zhang et al., 2016). Therefore, employing PAA as an assisted pretreatment for FNA, may lead to cumulative effect on WAS disintegration. This proposal was mainly based on the following hypotheses: (1) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and acetic acid (HAc) as two decomposition products of PAA, may react with FNA to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (i.e., •OH, •NO, •NO2 and peroxynitrite (ONOO−/ONOOH), meanwhile, HAc can not only maintain the acidic environment required for FNA generation, but also provide metabolic substrate for microorganism (e.g., nitrate-reducing bacteria); (2) no toxic byproducts would be generated by coupling of FNA and PAA; (3) the convenience for raw materials acquisition: FNA can be produced in-situ as a byproduct during wastewater treatment, and PAA is widely applied in the medical and food disinfection. This study aimed to investigate (1) whether more effective EPS decomposition and organics transformation could be achieved under FNA and PAA co-pretreatment than under sole pretreatment and (2) whether the hydrogen yield, organics utilization and electrochemical properties could be further promoted in co-pretreated WAS in a prefermentation-bioelectrolysis cascading system. To achieve the above goals, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was performed to explore the underlying mechanism of PAA and FNA co-pretreatment. A proof-of-concept based on experimental data for the corresponding release and cascading utilization of organics in the whole cascading system was presented. In addition, the enhancement of electrochemical performance in the MEC step by co-pretreatment was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The enrichment and interaction of different functional microorganisms were revealed by high-throughput sequencing, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and molecular ecological network analysis (MENA)."
1,Material and methods,
2,WAS characteristics,"2.1 WAS characteristics The WAS used in this study was obtained from a municipal WWTP located in Jinzhong City, China. Before the experiment, the WAS was filtered by using a 40 mesh sieve to remove impurities and concentrated by gravitational settling (4 °C, 24 h). The main characteristics of the condensed WAS (named RWAS) were as follows: pH 7.1 ± 0.1, total suspended solids (TSS) 21.3 ± 0.2 g/L, volatile suspended solids (VSS) 13.0 ± 0.2 g/L, total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) 14.7 ± 0.4 g/L, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) 0.44 ± 0.02 g/L, soluble proteins 101.5 ± 3 mg COD/L, soluble carbohydrates 23.6 ± 1 mg COD/L, and VFAs 224.3 ± 10 mg COD/L."
3,Cascading treatment procedure of WAS,"2.2 Cascading treatment procedure of WAS The whole treatment process was divided into three steps: pretreatment (step I), prefermentation (step II) and bioelectrolysis (step III). Step I: Three pretreatments were performed: FNA, PAA and FNA + PAA. For FNA pretreatment, 2.13 mg N/L FNA was prepared by adding nitrite stock solution to 2.4 L WAS, in accordance with our previous study (Liu et al., 2018). Then, 1 M HCl was used to regulate the pH to 5.5 ± 0.1, and the mixture was incubated for 12 h at 22 ± 1 °C (named FWAS). PAA pretreatment was conducted by adding a PAA concentration of 100 mg/g VSS, in accordance with Appels et al. (2011) (named PWAS). For FNA + PAA pretreatment, FWAS was subjected to PAA pretreatment (named FPWAS). Step II: Twelve fermenters with a working volume of 400 mL each were divided into four groups (run in triplicate) for anaerobic prefermentation. RWAS, FWAS, PWAS and FPWAS were the feedstocks for the four groups (named AD-RWAS, AD-FWAS, AD-PWAS and AD-FPWAS, respectively), and fresh WAS was added as inoculum (1:9 (v/v)). Nitrogen was pumped into each bottle, which was then capped, sealed, and stirred in an air-bath shaker (120 rpm) for 4 d at 35 ± 1 °C. Step III: Twelve single-chamber MECs were constructed. Each reactor had a working volume of 200 mL (6 cm diameter × 8 cm height), and a graphite fibre brush (3 cm diameter × 6 cm length, 0.22 m2 surface area) and carbon cloth (18 cm2 surface area; 0.5 mg Pt cm−2) were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. Each reactor was fed with 1.5 g/L sodium acetate in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 100 mM) and 1% mineral and vitamin solutions. Fresh WAS was inoculated during the first three cycles. Then, the acetate concentration was adjusted to 1.0 g/L, and MECs were run for no less than ten 24-h cycles at 22 ± 1 °C with a voltage of 0.8 V. The current and coulombic efficiency were monitored in real time until stable. Subsequently, the reactors were divided into four groups and fed with fermented RWAS, FWAS, PWAS and FPWAS, hereinafter named AD-RMEC, AD-FMEC, AD-PMEC and AD-FPMEC, respectively."
4,EPS extraction and identification,"2.3 EPS extraction and identification Two kinds of EPS, i.e., loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), were extracted based on the heat protocol (Wang et al., 2018b). Carbohydrates and proteins, the major components of EPS, were analysed in different WAS fractions, i.e., dissolved organic matter (DOM), LB-EPS and TB-EPS. More detailed information on proteins and metabolites was obtained by three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy (RF-6000, Shimadzu, Japan), and the scanning conditions were consistent with our previous research (Zhou et al., 2017). The EEM spectrum consisted of five regions according to different excitation-emission wavelengths (Li et al., 2019b), and the quantitative calculation method was based on the research of Wang et al. (2019a)."
5,Illumina MiSeq sequencing and analysis,"2.4 Illumina MiSeq sequencing and analysis Sludge samples were collected from the prefermentation (4 d) and MEC (4 d, biofilms in carbon brushes) steps. Before DNA extraction, the carbon brushes were dipped in aseptic water and centrifuged at 8000 g. The amplicon of the 16S rRNA gene was obtained using the specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers 515F and 806R with barcodes. Then, the PCR products after purification and quantification were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The raw sequence (No. SRR10337354) was submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive database. CCA was performed and visualized using Canoco 4.5. Molecular ecological networks (MENs) were constructed to reveal the inherent connections between the key microbiomes existing in the anaerobic prefermentation and MEC systems based on the random matrix theory interface method (Deng et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2010). The original data were uploaded to a network analysis pipeline (http://ieg2.ou.edu/MENA/) to analyse the topological properties (Lin et al., 2019). The relative networks were visualized by Cytoscape 3.7.1 software."
6,Analysis and calculation methods,"2.5 Analysis and calculation methods TCOD, SCOD, TSS and VSS were measured according to standard methods. VFAs, hydrogen, proteins and carbohydrates were analysed as previously described (Liu et al., 2018). The particle size distribution was determined by a laser particle size analyser (Bettersize 2000). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi JSM-7100F) was performed to obtain the morphology of the WAS and biofilm samples. Chemical species (C, O, N and P) were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, THERMO 250xi, America). Free radicals were detected via EPR (JES-FA300 spectrometer, Japan) by using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, 0.1 M) as the spin trapping agent. CV was performed by an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI660, China). The scanning speed was 10 mV/s, and the scanning area ranged from −0.8 V to 0.2 V. EIS was operated over a frequency range of 1 × 106 to 0.01 Hz with a scanning rate of 10 mV/s. The data analysis was conducted via ZSimpWin software."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Mechanism of how co-pretreatment promotes WAS disintegration and EPS decomposition,"3.1 Mechanism of how co-pretreatment promotes WAS disintegration and EPS decomposition 3.1.1 Effect of sole/co-pretreatments on WAS disintegration The SEM images intuitively reflect the degree of WAS disintegration. As shown in Fig. 1 A, masses of cocci and bacilli were clustered together and embedded within the gel-like EPS matrix in RWAS. Obvious cracks in the microbial cells and numerous clear holes appeared in FWAS, which was mainly due to the biocidal effect of FNA, while cellular aggregation still existed because of EPS protection. For PWAS, the microstructure was less compact and rougher, and very few complete cells could be found due to the strongly oxidizing H2O2 generated by PAA. Furthermore, the flocs in FPWAS were barely formed, and the rigid gel matrix and the cells displayed the worst disruption, implying that co-pretreatment provided the strongest oxidation compared with the sole pretreatments. The particle size distributions provided direct evidence for this conclusion (Fig. S1). FPWAS exhibited the lowest d50 value (31.0 μm), followed by PWAS (32.9 μm), FWAS (34.4 μm), and RWAS (37.1 μm). 3.1.2 Effect of sole/co-pretreatments on EPS decomposition The five regions of the fluorescence spectra of DOM and TB-EPS are exhibited in Fig. 1B and C. Overall, the fluorescence intensities of all five regions were enhanced in DOM after the three pretreatments. Region I (tyrosine-like substances, ex/em: 220–250/200-330 nm) and region IV (soluble microbial byproduct-like substances, ex/em: 250–280/200-380 nm) were the prominent substances in DOM. For example, Region I had the highest value in PWAS (41.3%), followed by FWAS (38.6%) and FPWAS (38.1%); all of these values were greater than that of RWAS (36.1%). In addition, the P i, n of Region I and Region II (tryptophan-like proteins, ex/em: 200–250/330-380 nm) decreased significantly in FPWAS and PWAS, suggesting that the radicals generated by PAA may contribute to the degradation of amino acids. This result was further proven by the TB-EPS spectra, which showed a corresponding decrease in fluorescent intensity after the three pretreatments; FPWAS had the lowest value (Fig. 1C). Co-pretreatment caused the most effective release of particulate proteins and carbohydrates, and the concentrations dropped by 47.6% and 68.0%, respectively, with respect to those of RWAS, while those obtained in FWAS were only 38.8% and 46.7% (Fig. 1D and E). This result implied that the introduction of PAA accelerated the exfoliation of TB-EPS into DOM. The concentration of soluble protein increased by 8.3-fold in FPWAS compared with that in RWAS, followed by PWAS (5.0) and FWAS (2.0). Moreover, FPWAS possessed the highest concentration of soluble carbohydrate, 1.6- and 2.6-fold that of FWAS and PWAS, respectively. In conclusion, co-pretreatment showed much greater promise than the sole pretreatments for EPS decomposition. 3.1.3 Identification of the active oxidants contributing to co-pretreatment The underlying mechanism of the co-pretreatment process is exhibited in Fig. 2 . •NO and •NO2, common reactive nitrogen species, are first generated through the acid-base dissociation of FNA (HNO2, pKa = 3.4 at 25 °C) in WAS. These species oxidize many kinds of compounds, such as amino acids, proteins and several unsaturated fatty acids, by electron transfer, double bond addition or hydrogen abstraction (Pérez-González et al., 2016). N2O3 and N2O4 exist as intermediates and are finally converted to NO2 − and NO3 −, respectively (Jiang and Yuan, 2013). Subsequently, the added PAA is decomposed to HAc and H2O2 in aqueous solution. H2O2 reacted with FNA to produce peroxynitrites (ONOO− and ONOOH), endogenously produced nucleophilic oxidants, which can easily diffuse into lipid membranes and damage the structures of various proteins, lipids and DNA in cells, eventually leading to cellular apoptosis (Prolo et al., 2018). ONOO− can be reversibly converted into •NO and •O2 −. ONOOH (pH = 5.4, 25 °C) can decompose rapidly into approximately 70% nitrate and 30% •NO2 and •OH under acidic conditions (Ferrer-Sueta et al., 2018). The EPR spectra demonstrated that higher intensities of both DMPO•-OH and DMPO•-O2 - were observed in FPWAS than in PWAS, according to their hyperfine splitting constants, further supporting the aforementioned results (Fig. 2B and C). The chemical equations involved in co-pretreatment are illustrated in Table S2. Hence, the synergistic effect of FNA, PAA and various intermediates (•NO, •NO2, N2O3, N2O4, ONOO−/ONOOH, •OH and •O2 −) led to the thorough disruption of WAS cells and the EPS matrix and provided more soluble substrates for the subsequent recovery process."
9,Release and utilization of organics in the cascading system,"3.2 Release and utilization of organics in the cascading system VFAs can be converted persistently from the acidification of soluble carbohydrates and proteins. Overall, the VFA concentration sharply increased and peaked at 96 h (prefermentation, step II) and then decreased over time during MEC operation (step III) in all groups (Fig. 3 A). The maximal VFA concentrations were 2594 ± 84, 6453 ± 40 and 7679 ± 86 mg COD/L in AD-FWAS, AD-PWAS and AD-FPWAS, respectively, while that obtained in AD-RWAS was only 868 ± 11 mg COD/L (Fig. 3B). Although the decomposition of PAA led to a considerable HAc increase (1102 ± 22 mg COD/L, detected from 1.3 g/L PAA), the net VFA production achieved in AD-FPWAS was much higher than that obtained in AD-PWAS and AD-FWAS. Remarkably, the pretreatments changed the distribution of VFAs. HAc, the most prevalent constituent, accounted for 50.5% in AD-RWAS and increased to 77.0% and 67.9% in AD-PWAS and AD-FPWAS (deducted HAc from PAA), respectively, while it was 44.1% in AD-FWAS. Increased HAc generation benefited hydrogen recovery in the subsequent MEC step. Additionally, more valeric acid (HVa) accumulated in AD-FPWAS (326.0 mg COD/L) than in the other samples, which indicated that much more protein participated in the acidification process. Efficient cascading conversion of VFAs happened in the MEC step, and the utilization efficiency reached 61.1% in AD-FPMEC, 8.4% and 21.1% higher than that in AD-FMEC and AD-PMEC, respectively (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D and E illustrate the evolution of organics in different WAS fractions during the three operation steps. Apparently, the cascading system played a pivotal role in organics release from TB-EPS. The release efficiencies of proteins and carbohydrates from TB-EPS in AD-FPMEC reached 80.6% and 79.8%, respectively, during the 96-h prefermentation step and further increased to 87.4% and 93.9% during the 96-h bioelectrolysis step (at 192 h), respectively. The variations in fluorescent substances in TB-EPS are reflected in Fig. S2. The fluorescence intensities weakened in each step throughout the cascading treatments and reached a minimum in the co-pretreatment group. The rheological characteristics and incompact structure of LB-EPS suggested that it can adsorb and transport organics from intracellular substances or TB-EPS to the liquid phase (Sheng et al., 2010). The small proportion of soluble organics stored in LB-EPS was nearly the same during the operation of each step. The variations in soluble organics in DOM after every step were also investigated (Fig. 3D and E). A continuous increase in soluble organics was observed in AD-RMEC, with a peak at 192 h, while opposite tendencies were obtained in the other groups. The highest utilization efficiencies of proteins (42.2%) and carbohydrates (56.9%) were obtained in AD-FPMEC, followed by AD-PMEC (27.5% and 24.3%, respectively) and AD-FMEC (17.7% and 15.4%) at 192 h, which showed remarkable superiority to traditional AD. Yang et al. obtained 32.2% and 49.7% utilization of proteins and carbohydrates in WAS after 42-d AD treatment, respectively (Yang et al., 2015b). The effective utilization of proteins in AD-FPMEC is further reflected in Fig. S3 and Table 1 , in which the relative abundance of region I + IV decreased steadily and finally reduced to a minimum of 29.8%. Co-pretreatment can not only shorten the treatment time but also enhance the utilization of organics, especially proteins, in cascading systems."
10,Biohydrogen recovery and electrochemical analysis,"3.3 Biohydrogen recovery and electrochemical analysis The hydrogen and current generated with the utilization of organics in step III are shown in Figs. 3C and 4A , respectively. The current increased dramatically with the feeding of prefermented WAS, then decreased and tended to become stable. The highest current was 6.3 A/m2 in AD-FPMEC, followed by 4.5 A/m2 and 4.0 A/m2 in AD-PMEC and AD-FMEC, respectively. The current in AD-RMEC was only 3.6 A/m2. For hydrogen recovery, AD-FPMEC achieved the highest yield of 10.8 ± 0.30 mg/g VSS, which was 1.4- and 1.7-fold that in AD-PMEC and AD-FMEC, respectively (Fig. 3C). The cascading conversion system fed with co-pretreated WAS, i.e., AD-FPMEC, showed highly superior hydrogen production compared with that in relevant studies. Niu et al. obtained 24.81 ± 1.24 mL H2/g VSS (equivalent to 2.21 mg H2/g VSS) after 20 d of dark fermentation of WAS pretreated with ultrasonication and FNA (Niu et al., 2019). Yields of 8.50 and 5.4 mg H2/g VSS were generated during the cascading utilization of WAS pretreated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and PAA, respectively (Wang et al., 2014a). The results of CV scanning showed that double layer capacitance formed between the electrode and biofilm to store exoelectrons, which could reflect the average current generated in MECs (Liang et al., 2011). AD-FPMEC generated the highest current (0.023 A) and had the largest double layer area, in contrast to the currents of 0.015 and 0.018 A generated by AD-FMEC and AD-PMEC, respectively. Moreover, the oxidation peak at approximately −0.36 V vs. SCE in both turnover (Fig. 4B) and nonturnover (Fig. S4) conditions was the characteristic peak of Geobacter sulfurreducens, which indicated that the corresponding redox components, e.g., heme groups in cytochrome, mainly existed in the biofilm and transferred electrons between the electrode and biofilm (Jain et al., 2011). However, the peak current was linearly dependent on the square root of the scan rate (insets, Fig. S4), which reflected that the electrochemical redox reaction was a diffusion-controlled process. In other words, efficient pretreatment, especially co-pretreatment, enhanced the capability of electrochemical catalysis during bioelectrolysis, which was mainly attributed to the enrichment of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB). This relationship was further demonstrated by the visible microorganisms adhered to the electrodes in the MECs (Fig. S5). More rod-shaped microorganisms were attached to the bioanode and biocathode in AD-FPMEC than in the other three groups. The EIS results showed that the conductivity of WAS was clearly enhanced by pretreatment (Table S1). AD-FPMEC exhibited the lowest resistance of 10.8 Ω, followed by AD-PMEC (15.6 Ω), AD-FMEC (20.3 Ω) and AD-RMEC (27.6 Ω) (Fig. 4C and Table S1). This result indicated that co-pretreatment could enhance the transfer efficiency related to the redox process. Moreover, the lower diffusion resistance (Rdiff) in AD-FPMEC (6.2 Ω) accelerated the rate of electron and mass transfer between the electrode and EABs compared to those of AD-FMEC (11.7 Ω) and AD-PMEC (10.5 Ω)."
11,XPS analysis of different WAS cascading treatment systems,"3.4 XPS analysis of different WAS cascading treatment systems Four WAS samples after 192 h of cascading treatment were analysed by XPS C 1s, O 1s, N 1s and P 2p spectra. Overall, C and O occupied the two largest proportions in the four samples (Table 2 ). The spectra of C 1s (Fig. 5A1 and A2 ) contained four representative peaks. The characteristic peak of C1 (C- (C, H), 284.8 eV) was from hydrocarbon-like compounds (i.e., lipids, amino acid side chains and polysaccharides) (Wang et al., 2018a). The abundance of C1, the predominant component of EPS, increased after pretreatment, which implied the efficient decomposition of EPS. The peak at 286.1 eV (C2) was attributed to C- (O, N) bonds from ethers, alcohols, amines and amides (Wang et al., 2018a). AD-FPMEC showed the most apparent decline in the binding area of C2 compared with that of AD-RMEC, which indicated that co-pretreatment indirectly caused the most effective transformation of macromolecular organics in the cascading system (Table 2). The weak peak (C3) at 288.0 eV was closely related to O–C–O and C O, which mainly existed in amide, carboxylate, carbonyl, acetal and hemiacetal groups. Notably, the bonds of C4 (O C−OR and O C–OH, 288.5 eV) and O2 (C O, 531.2 eV), commonly from carboxyl or ester groups (Appala Raju et al., 2008), increased in AD-FPMEC, further proving that co-pretreatment led to considerable accumulation of VFAs during the prefermentation step. After bioelectrolysis utilization, the residual VFAs were still much higher than those in AD-RMEC, which was consistent with the results of Fig. 3A and B. As shown in Table 2, the binding area of N1 (N–C-R, 399.6 eV), from the amide functions of proteins and peptide chains (Yu et al., 2018), achieved the minimum in AD-FPMEC, indicating that co-pretreatment led to the most effective utilization of proteins. This result is also intuitively reflected in Fig. 5B1 and B2 by the accumulation of H–N–CO (N2, 400.4 eV), the typical bond of amino acids, in AD-FPMEC (Yu et al., 2018). The binding energies of 530.8, 532.0 and 532.7 eV were assigned to O–H (O1), P O/P–O (O3) and O–C (O4), respectively (Fig. 5C1 and C2) (Martı́Nez et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2012). Notably, the binding areas of O3 and P3 (C-O-PO3, 134.1 eV), assigned to the typical bonds in phospholipids, sharply dropped to 27.3% and 26.6% in AD-FPMEC, respectively. This result implied that the phospholipid bilayer of the cytomembrane was seriously damaged by co-pretreatment and further converted into inorganic phosphorus in the cascading conversion system (Rumble et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2018). This result could further be proven by the increase in P2 (133.6 eV) from ortho-P/pyro-P (Fig. 5D1 and D2) (de Carvalho Eufrásio Pinto et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). This result was also consistent with our previous study on the shifts in phosphorus speciation between sludge and supernatant (Zhou et al., 2019)."
12,Microbial community analysis,"3.5 Microbial community analysis A total of 34660-51218 effective reads were obtained from eight 16S rRNA gene libraries by Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Table S3). The alpha diversity indicated that pretreatment and cascading conversion significantly decreased the richness of the bacterial community and AD-FPMEC had the lowest richness (Table S3). To illustrate the interactions among all OTUs, three OTU networks were constructed (Fig. S6). In total, there were 1877 OTUs in the eight samples, of which only 385 (20.5%) OTUs were shared. For the prefermentative and bioelectrolytic groups, in each of the 4 samples, 744 (40.9%) and 508 (27.1%) OTUs were shared, respectively, but exhibited quite different compositions. The dominant phyla of the prefermentative group were Proteobacteria (37%), Bacteroidetes (12%) and Chloroflexi (10%), while those of the bioelectrolytic group were Proteobacteria (32%), Firmicutes (17%) and Bacteroidetes (16%). This result revealed the dissimilarity in the microbial communities participating in the two steps during cascading conversion. The bacterial structure and composition at the phylum and class levels are displayed in Fig. S6 C-D. Proteobacteria and Firmicute, typical anaerobic or bioelectrochemical communities (Bonmati et al., 2013; Cerrillo et al., 2016), were highly enriched during the bioelectrolysis step. Co-pretreatment led to a noticeable increase in Proteobacteria (62%) compared with that in AD-FMEC (50%) and AD-PMEC (51%). At the class level, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Clostiridia, which can convert soluble organics to VFAs (Kato et al., 2004), were clearly enriched in the prefermentative samples. Deltaproteobacteria, a reported representative anodic bacteria, increased to 43% in AD-FPMEC, a value much higher than that in AD-FMEC (15%) and AD-PMEC (31%). At the genus level (Fig. 6 A), representative anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB), consisting of Citrobacter (class Gammaproteobacteria), Macellibacteroides (class Bacteroidia) and two genera of class Clostridia (Proteiniclasticum and Sedimentibacter), were enriched after prefermentation and became the predominant bacteria in AD-FPWAS. Proteiniclasticum, responsible for the degradation of proteins to produce HAc, propionic acid (HPr) and iso-butyric acid (iso-HBu) (Zhou et al., 2018), had an abundance of 6.0% in AD-FPWAS. Macellibacteroides can metabolize various carbohydrates for HAc, HBu, and iso-HBu generation (Jabari et al., 2012); its proportion in AD-FWAS was 5.5%, and it was further enriched to 6.3% in AD-FPWAS. The genera Citrobacter and Sedimentibacter can degrade organics to produce VFAs and hydrogen during acidogenesis and acetogenesis (Imachi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018c) and displayed abundances of 5.7% and 6.9%, respectively, in AD-FPWAS, followed by AD-FWAS (1.4% and 5.7%) and AD-PWAS (0.3% and 1.3%). In addition, other fermentative genera, such as Terrimonas, Petrimonas, Anaerovorax and Rhodobacter (Grabowski et al., 2005; Kapdan et al., 2009; Matthies et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2012), were detected during prefermentation. The ultimate enrichment of AFB peaked in the prefermentative sample at 28.1% (AD-FPWAS), followed by 24.5% (AD-FWAS) and 16.1% (AD-PWAS) (Fig. 6B). Notably, Diaphorobacter and Thauera, the main nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) (Khardenavis et al., 2007; Yoshifumi et al., 2004) in AD-FWAS and AD-FPWAS, play important roles in nitrite removal, and their cumulative proportions reached 4.0% and 5.0%, respectively. The structure and abundance of key microbiomes were substantially changed during the bioelectrolysis step. Six kinds of EABs, including Geobacter, Pseudomonas, Desulfovibrio, Comamonas, Shewanella, and Acinetobacter, were enriched in the four bioanodic samples (Lovley, 2011). Two genera of class Deltaproteobacteria (Geobacter and Desulfovibrio), as well as Pseudomonas (class Gammaproteobacteria), represented the main EABs in AD-FPMEC. Geobacter had the highest accumulation of 39.0% in AD-FPMEC, followed by AD-PMEC (23.6%), AD-FMEC (9.2%) and AD-RMEC (3.3%). Pseudomonas and Desulfovibrio can conduct respiration by acting as a bioanode and biocathode (Lin et al., 2019) and were enriched to 13.6% and 3.8%, respectively, in AD-FPMEC. Ultimately, as shown in Fig. 6B, the total proportion of EAB reached 57.0% in AD-FPMEC, which was much higher than those obtained in AD-FMEC (31.3%) and AD-PMEC (42.1%). Additionally, two homo-acetogens, Acetobacterium and Acetoanaerobium, were promoted by electro-stimulation compared with the values detected in the prefermentation step. Although very little methane was detected in each group (Table S4), methanogens were still identified in the WAS samples. The composition and structure of archaea at the genus level are presented in Table S5. The overall abundance of archaea accounted for 0.02–1.18% in the eight sludge samples. Methanosaeta (acetotrophic methanogen) was the main methanogen in AD-RWAS (76%) and AD-FWAS (87.5%), whereas Methanobacterium (hydrogenotrophic methanogen) was the preponderant genus in AD-PWAS (63.6%) and AD-FPWAS (58.82%). In the bioelectrolysis step, the proportion of Methanosaeta decreased, and Methanocorpusculum appeared. Methanocorpusculum has also been reported to be a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen. Although the occurrence of hydrogenotrophic methanogen may lead to the loss of some hydrogen through methanogenesis (Liu et al., 2016), the influences exerted by the low abundance of archaeal sludge samples could be ignored."
13,CCA and MENs analysis of the key microbiome,"3.6 CCA and MENs analysis of the key microbiome The relationship between process variables and microbial populations was revealed by CCA analysis. VFAs and HAc showed positive correlations for axis 1 (representing 63.4% of the variance), while all the environmental variables, except methane production, were positively related to axis 2 (explaining 24.3% of the variance) (Fig. 6C). Detailed information is provided in Table S6. VFA production was closely correlated with soluble proteins and carbohydrates according to their small angles (<90°), implying that the hydrolysis process was the basis of acidification. The accumulation of soluble organics was mainly attributed to the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria. Furthermore, dominant acid-producing bacteria, such as Acinetobacter, Citrobacter and Sedimentibacter, gathered along the positive direction of axis 1 and contributed to VFA production. Two homo-acetogens, Acetobacterium and Acetoanaerobium, were closely related to hydrogen. Moreover, the current was strongly associated with hydrogen, which indicated the effective transfer of protons and electrons in the solution and at the electrodes. It was apparent that EABs, including Geobacter, Pseudomonas, Shewanella and Desulfovibrio, played vital roles in the generation of hydrogen and current. Methanocorpusculum is also related to hydrogen due to its function of converting hydrogen to methane. The overall MENs of the key microbiomes in the prefermentation and MEC steps are shown in Fig. S7. Based on the network size (OTU numbers) and total links of functional consortia, the network complexity of the MEC samples was higher than that of the prefermentative samples. Specifically, the MEC samples had a higher averaged connectivity (7.83), shorter averaged path distance (3.59) and less modularity (0.41) than the prefermentative samples (Table S7). To further explore the complex biological relationships (i.e., co-existence or competition) among the key microbiomes, two subnetworks were constructed (Fig. 7 ). Obvious positive correlations were observed among AFBs in the prefermentative samples (Fig. 7A). For example, Proteiniclasticum (OTU149) was positively related to Sedimentibacter (OTU60 and 39), Anaerovorax (OTU439) and Pseudomonas (OTU253). A positive correlation was also observed among Macellibacteroides (OTU579), Petrimonas (OTU15 and 19), Sedimentibacter (OTU39) and Bacteroides (OTU119). This result indicated similar symbiotic and underlying cooperative relationships between fermenters, which promoted hydrolysis and acidification. Regarding NRB, Diaphorobacter (OTU695), which can utilize various organics to accomplish denitrification, was positively related to Sedimentibacter (OTU147), Petrimonas (OTU15 and 19) and Macellibacteroides (OTU579). Nevertheless, Comamonas (OTU160), another NRB, was negatively correlated with several AFBs, including Macellibacteroides (OTU579 and 162), Citrobacter (OTU29), Bacteroides (OTU119) and Klebsiella (OTU28). This result indicated their potential competitive relationships. During the bioelectrolysis step, EAB, homo-acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were promoted. Geobacter (OTU24) showed a positive correlation with two AFBs, Rhodobacter (OTU326) and Lentimicrobium (OTU13 and 18). Pseudomonas (OTU4) was positively related to Proteiniclasticum (OTU909) and Desulfovibrio (OTU38). This result implied an analogical ecological niche or symbiosis between EAB and AFB, accelerating a “generation-consumption” pattern of organics to further promote electron transfer and hydrogen production. Desulfovibrio (OTU88) shared a negative relationship with Macellibacteroide (OTU30), Terrimonas (OTU780) and Sedimentibacter (OTU361), signifying a possible competing relationship. Regarding homo-acetogens, Acetobacterium (OTU25), displayed positive correlations with two AFBs, Proteiniclasticum (OTU909) and Macellibacteroides (OTU579), as well as the EAB Pseudomonas (OTU4), suggesting mutualistic symbiotic and cooperative interactions among homo-acetogens, AFB and EAB that enhanced the cascading utilization of organics through direct or indirect electron respiration from the electrode or intraspecies and interspecies electron transfer processes (Nagarajan et al., 2013). Regarding methanogens, Methanobacterium (OTU5 and 670) displayed positive correlations with Rhodobacter (OTU326) and Acinetobacter (OTU1810), respectively, suggesting potential niche division. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, including Methanocorpusculum (OTU9) and Methanobacterium (OTU22), may have an underlying syntrophic relationship with Geobacter (OTU10, 316 and 152). The same phenomenon was found for Methanobacterium (OTU144) and Desulfovibrio (OTU306), while these genera exhibited a negative relationship with Shewanella (OTU776), indicating niche separation among these genera. Additionally, some OTUs from the same genus (e.g., OTU258 and 909 from Proteiniclasticum and OTU780 and 860 from Terrimonas) exhibited opposite correlations with Acetobacterium (OTU300), indicating a possible exclusion mechanism or niche partitioning among versatile genera (Lin et al., 2019)."
14,Perspectives,"3.7 Perspectives With the development of city population and the increased quantity of treated wastewater, it will be keeping increasing on the amount of WAS production from WWTPs. However, safe disposal and efficient treatment of the WAS are still lacking for many plants (Lu et al., 2019). Energy consumption and resource recovery through anaerobic digestion will be fully characterised in a life-cycle assessment (Foley et al., 2010). The flows of chemical and energy input have to be considered to fulfil deep sludge utilization (Batstone et al., 2015). Considering the low hydrogen conversion from WAS due to the enmeshment of organics by EPS matrix and microbial cells, this work innovatively proposes the co-pretreatment of FNA and PAA for accelerating organics transformation from WAS to hydrogen in prefermentation-bioelectrolysis cascading system. Especially, the introduced PAA can assist with FNA to prompt EPS decomposition from WAS. The conceptual scheme of enhanced hydrogen recovery from cascading treatment of WAS accelerated by FNA + PAA co-pretreatment was illustrated in Fig. 8 . The co-pretreatment has the synergetic effect on EPS decomposition and organics release without any residuals (NO2 −-N, PAA or H2O2). FNA can be generated in situ as a byproduct from anaerobic digestion liquor (Law et al., 2015). Based on the price of PAA (12%, 1100–1200 €/t) (Luukkonen et al., 2015), 100 mg/g VSS would cost 9.2–10 €/m3 (assuming a VSS of 10 g/L) or 184–200 €/t dry solids (98% moisture content). As the pivotal WAS treatment process, prefermentation-electrolysis system shows the great superiority with the short treatment time (8 d), high hydrogen recovery (10.8 ± 0.3 mg H2/g VSS) and current density (6.3 A/m2) compared with sole AD or MEC process. Beegle et al. pointed out AD-MEC is more suitable for wastewater treatment than AD or MEC, on the premise of moderate capital cost, operation and maintenance and high revenue potential (Beegle and Borole, 2018). Although the application of MEC in large-scale is still facing some challenges (i.e., material costs and external energy input) (Wang et al., 2019c, 2020), various efforts have made to accomplish the process economically feasible. Escapa et al. estimated that MEC would be economically feasible under the current density of 5 A/m2 with the capital expense of 1220 €/m3-anode (Escapa et al., 2012). Aiken et al. proposed that the target current density of 2–3 A/m2 may accomplish break-even if reducing relative materials cost of 90% such as electrodes and current collector (Aiken et al., 2019). Based on the current density (6.3 A/m2) obtained in this study, the prefermentation-bioelectrolysis system would be economically feasible for the future implement, and can be further improved by several aspects, like employing cheaper cathode materials (e.g., stainless steel, nickel-or MoS2-based cathodes), upgrading the reactor scale and exploring cost-effective route for higher current density. Additionally, our previous study found that the cascading system is effective for organic phosphorus release; that is, a high content of N and P in the effluent could be further recovered as bio-fertilizer, e.g., struvite and vivianite, which could provide additional economic incentive (Zhou et al., 2019). Ultimately, lower disposal and transfer costs would be required for the handling of residual sludge due to the efficient degradation of WAS during the cascading system."
15,Conclusions,"This work offers an innovative approach for accelerating EPS decomposition and hydrogen recovery from WAS via PAA and FNA co-pretreatment in a prefermentation-MEC cascading system. The major conclusions include the following: (1) PAA, FNA and their intermediates, i.e., •NO, •NO2, N2O3, N2O4, ONOO−/ONOOH, •OH and •O2 −, contributed to effective EPS decomposition and WAS disintegration. (2) Co-pretreatment improved VFA accumulation (1.2- to 2.5-fold that of sole pretreatment) in the prefermentation step and the utilization of organics to produce hydrogen (1.4- to 1.7-fold that of sole pretreatment) in the bioelectrolysis step. (3) XPS analysis confirmed that co-pretreatment destroyed the phospholipid bilayer of the cytomembrane and accelerated the transformation from macromolecular organics to amide, carboxylate and carbonyl groups. (4) MiSeq sequencing showed that co-pretreatment stimulated the enrichment of AFB (28.1%) and EAB (57.0%) in the prefermentation and bioelectrolysis steps, respectively. (5) CCA and MENs revealed the intrinsic correlation between the functional microbiome and environmental factors as well as the interrelation among AFB, homo-acetogens, NRB, EAB and methanogens."
