0,Introduction,"The fast-growing demand of energy due to continuously increasing commercial industry, as well as the development has demanded for energy, all depends heavily on petroleum-based products, which are limited on one hand and the population and industrialization is increasing continuously and inserts extra pressure on additional energy demands. Petroleum based products are the main source of energy to these sectors such as fuels and lubricants. All these petroleum-based lubricants are toxic and non-renewable and are the major cause of environmental pollution [1]. One of the options is to develop more potential source which are renewable and alternative to those petroleum-based products. Bio-lubricants is one of the most important fields that offer simple, non-toxic, and renewable product that has the potential to be an alternative product in order to save environment and fulfill the demands of modern industry in order to reduce friction and wear for better movement of components that are in mutual contact with each other. Selection of proper lubricant can help to improve the lifespan of mechanical parts, utility, and the reliability of that machinery. Lubricants are used in all sectors of industry which requires machining operations either manually or automatic, either open system or closed system applications. Along with advantages of using lubricants, there is a disadvantage also, these lubricants lead to environmental pollution due to evaporation and spillage loss of lubricants per year also contribute to the pollution every year which is significant in amount that it cannot be neglected [2]. To overcome from these environmental losses, we must find some feasible solution of these lubricants which are bio-degradable, that do not harm the environment and can be obtained from renewable and sustainable sources. These bio-based lubricants can be obtained from animal fats, vegetable oils, etc. [3]. Along with this, they also should have proper lubricating property like high viscosity index, corrosion resistance, high oxidation stability etc. Triglyceride molecules is the basic composition of almost all the vegetable oils and have same molecular structure, glycerol and fatty acids are the main parts of triglyceride molecules [4]. The glycerol part is further consisted of hydroxyl group which are linked separately with carboxyl group of fatty acids. Saturated, unsaturated, and poly-saturated fatty acids are classified as natural fatty acids available in vegetable oils."
1,Lubricating oil compositions,"Lubricating oils are generally made of base-stocks with some additives to improve their properties. The addition of additives is base stocks since have some pre-defined properties like low viscosity index, oxidative stability which are not suitable for lubricating oils. Some of the base-stocks are as follows: • Mineral oil base-stocks: obtained from petroleum products during crude oil processing [5,6] • Re-refined oil base stocks: obtained from refined petroleum products by removing volatile and insoluble components [7] • Synthetic oil base stocks: can be achieved from petroleum oil by proper chemical modification. • Biomass base stocks: plants and animal source for the processing of bio-lubricants, while other sources include vegetable oils, and various other agro-residues [8–10]. Vegetable oils are effective for bio-lubricants due to its environment friendly nature, continuously increasing petroleum cost. Though it does not compete with the standards of petroleum-based lubricants, however its terms of pre-defined properties vegetable oils have high viscosity index, high flash point, high lubrication, and low evaporative losses [11]. Much research has shown that vegetable oil is an excellent agent to produce stable lubricants which can perform adequately as per the specifications and applications. Below are some common feed stocks of bio-lubricants: • Sunflower oil is obtained from the seeds of sunflower (Helianthus Annuus). The oil is mainly a triglyceride which is composed of palmitic acid (saturated), stearic acid (saturated), oleic acid (monounsaturated) and linoleic acid (polyunsaturated) [ref from notebook]. among these fatty acids, the high-oleic acid (82% oleic acid concentration) is found to be suitable for lubricant as it has a property like high oxidation stability and lubricity. Due to high level of unsaturated fats, the sunflower oil has high viscosity in cold temperatures [2]. • Castor oil is obtained from castor beans (Ricinus plant). Its triglyceride contains fatty acids chains (90%) as ricinoleate (ricinoleic acid). Due to its property like low temperature viscosity and high temperature lubricity, it is a perfect lubricant in jet, diesel and racing engines [12]. • Rapeseed oil (Brassica napus) is mainly cultivated for oil-rich seed (member family plant of mustard plant) which is rich in Erucic acid (54%). Rapeseed oil is preferred feed stock for biodiesel in most of Europe (80%) due to more oil per unit of land area compared to others vegetable oils. • Canola oil plant is a type of rapeseed plant having low eurcic acid but high nutritional value. • Jatropha oil is obtained from Jatropha Curcas plant. For last few years it has become the common plant for biodiesel production due to its high rate of seed production and ability to grow in almost every terrain. It is also used in formulating lubricants due to high content of fatty acid [13,14]. • Coconut oil (copra oil) has high levels of saturated fats which allow it to oxidize slowly. It can be treated as lubricant and transformer oil due to its derivatives like coconut fatty acid, also used as feedstock for biodiesel due to high viscosity. • Rice bran oil is obtained from rice husk, suitable for producing lubricant due to the fact that it has high smoke point and large share of oleic acid (38.4%) in its fatty acid composition. • Plam oil has high concentration of saturated fat (Palmitic acid), also it has monounsaturated oleic acid as a major constituent of palm oil which makes it suitable for the production of lubricant, it also has large amount of load carrying capacity [15]. Besides that, it has certain limitations like thermal and oxidative stability. • Soybean oil is the most widely used oil for cooking. Its fatty acid composition also contains large share of linoleic acid (51%) and monounsaturated oleic acid (23%). Transformer’s dielectric fluid has been tested successfully by soybean oil since it has the ability to rise the fire point and life of transformer by improving the life of insulating paper [2]."
2,Advantages and limitations,"It can be observed that the lubricants are the natural form of vegetable oil. Upon consideration for various industrial and other lubrication processes, vegetable oil as bio-lubricants has certain advantages or may have disadvantages depending upon the feedstock used to produce lubricants. The positive factor for using vegetable oil is that it has excellent lubricity, far superior to that of mineral oil. In fact, the lubricity of these vegetable oils is so potent that in some applications, such as tractor transmissions, friction materials must be added to reduce clutch slippage. Other considerations include viscosity index, which measures the fluid’s change of viscosity with temperature. In other word words, the oil with high viscosity index changes less with temperature than oil with low viscosity index. The viscosity index is also very high in vegetable oils [16]. A flash point is also considered to be an important property of vegetable oils, which is high as compared to mineral oils. Most importantly, vegetable oils are biodegradable, less toxic in nature and renewable source that reduce the dependency on imported petroleum oils [17]. Along with the advantages, the vegetable oils also have certain limitations such as low oxidative stability, many vegetable oils lack sufficient oxidative stability in their natural form for lubricant use. The use of antioxidants can be used to overcome this limitation, but with this chemical modification will result in shifting of its fatty acids due to partial hydrogenation process and also increase the cost of the final product. With the recent development in biotechnology have promoted the improvement of genetically enhanced oil seeds that are naturally stable and do not require chemical modification and additionally utilization of antioxidants. The level of oxygen consumption or carbon-dioxide advancement is observed to examine the degree of biodegradability. Most vegetable oils have appeared to biodegrade in excess of 70% within that period, when contrasted with petroleum oils biodegrading at nearly 15 to 35 percent. For a test to be considered promptly biodegradable there should be more than 60-percent degradation in 28 days. Similarly, by utilizing an assortment of tests involving fish, daphnia and other organisms, the toxicity of vegetable oils can be estimated. In this case, both mineral oil and vegetable oil in their unadulterated structures show little toxicity, but when additives are included, the toxicity increments. Another factor to be considered is their high pour point. By the method of winterization, the use of chemical additives can address the problem and helps to lower the pour point. Different synthetic oils can be utilized for this purpose. If a high degree of biodegradability is required, at that point biodegradable synthetic esters are added to improve cold-temperature properties. Then again, if the objective is to keep the supposed bio-based property, where at least 51 percent of the lubricant is made of natural biomaterials, some blend portion might be light mineral oil with low pour points. The latter will show a higher degree of toxicity and a lower degree of biodegradability."
3,Chemical modification process,"Vegetable oils generally have unsaturated fatty acids which results in unstable thermal properties and poor oxidation properties makes it to react easily with oxygen in air, hence, make the properties not suitable for application as lubricating oils. With the help of chemical modification process such as transesterification, epoxidation, and hydrogenation as shown in Fig. 1 , the unsaturated fatty acids are being reduced to make the vegetable oils feasible to use in engines and make it comparable to conventional lubricants. These processes make the lubricants more chemically stable for a wide range of applications [18] with better frictional and wear properties."
4,Transesterification process,"4.1 Transesterification process The Transesterification of vegetable oils, animal fats or waste bio-degradable products is the process behind conventional biodiesel. In the Transesterification process a glyceride reacts with an alcohol (typically methanol) in the presence of a catalyst forming fatty acid, alkyl esters and an alcohol. The feedstock for transesterification can be any fatty acids from vegetable or animal origin or used cooking oils (UCO). Typically used vegetable oils originate from rapeseed [79,131], sunflower, olive [79] soybean [126,127], canola [87], oil palms [112,115], all Ref. from [5] and jatropha [18,23,67,68] from [1]. TMP and NPG are the polyols that is used for the production bio-lubricants by chemical modification of vegetable oils. The fatty acid methyl esters are obtained from the triglyceride of these vegetable oils [19]. The transesterification of oil palm and palm kernel oil [27,19] from 1 using TMP were studied [27] and further developed the optimum synthesis method of oil palm [19] to from the bio-lubricant. Further characterization of palm kernel oil [31 from 1] were also investigated by transesterification with TMP and sodium methoxide as catalyst and the result showed that the palm kernel oil as a feedstock is in good agreement for the production of bio-lubricant for which the viscosity index is in the range of 167–187 and pour point of −1 °C to 1 °C. When canola biodiesel [87 from 5] was used for the production of bio-lubricant by using TMP transesterification and sodium methoxide as a catalyst, it showed considerable results with low temperature properties like pour point of −51 °C to −66 °C. The characterization of jatropha oil TMP esters (bio-lubricant) was studied [ref paper [2]] and the following properties were obtained: the viscosity was 51.89 cSt at 40 °C, pour point as −3 °C, flash point was found to be 296 °C, while the viscosity index was 140. Depending on the origin of the oils and fats some pretreatment is necessary before processing. • In any case water is removed as it causes the triglycerides to hydrolyze during base-catalyzed transesterification, producing soap stock instead of biodiesel • Virgin oils are refined, but not to food grade level • In some cases, the removal of phospholipids and other plant matter is done by degumming • Recycled oils as UCO are purged from impurities such as dirt or charred Food"
5,Hydrogenation,"4.2 Hydrogenation Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen and different compounds. Hydrogenation is utilized in numerous applications, for example, the food business, petrochemical industry, and the drug producing industry. The reaction is generally in the presence of catalyst. The response might be one in which hydrogen essentially adds to a double or triple bond interfacing two atoms in the structure of the molecule or one in which the addition of hydrogen brings about dissociation (separating) of the molecules (called hydrogenolysis, or destructive hydrogenation). The catalyst most generally utilized for hydrogenation reactions are the metals nickel, platinum and palladium and their oxides. For high-pressure hydrogenations, copper chromite and nickel supported on kieselguhr (free or permeable diatomite) are widely utilized. For the processing of vegetable oils, the reaction involves various chemical reactions such as double bond saturation, geometric isomerization, and positional isomerization [2]. The double bond present in the oils along with the isomerization of fatty acids greatly influenced its physical properties and the quality. Many industrial processes are conducted in the presence of Raney Ni catalyst having pressure ranges from 69 kPa to around 413 kPa whereas the temperature goes from 150 to 225 °C [20]. However, Ni has some toxicity problem which has raised the concern to develop new catalyst. Palladium was the result of the research due to its high catalytic activity when compared with Nickel. To prevent the decay of pour-point of the lubricant partial hydrogenation is required which is why catalyst selectivity is important as it helps to reduce linolenic acid and it helps the catalyst to reduce by hydrogenation to form monenes, without being reduced to full saturation. In a study where ethyl esters of sunflower oil have gone through selective hydrogenation in presence of Pd, Ru and Pt as a catalyst. It has been observed that the performance of Pd catalyst was better than other two catalysts and has improved selectivity of n-cis C18:1 ester due to the presence of copper and lead in palladium catalyst. The oleic acid had also found to be table in the atmosphere of oxygen, which makes it to maintain liquid form even at low temperatures [2]. Upon using different oxides such as silicon oxide, copper oxide, aluminum oxide, cannot affect the selectivity of cis C18:1 in palladium. Research have been done to improve the stability of oxidation through partial hydrogenation using catalyst as oxides of aluminum or palladium."
6,Epoxidation,"4.3 Epoxidation The production of bio-lubricants through the process of epoxidation of vegetable oil is another method in which double bond of peroxy acid reacts to form vegetable oils and with removal of carbon = carbon bonds. It has become popular due to modification of double carbon bond which has improved the range of reactions. In a study where rapeseed oil was formed by conventional epoxidation method which uses acid ion exchange resins, the metal catalyst, and the enzymes [21] . The result concluded that the obtained oil has improved oxidation stability in presence of antioxidants, has better properties to reduce friction and can resist large pressure when compared to rapeseed oil. It is due to the fact that the polyether film was formed by tribo-polymerization. When epoxidation of soyabean oil was studied in which sulphuric acid was used as the catalyst and the reaction was done using different branched alcohols [22] . Former esterification was achieved which has resulted into hydroxyl group with acid anhydride. It was observed that the oxidation stability has improved with reduction in pour point due to branching. A bio-lubricant was obtained in a single reaction using esterification of epoxidized canola oil and epoxy ring-opening process by using novel sulphate Ti-SBA-15 catalyst as acetic anhydride. Encouraging result has obtained which has better tribological characteristics for bio-lubricant [11] . Upon epoxidation of vegetable oils through cationic ion-exchange resins and of rapeseed oil, the pour point of rapeseed oil reduced to −150C when compared with raw form of rapeseed oil. Furthermore, the potential responses during the epoxy ring-opening lead to huge number of fascinating items for bio-lubricants."
7,Conclusions and recommendations,"The brief literature review has been discussed about the information related to bio-based lubricants with related properties of raw materials used as feed stock. These feed stock includes various vegetable oils with their properties such as viscosity, pour point, oxidation stability, operating temperature as well as operating parameters were also discussed. In order to improve the properties of the lubricating oils various chemical modification processes which includes transesterification, hydrogenation and epoxidation is under consideration. This review provides the general overview of different vegetable oils that can be used to processes the bio-based lubricants and the key parameters to characterize the properties that are feasible for its applications. Due to eco-friendly nature and biodegradable characteristics, these vegetable oils are found to be effective over conventional oils. It is also observed that due to high unsaturated fatty acids, these vegetable oils do not have suitable lubricating properties such as oxidation and thermal instability, viscosity. To overcome this, various chemical modification processes can be used in order to improve the properties and make them significant and promising alternative over conventional lubricants."
