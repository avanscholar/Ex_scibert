0,Introduction,"Liquid electrolytes have been widely used in the manufacturing of electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries for decades due to their promising high ionic conductivity. However, liquid electrolytes have several drawbacks such as the formation of lithium dendrites, leakage of corrosive liquid or toxic gases, inflexibility and difficulty in handling of liquid electrolytes [1,2]. Therefore, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been invented and synthesised to replace liquid electrolytes as they have superior thermal and chemical stabilities that can withstand decomposition at high temperatures. Besides, SPEs are chosen because of their attractive properties such as chemically inert behavior, high flexibility, free from corrosive flammable liquids and elimination of dendrites formation to improve the cycle life and safety performances of the electrochemical devices [3]. Environmental issues such as the depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels, production of enormous waste and air pollution contributed by toxic organic solvents become highlights in recent years. Therefore, the utilization of environmentally friendly polymer electrolyte is encouraged to overcome the environmental issues. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is chosen as the host polymer as it has properties such as non-toxic, hydrophilic and biodegradable. Besides, PVA can be dissolved in distilled water and tend to form transparent films with superior mechanical and tensile strength and is resistant towards organic solvent vapor. The presence of simple structure polyhydroxy pendant groups provides a site of attachment to the charged species for ionic conduction to take place and enhances the flexibility of the polymer backbone which contributes to greater conductivity due to the enhanced ionic mobility by rapid polymer segmental motions [4,5]. The superior flexibility and adhesive properties of PVA film reduces the interfacial resistance due to excellent contact between electrolyte and electrodes, which makes it as a good candidate for the application in electrochemical devices. Lithium cations (Li+) is commonly used in electrochemical devices as they have high ion mobility due to low steric hindrance. High ion movement in the electrolytes enables them to penetrate the electrode sheet more profoundly and homogenously during charge transfer process [6]. Therefore, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf) is used to provide the charge carriers in this research. LiTf is selected as it has low lattice energy of ~ 725 kJmol−1 and large size of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (CF3SO3 −). Owing to the low lattice energy of LiTf, the ions can be dissociated easily. As a result, the negative charge on the triflate anion is delocalised over the sulfonate group, and this acts as a greater source of charge carriers available for ionic conduction [7]. Nevertheless, polymer-salt systems exhibit relatively low ionic conductivity which is not applicable in any electrochemical devices. Thus, the ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr), is added to the polymer electrolyte system to enhance the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte by contributing to greater number of mobile ions through dissociation in the presence of plasticising effect [8,9]. IL is a type of molten salt comprising of a bulky and asymmetric organic cation and a highly delocalized–charge inorganic anion whereby its melting temperatures is below 100 ℃. BmImBr was chosen in this work mainly due to its appealing properties such as high dielectric constant, high diffusivity and extremely low glass transition temperature (T g) (which is –48 °C) [10,11]. Owing to these advantages, addition of BmImBr can soften the polymer backbone and promote ion diffusion in the electrolyte by enhancing the ion separation and inhibiting the ion agglomeration. SPEs have been widely used in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, chemical sensors, supercapacitors and solar cells. The depletion of fossil fuel and ever-growing world population has drawn the attention to develop the alternative renewable energy resources such as supercapacitors, batteries and solar cells as they are energy efficient and environmentally friendly [12,13]. Supercapacitor stores potential energy electrostatically and allows a rapid exchange between charging and discharging cycles. It offers higher energy density than the conventional dielectric capacitors and higher power density than batteries. Supercapacitor can be classified into three categories that are electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors. EDLC is chosen as it involves non-Faradaic mechanism. EDLC shows several advantages such as excellent cycling stability, higher power density than batteries, good thermal stability, superior safety performance and easy for fabrication [14]. The aim of this work is to synthesise BmImBr-incorporated SPEs and study the effect of different concentrations of BmImBr on the electrical, structural and electrochemical properties of the SPEs. The most conducting SPE is then used in the fabrication of EDLC using two identical carbon-based electrodes and its electrochemical properties are eventually measured. The highlight of this work is the quantitative analysis of Fourier Transform Infrared studies. The quantitative analysis is carried out by conducting the deconvolution and peak fitting on a wide band which consists of a few of overlapping peaks using mathematical method. Quantitative analysis is critical in this research to obtain the microscopic view of the material. Addition of BmImBr demonstrated magnificent increments on ionic conductivities in previous works done by our peers with different types of salts and polymers [15–17]. In spite of that, up to date, there is still no research reported on the performance of EDLC fabricated with PVA-LiTf-BmImBr electrolyte and two carbon-based electrodes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr) were used to synthesise the solid polymer electrolytes. PVA (99%, Chemiz) and LiTf (Sigma-Aldrich, purity > 99.5%), were used as host polymer and conducting ionic salt, respectively. Ionic liquid, BmImBr with molecular weight of 219.13 g mol−1 was obtained from Merck, Germany. Activated carbon, carbon black, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF) with the molecular weight of 534000 g mol−1 were used to prepare the electrodes. Activated carbon with its particle size of 5 ~ 20 µm and surface area of 1800 ~ 2000 m2 g−1, from Kuraray Chemical Co Ltd., Japan, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from Sigma-Aldrich, Malaysia, carbon black from AME Energy Co., China and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with purity ≥ 99.5% from Merck, Germany were used for preparation of electrodes. All the materials listed were used as received."
3,Polymer electrolytes preparation,"2.2 Polymer electrolytes preparation A series of solid polymer electrolytes which comprise of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr) in different ratios were prepared using solution casting method. A series of polymer electrolytes were prepared with a fixed weight ratio of poly (vinyl alcohol) to lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate as 60:40 and different weight fraction of BmImBr, as illustrated in Table 1 . Poly (vinyl alcohol) solution was first prepared by dissolving in distilled water and stirring at 70 °C until the polymer was fully dissolved. Lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr) were then added into the dissolved polymer solution and stirred for 24 h at room temperature to form a homogenized solution. The prepared polymer electrolyte solution was then casted on a petri dish. The solution was then allowed to dry overnight in oven at 70 °C. A free-standing polymer electrolyte film was eventually obtained."
4,Characterization of polymer electrolytes,"2.3 Characterization of polymer electrolytes The prepared polymer electrolytes were characterized using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Attenuated Total Reflectance - Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis and Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) analysis to study the electrical, thermal, structural and electrochemical properties, respectively. 2.3.1 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) The average thickness of each freshly prepared polymer electrolyte was first measured using micrometer screw gauge prior to EIS measurement. The polymer electrolytes were then subjected to alternating current EIS for determination of ionic conductivity at which the polymer electrolyte was sandwiched between two stainless steel blocking electrodes. The impedance of polymer electrolyte films was measured using the LCR HiTESTER impedance analyser (IM 3538 HIOKI, Japan) over a wide frequency range from 50 Hz to 8 MHz from ambient temperature to 110 °C. The ionic conductivity of each solid polymer electrolyte was determined using the following equation: (1) σ = l R b A where σ represents the ionic conductivity (S cm−1), l is the thickness of polymer film (cm), Rb stands for bulk resistance of polymer electrolytes (Ω). The Rb was determined from the Nyquist plot and A is the surface area of the stainless steel-blocking electrode (cm2). 2.3.2 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) The TA instrument DSC Q20 was used to perform DSC analysis for the polymer electrolytes under nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 60 mL min−1. Samples weighing of approximately 5 mg was loaded into a platinum Tzero pan and another empty platinum pan were hermetically sealed as sample pan and reference cell, respectively. The samples were heated from 25 °C to 105 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to remove any trace amount of water and moisture as an initial step and the heating process was maintained at 105 °C for 5 min to ensure complete removal of water and this marked the end of the first cycle. The second cycle involved the cooling of the heated sample to 25 °C at a cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 and then heated to 200 °C to equilibrate the sample. The heated sample was then cooled to −100 °C at the pre-set cooling rate and this marked the end of cycle 3. The samples were then reheated to 200 °C at the same heating rate. The glass transition temperature (T g) of polymer electrolytes were evaluated using third cycle with the TA Universal Analysis 2000 software. 2.3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermal properties such as thermal stability and thermal decomposition of polymer electrolytes were evaluated by using TA Instrument Q50 and analysed with TA Universal Analysis 2000 software. Sample weighing of approximately 10 mg was placed onto a platinum pan and heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 60 mL min−1. 2.3.4 Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transformed infrared studies Perkin Elmer FTIR Spectrum 100 spectrometer equipped with an ATR internal reflection system was used to carry out FTIR study on polymer electrolytes. The FTIR spectra were recorded with 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1 in transmittance mode over the wavenumber range from 4000 cm−1 to 650 cm−1 at room temperature. OMNIC 8 software was used to examine the FTIR spectra and peak deconvolution. The peak deconvolution process was carried out by implementing the peak fitting method using a mathematical way. The FTIR curve was fitted with gaussian–lorentzian mixed function. 2.3.5 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) Potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT101) analyser was employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties such as the potential window of polymer electrolytes. These polymer electrolytes were analysed at a scan rate of 0.01 mVs−1 by placing the polymer electrolyte between stainless steel electrodes in the potential range of ± 3 V."
5,Preparation of electrode,"2.4 Preparation of electrode The first step of electrode preparation involved the preparation of carbon slurry which is composed of 80 wt% of activated carbon, 5 wt% of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 5 wt% of carbon black and 10 wt% of poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) which acts as a binder and N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent. 10 wt% of PVDF was initially dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent and heated at 60 °C with continuous stirring until a clear solution was obtained. 5 wt% of multi-walled carbon nanotubes, 5 wt% of carbon black and 80 wt% of activated carbon were then added into the solution to form carbon slurry. The solution was then heated at 60 °C and stirred continuously for a few hours, followed by further stirring at room temperature. Carbon slurry with smooth and homogenous features was eventually produced. Two identical aluminium current collectors were coated evenly with carbon slurry dried in an oven set at 70 °C."
6,Fabrication of EDLC,"2.5 Fabrication of EDLC For EDLC fabrication, two identical cells were assembled with the most conducting polymer electrolyte and the ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte. EDLC was fabricated by sandwiching the polymer electrolyte between two activated carbon-based electrodes. The cell was pressed with a hydraulic press at 3 US tons to ensure better interfacial contact between the electrodes and electrolyte. The assembled EDLC cell was then placed in a sample holder for further electrochemical analysis."
7,Characterization of EDLC cell,"2.6 Characterization of EDLC cell The fabricated cells were characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) analyses to investigate their electrochemical properties such as the specific capacitance of assembled EDLC. 2.6.1 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) Potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT101) analyser equipped with Nova 2.1 software was used to determine the specific capacitance at a scan rate of 0.01 Vs−1 in the potential range between 0 and 1 V. The specific capacitance (C sp) of EDLC was determined by employing the following equations: (2) C s P = i sm F g - 1 (3) C s P = i sA F c m - 2 where i represents the average anodic–cathodic current (A), s indicates the potential scan rate (V s−1), m is the average mass of active materials and A is the surface area of the carbon electrodes [15]. 2.6.2 Galvanostatic charge–discharge performance (GCD) Potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT101) was used to carry out GCD study of EDLC. The EDLC was charged and discharged at 0.25 mA. The cell was first allowed to rest for 5 s prior to the measurement. The specific discharge capacitance (Csp) was obtained from charge–discharge curves, according to following formula: (4) C s P = i m dv / d t where i is the applied current (A), m represents the average mass of electrode materials, dV is the potential change of a discharging process in which the internal resistance drop occurring at the beginning of the cell discharge is excluded and dt is the discharging process time interval. The dv / d t can be obtained from the gradient of the charge–discharge curve [15]. Energy density (E, W h kg−1) and power density (P, W kg−1) were determined by using the follow equations [15]: (5) E = C S P × ( d V ) 2 2 × 1000 3600 (6) P = I × d V 2 × m × 1000"
8,Results and discussion,
9,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),"3.1 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) 3.1.1 Ambient temperature – Ionic conductivity study Fig. 1 illustrates the logarithm of ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes with the various mass ratio of BmImBr. As shown in Fig. 1, the incorporation of BmImBr into polymer-salt electrolyte system increases the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes significantly. The more weight percentage of BmImBr added into the polymer electrolyte, the higher the ionic conductivity is. Based on Fig. 1, the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolyte has been increased by approximate two orders of magnitude from (9.73 ± 0.04) × 10−6 S cm−1 to (1.96 ± 0.01) × 10−4 S cm−1 with addition of 50 wt% of BmImBr at room temperature. Apart from ionic mobility, the flexibility of polymeric backbone also plays a vital role in governing the ionic conductivity [18]. Hence, the increase of ionic conductivity with respect to the concentration of BmImBr is mainly due to the plasticizing effect of ionic liquids since plasticizing effect on BmImBr increases the flexibility of the polymer backbones and thus initiates the segmental motion of polymer chains. Therefore, the increase in flexibility and segmental motion of polymer chains improves the frequency of ion hopping process within the polymer chains. Moreover, BmImBr is a high dielectric constant ionic liquid [16]. Therefore, BmImBr can prevent the formation of ion pairs and ion aggregation of lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf) effectively due to its solvating power [19]. In addition, the low viscosity of BmImBr aids in enhancing the efficiency of ion transportation along the less entangled polymer chains [9]. Apart from that, more mobile ions are produced when BmImBr is dissociated into its ions which are BmIm+ and Br− during the dissolution process. The segregation of LiTf and dissociation of BmImBr contributes to the large number of charge carriers which are available for transportation and thus enhances the ionic conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of the most conducting polymer electrolyte obtained from this research is higher than the previous researches. Ma and co-workers prepared electrolytes consisting of imidazolium-based polymerized ionic liquid as polymer matrix and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The composite electrolyte with addition of 2.0 mol/kg of LiTFSI achieved its ionic conductivity of is 7.78 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C [20]. Another polymerized ionic liquid-based composite electrolyte containing poly(diallyldimethylammonium)TFSI, LiTFSI and pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide achieved the maximum ionic conductivity of 1.60 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 20 °C [21]. PVA/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) − based blend electrolytes consisting of lithium bis(trifluoromethansulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) and ionic liquid, 1 − butyl − 1 − methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYRTFSI) were prepared by Thayumanasundaram et al. [22]. A maximum ionic conductivity of 1.00 × 10−4 S cm−1 is observed at 25 °C in the membrane with 70 mol% ionic liquids [22]. Moreover, Kumar and co-workers synthesized a polymer electrolyte based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoroprolylene) (PVdF-HFP)/LiTf. The polymer electrolyte achieved a considerably high ionic conductivity of 1.64 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature which is comparable to the PVA-based polymer electrolyte reported in this current work [23]. The most conducting PSI 5 is a suitable SPE for EDLC fabrication as the ionic conductivity lies within the range of 10−4 S cm−1 which is applicable in practical applications. 3.1.2 Temperature dependent-ionic conductivity study The polymer electrolytes are subjected to temperature dependent–ionic conductivity analysis to study the effect of temperature on the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes and to investigate the ionic conduction mechanism in the electrolytes. The polymer electrolytes are fitted with Arrhenius theory to verify the ion transportation mechanism in the electrolyte. The Arrhenius equation is expressed as follows: (5) σ = A exp - E a k B T where σ is the ionic conductivity (S cm−1), A represents a constant that is proportional to the number of charge carriers (S cm−1), Ea is activation energy (eV), k B is defined as Boltzmann constant (8.6173 × 10−5eV K−1) and T is the absolute temperature (K). The Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of ionic conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes of PSI 0, PSI 4 and PSI 5 as a function of absolute temperature from 25 °C to 110 °C is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes increases with fraction of ionic liquids, as shown in Section 3.1.1. Similarly, the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes is in the order of PSI 5 > PSI 4 > PSI 0 from 25 °C to 110 °C. Since the regression values of the Arrhenius plot for all polymer electrolyte samples were close to unity, it can be concluded that charge carriers of polymer electrolytes exhibit the hopping process for conduction [4]. Arrhenius theory states that the ion transportation in the electrolyte is based on thermally-activated principle. The ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes increases with temperature for all polymer electrolytes. According to Arrhenius theory, the ion hopping mechanism is similar to that of ionic crystal occurs at where the free ions will jump from an occupied site to the neighbouring vacant site [16]. The plasticizing effect of ionic liquids on the polymer backbone of PVA enhances the flexibility of polymer chains. We postulate a mechanism of the ion transport in the polymer electrolytes as depicted in Fig. 3 . The charge carriers in the polymer electrolytes are initially dissociated upon dissolution. The dissociated charge carriers would form a weak coordination bond with the oxygen from hydroxyl group of flexible PVA chains. The charge carriers would thus be dissociated from this weak bond and hop to a neighbouring empty site via diffusion along the chains as illustrated in Fig. 3. There is another possibility of the ion transport from a polymer chain to another chain. Besides, a greater energy is supplied to the polymer chains to overcome the energy barrier at elevated temperature. This results in a higher frequency of bond rotation and vibration of polymer backbone and leads to more favourable ion hopping at inter- and intra-chains. Therefore, higher ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes is observed as temperature increases [4]. Moreover, the conducting ions possess greater kinetic energy at higher temperature, which enables them to hop to neighbouring vacant sites easily [16]. Activation energy is defined as the minimum amount of energy required for an ion to break the transient dipole–dipole interaction between the polar groups of the polymer backbone. The activation energy of polymer electrolytes is in the order of PSI 0 (312.72 meV) > PSI 4 (106.93 meV) > PSI 5 (17.48 meV). The results are in good accordance with the findings in section 3.1.1. This further proves that the presence of ionic liquid reduces the activation energy significantly. The drastic decrease in activation energy allows ions to conduct electricity at a lower energy, therefore the ionic liquid-added polymer electrolytes generally show higher ionic conductivity at all temperatures compared to that of ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte."
10,Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),"3.2 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) Differential scanning calorimetry was used to identify the glass transition temperature of the polymer electrolytes. Fig. 4 shows the DSC thermograms of PSI 0, PSI 4 and PSI 5. From Fig. 4, it can be observed that the glass transition temperature (T g) of polymer electrolytes decreases steadily from 81.09 °C (ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte, PSI 0) to 65.30 °C with addition of 40 wt% BmImBr (PSI 4). The T g decreases significantly upon the addition of 50 wt% BmImBr to 13.65 °C. As aforementioned, the significant decrease in T g of polymer electrolyte in the presence of ionic liquid indicates the plasticizing effect of BmImBr. The flexibility of polymer chains in amorphous region increases as the T g decreases. Therefore, the flexible polymer chains can aid in better ionic mobility. Glass transition temperature is the temperature at which the polymer changes from a glassy state to a rubbery state in amorphous region at which segmental motion of polymer chain starts to occur. Therefore, T g is critical for the conductivity of polymer electrolytes through coupled-motion, as the segmental motion of polymer segments helps in the hopping mechanism of mobile charge carriers via intra- and interchain hopping mechanism [24]. The plasticising effect of BmImBr results in the softening of polymer backbone and thus leads to an increase in flexibility of the polymer complex. The 50 wt% BmImBr-added polymer electrolyte (PSI 5) has the lowest T g at 13.65 °C showing that the polymer chains in polymer electrolyte has an extremely high flexibility. Therefore, the ionic transportation is most favourable in PSI 5, thus contributing to the highest ionic conductivity at room temperature compared to other polymer electrolytes."
11,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermal stability and the percentage of weight loss of polymer electrolytes are determined by using thermogravimetric analysis. Polymer electrolyte with good thermal stability is an important property for the electrolyte to be able to withstand harsh environments such as high temperature without changing its functions. The thermogram is used to identify the decomposition temperature of the polymer electrolytes. Fig. 5 illustrate the TGA curves for PSI 0, PSI 4 and PSI 5. The onset and offset temperatures for the first weight loss for all polymer electrolytes are similar as demonstrated in Fig. 5. The weight loss of 14.99%, 15.81% and 16.35% was attained from 81.25 °C to 100 °C for PSI 0, PSI 4 and PSI 5, respectively. This proves that the first weight loss in polymer electrolytes is due to the loss of water or moisture that is trapped or absorbed in the polymer matrices as polymers are hygroscopic compounds. A rapid decrease in weight was observed consecutively within the temperature regime from 230 °C to 322 °C. The second decomposition results in a weight loss of 26.06%, 18.80% and 18.84% for PSI 0, PSI 4 and PSI 5, respectively. This decomposition stage is related to the degradation of PVA involving the removal of hydroxyl substituents from the polymer chains and also thermal degradation of some volatile compounds. This elimination of hydroxyl substituent groups leads to the formation of high molecular weight conjugated polyenes and ether linkage by chain stripping mechanism [16,25]. Besides, the chain scission on the polymer backbone also results in the formation of carbonyl compounds such as ketones and aldehydes [26]. From the TGA thermogram, an extra degradation step can also be observed for PSI 4 and PSI 5 at 334.38 °C and 340.00 °C, respectively. PSI 4 starts to degrade from 310 °C to 370 °C with a weight loss of 25.32%. On the other hand, PSI 5 exhibits its decomposition at higher temperature range from 322 °C to 403 °C with a mass loss of 32.79%. This peak reveals the thermal degradation of BmImBr in polymer electrolytes as the degradation of this stage is absent for PSI 0 and higher mass loss is obtained for PSI 5 (which has higher mass fraction of ionic liquids). Pristine BmImBr degrades at 258 °C, however higher degradation temperature is attained at this stage of decomposition upon incorporation of ionic liquid in the polymer matrix. This is suggestive of formation of coordinative bonds in the polymer electrolyte when the IL interacts with the hydroxyl substituents of the polymer chains [16]. A rapid thermal decomposition is observed thereafter. This final stage of weight loss indicates the subsequent degradation of PVA chains and the thermal degradation of ionic salt, LiTf which is occurred at approximately 450 °C. This is supported by the following weight loss observed for all polymer electrolytes. As can be seen, PSI 0 manifests a weight loss of 39.49% at 456 °C. On the contrary, PSI 4 and PSI 5 decompose at 437 °C and 460 °C with its weight loss of 27.14% and 22.60%, respectively. Lower weight loss has been observed for ionic liquid-added polymer electrolytes compared to the ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte. This is ascribed to lower amount of polymer and salt used in the preparation of ionic liquid-added polymer electrolytes. The second stage of degradation of PVA chains involves the random chain-scission which is also known as carbonation of high molecular weight conjugated polyenes, which is formed from the first degradation stage of PVA to low molecular weight polyenes. A plateau region of TGA curves beyond the final thermal decomposition indicates that the complete degradation of polymer electrolytes."
12,Attenuated total reflectance − Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR − FTIR),"3.4 Attenuated total reflectance − Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR − FTIR) The structural information of polymer electrolytes was studied using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Besides, the interaction between polymer-salt and the effect of adding BmImBr into the polymer electrolytes can be obtained from the FTIR spectra. Fig. 6 illustrates the FTIR spectra of pure PVA, pure LiTf, pure BmImBr, PSI 0 and PSI 5. Furthermore, the vibrational modes of each spectrum are summarized in Table 2 . The addition of LiTf to PVA host polymer has led to the formation of several new peaks which are contributed by the functional groups of LiTf. The most significant peaks are characteristic peaks of LiTf at 1639 cm−1 and 3445 cm−1 for PSI 0 [27]. The presence of this characteristic peak in spectrum of PSI 0 indicates successful complexation between the PVA and LiTf. Moreover, a few peaks from both LiTf and PVA are disappeared when the salt was added into the polymer solution. The stretching mode of CF3 of LiTf located at 1250 cm−1 is absent in PSI 0. Moreover, the peak originated from SO3 stretching mode at 1291 cm−1 is disappeared in both PSI 0 and PSI 5. The disappearance of these peaks in the spectra indicates that the LiTf salt is complexed successfully with the polymer host. Besides, the peak designated as CH3 in-plane deformation at 1326.48 cm−1 is disappeared for both PSI 0 and PSI 5. The ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte also exhibits the upward and downward shifts in term of wavenumber when LiTf was incorporated in the polymer matrix, whereby most of the PVA peaks experience an upward shift. These peaks include OH bending mode which is shifted from 941 cm−1 to 952 cm−1 and CO stretching mode which is shifted from 1082 cm−1 to 1094 cm−1. Besides, the peaks contributed by the polymer backbone such as CH2 wagging mode, CH deformation mode and CH stretching mode appear at slightly higher wavenumber in the presence of conducting salt. On the other hand, majority of the LiTf peaks tend to shift to lower wavenumber for PSI 0. The CF3 substituent group peaks corresponding to the CF3 in-plane deformation and -CF3 group stretching modes shift from 776 cm−1 to 761 cm−1 and from 1185 cm−1 to 1167 cm−1, respectively. These changes in the wavenumber of peaks show that there is an interaction between LiTf salt and PVA. Six new peaks are observed upon the inclusion of BmImBr into polymer-salt system. This is suggestive of the presence of BmImBr functional groups. The characteristic peaks are CH bending of imidazole (BmIm+) at 755 cm−1, a strong peak of imidazole HCC & HCN bending mode at 1164 cm−1, CN stretching at 1568 cm−1, CH stretching of methyl group in alkyl substituent which appear as shoulder peaks at 2864 cm−1 and 2912 cm−1 and = CH stretching mode of BmImBr at 3105 cm−1 [27]. The shifting of peaks for CN stretching mode of BmImBr from 1562 cm−1 to 1568 cm−1 and CH stretching of methyl group in alkyl chains from 2962 cm−1 to 2912 cm−1, is due to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymer and BmImBr [27]. The shifts of these peaks prove the complexation of ionic liquid with polymer matrix. Some of the characteristic peaks of BmImBr are not observed in PSI 5 when BmImBr is complexed in polymer electrolyte. The main absorption band of BmImBr at 657 cm−1 which is designated as C-Br stretching mode of BmImBr is absent in PSI 5. This indicates that the ionic liquid had dissociated into its free ions, BmIm+ and Br – [16]. Besides, the other peaks that are not found in PSI 5 including the in-plane CH bending and CN stretching mode of imidazole ring at 888 cm−1 and 1271 cm−1, CH wagging mode at 1008 cm−1 and symmetrical CH2 bending mode at 1329 cm−1. Moreover, the small peak of asymmetrical and sharp peak of symmetrical bending mode of CH3 at 1418 cm−1 and 1453 cm−1 are disappeared in PSI 5. Weak peak of C C & CN bending mode of imidazole ring at 1624 cm−1 and broad peak of NH stretching mode at 3421 cm−1 also disappeared in FTIR spectrum of PSI 5. The disappearance of these corresponding BmImBr peaks in PSI 5 is a strong evidence to support the ion conduction mechanism in the polymer electrolyte as proposed in Fig. 3. First of all, the deprotonation occurs at C-2 due to the presence of nucleophile in the polymer electrolyte, which are the triflate anions and bromide ions, as illustrated below. This deprotonation results in the formation of carbene, followed by the formation of carbocation when carbene donates both electrons to the hydrogen of PVA hydroxyl group, as depicted as follows [16]. The intensity of the peak corresponding to LiTf SO3 symmetric stretching mode at 1029 cm−1 is reduced from 31.8% for PSI 0 to 30.0% for PSI 5. Besides, the peak is shifted to higher wavenumber of 1032 cm−1. However, the sharp peak designated as CF3 group stretching mode of LiTf shifts to lower wavenumber from 1167 cm−1 for PSI 0 to 1164 cm−1 for PSI 5 and the peak intensity increases from 15.0% to 20.2% in transmittance mode. The peak intensity for the LiTf characteristic peak increases from 2.9% to 4.1% in transmittance mode, with an increase in wavenumber from 1639 cm−1 to 1645 cm−1. The shifting in wavenumber and change in the intensity of these peaks is due to the incorporation of BmImBr which affects the interaction between the ionic salt and polymer as a result of the complexation of ionic liquid with polymer electrolyte. The addition of BmImBr to polymer electrolyte also causes peak shifting and change in peak intensity for the characteristic peaks of PVA. These changes in the peaks confirm the complexation and interaction between BmImBr, LiTf and PVA. There is a slight downshift from 1377 cm−1 to 1375 cm−1 for CH2 wagging mode. The increase in peak intensity of CH2 wagging mode from 2% to 4%, in transmittance mode is a strong evidence of a successful complexation of the ionic liquid and polymer electrolyte as pure BmImBr also possess this peak at 1374 cm−1. The CH deformation mode of PVA also portrays a downshift from 1430 cm−1 to 1424 cm−1 upon addition of BmImBr. The peak intensity decreases from 4.0% to 2.1%. Moreover, an upward shift from 2920 cm−1 to 2938 cm−1 occurs for the peak assigned to the asymmetrical CH stretching mode of CH2. The intensity of this peak decreases from 8% to 6% in transmittance mode for PSI 0 and PSI 5, respectively. There is a change in peak shape within the wavenumber range from 3000 cm−1 to 3700 cm−1 for both PSI 0 and PSI 5 upon addition of LiTf and BmImBr. Broad band with shoulder peaks can be observed for both PSI 0 and PSI 5. The presence of shoulder peak at 3252 cm−1 may not be observed obviously for PSI 0 due to the overlapping of other characteristic peaks which fall into the same wavenumber range. Nonetheless, the identity of broad peaks and shoulder peaks can be validated using deconvolution through peak fitting method. The findings from deconvolution for PSI 0 and PSI 5 are shown in Fig. 7 . A shoulder peak was observed from the original curve upon the addition of LiTf to PVA. This shoulder peak arises from the overlapping of the OH stretching of OH group and the characteristic peak for LiTf. As a result of peak fitting, a narrow peak and broad peak was observed with a standard error of 1.04%. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the deconvoluted peak is well-fitted with the original data. The deconvoluted peaks identified a broad peak at 3252 cm−1 which is due to the OH stretching of PVA and a sharp peak at 3445 cm−1 arise from the characteristic peak of LiTf. The overlapping of this peak further proves the complexation between LiTf and PVA. Upon the incorporation of BmImBr to the polymer-salt system, two shoulder peaks at 3105 cm−1 and 3280 cm−1 were observed from the original curve of a broad band from 3000 cm−1 to 3700 cm−1 in the spectrum of PSI 5. Peak fitting is then carried out to identify the presence of shoulder peaks. These shoulder peaks are originated from the overlapping of three peaks which are located in the same wavenumber range. Two shoulder peaks with smaller area under the curve and a sharp peak are obtained for this broad band based on the findings attained from deconvolution with standard error of 1.53%, as demonstrated in Fig. 7(b). These three peaks are the peak of =CH stretching mode of BmImBr at 3105 cm−1 (shoulder peak), OH stretching mode of OH group at 3280 cm−1 (shoulder peak) and characteristic peak of LiTf at 3378 cm−1 (sharp peak). The overlapping of peaks attributed to the vibrational mode of functional groups of PVA, LiTf and BmImBr indicating the complexation between them."
13,Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV),"3.5 Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is a quantitative analysis which is used to study the electrochemical potential window of polymer electrolyte and its stability [28]. The electrochemical potential range can be determined by the LSV response. Fig. 8 (a) and (b) illustrate the cathodic and anodic electrochemical stabilities of ionic liquid-free (PSI 0) and the highest conducting ionic liquid-added polymer electrolytes (PSI 5), respectively. From Fig. 8(a), the LSV range of PSI 0 is 4.2 V, which the cathodic potential is −2.4 V and the anodic potential is 1.8 V. On the other hand, the electrochemical potential window of PSI 5 is reduced to 2.3 V, ranging from −1.2 V to 1.1 V upon the addition of ionic liquid. The potential stability window of PSI 5 is deviated from the theoretical trend that is supposed to show a wider potential window by doping of ionic liquids to the polymer electrolytes. This might be due to the plasticising effect of BmImBr upon the addition of 50 wt% of BmImBr which greatly softened the polymer electrolyte, causing the polymer host to lose its mechanical strength and thermal stability compare to PSI 0, as discussed in section 3.3. According to Chen et al. (2019), the electrochemical stability window (ESW) width of PVA disorder slab that represents the amorphous region is 5.42 eV, which is lower than that of the PVA ordered slab that represents the crystalline region, having an ESW width of 5.94 eV [29]. It is stated that this decrease in ESW width is due to the disordered morphology of polymer can considerably distort the band edges [29]. Therefore, the decrease in the potential window of PSI 5 can be due to the high fraction of amorphous region present attributed by the impregnation of BmImBr. Two different voltage range (±3 V and ± 1.5 V) were examined in this work for PSI 5 because the polymer electrolyte starts to be degraded when it was analysed under the voltage of ± 3 V, as shown in Fig. 9 . PSI 5 shows traces of decomposition of polymer electrolyte, while the polymer electrolyte still keep its normal appearance when we reduced the voltage range to 1.5 V. Even though a shorter voltage range was observed for PSI 5, however the potential range of 2.3 V still can be applicable in EDLC cells. PSI 5 is still a promising candidate as the ionic conductivity is greater than that of PSI 0 by approximately 1914%."
14,Cyclic voltammetry (CV),"3.6 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) The charge storage performance and the capacitance of the fabricated EDLC cells using polymer electrolytes PSI 0 and PSI 5 were identified and determined using cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 0.01 Vs−1. Fig. 10 illustrates the cyclic voltammogram curves of EDLC cells assembled using PSI 0 and PSI 5 at a scan rate of 0.01 Vs−1. Based on the figure, the working principle of energy storage for both cells arises from adsorption of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which is also known as Helmholtz double layer without occurrence of chemical reaction. Non-Faradic reaction takes place in both EDLCs as the redox peak is not observed in the cyclic voltammogram [15]. Both EDLC cells adopt a leaf-like shape, with EDLC with PSI 5 electrolyte having a slightly broader curve. The specific capacitance of EDLCs is calculated using the Equations 3 and 4. The specific capacitance of EDLCs fabricated using ionic liquid-free polymer electrolyte (designated as PSI 0) is 49.1 mF cm−2 (or equivalent to 6.26 F g−1). However, the specific capacitance of EDLC using the most conducting ionic liquid-added polymer electrolyte (designated as PSI 5) is increased significantly about 32% (in term of mF cm−2) and 20.16% (in term of mF g−1) to 65.2 mF cm−2 (or equivalent to 7.54 F g−1). The specific capacitance of EDLC cell assembled with PSI 0 is lower than EDLC cell fabricated with the most conducting ionic-liquid-added polymer electrolyte, PSI 5. This arises as a result of poor interfacial contact between the electrodes and electrolyte and low ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte [16]. This abrupt increment is ascribed to the high ionic conductivity of polymer electrolyte which arises from the high mobility of ions and increase in number of available charge species [15]. Moreover, high mobility of charge ions allows for more efficient diffusion of ions through the polymer electrolyte into the pores of the porous activated carbon electrode. This movement of ions to the electrodes leads to the accumulation of ions at the double layer at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte, known as the Helmholtz double layer. Besides, greater number of charged species available in the polymer electrolyte can result in the formation of a thicker the double layer, thus the greater the charge stored by the EDLC cell. The plasticising effect induced by BmImBr to polymer electrolyte enhances the flexibility and adhesive properties of the polymer electrolyte. This improves the interfacial contact between the electrodes and electrolyte, which further enhances the specific capacitance of the EDLC cell. This allows a more efficient movement of ions to the electrode due to shorter pathway of diffusion to the electrode and better adhesion of ions to the porous activated carbon. The specific capacitance of EDLC obtained from current work is slightly higher than the previous research findings. The comparison between specific capacitances of EDLC in this present work with EDLC from the literatures are summarized in Table 3 . In conclusion, PSI 5 has a potential to be applied in EDLC application as it demonstrated higher capacitive behaviour than the reported published works."
15,Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis,"3.7 Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis The electrochemical stability of the EDLC cell fabricated with PSI 5 electrolyte is further studied by observing its Galvanostatic charge–discharge performance. GCD analysis can be used to study the charging-discharging mechanism and the cyclic stability of the EDLC cell [32]. Fig. 11 illustrates the GCD profile of the assembled cell with PSI 5 over the first 5 cycles. From Fig. 11, the discharging behaviour is almost linear. This indicates that the EDLC cell fabricated undergoes non-Faradaic mechanism during charging and discharging cycles [33]. Besides, the EDLC cell starts charging at 0.3 V instead of 0 V and the discharging of the cell occurs at 0.7 V instead of 1 V. This phenomenon occurs due to the ohmic loss and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) [34]. The internal resistance arises from the resistance of current collector used, the poor interfacial contact between the electrodes and electrolyte and the resistance during charge–discharge process [15]. There is also a slight increase of internal resistance with the number of cycles. According to Liew et al. (2015), this is caused by the ion pairs being formed during the rapid adhesion of the ions onto the porous carbon [15]. The greater number of ion pairs formed reduces the amount of available free ions that can diffuse from the electrolyte to the electric double layer in subsequent charging cycle. Besides, the ion pairs formed will result in lower ionic mobility of the ions in the electrolyte to both electrodes and also decrease the number of ions that can be accumulated at the interface, leading to the formation of thinner double layer [15,33]. This leads to an increase in cell resistance and thus reduces the capacitive behaviour of the EDLC cell. The specific capacitance of the EDLC decreases by 61.5% from 19.5 F g−1 to 7.5 F g−1, over 140 charging and discharging cycles. Despite the fact that the specific capacitance is reduced over 140 cycles, the C sp of the EDLC cell is still greater than that of some of EDLC cells reported in previous research studies. It is reported that two of the EDLC cells assembled with PVA-lithium perchlorate and PVA-lithium perchlorate-TiO2 polymer electrolytes demonstrated the specific respective capacitance of 3.3 F g−1 and 7.3 F g−1, upon the first cycle of charge and discharge. The finding from this work is still lower than the specific capacitance obtained from this work upon charging and discharging for 140 cycles [32]. Tan et al. (2019) also reported that the first specific discharging capacitance for the EDLCs with PVA-LiTf based SPE is 0.37 F g−1 [1]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the BmImBr-added polymer electrolyte is applicable for the EDLC application. Apart from that, the energy density and power density of EDLC is determined, as shown in Fig. 12 . The energy density and power density of EDLC for the first charge and discharge cycle are 1.4 Wh kg−1 and 15 W kg−1, respectively. As aforementioned, the specific discharge capacitance drops over 140 cycles as greater amount of energy is required to transport the free ions to the carbon electrode surface for adsorption, due to the ion aggregation. Upon 140 charge–discharge cycles, the power density demonstrates approximately 31% of decreases from 15 W kg−1 to 10.3 W kg−1. However, the energy density of the EDLC cell decreases from 1.4 Wh kg−1 to 0.26 Wh kg−1. The decrease in electrochemical performance of the EDLC cell might be due to the depletion of the electrolyte [15]. Besides, the reduction of free ions which are available for transportation and adsorption during charging process occurs in the electrolyte over multiple numbers of charge and discharge cycles upon depletion of electrolyte. Despite of the drop in the electrochemical performance, the EDLC cell fabricated with PSI 5 demonstrate an appropriate specific discharge capacitance over 140 cycles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 50 wt% BmImBr-added polymer electrolyte is applicable for the EDLC application."
16,Conclusion,"Solution casting technique was used to prepare solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) incorporated with conducting salt and ionic liquid in this research. The ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes increased from (9.73 ± 0.04) × 10−6 S cm−1 to (1.96 ± 0.01) × 10−4 S cm−1. This increase is attributed to the presence of BmImBr which increases the flexibility of polymer backbone and contributes to the increase in charged species. Besides, the highest conducting polymer electrolyte obeyed the Arrehenius theory at which the ion conduction mechanism is based on thermally-activated principle. The decrease in T g of the polymer electrolytes shown in DSC thermogram further proved that the plasticising effect of BmImBr. The FTIR spectra indicate the successful complexation and interaction between PVA, LiTf and BmImBr. The electrochemical potential window of polymer electrolyte decreased upon the addition of BmImBr, which is due to the increase in amorphous region within the polymer host. The electrochemical properties such as the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of the assembled cell are elevated upon the addition of BmImBr. In a nutshell, despite ionic liquid-added polymer electrolyte showed a decrease in potential window, however, the inclusion of BmImBr improved the electrical and thermal properties as well as the specific capacitance of polymer electrolytes. PSI 5 is still a promising candidate to be applied as electrolyte in the EDLC application."
