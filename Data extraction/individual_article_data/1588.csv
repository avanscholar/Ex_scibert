0,Introduction,"Recently, antibiotic pollution has caused a serious concern due to the world-wide usage of antibacterial drugs and their potential harm to humans. Antibiotics are chemical substances that are metabolized or synthesized by microorganisms, such as bacteria and molds to kill other microorganisms [1]. On the basis of chemical structure, antibiotics can be divided into tetracyclines, peptides, aminoglycosides, macrocyclic lipids, and β-type amides. Antibiotic metabolites present in industrial wastewater generally consist of high chroma, refractory pollutants and large amount of biological-based toxic substances [2,3]. It is difficult to handle the antibiotic wastewater using conventional biological treatment processes due to the inhibition of the growth of most gram-negative and gram-positive bacterium [4,5]. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are considered as the most appropriate method to degrade antibiotics dissolved in wastewater through powerful oxidants, such as hydroxyl radical ( OH), ozone, sulfate radicals and super-oxide radicals [3,4,6]. AOPs is a treatment method of waste-water that utilizes a strong oxidizing substance ( OH, ozone, super-oxide radical, etc.) with dissolved pollutants in the waste-water to degrade the pollutants [7,8].On the basis of the production of oxide species, different AOPs are identified and include Fenton oxidation method, photocatalytic oxidation method, electrochemical oxidation method, electro-catalytic oxidation method, and low-temperature plasma method [9,10]. Compared with different AOPs, EF process involves the generation of OH radicals through Eqs. (1) and (2), and has received much attention for wastewater treatment due to low cost, high efficiency and simplicity [11,12]. The method has been widely used to treat wastewater containing toxic and environmentally persistent pollutants, such as pesticides, organic synthetic dyes and antibiotics [3,12,13]. EF is based on in-situ electro-generation of H2O2 on the cathode by adding Fe2+ as a catalyst for continuous generation of OH in acidic media (see Eqs. (1) and (2)) [5,14]. (1) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2 (2) Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH + OH− EF process is effective for the remediation of various effluents that are not efficiently treated using biological technologies [15,16]. Considerable efforts have been devoted to studying the cathodic material and the operational conditions for improving the efficiency of EF system, while relatively little attention has been paid to the design of the aeration system [17,18]. In order to have efficient electro-generation of H2O2, there is need to design suitable reactors to avoid the limitation of low solubility of oxygen in water under normal conditions (0.25 mM/8 mg dm−3) [19]. In recent years based upon flow-through electrodes, researchers have proposed a novel electro-chemical reactor that has favorable mass transport properties [19]. In the EF reactors, there is need to ensure a continuous supply of oxygen to minimize the mass shift limitations and for reducing the energy consumption [20]. Several studies have shown that the production of H2O2 can be greatly enhanced in suitably designed reactors, whereas the mass transfer of oxygen on the cathodes can be improved by pressurizing the system by using micro- or venturi-reactors and cells equipped with rotating cathodes [3,21,22]. The simplest method is to bubble the gas into the electrolyte having low concentration of oxygen, that results in a slow oxygen transfer to the cathode [21,23]. Therefore, different reactor configurations have been designed that use parallel-plate micro-fluidic cells and rotating disks to increase the transfer of oxygen [24]. Gas diffusion electrode (GDEs) is one of the most commonly used system [7]. At normal pressure, GDEs stabilize the gas-liquid-solid interface that can balance the gas and electrolyte in the micro-pores. The electro-chemical reaction takes place under controlled electrical potential [25]. However, GDEs still have some disadvantages, including (i) the oxygen utilization is very low [23,26]. (ii) It needs a pressure compressor during the reaction to maintain the equilibrium at both sides of the electrodes [3,27]. (iii) The performance of GDEs declined after several cycles, thus increasing the cost of the cell. Therefore, by improving the performance of GDEs, not only the output power of the entire cell is increased, but the cost of the cell is also reduced [3,23,28]. However, all of the previously discussed treatment methods require a compressor to be used, which increases the capital and operational investments. A jet aerator is a compressor-free system based on the venturi effect that efficiently supplies oxygen to a system. When liquid flows through the jet aerator, atmosphere will be drawn into the system due to the venturi effect, thus inducing the formation of bubbles in the system. The mixture will generate higher oxygen concentrations than the equilibrium concentration because of the formation of bubbles. Therefore, the system can enhance the oxygen transfer to cathode, leading to an increase in the production of H2O2. This study uses an innovative approach (the vertical flow reactor) that supplies oxygen to the system at moderate pressures, which is unaccompanied by external compressor and therefore, demands very low energy. The pressure in this reactor is solely due to the gravity of the nozzle which can be adjusted by the speed of water flow. The electro-Fenton system (EF) was developed by using a vertical flow reactor to enhance the electro-generation of H2O2 and remove organic pollutants. In the vertical-flow EF system, the effects of current density, initial pH and water flow rate on the generation of H2O2 are studied. The effects of current density, Fe2+ concentration, initial pH and water flow rate on the removal efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride were investigated. The study aims to explore the removal mechanism of tetracycline hydrochloride, the stability of the proposed reactor, and the application of the proposed system to remove various other pollutants from wastewaters."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Main materials,"2.1 Main materials Tetracycline hydrochloride, acid magenta, rhodamine B, alizarin yellow R, orange Ⅳ and diclofenac sodium were purchased from the Aladdin China Company. Graphite felts (Q-TZO5QC-B) (with thickness of 5 mm) were purchased from Shanghai Qijie Carbon Material Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of cathode materials,"2.2 Preparation of cathode materials Before the modification of the electrode material, the graphite felt material should be cleaned to remove the stains and grease. After washed with ultrasonic assistance for 30 min, dried at 80℃ for 24 h, cooled and sealed for storage. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were produced by Shenzhen Nano-Company, China. Appropriate amounts of CNTs, carbon black, polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE), ultrapure water and isopropyl alcohol were ultrasonically dispersed. Next, the emulsion was coated onto two-sided graphite felt and calcined at 365 °C for 60 min. Based on our previous research, the CNT-CB-(3:2) was used as the electrode [1]."
4,Electro-generation of H2O2,"2.3 Electro-generation of H2O2 We used a jet aerator, an effect-based compressor-free system, to supply oxygen to the H2O2 electrolyzer. When the liquid flows through the throat of the jet aerator, the atmosphere is drawn into the system through the Venturi effect, and due to the formation of bubbles, generating a biphasic mixture with a concentration in oxygen higher than the equilibrium one. The H2O2 electrocatalytic production process was carried out using the reaction apparatus shown in Fig. 1 a. The reactor is divided into two configurations, one is cross flow reactor (Fig. 1b), and the other is vertical flow reactor (Fig. 1c). In addition, the H2O2 generation process of the GDEs of the conventional aeration mode was also evaluated. H2O2 production experiment was conducted in two electrode single room with 0.05 M Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte at 100 mL solution, graphite felt or CNT-CB-(3:2) as cathode (Φ 2 cm) and DSA anode (Φ 2 cm) as anode. 0.5 mL samples were taken every 10 min to analyse the concentration of the H2O2."
5,Degradation by EF,2.4 Degradation by EF The degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride and others by EF process were carried out in the same apparatus at initial concentration of 50 mgL−1 and 0.05 M Na2 SO4 was added as supporting electrolyte. The pH value was adjusted by H2SO4 or NaOH and FeSO4 was introduced to provide 0.3 mM Fe2+were added into the solution to initiate EF reaction. The samples were taken at certain intervals to determine the degradationefficiency and TOC removal efficiency.
6,Analytic methods,"2.5 Analytic methods The concentration of H2O2 was measured using the potassium titanium (IV) oxalate method at λmax on a spectrophometer (VI-1501, Tianjin Gangdong Instrument Analysis Instrument Co., Ltd). The TOC of tetracycline hydrochlorideand diclofenac sodium in the EF process was determined by a TOC analyzer (Analytikjena multi N/C 3100, Germany). At regular intervals during the reaction, samples were taken to determine the removal rate of contaminants and the TOC removal rate. The absorbance of the others was determined by the spectrophotometry. The maximum absorption wavelengths of acid fuchsin, rhodamine B and alizarin yellow R were 540 nm, 554 nm and 372 nm, respectively. The removal efficiency was calculated by Eq. (3): (3) η = A 0 A t A 0 × 100 % where A0 and At are the absorbances of the contaminants at the beginning of the reaction and at a given time, respectively. The current efficiency (CE) was calculated by Eq. (4): (4) CE = nF C H 2 O 2 ∫ 0 t I d t × 100 % where n is the number of electrons, F is the Faraday constant (96,487 C mol−1), V cell volume, [H2O2] (M) concentration H2O2, I (A) applied current and t (s) solution residence time in the cell. The energy consumption of the system (kWh m−3) was calculated by Eq. (5): (5) Energy c o n s u m p t i o n = UIt V where U is the average battery voltage (V), I is the current (A), V is the volume of the solution (m3), and T is the processing time (h)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Effect of jet reactor on H2O2 generation,"3.1 Effect of jet reactor on H2O2 generation 3.1.1 Comparison of different aeration methods In order to enhance the production of H2O2, EF process requires oxygen or air sparging into the solution [20]. Under normal pressure, GDEs balance the amount of gas and the electrolyte in micro-pores, form a stable gas-liquid-solid interface, and produce H2O2 at a certain potential [3]. However, some of the conventional GDEs have oxygen utilization efficiency of less than 0.1% which indicates that most of the oxygen was not effectively used for H2O2 production. The production of H2O2 in the vertical flow reactor was compared with those in conventional GDEs using a CNT-CB-(3:2) as the cathode. Previous studies have reported that rotating cathode aeration could also promote the production of H2O2 [2,3]. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of H2O2 production, CE and energy consumption in different reactors. Before the electrode was modified in the vertical flow reactor, only 73 mg L−1 of H2O2 could be produced after 120 min of reaction, while 1418 mg L−1 of H2O2 was produced after the use of modified electrode. The concentration of H2O2 obtained in the vertical flow reactor (1418 mg L−1) was found to be higher than those in both the horizontal flow reactor (870 mg L−1) and the raditional gas diffusion cathode system (684 mg L−1). In the vertical flow jet reactor, the H2O2 production using the modified electrode CNT-CB-(3:2) increased by 37%. The CE was maintained within the range of 93–98% in the vertical flow reactor, which is also much higher than the other reactors. The vertical flow reactor with a lower energy consumption (5.60 kWh kg−1) gives a higher H2O2 yield of 22 mg h−1 cm−3 as compared to the conventional graphite electrodes. In vertical jet reactor, the jet pressure with a mixing chamber would ensure the proper mixing of water with the injected air. Meanwhile, the oxygen conversion could reach to 25% in the vertical jet reactor, which was much higher than the traditional aeration system (10%). Therefore, the vertical flow jet reactor was a powerful aeration system having higher H2O2 production and lower energy consumption. 3.1.2 Effect of current density Fig. 3 a shows that the accumulation of H2O2 enhanced from 592 mg L−1 to 1443 mg L−1, while the current density increased form 12 mA cm−2 to 28 mA cm−2 [2,3]. The higher current density not only accelerated the electron transfer within the solution, but also improved the anodic oxidation, which would lead to an increase in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [3,21,22] and dissolved oxygen (DO) [2,3]. However, the accumulation of H2O2 is not linear at the start and tends to be balanced due to the competing reactions, such as self-decomposition (Eq. (6)), anodic oxidation (Eq. (7)) or reduction to water on the cathode (Eq. (8)). Oxygen reduction reaction selectively determines the production of H2O2. It mainly consists of the 2e− reaction (see Eq. (1)) that produces H2O2 and 4e− reaction that produces H2O (see Eq. (6)). At high current density, the charge transfer is faster than the supply of oxygen to the surface of cathode [7,8]. Therefore, H2O2 and O2 can be reduced to H2O as depicted in Eqs. (8) and (6), and could evolve hydrogen gas in the reaction by accepting electrons as given by Eq. (7). Therefore, the current density and O2 supply must be balanced to achieve efficient production of H2O2. The energy consumption of the current density increases significantly with the increase of current density from 12 to 28 mA cm−2 [24], as shown in Fig. 3a. (6) O2 + 4e−+4H+→2H2O (7) 2H++2e−→H2 3.1.3 Effect of initial pH The effect of pH on the production of H2O2 is shown in Fig. 3b. The concentrations of H2O2 were 1252 mg L−1, 1311 mg L−1, 1418 mg L−1 and 966 mg L−1 after 120 min of reaction, while the initial pH values were 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. The production of H2O2 was gradually enhanced with the increase of initial pH, though it decreased under alkaline conditions. This is probably due to the presence of free radicals in alkaline conditions, such as the ̇HO2 radical, which decomposes H2O2 [20]. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was electro-generated at the cathode surface by reducing oxygen in an acidic medium (Eq. (1)), leading to an enhancement of the production of H2O2. However, the elevated levels of H+ can cause the decomposition of H2O2 (see Eq. (8)) [7,8]. Moreover, water is generated due to the consumption of four electrons by oxygen during the reduction reaction (Eq. (6)), while at the anode, parasitic reactions would occur due to the increase in electron transfer process [1]. Therefore, the highest production of H2O2 was achieved at the pH value of 7 with the largest CE and the lowest EEC. 3.1.4 Effect of water flow rate Fig. 3c shows the effect of water flow rate on the production of H2O2, CE and EEC. Fig. 3c shows that the water flow rate is directly related with the amount of air carried by the system and the concentration of H2O2. However, when the water flow rate increases to a very high value (for example, >15 L h−1), the concentration of H2O2 reduces. The concentration of H2O2 was enhanced from 200 mg L−1 to 1400 mg L−1 when the water flow rate increased from 5 L h−1 to15 L h−1. This might be due to the reason that the increase in water flow rate would improve the supply of oxygen, thus promoting the rate of mass transfer of oxygen in the solution, which is conducive to the electro-generation of H2O2 [19]. The larger water flow rate might also decrease the efficiency of oxygen in the system. Meanwhile, the CE was found to be lying within the ranges of 40–58%, 55–85%, 93–98% and 77–92% at the water flow rates of 0 L h−1, 5 L h−1, 10 L h−1 and 15 L h−1, respectively. 3.1.5 Comparison with literatures In order to verify the performance of H2O2 production in vertical flow reactor, the performance has been compared with other systems reported in literature (see Table 1 ). The materials used in the aeration method greatly affected the production of H2O2, whereas the vertical flow reactor could largely enhance the performance of the system. Previous studies have reported that the applied potential and electrolyte flow conditions affect the in-situ formation of H2O2 in the electrochemical flow reactors containing GDEs. The electrolysis reactions were performed in an aqueous acidic medium using GDEs constructed using conductive black graphite material and polytetrafluoroethylene [7]. Hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) exhibited high activity to reduce O2 and has high H2O2 selectivity [25]. Electro-chemical technology and modified gas diffusion electrode (MGDE) offer a viable alternative for the industrial-scale synthesis of oxidants [24]. The hydrogen generation using gaseous diffusion cathode in low-ionic strength solution indicates that the H2O2 generation rate in the vertical flow reactor was higher, while the EEC of the vertical flow reactor was lower than 5.92 kWh kg−1 [23,26]. An advantage of the cathode was the efficient production of H2O2 with high oxygen utilization efficiency. Therefore, the system was used for the removal of various pollutants in the EF process."
9,Tetracycline hydrochloride removal,"3.2 Tetracycline hydrochloride removal 3.2.1 Effect of current density In order to estimate the performance of vertical flow reactor, tetracycline hydrochloride was chosen as the model pollutant and its removal in the reactor was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the tetracycline hydrochloride removal was similar to the H2O2 production with the change of current density. These outcomes indicated that the concentration of H2O2 was affected by the performance of EF for removing various pollutants [29]. The tetracycline hydrochloride removal rate increased from 95% to 99% within 30 min of reaction, while the current density increased from 24 to 28 mA cm−2. The highest CE was observed at 24 mA cm−2, which was found to be 97% (Fig. 3a). Additionally, the tetracycline hydrochloride removal rate was the highest, and reached the value of around 100% within 40 min of reaction. These results indicate that 24 mAcm−2 was an appropriate current density for the EF process, whereas vertical flow reactor was an economical alternative for removing tetracycline hydrochloride from wastewater. 3.2.2 Effect of Fe2+ concentration Ferrous ion (Fe2+) concentration plays a significant role in removing pollutants in the EF system. Tetracycline hydrochloride removal efficiency increased gradually with the increase of Fe2+ concentration and decreased when Fe2+ concentration became higher than 0.3 mM (Fig. 4b). This was because of the presence of excessive Fe2+, which would react with OH radicals to inhibit the reaction (as given by Eq. (8)). (8) OH + Fe2+ → Fe3+ + OH– The removal efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloride was found to be higher than 99% within the 30 min of reaction. It was also observed that, with the decrease in the Fe2+ concentration, the EF reaction could not be initiated normally, which was due to the reason that the OH concentration of the system was too little, as a result of which, the removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride declined. When the initial Fe2+ concentration was higher, the consumption of OH increased, due to which, the degradation rate also increased [2,3]. 3.2.3 Effect of initial pH As shown in Fig. 4c, the pH value of 3 was the most appropriate value for the electron-Fenton reaction. The removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride decreased abruptly at initial pH values due to the precipitation of Fe2+ ions [7]. However, tetracycline hydrochloride removal rate reached the values of 63% and 78% at the pH values of 5 and 7, respectively. These results indicate that the vertical flow reactor can effectively remove pollutants under a wide range of pH conditions. 3.2.4 Effect of water flow rate Fig. 4d shows that tetracycline hydrochloride removal rate was greatly enhanced with the increase of water flow rate. After 60 min of reaction, the removal rates of tetracycline hydrochloride were found to be 63, 80, 99, and 85% for the water flow rates of 0, 5, 10, and 15 L h−1, respectively. The water flow rate would increase the supply of oxygen, thus enhancing the H2O2 production, which then, increases the performance of the system for the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride. These findings suggested that the enhancement of water flow rate could increase the DO and promote the rate of mass transfer, which are conducive to the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride. 3.2.5 Effect of tetracycline hydrochloride concentrations Since the concentrations of tetracycline hydrochloride were different in different wastewaters, the effect of initial tetracycline hydrochloride concentration (within the range of 50–200 mg L−1) was investigated. After 60 min of reaction, the removal rates of tetracycline hydrochloride and TOC were 99, 81 and 44% for the initial tetracycline hydrochloride concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mg L−1, respectively (see Fig. 5 ). For lower initial concentrations, faster removal of tetracycline hydrochloride was observed, which was due to the fast oxidation that utilized the same OH radicals generated in the system [19]. However, total removed quantity of tetracycline hydrochloride increased with the increase of initial tetracycline hydrochloride concentration. The results indicated that the vertical flow reactor was feasible for a wide range of pollutant concentrations [7,8]."
10,Comparison of different processes,"3.3 Comparison of different processes Various experiments were carried out to investigate the comparison of removal rates, including EF, adsorption, EA + AO + H2O2 and EF + Isopropanol. As shown in Fig. 7, adsorption, EA + AO + H2O2 and EF + Isopropanol showed only a small degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride. After 60 min of reaction, for adsorption, EA + AO + H2O2 and EF + Isopropanol, the corresponding removal rates of tetracycline hydrochloride were found to be 8%, 20% and 16%, respectively. The removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride reached100% using the EF process, which might be attributed to a faster generation of OH radicals. These results demonstrated that cathodic adsorption, anodization, and H2O2 oxidation had minor effects on the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride, whereas the OH radicals are the most important oxidizing substance in the system. The enhanced production of H2O2 could largely increase the generation of OH radicals in the EF system. High concentrations of OH radicals can not only attack the pollutant macromolecules, but also continue to attack smaller molecular fragments after the oxidation of macromolecules until they are completely oxidized, thus resulting in an efficient degradation of pollutants in the vertical flow reactor [20]."
11,Wide application of the vertical flow reactor,"3.4 Wide application of the vertical flow reactor 3.4.1 Stability of the reactor The stability of the EF system is important for practical use. Therefore, the performance of the EF reactor for five continuous runs (cycles) for the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride was investigated. Fig. 6 shows the removal of tetracycline hydrochloride and TOC in five continuous runs. The removal rates of tetracycline hydrochloride and TOC remained higher than 95% and 80% in the five continuous runs. The results indicated that the vertical flow reactor was relatively stable and could be recycled for the removal of pollutants. 3.4.2 The applicability for various pollutants Tetracycline hydrochloride was removed very quickly in the vertical flow reactor. Therefore, it would be reasonable to study if the reactor had the same high degradation effect on various organic pollutants, such as dyes and pharmaceuticals or not. The acid magenta, rhodamine B, alizarin yellow R, orange Ⅳ and diclofenac sodium were used to study this aspect of the work. As shown in Fig. 8 , the removal rates of acid magenta, rhodamine B, orange Ⅳ and diclofenac sodium were maintained beyond 90% after 60 min of reaction. The removal rate of alizarin yellow was more than 80% after 60 min of reaction. Meanwhile, after 180 min of reaction, the TOC removal rates of acid magenta, rhodamine B, alizarin yellow R, orange Ⅳ and diclofenac sodium were 76%, 78%, 61%, 72%, and 83%, respectively. Therefore, the vertical flow reactor could efficiently remove a wide range of organic pollutants from the wastewater."
12,Conclusions,"A novel jet-type reactor (vertical flow reactor) was designed to enhance the H2O2 production. The H2O2 production in the vertical flow reactor within 120 min reaction could reach the value of 1419 mg L−1, which was much larger than in both the horizontal flow reactor (870 mg L−1) and the raditional gas diffusion cathode system (684 mg L−1). The removal of tetracycline hydrochloride was around 100%, whereas that of TOC was 88% within the 60 min of reaction. Moreover, The EF process showed stability, due to which the removal efficiencies of tetracycline hydrochloride and TOC were maintained at above 95% and 80% in five continuous runs (cycles). Furthermore, the vertical flow reactor could also efficiently remove a wide range of organic pollutants. Therefore, the vertical flow reactor is a promising electro-Fenton system for treating wastewaters."
