0,Introduction,"The epoxides belong to a group of ethers; however, their properties are different than those of the typical ethers, due to the internal strain in the heterocyclic ring. They are very reactive and susceptible to the reaction with a great number of reagents owing to the polarity and the strain of the CO bonds. They react with electrophilic and nucleophilic compounds, acids, bases and some of the oxidative compounds [1]. A character and the properties of the epoxides determine the application of these compounds in many branches of industry. They are used primarily as the intermediates in the productions of various useful materials, and new applications are still being developed. Traditional methods of the epoxide synthesis relied on the intramolecular cyclization of chlorohydrins with the use of aqueous alkaline solutions or on the alkenes epoxidation with per-acids [2]. There have been developed new directions in the synthesis of this group of compounds in recent years. They rely on the elimination of organic wastes, by-products difficult to manage and on the limitation of quantity of generated sewage. These objectives were achieved through the catalytic processes of the oxidation of olefinic compounds with organic hydroperoxides or hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is considered to be the most ecological oxidizing agent in synthesis processes. The epoxidation of methallyl alcohol with 30wt.% hydrogen peroxide over titanium silicalite catalyst TS-1 belongs to this group. 2-Methylglycidol finds various applications, especially in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, e.g. S-(α)-methylcysteine, which is used for synthesis compounds exhibiting antitumor and anti-HIV-1 activities [3,4]. Moreover, 2-methylglycidol finds the application in the synthesis of aziridines, oxazolines and oxazolidines, which are intermediate for the preparation of α-methyl-α-amino acids applied for synthesis enzyme inhibitors, drugs and cosmetics [5,6]. 2-Methylglycidol is also used in the preparation of various natural products and their analogues (Vitamin D3, several choline and acetylcholine analogues) [5]. 2-Methylglycidol has also importance in the synthesis of a novel immunomodulator ((+)-conagenin), which fulfils an important role in therapy of diseases, such as cancer or transplantation [7]. The structure of 2-methylglycidol is present in AK-toxins which are host-specific toxins produced by Alternaria altenata Japanese pear pathotype; this discovery led to the production of synthetic AK-toxins. The structure of 2-methylglycidol was also found in Azinomycins-antitumor antibiotics [8]. Moreover, 2-methylglycidol is used for the synthesis of (1S)-(−)-frontalin which is sex attractant discharged by insects (beetles and woodworms) and adult male Asian elephants [9]. 2-Methylglycidol has also importance in the production of polymers, which are used for the manufacture of quick-drying varnishes, drawing inks, printer's adhesives and another adhesive materials [10], and the other group of 2-methylglycidol applications includes the surface active agents which are applied in the production of shampoo, detergents for washing, toothpaste and cosmetics [11]. An objective of the presented studies was to determine the technological parameters of the process, which allowed the preparation of 2-methylglycidol with the highest selectivity in relation to consumed methallyl alcohol and with the maximum conversion of the methallyl alcohol. An important function describing the course of the epoxidation was also the of selectivity transformation to organic compounds in relation to consumed hydrogen peroxide. The optimalization was carried out in order to reduce the quantity of the following by-products: 2-methylglycerol, 2-methylacroleine, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol, 3-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,2-diol, methallyl ether, ethers and polymers."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of TS-1 catalyst and its characteristics,"2.1 Preparation of TS-1 catalyst and its characteristics The TS-1 catalyst was prepared by a method of Thangaraj et al. [12]. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (Fluka) and tetrabutyl orthotitanate (Fluka) were used as raw materials, whereas tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide, TPAOH (Fluka), was used as the template agent. The crystallization of gel was carried out under the static conditions at 175°C for 8 days. After separation from the parent liquid, the crystals were dried at 120°C for 12h and subsequently in a furnace at 550°C for 24h. The calcined catalyst was activated by washing with a 10% aqueous solution of ammonium acetate at 80°C and recalcined at 550°C for 24h. The characterization of the catalyst was performed using the conventional techniques. The chemical composition of the catalyst was established by means of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) on a VRA 30 spectrometer. The catalyst contained 1.7wt.% Ti. The crystalline structure of sample was confirmed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) by means of a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at wavelength of 0.154nm. The XRD pattern was obtained between 5° and 50° 2θ. It was identical with XRD patterns reported by Perego et al. and Thangaraj et al. [13,14]. The FT-IR spectrum of the TS-1 sample was recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-430 instrument using the KBr pellet techniques. The catalyst concentration in KBr amounted to 1.4wt.%. The presence of the absorption band ∼960cm−1 was found for this spectrum. The UV–vis spectrum was recorded on a SPECORD M40 instrument. The UV–vis spectrum shows a characteristic band at 220nm, which confirms the incorporation of titanium into the crystalline structure of silica. There were not any additional bands showing the presence of titanium extra-framework. The morphology of the crystals was determined on the basis of the SEM micrographs taken on a Jeol JSM-6100 scanning microscope. They were uniform orthorhombic crystallites with a size in the 0.6–0.8μm range."
3,"Epoxidation procedure, apparatus and analytical methods","2.2 Epoxidation procedure, apparatus and analytical methods The epoxidation of methallyl alcohol was carried out with the following reagents: methallyl alcohol (MAA) (98wt.%, Fluka), hydrogen peroxide (30wt.% aqueous solution, POCh, Gliwice), methanol (analytical grade, POCh, Gliwice) and TS-1 catalyst. The epoxidation was carried out in a stainless steel autoclave equipped with a PTFE insert of 7cm3. The autoclave was charged with reagents in the following order: methallyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, methanol (solvent) and the catalyst. The reactor was closed, fixed in a shaker holder and immersed in the oil bath having a temperature corresponding to the reaction temperature, which was controlled by a thermostat. After completing the reaction, the mass balance was performed. In addition, the functions describing the process (the conversion of MAA, the selectivity of transformation to 2-methylglycidol in relation to consumed MAA and the selectivity of transformation to organic compounds in relation to consumed H2O2) were calculated. The quantitative analyses of 2-methylglycidol were performed chromatographically on a Chrom 5 apparatus equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and using a column packed with Chromosorb 101 (60/80mesh). The column temperature was programmed: isothermally 170°C for 6min, followed by an increase at the rate 15°C/min, isothermally 200°C for 10min, then increased at the rate 20°C/min, isothermally 225°C for 14min, and finally cooled to 170°C. The quantitative analyses were performed by the external standard method [15]. Hydrogen peroxide consumption was determined iodometrically [16]."
4,Results and discussion,"In the epoxidation process of methallyl alcohol with 30wt.% hydrogen peroxide over TS-1 titanium silicalite catalyst 2-methylglycidol was formed together with by-products. Depending on the process parameters, different amounts of the following by-products were obtained: 2-methylglycerol, 2-methylacroleine, methallyl ether, methallyl-methylglycidyl ether, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol, 3-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,2-diol and polymers. A high temperature caused the formation of polymers, which included mers of methallyl alcohol and 2-methylglycidol, as well as by-products. The reactions are presented in Scheme 1 . 2-Methylglycidol is the most susceptible to the attack of the nucleophilic molecules (in this case, water and methanol) present in the reaction medium. This reaction causes the opening of the epoxide ring of 2-methylglycidol and the formation of 2-methylglycerol, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol and 3-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,2-diol. In the case of process carried out at high temperatures, the epoxide ring-opening reaction occurs which leads to the formation of polyethers regardless of the chemical nature of the medium. In this work were presented the results of the investigations performed to determine the influence of the technological parameters on the epoxidation of methallyl alcohol. The following parameters were studied: temperature (20–120°C), the MAA/H2O2 molar ratio (1–5mol/mol), methanol concentration (5–90wt.%), TS-1 catalyst content in the reaction mixture (0.1–2.0wt.%) and reaction time (0.5–5.0h). The parameters of experiments were determined according to a rotatable-uniform design [17,18]. Experimental design and the calculations were performed by computer using a software Cadex: Esdet 2.2 [19]. The real and normalized (coded) input variables at the levels resulting from the experimental design are shown in Table 1 . The real values of input variables x 1–x 5 were recalculated into the normalized values (dimensionless) according to the equation: X k = 2 α ( x k − x k min ) ( x k max − x k min ) − α where, X k ∈[−α, α]; X k is the normalized input variable, k =1, …, i; I is the number of input variables (i =5); α is the star arm (α =2); x k is the real input variable, k =1, …, i; x k max is the maximum value of the real input variable, k =1, …, i; x k min is the minimum value of the real input variable, and k =1, …, i. The matrix of experiment design and experimentally determined values of the response functions: selectivity of transformation to 2-methylglycidol in relation to consumed methallyl alcohol (S2-MGLY/MAA), conversion of methallyl alcohol (KMAA) and selectivity transformation to organic compounds in relation to consumed hydrogen peroxide ( S org / H 2 O 2 ) are shown in Table 2 . The influence of input variables x 1–x 5 (technological parameters) on the values of the response functions (S2-MGLY/MAA, KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 ) in the epoxidation process of methallyl alcohol was presented in the form of a polynomial of second-order: Z i = b 0 + ∑ i = 1 k b i x i + ∑ i < j k b i j x i x j + ∑ i = 1 k b i i x i 2 where Z i is a dependent variable (value of the function); b 0, b i , b ij , b ii are the coefficients of the approximation function (regression equation); x i , x j are the process parameters as independent factors; and k is the number of the experimental design factors. The maximum values of the response functions in the epoxidation process of methallyl alcohol and corresponding to them values of the technological parameters were summarized in Table 3 . The data included in Table 3 were obtained as a result of the process optimization by means of experimental design method. From Table 3 results that a 100mol% selectivity of the transformation of methallyl alcohol to 2-methylglycidol can be achieved with the following parameters: temperature 83°C, the equimolecular ratio of MAA/H2O2, methanol concentration 5wt.%, TS-1 content 2wt.% and reaction time 0.5h. A change of value of whichever technological parameter, two or more parameters, decreases a value of the function S2-MGLY/MAA. The process parameters which allow to obtain the maximum values of the functions KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 are the same. Only a maximum conversion of methallyl alcohol requires a longer reaction time (4.2h). After such time, the organic compounds were formed less selectively in relation to both hydrogen peroxide and methallyl alcohol consumed. A decrease of the selectivity of transformation to 2-methylglycidol in relation to methallyl alcohol as a result of extended reaction time is caused by its hydration. An achievement of a high selectivity of transformation to organic compounds in relation to consumed hydrogen peroxide also requires a short reaction time, 0.7h, because prolongation of the reaction time leads to an ineffective decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. From the values of the investigated function which describe process, it can be seen that the equimolecular ratio of MAA/H2O2 is optimal during the epoxidation of methallyl alcohol in the direction of 2-methylglycidol. In order to present the influence of the technological parameters on the functions describing the epoxidation process of methallyl alcohol (S2-MGLY/MAA, KMAA, S org / H 2 O 2 ), a general regression equation was reduced to a function of one real variable. The values of functions describing the process were calculated for established remaining parameters, in which the functions take the maximum values (Table 3). The investigated technological parameter has then a variable value, which is limited by the boundary conditions of the process. Fig. 1 presents the effect of the process temperature on the course of the functions: S2-MGLY/MAA, KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 . The remaining parameters have constant values for a given function and are presented in Table 3. From Fig. 1 results that with regard to KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 , the most favourable temperature is 20°C. An increase of temperature leads to decreased values of the investigated functions and results in an ineffective decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. The selectivity of transformation to organic compounds in relation to hydrogen peroxide decreases significantly from 100mol% to 0mol% in the range of investigated temperature 20–120°C, while in the case of methallyl alcohol conversion, an increase of temperature only slightly decreases the values of the investigated function from 80mol% to ∼58mol%. The function of the selectivity transformation to 2-methylglycidol in relation to consumed methallyl alcohol (S2-MGLY/MAA) rises with increasing temperature and achieves the maximum value (100mol%) at 83°C. A further increase of temperature causes a decrease of the value of function to about 83mol% at temperature 120°C. At higher temperatures (90–120°C) formed 2-methylglycidol undergoes in a larger degree to the side reactions, such as: hydration, etherification and polymerization. The polymeric products which are formed during the epoxidation at temperatures 90–120°C could block the pores of the catalyst and this process leads to decrease of activity of the catalyst and also the conversion of methallyl alcohol decreases. At the high temperatures (especially since 85°C) 2-methylglycerol starts to form. As results from the studies of Davies et al. [20] the presence of this triol with hydrogen peroxide and TS-1 catalyst causes an extensive leaching of Ti from TS-1 framework. This process decreases the activity of TS-1 and also decreases the values of functions: S2-MGLY/MAA, KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 . Thus the temperature 80°C was found to be the most advantageous. Fig. 2 shows the influence of the molar ratio of MAA/H2O2 on the course of functions: S2-MGLY/MAA, KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 . The equimolecular ratio MAA/H2O2 is the most favourable for each investigated function. The functions take the maximum values at this molar ratio and an increase of the molecular ratio decreases the values of all investigated functions. Among these three functions, only S2-MGLY/MAA decreases in a linear manner and a decrease of this function is also the largest. The low molar ratio MAA/H2O2 is also advantageous because it restricts the amount of ethers and polymeric products formed during the epoxidation process. Their formation leads to blocking the pores of catalyst and decreases the activity of catalyst; thus, a more frequent regeneration of the catalyst by calcination would be necessary. Fig. 3 presents the effect of methanol concentration on the course of the same functions. A low methanol concentration allows to achieve a high selectivity of transformation of methallyl alcohol to 2-methylglycidol (S2-MGLY/MAA). Under these conditions, the formed 2-methylglycidol reacts less intensively with methanol or water in the reaction which relies on the opening of the epoxide ring [21]. However, an achievement of a high conversion of methallyl alcohol and the selectivity of transformation to organic compounds in relation to consumed hydrogen peroxide requires the application of the high solvent concentration. For the epoxidation process, it is the most advantageous to use the smallest amount of solvent. At low methanol concentration, the function S2-MGLY/MAA achieves the highest value but two other functions have low values. This low concentration of solvent also restricts an amount of by-products (polymeric products and 2-methylglycerol), the presence of which decreases the activity of catalyst. The unreacted methallyl alcohol and solvent could be recovered and reused in the process. Fig. 4 shows the influence of the TS-1 catalyst concentration on the course of functions: S2-MGLY/MAA, KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 . The remaining parameters have the constant values for a given function and are presented in Table 3. The functions KMAA and S org / H 2 O 2 have a similar course in this case and their values decrease with increase of the catalyst content. However, the selectivity of transformation to 2-methylglycidol in relation to consumed methallyl alcohol rises significantly (function S2-MGLY/MAA). This selectivity of conversion reaches the maximum value of 100mol% after the introduction of 2wt.% of the TS-1 catalyst in relation to the sum of the reactants. This phenomenon can be explained by the mechanism of the epoxidation described by Adam et al. [22]. An enhancement of the catalyst concentration increases the number of the active sites associated with the presence of titanium atoms in the crystalline structure of silica. The active sites directly participate in the formation of five-membered cyclic active compound responsible for the epoxidation reaction. The use of the highest concentration of TS-1 catalyst (2wt.%) is the most advantageous because this restricts the amount of formed 2-methylglycerol, the presence of which leads to leaching of Ti from the framework of TS-1. Thus, the TS-1 catalyst which was several times used in the epoxidation process could be regenerated without a loss of activity and reused in the process. From Fig. 5 results that the functions, S2-MGLY/MAA and S org / H 2 O 2 , reach the maximum values after a short reaction time. In the case of S2-MGLY/MAA, this time amounts to 0.5h and for S org / H 2 O 2 0.7h. A decrease of the selectivity of transformation to 2-methylglycidol during prolonged reaction time is caused by a high reactivity of the epoxide ring which leads to the most intensive formation of 2-methylglycerol, but the small quantities of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol and 3-methoxy-2-methylpropane-1,2-diol are also formed at sufficiently long time. The selectivity of transformation to organic compounds in relation to hydrogen peroxide decreases during prolonged reaction time. That means that an ineffective consumption of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen rises, but prolongation of the reaction time increases the conversion of methallyl alcohol. It results from Fig. 5 that a short reaction time, 0.7h, is the most advantageous."
5,Conclusions,"The investigations of the epoxidation of methallyl alcohol with 30wt.% hydrogen peroxide over titanium silicalite TS-1 catalyst allowed to determine the maximum values of functions describing the process and corresponding to their parameters. The following maximum values of the investigated functions were obtained: S2-MGLY/MAA =100mol%, KMAA =80mol% and S org / H 2 O 2 =100mol%. The optimum parameters for each function are significantly different. Only the equimolecular ratio MAA/H2O2 showed to be the best for all three functions. We could determine the set of the technological parameters, which the best describes the process of methallyl alcohol epoxidation when we take into consideration the importance of these functions in the course of the process. The most favourable course of the process is ensured by the following parameters: temperature, 80°C; the equimolecular ratio, MAA/H2O2; methanol concentration, 5wt.%; catalyst content in reaction mixture, 2wt.%; and reaction time, 0.7h. When these conditions were tested in a true epoxidation process, the following values of the investigated functions were obtained: S2-MGLY/MAA =95mol%, KMAA =30mol% and S org / H 2 O 2 =26mol%. It results from a true experiment that accuracy of this optimization method is very high. The function S2-MGLY/MAA does not reach the value of 100mol%, but its real value is very close to that value. These chosen optimum conditions allow to restrict the amount of by-products, especially 2-methylglycerol, the presence of which leads to leaching of Ti from the framework of TS-1; hence the activity of TS-1 decreases. This problem is of crucial importance because the catalyst could be recovered from reaction mixture and reused in the process. A loss of activity in the subsequent epoxidations does not allow to keep the same condition of the epoxidation. The formation of polymeric products is also very restricted under these optimum conditions. From the point of view of the regeneration of catalyst, this problem is also important and the TS-1 catalyst could be used several times under the same conditions without a loss of the activity."
