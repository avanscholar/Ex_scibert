0,Introduction,"The production of biohydrogen catalyzed by microorganisms recovers and concentrates energy from residual organic sources. The applicability of hydrogen in industrial processes has constantly increased due to its high net calorific value (122 kJ g−1) and its various applications as starting material in the energy, chemical, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries (Lukajtis et al., 2018). These processes are suitable technologies for the production of decentralized energy in small facilities where biomass or organic waste is abundantly available, avoiding expenses and energy costs for transportation (Lee et al., 2011). (Lee et al., 2011). Bio-hydrogen has been obtained from biophotolysis and photo-decomposition using algae, cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria. However, through dark fermentation, in addition to obtaining hydrogen, there is the production of acetic, butyric, lactic, propionic acid, as well as solvents such as ethanol, methanol and acetone (Cai et al., 2011). The microorganisms involved in fermentative processes include facultative and/or mandatory anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium, Enterobacter, Ruminococcus, Bacillus and Escherichia. Over the last decades, there has been substantial development and improvement, both in yield as well as in the volumetric production of hydrogen. For large-scale applications, these parameters must considerably exceed the metabolic threshold of 4 mols H2.mol glucose. Various organic substrates, such as mono-, di- and polysaccharides, can be used as organic substrates and have different levels of hydrogen production per mols of substrate depending on the fermentation path and final products. Thus, most of the studies converge to the use of carbohydrates and pure strains (Lee et al., 2011; Elsharnouby et al., 2013; Maintinguer et al., 2017), however, solid agricultural biomass has been widely recognized as an important source of renewable energy, reducing the cost of producing the fuel from economically viable and accessible substrates (Gustavsson and Lee, 2016) . According to FAO (2011), banana is the most produced fruit worldwide, with 144 million tons. In Brazil, banana is the second most produced fruit (6.8 million tons harvested) corresponding to 16.7% of the total fruit volume (Andrade, 2017). According to Fernandes et al. (2013) for every tonne of bananas harvested, 100 kg of the fruit is discarded and about 4 tonnes of lignocellulosic waste is generated. In general terms, it is known that banana (Musa sp.) contains high organic material, which includes starch, residual sugars, mineral fractions and intermediate organic compounds formed in metabolic routes during the natural fermentation of the fruit, demonstrating that this biomass is easily biodegradable and is a feasible fermentation processes to produce energy in terms of biogas (Matheri et al., 2018). Investigations of fruit and vegetable waste fermentation for biohydrogen were concentrated mainly on fermentation in mixed culture (Lu et al., 2016; Alibardi and Cossu, 2016; Argun and Dao, 2016), thermophilic temperatures (Saidi et al., 2018; Abubackar et al., 2019) and with substrate pretreatment (Choonut et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2010). However, only limited studies have been carried out on the possible use of BW for hydrogen production at mesophilic temperature for hydrogen-producing autochthonous bacteria and without advanced pretreatment. The biohydrogen fermentation in pure culture has many advantages over mixed culture, once hydrogen is consumed by the consortia as it is produced, mainly by methanogenic archaea, acetogenic bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Lee et al., 2011), moreover, the use of isolated strains rather than bacterial consortium has contributed to higher H2 yields, avoiding deviation of metabolic pathways, substrate competition, and H2 uptake. Pretreatments which break down the lignocellulosic biomass, and make it easily hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars are a key step for complex substrates bioconversion (Kumar et al., 2015). An effective and economical pretreatment should use inexpensive chemicals, simple procedures and should preserve the utility of hemicelluloses and should evade the formation of fermentation inhibitors (Saratale et al., 2016). The banana waste is usually readily fermentable by microorganisms, dispensing the use of complex pre-treatments. Furthermore, the study in the production of biohydrogen from fruit wastes such as banana has been little explored, which makes this waste attractive and a focus of future research with the objective of making the most of the surplus vegetable biomass. The isolation and application of Bacillus sp. RM1 in the production of biohydrogen in a batch system was evaluated and discussed, focusing on the metabolic pathways of acidogenic systems using pure organic substrates (glucose, maltose, xylose and cellobiose) and lignocellulosic wastes (banana waste)."
1,Material and methods,
2,Strain isolation,"2.1 Strain isolation Banana Waste (BW) was collected from a fresh produce market in the city of São Carlos, Brazil. BW (pulp and peel) was crushed and passed through a 2 mm-mesh sieve. This extract was stirred and mixed in a flow profile mechanical stirrer containing chicane, transferred to plastic jars and stored at −20 °C. The inoculum source was BW indigenous microbiota, pre-cultivated in Duran® bottles (1 l working volume) at 37 °C and initial pH 5.9 (natural pH of BW) for 2 days under anaerobic conditions. The BW was used as the carbon source. This microbial consortium was used to isolate the hydrogen producing fermentative bacterial strain. The nutrient medium used for isolation and cultivation of H2-producing strains was prepared as follows: 10.0 g.L−1 glucose, 10.0 g.L−1 tryptone and 5.0 g.L−1 yeast extract. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH 50% (m/v) or HCl (Ho et al., 2012). The culture medium was sterilized using a filter membrane system 0.22 Millipore®. This system was pre-sterilized in an autoclave at 120 °C and 1 atm of pressure. The microbial consortium was submitted to serial dilutions (10−1-10−20) for the selection of the hydrogen producing bacteria. The suspension of the highest positive dilution was used for hydrogen growth and production to obtain isolated colonies in Petri dishes under the same conditions as the solid culture medium (Ho et al., 2012). The plates were incubated in a GasPack Jar with Anaerobac filter, Probac® and kept at 37 °C. The single colonies were collected with a strap platinum needle and suspended in bottles of 50 mL with nutrient medium, with 25 mL of reaction volume and 25 mL of headspace filled with N2 (100%). The bottles were incubated at 37 °C until the microbial growth. The cell growth of the isolated culture was quantified by the turbidity of the medium (OD600). The correlation curve was plotted to assess the degree of association between cell growth (OD600 nm) and cell dry mass (APHA, 2005). A culture sample was collected for phase-contrast microscopy observation or common light with a colored slide using the Olympus BX60-FLA microscope with Image Pro-Plus software."
3,Strain identification and phylogenetic analysis,"2.2 Strain identification and phylogenetic analysis DNA extraction of the 16S rRNA gene was performed by Purilink™ Microbiome DNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen). The DNA quality and concentration was measured by an ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis was used to verify the integrity of the fragment. A segment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified through PCR, using the set of primers 27F-1492R (Nubel et al., 1996) and GoTaq® Master Mixes (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and it was purified using Illustra GFX DNA PCR purification kit. The DNA fragment of 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Sanger method by ABI 3130 DNA Analyzer, 16 capillary DNA analysis system from Life Technologies – Applied Biosystems. The nucleotide sequences were processed to remove low quality bases, using SeqMan DNASTAR (Lasergene sequence analysis) software. The 16S rRNA sequences were compared to the Genbank Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Ribosomal Data Base Project (http://rdp.cme.smu.edu) for the approximation of phylogenetic identity. The genetic distance dendrogram was constructed using the MEGA version 7 software, with a bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates (Kumar et al., 2016a) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (LM643736.1) was used as Outgroup. The nucleotide sequence is available in the GenBank database under the accession number MH779470.1."
4,Batch fermentation assays for H2 production,"2.3 Batch fermentation assays for H2 production The parameters effect including carbon sources, cellobiose concentration and replacement of pure substrates by banana waste on hydrogen production were studied in batch assays using PCS medium (1.0 g.L−1 yeast extract; 5.0 g.L−1 CaCO3; 5.0 g.L−1 peptone, and 5.0 g.L−1 NaCl) by Haruta et al. (2002). To maintain the aseptic conditions, the PCS culture medium was sterilized using a filter membrane system 0.22 Millipore®. All batch assays were conducted in Duran® bottles (total volume of 250 mL and working volume of 150 L) inoculated (O.D600 equal to 0.4) with Bacillus sp. RM1 and initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH 50% (m/v) or HCl (P.A) at 37 °C. The bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas (100%) for 10 min and capped with butyl rubber stoppers. In the assay of carbon sources the following substrates (5 g.L−1) were glucose, xylose, starch, maltose, cellobiose, mannose, galactose, fructose and sucrose. The effect of the cellobiose concentration was conducted at various levels from 0.5 to 6.5 g.L−1. The banana waste (5.0 g total carbohydrates.L−1) was used as carbon source in the assays in batch reactors and culture medium (Haruta et al., 2002)."
5,Chemical and chromatographic analysis,"2.4 Chemical and chromatographic analysis The pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) and cellular growth, based on the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) and cell dry mass were performed following the protocol described by APHA (2005). The determination of total carbohydrates was performed by spectrophotometry according to Dubois et al. (1956). The biogas in the headspace was collected (0.5 mL) from each pressurized reactor with a pressure-lock gastight syringe and was assessed by gas chromatography (model GC-2010, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) with thermal conductivity detection (GC/TCD). The organic acids and ethanol were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV diode array detector (SPD-M10 AVP), a refraction index detector (RID-10 A), a CTO-20 A oven, an LC-10 ADVP Pump, an SCL 10 AVP control and column HPX-87H from Aminex (Penteado et al., 2013)."
6,Kinetic modeling,"2.5 Kinetic modeling The mean values of each anaerobic batch reactor were adjusted using the software package OriginPro 9.0. The data of the accumulated hydrogen production (Pac) was adjusted using the Gompertz equation, modified by Zwietering et al. (1990) (Equation (1)). (1) P a c = P × exp { − exp [ Rm × e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where: P ac is the cumulative hydrogen production (mmol.L−1); λ is the starting time for H2 production (h); P is the hydrogen production potential (mmol.L−1); Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mmol H2. L.h−1) and (Euler number) is the constant of 2.718281828. The specific growth (μ) obtained by experimental data on cell concentration (OD600) as a function of time was adjusted with polynomial curves, from which a set of X = f (t) values was obtained. The kinetic data generation time (Tg) data was calculated applying Eq. (2). (2) T g = l n 2 μ = 0,693 μ"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Strain isolation and characterization,"3.1 Strain isolation and characterization The isolated colony of the banana waste was circular in shape, opaque and smooth on the surface and edges. The rod-shaped cells were arranged alone or in pairs and/or trios. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated strain of banana was similar to Bacillus sp. with 100% similarity with the Database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/seqmatch) (Fig. 1 ). Bootstrap values (1000 replicate runs) are shown at the nodes (%). The scale bar indicates (0.10) the phylogenetic distance. Bacteria of the genus Bacillus are Gram-positive rod-shaped and are well known for their diverse applications, such as protein secretion, chemical synthesis, biopolymers, development of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals such as Chondroitin, Nacetylglucosamine and polygam-glutamic acid (Yim et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015; Mohapatra et al., 2017). In addition to these applications, some strains, including Bacillus macerans, Bacillus cloacae, Bacillus macerans, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus polymyxa have been reported to be efficient producers of hydrogen and organic acids (Lukajtis et al., 2018). The use of isolated strains has contributed to higher H2 yields from different lignocellulosic substrates, in addition to inferring in possible metabolic routes in the biotechnological process. The use of the microbial consortium is also relevant in terms of practical application, however, there is bacteria diversity and therefore, substrate competition and consumption of H2 by methanogenic archaea, acetogenic bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Lee et al., 2011). In addition, based on physiological understanding of a certain bacterium it is possible to proceed with its application in a bioaugmentation process (Kumar et al., 2016b) to obtain hydrogen from complex substrates such as BW (Gong et al., 2017). The Bacillus sp. RM1 strain was isolated in the presence of glucose, with generation time (Tg) and growth rate of 0.43 h and 1.60 h−1, respectively, from the growth curve shown in Fig. 2 (A) . Cell dry mass (CDM g.L−1) of the Bacillus sp. RM1 culture under isolation conditions was proportional to absorbance at 600 nm (A600 A600) and was calculated with the following ratio: CDM Bacillus sp. RM2 = 2.19 A600 (Fig. 2 B). The growth rate and cell dry mass concentration of 1.60 h−1 and 12.65 g.L−1, respectively, was higher when compared to the growth rate (0.16 h−1) and (8.5 g.L−1) obtained by Sakthiselvan and Madhumathi (2018) for Bacillus safensis EBT1 as inoculum in the fermentation of sugarcane bagasse, at 33 °C and pH 7.0."
9,Hydrogen production by bacillus sp. RM1,"3.2 Hydrogen production by bacillus sp. RM1 3.2.1 Effect of organic substrates The H2 production by Bacillus sp. RM1 was evaluated using various organic substrates including mono-, di-, and polysaccharide (Table 1 ). Among the monosaccharides (glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose and fructose) evaluated, the higher P (16.92 mmol H2.L−1 and 13.49 mmol H2.L−1) and YH2 (75.81 mL.g−1 carbohydrate added and 60.44 mL. g−1 carbohydrate added) were obtained from xylose and glucose respectively. The maximum stoichiometric amount of molecular hydrogen per mole of glucose is equal to 4 and 2 mol, when there is formation of acetic acid and butyric acid, respectively (Reaction 1 and 2) (Lukajtis et al., 2018). (1a) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 2 C H 3 C O O H + 4 H 2 (2a) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + C H 3 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 The xylose can be converted into hydrogen with a maximum yield of 3.33 mol-H2/mol-xylose when acetic acid is produced (reaction 3). Alternatively, xylose can be converted into hydrogen by butyric acid pathway as shown in reaction (4), with lower yield of 1.67 mol-H2/mol-xylose. (3) C 5 H 10 O 5 + 1.67 H 2 O → 1.67 C 2 H 3 O 2 − + 1.67 H + + 1.67 C O 2 + 3.33 H 2 (4) C 5 H 10 O 5 → 0.83 C 4 H 7 O 2 − + 0.83 H + + 1.67 C O 2 + 1.67 H 2 In the present research, fermentation from xylose and glucose resulted in 485.66 mg.L−1 and 546.94 mg.L−1 of acetic acid (HAc), respectively. It is known that HAc can serve as substrate for the production of other metabolites, such as ethanol (Reaction 5) and butyric acid (Reaction 6). The occurrence of reaction 5 and 6 can result in low H2 yield since HBu and ethanol can be produced instead of H2 from HAc. In the glucose assay, higher ethanol production (114.65 mg.L−1) was obtained when compared to the xylose assay (27.69 mg.L−1). From this, it can be inferred that the lower hydrogen yield (40.29 mL g−1 carbohydrate added) from glucose may be due to high ethanol production. (5) C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 → C H 3 C H 2 O H + 4 H 2 O (6) C H 3 C O O H + 2 C H 3 C H ( O H ) C O O H → H 2 + 3 2 C H 3 ( C H 2 ) 2 + C O O H + 2 C O 2 + H 2 O On the other hand, a slightly higher value was observed for butyric acid (622.56 mg.L−1) in xylose fermentation when compared to glucose (614.64 mg.L−1) (Table 1). In the presence of xylose, a higher YH2 of 50.53 mL g−1 carbohydrates added was observed in relation to glucose (50.53 mL.g− carbohydrates added). In addition, it was observed that the fermentation of glucose by Bacillus sp. RM1 resulted in a higher concentration of total volatile fatty acids (acetic and butyric acid) than in the xylose fermentation. The high concentration of volatile fatty acids may have caused inhibition of the hydrogenogenic biomass (Infantes et al., 2011). These effects on biomass can be related to inhibition caused by the permeability of non-dissociated acids through the cellular membrane. In this situation, and aiming to maintain the intracellular pH, the cells must spend metabolic energy to excrete these protons against a concentration gradient (Infantes et al., 2011). This active transport consumes energy, limiting the cells metabolism. The final pH value obtained in the xylose and glucose fermentation was 5.0 and 4.2. Therefore, the higher hydrogen yield from xylose than from glucose can be explained by the pH effect under the fermentation conditions of the last substrate. An et al. (2014) also reported higher hydrogen yields (91.9 mL H2.g−1) in xylose fermentation when compared to the yield of 80.3 mL H2.g−1 in glucose fermentation. In relation to the disaccharides (maltose, cellobiose and sucrose) the highest YH2 was obtained with maltose (53.01 mL H2.g−1 carbohydrates added) and cellobiose (48.02 mL H2.g−11 carbohydrates added). Maltose and cellobiose are obtained from the degradation of starch and cellulose, respectively, and with the same chemical properties, and their hydrolysis results in two glucose molecules, which justifies the similarity of H2 production. It is interesting that Bacillus sp. RM1 had higher efficiency in utilizing complex carbohydrates than monosaccharide glucose (40.29 mL H2.g−1 carbohydrates). The mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear; a reason might be osmotic pressure exerted by the different sugar molecules. The osmotic pressure of monosaccharide is higher than that of oligomeric polysaccharide when both molar mass were the same, when the higher osmotic pressure might show negative effect on hydrogen production (An et al., 2014). Moreover, the reason why the hydrogen yield was higher using maltose, xylose and cellobiose can be attributed to its dual nature in the metabolic pathway. Firstly, it serves as the sole source of carbon for cell growth and, secondly, it helps the enzymatic maturation during glycosylation, a process that accelerates the activity of microbial metabolism (Sinha and Pandey, 2014). The variation in the redox states of these sugar molecules can also be attributed to different hydrogen yield levels (Duangmanee et al., 2007). Maintinguer et al. (2017) also obtained hydrogen production from maltose (7.03 mmol.L−1) and starch (7.09 mmol.L−1) higher than glucose (6.78. mmol.L−1). Sinha and Pandey (2014) reported that among all substrates (glucose, arabinose, lactose, starch, molasses and bagasse hydrolysate) the maximum H2 production (22.58 mmol H2.L−1) was achieved using starch as the substrate. Therefore, H2 production by Bacillus sp. RM1 from starch (16.55 mmol.L−1) and maltose (17.75 mmol.L−1) was greater than glucose (13.49 mmol.L−1). The lower H2 production of 11.16 mmol.L−1 from sucrose when compared to maltose (17.75 mmol H2.L−1) and cellobiose (16.08 mmol H2.L−1), may be the result of low fructose uptake by Bacillus sp. RM1, since the hydrolysis of sucrose results in a glucose and fructose molecule. These results explain the low H2 yields of 11.26 mmol.L−1 in the assays using only fructose as carbon source. The H2 production of 16.55 mmol.L−1 from starch (polysaccharide) was similar to the production from cellobiose and maltose (disaccharide) and xylose (monosaccharide) (Table 1). An et al. (2014) also obtained maximal hydrogen yield of 125.9 and 91.9 mL g−1 carbohydrate added using fructose and xylose, respectively, as organic substrate from Clostridium beijerinckii YA001 isolated from cow manure. These results are higher to those obtained by Bacillus sp. RM1 using the monosaccharides fructose (33,62 mL.g−1 carbohydrate added) and glucose (40.29 mL.g−1 carbohydrate added). However, the hydrogen yield by Bacillus sp. RM1 using starch was 2.2 fold greater than that obtained by C. beijerinckii YA001. The acidic conditions established in fermentative processes, as verified at the end of all fermentations in this study, allows metabolic changes of biomass and allows the retention of protons (H+) to form smaller molecules, such as ethanol and propionic acid reducing the production of H2 (Infantes et al., 2011). It was observed that in all assays, there was accumulation of ethanol and organic acids at the end of the fermentation. The concomitant production of H2, ethanol and acetic acid during the fermentation process may have occurred via acetic acid/ethanol through acetogenesis, with ethanol conversion to acetic acid and H2 (Reaction 7). According to Saady (2013), acetogenic bacteria can synthesize acetic acid and produce H2 during heterotrophic growth from a variety of substrates, including ethanol. Bacillus species have been reported as possible acetogens by synthesizing ethanol and acetic acid from organic compounds (Sikora et al., 2013) justifying the results obtained in this research. Ethanol production occurred mainly from monosaccharides glucose (114, 65 mg.L−1) and mannose (96.99 mg.L−1). In contrast, low ethanol concentrations (14.74 mg.L−1) were obtained from starch (polysaccharide). It is probable that the complexity of starch molecule may have contributed to pathway deviation for organic acids production rather than ethanol. The effective ethanol production decreases the hydrogen production, since during ethanol formation there is no H2 production, but CO2 production (Reaction 8), justifying the low H2 production in the assay using mannose (10.81 mmol.L−1), where there was higher ethanol concentrations (96.99 mg.L−1) (Table 1). (7) C H 3 C H 2 O H + H 2 O → C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 (8) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 2 C H 3 C H 2 O H + 2 C O 2 The caproic acid production (HCa) was observed in the fermentation of all the different organic substrates evaluated. During fermentation leading to the HCa production, there is consumption of acetic acid as the main route. This biological reaction can occur by stretching the carboxyl chain of HAc and HBu with ethanol (Reaction 9 and 10), which is further reduced (Agler et al., 2012). In addition, the residual hydrogen itself (H2) in the liquid fraction may have been used as electron donor for the HCa formation from acetic and butyric acid (Reaction 11, 12 and 13) (Zhang et al., 2013). (9) 2 C H 3 C H 2 O H + C H 3 C O O H → C 6 H 11 C O O H + H 2 O (10) C H 3 C H 2 O H + C H 2 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H → C 6 H 11 C O O H + H 2 O (11) C H 3 C O O H + C H 2 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 H 2 + H + → C 6 H 11 C O O H + 2 H 2 O (12) C H 2 C H 2 C H 2 C O O H + 2 C O 2 + 6 H 2 → C 6 H 11 C O O H + 4 H 2 O (13) 3 C H 3 C O O H + 2 H + + 4 H 2 → C 6 H 11 C O O H + 4 H 2 O The highest HCa production (20.24 mg.L−1) was obtained from mannose (6C), while the lowest production (14.76 mg.L−1) was obtained from xylose (5C). It was observed that the higher the HCa production, the lower the hydrogen yield (Table 1). In this case, ethanol may have been used as electron donor for HBu and HCa production instead of H2 (Spirito et al., 2014). For the other hexoses, such as glucose, mannose, galactose and fructose, the HCa concentration ranged from 15.51 to 18.54 mg.L−1. These yields are similar to those obtained using maltose, cellobiose and sucrose; i.e., 12-carbon sugars (12C). The highest carbohydrate conversions were obtained in the assays with maltose (63.5%), glucose (61%) and cellobiose (49.5%), corresponding to the assays with higher hydrogen yields and production of acetic and butyric acid (Table 1). On the other hand, low substrate conversions were obtained in the assays using sucrose (28%), starch (28.5%), fructose (29%) and mainly mannose (10.5%). The high carbohydrate conversions in these assays may be due to the glucose consumption from maltose, cellobiose and sucrose degradation, while fructose consumption was reduced, leading to fructose accumulation and low substrate conversions. Therefore, Bacillus sp. RM1 demonstrated greater affinity in the degradation of glucose-containing substrates. Probably, the enzyme phosphatase maltose (MP) may have shown high activity during the period of exponential biomass growth, resulting in the hydrolysis of maltose into glucose and β-G-1-P (β glucose 1 phosphate), both of which can be converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by β-PGM (β-phosphoglucomutase) before entering glycolysis and/or used for UDP-glucose synthesis. In contrast, the need for the activation of associated enzymes in the conversion of fructose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by metabolic reactions and the low and high activity of α-phosphoglucomutase (α-PGM) and 6-phosphofructokinase (6-PFK), respectively, the fructose fermentation may have provided more fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) and consequently in F-1,6-P (Fructose 1,6 phosphate), which is not conducive to cell biosynthesis, due to the time it takes for this reaction to occur (Velasco et al., 2007). However, the accessibility of various carbon sources such as a substrate by Bacillus sp. RM1 for hydrogen and organic acids production reinforces the application of this strain in several types of carbohydrates degradation that are present in the renewable biomass. 3.2.2 Effect of cellobiose concentration Micro-organisms that metabolize cellobiose instead of glucose offer significant advantages in biotechnology, helping to unravel paradigms that involve the complete enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. Thus, among the carbohydrates tested, cellobiose was chosen to evaluate the effect its concentration has on the H2 and organic acids production from Bacillus sp. RM1 isolated from banana. Fig. 3 shows the growth of Bacillus sp. RM1 over time in the fermentation experiments conducted at different initial concentrations of cellobiose (0.5, 2.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 6.5 g.L−1). Generally, in the first hours of fermentation the bacteria consume the substrate for cell growth. It was observed that the lag phase time increased from 6 to 9 h for 0.5–6.5 g.L−1 of cellobiose. After the lag phase period, the exponential growth of Bacillus sp. RM1 began, obtaining higher growth rates (μ) of 2.5 and 2.7 h−1 in the assays with higher substrate concentration (5 and 6.5 g.L−1), when comparing the μmax of 0.9, 0.6 and 1.0 h−1 in the assays with lower concentrations, 0.5, 2.0 and 3.5 g.L−1, respectively. The μmax values obtained for Bacillus sp. RM1 are in the same order of magnitude as the μmax values reported for other H2 producing bacteria such as Clostridium. By way of example, for 6 g.L−1 glucose, an μmax obtained by C. beijerinckii NCIMB8052 (ATCC51743) and C. beijerinckii SA-1 (ATCC35702) were 0.32–0.29 h−1 and 0.23–0.2 h−1, respectively (Sandoval-Espinola et al., 2015). Yao et al. (2016) reported a higher μmax of 0.345 h−1 for C. acetobutylicum CICC 8012 cultured at glucose concentration 9-fold higher (60 g.L−1) than in the present study. The observed hydrogen production was 1.72 mmol.L−1, 18.77 mmol.L−1 and 17.25 mmol.L−1, respectively for 0.5 g.L−1, 3.5 g.L−1 and 6.5 g.L−1 of cellobiose. However, as shown in Table 2 , the averages followed by at least one letter in common do not differ by Tukey test, at the significance level of 5% probability (p < 0.05). Only in the assay with 0.5 g.L−1 of cellobiose a significant difference was observed in relation to the other tests by Tukey test. Therefore, in relation to H2 production, numerically, the highest production of 3.5 g.L−1 was observed, but did not differ statistically from the assays with 2.0, 5.0 and 6.5 g.L-1 of cellobiose, assuming that there was an increase in hydrogen production from 0.5 to 6.5 g.L−1. Similar to the present study, Eker and Sarp (2017) evaluated hydrogen production with different concentrations of paper waste, and observed an increase in H2 production from 3.84 to 45.5 g.L−1 of substrate. In this range, the highest accumulated hydrogen production (57.6 mmol.L−1) was obtained for 18.9 g.L−1 of paper waste. Song et al. (2013) observed an adverse effect; that is, decrease in H2 production from 253.8 to 107 mL from Bacillus sp. FS2011 for 5–30 g.L−1 of glucose. According to Yin and Wang (2016), the increase in substrate concentration may lead to increase in the hydrogen production; however, a much higher level of substrate concentration may affect bacterial activity. Carbohydrate conversion was almost complete (>90%) in the assay with 2 g.L−1 initial cellobiose concentrations. In the assays with cellobiose from 2.0 to 6.5 g.L−1 a reduced substrate conversion was observed from 93% to 60.8%, respectively. Yin and Wang (2016) also observed that increasing the initial substrate concentration (5 g.L−1 to 20 g.L−1) decreased substrate conversion from 95% to 55% in the H2 fermentation by Enterococcus faecium INET2. High initial substrate concentrations also provided increase in cell concentration, resulting in the accumulation of biomass and organic metabolites. The organic metabolites accumulation may have contributed to the quick stabilization of bacterial growth and H2 production, causing the substrate conversion to cease within the first 13 h of fermentation. There was an increase in YH2 from 51.37 to 126.93 mL.g−1 carbohydrate added for 0.5–2.0 g.L−1 of cellobiose, however for the assays with 2.0 g.L−1 to 3.5, 5.0 and 6.5 g.L−1, YH2 reduction to 80.08, 51.52 and 39.63 mL g−1 was observed, respectively. Rosa and Silva (2017) and Fonseca et al. (2018) also observed hydrogen yield decrease for higher carbon source concentration. These authors concluded that increasing substrate concentration favors the synthesis of organic acids, however, the acids accumulation can lead to decrease in pH and consequently the inhibition of fermentative biomass. This fact justifies the reduction of the initial pH value from 7 to values below 5.0 in the assays with higher cellobiose concentrations (2–6.5 g.L−1), while in the assay with lower concentration (0.5 g.L−1) the pH went from 7 to 6.7 (Table 2). Sharma and Li (2009) also observed decrease in pH from 5.5 to 3.5 and with 5.5 to 5.4 for 20 g.L−1 and 1 g.L−1 of glucose, respectively. Thus, it can be inferred that the increase in the substrate concentration directly influences the acidification process of the medium, establishing an inverse relation between the H2 yield and the substrate concentration. The decrease in the hydrogen yield with the increasing initial cellobiose concentration can also be justified by the partial H2 pressure exerted in the headspace, that is, the increase of the substrate concentration from 0.5 to 6.5 g.L−1 provided increase of about tenfold in the H2 production. The high H2 production in these assays may have contributed to the increase in H2 partial pressure by inhibiting the fermentation reactions, reflecting low hydrogen yields (Rosa and Silva, 2017). In the first 6 h of fermentation, little substrate was converted to organic acids corresponding to the low H2 production in the same period (Fig. 4 ). HAc and HBu were predominant after 9 h of fermentation, except in the assay with higher cellobiose concentration (6.5 g.L−1). The highest concentrations of HAc and HBu acids were obtained mainly with 2 and 3.5 g.L−1 of cellobiose, corresponding to the assays with higher H2 production and conversion carbohydrates. With the predominance of these acids in the assays, it is clear that hydrogen production process followed the acetic/butyric route. The butyric acid route is considered the main fermentation pathway for H2 production, in contrast to the production of propionic acid (Zhao et al., 2010). In this work, values below the detection limit of the chromatographic method were obtained for the propionic acid (<5 mg.L−1). This probably occurred due to the alteration of the metabolic route with the production of ethanol, acetic, butyric and caproic acid. According to Dareioti et al. (2014) the production of propionic acid is favored at pH higher than 7.0. The fermentations with Bacillus sp. were performed at initial pH 7.0. According to Fonseca et al. (2018), the onset of solventogenesis has been mainly correlated with the concentration of undissociated butyric acid in the medium at low pH values (<5.0). In this study, a maximum ethanol concentration of 117.19 mg.L−1 was obtained in the assay with 0.5 g.L−1 of cellobiose and low H2 production. Under these conditions, it can be inferred that at low substrate concentration the carbon flow was directed toward the alcohol production favoring the solventogenesis route, diverging from the results obtained by Ginkel et al. (2001), in which they obtained higher ethanol production and lower hydrogen yields in the assays with high substrate concentration."
10,Effect of banana waste as organic substrate,"3.3 Effect of banana waste as organic substrate The use of starch-rich raw material, which is readily hydrolyzed into simple carbohydrates, is particularly convenient for hydrogen production. Thus, the best organic substrate to be used should contain high contents of readily available carbohydrates. The banana waste contains high organic matter concentrations in the form of total suspended solids (108 g. TSS L−1) and soluble material (56 g. COD L−1), which allows to convert them into interesting metabolites such as H2 gas and organic acids (Table 3 ). Menezes et al. (2015) also characterized banana waste and observed COD (67 g.L−1) and TSS (122.8 g.L−1) values similar to those in the present study. According to Guo et al. (2010), high concentrations of organic matter in the substrate can result in higher biomass concentration and positive influence on the H2 production. The carbohydrate mixture that is present in banana waste can be favorable for hydrogen production, since it provides a variety of carbohydrates that can be fermented to H2 and organic acids by Bacillus sp. RM1. BW is rich in soluble carbohydrates (31 g.L−1), especially glucose (8 g.L−1) fructose (7 g.L−1) and sucrose (3 g.L−1) (Table 3). These sugars are due to degradation of the starch during fruit maturation, releasing glucose and fructose, which can be used for microbial metabolism (Doerflinger et al., 2015). Besides, autochthonous bacteria have greater adaptation capacity when its own vegetal biomass is used for its growth and metabolism, when compared to the application in other types of substrate (Lin et al., 2017). It was observed that the increase in H2 production occurred simultaneously with the growth of Bacillus sp. RM1 (Fig. 5 ). The maximum hydrogen yield (31.7 mmol H2.L−1) was obtained for the production rate (Rm) equal to 2.7 mmol H2.L−1.h. Similarly, Saidi et al. (2018) obtained total H2 production of 139 mmol.L−1 using fruit and vegetable wastes (tomato, potato, carrot, apple, pear and plum) as carbon and energy source. These authors also reported that the use of fruit and vegetable waste can substitute the components (CaCl2, MgCl2, yeast, KH2PO4 and K2HPO4) that are present in the culture media. The cell growth profile followed the same trend of H2 production, in which both had their maximum points after 20 h of fermentation. The reduced fermentation start time (λH2) of 3.9 h can be due to the use of biomass from the waste itself, allowing the rapid adaptation of the biomass to the substrate (WB). According to Lin et al. (2017), autochthonous bacteria have greater adaptation capacity when its own vegetal biomass is used for its growth and metabolism, when compared to the application in other types of substrate. The hydrogen YH2 yield (mL H2 g−1 1 carbohydrates added) in this study was calculated based on the initial total carbohydrate concentration contained in the BW in relation to the accumulated hydrogen production. The maximum YH2 was of 94.66 mL H2 g−1 carbohydrates added.. Feng et al. (2010) and Keskin et al. (2018) obtained similar YH2 of 101.08 mL H2 g−1 ST and 76 mL H2 g−1 SV, respectively, in the fermentation of apple waste and fruit and vegetable waste in batch reactors, initial pH 7.0 and bacterial consortium as inoculum (Table 4 ). The temperature is closely related to microbial metabolism, affecting the metabolic pathways related to the growth rate of the microorganism, substrate hydrolysis and hydrogen production rate (Elsharnouby et al., 2013). As in the present study, Kanchanasuta et al. (2017) and Mishra et al. (2017) evidenced that mesophilic conditions are ideal for H2 production using vegetal waste as carbon source. In addition, the use of isolated strains rather than bacterial consortium has contributed to higher YH2, avoiding metabolic pathway deviations, substrate competition, and H2 uptake. There were higher concentrations of organic acids and ethanol after 6 h of fermentation, corresponding to the exponential phase of cell growth and H2 production (Table 5 ). The highest concentrations of HAc (487.68 mg.L−1) and HBu (535.87 mg.L−1) were obtained at 24 and 10 h of fermentation, respectively, corresponding to the same period of higher production of H2 (Fig. 5). Ethanol increase was observed in the first 6 h of fermentation, which then gradually decreased until the end of fermentation. The ethanol was probably converted to acetic acid and H2 through acetogenesis and/or it may have been used as an electron donor for butyric and caproic acid production, as mentioned previously. There was gradual increase of the caproic acid production during the banana fermentation. Feng et al. (2010) also reported the H2 production coupled to the acetic, propionic, butyric acid and ethanol production in the apple bagasse fermentation. Nathoa et al. (2014) observed that the main fermentation product from banana peel was acetic acid, although ethanol and propionic acid were also observed at low concentrations during the H2 production route. Alibardi and Cossu (2016) reported the predominance of the butyric/acetic route for high carbohydrate content, reinforcing that the use of fruit waste in fermentative processes is an optimal alternative for obtaining by-products of biotechnological interest."
11,Conclusion,"1) Facultative anaerobic bacteria similar to Bacillus sp. was identified, with generation time (Tg) and growth rate of 0.43 h and 1.60 h−1, respectively, from glucose. 2) Among the pure organic substrates evaluated (glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, fructose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose and starch) the best H2 yield of 53.01 mL H2.g−1 carbohydrate added was obtained with disaccharide maltose. The minor hydrogen yield with monosaccharide mannose (32.28 mL H2.g−1 carbohydrate added) was observed. 3) In the assay using banana waste, maximum P and YH2 of 31.7 mmol.L−1 and 94.66 mL H2 g−1 carbohydrates added, respectively was obtained. 4) Higher initial concentrations of cellobiose (3.5–6.5 g.L−1) favored the H2 production, but decreased the H2 yield (80.08–39.63 mL H2.g−1 carbohydrate added) and substrate conversion (63.6–60.8%). 5) The metabolic pathway of hydrogen production by Bacillus sp. RM1 from banana waste was the acetic/butyric pathway with maximum production of 487.69 g HAc.L−1 and 535.88 g HBu.L−1 and ethanol (248.74 g.L−1)."
