0,Introduction,"The discovery of clean and efficient energy resources has an increasing trend due to the ever-increasing fossil fuel consumption and their negative effects on the environment. Hydrogen energy has become important as alternative clean energy due to its environmentally friendly performance and high energy density [1]. Chemical hydrides using NaBH4 with catalysts such as sepiolite clay with phosphoric acid treatment as support material [2], hydrochloric acid and acetic acid aqueous solution [3] , CoB doped acid modified zeolite ammonia borane [4] , hydroxyapatite-supported cobalt(0) nanoclusters [5] , Ru(0) nanoclusters [6]; NH3BH3 with catalysts such as copper–copper oxide nanoparticles [7] , γ-Al2O3 supported/Co-Cr-B[8] , Ruthenium(0) nanoparticles supported on multiwalled carbon nanotube [9] , polymer-immobilized palladium supported on TiO2 [10] and LiBH4 with catalysts such as nanoporous carbon ccaffolds [11] , SiO2-powder [12] , a porous Li3BO3 for enhanced hydrogen release are among the important chemical storage materials. Due to its high hydrogen capacity of 19.6% by weight, NH3BH3 is a leading candidate among potential candidates[10]. However, the experimental hydrogen yield of the catalytic hydrolysis of NH3BH3 is low due to the limited solubility in water and the amount of catalyst. Another potential candidate is LiBH4 with a high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 18.5% by weight. However, up to 60% by weight of the theoretical amount of hydrogen can be produced by LiBH4 hydrolysis [13,14]. Among these, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is considered to be in an ideal position due to its high hydrogen storage capacity of 10.8% by weight, non-toxicity, stable chemical properties and high purity hydrogen obtained[15,16]. However, the slow reaction kinetics of NaBH4 hydrolysis is a major problem. Due to low conversion efficiency at low ambient temperatures, slow reaction kinetics and low dissolution of NaBH4 in the water at temperatures below zero, new and alternative reaction paths are needed. H2 production from dehydrogenation of NaBH4 in methanol even at sub-zero temperatures has rapid reaction kinetics[17]. Equation 1 shows the methanolysis reaction of NaBH4. NaBH4 + 4CH3OH → NaB(OCH3)4 + 4H2 (1) In the literature, various homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been used to generate H2 from the methanolysis reaction of NaBH4 using systems such as natural microgranular cellulose[17] , boric acid [18] , methanol, water, and their mixtures[19] , and pyridinium-based polymeric ionic liquids[20] . Many of the previous studies have shown that precious metal catalysts exhibit remarkable activity in catalysing the hydrolysis of NaBH4. However, the high cost of metal catalysts and their limited abundance in nature makes them difficult to use for large-scale applications [6,21,22]. Recently, different reactions can be catalysed appropriately with metal-free carbon materials, which will greatly reduce the cost [23]. Carbon-based materials have an important place in the production of metal-free catalysts with their superiority such as good conductivity, structure diversity, and superior mechanical properties. However, it is not preferred to be used directly in catalysis reactions since the active species on carbon materials are not at the desired level[24]. Heteroatom-doped metal-free carbon materials have attracted considerable attention as new heterogeneous catalysts such as graphene nanoshell/carbon nanofibers[25], N-doped carbon supported Ru[26], nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes-supported nanoparticles[27], N-doped porous carbon nanosheets[28], hydrophilic nitrogen-doped carbon dots [29]. The method of doping of heteroatoms provides additional heteroatom-containing active species to carbon materials. There are significant efforts to achieve effective catalytic performances by improving the electronic and electro catalytic behaviour of carbon material. The electronic and optical properties of carbon can be improved by the doping of electron-rich heteroatoms with carbon and can be used in many fields such as catalysis, energy, and optics. In improving catalytic activity, carbon-based catalysts doped with various heteroatoms such as N, S, P and B that increase active sites by modulating electronic properties are efficient and promising because of doped heteroatom materials[30–35] such as P-doped carbon fibers[30], N,P-co doped carbon networks[31], N-doped porous carbon[32], silk gel-based N self-doped porous activated carbon[33], N-doped carbon[34], N-doped activated carbon[35]. In the literature, the most commonly used atom to add carbon materials is nitrogen for applications such as electrochemical capacitor performance[36], supercapacitor[37], enhanced hydrogen production [38], CO2 adsorption[39]. However, due to their different electronegativity and atomic sizes from carbon, the S and P atom doping, which can alter the charge density of carbon and cause structural distortion, can also create a significant synergistic effect in improving catalytic performance in visible light photo activity[40], converting pitch into porous carbon[41],bioelectricity production[42]. Having the same valence electron configuration as nitrogen, the phosphorus atom has a lower electronegativity than nitrogen and carbon atoms. In particular, in catalytic reactions, phosphorus-containing functional groups and strong acid properties of phosphorus are effective in the electrical properties and chemical reactivity of the relevant materials when they are doped into carbon[43].Besides, one of the beneficial effects on the carbon structure after P doping is the formation of defects[44]. These defects may contribute to the enhancement of electron delocalization due to the good electron-donating properties of the phosphorus atom [45]. Also, the addition of sulphur to carbon materials other than the phosphorus atom has been attracting attention recently. The improvement in the catalytic activity of carbon materials with the addition of sulphur can be attributed either to an increase in the number of defects that can act as catalytic sites or to activation of neighbouring carbon atoms due to the increase in load or rotational densities caused by sulphur species. In this case, oxidized sulphur is preferred to design the high activity material[43].Microalgae are one of the raw materials used in different fields and structurally containing proteins, lipids and polysaccharides [46]. Spirulina Plasentis, which is in the microalgae group, has a rich structure in terms of nitrogen functional groups [47]. Microalgae production is increasing rapidly in the world. Here, the synthesis of sulphur and phosphorus doped metal-free carbon catalysts was carried out as a result of the two-step modification of the carbon sample based on Spirulina Plasentis microalgae obtained by activation of KOH in CO2 atmosphere. The efficient H2 production from NaBH4 methanolysis with the metal-free catalyst was investigated. S and P doped metal free catalysts were characterized by XPS, XRD, SEM, FTIR, and BET analysis methods. In these NaBH4 methanolysis H2 release experiments, NaBH4 effect, catalyst loading effect, temperature and reuse parameters were studied."
1,Experimental section,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation In this study, firstly, activated carbon was obtained from an ashing furnace at 600° C from KOH activation with Spirulina Platensis microalgae (5 g) at a ratio of 1:1 under CO2 atmosphere. The activation was carried out for 30 min at a heating rate of 10° C min -1. Then, in the second step, the obtained activated carbon S-KOH sample was impregnated with sulphuric acid diluted 1:3 with distilled water. The sulphuric acid modification was carried out in an oven at 100 °C by hydrothermal treatment overnight. Thus, both the surface properties of the S-KOH sample were improved and sulphur was added to the structure. In the third step, the obtained S-doped S-KOH sample was impregnated with distilled water with phosphoric acid diluted 1:3. The phosphoric acid modification was carried out by hydrothermal treatment in an oven at 100 °C overnight. Thus, P was added to the S doped S-KOH sample. The metal-free carbon sample with S and P additives was washed with hot and cold distilled water. Finally, this material was dried at 80 °C for 6 h and then stored."
3,Sample characterization,"2.2 Sample characterization X-ray diffraction (Rigaku 19 D/Max-2500/PC instrument, Cu Ka radiation) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° was performed for the crystalline properties of S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P catalysts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4300, and Japan) under 10 kV was used for the surface morphologies of S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalysts. The specific surface area of the S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P samples was determined using an adsorption device (Model 2010, Micrometrics, USA) at −196° C. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe X-Ray photoelectron spectrometer with monochromatic Al Ka radiation was used. The surface functional groups of S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P samples were characterized by an FTIR spectrometer (FT-IR, Nicolet IS10) in the range of 4000–500 cm− 1. Transmissionelectronmicroscopy(TEM)analysiswas performed usingJEOL"

5,Performance of the catalysts,"3.1 Performance of the catalysts The water displacement method was used for hydrogen production induced by the S and P doped metal-free carbon-based catalyst resulting from NaBH4 methanolysis. 2.5% NaBH4 (0.25 g) and 10 mg of catalyst were added to a round bottom reactor flask. Subsequently, hydrogen formation occurred after 10 mL of methanol solution was added to this reaction flask at 30° C via syringe. The volume of hydrogen obtained was recorded at regular intervals. The H2 production rate (HGR) was defined as mL min−1 g−1."
6,Reusability,"3.2 Reusability Reusability studies were carried out for the S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst. For this purpose, 50 mg of S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst and 0.0965 g of NaBH4 were transferred to a round bottom reaction flask. Subsequently, 20 mL of methanol was quickly transferred to this reaction flask. The volume of H2 produced as a result of this methanolysis reaction was recorded at regular intervals until it was completed. After this reaction was completed, 0.0965 g of NaBH4 was transferred back to the reaction flask. Again, the volume of hydrogen obtained periodically was recorded. This process was repeated 5 times in a row."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of metal-free catalysts,"4.1 Characterization of metal-free catalysts Fig. 1 shows the SEM micrographs for S-KOH (a, b), S-KOH-S (c, d) and S-KOH-S-P (e, f) metal-free catalysts. Activated carbon produced by KOH activation has well-formed pores and a heterogeneous surface. As a result of KOH activation, the outer surface of the S-KOH sample is covered with highly irregular voids. There are large amounts of slit-shaped pores on the surface. After S addition to the S-KOH activated carbon sample, the sample pore structure became more developed, more regular, and more fragments were observed. After the S doping, the surface of the S-KOH sample promoted the formation of a more microporous structure. SEM images reveal that the addition of sulphur can increase the porous structure. The surface properties of the S-KOH-S sample resulted in different changes after the P doping. In the S-KOH-S sample, there are more fragments bonded together after P doping and a rough surface. It is clear that the phosphorus nanoparticles are more dispersed on S-KOH-S and thus prevent aggregation. The surface area, pore volume and pore size of the S-KOH, S-KOH-S and S-KOH-S-P samples are shown in Table 1 . After the sulphur modification, the surface area of S-AC increased significantly from 26.54 to 453.89 m2g−1 by about 20 times. However, after P doping, the surface area of S-KOH-S decreased from 453,891 to 178.58 m2g−1. S-KOH-S-P has a lower surface area than S-KOH-S. This is because the phosphorus particles are loaded onto the S-KOH-S surface and block the holes on its surface. These results were consistent with the observations of SEM images. From the surface area results, it is clear that the S and P atom doping significantly affects the surface structure of the activated carbon. Table 1 shows that the pore sizes of the S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalysts are between 1.56 and 1.86 nm. After S doping on S-KOH, pore size decreased from 1.86 nm to 1.65 nm and after P doping on S-KOH-S the pore size decreased from 1.65 nm to 1.56 nm. The values not exceeding 2 nm according to IUPAC pore size classification. it is considered to be microporous. In this study, all of the samples produced are microporous. The surface areas obtained after the pyrolysis of Spirulina residues at 400, 700 and 900 °C and after the pyrolysis at 900 °C with 5 M hydrochloric acid were found to be 67.00, 88.60, 117.90 and 370.10 m2/g, respectively [48]. In another study, the surface area obtained from Spirulina platensis microalgae by pyrolysis at 450° C was found to be 167 m2/g [49]. In another study, surface area of 2.63 m2/g was obtained for activated carbon based on Spirulina platensis microalgae at 750 °C [50]. Based on these results in the literature, surface area of 453.89 m2/g obtained from Spirulina platensis micro algae treated with H2SO4 after KOH activation is quite ideal in this study. The XRD patterns of S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P are shown in Fig. 2 . An amorphous structure was evident in the XRD spectrum for S-KOH. The XRD spectrum for S-KOH-S shows diffraction peaks that correspond well with standard orthorhombic sulphur phase values (JCPDS no. 08–0247). The diffraction peaks of crystalline sulphur disappeared after the P atom contribution. Only amorphous carbon was detected in the XRD spectrum for S-AC-S-P. This means that the P atom contribution mainly affects the organic components of S-KOH-S. Thus, it shows that the P atom contribution has a great influence on the structure of carbon hollow spheres. Fig. 3 a and 3b show the FTIR spectrum of raw microalgae, S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P in the 400–4000 cm -1 and 400–2000 cm -1. The FTIR spectrum of raw algae shows a weak band belonging to the OH stretch vibration at about 3700 cm−1. A peak of CC (alkynes) stretching vibration appeared around 2300 cm -1. The peak CO at approximately 1540 cm−1 can be defined as the stretching vibration. A band was observed at 1050 cm−1 belonging to the C - O - C, C - O groups. For S-KOH, it can be attributed to O H stretching vibrations extracted from broadband alcohols and absorbed water observed at 3600–3100 cm−1. For S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P, an increase in densities of asymmetric (2980 cm−1) and symmetrical C H tension bands (2900 cm−1) were obtained. Probably highly conjugated carbonyls, overlapping bands of C = C and C = N stretching vibrations were seen at 1605–1535 cm−1. The band of groups C - O - C, C - O was obtained at 1065 cm−1. After the contribution of S and P atoms to the S-KOH structure, there are new peaks and increases in the intensity of S-KOH peaks. As can be seen from the FTIR spectra for S-KOH-S, the two peaks at 1165 cm−1 and 1089 cm−1 can be assigned to O = S = O stretching vibration caused by some oxidized sulphur. S-doped porous carbon samples also show absorption bands from the carbon frame at 883 and 639 cm−1. In S-KOH-S-P, the peak ionized P + –O − or P - O - C binding at 1109 cm−1 can be assigned [51,52]. The contribution of P in S-KOH-S-P can be confirmed by P-C vibration bands at 713 and 688 cm−1 [53]. In all metal-free catalysts, tensile vibrations of functional groups in the combination of carbon and oxygen can be seen in the range 1000 cm−1 to 1700 cm−1 [54]. The surface chemistry of XPS and S-KOH-S and S-KOH-S-P was also analysed. Fig. 4 shows the full scan XPS spectrum of S-KOH-S and S-KOH-S-P. In the XPS spectrum for S-KOH-S, four distinct peaks at 283, 531, 398 and 167 eV correspond to C 1 s, O 1 s, N 1 s and S 2p, respectively. The peak at 167 eV indicates successful doping of S in S-KOH-S as prepared. According to the XPS results, 1.08% by weight of sulphur was obtained in S-KOH-S. Fig. 5 a, b, c shows the deconvolution results of core energy level spectra C 1 s, O 1 s, and S 2p for S-KOH-S. S doping is important as more active catalytic regions with positive charge density or rotation density are obtained that provide better metallic properties in the oxygen reduction reaction[55,56]. In S-KOH-S, peaks occur for sp2 C - C at 283.29 eV, C - O or C - S at 284.46 eV and O = C - O at 288.90 eV for spectra of C1s. has been released. O1s spectra for S-KOH-S are a low energy strong peak representing a metal-oxide peak in the oxide lattice without oxygen gap at 530.04 eV, a metal oxide peak in the oxide lattice with oxygen gap at 531.68 eV and at 533.27 eV a metal-hydroxide peak was obtained. The S 2p spectrum of S-KOH-S shows two peaks centred at 167.39 and 169.70 eV depending on the oxidized S. For S-KOH-S-P, C1s at 284.46 eV, N 1 s at 399.46 eV, O 1 s at 533.46 eV and P2p peaks at 133.46 eV are seen. In detail, the C1s spectrum in S-KOH-S-P (Fig. 5d) is deconvoluted into three single peaks at 282.86, 284.32 and 288.12 eV. These peaks are assigned to the sp2 graphitic carbon, C-O (phenolic, alcoholic, etheric) and carbon in the carbonyl and carboxylic groups, respectively. These results are consistent with the results of FTIR analysis. The O1s spectrum is deconvoluted to three peaks at 530.07, 531.64 and 533.20 eV (Fig. 6 e). The peak at 530.07 eV attributed to oxygen double bonded to carbon (CO) and bridged oxygen in the phosphate group (PO)[57]. The peak at 531.64 eV was assigned to the combined effects of single-bonded oxygen (–O–) in the C - O and C - O-P groups. The P2p spectrum (Fig. 5f) is deconvoluted into two different components at 130.9 and 132.66 eV. The energy of P of 130.9 eV corresponds to elemental phosphorus[58], ie the P P bond. The peak at 132.66 eV is attributed to O-PO[59]."
9,Catalytic activities of metal-free catalysts,"4.2 Catalytic activities of metal-free catalysts The catalytic activity was evaluated by combining 20 mg catalyst of 2.5 wt% NaBH4 with 10 mL of methanol solution to measure the amount of H2 produced by S-KOH, S-KOH-S and S-KOH-SP by methanolysis (Fig. 6). Theoretical yields of hydrogen (665 mL) for S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalysts were achieved in 780, 420 and 140 s, respectively. HGRs for S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalysts were 2461, 4571, and 13714 mL min−1 g−1, respectively. The S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst gave the highest HG ratio, five times greater than that obtained with the S-KOH catalyst, and this shows excellent catalytic performance due to the addition of P and S atoms. In addition, the catalytic activity of the S-KOH-S catalyst is 1.8 times higher than that of S-KOH. The synergistic coupling effects of the two heteroatoms can explain these developments. In recent years, heteroatom doping has been reported to improve the optical and electronic properties of carbon nanomaterials. Non-metal heteroatom doping such as P and S is recognized as an effective method to promote the electrocatalytic performance of carbon atoms[60]. The influence of doping atoms on the properties of carbon materials is related to three properties: the number of electrons in the outer shell, electronegativity and size. There is a difference in electronegativity between carbon and phosphorus atoms. Carbon materials doped with different electronegative atoms such as P atom (electronegativity of phosphorus: 2.19,) and S atom (electronegativity of sulphur: 2.58) (electronegativity of carbon: 2.55) showed significant catalytic activity[61]. The activity of these doped metal-free carbons may be related to the deterioration of the homogeneity of the charge distribution of the material. Phosphorus tends to donate electrons to carbon due to its electronegativity. If there is direct attachment to carbon, a positive charge will be created on phosphorus instead of carbon. However, the electronegativities of S and C are quite similar. Therefore, the high activity exhibited by the S-KOH-S catalyst compared to the S-KOH catalyst cannot be attributed to the deterioration of the charging uniformity. There is an increasing spin density on carbon atoms with S doping[62]. The following reaction steps for the NaBH4 methanolysis can be written. S t e p 1 N a B H 4 ↔ Na + + BH 4 - S t e p 2 B H 4 - + H + ↔ BH 3 + H 2 S t e p 3 B H 3 + 3 CH 3 O H → B CH 3 O 3 + 3 H 2 S t e p 4 B CH 3 O 3 + CH 3 O H ↔ B CH 3 O 4 - + H + S t e p 5 4 B CH 3 O 4 - + 2 H + + 7 H 2 O ↔ B 4 O 7 2 - + 16 CH 3 O H Methanol molecules dissociate on the surface of S-KOH-S and S-KOH-S-P. BH4 - and CH3OH reactants can be adsorbed on the metal-free catalyst. With Lewis base and acid regions, it is possible to combine the S, P doped metal-free carbon with the protic H atom from CH3OH and the hydridic H atom of NaBH4 in H2 production[63]. The H- ions in BH4 - are transferred onto the heteroatom. As a result, hydrogen atoms acquire an electron from the heteroatom. Thus, the hydridic H atom occurs in the methanolysis reaction. Besides, BH3 is bound to the heteroatom used. The H- ions then react with the methanol to form H2 –. The CH3O– ions in the solution react with boron in BH3. Thus, BH3 (CH3O)- ions occur in the reaction. Again, H- is transferred from the BH3(CH3O)- ions to the adjacent heteroatom[64].Acting as a Lewis acid region in S-KOH-S-P, P atoms promote the adsorption of CH3O– ions, which then react with BH3 to form BH3 (CH3O)-. Therefore, these Lewis pairs that can activate H2 are potential catalysts for the release of H2 from NaBH4.Here, the P atom can act as a Lewis acid species [65]. Thus, the absorption of Lewis bases such as CH3O-ions may occur more rapidly. This is in favour of the reaction kinetics [66]. H2 production volumes from NaBH4 methanolysis with 10 mg S-KOH-S-P catalyst at NaBH4 concentrations of 1%(0.1 g), 2.5%(0.25 g), 5%(0.5 g), and 7.5%(0.75 g) 30° C are given in Fig. 7 . The maximum HGRs of 8250, 18571, 20,153 and 17454 mL min−1 g−1 were obtained with 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% NaBH4, respectively. There is a two-fold increase in HGR values with an increase from 1% to 5% of NaBH4 concentration. However, the HGR achieved by increasing the NaBH4 concentration from 5% to 7.5% was reduced. The H2 release produced depending on the viscosity of the reaction system by increasing the NaBH4 concentration to 5% slows down due to tetramethoxy borate as a byproduct of the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction blocking the catalyst surface. Thus, mass transfer processes of the reactants and catalysts are prevented [67]. A series of experiments were carried out by varying the amount of S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst added from 5 mg to 20 mg in 2.5% by weight NaBH4 at 30° C (Fig. 8 ). HGRs for 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg catalyst amounts were 23636, 18571, 17,533 and 13928 mL min−1 g−1, respectively. Completion times for the 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg catalyst amounts were 330, 210, 150 and 140 s. It is noteworthy that under the same reaction conditions, the production rate of H2 is faster by increasing the amount of catalyst. The catalytic activity of S-KOH-S-P in methanolysis of NaBH4 with three different temperatures (20, 30, 40, and 50 °C) was investigated. Fig. 9 shows the H2 production volumes as a function of time in the presence of 10 mg of S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst. The reaction times for 30, 40 and 50 °C are 360, 210, 160 and 130 s, respectively. HGR values for 20, 30, 40 and 50° C were calculated as 10833, 18571, 24,375 and 26,000 mLmin−1 g−1, respectively. The rate of reaction was accelerated with increasing reaction temperatures, as expected. For NaBH4 methanolysis catalysed by S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst, Ea was obtained by using the Arrhenius equation. According to the Arrhenius equation shown in Equation 7, the Ea was found to be 12.54 kJ mol−1. lnK = lnA − Ea / RT (7) where represents K; HGR, Ea; activation energy (kJ mol−1), A; exponential factor, T (K), temperature, R ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1). The comparison of HGR and Ea of S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst with the previous studies are given in Table 2 [17,68–79]. Fig. 10 shows the changes in the HG ratio over the reuse cycles of S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst. As shown in Fig. 11 , the S-KOH-S-P catalyst produced almost the same amount of H2 (665 mL) after five uses, showing 100% conversion for each cycle in the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction. At the same time, the S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst retained 46% of its original activity even after 5 cycles. After the third recycle test, SEM and TEM images of S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst are given in Fig. 11 (a) and (b) and Fig. 12 (a) and (b), respectively. S-KOH-S-P exhibits a rough surface with various pores in the different micrometer range (Fig. 1e and f). As shown in the SEM image in Fig. 11a and 11b, the particles were collected as micro-scale aggregates. Also, the particles completely cover the surface of the carbon. It is observed that the metal-free carbon composite maintained its excellent stability without obvious damage after the third recycle test. Also, TEM images of S-KOH-S-P particles given in Fig. 12 (b) confirm the aggregation of catalyst particles."
10,Conclusions,"Here, the S and P-doped metal-free carbon catalyst synthesis including KOH activation of Spirulina Platensis microalgae is reported for the first time. These catalysts were used for the H2 production from the NaBH4 methanolysis. HGR value obtained for the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction for 5 mg S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalysts was 23636 mL min−1 g−1. The S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalyst gave the highest HG ratio, five times greater than that obtained with the S-KOH catalyst, and this shows excellent catalytic performance due to the addition of P and S atoms. S-KOH, S-KOH-S, and S-KOH-S-P metal-free catalysts were analysed by XPS, SEM, XRD, FTIR, and BET analysis. In particular, XPS, FTIR and SEM analysis results showed that there are important changes in the sample surface. According to the XPS results, 1.08% by weight of sulphur was obtained in S-KOH-S. After the sulphur modification, the surface area of S-AC increased significantly from 26.54 to 453.89 m2g−1 by about 20 times. Ea value for S-KOH-S-P was calculated to be 12.54 kJ mol−1. These reusable and environmentally friendly metal-free catalysts can be considered as alternative materials for the production of H2 from NaBH4 methanolysis."
