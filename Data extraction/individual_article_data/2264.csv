0,Introduction,"Reforming of biomass-derived compounds in aqueous phase (APR) is a promising technology to produce bio-hydrogen, a renewable energetic carrier that is also used for producing valuable chemicals [1,2]. The APR process was introduced by Dumesic’s group in 2002 aiming the production of hydrogen from polyols, sugars and sugar alcohols obtained from lignocellulosic biomass [3]. The process generates hydrogen with low amounts of CO in a single reactor at low temperatures (423 K–543K) and moderate pressures (15–40bar), which avoids the costs of water vaporization and favors the purification of the hydrogen effluent stream [4,5]. The production of bio-hydrogen was initially investigated for APR of polyols with shorter carbon chains such as ethylene glycol and glycerol [6–9]. Then, the APR of larger sugar alcohols (sorbitol, xylitol) and sugars (glucose) were also studied [10–14]. The conversion of biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons to hydrogen is characterized by a complex chemistry, especially as the size of the substrate increases. The direct reaction pathway to produce H2 via APR of polyols involves the CC as well as CH and OH bond scissions on the catalyst surface to form adsorbed CO that consecutively yields CO2 and H2 via the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. As an example, Fig. 1 shows a simplified scheme accounting for the production of hydrogen via the APR of glycerol. For a polyol containing n carbon atoms (polyol Pn) the APR reaction pathway involves the initial reactant decarbonylation (reaction 1) followed by the WGS reaction (reaction 2). The formation stoichiometry of H2 and CO2 from polyol Pn is represented by reaction 3: (1) CnOnH2n+2 →n CO+(n+1) H2 (2) n CO+n H2O→n CO2 +n H2 (3) CnOnH2n+2 +n H2O→n CO2 +(2n+1) H2 Significant formation of byproducts may occur in the APR of polyols, in particular via parallel reactions involving cleavage of CO bonds that leads to formation of side products such as alkanes and alcohols [11,15]. In the gas phase, formation of methane by hydrogenation of CO and CO2 is also an undesired side reaction. Development of catalysts that selectively promote the CC bond cleavage and water-gas shift reaction is therefore a requisite for efficiently generating H2 from APR of polyols. Platinum supported on alumina or carbon has been widely employed for the APR reaction [3,9,10,13,16]. In this regard, previous studies have shown that Pt is more selective than other metals [17] and that the moderate acidity of alumina or carbon does not favor the undesired acid catalyzed dehydration of the substrate to liquid products [18]. Platinum is a high-priced metal of limited availability and is therefore important to determine the optimal Pt content required to achieve the highest H2 productivity. However, very few studies addressing the relationship between the Pt loading and the H2 productivity for APR of polyols on Pt-supported catalysts have been reported. In particular, no reports were published so far on the effect of Pt content on the formation of coke and catalyst deactivation in aqueous phase reforming of polyols. The structure sensitivity of the APR of glycerol and ethylene glycol was investigated by varying the Pt particle size on platinum supported on alumina or carbon [8,19,20]. Recently, we used Pt/Al2O3 catalysts containing different %Pt to investigate the effect of the Pt content on the production of H2 for the APR of sorbitol [21]. Here, we have extended these studies on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts to stablish and compare the effect of Pt surface concentration on the catalyst activity, selectivity and stability for the APR of ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (Gly), xylitol (Xyl) and sorbitol (Sorb). Results show that at a given space velocity, the H2 yield and productivity as well as the amount of coke formed on the catalyst depend essentially on the Pt surface concentration and the polyol size."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Four Pt/Al2O3 catalysts containing different Pt contents were prepared and are identified here as catalysts I (0.30 Pt%), II (0.57 Pt%), III (1.50 Pt%) and IV (2.77 Pt%). All the catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation at 303K of a high-purity γ-Al2O3 powder (Cyanamid Ketjen CK300) with an aqueous solution of tetraamine platinum nitrate, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Aldrich, 99.99%). The CK300 alumina had BET surface area of 220m2/g, pore volume of 0.49cm3/g and contains 50ppm sulfur. The impregnated alumina was dried overnight at 353K, then heated in air at 773K for 3h and finally reduced 2h at 773K in pure hydrogen. Specific surface areas (Sg, m2/g) were measured by N2 physisorption at its boiling point using a Autosorb Quantochrome Instrument 1-C sorptometer and BET analysis methods. Prior to N2 physisorption, the samples were outgassed for 1h at 623K. The Pt content of the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), using a Perkin–Elmer Optima 2100 unit. The Pt dispersion (DPt, surface Pt atoms/total Pt atoms) of the samples was determined by hydrogen chemisorption, using the double isotherm method as described in [22]. The volumetric adsorption experiments were performed in a conventional vacuum apparatus. Catalysts were reduced in H2 at 673K for 1h and then outgassed 2h at 673K. After cooling to room temperature, a first isotherm was drawn for measuring the total H2 uptake. Then, and after 1h of evacuation at room temperature, a second isotherm was performed to determine the amount of weakly adsorbed hydrogen. The amount of irreversibly held hydrogen, (HC)i, was calculated as the difference between total and weakly adsorbed hydrogen. The pressure range was 0–7kPa and extrapolation to zero pressure was used as a measure of the H2 uptake on the metal. A stoichiometric atomic ratio of H/Pt=1 was used to determine the metal dispersion. Mean Pt crystallite sizes ( d ¯ Pt, nm) were determined from H2 chemisorption data by using site densities of 1.12×1015 sites per cm2 of metal [23]. Catalysts III and IV were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 100 CX II microscope with an acceleration voltage of 100KV and magnification of 450,000x. A significant number of Pt particles was observed to obtain reliable particle size distribution histograms. The average volume/area diameter of Pt crystallites (dVA, nm) was calculated from d V A = ∑ n i d i 3 ∑ n i d i 2 , where ni is the number of Pt particles of size di. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected on a Shimadzu XD-D1 diffractometer using nickel filtered CuKα radiation. The acid properties of alumina support were determined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 preadsorbed at 373K. Samples were pretreated in He at 773K for 1.5h and then exposed at 373K to a flow of 1% NH3/He for 40min. Weakly adsorbed NH3 was removed by flushing with He at 373K for 0.5h and then the temperature was increased at 10K/min. The NH3 concentration in the effluent was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) in a Baltzers Omnistar unit. The nature of surface acid sites on alumina was determined by Fourier infrared transform spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed pyridine using a Shimadzu FTIR–8101M spectrophotometer. Samples were ground to a fine powder and pressed into wafers (20–40mg). The discs were mounted in a quartz sample holder and transferred to an inverted T-shaped Pyrex cell equipped with CaF2 windows. Samples were initially outgassed in vacuum at 723K during 2h and then a background spectrum was recorded after being cooled down to room temperature. Spectra were recorded at room temperature, after admission of pyridine, and degassing at 373K. The amounts of carbon formed on the catalysts during the catalytic tests were measured by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Samples (50mg) were heated in a 2% O2/N2 stream at 10K/min from room temperature to 1073K. The evolved CO2 was converted to methane by means of a methanation catalyst (Ni/kieselghur) operating at 673K and monitored using a flame ionization detector in an SRI 8610C gas chromatograph."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests Catalytic tests for the APR of EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb were carried out in a continuous packed-bed reactor at 498K and 29.3bar using aqueous solutions containing 1%wt polyol. Catalysts were sieved to retain particles with 0.35-0.42mm diameter for catalytic measurements and reduced in hydrogen at 573K for 1h before reaction. The 1%wt polyol solution was introduced to the reactor in a N2 carrier flow (20cm3/min) using a HPLC-type pump (Alltech 310) and pressurized to setpoint. The reactor effluent was cooled down by passing through a condensation system and then conducted to a gas-liquid separator. A Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a Hayesep D 100–120 column (5m x 1/8 in x 2.1mm), and thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization (FID) detectors was used to analyze on line the gaseous products. Hydrogen was quantified using the TCD detector while CO, CO2 and CH4 were analyzed by FID after completely converting CO and CO2 to methane by means of a methanation catalyst (Ni/Kieselghur) operating at 673K. Condensable products were drained periodically and quantified by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a UFLC Shimadzu Prominence chromatograph equipped with a BioRad Aminex HPX-87C column (250×4.0mm) and a refraction index detector (RID). The total conversion of polyol Pn ( X P n ) to gaseous and liquid products was determined as: (4) X P n = F P n 0 − F P n F P n 0 where F P n 0 and F P n are the Pn molar flow at the inlet and the exit of the reactor, respectively. The carbon-based conversion of polyol Pn to gaseous products was calculated as: (5) X P n G = ∑ n i F i n P n F P n 0 where ni is the number of C atoms in the product i molecule, Fi the molar flow of gaseous product i formed from polyol Pn, and nPn the number of C atoms in the polyol Pn molecule. The conversion of polyol Pn to liquid products, X P n L , was calculated as the difference X P n G between X P n and The yield to H2 ( Y H 2 , moles of H2 produced/moles of polyol Pn fed) was calculated by considering the stoichiometric factors of reaction 3: (7) Y H 2 = F H 2 F P n 0 . 1 2 n + 1 The selectivity to H2 in the gas phase is defined [3] as the number of moles of H2 produced normalized by the number of moles of H2 that would be present if each mole of carbon in the effluent gas had participated in the polyol reforming reaction to give (2n+1)/n mole of H2. In our catalytic runs the amount of C2 C6 hydrocarbons in the gas phase was lower than 1% in all the cases, which is consistent with results reported in previous work on APR of polyols when no hydrogen is fed to the reactor [3,10], as is the case here. Then, the H2 selectivity was determined as: (8) S H 2 = F H 2 F C O + F C O 2 + F C H 4 . 1 R R where RR, the H2/CO2 reforming ratio, is (2n+1)/n and represents the maximum H2/C molar ratio that can be obtained according to the stoichiometry of reaction 3. The H2 productivity (Pr, mol H2/h gcat) was calculated as: (9) P r = F H 2 W c a t The possibility of pore diffusion limitations was investigated by determining the value of Weisz-Prater parameter ϕ (eq. 10). According to the Weisz-Prater criterion [24], the internal diffusion limitations are negligible if ϕ<1 for a first order reaction or ϕ<0.3 for a second order reaction. Parameter ϕ is expressed by: (10) ϕ = r obs R p 2 C P n D eff where r obs (mol/cm3 s) is the observed reaction rate, Rp (cm) the catalyst particle radius, C P n (mol/cm3) the concentration of Pn, and Deff (cm2/s) the effective diffusivity of Pn in water. We determined the ϕ values corresponding to the maximum r obs values obtained here at 498K for the APR of our four polyols, using an average particle radium of Rp =0.019cm and the D eff values calculated from the Wilke-Chang correlation [25]. The maximum value obtained for parameter ϕ was ϕ=0.005, thereby indicating that the reaction rates reported here are not limited by internal mass transfer phenomena."
4,Results and discussions,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The alumina acid site density was obtained by TPD of NH3. The NH3 desorption rate curve (not shown here) presented a maximum at 500K. The number of surface acid sites density determined from deconvolution and integration of the NH3 TPD curve was 19μmol NH3/g, that is consistent with previous reports showing that commercial Al2O3 CK-300 is a medium-strength acid material [26,27]. The infrared spectrum of Al2O3 support obtained in the hydroxyl stretching region after evacuation at 723K for 4h showed that the hydroxyl group concentration was insignificant. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine confirmed that Al2O3 CK300 contains essentially Lewis acid sites [28]. The X-ray patterns (not shown) of our four Pt/A2O3 catalysts exhibited only the alumina crystalline structure which suggested that platinum was well dispersed on the support. The physicochemical properties of catalysts I, II, III and IV are presented in Table 1 . The alumina impregnation with Pt nitrate solutions and the consecutive calcination and reduction steps involved in the catalyst preparation method did not change significantly the alumina surface area (220m2/g). The Pt dispersion as calculated by H2 chemisorption diminished with the amount of metal from DPt =67% on catalyst I to DPt =54% on catalyst IV. Catalysts III and IV were also characterized by transmission electron microscopy; the corresponding TEM images and size distribution histograms were presented in a previous work [28]. The average volume/area diameter of Pt crystallites (dVA) calculated by TEM were consistent with the mean crystallite sizes determined by H2 chemisorption (Table 1)."
6,Catalytic results,"3.2 Catalytic results 3.2.1 Effect of Pt loading on catalyst activity and selectivity The catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for APR of EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb were evaluated at a space velocity of WHSV=1.2h−1, 498K and 29.3bar. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the evolution of polyol conversion and H2 yield and selectivity as a function of time on catalyst III for APR of EG and Gly. Stationary activity and selectivity values were obtained after about 2h of time on stream; similar reaction start-up periods were observed on the other Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalytic results reported here were all obtained from the stationary region of catalytic runs, typically illustrated in Fig. 2. The effect of Pt loading on catalyst activity is shown in Fig. 3 A and B, where we represented the evolution of total conversion of polyol Pn and Pn conversion to gaseous products, respectively, as a function of surface Pt concentration (Pts, Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3A, X P n increased continuously with Pts, which probably reflects the concomitant generation of surface metallic active sites; a similar activity increase was observed for X P n G vs Pts curves in Fig. 3B. At a given Pts value, X P n and X P n G decreased with the polyol chain length. Regarding the polyol conversion to liquid products, in Fig. 4 we plotted the X P n L / X P n ratio as a function of Pts; in all the cases, X P n L / X P n decreased when the amount of accessible Pt atoms was increased. From the results in Figs. 3 and 4, it is inferred then that the Pt loading increase on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts not only increases the polyol conversion rate but also the proportion of polyol converted to gaseous products. This later result is particularly important taking into account that the predominant polyol conversion to gaseous products is a requisite for improving the production of hydrogen. The H2 selectivity and the product composition in the gas phase obtained for the APR of EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb on catalysts I (0.30% Pt) and IV (2.77% Pt) are presented in Table 2 . The S H 2 values diminished with the polyol chain length, from 95% (EG) to 72% (Sorb) on catalyst I, and from 89% (EG) to 75% (Sorb) on catalyst IV; the H2 concentration in the gas phase followed a similar trend. This relationship between S H 2 and the polyol size agrees with results reported in previous work showing that the H2 selectivity decreases for the APR of polyols with larger carbon chains [3,10,29]. Regarding the effect of %Pt on H2 selectivity, two phenomena must be considered to interpret the results reported in Table 2. First, the H2 selectivity decreases when the polyol conversion increases because larger amounts of H2 are consumed in hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation side-reactions at higher reactant conversion levels [30,31]. Second, at polyol isoconversion, the H2 selectivity increases with surface Pt concentration on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [28]. Results in Table 2 show that X P n is higher on catalyst IV which would result in a lower H2 selectivity as compared to catalyst I; nevertheless, this expected drop in S H 2 may be partially compensated for the higher Pt content on catalyst IV that promotes better the H2 production. Consistently, results in Table 2 shows that the H2 selectivities for each individual polyol are similar on catalyst I and IV. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the H2 yield as a function of the Pt surface concentration for the APR of EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb. In all the cases, Y H 2 increased continuously with Pts which essentially reflects the increase of X P n and X P n G with Pts observed in Fig. 3. At a given Pts value, Y H 2 decreased with the polyol size as it was expected tacking into account that X P n and X P n G (Fig. 3) and S H 2 (Table 2) decreased with the polyol chain length. Similar relationship between Y H 2 and the polyol size was reported by other authors [3,16]. From a commercial point of view, the most important parameter to evaluate the economy of the polyol APR process for producing hydrogen is the H2 productivity, Pr (mol H2/gcat h), i.e. the average rate of H2 production, that is expressed as: (10) P r = F H 2 W c a t = Y H 2 W H S V 2 n + 1 M P n where M P n is the molecular weight of polyol Pn. The Pr vs Pts plots obtained at WHSV=1.2h−1 for the APR of EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb are presented in Fig. 6 and show that in all the cases the H2 productivity increased with the surface Pt concentration. The highest H2 productivities were then obtained here on catalyst IV (2.77% Pt). Actually, Eq. (10) predicts that Pr is proportional to Y H 2 at a constant WHSV value, so that the shape of Pr plots in Fig. 6 are similar to the shape of Y H 2 plots in Fig. 5. Also, the H2 productivity follows the same trend than Y H 2 with respect to the polyol chain length, i.e. EG > Gly > Xyl > Sorb. It is significant noting in Fig. 6 that the Pr plots for polyols of 5 (Xyl) and 6 (Sorb) carbon atoms reached a plateau at Pts ≅ 45μmol/gcat (catalyst III, containing 1.5% Pt) and no significant gain in H2 productivity should be expected, then, when using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts containing higher Pts values. In contrast, the Pr plots corresponding to shorter polyols (Gly and EG) did not reach any plateau in Fig. 6 and higher H2 productivities than those obtained here on catalyst IV (2.77% Pt, Pts =76.7μmol/gcat) may be achieved by using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts containing surface Pt concentrations higher than 76.7μmol/gcat, in particular for EG. 3.2.2 Pt loading and coke formation We also investigated the effect of surface Pt concentration on coke formation by determining by TPO technique the amount of carbon formed on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts recovered from the polyol APR catalytic runs performed at WHSV=1.2h−1 for 300min. Before the TPO characterization, samples were treated at 523K in N2 during 60min. Fig. 7 shows the TPO profiles obtained for samples recovered from the APR of EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb. In general, the coke burnt gave rise to a broad asymmetric band between 500 and 850K with a maximum at about 640–670K for EG, Gly and Xyl that appeared shifted to lower temperatures (560–600K) for Sorb. The shapes of TPO curves for each individual polyol did not change significantly with the Pt% on the catalyst. The amounts of carbon were calculated from the areas under the TPO curves of Fig. 7 and are presented in Table 3 as %C. A clear relationship between Pts and %C is observed in Table 3 for each individual polyol: the higher Pts, the higher the amount of carbon formed on the catalyst. This result may be explained by taking into account the plots in Fig. 3 showing that the polyol conversion increases with Pts; i.e. the higher X P n the higher the coke formation. Moreover, data in Table 3 also shows a clear trend between the polyol size and %C on a given Pt catalyst: the shorter the polyol chain length, the higher the amount of coke. Again, it must be noted here that the plots in Fig. 3 show that at a given Pts value, the polyol conversion increases for shorter substrates. In order to get more insight on the effect of Pts on coke formation, we calculated the number of carbon atoms formed per accessible Pt atom; results are presented in Fig. 8 as C/Pts vs Pts plots. Irrespective of the reactant size, the number of C atoms formed per accessible Pt atom decreased with Pts; in other words, one surface Pt atom forms lesser amounts of carbon when the Pt content on the catalyst is increased. 3.2.3 Metal sintering of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts Finally, we investigated the sintering of Pt in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts during the polyol APR runs by determining the metallic dispersion of catalysts II, III and IV after reaction. At the end of catalytic tests for EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb performed at WHSV=1.2h−1 for 300min, we purged the reactor with nitrogen and then the catalysts were contacted with flowing air at 673K for 3h for eliminating adsorbed products and coke precursors. Then, we determined the platinum dispersion of the samples by H2 chemisorption. In Table 4 , we compare the DPt values obtained on fresh and used catalysts. Clearly, a significant Pt sintering was observed for all the catalysts, irrespective of the reactant size. Results in Table 4 are consistent with previous work reporting that the Pt particles of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are severely sintered under APR reaction conditions [19,28]. A closer inspection of results in Table 4 reveals that the Pt sintering was not related to the size of the polyol molecule. For example, the D P t u s e d / D P t f r e s h ratio values on catalyst II for EG, Gly, Xyl and Sorb were 0.57, 0.59, 0.56 and 0.54, respectively. On the other hand, the magnitude of the DPt drop on stream seems not to be dependent either on the amount of platinum on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. For example, results in Table 4 show that the D P t u s e d / D P t f r e s h ratio values on catalysts II, III and IV for the APR of glycerol were 0.59, 0.59 and 0.57, respectively. In spite of the loss of Pt surface area on stream, we did not detect any significant activity decay once the stationary operating conditions were reached in the standard catalytic runs of 5h length, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Additional catalytic tests of 36h performed for APR of xylitol and sorbitol on catalyst III confirmed that the catalyst activity remained constant during the APR reaction. These results suggest that the Pt sintering probably takes place mainly during the catalyst work-up, i.e. at the start of the APR reaction (Fig. 2). In order to check this assumption, we carried out three catalytic runs of 1h, 2h and 3h length for APR of EG on catalyst IV (DPt =54%) and then we measured the Pt dispersion after reaction. The obtained DPt values were 27%, 31% and 29% for the APR reactions of 1, 2, and 3h, respectively, which confirmed that the Pt sintering occurs mostly in the start-up of the APR reaction, when the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are initially contacted at 498K with the polyol(1%)/water feed stream."
7,Conclusions,"The production of hydrogen by aqueous-phase reforming of C2 C6 polyols on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts containing 0.30–2.77 Pt% depends on the surface Pt concentration (Pts) and the polyol size. The conversion of C2 C6 polyols to gaseous products, and the H2 yield and productivity (Pr) increase with Pts and using shorter substrates. The H2 productivity increases continuously with Pts but reached a plateau for xylitol and sorbitol at about 45μmol Pt/gcat; in contrast, no saturation of Pr vs Pts plots was observed here for glycerol and ethylene glycol when using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts containing up to 76.7μmol Pt/gcat. Similarly, the amount of coke formed on the catalysts increases with Pts and for smaller polyols, probably reflecting the parallel increase of the polyol conversion with both parameters. A severe Pt sintering takes place during the APR of polyols, irrespective of the polyol chain length. The magnitude of the Pt area drop on stream seems not to be dependent on the amount of platinum on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Short-terms catalytic runs performed for APR of ethylene glycol, suggest that the Pt sintering occurs essentially during the start-up of the APR reaction, when Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are initially contacted at 498K with the polyol(1%)/water feed stream."
