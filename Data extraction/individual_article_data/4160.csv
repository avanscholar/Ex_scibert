0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is regarded as an environmentally friendly energy carrier, owing to its good combustion performance and clean combustion product. In recent years, the photocatalytic splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen has been widely studied and is considered as a promising technology to solve the global energy crisis and environmental pollution. [1–3] Many semiconductor materials have been developed as photocatalysts to convert solar energy into hydrogen energy. Among them, TiO2 is one of the most attractive photocatalysts, because it is non-toxic, highly stable, environmentally benign, and inexpensive. In particular, the potential of its conduction band is more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2, making it suitable for hydrogen production. [4] Due to the relatively rapid charge recombination in the bulk and on the surface of TiO2, however, its corresponding activity towards water splitting is significantly limited. In this regard, various modification methods, including ion doping, [5,6] loading a cocatalyst, [7–11] and construction of heterojunctions, [12–14] have been utilized to promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. Among them, the introduction of a metal cocatalyst to complement TiO2 material was found to be an efficient route to construct a high-performance photocatalysis system. Recently, Mott-Schottky photocatalysts based on cobalt nanoparticles coated on nitrogen-rich carbon was applied to oxidize alcohols into eaters. [15] Chen’ group constructed Pd@g-C3N4 Mott-Schottky catalyst for the dehydrogenation of formic acid. [16] Moreover, Pt/PbS heterojunction was designed rationally to control the energy-barrier bending of the Pt/PbS Schottky junction for improving the photoelectron-catalysis hydrogen production activity. [17] Nowadays, Schottky contact is more widely used in photodetector [18,19], gas sensor[20] and biosensor [21] materials, due to the superiority of Schottky-contact sensors in recovery time, detection sensitivity and response signals. [22] The application of Schottky junction in photocatalytic hydrogen production and the mechanism of activity improvement are still less studied. Generally, noble metals, such as Pt [23,24], Au [25–27], Ru [28,29], Pd [30–32], and Ag [33–35] have been widely used as highly efficient cocatalysts for hydrogen production, because they have high work functions, good catalytic activity, and superior stability. When a Mott-Schottky contact is formed in a metal-semiconductor composite, the excitation by light can make the semiconductor generate electron-hole pairs, which moves to the metal-semiconductor interface, so that the metal is negatively charged while the semiconductor is positively charged. [36–38] The efficient separation of spatial charges caused by the Schottky effect makes electrons accumulated in the metal, which is beneficial to the reduction reaction and improves the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. As a matter of fact, copper-based materials are earth-abundant and have been used in diverse photocatalytic reactions. [39] Some recent studies have proved that Cu nanoparticles are very suitable as an alternative to noble metals for hydrogen evolution. [40–42] Based on density functional theory (DFT) support, Greeley et al. [43] pointed out that the non-noble metals Co, Ni, and Cu are moderately active in hydrogen evolution through electrocatalysis. Specifically, the ideal cocatalyst for hydrogen production needs to meet the following requirements: (i) The dissociated hydrogen ions or water molecules need to be adsorbed on the surface of the cocatalyst, which furnishes catalytic activity sites; (ii) The electrons must be transferred from the supported semiconductor to the cocatalyst and then react with adsorbed protons or water molecules on the surface to form active hydrogen; and (iii) Desorption of hydrogen needs to take place from the surface of the cocatalyst. Although there are many reports on the fabrication and photocatlytic application of TiO2-Cu composites, [40,41,44–47] in simple terms, the enhancement mechanism for hydrogen production activity is attributed to the role of the cocatalyst. Nevertheless, mechanisms for improving the separation efficiency of photoelectron-hole pairs need to be further addressed. For example, the formation of Schottky junctions in TiO2-Cu composites to promote electron transfer has been rarely reported. Based on the above background and inspired by the challenges, herein, a hybrid composed of Cu particles decorated with mesoporous TiO2 microrods to form Schottky contacts was fabricated by a facile solvothemal method. The as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrid was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption analysis. In the host photocatalyst-cocatalyst system, the TiO2-Cu was used as the catalyst, and the corresponding photocatalytic capability was evaluated through splitting water to hydrogen and oxygen under simulated sunlight irradiation. The contribution of the thus-formed Schottky contacts in the TiO2-Cu hybrid to its superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capability was also studied."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents All the reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and copper (II) acetate monohydrate were purchased from Aladdin in China. Ethylene glycol (EG), ethanol, methanol, lactic acid, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. in China."
3,Material synthesis,"2.2 Material synthesis TiO2 microrods were prepared through hydrolysis of titanium glycolate precursor microrods. The rod-like titanium glycolate precursor was prepared according to the previous report with minor revision. [48] In a typical synthesis, 5 mL TBOT was first added to a 250 mL flask that contained 180 mL EG and then refluxed at 120 °C under magnetic stirring for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the white precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with deionized water. Finally, the obtained titanium glycolate microrod precursor precipitate was dried at 60 °C overnight for further use. For the fabrication of TiO2 microrods, 0.1 g of the titanium glycolate precursor was dispersed into 35 mL deionized water through ultrasonication for 10 min. Then the homogeneous mixture was put into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 18 h. The phase transformation and structural evolution took place as illustrated in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information."
4,Preparation of Cu-TiO2 hybrid,"2.3 Preparation of Cu-TiO2 hybrid The components of the TiO2-Cu hybrids with varying amounts of copper were synthesized through hydrothermal treatment of the TiO2 microrod precursor and a simple reduction of copper salt, using ethanol as reducing agent and solvent, where the Cu particle synthesis was similar to a previously reported method. [49] In a typical preparation of a TiO2-Cu hybrid, a solution of lactic acid in ethanol was added dropwise to an ethanol solution containing 0.7 mL of 0.05 M Cu(Ac)2·H2O solution under stirring, and the color of the solution was gradually changed from dark green to pale green. The molar ratio of Cu(Ac)2·H2O to lactic acid was 1:4. Then, 10 mL NaOH ethanol solution (0.5 M) was added dropwise into the above solution to until the volume of the total reaction solution reached 80 mL. The light green mixture gradually turned blue. Subsequently, the as-prepared TiO2 microrods were dispersed in the above solution and formed a homogeneous suspension under ultrasonic treatment. Finally, the light green suspension was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the light-grey TiO2-Cu hybrid was obtained by centrifugation from the reaction solution as well as washing with ethanol and deionized water, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight."
5,Materials characterization,"2.4 Materials characterization The as-prepared products were analyzed by the following techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000, 40 kV, 30 mA) was used to identify all of the obtained samples using Cu-Kα radiation from 10° to 80° at a scan rate of 30°/min with step size of 0.014°. SEM images were collected on a field-emission electron microscope (SEM, JSM 5510LV) operating at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The morphology and particle size were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the TEM images were collected on a JSM 2100 electron microscope (200 kV). The oxidation state and surface composition of the catalyst were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Multilab2000) using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation, while the binding energies were calibrated from the C1s photoelectron peak (284.7 eV). The ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectra of the products were collected on a spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan), and BaSO4 was used as the reference. The content of metallic copper in the complex was determined by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Perkin Elmer Optima 7300DV). The Brunauer-Emmertt-Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 (USA). Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were detected with a HITCHI F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained on a CHI 660B electrochemical workstation with a standard three electrode system using Pt wire as counter electrode, Hg/HgCl2 as a reference electrode, and the as-prepared product as working electrode at room temperature."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic activity tests were carried out under vacuum condition in a quartz reactor (500 mL) equipped with a quartz cap allowing for light penetration (CEL-SPH2N-S9, CEAULIGHT Beijing). Typically, 50 mg catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of 20 vol% methanol aqueous solution, under ultrasonic treatment to form a homogeneous solution, in which the methanol was used as a hole sacrificial agent. Before the light irradiation, the quartz reactor was tightly sealed by applying vacuum grease, and a high vacuum condition was maintained to remove the gases present in the free space of the reactor and dissolved in the reaction solution. Afterwards, a 300 W xenon lamp was used as the artificial light source, and the circulating condensed water was held at 10 °C to prevent the evaporation of methanol solution. The photocatalytic activity experiments were performed under light irradiation with continuous agitation for 4 h. At the same time, the H2 production was measured every half hour by on-line gas chromatography (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using N2 as the carrier gas. The distance between the reactor and light source was 2 cm, and condensed circulating water was provided to the condenser pipe to avoid evaporation of the methanol aqueous solution."
7,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 a is a schematic diagram of the fabrication process for the TiO2-Cu hybrids, where TiO2 microrods were first prepared from titanium glycolate precursor, followed by the deposition of copper particles on the TiO2 surface through a simple solvothermal reduction method. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and lactic acid (LA) were used as the dual capping agents, and ethanol was used as the reducing agent and solvent. The Cu nanoparticles were synthesized basing on ligand-exchange method by mixing sodium hydroxide and lactic acid with an ethanol solution of copper acetate. As shown in Fig. 1b, pure white TiO2 powder was obtained, while the color of the TiO2-Cu hybrids changed from light green to dark grey with increasing Cu content. The function of the dual ligand agents was also explored through the observation in the fabrication process of metallic copper in Fig. 2 a–c. The physicochemical adsorption between Cu(II) precursor and TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2d, in which white TiO2 eventually turning light green. The zeta potential measurements show that the surface of TiO2 is positively charged and the Cu(II)/TiO2 with negative charges in Table S1, which illustrates the Cu(II) precursor absorbed on TiO2 by electrostatic attraction. Besides, the effects of ligands on the composition of the products was discussed. It was found that the product was Cu2O in the presence of sole ligand LA and metallic Cu in the presence of NaOH depicted in Fig. 2e. This is probably due to the formation of Cu(OH)2 in the process of metallic Cu formation. Furthermore, the effect of dual ligands on the morphology of metallic Cu was also studied. As shown in Fig. 2f, the SEM pattern of Cu particles synthesized by NaOH as the sole ligand. It was observed that the product was composed of many irregular block copper, which eventually a larger bulk structure was formed. However, with the addition of LA as the second ligand, smaller size and uniform copper nanoparticles can be obtained as shown in Fig. 2g. This is attributed to the formation of Cu(II) lactate complex (CuL2 2−) by the addition of LA to the ethanol solution of copper acetate. According to the Leopold et al., [50] Cu(II) lactate complex (CuL2 2−) can effectively avoid the formation of Cu(OH)2 under strong alkaline conditions. When excessive NaOH is added gradually, Cu(II) lactate complex will first form [CuL2(OH)]3−with some hydroxyl ion, and eventually maybe the complex sodium cuprate (Na2[Cu(OH)4]. On the basis of the above phenomenon and results, it was hoped to prepare the hybrid of TiO2 microrods with Cu particles loading in the present reaction system. The as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrids was first characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 3 a, it can be seen that the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.9°, 48.1°, 54.0°, 55.1°, 62.8°, 69.0°, 70.5°, and 75.3° corresponded to the (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 1 1), (2 0 4), (1 1 6), (2 2 0), and (2 1 5) reflection planes of anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS card No.: 73-1764), respectively, while the peaks located at 2θ = 43.3°, 50.5°, and 74.2° were indexed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of metallic copper (JCPDS card No. 70-3039). With increasing metallic copper loading, the TiO2-Cu (5%) composite clearly exhibits the characteristic peaks of metallic copper in XRD, which indicates that TiO2-Cu consists of Cu metal that is well dispersed on TiO2 microrods. Furthermore, no characteristic peaks of copper oxide or cuprous oxide were detected, even when Cu content is as high as 5 wt%. The ICP-OES measurement of TiO2-Cu hybrids was performed as shown in Fig. 3b. From the results, the actual content of metallic Cu is approximately equal to the theoretical content. The hybrid nature of Cu decorated TiO2 was confirmed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the strong absorption band of pristine TiO2 was around 389 nm, resulting from the excitation of O 2p electrons to the Ti 2d level. [51] The TiO2-Cu hybrids also exhibited an important visible absorption band beyond 400 nm, however. It was also found that absorption took place in the whole visible region, and the absorption intensity increased with the loading of Cu, indicating that the involvement of Cu changes the optical absorption characteristic of the TiO2 product. The enhancement of wavelength absorption in the visible region is likely consistent with the color change of the catalyst from white to pale green to grey. The results revealed that the TiO2-Cu complexes were successfully synthesized from the TiO2, Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, lactic acid, sodium hydroxide, and ethanol as reductant. Fig. 4b shows a plot of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν) for the as-prepared TiO2 and TiO2-Cu hybrids, where α, ν, and h are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, and Planck’s constant, respectively. The band gap energy of TiO2 TiO2-Cu-1%, TiO2-Cu-2.5%, and TiO2-Cu-5% estimated from the Tauc plot of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν) was about 3.01, 2.88, 2.83, and 2.75 eV, respectively. The band gap of TiO2 calculated from absorption edge is consistent with the reported literature. [48] It shows a narrowing tendency with increasing amounts of Cu. These results demonstrate that the TiO2-Cu hybrids were successfully synthesized by this simple solvothermal method using ethanol as the reducing agent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further utilized to determine the chemical states of the component elements of the TiO2-Cu hybrid. Fig. 5 a shows all the spectra of the TiO2-Cu hybrid, and they displays the presence of Cu, Ti, O, and C element. Fig. 5b presents the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p. The binding energies of 932.7 and 952.2 eV are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, indicating that Cu (II) was reduced to Cu (0), while the hybrid displays no apparent shake-up satellite peaks.[40,45] Fig. 5c displays the O 1s peak of the TiO2-Cu hybrid, and the binding energy peak at 529.9 eV is attributed to the O2− ions in the TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5d, the peaks in the Ti 2p spectrum are located at 458.7 and 464.4 eV, which is ascribed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, suggesting the existence of the Ti4+ oxidation state in the hybrid [52,53]. The morphology and structure of the TiO2-Cu hybrid were analyzed from SEM, TEM, and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images. Fig. 6 a shows an SEM image of the TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid, and it can be observed that the hybrid displays the same rod-like structure as the pure TiO2 material. The TEM image shown in Fig. 6b indicates that this hybrid was composed of many small nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 6c, the clear lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.35 nm correspond to the (1 0 1) planes of anatase TiO2, while the interplanar d-spacing of 0.21 nm matches well with the (1 1 1) planes of Cu. In order to further confirm the composition of the TiO2-Cu hybrid, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping was performed to gain more information on distribution of the Cu particles and TiO2 microrods. As shown in Fig. 6d–g, the white, red, and green colors represent the distributions of O, Ti, and Cu, respectively. A clearer distribution of elements in TiO2-Cu hybrid was shown in Fig. S2. The presence of the three elements in the product is in good agreement with the synthesis of a TiO2-Cu hybrid. The above results indicated that the TiO2-Cu hybrid was successfully synthesized by the present method with involving of dual ligand agents. It was widely reported that the synergistic effect of the metal oxide could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance of the hybrid through electron transfer from oxide to the metal on the basis of heterojunction theory. [54] Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were generally employed to study the charge transfer property between the oxide and the metal. Herein, the transient photocurrent response of working electrodes made of TiO2-Cu hybrids was investigated to study the charge separation and transport behavior between TiO2 and Cu particles. When the working electrode was tested by light irradiation from light-off to light-on, the intensity of the photocurrent was closely related to the separation and migration efficiency of the photoinduced electrons and holes. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the photocurrent density of pure TiO2 is less than 1.5 × 10−8 A * cm−2, while those of the as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrids are higher than for the pure TiO2. The enhanced photocurrent response of the hybrids indicates that the involvement of Cu particles could facilitate the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the TiO2 microrods under irradiation. It was also found that the highest photocurrent density was produced by the TiO2-Cu −2.5% hybrid, which was almost 28 times as high as that of pure TiO2. Fig. 7b shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the as-synthesized TiO2 and TiO2-Cu materials. It is well-known that the EIS can elucidate the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and the interface charge-transfer resistance of materials. Further, a smaller arc radius on the plot suggests better charge transfer capacity. [55–57] As shown in Fig. 7b, all the EIS Nyquist plots are composed of semicircle in mid-high frequency region, and a sloping line in the low frequency region. The TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid has the smallest semicircle, indicating the most effective separation of electron-hole pairs and the fastest interfacial charge transfer. As depicted in Fig. 8 a, considering that the work function (W m) of Cu metal is larger than that of TiO2 semiconductor (W s), the electrons would flow from the TiO2 to the Cu metal. Finally, as shown in Fig. 8b, the motion of the electrons would result in the phenomenon that the Fermi levels of the metal Cu (E F,m) and TiO2 (E F,s) reach the same level. In equilibrium, a Helmholtz double layer would be established at the TiO2-Cu interface, where the Cu metal is negatively charged and the TiO2 is positively charged near its surface due to electrostatic induction. [36] Accordingly, an electric field would form between the Cu metal and TiO2 material. As a result, excited electrons find it difficult to pass through the Schottky barrier, so that the impedance becomes very large and the ability to suppress electron-hole pair recombination is greatly enhanced. This phenomenon indicates that the as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrid could have enhanced photocatalytic capacity. Photocatalytic hydrogen production activity on the as-fabricated TiO2-Cu hybrids was evaluated under Xe lamp irradiation using a methanol aqueous solution (vol. 20%) as the sacrificial reagent. All measurements were performed in an on-line photocatalytic hydrogen production system at room temperature. Blank experiment results indicated that there was no hydrogen generation without the photocatalyst or light irradiation. When Cu metal was used as the photocatalyst, no hydrogen was produced either. These results demonstrated that it was necessary to introduce the TiO2-based materials into the photocatalytic system under light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 9 a and b, the introduction of Cu particles had a significant impact on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It can be observed that pure TiO2 microrods showed poor photocatalytic H2 evolution (260 μmol g−1 h−1) in the absence of a cocatalyst. The introduction of metallic Cu, however, could significantly improve the photocatalytic hydrogen performance of TiO2. With increasing Cu content, the hydrogen production activity was dramatically enhanced initially and then showed a decrease. Among them, the TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of 6046 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 23 times higher than for pure TiO2 microrods and better than other reports displayed in Table 1 . In addition, the cyclic stability of metallic Cu as cocatalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen production on TiO2 was evaluated. As depicted in Fig. 9c and d, the synthesized TiO2-Cu-2.5% still maintained good photocatalytic activity after 4 cycles (total 17 h irradiation). Moreover, the XRD patterns of TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid before and after hydrogen production cycle test is shown in Fig. S3. It was found that the peaks of metallic Cu in TiO2-Cu hybrid corresponded to the standard Cu (JCPDS card No. 73-3039). These results indicated that the photocatalyst has good stability and reusability. In general, a photocatalysts with a high specific surface area and high pore volume could have more active sites contributing to superior photocatalytic activity. Herein, the pore structure and BET surface areas of the synthesized TiO2 and TiO2-Cu hybrids were measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis. As shown in Fig. 10 a and d, the pure TiO2 and TiO2-Cu hybrids exhibit type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms, which suggests that these materials have abundant mesopores (2–50 nm). Moreover, the pore size distribution curves calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method reveal that the TiO2-Cu hybrids contain small mesopores with an average pore size of 7.8–8.5 nm, which is similar to the case of pristine TiO2. This indicates that the copper particles on TiO2 could not destroy the pore structure of pristine TiO2. As listed in Table 2 , with increasing amounts of copper, the BET surface areas of the TiO2-Cu hybrid showed small change. In other words, the surface area is not the main parameter which affects the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2-Cu materials towards hydrogen evolution. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were employed to study the separation efficiency and recombination rate of the photoinduced electrons and holes in the materials during the photocatalytic reaction. It is generally accepted that lower emission intensity suggests a superior charge transfer capability, which is beneficial for the separation of electron-hole pairs. Fig. 11 displays the PL spectra of the obtained TiO2 and TiO2-Cu hybrids. It is clearly observed that the relative PL intensity of TiO2 is the highest, which suggests that the electrons and holes produced in TiO2 have a greater tendency to recombine. On the other hand, the TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid exhibited diminished intensity in comparison to pure TiO2 and the other TiO2-Cu hybrids, indicating that the as-synthesized TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid would prevent the recombination of the carriers generated in the photocatalysis process. The impact of the introduction of copper metal on the separation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs was further studied by creating a photogenerated electron decay plot. As the photoresponse was recorded, the rapid decay of photogenerated electrons manifests the fast consumption of photoinduced carriers. Fig. 12 presents the normalized decay profiles that were fitted by employing double-exponential decay curves (y = A 1*exp (−x/τ 1) + A 2*exp (−x/τ 2)), in which τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes. It is well known that the emergence of two decay times usually points to two consecutive transfer processes of the excited electrons. As shown in the table inset in Fig. 12, the obtained lifetime (τ 1) of photogenerated electrons for TiO2-Cu-2.5% is 4.43 s. which is 1.7 times higher than that of pure TiO2 (2.58 s). The prolonged τ 1 time is likely to represent the decay time of photoinduced electrons in the TiO2, and τ2 means the time for the electrons to transfer from TiO2 to Cu to react with Na2SO4 electrolyte. The above result showed that the photogenerated carriers underwent a fast recombination, owing to the lack of an electron capture process. In the TiO2-Cu hybrid, however, Cu metal could be used as an electron capture center to gather electrons and then further promote the hydrogen production through the electron reduction of protons or water during the photocatalytic process of water splitting. In the present work, it was confirmed that the synthesized TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor by determining the flat potential in Na2SO4 solution (Supporting Information, Fig. S4). On the basis of the above experimental results, a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over the TiO2-Cu hybrid was proposed. As shown in Fig. 13 , when TiO2-Cu hybrid catalyst was irradiated by simulated sunlight, the TiO2 microrods would absorb UV light to generate electron-hole pairs. Taking in to account the higher work function of Cu metal (W m = 4.65 eV) than that of TiO2 (W S = 4.13 eV), the photoinduced electrons are transferred from TiO2 to the Cu metal. As the same time, the strong interfacial interaction in the TiO2-Cu hybrid and the Schottky barrier formed between TiO2 and Cu promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons to Cu. Furthermore, the electrons gathered on the copper metal find it hard to cross the Schottky barrier to TiO2, which greatly promotes the separation of photoinduced charges. In other words, the enhanced electron-hole pairs separation via Schottky contacts in the TiO2-Cu hybrid as well as the cocatalyst role of Cu metal contributed to the improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capability. In addition, the TiO2-Cu-2.5% hybrid was also used as the photocatalyst to achieve photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol, isopropanol, and benzyl alcohol at room temperature under simulated sunlight irradiation. As shown in Fig. 14 b, the hydrogen generation rate from ethanol, isopropanol, and benzyl alcohol was about 3532, 1890, and 521 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, upon the photocatalytic material. The hydrogen production activity is higher for water than for those alcohols used as reactants. Nevertheless, the results show that the as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrid has great potential for the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, a simple solvothermal method was developed to deposit Cu metal nanoparticles on mesoporous TiO2 microrods for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The effect of dual ligands on the composition and morphology were studied. The composition and structure were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption analysis. Due to the characteristic work functions of Cu metal and TiO2, Schottky contacts emerged, which endow the hybrid with efficient spatial charge separation and swift carrier transport. Among the as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrids, the TiO2-Cu-2.5% sample exhibited the highest hydrogen generation rate of 6046 μmol g−1 h−1, which is much higher than that of pure TiO2 (about 260 μmol g−1 h−1) using methanol as sacrificial agent under UV–vis light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the Schottky barriers at the interfaces of the Cu metal and TiO2, and the abundant active sites of Cu metal particles used as a cocatalyst. The as-prepared TiO2-Cu hybrid also showed potential for the photocatalytic dehydrogeneration of ethanol, isopropanol, and benzyl alcohol. It is expected that this work could lead to the potential replacement of low-cost and earth-abundant Cu metal for the noble metals as co-catalyst for highly efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion."
