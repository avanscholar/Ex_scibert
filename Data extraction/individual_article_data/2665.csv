0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is regarded as a kind of pollution-free energy carrier that can replace fossil fuels and plays an important role in the future. The hydrogen is mainly derived from fossil fuels (such as natural gas and petroleum). However, the main disadvantages of such fuels to produce hydrogen are low conversion efficiency and emission of greenhouse gases to the environment [1,2]. Taking the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and contamination into consideration, hydrogen should be manufactured based on renewable sources [3,4]. With the widespread use of biological wastewater treatments, a large amount of sewage sludge is produced. Sewage sludge (SS) from a wastewater treatment plant contains high levels of organic matters and proteins, and therefore is a potential substrate for producing hydrogen [5–8]. However, the presence of heavy metals in sewage sludge restricts its use, whether it is applied to gasification or fertilizer. Heavy metals in sewage sludge are considered as toxic catalyst for gasification and reduced the gasification efficiency seriously [9]. Moreover, the fertilizer of sewage sludge also results in a higher content of heavy metals in the food chain, ultimately causing metabolic disorders and chronic diseases in humans [10]. To reduce the toxicity of sewage sludge which attributes to heavy metals, great efforts on pretreatment has been studied in last several decades. Chemical pretreatments such as using Fe2(SO4)3, FeCl3 [11,12], chelating agents [13], and organic and inorganic acids [12] are able to remove and/or modify some organic compounds. Consequently, such treatments can modify the gasification performance and remove heavy metals from sewage sludge [14,15]. However, the practical application of the chemical processes is still limited due to large number of chemicals requirements, high operating cost and secondary pollution problems [11]. Bioleaching is defined as “the dissolution of heavy metals from solid substrates either directly by metabolism of leaching bacteria or indirectly by the products of metabolism” [10]. It has been thought to be an efficient, environmentally friendly and economical method for removal heavy metals from the sewage sludge, which is 80% cheaper in terms of chemical consumption compared to the traditional chemical methods employed for heavy metals leaching from the sewage sludge [10]. The bioleaching process is based on a variety of acidophilic and chemoautolithotrophic bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans which have unique property to survive in acid environment and to carry out oxidation of insoluble iron and sulfur compounds. The solubilization mechanism of bioleaching by bacteria, such as At. ferrooxidans which acquire their energy through oxidation of ferrous iron, can be direct and indirect [10]. Direct Reaction: (1) MeS + 2 O 2 → At . ferroxidans MeSO 4 In the direct mechanism, metal sulfides can be oxidized into sulfates by At. ferrooxidans. Indirect Reactions: (2) 2 FeSO 4 + 0.5 O 2 + H 2 SO 4 → A . ferrooxidans Fe 2 ( SO 4 ) 3 + H 2 O (3) 4 Fe 2 ( SO 4 ) 3 + 2 MeS + 4 H 2 O + 2 O 2 → 2 M 2 + + 2 SO 4 2 - + 8 FeSO 4 + 4 H 2 SO 4 In the formulas above, MeS and M2+ denotes the metal sulfide and soluble metallic ion, respectively. In the indirect reactions, the bacteria oxidize the Fe2+ to Fe3+ the liquid phase and the Fe3+ in turn leaches through a chemical reaction to produce sulfuric acid. The production of sulfuric acid leads to a decrease in pH, thus causing solubilization of sludge-borne metals. However, the pH of the bioleached sewage sludge is relatively low and it could be used for land application only if the acid in the sludge is neutralize either by composting or adding some kinds of alkaline reagent, which will lead to high cost. Moreover, the bioleaching process also has been proven to be capable of digesting sewage sludge, improving the dewatering ability and eliminating or modifying some organic compounds [14,16,17], which may facilitate gasification. So far, to authors’ knowledge, there are no studies of the hydrogen-rich gas derived from steam gasification of bioleached sewage sludge, which has great environmental and energy significance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of bioleaching on hydrogen-rich gas production by steam gasification of sewage sludge. Influences of sewage sludge solids concentrations during the bioleaching process and gasification temperatures on product distribution and gasification performances were evaluated. The other aim of this study is to investigate whether changes of sewage sludge’s physicochemical characteristics after the bioleaching process are favor for gasification."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sewage sludge (SS) used in this study was from a Wuhan urban wastewater treatment plant located in Hubei province, China. Dehydrated sewage sludge was collected and stored in a refrigerator as original material for the bioleaching experiments. The initial pH of sewage sludge was 8.6 and the moisture content of it was 80.4%. At. ferrooxidans LX5 in the bioleaching process were from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The 9K broth of At. ferrooxidans LX5 consisted of 3g/L (NH4)2SO4, 0.1g/L KCl, 0.5g/L K2HPO4, 0.5g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01g/L Ca(NO3)2 and 44.2g/L FeSO4·7H2O. The pH of the 9K broth was adjusted to 2.00 by H2SO4."
3,Bioleaching,"2.2 Bioleaching Bioleaching treatments were carried out in 2.5L flasks agitated by stirring at 200rpm in a thermostatic water tank. 1L of sewage sludge with various solids concentrations (6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 14% (w/v)) was added to the flask, respectively. pH was adjusted to 4.0 by H2SO4. 10mL medium contained microorganism in log phase was incubated into the flask and maintained at 30°C. 4g FeSO4·7H2O was then fed into the flask. Distilled water was replenished for evaporation per 48h. When pH finally stabled at around 2 for 4h, bioleaching reached the endpoint. Heavy metals leaching efficiency was investigated. Flask was left standing for 2h to separate sediment from wastewater. Sediments was further centrifuged for 30min at 3000rpm and then dried at 105°C for overnight which was used in the following investigations."
4,Gasification apparatus and procedures,"2.3 Gasification apparatus and procedures The gasification experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure, and the apparatus is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . It was mainly consisted of the fixed bed reactor and associated auxiliary equipments which included electric furnace heater, temperature controller cabinet and gas purification unit. The experimental device consists of three parts: The first part is the quartz tube reactor, with a quartz tube of 1000mm (length)×60mm (diameter) heated by an electric furnace. The heating furnace (manufactured at Wuhan Electric Furnace Factory) is the main equipment of heating systems (4kW). It is used to supply heat for gasification. The main components include a metal shell, resistance wires, a heating preservation implement, an insulation layer and a steam generator. The size of the heating bore in the furnace is ∅80mm×600mm. Resistance wires withstanding a maximum temperature of 1200°C are mainly arranged in the middle of the furnace. Sewage sludge is placed in a boat made of 1Gr18Ni9Ti stainless steel. The second part is the temperature controller, a K-type nickel–chromium–nickel silicon thermocouple (∅3mm×500mm) for measuring the heating zone temperature. The temperature control cabinet (KSW-5D-12 type, manufactured at Hudong Electric Factory) and K-type thermocouples are combined and function together as an automatic temperature control system. The third part is a gas purification implement which contains a drying tube and a cotton core filter. At the start-up of each test, 5g sewage sludge was put into a stainless steel boat, which was placed in the inlet of the quartz tubular. Temperature is an important factor affecting the gasification performance of a feedstock. As the components of the samples are complex and the heat conductivity of each component is different, the real temperature of the samples is difficult to be accurately measured during the gasification process. However, the furnace temperature can approximately reflect the change of the test sample. So it can be regarded as the gasification temperature of the sample at the time. Nitrogen gas with flow rate of 100ml/min was injected for 20min to maintain anoxic atmosphere. Subsequently, the electric heater was turned on to heat the reactor to the set-point temperature. Then the stainless steel boat was pushed from the inlet to the heating zone. Meantime, steam was introduced to the gasifier at a desired flow rate (steam to feedstock was set at 1.08). The volatile gasification products flowed out the reactor and passed through a water condenser. Those non-condensable gases were precleaned through a drying tube and a cotton core filter which can remove fine particles and H2O. Subsequently, the non-condensable gases were collected with a tedlar sampling bag for GC analysis and the volume of gas produced was measured by a gas flow meter. The condensable gases changed into liquid (including water and tar), which was captured by the collector. The condenser and all connection tubes were then washed using acetone, and the liquid was also collected. Water in the collected solution was removed by anhydrous sodium sulfate; the organic phase was further filtered to remove the fine particles; then, the filtrate was dried at 60°C to remove the acetone, and the residue was mostly the tar. Effects of concentrations of the bioleaching sewage sludge solids on product distributions and gas compositions were investigated in this work. The bioleaching of sewage sludge with different solids concentrations were varied from 6% to 14% (w/v) in 2% increments and the temperature of gasifier was 800°C. Influences of the temperature on product distributions and gas compositions were also studied. The experiments were performed at temperatures between 600°C and 900°C. In gasification test, the steam to feedstock was set at 1.08. The tar was weighted and recorded as the tar yield. The quantity of the char was obtained by weighting the stainless steel boat before and after the experiment at the end of each run. The non-condensable gases yield was determined by difference based on the mass balance. Each experiment was conducted at least two times to ensure the mass balance and data reliability. The date reported in this paper was average values of two times."
5,Method of sampling and analysis,"2.4 Method of sampling and analysis Elemental C, H, and N abundances were determined using a CHN Elemental Analyzer (Carlo-Erba NA-1500) via high-temperature catalyzed combustion followed by infrared detection of the resulting CO2, H2 and NO2 gases, respectively. The oxygen content was obtained using a LECO-VTF-900 furnace coupled to the microanalyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis instruments (SDT Q600, TA instruments) showed the proximate analyses of the sewage sludge samples conditions (that is, moisture, volatile matters, fixed carbon, and ash content of the material). The results of proximate and ultimate analyses of sewage sludge samples were shown in Table 1 . Heavy metals in sewage sludge were extracted by HNO3:HClO4:HF (3:1:1) and then tested by ICP. The sewage sludge contained 196.4μg/g Cu, 269.7μg/g Zn, 63.2μg/g Pb and 4.82μg/g Cd. In order to study changes of sewage sludge’s chemical characteristics after bioleaching, FTIR analyses was used for original and bioleached sewage sludge. The materials were ground to fine particles and mixed with KBr powder. Press the mixtures into chips and then sent for FTIR analyses. The mass ratio of the sample to KBr powder was 1:100. The spectral resolution was 4cm−1. The main gas compositions (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6) were analyzed by GC 9800T which functioned based on a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with TDX-01 columns. The temperatures of the injector, oven and detector were at 200°C, 85°C and 90°C, respectively. The carrier gas in all analyses was argon. Standard gas mixtures were examined by the quantitative calibration."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Bioleaching,"3.1 Bioleaching Bioleaching process uses the catalytic effect produced by the metabolic activities of iron-oxidizing and sulfur-oxidizing micro-organisms, and this lead to an acceleration of the chemical degradation of the sulfides [18]. The optimum bioleaching conditions are determined by pre-experiments and are similar to the former researches [19] related to metals leaching efficiencies. Through H2SO4 pre-acidification, the bioleaching pH decreased from 4.0 to about 2.0 in 48h. After 48h of reaction time, the pH decreased from 4 to 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.4, and 2.7, for sludge solids concentrations of 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 14% (w/v), respectively. The result indicates that higher sewage sludge solids concentration had higher buffering capacity and required more time and acid to decrease the pH [20]. The pH stabilized at around 2.0 for about 6h, and then it began to rise (higher than 6.0 in 12h). The concentration of heavy metals in water phase reached the highest point after the pH had stabilized around 2.0 for 4h. Therefore, the ended of bioleaching was pH lowered to 2 for 4h. 3.1.1 Influences of sewage sludge solids concentration on heavy metals removal Influences of sewage sludge solids concentration on the removal efficiency of heavy metals after bioleaching treatments were investigated, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . It is evident that the removal efficiency of heavy metals can be strongly influenced by solids concentrations. When the solids concentration increases from 6% to 14%, the dissolution efficiency of Cu decreases from 73.08% to 38.97%, Zn from 78.67% to 40.02%, Pb from 24.63% to 11.53%, and Cd from 79.56% to 49.89%, respectively. This is because the final pH value was higher for the bioleaching system with higher sewage sludge solids concentration due to higher buffering capacity, however the solubilization efficiency of heavy metals was found to highly depend on the pH value during the bioleaching process [10]. The dissolution efficiencies of Cu, Zn and Cd from sewage sludge are significantly higher than that of Pb with same solid concentration. The reason might be attributed to the solubilized Pb can form into low solubility of PbSO4 (K sp =1.62×10−8) with sulfate during the bioleaching process [10]. In conclusion, sewage sludge solids concentration significantly influences heavy metals dissolution during bioleaching treatments. Based on the results of experiments, the optimal solids concentration for heavy metal dissolution is 6% (w/v) under certain experimental conditions. 3.1.2 Characteristics of sewage sludge Variations in the volatile matters, fixed carbon, ash, C, H, O, N contents and H/C, O/C, N/C ratio indicate that bioleaching treatments of sewage sludge can lead to changes in their organic matter compositions. From Table 1, it can be observed that the ash content is reduced after bioleaching treatments. Meanwhile, as the sludge solids concentrations range from 14% to 6% (w/v), the ash content decrease from 56.23% to 31.26%. This result could be attributed to solubilization of heavy metals during bioleaching treatments. Moreover, acidification rate of sludge increases as the solids concentration decreases, which lead to higher solubilization efficiencies. The volatile matter increases after bioleaching treatments, which indicates that the bioleaching treatments might be helpful for gasification. It can be found that compared with that of original sewage sludge, bioleached sewage sludge has lower H/C and N/C ratios and a higher O/C ratio. The H/C ratio decreases with bioleaching treatment from 2.87 to 2.77 (6% (w/v)), whilst the H/C ratio decreases from 2.77 to 2.33 when the sludge solids concentration increases from 6% to 14% (w/v). Consequently, bioleached sewage sludge shows more aromatic groups than original sewage sludge. This result could be due to the solubilization of light organic compounds during the bioleaching process [21]. Meanwhile, in different sludge solids concentrations, sludge solids concentration of 6% (w/v) presents the highest H/C ratio, which indicates the presence of elevated aliphatic carbon content [22]. High aliphatic carbon contents are advantageous to the generation of the alkane gaseous or light aromatic hydrocarbon. Furthermore, the N/C ratio can be used to evaluate polymerization degrees of organic matters in sewage sludge. More N-containing function groups would be expected in the less-polymerized organic matter [14]. Therefore, with a sludge solid concentration of 6% (w/v), bioleached sewage sludge has a higher polymerization degree, which indicates a higher dewatering capacity. Song and Zhou [23] also reported the similar results. Compared with that of original sewage sludge, the O/C ratio of bioleached sewage sludge increased regardless of sludge solids concentrations. However, the O/C ratio is a deficient parameter for organic matter indicating, since some oxygen can be transferred to oxygenous functions groups or oxidized during the reaction. The results of FTIR spectra of original and bioleached sewage sludge are given in Fig. 2 . As is observed, original and bioleached sewage sludge show similar spectral bands. However, after bioleaching, especially with sludge solid concentration of 6% (w/v), OH stretching vibrations at 3432cm−1, CO stretching vibrations at 1642cm−1, CH stretching vibrations at 1393cm−1 and CO stretching vibrations at 1038cm−1 are strengthened, which means that the quantities of these groups increase greatly. It is definitely caused by bioleaching digestion which breaks macromolecules and releases much more free groups. According to former researches [24,25], OH stretching vibrations at 3432cm−1 indicate the existence of water, alcohol, phenol, or amine substance; CO stretching vibrations at 1642cm−1 are compatible with the presence of acids and aldehydes; CH stretching vibrations at 1393cm−1 are generated by CH3 and CH2 group, which indicates that sewage sludge contains a lot of fat hydrocarbon organic matters; CO stretching vibrations at 1038cm−1 are corresponded to oxidizing substances of ether, ester, alcohol, phenol. According to the FTIR spectra, it can be concluded that bioleaching treatments especially with solids concentration of 6% (w/v) increases the oxygen functional groups content of sewage sludge, which enable sludge to be fractured easily to form gas volatiles. Characteristics of original and bioleached sewage sludge indicate that bioleaching treatments of sewage sludge bring about important modifications in characteristics of organic matters, especially with sludge solid concentration of 6% (w/v), which may facilitate gasification."
8,Influences of concentrations of bioleaching sewage sludge solids on product distributions and gas compositions,"3.2 Influences of concentrations of bioleaching sewage sludge solids on product distributions and gas compositions Characterization of sewage sludge samples has showed that bioleaching treatments can modify the organic matter composition of sewage sludge which might be helpful for gasification. To investigate the effect of concentrations of bioleaching sewage sludge solids on bioleached sewage sludge steam gasification, the product distributions and gas compositions are studied in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3(a), gas yields gradually decrease and char yields increases when bioleached sewage sludge solids concentrations rise from 6% to 14%. Meanwhile, tar yields increased slightly from 14.8% to 16.4%. However, compared with the original sewage sludge, the products of gas and tar yields are higher as well as char yields are lower in bioleached sewage sludge gasification. Changes lists above are mainly attributed to two facts: (1) characteristics of sewage sludge are changed after bioleaching treatments, such as the change of volatile matters (Table 1); (2) higher concentrations of sewage sludge solids have lower dissolution efficiency. According to Fig. 3(b), the concentrations of major gaseous products such as H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6, appeared nonlinear trends with increments of the sewage sludge solids concentrations. H2 and CO concentrations increase obviously when the sewage sludge solids concentrations decrease from 14% to 6%. In addition, CH4 concentrations alter slightly and CO2 concentrations decrease dramatically. The steam could participate in gasification process described by the following reactions: (4) Boudouard reaction : C + CO 2 → 2 CO Δ H 298 0 = 162.4 kJ / mol (5) Water gas shift reaction : CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 0 = - 41 kJ / mol (6) Carbon gasification reaction : C + H 2 O → CO + H 2 Δ H 298 0 = 131.3 kJ / mol (7) Secondary tar cracking reaction : Tar + n 1 H 2 O → n 2 CO 2 + n 3 H 2 Δ H 298 0 > 0 (8) Steam reforming methane reaction : CH 4 + H 2 O → CO + 3 H 2 Δ H 298 0 = 206.3 kJ / mol According to Zhang et al. [24], the steam generated from the sewage sludge take part in the Boudouard reaction (Eq. (4)), water–gas shift reactions (Eq. (5)), carbon gasification reaction (Eq. (6)), secondary cracking reactions of tar (Eq. (7)), together with the steam reforming methane reaction (Eq. (8)) are the main factors responsible for the increase in H2 and CO contents. CO2 content showed a decreasing trend with the sewage sludge solids concentrations decrease from 14% to 6%. This result is related to the fact that the fractions of CO, CO2 and H2, are linked together by the equilibrium of the water gas shift reaction under test conditions. Furthermore, the highest H2 content might result from the highest hydrogen content in the element composition of bioleached sewage sludge (6% (w/v)) (Table 1). Except those from the aforementioned sources, CO might be also generated through cracking of carbonyl group, rupture of oxygen heterocycle and dehydrogenation of hydroxyl group [26]. The light hydrocarbons of CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 are mainly produced through cracking of aromatic-ring aliphatic side chains and aliphatic hydrocarbons during gasification process [27]. Thus, the relatively slight change of concentrations of CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 in gaseous product should be related to the similarly slight change of tar yields. However, it should be noted that final gas compositions of the steam gasification process might not be exclusively reason for the gasification of char and cracking tar due to combining a series of complex and competing reactions, which would probably affect the final gas compositions."
9,Influences of the temperature on product distributions and gas compositions,"3.3 Influences of the temperature on product distributions and gas compositions With least residual heavy metals, best dewatering capacity and more gases production, sewage sludge solids of 6% (w/v) concentration was used as raw materials. To set up control experiments, original sewage sludge for gasification is also investigated. Gasification temperature is the most important parameter affecting the product yields. The basic role of temperature is to provide necessary heat of decomposition to fragment feedstock linkages. Modifications in the products composition measure the capability of temperature to decompose the feedstock. The effect of gasification temperature on products distributions and gas compositions is illustrated in Fig. 4 . As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), increasing temperature resulted in increase gas yield with the obviously reduction in the yield of char and slight decreased in the yield of tar for both bioleached sewage sludge and original sewage sludge. The reason should be due to higher temperatures favor Boudouard reaction (Eq. (4)), carbon gasification reaction (Eq. (6)), secondary cracking reactions of tar (Eq. (7)) and steam reforming methane reaction (Eq. (8)). However, when the temperature increases from 600°C to 900°C, the gas yields (26.3–49.4%) of bioleached sewage sludge are higher than those of original sewage sludge (24.5–38.2%). This may be attributed to the fact that bioleaching treatments change the characteristics of original sewage sludge, and therefore the sewage sludge is able to release more gas volatiles under the high temperature. The char yields from bioleached sewage sludge decrease more significantly (57.5–38.3%) than those from original sewage sludge did (61.1–48%) when the reactor temperature increased. This decrease is speculated to be owing to the heavy metals leaching out and more easily devolatilization of solid hydrocarbons and gasification of the carbonaceous residues in the char after bioleaching at high temperature. With the increasing temperature, tar yields present a slight difference between that of bioleached sewage sludge and that of original sewage sludge, which indicates that bioleaching treatments have no noteworthy influence on the tar yields. The effect of reactor temperatures on gas compositions is presented in Fig. 4(b). As shown in Fig. 4(b), the elevating reactor temperature leads to the higher H2 and CO concentrations. However, when the reactor temperature increases, the content of CO2 displays a significant decrease, and CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 present a slight downward trend. According to Le Chatelier’s principle, high temperatures keep more reactants in exothermic reactions and generate more products in endothermic reactions [2,28]. Therefore, the main endothermic reactions, such as Boudouard reactions (Eq. (4)), carbon gasification reactions (Eq. (6)), secondary cracking reactions of tar (Eq. (7)) and steam reforming methane reactions (Eq. (8)), are the key factors in the increment of H2 and CO concentrations and the decrease of CO2, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 concentrations. The results are agreed with the former researches [2,29] that higher temperatures provide more favorable conditions for thermal cracking and steam reforming. Compared with that of original sewage sludge, however, the steam gasification of bioleached sewage sludge with a solids concentration of 6% (w/v) presents an interesting phenomenon when the reactor temperature increases. The volume percentages of gas compositions, especially in H2 contents that produced from the steam gasification of bioleached sewage sludge, are higher than that of original sewage sludge. When the reactor temperature increases from 600°C to 900°C, the H2 contents of gasified bioleached and original sewage sludge rise from 30.1% to 46.4% and from 24.5% to 38.3%, respectively. Based on the results of FTIR spectra analysis, stretching vibration adsorption peaks of OH, CH, CO, and CO are strengthened with the solids concentration of 6% (w/v). With the increasing temperature, breaks of CH bonds lead to decomposition of aliphatic hydrocarbon and give rise to some light hydrocarbon gases, such as CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. Breaks of instable CO bonds generate a large amount of CO and CO2 [30]. Meanwhile, CO stretching vibration adsorption peaks strengthened, probably because of the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons [30]. Cracking and reforming of aromatics and a large amount of H2 further explains the significant improvement of H2 yields as the temperature rise from 600°C to 900°C."
10,Conclusion,"In the present work, hydrogen-rich gas production by the steam gasification of bioleached sewage sludge was investigated in a lab-scale fixed bed at a reactor temperature in the range of 600–900°C and bioleached sewage sludge solids concentrations in the range of 6–14% (w/v). The influence of the bioleaching treatment and the reactor temperature on gasification performances of bioleached sewage sludge for product distributions and gas compositions was discussed. Bioleaching treatments of sewage sludge reduces the heavy metal content and modifies the characteristics of original sewage sludge, especially under the condition of a sewage sludge solids concentration of 6% (w/v), which may advance gasification. With the sludge solids concentrations varying from 6% to 14% (w/v) in 2% increments, the char yields increased, and the gas yields decreased significantly. The content of H2 in the gas product decreased from 38.32% to 29.74%. Higher temperature resulted in a higher conversion of bioleached sewage sludge into hydrogen-rich gas with a significant increase of H2 content from 30.1% to 46.4% with temperature increasing from 600°C to 900°C, the char yield and tar yield decreased, while the gas yield increased. However, compared with the original sewage sludge, steam gasification of bioleached sewage sludge (6% (w/v)) produced more gas yield and H2 content."
