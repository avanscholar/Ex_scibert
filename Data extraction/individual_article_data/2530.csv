0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a potentially desirable alternative energy source as a nonpolluting, efficient, and cost attractive energy carrier. At present, due to the depletion of petroleum and international environmental regulations, many researchers are working to shift the use of petroleum resources to non-petroleum resources such as biomasses as raw material for hydrogen production [1–3]. Many researches have reported that hydrogen can be produced efficiently from aqueous phase reforming (APR) of renewable biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol etc.) with high selectivity and hydrogen yield in a relatively mild reaction conditions (200–250 °C, 15–50 bar) without toxic by-products. Thus, the biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons can be converted to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and light alkanes with a low level of CO via various chemical reactions (e.g. C–C cleavage, water-gas shift (WGS), dehydration/hydration, methanation, Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reaction etc.) [4–15]. In general, the active catalysts for APR are claimed to have a high catalytic activity for the WGS reaction and a sufficiently high catalytic activity for the C–C bond cleavage. Group VIII metals, especially Pt, have shown higher activities for the C–C cleavage than other metals. However, the high cost of noble metals is a significant drawback for their use in industrial applications. In previous APR study on the Pt loading in ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 support [16], the hydrogen production rate as a function of the Pt loading increased up to 7 wt% Pt loading and then approached a steady-state value of approximately 37.8 cc/gcat·min. Thus, it is remains a challenge to reduce the expensive Pt loading by the introduction of second metal (M) to Pt catalyst in the APR. Of the available Pt-M bimetallic catalytic systems, it is widely accepted that the Pt–Re bimetallic catalyst has demonstrated good catalytic performance for hydrogen productivity and carbon conversion to gas [12,13]. However, it still have high loadings of both precious metals with 3 wt% of each Pt and Re metals due to the expensive Re cost, which is similar to Pt although the loading of Pt is reduced by the addition of Re. Considering the high cost and overloading of platinum, Pt-based non-noble bimetallic catalysts (Pt-M catalysts) have received considerable attention as promising catalysts for cheaper second metals and to increase the activity on the Pt in the APR reaction [8,10,13]. Another important factor that affects the catalytic activity in the APR is the nature of the catalyst support. The type of support can significantly affect the catalytic performance of the platinum-based catalysts in the glycerol APR reaction [17,18]. Oxide supports such as Al2O3, SiO2 and ZnO are not sufficiently stable in the APR conditions due to their weak hydrothermal stability under high-temperatures through sintering (pore degradation) and phase transformation process [6,19]. Carbon-based supports such as activated carbon (AC) and carbon black were also examined; However despite their good hydrothermal stability with high a surface area, the catalytic activity of the APR is not sufficiently high due to the textural nature of the carbon support (e.g. irregular pore arrangement, broad distribution of pore sizes, high microporosity, and pore resistance in liquid-phase reactants). In this regard, the ordered mesoporous carbon materials can be considered as ideal supports for the APR due to their remarkable properties such as hydrothermal stability, uniform pore size distribution, and ordered pore structure [16]. In this work, we have investigated the effect of the bimetallic composition, Pt-M (Pt–Re, Pt–Mn, Pt–Fe, Pt–Cs, Pt–Ba, Pt–Ga, Pt–Ag, and Pt–Mo) and support (CMK-3, commercial AC and alumina) on the APR activity in order to develop a cheaper and efficient APR catalyst. The molar ratio of Pt:M in the optimum bimetallic composition is also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The ordered mesoporous carbon, CMK-3, support was synthesized using SBA-15 as hard template and furfuryl alcohol as a carbon precursor according to the procedure reported in the literature [20–23]. The CMK-3 supported monometallic catalysts, Pt and Mn, and bimetallic catalysts, Pt-M (M: Re, Mn, Fe, Cs, Ba, Ga, Ag and Mo), were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6∙6H2O (Acros, 99.9%), HReO4 (Alfa, 99%), Mn(NO3)2·H2O (Aldrich, 99%), Fe(NO3)3∙6H2O (Aldrich, 99%), CsNO3 (Aldrich, 99%), Ba(NO3)2 (Kanto, 99%), Ga(NO3)3∙6H2O (Aldrich, 99%), AgNO3 (Aldrich, 99%), and (NH4)6Mo7O24∙4H2O (Aldrich, 99%), respectively. The CMK-3 supported bimetallic Pt–Mn catalysts with different mole ratios of 1:0.5 to 1:3 (Pt:Mn) were also prepared by impregnating the support with an aqueous solution using the same procedure. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and reduced via heating under a hydrogen flow rate of 50 cc/min. The reduction temperature was linearly increased from room temperature to 350 °C, and then maintained at this temperature for 12 h. The samples were subsequently cooled with a nitrogen flow for 6 h. For comparison, Pt–Mn supported on commercial activated carbon (Aldrich) and commercial alumina (γ-Al2O3, Strem Chemical) were also prepared using the incipient wetness method and are denoted as Pt–Mn/AC and Pt–Mn/alumina, respectively."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized using various analytic techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and CO chemisorption. Before the characterization, all the samples were reduced under a hydrogen flow rate of 50 cc/min at 350 °C. The powder XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Multiplex instrument using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (1.6 kW). The TEM images were taken from the thin edges of particles supported on a porous carbon grid, using a Philips Tecnai G220 device operated at 200 kV. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 volumetric adsorption analyzer. Before the adsorption measurements, all samples were outgassed at 300 °C for 5 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the apparent surface area from adsorption data obtained at P/P 0 values between 0.05 and 0.2. The total volume of the micropores and mesopores was calculated using the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P 0 = 0.95. The pore size distributions were calculated through analysis of the adsorption branch of the nitrogen physisorption isotherm using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The TPR measurements were carried out in a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min. For the TPR measurements, a mixed stream of H2 (3 cc/min) and N2 (27 cc/min) was used for 0.1 g of the catalyst sample. The CO chemisorption experiments (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 chemi) were conducted in order to measure the metal dispersion of the catalysts."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test An APR reaction of 10 wt% ethylene glycol (EG) was performed in a fixed bed reactor system with an up-flow liquid feeding system that has been described elsewhere [16]. The reactor was a stainless steel tube with a height of 360 mm and an inner diameter of 3/8 inch. Before performing the APR reaction, the catalyst was subjected to a H2 reduction step under 50 cc/min flow at 350 °C (heating rate: 1.0 °C/min) for 6 h. After the reduction, the reforming reaction was performed with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2.0 h−1 at 250 °C under 45 atm. An aqueous feed of 10 wt% EG was continuously fed into the reactor at a pumping rate of 0.1 cc/min using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump. The effluent gas products were measured using a gas chromatograph (6100 GC, Young Lin Instrument Co.) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and flame ionization detector. The H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and hydrocarbons in the effluent gas were detected using Carboxen 1000 (1/8 in × 15 ft) and GS-GASPRO (0.32 μm × 15 m) columns, respectively. The acquired data were calculated according to following definitions as described previously in the literature [5]. H 2 yield ( % ) = H 2 produced experimentally H 2 calculates according to theoretical quantity × 100 H 2 selectivity ( % ) = H 2 produced experimentally C atoms produced in gas products × 1 R × 100 where R is the H2/CO2 reforming ratio of 5/2 for ethylene glycol.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Support and catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Support and catalyst characterizations The structure of the ordered mesoporous carbon material CMK-3 and CMK-3 supported catalysts were analyzed using a series of different characterization techniques, including XRD, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. Fig. 1 (a) shows the low angle XRD patterns of the supports (SBA-15 and CMK-3) and supported catalysts (1 wt% Pt/CMK-3, 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3, and 1 wt% Pt–Mn (1:1)/CMK-3) examined via the XRD measurements. The crystalline phases according to the wide-angle XRD patterns and typical TEM image of the 1 wt% Pt–Mn (1:1)/CMK-3 are also shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1(a), the XRD pattern of CMK-3 clearly confirms the successful replication of the ordered mesoporous carbon with the two-dimensional (2-D) hexagonal space group (p6mm) from the SBA-15 mesoporous silica hard template. Thus, the SBA-15 and CMK-3 show three distinct XRD peaks, which can be indexed as (100), (110), and (200), reflecting a highly ordered mesoporous structure [24]. After impregnation of the Pt, Mn, and Pt–Mn metals into the CMK-3, there were no changes in XRD patterns, indicating that all metals were well dispersed in the supports. In the wide-angle powder XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 1(b), it was found that the CMK-3 support and 1wt% Pt–Mn (1:1)/CMK-3 catalysts retained a diffuse diffraction peak appearing near 2θ = 23°, indicating an amorphous carbon-like nature due to the CMK-3 support using the furfuryl alcohol as a carbon precursor. XRD pattern for Pt or Mn metal showed no distinct diffraction peaks (Fig. 1 (b)). This indicates that Pt and Mn metals are highly dispersed in the CMK-3 support. The intrinsic XRD pattern of the Pt displayed three diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ = 39.7, 46.2 and 67.5°, which correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) X-ray diffractions for typical polycrystalline Pt face-centered cubic phase. On the other hand, Pt–Mn bimetallic CMK-3 catalyst shows three diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 40.0, 46.5 and 67.9°, which are not in accordance with those of the pure Pt metal. The similar result was reported by Zeng and Bonakdarpour [25,26]. They also analyzed the XRD patterns for Pt, Pt–Co and Pt–Mn–Co and reported that Pt (111) diffraction peak is shifted to a higher angle (2θ = 40.3°) as Pt–Co and Pt–Mn–Co forms alloy. The average particle size of the Pt–Mn particles calculated using Scherrer's equation was 5.2 nm. The TEM images of 1 wt% Pt–Mn (1:1 M ratio)/CMK-3 sample is displayed in Fig. 1(c). As shown in Fig. 1(c), the highly ordered mesoporous structure with a mesostructure comprising parallel porous channels and carbon rods was observed, and the average size of the majority of Pt–Mn nanoparticles remains at approximately 4–5 nm. This TEM result is in good agreement with the result of the wide-angle XRD patterns. Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distributions of the CMK-3 support, 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3, 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3, and 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the ordered meosoporous carbons exhibited the typical Type IV curve with sharp capillary condensation steps and narrow pore size distributions which indicate a well-defined porous structure. After the impregnation of the Pt, Mn, and Pt–Mn into the CMK-3, there were no changes the isotherms, indicating that all metals are well dispersed in the supports. These results are consistent with the XRD results. The detailed structural properties of all catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of the CMK-3 support, mono (1 wt% Pt/CMK-3, 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3) and bimetallic catalyst (1 wt% Pt-Mn/CMK-3) used to investigate the effect of the metal/support interaction. The TPR pattern of the CMK-3 support exhibited a single broad peak over 500–700 °C, which was attributed to the methane emission resulting from the hydrogenation of the surface functional groups on the carbon material support [27–29]. However, the TPR profiles of the CMK-3 supported catalysts (1 wt% Pt/CMK-3, 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3 and 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3) are exhibited two reduction peaks accompanying the broad hydrogen consumption peaks of the CMK-3 support. The TPR profiles of the 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3 and 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalyst exhibited a distinct reduction peak of the metal itself, whereas the 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3 catalyst was observed with a broader peak overlapping the peak of the CMK-3 support. With the addition of Mn into Pt on the CMK-3 support (1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalyst), a single sharp peak was observed at a slightly shifted position compared with the Pt peak. Thus, the reduction profiles of the bimetallic catalysts do not contain peaks in the same region as the CMK-3 supported monometallic catalysts (1 wt% Pt/CMK-3 and 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3). This is as an indication of more formations of the alloy particles. The actual amount of hydrogen consumed was estimated through the integration of each reduction signal by considering with only metal peak, each value of 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3, 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3, and 1 wt% Pt–Mn (1:1)/CMK-3 were 0.24, 0.34 and 0.51 mmol/g, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the chemisorption results for the various 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3, 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3, and different supported 1 wt% Pt–Mn (1:1) catalysts used in this study. On the 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3 catalyst, the irreversible CO uptake indicates a metal dispersion of 49.9%, based on the assumption of a CO:M ratio of unity. We note that the low CO chemisorption value with 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3 catalyst, as well as the decrease in the CO chemisorption values observed in our work following the Mn addition, was the same results of the Pt–Re/carbon catalyst reported by King [13]."
7,Effect of second metal addition in Pt-based CMK-3 catalysts on the APR reaction,"3.2 Effect of second metal addition in Pt-based CMK-3 catalysts on the APR reaction In order to improve the hydrogen production in the APR reaction of the EG, the effect of the second metal addition in the 1 wt% Pt-based CMK-3 catalysts was examined and the results are shown in Table 2. Eight different metals (Re, Fe, Cs, Ba, Ga, and Ag) including reducible oxides (Mn and Mo) were used and the atomic ratio of the Pt to the second metal was fixed at 1:1 molar ratio. It can be seen from Table 2 that the hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield with the addition of the second metal in the same CMK-3 support decreased in the following order: Pt–Mn > Pt–Fe > Pt–Re > Pt > Pt–Cs > Pt–Ba > Pt–Ga > Pt–Mo > Pt–Ag. Thus, the highest hydrogen production rate was obtained over the 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalyst from the catalysts applied, whereas, the Pt–Re/CMK-3 catalyst obtained both higher conversion to gas and higher alkane selectivity. This latter results was in good agreement with the data from our result with the CMK-3 supported Pt–Re catalyst. Interestingly, the CMK-3 supported Pt–Mn, Pt–Re, and Pt–Fe catalysts were promoted to catalytic activity through the addition of a second metal in the Pt compared with the Pt monometallic catalyst. In particular, Mn is well known as a promoting metal that is favorable for water-gas shift reaction compared with the other metal oxides for CO oxidation reactions and the Pt–Mn alloys supported on carbon produced some enhancement in the kinetics of the oxygen–reduction reaction (ORR) relative to the monometallic Pt supported catalysts [14,15,30]. The addition of Mn into Pt could induce increases in the reducibility and alloy formation which is responsible for the enhancement of the catalytic performance in the APR accentuating the hydrogen production rate for the Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalyst relative to 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3 catalyst as shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 3."
8,Effect of the catalyst support and Pt–Mn molar ratio,"3.3 Effect of the catalyst support and Pt–Mn molar ratio The CO chemisorption and catalytic performance of CMK-3 supported Pt, Mn, and different supported Pt–Mn (1:1, molar ratio) catalysts in the APR of 10 wt% EG are listed in Table 3. The CO chemisorption was performed in order to determine the CO uptake and metal dispersion. As can be seen in Table 3, the effect of the active component on the catalytic activity in the same CMK-3 supports is as follows: 1 wt% Mn < 1 wt% Pt < 1 wt% Pt–Mn. The 1 wt% Mn/CMK-3 catalyst showed little activity in the APR reaction of EG due to the low value of CO uptake and low metal dispersion. This means that the Mn metal itself did not uptake CO significantly. However, the addition of Mn to the Pt catalyst has a higher catalytic activity than the monometallic Pt catalyst even though it has a low CO uptake and low metal dispersion. This indicates that the increase of the reducibility and alloy formation of the Pt and Mn is responsible for the enhancement of the catalytic performance. Fig. 4 shows the rate of hydrogen production for the supported 1 wt% Pt–Mn catalysts with different supports such as CMK-3, AC, and alumina. It can be seen that the three different supported Pt-Mn catalysts exhibit a relatively constant rate of hydrogen production with time on stream. This implies that all catalysts are stable during the overall APR reaction without deactivation, which should lead to a decrease in the hydrogen production rate. The rate of hydrogen production was greatly affected by the type of support employed and decreased in the following order 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 > 1 wt% Pt–Mn/AC > 1 wt% Pt–Mn/alumina. Thus, the CMK-3 supported catalyst, 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 exhibited better hydrogen production and hydrogen yield than the commercial AC and alumina supported catalyst (1 wt% Pt–Mn/AC, 1 wt% Pt–Mn/alumina). This superior APR activity of the 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalyst may be attributed to the ordered pores and opened mesopores interconnected within the CMK-3 support structure, which is effective for both good accessibility of the liquid-phase reactant to catalytic active sites and an easy escape for the gas products (e.g. H2, CO2, CO, and alkanes) from catalytic active site of metal without a diffusion resistance [31], whereas the 1 wt% Pt–Mn/alumina and 1 wt% Pt–Mn/AC catalysts with irregular porous structures were shown in the metal dispersions. These trends were also consistent with the result of CO uptake and metal dispersion described in Table 3. Based on these results, the hydrogen production of the APR reaction should relate closely to the nature and structural properties of the catalyst supports. Table 4 shows the chemisorption results and catalytic activities in the APR reaction of the EG over the 1 wt% Pt–Mn/CMK-3 catalysts with four different Pt:Mn molar ratios (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3). The catalytic activity of the Pt–Mn catalysts increased with the increase of the Pt:Mn ratio from 1:0.5 to 1:2, except the Pt:Mn = 1:3 molar ratio. The reason indicate that the addition of the Mn to Pt facilitated the C–C bond cleavage and transformation of CO to CO2 in the APR. Moreover the addition in the Mn content to the Pt can be enhance the activity of the CO oxidation [15]. Thus, Mn itself does not participate in the reforming reaction as a C–C bond cleavage unlike Pt, but rather it acts as a promoter to improve the catalytic activity. The same trend was found in the results in this study, a high Mn ratio at Pt:Mn = 1:3 demonstrated a significantly lower activity than the monometallic 1 wt% Pt/CMK-3. From this result, it can be understood that a part of the Pt active sites is covered through the addition of the excess Mn, resulting in a decrease in the catalytic activity. This hypothesis is demonstrated by the CO chemisorptions results of all the Pt–Mn bimetallic catalysts. Since manganese has the little effect on the CO consumption during the chemisorption (Table 3), the CO uptakes of all the Pt–Mn bimetallic catalysts come mainly from the Pt metals. Accordingly, it can be considered that as the amount of manganese increased to 3 mol, the gradually decreased metal dispersion from 49.9 to 19.7% due to the partial coverage of the Pt active sites by the some manganese. The similar result was reported by Huber et al. [10]. They also conducted the APR of EG over supported Pt and Pd bimetallic catalysts and reported that when large amount of Ni or Co is added to the Pt catalyst, some of the metals which do not form alloy with the Pt can cause the catalyst deactivation. In addition, the H2 yield and selectivity of the Pt–Mn catalyst were higher than the Pt–Re catalyst. In the APR reaction of the EG, the theoretical reforming ratio of the hydrogen to carbon dioxide was 2.5 [32]. The present APR results of the Pt–Mn catalyst on the reforming ratio of the hydrogen to carbon dioxide was close to this theoretical value. This indicates that the addition of Mn was facilitated by the main reaction as a promoter in the reforming reaction without the H2 consuming reaction. From the above results, it can be suggested that the Pt–Mn catalyst not only facilitated C–C bond cleavage reaction but also inhibited the C-O bond cleavage and dehydration in the APR reaction."
9,Conclusions,"In the APR of the EG, the effect of bimetallic compositions (Pt–Re, Pt–Mn, Pt–Fe, Pt–Cs, Pt–Ba, Pt–Ga, Pt–Ag, and Pt–Mo) and supports (CMK-3, AC, and alumina) were studied. Among these bimetallic compositions, the addition of Mn to the Pt/CMK-3 bimetallic catalyst exhibited good yield and production rates for hydrogen than the monometallic catalysts and other bimetallic catalysts used, whereas the addition of Re to Pt/CMK-3 increased carbon to gas conversion. These results indicate that Mn itself does not participate in the reforming reaction as a C–C bond cleavage unlike Pt, but rather that it acts as a promoter to improve the catalytic activity. For the effect of the support type, the CMK-3 support showed a better activity compared with the activated carbon and alumina. Also, the ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 supported bimetallic catalyst demonstrated good conversion and selectivity for hydrogen production compared with the other supports due to the easy accessibility of the liquid-phase reactant resulting from its unique structure.This suggests that the Pt-Mn/CMK-3 catalyst is very efficient in developing a much cheaper and highly efficient APR catalyst due to its alloy formation and mesoporous structure of the support."
