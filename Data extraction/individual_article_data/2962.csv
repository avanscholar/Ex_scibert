0,Introduction,"The production of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters is of great industrial interest because of their direct use as biodiesel. Most of the biodiesel currently produced uses rapeseed or soybean oil, methanol and an alkaline catalyst. The main products of the reaction are fatty esters and glycerin. The high value of vegetable oils as food products makes production of a cost-effective fuel very challenging [1]. However, crude oils, animal fats and waste cooking oils can also be converted into biodiesel. Some problems with processing these low cost oils are related to the presence of water and free fatty acids [2]. The transesterification of vegetable oils using supercritical alcohols is an alternative for biodiesel industrial production. Recent experimental studies of non-catalytic transesterification by Saka and Kusdiana [3,4] have shown that the process is not sensitive to both free fatty acids and water contents, and high reaction rates are observed at conditions close to the critical properties of methanol. Non-edible vegetable oils constitute another attractive option for biodiesel production. In the present work, the transesterification of fodder radish—Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiferus Stokes oil (a non-edible vegetable oil) in supercritical alcohols is studied in order to find optimum operating conditions. Fodder radish oil has been regarded as an interesting option to produce biodiesel in Brazil, since the seeds have high oil content and the oil can be easily recovered by pressing. The plant has rapid development and has been used for green fertilization [5]. The study of the supercritical transesterification with ethanol, besides like that of methanol, is justified considering the large production of ethanol from renewable resources in South America. In the present work, a phase equilibrium engineering analysis is applied to the transesterification of fodder radish oil in supercritical ethanol and methanol to study the influence of the pressure and a single phase condition in the transesterification reaction. Phase equilibrium engineering is the design of the phase condition required for a given process. This design is made on the basis of modeling of phase equilibria, knowledge of the phenomenological behavior or experimental information. Examples of phase equilibrium engineering applied to reaction and separation process can be seen elsewhere [6,7]. In this study, direct observations and modeling of the phase behavior is carried out in order to find feasible homogeneous operating conditions at moderated pressures. Then, the different variables affecting the non-catalytic transesterification reaction are evaluated to set the operating conditions and to demonstrate the feasibility of the operating conditions proposed previously. The best values of the variables in the experimental range studied are determined by applying a Doehlert design of experiments [8] and response surface methodology to determine how these variables influence the reaction. The results obtained are also interesting from the point of view of the continuous process considering that when there is a single phase in the system the global density of the reaction mixture controls the residence time for a given flow rate and reactor volume."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials R. sativus L. oil extracted by cold press oil was used as vegetable oil. The molar mass of fodder radish oil was calculated as 900.3g/mol on the basis on its fatty acid composition (Table 1 ), the oil acid number is (0.713mg(KOH)/g(OIL)). Ethanol (99.5%), methanol (99.7%) and heptane (99.%) were purchased from Anedra. Methyl heptadecanoate (>99%) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich."
3,Equipment,"2.2 Equipment Supercritical biodiesel reactions were carried out in batch mode. A stainless steel tubular reaction cell with an internal volume of 32cm3 (1.5cm of internal diameter) was used to carry out the transesterification of crude R. sativus L. oil in supercritical ethanol and methanol. The same reaction cell was used to determine the phase behavior of the reaction. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental equipment, which was similar to the one used by Hegel et al. [9]. Basically, the reaction cell has two 1cm thick glass windows, which allow the experimental phase behavior observation. A camera (Mitzu cyber-eye) placed in front of one of the windows records the phase behavior. Two electric resistances of 450W connected to a temperature controller (Novus N480D) were used to heat the reaction cell. The reaction cell also has an external aluminum jacket to act as a solid thermostat. A PT-100 platinum resistance thermometer placed in the external aluminum jacket measures the temperature with an error of ±2K. The pressure inside the reaction cell is measured by a high temperature pressure gauge (Dynisco PG4 series). The entire system is isolated by a fiberglass mat to allow a better temperature control. The reactor also has a feed line to load a given amount of co-solvent."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The experimental procedure was carried out as follows. The reactor was first loaded with a given amount of oil and alcohol, previously weighed in a balance (Sartorius GE412). Then different molar ratios of the reagents were studied and the residual air was evacuated from the reaction cell by flushing it with nitrogen. After the charge of reagents the entire system was assembled, and the temperature was raised up to the desired value as follows. Initially, the temperature controller was adjusted to give a heating rate of 15K/min up to 493K. Then, the system was left at 493K for 6min in order to stabilize the pressure inside. Later, the temperature controller was set to a heating rate of 10K/min up to the reaction final temperature. The total heating time was approximately 33min. However, previous studies indicated that there is almost no reaction at temperatures below 540K [3,4]. The reaction time was arbitrarily assumed as the time the reactor was kept at the selected temperature level. When the reaction finished, the heating was turned off and the reactor was air-cooled to quench the reaction. Considering the heating and cooling periods and the temperature range studied, there is an uncertainty of reported and true reaction times that ranges from 5 to 8min. The phase behavior of the system at different temperature and pressure conditions was recorded by a video camera. Unreacted alcohol present in the products of the reaction was separated in a vacuum oven at 343K and 25mmHg. Without the presence of alcohol, the biodiesel and glycerin become practically immiscible. Separation between biodiesel and glycerol was just performed by gravimetric precipitation. Triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides and fatty acid methyl esters remained only in the biodiesel sample after separating methanol and glycerol due to the very low solubilities of the triglycerides and derivatives in the glycerol phase. The biodiesel phase was separated by aspiration and then analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the ester contents by weight fraction. Triglycerides, diglycerides and monoglycerides in the biodiesel phase were not analyzed. However, according to Eq. (1) and because molecular weight of triglycerides is similar at three times that of fatty esters (e.g. MWTriolein: 885.4 and MWM.Oleate =296.5) conversion of transesterification reaction is related to the content of fatty esters [10] (1) X = 1 − M o l T G M o l T G 0 = 1 − M o l T G 0 − M o l F E / 3 M o l T G 0 = M o l F E / 3 M o l T G 0 X = M F E 3 M W F E M T G 0 M W T G ≈ M F E M T G 0 ≈ E s t e r _ c o n t e n t X: conversion: Mol TG : moles of triglycerides, diglycerides and monoglycerides; Mol TG0: moles of triglycerides loaded to the reactor. Mol FE : moles of fatty esters; M TG0: mass of triglycerides; M FE : mass of fatty esters; MW TG : molecular weight of oil; MW FE : mean molecular weight of fatty esters. It is important to mention that Eq. (1) is valid if decomposition of the vegetable oil or fatty esters is negligible. However, a detailed kinetic study of the transesterification reactions was out of the scope of the present work. The main goal was to analyze the ester content of the biodiesel phase to assure a minimum ester composition 96.5wt.% to verify one of the specifications of the European norm EN 14214 for biodiesel quality."
5,Analytical method,"2.4 Analytical method Ester content of biodiesel samples was analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC – Varian Star 3400 CX). The equipment was assembled with a flame ionization detector (FID) and capillary column (J&W Scientific, model DBwax, 30m length, 0.32mm inner diameter, and 0.25μm film thickness). The chromatographic conditions were selected according to BS EN 14103:2003. Hydrogen was used as the gas carrier at a flow rate of 1.5ml/min and at a split flow rate of 76ml/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 250 and 270°C, respectively. The oven temperature program consisted of starting at 120°C for 6min, a ramp of 7°C/min up to 210°C, a ramp of 15°C/min up to 250°C, and finally maintaining 250°C during 15minutes. Methyl heptadecanoate was used as internal standard. A stock solution of heptane with a known amount of internal standard was prepared (5mg/ml). A sample solution was also prepared in heptane (17mg/ml). The sample injected into the chromatograph consisted of 2μL of a solution prepared with 0.2ml of the internal standard stock solution and 0.3ml of the sample solution (2mg/ml of methyl heptadecanoate and 10mg/ml of reaction products)."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis The analysis of ester production by transesterification of R. sativus L. oil using supercritical alcohols was carried out by a Doehlert design of experiments [8]. This experimental design is very useful and offers advantages in relation to other designs. Doehlert designs are easily applied in variable optimization and they require fewer experiments in relation to central composite and Box-Behnken designs [11–13]. Ethanol studies: A three variable Doehlert design was applied in supercritical ethanol studies. The ester contents in the biodiesel samples, Yester%, were selected as the response variable. The variables or factors investigated were the reaction temperature, X T , the reaction time, X t , and the initial alcohol to oil molar ratio, X M . The selection of levels for each variable was based on previous works [9,14–16] and on preliminary studies carried out in our laboratory. The lowest temperature value was set at 568K and the highest was fixed at 598K. The reaction time varied between 15 and 29min, and the initial alcohol to oil molar ratio was studied in the 32:1 to 52:1 range for ethanol. Methanol studies: A two variable Doehlert design was applied to study the transesterification reaction with supercritical methanol. Different authors [3,4,9,10,17,18] generally agree that high alcohol/oil ratios (40:1 methanol: vegetable oil) are required to obtain high conversions and high reaction rates. Based on this and on the previous results obtained with ethanol, the initial methanol/oil molar ratio of 39:1 was selected for these studies. The reaction temperature, X T and the reaction time, X t , were chosen for the independent input variables, and the methyl ester contents in the biodiesel samples, Yester%, were used as the dependent output variables. The lowest temperature value was set at 533K and the highest at 609K. The reaction time varied between 5 and 27min. Once these levels were selected, the Doehlert design of experiments [8] was applied. The Doehlert matrix and the experimental conditions studied in this work are presented in Table 2 for ethanol and Table 3 for methanol. The first columns of data in Tables 2 and 3 show factor levels on a natural scale, and the next show the coded factor levels in the dimensionless co-ordinate. All the runs were performed at random. Three experiments were carried out at the central point level, coded as “0”, for experimental error estimation."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Experimental phase behavior,"3.1 Experimental phase behavior The ester contents obtained in the experiments are presented in Tables 2 and 3. A single-phase system at the end of the reaction was observed. As an example, Fig. 2 shows images of a typical evolution of the phase behavior during the non-catalytic transesterification reaction with ethanol, at the reported operating conditions. Fig. 2A and B show that the system exhibits liquid–liquid–vapor (LLV) equilibria at ambient and moderate temperatures, respectively. Fig. 2D shows that at higher temperatures (such as 453K) the liquid phases become completely miscible and liquid–vapor (LV) equilibria can be observed. However, the system changes to a single-phase supercritical condition (Fig. 2H) at temperatures over 573K, and the pressure increase with temperature was moderate in all cases. Similar phase behavior results were obtained for methanol studies. However, higher pressures (reported in Table 3) at the final reaction temperatures were reached due to the higher vapor pressure of methanol. The observed phase behavior is probably due to the reactor global density used in this work. According to Hegel et al. [9], the global density (ρ g) defined as the total mass charged into the reactor divided by the reactor volume, is an important factor from a phase equilibrium engineering point of view. In the non-catalytic transesterification of soy oil with supercritical methanol, for example, a high global density (ρ g >0.8g/cm3) produced a steep increase in pressure when the liquid phase completely filled the volume of the reactor. At smaller global densities (ρ g <0.5g/cm3) the liquid–vapor (LV) equilibrium conditions prevailed up to 560K. However, it was observed that high efficiencies were achieved at temperatures over 550K and 10min of reaction, even in the LV phase regions [9]. This result partially explains why different operating conditions of temperature and pressure have been proposed for non–catalytic supercritical transesterification reactions [3,4,10,17,18]. In this work, different global densities were tested to work at pressures between 10 and 15MPa in ethanol experiments and in a range of 10–18MPa in methanol studies. As it is shown in the next section, in this range of pressure at the selected reaction temperatures, a single phase can be obtained according to predictions of the phase behavior of the reaction products effectuated with the Group Contribution and Association Equation of State, GCA-EOS. To avoid phase immiscibility in the range of temperature studied, a load reactor global density of 0.55g/cm3 was selected in ethanol studies to obtain working pressures no higher than 15MPa. On the other hand, a global density of 0.52g/cm3 was used in methanol experiments to obtain pressures lowers than 19MPa."
9,Modeling of the phase behavior and reaction thermal history,"3.2 Modeling of the phase behavior and reaction thermal history The GC-EOS equation was proposed by Skjold–Jørgensen [19]; the model is based on the generalized van der Waals partition function and the group contribution principle. Gros et al. [20] modified the equation by inclusion of a ‘group’ contribution associating term to the GC-EOS model (GCA-EOS). The application of a group contribution with association equation of state (GCA-EOS) to the supercritical processing of fatty oil derivatives with low molecular weight solvents has been extensively discussed by Ferreira et al. [21,22] and more recently by Andreatta et al. [23]. In previous works [9,24], experimental observations of the multiple phase behavior between the reactants and products of the transesterification of vegetable oils (triacylglycerols, fatty esters, methanol and glycerin) were compared with modeling predictions using GCA-EOS. The observed phase envelope predictions were in agreement with experimental trajectories of the reactive system. Andreatta et al. [25] measured LL and LLV equilibria data for the system methyl oleate–methanol–glycerin, and used GCA-EOS to represent these experimental data. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the phase behavior of the system methyl laureate and methanol predicted by the GCA-EOS compared with equilibrium data for this system recently reported by Shimoyama et al. [26]. The observed predictions of the GCA-EOS agree well with the experimental results. In another example, Fig. 4 shows the phase transitions reported by Hegel et al. [9,27] for the biodiesel reaction of soybean oil with supercritical methanol in the presence of propane as co-solvent. In this special case, the presence of propane in the reaction system (in a concentration of 10wt.%) decreased the critical temperature. Fig. 4 also shows the phase envelope prediction of the GCA-EOS that encloses the liquid–vapor zone for the initial reactive mixture (soy oil+methanol+propane) and the final products (esters+methanol+glycerol+propane). Predictions of the GCA-EOS are in agreement with the experimental observations in the liquid–vapor state at low temperature and pressure (430K and 5MPa) up to the supercritical state at a temperature of 520K and pressures greater than 10MPa. Hence, the GCA-EOS model can be applied to explore the operating conditions in the reactor. The critical properties for the esters used in this work were predicted by a group contribution method [28]. The critical properties for the alcohols are those available in the site of NIST [29]. The GCA-EOS group energy and interaction parameters for non-associating groups are those of Espinosa [30,31]. For self-associating groups or groups with cross-association the parameters reported by Ferreira et al. [22] and Gros et al. [20] are used. The alcohol, glycerin and esters interaction specific parameters are those of Andreatta et al. [25]. Ethanol studies: Fig. 5 gives the predicted phase envelopes and critical points of the system composed by ethyl eicosaenoate+glycerin+ethanol (3:1:39 molar ratio). Here, the ethyl eicosaenoate represents the fatty acid ethyl esters produced by the transesterification according to the fatty acid composition of the vegetable oil (Table 1) and the calculation proposed by Espinosa et al. [30]. Phase envelopes and the critical points were predicted based on the GCA-EOS model. Here, it can be seen the two phase liquid-vapor region and the homogeneous regions (liquid, vapor and supercritical) for the reaction products. The GCA-EOS predicts a liquid phase at pressures higher than 11MPa in a range of temperature of 568–598K. However, an appropriate global density of the reaction mixture has to be selected to obtain a single phase at the lower pressure. Fig. 5 also shows the thermal history of three experimental runs for the different initial ethanol to oil molar ratios (32:1, 42:1 and 52:1) studied in supercritical ethanol transesterification for a global density of 0.55g/cm3. The figure reveals that the predictions agree with the experimental observations of the phase conditions at the final reaction temperature. In fact, a liquid single-phase condition is predicted at the end of the reaction, when almost all the vegetable oil has been converted into fatty ethyl esters, and a near supercritical state can be observed. Methanol studies: Fig. 6 shows the predicted GCA-EOS phase envelope of the reaction products assuming a complete conversion of the fodder radish oil initially present in a molar ratio of 1:39 with methanol (methyl eicosaenoate+glycerol+methanol=3:1:36). The final operating conditions studied in this work and previously detailed in Table 3, can also be observed. According to the GCA-EOS predictions and the experimental observations, in the range of temperature studied, a global density of 0.52g/cm3 is adequate to guarantee moderate pressures and a single phase of the reaction products. However, at these conditions the transesterification is carried out in a condensed liquid phase and according to the GCA-EOS prediction, it is necessary to increase the temperature over 650K to have a supercritical phase. Fig. 6 also reveals that the operating conditions at temperatures of 533 and 552K are near the saturated liquid phase from the reaction products point of view. However, the ester content analyzed remains low and an immiscibility region (liquid–supercritical fluid) is observed due to the presence of components of higher molecular weight like diglycerides and triacylglycerols. It has been observed that an increment in the reaction time from 5 to 27min produces an increase in the ester content from 21% to 63% at a temperature of 552K. On the other hand, the same increment in the reaction time at 590K produces a complete conversion of the vegetable oil into esters."
10,Model fitting of fodder radish oil transesterification with supercritical alcohols and analysis of response,"3.3 Model fitting of fodder radish oil transesterification with supercritical alcohols and analysis of response The multivariable analysis of data is a powerful statistical technique used for studying the effect of several factors and their interactions over one or more response variables in a process [11–13]. Response surface methodology has also been used for biodiesel production optimization [5,18,32]. Ethanol studies: Response surface methodology was performed on experimental data. A lineal regression quadratic model was obtained as shown in Eq. (2) for the ester content in the transesterification with supercritical ethanol as a function of the three coded variables: (2) Y ester % = 92.943 + 3.729 X T + 6.369 X t − 12.465 X M − 14.333 X M 2 − 11.801 X T X t Yester%: ester content %; X T : coded variable for temperature; X t : coded variable for time; X M : coded variable for methanol:oil initial molar ratio. The uncertainty and P-value associated with each coefficient of this model can be seen in Table 4 . The P-value criterion was used to conclude if a given factor is significant in the experimental range studied. Every time the P-value is lower than the uncertainty level, α for the test, the statistical hypothesis is considered significant [11,13]. According to its P-values, the regression model obtained for the transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical ethanol demonstrates a good adjustment with experimental data and is also statistically significant for an uncertainty level, α, for the test lower than 0.065. The coefficient of determination R 2 approaches one (0.92) indicating that the regression model has a good predictive capacity. Fig. 7 plots experimental versus correlated values for biodiesel production from R. sativus L. oil using ethanol. The figure reveals that there are no tendencies in the regression fit; hence the model explains the experimental range studied adequately. According to the P-values in Table 4, from the statistical analysis, and in the experimental range studied, the EtOH:oil molar ratio is the most important factor on the transesterification of the R. sativus L. oil with a negative effect (b XM: −12.465). In addition the P-value (0.00593) is lower than α =0.065, showing that the effect ethanol to oil molar ratio in the reaction is significantly greater than its uncertainty. Silva et al. [15] studied the transesterification of soybean oil at 598K with supercritical ethanol and different molar ratios of ethanol to oil from 10:1 to 100:1 in continuous mode. The authors observed higher reaction conversions on varying this process variable from 10:1 to 40:1, however, no significant effects were observed for molar ratios of ethanol to oil between 40:1 and 100:1. Similar results were obtained by Varma and Madras [16] for the transesterification of castor oil and linseed oil with supercritical ethanol. In the transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical ethanol an increment of the alcohol to oil molar ratio from 32:1 to 42:1 also increased the level of ester content in the reaction products. However, an ethanol to oil molar ratio of 52:1 produced ester contents significantly lower in the range of temperatures and reaction times studied in this work. The negative coefficient for the molar ratio of ethanol to oil (b XM: −12.465) is pointing this effect in the regression model. Fig. 8 shows the response surface for ester contents (Esters %) in biodiesel samples for an ethanol/oil molar ratio of 42:1, as well as the experimental data obtained for this molar ratio (Table 2). It shows a good correlation with the model. Fig. 8 helps to identify how the interactions between temperature and reaction time influence the reaction. Time and temperature of the reaction both had a positive effect in the final content of esters (b Xt: 6.369, b XT: 3.729) and they are statistically significantly with P-values lower than α =0.065 of significance level. The maximum ester % is achieved at the maximum temperature level. Also the maximum ester % is obtained at the maximum level for reaction time. This result is in agreement with previous results obtained by other authors for the transesterification of soybean oil [15] and linseed oil [16] with supercritical ethanol. On the other hand, the interaction between time and temperature according to the model has a negative effect (b XT.Xt: −11,801, P-value: 0,03386). For example for an ethanol to oil molar ratio of 42 (Fig. 8), there is an expected increase in ester % as temperature increases for reaction times between 15 and 25min. For reaction times over 25min, the model predicts a decrease in esters % with an increase in temperature. A decomposition of the esters because of high temperatures and reaction time could explain this result [14,33]. Vieitez et al. [14] studied the production of soybean biodiesel with supercritical ethanol in a 42mL continuous reactor at 623K observing an ethyl esters decomposition of more than 25% by weight fraction at the lower flow rate (0.8mL/min) and almost 10% by weight fraction at the highest flow rate (2.5mL/min). The results obtained in this work are in agreement with these observations and the model is predicting a decreasing amount of fatty ethyl esters at the highest temperature with increasing the exposure time. This result could explain partially the negative influence observed for the molar ratio of ethanol to oil because thermal decomposition of fatty esters could be more important for higher ethanol concentrations. The quadratic interactions between time/molar ratio (b Xt.XM) and temperature/molar ratio (b XT.XM) both had a positive effect; however, they are not significant according to the P-values (Table 4) and therefore their effects in the model are not statistically greater than the uncertainties associated with its determination. The terms representing the quadratic influence of temperature (b Xt2) and time (bXt2) are also not significant in the model with P-values much greater than α =0.065 significance level. The term representing the quadratic influence of the ethanol to oil molar ratio is very negative (b XM2: −14,333) and the P-value is 0.0133. This negative influence in the model suggests that there is a specific value for maximum response. Solving the homogeneous differential equation system (created by partial derivatives of Eq. (1)) it was obtained an optimal ethanol to oil molar ratio equal to 39:1 (Table 5 ). To check the model adequacy for predicting the maximum ester %, one additional experiment was carried out under the optimal conditions described in Table 5. Three replicate gas chromatography analyses indicated average contents of ethyl esters of 97.5%. The good agreement between the predicted and experimental results confirmed the validity of the model. The response surface obtained with the model at the optimum molar ratio (ethanol/oil: 39:1) shows a similar behavior to the one reported in Fig. 8. Methanol studies: Response surface methodology was also performed on experimental data obtained with supercritical methanol. Eq. (3) shows the lineal regression quadratic model, based on the coded values of the variables. As it was explained in the previous section, in these experiments the molar ratio of methanol to oil was fixed in 39:1 and two variables, time and temperature of the reaction were studied. (3) Y ester % = 45.7 + 30.4 X T + 31.236 X t + 13.857 X T X t X T : coded variable for temperature; X t : coded variable for time; Yester%: concentration of ester obtained by gas chromatograph. The good fit of the model and the high significance of the statistic test (low P-value of the hypothesis test) lead to a high explicated variance (99.16%) of the experimental data. Fig. 9 shows that there is not a particular tendency in the distribution of residues between the estimated values and the experimental ones, which is important from a statistical point of view. The response surface for ester content (Esters %) in biodiesel samples is shown in Fig. 10 , as well as the experimental data reported in Table 3. This figure helps to identify the how the interactions between the variables influence the reaction, within the range studied. The model based on the ester content shows in this case a barely quadratic response surface. It is like a plane with a marked slope toward the high values of the variables (temperature and reaction time). Thereafter, there is not a point of maximum inside the experimental domain of study. However, the results are satisfactory because these are showing a region of maximum yield. Table 7 shows the values of temperature and time to reach a complete transesterification of the fodder radish oil to esters in supercritical methanol when the initial molar ratio of alcohol to oil is 39:1. The studies of transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical methanol showed similar results to the ones obtained for supercritical ethanol. Both alcohols showed similar reactivity at a temperature of 590K and ester contents of 95–100% were obtained after 27–29min of reaction time. Table 6 shows that both variables (temperature and time) are important in the model with a positive effect in the final content of esters (b XT: 30.4, b Xt: 31.236) and they are statistically significantly with P-values lower than α =0.055 of significance level, in agreement with results obtained by others authors [3,4,9,10,17,18] for transesterification of vegetable oils with supercritical methanol. The interaction between the two variables (b XT.Xt: 13.857) is also positive and significant in the model, in contrast with the coefficient obtained in the model for the transesterification with supercritical ethanol. This suggests that the best values of ester content are obtained by combining the higher values of both variables (temperature and time) in the experimental range studied. Imahara et al. [33] studied the thermal stability of biodiesel in supercritical methanol observing that methyl oleate is stable at 543K, however, it becomes unstable at 573K and there is a clear decomposition of unsaturated esters with exposure time at temperatures higher than 623K. Fodder radish oil has a significant composition of C18:1, C20:1 and C22:1 (Table 1), indicating that it could be possible a degradation with temperature and time. This effect was not observed in the interactions between time and temperature studied in this work for the transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical methanol. Since the quadratic coefficients of the variables are positive there is no maximum in the range of variability for the experiments with supercritical methanol studied in this work. To find a maximum point it would be necessary to displace the experimental domain of the reaction time and temperature to higher values. In this way higher temperatures could have a negative effect in the methyl esters synthesis result [33]. The results obtained in this work for the transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical alcohols are indicating that fatty acid ethyl esters are less stable with temperature than fatty acid methyl esters. As in the study of transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical ethanol, the terms representing the quadratic influence of temperature (b XT2) and time (b Xt2) in the methyl ester content were not significant with P-value much greater than the α =0.055 significance level. The results are suggesting that in experimental range studied both, temperature and time, have a linear influence in the transesterification reaction with supercritical alcohols. The results derived from this study indicated that the Doehlert design is a powerful tool for optimizing the conditions for biodiesel production in supercritical alcohols."
11,Conclusions,"In the present work, a phase equilibrium engineering analysis, using the GCA-EOS model, was performed to explore the operating conditions in the reactor. Global densities of reactants in the cell of 0.55g/cm3 and 0.52g/cm3 were chosen for ethanol and methanol studies, respectively. In this way it was possible to reach a single-phase system at moderate pressures over the range of reaction temperatures studied. High ester contents in the reaction products were obtained. A Doehlert design has proven to be effective in the study and optimization of the variables affecting the supercritical ethanol and methanol transesterification process. For both alcohols studied lineal regression quadratic models were obtained to predict the ester content as a function of the variables. Analysis of the residues showed that the models predicted adequately the ester% over the experimental range considered. Optimal operating conditions (initial molar ratio of 39:1, a reaction temperature of 592K and 22min of reaction time) were selected from the lineal regression quadratic model derived from the three-variable Doehlert design applied to ethanol studies. Based on ethanol studies and other previous works, an initial molar ratio of 39:1 alcohol/oil was used in the methanol studies. A two variable Doehlert design was used to find the optimum conditions. Similar results to those of supercritical ethanol transesterification were obtained. The non-catalytic transesterification of fodder radish oil with supercritical alcohols can be performed with molar ratios of alcohols to oil in the range of 30:1 to 40:1 and temperatures of 583–590K. A homogenous phase with the advance of the reaction can be obtained at pressures of 11 and 14MPa, for supercritical ethanol and methanol, respectively, depending on the global density of the initial reactants used in the batch reaction process. Reaction times higher than 20min are required to obtain high ester contents (greater than 96% by weigh fraction) even when the reaction takes place in homogeneous phase conditions. Present results are important regarding the continuous process because in this case the residence time is directly related to the global density of the reaction mixture."
