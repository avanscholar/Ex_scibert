0,Introduction,"Solar-light-driven water splitting by semiconductor photocatalyst provides a sustainable way for renewable energy, which has been considered to be one of the most fascinating solutions to mitigate the energy and environmental issues [1–3]. Recently, lots of efforts have been devoted to synthesizing different kinds of photocatalysts, such as inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconducting polymers and organic–inorganic composites [4–6]. Among them, titanium dioxide and polymeric graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst are two of the most popular photocatalysts for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction [7,8]. However, narrow light absorption range and the relatively harsh synthesis conditions limit their application, respectively [9,10]. Overall, the rapid combination of photogenerated electrons and holes (photogenerated carriers), insufficient photoabsorption and surface reactive sites of the photocatalysts lead to the low hydrogen production rate [11–13]. Hence, a lot of efforts have been devoted to solving the above problems, such as noble metal depositing [14], introduce defects [15], doping impurity [16], photosensitizing [17], constructing heterojunction [18] and so on. Among these methods, the introduce of defects on the surface of semiconductor materials has attracted more and more attention, for it could change the electronic band structures, atom coordination number, carrier concentration, or optical absorption properties of the semiconductor materials [19,20]. Defects could be classified as anion vacancies, cation vacancies, vacancy associates, pits, distortions and disorders [21,22]. As one of the most common anion vacancies, the oxygen vacancy (OV) on the semiconductor surface could not only form an OV state between conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) which could narrow the band gap and expend the absorption range of semiconductors to the visible light range [23], but also act as electron scavengers delaying photogenerated carrier recombination during the photoreaction process [24]. There were a lot of studies that focused on the generation of OVs on the surface of photocatalysts. For example, Mao group introduced OVs on the surface layers of nanophase TiO2 by hydrogenation, which exhibited good solar-driven photocatalytic activity [1]. By introducing OVs on the surface of K4Nb6O17 ultrathin nanosheets, Bi et al. found the H2 evolution rate was extraordinarily enhanced by 20 times compared to the OVs-free bulk counterpart [25]. However, most preparation methods of these kind photocatalysts were subject to harsh reaction environment (high temperature and pressure), such as heat treatment under vacuum [26], hydrogen atmospheric reduction [27], hydro/solvothermal process [28] and so on. Consequently, it still is a great challenge and urgent task to establish a facile and environmentally friendly approach to introducing OVs onto the photocatalyst surfaces, which would provide a large number of chances for studying the relationship between the observed complex phenomena and theories of hydrogen generation through light-driven water splitting [29,30]. Sillén structured bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Br, Cl, I) have been widely studied due to their special structure and good property, such as layered structure, high specific surface area, adequate chemical stability, and superior photocatalytic activity [31,32]. Particularly, BiOI has been considered as an excellent semiconductor photocatalytic material, which possesses a layered crystal structure ([Bi2O2]2+ slabs interleaved by double slabs of I−) and narrow band gap (1.7–1.9 eV) [33]. Thus, BiOI with strong absorption in the UV–Vis-light range exhibits superb photocatalytic activity for water purification and organic pollutants decomposition under solar light irradiation [33,34]. Whereas the poor conductivity of BiOI caused the fast recombination of photogenerated carrier, which limited its photocatalytic activity [35]. Unfortunately, it is well known that BiOI is not suitable as a photocatalyst for photocatalytic water splitting, for the conduction band minimum (CBM) energy (about −4.74 eV) of BiOI is lower than the reduction potential (about −4.44 eV) of H+/H2 [36]. Excitingly, according to the theoretical calculation results, Wang et al. predicted that the CBM energy of single-layer BiOI was to be located at −4.18 eV once the pH value of the solution was below 4.4, which would be higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 [37]. Hence, it is very meaningful to study whether BiOI can be used as a catalyst to decompose water into H2 under UV–Vis-light irradiation. In recent years, BiOI containing oxygen vacancies has been successfully synthesized by different methods, such as electroreduction followed annealed treatment method [24], in-situ method [34], low-frequency ultrasound method [38] and template method [39]. The properties of the resulting BiOI containing oxygen vacancies have been extensively studied in photodegradation of organic pollutants [24], photoelectrochemical N2 reduction [34], antibacterial photodynamic therapy [40] and so on. Herein, we demonstrated a facile, mild, yet unexplored route, for the preparation of kermesinus BiOI (K-BiOI) with abundant OVs under UV–Vis light irradiation in the vacuum condition. The successful introduction of OVs on the surface of K-BiOI led to the absorption range of K-BiOI significantly stretched. The systematical study of light driven water splitting property of K-BiOI without noble metal (Pt, Pd or Au as cocatalyst) loading has been carried out, and the K-BiOI exhibited a promising property in light driven water splitting of H2 production with a high hydrogen production rate (6.51 mmol g−1 h−1). Our work provided an intelligent design of OVs-activated photocatalytic materials (K-BiOI) for hydrogen evolution through an easily implemented strategy."

2,Fabrication of 3D flower-like orange BiOI (O-BiOI) sub-microsphere,"2.1 Fabrication of 3D flower-like orange BiOI (O-BiOI) sub-microsphere 0.48 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Aladdin Co.) and 0.02 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K30, average Mw 58000, Tianjin Chemical Reagent Research Co.) were dissolved in 12 mL ethanediol (Beijing Chemical Works) with continuous stirring. After additional agitation for 15 min, 0.17 g KI (Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) and 12 mL deionized water were slowly added into the above mixed solution under vigorously stirring. After stirred for 30 min, the resulting orange colloidal precipitate was transferred into a 30 mL stainless Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was naturally cooled down to the room temperature. Finally, the orange precipitates were collected and washed using distilled water and absolute alcohol for several times and dried at 60 °C. All the chemical reagents used in this work were of analytical grade and used directly without further purification."
3,Photocatalytic H2 evolution and fabrication of kermesinus BiOI (K-BiOI),"2.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution and fabrication of kermesinus BiOI (K-BiOI) The photocatalytic H2 production experiments were carried out in an online photocatalytic H2 generation system (CEL-PAEM-D8, CEAULIGHT Co., Ltd.) at 6 °C. A 300 W Xe lamp (CEAULIGHT, Co., Ltd.) was used as light source to simulate solar light. Briefly, 20 mg of O-BiOI photocatalyst was dispersed in a mixing solution containing 4 mL of methanol (Beijing Chemical Works) and 16 mL of deionized water. Before turning the 300 W xenon lamp on, the air in the reactor was evacuated by N2 for 30 min to ensure that the reaction environment was in a vacuum condition. The resultant hydrogen extracted for each hour and analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC7920-DTA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Then, the kermesinus precipitates were collected and washed using distilled water and absolute alcohol for several times. Finally, the K-BiOI or rK-BiOI samples were dried in a vacuum oven or blast oven at 40 °C for 12 h, respectively."
4,Electrochemistry study,"2.3 Electrochemistry study The three-electrode system was used to perform the transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance measurements using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation in a 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH 6.5), with Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode (3.0 M KCl), a Pt electrode as counter electrode, and BiOI photocatalyst as working electrodes. The 300 W Xe lamp was used as light source to simulate solar light. The Mott-Schottky curves were also collected with the three-electrode system, whose measurements were monitored at a fixed frequency of 1000 Hz with 5 mV amplitude. Potentials were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation (Eqn (1), E0 Ag/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C) [36]: (1) E RHE = E Ag / A g C l 0 + E Ag / A g C l + 0.059 p H"
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations Phase identification was made via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) performed on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with a monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation source (wavelength λ = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 20°≤2θ ≤ 80°. The morphologies of the as-obtained materials were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL, Japan, 5 kV), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2200FS, JEOL, Japan, 200 KV). The surface chemical composition and chemical states were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Kratos-Axis spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.71 eV), X-ray radiation (15 kV and 10 mA) and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the materials dispersed in KBr pellets were carried out on a PerkinElmer spectrum 430 FT-IR spectrometer. The visible photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were analyzed with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test was carried out by Bruker E500 EPR spectrometer at room temperature. The UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were characterized by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan), and the BaSO4 was used as reference. The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system included a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), and a photovoltaic cell [41]. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global Xenon Lamp Power) and a double-prism monochromator (Zolix SBP500) provided monochromatic light as the source light. N2 sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with a Quantachrome Nova 4200e."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Phase, morphology and structure","3.1 Phase, morphology and structure The composition and phase purity of the as-prepared BiOI samples were characterized by XRD firstly. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of BiOI samples before (O-BiOI) and after photocatalytic reaction (K-BiOI) and after reaction recovery (rK-BiOI). All the diffraction peaks were highly consistent with the data on Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards card 73-2062 (BiOI), indicating that the crystal phase (tetragonal phase) of BiOI didn’t change before and after the photocatalytic reaction. The insets in Fig. 1 show their photographs. It is noticed that the cell parameters (Table 1 ) of as-formed samples varied slightly, which indicated that there might be some changes on the surface of BiOI samples. The surface morphologies of O-BiOI, K-BiOI and rK-BiOI samples were studied by SEM and TEM. As displayed in Fig. 2 A and B, the 3D flower-like orange BiOI sub-microspheres with diameters of 550–850 nm built by nanoplates were detected. Compared to Fig. 2A, the nanoplates in Fig. 2C became smaller and denser. Moreover, the edges of BiOI sub-microspheres in Fig. 2D and F were more opaque than that in Fig. 2B, basically agreeing well with the results of SEM image (Fig. 2C). It was clear that the surfaces of BiOI sub-microspheres after photocatalytic reaction were destroyed. In order to further investigate the changes on the surface of BiOI in detail, HRTEM was introduced. Fig. 3 exhibits the HRTEM images of O-BiOI, K-BiOI and rK-BiOI samples. It was observed that there were lattice fringes of about 0.300 nm (Fig. 3A), which were agreed well with the {012} facet of the tetragonal BiOI [42]. As shown in Fig. 3B, the {001} facet of BiOI surface was disappeared after the photocatalytic reaction. In order to reveal structural changes, HRTEM images of other K-BiOI samples were provided (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. S1 A and B, the {001} facet of K-BiOI surface was disappeared after the photocatalytic reaction. And it's worth noting that the {001} facet appeared again on the subsurface of K-BiOI (Fig. S1 C). Thus, the {001} facet just disappeared on the surface, and still existed on the subsurface and center of K-BiOI. Interestingly, when the photocatalytic reaction was over and the K-BiOI was placed in the air at room temperature for a period of time, the {001} facet of BiOI surface appeared again (Fig. 3C). The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) images shown in Fig. 3D, it was found that the density of O atoms was significantly lower than that of Bi atoms. These phenomena further indicated the nanoplates on surfaces of BiOI sub-microspheres were changed during the photocatalytic reaction. In order to study the changes during the photocatalytic reaction, the XPS and EPR spectra were adopted to analyze the features of the related samples. We have investigated the surface (3–5 nm) chemical composition and chemical states of the O-BiOI and K-BiOI through XPS. As displayed in Fig. 4 A, the XPS survey spectra demonstrate that all the peaks were only Bi, O, I and C elements [43]. Fig. 4B, C and D show the high-resolution scans of Bi 4f, I 3d and O 1s, respectively. Compared to O-BiOI, the Bi 4f5/2 (164.0 eV) and Bi 4f7/2 (158.7 eV) peaks of K-BiOI displayed a shift towards a lower binding energy (Fig. 4B), which revealed that the K-BiOI had more low-charge Bi ions and more oxygen defects than O-BiOI [38]. More importantly, compared to O-BiOI, the peak of Bi-O bond (529.5 eV) on the surface of K-BiOI was very weak, indicating that a lot of Bi-O bonds on the surface of K-BiOI were broken (Fig. 4D, E and F). While the peaks of OVs (531.4 eV) and absorbed oxygen (532.6 eV) were enhanced [34,44]. These spectra indicated that the surface composition was changed during the photocatalytic reaction. The EPR test was employed to further confirm the changes. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the K-BiOI sample exhibited a higher EPR signal than O-BiOI and rK-BiOI samples at about g = 2.0, which was a typical signal of oxygen vacancies (OVs) [24,45]. Thus, the color change of BiOI samples was due to the introduction of OVs on the surface. And these phenomena indicated that the OVs was successfully introduced on the surface of BiOI samples. The SPV test is used to investigate the transfer behavior of photogenerated carriers with high sensitivity to defect states in the sample at its surface, bulk, or any buried interface [46]. Positive and negative SPV signals mean that photogenerated holes and electrons move to the surface of the sample, respectively [47]. As shown in Fig. 5B, the photovoltage of K-BiOI is positive in the range of 510–660 nm, which means that the OVs on the K-BiOI surface will capture photogenerated electrons and a small number of photogenerated holes will migrate to the K-BiOI surface to generate a positive signal in the range of 510–660 nm. This further suggested that the OVs was successfully introduced on the surface of K-BiOI samples. And the SPV response intensity of K-BiOI is stronger remarkably than O-BiOI in the range of 300–490 nm, indicating that the OVs on the K-BiOI surface are beneficial to the separation of photogenerated carriers [48]. Consequently, the high separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers would result in the improvement of photocatalytic activity of K-BiOI. As the generation of OVs was quantitatively accompanied with the appearance of Bi(3−x)+, the OV concentration of BiOI sample can be estimated via measuring the Bi(3−x)+ concentrations by XPS analysis [49,50]. The Bi(3−x)+ concentration (OV concentration) on the surface of K-BiOI (under UV–Vis-light irradiation for 5 h) was calculated to be about 12.3% (Fig. S2). As the light irradiation time or light intensity changes, the concentration will change. The optical property and energy band characteristics of O-BiOI and K-BiOI samples were also characterized by UV–Vis DRS and Mott-Schottky plot (impedance spectra) [36,51]. As shown in Fig. 5C, both the O-BiOI and K-BiOI samples had strong absorption in the wavelength range from 200 to 660 nm, while the K-BiOI sample also exhibited absorption in the fully visible spectrum. This may be due to the darker color of the K-BiOI sample. Additionally, the optical band gap could be calculated by the following formula (2) [52]: (2) α h ν = A ( h ν - E g ) n / 2 where α, h, A, ν and Eg represent the absorption coefficient, Planck’s constant, constant, light frequency and band gap energy, respectively. And their band gaps could be estimated from the intercept of tangents to the plots (Fig. S3), which were 1.89 and 1.92 eV, respectively. Theoretical prediction of CB and VB for BiOI were calculated by Eqs. (3) and (4) as follows [33]: (3) E VB = X - E e + 0.5 E g (4) E CB = E VB - E g where X is the Mulliken electronegativity, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5 V), Eg is the bandgap, ECB and EVB are the CB and VB edge potentials, respectively. The X value of BiOI is 5.94 eV. From the above empirical formulas, the EVB (VBM) and ECB (CBM) of O-BiOI and K-BiOI were (2.39 V and 0.50 V) and (2.40 V and 0.48 V), respectively. However, these equations are empirical, theoretical, and only take electronegativity into account. To further elucidate EVB and ECB of K-BiOI, the Mott-Schottky plot was drawn. The M−S plot for K-BiOI displayed n-type behavior due to the positive slope (Fig. 5D), yields a flat-band value of −0.99 V vs. Ag/AgCl corresponding to CB edge potential [36]. Meanwhile, the M−S plot for O-BiOI displayed p-type behavior due to the negative slope (Fig. S4), yields a flat-band value of 1.57 V vs. Ag/AgCl corresponding to VB edge potential. Thus, the CB edge potentials of O-BiOI and K-BiOI were approximated to lie at about 0.26 and −0.41 V vs. RHE, indicating that the CBM potential of K-BiOI was higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (0 V at pH = 0) and K-BiOI has the ability to produce hydrogen through light-driven water splitting. And the VBM and CBM potentials of K-BiOI are 1.51 V (−5.95 eV) and −0.41 V (−4.03 eV), which are close to the calculated value of the literature [37,53]. A strong FT-IR peak around 489 cm−1 was observed (Fig. S5), which was related to the vibration of Bi-O bond for BiOI [54]. This peak indicated that the entire composition of the O-BiOI and K-BiOI did not change and it was consistent with XRD data. The pore structure of mesoporous BiOI was investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis. Fig. 5E and F show the N2 sorption isotherms and the pore size distribution plots of O-BiOI and K-BiOI samples, respectively. According to the Brunauer, Deming, Deming and Teller classification, they could be classified as a type IV isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesoporous structure [55]. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of O-BiOI and K-BiOI samples were calculated by BET method to be 32.6 and 26.5 m2 g−1, respectively [33]. Meanwhile, the pore sizes of these samples were calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, which were in the 6–40 nm mesoporous range (Table 2 ). And the presence of mesopores favors multilight scattering/reflection, resulting in enhanced harvesting of the exciting light and thus improved photocatalytic activity [55]. Moreover, the K-BiOI sample had the smallest pore size (6.0 nm) and its pore sizes were more extensive than O-BiOI. It is worth noting that there is a hierarchical porosity composed of smaller mesopores (6.0 nm) connected with larger mesopores (35.0 nm) on surface of K-BiOI (Table 2), which facilitates fast mass transport and further improves the efficiency of hydrogen production [56]. The chemical structure of BiOI can help us understand the possible formation process of OVs onto BiOI surface. Referring to some literatures [57,58] and our experimental phenomena, we proposed the possible formation process of OVs in BiOI under UV–Vis irradiation. Firstly, the O atom located on the center of two Bi atoms and two I atoms is activated and disperses outward in the minimum one of potential energy surfaces under UV–Vis light irradiation (Fig. 6 C). Meanwhile, the local hopping of O atoms induces a local band bending under UV–Vis light irradiation, and then attracts the OVs formation contributing to a new energy level in the forbidden band. In addition, the EDS images shown in Fig. 3D, it was obvious that the density of O atoms is significantly lower than that of Bi atoms. Meanwhile, the layered crystal structure of BiOI nanoflakes is made up of [Bi2O2]2+ slabs interleaved by double slabs of I− (Fig. 6A and B) [31]. In other words, the atomic ratio of O to Bi should be 1:1 in BiOI. Thus, after a few hours of UV–Vis-light irradiation under vacuum condition, O-BiOI would lose some oxygen ions to form OVs on the surface (Fig. 6C). Based on the above results and discussion, the K-BiOI with abundant OVs was successfully obtained under UV–Vis-light irradiation in the vacuum condition, while the color change caused absorption range of K-BiOI to greatly expand in the fully visible spectrum."
8,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity To shed light on the correlation between OVs and photocatalytic activity of BiOI sample, we carried out hydrogen evolution experiment from water splitting to assess the photocatalytic activity of BiOI sample. At first, we carried out the hydrogen evolution experiment under pure water (without sacrificial agent). It is interesting that the color of O-BiOI changed from orange to kermesinus after 5 h treated under UV–Vis-light irradiation. The H2 production rate was almost 0.11 mmol g−1 h−1 after 5 h irradiation by UV–Vis light (Fig. S6), which suggested that the K-BiOI with OVs could be used as a photocatalyst to produce hydrogen through light-driven water splitting. In order to study the photocatalytic properties fully, we used methanol as a sacrificial agent. Fig. 7 A shows photocatalytic H2 evolution curves of O-BiOI under different light irradiation. The H2 production rates were almost zero or 0.31 mmol g−1 h−1 after 5 h irradiation by visible light or UV light, respectively. And the H2 production rate was remarkably improved (6.51 mmol g−1 h−1) after 5 h irradiation by UV–Vis light, which was 21-fold than that under UV light irradiation. According to the above discussion, the color change indicates that OVs have been introduced on the surface of K-BiOI, which has a crucial effect on H2 production. Recently, a lot of efforts have been devoted to synthesizing different kinds of photocatalysts with OVs for hydrogen generation through light-driven water splitting [59]. The most single catalysts without cocatalysts loading have relatively low hydrogen production rates (Table 3 ). The K-BiOI without noble metal as cocatalyst prepared in this work has higher hydrogen production rate than most single catalyst materials. Thus, the photocatalyst K-BiOI could be a promising candidate for hydrogen generation through light-driven water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, the number of photons would increase as the light intensity increases, leading to an increase in the H2 production rate per unit time. Thus, when we changed the lamp current from 16 A to 19 A, the H2 production rate became higher to 10.78 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. S7). It was obvious that the H2 production rate of single hour increased rapidly from 5.48 to 10.82 mmol g−1 h−1 when we increased the lamp current from 16 A to 19 A at the beginning of the fourth hour (Fig. S7). Therefore, UV–Vis-light irradiation and the light intensity had significant impacts on the H2 production rate and introduction OVs onto BiOI surface. In order to further investigate the H2 production repeatability of K-BiOI, the repeated photocatalytic tests were carried out. After each cycle, we placed K-BiOI turbid liquid at room temperature overnight and most of K-BiOI naturally returned to O-BiOI under oxygen-rich environment. Before another cycle, a certain amount of sacrificial agent was added. As shown in Fig. 7B, 5 cycles of the photocatalytic H2 production test was performed with the as-prepared photocatalyst. Moreover, the reaction rate was significantly increased in the last three cycles, which should be attributed to the change of solution acidity and increase of OVs on the catalyst surface. Fig. 8 shows photographs and pH values of the solution before and after five cycles, and we found that the color of the solutions turned gray after each reaction, which should be caused by the introduction of OVs on the catalyst surface. Additionally, under the conditions of oxygen enrichment at room temperature, the gray of the solution will turn into light orange. This should be attributed to the fact that 001-Bi is unstable in oxygen-rich environment and may recombine with oxygen because Bi-O bond has high bonding energy (343 kJ mol−1) [68,69]. The color of the solution would deepen after each cycle (Fig. 8), indicating the increase of OVs on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, after the reaction, the pH values of the solutions were getting smaller and smaller and close to 4.4, which were consistent with the theoretical value [37]. Therefore, OVs on the catalyst surface and solution acidity played crucial roles on the H2 production rate. Fig. S9 shows the photographs of the solution after the reaction, which were placed under vacuum for 0 h, 2 h and 7 h in one experiment. It was clear that the colors of the solution didn’t change significantly, which further indicated that the Bi-O bonds on BiOI surface would only recover under oxygen-rich environment. To verify that the OVs onto the surface of BiOI can be used as active sites, we added 1 mL of 30% H2O2 in reaction system before reaction [49]. Fig. S10 shows photocatalytic H2 evolution curves of BiOI without and with H2O2. It was obvious that the hydrogen production rate was significantly reduced after H2O2 added, which indicated that the OVs could be act as active sites for hydrogen generation through light-driven water splitting."
9,Photoelectric response,"3.3 Photoelectric response The photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst is closely related to the charge carrier density and recombination rate and movement of photogenerated carrier on the photocatalyst surface [12]. To systematically study the recombination rate of photogenerated carrier, the photoelectrochemical and PL emission spectra tests were performed, including transient photocurrent response (TPR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and PL emission spectra. The TPR curves under UV–Vis- or Vis-light irradiation were shown in Fig. 9 . The photocurrent under UV–Vis-light irradiation was 3.3 times as high as that under Vis-light irradiation. It demonstrated that more photoexcited electrons were produced under UV–Vis-light irradiation. The rapid separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers on the surface of the working electrode leads to the generation of photocurrent under light irradiation condition [70,71]. Consequently, the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers was significantly improved under UV–Vis-light irradiation, resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Fig. S11A showed the EIS curves, and the electrochemical impedances were basically the same under UV–Vis- or Vis-light irradiation. In order to confirm the great influence of the introduction of OVs on the catalyst surface on photocatalytic performance, PL spectrum test was carried out, which was a kind of important technique to reveal the photophysical processes of semiconductors, such as photogenerated carrier separation and charge transfer [72]. From PL emission spectra (Fig. S11B), the intensity of K-BiOI was lower than that of O-BiOI, indicating a lower recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers on the K-BiOI surface. According to the above discussion and some literature [37,58,73], a possible photogenerated carrier excitation-recombination process of K-BiOI with OVs has been proposed. As shown in Fig. 10 , the value of the CBM energy of (K-BiOI) is about −4.03 eV, which is higher than the reduction potential (about −4.44 eV) of H+/H2. OVs can form a defect state lying near the CBM of the photocatalyst. Upon UV–Vis-light irradiation, electrons in VB of K-BiOI moved to the CB, forming photogenerated electron hole pairs (step 1). Then, the photogenerated electrons on CB of K-BiOI preferably transfer to OVs state (step 2) rather than directly recombining with the photogenerated holes (step 3). This can be attributed to OVs as a capture center to capture photogenerated electrons during the process of photoreactions [58]. Thus, the direct recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively inhibited. Finally, the photogenerated electrons on OVs state and holes recombine in the VB (step 4). Moreover, Sugawara et al. found the lifetime of electrons on defect states were several times longer than that of the free electrons [74]. Therefore, the OVs on K-BiOI surface reduced the recombination rate of photogenerated carrier, resulting in a high photoactivity."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, we have successfully introduced abundant OVs onto mesoporous BiOI surface by UV–Vis-Light driving method firstly. During the reaction, the color of the BiOI changed from orange to kermesinus, which should be attributed to introduction OVs on surface of K-BiOI. The K-BiOI sample without noble metal (Pt, Pd or Au as cocatalyst) loading exhibited a high H2 production rate of 6.51 mmol g−1 h−1. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the amount of OVs on the catalyst surface had crucial impact on the H2 production rate. The high separation and transfer efficiency and lower recombination rate of photogenerated carriers led to the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production performance. By adding H2O2 to the reaction system, it was proved that OVs could be used as the active sites for hydrogen generation through light-driven water splitting. Moreover, we proposed the possible formation mechanism of OVs and photogenerated carrier excitation-recombination process on K-BiOI surface with OVs. In this work, we provided a new route for introduction OVs on the catalyst surface, and the photocatalyst K-BiOI could be a promising candidate for hydrogen generation through light-driven water splitting."
