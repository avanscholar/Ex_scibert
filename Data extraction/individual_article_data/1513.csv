0,Introduction,"Fuel cells, the energy converting devices with a high efficiency and low/zero emission, are attracting increasing attention in recent decades due to high energy demands, fossil fuel depletion, and environmental pollution. Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) and direct alcohol (methanol/ethanol) fuel cells (DAFC) have been attracting enormous research interest as power sources for vehicles and portable electronic devices [1–4]. However, to become commercially viable, fuel cells have to overcome one of the barriers of high catalyst cost caused by the exclusive use of platinum and platinum-based electrocatalysts [5,6] in both oxidation of the fuel and reduction of the oxygen at the fuel-cell electrodes. Apart from the issue of the high cost of catalyst and other fuel-cell system components (polymer electrolyte membrane, bipolar plates, power system), fuel cells suffer from insufficient performance durability arising mainly from cathode catalyst agglomeration, oxidation, catalyst migration, loss of electrode active surface area, corrosion of the carbon support etc,. In the case of DMFC, in addition to all the above issues, Pt at the cathode also endures a performance loss resulting from the mixed potential due to methanol diffusion through the membrane from the anode side of the cell [7,8]. Further, in fuel cells, the hydrogen produced via steam or partial oxidation reforming of hydrocarbons or renewable fuels typically contains 0.5–2.0vol% CO. However, Pt electrodes in PEMFC are extremely sensitive to even low levels of CO (50ppm) [9–11]. Hence search for efficient, durable and, most importantly, inexpensive catalysts as alternatives to Pt and Pt-based materials, and a support material is always on the limelight [12,13]. Recently, cobalt was confirmed as an effective promoter for improving the catalytic activity of mixed oxides catalysts [14]. Additionally, cobalt-based catalysts showed a very high activity promoting CO oxidation at low temperature [15–17]. On the other hand pyrolized cobalt and iron porphyrins, are proved to be the potential candidates of oxygen reduction reaction due to presence of metal–nitrogen bond [18–21]. Durability and cyclic stability have become main drawbacks of metal porphyrins under practical fuel-cell operating conditions. Due to their high electronic conductivity and ability to generating active ORR sites of metal–nitrogen bond with metal particles, conducting polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene can be considered as another option towards the development of non-precious electrocatalysts. Furthermore, catalytic performance depends on the nature of the support, active site, and preparation techniques. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are attractive materials for catalyst support in fuel cells due to their morphology and interesting properties such as nanometer size, high accessible surface area, corrosion resistance, good electronic conductivity and high stability [22,23]. Although ideally the Pt catalyst should be replaced at both fuel-cell electrodes, the substitution of the cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a non-precious material is likely to result in significantly greater reduction of the Pt needed for fuel cells [24]. There are different methods for dispersing platinum/platinum alloys on CNTs and since CNTs are chemically inert, activating their surfaces is essential and this has motivated numerous studies to improve metal dispersions on CNTs, mainly through optimization of the metal supporting procedures or functionalisation of the CNT surface [25–27]. The various chemical and electrochemical depositions of platinum group metals with its applications in fuel cell technologies have been reviewed [28]. Pt nanoparticles have been electrodeposited on MWCNTs by potentiostatic method and its electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction has been studied [29,30]. In the present work, we demonstrate the fuel cell performance with novel MWCNT supported PPY-Co electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction along with Pt–Ru/MWCNT electrocatalyst for oxidation of hydrogen and methanol at the anode and Pt–Sn/MWCNT electrocatalyst for oxidation of ethanol at the anode in PEMFC, direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC), respectively (Fig. 13 ). For the dispersion of metal particles over MWCNT we have used simple chemical reduction method by taking their respective salts and pre-functionalized MWCNT. The present work highlights the dispersion of Co-PPy and 3–5nm nanocrystalline Pt–Ru and Pt–Sn electrocatalysts on the MWCNT support. The systematic study of performance of three different types of fuel cells with low loadings of nanocrystalline Pt–Ru and Pt–Sn electrocatalysts at the anode (0.25mg cm−2 for H2–O2, 2.5mgcm−2 for CH3OH–O2 and C2H5OH–O2) and with Pt-free Co-PPY-MWCNT (Co loading: 0.5 and 2.5mg/cm2, respectively for PEMFC and DAFC) at the cathode with the fuel injection accomplished at atmospheric pressure highlights the advantages of using the emerging nanotechnology to the fuel cell technology with CNT supported nanocrystalline electrocatalysts."
1,Materials and experimental details,
2,Synthesis of MWCNT,"2.1 Synthesis of MWCNT MWCNT have been synthesized by catalytic chemical vapour deposition of acetylene over Mm based AB3 alloy hydride catalyst using single furnace technique. The Mischmetal (Bharat Rare Earths Metals, India) used has the following composition:-Ce 50%, La 35%, Pr 8%, Nd 5%, Fe 0.5% and other rare earth elements 1.5%. Alloy hydride catalyst has been obtained by hydrogen decrepitation technique using high pressure hydrogen absorption/desorption facility. About 250mg of the hydride powder was placed in a quartz boat and then introduced to the flow reactor (quartz tube with an inner diameter of 30mm and a length of 100mm), for the synthesis of MWCNT. The alloy hydride powders were heated at 500°C in hydrogen flow (50ml/min) for 1h in order to reduce any surface oxidized catalyst particles. The hydrogen gas flow was stopped and temperature of the furnace was raised to 700°C, for the production of MWCNT. Acetylene was then allowed to flow (50ml/min) for 30min. The deposition was carried out at atmospheric pressure and in an argon flow. The purification of the as-grown sample was carried out by air oxidation at 500°C for 2h to remove the amorphous carbon and to open the ends of carbon nanotubes. The above air oxidized CNTs were then refluxed with conc HNO3 for 24h, followed by washing with de-ionized water several times and then the sample was dried in air for 30min at 100°C."
3,Functionalization of MWCNT,"2.2 Functionalization of MWCNT Purified MWCNT were ultrasonicated in aqua regia solution for 3h. After the sonication procedure, MWCNT sample were washed with de-ionized water several times and dried in air for 30min at 100°C. These functionalized MWCNT are divided into three parts, one is used for PPY-Co/MWCNT cathode electrocatalyst and others for Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT anode electrocatalysts."
4,Preparation of PPY-Co/MWCNT for cathode,"2.3 Preparation of PPY-Co/MWCNT for cathode PPY/MWCNT composites were first prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization of a monomer (pyrrole) on the surface of MWCNT. The electrochemical method is limited in terms of mass production of the materials and also it is not suitable for preparing composites with a large proportion of polymer. Composites were prepared by immersion of the MWCNT (0.1g) into an aqueous solution of monomer and addition of an oxidant to this solution. PPY was deposited on MWCNT by chemical polymerization of 0.5ml pyrrole with 1.2g of FeCl3 in 50ml of 0.1molL−1 HCl. The nanocomposites materials were then filtered and washed with a large amount of water and subsequently with ethanol to remove the residual oxidant. Finally, all composites were washed with acetone and dried at 60°C. The content of MWCNT in the composites was determined gravimetrically. The polypyrrole-MWCNT composite (4.5g) was mixed with 100mL de-ionized water in a round-bottom flask and refluxed for 30min, after which a solution of Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O (2.47g in 25mL of distilled water) was added. The obtained mixture was vigorously stirred for 30min at 75–80°C, followed by continuous addition of 500mL 0.2M NaBH4/0.2M NaOH solution (at 80°C) at the rate of 20mL per minute using a peristaltic pump until pH reached 11.1 and then remained constant for 30min, thus indicating completion of the reduction process. The catalyst was filtered, washed with warm de-ionized water until the filtrate pH reached 7.0, and finally dried overnight at 90°C under vacuum. The cobalt yield after the synthesis was calculated to be about 10%."
5,Preparation of Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT for anode,"2.4 Preparation of Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT for anode The above prepared carboxyl group functionalized MWCNT were sonicated in acetone in order to remove any agglomeration of the CNTs that might result during the washing and filtering. The solid phase was removed by centrifugation and washed with distilled water; the recovered MWCNT were dried at 80°C for 12h. The dried sample was ultrasonicated in 10ml of acetone for 1h and then 0.075M H2PtCl6 and 0.15M RuCl2 solutions were added slowly during stirring. After 12h, the mixture was reduced by adding reducing solution containing 0.1M NaBH4 and 1M NaOH. After completion of reaction, the solution was washed with de-ionized water, filtered and dried by vacuum filtration. The recovered Pt–Ru loaded MWCNT were dried at 80°C for 3h. A similar procedure was followed for the preparation of Pt–Sn/MWCNT by using 0.15M SnCl2 solution instead of RuCl2. The crystallinity of the samples was obtained by X- ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis using SHIMADZU XD-D1 X-ray diffractometer. The diffraction patterns were recorded at room temperature with a Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5405Å) at a scan rate of 0.05degree/min. Morphological characteristics of CNTs were obtained using a JEOL JSM 840A scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating at 20kV. The samples were coated with gold using a sputter coating unit, to avoid charging during the recording. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out using JEM 200 FX II and PHILIPS CM 200 (200kV), transmission electron microscopes. The sample was initially dispersed in acetone by ultrasonicating for 1h. It was then allowed to settle and a drop of the supernatant liquid was transferred on to a carbon coated copper grid and mounted onto the microscope and the micrographs were recorded. Raman spectrometric measurements were performed in a Renishaw Raman spectrometer excited by a 514.5nm Ar-ion laser and using FT-Raman spectrometer (FRA 106 Bruker) excited by a 1064nm laser."
6,Preparation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA),"2.5 Preparation of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) Required amount of anode (20mg of Pt–Ru/MWCNT for PEMFC and 200mg of Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT for DMFC and DEFC, respectively) and cathode (80, 400 and 400mg of Co-PPY/MWCNT for PEMFC, DMFC and DEFC, respectively) catalysts were suspended in de-ionized water and ultrasonicated by adding 5% (wt/wt) Nafion solution separately. The catalyst was combined with de-ionized water to achieve a 1:10 ratio by weight. Nafion® suspension was added in an amount sufficient to reach a 1:1 volumetric ratio between the ionically-conducting phase (Nafion®) and the electronically-conducting phase (catalyst+carbon) in dry catalyst. The mixture was placed in an ice bath to prevent overheating and minimize evaporation of solvents, and then ultrasonically mixed for 150s. Nafion membrane (Nafion 1135 and Nafion 1110) cut in the dimension of 5×5cm2 was pretreated by boiling in a solution of 5% H2O2 and 1M H2SO4 at 80°C for 30min and washing with deionized water, and placed on a vacuum table preheated to 80°C. The vacuum table was used to hold the membrane in place and avoid wrinkling during the catalyst application. Either the anode ink or cathode ink (prepared by dispersing the catalyst in de-ionized water and 5wt% nafion solution) was then applied to one side of the membrane using a camel hair brush. After the painting of the first electrode had been completed, the membrane was turned over and the other electrode was painted on the other side. The vials containing the anode and cathode inks were cooled in an ice bath during painting and capped to minimize evaporation of solvents. Upon completion of painting, the MEA was left on the heated vacuum table for an additional 30min. to allow the anode and cathode catalyst layers to cure. The single cell was assembled using the gas diffusion layered carbon paper (Toray), MEA, two graphite plates with gas channels machined to a serpentine geometry, two Teflon gaskets and two aluminum end plates. The performance of the fuel cells was studied by an indigenously fabricated Fuel Cell test station, using a dc electronic load box. Since hydration of the electrolyte membrane is important for attaining good performance of the fuel cell, reactant gases were humidified at 60, 70 and 80°C when the MEA were at 70, 80 and 90°C, respectively. The performance of PEMFC was carried out under an operating pressure of 1bar of oxygen and hydrogen. 1M methanol and 1M ethanol were passed at a rate of 1mlmin−1 for DMFC and DEFC, respectively by maintaining oxygen operating pressure of 1bar."
7,Results and discussion,"Mm based AB3 alloy, after several hydrogenation and dehydrogenation cycles, were found to be finely powdered to about 5–10μm. These novel hydride catalysts prepared using hydrogen decrepitation technique provides fresh surfaces with large surface area, free from oxidation which further increases the catalytic sites for the formation of CNTs. High hydrogen absorption, large decrepitation and low cost makes these hydrides better catalysts for large scale production of CNTs. Fig. 1 a shows the XRD pattern of as-prepared CNTs using alloy hydrides as catalysts. The peaks are indexed to the reflections of hexagonal graphite. A few peaks corresponding to the catalytic impurities are also seen. The impurity peaks in the as-grown MWCNT corresponds to MmH2 and Ni, which are due to the catalyst MmNi3-H. The XRD of purified MWCNT (Fig. 1b) clearly shows the removal of metallic impurities (MmH2 and Ni) by acid treatment. XRD pattern of Pt–Ru/MWCNT shows only the reflection characteristics corresponding to Pt along with the reflections of hexagonal graphite Fig. 1c, with some shift in the position of 2θ which may be due to incorporation of ruthenium atoms on platinum lattice [31]. Whereas, Fig. 1d shows the reflection peaks corresponding to both Pt and Sn along with the hexagonal peak of graphite. The presence of metallic platinum is clearly revealed by the characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt [111], [200], [220] and [311], which represents the typical character of a crystalline Pt face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. Where as the presence of Sn is reviled by the characteristic diffraction peaks of Sn [211] and [301], which represents the typical character of crystalline Sn body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. Fig. 2 a–c show the SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of purified MWCNT, respectively. From these figures it is clear that good quality MWCNT have been obtained by CCVD technique using Mm based AB3 alloy hydride catalyst. Further, HRTEM image reveals the multi-walled nature of carbon nanotubes with each graphene layer being clearly distinguishable since the graphene sheets with a spacing is ∼0.34nm are stacked parallel to the growth axis of carbon nanotubes. Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the vibrational properties of the carbon samples. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of purified MWCNT. Tangential modes corresponding to the Raman allowed optical mode E2g of two-dimensional graphite, centered at 1578.4cm−1 (G-band) is observed. In addition, a peak centered at 1353.8cm−1 (D-band) is mainly due to defects and carbonaceous particles present in the sample. The intensity of D-band gives degree of disorder present along the tube. These can be pentagons, heptagonal defects, the pentagon–heptagon pairs or line defects [32]. This peak still remains with low intensity implying that some degree of disorder is present along the tube even after purification. The high value of D/G ratio can be attributed due to the defects created along the nanotube surface during the purification of nanotubes by vigorous acid treatment. Fig. 4 shows the SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of PPY-Co dispersed MWCNT ORR catalysts. Uniform dispersion of PPY over MWCNT has been achieved by in-suite polymerization technique by oxidizing monomer and nano particles of Co could be dispersed on PPY-MWCNT composite. Uniform dispersion of polypyrrole (PPY) on MWCNT and nano-particles of Cobalt over PPY-MWCNT composites have been achieved for the first time. Figs. 5 and 6 show the SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT, respectively. The TEM images of Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT indicate a uniform distribution of catalyst particles of size of about 3–5nm on the MWCNT. The lattice planes shown in HRTEM image of Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT reveal the crystalline nature of catalytic particles Pt–Ru and Pt–Sn, which is also a prerequisite for enhanced catalytic activity. The purity of MWCNT is found to be of 95% (Fig. 7 ) from thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). From the TGA analysis of Co-PPY/MWCNT, Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT the amount of catalyst has been quantified to be for 10, 20 and 22, respectively (Fig. 7). Figs. 8–10 show the polarization curves of PEMFC, DMFC and DEFC, respectively at 70, 80 and 90°C. After activation cycles, PEMFC generates 0.15Acm−2 at 0.5V and peak power density of 140mWcm−2 with catalyst loadings of 0.25mgcm−2 of Pt–Ru and 0.5mgcm−2 of Co on the anode and cathode, respectively. Our previous studies have shown that Pt based PEMFC generates 140mWcm−2 with Pt/C anode and Pt/C cathode, 230mWcm−2 for Pt/C anode and Pt/MWCNT cathode and 225mWcm−2 for Pt/C anode and Pt/SWCNT cathode [33,34]. All these results are obtained at ambient pressure and for a platinum loading of 0.25mgcm−2 for anode and 0.5mgcm−2 for cathode. Another important parameter is for the PPY-Co dispersed MWCNT ORR catalyst based PEMFC is the excellent stability for 50h not only at high current density but also at high voltage (0.7V; Fig. 11 ). The performance study at 90°C shows that PPY-Co dispersed MWCNT ORR catalyst based PEMFC shows durability of PPY-Co-MWCNT catalyst for oxygen reduction activity. We have further tested the suitability of PPY-Co dispersed MWCNT ORR catalyst to alcohol based fuel cells with appropriate anode electrodes. DMFC with Pt–Ru/MWCNT (1.5mg Pt/cm2) at the anode and Co-PPY/MWCNT (2.5mg Co/cm2) at the cathode results in a peak power density of 57mWcm−2 at an operating temperature of 90°C with an oxygen pressure at 1atm, which is better than 32mWcm−2 at 70°C, reported in Ref. [35] for a Pt/C with 2mg Pt/cm2 at the cathode and Pt–Ru loading of 2.1mgcm−2 at the anode. The better performance is attributed mainly due to the high oxygen reduction activity of non precious Co-PPY-MWCNT at the cathode electrode than Pt/C. Pt–Sn/C is proved to be a best candidate for oxidation of ethanol [36] among other electro catalysts like Pt–Ru/C, PtW/C, PtPd/C and Pt/C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to use MWCNT supported electrocatalyst (Pt–Sn) for DEFC at the anode electrode and non precious metal Co-PPY-MWCNT at the cathode electrode. The performance values of DEFC are quite encouraging even with less loadings of Pt–Sn at the anode apart from complete elimination of precious metals at the cathode. DEFC could generate a peak power density of 33mWcm−2 at 90°C. Although the power density is less than 55.8mWcm−2 recently reported with Pt–Sn/C catalyst, the present result was obtained at a significantly lower absolute pressure of oxygen (1atm versus the 2.0atm used in Ref. [37]) with non precious Co-PPY-MWCNT at the cathode electrode than Pt/C. Further a comparison of fuel cell performance has been carried out by making MEA containing Co-MWCNT without PPY and the obtained results have been given in Fig. 12 . The Co-MWCNT catalyst shows a peak performance of 60mW/cm2 which is approximately half of the performance shown by the Co-PPY/MWCNT catalyst (Fig. 8). Thus the increase in the performance of PEMFC is attributed to the uniform distribution of PPY over the MWCNT which improves the MWCNT-Co interaction and stability. In order to compare the improvement of performance of fuel cell due to MWCNT support over commercially available carbon supported electrocatalyst, three different MEAs have been made using Pt–Ru/C and Pt–Sn/C as anode materials for PEMFC, DMFC and DEFC. The polarization curves obtained for all the fuel cells at 90°C are given in Fig. 12. The peak performance of PEMFC, DMFC and DEFC using commercially available carbon supported electrocatalyst, respectively are 90, 39 and 23mW/cm2, where as MWCNT supported electrocatalyst shows a peak performance of 140, 57 and 33mW/cm2, respectively for PEMFC, DMFC and DEFC. Thus the increase in the performance of fuel cell is attributed to the high conductivity of MWCNT over the carbon and uniform dispersion of catalytic particles over the large surface of MWCNT."
8,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated PEMFC, DMFC and DEFC with a novel MWCNT supported Co-PPY composites as electrode material for oxygen reduction reaction and Pt–Ru/MWCNT and Pt–Sn/MWCNT as an anode electrocatalysts with MWCNT as potential candidate as support material. This MWCNT supported Co-PPY electrocatalysts promise to deliver high ORR activity without any noticeable loss in performance over long PEMFC operating times."
