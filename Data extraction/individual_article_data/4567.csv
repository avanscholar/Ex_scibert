0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil diesel fuels, global warming concerns and the stricter limits on regulated pollutant emissions encourage the use of renewable fuels. Biodiesel is the most used renewable fuel in compression ignition (CI) engines. The majority of the literature agrees that particulate matter (PM), unburnt total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from biodiesel are lower than from conventional diesel fuel [1–3]. One of the most important reasons for this is the oxygen content of biodiesel [4,5], this induces a more complete and cleaner combustion process. When compared to standard diesel, the use of biodiesel can lead to more effective THC, CO and particulate matter oxidation [6] and increased NOx emissions [7–9], depending on the engine technology employed, combustion characteristics and other physical and chemical properties of the biodiesel. The absence of aromatic compounds in biodiesel are another factor which justifies the particulate matter reduction with respect to diesel [3,10]. Due to the emission benefits derived from the oxygen in the fuel molecule, the interest in the use of bio-alcohols fuel blends in compression ignition engines has been increased [11–13]. One such fuel is biobutanol which has some favourable properties like having a higher energy density, being less prone to water contamination, less corrosive, having a better blending stability and higher cetane number with respect to ethanol. Biobutanol is a biomass-based renewable fuel which can be produced using alcoholic fermentation of biomass feedstock. To this end, the production sustainability depends on the feedstock and the production process. However, both the feedstock (i.e. maize, sugar cane, sugar beets) and production process used to produce ethanol can easily be adapted to produce butanol. The sustainablity of the production process can be further improved by the use of lignocellulosic material through fermentation to produce butanol. Unfortunately, this technology is in its infancy more research is needed to develop it. Furthermore, butanol can be produced by anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol which is the main co-product of the tranesterification reaction in biodiesel production [14]. This route seems to be a viable option to dispose of crude glycerol. There have been several recent investigations into the use of biobutanol blended with diesel fuel in CI engines [13,15]. Although longer-chain alcohols are more suitable for blending with diesel, properties like lubricity, viscosity and cetane number of butanol–diesel blends still need to be improved [16]. One approach to this is the addition of biodiesel which can improve all of these properties [17] forming diesel–biodiesel–butanol ternary blends. However, in this work a totally renewable binary liquid fuel blend composed of biodiesel and butanol is studied in order to reduce NOx emissions with respect to pure biodiesel (derived from the heat of vaporisation of butanol) [13,14], while maintaining similar particulate matter emissions benefits (from the oxygen content of the butanol) [17]. However, the high heat of vaporisation of butanol could also increase CO and THC emissions with respect to pure biodiesel [18].To counteract any increase in gaseous and carbonaceous emissions, the addition of hydrogen to replace part of the carbon within the liquid fuel was also studied and is presented here. The environmental benefit of hydrogen especially in terms of green house gas emissions mainly depends on the feedstock and the production process of hydrogen. A number of studies have reported the engine-out emission benefits of the partial replacement of diesel by gaseous hydrogen in dual fuel engine systems [19–21]. However, the use of hydrogen with oxygenated fuels has not been extensively studied, particularly in the case of butanol blends. The aim of this paper is to present the potential benefit of using renewable fuel blends, in this case butanol and RME, in terms of combustion characteristics and engine out emissions. In addition to this, the synergies of using hydrogen and oxygenated fuels as a means of providing further improvements to combustion and reductions in carbonaceous emissions was also studied. Finally, the application of EGR with oxygenated fuel blends was also investigated as a means of reducing NOx emissions."
1,Experimental setup and materials,"The experimental apparatus was set up as detailed in Fig. 1 . The engine was a single cylinder, naturally aspirated research engine and employed a pump-line-nozzle direct injection system as described in Table 1 . An eddy current dynamometer with motor and a load cell was used to load the engine. In-cylinder pressure traces were recorded by a Kistler 6125B pressure transducer mounted at the cylinder head and connected via a Kistler 5011 charge amplifier to a data acquisition board (National Instruments PCI-MIO-16E-4). The crankshaft position was measured using a digital shaft encoder. Other standard engine test rig instrumentation was used to monitor intake air, exhaust gas recirculation, temperatures (oil, air, inlet manifold and exhaust) and pressures. Data acquisition and combustion analysis were carried out using a bespoke LabVIEW based code. A Horiba Mexa 7100DEGR analyser was employed to measure the concentrations of gaseous emissions. A non-dispersive infrared, flame ionization detector and chemiluminescence technique were used to measure CO, THC and NOx respectively. To study size distribution of particulate matter emitted from the engine, a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), model TSI/3080, fitted with thermodiluter was used. Experiments were performed at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and variable engine loads of 3 and 5 bar IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure), representing 40% (low) and 70% (high) of maximum load respectively. The tests were carried out initially using diesel and biodiesel fuels as a benchmark. B8R (8% butanol blended with 92% biodiesel fuel by volume) and B16R blends were prepared and tested under the same conditions for comparison. Hydrogen, when added was introduced and mixed with the air before the intake manifold valve. The effect of hydrogen concentration (0.5, 1, 2 and 3% of volumetric air flow rate) was investigated with the aim of determining the optimal hydrogen concentration. Three different conditions of cooled EGR rate (0%, 10% and 20%) were analysed to overcome the NOx penalty. The basic properties of tested fuels are given in Table 2 ."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Combustion studies and engine performance,"3.1 Combustion studies and engine performance The use of RME resulted in an increased rate of the fuel burnt in the premixed phase with the combustion advanced to an earlier crank angle position, leading to higher peak in-cylinder pressures compared to ULSD (Fig. 2 and Table 3 ). This is likely to be a consequence of the compressibility of biodiesel fuel which is lower than that of ULSD resulting in the advance of the start of injection [22]. The addition of butanol increased the rate of heat release in premixed combustion (Table 3) and resulted in a longer ignition delay due to the lower cetane number of the fuel and higher heat of vaporisation compared with ULSD and RME [23]. The addition of hydrogen led to an increase in the premixed combustion at both operating conditions (3 and 5 bar IMEP) (Fig. 3 ) due to the faster flame speed of hydrogen compared with the liquid fuels. This trend for hydrogen and its effect on RME can be also applied to the combustion characteristics of the other tested fuels (Table 3). The equivalence ratio (i.e. the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio over the actual air/fuel ratio) was similar for the different liquid fuels tested in this study at each operating condition (Fig. 4 a). This indicated that the difference between the fuels was the direct result of fuel composition. The combustion of the butanol fuel blends produced an increase in the indicated specific fuel consumption as a result of their lower heating value (Fig. 4b), while the indicated thermal efficiency was similar with both biodiesel and diesel. The addition of hydrogen reduced the engine thermal efficiency by a small amount. This was most likely to be a consequence of a decrease in volumetric efficiency as a result of the replacement of air with hydrogen into the engine. The energy substitution of the liquid fuel (not shown) by hydrogen at 3 bar IMEP is higher than at 5 bar IMEP, i.e. as the same amount of hydrogen was delivered and the total power at 5 bar is higher than at 3 bar. For instance, when 3% of hydrogen was used, it replaced 20% and 15% of liquid fuel at low and high load respectively."
4,Carbonaceous gas emissions,"3.2 Carbonaceous gas emissions The THC emissions are shown in Fig. 5 a. It can be seen that THC of RME was lower than diesel for both engine loads, due to the oxygen content of biodiesel which makes the combustion more complete [3]. Also, the advanced start of combustion with RME increased the available time for the oxidation of the hydrocarbon emissions. An increase in THC emissions was obtained when butanol was substituted for RME in the B8R and B16R blends. This increase was mainly due to the high heat of vaporisation of alcohol fuels, as is explained in other works [13,15]. It is suggested that the higher heat of vaporisation of butanol cooled the combustion chamber resulting in an incomplete combustion. This effect is more influential at low load conditions because the combustion temperature is lower than at high load. The addition of hydrogen to the tested fuels tended to decrease THC emissions due to the replacement of the liquid fuels in the combustion process. It is notable that incomplete combustion can occur due to the lack of oxygen leading to an increase in THC emissions when a high fraction of hydrogen is applied at high load [24]. CO emissions of RME are lower than diesel for both engine conditions (Fig. 5b) and this is again the result of complete combustion due to the oxygen content of the biodiesel. The addition of butanol resulted in a decrease in CO emissions, potentially a result of the lower C/H ratio of butanol compared to RME. This effect compensated for the increase in CO with alcohols blends due to the higher heat of vaporisation and as a consequence of reduced in-cylinder temperatures. Further reductions in CO were found when hydrogen was added to the fuel blends. The CO emissions decreased as the hydrogen content increased. As in the case of THC emissions, this decrease is mainly due to the reduction in liquid fuel."
5,NOx emissions,"3.3 NOx emissions The effect of hydrogen addition on NOx emissions for all the tested fuels at low and high load is shown in Fig. 6 . Comparing the liquid fuels, NO emissions (Fig. 6a) for RME and butanol blends are higher than in the case of diesel. The reason for this is the higher bulk modulus of RME which advances injection (especially in mechanical injection systems) and as a result the start of combustion is advanced. Additionally, the oxygen content of RME can also favour NO emissions as discussed above. The poor cetane number of butanol increased the ignition delay and the rate of premixed combustion favouring NO formation in the B8R and B16R blends. Conversely, the high heat of vaporisation of butanol cools the combustion chamber reducing NO emissions. In the case of B8R these two main effects compensate for each other resulting in similar NO emissions when butanol replaced RME. As NO2 emissions are similar for all the tested fuels (Fig. 6b), this resulted in similar level of total NOx for all the fuels. However, when a higher percentage of butanol was used (B16R), the effect of the heat of vaporisation tended to be more influential and as consequence NOx emissions were reduced. The addition of hydrogen significantly reduced NO emissions at low loads for all the tested fuels. As shown in [25], a small addition of hydrogen reduces the NOx due to its combustion characteristics. Also [26,27], showed that hydrogen addition into the engine increases the fraction of H2O which decreases the cylinder peak temperature and NOx emissions. However, at high load when more than 1% of hydrogen was inducted, NO emissions increased as a result of faster hydrogen combustion due to high diffusivity and the high flame speed [28]. These results are confirmed by the combustion traces shown in Fig. 3. At low load the addition of hydrogen did not increase the combustion pressure, while at high load the hydrogen addition clearly produced an increase in combustion pressure and as a consequence an increase in local combustion temperature favouring NOx emissions. In terms of NO2, it can be seen from Fig. 6b that the addition of hydrogen significantly increased NO2 emissions compared to the liquid fuel combustion. The main route in the production of NO2 is via the oxidation of NO with the hydroperxyl (HO2) radical. Therefore, the introduction of hydrogen increased the HO2 level, as shown experimentally by [29] and numerically by [30] which in turn resulted in the increase in NO2 emissions. At low loads the reduction in NO with hydrogen was balanced by the increase in NO2 resulting in similar NOx emissions. However, in the case of high engine load the increase in both NO and NO2 with hydrogen resulted in a larger increase in total NOx emissions, especially when more than 1% hydrogen was used."
6,Particle size distribution,"3.4 Particle size distribution Particle size distributions expressed in particle number concentration are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . The particle number concentrations for every particle diameter are significantly lower in the case of both the RME and butanol blends than for diesel at both engine loads (Fig. 7). The reduction in the number of particles was mainly a result of the oxygen content and absence of aromatics in RME and butanol. The presence of oxygen in fuel molecules reduces the number of rich regions in the combustion chamber diminishing particle precursors and particle formation. The higher oxygen content also enhanced particle and precursor oxidation. Comparing the renewable blends, when butanol replaced RME (B8R and B16R) further reductions in particle number concentrations were obtained. This is a result of the higher oxygen content when RME is replaced by butanol and also because of the higher effectiveness of the oxygen within the alcohol group, with respect to the ester group as has been previously reported [12,31–33]. Hydrogen addition produced a decrease in the particle number concentration between 30 and 300 nm at low and high engine loads, a range corresponding to where most of the particles are emitted. This reduction in particle number concentration is obtained for all the tested fuels as can be seen in Fig. 8. Firstly, this decrease is based on the replacement of liquid fuel by hydrogen. This serves to avoid particle precursors and formation (in the absence of carbon). As part of the liquid fuel is replaced, the number of locally fuel rich zones (where particles are formed) in the combustion chamber are reduced inhibiting soot formation. Some of hydrogen in the hydrogen–air mixture promoted the formation of OH radicals during compression and combustion, where the temperature and pressure are high enough for the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen to occur [34]. As the OH radical is efficient in soot and precursor oxidation, this can lead to a reduction in the particle surface area and the number of soot nuclei [35]. Total particle number (a statistical parameter derived from the particle number size distribution) is shown in Fig. 9 a. The total particle number concentration for the RME and butanol blends is notably lower than for diesel at both engine loads, due to the oxygen content and absence of aromatics in the biofuels. The particle mass concentration was estimated from the particle number concentration using an agglomerate density function which decreased as agglomerate size increased [36] (Fig. 9b). The same trend was obtained for the different liquid fuels. The addition of hydrogen linearly decreased the total number and mass of particles for all liquid fuels at both engine loads. At high load, the overall equivalence ratio, the number of fuel rich regions in the combustion chamber and the total particle concentration was higher than at low load. The high load represented a critical condition in terms of PM formation compared to the low load and for this reason the addition of hydrogen was more effective than at low load. This is despite that the liquid fuel replacement was lower. Comparing different fuels, at high load, hydrogen addition is equally efficient for all the tested blends, while at low load it seems to be slightly more efficient for diesel because PM emissions were already low compared to when oxygenated blends are used. As the number of particles was lower in the case of oxygenated fuels and with hydrogen addition, the probability of collisions between particles was reduced resulting overall in smaller mean diameter agglomerates. Smaller particles are more difficult to trap, they have a longer residence time in the atmosphere and they are more reactive. As a consequence, the emission of smaller particles provokes more harmful environmental and health effects. It should be noted that the lower mean diameter corresponding to the particles emitted with the oxygenated fuels and hydrogen was not caused by an increase in the number of smaller particles but a significant reduction in the number of larger particles [37]."
7,"Effect of oxygenated fuels, hydrogen and EGR on NOx-PM trade-off","3.5 Effect of oxygenated fuels, hydrogen and EGR on NOx-PM trade-off NOx and PM emissions are simultaneously shown in Fig. 10 a for RME and butanol blends at different percentages of hydrogen addition. The RME emissions are used as reference curve to study the effect of butanol and hydrogen combinations. The incorporation of the hydroxyl group and the increase in the oxygen content in the blended fuel when butanol replaced RME resulted in reductions in PM emissions at both engine loads. This gave a double benefit of a reduction in PM obtained by the combination of butanol and hydrogen. Although in this work the hydrogen addition tended to increase NOx emissions because of the faster combustion of hydrogen especially at high load. The use of hydrogen at less than 2% of volumetric air flow rate did not show a significant penalty in NOx emissions. In the case of B16R even though hydrogen addition slightly increased NOx, it was concluded that the addition of hydrogen and butanol to RME resulted in lower PM and NOx emissions compared to pure RME, thus breaking the NOx-PM trade-off. To improve the NOx emissions caused by the addition of hydrogen, three different conditions of EGR rate were investigated and their effects on B16R blended with hydrogen are shown in Fig. 10b. It can be seen that EGR showed a significant reduction in NOx emissions. This is a well-known consequence of the dilution, chemical and thermal effects of EGR [38]. The recirculation of the inert gas, such as carbon dioxide and water vapour, resulted in a delay in the combustion process with the diluted air. Consequently the whole combustion process was shifted further to the expansion stroke which led to lower in-cylinder temperatures, diminishing NOx formation [39]. The reduction in NOx emissions by EGR was more pronounced than the increase caused by hydrogen addition. It is also well-established that an increase in PM emissions using EGR should be expected. However oxygenated fuels (such as biodiesel and alcohols) produce lower PM emissions compared to diesel, reducing the recirculation of PM through EGR. The recirculation of less PM emissions into the combustion chamber limited particle nucleation and surface growth reducing PM formation [40]. Therefore, for the biodiesel and alcohol blends the application of EGR resulted in a lower increase in PM emissions than in the case of diesel, improving the NOx/PM trade-off [17]. Hydrogen can also assist in controlling PM emissions with EGR. For instance, when 10% EGR was applied at low load, 1% of hydrogen shows similar PM emissions compared to the engine operating without hydrogen and without EGR. Higher PM emissions produced by higher EGR rates may need more hydrogen to limit the PM penalty. However, this needs careful consideration because of the reduction in oxygen from the addition of hydrogen. This could result in a deficient combustion and a reduction in PM oxidation leading to no further benefits."
8,Conclusions,"A study of the effect of butanol and hydrogen addition on combustion characteristics and emissions of biodiesel fuel has been conducted. This research has shown favourable synergetic effects in terms of combustion characteristics and engine-out emissions when butanol and RME are blended. Therefore, it is envisaged that a combination of renewable fuels rather than the use of one single fuel is more a feasible alternative for next generation fuels. This approach will exclude the dependence on a single component as well as offer better emissions benefits. The potential to combine hydrogen as a combustion enhancer with biodiesel–butanol blends has been demonstrated. The addition of hydrogen represents an ideal alternative to counteract some of the combustion and emissions penalties (e.g. THC) due to the presence of butanol in blended fuels. Further beneficial emission effects (e.g. CO, PM) are found through the interaction of hydrogen with these blends. However, it is suggested that a limit be imposed on the hydrogen induction at high loads as further hydrogen was shown to significantly increase NOx emissions. The implementation of EGR with oxygenated blends and hydrogen is an attractive approach to reduce NOx emissions while reducing the PM penalty associated with EGR through limiting the PM and hydrocarbon recirculation. It is envisaged that this emissions benefit as well as the increase in the NO2/NOx ratio will have significant benefits in the function of aftertreatment systems (e.g. enhance passive regeneration in the diesel particulate filter)."
