0,Introduction,"Because of environmental problem and possible energy crisis in fossil oil production shortage and energy sustainability, the use and development of clean, renewable and sustainable energy sources are of imperative importance. Biomass is derived from solar power as potential and accepted modality of renewable energy and is seen as a method of helping reduce the influence of global warming and displacing the use of fossil fuels [4,6]. Biomass fast pyrolysis could be one of the most efficient and promising routes in biomass conversion and is of growing interest due to the relative simplicity of the process and the main product bio-oil being in the form of liquid which can be readily stored and transported [15,18]. However, the bio-oil obtained through pyrolysis is difficult to be used directly as fuel due to its poor quality. One of the major reasons in the conversion of biomass pyrolysis to high value products and fuels is the poor stability of the bio-oil [36,43]. One of the issues concerning bio-oil is its high oxidative property and chemical instability during storage. It is necessary to reduce rate of aging, to increase the stability and the pH value of bio-oil and to know the thermal and chemical stability of the bio-oil during storage [12]. The addition of organic solvent to the bio-oil has been proven to reduce the aging rate of the bio-oil and its effect was even more significant when added before the storage at high temperature of the bio-oil [3,12]. In order to demonstrate the role of oxygen in the stability of bio-oil, researchers have been working on stabilizing the bio-oils for various applications [7,9–11,42]. The additive added to bio-oil is significant to improve the undesirable properties of the bio-oil but the cost of additive limits its commercial application [22,41]. Adding alcohol as a solvent into bio-oil has been proven to be an effective approach to reduce the cost and improve the stability of bio-oils [24,28,29]. Industrial alcohol composed of 95% alcohol and 5% menthol is cheaper than pure alcohol, however, its effect on bio-oil stability has not yet been investigated. In our previous work, the effect of additive combination on stability of bio-oil was better than single additives using a fast aging experiment at 80 °C for 24 h [40]. However, the effect on stability of bio-oil for long storage three months should be studied further. In this study, the thermal stability change and the aging evaluation of bio-oil has been monitored and described. Effects of different mass fraction of industrial alcohol additive (10 wt.% and 20 wt.%), additive combination (ethanol: 6.58 wt.%, acetonitrile: 1.00 wt.%, methyl acetate: 2.42 wt.%) and crude bio-oil (blank) on the physicochemical characterization of pine sawdust bio-oil from fast pyrolysis in 1–5 kg/h bench-scale fluidized bed reactor were investigated. And the stability of the bio-oil was also studied. Bio-oil stability and possible aging mechanisms can be elucidated for aged bio-oil with addition of different mass concentrations of industrial alcohol additive and additive combination according to analytical methods such as GC × GC-TOFMS and FT-IR spectroscopies."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass feedstock,"2.1 Biomass feedstock Biomass feedstock used in this work was pine sawdust obtained from wood-working factory in Minhang District of Shanghai, P.R.China. The biomass material was ground and sieved from different mesh to a particle size range of 0.2–0.5 mm and was selected for bio-oil production using fast pyrolysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of pine sawdust."
3,Bio-oil production,"2.2 Bio-oil production The production of bio-oil from pine sawdust samples was performed in a fluidized bed reactor fast pyrolysis unit as shown in Fig. 1 . The unit mainly consisted of a feedstock hopper, two twin-screw feeders, a fluidized bed reactor, a cyclone, a hot vapors filter, four water-cooled condenser, an electrostatic static precipitator (ESP), a gas sampling point, and a N2 control valve. The feedstock hopper was made from common steel plate and had a capacity of 1–5 kg/h feedstock sample. The detailed description of the pyrolysis reactor system can be seen in reference [5]."
4,Experimental design and bio-oil analysis,"2.3 Experimental design and bio-oil analysis 2.3.1 Experimental design The bio-oil sample was produced from fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust in the fluidized bed reactor at 500 °C with hot vapor filter. Industrial alcohol at 10 wt.% (10% IA bio-oil), and 20 wt.% (20% IA bio-oil), and additive combination at ethanol: 6.58%, acetonitrile: 1.00%, methyl acetate: 2.42% (AC bio-oil) were added to crude bio-oils, respectively. The crude bio-oil without addition of additive was used as blank. The proportion and composition of additive mixtures were reported by our previous work [40]. During natural aging (25 °C), bio-oil samples were stored for three months for characterization. During storage, the bio-oils were subjected to property analyses, which included water content, solids content, ash content, pH, density, viscosity, and heating value. The experiments were repeated three time and the results were averaged. The water content, pH value, and viscosity were investigated every 10 days. In addition, solid content, ash content, density, heating value, GC × GC-TOFMS analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy were tested at storage day 0 and 90th day in order to investigate the effect of additives on the physicochemical characterization of bio-oils during storage. 2.3.2 Water content The water content of bio-oil samples was determined using Karl-Fischer titration (precision 0.01%) (KFT 870, Swiss Manthon Instrument Factory) according to ASTM E 203 by volumetric Karl-Fischer titration technique. 2.3.3 Solid content The solid content of bio-oil was determined as ethanol insoluble by using a vacuum millipore filtration system. The mixture solution of bio-oil and ethanol was filtered through a pre-weighed and pre-dried 0.22 μm pore size organic membrane paper. 2.3.4 Ash content Approximately 5 g of bio-oil sample was heated and burned in a furnace at set temperature 775 °C for 24 h until constant weight was reached and then cooled to room temperature. 2.3.5 pH value The pH value of the bio-oil samples was measured by pH meter (PHS-3C, Shanghai Lei Ci Instrument plant) at room temperature. 2.3.6 Density The density of bio-oil was analyzed at 25 °C by using a density meter (Anton Paar, DMA 4100 M), which is accurate to 0.0001 g/cm3 according to ASTM D4502. 2.3.7 Viscosity The kinematic viscosity of the bio-oil samples was determined according to ASTM D445 using a capillary viscometer (SYD-265C, Shanghai Changji Gealogical Instruments Co., Ltd.). Approximately 10 g bio-oil sample was put into the kinematic viscosity tube (length: 269 mm, inner diameter: 1.5 mm) and was allowed to flow freely at a constant temperature of 40 °C. 2.3.8 Heating value The heating value of bio-oil samples was investigated using an oxygen bomb calorimeter (precision 0.01 MJ kg−1) (XRY-1B, Shanghai Changji Gealogical Instruments Co., Ltd.) according to ASTM D240. 2.3.9 Two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) GC × GC-TOFMS analysis was carried out to identify compounds of crude bio-oil and bio-oils with addition of additive. It contained an Agilent 7890A GC with injector Agilent 7683B series (Agilent Technologies, USA) connected to a Pegasus 4D time-of flight mass spectrometer from Leco Instruments and a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm thickness). 2.3.10 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy The FT-IR spectra of the bio-oil samples were recorded in the transmission mode between 4000 cm−1 and 400 cm−1 using a Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer by KBr smear."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of additive on bio-oil properties,"3.1 Effects of additive on bio-oil properties 3.1.1 Water content Fig. 2 shows the change of water content of bio-oil samples during storage for 90 days. The water content of all the bio-oil samples increased during the whole period of storage up to 30 days. However, the water content of the bio-oil samples exhibited a slow decrease tendency from 30 days to 70 days. After 70 days of storage, a fast increasing tendency in the water content of the bio-oil samples was observed. The water contents of all the bio-oil samples maintained the same variation tendency, except for AC bio-oil during storage for 40 days. After storage, the values of water content increased by 9.97% (crude bio-oil), 14.17% (10% IA bio-oil), 8.22% (20% IA bio-oil) and 12.21% (AC bio-oil), respectively, compared with that of 0 day. Finally, the water content of crude bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil and 20% IA bio-oil were above 8.50 wt.%, compared with 8.06 wt.% of AC bio-oil. Compared with industrial alcohol additives, the function of additive combination could decrease the water content clearly with the same variation trend during the storage. 3.1.2 Ash content and solid content Fig. 3 shows ash content and solid content of bio-oil samples for 0 day and 90 days. The results of Fig. 3 showed that the ash content and solids content of the blank bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil, and AC bio-oil changed slightly during the storage. After storage, the ash content of each group increased to 0.46 wt.% (crude bio-oil), 0.38 wt.% (10% IA bio-oil), 0.36 wt.% (20% IA bio-oil) and 0.41 wt.% (AC bio-oil) from 0.39 wt.%, 0.35 wt.%, 0.32wt.% and 0.36 wt.%, respectively. Compared with the values at beginning of storage, the ash contents of all samples increased in the experiments. The solid content of each group was fluctuant, and the value was 0.28 wt.% (crude bio-oil), 0.13 wt.% (10% IA bio-oil), 0.23 wt.% (20% IA bio-oil) and 0.16 wt.% (AC bio-oil) compared to 0.15 wt.%, 0.15 wt.%, 0.17 wt.% and 0.18 wt.%, respectively. The result of solid content showed that industrial alcohol additive and mixture addition agent had no obvious influence on solid content due to the reasons that hot vapor filter (HVF) had significantly reduced the solid content of bio-oil [27]. 3.1.3 pH value Fig. 4 shows the change of pH value of bio-oil samples during storage for 90 days. Results of Fig. 4 showed that pH value of bio-oil with addition of industrial alcohol and additive combination increased in varying degrees. pH values of bio-oils before storage were 3.12 (10% IA bio-oil), 3.41 (20% IA bio-oil) and 3.15 (AC bio-oil), respectively, compared with 2.82 (crude bio-oil). It is of obvious significance to improve the pH value of the bio-oil with solvent addition. The best improvement result was 20% IA bio-oil with a 20.92% increase of pH value, compared to crude bio-oil. The difference of pH value between 10% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil during storage was inconspicuous. It was due to the two main mechanisms: the neutral dilution effect of the additive and additive would inhibit the H+ activity of bio-oil [12]. The pH value variation trend of 10% IA bio-oil increased in the first 30 days, and then decreased in the last 60 days. By contrast, pH value of AC bio-oil gradually decreased in the first 50 days and then gradually increased in the last 40 days. The rank of effect of the additives on improving pH value was 20% IA > 10% IA > AC in the first 50 days and 20% IA > AC > 10% IA in the last 40 days. After storage, the values were 2.99 of 10% IA bio-oil, 3.36 of 20% IA bio-oil and 3.04 of AC bio-oil, compared with 2.75 of crude bio-oil, respectively. The decreased rates of addition of industrial alcohol and additive combination were 4.17%, 1.47% and 2.56%, compared with 2.48% of crude bio-oil, respectively. Finally, the rank of effect of the additives on improving pH value was 20% IA > 10% IA and AC. During the storage, pH value of crude bio-oil showed a slight decrease trend on the whole, and the pH value of 10% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil was equivalent. This contributes to aging reactions such as polymerization including esterification and etherification occurred in the acid environment [19]. 3.1.4 Density Fig. 5 shows the change of density of bio-oil samples during storage for 90 days. By comparison, additives could reduce the density at varying degrees. When additives were added, the density value decreased from 1.22 g/cm3 to 1.17 g/cm3 (10% IA bio-oil), 1.12 g/cm3 (20% IA bio-oil) and 1.16 g/cm3 (AC bio-oil), respectively. When additives were added compared with crude bio-oil, the values of density in 10% IA bio-oil and 20% IA bio-oil immediately decreased by 4% and 9%, respectively. The AC bio-oil obtained almost same effect with 10% IA bio-oil. The change of density of the bio-oils with and without additives fluctuated during storage. As Fig. 5 shows, the densities of the crude bio-oil and 10% IA bio-oil were increased and that of 20% IA bio-oil decreased. Finally, the density values were 1.17 g/cm3 for 10% IA bio-oil, 1.11 g/cm3 for 20% IA bio-oil and 1.16 g/cm3 for 20% IA bio-oil at 90 days, compared to 1.23 g/cm3 for crude bio-oil, respectively. The values of density in 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil were reduced by 5%, 9%, 5%, respectively, compared with the crude bio-oil stored for 90 days. The effect of 20% IA bio-oil was more obvious than others. The most important observations from density trends was that density increased with increasing carbon number for similar chemical structures and decreasing hydrogen to carbon ratio [33]. 3.1.5 Viscosity Fig. 6 shows the effects of industrial alcohol and additive combination on the viscosity of fresh and aged 90 days bio-oils. It is apparent from Fig. 6 that the crude bio-oil had significant higher viscosity than the bio-oil with additives. In other words, the industrial alcohol and additive combination could improve the bio-oil viscosity. The viscosity of the bio-oil decreased from 122.8 mm2/s to 37.15 mm2/s, 15.94 mm2/s and 34.42 mm2/s when 10%, 20% of industrial alcohol, and additive combination were added at storage time of 0 days, respectively. The decreasing rates were 72%, 87%, and 73%, respectively, which were improved compared with that of the crude bio-oil. After stored for 90 days, viscosities of crude bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil were increased to 57.23, 26.91 and 55.69 mm2/s, respectively, which were improved compared with that of crude bio-oil (174.94 mm2/s). And the increased rates of bio-oil were 200%, 54%, 69%, and 62%, respectively. The difference among the viscosities of the 10% industrial alcohol and additive combination was negligible. Nevertheless, when the adding percentage of industrial alcohol was increased from 10% to 20%, it could be seen that the higher the concentration of industrial alcohol, the lower the viscosity of bio-oil [29]. Also, additive combination appeared to be slightly more effective than the same proportion of industrial alcohol (10% IA bio-oil). The bio-oils with additives remained a single phase throughout the period of three months while the phase of crude bio-oil separated. Thus, for current results, the effect of additive combination was a slight superior to 10% IA bio-oil to reduce the viscosity of bio-oil, but much worse than 20% IA bio-oil. 3.1.6 Higher heating value (HHV) The effects of industrial alcohol and additive combination on the heating value of bio-oil are illustrated in Fig. 7 . When 10% industrial alcohol and 20% industrial alcohol were added, the heating value increased from 25.01 MJ/kg to 25.64 MJ/kg, and 25.95 MJ/kg, respectively. The increase of the heating value by 20% industrial alcohol was larger than that by 10% industrial alcohol because the heating value of industrial alcohol is higher than that of bio-oil. In addition, when additive combination was added, the heating value increased from 25.01 MJ/kg to 25.86 MJ/kg at 0 day. The effect of 20% IA was superior to 10% IA bio-oil and additive combination to increase HHV of bio-oil. However, during storage for 90 days, the heating values of all samples were alleviated more or less. Finally, at 90 days, the heating values of crude bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil were decreased by 2%, 2%, 4%, and 7%, respectively, compared to 0 day. The decreased heating value of the aged bio-oil was due to polymerization reaction during storage [37]."
7,GC × GC-TOFMS analysis,"3.2 GC × GC-TOFMS analysis Compound identification in bio-oil has been described in previous papers [2,14,35]; [38]. The relative contents of relative peak area were summarized and classified by phenols, ketones, aldehydes, acids, furans, alkanes, esters, sugars and alcohols. Fig. 8 shows relative peak area percentage distribution of component groups in crude bio-oil and 10% IA bio-oil before aging (0 day) and after aging (90 days). Fig. 9 shows relative peak area percentage distribution of component groups in 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil before aging (0 day) and after aging (90 days). The relative content of relative peak area percentage could reveal and clarify the change of chemical composition of bio-oil samples during the storage which is better than using of relative mass contents detected by GC–MS [32,34]. Major differences were found when comparing the chemical content of the crude bio-oil after additives were added. The aged bio-oils after 90 days storage had a lower levels of phenols than that of the fresh bio-oils. After storage 90 days, the contents of phenols were decreased from 20.19% of crude bio-oil, 19.14% of 10% IA bio-oil, 19.21% of 20% IA bio-oil and 20.04% of AC bio-oil to 19.62%, 18.03%, 18.72% and 19.46%, respectively. And the decreased rates were 2.82%, 5.80%, 2.55% and 2.89%, respectively. Meng et al. shows that molecular weight increase could be due to reactions of phenol or substituted phenols with aldehydes to form polymers [23]. When the storage time of 0 day and 90 days was compared, the main fluctuation of organic substance during storage indicated that the light component including some acids and aldehydes was declined in GC × GC-analyzable parts. The contents of acid were decreased by 38.80% of crude bio-oil, 9.03% of 10% IA bio-oil, 37.86% of 20% IA bio-oil and 33.84% of AC bio-oil, compared with storage time of 0 day. The content of aldehydes in bio-oil fraction decreased continuously during storage. After storage, the contents of crude bio-oil, 10% IA bio-oil, 20% IA bio-oil, and AC bio-oil were 1.62%, 2.04%, 2.57% and 1.92% respectively, which had been decreased by 57.14%, 41.55%, 21.17% and 52.94%, respectively, compared with 3.78%, 3.49%, 2.57% and 1.92% before storage. After stabilization, aldehydes, acids and furans were reduced and converted to the corresponding esters, ethers, acetals and ketals due to esterification and etherification [20]. The content of alcohols was found to increase with added additive which may be an indication that all the additives contained ethanol. This study did not show major differences in furans, alkanes, and sugars but the content of ketones, and esters was increased due to esterification reaction occurred [1,8,17,39]."
8,Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,"3.3 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy Fig. 10 shows FT-IR spectra of bio-oil samples of crude bio-oil and 10% IA bio-oil for storage 0 day and 90 days. Fig. 11 shows FT-IR spectra of bio-oil samples of crude 20% IA bio-oil and AC bio-oil for storage 0 day and 90 days. In order to find more assignment correlation of FT-IR spectra of Figs. 10 and 11, the functional groups and structures were evaluated and assigned [17,21,25,30,31,38]. Table 2 showed the evaluation and assignment of the FT-IR spectrum of the bio-oil. From Table 2, the structure of aged bio-oils was changed compared with before storage. The OH stretching vibrations between 3250 cm−1 and 3500 cm−1 was associated with the presence of OH stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups, such as phenols, alcohols and water. And formation of broad absorbance is due to hydrogen bond effect [17]. The aliphatic hydrogen at 2963 cm−1, 2935 cm−1, 1,455 cm−1 and 1374 cm−1 belong to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration shoulder of the aliphatic CH3 group, bending vibrations of the CH2 and CH3 aliphatic groups and symmetric deformation of CH in methyl groups, respectively. It indicated that a large part of components of bio-oil samples was long carbon chain [38]. Compared with crude bio-oil, the bio-oils with additives stored for 90 days, CO stretching vibrations in unconjugated ketones, carbonyl and ester groups at 1,714 cm−1 and CO stretching vibrations at 1603 cm−1 were changed. The peak of spectra has shift 3–5 wavenumbers to high wavenumber region. It indicated that some of the reactive compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes during storage occurred [11,16]. Furthermore, weak peaks at 1,115 cm−1, 1180 cm−1 and 1,028 cm−1 were strengthened while stored for 90 days, which were the peaks of vibrations of ester linkage, deformation vibrations of CO bonds in secondary alcohols and aliphatic ethers and stretching vibration of the CO ester groups, respectively. It is indicated that bio-oil samples consisted of various ester compounds and consistent with the result of GC × GC-TOFMS analysis. Polymerization reaction that requires the change of activation energy [13] occurred for bio-oil at 90 days storage. The peaks of 1514 cm−1, 1047 cm−1, and 925 cm−1 were assigned to aromatic ring vibrations, aromatics with various types of substitution and deformation vibrations of CH bonds in aromatic rings, respectively. It is elucidated that bio-oil consists of amount of aromatic compounds, and some researches showed that furans and furanones are a large portion of these aromatic compounds [16,26,37]. It is proved that aldehydes, ketones, and furans are derived mostly from cellulose [16]. Since the bio-oil contained mainly guaiacyl units, vibrations of guaiacyl rings and stretching vibrations of CO bonds, the intense deformation vibration of CH bonds in guaiacyl rings and aromatic out-of-plane CH bending in positions 2, 5, and 6 of guaiacyl units appeared at 1277 cm−1, 1141 cm−1 and 859 cm−1. The FT-IR band shifts at 890 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 were used as a signature in monitoring the bio-oil quality, which was assigned to out-of-plane deformation vibration of CH of terminal olefins and overlapping of the CH2 rocking vibration and the out-of-plane vibration of cis-disubstituted olefins [21,38]. It was indicated that bio-oil samples consisted of various olefins compounds. The experimental results above clearly demonstrated that the FT-IR method was an ideal fast monitoring method for monitoring the bio-oil aging process at long-term storage at ambient temperatures. Key intermediates of the bio-oil aging process were identified qualitatively using the FT-IR spectroscopy."
9,Conclusions,"The results indicated that addition of industrial alcohol and additive combination had a significant beneficial effect on improving the physicochemical characterization of bio-oil. (i) Additions of industrial alcohol and additive combination were more effective than crude bio-oil in terms of quality improvement measured from water content, pH, viscosity, HHV and density values and could decrease the extent of bio-oil aging. (ii) Additives had no significant impact on solid content due to the effect of filtration using hot vapor filter. (iii) GC × GC-TOFMS indicated that the aged bio-oil had a lower levels of phenols than that of crude bio-oil. After stabilization, the contents of ketones and esters were increased but acids and ketones were reduced and converted to alcohols. (iv) The FT-IR analysis demonstrated that the structures of bio-oils were slightly changed and polymerization occurred such as alcohols and aldehydes during storage. (v) 20% industrial alcohol was superior to 10% industrial alcohol and additive combination for the improvement of bio-oil stability."
