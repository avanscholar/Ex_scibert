0,Introduction,"The environmental issue and energy crisis are important challenges in the process of human sustainable development [1,2]. The use of earth-abundant solar energy to exploit clean new energy is an important strategy to solve those problems [3,4]. Hydrogen is an ideal clean energy source, the photocatalytic hydrogen production utilizing solar energy by splitting water is an important method for producing clean hydrogen energy, which can effectively convert solar energy into chemical energy [5–12]. Ammonia (NH3) is not only a necessity for producing various chemicals (such as fertilizers) in modern society, but also an important clean energy carrier [13–18]. Artificial nitrogen fixation technology has received extensive attention, and photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is a green, economical, and efficient way to synthesize NH3 [19–22]. The photocatalytic process of photocatalysts mainly involves three steps: the semiconductor absorbs sunlight; the semiconductor is excited to produce photogenerated electrons and holes; the electrons migrate to conduction band (CB) to participate in reduction reaction and the holes generated in valence band (VB) to participate in the oxidation reaction [23,24,25]. In essence, to achieve the effective photocatalytic activity, the semiconductor must meet the following requirements: (i) CB edge must be higher than reduction potential, (ii) absorbing more sunlight to promote photo-excitation process, (iii) generating more photogenerated electrons and holes, (iv) photoexcited electrons and holes must have a good migration rate with a low recombination possibility, (v) good interfacial contact between photocatalysts and reaction solvent, (vi) good stability, and (vii) low cost [1,5,13,19,20,23]. Recently, hundreds of photocatalysts have been prepared for photocatalytic hydrogen production and nitrogen fixation [1–3,13–20]. CdS, as a photocatalyst, has been extensively studied due to its proper CB edge, relatively narrow band gap width (~2.4 eV), simple preparation method and low cost [26–32]. Nevertheless, further application of CdS is limited, owing to the fast photoexcited carrier recombination, low visible light utilization and low light stability, thus many efforts, such as impurity doping, heterojunction construction and co-catalyst loading, are used to improve the photocatalytic performance of CdS [22,33–37]. Wang et al. [26] indicated that the enhanced photocatalytic capability of unique one-dimensional (1D) multi-node MoS2/CdS hetero-nanorods is attributed to the intimate heterojunctions and the well-defined nanostructure. Meng et al. [38] prepared MoS2@CdS composites by ball-milling and calcination, exhibiting a greatly improved photocatalytic H2 production activity (1315 μmol h−1). Peng et al. [39] used MoS2/rGO hybrid as an effective co-catalyst to incorporation with CdS nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited a much greater photocatalytic activity. Besides, some researchers loaded noble metals as co-catalysts (such as Pt) on CdS to drive a photocatalytic reaction for increasing the photocatalytic activity [2,10,17,21,26,38]. The co-catalysts serve as bridges to improve interfacial carrier transfer and act as sites for reduction reactions. However, extreme scarcity and high price of noble metals limit their applications [23,26]. Thus, finding the highly active, low-cost and stable earth-rich non-noble metal co-catalysts is urgent for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of CdS. Since the discovery of 2D MXene in 2011, MXene has been explored for application due to its tunable interlayer spacing, tailored surface chemistry, and unique electrical, optical, and thermodynamic properties [40,41,42]. Both theoretical and experimental studies indicate that MXene has excellent metallic conductivity and unique electronic properties, it has attracted considerable attention as a promising substitute for noble metal co-catalysts [2,5,23,28,42,43]. Thus, MXene combining with semiconductor materials can improve photogenerated carrier transfer rate, inhibit carrier recombination, and promote the improvement of photocatalytic activity [41–46]. Qiao et al. [45] employ density functional theory calculations to direct atomic-level exploration, design and fabrication of Ti3C2 nanoparticles as a highly efficient co-catalyst, proving that Ti3C2 can serve as an efficient co-catalyst on CdS. Li et al. [42] focus on the research on MXene as co-catalysts in photocatalytic applications (hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, and organic pollutant oxidation), revealing the co-catalytic effect of MXene. Recently, Xu et al. [47–49] reported 1D CdS NWs/2D Ti3C2Tx MXene composites in photocatalytic coupling redox reaction of H2 evolution and selective conversion of bioethanol into 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE) under acidic conditions, prepared Ti3C2Tx MXene NSs/CdS NPs in the aqueous-phase photoredox conversion of furfural alcohol to furfural and H2 by simultaneously utilizing photoexcited holes and electrons, and researched 2D in-plane CdS/Ti3C2Tx sheet-onto-sheet heterostructures with Ti3C2Tx MXene as a cocatalyst for concurrently promoted photoactivity and inhibited photocorrosion. Liu et al. [50] fabricated the 1D CdS nanorod/2D Ti3C2 MXene nanosheet Schottky heterojunction toward enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Xiang et al. [51] reported noble-metal-free Ti3C2Tx/CdS hybrids with oxygen-containing groups with a high hydrogen-production rate. Although CdS/MXene composite photocatalysts have been extensively studied, the research on photocatalytic activity of ammonia synthesis has not been reported. Here, we designed the 1D/2D CdS nanorod@Ti3C2 MXene (CdS@Ti3C2) composites photocatalyst based on Ti3C2 MXene through the combination of co-catalyst strategy and morphology engineering. The rich surface functional group of Ti3C2 MXene is beneficial to the construction of 1D/2D CdS@Ti3C2 composites and promotes the strong interface contacts between co-catalyst and photocatalyst. In addition, Ti3C2 MXene with excellent electron conductivity can capture photogenerated electrons to improve charge separation efficiency, act as active sites for H2 generation and NH3 synthesis, and adjust the energy band position of CdS for making a more favorable energy band structure of the reduction reaction. With this strategy, photoexcited carriers are efficiently separated, active sites are increased, light trapping ability is improved, and the photocatalytic activity is significantly enhanced. The best sample of CdS@Ti3C2-15 with 15 mg Ti3C2 MXene adding amount exhibits super good photocatalytic H2 production activity with the rate of 63.53 μmol h−1 and the apparent quantum efficiency of 2.28%. Besides, CdS@Ti3C2-15 also owns favorable photocatalytic N2 fixation performance (293.06 μmol L−1h−1) and the apparent quantum efficiency of 7.88%. Moreover, the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite shows good long-term stability. The photocatalytic performance of CdS@Ti3C2-15 is far better than those of pure CdS nanorods (NRs) and CdS with Pt as co-catalyst. Our research provides new insight and guidance for co-catalyst strategies of CdS-based semiconductor photocatalysts."
1,Results and discussion,"For the construction of 1D/2D CdS@Ti3C2 composites, CdS NRs are grown on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets (NSs) via the hydrothermal method. A schematic for the synthesis strategy of the structures of the CdS@Ti3C2 composites photocatalysts is demonstrated in Scheme 1 . Initially, Ti3C2 MXene NSs are prepared by selective etching Al layers in Ti3AlC2 with HF acid. Then, the 1D/2D CdS@Ti3C2 composites were fabricated via one-step hydrothermal synthesis by using sublimed sulfur, cadmium acetate dihydrate, ethylenediamine, and Ti3C2 MXene as the growth substrate. Ultimately, CdS@Ti3C2 composites were formed. XRD analysis associated with Ti3AlC2, Ti3C2 MXene, CdS NRs and 1D/2D CdS@Ti3C2 composites are performed (Fig. 1 and S1). For the XRD pattern of Ti3AlC2 (curve black), the strongest XRD peak of Ti3AlC2 (JCPDS No. 52–0875) appears (2θ = 38°), which is consistent with previous reports [5,23]. From Fig. S1a, compared with Ti3AlC2, the diffraction peak of Ti3C2 is shifted to a small angle as a whole, where the (002) diffraction peak is decreased from 9.4° to 8.5°, the (004) diffraction peak is decreased from 19.1° to 18.2°, and the (006) crystal plane diffraction peak appears at 27.4°. In addition, the characteristic peak signals in 33.9°, 39.0°, 41.6°, and 60.1° disappear, which indicated that the Ti-Al metal bond rupture with weak bond energy in Ti3AlC2, and the Al is successfully removed [23,44]. And, the diffraction peak in Ti3C2 is broadened, and the interlayer spacing is expanded from 9.2 Å to 10.1 Å, indicating the formation of Ti3C2 MXene accordion-like layer structure [23,40]. Furthermore, we performed the Raman spectra of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2 (Fig. S2). For Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2, there are four characteristic bands appeared at ca. 196, 261, 388 and 595 cm−1, and ca. 128, 209, 327 and 584 cm−1, respectively, which attributed to the w1, w2, w3, and w4 Raman-active phonon vibration modes [44]. Noticeably, the Raman band modes of Ti3C2 are blue-shifted due to the delamination of Ti3AlC2 by HF etching, and the intensity of w1 and w2 are significantly reduced or even disappeared, which can indicate that the successful preparation of Ti3C2 [20,44]. Besides, the distinct characteristic diffraction peaks of TiC are observed at 34.0° and 41.9° due to the inclusion of impurity TiC in the raw material of Ti3AlC2. The XRD pattern of CdS (curve purple) confirms that the samples are composed of hexagonal wurtzite structure phase CdS (JCPDS No. 41–1049) [22,35]. For the XRD pattern of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (curve pink), the characteristic peaks of CdS and the diffraction peaks corresponding to the (002) and (004) plane of Ti3C2 do not change, indicating that the combination of Ti3C2 MXene and CdS does not affect the crystal structure of each other. This may indicate that the significant increase in photocatalytic activity (see below) is not caused by crystal structure change in CdS, but because of the co-catalytic effect of Ti3C2 as a growth substrate. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of Ti3C2 (Fig. S1) increase with the increase of the adding amount of Ti3C2. All CdS@Ti3C2 composites exhibit the similar diffraction peak positions, showing that the crystal structures of the different composite are not changed, indicating the difference in photocatalytic performance (see below) is only related to the content of Ti3C2 MXene of all samples. The morphology of Ti3AlC2, Ti3C2 MXene, CdS NRs, and CdS@Ti3C2 composites are measured by SEM (Fig. 2 and S3). From Fig. 2 a and b, it can clearly show that the successfully removing of Al layers from Ti3AlC2 after HF etching, and the formation of 2D accordion-like Ti3C2 MXene. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, pure CdS exhibits 1D nanorod morphology, consistent with previous studies [26]. The 1D/2D CdS@Ti3C2 composites were prepared through CdS NRs growing on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene via the hydrothermal method (Fig. 2e, f and S3). From the SEM of CdS@Ti3C2 composites (Fig. 2e, f and S3), we can clearly discover that CdS NRs are grown well on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene, and the degree of encapsulation of CdS on Ti3C2 MXene surface decreases with the increase of the adding amount of Ti3C2 (Fig. 2e, f and S3). This unique 1D/2D composites structure facilitates the rapid transfer of electrons, enabling the photogenerated electrons generated by the photoexcitation process of CdS NRs can rapidly migrate to conductive Ti3C2 MXene. To further investigate the elemental content and distribution of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, we also use SEM-EDX to characterize Ti, C, Cd, and S. The SEM-EDX point scan image and element content of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite is shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1, and the SEM-EDX elemental mapping images are shown in Fig. S5. The result suggests the precise composition and well-defined spatial distribution of Ti, C, Cd, and S in the composite catalysts, confirming that CdS NRs are uniform distributed on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene, indicating that the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite is successfully prepared. To further study the morphology and crystal structure of 1D/2D CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, TEM, HRTEM and STEM-EDX are measured (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6). Both CdS NRs and the Ti3C2 MXene are clearly expressed in the TEM image of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (Fig. 3a and b). The clearly-observed lattice fringes of the CdS and Ti3C2 further suggest the successful preparation of the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (Fig. 3c and d). In detail, the interplanar spacing of 0.36 nm is attributed to (100) plane of hexagonal wurtzite structure phase CdS [22,52,53], and the interplanar spacing of 0.98 nm is indexed to (002) plane of Ti3C2 [1,5,23,45]. Besides, the HRTEM image presented intimate contact between CdS nanorod and Ti3C2 MXene with the large contact area, effectively facilitating the interfacial carrier transfer [3,5,23,43]. We also use scanning TEM (STEM) coupled with EDX to illustrate the well-defined spatial distribution of Cd, S, C, and Ti to confirm the composition of CdS NRs and Ti3C2 MXene in CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (Fig. S6), which further indicate the successfully prepared of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite. In order to further confirm the interaction between the Ti3C2 and CdS components in CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, and investigate the chemical composition and corresponding chemical bonding state, the XPS analysis of Ti3C2, CdS and CdS@Ti3C2-15 are conducted (Fig. 4 and S7). The XPS spectra of Ti3C2 and CdS proved their respective elemental composition (Fig. S7a and d), the peak of O 1s is attributable to O-containing compounds adsorbed on the surface of the material, and the peak of F 1s (617.03 eV) element is mainly attributed to the residual F ion of the HF solution [5,23]. The fully scanned spectrum of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite confirms that it consists of Ti, C, O, F, Cd and S (Fig. 4 a). In the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, CdS NRs are scattered growth on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene. The diffraction signal intensity of Ti 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 4b) is relatively low due to the XPS technique can only examine the composition of the surface layer (less than 5 nm depth) [1,44,45,54], it can be deconvoluted into four pairs of strong 2p1/2/2p3/2 doublets for Ti-O (463.71/457.67 eV), Ti-Ox (462.75/455.72 eV), Ti-x (461.65/454.88 eV), and Ti-C (460.28/454.11 eV) of Ti3C2, corresponding to the oxidation of Ti3C2, O-terminated of Ti3C2, F-terminated of Ti3C2, and the interaction of Ti and C, respectively. And, the increased diffraction peak compared with Ti3C2 (Fig. S7b), which is attributed to the hydrothermal process [44,45,55,56]. The abundant hydrophilic functionalities (-O, -Ox and -x) are conducive to the growth of CdS on the surface of Ti3C2 and tightly bind during hydrothermal treatment, and which also can act as the active site for reduction reactions, favoring to the embodiment of co-catalytic performance [45]. C 1s spectrum of Ti3C2 (Fig. S7c) is deconvolved into three peaks at 292.28, 284.76, and 281.68 eV, corresponding to C–F, C–C, and C–Ti–Ox bonds, respectively. By contrast, C 1s spectrum of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (Fig. 4c) is deconvolved into four peaks at 287.61, 285.51, 284.35 and 280.48 eV, attributing to C–F, C–O–C, C–C, and C–Ti–Ox bonds, the C–O–C bond is due to slight oxidation in the hydrothermal process [1,42,44,45]. And, we found that the binding energy corresponding to each bond has shifted because of the influence of CdS growing on the surface of Ti3C2 on its electronic structure, indicate the successfully prepared of composite material [45]. O 1s spectrum (Fig. 4d) shows three cyclotron peaks of C-Ti-OHx (530.99 eV), C-Ti-Ox (529.79 eV), and Ti-O (528.68 eV), attributing to the adsorption of H2O, adsorption of oxygen and the oxidation of Ti, respectively [44,45,57]. The Cd 3d spectrum of CdS NRs (Fig. S7e) presents two peaks at 404.84 and 411.59 eV, corresponding to Cd2+ 3d5/2 and Cd2+ 3d3/2, respectively [22,35]. While, the corresponding binding energy position of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (Fig. 4e) is negatively shifted by about 0.7 eV to Cd2+ 3d5/2 (404.15 eV) and Cd2+ 3d3/2 (410.87 eV), which attributed to Ti3C2 affects the electronic structure of CdS [45]. S 2p spectrum (Fig. 4f) presents two peaks at 160.47 and 161.63 eV, corresponding to S2− 2p3/2 and S2− 2p1/2 of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, respectively, it is also negatively shifted by about 0.7 eV compared with the corresponding peak of CdS NRs (Fig. S7f) [1,45,58]. The above results indicate that the formation of CdS@Ti3C2 composites and the influences of Ti3C2 on the electronic properties of CdS, consistent with the energy band analysis below. All samples (Fig. 5 ) can be categorized into the combination of type IV and II, reflecting the existence of mesopores and macropores of all samples [23,59]. The pore-size distribution curves (Fig. 5 inset) of CdS@Ti3C2-x, CdS NRs and Ti3C2 MXene reveal that the pore size is mostly 3–15 nm. The specific surface area of CdS@Ti3C2-5, CdS@Ti3C2-10, CdS@Ti3C2-15, CdS@Ti3C2-20, CdS@Ti3C2-25, CdS@Ti3C2-50 and CdS@Ti3C2-100 are 23.756, 26.123, 26.222, 25.065, 21.274, 5.428 and 5.267 m2 g−1, respectively. The corresponding pore volumes are 2.060 × 10−1, 2.062 × 10−1, 2.177 × 10−1, 1.703 × 10−1, 1.885 × 10−1, 1.118 × 10−1 and 8.545 × 10−2 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table S2). Surprisingly, CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite exhibits the relatively large specific surface area and pore volume among all samples, which is attributed to the special morphology of CdS@Ti3C2-15 and the appropriate ratio of Ti3C2 and CdS. From the Fig. 2 and S3, we can observe the difference in morphology of different composite materials, the dispersion of CdS NRs grown on Ti3C2 MXene of CdS@Ti3C2-15 is the best, so the specific surface area and pore volume are relatively higher. The relatively higher surface area and pore volume of CdS@Ti3C2-15 are beneficial to adequate contact of catalysts with reactants, which greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity [5,18,24]. The UV–vis DRS spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 a. Ti3C2 MXene (curve black in Fig. 6a) shows smooth light absorption of UV light and visible light, owing to its black nature [5,23]. The CdS NRs (curve blue in Fig. 6a) show remarkable UV and limited visible absorption. Compared to pure CdS NRs, CdS@Ti3C2 composites display an improved visible light absorption ranging from 500 to 800 nm due to the presence of Ti3C2 MXene. And, the more Ti3C2 added, the higher the light absorption in550–800 nm region of the composites due to the background light absorption of the MXene, the light absorption increases more obviously especially at low dosage (5–15 mg), which is favorable to improve photocatalytic activity [47,48]. Surprisingly, CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite shows good both UV and visible light absorption (curve red in Fig. 6a). From Fig. 6b, we can clearly observe the significant red shift of absorption edge from 548 nm of pure CdS NRs to 602 nm of the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite. The better visible absorption intensity and redshift of absorption edge both are beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic activity [5,24]. The band gap energy (Eg) of CdS NRs could be calculated (Fig. 6c) [5]. Thus, the Eg of CdS NRs is estimated to be about 2.40 eV, the suitable band gap can facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons after being excited by light, which is advantageous for the electrons generated by photoexcitation to be transferred from the CB to VB, and the reducing ability is improved [23,24]. The photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution was shown in Fig. 7 . There is no noticeable H2 production that is discovered without irradiation or photocatalyst. We first tested the photocatalytic hydrogen production of Ti3C2 MXene, which has no photocatalytic H2 production activity due to its metallic properties consistent with previous research [24,60]. From Fig. 7a, pure CdS NRs are photocatalytic inert toward H2 evolution under simulated solar light illumination, with a lower photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (14.48 μmol h−1) (Fig. 7a and b), maybe owing to the rapid recombination of photoexcited carriers [22,26,53]. Noticeably, the CdS@Ti3C2 composites exhibit the sharply improved photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and achieve maximal values on the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, reaching 63.53 μmol h−1 (4.39 times that CdS NRs). Such improved activity of CdS@Ti3C2 composites is ascribed to the following reasons: (1) Photoexcited electrons can efficiently transfer from CB of CdS to Ti3C2 MXene owing to large interface contact area; (2) Metallic Ti3C2 MXene increases conductivity and hydrophilic of the photocatalytic system; (3) The metallic Ti3C2 MXene in the composites can capture photoinduced electrons and serve as reduction active sites, which facilitate the activation of water molecules [45]. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performances of catalysts (Fig. 7b) increase linearly with the increase of the amount of Ti3C2 (from 5 to 15 mg), because of the amount of reduction active sites increasing. However, further increasing the amount of Ti3C2 (from 15 to 100 mg) results in a gradual decrease of photocatalytic performance. In the case of lower Ti3C2 content, although the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes is enough, the lack of Ti3C2 MXene can't effectively inhibit the photogenerated electron-hole recombination. In contrast, over-much Ti3C2 MXene cause light-blocking effect, and the metallicity of CdS@Ti3C2 composites gradually strengthened. Ti3C2 MXene can compete with CdS NRs to harvest the incident photons, decreasing the photocatalytic efficiency of CdS. Thus, controlling the ratio of Ti3C2 to CdS is key to realize optimum photocatalytic activity of CdS@Ti3C2 composites. The CdS@Ti3C2-15 exhibits the best photocatalytic H2 production activity, which is ascribed to that more light-capture due to good dispersion of CdS NRs on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene, and more photoexcited electron can be generated. In addition, we also tested the H2 production performance of CdS@Ti3C2-15 under different illumination conditions (Fig. 7c and d). There is almost no photocatalytic H2 evolution under NIR illumination, and the visible light H2 evolution performance (23.37 μmol h−1) is far less than that under simulated sunlight (63.53 μmol h−1). For comparison, the photocatalytic performance of CdS@Pt (0.1 wt%) is also explored (Fig. 7e and f), an optimum H2 production rate (29.92 μmol h−1) is obtained, 2.07 times higher than CdS NRs. However, the H2 evolution rate of CdS@Ti3C2-15 (63.53 μmol h−1) is 2.12 times higher than CdS@Pt (0.1 wt%). Therefore, Ti3C2 MXene is a good substitute to noble metal as co-catalysts. From the above, the role of Ti3C2 MXene is significant in photocatalytic H2 production with the good co-catalytic effect. Stability is a vital factor for photocatalysis, we further measure time-dependent H2 production in continuous 36 h test of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite. The amount of produced H2 shows a linear increase with illumination time prolong of each cycle (Fig. S8a). As shown in Fig. S8b, it is found that the H2 evolution rate of the second cycle and the third cycle accounted for 94.95 and 87.61% of the first cycle, respectively, which indicates that the materials we prepared have good cycle stability. For the long-term cycled sample, the XRD, SEM-EDX of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite after the cycle test are shown in Fig. S9-S11 and Table S3. From Fig. S9, it clearly shows that the positions of the main diffraction peaks of CdS (JCPDS No. 41–1049) have no shift, and the intensity of the diffraction peak is slightly weakened due to the consumption of electrons. Besides, the elemental content and distribution of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite after the cycle test (Fig. S10, S11 and Table S3) were also investigated by the SEM-EDX elemental point scan and mapping images, there is no significant changes in elemental content and elemental distribution. The above results clearly show that CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite maintains its original crystal phase, elemental content and distribution, suggesting that CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite present good stability for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Additionally, to further explore the photocatalytic performance and co-catalytic effect of Ti3C2 MXene, we first tested its photocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance and found its no production of ammonia. We also measured the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance of CdS NRs, CdS@Ti3C2 composites and CdS@Pt (0.1 wt%) by using 20 vol% methanol as a sacrificial reagent (Fig. 8 ). NH4 + concentration was determined colorimetry by the Nessler-reagent method. No detectable NH4 + generation is monitored when any of the following three conditions are missing: photocatalyst, light irradiation and N2, suggesting that NH4 + generation reaction is driven by the photocatalytic process. Pure CdS NRs exhibit a low photocatalytic NH4 + production rate of 156.62 μmol L−1h−1 due to their low carrier transfer and separation ability. Among the CdS@Ti3C2 composites, CdS@Ti3C2-15 shows the best nitrogen fixation activity with a rate of 293.06 μmol L−1h−1, higher than that of CdS@Pt (212.54 μmol L−1h−1), indicating that Ti3C2 MXene could substitute and transcend Pt for promoting the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance of CdS. The nitrogen fixation performance shows the same regularity as the hydrogen production performance, which further proves the control over the ratio of Ti3C2 to CdS is essential to optimize the photocatalytic activity of CdS@Ti3C2 composites. The CdS@Ti3C2-15 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance, due to more light-capture and effective utilization of electrons due to the existence of Ti3C2. In addition, in the absence of sacrificial agent, we conducted the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation test on the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, and tested the ammonia content simultaneously by ion chromatography and the Nessler-reagent method. The results showed that the test results of ammonia content are consistent, the rate of nitrogen fixation is 27.28 μmol L−1h−1, which further indicates that the synthesis is ammonia is originated from the photocatalytic reduction of N2. The cycle performance for NH4 + production over CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite is also tested to evaluate its stability. We adjusted the amount of photocatalyst from 20 to 50 mg for the cycle test of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. As shown in Fig. S12, it is found that the NH4 + production rate of the third cycle is about 99.35% of the first cycle. From above, almost 97.94% of the incipient activity is maintained after 6 h testing, which indicates that CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite has good cycle stability with considering the material loss between different cycles. In addition, we also found that the NH4 + production rate is not comparable to that of 20 mg catalyst participates in the reaction, indicating that the quality of the catalyst also affects the reaction process of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. In order to more directly characterize the photocatalytic efficiency, we calculated the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) under simulated sunlight illumination. For photocatalytic hydrogen production, AQE values over the samples: 2.28% (CdS@Ti3C2-15) > 1.93% (CdS@Ti3C2-20) > 1.88% (CdS@Ti3C2-25) > 1.46% (CdS@Ti3C2-10) > 1.13% (CdS@Ti3C2-50) > 1.07% (CdS@Pt) > 1.06% (CdS@Ti3C2-5) > 0.52% (CdS NRs) > 0.45% (CdS@Ti3C2-100), consistent with the photocatalytic H2 evolution. About photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, AQE calculation results are as follows: 7.88% (CdS@Ti3C2-15) > 6.82% (CdS@Ti3C2-20) > 6.54% (CdS@Ti3C2-25) > 6.53% (CdS@Ti3C2-10) > 6.30% (CdS@Ti3C2-5) > 6.01% (CdS@Ti3C2-50) > 5.72% (CdS@Pt) > 5.48% (CdS@Ti3C2-100) > 3.97% (CdS NRs), which is similar to the result of hydrogen production. The calculation results of AQE demonstrate that charge separation efficiency is greatly improved, CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite presents a good photocatalytic performance, further illustrating the co-catalytic effect of Ti3C2 MXene. In addition, we compared photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and ammonia synthesis to previously reported catalysts (Table S4), it is obvious that the photocatalytic performance of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite is excellent compared with the previous reports. In order to better understand the photocatalytic mechanism, we next explored the separation and transfer efficiency of photoexcited carriers, which is crucial to the photocatalytic performance [23,33,45]. In order to understand the role of photogenerated carriers, the Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were investigated (Fig. 9 ). Under the excitation wavelength of 405 nm (Fig. 9a), CdS NRs present a high PL emission intensity owing to the facile carrier recombination on CdS. Three distinct emission peaks at 570, 586 and 598 nm can be observed. The peak at 570 nm is ascribed to near-band-edge emission of CdS [21,58]. And the broad peak at 586 nm is ascribed to the recombination of structural defect states at the surface of the CdS nanocrystals [33,58]. In addition, the broad emission peak at 598 nm is assigned to the band-to-band emission of CdS [21,61]. In contrast, CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite exhibits substantially quenched PL emission peak, which indicates that the enhanced charge separation efficiency through the interface between CdS NRs and Ti3C2 MXene. The time-resolved PL decay spectra of the samples are further measured to comparing the exciton lifetime (Fig. 9b). CdS NRs exhibit fast decay with intensity-average lifetimes of 0.4945 ns. In contrast, the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite has a prolonged intensity-average lifetime of 0.5455 ns. The increased carrier lifetime in CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite is associated with the electrons fast injecting from CdS NRs to Ti3C2 MXene and slowly recovering from Ti3C2 MXene to CdS NRs. The presence of Ti3C2 MXene can enhance the conductivity, improve electron transport efficiency, effectively suppress carrier recombination and prolong carrier lifetime. In addition, in order to explore the reasons for the best performance of the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite and better understand the photocatalytic mechanism, we conducted the Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of CdS and all CdS@Ti3C2 composites (Fig. S13), the corresponding emission peak is consistent with Fig. 9. It can be clearly observed that the PL intensity regular changes of all material are consistent with the regular of photocatalytic performance, CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite with the best photocatalytic performance has the lowest emission intensity. In CdS@Ti3C2 composites materials, the ratio of Ti3C2 and CdS is vital to performance expression, the PL spectrum reflects the difference in carrier recombination rate of CdS@Ti3C2 composites materials with different ratios. The best performance of CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite is attributed to that Ti3C2 most effectively improves the electron transport efficiency, inhibits carrier recombination, and prolongs the carrier life. For further understanding the electron transfer and photocatalytic mechanism, a series of electrochemical tests were carried out. Fig. 10 a shows the Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of CdS NRs, CdS@Ti3C2-15 and Ti3C2 MXene, Ti3C2 MXene show typical metal properties, as previously reported [23,40,41,46]. Compared with CdS (0.27 mA/cm2), the CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite (1.45 mA/cm2) shows a higher current density and a lower over-potential during the entire voltage range, indicating CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite owns fast interfacial electron transfer at its interface [21]. The transient photocurrent responses (PEC) curves of Ti3C2 MXene, CdS NRs, and CdS@Ti3C2 composites are obtained to investigate the charge transfer (Fig. 10b). Remarkably, Ti3C2 MXene also exhibits a photocurrent response due to the electrons are excited by light, attributing to its metallic properties and oxidation-generated titanium dioxide [23,62]. The samples of CdS NRs and CdS@Ti3C2 composites show an instant rise of photocurrent response after the light is on. These vertical rising and falling photocurrents indicate that the charge transport in the photoelectrodes proceeds very fast [26,63]. By comparison, we find that CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite exhibits the highest photocurrent density, and except the CdS@Ti3C2-50 and CdS@Ti3C2-100 composite, the photoresponse current density of CdS@Ti3C2 composites is higher than CdS NRs, the PEC regular of all material is consistent with the regular of photocatalytic performance, which suggests that CdS@Ti3C2 composite realizes a higher carrier transfer and separation efficiency [23,41,43,63]. Moreover, the ratio of Ti3C2 and CdS is vital to the improvement of carrier transfer and separation efficiency, CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite owns the greatest enhancement due to its special micro-morphology, large specific surface area and pore volume, and good light absorption. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful measure for characterizing charge carrier transport properties and separation efficiency. Typically, the charge transfer resistance is reflected by the diameter of each semicircle [59]. As shown in Fig. 10c, CdS NRs and CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite have a smaller radius when the light on, indicating the fast electron transmission of the photoresponse. In addition, we measured the EIS Nyquist plots of Ti3C2 MXene, CdS NRs and CdS@Ti3C2 composites with the light on (Fig. 10d), it is clearly observed that the EIS Nyquist plots arc radius of Ti3C2 MXene (Fig. 10d inset) is the smallest due to its metal properties, and the arc radius of CdS@Ti3C2 composites is smaller than that of CdS NRs, the arc radius of CdS@Ti3C2 composites decreases as the amount of Ti3C2 increases, which is because the metallicity of CdS@Ti3C2 composites is proportional to the Ti3C2 content [28,45]. Especially, only one arc radius can be obtained in the measured frequency ranges, implying that only surface carrier transfer occurs during the photocatalytic process [58,63]. In order to better understand the difference in charge transfer, we have drawn the fitting circuit (Fig. 10d inset) and fitted the charge transfer resistance (Rct), as shown in Table S5. With the content of Ti3C2 increases, the value of Rct decreases, which is consistent with Fig. 10d. In short, the smaller arc radius of CdS@Ti3C2 composites demonstrates that the efficient charge separation and faster charge transportation due to the presence of Ti3C2 MXene, which can be inferred that Ti3C2 MXene as co-catalysts is essential for the rapid transfer of electrons in the photocatalytic process. We conducted the band structure analysis of CdS NRs by Mott-Schottky curve test, as shown in Fig. 11 . In general, the flat-band potential (EFB) can be used to approximately estimate the conduction band (CB) position (ECB) [21]. As shown in Fig. 11, the EFB of CdS NRs is −0.514 V vs. Ag/AgCl (-0.317 V vs. NHE). As previously reported, the ECB of an n-type semiconductor is more negative by 0.14 eV than that its EFB value [25], therefore, the ECB of CdS in CdS NRs could be approximated to −0.457 V vs. NHE. The band structure meets the reduction potential for hydrogen production and nitrogen reduction, which is essential for the expression of photocatalytic performance. In addition, we also studied the energy band structure of Ti3C2 (Fig S14), and found that it has no absorption edge, no band gap width, and the flat pad potential is 0 V vs. NHE, showing its typical metal characteristics. It also can be further explained that Ti3C2 only exists as a co-catalyst in the composite material. Besides, according to the ‘‘band matching’’ theory, the photo-excited electrons from CdS of CdS@Ti3C2 composite would be easier to be injected into the Ti3C2 because of the suitable energy level [1,45,47,48]. From the investigation of the energy band structure, the electron-holes separation/transfer path at the interface of the CdS@Ti3C2 composites during the photocatalytic reaction process was displayed, as shown in Scheme 2 . The photogenerated charge transfer from VB to CB, and further transfer and converged on the surface of Ti3C2 for photocatalytic reduction due to its strongest capacity to accept photo-induced electrons from semiconductor photocatalysts [14,45]. The important role of Ti3C2 in CdS@Ti3C2 can be clearly seen, the more detailed information can be seen in Scheme 3 . Based on the above results, the exciton transfer pathways and charge transfer mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic activities on CdS@Ti3C2 composites and CdS NRs are schematically illustrated in Scheme 3. Typically, as shown in Scheme 3a, when CdS@Ti3C2 composite is irradiated by light, CdS can absorb light, the photogenerated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are produced in CB and VB of CdS, respectively. Subsequently, Ti3C2 owns the strongest capacity to accept photo-induced electrons from semiconductor photocatalysts due to the good electron conductivity, metallic properties, the photoinduced electrons are rapidly migrated from CdS to Ti3C2. After being transferred to Ti3C2, the photo-induced electrons are further rapidly shuttled to its surface due to the excellent metallic conductivity. Finally, thanks to the outstanding co-catalytic capacity of Ti3C2, the protons and N2 in the aqueous solution are efficiently reduced by the photo-induced electrons at active sites on Ti3C2 to evolve H2 and NH3 [14,45,47,48]. Moreover, the intimate interfacial contact between CdS NRs and Ti3C2 MXene can efficiently decrease the migration distance of carriers, facilitating the migration of photogenerated carriers. So, all these positive factors promote the effective carrier transfer and separation in the presence of co-catalysts Ti3C2 MXene, causing remarkably improved photocatalytic performance of CdS@Ti3C2. For CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite, suitable microscopic morphology, appropriate light absorption capacity, relatively larger specific surface area and pore volume, and favorable energy band structure make the optimal performance of Ti3C2′s co-catalytic effect, exhibiting the best photocatalytic hydrogen generation and photocatalytic ammonia synthesis activity. Nevertheless, pure CdS NRs (Scheme 3b) are excited to produce carriers under light illumination. Electrons and holes will be rapidly recombined without co-catalysts, inducing the low photocatalytic activity."
2,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have successfully developed an efficient 1D/2D CdS NWs@Ti3C2 MXene (CdS@Ti3C2) composites photocatalyst by combining co-catalyst strategy and morphology engineering method through assembling CdS NRs on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene. With this design, photoexcited carriers are efficiently transferred and separated. The obtained CdS@Ti3C2-15 composite with the Ti3C2 adding amount of 15 mg exhibits higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activity (63.53 μmol h−1) and good photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity (293.06 μmol L−1h−1). The photocatalytic ammonia synthesis activity of CdS@Ti3C2 composites is reported for the first time, and the composite also displays good stability. In the CdS@Ti3C2 system, the introduction of Ti3C2 MXene as co-catalysts can play multiple positive roles in the photocatalytic reduction process. This work offers an innovative strategy to explore non-noble metal co-catalysts with low cost and long-term durability for the renewable energy future."
