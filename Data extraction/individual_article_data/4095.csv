0,Introduction,"Energy guarantees the prerequisites for human development. All the achievements of human society are based on the massive use of fossil fuels such as fuel coal, oil and natural gas [1]. However, even ignoring the environmental pollution caused by these fossil fuels, its reserves are rapidly decreasing and non-renewable [2]. This situation still greatly affects human life. Therefore, exploring and developing new alternative energy sources has become a topic of the world, and the renewable energy is a research hotspot. Hydrogen (H2) receives much attention because of its clean and renewable, non-polluting, and abundant earth reserves [3–6]. Water electrolysis in the room temperature is a traditional method of producing high-clean hydrogen. However, due to the high power consumption, the current production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is limited to a great extent [7,8]. Therefore, the research focus of hydrogen production in water electrolysis is mainly on how to reduce the consumption. It is an effective method to design rational catalysts further reducing the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction [9–16]. However, the best commercial catalysts are still the platinum (Pt) based materials, which are expensive and scarce, seriously hindering the large-scale production of electrolytic water splitting [17–20]. Thus, searching and designing the cheap, abundant, and effective electrocatalysts is a crucial subject. Recently, the transition metal based materials (such as sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides and so on) receive much attention [12,21–26]. Molybdenum carbon (Mo2C) was gradually getting attention among the abundant catalysts. The C atoms are intercalated into the crystal lattice of the metal Mo to form molybdenum carbide. The Mo2C is similar to noble metal catalysts in many respects. For example, it is comparable to precious metals such as Pt and rhodium (Rh) in the catalytic activity of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions. In addition, the Mo2C has lower prices than noble metals and excellent sulfur toxicity resistance properties and can be regarded as perfect substitutes for precious metals [27–29]. Therefore, these advantages make it have broad application prospects in the field of catalysis, including electrocatalytic HER. For example, Xia et al. developed a MOFs-assisted strategy to prepare the porous MoCx nano-octahedrons for efficient HER, requiring an overpotentials of 142 mV to obtain 10 mA cm−2 [30]. Chen et al. reported that the ultrafine β-Mo2C nanoparticles on graphene substrate using the Mo-based polyoxomolybdate, showing a good HER performance [31]. Very recently, Xu et al. developed β-Mo2C nanoparticles grown on N-doped carbon nanotubes employed the polyaniline as the carbon source, which shows a good HER activity in acidic condition, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1 [32]. However, even the researchers struggle to find the most economically carbon sources for the synthesis of molybdenum carbon, there is still much space for the optimization of material selection and catalysts designing. For example, there are kinds of waste biomass containing abundant carbon sources (such as willow catkin, walnut shell, spathe-pollen of palm, and so on), which can be applied in the preparation of the molybdenum carbon catalysts [33,34]. In this work, the waste walnut shell powder was used as the carbon source, and ammonium heptamolybdate was used as the molybdenum source. The porous β-Mo2C nanoparticle clusters supported on carbon matrix were prepared by the calcination method under the argon gas flow of the activated walnut shell-ammonium heptamolybdate hybrid powder mixture. The best conditions for the experiment were found at the temperature of 1173 K while the mass ratios of ammonium heptamolybdate and walnut shell powder are 1:2 (Mo2C@C-1:2). The open pores in the Mo2C nanoparticle clusters can facilitate electrolyte permeation and hydrogen molecules release, and the carbon matrix can enhance the electric conductivity of the catalyst. As a consequence, the Mo2C@C-1:2 exhibits an efficient HER performance, with an overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1. In addition, the catalyst behaves excellent electrochemical stability performance during long-term electrochemical tests, making it possible for industrial application."

3,Synthesis of activated walnut shell powder,"2.2 Synthesis of activated walnut shell powder First, weigh 10 g of walnut shell powder and place it in an oven at 120 °C for 2 h to remove water, and then add 50% phosphoric acid, mixing the walnut shell powder with the phosphoric acid solution at a mass ratio of 1:4, and stirring for 24 h at room temperature. After that, extracting the phosphoric acid solution of the impregnated walnut shell powder by a vacuum suction device, and continuously washing the filtered product with deionized water until the pH is close to 7.0, and then separating the walnut shell powder. The obtained walnut shell powder was placed in a drying oven at 120 °C for 6 h to obtain the activated walnut shell powder, which was reserved."

After stirring for 6 h, the suspension was placed in an oven at 60° C until the alcohol is completely evaporated. The hybrid powder obtained after drying was ground in a mortar so that the two substances are more uniformly mixed."
5,Synthesis of the porous Mo2C@C powder and the Mo2C@C electrode,"2.4 Synthesis of the porous Mo2C@C powder and the Mo2C@C electrode The ammonium heptamolybdate and activated walnut shell hybrid powder with different mass ratios were prepared and calcined at different temperatures to determine the optimum process parameters for the preparation of Mo2C@C. The mass ratio of ammonium heptamolybdate to activated walnut shell powder was 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, and 1:5 (the mass was 0.5 g: 0.5 g, 0.5 g: 1 g, 1 g: 0.5 g, and 0.5 g: 2.5 g, respectively). First, the hybrid powder was placed in a high temperature tube furnace at 1173 K (heating rate 5 °C/min), and kept the temperature for 4 h, and then cool naturally to room temperature. Then the product was centrifuged three times with distilled water and absolute alcohol, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain the Mo2C@C powder. For the synthesis of the Mo2C@C electrode, the carbon cloth (CC) was employed as the current collector. 2 mg Mo2C@C powder was dispersed in a mixture solution of 5% Nafion (32 μL), anhydrous alcohol (0.5 mL) and deionized water (0.5 mL) under ultrasonic dispersion for 40 min to obtain the slurry. The slurry was dropped on the surface of CC."
6,Characterizations,"2.5 Characterizations The scanning electron microscope with energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM-EDS, JEOL JSM-6480) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Teccai G2 S-Twin, Philips) were employed to examine the morphologies of the samples.

The surface chemical states of Mo2C@C-1:2 was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250) using Al Kα radiation. The Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer was employed to conduct Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms."

The working electrode was the catalyst, the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode, and the counter electrode was a carbon rod. The electrolyte was 0.5 M H2SO4 or 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were accomplished in the frequency range of 105 Hz to 0.01 Hz at a potential that can drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2. All the LSV and CA curves measured were IR-corrected. All potentials vs. RHE are obtained by the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.0592 * pH."
8,Results and discussion,"The walnut shell powder was obtained from the waste walnut shell like the inset in Fig. 1 a. The powder was activated by phosphoric acid before using. The Mo2C@C catalyst was prepared by the calcination method under the argon gas flow of the activated walnut shell-ammonium heptamolybdate hybrid powder mixture as shown in Fig. 1a. XRD was conducted to prove the crystal characteristics of the Mo2C@C-1:2. As shown in Fig. 1b, the XRD curve correspond to the product obtained when the mass ratios of ammonium heptamolybdate and walnut shell powder is 1:2 at the temperature of 1173 K. The peaks of this catalyst are perfectly matched with the β-Mo2C card of PDF#65-8766. The peaks at 34.53°, 38.04°, 39.58°, 52.31°, 61.87°, 69.76°, 72.82°, 74.98°, 75.98°, 81.36° and 85.24° are corresponding to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2), (2 0 1), (0 0 4) and (2 0 2) crystal faces, respectively. Also, the peak at 26.6° is consistent with the characteristic peak of hexagonal graphite [35]. We have calculated the average grain size of Mo2C nanoparticles by Scherrer equation based on the XRD, and the result is 80.45 nm. Fig. 1c indicates the XPS spectrum and fitting curve of Mo 3d of the Mo2C@C-1:2. Two peaks at 228.4 eV and 231.6 eV can be attributed to C-Mo (corresponding to Mo 2d5/2 and Mo 2d3/2, respectively). The peaks located at 229.2 and 232.5 eV are belong to Mo4+, which correspond to Mo 2d5/2 and Mo 2d3/2, respectively. In addition, the peaks at 233.1 and 235.8 eV are attributed to the presence of Mo6+. The high valences of + 4 and + 6 can be caused by the air contact [32,36,37]. Fig. 1d indicates the XPS spectrum and fitting curve of C 1 s. Three peaks of 280.8, 284.5, and 285.5 eV can be fitted, which correspond to the CMo, the typical carbon atom peak, and the CO bond, respectively. The formation of CO can be due to the surface oxidation the Mo2C@C-1:2 exposed in air [38–40]. Generally, the pericarp of the plants contains less hetero atom nitrogen than sarcocarp, and the walnut shell powder we adopt coming from the pericarp, which may contain a very small number of heteroatom of nitrogen. But there wasn’t obvious evidence showing that the carbon was doped by heteroatoms, which can be caused by volatilization during the calcination at high temperature of 1173 K. Fig. S1 shows the Mo2C@C catalysts are in the form of nanoparticles without regular morphology. To explore the uniformity of the Mo2C@C, the EDS mapping was employed as shown in Fig. 1f and g according to the low magnification SEM image (Fig. 1e), and it can be observed the elementals of C and Mo are distributed uniformly. In addition, the EDS spectrum indicates the obvious peaks of Mo and C elementals as shown in Fig. S2. The specific surface area of Mo2C@C-1:2 was measured, and the walnut shell powder treated with phosphoric acid as a comparison via nitrogen adsorption-desorption. Fig. 2 a shows two nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms curves, according to the Brunauer classification method, the curves shown in the figure all conform to the standard IV curve [41,42]. The specific surface area of the Mo2C@C-1:2 and the walnut shell powder is about 56.496 and 5.873 m2 g−1, respectively. The specific surface area after the calcination reaction is increased by nearly 9 times, which confirms that the Mo2C catalyst offers more active sites for the HER process. We also added the corresponding the pore size distribution diagram of the Mo2C@C-1:2 as shown in Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the pore sizes are concentrated in 4–12 nm and 50–200 nm, which indicates the catalyst includes rich mesopores and macrospores. Fig. 2c shows the TEM image of the Mo2C@C catalysts. It can be observed that Mo2C mainly exists in the form of particles, and the particles are connected with each other, forming nanoparticle clusters. There are rich macrospores remarked by the white dotted line, in accord with Fig. 2b. Though the Mo2C nanoparticles reunited into the clusters, Fig. 2d furtherly indicates the size of the particles is about dozens of nanometers as shown in the yellow dotted area as well as Fig. S3, which consistent with the Scherrer analysis. The edges are the carbon matrix, which can enhance the electroconductivity of the catalyst. In addition, the nanoparticle clusters are rich in pores, which can be beneficial to releasing H2 molecules. By making a high-resolution lattice phase on the selected regions, we gain a deeper understanding of the structure of the prepared product from Fig. 2e. It can be clearly seen the lattice fringes, and the average spacing of the lattice fringes is 0.118 nm, corresponding to the (0 0 4) crystal plane of β-Mo2C. We can also observe the mesopores as the white dotted line marked, which is in keeping with Fig. 2b. Furthermore, the lattice spacing of 0.22 nm can be observed in Fig. 2f, which agrees with the (1 0 1) crystal plane of β-Mo2C. Then the HER performance of the as-prepared catalysts was explored in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a sweep rate of 2 mV s−1 (the small sweep speed is used to minimize the effect of capacitor current). Fig. 3 a shows the performance comparison of walnut shell powder and ammonium heptamolybdate at different mass ratios. As a comparison, a simple carbon cloth (CC) was used as an electrode, and the performance of the carbon cloth is negligible as exhibited. The catalyst prepared at a mass ratio of 1:2 has the best performance, and the corresponding overpotential is about 140 mV at a current of 10 mA cm−2. Secondly, the performance at a mass ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 perform the overpotentials of 176 mV and 184 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. The mass ratio of 1:5 is relatively poor, and the overpotential at a current of 10 mA cm−2 is 280 mV. The histogram in Fig. 3b further shows the Mo2C@C-1:2 needs a smallest overpotential of 165 mV to drive a current density of 20 mA cm−2 (208, 225, and 334 mV for Mo2C@C-1:1, Mo2C@C-2:1 and Mo2C@C-1:5). In addition, the Mo2C@C-1:2 can obtain a current density of 34 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 200 mV, much larger than that of Mo2C@C-1:1 (17.5 mA cm−2), Mo2C@C-2:1 (13 mA cm−2), and Mo2C@C-1:5 (2.0 mA cm−2). All the above analysis suggests that different ratios have a certain degree of influence on the HER performance. This can be due to the synergistic effect between the carbon and Mo2C, and the optimal carbon matrix can help the Mo2C catalyze the HER process. Fig. 3d shows the Tafel slope plot for the catalysts at different ratios. The slopes of CC, Mo2C@C-1:2, Mo2C@C-1:1, Mo2C@C-2:1, and Mo2C@C-1:5 are 192, 63, 95, 100, and 159 mV dec-1, respectively. The slope corresponding to the Mo2C@C-1:2 is also the smallest, indicating the HER on this sample performs the best kinetics. We have also compared the Mo2C@C-1:2 catalyst with the catalysts reported previously as the Table S1 shows. It indicates that the Mo2C@C-1:2 hybrid electrocatalysts behave better for HER than the Mo2C reported lately, and even competitive with the recently proposed hybrid materials as shown in Fig. 3e and Table S1. The Mo2C particle clusters combined conductive carbon matrix can be available for achieving fast electron transport as well as a high intrinsic activity, which can be difficult available with the only Mo2C particle clusters or other conventional catalysts. Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram for better understanding the HER kinetics on the surface of Mo2C@C-1:2 catalyst. Based on the previous research, the Tafel slopes for the Volmer, Tafel, and Heyrovsky steps are 118, 29, and 39 mV dec-1, respectively [58], from which we can judge that the control step of the HER on the Mo2C@C-1:2 (63 mV dec-1) catalyst should be the Volmer-Heyrovsky or Volmer-Tafel mechanism in the acidic condition. The two-step reaction process can be shown in Fig. 4, and the first step is electrochemical adsorption of hydrogen. The hydronium ion (H3O+) gain an electron from the catalytic electrode, and a reduction reaction takes place to generate hydrogen atoms ( *H ) on the surface of the electrode, which is the Volmer step. The second step is desorption, which can be electrochemical desorption or the chemical desorption. Desorption process can take place when two *H atoms directly combine into one H2 molecule, and this is the Volmer-Tafel mechanism. For another way, the generated *H binds to another H3O+ and then receives an electron from the catalyst surface to form one molecule of H2, and this is the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Given the Tafel slope is 63 mV dec-1, the HER process on the surface of Mo2C@C-1:2 tends to be Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, and the Volmer-Tafel may take place in the meantime [43,52]. During the reaction, the walnut shell powders derived carbon matrix can effectively transfer the electrons and help to enhance the conductivity, furtherly accelerating the HER process. In addition, EIS was employed as shown in Fig. S4. It can be obtained that the value of Rct (the charge transfer) for the Mo2C@C-1:2 is about 1.5 Ω, much smaller than that of the bare CC. We have also tried to explore the electrocatalytic performance of the Mo2C@C-1:2 in the alkaline condition (1 M KOH) as exhibited in Fig. S5. It needs an overpotential of 227 mV of the catalyst Mo2C@C-1:2 to obtain 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 142 mV dec-1, and the EIS (Fig. S4) shows the Rct is about 2.5 Ω, suggesting that the catalyst behaves a better performance in the acidic condition. The stability is an important factor for the industrial application of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. S7, it can be seen that the two curves are almost completely coincident before and after testing 1000 CV cycles (CVs) from 0 to −0.6 V vs. RHE at the scan rete of 100 mV s−1. Even after 1000 CVs as exhibited in Fig. 5 a, the polarization curve shows the Mo2C@C-1:2 catalyst has a similar performance with that before CVs. The detail comparison of the overpotential before and after CVs is listed in Table S2, suggesting the durability is good. Furtherly, the chronopotentiometry was applied to measure the stability of the catalyst. As shown in the Fig. 5b, different current densities of 10, 30, 50 and 10 mA cm−2 were applied for 9000 s in turn. It can be seen that in the first stage, the overpotential gradually stabilizes at around 125 mV from the beginning of 150 mV; in the second stage, the overpotential is basically stable between 193 mV and 200 mV without large fluctuations; in the third stage, the overpotential is stable between 230 mV and 236 mV; in the final stage, the current density returns to 10 mA and the overpotential is stable at around 120 mV, which is very close to the first stage. Furthermore, the chronoamperometry was employed to investigate the stability. Fig. 5c shows the curve at the overpotential of 140 mV for 10 h, which indicates that the curve is very stable, and the current density is basically maintained at about 8.7 mA cm−2. Fig. S8 is taken from 10,000 s to 20,000 s of Fig. 5c, which is drawn to amplify the subtle changes in current during the test. Though the current density has some changes, the whole process is stable, indicating that good stability."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the porous Mo2C nanoparticle clusters supported on carbon matrix was developed by the calcination method employed the waste walnut shell as the carbon source, and ammonium heptamolybdate as the molybdenum source. The preparation method is simple and easy to repeat. This strategy can change waste material into things of value. The walnut shell powders derived carbon matrix can effectively prevent the Mo2C particles from agglomeration and enhance the electron transfer between catalysts and the electrolyte. The open pores in the optimal Mo2C@C-1:2 can facilitate electrolyte permeation and hydrogen molecules release, avoiding the active sites occupied by the produced H2 gas. As a result, the Mo2C@C-1:2 exhibits an efficient HER performance as well as excellent electrochemical stability. The rational catalysts we designed can be applied in a broad area such as energy storage and sensors. The strategy changing waste walnut shell into the effective catalysts sets an example for the cost-effective materials designing."
