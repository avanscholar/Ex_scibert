0,Introduction,"The global energy consumption is increasing at an enormous rate compared to the population growth (International Energy Outlook, 2003). Fossil fuel is one of the major energy resources being widely used to meet our energy requirements. These resources are depleting fast and also, these are the major source of global warming (Wigley, 1991; Hoel and Kverndokk, 1996). Various alternative fuels such as hydrogen, ethanol and biodiesel (eg: methyl esters) are being exploited currently to sustain the energy requirement. Biodiesel has high potential as liquid transportation fuel because of its environmental benefits such as minimal emission of CO2 when compared to regular diesel fuel (National Biodiesel Board, 2004). Biodiesel is produced from vegetable sources (soybean, sunflower, canola, cotton seed, rapeseed and palm oil) and animal fats using the processes such as micro emulsions, thermal cracking (pyrolysis) and transesterification (Ma and Hanna, 1999). Of the several methods available for producing biodiesel, transesterification of oils and fats is the most common method. This is because of biodiesel from other methods affects the engine performance by producing carbon. Transesterification is the reaction of fat or oil with an alcohol to form esters known as biodiesel and glycerol using a catalyst (Boocock et al., 1996; Dalai et al., 2000; Demirbas, 2002a; Filliers et al., 1995; Shah et al., 2004; Sridharan and Mathai, 1974). For example, in transesterification of canola oil with methonal, 90wt% of methyl esters (biodiesel) was obtained and the remain was by-product gylcerol (Lang et al., 2001). The federal government of Canada has planned to produce 500 million litres of biodiesel per year by the year 2010 to meet the Kyoto protocol (Smith, 2004). This would lead to 55.4 million litres of glycerol/year in the Canadian market. The glycerol markets are limited; increase in biodiesel production may cause glycerol sales price to decline (Prakash, 1998; Tyson, 2003). The money invested in purifying the glycerol also would be high. In addition, Tyson (2003) reported that biodiesel production cost can be reduced from US$0.63/L to US$0.38/L by adding the value to the glycerol. Glycerol is a potential feedstock to produce H2 because 1mol of glycerol can theoretically produce up to 4mol of hydrogen. H2 is mostly used in refinery hydrotreating operations, for ammonia production and in fuel cells, (Rapagna et al., 1998). When glycerol is gasified at high temperature to produce hydrogen, it is possible to get CO as one of the gaseous products. Formation of syn gas (H2 +CO) in the ratio H2/CO equal to 2:1 could be used as a feedstock in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce green diesel (long chain hydrocarbon) (Chaudhari et al., 2001; Steynberg and Nel, 2004). Alternatively, gases which are produced from glycerol would have medium heating value and can be used as a fuel gas to produce electricity. Glycerol also can be a potential feedstock for the production of 1,3-propanediol, polyglycerols and polyurethanes (Claude, 1999). Attempts were made earlier in our laboratory to convert glycerol to syn gas (Chaudhari and Bhakshi, 2002). They reported that during pyrolysis process, glycerol was converted completely to gas and char at 700°C. Also, they reported that by steam gasification, 80wt% of glycerol was converted to gas and produced 92.3mol% of syn gas with H2/CO ratio of 2 at 700°C and 10g/h of steam flow rate. Steam gasification of glycerol was studied in a laminar flow reactor to produce liquid products (Stein et al., 1983). They reported that at a lower temperature and shorter residence time, acrolein and acetaldehyde were the major liquid products. As the temperature increased, syn gas was the major gaseous products. This result was in contrast with those obtained by Chaudhari and Bhakshi (2002), who reported that steam gasification process produced no liquid products at 700°C. Glycerol was decomposed into major products such as methanol, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acrolein, allyl alcohol, ethanol, formaldehyde, CO, CO2 and H2 using supercritical water with and without catalyst (Buhler et al., 2002; Xu et al., 1996). Literature indicates that no systematic studies have been carried out to study the effects of temperature, flow rate of inert gas and packing materials in a packed bed on the pyrolysis of glycerol to gaseous fuel. The objective in this work was to investigate the process conditions in a fixed-bed reactor that would give the maximum yield of product gas and H2 or syn gas. The N2 flow rate and reaction temperature were varied in the range of 30–70mL/min and 650–800°C, respectively. The packed bed consists of quartz, silicon carbide or Ottawa sand particles with a packing height of 70mm."
1,Experimental,"Pyrolysis of glycerol was carried out in a continuous down-flow fixed-bed micro reactor at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1 ). The reactor was 500mm long with 10.5mm internal diameter made of Inconel® alloy tube and was filled with desired particle diameter of the packing material. Packing materials such as quartz, silicon carbide and sand were used in order to have a plug flow and even distribution of the reactant inside the reactor. Packing material was held on a plug of quartz wool, which was placed on a supporting mesh at the center of reactor. Reactor packing height was 70mm. The feed inlet tube was placed 40mm above the packing bed. This reactor configuration facilitates the reactant to flow as finer droplets because of the carrier gas flow (nitrogen) and the temperature. Carrier gas was used to facilitate the uniform distribution of reactant on the reactor packing. The carrier gas flows downwards from the top of the reactor at a desired flow rate before the reactor was heated to a desired temperature. The flow rate of carrier gas was adjusted with a needle valve and was controlled using a mass flow meter (Sierra Instruments Inc, Monterey, California, USA). Calibration of this mass flow meter was made using a calibrated bubble flow meter and was converted to the flow rates at standard temperature and pressure (STP). Temperature was measured and controlled using K-type thermocouple placed at the heating zone in the furnace and connected to temperature controller (Shimaden SR22, Tokyo, Japan). Another K-type thermocouple was placed inside the bed using thermowell to measure the bed temperature. The temperature measured inside the reactor coincided with the operating temperature. The desired temperature of the reactor was reached in 45 to 75min. Glycerol (purity 99%) was pumped into the reactor using a LDC analytical pump (Rayonics Scientific Inc, Ontario, Canada) at the rate of 5.4g/h. The LDC analytical pump was calibrated in the range of 2–8g/h. Based on earlier studies (Chaudhari and Bhakshi, 2002) preliminary runs on pyrolysis of glycerol were done and it was observed that at 700°C with the carrier gas flow rate of 50mL/min in a packed bed reactor 70mol% of syn gas was produced. Since the objective of our research was to maximize yield of syn gas or H2, the process conditions were studied over the ranges including these values. For example, the carrier gas flow rate was varied in the range of 30–70mL/min and temperature in the range of 650–800°C."
2,A typical run,"2.1 A typical run The reactor was cleaned, dried, weighed with the packing material and mounted inside the furnace. Nitrogen was allowed to flow at the desired flow rate while heating the reactor to the desired temperature. Glycerol was fed at 5.4g/h at the desired reactor temperature and flow rate for 30min. The product leaving the reactor was condensed and separated into liquid and gaseous fractions. The liquid product fraction was collected in a liquid trap, cooled with ice-salt bath and the gaseous product was collected over a saturated brine solution of sodium chloride. At the end of the reaction, the flow of nitrogen was maintained for 2min to flush the entire product inside the reactor. The reactor was then cooled and weighed to determine the amount of char. A Hewlett Packard (HP) 5890 gas chromatograph (GC) with the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) having Carbosive S II column (3m, i.d. 3.18mm) was used to analyze H2, CO and CO2. Helium gas was used as a carrier gas. Hydrocarbons such as CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and C3+ were analyzed using a HP 5880GC, equipped with the flame ionization detector (FID) having Chromsorb 102 Column (1.8m, i.d. 3.18mm). Helium gas was used as a carrier gas in this GC."
3,Results and discussion,"A number of experiments were repeated to check the reproducibility (Table 1 ). It was observed that the standard deviations were below one and the percentages of errors in most cases were also below ±5% with 95% confidence. The overall material balance for all the experiments was in the range of 90–95wt% (Valliyappan, 2004). The effects of carrier gas flow rate, temperature and particle diameter of packing materials on the pyrolysis of glycerol are discussed below."
4,Effects of carrier gas flow rate,"3.1 Effects of carrier gas flow rate The effect of carrier gas flow rate on product yield during pyrolysis of glycerol is shown in Fig. 2 . With increase in the carrier gas flow rate from 30 to 70mL/min, the yield of gas and char decreased with simultaneous increase in liquid yield. The residence time decreased from 4.1 to 1.8s with increase in gas flow rate and consequently the glycerol had less time for its conversion to gas and char giving higher yield of liquid. The main products in gas were H2 and CO and small amounts of CO2, CH4 and C2H4 (Table 2 ). The pyrolysis of glycerol involves the parallel reactions to produce H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4 and coke as shown in Eq. (1) (Wang et al., 1996) (1) C m H n O k →C x H y O z +gas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, …)+Coke. The effect of carrier gas flow rate on product gas composition is shown in Table 2 and the effect was not significant in the lower flow range. At higher flow of 70mL/min, H2 production decreased and CO production increased along with slight increase in hydrocarbon production suggesting that CO and hydrocarbons are primary pyrolysis products. The formation of syn gas remained almost constant with H2/CO ratio ranging from 0.74 to 1.09 over the flow range of 30–70mL/min. The effects of carrier gas flow rate on volume of product gas and calorific value are shown in Fig. 3 . As expected, with increase in flow rate from 30 to 70mL/min, the volume of the product gas produced (L/per g of glycerol fed) decreased. At higher flow rates the increase in calorific value was because of increase in hydrocarbon production. It may be noted that, calorific value of CH4 (37MJ/m3) is much higher than those of H2 (12MJ/m3) and CO (11.7MJ/m3). Carrier gas flow rates did not have significant effect on the production of syn gas. Carrier gas flow rate of 50mL/min was chosen for further studies based on the high volume of product gas and syn gas produced and low char yield."
5,Effects of temperature,"3.2 Effects of temperature The effect of temperature on product yield during pyrolysis of glycerol with carrier gas flow of 50mL/min is shown in Fig. 4 . With increase in temperature from 650 to 800°C, the gas and char yields increased significantly with simultaneous decrease in the amount of liquid product. This was due to the higher thermal cracking of reactant at higher temperature. The effect of temperature on gas product composition during pyrolysis of glycerol is given in Table 3 . It can be observed that production of H2 changed from 17 to 48.6mol% whereas that of CO reduced from 54.0 to 44.9mol% with increase in temperature from 650 to 800°C. However, CH4 and C2H4 production were almost constant in the temperature range of 650–750°C. But at 800°C, a sudden significant decrease in yield of CH4 and C2H4, from 14 to 3.3mol% and from 10 to 2mol% respectively, was observed. As temperature increased from 650 to 750°C, the yield of H2 only increased with temperature and those of all other compounds decreased, due to the cracking of glycerol to H2 and low boiling hydrocarbons. This is evident from Table 3 that syn gas yield increased slightly from 71 to 73.4mol% when the temperature changed from 650 to 750°C. At 800°C, sudden increase in H2 may have been due to decomposition of CH4 and C2H4 to coke and H2 (Eq. (2)) (Goswami, 2004; Bradford and Vannice, 1999; Ferdous, 2000). This also explains the significant decrease in CH4 and C2H4 yield at 800°C. This led to a large amount of syn gas production of 93.5mol% at 800°C (2) C x H y ↔ mH2 + nC(s). The effects of temperature on volume and calorific value of gas produced are shown in Fig. 5 . There was an increase in volume of gas from 0.4 to 1.17L/g of glycerol with rise in temperature from 650°C to 800°C. However, the calorific value of product gas decreased only slightly over the range 650–750°C with a sudden decrease at 800°C, caused by the decrease in hydrocarbon concentration and large amount of syn gas production. This study indicates that pyrolysis of glycerol at high temperature of 800°C resulted in maximum yield of H2 and syn gas. We were unable to exceed 800°C due to the limitation of furnace. The operating temperature of 800°C was therefore, further used to study the effects of particle diameter of the packing material in the pyrolysis of glycerol process."
6,Effects of particle diameter and packing material,"3.3 Effects of particle diameter and packing material To study the effect of type of packing materials and particle diameters, pyrolysis of glycerol was carried out at 800°C with N2 flow rate of 50mL/min using different packing materials (quartz, silicon carbide and sand). The particle diameter of the packing materials was varied in the range of 0.15–4mm. The effects of particle diameter of different packing materials on yield and composition of gas products are shown in Table 4 and Figs. 6–8 . From Table 4 it can be observed that for all the packing materials, decrease in particle diameter resulted in increase in the yield of gaseous products and char with simultaneous decrease in yield of liquid products. Smaller particle diameter of the packing materials enhanced the plug flow behaviour in the reactor as well as heat transfer and thereby increasing liquid conversion to gas and char. The composition of the gaseous products was also affected by the changing particle diameter for all types of packing materials (Figs. 6–8). However, the nature of change in product composition with particle diameter differed for different materials. For quartz particles, yield of H2 was higher and yield of hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) was lower compared to other packing materials for same particle diameter range. For the particle diameter range of 0.21–0.35mm, pyrolysis of glycerol at 800°C and 50mL/min gas flow, produced 2.33molH2/mol of glycerol fed, which is 58% of the theoretical yield assuming 1mol of glycerol would be converted into 4mol of hydrogen and 3mol of CO. Higher yield of H2 suggests that cracking of hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) to H2 and char, as shown in reaction (2), is favoured in presence of quartz particles. Higher yield of char in case of quartz particles also agrees with this assumption. Furthermore, with smaller particle diameter, the production of H2 was enhanced whereas CO production reduced suggesting that both cracking of hydrocarbons (reaction (2)) and water gas shift reaction of CO (reaction (3)) (Demirbas, 2002b) are favoured at lower diameter for quartz particles resulting in higher yield of H2. Therefore, the reduction in particle diameter did not have significant effect on syn gas concentration (Fig. 6) (3) CO+H2O↔H2 +CO2. On other hand, for smaller silicon carbide particles, both H2 and CO production increased whereas yield of hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) decreased suggesting that H2 and CO are produced by thermal cracking (reaction (2)) as well as steam reforming of hydrocarbons (reaction (4)) (Moenne et al., 2004; Specht et al., 2000 and Cipriani et al., 1998). Increase in yield of char with decrease in diameter also agrees with it (4) CH4 +H2O↔3H2 +CO. However, in case of smaller sand particles, increase in H2 production can be attributed only to the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons to H2 and char (reaction (2)) as reflected in reduced hydrocarbon yield and enhanced char yield. The production of CO was not affected by change in diameter for sand particles. For quartz particles, the particle diameter did not have a significant effect on calorific value of product gas (Table 4) because there was no significant change in the production of hydrocarbons. However, for smaller silicon carbide and sand particles, calorific value of product gas were lower which can be attributed to the decreases in hydrocarbon yield. The effect of particle diameters of the packing material on the product yield and compositions might be attributed to change in porosity and permeability of the bed packing. With decrease in diameter, porosity and permeability of the packing bed decreased for all the packing materials suggesting better packing and hence higher extent of reactions. It is possible to maximise the volume of product gas and syn gas production during pyrolysis of glycerol by packing the reactor with smaller particles in case of all the packing materials (see Table 5 ). The thermal conductivities of the used packing materials also varied. At 800°C, thermal conductivities of quartz, silicon carbide and sand are 5W/mK (Yoon et al., 2004), 25W/mK and 1.7W/mK (Shackelford et al., 1994), respectively. This variation in thermal conductivities may also have contributed to different yield and composition of products with different packing materials."
7,Reaction pathways during the pyrolysis of glycerol,"3.4 Reaction pathways during the pyrolysis of glycerol A number of reactions take place during the pyrolysis of glycerol over the temperature range between 650°C and 800°C. Fig. 9 shows the different reaction pathways for the pyrolysis of glycerol. The components found from the analysis of reaction products were H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, methanol, acrolein, ethanol, water and char. Concurrent reactions, consecutive reactions, dehydration reactions and cracking reactions all compete to transform glycerol into hydrogen, syn gas and char. Reactions (1)–(3) are concurrent and the dehydration reaction led to the formation products such as liquid, gas and char at low temperatures. At high temperature, consecutive and thermal cracking reactions (reaction paths 4, 5 and 6) were predominant to form H2, CO and char. However, under all reaction conditions of pyrolysis of glycerol, total char production was below 10wt%, thereby making the process quite feasible."
8,Conclusions,"In comparison to carrier gas flow rate, change in temperature had significant effects on product gas yield, gas composition, volume of product gas and calorific value. Glycerol (72wt%) was converted to gaseous product containing 93.5mol% syn gas with H2/CO of 1.05 at 800°C, carrier gas flow rate of 50mL/min and quartz diameter of 3–4mm. The gas production was favoured at lower particle size of the packing materials. The volume of the product gas was 1.32L/g of glycerol containing 92.3mol% syn gas (H2/CO of 1.5) when quartz particle diameter of 0.21–0.35mm used as a reactor packing material at 800°C and 50mL/min. At this condition, the H2 produced from pyrolysis of glycerol was 2.33mol/mol of glycerol fed, which was 58% of the theoretical conversion of glycerol to H2. Change in particle diameter of quartz did not have a significant effect on syn gas composition. However, change in packing material had a significant effect on product yield, composition, volume and calorific value of product gas. Heating value of product gas was high at relatively low temperature of 650°C in all flow rates of carrier gas and packing material of different sizes."
