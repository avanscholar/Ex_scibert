0,Introduction,"Microalgae include all unicellular and multicellular photosynthetic microorganisms that live in freshwater and marine environments; therefore, they convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds and generate oxygen. These types of microalgae include cyanobacteria (Chloroxybacteria), green algae (Chlorophyta), red algae (Rhodophyta) and diatoms (Bacillariophyta) [1]. Microalgal biomass is a potential source for gaseous biofuel recovery (hydrogen and methane). However, the cell wall of some microalgal species, for instance, Scenedesmus, contains complex carbohydrates of low biodegradability and bioavailability [2]. These resilient cell walls hinder the digestion process because the organic matter retained in the cytoplasm is not available to the anaerobic microorganisms [2]. On average, the cell wall of microalgae is composed of 25–30% cellulose, 15–25% hemicellulose, 35% pectin and 5–10% glycoproteins [3]. In addition, some microalgae (Nannochloropsis and Scenedesmus) present an outer layer of sporopollenins and algaenans, which are compounds resistant to chemical and enzymatic attack [3]. Therefore, to increase the digestibility of the cell wall, a pretreatment is necessary. Such pretreatment can be thermochemical, mechanical or biological. Thermochemical pretreatments have shown high efficiencies but have the disadvantage of generating inhibitory chemical compounds [4]. Mechanical pretreatments have been widely used, demonstrating that their efficiency is independent of the characteristics of the microalgae under study. However, the energy expended during pretreatment is not compensated by the energy recovered as methane, for example [5]. In this sense, biological pretreatments have generated great interest, because they can be performed under mild reaction conditions, there is no formation of inhibitory compounds, and they have a low energy demand (a crucial factor for scaling up). Enzymatic hydrolysis considerably improves yields and is an alternative to the aforementioned pretreatments; nevertheless, the high costs and need to continuously supply the enzyme (there is no enzyme reuse) limits its application on an industrial scale [6]. Recently, Carrillo-Reyes et al. [7] suggested the use of natural hydrolytic cultures, such as those found in the digestive tract of termites and rumen of ruminants, to digest cell walls of microalgae. The rumen is an anaerobic ecosystem where bacteria, protozoa and fungi degrade lignocellulosic material with a high productivity of volatile fatty acids (VFA), such as acetic, propionic and butyric acids [8]. The favorable efficiency of ruminal microorganisms to digest cellulose complexes is due to their adhesion to the substrate through the enzymatic complexes present in the outer cellular membrane (cellulosomes). That adhesion promotes a decoupling between the hydraulic retention time (HRT) from the solid retention time (SRT), favoring the removal of final fermentation products that could inhibit the degradation process [9]. In this sense, the produced VFA are absorbed by the epithelial cells in ruminants and the hydrogen produced by the cellulolytic bacteria is consumed by archaea to be subsequently eliminated, which avoids the inhibition by the final products [10]. Wild et al. [11] evaluated the biodegradability of microalgae by ruminal microorganisms in batch. The results concluded that ruminal fermentation was low for all the microalgae studied, considering the low production of biogas, VFA and protein degradation. However, the authors emphasized that the microbiota present in the ruminal fluid was not adapted to the microalgae as a substrate, suggesting that these values can be increased using an inoculum acclimatized to the microalgae. In this sense, Giménez et al. [12] recently reported the use of a rumen-like fermenter to produce methane from Scenedesmus, which reached up to 214 mL CH4 g-COD−1; using an HRT of 31 d and SRT of 100 d while Zamorano-López et al. [13] discussed the role of Fervidobacterium and Methanosaeta in the biodegradability of Scenedesmus in that system. However, ruminal microorganisms are specialized in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into VFA and not in the production of methane. Studies carried out in discontinuous systems have demonstrated the potential of ruminal microorganisms to produce VFA from lignocellulosic [14] or microalgal biomass [15]. That suggests that the high hydrolytic activity present in the ruminal fluid could be maintained for extended periods and then utilized to pretreat microalgal biomass. Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16] validated the potential of ruminal microorganisms to pretreat a native consortium of microalgae (Scenedesmus), and their results showed a methane yield of 192 mL CH4 g-COD−1. Those authors also observed that separating the process into two stages (pretreatment and methanization) decreased the total process time significantly to 7 days. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is scarce information on the use of ruminal fluid to recovering hydrolysates of microalgae rich in sugars, which can be subsequently used to produce hydrogen by dark fermentation. Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16] reported that the increase in the reaction time (higher than 3 days) produced a decrease in sugars in the soluble fraction using microalgae as a substrate (and ruminal fluid as the inoculum). Zhao et al. [15] studied the effect of HRT (4.2, 8, 12 and 16 days) on the production of VFA and found that the performance of VFA increases proportionally to HRT, with the maximum productivity at an HRT of 12 days. Previous reports suggest that when the HRT is manipulated, it is possible to obtain a hydrolysate rich in either carbohydrates or VFA. Based on what has been discussed, HRT lower than 3 days may be candidates for sugar recovery, while longer HRT promote the recovery of VFA. This work aimed to describe a long-term microalgal biomass hydrolysis process in a sequencing batch reactor inoculated with ruminal fluid. The influence of the HRT was evaluated in such a way to obtain a hydrolysate rich either in VFA or sugars, to increase the production of hydrogen or methane in a subsequent stage. The effectiveness of the process was evaluated in terms of the solubilization of sugars, COD, hydrogen and methane production, as well as energy recovery. The selected ruminal bacteria and endogenous bacteria from the native microalgae consortium were characterized based on 16S rRNA using next-generation sequencing and the role of these bacteria in the hydrolysis of algal biomass was discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Microalgal biomass, ruminal fluid and anaerobic sludge","2.1 Microalgal biomass, ruminal fluid and anaerobic sludge 2.1.1 Native consortium of microalgae and ruminal fluid Both the native consortium of microalgae and the ruminal fluid were obtained based on the methodology described by Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16]. Table 1 summarizes the physicochemical characteristics of this consortium, while the content of total solids (TS) and volatile (VS) of the ruminal fluid were determined to be 11.76 and 10.16% (w/v). 2.1.2 Anaerobic sludge producing hydrogen and methane The inoculum for the hydrogen and methane production tests was granular anaerobic sludge obtained from a brewing industry reactor. The TS and VS contents of the inoculum were 28 and 19 g L−1, respectively. Before use in the hydrogen production tests, the anaerobic sludge was subjected to a thermal pretreatment (105 °C/24 h) to select the hydrogen-producing bacteria capable of sporulating [17]. After the thermal treatment, the sludge was ground in a mortar, sieved in a # 20 mesh (850 μm) and stored at room temperature until use."
3,Experimental design,"2.2 Experimental design 2.2.1 Discontinuous hydrolysis of microalgal biomass A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with a 1 L working volume (Applikon Bioreactor Systems, Netherlands) was used. The reactor was operated at 35 °C, with a stirring velocity of 100 rpm and a regulated pH at 7.0. The reactor was inoculated with 10 g VS L−1 of ruminal fluid and 5 g VS L−1 of microalgal biomass as the substrate at an S0/X0 ratio of 0.5 according to Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16]. A mineral medium that emulates the saliva of ruminants [18] was used. The mineral medium composition was as follows (mg L−1): (NH4)2SO4, 1300; K2HPO4, 2040; NaHCO3, 400; NaCl, 80; MgSO4·7H2O, 19.2; FeSO4·7H2O, 1.1; CaCl2, 8; and KH2PO4, 40 The feeding and decantation times were 0.5 and 1 h, respectively. The feed and discharge of the bioreactor were carried out with a variable speed peristaltic pump (Masterflex, USA). The volume exchange for each cycle was 50% of the supernatant and was replaced with a fresh medium containing 5 g VS microalgae L−1. Two HRT (2 and 3 days) were tested for 45 days to favor the recovery of sugars from the hydrolysate biomass. In a subsequent assay, to obtain an effluent rich in VFA, the HRT was gradually decreased, once a fixed percentage of 60% hydrolysis efficiency was reached. So, the duration of the reaction phase of the discontinuous reactor was variable, decreasing the HRT as the fixed hydrolysis efficiency was attained. That procedure was named variable time acclimation. A stability criterion was also applied to reduce the HRT and consisted of considering that at least 3 cycles with the same hydrolysis efficiency and a coefficient of variation lower than 10% were obtained. 2.2.2 Hydrogen production tests The hydrolysates enriched in sugars were used as a substrate for the hydrogen production test. A substrate-to-inoculum ratio of 2 was employed with an inoculum concentration of 6.7 g VS L−1. The experiments were performed in triplicate in 120 mL glass serum bottles with 80 mL of working volume using the mineral medium previously described by Mizuno et al. [19], an initial pH value of 6.5, 35 °C and constant shaking (150 rpm). All bottles were closed with butyl rubber stoppers and sealed with aluminum caps. The headspace was purged with N2 for 1 min. In parallel experiments, control experiments were run with biomass without the pretreatment, as well as control experiments with only the thermally treated anaerobic sludge, to subtract the endogenous hydrogen production. Glucose was used as a positive control to verify the fermentative activity of the pretreated anaerobic sludge. Hydrogen production was measured by liquid displacement (an acidic solution-filled inverted test cylinder was used), and its composition was characterized by gas chromatography. The tests stopped when the coefficient of variation between the last three measurements was lower than 5%. Hydrogen production was expressed at STP conditions (0 °C and 1 atm). At the end of the kinetics, the soluble fraction was characterized by measuring the VFA and alcohols produced by gas chromatography. A coefficient of variation of less than 10% between the replicates was considered as a quality criterion. 2.2.3 Biochemical methane potential The hydrolysate enriched in VFA was used as a substrate for methane production tests. The tests were carried out in triplicate using 120 mL glass serum bottles with 80 mL of working volume. The tests were inoculated with 8 g TS L−1 of methanogenic sludge at 35 °C and constant shaking at 150 rpm. The reactors were closed with butyl rubber and aluminum seals. Subsequently, they were gassed with N2 gas for 1 min. In parallel experiments, control experiments were run with microalgal biomass without pretreatment. Blank tests containing only anaerobic sludge were carried out to subtract endogenous methane production. Glucose was used as a positive control to verify the methanogenic activity of the anaerobic granular sludge. The biogas produced was measured daily by liquid displacement using an acid solution (pH value of 2) in an inverted test cylinder, and its composition was determined by gas chromatography. The tests stopped when the coefficient of variation between the last three measurements was lower than 5%. Results of methane production were expressed at STP conditions (1 atm and 0 °C). A coefficient of variation of less than 10% was considered to validate the tests. 2.2.4 Characterization of bacterial communities At the end of the test, biomass samples were taken and stored at −20 °C for the subsequent characterization of the bacterial community. The DNA extraction was performed using the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation kit (MOBIO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA integrity was verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with SYBR Green (Invitrogen, USA), using a DNA molecular weight marker (250 bp ladder, Invitrogen, USA) as a reference. DNA concentration was performed by spectrophotometry using a NANODrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific, USA). For the identification of bacterial species, the extracted DNA was submitted for sequencing to the Research and Testing Laboratory (Texas, USA). The 16S rRNA genes were amplified in their V1–V2 hypervariable region with the 28F-388R universal primers and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., USA). Finally, the analysis of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and construction of heatmap was carried out based on what was previously described by Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16]."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Samples were taken daily to quantify hydrolysis efficiency, which was measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization, sugars and carbohydrolase activity (endoglucanase, xylanase and α-amylase activity), VFA and alcohols. The quantification of carbohydrolase activity (endoglucanase, xylanase and amylase activity) was carried out following the methodology previously described by Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16]. The concentrations of VS, TS and COD were determined according to standard methods [20]. Total sugars were quantified by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using d-glucose as a standard [21]. The reducing sugars were quantified by the dinitrosalicylic acid method [22], using glucose, xylose and maltose as standards, according to the enzymatic activity of interest. The different enzymatic activities were expressed in international units (IU) and defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of reducing sugars per minute. The protein concentration was quantified by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard [23]. The lipid content was calculated by the method of Bligh and Dyer [24]. Soluble metabolites (acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acid) were quantified with a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890B, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) [25]. On the other hand, the gas composition was determined with a gas chromatograph (SRI Instruments 8610C, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) [16]. 2.3.1 Kinetics of hydrogen or methane production A kinetic analysis of hydrogen and methane production was performed using the modified Gompertz equation (Equation (1)) [17]: (1) M t = M m a x ∗ e x p − e x p 2.71828 ∗ R m a x λ − t M m a x + 1 where M max (mL H2 g-VS−1 or mL CH4 g-COD−1) is the maximum amount of methane or hydrogen produced, R max (mL H2 g-VS−1d−1 or mL CH4 g-COD−1d-1) is the maximum speed of specific production of methane (or hydrogen), λ (d) is the time of the latency phase before the exponential production of biogas, and t (d) is the incubation time. The volume data were expressed under standard conditions (273.15 K and 1 atm). The values obtained from M max and R max in the different tests were subjected to an analysis of variance (ANOVA F-test, p = 0.05)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Discontinuous hydrolysis of microalgal biomass,"3.1 Discontinuous hydrolysis of microalgal biomass 3.1.1 Recovery of sugars The hydrolytic activity and the solubilization of sugars (and COD) were monitored using an HRT of 2 and 3 days (Fig. 1 A, before day 45). After 6 days of operation with an HRT of 2 days, approximately 21% and 18% of the endoglucanase and xylanase activity were conserved, respectively, as well as 12% of the amylase activity (Fig. 1A). Lazuka et al. [14] monitored the carbohydrolase activity when studying the degradability of wheat straw in the presence of an enriched ruminal microbial consortium in a batch reaction for 15 days, and the endoglucanase activity (20–40 IU L−1) was similar to that found in the present work; on the other hand, the xylanase activity was approximately double (200 IU L−1) during the first two days of the batch reaction, reaching up to 90 IU L−1 after 15 days. That indicated that longer reaction times are related to an increase in xylanase activity. The outer layer of sporopollenins and algaenans present in the cell wall of microalgae difficult the enzymes to access the polysaccharide wall [3]. Similar to the measurement of enzymatic activity, the soluble fraction was characterized, and carbohydrate solubilization was calculated (Fig. 1B). Once the stability of the system was reached, with an HRT of 2 days, a carbohydrate solubilization of 16 ± 1.4% was achieved. In the literature, several attempts to hydrolyze the cell wall of Scenedesmus strains have been used. In this sense, the recovery of soluble sugars from algal biomass using ruminal fluid is similar to that obtained with enzymatic hydrolysis [26] but less compared to thermochemical hydrolysis [25,27]. Considering that up to 3 days have been reported in the literature as the optimal hydrolysis time of microalgal biomass with ruminal fluid [16], the HRT was increased to 3 days after 32 days of the reactor operation (Fig. 1A and B), which caused an increase between 2 and 3 times in the carbohydrolase activity. However, there was a drastic decrease in the percentage of sugars present in the soluble fraction, reaching values of up to 3%. The reduction in the percentage of carbohydrates in the soluble fraction can be associated with the consumption of carbohydrates by fermentative bacteria present in the ruminal fluid [28], which was reflected by an increase in the production of VFA (data not shown). Since the objective of this experiment was the recovery of soluble sugars, the HRT was readjusted to a value of 2 days, which resulted in 16% solubilization of carbohydrates. Seventy-six percent of the initial carbohydrates were still conserved in the particulate biomass (microalgae); however, pretreatment with ruminal fluid will also improve the assimilation of these carbohydrates. It is significant to mention that the hydrolytic activity of the rumen fluid was maintained during the 45 days that the discontinuous system was operated. 3.1.2 Pretreatment of microalgal biomass and production of VFA To maximize the hydrolysis efficiency of microalgal biomass an acclimation strategy with variable times was applied (Fig. 1, after day 45), allowing to obtain a solubilization of at least 60% of the particulate biomass. In this case, the reaction times were longer than those applied in the carbohydrate's recovery experiment, given that the generation times of acetogenic bacteria can be longer than 6 days, depending on the nature of the substrate [29]. Considering that the exchange volume was 50%, the first reaction phase ended with an HRT of 32 days and gradually decreased until 8 days after 5 cycles of operation (Fig. 1B), indicating the suitability of the variable time strategy. It was observed that at the end of each period, the VFA represented more than 75% of the soluble COD, of which the acetic acid represented more than 90% of the total fatty acids. Using ruminal fluid as an inoculum, Zhao et al. [15] studied the effect of HRT on the conversion of microalgal biomass (Scenedesmus) to VFA. Those authors found that when using an HRT of 16 days, the hydrolysis efficiency was near to 60%, and the VFA represented 45%. The maximum productivity of VFA was 0.80 g VFA L−1d−1 at the end of the acclimation process. The hydrolysis efficiency achieved with the variable time strategy is higher than that reported with enzymatic pretreatments [26] and similar to that obtained with ruminal fluid, as reported by Zhao et al. [15]. In the present study, the reactors were operated for up to 96 days, without loss of activity, strengthening the idea that it is possible to maintain a hydrolytic reactor for long durations when ruminal fluid is used as the inoculum. The observed increase in the hydrolytic activity can be explained by considering that the production of VFA avoided the inhibition of the carbohydrolase activity by the accumulation of soluble sugars (mainly monosaccharides). In that sense, Lazuka et al. [14], using wheat straw as a substrate, found a higher xylanase and CMCase activity at reaction times of 15 days than the enzymatic activity observed at 2 and 3 days. As no methanogenesis inhibitors were added to the culture media, as reported in other studies [15], a small amount of methane generation was observed. For the first cycle, that methane generation represented 4.5% of the COD feed and decreased to 3% by the end of the sixth cycle, which could support the idea that methanogenic archaea were washed out during the acclimation process."
7,Hydrolytic microorganisms,"3.2 Hydrolytic microorganisms 3.2.1 Native culture of microalgae and ruminal fluid Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus were found in the bacterial community of the native culture of ruminal fluid and accounting for only 0.9% of the OTUs. Those microorganisms are reported as responsible for carbohydrolase activity in the rumen [28]. The diet of the ruminant influences the microbiota present in the ruminal fluid. In this sense, Petri et al. [29] found a relative abundance of Eubacterium and Prevotella, depending on whether the ruminants were fed with forage or concentrates and the most abundant genera were. The bacteria of the genus Eubacterium belong to the phylum Firmicutes and can degrade both cellulose and xylan; Prevotella belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and can digest xylan; these metabolic capacities have been discussed by Flint et al. [28]. The endogenous bacterial community of the native microalgal culture used is mainly represented by Pseudomonas, a genus that represents 88% of the OTUs. The bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas belong to the phylum Proteobacteria and have great metabolic versatility, and they are able to degrade very recalcitrant compounds, such as cutin, lignin, alkanes and aromatic compounds, in an anaerobic environment [30]; both alkanes and aromatics compounds are known to be present in sporopollenins. It has been reported that bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas have algicidal capacity (ability to lyse microalgae) and have been isolated from the digestive tract of mollusks that digest microalgae in their natural environment [6]. However, the carbohydrolase activity for Pseudomonas has not been reported under anaerobic conditions, possibly slowing autohydrolysis. Besides, it has already been reported that autohydrolysis is not a viable pretreatment method [16]. 3.2.2 Hydrolytic bacteria responsible for the solubilization of sugars Fig. 2 shows that the bacterial community found with an HRT of 2 days is the combination of the bacteria present in the inoculum and in the native culture of microalgae. The most abundant selected hydrolytic bacteria were Pseudomonas (35%), Acinetobacter (22%) and Bacteroides (5%). Acinetobacter is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. They are bacteria with high cellulolytic capacity that have been isolated from termite digestive tracts [31]. On the other hand, Bacteroides are gram-negative bacilli that belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes and have the ability to degrade xylan [28]. Both Acinetobacter and Bacteroides were enriched from ruminal fluid, as reported by Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16], when using carboxymethylcellulose and xylan, respectively, in sequential discontinuous cultures. 3.2.3 Fermentative bacteria Pseudomonas (45%), Parabacteroides (7%), Proteocatella (4%) and Clostridium (3%) constituted the most abundant hydrolytic bacteria found after the acclimation with the variable time strategy. The bacteria of the genus Parabacteroides belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes [32], while the clostridia belong to the phylum Firmicutes [33]. Those bacteria are characterized by their ability to degrade both structural polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin) and reserve polysaccharides (starch). On the other hand, Proteocatella, belonging to the phylum Firmicute, possess proteolytic activity [34]. A high relative abundance of Pseudomonas (>35%) was found in all cases. Acinetobacter (22%) was present in the experiment where an effluent rich in sugars was obtained (HRT = 2 days); whereas its relative abundance was scarce (<1%) when the hydrolysate was rich in VFA. These results suggest that the operating conditions have a significant effect on the selection of microorganisms."
8,Gaseous biofuel production,"3.3 Gaseous biofuel production 3.3.1 Hydrogen production A positive control (glucose) test and an endogenous test were run in parallel to validate the assays (Fig. S1A). From that, 57 ± 2 mL H2 g-sugar−1 (or 796 ± 25 mL H2 L−1) were recovered which represents 11.5% of the theoretical value (498 mL H2 g-sugar−1) [35]. This value is consistent with that reported by Tapia-Rodríguez et al. [36]. The low yields can be explained by the low pH at the end of the test (4.6 ± 0.2). At that pH the metabolism was redirected to the production of alcohol (ethanol), which in turn decreased the hydrogen production (Fig. S2) [37]. The hydrolysate obtained in the previous section was utilized to produce hydrogen by dark fermentation (Fig. 3 A). A significant increase in both the specific hydrogen production rate and in the molar yield was observed when the hydrolysates were compared to the microalgal biomass without pretreatment (Fig. 3A, Table 2 ). That indicates that the hydrolytic culture improved the bioavailability and assimilation of carbohydrates present in the microalgae. Considering the total sugars present in the microalgae up to 38% of the maximum theoretical value of hydrogen production was obtained for the microalgae pretreated. The molar yield obtained with the present pretreatment is similar to that reported by other authors using chemical hydrolysis [25,38] (Table 3 ). However, those pretreatments have the disadvantage of generating byproducts that are inhibitory for fermentative bacteria. The molar yield obtained in the present work is similar or higher than some of the values reported in the literature using carbohydrates-rich microalgae cultures [39] and/or pure fermentative cultures [38]. The specific hydrogen yield was similar to that reported by other authors using thermochemical pretreatments [25,27]. During dark fermentation, acetate production represented 56% of the VFA produced, indicating suitable assimilation of sugars through the pathway where 4 mol of hydrogen are produced per mol of carbohydrate (glucose) (Fig. 4 A). That is also observed in the acetate/butyrate molar ratio, which was higher in the pretreated biomass (6.5) than in the raw biomass (4). The lower hydrogen production from raw biomass can be explained by the higher propionate production (17% vs. 11% in the hydrolysate biomass), which is a metabolic pathway that consumes hydrogen equivalents. The pH at the end of the tests was 5.8 ± 0.3 and 6.0 ± 0.2 using raw and pretreated algae, respectively. Because of that no solvents were detected, which is a favorable aspect for the production of hydrogen. The hydrogen concentration observed when the hydrolyzed algae was used (51%) was higher than that obtained when raw microalgae was fermented (43%). 3.3.2 Methane production Fig. 3B shows the course of the methane production as a function of time. The positive glucose control yielded a methanogenic potential of 338 ± 5 mL CH4 g-COD−1 (Fig. S1B). That represents 95% of the theoretical value, considering the theoretical equivalence of 350 mL CH4 g-COD−1 [42]. Therefore, the activity of the inoculum used for the biochemical methane potential was validated. Significant higher methane yields and methane production rates were obtained (2.9 and 4 times higher, respectively) when biomass pretreated with ruminal fluid was used compared with raw biomass (Fig. 3B, Table 2). The yield achieved (285 mL CH4 g-COD−1) corresponds to 81% of the anaerobic biodegradability. Recently, Rincón-Peréz et al. [27] reported that the thermochemical pretreatment of Scenede s mus obtusiusculus did not significantly improve the methane yield with respect to raw biomass. González-Fernández et al. [43] reached 170 mL CH4 g-COD−1 by applying a thermal pretreatment to Scenedesmus; Mahdy et al. [26] used enzymes with protease activity and recovered 216 mL CH4 g-COD−1. Recently, Barragán-Trinidad et al. [16] reported 193 mL CH4 g-COD−1 when using ruminal fluid in the pretreatment of native microalgal culture. Ciudad et al. [44] achieved up to 90% anaerobic biodegradability by applying an enzymatic extract (predominately peroxidase activity) to the microalgae Botryococcus braunii, a microalga with a very resistant cell wall such as that of Scenedesmus. The hydrolyzed biomass was better assimilated by anaerobic sludge than the raw biomass (Fig. 4B). The COD removal for pretreated and non-treated microalgae was 89% and 55%, respectively. The best assimilation occurred because the VFA (rich in acetate) generated during the pre-treatment directly enter the stage of methanogenesis and was reflected in the increase in the specific methane production rate (Table 2). Total process time (pretreatment plus methanization) was 20 days, less than the HRT that has been reported when the anaerobic digestion of Scenedesmus is carried out in a single stage. For instance, Giménez et al. [12] digest Scenedesmus in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (HRT = 31 d, SRT = 100 d) using ruminal fluid as the inoculum. Results found in the present work suggest that separating the hydrolysis from the methanogenic stage improves the yield and the rate of methane production, even when microalgae with cell walls resistant to anaerobic biodegradability, such as Scenedesmus, are used as the substrate. This study demonstrated that it is possible to maintain a stable hydrolytic activity in a discontinuous system fed with microalgal biomass, which is technically competitive with enzymatic or chemical pretreatments."
9,Energy recovery,"3.4 Energy recovery Based on the composition of the native microalgae consortium and the energy density of the quantified macromolecules (17, 17 and 37 kJ g−1 for carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, respectively), the caloric content of 13.17 kJ g-VS−1 was estimated for the biomass used. This value was lower than the value reported by other authors [25,45]. One reason could be the lower lipid content. In this work, the concentration of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and ash only explained 70% of the biomass's composition. Meaning that 30% of the biomass was not characterized, and such fraction could correspond to organic molecules with a high caloric content (high degree of reduction). Assuming an equivalence of 350 mL CH4 g-DQO−1 and a methane energy density of 35.9 MJ m−3, the theoretical caloric content of the biomass was calculated giving a value of 22.4 kJ g-VS−1, consistent to the data reported for Scenede s mus [25,45] and other chlorophytes with high energy content [46]. The pretreatment of the native consortium of microalgae with ruminal fluid improved energy recovery, from 6.3 kJ g-VS−1 to 16.3 kJ g-VS−1, which represents 73% of the theoretical value. On the other hand, considering that during dark fermentation, all carbohydrates are converted to hydrogen and the caloric content of 10.78 MJ m−3 [47], a theoretical value of 1.52 kJ g-VS−1 was estimated for the production of hydrogen from biomass employed. Hydrolysis with ruminal fluid improved the energy recovery 1.7 times (from 0.3 kJ g-VS−1 to 0.5 kJ g-VS−1), representing 34% of the theoretical value. The energy recovery can be further increased if hydrogen production is coupled to an anaerobic digestion process in sequence."
10,Conclusions,"It was demonstrated that it is possible to maintain the reactor's hydrolytic activity for long periods when ruminal fluid is used as the inoculum. The hydrolysis of microalgal biomass with ruminal fluid resulted in high hydrolysis efficiencies (up to 70%). A low HRT (2 days) leads to the systems to generate a hydrolyzate suitable for dark fermentation, whereas applying a high HRT (8 days), volatile fatty acids are produced. The pretreatment of the microalgal biomass in the hydrolytic reactor significantly improved the gaseous biofuel production. The hydrogen and methane production increased by 1.7 and 2.9 times, respectively, compared to the not pretreated biomass. Such results were reflected in high energy conversion, recovering up to 16.3 kJ g-VS−1 as methane and 0.5 kJ g-VS−1 from the hydrogen, representing 70% of the theoretical value. The most abundant bacteria present in the culture were Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Acinetobacter and Proteocatella."
