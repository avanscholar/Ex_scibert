0,Introduction,"Biomass (microbes, plants, animals, and their organic waste products) provides approximately 14% of the world’s energy needs. In developing countries, which often have limited supplies of fossil fuels but abundant biomass resources, as much as 35% of the energy demand is supplied by biomass (McGowan, 1991; Hall et al., 1992). However, in developed countries with still abundant fossil fuel supplies, reliance on biomass as an energy resource is very limited, despite its huge energy potential. Canada, for example, is a biomass-rich developed country with an average annual commercial harvest of forest and agricultural biomass of approximately 1.43×108 t carbon (Woods and Layzell, 2003). This biomass has a potential energy content of approximately 2.25×109 GJ, which is equivalent to approximately 22% of Canada’s fossil fuel demand (estimated to be 1.04×1010 GJ in 2001; International Energy Agency, 2004a). Yet, Canada supplies less than 5% of its energy from biomass and the OECD countries collectively achieved a mere 1% increase, to only 3.3%, in use of renewable energy between 1973 and 2002 (International Energy Association, 2004). Unused, discarded biomass residues from forestry, agriculture, and municipal sources are a potential energy resource, which at present are not well managed and thus pose significant environmental problems. Consequently, discarded waste biomass from these sectors is responsible for about 10% of Canada’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CARC/BIOCAP, 2003). A more effective use of this resource for bio-energy and related by-products could contribute to displacement of fossil fuel emissions and also achieve direct mitigation of GHG emissions implicated in climate change. Anaerobic digestion has traditionally been used in the wastewater treatment industry to reduce both the volume and the organic content of waste sludge. As anaerobic digestion technologies have evolved and improved, the process has been applied to the treatment of a wide range of high-strength liquid wastes, as well as various solid organic wastes, to reduce the BOD of waste effluent or divert solid waste from disposal and to produce biogas, containing a mixture of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (De Baere, 2000). Conventional anaerobic digestion of organic materials results in a biogas consisting primarily of CH4 (50–65%) and CO2 (35–50%) (Wollin and Miller, 1987). Anaerobic digestion is accomplished by a complex community of anaerobic microorganisms. The methanogenic (CH4-forming) bacteria are the terminal group of microorganisms in a complex community that degrade organic biomass. Methanogens live in close association with other species of fermentative anaerobic bacteria that breakdown complex organic molecules and synthesize organic acids (acetic acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, etc.), alcohols (ethanol, butanol, propanol, etc.), and gaseous by-products. These bacteria are referred to as acidogenic bacteria (acid-formers). Acidogenic bacteria within the genus Clostridium play a key role in anaerobic degradation of carbohydrates, and the primary gas by-products they synthesize are hydrogen (H2) and CO2. The organic acids and H2 produced by the acidogenic bacteria are in turn, typically metabolized by the methanogens for CH4-production (Wollin and Miller, 1987; Leschine, 1995). Significant amounts of H2 and organic acid products may be produced from biomass feedstock using conventional anaerobic digestion technology under conditions that favor H2-producing acidogenic bacteria and inhibit CH4 producing bacteria (Lay et al., 1999; Lay, 2000; Liang et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003; Ueno et al., 1995, 1996; Chang et al., 2002; Hawkes et al., 2002; Levin et al., 2004). Hydrogen can also be produced from cellulosic biomass feedstocks that have been pre-treated (e.g., by acid hydrolysis or by enzymatic hydrolysis). These steps breakdown the cellulose and hemicellulose fibers into constituent sugars that may be easily metabolized by H2 producing bacteria (Taguchi et al., 1996; Lay, 2001; Chang et al., 2002). Pre-treatment technologies (Lynd et al., 2002; Demain et al., 2005) capable of liberating lignin-encased cellulosic carbon for microbial utilization, such as the SUBBOR process utilizing pressure disruption (Liu et al., 2002), have also improved biomass utilization for CH4 and thus, possibly for H2-production as well. Enhanced biomass use for bio-energy and related by-products could provide significant economic and environmental benefits, notably: reducing GHG and other environmental emissions, providing municipalities, forest industries and the animal and food production sectors with reuse markets for their ‘waste’ materials, and stimulating the rural economy by providing new domestic and international markets for Canada’s forest and agricultural waste by-products. It has not been clear, however, as to the overall potential energy (in the form of CH4 or H2) that can actually be derived from various waste biomass resources. What portion of the energy content within waste biomass can be recovered by anaerobic digestion technologies? Which bio-fuel, CH4 or H2, offers the best energy value? Which biomass residues offer the greatest potential for bio-fuels production? A significant potential for this source of microbial bio-energy, if confirmed, might help stimulate research and commercial interest for exploiting this natural biomass potential. We address these questions here, by analyzing biogas energy recovery potentials from various waste biomass categories in Canada. Using available waste biomass inventories, we calculate the total usable substrate that could be metabolized by anaerobic bacteria, and determine the theoretical energy content of this biomass. Then using published, conservative conversion and yield data, we calculate the volume, mass, and heating values of CH4 and H2 that could be derived from each category of available biomass residue inventory in each province of Canada. The yield potentials are then discussed in the context of practical availability of biomass."
1,Methods,
2,Calculation of waste biomass inventories,"2.1 Calculation of waste biomass inventories Total biomass inventories for each province were tabulated for six biomass categories (Table 1 ): woody non-stem residues, wood product residues, agricultural crop residues, livestock manure residues, organic municipal solid waste residues (OMSW), and municipal biosolids. Using published conversion factors, the volume, mass, and energy content (heating value) of CH4 and H2 that could be produced annually by anaerobic fermentation, were calculated for each province. The annual total dry weight of woody non-stem residues and wood product residues were adapted from Tables 2.6 and 2.7, respectively, in the report of Woods and Layzell (2003). The total dry weight per year of agricultural crop residue were derived from Table 1 in the report of Helwig et al. (2002) and Tables 3.1 and 3.3 in the report of Cheng and Edwards (2002). The annual total dry weight of OMSW and municipal biosolids were adapted from Tables 4.4 and 4.5, respectively, in the report of Woods and Layzell (2003). Total and volatile dry weight fractions of livestock manure residues per year were calculated based on agricultural census data of the animal numbers in Statistics Canada (2001). Fresh manure production from cattle, swine, and poultry was calculated by using the average fresh manure production per tonne live animal and average weights of the corresponding animals. The average fresh manure productions per tonne-live animal for dairy cows, beef cows, pigs, layer hens, and broiler chickens were 86, 58, 84, 64 and 85kg/day (Table 1, ASAE Standards, 2003), respectively. The average weights of these animals adopted were 640, 360, 61, 1.8 and 0.9kg, respectively (Table 1, ASAE Standards, 2003). The annual total dry weight (TS) and volatile dry weight (VS) for each type of fresh manure were calculated by multiplying the total annual mass of fresh manure by the average percent solids contents (14.3% for cattle, 13% for swine, and 25.5% for poultry) and by the average volatile solids fraction of each (11.9% for cattle, 10.1% for swine, and 19.5% for poultry; see Table 1, ASAE Standards, 2003). The total volatile dry weight for all agricultural manure was used for the calculation of potential CH4-production for this category of biomass residue."
3,Calculation of potential CH4-production,"2.2 Calculation of potential CH4-production Calculation of the fermentable substrate for CH4-production was based on assuming an average volatile solid (VS) content of 70% in the total dry weight, except for livestock manure residues. The volatile solid calculation of livestock manure residues was as described above and a reduction of the VS by anaerobic digestion of 50% was assumed (Stafford et al., 1980). The rates of CH4-production differed for each category of biomass as follows. The rate of CH4-production per tonne of woody non-stem residue and wood product residues was based on the CH4 yield data for ligno-cellulosic biomass of 143m3/t volatile substance (Owens and Chynoweth, 1993). Calculation of the volume of CH4 produced from agricultural crop residues was based on a conversion rate of 465m3/t VS, derived from the averaged rate of biogas production from grass (560m3/t VS) and potato tops (610m3/t VS) multiplied by the average percentage of CH4 from each (84% and 75%, respectively; see Table 26 in Chapter 9, Stafford et al., 1980). Calculation of the volume of CH4 produced from livestock manure was based on a conversion rate of 350m3/t VS (Table 5 in Chapter 9, Stafford et al., 1980). The volume of CH4 produced from OMSW was determined by using a rate of 391m3/t VS, based on a rate of biogas production of 630m3/t and a CH4 content of 62% (Table 26 in Chapter 9, Stafford et al., 1980). The volume of CH4 produced from biosolids was determined using a rate of 476m3/t VS, based on a rate of biogas production of 610m3/t and a CH4 content of 78% (Table 26 in Chapter 9, Stafford et al., 1980). The mass of CH4 produced was calculated using the density of CH4 0.72kg/m3, at standard conditions. The heating value of CH4 was calculated using the gravimetric heating value of CH4 at standard conditions, which is 55.6 MJ/t (Probstein and Hicks, 1982)."
4,Calculation of potential H2-production,"2.3 Calculation of potential H2-production Calculation of the total fermentable substrate for H2-production varied for each category of biomass. Calculation of fermentable substrate for H2-production from woody non-stem residues and woody product residues was based on an assumed cellulose content of 40% and a hemicellulose component of 30% in total dry weight (Haygfeen and Bowyer, 1996). The hemicellulose fraction of all cellulosic biomass residues was assumed to have a combined fermentable six- and five-carbon sugar content of 61% (Department of Energy, 2003). Calculation of the volume of H2 derived from all biomass residues, except biosolids, was based on an H2-production rate of 193m3/t cellulose (Ueno et al., 1995). Calculation of the fermentable substrate in agricultural crop residues for H2-production was based on an assumed cellulose content of 40% and a hemicellulose component of 20%. Calculation of the fermentable substrate per total dry weight of livestock manure was based on assumed cellulose contents of 17%, 33% and 23%, and hemicellulose contents of 19.0%, 53.8% and 11.9% in cattle, swine and poultry manure, respectively (Table 8.1, in Zehnder, 1988). Calculation of the fermentable substrate in OMSW was based on an assumed cellulose content of 40% and a hemicellulose component of 20%. Calculation of the fermentable biosolids substrate in total dry weight of municipal biosolids was based on an assumed fermentable carbohydrate content of 33.5% (Table 1 in Chapter 4, Stafford et al., 1980). Calculation of the volume of H2 derived from municipal biosolids was based on an H2-production rate of 287m3 H2/t glucose (Liu et al., 2003). The mass of H2 produced was calculated using the density of H2 at standard conditions, which is 0.09kg/m3. The gravimetric heating value used for H2 was 142GJ/t (Department of Energy, 2001). Methane production was calculated from the volatile solid content, which includes protein and fat material. Biohydrogen production has been reported mainly from various carbohydrates. In our knowledge, there is only one study (Lay et al., 2003) that reports on H2-production from lean meat, egg, chicken skin and fat meat. Hydrogen production from these substrates was only 5–10% of that from carbohydrate materials (rice and potato), and thus we have not endeavored to calculate H2-production from protein or fat contained in livestock wastes."
5,Results,
6,Waste biomass inventories,"3.1 Waste biomass inventories Based on biomass inventories conducted in 2001 and 2003, Canada generates approximately 1.45×108 metric tonnes of biomass residues per year (Table 1). Theoretically, this biomass contains approximately 6.38×107 t of carbon containing an energy value of 2.28×109 GJ. This equates to approximately 22% of Canada’s 2001 energy use (approximately 1.04×1010 GJ/year; International Energy Agency, 2004a). Woody non-stem biomass constitutes the largest portion (approximately 63%) of the total biomass residue inventory in Canada."
7,Potential CH4-production,"3.2 Potential CH4-production Anaerobic digestion of these biomass residues using conventional technologies could generate approximately 1.14×1010 m3 CH4/year. This volume of CH4 would have a mass of 8.21×106 t/year with a heating value of 4.56×108 GJ/year (Table 2 ). The energy value of CH4 produced represents approximately 4.4% of Canada’s total energy use in 2001. Woody non-stem forestry residues constitute the largest at 40% of the total annual potential CH4-production from biomass residues in Canada. Table 3 displays the total heating value of CH4 obtained from each biomass category, in each province in Canada. The provinces with the greatest CH4-production potential are Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. The total combined potential yield of CH4 produced from these three provinces (2.8×108 GJ/year) constitutes 61% of the total CH4 energy values that could be derived from the biomass residues in Canada, and represents the equivalent of 2.7% of Canada’s total energy demand for 2001."
8,Potential H2-production,"3.3 Potential H2-production Alternatively, conversion of these residual biomass feedstocks using emerging technologies that favor the synthesis of H2 by representing CH4 synthesis could potentially generate approximately 1.47×1010 m3 H2/year, representing a mass of 1.32×106 t/year, and with a heating value of 1.88×108 GJ/year (Table 4 ). This energy potential represents 1.8% of Canada’s total energy demand for 2001. The highest H2 energy value (1.32×108 GJ/year) was also obtained from woody non-stem residues, representing 70% of the potential H2 energy value from the total biomass residues, and 1.3% of Canada’s total energy demand for 2001. Table 5 displays the total potential heating values of H2 obtained from each biomass category, in each province in Canada. The provinces with the greatest H2-production potential were again Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. The combined H2 energy values from these three provinces (1.68×108 GJ/year) constitute 89% of the total potential H2 energy values that could be derived from the biomass residues in Canada, or 1.6% of Canada’s total energy demand for 2001. Comparison of the total bio-energy production potentials for CH4 and H2 (Table 6 ) reveals that more energy can be recovered via CH4-production than that from H2-production. The energy recovery efficiencies for CH4-production, as a percentage of the theoretical carbon energy value, range from 13% (forestry residues) to 42% (biosolids and agricultural crop residues), while values for H2-production range from 5% (livestock manure) to 10% (municipal biosolids)."
9,Discussion,"Significant amounts of ‘waste’ biomass are produced from the forestry, agricultural and municipal sectors across Canada. The mass of these biomass residues generated each year is very large at approximately 1.45×108 t, containing about 6.38×107 t of carbon with an energy value of 2.28×109 GJ. This now unused resource represents approximately 22% of Canada’s current annual energy demand and could thus meet a significant portion of Canada’s energy needs, i.e., if efficient and economically viable conversion technologies were available to exploit it. Our analyses suggest that certain biomass residues may be more suitable for CH4- or H2-production than others. While woody non-stem residues could, theoretically, produce the greatest amount of CH4 energy, energy recovery via CH4-production from biosolids and agricultural crop residues may be more efficient (both approximately 42%) than for other biomass residues such as livestock manure (approximately 36% efficiency) and OMSW (approximately 30% efficiency). Further studies with actual processing trials would be required to confirm these possibilities. Energy recovery via H2-production appears to have the highest potential with woody non-stem and wood product residues (approximately 9%), followed by agricultural crops, OMSW, and biosolids (approximately 8%), with H2 energy recovery from livestock manure being the least efficient (approximately 5%). Once again, actual process trials would be required to confirm these potentials. Our assessments indicate that CH4-production from biomass is a more efficient energy conversion technology than is H2-production. Despite the fact that H2 has the highest gravimetric heating value of all fuels (142GJ/t), its density is low (0.09kg/m3), resulting in a low volumetric heating value (0.0127GJ/m3). While the gravimetric heating value of CH4 is lower than that of H2 (55.6GJ/t), its density is greater (0.72kg/m3), resulting in a much higher volumetric heating value (0.040GJ/m3). The ratio of volumetric heating values of CH4 to H2 is 3.15 and thus more energy will be derived per m3 of CH4 than for H2. Moreover, the apparent yields for CH4 synthesis (0.225–0.475m3/kg substrate) are greater than those for H2 (0.193–0.287m3/kg substrate). While it could be concluded that conversion of biomass residues to CH4 yields higher energy, only cellulosic materials and non-cellulosic sugars were included in our calculations of H2-production. Other cellular components, like lipids and proteins, which can constitute up to 30% of the TS in some biomass sources, such as municipal biosolids, were not counted because of the absence of reliable conversion data. H2-production is also often more rapid than CH4-production with only 6–10h required to convert sugars to H2, as opposed to up to 10–15 days for CH4-production. It is also important to note that a renewable source of high value and clean H2 could have specific merits in relation to renewable fuel stock for fuel cells etc., thus favoring its production over CH4. Additionally, anaerobic fermentation systems that combine both H2- and CH4-production technologies, for example in a sequential manner, are under development (International Energy Agency, 2004b), and further research and development might improve overall (combined) energy yields from biomass. There are, however, several limitations to the development of biomass residues as an immediate energy resource. Foremost is the fact that current anaerobic digestion technologies are not sufficiently efficient to recover usable energy at a cost that is currently competitive with fossil fuel technologies. If we are to utilize biomass as a bio-energy resource, substantial improvements in the efficiency of energy recovery will have to be made, or additional value-added benefits related to waste diversion or GHG mitigation will have to developed to make these processes more economically viable. Another key factor in the development of biomass residues as energy resources is the distributed or dispersed nature of some types. Large sources of biomass residues are often located at a distance from potential energy production sites. A significant amount of livestock manure, as much as 25–35% of the total residues, may remain un-recoverable in the field (Woods and Layzell, 2003). The collection, transport, and processing of biomass residues also pose a significant challenge to their use in energy production. Biomass feedstocks used for power generation in the United States, in order of increasing costs, include urban wood residues, wood processing residues, agricultural crop residues, forestry residues, and energy crops. The costs of these feedstocks are directly proportional to the costs of collection and transportation to energy production sites (Overend, 2002). With fossil energy sources eventually dwindling and becoming increasingly more expensive, bio-energy systems are likely to have future attraction. The improvements in fermentation system yields obtained from better preprocessing and recovery techniques would also help improve their viability in general. Additionally, valuing the collateral avoidance of biomass residue-related environmental problems, such as municipal waste landfill GHG emissions, as achieved through utilizing MSW, can also influence sustainability of bio-energy approaches. With these various points in mind, which biomass residues can currently offer the greatest practical potential for energy production in Canada? While it is clear that additional research is required to improve the efficiency of energy production by anaerobic fermentation processes, certain biomass residues offer the potential for significant energy using existing technologies. MSW and biosolids are produced in large amounts in urban areas with high energy needs, and thus, could provide usable energy on a sustainable basis to some communities. Large livestock feedlots close to urban centers also offer a potential for co-digestion of manure with OMSW and/or biosolids, producing usable energy and value-added fertilizer, as well as reducing their environmental problems, as associated with large hog and cattle feedlot operations and landfill disposal of MSW. In closing, we acknowledge that our analysis has some limitations. Energy required for the production of biogases (substrate pre-treatment, purification of the biogas, reactor maintenance, manpower, etc.) was not accounted for in our calculations. These energy requirements are strongly affected by the collection, transportation, pre-treatment, and gas-purification methods used and the scale of the biogas production plant in terms of operating costs. Nonetheless, our analyses provide useful data that can be used in prioritizing biomass residues for further analysis, research and exploitation, as well as identifying geographical regions where these may have higher significance. The significant potential bio-energy yields shown here through utilizing microbial technologies for existing and otherwise unused biomass resources supports the establishment of a focus on this area, including additional research and development on conversion technologies and the creation of commercial incentives to encourage the industrial development of this potential."
