0,Introduction,"Micro-reformers fed by light alcohols for the onboard hydrogen production have recently attracted much attention due to the growing fuel cell technique and the related industry [1–3]. The reformers can conduct the steam reforming (SR) reaction [4–6]. When oxygen is introduced into a SR reaction system (Oxidative Steam Reforming, OSR), the conversion of raw materials can be enhanced significantly, and the coke deposition can be suppressed [7–9]. If the reaction is maintained only by the heat generated by the oxidation reaction, the process is named as auto-thermal reforming (ATR): C2H5OH+(3−2δ)H2O+ δO2 →2CO2 +(6−2δ)H2 (δ ≥0.61, ΔH ≤0). Compared with SR and OSR reactions, micro-reformers based on the ATR reaction are more effective and compact because no external heat supply is needed. Thus, the reaction turnover of the ATR reaction can be 10–100 times higher than that of SR [10,11]. The ATR of ethanol (ATRE) for hydrogen production is environment-benign, because ethanol can be produced by the fermentation of renewable biomass. Since the ATRE is carried out at higher temperatures (typically 500–800°C), one of the challenges is the stability of catalyst used, which has to resist the coke deposition and thermal-sintering. The ceria-promoted Rh/Al2O3 catalyst has been reported as an efficient and stable catalyst in ATRE reaction [10]. Our recent works presented that the relatively low-cost Ir/La2O3 catalyst can be used as an effective ATRE catalyst [12] with good resistance to the sintering and coking [13]. On the other hand, since the ATR reaction is kinetically faster than its SR counterpart, the mass transfer, hot spot and pressure drop limitations have to be carefully engineered. An effective solution is to coat the catalyst on the surfaces of microchannel [14,15], monolith [16–19], foam [17,18,20–22] and macroporous silicon [23] to form a structured catalyst with a uniform layer of catalytic coat with thickness in the range of 10∼100μm. Dietrich et al. [24] have reported that the pressure drop of ceramic foam is very low (in the range of several mbar per meter). However, the intrinsic catalytic behaviors of the catalyst coats are potentially influenced by the substrate comprised of metals or oxides, because of the strong interaction between metal and oxide at high temperatures [7,25]. In this paper, we present the fabrication of a structured Ir/La2O3 catalyst for ATRE reaction. Ceramic foams were selected as the support of Ir/La2O3, due to their improved mass transfer [20] and thermal-stability. Our previous work [13] showed that the excellent activity, selectivity and stability of Ir/La2O3 catalyst origin from an in situ dispersion effect of Ir on support caused by the strong metal-support-interaction. When the foam is introduced to support the catalyst, the following requests have to be satisfied: (i) the support is inactive for the decomposition or dehydration of ethanol, which result in coke deposition; (ii) the in situ dispersion effect is maintained to ensure a similar performance to the powder catalyst; and (iii) the resultant structured catalyst possesses enough adherence strength. In this work, Al2O3, SiC and ZrO2 foams were employed to develop structured catalysts. The effects of foam materials and La content on the ATRE performance were investigated. A micro-reformer with hydrogen production that can power a fuel cell on 800W scale was fabricated with the optimal structured catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The powder La2O3 and ZrO2 supported Ir catalysts were prepared by impregnating iridium precursor (IrCl3 nH2O, Ir content: 54.51wt%, Shanghai July Chemical Co., Ltd., China) on La2O3 and ZrO2 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) [12]. The Ir loading was fixed at 4.8wt%. The resulting powder catalysts were denoted as Ir/La2O3 and Ir/ZrO2, respectively. A washcoating method was used to prepare the structured catalyst, as described in detail elsewhere [21]. The ceramic foams employed included ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiC (25 pores per inch, Feite material Co., Ltd., Foshan, China). During the screening of catalyst composition and foam materials, the ceramic foams were firstly crashed into pellets with size of 2–3mm. Prior to coating, the ceramic pellet/foam was cleaned by distilled water and acetone to remove salts and organic contaminants. The clean pellet/foam was immersed into a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution followed by drying at 110°C overnight. The resulting pellet/foam was calcined at 500°C for 2h to decompose the nitrate. The loadings of lanthanum were selected at 2–30wt%. The La2O3-coated pellets/foams were then impregnated in a 5wt% aqueous solution of iridium, followed by drying and calcining at 500°C for 2h. The loading of Ir was 4.8wt%. The resulting catalyst was denoted as Ir(4.8)–La(x)/CF, where x refers to the loading of lanthanum, and CF refers to the pellet/foam employed."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The mechanical properties of coated ceramic foams were characterized on the aspect of adhesion stability. The foams were exposed in a 250W ultrasonic bath in distilled water for 1–30min to evaluate the adhesion strength of catalyst on the foams. H2 chemosorption experiments were carried out in an Auto Chem II chemisorption Analyzer. 0.2g sample was firstly reduced at 500°C with 10v% H2/Ar (50cm3/min) for 40min. After purging with He for 30min, the sample was cooled down to 50°C. The adsorption of hydrogen was carried out by pulsing H2/Ar (20cm3/min) and monitored by a TCD detector. The particle size can be calculated by: d =6 M/(6.02×1023 ρσD), where d is the diameter of Ir particle in nm, M the relative molecular weight of Ir (192.22), ρ the density of Ir (22.5g/cm3), σ the occupied area of a Ir atom (∼0.01nm2), and D the dispersion defined as the fraction of surface atom. The acidities of supports were evaluated by NH3-TPD technique. In each measurement, 0.15g support was charged into a tubular quartz reactor. The smaples were pretreated at 200°C for 1h in helium flow 20ml/min to remove the physisorbed water and organic molecules. The chemisorbtion of NH3 was carried out at room temperature with NH3 at 5ml/min until saturation, followed by flushing with helium flow at 5ml/min for 1h to remove the physisorbed NH3 molecules at 50°C. The temperature-programmed desorption profiles were recorded by a TCD detector from 30 to 800°C with a ramping rate of 10°C/min."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The ATRE performance of the structured catalyst was evaluated in a home-made micro-reformer, as shown in Fig. 1 . The reformer was fabricated by stainless steel. The gasified ethanol and water and air were fed and mixed in the inlet of the reformer, and were subsequently introduced to the catalytic foam with 40mm in diameter and 20mm in length. In this work, no any distributor was used in the inlet to reduce the size of reactor. Two thermocouples were placed at the inlet and outlet to monitor the temperature evolutions. The temperature signal was collected by a computer through a multiple-channel thermocouple input USB module (Advantech, USB-4718). A circular electrical heater was placed around the reformer to provide heat during the reduction of catalyst. The reactor was thermally insulated with quartz wool. In a typical ATRE reaction, the catalyst was activated by hydrogen of 50ml/min at 500°C for 80min prior to the ATRE reaction. A mixture of ethanol and water was then fed into a preheater at 250°C by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 8ml/min. Air was introduced at room temperature. The molar ratio of ethanol:oxygen:water was 1:0.83:2. The gas hourly space velocity was 4.8×104 h−1, corresponding to a contact time of 71g-catalyst-coating min/mol-EtOH. The start-up and shut-down can be repeatedly operated by supplying and suspending the feed of reagents. Since the temperature of the auto-thermal reactor is dependent on the catalyst activity and selectivity, the properties of different catalysts have to be compared under controlled temperatures. Thus, the catalyst screening was carried out in the form of pellet in a quartz fixed-bed reactor under OSRE reaction condition, namely at a fixed reaction temperature of 650°C. Typically, 0.2g catalysts were sandwiched by quartz wool and packed in the reactor. A K-type thermocouple was inserted into the center of the catalytic bed to monitor the reaction temperature. The catalytic OSRE reaction was performed with the same procedure as that in ATRE reaction, except that the flow rate of EtOH-H2O mixture was 0.1ml/min and vaporized at 140°C. The molar ratio of ethanol:oxygen:water was 1:0.83:3. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 5×104 h−1. The reformate gas was analyzed by an Agilent 6820 GC equipped with Haysep (for the analysis of CO2, C2H4, ethanol, acetaldehyde, water, and acetone), 13× molecular sieve (for H2, N2, CO, CH4,) packed columns and TCD detector. N2 from the feed air was used as the inert standard to calculate the mass balances. The carbon balances of GC analysis were within 100±8%. The ethanol conversion and product selectivity were calculated by: X Ethanol = F Ethanol,in − F Ethanol,out F Ethanol,in , S H 2 = F H 2 out ( 6 − 2 δ ) × F Ethanol,in × X Ethanol , S i = m × F i,out 2 × F Ethanol,in × X Ethanol , where F is the normal flow rate, and m is the number of carbon atoms in a product molecular. δ is the stoichiometric number of O2."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of support on the performances of the Ir–La catalyst,"3.1 Effect of support on the performances of the Ir–La catalyst Before fabricating the structured catalysts, the catalyst composition was screened in terms of foam materials and the La loading. To simplify the experiments, the screening was carried out over pellets from the foams in a packed bed to simulate the situation in a structured catalytic reformer. Fig. 2 compares the OSRE performances of the powder Ir/La2O3 and Al2O3, SiC and ZrO2 supported Ir–La catalyst pellets at 400–700°C. The OSRE on Ir/La2O3 produces H2, CO2, CO and CH4 as main gaseous products. C2H4O was detected at lower temperatures, indicating that the dehydrogenation reaction took place. The selectivity of H2 increased progressively from 56.7% to 69.3% with temperature from 450 to 700°C, because the steam reforming of methane was enhanced at higher temperatures. The CO selectivity increased with temperature due to the suppressed water-gas shift (WGS) reaction at higher temperatures. The ethanol conversion slightly decreases on all of the ceramic foam supported catalysts compared to the powder Ir/La2O3, meanwhile, the H2 selectivity was also decreased on the foam-supported catalysts, indicating the influence of support on the catalyst activity. Among the foams used, the ZrO2 supported catalyst provided slightly higher conversion at lower temperatures. Over Ir(4.8)–La(15)/Al2O3 and Ir(4.8)–La(15)/SiC, the H2 selectivity significantly declined with the decreasing temperature from 64.8% to 33.8% and from 61.9% to 38.2%, respectively. A large amount of CH4 and C2H4O were formed over Ir(4.8)–La(15)/Al2O3, showing that the catalyst is not active enough for methane reforming and acetaldehyde decomposition reactions. Compared with Ir(4.8)–La(15)/Al2O3 and Ir(4.8)–La(15)/SiC, the H2 selectivity of Ir(4.8)–La(15)/ZrO2 is much higher at lower temperatures. When the temperature decreased from 700 to 450°C, the H2 selectivity varied from 61.7% to 54.7%, indicating that Ir(4.8)–La(15)/ZrO2 may be suitable for ATRE in a wide range of temperature. Above results show the strong dependence of catalytic property on the foam materials. In terms of conversion and H2 selectivity, the ZrO2-foam supported catalyst provides better performances. The widely used Al2O3 foam [10,11,17,18] is not optimal for supporting the Ir/La2O3 catalyst in ATRE. The acidity measurements for the Al2O3 and ZrO2 support indicated that the strong NH3 desorption took place at about 100 and 450°C over Al2O3 used in this work, while almost no NH3 desorption was detected over ZrO2, as shown in Fig. 3 . The acid sites of Al2O3 could contact with reactants or interplay with the catalyst layer to induce the dehydration reaction, although a barrier layer of La2O3 is precoated over the Al2O3 foam. Youn et al. [26] have also demonstrated that the too strong acidity of support is detrimental for the H2 yield. On the other hand, ZrO2 is active in adsorbing and dissociating steam [27], leading to the higher activity of reforming methane compared with Al2O3."
7,Effect of La loading on the performance of Ir(4.8)–La(x)/ZrO2,"3.2 Effect of La loading on the performance of Ir(4.8)–La(x)/ZrO2 According to Fig. 2, the selectivity to hydrogen on Al2O3, SiC and ZrO2 supported Ir–La catalysts was in the following order: ZrO2 >SiC>Al2O3. Subsequently, the loading of La was optimized to improve the performance. Several studies [28,29] have shown that the dispersion of metal is influenced by the La loading on La–Al2O3 in the ethanol/methane reforming reaction, therefore very different reaction performances have been obtained over the catalysts with different La loadings. Fig. 4 shows the Ir crystallite size of the reduced Ir–La/ZrO2 pellet, measured by H2 chemisorption, as a function of the La loading. The Ir particle size in Ir/ZrO2 was about 14.5nm, agreeing well with that from TEM observation, (16.6nm, not shown). A particle size value of 14.9nm was achieved in Ir/La2O3, indicating that the dispersion of Ir is similar between the pure La2O3 or ZrO2 supported catalysts. As La was introduced, the mean size of Ir particles dramatically decreased. The minimum was obtained at a La loading of 8wt%. As further elevated the La content, the particle size increased. Aforementioned results indicate the strong interaction among iridium, lanthana and zirconia foam. The reduction of metal (Ni, Pt, etc.) particle size caused by the introduction of lanthanum on support has been reported by several researches [28–32]. The strong interaction between the active metals and lanthanum species and the formation of complexes, such as LaNiO3, La2NiO4, (LaPt x O)Pt0, are responsible for the reduction of the metal particle size. We have previously reported that Ir can react with lanthanum species to form Ir doped lanthanum dioxycarbonate during the OSRE reaction [13]. The fact that the minimum of Ir size occurs at a proper La loading indicates that the ZrO2 foam probably participates in the solid state reaction. As the La loading increases to >8%, the lanthana barrier layer will shield the ZrO2 foam to participate in the interaction. On the current stage, the details about the interaction among Ir, La and ZrO2 is not clear yet. Except for the effect of La loading on Ir crystalline size, the addition of La species might also change the acidity of support. For instance, Youn et al. reported that the performance of auto-thermal reforming of ethanol could be correlated with support acidity with a volcano curve [26]. We measured the acidity of ZrO2 with and without precoated lanthana layer, as shown in Fig. 3. Within the typical temperature window of NH3 desorption (100–450°C), there was no any desorption peak on ZrO2, indicating that the ZrO2 used in this work is neutral or has extremely weak acidity. After addition of La, the strong peaks at about 450 and 700°C can be attributed to the release of CO/CO2 due to the decomposition of lanthanum dioxycarbonate formed via the reaction: La2O3 +CO2 ↔La2O2CO3, as demonstrated by our previous work [12,33]. Around 100–200°C, the typical NH3 desorption temperature, there are not noticeable peak in the TPD profiles of La(8)/ZrO2 and La(15)/ZrO2. These results suggest that the support acidities of ZrO2 with or without La loading are very weak, therefore the effect of support acidity is unlikely to play a dominant role in our study. Fig. 5 shows the effect of La loading on the OSRE performance over the Ir(4.8)–La(x)/ZrO2 pellets. The OSRE result of Ir(4.8)–La(15)/ZrO2 pellet is replotted to compare the results more conveniently. The conversion of ethanol decreases with the increasing La content under the same conditions when the La loading is higher than 8wt%. Although the conversions of Ir(4.8)–La(2)/ZrO2 and Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellets are closed, the highest selectivity to hydrogen is obtained over Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2. Complete conversion of ethanol can be obtained on the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellet at 650°C with a selectivity to hydrogen of 80.5%. The selectivity is higher than that on Ir(4.8)/La2O3 catalyst (68.4%), indicating the improved performance can be obtained by optimizing the catalyst composition. Further decreasing or increasing the La loading will decrease the hydrogen selectivity. This result is consistent with the effect of the La loading on the dispersion of Ir on the La(8)/ZrO2 support, suggesting that the optimal performance probably origins from the high dispersion of active sites. The aforementioned catalyst screening demonstrates that the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 is the optimal catalyst in our investigation in terms of activity and H2 selectivity. A further investigation was focused on the stability of the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellets in the OSRE reaction. In our previous study [13], we have proved that the Ir crystallites on La2O3 can be in situ dispersed during the OSRE reaction via the formation of Ir doped La2O2CO3. This effect can inhibit the sintering of active sites, therefore improve the OSRE reaction activity and stability. Fig. 6 shows the Ir crystallite sizes of the powder Ir/ZrO2 and the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellets measured by H2 chemisorption as a function of time on stream. The particle size at the beginning of reaction is represented by that of the reduced sample. After the reduction, the Ir particle size in Ir(4.8)/ZrO2 was about 14.5nm. It slightly decreased to 14.1nm after 3h OSRE reaction. The size of Ir crystallite over the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellets decreased significantly from 8.6 to 5.6nm during the first three hours of OSRE reaction, then increased gradually within the next 33h. After 36h OSRE, the size of Ir crystallite was only 6.8nm, which was smaller than that of the reduced sample. These results indicate that Ir can be well dispersed without sintering after 36h OSRE at 650°C on the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellet. As shown in Fig. 7 , the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 pellets are stable with a time-on-stream of 200h without noticeable drop of conversion and H2 concentration in gaseous product."
8,The ATRE performance of the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 foam,"3.3 The ATRE performance of the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 foam Aforementioned results demonstrate that Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 is the most effective catalyst for the OSRE reaction among the catalysts employed. A micro-reformer (see Fig. 1) was constructed using the ZrO2 ceramic foam with the catalyst composition. For the purpose of on-line hydrogen production, the reactor should be thermoneutral, compact, resistable to shock and quickly responsive. The blank ZrO2 foam is yellowish. It turns to black after coating the catalyst layer. The adhesion strength of catalyst layer coated on ZrO2 ceramic foam was tested by a strong vibration of ultrasonication. As shown in Fig. 8 , after a sonication for 1min, the peeling off of the catalyst layer was insignificant as the liquid was quite clear. Elongating the sonication time to 2min would peel off a part of the catalyst as the liquid turned to cloudy. However, the weight loss of catalyst due to the sonication is about 0.1wt% after 30min sonication (from 24.26g to 24.23g), indicating that the structured catalyst exhibits good adhesion strength, allowing for working with the violent shocks [21]. The auto-thermal operation was smoothly achieved in the ethanol-reformer with the procedure ascribed in the experimental section. Fig. 9 shows the repeated start-up and shut-down (RSS) operation using the outlet temperature as an indicator. In a typical start-up and shut-down cycle, the temperature firstly drops after the reagents are introduced, due to the cooling effect of reagents. Then, the exothermic oxidative reaction elevates the outlet temperature to 580–630°C within about 90s, meanwhile the hydrogen-rich gas is produced. Subsequently, the temperature slowly ascends, because the longer time is needed to achieve thermal-equilibrium due to the low thermoconductivity of ceramic. In this work, the end of the rising-edge of the temperature response is used as an indicator of the ignition point of the ATRE reactor, though the constant temperature distribution has not been established at this point. By counting the time between feeding the reagents and the ignition point, it was found that only ∼90s were used to start the ATRE reaction, as shown in the inset of Fig. 9. The start-up time and reaction temperature have no change after the RSS operation for 19 cycles, indicating that the reformer is quite stable on the aspect of the transient start-up characteristic. Fig. 10 shows the ATRE performance of the reformer with the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 foam in the RSS and continuous mode as a function of time. The reformer was firstly operated in the RSS mode with 19 cycles as ascribed in Fig. 9, and then was operated with continuously feeding for 6h. It produced H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and C2H4O as main gaseous products with an ethanol conversion of ∼92%. There were no obvious changes of the conversion and selectivities during either the RSS or the continuous operation, indicating that the structural catalyst developed in this work is stable for the ATRE reaction. The average H2 selectivity among 13h was 73.4%. Correspondingly, the H2 yield per molecular ethanol was about 3.1mol/mol EtOH, very close to the thermodynamical equilibrium value [34]. This hydrogen production can supply a steady and bright flame in outlet, as shown in the inset of Fig. 10. Aforementioned results demonstrate that the compact reformer of ethanol can be successfully fabricated using the structural Ir/La2O3 catalyst. The high hydrogen yield and good performance in a dynamic RSS operation allow it for a candidate for a unit of the future on-board hydrogen production system. In total 13h of ATRE reaction, the catalyst foam was stable and no obvious coke observed. In this work, the average hydrogen flow rate of the reformer was about 0.41m3/h, which can approximately supply a PEMFC in the power output level of ∼765W (95% H2 utilization, 50% efficiency) [1]. To achieve this, the development of a purifying unit for the hydrogen rich gas is ongoing in our group."
9,Conclusions,"The structured Ir/La2O3 catalysts for the hydrogen production via the autothermal reforming of ethanol were prepared by impregnating ceramic foams. The screening of foam materials and La loading indicate that the ZrO2 foam is the most suitable support among the foam ceramic employed (Al2O3, SiC and ZrO2), and the optimal composition of the structured catalyst is Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2. The La content in the catalytic layer significantly influences the initial Ir dispersion, therefore influences the OSRE performance, such as ethanol conversion and H2 selectivity. The in situ dispersion effect of Ir on the structured catalyst was also demonstrated, which probably improved the activity and stability of catalyst. A micro-reformer based on the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 catalytic foam was fabricated. The ATRE reaction was carried out in either the RSS or continuous mode for middle-term. Typically, the reformer produces 3.1mol H2 per mol ethanol, with a hydrogen flow rate of ∼0.41m3/h. The results in this paper indicate that the Ir(4.8)–La(8)/ZrO2 foam may be used to fabricate a promising reactor for the hydrogen production for the portable fuel cell usage."
