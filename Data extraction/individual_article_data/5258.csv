0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes into their corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UA) is not only of commercial interest in the production of fine chemicals, but also of special scientific interest [1]. Thermodynamics and kinetics both favor the hydrogenation of the CC bond over the CO bond on conventional hydrogenation catalysts that are based on Pt, Ru, Pd or Ni [2]. Catalysis by Au supported catalysts has shown a remarkable higher selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the conjugated CO groups in unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation compared with the conventional catalysts mentioned above [3]. However, Au is usually much less practical in catalytic applications than platinum-group metals due to the “intrinsic” nobleness of Au for H2 activation [4]. Great efforts have been made to elevate the catalytic activity of Au, such as carrying a more active metal on Au-based catalysts. Such modified catalysts may show unexpected catalytic features [5]. For example, Xu showed that the activity of Au/SiO2 was enhanced remarkably (1–2 orders of magnitude higher) after it was impregnated with a small amount of Pt [6]. However, the selective propensity of Au NPs favors the hydrogenation of the CC with respect to the CO bond (21% selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the CO bond for cinnamaldehyde). Catalytic activity may also be enhanced by reducing the particle size of Au NPs. It was found that the hydrogenation turnover frequency (TOF) over Au/TiO2 was significantly increased when Au particle size decreased from 8.7 to 1.7nm [7]. The higher TOF exhibited by smaller Au particles may be associated with an increased capacity to activate or dissociate hydrogen [8]. However, the selectivity towards UA may increase as the Au particle size increases. This effect was demonstrated by the calcination of 5wt.% Au/ZnO between 250 and 400°C in which the crotyl alcohol selectivity increased dramatically (from 54% to 81%) with an increase in Au particle size [9]. Therefore, carrying a more active metal on Au-base catalyst is more desired to improve the total activity of the catalyst, while keeping the high selectivity unchanged. With the goal to enhance the catalytic activity of Au, we proposed Ir as a promoter, as the formed Au–Ir surface alloy can dissociate molecular hydrogen more readily than noble metals [10]. In the present work, TiO2-supported Au–Ir catalysts were prepared by the deposition–precipitation (DP) method with the loading of Au and Ir to be 1.75wt.% and 0.25wt.% respectively. We examined the catalytic performance of Ir promoted Au/TiO2 in the selective reduction of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamyl alcohol (COL). In-depth characterization of their structural and electronic properties by TEM, XPS and UV–vis techniques aimed at disclosing the nature of the active sites controlling the hydrogenation rate of CALD."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Au/TiO2 (2wt.% Au) catalysts were prepared by the DP method using ammonia. The advantage of using ammonia was to control the pH more easily and to avoid the formation of residues produced from other bases [11] and it has been successfully applied in obtaining Au supported catalysts with a small particle size in a recent study [12]. TiO2 (Degussa, P25, specific surface area of 50m2 g−1, 80% anatase and 20% rutile) was added to the aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (0.05gmetal/mL) at a fixed pH (8.0) adjusted by ammonia (4.98N solution). Subsequently, the samples were filtered, washed by distilled water, then dried and calcined at 400°C for 4h. Finally, they were reduced in H2 stream at 400°C for 4h. The Ir promoted Au/TiO2 catalysts (0.25wt.% Ir) were also prepared by DP with ammonia. The calcined Au/TiO2 (1.75wt.% Au) was added to the aqueous solution containing HIrCl4 (0.035gmetal/mL) and ammonia. The suspension was maintained at 80°C and vigorously stirred for 12h. Subsequently, the samples were filtered, washed and dried before being calcined at 400°C for 4h. Au–Ir/TiO2 catalysts were finally produced by being reduced in H2 stream at 400°C for 4h. The same procedures were used to prepare Ir/TiO2 (2wt.% Ir) catalysts."
3,Catalyst characterization,2.2 Catalyst characterization The microstructure and components of the NPs were examined by TEM (Philips-FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin). XPS analysis was performed by Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer with monochromatized aluminum X-ray source (1486.6eV) and the pass energy of 40eV. The pressure in the sample analysis chamber was lower than 6×10−9 Torr during data acquisition. The C1s peak at 284.8eV arising from adventitious carbon was taken as reference for correcting surface-charging effects. This reference gives binding energy values a precision of ±0.02eV. The Au and Ir loadings of the catalysts were measured by ICP-MS (Thermo Electron IRIS Intrepid II XSP spectrometer). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra of the solids diluted in BaSO4 were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2450 Spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere and BaSO4 was used as the reference.
4,Typical procedure for the hydrogenation of CALD,"2.3 Typical procedure for the hydrogenation of CALD Hydrogenation reactions were performed in a high-pressure batch reactor equipped with a Parr 4871 controller and a 50-mL Hastelloy autoclave. Unless otherwise specified, the autoclave was loaded with 20mL of 2-propanol/H2O (4/1 volume ratio), 0.3g of CALD, and 0.15g of catalyst. The reactions proceeded at the required experimental conditions (see Table 1 ) after the autoclaves were purged by hydrogen to remove the air. Only CALD, hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL) and COL were detected as the reaction products and were quantified by using n-heptane as the internal standard substance, and the carbon balance value of 100%. The conversion and selectivities were calculated using the following formulas: (1) Conversion CALD = 1 − m CALD % m CALD % + m HCAL % + m COL % + m HCOL % × 100 % (2) Selectivity COL = m COL % m COL % + m HCAL % + m HCOL % × 100 % (3) Selectivity HCAL = m HCAL % m COL % + m HCAL % + m HCOL % × 100 % (4) Selectivity HCOL = m HCOL % m COL % + m HCAL % + m HCOL % × 100 % (5) Reaction rate h − 1 = m CALD m Au + Ir × conversion / time h where mCALD, mHCAL, mHCOL, and mCOL represent the moles of cinnamaldehyde, hydrocinnamaldehyde, hydrocinnamyl alcohol, and cinnamyl alcohol in the mixture. mAu+lr is the moles of Au and Ir used in the reaction."
5,Results and discussion,"TEM images in Fig. 1a and d show that Au nanoparticles (NPs) for Au/TiO2 and Au–Ir/TiO2 were both well dispersed with the support of TiO2 with an average size of about 8.7nm (Fig. 1c) and 9.7nm (Fig. 1f) respectively. The HRTEM images show that the lattice spacing of the Au/TiO2 sample is 0.235nm, which is indicative of Au (111) plane (Fig. 1b). However, for the Au–Ir sample (Fig. 1e), the lattice spacing is 0.231nm, which is between that of the Ir (111) plane (0.219nm) and the Au (111) plane (0.235nm), indicating the formation of the surface Au–Ir alloy. However, Ir particles were not found in the TEM image possibly due to the low loading, or their existence in Au–Ir alloy species. UV–vis spectra (Fig. 2 ) of the Au–Ir sample confirmed the Ir deposition on Au NPs, as evidenced by the decreased Au NP surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak intensity compared with pure Au NPs [13]. Ir content of the samples detected via ICP-MS was close to the nominal value (0.25wt.%). Fig. 3A shows the XPS spectra of Au 4f core level of Au/TiO2 and Au–Ir/TiO2. The metallic Au 4f7/2 peak of the Au/TiO2 sample appeared at the binding energy (BE) of 83.8eV similar to the reported value [14]. For Au–Ir/TiO2, the Au 4f7/2 peak was detected at a lower BE value of 83.4eV. The Ir 4f spectra of the Au–Ir/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3B. Because the Ir 4f peak was overlapped with the Ti 3s peak, and the fact that the signal of Ir 4f for the catalyst with low Ir loading (0.25wt.%) is quite weak even through the prolonged accumulating time, a precise deconvolution of the Ir 4f orbit from those spectra is difficult. Therefore, the Ir 4f7/2 signal is not deconvoluted into the two spin orbit component doublet, but is deconvoluted into Ir0 and Irδ+ peaks. This deconvoluted method has been adopted by W. Lin et al. in 2013 [15]. It was found that the peak which corresponds to Ir0 4f7/2 was at 61.4eV, 0.5eV higher than the standard BE of 60.9eV [16]. This suggests the electron transfer from Ir to Au atoms, confirming that the electronic structure of the surface Au atoms was modified upon the addition of Ir. Likewise, a few of the previous reports on Au–Pd systems with a “crown-jewel” structure had claimed that there is electron transfer from Pd to Au clusters and confirmed the electronegativity of the above-mentioned Au atoms [17,18]. The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the Au 4f7/2 peak was also given in Fig. 3A. The narrow FWHM (1.05eV) obtained for Au/TiO2 catalysts revealed that there was only metallic Au which existed in this sample. Nevertheless, the FWHM obtained for Au–Ir bimetallic catalyst is about 1.50eV. Since full width at half maximum of the Au peak is large, the presence of more than one Au species is expected, indicating that Au–Ir alloys are probably formed on the surface of bulk Au NPs. The experimental results for the hydrogenation of CALD over each catalyst were summarized in Table 1. We can see that the major product over both Au/TiO2 and Au–Ir/TiO2 catalysts was COL, produced via CO bond hydrogenation with >83% selectivity. For the Ir/TiO2 catalyst, however, the selectivity of COL was only 55.6%. Although Au/TiO2 showed a quite high selectivity (83.8%) towards the COL, only 8.6% conversion was obtained after reacting for 4h, implying low activity of Au in the hydrogenation process. In comparison, the conversion of CALD reached 12% over Au–Ir/TiO2 catalyst after reacting for 1h, and the reaction rate of Au–Ir/TiO2 catalyst (17.7h−1) was 5-fold higher than that of Au/TiO2 catalyst (3.2h−1). Thus, a small amount of Ir (0.25wt.%) could enhance the activity of Au/TiO2 catalyst remarkably. The course of the hydrogenation of CALD over Au–Ir/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 4a. The amount of COL increased with the reaction time during the hydrogenation of CALD over Au–Ir/TiO2, while the amount of HCAL increased to a maximum before decreasing. The completely reduced product of HCOL increased gradually. The conversion of CALD and the selectivities of products are shown in Fig. 4b. The selectivity of HCAL decreased whereas that of HCOL increased with the conversion. But the selectivity of COL was maintained at about 75% before the complete conversion of CALD. Evidently, Au–Ir/TiO2 as a stable catalyst can deliver high selectivity at good conversion. As mentioned previously, the activity of the Au–Ir/TiO2 was 5 times higher than that of Au/TiO2 catalyst. Therefore, an interpretation is needed to illustrate such catalytic behaviors. In fact, Au is not miscible with Ir; however, Au–Ir can form near-surface alloys and has shown promising results for hydrogen-related applications [10]. Some near-surface alloys bind atomic hydrogen as weakly as the noble metals while retaining an ability to dissociate molecular hydrogen more readily than the noble metals [19]. Interestingly, the gold films on Ir (111) were able to dissociate molecular hydrogen [20]. The formed hydrogen atoms on Au/Ir (111) recombinatively can desorb at low temperatures (<400K), suggesting that hydrogenation chemistry can be catalyzed by Au/Ir bimetallic nanoclusters/surfaces [20]. Moreover, the dissociative adsorption behavior of hydrogen on the surface of Au–Ir can be explained by changes in the surface electronic structure. The XPS results in the current work indicated that the electronic structure of the surface Au atoms was modified upon the addition of Ir. Therefore, it is evident that the significant improvement of the catalytic activity of Au–Ir/TiO2 catalyst was highly related to the strong interaction between Au and Ir atoms which enhanced the electron density at the surface of Au. Indeed, the presence of Auδ− species for Au catalysts which may enable Au NPs to function as better hydrogenation catalysts than Au0 has been reported before [21–23]. A more recent study using Au catalysts also claimed that the presence of negatively charged gold species formed at the surface of Au NPs improves the H2 activation [24]. Thus, the formation of the negatively charged gold species might be one of the key factors for improving the catalytic activity of Au–Ir catalysts. As for the high selectivity of Au–Ir/TiO2 to COL, the key factor would be the electronic property of the Au0 species, which might alter the interaction with carbonyl carbon. The XPS results clearly showed that the binding energy of the Au0 and Ir0 species shifted to lower and higher values respectively, suggesting a charge transfer from Ir to Au. This enhanced electron density over the Au0 species is believed to be beneficial for the selectivity to COL, since it would lead to a lower binding energy of the CO bond with respect to the CC bond, favoring the hydrogenation of the CO bond [25]. More specifically, it was found that the preferential binding between the labile electrophilic carbon in the carbonyl group and negatively charged gold species would favor a high selectivity to unsaturated alcohols [22]. Moreover, the electropositive Ir atoms may act as electrophilic or Lewis acid sites for the adsorption and activation of the CO bond. This effect, referred to as the “electrophilic CO activation”, was the most frequently invoked to account for the promoting effect of electropositive species [26]. Based on the above results, we propose a hypothesis for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over Au–Ir/TiO2 catalyst in Fig. 5 . The charge-deficient carbonyl carbon is believed to be adsorbed on the negatively charged gold species, and meanwhile, the charge-rich carbonyl oxygen is adsorbed on the electropositive Ir atoms. In this way, the CO bond will be preferentially hydrogenated over the CC bond, leading to the high selectivity of Au–Ir/TiO2 to COL. In addition, according to the adsorption model of CALD, the CC bond and the CO bond are more likely to be adsorbed simultaneously on the small Au particles compared to the large Au particles. On large metal particles, the adsorption of the CC group is hindered by a steric repulsion thus favoring hydrogenation of the CO group [27]. In our work, the size of Au NPs as estimated by TEM increased from 8.7nm to 9.7nm when a small amount of Ir was added, which is probably also a reason for the observed high selectivity to COL."
6,Conclusions,"Both Au/TiO2 and Au–Ir/TiO2 were found to be able to catalyze the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol with high selectivities (>83%). However, the specific hydrogenation rate of Au–Ir/TiO2 was 5 times higher than that of Au/TiO2. The high activity of Au–Ir/TiO2 catalyst might be attributed to the promoted H2 activation capacity of Au as a result of the strong interaction between Au and Ir in surface Au–Ir alloy and the electron transfer from Ir to Au. The high selectivity to UA could be mainly ascribed to the enhanced interaction between the charge-enriched Au sites and the charge-deficient carbonyl carbon and the interaction between electropositive Ir atoms and electrophilic carbonyl oxygen."
