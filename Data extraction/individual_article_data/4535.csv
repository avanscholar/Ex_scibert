0,Introduction,"Glyoxylate is an attractive raw material for chemical synthesis of vanillin, antibiotics or agrochemicals. It is further utilized as an additive agent for modifying polymers. Although glyoxylate is now produced by chemical synthesis using nitric acid oxidation from glyoxal, the chemical synthesis requires a large amount of neutralizer and produces by-products such as oxalate. In order to overcome these drawbacks of the chemical method, a biochemical method for glyoxylate production was developed using a glycolate and a glycolate oxidase from plants as a catalyst [1–3]. This method was applied under relatively mild reaction conditions, and it produced a higher yield of glyoxylate and fewer undesirable by-products. Therefore, a switch from the chemical synthesis to the enzymatic production of glyoxylate is preferable to overcome the problems described above. However, the biochemical methods still have the disadvantages that glycolate is used as a starting material and the glycolate oxidases are obtained from plants. Thus, the combination of ethylene glycol and microbial oxidases would be useful for enzymatic production of glycolate, because ethylene glycol is much cheaper than glycolate and microbial enzymes are easily produced. In the enzymatic production of glyoxylate from ethylene glycol, there are two pathways from ethylene glycol via glycolate or glyoxal (Fig. 1 ). In the conversion of ethylene glycol to glyoxal, it was revealed that alcohol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.13) from methylotrophic yeast and glycerol oxidase from Aspergillus japonicas oxidized ethylene glycol into glyoxal via glycolaldehyde [4,5]. The oxidation of ethylene glycol has also been reported using the alcohol oxidases from Aspergillus ochraceus AIU 031 [6] and Penicillium purpurescens [7]. Subsequently, we found that an alcohol oxidase from Paenibacillus sp. AIU 311 [8] oxidized glycolaldehyde into glyoxal, and the aldehyde oxidase from Pseudomonas sp. AIU 362 catalyzed the conversion of glyoxal to glyoxylate [9]. With respect to another pathway, the conversion of ethylene glycol to glycolate, it was reported that ethylene glycol-oxidizing microorganisms such as Acetobactor [10], Gluconobacter [11], and Hansenula [12] accumulated glycolate in media with ethylene glycol. Furthermore, Kataoka et al. screened and isolated microorganisms, Pichia naganishii AKU 4267 and Rhodotorula sp. 3Pr-126, which produced high concentrations of glycolate in media containing high concentrations of ethylene glycol [13]. It would be assumed that these microorganisms have enzymes which catalyze the conversion of ethylene glycol into glycolate via glycolaldehyde, although those enzymes have not been purified and characterized. In the conversion of glycolate into glyoxylate, glycolate dehydrogenase from Trichoderma harzianum AIU 353 [14] and glycerol oxidase from A. japonicus [5] to catalyze the conversion reaction. In addition, it is well known that various glycolate oxidases (EC 1.1.3.15) from many green plants and mammalian livers catalyze this conversion reaction. The glycolate oxidases have been isolated from a variety of sources, such as spinach [15], sugar beet [16], pea [17], pumpkin [18], cucumber cotyledons [19], lettuce [20], tobacco [21], rat liver [22], chicken liver [23], and human liver [24]. The X-ray crystal structures of the glycolate oxidases from spinach [25] and human liver [26] have been determined. Regarding microorganisms, genes encoding the subunits of glycolate oxidase (glc DEF) from Escherichia coli have been identified, but their enzymatic properties have not been characterized in detail [27]. Among these glycolate oxidases, the glycolate oxidase from spinach has been used for the enzymatic production of glyoxylate [1–3]. However, the microbial glycolate oxidase was not reported. We therefore screened for an oxidase that would catalyze the conversion of glycolate into glyoxylate but not the conversion of glyoxylate into oxalate. The present paper describes the identification of the isolated strain and certain properties of oxidase using the purified enzyme."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Sodium glycolate, glyoxylate monohydrate, and 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazine hydrochloride (MBTH) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) was obtained from Amano Enzyme (Nagoya, Japan). All other chemicals used were the highest grade that is commercially available."
3,Isolation of microorganisms,"2.2 Isolation of microorganisms The enrichment culture was carried out three times using a screening medium containing 5% 1,2-propanediol, which has a similar structure to glycolate, 0.2% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.1% NaH2PO4·2H2O, 0.02% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01% CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.05% yeast extract (pH 6.0). The microorganisms were cultivated on an agar plate of the screening medium at 30°C for 2–3 days. The formation of hydrogen peroxide was detected by using the color development solution described below in Section 2.4. The isolated strains were incubated in a test tube (16×1.5cm diameter) containing 5ml of the screening medium at 30°C for 3 days. Subsequently, cell-free extract was prepared by disrupting the cells at below 5°C for 8min by a Multi-beads shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan). The strain exhibiting high activity toward glycolate but not toward glyoxylate was selected and used in this study."
4,Identification of the isolated strain,"2.3 Identification of the isolated strain Identification of the newly isolated strain was performed at NCIMB Japan Co., Ltd. (Shizuoka, Japan)."
5,Cultivation of the isolated strain,"2.4 Cultivation of the isolated strain The isolated strain was incubated in 5ml of the 1,2-propanediol medium containing 1% 1,2-propanediol, 0.2% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.1% NaH2PO4·2H2O, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.02% CaCl2·2H2O, 0.5% corn steep liquor, and 0.05% yeast extract (pH 6.0) at 30°C for 2 days with shaking (120 strokes/min). The culture (1ml) was inoculated into a 500-ml culture flask containing 150ml of the 1,2-propanediol medium, then incubated at 30°C for 3 days with shaking. A volume of 40ml of the second culture was transferred into a 3l culture flask containing 2l of the 1,2-propanediol medium, then cultivated at 30°C for 3 days with shaking."
6,Glyoxylate production from glycolate by resting-cell reaction,"2.5 Glyoxylate production from glycolate by resting-cell reaction Approximately 13g (wet cell weight) of resting cells from the isolated strain harvested after 3 days of cultivation in 1,2-propanediol medium were incubated with 1.0M glycolate in 15ml of 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 20°C for 14 days. Glyoxylate in the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC with an ULTRON PS-80H column (Shinwa Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan). The elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1.0ml per min at 60°C with perchloric acid solution (pH 2.1) for 20min. The elution peaks of glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate were eluted at 8.8min, 7.2min, and 5.3min, respectively, under the same experimental conditions."
7,Enzyme activity assay,"2.6 Enzyme activity assay Oxidase activity was assayed by measuring the formation rate of hydrogen peroxide at 30°C. The reaction mixture was composed of 1ml of a solution containing 50μmol of glycolate, 0.6μmol of 4-aminoantipyrine, 1.94μmol of N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3-methylaniline sodium salt dihydrate, 6.7 units of peroxidase, 0.1mmol of potassium phosphate (pH 5.5), and an appropriate amount of enzyme solution. The formation of hydrogen peroxidase was spectrophotometrically measured by following the increase in the absorbance at 555nm. One unit of enzyme activity was determined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of one micromole of hydrogen peroxidase per minute under the conditions above."
8,Purification of the enzyme,"2.7 Purification of the enzyme All the procedures were performed at 5–10°C using potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The cells from 20l of culture broth (128g of wet weight) were disrupted with glass beads in 10mM buffer solution by a Multi-beads shocker, and the supernatant (1.5l) collected by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 30min was used as a crude enzyme solution. Then, solid ammonium sulfate (363g) was added to the crude enzyme solution to reach 40% saturation with stirring, and the formed precipitates were removed by centrifugation. Two hundred grams of Phenyl-Toyopearl 650M resin equilibrated with 10mM buffer solution containing 3M ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and it was stirred for 4h. After the supernatant was removed, the resins bound to the enzyme were washed using 1l of 10mM buffer solution containing 3M ammonium sulfate for 3h. The adsorbed enzyme was eluted with 10mM buffer solution containing 0.5M ammonium sulfate, and the amount of ammonium sulfate was increased to reach 50% saturation with stirring. The supernatant (250ml) was collected by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 40min, and dialyzed against 10mM buffer solution. The dialyzed enzyme solution was applied onto a GigaCap Q-Toyopearl 650M column (19×3cm diameter) equilibrated with 30mM buffer solution containing 50mM NaCl. The adsorbed enzyme was then eluted with a linear gradient of 30mM buffer solution containing 50mM NaCl and 180mM NaCl (650ml each). The active fractions were collected and dialyzed against 10mM buffer solution, and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (18×1.8cm diameter) equilibrated with 0.2M buffer solution, and the adsorbed enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2M and 0.4M buffer solution (225ml each)."
9,SDS-PAGE and molecular mass measurement,"2.8 SDS-PAGE and molecular mass measurement The sample for SDS-PAGE was incubated with 1% SDS and 5% mercaptoethanol at 100°C for 3min. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli [28]. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme was estimated by SDS-PAGE using the molecular marker standards of Bio-Rad Japan (Tokyo, Japan). The molecular mass of the intact protein was estimated by gel filtration on a TSK gel G3000SWXL column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan)."
10,Identification of reaction products,2.9 Identification of reaction products Two hundred millimolars of glycolate was incubated with 1.75mg of the purified enzyme in 0.6ml of 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) at 20°C for 6h. The aldehyde group of the reaction product was then analyzed according to the MBTH method using 50μl of the reaction mixture [4]. The reaction products were also analyzed by HPLC with an ULTRON PS-80H column. The concentration of glyoxylate was calculated by peak area. The method of HPLC analysis is described in Section 2.5. The formation of H2O2 was also identified by the method of enzyme activity.
11,Glyoxylate production from glycolate,2.10 Glyoxylate production from glycolate Six hundred millimolars of glycolate was incubated with 1.75mg of the purified enzyme and 100m units of catalase in 0.6ml of 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 20°C for 24h. The concentration of glyoxylate in the reaction products was measured by the method of HPLC analysis described in Section 2.8.
12,Cofactor analysis,2.11 Cofactor analysis The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme was measured by a UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800). The iron concentration was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (Shimadzu ICPE spectrometer-9000) under a radio frequency power of 1.2kW and plasma gas flow rate of 10.0l/min.
13,Analysis of N-terminal amino acid sequences,2.12 Analysis of N-terminal amino acid sequences The N-terminal amino acid sequences of two subunits were determined using a Shimadzu gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with an on-line reverse-phase chromatography system for identification of PTH-amino acids.
14,Results,
15,Identification of the isolated strain,"3.1 Identification of the isolated strain The selected strain was identified by biochemical properties and phylogenetic analyses. The isolated strain was non-fermentative, motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped (0.6–0.7×1.5–2.0μm), Gram-negative, catalase-positive, and oxidase-positive. The analysis of the 16S rDNA-full sequence showed that 97.9% of the sequence of this strain was identical to that of Ochrobactrum anthropi [29]. In the phylogenetic analysis among closely related strains, the 16S rDNA sequence of the isolated strain formed a cluster with that of Ochrobactrum gallinifaecis (95.7% identity) [30]. The biochemical properties were also in agreement with the properties of the genus Ochrobactrum. We therefore concluded that the selected strain belongs to the genus Ochrobactrum, and named it Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033, which is kept at Department of Biological Chemistry and Food Science, Iwate University, Japan."
16,Glyoxylate production from glycolate by resting-cell reaction,"3.2 Glyoxylate production from glycolate by resting-cell reaction Cells of Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 were incubated with 1.0M glycolate at pH 6.0 and 20°C for 14 days, and the supernatant of the reaction solution was subjected to HPLC analysis with an ULTRON PS-80H column. The new peak was detected at around 7.2min, which was identical to the elution time for glyoxylate, and 0.33M glyoxylate was produced after 14 days of incubation (data not shown)."
17,Effect of cultivation time on enzyme production,"3.3 Effect of cultivation time on enzyme production Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 was incubated with the 1,2-propanediol medium at 30°C for 4 days, and the glycolate oxidase activity and cell growth were measured each day (Fig. 2 ). The glycolate oxidase activity reached the maximum after 3 days of cultivation, while the cell growth continued to increase."
18,Purification and molecular mass of the enzyme,"3.4 Purification and molecular mass of the enzyme The purified enzyme was obtained from the crude enzyme solution with an overall yield of 2.4%, and it exhibited a 100-fold increase in specific activity (Table 1 ) The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 4.0m units/mg of protein and showed a single protein band on native-PAGE (Fig. 3A), and two protein bands with molecular masses of 52kDa and 14kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated to be 130kDa on a TSK gel G3000SWXL column. These results indicated that the enzyme might be composed of an α2β2 structure, in which the α subunit is 52kDa and the β subunit is 14kDa."
19,Cofactor analysis,"3.5 Cofactor analysis The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme solution exhibited absorption maxima at around 275, 380, and 450nm (Fig. 4 ), indicating that this enzyme might contain flavin as a prosthetic group. Then, the purified enzyme solution was incubated at 100°C for 3min to dissociate a flavin, and its supernatant was applied to TLC on silica gel with two solvent systems to identify the prosthetic group. However, the flavin compounds were not detected on the TLC analysis (data not shown). This result indicated that the flavin cofactor covalently bound to the enzyme. Spectrometric analysis with a Shimadzu ICPE spectrometer-9000 revealed the presence of two iron atoms per enzyme protein. Thus, the enzyme was a flavoprotein containing iron atoms."
20,Substrate specificity and kinetic values,"3.6 Substrate specificity and kinetic values The enzyme oxidized glycolate, lactate, and primary alcohols such as ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol, but not glycolaldehyde, ethylene glycol, glycerol, glyoxylate, methanol, or benzyl-alcohol (Table 2 ). In these substrates, the oxidation rate of glycolate was faster than that of lactate, ethanol, and 1-propanol, but slower than that of medium and long chain primary alcohols (C4–C10). The effects of substrate concentration on the enzyme activity were analyzed using glycolate, lactate, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol (Table 3 ). The K m value for glycolate was higher than that for lactate and primary alcohols such as 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol. The V max value for glycolate was higher than that of lactate, but it was not significantly different from those for 1-octanol and 1-decanol, and it was 3-fold lower than that for 1-pentanol. These results indicated that the enzyme prefers longer chain alcohols such as 1-octanol and 1-decanol. The plot of the initial rate against the concentrations of ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol formed a sigmoid curve, not a hyperbolic curve like that of the Michaelis–Menten equation."
21,Reaction products of glycolate oxidation,"3.7 Reaction products of glycolate oxidation Reaction products were prepared by incubation of 0.2M of glycolate and approximately 1.75mg of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 20°C for 6h. The MBTH derivative 1 of the reaction product from glycolate exhibited absorption maxima at around 350, and the derivative 2 showed absorption maxima at around 610 and 680nm (data not shown). These spectrums were the same as the typical MBTH spectrum of glyoxylate [4]. When the reaction mixture was applied to HPLC analysis, the new peak was detected at around 7.2min, which was identical to the elution time for glyoxylate, but oxalate was not detected. Furthermore, the formation of 29.5μmol of H2O2 and 26.2μmol of glyoxylate was confirmed when the above incubation was terminated at 30min. We therefore concluded that the enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate, but not the oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate. The reaction mixture containing 0.6M glycolate, 1.75mg of the purified enzyme, and 0.1 units of catalase was incubated at pH 5.5 and 20°C, and the reaction mixtures at 6, 12, and 24h of incubation were applied to HPLC analysis. In these analyses, two peaks were detected at 7.2min and 8.3min, which were the elution times for glycolate and glyoxylate, respectively, but the peak at 5.3min, which was the elution time for oxalate, was not recognized. The concentrations of glyoxylate in the reaction for 6h, 12h, and 24h were estimated to 2.1mM, 3.5mM, and 6.8mM, respectively (Table 4 )."
22,Effects of compounds on enzyme activity,"3.8 Effects of compounds on enzyme activity The effects of compounds on the glycolate oxidase activity were assayed by addition of 1mM of carbonyl reagents, chelating reagents, metals, or other chemicals (Table 5 ). Metals did not affect the enzyme activity. Addition of hydroxylamine and iodoacetic acid decreased the enzyme activities to 72% and 59%, respectively. In addition, phenylhydrazine strongly inhibited the enzyme activity, indicating that the carbonyl group was concerned in the enzyme activity."
23,Effects of pH and temperature,"3.9 Effects of pH and temperature The effect of pH on glycolate oxidase activity was assayed under standard assay conditions, except that the reaction pH varied between 5.0 and 8.5. The maximal activity of glycolate oxidation was obtained at pH 5.5 (Fig. 5A). The pH stability was analyzed by incubating at 25°C for 20min in the pH range from 5.0 to 8.5. More than 80% of the enzyme activity remained in the pH range from 5.5 to 6.5 (Fig. 5A). The effect of temperature on the glycolate oxidase activity was assayed at pH 5.5. The highest activity was obtained at 45°C (Fig. 5B). When the enzyme was incubated at 20–50°C for 20min at pH 5.5, more than 80% of the enzyme activity remained below 35°C (Fig. 5B)."
24,N-terminal amino acid sequence,"3.10 N-terminal amino acid sequence The N-terminal sequences of the 52kDa subunit and 14kDa subunit were found to be A A P Y D L K D D K V V V I I G S G A G G G T L G N E L A Q and L E T A T L K P E T M A T L I Q L A R D I Y P H D K L P D R, respectively. The sequence of the large subunit had high similarity to that of the putative glucose–methanol–choline oxidoreductase from Ochrobactrum anthropi ATCC 49188 (97% identity) [31], Burkholderia gladioli BSR3 (88% identity) [32], Pseudogulbenkiania sp. NH8B (84% identity) [33], and the putative 2-keto-gluconate dehydrogenase from Roseobacter denitrificans OCh 114 (72% identity) [34] (Fig. 6A). The flavin-binding motif of GXGXXG was confirmed in the N-terminal positions 16–21. The sequence of the small subunit also had high similarity to the N-terminal sequences of the hypothetical proteins from O. anthropi ATCC 49188 (97% identity) [31], Pseudogulbenkiania sp. NH8B (64% identity) [33], and R. denitrificans OCh 114 (73% identity) [34] (Fig. 6B)."
25,Discussion,"We isolated Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 for production of glyoxylate from glycolate, and revealed that the strain produced the enzyme catalyzing oxidation of glycolate into glyoxylate. Therefore, we purified the enzyme and revealed its properties. The enzyme showed oxidase activity for glycolate and primary alcohols with C2–C10, but not for glyoxylate. The V max/K m values for primary alcohols with the C5–C10 chain were significantly higher than those for α-hydroxyl acids such as glycolate and lactate, and 1-decanol had the best value among the primary alcohols tested. These results indicated that the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 belongs to the group of alcohol oxidases. The N-terminal amino acid sequence also supported this classification, because the sequences of the 52kDa and 14kDa subunits showed high similarity to that of putative glucose–methanol–choline oxidoreductases (Fig. 6). It is well known that the alcohol oxidases belonging to the glucose–methanol–choline oxidoreductase family show activity for short chain, medium chain, or allyl alcohols [35]. Therefore, we compared the properties of the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 with those of glycolate oxidases, glycerol oxidase, and alcohol oxidases (Table 6 ). Glycolate oxidases from plants and human liver oxidize glyoxylate as well as glycolate. Glycerol oxidase from A. japonicus also oxidized glycolate, and it preferred ethylene glycol or glycolaldehyde to glycolate. However, the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 showed no activity for glyoxylate, ethylene glycol, or glycolaldehyde. In addition, there has been no previous report that alcohol oxidase catalyzed the oxidation of glycolate. Thus, the substrate specificity of the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 was significantly different from those of microbial alcohol oxidases or those of the enzymes with glycolate-oxidizing activity reported in previous studies. With respect to the physiochemical properties, the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 was composed of two different subunits (52kDa and 14kDa), whereas glycolate oxidases and most alcohol oxidases act as monomers or homomultimers (Table 6). The small subunit would contain a twin-arginine translocation (TAT) pathway signal for export or secretion [36], because N-terminal amino acid sequence of the small subunit of Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 shows high similarity with that of the hypothetical protein of O. anthropi ATCC 49188 (Fig. 6), which has a motif of TAT pathway signal in N-terminal region. In addition, the genes encoding the putative glucose–methanol–choline oxidoreductase and the hypothetical protein of O. anthropi ATCC 49188 exist next to each other, and are oriented in the same direction in the genomic DNA. Thus, it can be inferred that the small subunit contributed to export the enzyme in Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033. Regarding cofactor species, the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 was a flavoprotein containing iron atoms, and the flavin cofactor covalently bound to the enzyme. Glycolate oxidases from plants and human liver contain FMN, and the short-chain alcohol oxidases (SCAO) from Pichia pastoris and A. ochraceus AIU 031 contain FAD, which non-covalently bound to the enzyme. There have been no reports of iron atoms in these oxidases. Polyvinyl alcohol oxidases (PAO) from Pseudomonas vesicularis [37] and Pseudomonas sp. [38] have iron atoms, but they are not flavoproteins. In the enzymatic properties, the optimum pH of the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 (pH 5.5) was lower than that of glycolate oxidases from plants (pH 7.5–8.5), glycerol oxidase from A. japonicus (pH 7.0), SCAO (pH 6.0–8.5), long-chain alcohol oxidase (LCAO) (pH 6.0–9.5), and PAOs (pH 10). Furthermore, the optimum temperature of the enzyme from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 was 45°C, which was higher than that of glycerol oxidase (40°C), SCAO (20–30°C and 37°C), LCAO (20–30°C), or PAO (40°C). Thus, the enzyme found in present study has unique properties in terms of its structure, cofactor species, N-terminal amino acid sequence, optimum pH, and optimum temperature, compared with other alcohol oxidases. We therefore concluded that it would be a novel type of alcohol oxidase with glycolate-oxidizing activity. The HPLC analyses of reaction products showed that the alcohol oxidase from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 accumulates glyoxylate with time (Table 4), which indicated that the enzyme might be certainly concerned in the conversion of glycolate into glyoxylate in the resting cell-reaction of Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033. In addition, the oxalate was not detected under the experimental conditions used in this study, which was advantageous for glyoxylate production. The methods of glyoxylate production from glycolate using glycolate oxidase from spinach, which had a K m value for glycolate of 0.38mM, were developed by Seip et al. [1–3]. The K m value of the alcohol oxidase from Ochrobactrum sp. AIU 033 was 167mM, which was much higher than that of glycolate oxidase from spinach. This higher K m value would become advantageous for incubation with a high concentration of glycolate. We therefore expect that the alcohol oxidase found in this study has the potential to be useful for the enzymatic production of glyoxylate, although the observed productivity of the enzyme from the original strain (approximately 2%) was not sufficient for short-time reaction. Thus, in the future, cloning of the full-length enzyme gene and DNA sequence analysis must be performed in order to obtain a recombinant strain that overexpresses the enzyme gene."
