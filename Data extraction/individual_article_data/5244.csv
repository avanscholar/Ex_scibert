0,Introduction,"As one of the high-efficient, environment-friendly and renewable green energy sources, hydrogen has been committed to addressing the global issues, including the increasing depletion of fossil energy and fierce environmental contamination. Recently, electrochemical splitting of water (H2O → H2 + O2) yielding hydrogen and oxygen has attracted tremendous attentions [1–3]. Currently, due to the specific electronic structure and two-dimensional (2D) layered features, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is considered as one of the most promising candidates for the noble Pt-based electrocatalysts to effectively improve the activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the highly exposed active sites [4–8]. MoS2, one of the burgeoning layered transition metal chalcogenides that is analogous to 2D graphene, possesses unique and remarkable electrical, chemical, mechanical and thermal performances [9–12]. As one of the representative transition-metal dichalcogenide materials (MX2, wherein M stands for transition metal elements i.e., Ti, Zr, Nb, V, Mo, W, while X represents chalcogen elements such as S, Se, or Te), MoS2 consists of the laminar S–Mo–S structure with weak van der Waals interactions between the adjacent layers [13,14]. Typically, MoS2 is prepared in its thermodynamically stabilized phase of 2H polymorph which exists in the construction of a laminar hexagonally stacked framework with a structure of vertically aligned layered MoS2 films [15]. In general, the stable (002) planes are the preferentially exposed planes in MoS2 flakes, whereas only the localized active sites on the edge play a pivotal role in catalyzing hydrogen evolution, resulting in the low electrochemical catalytic efficiency [16]. To surmount this shortcoming, comprehensive researches and efforts have been conducted for the improvement of HER activities especially on the synthesis of MoS2 with a large number of uncovered active sites. And two admitted well-developed strategies as follows have been carried out extensively: (i) increasing the conductivity of MoS2 catalysts through the phase modulation [17–19]. The active sites of the 2H–MoS2 with a semiconductor property are distributed at the sulfur edges only, whereas the active sites of the metallic 1T phase with an octahedral structure locate at both edge and basal planes that have inherent advantages for HER process [7,20]. Nevertheless, the 1T-MoS2 is liable to be easily converted into the 2H–MoS2 [21]. Researchers have made tremendous efforts on the preparation of 1T-MoS2 through the conventional intercalation/extraction (Li+, K+, Na+) pathways [22]. The intercalated ions extend the interlayer distance of MoS2 and further reduce the Vander Waals' force between the neighbor interlayers, which makes it effectively exfoliate into the 1T phase. Ambrosi et al. designed exfoliated 1T-MoS2 nanosheets with a better conductivity by using tert-butyllithium intercalant [23]. Lukowski's group synthesized MoS2 in a home-built CVD reactor and then treated it with n-butyl lithium to attain a 1T-MoS2 structure [24]. However, the hazardous reaction process must be conducted in a high vacuum environment (e.g., glove box), which is complicated and time-consuming [25]. (ii) increasing the electron transfer of 2H–MoS2 by fabricating a morphological structure with conductive materials (e.g., graphene, amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, etc.), defects, disorders and the expanded interlayer spacing. Recent researches have shown preliminary achievements [26–33]. Wang et al. produced amorphous MoS2 nanoflowers with an expanded interlayer (0.8 nm) by hydrothermal methods, which exposed more active sites and reduced the intrinsic resistance [34]. Gao's group synthesized a new MoS2 nanostructure with an expanded interlayer of 0.94 nm through a microwave heating strategy to make it become a highly competitive catalyst towards HER [35]. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate the effective MoS2 with more active sites via a straightforward pathway, especially for the fabrication of 1T-MoS2 with an expanded interlayer spacing. Herein, we highlight a universal and facile hydrothermal approach to synthesize the interlayer-expanded 1T/2H–MoS2 nanospheres. And it is accessible to fabricate the MoS2 with the adjustable morphology and structure by controlling the hydrothermal temperatures. Firstly, 1T-MoS2 was successfully prepared using Na2MoO4·2H2O and NH2CSNH2 via a handy hydrothermal method at the temperature of 160 °C. Furthermore, to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2, SiO2 was exploited to disperse the agglomerated MoS2 nanospheres (Scheme 1 ). By controlling the hydrothermal reaction conditions, the regular flower-like precursors with different interlamellar spacings of (002) planes were obtained at a temperature range of 160–200 °C. Afterward, the Na+/H+ ions intercalated MoS2 nanospheres were collected after the treatment of NaOH and HF solution, respectively. The structure was based on bilayer hydrates that can accommodate Na+ or H+ [36]. Conspicuously, the optimal product of Na+ intercalated 1T-MoS2 nanospheres with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.95 nm obtained at 160 °C achieved an overpotential of 255 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the fast kinetics revealed by a fairly small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1. Besides, further investigations on electrochemical activity surface area and electrochemical impedance have confirmed the electrochemical energetics and mechanisms."

Silicon dioxide (SiO2, 99%) was obtained from Aladdin reagent, China. Nafion solution (10 wt%) was purchased from DuPont, USA. The water (18 MΩ cm−1) used in all experiments was prepared by an ultrapure purification system. All reagents were used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis of MoS2/SiO2 precursor,"2.2 Synthesis of MoS2/SiO2 precursor In a typical synthesis, Na2MoO4·2H2O, NH2CSNH2 and SiO2 as a ratio of 1:4:1.5 were dissolved in 60 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring to form a homogeneous solution. After stirring for 30 min, the suspension was transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves and heated at different temperatures (160 °C, 180 °C or 200 °C) for 24 h, respectively. After naturally cooling down to the room temperature, the mazarine precipitates were collected by centrifugation, filtration with water and ethyl alcohol absolute several times then dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The resulting products were denoted as M/S-160, M/S-180, M/S-200, respectively. For comparison, pristine MoS2 was obtained via a similar synthesis route at the temperature of 160 °C without SiO2 and named as M-160."
4,Synthesis of Na+/H+ intercalated MoS2,"2.3 Synthesis of Na+/H+ intercalated MoS2 The achieved samples were treated with NaOH or HF (aq.) under room temperature to etch the SiO2 nanospheres, followed by filtration, washing with water several times and drying at 60 °C. The final products were marked as Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180, Na-M/S-200 and H-M/S-160, H-M/S-180, H-M/S-200 after NaOH or HF infiltration, respectively."
5,Characterization,2.4 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα-source with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) as the X-ray source in the 2θ range from 3 to 80° at a scan rate of 4° min−1 with a step of 0.02°. A Nova NanoSEM 450 was used to investigate the morphology of the samples. Structural features were characterized by the High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) on an FEI Talos F200S with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained from an AXIS supra electron spectrometer with an Al Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Raman measurements were performed on a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. ICP-AES was conducted on 213DF0G/ICPE-9820 spectrometer.
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements of various electrocatalysts were performed on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a typical three-electrode system. A carbon bar and Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl solution) electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. To prepare the working electrode, a homogeneous catalyst ink was made by mixing 4 mg of catalyst, 30 μL of 10 wt% Nafion solution and 1 mL of water-isopropanol solution (3:1), and putting into a sonication bath for at least 30 min. Then 5.2 μL of the dispersion (containing 20 μg of catalyst) was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode with a 3 mm diameter (loading ca.0.285 mg cm−2). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 under a violent stir velocity of 1600 r/min to remove generated H2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 10−2 Hz ∼ 106 Hz with an AC voltage of 5 mV. Prior to any electrochemical measurement, the electrolyte solution was purified with N2 for 1 h to remove completely the oxygen, and electrodes were cycled at least 50 cycles."
7,Results and discussion,"The general view of flower-like MoS2 nanospheres is detected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Apparently, after the NaOH treatment, Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200 show uniform and independent spherical structure (Fig. 1 a–c). No adhered nanoparticles are observed on the spheres, indicating that the SiO2 had been dissolved by NaOH. Besides, the sizes of Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200 nanospheres are increasing from ∼1 μm to ∼2 μm accompanying the increased reaction temperature, indicating that the high temperature accelerates the growth of MoS2 nanospheres. In addition, the pristine MoS2 without any treatment (in Figure S1a and b) indicates the spherical MoS2 is composed of the small nanosheets and plentiful SiO2 particles attached to the surface of MoS2 nanospheres. The as-synthesized samples without SiO2 (Figure S2a) are unevenly distributed with an agglomeration which is detrimental for electrochemical performance. Analogously, the MoS2 obtained at different temperatures are also treated by HF solution, and the as-synthesized MoS2 nanospheres hold a similar architecture (Figure S2b-d) with the precursors treated by NaOH. The inner structure of MoS2 has been inspected through High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) analysis. As displayed in Fig. 1d, the trigonal lattice of Na-M/S-160 corresponds to a crystal structure of octahedral coordination which is attributable to the 1T-MoS2 [37,38]. The top-right inset in Fig. 1d shows the interlamellar spacing of (002) plane is ∼0.95 nm which probably due to the intercalation of Na+. Obviously, the trigonal lattice and honeycomb lattice in Fig. 1e are corresponding to the 1T phase and 2H phase in Na-M/S-180, respectively. Furthermore, the Na-M/S-200 sample exhibits a honeycomb lattice structure (Fig. 1f) possibly assign to the 2H phase, which forms a hexagon with three Mo atoms and three overlapped S atoms [39]. The top-right inset in Fig. 1f reveals a ∼0.64 nm lattice spacing which can be identified with (002) plane of 2H–MoS2. In conclusion, with the increase of temperature from 160 °C to 200 °C, the MoS2 transformed from 1T to 2H phase. According to the elemental mapping distributions of Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200 in Fig. 1g–i, it is visible that Na+ is evenly distributed on MoS2 nanosheets, indicating that Na+ was successfully inserted into the interlayer of MoS2. Additionally, the content of Na+ reduces with the increasing hydrothermal temperature, it may be ascribed to the phase transition from 1T to 2H. And the Na+ ions in Fig. 1i may be attributed to the adsorption of Na+ on the surface of MoS2 nanospheres. The phase and structure evolution of various MoS2 treated by NaOH were examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig. 2 a. For 1T-MoS2 obtained at 160 °C with the distensible interlamellar spacing of ∼0.95 nm caused by the insert of sodium hydrates in Fig. 2ai, the sharp peaks at ∼9.3° and ∼18.6° are corresponding to (002) and (004) planes of MoS2 [40,41]. With the augment of the temperature to 180 °C (Fig. 2aii), a new peak around 14.2° suggests the emergence of the 2H–MoS2. With further increase temperature to 200 °C, the peaks around 14.2°, 33.0°, 38.3˚ and 58.9° in Fig. 2aiii are indexed to the (002), (100), (103), (110) planes of 2H–MoS2, respectively [28]. Visibly, the (002) plane of MoS2 changes from ∼0.95 nm to ∼0.64 nm with the increasing temperature ascribes to the evolution of the 1T to the 2H phase for MoS2. The deficiency of the diffraction peak located at ∼9.3° accompanying the increasing temperature from 160 °C to 200 °C indicates the decreasing concentration of Na+ ions in the interlayer spacing which is further attested by the results of ICP in Table S1. The possible reason for the generation of 2H-phase at 200 °C is that the Na+ ions are de-intercalated at high temperature, whereafter the 1T phase converted into the 2H phase. Besides, the sample synthesized at 160 °C without SiO2 and NaOH/HF treatment (Figure S3i) also shows an interlaminar spacing of 0.95 nm, which may be attributed to the remain Na+ (Table S1) between layers of MoS2 derived from incompletely reacted Na2MoO4·2H2O at the low temperature, leading to a distortion in the trigonal prismatic structure of 2H phase [42]. Thus, the 1T structure can be triumphantly fabricated by a one-step and concise hydrothermal method without introducing new cations but only Na+ from Na2MoO4·2H2O. However, the relationship between the interlaminar Na+ and the emergence of the 1T phase still needs to be tested by further experiments and theoretical calculations. For the further modified samples, before the treatment of NaOH solution, the humps in Figure S3ii-iv around 22° are ascribed to the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles. Likewise, the interlayer spacing of (002) plane evolves from 0.95 nm to 0.65 nm and 0.64 nm with the increase of temperature from 160 °C to 200 °C. The hump of 22° disappearing in Fig. 2a indicates that the removal of SiO2 nanoparticles. Compared with the precursors, Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200 show sharper diffraction peaks, manifesting a compact arrangement of the crystalline structure due to the interposition of Na+ from NaOH solution. Moreover, all the MoS2 precursors obtained at different temperatures (160 °C, 180 °C and 200 °C) were treated by the HF solution, and the interlayer spacings shrink into ∼0.66 nm, ∼0.65 nm and ∼0.64 nm (Fig. 2bi–iii), indicating the MoS2 samples were intercalated by H+ ions via the ion exchange with Na+ ions. To verify the insertion of Na+ and H+ ions in the 1T-MoS2, a further ion-exchange procedure was also implemented. Na-M/S-160 was first treated with HF whereafter with NaOH to obtain a sample named Na-M/S-160-HF-NaOH. According to the result in Figure S4, the interlamellar spacing of the prepared MoS2 was extended to ∼0.95 nm, which was consistent with the above-mentioned Na-M/S-160. It demonstrated that the interlaminar H+ ions were successfully exchanged into the Na+ ions. Based on the above-mentioned results, it witnessed that the low temperatures facilitate the generation of 1T-phase. And the flexibility of controlling the interlayer distance can be achieved through different ion exchanges. Raman spectra of 1T- and 2H–MoS2 were shown in Fig. 2c and d. The characteristic Raman peaks in Fig. 2c at 378 cm−1 and 404 cm−1 arising from the in-plane mode E2g 1 and out-of-plane mode A1g respectively are in accordance with the 2H-phase MoS2 [18]. Meanwhile, the other five peaks situated at 150 cm−1, 196 cm−1, 284 cm−1, 336 cm−1 are corresponding to the J1, J2, E1g, J3, and A1g modes in 1T-MoS2 [43]. Therefore, it attests that the phase of the resulting MoS2 converted from 1T-MoS2 to 2H–MoS2 accompanying the increasing temperature from 160 °C to 200 °C. Besides, the proportion of 1T-MoS2 in H-M/S-160, H-M/S-180 and H-M/S-200 (Fig. 2di–iii) decrease with the temperature increases from 160 °C to 200 °C, suggesting the 1T-MoS2 changed into 2H–MoS2. Furthermore, Raman spectra in Figure S5 displays that M-160 hold a structure of 1T-phase. Based on the above-mentioned results, it indicates that the lower temperature favorites the fabrication of the 1T-MoS2. The as-synthesized MoS2 nanospheres were further testified by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in Fig. 2e and f. According to the XPS images of different samples, the binding energies of ∼232.8 eV and ∼229.3 eV are distributed to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 orbitals of 2H–MoS2, thereby indicating the existence of Mo4+ [44]. Besides, two small peaks for Mo5+ and Mo6+ at ∼234.9 eV and ∼236.5 eV may ascribe to the partial oxidization of the MoS2 surface [43,45]. The signals observed at ∼231.9 eV and ∼228.6 eV in Mo 3d XPS is approximately 1 eV lower than that of the homologous 2H–MoS2, corresponding to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 in the 1T-MoS2 [46]. The relevant peaks for the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 orbitals of Na-M/S-160 and Na-M/S-180 have reduced from ∼162.9 ev to ∼162.0 eV and ∼161.1 eV to ∼160.7 eV respectively, revealing the conversion from the 2H to the 1T structured MoS2. According to the XPS analysis, the proportion of 1T-MoS2 for Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200 was estimated to be approximately 75.3%, 49.2% and 0% respectively, further demonstrating it is favorable to synthesize the 1T-MoS2 nanospheres at the lower temperatures (i.e., 160 °C). In addition, the XPS analysis for M-160 and H-M/S-160 in Figure S6 also show 1T-structures and the content of 1T phase is circa 78.3% and 67.6% for M-160 and H-M/S-160, respectively. All the results echoed the above-mentioned XRD and Raman conclusions in Fig. 2. The electrocatalytic HER activities were investigated using a typical three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. All the MoS2-based electrocatalysts were deposited on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes with a diameter of 3 mm (∼0.2 mg cm−2). Ag/AgCl electrode and carbon bar were utilized as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. During the scanning process, the continually rotating working electrode at 1600 rpm was exploited to eliminate the generated hydrogen gas and avoid the diffusion effect. Fig. 3 a exhibits the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the potential range of −0.1 ∼ −0.4 V (vs. RHE). As presented in Fig. 3a, Na-M/S-160 delivers an obvious cathodic current in the low overpotential region at ∼255 mV producing a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable to many previous MoS2-based catalysts obtained via the intricate exfoliation process, CVD method or the multistep synthesis method (Table S2) and is close to the result of Pt/C 20% to a certain extent. Additionally, Na-M/S-160 also shows an improved HER catalytic activity over Na-M/S-180 (∼271 mV) and Na-M/S-200 (∼301 mV), indicating the expanded interlayer spacing for 1T-MoS2 (Na-M/S-160) facilitates the transport of electrolyte and the transfer of electrons and thus accelerates the electrocatalytic HER process. Similarly, the MoS2-based electrocatalysts treated by HF solution hold the same order of the increased overpotential, H-M/S-160 (317 mV), H-M/S-180 (328 mV) and H-M/S-200 (476 mV) in Figure S7a, suggesting the higher content of 1T-MoS2 in the electrocatalysts can yield a higher electrochemical conductivity thereby accelerating the transport of electrons and advancing the HER activity. Tafel plots obtained from the overpotential versus log current density (η vs. log j) can be employed for the quantitative kinetics analysis of the HER process. As shown in Fig. 3b and Figure S7b, the scattered sections of the Tafel plots conforms to the Tafel equation (η = b log j + a, where j stands for the current density and b represents the Tafel slope). Two principle steps have been proposed according to the HER catalytic mechanism in acidic media. The first one is the dominating discharge step (shown in Eq. (1)), and the second one is the electrochemical desorption step (Eq. (2)) or chemical desorption step (Eq. (3)) [31]. The Tafel slope of the as-prepared Na-M/S-160 displays a 44 mV decade−1, which is close to Pt/C 20% and smaller than Na-M/S-180 (49 mV decade−1) and Na-M/S-200 (62 mV decade−1), indicating that the Na-M/S-160 electrode possesses the fastest proton discharge kinetics [4,15]. The low Tafel slope for the as-prepared Na-M/S-160 exhibits that hydrogen production is probably eventuated via the Volmer-Heyrovsky process [47,48]. Tafel slopes for the MoS2-based nanospheres acquired by treating with NaOH are far lower than that of HF solution treated samples (Figure S7b), suggesting the larger lattice distance of the (002) plane and the higher content of 1T-MoS2, the higher efficiency of hydrogen evolution. In addition, in Figure S7a it is apparent that H-M/S-160 shows a smaller overpotential at low current densities and a higher overpotential at high current densities than that of H-M/S-180, indicating that H-M/S-180 may have a weaker binding energy of the key intermediate which limits the adsorption reaction (Eq. (1)). H-M/S-160 has stronger binding energy, which limits the desorption reaction (Eqs. (2) and (3)) [49]. Thus, H-M/S-160 has an excellent ability to activate water at the beginning and H-M/S-180 sample performs better electrochemical activity at high current densities. The results of the Tafel plots in Figure S7b were in accord with the LSV analysis for the various H+ ions intercalated MoS2-based electrocatalysts. (1) H3O+ + e− ⇌ S-Hads + H2O [Volmer step, b ≈ 120 mV dec−1] (2) S-Hads + H3O+ + e− ⇌ H2↑ + H2O [Heyrovsky step, b ≈ 40 mV dec−1] (3) 2S-Hads → H2↑ [Tafel step, b ≈ 30 mV dec−1] The sample prepared at 140 °C showed an overpotential of 310 mV (Figure S8a) and a Tafel slope of 72 mV (Figure S8b), which is inferior to Na-M/S-160. The most likely reason is that the crystallization condition of MoS2 has not been reached at 140 °C, which can be verified in XRD (Figure S8c) that this substance is incompatible with MoS2. Therefore, 160 °C is the optimal temperature for preparing the 1T phase MoS2. To further clarify the influence factors of the superior activity of NaOH/HF treated MoS2, the estimation of the electrochemically active surface (ECSA) of the prepared samples was implemented based on the literature [31]. The electrochemically active surface (ECSA) of each sample was linearly proportional to the corresponding double-layer capacitance (Cdl). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) can be used to estimate the behavior of the double-layer capacitance. In this work, CV was performed at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 mV s−1) in 0.0–0.1 V (vs. RHE). The double-layer capacitance of diversiform samples can be determined from the cyclic area (Figure S9 and Figure S10). The double-layer capacitance is estimated by plotting the ΔJ (J a-J c) at 0.05 V (vs. RHE) against the scan rate, where the slope is twice of Cdl. As presented in Fig. 4 a, Na-M/S-160 exposes the largest Cdl among the Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200. Similarly, H-M/S-160 also shows the largest Cdl among the different MoS2-based electrocatalyst obtained at varying temperatures (Figure S7c), suggesting more active sites in Na-M/S-160 and H-M/S-160 due to the large content of the 1T phase which generates a high conductivity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to further understand the electrode kinetics during the HER process. In Fig. 4b, Na-M/S-160 shows the lowest Rct of 167 Ω, in comparison with 336 Ω of Na-M/S-180 nanospheres, 1431 Ω of Na-M/S-200, and 1689 Ω of M-160. Simultaneously, compared with 1494 Ω, 8794 Ω, 15,980 Ω for H-M/S-180, H-M/S-200 and H-M-160 nanospheres, H-M/S-160 shows the lowest charge-transfer impedance (Rct) of 551 Ω in Figure S7d. Dramatically, Na-M-160 shows a better performance than H-M-160 due to the extended layer spacing of ∼0.95 nm resulting from the facilitating electron transfer because of the lower electrochemical impedance. The lowest Rct value of Na-M/S-160 may be on account of the highest content of edges and basal planes of 1T-MoS2 nanosheets which generates additional conductive channels and thus causes much easier charge transfer and active sites. Besides, the equivalent circuit was used to deeply investigate and understand the impact of EIS on electrocatalytic efficiency. The time constants are shown in the inset in Fig. 4b, one is the high frequency (Hf) time constant, expressed as τ1 (CPEf-Rf), the other one is low frequency (Lf) time constant, expressed as τ2 (CPEdl-Rct). Wherein Rs stands for the solution resistance, CPEf, Rf and CPEdl, Rct represents the capacitance and the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/catalyst interface and catalyst/electrolyte interface [50]. With the assistance of Z-view fitting analysis software, the spectra for 1T- and 2H–MoS2 nanospheres were fitted using time constants in a series model. Generally, one semicircle is displayed in the Lf district or two semicircles are displayed in both the Lf and Hf districts in the Nyquist plot of various electrodes [51]. The Hf semicircle is corresponding to the surface porosity while the Lf semicircle reflects the charge transfer process of hydrogen evolution. Table 1 lists the electrolyte resistance Rs of the solution (0.5 M H2SO4) during the measurement process, the values of different samples are similar, which are between 10 and 20 Ω cm−2. The intrinsic resistance Rf of the samples declines with the descending temperature, where the Na-M/S-160 reveals the lowest resistance of 11.42 Ω cm−2. Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance Rct of Na-M/S-160 also exhibits the lowest resistance of 146.8 Ω cm−2, while Na-M/S-200 shows the largest Rct (1167 Ω cm−2). The significantly reduced Rf and Rct suggest that the charge-transfer can be performed faster in Na-M/S-160 during the HER. In brief, the expanded interlayer distance and more exposed active sites can bring favorable structural and electronic modulations, enabling MoS2 to possess a better holistic conductivity [35]. In addition, the electrochemical activity of Na-M/S-160-HF-NaOH (Figure S11) is similar to that of Na-M/S-160, further demonstrating the similar structure characteristic for Na-M/S-160-HF-NaOH and Na-M/S-160. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the electrocatalytic efficiency of M-160, H-M/S-160 and Na-M/S-160 have been further studied to investigate the effects of interlayer structure and morphology. Na-M/S-160 (255 mV) presents a smaller overpotential than that of M-160 (325 mV) and H-M/S-160 (318 mV). Meanwhile, the lowest Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1 for Na-M/S-160 is superior to the M-160 (65 mV decade−1) and H-M/S-160 (90 mV decade−1) (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the agglomerated structure (M-160) and tiny hydrogen ion intercalation (H-M/S-160) may limit the electrons/electrolyte penetration into the interlamellar spacing between the adjacent MoS2 nanosheets, thereby weakening the electrocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, investigations on electrode kinetics have been exploited by ECSA (Fig. 5c) and EIS measurements (Fig. 5d). The high ECSA further demonstrates that the expansion of Na+ intercalation and uniformly dispersed nanosphere shape facilitate the permeation of electrons/electrolytes in the 1T-MoS2. Besides, the small impedance of Na-M/S-160 (167 Ω) promotes the charge-transfer rate and thus accelerates the release of hydrogen. Therefore, the interlayer expansion caused by Na+ intercalation and dispersive nanospheres leads to better electrocatalytic efficiency. The durability of various samples was also analyzed using a classical I-t curve by performing a continuous HER at a static current density of 10 mA cm−2. The I-t curves in Figure S12 indicate that the overpotentials of all these samples still keep steady even after a long period of 36,000 s. In the meantime, it proves that the existence of a 2H phase with low content can strengthen the stability of the 1T structure. During the measurement, the acicular shape appeared in the time-dependent curves probably can be attributed to the alternate bubble accumulation and bubble release process on the surface of the electrode. Therefore, all the MoS2-based electrocatalysts hold outstanding electrochemical durabilities."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, the 1T- and 2H–MoS2 nanospheres with tunable structure and morphology can be prepared via a facile and convenient hydrothermal approach. The evolution of the structures from 1T- to 2H-phase is controllable by the hydrothermal temperature flexibly. The adjustment of the interlayer distance can be achieved through different ion exchanges. Furthermore, the uniformly dispersed 1T-MoS2 nanospheres with an interlayer spacing of 0.95 nm caused an outstanding electrocatalytic efficiency with the low overpotential of 255 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and the Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution and a high ECSA. The expanded interlayer spacing for Na+ intercalated MoS2 can further optimize its electronic structure and therefore improve the electrocatalytic performance. Thus, these properties enable a facile and controllable strategy for engineering cost-effective HER electrocatalysts on 1T-MoS2 in this investigation. Besides, this particular Na+ intercalated structure may be further beneficial for the research of sodium-ion batteries and hydrogen cell thereby promote the development of renewable energies."
