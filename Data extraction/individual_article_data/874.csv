0,Introduction,"Currently, searching for alternative energy have drawn much attention due to worldwide clean energy demands and energy security issues [1]. Bio-based fuels have shown great potential as alternatives for the carbon-based fossil fuels to alleviate these problems, which is widely explored in both academic and industrial research field [2,3]. In particular, bioethanol has been widely tested and applied as substitute fuel for gasoline, and it has been utilized as gasoline blendstock for internal combustion engine worldwide [4,5]. So far, the bioethanol is mainly produced from fermentation process, which can transform non-edible biomass feedstock to ethanol fuels [6,7]. Whereas, bioethanol still has drawbacks like low capacity density (19.6 MJ/L VS. Gasoline of 32 MJ/L), high hygroscopicity and corrosivity, thus limiting its application in transport fuel area [8]. Therefore, the upgrading of surplus bioethanol to heavier fuel chemicals (e.g., higher carbon alcohols) that can better match diesel engine requirement is highly desired [9,10]. In that case, the heavy alcohols with longer carbon chain, higher energy density, noncorrosive to engine parts, immiscible with water and much closer fuel characteristics to those of diesel, can be applied in drop-in gasoline/diesel with much higher concentration (>16%) than ethanol [11,12]. Non-petrochemical technologies to higher alcohols, such as the ABE fermentation (acetone-butanol-ethanol), is still challenging and also difficult to acquire ideal C4+ alcohol species [13]. But remarkably, the carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling reactions can fulfill the CC bond-forming of small intermediate molecules to obtain the larger ones [14,15]. Thus, directly producing higher carbon alcohols from fermentation bio-ethanol by C–C coupling process has a broad prospect [16]. Bio-ethanol is commonly obtained as fermentation broth with low concentration [17,18], which can be enriched and purified by specific techniques such as distillation, gas stripping and molecular sieves adsorption [19]. Whereas, considering the complexity/costly of such purification process [20,21], directly utilizing the enriched aqueous ethanol (∼50 wt%) as feedstock to produce water-immiscible higher alcohols, thus allowing convenient separation with water, will be much efficient and costless. Generally, the ethanol coupling reaction is an intermolecular dehydration process [9]. Hybrid homogeneous-heterogeneous catalytic system such as transition metal nickel/copper and alkali metal hydroxides/alkoxides [22,23], homogeneous ruthenium and iridium complex catalysts [20,24,25] and heterogeneous basic catalysts such as calcium hydroxyapatite and hydrotalcite have been widely reported. The hybrid and homogeneous catalysts usually exhibit high activities, but existing the corrosion or separation problems [26,27]. Heterogeneous catalysts can be conveniently separated and recycled from the reaction broth without regeneration [28]. Nevertheless, many ethanol upgrading studies have reported the negative effect of water to the catalyst and the catalytic activity [11,13,24,29]. Thus, it is essential to develop an efficient water-tolerance catalyst for the one-pot upgrading of aqueous ethanol to higher carbon alcohols through the C–C coupling process. Carbon materials are widely employed in many kinds of catalyst system as support material due to their advantages of electron-transporting, hydrophobicity and stabilizing the metal particles [30–32]. Significantly, construction of carbon encapsulated metal catalysts can potentially overcome the aggregation of metal particles [33], as well as improve the water-resistant stability of catalyst in aqueous catalytic system [31,34,35]. In our previous study, a novel non-noble dandelion-like Ni-Sn heterogeneous catalyst was constructed, which showed excellent activity in the aqueous ethanol C–C coupling process [36]. But the catalyst stability under the hydrothermal reaction environment still need to be improved. In the present study, a facile carbon encapsulated structured strategy was employed to fabricate the NiSn@C nanohybrid catalyst, which could further improve the catalyst stability in the hydrothermal ethanol coupling reaction environment. The carbon functioned as a reducing agent and to protect the Ni-Sn metal nanoparticles from dissolution/aggregation in the aqueous environment. The structure and physic-chemical properties of the NiSn@C catalyst on the performance of catalytic upgrading of aqueous ethanol to higher alcohols were investigated. The role of metal chemical states of NiSn@C for promoting the carbon-chain growth of higher alcohols and the reusability/stability of NiSn@C were also discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalysts preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalysts preparation and characterization The NiSn@C nanohybrids were fabricated by a facile sol–gel and one-step pyrolysis/carbonization strategy as shown in Fig. 1 . Chemicals of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and SnCl4·5H2O were employed as the starting materials. Citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, CA) was adopted and functioned both as the multidentate ligand to stably disperse the metal precursors and as the carbon source and reductant to promote the formation of carbon encapsulated structure [37–39]. All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., China), and directly used without further purification unless otherwise stated. The typical fabrication process of NiSn@C nanohybrid catalyst was detailed below. Certain amount of citric acid monohydrate (CA) was firstly dissolved in deionized water (15.0 g) and stirring until completely dissolved. Subsequently, chemicals of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (3.68 g) and SnCl4·5H2O (0.22 g) were added into the above solution in sequence with string. After vigorously stirring at room temperature for 2 h, the mixture was gelled gradually by evaporation at 100 °C and subsequently dried at 100 °C for 48 h in oven. After that, the fully dried solid gels were calcined/carbonized at designed temperature in N2 flow for 4 h, using a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Finally, the solid nanohybrids were obtained and referred as NiSn@C-R-T, where “R” denotes the molar ratio of metal/Citric acid (M/CA) ranged from 5/1 to 1/5, and “T” represents the carbonization temperature ranged from 300 °C to 800 °C. It’s worth noting that the atomic ratio of Ni/Sn in the fabrication of NiSn@C nanohybrid was fixed as 20/1, which showed the best catalytic activity according to our previous study [36]. And the molar ratio of metal/citric acid (M/CA, R) was calculated based on the total mole of metal Ni and Sn to citric acid. The physicochemical properties of catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms, Raman spectra and thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC)."
3,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.2 Catalytic activity measurements The aqueous C–C coupling reaction of ethanol was carried out in a 50 mL autoclave batch reactor, which is equipped with mechanical stirring and electric heater units (Fig. S1: MS-50-316L, Anhui Kemi Co., Ltd, China). The typical reaction and product analysis process were illustrated as Fig. 2 . Typically, 50 wt% aqueous ethanol (15 g ethanol/15 g deionized water) was added to the autoclave as feedstock. 0.5 g catalyst and certain amount of NaOH (typical ethanol/NaOH molar ratio of 25/1 unless otherwise stated) were also added. Prior to reaction, the reactor was sealed and leakage checked, as well as flushed with hydrogen for several times to remove the air. The reactor was heated to 250 °C for the aqueous ethanol upgrading reaction, and hold for 24 h with stirring rate of 500 rpm. After that, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. The gas by-product was collected by typical drainage method and further analyzed by GC-FID/TCD. Meanwhile, the liquid-phase product was centrifugalized and naturally separated into two phases: the upper oil phase and the bottom aqueous phase (Fig. S1), which were further analyzed by using the standard curve method with GC-FID/GCMS respectively (Fig. S2). For analysis, the catalytic activity was evaluated based on the ethanol conversion, higher alcohol yield and the products selectivity."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 3 and Table 1 shows the results of the nitrogen porosimetry tests (pore distributions, specific surface areas, pore volumes and average pore diameters) for the prepared NiSn@C catalysts. Generally, all of NiSn@C catalysts showed distinct IV-type isotherms accompanied with hysteresis loops in high P/P0 range (Fig. 3a, c), which indicates the mesoporous structure. The pore distribution (shown in Fig. 3b, d) and average pore diameter (shown in Table 1) also confirmed the mesoporous distribution. It’s worth noting that the N2 isotherms of NiSn@C catalysts prepared with high M/CA ratio (5/1 and 2/1) showed the H3-type hysteresis loops that didn’t show saturated adsorption in high P/P0 region, which can be commonly attributed to the disordered stacking pores. Accordingly, the NiSn@C catalysts prepared with high M/CA ratio (5/1 and 2/1) also exhibited wide pore distribution (Fig. 3b). As listed in Table 1, the BET surface area of NiSn@C catalyst showed distinct increase when it was prepared with low M/AC ratio. The lower M/AC ratio means more carbon in the prepared NiSn@C catalyst, which may contribute to the particle dispersity and thus lead to the high surface area. Besides, it’s also found that the BET surface area decreased from 181.9 m2/g to 106.2 m2/g as the calcination temperature increased from 300 °C to 800 °C. The high calcination temperature can promote the decomposition and carbonization of citric acid as well as the aggregation of metal particles, which resulted in the decrease of surface area. In general, the specific surface areas of catalysts usually have important influence on the exposure of active sites, so appropriate BET surface area is necessary for the high-efficient catalytic activity. The crystal structure and phase of the prepared NiSn@C catalysts were confirmed by XRD measurement and shown in Fig. 4 . Typically, the peaks at 44.3°, 51.7° and 76.1° corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of metal Ni (JCPDS No. 01-89-7128). Meanwhile, the peaks at 2θ of 28.6°, 39.3°, 42.5°, 44.8°, 71.2° and 79.5° attribute to the plane diffraction of alloy Ni3Sn (JCPDS No. 35-1362), and the diffraction peaks at 37.1°, 43.1°, 62.6° and 75.0° belong to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of NiO (JCPDS No. 03-65-2901), respectively. The formation of metal Ni phase should be ascribed to the reduction of Ni precursor by carbon reducing agent during the carburization process, whereas the NiO phase was formed from the decomposition of Ni precursor. It should be noted that the Ni2+ was difficult to be reduced to metal Ni under the situation of insufficient carbon source or low carbonization temperature, which was confirmed from the XRD patterns of NiSn@C-5/1-500 and NiSn@C-1/2-400 samples. Meanwhile, the Ni3Sn phase was formed by the alloying of metal Ni and Sn, whereas its intensity is relatively weak due to the high Ni/Sn ratio (20/1) adopted in this work. The metal Sn phase also couldn’t be identified due to its low content. The morphologies and nanostructures of prepared NiSn@C catalysts were visualized by SEM as well as HAADF-STEM. As shown in Fig. 5 , all NiSn@C catalysts were composed of nano-particles. Specifically, the NiSn@C-5/1-500 and NiSn@C-1/2-300 samples showed aggregated particles morphology (Fig. 5a, d). The former should be caused by the high M/CA ratio of 5/1 (low carbon precursor content), which leads to the aggregation of metal particles during carbonization treatment process (Fig. 5a). Whereas the latter can be ascribed to the incomplete carbonization at low carbonization temperature (300 °C) (Fig. 5d). Notably, NiSn@C samples with M/CA ratio less than 1/2 and carbonization temperature over 500 °C exhibited uniform spheres morphology without particle aggregation (Fig. 5b, c, e and f), which could promote the exposure of active sites and mass transportation. Especially, the average particle size of NiSn@C-1/2-500 and NiSn@C-1/2-600 samples were about 27 nm and 32 nm, respectively. The detailed TEM analysis of NiSn@C samples were shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6a, the NiSn@C-5/1-500 catalyst showed obvious aggregation of NiO metal particles, which is consist with the XRD and SEM results. With the M/CA ratio decreased to 1/5, the well dispersed metal particles and thick carbon layer can be clearly observed (Fig. 6b), which should be caused by the superfluous carbon precursor. Meanwhile, the incomplete carbonization at low carbonization temperature of 300 °C (Fig. 6c, NiSn@C-1/2-300 sample) and obvious particle aggregation at high carbonization temperature of 800 °C (Fig. 6d, NiSn@C-1/2-800 sample) were also confirmed. For the NiSn@C-1/2-600 sample, a well-dispersed nanostructure can be clearly observed. The lattice fringes with width of 0.203 nm (Fig. 6f) were observed and can be related to the (111) plane diffraction of the metal Ni species, which is consistent with the prior XRD analysis. Furthermore, the HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping results (Fig. 6g-j) demonstrated that Ni and Sn elements were homogeneously distributed in the spherical particles, which indicates that the Sn species are highly dispersed. The elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 6k) and ICP results showed the Ni/Sn atomic ratio about 20.9 and 21.9 respectively, which is quite close to our design value (Ni/Sn = 20). XPS analysis was further carried out to investigate the elemental valence states of NiSn@C samples prepared at different carbonization temperature (Fig. 7 ). As shown in Fig. 7a, for the full survey scan XPS spectra of the NiSn@C-1/2-T samples, the C 1s, Sn 3d, O 1s, and Ni 2p peaks appeared at binding energy about 284, 490, 532, and 860 eV, respectively. The CC bond binding energy was calibrated to 284.8 eV. The peaks at 286.1 eV and 288.5 eV were related to the CO and CO bonds, and those bonds were also corresponded to the peaks at 532.7 eV and 531.8 eV in O 1s spectra. The CO bond peak became weaken with increasing carbonization temperature (Fig. 7b, c), which implied the decomposition of citric acid precursor. Meanwhile, the peak of metallic oxide bond (529.8 eV) also became weaken with increasing carbonization temperature, which indicated that the metallic oxide species was reduced to the metallic state. This result was further verified according to the high-resolution Ni 2p and Sn 3d profiles. As shown in Fig. 7d, the peaks of Ni 2p3/2 bond can be deconvoluted into three main peaks, indicating that there were three states for Ni on the catalyst surface. The binding energy of 852.8 eV, 853.8 eV and 855.7 eV are attributed to Ni0 (metallic Ni), NiO (metallic oxide) and other Ni2+ compounds (NiCO3 or Ni(OH)2), respectively [40]. Analogously, the peak of Sn 3d5/2 bond at binding energy of 485.5 eV and 486.5 eV are assigned to Sn0 (metallic Sn) and SnO/SnO2 (metallic oxide), respectively (Fig. 7e). The Sn2+ and Sn4+ is difficult to distinguish due to their negligible difference of binding energy [41]. The metal chemical state composition was estimated by means of deconvolution according to the corresponding Ni 2p3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 peaks, and the results were summarized in Table 2 . Obviously, the Ni and Sn mainly exist as high valence or oxidation states at carbonization temperature of 300 °C, which is in agreement with the prior XRD results. Moreover, it’s noteworthy that the high carbonization temperature clearly promoted the formation of metallic state Ni and Sn. For example, the proportion of metallic state Ni0 increased from 0.29 to 0.61 as the carbonization temperature raised from 500 °C to 800 °C, and the Sn0 also has a similar trend. The metallic states usually play crucial roles in the H-transfer de-/hydrogenation catalytic process [42], which in turn affect the catalytic activity of aqueous ethanol C–C coupling over NiSn@C catalyst. The TG-DTG/DSC thermal analysis was performed in order to understand the thermal degradation of the typical NiSn@C catalyst. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the weight of NiSn@C-1/2-400 sample first decreased slightly as the temperature increased, which should be caused by the water desorption from the sample. Then, a weight increase was identified from 200 °C to 400 °C. Combining the exothermal profile revealed according to the DSC result, this weight increase should be attributed to the oxidation of metal Ni/Sn. Besides, about 13% weight losses located from 340 °C to 450 °C was observed, which should be assigned to the burning of organic precursors and carbon species (exothermic combustion reaction), respectively [43]. Overall, total weight loss about 15.5% of the NiSn@C-1/2-400 catalyst was identified, which suggested that the mass fraction of carbon species in this sample was about 15.5%. With regards to the NiSn@C-1/2-600 and NiSn@C-1/2-800 catalysts, the distinct weight increase caused by oxidation and weight loss due to carbon burning were also observed (Fig. 8b-c). Accordingly, total weight loss of 6.7% and 2.5% on the NiSn@C-1/2-600 and NiSn@C-1/2-800 catalysts can be identified, and implying that the carbon species on these two catalysts are 6.7% and 2.5%, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was further adopted to characterize the structure of carbon species in NiSn@C catalysts. In general, the Raman characteristic peaks appear near 1580 cm−1 (G-band peak) and 1350 cm−1 (D-band peak) [44]. The D-band peak is usually believed to be formed by defects and disordered vibration in the carbon lattice, while G-band peak is related to the in-plane vibration of the sp2 hybrid carbon atoms. The ID/IG ratio (Raman intensities of the D-band peak and G-band peak) is generally adopted to identify the structure of carbon species [45]. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the NiSn@C-3/1-500 and NiSn@C-5/1-500 samples showed ambiguous D-/G-band peaks, which should be ascribed to the low carbon content in the case of M/CA ratio of 3/1 and 5/1. While other samples prepared with different M/CA ratio (2/1, 1/2 and 1/5) show the similar ID/IG ratio (∼1/1.1), which indicates their comparable graphitization degree. As for the NiSn@C-1/2-T catalysts prepared with different carbonization temperature (Fig. 9b), the ID/IG ratio obviously increased with the increase of carbonization temperature, which means the decrease of the graphitization degree. The decreased graphitization degree might be beneficial for the metal dispersion and enhancement of the catalytic activity [46]."
6,Aqueous ethanol upgrading to higher carbon bio-alcohols,"3.2 Aqueous ethanol upgrading to higher carbon bio-alcohols 3.2.1 Catalytic activity of NiSn@C-R-T catalyst Herein, the effect of M/CA ratio (R) on the catalytic activity of NiSn@C catalyst was firstly investigated. The catalytic performance of aqueous ethanol upgrading over NiSn@C-R-500 catalysts were shown in Table 3 and Fig. 10 . The NiSn@C-1/2-500 catalyst exhibited the highest ethanol conversion of 48.1% and C4 + heavy alcohol yield of 34.3%. In addition, the selectivity of alcohols in liquid products was about 90%, with trace unsaturated aldehydes. The main species of alcohol products are C4-12 saturated higher alcohols including n-OH (liner alcohol) and iso-OH (branched alcohol, Fig. S2). Besides, the obtained iso-OH species are the α-alkyl branching alcohols with CN (carbon number) ≥ 6 (e.g. 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-ethyl-1-octanol), which belong to the typical Guerbet alcohols [47]. These excellent activities could be attributed to the high surface area (123.8 m2/g), uniformly dispersed particles (27 nm) and structure of NiSn@C-1/2-500. Meanwhile, the NiSn@C-5/1-500 and NiSn@C-1/5-500 only exhibited limited heavy alcohol yield of 23.1% and 17.2%. The NiSn@C-5/1-500 catalyst prepared with M/CA ratio of 5/1 led to the aggregation of metal oxide particles during the carbonization process (see XRD and SEM/TEM analysis). On the contrary, the NiSn@C-1/5-500 catalyst prepared with M/CA ratio of 1/5 formed superfluous carbon coating (see TEM analysis) and probably hindered the molecular transportation to contact with the inside NiSn active site. As the distribution of liquid product shown in Fig. 10, the main species of alcohol products belong to ones with CN (carbon number) even ranged from 4 to 12. The carbon distribution of higher alcohols showed gradually decreasing trend with CN increased. With the M/CA ratio of 1/2, the effect of carbonization temperature (T) on the catalytic activity of NiSn@C was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 11 a, the ethanol conversion and C4+ alcohol yield increased with the carbonization temperature elevated from 300 °C to 600 °C, then slightly decreased as the carbonization temperature further raised to 800 °C. For the NiSn@C-1/2-600 catalyst, ethanol conversion of 46.9% and C4+ alcohol yield of 36.4% were achieved, and the selectivity of C4+ alcohol in liquid products reached 88.1%. Moreover, it’s worth noting that the ratio of iso-OH/n-OH (branched alcohols/line alcohols) increased obviously from 0.22 to 0.63 with the carbonization temperature increased from 300 °C to 700 °C (Fig. 11a). As the iso-OH can only be generated when the nucleophile derived from the formed alcohols with CN ≥ 4, thus the generated iso-OH products in this work are higher alcohols with CN ≥ 6 [48]. Given this, the enhanced selectivity of iso-OH product indicated that the formation of higher alcohol species was promoted. As shown in Fig. 11b, the product distribution shifted toward the higher carbon bio-alcohols with carbonization temperature increase. This selectivity shift could be related to the enhancement of the secondary self- and cross- condensation during the aqueous ethanol coupling process [47]. 3.2.2 Recycle performance and water-tolerance stability of NiSn@C catalyst Reusability of the catalysts is an essential requirement for industrial aqueous ethanol upgrading. Herein, the spent optimal NiSn@C-1/2-600 catalyst was separated by centrifugal separation and washed with deionized water for recycle run test. As shown in Fig. 12 , the spent NiSn@C-1/2-600 exhibited excellent catalytic stability even after 4 recycle runs and 120 h life-time test. Specifically, the ethanol conversion and higher alcohol selectivity kept about 45% and above 86%, respectively. The excellent reusability of the NiSn@C catalyst suggested its good water-tolerance stability. In order to verify the water-tolerance stability of the NiSn@C-1/2-600 catalyst, the TEM, XRD patterns and XPS characterization of the spent catalyst were further undertook. From the TEM image of 4th spent catalyst shown in Fig. 13 , it’s obvious that the catalyst kept the well dispersed nanoparticle structure, which is same as the fresh catalyst. Thus, the NiSn@C showed superior water-tolerance stability in comparison with our previous reported dandelion-like NiSn catalyst (see Fig. S3). Besides, the XRD and XPS characterization of the 4th spent catalyst depicted in Fig. 14 also showed little difference with that of the fresh catalyst. These results strongly demonstrated the high water-tolerance stability of the NiSn@C-1/2-600 catalyst in the aqueous ethanol upgrading process, and that could be attributed to the protective effect by the carbon layer of the NiSn@C catalyst. 3.2.3 Mechanism and discussion Considering the specific α-alkyl branching of main alcohols product, it’s reasonably concluded that the reaction network of aqueous ethanol upgrading meet with the aldol-type step-growth ethanol upgrading mechanism [47,48]. The upgrading of ethanol mainly involves three reactions: the dehydrogenation of initial alcohol to aldehyde, the NaOH base catalyzed aldol condensation of aldehyde intermediates based on nucleophilic attack mechanism and the final surface-mediated hydrogenation of the formed unsaturated alcohols to form the final higher carbon alcohol species. To further shed light on the shift of product distribution, the correlation between catalyst chemical states and the product distribution was studied. As shown in Fig. 15 a, the Ni0 and Sn0 content (metallic state Ni0 or Sn0 content in total Ni or Sn according to XPS analysis) gradually increased with the carbonization temperature increasing, and the Sn0/Ni0 ratio also increased from 0 to 1.1 with the carbonization temperature increased from 300 °C to 800 °C (Fig. 15c). Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that the selectivity of C4 alcohol (i.e. butanol) showed declining trend from 65.7% to 32.1%, while the selectivity of C8+ alcohols exhibited growth trend. The main ethanol coupling reaction should involve the below category: (1) the initial condensation between acetaldehyde (C2 coupling), (2) the condensation between acetaldehyde and generated heavy aldehyde (C2 and C4+ coupling) and (3) the condensation between generated heavy aldehydes (C4+ coupling) [9]. As previous research reported, these three main reaction networks likely have the equal average apparent rate constant, which means that the condensation process matches the step-growth polymerization mechanism [8,47]. Herein, the step-growth probability α was also adopted to further analysis the carbon distribution shift of the products. The α was determined based on the reported step-growth polymerization model: ln(Wi/i) = ilnα + ln(1-α)2/α), where i is the number of monomers in the product chain, and Wi is the mass fraction of specific product that has i number of monomers in the molecular carbon chain (the monomers should be C2 specie in this work). Accordingly, the step-growth probability α can be calculated based on the linear relation between ln(Wi/i) and i as shown in Fig. 15b [49]. The results showed an increased α value from 0.1802 to 0.4256 with the carbonization temperature increased from 300 °C to 800 °C (Fig. 15b), which indicated that the high carbonization temperature of NiSn@C catalyst enhanced the carbon chain step-growth ability during the aqueous ethanol coupling process. The correlation relation among Sn0/Ni0 ratio, iso/line alcohol ratio and chain-growth α probability were shown in Fig. 15c, and the results demonstrated the positive correlation between the Sn0/Ni0 ratio and carbon chain growth. Overall, the formation of metallic state Sn0 and Ni0 of NiSn@C catalyst promoted the generation of higher carbon bio-alcohols in the aqueous ethanol coupling process. In the previous research, the metal Ni is the main active site for ethanol coupling and the poor dehydrogenation/hydrogenation activity of Sn has been confirmed [36]. Nevertheless, the enhanced electron density of Ni atoms by the doping of Sn may play the important roles for the suppression of C-O bonds cleavage and beneficial for the formation of higher carbon bio-alcohols [50,51]."
7,Conclusion,"Herein, we have developed a strategy for the one-pot synthesis of phase-separable higher carbon bio-alcohols from aqueous ethanol (water content of 50 wt%) with 47% ethanol conversion and 36% C4+ bio-alcohols yield. The non-precious NiSn@C heterogeneous catalyst with excellent water-tolerance ability and efficient activity was fabricated. Additionally, the chemical states of Ni and Sn species in catalyst was found to be closely related to the carbon distribution shift of higher alcohol product, and the positive correlation between the Sn0/Ni0 ratio and carbon chain growth was revealed. Altogether, this process can potentially improve the economic feasibility by reducing energy-intensive purifications and distillations, also opens new possibilities for aqueous bio-ethanol conversion to candidate biofuel components and value-added chemicals."
