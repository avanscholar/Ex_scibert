0,Introduction,"Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has attracted more and more attention due to its low cost and excellent comprehensive performance, including good barrier property [1,2], good mechanical strength [3,4] and favorable biocompatibility [5,6] and biodegradability [7,8], more importantly, it can be produced via the non-petroleum routes in industrial scale [9–11]. PVA foams have great potential in tissue scaffold [12,13], wound coating [14,15] and especially in packaging materials [16,17] instead of the undegradable plastics. However, PVA foams are easily ignited due to the porous structure with large surface area, thin cell wall and high gas content, which made it harder to be flame retarded than their solid analogs [18,19]. The flammability of polymer foams might cause the serious threat to the human and environment, and severely limit their wider application in household, automobile, and aerospace fields. PVA, as a typical polyhydroxy polymer, possesses the good carbon-forming capacity in the flame-retardant system [20]. However, the release of a great amount of combustible substance and degradation products will easily deteriorate the fragile char layer during the further combustion process, which results in the flammability of PVA matrix. Generally, the strategies to enhance the flame retardancy of polymer foams mainly include three aspects. The first is to introduce the flame retardant into the reaction mixture during the polymerization or foaming process, only suitable for the foam products which were related to polymerization or reaction foaming process, such as polystyrene (PS) or polyurethane (PU) [21,22]. The second is to add the flame retardant into the polymer matrix via melt blending, followed by the expansion process to achieve the flame-retardant foams. However, the nonuniform dispersion and aggregation of flame retardant may influence the flame retardant and mechanical performance of the final foam products. Furthermore, the excessive introduction of flame retardant seriously deteriorated the foaming behaviors of the matrix [23,24]. The third approach is coating the flame retardant on the surfaces of polymer beads, which is further molded with the flame retardant enriched at the bead interface, to achieve high flame-resistance polymer foams [25,26]. In this way, the flame retardant was efficiently utilized to form the steady char layer at the polymer interfaces, which protected the inner matrix from combustible substance during the combustion process. Wang [27] et.al adopted a polycondensed macromolecular nitrogen–phosphorus (MNP) intumescent flame retardant to coat the expandable PS beads and achieved the composite foams with perfect flame retardant and acceptable physical properties through compression molding. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) and the smoking density of the flame-retardant foam reached 28.8 and 23.6, respectively, with 30% MNP loadings. Besides, Cao [28] et al introduced the 14.3% expandable graphite and 4.1% modified multi-wall carbon nanotubes into the expandable polystyrene (EPS) foams, endowing the foam part with UL94 V-0 rating, 30.3% LOI value and sharply smoke suppression. However, it should be noted that only few beads or foamed beads could be molded or interfacial sintered for the limitation of conventional sintering approaches, which significantly limited the application of interfacial flame retardant. Microwave, as one of the electromagnetic waves, has been applied in the material science and industrial production for over 50 years. Nowadays, microwave heating technology attracts increasing attention due to its ultrafast and unique heating modes with high energy efficiency [29,30]. The dipoles in the materials were rotated upon subjected to the electric field component of the microwave, leading to the inner molecular friction and further increase temperature of these materials [31]. Thus, materials with different characteristic responded distinguishingly to the microwave irradiation. Generally, the objects with high dielectric loss absorb microwave energy, and those with low dielectric loss are transparent to microwave irradiation [32]. This unique selective heating mechanism of microwave provides more possibilities for structural design and processing control of composite materials. For example, conductive fillers, which responded intensively to microwave irradiation, were coated around the polymer surface via external mechanical mixing, and then the perfect segregated conductive network could be successfully formed and stabilized by selective microwave irradiation, thus finally achieving the composites with excellent electromagnetic interference shielding and mechanical properties [33]. In this paper, we proposed a novel and efficient method to fabricate the flame-retardant PVA bead foam parts by combining the surface plasticizing and microwave selective sintering. The expanded PVA beads were prepared through supercritical carbon dioxide extrusion foaming and pelletizing. Potassium silicate (KSi) aqueous solution, which possessed good compatibility with PVA matrix, was coated on the surfaces of expanded PVA beads. In this way, the coated solution plasticized the bead surface and endowed the neighboring beads with the capacity to be sintered together. Besides, this coating responded more intensively to the microwave irradiation than pure water, which rapidly improved the temperature at the bead interface and sintered the adjacent beads into an integrated foam part within a shorter time. The tunable temperature at the interface had no negative effect on the original inner cell structure, moreover, KSi acted with PVA molecules and remained or partial embedded at the interfacial region, which significantly improved the flame retardant and mechanical properties of the PVA bead foam parts. This surface plasticizing and microwave sintering technology shows great potential in manufacturing the bead foam parts with unique three-dimensional structure."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA particles (degree of polymerization is 1700 and hydrolysis degree is 99) were obtained from Sichuan Vinylon Works, China. KSi aqueous solution was purchased from Shandong Usolf Chemical Technology Co., Ltd, China. Deionized water was prepared in our laboratory, which was used throughout the experiment. Carbon dioxide (99.5% purity) was provided by Chengdu Xuyuan Gas Co., Ltd, China."
3,Preparation of flame retardant PVA bead foams,"2.2 Preparation of flame retardant PVA bead foams First, PVA particles were placed in the oven to remove the moisture at 80 ℃. Then, the appropriate water was added to plasticize the PVA particles. The expanded PVA beads were prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) extrusion via a tandem foam system with two single screw extruders. CO2 was continuously injected into the melt with a gas flow of 2 ml/min through an ISCO Syringe high-pressure pump. The proper temperature, pressure and screw speed were adopted. The KSi aqueous solution was coated on the bead surface and then the coated PVA beads were filled in the Teflon mold and further molded in the microwave oven (MKX-J1-7, Qing Dao Microwave Creative Technology Co., Ltd, China). To investigate the influence of KSi content on the flame retardant and mechanical properties of the molded foams, various KSi loadings (0%, 9.1 wt%, 16.7 wt%, 23.1 wt% and 28.6 wt%) were added (expressed by the final actual mass fraction of KSi solute) with the same water content. To achieve the best sintering effects, the optimum microwave irradiation power and time was performed. Finally, the sintered PVA bead foams were placed into an oven to remove the moisture at 60 ℃ until achieving a constant weight. The detailed preparation process of PVA/KSi flame retardant foams was depicted in Fig. 1 ."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization EDS mapping was performed to characterize the element distribution in both surface and interior of the sintered bead foams. The sintered behaviors and cell structure of PVA beads with various KSi loadings were obtained from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) instrument (Inspect F, FEI Company, USA) with the accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Besides, the surface of PVA bead, coated PVA bead and coated PVA bead after ignition were also collected. All the samples were sputtered with the conductive gold coating. Thermal analysis of PVA beads with various KSi content was recorded on a TA-Q20 differential scanning calorimeter (TA Instrument, USA) under a nitrogen atmosphere flow of 50 ml/min. In DSC tests, the samples were heated from 40 ℃ to 250 ℃, and then cooled to 40 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min. And the heating spectra were recorded with a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in the second cycle. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were carried out on a Nicolet 6700 IR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet Ltd, Vemon Hills, IL, USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples with various KSi content were collected on a DX-1000 diffractometer (DanDong FangYuan instrument Co., Ltd. China), and the scanning 2θ ranged from 10° to 50° with the scanning speed of 10°/min. The heating behaviors of water and KSi under microwave irradiation were recorded by the thermocouple of the microwave oven. The vertical burning test of the molded PVA foam was performed on an HK-HVRA instrument (Zhuhai Huake Testing Equipment Co. Ltd, China), according to UL 94 vertical burning test. The LOI of the foam part was measured by an HC-2 oxygen index meter (LOI Analysis Instrument Company, Jiangning, China). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test was performed on an XSAM800 machine (Kratos Company, UK) with Al Kα radiation to determine the elements in the char of foams after ignition. The thermal stability of the molded foam was investigated by TGA Q-50 instrument (TA Instruments Co., Ltd, New Castle, USA) with a heating rate of 10 ℃/min from 40 ℃ to 600 ℃. Both the nitrogen and air atmosphere were tested. The Raman spectra of char residue of pure and flame-retardant PVA foams were collected on a Labram HR spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). The tensile strength and elongation at break of the PVA bead foams with various KSi content were tested on an INSTRON4302 universal testing machine (Instron Corp., USA) with a speed of 10 mm/min at ambient temperature. The specimens with dimensions of 10 × 10 × 80 mm3 were tested, and five samples were tested to obtain an average value. The compression tests of the samples with 25 mm diameter and 15 mm thickness were also performed and the corresponding compression strength was calculated."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Microwave heating and sintering behaviors,"3.1 Microwave heating and sintering behaviors The microwave responsiveness of the polar solution has a significant influence on the sintering behavior of polymer beads and thus comprehensive properties of the final foam parts, since the PVA matrix responded transparent to the microwave irradiation. In this study, KSi aqueous solution was utilized to serve as microwave absorber to coat and sinter the PVA beads, and its heating behavior under various microwave irradiation power was recorded and depicted in Fig. 2 b (In order to avoid the intensive heating rates, the concentration of KSi solution was diluted into 20 wt%). And the heating behaviors of KSi aqueous solution at different concentrations were shown in Fig. S1. In comparison, the heating behavior of pure water was also measured, shown in Fig. 2a. Obviously, KSi aqueous solution possessed the higher heating rates and wider high-temperature range than pure water, for example, 20 g KSi solution was rapidly heated with a heating rate of 4.03 ℃/s, 52% higher than that of the pure water (2.66 ℃/s) with the same weight under 900 W microwave irradiation, as shown in Fig. 2c. Generally, the electric field component of microwave induced the ultrafast and reciprocating rotation of the polar molecular dipoles, and this ‘inner friction’ caused by molecular movement contributed to the temperature increase of the system under microwave irradiation. Consequently, water and other polar solvent were rapidly and uniformly heated. In this study, as the water-soluble compound, the incorporation of KSi increased the conductivity of water and itself could also respond rapidly to the electric field of microwave, thus resulting in the more heat generation and further higher temperature increase of the whole solution [34,35]. It should be noted that the higher heating rate means less time, energy consumption and better sintering effect. Fig. 2d-f showed the sintering behaviors of coated PVA bead foams with various KSi loadings. All the samples exhibited the good sintering interface due to the rapid and local heating at the bead interface, which induced the softening, melting and cohesion of the adjacent bead surface. However, when pure water was applied as microwave absorber (prepared under 1200 W microwave irradiation in 30 s), a few small holes were located at the interface of the neighboring PVA beads, suggesting the inadequate melting of bead surface under low heating rates. In the case of the incorporation of 16.7 wt% KSi, the sintering effect was significantly improved that all the beads were closely sintered without any holes locating at the interfacial region. When KSi loadings reached 28.6 wt% (prepared under 900 W microwave irradiation in 15 s), the bead surfaces were totally melted and no obvious boundary existed at the interfacial region, demonstrating all the beads were connected into a sturdy entirety. Besides, most of the KSi particles were embedded in the PVA matrix at the interfacial region, which indicated that KSi acted and intertwined with PVA molecules during the molecular diffusion, entanglement and fusion on the bead surface. The detailed interaction between PVA and KSi will be discussed later."
7,Interaction,"3.2 Interaction Fig. 3 a depicts the surface morphology and element distribution of coated PVA/KSi foam. According to the SEM image, the surfaces of adjacent beads were connected together and appeared smooth, implying the good compatibility between KSi and PVA to ensure the compact coating of KSi on the PVA surface. Besides, all the elements (C: 38.32, O: 40.25, Si: 10.83 and K: 10.62) of PVA and KSi were clearly observed on the EDS mapping images, showing the uniform and complete coating of KSi on the PVA surface. While in the interior of the sintered foam, Si (marked by pink) and K (marked by yellow), as the characteristic element of KSi, were only detected at the junction of the neighboring beads in Fig. 3b. It showed that the flame-retardant layer selectively located at the interfacial region and completely surrounded the inner beads (marked by red), which formed a continuous network connecting the beads together and protecting the foam from burning. To deeply investigate the interaction between KSi and PVA, the FTIR, XRD and DSC measurements were performed and the corresponding results were exhibited in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a revealed the FTIR spectra of KSi, PVA foam and PVA/KSi foam. In the pure PVA spectrum, the strong and wide vibration peak at around 3369 cm−1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl group. While in the case of PVA/KSi composite foam, the characteristic absorption peaks of PVA, i.e. 2928 cm−1 of methylene group, 1330 cm−1 of C-H group and 1094 cm−1 of C-O group (superposition peak) were observed [36]. And the board peak at 1003 cm−1 was attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of Si-O of KSi, which showed the good compounding of KSi and PVA. Furthermore, the O-H stretching peak of PVA/KSi composite foam shifted from 3369 cm−1 to 3325 cm−1, indicating that the origin hydrogen bond of PVA was destroyed and the new one was formed between hydroxyl of PVA and oxygen-containing group of KSi [37,38]. Fig. 4b displayed the XRD patterns of sintered PVA foams with various KSi loadings, which revealed the influence of KSi on the crystallinity of the PVA foams. Generally, the inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of PVA contributed to its high crystallinity. The characteristic peak at 2θ = 19.5° observed in the pattern of pure PVA foam, was ascribed to the (101) plane of PVA [39]. This diffraction peak was obviously decreased with the incorporation of KSi, which indicated that KSi acted with the hydroxyl group, destroyed the hydrogen bonding and further decreased the crystallinity of PVA. It demonstrated the good compatibility between KSi and PVA and perfect plasticization effect of KSi on PVA. DSC tests were utilized to study the melting behaviors of PVA and PVA/KSi composite foams. As shown in Fig. 4c, pure PVA exhibited the melting temperature of 236.5 ℃. With the incorporation of KSi, the melting temperature gradually decreased and finally reached 232.1 ℃ in the 28.6%KSi/PVA foam. Besides, the melting enthalpy of the foam also decreased, both the results confirmed the efficient plasticization effect of KSi on PVA matrix."
8,Combustion properties,"3.3 Combustion properties To intuitively evaluate the flame-retardant effect of KSi on the PVA foams, the foamed pure PVA and PVA/KSi bead was burned under the alcohol lamp, and the detailed combusting process was shown in Fig. 5 . Obviously, pure PVA was ignited and continuously burned even away from the fire, without anything remained eventually. In contrast, the KSi-coated PVA bead rapidly extinguished after the ignition and formed the dense char layer, which exhibited the good char-formation and flame-retardant effect of KSi for PVA foams. The surface morphologies of flame-retardant PVA foam before and after burning were shown in Figs. 6b1-2 and c1-4, respectively. Obviously, the flame-retardant PVA foam exhibited the smooth and flat surface, different from the bumpy appearance of PVA without KSi coating in Fig. 6a1-2 caused by the shrinking after foaming, which further confirmed the good binding and compatibility between KSi and PVA. The dense and compact residual surface after burning was obtained in Fig. 6 c2, and at higher magnification, numerous small particles were covered on the surface. Moreover, as shown in the EDS results (Fig. 6d-e), Si element was enriched from original 10.83% to 18.56% in the char layer after burning. These results suggested that silicon-containing compounds generated and covered on the surface of the polymer matrix, which contributed to the formation of stable char layer and enhanced the resistance towards combustion in the condensed phase. Fig. 7 exhibited the combusting process of sintered PVA bead foams with various KSi loadings of vertical burning tests, and the detailed data of vertical burning and LOI tests were recorded in Table 1 . The pure PVA foam possessed the low LOI value of 20.4% and achieved no rating in the vertical burning test. It burned intensively once ignited and continuously burned out with no extinction. Furthermore, the serious melt dripping was generated during the combustion process, which could aggravate the fire damage. With the incorporation of KSi, the flame-retardant property of the composite foam was gradually improved, i.e. the ignited foam could be self-extinguished and no obvious melting dripping was observed with the increase of LOI value. However, when the KSi loading was low (9.1 wt%), the foam was not extinguished until 32 s after the first ignition, while it continuously burned for 32 s after the second ignition and extinguished at 45 s. The total burning time was more than 1 min after two ignitions, and the residual foam after burning was light and fragile as shown in the inserted photo in Fig. 7. For 28.6 wt%KSi/PVA foam, it immediately extinguished after the two ignitions, reaching a V-0 level. Besides, its LOI value was as high as 33.7%, exhibiting the perfect flame-retardant effect of KSi on PVA matrix. Adequate flame-retardant coating closely surrounded the inner expanded beads, which located at the surficial or interfacial region of the beads, effectively stabilizing the char layer of PVA and preventing the fire from continuously expansion regardless of outside or inside the bead foam parts. It could be observed that fire expanded slowly and extinguished quickly with the little change of the original sample in the photo of Fig. 7."
9,Flame retardant mechanism,"3.4 Flame retardant mechanism To clearly investigate the flame-retardant mechanism of PVA/KSi composite foam, thermogravimetric measurements of the foams under both nitrogen and air atmosphere were performed and recorded in Fig. 8 . Besides, the detailed data of the initial decomposition temperature (Ti), the temperature at maximum decomposition rate (Tmax) and the char yield of pure and flame-retardant PVA foams under nitrogen and air atmosphere were measured and recorded in Table S1 and Table S2, respectively. It could be observed that pure PVA possessed three pyrolysis stages. Initially, the elimination of side groups from the PVA molecular chains occurred between 200 ℃ and 300 ℃ and following the majority of the weight loss happened due to the chain scission and cyclization reactions [40,41]. While in the curve of PVA/KSi composite, a small peak appeared at around 150 ℃ attributed to the decomposition of the silicic acid group of KSi, which was clearly observed in the inserted pure KSi curves in Fig. 8a. It could protonate the hydroxyl and other groups on PVA chains and accelerate the elimination process, inducing the shift of the Ti of PVA to lower temperature. Besides, the generated silicone-containing compounds localized at the condensed phase to densify and stabilized the char layer caused by the cross-linking and cyclization effects of PVA. In this way, the weight loss of the second decomposition stage was significantly decreased and the residual char was increased correspondingly. Obviously, the more KSi was incorporated, the less weight loss and higher residual char was achieved. While in the TG curves of air atmosphere, both the Ti and Tmax decreased for that the degradation reaction was accelerated by the oxygen in the air. Besides, one more decomposition stage appeared from 450 to 550 ℃ in TG curves due to the further oxidation and decomposition under air atmosphere. Therefore, the less char residue was obtained in the sample treated under air atmosphere, for instance, the char yield of 16.7 wt%KSi/PVA foam decreased from 19.61% (nitrogen atmosphere) to 14.62% (air atmosphere). The cone calorimeter was carried out to evaluate the heat release behaviors of PVA foams under the real fire situation, including heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR) and total smoke production rate (TSR). Fig. 9 a showed that the pure PVA foam burned easily and continuously released the much heat during the whole combustion process. While in the flame-retardant sample (28.6 wt%KSi/PVA), the formation of char layer could protect the inner matrix from burning and reduce the heat release initially, and HRR increased with the further ignition. The THR of flame-retardant foam was 35.3 kJ/m2, about 11.8% lower than that of pure PVA foam (40.0 kJ/m2). Besides, compared with pure foam, the flame-retardant sample reduced the TSR from 801.2 m2/m2 to 469.6 m2/m2, indicating that the formation of good silicone-containing char layer isolated the combustibles and suppressed the smoke release. The residual chars of foams were depicted in Fig. 9d, obviously, the char of pure PVA foam was broken with few remnants after combustion, suggesting the flammability of pure PVA foam. On the other hand, the flame-retardant foam showed the continuous and compact char residue with no obvious cracks, which could effectively isolate heat, oxygen and smoke. These results above confirmed the good flame-retardant effects of KSi on PVA foam. Fig. 10 showed the XPS spectra of element composition and content from the residual char for the flame-retardant PVA foam after burning, which could reveal the chemical structure in the condensed phase. The full scanning spectra of the residual char exhibited all the characteristic elements, i.e. C, O, Si and K, in the flame-retardant foam as shown in Fig. 10a, which was consistent with the above EDS results. The high-resolution O1s spectra contained three peaks with binding energy of 530.9, 532.1 and 533.4 eV, which was assigned to the O-C, O-Si and O = C bonds, respectively [42,43]. Besides, the XPS spectra of C1s was also detected, with three peaks appearing at C = O (287.9 eV), C-O (285.6 eV) and C-C (284.6 eV), which indicated that KSi significantly induced the formation and enhanced the stability of char layer in the condensed phase once exposure to fire [20]. Herein, the Raman and FTIR spectra of the char residue from cone calorimeter test were plotted in Fig. 11 and Fig. S2, respectively. It was clearly observed that two characteristic peaks appeared at 1355 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 in Raman spectra represented the D band and G band, respectively. The ratio of the intensities of D band and G band (ID/IG) reveals the graphitization degree, i.e. the lower ratio means the higher graphitization degree. Obviously, the ratio of flame-retardant PVA foam decreased to the 1.60, compared with the 2.12 of the pure PVA. The flame retardant PVA foam possessed denser char layer and better carbonization capacity, which resulted in the higher graphitization degree. Besides, the decrease of the intensity of CH and CH2 absorption peak and the existence of the Si-O absorption peak in the flame-retardant PVA curve confirmed the formation of stable char layer and good carbonization effect with the incorporation of KSi, compared with the pure one as shown in Fig. S2."
10,Mechanical properties,"3.5 Mechanical properties The comprehensive mechanical properties of PVA and KSi/PVA composite bead foam parts were measured and shown in Fig. 12 . Fig. 12a exhibited the tensile strength and elongation at break of the foams. Obviously, the tensile strength of PVA foams gradually increased with the incorporation of KSi. It should be noted that the expanded PVA beads were sintered together via localized microwave irradiation, therefore the sintering strength among the adjacent beads determined the final tensile strength of the foam parts. As mentioned above, KSi endowed the skin of PVA beads with higher heating rates, acted and intertwined with PVA molecules at the interfacial regions under microwave irradiation, thus significantly improving the sintering effects. When KSi loadings increased to 28.6 wt%, the tensile strength reached 1.54 MPa, 62% higher than that of the pure PVA foam (0.95 MPa). The elongation at break of the flame-retardant foam decreased a little when 9.1 wt% KSi loadings were incorporated and then increased with more KSi concentration. It should be noted that the interfacial temperature was not high enough when the KSi loading was low with the reduction of microwave irradiation power and time, therefore, partial KSi particles were not thoroughly embedded in the PVA matrix, which resulted in the slightly decrease of elongation at break. While with the increase of KSi loading, the interfacial heating was greatly improved and the molecular movement was also enhanced, KSi particles could thoroughly intertwined with PVA molecules during the molecular diffusion, thus connecting all the beads into a sturdy entirety, which increased the elongation at break of the bead foam. Besides, the compression strength of the foams was also shown in Fig. 12b. Flame-retardant layers closely coated and surrounded the inner polymer beads, which formed a continuous network localizing and embedding at the interfacial regions, thus connecting the whole foam part and enhancing the compressive resistance. Hence, the compression strength increased to 746.1 kPa in 28.6 wt%KSi/PVA composite foam in comparison with that of 466.2 kPa in pure PVA foam. In general, the comprehensive mechanical properties of the flame-retardant foam were enhanced by the incorporation of KSi."
11,Conclusion,"In this paper, we successfully developed the PVA/KSi composite bead foams with enhanced flame retardancy and mechanical property via the surface plasticizing and microwave selective sintering. Herein, KSi, serving as both surficial plasticizer and microwave absorber, significantly improved the sintering behaviors and reduced the energy consumption, compared with pure water. The KSi coating layers on the surface of foamed PVA bead were rapidly and selectively heated with nearly no deterioration on the inner cell structure, and it acted and intertwined with PVA molecules during the surficial fusion process. In this way, the coating layer was located and embedded at the interfacial region, which sintered the whole matrix firmly and formed the flame-retardant network to prevent the inner beads from burning, thus endowing the foam part with good flame retardancy and mechanical property. This unique microwave heating and bead sintering strategy might have great potential in the fabrication of functional polymer-based foams with required 3D structures."
