0,Introduction,"Metal nanoparticles have often been used as co-catalysts for semiconductor photocatalysts when the position of the conduction band bottom (CBB) is close to the reduction potential (RP) of target compounds [1–3]. The most popular co-catalyst is platinum (Pt), which has been used for hydrogen (H2) production through proton (H+) reduction (RP: 0 V vs NHE) with photogenerated electrons over titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2) with an anatase structure (CBB: ca -0.3 V vs NHE) [4–9]. Metal nanoparticles are also utilized as co-catalysts for photocatalytic conversion of organic compounds. Palladium (Pd) exhibits excellent performance as a co-catalyst for dechlorination of chlorinated compounds [10] and hydrogenation of unsaturated CC bonds [11] over a TiO2 photocatalyst. Silver (Ag) [12], copper (Cu) [13] and rhodium (Rh) [14] also show specific and selective performance for photocatalytic reductive conversion of organic compounds. These results of past studies indicate that the combination of TiO2 and metal nanoparticles widens the possibility of photocatalytic conversion. Reductive conversion over a TiO2 photocatalyst with a co-catalyst can be roughly separated into two processes [11–14]: 1) formation of active hydrogen species over the co-catalyst through the reaction of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and H+ in the liquid phase and 2) reaction of a target compound and active hydrogen species over the co-catalyst. In other words, photocatalytic reduction over TiO2 is regarded as a combination of photoinduced electron production over TiO2 and catalytic reduction (hydrogenation) over the co-catalyst. As a side reaction, H2 evolution by coupling of H+ occurs if process 2) is slow over the co-catalyst. This means that the property of the co-catalyst loaded on TiO2 controls the performance (reactivity and selectivity) of the photocatalytic reduction. There are several methods to enhance the catalytic performance of metal catalysts and the use of two metals (bimetallic system) is one of the effective methods [15–19]. A bimetallic system can be roughly classified into alloy type and core-shell type. In the former type, it is generally difficult to understand the function of each element because the mixing level greatly depends on the preparation method, and the distribution of two elements on the surface and in the bulk (depth direction) should be considered for discussion of the catalytic performance. On the other hand, due to the simpler distribution of two elements in the core-shell type, discussion of the catalytic performance of the bimetallic system would be easier than that of the alloy type. In our previous study, we achieved H2-free semihydrogenation of alkyne over a Cu-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst [13]. This photocatalyst converts alkynes to cis-alkenes selectively with complete suppression of isomerization and overhydrogenation of cis-alkenes, and the reaction rate greatly increased at a slightly elevated temperature with maintenance of a high level of cis-selectivity [20]. In photocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes, catalytic performance of Cu metal was greatly enhanced by introduction of a Pd core [21]. Inspired by the results obtained by using the Pd core-Cu shell, we were interested in another shell metal as the co-catalyst for semihydrogenation of alkynes. Silver metal exhibited negligible activity as a co-catalyst for photocatalytic alkyne hydrogenation [13]. In the field of catalytic (not photocatalytic) semihydrogenation under H2, Pd core-Ag shell nanoparticles (Pd@Ag) supported on hydroxy apatite hydrogenated alkynes to alkenes in high yields [15]. The authors of the paper reported that 1) H2 was supplied to the Ag shell from the Pd core, 2) the Ag shell worked as active sites for semihydrogenation, and 3) Ag played a role to inhibit overhydrogenation of alkenes over Pd. Since the mechanisms of catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of H2 and photocatalytic hydrogenation in the absence of H2 are different, investigation of photocatalytic hydrogenation over TiO2 having Pd@Ag (Pd@Ag/TiO2) and discussion of the functions of Pd and Ag in alkyne hydrogenation are valuable for designing photocatalysts having core-shell particles. We prepared Pd@Ag/TiO2 by a two-step photodeposition method [22,23] and used it for photocatalytic hydrogenation of alkyne in an alcohol suspension without the use of H2 gas. We report here 1) characterization of Pd@Ag/TiO2 having various Ag contents, 2) evaluation of photocatalytic alkyne hydrogenation over Pd@Ag/TiO2 and 3) discussion of the functions of Pd and Ag in the alkyne hydrogenation based on the kinetics of Pd@Ag/TiO2."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Ag/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2,"2.1 Preparation of Ag/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 Palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2) and silver(I) nitrate (AgNO3) (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) were used as received without further purification. In 10 cm3 of a 50 vol% aqueous 2-propanol solution containing PdCl2 or AgNO3 in a Pyrex test tube, TiO2 (P 25 supplied by Nippon Aerosil, Tokyo, Japan) was suspended, and the gas phase (air) of the test tube was replaced with argon (Ar). After plugging the test tube with a rubber septum, the suspension under continuous stirring was photoirradiated using a high-pressure mercury lamp (Koike Precision Instruments, Hyogo, Japan) for 2 h in a water bath kept at 293 K. The resulting powder was washed repeatedly with distilled water and dried for 2 h in vacuo."
3,Preparation of Pd@Ag/TiO2,"2.2 Preparation of Pd@Ag/TiO2 For preparation of Pd@Ag/TiO2, 0.2 mol%Pd/TiO2 (Pd(0.2)/TiO2) was used as the starting material. An Ag shell was introduced onto Pd particles with a photodeposition method that had been used as the method for preparation of Au@Cu/CeO2 [22] and Au@Pd/TiO2 [23]. The amount of Ag (X) was changed from 0 to 4.0 mol% and the samples are designated as Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 hereafter."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) were used to observe nanoparticles loaded on TiO2 over a JEM-3010 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 200 kV in the Joint Research Center (JRC) at Kindai University. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ag/TiO 2 and Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 were measured using an AXIS-NOVA ESCA (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in JRC at Kindai University."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogenation of 4-octyne at 293 K,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogenation of 4-octyne at 293 K Metal-loaded TiO2 (50 mg) was suspended in 5 cm3 of 2-propanol containing 4-octyne (ca. 60 μmol) in a test tube, which was sealed with a rubber septum and then photoirradiated under Ar at 293 K with the high-pressure mercury lamp. The amounts of 4-octyne, cis-4-octene, trans-4-octene and octane were determined with an FID-type gas chromatograph (GC-2025, Shimadzu) equipped with a DB-1 column. Toluene was used as an internal standard sample. The internal standard solution (0.1 cm3) was added to the reaction solution (3 cm3). After the mixture had been stirred for 5 min, the amounts of 4-octyne, cis-4-octene, trans-4-octene and octane were determined from the ratios of the peak areas to the peak area of toluene. The amount of H2 as the reduction product of protons (H+) and the amount of acetone as the oxidation product of 2-propanol were determined with a TCD-type gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu) equipped with an MS-5A column and an FID-type gas chromatograph (GC-2025, Shimadzu) equipped with a DB-WAX column, respectively."
6,Action spectrum,"2.5 Action spectrum A multi-wavelength irradiation monochromator (MM-3, Bunkoukeiki, Tokyo, Japan) was used to obtain apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), and light intensity was determined by using a spectroradiometer (USR-45D, Ushio, Tokyo, Japan). The amount of 4-octyne was determined in the same way as that for the photocatalytic reaction (Section 2.3). Using Eq. (1), AQE at each centered wavelength of light was calculated from the amount of cis-4-octene formed and the number of photons irradiated: (1) AQE = 2 × amount of c i s -octene f o r m e d amount of incident photons × 100"
7,Kinetics study (photocatalytic reaction at various temperatures),"2.6 Kinetics study (photocatalytic reaction at various temperatures) A reaction mixture containing 2-propanol (5 cm3), Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 (50 mg) and 4-octyne (90 μmol) in a test tube, which was set in a water bath made of glass kept at various temperatures, was photoirradiated with a UV LED (PJ-1505-2CA, CCS Inc., Kyoto)."
8,Catalytic hydrogenation of 4-octyne under H2 in the dark,2.7 Catalytic hydrogenation of 4-octyne under H2 in the dark Metal-loaded TiO2 (50 mg) was suspended in 5 cm3 of 2-propanol containing 4-octyne (ca. 60 μmol) in a test tube. The test tube was sealed with a rubber septum under H2 and the mixture was stirred in a water bath kept at 293 K in the dark. The amount of 4-octyne was determined in the same way as that for the photocatalytic reaction (Section 2.4).
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2,"3.1 Characterization of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 Fig. 1 (a) shows a TEM photograph of Pd(0.2)/TiO2, indicating that Pd nanoparticles were successfully loaded on TiO2. From the particle size distribution (Fig. S1(a)), the average diameter of the particles (D ave) was determined to be 2.5 nm. Nanoparticles were also observed in TEM photographs of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 (Fig. 1(b)–(f)) and the values of D ave were larger than that of Pd(0.2)/TiO2 (Table 1 ), indicating that Ag was deposited on Pd nanoparticles. Table 1 also shows the thickness of the Ag shell calculated from two values of D ave of Pd(0.2)/TiO2 and Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2. The thickness of the Ag shell gradually increased with an increase in the Ag content (X). In the TEM-EDX map of Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 (Fig. S2), Ag was deposited on Pd particles and the noise levels of Ag and Pd on TiO2 were same, indicating that Ag and Pd form the core-shell structure. Fig. 2 (a) shows Ag 3d XPS spectra of Ag(0.5)/TiO2 and Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2. Peaks assignable to Ag0 were observed in the spectrum of Ag(X)/TiO2 at around 367.9 eV and 373.9 eV [24]. In the spectra of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2, peaks assignable to Ag0 and Ag+ were observed and the intensity of the peaks increased with increase in X. We noted that the peaks of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 were slightly shifted to the lower binding energy, indicating that a part of Ag in the shell of these samples was in an electron-rich state. Fig. 2(b) shows Pd 3d XPS spectra of the same samples and peaks were observed at around 335.0 eV and 340.3 eV. The shape of Pd 3d spectra of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 was similar to that of Pd 3d spectra of Pd@Cu/TiO2 [21] prepared by the same method, in which both Pd0 and Pd2+ [25] were present. Peak intensity decreased with an increase in X, which is consistent with the increase in the thickness of the Ag shell. From the results of TEM and XPS analyses, it can be concluded that the electronic state of the Ag shell is affected by the Pd core, especially in the samples having a thinner Ag shell. Since Pd-Ag/TiO2 samples were prepared by two step-photodeposition method (Pd first and then Ag) at room temperature, a high level of Pd and Ag alloying is ruled out and alloying of Pd and Ag may occur only at the interface of Pd particles and Ag deposited on Pd."
11,Effects of introduction of an Ag shell on photocatalytic hydrogenation over Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2,"3.2 Effects of introduction of an Ag shell on photocatalytic hydrogenation over Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 Table 2 shows 4-octyne conversion and product selectivity over Pd/TiO2 and Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 for 1 h. For comparison, the results for Pd-free Ag/TiO2 are also shown in Table 2. Conversion (Conv.) and selectivity (Sel.) were calculated by Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively: (2) Conv. = n 0 ( 4-Octyne ) - n ( 4-Octyne ) n 0 (4-Octyne) × 100 (3) Sel. = n ( product ) n 0 (4-Octyne) - n ( 4-Octyne ) × 100 No 4-octyne was converted over Ag/TiO2 (Entry 1), indicating Ag/TiO2 was inactive for photocatalytic hydrogenation of alkyne under this condition. On the other hand, 4-octyne was fully hydrogenated to octane when Pd/TiO2 was used (Entry 2), indicating that Pd/TiO2 has strong hydrogenation activity. When Pd/TiO2 was modified with 0.1 mol%Ag, production of octane was greatly suppressed and cis-4-octene was obtained with a high selectivity (94 %) together with a small amount of trans-4-octene (Entry 3). Results of Entries 2 and 3 show that Pd metals are not the active sites for semihydrogenation. The selectivity of cis-4-octene further increased to 99 % when 0.5 mol%Ag was introduced to Pd/TiO2 (Entry 4). Almost stoichiometric conversion of 4-octyne to cis-4-octene (99 %), i.e., 99 % selectivity at >99 % conversion, was contrast with general results (a high alkene selectivity at a low alkyne conversion). More introduction of Ag resulted in a decrease in the conversion of 4-octyne with maintenance of high selectivity to cis-4-octene (Entries 5-8). These results indicate that excessive activity of Pd nanoparticles is suppressed and changed to mild and selective by the introduction of a thin Ag shell. Almost ideal performance was achieved when X was 0.5 and the catalytic performance gradually became closer to that of Ag/TiO2 with an increase in the thickness of the Ag shell. Changes in the catalytic performance were in an agreement with the electronic state of Ag, i.e., Ag in an electron-rich state is important as the active sites for selective hydrogenation of 4-octyne to cis-4-octene. These results show that inert Ag co-catalyst was activated by a Pd core."
12,Catalytic properties of Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 and kinetics in hydrogenation of 4-octyne,"3.3 Catalytic properties of Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 and kinetics in hydrogenation of 4-octyne Fig. 3 shows time courses of products obtained in photocatalytic reaction of 4-octyne over Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2. 4-Octyne was almost quantitatively converted to cis-4-octene after 1 h. On the other hand, trans-4-octene and octane were not produced before and after 1 h, indicating that isomerization and overhydrogenation of cis-4-octene were almost completely suppressed by the introduction of an Ag shell. To evaluate the selectivity of cis-4-octene and intermediates in the hydrogenation of 4-octyne and the stoichiometric balance between photocatalytic oxidation and reduction, two indicators, i.e., material balance (MB) and redox balance (RB), were calculated from Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively: (4) MB= n ( 4-Octyne ) +n ( c i s / t r a n s -4-Octene ) +n ( Octane ) n 0 ( 4-Octyne ) (5) RB = n ( c i s / t r a n s -4-Octene ) +2n ( Octane ) +n ( H 2 ) n ( Acetone ) where n(4-Octyne), n(cis/trans-4-Octene), n(Octane), n(H2) and n(Acetone) are the amounts of 4-octyne, cis/trans-4-octene, octane, H2 and acetone during the photocatalytic reaction, respectively, and n0(4-Octyne) is the amount of 4-octyne before the photocatalytic reaction. The values of MB and RB were close to 1.0, indicating that formation of stable intermediates was negligible and acetone was the sole product of oxidation. The excellence of the Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 photocatalyst is that H2 evolution barely occurs during hydrogenation of 4-octyne. Based on the results of hydrogenation over co-catalyst-loaded TiO2, this reaction is described as follows: 1) positive holes and electrons are formed under UV light irradiation, 2) 2-propanol is oxidized by positive holes, resulting in the formation of protons and acetone, 3) the protons are reduced by electrons over the Pd@Ag co-catalyst, resulting in the formation of active hydrogen species (AHS), 4) 4-octyne reacts with AHS, producing cis-4-octene, and 4’) as a side reaction, H2 is evolved by self-coupling of AHS. Fig. 4 shows photoabsorption spectra of bare TiO2 and Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2. The action spectrum of hydrogenation of 4-octyne to cis-4-octene over Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 is also shown in Fig. 4, indicating that AQE showed a tendency similar to the absorption spectrum of bare TiO2. This result means that this reaction was induced by photoabsorption of TiO2. The value of AQE calculated from Eq. (6) was 29.4 % at 331 nm. In the range of ca. 400–450 nm, Ag nanoparticles often show surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) and may induce photocatalytic reaction. However, the action spectrum means that SPR of Ag nanoparticles in Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 does not contribute to the hydrogenation under the present condition. To understand the high selectivity of hydrogenation over Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2, reactions were carried out at various temperatures under irradiation of light from a UV-LED. The kinetics was evaluated from the apparent activation energy (E a) on hydrogenation of 4-octyne and H2 evolution in a 2-propanol suspension of Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2. Fig. 5 (a) and (b) show time courses of the amounts of 4-octyne and cis-4-octene at various reaction temperatures, respectively. The rates of 4-octyne consumption and cis-4-octene production increased with increase in the reaction temperature, and the rate constants were determined on the basis of zero-order kinetics. From the slope of an Arrhenius plot shown in Fig. 5(c), the value of E a was determined to be 12 kJ mol−1. Compared with values of E a of the hydrogenation over Cu/TiO2 (54 kJ mol−1) [20] and Pd@Cu/TiO2 (25 kJ mol−1) [21], the much smaller value of E a means that a Pd core and an Ag shell are a good combination for selective hydrogenation of 4-octyne. To obtain information about the side reaction, i.e., H2 evolution, UV irradiation to 2-propanol suspensions of Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 in the absence of 4-octyne was carried out at various temperatures, in which only H2 was produced because there was no other electron acceptor. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the results and an Arrhenius plot, respectively, and E a of H2 evolution was determined to be 17 kJ mol−1. High selectivity of Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 for 4-octyne hydrogenation is explained by the value of E a for 4-octyne hydrogenation being smaller than the value of E a for H2 evolution. Production of H2 means that AHS are not selectively used for hydrogenation. We think that efficiency of AHS utilization (EHU) is important as well as hydrogenation selectivity and will discuss EHU in the next section."
13,Effect of Ag content on catalytic properties of Pd@Ag/TiO2,"3.4 Effect of Ag content on catalytic properties of Pd@Ag/TiO2 To investigate the catalytic properties of Pd@Ag/TiO2 having various thicknesses of the Ag shell, hydrogenation of 4-octyne over Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 was carried out for 0.5 h and values of EHU on the hydrogenation were compared. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show the amounts of the reduction product (cis-4-octene and H2) and oxidation product (acetone) in 2-propanol suspensions. The amounts of cis-4-octene and acetone monotonically decreased when the thickness of the Ag shell increased. On the other hand, the amount of H2 evolved reached a maximum at X = 1.0 and then decreased with increase in X. 4-Octyne barely hydrogenated to cis-4-octene at X = 4.0, indicating that most of the AHS were used for H2 evolution. In addition, only H2 evolution occurred over Pd-free Ag(0.5)/TiO2. From these results, values of EHU for the hydrogenation were calculated and are summarized in Table 3 , indicating that the maximum value of EHU (81 %) was obtained at X = 0.5. EHU was calculated from Eq. (6): (6) EHU = n ( c i s -4-Octene ) n ( Acetone ) ×100 Values of E a for hydrogenation and H2 evolution over Pd-free Ag(0.5)/TiO2 and Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 are shown in Table 4 . The values of E a for hydrogenation gradually increased when the thickness of the Ag shell increased and drastically increased at X = 4.0. Since no hydrogenation occurred even at 328 K, E a of Pd-free Ag(0.5)/TiO2 was not determined, suggesting that the value of E a is very large. The change in E a for H2 evolution was small compared with the change in the E a for hydrogenation, and the catalytic properties of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 became close to those of Ag(0.5)/TiO2 as shown in Table 4. Interestingly, the value of E a for hydrogenation became larger than that of E a for H2 evolution at X = 4.0."
14,Effects of reaction conditions,"3.5 Effects of reaction conditions Table 5 shows the effects of photoirradiation, co-catalyst and atmosphere of gas phase on hydrogenation of 4-octyne at 293 K. Photoirradiation to 4-octyne in the presence of Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2 under Ar for 1 h produced cis-4-octene almost quantitatively (Entry 1). No hydrogenation occurred under Pd(0.2)@Ag(X)/TiO2-free and light-free conditions (Entries 2 and 3). Entries 4-6 show the results of thermal reactions at 293 K under H2 (1 atm) for 1 h. In the presence of Pd(0.2)/TiO2, 4-octyne was deeply hydrogenated to octane (Entry 4). No hydrogenation of 4-octyne occurred over Ag(0.5)/TiO2 even under H2 (Entry 5). Thermal catalysis of Pd nanoparticles was controlled by introducing an Ag shell and cis-4-octene was produced selectively (Entry 6). However, the rate of the thermal reaction was about one-fifth of that of the photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 3), suggesting that formation of AHS by photocatalytic reduction of H+ on Pd@Ag nanoparticles occurs more easily than that by dissociative adsorption of molecular H2. Effect of the light intensity on the cis-4-octene yield was examined (Fig. S3). Larger yield of cis-4-octene was obtained under more intense light; however, the yield gradually saturated just like a logarithmic curve. In other words, a modest yield can be obtained under light intensity of several mW cm−2, which is almost equal to that of solar light."
15,Reusability and applicability of Pd@Ag/TiO2,"3.6 Reusability and applicability of Pd@Ag/TiO2 Table 6 shows the results of re-use of Pd@Ag/TiO2 for hydrogenation of 4-octyne and use of Pd@Ag/TiO2 for hydrogenation of other alkynes. After the first use (Entry 1), Pd@Ag/TiO2 still showed high performance for 4-octyne hydrogenation in the second and third uses (Entries 2 and 3). cis-Selectivity was also achieved in hydrogenation of 2-hexyne (Entry 4). Pd@Ag/TiO2 also worked in hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to corresponding alkenes (Entries 5-7). We noted that Pd@Ag/TiO2 was not active for a carbon-nitrogen triple bond (CN) (Entries 6). Interestingly, a chloro group, which is typically a good leaving group, was preserved in hydrogenation of alkyne (Entries 7). Since Pd is very active for elimination of a chloro group from a hydrocarbon [10], this result indicates that the Pd core was almost completely covered with the Ag shell. These results show a wide applicability of the Pd@Ag/TiO2 photocatalyst in hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes."
16,Conclusion,"Pd@Ag/TiO2 having various Ag contents was prepared by using a two-step photodeposition method and used for photocatalytic hydrogenation of alkyne in an alcohol suspension without the use of H2 gas. Almost quantitative conversion of 4-octyne to cis-4-octene was achieved over Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2, while evolution of H2 as the by-product barely occurred during the hydrogenation, resulting in high efficiency of AHS in photocatalytic hydrogenation. Reactions at various temperatures revealed that the activation energies for the photocatalytic hydrogenation and H2 evolution over Pd(0.2)@Ag(0.5)/TiO2 were 12 kJ mol−1 and 17 kJ mol−1, respectively, which explains the high value of EHU in the hydrogenation. With increase in the Ag content, the value of E a in the hydrogenation became close to that in H2 evolution, resulting in a decrease in the value of EHU in the hydrogenation. An applicability test showed that the Pd@Ag/TiO2 photocatalyst can be used for hydrogenation of various alkynes to alkenes."
