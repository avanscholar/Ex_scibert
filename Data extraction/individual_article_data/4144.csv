0,Introduction,"Conversion of carbonyl functionality into alcohols is considered as a versatile transformation in synthetic organic chemistry [1]. To attain this transformation, several strategies have been employed which includes reduction by metal hydrides and metals, hydrogenation by catalysts and transfer hydrogenation by H-donor solvents [2]. Among these strategies, transfer hydrogenation reaction of ketones is an easy and alternative pathway to synthesize important secondary alcohols rather than gas phase hydrogenation route which yield poor results. Hydrogenation reactions of ketones are challenging and difficult due to its very harsh and tedious procedures. To overcome the challenges observed in conventional hydrogenation reactions, a feasible and convenient transfer hydrogenation route has been established. Compared to catalytic hydrogenation reactions, transfer hydrogenation reactions are environmentally amiable as there are no hazardous wastes generated after the reaction and selection of hydrogen donors control the reaction rate and selectivity of the reaction. Moreover, potentially explosive hydrogen gas in pressure equipment for reaction setup can be avoided. Among active hydrogen donors, 2-propanol, inexpensive and non-toxic solvent, is widely used as H-donor solvent due to formation of non-hazardous acetone as side product which is easily eliminated by simple distillation. In 20th century, three groups are separately carried out reduction of carbonyl groups by using 2-propanol as H-donor and Al(Oi-Pr)3 as mediator [3]. After this milestone discovery, some researchers have used transition metal complex for the same and extensively applied for hydrogen transfer reactions of imine and ketones [4]. Out of these transition metal complex, noble metals like Ir, Rh and Ru act as homogeneous catalytic system for efficient hydrogen-transfer reaction [5,6]. Ruthenium metal organocatalysis is a growing topic in coordination chemistry due to its equivalent or better activity compared with palladium metal in certain reactions. The coordination environment or supporting ligands [7] such as phosphines, carbonyl, arenes, dienes and cyclopentadienyl of Ru complexes display unexpected and diverse effects on the reaction rate and activity of the reactions. Among the ruthenium coordination compounds, ruthenium arene complexes like dimeric p-cymene complexes are widely used towards organotransformation reactions like oxidation of alcohols [8] and silanes [9], alkyne hydrosilyaltion [10], dehydration reactions [11], synthesis of enones from terminal alkynes via. 1,4 addition reaction [12] and Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene [13] etc. Thus, the utility of [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex as efficient catalyst towards the transfer hydrogenation reaction is widely appreciated. Even though [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex [14] exhibit many attractive properties like catalytic activity and selectivity, its usage in organic reactions are difficult due to its separation and poor stability under reaction conditions. To alleviate these problems, anchoring of [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex over modified supports [15] are desirable. Moreover, by heterogeneous way [16], aggregate formation of the catalyst complex and side reactions such as alkylation and dimerization can be circumvented with catalytic activity and selectivity similar to its homogeneous analogues. Since the discovery of MCM-41 [17], the utility of meso-silica materials as support have received wide attention due to its exceptional physical properties. To engineer new types of hybrid materials compared to meso-silica materials [18] (SBA-15 and MCM-41), in 1999, Terasaki [19], Stein [20] and Ozin [21] groups, independently discovered organic-inorganic hybrid material, dubbed as periodic mesoporous organosiilca (PMO) [22]. These materials having uniformly arranged organic-inorganic groups show inherent textural properties such as higher hydrophobicity and surface area which are important in avoiding unwanted side products during fine chemical syntheses [23]. To elaborate its vivid applications, grafting of Ru and Rh organometallic complexes over modified PMO materials [24] has been reported without any drop of catalytic activity from its neat complexes. The primary aim of this work is to synthesize p-cymene (Cym) based ruthenium complexes over aminofunctionalized benzene-organosilica and apply as a catalyst for the production of secondary alcohols from ketones via. transfer hydrogenation strategy by using 2-proponal as H-donor under ambient conditions. By this way, our catalyst Ru(II)Cym@PMOB was tried to overcome all alleviations from gas phase hydrogenation reactions and provides an energy feasible pathway to attain value added chemicals."
1,Experimental,"The reagents used for the preparation of benzene containing periodic mesoporous organosilica and heterogenized organometallic complex are given below: 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene (BTEB), octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C18TAB), 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), ruthenium(III)chloride hydrate (RuCl3. 3H2O), α-phellandrene and sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH) were procured from Aldrich and Merck, respectively. 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene (BTEB) and octadecyltrimethylammoniumchloride (C18-TAB) were used as reagents for the synthesis of Benzene-organosilica (PMOB). The composition of precursors for PMOB synthesis is given as: C18-TAB (47.88mmol): BTEB (49.67mmol): Water (500g): NaOH (200mmol). To a basic (NaOH) solution of C18-TAB (147.88mmol), 19.99g of BTEB (49.67mmol) added dropwise with constant stirring. The reaction mixture was treated by ultrasonication for next 20min. After ultrasonication, the solution was stirred at 30°C for 20h and kept at 95°C for 20h at static manner. The solution was filtered, washed, dried to form as-synthesized benzene-organosilica. Further, 1g of as-made PMOB was solvent extracted by continuous stirring with acidified ethanol (0.5g of 36% HCl in 100ml EtOH) to remove C18-TAB surfactant at 70 °C for 6h [25]. To improve surface properties of PMOB and to create a scavenger for [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex, aminofunctionalization of PMOB was performed (Scheme 1 -b). Before organofunctionalization, organosilica material was pretreated at 110°C for 3h. About, 1g of the PMOB was refluxed (8h) with 0.35g of 3-APTMS in 30ml of toluene under inert conditions. The residual mixture was filtered, washed and solvent extracted by dichloromethane to obtain aminofunctionalized PMOB, NH2@PMOB. The elemental analysis of this sample showed that 0.001571mol/g nitrogen atoms from aminogroups were successfully grafted on PMOB by replacing surface silanol groups. To attain fresh and active neat ruthenium dimer complex, synthesis of RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex was carried out by modifying a report procedure (Scheme 1-a) [14]. In this procedure, a mixture of hydrated ruthenium (III) trichloride (2g, 7.6mmol) and α-phellandrene (10ml) is dissolved in 100ml ethanol and refluxed for 4h. The residue was filtered, washed with ethanol and vacuum dried to get pure [RuCl2 (p-cymene)]2 complex without further purification (70% yield). The immobilization of homogeneous complex (Scheme 1-c), [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 over NH2@PMOB was carried out in the following procedure: one gram of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 complex was dissolved in 50ml dichloromethane and then refluxed with 1g of dried NH2@PMOB for 12h under inert conditions. The resulting mixture was filtered, dried under vacuum and soxhlet extraction was performed with dichloromethane to eliminate unreacted [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 complex. The percentage of C, H and N were calculated by using (Model EA 1108) Carlo Erba elemental analyzer. PXRD was done on PAN analytical X’pert Pro goniometer diffractometer. Physical properties of materials were calculated by N2 sorption analysis using Quantachrome Autosorb 1C, USA. The BET method and BJH model were used to calculate surface area and average pore diameter at P/Po=0.65–0.45 & P/Po=0.99, respectively. Bruker alpha T FTIR spectrophotometer were used to measure FTIR spectra in the region of 4000–400cm−1 at 30°C. MAS NMR spectra of 29Si and 13C were measured on BRUKER DSX300 at 7.05T. HRTEM images were performed on A JEOL JEM-3010 and Tecnai (Model F30) at 300KV. SEM images were obtained by using FEI company, Quanta 200 3D at 30kV. Thermal analysis was done using a Pyris Diamond TGA analyzer with 10 °Cmin−1 and air atmosphere. To test the efficacy of the synthesized materials, the hydrogen transfer reactions of phenyl methyl ketones has been performed by using 2-propanol as solvent as well as proton source. Catalysts such as neat [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 complex (0.005g) or Ru(II)Cym@PMOB (0.03g) was taken in a round bottom flask and degassed three times with N2. After that, a stock solution of ketone (2.5mmol in 3ml 2-propanol) was added by a syringe followed by 0.3ml KOH solution (5mg in 0.5ml 2-propanol) under inert condition. Solution was stirred at 80°C and aliquots were taken in appropriate intervals from reaction vial and after centrifugation, the supernatant solution was analyzed on a GC (HP 6890) with FID and a capillary column. Approximately 0.5 Mol% of Ru element of the applied catalyst was used in TH reactions with respect to mmol of substrate."
2,Results and discussions,
3,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Small (A) and wide (B) angle XRD pattern of (a) as-synthesized PMOB (b) extracted PMOB (c) NH2@PMOB and (d) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB are plotted in Fig. 1 . Compared to the as-synthesized PMOB [Fig. 1A(a)], extracted PMOB [Fig. 1A(b)] exhibits higher XRD reflections due to the density contrast between siloxane framework and mesopores [26]. From the comparison related to peak intensity, it is also obvious that, after amino functionalization and complexation [Fig. 1A(c, d)], the peak intensities were found to be decreasing which may be explained due to the insertion of organomoities into well ordered channels. The well-defined PXRD pattern of PMOB, indexed to (100), (110) and (200) Bragg reflections, located at 2θ=2.1, 3.7, 4.3°, is characteristic of long range hexagonal meosporosity of PMOB. A peculiar property of organosilica materials, the molecular-scale periodicity in organo-framework along the channel direction, were revealed in wide angle spectra (2θ=10°–70°) [Fig. 1B(a–d)] where reflections are observed at 12 (200), 24 (300) and 36° (400), respectively. It is obvious that the intensity of peaks is intact in all synthesized materials which manifest the structured integrity even after the multi-synthetic procedures. The particle size of PMOB was found to be ∼16nm from small angle XRD by Scherrer equation. N2 sorption analyses reveal that Ru(II)Cym@PMOB represent clean type IV uniform isotherm with a steady inflection of adsorption branch at P/P 0 =0.35 owing to the capillary condensation of N2 in the cylindrical mesopores. N2 sorption isotherms and PSD curves (inset) of (A) PMOB and (B) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB are shown in Fig. 2 and physical properties of these materials are presented in Table 1 . According to the results of Table 1, the gradual decrease in textural properties of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB from PMOB indicates the insertion of organomoities inside the mesoporous channels. To evaluate the thermal stability and amount of organic loading of organic-inorganic hybrid material, thermal analyses such as TG and DTA of (a) as-synthesized PMOB, (b) extracted PMOB, (c) NH2@PMOB and (d) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB were carried out and shown in Fig. 3 A and B. The TGA curves of as-synthesized PMOB [Fig. 3A(a)] Exhibits 3 weight loss steps; weight loss <100°C is due to the physisorbed moisture molecules, the second loss in the range 200–350°C is indicative of the combustion of the hexagonally packed surfactants, and the presence of sharp distinct weight loss around 600°C shows the decomposition of organic groups (benzene) in PMO. The DTA analysis (Fig. 3B) are correlated with TG results as exothermic peaks in the same regions of temperature. In solvent extracted PMOB [Fig. 3B(b)], only one peak at 600°C was observed, which indicates that surfactant is completely removed from the solvent extracted sample. The TG and DTA results of NH2@PMOB [Fig. 3A and B (c)] sample shows a peak around 280–350°C indicating the presence of aminopropyl groups. Further, the heterogeneous complex, Ru(II)Cym@PMOB [Fig. 3A & B(d)] shows a strong peak at 410°C be due to the decomposition of neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)2]2 complex from the parent PMOB. IR spectra help us to probe the attached functional groups and the behavior of the surface Si-OH groups in hybrid materials. It also gives valuable information about the incorporation of the phenyl-bridged groups into the pore wall. IR Spectra of a) as-synthesized PMOB, b) extracted PMOB, c) NH2@PMOB, d) neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex and (e) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB are plotted in Fig. 4 . Transition features at 1465, 2858, and 2960cm−1 in as-synthesized PMOB (Fig. 4a) corresponds to bending and stretching vibrations, respectively, of methylene groups in CTAB surfactant. After solvent extraction, these peaks disappear, signifying the complete elimination of surfactant from PMOB (Fig. 4b). In addition, broad peak at 3600–3200cm−1 is assigned to the ν-OH vibrations of surface Si-OH groups in PMOB. A sharp feature at 1628cm−1 reveals the bending OH frequency of Si-OH groups. Characteristic peaks of Si-O bond in siloxane framework (Fig. 4a–c, e) were observed at 798cm−1 (asymmetric) and 1080cm−1 (symmetric), and a peak at 960cm−1 is ascribed to ν(SiOH) frequencies. Evidence of aminogroups in NH2@PMOB was confirmed by the presence of peaks at 2965cm−1 and 2880cm−1 due to methylene group vibrations from NH2 functionalized propyl groups. The spectra of three peaks at around 656, 1459 and 3055cm−1 indicate δ(CH), υ (CC) and υ (CH) in benzene ring. The evidence for Si-C bond strength and the arrangement of phenyl groups within organosilica framework of all PMOB based material (Fig. 4a-c, e) are confirmed by peculiar peaks at 1168 and 2913cm−1 which corresponds to the framework phenyl CH bending and stretching vibrations, respectively [24]. p-cymene ligands in neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)2]2 complex (Fig. 4d) [14] were confirmed by the bending and stretching vibrations of CH3 groups in cymene ligands in the region of 1200–1500cm−1 and 3000–3200cm−1, respectively. Thus IR gave conclusive spectroscopic evidence that organomoities are inserted in PMOB successfully. 13C CPMASS NMR of (A) [(a) as-synthesized PMOB (b) extracted PMOB and (c) NH2@PMOB] and (B) [(a) neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex and (b) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB] are shown in Fig. 5 . In the as-synthesized PMOB [Fig. 5A(a)], peaks in the range of 70–10ppm, indicate the presence of C18-TAB and these resonances fully vanish in the spectra of extracted PMOB [Fig. 5A(b)], revealing the complete elimination of surfactant. After amino-functionalization, presence of peaks at 8, 25 and 41ppm, relates to propyl chain carbon atoms in organic linker, representing the organo-functionalization of PMOB [Fig. 5A(c)]. The neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex [Fig. 5B(a)] shows significant resonances, in the region of 128ppm to 150ppm, which corresponds to different set of carbon atoms of phenyl ring present in p-Cymene ligands. In addition to this, peaks at 13ppm, 20ppm and 55ppm are assigned to carbon atoms [CH3 and CH(CH3)2)] of methyl group present in p-Cymene ligands. After the grafting of neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex [Fig. 5B(b)] over modified PMOB, a sharp and intense peak at 132ppm [24] is ascribed to the phenyl carbon atoms in organosilica framework which overlap with the peaks observed in neat Ru dimeric complex. However, characteristic peak corresponding to CH3 group at 18ppm was retained [Fig. 5B(b)]. Solid state 29Si NMR spectra for the evaluation of degree of crosslinking in PMOB samples, of (a) as-synthesized PMOB, (b) extracted PMOB, (c) NH2@PMOB and (d) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB, are represented in Fig. 6 . The region corresponding to −60 to −90ppm is assigned to Tn signals which includes T3 at −83 [RSi(OSi)3], T2 at −74 [RSi(OSi)2(OH)] and T1 at −63 [RSi(OSi)(OH)2]. Peak intensity of extracted PMOB is prominent compared to as-synthesized PMOB owing to the high concentration of surface silanol groups. The utilization of isolated and geminal silanol groups reduces the intensity of T2 and T1 signals in NH2@PMOB with similar intensity in Ru(II)Cym@PMOB. The non-existence of Qn signals greater than −90ppm clearly portraits the Si-C bond in framework sustain even in harsh synthetic procedures. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy [27], a good tool for detecting the oxidation state and coordination atmosphere of atoms on the basis of binding energy shifts. XPS spectra of Ru 3p3/2 core level binding energies of (a) neat [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 complex and (b) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB are depicted in Fig. 7 and referenced to C1s peak at 285eV. BE of Ru 3p3/2of the neat [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 complex centered at 463.3eV and those peak is shifted into 462.9eV in Ru(II)Cym@PMOB owing to the influence of chemical environment around ruthenium metal. These results confirmed that the ruthenium species exhibits +2 oxidation state in their complexes, and proved not only the structural integrity of the ruthenium precursor but also the intact oxidation state of ruthenium in Ru(II)Cym@PMOB. DRS UV–vis spectra showed different electronic transitions possible in neat and heterogeneous complex. The DRS UV–vis. pattern of a) as-synthesized PMOB, b) extracted PMOB, c) NH2@PMOB, d) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB and (e) neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex are shown in Fig. 8 . In all organosilica materials [Fig. 8(a-d)], two peaks; first one at 220nm indicates the typical siliceous region and second one, 280nm assigns to Π→Π* transitions of phenyl ring in organosilica framework. In both neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 and Ru(II)Cym@PMOB catalysts, two characteristic regions; former one, between 300 and 360nm corresponding LMCT transition and latter one, in the range of 400–500nm due to d–d transition of Ru (II) species is observed. Moreover, a peculiar peak at 290nm in neat complex corresponds to Π→Π* transitions of benzene ring in p-cymene ligands is also observed. The surface morphology of synthesized materials was explained by SEM and TEM microscopy techniques. SEM and TEM images of (A) extracted PMOB and (B) Ru(II)Cym@PMOB are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. In SEM images, parent PMOB exhibits hexagonal structure which is preserved in Ru(II)Cym@PMOB after grafting process. TEM images shows that both material show 2D hexagonal uniform pore channels, and after complexation, the structure of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB is in intact with parent PMOB."
4,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Hydrogen transfer reactions [28,29] is one of the convenient approaches to synthesize secondary alcohols from acetophenones compared to conventional hydrogenation reactions where ketone hydrogenation was inhibited due to higher activation energies [30]. In transfer hydrogenation mechanism, Ru metal in heterogeneous catalyst abstract a hydride and a proton from 2-propanol and released into carbonyl groups of ketone to form secondary alcohols with the regeneration of active Ru(II)Cym@PMOB catalyst [31]. In this context, transfer hydrogenation reactions of different acetophenones were performed by using 2-propanol as solvent as well as H-donor and lower amount of KOH at 80°C for 6h. To tune the electronic and steric effects, various substituted phenyl methyl ketones such as 4-methyl acetophenone, 4-chloroacetopheneone, 2-nitroacetophenone and propiophenone were used for the catalytic activity of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB in transfer hydrogenation reaction (Table 2 ). All substrates, except electron donating and highly strained groups (entries 5, 8), gave >85% conversion where electron withdrawing groups (entries 4, 6, 7) such as Cl and NO2 are present. The electron donating and steric methyl group as in 4-methylacetophenone (55%) and propiophenone (67%) shows lower conversion. To optimize the reaction parameters, transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone by various amount of Ru content catalysts (Table 3 , entries1-3) and solvents (Table 3, entries 4–6) were carried out. Initial Turn Over Frequency (TOF) of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB catalyst in transfer hydrogenation reaction of ketones after 10min (<10%) was included in Table 2 and compared with TOF of acetophenone as model substrate (27h−1) after the completion of reaction (6h). The results show that initial reaction rate and TOF (10min) of transfer hydrogenation reactions are higher than TOF at 6h. To confirm the energy feasible pathway for the synthesis of secondary alcohols via. transfer hydrogenation reactions of ketones, conventional hydrogenation reactions of acetophenone using H2-gas was carried out and concluded that only 5% reaction (entry 2) occurred under the harsh reaction conditions. To highlight the heterogeneity of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB, hydrogen transfer reaction were executed with neat [RuCl2(p-Cymene)]2 complex (96%) and blank reactions (1%). The hydrogen transfer reactions was further monitored by time on stream conditions by using Ru(II)Cym@PMOB which is included in Fig. 11 . To optimize the reaction conditions, various amounts of Ru content catalysts and solvents were carried out (Table 3). The obtained results confirm that 2-propanol and 0.487mmol/g Ru catalysts are suitable reaction parameters for the same. Moreover, generally, alcohols are considered as better solvents for this reaction compared to other H-donors. Heterogeneity of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB catalyst were tested by Sheldon hot filtration test (Fig. 12 ) in hydrogen transfer reactions of acetophenone as model substrate. For this, transfer hydrogenation reaction was continued for 2h where conversion is 74%, and hot solution filtered and filtrate again charged into RB for further reactions up to 6h (80%). The results are compared with fresh cycle in Table 2 (entry 4) and confirmed that a negligible loss of ruthenium was observed in reaction process on the basis of conversion (6%) loss occurred between 2 and 6h. To check the reusability of Ru(II)Cym@PMOB catalyst, recycling studies were performed and the results are plotted in Fig. 13 . At first, fresh cycle of transfer hydrogenation reaction was carried out (97%). After the reaction, mixture was centrifuged, the residue was washed with 2-propanol and charged into round bottom flask for first cycle reactions (90%). The reaction was continued up to second cycle (80%). After second cycle, the reaction results exhibited that 17wt% of conversion loss was occurred from fresh cycle which indicates that 0.08mmol/g Ru metal (From ICP-AES results) was leaching out from the Ru(II)Cym@PMOB catalyst after second cycle."
5,Conclusion,"A robust heterogeneous catalyst based on Ru(II)Cym@PMOB for the preparation of 20 alcohols from acetophenones through hydrogen transfer reactions is reported. The heterogenized organocatalyst was found to be an active as homogeneous neat complex. To justify the significance of transfer hydrogenation reactions and its versatility, the reaction was also performed by conventional gas phase hydrogenation routes and the results confirmed that conversion of ketones to alcohols was poor due to its higher activation energy. A little or no leeching of ruthenium was confirmed by Sheldon’s hot filtration test."
