0,Introduction,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global health crisis affecting over 10 million people worldwide and causing over one million deaths per year [1]. Following infection bacteria are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and exposed to effector molecules and harmful enzymes within the phagosome [2,3]. Depending on the effectiveness of the host immune response, bacterium may be cleared or the host may succumb to infection. Current therapeutic regimens aim to control active disease through the use of antibiotics such as, isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) [2,4,5]. However the immune response to Mtb infection and therapeutics can vary depending on health vulnerabilities such as nutrient deficiency, and health risks including alcohol use and smoking (Table 1 ). While studies have traditionally investigated the impact of individual immune depressive factors, there is increasing evidence that the intersection of vulnerabilities, such as vitamin D3 deficiency and health risk behaviors like alcohol use disorders (AUD), may result in compounding negative immunological effects. Classically, vitamin D3 is associated with the absorption of calcium and phosphorous, however research into its non-classical role in immune regulation has become increasingly important, particularly given the high rates of vitamin D3 deficiency in the adult population [6–9]. Macrophages are known to express vitamin D3 receptors (VDR) and can produce the enzyme Cyp27B1 (1α-hydroxylase), which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to biologically active 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [7,10]. The modulation of immune response by vitamin D3, leads to a more effective innate and adaptive response. Studies dating back over a century found positive correlations between vitamin D3 supplementation and overall health of TB infected patients [2,11]. Vitamin D3 has been observed to have a profound effect on the production of several key immune regulating cytokines and effector molecules (Table 1). Vitamin D3 promotes activation of macrophage cells and the formation of multinucleated giant cells, commonly present in TB granulomas [12]. Our current study, as well as previous studies by others, have observed that exposing host cells to vitamin D3 results in enhanced immune response to infection and greater host cell preservation (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) [2,3,12–14]. While previous studies have provided key insights regarding vitamin D3 modulation of host response, many of these studies failed to investigate common comorbidities associated with malnutrition [3,13–20]. Malnutrition and alcoholism have long correlated with suboptimal immune function and efficacy, with alcohol commonly associated with a detrimentally upregulated inflammatory response [21]. Acute binge drinking, as well as moderate drinking can have a large effect on the immune system [22]. Chronic alcohol exposure has been shown to interfere with the functions of essential vitamins and nutrients, including folic acid and vitamins D, C, and E, but these studies are few and fail to investigate the compounding effect of alcohol exposure, impaired vitamin function, and infection [23–26]. Proper controls in our previous study necessitated the use of ethanol as a vehicle control and while other results suggested that the effect of alcohol was negligible, we found a bacterial load-dependent dysregulation associated with alcohol exposure. Alcohol, even in small concentrations had a noticeable effect on macrophage behavior and cytokine production, resulting in increased H2O2, NO, and cytotoxicity, as well as negative correlations between bacterial load and IL-12 production [27]. While recognized that alcohol exposure decreases the efficacy of vitamin D3, most studies fail to extend beyond alcohol use's effects on classical vitamin D3 functions [23,24,26,28]. Our current study addresses several of the limitations of previous vitamin D3 studies and investigates the impact of in vivo deficiency on immune response during infection given exogenous vitamin D3 supplementation or alcohol exposure. We coupled an in vivo vitamin D3 deficiency model and an ex vivo Mycobacterium bovis BCG murine infection model to quantify the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation and alcohol exposure on immune response during infection. In our study we utilized M. bovis Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) infection of murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) as a surrogate for Mtb infection. M. bovis BCG is commonly used as a model organism for the study of Mtb [29], and while it does not capture all aspects of TB disease, it has been used to capture multiple features of TB disease, such as macrophage function and bacterial response during stress [16,30]. BCG is typically not harmful to humans when compared to M. tuberculosis, but acts pathogenically in mice in a similar manner as Mtb. We chose to utilize the inbred laboratory strain C57BL/6 mice as our animal model to enable the development of an in vivo vitamin D3 deficiency model, and to minimize effects due to genetic variations in host [31–33]. BMDMs, which are more abundant and readily generated from mice, were used in lieu of alveolar macrophages. Given that the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D3 represents a non-classical, atypical response to potentially unregulated infection, the recruitment of circulating immune cells, such as bone marrow originating monocytes, to control infection is highly plausible. Compared to prior observations in murine cell lines, in our current study the effect of alcohol exposure was found to more profoundly dysregulate primary murine macrophages, with ethanol exposed cells generally characterized as hyper- or hyporesponsive. In vivo diet was the greatest determinant of immune response, and while exogenous vitamin D3 supplementation had a normative effect on diet deficient host, supplementation was not sufficient to compensate for the effects of diet deficiency."
1,Methods,
2,In vivo vitamin D3 deficiency model,"2.1 In vivo vitamin D3 deficiency model Three-week old C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Labs) were fed TD89123 vitamin D3 deficient diet (Harlan-Teklad) or TD89124 vitamin D3 sufficient control diet for 13 weeks. TD.89124 diet is considered to be a normal diet and provides all the necessary nutrients for healthy rodent growth. Mice were weighted once a week and weight was recorded. At 16 weeks of age mice were sacrificed and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were collected. BMDMs were matured for 6–7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% multi-clonal stimulation factor, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (pen/strep), and 1% l-glutamine. BMDM cells were dislodged from plate by gentle pipetting and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min and then resuspended to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM complete without pen/strep. Cells were distributed to 24-well plates and incubated for 2 h to allow adherence."
3,"Ex vivo infection, vitamin D3 supplementation, and alcohol exposure models","2.2 Ex vivo infection, vitamin D3 supplementation, and alcohol exposure models 2.2.1 Bacterial culture M. bovis (BCG; gifted from Graviss Lab, Houston Methodist Research Institute, TX) was grown from frozen stock in Middlebrook 7H9 media using Hardy Diagnostics 7H9 dehydrated culture media (C6301), containing 0.2% glycerol, 10% OADC and 0.05% Tween-80. After undergoing one subculture bacteria was grown to late log phase and used to infect host cells. 2.2.2 Ex vivo infection models DMEM complete without pen/strep was prepared containing either (1) 4 ng/ml of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, (2) an equivalent amount of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 solvent, 0.8% ethanol, or (3) control media (Fig. 1A). Molecular biological grade ethanol was used as a secondary control for the vitamin D3 solvent, to model alcohol exposure and investigate the effects of ethanol on the system. Vitamin D3 deficient and sufficient diet BMDM cells in their appropriate exposure media (vitD3, ethanol, or control) were infected at an MOI of 1:1 host cells to bacteria (BCG). Study was performed in triplicate. BCG was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min and then resuspended to a desired concentration in the DMEM complete with or without vitamin D3/ethanol. The supernatant was removed from 24-well plates and replaced with control, vitamin D3 or ethanol containing media. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. After infection was complete supernatant was removed and host cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS), then control, vitamin D3 or ethanol media containing 50 μg/ml of gentamicin was added to wells followed by 14 h of incubation. After incubation with gentamicin, plates were washed with PBS twice and fresh control, vitamin D3 or ethanol containing media was added to appropriate cells. Cells were then incubated for 120 h."
4,Sample collection and immune response quantification,"2.3 Sample collection and immune response quantification Samples were collected at hour 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h post infection. Imaging occurred using an Olympus CKX41 microscope immediately prior to every sample collection time point (Fig. 2 D). This experiment was replicated three times, resulting in three trial groups per condition. 2.3.1 Quantification of bacterial load At hours 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 post infection, supernatant from the 24-well plate was collected and serially diluted 10-fold. Dilutions were then plated on 7H11 agar plates (C6292, Hardy Diagnostics) to quantify the extracellular bacterial load. Wells were washed once with PBS then incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, to allow cells to lyse. The lysate was then collected, serially diluted 10-fold, and plated on 7H11 agar plates to quantify intracellular bacterial load. After 16 days incubation, countable colony forming units (CFU) were enumerated to determine extracellular and intracellular bacterial load. It should be noted that at hour 0 extracellular counts were present; this may be caused by inefficiency of gentamicin to fully eradicate BCG infection, though it does lower bacterial counts significantly (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1). Supernatant not utilized for CFU counts was stored in −80 °C and later used for cytokine and reactive species quantification. 2.3.2 Cytokine and effector assays Using supernatant collected from 24-well plates (Fig. 2B shows immune response variables measured), 25(OH) Vitamin D ELISA (ENZO, ADI-900-215-0001) was performed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions with a sensitivity range 0.5–1010 ng/ml. Griess reagent (Promega, G2930) was utilized to quantify NO2– concentrations. LDH cytotoxicity assay (Pierce, 88954), performed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, was used to quantify cell death. Known concentrations of host cells were lysed and their corresponding LDH concentrations used to generate a linear regression subsequently applied to LDH assay readings from experimental samples to determine amount of cell death. Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Abcam, ab102500) was utilized to quantify H2O2 concentrations. To quantify IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, KC/GRO, and TNF-α concentrations over time, a V-PLEX proinflammatory panel (MSD, K15048D) was utilized."
5,Data analysis,"2.4 Data analysis 2.4.1 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB [76]. Using data from the three trials we performed outlier analysis and normalized the data to vitamin D3 sufficient diet control cells (Suf) at each time point within each assay. After normalization values were averaged together and the standard error of the mean was calculated. Welch's t-test was performed for each time window (0–120, 24 h time window intervals) and for all time points combined (0–120, without windowed intervals) to identify statistically significant variations in immune response between experimental conditions. Rate of change over time was calculated using non-normalized data and the results normalized to results from Suf control cells. Pearson correlation analysis was applied to non-normalized data to calculate correlations between cytokines and effector molecules. 2.4.2 Linear mixed model analysis The immune response data included multiple repeated measures that are correlated within each experimental sample (18 experimental samples corresponding to 6 conditions times three trials). Therefore we analyzed the data using a two-level Linear Mixed Model (LMM) using the method of residual restricted maximum likelihood with a first-order autoregressive covariance (AR(1)) structure to model autocorrelated errors. For Level 1 analysis, the within-condition level, the repeated immune response measurements (Fig. 1B) were expressed as a regression function based on collection time (i.e., hours from the first collection). Differences in the Level-1 immune response profiles were then used to account for the random variation across experiments in the Level 2 model. The LMM, which models both random effects and fixed effects, enables the level-2 equations to model the slope coefficients from the level-1 predictors as the outcomes for the level-2 predictors. Due to the small sample size of 18 experimental samples and the large number of possible predictors (12 assays including cytokines, chemokines, NO, and vitamin D), the LMM models could not converge when all 12 assays were included in the model. In Step 1 of the analysis, a LMM that included all 12 assays was generated for each of the four outcome variables of interest (intracellular, extracellular, sum of intra and extracellular bacterial load, LDH/cytotoxicity) to identify assays that had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the prediction of each of the four outcomes; these were termed significant predictors. The LMM analysis used a natural log transformation of the outcome variables. During Step 2 of the analysis, generation of the complete model, the significant predictors identified in Step 1 along with the two effects of diet (termed cond1) and treatment (termed cond2; control/no treatment, vitamin D3 supplementation, or alcohol exposure) were used as inputs to the Level 2 model. For all statistical tests, significance levels were set at p < 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc. 2014 Cary, NC)."
6,Results,"Building on previous findings regarding the impact of in vitro vitamin D3 supplementation on the bioavailability and rate of production of key cytokines and effector molecules, we found in vivo vitamin D3 deficiency to have the greatest effect on cytokine and effector production. Exogenous supplementation had a secondary, more moderate effect on the relative concentration and rate of change of immune response molecules."
7,Vitamin D3 sufficient diet promotes reduced host cell death while maintaining bacterial loads comparable to vitamin D3 deficient diet cells,"3.1 Vitamin D3 sufficient diet promotes reduced host cell death while maintaining bacterial loads comparable to vitamin D3 deficient diet cells M. bovis BCG CFUs determined from 7H11 plating of diluted samples collected over time showed that Vitamin D3 deficient diet greatly impacted initial intracellular BCG loads. The intracellular loads of vitamin D3 sufficient (Suf) and deficient (Def) control were statistically significantly different. Cells originating from vitamin D3 sufficient mice were found to have almost 3-fold less relative bacterial CFUs than Def conditioned cells at 0 h (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 1). When comparing Suf and Def conditioned cells it was evident at 0, 24, 48 and 96 h post infection that in vivo diet played a large roll in intracellular load with Def having between 1.5 and 3 fold greater bacterial load. Extracellular bacterial load was also impacted by vitamin D3 diet deficiency (Fig. 2B, Table 2 ). At all time points except 24 and 96 h, extracellular load of Suf conditioned cells had less bacterial load than Def and was found to be statistically significantly different (p < 0.05, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). Extracellular and intracellular BCG load clearance appeared to be negatively impacted by the exogenous addition of vitamin D3 and ethanol, resulting in less controlled infection. The vitamin D3 sufficient diet's reduced bacterial load is negated by the exogenous addition of vitamin D3 and ethanol. At several time points (intracellular:0, 24, 48, 72, 96 h, extracellular: 0, 48, 72, 96 h) we observed that Suf+EtOH conditioned cells' bacterial CFU values exceeded Suf cells, further supporting our initial supposition that exogenous addition of alcohol negatively impacts bacterial clearance. The intracellular load for Suf+EtOH cells was found to be statistically significantly different from Suf (p < 0.05, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). We found similar trends with vitamin D3 deficient diet but with less frequency. The bacterial load of Def+EtOH exceeded that of Def (intracellular: 72, 96 h, extracellular: 0, 72 h). These results suggest that while diet-associated vitamin D3 sufficiency has a positive effect on bacterial load clearance, the exogenous addition of vitamin D3 dissolved in ethanol interferes with and potentially hinders bacterial clearance. Differences in diet and exogenous vitamin D3 supplementation/alcohol exposure were also evident in cellular cytotoxicity, which showed a clear difference in LDH levels (used to quantify host cell cytotoxicity) between in vivo diets (Fig. 2C). Diet-dependent cytotoxic response differed from 24 h post infection onward, with Suf cells having the least amount of cell death when compared to Def. Within each respective diet we see a distinct pattern in which Suf/Def cells exhibit the least cytotoxicity and Suf+EtOH/Def+EtOH exhibit the greatest level of cytotoxicity. Vitamin D3 sufficient diets (Suf, Suf+VitD, Suf+EtOH) had lower amounts of cell death than their counterparts (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH), ranging from 1.15 to 2.46 fold increase over Suf cells. The resulting cytotoxicity experienced by Suf+VitD/Def+VitD and Suf+EtOH/Def+EtOH conditions further support our supposition regarding the harmful effect of alcohol on cell immune response."
8,Effector molecules are differentially modulated by vitamin D3 diet and supplementation,"3.2 Effector molecules are differentially modulated by vitamin D3 diet and supplementation Utilizing a colorimetric assay we determined vitamin D3 and NO concentration dynamics during cellular response to infection. As expected host cells treated with vitamin D3 exogenously exhibited the highest concentration of vitamin D3 (Def+VItD, Suf+VitD). An unexpected result was the excessive concentrations of vitamin D3 observed throughout for Def+VitD cells (1.5–2.25 fold greater than Suf, Fig. 3 A). This observation may be due to the difficulty of detecting the receptor bound form of vitamin D3 using the ELISA assay, or may hint at improved utilization of the vitamin by sufficient cells, though further testing would be required to substantiate this hypothesis. We found that the Def+VitD cells' vitamin D3 concentrations were statistically significantly different from all other conditions (Fig. 3A, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). Similar to the findings in our previous study the divergent production of nitric oxide (NO) between conditions is temporally associated [27]. We observed larger differences between conditions at later time points and more similarities in NO production at earlier time points (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 2). From 48 h onward diet-associated differences in NO production became apparent, with vitamin D3 sufficient diet conditions producing less NO than their vitamin D3 deficient counterparts. Further separation between the conditions occurred within each diet, with vitamin D3 supplemented cells (Def+VitD, Suf+VitD) producing the least amount of NO from 48 to 120 h and ethanol exposed cells (Def+EtOH, Suf+EtOH) producing the highest concentrations from 48 to 120 h. Similar patterns were observed in our previous study using in vitro conditioned cell lines and M. smegmatis. In the current study we found NO production by Suf+VitD cells to be significantly different from Suf+EtOH, Def+EtOH, Suf, and Def cells (Fig. 3B, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). Our findings reaffirm our previous conclusion that vitamin D3 supplementation as well as alcohol exposure can directly modulate the production of reactive nitrogen species, with upregulation by alcohol potentially resulting in detrimental outcomes for the host cell given NO's toxicity and ability to easily diffuse across the phagocytic membrane."
9,Proinflammatory cytokines present with two very distinctive responses to vitamin D3 deficiency,"3.3 Proinflammatory cytokines present with two very distinctive responses to vitamin D3 deficiency 3.3.1 IL-12, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-2 We used a multiplex ELISA assay to quantify IL-12, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-2 production over time. Our previous studies found IL-12 to be highly regulated by vitamin D3 in murine cell lines with production changing in response to infection level when vitamin D3 was present. Other studies have found IL-1β to be highly regulated by vitamin D3 in humans but studies in mice were inconclusive (Table 1) [27]. Similar to NO production and cytotoxicity, proinflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-1β, and IFN-γ production was differentiated heavily by diet and moderately by exogenous supplementation. IL-12, IL-1β, and IFN-γ followed a similar trend as that observed in NO in which vitamin D3 sufficient diet (Suf, Suf+VitD), with the exclusion of Suf+EtOH, produced lower levels of the cytokine compared to vitamin D3 deficient conditions (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH). For IL-12 and IFN-γ production at 96 and 120 h, Suf+EtOH exceeds that of all other conditions. Exogenous supplementation of cells in addition to diet resulted in further stratification of IL-12 and IL-1β with Suf+EtOH/Def+EtOH cells producing the highest levels and Suf+VitD/Def+VitD cells producing the lowest levels within their respective diets (Fig. 4 A and B, Supplementary Fig. 3). Supporting these observations we found that IL-12 production by Suf cells was significantly different from Def, Suf+EtOH, and IL-12 production by Suf+VitD was significantly different from Def+VitD, Suf+EtOH (Fig. 4A, Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). For IL-1β production, Suf and Suf+VitD were significantly different from Def, Def+EtOH, Def+VitD (Fig. 4B, Table 2). Vitamin D3 supplemented cells produced the least IFN-γ (Def+VitD at 24, 48, 72, 120 h and Suf+VitD at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 h), Def produced the most (at 0, 24, 48, 72), and Suf+VitD was significantly different from all other vitamin D3 deficient conditions (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1). The effect of diet on IL-2 production followed a similar trend as IFN-γ from 0 to 48 h but diverges after 48 h with Suf+VitD producing the greatest amount of IL-2 at 72 h, 120 h and Suf+EtOH producing the highest concentration at 96 h. IL-2 production in Suf conditioned cells was significantly different from Def, Def+VitD, and Def+EtOH conditions (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1). In all cases with IL-12, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-2 Suf conditioned cells were found to be statistically significantly different from Def cells (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1). The clear Suf versus Def skew in cytokine production is indicative of the overarching effect of diet on the establishment of a baseline or normative pro-inflammatory response. Although diet was the main differentiator, alcohol related dysregulation was apparent even for sufficient diets, with Suf+EtOH exhibiting a large increase in rate of production at 96 h and continuing to produce the highest IL-12, IFN-γ and second highest level of IL-2 at 120 h (Fig. 4, Supplementary Tables 1–3). 3.3.2 KC/GRO, TNF-α, and IL-6 KC/GRO, TNF-α, and IL-6 exhibited a very different response to vitamin D3 deficient and sufficient diet during infection in comparison to other proinflammatory cytokines. Their concentration and rate of production were positively correlated to one another across all conditions (Table 3 , Supplementary Tables 1–3). Consistent with our previous study, a distinction between vitamin D3 sufficient and deficient diet cytokine production was only observed for the 0 h time point (Fig. 5 , Supplementary Fig. 4). The diet-dependent skew observed for other proinflammatory cytokines was only apparent at 0 h for this group of cytokines, with vitamin D3 deficient diets producing higher levels than vitamin D3 sufficient diets. Sufficient diet cells supplemented with vitamin D3 (Suf+VitD) produced the lowest initial concentrations of KC/GRO, TNF-α, and IL-6 at 0 h. At 24hr production by Def and Def+VitD cells was similar and greater than all other conditions by 1.25 fold. However, by 48 h Def+VitD decreased and Def maintained a 1.25 fold increase through 96 h (TNF-α) and 120 h (KC/GRO, IL-6). For IL-6 all deficient diet conditions (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH) were significantly different from sufficient diet counterparts (Suf, Suf+VitD, Suf+EtOH), with Suf+VitD also differing significantly from Suf (Fig. 5C, Table 2). For KC/GRO Def was significantly different from all Suf conditions (Fig. 5A, Table 2)."
10,Anti-inflammatory cytokine production is affected by in vivo vitamin D3 deficient diet but supplementation has notable effects,"3.4 Anti-inflammatory cytokine production is affected by in vivo vitamin D3 deficient diet but supplementation has notable effects Utilizing the multiplex ELISA assay we quantified IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 production over time. Consistent with our observations for the proinflammatory cytokines and NO, anti-inflammatory production was influenced heavily by diet (Figs. 3B, 4 and 6 ). Vitamin D3 sufficient diet (Suf, Suf+VitD, Suf+EtOH) produced the least of all three cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) overall when compared to deficient diet cells, with Suf+VitD producing the minimum at all time intervals. Def cells' production of IL-4, IL-10, IL-5 was vastly different from that of Suf cells, with Def cells producing 1.25–1.75 fold, 1.25–2.4 fold, 1.5–3.5 fold, respectively, more than Suf cells. At 96 and 120 h for Suf+EtOH cells anti-inflammatory cytokine production observably increased from 0.8 to 1.5 fold increase to a fold increase of 1.4–3.0 (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 5). For IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 Suf+VitD is significantly different from all other conditions (Fig. 6; Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). Suf cells differed significantly for all three cytokines when compared to Def, Def+EtOH and Suf+VitD. Suggesting that vitamin D3 supplementation irrespective of the modulatory effects of its vehicle ethanol, in general supplemented cells were able to act independent of and in conjunction with diet to produce the lowest concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines within each diet condition. Vitamin D3 diet does not appear to preferentially skew the host cells toward an M1 or M2 response, as cytokine production seems to be categorically down regulated at the majority of time points for Suf diet cells. Even with this apparent downregulation of both anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokine production Suf cells still maintain the lowest amount of cytotoxicity from 48 to 120 h."
11,Role of cytokines as predictors of immune response outcomes is diet dependent,"3.5 Role of cytokines as predictors of immune response outcomes is diet dependent 3.5.1 Significant predictors vary by diet We used a two-level LMM to determine which immune response variables were predictive of host response driven outcome of M. bovis BCG infection given diet, supplementation, or alcohol exposure. Separate LMMs were generated including: (1) an LMM for each immune response outcome of interest: bacterial load (extracellular, intracellular, and combined intra-plus extracellular bacterial load) and LDH (host cell cytotoxicity); and (2) LMMs using data from combined/all diets, data from mice on vitamin D3 deficient diet (89123), and data from mice on vitamin D3 sufficient diet (89124). The combinations of (1) and (2) resulted in the generation of 12 different LMMs (Supplementary Tables 4–6). Table 4 lists the identified significant predictors (Level 1 LMM) for each of the quantified immune response outcomes (intra, extra, sum of intra and extra, and LDH) by diet (coefficients for Suf and Def graphically depicted in Supplementary Fig. 6). Diverse sets of assays emerged as significant predictors in an outcome and diet-associated manner, with: Def diet predictors (NO, IL-10, IL-1β,TNF-α) overlapping with combined (Def and Suf) diet predictors (NO, IL-10, IL-1β, KC/GRO TNF-α), but differing from the relatively few Suf diet predictors (IL-5, TNF-α). Immune response outcome predictors were similar between the combined diet and deficient diet models, with KC/GRO emerging as a significant predictor when the diets were combined. Very few significant predictors were identified for the sufficient diet, with only IL-5 and TNF-α emerging as significant predictors of infection outcome for the sufficient diet, and IL-5 being the only differentiating predictor for deficiency. Of the eleven assays that have a significant correlation to outcomes of interest (Table 3, Supplementary Tables 4–5), all six of the significant predictors in the LMM level 1 model appear as having significant correlations with outcomes of interest. While four significant predictors (NO, IL-10, IL-1β, TNF-α) emerged for intracellular load for the combined or deficient data set, only TNF-α under sufficient diet had significant correlations to intracellular load. NO is correlated with extracellular load for both diets under alcohol exposure, however it only emerges as a significant predictor for the deficient diet for total bacterial load. Although IL-1β, KC/GRO, and TNF-α are the only predictors identified for the LDH outcome in the LMM analysis, all predictors in the LMMs had significant correlations to LDH outcome regardless of diet, except NO and KC/GRO which correlated to LDH under Def conditions. In sum, mainly for deficient and combined diets four predictors (NO, KC/GRO, IL-1β, TNF-α) had some consistency between the LMM-based immune response outcomes they associate with and statistically significant correlations with the same outcomes. The relatively lower number of significant predictors for the sufficient diet mirrors the reduced number of correlations between immune response assays and outcomes for the sufficient diet. 3.5.2 Combined diet and treatment LMM reveal IL-1β, TNF-α as key effectors of immune outcome under deficiency Supplementary Table 4 shows the parameter estimates of fixed effects when experimental data from all diets and all conditions were included in the LMM. For intracellular bacterial load, IL-1β accounted for a statistically significant negative reduction (βIL-1β = −0.0008, p < 0.001) and the effect of TNF-α on intracellular load differed significantly by diet (βdiet*TNF-α = −0.0002, p = 0.0358). For extracellular load, time (βtime = 0.0148, p < 0.0001) and IL-1βΒ (βIL-1β = −0.0004, p = 0.0309) were positively and negatively related to extracellular bacteria levels. For the total bacterial load (Table 5 ), results mirrored that of the LMM model for intracellular load. IL-1β contributed negatively to combined load (βIL-1β = −0.0008, p = 0.0093) and the effect of TNF-α differed significantly by diet (βdiet*TNF-α = −0.0002, p = 0.0185). For the LDH LMM, as expected the positive slope associated with time (βt = 0.0101, p < 0.001), concurred that the LDH levels increased over the course of infection. Compared with the control treatment group, alcohol exposure and vitamin D3 exposure had negative or a reductive effect on LDH levels (βetoh = −0.739, p = 0.0082; βvitd = −0.5872, p = 0.0314), which is most consistent with observations at early time points post infection. Vitamin D 3 deficient LMM. None of the previously identified predictors, time, or treatment effect, had significant effects on intracellular load (Supplementary Table 5). Other than the temporally associated positive increase of extracellular load (βtime = 0.008, p = 0.026) and LDH (βtime = 0.019, p < 0.001), IL-10 and IL-1β were the only other notable predictors of infection outcome for Def cells. IL-10 and IL-1β positively and negatively, respective, affected total bacterial load (βIL-10 = 0.0033, p = 0.025; βIL-1β = −0.0009, p = 0.025). Vitamin D 3 sufficient LMM. For intracellular and total bacterial load, no significant predictors were identified for the vitamin D3 sufficient diet's immune outcome variables (Supplementary Table 6). Similar to the Def LMM, the temporal increase of extracellular bacterial load was statistically significant (βtime = 0.0147, p = 0.012). The LMM analysis for Suf showed that in addition to temporally increasing, TNF-α had a significant positive effect on LDH levels (βtime = 0.0131, p < 0.0001; βTNF-α = 0.0001, p = 0.04). TNF-α in conjunction with vitamin D3 supplementation or alcohol exposure was found to have an increasing effect relative to control on LDH (βTNF-α*etoh = 0.0002, p = 0.008; βTNF-α*vitd = 0.0002, p = 0.002)."
12,Correlations in immune response have a diet dependent skew,"3.6 Correlations in immune response have a diet dependent skew We examined correlations between assays within each condition using non-normalized concentration and rate of change data; correlations with a p-value of p < 0.05 are reported (Table 3). Results showed condition-associated trends in correlation. Deficient diet cells had the most significant correlations overall (56) while Suf+EtOH had the least (37) (Table 3). The reduced correlation in Suf+EtOH may further support our hypothesis regarding the dysregulating effect of alcohol, which we expand on in the discussion. Cytotoxicity was found to be positively correlated for all conditions to IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5. Cytotoxicity was positively correlated to KC/GRO for Def and Def+EtOH, and to IL-6, TNF-α for Def cells. These correlations suggest a close tie between cytotoxicity and cytokines stratified by in vivo diet conditioning (Figs. 4 and 6). IL-6, TNF-α, and KC/GRO varied most significantly at 0 h but do show some differences in concentration in Def diet cells, which is reflected in the correlation to cytotoxicity. NO correlations appeared most prevalent in vitamin D3 sufficient diet conditions (Suf, Suf+VitD, Suf+EtOH) with NO production positively correlating to IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 production. IFN-γ positively correlated to cytotoxicity, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 for all conditions. Similarly, IL-12 positively correlated to cytotoxicity, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 for all conditions. TNF-α positively correlated to IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 for all vitamin D3 deficient diet conditions (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH). Interestingly IL-6 production correlated positively to intracellular (Suf, Suf+VitD) and extracellular (Suf) BCG bacterial load, tying the correlation between IL-6 and bacterial load to in vivo vitamin D3 bioavailability. We found no statistically significant negative correlations for concentration of immune response variables. Our non-normalized concentration correlations were mainly positive and often spanned across all conditions. However, the rate of change correlations were found primarily in vitamin D3 deficient diet cells, with Def cells having the most rate of change correlations (37) and Suf+EtOH cells having the least (16). Non-normalized rate of change data presented with numerous diet dependent correlations. IL-5 had positive rate of change correlations in sufficient diet cells only with IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4(Suf, Suf+VitD, Suf+EtOH), IL-1β (Suf+VitD), IL-2 (Suf), IL-10 (Suf, Suf+VitD). Notably, there were no IL-5 associated correlations for deficient conditions. Intracellular and extracellular BCG bacterial load rates of change were positively correlated for Suf+EtOH and Suf+VitD conditioned cells. Cytotoxicity and NO rates of change positively correlated for Def+EtOH Rates of change for KC/GRO, TNF-α, and IL-6 were positively correlated to each other, for every condition. We observed some negative correlations for rate of change, whereas there were none for the non-normalized concentration dataset. The majority of negative correlations were associated with the vitamin D assay results. Negative correlations occurred between vitamin D3 assay and IL-5 rates of change for Def and Suf cells but not their supplemented or alcohol exposed counterparts (Suf+VitD, Suf+EtOH, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH), indicating a possible disruption of vitamin D3 associated interactions by the addition of ethanol, the vitamin D3 solvent. Vitamin D rate of change assay results were found to negatively correlate with IL-12 for Suf diet cells, a result which is supported heavily in literature and consistent with our prior observations for in vitro studies using low levels of mycobacterial infection (MOI 1:1) [77]. Negative rate of change correlations were observed between vitamin D levels and IFN-γ for Suf and Suf+VitD; this relationship is corroborated by previous studies conducted predominately with T cells."
13,Discussion,"In the current extension of our study we examined the effects of in vivo vitamin D3 deficiency on ex vivo M. bovis BCG infection and supplementation/alcohol exposure. We found that while exogenous conditioning of the cells did result in altered macrophage behavior, in vivo diet was the greatest determinant of cytokine and effector molecule production in response to bacterial challenge. The ramifications of extended in vivo vitamin D3 deficiency had a lasting effect on host immune responsiveness, which persisted nearly two-weeks post cell isolation (12 days, including 7 days of ex vivo maturation plus 5 days infection study). For all anti-inflammatory cytokines diet was the greatest determinant for differences in concentration and rate of change of immune response variables; this diet-based distinction occurred for the majority of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-2). However, exogenous supplementation of vitamin D3 or ethanol exposure further stratified cytokine/effector production."
14,Analysis of vitamin D3 associated cytokine signaling and crosstalk,"4.1 Analysis of vitamin D3 associated cytokine signaling and crosstalk Using correlations from both non-normalized concentration and rate of change data we identified several instances in which diet and supplementation influenced the relationship between cytokines. In some cases correlations were more prevalent in vitamin D3 sufficient diet cells (IL-5 rate of change), in deficient diet cells (IL-1β, IL-6 rates of change), or held across all conditions (concentrations of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-5, IFN-γ, IL-2). By examining differences and commonalities among diet or supplementation associated correlations we were able to characterize the mechanistic action of vitamin D3 and the immunological impact of deficiency/sufficiency. Using the presence or absence of diet associated correlations as a guide, we identified commonalities and differences in cytokine related signaling pathways and their components using the NetPath database [78]. Among cytokine correlations that held across all diet conditions (concentrations of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-5, IFN-γ, IL-2) we identified which components were present among the majority of cytokine pathways. The same analysis was applied to correlations that stratified by diet (IL-5, IL-1β, IL-6 rates of change). Using this comparative approach we eliminated non-correlation and non-diet associated components, and organized resulting components into functional groups (Fig. 7 , Supplementary Fig. 7) related to cytokines differentially modulated by vitamin D3. While there are additional known links between cytokines analyzed and functional groups, connections shown are relevant to diet-associated correlations and suggest possible mechanisms through which vitamin D3 is able to modulate immune response to mycobacterium infection."
15,Vitamin D3 modulates connections between signaling pathways,"4.2 Vitamin D3 modulates connections between signaling pathways 4.2.1 IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 signaling pathways disrupted in vitamin D3 sufficient cells IL-1β receptor is known to stimulate the production of IL-6 and TNF-α. We found that IL-1β correlates to IL-6 and TNF-α in Def diet cells only, but correlates to all Def conditions for KC/GRO (Def, Def+VItD, Def+EtOH). From these results we presume that vitamin D3, introduced both through diet and supplementation, as well as, alcohol exposure, disrupts or interferes with the pathway connecting IL-1β with TNF-α and IL-6. Vitamin D3 is a known inhibitor of NF-κB, a modulator down stream of the IL-1β receptor that leads to the transcription of TNF-α and IL-6 [79]. While vitamin D3 is widely accepted as an NF-κB inhibitor the role of alcohol in relation to NF-κB is not yet clear. Some studies report that alcohol is able to downregulate the production of NF-κB, this downregulation might explain the decreased production of TNF-α, IL-6, and KC/GRO in Def+EtOH cells, which was below that of Def cells [80]. NF-κB is also thought to be downregulated by vitamin D3 during infection [81]. We have identified two components (NFKBIA, MAPK3K7) contained in the signaling pathway of some of the pro-inflammatory cytokines we found to be modulated by vitamin D3. NFKBIA, an inhibitor of NF-κB, is associated with the signal pathways for IL-5, IL-1β, and IL-6. MAPK3K7, a positive regulator of NF-κB, is found in the signaling pathway of IL-6 and IL-1β. These components and their regulation may help explain the mechanism through which vitamin D3 downregulates NF-κB within the system. We also found that IL-6 is positively correlated to IL-12 in Def diet cells only (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH). IL-6 has been shown to inhibit SOCS3 and SOCS3 has been shown to inhibit the production of IL-12 [82,83]. The lack of IL-6/IL-12 correlation for Suf diet cells suggests that vitamin D3 sufficiency in vivo may disrupt IL-6 mediated inhibition of SOCS3, therefore disrupting IL-6 downstream effect on IL-12. Across all conditions IL-12 positively correlates to IFN-γ, IL-4 to IFN-γ, and IL-12 to IL-4. Previous studies have found the IL-12 may auto-stimulate the endogenous production of IFN-γ in macrophage cells [83,84], but it is not yet known if IL-12 is able to influence the production of IL-4. 4.2.2 IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-γ correlations present in vitamin D3 sufficient diet cells Our results found that vitamin D3 supplementation in conjunction with vitamin D3 sufficient diet, resulted in a decrease in anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines below that of ethanol exposed (Suf+EtOH) and often below unconditioned cells as well (Suf). The rate of change of IL-5 positively correlated with the rate of change of IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4 in Suf diet cells, indicating IL-5 is able to affect both the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways. Additionally we found that vitamin D3's rate of change was negatively correlated to IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-γ for Suf diet cells. Previous studies have found IL-5 stimulates the upregulation of the IL-2Rβ chain [85] (Fig. 7). IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5 may be produced through the same pathway in macrophages [86]. Though IFN-γ is primarily produced by T-cells, several studies have reported that infected macrophages are able to produce small quantities of IFN-γ for the purpose of auto-stimulation. IFN-γ was found to be positively correlated to cytotoxicity, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 for all conditions [83]. IFN-γ production in T-cells is commonly associated with the presence of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12, however we only observed IL-12 as positively correlated with IFN-γ over all conditions. Previous works have proposed that macrophages express an IL-12 receptor and are potentially able to upregulate their own IL-12 production and produce small amounts of IFN-γ through this receptor [83,87]. This potential mechanism may explain the positive correlation between IL-12 and IFN-γ, however additional studies exploring the endogenous production of IFN-γ by macrophages are needed to further clarify these interactions."
16,Modulation of bacterial clearance mechanisms,"4.3 Modulation of bacterial clearance mechanisms 4.3.1 Vitamin D3 impacts adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins IL-5 showed rate of change correlations primarily in vitamin D3 sufficient diet, therefore we focused on pathway components unique to IL-5 and examined possible mechanisms related to our findings and findings from other studies. We recurrently discovered adhesion and cytoskeleton proteins, most notably CTNNB1, ICAM3, IL-2RB (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 7). Previous studies have found that vitamin D3 plays a large role in the bioavailability of CTNNB1, which is heavily involved in the Wnt pathway [88], ICAM3, a ligand for lymphocyte function associated antigen 1 [89], and IL-2RB, an IL-2 receptor [81]. These components may contribute to phagocytosis-associated bacterial clearance, which is a mechanism potentially modulated by vitamin D3 and could contribute to the differences in bacterial load between the conditions. We noted that ethanol suppresses adhesion molecules necessary for phagosome formation, which is consistent with the high extracellular load present in ethanol exposed cells [90]. 4.3.2 Vitamin D3 deficiency has long-term effect on effector molecule usage and production Results from the vitamin D assay suggest a dysfunction of the enzymatic conversion between active and inactive vitamin D3. At all time points levels of vitamin D3 are highest for Def+VitD cells, with the most noticeable variations at 48, 72 h. Based on these results we postulate that the age of onset of vitamin D3 deficiency has long-term consequences on the function of vitamin D3 enzymes, with the relatively early onset of deficiency in our study resulting in an underutilization of exogenously supplemented vitamin D3. We found that the majority of our cytokines measured contained STAT1 component in their pathway (IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-5, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4). STAT1 is a known upregulator of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), which produces nitric oxide. For 0, 24 h we observed vitamin D3 supplemented cells (Def+VItD, Suf+VitD) producing similar levels of NO to their diet counterparts (Def+EtOH, Def+VItD). From 48 to 120 h we observed a very different response, vitamin D3 supplementation (Def+VItD) reduces NO production below that of alcohol exposed cells (Def+EtOH, Def+VItD). At several time points supplementation reduces NO production below that of Def/Suf diet cells. Results indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation impacts the production of NO in a temporal manner, reducing the production of NO over time. Alcohol exposure has a dysregulatory effect most notably increasing NO levels for Suf cells in comparison to Def cells, and is able to affect the production of NO earlier in Def cells. Correlations of IL-5's rate of change and IL-1β′s rate of change with that of other cytokines' were impacted by vitamin D3 sufficiency or deficiency, respectively. We found arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and type ll phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A), components of IL-5 and IL-1β pathways, are key in NADPH oxidase complex formation (NOX) (Fig. 7). ALOX5 is an enzyme that converts arachidonic acid into leukotrienes, which mediate an inflammatory response and leads to the formation of NOX [91,92]. PLA2G4A is an enzyme that catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid release and PLA2G4A are heavily dependent on calcium bioavailability and may relate to vitamin D3's classical function as an inducer of calcium absorption into the cell [93]."
17,"Coordination of cell proliferation, energy metabolism, and apoptosis","4.4 Coordination of cell proliferation, energy metabolism, and apoptosis Previous studies have linked vitamin D3 and PTPN11, AKT1, MAPK, and MAPK14 [94–97], which are components involved in the signaling mechanism of several of the cytokines vitamin D3 differentially modulates (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-5, IFN-γ, IL-2) (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. 7). MAPK1 and MAPK14 are linked closely with cell proliferation, while PTPN11 and AKT1 have been shown to modulate cell proliferation and mitochondrial metabolism, leading to oxidative stress [97–100]. This may indicate a possible mechanism for vitamin D3's modulation of oxidative stress and increased host cell survival. 4.4.1 Inhibition of apoptosis IL-5 exhibited notable rate of change correlations primarily in vitamin D3 sufficient diet. Differing from IL-5, both IL-1β and IL-6 primarily had rate of change correlations in deficient diet cells. However only IL-5 and IL-1β concentrations also correlated with cytotoxicity levels across both diets. We compared these cytokines due to their stratified rate of change correlations and found a number of components along the IL-5 and IL-1β signaling pathway that are heavily involved in the modulation of apoptosis, including BAX [101], CRKL [102], and various others (Fig. 7) [103–106]. The functional commonalities of these components suggest that modulation of apoptotic pathways in Suf diet cells is IL-5 dependent, while deficiency engenders a more IL-1β dependent modulation of apoptotic processes. Extracellular load was decreased by vitamin D3 supplementation in the case of both vitamin D3 deficient and sufficient diets, with loads below that of alcohol exposed cells at a majority of time intervals. Given that dysregulation of apoptosis can lead to higher extracellular bacteria, IL-5 associated modulation of apoptotic and cell proliferation pathways indicates a possible mechanism through which vitamin D3 sufficient diet cells are able to maintain significantly lower cell toxicity levels and, in comparison to deficient diet cells, comparable or slightly lower extracellular bacteria loads. 4.4.2 Activation of cell proliferation, energy metabolism Previous studies have linked vitamin D3 with PTPN11, AKT1, MAPK, and MAPK14 [94–97], all of which are components involved in the signaling mechanism of several of the cytokines vitamin D3 differentially modulates (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, IL-5, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6) (Fig. 7). MAPK1 and MAPK14 are linked closely with cell proliferation. PTPN11 and AKT1 have been shown to modulate cell proliferation and mitochondrial metabolism, leading to oxidative stress [97–100]. Differential modulation of cytokine signals transduced through these components hints at a possible mechanism by which vitamin D3 can temper oxidative stress and increase host cell survival."
18,Diet and condition-associated differentiating effects of cytokines impact the outcome of immune response to infection,"4.5 Diet and condition-associated differentiating effects of cytokines impact the outcome of immune response to infection While statistical analysis helped identify immune responses that were different or correlated as a result of the treatment (vitamin D3 diet, exogenous supplementation, or alcohol exposure), LMM analyses enabled us to investigate whether diet impacted the cytokines that emerged as significant in determining outcome of infection. Time had a significant positive effect on extracellular bacterial load and LDH across all three LMMs, implying that, controlling for all other predictors or factors, extracellular bacterial load and LDH levels increased over time, which is expected for this BCG infection level. Diet alone did not have a significant predictive effect in the combined LMM, but treatment had a significant effect on LDH (lower LDH relative to control treatment for ethanol and vitamin D3). However, diet had a significant effect on the relationship between TNF-α and intracellular or total bacterial load. Mirroring the diet associated skew observed for rate of change correlations, IL-1β had a negative effect on total bacterial load in the combined LMM and the vitamin D3 deficient LMM. Additionally, IL-1β had a negative effect on intra and extracellular load in the combined LMM. This suggests that IL-1β is a critical immune response variable in determining mycobacterium load particularly in vitamin D3 deficient individuals, which is consistent with IL-1β′s signaling pathway components that affect apoptosis, NOX and NO formation. The LMM analysis provided a flexible analytic approach for understanding the impact of cell condition and cytokines on infection outcomes. However, due to the relatively small sample size given the number of immune response variables that are potential predictors, the LMM had an increased risk of insufficient power and occurrence of type II errors. Additional replicates are needed to produce a more predictive model."
19,Conclusion,"Our study has examined the ramifications of vitamin D3 deficiency, in combination with supplementation and alcohol exposure during mycobacterium infection. By quantifying the effects of both in vivo diet and ex vivo vitamin D3 supplementation, we were able to investigate immunological connections that were minimally explored in other studies. Overall results demonstrate the benefit of in vivo sufficiency, and suggest that vitamin D3 is beneficial as a ‘rescue’ supplement in deficient host but not sufficient host, which in part is due to the vehicle utilized for ex vivo supplementation. As in our previous study, the efficacy of immune response during ex vivo infection was greatly diminished by deficiency and severely impaired by the addition of ethanol during infection. Cytokines significantly differed between conditions. More notably, production was primarily stratified by diet, with sufficient diet (Suf) and sufficient diet plus supplementation (Suf+VitD) differing from deficient diets (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH). Alcohol exposure (Suf+EtOH) continued to have a dysregulating effect and vary from other Suf conditions, with vitamin D3 deficient diet (Def, Def+VitD, Def+EtOH) and sufficient/alcohol exposed cells (Suf+EtOH) resulting in similar infection responses characterized by high amounts of host cell death and similar cytokine levels. Diet-associated correlation of cytokines and the relation to functional components within their signaling pathways provided a novel insight into the mechanistic impact of vitamin D3 deficiency and alcohol exposure on immune response to infection. The stratification of Suf associated IL-5 and Def associated IL-1β response indicates a clear difference in the immunological profile of the sufficient versus deficient host, with variations related to phagocytosis, NOX/NO effector production, apoptosis, and cell proliferation pathways. The lower number of Suf-associated significant correlations and LMM predictors, particularly pro-inflammatory predictors, is potentially indicative of the robustness of the vitamin D3 sufficient diet's immune response system, which appears resilient to infection-associated perturbations. Conversely, the increased correlations and predictors for the Def condition potentially reflect the concerted effort of the Def immune system to respond simultaneously to infection and diet or alcohol-related stress. These results provide a basis for further investigation of potential mechanisms driving the compounding effect of nutrition and alcoholism on infection related immune response."
