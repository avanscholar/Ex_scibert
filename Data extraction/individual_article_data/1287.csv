0,Introduction,"Biomass gasification in supercritical water is a promising alternative for hydrogen production for high water content feedstocks. The energy conversion efficiency of supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has been shown to be higher than thermal gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction and anaerobic digestion when the moisture content is above 31% [1]. SCWG has an obvious advantage for direct processing of wet biomass from agricultural and industrial residues or sewage sludge as no energy-consuming drying process is required to obtain high energy efficiency [2,3], while allowing production of hydrogen rich syngas and clean liquid effluent to be discharged [4]. Syngas (CO-H2) produced from SCWG can be used for direct feeding of next generation high efficiency internal combustion engines [5] while hydrogen, a rich energy source with zero carbon emissions, is of great interest for fuel cells. The SCWG process has recently received significant attention as a promising alternative for hydrogen generation [6–12], with a recent expert panel on biomass indicating the promise of SCWG, although noting the need for additional research before large scale investment [13]. Using glucose as a biomass model compound for SCWG, a number of simultaneous reactions have been reported, including [11,14]: (1) Gasification : C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → 3 CO + CO 2 + H 2 + 2 CH 4 (2) Water-gas shift : CO + H 2 O ⇆ CO 2 + H 2 (3) Methanation : CO + 3 H 2 ⇆ CH 4 + H 2 O (4) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ⇆ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O To maximize hydrogen production, the WGS reaction (2) needs to be enhanced while the methanation reactions (3 + 4) need to be decreased, which has been elusive. The WGS reaction is a moderately exothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction. SCWG at moderate temperatures (400–500 °C) generally produces methane rich gases [15], which is a current challenge. This research focused on enhancement of the WGSR and retardation of the methanation reactions at moderate temperatures (400–500 °C) using low cost bicomponent catalysts. Bicomponent catalysts have recently been found very effective for gasification in SCW with our group reporting almost 98% carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) in SCW using Ni-Ru on templated mesoporous alumina supports [16,17]. However, the use of noble metal Ru and template-based synthesis process might be non-attractive. Lu et al. [18] investigated Ni on various supports for SCWG of glucose. They reported that the hydrogen yield is affected by carbon removal efficiency from metallic surfaces by the catalyst support. The yield of hydrogen for different supports decreases in the order: CeO2/Al2O3 >La2O3/Al2O3 > MgO/Al2O3 >Al2O3 >ZrO2/Al2O3. Sánchez et al. [19] also found that La and Ce prevented coke formation on metallic surfaces. Moreover, La2O3 can also act as an adsorbent which selectively adsorbs carbon dioxide [20–22]; indicating that the forward WGS reaction (Eq. (2)) may be enhanced according to Le Chatelier’s principle. Furthermore, La2O3 is known to increase thermal stability [23] and can avoid metal agglomeration [24–26], which would be important in the aggressive SCW environment. Seri et al. examined the catalytic activity of La for cellulose degradation in water at ambient pressure and 250 °C [27]. However, none of the authors reported the role of La as a catalyst itself or it's role between the two competing reactions in SCWG: i.e. the water gas shift (WGS) and methanation reactions. In this work we hypothesized that Lanthanum (La) may act as promoter of the WGS reaction, similar to that of cerium (Ce) as Kim et al. [28] found when investigating the removal of CO. The chemical properties of La and Ce with respect to cation charge, ionic radii, and the stability of organic and inorganic complexes are very similar [29]. Hence, Ni, La and Ni-La impregnated on Al2O3 catalysts were investigated to investigate the role of La as catalyst and its influence on the WGS and methanation reactions to maximize hydrogen rich syngas production. In addition, a 18 wt% Ni/θ-Al2O3 catalyst was used as a reference catalyst for comparison, which favors CH4 rich syngas production [30]."
1,Experimental,"Glucose (reagent grade 99.98%), metallic precursors lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate [La(NO3)3·6H2O] and nickel nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Mississauga, Canada), and used as received. γ-Al2O3 pellets with 3 mm average particle diameter, 198 m2/g BET surface area and 0.42 cm3/g pore volume of were received from Aldrich (Mississauga, Canada). To prepare metallic solutions, de-ionized water was obtained from 18.2 MΩ-cm ultrapure system (EASY pure LF, model BDI-D7381, Mandel Scientific Co.)."
2,Catalyst synthesis,"2.1 Catalyst synthesis In a typical synthesis via the incipient wetness technique, as received γ-Al2O3 (198 m2/g) was transformed into θ-Al2O3 by calcining at 1050 °C to improve its high temperature properties [15,31]. Converting γ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3 also increases pore size [30] for better impregnation of active metals. Large pore size also helps facilitate penetrating bulky intermediate products to the catalyst active sites during SCWG. Metal precursors (Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O or La(NO3)3·6 H2O) were dissolved in the required amount of deionized water (130 vol% of total pore volume of θ-Al2O3). The metal salt solutions were then introduced to the θ-Al2O3 support with continuous mixing. The impregnated samples were then dried slowly (0.5 °C/min) to 60 °C followed by NH3-H2O vapor treatment to convert the metal salt anion to ammonium salt as described previously [30,31]. The treated sample was further dried by heating to 120 °C at a rate 1 °C/min and then to 250 °C at a rate 1.5 °C/min for one hour. Ammonium salts were removed through sublimation by this thermal treatment. Finally, catalysts were reduced at 600 °C (ramp rate: 5 °C/min and holding time: one hour) based on TPR analysis (Fig. S2) using hydrogen (5 vol% balanced with nitrogen). The actual loading of metal was measured from the weight difference between support alumina and the reduced catalysts."
3,Supercritical water gasification process,"2.2 Supercritical water gasification process The synthesized catalysts were evaluated using a 600 ml Hastelloy C-276 autoclave reactor (supplied by Autoclave Engineers, USA) with a 1.5 kW electric furnace for heating. The detailed description of the experimental set-up can be found elsewhere [30]. Lu et al. [18] used a similar 500 ml autoclave reactor while Sinag et al. [32] used a 1 L autoclave reactor for glucose gasification in supercritical water. In a typical experiment, the reactor was loaded with the required amount of catalyst and then closed. Then, 70 ml of deionized water was injected into the reactor followed by purging with He for 10 min. The reactor was then pressurized to 2.5 MPa with helium. The pressure was then raised to 24 MPa by heating the reactor to 400 °C which is above the critical point of water. The glucose solution (0.25 M) was then injected into the pressurized reactor using a syringe pump (Isco Model 100 DX, USA); providing a final reactor pressure of 28 MPa. The reaction time was calculated from the time of injection of the glucose feed into the reactor. After a pre-specified period of reaction, the product was cooled down to ambient temperature using a double pipe counter-current heat exchanger. The gaseous products were separated from the liquid effluent using a gas-liquid separator operating by sudden expansion (from 0.635 in. ID of stainless tube to 3 L volume vessel). Total gas flow was then measured by a mass flow meter (OMEGA, FMA 1700/1800, 0–2 L/min, Quebec, Canada) and collected in a Tedlar gas sampling bag for subsequent gas-chromatography (GC) analysis."
4,Product analysis and catalyst characterization,"2.3 Product analysis and catalyst characterization The product gases were analyzed by a gas-chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014, 120/80 D Hayesep stainless steel Nickel packed column, and dimensions of 6.2 m × 3.18 mm) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and helium as the carrier gas. Total carbon content in the liquid effluent that did not gasify was analyzed with a TOC-VCPH (Shimadzu Instruments) by sample oxidation in a catalyst-filled combustion tube heated to 680 °C. A non-dispersive infrared detector was used to detect the CO2 present in the carrier gas. The gas yield and carbon conversion to gas are defined as: (5) Yield = mol of gas produced mol of glucose in feed The carbon conversion to gas is defined by: (6) Carbon Conversion = 1 - mol of carbon in gas mol of carbon in feed The BET surface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume were determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010, with N2 used as the probe gas at 77 K. The samples were degassed at 250 °C for five hours before analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed utilizing a Rigaku diffractometer employing CuKα1 + Kα2 = 1.54184 Å radiation to estimate the change in crystallinities with time, which may have an effect on the reaction rate. The operating condition of the instrument was set at 45 kV and 160 mA with a scan rate of 10°/min and 2θ angle ranged from 2° to 82°. To collimate X-rays, 1° divergent and scatter slits, a 0.15 mm receiving slit were used. H2-pulse chemisorption measurements were conducted to calculate the active particle size, the percent dispersion and the active metal surface area using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920. Ar gas was passed through a bed of pre-reduced catalyst at a rate of 50 ml/min until the flow was stable. Then a series of hydrogen pulses (1.0 ml) were injected into the system at 40 °C. The gases leaving the system were analyzed by a TCD detector. The observed peaks from the TCD are due to hydrogen chemisorption on the active metal sites. As soon as two consecutive peaks showed the same area, the hydrogen pulse was discontinued. The percent metal dispersion was calculated according to: (7) % D = AX Wf where A is a constant, X is the total chemisorbed hydrogen, f is the fraction of reduced metal and W is the percentage of weight metal. The average crystal size (dv ) was calculated using the following equation: (8) d v = ϕ V m S m × 1 % D where φ is the particle shape constant, Vm is the volume of metal atoms, and Sm is the average surface area of metal surface exposed per surface metal atom. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images (Model JEOL 2010F) were obtained to examine the nanostructure morphology and the effect of SCW treatment on morphology. Prior to TEM analysis, the powdered samples were first dispersed in methanol by sonication and then placed on a copper grid covered with holey carbon film. The samples were then dried by normal evaporation for analysis. Non-gasified organic components were identified through GC-MS analysis. The organic compounds in the residual liquid were extracted through a liquid-liquid extraction method using dichloromethane and then analyzed by GC/MS (Varian 3400 GC-MS coupled with Finnigan MAT8400 ion-trap detector and a DB-5 capillary column; dimension: 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). Compounds were identified by matching the derived ion mass spectra to NIST or Wiley spectral libraries using HP chemstation software. The similarity indexes (SI) of the compounds reported were >75%."
5,Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis,"Thermodynamic analysis of glucose gasification in SCW was conducted for comparison between the theoretical equilibrium and the obtained experimental product composition. For the chemical equilibrium calculations, Gibbs free energy minimization was performed using the RGibbs module in Aspen Plus. A SCWG unit was simulated using a RGibbs module and a Flash Drum unit as shown in Fig. 1 . Withag et al. [33] compared various equation of state (EOS) methods for SCWG finding that the Peng-Robinson EOS with modified Huron-Vidal mixing rules (PR-MHV2) gave the highest accuracy. This method is known to be more accurate for processes involving a mixture of polar and non-polar molecules. Therefore, the Peng-Robinson property method with modified Huron-Vidal mixing rules (PR-MHV2) was used in this study. The built-in binary interaction parameters in Aspen Plus along with data from Poling et al. [34] was used for thermodynamic analysis. The binary interaction parameter between glucose and water was adopted from Abderafi and Bounahmidi [35].”"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of La and Ni on glucose gasification in SCW,"4.1 Effect of La and Ni on glucose gasification in SCW The first set of experiments investigated the role of individual Ni and La components on θ-Al2O3 supports during glucose decomposition using SCWG. Fig. 2 shows the yield of gaseous products (H2, CO, CH4, CO2) and carbon conversion obtained after 30 min of glucose gasification at 500 °C. The major gaseous products obtained from the SCWG of glucose are H2, CO, CO2, CH4, whereas the yields of C2-C4 hydrocarbons were found negligibly small. From Fig. 2, it is evident that the carbon conversion to gaseous products was increased from 62% (without catalyst) to above 85% with the use of catalyst. It also shows that non-catalytic SCWG yields higher CO and lower H2 values in comparison to the catalytic SCWG. Compared to the non-catalytic reaction, the use of the 18% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst increased the production of CH4, H2 and CO2, while decreasing CO. The reduction CO and increase of CH4 indicates the consumption of CO by the methanation reaction (Eq. (3)), since Ni is a well known methanation catalyst [36,37]. It is interesting to note that although CO production was reduced with the use of the 18% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the carbon conversion was significantly enhanced from 62 to 75%. This is attributed to enhanced CH4 and CO2 production, indicating that nickel is favorable for enhanced cracking of intermediate tar molecules. On the other hand, compared to the non-catalytic reaction, use of the 3.5 wt% La2O3 on Al2O3 without nickel led to an increase of H2 and CO2 production by approximately 1.7 and 1.8 mol respectively, at the expense of an equivalent amount of CO. Asha et al. [38] studied the molecular water adsorption characteristics on La2O3 and suggested a dissociative adsorption of water on La2O3. At high pressure they observed that in the presence of a strong reducing agent like CO, a facile redox cycle produces H2 and CO2 [38]. Therefore, it is rationalized that under supercritical water conditions where pressure is significantly high and CO is produced through thermal decomposition, the La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst facilitates the WGS reaction. When compared to Ni/θ-Al2O3, the La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst also reduced the CH4 production significantly. These results clearly indicate that La2O3 retards the methanation reactions (Eqs. (3) and (4) while favoring the WGS reaction. With a further increase in lanthanum oxide loading from 3.5 to 7 wt%, the H2 and CO2 production were slightly increased with a corresponding reduction of CO formation. La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst also was found to increase the carbon conversion from 62% to about 80% compared to non catalytic SCWG (Fig. 2). Using CeO2 as catalyst, Dejhosseini et al. [39] suggested that in SCW, cracking of heavy oil is promoted by redox reactions between oil and CeO2. Active oxygen generated from the SCW environment would then enhance the adsorption and desorption of oxygen via the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycle and cracking of -CC- bonds via oxidation [39]. Since, lanthanum and cerium have similar chemical properties, a similar redox model can be suggested for La2O3 (as described in more detail below) for the cracking of intermediate hydrocarbon products (tar) in the liquid stream. The role of La addition onto the Ni/θ-Al2O3 catalyst was also investigated. The 18 wt% Ni −3.5 wt% La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst yielded more than twice as much hydrogen as the 18 wt%Ni/θ-Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 2). This enhanced hydrogen yield is significantly higher than that reported previously for SCWG of glucose with or without a catalyst.[30,40,41] Compared to the 18 wt%Ni/θ-Al2O3, the 18 wt% Ni −3.5 wt% La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst also reduced CH4 formation by approximately 50 mol%, while giving lower CO and increased CO2. This result further indicates that the WGS reaction (Eq. (2)) was promoted by La addition, which is critical for higher H2 production. In addition, inhibition of the methanation reactions is indicated by the observed lower yields of methane and higher yield of CO2. The carbon conversion to gas reached almost 85% using Ni - La2O3/θ-Al2O3, making it a very attractive catalyst for SCWG. Cracking of oily materials can be promoted by an oxide catalyst through various redox reactions [42]. It is assumed that active oxygen species generated from the supercritical water enabled the enhanced absorption and release of oxygen via the La3+/La2+ redox cycle. The active oxygen species and lattice oxygen of Lanthanum oxide can thus react with the tar fraction to produce CO and CO2. The results from cracking (carbon gasification, Fig. 2) clearly indicated that oxygen compounds (CO and CO2) were generated by the oxidative cracking of tar. In our previous study, we reported the mechanism of carbon scavenging and production of CO using La2O3 [21]. Excess CO may also contribute to enhancing the water gas shift reaction to produce more hydrogen. The liquid analysis (Supplementary Information: Table S1) also showed that the La based catalysts significantly reduced organic materials in the liquid effluent. Table 1 shows the carbon balance closure in the range of 92–99% for the different catalysts synthesized and examined in this study. It also shows that the use of catalyst significantly enhanced the carbon gasification with only traces of solids and tar being observed (by TOC). The non-measured carbon may be due to the intermediate oily liquids entrapped in solid catalysts that could not be removed by simple drying. However, for single metal catalysts (Ni or La on alumina), the non-measured carbon is comparatively high. This may due to the formation of coke (solid char) inside the catalyst’s pores. Reduction of pore volume and coke formation are confirmed by BET and XRD analysis as described later in section 4.5."
8,Effect of catalysts on methanation and WGS reactions in SCW,"4.2 Effect of catalysts on methanation and WGS reactions in SCW To investigate further the effect of Ni and La loaded catalysts on the methanation and water gas shift reactions in SCW, the synthesized catalysts were examined with a specific gas mixture of CO/H2 which was fed into the reactor under SCW conditions (CO: H2:H2O was 1:3:6 (mol basis)). As described above, to maximize H2 production, the methanation reactions of CO (Eq. (3)) should be minimized whereas the WGS reaction (Eq. (2)) should be enhanced. Fig. 3 shows the relative percent of CO2 and CH4 production using this feed gas mixture for 30 min of reaction. It is apparent from Fig. 3 that CH4 production is favored by Ni while the La and La modified Ni catalysts drastically reduced CH4 formation from 32% to 1.2% and 0.5% respectively. The La doped catalyst also enhanced CO2 formation i.e. the WGS reaction (Eq. (2)). These results further indicate that doping with La significantly inhibits CH4 formation."
9,Parametric analysis,"4.3 Parametric analysis As described in the previous section, the maximum H2 production and carbon conversion to gas was achieved through use of a Ni-La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst. Therefore we chose this catalyst for a more detailed parametric study to help optimize the reaction conditions that maximize hydrogen production. The theoretical findings from Aspen Plus simulation (see Fig. S1) were compared with the experimental results as shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 also shows the effect of increasing the reactor residence time and temperature on the gas yields and carbon conversion to gas. From Fig. 4, it is evident that both hydrogen production and carbon gasification significantly increased with increasing residence time. Long residence times are required for gasification of intermediate products like furfural and phenols produced from glucose gasification in supercritical water at low temperatures [32]. For glucose gasification, Sinag et al. [32] used one hour residence time with Raney nickel and K2CO3 as catalysts while Ding et al. [43] and Lu et al. [18] used 30 min and 20 min residence time respectively. On the other hand, using a very low residence time, Williams et al. and Hologate et al. detected more than thirty components in the liquid product stream during supercritical water gasification of glucose [44,45]. H2 production reached almost thermodynamic equilibrium composition at 120 min at 500 °C. At 500 °C and 28 MPa, while the thermodynamic maximum of H2 yield is 4.15 mol /mol glucose feed, experimentally at this condition the H2 yield reached 3.65 mol/mol glucose feed after 30 min and 3.95 mol/mol glucose feed after 120 min reaction time (Fig. 4a). CO was found to increase in the first 10 min, then decrease (Fig. 4b). At the initial stages of the SCWG reaction (up to 10 min), production of CO dominates over the WGS and/or methanation reactions of CO. The observed lower CO yields and higher H2 and CO2 after 10 min reaction time (Fig. 4 a, b, d) is attributed to the WGS reaction dominating over the other reactions at later stages of SCWG. Fig. 4 also shows that both the CH4 production and the carbon gasification to gas increased with an increase of time and temperature. If methane is formed only by the methanation reaction, the reaction tendency of both carbon monoxide and hydrogen would decrease with time. On the other hand, a significant reduction of CO and almost equivalent amount of H2 increase with time confirms that CO is mainly consumed by the WGS reaction. It was previously reported that during SCWG of biomass, increased time and temperature enhances intermediate products (acids and aldehydes) decomposition to CH4 formation [46,47]. Therefore methane is mostly formed from the decomposition of glucose via intermediate products (Eq. (9)). (9) Glucose → water-soluble intermediate → gases When compared with the equilibrium composition, CH4 production is significantly low (Fig. 4c). This result indicates that the methanation reaction is significantly inhibited with the use of the La loaded catalyst. Therefore, it is rationalized that increased H2 and CO2 results from the WGS reaction while CH4 is formed by intermediates decomposition, which is confirmed by TOC analysis of the liquid stream. Fig. 5 shows the effect of feed concentration on the gaseous products and carbon conversion to gas using the Ni-La2O3/θ-Al2O3 catalyst. The carbon conversion was reduced with increased concentration, which is attributed to a lower gasification of organic compounds occurring. Production of hydrogen decreased by almost 60 mol% when the feed concentration was doubled from 0.25 M to 0.5 M. It is also observed that higher feed concentrations lowered the carbon dioxide yield, while only a slight increase of carbon monoxide and methane production was found. Similar results were found by Cherad et al. [48] and Kirsten et al. [49]. A thermodynamic analysis by Yan et al. [50] also showed a similar tendency. However, it should be noted that very low feed concentrations may require high pumping and effluent disposal costs. In this study, a moderate concentration of 0.25 M was investigated for catalyst performance evaluation."
10,GC-MS characterization of liquid products,"4.4 GC-MS characterization of liquid products The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) results of the residual liquid effluent were examined and are reported in the Supporting Information (Table S1). At 400 °C without catalyst, the main products were composed of phenols, furans, organic acids, alcohols, ketones, and some cyclo-compounds. With an increase in reaction temperature to 500 °C, most of the organic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones disappeared while phenols and arenes were detected in the residual liquids. The use of catalysts are known to break CH and CC bonds at 500 °C, with the organic products first decomposed to low molecular organic products then decomposed to H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 [30] . The intermediate compounds such as furfural, toluene, phenols etc. gasified in the presence of Ni/Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3 and Ni-La2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. Using the bicomponent Ni-La2O3/Al2O3 at 500 °C for 30 min, no significant organic compounds were detected. These results are consistent with liquid carbon conversion to gas shown in the previous sections."
11,Catalyst characterization,"4.5 Catalyst characterization The fresh and spent catalysts were examined by BET analysis to evaluate the effect of SCWG treatment on the surface area and pore volume (Fig. 6 ). The results show that the La catalyst gave the highest surface area and pore volume (Fig. 6). A higher active surface area is required to promote catalytic cracking and carbon conversion to gas. The loss of surface area and porosity in the spent catalysts could be due to sintering of the catalyst under SCW conditions [51]. The reduction of surface area and porosity of La2O3/Al2O3 in the spent catalysts are comparatively lower than Ni/Al2O3. Based on literature, one of the reasons for reduced porosity is deposition of coke on the catalyst pores [52]. However, by comparing the pore volumes of 3.5%La2O3/alumina and 7%La2O3/alumina, the reduction of pore volume in the spent catalyst is much higher using a lower amount of La loading. This finding can be explained as, loading of a higher concentration of La will block many of the pores of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 6) leaving limited available pore area. Secondly, based on literature, La scavenges the deposited carbon and adsorbs CO2, while releasing CO [20,21]. A comparatively lower reduction of porosity with higher La loading may be attributed to the higher scavenging of deposited carbon by La. Adsorption of CO2 and release of CO may also shift the equilibrium to product and promote the WGS reaction. Fig. 7 shows the pulse chemisorption results of the nickel based catalysts. No hydrogen chemisorption was noticed when La2O3 only catalysts were analyzed (Figs. S2 and S3). This confirms that hydrogen chemisorption occurred on the nickel sites even for the La2O3 doped nickel catalyst samples. It is observed that La2O3 helped to disperse the metallic crystallites and increased the surface area, which is consistent with the published literature [53]. From Fig. 7, it is apparent that for the spent catalysts, the active particle diameter increased while the metal dispersion decreased significantly. This result indicates that metal agglomeration occurred during SCWG. Under the SCW conditions, active metal surface area may also be decreased due to the dissolution or erosion of metal [54]. The supporting information shows the TEM analysis where the addition of La shows better metallic dispersion (Fig. S4); similar claims were reported by other researchers under non-supercritical conditions [24–26]. To examine the crystalline change of the catalyst during SCWG [21], powder XRD analysis of the fresh and used catalysts was conducted as shown in Fig. 8 . The phase transformation to NiO or NiAlO4 or La2NiO4 happened mainly in the first five minutes, after which no significant change was detected. The peaks at 52.26° and 61.30° are attributed to the metallic nickel. These peaks disappeared on the spent catalysts. On the spent catalyst, oxidized nickel (50.86°) and nickel aluminates (78.26°) appeared. A similar effect was also observed for the other crystallites. From these results we can rationalize that NiO, NiAlO4, La2NiO4 (after 5 min) remained catalytically active for tar cracking to produce gaseous products, as described in the previous section. It is also observed that coke deposition is insignificant on the La based catalysts. It was shown previously that the use of La inhibits coke deposition by carbon scavenging while some coke may be deposited on nickel metals [20,21]."
12,Conclusions,"1. The use of Ni/θ-Al2O3 catalyst produces methane rich gas, whereas modifying the same catalyst with La produces hydrogen rich gaseous products. Ni- La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst increases hydrogen production by threefold compared to non-catalytic SCWG and twofold compared to Ni-Al2O3 only catalyst. When the Ni-La/Al2O3 catalyst is used for SCWG, hydrogen production increased due to: Ni enhanced intermediate tar cracking, while La enhanced WGS reaction and retarded methanation reactions. 2. Lanthanum preferentially enhanced the water gas shift reaction over methanation reaction even in the presence of hydrogen and carbon oxides in supercritical water. 3. It was found that without using oxidant, almost 90% carbon conversion to gas is achievable using Ni- La2O3/Al2O3 catalyst at 500 °C in SCW. Temperature, concentration and residence time were found to have a large effect on carbon conversion to gas. It was also found that carbon conversion after 20 min is slower than the initial rate. For high quality liquid effluent from gasification, high temperature, low feed concentration and higher residence time were found favorable. 4. Thermodynamic equilibrium favors methane rich gaseous products at moderate temperatures with negligible amount of CO production. However, the experimental results show that CO consumption through WGS and/or methanation reactions require long reaction time to reach thermodynamic equilibrium composition. 5. La enhances metallic dispersion and thus contributed to enhanced activity. The change in crystallinity of active sites of the Ni-La2O3/Al2O3 was not affected significantly after an initial change period as measured by XRD. Nickel, nickel oxide and nickel aluminates during supercritical water gasification remained catalytically active sites for carbon gasification in supercritical water."
