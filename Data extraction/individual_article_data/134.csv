0,Introduction,"Demand for the development of renewable chemicals has been growing to cope with the depletion of fossil fuel reservoir and reduce the heavy dependence on petroleum-based chemicals, thus alleviating environmental issues. Among various sustainable technologies, the utilization of biomass is considered to be the most promising alternative to directly produce organic compounds containing basic elements of C, H, O. [1] For instance, a myriad of researches have unveiled strategies to produce valuable platform chemicals such as furfural, 5-HMF, and sugar alcohols from cellulose for decades [2]. Among sugar alcohols, sorbitol and mannitol are regarded as potential building block chemicals for the production of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isosorbide, or isomannide to be utilized for the production of commodity chemicals [3]. Heterogeneous catalysts exploiting various active metals and supports have been applied to yield C6 sugar alcohols selectively from cellulose. For instance, sorbitol has been successfully produced from cellulose via hydrogenation over Ru supported on MCM-48, activated carbon, and acid-functionalized silica [4–6]. Recently, algal biomass known as third generation biomass has received worldwide attention due to its attractive features over its terrestrial predecessors such as rapid growth, inedibility, and lignin-free structure. Alginic acid, a major constituent of marine biomass, is composed of two epimeric hexuronic acids (mannuronic acid and guluronic acid) linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bond as cellulose being composed of glucose. [7] Such structural analogy between alginic acid and cellulose has expedited the utilization of the former biopolymer using similar strategies in an attempt to produce value-added platform chemicals. For example, uronic acids, furfural, and lactic acid have been produced from macroalgae-derived alginic acid over sulfonated carbons, heteropoly acids, and metal oxides, respectively [8–10]. Furthermore, recent researches has reported that ruthenium supported on carbon and ruthenium-copper bimetallic catalysts can selectively produce C6 sugar alcohols from alginic acid [11,12]. However, it lacked recyclability during repeated reactions owing to leaching and aggregation of Ru or to carbon deposition on the catalyst under hydrothermal condition. The leaching of an active metal could be prevented to certain degree by modifying a catalyst. To date, several methods such as the addition of promoters, control of pretreatment or synthesis condition, and deposition of thin layer on active metals with metal oxides or carbon have been reported. [13,14] Aside from these strategies, introduction of nitrogen into carbon materials is also known to enhance the stability of catalysts. Defects created by N-doping could act as an anchoring site for metal species, thereby increasing the binding energy of metal nanoparticles to the carbon [15–18]. The resultant catalyst displays strong metal-support interaction, thus having unique catalytic activity and stability. With their superior properties, N-doped carbon catalysts have found their applications in various fields such as oxygen reduction reaction [19–22], hydrogen production via formic acid decomposition [23,24], (transfer) hydrogenation [25,26], and hydrogenolysis of biomass [27]. For instance, Pd and Ru nanoparticles stabilized by N-doped carbon support have been used for dehydrogenation of formic acid and CO2 hydrogenation, respectively. [28,29] Furthermore, it has been reported that even single atoms of Pt-group metals and Ni can be stabilized on N-doped carbons [30,31]. In the present paper, Ru supported on N-doped mesoporous carbon was applied in the hydrogenation of alginic acid to produce sorbitol and mannitol for the first time. The effect of N-doping on the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst was also examined."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Alginic acid was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, galactitol, arabitol, ribitol, xylitol, glycerol, and propylene glycol), sugars (glucose and mannose), and glucono-1,5-lactone were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Mannono-1,4-lactone was purchased from TCI Chemicals. These above standard samples were used without further purification for 3-point calibration curves of GC. Urea, colloidal silica (Ludox HS-40), and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrochloric acid was supplied from Samchun Chemical Co., Ltd."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation N-doped mesoporous carbons were synthesized using previously reported method with slight modifications as shown in Scheme S1. [32] Briefly, glucose and urea with varied ratios (urea/glucose = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) were mixed with a proper amount of distilled water which contained HCl with glucose/HCl ratio of 10(w/v). After complete dissolution, an appropriate amount of Ludox HS-40 was poured into the solution and magnetically stirred for 5 h at 80 °C until it became a brownish gel. The mixture was then dried in an oven for 15 h at 160 °C followed by crushing into powder. The resultant powder was carbonized in N2 stream for 2 h at 300 °C and for 2 h at desired temperatures. Finally, silica spheres in the carbon material were etched in 2 M of NaOH for 4 h at 85 °C to yield N-doped mesoporous carbon. These catalysts were denoted as Ru(5)/NMC(x)(y), where x and y represented the ratio of urea/glucose and the carbonization temperature, respectively. Ruthenium of 5 wt% was impregnated onto carbons using the conventional wet impregnation method. Before being used in the hydrogenation reaction, Ru(5)/NMC(x)(y) was reduced at 300 °C for 3 h under 10% H2 stream (100 ccm) followed by passivation under 5% O2 stream (100 ccm) at room temperature for 0.5 h. Ruthenium chloride on a N-doped mesoporous carbon was fully reduced below 300 °C (Fig. S4)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken with an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku). Voltage and current for X-ray generation with CuKα radiation were set at 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. Elemental analysis (EA) was conducted with an elemental analyzer (Thermo Fischer). Back titration was conducted according to a previously reported method to measure acid density of the catalysts using 0.01 M of NaOH and 0.02 M of HCl with a few drops of phenolphthalein solution. [8] Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer/Optima-4300 DV) was performed to measure the amount of ruthenium leached into the product solution after the reaction. N2 adsorption-desorption technique was applied to measure BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area, BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) pore volume, and BJH pore size distribution using BELSORP-mini II (BEL JAPAN Inc.). Prior to analysis, catalysts were degassed at 200 °C for at least 3 h. Dispersion and particle size of ruthenium were measured by CO chemisorption on BELCat (BEL JAPAN Inc.). Prior to CO pulse injection (4.98% CO/He, loop volume of 0.8570 cm3), catalysts were pretreated at 300 °C for 2 h under 5% H2 stream (50 ccm) and cooled down to 50 °C under He flow (50 ccm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate surface chemical states of ruthenium with an Al Kα μ-focused monochromatic source (1486.6 eV) in K-alpha (Thermo Scientific). C 1s peaks of all catalysts were calibrated to 284.5 eV. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and desorption (TPD) were conducted on a BEL-CAT BASIC (BEL JAPAN Inc.) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For H2-TPR, a sample was pretreated at 150 °C for 2 h under Ar (50 ccm). After cooling down to 40 °C, the sample was heated to 900 °C (10 °C/min) under 5% H2/Ar (50 ccm) and H2 consumption was detected by TCD. For H2-TPD, a sample was pre-reduced and H2 was adsorbed at 300 °C for 2 h under 5% H2/Ar (50 ccm). After cooling down to 40 °C under Ar flow (50 ccm), the amount of desorbed H2 was detected with TCD while the sample was heated to 900 °C (5 °C/min) under Ar flow (50 ccm)."
5,Catalytic reaction,"2.4 Catalytic reaction Catalytic hydrogenation of alginic acid was performed in a 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave (Parr Instrument Company). The vessel was charged with 0.1 g of 5 wt% Ru catalyst and 30 mL of distilled water containing 1% (w/v) of alginic acid. The reactor was purged with 50 bar of hydrogen three times to remove air. The autoclave was then pressurized with 50 bar of H2 followed by heating to 180 °C. After 1 h, the reactor was quickly quenched within 10 min in an ice-cold bath to prevent further reaction. The autoclave was stirred with an impeller at a speed of 1000 rpm during the whole ramping and reaction time. Recyclability of the catalyst was tested via a multi-batch procedure as reported previously. [8,11]"
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Liquid product was analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a DB-5 (60 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm) after being silylated using a method previously suggested to be able to lower high boiling points of sugar alcohols. [33] Carbon yield was determined as follows: Carbon yield (%) = 100 × (number of carbon atoms in an organic compounds/6) × (moles of an organic compound in the liquid product analyzed by GC/moles of a repeating unit in alginic acid). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out using Dionex Ultimate 3000 installed with a refractive index detector. Pullulan with a molecular weight range of 342∼80,500 was employed to calibrate the instrument. Total organic carbon (TOC) in the liquid product was analyzed using a Sievers 5310C (GE) equipped with an autosampler."
7,Results and discussion,"N-doped mesoporous carbons (NMC) with varied nitrogen amounts were synthesized via a hard-templating method as displayed in Scheme S1. The amount of nitrogen-doped was controlled by changing the amount of urea and carbonization temperature. To introduce a mesopore structure to carbon materials, colloidal silica with an average particle size of 12 nm was used. These prepared Ru-based carbon catalysts exhibited similar acid density measured by back titration. Results are summarized in Table S1. As shown in Fig. S1(a), when the ratio of urea/glucose was 0.1 and carbonization temperature was set to 700 °C, a uniform mesoporous structure was well developed with average pore diameter of ca. 8.2 nm displaying a type IV isotherm and H2 hysteresis loop. Fig. S1(b) displays the effect of carbonization temperature on the formation of mesoporous structure when the urea/glucose ratio was fixed at 0.1. All carbon materials showed a distinctive mesoporosity with average pore size of 7.2∼8.2 nm. As summarized in Table S2, all these carbons had high specific surface areas (>980 m2/g). Based on elemental analysis, the amount of nitrogen incorporated increased when the amount of urea was increased and the carbonization temperature was decreased. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S3, surface area and pore volume were decreased due to impregnation of ruthenium. CO chemisorption results showed that Ru nanoparticles were well dispersed on the support with an average particle size of around 4.5 nm. As displayed in Fig. 1 , all carbon materials showed two broad X-ray diffraction patterns at around 24° and 44° assigned to amorphous carbon. [34] The same XRD patterns were observed after nitrogen-doping and impregnation of Ru, indicating that the amorphous structure of carbons was unaffected by the introduction of nitrogen or deposition of Ru. The absence of diffraction patterns of Ru species after impregnation indicated that ruthenium was highly dispersed with average crystallite size below the detection limit of XRD which well corresponded to values obtained by CO chemisorption. XPS was conducted to investigate surface nitrogen species and electron states of Ru. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table S4, four nitrogen species were identified after the introduction of nitrogen into mesoporous carbons: pyridinic-N (398.1 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.7 eV), quaternary-N (400.6 eV), and pyridinic-N-O (403.2 eV). [35] The most notable feature was the increase in quaternary-N and pyridinic-N when the amount of urea was increased. It is known that when carbonization temperature is increased, the relative amount of quaternary-N is increased due to its better thermal stability than others [36]. Both quaternary-N and pyridinic-N could be involved in stabilizing metal particles according to a previous report [37]. It is understood that quaternary-N acting as an electron donator can delocalize and weaken π-π bonds of carbon atoms, resulting in preferential adsorption of Pt atoms on carbon atoms activated by neighbouring quaternary-N. In contrast, pyridinic-N can directly interact with the metal as an electron acceptor [38]. Electron-deficient Pt particles thus formed can interact more strongly with N-doped support via hybridization between d orbital of Pt and p orbital of pyridinic-N. In the present study, electron-deficient Ru species such as Ru3+ (464.6 eV) and Ru4+ (467.5 eV) were likely formed. [39] The relative amount of both Ru3+ and Ru4+ was increased when the N/C atomic ratio was increased. Specifically, the development of such oxidized Ru species corresponds better to the evolution of pyridinic-N than to that of quaternary-N. Therefore, it could be deduced that pyridinic-N is more likely to interact with Ru nanoparticles in our samples than quaternary-N. Formation of RuOx species could also be evidenced by H2-TPR. Three reduction peaks were observed as shown in Fig. 3 . A broad peak in the range of 500–600 °C could be attributed to methanation of carbon support catalyzed by ruthenium under hydrogen atmosphere. [40] The other two peaks could indicate the presence of reducible RuOx species. The first peak at ca. 140 °C could be assigned to the reduction of Ru3+ to Ru0 [41] while the second peak at ca. 230 °C could be ascribed to the reduction of Ru4+ to Ru0 [42,43]. As summarized in Table S5, hydrogen consumption arising from the reduction of RuOx was increased or decreased when nitrogen content in mesoporous carbons was increased or the carbonization temperature was elevated, respectively. This well corresponds to the trend of increase or decrease in relative amount of oxidized Ru species obtained by XPS. In addition, the calculated ratios of Ru3+ to Ru4+ obtained by H2-TPR and XPS are comparable each other. For example, the ratio of 2.2 (by H2-TPR) approximates the value of 2.1 (by XPS) for the case of Ru(5)/NMC(0.1)(700) as an example. The above result indicates that the incorporation of N favors the formation of RuOx withdrawing electrons from Ru, which further confirms certain interaction between dopant N and Ru. To produce sugar alcohols, batch-wise reactions were conducted over the above characterized catalysts (Fig. 4 ). Degrees of depolymerization of alginic acid over different catalysts were measured indirectly by means of GPC since the unconverted alginic acid could not be easily separated from the product mixture. [8,11] As displayed in Figure S3, the reactant was fully converted over all catalysts. In addition, TOC analysis results shown in Table S6 revealed that most carbons were retained in the liquid phase, suggesting that carbon loss into gas phase was negligible. Thus, losses in carbon balance could be attributed to unidentified byproducts. As shown in Fig. 4, hydrolytic hydrogenation of alginic acid mainly produced C6 sugar alcohols, sorbitol and mannitol. Unlike the case of cellulose hydrogenation, the catalytic reaction of alginic acid resulted in concurrent production of both sorbitol and mannitol since alginic acid consisted of two epimeric monomers. [11] The highest yield of target C6 sugar alcohols was obtained as 50.3% (sorbitol: 24.3% and mannitol: 26.0%) when Ru(5)/NMC(0.1)(600) was employed at 180 °C for 1 h. In addition to sorbitol and mannitol derived from these two monomers, the production of another C6 sugar alcohol, namely galactitol, was also observed. It has been reported that galactitol can be formed via epimerization of produced sugar alcohols during hydrogenation of cellulose or glucose, resulting in lower selectivity of desired sugar alcohols. [44] A general trend of decrease in galactitol formation was observed as the amount of N-doped was increased. Previous researches have suggested that epimerization of polyols can be catalyzed by metal sites in the presence of H2 [44,45]. As already discussed above, since all catalysts possessed nearly identical acid densities and average particle sizes, different activities might arise from the doped nitrogen or from the modified electronic state of Ru species on N-doped carbon. As already evidenced by H2-TPR and XPS, ruthenium deposited on N-doped carbons was featured by a deficit of electron density. Thus, it could be deduced that RuOx species on nitrogen-doped carbon are responsible for the suppression of epimerization. Another effect derived from N-doping is the inhibition of production of lower sugar alcohols. The formation of C4 and C5 sugar alcohols from sorbitol follows terminal C-C cleavage by decarbonylation or internal C-C cleavage by retro-aldol reaction. [46] The proposed mechanism of C-C scission involves a metallic site for dehydrogenation of sorbitol and hydrogenation of keto-intermediates [47,48]. Since the incorporation of N favors the formation of RuOx, it could be assumed that oxidized Ru species are again responsible for the inhibition of further hydrogenolysis of sorbitol and mannitol to lower polyols. Durability of a heterogeneous catalyst is a critical factor for practical application. Our previous report has revealed that leaching and sintering of ruthenium are the main reasons for the deactivation of commercial Ru/C catalyst during the hydrogenation of alginic acid. [11] Furthermore, deactivation was accelerated by the acidic nature of alginic acid in promoting the formation of a metal-carboxylate complex [11,49,50]. To investigate the effect of N-doping on the stability of catalysts, the recycle experiment was performed using catalysts with and without N-doping. As shown in Fig. 5 , when ruthenium supported on N-doped carbon was subjected to repeated reactions, no appreciable deactivation (less than 3%) was observed and the leaching of Ru was less than 1% as measured by ICP-AES even after the fourth reaction. On the other hand, without N-doping, Ru(5)/NMC(0)(700) lost its initial activity by more than 12% after the fourth reaction. In addition, Ru was leached out from Ru(5)/NMC(0)(700) twice as much as from N-doped carbon support, Ru(5)/NMC(0.2)(700). The strong interaction exerted between Ru and nitrogen-doped might have suppressed the formation of soluble Ru(OH)x species known to be responsible for the leaching of Ru. [51] The hydrothermal stability of the N-doped carbon catalyst was further investigated by CO chemisorption and N2 physisorption. Aggregation of the active metal on N-doped carbon was also negligible as evidenced by CO chemisorption (Table 1 ). Furthermore, no discernible decrease in specific surface area or pore volume of the catalyst was observed even after the fourth reaction, indicating no formation of coke. The interaction between transition metal and nitrogen-doped could be explained by the hybridization of d orbital of transition metal with π orbital of nitrogen which results in an intimate contact between metal and support. [18,52] Previous researches have reported beneficial effects of an intimate interfacial contact between ruthenium and carbon support on catalytic hydrogenation reactions [53]. Similarly, Arai et al. have reported the effect of interaction between Ru and supports on adsorption strength of hydrogen [54]. They found that hydrogen adsorption was enhanced by electron deficient ruthenium formed by electronegative supports. Experimentally, the intimate contact between metal and carbon support can be evidenced by H2-TPD. [55] As shown in Fig. 6 , H2-TPD results displayed two hydrogen desorption peaks. The first peak at around 120 °C could be assigned to the desorption from H2 chemisorbed on metal surface whereas the second peak at higher temperature, 300–400 °C, could be assigned to that from hydrogen chemisorbed on metal/support interface spilled-over from Ru to support. [56] The shift toward a lower desorption temperature of the second peak indicated that a stronger interaction was present when nitrogen content was increased. In addition, an increase in the desorption amount of hydrogen from metal/support interface was observed (Table S7). This clearly confirms the strong interaction between Ru and N-doped carbon support."
8,Conclusion,"To conclude, Ru supported on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons was applied to hydrolytic hydrogenation of alginic acid into sorbitol and mannitol. Introduction of nitrogen induced interaction of Ru with the support, especially with pyridinic-N resulting in evolution of RuOx species as evidence by XPS and H2-TPR. In addition, the intimate interaction between ruthenium and N-doped was also observed by H2-TPD. Oxidized Ru was found to suppress side reactions such as epimerization and C-C cleavage. The highest yield of target C6 sugar alcohols was 50.3% (sorbitol: 24.3% and mannitol: 26.0%) at 180 °C for 1 h over Ru(5)/NMC(0.1)(600). The catalyst exhibited excellent hydrothermal stability even after the fourth reaction. The strong interaction was proposed to be the reason for the inhibition of leaching and aggregation of Ru. This is the first attempt to use N-doped carbons for conversion of alginic acid to produce sugar alcohols. It would draw attention to the field of catalytic utilization of algal biomass."
