0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy carriers for the future. It is an energy-efficient, low-polluting fuel. When hydrogen is used in a fuel cell to generate electricity only water is produced and when combusted with air a small amount of NOx is additional produced [1,2]. The development of H2 fuel cells for vehicles, stationary and mobile applications has been an active area of research during the past 30 years [3]. Unfortunately, as mentioned by researchers and experts, the development of H2 economy seems far away because effective methods for the H2 production, as well as its storage and distribution, are still needed [4–6]. For example, the generation of H2 from suitable starting materials, such as water, at relatively low temperatures is critical [7]. Moreover, up to now, none of the alternative methods studied for H2 storage has reached sufficient maturity to be practical [8–10]. For example, hydrogen-containing vessels, whether they are high-pressure gas-containing cylinders or liquid containing vessels, have significant and lingering safety problems. Some new technologies, such as hydrogen storage on metals, graphitic adsorbents or carbon nano-tubes, are being explored but they are far away from practical applications [11]. There is an increasing demand to develop efficient and low cost methods for production of hydrogen as the current methods have drawbacks. For example, each of the current methods such as biological [12], water electrolysis [13] and chemical methods [14], have their own disadvantages such as low efficiency, high costs or based on fossil fuels which are neither recyclable nor clean [15,16]. Accordingly, metals and alloys are used to produce hydrogen because of their ability to corrode in solutions, such as water, alkaline and acidic. On-demand hydrogen release using metals can eliminate the need for hydrogen storage. Different metals and alloys have been used as anodic electrodes to help producing hydrogen. Carbon steel alloy produces hydrogen by immersion in acidic solution [17]. Different metals and alloys applied as cathodes for hydrogen evolution reactions, for example, ferrous alloys, nickel, and amorphous alloys [18–20]. In addition, the use aluminum (or aluminum alloys) for H2 generation from water has been evaluated. For example, the reactions of aluminum with aqueous solutions of NaOH have been previously studied. The feasibility of producing hydrogen for fuel cells applications from commercial aluminum and aluminum alloys and aqueous solutions with different bases (e.g. KOH, Ca(OH)2, NaOH and NaAlO2), also in sea water, has been studied. Their results showed that the corrosion of commercial aluminum and aluminum alloys in aqueous solutions could reduce hydrogen production costs for several applications, which currently use chemicals hydrides as raw materials to generate hydrogen in situ. In addition, preliminary experiments with KOH and NaOH showed a synergistic effect of base concentration and temperature to increase hydrogen production rate. It has been observed that carbon dioxide from air diminishes free hydroxide concentration in aqueous solutions, so that the working solution should not be in contact with air in order to maintain a good hydrogen production efficiency [21–23]. The results obtained for Al/Si and Al/Co alloys are potentially applicable in devices that can provide a source of CO2 free hydrogen at an adaptable rate to fuel cell requirements. Acid media, such as HCl, have been used for pickling, chemical and electrochemical etching of Al and its alloys. The cathodic reaction in acid media is considered as an enhancer for Al anodic reaction, where H ions attract the electrons released from the Al and H2 is consequently evolved. Also, three different electrodes, graphite, stainless steel and aluminum rods were used for hydrogen gas production from electrohydrolysis of wastewater organics using photovoltaic cells (PVC). The highest cumulative hydrogen gas formation was obtained with the aluminum electrode and the lowest was with the graphite electrode Hydrogen gas production from wastewater was 2.4 times higher than that produced from water when aluminum electrodes were used [24]. Waste anaerobic sludge was subjected to different DC voltages (0.5–5 V) for hydrogen gas production by using aluminum electrodes and a DC power supply [25]. The highest cumulative hydrogen production, daily hydrogen gas formation, hydrogen yield and percent hydrogen (94.3%) in the gas phase were obtained with 2 V DC voltage. Energy conversion efficiency (H2 energy/electrical energy) also reached the highest level (74%) with 2 V DC voltage application. Another study employed the reactive force field to examine the dynamics associated with the dissociation of adsorbed water molecules on an aluminum nanocluster surface [26]. The results shed light on this atomic scale behavior and increase the potential for reactive metal/water systems to be used as lightweight, portable, and on-demand energy sources via fast hydrogen gas production. In fact, there is a need to control the hydrogen evolution. The controlling of hydrogen evolution is an important process in the application of hydrogen energy. As stated previously, the need to suppress the parasitic corrosion while maintaining the electrochemical activity of the anode metal is one of the serious problems that affect the energy efficiency of Aluminum-air electrochemical generators with aqueous electrolytes (AlA ECG) [27]. It has been demonstrated that this problem may be solved in part either by using aluminum of higher purity or by employing aluminum-based anode materials with minor additions of indium, gallium, zinc, magnesium, tin, and thallium [28]. In the latter option, it is expedient to introduce alkali stannate-based additions into the electrolyte, as well as organic acids, ethyl alcohol, or glycerin [29–31]. The need to use high-purity aluminum or special aluminum-based alloys results in a significant increase in the cost of energy generated significantly narrows the range of possible applications of AlA ECG. In fact, using the aforementioned compounds to supress the parasitic corrosion of the AlA ECG is the process of inhibition and controlling the hydrogen evolution. Soler et al. [22] observed experimentally that the hydrogen production rate can be regulated by varying parameters such as the base concentration used, the temperature or the morphology and composition of the aluminum and aluminum alloy. This work investigates a simple process to produce hydrogen using aluminum alloy corrosion in hydrochloric acid solution. Rare earth inhibitors have been applied to control the hydrogen evolution process."
1,Experimental procedures,"Aluminum alloy was supplied by Non-Ferrous Alloy Company, Egypt. The alloy chemical composition is (wt. %) 2.2 Mg, 0.1 Mn, 0.1 Cu, 0.25 Si, Fe 0.4, Zn, 0.1–1015, and the remainder Al. The aluminum alloy sheets were polished with fine emery paper (800 grit). The sheets were precisely weighed before and after immersing in 250 ml of various solutions. The area of each sheet is 10 cm2. A 1 M HCl solution with different concentrations of the rare earth inhibitors, lanthanum (La) (as La(NO3)3.6H2O) and cerium (Ce) (as CeCL3·8H2O) were used in various experiments. Distilled water was used to prepare all the aqueous solutions. The compounds were supplied by BDH Chemicals Ltd. The La concentrations were 5 × 10−4 M, 14 × 10−4 M and 23 × 10−4 M; and the Ce concentrations were 5 × 10−5 M, 13 × 10−5 M, and 26 × 10−5 M. Both the La and Ce inhibitor were also combined together to study their synergistic effect. These combinations are C1, C2 and C3, where C1 is 5 × 10−5 M Ce+ 14 × 10−4 M La, C2 is 5 × 10−5 M Ce + 23 × 10−4 M La), and C3 is 13 × 10−5 M Ce+ 23 × 10−4 M La. The experiments were run at room temperature (RT) and 40 °C. The different solutions tested in this study were freshly prepared before performing the hydrogen production experiments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on the AA surface before and after immersion to investigate the crystal structure of the alloy. The XRD patterns were recorded on a Siemens-d5000 diffract meter using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Scanning Electron Microscopy with Secondary Electron Detector (SEM-SED) was performed on an XL30 ESEM in the Hi-Vac mode; the acceleration voltage was 15 kV."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production Aluminum alloy (AA) corrosion in 1M HCl as a function of time at RT, 40 °C and 50 °C are plotted in Fig. 1 . While the hydrogen amounts (HA) as a function of time at the same temperatures are plotted in Fig. 2 . The HA produced is calculated using equation (1) [17]. (1) M = ( HA x m ) / n Where M is the corroded mass of AA, HA is the hydrogen amount, m is the atomic mass of metal and n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction. The HA increases with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 2. As discussed by Zhuk et al., the temperature increase is further accompanied by an increase in the electrochemical activity, i.e. enhanced anodic reactivity of aluminum, and by an increase of the hydrogen yield [32]. On the other hand, the aluminum–water reaction is exothermic which helps the reaction proceed spontaneously, because of the exothermic behavior, the water temperature increases [33]. Also, release of hydrogen in the interface of aluminum and aluminum hydroxide gel increases porosity, letting water penetrate deep inside the aluminum particle and react with innermost atoms. Therefore, presence of an aqueous solution of 1M HCl will increase the corrosion of the AA with increasing temperatures, Fig. 1. Consequently, the rate of hydrogen evolution will increase. This observation might be attributed also to a rapidly formed surface oxide film at lower temperature, but at high temperature this oxide film will be unstable [6,34]. As stated, the dissolution rate of aluminum increased in presence of HCl, especially, with increasing the HCl concentration. In addition, temperature increases the dissolution rate of aluminum. The deleterious effects of acid with increasing temperature attributed to activating the hydrogen evolution (cathodic reaction (1)), which has faster kinetics than oxygen reduction and enhancing the Al-dissolution (anodic reaction (2)) [29,35]. (2) 6 H + + 6 e → 3 H 2 ↑ (3) 2 Al → 2 Al 3 + + 6 e Additionally, acid could activate (via film breakdown) the originally passive alloy surface as in the case of iron surface [30,36]. The passive film breakdown is of great concern and various mechanisms have been suggested to explain its breakdown [37]. As proposed, the migration of chloride ions through the film leads to breakdown, where the ions reach the metal–film interface. The chloride ions do not enter the oxide film but it chemisorbed onto the oxide surface and acted as a reaction partner, aiding dissolution via the formation of oxide–chloride complexes [38]."
4,Controlling hydrogen production rates,"3.2 Controlling hydrogen production rates The hydrogen amount (HA) is not significantly affected by the concentrations of Ce inhibitor. This is shown in Fig. 3 where the production hydrogen as a function time is presented for the above mentioned concentrations of Ce. This means that the Ce is a non-effective inhibitor to control hydrogen evolution. The rate of hydrogen evolution in presence of Ce is nearly equal the rate of the base solution. The minimum rate of the HA produced was attained in the presence of 13 × 10−5 M of Ce and the HA production was accelerated in presence of 5 × 10−5 M and 26 × 10−5 M of Ce. It can be argued that there is an inverse action, which means that the active anodic site on the AA surface is not inhibited (reaction 3). There is no adsorption of the inhibitor on such sites. As shown in Fig. 4 , the rare earth inhibitor (La) concentrations, 5 × 10−4 M, 14 × 10−4 M, and 23 × 10−4 M, lead to a significant decrease in HA at RT. The maximum decrease of the HA was obtained in presence of 14 × 10−4 M, and 23 × 10−4 M of the La. It is of particular interest to notice that in the first hour of immersion the HA is reduced by ∼75% in presence of 23 × 10−4 M, but after 5 h of immersion, the HA was reduced only by 33% with respect to the HA in case of 1 M HCl at such time (compare Figs. 2 and 4. The 5 × 10−4 M of La accelerates the hydrogen evolution (i.e. increasing HA), especially with increasing the immersion period. In case of decreasing the HA, the rare earth inhibitors may play a role in increasing oxide film passivation. As mentioned, Ce ions can be incorporated in the passive oxide film on metal surface to form a protective conversion coating and a more resistant oxide film on the surface may be achieved [39–41]. Accordingly, the La ions can be incorporated in the passive oxide film on metal surface to form a protective conversion coating and a more resistant oxide film. This behavior may rationalize its high inhibitory action. If the immersion extends to 5 h, the oxide film will be unstable. The acceleration of hydrogen evolution could be rationalized on the bases that the presence of aggressive aqueous solution of HCl could increase the aluminum dissolution (anodic reaction (3)). In case of Ce (as CeCl3), the increasing of its concentration will lead to increase the chloride ions in solution, which may accelerate the corrosion process when the concentration is increased to 26 × 10−5 M. The rate of HA varied with different concentrations of the inhibitors, as in Table 1 . The Ce concentrations, 5 × 10−5 M and 26 × 10−5 M, accelerate the rate of hydrogen evolution. The La concentrations, 14 × 10−4 M and 23 × 10−4 M, control the rate of hydrogen evolution."
5,Synergism effect on controlling HA,"3.3 Synergism effect on controlling HA The synergism effect of Ce and La combination with 1M of HCl solution on the HA was tested at RT and 40 °C. Different concentrations are combined together, C1, C2 and C3, as defined. These concentrations had chosen because of their significant effect on the inhibition of AA corrosion. As observed in Fig. 5 , the C3 shows maximum decrease of HA at RT. This suggests that a synergistic effect exists between the Ce and La. The synergism enhances the passivation of the oxide film [42]. Raising the temperature to 40 °C accelerates hydrogen evolution process, as shown in Fig. 6 . The increase of temperature de-stabilized the aluminum oxide interaction [43]. The de-stabilization may arise because of the Cl− penetration into the oxide lattice, followed by substitution for O2−. The substitution creates aluminum ion vacancies in the cation lattice, which reduces the film resistance and increases the rate of hydrogen evolution. Supplying heat by increasing the temperature could enhance this substitution. It is stated that aluminum has a greater chemical reactivity at moderate temperatures and it combines with most of non-metallic elements [44]. The hydrogen evolution rate was dramatically deceased in presence of mixture C3 at RT, as shown in Table 1. The percentage of hydrogen amount controlling is 93%, as represented in Table 2 . The rate increased with increasing temperature to 40 °C, as observed in Fig. 6. It proposed that the increase of temperature would de-stabilize the oxide film and activated the dissolution reaction [34,36]. The presence of both inhibitors (La and Ce) might enhance the oxide film passivaion on the AA surface [32]. Mora et al. discussed that the XPS results performed on the cerium-passivated tinplate show oxide (Ce–O) and hydroxide (Ce–OH) groups as the major components of the cerium-rich coating [36]. Based on this discussion the presence of both elements (Ce and La) together may form oxides (La–O) and (Ce–O), and hydroxides (La–OH) and (Ce–OH) groups as a major components of the surface coating. Therefore, the film of both elements (Ce and La) is a mixture of La(III) (La (OH)3), Ce(III)(Ce(OH)3), La(IV) (La–O2–La(OH)4) and Ce(IV) (Ce–O2–Ce(OH)4) [37]. Additionally, the presence of water could reduce the mobility of the proton and thereby decrease the corrosion rates when active corrosion occurs, as has been shown for iron [35]."
6,X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SEM measurements,"3.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SEM measurements Figs. (7–9) show the XRD patterns of the aluminum alloy (AA) in 1 M HCl and in presence of La, Ce and C3. These patterns exhibit features characteristic of the AA crystallographic phase. It is observed that the AA structure is well crystalline, which is important in explaining its high corrosion resistance. In fact, all true solids are crystalline in nature [45]. Al crystal structure indexed on the cubic unit cell. This fact largely accounts for their rigidity, since the close packing of atoms in a geometrical pattern, makes it more difficult to distort the structure. This is because an atom in the solid state attains its lowest thermodynamic energy only when it occupies a site within a perfect crystal lattice [46]. Under specific conditions, such as increasing temperature and subject to an aggressive environment such as an acidic one, the thermodynamic energy of the atom or group of atoms may be changed. Accordingly, the metal or alloy will be liable to corrosion attack (reaction (2)), which leads to increase the hydrogen evolution (reaction (1)). In presence of the inhibitors concentrations, which remote the hydrogen evolution, especially 23x10−4 M La and C3, the intensities of hkl phases are not greatly changed [42]. In case of Ce, the XRD shows that there is a notable change in the hkl phases’ intensities of AA, which means that the phases corrodes with different extent, as shown in Fig. 9. It could be assumed that the Al (220) phase has a lower corrosion resistance than that of the (311) phase, especially, with prolonging the immersion at high temperature. It was discussed that surface atomic density between iron (100) phase and (110) phase surfaces might play a role in hardness variation of the hkl phases [30,31]. Therefore, their corrosion will occur with different extents. The intensities’ orders of Al crystal phases changed when the sample subjected to concentrations, which reduce the corrosion of Al [42]. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image of the AA before immersion in solutions shows a non-uniform surface with semi-cracks, as shown in Fig. 10 . As stated, metals are rarely uniform in composition or structure whether we consider them from a macroscopic or a microscopic viewpoint [46]. Subjecting the alloy to test solutions, especially those which increase the hydrogen evolution, increases the surface roughness and voids. As in Fig. 11 , the SEM image shows high surface roughness and imperfections, which is indicative of intergranular corrosion attack [30]. In fact, the imperfections of Al alloy will increase the anodic sites, which increase the cathodic reactions (i.e. hydrogen production increases). Prolonging the immersion to 5 h increases surface roughness due to formation of porous oxide film of Al2O3. This film instantly decreases the corrosion penetration without complete stopping of Cl− ions to penetrate and to increase the oxidation reaction, accordingly, oxide film breakdown occurs [41,47]. In addition, the surface roughness and imperfectness may increase the hydrogen evolution process. As stated, the increased surface roughness was beneficial to the improvement of the electrode activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction [18]."
7,Conclusion and economic impact of AA on H2 production,"Rare earth inhibitors (La and Ce) have been applied to control hydrogen evolution of AA in 1M HCl. The rate of hydrogen evolution in absence of inhibitors increased with increasing temperature. This work represents some new findings, such as hydrogen evolution could be controlled by specific concentrations of the La inhibitor and the hydrogen evolution rate was dramatically deceased in presence of mixture C3 (La + Ce) at RT. This means that a synergistic effect exists between La and Ce. Presence of inhibitors together, La and Ce, might enhance oxide film passivation on the AA surface at RT. Increasing temperature might decrease the oxide film stability of the AA surface, therefore, the hydrogen evolution was increased both in presence and in absence the inhibitors. Also, the Ce is a non-effective inhibitor to control hydrogen evolution. XRD patterns show that AA has a well crystalline structure. There was a variation in the hkl phases’ intensities. This observation might attribute to difference in surface atomic densities of the phases. In fact, commercial aluminum alloy (AA) as a source for hydrogen has an economic effect on the cost of energy [32]. The importance of aluminum as a source for hydrogen was represented by Alumi Fuel Power, Inc. [48]. It is a reactor unit of using Al to produce hydrogen and generating energy by reaction with water. They proposed the following equation: Al + Water + Secret Sauce = Low-Cost Hydrogen Fuel. Estimation is made of the fuel factor (FF) of the cost of energy for the AA. The fuel component is defined as the ration of the cost of fuel (AA) to the amount of energy produced from this fuel. In accordance with known data, the proposed hydrogen production cost is in the range $ 4–30 kg−1, if it produces from natural gas (NG), but production from AA decreases the cost to $ 10 kg−1. This estimation was in 2004. The November 2007 commodity price for aluminum is $2.36 per kg [49]. At this price, hydrogen from an aluminum-water hydrogen generation approach would cost approximately $21 per kg H2. The average price of 1 kg of Al is $ 2.43 in December 2010. An estimation of the hydrogen production from Al is about $8.1/kgH2 [50]. It is important to control the production of hydrogen by using compounds (inhibitors), which remote the corrosion of the AA. Apparently, using these compounds may increase the cost of the hydrogen, but in reality, there is no increase in the cost because this will be neutralized by lengthening the time of applications, on-board and stationary. Finally, The new findings of the paper are: 1-Hydrogen evolution process can be controlled by using inhibitors, which control the corrosion of materials, 2-Application of inhibitors to control hydrogen is new trend and the literature is rare, and 3-Al alloy is important source for hydrogen production in acidic solution."
