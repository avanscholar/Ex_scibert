0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean, renewable and efficient energy source, which has been deemed as a potential energy carrier of the future to substitute fossil fuel [1,2]. Traditionally, hydrogen is mainly produced by hydrocarbon reformation and electrolysis of water, which are energy-intensive, unfriendly to environment, and still dependent on fossil fuel. From the aspect of energy security and environmental protection, bio-H2 production has been an exciting area of bio-energy production. [3,4]. In the last two decades, extensive scientific attention have been conduced toward microorganism generating hydrogen by mixed culture from pure carbohydrates such as sucrose and glucose, as well as organic wastewater from molasses, starch and food processing. Among them, several species of microorganisms such as the photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae or fermentative bacteria are commonly utilized for biological hydrogen production [2,4–10]. Furthermore, facultative aerobes and strict anaerobes, such as Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter, are recognized as effective hydrogen producers. In other words, it is of great significance to reveal the mechanism of hydrogen production and improve hydrogen production performance of a mixed-culture system. For example, James D and Tanisho S reported that hydrogen production rate of Clostridium pasteurianum and Enterobacter aerogenes E. 82005 was 1.2 mmol/g h and 17 mmol/g h, respectively [6,11 ], Collet C et al found that hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate of C. thermolacticum fell into 1.5 mol H2/mol lactose and 2:58 H2/ mmol l h, respectively [12], also hydrogen production rate of Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT08 (29.63 mmol/g h)was reported by Kumar N [7], the hydrogen production yield of Enterobacter aerogenes fell into 1.05–2.2 mol H2/mol glucose. However, the information regarding hydrogen-producing characteristics of pure bacterial strains is surprisingly lacking so far. For the above reasons, in the present work we isolated a new hydrogen-producing bacterial strain F.P 01 from an anaerobic bioreactor. Several important parameters of strain F.P 01 including physiological and biochemical characteristics, fermentative conditions of bio-hydrogen production were investigated to identify the proper conditions for hydrogen production with the pure isolate in batch cultivations."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sample source,2.1 Sample source The bacterial samples were collected from anaerobic sludge in an anaerobic fermentor fed with molasses with a working volume of 5 L. Cow dung as the fermentation seed was obtained from Zhengzhou suburbs which was watering and aerated for 2–24 h before used.
3,Culture medium,"2.2 Culture medium The basal medium used for isolation and cultivation of hydrogen-producing strains consisting of 10 g/L glucose, 3 g/L peptone, 1 g/L yeast extract, 1 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L K2HPO4, 0.5 g/L l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g/L MgCl2. The pH of the medium was adjusted initially to 6.5. The basal fermentation medium was prepared as follows: 10 g glucose, 3 g peptone, 1 g yeast extract, 0.5 g l-cysteine·HCl·H2O, 0.1 g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g MgCl2, 10 mL mineral salt solution (contained 0.01 g/L MnSO4·7H2O, 0.05 g/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g/L H3BO3, 0.01 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, 0.01 g/L Na2MoO4, 0.2 g/L CoCl2·6H2O, 0.01 g/L AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.001 g/L NICl·6H2O) and 5 mL vitamin solution (contained 0.01 g/L cobalamin, 0.025 g/L Vitamin C, 0.025 g/L riboflavin, 0.02 g/L citric acid, 0.05 g/L pyridoxal, 0.01 g/L folic acid, 0.025 g/L creatine) were dissolved in 1 L of KH2PO4–Na2HPO4 buffer (final concentration 0.20 M, pH 6.47)."
4,Isolation of hydrogen-producing strains,"2.3 Isolation of hydrogen-producing strains The sluge sample was diluted 10 times with sterile distilled water, spread onto agar plates, and then incubated at 36 °C for 3–7 days under anaerobic condition. Single colonies obtained on agar plates were re-streaked more than three times to ensure the purity of the strains, and then transferred into a serum bottle containing the basal media. Hydrogen-producing bacteria were selected based on the existence of hydrogen in the evolved gas, and the colony with highest hydrogen producing activity was selected for further analysis. The strains were stored at −18 °C in sterile 20% (v/v) glycerol solution with an anaerobic environment."
5,Hydrogen production in the batch culture,"2.4 Hydrogen production in the batch culture The hydrogen production capacity of every single strain was tested in serum bottles. The bottles of 140 mL (working volume, 50 mL) had been flushed with nitrogen gas, capped with rubber stopper and then sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min. The cultivations were performed at 36 ± 1 °C in a gyratory incubator with a shaking speed of 120 rpm containing the basal media, and the hydrogen-producing bacteria were selected based on the existence of hydrogen in the evolved gas from the serum bottles. At each time interval, the total gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using water-replace equipment until no gas was produced, and the concentration of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane in the gas production, and the volatile fatty acids and alcohol in fermented liquors were detected by gas chromatography. All the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates. The standard deviation in results was within 5%."
6,Analytical methods and instruments,"2.5 Analytical methods and instruments Hydrogen concentration was measured by a Gas Chromatograph (GC, Agilent 4890D) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 6 feet stainless column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh). The operational temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were 100 °C, 80 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min, and the sample size was 0.4 mL. The concentrations of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and the alcohol were analyzed using another GC of the same model (GC, Agilent 4980) with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 8 feet stainless column packed with 10% PEG-20 M and 2% H3PO4 (80/100 mesh). The temperature of the injection port, the detector and the oven were 220 °C, 240 °C and a programmed column of 130–175 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min, and the sample size was 1 μL; PH value was determined by a Microcomputer pH Meter-6071; The fermentation tests were carried out in an Air Bath Temperature Shaker THZ-82B; Morphological examinations were performed with a light microscope CH-30 (Olympus, Japan) and an electron microscope AMRAY-1000B (Amray Surg Equip Ltd, USA); The microbiological work was performed in an Anaerobic Glove Box (Shanghai Yuejin Medical Instruments Factory, China) under a gas mixture containing 85% N2, 10% H2 and 5% CO2. Physiological and biochemical tests were carried out according tostandard methods [13]. The growth curve of bacteria was drawed based on the method of dry weight of cells, which was determined by centrifuging the culture broths (3000 g, 10 min), washing twice with distilled water and then filtering the broth with 0.45 mm membrane filters. The filters were dried in an oven at 105 °C, until no weight changes between consecutive measurements were observed. Hydrogen gas production was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval using the mass balance equation: (1) V = V 0 γ i + ∑ V i γ i Equation (1) should be, Where was the final fraction of hydrogen in the headspace. Here, V is the cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i); V 0 is the volume of headspace of vials; V i is the biogas volume discharged from the vials at the time interval (i) and γ i is the fraction of hydrogen gas discharged from the vials at the time interval (i)."
7,Kinetic modeling,"2.6 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of hydrogen produced in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (2) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative hydrogen production (mL); λ the lag time (h), P the hydrogen production potential (mL), Rm the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h), e the 2.718281828. In this study, Rm is expressed as mL of H2/g-substrate h−1, the specific hydrogen production potential (Ps ) is defined as ml H2/g-substrate."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Isolation and identification of strain F.P 01,"3.1 Isolation and identification of strain F.P 01 The samples were collected from hydrogen-producing reactor in different status. In accordance with the principle to select the rapidly growth and predominant colonies under the same conditions, 15 hydrogen-producing strains were isolated. Then after further screening of hydrogen production capacity, 3 strains represented better. Among which, the strain F.P 01 having an ability for hydrogen production was obtained except other two bacterial strain Fanp2 and Fanp3 as reported by Pan et al. [14]. The strain F.P 01 was a mesophilic and facultative anaerobic bacterium, which exhibited gram-negative staining in both the exponential and stationary growth phases, and a regular long rod-shaped bacteria with the size of 0.6–0.9 μm × 1.2–2.5 μm observed under the microscope (Fig. 1 ). Other physiological characteristics of F.P 01 were summarized as follows: Colony of F.P 01 was primrose yellow, smoothness, bulges and with regular edge, but didn't produce spores when the environment becomes stressed. The isolate could produce hydrogen from different organic substrates such as maltose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, galactose, cellobiose, xylose and dextrin, but didn't ferment arabitol and tartaric acid. It had a good growth at pH of 5.5–6.0 and growth temperature of 30 °C in an ordinary culture medium. According to bacteria morphology and Berger's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, combination of physiological and biochemical characteristics of the isolated strain, F.P 01 was preliminary considered as the facultative anaerobic strain belonging to E. cloacae. However, the desired result may be necessary to further verify by means of the identification of 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis in the next research."
10,The growth curve of F.P 01,"3.2 The growth curve of F.P 01 To better understand the hydrogen production characteristics of F.P 01, the maltose was employed as the carbon source in the batch tests. Several key environmental factors of effecting hydrogen fermentation were further investigated. Fig. 2 showed the time course of the batch culture of F.P 01 in the basal medium of Section 2.2 at initial pH 6.5 and 36 °C. Dry weight of cells indicated the quantity of bacteria, and their changes over time demonstrated the growth of bacteria. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that after a lag phase of about 2 h, F.P 01 was entering its logarithmic growth phase, in which the bacteria showed a rapid linear-type growth and the most hydrogen production activity during 2–10 h. After 10 h, with the consumption of nutrients and accumulation of toxic metabolite, bacterial growth was inhibited and came into decline phase. A negative growth showed up that a large number of cells dead, while hydrogen production of F.P 01 stopped gradually."
11,Effect of maltose concentration,"3.3 Effect of maltose concentration To examine the effect of the substrate concentration on the hydrogen generation by strain F.P 01, the batch experiments were performed by changing the initial maltose concentration from 5 to 20 g/L in the basal fermentation medium. Fig. 3 depicts the time courses of hydrogen production potential and the hydrogen percentage with change of maltose concentration. As can be seen from Fig. 3, after the inoculation, hydrogen production occurred at each maltose concentration, and the hydrogen production potential increased with increasing maltose concentration and reached the maximum value 182 mL/g-maltose at the maltose concentration of 10 g/L. Afterward, the hydrogen production potential significantly decreased. Even at a maltose concentration of 20 g/L, the hydrogen production potential could also be observed. The percentages of hydrogen in the biogas were between 58 and 73% and the maximum hydrogen percentage appeared at the maltose concentration of 10 g/L. No methane was detected during the process based on GC–TCD analysis. The results indicated that the substrate concentration significantly effected hydrogen production. But the hydrogen production should be inhibited under a higher concentration of substrate due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids."
12,Effect of pH,"3.4 Effect of pH The pH level in the bioreactor was also a vital factor for maximum hydrogen production. because it considerably affected the hydrogen productivity, and also may directly affect the hydrogenase activity and/or the metabolism pathway of producing hydrogen bacteria, as well as microbial communities [14]. Fig. 4 showed effects of medium pH on the cumulative hydrogen and hydrogen production rate with F.P 01 at the maltose concentration of 10 g/L. As shown in Fig. 4, the pH level significantly affected the hydrogen production potential and hydrogen production rate in the batch tests, the hydrogen production potential increased remarkably with the increase of pH in the range of pH 4.0–5.0, the maximum hydrogen yield of 180 mL/g maltose and hydrogen production rate of 4.0 mL/h occurred at operating pH 5.0, and then the hydrogen production potential decreased sharply with further increase of medium pH in the range of 5.0–8.0. A similar trends was also found in the range of pH 5.0–7.0, and then the hydrogen production rate tended invariant in the range of 7.0–8.0. Hydrogen production stopped while the medium pH in the reactor was less than 4.0 or high than 8.0. The result was consistent with one of literature as reported by Fan and Fang et al. [15,16]. The results suggested that favorable pH control could stimulate F.P 01 producing hydrogen andsuppressed the hydrogen-consuming activity of the anaerobic microflora [17]. So far in the literature the characteristics of hydrogen production by some strains were also reported, e.g., Rachman M.A. et al. obtained less than 1 mol H2/mol- glucose from E. aerogenes HU-101. [18]. Mishra et al. reported a high hydrogen yield of 3.12 mol/mol-glucose than the wild strain by Escherichia coli [19]. Due to there existed the drastic differences among reactor, feedstock, and fermentation conditions, so it was difficult to compare hydrogen production potential and hydrogen production rate among the different strains reported. Nevertheless, we could conclude that the producing hydrogen characteristics with the strain F.P 01 were generally similar to most other hydrogen-producing strains."
13,Characteristics of hydrogen fermentation,"3.5 Characteristics of hydrogen fermentation The hydrogen production was usually accompanied with the key VFAs (expressed as volatile fatty acids) and alcohols produced, and both concentration distributions and their fractions were useful indicators for monitoring hydrogen production. Therefore, both were selected as main by-products of the strain F.p 01 consuming maltose in the fixed maltose concentration of 10 g/L and medium pH value of 5.0. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . As can be seen from Fig. 5, butyrate and acetate were two main by-products in the batch tests, and both reached maximum yields of 1052 mg/L and 299 mg/L at hour 56, respectively, and accounted for about 70–75% of the total VFAs, followed by small amounts of butanol and ethanol, as well as trace level of propionate. The producing hydrogen stopped when the substrate was exhausted, and both VFAs and alcohol as metabolic by-products were left in the reactor. The high butyrate concentrations revealed that the fermentation process of the strain F.p 01 consuming maltose was belong to butyrate fermentation type, which was considered to be the main fermentation type of bio-hydrogen production bacteria. These phenomena could be expected because the acetate and butyrate producers were active in contrast to the propionate producer during the hydrogen production process. To effectively convert the substrate into bio-hydrogen using the microorganisms, the activity of the propionate producer should be suppressed."
14,Conclusions,"A producing hydrogen strain F.P 01 was newly isolated from cow dung compost in an anaerobic bioreactor, which was a mesophilic and facultative anaerobic strain belonging to E. cloacae. Hydrogen production characteristics from dark fermentation of maltose by the strain F.P 01 were systematically investigated in the batch tests. The results indicated that the concentration of substrate and medium pH level significantly affected the hydrogen production."
