0,Introduction,"Intracellular viscosity is an important microenvironmental parameter, which plays an important role in the transport of intracellular viscosity, the basic microenvironment of signals and the interaction between biomolecules [1–3]. Abnormal changes in viscosity are considered to be an important cause of many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) [4]. mitochondria are important organelles that provide energy for cells. More and more evidence also shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is closely related to PD. In addition, the viscosity of mitochondrial matrix is closely related to its respiratory state. Therefore, the viscosity can be effectively observed by the state and activity of mitochondria [5]. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important gas transmission signal, which has been recognized to mediate a wide range of physiological processes, such as vasodilation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, inflammation and neuroregulation [6–10]. H2S biology is related to some organelles such as mitochondria. PD is a progressive disease that causes dementia and affects about 10% of people over the age of 65. Memory loss is the first sign of cognitive impairment, followed by behavioral disorders [11]. Understanding the pathogenesis of PD will provide a basis for early treatment and intervention, thus delaying the progress of PD in elderly individuals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop dual detection methods of viscosity and H2S in order to better understand the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, the development of effective detection tools for monitoring H2S and viscosity is of great significance for the investigation and diagnosis of PD. Although a variety of reasonably designed fluorescent probes for H2S [12–17] or viscosity [17–21] have been manufactured in recent years, due to design defects, there are few probes that can effectively detect viscosity and H2S. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design a fluorescent probe for multi-biomolecule detection at the same time. It is reported that a bifunctional probe based on BODIPY exhibits ""on"" and proportional fluorescence response with the increase of viscosity and concentration of H2S in living cells [22]. In addition, bifunctional fluorescent probes (Mito-VS) of viscosity and H2S have been successfully used to study the crosstalk between viscosity and H2S in mitochondria and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [23]. The mechanism for the detection of H2S by these bifunctional probes is mainly based on the reduction of azide, which leads to the ""on"" fluorescence phenomenon [24]. However, because these probes are excited by ultraviolet rays, azides can be broken down by ultraviolet rays, and the probes may produce wrong signals. Therefore, a new type of double-response probe with improved photostability for viscosity and H2S is needed. Inspired by this, we designed and synthesized a dual-response mitochondrial targeting fluorescence probe N-ThA for detecting viscosity and H2S. It shows weak fluorescence in non-viscous medium. With the increase of viscosity the fluorescence intensity of the probe at 730 nm wavelength increases significantly which proves that it acts as a molecular rotor and can be used to detect the change of viscosity. At the same time, the probe shows a fast ""on"" fluorescence response to H2S and has high selectivity. In addition, N-ThA has good mitochondrial targeting ability. The probe is also used to image the viscosity changes caused by nystatin on the red channel and to visualize the exogenous and endogenous H2S concentrations on the blue channel. In addition, with the promotion of this probe, the changes of viscosity in Parkinson's disease model (PC-12 cells treated with glutamate) were also successfully imaged. The results show that the viscosity of PD model is higher than that of normal model. In addition, we also carried out biological experiments, which also confirmed the above conclusion. This probe will have potential value in the study of the pathogenesis of PD and provide a tool for further understanding the physiological and pathological significance of viscosity and H2S."

3,Results and discussion,
4,Spectral analysis of N-ThA to H2S,"3.1 Spectral analysis of N-ThA to H2S Compared with the H2S sensing strategy based on its strong reducibility, such as reducing the nitro group/nitrogen alcohol to an amine reaction [25–27], Michael addition reaction has become another promising strategy of H2S fluorescent probe because of its high selectivity and reactivity [28] (see Scheme 1). Based on the evidence of spectral data, the possible response mechanism of N-ThA to viscosity is proposed (Scheme 2 ). In a non-viscous or low-viscosity environment, there is intramolecular free rotation between naphalactam and thiophene aldehyde, resulting in very weak fluorescence by forming a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. However, in a high-viscosity environment, rotation is restricted, hindering the formation of the TICT state, and therefore strong fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1 A, when excited at 385 nm, after adding H2S to PBS: DMSO = 7:3 (v/v, pH = 7.4), a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity at 516 nm can be seen. The six-fold increase in fluorescence intensity indicates that N-ThA is one of the sensitive H2S detection kits available in abiotic systems. As shown in Fig. 1B, in the range of 0–50 μM, there is a linear correlation between fluorescence intensity and H2S concentration. The UV–Vis spectrum response of N-ThA to H2S was studied in PBS: DMSO = 7:3 (v/v, pH = 7.4). 15 min after adding H2S, the UV–Vis spectrum of the probe was recorded as Fig. S4A. We can observe the enhanced absorption peaks of the probe at 400 nm and 590 nm. This change indicates that the π-conjugated structure of N-ThA grows after reacting with H2S. Because the pH dependence is very important for biochemical applications in the system, in a PBS: DMSO = 7:3 (v/v, pH = 7.4) solution, the H2S-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of N-ThA were studied at pH 3–10. As shown in Fig. 2 A, after adding H2S to N-ThA at pH 7.4, the fluorescence enhancement response is obvious, which indicates that the H2S fluorescent probe works well at physiological pH 7.4. In order to study its special recognition ability, we conducted experiments with a fluorescence spectrometer. Fig. 2B shows the fluorescence spectrum changes after adding various analytes to PBS: DMSO = 7:3 (v/v, pH = 7.4), including (NO3 −; I−; SO3 2−; S2O3 2−; Br−; Cl−; F−; NO2 −; CH3COO−; OH−; . O2; ONOO−; Cys; Glycine; GSH; H2O2; Hcy; l-Cystine; l-Glutamate; l-Lysine; l-Proline; SO4 2−; SNP; TBHP; Na+; Mg2+; Ca2+; K+). The change of fluorescence intensity indicates that fluorescence enhancement only occurs when it reacts with H2S. N-ThA shows excellent selectivity to H2S in various analytes in non-biological systems. In addition, a time-dependent modulation of the fluorescence spectrum of N-ThA (10 μM) was detected in the presence of 50 μM H2S. The time course indicated that the H2S reaction was completed within 8 min, indicating that N-ThA can detect H2S in non-biological systems (Fig. S4B)."
5,Spectroscopic response of N-ThA to viscosity,"3.2 Spectroscopic response of N-ThA to viscosity In addition to H2S, the fluorescence response of different ratios of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and glycerol to the viscosity of the N-ThA probe was also studied. As shown in Fig. 3 A, when the viscosity increased from 1.03 CP (100% PBS) to 902.52 CP (10% PBS and 90% glycerol), the fluorescence intensity of N-ThA (10 μM) at 730 nm increased with the increase in viscosity. It is worth noting that there is a good linear relationship between the logarithm of fluorescence intensity of the probe and the logarithm of viscosity in the range of viscosity 1.03 CP∼954.52 CP. The linear relationship equation is log I730 nm = 12.631 (viscosity)+82.762 and the linear relationship number R2 = 0.985 (Fig. 3B), indicating that the fluorescent probe N-ThA is sensitive to viscosity, making it widely used in further viscosity-related research."
6,Cell experiment,"3.3 Cell experiment Based on the in vitro analysis of N-ThA's response to viscosity and H2S, we used HeLa cells as model cells to test the response of N-ThA to H2S and viscosities of living cells. First, we conducted cytotoxicity experiments, as shown in Fig. S8. As shown in Fig. S5, when HeLa cells were incubated with only 10 μM N-ThA at 37 °C for 15 min, weak red fluorescence was observed. H2S in cells is mainly obtained by cystathionine-g-lyase (CES) and cystathionine synthase (CBS) and other sulfur-containing amino acids (Cys) [29]. Therefore, adding exogenous cysteine to the cell can increase the content of H2S in the cell. In order to detect the endogenous production of H2S in living cells, the cells were stimulated with Cys for 30 min. Then incubate with N-ThA for 15 min, observe obvious blue fluorescence, and perform cell imaging. Cell imaging results show that the increase in fluorescence intensity is due to Cys treatment stimulating cells to produce H2S. Then, using NaHS as the hydrogen sulfide source in the cell imaging experiment, the HeLa cells pre-incubated with the probe were incubated with 5 μM, 10 μM H2S for 20 min, and the blue fluorescence was observed to increase gradually (Fig. S6). Next, we studied the response of N-ThA to changes of HeLa cell viscosity. According to the literature, nystatin is an ionophore that regulates the viscosity of mitochondria. Nystatin can induce changes in mitochondrial structure by disrupting ion balance, which leads to a substantial increase in mitochondrial viscosity [30]. When N-ThA and nystatin were mixed in vitro, the results showed that the fluorescence intensity did not change, indicating that the probe was not affected by nystatin and could be used to detect the change of viscosity in living cells. As shown in Fig. 4 , after 15 min of N-ThA (10 μM) treatment of HeLa cells, the cells showed a weak fluorescence signal. After pretreatment with nystatin (10 μM), under the same measurement conditions, the fluorescence of the red channel was significantly enhanced. Under the high viscosity induced by nystatin (10 μM), N-ThA was co-stained with the mitochondrial tracer Mito Tracker Red. In HeLa cells, the Pearson's R value between the N-ThA and Mito Tracker Red channels was 0.90. Beyond the relevant 0.5 threshold, the Pearson's R value between N-ThA and Mito Tracker Red channels in PC12 cells is 0.86. The above results prove that N-ThA can specifically detect changes in mitochondrial viscosity (Fig. 5 and Fig. S7). Encouraged by the above results, we investigated the potential application of N-ThA in detecting H2S and viscosity in PD models. Since glutamate is a recognized neurotoxin used to establish a Parkinson's disease model in cells [31], we use glutamate-treated PC12 cells as a cell model for Parkinson's disease. As shown in Fig. 6 , the fluorescence of PC12 cells pretreated with glutamate was significantly increased compared with untreated PC12 cells. This is because glutamate treatment caused significant oxidative stress and viscosity increase in PC12 cells. Based on the above cell experiments, we further studied in vivo fluorescence imaging of N-THA in nude mouse tumor model after injection of nystatin or Glu [32,33] (Fig. 7 ). The mice were first imaged with 10 μM N-THA injected into the tumor site. After the addition of nystatin and Glu, the red fluorescence signal was significantly enhanced as time went by. These conclusions are consistent with cells experiments."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, we designed and synthesized a dual-response mitochondrial targeted fluorescent probe N-THA for the detection of viscosity and H2S. N-THA emitted red fluorescence at 730 nm and showed good linearity with increasing viscosity. N-THA has high sensitivity and selectivity for H2S detection, and shows a fast ""on"" fluorescence response to H2S at 516 nm. In addition, N-THA had good mitochondrial targeting ability and a high Pearson colocalization coefficient (0.90). In addition, N-THA was used to image nystatin induced viscosity changes on the red channel and to visualize exogenous and endogenous H2S concentrations on the blue channel. In addition, facilitated by this probe, viscosity changes in a model of Parkinson's disease (PC-12 cells treated with glutamate) were successfully imaged. The results show that the PD model shows higher viscosity than the normal model. In addition, we also carried out biological experiments, which also confirmed the above conclusion. So N-THA will have potential value in the study of the pathogenesis of PD and provide a tool for further understanding the physiological and pathological significance of viscosity and H2S."
