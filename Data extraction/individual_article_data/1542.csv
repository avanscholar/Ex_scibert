0,Introduction,"Owing to a rapid development of global economy, fossil-energy consumption is increasing in recent years [1–3]. It is essential to find an alternative energy for energy crisis. Biomass is one of renewable and abundant resources on the earth [4]. Biomass conversion into liquid fuels or fine chemicals can decrease the consumption of fossil energy [5]. Currently, furfural, obtained from hydrolysis of pentosan or cellulose, is considered as a renewable biomass-based platform compound with wide utilization in biorefinery. Thus, the production of fine chemicals from furfural is of significant interest [6,7]. Typically, reduction of furfural is one of the most important biomass-based transformation to obtain furfuryl alcohol. The resulting furfuryl alcohol is a key organic raw material and has been used as a five-carbon building block not only in the synthesis of resin such as furfural resin, furan resin, furfuryl alcohol-urine resin, phenolic resin and so on [8,9], but also in the preparation of other fine chemicals including organic acids, plasticizers, solvents and rocket fuels [10,11]. Additionally, furfuryl alcohol has been widely applied in the industrial sectors involving dyes, synthetic fibers, rubber, pesticide and foundry [12]. Lots of studies focus on thermo-driven selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methyfuran with fascinating efficiency [13,14]. For instance, selective reduction of furfural to 2-methyfuran was reported by using Pt (111) modified with transition metals [15]. While, selective reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was examined by using Pd–Ru alloy supported on TiO2 [16]. Moreover, silica-supported various transition metals such as copper, nickel and palladium were investigated for furfural transformation [17]. It was reported that furfuryl alcohol was mainly produced by using Cu catalyst; while, both Pd and Ni catalysts yielded decarbonylation products. However, in most cases, low selectivity for furfural hydrogenation was observed due to its instability and the presence of various side reactions at high reaction temperature. Moreover, pressurized equipment with safety issues is another disadvantage for furfural hydrogenation. On this basis, photo-induced hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation under atmospheric pressure and mild reaction conditions arouse our interest. Typically, the use of visible light as a driven force provides a sustainable and environmentally friendly pathway for hydrogenation of biomass-based aldehydes. The design of novel semiconductor photocatalysts thus plays a key role on selective hydrogenation of biomass-based aldehydes. Recently, polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted great attentions due to its excellent physicochemical stability and unique electronic ability. g-C3N4 has shown wide applications in thermo-catalytic field as a novel support [18–21] and in photocatalytic field as a catalyst [22–25] for water splitting [26], CO2 fixation [27,28], organic pollutant degradation [29] and artificial photosynthesis [30]. Compared with classical inorganic semiconductor, the organic g-C3N4 is low-cost, readily available, and environmentally benign [31]. However, several drawbacks, including fast recombination rate of electron–hole pairs and unsatisfactory photo-response, restrict the photocatalytic performance of pristine g-C3N4 [32]. Therefore, various methods were applied to enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, involving embedding elements [33–35] and small molecule substances inside the structure of g-C3N4 [36–38], coupling with electronic conductive materials [39,40], sensitizing the g-C3N4 nanosheets with semiconductor materials [41] and other dye [42], exfoliating g-C3N4 into nanosheets [43], modifying the g-C3N4 surface [44], and designing a nanostructure by template [45,46]. One of the most important strategies to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is to immobilize some noble metals on its surface. The resulting noble-metal NPs-supported semiconductor g-C3N4 is also named as plasmonic photocatalyst, in which the collective coherent oscillation on the surface of the noble metal, including Au, Ag, Pt and Pd [47–50] could lead to an effect of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The SPR effect thus enables these noble metal NPs to strongly absorb both UV and visible light [51,52]. Hence, the noble-metal NPs on the g-C3N4 make it to be a visual ray absorber and thermal redox active center, significantly extending its photocatalytic performance [53]. In this work, we demonstrate a green and renewable process for hydrogenation of biomass-based aldehydes with visible light as a driven force and Pd/g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst. The obtained plasmonic photocatalyst Pd/g-C3N4 exhibits a mean Pd NP size of 2.5 nm with a sharp size distribution on the support surface. Furthermore, the Pd/g-C3N4 displays excellent photocatalytic performance towards the hydrogenation of furfural with furfuryl alcohol yield of 27% and TOF around 3.72 h−1 in the presence of TEA-HCOOH. Moreover, the Pd/g-C3N4 is also applicable in the reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural with the resulting 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran yield of 39%."
1,Experiment section,"g-C3N4, mesoporous g-C3N4 (mpg-C3N4) were prepared according to the literature methods [24,54]. Details about the preparations of Pd/g-C3N4, Pd/mpg-C3N4 and Pd/M-g-C3N4 were available in the supporting information based on the reported methods with slight modifications. In a typical experiment procedure for furfural hydrogenation, a mixture of CH3CN (4.0 mL), Pd/g-C3N4 (30 mg), HCOOH (0.4 mL), furfural (15 mg), triethylamine (0.6 mL) was loaded into a Pyrex test tube with a magnetic stir bar. The mixture was irradiated under visible light (210 W Xenon lamp, λ > 420 nm) with vigorous stirring for 6 h. The resulting mixture was filtered after the reaction and the obtained filtrate was analyzed by Gas Chromatography."
2,Results and discussion,"In this research, for comparison purpose, g-C3N4, mpg-C3N4 and transition metal-doped g-C3N4 (M-g-C3N4, M = Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ce, La) were investigated as supports of Pd catalysts for the photo-induced hydrogenation. The porosity and pore size distribution of various catalysts were investigated by nitrogen sorption isothermal analysis (Fig. 1 ) and Table 1 shows the resulting data of the textural properties. The bared g-C3N4 shows low BET surface area of 18.56 m2 g−1 which is very close to that of Pd/g-C3N4. However, decreased BET surface areas of Pd/La-g-C3N4 and Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 were observed if compared with Pd/g-C3N4. This observation is presumably attributed to transformation of lanthanum nitrate and chromium nitrate into metal oxides in the Pd/La-g-C3N4 and Pd/Cr-g-C3N4, respectively, resulting in pore blocking [55,56]. However, mpg-C3N4 has a surface area of 173.67 m2 g−1 which is significantly higher than that of g-C3N4 sample. Fig. 2 shows the characterization of Pd samples and their corresponding supports by X-ray diffraction (XRD). For g-C3N4, characteristic diffraction peaks at 13.1° and 27.5° were observed. Among them, the strong peak at 27.5° is attributed to the (002) plane of conjugated inter-layers with stacking structure in g-C3N4 [57]. In addition, the weak signal at 13.1° is assigned to the (100) plane of tri-s-triazine in g-C3N4 with ordering structure (JCPDS No.87–1526). Results of XRD analysis of g-C3N4 indicates a highly ordered crystalline structure with graphene features, which is in line with the reported reference (JCPDS No.87–1526). For Pd/g-C3N4 with various Pd loading level, the diffraction peaks of Pd species were unobserved (JCPDS No.88–2335), which is presumably due to small Pd NPs with a high dispersion over the support surface. Additionally, the Pd/g-C3N4 shows almost the same diffraction patterns with pure g-C3N4, thus confirming unchanged crystal structure of the g-C3N4 support during the Pd loading process. In contrast to g-C3N4, both Cr-g-C3N4 and La-g-C3N4 exhibit decreased intensities of the characteristic diffraction peaks, indicating a slightly distorted stacking in the conjugated inter-layers [58–60]. As expected, both Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4 show decreased intensities of characteristic peak (002) than Pd/g-C3N4. Fig. 3 a–c show the TEM images of freshly made 3%Pd/g-C3N4 and the corresponding distribution histogram of Pd NPs. Homogeneous Pd NPs are highly dispersed throughout the g-C3N4 surface. Notably, the Pd NPs, loaded on g-C3N4, show an average particle size around 2.5 nm without any obvious agglomeration owing to the outstanding stabilization role of amine functional groups of g-C3N4. Moreover, the lattice fringes of Pd NPs on the g-C3N4 could be clearly observed, indicating an excellent crystallinity of Pd NPs (Fig. 3f). The average lattice fringe of 0.19 nm is indexed as the (200) lane facet of Pd species. In the case of 4.4%Pd/g-C3N4, an average particle size around 4.8 nm with an obvious agglomeration is observed, which is significantly different from 3%Pd/g-C3N4 (Fig. 3g and h). To further investigate the relationship between catalyst morphology and photocatalytic performance, the recycled catalysts were also analyzed by the TEM, showing an evident agglomeration of Pd NPs on the support (Fig. 3d and e). The mean NP size of the Pd in recycled Pd/g-C3N4 raises from 7.21 to 9.27 nm with the increase of recycling times from two to four runs. Additionally, the effect of support on the Pd NPs reveals that both Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4 have similar architecture with Pd/g-C3N4 (Fig. 3i and j). The surface chemical components of various Pd catalysts and their corresponding valence states were explored with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Four peaks related to carbon, nitrogen, palladium and oxygen, respectively, were all observed in survey scans of Pd/g-C3N4, Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4 (Fig. 4 a, and Table 2 ). High-resolution scans for the above-mentioned four elements were then investigated. Pd 3d XPS of Pd/g-C3N4 could be deconvolved into two sets of separated peaks with the difference value of 5.3 eV between Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 [61] (Fig. 4b). One of them with high intensities at 334.8 and 340.1 eV was assigned as Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 [62], indicating the existence of Pd(0) species (Table 3 ). Meanwhile, another two weak peaks, located at 342.4 and 337.2 eV, were respectively indexed as Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2, indicating the existence of Pd(II) (Table 3) [63]. Based on integral areas of these peaks, the content of metallic Pd0 is 80%, indicating a successful reduction of Pd2+ to give a predominant Pd0 in Pd/g-C3N4 via NaBH4-reduction method. Pd 3d XPS of Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4 are very close to Pd/g-C3N4, showing two major doublet peaks. However, the binding energies of Pd 3d XPS signals in both Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4 show positive shifts in contrary to those of Pd/g-C3N4. Positive binding energy shift of 0.7 eV between Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd2+ 3d5/2 is observed for Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and positive binding energy shift of 0.4 eV between Pd0 3d5/2 and Pd2+ 3d5/2 is also observed for Pd/La-g-C3N4, demonstrating a decrease of electron density on Pd NPs after La or Cr are doped. Moreover, the percentage of metallic Pd0 is only 45% in Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and 58% in Pd/La-g-C3N4 (Table 3). For N 1s XPS, the N 1s line of Pd/g-C3N4 could be deconvolved into three distinct signals at 398.4, 399.7 and 401.0 eV, which is respectively assigned to the sp 2-hybridized nitrogen atoms in C–NC [40,64], sp 3-hybridized tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3, and the amino group carrying hydrogen (C–N–H). The above analysis thus demonstrates the presence of triazine rings and defects (Fig. 4c) [8,65,66]. Especially, the percentage of amino group in Pd/g-C3N4 is lower when compared with those in Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4, indicating the influence of the dropped metal on the generation of triazine rings in the g-C3N4. C 1s XPS is fitted into three main signals located at 288.0, 286.0 and 284.6 eV, which is respectively indexed to sp 2-hybridized carbon (N–CN), C–NH2 species and sp 2 C–C species (Fig. 4d) [40,66]. For La 3d XPS, the La 3d line of Pd/La-g-C3N4 could be fitted into two groups of double peaks. One is located at 834.5 and 837.8 eV and the other is centered at 851.1 and 854.7 eV, corresponding to the La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2, respectively. A split of 3.3 eV of La 3d5/2 was observed, indicating the presence of La2O2(CO3) [67]. Finally, Cr 3d XPS analysis was not obtained due to low content of Cr in Pd/Cr-g-C3N4. The optical properties of various samples were investigated by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) as shown in Fig. 5 . Three supports including g-C3N4, mpg-C3N4 and La-g-C3N4 show absorption wavelengths at around 460, 468 and 470 nm, respectively. In the case of the corresponding Pd catalysts, the absorption wavelengths of Pd/g-C3N4, Pd/mpg-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4 further increase to 519, 492 and 521 nm, respectively, due to the deposition of Pd NPs and the resulting SPR effect. In addition, the band gap values of g-C3N4 (2.69 eV), mpg-C3N4 (2.65 eV), La-g-C3N4 (2.63 eV), Pd/g-C3N4 (2.39 eV), Pd/mpg-C3N4 (2.52 eV) and Pd/La-g-C3N4 (2.38 eV) are obtained by the formula of Eg = 1240/λ, where Eg stands for gap value and λ is the cutoff wavelength of the investigated samples [57] (Table 4 ). Therefore, narrow band gap and increased absorption wavelength should have a positive effect on the photocatalysts. Moreover, the absorption spectra further reveal that all catalysts can be excited under the irradiation of visible light. Therefore, it is reasonable that the photo-induced hydrogenation of furfural can be conducted under the visible light (λ > 420 nm) in this research. In this study, photo-induced selective reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was initially investigated with Pd/g-C3N4, using TEA and HCOOH as sacrificial electron donator and proton source, respectively. Photo-induced hydrogenation was performed with a Xenon lamp (λ > 420 nm) as visible-light source. To start with, a mixture of furfural, Pd/g-C3N4 and TEA-HCOOH in CH3CN was irradiated with visible light. Surprisingly, furfuryl alcohol yield of 27% with furfural conversion of 32% were observed under the above-mentioned conditions (Table 5 , entry 3). However, a reference experiment with Pd/g-C3N4 and TEA-HCOOH, while, without photo-irradiation shows a furfuryl alcohol yield of 7% (Table 5, entry 4), indicating a significant promotion effect of the visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the blank irradiation experiments demonstrate that furfuryl alcohol could not be obtained without the addition of Pd/g-C3N4 or TEA-HCOOH based on GC analysis (Table 5, entries 1, 5), indicating a synergistic effect of Pd/g-C3N4 and TEA-HCOOH on the hydrogenation reaction. Pure g-C3N4 was further investigated for furfural hydrogenation in order to figure out the catalytic performance of Pd NPs on the catalyst (Table 5, entry 2). However, no hydrogenation product of furfural was observed with pristine g-C3N4. Our UV-Vis DRS results reveal that the loading of Pd NPs can improve the light absorption of the resulting catalyst, thus leading to a better photocatalytic performance [50]. Moreover, previous researches reported the outstanding photocatalytic activity of various Pt-based photo-catalysts. Hence, apart from Pd/g-C3N4, the catalytic performance of Pt/g-C3N4 in furfural hydrogenation was also investigated (Table 5, entry 6). However, no furfuryl alcohol product was observed and the furfural conversion was negligible, further indicating a positive effect of Pd NPs in the photo-induced furfural hydrogenation. In addition to Pd/g-C3N4, the photo-catalytic synthesis of furfuryl alcohol was also tested with Pd/mpg-C3N4. mpg-C3N4 was obtained with the addition of silica as hard template to improve the porosity, configurational and electronic properties of g-C3N4. Although mpg-C3N4 have some particular semiconductor performances such as large surface area and crystalline pore wall, 3%Pd/mpg-C3N4 shows a definitely lower catalytic performance if compared with 3%Pd/g-C3N4 (Table 5, entry 3 and 7). This observation is presumably related to a higher band gap value of Pd/mpg-C3N4 (2.58 eV) when compared with Pd/g-C3N4 (2.39 eV). Moreover, a high surface area and porous structure of mpg-C3N4 may enhance hydrogen bond interactions between mpg-C3N4 surface and furfural/furfural alcohol molecules, thus leading a strong absorption of these molecules over the Pd/mpg-C3N4 surface [62]. The decreased catalytic performance of Pd/mpg-C3N4 may also be attributed to the strong adsorption of furfural and furfural alcohol over Pd/mpg-C3N4, which results in a photo-induced decomposition. Notably, 5%Pd/mpg-C3N4 shows a negligible photocatalytic performance in spite of the increased Pd loading level (Table 5, entry 8). In addition to g-C3N4 and mpg-C3N4, various M-g-C3N4 (M = Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ce, La) were investigated as the supports of Pd catalysts for the photo-induced hydrogenation. While, the photocatalytic activity of these Pd catalysts show great difference among each other. For Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and Pd/La-g-C3N4, their photo-induced catalytic activities are slightly higher than Pd/g-C3N4 with the furfuryl alcohol yields over 30% (Table 5, entries 9, 10 and 3). The UV-Vis DRS analysis has confirmed that the doping of rare earth element La leads to a red shift in the absorption spectra and, therefore, can improve its photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5) [68]. Pd/Ni-g-C3N4 shows comparable catalytic hydrogenation performance with Pd/g-C3N4 (Table 5, entries 11 and 3). For Pd/M-g-C3N4 (M = Co, Cu, Zn and Ce), quite low furfuryl alcohol yields were observed during the photo-induced hydrogenation (Table 5, entries 12–15). Except for the yield of furfuryl alcohol, turnover frequency (TOF) was also studied to determine the photocatalytic performance of the above Pd catalysts. In this research, TOFs for the investigated catalysts in the photo-induced furfural-to-furfuryl alcohol transformation was measured under a low furfural conversion level (5–10%) and calculated according to the obtained yield of furfuryl alcohol under per amount of Pd per hour. The resulting TOFs were 3.72 h−1 for Pd/g-C3N4, 4.08 h−1 for Pd/Cr-g-C3N4, 3.89 h−1 for Pd/La-g-C3N4, and 3.13 h−1 for Pd/Ni-g-C3N4. To figure out the influence of semi-conductor support on the photo-induced reduction, the hydrogenation was also performed with Pd catalysts supported on commercially available and traditional semi-conductor supports such as Pd/P25, Pd/CeO2 and Pd/TNT (TNT, titanate nanotube); however, all of these catalysts show negligible furfuryl alcohol yields (Table 5, entries 16–18). The impact of Pd loading levels in Pd/g-C3N4 on its photocatalytic performance was also investigated. The furfuryl alcohol yield smoothly raises up to 27% with the optimized Pd loading of 3.6 wt% (Fig. 6 ), revealing that photocatalytic performance is greatly influenced by the amount of active Pd species. Nevertheless, furfuryl alcohol yield drops slightly when the Pd loading increases to more than 4.4 wt% (Fig. 6). This result is presumably related to an obvious increase of average nanoparticle size from 2.5 nm for 3%Pd/g-C3N4 to 4.8 nm for 4.4%Pd/g-C3N4 (Fig. 3a and h). The increased nanoparticle size with an obvious agglomeration may reduce catalytic active sites and lead to a decreased catalytic performance. Several experiments were also launched to verify the effect of catalyst amount on the photocatalytic performance. Furfuryl alcohol yield gradually increases with the addition of catalyst amount up to 30 mg (Fig. 6), suggesting an increase of availability and accessibility of the Pd active species. However, a decrease in furfuryl alcohol yield was observed with further increase of catalyst amount. This result is presumably related to the fact that photochemical reaction rate is generally determined by electron-transfer kinetics and absorption effect. Therefore, furfuryl alcohol yield decreases beyond an optimal catalyst loading level due to side-reaction and strong adsorption of product on the catalyst [69,70]. These observations thus reveal that the amount and accessibility of the catalyst should control the reaction rate when the catalyst amount is less than 30 mg with Pd loading level less than 3.6 wt%. Various aldehydes were investigated in the visible-light induced hydrogenation with Pd/g-C3N4 and TEA-HCOOH, as shown in Table 6 . Apart from furfural, another biomass-based 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was readily converted into the 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with a yield of 39% (Table 6, entry 1). The photocatalytic activity of various Pd-based photocatalysts for HMF-to-DHMF transformation were further compared in terms of TOFs. The obtained TOFs were 4.49 h−1 for Pd/g-C3N4, 4.77 h−1 for Pd/Cr-g-C3N4 and 5.03 h−1 for Pd/La-g-C3N4. In addition to furan ring-containing aldehydes, benzaldehyde and its derivatives were subsequently investigated by the photo-induced hydrogenation under the investigated conditions. Benzaldehyde was hydrogenated to benzyl alcohol with yield of 66% (Table 6, entry 2) and the resulting TOFs of benzyl alcohol formation is up to 15.82 h−1 over Pd/g-C3N4 under a low conversion rate of benzaldehyde. The reduction of methyl-substituted benzaldehydes to corresponding alcohols using Pd/g-C3N4 as photocatalyst was investigated. Owing to steric hindrance effect, both p-methyl-benzaldehydes conversion and its corresponding alcohol yield are the highest among the three methyl-benzaldehydes (Table 6, entries 3–5). In addition, both the conversions and the corresponding alcohol yields rank in the order of benzaldehyde > p-methyl benzaldehyde > p-ethyl benzaldehyde (Table 6, entry 2, 3, 6). Finally, high conversion of p-chlorobenzaldehyde was observed during the hydrogenation. However, the final product is a mixture of benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol and p-chlorobenzyl alcohol (Table 6, entry 7). Finally, recycling experiments of Pd/g-C3N4 for the photo-induced hydrogenation of furfural were performed under the optimal reaction condition. The recovered Pd/g-C3N4 was gathered through filtration after the irradiation, completely washed by water/ethanol and dried at 80 °C under the vacuum overnight before the next cycle. As shown in Fig. 7 , an obvious decrease of the catalytic performance of Pd/g-C3N4 was observed during its five-recycling experiments. This observation is presumably associated with agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles during the hydrogenation procedure as proven by the TEM images of Pd/g-C3N4 (Fig. 3a, d, e). Therefore, an adequate interaction between substrate furfural and the active metal sites of Pd is partially suppressed. Notably, Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst shows excellent recycling-stability without any detectable leaching of Pd (< 0.1 mg L−1) as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis after each recycling."
3,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated the furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol at room temperature under visible-light irradiation using Pd/g-C3N4 as photocatalyst. In this process, triethylamine acts as electron donor and HCOOH functions as hydrogen source. The reaction process is safe and easy to handle under ambient condition. The Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibits distinguished photocatalytic performance in furfural hydrogenation with 32% conversion and furfuryl alcohol yield of 27%, which is significantly higher than using other Pd catalysts with classical semi-conduct supports such as TiO2, CeO2 and P25. Moreover, the Pd/g-C3N4 can promote the photo-induced hydrogenation not only for furfural, but also for various aromatic aldehyde such as HMF, benzaldehyde and various substituted benzaldehyde."
