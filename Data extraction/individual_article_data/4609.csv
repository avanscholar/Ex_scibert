0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a clean oxidant, which has important applications in industrial production, environmental remediation and biological process [1–3]. In the field of environmental remediation, H2O2 possesses strong oxidizing properties that can directly oxidize or indirectly combine other technologies to degrade many organic and inorganic pollutants [4–6]. O2 is the main product originating from H2O2, which is an environmentally friendly oxidant that can be used in many industrial productions, including organic synthesis, textile bleaching and fuel cells [7,8]. Nowadays, the main methods for large-scale production of H2O2 involve anthraquinone autoxidation, alcohol oxidation and electrochemical synthesis [9–11]. However, a large amount of energy or chemicals are handled during these processes, which will cause some serious security risks. In addition, the H2O2 produced by these methods will contain some impurities and cannot be easily separated. Hence, it is imminent to study some low-cost, safe and green methods to produce H2O2. The characteristics of low cost, safety and eco-friendliness of semiconductor photocatalysis technology endow it as one of the most valuable methods for producing H2O2 [12,13]. In this process, H2O2 is generated by the photoreduction of O2 in H2O [14]. Since ample sunlight can be used as a driving force, semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted widespread attention. According to previous reports, TiO2 is usually used as an effective photocatalyst to generate H2O2 under ultraviolet light [15–19]. However, self-decomposition of H2O2 will be caused under ultraviolet light. In addition, ultraviolet light accounts for only ∼4% of the solar spectrum [20]. Therefore, it is crucial to design photocatalysts that can effectively produce H2O2 under visible light. Among various photocatalytic materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted the interest of many researchers due to its better visible light absorption, high chemical stability, simple synthesis method and excellent environmental friendliness [21–25]. Since the conduction band potential (−1.3 V) of g-C3N4 is higher than the reduction potential of O2/H2O2 (0.695 V), it can reduce O2 to H2O2 under visible light [14]. For example, Shiraishi et al. reported that g-C3N4 can produce H2O2 with high selectivity in an aqueous solution containing ethanol as a sacrificial reagent with O2 under visible light irradiation [26]. However, some disadvantages such as the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and small specific surface area in traditional 2D g-C3N4 will result in poor chemical adsorption of oxygen on the surface of the catalyst and seriously impedes its photocatalytic performance for the production of H2O2 [27–29]. Therefore, exploring the modification of g-C3N4 to enhance its photocatalytic ability to produce H2O2 is a challenging task. Compared with 2D nano-sheet structure of g-C3N4, the 1D hollow structure of g-C3N4 can significantly increase its specific surface area, which will provide more surface-active sites. Simultaneously, its hollow tubular structure can enhance the migration of photogenerated electrons to the catalyst surface, and electrons with a longer lifetime can participate in photocatalytic reactions to achieve higher photocatalytic performance. For example, Ge et al. reported that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of tubular g-C3N4 (TCN) was about 16 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 under visible light due to the large specific surface area, numerous active sites, increased visible light harvesting capability and the improved separation efficiency of charge carriers of TCN [30]. Guo et al. found that hexagonal tube g-C3N4 showing higher photocatalytic activity than 2D g-C3N4, indicating that 1D g-C3N4 is beneficial to hydrogen evolution [31]. Zhou et al. compared the photocatalytic activity of H2O2 production between 1D and 2D g-C3N4. The H2O2 produced by g-C3N4 1D nanotube reached 20 μM after 30 min under simulated sunlight, which is approximately 2.3 times higher than that of 2D g-C3N4 [32]. They believe that the 1D tubular structure can provide additional polar surface reaction sites and improve its mass transfer to increase H2O2 production. Zhang et al. prepared the unique 1D TiO2@MWCNTs (multiwall carbon nanotubes) nanocomposites by a facile hydrothermal method [33]. Under optimized conditions, the 1D TiO2@MWCNTs exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than that of anatase TiO2 and P25. Based on the above inspiration, controlling the morphology of g-C3N4 with 1D hollow nanostructures may be an efficient strategy to cope with the deficiencies of traditional 2D g-C3N4 photocatalyst and improve its photocatalytic activity. In this study, by changing the structure of the CN precursor with hydrothermal treatment, the 1D carbon nitride hexagonal prisms (CNHP) with hollow structure is successfully synthesized. The hollow structure of CNHP enlarges its specific surface area, thereby effectively improving the adsorption capacity of oxygen on the surface. At the same time, the hollow tubular structure of CNHP greatly improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, the hollow structure of CNHP greatly improves the ability of g-C3N4 to produce H2O2, the yield of H2O2 is about 7 times that of traditional 2D g-C3N4."

5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photocurrent response, Mott-Schottky curve measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the catalysts were measured using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China) in a three-electrode quartz reactor. To obtain a working electrode, supported the catalyst on the fluorinated tin oxide conductive glass (FTO) glass. Dispersed 2 mg of ethyl cellulose together with 20 mg of catalyst in 10 mL of C2H5OH. The mixed slurry was evenly dropped onto the pretreated FTO glass by dip-coating afterwards. After that, the processed FTO glass was dried in the air and activated at 120 °C for 3 h. For the Photocurrent response and Mott-Schottky curve measurements tests, the reactor was equipped with 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte solution. While EIS plot tests were conducted in the mixed aqueous solution of 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] as the electrolyte solution."
6,Photocatalytic H2O2 production,"2.5 Photocatalytic H2O2 production Typically, 25 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL deionized water containing 5 mL of isopropyl alcohol as a sacrificial agent. Next, the reactor containing the mixed solution was continuously with O2 flow in the dark, and continuously stirred for 30 min to achieve adsorption-desorption equilibrium. After that, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out under a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfect light Technology Co., Ltd., China, providing visible light λ > 420 nm) serving as the visible-light source. Took 2.5 mL of reaction solution every 10 min during this experiment, and filtered through a 0.22 mm filter to measure the content of H2O2 in the solution. The concentration of H2O2 production was measured by the colorimetric DPD method: phosphate buffer (pH=7) was prepared by dissolving 1.438 g K2HPO4·3H2O and 5.967 g KH2PO4 in 100 mL of deionized water.

8,Results and discussion,"The green fabrication of 1D carbon nitride hexagonal prisms (CNHP) with hollow structure using the method of first hydrothermal treatment and then high-temperature calcination is shown in Fig. 1 . Briefly, melamine is thoroughly dissolved in deionized water under ultrasonic conditions. Then the followed hydrothermal process can realize the in-situ conversion of melamine to the precursor of CNHP, which exhibits a solid hexagonal prism (Fig. S1). Finally, CNHP with hollow microstructure is obtained by calcining the white precursor at 500 °C for 2 h in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are performed to study the phase structure of pristine g-C3N4 (CN) and CNHP (Fig. 2 a). For CN, two obvious diffraction peaks appeared at 13.0° and 27.4° confirm its layered structure. The peak at 13.0° can be attributed to the in-plane structure stacking of the tri-s-triazine units. And the peak at 27.4° indicates the conjugated aromatic structures for graphite materials intermediate layer stack [34]. While this peak for CNHP shifts slightly to a higher angle (27.8°), which represents the interlayer spacing has been decreased. The reduced interlayer spacing results in shorter charge transfer distance, so that the excited electrons can migrate to the surface reaction sites more quickly. Besides, compared with CN, the peak centered at 27.8° becomes wider and weaker, indicating that the crystallite size of CNHP is smaller [35]. Similar infrared peaks of CN and CNHP can be found from the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. 2b). Specifically, the peak around 810 cm−1 belongs to the respiratory vibration of the triazine units, while the peaks between 1200 cm−1 and 1700 cm−1 are attributed to the main chain extension of CN heterocycles. In addition, the broadband of CN and CNHP from 3000 cm−1 to 3300 cm−1 is assigned to the NH tensile vibration of the incompletely condensed amine groups and adsorbed H2O molecules [36–38]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to study their chemical composition (Fig. 2c and d). C and N are the main elements as observed from the survey XPS spectra in CN and CNHP (Fig. S2). The differences between the C 1 s and N 1 s spectra of CN and CNHP are negligible. The two peaks at 284.6 and 288.0 eV in the C 1 s spectra are attributed to the tertiary carbon N C = N and CC groups, respectively [39,40]. Besides, there are three peaks in N 1 s spectra, which represent the sp2-hybridized nitrogen in triazine rings (C N = C) (398.7 eV), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups (399.6 eV), and for amino functional groups carrying hydrogen (CN-H) (401.1 eV), respectively [41]. The morphologies of as-prepared materials are then characterized. It can be seen from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the precursor of CNHP displays a hexagonal solid rod-like structure (Fig. S1). After calcination at 500 °C for 2 h, the transformation from solid hexagonal prism to hollow hexagonal prism has taken place (Fig. S3a). The morphology of the external tube is well maintained during the calcination process which is different from the nano-sheet morphology of CN (Fig. S3b, c and Fig. S4). In Fig. 3 a and b, the transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements further confirm the hexagonal prisms with hollow structure. It can be predicted that the hollow structure may enhance the activity due to the fast charge migration. In order to study the reasons for the formation of the special structure of CNHP, the XRD pattern and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the precursor of CNHP are analyzed. The peaks observed in the XRD pattern are sharp and dense, indicating the precursor is well-crystallized but not g-C3N4 (Fig. S5). Additionally, the TGA plots demonstrate that the precursor of CNHP starts to decompose at about 270 °C and decomposes completely at about 420 °C (Fig. S6a and b). The formation of the hollow hexagonal prism structure is attributed to the incomplete polymerization due to the release of CO2, NH3, NO2 and other gasses after the precursor pyrolysis, which is different from the pyrolysis of melamine. For the precursor of CNHP, because of the rapid crystallization in the initial stage of the hydrothermal reaction, there may be high-density defects in the center of the solid hexagonal prism [30,31]. Therefore, the pyrolysis of the precursor starts from the center of the hexagonal prism and gradually extends outward to form a hollow hexagonal prism structure. In addition, the XEDS energy mapping is shown in Fig. 3c, the elements of C and N are evenly distributed on CNHP, further indicating the formation of a hollow tubular structure. The morphology feature of CNHP is then verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 3d, the clear hole structure appears in the AFM image. As shown in Fig. 3e, the thickness of the CNHP tube wall is around 10–18 nm. As far as we know, this hollow tubular structure is beneficial to increase its specific surface area. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm also shows the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of CNHP is 41.513 m2/g, which is about 7 times that of CN (5.654 m2/g) (Fig. 3f). The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves is shown in Fig. S7, it can be seen that the CNHP exhibits a wide pore size distribution in the 10–150 nm region, due to a random pore formation induced by gas emission during the thermal polymerization. Notably, CNHP shows a mesopores of 10–40 nm pore size distribution. Besides, there are more macroporous distributed at 50–150 nm in CNHP. These pore structures are derived from the hollow tube structure and tube wall, which increases the surface area of CNHP to a certain extent. The much higher specific surface area is also reflected by the flocculent feature of CNHP. The inset in Fig. 3f shows the collected CN and CNHP with both 10 mg. Generally speaking, the performance of a certain photocatalyst is related to its light absorption capacity and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The light absorption characteristics of CN and CNHP are studied by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). As shown in Fig. 4 a, CNHP exhibits a slightly enhanced light absorption than CN in both visible and UV regions. The results suggest that light absorption has little influence on the activity. The band gaps of CN and CNHP are calculated by the Tauc approach are approximately 2.80 eV and 2.92 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). The flat-band potential of CN and CNHP can be known from the Mott-Schottky curve. As shown in Fig. 4c, the potential of the conduction band (E CB) and valence band (E VB) of CN and CNHP through Mulliken electronegativity theoretical equation: E CB = X - E 0 - 0.5 E g, E VB = E CB + E g. Among them, X represents the electronegativity value of the semiconductor, and E 0 corresponds to the electronegativity value of the standard hydrogen electrode (about 4.5 eV). For g-C3N4, X = 4.67 eV. In addition, the obtained positive slopes mean that CN and CNHP are both n-type semiconductors [42]. The detailed band structures of CN and CNHP are shown in Fig. 4d. Since there is no obvious difference in the light absorption between CN and CNHP, the factor affecting the photocatalytic activity mainly depends on the separation efficiency of their photogenerated carriers. In order to study the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers of CN and CNHP, a series of photoelectrochemical measurements are carried out. As shown in Fig. 5 a, both samples show rapid response to light on/off, indicating light-induced charge transfer and response. The photocurrent of CNHP is about 6 times higher than that of CN, which means that the separation of its charge carriers is more effective. The smaller arc radius of CNHP implies the promoted separation rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, this is equivalent to the photocurrent test result of the samples (Fig. 5b). Surface photovoltage (SPV) can detect the transport characteristics of the charge carriers generated by the samples under light (Fig. S8). The light response signal of CNHP is stronger than that of CN, indicating that its higher charge separation efficiency [43]. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of CNHP is weaker than that of CN (Fig. 5c), revealing the recombination of electrons and holes in CNHP is greatly suppressed. The time-resolved fluorescence decay spectrum in Fig. 5d indicates that CNHP has a longer carrier lifetime than CN, and we also give a summary of the relevant derived lifetime parameters (Table S1). The tubular structure of CNHP can enhance the migration of photogenerated electrons to the catalyst surface, and electrons with a longer lifetime can participate in photocatalytic reactions to achieve high efficiency. All of the above results show that the tubular structure of CNHP could promote electron-hole transfer and separation, which will help improve the photocatalytic performance of CNHP. The photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples are evaluated by H2O2 production from O2 reduction. The photocatalytic reactions are performed with isopropyl alcohol as proton donor. The result for H2O2 production over CN and CNHP photocatalysts under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 6 a and Fig. S9. Without any catalyst, no H2O2 is produced in the whole process. For CN, the amount of H2O2 produced is relatively low, only about 0.59 μmol after 40 min irradiation, indicating its poor photocatalytic activity. The amount of H2O2 produced by CNHP reaches 4.08 μmol under the same condition, which is about 7 times higher than that of CN. As far as we know, the performance of this CNHP photocatalytic production of H2O2 is also better than many reported g-C3N4 materials (Table S2). Meanwhile, the yield of H2O2 using seawater is measured under the same experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. S10, the amount of H2O2 produced is 4.18 μmol after 40 min of reaction in seawater. And no obvious change of the H2O2 production can be found over CNHP in seawater compared with the deionized water, indicating the seawater has little influence on the efficiency in this system. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of H2O2 production is then further investigated, and the AQE of CNHP at 420 nm is calculated to be 2.41% (Fig. 6b). In order to prove the production pathway of H2O2, 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) technique is employed to measure the ·O2 − in the photocatalytic process of the CNHP system. In Fig. 6c, no ESR signal is detected under dark conditions. When under light conditions, the characteristic signal of DMPO-·O2 − can be clearly observed. With the extension of irradiation time, the intensity of the signal characteristic peaks also increases. This indicates that photogenerated electrons can reduce O2 to ·O2 − and further reduce ·O2 − to H2O2 [44]. Since the oxidation of ·O2 − to 1O2 (0.34 V vs NHE) is thermodynamically favored, the ·O2 − can be oxidized to 1O2 by h + [45]. The 1:1:1 triplet signal characteristic peaks on the ESR spectrum indicate the existence of the 1O2 (Fig. 6d), and the 1O2 can promote the ability of photocatalysis to produce H2O2 [46]."
