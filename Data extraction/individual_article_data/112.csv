0,Introduction,"Fatty alcohols are used for production of detergents, the manufacture of cosmetics and as additive for several formulations. Unsaturated alcohols have advantages over saturated alcohols due to the possibility of introducing functional groups [1]. For instance they can be used to produce polyurethane [2]. Due to the higher price of the unsaturated alcohol there is an interest to preserve the double bond CC. Fatty alcohols are produced industrially by hydrogenation of fatty acids and esters. The reaction is carried out at high pressure using copper chromite catalysts. However, due to environmental problems caused by Cr6+ various alternative catalysts have been developed, like CuZn, CuMn and CuFe [3,4]. Supported noble metal catalysts are very active for hydrogenation, but they have a lower selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. For this reason, the use of supported noble metal catalysts promoted with another transition metal was proposed in order to modulate their hydrogenating activity. The more studied noble metal promoted catalysts are Ru-Sn/Al2O3 and Co-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts [5–8]. Re/TiO2 catalysts were also successfully used to produce alcohol by hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids at a lower temperature (180 °C) and a lower pressure (5 MPa) [9,10]. In previous works hydrogenation of methyl oleate to oleyl alcohol and hydrogenation of oleic acid to oleyl alcohol, have been used to study the influence of some variables on the activity and selectivity of Ru-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. These variables were: Ru/Sn ratio, reaction conditions, preparation method and activation method [11–15]. Although rhodium possesses good hydrogenation activity and it can be used on several applications [16,17] there are very few reports on Rh heterogeneous catalysts for selective hydrogenation to fatty alcohols [18]. The hydrogenolysis of ethyl acetate over bimetallic Sn/Rh catalysts was studied by Candy et al. [19]. They reported that tin drastically changes the catalytic properties of rhodium strongly decreasing the formation of saturated hydrocarbons. Rh-Sn catalysts showed higher activity than Ru-Sn catalysts during the hydrogenation of methyl laurate and methyl palmitate [20]. A study of the hydrogenating properties of rhodium and the influence of tin as a promoter in bimetallic Rh-Sn-B/Al2O3 catalysts for the selective hydrogenation reaction of oleic acid to oleic alcohol is presented in this work."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation γ-Al2O3 was used as support (Cyanamid Ketjen CK-300, pore volume = 0.5 cm3 g−1, specific surface area (BET) = 180 m2 g−1, dp = 35–80 mesh). Aqueous solutions of RhCl3.2H2O and SnCl2.2H2O were used as precursors. The support was impregnated with the solution of RhCl3.2H2O or SnCl2.2H2O precursor in order to obtain the monometallic Rh (1 wt%)/Al2O3 or Sn (2 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst. Bimetallic catalysts of Rh (1 wt%) - Sn (percentage of Sn from 1 to 5 wt%) were prepared by co-impregnation of both precursor solutions. The impregnated samples were left to rest for 12 h. Then the catalysts were reduced with an aqueous solution of sodium borohydride. After that the samples were filtered, washed with distilled water (until pH = 7), and dried at 100 °C for 4 h. Finally they were activated by reduction in H2 at 300 °C for 2 h."
3,Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES),"2.2 Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) The content of the metal phase (Rh, Sn, B) of the catalysts was determined by this technique after digestion in an acid solution. The equipment used was a Perkin Elmer Optima 2100 DV. Specific Surface area (BET): They were determined at −196 °C in an automatic Micromeritics ASAP-2000 equipment. The BET method was used in the range of 0.05 < P/P0 <0.27."
4,Temperature programmed reduction (TPR),"2.3 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) The analyses were carried out in an equipment with thermal conductivity detector. The reduction was carried out from room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, in a gaseous stream of 5.0% H2 in Ar. Previously the samples were calcined at 400 °C (air, 1 h)."
5,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"2.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) A Multitechnique System (SPECS) was used. This was equipped with a dual X-ray source of Mg/Al and a PHOIBOS 150 semispherical analyzer operating in fixed mode (FAT). The spectra were obtained with a step energy of 30 eV, the X-ray source Mg Kα was operated at 200 W and 12 kV. The data was processed using the Casa XPS program (Casa Software Ltd., UK). The samples were pretreated with H2/Ar at 300 °C before the XPS analyses. Calibration of the spectra was performed with the C 1s transition at 284.6 eV."
6,Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and hydrogenolysis of cyclopentane,"2.5 Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and hydrogenolysis of cyclopentane The catalyst (50 mg for cyclohexane dehydrogenation and 80 mg for cyclopentane hydrogenolysis) was charged to a fixed-bed quartz reactor. The sample was activated by hydrogen flow at 500 °C (36 ml min−1, 1 h). The reactions were carried out at 300 °C, at atmospheric pressure and with a molar ratio H2/CH = 14 and H2/CP = 18. The products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific Trace 1300, Phenomenex capillary column ZB-5, FID detector)."
7,CO chemisorption,"2.6 CO chemisorption The catalyst was placed in the reactor and reduced in hydrogen flow (500 °C, 1 h, 60 cm3 min−1). Then N2 was fed for 1 h (500 °C, 60 cm3 min−1) in order to desorb the hydrogen. Then the cell was cooled down to room temperature. Finally pulses of CO (3.5% CO in N2) were fed to the reactor. Non chemisorbed CO was quantitatively transformed into CH4 over a Ni/Kieselgur catalyst and detected in a flame ionization detector connected on-line."
8,Hydrogenation of oleic acid,"2.7 Hydrogenation of oleic acid The experiments were carried out in a Parr-type reactor (280 cm3 capacity). The reaction conditions were 270 °C, 5.07 MPa and the stirring rate was 800 rpm. 1.00 g of catalyst, 3.50 g of oleic acid and 45.00 g of normal dodecane were charged. The reagents (oleic acid and n-dodecane) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (93% and 99% purity, respectively). The products of the reaction were analyzed by gas chromatography using a Shimadzu GC-2014 equipment and a 30 m Zebron ZB-FFAP. Chromatography conditions were as follows. FID detector temperature: 330 °C; injector temperature: 290 °C; oven temperature: from 200 °C (5 min) to 215 °C at 2 °C min−1 and then to 250 °C at 5 °C min−1."
9,Results and discussion,"Table 1 shows the results of the metal and B content as determined by ICP-OES and the results of specific surface area (BET) of the catalysts. The percentages of Rh and Sn are very close to those expected theoretically. It could thus be said that during the preparation process there were no losses of active material. The amount of B has a trend of decreasing concentration as the Sn content is increased, probably due to the greater blocking effect of the Rh particles by the Sn, leaving less amount of reducing agent on the catalyst and showing that only Rh can be reduced. On the other hand, it is observed that the specific surface was not affected by the loading of the metals because of the small amount of metals impregnated. Fig. 1 shows the TPR traces of the monometallic Rh and Sn catalysts and the bimetallic catalysts. The Sn monometallic catalyst has a wide reduction peak between 150 and 550 °C that is formed by two reduction zones in the 200–350 and 380–520 °C ranges. This is an indication of a heterogeneous interaction between Sn oxide and alumina. According to the literature [21,22] Sn4+ only reduces to Sn2+, due to their strong interaction with the support. The monometallic Rh catalyst shows a reduction peak at around 85 °C with a little shoulder at about 130 °C. The first peak could be attributed to the reduction of amorphous Rh2O3 and the shoulder would be related to the reduction of crystalline Rh2O3 [23]. In the case of bimetallic catalysts, the increase in Sn content slightly shifts the reduction peak attributed to reduction of rhodium oxides species to higher temperatures. An increase in the size of this peak is also observed, putting in evidence a co-reduction of Rh and Sn. Sn deposited on Rh particles blocks the hydrogen access to rhodium oxides or modifies the electronic structure of Rh and prevents its reduction. On the other hand, the reduction zone at 200–500 °C, attributed to the reduction of Sn, increases with the amount of tin. This reduction zone is shifted to lower reduction temperatures than on monometallic Sn catalyst. It can be concluded that part of the Sn is reduced at lower temperatures by the catalytic action of Rh as reported by other researchers [24,25]. CO chemisorption was used to obtain information about the dispersion of the Rh particles. Sn did not chemisorb CO and therefore only Rh superficial atoms were probed [26]. It can be seen in Table 1 that Rh dispersion decreases from 36 to 15% by the incorporation of 1 wt% Sn. Higher amounts of Sn led to 9–6% metal dispersion. As mentioned before Rh and Sn are in strong interaction and the catalytic properties of Rh are modified. Consequently the concentration of superficial Rh decreases (as determined by CO chemisorption) as the Sn content increases. Fig. 2 shows the conversion results obtained in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation and the cyclopentane hydrogenolysis reactions as a function of the percentage of Sn on the catalysts. Preliminary experiments showed that Sn is inactive in both reactions; therefore, the catalytic activity is only due to Rh species. Increasing the load of Sn produces a decrease in the activity of the metal function in both reactions, with a higher drop in activity in the case of hydrogenolysis. The loss of activity with the increase in Sn content is due to the strong interaction between Rh and Sn as found by TPR. Sn would modify Rh properties by a geometric or electronic effect. We have reported that the electronic effect influences more than the geometric effect in this type of catalysts [27]. The higher loss of activity of cyclopentane hydrogenolysis compared to dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is due to demanding nature of hydrogenolysis. Hydrogenolysis needs a special ensemble of surface metal atoms while hydrogenation is insensitive to the structure and proceeding even over single sites [28]. The turnover frequency of the cyclopentane reaction (molecules of cyclopentane converted per unit Rh superficial atom and second) decreases eight times from 0.83 s−1 to 0.10 s−1 in a similar way as Rh dispersion. On the other hand the turnover frequency of the cyclohexane reaction (molecules of cyclohexane converted per unit Rh superficial and second, results not shown) is less affected by Sn addition (except for the RhSn5 catalysts). These results show the importance of the type of Rh ensembles for each reaction as previously indicated. The electronic properties of the catalyst were studied by XPS. Rh 3d core level spectra of four representative catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The Rh 3d5/2 peak was deconvoluted into two peaks, one at 307.2 eV attributed to Rh0 [29,30] and a second one at 308.4 eV due to Rh3+ [31]. Ojeda et al. [32] found that not all Rh species are reduced to the metallic state after treatment with H2 at 500 °C for 1 h. Sn was not reduced to the metal state because no peak at 484.7 ± 0.2 eV corresponding to Sn0 was seen in the XPS spectra of the catalysts (not shown) [33]. Sexton et al. [34] did not find Sn0 species on Sn/γ-Al203 samples prepared by impregnation with different solution and reduced at 500 °C. This was attributed to a strong interaction of Sn oxides with alumina [35,36]. Table 2 shows the surface Rh/Al, Rh0/Rh and Sn/Al atomic ratios as determined by XPS and the bulk ratios as determined by ICP-OES. The Rh/Al (bulk) ratio varied between 0.0050 to 0.0057 due to the low difference of Rh content of the catalysts. XPS results show a surface enrichment of Rh in the monometallic and RhSn1 catalysts since the Rh/Al ratio obtained by this technique is greater than the bulk ratio. The addition of Sn promoter produces a linear decrease on the amount of superficial Rh and the fraction of Rh that is reduced to the metallic state. Sn is in strong interaction with Rh because it prevented Rh reduction as previously pointed out. The superficial Sn/Rh atomic ratios are higher to the bulk ones due to the greater superficial enrichment of Sn. These results correlate with the lower activity of bimetallic catalysts in the dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions (Fig. 3). Before the hydrogenation reaction tests of oleic acid some runs with different stirring rates were performed in order to assess the external mass transfer limitation effects. The Weisz-Prater criterion was also calculated to assess the influence of intraparticle mass diffusion problems as previously reported [12,13]. The Weisz-Prater modulus was 0.21 for the higher reaction rates showing the absence of internal diffusion problems. Moreover the reaction rate and the yield to different reaction product were independent of the stirring rate used thus prompting to a negligible influence of external mass transfer effects. It is worth noting that the reaction of transesterification between a fatty acid (oleic acid or stearyl acid) and an alcohol (oleyl alcohol or stearyl alcohol) leading to the formation of a wax ester took place during the hydrogenation reaction of oleic acid (results not shown). The presence of heavy esters has been reported by other researchers. These intermediate products are rapidly transformed into alcohols [5,6,37–39]. The highest yield of heavy esters was 8.3 and 4.6% on RhSn5 and RhSn4 catalysts, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the conversion values of oleic acid as a function of the reaction time for the different catalysts. The conversion increases with the reaction time as expected for a batch reactor. In all cases 100% conversion is achieved, although with the RhSn5 catalyst the rate of conversion was much slower. This is explained by considering that excess Sn inhibits the reaction by decreasing the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activity (Fig. 2). The other catalysts achieve maximum conversion before 90 min of reaction, the catalysts with lower Sn content being the most active. The yield to octadecane is shown in Fig. 5 . All catalysts produce undesired alkanes. Their formation increases with reaction time and decreases with the Sn content. These results correlate with those of the dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis tests that showed decreasing activities at increasing Sn contents. Figs. 6 and 7 show the yields to oleyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, respectively, as a function of reaction time. It is seen that the hydrogenation activity of the monometallic Rh catalyst is very high, leading to stearyl alcohol (hydrogenation of CO and CC), while the highest yield to oleyl alcohol was obtained with the RhSn4 and RhSn5 bimetallic catalysts (85.5%). Pouilloux et al. [37] proposed that SnOx species interacting with the Ru atoms are involved in the selective hydrogenation reaction of oleic acid. Similarly, SnOx species in strong interaction with Rh could be the active sites for the selective hydrogenation of the CO group. With the increase in Sn content, the hydrogenation activity of Rh is limited, hydrogenation of the CC double bond being decreased. Higher amounts of SnOx species would be formed that could interact with Rh. The highest amount of oleyl alcohol was obtained with the RhSn4 and RhSn5 catalysts, which had a high amount of superficial SnOx species (see Table 2). Similarly, the yield to stearyl alcohol (Fig. 7) also has a maximum with reaction time. The maximum was obtained with the RhSn2 catalyst at 180 min reaction time. The presence of the maximum yield to oleyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol as a function of reaction time is explained considering that both alcohols are intermediate reaction products. At longer reaction time these intermediate products would be reacted to the saturated alkane. All catalysts produced stearic acid (Fig. 8 ). The maximum yield to stearic acid decreased as the Sn content increased. This maximum was produced at a low reaction time (<30 min). Hydrogenation of the double CC bond is catalyzed only by Rh because stearic acid formation decreases at higher Sn contents while hydrogenation of the CO group is produced on Rh-SnOx sites. It is important to point out that for each catalysts the maximum yield to stearic acid is produced before the maximum yield to oleyl alcohol and the maximum to stearyl alcohol is produced in the last place. Considering the time at which the maximum of each product appears it can be inferred that the hydrogenation reaction of oleic acid occurs in a stepwise fashion according to the reaction mechanism of Fig. 9 , octadecane (C18) being the final reaction product. Hydrogenation of the double CC bond is faster than the hydrogenation of the CO bond [40] because the activation energy of the CC bond hydrogenation reaction is lower than the activation energy for hydrogenating the CO group [12]. Moreover the heat of CC hydrogenation (˜125 kJoule mol−1) is greater than the average heat of hydrogenation of the CO group (˜62 kJoule mol−1) and therefore the hydrogenation of the CC bond is more thermodynamically favored [41]. A 94.4% yield to fatty alcohols (stearyl + oleyl alcohol) was obtained with RhSn4/ γ-Al2O3 at 5.07 MPa. This yield is higher than the yield reported by Huang et al. [42] for the hydrogenation of methyl laurate using Cu/ZnO at 21 MPa and also higher than the yield reported by Peng et al. [43] for hydrogenation of palm oil esters at 10 MPa hydrogen pressure with a Cu-Zn/Al2O3 catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"It was found that the addition of Sn modifies the catalytic properties of Rh. A change in the activity in the reactions of cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis was seen. TPR analysis showed an interaction between both metals while XPS characterization showed that Sn modified the amount of surface Rh species and their reducibility. Rhodium had high hydrogenation activity, saturating the CC double bond, reducing the CO group and forming octadecane. The addition of Sn limits the rate of Rh hydrogenation and creates Rh-SnOx species which are active sites for CO hydrogenation. The results of selective hydrogenation of oleic acid exhibit the maximum yield to oleyl alcohol (85.5%) on the RhSn4 and RhSn5 catalysts. The RhSn4 catalyst had a 94.4% yield to fatty alcohols (oleyl and stearyl alcohol)."
