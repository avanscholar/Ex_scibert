0,Introduction,"Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that have melting points below 100°C [1]. Those salts that are liquids at ambient temperature are correspondingly termed room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). These compounds typically possess high-thermal stabilities (over 300°C), negligible vapor pressure, and are highly tunable making them attractive solvent systems. The aforementioned properties allow for ILs to be especially useful in analytical chemistry, particularly in separation science. A number of recently published reviews nicely summarize the use of ILs in all aspects of analytical chemistry [2–9]. The solvation characteristics of ILs make them among the most useful but yet complex solvent systems. A number of different approaches have been exploited to study the solvation properties of ILs [10–17]. Some ILs are said to have polarities similar to those of short-chain alcohols [18], but it is also observed that simple functional group alterations to the cation or anion impart unique and complex solvation characteristics to the ILs [19]. The characterization of these properties is a means to a more fundamental understanding of these solvents that will lead to their effective use in a broad range of applications. The solvation parameter model [20], developed by Abraham and co-workers, has been used extensively to probe the solvation characteristics of a variety of gas chromatography (GC) stationary phases, including ILs [15,19]. This model is described by the following equation: (1) log k = c + l L + e E + s S + a A + b B According to Eq. (1), k is the chromatographic retention factor of a solute on a given stationary phase at a specific temperature. The solute descriptors (L, E, S, A, B) have been previously determined for a large set of solute molecules [20] and are undergoing constant refinement [21]. The solute descriptors are defined as E is the excess molar refraction, S is the solute dipolarity/polarizability index, A and B are the solute hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity, respectively, and L is the solute gas–liquid distribution coefficient on hexadecane at 298K. The coefficients of each solute descriptor (i.e., l, e, s, a and b) are referred to as the system constants and their values, which are temperature-dependent, provide a measure of the complementary interactions with the solute descriptors. Specifically, e provides a measure of the solute–stationary phase interactions via π–π and n–π interactions, s is a measure of stationary phase dipolarity, a provides a measure of hydrogen bond basicity, b is a measure of hydrogen bond acidity, and l describes overall dispersive-type interactions. Mixed stationary phases have been widely used in GC to provide unique selectivity that is not typically observed with neat stationary phases [22–24]. Poole et al. have employed the solvation parameter model to evaluate GC stationary phases based on poly(dimethylsiloxane)/poly(ethylene glycol) mixtures [22]. Schurig and co-workers have demonstrated the use of a binary chiral stationary phase (CSP) based on the attachment of l-valine diamide and permethylated β-cyclodextrin to a polysiloxane backbone [23]. The combined selectivity imparted by both chiral selectors expanded the types of analytes that could be resolved by the CSP. Boudah and co-workers demonstrated the use of liquid crystal mixtures in the isomeric separation of aromatic compounds, polyaromatic compounds, and phenols [24]. Based on the selectivity enhancements obtained with mixtures of traditional stationary phases, the possibility of accentuating distinct or multiple solvation interactions using mixtures of IL appears promising. It has been shown previously that imidazolium and pyrrolidinium-based ILs exhibit hydrogen bond basicity behavior that is strongly anion-dependent with dipolar interactions that are largely governed by the unique cation and anion combination [15]. IL-based stationary phases employing halide anions strongly retain analytes that possess hydrogen-bonding abilities (e.g., alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids) resulting in long retention times and usually peak asymmetry [25]. Conversely, under common separation conditions using ILs containing less hydrogen bond basic anions such as hexafluorophosphate and bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, poor separation selectivity results in severely overlapping peaks, particularly for alcohols and carboxylic acids. Given these shortcomings of neat IL-based stationary phases, the unique separation selectivity obtained by producing stationary phases of varied IL mixtures is a promising means to provide tunable, highly selective, and efficient separations. Up to this date, only one report has demonstrated the use of an inorganic salt eutectic in the separation of polyphenyls [26]. In this work, we choose two ILs, namely, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM-Cl) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide (BMIM-NTf2), that differ significantly in the hydrogen bond basicity of the paired anion and use their binary mixtures as GC stationary phases. The solvation interactions were examined at three temperatures using the solvation parameter model on six different stationary phase compositions. The IL mixtures were further examined by exploring the effect of the stationary phase composition on the retention, selectivity, and resolution of 14 analytes consisting primarily of alcohols and aromatic compounds."

3,Methods,"2.2 Methods The ILs used as stationary phases in this study were BMIM-Cl and BMIM-NTf2. These ILs were synthesized following the procedures described elsewhere [6]. Both ILs were characterized using 1H NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). BMIM-Cl (600MHz, [2H6]dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6)): δ (ppm) 9.33 (s, 1H), 7.82 (s, 1H), 7.75 (s, 1H), 4.18 (t, 2H, J =7.2MHz), 3.86 (s, 3H), 1.76 (m, 2H), 1.25 (m, 2H), 0.89 (t, 3H, J =7.2MHz). ESI-MS [BMIM+]: 139.3u. BMIM-NTf2 (600MHz, DMSO-d 6): δ (ppm) 9.13 (s, 1H), 7.79 (s, 1H),7.71 (s, 1H), 4.16 (t, 2H, J =7.2MHz), 3.84 (s, 3H), 1.74 (m, 2H), 1.24 (m, 2H), 0.90 (t, 3H, J =7.2MHz). ESI-MS [BMIM+]=139.3u; [NTf2 −]=280.0u. The structures and physicochemical properties of these ILs are shown in Table 1 . Five-meter capillary columns were coated by the static method with 0.45% (w/v) solution of the desired neat or mixed RTIL in methylene chloride at 40°C following the procedure described elsewhere [15,25]. All characterization and separation experiments were conducted using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The gas chromatograph is equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors coupled in series. Coated capillaries were conditioned overnight from 40°C to 100°C at 1°C/min using a constant flow of helium at a flow rate of 1.0mL/min. Column efficiency was tested with naphthalene at 100°C. All coated columns had efficiencies of 1400plates/m or better. To ensure that the coated layer did not change with time, the retention factors of selected analytes were recorded and monitored throughout the evaluation process. Probe molecules used for all GC experiments were dissolved in methylene chloride and injected separately at the respective temperature. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1mL/min. The inlet temperature was maintained at 250°C, while the coupled detectors were held at 250°C, the make-up flow of helium at 23mL/min, the hydrogen flow at 40mL/min and the air flow at 450mL/min. Agilent ChemStation software was used for data acquisition. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) and statistical calculations were performed using the program Analyze-It (Microsoft, USA). Void times (t m) were estimated by injection of methane using a gas-tight syringe. Retention factors were calculated according to the equation k =(t r − t m)/t m, selectivities (α) according to α = k 2/k 1 and the resolution factors (R s) according to R s =1.18 (t 2 − t 1)/(W (0.5)1 + W (0.5)2) where W (0.5)1 and W (0.5)2 are the peak widths at half height of the corresponding peaks."
4,Results and discussion,"The GC measurements obtained using the solvation parameter model were carried out by the careful selection of a pool of probe molecules containing different solute descriptors. Table 2 lists the 46 test solutes used to evaluate the solvation parameters of the prepared IL stationary phases. Some probe molecules with very low-boiling points (e.g. 1-chlorobutane, ethyl acetate) eluted near the solvent front at high temperatures whereas on some columns other probe molecules (especially carboxylic acids and alcohols) at low temperatures exhibited excessively long retention times or did not elute thereby decreasing the total number of probe molecules used in the evaluation. The retention factors of acetic and propanoic acids were well-predicted by the solvation parameter model up to stationary phase compositions of 50% (w/w) of BMIM-Cl."
5,Characterization of neat versus mixed ionic liquid stationary phases using the solvation parameter model,"3.1 Characterization of neat versus mixed ionic liquid stationary phases using the solvation parameter model It is well known that the BMIM-NTf2 IL exhibits a much higher thermal stability compared to the BMIM-Cl IL [25]. However, due to the high hydrogen bond basicity of the chloride anion, GC columns employing the BMIM-Cl IL stationary phase tenaciously retain analytes such as alcohols and carboxylic acids that are capable of undergoing hydrogen bonding [27]. Despite the fact that these two ILs have the same cation, the interaction capabilities imparted by the two different anions provide unique solvation properties that can be readily characterized by the solvation parameter model. To explore the effect of mixtures containing different compositions of the BMIM-NTf2 and BMIM-Cl ILs on the measured system constants, five IL mixtures containing different weight percentages of BMIM-Cl in BMIM-NTf2 (i.e., 10%, 25%, 40%, 50%, and 75%) were prepared. Both ILs appeared fully miscible with each other at all compositions and were easily dissolved in the dichloromethane coating solvent. The system constants for all IL mixtures were evaluated at three temperatures (40°C, 70°C, and 100°C) using the probe molecules shown in Table 2. Table 3 lists the system constants for each IL-based stationary phase at the respective temperature along with relevant statistical data obtained from multiple linear regression analysis. It is important to note that the system constants have not been corrected for interfacial adsorption. It has been reported previously by Poole and co-workers that in open tubular capillary columns solutes can undergo interfacial adsorption as a competing retention mechanism to partitioning, especially for solutes on highly cohesive stationary phases, low phase loadings, and under temperatures lower than 130°C [28]. Despite the fact that the system constants reported in Table 3 were not corrected for interfacial adsorption, thicker stationary phase films (0.28μm) were employed in this work to minimize interfacial adsorption from low phase loadings. Smooth decreases in the system constants with increasing temperature are obtained for most of the stationary phases reported in Table 3. The exceptions occur for those columns that were examined with higher concentrations of the BMIM-Cl IL (see 40% and 75% BMIM-Cl in Table 3) in which either the intercept (c-term), e system constant, and s system constants do not decrease with increasing temperature. Nevertheless, the integrity of the models is reinforced by the appropriate statistical indicators and is further supported by the fact that the trends in the data make chemical sense. The stationary phase mixtures shown in Table 3 are distinguished from each other largely by their strengths of dipolar and hydrogen bond basicity interactions. As expected, the moderate cohesive forces, characteristic of most ILs, are largely unchanged as the composition of the stationary phase is varied. A linear increase in the hydrogen bond basicity (a-term) is observed as the amount of the BMIM-Cl IL (specifically, the chloride anion) in the stationary phase increases. Fig. 1 illustrates the linearity of the hydrogen bond basicity obtained at 40°C, 70°C, and 100°C with correlation coefficients of 0.998, 0.916, and 0.968, respectively. The value of the hydrogen bond basicity is observed to increase by 316%, 298%, and 328% when comparing the neat BMIM-NTf2 IL column to that of the 75% by weight BMIM-Cl IL column at 40°C, 70°C, and 100°C, respectively. In addition, the difference in the value of the a-term between 100°C and 40°C for each column becomes larger as the stationary phase composition is enriched with chloride anion. The amount of chloride anion in the stationary phase is also observed to have an effect on dipole-type interactions. For example, the 25% BMIM-NTf2/75% BMIM-Cl column shows a 137% increase in dipolar interactions at 40°C compared to the neat BMIM-NTf2 IL column. As will be discussed in subsequent sections, the ability to tune the strength of dipolar and hydrogen bond basicity interactions allows for ultimate control over the retention, selectivity, and resolution of alcohols, amines, and aromatic compounds."
6,Effect of stationary phase composition on analyte retention,"3.2 Effect of stationary phase composition on analyte retention It has been observed previously that the retention of analytes on IL-based GC stationary phases is dependent on the structural make-up of the IL, most importantly the nature of the anion [15,25]. In all previous work, the employed stationary phases consisted of neat ILs. While columns possessing the neat BMIM-Cl IL stationary phase exhibit unique separation selectivity in the separation of some analytes, the limitations stemming from its lower thermal stability, tenacious retention of alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines, and the production of peaks possessing considerable asymmetry limit its use in widespread GC applications. As shown in Table 4 , variations of the retention factor are observed for all analytes as the composition of the stationary phase changes. Alcohols exhibited the most significant increase in retention on stationary phases possessing highest percentages of the BMIM-Cl IL. For example, the retention factors of 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, cyclohexanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol increased by 1100%, 992%, 913%, 767%, and 765%, respectively, on the 75% BMIM-Cl/25% BMIM-NTf2 column compared to the neat BMIM-NTf2 IL column. While the stationary phase composition has the greatest effect on the retention of alcohols, slight increases in the retention factor were observed for 1,2-dichlorobenzene, benzonitrile, and nitrobenzene. However, analytes containing ketone, aldehyde, or ether functional groups (e.g., octylaldehyde, ethyl phenyl ether, cyclohexanone, acetophenone) exhibited lower retention as the percentage of the BMIM-Cl IL was increased. While it is observed that slight changes to the IL stationary phase composition alter the retention factor for most analytes, the most significant result from Table 4 indicates that the retention characteristics can be effectively tuned to provide the selectivity and resolution required for accomplishing complex separations."
7,Effect of stationary phase composition on chromatographic selectivity,"3.3 Effect of stationary phase composition on chromatographic selectivity Alterations in the retention factor with slight composition changes of the stationary phase allow for increased control over the selectivity of various analytes, as shown in Fig. 2 . Chromatograms A–D in Fig. 2 illustrate the change in selectivity for the separation of 14 analytes on four 5-m capillary columns containing different IL compositions; namely, neat BMIM-NTf2, (75%/25%) BMIM-NTf2/BMIM-Cl, (50%/50%) BMIM-NTf2/BMIM-Cl, and (25%/75%) BMIM-NTf2/BMIM-Cl, respectively. The mixture of analytes possessed various functional groups including alcohols, substituted aromatic compounds, aldehydes, and ketones. The employed temperature program used for all columns was chosen by first optimizing the separation on the neat BMIM-NTf2 column. As shown in Fig. 2A, only four analytes (1-butanol, 1-octanol, benzonitrile, and 1-decanol) are baseline resolved whereas most other analytes are poorly resolved. When 25% by weight of the BMIM-Cl IL is added to the stationary phase, a dramatic change in the separation selectivity is observed for all compounds. All alcohols (peaks 1, 3, 5, 9, and 14) exhibit significant increases in retention times. Cyclohexanol and octylaldehyde (peaks 5 and 6) which are poorly resolved in Fig. 2A, exhibit exceptional resolution as the retention of octylaldeyde decreases and that of cyclohexanol increases. o-Xylene and 1-pentanol (peaks 2 and 3), which co-elute in Fig. 2A, become well resolved as the retention of 1-pentanol increases. As the amount of the BMIM-Cl IL is increased to 50% and 75% by weight (see Fig. 2C and D), all alcohols continue to exhibit longer retention times, with the smaller chained alcohols possessing larger shifts in retention times compared to larger alcohols. A comparison of Fig. 2A and D demonstrates that the addition of chloride anion to the stationary phase allows for the near baseline resolution of most compounds, with the exception of ethyl phenyl ether and cyclohexanone, in approximately 155min. The effect of the stationary phase composition on the separation selectivity of chosen analyte pairs at 70°C is shown in Table 5 . It can be seen that an increase in the content of the BMIM-Cl IL in the stationary phase has three effects on the resulting separation selectivity: an increase, decrease, or no change in the observed separation selectivity. For example, two pairs of analytes (1,2-dichlorobenzene/octylaldehyde and nitrobenzene/acetophenone) possess the same retention factors on the neat BMIM-NTf2 IL column (i.e., α equal to one) but exhibit an increase in their respective separation selectivities as the percentage of the BMIM-Cl IL increases. The selectivity between benzonitrile and 1-pentanol decreases from 10.0 on the neat BMIM-NTf2 IL column to 1.2 on the 75% by weight BMIM-Cl IL column. In the third case, the selectivities between most alcohols are observed to be largely unchanged with varying stationary phase composition. Many analytes, particularly alcohols, exhibit the propensity to undergo changes in the elution order as the hydrogen bond basicity of the stationary phase increases (see Fig. 2A and D). The ability to alter the elution order to the extent shown in this work is typically not possible using combinations of stationary phases employed in commercially available GC columns. To lower the separation time without sacrificing selectivity, the analyte mixture was subjected to separation on the 75% by weight BMIM-Cl IL column. Fig. 3 shows the resolution of all 14 analytes in approximately 84min using an optimized temperature program. By using a lower initial temperature and steeper ramp than was used to achieve the chromatograms from Fig. 2, peaks 7 and 8 were resolved with only a slight loss of resolution for peaks 5 and 11. The incorporation of the same stationary phase composition into a longer column would provide additional theoretical plates while still retaining the enhanced selectivity characteristics culminating shorter separation times."
8,Effect of stationary phase composition on chromatographic resolution,"3.4 Effect of stationary phase composition on chromatographic resolution As described in the previous sections, the IL mixture employed as the stationary phase clearly influences the retention behavior of most studied analytes. From the four chromatograms in Fig. 2, the resolution data for seven analyte pairs was calculated and is shown in Table 6 . In all cases where the resolution of aliphatic alcohols and aromatic compounds are compared, the resolution increases drastically and begins to plateau at high percentages of the BMIM-Cl IL component in the stationary phase. An enhancement in the resolution of aromatic solutes is also observed when examining the separation of acetophenone/naphthalene and nitrobenzene/naphthalene. In the former case, a resolution factor of 0.57 is observed on the neat BMIM-NTf2 IL column, but resolution is lost as the chloride content is increased to weight percentages of 25% and 50%. However, the resolution factor rebounds to 1.22 when the chloride content in the stationary phase is increased to 75% (w/w). While the enhanced hydrogen bond basicity increases the resolution of most aromatic/aromatic and aromatic/alcohol solute pairs, the data in Table 6 reveals that this is not true for all combinations. For example, in the case of the separation of nitrobenzene and cyclohexanol, a 74% loss in the resolution factor is observed when the chloride content of the stationary phase was increased to only 25% by weight. A complete loss of resolution was observed at 50% by weight of chloride ion in the stationary phase, but baseline resolution was later achieved when the chloride content was increased to 75% by weight. A reversal of elution order was achieved for these two analytes at higher BMIM-Cl compositions."
9,Conclusions,"ILs constitute a viable class of gas chromatographic stationary phases due to their high-thermal stabilities, multitude of simultaneous solvation interactions, and synthetic flexibility. However, the retention and selectivity of analytes is dependent on the structural make-up and composition of the IL-based stationary phase employed. For the first time, binary mixtures containing two ionic liquids with different anions were employed as gas chromatographic stationary phases. The enrichment of the IL-mixture with chloride anion results in a stationary phase with enhanced dipole-type and hydrogen bond basicity interactions. By tuning the composition of the stationary phase mixture, the separation selectivity of a mixture of alcohols and aromatic analytes were improved. Many analytes capable of undergoing hydrogen bonding exhibited reversal of elution order on stationary phases capable of extensive hydrogen bond basicity interactions. The results show that mixtures of ILs may be useful in accentuating specific solvation interactions that may be necessary to separate structurally similar molecules including homologs and isomers."
