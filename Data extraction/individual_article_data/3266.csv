0,Introduction,"It is widely anticipated that hydrogen could be the only viable long-term option for addressing many of our energy, environmental and economic concerns. It has opened up the possibilities to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and turn to a sustainable alternative. Hydrogen has not only the highest energy content per unit weight among the known gaseous fuels, but also has the clean combustion potential producing nothing worse than water vapor and heat energy [1]. Thus, in contrast to fossil fuels like coal and petroleum, hydrogen does not contribute to the greenhouse effect, depletion of the ozone layer and acid rain. Over 90% of the world's hydrogen of around 45 million metric tonnes is produced from fossil fuels [2]. Unfortunately, these processes are highly energy and capital intensive and not always environmentally benign. Biological hydrogen production, on the other hand, can take place under ambient temperature and pressure. Besides, with the present rate of consumption, the fossil fuel reserves of the world will be depleted in the coming years. Hence, production of biological hydrogen as an alternative fuel assumes paramount importance. Both basic and applied R&D activities on biological production of hydrogen have drawn significant attention over past few decades. Among various processes of biological hydrogen production fermentation has several advantages to its credit over the others [3]. Apart from its simple technology, it can utilize a wide range of substrates, both pure as well as waste products, and does not rely on the availability of light sources. Fermentative hydrogen production is a ubiquitous phenomenon under anoxic or anaerobic conditions. Here, pyruvate, the product of glucose catabolism, is oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which can be converted to acetyl phosphate and results in the generation of ATP and excretion of acetate. Pyruvate oxidation to acetyl-CoA requires ferredoxin (Fd) reduction. Reduced Fd is oxidized by hydrogenase, which generates Fd and releases electrons as molecular hydrogen [3]. Fermentative hydrogen production has been studied with a number of microorganisms using various substrates. In reviews by Das and Veziroglu [3], Kosaric and Lyng [4] and Nandi and Sengupta [5], extensive lists of heterotrophic bacteria known to produce hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation have been published. Among large number of microbial species, pure culture of Enterobacter, Bacillus and Clostridium are the efficient producers of hydrogen [5]. Apart from pure cultures, mixed microflora is also used for hydrogen production from carbohydrates [3]. Earlier work from this laboratory has reported the isolation and biochemical characterization of Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08, a facultative anaerobe that produces hydrogen at a high rate [6]. This was followed by several studies on different engineering aspects of hydrogen production characteristics of the same organism [7]. However, to understand the involvement of hydrogenase as well as its accessory gene sequence and the controlling elements involved in the process of hydrogen evolution isolation and characterization of hydrogenase gene of this bacterial strain at the molecular level is important [8]. In Enterobacter genus, till to date, there is no report of characterization of hydrogenase gene which is responsible either for hydrogen evolution or its uptake. Keeping this objective in mind [Fe]-hydrogenase encoding gene isolated from E. cloacae IIT BT-08 has been over-expressed in fast growing non-hydrogen producing Escherichia coli BL-21 using pGEX 4T-1 vector [9]. A gene of 444bp encoding for [Fe]-hydrogenase has been isolated, cloned and sequenced. The present study is in parallel with the previous one and aims at the amenability of the over-expressed strain towards production of hydrogen in a batch as well as in continuous system. Effect of several physico-chemical parameters has been investigated and compared with pertinent literature. Finally, the recombinant strain was compared with the wild strain E. cloacae IIT-BT-08 with respect to various growth parameters and hydrogen production characteristics."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and culture condition,"2.1 Microorganism and culture condition Bacterial strain, E. cloacae IIT-BT 08, isolated and characterized previously by Kumar and Das [6] was used in the present study. The strain was routinely maintained aerobically on nutrient agar medium at 37°C by monthly transfer. For genomic DNA isolation, the strain was grown aerobically at 37°C in Luria Bertani (L.B.) medium in an incubator shaker at 250rpm until the cell grew to mid-log phase. Isolation, characterization and over-expression of Fe-hydrogenase coded gene from E. cloacae IIT-BT-08 by using pGEX 4T-1 vector in non-hydrogen producing E. coli BL-21 was already reported by Mishra et al. [9]. Recombinant E. coli BL-21 thus obtained was used in the present studies. One hundred millimolar of IPTG was used as an inducer in both cell growth and hydrogen production medium."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure Batch cultivations were performed in shake flasks of 1000ml capacity at a temperature of 37°C and initial medium pH of 6.0. Ten percent (v/v) overnight seed culture of recombinant E. coli BL21 grown in L.B. broth was used as inoculum. After inoculation, the flask was flushed with pure argon gas (99.99%) for a period of 5min to ensure anaerobic condition. The medium was agitated at a speed of 100revmin−1 with the help of a magnetic stirrer. Unless stated otherwise, the duration of batch fermentation was 48h. For continuous system, an immobilized whole cell tubular bioreactor of total working volume 480ml, packed with coconut coir (a lignocellulosic material as support matrix), was employed. The schematic representation of experimental set-up is depicted in Fig. 1 . The pre-treatment of the solid matrix was done according to the method reported by Ghosh and Bandopadhyay [10]. The culture broth was centrifuged at 8000rpm for 15min and harvested cells were suspended in 0.1M phosphate buffer solution of pH 6.0. A concentrated cell suspension, containing 35gl−1 of cells suspended in 0.1M phosphate buffer of pH 6.0±0.2, was passed through the packed column at a flow rate of 50mlh−1 with the help of a peristaltic pump for 8h. Thereafter, the reactor was kept at rest for 12h. MYG medium, containing 1% (w/v) malt extract, 0.4% (w/v) yeast extract and varying concentrations of glucose (0.2–1.4%, w/v) were prepared and pH was adjusted to 6.0. The sterilized media were stored in a separate reservoir and passed through the biomass-loaded column at different dilution rates. While switching from one dilution rate to another, the reactor was started afresh with MYG media. The dilution rate was estimated by dividing the feed flow rate with the working volume of the bioreactor. Anaerobicity was maintained by flushing the reactor with pure argon gas (99.99%) for a period of 5min. The effluent from the reactor was collected separately for estimation of unconverted glucose and residual biomass concentration. The gas mixture consisting of argon, carbon dioxide and hydrogen was channeled through an absorber containing 30% (w/v) KOH solution for selective absorption of carbon dioxide. The spent medium (effluent) from the reactor was collected in a separate reservoir and was analyzed periodically for finding out the concentration of unconverted glucose and biomass. An outlet of gas from the headspace of the spent-medium reservoir was also connected with the main gas recovery line from the reactor."
4,Methods of analysis,"2.3 Methods of analysis The composition of the gas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using 80/100 Porapak-Q (3.2mm diameter×2m length) column. The oven, injector and detector temperatures were 80, 150 and 200°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20mlmin−1 and at pressure of 80psi. Estimation of hydrogen was done using Turbochrom chromatographic software (Perkin-Elmer LLC, USA). Biomass concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer (Model: Novaspec) at a wavelength of 660nm. Reducing sugar (glucose) content of the medium was also estimated spectrophotometrically (Model Novaspec, wave length=540nm) using dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent [11]."
5,Reproducibility and statistical analysis,2.4 Reproducibility and statistical analysis All the results presented in this work are the average of a minimum of duplicate experiments. Variation estimates between two different sets of experimental data points were carried out using the data analysis and technical graphics software Microcal Origin 5.0. The error bars in the respective figures were estimated on the basis of calculation of standard deviation and standard errors using statistical analysis tool box of the same software.
6,Results and discussions,
7,Growth characteristics and kinetic constants,"3.1 Growth characteristics and kinetic constants Studies were conducted to find out the suitability of Monod equation for biomass growth kinetics during the growth of recombinant E. coli BL21 in a batch system for fermentative hydrogen production. The values of specific growth rate (μ max) and saturation constant (K S) following Monod model were estimated by regression analysis of Lineweaver–Burk linearized equation. The values of maximum specific growth rate (μ max) and saturation constant (K S) were 0.4h−1 and 11.11gl−1, respectively, using glucose as substrate. These values are found different from those reported for the wild strain E. cloacae IIT-BT-08, where the values of μ max and K S were 0.568h−1 and 3.658gl−1, respectively. The maximum specific growth rate is temperature and pH dependent [12]. Although temperature was kept constant during growth experiment, pH was not controlled. This might have resulted in the difference of μ max value. The kinetic constants obtained from this work can be used as design parameters for hydrogen producing bioprocesses with a variety of reactor configuration. For instance, as the K S value (11.11gl−1) represents the substrate concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximum growth rate, it could become a guideline for adjusting the most efficient substrate concentration in the feed [13]."
8,Effect of inoculum size,"3.2 Effect of inoculum size In order to determine the optimum inoculum size, for maximum rate of hydrogen production various inoculum sizes of 2.5, 5, 10 and 15% (v/v) were used to inoculate different batches. The effect of inoculum size on hydrogen production and also on the final concentration of biomass by recombinant E. coli BL-21 is presented in Table 1 . The hydrogen production rate increased from 0.719mmolh−1 at 2.5% to 0.96mmolh−1 with a 5.0% (v/v) inoculum. Maximum cumulative volume of hydrogen production was also obtained with inoculum size of 5% (v/v). Lowest biomass concentration was observed with 2.5% (v/v) of inoculum size, whereas the highest concentration was observed at 15% (v/v) of inoculum size. Moreover, with high inoculum size (15%, v/v), there was marginal reduction of the fermentation time to reach the maximum biomass concentration. It is worthwhile to note that since the duration of fermentation batch was 40h and it was not allowed to prolong further, the increase in biomass concentration could not be observed. Probably, this suggests that with prolonged duration of batch, concentration of biomass would have been further increased even with lower inoculum sizes. There was no significant difference in hydrogen production rate for inoculum sizes of 10 and 15% (v/v). The results indicate that there was no clear correlation between the inoculum size and the rate of hydrogen production, although the highest production rate was obtained with 5% (v/v) inoculum size. Hydrogen evolution by recombinant E. coli BL 21 is primarily a growth-associated process and hence it is expected that the highest rates of hydrogen evolution could be attained during the growth phase. This implies that high substrate to biomass ratio would prolong the growth phase and facilitate higher hydrogen production rate [14]. This, however, disagrees with the findings of Lay [15], which showed that a low substrate (cellulose) to cell density facilitated high hydrogen generation by a mixed hydrogen producing culture."
9,Effect of initial pH,"3.3 Effect of initial pH The effect of initial pH of the medium on hydrogen production was investigated by varying the pre-sterilization pH between 5 and 7 keeping the other operative conditions (temperature=37°C, substrate concentration 1.0%, w/v) constant. As shown in Fig. 2 . increasing the pH at the interval of 0.5 resulted in an increase in cumulative volume of hydrogen production up to pH 6 and thereafter the production dropped. The poor hydrogen production at low pH, lower than 5.5, could be due to the increased formation of acidic or alcoholic metabolites, which destroys the cell's ability to maintain internal pH [16]. It might have resulted in lowering of intracellular level of ATP, thereby inhibiting glucose uptake. The optimum pH of 6.0 for maximum yield of hydrogen observed in this study is also in good agreement with the reported values of similar studies of pH 6.2 using glucose and a mixed culture [17], pH 5.5–6.0 using sucrose and a heat treated inoculum [18] and pH 6–7 using molasses and a mixed culture [19]. However, Tanisho et al. [20] reported that pH 6.5 was most suitable for the evolution of hydrogen by Enterobacter aerogenes strain E-82005. The yield of hydrogen varied from 1.0 to 1.1molH2/(molglucose) in the pH range from 5.5 to 6.5. The results indicate that the optimum pH for maximizing the rate of hydrogen production is dependent both on the type of microorganisms and the substrates used. Moreover, it is difficult to draw a satisfactory correlation between the initial medium pH and the cumulative hydrogen production or its yield by extension as the case may be, since the experiments were carried out in uncontrolled pH conditions. This difference in behavior with respect to the initial medium pH for hydrogen production characteristics may be a very interesting fact for considering the mechanism of fermentative hydrogen production."
10,Effect of initial substrate concentration,"3.4 Effect of initial substrate concentration Unlike other H2-forming species, such as green algae, production of hydrogen in anaerobic fermentation is accompanied by the breakdown of organic substrate, here glucose. So, the initial glucose concentration plays an important role in the overall production of hydrogen during the course of fermentation. To investigate the effect of initial substrate concentration on the cumulative volume of hydrogen produced various concentrations (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4%, w/v) of glucose were used as substrate in the MYG media. During the experiment, initial pH of the medium was 6.0 and fermentation temperature was kept constant at 37°C. Effect of various initial concentration of glucose on the overall yield of hydrogen is depicted in Fig. 3 . It reveals that yield of hydrogen production reached its maximum with 1% (w/v) of initial glucose concentration compared to the other higher concentrations. It has already been reported that substrate inhibition gets predominant at higher glucose concentration because this modifies the metabolic pathways [17,21]. The lower H2 yield indicates that the carbon flux at high glucose concentrations is more directed to the production of reduced by-products such as ethanol and/or organic acids [22]. Since alcohol production involves the consumption of hydrogen in the form of reducing equivalents such as NADH, it is inevitable that fermentation conditions that favor the metabolism of sugar to alcohols reduce hydrogen production. Wu and Lin [19] observed a similar trend between the substrate concentration and the hydrogen production rate in which the highest yield was found at 4% (w/v) of molasses concentration using a mixed culture. This trend, however, was different from the studies of Zhang et al. [23] and Lay [15], where a steady decrease in hydrogen yield was reported with increasing substrate concentration for starch in starch wastewater."
11,Effect of temperature,"3.5 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the volumetric hydrogen production was studied at temperatures varying from 25 to 45°C. During these experiments, initial pH of the fermentation medium (MYG) and initial glucose concentration were kept at 6.0±0.2 and 1% (w/v), respectively. The effect of temperature of fermentation medium on the cumulative volume of hydrogen production is depicted in Fig. 4 . It was observed that volume of hydrogen production increased with an increase in temperature and 37°C was found most favorable for maximum volumetric hydrogen production. However, a further increase of temperature resulted in subsequent reduction of hydrogen production. These results agree well with the studies conducted by Yokoi et al. and Tanisho et al. [24,20]. The decrease in the volumetric production of hydrogen at higher temperature may be attributed to an increase in denaturation rate of the enzymes [21]. In fermentation or enzymatic processes, it is known that the positive kinetic effect of an increase of temperature prevails over the negative effect on the biocatalyst activity up to the threshold temperature beyond which thermal deactivation of biocatalyst takes place. Thermal deactivation at higher temperatures leads to inactivation of the enzymes responsible for controlling metabolic pathways in the fermentative hydrogen production process [25]."
12,Effect of dilution rate in the continuous system,"3.6 Effect of dilution rate in the continuous system The rate of hydrogen production and consumption of glucose by recombinant E. coli BL 21 at different dilution rates in the continuous system are depicted in Table 2 . In order to maintain a steady state, the bioreactor was operated at least for two days at each dilution rate until steady-state condition was achieved. This was confirmed at each dilution rate by constant value of hydrogen evolution rate, residual glucose concentration and biomass concentration in the effluent. Hydrogen production rate was found to reach maximum [66mmolH2/(lh)] when MYG media were supplied at a dilution rate of 0.55h−1 but the production rate came down with further increase in dilution rate. Consumption of substrate (glucose) was found to decrease with increase in dilution rate and the maximum utilization was about 70% at a dilution rate of 0.25h−1 (Table 2). This may be due to the fact that at higher dilution rate (flow rate), the chances of excess cell population in the reactor are minimal and this leads to reduced substrate utilization. But the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient increases with increasing dilution rate in a packed bed reactor with immobilized cells [7]. Therefore, the immobilized cells get access to more and more substrates per unit time resulting in higher gas production rate. However, gas hold-up remains a major problem in tubular bioreactor and this reduces the working volume of the reactor and also the efficiency of the process [7]."
13,Suitability of molasses as substrate,"3.7 Suitability of molasses as substrate Carbohydrates including glucose and sucrose are the preferred substrates for anaerobic fermentation but the high cost of these pure substrates poses limitation for the process to be commercially competitive. Therefore, in search of low cost substrates, various waste materials and/or industrial by-products containing sugary or starchy carbonaceous compounds are extensively used. Black strap molasses, a by-product of cane sugar industry containing about 51% of sucrose, could be a potential substrate for hydrogen fermentation [26]. In the present work, cane molasses, procured from the local market, has been used as substrate for fermentative hydrogen production by recombinant E. coli BL-21 in a continuous process. One percent (w/v) of molasses was replaced with glucose in the MYG media keeping the other constituents same. Hydrogen production rate at various dilution rates are given in Table 3 . Maximum rate of hydrogen production obtained using molasses was 97.4mmol/(lh) at a dilution rate of 0.375h−1. This is quite higher than the maximum rate of hydrogen production (36mmolH2/(lcultureh), reported by Tanisho and Ishiwata [26] in 300ml fermentor with diluted molasses (containing about 2% sugar) in a continuous system using E. aerogenes E-82005. Tanisho and Ishiwata [27] also reported continuous hydrogen production from molasses by E. aerogenes E-82005. The process gave a maximum of 2.2molH2 /(molsugar), estimated in terms of sucrose. In another study by Wu and Lin [19], molasses wastewater has been used for hydrogen production by mixed microflora. The maximum hydrogen productivity (HP) and hydrogen production rate (HPR) reached 47.1mmolH2/(gCODre) and 97.5mmolH2/(lday), respectively, at a substrate concentration of 40gCOD/l and pH 6.0 [19]."
14,Energy analysis,"3.8 Energy analysis The yield of hydrogen from glucose using recombinant E. coli BL21 was 3.14mol/(mol glucose). Assuming overall efficiency of fuel cell as 80% [28], Gibbs free energy of hydrogen as 56.7kcalmol−1, the lower heating values of hydrogen and glucose as 58.3 and 686kcalmol−1, respectively, the gaseous energy recovery from the substrate can be estimated as: Energy recovery from substrate = lower heating value of H 2 × yield of H 2 lower heating value of glucose = ( 58.3 ) ( 3.14 ) 686 × 100 = 26.68 % 0 , 1 Final conversion efficiency = Gibbs free energy for H 2 × yield of H 2 × overall efficiency of fuel cell lower heating value of glucose = ( 56.7 ) ( 3.14 ) ( 0.8 ) 686 = 21.34 % The percentage of gaseous energy recovery obtained in this study using recombinant E. coli BL 21 was slightly lower than that obtained by the wild strain E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 (energy recovery 28.34%) [6]; however, in the latter case, sucrose was used as substrate."
15,Comparative hydrogen production characteristics of the wild and the recombinant strain,"3.9 Comparative hydrogen production characteristics of the wild and the recombinant strain The recombinant E. coli BL-21 strain was compared with that of the wild strain E. cloacae IIT-BT-08 with respect to their growth characteristics as well as hydrogen production potentials in batch and continuous operation (Table 4 ). In spite of their identical fermentation patterns in utilizing glucose (data not shown) and few other similar physico-chemical parameters of fermentation, they differ significantly in their kinetic parameters and overall yield of hydrogen. Optimum initial pH, initial glucose concentration and reaction temperature for fermentative hydrogen production are almost comparable and/or marginally same for both the strain. However, the yield of hydrogen (molH2/(molglucose)) with the recombinant E. coli BL 21 is 3.12molH2/(molglucose) which is much higher than that reported for E. cloacae IIT-BT-08. This clearly exemplifies the success of the genetic manipulation in the improvement of overall yield of hydrogen, which constitutes the major motivation of the present study. However, the rate of hydrogen production in the continuous system could not be obtained higher than that reported for the wild strain. This might be due to the partial wash out of the entrapped cells. There was also the problem of gas hold-up with the tubular bioreactor, which could have been mitigated by changing the reactor configuration [7]. On the other hand, repeated recycling of the spent medium to the reactor ensures higher utilization of the substrate; thereby, overall yield of hydrogen could enhance as well. The requirement of lower optimum dilution rate for the recombinant strain as compared to the wild strain can be attributed to their kinetic behavior. Probably, this might be due to the fact that hydrogen is growth-associated product and the maximum specific growth rate of the recombinant cells has been found lower than that of the wild strain. The results also suggest that high yield of hydrogen does not necessarily translate into a high production rate [14]. These results are higher than the respective yields of 0.98mol/(molglucose) [17] and 1.8mol/(molsucrose) [29] obtained for a mixed microbial culture, which indicated that mixed microbial cultures did not produce hydrogen with any greater efficiency than pure cultures."
16,Conclusion,This study demonstrated the fermentative biohydrogen production by hydA over-expressed recombinant gene (present in E. cloacae IIT BT 08) in non-hydrogen producing E. coli BL-21 in a batch as well as in continuous system. The maximal hydrogen yield was estimated to be 3.12molH2/(molglucose) which is much higher than the wild strain E. cloacae IIT-BT-08. This clearly underscores the effectiveness of over-expression of hydA gene towards improvement of hydrogen productivity. The maximum rate of hydrogen production was found to be 66mmol/(lh) in the continuous immobilized whole cell bioreactor at a dilution rate of 0.55h−1 using 1% (w/v) glucose as the substrate in MYG media. Initial medium pH of 6.0±0.2 and reaction temperature of 37°C were established to be the most favorable for maximum rate of hydrogen production. The results showed that impure sugar feedstock such as black strap molasses could potentially serve as substrates for hydrogen fermentation effectively. The results of this study could be applied to the development of a high rate continuous hydrogen production process.
