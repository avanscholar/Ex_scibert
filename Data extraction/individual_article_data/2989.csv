0,Introduction,"Allyl alcohol is an intermediate in medicines, pesticides and fragrances, and its main derivatives are also used in the synthesis of 1,4-butanediol and 3-bromopropene, as well as the production of plasticizers and engineering plastics [1–3]. During the production of epichlorohydrin by the propyl acetate method, an aqueous solution of allyl alcohol can be obtained [4]. Since allyl alcohol can form an azeotrope with water, it is difficult to separate allyl alcohol from its aqueous solution by conventional distillation. Usually, for separation of the azeotropic mixtures, some special distillation technologies are required [5], such as azeotropic distillation [6,7], extractive distillation [8,9] and pressure-swing distillation [10–12]. In recent years, ionic liquids (ILs) are applied in the separation of azeotropes due to its unique thermophysical properties compared to the conventional solvents. Pereiro et al. [13] separated the azeotropic systems water + alcohols/tetrahydrofuran and aromatic + aliphatic hydrocarbons with ILs. Tsanas et al. [14] reported the separation of the system ethanol and water with ILs as entrainers. Oliveira et al. [15] separate the azeotropic mixture n-heptane + ethanol with ILs. Compared to ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents (DESs)have the advantages of biodegradability, less toxicity, and are easy to be synthesized [16–19]. Until now, DESs have been used in various fields of separation [20–22]. In this work, the DESs were adopted to separate the mixture of allyl alcohol and water. Meanwhile, the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data [23–26] are required for the systems (allyl alcohol + water + DESs) to design and optimize the separation process. Up to now, some researchers have reported vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the system of allyl alcohol + water. Grabner et al. [27] and Zhang et al. [28] determined isobratic VLE data for allyl alcohol + water at 101.3 kPa. Harper et al. [29] determine isobaric VLE data for allyl alcohol + water at 100.26 kPa. Aucejo et al. [30] measured isobaric VLE data for allyl alcohol + water at pressures of 30, 60 and 100 kPa. Xu et al. [31] reported the effect of salts on the equilibrium VLE of azeotrope allyl alcohol + water. By retrieving the NIST database, there is no isobaric VLE data reported for the system (allyl alcohol + water + DESs). In this work, two DESs choline chloride: glycerin (ChCl: Gly) and choline chloride: urea (ChCl: Ur) with the molar ratio of 1:1 and 1:2 were adopted for separation of the azeotropic mixture of allyl alcohol and water, and the isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the systems (allyl alcohol + water + DESs) were determined at 101.3 kPa. The charge density distribution over the molecular surface was calculated by the COSMO model for allyl alcohol, water and DESs to analyze the interactions between the different species. Meanwhile, the thermodynamic consistency of the VLE data were checked by the van Ness test. The VLE data were correlated by the nonrandom two-liquid model (NRTL)."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemical,"2.1 Chemical The chemicals allyl alcohol, choline chloride, glycerin and urea were analytical grade and purchased commercially. Choline chloride and urea were dried before used under vacuum drying oven and the other chemicals were used directly. The purities of allyl alcohol and glycerin were checked and confirmed by gas chromatography (GC) (Rui Hong SP6890). The deionized water was used in this work which was made in our lab by an ultra-pure water machine (Chengdu Down's Corning Technology Development Co., Ltd.). The conductivity of deionized water is <1.0 μS·cm−1. The information of the chemicals is listed in Table 1 ."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure The DESs were prepared using the method described by Abbott et al. [32]. To prepare the DESs, choline chloride and urea were dried in a vacuum drying oven at 313.15 K for at least two days before it was used. Then, choline chloride and glycerin with the molar ratio of 1:1 and choline chloride and urea with the molar ratio of 1:2 were mixed in two round bottom flasks in an argon protective glove box. The mixtures were stirred at 348.15 K until a clear liquid appeared. After that, the content of water in the DESs were measured by automatic Karl Fischer moisture analyzer (756 KF Coulometer, Metrohm China Co., Ltd.), which was <1000 ppm. The vapor-liquid equilibrium data was determined using a modified Rose type recirculating equilibrium still [31], which has been presented in detail by Huang et al. [33]. The test sample was prepared by the gravimetric method. The accuracy of the electronic analytical balance (SL512N, Mettler Toledo Instrument Co., Ltd) was ±0.0001 g. Approximately, the sample with a volume of 50 ml was placed in the equilibrium still and heated to boiling for about 60–90 min. When the temperature was kept for constant, the system was regarded in equilibrium. Then, the samples were withdrawn from the vapor phase and liquid phase by syringe for analysis. The experiment pressure was measured by a manometer (Hengyuan Automatic Gauge Co., Ltd.), and the pressure fluctuation was controlled within ±1 kPa with the two-step automatic control scheme. Meanwhile, a mercury thermometer was used to measure the equilibrium temperature with the accuracy of ±0.1 K."
4,Analysis test,"2.3 Analysis test The compositions of the samples from the vapor and liquid phases were determined by GC (Rui Hong SP6890), which were equipped with a packed column (Porapak Q 3 mm × 2 m, Dalian Sanjie Scientific Development Co., Ltd.) and a thermal conductivity detector TCD (Rui Hong Chemical Co., Ltd). For sample analysis, to prevent the DESs entering the GC column, a pre-column was installed before the GC column. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas with the purity of 99.999% and its flow rate was 50 ml/min. The oven temperature was 423.15 K. The injection temperature was set at 443.15 K. And the temperature of TCD detector was held at 443.15 K. Before analyzing the samples, the peak areas of GC were calibrated by four different standard samples that covered the whole composition range, which were prepared by the gravimetric method. Each sample was analyzed three times. The mean value was adopted when the deviation was not >0.001. Before and after vacuum drying, the DESs mass fraction of the samples was determined by the gravimetric method. The uncertainty of mole fraction is 0.006."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Validation of the apparatus,"3.1 Validation of the apparatus To verify the reliability of the experimental apparatus, the isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium data for the binary system allyl alcohol-water at pressure of 101.3 kPa were determined. The results are listed in Table 2 and Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1, the measured VLE data show consistent with the literature data [27,28], which indicates that the VLE measurement apparatus was reliable."
7,VLE data for the system allyl alcohol + water + DESs,"3.2 VLE data for the system allyl alcohol + water + DESs The isobaric VLE data for the systems of allyl alcohol + water + ChCl:Gly and allyl alcohol + water + ChCl:Ur were determined at 101.3 kPa by keeping the mass fractions of DESs nearly constant at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. The measured VLE data are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . The x-y diagrams for the systems are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the azeotropic point of the mixture allyl alcohol and water moves to upper-right corner until disappeared by adding the different amount of the DESs. The relative volatility of the separated component is a key factor in the rectification operating conditions. Higher volatility implies less investment and lower energy consumption. The relative volatility α 12 of allyl alcohol (1) to water (2) is calculated as follows: (1) α 12 = y 1 / x 1 y 2 / x 2 where x (DES-free) and y are mole fractions of component in the liquid phase and vapor phase, respectively. The values of the relative volatility α12 are listed in Table 3 and Table 4. The x-α diagrams for the binary system allyl alcohol + water with different DES are presented in Figs. 4 and 5 . As shown in Figs. 4–5, as increasing the content of DES in the mixture, the values of the relative volatility α 12 of allyl alcohol (1) to water (2) increases, which indicates that adding the amount of DES can affect the relative volatility effectively. Compared to DES ChCl:Ur, ChCl:Gly has higher effect on the VLE of the system allyl alcohol and water."
8,σ-Profiles analysis,"3.3 σ-Profiles analysis To explore the effect of the DESs on the separation of allyl alcohol and water, the charge density distribution over the molecular surface (σ-profiles) for the DESs were calculated by the COSMO model and are plotted in Fig. 6 . For comparison, the σ-profiles of water and allyl alcohol are also presented in Fig. 6. The detailed calculation of the COSMO model can be found in the previous publications [34,35] and in our previous work [36,37]. As shown in Fig. 6, two vertical dashed lines are the cutoff values for the hydrogen bond donor (σ < −0.0084 e·Å−2) and acceptor (σ > 0.0084 e·Å−2). If the profile lies in the left side of −0.0084 e·Å−2, the surface segment has the hydrogen bond donator ability. Conversely, the surface segment has the hydrogen bond acceptor ability if it lies in the right side of 0.0084 e·Å−2. Also, the further the peak of the profile is away from the absolute value 0.0084 e·Å−2 on the left or the right, the stronger the hydrogen bond donator or acceptor ability is, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the DESs have peaks in the region of σ > 0.0084 e·Å−2, which indicates that these DESs have the ability in accepting hydrogen bonds. Thus, the DESs are the hydrogen bond acceptors. In the meantime, water has a very broad σ-profile with two pronounced peaks around −0.016 e·Å−2 and +0.015 e·Å−2, which reflects its excellent ability as a donor as well as an acceptor for hydrogen-bond. The symmetrical shape of water σ-profile indicates a favorable interaction between water and itself, which can explain its high boiling points and surface tension. Similar to water, allyl alcohol also has a symmetrical shape. But in the area σ < −0.0084 e·Å−2, the σ-profile of allyl alcohol is wider than water. Therefore, allyl alcohol has a stronger hydrogen donor capacity. The σ-profiles of the DESs ChCl:Gly and ChCl:Ur extend away from the vertical line of 0.0084 e·Å−2, which indicates that the DESs have the strong hydrogen bond acceptor ability. Therefore, the difference between the interactions of DESs and water and those of the DESs and allyl alcohol can change the relative volatility of allyl alcohol to water, which leads to the elimination of the azeotropic point. The calculation results show the consistency with the experimental results that DESs ChCl:Gly and ChCl:Ur have the effect to destroy the azeotropic point of the system allyl alcohol + water."
9,Thermodynamic consistency test,"3.4 Thermodynamic consistency test To confirm the quality of the measured VLE data, the thermodynamic consistency for all the experimental data was checked by the van Ness test. The van Ness test is presented as follows: (2) Δ y = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N Δ y i = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N 100 y i cal − y i exp where N is the number of the experimental data; y i cal stands for the mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase calculated by the NRTL model; y i exp stands for the experimental mole fraction of component i in the vapor phase. If Δy is <1, the measured VLE data can be considered as thermodynamically consistent. With the van Ness test, the values of Δy are 0.3160, 0.3155 and 0.3660 for the system of allyl alcohol + water + ChCl:Gly at the DES concentrations of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 (mass fraction). And the values of Δy are 0.2810, 0.3491, 0.4050 for the system of allyl alcohol + water + ChCl:Ur at the DES concentrations of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 (mass fraction). All the values of Δy are <1, which indicates that the measured VLE data are thermodynamic consistency."
10,Correlation of the VLE data,"3.5 Correlation of the VLE data The vapor-liquid phase equilibrium can be expressed as follows: (3) y i ϕ ^ i v P = x i γ i ϕ i s P i s exp V i L P − P i s RT where the Poynting factor exp[V i L (P − P i s )/RT], ϕ ^ i v and ϕ i s associated with nonideality are all close to 1, since the pressure is low, x i and y i represent the mole fractions of component i in the liquid phase and vapor phase, respectively, P i s is the saturation vapor pressure of pure component i, which can be estimated by the extended Antoine expression [38]. Considering the non-ideality of the liquid phase, Eq. (1) can be simplified as: (4) y i P = x i γ i P i s The saturation vapor pressure of pure component was calculated by the extended Antoine equation, which is given as: (5) ln P i s / kPa = C 1 i + C 2 i T + C 3 i + C 4 i T + C 5 i ln T + C 6 i T C 7 i for C 8 i ≤ T ≤ C 9 i where C 1i to C 7i are the parameters for each component i, C 8i and C 9i are the limits of the temperature range, which were obtained directly from the Aspen databank [39] and are listed in Table 5 . Since the NRTL model is usually adopted to correlate the VLE data for the systems contained DESs [40], thus, in this work, the NRTL model was applied to correlate the measured VLE data for the systems allyl alcohol + water + DES (ChCl:Gly) and allyl alcohol + water + DES (ChCl:Ur). The parameters of the NRTL model were regressed from the VLE data by minimizing the following objective function: (6) F = ∑ i = 1 N γ 1 cal − γ 1 exp i 2 + γ 2 cal − γ 2 exp i 2 where γ i cal and γ i exp are the calculated and experimental activity coefficient of component i. The correlated results are plotted in Figs. 2–3 and the regressed parameters are listed in Table 6 . Also, the VLE data for the systems allyl alcohol (1) + water (2) + DESs (3) were predicted by the COSMO-RS model and compared with the experimental values. For clarify, the predicted results are presented in Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary materials. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for the temperature (T) and the mole fraction of the vapor phase (y 1) are expressed as follows: (7) RMSD T i = ∑ i = 1 N T i cal − T i exp 2 / N 0.5 (8) RMSD y i = ∑ i = 1 N y i cal − y i exp 2 / N 0.5 The values of RMSD (y 1) and RMSD (T) are listed in Table 7 , which are <0.003 and 0.26 K, respectively. To ensure the regressed parameters are coherent with the experimental VLE data, the tool Graphical User Interface (GUI-MATLAB) developed by Reyes-Labarta [41] was employed to check the parameters. The validated results showed that the fitted parameters of the NRTL model were coherent with the experimental data. The validated results for the NRTL model are presented Figs. S3 and S4 in the Supplementary materials."
11,Conclusion,"For separation of the azeotrope allyl alcohol and water, the DESs choline chloride: glycerin (mole ratio of 1:1) and choline chloride: urea (mole ratio of 1:2) were selected as the azeotropic point breakers. The isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium data for the system of allyl alcohol + water + DESs were determined to validate the selected DESs' performance for the separation of allyl alcohol from its aqueous solution. The measured VLE data showed that the azeotropic point of allyl alcohol and water were eliminated by adding the DESs choline chloride: glycerin (mole ratio of 1:1) at concentration of 10 wt% and choline chloride: urea (mole ratio of 1:2) at concentration of 15 wt%. Meanwhile, to analyze the interactions between the different species, the charge density distribution over the molecular surface was calculated by the COSMO model for allyl alcohol, water and DESs. At last, the measured VLE data were correlated by the NRTL model, and the correlated results agreed well with the experimental VLE data."
