0,Introduction,"Many attempts have been to use hydrogen as an alternative and renewable energy carrier to meet future demands because of its versatility and environmentally friendly properties [1–3]. Furthermore, the generation of hydrogen by splitting water, methanol, or ethanol using a photocatalyst has attracted considerable attention, and of the potential high energy density liquid fuels, methanol is the preferred raw material for hydrogen generation. Methanol can be converted to hydrogen in several ways, such as, by methanol steam reforming [4,5], by partial oxidation [6,7], decomposition [8], or by photocatalytic oxidation [9–14]. In particular, photocatalytic hydrogen production based on the decomposition of aqueous alcohol and carboxylic acid solutions appear to be practical, low-cost technologies [9–14]. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a powerful photocatalyst because it is highly photoactive, inexpensive, non-toxic, chemically stable, and environmentally friendly. However, it is activated only by UV because of its large energy band gap (3.2 eV for anatase TiO2). To improve the utilization of solar energy, much research effort has gone into shifting the photocatalytic hydrogen producing activity of TiO2 into the visible (l > 400 nm, which accounts for ∼42% of solar energy) [15–17]. In recent years, research on metal sulfide photocatalysts has progressed from the investigative [18–20] to the application stage [21–23], and their narrow band gaps allow absorption at longer wavelengths than TiO2. In fact, several studies have reported better photocatalytic activities for M(metal)2S3-doped TiO2 with respect to the photodegradation of organic pollutants than pure TiO2 photocatalytic systems [24]. In a previous study [25,26], we also found that hydrogen production from a methanol/water system was higher over ZnS or CdS doped TiO2. In this study, pyrite particles, FeS2 were synthesized using a solvothermal method using sodium thiosulfate as a sulfur source and loaded on nano-sized TiO2 in four weight ratios (3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt-%). Iron disulfide (FeS2) is used as a semiconductor material in solar cells because its absorption coefficient is much higher than that of silicon and it has an energy band gap (E g = 0.95 eV) comparable with that of silicon [27,28], and because it is nontoxic, readily available, and cheap. In the present study, the relationship between the spectroscopic properties of FeS2/TiO2 composite particles and their abilities to produce H2 were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), field emission scattering electron microscopy (FESEM), UV–visible spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry (CV)."
1,Experimental,
2,"The synthesis of TiO2, FeS2, and FeS2/TiO2 composite","2.1 The synthesis of TiO2, FeS2, and FeS2/TiO2 composite FeS2 was prepared using a common solvothermal method. To prepare the sol mixture, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3, 99.9%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) and iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99.9%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) were used as the S and Fe sources. Sodium thiosulfate (1.0 mol) was dissolved in absolute ethanol, 1.0 mol of iron chloride hexahydrate was then added slowly, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solution obtained was then transferred to an autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h under nitrogen. Pyrite is the common stable product of many anaerobic geochemical processes. Actually, geochemical pyritization requires the microbial reduction of sulfate to sulfide, oxidation of sulfide to disulfide, and an iron (either Fe2+ or Fe3+) source. When FeCl3·6H2O is used as a Fe source, the overall reaction can be described as: 2 Na 2 S 2 O 3 + 2 CH 3 CH 2 OH → 2 NaOH + 2 S 2 O 3 2 − + CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 , 2 S 2 O 3 2 − → S 2 − + 2 SO 3 + FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O → FeS 2 + 2 H 2 SO 4 + 3 HCl + 4 H 2 O + H + ( pH = 5 ∼ 6 ) . The resulting powder was washed with distilled water and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h FeS2 powder was then added (at 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, or 15.0 wt-%) to a suspension of nano-sized TiO2 powder (synthesized using a solvothermal method as described in our previous paper [29]) in ethanol. The slurries were then milled until the solvent had evaporated, and the powder obtained was heated at 300 °C for 3 h under nitrogen to obtain the FeS2/TiO2 composites."
3,"Characteristics of the synthesized TiO2, FeS2, and FeS2/TiO2 composite","2.2 Characteristics of the synthesized TiO2, FeS2, and FeS2/TiO2 composite Synthesized FeS2 and TiO2 powders and FeS2/TiO2 composites were examined by X-ray diffraction (MPD, PANalytical) using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (30 kV, 30 mA). Samples were scanned at 2θ angles ranging from 20 to 80° at a scan speed of 10° min−1 using a time constant of 1 s. The sizes and shapes of particles were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) on a SEM-S-4100/EDS-EX-2500 operated at 200 kV. UV–visible spectra were obtained using a Cary 500 spectrometer and a reflectance sphere. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results were obtained using a BAS 100B unit at room temperature and a scan rate of 100 mV/s using 0.1 M KCl as the supporting electrolyte, platinum wires served as working and counter electrodes, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode."
4,"Hydrogen production from aqueous methanol using the TiO2, FeS2, or FeS2/TiO2 composite","2.3 Hydrogen production from aqueous methanol using the TiO2, FeS2, or FeS2/TiO2 composite The photo splitting of aqueous methanol (methanol/water (1:1 vol/vol)) was carried out using a 2-L Pyrex photoreactor designed in our laboratory [21]. To split water, 0.5 g of powdered FeS2, TiO2, or FeS2/TiO2 composite was added to 1.0-L of distilled water in the reactor. UV-lamps (6 × 3 W cm−2, 30 cm long × 2.0 cm diameter; Shinan, Korea) emitting radiation at 365 nm were used. Aqueous methanol photo-splitting was conducted over 10 h with constant stirring. Hydrogen evolution was measured after 1 h, and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, model DS 6200; Donam Instruments Inc., Gyeonngi-do, Korea) equipped with a TCD (thermal conductivity detector). The following GC conditions were used: Carbosphere column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA), injection temperature 413 K, initial column temperature 393 K, final temperature 393 K, and detector temperature 423 K."

6,"Physical properties of TiO2, FeS2, and of the FeS2/TiO2 composite","3.1 Physical properties of TiO2, FeS2, and of the FeS2/TiO2 composite Fig. 1 shows the crystallinity determined by XRD of the FeS2/TiO2 composite, FeS2, and TiO2. All peaks, except those of pure TiO2, were indexed to cubic phase FeS2. XRD patterns of FeS2 showed main peaks at 28.51, 33.04, 37.07, 40.76, 47.42, 50.49, 56.27, 59.01, 61.68, 64.28, 76.59, and 78.96°, which were assigned to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (222), (023), (321), (231), (331), and (420) planes, respectively. Iron-pyrite has the prototypic pyrite structure. From the perspective of classical inorganic chemistry, which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, iron pyrites is probably best described as FeS2. This formal approach recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite form S–S bonds. Pyrite has a simple cubic structure, and in fact, is one of the first crystal structures elucidated by X-ray diffraction [30,31]. This crystal structure belongs to crystallographic space group Pa3, and is denoted C2 in the Strukturbericht notation. The lattice constant of stoichiometric iron pyrite FeS2 is 541.87 pm. The unit cell is composed of a Fe face-centered cubic sublattice into which S ions are embedded. In a previous study, we used solvothermally synthesized TiO2 as a shell material [29], and assigned its 2θ peaks at 25.3, 38.0, 48.2, 54, 63, and 68° to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) planes of anatase, respectively. For FeS2/TiO2 composites, although there was little reduction in intensity, anatase peak positions were unchanged. Pyrite peaks were obvious on loading FeS2, indicating excellent FeS2/TiO2 dispersion. Generally, peak line broadening indicates smaller crystallites. Scherrer's equation [32], t = 0.9λ/βcos θ, where λ is the wavelength of incident X-rays, β is full width at half maximum (FWHM) height in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle, was used to estimate crystallite sizes. Peak line broadening is related to the sizes of hexagonal (anatase) and cube (pyrite) crystalline phases. When the FWHM of anatase (101) and pyrite (200) 2θ peaks were selected, calculated crystallite sizes were 5.63, 4.80, 5.67, 5.79, and 5.92 nm for pure TiO2, 3.0 wt-%, 5.0 wt-%, 10.0 wt-%, and 15.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2, respectively, and 23.08, 32.76, 23.08, 28.65, and 21.30 nm for 3.0 wt-%, 5.0 wt-%, 10.0 wt-%, and 15.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 and pure FeS2 respectively. Atomic compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Table 1 ), and revealed that Fe, Ti, O, and S were the only elementary components in the FeS2/TiO2 composites and an Fe:S atomic ratio or 34.13:65.87 in pure FeS2. The molar ratio of Fe to S in FeS2 obtained by EDS was almost stoichiometric at 1:2. EDS showed that the TiO2 produced had good crystallinity and an anatase structure with a Ti:O molar ratio of 51.34:48.66 (Table 1). In the case of FeS2/TiO2 composites, Fe:Ti atomic ratios were 0.61:30.75, 0.89:30.27, 1.75:26.50, and 2.26:27.64 at FeS2 loadings of 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt-%. Fig. 2 shows field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the FeS2, TiO2, and FeS2/TiO2 composites. FeS2 powder was composed of spherical agglomerates of grape-like particles of diameter 1.0 μm. FESEM showed that TiO2 was composed of 20–50 nm diameter particles, and that FeS2/TiO2 had a core–shell structure of micro and nano components, which concurred with SEM observations. The small-sized TiO2 nano-particles were interconnected by the larger sized FeS2 micro-surfaces. Fig. 3 shows the influence of pH on the median zeta-potentials of the FeS2, TiO2, and FeS2/TiO2 powders; particle sizes in water are summarized in the table below Fig. 3. The zeta-potentials of all powders in aqueous suspensions decreased significantly on increasing pH, and surface charges switched from positive in acidic solutions to negative in alkaline solutions. For the FeS2 and TiO2 powders and the 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 composites, isoelectric points were at pH values of 7.12, 8.07, 7.58, 7.30, 5.95, and 5.82. Surface charges showed the same tendency versus pH. In neutral solution, the absolute zeta-potential value of TiO2 was +18.00 mV, indicating that the TiO2 colloid was stable [33]. On the other hand, FeS2/TiO2 composites were rather unstable in neutral solution with a zeta-potential of +7 to −7 mV and an aggregated particle size of 2970–4255 nm. We believe that this was related to the presence of surface reactive sites on this negative charged material. The highest zeta-potential observed (−42 mV) was for the 5.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 composite at pH = 9. Based on these results, we supposed that the prepared FeS2/TiO2 composites would be more photo-active in alkaline solutions."
7,"Hydrogen productions in aqueous methanol solution by the TiO2, FeS2, and FeS2/TiO2","3.2 Hydrogen productions in aqueous methanol solution by the TiO2, FeS2, and FeS2/TiO2 Fig. 4 summarizes the evolutions of H2 due to methanol/water splitting by FeS2, TiO2, or FeS2/TiO2 in a batch-type liquid photo system. Only a small amount of H2 (2.0 mmol) was collected from pure FeS2 and TiO2 over 10 h, whereas a significant amount of H2 was collected when FeS2/TiO2 was used and it reached to 9.80 mmol when 0.5 g of 10.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 was used. This was probably because when TiO2 absorbs light, electrons are excited from its conduction band into its valence band, and then fall into the conduction band of FeS2. Thus, electrons–hole recombination in TiO2 is suppressed and eventually photocatalytic activity increases. However, the amount of H2 produced was lower for FeS2/TiO2 composites at 15.0 wt-% than at a 10.0 wt-% FeS2 loading. We believe this occurs because if the amount of FeS2 is too great the number of electrons entering the TiO2 conduction band is reduced, and excited electrons in FeS2 recombine with holes, and thus, reduce catalytic activity. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance for methanol/water splitting over FeS2/TiO2 composites was enhanced in the presence of electrolytes (alkaline or acidic solutions at 1.0 mol). Hydrogen production dramatically increased in alkaline solution (particularly in KOH solution) and reached 11.2 mmol after 10 h, but was decreased in acidic solution (Fig. 4B). This result could be related to suspension stability as indicated by zeta-potential results (Fig. 3). In alkaline solution, many OH− ions are present, and when they encounter a positive hole, they become OH radicals, which have substantial photocatalytic activity. Ionic chromatography showed that CO 3 2 − ions were usually generated during methanol/water splitting, and amount of CO 3 2 − in solution were found to increase with catalytic activity and reaction time."
8,Relationship between photocatalytic performance and the optical properties of FeS2/TiO2 composites,"3.3 Relationship between photocatalytic performance and the optical properties of FeS2/TiO2 composites Fig. 5 shows the UV–visible spectra of TiO2 and FeS2/TiO2 powders. The hexagonal symmetric absorption of Ti4+ appeared at its usual location (350–380 nm) for pure TiO2. In this figure, the absorption band of FeS2 is omitted because it absorbed at all wavelengths in UV–visible region. In the spectra of FeS2/TiO2 composites (Fig. 5A), absorption bands were similar to those of pure TiO2. Generally, the band gap in a semiconductor material is closely related to absorbed wavelength, that is, the band gap decreases with increasing absorption wavelength. Consequently, materials with a narrow band gap can readily be utilized for visible light, whereas materials with a smaller band gap (<3.0 eV) exhibit poor photoactivity due to an elevated electron/hole recombination rate. The maximum absorptions of FeS2/TiO2 composites were slightly shifted to longer wavelength than those of pure TiO2. The tail broadening of peak suggested the presence of a sulfur component. To evaluate band gap energies, the UV spectra of TiO2 powder and FeS2/TiO2 composites were plotted versus Tauc [34] (Fig. 5B). In the UV–visible spectrum and in the Tauc plot of FeS2/TiO2 composites, absorption bands resembled those of pure TiO2. Band gaps for TiO2, and 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 composites obtained by extrapolation at the meeting point of the two tangents were ∼3.10, 3.00, 2.94, 2.89, and 2.84 eV respectively. The red colored FeS2 with a band gap of 0.95 eV absorbs across the entire visible region. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results shown in Fig. 6 are highly dependent on the analytic conditions used, and a semiconductor has to be redox active within the experimental potential window. In this study, potentials were measured in distilled water using a pelletized sample as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and 0.1 M KCl as the supporting electrolyte. It is desirable to display a reversible wave, which gives the following information: reversible reactions display a hysteresis of absolute potential between the reduction (E pc) and oxidation (E pa) peaks. Reversible reactions show ratios of peak voltages under reduction and oxidation conditions that are near unity (1 = E pa/E pc). When such reversible peaks are observed thermodynamic information in the form of half-cell potentials, E 1/2 0 (E pc + E pa/2) can be determined [35]. In particular, when waves are semi-reversible, such as, when E pa/E pc is < or >1, it is possible to determine more information about the kinetic processes. Some researchers [36] have reported a useful equation, which can determine the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) using CV. First, ferrocene (E 1/2 vs Ag/Ag+ = +0.42 eV) potential (a standard) should be measured in electrolyte solution using the same reference electrode, and −4.8 eV fixed as an energy level. Finally, HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be calculated using the following formula: HOMO(or LUMO)(eV)＝−4.8 − (E onset − E 1/2(Ferrocene)). Here, E onset is a starting point of the redox potential, and is used more than peak potential values. The onset potentials for reduction with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode for TiO2, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 composites, and FeS2 were 1.75, 0.85, 0.95, 1.55, 1.35, and 1.30 V respectively, and calculated LUMO energy levels were located at −0.66, −0.57, −0.58, −0.64, −0.62, and −0.61 eV respectively. This result was attributed to the fact that TiO2 electrons in valence bands absorb solar radiation and are excited to the conduction band. These excited electrons then move in conduction bands to FeS2. FeS2/TiO2 has more oxidation–reduction behavior than pure TiO2 or FeS2. Therefore, the relaxations of excited electrons are difficult and this reduces hole/electron recombination. The results of CV curve and UV–visible spectra analyses support Fig. 7 . The band gap of the FeS2/TiO2 composite was narrower than that of pure TiO2, and potential positions mean that valence and conduction bands were at lower energy levels than those of TiO2. This result means that electrons from the valence band during photocatalysis were easily transferred to conduction bands. Consequently, photocatalytic activity was enhanced for FeS2/TiO2 composites, with rapid initial emission. Generally when band gaps are narrow, electrons are easily excited by visible light, typically catalysts can represent excellent active. In particular, the initial activities of catalysts are increased, however recombination between electrons and holes, which are related to the degradation of catalytic performance, also occur easily. In the present study, the core/shell structured FeS2/TiO2 composites displayed small band gaps. However, their core/shell structures did not mean binding between their lattices. Actually two potentials in CV were observed but were difficult to distinguish. One probably was about the perfect linkage between shell TiO2 and core FeS2, and the other is that FeS2 was simply covered by TiO2. However, we selected the former which seems to be smaller band gap. However, there are more independent TiO2 and FeS2 particles than core/shell structured FeS2/TiO2 composites. This is explained by a model based on a FeS2 and TiO2 core/shell structure, the first electronic transition occurs in the TiO2 semiconductor, and then electrons in the TiO2 conduction band move into the FeS2 conduction band, whereas the hole in FeS2 moves to the valence band of TiO2, which is formed by the current recycle. Therefore, the recombination of excited electrons and holes will be suppressed during photocatalysis. These phenomena consequently increase the evolution of OH radicals formed from electrons and holes, and the rates of degradation of methanol and water will eventually enhance photocatalytic performance."
9,Conclusions,"FeS2 was synthesized using a solvothermal method using sodium thiosulfate, and then loaded at four different weight ratios onto nanometer sized TiO2. SEM showed that the FeS2 particles appeared as grape-like spheres of diameter 1.0 μm, and that the FeS2/TiO2 composites displayed a core (1.0 μm)/shell (20–50 nm) structure. UV–visible spectra and CV results revealed that band gaps in pure TiO2 and 10.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 were ∼0.46 and ∼0.52 V, respectively, and LUMO energy levels were calculated as −0.56 and −0.62 eV, respectively. A significant amount of H2 gas was collected over FeS2/TiO2 composites, the amounts collected peaked at 9.8 mmol over 10 h for 10.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2. We attributed this higher catalytic performance of the 10.0 wt-% FeS2/TiO2 composite to easier excitation at lower energy and slower electron–hole recombination."
