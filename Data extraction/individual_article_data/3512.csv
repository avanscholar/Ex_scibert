0,Introduction,"Many products today are dependent on polymers, which have multiple applications in fields such as packaging, bottles, clothing, and medicine (Zhu et al., 2016). Currently, worldwide plastic production exceeds 290 million tons/year, and is produced almost entirely from petroleum-derived feedstock, causing significant adverse effects on the environment, such as emissions of CO2 (Watts et al., 2015). The utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable source is therefore an important alternative for the sustainable production of fuels, chemicals, and polymers (Choi et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a; Won and Maravelias, 2017). The US Department of Energy reported value-added chemicals that can be produced from biomass, including succinic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, glucaric acid, levulinic acid (LA), and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) (Werpy and Petersen, 2004). Among these candidates, FDCA has attracted significant attention owing to the potential to substitute for conventional petroleum-derived terephthalic acid (TPA) used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Artz and Palkovits, 2018; Chang et al., 2019; Kabir et al., 2020; Sajid et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). FDCA can be used to produce polyethylene furanoate (PEF), fully bio-based alternative to PET, via copolymerization with ethylene glycol (Sheldon, 2018; Yu et al., 2013). PEF has enhanced barrier properties and improved mechanical properties (Burgess et al., 2014, 2015; Sajid et al., 2018). Moreover, infrastructure for the production of PET can be used for the production of PEF due to compatibility between the PET and PEF manufacturing processes (Zhu et al., 2016). Despite these advantages of PEF, the commercial production of PEF has been limited, mainly attributed to difficulties in the commercial production of FDCA. Consequently, producing FDCA on a commercial scale is inevitable for the commercialization of PEF. Effective biomass fractionation technology is crucial for the utilization of major biomass components (cellulose and hemicellulose), where lignin is typically used for a heating energy source (Won et al., 2017). However, biomass fractionation has been hampered by the robust and complex structure of biomass (Motagamwala et al., 2016). Recently, Alonso et al. (2017) suggested an effective biomass fractionation technology using a mixture of gamma-valerolactone (GVL) and H2O as solvent with dilute H2SO4 as a catalyst. They showed that cellulose and hemicellulose could be separated into nearly pure components which could be further upgraded to value-added chemicals. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is a versatile building block, is converted from cellulose or C6 sugars (fructose and glucose) (Babaei et al., 2018; Krishna et al., 2018). Cellulose, accounting for the largest proportion of biomass (40–50%), is readily available and less expensive than fructose or glucose, thereby a promising feedstock for producing HMF (Alonso et al., 2010). Recently, He et al. (2017a) showed that cellulose could be directly dehydrated to HMF using a polar aprotic solvent (tetrahydrofuran (THF) and H2O) containing H2SO4. It was observed that THF and H2O (90:10 mass ratio) as a polar aprotic solvent resulted in the highest HMF yield compared to other polar aprotic solvents (e.g., GVL, 1,4-dioxane, and diglyme) in the presence of a H2SO4 catalyst. HMF is typically used for the FDCA synthesis via catalytic oxidation on a 1) homogeneous catalyst (Saha et al., 2012) or 2) stoichiometric oxidant (Van Putten et al., 2013). The former method, however, has shortcomings of difficult catalyst reuse and environmental burden due to toxicity. The latter has the problem of using expensive oxidants and handling of significant waste. Motagamwala et al. (2018) reported that FDCA could be obtained from HMF via oxidation using GVL and H2O solvent over a Pt/C catalyst. They demonstrated that complete conversion of HMF to FDCA is achieved without the use of homogeneous catalysts (e.g., H2SO4). Hemicellulose-derived C5 sugar can produce tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), which is used for the production of 1,5-pentanediol as a polymer precursor (Wang et al., 2018). THFA is a value-added chemical with a market price of $3000/ton and has global consumption of over 85,000 ton/year (Krishna et al., 2018). THFA has not only attractive chemical properties including high solvency in both organic and inorganic components, thermal and chemical stability, and biodegradability, but also large applications in agriculture, printing ink, and cleaning products (Mariscal et al., 2016; Krishna et al., 2018). Recently, He et al. (2017b) showed that THFA could be obtained from furfural via hydrogenation over Ni/TiO2 catalyst in the gas phase. THFA is co-produced to improve the economics of the FDCA process in this study. Although experimental results of each reaction have been reported, an integrated process has not yet been developed. A key novelty of this study is the development of a new process that produces FDCA, THFA, and activated carbon together by combining catalytic conversion subsystems with separation subsystems for solvent recovery and final product purification, to improve the economics and maximize the profitability of the FDCA process. In order to examine the impact of the additional production of THFA on the economics, the proposed process is compared to a process that does not co-produce THFA. In addition, uncertainty analysis is performed to quantify the risks inherent in the immature process with the Monte-Carlo simulation method. Finally, the sustainability of the proposed process is investigated in terms of climate change, fossil depletion, metal depletion, and photochemical oxidant formation via life-cycle assessment."
1,Technology overview,"In this study, the proposed process combines various catalytic conversion subsystems: 1) hydrolysis of biomass to its components, 2) dehydration of C5 sugars to furfural, 3) hydrogenation of furfural to THFA, 4) dehydration of cellulose to HMF, 5) oxidation of HMF to FDCA, and 6) hydrogenation of LA to GVL to satisfy the GVL requirements of each reaction. In addition, we design separation subsystems for recovering and recycling solvents (THF, GVL, and H2O) and purifying products (FDCA, THFA, and activated carbon). Table 1 summarizes the chemical reactions in the proposed process."
2,Pretreatment,"2.1 Pretreatment Lignocellulosic biomass is processed in a hydrolysis reactor using GVL and H2O solvent (70:30 mass ratio) including 0.1 M H2SO4 catalyst for 3 h under mild conditions (398 K and 3.4 atm), wherein biomass is separated into insoluble cellulose and soluble C5 sugars and lignin in the solvent. The pretreatment under mild conditions maintains the structure of lignin intact (Alonso et al., 2017). LA and formic acid (FA) are also generated at 0.8% yield over the reaction. Acetate is solubilized in GVL and H2O solvent and forms acetic acid (AA). Alonso et al. (2017) demonstrated that the use of GVL could lead to direct load of feedstock in the pretreatment reactor without additional size reduction and dry feedstock because GVL is miscible with water at any concentration. Importantly, the hydrogenation of biomass-derived LA can produce GVL, leading to eliminating additional GVL make-up and accumulation of LA in the process (Alonso et al., 2011)."
3,Conversion of C5 sugars to THFA,"2.2 Conversion of C5 sugars to THFA After the biomass is broken down to cellulose, C5 sugars, and lignin, C5 sugars dissolved in GVL and H2O solvent (80:20 mass ratio) can be converted to furfural (at 89.1% yield) via dehydration combined with the chloride ion effect (by adding a small amount of sodium chloride, Marcotullio et al., 2010) for 5 min at 498 K and 20.7 atm (Gürbüz et al., 2013; Mellmer et al., 2014). The remaining portion of 9.9% C5 sugars is degraded to humins used as a heating energy source in a heat and power generation subsystem. THFA can be obtained from furfural via hydrogenation at 85.5% yield in the gas phase over Ni/TiO2 catalyst at 433 K and 1 atm, where the remaining 10% of furfural is converted to furfuryl alcohol (FFA) (He et al., 2017b), which has to be removed to purify the product stream containing THFA."
4,Conversion of cellulose to FDCA,"2.3 Conversion of cellulose to FDCA The solid phase of cellulose can be directly converted to HMF (at 42% yield) using THF and H2O solvent (90:10 mass ratio) including 20 mM H2SO4 catalyst for 45 min at 483 K and 68 atm (He et al., 2017a). Cellulose can also be degraded to LA and FA (at 1.9% yield), furfural and formaldehyde (at 3.2% yield), levoglucosenone (at 2.0% yield), levoglucosan (at 0.1% yield), glucose (at 1% yield), and humins (49.8% yield), which can be further transformed to activated carbon in an adsorption bed using regeneration with O2 (Motagamwala et al., 2018). He et al. (2017a) revealed that 10% H2O in THF solvent led to the highest HMF yield compared with other concentrations of H2O. In turn, HMF can be converted to FDCA (at 93.6% yield) via oxidation using GVL and H2O solvent (50:50 mass ratio) over Pt/C catalyst at 383 K and 40 atm. HMF and furfural (which is converted from cellulose) are also transformed to polymer at 6.3% and 100% yield, respectively, which can be further transformed into activated carbon and sold as an individual product (Motagamwala et al., 2018). Motagamwala et al. (2018) demonstrated that FDCA has high solubility in GVL and H2O solvent (50:50 mass ratio), which leads to oxidation of HMF to FDCA at high concentration over a heterogeneous catalyst, without any catalyst deactivation resulting from deposition of FDCA."
5,Separation subsystem,"2.4 Separation subsystem Cellulose (solid phase) and C5 sugars and lignin (liquid phase) can be separated using a filter. The C5 sugars carried along with the cellulose can be recovered using a filter by washing with recycled GVL. The GVL carried over cellulose can be separated using an evaporator. The purified cellulose can be utilized for upgrading to FDCA. Following the conversion of C5 sugars to furfural, the GVL and H2O used as a solvent should be separated to purify furfural for the following catalytic conversion (hydrogenation of furfural to THFA), where GVL can be separated using a distillation column. Furfural, which forms an azeotrope with H2O, can be separated using several distillation columns integrated with a decanter, following an industrial method (Zeitsch, 2000). Acetate-derived AA can be separated using a distillation column and sent to wastewater treatment. FFA, which is converted from furfural, should be separated from THFA for producing high-purity THFA and this can be done using a distillation column. THF and H2O used as a solvent in the conversion of cellulose to HMF has to be separated from the product stream containing HMF for its reuse in the cellulose to HMF conversion reactor. Although a large amount of THF is required owing to low cellulose loading (3% loading in solvent) and it should be separated for its reuse, THF can be easily separated using a distillation column because of its low boiling point (339 K). FDCA solubilized in GVL and H2O solvent can be crystallized by cooling the stream to room temperature (298 K) and separation using a filter. The separated FDCA can be further purified in an additional filter by adding H2O. The generated excess over dehydration reaction (conversion of cellulose to HMF) can be removed using a distillation column. The GVL produced from LA should be recycled and reused for each reaction."
6,Process development,
7,Simulation and assumptions,"3.1 Simulation and assumptions We developed a process model using Aspen Plus based on the experimental data described in Section 2. The processing rate was assumed to be at 2000 dry-ton-biomass/day, which was proposed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) report (Davis et al., 2015; Humbird et al., 2011). The heat exchanger network was established between hot and cold process streams by pinch analysis (Ramapriya et al., 2018). All equipment costs for the subsystems (pretreatment, THFA production, HMF production, FDCA production, FDCA separation, solvent recovery, wastewater treatment, heat and power generation, storage, and utilities) were estimated using either Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (Park et al., 2019) or an exponential scaling expression proposed by the NREL report (Davis et al., 2015). All equipment costs and raw material costs were adjusted for a common base year at 2015 dollar values using the Plant Cost Index (from Chemical Engineering Magazine). We used the minimum selling price (MSP) of FDCA as a criterion for economic analysis, rendering net present value zero, which was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis (Davis et al., 2015). For practical implementation, it is necessary to verify the catalytic reactions at a commercial scale and to address stability issues caused by multiple recycle streams. To consider the uncertainties related to developing a new process, we assumed a higher discount rate of 20%, compared to the nth plant assumption with a discount rate of 10% (Davis et al., 2015). See Table A1 of Supplementary Material for detailed economic parameters and assumptions."
8,Design,"3.2 Design The process for the production of FDCA, THFA, and activated carbon was developed from the above-mentioned technologies in Section 2. The entire process is composed of ten subsystems: 1) pretreatment, 2) THFA production, 3) HMF production, 4) FDCA production, 5) FDCA separation, 6) solvent recovery, 7) wastewater treatment, 8) heat and power generation, 9) storage, and 10) utilities. The process flow diagram for the proposed process is presented in Fig. 1 . Stream information is shown in Table B1 of Supplementary Material. In the pretreatment subsystem, biomass (stream 1) is directly fed to a fractionation reactor along with recycled GVL and H2O solvent (stream 5) and H2SO4 catalyst (stream 2). The product stream (stream 3) from the fractionation reactor containing cellulose, C5 sugars, and lignin is separated into cellulose (solid, stream 4) and C5 sugars and lignin (liquid, stream 10) via a filter. The C5 sugars carried over with cellulose in stream 4 are recovered via an additional filter by washing with recycled GVL (stream 9). The GVL conveyed with cellulose in stream 6 is recovered using an evaporator (stream 8). To satisfy the GVL requirement in the fractionation reactor, additional GVL is supplied (stream 65). The purified cellulose (stream 7) is sent to the HMF production subsystem for further production of FDCA. The C5 sugars (stream 10) are fed into the furfural reactor with a small amount of NaCl (stream 11), wherein the C5 sugars are converted to furfural via dehydration. For purification of furfural, the product stream (stream 12) is sent to a distillation column wherein GVL and other components (stream 14) are produced at the bottom of the distillation column and are sent to an evaporator. In this GVL recovery subsystem, GVL is produced from LA by hydrogenation in the GVL reactor and recycled back to the pretreatment subsystem via an evaporator, where heavy oil (stream 19) is injected to remove sticky humins on the wall. The biomass residues (lignin, humins, and FA) and other components (NaCl and H2SO4, stream 16) are filtered and sent to heat and power generation for generation of steam and electricity. The purified furfural (stream 22) is sent to a THFA reactor with H2 (stream 23) for the production of THFA. Following the production of THFA, the product stream containing THFA (stream 24) is purified using a distillation column and THFA is produced at the bottom of the distillation column with a purity of 98% (stream 26). The purified cellulose (stream 7) from the pretreatment subsystem is sent to the HMF reactor along with THF and H2O (stream 27 and stream 38) with H2SO4 catalyst (stream 29), where cellulose is converted to HMF via dehydration. The H2SO4 used as a catalyst is removed via neutralization with lime (stream 28) to prevent catalyst deactivation in the following catalytic conversion. The neutralized stream (stream 33) is sent to a distillation column for the separation of THF and H2O. Most of the THF (100%) and H2O (97.0%) from stream 33 is separated and produced at the top of the distillation column for recycling to the HMF reactor, where some portion of the impurities (mainly consisting of formaldehyde and THF) (stream 34) is purged and sent to heat and power generation. Significant heat energy is required in the HMF reactor due to the use of a large amount of solvent (to maintain the cellulose loading at 3%), which needs to be heated, leading to a requirement for outside energy (e.g., natural gas). Consequently, we introduce a compressor following the vapor stream (stream 36) at the top of the distillation column, where the vapor stream (stream 36) is compressed (stream 37) and then cooled down (stream 38); in this way, discharged heat can be used to cover some portion of the heating requirements of the HMF reactor. Following the separation of THF and H2O, the bottom stream (stream 39) containing HMF is mixed with recycled GVL and H2O (stream 63) and is routed to an adsorption bed for the humins adsorption on activated carbon. During the regeneration of the adsorption bed using O2 (stream 41), 57.2% of the carbon in the humins is converted to activated carbon (stream 42) and the remaining 42.8% of carbon is transformed to CO2 (stream 44). The HMF (stream 45) following the adsorption of humins is sent to the FDCA reactor with O2 (stream 46), wherein HMF is converted to FDCA via oxidation. FDCA (stream 47) dissolved in GVL and H2O solvent is cooled to 298 K (stream 48), leading to crystallization of FDCA which is separated via a filter (stream 50). The separated FDCA is routed to an additional filter for its purification. In the second filter, FDCA is purified up to 99.5% (stream 51) by adding H2O (stream 57) following the evaporation (stream 54) and cooling H2O (stream 55), and a portion of H2O (5%, stream 56) is sent to wastewater treatment to prevent accumulation of H2O. The produced GVL (stream 53) at the bottom of the evaporator is sent to GVL storage vessel in the solvent recovery subsystem. In the solvent recovery subsystem, the GVL and H2O (stream 49) conveyed from a filter are sent to a distillation column, where excess H2O generated from the dehydration reaction in the HMF reactor is removed and sent to wastewater treatment (stream 58). The bottom stream (stream 59) produced at the bottom of the distillation column is sent to the GVL reactor for the conversion of LA to GVL and it is collected at the GVL storage vessel. The collected GVL (stream 62) is recycled back to the pretreatment subsystem (98.0% GVL of stream 62) and HMF production subsystem (2.0% GVL of stream 62, due to adsorption of polymer) in order to satisfy GVL requirements."
9,Heat integration,"3.3 Heat integration The proposed process requires 456.2 MW of heat energy when 2000 dry-ton-biomass/day are processed. The major reason for this large heating requirement is the energy requirement of the HMF reactor (247.3 MW, 54.2% of total heating requirement). The sum of the energy contents of the biomass residues and biogas (produced from wastewater treatment) is estimated to be 176.1 MW and this would only be able to generate 125.0 MW of energy assuming a 71% boiler efficiency (Kim et al., 2020). To meet the remaining 331.2 MW energy requirement, a large amount of heating energy fuel (e.g., natural gas) needs to be purchased, which leads to an increase in the total cost. To overcome this challenge, we conducted heat integration by introducing a heat pump (Lee et al., 2019), which elevates the outlet temperature of the cooler (stream 38 in Fig. 1), and discharged heat from the cooler could cover some portion of the energy requirement in the HMF reactor (Fig. 1). The heat pump combined with the distillation column, as in the proposed process, enables more efficient heat exchange because the reboiler of the distillation column requires considerable energy to boil a large amount of liquid (Kiss et al., 2012). The heat curves and utility requirements with and without the heat pump are shown in Fig. C1 and Table C1, respectively, in Supplementary Material. Through this heat integration, we can recover a large amount of energy (327.7 MW), leading to a large reduction of the utility cost, as shown in Fig. 2 . The four major heat loads are also presented in Fig. 2. 90.0 MW and 58.4 MW of heating requirement in the HMF production subsystem are covered by conveyed heat energy from the HMF production subsystem (at the outlet of the cooler, stream 38) and the THFA production subsystem (at the top of the distillation column, streams 13 and 25)."
10,Results,
11,Capital and operating cost,"4.1 Capital and operating cost The capital and operating costs are calculated based on the installed equipment costs and raw material costs, respectively. See Section D in Supplementary Material for details. To investigate the effect of byproduct on the process economics, we compare the proposed process (Strategy A) with an alternative strategy (Strategy B), where biomass is only converted to FDCA and activated carbon. See Fig. E1 in Supplementary Material for details. The calculated annualized capital and operating costs are shown in Fig. 3 . The total capital cost of Strategy A is calculated as $343.8 million, which is higher than that of Strategy B ($317.1 million) by $26.7 million mainly owing to the absence of capital cost for the THFA production subsystem. The HMF production subsystem occupies the largest proportion, owing to high costs for the dehydration reactor ($76.8 million) and compressor ($12.0 million) resulting from significant mass flow of solvent (1.1 million kg/h of THF and H2O) to regulate the 3% cellulose loading in the solvent. The capital cost of the pretreatment subsystem in Strategy B is slightly higher than that of Strategy A by $2.8 million mainly owing to additional distillation columns for the separation of GVL and H2O solvent to be reused in the fractionation reactor. The capital cost of Strategy B for heat and power generation is also higher than that of Strategy A by $2.1 million mainly owing to increased boiler and turbo-generator costs resulting from increased inlet flow of biomass residues and external fuel (e.g., natural gas). The total operating cost of Strategy A is calculated to be $157.5 million/year, which is higher than that of Strategy B ($145.7 million/year) by $11.8 million/year mainly owing to decreased H2 make-up cost resulting from the absence of a THFA production subsystem. In the THFA production subsystem, a large amount of H2 is required for the hydrogenation of furfural to THFA. In the operating cost of Strategy A, feedstock cost accounts for the largest proportion (47.3% of the total operating cost) owing to a large amount of biomass (2000 dry-ton-biomass/day) and the high cost (white birch, $125/ton). The operating cost of the pretreatment subsystem in Strategy A is higher than that of Strategy B by $1.0 million/year mainly owing to additional GVL make-up cost to satisfy GVL requirements. The capital and operating costs of the heat and power generation subsystem in Strategy A are lower than those in Strategy B despite the additional separation, due to higher temperature of cold streams (e.g., condenser of distillation column) and thus higher energy recovery by heat integration, compared to Strategy B (327.7 MW vs. 269.5 MW). The total costs (sum of total capital and operating costs) of Strategy A and Strategy B are calculated to be $308.5 million/year and $287.4 million/year, respectively."
12,Minimum selling price,"4.2 Minimum selling price The MSP of FDCA was determined using discounted cash flow analysis based on the capital and operating costs. See Table F1 in Supplementary Material. The MSP of FDCA for Strategies A and B were determined to be $1253/ton and $2199/ton, respectively as shown in Table 2 . Although the total cost of Strategy A is higher than that of Strategy B owing to the addition of a THFA production subsystem, the MSP of FDCA for Strategy A is lower than that of Strategy B. This means that the production of value-added chemical (THFA) from C5 sugars is a better option, in terms of the economics of the process, than utilizing C5 sugars as a heating energy source, even when considering the increase in total cost resulting from additional conversion steps and separation subsystems. We further investigated the cost contribution per process subsystem for Strategy A using the radial chart shown in Fig. 4 . The chart includes capital, operating, and total costs. Among the subsystems, the pretreatment subsystem is the largest cost contributor, contributing $1267/ton to the MSP of FDCA (40.1% of total cost). This is mainly due to the operating cost, especially feedstock cost ($82.1 million/year). It should be noted that we used expensive feedstock (white birch, $125/ton) to evaluate the economics of the proposed process conservatively. The next largest cost contributor is the HMF production subsystem, contributing $755/ton to the MSP of FDCA (23.9% of total cost), which is mainly attributed to the expense of the cellulose dehydration reactor ($76.8 million) because of the large volume of solvent required (THF and H2O, 1.2 million kg/h). The heat and power generation subsystem also has an influence on the MSP of FDCA, contributing $563/ton (17.8% of total cost). This is attributed to the expense of the boiler and turbo-generator ($82.1 million) resulting from a large inlet flow of biomass residue and natural gas. On the other hand, the remaining subsystems (FDCA separation, solvent recovery, THFA production, storage, and utilities subsystems) do not have a significant impact on the MSP (less than 6% each). Taken together, the MPS of FDCA was determined to be $1253/ton, which is lower than the current petroleum-based TPA price ($1445/ton), indicating that there is sufficient potential to replace petroleum-based TPA with biomass-based FDCA. Moreover, through the cost contribution analysis, we identified the most significant cost contributors, such as the pretreatment subsystem."
13,Sensitivity analyses,"4.3 Sensitivity analyses We investigated the effect of plant capacity on the MSP of FDCA to identify the optimal plant capacity, estimating the MSP for five different capacities (500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 dry-ton-biomass/day) based on Strategy A. To this end, we generated simulation models for the five different capacities and evaluated the economics. Fig. 5 presents the contribution of the feedstock cost, capital cost, and return on investment (ROI) to the MSP. We observed that the feedstock cost increases as the plant capacity increases, owing to an increase in transportation cost, while capital cost decreases with an increase of plant capacity owing to a reduction of equipment unit cost resulting from economies of scale. The effect of reduction in capital cost (which also has an effect on reduction of ROI) on the MSP is larger than that of increasing feedstock cost up to a capacity of approximately 5000 dry-ton-biomass/day, where the optimal MSP value ($1231/ton) is generated. We also performed a single-point sensitivity analysis using various economic parameters to investigate the most influential economic parameters on the MSP of FDCA. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), feedstock price, THF price, activated carbon price, and THFA price were changed by ±30% from their original values. In addition, the discount rate, equity, and tax rate were changed by ±50% from their original values in Fig. 6(b). The results show that THF price, discount rate, equity, and tax rate have a positive correlation with MSP, while activated carbon and THFA price have a negative correlation with MSP. Among the economic parameters, the feedstock price, THFA price, and discount rate are significant cost drivers. A 10% increase in THFA price leads to a 9.2% decrease in MSP, while 10% increases in feedstock price and discount rate lead to MSP increases of 6.7% and 11.3%, respectively."
14,Uncertainty analysis,"4.4 Uncertainty analysis In the technoeconomic analyses performed in the previous section, we assumed each economic parameter to be invariable despite the inherent uncertainty in each economic parameter. Moreover, we can only identify the influence of a single parameter on the economics in sensitivity analysis, not the integrated influence. Based on the influential parameters (THFA price, activated carbon price, and feedstock price) identified in the sensitivity analysis, we therefore performed an uncertainty analysis using the Monte-Carlo simulation method to quantify the risk associated with the proposed process under unpredictable circumstances. We assumed that the selected parameters follow a triangular distribution with equal variation ranges, owing to the limitation of available data (Heo et al., 2020; Li et al., 2015; Ou et al., 2015). The detailed procedure is given in Section G of Supplementary Material. Fig. 7 (a) presents cumulative probability curves coupled with the various ranges of influential parameters (±10 to ±50%) and a fixed discount rate of 20% for the MSP of FDCA. The wider the parameter range, the broader the distribution of the curves, reflecting increased uncertainty. The results indicate that the cumulative probability of the base MSP of FDCA is calculated to be 0.47, meaning that there is 47% probability of a price lower than the base MSP of FDCA, whereas there is a 53% probability of a price higher than the base MSP of FDCA. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the variation of discount rate on the cumulative probability. Fig. 7(b) presents cumulative probability curves coupled with a variation of discount rate (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%) and a fixed range of influential parameters (±20%). We observed that the curves move to the right as the discount rate increases from 10% to 30%. This shows the correlation between discount rate and the MSP of FDCA, indicating that the MSP increases as the discount rate increases. The upper bound of the discount rate is estimated to be 20%, and a discount rate higher than 20% indicates infeasible economics. In summary, we carried out uncertainty analysis using Monte-Carlo simulations to quantify the risk inherent in immature technology and to provide meaningful insight to decision makers seeking to develop a pioneer plant, such as the proposed process."
15,Life-cycle assessment,"4.5 Life-cycle assessment To evaluate the sustainability of the proposed process, we carried out LCA (ISO 14040, 2006a; ISO 14044, 2006b), comparing the environmental impact of bio-based FDCA production and petro-based TPA production (Volanti et al., 2019). See Section H of Supplementary Material. 1 kg of FDCA and TPA was selected as the functional unit, and cradle-to-gate system boundary was assumed. We used SimaPro 9.1 with the ecoinvent 3.6 database and the ReCiPe 1.13 method with the Hierarchist perspective. We focused on climate change, fossil depletion, metal depletion, and photochemical oxidant formation as shown in Fig. 8 . FDCA had less environmental impact on fossil depletion (43%), metal depletion (49%), and photochemical oxidant formation (98%) than TPA. On the other hand, FDCA (100%) had a greater environmental impact on climate change than TPA (76%). This is because a large amount of O2 (0.72 kg CO2 equivalent, 30%) and CO2 (0.64 kg CO2 equivalent, 27%) is used and considerable electricity is consumed (0.63 kg CO2 equivalent, 26%) for FDCA production. Hence, sustainability could be enhanced if electricity-generating resources are replaced with renewable resources (e.g., biogas, wood chips, hydropower, wind power, and nuclear power) rather than burning natural gas."
16,Conclusions,"A new process for economical and sustainable production of FDCA, THFA, and activated carbon was proposed by combining various catalytic conversions and effective separation subsystems. Heat integration was performed to reduce energy demand in energy-intensive units by introducing a heat pump, whereby we could reduce the heating requirement by 71%. The MSP of FDCA for Strategy A (the proposed process) was computed to be $1253/ton, indicating that production of a value-added chemical (THFA) from C5 sugar can improve the economics of the process compared with Strategy B, where C5 is used as a heating energy source. Moreover, the MSP is lower than that of conventional petroleum-derived TPA ($1445/ton), implying that biomass-derived FDCA has the potential to substitute for petroleum-derived TPA. Through a sensitivity analysis, we observed that the lowest MSP was generated at a plant capacity of 5000 dry-ton-biomass/day due to a reduction of capital cost and ROI resulting from economies of scale. Feedstock price, THFA price, and discount rate were identified as the main cost drivers. Therefore, the selection of inexpensive feedstock (e.g., corn stover) can further improve the economics of the proposed process. Moreover, because the main product, i.e., FDCA, is derived from cellulose, biomass with a high content of cellulose (e.g., loblolly pine) has a potential to increase the carbon efficiency, thereby improving the economics. Biomass-based FDCA production becomes a more sustainable process with electricity produced from renewable resources."
