0,Introduction,"Synthesis of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) from either furfural (FAL) or furfuryl alcohol (FA) is of great industrial interests because THFA is an environmentally benign and biodegradable furanic chemical with low toxicity. It has been broadly used as both intermediate and green solvent in agricultural and industrial applications [1,2]. Recently, THFA has also been proposed to be a promising substrate for the preparation of diols [3,4]. Conventionally THFA is produced by a two-step catalytic hydrogenation of FAL via FA as intermediate over Cu–Cr, Ni or noble metal catalysts [5,6]. The second step of FA hydrogenation commonly involves high temperature (>100°C) and high H2 pressure (3–6MPa) [7–15]. Gowda et al. [7] reported a homogeneous Ru(II) bis(diimine) catalyst for hydrogenating FA into THFA under 130°C, 5MPa H2, with 99% selectivity. The difficulties encountered in separation and loss of metal centers strongly limit the practical application of homogeneous catalysts [16]. Adkins and Connor [8] in 1931, for the first time reported the hydrogenation of FA using a heterogeneous Cu–Cr catalyst. The reaction was carried out in liquid phase for 11.5h at 175°C and 10–15MPa hydrogen with THFA yield being less than 10%. A higher THFA selectivity of 48% was achieved over a Raney nickel catalyst under modest temperature [9]. Supported nickel catalysts have been reported to be selective for the synthesis of THFA under very harsh reaction conditions such as 180°C, 3–4MPa H2 and 3.5h [10–13]. Zhang et al. [14] emphasized the hydrogenation of FA over a series of MnO x supported Ru, Pd, Pt and Rh catalysts at 120°C, 3–6MPa for 4h in an aqueous phase and the Ru/MnO x showed the best catalytic performance with 79% yield to THFA. Under harsher conditions (220°C, 3.5MPa H2) the Pd/C catalyst showed full conversion of FA to THFA in isopropanol solvent after 5h [15]. A main drawback of hydrogenation at high temperature is the possible formation of various by-products, such as 2-methylfuran (MF), tetrahydrofuran, 1, 2-pentanediol and 1, 5-pentanediol [8,9,11–15]. Recently, Khan et al. [17] reported a mild hydrogenation process which described the FA hydrogenation on a hectorite-supported Ru nanoparticles in methanolic solution at 40°C under a hydrogen pressure of 20bar and the THFA yield reached 99%. Therefore, selective synthesis of THFA under mild reaction condition is an attractive alternative method to the conventional ones. In this study we report the successful hydrogenation of FA under ambient conditions catalyzed by a Pd-supported sodium-titanate nanotube catalyst, which shows unprecedented activity and selectivity to THFA at room temperature and 1bar H2. The sodium cations in the titanate are thought to play a crucial role in stabilizing well-dispersed Pd metal particles as well as inhibiting MF formation."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Titanate nanotubes (TNT) were prepared according to the reference [18]. Typically, commercial anatase-type TiO2 (2g) was added to 100mL of NaOH aqueous solution (10M). After being stirred for 10min, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined (120mL) stainless steel autoclave and statically heated in an oven at 130°C for 72h. The white product was filtered and washed with large amount of deionized water until the pH was 7. The final products were subsequently dried at 110°C overnight, calcined at various temperatures (400, 600 and 800°C) for 3h and labeled as TNT-T (400, 600 and 800, respectively). For comparison, we also prepared the proton-exchanged TNT with 0.1M HCl solution to investigate the acid-base properties of TNT samples. After that, the mixture was filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried at 110°C and labeled as TNT-H. Pd supported on commercial anatase-type TiO2 or TNTs were prepared using a deposition-reduction method. The support (0.5g) was dispersed in H2O (60mL) with stirring. A specified amount of H2PdCl4 aqueous solution (21.512gPd/L) was added to the mixture and stirred for 3h. The final pH value of the suspension was adjusted to 10 by adding NaOH solution (1M). Then, NaBH4 aqueous solution (NaBH4/Pd=10, molar ratio) was added into the suspension and the mixture was stirred for another 30min allowing for the full reduction of Pd2+ species. Thus obtained catalyst was dried at 110°C overnight."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196°C were obtained on a BELSORP-Max equipment. Prior to the measurement, the samples were first degassed at 150°C under vacuum for 6h. Specific surface areas (SSA) were calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using five relative pressure points in the interval of 0.05–0.30. The pore size distribution was obtained by the BJH model applied to the adsorption isotherm. Pulse CO chemisorption was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 to determine the metal dispersion of the reduced catalysts. Prior to measurement, the catalyst was reduced in a flow of 80mL/min 10vol.% H2 in Ar at 80°C for 2h and then cooled to 30°C by flushing He for 2h. Afterwards, CO gas pluses (5vol.% in He) were introduced in a flow of 110mL/min. The gas phase CO concentration was followed by thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The Pd loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) on a Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP atomic emission spectrometer. About 5mg catalysts were digested using 10mL of aqua regia. The obtained solutions were diluted with deionized water before test. The power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5405Å) operated at 35kV and 25mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 microscope operating at 300kV. The average Pd particle size was calculated by d TEM =(Σn i d i 3)/(Σn i d i 2) by measuring at least 100 particles. Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) testing was performed using a TP-5080 chemisorption instrument (Xianquan Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). After pretreatment at 400°C under flowing He (25mL/min) for 1h, each sample (100mg) was cooled to 100°C, and then adsorbed to saturation by NH3 for 30min. The physisorbed NH3 was removed by flushing the sample with He (25mL/min) for 1h at the adsorption temperature. NH3 desorption was carried out in the temperature range of 100–400°C at ramp rate of 10°C/min. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption measurements were performed on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with a vacuum cell. Catalyst samples were pressed into self-supported disks (12–22mg with diameter of 13mm) and activated under vacuum (1×10−3 Pa) at 350°C. After activation the samples were cooled to room temperature. A spectroscopy of the activated sample was recorded as background. Adsorption of pyridine was conducted at room temperature. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TG) was performed using a NET2SCH STA449F3 TGA analyzer with ramp rate of 10°C/min from 25 to 800°C in N2 flow. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLDmulti-technique X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, equipped with a monochromated Al Kα radiation (E =1486.6eV). The C 1s peak with binding energy of 284.6eV was taken as energy reference."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests A two-necked round-bottom flask was used to carry out the liquid phase hydrogenation of FA. No pretreatment on the catalyst was conducted prior to reaction. The reactor was charged with FA (0.2mL), solvent (4mL) and catalyst (50mg), and the mixture was stirred under ambient hydrogen pressure (balloon) at 25°C for 1h. The products were analyzed with flame ionization detector (FID) and capillary column DB-FFAP (30m length and 0.25mm internal diameter). The spent catalyst was recovered by centrifugation washing with ethanol for three times, and then drying in vacuum. The activity of the recovered catalyst was tested under the same conditions as that applied for the fresh sample."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of TNTs,"3.1 Characterization of TNTs Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the commercial anatase-type TiO2 and the TNTs. Diffraction peaks positioned at 9.8, 24 and 28° assigned to the titanates such as Na2Ti2O5·H2O and Na2Ti3O7 are noticed on TNT (Fig. 1c) [18]. Upon calcination at 600°C, the titanates crystalline domains became enlarged according to the sharpening of the peaks, along with the appearance of weak peaks (12, 24.5, 29.8 and 30.5°) assigned to Na2Ti6O13 for TNT-600 (Fig. 1e). After calcination at 800°C, the intensity of Na2Ti6O13 peaks slightly increased and new peaks assigned to brookite (24.6 and 30.6°) were found for TNT-800 (Fig. 1f), which could be derived from the dehydration of Na x Ti2−x Ti2O5·H2O and the removal of surface electrostatic charge [19]. After proton-exchange with 0.1M HCl solution, there appears to be a decrease in the intensity of peak at 28° compared to that of 9.8 and 24° for TNT-H (Fig. 1b). This has been ascribed to the ionic exchange of Na+ with H+ in the titanates along with the phase transformation from Na2Ti2O5·H2O to H2Ti2O5·H2O [20]. SEM images of TNT and TNT-T (400, 600 and 800) are displayed in Fig. 2 . The diameter and length of titanates with nanotube structure are in the range of 10–12nm and 100–400nm for TNT (Fig. 2a), respectively. It is believed that the sheet-like particles were rolling in to nanotubes during the washing [18]. After calcination at 400°C, the morphology of TNT-400 (Fig. 2b) is almost identical to that of the TNT. Further increase of the temperature to 600°C resulted in collapse of the nanotubes into rod-like structures with diameters of 50–70nm (Fig. 2c), which is likely due to the dehydration of interlayered OH groups [21]. For TNT-800, the rod-like titanates agglomerated to cylindrical particles with length of 200–300nm upon calcination at 800°C (Fig. 2d). Ammonia is a commonly used probe molecule to estimate the acidic amount and strength of the catalyst. From the results illustrated in Fig. 3 , almost no desorption of NH3 could be observed for anatase and TNT confirming that anatase and TNT do not possess strong acid sites. After proton-exchange with HCl, the amount of acid sites on TNT-H was 0.337mmolg−1 and most ammonia desorbed in the range of 150–300°C, indicating the presence of acid sites with moderate strength. The acid property of the TNT and TNT-H was also investigated by pyridine adsorption FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 4 ). For both samples, the bands observed at ca. 1445 and ca. 1605cm−1 are assigned to the adsorbed pyridine bound to Lewis acid sites (coordinative unsaturated Ti4+ sites) [22,23]. The slightly weak bands at ca. 1488 and ca. 1574cm−1 are due to the ring breathing (υCCN, 19a and 8b) modes of pyridine molecules [23]. The two broad bands at 1540 and 1635cm−1 were only observed on TNT-H. The appearance of these bands is resulted from the protonation of pyridine into pyridinium ions indicating the availability of Brønsted acid sites [22–24]. From this result, we can see that the proton-exchange of TNT leads to the generation of Brønsted acid sites on TNT-H which are absent on the surface of TNT. The adsorption behavior of FA on these samples was studied by TG. TG curves for pristine anatase and different titanates (TNTs) after adsorbing FA vapor overnight are shown in Fig. 5 . The TG curves of both TNT and TNT-H showed a broad peak (100–650°C) centered at 350°C relating to desorption of physisorbed FA. On the contrary, anatase did not show any remarkable weight loss indicating that FA hardly adsorbs on the anatase. This result suggests that both the acid sites (OH groups) and the surface ONa species are responsible for the strong adsorption of FA on TNTs."
7,Characterization of Pd/TNTs,"3.2 Characterization of Pd/TNTs The BET specific surface areas (SSA) of the supports and Pd catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The as-synthesized TNT sample showed surface area of 31.4m2/g, about 4 times higher than that of the pristine anatase material (8.3m2/g). After loading Pd, the resulting 5Pd/TNT had an even higher surface area of 95.1m2/g. This increase may arise from the structural evolution during the synthesis. It is believed that the surface area of TNT may substantially increase by treatment of acid washing due to the rolling of the H2Ti3O7 sheets to tubes [25], which may also apply in this case because substantial amount of HCl was present in the Pd containing solution. This phenomenon may also be used to explain the large surface area of 3Pd/TNT-H and 5Pd/TNT-H (126 and 117m2/g, respectively). Upon calcination at 400, 600 and 800°C, the surface area was 77.4, 22.5 and 11.2m2/g, respectively. The decrease of surface area is resulted by the collapse of tube structure during calcination. The particle size and metal dispersion of palladium on TNTs were characterized by TEM and CO chemisorption, respectively. Typical TEM images of the supported Pd catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . Narrow distribution of palladium particle size (2–8nm) was obtained for all catalysts and the average particle size is about 5.1nm. The homogeneously distribution of palladium particles in small size (Fig. 6b and d) on TNT/TNT-H implies that palladium hydroxides were deposited on these supports uniformly during precipitation. The CO chemisorption results are also listed in Table 1. The 5Pd/anatase catalyst used as a reference gave a dispersion of 3%. This very low Pd dispersion might be due to the extremely low surface area of anatase or a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pd and anatase surface [25–28]. For 1, 3 and 5Pd/TNT catalysts, Pd dispersion was close to 27%, which was substantially higher than that of 5Pd/anatase. The high Pd dispersion was probably attributed to the high surface area of TNT and the presence of residual sodium cation in the titanate. The latter point has been observed for TiO2 support Pt and Pd catalysts by several research groups [29–31]. Higher Pd loading up to 10wt.% led to a decrease of Pd dispersion to 14%. For Pd supported on TNT-H, the metal dispersion was relatively low and was close to 10%, which also points to the role of Na+ in promoting Pd dispersion. For calcined TNTs, the Pd dispersion values of Pd/TNT-400, -600 and 800 were 27, 32 and 13%, respectively. We surmise that the poor textural properties of TNT-800 result in low dispersion of Pd. To reveal the oxidation states of the supported Pd particles, the XPS core level spectra of Pd 3d of Pd/anatase, Pd/TNT, Pd/TNT-H were investigated and the deconvoluted XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 7 . The Pd 3d peaks can be deconvoluted into two oxidation states, namely metallic Pd (∼335eV) and Pd2+ (∼336.5eV). The calculated abundance of two species is summarized in Table S1. For three catalysts the ratio of Pd0 ranges from 45 to 65%. It can be found from Fig. 7 that the Pd 3d5/2 of Pd/anatase showed a significant lower BE of 334.6eV, with respect to 335.3eV of the 5Pd/TNT and 335.5eV of 5Pd/TNT-H. This result indicates that Pd nanoparticles are negatively charged on the NaBH4 reduced Pd/anatase catalyst and the SMSI is present [32,33]. On the contrary, a relatively weak electronic interaction between Pd and TNT(-H) is noticed."
8,Catalytic activities of supported Pd catalysts,"3.3 Catalytic activities of supported Pd catalysts As an initial test, we first investigated the hydrogenation activities of supported Pd catalysts for FA in terms of conversion and selectivity by using C2H4Cl2 as solvent (Table 2 ). C2H4Cl2 is an interesting solvent which can render high hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis activity for supported Pd catalysts [34]. For Pd/TNT with loading of 1, 3, 5 and 10wt.% (entries 3–6), the TOFs were 0.21, 0.40, 0.60 and 0.40molFA gPd −1 h−1, respectively. The highest TOF of THFA was obtained on 5Pd/TNT, which almost doubles the value of 5Pd/anatase (entry 2). The trend of turnover frequencies was in good agreement with that of the metal dispersion of Pd on TNTs. This result suggests that the unique porous tube-structure of titanate with high surface area favors the dispersion of Pd particles [35,36]. On the other hand, the stronger adsorption of FA on TNT than that on anatase may also lead to adsorption-enhanced hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reactivity [37]. It should be noted that the selectivity of THFA exceeded 90% for Pd/TNT catalysts (entries 3–6), while it was only 31% on 5Pd/anatase catalyst (entry 2). The dominant product in FA hydrogenation on 5Pd/anatase is MF. It has been proposed that MF is produced via a hydrogenolysis reaction pathway which takes place on the oxidized Pd2+ according to a recent study [34]. The presence of both Pd2+ and Pd0 species are undoubtedly confirmed by XPS (Fig. 7) in our case. Therefore we speculate that the metallic Pd catalyzes the hydrogenation reaction, which competes with the hydrogenolysis on Pd2+ in this process. Both reaction pathways were also clearly observed on a commercial 5Pd/C catalyst (entry 1), which showed 68% FA conversion and 32% selectivity to MF. This finding is consistent with previous reports [38–43]. Bradley et al. [38] have shown that Pd can readily adsorb furan ring due to a strong interaction between the metal and the π bonds in the molecule. The strong interaction, due to a re-hybridization of the carbon bonds from sp2-to-sp3 has been proposed to occur on Pd, which may account for the formation of THFA. Pang and Medlin [39] have found that furfuryl alcohol underwent CO scission yielding MF as a product. The DFT calculation results suggested that the adsorption of CO bond of hydroxyalkyl species paralleling to the Pd (111) surface may also favor the CO scission therefore yielding MF [39–42]. Interestingly, this reaction pathway can be inhibited by potassium promoter [39,43], which well explains the very low yield of MF in Pd/TNTs. Indeed, when Na+ was exchanged by proton, higher MF selectivity was noticed as observed for 3Pd/TNT-H catalyst (entry 7). However, this reaction pathway change is not pronounced for 5Pd/TNT-H (entry 8), probably because of the very high hydrogenation activity for high Pd loading catalysts. Also shown in Table 2 is the effect of calcination temperature of TNT on the catalytic activity of supported Pd catalysts. The TOFs of Pd/TNT-400, 600, and 800 are 0.43, 0.69, and 0.11molFA gPd −1 h−1, respectively. Pd/TNT-600 showed the highest TOF and THFA selectivity of 89% (entry 10). In contrast, Pd/TNT-800 (entry 11) showed the lowest activity (12% FA conversion) as well as the highest selectivity to MF (32%) among three catalysts. This result points to the effect of surface changes upon calcination on the catalytic activity. The SEM images (Fig. 2d) showed that the morphology of TNT-800 was cylindrical particles with diameter varying from 0.2 to 1μm. These large particles had very low SSA (11m2/g). Moreover, the surface structure probably relates to the brookite crystalline. We therefore speculate that the distinct different catalytic behavior of Pd/TNT-800 relates to these structural changes."
9,"Solvent effect, kinetics and reusability","3.4 Solvent effect, kinetics and reusability The reaction performed in C2H4Cl2 proceeded smoothly, yet cleaner solvents are desirable. Therefore the hydrogenation in other solvents (ethanol, isopropanol, toluene, heptane and water) was conducted and the results are shown in Table 3 . The reactivity follows the trend of ethanol>C2H4Cl2 >isopropanol>toluene>heptane>H2O. Ethanol gave the best catalytic performance amongst the solvents investigated, and the selectivity to THFA was the highest (98%) with minute production of MF. This result emphasizes the essential role of solvent used in determining the hydrogenation activity [44]. Compared with water, alcohols have a better H2 solubility and can also stabilize the reactive intermediates [45,46]. When heptane and toluene were used, the catalyst particles were not well dispersed and probably led to diffusion-limitations even upon very high stirring rate. The results suggested that alcohols are suitable solvents for this reaction. We also investigated the effects of initial FA concentration, and hydrogen pressure on the catalytic performances (Tables S2 and S3). The results suggested that that the THFA selectivity did not change with the increase in initial FA concentration. Meanwhile the TOF was slightly increased with the increase in FA concentration. This phenomenon may be explained by the competitive adsorption of product (THFA) and reactants (hydrogen and FA) on the catalyst surface [1]. It was also observed that the TOF increased with the increase of hydrogen pressure (Table S3) and the reaction order with respect to hydrogen was estimated to be 0.2. Increasing the reaction temperature from 25 to 50°C led to slightly decrease of FA conversion by 20%. This result probably implies that the adsorption of reactants (probably FA) is inhibited at high temperature. Further increase of temperature is not desirable since the FA easily undergoes polymerization. The recyclability of 5Pd/TNT catalyst was evaluated through three repeated reactions in ethanol and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . It shows that the catalytic performance of the 5Pd/TNT catalyst remains almost the same after the first time, but the activity of the catalyst dropped drastically after being used two times. Chemical analysis (ICP) of the catalyst after reaction revealed no leaching of Pd. The activity loss after two runs of reaction may be due to the strong adsorption of FA or possible polymerization of FA on the catalyst [42,47]. To our delight the selectivity to THFA of the Pd/TNT was maintained. Further study is necessary to achieve high reusability of this catalyst by structural modification."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, TNT with Na2Ti2O5·H2O and Na2Ti3O7 structures was prepared by a hydrothermal method and used as support of Pd nanoparticles. This Pd/TNT was found to be highly active in FA hydrogenation under mild conditions (25°C, H2 balloon). 5Pd/TNT showed the highest turnover frequency of 0.60molFA gPd −1 h−1. The effect of different solvents on the catalysis was also conducted and the ethanol gave the best catalytic performance (98% conversion of FA and 98% selectivity to THFA) amongst the solvents investigated. The performance of the catalyst is strongly affected by the nature of Pd and the unique surface structure of TNT showing strong FA adsorption ability."
