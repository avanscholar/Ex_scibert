0,Introduction,"Nowadays, chemotherapy is still one of the major solutions for cancer treatment. However, the unsatisfied delivery efficiency and serious adverse effects of chemotherapeutic agents hinder the cure of cancer [1–3]. Hence, improving the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs and drug delivery efficiency become a key issue to be considered for cancer therapy [4,5]. Hydrogen (H2), as a kind of endogenous gas with physiological/pathological regulation functions and high bio-safety, has been confirmed as a powerful therapeutic antioxidant that can scavenge cytotoxic oxygen radicals of major diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimers and Parkinson's disease [6–12]. According to the literature, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are commonly found in cancerous tissues [13]. The increased ROS not only are oncogenic, but also act as signaling molecules for abnormal cell growth, metastasis, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis and differentiation block in lung, breast or colon cancer [14,15]. Recent studies have proved that either increase or decrease of rightly overexpressed ROS level in cancer cells could break the redox homoeostasis, thus resulting in the apoptosis of cancer cells [16,17]. Hence, scavenging ROS could be used as a new strategy for the cancer therapy. It is interesting that H2 has been confirmed to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by scavenging ROS and further disturbing the cellular redox homeostasis, without affecting the normal cells [6,12,18]. It is commonly accepted that the anti-oxidative H2 could selectively reduce the highly-oxidative toxic radicals such as hydroxylradical [7,9,10,19–21]. Besides, it has been recently reported that H2 could also down-regulate of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activate endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase to perform the antioxidant effect [6]. However, the nonpolarity and low solubility of H2 under the physiological conditions result in limited therapeutic efficacy. To overcome the undesired performance of H2, various H2 carriers including PdH0.2 nanocrystals, MgB2 Nanosheet and Fe nanoparticles were fabricated to achieve the storage, targeted delivery and controlled release of H2 [18–20,22,23]. However, those approaches rely on H2 loaded porous nondegradable micro and nanoparticles, which are of limited loading capacity, tissue penetration capability and biocompatibility. In addition, all the H2 delivery until now were based on the passive diffusion, which may restrict the dissolution of H2 in aqueous solution. Therefore, how to improve the H2 delivery efficacy is still challenging. Micro-/nanomotors that can convert chemical or physical energies into mechanical motion have attracted considerable attentions for their promising biomedical applications for example diagnosis [24,25], minimally invasive surgery [26–28], active drug delivery [29–35]. Especially for active drug delivery, the active motion of micro-/nanomotors endowed them huge advantages compared to their passive counterparts [36–40], which could be suitable perfectly for improving tumor therapeutic effect [30,41–47]. To take advantage of tumor inhibition from H2, the active delivery of H2 and chemotherapeutics may function as a novel strategy to further improve the synergistic therapeutic effects towards cancer. Among different types of micromotors, the Mg-based Janus micromotors show great potential towards in vivo applications owing to their autonomous propulsion under body fluids, cargo transport and release, and their transient biodegradability [48-51]. Compared with other transition (Zn, Fe), or alkali metals (Na, Ca), Mg is of particular interest with a tailored degradation behavior under physiological or buffer conditions. Hence the speed and motion time of Mg based micromotors can be easily tuned either by ions or the design of micromotor [52]. Moreover, the controllable motion of Mg-based micromotor under blood plasma without any addition of external toxic fuels endows it a fascinating prospect for biomedical application [24,53,54]. In our case, most importantly, the capability of self-sacrificing and water-consuming (into H2) allows Mg micromotors to be a clean and ideal H2 generator and the formed H2 is also the propellant for motion. Here, we demonstrate the design of organic-inorganic hybrid Mg micromotor for enhanced active and synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy (Scheme 1 ). Biodegradable micromotors were fabricated by using Mg microparticles as templates and subsequently coating with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) asymmetrically, which is promising for drug delivery due to its degradable characteristics and improved drug loading capacity. The H2 produced by Mg-water reaction was able to achieve enhanced diffusion due to the motion of micromotors, offering possibility for enhanced ROS scavenging (special for •OH) (Scheme 1C). By using Mg micromotors for active and synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy, an outstanding performance towards tumor cells was achieved (Scheme 1D)."

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element analysis was carried out with an EDX analyzer (mounted on the Phenom FEI-SEM Pharos) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Nikon Ti2-A inversion fluorescence microscope were used to capture cell morphology and motion of Mg-motor. A Multi-function plate reader (Tecan, Infinite M1000 Pro, Swiss) was used to detect the cell fluorescence intensity."
4,Fabrication of Mg-motor and Mg-plga microparticles,"2.3 Fabrication of Mg-motor and Mg-plga microparticles Fabrication of Mg-motor: Mg microparticles were used as the core to prepare Mg-based micromotors (named as Mg-motor). The Mg microparticles were initially washed with acetone to remove the impurities, then dried under N2 flow. Subsequently, 1 mg of Mg microparticles were dispersed onto a glass slide precoated with a thin film of poly(vinylpyrrolidinone) (PVP). After that, the formed Mg microparticles layer were coated with PLGA or the mixture of PLGA and DOX in ethyl acetate. The resulting Mg-motors were scraped carefully from the glass slide. The DOX loaded Mg-motor was named as Mg-motor-DOX. Fabrication of Mg-PLGA microparticles: The same prewashing method as mentioned in 2.1 was used to fabricate Mg-PLGA microparticles that couldn't release hydrogen. Firstly, 100 μL of PVP ethyl alcohol solution (2 mg•mL−1) was casted on a glass slide to form a thin film, followed by adding 60 μL of PLGA ethyl acetate solution (1 w/w%). Subsequently, 1 mg of Mg microparticles were dispersed onto the thin layer of PLGA, then another 60 μL of PLGA solution was added, so as to fabricate well encapsulated Mg-PLGA microparticles. The DOX loaded Mg-PLGA microparticle was named as Mg-PLGA-DOX."
5,Characterization of Mg-motor,"2.4 Characterization of Mg-motor Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained by a Phenom LE instrument (Phenom, Eindhoven, Netherlands) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element mapping was acquired by an EDX detector mounted on the Phenom FEI-SEM Pharos with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and analyzed by ProSuite software. Before measurement, all samples were attached onto the conductive adhesives, then coated with platinum using a Quorum Q150V Plus ion sputtering system (Quorum Technologies Co., Ltd, Laughton, United Kingdom). Bight-field and fluorescent images of the Mg-motors were captured by Nikon microscope coupled with × 20 microscope objectives and fluorescence filter for red light excitation. The fluorescence and bright-filed images of Mg motor (stained with Nile red) were captured on Nikon Ti2-A inversion fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Instrument Inc.)."
6,Motion of Mg-motor,"2.5 Motion of Mg-motor The RPMI 1640 culture medium for HT29 and 4T1 cells was used as main solution of the simulated body fluid (SBF). And the movements of Mg-motor were evaluated in SBF supplemented with 0.3 M NaHCO3 and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C to character the motion trajectory. A Nikon Ti2-A inverted optical microscope equipped with a high-speed camera (Nikon, DS-Qi2) and NIS Elements AR 3.2 software was used to observe and record the motion of Mg-motor with 10 frames per second (time interval between each frames ∆T = 100 ms). Tracking image sequences were analyzed with Image J plugin manual tracking according to the previous report[55]. At least 25 micromotors were tracked to calculate the average speeds."
7,Measurement of the ROS level in cells,"2.6 Measurement of the ROS level in cells Measure intracellular ROS level by DCFH-DA probes: HT29 or 4T1 cells were seeded onto 96-well plate with density of 5 × 103 cells per well and cultivated in 100 μL RPMI 1640 culture medium. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced by the fresh serum-free one containing the pure Mg microparticles with a series concentration of 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 μg•mL−1 and NaHCO3 (0.3 M). After incubated for 2 h, the medium was removed and each well was washed with the fresh serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium to remove residual samples. Then, the DCFH-DA probes (100 μL, 10 μM) was added into each well and the resulting 96-well plate was monitored by a multi-mode microplate reader (excitation/emission = 488/525 nm). The fluorescence images of the two cells were obtained using an invert microscope after removing medium and washing three times with PBS. Measure intracellular ROS level by CellROX probes: HT29 cells (2 × 105 mL−1) or 4T1 cells (1 × 105 mL−1) were seeded onto 12-well plate and cultivated in RPMI 1640 culture medium. After 48 h, the culture medium was replaced by fresh serum-free ones containing the prepared samples with final concentrations of 300 μg•mL−1 and NaHCO3 (0.3 M). After incubated for 6 h, the medium was removed and each well was washed with the fresh serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium to remove residual samples. Then, the CellROX probes (200 μL, 5 μM) was added, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then remove medium and wash the cells for 3 times with PBS, and fix the cells with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were stained by an antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI. The ROS changing of the cells was analyzed by using an Olympus fluorescent microscope."
8,Measurement of DOX uptake efficacy of cancer cell,"2.7 Measurement of DOX uptake efficacy of cancer cell HT29 or 4T1 cells with density of 1 × 104 cells per well were seeded onto 24-well plates and cultivated in RPMI 1640 for 48 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced by fresh serum-free ones containing Mg-motor-DOX and Mg-PLGA-DOX (150 μg•mL−1) and NaHCO3 (0.3 mol•L − 1) and co-cultured for 6 h. Then the cells were washed with PBS for 3 times before staining with DAPI (final concentration 10 μg•mL−1, 10 min). Finally, the cell were washed with PBS and the fluorescence images were captured on Nikon Ti2-A inversion fluorescence microscope."
9,Cytotoxicity analysis,"2.8 Cytotoxicity analysis HT29 or 4T1 cells with density of 5 × 103 cells per well were seeded onto 96-well plates and cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. Then the cells were incubated respectively with Mg-motor-DOX, Mg-motor, Mg-PLGA-DOX, Mg and Mg-PLGA in RPMI 1640 medium. After another 24 h incubation, the medium was carefully removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, 110 µL MTT in fresh culture medium (0.5 mg•mL−1) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the culture medium was carefully removed, and 100 µL DMSO was added per well, followed by 10 min shaking on a horizontal shaker. Biotek 800 TS plate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 490 nm."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Fabrication and characterization of Mg micromotors,"3.1 Fabrication and characterization of Mg micromotors Mg microparticles were first imbedded onto the PVP film and further encapsulated with biodegradable PLGA [56]. After being scraped from the plates, a loophole was formed on one side of the resulting Mg microsphere. According to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the pure Mg microparticles exhibited a spherical structure with an average size of 23 ± 5 μm (Fig. S1a-c, Supporting Information). While after PLGA coating, the formed Mg micromotors (named as Mg-motor) displayed a spherical geometry with a small circular opening (Fig. 1 A and B). Compared with the pure Mg microparticles, the Mg-motor was demonstrated a larger size (27 ± 5 μm, Fig. S1i, Supporting Information) owing to the coated PLGA shell. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results in Fig. 1B illustrated the presence and elemental distribution of Mg from the core and C and O from PLGA shell within the micromotor structure. The pure Mg microparticle exhibited a smooth surface with less carbon covered when compared with that of micromotor (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). The typical Janus structure of the Mg-motor could be attributed to the partial Mg microparticles embedded in the PVP films on glass slides during PLGA coating. Due to the polymeric structure, hydrophobic Nile red or antitumor drug DOX was loaded into PLGA shell respectively, which further confirmed the asymmetric distribution of polymer layer on the Mg microparticles (Fig. 1C and D). The loading efficiency of DOX, calculated according to the standard curve of DOX (Fig. S3a, Supporting Information), was 33.61 μg•mg−1 (Fig. S3b, Supporting Information). In our work, the small opening of the Mg-motor could act as Mg-water reaction interface for H2 generation under the gastric and intestine fluid or even serum environment, therefore resulting in the autonomous motion."
12,Motion of Mg micromotors,"3.2 Motion of Mg micromotors After confirming the structure, we next evaluated the motion of the Mg-motor under SBF. According to the previous reports, the mobility of the micromotors could be affected by environmental factors such as components, viscosity and temperature[57]. When using nano/micromotors for purpose of biomedicine, the complicated component of biofluid could affect the motion behaviours of nano/micromotors [58–61]. Therefore, to precisely evaluate the motion enhanced H2 and DOX delivery in cultured cancer cells, we chose the cell culture medium as the basic media to mimic the SBF environment. The schematic image in Fig. 2 A illustrated that the continuous H2 generation could propel Mg-motor to achieve autonomous motion in SBF. An invert microscopy was used to record the trajectory of the Mg-motor, which displayed different motion behaviors, such as spiral or linear mode (Fig. 2B-C; captured from Videos S1 and S2, Supporting Information). Image J with manual tracking module was further applied to analyze the trajectory path and the motion characteristics including average velocity, directionality, and accumulate distance (Fig. 2E). Owing to the gradual Mg depletion in SBF, the Mg-motor displayed a lifetime of ≈ 4.5 min with an average speed up to 57 ± 19 μm•s − 1. It was noted that once the Mg core was fully depleted (i.e., completion of the Mg-proton reaction as shown in Video S3, Supporting Information), the Mg-motor stopped only with PLGA shell left (Fig. S4, Supporting Information), as illustrated in the corresponding Video S4 (Supporting Information)."
13,Assessment of active hydrogen released by Mg micromotors,"3.3 Assessment of active hydrogen released by Mg micromotors To evaluate the controlled release and bio-reductivity of H2 in SBF, MB was used as an oxidative probe for H2 detection. Generally, MB can react with H2 in the presence of Pt (Pt nanoparticles 50 nm, Fig. S5, Supporting Information) to produce colorless reduced leucomethylene blue (leucoMB) according to the followed equation [62]: (1) MB ( blue ) + 2 H + + 2 e − → leucoMB ( colorless ) Therefore, the color fading of MB was used to quantify the release of reductive H2 from Mg microparticle, Mg-motor and Mg-PLGA respectively (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). As for the pure Mg microparticle, the absorbance of MB at 644 nm was sharply decreased in 20 min then increased afterwards, indicating the fast H2 releasing (Fig. S7a, Supporting Information) owing to the rapid degradation of Mg in SBF. While for Mg-motor, it lasted for 40 min which was two times longer than that of Mg microparticle (Fig. S7b, Supporting Information). The prolonged and controlled H2 release from Mg-motor was attributed to the gradual Mg depletion from the Janus structure. Besides, the well encapsulated Mg-PLGA microparticles exhibited a extremely lower H2 release (Fig. S7c, Supporting Information). The intracellular reductivity of H2 released from Mg-motor were also tested by the MB-Pt probe. As shown in Fig. S8 (Supporting Information), both 4T1 and HT29 stained with MB showed deep blue at 0 min. While the color was sharply decreased in 60 min then slightly increased afterwards (120 min) after incubating with Mg-motor. The decrease in color demonstrated that active H2 release was possible to across cytomembrane and penetrate into cells, indicating the significant intracellular time-dependent bio-reductivity of Mg-motor. Considering the bio-reducibility of H2, the overexpressed ROS (especial for hydroxyl radical) in tumor cells could be eliminated by the active H2 produced by Mg-motor. Fig. 3 A shows schematically the experimental design of motion enhanced intracellular ROS scavenging. Fluorogenic ROS probe (CellROX Green reagent) was used to measure the ROS level in both two model cells. The cell-permeable CellROX is nonfluorescent in its reduced state while it binds onto DNA and becomes fluorescence upon oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3B-IV and 3E-IV, Mg-motor showed the highest ROS scavenging ability in both HT29 and 4T1 cells due to the motion enhanced H2 diffusion and dissolution in aqueous as illustrated in Fig. S8 (Supporting Information). To further evaluate the ROS scavenging ability of Mg-motor, another ROS probe (DCFH-DA) was used to detect the intracellular ROS level. It should be noted that DCFH-DA can also permeate into cell, then be degraded by intracellular lipase and converted into DCFH. The formed DCFH can be further oxidized into fluorescent DCF, which has a positive correlation with intracellular ROS level. The fluorescence intensity of Mg-motor and Mg microparticles showed a significant decrease in both two cells (Fig. 3C-D, Fig. S9 in Supporting Information). It should be noted that Mg-motor exhibited over 12 times ROS scavenge efficacy than that of the passive microparticles (Fig. S10, Supporting Information). According to previous reports, H2 could break redox homoeostasis, leading to the apotosis of cancer cells [6,20,22]. Hence, it is fascinating that the stronger ROS scanvenge ability of Mg-motor by delivering active H2 could be a new stragey for cancer therapy."
14,Synergistic therapeutic effect of Mg motors in vitro,"3.4 Synergistic therapeutic effect of Mg motors in vitro The motion of Mg-motor can be used not only to deliver active H2 as we discussed above, but also to improve the drug delivery efficacy [52]. To verify synergistic therapeutic effect of Mg motors by coupling active delivery of H2 and chemotherapeutic drug, DOX, which could inhibit the growth of tumor by interfering the function of DNA by inhibiting activity of topoisomerase II, has been chosen as the model drug loaded on the Mg-motor. After incubating with Mg-motor-DOX for 6 h, the intracellular uptake of DOX by two tumor cells was evaluated respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 A-B, the intracellular DOX fluorescence was significantly increased in both 4T1 and HT29 cells, indicating that the motion of the micromotor could promote the uptake of DOX efficiently. While much less fluorescence was observed in HT29 cells, probably because of the difference between various tumor cells [63,64]. The semiquantitative analysis of intracellular DOX (Fig. 4C-D) was further calculated three times by Image J to obtain the average value of fluorescence intensity (see Supporting Information). It was interesting to find that the fluorescence intensity of DOX in 4T1 and HT29 cells was improved more than 17 and 5 times respectively when compared with non-motor groups (Mg-PLGA-DOX). Calcein-AM /PI kit was further used to test the ratio between living and death cells after treatment. The strongest red fluorescence (dead cells) was observed after incubating with Mg-motor-DOX due to combined hydrogenchemical therapy. (Fig. S11, Supporting Information) This suggested that the hydrogen chemotherapy had greater suppression on tumor cells, particularly for 4T1 cells, which could be ascribed to enhanced DOX therapeutic efficacy induced by synergistic effects of the active drug delivery and sustained hydrogen release. We further evaluated the therapeutic effect of active hydrogenchemical therapy on both HT29 and 4T1 cells (Fig. 4E-F). No significant cytotoxicity was observed for Mg-PLGA (without H2 production), Mg microparticles (passive H2 delivery), Mg-motor (active H2 delivery) and Mg-PLGA-DOX (single chemotherapy) when the Mg concentration was lower than 100 mg•mL−1. However, lowest viability in both cancer cell lines especially for 4T1 cells was demonstrated when incubating with Mg-motor-DOX. (Fig. 4E-F) HT29 cells were less sensitive to DOX than 4T1 cells, which could be attributed to the drug resistance of cancer cells [63]. When the concentration of Mg-motor-DOX increased from 50 to 100 μg•mL−1 (DOX concentration was 1.5 to 3.0 μg•mL−1 accordingly), the viability of 4T1 cell decreased sharply from 92.37% to 31.00%, which exhibited remarkably improved cytotoxicity compared with DOX and other DOX loaded nanodrugs reported previously [65–74]. While for Mg-PLGA-DOX (non-motor), the viability decreased slightly from 91.34% (50 μg•mL−1) to 75.43% (100 μg•mL−1). The huge difference in cell viability bewteen motor and non-motor groups demonstrated a significantly improved therapeutic effects due to the active H2 induced enhanced sensitivity of cancer cells to DOX, indicating the superiority of combined active H2 and enhanced chemotherapy. According to the results displayed above, it was obvious that such synergistic anticancer effects could be valuable to improve cancer therapeutic efficacy in future."
15,Conclusion,"In summary, we demonstrated a facile approach for engineering a fully biodegradable Mg micromotor based H2 generating system for active hydrogen chemotherapy for the first time. By consuming water in local biological environment, the designed Mg micromotors were able to propel in SBF efficiently. This leads to a controlled generation and enhanced diffusion of H2 which allowed for higher intracellular ROS scavenging and redox homoeostasis re-establishment. The locally produced H2 by Mg micromotors could further improve the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy. Due to the self-propulsion, Mg micromotors exhibited much higher drug delivery efficiency, resulting in enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy. The concept of Mg micromotor based active hydrogenchemical therapy represent a concrete step towards clinical translation of hydrogen-chemo antitumor therapy. We envision that such artificial biodegradable micromotor delivery system could have wide applications in various diseases related with elevated ROS level by regulating the physiological/pathological functions."
