0,Introduction,"In recent years, countries in the world have gradually turned their attention to carbon emissions, due to excessive carbon emissions lead to global warming, glaciers melting and sea level rising, which seriously threaten the survival of human beings [1]. The research suggested that the carbon emissions of transportation accounted for 23% of global carbon emissions [2]. Therefore, how to reduce the carbon emissions [3] of the transportation industry has become an urgent problem for all countries to solve [4]. Developing preferable alternative fuels has been proved to be a desirable approach [5]. Among available fuels, hydrogen is a very special one [6]. Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen does not contain carbon, therefore, no carbon emissions will be produced when hydrogen is used as a fuel [7]. Moreover, hydrogen has some physicochemical properties [8] that make it ideal for use as the fuel of the internal combustion engine [9]. For instance, high diffusivity is preferred to form a homogeneous mixture under high-speed conditions, extremely fast burning speed means the higher constant-volume combustion degree, shorter quenching distance helps improve the combustion efficiency, and so on [10]. The concepts of hydrogen engines were proposed in the 19th century [11]. However, due to the constraints of hydrogen supply infrastructure, hydrogen production cost, hydrogen safety and other factors, there was a vacuum of development for hydrogen engines. With the development of science and technology in recent years, however, the commercialization of hydrogen-fueled engines has gradually become possible [12]. Some researches suggested that hydrogen-enriched is also a good way to improve the performance of fossil-fueled engine. However, it can’t essentially change the emissions characteristic of engine and will lead to a complicated powertrain. Hence, pure hydrogen-fueled engine is a better option. Limited by the low specific-volume heat value of hydrogen, pure hydrogen engines have an inherent disadvantage of poor power performance. Research has been proved that compared to the gasoline engine, only 87% power can be theoretically achieved in same specs hydrogen engine [11], and about 50% for the real [13]. Besides, hydrogen tanks are usually larger than conventional fuel tanks, leading to bigger powertrains. Therefore, how to improve the power performance of the hydrogen-fueled engine with a compact structure becomes an urgent problem to be solved. In addition to the popular reciprocating piston engine, many different-typed engines had been designed and developed, one of which is called the Wankel rotary engine (WRE) [14]. WRE removes the reciprocating motion, allowing for higher speeds [15]. In addition, because the WRE has no valve mechanism, it has the advantage of low NVH and compact structure. One of the most significant advantages of WRE over piston engines is that it can achieve the power density of two-stroke under the premise of the same four-stroke operation, thus it has extremely excellent power performances [16]. The RENESIS WRE produced by Mazda with only 1.3L displacement can achieve 222 N·m maximum brake output brake and 177 kW at 8500 r/min [17]. Therefore, WRE is deemed to a suitable way of making up for the low power density of hydrogen engine, and the hydrogen is used in WRE usually be divided into pure hydrogen [18] and hydrogen-enriched modes [19]. Stutzenberger et al. [20] evaluated the suitability of hydrogen in a gasoline-fueled WRE and concluded that the power density of hydrogen-fueled WRE was comparable to that of a conventional gasoline-fueled reciprocating piston engine. Besides, they also claimed that only with a few modifications to the gasoline-fueled WRE, hydrogen could be satisfactorily used. Dai et al. [21] investigated the different fuels on the WRE and the result suggests that compared with methanol and methane, hydrogen-fueled WRE has higher power output. Morimoto et al. [13] experimentally found that hydrogen-fueled WRE achieved an output power up to 63% of the gasoline specs, while the hydrogen piston engine only has 50% power output than the gasoline specs. In addition, there are also some researches [22,23] blending hydrogen into fossil-fueled WRE, and they found that only by blending a few amounts of hydrogen, both combustion and emission performances of WRE could be significantly improved. Hydrogen-enriched is only a way to improve the emission of WRE, but not essentially change the WRE’s emission characteristic, hence, pure hydrogen-fueled WRE is better selection [24]. For the spark-ignition engine, ignition is an important part, which closely relates to the performance of the engine [25]. In the past researches, the ignition aspect is mainly to the ignition timing [26], the spark plug number [27], the spark plug position [28], the spark plug type [29] and so on. Especially for the WRE, the narrow and long combustion chamber requires an excellent ignition strategy to ensure efficient and complete combustion. Furthermore, due to the requirement of sealing, the spark plug of WRE can not be inserted into the combustion chamber and the arcing can only happen inside the cylinder. As a result, the arcing atmosphere of WRE is poorer than that of the reciprocating engine. Therefore, there is great necessity in optimizing the ignition of WRE. Su et al. respectively investigated the ignition timing of hydrogen-enrich gasoline-fueled [30] and n-butanol-fueled [31] WRE and they found that fuel propertied had a great influence on the ignition timing. Even if only a small amount of hydrogen was mixed, the ignition timing of maximum brake torque (MBT) would change significantly. K. Yamaoto et al. [32] researched the combustion characteristics of the gasoline-fueled WRE and they demonstrated that the influence of trailing spark plug on WRE knocking was greater than that of the leading spark plug, as well on pre-ignition. Jaber [33] numerically studied the hydrogen-fueled WRE and found that increasing the local mass fuel burning rate in the L-side was conducive to improving the performance of the WRE. To sum up, in the interests of size, power and emission of powertrains, hydrogen-fueled WRE can be considered an excellent choice. And the ignition is an important parameter for hydrogen-fueled WRE. Hence, there is a great interest to study the ignition on the hydrogen-fueled WRE. Past researches have concentrated chiefly on the gasoline, methane and alcohols, few of them experimentally investigated the ignition characteristic of hydrogen-fueled WRE, however, the ignition characteristic of hydrogen-fueled WRE is distinctive to other fueled WRE due to the extreme properties of hydrogen. Therefore, to provide theoretical guidance in this field, this work aims to experimentally explore the influence of the position of spark plug with varied ignition timing on the performance of the hydrogen-fueled WRE. Based on the rotation direction, leading plug is defined as the one front the minor axis, and the reverse is named trailing plug."
1,Experimental apparatus and methods,
2,Apparatus,"2.1 Apparatus A gasoline-fueled water-cooling WRE was modified to as the tested engine. The detailed specification and schematic diagram are respectively shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . To meet the experimental requirements, the gasoline supply system of the original engine was removed, and a self-designed hydrogen supply system was installed. Besides, to keep the ignition timing and fuel supply under control, a self-developed electronic control unit (ECU) replaces the original engine’s ECU. This self-developed ECU provides precise control of ignition timing and excess air ratio by transmitting the signal to the hydrogen nozzle and ignition coil. In addition, to ensure the accuracy of this work, 99.99% pure hydrogen is adopted, and the supply pressure is maintained at 5 bar. Some test facilities were used to carry out this work and test the experimental data. A smart gas box XT ZNQL-2H devised by Beijing XiaoTao Technology Co., Ltd. was applied to achieve the hydrogen supply. In this device, a thermal volumetric flow meter named Sevenstar D07-60 was adopted to measure the volumetric flow of hydrogen that was monitored by the XT JR-1 Flow ReadoutBox. Also, to ensure safety, a flame arrester was added to this device. For the air, a thermal flow meter typed Tociel 20 N060 was used to monitor the flow of air. The Powerlink CAC6 alternating current electrical dynamometer is used to measure and control the speed and brake torque of the WRE. For combustion analysis, the spark plug combining with Kistler 6117BFD17 piezoelectric pressure transducer replaced the original spark plug. The pressure signal was transmitted to the Kibox combustion analyzer. Because the original engine’s speed signal teeth trigger special and Kibox combustion could not identify it, so a 23 (24–1) teeth trigger wheel cooperating with a photoelectric magnetic sensor was mounted on the engine eccentric shaft to obtain the speed signal. The real-time excess air ratio was monitored by a Horiba MEXA-730λ wide-range lambda analyzer with an oxygen sensor inserted into the exhaust pipe. The NO emission was measured by the Horiba MEXA-7100DEGR emissions analyzer. The schematic diagram of the experiment system and the parameters, sensitivity and measurement uncertainties of these above facilities are respectively displayed in Fig. 2 and Table 2 ."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods The influence of trailing plug (T-plug mode) and leading plug (L-plug mode) under varied ignition timing on the combustion and emission performance of hydrogen-fueled WRE is investigated. Hereinafter, the T-plug mode represents adopting the trailing plug as the spark plug, and the L-plug mode represents adopting the leading plug as the spark plug. The locations of these two spark plugs have been shown in Fig. 1. Considering the existence of abnormal combustion, to ensure the experiment is not affected by it, the operating conditions are chosen as 1500r/min and 66 kPa manifold absolute pressure (MAP). And the ignition timing of the trailing plug is tested from −35°CA after top dead center (ATDC, TDC represents top dead center) to 0°CA ATDC with 5°CA intervals and that of leading plug is tested from −20°CA ATDC to 20°CA ATDC with 5°CA intervals as well. The difference in ignition timing between two spark plug is due to when trailing plug sparks at ATDC under tested conditions, the engine can’t operate stably. Hence, all ignition timings of the trailing plug are earlier than TDC. The leading plug, however, can make the engine operate stably when sparks later than TDC, therefore, the ignition timing of the leading plug is changed from −20°CA ATDC to 20°CA ATDC. The warm-up was carried out before the experiment to ensure the same cooling loss during the experiment. The temperature of cooling water is adjusted by a thermostat, which guarantees 82 °C cooling water. After the warming up, the intake temperature was maintained at 21 °C which depends on the balance of ambient temperature and operating conditions of WRE. After the warming up, adjusted the dynamometer to n/P gear to limit the engine speed at 1500 r/min and then adjusted the accelerator executor to make MAP to 66 kPa. At the same time, the excess air ratio was maintained at 1.5 by adjusting the amount of hydrogen supply. These three parameters were kept constant during the total tested process. The ignition timing was adjusted by the control software of self-developed ECU. Under each tested ignition timing of both spark plugs, in-cylinder pressures for 300 continuous cycles were recorded as well as average hydrogen consumption rates and emissions. The excess air ratio (λ) is defined as: (1) λ = 0.2095 ∗ V air / 0.5 ∗ V H2 In Eq. (1), Vair is the volume flow rate (SLM) of the air; VH2 is the volume flow rate (SLM) of hydrogen."
4,Error analysis,"2.3 Error analysis Experimental error and uncertainties mainly come from setup, condition, calibration, reading and test methods. The error analysis of the experiment needs to be carried out to prove the reliability of the data. The uncertainties of experimental setups have been listed in Table 2. The whole percentage uncertainty causing by various variables based on [34] is estimated as 0.65%, and the specific calculation method is as follows: Overall experimental uncertainty = Square root of [(uncertainty of speed)2+ (uncertainty of torque)2+ (uncertainty of NO)2+ (uncertainty of in-cylinder pressure)2 + (uncertainty of excess air ratio)2] = Square root of [0.42 + 0.42 + 0.12 + 0.32 + 0.0072] = 0.65%"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Cyclic variation,"3.1 Cyclic variation The cyclic variation is a significant parameter of the engine. Low cyclic variation is conducive to reducing the maximum in-cylinder pressure and pollutant emissions, and improving compression ratio. In this work, the cyclic variation of peak in-cylinder pressure is chosen to represent the cyclic variation, and it is defined as: (2) COV Pmax = ∑ 1 300 P i - P - 2 i - 1 P - ∗ 100 \% In Eq. (2), Pi is the peak pressure of the ith cycles, i is the cycle number, P - is the average peak pressure of 300 continuous cycles. Fig. 3 shows the cyclic variation of peak in-cylinder pressure (hereinafter referred to as cyclic variation) of two modes under varied ignition timing. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that with the delay of ignition timing, cyclic variations of both modes gradually increase. For the L-plug mode, when the ignition timing is retarded from −20°CA ATDC to 20°CA ATDC, the cyclic variation increases from 6.86% to 14.38%, an increase of 109%. The reason is that with delaying the ignition timing, the total combustion process gradually far away from TDC, which indicates that flame needs to propagate in a bigger combustion chamber. With constant fuel, a longer flame path means increased cooling losses [35] and increased variability [36]. Especially, when the ignition timing is later than TDC, the cyclic variation rapidly increases with delaying it. It may be explained by the fact that the volumetric change rate of the WRE with the crank angle is nonlinear, and the volumetric change rate corresponding to the combustion process increases rapidly with extremely delayed ignition timing, leading to the higher cyclic variation. Compared to the two modes, when the ignition timing is retarded, the cyclic variation of the T-plug mode gradually exceeds that of the L-plug mode. This is because that when the ignition timing is earlier than TDC, the fuel mainly gathers around the trailing side of the combustion chamber, namely the trailing plug side, therefore, the flame has a shorter propagating path, while for the L-plug mode, the flame needs to propagate to the trailing side and then release heat intensively. As the ignition timing is delayed, the fuel is squeezed into the front side, namely the leading plug side, hence, the cyclic variation of L-plug mode is gradually lower than that of T-plug mode."
7,Combustion analysis,"3.2 Combustion analysis Fig. 4 is the CA0-10 of two modes under varied ignition timing. Generally, CA0-10 is used to represent the stage of flame development. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that when the ignition timing is retarded from BTDC to TDC, CA0-10 of both modes gradually shorten, while the CA0-10 of L-plug mode basically increases as delaying the ignition timing from TDC to ATDC. Besides, L-plug mode can achieve shorter CA0-10 in their respective operating range, the shortest CA0-10 of L-plug mode is obtained at 5°CA ATDC. The reason is that the formation of the flame kernel is closely related to the temperature [37] and pressure [38] of the surrounding environment. At TDC, the temperature and pressure in the combustion chamber are higher than that of other crank angles, which means that a better thermal atmosphere is provided to prompt the flame development. Therefore, the shortest CA0-10 is realized when ignition timing is near TDC. When at TDC, however, the extremely high surface-to-volume ratio of WRE leads to a high cooling loss, which is not conducive to flame development. Hence, the shortest CA0-10 occurs near TDC but not to TDC. Comparing the T-plug mode and L-plug mode, when ignition timing is between −20°CA ATDC and TDC, L-plug mode has a longer CA0-10 than T-plug mode, and the difference is gradually shortened with delaying ignition timing. It may be accounted for by the following reason: when the ignition timing is earlier than TDC, the volume of the leading-side combustion chamber is so smallthat results in a higher cooling loss and a poorer flow field movement near leading plug. Therefore, L-plug mode has a longer CA0-10 than T-plug mode in this situation. As the ignition timing gets closer to the TDC, the better thermal atmosphere near the leading plug is gradually conducive to the flame development, while the opposite happens in T-plug mode, hence the CA0-10 difference between the two modes is gradually reduced. CA10-90 of two modes under varied ignition timing is shown in Fig. 5 . It can be observed from Fig. 5 that the CA10-90 of both modes basically show a trend of shortening with delaying ignition timing. This is maybe explained by the fact that for T-plug mode, with the delay of ignition timing, the shortened CA0-10 of T-plug mode leads to the flame development occurs in a smaller space, thus providing a better thermal atmosphere for the subsequent combustion process. Therefore, a shortened CA10-90 is obtained as retarding ignition timing. For the L-plug mode, when the ignition timing is earlier than TDC, the reason is similar to that of T-plug mode. And when the ignition timing is later than the TDC, although the CA0-10 is prolonged as delaying ignition timing, more fuel is squeezed into the leading plug side, which means that a shorter flame propagation path achieves a shorter CA10-90. This reason also applies to sparks before TDC in L-plug mode. It also can be found that when igniting at the same time, T-plug mode has a shorter CA10-90 than L-plug mode. This is due to when the ignition timing is earlier than TDC, the volume of the combustion chamber in the trailing side is bigger than that in the leading side, which means that for T-plug mode, the flame doesn’t need to propagate to the side far from the trailing plug, while for the L-plug mode, the contrary is the case. As a consequence, the T-plug mode has a shorter CA10-90 than the L-plug mode. Fig. 6 illustrates the CA50 of two modes under varied ignition timing. It can be concluded that both CA50 of the two modes are gradually retarded with delayed ignition timing. The reason is that although the CA0-10 and CA10-90 will shorten at the partial range when the ignition timing is delayed, the time of spark plays a dominant role in CA50. As a result, delayed ignition timing makes the combustion process appear later, resulting in a delayed CA50. Besides, when the ignition timing locates between −20°CA ATDC to TDC, the CA50 of L-plug mode is later than that of T-plug mode. The reason is that T-plug mode has a shorter CA0-10 and CA10-90 than L-plug mode, therefore, when the same ignition timing is adopted, the CA0-50 of T-plug mode is shorter than that of L-plug mode, that is, T-plug mode has an advanced CA50. It also can be seen with the delay of ignition timing, the CA50 difference between the two modes gradually decreases. Especially, when sparks at TDC, the CA50 difference of two modes is less than 2°CA. Fig. 7 presents the average in-cylinder pressure of L-plug mode with crank angle under varied ignition timing. Because the tendencies of in-cylinder pressure in both modes under varied ignition timing are similar, and the tested range of ignition timing of L-plug mode include ATDC and BTDC, its in-cylinder pressure is more representative, so only the in-cylinder pressure curve of L-plug mode is presented. In the next part (Fig. 8 ), the peak in-cylinder pressure of L-plug mode and T-plug mode will be comparatively studied. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that with the delay of ignition timing, the peak in-cylinder pressure gradually decreases and the corresponding crank angle is retarded. When the ignition timing is retarded from −20 to 20°CA ATDC, the peak in-cylinder pressure reduces from 17.62 bar to 11.23 bar and the corresponding crank angle is retarded from 21.8°CA ATDC to 55.2°CA ATDC. It can be explained by the fact that as delaying the ignition timing, the total combustion process is retarded, therefore, the crank angle corresponding to the peak in-cylinder pressure appears later. Besides, the combustion process gradually far away from TDC, peculiarly when the ignition timing is later than TDC, the total combustion process occurs on the work stroke, which means that the same amounts heat is released in a bigger space, resulting in lower peak pressure. Especially, when the ignition timing is 20°CA ATDC, the peak in-cylinder is only 11.23 bar, a little higher than the towing in-cylinder pressure, indicating that a too delayed ignition timing is not conducive to the engine. Fig. 8 is the peak in-cylinder pressure and corresponding crank angle of two modes under varied ignition timing. It can be seen that with the delay of ignition timing, the peak in-cylinder pressures of both modes decrease with a retarded corresponding crank angle. The reason has been explained in the previous section and will not be repeated here. By comparing the two modes, it can be concluded that when the ignition timing is retarded from −20°CA ATDC to TDC, the peak in-cylinder pressure of L-plug mode gradually exceeds that of T-plug mode, and the corresponding crank angle of L-plug mode also becomes earlier than that of T-plug mode. The peak in-cylinder pressure of T-plug mode reduces from 19.86 bar to 14.64 bar, while that of L-plug mode reduces from 17.62 bar to 15.44 bar, when ignition timing is retarded from −20°CA ATDC to TDC. The specific reasons are as follows: when the ignition timing is earlier than the TDC, the combustion chamber in the trailing side is larger, where most of fuels are concentrated. As a result, when adopts the leading plug as the spark plug, the flame needs to propagate from the leading side to the trailing side and then the heat is released intensively, leading to a period similar to the “ignition delay period”. The existence of this period makes the heat-releasing process of L-plug mode longer than that of T-plug mode, resulting in lower in-cylinder pressure. With the delay of ignition timing, however, more fuels are squeezed into the leading side, which indicates that the period similar to the “ignition delay period” of L-plug mode is shortened, while that of T-plug mode is lengthened. Fig. 9 displays the brake torque of two modes under varied ignition timing. When the ignition timing is earlier than TDC, the brake torques of two modes increases as delaying the ignition timing, and for the L-plug mode, when the ignition timing is later than TDC, the brake torques decreases as delaying the ignition timing. Besides, the maximum brake torques of both modes are obtained when ignites as TDC. It may be explained by the following reasons: hydrogen has extremely fast combustion speed, even if at a slightly lean condition [39]. The extremely fast combustion speed means that when adopts a too early ignition timing, lots of heat are released in the compression stroke, which signifies that part of the fuel does negative work, resulting in a waste of energy, thus obtaining a low brake torque. When adopts a too late ignition timing, the combustion occurs on a bigger combustion chamber space, which means that the combustion has a lower constant-volume combustion degree, therefore, resulting in a reducing brake torque. In summary, for the hydrogen-fueled WRE, whether either spark plug is adopted, it is necessary to balance the “trade-off” relationship between in-cylinder pressure and the combustion phase. Besides, it also can be concluded that when a certain ignition timing is given, adopting the leading plug can realize higher brake torque than adopting the trailing plug. When ignites at TDC, L-plug mode achieves 36.0 N·m brake torque, while T-plug mode is only 31.2 N·m, about 87% of L-plug mode. This is because that relative to the direction of rotor rotation, the trailing plug is located at the back of the minor axis as shown in Fig. 1, which has some inhibition effect on the rotor rotation at the early stage of combustion. Especially when the ignition is too early. While the leading plug is located at the front of the minor axis, which means that the combustion from the leading plug basically does the positive work, unless premature ignition causes the flame to spread to the rear side of the minor axis before the rotor rotates to TDC, causing negative work. In addition, the changing rate of brake torque in L-plug mode is smaller than that of T-plug mode, which is also conducive to restrain abnormal combustion of hydrogen-fueled WRE by adjusting ignition timing, although this work is carried out under the condition of normal combustion. To sum up, in terms of power performance, the leading plug is more suitable for hydrogen-fueled WRE than the trailing plug. In the research [40], however, the single spark plug of gasoline-fueled WRE is located at the rear side of the minor axis, which means that the different physiochemical properties between gasoline and hydrogen make a marked difference in the selection of spark plug position."
8,Untreated emission,"3.3 Untreated emission Significantly different from the fossil-fueled engine, the hydrogen-fueled engine has simpler pollutant emission, just NOx [41], excluding HC, CO, CO2 and soot emissions. Undeniably, due to the use of lubricating oil, a little carbon-based emission exists in the hydrogen-fueled engine. Nonetheless, the research [42] has been reported that oil consumption in modern passenger car engines is usually less than 0.05%, therefore, the carbon-based can be neglected. Besides, the major component in NOx emission is NO [43], hence, in this part, only the NO emission is be presented. Fig. 10 shows the NO emission of two modes under varied ignition timing. It can be found from this figure that the NO emission of both two modes significantly decreases with delaying the ignition timing. It can be interpreted by the reason that the peak in-cylinder pressure of two modes reduces as retarding the ignition timing under the tested range as shown in Fig. 7, and in the combustion process engine, the in-cylinder temperature positively relates to the in-cylinder pressure, that is, the thermal atmosphere gradually becomes poor with the delay of ignition timing. Besides, the formation of thermal NO closely relates to the two factors, temperature [44] and oxygen content [45]. Therefore, combining the two aspects, the amount of NO emission shows a reducing tendency as delaying the ignition timing. Moreover, at the same ignition timing, T-plug mode has higher NO emissions than L-plug mode. It is mainly due to when the ignition timing is between −20°CA ATDC and TDC, T-plug mode has a faster combustion speed, resulting in higher in-cylinder pressure, as shown in Figs. 5 and 8. That is, a higher in-cylinder temperature is obtained in the T-plug mode, therefore, a higher NO emission is realized in the T-plug mode rather than L-plug mode. However, this work is carried out under the lean combustion condition with an excess air ratio of 1.5, the lower combustion temperature is not enough to support the production of NO in large quantities. Within the tested range, the maximum NO emission is only about 200 ppm. Besides, when the MBT ignition timing is adopted, the NO emissions of two modes are 0, which indicates that NO emission will not be a factor limiting the power performance of the hydrogen-fueled WRE under lean combustion conditions."
9,Conclusions,"A modified Wankel rotary engine is used to comparatively investigate the difference of trailing plug and leading plug under varied ignition timing on the combustion and emission performance of hydrogen-fueled Wankel rotary engine. This study is carried out under the condition of 1500r/min, 66 kPa manifold absolute pressure and 1.5 excess air ratio. The specific conclusions are as follows: 1. With the delay of ignition timing, regardless of trailing or leading plug is adopted, the peak in-cylinder pressure cyclic variation gradually increases. Comparing the two spark plug, when ignites at the same time, the cyclic variation of the trailing plug gradually exceeds that of the leading plug, but the difference is not big. 2. With the delay of ignition timing, CA0-10 of adopting leading plug decrease first and then increase, while the CA10-90 gradually decreases. Comparing two spark plugs, adopting the trailing plug can obtain shorter CA0-10 and CA10-90 under the same ignition timing. Besides, within the tested range adopting the trailing plug can realize the earlier CA50 than adopting the leading plug, but the difference decreases as delaying the ignition timing. 3. With the delay of ignition timing, regardless of trailing or leading plug is adopted, the peak in-cylinder gradually decreases and the corresponding crank angle is retarded. Comparing two spark plugs, with delaying the ignition timing, the peak in-cylinder of adopting leading plug gradually exceeds that of adopting trailing plug, which means when an earlier ignition timing is adopted, trailing plug has a better effect, and vice versa. 4. With the delay of ignition timing, the brake torque of adopting leading plug first increases and then decreases, and both maximum brake torque ignition timings are at the top dead center. Comparing with two sparks plugs, adopting the leading plug can achieve higher brake torque, namely higher efficiency. 5. With the delay of ignition timing, regardless of trailing or leading plug is adopted, the NO emission gradually decreases. Comparing two spark plugs, adopting the trailing plug will result in higher NO emissions. However, this work is under lean-combustion condition, the maximum amount of NO emission is only about 200 ppm, and the NO emission corresponding to maximum brake torque ignition timing is 0 under both spark plugs. In summary, compared to the trailing plug, the leading plug is more suitable as the spark plug of the hydrogen-fueled Wankel rotary engine, which can realize a wider ignition range, higher brake torque, lower cyclic variation and NO emission. This is different from the traditional gasoline-fueled rotary engine, which is preferred to trailing spark plug. However, this work is only aimed at a single operating condition, in our future work, more positions of leading plug and more operating conditions will be further explored."
