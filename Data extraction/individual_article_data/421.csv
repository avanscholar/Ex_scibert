0,Introduction,"Oxo synthesis is one of the most important industrial petrochemical processes. The key stage of oxo process is hydroformylation – the reaction of unsaturated compounds with syngas leading to aldehydes used for the production of alcohols, acids, amines, esters, and other compounds. The oxo process’ worldwide production is approximately 11 million tons per year [1]. About 50 valuable chemicals are produced via this process, which are in high demand in such products as plasticizers, detergents, solvents, agrochemicals and in the food industry. Hydroformylation can be used for a wide range of substrates, from ethylene to higher olefins and oleochemicals [2–4]. Among the most frequent industrial processes used for the aldehydes obtained by hydroformylation is transformation into the corresponding alcohols. Hydrogenation is often conducted as a separate stage. Many researchers make an effort to develop catalytic systems for one-step production of alcohols from unsaturated compounds; the direct and selective conversion of terminal olefins to n-alcohols (reductive hydroformylation, or tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation) is a very useful and promising reaction. It avoids construction of a separate hydrogenation unit, and a decrease in capital investment, making the process more economically attractive. This process, which enables the integration of hydroformylation and aldehyde hydrogenation stages already exists in industry (Shell process [5]); it is based on the use of a classical cobalt/phosphine catalytic system and characterized by C7-C14 olefin to alcohol conversion of about 80 %. However, the current version requires high pressures and temperatures (160–200 °C, 5.0–10.0 MPa), and the yield of side products is comparatively high. So, the search for new, more effective systems for the process continues, with some promising results. The different performances of the catalytic systems on the basis of rhodium, cobalt, palladium, and ruthenium with typical organic ligands, reaction conditions, and selected applications are completely described in a review [6]. More recently, homogeneous Ru [7] and Rh/Ru bimetallic catalytic systems [8,9] were investigated in tandem reductive hydroformylation. Several new heterogeneous systems were also reported [10,11]. It should be noted, that alcohols can be obtained via hydroformylation as the main product when alternative CO sources, like methyl formate, formaldehyde, formic acid, CO/H2O, and CO2/H2 mixtures are used [12–16]. Rhodium complexes with tertiary amines [15–22] are also known to catalyze tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation. The interaction of rhodium with tertiary nitrogen in the ligand sphere enhances the activity of catalytic centers in aldehyde hydrogenation. Jurewicz and co-workers [17] found polymeric material with N,N-dimethylbenzylamine fragments (anion exchange resin) to be an effective support for Rh tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation catalysts, starting a series of works aimed at heterogenization of the process, which is of great importance for easier separation and recycling [23]. The catalysts based on it were studied in several further works [24–27] and showed exceptional stability among other polymer-based catalysts [25,28]. The development of the idea led to the design of silica/tertiary amine-supported Rh catalysts for the process [29,30]. They demonstrated higher alcohol selectivity than the catalyst supported by N,N-dimethylbenzylamine-containing polymer being tested under comparatively mild conditions (100 °C, 7 MPa) [30]. However, silica-based N-containing catalysts (supported by SIL-CH2-CH2-CH2-NR2 materials) are characterized by considerable Rh leaching [29]. The combination of the advantages of silica-based heterogeneous catalysts with a higher stability would be desirable progress in this field. The approach to this challenge described here is the use of mesoporous silica with anchored N-containing polymers providing a specific microenvironment for Rh active centers due to the high concentration of nitrogen atoms. We report the design of new heterogeneous rhodium catalysts based on the materials BP-1 and WP-1, where poly(allylamine) and poly(ethyleneimine) chains, respectively, are anchored on an amorphous silica gel surface."
1,Experimental,
2,BP-1-NMe2 and WP-1-NMe2 synthesis,"2.1 BP-1-NMe2 and WP-1-NMe2 synthesis The initial material (BP-1 or WP-1, 0.600 g) was put into a round-bottom flask (25 ml) equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The flask was placed into a cold water bath. The mixture of formic acid (95 %, 3 ml) and water (0.3 mL) was added. In the case of BP-1, the bubbles could be observed at this stage, for WP-1 they were not detected. Next, formaldehyde (37 % water solution, 3 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min on cooling. Further, it was refluxed for 7 h and then stirred at room temperature overnight. After reaction, the mixture was centrifuged; the solid product was decanted and washed with methanol (2 × 10 ml). The resulting white powder was suspended in dichloromethane and dried in vacuum to yield 0.490 g (for BP-1) or 0.460 g (for WP-1) of methylated support in the form of white powder."
3,Rh(acac)(CO)2 synthesis,"2.2 Rh(acac)(CO)2 synthesis Rh(acac)(CO) 2 was prepared as described in [31]. RhCl3*3H 2 O (1.07 g, 0.35 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (20 mL), then freshly distilled acetylacetone (4 mL, 39 mmol) was added. The solution was refluxed for 30 min. Further, it was cooled to the room temperature, and cold water (50 mL) was added. Red precipitate was filtered out and washed with water and ethanol. Then the complex was recrystallized from hexane. Red-green dichroic crystals were obtained (0.72 g, yield 75 %), mp = 154–155 °C. IR: 2085 cm−1, 1987 cm−1."
4,KR and KS synthesis,"2.3 KR and KS synthesis BP-1 or WP-1 (0.400 g) and Rh(acac)(CO) 2 (0.095 g, 0.37 mmol) were placed into a round-bottom flask (25 ml) equipped with a magnetic stirrer, then dichloromethane (5 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. For BP-1 (KR synthesis) the mixture was yellow during the reaction. In the case of WP-1 (KS synthesis), the color change was dedicated: initially yellow mixture turned orange (in 5 min), and further became dark brown (in 3 h). After reaction, the solid product was separated by centrifugation and washed with dichloromethane (2 × 10 mL). Next, it was dispersed in dichloromethane and dried in vacuum. KS became lighter as it dried and turned to dark yellow. Both catalysts (0.365 g of KR and 0.370 g of KS) were obtained as yellow powders."
5,KN and KW synthesis,"2.4 KN and KW synthesis BP-1-NMe 2 or WP-1-NMe 2 (0.400 g) and Rh(acac)(CO) 2 (0.095 g, 0.37 mmol) were placed into a round-bottom flask (25 mL) equipped with a magnetic stirrer, then dichloromethane (5 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. In both cases, a color change was detected: the initially yellow mixture turned orange (in 0.5 h), and further became dark brown (in 3 h). After reaction, the solid product was separated by centrifugation and washed with dichloromethane (2 × 10 mL). Next, it was dispersed in dichloromethane and dried in vacuum. Both catalysts became lighter as they dried, K N was obtained as a light brown powder (0.360 g), and K W – as a yellow one (0.350 g)."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization IR spectra of the materials were taken with a Nicolet IR2000 (Thermo Scientific) instrument using multiple distortions of the total internal reflection method with multi-reflection HATR accessories, containing a 45° ZnSe crystal for different wavelengths with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The spectrum was taken by averaging 100 scans. The structures of catalysts were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with an LAS-3000 instrument equipped with a OPX-150 photoelectron retarding-potential analyzer. For photoelectron excitation, aluminium anode radiation (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV) was used at a tube voltage of 12 kV and an emission current 20 mA. Photoelectron peaks were calibrated with reference to the carbon C1s corresponding to a binding energy of 285 eV. The TEM study was done using FEI’s Tecnai Osiris TEM equipped with X-FEG gun at 200 keV. High angle annular dark field (HAADF) with EDX elemental mapping was used to identify the composition of the samples. Nitrogen desorption/desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K with a Micromeritics Gemini VII 2390 instrument (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, United States). All samples were degassed at 120 °C for 12 h before measurement. The surface area (SBET) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on adsorption data in the relative pressure range P/P0 = 0.05–0.2. The total pore volume (Vtot) was determined by the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.995. Quantitative determination of rhodium in the samples was performed by ICP AES methods using an IRIS Interpid II XPL spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., USA) at the wavelength 343.49 nm. Percentage of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen was determined by elemental analysis on a Vario Microcube Elementar instrument. The samples were combusted at 950 °C using helium as a carrier gas (flow rate 120 mL/min). The separation of the products (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water) was carried out on a thermal desorption column of the device in a helium flow, using a thermal conductivity detector. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was carried out using a Mettler Toledo instrument TGA/DSC1 in air flow (70 mL/min) at the heating rate 10 °C/min from 30 to 1000 °C. The accuracy of the temperature measurement was ±0.3 °C. The results were analyzed with the service program STARe."
7,Catalytic experiments,"2.6 Catalytic experiments A typical procedure for tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation of octene-1 was conducted as follows. A stainless steel autoclave (20 mL) equipped with a manometer and a magnetic stirrer was charged with KN (30 mg), octene-1 (0.6 mL, 4 mmol), and toluene (2 mL). The autoclave was sealed, purged with hydrogen, and then consequently pressurized with hydrogen to 3.0 MPa and syngas (CO:H2 = 1:1) to a total pressure 6.0 MPa. The mixture was stirred in an oil bath at 80 °C for 5 h. After reaction, the reactor was cooled down and depressurized. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, the liquid phase was removed and analyzed by GLC. The catalyst was washed with toluene (2 mL), separated by centrifugation, and reused under the same conditions. Liquid products were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a Khromos chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 50-m-long capillary column coated with the DB-5 phase using temperature programming of 60–230 °C and helium as a carrier gas."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterization,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization For the synthesis of the heterogeneous catalysts, silica composites BP-1 and WP-1 were used. These materials (Fig. 1 ) combine a high density of functional groups with the rigidity of the silica gel matrix [32–36]; they can be applied in the mining industry for the removal of contaminating metals from liquid waste streams [37] and in catalysis [38–41]. In BP-1, poly(allylamine) chains are anchored on an amorphous silica gel surface. For WP-1, polymeric constituent is poly(ethyleneimine) (Fig. 1). As mentioned above, according to the literature, rhodium complexes with tertiary alkyl amines are exclusively active in aldehyde hydrogenation [17–22]. For this reason, we modified terminal amino groups of initial materials to obtain methylated supports BP-1-NMe2 and WP-1-NMe2 (Scheme 1 ). One more reason for such a modification is a possible reaction between unmodified primary amino groups and aldehydes obtained during the catalytic process, which would change the microenvironment of rhodium and impact catalytic activity. In Table 1 , the results of elemental analysis of starting materials and supports obtained are shown. In both cases, carbon and hydrogen content increased after modification. For BP-1, the molar increase in hydrogen content is 2.2 times more than that of carbon (in theory, it should be 2 times when amino groups get methylated). However, for WP-1 this ratio is bigger (about 3); probably, some solvent stayed unremoved after the synthesis. The surface area analysis showed that both initial and modified materials can be classified as mesoporous (Table 2 ). The modification doesn’t change the surface area drastically, and pore size remains unchanged. To obtain the two rhodium catalysts KN and KW, modified supports BP-1-NMe2 and WP-1-NMe2, respectively, were suspended in dichloromethane. Next, Rh(acac)(CO)2 was added (1 mol Rh per 2 mol N), and the mixtures were stirred for 12 h at room temperature. In the beginning, the mixtures were light yellow, but in 0.5 h they became orange. Then, they get darker and turned brown in 3 h. After reaction, the catalysts were isolated by centrifugation, washed twice with dichloromethane, and dried in vacuum, becoming lighter as they dried. Two solid products were obtained: KN as a light brown powder and KW as a yellow one. In order to confirm that methylation of BP-1 and WP-1 amino groups’ at the first stage is crucial for the performance of the resulting catalysts, we also treated unmodified BP-1 and WP-1 with Rh(acac)(CO)2 in dichloromethane by the procedure described above. In the case of BP-1, the suspension was yellow for all the 12 h of stirring, and the yellow powder KR was obtained after washing and drying. The mixture of WP-1 and Rh(acac)(CO)2 was undergoing the same color changes as for BP-1-NMe2 and WP-1-NMe2, so we can suggest that they are related to the presence of tertiary nitrogen atoms in the material (WP-1 initially contains some (30 %), while BP-1 doesn’t). The final product obtained from unmodified WP-1 was a yellow powder KS. The ICP-AES data on Rh content in the four catalysts is shown in Table 3 . In all samples, about 2 % of Rh was found. Methylation of amino groups doesn’t result in a significant change in Rh content. To indicate the interaction between Rh and nitrogen atoms of the support, we conducted a model experiment. We used PEI (average Mw∼25,000, branched, Sigma-Aldrich) as a soluble analog of heterogeneous supports and Rh(acac)(CO)2 as Rh source. These compounds (taken in 1:1 M N:Rh ratio) were solved in DMSO-d6 and mixed for 1 h at 60 ℃. Right after dissolution, the mixture became green and then changed its color to yellow. After it was cooled, the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture was registered. In the spectrum of PEI, broadened multiplet in 2.38–2.54 ppm region (CH2 protons) and broadened signal at 2.70–3.70 (NH and NH2 protons) can be observed. The spectrum of Rh(acac)(CO)2 has one main signal – singlet at 3.37 ppm – which corresponds to protons of CH3 groups of acetylacetonate anion bonded with rhodium. After the model reaction, the spectrum of the mixture contains both the signals of individual acetylacetone (two tautomers) and acetylacetonate anion. This indicates that the anion was partly displaced from the Rh coordination sphere. At the same time, the signals of the ion are slightly shifted compared to original Rh(acac)(CO)2 spectrum (3.33 vs 3.37 ppm). This shift is most probably caused by the interaction between Rh center and nitrogen atoms. Another evidence of this interaction is the lack of the signals of initial polymer in the spectrum. All NMR spectra are given in the SI, p.23-25."
10,Catalytic study,"3.2 Catalytic study Tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation of octene-1 was studied as a model reaction to optimize reaction conditions. Octene-1 molecular transformations observed are shown in Scheme 2 . In Table 4 , conversions and selectivities to alcohols and aldehydes in the presence of catalysts KN, KW, KR, and KS are compared with those in homogeneous rhodium-containing systems. In ligand-free system, no alcohol formation can be observed. In classical Rh/PPh3 one only traces of nonanol-1 were found. The addition of tertiary amine leads to hydrogenation of aldehydes. Both KN and KW appear to be more selective to alcohols than homogeneous analog. In all the cases where alcohols are obtained n:iso ratio for them exceeds this for aldehydes. It can be explained by the difference between n- and iso-aldehyde reactivities. Total n-product selectivities for supported catalysts (n:iso ratio about 2) are also close to Rh/TMPDA homogeneous system. KN and KW have the same hydroformylation activity (characterized by total yield of aldehydes and alcohols), but KW is more active in alcohol formation, probably due to the higher tertiary nitrogen number in the support structure. The hydroformylation yield and regioselectivity over KR synthesized from unmodified BP-1 are very close to those possessed by KN, and the aldehyde yield doesn’t change from the first use to the second. At the same time, both KN and KW are significantly more effective in aldehyde hydrogenation than KR and KS, which proves that for tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation the modification of starting materials was favorable. At the next step, we studied temperature effect on tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation of octene-1 over the KN catalyst. The catalyst stability can be significantly influenced by temperature, so we used every portion of KN twice at each temperature (first run and recycle) (Fig. 2 ). At 60 °C, total conversion of octene-1 after 5 h is about 30–35 % in both reactions. For higher temperatures, it reaches 98–100 %. Oxygenate selectivity (a sum of all aldehyde and alcohol selectivities) increases with increasing temperature, but hydrogenation of aldehydes obtained apparently has an optimum value in the studied temperature range. Probably, deactivation of hydrogenation centers occurs at high temperatures (120–140 °C), whereas hydroformylation selectivity doesn’t fall under the examined conditions. An increase in temperature also promotes a decline in alcohol yields from the first use to the second. So, we observe no maxima coincidence between the “first” and “reused” curves: in the first cycle, the best alcohol selectivity is achieved at 100 °C, while in the second run the selectivity significantly decreases at this temperature. At 80 °C, the yield is sufficient, and no loss in alcohol selectivity is observed after the first use. For this reason, we have chosen temperature of 80 °C for our further experiments. The effect of syngas pressure and composition on alcohol selectivity is illustrated in Fig. 3 . It can be concluded that the general pressure of syngas is more critical for alcohol yields than CO:H2 ratio. At the same time, total oxygenate selectivity decreases with reduction in CO partial pressure. We observe that an excess of hydrogen promotes octene hydrogenation resulting in the growth of octane content in the reaction products at CO:H2 ratios 1:2 and 1:3 compared with 1:1 at the same total pressure values, which can explain the drop of oxygenate selectivity by about 10 % in both cases. However, the percentage of aldehydes undergoing hydrogenation rises as hydrogen content in syngas increases, so no loss in the final yield of alcohols can be noted. Regioselectivity of hydroformylation declines with an increase in pressure. To investigate the role of CO and H2 in the two stages of the tandem reaction, we conducted a series of hydrogenation experiments: in the presence of KN, octene-1 and nonanal were treated with hydrogen. Also, the action of syngas on nonanal was studied (Table 5 ). Hydrogen readily reacts with octene-1 over KN in the absence of CO. It is worth mentioning that toluene used as a solvent was partly hydrogenated in the system (about 7 % of toluene transformed to methylcyclohexane). We have never observed this process in other entries, neither with syngas nor with nonanal and hydrogen. Probably, the catalyst is specifically active toward CC double bonds and even aromatic compound hydrogenation when no carbon monoxide or other carbonyl group (e.g. aldehyde) can interact with rhodium. Also, this may be connected to the formation of Rh nanoparticles under CO-free conditions, which are able to catalyze hydrogenation of aromatic compounds [42]. The inhibition of CC double bond hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in the Rh/NEt3 system with CO added is described in [43]. On the contrary, hydrogen in the absence of CO is far less effective in nonanal hydrogenation than syngas, which also corresponds to data for cinnamaldehyde obtained in [43]. It confirms the conventional point of view that in systems of the type, hydrocarbonyl rhodium complexes with tertiary amine ligands catalyze an aldehyde to alcohol transformation [20]. Next, different solvents were tested as a reaction media for octene-1 hydroformylation/hydrogenation (Fig. 4 ). The highest alcohol selectivity is achieved in THF. Nonanol-1 is the main product in both cycles, however, its yield decreased after the first use. The analogous drop occurs in ethanol and heptane, while in toluene the yields of alcohols are almost the same in the first and second uses. In a solvent-free system alcohol molar yields are comparable to yields obtained in the presence of solvents. Total n:iso ratios are close to those in non-polar solvents, and undoubtedly the ratios for alcohols will also decrease if the reaction continues. The time dependence profile of the reaction is presented in Fig. 5 . Firstly, octene-1 content declines as it transforms into aldehydes, undergoes isomerization, or hydrogenation. At 1,5 h the amount of aldehydes reaches a peak and then falls with their conversion to alcohols. Nonanal reacts with hydrogen more readily than its isomer, but after 12 h the contents of two C9 alcohols are almost equal, and the yield reaches 92 %. Most of the rest is octane formed in the first three hours, also some sterically-hindered iso-aldehydes stay untransformed (about 3 % of the product mixture). As it shown in Table 6 , KN was successfully used for tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation of various unsaturated substrates. Hexene-1 converts to C7 alcohols with selectivity close to that observed for hydroformylation/hydrogenation of octene-1. For styrene and cyclohexene, the corresponding alcohols are the main products, as well as for the model substrate. Due to electronic effects, hydroformylation of styrene leads to branched aldehyde (2-phenylpropanal) predominantly [44], so 2-phenylpropanol prevails among oxygenates obtained. Surprisingly, although the conversion of ethylene to propanal is as high as 70 %, propanol-1 cannot be produced under the same conditions in sufficient yield. It may be connected to the lower solubility of propanal in toluene compared to aldehydes produced from the other unsaturated substrates in Table 6, which leads to complications in propanal transfer to active sites of the catalyst. KN and KW were tested in 5 consequent reactions (octene-1 hydroformylation/hydrogenation) at 80 °C (Fig. 6 ). In both cases, total oxygenate yield was consistently high, but alcohol selectivity gradually decreased. However, for KN this process was slower than for KW. Hydroformylation regioselectivity remained constant with an n:iso ratio of about 2.0."
11,Study of the changes in KN catalyst structure,"3.3 Study of the changes in KN catalyst structure As KN demonstrated the most stable activity in tandem hydroformylation/hydrogenation, we selected it to investigate its structure by XPS, IR, EDS mapping, and high-resolution TEM. To indicate a possible change in the structure of KN during the reaction, it was also studied after nine sequential reactions. We took a bigger amount of catalyst for this series (120 mg), and the loading of octene-1 and toluene was enlarged to 2 and 4 mL, respectively (T = 80 °C, p = 6.0 MPa (CO:H2 = 1:3), t = 5 h for each reaction). The syngas pressure declined rapidly with such a big loading of substrate and catalyst, so we introduced additional portions of syngas (CO:H2 = 1:3) as it was consumed to bring conditions closer to the standard. After nine reactions, the catalyst’s weight decreased from 120 to 75 mg because of mechanical losses, but in the 9th cycle it was still active in both hydroformylation and hydrogenation (conv. 98 %, aldehyde select. 56 %, alcohol select. 20 %). Further, the catalyst after nine cycles will be referred to as KN*. ICP-AES results show that after nine reactions Rh content decreased from 1.93 to 1.13 % wt. The results of HR-TEM images (Fig. 7 ) of KN reveal the absence of rhodium clusters and nanoparticles, which suggests that Rh/amine complexes are the most probable state of rhodium in KN. This is also indicated by the fact that Rh and N are evenly distributed over the sample (Fig. 8 ). TEM images of KN* are very similar to those of KN, and no significant difference could be observed. Rhodium does not aggregate during the catalytic reactions; the elemental distribution (Rh, N, Si) remains the same. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns do not display rings formed by discrete diffraction spots, which may be indexed as diffraction planes of Rh nanoparticles. KN and KN* samples were investigated by XPS (Fig. 9 ). Two rhodium peaks are observed at binding energies 307.7 eV and 312.4 eV. According to the spectra, rhodium atoms are found in one oxidation state. Most probably, these bands belong to Rh+1 (literature data: 307.8 eV and 312.5 eV for Rh3d5/2 and Rh3d3/2, respectively [45]). Binding energies are also close to those reported in reference [46], where they were attributed to Rh+1/amine complexes. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum of KN* demonstrates slight changes in rhodium coordination sphere. The signals are shifted to higher binding energies compared to the initial KN spectrum. The binding energies (308.3 eV and 313.0) can still be attributed to Rh+1 bonded to amino groups of the support [47]. We observe that the yield of alcohols decreases much more readily than total oxygenate yield, which may indicate a change in the rhodium microenvironment. In fact, after four reaction cycles (Fig. 6) the performances of KN become closer to those of KR, where amino groups had not been methylated before rhodium was introduced, so rhodium is most likely attached to secondary and primary nitrogen atoms not effecting its hydrogenation activity as much as tertiary ones. Possibly, in KN either rhodium leaches from its complexes with tertiary nitrogen atoms and after several reactions is only bonded with secondary/primary nitrogen atoms remain unmodified, or the tertiary nitrogen atoms themselves undergo some transformations. Several versions of what can happen to N-containing rhodium hydroformylation catalyst during the reaction are presented in [25]. Most probably, rhodium is leached into the solution in the form of carbonyl complexes, which are removed with the liquid phase when the catalyst is separated from the reaction mixture. The liquid phase obtained by centrifugation after hexene-1 hydroformylation/hydrogenation on KN was found to be active in octene-1 isomerization and hydroformylation. After 3 h, under general conditions (T = 80 °C, p(CO:H2 = 1:3) = 6.0 MPa, octene-1 0.6 mL) octene-1 conversion in this case reaches 98 % with 73 % aldehyde selectivity and n:iso ratio of 1.4, which obviously indicates the presence of rhodium in the solution. Nevertheless, no aldehyde hydrogenation is observed. The use of Rh(acac)(CO)2 as a precursor in the homogeneous reaction (Table 4) also leads to aldehydes being the only oxygenates produced from octene-1. We also conducted the same experiment with KR to find out if methylation is responsible for Rh leaching. The results were close to those for KN: octene-1 conversion was 98 %, aldehyde selectivity 63 %, n:iso = 1.9, no alcohols were found. The difference in aldehyde yield led us to the conclusion that Rh content in the solution after reaction is slightly lower in case of unmethylated support, so, probably, methylation, though not causing the leaching, can affect it. It should be mentioned here that KN initially had contained a little more Rh than KR (Table 3). We can suggest the different nature of the two stages of the tandem reaction in the presence of KN. Both rhodium hydrocarbonyls leached to a liquid phase and rhodium atoms coordinated by amino groups on the material’s surface can contribute to hydroformylation of olefins [17]. The reversibility of the transfer between these two states cannot be excluded. However, hydrogenation of aldehydes turns out to be heterogeneous process, as it doesn’t take place in the absence of Rh-N bonding under the investigated conditions (Fig. 10 )."
12,Conclusions,"The materials obtained by the interaction between rhodium precursor Rh(acac)(CO)2 and surface tertiary amino groups of mesoporous hybrid organic-inorganic materials (BP-1 and WP-1 modified by NH2-groups methylation) could be considered as possible non-phosphorous catalysts for the tandem liquid-phase hydroformylation/hydrogenation reaction. For the selected catalyst KN high-resolution TEM microscopy and XPS analysis showed high dispersion of rhodium atoms in oxidation state +1 bonded with nitrogen both in the fresh and used catalyst. No huge Rh° clusters or nanoparticles are observed on the surface of the catalyst after 9 cycles (total run time 40 h) in octene-1 hydroformylation/hydrogenation. The catalyst remains active in hydroformylation with some activity losses in the intermediate aldehyde hydrogenation step, giving a stable total yield of oxygenates with a drop in alcohol selectivity. The reason for the drop is leaching, possibly accompanied by the changes of the microenvironment of Rh atoms, their rearrangement, and, as a result, less intensive interaction between Rh and NMe2-fragments compared to the fresh catalyst. We showed that the range of different unsaturated substrates such as hexene-1, styrene, cyclohexene could be converted into corresponding alcohols with sufficient yields. In the case of ethylene, only propanal can be achieved using this protocol. The influence of the main reaction parameters such as temperature, total pressure, composition of syngas, solvent type, and reaction time in octene-1 hydroformylation/hydrogenation is evaluated. In 12 h’ reaction at 80 °C in toluene at 6.0 MPa syngas (CO:H2 = 1:3) pressure octene-1 transforms into a mixture of n- and iso-nonanols (n/iso = 1.1) with 92 % yield. The catalytic system demonstrates high TOF (hydroformylation TOF = 312 h−1 at 21 % conv.) and selectivity compared to analogs described in literature."
