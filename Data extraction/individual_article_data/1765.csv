0,Introduction,"Sustainable hydrogen supply and water management are the two most significant sustainability issues facing biorefinery development. Production of transportation fuels from biomass via pyrolysis enables production of hydrocarbon fuels, making it a high priority alternative for biorefineries. However, due to the high oxygen content of biomass, significant amount of hydrogen is needed for deoxygenation and generation of fuel hydrocarbons. The ability to produce hydrogen from biomass or biomass-derived streams can significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions released by use of natural gas as a hydrogen source. Production of hydrogen from natural gas contributes 18% to capital costs via the thermochemical route converting biomass to fuels (Jones et al., 2013). Biomass used for pyrolysis typically contains 20% moisture or more resulting in a water-rich bio-oil from the pyrolysis process. Fast pyrolysis and intermediate pyrolysis generate a bio-oil product which is essentially a mixture of aqueous and organic phases. Separation of the bio-oil for fuel production produces large amounts of aqueous phase containing organic carbon from biomass. A bio-oil derived from switchgrass was reported to contain over 70% aqueous phase (Imam and Capareda, 2012). If the carbon from the aqueous phase is not recovered, a significant fraction of biomass and energy is lost to the water phase, decreasing the overall efficiency of the process. Production of renewable hydrogen from biomass is a long-sought technology for moving away from fossil fuels and towards a low-carbon economy. Microbial electrolysis is a versatile technology capable of addressing the issue of hydrogen production as well as water management (Logan et al., 2008). By extracting energy from the aqueous stream in the form of hydrogen and treating water, the efficiency of biomass to fuel production can be increased by minimizing external hydrogen requirement and enabling water recycling (Borole, 2011). Previous work on bioanode development has resulted in a highly enriched anode consortium using the waste stream from ethanol fermentation, capable of converting furan aldehydes, phenolics, and other normally inhibitory compounds (Borole et al., 2009d, 2013). Optimization of electroactive biofilms to handle complex wastewater streams requires a multipronged approach that includes process, system design and biology parameters (Borole et al., 2011b; Sleutels et al., 2012). Recent advancements in understanding of the electrochemical performance of anode biofilms and the dependence of the enrichment process on organic loading, continuous vs. batch substrate delivery and other parameters have led to current densities reaching above 20A/m2 (Ichihashi et al., 2014; Sleutels et al., 2012). In this study, we report conversion of the complex mixture of organics present in the bio-oil aqueous phase (boap) derived from biomass pyrolysis containing phenolic compounds, furan aldehydes, organic acids and sugar derivatives in an MEC to produce hydrogen. This mixture is overall more recalcitrant than the fermentation stream previously utilized in bioanode (Borole et al., 2013). The development of an electroactive microbial community capable of handling the toxic compounds and generating hydrogen using a switchgrass pyrolysis-derived aqueous phase is reported. The composition of the microbial community developed for treatment of boap is described. The efficiency of conversion in the anode as well as cathode, and overall hydrogen production efficiency and productivity and their reproducibility in replicate experiments in two different MECs is reported."
1,Methods,
2,Biomass pyrolysis,"2.1 Biomass pyrolysis The feedstock used in the study was air-dried switchgrass with particle sizes less than 2mm and a moisture content of 7–8wt%, which was obtained from Genera Energy Inc. (Vonore, TN). A semi pilot auger pyrolysis system was used in this study to carry out intermediate pyrolysis. The system was equipped with a feeding system, an auger pyrolysis reactor, a biochar collector, a particle-precipitating chamber, and a condensation section (Supplemental Fig. S1). A detailed description of the pyrolysis system used in this study, (located at the Center for Renewable Carbon, University of Tennessee), is provided elsewhere (Kim et al., 2011). In brief, the bio-oil used in this study was produced under the following operation conditions. The feedstock was transferred from the feeding hopper to the pyrolysis reactor by a single auger with feeding rate of approximately 8.5kg/h. The pyrolysis reactor (10W×10H×250Lcm) contains internal dual augers. The auger speed controlled the residence time of feedstock at 72s. The heated zone comprised of a 200cm long electrical resistance furnace operating at 500°C. The sweeping gas (nitrogen gas, 20L/min) was introduced into the front of the auger reactor and moved with the evolved vapors to the condensation section. Before the vapors enter the condensers from the auger reactor, the particle chamber (20cm in diameter and 100cm long) precipitated fine particles from the vapors. The biochar produced from the feedstock was collected into the biochar drum. The condensation section comprised of three condensers in series (10cm in diameter and 200cm long, each). Before the pyrolysis operation, all condensers were cooled to 10–15°C using a circulation water cooling system. The bio-oils collected from three condensers were immediately combined and mixed for homogeneity and stored in the walk-in freezer until used for characterization. The pyrolysis operation was performed in duplicate."
3,Bio-oil separation and characterization,"2.2 Bio-oil separation and characterization The crude bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis reactor was mixed with distilled water in a ratio of 1:4 (wt.%) to separate bio-oil aqueous phase (boap: water soluble fraction) and an organic phase (water insoluble fraction). The mixture was shaken vigorously and placed at 4°C overnight. Then the mixture was centrifuged in an IEC Clinical centrifuge (model 120) at 5000rpm for 30min to ensure the phase separation. The boap was collected and weighed to determine the amount of bio-oil dissolved in the water. The separated aqueous phase (boap) was used for hydrogen production in the MEC system. The chemical compounds in boap were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and quantified by GC-flame ionization detector and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A Shimadzu GC–MS (QP2010S) with a Restek Rtx-5MS capillary column was used. The column was programmed at 45°C for 3min, then at 5°C/min to 150°C without holding, then 10°C/min to 260°C and a hold time of 7min. The inlet was set at 240°C, and sample injection was made in split mode (1:20). The compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra with those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectral data library. Due to the very high water content in the boap, organic compounds were first extracted by ethyl lactate and chloroform and then analyzed by GC–MS. The crude bio-oil was diluted a factor 20 times before being injected into the GC–MS. GC–FID with a HP-5 column was used for quantifying volatile compounds in boap. The same program with the GC–MS was used in GC–FID. A HPLC system (Jasco 2000Plus, Jasco analytical instruments) equipped with PU-2089S Plus pump, a MD-2018 Plus Photodiode Array detector (PDA), a RI-2031 Plus intelligent RI detector, and an AS-2055 Plus auto sampler was used to analyze boap for non-volatile compounds. The liquid chromatography was conducted at 50°C using Bio-rad HPX-87H (300×8mm) column. The volume of injected sample was 20μl. The mobile phase was 5mM H2SO4 with or without 15% acetonitrile (v/v) with a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The method using 15% acetonitrile was used primarily to ascertain elution of all peaks from the column and to determine appropriate run time. The use of acetonitrile posed a problem with quantification of organic acids; therefore a method without acetonitrile was used with a longer run time of 120min."
4,MFC and MEC construction,"2.3 MFC and MEC construction The bioelectrochemical system used in this study consisted of a two-chamber cell that was convertible between MFC and MEC. The anode consisted of a carbon felt (projected surface area=12.56cm2, specific surface area=454cm2 cm−3, anode volume=15.96cm3) that was plasma treated to increase hydrophilicity (Borole et al., 2009b). The anode and cathode chambers are separated by a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) consisting of Nafion and- platinum-deposited carbon (0.5mg/cm2; 10% Pt; E-TEC, FuelCellsEtc., Bryan, TX) on the cathode side. The cathode chamber was 16ml and included a 12cm2 piece of stainless steel mesh as a current collector in contact with the Pt-deposited carbon cathode. The cathode inlet/outlet was open to air during operation of the system as MFC but was sealed and made oxygen-free by sparging with N2 for MEC operation. The two chambers were connected via an external resistor attached to a carbon rod current collector inserted into the anode and stainless steel wire at the cathode. All enrichment and experiments were carried out at room temperature (22°C)."
5,Inoculation and operation,"2.4 Inoculation and operation The MFC was inoculated using previously enriched consortia from two different anodes. The first was from an anode pre-enriched on boap, which used an inoculum from a bioanode grown on a corn stover-derived fermentation process stream (Borole et al., 2013). The second came from an anode fed with furan aldehydes and phenolic model compounds as the substrate (Borole et al., 2009d). Multiple consortia were used to enable broad specificity in the new community to handle the different class of compounds present in boap. The inoculum consisted of a total of two cores (5mm diameter×12.5mm length) cut out of the anode carbon felt along with anodic biofilm grown on the felt from the previously mentioned anodes. The inoculum was immediately transplanted into a similar-sized hole in new MFC anode felt. Two duplicate MFCs were developed in parallel and followed an enrichment procedure similar to that reported previously (Borole, 2010; Borole et al., 2009b). The operation of the MFC prior to testing included continuous supply of boap added directly in the flow line via syringe pump as shown in Fig. 1 . The starting load on the MFC was 220Ω, at which the MFCs reached their peak voltage of 0.36V after 14days. The resistance was then dropped to 100Ω on day 15 and to 51Ω on day 17. Glucose was supplemented in batches of 0.2g/l approximately once a month over the first 6months of operation to facilitate growth of boap converting microbes. A minimal nutrient medium consisting of mineral salts and vitamin solution was used as reported previously (Borole et al., 2009b). The medium was placed in an external reservoir and circulated through the anode chamber at a flow rate of 5mLmin−1. Media and planktonic cells were replaced intermittently to maintain an optical density (600nm) of the medium below 0.05 units."
6,Chronoamperometry – hydrogen production,"2.5 Chronoamperometry – hydrogen production The air–cathode was converted to an oxygen-free cathode by sparging with N2 to enable operation of the system as MEC. Additionally, the cathode chamber was filled with 12ml of 100mM phosphate buffer followed by additional sparging with N2. A viton tube was attached to the cathode outlet and was inserted into an inverted 100 or 250ml graduated cylinder containing DI water for gas collection. The cathode inlet was then sealed and the nitrogen sparging stopped to allow collection of hydrogen gas. Chronoamperometric measurements were conducted by poising the anode electrode at a potential of −0.2V relative to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Nam et al., 2011). The cell potential was also recorded to determine the total energy applied to the cell. The method to operate MEC by poising the anode electrode was used instead of poising the cathode or applying a fixed potential across the cell since it offers the advantage of maintaining the anode potential at an optimal value and preventing damage to the anode community from excessively positive potentials .The cathode gas outlet line included a T-junction to allow gas sampling via a sealed septa sampling port. Boap was tested in batch at concentrations of 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1g/L as well as in continuous addition mode at an organic loading of 2, 4, 10g/L-day. The concentration and loading refer to COD of the boap supplied to the anode. The boap was diluted to 50g/L and filtered using a 0.45μm nylon filter before use. During batch tests with boap, time zero samples were taken before poising of the anode or circulation of the aqueous medium. Between experiments, the anode medium was replaced and the inlet and outlet lines flushed with fresh medium. The cathode buffer was also replaced between experiments. The hydrogen production measurements were initiated immediately after starting chronoamperometry. A Reference 3000 potentiostat/galvanostat/zero resistance ammeter (Gamry Instruments, Warminster PA) was used for all MEC experiments. Depending on the substrate level used, each experiment was allowed to run between 8–24h. At the end of each run, the volume displaced by hydrogen production was measured, gas samples for GC analysis were taken from the cathode outlet to confirm hydrogen production, and samples for HPLC analysis were taken from the external anode reservoir to measure the extent of conversion of the substrates in boap. HPLC samples from MEC were centrifuged for 10min at 4500rpm, and then filtered with 0.2μm nylon filter and stored at 4°C for analysis. HPLC samples were analyzed as described in Section 2."
7,COD analysis,"2.6 COD analysis Samples prepared for HPLC as outlined above in Section 2.5 were also analyzed via the Hach COD method. A 2ml sample was added to a Hach COD digestion vial and inverted several times for mixing. The samples were then placed in a Hach DRB 200 reactor at 150°C for 2h. Upon completion, samples were allowed to cool to room temperature before spectroscopic analysis. A calibration curve was generated prior to running samples, utilizing 10 concentrations from 25mg to 1000mg of COD standard solution (Potassium Acid Phthalate). Absorbance readings were taken at 620nm on Spectronic 20 Genesys and converted to concentration based on the calibration curve."
8,DNA extraction and 16s rRNA analysis,"2.7 DNA extraction and 16s rRNA analysis MFC’s were disconnected and moved into an anaerobic glove bag for sampling of the microbial community from the anode felt. The MFC’s anode chamber was opened up and a coring tool was used to remove a 5mm diameter×12.5mm long core of felt from above the inlet area in the anode, which was replaced by a fresh piece of matching felt. Cores were stored in either sterile MilliQ water or 25% glycerol in freezer vials for storage at −80°C. Genomic DNA was isolated using the standard freeze–thaw procedure, followed by phenol–chloroform extraction (Borole et al., 2009a,b). Extracted and purified DNA samples were submitted to Hudson Alpha Genomic Services Lab (Huntsville, AL) for library prep and 16s rRNA analysis. Their methods included PCR reactions were run using 10ng of input template, V3–V4 amplicon primers, and Kapa Master mix (20 cycles). Products were purified using 0.75X beads, and were then put into a second, indexing PCR reaction (Kapa master mix, 12 cycles of PCR, GSL3.7 indexes for I7). Final libraries were purified and quantified by Qubit. Products were pooled using the Biomek liquid handler and profiled using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Kapa qPCR was also done for another quality control. Sequencing was then carried out with MiSeq 250bp PE run and sequence data was analyzed on BaseSpace using 16S Metagenomics v1.0.1 (ILLUMINA, INC)."
9,Calculation of Coulombic efficiency and other conversion efficiencies,"2.8 Calculation of Coulombic efficiency and other conversion efficiencies Performance was characterized by anodic Coulombic efficiency (CE), cathodic conversion efficiency, percent hydrogen yield, electrical efficiency and overall energy efficiency. CE was calculated from the produced current (I obs), the moles of substrate (n s) used and the number of electrons available per mol of substrate (based on complete conversion to CO2) (n e), using the following equation: CE anode = I obs t n s n e F F is Faraday constant and t is the duration of the experiment. The boap concentration was measured as COD as well as using HPLC analysis. However, all compounds were not identified by HPLC and therefore the total concentration of organics in boap was not available. Therefore, COD measurements before and after MEC treatment were used to determine the substrate concentration and loading. The total COD of the boap before dilution for MEC treatment was 130g/L. The compounds identified by HPLC are being reported separately (Ren et al., 2015, manuscript in preparation) and were used to understand the conversion of the individual compounds in the anode. Percent hydrogen yield was calculated as grams of hydrogen produced per gram of hydrogen expected from conversion of substrate utilized in the anode. Since absolute boap concentration was not available, COD was used as a measure of substrate concentration to calculate the percent yield: Y H2 = PV H2 / RT 2 Δ n COD where P is the atmospheric pressure, (V H2) is the volume of hydrogen produced, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and (ΔnCOD) is the moles of COD consumed during the experiment. Hydrogen productivity or rate of hydrogen production was calculated directly from the volume of hydrogen produced per unit anode volume per unit time: Q H2 = V H2 / V anode t Cathodic conversion efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the amount of hydrogen produced and the maximum amount of hydrogen that could be produced based on the average current generated over the experiment (I obs). This was calculated by the following equation: CE cat = V H2 I obs tRT 2 FP Energy efficiency calculations were done using the method described by Logan et al. (2008) defined by the overall ( η E + S ), which is calculated from the combustion energy of hydrogen (W H2), substrate input ( W s ), and electrical energy input ( W E ): η E + S = - W H2 W E - W s The energy content used for boap was based on COD and estimated to be 14.955kJ/gCOD (Lide, 1995). Similarly, electrical efficiency ( η E ) is the ratio of total energy recovered as hydrogen (W H2) to the electrical energy input (WE ). η E = - W H2 W E"
10,Results and discussion,
11,Bio-oil production and pyrolysis yields,"3.1 Bio-oil production and pyrolysis yields Pyrolysis of switchgrass using a pilot-scale auger reactor yielded 50–54% bio-oil, 29% biochar, and 17–21% non-condensable gas. Two separate pyrolysis runs were carried out, but only the bio-oil from the first run was used in the experiments described in this report. The compounds identified in the two bio-oils were similar as described in Section 3.2."
12,Bio-oil and aqueous phase characterization,"3.2 Bio-oil and aqueous phase characterization After separation of the aqueous phase from the bio-oil via addition of deionized water, about 35.1wt% organic compounds in the crude bio-oil were extracted to the aqueous phase (boap) to form a solution of about 8.3 wt% of organics in the aqueous phase. This corresponds to a COD of 130g/L. The aqueous fraction contained about 19.1wt% of the original biomass as dissolved organics. Fig. S2 shows a distribution of the pyrolysis products and the organic and aqueous fractions resulting from fractionation of bio-oil after water addition. Compounds identified by GC–MS in the crude bio-oil and aqueous phase are provided in Table S1 in Supplemental information. The identified compounds were mainly categorized to nine groups: acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, furans, ketones, phenolics, sugars, and PAHs (poly aromatic hydrocarbons). The compounds extracted into the aqueous phase based on GC–MS analysis indicated that the boap contained alcohols, furans, ketones, and phenolics. Organic acids and levoglucosan were detected in crude bio-oil at high concentration and were extracted into the aqueous phase. According to the GC–MS analysis for crude bio-oil and boap, a total of 17 compounds including 3 acids, 3 furans, 2 alcohols, 6 phenolics, 2 ketones and 1 anhydrosugar were quantified by GC–FID and HPLC-PDA. Among these compounds eight major compounds were quantified by HPLC-PDA and another 9 compounds were quantified by GC-FID using external standards. The results for quantification of the compounds in boap are shown in Table 1 . Levoglucosan and acetic acid were detected in boap at concentration of 15.33 and 11.96g/L. Other compounds were present at relatively lower concentrations, generally below 3g/L. The total amount of compounds quantified by HPLC in boap was about 37g/L. GC–FID analysis quantified 9 volatile compounds in boap. GC–FID analysis showed 1,3-propanediol, 2(5H)-furanone, and 1-hydroxybutanone at relatively higher concentrations (>1g/L) with additional 6 other compounds which were below 0.6g/L in boap. Total amount of compounds quantified in boap by GC–FID was about 6.02g/L. The total concentration of compounds quantified together by HPLC-PDA and GC–FID was 43.01g/L."
13,Microbial anode development,"3.3 Microbial anode development The duplicate MFCs developed using the methods described in Section 2.4 were operated for 8months prior to this study with boap as the substrate and reached a stable output of 1mA at a loading of 2g/L-day. The development of an anode microbial consortium capable of utilizing the complex compounds in boap that are also inhibitory to microbial growth was possible due to addition of glucose as a co-substrate. Previous trials without inclusion of glucose did not yield sufficient current production (data not shown). Acclimation and enrichment of a variety of microbes with different roles is critical to enhance the overall ability of the community to collectively breakdown a wide spectrum of compounds and harvest the electrons (Borole et al., 2011a,b, 2013)."
14,16s rRNA analysis,"3.4 16s rRNA analysis Fig. 2 shows characterization of the anode community based on taxonomical classification of 16S rRNA genes, identified to the family level. As expected, Proteobacterium dominated the community potentially due to its diverse metabolic capabilities and utilization of the molecules in the complex boap. The duplicate bioanode showed significant similarity in community structure among the major families identified, sharing 5 of the top 8 families, including Geobacteraceae, and Rhodocyclaceae. The relative proportions of the members did vary slightly, with the most significant difference between duplicates being the presence of Enterococcaceae (16%) and Comamonadaceae (10%) occurring at high proportions in the first and second duplicate, respectively. While these duplicate MFC’s were treated identically, natural variation in the starting inoculum, which was a biofilm growing on carbon felt electrode core removed from other bioanodes, could be a reason for the differences. In addition to the common Geobacteraceae family known for electrogenic activity, Rhodocyclaceae has also been previously found in acetate-fed bioanodes and have also been linked to versatile metabolic capabilities including fatty acid and aromatic conversion (Borole et al., 2009a; Hesselsoe et al., 2009). The family Comamonadaceae has been found in cellulose-fed bioanodes and can also convert short-chain fatty acids and has been shown to be capable of electricity generation (Rismani-Yazdi et al., 2007; Xing et al., 2010). The family Enterococcaceae also contains known electrogens such as Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella oxytoca (Sun et al., 2010). The presence of a variety of microbes with differing capabilities and unclassified bacteria is likely the result of the complex substrate used in this study, since multiple studies have indicated the effect of carbon source on community development and the establishment of syntrophic interactions (Borole et al., 2011b; Pant et al., 2010)."
15,Microbial electrolysis,"3.5 Microbial electrolysis 3.5.1 Batch operation Investigations into hydrogen production with batch addition of boap resulted in an average hydrogen production rate of 1.28±0.17LH2/L-anode-day (referred to as L/L-day henceforth) at a boap concentration of 0.1g/L. Increasing the boap concentration increased the hydrogen productivity to 1.91±0.47L/L-day. This rate was an average obtained over a period of 8–20h, depending on the boap concentration used. The current production during the MEC operation is shown in Fig. 3 . An average of four replicates is shown in Fig. S5 in the Supplemental information to demonstrate reproducibility. The initial current produced in the MEC during the first hour was in the range of 5–10mA, depending on the boap concentration, which dropped to less than 1mA over the duration of the experiment. This shows that the initial rate of hydrogen production was much higher than the average. At a concentration of 0.3g/L, the rate of hydrogen production in the first two hours was 9.3L/L-day, but the average over the duration of the experiment was less than a fifth of the initial rate. Hydrogen collection was halted after the current dropped below 1mA in all experiments. A replicate MEC (MEC B), operated under the same conditions resulted in a similar hydrogen production profile. The results are shown in Supplemental Fig. S3. The differences in the two replicates can be attributed to small differences in inoculum and unequal biocatalyst density during growth in the anode. The anode Coulombic efficiency (CE) for the MEC A ranged from 93±1.7% at boap concentration of 0.1g/L to 76±3.1% at a concentration of 0.3g/L. The results for the replicate (MEC B) as well as MEC A are shown in Fig. 4 A. The anode CE was calculated using COD of the samples before and after MEC treatment. The cathode conversion efficiency ranged from 77±3.4% to 81±2.4% for MEC A and 81±2.99% to 86±7.6% for the duplicate, MEC B (Fig. 4B). Thus, the boap concentration appears to have a negligible effect on the anode CE and cathode conversion efficiency. The percent hydrogen yield obtained at the three batch concentrations ranged between 56±8.2% and 72±1.8% (Fig. 4C). Thus, the percent hydrogen yield also appears to be negligibly affected by boap concentration under batch conditions. 3.5.2 Continuous substrate addition Effect of boap loading on MEC performance was assessed by changing the loading from 2g/L-day to 10g/L-day. The hydrogen production rate increased proportionally with the boap loading rate from 0.9±0.06 to 4.3±0.05L/L-day as shown in Fig. S4 in Supplemental information. The corresponding current density was 1.2±0.1A/m2 to 4.5±0.22A/m2, respectively. Compared to the batch run, the current production as well as hydrogen generation was relatively constant during the continuous addition experiment. The anode CE, cathode conversion efficiency and percent hydrogen yield are shown in Fig. 4D–F. The anode CE decreased from 96±0.2% at 2g/L-day to 54±6.5% at 10g/L-day. The cathode conversion efficiency, on the other hand increased from 79±0.7% at 2g/L-day to 94±5.5% at 10g/L-day. The hydrogen yield, on the other hand, decreased from 76±0.5% to 50±3.2%, respectively. 3.5.3 Conversion of individual components of boap In addition to determination of the total COD of boap, the samples were also analyzed by HPLC. This allowed determination of conversion of many of the individual compounds that could be resolved by the HPLC. Fig. 5 shows the percent conversion of acetic acid, propionic acid, levoglucosan, 2-furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as well as the total which represented the sum of all compounds that were quantified by HPLC. It is observed that under batch conditions, more than 98% removal of acetic acid and furfural was achieved. Conversion of propionic acid was between 67–100% and that of HMF was between 21–57%. The majority of the phenolic compounds were also removed. Based on all the peaks quantified by HPLC, a total reduction of 92–95% was observed, demonstrating significant conversion of the furan aldehyde and phenolic compounds present in boap as well. Under continuous boap addition experiments, similar results were obtained (Fig. 5B). This shows that the anode microbial community was very efficient in conversion of the organic acids, levoglucosan and furfural present in boap. A high level of conversion of the quantified phenolic compounds was also observed as evidenced by the reduction in the ‘Total’ percent reduction in Fig. 5, which includes phenol, 1,2-benzenediol, vanillic acid, guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol. 3.5.4 Energy efficiency The electrical energy efficiency (EE) and overall energy efficiency for the conversion of boap into hydrogen are shown in Fig. 6 . Under batch conditions, the overall EE decreased from 58±5.6% at a boap concentration of 0.1g/L to 51±3.3% at 0.3g/L. The efficiency results provided are average of the two replicate MECs. The electrical EE also decreased from 175±11% to 149±6%, respectively. Under continuous addition conditions, the efficiencies decreased with increasing loading rate as shown in Fig. 6B."
16,Improvement in treatment of complex feed streams in MEC,"3.6 Improvement in treatment of complex feed streams in MEC In this study, the primary goal was to demonstrate the capability of microbial electrolysis systems to produce hydrogen from carbon/energy rich waste streams such as those resulting from biomass conversion platforms. A bioanode capable of efficiently converting a real-world, complex mixture of organic compounds was developed and its ability to remove major compounds of interest within the mixture including corrosive and acidic compounds such as acetic acid and phenolic acids was demonstrated. The productivity of 4.3LH2/L-day achieved using the boap feedstock is the highest reported productivity for a complex substrate that we know of Table 2 contains H2 productivities and system information for MEC studies reported in the literature. Lu et al. were able to achieve a productivity of 1.41L/L-day using a post-fermentation effluent at an applied potential of 0.6V in a single-chamber membraneless MEC (Lu et al., 2009). Escapa et al. were able to achieve a similar productivity of 1.42L/L-day at mucher larger anode volume>200ml using a synthetic fermentation effluent by altering the HRT and increasing the applied voltage to 1V (Escapa et al., 2013). A common occurrence among other studies with lower output could be the lack of sufficient enrichment of the anode biocatalyst. It is our observation that in many other studies use of an anode with un-enriched inoculum or use of a model substrate for enrichment and testing with the substrate of interest is practiced. Our experience has shown this is insufficient for developing a robust community needed for treating complex waste streams, and use of enrichment procedures as that developed in our laboratory for mixtures of various substrates can alter community structure to enhance the functional capabilities of degradation and electron transfer (Borole et al., JPS 2008; ChemElectroChem 2014). Our focus on bioanode enrichment using a patented enrichment process with a previously enriched inoculum over several months resulted in development of a community capable of converting a variety of compounds into electrons. The dominant phyla of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in the bioanodes have well-established syntrophic interactions for conversion of a variety of carbon compounds, as well as the presence of known electrogenic families such as Geobacteraceae allow for the conversion of a variety of compounds with high CE (Freguia et al., 2010; Kiely et al., 2011). Furthermore, our two-chamber system has been previously optimized relative to many other studies employing different designs such as H-type reactors, minimizing anode dead space and reducing electrode spacing, etc. (Borole et al., 2009b). Additionally, where other studies commonly utilize an applied potential difference between anode and cathode, the use of a method setting anode potential at −0.2V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode used in our study may have contributed to maintaining a steady, high bioanode performance. This method also allows the cell voltage to reach the 1V range, but prevents the anode from reaching damaging positive potentials that can occur when setting a strict potential difference (Nam et al., 2011). The bioanode developed for this study also achieved high productivities of 12.4L/L-day under continuous addition of acetic acid as a substrate (data not shown), even though this community has been enriched for a multi-substrate complex mixture and not pure acetic acid. Further growth of anode biofilm and utilization of alternate cathodes can potentially improve the performance even higher."
17,Advancements in conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield,"3.7 Advancements in conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield While there was some variation in values for anode Coulombic efficiency among batch experiments due to experimental run time, maximum CE and percent hydrogen yield reached values of 93%±1.7% and 81%±2.35% respectively. The volume of hydrogen produced over the length of the experiments varied from 9–54mL depending on the type and rate of loading, reaching the highest value during 10g/L-day of continuous boap addition. A reduction in both H2 yield and CE was observed at the higher concentrations, but this reduction was much more pronounced for continuous addition experiments, where the average CE and H2 yield reduced to 54%±6.5% and 54%±3.4% at 10g/L-day, respectively. CE and H2 yield tend to trend together as H2 production is a direct function of the electrons and protons harvested from the anode, but H2 yield values can be slightly lower due to system losses and proton diffusion. Conversely, COD removal increased in opposite fashion, reaching the highest percentage of 52% at 10g/L-day boap. The increased COD removal and decreased CE and H2 yield could be explained by higher activity of fermentative organisms in the anode due to increased substrate saturation at higher loading rates, contributing to COD removal without harvesting electrons and protons decreasing CE and H2 yield. Maximum COD removal for batch studies was 48%±1.5% at 0.2g/L boap. COD removal values were somewhat lower than those reported in the literature for other complex/wastewater streams. This is likely due to the complexity of compounds present in boap, many of which are recalcitrant and commonly inhibitory to many microbes. Additionally, the experiments were stopped when the current production reached below 1mA, and not continued until the current production ceased, indicating potential for higher COD removal with longer run times. Nonetheless, overall energy efficiency and electrical efficiency values were in the range of those reported for MEC studies, reaching values of 62%±0.67% and 167%±2.26% in batch studies. One of the problems with bioanodes operated at high substrate concentration or loading rate is production of methane (Escapa et al., 2013; Ishii et al., 2008). Absence of methane in the product gas and absence of archaea in the bioanode demonstrate the effective suppression of methanogenic population from bioanode developed in this study. Experiments conducted in continuous and batch mode of substrate addition further illustrate that even when high substrate loading was used, methane production did not occur. The efficiency of conversion of boap to hydrogen was similar in both modes of operation, further illustrating the advantages of the enrichment and MEC operational procedure employed (Borole et al., 2009b, 2011a)."
18,Implications for biorefinery application,"3.8 Implications for biorefinery application With continuing improvement in the ability to utilize significant portions of compounds present in many biorefinery waste streams at high efficiencies, microbial electrolysis systems have real potential for commercial integration into multiple biomass conversion platforms (Borole et al., 2009d, 2013). While commercial-scale pyrolysis technology is still being developed, making it difficult to predict the volume and composition of an aqueous-phase stream, a recent update at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) estimates that a 2000ton/day pyrolysis plant would require 1000m3 water/day, and produce approximately 1000m3 wastewater/day (Jones et al., 2013). This high water demand coupled with high GHG emitting natural gas reforming for H2 production makes microbial electrolysis an attractive alternative for continued development. The PNNL study also alludes to this, stating that alternative, sustainable forms of hydrogen will be necessary for advancing the technology if they can be developed and made economically viable. Besides the pyrolysis platform, biomass to ethanol bioconversion and algal hydrothermal liquefaction are additional platforms that could be integrated with microbial electrolysis systems. A 2000 ton/day lignocellulosic biorefinery has the theoretical potential to generate 7200m3/h of hydrogen, based on the assumption of 50% conversion efficiency and a biodegradability factor of 0.5 (Borole and Mielenz, 2011). In order to continue the rapid improvement of bioelectrochemical systems to meet future commercial demands, expanded efforts in under-investigated areas of metagenomics and transcriptomics of anode communities along with development of sustainable cathode materials or biocathodes, will be required in addition to continued efforts in improving reactor design and performance."
19,Conclusion,"An integrated pyrolysis–microbial electrolysis process for hydrogen production was demonstrated. The MEC demonstrated a productivity of 4.3LH2/L-day and a percent hydrogen yield of 50.4±3.2% at a loading of 10g COD/L-anode-day. A maximum anode Coulombic efficiency of 96±0.21% and a maximum cathode conversion efficiency of 94±5.5% were also achieved, albeit at different loading rates. Nearly complete conversion of acetic acid, propionic acid, levoglucosan and furfural was observed with an overall energy efficiency of 48–63%. The hydrogen produced from the integrated process can be used to hydrodeoxygenate bio-oil to make fuel, while reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions."
