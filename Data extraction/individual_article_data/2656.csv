0,Introduction,"Nanoarchitectonics is a term recently coined at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) in Japan, making reference to materials prepared by the assembly of structural nanobuilding blocks using different experimental approaches [1]. Subsequently, nanoarchitectures make reference to certain nanostructured materials generally prepared by bottom-up approaches within the nanoarchitectonics concept [2,3]. Many of these types of materials are related to nanoarchitectures based on silica and silicates, including different types of clays used as building blocks [4–6]. Nowadays, the energy demand requires the development of improving technologies allowing its production and storage in a sustainable way. It is generally assumed that the use of energy in the future must take into account hydrogen based technologies as this element could be regarded as an ideal vector for clean energy [7]. Therefore the research on advanced materials for the technologies related to hydrogen production [8–12], as well as on hydrogen uptake, storage and delivery is becoming a hot topic [13–15]. Furthermore, the use of green materials in the preparation of the related products and devices should take into account the use of eco-friendly components such as silicates belonging to the clay minerals family [16–18]. Bottom-up approaches have been applied to modify layered and fibrous clays giving rise to functional nanomaterials useful for diverse applications [4,5,19–22]. Among the above mentioned materials, nanoarchitectures based on clays represent an innovative way to prepare under mild conditions porous heterostructures using organoclays and alkoxides as precursors [4,5]. In the case of clays showing lamellar structure, such as montmorillonite (Fig. 1 B), this approach gives rise to nanoparticles (NPs) that remain associated to the delaminated clay layers resulting in heterostructured materials of high pore volume and elevated specific surface area [4,5]. In this way, in the last years it has been reported diverse exfoliated-clay nanoarchitectures assembled to different type of NPs, such as silica, titania and silica/alumina NPs [4,5,23]. A similar strategy for the synthesis of clay-based nanoarchitectures has been successfully applied to the non-swelling fibrous clays, such as sepiolite (Fig. 1A) and palygorskite [5,24–27]. The previous organic modification of this type of clays by assembling them with cationic surfactants, gives rise to a controlled formation of NPs covering in this case, the external surface of the silicate fibers [5]. One advantage of these synthetic strategies based on sol–gel methods is the possibility to introduce during the synthesis additional diverse elements that can act as doping compounds in the formed NPs [24]. The use of commercially available organoclays, that present advantages in terms of industrial scale-up, has been also successfully reported for the synthesis of diverse nanoarchitectures [5]. Following the above mentioned sol–gel route, anatase-clay nanoarchitectures have been here prepared by generation of TiO2 NPs on the interface of the Closite 30B® and Pangel B® commercial organoclays, which respectively derived from montmorillonite and sepiolite modified using cationic surfactants. Noble metals (NMs) such as Pd and Pt NPs were further assembled to generate a new type of nanoarchitectures in order to adequate the required characteristics of the material for specific applications in photocatalysis [28–30].Pd and Pt NPs were chosen as it is well known that they are suitable metals for hydrogen production [30–34], showing a great efficiency even when they are present at very low content [35]. To reach this goal, decoration of the TiO2 (anatase)/clay nanoarchitectures with Pd or Pt NPs has been here done following two synthetic approaches introduced as a scheme in Fig. 2 : i) in situ generation of the noble metal NPs during the sol–gel process (SG route); and ii) photodeposition of the metal NPs in the previously formed anatase/clay nanoarchitectures (PD route)."
1,Experimental,"The commercial organoclays used in this work were Cloisite® 30B supplied by Southern Clay Products (Rockwood Company, Texas, USA) and a sepiolite of the Pangel B type [36] supplied by (TOLSA, S.A.). Cloisite®30B is a montmorillonite of natural origin (Wyoming, USA) modified with a cationic surfactant. This organic modifier is a quaternary ammonium salt corresponding to MT2EtOH (methyl, tallow, bis-2-hydroxyethyl, quaternary ammonium), where tallow (T) presents the following statistical composition (65% C18, 30% C16, 5% C14), being chloride the respective anion acting as counter-ion. The total organic content in this organoclay is ca. 30% in weight. Pangel®20B (TOLSA S.A.) is a commercial fibrous clay (originated in the Madrid region, Spain), also modified with a quaternary ammonium salt. The organic modifier in this case corresponds to methylbenzyl-bis-(hydrogenated tallow alkyl), where hydrogenated tallow (HT) presents the following static composition (65% C18, 30% C16, 5% C14)."
2,"Synthesis of H–TiO2-MNT, H–Pt–TiO2-MNT and H–Pd–TiO2-MNT by sol gel method","2.1 Synthesis of H–TiO2-MNT, H–Pt–TiO2-MNT and H–Pd–TiO2-MNT by sol gel method The nanoarchitectures based on montmorillonite (MNT) were synthesized starting from a homogeneous suspension of 2 g of Cloisite®30B in 2-butanol (Sigma–Aldrich) at 10% (w/w) stirred during 24 h and submitted to several sonication cycles of 15 min each in a sonicator bath to promote homogeneous dispersions of the organoclay in the solvent. The suspension was heated at 50 °C and kept warm using a silicon bath for the whole process and then 3.75 g of titanium (IV) alkoxide (titanium tetraisopropoxide, TiPOTi, from Sigma–Aldrich), alone or incorporating either 0.076 g of palladium acetylacetonate (99%, Sigma–Aldrich) or 0.070 g of platinum acetylactenate (97%, Sigma–Aldrich), were diluted in 2-butanol 50% (w/w) and added drop by drop to the organoclay suspension. After 15 min, the stoichiometric amount of water required for the alkoxide hydrolysis was added to the mixture, which was stirred at 50 °C until its spontaneous gelation occurs (typically less than 24 h). The resulting solids (O–TiO2-MNT, O–Pd–TiO2-MNT, O–Pt–TiO2-MNT) were air dried at 40 °C overnight. The dried samples were heated in a tubular quartz oven at 500 °C (8 °C/min heating rate, the first 2 h under nitrogen flux and then in air for 4 h more), giving rise to the H–TiO2-MNT, H–Pd–TiO2-MNT (SG) and H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (SG)."
3,"Synthesis of H–TiO2-SEP, H–Pt–TiO2-SEP and H–Pd–TiO2-SEP by sol–gel method","2.2 Synthesis of H–TiO2-SEP, H–Pt–TiO2-SEP and H–Pd–TiO2-SEP by sol–gel method The nanoarchitectures based on sepiolite (SEP) were synthesized starting from a homogeneous suspension of 2 g of Pangel 20B in isopropanol (Sigma–Aldrich) at 10% (w/w) obtained by shear stirring with Ultraturrax® (model T25 digital) during 10 min. Then, 7.5 g of TiPOTi, alone or incorporating either 0.076 g of palladium (II) acetylacetonate (99%, Sigma–Aldrich) or 0.070 g of platinum (II) acetylacetonate (97%, Sigma–Aldrich), were diluted in iso-propanol 50% (w/w) and added drop by drop to the organoclay suspension. After 15 min the stoichiometric amount of water required for the alkoxide hydrolysis was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until a spontaneous gelation took place (in the present case typically less than 3 h). The resulting solids were dried in air at 40 °C (O–TiO2-SEP, O–Pd–TiO2-SEP and O–Pt–TiO2-SEP). The dried samples were heated as above indicated for the materials based on montmorillonite, reaching the formation of the H–TiO2-SEP, H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (SG) and H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (SG) final nanoarchitectures."
4,Synthesis of Pt and Pd doped TiO2-MNT and TiO2-SEP by photodeposition method,"2.3 Synthesis of Pt and Pd doped TiO2-MNT and TiO2-SEP by photodeposition method Different noble metal (NM) doping was performed over the as-prepared H–TiO2-MNT or H–TiO2-SEP supports by photodeposition method. Thus, for platinum deposition we used hexachloroplatinic (IV) acid (H2PtCl6, Merck 40% Pt) while for Pd we used PdCl2 (Alfa Aesar). Solutions of the appropriate concentrations of metal precursor (corresponding to a 1.0 wt% metal loading) in distilled water were prepared and mixed with the TiO2-clay (5 g TiO2 L−1), adding isopropanol as sacrificial donor (0.3 M final concentration). Photodeposition was performed by illuminating the suspensions for 2 h with an Osram Ultra-Vitalux lamp (300 W) while maintaining continuous nitrogen purging. This lamp shows a sun-like radiation spectrum and a main emission line in the UVA range at 365 nm. After photodeposition, the powders were recovered by filtration and dried at 110 °C overnight."
5,Materials characterization,"2.4 Materials characterization Characterization by FE-SEM was performed with a FEI microscope NOVA NanoSEM 230 model equipped with an EDAX-Ametek detector that allowed semi-quantitative analysis of the elements. Samples were placed on a carbon conductive tape, being directly observed without metalizing the surface of the sample. The morphology of samples was also followed by means of TEM microscopy (Philips CM 200 microscope). The samples were dispersed in ethanol using an ultrasound bath and dropped on a copper grid. Raman spectra were obtained using a 532 nm laser (μSense-LabC1X Enwave Optronics Raman Confocal equipment). FTIR spectra of pure samples were recorded between 4000 and 250 cm−1 with a Bruker IFS 260 66v/S infrared Fourier Transform spectrometer. The recovered solids were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), recorded in a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Lynxeye detector using Cu Kα radiation of 5–40° 2θ. 29Si solid-state CP/MAS-NMR spectra were acquired in a Bruker AV-400-WB spectrometer equipped with a 4 mm MAS NMR probe, with the samples spinning at a rate of approximately 10 kHz. For 29Si, the operating frequency was 20 kHz, using 5 ms excitation pulses (p/2), recycle delays of 5 s and 2048 scans. 29Si resonances were evaluated in relation to kaolin (−91.5 ppm) and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as secondary and primary references, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyser. Before the adsorption measurements, the samples were outgassed at 120 °C until the pressure remains constant and less than 5 Hg microns. The BET specific surface area was calculated from the nitrogen adsorption data in the relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.3. The external surface area and micropore volume was obtained by means of the t-plot according to De Boer's method."
6,Photocatalytic activity,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic H2 production tests were performed in a flow-reactor system by suspending the powder photocatalysts in an aqueous solution (300 mL, MeOH/H2O 10% v/v). The reaction media was kept in the 20°–25 °C temperature range to prevent any significant evaporation of the sacrificial agent. The catalyst suspension was firstly outgassed under a N2 stream (150 mL/min) for 30 min. After that the N2 flow was settled at 15 mL/min and stabilized for 15 min. This nitrogen flow was used to displace the hydrogen produced from the photoreactor headspace towards the GC measuring system. Then, the Hg medium pressure lamp (125 W, Photochemical Reactors LTD) was switched on and the effluent gases were analyzed to quantify H2 production by gas chromatography (Agilent 490 micro GC) using a thermal conductivity detector connected to a Molsieve 5 A and Pora-PLOT Q columns)."
7,Results and discussion,"TiO2-clay based nanoarchitectures incorporating Pd or Pt nanoparticles of interest as photocatalysts were prepared following the scheme in Fig. 2, which illustrates the synthetic pathway from the starting organoclays to the final nanostructured materials. In the sol–gel way (SG), the nanoarchitectures were generated by introducing the Pd or Pt NPs precursor, in the form of the corresponding metal-acetylacetonate, together with the anatase precursor, i.e. the titanium alkoxide (TiPOTi) in the alcohol medium in which the corresponding organoclay was previously dispersed. This route intends to assure the formation of the Pd or Pt NPs well dispersed within the TiO2-clay nanoarchitectures. The second approach, i.e. the photodeposition way (PD), implies a two steps method, in which TiO2-clay nanoarchiterctures were firstly prepared following the SG pathway but without incorporation of Pd or Pt NM precursors in the reaction media. In a second step, Pt or Pd NPs were incorporated via a photochemical post-treatment of the TiO2-clay nanoarchitectures in a similar way than reported by Hidalgo and co-workers for the preparation of systems containing Au, Pd, or Pt NPs on anatase NPs [30,37]. In this last case, it was observed that the metal NPs deposition was selectively produced onto the semiconductor NPs of anatase (vide infra) which could be very convenient to assure in our case the assembling of the metal NPs onto the anatase NPs already attached to the clay substrate."
8,TiO2/montmorillonite nanoarchitectures,"3.1 TiO2/montmorillonite nanoarchitectures TiO2 NPs formed in the controlled hydrolysis of the TiPOTi precursor and further submitted to calcination, are clearly visualized in the HR-TEM images being present as well defined crystals (see for instance the (101) planes in Fig. 3 C). These NPs have been characterized as anatase phase in agreement with XRD patterns and Raman spectroscopy of H–TiO2-MNT, H–Pd–TiO2-MNT (SG), H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (SG), H–Pd–TiO2-MNT (PD), H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (PD) samples, which is preserved after the photodeposition process in the samples prepared by this experimental way (Fig. S1 y S2, in supplementary information). FE-SEM images of the H–Pd–TiO2-MNT (PD) and H–Pd–TiO2-MNT (SG) nanoarchitectures (Fig. S3) show the typical habit of the starting layered clay, which in turn resembles to that of the starting organoclay (Cloisite®30B). EDX analyses of those samples indicate ca. 40% (w/w) of TiO2 content, in agreement with the incorporation of almost all the Ti precursor added to the mixture (1:1 clay/TiO2). The Pd and Pt content can be estimated in 2% and 1.5% w/w in the samples prepared by the SG way and by the photodeposition way, respectively. The presence of the noble metal NPs is clearly revealed by TEM (Fig. 3). As it can be observed, these images show a good NM NPs dispersion when they are generated by the photodeposition method (Fig. 3 A, B). It is also worthy to note that as previously anticipated, this PD method also provide a selective deposition of the NMs over the TiO2 particles (Fig. 3B). NPs generated by the SG method appear in a bigger size with a wider size distribution (Fig. 3C) when compared both Pt–TiO2/montmorillonite nanoarchitectures. TEM also shows (Fig. 3A) a general disaggregation of the clay NPs in interaction with TiO2 NPs, which is reliable with the clay delamination according to XRD patterns (Fig. S1), which has been also observed in other clay-based nanoarchitectures [23] As shown in some samples, a small fraction of the pristine clay remains stacked with variable interlayer distances (Fig. 3A). For instance, the H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (PD) nanoarchitecture shows an average distance of ca. 1.5 nm (measured in Fig. 3D), which can be corroborated in the XRD patterns. The incomplete delamination of organoclays from Wyoming montmorillonite by reaction with alkoxides has been already reported [5]. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C (Fig. 4 ) of the diverse nanoarchitectures derived from the montmorillonite lamellar clay present type IV isotherms according to the De Boer classification [38], showing a hysteresis loop that can be classified as H4, which is characteristic of solids with slit shape pores [39]. The shape of the adsorption and desorption branches points out to a tight path in the pores that generate typical ink bottle pores. In addition, at low relative pressure values, the isotherm can be ascribed to type I, which is attributed to the high affinity of the adsorbent (N2) towards the adsorbate. Interestingly, specific surface areas, calculated from the corresponding isotherms (Table 1 ) show significant increase compared to the calcined pristine Cloisite®30B (11 m2/g) and even with related materials like pillared montmorillonite doped with a similar Pt content (59 m2/g) [21]. These high values agree with the delamination of the phyllosilicate increasing therefore the adsorption amount of nitrogen molecules to the resulting nanoarchitectures [5,23]. The micropore volume remains almost constant in the nanoarchitectures as well as in the H–TiO2-MNT intermediate in comparison to the calcined Cloisite®30B (0.070 cm3/g). Thus, the main difference between the thermally treated Cloisite®30B sample and the resulting nanoarchitectures in terms of BET specific surface area must be related to the strong increase in the external surface area values."
9,TiO2/sepiolite nanoarchitectures,"3.2 TiO2/sepiolite nanoarchitectures FE-SEM images of the nanoarchitectures synthesized using Pangel B as starting organoclay show the typical fibrous morphology of sepiolite (Fig. S4). EDX analyses of all the prepared nanoarchitectures have a TiO2 content of around 60% in weight, which is in good agreement with the initial 2:1 proportion in the titanium alkoxide:clay starting mixture. The Pd or Pt metal content can be also estimated as 2% w/w in the samples prepared following the SG way and 1.5% for the PD way, respectively. The XRD peak at ca. 1.2 nm assigned to the (001) reflection plan in sepiolite remains with minor changes in the diffractograms of the resulting nanoarchitectures after the calcination process, confirming the preservation of the sepiolite structure despite the folding effect provoked by the thermal treatment [40]. The presence of TiO2 NPs (anatase phase) in the H–TiO2-SEP, H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (SG), H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (SG) samples is confirmed by XRD (Fig. S5). On the other hand, the characteristic Eg vibration mode of anatase is clearly detected by Raman spectroscopy [41] (Fig. S7). The presence of TiO2 in the anatase phase is preserved in the H–TiO2-SEP nanoarchitectures after the photodeposition process, in the same way that observed in the nanoarchitectures based on layered clays (vide supra). It can be assumed that anatase NPs are attached onto the surface of the clay through Si–O–Ti bonds as occurs in other sepiolite-titania samples reported elsewhere [24]. The effective bonding participation of the silanol groups of the sepiolite surface with the NPs present in the nanoarchitectures is deduced from the strong decrease in intensity of the 3720 cm−1 IR band ascribed to the O–H stretching vibration mode of the silanol groups of sepiolite [42] (Fig. S7). This is also confirmed by the changes in the intensity of the Q2 and Q3 signals observed in the 29Si NMR spectra of the sepiolite based nanoarchitectures compared to the pristine silicate [24] (Fig. S8). Similarly to the previous systems, TEM images of the nanoarchitectures generated by the PD method (Fig. 5 A) showed a preferential distribution of the Pt NPs on anatase showing also here a good distribution on the sepiolite fibres surface. When the Pt NPs are generated by the SG method, larger aggregates of the metal NPs were detected that can be located along the sepiolite structure (Fig. 5B). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C of the H–TiO2-SEP, H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (SG), H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (SG), H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (PD), H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (PD) nanoarchitectures based on the sepiolite fibrous clay also present a type IV isotherm [38] with a hysteresis loop classified as H339 (Fig. 6 ). This behaviour can be related to the presence of pores with different pore size in the range of meso- and macro-pores. This highly disordered porosity can be ascribed to the presence of fiber bundles that promotes void spaces inside and between the fibre aggregates. The absence of the inner microporosity characteristic of starting sepiolite (Table 1) confirms a homogeneous coverage of the clay surface by the formed NPs, which are limiting or impeding the access of N2 molecules to the structural tunnels during the adsorption measurements, as observed in the assembling of this silicate with diverse species [42]. The calculated external surface area for the SG sepiolite-based nanoarchitectures (Table 1), including the intermediate H–TiO2-SEP samples, is slightly higher than that of the folded sepiolite resulting from similar thermal treatments [40]. This increase can be tentatively explained by the sepiolite modification due to the NPs anchorage onto the silicate fibres. Concerning the H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (PD) and H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (PD) nanoarchitectures prepared by photodeposition, their textural characteristics depend on the nature of the involved noble metal. Thus, in the H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (PD) nanoarchitecture is observed an increase in the BET value from 141 m2/g to 172 m2/g accompanied by a development of microporosity (0.0041 cm3/g). This microporosity can be ascribed to small paths between closed packed of Pd NPs onto the surface on the intermediate H–TiO2-SEP material. On the other hand, the specific surface area of the H–Pt–TiO2-SEP nanoarchitecture also increases with respect to that of the H–TiO2-SEP intermediate. In this last case, it can be supposed that the Pt NPs, are mainly associated with the TiO2 NPs without interparticle aggregations."
10,Catalytic properties,"3.3 Catalytic properties The synthesized nanoarchitectures are tested as potential photocatalyst in the production of hydrogen by photoreforming of methanol [34] observing that all the tested samples show photocatalytic activity. As it can be observed, montmorillonite-based nanoarchitectures clearly show lower values as hydrogen production catalyst than sepiolite-based nanoarchitectures (Fig. 7 ). Comparing the synthesis method within anatase/montmorillonite nanoarchitectures, the hydrogen production in the SG way nanoarchitectures is higher (5 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (SG), 4 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (SG)) than the production obtained using PD way nanoarchitectures as catalysts (3.5 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (PD), 2 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pt–TiO2-MNT (PD)). The small differences between the productions obtained for each anatase/montmorillonite catalyst could be related to the fact that the quantity of Pd and Pt metal NPs is higher in the SG way than in PD way. As above mentioned, sepiolite-based nanoarchitectures clearly provide higher hydrogen production rates with respect to montmorillonite ones. In the case Pt-sepiolite-based nanoarchitectures, against montmorillonite-based nanoarchitectures, PD route is notably more efficient on hydrogen production than the SG way, despite the quantity of metal NPs in weigh and the BET value are lower for PD nanoarchitectures. The dispersion of the NPs and the selectivity in the junction between the Pt and anatase NPs seems to be determinant in the efficiency of the nanoarchitectures for the catalytic process. Hydrogen production of the sepiolite-based nanoarchitectures for Pd NPs (5 mmol h−1g−1 for H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (PD), 10 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pd–TiO2-SEP (SG)) are much less efficient than Pt NPs (34 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (PD), 25 mmol h−1g−1 H–Pt–TiO2-SEP (PD)). The change on the trend of the efficiency of the catalyst for Pd in the PD way front Pd in the SG way points to a less effective deposition onto the previous synthesize semiconductor NPs for Pd NPs than for Pt NPs. In fact, in a previous study it has been stated that it is difficult to achieve a high photodeposition yield for Pd in comparison to Pt or Au [43]. It must be also remarked that the reaction rate remains constant during the reaction in all the performed attempts, for SG and PD way, Pd doped and Pt doped nanoarchitectures, pointing out to the high stability of these materials."
11,Conclusions,"The experimental approach here applied to prepare the new TiO2-clay nanoarchitectures allows the incorporation of noble metal NPs (Pd, Pt) giving rise to materials with different texture and showing diverse efficiency as photocatalysts in the hydrogen production. The synthetic strategy drives to the formation of TiO2 NPs that remain immobilized onto the clay surface and act as active centres for the further association of Pd or Pt NPs. The arrangement and organization of both types of NPs (the semiconductor anatase and the NMs) in the nanoarchitectures is a key factor regarding their photocatalytic properties. In this sense, the best hydrogen production is obtained for the nanoarchitectures based on sepiolite where Pt NPs are incorporated following the photodeposition method. Interestingly, these materials exhibit high stability as photocatalysts remaining constant the rate of hydrogen production during the studied reaction time. However, further work is necessary to completely evaluate their performance as catalysts for practical uses by studying complementary aspects such as the effect of metal loading, the use of different sacrificial agents (ethanol, isopropanol, glycerol, etc) or the catalyst reusability. Production rate registered for these materials has special interest and open a new path of development in the field of clean energy production."
