0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of society and the massive increase of population, a huge demand has been created for renewable and environmentally-friendly energy. As a potential green energy source, H2 holds a prominent position in the future renewable energy system to replace traditional fossil fuels [1-6]. Conventional hydrogen production is achieved through methane reforming and coal gasification, a process which is non-renewable and produces a large amount of greenhouse gas. By contrast, electrocatalytic water splitting is a more environmentally-friendly and renewable technology for hydrogen production [7-10]. Typically, the water splitting process can be divided into two half reactions: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [11]. HER is a reduction half-reaction of water splitting (2H+ + 2e → H2), which requires an efficient catalyst capable of reducing the overpotential [12, 13]. Although Pt-based materials have exhibited the best performance for HER so far, the high price and scarcity limit the large-scale application in industry. Therefore, it is urgent to develop highly effective alternatives with high abundance and low price to replace Pt as HER catalyst. In recent years, group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been widely studied due to their abundant reserve and unique physico-chemical properties [14–17]. As a typical TMD, MoS2 has been considered as a potential substitute for Pt-based HER catalysts due to its low price, abundant active sites and good stability [18-22]. In nature, MoS2 usually exists as a thermodynamically stable 2H phase. However, the inert basal plane and poor electrical conductivity limit its further improvement of HER performance. Therefore, researchers adopted phase engineering to transform semiconductor 2H-MoS2 into metallic 1T-MoS2 to improve the electrical conductivity [23-25], or employed defect engineering [26-28] to produce additional active sites on the basal planes for better HER performance. However, most of the current reports have adopted only one of these approaches. There are a large amount of review literatures that summarizes phase engineering and defect engineering, and the reader should refer to these literatures to avoid duplication [1,20,21,29]. In comparison, the defect-rich 1T-MoS2, which combines the two advantages at the same time, shows more excellent HER performance and will be more attractive. However, only a few studies have reported this kind of promising material for HER application. Therefore, on the basis of previous studies and summaries, this paper focuses on the latest progress of the application of 1T-MoS2 with rich defects in HER. Firstly, we briefly introduce the different crystal structures of MoS2 and the confirmation of 1T-MoS2, the type and characterization of defects in MoS2. Then, we introduce in detail the synthesis methods of defect-rich 1T-MoS2 and its catalytic performance in HER. Finally, we summarize and look forward to the challenges and future research directions emerging from the MoS2 materials. We hope that this review can provide references and suggestions for future research on MoS2-based HER catalysts."
1,Structure of MoS2 and advanced characterization,
2,Polymorphs of MoS2,"2.1 Polymorphs of MoS2 As a typical lamellar material, bulk MoS2 is vertically stacked by hexagonal sheets. The monolayer structure of MoS2 is S-Mo-S in which Mo atoms are connected to six S atoms through covalent bonds. However, weak van der Waals interaction exists between adjacent layers in a manner similar to graphite. Generally, MoS2 has three different crystal phases including 1T-, 2H-, and 3R- (Fig. 1 a), where the numbers indicate the number of S-Mo-S layers in a unit cell and the letters represent the tetragonal, hexagonal and rhombohedral symmetry, respectively [30]. 2H-MoS2 is thermodynamically stable and dominant in nature, and thermodynamically unstable 3R-MoS2 will be easily transformed to 2H-MoS2 upon heating. Besides, the metastable 1T-MoS2 does not exist in nature and small intercalated molecules are usually required to convert 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2. Therefore, 1T-MoS2 needs to be stabilized or it will be converted to 2H-MoS2 when heated above 95 °C [31]. Considering the atomic arrangement and electronic structure, the Mo atom is surrounded by six S atoms in a trigonal prism coordination for 2H-MoS2, resulting in the splitting of Mo 4d orbitals and the formation of separated dZ 2, xy, x 2 - y 2 and d yz, xz bands. Thus, the two Mo d electrons are filled in the dZ 2 orbital with opposite spin, leading to semi-conductivity and high stability of 2H-MoS2. While for 1T-MoS2, the MoS6 unit displays an octahedron coordination and gives it to degenerated d xy , xz , yz and dZ 2 , x 2 - y 2 orbitals [32]. Consequently, the incomplete filling of d xy , xz , yz orbitals leads to metallic characteristic and instability of 1T-MoS2 (Fig. 1b). During intercalation, charge transfer occurs between the guest molecules and MoS2 layers. The donated charge from guest molecules will occupy the lower-lying orbitals and destabilize the 2H phase, thus allowing the conversion of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 [33]. According to previous report, the electronic conductivity of 1T-MoS2 is 105 times higher than that of 2H-MoS2 [34], making it an excellent electrode materials in the fields of energy conversion and storage [35-38]. In addition, the active sites of 2H-MoS2 towards HER are located on the edge planes, and the basal planes are catalytically inert. However, 1T-MoS2 also has abundant active sites for HER on the basal planes based on both the experimental and theoretical results [39, 40]. Therefore, 1T-MoS2 shows much better HER activity than 2H-MoS2 due to the superior conductivity and the rich active sites on both basal and edge planes."
3,Confirmation the presence of 1T-MoS2,"2.2 Confirmation the presence of 1T-MoS2 Due to the significant difference in structure, metallic 1T-MoS2 can be well distinguished from semiconductor 2H-MoS2 by characterizations of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). However, it should be emphasized that the confirmation of metallic 1T-MoS2 usually requires several combination results of the above characterization methods. The crystallinity, number of layers and layer spacing of MoS2 materials can be well illustrated by XRD patterns. In general, 1T-MoS2 can be obtained by exfoliation or ions/molecules intercalation, while the XRD patterns obtained by the two methods are usually different. The 1T-MoS2 obtained by exfoliation is generally in single layer or few layers, and the weak crystallinity makes it difficult to confirm the presence of 1T-MoS2 (Fig. 2 a) [41]. Hence, it is necessary to combine other characterization results such as Raman, XPS and HRTEM as supplement. For the ions/molecules intercalated 1T-MoS2 samples, the layer spacing will inevitably become larger due to the presence of intercalated species, resulting in the downshift of diffraction peak at 2θ = 14o. For example, Liu et al. observed that the NH4 +-intercalated 1T-MoS2 showed two new peaks at 2θ = 9.31o and 18.65° corresponding to layer spacing of 0.95 nm and 0.48 nm, while the peak at 2θ = 14o assigned to 2H-MoS2 disappeared (Fig. 2b) [42]. Besides, Wang et al. reported that the phase transformation of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 by Na+ intercalation cause the (002) peak shift from 14.38o to 12.42o [43]. Apart from NH4 + and alkali ions, some other ions/molecules such as H2O [44, 45], CH3OH [46], CH3CH2OH [47] or reduced graphene oxide [48] could also be inserted into the interlayer. Consequently, the size of intercalated ions/molecules have a great influence on the corresponding spacing of (002) planes. Raman spectroscopy is the simplest and most effective characterization method to directly confirm the presence of metallic 1T-MoS2 phase [23]. However, it is important to note that the laser energy for the test should be less than 0.1 mW in order to prevent in-situ phase transition [39]. Typically, 2H-MoS2 usually exhibits two characteristic peaks at 383 and 408 cm−1 attributed to the in-plane mode (E1 2g) and out-of-plane mode (A1g) [49]. With the appearance of 1T phase, the peak intensity of E1 2g and A1g are greatly weakened, and a new group of vibration peaks belonging to J1, J2, Eg 1 and J3 modes appear in the 150, 219, 280 and 327 cm−1 (Fig. 2c) [23]. The Eg 1 peak indicates that Mo is octahedrally coordinated in MoS6 unit of 1T-MoS2. Besides, the existence of 1T phase usually requires the appearance of J1, J2, Eg 1 and J3 because both 2H-MoS2 and 1T-MoS2 have A1g peak. Therefore, the observation of characteristic peaks of 1T-MoS2 with the disappearance of E1g band of 2H-MoS2 suggests the high purity of 1T phase. XPS is also an important approach to directly differentiate the crystal phase of 1T- and 2H-MoS2 due to a 0.9 eV difference of binding energy caused by distinct coordination structure. Hence, a doublet located at binding energies of 232.4 and 229.2 eV are assigned to Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 of 2H-MoS2 [50-52], while a downward shift of these two peaks to 231.5 and 228.3 eV are the characteristic peaks of 1T-MoS2 (Fig. 2d) [53]. Correspondingly, the S 2p peak has the same downward shift trend. More importantly, XPS is the only characterization technique which can quantitatively analyze the content of 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 phases. By deconvoluting the peak in the Mo 3d region, the content ratio of 1T/2H phase could be easily obtained. For example, Sun et al. adopted an ammonia-assisted hydrothermal method to realize phase engineering of the as-prepared MoS2 materials. With the increase of urea amount, the content of 1T phase was increased from 16.4% to 90.2%[54]. Acerce et al. synthesized MoS2 nanosheets with 1T phase content of about 70% utilizing an electrochemical exfoliation method [55]. The detailed atomic arrangement of 1T-MoS2 could be directly visualized by HRTEM observations. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the magnified image clearly showed a trigonal lattice of octahedral coordination for 1T-MoS2, while a honeycomb lattice of trigonal prismatic coordination was observed for 2H-MoS2 [56]. As concerning for the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns, 2H phase usually displays six independent diffraction spots, and 1T phase shows another six extra spots at 30° between the six spots of 2H phase. For the 2H-1T mixed phase, six independent diffraction arcs is typically observed [54]. The UV-vis spectrum can also be used to distinguish 1T-MoS2 from 2H-MoS2 due to the different colors of their solutions. As reported by Geng et al. [34], 1T-MoS2 dispersed in water shows grey color while 2H-MoS2 water solution displays a green color, where the distinct optical properties could be revealed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. No obvious absorption peak was observed for 1T-MoS2 (M-MoS2) due to its metallic properties. However, 2H-MoS2 (S-MoS2) showed two absorption peaks at 613 and 660 nm which corresponded to the energy split from the valence band spin-orbital coupling (Fig. 3b)."
4,Type of defects,"2.3 Type of defects Based on the dimension, the defects in MoS2-based catalysts can be divided into the following three categories: vacancy, doping and complex defects [57]. Among them, vacancy and doping belong to 0-dimensional (0D) defects, which are the most common defect types in MoS2 materials. Complex defects mainly include 1D defects (dislocation), 2D defects (grain boundary and twin boundary) and 3D defects (spatial lattice disorder). The structure of these defects is complicated, which results in great difficulty in studying the defect role-HER performance relationship. Hence, in this report, we will be mainly focused on the discussion of vacancy and doping for defect engineering. Vacancy defects can be further classified into anion vacancy (S vacancy) and cation vacancy (Mo vacancy). According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the single sulfur vacancy has the lowest formation energy, thus making it the most common 0D defects observed in experimental results [58]. Through engineering sulfur vacancies, the electronic structure of MoS2 and H2 adsorption energy could be regulated to realize a better HER performance (Fig. 4 a). Generally, hexagonal monolayer MoS2 prepared by CVD method contains a certain amount of sulfur vacancies, and generation of these S vacancies will significantly enhance the intrinsic HER activity [59]. The sulfur vacancy can also be introduced by a lot of post-treatment methods such as H2 annealing (Fig. 4b) [60-62], plasma treatment (H2 [63], Ar [64] and O2 [65] plasma), irradiation treatment (ion beam [66-68], laser [69] and UV-ozone [70]), wet chemical etching (HNO3 [71], NaClO [72], NH4F [73] and H2O2 [74] etching) and electrochemical desulfurization method [75]. Doping refers to the entry of heteroatoms into the lattice of MoS2, which can be divided into metal doping and non-metal doping according to the different doping elements. The doping of non-metallic elements generally involves the introduction of O, N and P, which contributes to faster electron transfer by regulating the surface electronic states and improving the intrinsic conductivity. For example, Liu et al. reported P dopants could be the new active sites in the basal plane of MoS2 and help improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity (Fig. 4c), leading to a significantly improved activity for hydrogen evolution (Tafel slope 34 mV/dec and overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA/cm2) [76]. The oxygen-incorporated MoS2 prepared by hydrothermal method [80] and O2 plasma post-treatment [65] were reported to exhibit dramatically enhanced HER activity due to the improved intrinsic conductivity. Besides, the O and P dual-doped MoS2 was realized by a one-step hydrothermal method utilizing NaH2PO2⋅4H2O as precursor [81]. In addition to O and P doping, N doping has also been shown to be an effective mean of accelerating HER kinetics. Several strategies have been reported to successfully introduce nitrogen into MoS2 such as hydrothermal method using C2H4N4 as N precursor [82], one-step sintering method [83], self-templating strategy [84] and plasma-induced exfoliation [85]. Different from non-meal doping, metal doping was proved to regulate the electron distribution of adjacent atoms as well as affect the hydrogen adsorption energy. In recent years, a lot of noble and non-noble metals including Pd [86], Pt [78], Co [87], Ni [88], Fe [89], Cu [90], Zn [77] and V [91] have been doped into MoS2, resulting in improved HER performance. For instance, Shi et al. reported that Zn-doped MoS2 catalyst had a turnover of 15.44 s−1 at 300 mV overpotential (Fig. 4d), which by far exceeded the reported HER activity of MoS2-based catalyst [77]. The extraordinary activity of Zn-MoS2 was attributed to the synergistic effect of electronic effect (energy level matching) and morphological effect (rich active sites). As a newly rising hot research field, single-atom catalysis has attracted wide attention. According to the DFT calculation based on the exchange current density and H2 adsorption energy, the HER performance of different single-atom (SA) metal doped catalysts was screen out [78]. A volcano curve was obtained and the PtSA-Pt showed the best HER performance (Fig. 4e), which was also confirmed by the experimental HER activity trend of PtSA-MoS2 > CoSA-MoS2 > NiSA-MoS2. In addition to the simple defects mentioned above, other high-dimension complex defects also play an important role in improving the HER performance of MoS2 catalyst. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized 3D ultrathin MoS2 nanomesh/RGO (reduced graphene oxide) with high defect generation and large porosity which was demonstrated to improving HER performance due to rich defects (Fig. 4f) [79]. The generation of complex defects is usually accompanied by the production of point defects, and it is difficult to control the single type of complex defects such as grain boundary, dislocation or bulk phase defects. The synthesis methods to prepare complex defects mainly includes plasma radiation, ion irradiation and NaClO wet chemical etching."
5,Advanced characterization for defect structure of MoS2,"2.4 Advanced characterization for defect structure of MoS2 The defects of MoS2 can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by some advanced characterization techniques. These characterization methods mainly include microscopy characterization (SEM, HRTEM, HAADF-STEM), crystallology characterization (XRD) and spectroscopy characterization (Raman, EPR, PL and PAS). The defect information provides a better understanding for us to study the structure-performance relationship of MoS2-based HER catalysts and to optimize the catalyst design. Microscopic characterization can directly observe the existence of defects, and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) with high resolution can even obtain defect information at the atomic scale. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a commonly used microscopy technique to confirm the larger defects of MoS2. For instance, Ye et al. reported that large cracks and triangle holes were observed on CVD grown MoS2 with oxygen plasma treatment and hydrogen annealing treatment by SEM (Fig. 5 a and Fig. 5b) [61]. Zhang et al. found that the bulk MoS2 were broken into small pieces by NaBH4-assisted liquid exfoliation on SEM images [92]. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is a powerful tool to observe cracks, dislocations and distortions on the basal planes of MoS2. As shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. 5d, many dislocations and distortions were observed on the defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets. Besides, discontinuity could be also found on the (002) fringes, which suggests the basal planes were cut into nanosized domains by cracks [26, 93]. Due to the ultra-high resolution of HAADF-STEM, multiple defects and even point defects can be observed. For example, Wang et al. observed single S-vacancies and few agglomerate S vacancies on the surface of H2O2-ethched MoS2 (Fig. 5e) [74]. Anjum et al. found a large amount of point defects, steps and variable holes on the basal planes of all-in-one MoS2 [94]. In general, the presence of defects or doping might lead to changes in MoS2 cell parameters. Therefore, the information of changes in cell parameters caused by the introduction of defects can be characterized by XRD. As an example, the broadening of the (100) and (110) diffraction peaks highlighted that the defect-rich structure of MoS2 nanosheets [26]. Liu et al. found the peak at 14.1o of (002) crystal planes shifted to 9.8° for P-doped MoS2 due to the enlarged interlayer spacing (Fig. 5f) [76]. Although electron microscopy can obtain defect information on atomic scale, it suffers a main disadvantage that it can only provide local or regional information. Therefore, it will be of great significance for spectroscopy characterization which is non-destructive and can obtain the overall defect information. Through spectroscopy techniques, a lot of important information such as the crystal structure, electronic structure, defect density and lattice vibration could be obtained. Raman spectroscopy is a commonly used method to characterize the defects and electron band structure of MoS2. As shown in Fig. 5g, both the A1g and E1 2g peaks of arc-melted MoS2 showed an obvious red shift which represents the lattice distortion [95]. The similar phenomenon was also reported by Li et al. on the defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets [96]. Sun et al. attributed the red shift of E1 2g and blue shift of A1g peak for MoS2 quantum dots to the increase of edge sulfur vacancies [97]. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR or ESR) is widely utilized to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the defect information of MoS2 materials. Generally, the bulk MoS2 has no EPR signal, and the Mo-S dangling bonds signal will appear at g = 1.91-2.009 after sulfur vacancies were generated by ion beam etching or chemical etching. Meanwhile, the signal intensity increases with the extension of radiation or etching time (Fig. 5h) [74]. Besides, the specific number of sulfur vacancy could be calculated by combining the EPR data of standard sample and detected sample [98]. Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) can also be used as an effective auxiliary means to analyze defect information of MoS2. In general, the increase of defects consequently weakens the fluorescence signal intensity. Besides, a red shift was observed when oxygen defects were introduced, which was attributed to the radiative recombination of electrons at shallow defect states and holes in the valence band (Fig. 5i) [70]. Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) can obtain the type and content of defects by detecting the lifetime of positrons. Normally, the positron lifetime spectra could be fitted to an exponential function of three components corresponding to different annihilation sites. Yin et al. reported two components at 170 ± 5 ps and 321.8 ± 7 ps which were assigned to bulk lifetime of MoS2 and positron annihilation of S-vacancies [99]. Besides, the relative intensity of these two components reflects the relative concentration of S-vacancies (Fig. 5j)."
6,Fabrication methods for defect-rich 1T-MoS2,"So far, some synthetic approaches have been reported for the synthesis of defect-rich 1T-MoS2 materials. These methods can be divided into three main categories: (1) top-down approach such as exfoliation, gas treatment or plasma treatment, (2) bottom-up approach such as hydrothermal or solvent-thermal, (3) elemental doping, (4) novel strategies."
7,Exfoliation method,"3.1 Exfoliation method Chemical intercalation and exfoliation of bulk phase MoS2 is widely used methods to prepare metallic 1T-MoS2. Organic lithium compounds such as n-butyl lithium are the most commonly utilized exfoliation reagents [23]. This method should be carried out in an inert atmosphere (usually in an argon-filled glove box). The first step is the formation of Li x MoS2 species in the lithiation process. Then, ultra-sonication in the water for a period of time is applied to make Li x MoS2 react with water. The force generated by this reaction can facilitate the exfoliation process, thus resulting in monolayer MoS2 and transformation of 2H to 1T phase. In order to form a defect-rich structure, we have to make the reaction occur more intense to produce a much larger driving force. Recently, a liquid-ammonia-assisted lithiation (LAAL) strategy has been developed to promote the exfoliation of layered MoS2 material [99]. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the lithiation process was carried out under a MoS2/Li molar ratio of 1:5 and the lithiation reaction started when the liquid ammonia contacted with lithium (blue color). After ultra-sonicated in water for 30 min, a large number of bubbles was observed which suggests a severe reaction. Consequently, porous 1T-MoS2 (P-1T MoS2) with a large amount of holes, edges and S-vacancies was synthesized. According to the characterization results of XPS, Raman, EPR and PAS, the as-prepared P-1T MoS2 had a 1T phase percentage of 81% and a defects degree of 83.7%. Besides, a good stability was also observed for P-1T MoS2 because the current loss was negligible even after 1000 cycles. Although this method is an effective way to prepare MoS2 with high 1T phase content and defect-rich structure, it is highly dangerous and very complicated to operate. Guo et al. reported a NaBH4 hydrothermal exfoliation method to realize the phase and defect engineering of MoS2 [92]. The H atoms produced by NaBH4 were intercalated into the layer which promotes the exfoliation process. With the hydrothermal treatment temperature elevated from 140 °C to 180 °C, the 1T-phase percentage determined by XPS was increased from 7.0% to 53%, and the sulfur vacancy concentration was improved from 1.5% to 10%. This method is simple and feasible, but the content of 1T phase and defect concentration of the obtained MoS2 are much lower compared with the LAAL strategy."
8,Gas treatment and plasma treatment,"3.2 Gas treatment and plasma treatment Sulfur vacancies triggered by gas treatment and plasma treatment could act as electron donors in the MoS2 layers and drive the 2H-to-1T phase transformation. As depicted in Fig. 6b, Yang et al. used Ar and O2 to treat the pristine MoS2 at high temperature for a certain period of time, respectively [100]. The XPS and XANES results showed that both treatments could peel off sulfur atoms and induce the generation of 1T-MoS2, and the content of 1T phase was higher in O2 atmosphere. Therefore, O2 treatment had a stronger influence on the vacancy driven phase change and electronic modifications of MoS2, thus resulting in the formation of defect 2H/1T-MoS2. Ar plasma bombardment was another approach to induce local phase transition in monolayer MoS2 by creating single S vacancies on the top layer [101]. However, it should be noted that the energy of Ar ion beam should not be too high, otherwise the entire MoS2 layer will be etched. In addition, the 1T phase content of 1T/2H-MoS2 hybrid materials synthesized by this method was about 40%, and all of them are concentrated in the scale range of a few nanometers. Therefore, although gas treatment and plasma treatment are convenient methods to synthesize the defect-rich 1T-MoS2, the obtained MoS2 materials are usually in 1T/2H mixed phase and the proportion of 1T phase is not very high."
9,Hydrothermal and solvothermal method,"3.3 Hydrothermal and solvothermal method Hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis are typical bottom-up approaches to prepare defect-rich 1T-MoS2 and hybrids of defect-rich 1T-MoS2 to other carbon materials such as graphene and carbon nanotube. Compared with the exfoliation method and gas treatment method, hydrothermal method has the advantages of simple operation, large quantities of preparation, and high defect concentration and pure 1T phase of products. In the reported literatures, MoO3, NaMoO4•2H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24•6H2O are commonly used Mo sources, while CS(NH2)2 and CH3CSNH2 (TAA) are widely adopted as sulfur sources. Xie and co-researchers reported that defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets were successfully fabricated by utilizing (NH4)6Mo7O24•6H2O and CS(NH2)2 as precursors and employing excess CS(NH2)2 in the hydrothermal process [26]. In this case, thiourea is not only used as a reducing agent but also can be adsorbed on the formed nanocrystallites, thus resulting in a quasi-periodic structure and a large number of defects on the basal planes. Furthermore, Liu et al. found that NH3 molecules generated from the hydrolysis of excessive thiourea could be inserted into the MoS2 layers and caused electron transfer between interfaces, thus inducing the phase transformation from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 [42]. The intercalated NH3 molecules can also be produced by adding additional ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) [56] or urea (CO(NH2)2) [54]. However, it must be emphasized that the hydrothermal temperature cannot exceed 200 °C although excess NH3 molecules are produced, otherwise 2H-MoS2 will finally be obtained because the formation of 1T-MoS2 is more favorable at low temperatures [80]. Therefore, the key to synthesize defect-rich 1T-MoS2 by hydrothermal method lies in the use of excessive sulfur sources, the generation of a large number of NH3 intercalated molecules and the use of appropriate hydrothermal temperature. For example, Zhang et al. reported the preparation of defect-rich O-incorporated 1T-MoS2 nanosheets under hydrothermal conditions of S/Mo molar ratio of 4.25 and 200 °C (Fig. 6c) [102]. Besides, defect-rich 1T-MoS2/carbon nanotubes [104] and defect-rich 1T-MoS2/3D reduced graphene oxide hybrid materials [105] could be easily fabricated by adding carbon materials such as graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes to the feedstock at the same time through one-pot hydrothermal method. Also, some other inorganic materials such as CdS could react with the as-prepared defect-rich 1T-MoS2 through electrostatic interaction to form composite materials [102]. Solvothermal method with N, N-dimethylfumarate (DMF) and ethanol as solvents is also an effective way to prepare defect-rich 1T-MoS2. Recently, researchers found DMF was an excellent solvent because it could not only provide NH4 + but also has a better solubility than water during the solvothermal process. For instance, Zhang et al. reported that the 1T phase ratio of defect 1T/2H-MoS2 could be adjusted by changing the DMF/H2O ratio, and a highest 1T content of 70.14% was obtained when the DMF content was 50%[25]. Solvothermal treatment in ethanol could also create sulfur vacancies and induce 1T-MoS2 on MoS2 nanosheets. A two-step synthetic strategy was developed by Cai et al., i.e. the first step was hydrothermal synthesis with (NH4)6Mo7O24•6H2O/CS(NH2)2 ratio of 1:30 to obtain pure 2H phase, and a second critical solvothermal treatment in ethanol was conducted to introduce sulfur vacancies on 2H-MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets which promotes the transformation of the surrounding 2H-MoS2 local lattice into a trigonal (1T-MoS2) phase (Fig. 6d) [103]. Furthermore, Li et al. adopted a second ethanol solvothermal treatment to improve the stability of NH4 +-intercalated defect-rich 1T-MoS2 [47]. They found a strong interaction between ethanol and MoS2 surface which could decrease the total energy and strengthen the stability of 1T phase from 15 days to 360 days."
10,Elemental doping,"3.4 Elemental doping The elemental doping can affect the local electronic structure of MoS2 and form new interstitial states, thus inducing the phase transition and the generation of S vacancies. The commonly used doping elements are generally metals with single metal or bimetal doping, and in the form of atomic scale. The metal incorporating methods can be post-treatment doping or one-step doping approach. Recently, Zhang et al. reported a simple one-step post-impregnation method to prepare single-atom Ru doped MoS2 catalyst (SA-Ru-MoS2) [106]. HAADF-STEM images clearly showed that single Ru atoms precisely occupied the Mo atoms sites and bonded with S atoms in the lattice, favoring the 2H-to-1T transition and the formation of defects and lattice distortions (Fig. 7 a). The same phenomenon was also observed on atomic Pd doped MoS2 nanosheets, which simultaneously introduced sulfur vacancy and converted the 2H phase into the stable 1T phase [86]. In addition to precious metals, non-precious metals can also be doped on the basal planes with single atom state. For example, Qi et al. adopted an assembly/leaching strategy to prepare atomic cobalt array covalently bound to distorted 1T-MoS2 nanosheets [107]. The first step was modification of MoS2 nanosheets by Co nanodisks through sonication, and the second step was electrochemical CV leaching which resulted in the disappearance of Co-Co bond and in situ formation of single-atom Co array anchored onto the MoS2 surface. Ji et al. reported the one-pot solvothermal synthesis of single-atom Cu doped 1T-MoS2 nanosheets with a large number of S vacancies and variable pores (Fig. 7b) [90]. Ding et al. reported the successful co-doping of Fe and Mn into freestanding coral-like 1T-MoS2 by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, which had a concentration of 1T phase about 90.6% and a number of lattice defects [108]. Although metal doping is the most common used way, there are still very few reports that non-metallic doping can also cause S vacancies and induce phase transition. Recently, a P, W-doped MoS2 catalyst was synthesized by hydrothermal method using Na3O40PW12•xH2O as P and W source [109]. Due to the large atomic radius of P and W, lattice expansion and atomic rearrangement will be caused when incorporated into the MoS2 lattice, thus promoting the formation of 1T phase. At the same time, the distortion of lattice also produced a certain number of defect sites."
11,Novel strategies,"3.5 Novel strategies In addition to these traditional synthesis methods summarized above, some novel strategies have been reported in recent years for the preparation of defect-rich 1T-MoS2. For instance, Zhang et al. reported a facile microwave irradiation method to prepare the defect-rich 1T-MoS2 nanosheets, where the first step was a microwave-assisted route to obtain high purity 1T-MoS2 and the second step was sunlight-induced redox reactions to create a large number of defects [110]. The key step of this method was the reduction and oxidation reaction initiated by light radiation in the second step, which reduced the S/Mo molar ratio from 1.72 to 1.41, indicating that the loss of S is far greater than the loss of Mo during the generation of numerous defects (Fig. 7c). Anjum et al. developed a NH3-intercalated and reduction two-step method to prepare an all-in-one MoS2 catalyst [94]. The first step was hydrothermal treatment using phosphomolybdic acid, melamine and thiourea as raw materials, which generated intercalated NH3 molecules in situ to form ammoniated MoS2 (A-MoS2). Then, the subsequent reduction of A-MoS2 resulted in the removal of intercalated NH3 and H2S to form an all-in-one MoS2 nanosheets with a considerable concentration of 1T phase, exposed Mo edges, defects and S-vacancies (Fig. 7d). Gao et al. prepared a 3D follower-like defected 1T/2H MoS2 by magnetron sputtering, in which the 1T phase and S vacancies were caused by the Ar ions bombardment during the deposition [111]. A facile synthesis of 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers with rich defects was realized by anion exchange using MoO3 nanosheets as the exchange template [112]. In this process, the O2− of MoO3 nanosheets were exchanged with S2− anion to form MoS3, then MoS3 was soon reduced to MoS2 with phase change and defect formation."
12,HER performance of defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts,"The electrocatalytic performance comparison of different defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction was classified into three categories: (1) bare defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts, (2) element doped defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts and (3) defect-rich 1T-MoS2/carbon material composites. Several key parameters such as overpotential (η), Tafel slope, exchange current density (j0), electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), turnover frequency (TOF) and stability have been utilized to evaluate the HER performance [20]. Generally, the overpotential at a certain current density can be obtained through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve, and a lower overpotential indicates a better performance. The overpotential at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 is usually adopted as reference (η10). The Tafel slope and exchange current density are obtained from Tafel curve, which reflects the information of electron transfer rate and HER kinetics. An excellent HER catalyst should have a small Tafel slope and a large exchange current density. ECSA is calculated from cyclic voltammetry data which represents the actual exposed active surface area of HER catalyst. In addition, TOF refers to the number of transformed molecules converted by each active center, which is a reference to measure the intrinsic activity of different catalysts. Stability is also an important factor to measure the performance of an HER catalyst, which can generally be judged by the long term chronoamperometric test (V-t or I-t curve) or the change of LSV curve after several thousand cycles. It should be emphasized that HER performance is related to the pH value and concentration of the electrolyte solution, so the catalyst performance comparison in this paper was all carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4. In acidic medium, there are two main different mechanisms for HER process. No matter which pathway is going through, the first step is the generation of an adsorbed hydrogen atom (Hads) at the surface of catalyst (H+ aq + e− → Hads, Volmer step). Then, the next step could be two adsorbed hydrogen atom bonded to form a hydrogen molecule (2Hads → H2, Tafel step), or one adsorbed hydrogen atom bonded to another electron and proton to form H2 (Hads + H+ aq + e− → H2, Heyrovsky step). The Tafel slopes of Volmer step, Tafel step, and Heyrovsky step as rate-determining steps are 116, 29, and 38 mV decade−1, respectively. Therefore, we can infer whether the reaction pathway is Volmer-Tafel or Volmer-Heyrovsky by obtaining the Tafel slope."
13,Bare defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts,"4.1 Bare defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts For bare MoS2 catalysts, the phase change from 2H to 1T can significantly improve the electrical conductivity and activate the original inert basal surfaces. Also, the formation of defect-rich structure creates numerous additional active sites, and all these factors above contribute to improved HER performance. For example, Liu et al. reported a 1T/2H-MoS2 mixed nanosheets in which the induced 1T phase not only enhanced the electronic conductivity but also produced more active sites [53]. Besides, some defects were formed at the 1T and 2H phase interfaces due to lattice mismatch. Thus, a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA/cm2, Tafel slope of 61 mV dec−1 and good stability were resulted. Yang et al. developed a spatial confinement strategy using layered double hydroxides as support to prepare ultra-thin 1T-MoS2 flakes [113]. Due to the dual advantages of highly active 1T phase and rich defects, this catalyst had a η10 of 254 mV and a small Tafel slope of only 64 mV dec−1. The Tafel slope suggested a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, and Heyrovsky process is the key step. A prickly pear-like three-dimensional porous MoS2 (ZT-MoS2) was reported by Lu et al. utilizing hydrothermal synthesis and ZnO as hard template [114]. Due to excess thiourea was added, the ZT-MoS2 had a high concentration of 1T-MoS2 phase and rich defects. Meanwhile, the prickly pear-like structure of ZT-MoS2 enabled it expose a large number of edge sites. Consequently, a low η10 overpotential of 110 mV, a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 and a long-term stability of 5000 cycles were obtained, which shed light on the design of 3D defect 1T-MoS2 catalysts for efficient HER process. One of the most interesting work in the field of MoS2-based HER catalysts was conducted by Yin et al., which studied the influence of phase, edges and sulfur vacancies on the HER activity [99]. The authors prepared a porous metallic MoS2 (P-1T MoS2) and another four MoS2 catalysts including 1T-MoS2, 2H-MoS2, porous 2H-MoS2 (P-2H MoS2) and sulfur-compensated porous 2H-MoS2 (P-2H MoS2 + S) as comparison. The results showed that the 1T-MoS2 was more active than all the 2H-MoS2 catalysts, which suggests phase is the most important factor affecting the HER performance. The better performance of P-1T MoS2 than 1T-MoS2 indicated that both edge and S-vacancies contributed to enhanced HER activity. Finally, by comparing the performance of P-2H MoS2 and P-2H MoS2 + S, it is concluded that increased S-vacancies contents helped to improve the HER performance. Therefore, through combining all of the above advantages, the P-1T MoS2 showed a prominent HER activity which had a low η10 of 153 mV and a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8 a-8c). This work provides guidance on how to design efficient MoS2-based HER catalysts from the perspective of basic research."
14,Element doped defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts,"4.2 Element doped defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts The elemental doping can effectively modulate the electronic state and intrinsic conductivity of MoS2, thus significantly improving its HER performance. Luo et al. activated the inert basal planes of MoS2 by atomic Pd doping, which induced sulfur vacancies and 1T phase formation [86]. The optimized catalyst had a very small η10 of 78 mV, a large exchange current density of 805 μA cm−2 and excellent stability. Density functional theory calculations showed that Pd replaced the Mo and strongly activated the neighboring sulfur sites which had a low hydrogen adsorption free energy of -0.02 eV (ΔGH). Similarly, a single-atom Ru doped MoS2 exhibited a superior HER performance in alkaline medium with η10 of 76 mV and Tafel slope of 21 mV dec−1 [106]. The high HER activity was attributed to the electronic structure regulation by S vacancies formation and phase transition, which significantly reduced the energy barriers of the Volmer step and adsorption/desorption of H*. The enhanced HER activity was also reported on a non-noble metal single-atom Cu doped porous 1T-MoS2, which displayed a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1 and a low η10 overpotential of 131 mV [90]. The enhanced HER activity was caused by the synergistic effect of atomic Cu doping, metallicity and a large number of defects. Theoretical calculation results showed that Cu doping could not only stabilize the 1T phase, but also enhance the electron transfer ability. More importantly, an extraordinary high HER activity was obtained on a single-atom cobalt array covalently bound to distorted 1T MoS2 nanosheets (SA Co-D 1T MoS2) [107]. The η10 was extremely low of only 42 mV, and a lowest Tafel slope of 32 mV dec−1 was obtained compared with the reported non-Pt-based materials. Besides, SA Co-D 1T MoS2 showed negligible current density loss after 10000 cycles, indicating the long-term durability. The characterization and theoretical calculation results showed that atomic Co is the main active center, and the ensemble effect between Co adatom and S was the reason to significantly promote the increase of HER activity (Fig. 8d-8f). Non-metallic dopants can also interact with 1T-MoS2 and act as electron donors, thus improving the stability of 1T phase and HER activity. For instance, Xiong et al. prepared a phosphorous-doped 1T-MoS2 supported on N, P, S-codoped hierarchical carbon microflower (P-MoS2@HCMF) which possessed a series of advantages such as high concentration 1T phase, defective structure, P doping and high conductive carbon material as support [116]. Hence, an ultra-small η10 of only 86 mV and a small Tafel slope of 42.35 mV dec−1 for P-MoS2@HCMF in acidic electrolyte was obtained. Since the Tafel slope is close to 40 mV dec−1, it indicates that the HER mechanism proceeded along the Volmer-Heyrovsky path, and the Heyrovsky step was the rate-determining step in the whole process. The XPS characterization results showed that P dopants in 1T-MoS2 mainly played the role of electron donor because P has a smaller electronegativity than S, thus resulting an extraordinary stability of P-MoS2@HCMF."
15,Defect-rich 1T-MoS2/carbon material composites,"4.3 Defect-rich 1T-MoS2/carbon material composites Although the electrical conductivity of MoS2 has been greatly improved from 2H phase to 1T phase, it can also be grown on the conductive carrier to further improve the electrical conductivity and expose more active sites. For example, Jayabal et al. developed defect-rich 1T-MoS2/carbon nanotubes (defect-rich 1T-MoS2/CNTs) which showed a low overpotential of 173 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1 [104]. The excellent HER performance was attributed to the synergy effects between 1T-MoS2 and carbon nanotubes, which induced a high electronic conductivity, defect-rich structure and a large number of active sites. The theoretical calculation results also showed that the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) was smaller than that of defect 1T-MoS2 and pure 1T-MoS2. Besides, a good stability was exhibited due to the negligible loss of activity after 1000 cycles. Zhang et al. integrated 1T-2H MoS2 nanosheets with a 3D porous N-doped graphene with highly exposed active sites, enhanced conductivity and excellent HER activity in acidic media [115]. This hybrid catalyst had a small η10 of 157 mV, a low Tafel slope of 45.8 mV dec−1 and a large TOF value of 1.51 s−1 at 0.15 V (Fig. 8g-8j). Zeng et al. prepared a stable 1 T-MoS2 monolayer formed at edge aligned 2H-MoS2 and a reduced graphene oxide heterointerface (EA-2H/1T/RGO) by a precursor-in-solvent strategy [117]. The EA-2H/1T/RGO displayed a small η10 of 186 mV, Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−1 and an excellent stability of 10 h in acidic media. The superior activity was attributed to defect formation during 2H-to-1T phase transition, which decreased the ΔGH to 0.07 eV. In addition, the good stability was caused by the interfacial charge transfer between MoS2 and graphene. Carbon cloth (CC) is also an excellent conductive support for the vertical growth of MoS2 nanosheets. Liu et al. fabricated 1T-MoS2 with defects vertically supported on CC which exhibited a small η10 of 151 mV and Tafel slope of 55 mV dec−1. The excellent HER performance was assigned to the high conductivity and proliferated active sites of 1T phase. At the same time, the self-supported structure of catalyst provided a large number of accessible active sites and facilitated the charger transfer [118]. The above works provide new insights for us to design HER catalyst with better performance and study the synergistic effect between MoS2 and carbon materials. Table 1 lists the recent HER performance (η10, Tafel slope and stability) of defect-rich 1T-MoS2 based catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It can be clearly seen that although 1T phase and rich defects can improve the HER performance of MoS2, the activities of most bare defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts are not very high. However, the HER activity can be further enhanced by integrating defect-rich 1T-MoS2 with conductive carbon to form hybrid self-supported materials. More interestingly, elemental doping is a more efficient way to significantly improve the HER activity of defect-rich 1T-MoS2. The best activity in the reported literatures was observed on a single-atom Co array doped distorted 1T-MoS2 catalyst, which had the lowest η10 of 42 mV and smallest Tafel slope of 32 mV dec−1."
16,Summary and outlook,"In this review, we introduced the crystal structure and defect types of MoS2 firstly, then listed in detail how to confirm the existence of 1T-MoS2 and defects through some advanced characterization means and also quantitatively obtain the concentration of 1T phase and the number of defects. Next, the synthesis method to prepare defect-rich 1T-MoS2 materials were introduced, which mainly including top-down, bottom-up and novel synthesis strategies. Among them, hydrothermal method is the most widely used and easiest approach to synthesize defect-rich 1T-MoS2. The key to this method is the addition of excessive S source, suitable hydrothermal temperature, and the generation of a large number of intercalated NH3 molecules. Finally, we summarized the HER performance of bare, elemental doped and carbon materials integrated defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts, respectively. Interestingly, doping elements is the most efficient way to significantly improve the HER activity. However, there are still some bottlenecks for the development of more efficient defect-rich 1T-MoS2 HER catalysts, and these problems point out the future research directions: (1) Developing simpler and safer exfoliation methods to prepare defect-rich 1T-MoS2. In this case, we could firstly adopt a mild exfoliation method such as using alcohols as exfoliating reagent to prepare high purity 1T-MoS2, and then utilize etching methods for post-treatment to produce a large number of defect sites. (2) Improving the stability of 1T-MoS2 phase induced by NH3 intercalation. (3) Precise and controllable synthesis of defects, in-depth mechanism investigation about the influence of defect type and content on the HER performance. (4) Combining the advantages of elemental doping and integration with conductive support to prepare more efficient defect-rich 1T-MoS2 catalysts. This review also provides insights for designing defect-rich 1T-MoS2 materials in other related energy conversion and storage applications."
