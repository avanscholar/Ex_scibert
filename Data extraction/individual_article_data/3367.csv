1,Epidemiological evidence linking alcohol consumption and cancer,"1.1 Epidemiological evidence linking alcohol consumption and cancer Over 2 million deaths worldwide are attributable to alcohol use and alcohol-related diseases and injuries [1]. Most known among these is the alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which accounts for almost half of the deaths caused by cirrhosis and represents a major public health concern [2]. Another group of diseases linked to chronic alcohol consumption and a cause for significant concerns is cancer. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), sufficient evidence is available showing that alcohol consumption has a causative effect in a number of cancers, such as cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colorectum, liver (hepatocellular carcinoma), cervix and female breast [3,4]. For some malignancies, such as most of lymphomas and leukemias, an inverse association with alcohol consumption was found, while for kidney, urinary bladder and ovarian cancers no association was noted. For stomach, pancreas, lung endometrium, brain, thyroid and melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers the data were inconclusive [4]. A more recent statement from the UK's Committee on Carcinogenicity in 2016 confirmed that alcohol is a risk factor for cancers listed above [5]. Overall, the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers is 6% higher than in men who consume less than two alcoholic drinks per day or in women who consume less than one alcoholic drink per day [6]. The lack of understanding of the mechanisms induced by heavy drinking and of the individual susceptibilities to alcohol effects impedes prevention, early detection and treatment of alcohol related cancers. This review focusses on the role of sphingolipids in mediating alcohol effects, including the increased cancer risk."
2,Molecular mechanisms linking effects of alcohol and cancer,"1.2 Molecular mechanisms linking effects of alcohol and cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most studied malignancies linked to alcohol consumption [4]. Although several pathways involved in development of HCC in response to alcohol have been established, the biological mechanisms by which alcohol induces cancer are not completely understood. Genotoxic effects of acetaldehyde (an alcohol metabolite), oxidative stress, retinoid metabolism, one-carbon metabolism and methylation, sphingolipid signaling, local effects of alcohol itself, and sex hormones are believed to contribute to the carcinogenic effect of alcohol (Fig. 1 ) [4]. Mechanisms of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis are inherently linked to its metabolism. Ethanol is easily miscible with water and its absorption starts in the upper digestive tract mucosa. The majority is absorbed by the small intestine via simple diffusion. The presence of food in the digestive tract lowers alcohol absorption rate. Absorbed ethanol distributes into the blood volume, which lowers its concentration, depending on the body mass or, rather, blood volume. More than 90% of ingested alcohol is metabolized by the liver and the remaining part is metabolized by the gastrointestinal mucosa and bacteria, by kidneys and peripheral tissues or excreted via urine and sweat [4]. It should be noted, that the body itself produces small quantities of ethanol during normal cellular metabolism [4]. In all cells, metabolism of ethanol proceeds first to acetaldehyde, then further to acetic acid. Three enzymatic systems can complete the first step: i) alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH, seven enzymes subdivided into 5 classes, with differential tissue expression); ii) cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) which is constitutively expressed in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of many tissues; and iii) catalase, which is constitutively expressed in the peroxisomal part of the ER. Acetaldehyde can also be produced endogenously by several metabolic pathways, but in such low amounts, that without ingested alcohol, its levels are not detected in blood. The major portion of acetaldehyde formed in the liver is directly oxidized by NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases to acetate, which can further be used for acetyl-CoA synthesis and oxidized by mitochondria to CO2. A minor contribution of CYP2E1 and other oxidases has also been noted [4]. Finally, alcohol can be used for esterification of fatty acids by fatty-acid ethyl ester synthases and by acyl-CoA: ethanol O-acyltransferase, though their contributions are small [4]. Acetaldehyde, the first intermediate in ethanol degradation pathways is a highly reactive compound capable of forming adducts with DNA bases (most often with guanine) and Schiff-bases with amino groups of proteins and other molecules, thus affecting their function. Convincing evidence has accumulated that the carcinogenic effect of ethanol on the upper aerodigestive tract is a result of its multiple mutagenic effects on DNA [7]. Among these effects are point mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase locus in human lymphocytes, sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, interference with DNA repair machinery by inhibition of O6-methyl-guanyltransferase (which is involved in alkyl-adducts repair), delays in cell cycle progression, and an increase of inflammation and metaplasia of tracheal epithelium [8,9]. The extent of such damage depends on acetaldehyde concentrations after alcohol ingestion which, in turn, depends on the amount of the alcohol ingested and on the activity of the major acetaldehyde oxidizing enzyme ALDH2 [7]. Individuals with inactive ALDH2 have an increased risk of several cancer types because acetaldehyde accumulates after alcohol consumption [10]. An additional toxic effect of acetaldehyde is the increase of intestinal permeability to the gut bacteria lipopolysaccharide (endotoxins), which enters the blood and travels to the liver. Chronic hepatocellular injury by ethanol also increases sensitivity of Kupfer cells to endotoxins that activate TLR signaling through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in chronic release of TNFα. This inflammatory signal is transmitted via the NF-κB pathway [11], enhances fibrosis and ultimately leads to development of cirrhosis. Chronic liver cirrhosis associated with prolonged heavy drinking typically develops well before HCC. Therefore, associations between alcohol and HCC are typically found in heavy drinkers and overall, the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and hepatocellular carcinoma is linear [6]. While mechanisms involving acetaldehyde may be major players in some cancers, they could be less important in hepatocellular carcinoma since hepatocytes are more efficient in clearing acetaldehyde [12]. Experimental data suggest that oxidative stress, together with cirrhosis, lead to liver carcinogenesis [13]. One of the sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be increased leakage of electrons from respiratory chain oxidizing increased levels of NADH generated by oxidation of alcohol [14]. Another source of ROS could be the TNFα-induced activation of sphingomyelinase, accumulation of ceramide and inhibition of the electron transport chain [7]. TNFα is thought to be a major contributor to hepatotoxicity of alcohol [15]. Moreover, chronic ethanol consumption induces cytochrome CYP2E1, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and ultimately DNA damage [16]. Suppression of retinoids activity is another mechanism leading to cancer. Retinoids are fat soluble compounds with vitamin A activity and chronic alcohol consumption was shown to decrease vitamin A and retinoic acid concentrations in the liver [17]. Retinoic acid bound to its nuclear receptors RaR/RxR regulates gene transcription suppressing proliferation/migration and stimulating differentiation programs. Therefore, deficiency in retinoic acid will support cell proliferation, migration, and malignant transformation [7]. Alcohol impacts multiple steps of vitamin A metabolism, including decrease of retinol absorption and increased retinol mobilization from the liver to other organs [17], as well as competing for ALD and reducing retinoic acid biosynthesis from retinol [18]. An inverse relationship between serum vitamin A levels and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma has been observed [19]. Another essential nutrient playing role in alcohol-induced carcinogenesis is folate, the coenzyme enabling one carbon metabolism, and alcohol consumption was shown to result in folate deficiency [20]. The vitamin supports multiple biochemical pathways relevant for carcinogenesis, but DNA methylation is, likely, most prominent target in folate-mediated effects of ethanol [21]. Alcohol can affect DNA methylation in multiple ways: by inhibiting the activity and/or expression of enzymes involved in DNA methylation [22] or through inhibition of methionine synthase and reducing availability of the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) [23]. Irreversible epigenetic alterations of certain genes can lead to tumorigenesis [24]. Importantly, polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA methylation [22] can further exacerbate effects of alcohol. Thus, variants of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which are commonly investigated in relation to folate metabolism, increase the association with breast and oral cancer at daily consumption of two drinks or more [25]. Mechanisms involving the local direct effects of alcohol in the body have also been investigated. Concentrated alcoholic beverages can have direct toxic effect on the esophageal epithelial cells causing their death and increasing inflammation [4]. On the other hand, alcohol could increase the transport of carcinogenic compounds through mucosa and thus contribute to carcinogenesis by increasing their solubility [9]."
3,Alcohol and sphingolipids,"Excessive consumption of alcohol leads to steatohepatitis and development of chronic alcohol-related liver disease [26]. The development and progression of alcoholic liver disease involve significant metabolic changes, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, with additional effects being associated with insulin resistance and several hormones. In recent years, the disturbance of sphingolipid metabolism and accumulation of ceramide has gained increased attention as a contributor to both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases [27], and the consequences of ethanol consumption have been partially attributed to the actions of sphingolipids, a class of bioactive lipids with diverse roles in cellular functions including signaling, apoptosis, and senescence [28]."
4,Sphingolipids and cancer,"2.1 Sphingolipids and cancer Sphingolipids are the second largest class of membrane lipids with a common structural element, the sphingoid base present in all members of this class [29]. They are found in eukaryotic cell membranes, comprising about 10–20% of membrane lipids [30], and are more abundant in plasma membranes than intracellular membranes [31]. In addition, sphingolipids are selectively enriched in one of the membrane leaflets which creates a unique lateral asymmetry [32] that supports specific functions of the membrane. Sphingolipids can be made de novo in all cells. The biosynthetic pathway starts from condensation of the amino acid serine and palmitoyl-CoA leading to the formation of 3-ketosphinganine (Fig. 2 ). After the reduction to sphinganine and following the acylation by Acyl-CoA catalyzed by ceramide synthase (CerS), the dihydroceramide is formed, which is further converted to ceramide by the activity of dihydroceramide desaturase. Ceramide is a central molecule in sphingolipid metabolism, since all complex sphingolipids as well as sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate can be generated from and converted back to ceramide [29]. More than 200 structurally different ceramides can be produced in the cell and the concept of “many ceramides” was proposed for investigating their function [33]. This concept calls for investigation of the temporal and spatial dynamics of different ceramide species, identifying cellular compartments where the changes occur and specific pathways leading to such changes. It is well established, that ceramides are integral components of the biological membranes. They confer unique biophysical properties to the membranes [34], and the function of ceramides as second messengers controlling fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, stress adaptation, differentiation, survival and senescence has been extensively investigated [29,35]. Moreover, ceramide metabolites, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are also signaling lipids playing distinct roles in the cell [36]. It is believed, that not just ceramide signaling, but also the S1P levels (“sphingolipid rheostat” mechanism [37]) determine the overall cellular response to stimuli. In the past two decades, numerous studies linked ceramides to cancer initiation and progression. Cancers commonly have altered levels of sphingolipids, but the role and mechanisms of these alterations are still not clear [38]. Of note, ceramides have been evaluated as markers for cancer resistance and as important biomarkers in cancer therapy [39,40]."
5,Alcohol and sphingolipids,"2.2 Alcohol and sphingolipids As membrane constituents, sphingolipids form a physical barrier of the cell [41,42], as well as maintain membrane fluidity. Exposure to ethanol was shown to significantly alter the levels of different sphingolipid classes including ceramides and sphingomyelins (SM) [42,43]. Sphingomyelins can be converted to ceramide with release of a phosphorylcholine head group by the activity of sphingomyelinase (SMase). Three major isoforms of sphingomyelinase with distinct subcellular localizations have been identified: acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), alkaline sphingomyelinase, and neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), based on the pH optimum for enzymatic activity. Another isoform, secretory sphingomyelinase (SASMase) is derived from the acid sphingomyelinase gene but is found in the extracellular space and can also function at neutral pH. Interestingly, in the liver, ASMase and NSMase-2 are involved in fatty liver disease [27]. While sphingomyelinases produce ceramide from sphingomyelin, ceramide can also be degraded to sphingosine and acyl-CoA by ceramidases [44], and sphingosine can be further phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to S1P. The latter has been implicated in the progression from steatosis to advanced fibrosis [45]. An additional way to clear ceramide from the cell is to use it for synthesis of sphingomyelin, or hexosyl-ceramide. Three sphingomyelin synthases are localized in the Golgi, plasma membrane and in the ER, while glucosylceramide transferase is found in Golgi. Emerging evidence suggests that enzymes converting SM and ceramide could be mediating the hepatotoxic effects of ethanol [27]. In human plasma, the activity of SASMase was increased following chronic alcohol consumption up to 3-fold compared to the levels in healthy controls [46]. During an abstinence period, SASMase activity declined significantly and was near normal levels after one week of physical withdrawal of ethanol [46]. Another study found elevated SASMase activity in early abstinent alcohol-dependent patients and approximately 1.5-fold higher enzyme levels compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, enzymatic activity was 11% higher in males than females for both alcohol-dependent patients and controls. In males, blood alcohol levels also correlated with SASMase activity suggesting that it could be an important biomarker of intoxication levels [1]. SASMase activity also correlated with the activities of liver enzymes that are known to be changed by alcohol consumption including GGT, ALT, and AST [1]. In contrast to other studies that have found a return of ASMase activity to near normal levels, in this study investigators found that ASMase levels decreased during withdrawal treatment but were still higher than those found in control subjects [1], but there was no information on the alcohol-dependent patients enzyme levels before the pattern of alcohol consumption started. In a separate study, levels of the lysosomal ASMase were found elevated in alcohol dependence but they returned to normal during withdrawal period [47]. These human studies provide compelling data for the involvement of sphingomyelinases in the liver response to alcohol. It should be noted, that activation of ASMase and generation of C16-ceramide could be sensitizing hepatocytes to the effects of TNF-α [48], as well as activating autophagy in stellate cells as part of their activation to a myofibroblastic phenotype, which may contribute to development of liver fibrosis [49]. However, the role of ASMase in regulating autophagy and the downstream consequences are complex and not fully understood. Rodent models of alcohol consumption have revealed similar findings to human studies with increased ASMase activity in mouse and rat tissues after exposure to ethanol [50,51]. In rats, addition of N-acetylcysteine to the ethanol treatment reduced ASMase activity, steatosis and inflammation, implicating oxidative stress as one of the drivers of the enzyme activation. However, this supplementation was inefficient in improving insulin signaling, or restoring GM3 synthase levels, pointing to the “dual independent” mechanisms of hepatosteatitis [52]. Naturally, ASMase KO mice were resistant to alcohol-mediated fatty liver and cell death [53]. Beyond the investigation of the activity of acid sphingomyelinases, rodent models have been used to study other aspects of sphingolipid metabolism upon short and long-term alcohol exposure. To generally classify changes in metabolites upon chronic alcohol intake, rat serum lipid profiles were assessed after chronic alcohol intake [54]. Significant changes in diacylglycerols, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol [55], and a shift in lipid balance, with increased sphingolipids and glycerolipids but decreased glycerophospholipids were observed. Glucosyl-ceramide was also slightly upregulated in these animals. In addition to the types of lipids that were changed, it was found that alcohol consumption led to a significant re-distribution of sphingolipids with different acyl chains lengths in both male and female rats and showed a trend for decreased total degree of acyl chain saturation. Chain length and degree of saturation are important to consider in lipids because they can affect membrane biophysical properties and modify membrane-bound protein activity and lipid rafts [54,55]. In a recent study, effects of alcohol were examined in rats treated with Myriocin (MYR), a potent inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase [56]. This enzyme catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. MYR reduced the hepatic lipid and ceramide levels, the size and abundance of the lipid droplets (hallmarks of steatohepatitis), as well as ER stress in hepatocytes. Additionally, it improved the insulin sensitivity of ethanol treated livers and reduced blood glucose levels in treated animals, thus partially alleviating the detrimental effects of ethanol [54]. Accumulation of liver ceramide in response to chronic exposure to ethanol has been known for some time [51], along with concomitant increase in several sphingolipid biosynthesis genes including ceramide synthases and ceramidase [57–59]. However, the detailed mechanisms and biological role of these alterations are still not clear. Thus, elevation of ceramides with C14, C16 and C18 acyl chain lengths was observed in rats [60], while in mice the increase of very long chain ceramides, in response to ethanol, has been reported [53,61]. Similarly, elevation of C14, C16, C18 and C20 ceramides was found in a group of human patients with alcoholic liver disease [42]. The exact source of the ceramide elevation was not determined, however both sphingomyelinase and de novo pathways were implicated [42,56,62]. Studies of human liver biopsies revealed that chronic alcohol consumption leads to overall dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism and increased expression of multiple sphingolipid enzymes such as ceramide synthases 1, 5, and 6, glycosyl-ceramide synthase and GM3 synthase, as well as reduced expression of ceramidase 2 [42]. Overall, elevation of ceramides, and especially long-chain ceramides, promotes apoptosis in hepatic tissue contributing to liver injury which should activate immune cells leading to development of pro-inflammatory environment. Another sphingolipid with established involvement in cancer is S1P. It is generally viewed as the pro-survival metabolite counteracting the pro-death effects of ceramide [39]. This signaling lipid was shown to increase activation and migration of hepatic stellate cells, facilitate hepatocyte regeneration, induce angiogenesis and activate production of pro-fibrotic molecules [63]. It also has prominent role in inflammation [64], a major underlying cause of HCC [65]. Interestingly, in a recent series of publications ethanol was shown to promote tumor development in diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN) treated mice [57–59]. The tumor-promoting effect was accompanied by the development of steatohepatitis, fibrosis and activation of Wnt-β-catenin-dependent hepatocyte proliferation, as well as an accumulation of long-chain ceramides, especially C18. In a different study of a similar model, increased expression of cyclin D1 and p53, loss of miR-122, activation of epithelial mesenchymal transition and activation of hedgehog signaling were found [66]. Additionally, elevation of acid ceramidase, sphingosine kinase (SK1) and S1P receptors 1, 2, and 3 (which break ceramide to acyl-CoA and sphingosine, phosphorylate the latter to S1P and increase receptors for the S1P recognition and signaling) were also observed upon ethanol treatment of DEN-induced mice [59]. Soy-protein isolate, when simultaneously added to the diet, resulted in the reduction of tumorigenesis accompanied by reduced C18-ceramide levels, as well as prevented ethanol-induced ceramidase-S1P-S1PR signaling, thus implicating S1P-signaling in tumor promotion. Similar alterations of sphingolipid metabolism could promote tumorigenesis under chronic consumption of alcohol alone, in which case the tumor-initiating factor would be the DNA damage by the alcohol metabolite acetaldehyde. However, these mechanisms have not been experimentally linked together."
6,Sphingolipids and NAFLD,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and, if untreated, to HCC, results from dyslipidemia and lipotoxicity caused by insulin resistance, and is strongly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes [67,68]. Symptomatically and histologically, it proceeds similarly to alcoholic liver disease and sphingolipids play a prominent role in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD and NASH. Chronic elevation of ceramide levels in hepatocytes is linked to onset and progression of NASH, and predominant mechanism of this elevation is the activation of SPT and the de novo pathway [69]. However, sphingomyelinase pathway also contributes to increase in ceramide levels [68]. The exact mechanisms driving progression from steatosis to NASH are not well established, but evidence suggests that ceramide mediates many of the harmful effects of excess fatty acids [70]. Investigation of the roles of CerSes, and specifically of CerS6, could improve our understanding of ceramide function in both ALD and NASH and provide novel opportunities for treatment/management of these diseases. Recent study investigating the ceramide function in cellular stress response underscored the role of the tumor suppressor p53 both in the regulation of ceramide and in mediating its effects [71–74]."
7,Alcohol effects and p53,
8,p53 as a transcriptional regulator,"4.1 p53 as a transcriptional regulator p53 protein, a short-lived transcription factor, which regulates hundreds of genes to control diverse cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, epigenetic modifications, and telomeres shortening [75]. p53 has also indirect inhibitory effects on genes via binding certain transcription factors and preventing their transactivation function, or via regulation of certain miRNAs and lincRNAs [76]. Context-dependent posttranslational modifications of p53, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation and a few others, define its interaction with specific gene targets [77]. For example, TAF1, the largest subunit of transcription factor TFIID that is involved in cell cycle regulation, mediates phosphorylation of Thr-55 preventing binding of p53 to its target promotors [78]. Targeting of specific promoters by p53 can also be affected by the epigenetic modifications of the gene [79]. Acting as a transcription factor, p53 controls multiple metabolic pathways, including serine metabolism, glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, redox status and lipid metabolism [80]."
9,p53 in tumor suppression,"4.2 p53 in tumor suppression The facts that p53 is mutated in over half of human cancers and that p53 (−/−) mice spontaneously develop tumors established the protein's function in tumor suppression [81,82]. However, the mechanisms of how p53 accomplishes tumor suppression are not completely understood. It was believed that induction of apoptotic death in nascent neoplastic cells was one of the primary mechanisms by which p53 prevents tumor development [83]. Also, it was thought that p53-mediated cell cycle arrest allowed cells to repair DNA damage before progressing through the cell cycle and therefore prevented the propagation of oncogenic mutations [81]. Recently, this hypothesis has been countered by experiments in knockout mice. Mice deficient in CDK inhibitor p21, a downstream target of p53 inducing the cell cycle arrest and senescence, do not develop tumors spontaneously [84]. Additionally, mice deficient in p53 effectors of apoptosis, PUMA and NOXA, were monitored over a long time period and no spontaneous development of tumors was observed [85]. However, knock-in mice expressing mutant p53 variants have further implicated cell cycle arrest in p53-mediated tumor suppression [86]. Mice expressing p53 R172P (the mouse equivalent of R175P in humans) or p53 E177R (the mouse equivalent of E180R in humans) were partially protected from early-onset lymphomas despite being compromised in apoptosis [87,88]. p53 tumor suppressor activity likely involves a combination of mechanisms due to its vast number of transcriptional targets and its ability to control many cellular pathways. It has been speculated that p53 tumor suppressor function could be explained by the plasticity of p53 signaling, cell-type or context-specific difference, and importance of non-canonical p53 activities. It is possible that the ability of p53 to regulate other cellular processes, such as genomic stability, metabolism, and stemness is most critical for tumor suppression [81]. Tumor development is associated with metabolic reprogramming, which allows cancer cells to grow and proliferate without limits. Transcriptional activity of p53 which prevents such reprogramming will put a limit on cancer cells growth."
10,Alcohol and p53,"4.3 Alcohol and p53 It is known that p53 has broad-spectrum effects on reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and cellular metabolism, but its exact role in alcohol-induced carcinogenesis is not understood. There is evidence that the activation of p53 is needed for ethanol-induced apoptosis [89]. p53 levels increased and bcl-2 levels decreased when rat midbrain cells were exposed to alcohol and acetaldehyde in culture [90]. Additionally, chronic ethanol exposure in rats was shown to increase the hepatic p53 mRNA abundance, as well as acetylation, and transcriptional activity of the protein [91,92]. Robust nuclear accumulation of p53 during chronic ethanol feeding has been reported [93]. Chronic ethanol exposure of different rat strains promoted hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and PTEN expression, which contribute to apoptosis and diminished insulin signaling in the liver [91]. Liver-specific deletion of PTEN ameliorated hepatocellular damage induced by chronic alcohol consumption [94]. Also, it has been reported that genetic elimination of p53 prevents ethanol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis [89]. Similarly, p53 (−/−) MEF cells were, unlike wild type cells, completely insensitive up to 0.5 M ethanol in the culture medium [89]. There is increasing evidence for the link between alcohol and p53 in the central nervous system, and p53 serves as a central hub of the ethanol-induced dysregulation of brain cell functions. Thus, it has been shown that alcohol-induced changes in genes related to p53 signaling can be detected in the peripheral blood and may serve as a useful biomarker for CNS structural damage and functional performance deficits [95]. A heterogeneity of p53 response to alcohol exposure that varies depending on the brain subregion was also observed [96]. Gene network analysis of ethanol exposed animals suggested that p53 regulates gene networks related to the development of neuronal projections [96]. Importantly, in this study p53 knockout mice did not show rescue from alcohol-induced apoptosis in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. In a different study, ethanol exacerbated manganese-induced neuro-inflammation and apoptosis in the hypothalamus of rats via regulation of the NF-κB/p53 signaling pathway [97]. The hypothalamus is especially prone to alcohol toxicity [98]. Exposure of rats to manganese, ethanol, or their combination resulted in reduced activities of anti-oxidant enzymes, a lower level of reduced glutathione, downregulated Bcl-2 expression, elevated hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels, and upregulated expression of p53, Bax, and caspase-3 [99]. In neural stem cells, ethanol and TGFβ1 affected proliferation, DNA repair, and survival via p53 mediated activities [100]. In a recent study, p53 status, ethanol exposure, and growth factors significantly altered the expression of transcripts related to the DNA damage response, mitotic promoters, and regulators of cell death via the tumor necrosis factor pathway [100]. Ethanol exposure did not affect the proportion of cycling neuro stem cells, but it reduced the proportion of cells undergoing DNA synthesis in the presence of TGFβ1. Importantly, p53 silencing potentiated ethanol and TGFβ1-induced changes, indicating that p53 is not required for ethanol- or TGFβ1-induced cell cycle restriction. Interestingly, in neural crest cells, exposure to ethanol dramatically increased the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, a response known to interfere with p53 and MDM2 interaction, leading to the accumulation of p53 [101]. Furthermore, miR-125b was shown to modulate ethanol-induced apoptosis in neural crest cells by targeting downstream targets of p53, Bak 1 and PUMA [102]. Also, microinjection of a miR-125b-mimic into cultured mouse embryos prevented ethanol-induced embryotoxicity. Other miRNAs could also be involved in cell death induced by ethanol exposure [103,104]. One of the mechanisms of the alcohol-dependent activation of p53 could be alcohol-induced increase in 4-HNE with subsequent accumulation of 4-HNE-Sirt1 protein adducts and reduced SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of p53 demonstrated in rat endothelial cells [105]. Acetylation of p53 within its DNA-binding and C-terminal domains was shown to block protein interactions with Mdm2, MdmX, E1A, Rad23 and other important cellular regulators [106]. Hyperacetylation of p53 due to inhibition of SIRT1 was also demonstrated in liver along with reduced levels of SIRT5 in liver mitochondria leading to hyperacetylation of PGC-1α and both contributing to liver injury [92]. Acetaldehyde-induced DNA damage in hematopoietic stem cells was found to promote cellular decline and damage accumulation, which led to initiation of malignancies [107]. Hematopoietic stem cells mutated by acetaldehyde are functionally compromised and display myeloid bias. The p53 response is critical in driving the loss in number and function of hematopoietic stem cells. Deletion of p53 rescues the survival of acetaldehyde-stressed and mutated hematopoietic stem cells, but did not increase genomic instability at the single hematopoietic stem cell level [107]. It is believed that depletion of SAM could also be one of the mediators of the cellular effects of alcohol. Experiments in rats demonstrated that feeding animals Lieber-DeCarli diet for 4 weeks led to genomic DNA hypomethylation in colonic mucosa, without changing the methylation of p53 or actin DNA loci [108]. Nevertheless, experiments in rodents indicate that ethanol exposure can affect p53 by epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation), transmitted through the germline in offspring exposed in utero or as a result of paternal exposure [109,110]. Ancestral exposure to alcohol can have enduring effects that impact epigenetic processes that control expression of genes involved in cancer development. Thus, when controlled for both paternal and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, familial alcohol dependence was associated with hypermethylation of the TP53 gene [111]."
11,Sphingolipids and p53,"Sphingolipids and p53 are important regulators and collaborators of cell-fate decisions [112]. Biologically active sphingolipids and enzymes related to sphingolipid metabolism are altered in cancer, indicating roles for these pathways in cancer pathogenesis and progression [113]. Various stress stimuli induce accumulation of ceramide in numerous experimental models leading to apoptosis. However, the exact mechanisms of the generation and regulatory role of ceramide during apoptosis are not completely understood [114]. It has been proposed that p53 and ceramide have similar biological functions, and the involvement of p53 in ceramide mediated induction of apoptosis was investigated [115]. Chemotherapeutic agents or gamma irradiation induced p53-dependent ceramide accumulation and apoptosis in Molt-4 leukemia cells. In this specific study, it was suggested that p53 functions upstream of ceramide accumulation. Further analysis has shown that sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes function both upstream and downstream of p53 activation [112]. p53 was shown to be involved in the regulation of several sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes, including neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), ceramide synthase 5 (CerS5), ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6), and alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2). DNA damage induced by doxorubicin treatment of MCF7 breast cancer cells resulted in upregulation of nSMase2 and ceramide accumulation leading to growth arrest [116]. It was found that these effects were the result of direct transcriptional activation of nSMase2 by p53 via a novel transcription start site upstream of exon 3. Another sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme, ACER2, is upregulated upon ionizing radiation, reducing ceramide levels via its hydrolysis to sphingosine, which was then phosphorylated to form S1P [117]. Involvement of p53 in this regulation was inferred from the fact that ACER2 mRNA levels and its enzymatic activity were increased by ionizing radiation in a dose-dependent manner in the WT p53 harboring HCT 116 cells, but not in isogenic p53 deficient cells [118]. Two p53 response elements were found in the first intron of ACER2 gene and their activity was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter activity assays [118]. p53-dependent activation of ACER2 in DNA damage response supports its tumor-suppressive role and explains its frequent mutation or deletion in cancers [118]. Another link between p53 and de novo sphingolipid pathway has been recently investigated in cellular response to inadequate folate metabolism [71]. The vitamin deprivation or disruption of folate metabolism in cultured cells led to a p53-dependent upregulation of CerS6 and accumulation of long chain ceramides [71]. Responsible for the biosynthesis of C14- and C16- ceramide, CerS6 has been shown to be a direct transcriptional target of p53 in response to folate withdrawal [73]. Luciferase assays demonstrated that the CerS6 promoter reporter was activated by p53 expression in A549 cells, but not by a transcriptionally inactive p53 mutant. Direct binding of pure recombinant p53 to a non-canonical p53 binding site in the CerS6 promoter 11 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays [73]. Interestingly, CerS6-produced C16-ceramide was shown to bind directly to p53, disrupting the protein interaction with negative regulator MDM2 and resulting in p53 accumulation. This interaction was specific to C16-ceramide and was shown to be a general mechanism of p53 elevation in response to metabolic stress, including serum deprivation [74], and could operate as a signal amplification loop to generate swift response. It should be noted that these mechanisms were not activated by upregulation of any other CerSes, including CerS5 [74]. Recently, CerS5 was shown to be upregulated by the oxaliplatin or 5-fluorouracil treatments in HCT116 cells expressing wild type p53, but not in p53-deficient cells and this activation was linked to increased levels of C16-ceramide [119]. It was concluded that the increase in CerS5 expression occurred by stabilization of CerS5 mRNA at the 3′-UTR and it was speculated that miR-34a or miR-150 could be involved. In another study, gamma irradiation exposure of cancer cells resulted in p53 activation and transcriptional upregulation of CerS5, but not SPT [120]. The mechanisms of enzyme upregulation were not established. So far, CerS6 is the only ceramide synthase, for which the direct binding of p53 to its promoter was shown [73]. Overall, current research indicates that alcohol exposure, acting through multiple mechanisms, induces cellular genotoxic and metabolic stress which are sensed by p53. As a result, p53 activates a context- and time-dependent response, which involves generation of sphingolipid second messengers (Fig. 3 ). However, a precise understanding of each of the steps in response to alcohol is still lacking. For example, multiple mechanisms, such as genotoxic stress, ROS generation, hyperacetylation of the protein, ceramide generation by nSMase or CerS6 and others, could activate p53 upon alcohol exposure, and the response mounted by activated p53 would be dependent on the amplitude of such activation as well as the specific cellular context. Elevation of ceramide (via nSMase 2, CerS5 or CerS6) is expected to induce cell growth arrest, senescence or apoptosis, which in general, should prevent growth of transformed cells. However, simultaneous activation of ACER2 by p53 (or other mechanisms) will promote the conversion of generated ceramide to sphingosine and subsequently, to S1P, a proliferation and inflammation promoter. Thus, growth-suppressing signals could subsequently, depending on additional factors, lead to a proliferatory and inflammatory phenotype conducive to carcinogenesis. Alternatively, promotion of cell death by elevated ceramide could activate immune cells to clear tissues from cell debris, which will also promote inflammation and stimulate proliferation. While currently, there is no data to support these putative mechanisms of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis, evidence for a relationship between alcohol and p53 activation, as well as for the link between p53 and sphingolipids does exist. Thus, it is not difficult to imagine that the two relationships could be intertwined in complex p53- andsphingolipid-dependent pathways in which alcohol consumption leads to cancer."
12,Summary,"Numerous studies demonstrate negative effects of chronic alcohol use on the normal organ and cells function and identify major pathways activated by this exposure that lead to the dysfunction. Multiple correlation studies in humans and experimental animal models indicate that there is a causal link between chronic alcohol exposure and cancer. Several mechanisms have been considered but precise pathways and their connections have not been established. Recent interest in sphingolipids, which are increasingly studied in cancer, as well as new data on the cooperation of the ceramide and tumor suppressor p53, open new avenues for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms leading from alcohol damage to cancer and for the identification of actionable targets suitable for treatment and/or management of alcohol-related damage, including cancer."
