0,Introduction,"The transition metal-derived heterogeneous catalysts generally afford the limited catalytic activity due to their intrinsic natural property. In comparison, noble metal-based catalyst exhibits the huge attraction in heterogeneous catalysis due to their remarkable catalytic redox performance [1–10]. However, the high-cost and scarcity of noble metal inevitably impede their further large-scale industrial application prospects. Therefore, some scientists have proposed the dispersed tactics for the noble metal catalysts so as to enhance the dispersity and atom-efficiency of catalytic active species in the catalytic reaction [2,3,5,7–9]. Because those well-dispersed supported metal catalysts have been demonstrated to be highly-efficient for many catalytic conversions by making the most of the catalytic active atoms during the reaction process. So far, various noble metal particles have been tentatively tailored into nanometer size through the controlled synthesis tactics to obtain activity-improved catalysts [11–14]. However, to our knowledge, pony-sized noble metal-based catalyst tended to easily be aggregated into bulk particles owing to their high surface energy, accordingly causing the inferior catalytic activity. While the combination of support with nanoparticles can be capable of stabilizing these nanoparticles and efficiently prohibiting the further aggregation of metal species [15–18]. However, it should be noted that this process required an enough large surface to afford these highly-dispersed active atoms, more importantly, the support surface must be adequately suitable for stabilizing these high-energy of active species through special interaction for avoiding their further immigration and aggregation during the reaction. Mesoporous oxide materials undoubtedly can be considered as the ideal carrier for supporting and stabilizing those noble active species to obtain the desirable catalyst due to its high surface area, ordered mesochannel, and enriched surface oxygen species [19–22]. Especially, the metal species can be incorporated into sols precursor of the matrix during the synthesis process to set up a strong metal-support medium for gaining a stable catalyst. Mesoporous alumina has been widely used as the ideal carrier based on soft-template synthesis method using nonionic diblock or triblock poly(ethyleneoxide) surfactants such as P123, particularly, Bhaumik et al. [23] developed high surface area of mesoporous alumina reaching ca. 500 m2/g, which provided great chance for the synthesis of excellent noble metal-supported catalyst. On the other hand, the surface property of support has been certified to exert the notable influence on the status of dispersed metal species. Especially, modulation of support property would render the obvious variation of metal’s catalytic property. Metal-doping strategy gives a promising version for adjusting the condition of support including surface acidic/basic and redox properties, while the electronic structure and valence of catalytic active atoms appeared on the support would be accordingly modulated [24–29]. Generally, some interesting correlationships between catalytic active sites and those doped metal atoms can be built up during the synthesized procedure. Rationally, the enhanced catalytic activity will be received based on the proper modification. More importantly, metal-doping tends to be more influential for the isolated catalytic active atoms namely single site than the aggregated particles because the stability of isolated active atoms is more dependent on the metal-support interaction. Therefore, the single site of active metal-bearing catalyst could be further optimized via adjusting the property of carrier, which remains to be conducted with more efforts. In addition, even if the noble metal-based catalyst have reveal remarkable catalytic reductive activity in many reactions, it is difficult for concurrently acquiring the excellent catalytic oxidative and reductive property in light of only noble metal catalyst. To delight, the introduction of heteroatom metal on the carrier can trigger the multiple catalytic activities toward different aspects including hydrogenated and oxidized reaction, namely dual catalyst, because of the common presence of noble and non-noble metal, which provides the more chance for developing multifunctional catalyst. Herein, we report a Ni-Pd co-modified nanoporous alumina dual catalyst in light of hydrogenated and oxidized reactions with the ultralow Pd loading and adjustable concentration of Ni, which was synthesized by the solvent-induced evaporation interfacial self-assembly process(EISA). It can be found that the doping of nickel efficiently promotes the dispersion of active Pd atoms on the nanoporous alumina based on the hydrogen titrimetric study, thereby contributing to the higher dispersity of Pd active atoms toward quasi single site state. In addition, the import of nickel atoms in alumina resulted in the discriminative chemical status of Pd due to the different chemical environment on the carrier. We systematically characterized the physicochemical properties of the resulted catalysts by virtue of various efficacious techniques. The hydrogenation of phenylacetylene acted as the model reaction to evaluate the catalytic performance of various comparative catalysts. The effect of the doping nickel in the support on the catalytic properties was corroborated by the systematical catalytic studies. Additionally, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with molecular oxygen using the dual Pd-Ni based alumina was further assessed to identify its catalytic oxidization activity including the Pd and Ni species together."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Triblock copolymer Pluronic®123 (PEO-PPO-PEO, M = 5800) and aluminum isopropoxide(C9H21AlO3, AR) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate(Ni(NO3)3 ⋅ 6H2O, AR), phenylacetylene, toluene and benzyl alcohol were purchased from Aladdin. Palladium chloride(PdCl2, Pd>67 wt%) was purchased from Sinopharm Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) and nitric acid (69 wt%) were supplied by Merk Pte. Ltd. All the reagents were used without any purification."
3,Preparation of nickel-promoting Pd supported nanoporous alumina,"2.2 Preparation of nickel-promoting Pd supported nanoporous alumina The typical synthetic procedure is depicted as follows: firstly, 2.2 g of P123 was dissolved in 40 ml of ethanol, and followed by adding 3.2 ml nitric acid(69 wt%). After stirring for 30 min, 4.08 g of aluminum isopropoxide was poured into above-mixed solutions with a continuous stirring for 4 h, and then the desirable amount of PdCl2 solution(8.4 mg/ml) and controlled amount of Ni(NO3)2 ⋅ 6H2O were added and for another 24 h stirring. Subsequently, the resulting mixed solutions were placed into an oven maintained at 60 °C for 48 h for a solvent evaporation-induced interfacial self-assembly process. Finally, the obtained samples were grinded and calcined at 400 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 1 °C. The resulted catalysts were designated as 0.2PdxNi-NA. Subsequently, the obtained catalysts were further reduced at 5% H 2 atmosphere at 300 °C for 1 h, and the final catalysts were designated as 0.2PdxNi-NA(R). The comparative samples with the tuned loading of Pd supported mesoporous alumina were prepared by adjusting the addition of initial Pd precursor based on the same procedure. The resulted samples were designated as xPd-NA(R)(x = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5)."
4,CaTalyst characterizations,"2.3 CaTalyst characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer, at a scan rate of 2º/min. It was operated at 40 kV with a potential current of 30 mA. Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was used to examine the nature of the adsorbed species on the catalysts. The system consisted of an FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50) equipped with a DRIFTS cell and a praying mantis mirror assembly which had been modified to allow catalyst pretreatment. Infrared spectra of adsorbed species were collected at atmospheric pressure and 298 K at a resolution of 4 cm − 1 . Each spectrum after adsorption was referenced to that of the freshly pretreated sample just prior to the introduction of the adsorbate. The textural properties of the samples were collected by measuring the physical adsorption of nitrogen at a liquid-nitrogen temperature of 77 K using an automatic volumetric sorption analyzer (NOVA3200e, Quantachrome). The specific surface areas and distribution of pore size were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG Escalab MKII spectrometer, using a mono Al K α X-ray source (h ν = 1486 . 71 eV , 5 mA, 15 kV), and the calibration was conducted using the reference C1s peak at 284.6 eV. ICP-Metal content in the catalyst was determined by iCAP 6000 series inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The catalysts were digested in aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 = 3:1) at 353 K for 4 h and then diluted with deionized water to a certain volume before the analysis. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and H 2 - O 2 titration was conducted on a ChemBET Pulsar TPR/TPD (Quantachrome). For TPR analysis, 50 mg of each catalyst was tested in a fixed-bed reactor from room temperature to 800 °C with 10% H 2 /Ar atmosphere flow and a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Before the analysis, the samples were purified by flowing 30 ml/min argon at 300 °C for 1 h, followed with cooling to room temperature. H 2 - O 2 titration analyses were conducted based on the pretreatment of air at 100 °C and titration of 20% H 2 ∕ N 2 . The dispersity of Pd species on mesoporous alumina was calculated based on Clapyron Equation: PV = nRT. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEM 2100F (JEOL, Japan) microscope operated at 200 kV."
5,Catalysis assessment,"2.4 Catalysis assessment Hydrogenation of phenylacetylene The substrate (20.6 μ L for phenylacetylene), the controlled dosage of catalyst(Pd/ substrate = 1:500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, molar ratio) and methanol(1 mL) were poured into an autoclave. The reactor was purged with pure H 2 to 10 bars and performed at room temperature for 30 min. Reaction products were filtered with a PTFE syringe filter (pore diameter: 0. 2 μ m ) and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 GC equipped with FID detector with two capillary columns). Oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde The catalytic oxidative performance of 0.2PdxNi-NA was evaluated by the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with oxygen bubble in toluene. In a typical run, benzyl alcohol (2 mmol), toluene (10 mL), and catalyst (0.05 g) were successively added in a reaction tube with 20 mL/min of oxygen flow rate and stirred at 100 °C for 4 h under fierce stirring. For accurate analysis of the product, after reacting, ethanol (10 mL) was added to dilute the reaction system. The liquid phase was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890) using the external standard for calculation. Conversion (benzyl alcohol) = mmol (benzyl alcohol) converted/mmol (initial benzyl alcohol) × 100%, selectivity of benzaldehyde = mmol (benzaldehyde)/mmol (benzyl alcohol converted) × 100%."
6,Results and discussion,"The synthetic process of the typical sample follows the Solvent Evaporation-induced Interfacial Self-assembly(EISA) method and is illustrated in detail in Scheme 1. Initially, the triblock copolymer P123 spontaneously assembles into micelle template in the ethanol solution. Aluminum isopropoxide added would hydrolyze in the acid condition, then absorb and deposit on the micelle surface of P123 during the solvent evaporation process. Meanwhile, metal precursors dissolved in the gels of aluminum isopropoxide would be incorporated into the skeleton of alumina. The high-temperature thermal process would be capable of causing the decomposition and removal of the organic micelle, and the larger metal atoms like Pd would immigrate out from the skeleton and emerge on the pore surface during the annealing process. The dispersity of Pd species on the mesoporous alumina surface was preciously identified by means of the H 2 pulse titration technique through the consumption of H 2 based on the absorption and reduction of H 2 on Pd atoms. Before the measurement, the samples were primarily pretreated with air to totally oxidize the surface Pd atoms at the temperature of 100 °C. Subsequently, the samples were titrated with 20%(volume ratio) H 2 ∕ N 2 . As observed, an obvious consumption of H 2 was detected for the involved tested sample, indicating the robust absorption and interaction of H 2 (Fig. 1). However, it is noteworthy that the different consumption volume of H 2 for various comparative samples was observed, indicating the discriminative surface exposed degree of Pd atoms on mesoporous alumina(Fig. 1). The proportion of the consumed hydrogen and total Pd atoms H 2 /Pd was calculated based on the Clapyron Equation(PV=nRT) [30,31]. The series samples including 0.2Pd1Ni-NA(R), 0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R), 0.2Pd3Ni-NA(R), 0.2Pd4Ni-NA(R), and 0.2Pd-NA(R) correspond to their respective H 2 /Pd proportions of 48.13%, 48.3%, 48.15%, 42.1%, and 36.1%. The calculated dispersity based on the proportion of the exposed Pd atoms and total Pd loading atoms confirms the enhanced exposure of Pd species in the nickel-containing Pd-Al2O3 as compared to the only Pd-bearing mesoporous alumina. This result may be in junction with the fact that the presence of the larger Ni atoms compared to aluminum atom on the surface of alumina aggrandizes the migratory impediment of Pd atoms under the thermal-derived force, thereby reducing the aggregation of Pd atoms [32,33]. However, it can be found that with an unremitting increment of nickel species in the sample, the dispersity of Pd on the mesoporous surface shows a feeble variation, but also clearly higher than that of Pd-bearing nanoporous alumina in the absence of nickel. In addition, to confirm the function of nickel-doping for the Pd supported mesoporous alumina, we checked the H 2 pulse titration of 0.5%Pd2Ni-NA(R)(Fig. 1S), the result reconfirms the aforementioned dispersity-improved phenomenon, which is consistent with that of 0.2 wt% of Pd supported nanoporous alumina. However, note that nickel-doping 1 wt% Pd supported nanoporous alumina show no obvious improvement of Pd dispersion(Fig. 1S), indicating the doping of nickel may fail to promote the further dispersion of Pd at a relatively high loading of Pd. Taken together, we tentatively concluded that the introduction of Ni atoms in the alumina can efficiently promote the dispersion of Pd species to some extent, but the consecutive introduction of Ni or doping for the high loading catalyst may fail to endow the remarkable enhanced efficiency for another catalytic active species. Fig. 2 shows the wide-angle XRD patterns of various samples, just as observed, with the increment of Pd loading in mesoporous alumina, an obviously enhanced crystalline diffraction peak located at ca. 34°emerges and is definitely indexed to Pd(111) crystal facet diffraction(Fig. 2a) [34], indicating the formation of crystalline Pd particles in matrix at relatively high loading of Pd. Compared to the highest loading(1.5%) of Pd-NA(R), the lowest loading one(0.2Pd-NA(R)) hardly shows any crystalline diffraction of Pd species, verifying the scarce aggregation and high dispersion of Pd. While, based on the identical loading of Pd in mesoporous alumina, the varying amount of nickel modified 0.2PdxNi-NA(R) show the similar wide-angle diffraction phenomenon(Fig. 2b), and no crystalline NiO diffraction presents on the curves yet, indicating the highly-dispersed state of the doping Ni atoms in alumina. In addition, the resultant samples reduced with hydrogen display the similar diffraction of amorphous alumina in the absence of any Pd or Ni crystalline diffraction peaks(Fig. 2c), indicating the reduced process did not ensuingly lure the aggregation of the dispersed Pd or nickel species. Fig. 3a, 3b display the textural characteristic of various samples by the measurement of N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, and corresponding pore size distribution is shown in Fig. 3c, 3d. Typically, the IV type isotherms and H1 hysteresis loop are clearly observed in each curve and strongly demonstrate the mesostructure of materials [35]. Notably, the varied loadings of Pd-bearing mesoporous alumina show the evolutive characteristic isotherm owing to the adjusting Pd loading’s introduction during the synthesis(Fig. 2S). At the same time, we also noticed the decrement of surface area and the enlargement of the pore size of mesoporous alumina, which remarkably assigned to the presence of increasing Pd species. However, even with the modification of varying nickel loading, the structure of the material is still well retained, implying the doping of heteroatom nickel in the mesoporous matrix hardly damages the pristine mesoporous structure during the synthetic process. Furthermore, mesoporous structure of the resultant series 0.2PdxNi-NA(R) samples were confirmed by means of the low-angle XRD results(Fig. 3S) because of the presence of mesophase 100 diffraction peak. Meanwhile, the surface area and pore size of different nickel-containing samples show a similar parameter result( ∼ 220 cm2/g, and ∼ 7 nm), indicating a feeble influence of imported nickel on the structural property. On the other hand, the samples reduced by hydrogen also exhibit the similar mesostructure with obvious IV type isotherms and H1 hysteresis loop, ulteriorly verifying the reduction process’ negligible effect on the entire textural properties of alumina (See Table 1). The morphology and microscale structure of mesoporous alumina materials were directly identified by TEM technique, and the representative TEM images are further presented in Fig. 4. Just as observed, the porous structure of mesoporous alumina is preliminarily discerned with ∼ 7 nm pore size(Fig. 4a and d), coinciding with the N 2 adsorption/desorption results and low-angle XRD results(Fig. 3S). Meanwhile, the amorphous state of mesoporous alumina was also confirmed from the high-resolution TEM image(Fig. 4b), which is in agreement with the high-angle XRD results. On the other hand, the morphology and mesoporous structure of 0.2Pd-Al2O3 presented in Fig. 4a is consistent with nickel modified Pd-NA(Fig. 4d, e), indicating the addition of nickel shows the feeble influence on the structure of the material, which is coincided with the N 2 adsorption/desorption results. In the case of various 0.2%Pd loading of series samples, the Pd and NiO particles both fail to be definitely identified based on the TEM characterization results, implying their small enough size characteristic and high dispersity of Pd and Ni species, normally named as the quasi single site state, thereby possibly affording more interesting catalytic property. In contrast, the high loading of only Pd-bearing mesoporous alumina including 0.5Pd-NA(R), 1Pd-NA(R), 1.5Pd-NA(R) were further examined with the high-resolution TEM(Fig. 4S), and certain numbers of Pd nanoparticles can be clearly found in the corresponding TEM images, signifying the certain degree aggregation of Pd species after calcination of pristine samples owing to the more frequent migration of dense Pd atoms under high temperature. This result is in good agreement with the aforementioned wide-angle XRD analysis. For confirming the presence and distribution of Pd on the mesoporous alumina in ultralow concentration condition, the high-resolution elemental mapping technique was utilized to ulteriorly examine the sample(Fig. 4c), the corresponding elemental distribution outcomes extracted from the elemental mapping affirm the main constituent elements including Al, O, Pd for the 0.2Pd-NA. In the case of Pd-Ni co-modified mesoporous alumina, the Al, O, Pd, Ni appear as the main constituent elements and afford the uniform and high dispersion of Pd and nickel on the material(Fig. 4f), which is in favor of the quasi single site state of Pd in alumina. Based on the previous report [2], we acknowledged that the adsorption behavior of carbon monoxide can objectively shed light on the atomic state of supported noble metal on the carrier including their dispersion and environment. Especially, the CO stretches derived from the different bonding types on the isolative metal atoms and aggregated metal clusters to form the linear and bridge linkages(C ≡ O ⋯ Pd, Pd ⋯ C ≡ O ⋯ Pd) can clearly distinguish the specific exposed metal sites on the surface of the carrier(Fig. 5f). For instance, as universally appreciated, the emerging CO stretches in IR spectra at 2080–2100 cm−1 is ascribed to CO linearly-adsorbed on the isolative Pd atom. While the emerging CO stretches at ca. 2060 cm−1, ca. 1860 cm−1 and ca. 1950 cm−1 are ascribed to the linearly-bonded CO on single Pd sites of aggregated Pd species, bridge-bonded CO on the neighboring Pd atoms and CO adsorbed on the interface between Pd clusters and the support, respectively. To ascertain these detail information, the CO adsorption/desorption behavior of various Pd-bearing Al2O3 (Fig. 5(a-f)) were measured by virtue of DRIFTS techniques to identify the dispersion and oxidation state of Pd species on the alumina based on the profile of CO IR spectra. As observed, the low-concentrated Pd-bearing sample gives the dominant linear absorbed state on the isolated Pd atoms not excluding the existence of bridged CO on the cluster-like Pd species on the surface of alumina. As comparison, Ni-bearing sample (0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R)) shows the remarkable difference especially for the isolated Pd atoms proportion compared with the neighboring state of Pd atoms, which indicating the increasing of single site of Pd in the sample thanks to the introduction of Ni around the Pd species. This result should be attributed to the existed migration barrier of Pd after introducing Ni species, thereby prohibiting the migration and aggregation of Pd. To identify the evolution of Pd state on the nanoporous alumina, the enhanced concentrated Pd-bearing samples including 0.5Pd-, 1Pd-, and 1.5Pd-ones were ulteriorly checked by DRIFT technique. An obvious evolution in light of the aggregated Pd species corresponding to bridged-absorption of CO at 1900 cm−1 was observed from the low intensity and proportion to a bigger value, which indicates the occurrence of more Pd atom aggregation on the nanoporous alumina in the high Pd concentration condition. Additionally, the single site of Pd in the sample still can be found to some extent even with the high density of Pd in the sample, but the proportion of single site of Pd seems low compared to the aggregated Pd species, which indicating the co-existence of atomic level and aggregated Pd species on the mesoporous alumina. Taken together, this result ulteriorly reflects the fact that the introduced Ni promotes the transformation of Pd species toward the isolated atom state namely quasi single atom compared to that without Ni or higher concentration of Pd loading one. H 2 -TPR techniques were employed to identify the reductive properties of surface metal species. The detail H 2 -TPR curves of these involved samples are presented in Fig. 6. As observed, the only Pd-containing catalysts show the variable trend with the increasing loading of Pd in the mesoporous alumina. Thereinto, the catalysts of 0.2Pd-NA and 0.5Pd-NA show a reduction peak at 503 °C ascribed to the reduction from Pd(II) to Pd(0) [32,36]. This is resulted from the reduction of surface isolated Pd atoms incorporated into the alumina. In the case of 1Pd-NA, two obvious reduction peaks located at ca. 503 °C and ca. 405 °C are identified expressly, which should be assigned to the surface isolated Pd atoms and PdO clusters on the pore wall respectively [31]. The catalyst 1.5Pd-NA with the highest loading of Pd exhibits the dominant one reduction peak at 405 °C, which corresponds to the large-sized PdO clusters on the mesoporous alumina surface. Even a small reductive peak at ca. 500 °C can be found and correspond to the isolated Pd atoms, their proportion remains marginal compared to the aggregated Pd species, which is in good accordance with aforementioned IR analysis. This phenomenon is closely associated with the fact that high loading of Pd easier triggered the aggregation of Pd atoms thereby causing the formation of large sized PdO clusters. On the other hand, the Ni-Pd co-modified alumina 0.2Pd1Ni-NA presents a folded reduction profiles containing the reduction of Pd and Ni oxidation state species. The folded profile with the main peak at 563 °C and a shoulder at 481 °C attributed to the reduction of surface Ni species and Pd species [37–39], respectively. Thus, the prolonged reduced peaks after 800 °C should be assigned to Ni atoms embedded in the framework of alumina and then migrated out from the framework at a higher temperature, thereby illustrating the moderate reduced peak intensity of Ni at 563 °C. More importantly, it is well noticed that the reduction peak corresponding to Pd shows a shift towards lower temperature compared to that of 0.2Pd-NA, which is easily associated with the presence of Ni atoms inducing the variation of Pd state. This might be attributed to the changing of Pd valence especially emerged as the quasi single site state and surrounded by the introduced Ni atom, which could be further approved by following XPS analysis result. The precise identification of elemental chemical state was ascertained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fig. 7 displays the high-resolution XPS spectra on the Pd3d core-level of only Pd-bearing Al2O3 and Ni-Pd co-supported Al2O3. Based on the raw spectra of Pd3d core level, we ulteriorly conducted the peaks fitting of XPS spectra curves(Fig. 7a, b, c, d). Just as observed, the unreduced 0.2Pd-NA and 0.2Pd2Ni-NA show the single-phase chemical valence of Pd corresponding to the oxidation state of Pd(II) in mesoporous alumina(Fig. 7a, c) [39–41]. However, what we obviously noticed is that the binding energy assigned to the Pd3d 5 ∕ 2 in the samples of Ni-bearing and Ni-free is discriminative. This result is closely associated with the different chemical states of Pd in the samples due to the doping of Ni causing the changing chemical environment of Pd, which manifests the strong influence of Ni around the active Pd species. Whereas, the reduced 0.2Pd-NA(R) and 0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R) obviously afford the mixed phases electronic states including oxidation state and the metallic state of Pd(Fig. 7b, d). Especially, the low valence of Pd species was observed for the reduced 0.2Pd-NA(R) and 0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R) from the hydrogen reduction process in comparison with unreduced samples, certifying the actual reduction process from the oxidation state of Pd(II) to metallic Pd. However, note that, compared with the 0.2Pd-NA(R), the nickel-doping sample exhibits the specific difference between the electronic states of Pd, the obvious shift towards low binding energy is observed for the sample 0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R), indicating the lower coordination numbers of Pd in mesoporous alumina [31,40]. Meanwhile, it can be found that the reduced state of Pd from the 0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R) affords the lower binding energy compared to that of 0.2Pd-NA(R), indicating the obvious difference of Pd chemical state in the resulted catalysts. In addition, the chemical state of element Ni was further identified based on the high-resolution XPS spectra, and the resulted information is presented in Fig. 5S. By comparison, it was found the binding energy of Ni2p 3 ∕ 2 was not obviously changed between the Pd-free and Pd-containing mesoporous alumina likely owing to the slight influence of ultra-low Pd loading in the samples. While the certain shift towards the lower value regarding the 0.2Pd2Ni-NA(R) can be observed compared to the 0.2Pd2Ni-NA, indicating the feeble influence of reduction process on the Ni chemical state. However, the binding energy assigned to element Ni is still consisted of the oxidation state of Ni(II), manifesting the given reduction temperature hardly reduced the Ni species. Catalytic analysis for hydrogenation of phenylacetylene To the best of our knowledge, Pd-based ingredients have been ascertained as the superior hydrogenated catalyst [42,43]. Herein, the selective semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene was checked for evaluating the catalytic performance of various controlled samples (Scheme 2). Based on the mild reaction condition(room temperature), we explored the effect of catalyst dosage on the reaction results using different catalysts(Fig. 8). The detailed catalytic data is further displayed in Table 2S. The Pd/substrate proportion is controlled from 1:500 to 1:8000 under the same reaction condition. With the preview of all the catalytic results, it can be obviously observed that the varied proportions of Pd/substrate lead to the different catalytic selectivity of phenylacetylene hydrogenation. The highly selective production of styrene can be obtained at a low proportion of Pd/substrate. With the gradual increasing proportion of Pd/substrate, the drastically increasing phenylethane was demonstrated, which is consistent with that of the other Pd-containing samples. The large dosage of catalyst in the reaction systems contributes to the complete production of phenylethane, while the low dosage of the catalyst is beneficial to the generation of styrene [44,45]. This phenomenon is associated with the fact that the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene is a successive reaction process [45,46], and the sufficient dosage of catalyst easily renders the fast reaction process from phenylacetylene to styrene. Once completely transformed, the restant styrene is very easily transformed to phenylethane with the assistance of active Pd catalyst. Therefore, under the same reaction time, a large dosage of Pd-based catalyst would directly promote the production of phenylethane. On the other hand, compared to the only Pd-bearing nanoporous alumina, what we noted is that the introduced nickel gives rise to the varying catalytic activity of different samples based on the identical catalyst dosage in the reaction. The phenomenon is obviously associated with the doping of nickel in the samples. As observed, the enhanced conversion of phenylacetylene was obtained with the low dosage of catalyst in the presence of Ni modified Pd-NA. Accordingly, the present TOF value of 0.2Pd1Ni-, 0.2Pd2Ni-, 0.2Pd3Ni-NA(R) is higher than that of the 0.2Pd-NA(R). This result is associated with the case that the increasing dispersion of Pd because of the presence of Ni. In contrast, the sample of 0.2Pd4Ni-NA(R) gives a relatively poor catalytic activity compared to other counterparts, which is attributed to the relatively low dispersion of Pd owing to the excessive introduction of Ni. We checked the catalytic results of the controlled Pd loading of xPd-NA catalysts, and those corresponding reaction data is presented in Table 1S. As observed, a remarkable evolutive catalytic activity result was presented with the gradually increasing Pd loading in the catalyst at the same Pd/substrate proportion during this reaction. In comparison with the TOF (h−1) value of series xPd-NA, we identified that the higher loading of Pd in the alumina causes the descent of catalytic efficiency of active Pd species, which should be resulted from the aggregation of active Pd atoms and concealing of active sites in the aggregated Pd clusters. The TOF values calculated from the different usage dosages of catalysts are displayed in Fig. 9. It can be found that the TOF value presents a visibly variable trend decreasing from the 6944 h−1 to 4936 h − 1 with the increment of Pd loading from 0.2% to 1.5% Pd loading(Fig. 9a), which implies the drop of catalytic efficiency owing to the aggregation and concealing of Pd active atoms. On the other hand, the Ni modified 0.2Pd-NA exhibit the differential TOF values in the phenylacetylene hydrogenation thanks to the introduction of Ni. As clearly observed, compared to the only Pd-containing mesoporous alumina, the gradual introduction of Ni from 1Ni, 2Ni, 3Ni obviously contributes to the higher conversion and TOF value(8000 h−1), while the higher introduced amount of 4Ni results in the decreasing of phenylacetylene conversion at a low catalyst dosage. In junction with the H 2 titration results, we realized that the enhancement of Pd dispersity from the Ni introduction accounts for the higher TOF values of reaction. Possible hydrogenated reaction process mechanism The reaction process of phenylacetylene hydrogenation on the Pd-Ni co-supported alumina is proposed tentatively (Scheme 3). Initially, the H 2 was absorbed on the active Pd atoms and dissociated into two hydrogen atoms [47]. Simultaneously, the reactant molecule absorbed on the Pd atoms via the interaction between d type unoccupied orbital of Pd and π bond of triple bonds was easily activated and accompanied with breakage of π bond. The dissociated H atoms around the active sites would attack the activated phenylacetylene molecule and connect the broken π bond. Accordingly, the new C-H bonds would be formed after the interaction and simultaneously accompanied with formation of styrene. At one time, the formed styrene would desorb from the Pd atoms surface partially, and a portion of styrene on the Pd atom surface may be ulteriorly activated and interacted with the dissociated H atoms. Consequently, the further hydrogenated product of phenylethane was formed finally. While, the presence of Ni atoms on the alumina may promote the hydrogen spillover process and cause the dissociated H atoms to disperse to the inactive Ni atoms, thereby retarding the further hydrogenation of styrene on the Pd atoms. The superiority of introduced Ni for the regulation of catalytic selectivity is unobvious with high catalyst dosage, which is attributed to that the overquick catalytic reaction rate covers up the existed hydrogen spillover phenomenon. While, using the low catalyst dosage, the introduction of Ni shows the visible regulation of catalytic selectivity for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. Catalytic analysis for oxidation of benzyl alcohol The catalytic performance of 0.2PdxNi-NA in oxidized aspect was further investigated based on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using the molecular oxygen (Scheme 4), and their corresponding catalytic parameters were displayed in Table 2. As shown, the Pd-bearing catalyst with the adjusted concentration of Pd and those in the presence/absence of metal nickel were checked together under the identical reaction condition. It is noticed that the reduced catalysts show the obviously-promotive catalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. More interestingly, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity of benzaldehyde were drastically increased in the presence of active Pd and Ni together in the reaction process as compared to only Pd-bearing or only Ni-bearing one, which indicates the joint-promotive effect on the catalytic reaction. This promotive result more relies on the participation of active metal Ni(II) especially in the aspect of selectivity of benzaldehyde, extracted from the observed catalytic results. This is because transition metal Ni affords the intrinsic catalytic oxidation capacity [48,49]. Additionally, compared with the unreduced Pd-Ni-bearing catalyst, their counterparts that the reduced one gives rise to increment in catalytic conversion and selectivity to some extent, which should be associated with the deoxygenation of PdO interacted with the alumina in proportion, judging from the characterization such as XPS result. Taken together, the Pd-Ni co-modified alumina appeared as the efficient dual catalyst affording high catalytic activity towards hydrogenated and oxidized reaction. "
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we successfully developed the dual catalyst affording high catalytic activity towards hydrogenated and oxidized reaction based on nickel-bearing nanoporous alumina supported ultralow Pd loading. The introduction of nickel exerts a certain impact on the Pd species on the surface of mesoporous alumina. The enhanced dispersity of Pd species toward the more appearance of isolated Pd atoms namely quasi single atoms status thanks to that the doped nickel in the alumina induced the bigger migration barrier was affirmed based on the H 2 pulse titration technique and DRIFT study. Besides, the electron state of Pd has been affected in the presence of nickel, which might be resulted from the existed strong interaction with Ni species. As a result, the Ni-Pd supported alumina show the almostly-complete conversion and the varying catalytic selectivity in the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene and oxidation of benzyl alcohol. More interestingly, the catalytic activity was enhanced to some extent after the reduction of catalyst attributed to the deoxygenation of PdO species. This synthetic tactic provides the insight for the design of dual catalyst in light of hydrogenated and oxidized reactions."
