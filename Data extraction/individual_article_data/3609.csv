0,Introduction,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a deleterious and ferocious corrosive gas that has been largely released especially in the field of acid gas reservoir exploitation, and it is estimated that there are approximate 4.6 × 109 tons of H2S altogether under the black sea [1]. Meanwhile, H2S is harmful to humans in even low concentration and can lead to death when the concentration is over 700 ppm in the air [2]. Fortunately, H2S as the precursor of hydrogen energy and high-value-added sulfides has received worldwide attention from the perspective of renewable resource utilization. Various works have successfully reported H2 production from H2S by photocatalysis technology as yet [3–5]. In 1984, anatase TiO2 as the typical non-toxic photocatalyst with high stability and low cost was first applied for the photo-splitting of H2S [6]. Since Yang et al. synthesized the single phase anatase TiO2 exposed with high proportion of {0 0 1} facets in 2008, extensive researches have reported that TiO2 with dominated {0 0 1} can be facilely synthesized through adding morphology control agents [7–10]. Importantly, both theoretical and experimental studies found that {0 0 1} facets were relatively active under the equilibrium state [11–13]. It was revealed that surface free energy of anatase TiO2 increased in the order of {1 0 1} (0.44 J m−2) < {1 0 0} (0.53 J m−2) < {0 0 1} (0.90 J m−2) [14]. What is more, the photo-degradation activity for glyphosate of anatase TiO2 with different exposed facets was ranked in the order of {0 0 1} > {1 0 1} > {1 0 0} [15]. Moreover, researchers also found the photocatalytic activities for NH3 oxidation was ordered by {0 0 1} > {1 0 1} > {0 1 0} [16]. In addition, our previous work pointed out that the {0 0 1} facet of anatase TiO2 exhibited higher photoactivity than other facets for H2 evolution from water splitting [17]. However, the pursuit of high photocatalytic activity still remains a challenging task. Although the {0 0 1} facet of anatase TiO2 possesses more proportion of under-coordinated 5-fold Ti5c and 2-fold O2c atoms compared with other low-index facets that may induce higher reactivity due to the unsaturated bonds, the low solar-light absorption and intrinsic high recombination of photo-generated carriers still restrict its photocatalytic activities [18]. To overcome these drawbacks, a series of surface engineering strategies have been applied, including forming of heterojunction, depositing noble metals and coupling with zero-dimensional quantum dots [19–22]. Among them, the self-doping oxygen vacancy has currently become a hot spot [23–25]. For instance, the photocatalytic activity of oxygen vacancies modified anatase TiO2 {0 0 1} was greatly enhanced for the photo-reduction of CO2 [26]. Our previous theoretical study also showed that the surface oxygen vacancies can promote the electron transfer and facilitate the decomposition of H2S on rutile TiO2 [27]. Inspired by these, the conversion of harmful H2S into clear energy H2 is of great importance in view of the growing global energy and environmental crisis. However, there is little research about the oxygen vacancies doped anatase TiO2 {0 0 1} in the application of photo-splitting of H2S and the photocatalytic mechanism of H2 production from H2S deserves in-depth study. This work will expound the effects of oxygen vacancies on enhancing the photocatalytic performance by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as well as characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test, UV-Vis reflectance spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements. The present study can offer new insights for H2 production from H2S on metal oxides in the field of photocatalysis."
1,Calculation and experimental sections,
2,Calculation,"2.1 Calculation This calculation was performed by the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) [28,29]. Blöchl’s projector-augmented wave (PAW) functional was adopted to describe the electron-ion interactions for Ti, O, S and H atoms. The cut-off energy value was 400 eV for calculations [30]. Geometric optimizations were accomplished when the energy convergence below 10−5 eV per cell. The lattice parameters for bulk anatase TiO2 were a = b = 3.78 Å and c = 9.49 Å. Surface energy convergence of supercells was tested in Fig. S1 and it began to converge at the 2 × 2 supercell, indicating the 2 × 2 slab was sufficient to provide reliable surface properties and used in the study. A vacuum space of 20 Å was applied to wipe out the interaction of periodically repeated slabs and Brillouin-zone with 2 × 2 × 1 k-points were used in calculations. 4.2 eV of Hubbard U value has been introduced to the system to correct the strong interaction of Ti 3d electrons orbital, which has been widely applied in other works [31,32]. Two bottom layers of the slab were frozen and the upper layers were relaxed during the geometry optimization to produce good convergence of {0 0 1} surface, which has been used in previous studies [33,34]. The oxygen vacancies formation energy (E f) was obtained by the following formula: (1) E f = E d e f e c t e d s u r f a c e + 1 / 2 E ( O 2 ) - E s u r f a c e where the E defected surface, E surface and the E(O2) was the energy of anatase TiO2 {0 0 1} doped with oxygen vacancies, the energy of perfect anatase TiO2 {0 0 1} surface and the total energy of O2, respectively. The adsorption behaviors between TiO2 {0 0 1} surface and H2S, HS-H, H-S-H, H2-S were investigated by the adsorption energy (E ad), which was defined as the equation: (2) E a d = E a d s o r b a t e / s u r f a c e - E a d s o r b a t e - E s u r f a c e where E adsorbate/surface represented the energy of anatase {0 0 1} surface with adsorbed molecule, E adsorbate was the energy of isolated adsorbate in the vacuum space and E surface was the perfect anatase {0 0 1} surface energy. The work function (Φ) was calculated by the following equation [35], in which E vac was the electrostatic potential of the vacuum level and E F was the Fermi energy. (3) Φ = E v a c - E F The difference charge densities (Δρ) between the fragmental structure and anatase surface were calculated by the following equation: (4) Δ ρ = ρ ( a d s o r b a t e / s u r f a c e ) - ρ ( s u r f a c e ) - ρ ( a d s o r b a t e ) where ρ (adsorbate/surface), ρ (surface) and ρ (adsorbate) were the charge densities of adsorbed system, the perfect anatase {0 0 1} surface and the adsorbate fragmental structure, respectively."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis TiO2 {0 0 1} (TO) was synthesized by the conventional hydrothermal method [36,37]. 3.75 mL of Tetra-n-butyl Titanate was poured into a totally dried 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Meanwhile, 0.6 mL HF was felicitously dropped into the above autoclave. Then the autoclave was put into an electric oven held at 200 °C for 24 h. After autoclave cooling to normal temperature, 0.1 M NaOH was applied to neutralize the F−. Then the white deposits were gathered by vacuum filtration with ultrapure water and alcohol washing. Finally, the deposits were dried overnight at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. TiO2 {0 0 1} with oxygen vacancies (TOVx) was synthesized by a facile reduction method via NaBH4 [38]. 200 mg prepared TO powders were mixed with 120 mg NaBH4 in an agate mortar and fully ground. Then the mixed powders were calcined in Ar at 300 °C for 0.5 h, keeping the heating rate at 10 °C·min−1. Finally, the calcined powders were washed by ultrapure water and alcohol until pH 7. The as-prepared TOVx were represented as TOV1, TOV2, TOV3, TOV4 (with a NaBH4 quantity of 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystal structures of prepared samples were verified by PANalytical X'pert powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα. The microstructure of TO and TOVx was perceived by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). UV–vis spectrometer was obtained by using Barium sulfate as the background by Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. The chemical states of Ti and O elements were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Photocurrents were conducted by using the CHI660E electrochemical work station (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai, China). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was implemented by the BrukerE 500 spectrometer operating at room temperature."
5,Photocatalytic H2S into H2,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2S into H2 The photocatalytic activity of H2S into H2 was performed in photoreaction equipment [39,40]. 2.5 mg photocatalysts were fully dispersed in 50 mL sacrificial agents containing Na2S·9H2O and Na2SO3 by a sonication process for 20 min. Next, the solution was ventilated by Ar gas for 20 min to exhaust air, and 3 M H2S was continuously bubbling in the reactor for 3 h to gather adequate reactant. After that, the reactor was irradiated under the 300 W Xe lamp with full spectrum at least for 5 h. Finally, the amount of hydrogen production was gauged by the Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph (GC)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Electronic structures and thermodynamic properties of H2S on the surface,"3.1 Electronic structures and thermodynamic properties of H2S on the surface Oxygen vacancy formation energies (E f) are investigated in order to clarify the most favorable oxygen vacancy site. Fig. 1 a shows four different oxygen vacancy sites on the anatase {0 0 1} surface. As displayed in Table 1 , E f reveals that the bridged oxygen vacancy site 1 is the most thermodynamically stable. Upon the formation of surface oxygen vacancy, the difference charge density maps show that the adjacent Ti atoms move away and the distance between TiTi changes from 3.79 Å to 4.42 Å (Fig. 1b and c). Simultaneously, excess charges at site 1 flow to the two neighbors Ti atoms that may induce the formation of Ti3+ from Ti4+ states [41]. Fig. 2 a displays the band structure and part density of states (PDOS) of TiO2 {0 0 1} perfect surface and defected surface. The calculated band gap (E g) for the perfect surface is 2.33 eV, which is similar with other theoretical observations [42]. While the E g for defected surface narrows to 2.04 eV due to the shifting down of conduction bands, which may benefit the light absorption. As is shown from the PDOS of perfect surface, the top of valence bands is mainly combined by O 2p orbital. Correspondingly, the bottom of conduction bands is largely contributed by Ti 3d orbital. As a result, the electron transfer may be from the O 2p to Ti 3d orbital [43]. Notably, it is observed from the band structure that an intermediate energy level composed by Ti 3d orbitals appears at the forbidden region on the defected surface, which may be due to the excess charges on the Ti atoms donated by the adjacent oxygen vacancy as observed by difference charge density maps in Fig. 1. As a result, the electrons can transit more easily from the valence bands to conduction bands via the defect energy level, and further promote the separation of photo-induced carriers. To study the thermodynamic properties of H2S decomposition, the molecular adsorption behaviors of H2S and its fragments HS-H, H-S-H and H2-S are investigated in Fig. 2b. The adsorbed H2S molecule has a traditional bond length of 1.35 Å with a bond angle of 91.2°, which is in agreement with the previous research [44]. It is pointed out that the adsorption energies (E ad) of H2S and its fragments HS-H, H-S-H and H2-S on the oxygen defected surface are −0.82, −2.44, −1.58 and −2.85 eV, while that on the perfect surface are −0.41, −0.90, −0.83 and 0.24 eV, respectively. The same variation trend is also found on the perfect surface with HS-H having the most negative E ad and H2-S having the positive value [30]. More negative values of E ad on the defected surface suggest that oxygen vacancies are beneficial to the adsorption of H2S, which is in agreement with the previous report [45]. Meanwhile, the distance between the adsorbed H2S and the defected surface is shortened by 1 Å than that on the perfect surface, suggesting oxygen vacancy on the surface can act as the H2S capture center. Moreover, with the decomposition of H2S, the S atom approximately occupies the oxygen vacancy site and forms two covalent STi bonds of 2.34 Å on the defected surface, which results in the quiet stable product configuration. This can facilitate the decomposition of H2S on the defected surface and make the reaction proceed more easily. Furthermore, the energy barriers (ΔE a) along the whole reaction paths are calculated and displayed in Fig. 2c. The reaction energy profiles show that all values of ΔE a obviously decrease on the defected surface, especially for the last step of H2 formation which largely reduces by 1.58 eV, indicating the oxygen vacancy enables to boost H2 formation. Importantly, the rate-determining step is the formation of H2 with the highest ΔE a on the perfect surface as was found in the previous study of H2S desulfurization on anatase TiO2 (0 0 1) [30]. However, the greatly decreased ΔE a leads to the second dissociation step of HS-H to be the rate-determining step on the defected surface and thus H2 can be easily produced as the final product. This indicates the oxygen vacancy can affect the product selectivity of H2S and H2 tends to be the final product on the defected surface. Fig. 3 a displays the interfacial bonding interactions between H2S and the perfect surface. The peaks of S 2p and Ti 3d orbits co-locate at 0 to −2.1 eV area when H2S decomposing into HS-H on the surface, suggesting a covalent bond between Ti and S atoms [27]. Furthermore, H 1s and O 2p peaks at the same deep valence region imply the covalent bonding of HO. The hybrid feature constituted by O 2p and H 1s becomes more evident at the valence area of −7.2 eV when H2S decomposing into H-S-H, which suggests the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, a more obvious covalent state between H and O can be found on the defected surface (Fig. 3b), indicating oxygen vacancies remarkably enhance the interfacial charge transfer. Finally, the hybrid peaks of S 2p and Ti 3d on the defected surface (Fig. 3b) are stronger than that of perfect surface after H2S decomposing into H2-S (Fig. 3a). This proves a stronger bonding interaction of TiS bond on the defected surface, which is consistent with the decomposition process (Fig. 2b). According to the calculation results, surface oxygen vacancy can accelerate the electron transfer and promote H2S decomposition, which is further investigated in the following experimental part."
8,Photoactivity evaluation,"3.2 Photoactivity evaluation Theoretical results indicate oxygen vacancies have a great effect on the surface electronic properties and facilitate the decomposition of H2S. Herein, the influence on photocatalytic H2 production is further studied. The photocatalytic activity of prepared samples is shown in Fig. 4 , TO exhibits poor hydrogen evolution, whereas the photocatalytic H2 production from H2S gradually enhances as the quality of reduction reagent on the composite increases. Among them, TOV3 shows the highest H2 production than other oxygen vacancies modified TO and the H2 production rate reaches a maximum value of 95.25 μmol g−1 h−1, which is approximately 4.44 times higher than TO (Fig. 4b), demonstrating that oxygen vacancies on TO can enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution greatly. Meanwhile, the cycle and long-time experiments of TOV3 (Fig. 4c and d) reveal the hydrogen evolution increases steadily, indicating TO with oxygen vacancies is extraordinarily stable under the circumstance of H2S. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is slightly decreased after cycle experiments for 3 times (Fig. 4c), suggesting that some oxygen vacancies may be filled during sample recovering. In summary, oxygen vacancies can evidently and steadily enhance H2 production. Based on the above activity results, the following characterizations including the crystal structure, morphology, surface chemical state and optoelectronic properties are adopted to explore the reason for the high H2 production performance on TOVx."
9,"Structure, morphology and chemical states","3.3 Structure, morphology and chemical states XRD is applied to explore the crystal structure change after doping oxygen vacancies. Fig. S2 reveals that there is no obvious shift of diffraction peaks, and all samples display nearly same XRD patterns, which are consistent with the anatase TiO2 (PDF-21-1272) [46,47]. This means the oxygen vacancies play little effect on the crystal structure, especially for the phase transformation [26]. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of TO and TOV3 (Fig. S3) are similar and display the type IV according to IUPAC [48]. Pore-size distribution curves reveal a mesoporous property and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis exhibits that the surface area is 68.76 m2 g−1 and 48.43 m2 g−1 for TO and TOV3, respectively. In view of TOV3 exhibits much higher hydrogen evolution efficiency, it can be concluded that the oxygen vacancies as the surface active sites play an important role in enhancing the H2 production rather than the surface area. TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) are studied for exploring the morphology and microstructure of TO and TOV3. Fig. 5 demonstrates that as-synthesized TiO2 nanocrystals are the quite unitary nanosheets. The size of TO and TOV3 (Fig. 5a and c) are between 40 and 60 nm with thicknesses between 10 and 15 nm. All of these microscopic traits are coincident with previous reported works [49,50]. The lattice spacing of 0.19 nm with an interfacial angle of 90° suggests the two planes of {1 0 0} and {0 1 0} (Fig. 5b and d), and the nanosheets should be mainly exposed with {0 0 1} facets [51]. To fairly comprehend the surface chemical environment of TO and TOV3, chemical valence state of Ti 2p and O 1s are analyzed by XPS. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the peaks at 464.3 and 458.6 eV of TO are attributed to Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 with +4 valence [52,53]. In comparison, the evident shifts to lower energy of Ti 2p for TOV3 suggests the augment of spare electrons and the presence of Ti3+, which is consistent with the calculated difference charge density maps that the spare electrons transfer from oxygen vacancy to the adjacent Ti atoms [54,55]. Fig. 6b shows the XPS spectrum of O 1s. Three kinds of oxygen atoms are assigned to the O lattice of TO, oxygen neighboring to Ti3+ species and surface hydroxyl group with binding energies at 529.8, 531.7 and 533.5 eV, respectively [56,57]. Notably, a broader O 1 s peak with a strong shoulder is observed at 531.2 eV in TOV3, meaning that oxygen vacancies are introduced into the surface successfully. Meanwhile, the O1s spectrum of TOV3 shows the peak at 533.5 eV shifting to higher energy after surface oxygen vacancies doping, indicating spare electrons may transfer from O to Ti. This phenomenon also can be found in Ti 2p (Fig. 6a) and the difference charge density maps ( Fig. 1b). At the same time, EPR is carried out to explore the presence of oxygen vacancies. The strong signal appearing at g = 2.004 of TOV3 (Fig. 7 ) confirms the existence of a large number of oxygen vacancies [58,59]."
10,Optical and photoelectric properties,"3.4 Optical and photoelectric properties According to the above analysis, oxygen vacancies play little effect on the crystal structure and morphology, and the reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity is still unclear and is further explored. As is known, there are two important reasons for highly H2 evolution, (i) light absorption; (ii) the separation of photo-generated carriers. Therefore, the UV–vis spectrum and the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum are applied to evaluate the change of light absorption and photo-induced carrier recombination of TO and TOVx, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 a, samples’ color gradually changes from white to grey when the oxygen vacancies are increased, which is beneficial to the visible-light absorption. This can be proved by the obvious redshifts of the absorption edges for the oxygen defected surface in the UV–vis spectrum. Meanwhile, Kubelka-Munk function spectrum (the insert in Fig. 8a) proves the same results that the E g of TO is narrowed after oxygen vacancies doping which agrees with the calculation results, and TOV3 exhibits the most broadened absorption edge among all the samples, which may contribute to the highest photoactivity towards H2 evolution. Furthermore, the PL spectrum (Fig. 8b) illustrates that the recombination of photo-generated carrier has a trend to decrease with the increment of oxygen vacancies since the oxygen vacancies can act as the carrier separation center [60]. Actually, the same result also can be observed in the time-resolved fluorescence spectrum (Fig. S4). After the introduction of oxygen vacancies, the average lifetime of TOV3 is lengthened compared to TO, indicating more photo-generated electrons on the defected surface can participate in the reaction under the light irradiation and thus enhance the photocatalytic performance. However, TOV4 shows the lowest PL intensity but with much lower photocatalytic activity than TOV3, illustrating that photocatalytic activity may be affected by the co-action of light absorption and the behavior of carrier separation. Transient photocurrent responses of TO and TOV3 are measured under periodical light on-off cycles to characterize the separation of carriers (Fig. 9 a). After 5 cycles of every cycle lasted for 60 s, the system photocurrent intensity of TOV3 (1.0 μA cm−2) is larger than perfect TO (0.7 μA cm−2). Corresponding electrochemical impedance spectrum (Fig. 9b) displays TOV3 has the lowest electrochemical impedance under light field, which is in accord with the result of PL spectrum. Therefore, oxygen vacancies can broaden the light absorption and promote photo-generated electrons-holes pairs separation, and thus enhancing the H2 production activity. The difference charge density (perfect surface: Fig. 9c–f; defected surface: Fig. 9g–j) reveals the interfacial charge transfer. Electrons are mainly concentrated between S and H when H2S is located at Ti, and a small amount is concentrated between H and O (Fig. 9c). This phenomenon also can be seen on the defected surface. After H2S decomposing into HS-H in Fig. 9d, it can be clearly seen that numbers of electrons are accumulated between S and Ti. When H2S is decomposed into H-S-H (Fig. 9e), electrons accumulate between Ti and S, H and O leading to the formation of STi and OH bond. The same case also can be found in the PDOS (Fig. 3a). When H2S is decomposed into H2-S (Fig. 9f and j), the degree of electron accumulation between S and Ti at the interface reaches the maximum, and the length between S and Ti is of 2.34 Å on the defected surface, suggesting a covalent bond has formed, which also can be seen in the PDOS (Fig. 3b) and the decomposition process (Fig. 2b). At the same time, the distance between H2 and the defected surface is farther than H2 on the perfect surface, proving that oxygen vacancies on the surface can boost H2 desorption. To verify this, the charge transfer quality (q) is examined on the defected surface (Fig. 9g–j) as well as the perfect surface (Fig. 9c–f). It is seen that the charge transfer is obviously larger during the whole adsorption and dissociation processes of H2S on the defected surface compared to the perfect surface, which shows the oxygen vacancies can greatly promote electron transfer at the surface and result in the facile decomposition of H2S on the defected surface. The same variation trend can be found for H2S dissociation on rutile TiO2 {1 1 0} in the previous reports [34,61]. For instance, the q of H2S molecule adsorption is 0.118 and 0.115 e on the defected and perfect anatase TiO2 {0 0 1}, which is larger than 0.05 e on the oxygen defected rutile TiO2 {1 1 0} and 0.03 e on the perfect surface. The changes of work function (Φ) are further investigated to understand the electron behaviors between the surface and adsorbates as displayed in Fig. S5. It is found that Φ is 3.9 eV for the oxygen defected TiO2 {0 0 1}, which is smaller than that of 5.2 eV for the perfect surface, indicating oxygen vacancy may provide electrons to the surface as found in Fig. 1. Upon the adsorption of H2S, both values of Φ are decreased by 0.1 and 0.6 eV for the defect and perfect surfaces, and the defect surface maintains the smaller Φ due to the stronger interaction between H2S molecule and surface. This shows the oxygen defected surface can offer more electrons to facilitate the decomposition of H2S, which can also be proved by the difference charge maps in Fig. 9. Hence, these results prove that oxygen vacancies can intensively improve the photocatalytic activities of photo-splitting of H2S owing to favorable carrier separation efficiency, which is consistent with the analysis of band structure and PL test. According to the above results, TOV3 is proved to be a desirable photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution, even though the surface area is not as good as the pristine TO, which shows the efficient charge separation has a crucial influence on the photocatalytic activities of hydrogen evolution."
11,Conclusions,"This work determines that oxygen vacancies play a quite positive role in promoting the photo-splitting of H2S. The introduction of oxygen vacancy induces an intermediate energy level and reduces the band gap, which is in accord with the Uv–vis test. It also greatly improves the surface adsorption ability for the adsorption and dissociation of H2S with more negative adsorption energies of −0.82 to −2.85 eV. Particularly, the energy barrier is reduced by 1.58 eV for the step of H2 formation on the defected surface, and the variation of rate-determining steps affects the product selectivity and results in H2 as the final product. Consequently, the photoactivity of H2 evolution is significantly improved from 21.44 μmol g−1h−1 to 95.25 μmol g−1h−1 on the defected surface, which can be ascribed from the excellent charge separation efficiency observed from the PL, time-resolved fluorescence and transient photocurrent responses tests. These findings can aid in understanding the role of oxygen vacancies in the enhanced mechanism of photo-splitting of H2S over metal oxide photocatalysts."
