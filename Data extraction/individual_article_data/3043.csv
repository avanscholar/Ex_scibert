0,Introduction,"The development of heterogeneous catalytic processes towards to the nitrogen-containing compounds is being made significant contributions in organic chemistry. Amide bond has widespread attention due to the most popular chemical linkages in the scaffold of biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymers, detergents, and as well as natural products [1–4]. The ubiquity of the amide has received considerable attention in numerous laboratory and industrial aspects [5]. Accordingly, extensive efforts have been arisen on the generation of this valuable functional motif through an appropriate strategy in contemporary chemistry. The traditional synthetic process for the preparation of amide involves the reaction of activated carboxylic acids derivatives (acyl halides, anhydrides, esters, etc) or non-activated carboxylic acids with an amine and through coupling reagents [6,7]. Furthermore, other prevalent procedures such as Beckmann rearrangement [8], Ugi [9], Schmidt reaction [10], Staudinger reaction [11], and Ritter have been applied alternatively [12]. Despite important progress achieved, the several drawbacks associated with aforementioned methods such as the use of hazardous reagents, harsh conditions and poor atom-efficiency. Additionally, conversion from an alcohol to an acid adds an extra step, and can be challenging in multifunctional compounds. In this regard, several excellent strategies like transamination of primary amides with amines [13], catalytic hydroamination of alkynes [14], acylation of amines with carboxylic acids [15], and oxidative amidation have been reported during recent decades [16]. Among these protocols, transition-metal-catalyzed oxidative amidation of alcohols emerged as an economical and high atom-efficiency chemical transformation to achieve desired amide. Particularly, the use of readily accessible, stable and inexpensive starting materials, as well as high selectivity and environmentally benign of this approach has led to its potential performance as an attractive synthetic route. Generally, stoichiometric amount of various transition metals such as “Ru” [17], “Rh” [18], “Au” [19], “Ir” [20], and “Cu” have been applied in one-pot processes [21]. From a safety and economic point of view, copper nanoparticles become one of the most affordable and environmentally friendly metals for various applications including oxidation and catalysis [22,23]. On the other hand, presence of the copper–cofactor pairs and Cu+/Cu2+ oxidation-reduction couple in the alcohol oxidation through radical copper oxidases lead to using various copper catalysts and organic radicals for this process [24]. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles is considerably limited by agglomeration. Indeed, controlling the metal particles size and surface area plays a vital role in their catalytic ability [25]. In this context, the immobilization of metal nanoparticles to the appropriate solid support with large surface area and ideal surface interfacial effects could prevent aggregation and therefore enhances the catalytic performance. Over the past few years, have witnessed intensive research on the properties and applications of 2D polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a promising class of carbonaceous materials. g-C3N4-based nanocomposite have attracted immense consideration for various applications including photodegradation of dyes [26], solar cells [27,28], supercapacitor devices [29], water splitting [30], sensors [31], hydrogen evolution [32,33], metal-free heterogeneous catalysts [34–36], reduction [37], and oxidation [38,39] due to its notable merits like synthesis using widely affordable materials (e.g., melamine, urea, thiourea, cyanamide), large specific surface area, high thermal and chemical resistance and unique electronic structure. More interestingly, owning to incorporation of nitrogen atoms in to carbon architecture that related to condensation of amino functional groups with tertiary and aromatic amines, the g-C3N4 can utilize as an effective support material with electron-rich surface and active chemical sites for loading nanoparticles [40]. In addition, immobilization of metal particles onto the g-C3N4 matrix improves its catalytic performance through production of delocalized electrons as well as promotion of photo-induced charge separation at the interface of the metals and substrates [41,42]. To increase the adsorption capacity, active chemical sites, specific surface area, and pore volume of graphitic carbon nitride which improves its performance as a catalyst support, creating of porosity in its structure and generating well-ordered mesoporous g-C3N4 is a more interest solution [43]. Great efforts have been made to prepare mesoporous g-C3N4 using different strategies during recent years [44,45]. A common method towards the preparation of ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride is a hard or soft templating method. In spite of the facile one-pot feature of soft templating method, the obtained mesoporous g-C3N4 via this protocol shows a lower surface area as well as it cannot always control the size and morphology of mesoporous g-C3N4 [46]. As a result, Applying the hard template synthesis method using mesoporous silica (SBA-15, FDU-12, KIT-6, and INC-2) to achieve controlled mesoporous structure g-C3N4 with higher surface area have been widely applied during recent years [47]. Given the notable advantages of SBA-15 materials such as synthesis by using inexpensive precursor (tetraethyl orthosilicate) at low temperature under simple preparation method, tunable pore size and high hydrothermal stability, SBA-15 is the most appropriate material to prepare mesoporous g-C3N4 with high surface area [48]. Based on our general interest in carbon based heterogeneous catalysis, due to the intriguing properties of well-ordered mesoporous g-C3N4 as a host material to enhance the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles, and in pursuit of our previous efforts to synthesize efficient polymeric supported heterogeneous catalysts for the preparation of valuable chemical compounds [49–53], herein we have attempted to introduce a new heterogeneous catalytic process consisting of g-C3N4-based material modified by copper (Cu/g-C3N4) for the one-pot direct oxidative amidation of benzyl alcohols with amine hydrochloride salts under mild conditions (Scheme 1 ). Specially, Cu/g-C3N4 was prepared and characterized as a novel and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst via a simple preparation method for the first time. It is noteworthy that, immobilization of Cu particles as a low-cost and available metal onto the g-C3N4 matrix leads to the improvement of catalytic performance in the generation of desired products with high to moderate yields. Moreover, the reusability of this novel and environmentally friendly catalyst did not show a significant decrease after up to six runs."

8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations The bonding and chemical characteristics of the prepared samples (g-C3N4 and Cu/g-C3N4) can be revealed by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1, the broad peak located in the region of 3000–3500 cm−1 could be ascribed to the stretching vibration of the N-H of NH2 and –NH groups that are present on the g-C3N4 framework. The obvious peaks from 1234 to 1641 cm−1 represent the C–N stretching vibrations of the C–N heterocycle. Additionally, the intense peak at 806 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of tri-s-triazine units. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of the Cu/g-C3N4 demonstrated the same characteristic absorptions, suggesting that immobilization of Cu ions had no evident influence on the chemical structure of g-C3N4 support. The pore structure of the prepared graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. 2 ). As previously reported in the literature, SBA-15 exhibits three main peaks correspond to the (100), (110), and (200) planes of the highly ordered 2D hexagonal lattice in small-angle region of XRD pattern [46]. As shown in small-angle X-ray diffraction pattern of the well-ordered mesoporous g-C3N4, there is a decrease and broadness in the intensity of these peaks, which indicate that a low ordering structure for the g-C3N4 was obtained after removing SBA-15, as the hard silica template. The results of the small angle region of XRD pattern for prepared g-C3N4 are similar to the described in the literature [46,55]. Chen et al. reported the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of ompg-C3N4 [56]. The powder X–ray diffraction pattern of the ompg-C3N4 in this report in the 2θ range from 0.5° to 2.0° exhibited very similar diffraction pattern with as-prepared g-C3N4 (Fig. 2a). The wide-angle X-ray diffraction pattern of the g-C3N4 confirms the phase structure of the graphitic carbon nitride (Fig. 2b). It shows two obvious peaks at 2θ = 27.4° and 13.6°, attributed to the interlayer stacking reflection (002) of the conjugated aromatic segments and in-plane structural packing motif of tri-s-triazine rings (100) respectively. As evidence from the XRD pattern of the Cu/g-C3N4, the typical peaks of the g-C3N4 are retained after the immobilization of Cu ions. The EDX spectrum and elemental mapping of the Cu/g-C3N4 depicts only C, N, Cu, and very low amount of oxygen (O) elements present in the structure of the prepared catalyst and there was no evidence of a Si peak in the EDX spectra, which suggest that the SBA-15 was removed successfully (Fig. 3 ). The presence of a low amount of oxygen can be attributed to the adsorbed water by pore channels of g-C3N4, which is confirmed by TGA-DTA analysis. The quantitative analysis by using by ICP-OES proved the presence of Cu at 4.36 wt%. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the g-C3N4 and Cu/g-C3N4 were also carried out to confirm the immobilization of the Cu species on the g-C3N4 (Fig. 4 ). DTA and TGA diagrams of the g-C3N4 exhibit that the g-C3N4 as catalyst support is stable up to ~600 °C. The first weight loss step (~6% at 100–200 °C) is associated with the removal of adsorbed water by pore channels, while the other loss step at about 600 °C is due to the decomposition of the g-C3N4 structure. As can be seen that the immobilization of Cu2+ into g-C3N4 framework (Cu/g-C3N4) displays a low loss in the thermal stability compared to g-C3N4 due to the incorporation of Cu ions into the tri-s-triazine units. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were applied to study the BET surface area and pore structure of the g-C3N4. Fig. 5 indicates the hysteresis loop of the g-C3N4, which regards as the typical type IV isotherm, suggesting the presence of the mesopore structure. The specific BET surface area (SBET), pore size, and BJH pore volume of the g-C3N4 are summarized in Table 1 . These results revealed that the large specific surface area and suitable BJH pore volume of the g-C3N4 (73.8 m2 g−1 and 0.128 cm3 g−1 respectively) can afford a favorable space for immobilization of copper ions. FE-SEM was applied to further verify the successful synthesis of the ordered mesoporous structure graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The FE-SEM images of the g-C3N4 (Fig. 6 a, b, c) evidently prove that the distinctive rod-like morphology of the silica hard template (SBA-15) is replicated in the ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride. From the FE-SEM images, Cu/g-C3N4 maintains the rod-like structure of g-C3N4 and illustrates that Cu species are immobilized on the surface of g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 6 (e, f), the Cu species are uniformly distributed on the g-C3N4 and also the structure with typical rod-like morphology of the Cu/g-C3N4 was proved."
10,Catalytic properties,"3.2 Catalytic properties After characterization, the merit of the Cu/g-C3N4 for catalyzing tandem oxidative amidation of benzyl alcohols with different types of amine hydrochloride salts was evaluated. In order to found the optimal conditions, the amidation of benzylamine hydrochloride and benzyl alcohol was chosen as a model reaction (Scheme 2 ). As can be seen, the presence of catalyst and oxidant have a key role in the transformation (Table 2, entries 1, 2). The reaction was performed with Cu/g-C3N4 (10 mg) in the presence of TBHP as oxidizing reagent at room temperature in acetonitrile under N2 atmosphere. In these conditions, the desired product was gained in 30% yield (Table 2, entry 3). In the following, the influential parameters such as temperature, solvent, oxidant, and the amount of catalyst were investigated in the model reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature from 25 °C to 80 °C improved the product yield, whereas a further increase to 100 °C the yield of the desired amide decreased to 75% (Table 2, entries 3–7). This observation owing to the enhanced oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid as a byproduct at the higher temperature. Also, the model reaction was carried out in the different amount of the Cu/g-C3N4 (Table 2, entries 5–8). As shown in Table 2, using 20 mg of the catalyst (Cu/g-C3N4) increased the amide product in high yield. Further optimization experiments manifested the importance of base for this direct amide formation (Table 2, entries 6, 9, 10). Among the different bases examined, including K2CO3, CaCO3, and Na2CO3, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minimizes the undesired amine oxidation reaction through the slow formation of the amine. Afterward, the different types of oxidants on the progress of the reaction was studied. Hence, various oxidants (TBHP, H2O2, and O2) employed for this transformation (Table 2, entries 6, 11, 12). Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was the most effective oxidant for tandem oxidative amidation reaction. Subsequently, acetonitrile was the best solvent and gave the highest desired product yield. The oxidative amidation reaction did not proceed well in other solvents like DMF and DMSO (Table 2, entries 13, 14). To demonstrate the efficiency of the Cu/g-C3N4 in the tandem oxidative amidation reaction, other catalysts like g-C3N4, CuCl2, and the mixture of g-C3N4 and CuCl2 were evaluated in the model reaction under the optimized conditions (Table 3 ). These results suggest that Cu/g-C3N4 has high efficiency to progress the oxidative amidation reaction as compared to other catalysts and prove that copper plays a constructive role in the oxidation catalytic cycle. To explore the substrate scope and limitation of the tandem oxidative amidation reaction, a series of benzyl alcohols with amine hydrochloride salts were examined under the optimized conditions: 1.5 mmol benzyl alcohol, 1.0 mmol amine hydrochloride salt, CH3CN (3 mL), 1.1 equiv. CaCO3, 4 equiv. TBHP, and 20.0 mg Cu/g-C3N4 at 80 °C under N2 atmosphere (Table 4 ). As illustrated in Table 4, the corresponding substituted amides were achieved in moderate to excellent yields. Generally, benzyl alcohols contain electron-donating substituents such as –OMe, Me were found to proceed well and give the desired amide in excellent yields. Similarly, the analogous amidation with starting alcohols containing electron-withdrawing substituent such as –NO2, -Cl afforded desired amide products in moderate yields. Furthermore, both primary and secondary amine hydrochloride salts were successfully employed in this process to give the desired secondary and tertiary amides with good to moderate yields. As demonstrated in Table 4, the tandem oxidative amidation was also conducted by using aliphatic and aromatic amines like benzylamine, aniline, and 2-aminopyridine with the good yields of the corresponding amides, whereas morpholine as a secondary amine exhibited lower reactivity (Table 4, entry 10). Based on the obtained results and previous reports [69], a plausible mechanism has been shown in Scheme 3 . Firstly, the aldehyde as a known intermediate in this reaction is formed via free radical mechanism oxidation of alcohol by the existence of catalyst Cu/g-C3N4 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). Afterward, the aldehyde reacts with the free amine, which generated from deprotonation of the amine hydrochloride salt with calcium carbonate, to give a hemiaminal intermediate (III). Then the treatment of Cu2+ ions of the catalyst (Cu/g-C3N4) with TBHP can produce tert-butylperoxyl radical. This active species (tert-butylperoxyl radical) takes hydrogen from the hemiaminal intermediate (III) leads to formation intermediate (IV). Finally, this intermediate oxidized to the desired amide by Cu(II)-TBHP catalytic system through a free radical mechanism with elimination of tert-butanol. To further approve the free radical pathway of this reaction, the radical trapping experiment was carried out. 1 equiv. of 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) as a free radical inhibitor was added in the model reaction mixture and no product formation was observed, suggesting that the tandem oxidative amidation reaction proceeded through free radical mechanism. To evaluate the stability and reusability of the heterogeneous Cu/g-C3N4 catalyst, the recycle experiments of tandem oxidative amidation reaction between benzyl alcohol and benzylamine hydrochloride salt were performed under the optimized reaction conditions and the obtained results are presented in Fig. 7 . It was clearly seen that the catalytic activity of the Cu/g-C3N4 has no obvious decrease even after six cycles of the reaction. Additionally, the leaching of the copper after the recycling test was determined by ICP-OES analysis. The copper content was 4.36% before the tandem oxidative amidation reaction and 4.35% after the sixth cycle, which confirms that the absence of Cu leaching during the reaction. To further prove the stability of Cu/g-C3N4, Fourier transform infrared spectra of the fresh and recycled heterogeneous catalyst (Cu/g-C3N4) have been provided (Fig. 8 ). Due to the FT-IR analysis, the chemical structure of the recycled Cu/g-C3N4 after oxidative amidation reaction exhibits no appreciable change."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, Cu/g-C3N4 catalysts was successfully synthesized through facile in situ immobilization of Cu (II) on the porous g-C3N4 from low-cost cyanamide exhibited significantly enhanced performance towards tandem amidations of alcohols under mild conditions. The simply polymerized heterogeneous catalyst showed impressive catalytic performance in the tandem oxidative amidation reaction for the synthesis of various amides. The advantages of the present method are short reaction times, straightforward preparation, stability, and recyclability of the catalyst (Cu/g-C3N4) up to six times which demonstrated no metal leaching occurred during the oxidative amidation reaction."
