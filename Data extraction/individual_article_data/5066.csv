0,Introduction,"Preservation is an important component of food processing, aimed at prolonging the shelf-life of food products without altering its sensory and nutritional qualities. Food preservatives inhibits microbial proliferation and chemical/enzymatic oxidative reactions capable of rendering food products unfit for consumption. The use of chemical preservatives and additives in food have in the recent years attracted strict scrutiny from food regulators, scientist, and consumers. Health reports associating certain chemical-based food additives to disease conditions have triggered a fresh search for healthy alternative preservatives. Plants are rich source of medically relevant compounds, functional foods and food additives (Calderaro et al., 2020) with immeasurable opportunities for new drug discoveries (Sharma et al., 2020) and potentials applications in the food industries. As consumer’s distaste for synthetic chemical food additives soars, and the demand for green consumerism heightens, natural products from plants offers a warehouse of untapped resource. The bioactivities of plant are attributed to abundance of potent phytochemical compounds, including polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenes, glycosides, and alkaloids. The plant Eucalyptus camaldulensis, native to Australia and the Southeast Asia is used in folk medicine to the relieve various symptoms including cough, sore throat, and sinusitis. In Thailand, 70–80% of tree trunk is used in paper and pulp industry, 10–15 percent is used for charcoal and 5 percent is used for construction poles, leaving behind huge amounts of waste including leaves and branches (Gumartini, 2009). Although the actual quantity of waste leaves generated in Thailand is undocumented, biomass in terms of branches and leaves from Eucalyptus is estimated at 2.8 million tonnes/year for Spain and Portugal (Celia Martinez et al., 2018). In addition, the plant is a rich source of bioactive essential oil, flavonoid and phenolic compounds (Nasr et al., 2019) that can be used as medicines and food preservatives. The bioactivity of essential oils from this plant and its major active volatile compound 1,8-cinole (Sabo & Knezevic, 2019) has been extensively studied. However, elaborate studies on its abundant phytochemicals, including cytocompatibility evaluations, medical and therapeutic applications are still lacking. Crude extracts of the leaves have been reported to contain phenolics and flavonoids with antioxidant and antimicrobial effects against various pathogenic microorganisms, including the recalcitrant foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Nwabor et al., 2019). Leaf extract of the plant exhibited membrane disruption effects and anti-virulence activities on the Gram-positive foodborne pathogen L. monocytogenes. Plant phytochemicals are used in food as colourant, flavours, preservative, and taste enhancers. Antioxidant phytochemicals prolongs food shelf-life by inhibiting free radical mediated oxidations (Ng et al., 2019), whereas the antimicrobials components prevents microbial mediated food spoilage as well as foodborne disease outbreaks. The aim of this study was to analyze the phytochemical compositions of ethanolic and aqueous fractions of E. camaldulensis leave extract, and evaluate the bioactivities, including antimicrobial potentials against pathogenic bacterial isolates, antioxidant, cytocompatibility and oxidative stress ameliorating effects. The study presents foremost report of E. camaldulensis as a source of functional compound that can be used in oxidative stress reduction and control."

3,Bacterial strains and culture conditions,"2.2 Bacterial strains and culture conditions Five bacterial isolates including L. monocytogenes (PSU-KV-039) isolated from ready to eat food, (PSU-KV-148), isolated from food processing environment, (F2365) a standard listeria strain, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and an isolate of Bacillus cereus were used in this study. All bacterial cultures were maintained in TSB supplemented with 35% glycerol and kept at −80 °C."
4,Preparation of plant fractions,"2.3 Preparation of plant fractions Waste E. camaldulensis were obtained from a paper industry in Northern Thailand. The leaves were identified at the faculty of Thai Traditional Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand and were washed, and oven dried at 40 °C. The dried leaves were pulverized using a 500 g Multi-function disintegrator WF-10B, (Yongkang Tianqi Shengshi Industry and Trade Co. Ltd, Yongkang, Zhejiang, China). Pulverized leaves were extracted by macerating with 70% ethanol (Olatunde et al., 2020), at a solute to solvent ratio of 1:10, with constant stirring using WiseStir® High Torque Stirrer HT120AX, (Witeg Labortechnik GmbH, Wertheim, Germany), for 4 h. The extraction was carried out as previously described (Eze and Tola, 2020). In brief, the extract was filtered, with Whatman No 1, and the filtrate was concentrated using a rotavapor at 40 °C until the ethanol was completely evaporated and left to sediment overnight at 4 °C. Sediments were collected and the filtrate was further centrifuged at 100 × g for 30 min to sediment the precipitated ethanol soluble components. After centrifugation, supernatant was further concentrated using a SpeedVac Vacuum concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, United States) to ensure complete elimination of remnant ethanol. Both the precipitated ethanol soluble component and the supernatant containing the water-soluble components were freeze dried and collected as powder. Percentage yield of the extract and fractions were calculated."
5,Antimicrobial activities of fractions against pathogenic food isolates,"2.4 Antimicrobial activities of fractions against pathogenic food isolates The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the fractions against the tested bacterial isolates was determined using the standard broth microdilution method (CLSI, 2017). Overnight bacterial cultures grown in TSB were adjusted to 106 CFU/mL and treated with varying 2-fold dilutions of the fractions. The MICs were determined using MHB, after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The MIC values were recorded as the lowest concentration that completely inhibited the bacterial growth. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined using drop plate technique and recorded as the lowest concentrations that showed no growth on TSA plates after incubation for 24 h. All the experiments were set up in triplicates for two independent studies."

Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The cultures were adjusted to 108 CFU/mL and treated with MIC and 2MIC of fractions, for 2 h. Cells were then harvested at 8000 × g, for 5 min and the pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 10 µg/mL of crystal violet for 10 min. Cultures treated with 0.1% DMSO were used as negative controls. Experiments were performed in triplicate for two independent trials and the crystal violet uptake was calculated as described (Nwabor et al., 2019)."

Cell free supernatant from treated L. monocytogenes cultures, were tested against 5% red blood cells. A 1% Triton X-100 solution was used as positive control, whereas PBS was used as negative control (0% haemolysis). Absorbance at 600 nm were read and percentage haemolysis was calculated using the formula (Du et al., 2018). (2.1) % H a e m o l y s i s = ( A s - A n ) ÷ ( A p - A n ) × 100 where As, An and Ap are absorbance values for sample, negative and positive controls."
8,Determination of total phenolic and total flavonoid content,"2.7 Determination of total phenolic and total flavonoid content The phenolic contents of the plant fractions were determined spectrophotometrically by Folin–Ciocalteu's (Gonçalves et al., 2019), and expressed as gallic acid equivalent/mg of fraction. The total flavonoid contents were determined by aluminium chloride method (Nwabor et al., 2019), and expressed quercetin equivalent/mg of fraction."
9,Phytochemical profiling using Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy,"2.8 Phytochemical profiling using Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy The extract (40 mg/ml) was prepared in chloroform. The solution was centrifuge at 8,950 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 µm nylon filter and the filtrates were analysed by Liquid chromatography coupled with a high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer G6550A (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) and an Agilent Mass Hunter Software version B.05.01 (B512.5). Sample ionization was achieved using a dual AJS ESI in an Auto MS2 mode. The LC separation was achieved on a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18,100 × 2.1 mm i.d., particle size 1.8 μm (Agilent Technologies), at 40 °C.

10,Fourier transformed infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of fractions,"2.9 Fourier transformed infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of fractions Chemical structures of the aqueous and ethanol soluble fractions from E. camaldulensis leaf were analysed by FTIR spectrometry with resolution of 4 cm−1, aperture setting of 6 mm scanner velocity of 2.2 kHz. The spectra were obtained using a Vertex 70 FTIR (Bruker, Ettlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). The proton NMR spectra of the fractions were recorded using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrophotometer Bruker Advanced II 400 (Massachusetts, US), with base frequency of 400 MHz and delay time of 1.5 s."
11,Determination of antioxidant activities of ethanol and aqueous soluble fractions,"2.10 Determination of antioxidant activities of ethanol and aqueous soluble fractions The antioxidant properties of the fractions were evaluated by the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. DPPH was determined by the spectrophotometric method (Liu et al., 2020). Briefly, fresh solution of DPPH radicals (0.15 M) was prepared in methanol. Aliquot 100 µL of varying concentrations of each in ethanol was added to 100 µL of DPPH solution, and incubated in the dark for 30 min, and absorbance values at 517 nm were recorded. Stock ABTS solution was prepared by mixing 1.8 mg/mL aqueous ABTS and 0.66 mg/mL potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) in a 1:1 ratio. The stock was left overnight in the dark to check for stability. ABTS scavenging effects were measured at 734 nm (Re et al., 1999). Ascorbic acid was used as standards. Percentage scavenging activities were calculated and expressed as IC50, using the formula: (2.2) S c a v e n g i n g a c t i v i t y ( % ) = ( A c - A s ) A c × 100 where Ac is the absorbance value for control and As is the absorbance value for treatment. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the fractions was measured using the methods described by Benzie & Strain, (1996). Stock FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing sodium acetate buffer (300 mM), TPTZ solution (10 mM), and FeCl3·6H2O (20 mM) in a 10:1:1 ratio. The reduction reaction was measured at an absorbance of 593 nm, and a standard curve was prepared with F2SO4 as standard. The results were expressed as mg F2SO4 equivalent/mg extract."
12,Cell culture and cytotoxicity of fractions on Caco-2 cells,"2.11 Cell culture and cytotoxicity of fractions on Caco-2 cells Human embryonic colon cells Caco-2 were received from the Department of Physiology, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. The cells were grown in a high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and maintained at 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The cells (104 cell/well) were seeded into 96-well plate and incubated till the formation of monolayer. The cells were allowed to form confluent monolayer (Juan-García et al., 2019), and were treated with sub-bactericidal concentrations of aqueous fraction (5–632 µg/mL) and ethanolic fraction (2–256 µg/mL) to analyse the direct effect of the fractions on Caco-2 cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Toxicity of the plant fractions was evaluated using the MTT assay. The insoluble formazan crystals were solubilized with 99.9% DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a multi-mode plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell viability was calculated as"
13,Toxicity of H2O2 on Caco-2 cell,"2.12 Toxicity of H2O2 on Caco-2 cell The H2O2-induced oxidative damage model was established with MTT assay (An et al., 2020). Briefly, confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cell were incubated with varying concentrations of H2O2 (0.8 –10 mM) and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cytotoxic effect of H2O2 on cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay."
14,Plant fractions attenuate H2O2 mediated cytotoxicity,2.13 Plant fractions attenuate H2O2 mediated cytotoxicity Cell monolayers were incubated with varying concentrations of the plant fractions and incubated for 1 h. Optimized concentration of H2O2 (3.0 mM) was added to the cells in the presence of the plant fractions and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 6 h. Cells were then washed and the inhibitory effects of the plant fractions on H2O2 induced was evaluated by measuring the cell mortality using MTT assay at 570 nm.
15,NO amelioratory effects of plant fraction evaluated by Griess assay,"2.14 NO amelioratory effects of plant fraction evaluated by Griess assay The inhibitory activity of E. camaldulensis ethanol and aqueous fractions on nitrite production was evaluated by Griess assay (Abdelwahab et al., 2011) with slight modifications. Confluent cell monolayer was treated with varying concentrations of the plant material for 2 h and exposed to H2O2 (0.375 mM). The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 18 h, and the culture media were assayed for nitrite content. Briefly, 50 µL of culture media was transferred to a fresh sterile 96 well plate. A 0.1% N-(l-naphthyl)-ethylene diamine dihydrochloride, dissolved in 2.5% H3PO4 was added and incubated for 10 min, followed by addition of 50 µL of a 1% sulphanilamide and further incubation for 10 min. The absorbance of the resultant colour was measured at 540 nm using a multimode plate reader. Nitrite content of the culture supernatant was calculated from a standard curve of sodium nitrite (0–50 μM) freshly prepared in deionized water."
16,Statistical analysis,"2.15 Statistical analysis All experiments were done in triplicate and values were recorded as mean ± SD. Results were analysed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Statistical Package for Social Sciences 20 (IBM Incoporated, Armonk, New York, USA) was used for the analysis at a 95% confidence interval (Scheffe test at p < 0.05)."
17,Results and discussions,
18,Percerntage yeild of extract and fractions,"3.1 Percerntage yeild of extract and fractions The yeild of the extracts showed that 114.28 g of pulverized leaves yeilded 22.93 g of extracts equivalent to 20.1%, consisting of 19.1 g aqueous soluble fraction equivalent to 16. 71% and 3.83 g alchool soluble fraction equivalent to 3.35%. The results demonstrated abundance of aqueous soluble fractions compared to ethanolic soluble fractions."
19,Antioxidant properties of plant fractions,"3.2 Antioxidant properties of plant fractions Oxidation of food and food products is a major cause of food spoilage, second to microbial mediated food spoilage. Antioxidant compounds such as butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole were extensively employed in food preservation for shelf-life extension. Antioxidant compounds acts as free radical scavengers or quenchers, by truncating cascade oxidative reaction or inhibiting the induction of the oxidative process. The antioxidant properties of the aqueous crude fractions from E. camaldulensis leaf extract is presented in Table 1 . The results showed an IC50 value of 7.07 and 17.96 µg/mL for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. Ethanol crude fraction showed an IC50 value of 65.67 and 201.3 µg/mL for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. IC50 value for ascorbic acid were recorded at 8.71 and 18.8 µg/mL for DPPH and ABTS assays. The IC50 for crude ethanolic extract of the plant was previously recorded at 57.07 and 29.01 µg/mL (Nwabor et al., 2019). In addition, the ferric reducing antioxidant power of the fractions were 149.9 ± 2.31 and 112.2 ± 4.89 mg/mg F2SO4. The excellent antioxidant properties of the plant fractions indicate the rich content of phenolic compounds such as gallic and ellagic acids as well as flavonoids such as quercetin."
20,Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of plant fractions,"3.3 Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of plant fractions The results of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were consistent with that of the LCMS analysis. The aqueous fraction showed a phenolic content of 9.04 ± 0.26 mg GAE/mg and a flavonoid content of 2.07 ± 0.02 mg QE/mg, whereas the ethanol fraction showed a phenolic and flavonoid content of 3.58 ± 0.04 mg GAE/mg and 3.37 ± 0.50 mg QE/mg, respectively (Table 1). The rich phenolic content of the aqueous fraction is responsible for the superior antioxidant activity compared with the ethanol fraction. Plant polyphenols are bioactive agents with potential applications as additive (Bharti & Singh, 2020) or functional foods (Calderaro et al., 2020)."
21,Antibacterial effects on foodborne pathogens,"3.4 Antibacterial effects on foodborne pathogens Antibacterial are widely used in food production as preservatives agents against microbial mediated food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Application of antimicrobial agents in food inhibits the proliferation of spoilage mediators and prolongs the shelf-life of the food product. It is estimated that 1.3 billion tons of food products is lost annually to spoilage (Cichello, 2015), with microbial spoilage accounting for approximately 25% of global lost (Bondi et al., 2014). The antibacterial effects of plant fraction on foodborne pathogens is presented in Table 2 . The MIC values of the ethanol fraction ranged from 16 to 64 µg/mL and MBC ranged from 32 to 256 µg/mL. In contrast, the MIC values of the aqueous fraction ranged from 158 to 316 µg /mL with MBC 316 to > 2528 µg/mL. The antibacterial activities of the fractions against Gram-negative bacterial isolates showed MIC and MBC values higher than the tested concentrations (data not shown). Previous studies have reported that antibacterial activities on Gram-positive and Gram-negative depends on the cellular structures. The presence of a lipopolysaccharide layer on the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is hypothesized to obstruct the penetration of plant extracts into the cell cytoplasmic compartment."
22,Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy,"3.5 Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy The FTIR spectra of the aqueous and ethanol soluble fractions of E. camaldulensis is presented in (Fig. S1). The figure showed functional groups of plant including the OH and CH stretching at 3407 and 3406 cm−1. Peaks at 2925, 2928, and 2956 cm−1 are assigned to the CH stretching. Peak at 2853 and 2870 cm−1 were assigned to the CH2 and CH3 bending vibrations, whereas the peaks at 1727, 1691, 1632, and 1616 cm−1 were ascribed to the CO stretching, NH bending, and CC stretching of aldehydes, primary amides and alkene, respectively. The peak at 1515 cm−1 showed the NO stretching of nitro compounds, and the peak at 1451 and 1445 cm−1 represented the CH bending of alkene. The SO peaks of sulphonamide stretching was located at 1355 and 1383 cm−1 and the CO stretching of alkyl were located at 1228 and 1304 cm−1. The fractions showed difference in peaks position and intensity. The ethanol soluble fractions showed presence of numerous peaks with increased intensity. The presence of numerous peaks in the ethanol soluble fractions indicates the presence of multiple phytochemicals as revealed by the LC MS profile."
23,Molecular identification using NMR,"3.6 Molecular identification using NMR The 1H NMR spectra and proton compositions of aqueous and ethanol soluble fractions of E. camaldulensis leave extract is presented in Fig. S2, Table S1. The results of 1H spectra for aqueous fraction demonstrated presence of singlet at δ 1.4208, 2.7326, 4.2545, 4.7203 and one secondary hydroxyl group at δ 1.6228 – 2.0376. An olefinic proton representing exocyclic bond was presented at δ 7.3203. The 1H spectra for ethanol soluble fraction demonstrated presence of singlet at δ 1.2269, 2.7278, and 5.0437, with a doublet at 10.0236 showing the presence of acyl-phloroglucinol. The results were in agreements with LC-MS, confirming the presence of multiple phytochemicals."
24,Identification of phytochemical components present in fractions,"3.7 Identification of phytochemical components present in fractions The LC MS profile of the aqueous fractions and ethanol fraction are presented in (Table 3 ). The results revealed ten major compounds for the aqueous fraction and twenty-two major compounds for the ethanol fractions. In addition, chromatographic profile showed significant compositional difference between the two fractions. The major phytochemicals present in the fractions were identified as flavones, glycoside, alkaloid, tannins, phenolic compounds and terpenoids. Previous study demonstrated that flavonoids and Phenolic acid possess high biological and pharmacological activity (Santos et al., 2016). Flavonoids exhibits strong antioxidants activity by quenching free radicals through proton transfer and generation of a lesser radical specie. The free radical quenching capability of flavonoids is due to the structure of flavonoids and presence of hydroxyl group in the A and B rings (Mierziak et al., 2014). Terpenoids have been reported to possess antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidants effects (Brahmkshatriya & Brahmkshatriya, 2013). Tannins are water soluble phenolic compounds and possess antioxidant, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties (Amarowicz, 2007). This study is first to explore chemical composition of two soluble fractions from a hydroalcoholic (30:70) leaf extract of E. camaldulensis. It is also interesting to report that each fraction had good profile of bioactive components. In addition, the LC MS profile revealed tentatively new compounds not previously reported for E. camaldulensis, including 3-Ethoxy-4-nitro-1-(4-nitro-3-pyrazolidinyl)-1H-pyrazole (C8H12N6O5) and 4-hydrazinylphthalazin-1-yl) hydrazine, sulfuric acid (C8H14N6O5S) in the aqueous fraction as well as Sialic acid (C11H19NO9) and O-Acetylcyclocalopin A (C17H22O7) for the ethanolic fraction."
25,Effects of plant fractions on the cell membrane of foodborne pathogens,"3.8 Effects of plant fractions on the cell membrane of foodborne pathogens Bacterial membrane is a selective permeable organelle that regulates the movement of molecules in and out of the cell cytoplasmic compartment. Disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, compromise its functionalities, resulting in the influx of molecules and subsequent burst and lysis of cells. In this study ethanol, and aqueous fractions of E. camaldulensis demonstrated membrane disruptive effects on foodborne Gram-positive bacterial isolates, as demonstrated by the crystal violet uptake assay. The results showed an increased crystal violet uptake after one-hour treatment with MIC and 2MIC compared with control (Fig. 1 A and B). The increase in crystal violet uptake indicated the membrane disruptive effect of the plant fraction, resulting in altered permeability. The presence of multiple class of phytochemicals in the plant fractions might be responsible for the membrane disruptive effects observed. Polyphenolic compounds (Wu et al., 2016), and flavonoids (Babii et al., 2016)."
26,Effects of plant fractions on the listeriolysin O production,"3.9 Effects of plant fractions on the listeriolysin O production Listeriolysin O is a haemolysis that promotes bacterial escape from phagosome into the host cell cytosol. It is a key listeria virulence factor that enables invasion and colonization of host cell. In this study, plant fractions at sub-inhibitory concentrations significantly reduced listeriolysin O production for the tested isolates and strain F2365 (Fig. 1C and D). The aqueous fraction showed better listeriolysin O inhibitory activity with 63–98% reduction in listeriolysin O production. Similarly, the ethanol fraction showed 6–92% reduction in listeriolysin O production after treatment for 12 h. The results indicated that both fractions at sub inhibitory concentration could be employed as anti-virulence agent for the management of listerial infections."
27,Cytotoxic effects of plant fractions on Caco-2 cells,"3.10 Cytotoxic effects of plant fractions on Caco-2 cells Food legislations and consumers awareness of adverse health effects associated with most synthetic additives, demands that food additives meet the standard generally accepted as safe status. Hence, toxicological evaluation of substance intended for incorporation in food becomes a necessary requirement. The cytotoxic evaluation of the ethanol and aqueous fractions of E. camaldulensis on human colon epithelia cells Caco-2 at sub-inhibitory and bacteriostatic concentrations revealed high cell viability, >80% (Fig. 1E and F). However, at higher concentrations, a reduction in cell viability was observed at concentrations of ≥ 512 and ≥ 1264 µg/mL for ethanol and aqueous fractions, respectively. Natural products are often assumed safe, however the presence of toxic chemical components might impede usage in products intended for human and animal consumption. The results of this study indicated that irrespective of the numerous phytochemicals present in the plant, both fractions were biocompatibility with human Caco-2 cell. The cytotoxicity of aqueous acetone extracts from E. camaldulensis with Caco-2 cell has been previously reported, with an IC50 of 38.3 µg/mL (Singab et al., 2011). The variation in results might be due to solvent toxicity or presence of phytochemicals that are not soluble in ethanol or water."
28,Attenuation of H2O2–induced cell mortality,"3.11 Attenuation of H2O2–induced cell mortality Enzymatic and chemical oxidation are major cause of food deterioration and loss of organoleptic and nutritional qualities. In addition, cellular oxidation resulting in oxidative stress is responsible for various health conditions including aging, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and stroke (Chatterjee et al., 2019). The mortality of cells was investigated after exposure to varying concentrations of H2O2. The result revealed a concentration dependent reduction in cell viability (Fig. 2 A). Hydrogen peroxide has been reported to mediate cell necrosis and death in both bacterial cells and eucaryotic cell-lines through the induction of intracellular free-radical generation (Tochigi et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2018). Sakuma et al, (2015) reported the necrosis of Caco-2 cells following treatment with H2O2. Exposure of the cells to 2.5 mM of H2O2 resulted in an 88% reduction of cell viability. However, pre-treatment of Caco-2 cells before exposure to H2O2 revealed a protective effect against H2O2 induced cell mortality. In the presence of the ethanol fraction and H2O2 at 3 mM, 15–83% increase in cell viability was observed, whereas the aqueous fraction displayed limited effect with 8–23% increase in cell viability. The results demonstrated that despite the increased concentration of H2O2 (3 mM), the fractions effectively inhibited the generation of free radicals that might induce the necrosis and death of cells. Furthermore, the results showed that 3 mM H2O2 could not obstruct the activities of the fraction. This affirms the excellent antioxidant properties of the fractions, and the presence of phytochemicals including phenolic compounds and flavonoids with potent free radical scavenging activities. In addition, the improved results observed for the ethanolic fraction reflects the abundance of multiple classes of phytochemicals."
29,Plant fractions attenuate H2O2–induced nitrite production,"3.12 Plant fractions attenuate H2O2–induced nitrite production To investigate the ability of the plant fractions to inhibit nitrite production, Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with the plant fractions at sub-cytotoxic concentrations for 2 h and subsequently induced with H2O2 for 12 h. Control wells were not treated with either H2O2 or plant fractions. The results demonstrated that pre-treatment with fractions significantly inhibited H2O2 induced nitrite production in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 3 ). Nitrogen oxides such as NO-2 and NO are oxidative stress precursors that plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis of numerous health conditions (Modun et al., 2014). The induction of iNOS pathway triggers the production of NO, resulting to physiological oxidative imbalance (Poderoso et al., 2019). Plant phytochemicals have been reported to inhibit oxidative stress In vivo (Saleem et al., 2020) and In vitro (Yap et al., 2019). Results of this study shows that antioxidant phytochemicals present in E. camaldulensis can serve as remedies for oxidative stress and oxidative stress induced health problems."
30,Conclusions,"The ethanol soluble fraction of E. camaldulensis yielded numerous phytochemicals with good antibacterial activities against Gram-positive foodborne isolates while the aqueous soluble fraction showed presences of few phytochemicals, with good antioxidant activities. Both fractions demonstrated good activity at sub-inhibitory concentrations against listeriolysin O production, and at supra-inhibitory concentrations disrupted the cell membrane of treated bacterial isolates. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, the fractions demonstrated biocompatibility with human cell line Caco-2 and effectively attenuated H2O2 induced oxidative stress mediated cell death and nitrite production. The findings suggest the potential use and beneficial role of hydro-alcohol E. camaldulensis leaf extract against foodborne pathogens and oxidative stress."
