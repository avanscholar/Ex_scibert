0,Introduction,"Amines are important organic compounds which are found in many natural products, pharmaceuticals, polymers, agrochemicals, textile and plastic chemicals, etc [1–3]. Traditional methods for the synthesis of amines are directly base-promoted N-alkylation of amines with alkyl halides or alcohols [4], reductive amination of carbonyl compounds [5,6], and hydroamination of unsaturated hydrocarbons with amines [7,8]. These methods are not environmentally friendly due to the production of stoichiometric large amounts of waste metal salts. Alternatively, the catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles is one of the high atom economy protocols for synthesizing amines and Schiff bases. In industry, the hydrogenation of nitriles is based on the use of heterogeneous catalysts (typically cobalt [9], Rh [10], and palladium [11–13]), but they often suffer from low selectivity and limited functional group tolerance. During the catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles, primary, secondary imines, and even tertiary amines may be produced with less selectivity. The use of soluble metal complexes mainly based on ruthenium [14,15], rhodium [16], and iridium [17] to control selectivity is an attractive and successful alternative, which generally exhibits better performance in the selective synthesis of primary amines under milder reaction conditions. Nevertheless, due to environmental issues and costs, it is a desirable task to develop homogeneous catalytic protocols using earth-abundant transition-metal-based catalysts which are less expensive and less toxic. It is worth noting that the application of iron [18–26], cobalt [27–34], and manganese [35–40] catalysts has been achieved great success in the past few years. In 2014, Beller et al. reported the selective synthesis of primary amines and diamines from the corresponding nitriles and dinitriles by iron PNP-pincer complex catalyzed hydrogenation [22]. In 2015, Milstein and co-workers presented the catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines by cobalt pincer complex [30]. In 2016, Beller et al. studied the selective catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines with the Fe(PNPCy) pincer complex [23]. In 2016, Beller and co-workers demonstrated the hydrogenation of nitriles and cabonyl compounds by Mn(I) PNP-pincer complex [37]. In 2017, Beller et al. accomplished the selective production of primary amines with the use of a mixture of Co(acac)3 and a tetradentate phosphine [34]. In 2017, Fout and coworkers developed the use of a cobalt NHC-based CCC-pincer complex that assisted by a Lewis acid catalyzed selective hydrogenation of nitriles to yield primary amines [28]. Most of these investigations are restricted to the synthesis primary amine and very few studies have been reported on secondary imines. Selective hydrogenation of nitriles to secondary imines is a challenging task due to the difficulty in controlling the selectivity for imines. In 2009, Garcia and co-workers prepared secondary imines by a homogeneous Ni-catalyzed hydrogenation of nitriles [41]. However, this reaction requires a higher reaction temperature (140–180 °C) and the reaction substrate is limited. In 2014, Berke et al. demonstrated the hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding secondary imines catalyzed by non-noble molybdenum and tungsten pincer complexes, requiring high temperature and pressure (140 °C, 60 bar of H2) [42]. In 2015, Prechtl and co-workers reported the hydrogenation of nitriles to secondary imines catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer complex under mild conditions (90 °C, 4 bar of H2), while the reaction substrate is limited [43]. In 2017, Milstein and Chakraborty reported selective catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to secondary imines with the use of iron pincer complex [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)Br(CO)] (1) as a catalyst precursor (1 mol %) in the presence of NaHBEt3 (1 mol %) and benzene as solvent (Scheme 1 ) [20]. The method is the first iron-catalyzed hydrogenation of nitriles to selectively form secondary imines under the mild condition (90 °C, 30 bar H2). The method gets a good selectivity with fewer by-products. Milstein and co-workers have proposed a nitrile hydrogenation mechanism for related ion catalyst [20]. Although the aforementioned mechanism is plausible, many details of the mechanisms (including competitive pathways, key intermediates, rate determining steps and rate determining barrier height) have not been revealed. In recent years, hydrogenation of acetonitrile catalyzed by some cheap metals has been reported. The first example of cobalt-catalyzed selective hydrogenation of nitrile to secondary imines was published by Liang and coworkers in 2018 [33]. A variety of aromatic and aliphatic nitriles are hydrogenated to the corresponding secondary imines. The reaction under relatively mild conditions (100 °C, 62 atm)with generally high conversions and high selectivity. 2019, Punji et al. [29]. reported selective hydrogenation of nitriles to secondary amines catalyzed by an inexpensive and less toxic cobalt complex, (Xantphos)CoCl2. The reaction tolerated diverse functionalities. In 2019, the group of Beller [31] published six cobalt pincer type complexes were applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to amines. Herein, we presented a high-level DFT calculation-based mechanism insight on the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to secondary imines by transition-metal iron complex [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)Br(CO)] reaction. Mechanistic studies of the reaction may provide valuable insights into the transition metal catalytic system and aid in the development of improved protocols and provide valuable clues for further study."
1,Calculation details,"All the DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package [44]. Optimizations of structures with frequency calculations including reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were carried out with the M06-2X functional [45,46], and a mixed basis set employing the 6-311G (d,p) for C, H, N, O, and P and LANL2DZ basis set [46–48] for iron were used. To take solvation effect of benzene into account, SMD solvation model proposed by Truhlar et al. [49] was adopted in all types of calculations. All stable species were fully optimized without any geometric or symmetric limitation. The minima have zero imaginary frequency and transition states with only one imaginary frequency were examined by vibrational analysis. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) [50] calculations were carried out to ensure the linked two minima by each transition state. In the following sections, unless otherwise stated, the relative stabilities of all the species were discussed by the relative Gibbs free energies calculated in toluene at standard state. NBO charges were calculated on the basis of optimized structures. The 3D diagrams of optimized structures were visualized by UCSF Chimera [51,52]. The orbital coefficient was calculated by using the ORCA program [53]."
2,Results and discussions,"A comprehensive mechanistic study of the iron-catalyzed nitriles to secondary imines was carried out by means of a medium-size model including some simple reactants considered in this study. Among various reactions reported by Chakraborty and Milstein [20], we chose [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)Br(CO)] (1) and p-bromobenzonitrile (BrPhCN (2)) as the reaction substrate and the catalyst precursor for a detailed mechanistic study because the conversion and yield of the product were more than 99%. The reaction starts from the base-induced HBr elimination of catalyst precursor 1, which generates the catalytic active species A [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)(CO)]. In following discussions, the modeling of the catalytic cycle is presented from the interaction of the catalyst A ([(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)(CO)]) with substrates BrPhCN. First of all, we considered the different possible spin states of complex A to check the multiplicity with the lowest energy. It was found that the lowest triplet state was 10.3 kcal/mol more stable than the lowest singlet state. Of course, it should be aware of that, the substrate-catalyst interaction may induce the spin-crossover between singlet and triplet states. Thus, in the mechanism study, we considered reaction pathways on both the single and triple potential energy surfaces. The frontier molecular orbital for 1 A and 3 A are shown in Fig. 1 . As we can see from Fig. 1, Fe 3d6 cations for the complex 1A is in the low-spin electronic state of (dxz)2(dyz)2(dxy)2(singlet, S = 0). For the complex 3A is in the high-spin ground electronic state of (dz2)2(dxy)2(dyz)1(dxz)1 (triplet, S = 1). For 3A, the unoccupied Mos dominantly localized on Fe dx2-y2. The highest occupied molecule orbital (HOMO) is dominantly composed of 83.5% dxy (Fe), HOMO-1 and HOMO-2 are dominantly composed of 89.1% dz2 (Fe) and 35.8% (Fe), 56.4% (H) σFe-H. The SOMO dominantly localized on Fe dxz/yz. The linear coordination environment of the iron center in 3A leads to the formation of one σ bond between Fe 3dz2 and H 1s atomic orbitals. In the following discussions, all the relative energies were calculated from the calculated Gibbs free energies in benzene solution at 1 atm and 298.15 K. The total Gibbs free energies of 1 mol complex A [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)(CO)] in the triplet state, 1 mol of hydrogen, and 1 mol of substrate 2 were used as reference zero point of relative energy calculations. According to the theoretical results and for the clarity of discussion, we divided the reaction mechanism into two steps, as shown in Scheme 2 : Step 1) A catalyzed p-bromobenzonitrile (BrPhCN, 2) to benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) and primary amine transformation (BrPhCH2NH2); Step 2) condensation of benzaldimine with a primary amine to afford secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr)."
3,A catalyzed p-bromobenzonitrile to benzaldimine and primary amine transformation,"3.1 A catalyzed p-bromobenzonitrile to benzaldimine and primary amine transformation The calculated free energy profile leading to the BrPhCHNH and BrPhCH2NH2 is illustrated in Fig. 2 Fig. 3 present the optimized structures of selected intermediates and transition states. For the convenience of discussion, the atoms are numbered as depicted in Fig. 2. The first step is the dihydrogen activation by A which leads to the cis-dihydrido complex B via transition state TS(A + H2)/B. The intermediate B and p-bromobenzonitrile (BrPhCN, 2) undergo concerted proton transfer (PT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) steps via TS(B + 2)/(C + 3), generating the intermediate C. The next step, C can split into benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) and regenerate the active catalysis complex A. Further hydrogenation of BrPhCHNH by B will produce the primary amine BrPhCH2NH2 (4) through transition state TS(B + 3)/(4 + A). All these steps can occur on both the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces. From Fig. 2, we can see that, the reaction pathway on the triplet PES locates below the reaction pathway on the singlet PES. Along the triplet reaction pathway, the dihydrogen activation reaction is slightly endergonic by + 1.9 kcal/mol and the barrier height at 3TS( 3A + H2 )/3B is calculated to be 23.3 kcal/mol. Such a barrier suggests the direct addition of H2 to A is kinetically favorable and only needs to react at room temperature. For TS(A + H2)/B, the natural charge for H2 and H3 are −0.136 and 0.255, respectively, suggests H2 is a hydride-transfer and H3 is a proton transfer. The first hydrogenation step of benzadimine by 3B is easy to occur and reach equilibrium on the triplet PES, since the transition state 3 TS( 3B + 2)/( 3C + 3) is located only 7.9 and 7.7 kcal/mol higher than 3B + 2 and 3C + 3, respectively. The formation of intermediate 3C is slightly endothermic relative to the starting materials by +2.1 kcal/mol in free energy, which suggested that C is easily to be formed. For 3 TS( 3B + 2)/( 3C + 3), the natural charge for H2 and H3 are 0.433 and 0.062, respectively, suggests H2 is a proton-transfer and H3 is a hydrogen transfer. From Fig. 3, one can see that in the transition state 3 TS( 3B + 2)/( 3C + 3), the bond length of FeH3, CH3, N1 H2, and N2 H2 are 2.068, 1.154, 1.215, and 1.387 Å, respectively. In complex 3 C, the bond distance of FeH3, CH3, N1 H2, and N2 H2 are 2.592, 1.042, 1.990, and 1.038 Å, respectively. The N1 H2 distance of 3 C is elongated to 1.990 Å, which is about 0.972 Å longer than that for a complex 3B (1.018 Å). The FeH3 distance is elongated to 2.592 Å, which is about 0.987 Å longer than that in 3B (1.605 Å). The analysis results indicate that for 3 C, the H atoms of Fe and N are completely transferred to the C and N atoms of BrPhCN. The next step, 3C can split into BrPhCHNH and regenerate the active catalysis complex A. Through transition state 3 TS( 3B + 2)/( 3C + 3), the nitrile is hydrogenated directly to the imine, which is further reduce to a primary amine. The primary amine BrPhCH2NH2 (4) is formed and A is released rapidly by transition state 3TS( 3B + 3)/(4+3A). Our computations show that the regeneration of A has an activation free energy barrier of 18.5 kcal/mol, and the reaction is highly exothermic by −18.3 kcal/mol. The results suggesting that the formation of a primary amine and regeneration of active catalysis complex A is a facile process. In contrast to the first step from nitrile to imine, the second step from imine to primary amine is indeed relatively easy. The conversion of p-bromobenzonitrile (BrPhCN) to benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) and primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) has an overall energy barrier of 23.3 kcal/mol (Fig. 2), which should be feasible under the experimental conditions (90℃, C6H6 solvent, 30 bar H2) [20]. The overall reaction is thermodynamically favorable (−18.3 kcal/mol), it could be driven by benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) release. It is noteworthy that, although all species on the singlet PES including local minima and transition states, are found higher in energy than the corresponding species on the triplet PES, the two barrier heights along the singlet PES 27.8 kcal/mol at 1TS( 1A + H2 )/1B and 12.4 kcal/mol at 1 TS( 1B + 2)/( 1C + 3), are only 4.5 and 3.6 kcal/mol higher than those of 23.3 at 3TS( 3A + H2 )/1B and 12.4 kcal/mol at 3 TS( 3B + 2)/( 3C + 3) on the triplet PES, respectively. Therefore, we may expect that, at the low temperature, the dihydrogen activation and hydrogenation of benzaldimine should mainly occur on triplet PES, but with the elevation of temperature, the triplet reaction can also play important roles in both the steps."
4,Condensation of benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) with primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) to afford secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) with and without catalysis,"3.2 Condensation of benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) with primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) to afford secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) with and without catalysis 3.2.1 Noncatalyzed condensation reaction From the experiment by Milstein and Chakrabory [20], benzaldimine with primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) react to afford secondary imine. At first, we considered the condensation reaction benzaldimine with primary amine to get secondary imine without a transition-metal catalyst. Fig. 4 depicts the free energy profile (kcal/mol) for the condensation of benzaldimine with a primary amine to afford secondary imine (including NH3 and BrPhCHNH-assisted hydrogen-transfer step). Fig. 5 presents the optimized structures of selected intermediates and transition states. Once the primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) is formed, primary amine reacts with benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH), which undergoes intermolecular hydrogen migration to form complex D by transition state TS(3 + 4)/D. This step requires relatively high barrier height 48.2 kcal/mol. When this step is assisted externally by BrPhCHNH or NH3 molecule, the barrier height of TS(3 + 4)/D can be reduced to 42.7 and 38.9 kcal/mol, respectively. The assistance of external BrPhCHNH or NH3 molecule lowers TS(3 + 4)/D energy barrier by 5.5 and 9.3 kcal/mol. The generation of the complex D consists of a proton transfer and a CN bond formation. D is slightly endothermic (0.6 kcal/mol). Intramolecular hydrogen transfer then took place through transition state TSD/P generating final product secondary imine with concomitant release of NH3 as a byproduct. It requires overcoming an energy barrier of 47.5 kcal/mol, which slightly decreases to 43.8 and 40.0 kcal/mol when the reaction is assisted by one BrPhCHNH or NH3 molecule, respectively. From above discussions, we can see that, benzaldimine or NH3-assisted H-migration is essential in lowering the H-migration barriers in the steps of (3 + 4) → D and D → P. Finally, NH3 and the desired secondary imine product P (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) are evolved with an exothermic of −2.7 kcal/mol. The final step of the whole reaction is the step of finally forming the secondary amine. The free energies of TS(3 + 4)/D (NH3-assisted) and TSD/P (NH3-assisted) are 38.9 kcal/mol and 40.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Without a catalyst, the reaction of benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) with primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) to generate secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) needs to overcome an energy barrier of 40.0 kcal/mol (Fig. 4), which should be unfeasible under the experimental conditions. These unfavorable results let us to consider the condensation reaction with catalysis. 3.2.2 Transition metal-catalyzed condensation reaction The condensation of benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) with primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) to afford secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) by transition-metal iron complex [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)Br(CO)] (A) catalyst have been taken into account and the results are discussed. Fig. 6 depicts the free energy profile (kcal/mol) for the condensation of benzaldimine with a primary amine to afford secondary imine by transition metal catalysis. Fig. 7 present the optimized structures of selected intermediates and transition states. In the presence of A, the H transfer of BrPhCH2NH2 leads to E via transition state 3TS(3 + 4 + A)/E with barrier height 38.8 kcal/mol. The H transfer transition state 3TS(3 + 4 + A)/E can be reduced to 27.8 kcal/mol by the aid of a NH3 molecule. In comparison with the direct hydrogen transfer, NH3-assisted hydrogen transfer lowers the barrier by 11.0 kcal/mol, indicating that the process is enhanced by the aid of an NH3 molecule. The process is slightly exergonic (−1.3 kcal/mol). The proton of NH is then transferred from CH2 NH to N atom of CHNH, via transition state 3TSE/F with an energy barrier of 29.3 kcal/mol, and forming intermediate 3F (−2.8 kcal/mol), Subsequently, the hydrogen atom on ligand N1 is transferred back to NH2 via transition state 3TSF/P with an energy barrier of 23.8 kcal/mol, thus NH3 is released and the final product is produced, and the catalyst is also released again. For A catalyzed condensation of benzaldimine with primary amine, the proton of NH transferred from CH2 NH to N atom of CHNH, via transition state 3TSE/F is the rate determining step (30.6 kcal/mol). The reaction barrier heights with the catalyst are obviously lower than without catalyst, and the reaction is easier to proceed. In the catalytic cycle, secondary imines (P) can react with primary amine (4) or acetonitrile to produce trimerized products in the presence of metal catalyst. We consider the reaction of secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) with acetonitrile to form trimerized product. However, further reaction of secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) with acetonitrile to form trimerized product needs to overcome a high barrier which was calculated to be greater than 100 kcal/mol (see Fig. 8 ). The reaction of producing trimerized product is endothermic 6.9 kcal/mol. The spin density analysis (see Table 1 ) indicates that, the intermediates G and H, and transition state TSH/J are carbon-centred radicals (the two C atoms bonded to the N atom which coordinates to the Fe center), and their relative Gibbs free energies are all higher than 50 kcal/mol. Therefore, secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable product, while trimerized product cannot be formed."
5,Conclusions,"The iron complex [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)Br(CO)]-catalyzed the nitrile to secondary imines was investigated by means of DFT calculation with M06-2X level in benzene. The starting [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)Br(CO)] complex can generate the active species [(iPr-PNP)Fe(H)(CO)]. The whole mechanism is composed of two key processes: (i) A catalyzed p-bromobenzonitrile (BrPhCN) to benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) and primary amine transformation (BrPhCH2NH2); (ii) condensation of benzaldimine with a primary amine to afford secondary imine. The results suggest that the secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) production via TSD/P with a 47.5 kcal/mol overall barrier. Although using NH3 can lower the barrier height of the H-migration steps, without a catalyst, the barrier height of the benzaldimine (BrPhCHNH) reacts with primary amine (BrPhCH2NH2) to generate secondary imine (BrPhCH2NCHPhBr) is still as high as 40.0 kcal/mol, which should be unfeasible under the experimental conditions. The condensation of benzaldimine and primary amine to generate secondary imine with metal catalyst becomes kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than without catalyst. The overall energy barrier of the condensation (30.6 kcal/mol with metal catalyst) is lower than that of the reaction metal-free catalyst (40.0 kcal/mol). The condensation reaction can proceed at an experimental given temperature. The theoretical results provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism and fully explain the experimental facts. The conclusions of this study would undoubtedly be beneficial to the design of even better borrowing-hydrogen catalysis systems."
