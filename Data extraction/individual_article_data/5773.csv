0,Introduction,"Solar energy has become one of the most widely used clean energy at present. The major way of its application is to transform the solar energy into thermal energy or electrical energy [1,2]. In the process of application, the solar energy utilization ratio is seriously affected by its own intermittence, which makes the store of solar energy becoming the key issue to improve the solar energy utilization efficiency [3]. Thermal energy storage technology which based on phase change materials (PCMs) is considered to be the easiest and quickest way to maximize its utilization efficiency [4,5]. PCMs are capable to store the thermal energy produced by solar radiation through the phase change process which converts the sensible heat into latent heat, and release the stored energy by inverse process in a specific environment [6]. Motivated by this, various organic and inorganic PCMs have been reported recently. Among all these organic PCMs, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used due to its advantages such as adjustable melting/crystallization temperature, easy processing, high phase change enthalpy, excellent thermal/chemical stability, low cost, low toxicity, and anti-corrosiveness. Thus, it has been the most widely used organic substrate of composite PCMs [7,8]. However, the low thermal conductivity and the leakage of PEG after solid-liquid phase change seriously affect its application [9]. To enhance the shape-stabilization property and thermal conductivity of the composite simultaneously, one of the promising strategies is to prepare organic PCMs with three-dimensional (3D) porous foam skeleton consisting of high thermal conductivity materials as supporting frameworks. The considered high thermal conductivity materials include metals [10,11], multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [12], graphene [13–15] and BN nanosheets [16]. Yang et al. [17] first introduced graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and microcrystalline cellulose into aerogels, and obtained high thermal conductivity PCMs via a method of vacuum impregnation. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. [18] reported a method to prepare PCMs with high thermal conductivity by adsorbing PEG on a mineral substrate coated with carbohydrates. In consideration of the need of indoor energy-saving, Yang et al. [19] reported a kind of PCMs with shape stability through impregnating expanded graphite (EG) in PEG. These foamy frameworks could greatly enhance the thermal conductivity. However, the inherent defects of these materials, including high-cost of preparation, low yield, sharp decrease in the phase change and low direct photothermal conversion efficiency of visible light, have obstructed their applications in photothermal conversion and storage. Recently, MXenes as a novel two-dimensional (2D) layered material attracted much attention. The MXenes with general formula of Mn+1XnTx represents 2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, M refers to the transition metal, X is carbon or/and nitrogen, n is 1, 2, 3 and Tx denotes -OH,-F and other functional groups [20,21]. The characterized multilayered structures can be etched and stripped into single- or fewer-layer nanosheets similar to exfoliated graphite [22]. At present, etching the A elements from the layered MAX materials, Mn+1AXn (A is a III or IV A-group element), is the major preparation method of MXenes. Based on this procedure, MXenes could have lower cost and easier scale-up production than graphene, CNTs or any other widely used carbon materials. It should be emphasized that few-layered MXenes, due to good metallic conductivity and hydrophilic properties, have become an important unit for assembling functional materials. Since 2017, researchers have paid more attention on the photothermal performance of MXenes and their potential application in PCMs [23–27]. Lu et al. [24] constructed the MXene/PEG PCMs with thermal conductivity increase by 720% via a direct vacuum impregnation method. Nevertheless, the shape stability of the sample had not been mentioned and a sharp decrease in the phase change enthalpy was observed. Fan et al. [25] mixed the MXene and PEG directly to yield a PCM with photothermal conversion efficiency up to 94.5% with 20 wt% MXene. However, the thermal conductivity was enhanced only 52% compared with PEG. In the meantime, the detailed and comprehensive assessments for the solar-thermal conversion performance of MXenes in the PCM field have not been widely published. Hence, there is necessity to further study the potential application of MXenes as the solar energy storage skeleton on PCMs. In this study, we have fabricated 3D porous materials Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam via a freeze-drying method with ice as the template and demonstrated that the 3D MXene foam structures with excellent photothermal conversion and thermal conduction pathway through a small amount of fillers. Meanwhile, this 3D MXene foam enhances the shape stability of the materials effectively. In addition, by introducing PVA into the MXene foam skeleton, a strong interaction can be established and the processability of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam can be significantly improved due to the hydrogen bond between PVA and MXene. At the same time, we prepare porous 3D Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam by freeze drying to construct the PEG-based PCM. Subsequently, the PEG in the sample is solidified, and the obtained composite PCM is pressed to reduce the small amount of air remaining in the material. In this way, the abundant hydrophilic groups on the surface of MXene can be strongly adsorbed to the PEG molecular chain through hydrogen bonding and other effects. Finally, the thermal conductivity, shape stability and machinability of Ti3C2Tx/PEG can be improved simultaneously. In view of the importance of the MXene/PEG composite system, we systematically studied the effect of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam in the prepared PCM on the thermal conductivity, shape stability and photothermal conversion performance as solar energy storage materials. The composite Ti3C2Tx@PVA/PEG containing 7.68 wt% skeleton maintains 96.5% solar thermal conversion efficiency of pure PEG, while the thermal conductivity increases by 423.8%. Moreover, the actual melting enthalpy and crystallization enthalpy are measured as high as 131.1 J/g. At the same time, the mass fraction of PEG and PVA in the prepared composite material is greater than 93%, only a small amount of MXene (about 7 wt%) added leads to greatly improve both in thermal conductivity and photothermal performance of the composite material. Therefore, the composite material retained low-cost as the PEG matrix. This work also provides a new direction for the manufacture of MXene foam-based multifunctional materials, which have high-efficiency photothermal conversion properties and broad application prospects in solar energy utilization."
1,EXPERIMENT,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PEG (M n = 2000) was provided from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Lithium fluoride (LiF; ≥99%) and Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai, China). Ti3AlC2 (98%) was supplied by the Forsman Scientific Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Hydrochloric acid solution (HCl) was obtained from Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China."
3,Synthesis of few-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene,"2.2 Synthesis of few-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene We selected a mild etching method to obtain high quality few-layered Ti3C2TxMXene, where HCl and LiF were employed as etching agents. Commonly, 3 g of LiF and 60 mL of 9 M HCl solution were mixed up in a Teflon container and the mixture system was stirred 10 min. Subsequently, 2 g of Ti3AlC2 powder was slowly poured into the homogeneous acid solution under stirring, and the system temperature was maintained at 50 °C. After 36 h reaction, the obtained acidic suspension was washed with deionized water repeatedly until pH ≥ 5. After that, the black sediment was re-dispersed in deionized water and sonicated for 1 h under Ar ﬂow to obtain the Ti3C2TxMXene suspension."
4,Fabrication of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam,"2.3 Fabrication of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam The Ti3C2Tx@PVA foams were obtained via a freeze-drying process with ice as the template. Few-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene suspension and 3 mg/mL PVA solution mixed with different volume ratios and diluted to concentration 30 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL and 70 mg/mL with ultrasonication for 2 h to form homogeneous mixtures. After that, 1.25 mL of the uniformly mixed hydrosol was transferred to the hollow square Teflon mold with an aluminum foil at the bottom. The suspension was frozen at −18 °C and freeze-dried in a freeze dryer under 0.1 Pa pressure at −65 °C for 24 h. Finally, the Ti3C2Tx@PVA foams were obtained and designated as 30Ti3C2Tx@PVA, 50Ti3C2Tx@PVA and 70Ti3C2Tx@PVA respectively."
5,Preparation of composite PCMs,"2.4 Preparation of composite PCMs The preparation process of Ti3C2Tx@PVA/PEG composites are shown in Fig. 1 . Firstly, the PEG was melted completely in the glass beaker at 70 °C. The series Ti3C2Tx@PVA foams with different mass (size of 2 × 2 × 0.4 cm) were immersed into the melting PEG to complete infiltration PEG under vacuum condition for 2 h. The infiltrated composites were then transferred out from the molten PEG and placed it at room temperature to solidify it directly. Eventually, the obtained composite PCMs were pressed with an about 14.06 kg/cm2 force after the PEG in the samples solidified. The composite samples were designated as 30TPP, 50TPP and 70TPP respectively, according to the concentration of Ti3C2Tx in PVA solution when prepared foam."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The morphology and microstructure of Ti3C2Tx,Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam and composite PCMs were obtained using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8220, Japan, 15 kV) with EDS system and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Talos F200S, Czech, 200 kV). The crystalline behavior of samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Malvern Panalytical Aries, Netherlands) at room temperature with Cu Kα radiation at 15 kV and 40 mA. The data were collected in an angle range of 5~70° with a step width of 5°/min. The thermal properties of composite PCMs such as phase change enthalpy ΔH, phase change temperature and specific heat c p were measured through the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, METTLER TOLEDO DSC3, Switzerland). For the heating and cooling cycle test, analyses were conducted at 10 °C/min heating rate under a constant stream of N2 and a flow rate of 40 mL/min. For specific heat, the data was measured through a sapphire specific heat method in a temperature range of −45 °C~45 °C with a 10 °C/min heating rate under a constant stream of N2 and flow rate of 40 mL/min. Thermal diffusivity (α) of the composite PCMs was measured by the laser flash method using a laser thermal conductivity instrument (NETZSCH LFA 467, Germany). Thermal conductivity λ was calculated as a multiplication of thermal diffusivity ( α ), density ( ρ ) and specific heat ( c p ) ( λ = α × ρ × c p ). The shape-stabilization test was carried out by recording the optical images of the samples on a heating system, which heated the temperature of samples up from room temperature to 75 °C. During the test, the heating rate was set at 5 °C/min, and the system would stay for 5 min at 35 °C, 55 °C and 75 °C, respectively. In the photo-to-thermal energy conversion test, simulated sunlight provided by a CEL-HXUV300 xenon lamp (CEAULIGHT, China) with an AM 1.5 filter. Using an optical power meter (Linshang LS122, China) to verify the light irradiation power, and the temperature of each sample was recorded by a temperature recorder (MAGNITY MAG12-111703, China) during the test."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Microstructure of Ti3C2Tx MXene and few-layered nanosheets,"3.1 Microstructure of Ti3C2Tx MXene and few-layered nanosheets In this study, we selectively etched the Al layer from Ti3AlC2 by in-situ synthesis of HF to prepare few-layered MXene nanosheets. The XRD patterns of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Tx are shown in Fig. 2 a. The diffraction peaks of the purchased MAX phase are fully in agreement with the Ti3AlC2 (JCPDS No.052–0875) [28], the standard card of the Ti3AlC2has been shown at the bottom of Fig. 2a. There were obvious characteristic peaks at 2θ = 9.5°, 19.2°, 34.0°, 38.8°, 41.8, 48.6°, 52.4°, 56.6° and 61.0°, assigned to the (002), (004), (101), (008), (105), (108), (109) and (112), respectively. On the XRD spectrum of Ti3C2Tx, there is only one obvious characteristic peak at 6.9° and three weak diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 21.5°and 28.0° assigned to the (002), (004), (006) and (008), respectively. The disappearance of the main diffraction peaks of the MAX phase and the appearance of the diffraction peaks on the MXene curve indicate the successful transformation from the MAX phase to MXene. The different positions of the (002) peak of the two curves can further confirm the successful removal of the Al layer. At the same time, the broadening of the (002) peak shows the reduction in crystallinity and structural order. After calculation, the d-spacing of MXene at 6.9° was determined as about 1.28 nm. After 36 h of etching, the Al element originally existing in Ti3AlC2 was successfully removed, and the blocky Ti3AlC2 was transformed into accordion-like structure Ti3C2Tx as seen from the SEM images (Fig. 2b and c). In the accordion-like Ti3C2Tx, there is a van der Waals force between the adjacent layers [29]. After an hour of ultrasonic treatment, the weak van der Waals force between the layers was destroyed, and the accordion-like Ti3C2Tx was delaminated into flakes (Fig. 2d). After being etched, the large number of hydrophilic groups on the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets surfaces, such as -OH, resulted good dispersion of Ti3C2Tx in water, and it could be demonstrated by a typical Tyndall effect (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2e depicts the SEM micrographs of few-layered MXene nanosheets. The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.32 nm between two adjacent planes in the same direction can be observed in Fig. 2f, corresponding to the (008) peak of Ti3C2Tx in the XRD pattern."
9,Morphology of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam and composite PCMs,"3.2 Morphology of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam and composite PCMs The crystalline structure of composite PCMs was analyzed by XRD technique. The XRD patterns of Ti3C2Tx, PEG2000, PVA, Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam and the composite PCMs are shown in Fig. 3 a. The two characteristic peaks at about 19.2° and 23.3° are attributed to the diffractions of PEG. PVA had an obvious diffraction peak at about 20°. However, due to the low content of PVA in foam, the characteristic peak of PVA could not be observed in the XRD spectrum of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam. Compared XRD patterns of PEG2000 and composite PCMs, it was found that, the crystalline structure of PEG2000 was not affected by Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam. And there is no new characteristic peak observed in the composite PCMs, indicating that no chemical reaction occurred between PEG2000 and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. But, due to the lamellar structure of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets restricts the movement of the long chain of PEG2000, the crystallization region of PEG was affected, and the crystallization ability decreased, showing a decrease in the intensity of diffraction peaks at 19.2° and 23.3°. Compared XRD patterns of Ti3C2Tx with composite PCMs, the characteristic diffraction (002) peak of Ti3C2Tx shifted toward lower angle from 6.9° to 5.5° in the composite PCMs, and the (002) diffraction peak was weakened greatly. According to the Bragg equation (2dsinθ = nλ), the crystal d-spacing of Ti3C2Tx MXene at 6.9° is about 1.28 nm. After PEG2000 impregnating into the Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam, the calculated crystal d-spacing of Ti3C2Tx increased to 1.52 nm, which indicating some PEG2000 molecules inserted into the layers of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. Perhaps it can be speculated that the hydrogen bonds, formed between the hydroxyl groups at the terminal of the PEG molecular chain with the rich surface groups -OH of MXene, are in favor of the PEG2000 insertion into the layers of MXenes. This interaction of hydrogen bonds is also one of the main reasons for the improvement of shape-stable property of the composite PCMs [25]. Fig. 3b depicts the SEM micrographs of 30Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam. As can be seen, the cross-linking and stacking of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets constructed a 3D porous network, but the existence of PVA could not be obviously observed in the SEM image due to the low concentration of PVA solution. Compared with the pure MXene in Fig. 2d, the MXene nanosheets Fig. 3b became thicker. And without the introduction of PVA, Ti3C2Tx foam behaved inferior flexibility as previously literature reported [24]. When this foam stored in the air without artificial external force, it couldn't exist in a block, and the powder will continue to disperse due to the flow of air (Fig. S1). It is surprising that the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx@PVA foams with such a fascinating cross-linking architecture showed good flexibility behaviors, and the foams became stable and not collapsed withstand gently clamping with tweezers. This could be due to the relatively strong hydrogen bonds formed between the terminated groups (−OH) in PVA and the surface of MXene or among the neighboring nanosheets [30,31], which can play an important role in enhancing the interfacial interactions effectively and forming a strong network structure. Such a highly porous structure of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam can play a good role as a supporting framework to absorb the liquid PEG. During the vacuum impregnation process, PEG entered the pore of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam. The 3D porous skeleton of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam provided a large space for PEG filling, therefore the PEG content of the developed composite PCM material is up to 92.3 wt% ~96.3 wt% after the fast penetration of PEG in the Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam. Fig. 3c exhibited the surface SEM micrograph of composite PCM 30TPP. The fish scale-like sample surface could be observed from this SEM image. Fig. 3d shows the SEM image of the cross-section of the compacted composite PCMs, and the distribution of the Titanium element has been shown at the inset in Fig. 3d. No holes can be observed in the SEM image. The uniform distribution of Ti element can be seen through the mapping image, indicating that the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets have been uniformly dispersed in the process of dispersion."
10,Thermophysical properties,"3.3 Thermophysical properties TES performance is a necessary characteristic of composite PCMs, so it is important to investigate the capacity of thermal energy charging and discharging of the composite PCMs. The DSC curves of pure PEG2000 and PEG composite PCMs are shown in Fig. 4 a and Fig. 4b. It is obvious that all the composite PCMs samples exhibited one endothermic peak upon heating and one exothermic peak upon cooling. Table 1 listed the detailed thermal characteristics for pure PEG2000 and the composite PCMs from the DSC curves, the melting and crystallization temperatures are presented as T m and T c here, ∆ H m and ∆ H c present the actual melting and crystallization enthalpies respectively, ω P E G is the mass percent of PEG in the composites and phase change enthalpy retention R is the ratio of the melting enthalpy of the composites to the pure PEG 2000. As shown in Table 1, the T m of the composite PCMs revealed a slightly higher value compared with PEG2000 (52.9 °C), and the crystallization temperature T c of composite PCMs also exhibited higher temperature. As for pure PEG2000, ∆ H m is 144.7 J/g during the melting process and ∆ H c is 146.2 J/g for during the crystallization. Compared with pure PEG, melting latent heat of the composite PCMs is slightly shifted to 138.0 J/g, 135.3 J/g and 132.6 J/g, respectively, and the same slight decrease of solidification latent heat is also observed. It is worth mentioning that the thermal energy storage property of composite PCMs usually be reduced with adding conductive fillers or encapsulating agents because of the displacement of the active component. However, as mentioned in section 3.2, there was no chemical reaction between PEG and Ti3C2Tx@PVA foams after vacuum impregnation, so the active component of the phase change enthalpy of the composites was still PEG, and the thermal energy storage property of the materials decreased in an acceptable range due to the small amount of fillers. Therefore, the phase change enthalpy retention R was mainly used to evaluate the TES performance of PCMs, which R could be calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) R = ∆ H m − c ∆ H m − p × 100 % where ∆ H m − c presented the actual melting enthalpy of the composites, and ∆ H m − p present the melting enthalpy of the pure PEG. Through the calculation, the R of composite PCMs 30TPP is as high as 95.4%, while the R of composite PCMs 70TPP also reaches up to 91.6%, which is slightly higher than the other reported PEG-based PCMs level [32–35]. Furthermore, according to the weight of the samples recorded during the preparation process, the PEG2000 content ( ω P E G ) of each sample was calculated to be 96.3 wt%, 94.6 wt% and 92.3 wt%, respectively. With these PEG2000 contents, the theoretical phase change enthalpy ( ∆ H m − t ) of composite PCMs could be calculated by eq. (2) [25]: (2) ∆ H m − t = ∆ H m − p × ω P E G The calculated ∆ H m − t of composite PCMs 30TPP, 50TPP, 70TPP are 139.3 J/g, 136.9 J/g and 133.6 J/g respectively, according to the melting endothermic energy of 144.7 J/g of pure PEG2000. The crystallinity of the composite PCMs χ ( χ = ∆ H m / ∆ H m − t × 100 % ) was also calculated to evaluate the TES performance of composite PCMs [36]. The calculated crystallinity of as-prepared PCMs 30TPP, 50TPP and 70TPP are as high as 99.1%, 98.8% and 99.3%, which is also higher than the reported PEG-PCMs [25,32–35]. The reduction of crystallinity and ∆ H m can be attributed to the supporting effect of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam, this supporting effect possibly restricts the thermodynamic behavior and crystallization process of PEG to some extent [37]. In a conclusion, the thermal energy storage property of composite PCMs reduced slightly owing to conductive fillers Ti3C2Tx replacement of working substance PEG, but fabricated 3D porous Ti3C2Tx@PVA form as supporting frameworks avoided the sharp decrease of melting enthalpy of the PCMs. The R of composites is higher than 90%, which ensures efficient thermal energy storage performance for practical application."
11,Thermal stability,"3.4 Thermal stability For the practical application of PCMs, both excellent thermal cycling performance and thermal stability are also important characteristics. The thermophysical properties of 30TPP after thermal cycling are given in Fig. 4c. It is noteworthy that the changes of ∆ H m and ∆ H c under frequent heating/cooling cycling are positive, which means that the latent heats ∆ H m and ∆ H c of the composite PCM increased slightly. As clearly seen, 200th ∆ H m was about 2.5% higher than the first ∆ H m , and 50th ∆ H c of the composite PCM was up to 142.1 J/g, and 1.1% higher than the first ∆ H c (140.5 J/g). These outstanding results showed that the composite was kept stable regardless of frequent cycling, illustrating that the composite PCMs behave sterling long-term stability performance and excellent chemical stability. Some factors for improving the latent heat of composite PCMs under frequent thermal cycling will be discussed in detail below. The interaction between PEG and Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam may be very important and it has a positive effect on the phase change enthalpy. These interactions include both the CH3 ⋯ π interactions and hydrogen bond interactions between PEG and hydrophilic surface of MXene. Moreover, Qi groups [13] gave similar reports that graphene nanoparticles played an important and effective role in increasing the melting/crystallization enthalpies of PEG. In our study, another factor for the increase of phase change enthalpies is perhaps from Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam. As discussed in earlier work, the application of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam fastened penetration of PEG into the foam and this also led to high PEG content up to 96.3 wt% in PCM composite. The MXenes distributed in the porous framework also provided the enough space for the growth of larger crystallite sizes of PEG, which means that the Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam did not destroy the crystal structure, but promote the crystallization of PEG2000 slightly. Such improvement of the latent heats during solidification in organic PCMs has been reported as in graphene/graphene oxide built aerogel and graphene oxide nanosheets, due to crystal orientation of PEG in aligned graphene walls [13–15]. In our study, the values of ∆ H m and ∆ H c of the composite PCMs changed slightly before and after 200 thermal cycles (Fig. 4c), illustrating excellent thermal and chemical stability of the composite PCMs. As mentioned above, the fabricated 3D porous skeleton of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam fixed the long molecular chain of PEG. And the strong hydrogen interactions between PEG and MXene also fasten the long molecular chain of PEG in the composite. All of these factors improved the thermal stability of the composite PCM during many times of re-crystallization. In order to evaluate the chemical stability of the composite PCM during cycles, the FT-IR and XRD spectra (Fig. 4d and e) of the composite before and after the 200 cycles were considered. It was clear that the positions and shape of the peaks in both FT-IR and XRD spectra had no obvious change before and after the 200 thermal cycles, which further indicated that the composites have excellent thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, phase change materials are often used in the environment of large temperature differences in practical application, so the thermal reliability in the application temperature range is also an important parameter for phase change materials. The curves obtained from the TGA of pure PEG2000, pure MXene, and composite PCMs are shown in Fig. S2. Table S1 summarizes the onset degradation temperature T 5 (5 wt% weight loss) and weight loss at 100 °C and 680 °C. The temperature T 5 of pure PEG2000 and composite PCMs 30TPP, 70TPP are as high as 367.72 °C, 371.12 °C, and 360.15 °C, respectively, and the weight loss at 100 °C of pure PEG2000, 30TPP and 70TPP is just as 0.5 wt%, 0.72 wt% and 0.54 wt%, respectively. All these results indicated that the composite PCMs displayed excellent thermal and chemical reliability."
12,Shape-stabilization property,"3.5 Shape-stabilization property To evaluate the shape-stability of the as-prepared composites, the leakage test above the melting temperature was carried out. The samples were heated directly from 35 °C to 75 °C on a heating plate and the morphological changes at different temperatures were recorded by real-time monitoring using a digital camera. As shown in Fig. 5 a, all the samples retained their original shape at 35 °C for a long time. When the temperature increased to 55 °C, most of the pure PEG2000 melted into liquid and spread on the hot plate. In contrast, the composite PCMs with different MXene content maintained the original body shape, but it can be seen that the excess PEG2000 on the surface of each sample melted into liquid. When the temperature was raised up to 75 °C, the pure PEG2000 had completely melted into liquid, and spread out on the heating plate, while the composite PCMs kept visually its shape stability at 75 °C, the liquid around the bottom profile of the sample did not continue to increase, and there was no liquid leakage within 5 min at 75 °C. Based on this leakage test above, it is obvious that the as-prepared composite PCMs behave good shape-stabilization property in the range of phase change temperature. The efficient shape-stabilization property may be due to some factors which include: 1) the flow of molten PEG is restricted by the surface tension force; 2) the capillary actions from the porous structure of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam preserve PEG at higher temperatures than its melting point and prevent the leakage of molten PEG; 3) the strong hydrogen bond interactions as discussed between the hydroxyl groups of PEG and the surface groups of MXene also play important role to avoid the leakage of molten PEG. Actually, the leakage issue of PEG in different composite PCMs filled with carbon-based materials had attracted the attention of researchers. Qi et al. research group [13] investigated the shape-stability of PEG in as-prepared graphene foam. Their results indicated that graphene foam could preserve the PEG in the 3D interconnected porous structure when the temperature is 15 °C higher than the PEG melting point. The observations in our research work further confirmed that the Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam was also a convenient host for preventing the leakage of the melted PEG."
13,Thermal conductivity,"3.6 Thermal conductivity The thermal conductivity of PEG2000 and the composite PCMs were measured by the laser flash method, and thermal conductivity (λ) was calculated as a multiplication of thermal diffusivity ( α ), specific heat ( c p ) and density ( ρ ) ( λ = α × ρ × c p ). The measured thermal diffusivity and the calculated thermal conductivity are shown in Fig. 5b. Compared with the pure PEG2000, it was obvious that the thermal conductivity was greatly increased after introduction of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam as skeleton, and there was a positive correlation between thermal conductivity and the content of supporting filler. The Ti3C2Tx@PVA/PEG composite contained with 7.68 wt% skeleton exhibited a thermal conductivity of up to 0.428 W/(m·K), which was 4.2 times that of PEG2000 (0.101 W/(m·K)). In practical application, the rate of heat absorption and release of organic matrix was seriously limited by its low thermal conductivity, which became a fatal defect of organic PCMs. It is an effective strategy to add high thermal conductivity fillers such as metal Ag [32], single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) [38], graphene [39] and BN [16] into the composites to improve the thermal conductivity of organic PCMs. However, due to the uniform distribution of dispersed fillers, it is difficult to obtain a perfect and continuous heat conduction network, especially with the low content of fillers. The thermal conductivity of PCMs is improved by a very small margin. Moreover, with the addition of high weight contents of fillers, the TES property of composite PCMs is usually reduced sharply. To balance thermal energy storage property and the thermal conductivity, the low-content MXene@carbon-based 3D porous frameworks foam as supporting are promising choice to form high-performance PCM. A numerical contrast of the thermal conductivity enhancement and the phase change enthalpy retention R value of the as-fabricated Ti3C2Tx@PVA/PEG composite with other PEG-based composites reported previously are enumerated in Table 2 and Fig. 6 . It was obvious that the Ti3C2Tx@PVA/PEG composites in this study had higher thermal conductivity enhancement and phase change enthalpy retention than other filler/PEG materials and exhibited significant potential application in TES field. MXene, a novel family of 2D layered materials, has got much attention recently including in the fabrication of composite PCMs because of their metal-like conductivity. Fan et al. [25] mixed the MXene with the mass fraction of MXene 20% and PEG directly, found the photothermal conversion efficiency of PCM was 94.5%, but the thermal conductivity was enhanced by only 52.1% compared with pure PEG, and the R value was only 72.6%.In this study, highly porous Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam served as the supporting framework to adsorb molten PEG, and the large pore space of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam resulted composite PCMs with PEG content as high as 94.61 wt% and 92.32 wt%. The high PEG content in the composite PCMs was in favor of high latent heat value. Therefore, it is obvious that the R value of the composite PCMs prepared in this paper can be significantly higher than the average value. In addition, we should note that the promoting effect of Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam on the thermal conductivity in our work was high enough to be compared with the literature [25]. This marked improvement of thermal conductivity can be owed to some factors as: 1) Ti3C2Tx MXene is a good thermal conductive filler based on its intrinsic metal-like conductivity. 2) Secondly, a perfect-structured 3D network built by thermally conductive filler constructs an efficient thermal conductive path and reduces the probability of phonon scattering [40]. 3) The strong hydrogen bond interactions between the hydroxyl groups of PEG and the surface groups of MXene also lessens the interfacial thermal resistance effectively between PEG and fillers, and this is beneficial to the enhancement of thermal conductivity. 4) During the fabrication of the composite PCMs, the obtained composite PCMs were pressed to reduce the small amount of air left in the material. And the uniform dispersion of Ti3C2Tx in the compressed composite PCMs play a positive role in reducing the probability of phonon scattering and enhancing the heat transfer performance."
14,Photothermal conversion of composite PCMs,"3.7 Photothermal conversion of composite PCMs Highly photothermal conversion efficiency enables PCMs to exhibit excellent performance in solar energy storage. Fig. 7 is the schematic illustration of the experimental setup for characterizing the photothermal conversion performance of the samples. Before the test, the intensity of the light reaching the upper surface of the samples was set at 100 mW/cm2 by adjusting the distance between the simulated sunlight source and the samples. The time-temperature curves of different samples obtained from the photothermal conversion performance test are shown in Fig. 8 a and Fig. 8b. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated by the following equation: (3) η = m Δ Η m P ( t s − t e ) where m is the mass of the test sample, Δ H m is the melting enthalpy of this sample, P is the power of simulated solar radiation, t s is the start time of the melting process and t e is the end time of the melting process, which are obtained by the tangent method [25] (showed in Fig. 8a). Detailed data on photothermal conversion efficiency were listed in Table S2. At the beginning of the test, the surface temperature of all samples was 32.6 °C. The temperature of pure PEG2000 increased slowly during the test, and after 1250s, the temperature of PEG2000 was up to 43.4 °C, while the atmospheric temperature increased 10.8 °C. As for the detected composite PCMs, the temperature of composite PCMs 30TPP, 50TPP, and 70TPP reached 51.7 °C, 64.6 °C and 68.9 °C, respectively, and the increased temperature were 19.1 °C, 32.0 °C and 36.3 °C, respectively. Under the condition of the same illumination time, the temperature changes of four different samples were quite different, it was not difficult to draw the conclusion that the photothermal conversion performance of the sample increased with the increase of MXene content. Obviously that because 30TPP did not reach its own melting temperature, the curve did not reflect the melting process, while the curves of 50TPP and 70TPP clearly showed its melting process. In the melting process, the heating rate of the samples slowed down and the curve was relatively smooth, indicating that the energy was stored as latent heat. After turning off the simulated sunlight source, the surface temperature of all samples decreased, but there was a sharp contrast in the rate of temperature drop between composite PCMs and pure PEG. The difference of heating amplitude in the same long time illustrates that the MXene based composite PCMs has good photothermal conversion ability, and the same difference in cooling rate can be used as evidence that the introduction of MXene effectively enhances the thermal conductivity of the materials. It was obvious that the curves of 50TPP and 70TPP clearly showed its melting process. Through the tangent method, it was known that the melting process of 50TPP and 70TPP took place at 192.4s~576.2s and 210.2s~520.5s, respectively. The temperature of the two samples at the starting point of the melting process is agree with the DSC test results. Accordingly, after 3000 s, due to the release of the previously stored latent heat, the crystallization process could be observed on both the 50TPP and 70TPP curves, showing a gentle small peak. The photothermal conversion efficiency of 50TPP and 70TPP calculated on eq (3) is 87.0% and 96.5%, respectively, this result further supports the above conclusion that the photothermal conversion performance of the sample increased with the increase of MXene content. Comparing the curves of 50TPP and 70TPP, it can be found that the melting process of 70TPP was shorter than that of 50TPP, indicating 70TPP lost less heat to the environment during the test, and resulting in higher photothermal storage efficiency than 50TPP. The reason for the shorter melting process of 70TPP was that the higher MXene content of 70TPP increased the heating rate. In order to reflect the excellent photothermal conversion properties of composite PCMs in this study, some previously reported photothermal conversion properties of composite PCMs are listed in Table 3 . Typically, MXenes exhibits a relatively high extinction coefficient, which is comparable to other light-absorbing materials in the table, such as GO and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [23,45], so it has good photothermal conversion ability. Furthermore, compared with the direct physical mixing method to embed the optical absorption material into the polymer, the preparation of MXene into a 3D skeleton is more beneficial to the light absorption of MXene. So, no matter from the comparison of the rising temperature within a certain time, or based on the photothermal conversion efficiency, the photothermal conversion properties of the composites prepared in this paper are obviously superior to those previously reported."
15,Conclusions,"Here, we have successfully constructed Ti3C2Tx@PVA foam-supported composite PCMs with high energy storage density, enhanced thermal conductivity, excellent shape stability, high photothermal conversion rate and less filler content through freeze drying and vacuum impregnation methods. Compared with pure PEG, the prepared PCM avoids a significant decrease of phase change enthalpy, which overcome the disadvantages of the reported composite PCMs. In addition, the prepared composite PCM has a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 96.5%. While 7.68% by weight of the filler is used, the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM can be increased by 423.8%, and the phase change enthalpy can be as high as 131.1 J/g. The above characteristics indicate that the 3D MXene foam thermal conductive skeleton plays an important role in enhancing the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM, which is the key to achieving the high photothermal conversion efficiency of the composite material. Therefore, the composite material we prepared could have high expectations in solar energy conversion and storage applications."
